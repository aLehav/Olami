The #MeToo movement has 
focused primarily on high status 
figures — women speaking out 
against 
Hollywood 
moguls, 
powerful bosses and even our 
current president. Journalist 
Bernice 
Yeung’s 
recently 
published work, after years of 
investigation, focuses instead 
on the experiences of women 
in 
particularly 
vulnerable 
workplaces, such as janitors, 
farmers and domestic workers. 
Each 
year, 
the 
Wallace 
House at the University of 
Michigan recognizes a Knight-
Wallace journalist to give the 
prestigious 
Graham 
Hovey 
Lecture. Hovey was a New York 
Times journalist and served as 
the director of the fellowship 
program from 1980 to 1986. 
The fellowship program offers 
journalists the opportunity to 
study at the University for an 
academic year to collaborate on 
learning and create strategies to 
improve the field of journalism.
ProPublica reporter Bernice 
Yeung 
was chosen 
as 
this 
year’s 
featured 
fellow 
for 
her investigative work in the 
seemingly unheard voices of 

the #MeToo movement. Yeung 
has investigated the sexual 
assault of immigrant workers 
as a member of the “Rape in 
the Fields” reporting team and 
the sexual abuse of janitorial 
women through “Rape on the 
Night Shift.” Yeung published 
“In a Day’s Work: The Fight to 
End Sexual Violence Against 
America’s 
Most 
Vulnerable 
Workers” 
in 
March 
2018. 
Yeung’s 
investigation 
into 
the 
abuse 
of 
low-income 
women began years before the 
movement but has highlighted a 
sector of people previously left 
in the dark.
Yeung was originally learned 
about this issue after hearing 
the experience of one low-
income woman and the sexual 
harassment she endured.
“Is this a terrible but isolated 
event, or part of a larger 
problem that requires attention 
and reform?” she asked.
Yeung’s lecture focused on 
the experiences exclusive to 
low-income workers, explaining 
how this work environment is 
conducive to ongoing sexual 
harassment. 
Particularly 
in 
contrast to many famous faces 
of #MeToo, these women have 
limited options when it comes 
to abuse. There are language 

barriers, and in some cases the 
abusers are the sole interpreters 
for filing a report, resulting in 
reports of abuse getting “lost in 
translation.” These women face 

the threat of losing their jobs, 
being deported or receiving 
retaliation for speaking out.
“Low-wage 
immigrants, 
laboring 
in 
isolation, 
are 

at a unique risk for sexual 
harassment and assault,” Yeung 
said.
According 
to 
Yeung, 
our 
judicial system relies on the 

assumption that survivors will 
speak out, leaving many low-
income 
women 
unprotected. 
Domestic workers have also 

The city of Ann Arbor has 
impounded almost two dozen 
Bird scooters for violating city 
ordinances.
City Communications Director 
Lisa Wondrash said the scooters 
were 
improperly 
parked 
on 
sidewalks, streets or bike lanes, 
adding that the scooters also 
violate an ordinance mandating 
motorized vehicles not impede 
the public right-of-way.
“The 
company 
has 
been 
notified that their equipment 
has 
been 
collected 
by 
the 
city 
and 
is 
being 
securely 

stored at our Public Works 
Facility,” Wondrash wrote in 
an email to MLive. “The city 
welcomes 
alternative 
modes 
of transportation for residents 
and visitors, and city staff are 
actively working with Bird on a 
licensing agreement.”
In an interview with the 
Detroit Free Press, Wondrash 
said finding appropriate places to 
park the scooters was “a question 
for Bird Scooter to answer.” 
The University of Michigan’s 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security, however, advised users 
of the scooters park them at bike 
racks or in moped parking areas.
“When you are finished riding 

Last 
month’s 
Michigan 
state primary election saw a 
higher voter turnout rate than 
any primary election since 
1978. The nearly 30 percent 
statewide voter turnout was 
up 6.7 percentage points since 
2010, indicating Michiganders 
are more engaged with the 
midterm elections than in 
recent years.
This jump in voter turnout 
was not isolated to Michigan 
but swept across the country 
this summer. According to 
the Pew Research Center, 
nearly half of registered voters 
report being more enthusiastic 
than usual about voting. As of 
late July, overall turnout in 
U.S. House of Representatives, 
U.S. 
Senate 
and 
state 
gubernatorial races outpaced 
2014 levels.
For House primaries, both 
Republican 
and 
Democrat 
turnout has increased, though 
Democrat turnout has risen 
more significantly. As of late 
July, the number of votes 
cast in Democratic House 
primaries is 84 percent higher 
than at the same point in 2014. 
Turnout for the Republican 
House primaries rose too by 
24 percent.
Michigan also witnessed 
this partisan trend. Across the 
state, the turnout rate spiked 
the most in counties former 
Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton won in the 2016 
presidential 
election. 
In 
Washtenaw County, where 68 

percent of the 2016 vote went 
to Clinton, voter turnout is up 
12.8 percentage points since 
2010.
Michael Traugott, research 
professor at the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Center 
for 
Political 
Studies, 
said 
the 
higher 
turnout 
among 
Democrats 
can 
be 
partly 
attributed to the outcome of 
the 2016 presidential election 
and a response to the current 
administration.
“There’s a lot of angst still 
among the Democrats about 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
2016 
election,” Traugott said. “And 
then concern I think about 
the 
behavior 
of 
President 
Trump, so in anticipation of 
the general election in the 
fall, Democrats are motivated 
to select good candidates, 
which is what happens in the 
primary.”

As for the Republican side, 
higher national turnout may 
be a result of competing forces 
within the party.
“In both parties, actually, 
there are some issues about 
some 
of 
the 
new 
party 
candidates 
and 
old 
party 
candidate,” 
Traugott 
said. 
“On 
the 
Republican 
side, 
there’s 
a 
contest 
between 
a particular kind of reform 
Trump candidate, and more 
traditional Republicans.”
The high primary voter 
turnout provides promise for 
large voter turn out in this 
November’s midtermelection. 
Erin Byrnes heads the Big Ten 
Voting Challenge on campus, 
an 
initiative 
among 
the 
fourteen Big Ten Conference 
schools to increase student 
turnout through competition. 
Byrnes finds the voter turnout 
rates in August encouraging 

and 
believes 
they 
are 
harbingers of high turnout 
rates in November.
“Voters across our state are 
energized, paying attention 
and 
voting,” 
Byrnes 
said. 
“Primaries are often seen 
as forgotten elections, with 
voters more focused on the 
general in November. That 
was not the case this year, and 
we can likely look forward to a 
great increase in turnout this 
fall.”
Madison 
McKenzie, 
graduate assistant at the U-M 
Ginsberg Center, agrees more 
students across the country 
are 
becoming 
politically 
engaged and motivated to vote.
“I think we hit really a 
lull, or actually a peak in 
terms of apathy across the 
country 
especially 
among 
young 
people,”

Criss graduated in 2009 
from the School of Music, 

Theatre 
& 
Dance 
with 
a 
Bachelor of Fine Arts in theater 
performance, quickly rising 
to fame in 2010 on the cast of 
“Glee.” He won the Emmy for 
Lead Actor in a Limited Series 
for his portrayal of Andrew 
Cunanan, the murderer of 
iconic fashion designer Gianni 
Versace, in “The Assassination 
of Gianni Versace: American 
Crime Story.”
The FX series was produced 

by Ryan Murphy and is the 
second season in the “American 
Crime 
Story” 
production, 
following “The People v. O.J. 
Simpson.” Murphy was also the 
producer of “Glee.”

September 19, 1972-- 
About 35 persons picketed 
the Flame, said to be a gay bar, 
on Washington St. Saturday 
night from midnight until 
about 2:30 a.m., demanding 
that its owner stop alleged 
discrimination against “drag 
queens.”
The demonstration was 
planned by a group of Gay 
Libera-tion Front (GLF) 
members, but “other gay 
people, who do not generally 
come to GLF meetings” 
were present and picketing, 
according to Jim Toy, GLF 
member and the University’s 
Gay Student Advocate.
Also present were several 

members of the Human 
Rights Party (HRP), including 
Jerry De Grieck and Nancy 
Wechsler, the two City 
Council members from that 
party.
Although the major 
complaint of the protesters 
was Flame owner Harvey 
Blanchard’s alleged barring of 
“drag queens” (transvestites), 
a leaflet handed out to 
passers-by also called for 
“improvement of the physical 
environment of the Flame — 
a dance license and room to 
dance, bet-ter music,” and 
“no selective harassment o 
r discrimination a g a i n s t 
people by Harvey (Blanchard) 

or other employes.”
Blanchard, who says he 
is “looking into” a dance 
license,” maintains he does 
not discriminate. “I have 
barred a couple of people 
because of their behavior in 
the bar, not because they’re 
gay,” he said.
He added that he ordered 
people dressed in drag out of 
the bar because “there were 
only a
few, and they were going 
into the women’s john.”
He said he is checking 
into the law with regards to 
transvestites and “if they do 
have a point that it is legal,” 
he will let them back in. 

State law forbids men 
dressed in women’s clothing, 
but organizers of the protest 
say the city’s human rights 
ordinance, which forbids 
discrimination on the basis 
of sex in matters pertaining 
to housing, employment, and 
public accommodations, will 
apply.
According to Harry 
Kevorkian, GLF member, if 
Blanchard refuses to allow 
“drag queens” into the bar, 
protesters may force a test 
case under the ordinance, 
which was passed by City 
Council during the summer. 
Kevorkian also accused 
Blanchard of “hassling gay 

women, and straight people.” 
“He wants a white middle 
class straight gay bar,” 
Kevorkian said. “Everyone has 
to look like white middle class 
males.” 
Blanchard asserts that 
he bars people because of 
“behavior it has nothing to do 
with whether they’re gay or 
straight.”

Students Allied for Freedom 

and 
Equality, 
a 
Palestine 
solidarity organization at the 
University of Michigan, released 
a 
statement 
on 
Facebook 
Tuesday evening stating the 

organization stands in solidarity 
with the students and staff 
members 
boycotting 
Israeli 
universities. 
The 
statement 
came 
in 
response to an incident in 
which University professor 
John 
Cheney-Lippold 
rescinded his offer to write 
LSA junior Abigail Ingber 
a letter of recommendation 
for a study abroad program 
in 
Israel. 
The 
email 
exchange was posted to 
Facebook in a screenshot 
Sunday by Club Z, an 
organization 
that 
works 
to empower and network 
Jewish students who are 
committed to Zionism. 
Cheney-Lippold 
has 
received 
backlash 
and 
claims 
of 
anti-Semitism 
from 
students 
and 
community 
members 
regarding his decision to 
revoke his recommendation 
letter. 
SAFE’s statement begins 
by presenting examples of 
the human rights violations 
on Palestinian land, writing 
“there is no question of 
the violence and inequity 
perpetuated 
by 
settler-
colonial Israeli apartheid.”
“We support and affirm 
Professor 
John 
Cheney-

Lippold’s right to boycott Israel,” 
SAFE statement reads. “His 
actions are the same demanded 
by Palestinian civil society, and 
serve to recognize and resist 
forces committing human rights 
violations. To punish Professor 
Cheney-Lippold for his actions 
would curtail his own academic 
agency.” 
SAFE also points out how 
quickly the University responded 
to this incident. The statement 
says students have been placed 
on 
a 
political 
blacklist 
for 
speaking against human rights 
violations in Palestine, and the 
University has never released a 
statement on that issue. 
“There has been no University 
statement on the matter. This 
blacklist is just one of several 
tangible barriers for students 
that will prevent them from 
engaging in not just study 
abroad programs, but academic 
programs, jobs, and admittance 
into Palestine/Israel.”
The University of Michigan 
Public Affairs issued a press 
release in response to the email 
Monday evening, condemning 
the boycott of Israeli institutions 
of higher learning. 
Ignber was unable to comment 
to The Daily earlier this week 
due to waiting on proceedings 
with the University.

with whom he exchanged explicit 
photos.
In 
addition 
to 
his 
online 
messaging, 
Hoeltzel 
was 
under investigation for engaging in 
sexual acts with a patient, whom he 
was allegedly over-medicating for 
rheumatoid arthritis. The patient 
was also diagnosed with various 
mental health illnesses.
Though 
only 
charged 
last 
year, Hoeltzel was investigated 
by University of Michigan police 
in 2006 amid complaints from 
a mother of an 11-year-old girl 
who found inappropriate Yahoo 
messages between the girl and 

Hoeltzel. 
Hoeltzel 
first 
began 
messaging the girl after they met at 
a U-M arthritis camp in 2004, after 
which the conversations continued 
for two years. Hoeltzel was asked to 
take a “boundaries class” in lieu of 
further investigation or punishment.
Six of Hoeltzel’s original felony 
charges were dismissed under his 
plea agreement, including receiving 
and possession of child pornography, 
production of child pornography, 
enticement of a minor, and three 
counts of transfer of obscene 
materials to a minor.
Hoeltzel’s presentence calls for 
him to serve for 14 to 17 years, and 
he will have to federally register 
as a sex offender. His sentencing is 
scheduled for Dec. 13 before U.S. 
District Judge Arthur Tarnow.

the scooter, it’s important to 
keep it from interfering with 
the public right of way. Do 
not leave the scooters parked 
on the roads, sidewalks, bike 
paths, 
driveways, 
access 
ramps, stairways, landscaped 
areas or near fire hydrants,” 
DPSS announced in an online 
statement. 
“Scooters 
must 
be parked in bike racks or 
moped parking areas. Please 
 
walk the scooter to the bike 
rack if you must traverse a 
sidewalk.”
Dozens 
of 
the 
scooters 
were dropped in Ann Arbor 

two weeks ago without prior 
notice to the city, requiring 
city officials to deal with the 
unexpected problems caused 
by their presence. The city 
has since issued a statement 
saying the use of the scooters 
could merit a ticket and has 
now 
begun 
removing 
the 
scooters from public areas. 
According to a map in the Bird 
mobile app, the number of 
active scooters in the area has 
been reduced to roughly 50.
The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Transportation 
Commission met Sept. 12 to 
discuss the Birds and the 
problems 
posed 
by 
their 
sudden 
presence. 
The 
commissioners 
resolved 
to 

create a charter for a task force 
or advisory committee to aid 
the city in dealing with the 
scooters and voiced support 
for regulating the scooters in 
a similar manner to electric 
skateboards, which can now 
be used in city streets.
LSA junior Seth Allen, a 
frequent Bird user, has noticed 
there are fewer scooters in the 
city and on campus since the 
crackdown. He expressed his 
hope that the Birds stay in the 
city in the future.
“I think that they’re a 
great way to get somewhere 
in a hurry, especially if it’s 
an awkward distance where 
you don’t necessarily want to 
 
bike there but you don’t want 

to walk there either,” Allen 
said. “It’s very convenient.”
Allen plans to continue 
using the Birds regularly if 
they stay in Ann Arbor and is 
in the process of becoming a 
charger for the scooters.
Though Bird’s relationship 
with the city has been rocky 
since their deployment, it 
appears likely that they will 
continue to be allowed — 
albeit regulated — in the 
future. Wondrash has stated 
the city is currently working 
on 
a 
licensing 
agreement 
with 
the 
company 
that 
would 
include 
stipulations 
 
allowing the scooters to be 
parked in sidewalk extensions 
out of pedestrian traffic.

only protect companies with 15 
or more employees.
Many of the women Yeung 
interviewed explained the risks 
are too high to report these 
incidents. Many victims are 
the sole breadwinner for their 
children and take on these low-
wage jobs simply to support 
them. Yeung explained the risk 
of their livelihoods is a lot to 
someone who is just trying to 

earn a paycheck through an 
honest day’s work.
“The only rational thing to 
do is to say nothing,” Yeung 
quoted.
Not all of these workers 
have remained silent. Georgina 
Hernandez came to the United 
States with her six children 
after 
fleeing 
her 
abusive 
husband and found a job as a 
nighttime janitor in California. 
Her boss threatened to fire 
her, deport her and hurt her 
daughter if she did not concede 
to his sexual advances. Silent 
for years about the abuse, 
Hernandez is now in a leader in 
a California janitors’ union. She 

is proactive in helping others 
after learning how to help 
herself and hearing the stories 
of many other women in similar 
positions as her.
The Fair Food Program has 
recently 
emerged, 
enforcing 
a zero tolerance policy for 
sexual harassment. If farmers 
don’t abide, they can’t sell their 
produce 
to 
grocery 
stores. 
This program is one of many 
started by women working in a 
vulnerable environment.
Yeung ended her lecture by 
redirecting the attention to 
the purpose of the #MeToo 
movement. She stated these 
women have been overlooked 

and undervalued, and deserve 
justice, in whatever capacity 
that may entail. Some of these 
women 
want 
their 
abusers 
fired, others want to face their 
abusers and some simply want 
to be believed. Justice is highly 
individualized, 
but 
Yeung 
emphasized her belief that 
the next step of the #MeToo 
movement is to use the current 
spotlight 
to 
showcase 
the 
stories of low-income women 
and 
to 
shape 
preventative 
policies.
“Justice is the absence of the 
transgression happening in the 
first place,” Yeung said.

said. “There’s been effort in the 
last few years to really educate 
students on what is happening 
around and them and how their 
vote actually impacts what their 
lives are.”
According to Byrnes, the 
University had a 14 percent voter 
turnout rate in 2014. Traugott 
says this follows a national 
youth voting pattern.

“In general, there’s a kind of 
inverted J distribution between 
age and turnout,” Traugott said. 
“So turnout is low among young 
people, it grows, and then as 
people get older and maybe get a 
little infirmed their turnout rate 
declines.”
Traugott explains these low 
student turnout rates could be 
because voting is an acquired 
behavior; 
it 
takes 
practice, 
and young people haven’t gone 
through enough iterations to 
have the routine down yet.

Students from out of state 
may not be aware of the process 
for 
requesting 
an 
absentee 
ballot and miss deadlines as a 
result. 
Alternatively, 
out-of-
state students may be detached 
from their own local politics.
Traugott says another reason 
for low student turnout rate 
could be lack of progressive state 
voting laws. Unlike other places, 
Michigan has no early voting 
sites nor no-excuse absentee 
ballots, and state identification 
is required to vote.

This month the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
along with the Michigan State 
University 
chapter 
and 
the 
Michigan Federation of College 
Democrats, 
announced 
they 
were suing the state over two of 
its voter registration laws. 
One of the main goals of 
the Big Ten Voting Challenge is 
to energize the youth vote and 
make midterm election turnout 
comparable to the presidential 
election turnout.
“The 
Big 
Ten 
Voting 

Challenge aims to increase (the 
14 percent turnout rate in 2014) 
by at least 200 percent, which 
would place us in the realm of 
typical college student turnout 
in a presidential election year, 
which hovers in the low to high 
forties,” Byrnes said. 
The Big Ten Voting Challenge 
has been able to register 12,000 
students to vote since 2016 using 
TurboVote, an online resource 
that provides voting information 
and sends the user election 
reminders. The Big Ten Voting 

Challenge aims to continue to 
help students register to vote in 
Michigan as well as their home 
states.
As election day approaches, 
the Big Ten Voting Challenge 
will 
be 
vamping 
up 
their 
marketing and outreach efforts. 
Byrnes said some get-out-the-
vote 
strategies 
will 
include 
signage 
across 
campus 
and 
an initiative called “Buses to 
Ballots”, which will provide 
transportation to the polls for 
students on election day.

H

ip-hop 
star 
Mac 
Miller was found dead 
in his home on 
Sept. 7, 2018 at 26 years 
old. His overdose hit 
the media like a wave, 
with strong responses 
of mourning on social 
media platforms from 
both fans and fellow 
artists who respected 
his work. Miller was 
extremely open about 
his struggle with drug 
use, 
referring 
to 
it 
in many of his lyrics 
and 
interviews, 
oftentimes 
acknowledging 
the 
negative 
effects of continued use.
In 
a 
2015 
Billboard 
interview, Miller spoke about 
his substance abuse at its peak, 
saying, “It just eats at your 
mind, doing drugs every single 
day, every second. It’s rough 
on your body.” This premature 
tragedy comes in the wake of 
pop star Demi Lovato’s well-
documented relapse earlier this 
summer, when she was taken 
to a Los Angeles area hospital 
after 
a 
reported 
overdose. 
Lovato is another artist who 
has consistently addressed her 
drug habit (in addition to her 
eating and bipolar disorders) 
in music and with the press. 
She had recently released a new 
song “Sober” that recounted 
her relapse when she overdosed 
in July. Lyrics of the song 
include “I’m sorry that I’m here 
again. I promise I’ll get help.”
However, 
Miller 
and 
Lovato are rare examples of 
Hollywood elite who actually 
acknowledge the devastating 
effects 
of 
substance 
abuse 
disorders. To many, it seems 
as 
though 
celebrities 
are 
destined to live their lives with 
drug habits by virtue of their 
exposure to a celebrity culture 
that champions drug use. This 
is only emphasized by the 
constant glorification of drugs 
and alcohol by our media, with 
movies and music glorifying 
the high while consistently 
avoiding the struggle of living 
with a substance abuse disorder. 
The mental and physical toll of 
continued drug use is extreme, 
as evident from the 72,000 
deaths in 2017 caused by drug 
overdose, as estimated by the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Artists like Miller 
and Lovato have attempted to 
highlight this dark and hidden 
portion of addiction to the 

public, attacking the glamorous 
view of drug use.
The narrative 
of 
chic 
and 
sophisticated 
drug-using 
celebrities leaves 
out some crucial 
facts 
about 
addiction. A life 
of 
substance 
abuse 
is 
not 
sustainable. 
Celebrities 
are 
not untouchable. 
Anyone can be 
affected. 21.5 million American 
adults (12 and above) were 
reported to have a substance 
abuse disorder in 2014. These 
staggering numbers, and the 
recent newsworthy examples 
of Miller and Lovato highlight 
that substance abuse does not 
discriminate.

Regardless 
of 
your 
net 
worth or follower base, the 
negative effects are going to 
come. The highs are high, 
but the lows lead a user down 
a dangerous road. And the 
dangers of this attitude are 
not restricted to Hollywood, 
but are rather increasingly 
prevalent in our larger society. 
This is especially true across 
high 
schools 
and 
college 
campuses, where in place of 
status equating invincibility, 
students 
and 
young 
adults 
equate it with youth.
I would be remiss if I did not 
point out that substance abuse 
disorders are vastly different 
than 
casual 
drinking 
and 
smoking, which are common 
in all types of communities 
and do not indicate severe 
substance 
abuse 
issues. 
Substance 
abuse 
disorders 
are when these habits become 
addictive, necessary to one’s 
way of life. This reliance is 
explained by the Center on 
Addiction, 
which 
defines 
addiction 
as 
“a 
complex 
disease of the brain and body 

that involves compulsive use of 
one or more substances despite 
serious 
health 
and 
social 
consequences.” When someone 
focuses on a consistent need for 
drugs above good health and 
social relationships, substance 
abuse becomes a severe risk.
While 
these 
disorders 
may originate from an initial 
stage 
of 
choice, 
addiction 
quickly becomes compulsory. 
Substance 
abuse 
disorders 
should 
be 
tackled 
with 
the same tenacity as other 
diseases, but in our society 
only one in nine Americans 
get support and treatment for 
their addiction. The societal 
view of drug abuse as fun and 
cultural 
discourages 
those 
who feel its daily struggles 
from reaching out for help. 
A general reliance on these 
substances can be perceived as 
weak and embarrassing, adding 
to this fear of getting help. 
While people are struggling, 
overdosing and dying, others 
continue to support a culture 
that praises these habits and 
then judges them when they 
get out of hand.
When Miller passed away, 
social 
media 
became 
an 
outpour of support, love and 
mourning for the late artist. 
After 
hitting 
mainstream 
media with his debut album 
Blue 
Slide 
Park 
in 
2011, 
Miller was a prominent artist 
in his genre. Other artists 
looked up to his work, while 
a large community of fans 
were inspired, moved and 
some would say raised on his 
sound. Miller was preparing 
for an American tour when 
he passed away. His legacy 
is incomplete, and the shock 
of his tragic loss to both his 
colleagues and fans should 
be a signal to take substance 
abuse off of a pedestal. 
We 
need 
to 
accept 
substance abuse as a disease 
and address its effects from 
that perspective. We need to 
stop focusing on momentary 
release 
and 
instead 
zero 
in on long-term health and 
happiness. We need strong 
individuals to continue to 
speak out about the darkness 
and struggle that comes with 
substance abuse so that people 
can receive the help that they 
need.

Substance abuse does not discriminate

Substance absue 
disorders should 
be tackled with 
the same tenacity 
as other diseases.

S

top 
talking 
about 
special 
counsel Robert Mueller and 
his investigation. To close a 
few loopholes of this request, I’d also 
add Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, 
George Papadopoulos and any of the 
other bit players in Trump’s orbit to 
that list. It’s rarely more substantial 
than media spectacle and offers only 
an illusory sense of resistance 
to those dissatisfied with the 
current government.
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
victory in 2016 unleashed a particular 
kind of liberal psychosis that wasn’t 
triggered when they lost the Senate 
in 2014, or when they lost the House 
of Representatives in 2010, or when 
they lost the Supreme Court with 
Justice Antonin Scalia’s nomination 
in 1971, or when they lost 910 
statehouse seats during Barack 
Obama’s presidency. As we began 
to see with President George W. 
Bush, and as we’re seeing fully 
now with Trump, the Democratic 
spirit is extremely lethargic. Unless 
there’s a single monster to mobilize 
against, American liberals tend 
toward complacency.
This isn’t entirely surprising. 
Conservatism rests on the idea that 
there must be perpetual struggle 
toward a prior state of society; 
liberalism rests on the idea that 
marginal improvements are enough 
to keep the arc of history bending 
toward justice. It takes something 
dramatic — a reality TV star, a 
billionaire without bourgeois values, 
a man called incompetent by enemies 
and allies alike — to break the patient 
faith of liberals.
Mueller’s 
special 
counsel 
investigation, which began May 17, 
2017, has soothed the anxiety of many 
people whose trust in American 
institutions was shaken in 2016. A 
narrative emerged from the chaotic 

horror of November that year: the 
noble underclass of the Midwest 
was tricked into electing this man 
by Russians, but the Americans 
who aided and abetted them will 
be brought to justice. Every news 
story that comes out of Mueller’s 
investigation — like former Campaign 
Chairman Paul Manafort’s guilty 
plea last Friday — is another nail 
being pounded methodically into 
Trump’s coffin.
The way this spectacle unfolds 
— CNN and the New York Times 
publish stories, a hashtag starts to 
trend on Twitter, #Resistance grifters 
like the Krassenstein brothers start 
making bad jokes — is similar to the 
way we react to prestige TV. A “Game 
of Thrones” episode airs, people turn 
to Twitter, celebrities start weighing 
in. Rinse and repeat.
However, this isn’t — as dozens 
of other columnists have said before 
— reality TV. American politics has 
given over entirely to what’s most 
entertaining, and we wait with 
anticipation for the next episode. 
This isn’t inherently wrong — I’m 
not particularly interested in parsing 
whether or not the net benefit 
from increased (but low quality) 
engagement with politics is good or 
not. What’s much more discomfiting 
for me is the unironic, self-serious 
way people participate in what isn’t 
much more than D.C. media drama.
Superficial victories presented 
like plot twists in a novel or television 
show, such as Manafort and Flynn’s 
plea deals and that anonymous Op-Ed 
from within the administration, have 
become acceptable substitutes for 
actual victories. Manafort is a self-
interested, morally bankrupt leech 
— one of thousands in Washington, 
D.C. I don’t really care whether he 
goes to prison or not because he 
doesn’t control policy or legislation; 

the Republican House, Republican 
Senate, 
Republican 
presidency, 
Republican Supreme Court and (in 
a plurality of states) Republican state 
governments do.
Even if the “blue wave” arrives 
as forecasted, Democrats — the kind 
who attack the president on Twitter 
and glorify a man who opposed 
them at nearly every stage of his 
career — will only control one of 
five battlegrounds. Maybe in 2020, 
California Sen. Kamala Harris or 
former Vice President Joe Biden will 
beat Trump by sufficiently scolding 
Americans about civility, and then 
they’ll control two out of five.
The fundamental problem with 
recovering political ground for the left 
isn’t that Republicans are a party of 
Machiavellian, ice-chewing maniacs 
assisted by the Russian government — 
they routinely elect some of America’s 
most embarrassing citizens — it’s that 
the Democratic base and founding 
principles (i.e., liberals and liberalism) 
are 
unequipped 
to 
deal 
with 
radicalizing conservatism. The right 
wing’s presentation of a Manichean 
battle between everything you love 
and everything you hate is a lot more 
mobilizing than patient Democratic 
centrism or the ostensibly apolitical 
Mueller investigation.
The powerful should be brought 
to justice when they break the law — 
few people find that controversial. 
When that process is turned into a 
comforting spectacle offered in lieu of 
economic, material progress, though, 
it should be ignored. Focus on moving 
the Overton window, pursue direct 
action and stop following the Mueller 
story — it’s not going to solve any of 
our actual problems.

o the Editor,
We 
are 
former 
members of the Board 
of Regents of the University 
of 
Michigan, 
representing 
different political parties and 
times in office. What unites 
us is our love of the University 
that we so proudly served 
and 
our 
frustration 
with 
the misimpressions of the 
University’s Investment Office 
and 
its 
relationship 
with 
U-M donors and benefactors 
created by a series of articles 
in the Detroit Free Press, the 
most recent of which ran on 
Sept, 13, 2018.
Creating 
the 
Investment 
Office as a unit separate 
from the Treasurer’s Office 
in 1999 was an important 
decision made by University 
leaders at the time. These 
leaders, including the Board of 
Regents, understood well that 
with declining state support 
it was increasingly important 
to 
grow 
the 
University’s 
endowment 
through 
the 
generous 
private 
support 
of alumni and friends. And 
they knew it was important 
to make prudent investments 
with those funds that had the 
potential to generate strong 
returns to help meet our 
academic priorities as public 
sources of funding declined. 
These include scholarships for 
students with need, supporting 

research to find better ways to 
manage common diseases, such 
as diabetes, cancer and heart 
disease, and so much more.
Nearly 
20 
years 
of 
experience 
has 
continued 
to 
show 
the 
wisdom 
of 
this 
decision. 
Today, 
the 
University’s 
endowment 
stands 
at 
more 
than 
$11 
billion. It is the largest public 
university 
endowment 
in 
the country other than the 
flagship universities in Texas, 
which receive oil royalties. It is 
no exaggeration to say that the 
University of Michigan would 
not be the university it is today 
— one of the best and most 
highly ranked universities in 
the world — without generous 
donors and wise and dedicated 
professionals who invest those 
funds to maximize returns for 
the public good.
The 
documented 
facts 
should speak much clearly 
and loudly: the Univeristy 
offers 
free 
tuition 
to 
qualifying in-state students 
from families with incomes 
up to $65,000 a year; the 
University’s 
investment 
performance puts it near the 
top of all endowments; and 
the 
distribution 
from 
the 
University’s endowment has 
increased every year since 
2003.
We are proud of our donors 
and alumni, who have helped 

us raise over $1 billion to 
support our students in this 
campaign alone. Attempting 
to disparage our donors is 
potentially 
destructive 
to 
the culture of philanthropic 
support 
at 
the 
University, 
which is one if its hallmarks. It 
is also hurtful to some of our 
most generous donors, whose 
wisdom 
and 
involvement 
has 
helped 
the 
University 
enormously. We are proud of 
our current Board of Regents 
and 
University 
leaders, 
including the executive vice 
president, 
chief 
financial 
officer and the Investment 
Office staff. Regent Andrea 
Fischer Newman has long 
served 
this 
University 
with 
distinction 
and 
her 
dedication to this institution 
is beyond reproach.
We 
firmly 
believe 
that 
the University of Michigan 
deserves 
better 
treatment 
by one of our state’s leading 
news organizations.
We take great pride in 
the success of our beloved 
institution and the positive 
impact it makes in the lives of 
the people in our state.

AMANDA ZHANG | COLUMN

We need to talk about sexism in tennis
L

et me be the first to say 
Serena 
Williams 
is 
an 
inspiration by every metric. 
As an African-American woman, a 
mother and a 23-time Grand Slam 
champion, she is living proof that 
women can exude both power and 
grace and that adversity is no match 
for resilience. However, in regards 
to her recent controversial match at 
the US Open, Williams is fighting the 
wrong fight.
For those unfamiliar with the 
situation, Williams lost to first time 
Grand Slam Champion Naomi Osaka 
in the US Open women’s final after 
the umpire, Carlos Ramos, made 
three calls against her that proved 
incredibly 
consequential 
to 
the 
match’s outcome. In the center of the 
controversy is her third code violation 
for “verbal abuse,” which she earned 
by calling Ramos a “liar” and a “thief.” 
As per the official US Open rules, 
Williams received a game penalty, 
which not only resulted in a $17,000 
fine, but also shifted the match 
drastically in Osaka’s favor.
Following the penalty, Williams, 
in tears, asserted that male tennis 
players “who do a lot worse” do not 
receive such harsh punishments. Her 
comments have sparked a massive 
debate 
online 
with 
prominent 
members of the tennis community 
such as Novak Djokovic and Billie 
Jean King weighing in and people 
from all walks of life offering their 
support and criticism.
The truth is both Ramos and 
Williams are to blame for the 
controversy that overshadowed a 
historic US Open final. Williams lost 
her temper in a moment when she 
needed it most, and Ramos neglected 
to consider the gravity of his calls in 
such a high stakes match. That being 
said, Williams’ point still has validity. 
Regardless of her actions at the US 

Open, the onslaught of backlash 
against Williams is proof that sexism 
in tennis is a real problem.
Following 
the 
controversy, 
the Herald Sun released a cartoon 
depicting a monstrous Williams 
furiously stomping on her racket. 
The cartoon is a blatantly offensive 
illustration 
that 
perpetuates 
degrading 
stereotypes 
of 
black 
women, and while it has been met 
with considerable backlash, it is far 
from the first time Williams has dealt 
with sexism and racism in her career.
Williams has long been associated 
with derogatory terms like “gorilla,” 
“manly” and “savage” by both the 
public and sports commentators. 
This is not a problem white men face. 
We let the athlete entertain us with 
her amazing power and dynamism 
on the court and then criticize her for 
developing the body and grit to do so. 
Williams can hit serves that exceed 
120 miles per hour, so why are we 
expecting her to have anything less 
than than a muscular build?
Williams has also faced her 
fair share of adversity on the court. 
Even as a 23-time Grand Slam 
champion, a four-time Olympic gold 
medalist and No. 1 ranked tennis 
player for 186 consecutive weeks, her 
accomplishments are still trivialized 
compared to those of men. After a 14 
month maternity leave, prior to which 
she held a No. 1 ranking, Williams 
was not welcomed back to the tennis 
world with open arms and praise but 
instead knocked down to No. 453 
and offered an unseeded position at 
the French Open. To make matters 
worse, Williams’ eye-catching and 
empowering black catsuit, which she 
wore to her first match, was promptly 
banned from the tournament.
The fact that taking time off 
to have a child resulted in such 
a significant blow to her athletic 

standing is sexist. The fact that her 
choice of clothing was a conflict at 
a tournament designed to measure 
physical ability is sexist. Williams is 
an unparalleled athletic force, and she 
has no shortage of accolades to prove 
it, yet her femininity proves to be a 
constant barrier to her success. Time 
and time again, the athlete has battled 
opposition her male counterparts 
have never once seen.
Williams may be the most 
well-known victim of sexism is 
professional tennis but she is far 
from an anomaly. Archaic double 
standards hurt all women in the 
sport one way or another. Whether 
it is through a code violation for a 
quick on-court shirt change as in 
the case of Alize Cornet or being 
asked to “twirl” after a sweeping 
Australian Open victory as in the 
case of Eugenie Bouchard, sexism in 
tennis is a double-edged sword -- it 
hinders women’s ability to achieve 
success and diminishes its value 
when they do.
The 
Williams-Ramos 
controversy was an unfortunate 
conflict in which neither party was 
completely innocent, but Williams 
is not wrong to point out the flagrant 
injustices against women in the 
sport. At the end of the day, tennis is 
a game of physical prowess and fine-
tuned skill. Players like Williams, 
Cornet and Bouchard have invested 
thousands of hours of practice into 
their sport and have developed 
athletic capabilities the rest of us 
could not even dream of. It is time we 
let those hard earned capabilities be 
the sole determining factor in their 
failures and successes. It is time we 
recognize these women as athletes 
first.

I always wanted to be Mac 

Miller.

He was effortlessly cool, his 

cockiness somehow charming 
through 
his 
willingness 
to 

be 
publicly 
imperfect. 
His 

music 
was 
easy-going 
and 

kind, an impression confirmed 
repeatedly by those who knew 
him personally. He possessed 
sensitive 
indie 
proclivities 

(e.g. the “Nikes On My Feet” 
video opens with a snippet 
of 
“Wordless 
Chorus,” 
his 

sampling of Sufjan Stevens, his 
covers of “Lua” and “First Day 
of My Life,” etc). He started as 
a fun kid and developed into a 

thoughtful and clever lyricist 
with a penchant for irreverent 
humor 
interspersed 
with 

Hemingway-esque moments of 
incisive candor. He was always 
rhythmically innovative and 
musically-minded. His music 
soundtracked my high school 
experience and, to a certain 
degree, my college experience 
so far. He felt like an old friend.

Remembering Mac Miller

JONAH MENDELSON

Daily Arts Writer

SONY PICTURES

Mac Miller died alone at his 

home on Sept. 7, 2018, of an 
apparent drug overdose.

I’ve spent the last two weeks 

listening 
almost 
exclusively 

to Mac’s music, and the main 
message I’ve taken away from it 
is that hindsight is 20 / 20. His 
most recent works in particular 
are foreboding: What could 
be brushed off before as an 
exercise in depression as a 
lyrical theme now feel like 
obvious foreshadowing. Take 
“Rain”: “Sober I can’t deal, I’m 

in the corner with my head low 
/ Runnin’ from my shadow, 
never ending chase / Ease 
the pain and the battle that’s 
within me / Sniff the same shit 
that got Whitney, the high heel 
depression / My temple feel 
the metal comin’ out the Smith 
& Wesson, bang / Say a prayer, 
leave my brains on the tile floor,” 
or “Perfect Circle/Godspeed”: 
“They don’t want me to OD and 
have to talk to my mother / Tell 
her they could have done more 
to help me / And she’d be crying 
saying that she’d do anything 
to have me back.” The tracks 
that hit the hardest, however, 
are from the K.I.D.S era, a time 
when Mac seemed so carefree 
and lighthearted. “Nikes On 
My 
Feet,” 
“Knock 
Knock,” 

“Kool Aid and Frozen Pizza” 
and many others now serve as 
morbid reminders that the good 
times don’t always last.

Since his death I’ve been 

asking 
myself 
the 
same 

question: What is it about Mac 
Miller’s music that makes his 
loss such a devastating blow? I 
think it’s that he always seemed 
triumphant 
in 
some 
way; 

even when he was candidly 
discussing his demons, it always 
felt somehow inevitable that 
he would overcome them. For 
him to succumb so tragically 
is a grim message. If Mac, a 
guy with so much going for 
him, can’t beat his own human 
failings, who among us can? He 
always stressed that he was a 
normal guy, especially in his 
early tracks like “Kool Aid and 
Frozen Pizza”: “I live a life 
pretty similar to yours / Used to 
go to school, hang with friends 

and play sports.” What was once 
an inspiring message now turns 
bleak.

The title of “So It Goes,” the 

final track off Mac’s final album, 
Swimming, is a reference to Kurt 
Vonnegut’s 
“Slaughterhouse-

Five,” in which the phrase 
“so it goes” is repeatedly used 
when someone dies. For this to 
be the title of Mac’s final track 
is unfortunately fitting. Mac’s 
final Instagram story, posted 
hours before he was found dead, 
was the outro to “So It Goes.” 
His final tweet, later deleted, 
was “The end of So It Goes is 
so beautiful man. I told Jon 
Brion to play the ascension into 
heaven and he nailed it.”

The phrase “so it goes” is often 

misinterpreted as an expression 
of passive acceptance, a shrug of 
the shoulders. To the contrary, 
Vonnegut used that phrase 
to convey the way in which 
words are often not capable of 
expressing the raw tragedy of 
death. Instead, the reality of the 
situation is numbed through 
cliché fatalism. The repetition 
of the phrase draws attention 
to how much pain is buried 
beneath stoicism. It is not a 
positive message.

Mac’s death is not poetic, 

it is sad and meaningless and 
real. He once said “I’d rather 
be the corny white rapper than 
the 
drugged-out 
mess 
who 

can’t even get out of his house. 
Overdosing is just not cool. 
You don’t go down in history 
because you overdose. You just 
die.”

So it goes.
Rest in peace, Easy Mac with 

the cheesy raps. 

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

A man with a mask shaped 

like a crow’s head met us when 
we arrived at the scream park, 
lugging our sleeping 
bags, 

fresh off the golf cart that had 
brought us from our car. I’d 
already quietly predicted that 
the golf cart might unironically 
be the most fun part of the 
night 
for 
me, 
and 
when 

the 
crow-man 
approached, 

wielding a staff and peering 
inscrutably at us down a sharp 
red beak, I froze. He was the 
first “monster” we’d met.

“You guys signed the waiver, 

right?” he asked us.

Oh 
God! 
I 
thought. 

Somebody nodded yes.

“Good! That means I get to 

hug you!”

He enveloped two of us 

in a hug. I wasn’t sure how 
to react. Was it meant to be 
friendly? Uncomfortable? He 
kept hugging us for a minute 
although we didn’t really hug 
him back. Uncomfortable must 
have been the goal.

When my friend pitched 

us the idea — one night of 
“horror 
camping” 
at 
the 

Scarefest Scream Park in New 
Haven, Mich., where we were 
guaranteed to be terrorized 
for 13 hours straight at a 
campground in the woods — I 
thought she was joking. Every 
step of the process was twofold 
for me: Not quite wanting to 
go while still agreeing, pulling 
up thrilled to see the festive 
searchlights and torch-rimmed 
park 
while 
simultaneously 

yearning to backtrack and 
find an Airbnb somewhere. 
We really are those idiots, I 
kept thinking. Signing up and 
paying money to get terrorized 
for a night, waltzing into a 
forest where we know we’ll get 
attacked, joking about it.

All of it was like that: 

excitement 
virtually 

indistinguishable from dread.

I’ve been thinking about this 

line a lot lately. In the spirit of 
fall (and of my whole horror-
obsessed 
self), 
I’m 
taking 

an English class focused on 
popular horror, and last week 
we talked about why anyone 
would ever enjoy something 
that’s 
specifically 
designed 

to disturb or frighten them. 
I tried recalling some of the 
theories to my friend while we 
waited in line for the haunted 
hayride (the least terrifying 
attraction by far, and the one 
we both felt most equipped 
for), but could only remember 

a few. There was the idea that 
horror engages our curiosity 
and fascination, the notions 
of being thrilled or vindicated 
by empathizing with either 
the attacked or the attacker, 
and 
the 
gender-normative 

“snuggle theory,” which my 
class seemed to unanimously 
decide was the strangest.

As the night wore on, we 

noticed a lot of recurring 
characters. 
There 
was 
the 

young man with a face caked 
in skeletal grey makeup, who 
seemed to dislike all four of us 
in a fair, controlled sort of way. 
There was the nun in the terror 
maze whom we later saw in 
the late-night scavenger hunt 
who was dressed scarily but 
who actually gave us helpful 
advice whenever we talked to 
her. In the scavenger hunt we 
met a boy covered in makeup 
who had us do the “Thriller” 
dance in exchange for a clue. 
The crow-man’s presence was 
woven in and out of our night; 
every couple of hours we’d 
cross paths with him again, 
ask each other how the night 
was going. He was a benign 
presence. Oh, good, I started to 
think, after the second or third 
encounter. It’s our friend the 
crow-man again.

By 3:00 a.m. or so, toward the 

end of the scavenger hunt, I’d 
begun noticing a thread: The 
horror of the night was tied 
inextricably in with comedy. 
Even now I can’t completely 
figure out why — there’s no 
simple reason, and it’s not like 
the event was marketed as 
comedy, or as anything other 
than strictly horror. But we 
were very open to laughing, 
the same way we were open to 
being scared. Maybe it was the 
same door inside of us that was 
open to both of them. It was 
weirdly freeing. The monsters 
made fun of us when we made 
missteps or took wrong turns, 

and we made fun of ourselves, 
too. That giddy feeling you get 
when you’re nervous stuck 
with us all night, making us 
giggle probably more often 
than we jumped and screamed.

For all the giddiness I 

mentioned before, it was still 
unquestionably 
scary; 
the 

two were linked. I clutched 
my friends and held hands 
with them. We were a team, 
the Dream Scream Team as 
one of them had labeled our 
group chat beforehand. We 
jumped at fake gunfire, tensed 
at chainsaws and flinched 
when monsters crept up on 
us. A couple of times I started 
shaking 
and 
couldn’t 
will 

my body to stop, which was 
frustrating, but really more 
mystifying than anything.

I’ve 
always 
loved 
scary 

stories. I think horror is a 
rich and fascinating subset 
of literature, and of culture 
in general. One of my friend’s 
persuasions for why we should 
go camping was, “It’ll be like 
being in a scary movie for a 
night!” Which sounds horrible, 
sure, but also kind of awesome, 
right?

Who hasn’t sat in a group 

of their friends, debating the 
order in which they’d be picked 
off in a horror movie? Who 
hasn’t watched “Halloween” 
or 
read 
“The 
Shining”and 

thought, What would I do if 
that were me? They’re hero 
stories, and everyone wants 
to think they’d be brave, but 
there’s no way to know unless 
you’re there. Maybe you want 
to be Sidney Prescott or maybe 
you want to be Carrie, or maybe 
you want to be both, either, 
just as long as the night ends 
with you covered in blood, as 
long as you’ve changed, you’ve 
emerged the real you, you’ve 
gone through something.

I was afraid that “living 

through” a scary story wouldn’t 
be as much fun for me as 
reading or watching one from 
outside. It would be too much 
for me, I wouldn’t be able to 
take it. To be sure, there were 
parts of the night I opted out 
of; our experience could have 
been much more extreme. But 
overall, I had a terrific time. 
It felt liberating, exhilarating. 
Everything was elaborately, 
enthrallingly ridiculous. So a 
clown is running after us with 
a chainsaw? Whatever, we 
paid for this, didn’t we? The 
scary crow-man? Yeah, he’s 

Living inside a horror 

story, for the night

Summer Reading: Sedaris 
and a new way of thinking

I have a theory: For every 

person there is one book that 
changes everything, a novel or 
memoir or poetry collection 
that blows their world wide 
open. One book to which 
we can point and be able to 
say, “After that everything 
was different.” For me that 
book is David Sedaris’s 2017 
collection, “Theft by Finding: 
Diaries (1977-2002).”

Good books give us fresh 

perspectives, new ways of 
understanding 
the 
world’s 

contradictions 
and 
entire 

languages through which to 
filter them. The best books, 
though, are the ones that 
change not just how we speak 
and think about the world 
but what of our lives we deem 
worthy of critical attention.

I began “Theft by Finding” 

on a muggy July afternoon this 
summer. It was a two-week 
loan from the Boston Public 
Library, with a faded green 
clover sticker on the spine 
indicating it was from the new 
books section. I’d never read 
any of Sedaris’s other works. I 
picked it up on a whim because 
I liked the cover art — big red 
block letters in a pleasing font.

My 
lack 
of 
purpose 
or 

expectation made it especially 
thrilling to have found this 
book, a manifestation of the 
kind 
of 
life-altering 
luck 

that one imagines but rarely 
experiences 
in 
such 
vivid 

clarity. “Theft by Finding” 
is something very special, 
perhaps 
because 
Sedaris 

himself is so extraordinary.

It’s not his fame that makes 

the 
book 
so 
remarkable, 

but instead his dedication 
to seeing the world as it is; 
ridiculous, pain-filled, joyful, 
incomprehensibly 
bizarre. 

“Half the people I know have 
dead animals in their freezers: 

reptiles, birds, mammals. Is 
that normal?” Sedaris ponders. 
Or: “Today the teacher told us 
that a ripe Camembert should 
have the same consistency as 
a human eyebrow.” His dutiful 
recordings of strangers are just 
as engaging: “Man ordering at 
Butera’s 
deli/prepared-foods 

counter: “Hey, give me one 

of them chickens that spins 
around.”

Sedaris’s sharp sense of 

irony 
anchors 
the 
entries, 

whose subjects range from 
his career as a professional 
mover 
to 
the 
emotional 

aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. 
He is constantly ready for a 
tender takedown of nearly 
everything. “While listening 
to a country music station, we 
heard a talk / song narrated 
by our flag,” Sedaris writes. 
“I flew proudly at Iwo Jima 
and the blustering deserts of 
Kuwait, anywhere freedom is 
threatened, you will find me.”

Even his literary success 

is 
addressed 
with 
this 

keen, sincere logic of life’s 
incongruity. “Roger Donald 
called from Little Brown to say 
that he would like to negotiate 
a 
two-book 
deal,” 
Sedaris 

says. “To celebrate, I bought 
a denim shirt, and thought it 
amazing how quickly one’s life 
can change. I never thought I’d 
want a denim shirt.”

I 
am 
enthralled 
with 

Sedaris’s eye for the strange, 
and for how he manages to 
juxtapose his own trials with 
the oddities he comes across. 
“Today I saw a one-armed 
dwarf carrying a skateboard. 
It’s been ninety days since 
I’ve had a drink,” he writes. 
Nothing gets a pass; the whole 
lot of life is presented raw, 
spread-eagle for his dutiful 
examination. 
After 
reading 

“Theft 
by 
Finding,” 
the 

world seems that way to me, 
too: 
unimaginably 
strange, 

teeming with things to notice 
and write about.

It is all here. It always was. I 

just had to look.

BOOKS NOTEBOOK

our friend. At one point in the 
terror maze I urged my friend 
forward, 
saying 
something 

along the lines of, “What are 
you afraid of? Getting scared? 
That’s going to happen no 
matter which way we go,” and I 
felt an immediate small rush of 
pride. Even this one moment of 
impatient rationality made me 
feel very smart and competent, 
in control, like maybe I didn’t 
need to be so terrified all the 
time — maybe it was up to me.

The 
next 
morning, 
we 

wandered dull-eyed out of our 

tent, working on an hour or two 
of sleep. The concessions tent 
was doling out a sugar-heavy 
complimentary breakfast, and 
while we sipped our orange 
juice and ate our doughnut 
holes, we surveyed the scene 
that had so terrified us only 
hours before. The turnaround 
of the hayride was dusty and 
flat; the haunted castle was 
clear-edged in the pale dawn, 
no longer a threatening cave 
of shadows. Already I felt a 
little nostalgic as we finished 
our breakfast, said goodbye to 

the crow-man while we packed 
up our rental tent. It was a 
clear morning and everyone 
was happy (we survived!) yet I 
already missed the thrill of the 
night before. I missed the story: 
the constant expectation, the 
emotion, the question of which 
characters we could trust.

Yet I still felt giddy. We left 

the campsite still marveling 
about how different it looked, 
about how bizarre it was to 
see all of this left over in the 
daytime. It’s a wonder what a 
little darkness can do.

I have a theory: 

For every 

person there 
is one book 
that changes 
everything, a 

novel or memoir 

or poetry 

collection that 

blows their 
world wide 

open.

I will not atone: All the 
things I’m not sorry for

DAILY COMEDY COLUMN

Today 
is 
Yom 
Kippur. 

The 
international 
day 
of 

Jewish repentance. A day of 
reflection, atonement and not 
eating. A day to look back on 
the year and contemplate one’s 
sins, failures and mistakes. 
Thinking back on the year and 
all of the people I may have 
offended or the minor traffic 
laws I may have violated or the 
shade I may have thrown fills 
me with the guilt of a thousand 
Jewish 
mothers. 
As 
you 

know, dear reader, I’m a self-
conscious, guilt-ridden kind 
of gal, so this time of year isn’t 
very good on my poor nerves. 
Therefore, I’m gonna let you 
know exactly what I will not 
be atoning for this year. Yeah, 
I am sorry for running over 
that man with my bicycle last 
week (he was unharmed, by 
the way), but there is no way in 
hell I’m apologizing for binge-
watching all of “The Fosters” 
on Netflix (Noah Centineo 
stole my heart as replacement 
Jesus long before he was Peter 
Kavinsky, 
thank 
you 
very 

much).

So here is a list of things I 

will not atone for on this holy 
day of atonement:

I will not atone for my 

three identical pairs of white 
sneakers. They may look the 
same, but I am telling you they 
have different places in my 
heart and closet.

I will not atone for trying to 

convince my ophthalmologist 
I needed glasses because I 
wanted to look smart even 
though my vision is perfect.

I will also not atone for 

buying glasses anyway even 
though I do not need them. But 
I do think people take me more 
seriously when I wear them. 
Even though they hurt a bit, I 
still wear them, and for that I 
will also not apologize.

I will not atone for my face 

sweat, back sweat or boob 
sweat. 
I 
have 
over-active 

glands and they perspire, get 
used to it. Most activities, 
including standing, make me 
sweat, so telling me I look 
sweaty is unhelpful and rude. 
But I will not apologize for my 

body, in fact, I am thankful for 
it and all the wonderful things 
it does, like sweat.

I will not atone for ubering 

to Zingerman’s. It is a far walk 
and you know how important 
it is to get there before the 
Sunday crowds roll in.

I will not atone for drinking 

two to three to four cups 
of coffee a day. My caffeine 

addiction is my problem, and I 
don’t think it’s a problem.

I will not atone for my Mrs. 

Maisel impression because it is 
gold.

I will not atone for my 

Russian 
stacking 
doll 

collection. Period.

I will not atone for taking 

that handful of Splenda packets 
from Starbucks. But I actually 
do feel pretty bad about that 
one, so maybe scratch that.

I will not atone for making 

a 
playlist 
titled 
“True 

Happiness” that is just Carly 
Rae 
Jepsen’s 
“Cut 
to 
the 

Feeling” 26 times.

I will not atone for taking 

back the T-shirt I gave to my 
brother as a birthday present. 
Because he left it at home and 
that is simply his fault.

I will not atone for not 

putting my phone on airplane 

mode when I’m on an airplane.

I 
will 
not 
atone 
for 

unironically liking blue grass 
music. It has a twang and a 
soulful beat that fills me with 
joy.

I will not atone for taking 

selfies when I feel good about 
myself. Because, hell, if you 
feel hot, own it.

I will not atone for asking 

that guy out first. #feminism

I will not atone for writing 

this article. #journalism

I 
will 
not 
atone 
for 

my 
unconscious 
brain. 

#surrealism

I will not atone for using 

hashtags. #hashtag

I will not atone for asking 

which 12:00 is a.m. and which 
12:00 is p.m. because it gets 
really confusing.

I 
will 
not 
atone 
for 

re-watching 
“A 
Cinderella 

Story” with Chad Michael 
Murray and Hilary Duff up 
to five times a year, because 
the soundtrack is killer and it 
literally never gets old.

I will not atone for wearing 

hats and claiming it’s for the 
outfit when I actually just 
didn’t wash my hair.

I will not atone for biting my 

nails, though I should probably 
stop doing it because it’s a bad 
habit.

I will not atone for my crush 

on Jeff Goldblum.

I will not atone for my crush 

on Adam Driver.

I will not atone for my crush 

on Pete Davidson.

I will not atone for my crush 

on Johnny Bravo (yes I still 
think about him).

I will not atone for my 

perpetual watch tan.

I will not atone for my love 

of Christmas. Just because I’m 
Jewish doesn’t mean I can’t 
appreciate a good carol and a 
glass of eggnog.

I will not atone for watching 

drag queen makeup tutorials 
on Facebook.

I will not atone for wearing 

pajamas to class, because who 
doesn’t.

There you have it folks, 

a 
year’s 
worth 
of 
guilty 

pleasures, sinful indulgences 
and hedonistic tendencies that 
I refuse to apologize for. In the 
wise words of Demi Lovato, 
“I’m sorry (I’m not sorry).”

BECKY PORTMAN
Daily Comedy Columnist

I’m a self-

conscious, guilt-
ridden kind of 
gal, so this time 
of year isn’t very 
good on my poor 
nerves. Therefore, 
I’m gonna let you 

know exactly 

what I will not be 
atoning for this 

year. 

Through the judicial system, 

power is granted to a select 
few in hopes that they will 
uphold the law and use their 
authority to protect and defend 
the greater good. This ideal, 
however, often doesn’t translate 
to reality. Countless instances 
of oppression and wrongdoing 
throughout human history have 
proved that power corrupts 
and often yields injustice. “On 
My Skin” brings to light the 
true story of Italian young man 
Stefano 
Cucchi, 
(Alessandro 

Borghi “Don’t Be Bad”) who 
was arrested on minor drug 
charges 
and 
shockingly 

died in prison a week later. 
Though Netflix’s adaptation of 
Cucchi’s harrowing tale tells an 
important story, cinematically 
there are more than a few 
shortcomings. 

The day of Stefano Cucchi’s 

arrest begins like any other. 
He transitions from a morning 
workout, to work as a surveyor 
at a construction site, to a 
religious service, to sharing 
a meal with his parents, to 
finally meeting up with a friend 
for a casual smoke. This day 
of 
normalcy 
is 
interrupted, 

however, when a pair of arrogant 
policemen 
approach 
Cucchi 

with suspicions that he has been 
smoking and dealing marijuana. 
A few minutes of back and forth 
interrogation ensues, leading to 
the police’s eventual discovery 
of a hefty bag of pot in Cucchi’s 
pant leg. Detained overnight, 
Cucchi endures a brutal and 
illicit beating from his arresting 

officers, leaving his face black 
and blue and two vertebrae 
in his back broken. Shortly 
after, Cucchi is sentenced to 
imprisonment for the dealing 
and 
possession 
of 
cocaine 

and marijuana. Following his 
sentencing, Cucchi’s life begins 

a continuous downward spiral 
and it gradually becomes clear 
that, within the grasp of the 
prison system, he will never 
walk free again. 

“On My Skin” manages to 

stray from creating archetype 
characters. 
Director 
Alessio 

Cremonini portrays Cucchi as a 
multidimensional 
protagonist, 

allowing audiences to perceive 
him as human and not entirely 
innocent or guilty. On the one 
hand, all signs point to the fact 
that Cucchi was “a bad man” for 
dealing cocaine and marijuana. 
However, at the same time, 
we also receive a glimpse into 
another part of Cucchi, the 
part that is a son and a brother. 
Though brief, the moments that 
reiterate the positive and loving 
relationship that Cucchi has 
with his family, such as regular 
dinners at his parent’s house or 
the sibling banter shared with 
his sister, build his character’s 
complexity and realness. 

Though “On My Skin” is 

commendable in its introduction 
of Cucchi’s story to a broader 
audience, 
it 
lacks 
enough 

engaging material for audiences 
to grasp onto. The majority of 

the film can be encapsulated as a 
visual representation of Cucchi’s 
slow and painful physical and 
emotional deterioration, which 
is simply not sustainable for a 
two-hour 
film. 
Additionally, 

with such a large portion of the 
movie relying solely on Cucchi, 
there are no sturdy character 
relationships to invest in. Scene 
after scene, Cucchi is depicted 
lying in bed in worse condition 
than the day before, which 
becomes rather repetitive and, 
frankly, a bit boring. Not to 
mention the dialogue is far 
from riveting. The majority 
of 
conversations 
occurring 

between Cucchi and the prison 
guards or doctors, or between 
Cucchi’s parents, take on somber 
and relatively bland tones.

The film’s greatest misstep 

is failing to delve deeper into 
the 
aftermath 
of 
Cucchi’s 

death. 
Stefano 
Cucchi 
was 

unfortunately 
not 
alone 
in 

the cruelty he endured at the 
hands of the judicial system. 
The credit sequence reveals 
the staggering fact that Stefano 
Cucchi was the 148th person to 
die in an Italian prison in 2009. 
Additionally, audiences learn 
that after his death, Cucchi’s 
sister Ilaria and parents began 
digging 
for 
answers 
about 

Stefano’s bizarre death. This 
brief fragment, suggests that 
Cucchi’s story may be better 
off told as a documentation of 
his family’s search for answers. 
With 
uninvolved 
character 

interactions and a depressing 
downtempo 
mood, 
“On 
My 

Skin” simply does not have the 
lifeblood to invest audiences 
in what in reality is a very 
compelling and gripping story.

FILM REVIEW

SMTD Symphony Orchestra will 
honor Bilik & Bernstein in opening 

Having 
recently 
returned 

from a spell as a guest conductor 
in Innsbruck, Austria, Director 
of Orchestra Kenneth Kiesler 
immediately 
resumed 
his 

work in conducting world-
class musicians as he prepares 
for the University Symphony 
Orchestra’s first performance 
of the 2018 — 2019 term.

The School of Music, Theatre 

& Dance (SMTD) University 
Symphony Orchestra is the 
most 
experienced 
orchestra 

at the University. Composed 
of 73 undergraduate students 
and 
35 
graduate 
students, 

the 
University 
Symphony 

Orchestra 
is 
consistently 

ranked 
one 
of 
the 
top 

university orchestras in the 
United States, having been 
awarded a Grammy for Best 
Classical Recording in 2004 
and nominated for the Grammy 
on two other occasions.

The 
SMTD 
University 

Symphony Orchestra will be 
performing three pieces: the 
“Violin Concerto” by Benjamin 
Britten, performed by SMTD 
Concerto Competition winner 
Christine Harada Li, Elgar’s 

most famous piece, “Enigma 
Variations” and the encore: 
Jerry Bilik’s arrangement of 
“Hail to the Victors.”

Kenneth Kiesler has been 

at 
the 
University 
for 
23 

years and is currently the 
Director 
of 
Orchestras 
at 

the University. As such, his 
responsibilities 
include 
the 

supervision of the conductors 
of the other orchestras at 
SMTD, handling programming 
and 
scheduling 
for 
each 

orchestra 
and 
conducting 

the 
renowned 
University 

Symphony Orchestra. Kiesler’s 
work is significant in both 

physical demand and musical 
payoff. Although he often finds 
himself burning the midnight 
oil, 
Kiesler 
has 
led 
his 

colleagues and students to be 
ranked by U.S. News and World 
Report 
as 
constituting 
the 

number-one graduate program 
in conducting every year since 
1997. In short, the conductor is 
well-versed in the intricacies 
of Mich.’s orchestras and a 
celebrity in his field.

The 
encore 
piece 
being 

the focus of the University 
Symphony Orchestra’s opening 
performance 
for 
the 
term, 

Kiesler 
wanted 
to 
honor 

Bilik and Bernstein for their 
contributions to the University 
and to American conductors.

“Usually 
encores 
are 
a 

surprise, 
but 
this 
is 
very 

cool, so I don’t want it to 
be a surprise,” Kiesler said 
in an interview with The 
Daily. “Jerry Bilik is the guy 
who has written over 1000 
arrangements for the Michigan 
Marching Band for football. 
In 1967, he wrote variations 
on ‘Hail to the Victors’ for the 
New York Philharmonic and 
Leonard Bernstein. Bernstein 
conducted 
the 
New 
York 

Philharmonic in the premier 
here at Hill Auditorium in 1967. 
It has never been played since.”

Kiesler 
has 
long 
been 

a 
follower 
of 
Leonard 

Bernstein’s.

“I grew up in the New York 

area, in the suburbs of New 
York city, so I grew up going to 
his concerts, and he spoke at 
my graduation for grad school, 
too. I conducted the orchestra 
at my graduation with Leonard 
Bernstein staring at me,” the 
conductor 
recounted. 
“It’s 

neat for me. I’m certainly no 
personal friend of Bernstein’s 
but I met him and was with 
him three times and I feel a 
huge debt of gratitude to him 
because he opened the doors 
for American conductors.”

The University Symphony 

Orchestra is well-equipped and 
ready to fulfill this debt to the 
late Leonard Bernstein with 
the group’s first performance 
of the season next Saturday.

After 
a 
51-year 
slumber, 

Bernstein’s 
performance 
of 

Bilik’s arrangement of “Hail to 
the Victors” will ring through 
Hill Auditorium once again, 
revived by the University’s 
finest musicians. There will 
be a pre-concert lecture at 7:15 
p.m. in the lower lobby of Hill 
Auditorium to be followed by 
the main performance at 8:00 
p.m. Entry to the performance 
is free of charge.

Paye striking balance between present and future

Kwity Paye recognized the 
trickery right away. He wasn’t 
fooled.
Southern 
Methodist’s 
offensive 
line 
stood 
still, 
hoping 
to 
confuse 
the 
Michigan defensive line so the 
Mustangs could get a quick 
play off.
Paye 
was 
undeterred, 
turning the corner with his 
elite speed on full display as 
the quarterback rolled to the 
other side. He approached the 
quarterback, and in practice 
— where his reps largely take 
place these days — that’s where 
the play would have stopped.
“Can’t touch the quarterback 
in practice,” Paye said through 
a laugh Tuesday. “No, sir.”
But this was a game, and 
Paye was giving no mercy.
“I saw that he was trying to 
get a quick play off,” he said. 
“So I just sprinted over there 
and then I saw he still had the 
ball and just took my shot.”
Take 
his 
shot, 
he 
did, 
sending 
the 
quarterback’s 
helmet flying and putting fans 
on notice for things to come.
The sophomore defensive 
end is stuck in limbo right 
now, groomed as a successor 
at one of the defensive end 
spots. For now, he sits behind 
stalwarts Chase 
Winovich 
and 
Rashan 
Gary, 
operating 
at 
both the “end” 
side 
and 
the 
“anchor.” Each 
has its requisite 
skillsets. 
For 
now, 
Paye 
is 
walking 
that 
tightrope.
“The anchor 
side is more of a hard-nosed 
position,” Paye said. “That’s 
like the base of the defense. 

So if the anchor is weak, the 
whole 
defense 
falls 
apart. 
You have to be strong at the 
position, knock the tight end 
back, just be physical. At the 
end position, I feel like that’s 
more the pass-rushing side — 
able to finesse and chase after 
that quarterback.”
In high school, he played 
the “end” spot, where he was 
known best for his athleticism 
and pass-rush ability. Paye has 
since added about 25 pounds, 
which allows him to spell Gary 
at anchor as well.
Defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 
Mattison’s 
system 
is predicated on plenty of 
rotation, often dictated by the 
players themselves. But with 
All-American-level 
players 
operating each end, there’s 
hardly room for anyone else to 
take on an extended role.
Paye would be next in that 
pecking order — he will be 
next in that pecking order, be 
it this year or next. It’s hardly 
a knock on him that his playing 
time is limited by Winovich 
and Gary.
In fact, he’s using their 
presence to pick up morsels 
from their games.
From Gary, Paye is hoping to 
absorb resilience.
“I don’t think I’ve ever 
seen him miss practice,” Paye 
said. “Even when he’s injured, 
he’s out there 
practicing. That 
just 
motivates 
me 
to 
fight 
through injury 
and 
go 
out 
there.”
From 
Winovich, 
it’s 
his 
relentlessness.
“When 
you 
see Chase play, 
there will be a quarterback 
that will take off down the 
other sideline, you see Chase 

hunting him down,” he said. 
“Just seeing him play with 
that 
much 
enthusiasm, 
that 
much 
effort, 
makes 
me want to play 
that same way.” 
Paye 
has 
been 
working 
with 
Tenarius 
“Tank” Wright 
— 
a 
former 
defensive end at 
Arkansas, 
who 
is on Michigan’s strength staff 
right now — to help develop 
pass-rush tools and proper 

usage of his hands.
At the moment, it’s about 
finding balance 
as 
he 
juggles 
what’s 
needed 
now and what 
will be needed 
in the future. 
He has to be 
ready 
to 
play 
this 
year, 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
injury 
or 
any 
other 
circumstance. 
For next year, he needs to be 
as best prepared to step in 
(likely for Winovich at “end” 

side) and produce. There will 
be boatloads of production to 
replace.
Paye 
admits 
it’s been hard, 
that next year 
will be easier 
for 
him. 
He’s 
taking 
reps 
at 
both 
sides, 
sometimes 
to 
the 
detriment 
of the long-term 
outlook.
“I 
think 
(Mattison) knows those guys 
are getting ready to leave,” 
Paye said of his outlook on 

the future. “So I feel like he’s 
trying to prepare me to try and 
eventually take 
over, eventually 
fill 
those 
spots. But as of 
right now, I’m 
just 
trying 
to 
contribute.”
Often, that’s 
on display more 
in practice than 
in the games. 
But 
rest 
assured, 
when 
Paye gets his look — just as 
he did against SMU — he’ll be 
ready.

MAX MARCOVITCH
Daily Sports Editor

Sophomore defensive end Kwity Paye finally had the opportunity to take his shot during Saturday’s game with SMU.

“Can’t touch 
the quarterback 
in practice. No, 
sir.”

“The anchor 
side is more of 
a hard-nosed 
position.”

“But as of 
right now, I’m 
just trying to 
contribute.”

Patterson has “never been this comfortable”

It’s clear that Shea Patterson 
is feeling good these days.
All you have to do to know 
that is ask the sophomore 
quarterback’s teammates.
After the Wolverines beat 
Western Michigan two weeks 
ago, 
senior 
defensive 
end 
Chase Winovich talked about 
Patterson’s demeanor.
“The thing about Shea is 
that he just has such a sense 
of confidence that doesn’t 
come off as cocky, but you just 
know and he knows — this 
is my opinion about it — that 
he’s the man,” Winovich said 
last week. “He’s the man for 
the job, and he can get the job 
done.”
On Tuesday, Patterson took 
his turn with the media, but 
not before sophomore fullback 
Ben Mason spoke. And while he 
answered questions, Patterson 
poked his head up over the 
railing in Schembechler Hall 
to watch Mason.
“I mean, you just saw it,” 
Mason said, pointing up to 
where Patterson was peaking 
over the wall. “Everybody on 
the team likes him.”
If 
 
Patterson 
played 
any 
other 
position, 
these 
descriptions 
wouldn’t 
be 
valued 
at 
all. 
But he doesn’t. 
He’s the brand 
new, 
transfer 
quarterback at 
Michigan, 
and 
he’s under the 
microscope that 
accompanies 
that 
position. 
So people care 
that 
he 
has 
acclimated 
quickly to the team and feels 
comfortable.
Last week, Patterson got 
the chance to respond to 
Wolverines fans who were 
panicking after the Week 1 loss 
to Notre Dame.
Patterson 
said 
to 
relax. 
It’s not that he wants fans to 
pipe down completely, just 
that it’s a long season, and not 
everything goes perfectly.

“I understand the tradition 
and expectations that surround 
this program, and that’s what 
it is,” Patterson said. “It’s the 
University of Michigan. I’m 
proud to just be here and be 
a part of the team. Just when 
I say that, it’s understanding 
that 
nobody’s 
expectations 
are bigger than our own here 
in this football office. So we’re 
just 
going 
to 
continue to get 
better 
every 
single week.”
When 
it 
comes 
down 
to it, though, 
none 
of 
that 
stuff 
matters 
outside of the 
team. 
What 
does matter is 
the product on 
the field.
That part is much more 
obvious to an outside observer. 
Patterson has completed 70 
percent of his passes, has six 
touchdowns and has given the 
Michigan the kind of dynamic 
playmaker in the passing game 
that they’ve been longing for.
He has called Wolverines 
coach Jim Harbaugh the best 
coach he has ever played 

for. He seems to be grasping 
the concepts of Harbaugh’s 
offensive schemes.
“I think it’s right where 
I needed to be,” Patterson 
said, when asked if he’s ahead 
of schedule. “Just learning, 
learning 
every 
single 
day. 
Learning 
every 
single 
day 
from 
(Harbaugh) 
and 
the 
coaching staff who have been 
around the game 
of football for so 
many years.
“… 
There’s 
nothing 
left 
unsaid or unsure 
about. 
You 
know, 
if 
you 
make a mistake, 
(Harbaugh) 
is 
gonna come talk 
to 
you 
— 
not 
necessarily 
yell 
at you — but tell you, ‘Hey, this 
is what we’re doing. You know, 
this is what I need you to do.’ 
So I think that’s awesome.”
All of this is made especially 
impressive by the fact that 
Patterson is a transfer. It 
was less than a year ago 
when he announced he’d be 
transferring from Mississippi 
to Michigan.
Then there was the whole 

saga of whether Patterson 
would even be eligible to 
play. And yet, after all of that, 
Harbaugh named Patterson 
the 
starting 
quarterback 
before the opener for the first 
time since he’s been the head 
coach.
Maybe that should have 
been a testament to just how 
comfortable 
Patterson 
was, 
and 
how 
quickly he got 
there. If there 
was any doubt 
after that, or 
any doubt after 
Winovich 
espoused 
his 
quarterback’s 
confidence, 
there shouldn’t 
be now.
As Patterson 
began to wrap up his media 
session on Tuesday, he was 
asked if he feels like the best 
quarterback he’s ever been.
“A lot of room to grow, and 
a lot of stuff to learn from 
over the past three weeks,” 
Patterson said. “But as far as 
the comfort level, I’ve never 
been this comfortable than in 
this system and with this team 
and with these coaches.”

Michigan lands five-
star safety Daxton Hill

Five-star 
safety 
Daxton 
Hill, the No. 12 player in the 
class of 2019, according to 
247Sports, 
announced 
via 
Twitter on Wednesday that he 
is committing to Michigan.
The Tulsa, Okla., product 
is the second 5-star player 
the Wolverines have added to 
their recruiting class, joining 
defensive end Chris Hinton. 
Hill, 
with 
a 
247Sports 
ranking 
of 
.9946, 
is 
the 
highest-
rated 
recruit 
Michigan 
has pulled in 
since 
junior 
defensive 
end 
Rashan 
Gary 
committed 
in 
2016.
Hill stands at 6-foot, 186 
pounds and possesses top-of-
the-line speed, as he recorded 
a 4.3-second 40-yard dash. He 
finished last season, his junior 
year, at Booker T. Washington 
High School, with 71 tackles, 
five interceptions and four 

touchdowns. 
“I thank all the universities 
for recruiting me and taking 
time to invest in me,” Hill said 
in his tweet. “With that being 
said, I will be committing to 
The University of Michigan!!”
The 
commitment 
comes 
mere days after Hill’s visit to 
Ann Arbor for the Wolverines’ 
win over SMU. It is a big 
recruiting win for Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh and his 
staff, since Alabama was a 
favorite to land 
Hill’s services.
The 
Wolverines 
now have three 
safeties in their 
2019 class, as 
Hill joins 3-star 
prospects 
Quinten 
Johnson 
and 
Joey Velazquez, 
though Hill is, 
obviously, the crown jewel of 
that group.
Michigan 
now 
has 
23 
players committed for 2019, 
and Tuesday’s news alone 
moves the class from No. 11 to 
No. 7 nationally, according to 
247Sports.

Wolverines finish sixth at East and West Match Play Challenge

Sunday through Tuesday, the 
Michigan 
women’s 
golf 
team 
hosted its season opener at one 
of the team’s two home courses 
— Radrick Farms Golf Course. At 
times, it appeared the Wolverines 
had the home field advantage.
During Monday’s match play 
round, Michigan was tied with 
Texas A&M with only one group 
still on the course.
Luckily for the Wolverines, 
sophomore Ashley Kim was in 
that final group. Despite trailing 
by one hole with four left to play, 
she notched a par and then three 
consecutive birdies to win her 
match by two holes and help 
Michigan defeat the Aggies, 3-2.
Overall, though, the Wolverines’ 
performance was mediocre and the 
team finished the three-day East 

and West Match Play Challenge 
in sixth place. UC Davis won the 
tournament by default because its 
final round opponent, Iowa State, 
withdrew from the field.
On Sunday, the eight teams 
present competed 
in 36 holes of 
stroke 
play 
to 
determine seeding 
for the ensuing 
match 
play 
tournament. The 
top 
four 
teams 
from stroke play 
qualified 
for 
a 
championship 
bracket while the 
bottom competed 
in a consolation bracket. Each 
round of the match play brackets 
consisted of 18 holes, with the 
semifinals and finals on Monday 
and Tuesday, respectively.
Michigan had a rocky stroke-

play performance. Over the first 
18 holes, the Wolverines’ score of 
301 put them in seventh place, and 
although they made big strides the 
second time around with a score of 
a 290, it wasn’t enough. Michigan 
stayed in seventh 
place.
“We 
kinda 
kicked ourselves 
in 
the 
foot 
a 
little bit in that 
first 
round 
but 
recovered 
very 
nicely,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jan Dowling. “I’d 
say 
ball-striking 
contributed to the 
change.”
Kim’s performance was the 
highlight 
of 
the 
stroke 
play 
competition. She carded scores of 
73 and 72 to tie for eighth place.
“She’s very determined to have 

a great season, and she was ready 
to go in that first tournament,” 
Dowling said. “She took her 
preparation very seriously and 
she’s looking forward to the rest of 
our tournaments.”
Freshmen 
Ashley Lau and 
junior 
Alisa 
Snyder had stellar 
second 
round 
scores of 71 and 
72. They finished 
stroke 
play 
in 
17th 
and 
23rd, 
accordingly, 
and 
their 
success 
sparked 
the 
Wolverines’ 
11-shot 
improvement 
between 
rounds. 
Freshman 
Sophia 
Trombetta and senior Elodie Van 
Dievoet, also in the lineup, placed 
in 31st and 40th respectively.
After defeating Texas A&M, 

Michigan 
faced 
Oregon 
on 
Tuesday. But the Ducks proved 
too much to handle, and the 
Wolverines fell, 4.5-0.5. Though 
Van Dievoet tied her match, her 
teammates all lost their respective 
matches.
“We 
played 
well, they played 
well, 
but 
they 
definitely 
played 
better 
than 
us,” 
Dowling 
said. “Plenty of 
positives to take 
away 
from 
our 
week.”
Junior Hannah 
Ghelfi 
and 
freshman Jacqueline Young also 
competed, but as individuals. They 
placed 28th and 46th among all 
competitors, and Ghelfi finished 
as runner-up in the individual 
bracket.

Regardless of the outcome, the 
Wolverines were glad to get match 
play practice, especially since the 
National Championship consists of 
a match play tournament.
“It’s important to get that 
experience,” Dowling said. “We 
don’t play match play all year. … It 
can get you in this great one-shot-
at-a-time mentality, and it requires 
some experience. … It creates a lot 
of great team camaraderie.”
Additionally, while many sports 
enjoy frequent home play, golf is an 
exception. Thus, hosting a home 
tournament was a memorable 
occasion for Michigan.

The nativist next door


I 

know I am not supposed to say 
this, but most of the books I have 
bought recently have not been 

finished. My nightstand has become a 
graveyard for abandoned literature.

I read a few chapters of “The 

Idiot” because I fell in love with the 
millennial pink jacket cover. After 
watching Amy Cuddy’s TED Talk I 
found myself downloading her book 
“Presence.” And I even tried reading 
“An 
American 
Marriage” 
because 

Oprah Winfrey said I should.

This 
consumerist 
flaw 
revealed 

itself earlier this summer when I found 
myself impulsively adding books to my 
Amazon shopping cart. I think I felt 
like I was missing some important 
knowledge about the world and the 
only way to make up for this was to 
start reading. Perhaps it had something 
to do with the fact that you really only 
have two options when you spend 
money on Amazon. You can either be 
practical and stock up on shampoo or 
mechanical pencils or you can indulge 
and buy things you really don’t need. I 
chose the latter. Two days later a box 
of 10 books arrived at my front door.

The moment I broke the seal of 

Amazon Prime packing tape, I felt the 
weight of the books drop in my stomach. 
I had betrayed bookkeeper Kathleen 
Kelly and the local Shop Around the 
Corner. I had bought from the breed 
of corporate giant Nora Ephron had 
specifically warned us against — à la 
Fox Books. I had given into the allure 
of discount pricing, two-day shipping 
and the comfort of shopping in my 
pajamas. The experience of shopping 
online did not satisfy any of the reasons 
why I love shopping for books. So, why 
did I do it anyway?

To begin to understand the roots of 

my impulse book buying, it is necessary 
to examine the genius marketing 
scheme that raised a generation of 
retail habits: Scholastic Book Fairs.

Once a year in elementary school, 

Scholastic would take over the library 
creating a curated retail space of Junie 
B. Jones, Harry Potter wands and 

hamster posters. For one week, our 
dedicated library time turned into a 
shopping crash course. My classmates 
and I would browse the inventory, 
write our book lists on the provided 
stationery and tally our pocket money. 
It was exhilarating.

A decade later, I still love the 

romance of bookstores. I love how 
all the salespeople wear cable knit 
sweaters and tortoiseshell frames. 
I love the scribbled handwritten 
recommendations 
that 
dot 
the 

bookshelves. I love the old couple 
who spends the entire afternoon 
working on the coffee table puzzle. 
I love when a guy whoàfaintly looks 
like Timotheé Chalamet spends five 
minutes explaining why I need to read 
“The Goldfinch.” I love the tchotchkes. 
The fogged glasses. The Mozart music. 
Going to a bookstore evokes a feeling 
of escapism, to the extent that I forget 
about all the unread books sitting on 
my nightstand and I buy more.

I wish I could say I read all 10 of 

those books this summer. I would even 
be happy if I had read five. I am like 
one of those people who has a gym 
membership, but rarely goes to the 
gym. I buy books and never read them. 
It is pitiful, I know. 

Each week there is a new body of 

research or viral op-ed discussing the 
pitfalls of consumerism or rebuking 
those who no longer read. It would 
appear I am guilty on both accounts. 
I don’t think my reading for school 
or the occasional fluffy beach reads 
qualifies me as a member of the book 
club anymore. And I acknowledge my 
impulse Amazon book purchases do 
not renew my membership to literary 
circles. You actually have to read books 
to be considered a reader.

Despite my remorse, the stack of 

nightstand books continues to remain 
largely untouched. Their uncracked 
spines mocking my ignorance every 
time I reach for my phone or turn off 
the light. Occasionally, a vacation or 
lazy afternoon will summon one of 
those books off the shelf and for a few 

hours, I remember the girl who used to 
read dozens of books — the elementary 
and middle school version of myself. 
The girl who finished the library 
summer reading challenge in June and 
who memorized the account number of 
her library card. 

It is an interesting thing when you 

run into the person you used to be. 
The identity that carried you through 
childhood. Yet it happens every time 
I return to the bookstore. At least 

for a few hours, I reconnect with the 
characters and settings I grew up with. 
I remember how much I loved to read 
and I feel a sudden panic to read again. 
To not lose who I use to be before it is 
too late. And when this feeling creeps 
up when I am not in a bookstore? Well, 
I guess that is when I buy 10 books on 
Amazon. I am beginning to think in 
the future I should go to the library 
instead.

Visual Statement: Lydia Mendelssohn 

Theatre 

BY EMMA RICHTER, SENIOR PHOTO EDITOR

As I was photograph-
ing Pulitzer Prize winner 
Viet Thanh Nguyen at 
the Helen Zell Writ-
ers’ Program event last 
week, I began exploring 
the Lydia Mendelssohn 
Theatre. I got to climb 
up to different platforms, 
peek out from the cur-
tains and roam the back-
stage — and I discovered 
the strange juxtaposi-
tion of the beautiful 
and the industrial that 
exists in this old theater 
tucked into the Michigan 
League. The audience 
only sees one perspec-
tive of the stage and the-
ater, so I tried to capture 
several perspectives of 
the space.

FOR THE USER

The idea that I can take my mind to whatever extent I desire and create 

what I want is one of the most riveting feelings that continuously propels 

me to create genuine work. Whether I am designing an infographic or 

programming an application, I imagine how the user would experience it. 

Studying design at The University of Michigan has put me in the hot seat to 

help pave a better future for the world around me through design.

It is easy to get lost in our schoolwork, become selfish and block anyone else’s 

needs out, but as a designer that is all I seem to think about. Through the 

needs and desires of those around me, I have the power to alleviate stress, 

evoke creativity and inspire those to join me in the process of improving the 

world’s design. Being selfish is never in the equation for me, I consistently 

create for myself in order to enhance my skills to create for others — it’s 

a never-ending cycle. My work is undefinable, yet understandable. I don’t 

believe one piece or even a presentation of my work can put a cap on the 

depth of thoughts and aspirations I have for the good of the users. I refuse 

to be defined by the opinions of others, but rather I rise above and prove 

myself through design.

What is unique about being a designer is I can essentially help shape the 

user’s life, their experiences and their mood as well as give certain scenarios 

context and stir up conversation. The user’s mindless day-to-day tasks and 

encounters are all shaped by design, and I am grateful to be a part of that 

everyday bustle. The paper you are reading, your alarm clock that went 

off this morning and the credit card machine at your coffee shop are all 

shaped by design and gave your day meaning and context. Without your 

alarm clock, you would still be in a deep slumber, and without your morning 

coffee, who knows where you would be. It is beyond fascinating how every 

single thing around me was intricately planned out through design.

Though I often joke about being in a relationship with my computer, the 

reward is unlike any other. Behind the screen there are big dreams, ideas 

and plans to enhance certain products and interfaces that are flawed for the 

user. Behind my screen there are multiple Adobe Create Suite applications 

running at once and a notebook flooded with sketches and mockups of 

potential designs. Behind my screen there is a plethora of written thoughts 

and emotions to keep track of how certain experiences affect me. The users 

shape my life too, and watching them interact or experience my work is 

extremely satisfying. The timeless hours I have spent “in a relationship” with 

my computer, the countless nights my wrists and neck have been sore 

and the endless contemplation of ways I can better my work suddenly 

become worth it for those brief seconds I experience the user interacting 

with my work with ease. The feeling of being a part of this ease is one of 

the greatest gifts, and it is all through design.

Devoting my fingertips to the user will never get old. Taking my mind 

to whatever extent I desire for the future of design will help me 

remain in tune with the quick demands and desires of the 

user. No matter what it is I am designing, I am designing for 

myself to enhance my abilities for the user to pave the way 

for the future of design. My design experiences will allow 

me to be a part of the users’ everyday life. I realize what a 

blessing it is to be able to experience life from both the 

eyes of a designer as well as a user, and I know this will only 

put me in a better place to design the future.


“W

e are quitting at 
two,” a Northern 
Michigan doctor 
named John Tan-

ton told the Alpena News in 1975, refer-
ring to his two daughters. 

Moving to Petoskey, Mich., in 1964 

after a medical residency at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Tanton had long 
established himself as a committed — 
and sometimes eccentric — pillar of the 
local community. Decades before Roe v. 
Wade legalized abortion and when birth 
control was considered taboo, Tanton’s 
wife Mary Lou had been heavily involved 
in Ann Arbor Planned Parenthood; the 
couple established the first Planned Par-
enthood clinic in Northern Michigan and 
expanded access to family planning ser-
vices in the regional clinics. However, 
this was not out of some dedication to 
liberal politics. 

John was also a deeply-committed 

conservationist, 
heavily 
involved 
in 

nationwide 
grassroots 
environmental 

groups. Heavily influenced by the 1968 
book, “The Population Bomb,” which 
warned that exponential population 
growth would devastate the environment 
and food security, to Tanton the goals of 
environmentalism and access to birth 
control were fundamentally intertwined. 
As was the thinking of many other edu-
cated minds of the time, environmental 
preservation meant population control 
could not be a taboo subject. Around this 
era, the post-Baby Boom birth rate had 
tapered off and the immigration restric-
tions of the early 20th century rolled 
back; population growth in the United 
States had come to be driven by immigra-
tion. 

“Even back in high school, my idea was 

that man’s role was not to multiply and 
subdue the earth,” Tanton recounted in a 
1989 interview. “But to exist in easy part-
nership with it and to study the natural 
world.”

This vision of environmental preser-

vation and population control, combined 
with a zeal for activism, would ultimate-
ly manifest itself in Tanton — himself 
the son of a Canadian immigrant — as a 
fervor for restricting immigration into 

the U.S. In the decade that followed the 
opening newspaper quote, Tanton would 
become one of the preeminent national 
voices to limit American immigration, 
both illegal and legal, and his life’s work 
has made him one of the most consequen-
tial figures in shaping the modern anti-

immigration movement in this country. 

Despite living half a country away from 

Capitol Hill, Tanton helped establish the 
Federation for American Immigration 
Reform and a myriad of other advocacy 
groups in the late 1970s and 1980s that 
would shift the national conversation 
against both legal and illegal immigra-
tion in two subsequent generations.

Largely avoiding the public spot-

light and attempting to cast himself as 
a gentleman doctor, Tanton’s detractors 
— including the Southern Poverty Law 
Center — have labeled him as a white 
nationalist, though he himself takes 
offense to the label. 

In 2007, pushing the age of 73, he 

donated 25 boxes filled with his corre-
spondence — dating back from the late 
1960s up until the early years of the new 
millennium — to the University of Michi-
gan’s Bentley Historical Library. The 
first 14 boxes are accessible to the public. 
The remainder are sealed until 2035 per 
Tanton’s request and primarily contain 
documents related to FAIR and the later 
years of his life.

In our present political moment, immi-

gration has become perhaps the most 
bitterly polarizing issue in U.S. politics. 
A New York real estate developer has 

ascended to the White House on over-
tones of racial revanchism and draconian 
crackdowns on immigration, and many of 
the current administration’s strict immi-
gration agenda originate from groups 
tied to the Michigan doctor. 

Contemporary liberals tend to attri-

bute the anti-immigration politics of the 
present to an ignorance of America’s his-
tory as a nation of immigrants. Indeed, it 
is one of the oldest ironies of this coun-
try that the descendents of immigrants 
— such as Tanton — would reject subse-
quent generations of arrivals as unable to 
join the country, be it the Irish and Ital-
ian Catholics or Eastern European Jews 

on the East Coast, or the Chinese on the 
West Coast. 

The Tanton of the 1970s was well 

aware of this tragic irony in his writings 
and explicitly warned against repeating 
the mistakes of the past. Nevertheless, 
by the 1990s he had evolved to associate 
with some of the nation’s most influen-
tial white nationalists. An extension of 
his decades-held beliefs would ultimate-
ly consume his political philosophy with 
the idea of preserving a homogenous 
American civilization against the per-
ceived threat of immigrants and diver-
sity. As his public persona and private 
writings descended into white national-
ism, it remains to be seen how much of 
this transformation reflected a genuine 
ideological evolution to embrace bigot-
ry rather than from prejudices that had 
been hidden behind his public motives, 
much like his advocacy for birth control.
I

n 1956, Tanton — then a senior 
at Michigan State University — 
arrived in Chicago alongside 11 

other Rhodes Scholarship finalists to 
compete for roughly half-a-dozen awards 
to study in Oxford, England that had 
been set aside for Midwesterners.

country schoolhouse, he credited most 
of his education to being self-taught, 
and he had excelled at his studies in 
MSU. However, Tanton found himself 
feeling out-classed by his peers who 
came from wealthier upbringings and 
East Coast Ivy Leagues, and he was 
ultimately not awarded a scholarship. 

Still taking pride in how far he had 

made it in the Rhodes Scholarship pro-
cess, Tanton entered the University of 
Michigan Medical School following his 
graduation from MSU. In Ann Arbor, he 
continued to excel at his studies, mar-
ried a fellow student and completed an 
ophthalmology residency in 1964. Fond 
of their rural upbringings, the Tantons 
moved to Petoskey, Mich., a small town 
in the north of the state famed for its 
freshwater polished stones that bear 
the town’s name, and John Tanton 
became one of the few ophthalmologi-
cal surgeons in the region. 

Tanton has been a meticulous hoard-

er of letters, news clippings, and other 
correspondence that began at this 
time, and his public file in the Bentley 
Library paints an incomplete portrait 
of a dizzyingly busy community activ-
ist and outdoors enthusiast. 

According to a résumé he saved in 

his folder, at the time he held positions 
including president of the Northern 
Michigan Planned Parenthood, as well 
as various state and national positions 
in the Sierra Club, League of Conser-
vation Voters and other local conser-
vation clubs — all while practicing 
medicine. In local news clippings from 
that time, he is referred to as a promi-
nent local environmentalist. In an 

article published by North Woodscall 
in 1977 about Tanton’s appointment to 
the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore 
Advisory Commission, he’s introduced 
as a “Petoskey surgeon” and “one of 
Michigan’s leading environmentalists.” 

The doctor considered himself an 

eccentric philanthropist willing to sup-
port causes he felt others weren’t will-
ing to touch. He once wrote to a medical 
colleague that despite donating 10 per-
cent of his income to charity, he and his 
wife chose to “treat (our) contributions 
as venture capital and put them into 
high-risk areas that are struggling to 
get started … where we hope our pit-
tance can make a difference.”

It was around the mid-1970s that Tan-

ton’s interests fixated him on human 
migration, leading him to believe it 
threatened environmental conserva-
tion by draining resources, hurt the 
economic well-being of developing 
nations 
by 
draining 
highly-skilled 

workers and hurt the working class 
and environment of nations receiv-
ing immigrants by straining resources 

and labor markets. The issue that kept 
discussions about limiting migration 
out of the mainstream, Tanton would 
write in 1975 in an essay tying migra-
tion control and conservationism, was 
America’s unique history as a nation of 
immigrants. Tanton himself expressed 

a discomfort with the country’s history 
of violent racism and xenophobia. 

“This visceral reaction (to immigra-

tion restrictions) is understandable, as 
most of us have immigrant roots, and 
we feel compromised,” Tanton wrote. 
“An aversion to discussing immigra-
tion is also understandable in light of 
the seamy history surrounding past 
efforts to limit immigration. These 
were marked by xenophobia and rac-
ism, and gave rise to the likes of the 
Know-Nothing political party, and the 
Ku Klux Klan.”

However, according to Tanton, this 

unseemly history was insufficient rea-
son for limits to migration to become 
a fair topic of debate. Nonetheless, his 
writings would come to exhibit the 
xenophobia and racism of which he 

noted of in 1975.
S

ensing that his liberal 
Planned 
Parenthood 

and 
conservationist 

colleagues weren’t willing to 
put immigration on the table as 
a means to control population 
growth, Tanton struck out with 
several like-minded associates 
to raise several thousand dol-
lars and establish FAIR in 1978 
as a D.C.-based issues-advocacy 
group. Tanton would continue 
practicing medicine in Peto-
skey, except for a brief hiatus 
when he and his family moved 
to Arlington, Virg., in 1981. The 
group drove grassroots and 
media advocacy campaigns, and 
took advantage of access with 
sympathetic policymakers from 
both parties on Capitol Hill. 

“It was great working on the 

population problem as long as 
we could flagellate ourselves 
for being bad people by hav-
ing too many children,” Tanton 

said in 1989. “But then the birth 

rate fell precipitately during the 1970s, 
at the same time that the immigration 
rate was going up.”

Tanton’s entry to this issue was 

largely reactive to a transformation 
of U.S. immigration that began the 
preceding decade. Since 1921, U.S. 
immigration laws had placed strict 
limits on the number of people admit-
ted from outside of Northern Europe, 
crafted specifically to exclude certain 
groups deemed undesirable and pre-
serve a white anglophone majority in 
the country. This was nullified by the 
Hart-Celler Act of 1965, which replaced 
the racially-biased quota system with 
criteria favoring those with high-value 
skills and familial ties to U.S. residents. 

Simultaneously, the development of 

the American Southwest created a new-
found demand for cheap agricultural 
labor from Latin America composed of 
both illegal and legal migrants. These 
two forces would begin driving a demo-
graphic change in the U.S.

Tanton’s goal wasn’t to revert Amer-

ica’s immigration policies to the 1921 
status quo, which he considered to be 
too openly prejudiced. 

“At times, our immigration policy has 

actually been rather racist,” he ironi-
cally told the Houston Chronicle in 
1981. 

In Tanton’s words, the early goal of 

FAIR was to allow immigration restric-
tion to become a socially acceptable 
topic of political debate. He and his 
colleagues hoped to also transcend the 
political spectrum with a what he con-
sidered centrist anti-immigration plat-
form that would ostensibly avoid the 
open bigotry of the past. Of the initial 
five board members of the organiza-
tion, he described only one as “on the 
conservative side,” himself and anoth-
er board member as centrists and the 
other two as liberals. On a day-to-day 
basis FAIR also vocally opposed federal 
programs for migrants in the courts of 
law and public opinion.

“You want to appeal to a person’s 

emotions but to do it in a way that’s still 
respectable,” Tanton said in 1989.We 
didn’t want somebody reading back to 
us in a Congressional committee some-
thing that we didn’t want to live with.”

In its initial years, FAIR was cautious 

of its messaging, wary of using “dema-
gogic” appeals that could sully its pub-
lic image as racist. However, Tanton 
would note that this allowed parallel 
groups to emerge to FAIR’s right that 
advocated for similar policies in much 
more inflammatory terms. 
B

y 1982, Tanton and a subset 
of his colleagues came to be 
frustrated with FAIR’s moder-

ate messaging points and began explor-
ing the use of inflammatory linguistic 
and cultural wedge issues to drive their 
anti-immigration message. By then, his 
writings increasingly came to reflect a 

“In the decade that followed the opening newspaper 

quote, Tanton would become one of the preeminent 

national voices to limit American immigration, both ille-

gal and legal, and his life’s work has made him one of the 

most consequential figures in shaping the modern anti-

immigration movement in this country.”

worldview that a culturally diversify-
ing America was leading to a civiliza-
tional clash. 

“When the question came up of 

whether we should broaden FAIR’s 
bundle of issues — taking a look at cul-
tural division and bilingualism and the 
changing composition of the American 
population and what that might mean 
— there was a great deal of resistance, 
as you say, to getting into what seemed 
like dangerous territory,” he said. 

Despite the misgivings of some of his 

fellow anti-immigration activists, Tan-
ton and his associates came to embrace 
more divisive, high-profile tactics to 
drive support to their issue. They came 
to focus on the American Southwest, 
the prime destination of migrants from 
Latin America for generations, where 
Tanton felt the cause of immigration 
restriction to be the most salient. 

“Because the problems of immigra-

tion had already become sufficiently 
acute in areas like California, the polit-
ical system was already compromised 
there,” he recounted in 1989, suggest-
ing that he didn’t believe the Hispanic 
populations in the Southwest were 
entitled to political representation over 
white Americans. “Politicians could no 
longer take stands for fear of back pres-
sure from the immigrant populations.” 

The most provocative push by Tan-

ton was a direct advocacy campaign 
to enshrine English as the official lan-
guage of the U.S., in a rebuke of the 
bilingual English-Spanish society that 
had been emerging in the Southwest 
as a result of migration. With several 
high-profile backers, including former 
California Republican Sen. Ichiye Hay-
akawa — who was born in Canada and 
was of Japanese descent — and former 
CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite 
he helped launch the advocacy group 
U.S. English to accomplish this, initial-
ly by forcing ballot referendums on the 
issue in states such as California and 
Arizona. 

It was this latest endeavor that final-

ly put Tanton — who didn’t care much 
for public appearances — and the true 
nature of his worldview into the pub-
lic’s eye. 

In 1988, the Arizona Republic leaked 

a memo written by Tanton to an inner 
circle of his associates just days before 
the vote on a divisive Arizona ballot 
proposal to enshrine English as the 
official language of the state. In the 
memo, Tanton had made explicitly 
racial arguments that large-scale His-
panic migration threatened the foun-
dations of American society. 

California, 
he 
claimed, 
would 

become akin to the South African 
apartheid by 2030 as a result of Latin 
American immigration, and he sug-
gested Blacks and Hispanics would 
form a permanent socioeconomic and 
cultural underclass. 

Furthermore, he insinuated that 

Latin American immigrants would 
bring an inherently corruptible civic 
culture antithetical to American soci-
ety, and that they were of an inferior 
intelligence. 

The view of growing cultural, lin-

guistic and racial diversity as a threat 

to the cohesion of American society is 
consistent with many of Tanton’s other 
private writings that are archived in 
the Bentley Library around this era. 
This political philosophy is hardly 
unique to Tanton, and echo the writ-
ings of controversial political scientist 
Charles Murray, among others. 

Backlash would be swift, with many 

of Tanton’s prominent allies — includ-
ing Cronkite — condemning him and 
resigning from U.S. English. Tanton 
yielded to public pressure and also 
resigned from the group. In an inter-
view the following year, Tanton stated 
that the contents of the memo reflected 
his sincere beliefs, though they didn’t 
reflect the talking points he would use 
in public. He also stated that he regrets 
resigning from U.S. English, insisting 
that he had done no wrong.

“My memo was written for a group of 

people who were already initiated into 
immigration, population and language 
issues,” he said. “It was not written for 
people off the street who’d never heard 
any of these ideas before and had no 
background in them.”

Despite the Arizona Republic’s rev-

elations, the voters of Arizona would 
go on to narrowly affirm the proposal 
several days later, banning the state 
government from offering services 
in Spanish (outside of several nar-
row exceptions) by 12,000 votes out of 
roughly 1.1 million cast. 
T

he records available to the 
public in the Bentley Library 
dating to the early 1990s and 

later are largely closed to the public, a 
precondition of Tanton’s 2007 dona-
tion. Nonetheless, there are certain 
aspects of his life that are public record 
beyond this point. Remaining in Peto-
skey and continuing his medical prac-

tice, he would still remain active in his 
network of anti-immigration advocacy 
groups — including FAIR — though he 
avoided the limelight. 

A year after his donation to the 

Bentley Library, the Southern Pov-
erty Law Center published a report 
detailing extensive communications 

between 
Tanton 
and 
high-profile 

white supremacists — including Jared 
Taylor, Peter Brimelow and Kevin 
MacDonald — throughout the 1990s. In 
these communications Tanton regular-
ly expressed sympathy for their views 
that immigration from non-Western 
societies would undermine “Western 
Civilization.”

“We’re very concerned that his ide-

ologies are at best sympathetic and at 
worst fully supportive of white nation-
alists,” said Humza Kazmi, one of sev-
eral Virginia immigration attorneys 
who has studied Tanton’s network. 
Kazmi and his colleagues sued the 
University of Michigan last Novem-
ber to release the entirety of Tanton’s 
papers, arguing that the embargoed 
documents will demonstrate the full 
extent to which he embraced white 
nationalism and influenced present-
day policymakers.

The University has resisted the law-

suit in court, arguing that it is con-
tractually bound to honor Tanton’s 
donation agreement to withhold files 
until 2035, as is the case with many 
donors to the library. Currently, the 
case is awaiting appeal by the plain-
tiffs. 

How does one reconcile the racial 

belief system shown in Tanton’s Ari-
zona Republic memo, and the Tanton 
who warned that America’s history of 
violent racism shouldn’t be repeated, 
who initially shied away from “dema-
gogic” tactics in FAIR’s early years, 
and who himself was the son of an 
immigrant and expressed a fondness 
for America’s melting pot history? Per-
haps he experienced a genuine ideolog-
ical evolution that lead him to embrace 
a vision of racial exclusion and white 
nationalism. 

But another possibility is that he had 

always held these views of racial hier-
archy, and he advocated for non-racial 
immigration restrictionism as a ruse to 
one day normalize his vision. After all, 
he regularly expressed in his papers 
that his overarching goal was to bring 
immigration restriction into the politi-
cal mainstream without any social 
stigma. 

In his 1989 oral history, Tanton 

envisioned “three stages in the immi-
gration debate.” The first, which he 
dubbed the “Statue of Liberty phase,” 
was where any discussion of limiting 
immigration is viewed as inherently 
anti-American. The second he dubbed 
as the “‘Yes, but’ phase” where limited 
discussion about immigration would 
be possible in the political main-
stream.

“Then the third stage, which I think 

we still have yet to move into, is one 
in which it’s accepted as a legitimate 
topic and you can discuss it without 
being accused of things, or without 
first excusing yourself for being con-
cerned about immigration policy,” 
Tanton said in 1989. 

In the present day, perhaps we are 

on the cusp of entering Tanton’s third 
stage of debate. Individuals with ties to 
white supremacists have held official 
positions in the current White House, 
the President of the United States 
has suggested there is moral equiva-
lency between Nazis and their oppo-
nents and prime time Fox News hosts 
Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham 
regularly go on screeds against “demo-
graphic change” and diversity with no 
professional repercussions. It is also a 
legitimate question how much of the 
current 
administration’s 
inhumane 

immigration crackdown is driven by a 
legitimate concern for border security, 
and how much driven by racial animus 
against non-white immigration. 

As for Tanton, he has reached his 

mid-80s but his wife told the Detroit 
News in 2017 that he had contracted 
advanced-stage Parkinson’s disease 
and has been committed to a nursing 
home. He reportedly has had a difficult 
time understanding the news. FAIR 
and other organizations he helped 
shape continue to exist and are outspo-
ken advocates of the president’s immi-
gration agenda. 

Was Tanton the architect of our 

divisive political moment, or simply a 
gadfly who held wildly diverging polit-
ical views that foreshadowed the divi-
sion that would come decades later? 
The true extent of his role in shaping 
the present will continue to be unclear, 
until perhaps the remainder of the 
Bentley archives open in 17 years. It 
will be much longer before it will be 
clear how the demographic identity of 
our nation and what it means to be an 
American will change.
