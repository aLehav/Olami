LSA 
sophomore 
Nisreen 
Khokhar is currently enrolled 
in Arabic 402 and has taken 
various Arabic courses at the 
100 and 200-levels throughout 
her college experience. Like 
Arabic 
language 
students 
across the nation, Khokhar 
and others in the University 
of Michigan’s Department of 
Middle East Studies currently 
go 
back 
and 
forth 
about 
whether or not the University 
should be teaching Modern 
Standard Arabic or informal 
Arabic dialects, like Egyptian 
or Levantine.
“Honestly, I would love more 
exposure to dialect, but at the 
same time, because there’s 
so much difference (between 
MSA and dialect), that I think 
MSA tends to be what foreign 
language students learn in 
general,” Khokar said. “I think 
the fact that (the department 
teaches) both in the first 
two years is actually pretty 
great because it gives you an 

introduction.”
Arabic is characterized as 
a diglossic language, meaning 
that it has formal and informal 
registers that are used in 
different 
circumstances. 
MSA and Classical Arabic — 
known as Fush’a — are used 
in newspapers, books, official 
documents and other formal 
correspondences, 
while 
informal Arabic — known as 
Ammiya — is typically present 
in music, pop culture and 
spoken 
among 
family 
and 
friends. MSA is first learned in 
school, while Ammiya is most 
Arab speakers’ vernacular.
Between 2006 and 2009, 
enrollment in Arabic language 
programs grew by 47 percent 
across 
U.S. 
universities, 
sparking 
increased 
debate 
about 
whether 
to 
teach 
colloquial Arabic dialects in 
addition to MSA. Currently 
in the department, the first 
two years of coursework are 
focused on both MSA and 
dialect, but the curriculum 
shifts exclusively to MSA in the 
levels that follow.

Multicultural center set to open on State Street following years of advocacy by students

Wednesday afternoon, more than 
50 University of Michigan student 
leaders, staff and faculty gathered in 
the Trotter Multicultural Center on 
Washtenaw Avenue one final time 
for the Trotter to Trotter Commu-
nity Walk ahead of the grand opening 
of the new building on State Street 
Thursday morning. Mingling over 
food and drinks, attendees acknowl-
edged the work of past activists and 

reminisced over memories in the 
Washtenaw building before walking 
down South University Street and 
through the Diag to the new building 
on State Street.
According to Vice President for 
Student Life E. Royster Harper, the 
initiative to move the Trotter Cen-
ter from Washtenaw Avenue to a 
more central location was the result 
of over a decade of student activism. 
Harper explained students of color 
pointed out the original location of 

the Trotter Center on the periphery 
of campus seemed to reflect com-
munities of color being on the 
periphery of the University as 
well. The Washtenaw location’s dis-
tance from the center of campus also 
posed accessibility and safety issues, 
Harper said. 
According to Harper, University 
efforts to move the Trotter Center to 
State Street began four years ago.
“I think this is a powerful and 
emotional experience for a lot of peo-

ple who love the University, who want 
the University to be a place where 
everyone feels they have a home and 
they belong,” Harper said. “So I think 
what’s wonderful about the new loca-
tion is that it’s in the heart of cam-
pus… So what we’re saying is that’s in 
the heart of who we are, what we do 
and what we’re committed to … For 
me, the new Trotter is about a new 
beginning on our campus with each 
other and for each other.”

LSA sophomore Cristina Guytingco speaks on the importance of bringing together communities of color during the conclusion of the Trotter to 
Trotter Community Walk at the new Trotter Multicultural Center Wednesday.

When 
astronomers 
announced 
on 
Wednesday 
they had captured the first-
ever photo of a black hole, 
an 
international 
team 
of 
scientists 
said 
they 
had 
seen 
the 
“unseeable.” 
Collaborating with more than 
200 researchers across the 
world, 
the 
Event 
Horizon 
Telescope project used data 
from eight radio telescopes 
in six locations provided the 
input necessary to compile 
the photo. Katie Bouman, a 
University of Michigan alum 
and postdoctoral fellow at 
MIT, created an algorithm as 
a graduate student that helped 
make the groundbreaking feat 
possible.
Now an assistant professor 
at 
the 
California 
Institute 
Of Technology, Bouman got 
her start at the University, 
graduating with a B.S.E. in 
Electrical 
Engineering 
in 
2011. Following the project’s 
achievement, Bouman’s name 
was trending nationally on 
Twitter Wednesday night.

The Carceral State Project 
hosted its last event of the aca-
demic school year on Wednes-
day night to discuss the future of 
the carceral state and concrete 
actions people can take to change 
the system. The event was part 
of its symposium series and was 
cosponsored by Afro-American 
Studies, History and the Residen-
tial College, drawing in a crowd 
of approximately 100 community 
members and students and fea-
tured a panel of five speakers. 
Amanda 
Alexander, 
execu-
tive director at the Detroit Jus-
tice Center and a senior research 
scholar at the University of 

Michigan Law School, moderated 
the event. Alexander began the 
roundtable by asking the panel-
ists what true community safety 
looks like and how their defini-
tions relate to the current carceral 
state.
Panelist PG Watkins, an orga-
nizer at No New Jails, said they 
feel most safe when the people 
around them are safe and have 
all their necessities, such as food 
and shelter, taken care of. Wat-
kins noted many people resort to 
crime in order to provide for their 
families. 
“So to me, when I think about 
the times I felt most safe, or what 
could make me feel safer when I 
don’t feel safe, is really a lot about 
like knowing who’s around me,” 

Watkins said. “Feeling a sense 
of connectivity and community. 
Something that I talk about is like, 
I can feel safe when I know all my 
basic needs are met and the peo-
ple around me have their needs 
met. You know, everything’s 
taken care of, there’s no reason to, 
ideally, there’s no reason to cause 
harm or hurt each other because 
everything that we need is there 
for us.”
Watkins continued by saying 
their idea of safety is completely 
separate from the carceral state. 
Watkins discussed how, if every-
body supports their communities, 
the effort to make sure everyone 
has their basic necessities covered 
will expand to larger society.
“In my ideal world in the world 

that I try to practice and be in 
community with every day is 
disconnected from the carceral 
state,” Watkins said. “But I do 
think it starts with us. Focus-
ing really hyper local, like on our 
blocks, in our neighborhood, is 
how can we make sure that we 
are good with each other, and that 
will echo out.”
Panelist Korbin Felder, pro-
gram 
associate 
at 
America 
Friends Service Committee, dis-
cussed how different people have 
varying relationships on safety 
and the carceral state. He said 
regardless of his own opinion, 
many people feel the criminal 
justice system reduces crime and 
are not in favor of getting rid of it 
completely.

Michael J. Steinberg, public interest/public service faculty fellow at the University of Michigan, speaks at the Carceral State roundtable in 
Hatcher Graduate Library Wednesday afternoon.

“The 
Ordered 
Liberty” 
podcast co-hosts David French 
and 
Alexandra 
DeSanctis 
stopped at Weill Hall at the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
to record a live episode on 
Wednesday night. While their 
main focus was conservatism 
on campus, they also touched on 
populism, abortion, democratic 
socialism 
and 
free 
speech. 
The University of Michigan’s 
American Enterprise Institute’s 
Executive Council, along with 
the National Review Institute On 
Campus and Young Americans 
for Freedom at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
sponsored 
the 
segment titled “Liberty with 
Integrity: How consistency and 
civility are inseparable from the 
conservative case for freedom.”
The podcast covers religion, 
culture and politics. French is a 
veteran and an attorney, as well 
as a senior fellow at NRI, and 
DeSanctis is a staff writer for 
National Review.
After making jokes about 
Michigan State and Ohio State, 
French introduced the main 
topic.

ALEC COHEN/Daily

You’re about three weeks 
away from finishing your 
sophomore year. Being 
almost halfway done with 
your education, how do 
you feel? What do you plan 
to accomplish the coming 
couple of semesters? 

I feel intimidated by the 
fact that in some two odd 
years, I will be an ‘adult’. 
While I have learned a lot in 
college, there is still a lot to 
learn about life, outside of 
school. I suppose what’s so 
intimidating about being done 
with college is the current 
ambiguity that surrounds 
what my occupation will be 
post-graduation. These final 
two years, I hope to find clarity 
in my career’s direction, and 
continue maintain a healthy 
and happy life

PODCAST
From Page 1A

“In 
the 
age 
of 
Trump, 
(conservatism on campus) is 
a huge topic for conservatives 
who are trying to figure out 
how to be ambassadors for 
their point of view and their 
movement on college campus 
in particular,” French said. 
“It sort of boils down to… can 
you be civil and decent and 
still own the libs? And this is 
something that you begin to 
see a lot in our hyperpolarized 
times — that we live in a world 
where it seems as if persuasion 
is gone and what we’re doing is 
we’re trying to stoke our own 
bases as a way to win.”
In response to the Chick-
Fil-A 
Bans 
controversy, 
in 

which the chain has been 
banned from certain locations 
because of a “legacy of anti-
LGBTQ behvior,” French said 
the culture war is worsening 
as progressive intolerance is 
extending to big companies and 
corporations.
“The 
Chick-fil-A 
problem 
sums 
up 
the 
issue 
that 
conservatives are dealing with 
in a lot of places, especially 
college campuses,” DeSanctis 
said.
DeSanctis said she believes 
“punching back” is the wrong 
approach to the culture war.
“What we should be talking 
about is substance,” DeSanctis 
said. “We should be talking 
about why Chick-Fil-A should 
be allowed to be in airports, 
why Salvation Army is not a 

hateful group, why it’s not 
just a problem of just a poor 
conservative 
group 
that 
doesn’t make you a hateful 
organization. 
But 
instead, 
people 
are 
fighting 
about 
whether or not we should be 
writing mean tweets or stoking 
the flames of the culture war.”
According 
to 
French, 
American 
citizens 
are 
constitutionally freer than ever 
before.
“As of right now, you have 
more rights to speak and to 
freely exercise your religion 
that any time ever on free 
speech rights and in more 
than a generation on religious 
liberty,” French said. “And 
that’s not secured by 5-4 
majorities of the court. The 
leading religious liberty case of 
the last 20 years was decided 
9-0.”
French said the current 
issues are based on culture 
rather than laws.
“It’s not because of the 
government,” 
French 
said. 
“It’s because of your peers. It’s 
because of your employers. It’s 
because of the Twitter mob. 
It’s the shame campaigns. And 
that’s not judges, okay, that’s 
culture... so, the question 
that I’m consistently asking is 
what is the mechanism, what 
is the plan for conservatives 
to be ambassadors to a culture 
that is increasingly turning 
its back on free exercise, free 
speech, and locked in the 
enormous battle?”
DeSanctis 
tied 
this 
uncertainty 
back 
to 
conservatism 
activism 
on 
campus. 
She 
said 
young 
conservatives often feel they 
do not have a voice, especially 
when 
they 
are 
the 
only 
conservative in a classroom.
“You 
probably 
have 
situations where you feel like 
in class either the professor 
is going to shut you down or 

your peers are gonna think 
you’re insane if you actually 
say what you think,” DeSanctis 
said. “The purpose of a college 
education in my mind is to 
seek the truth and you can’t 
do that if you aren’t able to say 
what you think is true because 
you think you’re going to be 
shouted down.”
French said there is constant 
and 
widespread 
confusion 
between manner and ideology 
among 
American 
society, 
saying Trump was one of the 
most centrist candidates put 
forward by the GOP since 
President Gerald Ford in the 
1970s.
“For example, would you call 
Trump moderate? Most people 
now would say ‘Trump is not 
at all moderate,’” French said. 
“He is extremely aggressive… 
he is extremely contentious in 
his manner (and) his demeanor. 
But in many ways, he is the least 
ideological, 
most 
moderate 
political candidate that the 
GOP has nominated since Ford 
maybe.”
French 
emphasized 
the 
importance of mainly focusing 
on and targeting persuadable 
opponents.
“If you aim your expression, 
and you dictate your expression 
by your communications with 
the unpersuadable opposition, 
you are going to be more 
frustrated and more angry 
and often deceived as to the 
effectiveness of conservative 
communication,” French said.
French provided an example 
from when he was in law school 
in 1992 and his professor would 
not refer to an “unborn child” 
or “fetus” but rather a “clump 
of cells” or a “biologic product.” 
Out of frustration, he raised his 
hand and asked why she would 
not use a term such as “fetus,” 
and he was shocked by the 
reaction of his classmates.

Bouman 
explained 
the 
research team’s process to CNN.
“We 
developed 
ways 
to 
generate synthetic data and used 
different algorithms and tested 
blindly to see if we can recover 
an image,” Bouman said. “We 
didn’t want to just develop one 
algorithm. We wanted to develop 
many different algorithms that 
all have different assumptions 
built into them. If all of them 
recover 
the 
same 
general 
structure, then that builds your 
confidence.”
The result was a slightly blurry 
photo of a black hole in Messier 
87, a galaxy more than 50 million 
light years away, surrounded by a 
bright orange ring.
Various obstacles have blocked 
scientists 
from 
successfully 
photographing black holes in the 
past, ranging from the challenges 

associated with overcoming the 
physical distance from earth to 
the difficulty of taking a picture 
of something that essentially 
devours light.
Bouman led the development 
of the algorithm that proved 
crucial 
in 
the 
process 
of 
devising imaging methods. That 
algorithm, which was created 
in 
2016, 
patched 
together 
information collected from radio 
telescopes located around the 
globe. Bouman discussed the 
process in an interview with 
MIT News in June of that year.
“Radio 
wavelengths 
come 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
advantages,” 
Bouman said. “Just like how 
radio frequencies will go through 
walls, 
they 
pierce 
through 
galactic dust. We would never be 
able to see into the center of our 
galaxy in visible wavelengths 
because there’s too much stuff in 
between.”

According to Trotter Center 
Director Julio Cardona, many 
alumni have called him voicing 
excitement and support for the 
new Trotter Center. Cardona 
said the move to State Street 
from Washtenaw Avenue rep-
resents collaboration and mul-
ticulturalism among a variety 
of student groups. 
“What we saw in recent 
months is a collective of stu-
dent 
groups 
where 
before 
everyone was in their own 
silos,” Cardona said. “That to 
me is the students saying, ‘Let’s 
just work together and really 
for the greater good.’ I think 
that will be a lasting impres-
sion. I hope students can take 
this experience to their career, 
and then explain to their 
friends and co-workers what 
true multiculturalism could be 
like because they experienced 
that here.”
Before the walk to Trotter 
Center on State Street, stu-
dents, staff and faculty shared 
how the Trotter Center has 
impacted their time at the Uni-
versity and what the Trotter 
Center location change means 
to them.
LSA senior Camyrea Barnes, 
secretary of the Black Student 
Union, recalled attending her 
first BSU meeting at the Trot-
ter Center her freshman year. 
After years of long walks to 
the Trotter Center on Washt-
enaw Avenue for BSU meet-
ings, Barnes said the opening 
of the Trotter Center on State 
Street is an emotional moment 
for her.
“We made this walk faith-
fully every other Thursday 
to the BSU meeting,” Barnes 
said. “Now I’m graduating, 
and seeing this space that’s 
being opened on State Street 
on a central location for Black 
students to go to and congre-
gate and have mass meetings, 
knowing the decades of work 
that’s been put in by students 

to have this moment, it’s very 
emotional. My heart is just so 
full that it’s actually happen-
ing.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Cristina 
Guytingco, 
programming 
chair of United Asian Ameri-
can Organizations and a mem-
ber of the Trotter on State 
planning committee, said the 
Trotter Center is an important 
space for communities of color 
to host a variety of events.
“Trotter was the only space 
where we could have events 
because everywhere else you 
had to pay, you had to book, 
you had to navigate all these 
regulations, but we always 
could count on Trotter,” Guyt-
ingco said.

tor and another member of 
the Trotter on State planning 
committee, said she started 
her time at the University at 
the Trotter Center. Harris said 
she’s looking forward to form-
ing new memories across com-
munities of color at the new 
Trotter Center on State Street. 
“Personally for me, Trot-
ter is where I started,” Harris 
said. “For the Latinx commu-
nity, we have our orientation 
program here … And I have so 
many memories of meeting so 
many different people in this 
space. And this new Trotter 
means so many new memories 
are going to be made. And I’m 
just so excited because not only 
will it be a space for our com-
munity, but it’s a space for all of 
our marginalized communities, 
not separately but together.” 
Elizabeth James, BSU adviser 
and Department of Afroameri-
can and African Studies pro-
gram manager, said the Trotter 
Center has been an integral 
part of her campus experience 
since she became involved in 
BSU in 1980. James voiced how 
meaningful of a space the Trot-
ter Center has been for commu-
nities of color. 
“It’s just such a beauti-
ful thing to see all of us here 
together and to see that this is 

actually real,” James said. “I 
can’t tell you how many nights 
I’ve dreamed about being closer 
to campus because I knew how 
cold it was for you all to walk 
down here because I’d walked 
down too. I knew how much 
this place meant to you because 
you did make that trek. It was 
a strange kind of calling that 
brought us all here but we knew 
this was the place to be.”

Chuck 
Ransom, 
Multicul-
tural Studies and American 
Culture librarian, is currently 
working on a project archiving 
the history of the Trotter Cen-
ter. According to Ransom, the 
Trotter Center’s origins began 
with a group of Black female 
students in the 1960s who 
approached University Hous-
ing asking for an all-Black floor 
in the residential halls. Among 
other initiatives to help Black 
students facing marginaliza-
tion at the University, students 
in the Black Action Movement 
spearheaded the 1971 opening 
of the Trotter House, a Black 
student cultural center named 
in honor of civil rights activist 
William Monroe Trotter, Ran-
som explained. 

In 1981, after requests for 
their own cultural centers from 
several other minority groups, 
the 
University 
decided 
to 
expand Trotter into a student 
multicultural center.
LSA 
sophomore 
Ugochi 
Ndupu, peace officer of BSU 
and a member of the Trotter on 
State planning committee, rec-
ognized the efforts of BAM and 
Being Black at U-M, a move-
ment started by BSU in 2013 to 
share experiences of Black stu-
dents on campus. BBUM gained 
national traction, eventually 
releasing a list of demands. The 
demands included the creation 
of a Trotter Center closer to the 
center of campus. 
Ndupu expressed the Trotter 
Centers on Washtenaw Avenue 
and State Street are possible 
due to the work of student activ-
ists in these movements. Ndupu 
said the new Trotter Center on 
State Street compels her to con-
tinue their work. 
“It made me realize as a 
Black student here on campus, I 
have a purpose to keep that leg-
acy of student activism going 
and also to make sure that their 
demands are getting carried 
out and appreciating the work 
that they’ve done,” Ndupu said. 
“That’s why new Trotter means 
so much to me.”
Guytingco echoed Ndupu’s 
sentiments, also acknowledg-
ing past student activists and 
expressing students of color 
will continue to take up the 
space they deserve on campus. 
“It’s really emotional and 
impactful for me to know that 
so many students, so many 
people that have gone before 
us have fought for this space on 
campus,” Guytingco said. “And 
now for me to carry on their 
legacy through our work, where 
people of color and marginal-
ized groups have a space on 
Central Campus, this is really 
empowering for me and I hope 
for so many others. We have 
a space, and we’re here, and 
we’re going to continue to take 
up space because we do.”

“I went to U of M, I took 
these similar classes as an 
undergraduate… we had to 
talk about race, we had to talk 
about white supremacy, but 
just because someone is Black 
or just because someone’s for-
merly incarcerated it actu-
ally doesn’t mean that they’re 
going to support abolition, per 
se,” Felder said.
Alexander then asked the 
panelists about strategies to 
go beyond the carceral state 
and what current projects give 
them the greatest sense of 
hope moving forward.
Felder discussed the prog-
ress Michigan has already 
made in terms of criminal 
justice reform. He referenced 
his work in other states, such 
as Alabama and Mississippi, 
and emphasized how the high 
attendance at the event is 
inspiring.
“You don’t see people show-
ing up in other places after 
hours like you all did today,” 
Felder said. “Michigan has 
made progress, I could talk 
all day about the progress. 
Sure, we have problems. We 
spend more on corrections 
than higher education. It is a 
huge bureaucracy, but we have 
made progress and it would be 
irresponsible for us not to talk 
about the progress we have 
made.”
Panelist Michael Steinberg, 
legal director of the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Mich-
igan, also discussed his cur-
rent hope for the future of the 
carceral state. He addressed 
how mass incarceration has 
become a bipartisan issue, 
which allows for more pro-
ductive policy making. 
“I am hopeful — I have never 
been more hopeful on this 
issue than I am right now,” 
Steinberg said. “The reason I 
am hopeful to the point that 
it is not a partisan issue. …
(Conservatives) don’t support 
mass incarceration either, it’s 

not for the reasons we oppose 
it, for humanitarian reasons, 
it’s for money, they think it 
is a waste of money. But the 
fact that we have the same 
goals makes me hopeful and I 
think in the next five years we 
are going to see a huge differ-
ence.”
Watkins then said people 
are too reliant on the carcer-
al state and should shy away 
from calling the police for 
every minor inconvenience.
“I think part of what we 
have to know is we can’t get 
past the carceral state if we 
can’t see past the carceral 
state,” Watkins said. “All that 
we see in response to conflict 
is ‘I need to call the police.’ 
What do you call the police 
for?”
The event concluded with 
the panelists suggesting con-
crete ways for attendees to get 
involved.
Steinberg told the audience 
to actively question people 
who make comments which 
sustain the flaws in the crimi-
nal justice system.
“I would encourage every-
body to challenge your family, 
your friends if they are saying 
things that help perpetuate 
mass incarceration,” Stein-
berg said. “Whether it is call-
ing the police over something 
that you don’t need to call the 
police, whether it’s wanting 
to lock people up forever, or 
calling people in prison ani-
mals. I think it is incumbent 
upon all of us to challenge 
that.”
LSA freshman Sarah Sukal 
said she attended the event to 
learn more about what she can 
do as a student to help create 
change in the carceral state.
“I want to understand how 
our prison system actually 
works,” Sukal said. “I hadn’t 
really heard of the concept 
of the carceral state before. 
You think about people being 
locked up, but you don’t think 
about what’s actually going on 
inside the prisons, you don’t 
really know what you can 
actually do to help.”

“(They were) hissing and 
booing… screaming ‘ahhh’ and 
yelling,” French said. “(They 
were) trying to drown me out 
from saying this.”
DeSanctis said this story 
teaches people to be tolerant of 
and to react calmly to ideas they 
disagree with because it will 
send a message conservatives 
can tolerate diverse ideas.
“If we are transitioning to 
a model of ‘well, I also should 
try to shut down or mock or 
troll people who I disagree 
with,’ suddenly you’re not 
sending 
the 
message 
that 
conservatives 
can 
tolerate 
dissenting ideas,” DeSanctis 
said. 
“Suddenly 
we’re 
becoming like people on the 
left who don’t want to hear 
the truth… I think it says so 
much that they can’t even hear 
a basic truth… and about the 
weakness of their argument.”
While 
recognizing 
major 
progress 
in 
America, 
they 
agreed toleration of ideas has 
worsened on college campuses.
“I think a lot about why that 
is and one big area where that 

seems to be the case is shutting 
down speakers who come to 
campus and the university 
administrations 
being 
complicit in shutting them 
down,” DeSanctis said.
French said in addition to the 
temptation for conservatives to 
fight back, the Tucker Wars 
began to show the Horseshoe 
theory, or the right and left 
becoming 
more 
alike, 
in 
American politics as populism 
becomes more prevalent.
“Right and left are not 
so 
much 
competing 
over 
fundamental 
ideas 
of 
the 
role of the state as they’re 
trying to compete over who’s 
technocrats 
should 
rule,” 
French said.
Clare Ath, campus outreach 
coordinator for NRI, is not 
a student at Michigan but 
advocates conservative ideas 
on college campuses. She said 
Michigan was the first test-
stop on the podcast tour they 
are launching on the topic of 
civility.
“How 
can 
you 
further 
conservative messaging from 
a point where you’re trying to 
win over the other side, not 
isolate it further from the other 
side?” Ath said.

Ath said that many topics 
discussed were relevant and 
interesting.
“There’s 
a 
difference 
between 
criticism 
and 
censorship,” 
Ath 
said. 
“I 
think people on both sides 
can do a better job of holding 
themselves 
accountable 
to 
the principles they say they 
espouse.”
Engineering junior Conor 
O’Donnell said he found the 
identity perception aspect of 
political discourse to be most 
influential.
“One of the most impactful 
things I learned is the way 
to view political discourse in 
the way that you view who 
you’re speaking to,” O’Donnell 
said. “As opposed to looking 
at 
people 
that 
are 
most 
antagonistic in political debate, 
you want to focus on the people 
that are gonna be the most 
rational and most accepting 
to your ideas because if that’s 
your impression of the people 
who are listening to you, you’re 
more likely to articulate your 
ideas in a more calm, rational 
and intellectual way.”
After the recording finished, 
there was a question and answer 
session open to the audience. 

Some 
topics 
discussed 
were 
religion, 
critique 
vs. 
censorship, abortion and the 
Romney family.
One student asked about 
the distinction between a 
baker refusing to bake a cake 
and a company engaging the 
advancement 
of 
political 
ideas.
“The 
baker 
cases 
and 
florist 
cases 
and 
wedding 
photographer 
cases 
are 
in 
this very specific subset that 
essentially is saying ‘will the 
state use its power to force a 
creative professional to use 
their talents to advance an idea 
they don’t agree with?’” French 
said.
LSA freshman Max Resnick 
said it was interesting to hear 
the idea of both sides feeling 
they are losing the culture war 
because he previously felt like 
the right was more likely to be 
seen as winning.
“But now that I’ve heard that, 
I look around and I see, yeah, 
people do feel like they can’t 
express their opinion because 
of the culture war,” Resnick 
said. “Then, it definitely seems 
to me that the left feels like 
they’re losing the culture war, 
as well.”

PODCAST

LSA 
junior 
Owen 
Hughes 
enrolled in Elementary Arabic I his 
first semester at the University. As a 
new student pursuing mathematics, 
he said studying Arabic gave 
him the opportunity to think 
in ways his other classes didn’t 
allow. Currently, Hughes is taking 
Intermediate Arabic II, the fourth 
course in the sequence focused on 
the Egyptian dialect. Introductory 
Arabic classes, which are housed 
under the Department of Middle 
East Studies, teach formal Arabic in 
conjunction with either Levantine 
or Egyptian dialects. 
Hughes said while it is useful 
to know MSA — Arabic’s formal 
register 
— 
the 
department’s 
structuring of dialects occasionally 
makes it difficult to converse with 
native speakers. 
“During the first year, I spoke like 
four words of colloquial Arabic,” 
Hughes said. “I didn’t know the 
grammar, I knew almost none of 
the vocabulary and we never used it 
in class. So when you go and speak 
it with a native speaker, there are no 
native speakers of formal Arabic— 
they don’t exist.”

Wijdan Alsayegh, a lecturer 
in the Department of Middle 
East Studies, said the debate over 
whether to teach colloquial in 
addition to formal is central to 
Arabic language programs across 
the country.
“This is the essential debate in 
American universities,” Alsayegh 
said. “You are going to find this 
debate in every Arabic program. So 
which one do our students prefer— 
dialect or standard? So it is normal 
and even in (different) countries we 
have this debate. Which one is the 
most important — the dialect or the 
standard?”
Gottfried Hagen, department 
chair of Middle East Studies, 
explained the goal of integrating 
MSA 
with 
dialect 
in 
the 
curriculum is to help students 
achieve proficiency in the Arabic 
language. According to Hagen, 
the mixed curriculum began at 
the University in 2012, with the 
hopes that students would gain the 
skills necessary to speak Arabic in 
real-world environments, where 
speakers often switch between 
MSA and dialect during a single 
conversation.

G

un policy is a delicate 
balancing act. On the one 
hand, optimal gun policy 
is about gun control: regulating 
guns and gun ownership with the 
aim of making society safer. On the 
other hand, reducing the volume 
and lethality of civilian arms 
should not reduce, to the extent 
possible, the capacity of those 
same arms to do good and make 
individuals safer.
An adequate balancing of these 
interests is what American society, 
currently plagued by nearly 100 
firearm fatalities per day, screams 
silently for. As I opined in my 
last column, this balancing is not 
impossible. 
Permit-to-purchase 
laws, which require prospective 
gun buyers to acquire a permit 
from state or local law enforcement 
in addition to passing universal 
background checks, are tried and 
tested. These laws make society 
safer because they ensure that those 
buying guns are qualified to enjoy 
their benefits, rather than targeting 
certain guns or gun attachments. 
However, they, and other laws like 
them, will need to be introduced at 
the state level for their benefits to be 
enjoyed.
For 
any 
staunch 
Second 
Amendment 
supporters 
still 
reading at this point, the main 
grievance with my position is 
almost certainly a constitutional 
one. Ammunition for this defense 
of the Second Amendment is 
often found in the curt opinions 
of 
Supreme 
Court 
Associate 
Justice Clarence Thomas, who 
has launched his own crusade 
against the supposed relegation 
of the Second Amendment “to 
a second-class right” by the 
Court. 
To 
adequately 
protect 
what Thomas terms the Court’s 
“constitutional 
orphan,” 
many 
Second Amendment supporters 
claim that we should disregard all 
gun control regulations but those 
most substantially beneficial to 
public safety and least burdensome 
to individual rights.
Even though applying this strict 
standard to gun laws has scant legal 
precedent, for the sake of argument, 
we can assume that legitimate gun 
control measures have to both 
further a “compelling governmental 
interest” and be narrowly tailored 
to do so. Reasonable people would 
agree that the government has a 
compelling interest in reducing 
firearms deaths. And requiring a 
permit from law enforcement in 
order to obtain a firearm definitely 

qualifies as a narrowly tailored 
measure, in that it entails neither 
an assault weapons ban nor limits 
on magazine capacity – measures 
that arguably reduce the capacity of 
law-abiding gun owners to defend 
themselves. Anyone worried that 
local or state gun registries would 
inevitably lead to the feared “federal 
registry” would do well to review 
the concept of federalism.
As for the efficacy of permit-
to-purchase laws, I am confident 
that even die-hards such as Justice 
Thomas would be satisfied. A study 
published four years ago detailed 
how Connecticut’s 1995 permit-
to-purchase laws were correlated 
with a significant decline in 
firearm homicides.
Another found strong evidence 
that Missouri’s repeal of its own 
permit-to-purchase law in 2007 
led to increased gun violence. Yet 
another study supported these 
findings. In 2015, the Court denied 
certiorari, an order in which a 
higher court reviews the decision 
of a lower court, to an appeal 
of a local-level assault weapons 
ban, and Thomas dissented by 
noting that if a broad ban on 
firearms can be upheld based on 
conjecture that the public might 
feel safer (while being no safer at 
all), then the Second Amendment 
guarantees nothing.” Permit-to-
purchase laws not only stop short 
of broadly banning firearms, but 
demonstrably make the public 
safer as well.
So why do federal efforts 
to enact much more restrained 
measures flounder, such as the 
recent 
Democratic-led 
bills 
expanding 
background 
checks 
to nearly all firearms transfers? 
There’s a lot of lying, of course. 
Graced by frequent support from 
the president himself, the National 
Rifle Association has used its 
platform to persuade Americans 
that universal background checks 
will “make it harder for good 
people to defend themselves and 
their families.” Keep in mind, 
background checks are only meant 
to flag those who shouldn’t own 
guns. How, then, could those same 
checks 
possibly 
inconvenience 
“good” people?
More importantly, perhaps, 
are the institutional dynamics 
halting any chances of success for 
federal gun control measures. High 
numbers of Americans support 
universal 
background 
checks, 
but 
pro-gun 
voters 
prioritize 
halting 
such 
measures 
more 

than pro-gun control voters care 
about passing them. Gun control 
simply isn’t that high of a policy 
priority 
for 
many 
Americans. 
Additionally, 
contemporary 
partisan divides make the Senate 
a disproportionately Republican 
place. When only rural states 
receive a relative advantage in the 
Senate, and rural states are now 
almost 
entirely 
dominated 
by 
Republicans, the result is a Senate 
more conservative than the country 
it represents. It’s no surprise that 
the universal background check 
bill will likely pass in the House but 
not in the Senate.
For these reasons, advocates 
of 
permit-to-purchase 
laws 
should look to the states. Last 
year’s 
midterm 
election 
saw 
Democrats make more gains in 
state legislatures and governorships 
than did Republicans, including in 
several states where gun control 
measures have already been passed 
and met with severe backlash from 
Second Amendment supporters. 
States also passed an increasing 
number of gun control laws after 
the Parkland shooting last year, 
proving correct former Associate 
Justice Louis Brandeis’s assessment 
of 
states 
as 
laboratories 
of 
democracy. Passing gun laws state-
by-state certainly has limitations, 
such as encouraging cross-state 
gun transfers. But the relatively 
homogenous considerations of state 
governments, contrasted with the 
myriad political pressures that 
burden the federal government, 
still make them excellent for 
addressing those problems like gun 
policies that have trouble gathering 
nationwide traction.
I think it’s fitting to end this 
column with the mantra of NRA 
executive vice president Wayne 
LaPierre, who is for many the 
face of pro-gun advocacy: “The 
only thing that stops a bad guy 
with a gun is a good guy with a 
gun.” Yes, Mr. LaPierre, the only 
thing that stops a bad guy with 
a gun is a good guy with a gun 
(that “good guy” usually being a 
trained law enforcement officer, 
or several, with the requisite force 
to overcome an attacker). But 
wouldn’t we much rather the bad 
guy didn’t have a gun in the first 
place? The best way to do that, as 
of now, is with permit-to-purchase 
laws. We have every reason to 
lobby for their passage. But it’s a 
task best left to the states.

The world of my dreams is all green
A

fter I return to my 
dorm after a stressful 
day 
of 
classes 
and 
schoolwork, I retreat to a place 
that is always there for me to 
de-stress: 
the 
Arboretum. 
From my vantage point, I 
watch the sky go from blue 
to orange to purple as I visit 
the highest point of the Arb 
around dinner time. It truly 
works wonders for my mental 
health, at least on a day-to-day 
basis. Even so, I often wonder 
about 
the 
real 
advantages 
these green spaces have for us 
and if they improve the quality 
of our response to climate 
change.
Experiencing the benefits 
of green space first hand 
truly feels like a blessing. Our 
psychological 
connections 
with nature are some of the 
most habitual and necessary 
ones that we make, so it 
makes sense why our brains 
are tailored to essentially feel 
revived by plant life. Since 
the establishment of the Arb 
in 1907, the University of 
Michigan has been able to 
shape this green space into a 
place for many uses, including 
exercising, 
leisure 
and 
studying the local ecosystem.
Various 
directors 
have 
led incremental initiatives to 
expand the property of the Arb 
and utilize it for its topography 
and biodiversity. Among many 
initiatives, a few of the most 
important 
strategies 
span 
from maintaining the natural 
beauty of the topographical 
features and vegetation since 
1916 to creating multicultural 
and 
intersectional 
art 
installations in 2000. As a 
result, it’s clear our green 
spaces in Ann Arbor, such 
as the Arb and the Matthaei 
Botanical 
Gardens, 
have 
been developed in such a way 
that we are able to establish 
an 
important 
emotional 
connection with our local 
landscapes. While there are 
personal benefits to creating 
a 
meaningful 
relationship 
with 
nature, 
it’s 
easy 
to 

think that experiencing the 
natural environment without 
tampering with it benefits the 
green space.
On a broader scale, I’m 
curious to explore if the 
devastation that our world 
faces today is a result of 
the 
human 
population 
maintaining and creating less 
green space. At the same time, 
I believe there is a possibility 
that 
large 
green 
spaces, 
whether they be natural or 
urban, may not necessarily be 
a counteracting force against 
climate change. Essentially, 
the 
largest 
contributor 
to 
rising temperatures causing 
climate change is the emission 
of greenhouse gases, mainly 
carbon, from industrialized 
areas. Since cities are the most 
concentrated 
industrialized 
areas of our modern society, 
initiatives attempt to reduce 
the urban heat island effect 
and make large metropolitan 
areas less of a hot spot.

Even so, at the deliberate 
rate that the greening of cities 
is occurring, these initiatives 
are not enough to completely 
offset the level of heating that 
occurs with the emission of 
greenhouse gases at street 
level. This large-scale struggle 
is expanded on by Franco 
Montalto, a civil engineering 
professor at Drexel University, 
discussing the Javits Center 
in New York City: “Green 
infrastructure can help to 
mitigate the heat island effect, 
but local factors will determine 
by how much, and widespread 
greening of the city is going 

to be required to generate 
significant improvements at 
the urban scale.”
Though many of us, myself 
included, relish in the personal 
benefits of having accessibility 
to a massive green space like 
the Arb, we have to consider the 
fact that more should be done 
to improve the quality of the 
environment and public health. 
In other words, it’s not enough 
for the University to provide 
this green space as both a 
conservation of nature and a 
method of self-rehabilitation: 
We should be doing more 
to restore the quality of our 
environment and mend public 
health in the process.
Providing a cleaner, more 
regulated 
environment 
by 
creating green infrastructure 
in addition to green spaces 
should be the method that this 
city and the University uses to 
improve the quality of life of its 
inhabitants. As we have seen, 
there is a strong correlation 
between poor public health, 
both mental and physical, and 
the urgency of a changing 
climate. Furthermore, I urge 
the University to invest in 
methods 
that 
mitigate 
the 
negative 
consequences 
that 
Ann Arbor’s industry puts 
upon us and ultimately commit 
to complete carbon neutrality. 
We are grateful for these 
large green spaces that you 
make available to us, but we 
are dreaming of something 
more. I want us to have this 
mentality: Why can’t we have a 
permanent, far-reaching green 
space all around us instead of 
one that is only available for 
some escape? I believe that 
the strongest barrier we face 
in terms of avoiding climate 
change is action, and we need 
the total implementation of 
green spaces, green technology 
and green habits to propagate 
a series of actions that will 
eventually sustain a green 
lifestyle.

I

f a tree falls and no one is 
around to hear it, does it 
still make a sound?
If a girl is sexually assaulted 
and no one tries to stop it, does 
she still matter?
After it happened, I couldn’t 
speak for days. Motionless, I sat 
on my bedroom floor in front 
of a mirror — desolate eyes 
blankly staring at the bruises on 
my body, unable to accept it as 
mine. I often have nightmares in 
which I return to this moment, 
my first examination of the 
damaged goods I had become.
As I restlessly toss and turn 
in bed during these times, my 
mind’s eye first sees my neck 
— a blank canvas one moment, 
painted by a sea of black and 
blue and purple and green the 
next. I will never forget the 
feeling of utter powerlessness, 
when my cries for help were 
met with hands smothering my 
mouth and neck and his words, 
“I know a whore like you wants 
this.”
My gaze travels downward, 
and I see the wrists encircled 
by 
bruising 
and 
abrasions 
unmistakably 
resembling 
silhouettes of human hands. 
Even now, the sound of male 
laughter can send me into 
hysterics. I can’t help but think 
of his housemates’ drunken 
laughter, 
their 
humor 
in 
observing my sober attempts to 
free myself as they held down 
my wrists and waited for their 
turn.
Finally, I look at my face, 
unable to recognize the girl 
staring back at me. At that 
moment, all I feel is shame. 
All I feel is disgust towards 
myself and my body, unable to 

consider myself as anything but 
a filthy object used to the point 
of worthlessness. No number 
of showers or bottles of empty 
mouthwash since that night has 
helped me feel clean again.
This 
recurring 
nightmare 
relentlessly lingers, even now, 
an unwelcome addition to the 
myriad of habits that arose in 
the subsequent months after 
my assault. I secretly developed 
a vice of self- harm, my habit 
of “only” once a week quickly 
turning into “only” once a day, 
a routine that inevitably gave 
way to two, three, maybe even 
four times from the moment 
I woke up until the time my 
eyes fluttered shut at night, my 
body exhausted from wracking 
sobs. I became trapped within 
the jaws of an eating disorder, 
the 25 pounds dropping off my 
already-small frame the closest 
I could come to disappearing 
from this world.
My mind often conceptualizes 
in the form of color, with this 
night being the before and after 
point in the timeline of my life. 
I used to feel kaleidoscopes of 
bright neon shades and swirls 
of pastels. Now, I only see black.
Most of the time, I don’t think 
I deserve the elusive ‘healing’ 
referenced so often by my 
therapist and fellow survivors. 
I even question if I deserve the 
title of ‘survivor’ in reference 
to an experience that I still 
think is my fault. Last year, in 
a place between emptiness and 
devastation, I expressed these 
emotions in the form of a poem:
Is Healing
Feeling like I was physically 
beaten and raped just yesterday?
My absent minded habit of 

stroking the spot on my skull 
that was shoved into a hard 
surface 
before 
my 
‘friend’ 
removed the clothes from my 
dazed body?
The lump in my throat and 
wetness on my cheeks that arise 
just before every interaction 
with my family, my mind yet 
again reminded of the trauma I 
don’t have the courage to tell my 
own mother?
The crippling feelings of self-
blame that prowl around my 
thoughts on an almost hourly 
basis?
‘You shouldn’t have gone to 
his house.’
‘He picked you because he 
knew a girl with a pretty face 
wouldn’t have fallen for his 
kindness.’
‘What did you expect when 
a boy expressed interest in a 
lackluster person like you?’
Though I still don’t have the 
answer to this poem’s question, 
what I do know is that I am 
surrounded by people that will 
hold me up when I am falling to 
my knees, and endlessly radiate 
light into the darkness in my 
mind. For them, I am forever 
grateful. 
They 
have 
been—
and continue to be—integral 
in my path to return not to my 
“old self”, but instead to one 
with improved capacity for 
self-compassion and growth. 
This “new me” will revel in 
floodlights of brilliant hues, 
never letting the events of that 
night define me.

Peters thriving as hitter and leader

Now in her 35th season, 
Michigan softball coach Carol 
Hutchins knows a starter when 
she sees one.
When it came time to tab 
nine of them ahead of the team’s 
opening weekend, Hutchins felt 
ready to go all-in on just three: 
senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield, freshman left fielder 
Lexie Blair and senior center 
fielder Natalie Peters.
It was an open secret that 
Canfield, an All-American last 
season, and Blair, the No. 28 
prospect in the 2018 class, were 
shoo-ins. Peters, on the other 
hand, came into 2019 coming off 
a regression year that followed 
a stellar sophomore campaign. 
After posting a .361 batting 
average en route to second team 
All-Big Ten honors in 2017, 
Peters’ average tumbled by 49 
points to a .312 clip last season.
The beginning of Peters’ 
senior year suggested her best 
days may be in the past. Through 
her first 17 games of 2019, 
she hobbled to a .234 batting 
average across 47 at-bats.
But in the past month, Peters 
has put any questions of whether 
she peaked as a sophomore to 
rest.
“(Peters) has been locked in 
at the plate,” Hutchins said. 
“She’s starting to see herself in 
that role, she seems to be seeing 
herself as an ‘I’m going to get 
this done’ (player).”
Peters has posted six multi-
hit games and a .434 average 
over her last 20 games. She 
played an integral role in last 

weekend’s sweep of Indiana, 
racking up six hits in eight 
at-bats. On Friday, she tallied 
three hits and drove in two of 
Michigan’s four runs before 
scoring a third herself.
After singling, stealing a base 
and drawing a walk in Saturday’s 
game, Peters had herself a series 
finale to remember. She doubled 
in the seventh inning before 
coming around to score on 
senior designated player Kenzie 
Nemitz’s walk-off double.
Peters has spent most of the 
season 
sandwiched 
between 
Canfield and Blair in the two-
hole of Hutchins’ batting order. 
Being wedged between two of 
the country’s most dangerous 
matchups means she doesn’t get 
a lot of attention as a slap hitter, 
but her bat has quietly played 
a major role in the Wolverines’ 
offensive revival. During its 
current 15-game win streak, 
Michigan is averaging nearly 
nine runs per game — a stark 
contrast to the 3.59 runs per 
game it averaged through the 
first five weeks of the season.
By getting on base, Peters 
creates opportunities to drive 
in runs for Blair and senior first 
baseman Alex Sobczak, who 
lead the team with 32 and 25 
RBI, respectively. Though the 
Wolverines sit atop the Big Ten, 
the pressure of being a senior 
as the regular season winds 
down doesn’t faze Peters in the 
slightest.
If anything, it drives her to 
embrace the stage that these 
opportunities provide.
“I’ve worked so hard my 
whole life and now is the time 
when I can just finally play,” 

Peters said. “I’m really not 
trying to think about the fact 
that it’s April. Everything I’m 
working for is for the team, it’s 
not for anybody else.”
Despite her strong numbers 
at the plate, Peters’ impact is 
most felt as a leader. As the only 
senior outfielder on the roster, 
Peters has taken a number of 
younger players under her wing.
Blair has felt the effects 
of Peters’ efforts first-hand, 
particularly on defense. After 
Blair’s fielding error allowed 
the Hoosiers to take a fourth-
inning lead on Sunday, Peters 
was the first player by her side.
Peters reminded her that 
“there was a lot of game left” — 
a sentiment that settled Blair’s 
nerves as Michigan began its 
eventual comeback.
“I truly look up to (Peters),” 
Blair said. “Since day one when 
I stepped on campus, from the 
first practice, I’ve looked up to 
her as a mentor. … She knows 
the ropes around here, she’s 
experienced, and it’s not like 
she doesn’t thinks of herself as 
above everyone, which is what 
I really look up to. She’s poised 
out there, she’s calm, cool and 
collected and she’s a great 
mentor.
“(Peters) is always talking 
to me before every pitch, just 
telling me what to do or where 
to move. Little stuff like that is 
what really helps in the game. 
She gets on me about the details 
to make sure I’m doing what I’m 
supposed to do.”
With the crescendo of her 
career on the horizon, Peters 
has stepped up to the plate both 
as a hitter and leader.

Thome, Munger leave strong legacy

Legacy. What is a legacy?
This question, made famous 
by the hit Broadway musical 
Hamilton, is one that is often asked 
in sports — particularly, it is posed 
in collegiate sports. 
A little over a year ago, the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s all-time leading scorer, 
Katelynn 
Flaherty, 
concluded 
her senior campaign in Waco, TX 
following a second round NCAA 
Tournament defeat to Baylor. Once 
Flaherty’s career as a Wolverine 
ended, two questions followed: 
what is her Michigan legacy and 
what is next for the program?
Now, one year later, those 
questions are beginning to get 
answered 
following 
another 
second-round appearance and the 
emergence of a freshmen class with 
astronomically high potential. 
However, with the impending 
graduation of the Wolverines’ 
two co-captains, seniors Hallie 
Thome and Nicole Munger — two 
other program legends who played 
alongside Flaherty the prior three 
seasons —the same questions are, 
once again, arising. 
To find those answers now, 
one could take a look at stats: 
Thome is the program’s second all-
time leading scorer and Munger 
accumulated over 1000 points after 
starting just her final two seasons. 
Together, the duo led Michigan to 
its first ever back-to-back second 
round Tournament appearances 
and they brought home the 
program’s first banner in the form 
of a WNIT championship.
But, to really understand the 
lasting impact of Thome and 
Munger and what could happen to 
the program upon their departures, 
once must look back to 2014. 
***
From the time Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico began recruiting 
Munger and Thome, she knew they 
were going to be special. 
“They were great and expected 
excellence in everything that they 
did,” Barnes Arico said. “That’s 
what Michigan stands for. So we 
knew that when they came here 
they were different. Different 
kinds of kids with different kinds 
of expectations. And they wanted 
greatness.” 
Before convincing either player 
to come to Michigan, though, 
Barnes Arico had her work cut out 
for her. 
For Munger, a kid from a small 
Philadelphia suburb, the idea of 
playing at Michigan, far from her 
home, was tough. 
“I was always a home body 
growing up. Always,” Munger said. 
“Sleepovers I wouldn’t do, so I was 
always like ‘I’m going to school in 
Philly.’ ” 
But, eventually, Munger ended 
up getting over her early fears 
and committed to play for the 
Wolverines. 
“I knew that Michigan was a 
place that I could never pass up,” 
Munger said. “I mean I walked on 
campus and just got the chills for 
the first time. And it was just the 
place that I wanted to be. … It’s just 
a place that I couldn’t have said no 
to.”
While the Wolverines weren’t 
necessarily on Munger’s mind until 
the recruitment process began, 
for Thome, it was a completely 
different story.
Thome is from the suburbs of 
Cleveland, just a three-hour drive 
away from Ann Arbor. She’s come 
to Michigan for multiple reasons 
ever since she was in seventh grade. 
And while, at first, she wasn’t 
positive Michigan was the place 
for her, after talking with her AAU 
coach, a friend of Barnes Arico, she 

came around. 
“Being 
able 
to 
perform 
athletically and academically at the 
highest level, you can’t really pick 
any place better than Michigan,” 
Thome said. 
***
Once they arrived on campus, 
the two roomed together and 
quickly became friends. 
They did everything together, 
like go to California Pizza Kitchen 
at the Briarwood Mall and befriend 
the owners. 
The only time the pair really 
weren’t connected at the hip was 
on the court during game time. 
“I thought I would start, maybe,” 
Thome said. “And then if I started I 
would play a few minutes and that 
would probably be it.” 
Thome 
ended 
up 
starting 
every game her freshman season 
and averaged about 25 minutes 
per game. Munger, on the other 
hand, was put into a much more 
minimal role, starting only once 
and averaging just over 12 minutes 
per game.
Even though Munger did not 
have played as much as she may 
have liked, Barnes Arico still holds 
that she was beloved by all.
“She was a fan favorite from the 
first time we put her in a game her 
freshman year and she was the 
front of the press,” Barnes Arico 
said. “And you wonder who was 
up there in the front (of the press) 
before (freshman forward) Naz 
(Hillmon)? It was Nicole.” 
Their freshmen year ultimately 
concluded in a loss in the semifinals 
of the WNIT. 
The next year, with both playing 
in bigger roles, the Wolverines yet 
again failed to qualify for the Big 
Dance and instead again went to 
the WNIT, despite a 28-9 record 
and a third-place finish in the Big 
Ten.
This time, though, they helped 
Michigan win it.
“We hung the first banner, so 
it’s definitely an accomplishment,” 
Thome said. “And I remember 
coach saying the freshmen, at 
that time, went up to her and said, 
‘We’re going to hang another one.’ ”
That 
championship 
came 
directly in the middle of Munger 
and Thome’s stay in Ann Arbor 
— and also helped create a shift in 
program expectations. 
“The (culture) when we came in 
was like, “Let’s have a postseason,’ 
” Thome said. “… Now it’s time to 
show everyone why we think, no 
matter what we do, we should be 
able to continue our season more 
than one or two games. It’s more 
(than) being happy we’re in the 
Tournament. (It’s) being happy 
we’re winning games.” 
*** 
In their junior years, Munger and 
Thome made large contributions 
to Michigan’s first tournament 
team in five years. Munger’s hard 
work finally paid off and she joined 
Thome in the starting lineup. 
And while both Munger and 
Thome knew that they were in 
supporting roles in the Flaherty 
show, they both averaged career 
highs in points (9.1 points per 
game and 17.4 points per game, 
respectively) and rebounds (4.4 
rebounds per game and 7 rebounds 
per game, respectively) — although 
Munger would increase her points 
per game mark in her senior season.
Following their junior seasons, 
it was finally Munger and Thome’s 
time to take over the reins of the 
program and assert themselves as 
team leaders. 
“When we first got our team 
together this summer, I just knew 
how excited I was,” Munger said. 
“This group was a really special 
group because we knew we had 
each other. … And we knew that we 
were missing a lot, but at the end of 

the day we still had so much.” 
At that first team meeting over 
the summer, Munger and Thome 
met with their new freshmen. 
Munger expected their first 
practice with the new players to be 
somewhat laid back and relaxing. 
The captain, the consensus hardest 
worker on the team, Munger 
expected to be the one who went 
abnormally hard and led the 
workout. Instead, the freshmen 
came out with a fire Munger hadn’t 
seen before. 
“They came in and ran this 
workout and I was dripping sweat,” 
Munger said. “They were doing 
each throwing drill, going back and 
forth with each other. And there 
was no competitiveness, which 
there usually is when freshmen 
come in because they’re trying to 
prove themselves to each other and 
see which one’s the best. They were 
just trying to get better.”
But that’s just a testament to 
what Munger and Thome’s senior 
campaigns looked like. There was 
no sense of entitlement or feeling 
of superiority felt among the 
co-captains over the rest of the 
time. Even when the co-captains 
received All-Big Ten honors, they 
did not allow it to go to their heads. 
That, in part, is due to Munger 
and Thome’s personalities, as well 
as the sense of sisterhood instilled 
within the program — a sisterhood 
Munger 
and 
Thome 
prided 
themselves on continuing.
“I think we’ve always been 
such a tight group over the years 
and we’ve always called each 
other sisters and bridesmaids 
and all that,” Thome said. “But I 
think to become a senior, and to 
see it all happening and to see the 
relationships being formed … I 
think it’s definitely a cool thing to 
see.”
That sense of sisterhood became 

especially important during the 
team’s early season struggles.
After starting out 3-6 in the Big 
Ten, things were not looking great 
for the Wolverines. It was left up to 
the senior co-captains to try to turn 
the tide in their final season. 
And while Thome and Munger 
could have taken a step back and 
allowed the season to spiral out of 
control, neither was willing to give 
up on their goal of making it back to 
the NCAA Tournament or throw 
away their last year at Michigan. 
“This January and February 
were a favorite part (of the season) 
of mine,” Munger said. “Everyone 
counted us out and I think it was 
just part of a defining moment 
where this program could have 
sunk this year and said to hell with 
it, but they followed our grit and 
our desire to make the tournament. 
“We got it done and that was 
really special to me.”
*** 
Now, with their senior seasons 
over, Munger and Thome finally 
have some free time on their hands 
to reflect on the last four years and 
do as they please for their final few 
weeks.
Munger continues to work out 
at the team’s facilities, decked out 
in Michigan gear, mulling over her 
future plans. She hopes to become a 
graduate assistant and, eventually, 
a coach. 
Thome, meanwhile, has taken 
the 
opposite 
approach. 
She’s 
spent her time at the public, 
university gyms — the North 
Campus Recreational Building to 
be specific. She’s distanced herself 
from the game a little bit more 
than Munger and has a summer 
internship in Chicago working for 
Nike before potentially taking a job 
in Fort Myers, FL.

In a rarity for baseball, both 
teams were racing against the 
clock.
With a five-and-a-half hour 
drive back to Terre Haute, 
Ind. ahead of Indiana State 
on Wednesday evening, even 
the possibility of a shortened 
seven-inning 
game 
wasn’t 
enough to risk pushing up 
against 
their 
prearranged 
7:30 travel curfew. Coming off 
yesterday’s 
hard-fought 
8-7 
loss — only its second home 
loss of the year — the Michigan 
baseball 
team 
managed 
to 
hold its lead despite a worthy 
challenge from the Sycamores 
to hang on and win, 6-4.
“Indiana State is a savvy, 
quality team,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “They don’t 
get rattled, they play well on 
the road, they’re a good and 
complete team. We knew we 
had our work cut out for us.”
A sluggish start to the game 
for both teams was highlighted 
by a solo home run fired over 
right 
field 
by 
sophomore 
outfielder Jesse Franklin in 
his first at-bat of the game 
— 
exactly 
what 
happened 
in Sunday’s 8-0 win against 
Minnesota.
With 
Michigan 
leading 
2-0 in the top of the third, 
Indiana 
State 
momentarily 
threatened to tie the game 
up after starting left-hander 
Angelo 
Smith 
walked 
two 
batters in a row. That threat 
was quickly extinguished as 
the Sycamores’ Romero Harris 
hit a grounder which Michigan 
turned into a 6-4-3 double play. 
“They probably feel like 
they 
had 
multiple 
scoring 
opportunities in the first three 
innings 
that 
they 
couldn’t 
capitalize on or we stopped,” 
Bakich said. “Angelo (Smith) 
pitched us out of some big jams 
as well.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 
picked up in the bottom of the 
inning. Singles from Kerr and 
Blomgren sent two runners 
home while freshman first 

baseman Jack Van Remortel 
scored on a passed ball.
Sophomore 
catcher 
Harrison Salter, who started 
over sophomore Joe Donovan, 
dropped a sacrifice bunt in a 
squeeze play to send senior 
Ako Thomas home and widen 
Michigan’s lead to 6-0. Salter, 
who has had limited playing 
time so far this season, had 
made his mark on the game 
with a sacrifice fly in the 
bottom of the second that 
scored Blomgren.
“Those 
hits 
felt 
great,” 
Salter 
said. 
“We work a lot 
on 
situational 
stuff, and while 
the team gives 
me 
crap 
for 
being 
such 
a 
good 
bunter, 
we 
ended 
up 
needing it.”
After 
a 
lightning-fast fourth inning 
with 1-2-3 frames for both 
teams, Indiana State found its 
offense in the top of the fifth 
and managed two runs from 
singles, marking junior right-

hander Jack Weisenburger’s 
first conceded runs of the 
season. 
It seemed initially as though 
the Wolverines would contain 
the Sycamores’ offense in the 
sixth. But with two outs and 
the bases loaded, a single to 
center field from Jake Means 
notched Indiana State another 
two runs to narrow the score 
to 6-4.
“We knew even up six that 
they weren’t going to go away 
quietly,” Bakich said. “Today 
was shaping up 
to be very much 
like 
yesterday 
if 
it 
weren’t 
for the travel 
curfew.”
With 
the 
clock 
relentlessly 
ticking toward 
the 
7:30 
deadline, 
the 
Sycamores were 
unable to capitalize on this 
momentum. To allow Indiana 
State to get on the road, the 
game was ended after the sixth 
inning, 
and 
Michigan 
was 
saved by the bell.

Baseball is a long game. Nine 
innings; three-plus hours; three, 
four or even five days a week, 
come rain, shine, or even snow 
– a legitimate possibility in Ann 
Arbor, even in April. 
The time has arrived in the 
Michigan baseball team’s season 
when its demanding schedule 
is starting to take a toll on the 
players’ bodies. It’s not uncommon 
for players to sit out a midweek 
game to rest up for a big weekend. 
On Wednesday against Indiana 
State, it was sophomore catcher 
Joe Donovan who was scratched 
in favor of redshirt sophomore 
catcher Harrison Salter ahead of 
a big weekend series at arch-rival 
Ohio State in Columbus.
Salter ended up making the 
most of the opportunity for the 
Wolverines. He notched a single 
and two RBI on a sacrifice fly and 
a sacrifice bunt as well as a solid 
performance behind the plate 
in No. 24 Michigan’s 6-4 victory 
over the Sycamores.
“I was really excited. It’s 
always great to come out here 
and get the start,” Salter said. 

“It’s always an honor to come out 
and do my part and continue our 
legacy here this season.”
Salter has served this sort of fill-
in role all year for the Wolverines. 
He’s 
started 
games 
against 
California 
State 
University-
Northridge, Manhattan, Western 
Michigan and San Jose State – the 
last two also coming in the middle 
of the week – as well as coming 
off the bench in games against 
Binghamton and Michigan State 
over the course of the season. 
He’s hitting for a respectable 
.267 batting average over his nine 
games this season with five hits 
and five RBI. Wednesday was 
his biggest day so far this season, 
though. His two RBI helped build 
Michigan’s momentum in what 
ended up being a tight game to 
close a midweek series against the 
Sycamores.
“Today was just great,” Salter 
said, grinning. “We work a lot on 

situational stuff. People on the 
team always give me crap for being 
a good bunter, but it always comes 
in handy when you need it during 
games.” 
Clutch hitting like Salter’s 
has 
become 
an 
increasingly 
important part of Michigan’s 
success recently. Four of their 
last five games have been decided 
by a margin of two runs or fewer. 
Against tough teams like Indiana 
State, which, like Michigan, has 
been in and out of the rankings 
over the course of the season, a 
hit here or there can make all the 
difference.
“We had our work cut out for 
us,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “They’re a very complete 
team. We knew even up six, they 
weren’t going to go away quietly. 
We were two very evenly-matched 
clubs. It’s whoever gets that one 
extra hit or makes that one extra 
play wins the game.”

A tale of two seniors: The story of Emma McLean and Olivia Karas

It all started in the summer of 
2013. 
Emma McLean, a rising high 
school junior, was spending 
a beautiful day on a boat in 
northern Michigan. Her phone 
rang, the screen flashed the name 
“Olivia Karas.” She answered. 
“I 
just 
committed 
to 
Michigan!!” said the girl on the 
other end.
And just like that, McLean had 
her future Michigan women’s 
gymnastics counterpart, and a 
dynamic duo was born.
Right off the bat, the two 
became 
immensely 
close. 
Like, 
finishing-each-other’s-
sentences 
close, 
so 
it’s 
no 
surprise that McLean and Karas 
spent all of their time together 
trying to figure out the game 
called life. There were times 
when they would miss the 
bus and chase after it so they 
wouldn’t be late to practice, or 
would miss dinner and would 
eat dry cereal on McLean’s dorm 
room floor. 
“I think that coming in as 
a 
two-person 
class, 
you’re 
kinda 
automatically 
bonded 
and put through everything 
together,” Karas said. “Which 
I think we both liked. I think 
we have similar but different 
personalities, so we complement 
each other nicely. I think you 
get tossed into this environment 
with just one other person and 
we just kinda —
“…We just kinda have to figure 
it out,” finished McLean. “That’s 
something that’s important to 
explain to every freshman class. 
Like, 
there’s 
no 
guidebook, 
there’s no handbook, no one’s 
there to hold your hand and tell 
you what college is going to be 
like. Nothing prepares you for it. 
And I think having to figure that 
out with each other really just 
forms that bond.”
As the lone two newcomers 
on 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics team when they 

arrived, 
the 
adjustment, 
unsurprisingly, 
was 
difficult. 
However, they always knew that 
they had a strong, loving team as 
their backbone. And they used 
that fortitude to make sure that 
everyone else that came in had 
that same secure, cherished 
feeling. 
“I think that when we were 
freshmen, we did get that love,” 
Karas said. “And we were kinda 
taken in as the babies that 
everyone really did love. And we 
got that affection right off the 
bat.
“But some people didn’t … 
so I think for the two of us, we 
saw that, and were like, ‘There’s 
no more of this (feeling of 
exclusion). This is how it goes. 
This is how we’re going to do it.’ 
It’s taking everyone under your 
wing, appreciating everyone … 
there’s no hierarchy.”
Using that inclusive mentality, 
McLean and Karas have taken 
their experiences and tenure 
to create a lead-by-example 
mindset for the rest of the 
team. That means going up to a 
teammate before they are about 
to compete and giving words 
of encouragement or cheering 
as loud as they can from the 
side because they know it’s that 
teammate’s personal preference. 
It means knowing that everyone 
is different, and accepting and 
utilizing those differences to 
bring the team 
closer together. 
“It 
means 
being…,” 
Karas 
started.
“Balanced,” 
McLean said.
Karas smiled. 
“Exactly.”
It’s 
not 
just 
the 
love 
that 
brings the team 
together. It’s the 
fact that, going 
into 
national 
championship 
weekend, they have so much still 
to prove. 
“Personally, 
I 
think 
I’m 
looking forward to just shocking 

everyone,” McLean said. “And 
I think, something that I know 
Michigan says — I think it was 
the basketball team that used 
it a long time ago — ‘Shock the 
world.’ That kind of thing.”
But the best part about being a 
leader is learning, too. 
“You 
learn 
more 
every 
single year that 
you’re here, and 
your senior year, 
you 
kinda 
put 
it all together,” 
McLean 
said. 
“And you’re like, 
‘This is why.’ And 
I think this year, 
(Michigan coach) 
Bev 
(Plocki) 
has helped me 
learn that when we believe in 
ourselves, the sky is the limit. 
And I think going through 
adversity and never giving up 
really brings it full circle.”

Karas agreed and reminisced 
about 
how 
last 
year, 
she 
questioned whether she even 
wanted to try to ever do a 
floor routine after tearing her 
Achilles. She remembers the 
work, the frustration, but the 
ultimate realization of why she’s 
here shone through.
“This year is definitely my 
‘why,’ ” Karas said. “Because of 
this group, this team, what we’ve 
accomplished so far, and what 
we will accomplish.”
Since that day in that summer 
of 2013, Karas and McLean have 
rebounded from injury, learned 
countless 
lessons, 
developed 
incredible skills, and grown 
tremendously 
as 
teammates, 
housemates, leaders, and friends. 
And now, as seniors, going into 
their final weekend competing 
in the maize and blue, they’ve 
taken time to reflect on their 
years in Ann Arbor. 
“I would definitely thank this 

whole University for the pride in 
Michigan,” Karas said.“I think 
once you get here, there is an 
automatic ‘We are Michigan, we 
bleed maize and blue, we’re the 
leaders and best.’ And I think 
that’s ingrained in everyone, 
athlete or not.” 
Added 
McLean: 
“Walking 
around 
on 
campus, 
where 
else would you 
rather be? I don’t 
think 
there’s 
anywhere that’s 
better. 
The 
experience as a 
whole has been 
great, and well-
rounded. It’s just 
been the best. From the second 
I got on campus freshman year, 
I’ve loved every second.”
So, what next?
Standing in sweatpants before 

conditioning in the Donald R. 
Shepherd Women’s Gymnastics 
Training Center for one of the 
last times ever, reminiscing 
on the times they’ve had at 
Michigan and together, the duo 
looked at each other and laughed.
“I think it’s going to be 
interesting 
experiencing life 
without a sport 
in a few weeks, 
but we’ll figure it 
out,” Karas said. 
“Like we always 
do.”
“That’s 
literally 
our 
thing,” 
McLean 
said. “We don’t 
know what the 
hell we’re doing, 
but we’ll figure it out. like we 
have so far … There’s never a dull 
moment.”
Karas laughed, and repeated:
“Never a dull moment.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Virgil Abloh has become one of 
the biggest names in the modern 
fashion world, and not for a lack of 
effort. He started his career as a 
creative director for Kanye West, 
directing for albums like 808s 
And Heartbreak, My Beautiful 
Dark Twisted Fantasy and Watch 
the Throne. A few years after 
interning at Fendi in 2009, he 
began designing his own clothes, 
starting two brands that would 
in turn lead him to creatively 
direct another big firm. His third 
was one of the biggest brands in 
the world. From Pyrex Vision to 
OFF-WHITE to Louis Vuitton, 
Abloh started with a vision and 
saw it through each step of the 
way.
Abloh started Pyrex Vision 
in late 2012, launching the 
first collection at RSVP, the 
Chicago boutique he opened 
with designer Don C a few 
years earlier. The idea behind 
Pyrex Vision was simple: Take 
regular Ralph Lauren flannels 
and Champion garments, screen 
print a number and a logo on 
the back and sell it for hundreds 
of dollars above the price it 
originally sold for (the Ralph/
Pyrex flannel retailed for $550). 
Call it what you want, but with 
Abloh’s vision and the support 
of Kanye West, A$AP Rocky and 
others that called themselves the 
“#been#trill” crew, Pyrex Vision 
started a cultural revolution 
within streetwear that would 
continue on with Abloh’s legacy.
With Pyrex Vision selling out 

on nearly every release, Abloh 
was able to shelf the brand for his 
bigger and still active brand OFF-
WHITE. The first collection 
launched 
for 
Spring/Summer 
2014, and with this brand, Abloh 
told Style.com that his goal was 
to “merge street sensibilities in 
a proper fashion context.” In 
the years since this first launch, 
OFF-WHITE has done exactly 
that and plenty more, achieving 
the perfect balance between the 
pinnacle of streetwear within 
the youth while selling at nearly 
every luxury retailer next to 
fashion giants like Gucci, Celine 
and Louis Vuitton.
OFF-WHITE not only has 
given Abloh the opportunity 
to showcase more of his vision, 
but has led him to collaborate 
with almost every corner of the 
industry. Just in the past two 
years he released OFF-WHITE 
suitcases 
with 
RIMOWA, 
launched an art exhibit with 
Takashi 
Murakami, 
designed 
merch for Kids See Ghosts 
and Travis Scott and released 
an entire rug collection with 
IKEA, all while DJing shows at 
Lollapalooza, 
ASTROWORLD 
and Camp Flog Gnaw. Among 
these collaborations is one of 
the biggest launches he’s had at 
this point in his career: “The 10” 
sneaker collection released with 
Nike. Abloh and OFF-WHITE 
brought Nike their first must-
need sneaker since the death 
of the Air Jordan Retro (queue 
“Facts (Charlie Heat Version)” by 
Kanye West). 10 pairs of sneakers, 
nine of which released within 
a two-hour span, that became 
nearly impossible to purchase 

with all the hype surrounding 
the release. The coveted sneakers 
can now be found selling on 
Stockx for a lovely price of $1,150 
and solidified Abloh’s place as one 
of the biggest icons of modern 
streetwear.
At that point, Virgil Abloh 
had nearly reached the top of 
the fashion Mount Olympus. The 
only thing left to bring him up 
was his appointment as creative 
director of Louis Vuitton. The 
announcement of Kim Jones’s 
replacement broke the internet, 
and nearly every celebrity ran to 
Instagram to congratulate him. 
His first show included a rainbow 
runway the length of the Palais 
Royale Gardens, vibrant baggy 
clothes modeled by none other 
than Kid Cudi and Playboi Carti 
and ended with a tearful hug 
with his former Fendi co-intern 
Kanye West. Abloh certainly did 
not disappoint the viewers of 
his Spring/Summer 2019 show, 
especially with this keep-all 
bag that stole every eye in the 
vicinity.
With 
the 
continuation 
of 
OFF-WHITE, more incredible 
Louis Vuitton handbags (see 
the glow) and all of the random 
collaborations that make him so 
great, Virgil Abloh isn’t going 
anywhere. With each coming 
year, more people assume he’s 
reached his peak and with each 
year he surpasses the last. One 
of the leaders of the Instagram 
generation and the new king of 
luxury, Abloh will continue to 
be the most talked about figures 
of our time. Let’s just hope he 
can still make time to premiere 
unreleased music at his DJ sets.

Virgil Abloh’s three brands
that are moving to the top

LOUIS HAMATI
For The Daily

There 
is 
nothing 
more 
comforting than a triad of 
notes, hanging in the air. 
It seems perfect, like the 
combination of three fingers 
pressing 
three 
keys 
was 
always meant to be. The root 
note rounds out a floating 
base, the second, a filler, the 
third, a cherry on top.
In pop music, the natural 
ease of triads comes easy and 
quick. If you listen to anything 
currently on the top 40 radio 
charts, I bet you that there is an 
obvious triad of notes hiding 
somewhere in the chorus. 
Even more specifically, The 
Chainsmokers have really run 
with this basic musical theory 
into the seemingly never-
ending sunset, and I will 
never get “baby pull me closer 
in the back seat of your Rover” 
out of my head. It’s not by 
choice, trust me. The human 
brain just loves the sound of 
threes, no matter how cliché 
they may be in music — it’s 
truly the original earworm.
My interest, however, is 
not with The Chainsmokers 
— it is in the breakdown and 
power of those chords the 
band has built a pop empire 
upon. The EDM duo is not 
alone in this hack of the music 

industry’s machine: Sia has 
written the majority of her 
songs in less than 15 minutes, 
so did Amy Winehouse, and 
for the love of God, listen to 
the pre-Revolver Beatles once 
and a while and try to find a 
progression that you couldn’t 
make up just sitting at the 
piano for fun. Instrumental 
aficionados 
and 
beginners 
alike are familiar with the 
range 
that 
understanding 
chords can give you alone, 
without any real idea of the 
notes that are inside of them. 
They just sound good, like 
you’ve discovered something 
completely new and perfect 
despite their age-old history.
And in that natural feel 
comes the magic of chords. 
The frustration of learning a 
new instrument is soon offset 
by the excitement of creating 
something with your own 
hands, something that sounds 
fantastic and offers you a new 
realm of possibilities. They’re 
an accessible way to start 
playing, and a comfortable 
ending point for those who 
don’t want to go down the 
long and winding path that 
is music theory. I personally 
wouldn’t 
consider 
myself 
a virtuoso, but I learned 
piano 
and 
guitar 
through 
chords and can survive on 
that alone. Some of the most 
talented songwriters followed 

basic 
chord 
progressions, 
eschewing complex melodies 
for 
the 
innate 
beauty 
of 
simplicity. There’s a reason 
Bob Dylan’s “Knockin’ On 
Heaven’s Door” is often one 
of the first songs that people 
learning guitar pick up: G, D, 
A minor and C are all three-
pronged 
chords, 
an 
easy 
starting place from which to 
learn more.
The 
ubiquity 
of 
triadic 
chords in popular music does 
not devalue them. In fact, 
their 
commonality 
makes 
them an even more important 
skill in the process of learning 
an instrument. They’re the 
base that jam sessions are 
born out of, that songwriting 
begins with, that campfire 
singing picks up from. When 
you learn the basics, you open 
a whole world to explore, 
one that most other people 
are familiar with. With the 
first chord you figure out, 
your fingers shaking over the 
three strings, the three keys, 
the three notes in the air, 
you finally have the ability to 
connect with all of the music 
that’s ever been written. It 
seems dramatic, but it’s true. 
Chords are the framework of 
every song structure, the floor 
on which a melody dances. If 
you can sing, all you need is 
a handful of notes and you’re 
golden. Especially three.

B-SIDE: MUSIC

From a genetic standpoint, 
every 
living 
organism 
is 
a composite of billions of 
combinations 
of 
activated 
and deactivated genes. And 
these genes, facilitated over 
millennia of evolution, is 
what leads you to be you and 
me to be me. In that sense, we 
are all just manifestations 
of the linkages between our 
individual, evolved genetic 
makeup. The key features 
that make us who we are are 
linked in some way, some 
connect-the-dot biology that 
manifests into a walking, 
living 
human. 
The 
same 
way 
that 
an 
individual’s 
particular 
traits 
interact 
with one another to build 
that individual, a city’s key 
features link together to build 
that city’s identity. It is this 
capacity for social linkage 
that makes Philadelphia the 
City of Brotherly Love, that 
makes Columbus the mound 
of garbage that it is and that 
makes Ann Arbor the home 
of the Wolverines.
Most 
people 
see 
Ann 
Arbor 
as 
a 
scattered 
plot 
of 
bizarrely-angled 
intersections 
of 
one-
way streets and four-lane 
throughways dotted with a 
blend of ancient and modern 
buildings 
with 
no 
real 
definite 
organization, 
but 
in reality, the city focuses 
around a very defined track. 
The most popular and well-

known parts of Ann Arbor 
and the University can be 
found along a single, thought-
out pathway, guiding one 
through 
the 
city’s 
most 
important features.
Through research, I have 
identified 
this 
pathway 
as taking the shape of the 
number three, starting at 
Zingerman’s in Kerrytown 
and ending at the Big House. 
By 
drawing 
the 
number 
three on a map of Ann 
Arbor, one can discover the 
mathematically-aligned 
key features of the city that 
make it the Ann Arbor we all 
know and love.
We start with the top 
left tip of the three at 
Zingerman’s in Kerrytown, 
home 
of 
the 
greatest 
sandwiches that Ann Arbor 
has to offer. Though not 
frequented quite as much by 
undergraduates, it is held 
near and dear to the hearts 
of alumni who now have the 
money to pay for its riches.
We 
move 
east 
from 
Kerrytown 
through 
Old 
Fourth Ward, and toe the 
lines 
of 
the 
University’s 
hospital 
forming 
the 
top 
curve of the number. The 
curve 
continues 
along 
Observatory, and cuts into 
the heart of central campus 
before reaching South U, 
forming the central apex 
of the three at The Diag. 
Surrounded by classrooms 
and auditoriums of grand 
performance, the Diag sits 
just 
adjacent 
from 
State 
Street, becoming the cross-

section of almost everything 
Ann Arbor prides itself in: 
World-class teaching, good 
food, artistic appreciation 
and the acknowledgement of 
the University’s storied past, 
highlighted by the forbidden 
M of the class of 1953.
We circle back out under 
the engineering arch and 
clip the fringes of South 
U, just enough to hear the 
hum of Pinball Pete’s and 
shouting 
from 
Charley’s 
and Jug, voices of ghosts 
whose Saturday nights went 
on far too long. The bottom 
curve of the three stretches 
is 
through 
Ross, 
cutting 
diagonally across Packard, 
sharply hooking to the gates 
of the Big House. What 
better place to end the three 
than Michigan Stadium? It is 
the only place where one can 
truly see and feel the brevity 
and depth of Ann Arbor’s 
spiritual effect not only on 
students, alumni and our 
rivals, but also general fans 
of the University and our 
city.
In some strange way of 
social 
and 
geographical 
evolution, the most salient 
features of Ann Arbor that 
bring 
people 
here 
from 
around the world can be 
traced out using the number 
three, 
linking 
the 
city’s 
“genes” that make it the Ann 
Arbor we know and love. 
From Zingerman’s, to The 
Diag, through to the Big 
House, the number three 
outlines Ann Arbor’s places 
to be.

B-SIDE: COMMUNITY CULTURE

They say three is a magic 
number. Every child knows 
that the way to tell a story is 
to have a beginning, a middle 
and an end. At film schools all 
across America, the three-act 
structure is taught like the 
holy gospel, the magical story 
sauce that will make your 
movie compelling. Nowhere 
is this more evident than 
in the all-powerful movie 
trilogy, the holy grail of film 
series lengths.
Of course, modern movie 
franchises have found it hard 
to contain themselves to only 
three movies. As long as part 
three is still bringing in the 
dough, you can be sure that 
parts four and five are not far 
behind. That doesn’t change 
the fact that when people talk 
about the greatest film series 
of all time, they more often 
than not bring up trilogies. 
“Star Wars,” “The Lord of the 
Rings,” ‘Back to the Future,” 
‘Indiana 
Jones,” 
“The 
Matrix,” 
“The 
Godfather,” 
the list goes on and on 
and on. There’s something 
perennially powerful about 
the three-act structure, and 
the trilogy is the three-act 
structure taken to its most 
grandiose state.
The setup is as universal 
as it is simple. The first film 
constructs 
an 
intriguing 
world filled with wonderful 
characters, and provides a 
simple story that seemingly 

resolves 
at 
the 
end, 
but 
leaves room for growth. The 
second film throws a ton 
of 
complications 
into 
the 
mix, adds characters and an 
overarching 
narrative 
and 
ends on a huge cliffhanger. 
The 
third 
one 
wraps 
everything up.
Many of the best “second 
in 
a 
trilogy” 
films 
are 
rightly accused at their time 
of release as being over-
complicated movies that only 
exist to lead into a third movie. 
That’s true, but is that really 
a fair criticism if the movies 
are meant to act as a cycle? 
Would it be fair to complain 
that the second act of a play 
only exists to set up the 
third? Many second chapters 
fair better upon release of 
the third, and audiences can 
see where all this is going. 
Conversely, if the third film 
is bad it can retroactively 
hurt the second one as well. 
“The Empire Strikes Back” 
was controversial when first 
released due to the unfinished 
feeling of its ending, but ever 
since “Return of the Jedi” it 
has been considered the best 
of all the “Star Wars.” On 
the flip side, “Dead Man’s 
Chest” 
and 
“The 
Matrix 
Reloaded” were both hurt 
in the eyes of geek history 
by 
the 
disappointment 
of 
their follow-ups (for what 
it’s worth, I love all three 
“Pirates” films, but I digress).
Of course, sometimes the 
trilogy isn’t allowed to stand 
on 
its 
own. 
“Star 
Wars” 
has all manners of sequels, 

prequels and spin-offs since 
the original trilogy wrapped 
up almost forty years ago. 
“Lord of the Rings” was 
eventually followed by “The 
Hobbit,” 
and 
even 
“Toy 
Story,” which seemingly had 
closed the book as hard as 
it could possibly be closed, 
is coming back this summer 
for a fourth go around. These 
extra movies often hurt the 
perfectly balanced symmetry 
of a trilogy, but in some cases 
they merely restructure the 
original 
story 
in 
context 
of the others. The original 
“Star Wars” movies are now 
the second act in a trilogy of 
trilogies, which for trilogy 
aficionados 
is 
absolutely 
amazing.
Despite 
the 
lack 
of 
traditional 
trilogies 
in 
modern movie making, almost 
anything can be restructured 
into a trilogy if you look 
at it in the right way. “The 
Marvel Cinematic Universe?” 
They’ve got three phases. It’s 
a trilogy. “Harry Potter”? One 
through three are the first 
act, four and five the second 
and six through eight the 
third. It’s a trilogy. College? 
Freshman year is prologue, 
sophomore year is act one, 
junior act two and senior 
year act three. It’s a trilogy. 
Meals? Breakfast, lunch and 
dinner. If you have three 
names, you are a trilogy. The 
three-act structure is the only 
structure, and it is beautiful. 
Internalize that and you will 
never be disappointed in the 
arc of anything ever again.

This shouldn’t be a shock:
People really love trilogies

NBC

The number three is relevant to 
television in a lot of ways. It may 
refer to the number of good seasons 
“Arrested Development” had, or the 
Big Three television networks that 
control the minds of the American 
people. Maybe three alludes to 
the years since the sensational 
Michael 
Schur 
comedy 
“The 
Good Place” came to NBC, or the 
number of facelifts a cast member 
of “The Real Housewives” gets per 
season. Indeed, the number three is 

relevant to television in a myriad of 
ways — none of which I particularly 
care about. What I do care about is 
a “Saturday Night Live” skit from 
2017 titled “Short Film,” because, 
you know, I’m alternative.
“Short Film” is “SNL” at it’s best: 
bizarre, stupid and starring Emily 
Blunt. It takes place in a quaint little 
town called Ann Arbor — yeah, 
we’re about to get pretty meta here. 
Debuting at the Ann Arbor Short 
Film Festival is a short entitled 
“qua,” a thriller featuring Blunt 
and written or produced by literally 
everyone in the theater besides 
one unsuspecting viewer played 

by Vanessa Bayer. Most of what 
happens in the short isn’t relevant. 
What matters is that as Blunt runs 
through a grayscale forest, she is 
surrounded by giant white threes 
peppered throughout the trees and 
shrubbery.
So what do those threes mean? 
When Vanessa Bayer asks that 
same question, none of the cast or 
crew seems to know what she’s 
talking about. “I’m sorry, what 
threes?” Kenan Thompson’s Ann 
Arbor counterpart asks. No one 
else seems to have seen the threes 
Bayer is referring to, leaving all 
parties involved baffled. I, too, was 

confused by this sketch, a standout 
among most “SNL” sketches of date 
that are pitiful attempts at political 
satire. I found myself with three 
main questions: What the hell is 
“qua,” what do those threes mean 
and why did they pick Ann Arbor? 
Three big questions, three tentative 
answers. Let’s dive in.
A quick google search proves my 
vocabulary may not be as extensive 
as I hoped to believe. “Qua” is 
actually an English conjunction, 
dating back to the 15th century 
meaning “in the capacity of” or “as.” 
Used in a sentence: The president 
qua commander-in-chief ordered to 
remove the troops from the Middle 
East. Kind of pretentious, right? A 
20th century usage writer thought 
so, commenting, “Qua is sometimes 
thought affected or pretentious, 
but 
it 
does 
convey 
meaning 
economically.” Sounds like not only 
the description of a word, but of a 
short film that may be shown in a 
town like Ann Arbor. The mystery 
starts to unfold.
But what do those threes mean? 
“Qua” has three letters, is that the 
answer? Probably not, but they have 
to mean something. In my research 

I looked to a chaotically evil place 
for answers: YouTube comments. 
One viewer’s analysis of the short 
in particular stuck out to me as 
incredibly poignant. They claim 
that the short is about a mother 
whose daughter died after she left 
her in the bathtub. She’s in denial 
and running away from herself, 
surrounded by threes, the age of 
which her daughter died. At the end 
of the short when Blunt collapses, 
looks up at a clone of herself and says 
“It’s me,” she’s finally accepting that 
it was she who led to her daughter’s 
death. Quite a deep interpretation of 
a fake short film from an “SNL” skit, 
but not necessarily a bad one. I was 
pretty impressed until I continued 
reading the comment to find the 
final conclusion user Wolf Man 
Lykan came to: “lol jk I’m bored asf.” 
Maybe there never were any threes 
after all.
So why Ann Arbor? Isn’t there 
enough madness going on in this 
sketch that it needn’t be placed in a 
Midwestern bubble? Couldn’t these 
millennial faux-creative types debut 
their passion projects anywhere? 
The answer is no, this sketch 
couldn’t take place anywhere but 

Ann Arbor. Sure, NYC and LA are 
hubs for indie celebrity wannabes, 
but that’s so predictable. Who 
would suspect that a 29-square-
mile town in the south of Michigan 
is filled to the brim with 20-year-
olds convinced that they are God’s 
gift to creative world? That no 
one else gets it like they do? I love 
Ann Arbor, I really do, but part 
of the reason I love her so is that 
every day feels like I’m a part of an 
anthropological study someone is 
conducting “Truman Show”-style 
to see what happens when a bunch 
of people aged 18 to 35 are stuck in 
a Midwestern town with coffee 
shops and craft beers. Have you 
ever been to Literati and just looked 
around? The entire second floor 
coffee shop is full of white men with 
cuffed jeans and women with dyed 
hair freelancing. It’s fascinating, it’s 
marvelous, it’s the exact place “SNL” 
would choose to host an artificial 
short film festival. I may not know 
much about the etymology of the 
word “qua” or what the hell Emily 
Blunt was running from, but I know 
Ann Arbor. She’s a holy trinity of 
pretentious, passion and peculiar 
people — the perfect trifecta.

Three, quas and the great
people of this special town

B-SIDE: TV

Of 
all 
the 
base 
human 
instincts which motivate daily 
lives, 
the 
human 
capacity 
to gossip is both fascinating 
and impressive. Whether it’s 
indulgence in guilty pleasures 
like “The Bachelor” or Star 
Magazine or catching up with 
TMZ and Twitter, everyone 
loves to gossip — those who 
deny it are probably liars. 
They 
are 
probably 
liars 
with “Keeping Up with the 
Kardashians” taped on their 
DVR (after all, who isn’t on the 
edge of their seat with Khloe’s 
cheating 
scandal?). 
And if there’s one 
thing 
people 
love 
to gossip about the 
most, it’s Hollywood. 
When 
it’s 
not 
a 
scandal (again, always 
the 
Kardashians), 
or 
digging 
up 
old 
dirt 
(Brangelina, 
anybody?), the death 
of a star is a supernova 
in the entertainment 
industry. 
Afterall, 
when 
a 
star 
falls, 
everybody knows two 
more are coming this 
way — but who?
Famous 
deadly 
trios 
include 
the 
heartbreaking 
January 
of 
2016, 
where the world lost 
Alan Rickman, David 
Bowie and Glenn Frey, 
the fateful year of 
1970, witnessing the 
fall of Jim Morrison, 
Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, 
and 
more 
notoriously, 
the 
episode of 2009, where Ed 
McMahon, 
Farrah 
Fawcett 
and Michael Jackson passed in 
succession. All of these deaths 
collected in neat trios. It’s no 
wonder the pattern has drawn 
the curiosity of the masses.
It’s the age old “rule of 
three”: When one celebrity 
bites the dust, you can be sure 
that two more will follow. 
If life is unpredictable, then 
the morbid “Rule of Three” is 
seemingly the only constant 
in life. But where does this 
Hollywood myth come from? 
Maybe it’s because “three” 
is a lucky number. Maybe it’s 

mere 
coincidence 
inflated 
by old-fashioned journalism. 
Or maybe there’s a secret 
celebrity cult where stars sign 
their name in the book of the 
Dark Lord (In “The Chilling 
Adventures of Sabrina”-esque 
fashion) in exchange for fame 
(talent being optional — looking 
at you, Mr. Cage). Regardless, 
Hollywood’s “rule of three,” 
however ludicrous, has by great 
coincidence, 
luck 
or 
grand 
design withstood the test of 
time to become one of the 
most well-known and (oddly) 
cherished superstitions. 
Where do we begin the 
search for answers? It could be 
a religious thing — the focus on 
the number three harkening 

back to the holy significance of 
the number in Christianity: The 
Three Kings; the Father, the 
Son and the Holy Spirit; the list 
goes on. Could this pattern have 
emerged from the unconscious 
connection between death and 
religion? For the pious, death 
and religion are intricately 
intertwined. Could it be that 
the death of these larger-than-
life individuals is so jarring, so 
heartbreaking, that the masses 
could only turn to religion for 
solace? 
Another possibility is the 
existence of a secret, dark 
underbelly 
to 
Hollywood. 
Every so often news breaks of 
secret cults, orgies or gambling 

rings within the famous elite. 
The Church of Scientology 
alone has always been a point 
of fervent enthrallment for the 
rest of world, with its “hush-
hush” secrecy and high profile 
drama (Recall the supposed 
Tom Cruise wife auditions). 
It wouldn’t be a stretch to 
imagine that kings and queens 
of Hollywood blockbusters pass 
around a medieval-style goblet 
filled with expensive red wine 
(or the blood of unfortunate 
B-listers?) 
and 
chant 
holy 
prayers to invoke the powers 
of Apollo or the ancient Greek 
Muses. 
Or, more heartwarmingly, 
the 
answer 
could 
lie 
in 
how 
intimately 
these 
stars 
penetrate our daily 
lives. 
Celebrities 
are often household 
names, held near and 
dear to our hearts. 
The deaths of Buddy 
Holly, Ritchie Valens 
and Big Bopper J.P. 
Richardson in 1959 
became known as The 
Day the Music Died 
— if that doesn’t say 
something about how 
a nation can mourn 
an idol, nothing does. 
The Hollywood “rule 
of three” could be an 
attempt to reconcile 
how 
these 
beloved 
artists 
who 
often 
seem 
invincible 
— 
immortal, even — are 
still human, no matter 
how talented they are 
(or how much plastic 
surgery they buy). 
The “rule of three” 
is 
a 
fascinating 
example of humanity perceives 
death. Even though we often 
toot 
our 
horn 
about 
how 
advanced 
and 
modern 
the 
21st century may be, when 
confronted with death it is 
almost instinctual to revert 
to (arguably) more primitive 
wonder with the supernatural, 
divine 
or 
unnatural. 
Sure, 
everybody 
has 
to 
die 
one 
day. But it’s far more fun to 
speculate that darker forces 
swirl behind the Golden Gates 
of Hollywood’s elite. 
For now, we can just cross 
our fingers that when another 
one bites the dust, they won’t 
take another fan favorite with 
them.

Third time’s the charm: On 
Hollywood’s ‘rule of three’

MADELEINE GANNON
Daily Arts Writer

“Exceptional 
cuisine, 
worth a special journey” is 
all that accompanies three 
small, rounded stars next to 
a restaurant’s name in the 
“Michelin Guides.” Yet those 
three stars are a gateway to 
global fame. People from 
around 
the 
world 
(well, 
certain kinds of people) will 
indeed go out of their way to 
go to that certain restaurant. 
Reservations will have to 
be made months in advance. 
The award isn’t accompanied 
by a gaudy ceremony or any 
more fanfare at all really. 
But for chefs around the 
world, those three little stars 
are 
worth 
sacrifice 
after 
sacrifice after sacrifice.
By now, the origins and 
mystique 
surrounding 
Michelin 
Stars 
are 
well 
known. Those who award 
the prizes in the first place 
are completely anonymous, 
known 
to 
no 
chef, 
no 
journalist, not even their 
own families. The first star 
for a restaurant is extremely 
difficult, and gaining each 
subsequent 
star 
becomes 
even more so. The pressure 
mounts exponentially as well. 
Even with one star, a chef is 
at least a minor celebrity. But 
once a chef gets two or three, 
they become something only 
short of royalty. Yet the 
higher one rises, the more 
precarious the fall.
Bernard Loiseau, graduate 
of the legendary kitchen La 
Maison Troisgros and head 
chef of his own La Côte 
d’Or, committed suicide in 

2003 after rumors that his 
restaurant would lose its 
third star. His story was the 
inspiration for “Ratatouille” 
four 
years 
later. 
The 
pressure in kitchens of this 
level are beyond our wildest 
imaginations, but are these 
three little stars really worth 
anything at all?
Perhaps it is a rather silly 
question to ask. To many 
(maybe 
most) 
chefs, 
at 
least in the Western world, 
these stars represent the 
pinnacle of their profession, 
the 
equivalent 
of 
the 
Nobel, 
Oscar, 
Pulitzer, 
etc. 
Ultimately, 
though, 
the 
value 
is 
created 
by 
us, 
the 
consumers. 
But, 
once again, who are the 
consumers? France, Japan 
and the U.S. are the most 
represented 
countries 
in 
the list of Michelin-starred 
restaurants. 
As 
one 
can 
expect, 
the 
majority 
of 
restaurants can be found in 
the Parises, New Yorks and 
Tokyos of these countries. 
And they’re not cheap — the 
tasting menu at Benu in San 
Francisco is $310 a person.
It’s clear that the people 
creating 
the 
demand 
are 
the one percent. Moreover, 
the cuisine very noticeably 
represented 
in 
any 
list 
of 
Michelin-starred 
restaurants 
is 
French. 
There’s no doubt that French 
cuisine is highly influential, 
and the layout and structure 
of the modern kitchen is 
thanks to the French. But it’s 
important to keep in mind 
that several rich and varied 
cuisines of the world are not 
represented on these lists 
due to a lack of chefs trained 

at top kitchens overseas and 
a lack of clientele in their 
own cities.
It’s hard to deny that 
meals 
from 
Michelin 
starred 
restaurants 
are 
often spectacular. However, 
it might be more valuable 
to completely ignore these 
ratings 
and 
simply 
seek 
out the unique and special. 
Follow in the footsteps of 
Jonathan Gold and explore 
every nook and cranny of your 
local city to find every great 
meal you can. Highlight the 
upstart immigrant chefs who 
already make so many of your 
meals. Celebrate the women 
and other minorities who 
are so under-represented in 
these lists. And perhaps even 
more importantly, be willing 
to pay top dollar for certain 
cuisines. 
A 
fancy 
dinner 
need not always be French 
or Italian. Anthony Bourdain 
once said, “I’m very excited 
about the possibilities for 
that (Mexican) cuisine, and 
I think we should pay more 
attention to it, learn more 
about it, and value it more. 
This 
is 
frankly 
a 
racist 
assumption 
that 
Mexican 
food or Indian food should be 
cheap. That’s not right.” I’m 
inclined to agree, and more 
importantly, 
to 
advocate 
for this type of attitude for 
any 
cuisine 
from 
around 
the world which we already 
enjoy, 
and 
whose 
flavors 
already 
influence 
every 
major Western cuisine today.
The idea is, yes, Michelin 
Stars are a great metric to 
judge a restaurant. But we 
can extend our pockets and 
our gratitude towards so 
much more.

The big value in having
all three Michelin stars

‘Old Town Road 
(ft. Billy Ray 
Cyrus)’

Lil Nas X

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘OLD TOWN ROAD’

“Ridin’ on a tractor, lean 
all in my bladder.”
These stupid lit lyrics 
drip, soaked in the spirit of 
the hip-haw genre. 
There comes a time in 
a 
writer’s 
career 
when 
they 
are 
launched 
into 
uncharted territory. Never 
would 
I 
imagine 
this 
territory to be the depths 
of 
the 
largely 
pastoral, 
cowboy 
agenda 
that 
is 
Tik Tok (Musical.ly’s son, 
Vine’s distant cousin).
Lil 
Nas 
X’s 
smash 
single “Old Town Road” 
has risen as a cultural 
phoenix that ignited the 
weirdest 
parts 
of 
the 
internet, personifying the 
cowboy emoji and igniting 
an inescapable “yee-haw 
boi” energy that has lead 
the meme empire to its 
climax. In March of 2019, 
“Old Town Road” rose to 
the top of both Billboard’s 
Hot Country Chart and 
Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Chart, 
only to be removed from 
the country chart due to 

its 
supposed 
deviation 
from traditional country 
roots (ahem, some would 
argue, a deviation from 
whiteness). 
Since 
being 
thrown from the horse that 

is Billboard’s Hot Country 
Chart, Lil Nas X dropped a 
remix of “Old Town Road” 
featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, 
and is now at the top spot 
on the Billboard Hot 100.
“Old 
Town 
Road” 
is 
the blissful apex of the 
cowboy energy that has 
flooded popular culture. 
The pause between “I’m 

gonna” 
and 
“rideeeee” 
quite possibly hits harder 
than 
all 
four 
seasons 
of 
Hannah 
Montana 
combined. Genius’s lyric 
interpretation 
video 
of 
“Old Town Road” dropped 
just 
yesterday, 
and 
it 
soared to over 2 million 
views in just eight hours. 
The most shocking piece of 
this phenomenon, however, 
is Lil Nas X’s fair and 
square, 
joyous 
attitude: 
This man seems to take no 
notice of the questions his 
single raises about race, 
genre, media, memes and 
success. 
In 
interviews, 
he simply basks in joy 
without 
acknowledging 
his role in single-handedly 
challenging 
present-day 
cultural associations. He’s 
just a hip-haw cowboy, 
humbly praising pioneers 
like Young Thug and Lil Uzi 
Vert. That bliss — that’s the 
root of yee-haw energy.

One of my favorite things 
to witness in the American 
suburban expanse is ridiculous 
buildings trying their best 
to 
incorporate 
motifs 
of 
classical 
architecture. 
On 
Eisenhower, in the south of 
Ann Arbor, there’s a strip 
mall that’s trying it’s best to 
look like a fun-size imitation 
of the Colosseum, except it’s 
only a semicircle, and I don’t 
think there are any Tropical 
Smoothies in Rome. At this 
faux façade, with its vehicular 
arena of a parking lot, there is 
a Tex-Mex fast-casual chain 
called Moe’s Southwest Grill. 
It’s objectively worse than 
Panchero’s or Qdoba, but I like 
it the best. I like it because it 
reminds me of Clemson, South 
Carolina, a then-small town 
with a college a lot of my family 
attended, home to a Moe’s 
location I ate at when I was 
eight or so. I was stupid then, 
so I probably made my mom 
order me a cheese quesadilla. 
The multicolored plastic kid’s 
cup with the big bendy straw 
lodged in the lid similarly 
lodged itself in my mind.
Why am I talking about 
a 
pretty 
okay 
fast 
casual 
southwestern 
chain 
for 
a 
Books piece in a B-Side themed 
around the number three? 
Truth be told, I don’t know. I 
do know this is how my mind 
jumps: Weird Roman rip-off 
architecture to Moe’s to South 
Carolina 
to 
the 
Anderson 
public library. There’s a Moe’s 
in my Southern hometown 
as there is a daunting library 
that looks like a downsized 
Parthenon (or at least it was 
daunting to me when I was 
eight and two stories equated 
to about seven kid Cassies 
stacked on top of each other). 
I always left the library with 
a book when my mom took me, 
but I never read them there; my 
time was happily spent logging 
hours on the computers playing 
Magic School bus point-and-
click games.
I do know that tenuous little 
connections like this make up 
my lifetime career and hobby 
of reading and writing, from 
its humble beginnings in South 
Carolina to its radical new 
changes in Germany to its 
uncertain endings in Michigan. 
I’ve lived in a trilogy of fixed 
places in the never-ending 
and incessantly moving series 
of novels that is my life. I’ve 
lived in a few more houses, but 

three places. Two continents. 
One girl who bided a lot of 
her time alone, in the pages of 
constructed worlds that were 
always easier to follow than 
real life.
In first grade I was put in 
an accelerated reader program 
because I smoked all the 
measly excuses for chapter 
books out of the water. Some 
called me a gifted student, but 
I know now that translates to 
“gay and depressed by their 
teenage years.” I remember 
being 
presented 
with 
the 
challenge of tackling some 
more advanced literature — in 
this case, “The Chronicles of 
Narnia” — and the next day 
I came in proclaiming I was 
already finished with “The 
Horse and His Boy.” Never 
mind the fact “The Horse and 
His Boy” was the fifth book in 
the series. I, with my advanced 
tyke eyesight, had conquered 
it.
I didn’t actually read the 
book. I just sat in my bed and 
stared really hard at a page for 
30 seconds before flipping to 
the next.
Cut to few years later and a 
bunch of miles farther, and my 
fifth-grade class was tasked 
with writing a story for a 
big assignment for the class. 
Inspired by the worlds of Percy 
Jackson and Charlie Bone, 
my opus was about a group of 
ragtag friends who get thrust 
into a fantastical situation and 
solve it with some ingenuity 
and the power of staying true 
to your heart, or something. 
The gimmick with this story 
was time travel, and the name? 
“Back in Time.” A classic. I still 
have it printed on now decade-
old paper if you want a signed 
copy.
In fifth grade I was living 
in Germany, and the school 
library was up a set of stairs 
from the fifth and fourth 
grade hallway. It was the 
highest point in the school, 
its 
atmosphere 
airy 
from 
all the natural lighting the 
surrounding windows allowed. 
Almost every week I would 
parse through its tight shelves, 
looking for a title of “Horrible 
Histories” 
I 
hadn’t 
read 
before. A lot of the historical 
references were lost on me, but 
I loved the pictures.
Walking up the stairs of the 
North Hatcher Stacks doesn’t 
fill me with that same brand 
of childlike glee. I hardly walk 
up them to check out a book, —
only to suffer. Writing is a lot 
more involved now, and the 
reading so tough that even if I 

try to read a page it feels like 
I’m back in first grade staring 
at argle-bargle. Yet at least in 
my sophomore year of college I 
find myself trying to read and 
write — more so than when I 
first moved to Michigan.
Reading and writing was 
always mindless fun in the 
first two places I lived. In the 
third, it used to be a taxing 
chore. Fun was no longer to be 
found. My energy spent trying 
to make new friends or make 
sense of this crazy new state 
did often not see any reward, 
so I forewent my traditional 
pastimes for … nothing, really. 
When I became aware that my 
family was to leave Germany 
soon, that we would have to 
leave behind the life to which I 
had practically just adjusted, a 
spark died in me. Germany had 
become a waste; things would 
be better in Michigan, a fresh 
start.
When things weren’t better 
in eighth grade at a Michigan 
Catholic 
middle 
school, 
I 
assured myself things would 
be better in high school. A 
fresher start.
They weren’t much better at 
all.
Being 
designated 
an 
accelerated reader back in first 
grade meant I spent reading 
time in a group separate from 
the class. However, this group 
consisted of me and me alone. 
Perhaps this was the first time 
I realized I was forever doomed 
to the outside, never able to 
pinpoint why I could never 
quite fit in. Did I just need to 
make more friends? Did I just 
need to have a girlfriend? How 
could I be normal?
Perhaps the answers to those 
questions were found in the 
childhood books I read, with 
their 
outsider 
protagonists, 
and they secretly lodged their 
way into my mind. Only now 
do I know I’m far from normal, 
but I’m pretty cool with that. 
At the end of the day I really 
do love being a (beautiful) 
transgender woman. I regret 
a lot of things about my 
childhood, primarily the fact 
I’ll never have the girlhood I 
always wanted, but there were 
nuggets of good. Tiny, silly 
memories that form the person 
I am today. Scenes from the 
trilogy of places that is my life.
I can’t rewrite my past, rip 
it out like a page of a notebook 
or chuck its Word document 
in a digital trash bin. I sure as 
hell can write my future, and 
until I figure out exactly what 
I want it to be, I’ll keep reading 
to find out.

On the threefold literary
litany of my very own life

B-SIDE: BOOKS

Movies are no stranger to 
love triangles — “Twilight,” 
“The 
Princess 
Bride” 
and 
“Pretty in Pink” all heavily 
showcased the metaphorical 
polygon. “Three to Tango,” 
1999’s 
spicy 
Australian-
American romcom, joins the 
ranks of movies that rely on 
the problems of having three 
people in a relationship.
The 
triangle 
can 
be 
a 
gorgeously balanced shape — 
three equal angles and three 
equal sides all connected at 
clean points. But rarely does 
a love triangle ever emulate 
the stability of an equilateral 
triangle. 
More 
often 
than 
not, it resembles an isosceles 
triangle with two longer sides 
gripping for dear life on the 
shorter, conflicted member 
of 
the 
group, 
sometimes 
even 
morphing 
into 
that 
dreaded scalene triangle that 
seemingly follows zero rules 
of logic.
But there is some semblance 
of thought behind a love 
triangle or, at the very least, 
an element of predictability. 
“Three 
to 
Tango” 
is 
no 
different. Characters end up 
heartbroken and, in true rom-
com fashion, pouring their 
heart out to the other in front 
of a giant crowd at some fancy 
gala in a big city.
Matthew 
Perry 
(“Fools 
Rush In”) plays Oscar Novak, 
essentially a Chandler Bing 
who lives in Chicago whose 

biggest worry is the fact that 
he’s in love with his boss’s 
mistress who also happens to 
think he’s gay. Like I said, love 
triangles are messy.
Amy 
(Neve 
Campbell, 
“Skyscraper”) 
and 
Oscar 
have the kind of meet-cute 
we all want — Oscar, always 
the hero, dramatically saves 
Amy’s artwork and their first 
encounter is a tense moment in 
which everyone around them 
falls away. It was magical. The 
only cloud over the situation 
and the real sticking point 
of the movie is that Oscar’s 
boss also happens to be Amy’s 
protective 
(Domineering? 
Possessive?) 
boyfriend, 
Charles (Dylan McDermott, 
“Perks of Being a Wallflower”). 
Eventually, the relationships 
evolve into the classic love 
triangle tropes: Oscar is seen 
as a “close” friend and Charles 
is the enticing rich-boy. Amy 
is stuck in the middle.
Part of the reason love 
triangles work so well is 
that drama is inherent — 
the 
minute 
someone 
feels 
even a smidge of jealousy 
or a character realizes their 
feelings, 
all 
hell 
breaks 
loose. As Charles becomes 
suspicious of Amy and Oscar’s 
relationship, the only saving 
grace is the fact that Charles 
is convinced Oscar is gay. As 
Oscar pines away for Amy, the 
movie’s audience wishes for 
more of Oscar’s work partner, 
the man who is actually gay 
and with better jokes to boot. 
And, honestly, for how much I 
wanted to hate Charles, Dylan 

McDermott 
is 
a 
gorgeous 
human being with a smirk to 
die for. Forget Matthew Perry 
and a bumbling Oscar — give 
me a Dylan McDermott who 
doesn’t know he looks like an 
actual Greek god.
Though “Three to Tango” 
has an interesting premise, the 
actual plot fails to age well. 
The notion that Oscar and his 
work partner are dating hangs 
in the air with no one daring 
to touch them. Characters 
broach the subject unable to 
even say the word — through 
several 
uncomfortable 
moments in which secretaries 
and 
competing 
coworkers 
meet eyes and say the pair are 
— you know — demonstrate 
the uneasy attitude towards 
the LGBTQ+ community that 
was the norm in the 1990s.
Eventually, the movie wraps 
up in the expected fashion: 
Oscar and Amy get together 
after a teary reunion in a 
diner and it eventually comes 
out that for all his confident 
posturing with Amy, Charles 
is, surprisingly, a sub in the 
bedroom. It was the kind of 
funny irony that the movie 
lacked throughout.
“Three to Tango” didn’t add 
anything new to the concept 
of love triangles or romantic 
comedies. 
There 
were 
no 
insights, no vampires and 
an air of homophobia that’s 
present in too many late ’90s/
early ’00s movies. And yet, 
it’s still a charming romantic 
comedy that, even if you 
don’t love it, is easily enjoyed 
ironically.

4B — Thursday, April 11, 2019


I’m single right now, and I’m never single. I don’t know how 
to be single. For years my life revolved around a girl. Three girls, 
Emma, Mary and Haley, in that order, with no more than a one 
month gap between each. Emma sucked. We broke up. Mary had 
her own shit to figure out. We broke up. And Haley? Haley was 
perfect. But my heart wasn’t in it anymore, and she deserved 
only the best. We broke up.
Then the devil downstairs called. It had been three weeks 
since me and Haley ended it — just long enough for my moral 
compass to approve of reinstalling Tinder. Lots of cute couples 
looking for a third for a threesome — too advanced for me. I 
hook up with the third girl that swipes right on me. Deep down, 
I didn’t want to. I didn’t think I didn’t want to at the time, of 
course. I’m kind of a shy guy, so sometimes I need a shot to give 
me a bit of a confidence boost. I needed three shots of Fireball. 
That’s how I knew. It was okay. She holds my hand afterward and 
it scares me. I don’t text her the next morning, or the next one. 
On day three I unmatch her. Not enough — I uninstall Tinder 
too. Three weeks later I would dig up her number at 3 a.m.
“hey, u up?”
I delete the message before sending and delete her number 
too.
That was the third time I ever slept with someone outside of a 
committed relationship, with someone I barely knew. The third 
time was not a charm. Thinking about it makes me shiver, so I 
swear off girls for a while.
A few days later I go to a co-op party. I was going out with my 
friends, and I wanted nothing more than for it to be a wholesome, 
comforting night. I wanted to make unforgettable memories 
with the people I care about. No silly flirting, no seeking sex, no 
going for girls.
I wake up in the morning with minimal memory of the night. 
Three condoms line my pockets. How crazy a night was I planning 
on having? Looks to me like I didn’t do anything, though.
Then I notice my arm wrapped around someone. It’s my best 
friend. Oh — almost forgot — I confessed my feelings to her last 
night. Sometime in the night, our faces side by side, enough 
moonlight filtered through the window for me to see the outlines 
of her face. I told her, a small part of me really likes you, but I 
could forget about it. Should I?
“Maybe for now.”
Those words echo in my head and I turn my back to her. I try 
to remember and make certain I really did that and it wasn’t just 
a dream. It was definitely not a dream. I slip out of my head, slip 
out of her bed, slip out of her house. I slip into my house, slip into 

my bed, slip into my head. We 
don’t talk about it. For three 
days I adore her. I recount the 
whole situation over the phone 
to a close friend from back 
home.
“You don’t actually like her,” 
she says. “You just don’t know 
how to be single.” I already 
knew that.
A switch flips and I cringe 
at my confession, and I’m 
intensely 
grateful 
that 
we 
could just be friends. I was 
just confused, I think. She 
Snapchats me about a boy she 
likes and I breathe a sigh of 
relief. I would not pay for the 
mistake of a hasty confession. I 
swear to forget about it not for 
now, but forever. Let this be a 
lesson, I think. Stop it with the 
girls, stop it with the feelings, 
stop seeking out what I know I 
don’t want and don’t need and 
can’t conceivably contain in 
my complicated, consternated 
cranium.
I got drunk thrice the next 
week. First on Tuesday, while 
shooting the shit with a couple pals. Then on Thursday, alone. 
The third time was at my party on Friday.
It was a party for my people at The Daily. We probably broke 
a fire code, with 20-something writers crammed in my tiny 
apartment. I fell in love with three different girls that night. I 
had a type: Books writers. Only natural — I write for music, but I 
just feel a connection with the books writers, like I really know 
them. Girl one was the life of the party, but I forgot about her as 
soon as girl two walked in. Girl two was cute, so cute I felt pulled 
to her like gravity, but I forgot about her as soon as girl three 
walked in. Girl three didn’t write for books, but she was smart. 
She engaged me in a half hour of meaningful conversation. I only 
remember three minutes of it.
Within three hours, the party emptied all three 12-packs 
of Twisted Tea and three bottles: one Capriccio sangria, one 
Barefoot rose and a handle of Costco vodka. I asked everyone 
to Venmo me three dollars. Twenty people said “Going” on 
Facebook — that would cover it. Thirty people came. I wake up 
to 10 Venmos and a slew of forgotten drunk selfies with two girls 
on Books I barely knew. I don’t really know anyone on Books, 
though. Wonder why I took pictures with them.
I remember a smart girl, though. I think we only talked for 
like, three minutes, but she was smart, and smarts are attractive. 
What was her name? Her face?
The smart girl Venmo’d me. Three dollars and a “Thank you!” 
in the description. That’s right — Jasmine.
Maybe I didn’t remember what we talked about, but something 
told me that she Venmo’d me for a reason. And so I was compelled 
to Venmo her back. One cent? That’s too cheap. Two cents? That 
should be saved for giving someone your “two cents.” Three 
cents? Three cents would do it.
Three cents to Jasmine. Venmo asked, What is this payment 
for?
“hey, what’s up :~)”
She gave me a like but didn’t reply. I don’t know what I was 
expecting by sliding into her Venmo anyway. I don’t know 
what I wanted. I didn’t want anything, actually. Did I not learn 
anything from the three girlfriends? Oh, right — almost forgot 
about those. Wonder what they’re up to.
Emma is perpetually boring and drab, Instagram peppered 
with mediocre photos of her and her friends. Looks like she’s 
finally gotten a new boyfriend, though. We broke up three years 
ago, but the pain of our shitty soul-sucking relationship still 
stings like it was just yesterday. Poor boy doesn’t know what he’s 
gotten himself into. I silently pray for him.
Mary went through a breakup recently too, if her Twitter is 
any sign. I don’t know why she went and got another boyfriend 
right after dumping me anyway. From what I’ve heard, that guy 

was who you get when you try to describe Dylan Yono in three 
seconds. If he was anything like me, she should’ve known he 
was no good for her. She doesn’t look like she’s gotten her shit 
together — I thought that was the point of our breakup in the 
first place — but she’s clearly trying, now. I won’t speak to her, 
but I bear no ill will towards her. I wish her well.
Haley’s taking a break from social media in the wake of our 
breakup. The only clue that she still hasn’t taken it very well is 
her Spotify. She made three playlists about me: “y so sad,” “i wish 
this was a movie” and “it’s time to sleep.” My photo graces the 
cover of the third one. Shot from behind, I sit hunched over a 
canvas with brush in hand, painting on a picnic blanket in her 
backyard. My heart aches. I want her to be happy. I don’t regret 
breaking up with her, but I miss knowing who to love.
Only one thing is constant in my life, and it is getting the Jerk 
Pork Lunch Special at Jamaican Jerk Pit at 3 p.m. every Monday 
afternoon. Today a friend joins me. Alice had her third and final 
date with a frat boy at the ripe hour of 11 p.m. the night before, a 
disaster in all ways, so her story went. At the end of the night, he 
started acting weird, called off the sex, went to sleep, turned his 
back to her the whole night. She’s confused, horribly, horribly 
confused and all she wants is clarity, to know what went wrong.
“What would make you act like that?” She asks me with sincere 
curiosity.
“Nothing. I would never act that way.” My mind wanders to 
the girl I hooked up with.
After lunch we part ways at the Diag. We talk shit about boys 
and how they’re all trouble.
“You’re not a bad guy, though,” Alice tells me. I wonder if 
that’s really true.
I spend the evening “studying” in a quiet corner at the library. 
No work gets done. I am lost in my head again. Me and Haley 
broke up so I could focus on myself. It’s been over a month now 
and I just replaced a thousand thoughts about her with a hundred 
thoughts about thirty different girls. If you do the math, you’ll 
find that my thought-burden tripled. I wish I could be free from 
this curse of three.
A moment of clarity does not lift the curse, but for a moment I 
feel at ease. The last three weeks were not a loveless disaster. My 
club had a day of bonding where we went to a newsroom concert, 
studied together and watched a collection of short films at the 
theater. I made a new friend, and we enjoyed bubble tea together. 
A close friend and I had a slumber party, gossiping all night long. 
Another friend saw a musical with me. My cousin texted me to 
tell me she missed me. An acquaintance at an event meeting 
stopped me on the way out to tell me she thought I was really 
funny. Someone DMed me a meme that reminded them of me. 
My parents read my latest article for the paper, and told me they 
were proud. These three weeks were full of love. I just wasn’t 
looking. I feel on the verge of something that could put myself 
at peace.
The library closes and I scurry over to the dorms to spend some 
time with a close friend. We relax in her room, listening to Frank 
Ocean’s “Pink + White,” talking about this and that and this and 
that. She says her love life has been uneventful lately, but she’s 
okay with that, and she’s been able to focus on deepening her 
relationships with her friends. I hug her and tell her I’m proud 
of her for that. We get a bit emotional about all the friend-love 
we’ve been feeling. There’s something fulfilling about it.
It hits me. The curse isn’t the crushing weight of 3,000 thirsty 
thoughts. The curse is the emptiness in my heart when I forget 
about what truly makes me happy. I remember the co-op party 
and how I just wanted to make memories with the people I care 
about. I recall the sense of relief when the friend I confessed 
to liking a different boy. I realize my apathy toward the hook-
up girl, toward Jasmine, toward Haley, the apathy that made me 
realize I didn’t want to be in love anymore. I decide then and 
there to embrace those feelings from the moment of clarity in my 
cozy corner at the library. They would become more than just a 
moment. The friends that I love would become my lifestyle.
My sophomore summer is only three weeks away now. I’ll be 
here, in Ann Arbor, and some close friends of mine will be staying 
too. I think about summer festivals and concerts, upcoming 
movies, restaurants I haven’t tried, the double-hammock in my 
closet, video games, all the things I want to go and see and watch 
and do with friends that are dear to me. Love for them wells in 
my heart. I fall in love in a different way.
All is well now. Maybe romance will find me in my third year.

If you want to see how 
dramatically 
times 
have 
changed, look no further than 
the overnight rise and gradual 
fall of 3OH!3. In the summer of 
2008, a season dominated by 
Michael Phelps’s breakout at 
the Beijing Olympics and other 
timeless late 2000s pop songs 
like Katy Perry’s “I Kissed 
a Girl” and Coldplay’s “Viva 
la Vida,” Colorado duo Sean 
Foreman and Nathaniel Motte 
released their triple-platinum 
hit “DONTTRUSTME.”
With 
its 
glitchy 
synths, 
sun-soaked casual misogyny 
and 
iconically 
odd 
lyrics 
(“Tell your boyfriend / If he 
says he’s got beef / That I’m 
a vegetarian / And I ain’t 
fucking scared of him”), the 

song 
found 
massive 
chart-
topping success. It was heard 
everywhere that year — playing 
on the radio, at bar mitzvah 
parties, at summer camp and 
on that Tap Tap Revenge game 
everyone was obsessed with. 
Their 
champagne-coated, 
frat-boy brand capitalized on 
the dirty lust that spurred 
the uncontrollable hormones 
of 
American 
adolescents, 
simulating an experience that 
was at turns angry, horny and 
silly. As evidenced by the song’s 
over-the-top 
music 
video, 
the two frontmen also played 
with and reinforced tropes of 
masculinity, sifting through a 
series of costumes that included 
cheetah-printed 
speedos, 
wrestling singlets, cavemen loin 
cloths and white button-down 
shirts with loosened black ties 
and sunglasses (which they 
wore indoors, of course). 

3OH!3 
was 
the 
perfect 
encapsulation of an era defined 
by popped collars, Warped Tour, 
“Jersey Shore” and questionable 
hairstyles. Listening to them 
was like eating birthday cake 
hungover 
for 
breakfast 
— 
sweetly spontaneous in the 
moment, but really disgusting 
in retrospect. Whether the 
douchebag personas Foreman 
and 
Motte 
embodied 
in 
“DONTTRUSTME” 
and 
the 
rest of their discography was 
real 
or 
performative, 
their 
short-lived legacy represented 
an important turning point in 
American pop music. 
As obnoxious and politically 
incorrect as they were (and 
still are, 12 years since their 
debut), 3OH!3 resembled an 
intoxicating care-free, DGAF 
attitude that is rarely seen in 
today’s pop music landscape — 
although one could argue The 

Chainsmokers have taken their 
place. They contain a capsule 
of pre-2010s nostalgia that, 
when unearthed in 2019, reeks 
of male fragility and Axe Body 
Spray but also comes with the 
promise of unabashed joy and 
confetti cannons. 
Revisiting their breakthrough 
record WANT, which features 
“DONTTRUSTME” and their 
beguiling Katy Perry collab 
“STARSTRUKK,” 
I 
found 
myself transported back to 
middle school, recalling images 
of glowstick necklaces, striped 
hats, colored braces, sweaty 
foreheads, iPod Touches and 
my lithe 4’11’’ body going a 
little too hard on the dance 
floor at a school formal. It was 
an equally amazing and terrible 
sensation to re-immerse myself 
in Foreman and Motte’s flashy 
fantasy world, where parties 
are 
never-ending, 
alcohol 
is flowing, cocaine is being 
insufflated and girls are sex 
objects, 
qualities 
that 
are 
horrible both in concept and 
reality.
For all their hilarious, cringe-
worthy attempts at charming 
women while also being creepy 
and possessive toward them in 
their music, there’s something 
absurdly fascinating about the 
combination of Foreman and 

Motte’s predatory lyrics and 
their catchy, easily digestible 
sound. Other WANT tracks like 
“HOLLERTILYOUPASSOUT” 
find both 3OH!3 frontmen doing 
their best Lil Jon impressions, 
yelling with feverish aggression 
about 
their 
hometown 
of 
Boulder and bragging about a 
sexual transaction (the entire 
chorus is just the line: “Hey 
yeah, shake-shake your ass 
now”). The insidious, male-
gazey 
“PHOTOFINNISH” 
— yes, they even misspelled 
“finish” — contains so, so 
many problematic lines that it 
makes Michael Bay look like a 
novice. 3OH!3’s more refined 
but amateurish follow-up to 
WANT, 2010’s Streets of Gold, 
also carries a few hedonistic, 
grimy bops like the Ke$ha-
featuring 
“My 
First 
Kiss” 
and 
the 
appendage-centric 
“Touchin On My.” 
And 
yet, 
I 
find 
myself 
gravitating toward their songs, 
not because I agree with their 
lyrical approach, but because 
of how easily they manage 
to sneak in their unseemly 
desires within their intriguing 
blend of emo, electro, rave 
and rap. Unlike most artists, 
who learn to evolve and grow 
with every record they make, 
3OH!3 
have 
pretty 
much 

stayed 
committed 
to 
their 
dude-bro sensibility since they 
arrived in the mainstream. 
It might not have benefitted 
Foreman and Motte in the 
long run — their most recent 
efforts, 2013’s OMENS and 
2016’s NIGHT SPORTS sound 
like god-awful, overproduced 
parodies of their earlier work 
— but they possess a strangely 
unique ability in toeing the line 
between satire and sincerity, 
subverting 
the 
“sex, 
drugs 
and rock ‘n’ roll” element 
of fame and celebrity while 
simultaneously embracing it. 
In the end, 3OH!3’s songs are 
light, harmless and cheesy fun 
that, even in today’s socially 
conscious climate, shouldn’t be 
taken too seriously. 
There’s a reason why most 
people have a guilty pleasure. 
Sometimes, we just need a 
quick and easy relief from the 
constraints of everyday life: a 
trashy song, a bad movie, a low-
tier TV show that’s palpable 
enough to consume and keep 
our 
tiny 
attention 
spans 
entertained, if only for a few 
fleeting minutes. For me, that 
guilty pleasure is 3OH!3. Their 
music may not be the most 
intellectually 
or 
creatively 
stimulating, but they sure can 
make a hit that sticks like grits.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘COOL’

Even the sweet embrace 
of nostalgia can’t save the 
cringe-inducing 
mess 
of 
the Jonas Brothers’s latest 
music video, “Cool.”
As a product of Disney 
Channel’s 
proclaimed 
“Golden Age,” I felt an 
obligation to join the Jonas 
Brothers’s comeback party. 
Maturity be damned — I’d 
be lying to myself if I said 
I wasn’t a tiny bit excited 
to hear of the trumpeted 
return of childhood idols. 
Unfortunately, 
“Cool” 
is 
everything one would expect 
it to be when blind optimism 
is thrown away: boring.
In fact, not only is it boring, 
but it’s unoriginal, awkward 
and (again) vividly cringey. 
The video is uncomfortable 
and 
semi-heartbreaking 
for anyone with even the 
lowest 
expectations. 
It’s 
just plain bad. That’s not to 
say they didn’t try — in fact, 
it’s painfully apparent just 
how hard the brothers tried 
to be “cool.” Sadly for them, 
a bad mustache (like, ew, 
Joe), name-dropping actual 
talents (like James Dean) 
and singing “Dammit, I’m 

so cool” (please, calm down) 
can’t do much when you’re 
already beyond saving.
In the video the three 
Jonas 
Brothers 
— 
Nick, 

Joe and Kevin — play a 
hired boy-band at a skeezy 
beachside hotel, set in an 
ambiguously 
vintage 
era. 
The majority of the video 
spotlights Nick — most likely 
a nod to his recent rapid rise 
in popularity. It seems the 
reign of Joe Jonas as the fan 
favorite is over. The brothers 
(very ambitiously) compare 
themselves to James Dean, 
which 
instead 
of 
suave 
comes off as a biting wince. 
Nick’s awkward lip syncing 
is an inescapable horror. 
Watching him strut on the 
screen and repeatedly do 

fist pumps is a performance 
no one ever wanted, or ever 
will. There’s a lingering 
irony, too, as the lyrics 
“Cool” repeat over and over 
while the brothers grow 
considerably less cool with 
every second.
And, beyond all these 
pitfalls, 
there 
looms 
a 
far bigger, more painful 
misstep: Kevin. Or rather, 
the lack of Kevin. Once 
again, the third brother 
is forgotten. It’s like that 
awful mix of amusement 
and 
sharp 
second-hand 
embarrassment 
when 
in 
the film “Home Alone,” the 
family realizes they forgot 
their son.
So, 
save 
yourself 
the 
pain, 
and 
skip 
“Cool” 
this week, no matter how 
dedicated a fan you may 
be. Instead, remember the 
Jonas Brothers in their ’00s 
boy-band glory. It’s better 
to mourn the memory than 
suffer through their skin-
crawling grab to reclaim lost 
fame.

I’ve always found idiomatic 
language to be more useful 
and fun than direct speech. My 
grandmother, when I would 
visit her as a kid, would often 
announce that she was “going 
to spend a penny” after dinner, 
meaning that she was excusing 
herself to the restroom. I never 
understood what she meant 
when I was really young, but 
after I grew up, and developed 
my own code of idioms and 
phrases, I asked my mom. 
My 
grandmother 
is 
from 
Kent, England, where public 
restrooms formerly had coin-
operated locks. In order to use 
them, one had to drop a penny 
into the slot. My mother told 
me that idiomatic and rhyming 
language was commonly used 
in that area of England, where 
Cockney rhyming slang took 
hold. Once, my grandmother 
used the phrase “apples and 
pears” for “stairs.” I never 
really understood that one.
My father, an N.J. native, 
has his own set of idioms and 
phrases. He and I like to make 
fun of common business jargon, 
like “to put something on the 
parking lot,” meaning to save 
the idea for a later day, or “to 
put a pin in something,” which 
means about the same. Growing 
up, I was told to “hold my 
horses” when I was impatient 
and to “take my lumps” when 
something got the better of me. 
When I got a little heady, he 
would tell me to stop being a 
“smartmouth” when I was out 
of turn, or to “stop busting his 
chops” when I was in the right. 
As they were such a mystery 
in earlier parts of my life, 
idioms 
became 
increasingly 
interesting 
modes 
of 

communication, carrying their 
own histories and contexts. 
They reveal as much about the 
speaker’s thoughts and feelings 
as 
they 
do 
the 
speaker’s 
personal background. I’ve never 
heard anyone in the United 
States utter the phrase “spend 
a penny”; if anything, I’ve 
heard the crude “take a piss” 
from guys my age. By the same 
token, I’ve only heard business 
jargon 
from 
my 
parents, 
corporate presentations and 
Ross students. (Language can 
be an insidious tool.) Each 
idiom carries a history and 
a basic truth, and those that 
we employ tell others about 
where we come from. One of 
my favorites, one that I return 
to time and time again, is the 
phrase “two is company, three 
is a crowd.”
The phrase finds its origins 
in the notion that the symmetry 
and parity of two is “right.” 
Between two things, there is 
a clear thing-one-thing-two, 
self-and-other relationship, but 
as soon as you introduce a third 
object, the system grows in 
complexity. No longer are you 
dealing with one relationship 
— you’re dealing with three, 
unique relationships, between 
one and two, two and three and 
one and three. The paragon of 
this idiom is the love triangle, 
depicted in countless works 
of art and culture: Betty, 
Veronica and Archie in “Archie 
Comics”; Bella, Edward and 
Jacob in “The Twilight Saga”; 
Katniss, Peeta and Gale in 
“The Hunger Games”; I could 
go on. A relationship between 
two people is cool, I guess, but 
you want to know what’s really 
cool? Making things complex 
by adding another player.
It’s 
easy 
to 
have 
a 
presumptive harmony when 
you have one or two things: The 
beauty of singularity and unity 

of one object, the symmetry 
or diametric opposition of two 
things. But with three, it’s 
easy to unbalance. How far 
apart are these things? Which 
two elements of the system 
are closer, more alike, and 
how does that affect the third 
thing? There is a whole field 
of mathematics devoted to the 
relationship 
between 
three 
points: 
trigonometry. 
Since 
you’re reading the Arts section, 
I’ll just give you the meat 
and potatoes of the subject. 
Trigonometry 
reveals 
that 
there is a method to the madness 
of the lengths and angles 
between these three points. 
Trigonometry can be applied 
to countless subjects, and it’s 
always funny to remember 
that 
locating 
the 
apparent 
positions of stars in astronomy 
is possible because of triangles. 
In art, too, the tension of 
three finds usefulness in the 
“rule of thirds.” A centered 
single object or two objects 
in any relationship are boring 
to the eye. Offsetting the 
presumed harmony of unity or 
symmetry makes the eye look a 
little harder at a painting or a 
photography. Perhaps there is 
beauty in the tension of three.
Let’s return to the idiom, 
though. Three is a crowd, sure, 
as the chance for exclusion 
and “a loser” always exists in 
a love triangle, yet three is also 
complex and beautiful. Within 
three, there’s a productive 
friction that leads to great 
works of art and science — 
the same friction produces 
tension and hard feelings in 
relationships. It’s easy to feel 
behind the eight ball in love 
and life (just look at the crazy 
things 
that 
Bella, 
Edward 
and Jacob do competing for 
one another’s affections), but 
remember that two — er, three 
— can play at that game.
