A glimse at what could have been

As at at through the second
half of yesterday's game,
I felt
myself getting
wistful. Nostal-
gic, even.
And as I
watched Michi-
gan State's
Kalin Lucas hit
a mid-range NICOLE
jumper with AUERBACH
3.5 seconds
left to seal the
Spartans' 57-56 comeback win
over Michigan, I couldn't help but

wonder how sweet the Wolverines'
season could have been.
Fresh off an NCAA Tournament
second-round appearance, Michi-
gan had no reason to drop off this
season.
It wasn't supposed to be like
this. Ask anyone.
Sure, you can say the shots
haven't fallen this year, but just look
at last night's game. The Wolverines
more than held their own with the
Spartans, the fifth-ranked team in
the nation - they were one rimmed-
out layup away from thebiggest win
of their season. Your average .500

team hoping for an NIT bid doesn't
play like that and doesn't showcase
that level of talent.
Michigan isbetter than a.500
team, yet its record now stands at
10-10. The Wolverines could easily
have stolen awin from Michigan
State last night, no question about it.
So many times this season,
Michigan has kept itself in games
for so long. I'm starting to lose
count of how many times I've left a
Michigan basketball game with the
same exact feeling.
But almost-wins don't count,
and we're beyond moral victories.

Worst of all, the postseason pic-
ture is fading faster and faster with
each loss.
"We're supposed to be good,"
freshman point guard Darius Mor-
ris said last night. "I feel like we
should start winning. Enough of
this losing and learning experi-
ences - it's time for wins."
It's been time for wins all sea-
son, actually, and Michigan has
consistently been in position to get
them. Over and over, even when
they were struggling on the offen-
sive end, the Wolverines have had

Retention battle
with UNC pushed
President Coleman
to make fast choice
By KYLE SWANSON
DailyNewsEditor
Thoughyesterday's announce-
ment of University Provost Tere-
sa Sullivan's successor came
sooner than many on campus
expected, the choice of Philip
Hanlon as the next provost was
something few found surprising.
For many on campus, the
choice of Hanlon, who cur-
rently serves as vice provost of
academic and budgetary affairs,
and is a professor of mathemat-
ics, seemed a logical one. What
surprised some was that the
announcement came a mere two
weeks after Sullivan announced
she would be leavingthe Univer-
sity to become president of the

University of Virginia.
However, after interviews
with leading University admin-
istrators yesterday, evidence
surfaced that Hanlon's selection
as Sullivan's eventual successor
was in the works before anyone
knew whether Sullivan would be
chosen for the presidency at the
University of Virginia.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily yesterday, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man said she had known Sullivan
would be leaving for "quite a
long time," before it became pub-
lic and she began the process of
looking for Sullivan's successor
as quickly as possible.
"I had started considering
this actually about a month ago
and had started just as soon as
I could - I certainly couldn't
reveal anything about Terry -
but getting input from people,"
Coleman said.
To complicate the situation
further, the University was in

Micheline Maynard
discusses foreign
investment in Mich.
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
Micheline Maynard, a senior
business correspondent for The
New York Times, spoke yesterday
at the Ross School of Business's
Blau Auditorium, discussing
topics that ranged from foreign
investment in Michigan's econo-
my to Radiohead.
Joined on stage by Business
School Dean Robert J. Dolan,

Maynard - an adjunct professor
atthe Business School and author
of "The Selling of the American
Economy: How Foreign Compa-
nies Are Remaking the American
Dream," - discussed how collab-
oration with foreign companies
providesimportantopportunities,
and suggested that the dreaded
aftereffects of the recession might
actually be a good thing.
Maynard began the discussion
by addressing the stigma often
applied to foreign businesses'
moving into the United States.
When asked about the nega-
tive aspect of increasing foreign
investments in the nation, May-
nard said the so-called "selling of*

the American economy" doesn't
necessarily mean a loss of con-
trol, in fact it has happened many
times before.
"LookatAmericanhistory. For-
eign companies have been invest-
ing in the United States since the
1600's," she said. "If you look at
the Jamestown Colony, if you look
at the settlement of New England,
and if you look atthe railroads."
Rather than putting American
employees at a disadvantage, for-
eign companies investing in the
U.S. provide new economic oppor-
tunities, according to Maynard.

facturing in a foreign company

' Few students taking DPS up on free
anti-theft program for electronics

BLEEDING MAIZE AND BLUE

Though program was
launched last fall,
fewer than 500
students registered
By CAITLIN HUSTON
DailyStaffReporter
Though there are thousands of
students with electronics on cam-
pus, less than 500 have registered
their equipment with the Depart-
ment of Public Safety's comput-
er registration program, which
launched last semester.
The program, which currently.
has 432 people and 516 pieces of
equipment registered, aims to pre-
vent the theft of laptops and other

electronics by providing anyone
with a valid uniqname who signs up
on the DPS website with two stick-
ers. One sticker simply identifies
the computer as registered and the
other has a DPS barcode on it with
an identification number.
While DPS and library officials
say the program will help students
find their stolen computers, they
are still working to get more stu-
dents registered.
Stephen Hipkiss, a member of
the Campus Safety and Security
Advisory committee and facility
manager at the Hatcher Graduate
Library, said one strength of the
program is simply the awareness it
raises among students.
"It's one more way to remind peo-
ple that they need to take responsi-
bility for themselves," he said.

While Hipkiss has seen the stick-
ers on a number of students' laptops
in the Hatcher Graduate Library, he
said there should be more students
registered given the number of lap-
tops on campus.
He added that despite the low
number of students registered,
the program will ultimately aid
the department in their search for
other stolen electronics.
"If the authorities manage to
locate one laptop through this pro-
gram, they will be able to close mul-
tiple cases," he said.
Alex Serwer, MSA Business
School representative and Campus
Improvement Commission chair,
said he hopes to see more students
registering for the program. He
added that MSA will be working

I LOOKING FOR JOBSEEKERS

Picking the 'U' president

University presidents are often
chosen by administrators and fac-
ulty, but in 1966, University stu-
dents had a say.
The Student Government
Council passed a proposal - The
Replacement of Hatcher - that
called for students to help select
the successor to then-Univer-
sity President Harlan Hatcher,
according to a Jan. 28, 1966 arti-
cle in The Michigan Daily.
The committee would consist
of students and faculty members,
who would participate in making
the preliminary and ultimate deci-
sion regarding who would replace
Hatcher, who planned to leave his
position the following year.
The proposal was spearheaded
by then-junior Edward Robin-
son and then-sophomore Donald
Resnick - both members of the
SGC.

In the article, Robinson said he
believed "as a focal point of the
University, students should have
a voting voice in the choice of
their president."
Then-junior Alex Goodwin, a
SGC member, helped write a sec-
ond proposal with then-junior
Robert Bodkin that asked for the
University Board of Regents to
approve the committee's forma-
tion at the Feb. 11, 1966 regents
meeting.
"This is an area where students
have great interest and can hon-
estly be helpful in the selection of
the best man for the job," Good-
win said in the article.
Then-junior Steve Schwartz
agreed with Goodwin and said
in that article that "students
should be allowed to take part in
the decision making policy of the
University."

The proposal stated that the
committee should be composed
of one student for every two fac-
ulty. It also required the SGC to
submit a list of names of poten-
tial students who would sit on the
committee to the president of stu-
dent affairs.
The vice president, along with
the regents, would then make the
final decision on which students
would be chosen.
Hatcher served as the Univer-
sity's eight president from 1951 to
1967. The Harlan Hatcher Gradu-
ate Library was named in his
honor.
Robben Fleming, who passed
away Jan. 11, 2010, was chosen as
Hatcher's successor. Flemming
took office on Jan. 1 1968 and
served as University president for
11 years.

earns about $60,000 a year," she
said. "That's about 20 percent
more than the average worker at all
(other) manufacturing companies
in the United States."
Maynard also said international
companies setting up shop in the
U.S. don't usually pose a threat
because they often form partner-
ships with American businesses.
Shecited Toyota's joint venture with
General Motors and India-based
TaTa Coffee Ltd.'s recent purchase
of New Jersey-based Eight O' Clock
Coffee as examples of this type of
collaboration.
"This has been an opportunity
for (American employees), rather
than anything for them to be con-
cerned about," she said.
Maynard also discussed local
issues facing Michigan, which she
explored in her 2003 book, "The
End of Detroit: How the Big Three
Lost Their Grip." She said Michi-
ganders need to rethink their eco-
nomic perspective in the wake of
the recession, and think realisti-
cally about the state's future.
"That mentality of, 'it will all
come back and be as great as ever,'
that's probably not going to hap-

pen," she said. "Barring somehuge
recovery of the American economy,
we're never going to get back to the
level of car sales that we once did."
Instead, Maynard - an Ann
Arbor native - said Michigan
should focus on leveraging its nat-
ural resources to create new eco-
nomic possibilities, and cultivating
the level of talent the state has in
certain sectors like engineering.
"The less we try to pretend that
the old days will come back and the
more we try to figure out what the
future will be, the better it will be
for the state," she said.
The effects of the recession
might actually be a positive change,
both for the state and the nation as
a whole, and can serve as a unique
opportunity to recreate the Ameri-
can economy, Maynard said.
"After the Great Depression, we
went to war," she said. "Essentially
we rebuilt our industrial complex
to a military complex. After World
War II, we looked inward and
rebuilt America. This time I don't
think we can rebuild ourselves by.
looking inward or by choosing con-
flict as a way to rebuild. It's time for
some deep rethinking."
Maynard said she sees hope for
the country's future in the entre-
preneurial attitude of her students
at the Business School.

"They aren't waiting ti ,rgp-
cued by big companies, they're tak-
ing it into their own hands, to have
their piece of it," she said.
Though she's proud of the aca-
demic accomplishments of her stu-
dents, Maynard said it's important
for'them to also think outside the
world.of finance and marketing.
"Make them go to Hill audito-
rium and hear Radiohead. Make
them go to the Folk Festival and
hear Rufus Wainright," she said,
amidst chuckles from the audience.
"Let people think in a more creative
way than the route we have now in
the business curriculum."
Maynard's views on foreign
investment made some audience
members question what they
originally thought about U.S. col-
laboration with international
businesses.
Business School sophomore
Kelsey Weisberg said she previously
focused more on the effects of U.S.
outsourcing rather than consider-
ing the impact foreign investments
have within U.S. borders.
"This is new to me because
it's something different from the
norm," she said. "It's interesting to
hear about foreign companies pro-
viding opportunities at home and I
think it's something we should look
into for future policy."

PASADENA, Calif.
NASA to study
Haiti earthquake
faults via radar
NASA will study Haiti's earth-

special airborne radar system.
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena says a space agency
Gulfstream jet carrying the system
departed NASA's Dryden Flight
Research Center in the Mojave
Desert on Monday.
Scientists had already planned
a three-week aerial survey of Cen-
tral America and added a series of

after the magnitude-7.0 quake that
devastated Haiti on Jan. 12.
Principal investigator Paul Lun-

TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS
Judge in Honduras
clears generals, coup
amnesty OKd
A Supreme Court judge cleared
Honduras' military commanders
yesterday in the coup that toppled
Manuel Zelaya, and hours later
lawmakers approved amnesty for
the ousted leader and all those
involved in his removal.
The two measures - combined
with Wednesday's inauguration
of a new president, conservative
rancher Porfirio Lobo - appeared
to spell the last chapter in the bitter
political dispute that led to Hondu-
ras' international isolation.
Supreme Court President Jorge
Rivera ruled the country's top gen-
erals did not abuse their power in
ordering soldiers to escort Zelaya out
of the country at gunpoint June 28.
"Prosecutors failed to prove the
military chiefs acted with malice,"
he said in a statement.
The prosecution's case did not
question Zelaya's ouster itself -
only whether the six members of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff went too far in
flying him to Costa Rica after he was
arrested by soldiers in a dispute over
a constitutional referendum.

A Saab is scene at Crossway Saab in Montpelier, Vermont yesterday. Saab got a new life yesterday as General Motors Co.
agreed to sell the Swedish car brand to the small Dutch luxury.
GM to sell Saab for $74M

Dutch automaker
Spyker to purchase
troubled brand
DETROIT (AP) - A small
Dutch automaker will try to
do what U.S. auto giant Gen-
eral Motors Co. couldn't - make
money by selling Saab brand auto-
mobiles in an increasingly com-
petitive global marketplace.
GM signed a deal yesterday to
sell Saab to Spyker Cars NV for
$74 million in cash plus $326 mil-
lion worth of preferred shares in
Saab.
The deal hinges on a $550
million loan from the European
Investment Bank, which the
Swedish government on yesterday
committed to guaranteeing.
The sale is a coup for Spyker,
which is based in Zeewolde,
Netherlands, and a lifeline for
Saab, which has lost money ever
since GM bought a 50 percent
stake and management control
for $600 million in 1989. The
Detroit automaker gained full
ownership in 2000 for $125 mil-
lion more.
Saab employs around 3,500
people in Sweden and was within
days of liquidation as part of GM's
restructuring.
Now GM will continue provid-
ing vehicles and parts to the new
company, to be called Saab Spyker
Automobiles NV.
Spyker CEO Viktor Muller
knows that Spyker faces a huge
challenge to turn Saab into a
money maker, but said he's confi-

dent it can be done.
"I think what we can bring to
the table is entrepreneurship and
tenacity," he told reporters.
Saab already was struggling as
a niche brand with a small mar-
ket share when GM bought it, and
industry analysts say the Detroit
automaker ruined Saab's unique
character by supplying the unit
with vehicles designed for other
GM brands.
Before GM, Saab specialized
in egg-shaped aerodynamic small
cars with rapidly sloping backs
and four-cylinder engines. But
sales dropped as loyal followers
found the GM offerings no dif-
ferent than those made by other
mainstream brands.
But Muller said Spyker will
harness "the Swedishness of the
brand" to reconnect with Saab's
loyal following of 1.5 million driv-
ers.
"I think the unique heritage of
the brand requires a very strong
focus," he said. "If you are part
of a very large conglomerate, it's
very difficult to have focus on all.
these brands."
Spyker is estimating that it
will make 100,000 Saabs a year,
enough to be profitable. Asked
whether production would stay
in Sweden, Muller joked that it
would be shortsighted to believe
Saab buyers would remain loyal to
the brand if the cars were made in
Mumbai.
Spyker also must quickly sign
deals with GM or other automak-
ers to design and build new Saabs,
said Michael Robinet, an automo-
tive analyst with CSM Worldwide

in Michigan.
Without deals, Saab will have
to compete against global auto-
makers with much lower costs
that can pack features into their
cars and sell them for less, Robi-
net said.
"They have to find a friend or
work with other manufacturers
to bring in the products that they
want designed to their needs," he
said.
The sale came after an earlier
attempt to sell Saab to another
Swedish automaker fell through,
and after GM's bid to sell the Sat-
urn brand also collapsed. Pontiac
and Saturn now will be phased
out, and GM is trying to sell its
Hummer brand to a Chinese
heavy equipment maker.
Robinet said GM's board
pushed hard for the Saab sale,
forcing management to move
more quickly to focus on four core
brands: Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac
and GMC.
GM expects to close the sale by
mid-February. The company gets
a relatively small amount of cash
but it unloads an expense. GM
also retains the preferred shares,
giving it a stake should the com-
pany become profitable.
The Detroit auto giant will
continue to provide engines and
transmissions to Saab for "an
extended period of time," and it
will keep making the 9-4X cross-
over vehicle, said John Smith,
GM's vice president of planning
and alliances. Crossovers have the
interior room of an SUV but are
built on a car instead.of a truck

Speech will try to
move past recent
troubles for the
White House
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Barack Obama will try to pivot past
rocky times for the nation and him-
self tonight in his first State of the
Union address, offering a skeptical
public repackaged plans to energize
the economy, stem a tide of red ink
and strengthen anti-terror defenses.
He'll also be trying to revive his
own "yes we can" image.
One year into office, and a
week after pledging to do better at
"speaking directly to the American
people," Obama faces urgent chal-
lenges as he stands before lawmak-
ers gathered in the Capitol and a
prime-time television audience at
home for the constitutionally man-
dated ritual of U.S. governing. The
country has lost more than 7 mil-
lion jobs since the recession began
two years ago, unemployment is
stuck at 10 percent, and the govern-
ment is grapplingwith arecord $1.4
trillion deficit.
Obama's presidency is troubled
as well. The percentage of Ameri-
cans giving him a thumbs-up has
fallen precipitously, from 74 per-
cent when he took office to 56 per-
cent now. He hasn't had a breakout
legislative or diplomatic victory,
and he's failed to break Washing-

ton's partisanship as promised.
Then last week, an upset Repub-
lican victory in a Massachusetts
Senate race threw Obama's signa-
ture domestic priority, a sweeping
health care overhaul, into jeopar-
dy and shined a spotlight on eco-
nomic angst now being taken out
on him.
Among the expected ideas in
Obama's speech: an emphasis on
education, with calls for more
accountability for performance
but also more money to support
reforms. Obama's next budget
proposal is likely to suggest con-
solidating a series of elementary
and secondary school programs,
but overall, would increase Educa-
tion Department spending more by
than 6 percent.
Obama will be using one of the
presidency's loudest and grand-
est megaphones to press several
themes. They will be fleshed out
in greater detail afterward as the
president travels to Florida on
Thursday and New Hampshire on
Tuesday for jobs-focused appear-
ances and when he submits his 2011
budget to Congress on Monday.
Republican Gov. Bob McDon-
nell of Virginia will deliver a
televised response tonight, two
months after putting his state in
GOP hands in one of the party's
major recent election victories.

messages Obama will weave

China issues warning of
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan

Issue raises tensions
between Beijing
and Washington
BEIJING (AP) - Contacts with
China's military would likely be
the first to suffer if Beijing moves
to retaliate over upcoming U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan - the lat-
est in a flurry of disputes elevat-
ing tensions between Washington
and Beijing.
Foreign Ministryspokesman Ma
Zhaoxu warned that the Obama
administration risked damaging
ties with China if it proceeds with
the arms package deal, which is
likely to include Black Hawk heli-
copters and Patriot missiles.
"Once again, we urge the U.S.
side to recognize the sensitivity
of weapon sales to Taiwan and its
gravity," Ma told reporters yes-
terday at a regularly scheduled
news conference. He said failure
to halt the sales would "impair

the larger interests of China-U.S
cooperation."
Ma's comments were echoed
last week by the Cabinet's Taiwan
Affairs Office which handles con-
tacts with Taiwan, considered by
Beijing to be a breakaway province.
"Our stance of opposing arms
sales to Taiwan by any country
is consistent and clear," spokes-
man Yang Yi said. "We feel that
advancing the peaceful develop-
ment of cross-strait relations is
the only real way to benefit Tai-
wan's peace and stability."
Weapons sales to self-governing
Taiwan is one of a string of sensi-
tive issues roiling ties between
China and the United States that
have prompted pointed responses
from Beijing.
Last week, China issued a
sharp counterattack after U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton criticized Internet

censorship and called on China
to investigate cyberattacks
against Google. The search giant
has threatened to pull out of the
world's most populous online
market if Beijing doesn't relax its
Internet censorship.
Yesterday, another government
spokesman rebuked Washington
for Clinton's comments, saying
they aimed to discredit China. An
editorial in the official People's
Daily the same day accused U.S.
politicians of using the issue to
"meddle in other nations' affairs
on the one hand and to con-
solidate American hegemony in
cyberspace on the other hand."
Arms sales to Taiwan are man-
dated by a U.S. law requiring
Washington to ensure Taiwan is
capable of defending itself from
Chinese threats, including the
more than 1,000 ballistic missiles
pointed at the island.

Pakistani scientist
accused of shooting
U.S. Army personnel
NEW YORK (AP) - Lawyers
for aPakistani scientist accused of
shooting at U.S. Army personnel
in Afghanistan asked a judge yes-
terday to stop her from testifying,
saying her "diminished capacity"
would result in a "painful spec-
tacle indeed."
Lawyers for Aafia Siddiqui
said verbally and in a letter to
Judge Richard M. Berman that
the 37-year-old Pakistani scien-
tist should not be allowed to tes-
tify when the defense case begins
today despite her repeated stat-
ed desire to do so. Prosecutors
declined to immediately comment
on their opinion regarding the
request.
Siddiqui's trial, which began
with opening statements last
week, has featured repeated out-
bursts by Siddiqui in which she
decries the court proceedings as
unfair and challenges the testi-
mony of government witnesses.
She has been escorted from court
several times.

Siddiqui's lawyers said there is
precedent for denying the right
to testify to a defendant who has
been disruptive in court and who
intends to testify about issues that
are not relevant to the charges.
The lawyers wrote that their
client's desire to testify "are driv-
en by an irrational and- delusional
belief that she can convince lis-
teners that she can bring world
peace."
In a footnote, they said their
conversations with her regarding
what she would talk about if she
testifies show that her perceived
ability "to bring world peace,
especially between the United
States and the Taliban, appears to
be the primary, if not sole, topic."
Siddiqui is on trial on charges
that she attempted to murder U.S.
Army officers and FBI agents in an
Afghan police station in July 2008
by picking up a rifle and firing it as
she was about to be questioned.
U.S. authorities say it happened
as she was about to be questioned
after she was caught a day earlier
carrying handwritten notes ref-
erencing a "mass casualty attack"
and listing the Brooklyn Bridge,
Statue of Liberty and other New
York City landmarks.

Mind over money
University presidents should work for a purpose, not a salary
t may come as a surprise to some to learn that University
President Mary Sue Coleman makes more than the president
of the United States. The U.S. president makes a base salary
of $400,000, while Coleman receives a base salary of $553,500.
And, when you factor in other bonuses from the University, her
total compensation package comes to a whopping $783,850 this
year. But as steep as Coleman's salary is, what's more troubling is
the increase of presidents' salaries across the country. University
presidents - including Coleman - should reject high salaries to
show their commitment to the mission of public education.

According to data released by The
Chronicle of Higher Education last week,
Coleman is the sixth highest-paid public
university president in the country. Cole-
man has declined in salary ranking over
the past few years, falling from the highest-
paid public university president in 2002 and
fifth in 2008. Despite the fact that Coleman
accepted a 4-percent base salary raise in
the 2009 fiscal year, she ranked sixth this
year behind presidents at the University of
Washington, the University of Delaware,
the University of virginia, the University of
Texas and Ohio State University.
Previous University presidents haven't
been paid nearly as highly as Coleman.
Former University President Lee Bollinger
earned $326,550 in 2001, the year before he
resigned from his position at the Universi-
ty of Michigan and became the president of
Columbia University. Though some of the
difference can be attributed to inflation,
the wide disparity shows that universities
have started to shift their priorities. Cole-
man's exorbitant compensation is remi-
niscent of a for-profit private sector rather
than a public service salary.
Coleman's high salary is indicative of
a disturbing trend in public education:
increasing administrative salaries. The
purpose of public education has gotten
lost amid the high-stakes competition for

the best president, which comes complete
with high salaries and monetary competi-
tion. Though the argument that the Uni-
versity must offer a competitive salary to
retain Coleman's services may be a reality,
it is representative of the core problem now
facing public education. The focus of many
public universities has shifted from educa-
tioi to enterprise, making salary figures
more important than the mission of uni-
versities: to educate. Those who work in
public education shouldn't do so because of
the monetary rewards, but rather because
of the purpose of improving students' edu-
cation and lives.
And though salary costs are only a drop
in the bucket of costs that have trickled
down to students through tuition, those
in public education should never be paid
at the expense of those they are meant to
serve. Presidents' places at state-funded
universities shouldn't be motivated by
money. It should be motivated by a genuine
dedication to public education and admira-
tion for academic prestige. As long as the
presidents of public universities accept
high salaries, they aren't showing that
dedication.
Public education should go back to its
roots. And that begins, at least symboli-
cally, by lowering the salaries of university
presidents.

t's time for the truth, Univer-
sity of Michigan community. I,
Rachel Van Gilder, The Michi-
gan Daily's edito-
rial page editor,
am a self-identified
Republican. That's
right. You heard
me. I don't sup-
port affirmative
action, abortion or
stem cell research, ( ,
and I felt a twinge
of schadenfreude RACHEL
when Republican
Scott Brown won
the open Massa-
chusetts Senate
seat last week,
placing a potential stumbling block
in the way of Democrats' costly
health care bill. I'm a social and fis-
cal conservative.
I can imagine campus's response
to this news. Members of the College
Republicans are high-fiving, imagin-
ing that the Daily will now endorse
only red candidates and denounce
President Barack Obama at every
opportunity. The College Democrats,
meanwhile, are throwing down the
paper in ahuff, outraged that a con-
servative could take the reins of the
historically progressive Daily opin-
ion page. But campus. liberals and
conservatives alike can be assured
that in reality, nothing's going to
change: The Daily is still the paper
it has always been, and its editorial
stances aren't going to suddenly take
a one-eighty now that I'm the edito-
rial page editor.
I always see eyebrows shoot up in
surprise when I inform people that,
yes, I work for the Daily's opinion
section and that, yes, I'm a conser-
vative. The Daily's editorial reputa-
tion precedes it, and I would classify
the Daily as a liberal paper. I would
also say that I disagree with about

half of the Daily's editorials. But I'm
perfectly capable of upholding the
Daily's precedent without agreeing
with it.
"How?" I can almost hear liber-
als and conservatives alike gasp in
confusion. How can you write about
things you don't agree with? Isn't
that wrong? Doesn't that feel dishon-
est? And these are valid concerns -
ones I myself have had to resolve.
It helps that many Daily editorial
stances are on issues that most stu-
dents, regardless of party lines, can
agree on. For example, most students
agree that the Michigan Student
Assembly isn't living up to its poten-
tial to better students' lives. They
also agree that textbooks are too
expensive, and that a quality educa-
tion is important.
But though I'm not a far-right con-
servative, and I'm not conservative
on every issue, I do disagree with the
Daily on a lot of issues. I can usually
reconcile the differences because of
my outlook on party politics. You may
label me naive for thinking so, but I'm
of the opinion that most people are,
in general, good people. That means
that, while I don't agree with liber-
als on most things, I can respect that
they're coming from a good place.
I view party politics in terms of
values. As a conservative, I value per-
sonal responsibility. Liberals place
more value on social responsibility.
This doesn't mean that conservatives
don't care about other people, or that
liberals have no sense of personal
accountability. It simply means that
each party has prioritized their val-
ues, and one has come out on top.
And one thingthat Ivalue above all
- and that the Daily values - is dis-
cussion.And that's what I reallythink
the Daily's opinion page is about.
In reality, polarized thinking never
makes for good law. Both sides serve
a purpose in the lawmaking process:

Liberals' idealism pushes the status
quo that conservatives often hold,
and conservatives' steadfast practi-
cality grounds necessary change in
realism. Talking about issues is the
only way to find the middle ground
that actually leads to the best policy.
This belief is what makes doing this
job possible - and worth it.
It's not my place
to reinvent the
Daily's identity.
Honestly, though, sometimes it's
hard to edit and defend positions that
I don't agree with. When the Daily
tackles issues that I have strong moral
objections to, like stem cell research,
I sometimes get an ashen taste in my
mouth. I have to make a concerted
effort to leave my feelings at the door.
I shut those feelings out, and focus on
my job: to make the Daily's editorials
as logical as possible.
I do it because I've realized some,
thing during my rise from Edito-
rial Board member to editorial page
editor: The Daily isn't about me. It's
much, much bigger than simply me
and my opinions. The Daily is its own
entity that has developed its own
opinions and thoughts over decades,
and it's not my place to reverse its
legacy. I'm just one part of the insti-
tution, and my views don't drown
out 120 years of precedent. The
Daily's editorials are usually liberal.
And they will remain liberal - even
though I'm a conservative.

The better clean-up crew

Do you know why it's hotter in the summer
than in the winter? If your answer has to do
with the Earth's tilt, then congratulations! By
the standards of scientist Robert M. Hazen,
you can brag that you're more "scientifically
literate" than 90 percent of Harvard Univer-
sity's graduating class of 2002. A few weeks
ago I was assigned to read Dr. Hazen's article
- which argues that even non-scientific people
should understand basic scientific concepts -
in a science class that I'm only taking to finish
my natural science requirement. Speaking as a
non-scientific person, I'm not convinced that
knowledge of the Earth's tilt is ever going to be
a useful piece of information in my life.
The logic behind the naturalscience require-
ment is essentially the same as Dr. Hazen's.
The Collge of Literature, Science and the Arts
wants all students to graduate with enough
general scientific knowledge to comprehend
the scientific debates that occur during their
lifetimes. But as far as I can tell, most attempts
by science professors to provide life lessons for
students who will never be taking another sci-
ence class again are laughable.
One common activity in biology or environ-
ment classes is for students to measure their
individual carbon footprints. Aside from the
fact that this tends to be done via a shoddy
looking Internet site that asks no more than ten
questions about your individual carbon usage, I
have little faith in the value of such an activity
anyways. I doubt that it convinces many stu-
dents to suddenly recycle their beer cans and
monitor the amount of water they use when
they shower.
Nearly all classes that fulfill the natural
science requirement focus on too much infor-
mation that is useless to non-science majors.
I don't care about the names of the Earth's
biomes or the classification of vertebrates. I
bet that I would be much more interested in
a class called "Environmental and Resource
Economics" than a class called "Ecological
Issues." But guess which one fulfills the natu-
ral science requirement.

The problem is that science classes are being
taught in a vacuum. There isn't enough discus-
sion about how ecological issues take place in
a political and economic environment. It's too
easy for students to walk out of a biology class
feeling guilty for about ten minutes before con-
tinuing to resume their lives as normal. If the
two classes mentioned above were merged into
a class that counted towards the natural sci-
ence requirement, the resulting class would
be way more beneficial to non-science majors
than the current options.
This is why I propose the creation of a new
natural science course specifically geared
towards people who aren't majoring in a sci-
ence. It would be called, "What you need to
know about science...really." While I'm not a
professor, here are some ideas for topics that
I think would provide more beneficial discus-
sions for students who will only be taking two
science courses at this school:
First: There are many educational initiatives
about the environment - like the University's
"Planet Blue" initiative - that seek to convince
individuals to change their routine behaviors
for the benefit of the environment. What are
the qualities of an effective initiative?
Second: If a large mass of people in an area
where there is an abundance of water decides
to drastically reduce its water usage, will that
help people who live in an area where there is a
shortage of water?
Third: If a country, such as the United States,
signs an international agreement to reduce its
carbon usage, how would it go about doing
that? Is cap-and-trade enough?
I'm sure that science majors have similar
complaints about their distribution require-
ments. But requirements aren't going to go
away, no matter how much we complain about
them. Seeing as most of us non-science folks
are not going to take Orgo or neuro-biology,
something can be changed to make the avail-
able options more applicable to our lives.
Jeremy Levy is an LSA sophomore.

These days, the Obama admin-
istration can't get anything
right. It failed to adopt an
effective strategy
with respect to
health care reform,
and instead for-
warded a policy of
compromise that
forced President
Barack Obama to
make repeated
concessions while
allowing the TOMMASO
Republican minor- PAVONE
ity to frame the
health care debate.
It, in the words of
Vice President Joe Biden, "guessed
wrong" regarding the longevity and
severity of our current economic
downturn, predicting much rosier
unemployment rates than actually
occurred. Then its promise to begin
a phased withdrawal from Iraq and
Afghanistan was replaced by a politi-
cally sour surge of troops in Afghani-
stan. Its pledge to end the military's
"don't ask, don't tell" policy has been
abandoned - at least for the time
being. What happened to the hope
and change we were promised?
I understand it has only been a year
since Obama assumed office, but it's
clear that the Obama team has had
trouble transforming an energized
and relatively flawless campaign
model into a policymaking model. No
wonder morale among Democrats has
plummeted. Republican Scott Brown's
surprising win in the Massachusetts
U.S. Senate race last week perfectly
encapsulates and foreshadows a grow-
ing problem of Democratic malaise. If
a state where only 12 percent of reg-
istered voters identify themselves as
Republicans elected a conservative
to replace the late Edward Kennedy,
famously known as the "liberal lion
,of the Senate," the Democrats should

know they're in trouble.
In short, despite the left's claims,
Obama and the Democrats' perfor-
mance has been less than satisfy-
ing. In such disappointing times, the
temptation is to stab the Democrats in
the back and elect some good-lookin',
truck-drivin', tax-cuttin', gun-ownin'
Republicans like Brown.
The problem with such a strategy:
Republicans have largely been worse
than the Democrats.
Let's remember that for the vast
majority of George W. Bush's dreadful
tenure in the White House, Congres-
sional Republicans were more than
happy to rubber-stamp his propos-
als. Let's not forget that the economic
recession was in large part caused by
a relaxation of financial regulation, a
cause championed by the Right. And
let's keep in mind that a majority of
Republicans still denies that climate
change is occurring. Or consider their
eagerness to kill health care reform
without making any concrete alterna-
tive proposals. And, while we're at this
depressing exercise, let's recall all the
moronic statements Sarah Palin made
- such as referring to Africa as a coun-
try - even as she is lauded as a poten-
tial savior of the Republican party.
All this would be irrelevant if the
Republicans showed any sign ofrepen-
tance, but they seem more defiant now
than ever before, uniting against any
Democratic efforts at reform. And the
consequences of placing yourself on
the opposite end of change amount to
indirectly promoting the status quo
fostered under the Bush administra-
tion. Indeed, despite the criticisms of
the Bush years, the Republicans seem
determined to re-institute the Bush
era under the guise of opposition to
Obama's supposedly "socialist" agen-
da. When I think about the Repub-
lican platform for the 2010 midterm
elections, I'm left to borrow from the
rhetoric of their beloved late President

Ronald Reagan: "There you go again!"
Let me relate the current situation
to the case of my home country of
Italy. The current Italian Prime Min-
ister, Silvio Berlusconi, is considered
by many to be an undignified and cor-
rupt politician with the added ben-
efit of being the laughingstock of the
international community. So why do
Italians keep electing him? Because
the left - mostly composed of com-
munist politicians who conveniently
became champions of democracy after
the fall of the Soviet Union - isn't any
better. Just because the ruling party
is less than satisfying is no reason to
shoot yourself in the foot and support
the opposition in backlash against the
Democrats and without any consider-
ation of the Republican platform - or
lack thereof.
The GOP couldn't
fix the country's
problems either.
Looking forward to the midterm
elections later this year, I think it's
likely that the Democratic majority
in Congress will evaporate. No doubt,
the Democrats will largely have them-
selves to blame for the losses. But I ask
you to consider if Democratic under-
performance is any reason to reward
the Republican Party - a party that
latelyhashad no ideasexceptbadideas.
Gloomy times call for gloomy mea-
sures. Sometimes the least worst
option is the best option. It's time to
hold your nose and give the Democrats
a second chance.

Not so 'Lovely Bones'
Peter Jackson loses his epic filmmaking,
keeps his inability to effectively end a film
By Imran Syed Daily Arts Writer

'Deep End':
juris coitus

Although he will always be
remembered as director of the
monumental "Lord of the Rings"
trilogy, Peter
Jackson will
also go down in
history as the Lovely
greatest direc-
tor who never BIeS
learned how to At Quality16
end a film. From and Showcase
the half dozen paramount
different end-
ing sequences
that plagued the last hour of "The
Return of the King" to the gruel-
ing, soppy 187-minute run time
of "King Kong," we've come to
expect long-windedness from this
three-time Oscar winner.
Unlike those other films (which
were masterpieces on the whole),
Jackson's latest film, "The Lovely
Bones," suffers from more con-
ventional flaws in addition to its
inexplicably abrupt and altogeth-
er unsatisfying ending.
Based on the popular novel by
Alice Sebold, "The Lovely Bones"
is a rather jarring story of serial
child rapist/murderer Mr. Harvey
(played with disturbing calm by
Stanley Tucci, "Julie and Julia")
and his latest victim, Susie Salm-

on (Saoirse Ronan, "Atonement").
The killer does to Susie what he
has done to numerous other girls
in the past, but Susie doesn't quite
die. Instead, she passes into "the
in-between," whence she can
watch over her family and mur-
derer - and narrate the film.
Necessarily, the film tackles
many of the heavy themes that
pervaded Sebold's novel, though it
seems hesitant to do so. Cut from
the plot are the most graphic and
disturbing aspects of the story
(the rape and the killer's dismem-
berment of the body are never
even mentioned).
The suffering and conflict
of Susie's parents (Mark Wahl-
berg, "The Departed" and Rachel
Weisz, "The Constant Gardener")
are related in a greatly sterilized
manner. Even Tucci's take on
Harvey, though certainly master-
ful in its minimalism, seems cen-
sored rather than measured.
Perhaps it was the film's insis-
tence on broad appeal (a PG-13
rating) that compelled such modi-
fications, but other cuts seem less
explicable and rob viewers of a
sense of wholeness for the story.
As she struggles with whether
she should nudge her family to

I was tripping balls, but then I fell. Is this gonna be forever?"

keep pursuing her killer, Sebold's
Susie discovers her killer's own
troubled childhood and develop a
begrudging sympathy toward him
in the novel. The film forgoes this
element, leaving viewers to deal
with a grotesque villain who is
alarmingly one-dimensional. As
great as Tucci's performance is,
his character is simply too easy to
hate for a film that means to evoke
such moral complexity.
Jackson's conception of "the
in-between," a magical land that
isn't quite heaven, is beautiful but
incomplete. We never learn exactly
why Susie is there, what she is sup-
posed to learn or if she ever does
learn it. These are without a doubt

the most meaningful questions con-
cerningthe core of the storybutthe
film avoids them until its rushed
last couple of minutes. When Susie
finishes her closing monologue
with "I will you all a long and happy
life," viewers are left only to chuck-
le, having missed out on the emo-
tional and psychological gravity
those words ought to evoke coming
from a murdered child.
While thoughtfully shot and
certainly not a disaster, "The
Lovely Bones" is, more than any-
thing else, incomplete. Its attempt
to tell an extremely graphic story
with marked minimalism does
ultimately succeed, but far too
much is lost in translation.

"The Deep End" can't help but
leave viewers wondering if every
law firm is just a front for a book-
filled, gavel-
smacking sexual
playground.
The show fol-T
lows the careers
of a new group End
of lawyers in a Thursdays
competitive and at8yp.m.
wealthy firm as
they deal with ABC
insecurities, cor-
ruption, moral dilemmas and, most
importantly, sexual quandaries.
Liam Priory (Ben Lawson, "Neigh-
bours") gives a fine example of that
last concern when a Jewish client
becomes magnetically attracted
to him (and, more importantly, to
the yarmulke his boss made him
wear) but comes to find he has not,
in fact, been circumcised. This is a
fact explained by one of the other
up-and-cominglawyers, as she has
personal experience with the mat-
ter (and member) in question. By
the end of the episode, it feels like
each and every character is con-
nected, not by a passion for the
justice system, but by a line of com-
mon hookups.
"The Deep End," while subpar, is
buoyed by a cast of fairly competent
actors. Rowdy Kaiser (Norbert Leo
Butz, "Dan in Real Life") is espe-
cially likeable, even managingto be
funny at times. Protagonist Dylan
Hewitt (Matt Long, "Ghost Rider")
on the other hand, was clearly cho-
sen for aesthetic appeal. Long is a
capable actor, but his character is
bland and morally superior in an
obnoxious way. He brings flowers
to the colleague he has chosen to
sleep with this week. This black-
and-white morality will quickly
become dull in a show like "The
Deep End." If it lasts, they'd better

spice him up with a drug problem
or something.
Beth Branford (Leah Pipes,
"Sorority Row") offers a more mor-
ally gray character, and strangely, a
female with daddy issues. There's
a first. But among the more grat-
ing characters are "the prince of
darkness" boss Cliff Huddle (Billy
Zane, "Samantha Who?"), who
is insufferable purely because of
Zane's terrible performance, and
Addy Fisher (Tina Majorino, "Big
Love"), whose coming-of-age story
is far too obvious and packed into
one episode.
Fisher is that archetypal charac-
ter who lets everyone take advan-
tage of her until her moment of
clarity, when she gets fed up and
takes what she wants. Except she
manages to be whiny and annoying
even after she grows a backbone.
Why does each and every drama
have to include the same stereo-
type?
It's 'Grey's
Anatomy' in the
court room.
A counterpart for each fresh
young lawyer can be found in
"Grey's Anatomy," and this may
be intentional. After all, there's
clearly a market for that type of
drama ("Grey's" is on its sixth sea-
son now), and a law firm can offer
as tense and dramatic a setting as a
hospital.
In the end, "The Deep End" is
a decently executed combination
of "Grey's Anatomy" and "Private
Practice" plopped down into a dif-
ferent setting. While it offers noth-
ing groundbreaking or original, it
does occasionally manage to enter-
tain.

The members of Surfer Blood
don't actually surf. Despite hail-
ing from the sun-kissed coasts
of West Palm
Beach, Fla., the
(very) young
musicians in Suffer Blood
this quirky four-
some spent their Astro Coast
youth jammin' Kanine
to indie pop
tunes instead of
catching waves. Its name, which
came to be after a night of heavy
drinking, refers more to the joys
of underage drunken banter than
the cocky surf-heads dominating
the Florida coast.
On Surfer Blood's debut Astro
Coast, the band manages to meld
its hometown's sunny aesthetic
with a distinctively to-fi produc-
tion for a catchy collection of
tracks recalling old-school Weezer
with a Beach Boys flavor. The curi-
ous combination of artistic influ-
ences is largely a success, allowing
the band to infuse different genres
with its own adolescent energy.
Astro Coast's production his-
tory is a teenage garage band's
dream. According to the band's

MySpace bio, the album was orig-
inally recorded in a proper stu-
dio, but lead singer/guitarist JP
Pitts was disappointed with the
crisp production sound and pre-
ferred a fuzzier to-fi feel. Using
instruments purchased with
scholarship cash, the band then
re-recorded its debut in a fresh-
man dorm room at the Univer-
sity of Florida, thereby capturing
the stripped-down aura Pitts was
searching for.
Slowly building blog buzz over
the past few months, Surfer Blood
has emerged at the forefront of the
quirky beach-bumglo-fi movement.
With distorted vocals and simplis-
tic strings,Astro Coast captures the
band's youthful exuberance while
emphasizing its sunny roots, creat-
ing the perfect album for lazy sum-
mertime jaunts to the shore.
Opening with "Floating Vibes,"
the band immediately introduces
its chilled-out, eclectic sound by
combining Joy Division-influenced
riffs with Rivers Cuomo-esque
vocals. Although the band eschews
any relation to surfer culture, the
song is packed with references
to the sport, professing "If you're
movin' out to the West / Then
you'd better learn how to surf."

Swensen asks 'U' about poetry


By HEATHER POOLE
Daily Arts Writer
Poetry may seem a stagnant
medium to some - a long-winded
use of language well past its hey-
day. But poet
Cole Swensen is
hoping to bring
poetry back as a SWengg
relevant force in
modern culture. Tomorrow at
Tomorrow, 5:15 p.m.
Swensen vis- Helmut Sterm
its the Univer- Auditorium
sity of Michigan Ftee
Museum of Art to
conduct an open-ended discussion
with students about the future of
poetry.
"I'm interested in finding out
how (the students) see poetry fit-
ting into contemporary culture
and where they would like it to go,"
Swensen wrote in an e-mail inter-
view with the Michigan Daily.
Swensen is a part of the Zell Vis-
iting Writers Series. Hosted by the
Department of English, the series
brings notable writers to the Uni-
versity each semester.
Linda Gregerson, the Caroline
Walker Bynum Distinguished Uni-
versity Professor of English and
professor of creative writing and
Renaissance literature, has a per-

ceptive appreciation for the series.
"Our own faculty is remarkably
distinguished and diverse," Greger-
son wrote in an e-mail interview,
"but we cannot of course compre-
hend all the important develop-
ments in contemporary prose and
poetry writing.
"So we use the Visiting Writers
Series to augment our roster, sharing
with writing students, the Universi-
ty at large, and the wider communi-
ty, a vital array of writers, both new
and established," she added.
Swensen's work is diverse and
nationally recognized. She thrives
in the realm of literature. As the
author of 12 books of poetry and a
translator of French poetry, prose
and art criticism, Swenson has won
of several awards, including the
National Poetry Series and the San
Francisco State Poetry Center Book
Award.
Swensen has always dedicated
herself to poetry. She grew up in an
environment that allowed for artis-
tic expression, as her mother was a
painter.
"I wrote stories as a young child,
but bythe time I was 11 or 12, I knew
it was poetry that I wanted to write,"
Swensen wrote. "Fortunately, I got
a lot of support from teachers and
family, and Ijustkeptwriting."
Swensen's dedication to her work

has resulted in her continued suc-
cess. Her most recent book, "Ours,"
was a finalist for the Los Angeles
Times Book Award.
"Ours" has resonated with Gre-
gerson, in particular.
"Cole Swensen's most recent
book, 'Ours,' is one of the most
thrilling books of poetry I know:
beautifully cadenced, lucid, and
intellectually resonant," Gregerson
wrote.
"It's based on the work of 17th-
century landscape architect Andre
Le Notre, who designed, among
many others, the gardens at Ver-
sailles," Gregerson added. "Swensen
brings beautifully to life the per-
sonal, cultural, and philosophical
context in which Le Notre worked."
Although Swensen did not spec-
ify any overall themes that apply to
her work, she did acknowledge her
focus on a specific type of poetry.
"I'm interested in what's called
'ekphrasis,' poetry written about
art. I'm interested in how the tradi-
tion ofthe subgenre can be changed,
augmented," Swensen wrote.
With ekphrasis as her inspira-
tion, Swensen has been able to
explore a variety of subjects in her
poetry.,
"The themes keep changing, but
they often have something to do
with the arts, gardens, opera, land-

scape painting, and illuminated
manuscripts are all subjects I've
used in my work," she wrote.
"I like to use poetry as a mode of
research," she added. "It seems to
me that poetry can get to aspects
of subjects that prose writing can't,
so to pick a subject that is usually
approached by prose can be very
rewarding."
Through her poetry, Swensen
hopes her audience will be able to
vicariously experience the intended
emotions.
"I hope to evoke in readers the
same feelingthatIhave in response.
to these arts, instances, and objects,
and that feeling is usually wonder,
awe, hope," she wrote.
As for her goals for the future,
Swensen expressed an interest in
continuing to expand the use of
poetry.
"Sd like to improve the use of
poetry as an investigative tool," she
added.
Swensen has managed to utilize
poetry in a way that, according to
Gregerson, is "immediate and bril-
liantly accessible" in today's world.
Her versatility and passion have
made her a distinguished and well
established poet who will be able to
provide valuable insight to students
interested in careers associated
with literature.

HANLON
From Page 1A
the midst of a retention battle
with the University of North Car-
olina at Chapel Hill over Hanlon.
According to UNC's website, Han-
lon was one of four finalists for
the executive vice chancellor and
provost position at the institution
before he withdrew his name and
was named the next University of
Michigan provost.
"Dr. Hanlon has withdrawn
consideration to accept another
position," a statement on UNC-
Chapel Hill's website stated.
Coleman said the very real pos-
sibility of losing Hanlon was a
major factor in why she acted so
quickly to name Sullivan's replace-
ment.
"His candidacy at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
put things in a very tight time-
frame," she said.
Hanlon's institutional knowl-
edge made him essential to retain
in the office of Provost, Coleman
said.
"That was one of the key factors
in the decision, because I think
inevitably if you do a national
search it takes a year and I was
very concerned about losing the
whole brain trust of the budget
construction, which is in Phil
Hanlon's bailiwick along with
Terry Sullivan," Coleman said.
In fact, Coleman said the rea-
son she consulted privately with
leaders on campus - as opposed
to forming a search committee -
was, at least in part, because she
feared losing Hanlon to UNC.
"All my time, basically over the
last two weeks, has been devoted
to this," Coleman said. "I didn't
have a search committee. I was
trying to get as much input as I
could because I knew I didn't have
the luxury of time."
"If it hadn't been for his can-
didacy elsewhere and the risk of
losing him," Coleman said before
stopping mid-sentence and pon-
dering whether under different
circumstances she would have
considered a national search.
"Whether I would have done
an internal search or a national
search, that was a question I
actually thought about but didn't
end up confronting because of
the timeline I had with (Han-
lon)."
In the end, Coleman said she
was very happy that Hanlon
agreed to stay at the University
and accept the position as provost
and executive vice president for
academic affairs.
"I wanted us to have a lot of
experience in that office and so
I was thrilled that he agreed to
accept the position," she said.
"I think it will be a very smooth
transition in a time when we all
know the state is going to be fac-
ing some real budget challenges
and we've got to keep the Univer-
sity strong."
In an interview with the Daily
yesterday, Hanlon said he feels
honored to'have the opportunity
to serve as the next University
provost.
"I'm excited to the join the team
in this new role," Hanlon said. "It's
apoint intime where the Universi-
ty is facing some really interesting
challenges and opportunities and
there's just a terrific leadership
team in place at the University all
the way from the president, Board

of Regents, executive officers and

go toward these projects," he
said.
Rapundalo said the city will
face significant budget shortfalls
in the coming years. He added
that the two proposals his com-
mittee recommended would pro-
vide the city with financial return
instead of costing it money.
Rapundalo said the three pro-
posals that were rejected by the
committee did not provide ade-
quate cost estimates.
Two of these proposals called
for "open spaces" on the site -
parks that would have served as
social gathering spots for city
residents.
"While (the parks) are idyllic,
the fact of the matter is that they
do cost money," Rapundalo said.

throughout the semester to pro-
mote the program and get more
students to register.
"I'm really confident that that
number will rise," Serwer said.
Though the program was

deans all the way down."
Hanlon said once Coleman had
inquired about his interest in the
position, he didn't have to think
very hard before he decided to
accept the offer.
"I thought I was probably one
of the people who was in a posi-
tion to move easily into the role,
just because of the work I've been
doing," Hanlon said. "So I wasn't
entirely surprised, but of course
there are lots of very talented peo-
ple who can do this job, both here
and nationally. So I was flattered
that she was talking to me."
And despite the natural fit,
Hanlon said he hadn't really ever
thought about becoming the Uni-
versity's provost until after Sul-
livan announced her intention to
leave the University this summer.
"This actually happened pret-
ty quickly," he said. "I really
didn't give much thought to who
would be her successor until that
moment when (Sullivan) made the
announcement."
Hanlon said following the
announcement, Coleman contact-
ed him to gauge his interest in the
position.
"President Coleman actually
contacted me pretty quickly after
that to explore my interest. It's a
really exciting opportunity," Han-
lon said. "I was pretty excited by
the opportunity when it was pre-
sented."
Though less than 24 hours after
being officially named the Uni-
versity's next provost, Hanlon
admitted he's already been think-
ing about possible changes he may
make after taking the reins.
While he considers those pos-
sibilities, Hanlon said he will con-
tinue to have a lot of work to do in
his current job.
"Well, I have to do my current
job," he said. "I have to help the
provost, the president and the
regents put together a budget for
next year."
Aside from his current duties,
Hanlon said be would also begin
conversations with students, fac-
ulty and staff about the future to
better prepare him in planning for
when he assumes the role of pro-
vost.
In addition, Hanlon said he
would need to begin searching for
someone to take over his current
position of vice provost of aca-
demic and budgetary affairs.
And while he says he's already
thinking about potential changes,
Hanlon said he believes the Uni-
versity is in a good enough posi-
tion that major changes are not
necessary.
"The University of Michigan
is a very high performing univer-
sity," Hanlon said. "I see opportu-
nities, I see challenges that I'd like
to work on, but I think a radical
transformation of the University
is not called for at this point."
In interviews with the Daily
yesterday, several regents and
University officials praised Han-
lon's selection, saying his previous
experience wouldbe a tremendous
asset to the University.
Dean of Libraries Paul Courant,
who served as University provost
from 2002 to 2005, said he was
very pleased with yesterday's
announcement.
"It's a very good appointment,"
Courant said. "I think it's impor-
tant and good for the University
that there be continuity in the
office."
Though some may view the

search as having a quick turn-

around, Courant said there's really
no typical time period for a search
of this nature.
"There is no normal. Sometimes
there is an elaborate national
search for a position like this - in
fact there was a big search when
Provost Sullivan was named," he
said. "Not uncommonly, a presi-
dent will look around, consult
with some people and make an
appointment of somebody who is
here and ready to do the job."
Courantwas provostwhen Han-
lon first joined the provost's office
staff. Even at that time, Courant
said he believed Hanlon may one
day be a university provost.
"It's not uncommon for people
to roll from that position to a pro-
vost position here or elsewhere,"
Courant said. "Part of what you're
doing when you hire a person into
a job at that level is thinking about
whether this is someone who can
move even further. But it's by no
means a sure thing."
However, Courant - who
made the same transition from
vice provost to provost - said the
new position will be a significant
change for Hanlon.
"A big difference is the provost
is a much more public figure than
the vice provost for budget," Cou-
rant said.
"The vice provost for budget
does a lot of important work, insid-
ers know who he or she is and all
that, but when you're the provost
you're the chief academic officer
of this great university and you're
always speaking for the University
and it's quality wherever you are,
whatever you're doing," Courant
continued. "It's a bigger job."
Despite the differences Hanlon
will face in his new position, Cou-
rant said he expects Hanlon will
rise to the occasion.
"I expect he'll do very well in
this job," Courant said.
Regent Andrea Fischer-New-
man (R-Ann Arbor) said in an
interview yesterday that she
thought that despite the relative-
ly quick turnaround she felt the
decision was appropriate, since
Coleman had likely been planning
for such a scenario in advance.
"This is something that prob-
ably didn't come as a surprise,"
Newman said. "(Coleman and
Sullivan) didn't sit down one day
two weeks ago and say 'Hey, what
should we do? Let's go look."'
"Terry is a very attractive can-
didate, as are others for other
jobs, and education headhunters
are everywhere," Newman said.
"I think this is a natural thing to
do."
Newman added that based on
her conversations with Coleman
prior to the announcement, she
believed Coleman was very pas-
sionate about Hanlon's selection.
"Based on what she told me, she
felt very strongly about it," New-
man said. "I think she was very
comfortable with this decision
very quickly."
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) told the Daily yesterday
that she too was very happy Han-
lon would be the next provost.
"We couldn't be more fortunate
that he's here and has accepted
the position," Darlow said.
Darlow said Hanlon's experi-
ence, which includes working in
the office of the Provost for the
last several years, will help Han-
lon to make a quick transition.
"Among the tremendous assort-
ment of qualities he brings is his

expertise of the budget," she said.

"It's more than hitting the ground
running, he's already running on
the budget issues."
Darlow added that Hanlon will
bring other assets to the table,
including a wealth of institutional
knowledge and quality relation-
ships with University leaders.
"He has tremendous respect
from the faculty and the whole
University community," Darlow
added.
Regent Andrew Richner
(R-Grosse Pointe Park), who cur-
rently serves as the chair of the
Board of Regents, cited similar
qualifications and said he whole-
heartedly supports choosing Han-
lon as the next provost.
"of course I know Phil well
and I've worked closely with him
over the years through his posi-
tion in the provost's office and in
my opinion, Mary Sue has chosen
wisely," Richner said. "He is, in
one word, brilliant."
Richner added that, given the
high caliber of faculty and staff at
the University, choosing an inter-
nal candidate made sense in this
case.
"We're fortunate to have the
depth of talent that we do within
the provost's office and within the
University as a whole," Richner
said. "Given that we have that tal-
ent from which to draw, it makes
sense the way this decision was
arrived at."
Cynthia Wilbanks, vice presi-
dent for government relations at
the University, also said she was
pleased with Coleman's decision
to pick Hanlon for the position.
In an interview yesterday, Wil-
banks said she was very happy
with both the process of select-
ing the next provost and Hanlon's
selection.
"I'm thrilled about it," she said.
"I was very pleased that President
Coleman consulted broadly about
her choice."
"I have worked with Phil for a
long time and not only respect his
acumen when it comes to budget-
ary affairs of the University, but
his personal approach and style
which is both respectful and
engaging," she continued.
Wilbanks said she believes
Hanlon is uniquely qualified for
the position because of his current
position and extensive experience
handling many similar responsi-
bilities.
"He has a depth of knowledge
about the University's overall
budget and the challenges that
are associated with managing a
university budget of our scope
and scale that very few other
people really have," Wilbanks
said. "He has spent a lot of time
in his current position, and it's
part of his responsibilities to
be well informed, but I think
he has embraced the challenges
both related to constructing the
budget and then understanding
where the sensitivities and chal-
lenges are"
But Wilbanks indicated she
wasn't overly surprised by yester-
day's announcement that Hanlon
would succeed Sullivan.
"I know that Michigan has cho-
sen most of its provosts from with-
in," she said. "Certainly in the 40
years I've been in and around (the
University), the provost has been
just right for the time and they've
almost always come from our
own ranks, which is a wonderful
opportunity and an affirmation
of the strength of the people who

work here."

AUERBACH
From Page 1A
late leadsin games against beat-
able opponents.
Imagine, for a moment, if Michi-
gan had won just two or three of
those games. Let's pretend the Wol-
verines beat the Spartans last night
in front of an electric Crisler Arena
crowd. Instead of re-planning a
weekend vacation for the middle
of March, Michigan fans would be
analyzing whetherthey should have
rushed the court (again).
It's almost unbelievable: If
DeShawn Sims's layup at the
buzzer had hit a slightly different
spot on the rim, and a couple of
3-pointers fell against Wisconsin,
we'd be looking at this team an
entirely different way.
But the reality is, in each of the
games Michigan could have and
should have won, the Wolverines
found a way to lose. Great teams
don't do that. The Michigan States
of the world hit that mid-range
jumper instead of rimming out.
The Michigan States of the world
make the game's final defensive
stop to seal an important win.
"It hasn't been like the teams
we've played and lostleads to have
been bad," Sims said. "They've all

been NCAA teams, and they prove
it. They make NCAA plays when it's
the last few minutes of the game."
When it comes down to it, that
was the difference in last night's
game, and it's the difference
between an aspiring Tournament
team and a disappointed Michigan
squad.
I guess it's time to play the opti-
mist once more, and take a look at
the Wolverines' remaining games.
Michigan plays best at home, so
best-case scenario, it wins all five
home games. The Wolverines
could potentially even beat North-
western, Iowa and Minnesota on
the road. That's eight wins in ten
games. But none of those eight
would really be "signature wins."
Because of Michigan's almost-
wins (also known as "losses") in
statement games, the Wolverines
simply aren't in position to make
the tournament, barring a miracu-
lous Big Ten Tournament run.
It's a shame, honestly.
Michigan has the talent and
toughness to compete with tour-
nament teams. But because it can't
beat them, I guess we'll have to
settle for wondering what could
have been.

That money, he added, would
have to come from the city.
"I don't know why we'd want
to add to the (financial) burden,"
Rapundalo said.
The two proposals Rapundalo's
committee recommended each
feature a combined hotel and con-
ference center.
The first building proposal -
the @ Hotel and Retail Center
filed by Acquest Realty Advisors,
Inc. - would involve the con-
struction of a 190-room boutique-
style hotel with 5,340 square feet
of conference spaces.
The proposal said the hotel
would be geared toward middle-
to upper-class people between
ages 34 and 54. The hotel also
seeks to accommodate certain
members of the University com-
munity like alumni, sports fans
and prospective students. Acquest
Realty Advisors projected that the
working out its initial kinks last
semester, DPS spokeswoman
Diane Brown said it's still impor-
tant for students to register. DPS's
website advertised that students
would receive their stickers
within two weeks of registering,
but Brown said the turnaround

the library supports both propos-

it was a jump ball - Douglass would
lob the ball up near the basket and
hope that a Wolverine would tip it
in.
The referee blew the whistle,
and the ball was in play. The Spar-
tans switched on the screen for
Harris, which meant it was time
for the jump ball. Sims cut to the
basket. Douglass threw a perfect

pass. DeShawn Sims caught the ball

of focus and move on to the next
game."

probably ask-
ing yourself,
"What does that have to do with
this year's Wolverines?" - ateam
desperately trying to make the
Tournament for the 20th-straight
year?
Well, to be honest, it has every-
thing to do with this season's team
and a certain player's confidence.
You see, at the end of last sea-
son, a certain Wolverine finished
as a top-tO Hobey Baker Finalist
and grabbed AHCA/Reebok Divi-
sion I Ice Hockey All-American
First-Team honors. Not to men-
tion, he ended the year with a
team-high 24 goals, and was sec-
ond in scoring.
Only one year later, that par-
ticular Wolverine's time on the
ice has been a far cry from the
highlight reel performances he
delivered for the Michigan faith-
ful during the 2008- 2009 season.
By now, you've probably
guessed I'm referring to junior
center Louie Caporusso, a player
whose game still hasn't returned
from Bridgeport. Sure, the Wood-
bridge, Ont. native has tallied six
goals and 13 assists through 26
games, good for third on the team
in scoring so far. But against the
upper echelon of CCHA teams
- Miami, Michigan State, Fer-
ris State and Lake Superior State
- Caporusso has registered just
five points in eight games and has,
frankly, been a ghost on the ice all
season.
It took him five games to tally
his first point, and at times, Capo-
russo has looked more like he's on
a morning skate than in the thick
of a conference race.
Maybe I'm being too hard on a
player who showed me so much
last year, and this year, has shown
me close to nothing.
We're all - still wondering;
When i ast +e-'s Loienar--

russo going to crawl out of the
woodwork, throw this team on his
shoulders and catapult it into the
NCAA Tournament?
But looking closer into Capo-
russo's woes this year, there ma
be a few reasons for the drought.
Throughout the season, Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson has often
switched the lines on a week-to-
week basis, so the lack of consis-
tency with Caporusso's linemates
may have affected hi§ offensive
production.
Or it could be the departure of
former Wolverine Aaron Palushaj,
for the American Hockey League
after last season. Palushaj assisted
on a third of Caporusso's goals
and played considerable time
with him on the power play. But
Caporusso has, on multiple occa-
sions, played down the effect of
Palushaj's departure on his game.
It could simply be taking fewer
shots - he is fourth on the team
in shots, taking just 55 through
26 games or basically two shots a
game.
And for Caporusso, who's on
the power play and always skates
on one of the top two lines, that's
unacceptable. Maybe he has
changed his mindset, for what-
ever reason, to a pass-first-shoot-
second mentality. Any number
of different scenarios could be
attributed to Caporusso's offensive
demise. I, or anyone else for that
matter, haven't been able to pin-
point one specific area definitively.
While a player's worth can
surely be measured by more than
statistics alone - leadership in the
locker room, being a physical pres-
ence on the ice, finding a niche as
a role player - Caporusso was a
dominant force in college hockey
last year and a prolific goal scorer.
But at the end of the day, Capo-
russo needs to put goals in the
back of the net and resurrect his
sniper mentality if the Wolverines
are going to successfully make a
late-season push in the CCHA.
For now, the Louie of old has
long since vanished, and I don't
know when the resurrection is
going to take place.
All I can tell you is the No. 29
that lost to the Falcons in last
year's first round still hasn't

PERSONALSTATEMENT

GOING HOME
BY FAISAL MASOOD

Last year, while home in Pakistan
during winter break, I stopped
by my high school to visit old
teachers and friends. I talked with
some of the seniors there, just as they
were preparing to finish the semester,
almost ready to start a break of their
own. They were preoccupied with
many of the same concerns I'd had the
year before - examinations, college
applications, how they were going to
spend their winter vacations.
Seeing the familiar place, just as it
had been while I was a student there,
I. couldn't help but be overcome by a
pang of nostalgia. I thought about the
amazing moments I'd had, but, like
any time I think back to high school,
my thoughts drifted to the night of
December 27, 2007, when Benazir
Bhutto, the first female prime minis-
ter of Pakistan, was assassinated.
The walls of the gated community
in Karachi, where I grew up, stand
SECURITY, From Page 4B
Joking aside, Raiford says the job
has put a strain on some of his rela-
tionships.
"Your friends will call you when
they're doing something and you
find you can't go because you have
to get up at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. to go to
work."
Weekends, too, often pose a con-
flict for Raiford because he works
Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.
His days off are Tuesday and
Thursday. "It can be a little lonely
at times," Raiford admits. "That's
when things like Netflix, the Play-
station and the television come in
handy."
For Raiford - who considers him-
self a "relatively social person- the
most interesting part of his job is
the residents he encounters. Many
stop to chat with patrolling hous-
ing security officers but others are
reluctant, instantly tensing up at the
sight of a police officer.
"A sort of hesitant nervousness
comes about them because they
don't realize our job isn't to prevent
them from havingfun," Raiford says.
But he says he can understand
the feeling. "I have been the person
playing the music too loud at 3 a.m.,"

between the residents and the reality
that lingers outside the constructed
dividers. We desperately erect arti-
ficial barriers to give ourselves some
sense of security, hoping that any
mayhem will pass us by, leaving us
unscathed as pandemonium rages
outside. Having never really believed
in the concept of gated communities,
I've always frowned at the synthetic
sense of security that comes with
them. One may then excuse my slight
amusement when this sham belief
broke down the night Bhutto was
allegedly assassinated by militants,j
and the city of Karachi witnessed a
complete collapse of law and order
despite its constructed borders meant
to protect against just such an occur-
rence.
When the news of the assassi-
nation reached us, the community
administration decided to turn off
the streetlights, preferring to rely
he recalls.
Other times, he jokes, "I feel like
a Tyrannosaurus Rex. People think
if they keep quiet, I might not notice
them."
Raiford says he can relate to resi-
dents, especially freshmen adjusting
to life in college.
"While they are making this tran-
sition, I'm also in a similar phase,
making the step from college life
into the workforce," he says. "It
hasn't been that long since I was in
college and I know what it was like
back then."
But for Raiford, his role in the
community extends beyond the con-
ventional; description of a patrolling
officer.
"I try to make myself available
for the students," he explains. "On
occasion, some will stop by my office
and talk to me about life and how
they're coping with their newfound
stresses."
When the normally bustling cor-
ridors empty over school breaks,
Raiford admits the job gets a little
less interesting and the buildings
start to feel "creepy."
"But when there's nobody around
to hear you," he laughs, "you can
sing. out loud without worrying
about disturbing anyone." E

out in the wake of the assassination,
an odd thought crept into my head.
I couldn't help but worry about the
fast-approaching deadlines for college
applications.
The seemingly trivial concerns
about finalizing my application essays
made an awkward contrast with
thoughts of what the following weeks
would hold for my
country.
But that is how I,
and many others from

because you're all on third shift," he
- says. Third shift is another term for
the midnight shift, which, at Barry
Bagels, lasts from about 11 p.m. until
7 a.m.
As the early morning wears on,
more of the deliveries are collected in
person, and Holmes has a short chat
with each recipient. The most person-
al interaction occurs at Washtenaw
Dairy.
"The Washtenaw Dairy is sort of a
i throwback store. It's my favorite place
to deliver," he says.
The sales manager there, Dave Hal-
man, used to be a police officer and
sympathizes with Holmes and other
midnight shift workers because, Hal-
man says, he has had many midnight

While I was back home last year,
I decided to meet with the school
librarian, Mr. Azeem. After the initial
pleasantries, our conversation quickly
turned toward the political situation,
as it so often does in Pakistan. When
our bitter rants were finished, Mr.
Azeem sighed and simply said, "Life
goes on."
This is not an attempt to put on
a sheepish grin and downplay the
troubles of Pakistan when the head-
lines sauntering across the news
ticker mention a bomb that went off
two miles from your house, or when
you've had one of your cars stolen and
burned during political violence.
This is simply an attempt to show
that reality for most of us in Pakistan
is not the chaos that surrounds brief
moments of normalcy, but rather,
the normalcy that encircles sporadic
tumult. If violence has forced its way
into our lives over the past few years
at the behest of a tiny minority stub-
born in its desire to make a statement
of hate and bigotry, then the hundreds
of millions who go about their daily
lives are also making a statement -
one of resilience and determination in
the face of hardship. U

Though Holmes' daily schedule
is busy and serves as an obstacle to a
normal social life and sleep cycle, he
says he finds companionship with
other third shift workers. His buddies
at the store, various delivery recipi-
ents and late night radio keep him
motivated, but it's the routine that has

Hey. This is Sam Wolson from
The MichiganDaily.
Hello.
Who'sthis?
Karlee [last name removed].
Is that, like, Scottish?
It's Polish.
What's the difference?
Well, Polish people are from Poland
and Scottish people are from Scotland.
Oh, OK. I guess that makes sense. So
what areyou studyinghere?
Sports Management.
So, you're looking to do, I assume,
sports?
Potentially. Yeah.
Anyparticular sports interestyou?
I've always been a big hockey fan, and I
played basketball.
Areyou awomen'sbasketballfan?
No, I'd much rather watch men's 'cause
there's much more aggression.
Oh, so you just like the aggression
in basketball? Why don't you just
watch wrestling? If wrestling were
put ontotelevisionwouldyouwatch
it?
No.

For the aggression?
No.
Oh, OK. So how did you get into
sports inthefirstplace?
I started dance when I was three,
which led to soccer.
[Laughs] Dance led to soccer?
Yeah, no correlation, but it happened.
But I hatedsoccer. As a kid, I never saw
the purpose of running back and forth
chasing a ball. And the score of 2to1 to
win a game...
I thought you said you liked hockey
though.
I do. But you can hit people in hockey.
So it comes back to the aggression
thing. I gotcha.
[Laughs]
So dance led to soccer, which then
lednto...
A discontinuation of soccer because I
hated it. Then I started playing T-ball
when I was five and my dad coached
me up until high school softball. I was
the only girl on the team for T-ball, so I
loved it. And then basketball, I started
playing in third grade. And I actually
became relatively good.

Would you consider yourself a tom-
boy?
Um,no.
No? Then how would you define
tomboy?
[Laughs] Uh, I mean. [To roommates:]
Shut up.
Is this sensitive to you?
No, no. My roommates are making fun
of me because they think I've made a
new friend. I would consider a tomboy
someone who doesn't care much about
how they present themselves, or ...
I've always had more guy friends than
girl friends, but a tomboy is a girl that
doesn't really associate with girls at all.
So a tomboy is a girl who doesn't
associate withgirls?
Yeah.
But you do hang out with a lot of
guys andlike sports alot?
Yeah. I definitely have many more guy
friends than female friends.
OK.Areyou partofany clubs?
Uh, I was in Maize Rage buttthen I...
Whatis that? What's Maize Rage?
It's the basketball student section.
Oh, so with the sports again. Don't

you like kittens or anything?
Do I like kittens?
What's the first thing you look at
besides Facebook and Gmail when
yougo onthe Internetatnight?
[Laughs] Um, pretty much those are
the two, and then if I get really bored I
go to Texts From Last Night.
[Laughs] Have you ever been a con-
tributor?
Actually yeah.
What did you contribute? If you
don't mind me asking.
Um. [Long silence]. It involved some-
one wakingup to find a condom in their
bed and wanting an explanation.
That someone wasn'tyou,was it?
It was actually a friend, and I swear to
you it was ajoke. We putitinherbed to
freak her out.
Oh, so this girl woke up and found
a condom in her bed and was, like,
'what happened? Where is this
from?'
Yeah.
OK. That's funny.

nspired by my roommate who,
a few years ago, implemented
something her and her boyfriend
called "Niceness Movement '08"
to curb the pattern of involun-

toward each other, I decided to
undertake a movement of my own.

Feeling I was more judgmental
than most of my peers, I pitched
a story to my editor about a self-
imposed "week of niceness" dur-
ing which I would wholly refrain
from any sort of meanness, spite or
hatred.
Initially, my editor wanted me to
immediately apologize to everyone
I had a negative thought about in
an attempt to remedy the situation.
But after realizing that route might

cause more harm than good (read:
black eyes and broken limbs), we
settled on the following guidelines:
Each time I did, said or thought
something unpleasant, whatever it
may be, I'd have to counter it with
an equal, yet opposite reaction. I
would also go out of my way to be
kind, regardless of who the recipi-
ent was.
Unsure how to kick off my week
of niceness, I baked cookies for my
friends and co-workers. And while
the cookies were much appreciated
- and delicious - I realized that
though the treats were palate pleas-
ing, my action was entirely self-
ish. I had made the cookies. I had
passed them around. I was receiv-
ing the compliments. I felt great
about myself, but what was I really
accomplishing for others?
With my first attempt an epic
failure, I quickly changed gears.
I decided the week wouldn't be so
much about being excessively nice
to others, but rather seeing what
kind of effect the no-meanness
mantra would have on me.

Ricco says he has made some strong
friendships while working the mid-
night shift. Because there are fewer
people he's been able to establish
closer bonds. The midnight shift also
frees up time during his day to do
things he normally wouldn't be able
to. "I get a lot of time during the day
to do what I want to do. I get to see
my wife more than if I worked regular
hours," he says.
On a typical workday, Ricco drives
the 30 minutes from his home to
"base," the DPS headquarters on
Kipke Drive. Once at the base, Ricco
changes into his uniform and gets
briefed by the midnight shift super-
visor. Ricco then takes his 50-minute
cumulative wellness break to work
out at the gym. Officers on midnight
duty can opt for one 50-minute cumu-
lative wellness break or two 15-min-
ute breaks and one 20-minute break.
"I do simple things, like running

downs.
"The first few hours are usually
easier and bearable," Ricco says. But,
he continues, it can be hard sometime
after 3 a.m., which the officers call the
"bewitching hour." "If we're not driv-
ing around, it will be really easy to
nod off. It's known as the

"Are they bad people? No. Are they

He urged students to realize that
DPS is a necessary evil because, he
says, when intoxicated, some students
are at risk of endangering themselves
and those around them.
"I wish students could see that we
don't wander around hoping to catch
every student for any silly action. It's
all under an officer's discretion and if
I see something that could potentially
be dangerous, my conscience will not
allow me to simply drive past it."
Despite the fact that Ricco enjoys
most parts of his job, there is one
thing that gets to him - the changing
sleeping patterns. "On my off days,
I have to switch to real people time
and that is sometimes tiring." But
Ricco says he can see himself con-

The Westgate Shopping Center, about 3
miles west of the University's Central Cam-
pus, looks dead at 11 p.m. The parking lot is
void of cars and eerily quiet. The storefronts
of T.J. Maxx, the public library and Nicola's
books are dark, empty and locked. Another
tenant, Barry Bagels, is no exception. Inside
the unlit bagel store sits a few rows of tidy
tables and chairs and a metal rack neatly
stocked with bags of chips. The neon sign on
the front window is no longer glowing - the

At first glance, the darkness of the early
morning hour hides any sign of life. But
inside, three employees are hard at work.
Washtenaw Community College student
Dameon Holmes, a fulltime bagel delivery man
for Barry Bagels - a retail and wholesale bagel
store with locations in Ann Arbor and Ohio -
is sorting bagels for delivery with Lamar Hop-
kins, a student at Concordia University, and
Jeff Schwerin, the wholesale manager who
has worked at Barry Bagels for 17 years.
The three have a long night ahead of them -
they work from 11 p.m. until 7 a.m., delivering
nearly 7,000 bagels throughout Ann Arbor and
the surroundingcommunities.
They arrive at the store just as the baking
crew finishes its
nightly production
of 546 dozen bagels.

to be separated into

tion.

ing process takes

After Holmes bags the bagels for his
25-stop delivery route, he loads them into the
back of one of the three white vans parked
out back and begins his two and a half hour
expedition. Holmes delivers bagels to all
Ann Arbor locations - University buildings,
Alpha Chi Omega sorority, the three down-
town Espresso Royale locations and. other
local cafes. The two others deliver outside the
downtown Ann Arbor area.
First stop: the University of Michigan Com-
prehensive Cancer Center. Holmes pulls into
the circle drive in front of the hospital, turns
his hazard lights on and grabs four bags from
the trunk. He leaves the van running and hur-
ries through the glass front doors.
After scanning an ID card on a digital read-
er, Holmes turns a few corners and hops on an
elevator. Exiting into a waiting room, Holmes
rounds a few more corners and leaves the bags
on a long, empty counter.
"The hospital is so quiet at three or four
in the morning," Holmes says. "You're half
awake and you think you're seeing things. You
just try to get in and out."
Though Holmes says the hospital is by far
his most unpleasant stop, he considers many
of the others on his route to be just as isolat-
ing because they require him to venture into
some of the most remote areas of residence
hall basements.
Holmes tries to maintain an efficient sched-
ule in an attempt to shorten his nights and
avoid long stretches in the empty basements.
"I have a routine where I get in at a certain
time and out at a certain time," he says. "You
get on a certain schedule."

At four in the morning in
Ann Arbor, after the bars
have all shut their doors
and dorm room lights go
off one by one, it's easy to
I assume that all have settled
down for the night.
But amid the darkness, a few
solitary lights remain: The flo-
rescent lamps of a third floor office
in the Michigan Union; the headlights
of a white commercial van driving down
Washtenaw Avenue, making its way toward
the Medical Campus; the pilot light of a large
industrial stove in the kitchen of the Hill Dining
Center; one flashlight finding its way through the
dark basement of the South Quad Residence Hall dur-
ing a security check; another one identifying the face of
a worried driver pulled to the side of the road.
These are the lights of Ann Arbor's 4 a.m. workforce -
the graveyard shift, the midnight mavens. Though thei:
efforts often go unnoticed, they're the ones who keel
campus running when no one else is looking.
These are their stories - the backwards sleep
cycle, the compromised social life, the sacrifices
made to work a second job to pay one's way
through school. This is the life of the 4 am.
workforce.

.ateteria Look
By ADDIE SHRODES
Cafeteria workers at the Hill Dining Center
rise hours before the sun on a recent January
morning to prepare breakfast for students on
the Hill. The cafeteria is quiet and dark at 5:30
a.m., but cooks arrive just after 6 a.m. to begin
unloading carts of bulk supplies like muffin
batter and raw bacon from the stock room
into the industrial kitchen.
Breakfast service starts at 7:30 a.m. on
weekdays, which leaves the cooks less than
two hours to prepare the 15-item menu for the
hundreds of students who will file through
the lines over the course of three hours.
Breakfast ends at -10:30 a.m., and when it's
over the cooks at Hill will have fed anywhere
from'600 to 800 people.
The head breakfast cook at Hill this morn-
ing is Keyshia Brown, who normally works
the lunch shift from 9 a.m. to 6:30 pin. Today,
however, she's filling in for the regular break-
fast cook. Brown actually prefers the earlier
hours because, she says, "you get it over and
done with."
The 28-year-old Brown wakes up at 4:30
a.m. to get from her home in Ypsilanti to the
dining center by 6 a.m. for the morningshift.
Brown transferred from the Markley Dining
Hall to Hill when it opened in 2008 because
the hours were earlier. At Markley, Brown
worked the 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. shift, which ate
up most of her day. But since she now finishes
work earlier in the day, Brown says she's able

Housing
Security
By EMAD ANSARI
For Jeremy Raiford, the drive
home to Canton from Ann Arbor,

where he works as a Housing
Security officer in the University
residence halls, is often bother-
some. The sun shining in his eyes
is an unwelcome sight at seven in
the morning. It's easy to despise
the sun, he says, when you work
during the night.
"You feel kind of like a vam-
pire," Raiford jokes. "It's natural
for your body to want to stay up

when there's sunlight stream-
ing through the windows, so you
have to take extra measures to
block out the sunlight."
A graduate of Grand Valley
State University with a major
in criminal justice, Raiford, 25,
joined University Housing Secu-
rity in the spring of 2008. Hav-
ing initially aspired to become a
lawyer, Raiford soon realized he
wanted to work in the field rath-
er than analyze criminal activity
from behind a desk.
Most nights, Raiford patrols
the residence hall he's been
assigned - making sure the
building is secure and respond-
ing to emergencies on residen-
tial floors. However, some nights
Raiford works Central Patrol,
providing backup to other offi-
cers in the field.
He claims he can usually tell
how busy the night is going to
be based on the general mood of
the students he sees during his
patrols.
"If people are dressed to go
out," he says, "it can indicate you
might get a few calls later in the
night."

Weaving a path through the
dingy, maze-like basements of
residence halls has become sec-
ond nature to Raiford - especial-
ly in the South Quad residence
hall, where he first received
training.
"After a while," he explains,
"you can move through these
places in the dark, even without
a flashlight."
There are a few faces among
the maintenance and kitchen
staffs he has come to recognize.
"They become part of the scen-
ery," he says.
While the initial adjustment to
the unusual schedule that accom-
panies night shifts is difficult,
Raiford says the body self-cor-
rects after a while. Though some-
times, he admits, the strange
sleep pattern can create some
difficult dilemmas.
"You have to decide between
sleep and watching football,"
Raiford, a lifelong Detroit Lions
fan, says with a laugh. "You also
get used to really weird food
choices, like eating cereal with
spaghetti or pizza for breakfast."

DPS Officer
By SUTHA KANAGASINGAM
Sometime after 2 a.m. on Fri-
day night, when you think no one
is looking, you roll through a stop
sign at a seemingly abandoned
intersection. Seconds later, the
familiar blue and red lights flash
in your car's rear-view mirror and
you grudgingly pull over to the
side of the road.
A Department of Public Safety
officer will then walk up to your
window, shine a flashlight in your
face and determine whether you
can get by with just a warning, or
if you'll have to pay the $130 fine.
DPS Officer Anthony Ricco,

who has worked with the depart-
ment for seven years - six of them
on the midnight shift - could very
well be that person.
Midnight shifts at DPS are
10-hours long - from 10 p.m. to
8 a.m. every day. Several supervi-
sors and officers, like Ricco, are
on duty during this time, though
Ricco could not exactly say how
many because DPS doesn't want
the public to know the number of
officers working at night.
DPS officers bid for shifts every
four months, and the shifts are
then assigned based on seniority.
Surprisingly, some actually prefer
the late hours.
"I like working at night," Ricco
says. "So I usually choose mid-
night shifts."

Union
Janitor
By SAM WAINWRIGHT
While you're packing up your
bag at the Grad or trekking home
from the UGLi late at night, most of
the University's custodians are just
starting their workday. With shifts
ranging anywhere from the 7 p.m.
to 3:30 a.m. shift at the Michigan
Union, to the 4 a.m. to noon shift at
the Duderstadt Center, the Univer-
sity's custodial staff are hard at work
while the rest of us are sleeping - or
drinking.
And the drinking is actually what
causes much of the mess, according
to University custodian Dave Steiner,
who says students often stumble into
unlocked campus buildings like the
Union and use them as "pit-stops"
on their way home from the bars or
house parties.
"The bathrooms (in the Union)
are hideous," Steiner says of the
resulting mess. "Women are worse

tan menjust so people know.
For Pete Copp, the University's
custodial supervisor, a normal day
will start with his alarm ringing at
around 2 p.m.,justin time to catch his
kids as they return home fromschool.
"It's difficult for me because I
have two kids (and they play) foot-
ball, soccer, all the sports," Copp said
of trying to balance being a father
and working a midnight shift. "But
luckily for me, I'm off on the week-
ends. Some of the other guys that
work weekends, it's a little difficult."
Starting his shift at the Union
at 7 p.m., Copp typically grabs his
"breakfast" right around when most
people are sitting down for dinner.
The custodians take a "lunch" break
anytime between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.,
and then eat dinner when they get
home, most nights after 4 a.m.

Though the work can oftenbe iso-
lating and dull, many Union custodi-
ans say they've seen their fair share
of bizarre encounters. Just over two
weeks ago, they caught a man sleep-
ing in the Union Ballroom with a
few hundred feet of curtains he

nad puiied irom the waiis wrapped
around his body. However, many
of the custodians say the Michigan
League seems to be the epicenter of
late night weirdness.
According to Custodian Arron
Stroud, the League has seen every-
thing from fully-equipped midnight
baseball games in the ballroom to
bubble baths in the fountain to wild-
life in the hallways.
"Weheard footsteps," Stroud says.

"Andtnere was no one in tne naiiway
except for us. So we went out into the
hallway and there was a deer just
walking through the hall on the sec-
ond floor."
But it's not just'the students who
keep the custodians busy. Steiner
says the yearly Anesthesiology party
has the reputation of being a "rager,"
resulting in a lot of cleanup for him
and his fellow custodians.
