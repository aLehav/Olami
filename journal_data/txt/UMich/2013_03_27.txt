Daily StaffReporter
Rackham Student Govern-
ment elections began Wednes-
day at 12:01 a.m., and two
Rackham student tickets are
squaring off for the presidency
and vice presidency.
RSG Treasurer Phil Sac-
cone and Vice President Kaitlin
Flynn have the upperhand in
RSG experience as they chal-
lenge RSG board member Ryan
Roberts and Dave Marvin, who
is not currently affiliated with
RSG.
Roberts was previously the
president of the University of
Michigan Engineering Coun-
cil, the student government of
the College of Engineering, and
Marvin was formerly a steward
with the Graduate Employees'
Organization. Marvin is cur-

rently a leader of the movement
urging the University to divest
all investments from fossil fuel
industries.
Both groups expressed cau-
tion over pursuing graduate
student secession from Central
Student Government, an idea
that was proposed in the fall. In
the fall RSGelections, 69 percent
of the 9.5 percent of Rackham
students who voted supported
pursuing secession.
While not taking a hard
stance, Saccone said that seces-
sion is an option that should
be delved into further. Still, he
stressed that RSG should use the
current channels to work with
CSG.
"It's important that we work
on the levels that are now avail-
able with us with CSG, not just
with the executives, but also
with the reps that serve their
graduate student body on CSG,"
he said.
Flynn noted that she has had

HIGHER EDUCATION
Fla. proposal for
STEM degrees
irks Coleman

Experts disagree on
impact of lowering
tuition for science
and math majors
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Artists, philosophers and his-
torians might have reason to be
wary of a Florida initiative that is
garnering the attention of higher
education officials across Michi-
gan.
A higher education reform
task force commissioned by Flor-
ida Gov. Rick Scott is suggesting
lower college tuition for "high-
demand" degrees, many of which
involve the Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math fields.
Scott has identified science and
technology as the future of Flor-
ida's economy and, consequently,
two fields in which students can
readily find jobs.
In a 2011 interview with the
Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Scott
seemed to doubt the need for
more liberal arts majors.

"Is it a vital interest of the
state to have more anthropolo-
gists? I don'tthinkso," Scottsaid.
The initiative set off a national
dialogue about the role of public
higher education institutions,
and, more pointedly, whether
or not some degrees are bet-
ter investments for taxpayers.
In Texas, Governor Rick Perry
has mulled similar proposals to
lower fees for STEM degrees in
order to encourage students to
pursue those fields instead of lib-
eral arts.
In February, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman said the
initiative discredits the worth
that all degrees promise. She
noted that a finance student, for
instance, could participate in a
classics program that would pro-
vide skills that student could use
in his future career.
"What the humanities do
so well is really help students
acquire a discipline of inquiry
and problem solving," Coleman
said. "(I dislike) the notion that
some degrees are less valuable
than others."
No similar measures have

government in order to improve

In contrast, Public Policy
senior Alexander Lane, forUM's
communication director, said his
party's strategy involved seeking
candidates from the general stu-
dent body.
"Weweretheonly partythathad

how we're different."
Lane admitted that forUM's

been proposed in Michigan, and
many within the state's Republi-
can party sayit's unlikelyto occur
in Michigan.
State Rep. Al Pscholka (R-Ste-
vensville), chairman of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on
Higher Education, said scholar-
ships and giving younger students
experience in STEM fields would
produce better science graduates.
"How do we teach science and
math at lower levels that makes it
moreexcitingforchildren?" Pschol-
ka said. "That's maybe the root
causeofthisissue ratherthansubsi-
dizingtuition atthe lateryears."
The Florida proposal does not
specify which majors would qual-
ify for low tuition. Rather, it iden-
tifies STEM, health professions,
education specialties in math and
science, "globalization" and pub-
lit safety services as key areas of
economic development.
This initiative from the Repub-
lican governor is exemplary of his
recent focus on energizing Flori-
da's economy. In his State of the
State Address earlier this month,
Scott's first discussion point was
education.
"The workers of tomorrow are
inFlorida classrooms today," Scott
said inthe address. "I believe Flor-
ida will be the number one place
in the world for job creation (and)
the number one place in the world
to get agreat education."
The program builds upon
Scott's earlier proposal that the
state's 28 community colleges
offer degrees for $10,000, which
was similarly a 2011 move in
Texas by Gov. Rick Perry.
Michael Van Beek, director of
education policy at the Mackinac
Center for Public Policy, a conser-
vative-leaning think tank based
in Midland, Mich., said similar
proposals are unlikely to occur
in Michigan because there is no
unified state university system.
He added that one problem with
the initiative is the potential for
students to use the lower tuition
incentive to pursue a degree that
does not fit them.
School of Education Prof.
Lisa Lattuca, who specializes in
researching problems of higher
education in engineering, coun-
tered that the efforts could make
certain fields more accessible.
The historical underrepresenta-
tion of women and minorities in

STEM fields, she said, is alimiting
factor in its growth.
"If (the efforts) get students to
a degree that will get their foot
in the workforce, then that's not
such a bad thing," Lattuca said.
"It's possible that some students
might study something that their
hearts are not in, but I don't think
that's much different than what
goes on now."
Scott emphasized in the 2011
interview that taxpayers are
funding higher education, so they
should expect a return on their
investments by having work-
force-ready graduates.
However, Economics Prof.
Charles Brown said the money
invested in all types of educa-
tion would have a small effect on
Florida's economy. Notably, some
grads educated by the Florida sys-
tem may take their tech savvy to
out-of-state companies.
Brown added that job prediction
is difficult, and the proposal rests
on the assumption that politicians
can determine growing fields.
"If you look at currently 'hot'
jobs and asked whether anyone
knew they would be 'hot' 15 years
ago, I think in many cases the
answer is clearly 'no,' " Brown
said. "The idea is not to pick hot
fields; it's to train people so they
can adapt to a very hard-to-pre-
dict future. I wish I had good evi-
dence on whether STEM training
makes people more adaptable."

than those of other parties, he said
the party would run members of
the University's chapters of both
the College Republicans and Col-
lege Democrats as candidates.
Lane said though students
would have a tendency to vote
for the candidates whose names
were more largely recognized on
campus, he hopes that the candi-
dates elected would be the ones
with the greatest vision for the
progression of the University, not
recognition.
"We think we have the better
ideas, but there are alot of decent
candidates running for other par-
ties too," Lane said. "We think
we've worked harder on our ideas,
and we think that they are more
comprehensive."

momentUM will be running
only one LSA representative in
this election cycle.
"Since this is our first year,
we've decided to start off small
and work our way up," explained
Riethmiller, the party's chair.
"I think we are a little bit more
accessible, and our goals and our
platforms goes more along with
everyone's needs."
Though she admires the other
parties' platforms, Reithmiller
said momentUM's platforms will
resonate more with the student
body and will be more applicable
to a broader spectrum of Univer-
sity students.
"We have not met a single
LSA student who does not need
more printing," Reithmiller said

of their platform to increase the
number of allocated printing
pages for LSA students.
She said forUM's idea to have
a student representative on the
Board of Regents would be great
but logistically impossible.
Although Ruza voiced her sup-
port for the youMICH candidates
and praised their successes as stu-
dent leaders, she said she hopes
that students will rank and vote
for the candidate that they feel
best supports their needs.
"I really believe that students
should take a moment and check
out each student's platform,"
Ruza said. "I think they should
vote on ideas, and they should
vote on who they think is goingto
represent them best."

is collegiate debate.
THE REWARD

Even though it dates back
to 1890, the University Debate
Team has never won a national
championship. The competi-
tors, the coaches and Univer-
sity administrators want this
to change. Their goal is for one
of the University's three debate
pairs to win the 67th National
Debate Tournament being held
at Weber State University in
Ogden, Utah the weekend of
March 30.
After 123 years, the 2013
tournament may finally be
the team's chance to win it all.
The team as a whole is ranked
second in the latest national
debate tournament varsity
rankings and has two pairings
in the top 16. The University
is one of six colleges to have
three pairs go to the national
tournament.
Aaron Kal, director of the
University's debate team, said
winning the national champion-
ship is the "end goal" everyyear.
"We want nothing more than
to be able to say that we were
the first debate team to win the
national championship for the
University of Michigan," Kall
said.
The debate team was a
student club from the mid-
1980s until 2002 when it was
brought under University Stu-
dent Affairs. Since then it has
expanded both in size and
achievement. It now has about
24 students and three full-time
coaches. The team is entirely
self-funded through a summer
high-school debate camp and
alumni donations.
Laura Blake Jones, the Uni-
versity's associate vice presi-
dent for student affairs and
dean of students, believes the
team will soon achieve their
goal.
"In March, while we might
be cheering our basketball
team in terms of a national
competition, we could also be
cheering the debate team as
they look at perhaps winning a
national championship," Jones
said. "I can feel it. If it's not
this year it will be sometime
soon; we certainly got the tal-
ent on the team, and our time
is coming."
Unlike the clearly defined
rules of basketball, collegiate
debate is filled with more tradi-
tions and customs than inscribed
regulations.
THE RULES
Collegiate debates are fought
between four people - two per
team from each school - and last
up to two hours. Each person is
given nine minutes for a "con-
structive" speech, three minutes
for the competing team's ques-
tions and six minutes for a rebut-
tal speech. Teams are also given
a short amount of "prep time,"
during which both teams are
allowed to pause the debate in
order to prepare.
For each school year, a large
overarching resolution about
federalgovernmentpolicyis cho-
sen to be the subject of the year's
debates. For the 2012 to 2013
school year, students are debat-
ing on whether or not the federal
government should encourage

various types of energy produc-
tion.
The topic of specific debates,
however, is determined com-
pletely by the team going first.
They usually present an argu-
ment - an "affirmative" in
debate lingo - on a specific

aspect of the broad resolution.
For example, this year's teams
have called for more offshore
drilling on the East Coast or
subsidies favoring a specific
type of nuclear energy. Regard-
less of the first team's topic,
the opposing team must debate
against it.
Choosing the topic for each
debate is one the most impor-
tant strategic decision of a
debate pair. Some pairs use the
same affirmative for the entire
competitive season while oth-
ers change it up every tour-
nament or even every debate.
Topics are decided depending
on the opponents' strengths,
new original research or even
the judge's supposed prefer-
ence.
The team going first generally
informs their opponents about
the debate topic up to an hour
before it, leaving just enough
time to quickly go over already
collected research. This is not a
rule, and sometimes - especially
in the case of a newly created
topic - teams may not inform
the competition until the debate
starts.
Except for the strict time
limits, there are few other
formal rules, Kevin Hirn,
LSA junior and debate team
member said. During a debate

or physically shared between
team members. Instead, it
is stored in large Microsoft
Word files that are broken
down by topic and is viewed
and edited by all the team
members.
With a simple mouse click,
evidence collected by the Uni-
versity's entire team can now
be discovered and used quick-
ly during debates.
Before a section of a debate
starts, USB flash drives with
the evidence to be used in
that section are exchanged
between teams. Recently,
teams, including the Universi-
ty's, have started uploading all
evidence used to a debate web-
site at the end of tournaments.
The vast majority of evidence
collected is never used during
an actual debate. Kell said the
University uploads its research
because it creates higher-
quality debates and helps new
programs 'catch up' with the
better ones.
Because of the amount of
research in today's debates,
competitors have sped up
their rate of discourse, Uni-
versity debate alum Neil Wolf
said.

tives in the past, but that is
by no means any indication
of frosty relations with the
assembly.
Roberts took an even softer
approach to secession, saying an
"intersection of our interests"
exists between RSG and CSG he
has been pleased with how the
current administrations have
interacted.
"If the next (CSG) adminis-
tration is as amenable to coop-
eration and resolution as the
current administration is, I
don't think it's going to be an
issue beyond our second week
in office," he said.
Marvin said secession isn't
an interest, but "it's not off the
table entirely."
Both tickets said they sup-
port improving the career
services provided to graduate
students and better commu-
nication of the services cur-
rently provided. Both tickets
also noted the influence of
RSG with administrators, cit-
ing the recent change in Rack-
ham's GPA scale from 9.0 to 4.0
- which takes effect fall 2013
- as an example of an idea that
originated within RSG and
became a reality.
Flynn said if were Sac-
cone and she to be elected,
the Graduate Student Bill of
Rights and Responsibilities -
a project that has been years
in the making - would come
to fruition.
"That's a document that has
been in the nascent stages and
then growing ever since Ijoined
the board," Flynn said.
While there is currently
an all-encompassing Student
Bill of Rights and Respon-
sibilities, Flynn said there
are circumstances unique to
graduate students that should
be codified. She said the bill
is modeled after similar docu-
ments at other Big 10 univer-
sities.
"In it we afford such rights as
the right to professional devel-
opment tools, or the right to
appropriate training if you're
going to be giving a class," she
said, adding that the bill is close
to being presented to adminis-
trators.
Roberts and Marvin's cam-
paign for the executive arm of
RSG also introduces sustain-
ability, a topic hat has not been
highly stressed before by the
body.
While the University has
made promises about reduc-
ing greenhouse gasses, Mar-
vin said it could do much more
and RSG leaders can advocate
for that. Roberts said he also
wants to change the atmo-
sphere within RSG and create
new connections with seg-
ments of the Rackham popula-
tion.
"There's a culture to student
government," Roberts said. "If
there's an administration that's

running for three years solid,
it's going to have a certain set
of connections that are made
available."
Robert said there is nothing
wrong with the same adminis-
tration consistently in power,
but "there must be competition"
to keep the election honest and
keeps students active. Marvin
agreed.
"What student, or graduate
student especially, is going to
log in to vote when they know
the outcome ahead of time?"
Marvin said.
Roberts said that collabora-
tion among student govern-
ments on projects such as town
halls or social events would be
a goal of his administration.
He also added that RSG needs
to do a better job reaching out
to its own students, noting that
it has held public hearings this
semester with one speaker at
each hearing.
Marvin also contended that
Saccone and Flynn's history in
RSG doesn't translate to more
experience in running a student
government.
"Yes, (Saccone and Flynn)
have that experience, but I
think our dynamic is more fit for
running a student government,"
Marvin said. "Ryan has tremen-
dous experience both at RSG as
well as the Engineering Council
He knows how these govern-
ments run."
Having served this past year
as president, Flynn said her
decision to run again for vice
president instead of opting
for the presidency was made
with time in mind. She didn't
feel she would be able to dedi-
cate the necessary time while
accomplishing her duties as a
student.
RSG president Michael Ben-
son - now completing his third
consecutive term - is not run-
ning for president, but he said
whoever wins needs to be aware
of the wide diversity of stu-
dents in the Rackham Graduate
School.
Benson said RSG has done
wellin connectingwithstudents
over the past year, but "there's
always room for improvement."
He also noted that he hopes to
see the push for not just seces-
sion, but also for greater repre-
sentation of graduate students
to continue.
"The underlying point is no
matter how it happens," he said.
"I want to see better represen-
tation for graduate students and
I would like to see increased
financial control for graduate
and professional students of
their fees."
Benson, however, has shied
away from using the word
"secession," saying that it isn't
the only option for graduate
students.
"'Secession' carries some-
thing of a negative con-
notation," he said. "When
people hear secession they
think back to the Civil War,
and you know that wasn't a
Great time."

Take the 'U' out of fossl fuel
New CSG leadership must focus on sustainability
Last Tuesday, the Central Student Government voted to reject
a petition urging the University to reform its current sub-
stantial investments in the fossil fuel industry. Proposed by
the Divest and Invest campaign, a coalition of students, faculty and
community members, the petition called on University administra-
tion to disclose its investments in fossil fuel industries and commit
to divesting the estimated $900 million the University presently
holds in the industry. As a national leader in research and educa-
tion that promotes sustainability, the University has a demonstrated
obligation to invest in industries that align with the goals it espous-
es. When the new CSG executives take office, a renewed focus on
sustainability must become a critical piece of the administration's

No more dining hell

T he University is home to
nine dining halls, seven
residence hall cafes and
countless other
University-oper-
ated eateries.
Eating options
for students are
innumerable,
and freshmen
are even known
to gain the infa-
mous "freshman HEMA
15" from the KARUNA-
plethora of food KARAM
available.
But quantity
and quality don't seem to go hand
in hand with University Dining. In
fact, it's not even a big stretch to say
they're inversely related.
Last week I bit into one of South
Quad dining hall's breakfast egg-
and-cheese croissants and found a
whole uncooked egg yolk spilling out
of the center onto my plate. Abso-
lutelyhorrified, I wrote a Facebook
status later that day sharing this
anecdote. The response was over-
whelming.
My uncooked egg sandwich
was only one of several atrocities
supposedly found in the dining
halls. Other students encountered
strands of hair in their "fresh" sal-
ads or dirty utensils that should've
been thoroughly washed. Nearly
every studentI told about my raw
egg had an equally - if not more -
disgusting experience to relate. On
top of that, several students found
that their concerns over allergies
or dietary restrictions largely fell
on deaf ears among the residence
hall staff. When I asked them why
none of these matters had been
pursued, something along the lines
of "no one cares" was the general

response.
I don't niean to go all Upton
Sinclair on the dining halls. To be
fair, the options available are still
sufficient for many students. As
a vegetarian, I've never found it
particularly difficult to geta meal
in dining rooms, even if my narrow
choices have become monotonous
over time. Horror stories of unsafe
food or utensils are the exceptions,
not the norm. There are plenty of
diningstaff members who are pas-
sionate about accommodating for
allergies and restrictions, and get-
ting students the best, safest food
possible.
So why does there continue to be a
gap between what students want and
what they actually receive?
Perhaps part of the issue lies
within the organizational struc-
ture of the dining halls. Sumana
Palle, a sophomore and former
North Quad Residence Hall dining
hall employee, reports having wit-
nessed an obvious lack of sensitiv-
ity among staff for students with
food allergies. "As soon as someone
who was complaining walked
away, the supervisor would turn
to me and roll his eyes, which was
very disheartening," she told me.
Like Palle, many of the employees
are students themselves and likely
aren't particularly passionate about
improving the dining experience.
Those who actually care, such as
the managers, tend to be behind
the scenes and less frequently
directly encounter issues that stu-
dents face.
Over the past several years, there
have been pushes for more health-
ful and sustainable food options in
the dininghalls fromboth students
and administrators. While these are
important improvements, the pri-

mary concern should be making food
safer to eat.
Part of the solution, however,
lies in our hands, too. Leave it to
our generation to Facebook and
tweet about dining hall atrocities
instead of actually sending in a
complaint to someone who might
be able to help - I've since sent
in a formal complaint of my own,
though I haven't heard back yet.
The dining halls are always asking
for feedback, so if you want to see a
difference, fill out a comment form
or do it online. If the food or uten-
sils you're using make you uncom-
fortable in any way, tell someone
who works there instead of just
complaining about it on Facebook.
Though human nature is such that
we often only remember our worst
experiences, employees who genu-
inely care do exist, and it is pos-
sible you will encounter someone
who wants to hear your complaints
and make your dining experience
better.
I don't want to
find raw eggs in
my meals.
I don't want to find any more raw
eggs, strands of hair or bits of old
food in the meals I'm served in the
dining halls. But if we don't start
talking about it, who will? It's time
we take dining back into our own
hands and'start workingto improve
the food we're served on campus.

platform.
From creating the Program in the Environ-
ment major a decade ago to the Planet Blue
campaign, sustainability on campus exists in
many forms. In September 2011, University
President Mary Sue Coleman announced a
$14-million investment in sustainable proj-
ects, including hybrid buses and an alterna-
tive-fuel vehicle fleet as a means to reduce
fossil fuel use. LSA also expanded after Cole-
man's announcement, offering an academic
minor in sustainability through the Program
in the Environment. "I want the message to
be clear: Sustainability defines the University
of Michigan," Coleman said.
While Coleman argues the University's
commitment to sustainability is clear, admin-
istrators have been opaque about the school's
investments in fossil fuels. Though Michigan
law protects specific investment data from
being made public, the University should be
held accountable for how it spends money
donated by the community it represents.
The University's investment office provides
a breakdown by percentage of the school's
funds that are spent on various types of
investments. According to statements made
Monday by Erik Lundberg, the University's
chief investment officer, natural resources
account for 9.3 percent of current invest-
ments. Making a further distinction between
fossil fuels and alternative energy sources
would add a level of accountability to a pro-
cess in which many students and community
members demand more transparency.
Currently, specific data on the Univer-
sity's endowment investments in the fossil

fuel industry are not available to the public,
although the divest campaign estimates the
current total to be over $900 million. The
University's endowment ranks as the second
largest among public universities and sev-
enth largest of any university in the United
States, in part due to the profitability of these
investments. The purpose of the endowment
is to provide for the continued operations and
financial growth of the University, a goal that
is not at odds with its environmental responsi-
bility. Industries focused on alternative energy
and other environmentally friendly technolo-
gies are responsible for a growing portion of
our economy. Ownership in these ventures
would be lucrative and in line with the Univer-
sity's self-defined ethical responsibilities and
a commitment that would appeal to potential
endowment donors with similar values.
While the Board of Regents stated pol-
icy is to not let social or political factors
influence the University's investments,
there is a historical precedent for divesting
from funds deemed socially irresponsible.
Instances of this include pulling invest-
ments out of the tobacco industry in the
early 2000s and from South African firms
during apartheid. The University's current
investment in the fossil fuel industry is not
only environmentally irresponsible but also
runs in direct opposition to the research
and social objectives set out by the Universi-
ty's administration and students. CSG needs
to be a driving force in urging the Univer-
sity to follow its own precedent and pursue
responsible financial policies.

TREVOR DOLAN AND RYNE MENHENNICK |
A 20/20 vision

NOEL GORDON|
F(
After a failed Central Student Gov-
ernment presidential bid last year, it
appears youMich is back. And this
time they brought gimmicks! The
latest of which is a YouTube video
featuring some fictional character
named Da'Quan Carter, who is clear-
ly a not-so-veiled attempt at showing
us just how "with it" - read: black -
youMich really is.
Rest assured that the sarcasm
dripping from every word I've writ-
ten so far isn't out of disrespect for
any one person affiliated with you-
Mich. In fact, I happen to like some
of their ideas quite a bit. No, my big-
gest problem with youMich is that I
don't see myself reflected anywhere
in their platform, which is problem-
atic for a political party that claims
to care so much about the students.
Unfortunately, the Da'Quan video
only made things worse by asking the
question: Which students are left out
of the "you" in youMich?
According to their official party
website, youMich is a student orga-
nization that is all about "YOU ...
whether it's about your academics,
your student organization, or your
campus environment." I would love
to take youMich seriously - no, real-
ly I would - but nowhere on their
site do they mention issues that affect
students from underrepresented
communities on campus. There's no
mention of tuition equality. No men-
tion of increasing minority reten-

zwgetting yoi
tion and recruitment. No mention
of fighting tuition hikes. Hell, they
don't even use the words "diversity"
or "social justice" anywhere on their
website - a standard practice for
most CSG political parties even if
they secretly don't give a damn about
creating a more inclusive campus. I
suppose I could take some solace in
the fact that youMich is running a
somewhat diverse slate of candidates
this time around but that means
nothing if the head of the ticket is too
busy focusing on solutions to a rather
narrow set of "everyday problems
and issues that University of Michi-
gan students face."
I'm a University student who just
last week was called a faggot by stu-
dents in my residence hall, who sees
more black and brown boys on Uni-
versity crime alerts than in my politi-
cal science courses, who can only
afford to be here because of an ever-
increasing amount of unsubsidized
loans, who is annoyed by the fact that
CSGgave its largestbudget allocation
to the Entrepreneurship Commis-
sion when there are first-generation
college students struggling just to be
here. Do these problems not count
because they affect students who
don't fall under the "you" in you-
Mich? Maybe they do, but you sure
as hell wouldn't know it by watching
the Da'Quan Carter video. The only
thing I learned about youMich after
watching the clip was that even CSG

presidential candidates are capable
of cultural appropriation when it
suits their political ambitions.
Perhaps I'm being too hard on
youMich, but then again, at least
momentUM has pledged to "increase
cultural dialogue between student
organizations." Even the indepen-
dent candidates have a whole section
of their website dedicated to building
"a global and diverse U-M." Appar-
ently, youMich is one of the only CSG
political parties not to get the memo:
Diversity is "in" this season. Look
no further than the last presidential
election, in which President Barack
Obama crushed Mitt Romney, in
large part due to changing racial and
gender demographics. Republicans
got whipped badly - to the point
where they've finally begun to real-
ize that you can't win general elec-
tions by alienating women, LGBTQ
folks, people of color and poor peo-
ple. Hopefully, youMich learns a
similar lesson.
Being the political man that I
am, I'm going to vote for forUM.
Although they're far from perfect,
forUM is the only party in this race
with a demonstrated track record
of supporting students from under-
represented communities. But, more
importantly, they're unafraid to see
the student body in more colors than
maize and blue.

Providing a secure education for our youth is
an essential responsibility of the state govern-
ment. In Michigan, we need our state govern-
ment to step up now. Despite being home to two
of the top 30 public universities in the United
States, Michigan ranks 36th in the nation in
college attainment. Michigan's Senate Demo-
cratic Caucus, led by Ann Arbor's own Rep.
Rebekah Warren, has put forward a proposal
that would propel our state to the forefront on
this issue and make Michigan a leader on edu-
cation policy in the United States.
The proposed Michigan 2020 Plan would
award any high school graduate in the state of
Michigan $10,617 per year to put towards the
payment of tuition at any college in Michigan.
The grants would be available to any student,
whether educated in a private school, a pub-
lic school or at home and would increase over
time to match rising tuition rates.
The Michigan 2020 Plan was first intro-
duced during the 2012 legislative session.
Despite the support of the entire Michigan
Democratic Caucus, the Republican-con-
trolled Senate didn't allow the bill to pass
beyond the hearing stage. The bill has been
revived this session, and Gretchen Whitmer,
senate minority leader, says that the 2020
Plan is her highest priority for 2013. Senate
Democrats recognize the importance of high-
er education to Michigan residents and hope
to "drive Michigan into the 21st century."
Students at the University understand
firsthand the difficulties of affording a college
education. The skyrocketing costs of tuition
at the University and across the state have
saddled current students with overwhelming
student loan debt and deterred students from
even applying to schools like Michigan just
because the costs seem too high.
Not only will the Michigan 2020 Plan help
students attain higher education, but it will
also spur an important economic stimulus.
Whitmer has said that the state of Michi-

gan needs to produce "a million new degree
holders by 2025 if we are going to be a place
to do business. This could be a game-changer
for Michigan." The 2020 Plan will encour-
age parents and young people to stay in the
state of Michigan to experience the benefits
of this plan, hopefully stemming the popula-
tion slump that our state has experienced for
the past decade while attracting a diverse and
well-trained workforce as our state moves
away from manufacturing as a primary
source of employment.
The 2020 Plan would be funded by a com-
bination of the elimination of corporate tax
incentives, of which the state of Michigan
awards some $35 billion every year, and an
elimination of some of the $28 billion in-state
contracts. Whitmer proposes that some of the
money from both of these sources be diverted
to pay for the plan, thus preventing tax pay-
ing families from incurring any of the costs.
The Michigan 2020 Plan provides oppor-
tunities for those who wouldn't otherwise
have them. With the increasing cost of col-
lege, more and more low-income families are
shying away from saddling their kids with
tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and, con-
sequently, qualified students are unable to
attend schools like the University of Michi-
gan because of the cost.
Attending a Michigan college requires
hard work and dedication on the part of the
student. We should reward students' hard
work by allowing them to continue their edu-
cational achievement rather than putting up
financial barriers. Education is an invest-
ment. The Michigan 2020 Plan recognizes
the importance of investing in the future,
and, through easing access to higher educa-
tion, hopes to reap the returns of a more edu-
cated and skilled Michigan workforce.

a 24-note scale. In Indian music,
there's a 22-note scale - now
that's tough to handle. There
are six-, 19- and 31-note systems
used in some European music,
and in Indonesia there are five-
and seven-note systems. These
note divisions are so different
from our standard Western tra-
dition that sometimes our ears
can't even process the music.
Music is supposed to be a uni-
versal language, but sometimes
musical barriers are ingrained.
Top-40 radio is one kind of musi-
cal conformity, but the 12-note
scale is a wall that many people
in the West have never seen
beyond. This kind of conformity
is brain-deep: The World Sci-
ence Festival did a presentation
called "Notes & Neurons" that
delved into both the scientific
and artistic reality of this devel-
opmental phenomenon.
These explorations reveal an
even more confusing world for
the musician. Hooks, beats and
other relatable musical formu-
lae are essential to connecting
with the listener, but at the same
time there is a vastness of musi-
cal potential that can only be
reached by escaping the famil-
iar rhythms and the predefined
melodic systems. An artist can
spend a lifetime delving through
history to form a solid foun-
dation of context, and he can
spend another reaching out into
oblivion trying to find his most
personal sounds to achieve pure
expression, but the crucial effort
lies in finding the best way to do
both.

Surprises all around in
Olympus Has Fallen'

By MAYANK MATHUR
For the Daily
As a film, "Olympus Has
Fallen" is never stronger than
when tested: It excels in areas it
isn't expected
to, and falls
flat when it's
meant to fly Olympus
high. Directed Has Fallen
by Antoine
Fuqua ("Train- At Quality 16
ing Day"), the and Rave
film presents HmDistrict
itself as a cross Im
between "Die
Hard" and "Air Force One" in
an attempt to combine political
intrigue with kick-ass action
sequences. However, for a film
produced by Millennium Films
("Rambo," "The Expendables"),
the final product is a poorly exe-
cuted action flick that surprises
you in its quietest moments and
forces you to yawn when you
should be at the edge of your
seat.
The film focuses on former
U.S. Army Ranger Mike Ban-
ning (Gerard Butler, "Coriola-
nus") as he navigates his way
through a White House invaded
by North Korean terrorists in an
attempt to save President Ben-
jamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart,
"The Dark Knight"). Morgan
Freeman ("The Dark Knight
Rises") plays Alan Trumbull,
the Speaker of the House, who
is thrust into the role of acting,
president as a result of the hos-
tage situation. The well paced
film runs two parallel stories,
as one focuses on Trumbull's
negotiation attempts with the

Basement Arts to explore
the humor of a'Gap Yah'

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Arts Writer
At some point during their
college career, every student
dreams of taking a year off, trav-
eling the world
and doing a lit- Gap Yah

ing. Basement Thursday,
Arts's "Gap Friday and

title mimics at7 p.m.
the British- Walgreen
accented "gap

and examines Free
the gap year
experiences of one group of
friends.
Not to be confused with the
popular viral video of the same
name, "Gap Yah" is an original
work written by Declan Sheah-
an, a School of Music, Theatre
& Dance junior and one-year
transfer student from the Uni-
versity of Warwick. "Gap Yah"
was one of a few plays chosen by
Basement Arts to perform dur-
ing their winter season.
Sheahan serves as co-director
along with MT&D junior Nicole
Gellman.
Loosely based on Sheahan's
own gap year experiences,
"Gap Yah" focuses on four Brit-
ish seniors as they take a year
off from school to travel. In the
process, they learn about them-

Social network
is moving in the
wrong direction
By BRIANNE JOHNSON
SeniorArts Editor
Facebook is not perfect: The site
suggests I befriend ex-friends; tai-
lors commercial advertisements
to an audience far more conser-
vative and denture-inclined than
me; and once mistagged me for a
distantuncle. But hashtags, Zuck-
erberg? You've gone too far this
time. #DoNotWant
In a recent report, The Wall
Street Journal hinted that Face-
book may soon hitch itself to
Twitter's hashtag bandwagon,
allowing users to further drag
cyberspace into the pits of unnec-
essarily tagged #hell.
Am I being dramatic? #Sor-
ryNotSorry
See? I've employed three
hashtags within 80 words and,
already, you wince. Did the joke
get too old too soon? Are you
frustrated by my lack of spacing?
At what age did you realize that
punctuation is prohibited, and
you just can't tag a smiley face?
The hashtag is not what it once
was - or maybe it is, and we've
just ripped it from its original
OPERA
From Page 1A
geous," said director Kay Castal-
do. "We haven't done a lot of
German opera here. I felt that
it was time for the students to
work with the German language,
because they need to learn and
experience that."
Castaldo has been part of mul-
tiple productions in esteemed
companies worldwide, includ-
ing Teatro Colon, Florida Grand
Opera, LOpera de Montreal,
Cincinnati Opera and the Opera
Company of Philadelphia. This
is her first year as an MT&D
associate professor. "Ariadne auf
Naxos" will be Castaldo's first
production as a faculty member.
"Ariadne auf Naxos"'s first act
introduces the audience to the
wealthiest man in Vienna, who
hao rganizeal a vish rdinner to

purpose of ironic amusement.
But its system of classification
- of compiling and connecting
related bits of information and
eager Internet users - allowed
a (perhaps false) sense of cura-
torship. We could assign labels
to our 140-character thoughts,
assort Tumblr rants with the
simple addition of a "personal"
tag and virtually collect pieces
of information relevant to any
subject with one easy click. Life
was simple, hashtags were sparse
and friends were less tempted to
block you. Probably.
But times have changed, and
I unfollowed you three months
ago. #SorryNot ... You get it.
The hashtag has lost its signifi-
cance. It's wrung dry, plastered
in packs in your Instagram cap-
tion. Posting a picture of you and
your one-and-only? Don't forget
to hashtag the following (and,
yes, all are 100-percent neces-
sary): #Couple #Love #Kissing
#LoveYou #Boyfriend #Sexy
#Food #Happy #Baby #SoInLove
#ImBetterThanYou
If not for the sake of your
schmoozy overindulgence, the
hashtag can also act as a side
thought. Computer-mediated
communication seems to have
caused a complete inability to
decipher one's textual tone. How
serious, sarcastic, friendly or
honor his most recent art acqui-
sition. In order to entertain his
guests, he recruits an eminent
operacompanyto perform aseri-
ous, tragic opera performance
in light of the new painting. A
song-and-dance show from a
capering troupe of comedians is
supposed to follow. When time
grows tight, the opera and the
comedians are informed that
they must perform together. The
second act allows the audience
to see how the opera within an
opera takes form.
"This particular opera is the
battle of comedy and tragedy.
Directors are always looking for
the big, dramatic action of the
piece," Castaldo said. "In this
case, it's transformation. We see
the comedy transformed; we see
the opera transformed. It's an
exciting theatrical event to see
because it's really fun and color-
ful. ut it's also mvstinl in torms

flirty was that message? Does
your Twitter audience under-
stand dry humor? Have no fear
- the hashtag is, I guess, here. It's
like the medium through which
the implicit becomes explicit, and
it may or may not have saved a few
social lives. Thank you, hashtag.
But still, your service is not need-
ed, or welcome, on Facebook.
Its use has further evolved, as
friend after friend has responded
tomyquestion- "What doyouuse
hashtags for?" - with the same
answer: It's a joke. Our hashtags
are mere irony slapped onto the
ends of text messages and tweets
with sarcasm. Because, c'mon,
you don't take hashtags seriously
- does anyone, these days?
Maybe not, but Facebook seems
to want you to. Zuckerberg, I'm
already this closeto jumping ship -
another onslaughtof hashtags may
just hurl me over the edge. And to
where do you expect me to dog-
gie-paddle to safety? The "new"
Myspace? Google+?#lol #no
Facebook may not be perfect,
but the ways in which it distin-
guishes itself from the slew of
social networking sites are why
we even still use it. Why use Face-
book if Twitter offers the same
experience, only simpler? Why
use Facebook if it only adopts the
worst aspects of other sites? Why
use Facebook? You won't.
of the themes that are really
important to us."
"Ariadne auf Naxos" is a
vibrant productionthat colors the
stage some of Strauss's most com-
pelling music. It simultaneously
plays with the universal subject
of love, money and high art.
"We see ourselves in a certain
way in life. We have this clear
view of who we might be. We're
defined by our jobs, our social
strata and our relationships. We
have a very clear definition of
who we are," Castaldo said. "And
then, one day, we fall in love and
everything around us explodes
and we're transformed.
She continued: "This is the
big issue here. This is the human
condition. We think we have it all
organized and we're delighted
when something bigger than us,
when something more wonder-
ful than us, comes into our lives
nnd iuneownoes it."

Eep Crood (Emma Stone,

The Croods live a life of safety

arrives bearing a warning of
the end of the world, Eep and

'M' left out of barrage

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Playing on Stanford's home
court of Maple Pavilion, the
Michigan women's basketball
team knew it would be a battle
against one of the best programs
in the country. With their sea-
son on the line, the Wolverines
needed to play their best basket-
ball of the year to have any chance
to advance to the Sweet 16 for the
first time in program history.
Things looked promising for
Michigan
(9-7BigTen, MICHIGAN 40
22-11 over- STANFORD 73
all) when
senior guard Jenny Ryan swished
a 3-pointer at the 18:29 mark in
the first half to tie the early game,
3-3.
But on the next possession for
top-seeded Stanford (17-1 Pac
12, 33-2), junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike tapped out a missed
shot to Joslyn Tinkle, who put the
ball back in for an easy layup, giv-
ing the Cardinal a two-point lead.
That would only start the scor-
ing barrage for Stanford, as it
continued to make shot after shot
from deep in its 73-40 blowout
I victory.
"Anytime you start a game,
you want to start with the first
punch, and they started com-
fortably, making all those shots,"
Ryan said. "Once they got on that
roll, they just kept going and it
was their night. They started off
strong and never looked back."
Leading the way for the Car-
dinal was Tinkle, who made her
first four shots from the field to
post 11 points in the first stanza
in a shade over seven minutes
of action. She finished with a
team-high 21 points on 7-for-10
shooting while grabbing seven
rebounds.

guarding threes compounded, as

On Sunday, Villanova coach
Harry Peretta predicted that the
Michigan women's basketball
team would need 10 a-pointers to
topple Stanford in the 2nd round
of the NCAA tournament.
Though by the end of Tues-
day's lopsided defeat, it wasn't
the Wolverines who fulfilled Per-
etta's ambitious quota.
The Cardinal buried 12
3-pointers and shot 48-percent
from behind the arc en route to
a 73-40 victory over Michigan. If
it wasn't already a tall order for
the eighth-seeded Wolverines
to upset a top-seeded Stanford
squad at home, it didn't help that
the Cardinal shot nearly 54-per-
cent from the floor.
"I don't think Stanford had
been shooting the ball from
the outside that well prior to
tonight," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "They just
came out on fire."
Not only was Stanford on fire,
but the Wolverines struggled to
find any consistency against the
stifling Cardinal defense.
Senior guard Jenny Ryan
agreed with Peretta's predic-
tion, and gave the Wolverines a
glimpse of hope in the opening
minutes after exchanging three-
pointers with the Cardinal. But
soon after, the scoring exchange
clearlybecame aone-sided affair.
Michigan simply couldn't
find the bottom of the net for
the remainder of the contest,
recording a dismal 29.2 percent
shooting performance. In a game
where the Wolverines desper-
ately needed to be efficient from
behind the arc, they made only
three of 16 attempts.
If Michigan had any chance
at accomplishing such a monu-
mental upset, it would've come
from the sharpshooting of their
leading scorer, senior guard Kate

Thompson. Thompson, who
barely eclipsed the 1,000-career
point mark in her final game, hit
only one of 11 attempts from the
field while failing to bury a single
long-range jumper.
In preparation for Stanford,
the Wolverines were adamant
about containing the Cardinal's
elite center, Chiney Oguwmike.
Michigan publicly admitted their
game plan would force Stanford's
outside shooting, not Ogwumike,
to lead the Cardinal to the Sweet
16.
And the Cardinal would make
them pay.
Stanford forward Joslyn Tin-
kle was red hot from the perim-
eter, nailing all five of her 3-point
attempts during a 21-point per-
formance. As the Wolverines
eliminated any post-game in
their zone defense, the Cardinal
continued to drain the ball from
beyond the arc.
"Credit to them for shooting
the way they did," said senior for-
ward Rachel Sheffer. "We tried
to take away their post. We had
pretty good success doing that,
but they just kept hitting shot
after shot."
If there was any question as
to why Stanford deserved a top
seed in the Spokane region, its
shooting performance against
Michigan added yet another
facet to the already dangerous
squad. The Wolverines' chances
ofupsettingone of the bestteams
in the nation were already slim,
but it's nearly impossible to beat
any team that shoots lights-out
from attempts that might have
counted on an NBA court.
"I don't think we really rec-
ognized what kind of range that
they had on their jump shots,"
Barnes Arico said. "They weren't
just threes, they were pretty
far back behind the line. I don't
know if we've had to come out on
that many shooters that deep all
year long."

beyond the arc in the first half
to comfortably push its lead to
20-plus points.
"They really shared the basket-
ball extremely well and knocked
down shots," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "Some were
open shots. Some were tough
shots. I was very impressed with
how they played tonight. I can
see why they're the number one
seed."
Meanwhile, Michigan went
0-for-6 from deep following
Ryan's triple to begin its night
of scoring. Five of those missed
attempts were by senior forward
Kate Thompson, who posted just
three points in the firsthalf as the
Wolverines were outshot 60-per-
cent to 27-percent from the field.
But shooting wasn't the only
issue for Michigan. The Wolver-
ines managed just eight rebounds
in the first half, while Stanford
had 15 in the stanza - Ogwumike
had eight by herself and 15 in the

game. Michigan finished with
just 17, paling in comparison to
the Cardinal's 34.
"We didn't even have an oppor-
tunity to grab any because they
made pretty much all the shots
that they took," Barnes Arico
said. "We knew (Ogwumike)
would be difficult. I thought we
did a decent job at times on her.
They're were tips and deflections
that we weren't able to come up
with loose balls. And I thought
that really hurt us compared to
our actual rebounding on her. She
kept balls alive."
Down by 25 points at halftime,
the only chance that the Wol-
verines had at a comeback was
to shoot at the extreme rate that
Stanford did to begin the game.
That didn't happen.
The Cardinal continued to
shoot the lights out of the gym,
knocking down four more
3-pointers as it coasted between
high 20-point and low 30-point

leads in the half.
While Ryan would go on to
lead to Michigan with 11 points
on 5-for-5 shooting, it was all
for moot, as the captain's colle-
giate career came to an end. The
loss also marked the end for four
other Wolverine seniors, Thomp-
son and forwards Rachel Sheffer,
Nya Jordan and Sam Arnold. The
seniors ended their careers with
80 wins, making them the win-
ningest class in Michigan history.
Michigan is now eliminated
from the NCAA Tournament,
and Stanford will advance to the
Sweet 16 to play Georgia. After
the way it played tonight, Barnes
Arico has no doubts Stanford can
win it all.
"You are not 33-2 and not an
outstandingbasketball team," she
said. "The teams that they lost to
are incredible teams to have that
record. I think if they continue to
play that way, they can challenge
for the National Championship."

BASEBALL
ivichigan's new probmem Finally, a home game

V

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
March and April are odd
months for top-tier college bas-
ketball programs.
In March, there are the ups-
and-downs of the NCAA Tour-
nament - elation followed by
disappointment for all but one
college program. For college bas-
ketball fans, it's the best month of
the year.
But then comes April, one of
the worst months of the college
basketball year, where a wash of
talented players from powerhouse
programs forego remaining years
of eligibility to enter the NBA
Draft.
This is a problem for elite pro-
grams, and until very recently, one
that Michigan hadn't grappled
with.
Butnow,withaninfluxoffresh-
man talent, along with under-the-
radar players developed in Ann
Arbor, the problem has become
very real for the Wolverines.
"You don't know - they are 18
years old," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "You get them, and
you're hoping they will be here
and unpack their bags, or, that
they are in a situation if their sec-
and or third year that is too good
to pass up to leave. There's the
whole process everybody goes
through, and that's part of what
all us coaches are dealing with
right now."
This year, Michigan is dealing
with two kinds of potential depar-
tures - highly-recruited fresh-
men with enough talent to leave
for the NBA early, and players who
were overlooked as recruits that
developed their talent in college.
Freshman forward Glenn Rob-
inson III fills in the former cate-
gory; based on physical attributes
alone, he could be drafted in the
first round. He struggled at times
against Big Ten competition, but
the NBA puts a lot of stock in
potential, and Robinson has loads
of it.
The two players in the latter

Michigan basketball coach John Bellein is preparing for a veteran Knasas team that balances freshman and veteran talent.

category are sophomore point
guard Trey Burke and junior
forward Tim Hardaway Jr. It's
almost a foregone conclusion that
Burke - who almost left after his
freshman year - willbe gone after
this season. His team has done
well, getting to the Sweet 16 for
the first time since 1994, and he's
established himself as the premier
point guard in the country, win-
ning Sport's Illustrated's Player of
the Year award.
Hardaway is the bigger ques-
tion. He has improved on the
inconsistent streaks that plagued
him last year, but still isn't listed
in the first round of many mock
drafts.
In March, during the Big
Dance, having this amount of tal-
ent is a beautiful thing. In April,
when the slippers come off, it can
be very dangerous.
"The only approach you can
have is that you have to really
build your relationships with
players here and make it the best
place they can be without going to
the point where you aren't teach-
ing them to be a man," Beilein
said. "You just do what you do,
but you can't control itnas much as
you think you could control it. You

just try to make that atmosphere
which enriches their life and they
appreciate it."
The best example of figuring
out how to best balance talent and
longevity will be on the opposite
bench during Michigan's game
against Kansas on Friday. Bill Self
leads a Jayhawks team riding the
line between talented and too tal-
ented; a team that has four seniors
as its top five scorers, yet recently
held a senior day ceremony for
freshman Ben McLemore - the
team's leading scorer - in antici-
pation thathe will leave early next
year.
The Jayhawks have successful-
ly balanced freshman talent with
veteran talent this year, all with a
top-five recruiting class waiting in
the wings.
Self has been one of the best
models for managing elite talent
since the NBA passed the "one-
and-done" rule, which forced
high-school players to be at least
19 years old or be one year out of
high school before entering the
NBA Draft.
There are currently 13 former
Kansas players on NBA rosters, a
list that includes one-and-dones
(Xavier Henry), four-year players

(Nick Collison) and everything in
between (Mario Chalmers,Thom-
as Robinson, etc.). The Jayhawks
have sent more players to the NBA
than most other college programs
but have still made the Final Four
twice since 2005, winning tourna-
ment in 2008.
As Beilein is finding, there is a
fine line between recruiting tal-
ent and recruiting the elite type
of talent that will leave a program
after a year. As Michigan contin-
ues to elevate itself in the world of
college basketball recruiting - all
three signed recruits for nextyear
are atnleastfour-stars - it will con-
tinue to try and find the balance,
just like Self and Kansas.
"Coaches have recruited too
well, really well, and got them-
selves fired because they didn't
have a roster in a couple years
because everybody is in the
league," Beilein said. "You recruit
too low, and you are going to get
yourself fired because you don't
have good enough players. That's
the thing you have to continue to
work through. We have a couple
guys coming out of high school
that were not seen as pro pros-
pects that are now pro prospects.
"It's a good problem to have."

McGary, football star?

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Following its 3-1 loss to Notre
Dame on Sunday in the CCHA
Championship game that ended
its 22-year streak of NCAA
Tournament appearances, the
Michigan hockey team is already
focusing on rebuilding its streak
from one.
But two of NOTEBOOK
the Wolverines'
top defensemen might throw a
wrench in those plans. Fresh-
* man Jacob Trouba and junior Jon
Merrill will decide in the upcom-
ing weeks whether or not to leave
Michigan and play in the NHL.
The Winnipeg Jets drafted
Trouba in the first round this past
summer, and Merrill was a set-
ond-round pick by the New Jersey
Devils in 2010.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
met with both players earlier in
the week to weigh their options
and he already has an inkling as to
what Merrill might do.
"I'm leaning towards it's going
to be time for Jonny to move,"
Berenson said. "I think (the Dev-
Sils) have been really patient. They
could have signed him after his
first year."
Merrill has certainly faced set-
backs since his stellar freshman
campaign when he immediately
established himself as an impact
player. There was discussion as to
whether he would leave atnthe end
of his sophomore year, or even in
the middle of the season, follow-
ing a lengthy half-season suspen-
sion for a violation of team rules.
It seems to be more of a toss up
as to what Trouba - arguably the
Wolverines' best player - might
do, though.
"What I feel and what I think is
best for me is what I'll do." Trouba
said. "There's not really a wrong
decision to make, but there's defi-
nitely one that's more beneficial.
"Being here has been probably
one of the most fun years I've ever
had playing hockey on and off the
ice. This is a lot of fun and it's a
hard place to leave. Getting my
education is something I want to

do and another year towards that
would be a bigstep."
Berenson said he wouldn't be
surprised if Trouba does decide
to stay in Ann Arbor, citing that
a second year of college hockey
could be exponentially beneficial
for his growth and maturation.
The Wolverines have attrib-
uted their turnaround this season
to the depth of the blue line. But
with Trouba and Merrill's uncer-
tain statuses combined with the
graduation of senior Lee Moffie,
there are some question marks as
to which current players can step
up to fill the gap and assist the
transition of the three incoming
freshmen defensemen.
"If we lost Merrill, you don't
replace Jonny Merrill at the
level he was playing," Berenson
said. "Kevin Clare should be able
to step in and add to our top-5
(defensemen), and you know Mac
Bennett should be ready to have
his absolutely best year."
BERENSON BACK: Berenson
signed a three-year extension on
his contract this summer to keep
him on through the Wolverines'
2015-16 campaign.
Though the veteran coach has
expressed excitement at Michi-
A

gan's inaugural year in the newly-
formed Big Ten hockey conference
and a chance at redemption after
finishing this past season below
.500, there were times during
the 2012-13 season when he ques-
tioned whether or not he should
return to man the program.
"I want to do what's best for
the program," Berenson said. "If
this team wasn't getting any bet-
ter I would have thought about
not coming back next year. I don't
want to get in the way of this pro-
gram doing well."
ON THE ROAD AGAIN: The
coaching staff has already started
to lay plans for the non-conference
portion of its schedule. Berenson
is scheduling games with Boston
College, Boston University, New
Hampshire and Nebraska-Oma-
ha.
"I think we're continuing to
keep our competitive relationship
open with schools like BU, BC and
UNH," Berenson said. "We want
to play the best programs in the
east and continue to do that.
There are currently no plans
to schedule games with for-
mer CCHA teams such as Ferris
State, Western Michigan or Notre
Dame.

Daily Sports Editor
Mitch McGary recently won
the starting job for the Michigan
basketball team, but the fresh-
man already has another offer for
a starting position. It's just in a
different sport.
"I already promised him he'd
be a five-technique right away,
and we'd get him a lot of sacks,"
said Michigan football defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison. "No
question about it. I love him. It's
funny, I saw him one time the
team was
going to eat NOTEBOOK
somewhere,
I just happened to run into him
when my wife and I were out. I
had never stood next to him, and
I just looked at him and all I kept
thinking was 'Wow, would he be
good as a five-technique."'
So yes, Mattison was joking
- or at least dreaming - but add-
ing McGary would fit Mattison's
theory of the more defensive
lineman, the better. In the third
spring under the current coach-
ing staff, the Michigan front is
getting closer to Mattison's goal
of having a full rotation of players
onthe defensive line.
"I've always wanted to do this,
and atnother places, I've been able
to do this - I love having the abil-
ity to rotate," Mattison said.
The rotation features main-
stays from last year like redshirt
sophomore Keith Heitzman,
fifth-year senior Quinton Wash-
ington, a bulked-up junior Frank
Clark and senior Jibreel Black.
And the Wolverines have added
more depth through younger
players including redshirt fresh-
man Tom Strobel, a healthy red-
shirt freshman Chris Wormley
and sophomore Mario Ojemudia.
Mattison said he joked in film
study that any lineman who
looked tired would be watching
games from the sideline with him
- a luxury that Michigan hasn't
had in recent years.
"Then I made a serious com-
ment to them," Mattison said. "I
said, 'Guys, you have to under-
stand that all I'm trying to ask is
that you go as hard as you can go,

and it's never wrong for you to
raise your hand. If you can'tgo as
hard as we want you to go, raise
your hand and we'll develop a
guy that can come in rightnbehind
you, and now that guy goes hard.'
When we get that up front, then
you can get a front that you're
going to really like watching
because they're going to go hard
every snap."
BEYER'S MARKET: Mattison
is confident enough in the depth
at line to move junior Brennen
Beyer to strong-side linebacker.
Beyer had seen action as a rush
end last season.
The move comes in the wake of
the injury to redshirt junior Jake
Ryan, who tore his ACL last week
in practice and will likely miss
significanttime.
Fifth-year senior Cameron
Gordon is the front-runner for
the starting spot at SAM line-
backer, but Beyer can add'depth.
He'll also provide a pass-rushing
presence in the nickel package,
which as Mattison explained,
uses the strong-side linebacker as
a rusher.
Mattison said the move is tem-
porary, and Beyer will move back
to the line when Ryan returns.
WIDER RECEIVERS: For the
last several years, the wide out
position has been filled by a band
of Lilliputians. Roy Roundtree,

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Freshmanforward Mitch McGary has been likened to a football player on the court. 4

who graduated last year, stood
at just 6-foot. Fifth-year senior
Jeremy Gallon, this year's No.
1 receiver, is just 5-foot-8. And
senior Drew Dileo isn't much
taller, at 5-foot-10.
Enter sophomore Amara Dar-
boh and redshirt freshman Jehu
Chesson. The two have added
an element of speed and size to a
rather diminutive corps of receiv-
ers.
"They have some big-play abil-
ity," said offensive coordinator Al
Borges. "We've won a few jump
balls. Lost a few, but we haven't
lost them all."
Chesson redshirted last sea-
son, and Darboh played only on c
special teams, but each will have
a chance to make significant con- *
tributions in their second year in
the program. Other than Gallon
and Dileo, no receiver has shown
much consistency. Chesson
(6-foot-3) and Darboh (6-foot-2)
each have frames more in line
with Borges' preferences.
"The littler guys have done a
great job for us, but we did want
to get more range at the position
and those two offer it to you,"
Borges said.
NOTE: Former defensive line-
man Chris Rock, who left the
program a year ago, has walked
on at Ohio State according to
Tony Gerdman of theozone.net.

Wednesday, March 27, 2013 // The Statement7B

letter from the editor
In all of my previous columns regarding books (all two of
them) I've said in some way or another that I have no authority to
really judge the literary pieces I write about, yet here I am at the
helm of this issue selecting the pieces that go inside. So, I want to
thank Haley Goldberg for letting me choose these pieces after I've
made it publicly known that I don't think I can. Haley, thank you.
I read a lot (you're thinking, no shit, Sherlock, you write
about reading for goodness sake) but reading without a pen in
my hand to annotate and look for critical and stylistic elements in
the text is rare. I always look at writing with the eye of an English
major. So when I picked pieces for this, I tried to, well, not read
the submissions like that. I tried to revert back to the fifth-grader-
who-reads-under-blankets-past-bedtime-because-books-are-
your-best-friend type of reader, and instead of looking for all the
academic hogwash, just reading them for what they are. That
being said, the submissions I got (and there were a lot) were
impressive to say the least. Y'all can write! And so there I sat,
crouched over the submissions and frazzled in a coffee shop, and I
had to make the hard decisions.
I hope what I chose, and what graces these pages, takes
you to some new places and makes you think a little bit differently.

these are my people
who mistreat cashmere sweaters
stolen Salvation Army
who fish boxes Tiffany blue
upturn garbage can NewYorkCity
who memorize Bryant Park
newness, plaster discarded circulation leaflets
in grimy spirals against a mouthy palate
who travel by discount commuter train
borrowed boxcar redeye voyage
who never buy
tickets to sold out shows,

who scratch the bottom of the barrel
and reevaluate the notion of food,
who buy the biggest, cheapest bottles
of foulest champagne and toast wordless
speeches
to friends they cannot afford to keep
who have never touched their foot soles against
another country's soil-stem
and spend their days manual-clutch training
optic nerve lenses in worship
of counterfeit grail that manic-gleam reflects
the uninhabitable absence of Here.

ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND

She was one of those Greenpeace
tree huggers; that much was obvious.
Combs were made of plastic, made
of oil, made of crushed-up dinosaur
parts: theyweren'tvegan, shewouldn't
use them, she had dreadlocks. They
reminded me of hemp rope, and they
scratched against the sandpaper of my
lazy July beard when we kissed. Once
one brushed against my neck when
she was biting my ear and I felt like I
was being hung. Hanged. Whichever.
Not a bad way to go, though. If I had to
kick it, I wanted someone to help me
get off in the process. Death in orgasm
would get me damned, but when you
spend summers on a farm in Nebraska
hell ain't so far off as it is.
She told me her name was
Merrily. Like the song, I said, and
started to sing. We roll along, roll
along, roll along. Shut up, you prick,
it's my goddamn name, she said.
Okay, I said. Sorry, I said. Anyway,
we rolled along and along and life
was but a hot summer dream, one
of those dreams you have when the
fan stops working after you fall
asleep and you don't have central air
because you live in fucking central
Nebraska and your brain overheats
and the curtains of your mind come
up and show the craziest, most
unbelievable, most awesome shit
going on onstage. That was how our
summer went.

Neither of us had a car, which was
fine because it would have taken forty-
five minutes to drive to the nearest
shopping mall and neither of us liked
shopping anyway, much less that
awkward silence when you're in a car
with people you don't know that well
and you turn on the radio to fill it only
to spend the whole time wondering if
they're secretly judging you because of
your music. Plus, imagine how many
dinosaurs that would've wasted. We
found ways to fill the summer days,
alternative forms of energy. Fuck locally,
she'd said with a shrug, and we explored
my uncle's farm and each other top to
bottom. Hay lofts, hay stacks, hay bales,
I spent hours pulling pieces of hay out
of her dreads which was harder than
it sounds since you can't really tell the
difference. The hot summer air hung
heavy around us, but I didn't miss the
rainy misty grayness I'd left behind in
Seattle. I got more sunburned than ever
before, until I tanned to the color of
hay bales and the toughness of saddle
leather. I started to think of myself as
a Rastafarian, one of two in the corn
belt, drumming away like a barn dance
from Little House on the Prairie, except
Ma and Pa were stoned and the cider
was Jack Daniels and we were saving
the dinosaurs and the polar bears by
drinking whiskey out of the bottle
without cups and not shaving, either of
us, and fucking locally.

Desire Under the
Mosquito Netting
By Giancarlo Buonomo

"Hunger is good discipline and you
learn from it."
Ernest Hemingway
We shared a cup of tea
in Mysore when I still
felt like Ernest Hemingway
I wondered if the mix of
our sip on the lip
constituted a kiss
Exotic as jackfruit and as juicy
as the Georgia peaches that
you said grew in your backyard in Atlanta
And I believed you
We read A Moveable Feast in the
backseat of an old British car
on our way to town to
buy antibiotics and chocolate

The bindi that you placed on
Hemingway's forehead is still there
We lifted bricks every day
that villagers stacked in neat rows
before we woke in the morning
and yet I referred to the two of us
as the Hebrew slaves and hoped that
together we could dance the straw into
the mud and make bricks
And you laughed
Together we could be
Sahib and the lovely lady
Riding elephants along the Ganges
and hunting tigers in the jungle
Me under my sun-helmet
You under a silk umbrella
Us under the mosquito netting

By Hannah Weiner

if I am yours and you are mine
and this is us,
this is us.
Then these are my hands which are yours
in mine in ours,
then you are my heart (which is yours)
and you are my stars (all of them,
which are yours, even the shooting ones)
and you are my song
that from you I learned how to sing.

Preparation for
Painting Shutters:
A Checklist
By Luc LaFreniere

1. When you pry the shutters from
the office wall
be sure to let the dayspring's fore-
most teeth
nip loose the clutched fibers of your
thawing skin.
2. When you sweep the chick-down
yellow shutters
it's fairly important that you brush
musically,
rendering ear-bud tremor to gam-
bol-dance tempo.
3. While scooping up the shutters
for relocation
you must ornament your half-
shucked body in sun,
making sure to gratefully-receive all
orisons of heat.

4. When the shutters are scrubbed
with the jolly suds
you cannot forget to bow to the
bubble-built castles
stoutheartedly sliding down the
unzipped wood grain.
5. When you-on high pressure-
hose down the shutters
it is greatly advised that you cel-
ebrate the cool clack and
splash on the slats as if they were
your own toasty vertebrae.
6. When you have the faded shut-
ters all ready for painting,
leaned along in the garage like spot-
less flaxen piglets
suckling at the sow,
have five strawberries.

The F Train Downtown
By Olivia Lloyd

she wasn't the most beautiful woman,
(those fairy eyelashes...)
and his face wasn't much to write home about,
(that kindness in his glance...)
Butsitting across fromthem onthe subway car,
(these headphones playing nothing...)
I saw the most open, tender love.
(this desire mixed with pity...)
free
unpretentious and easy,
The rest of us should ever be so lucky.
He with closed eyes
and she-seeing the world over fringe of
singular arresting beauty--

kisses his shoulder.
A gentle nudge says,
I am not yours, you are not mine--
We are.
Even on this crowded, smelling subway car,
My darling so dear,
We are.

Your nails are green. Your body is
pink. The tiles are white, and you
are alone. The water is hot and you
are sitting on the floor of the shower try-
ing to pee. It's not working. Not that it's
ever been a problem before, but your blad-
der stubbornly remains half full of piss after
thirty minutes of attempted expulsion. You
wonder if distracting yourself from the
problem at hand may aid in diminishing,
it. You're trying to sing something-any-
thing-and you're just sitting naked on the
floor of your shower in your old bedroom in
your mother's half empty, generally unin-
habited house in Michigan, rememberingall
those nights you did the same damn thing
and daydream about the days when every-
thing would get better. Those were the days.
The-ea ore the avs it blanentoeather soen-'-

never wanted to urinate so badly in your
entirelife.Andyoucan'ttellifit'sstage fright
or sadness or substances, but your bladder
simply refuses to release its liquid prisoner
and you suddenly feel bad for old men who
must have similar tribulations. It's a Friday
night, and if time has taught you anything,
you're never going to be this happy, or this
svelte, or this in love ever again. When you
were younger, you talked to God. You would
finish your homework, run upstairs, fuck
around on your phone for a little while, and
strip naked, slipping into the shower and
melting onto its floor. You'd sing something
until the words became indistinguishable
and then you'd look in the mirror, shift your
body forward so the water would drip down
your face, and you would talk to God. You
weren't even sure ifyou believed in God, but
you thought that maybe if you got the words
out, somehow they might prove their own
importance. And half of the time you would
feel like crying. And some of the time you
would. But you would talk. You'd tell God
about all the things you wish were different,
and hnw n really really really loved so-

please, please,
please, please,
please, please,
please, please,
please, please,
please, please,
please, please,
please," sud-
denly the word
had no meaning,
you would mispro-
nounce it, you would .
forget it ever existed.
Each letter seemed foreign
as it endlessly tumbled out of
mouth, and you would wonde
tell you had no idea what yo
anymore. You would wonder

were just talking to yourse
