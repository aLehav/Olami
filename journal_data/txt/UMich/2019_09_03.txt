University 
of 
Michigan 
student tuition will no longer 
cover 
testing 
for 
sexually 
transmitted 
infections 
at 
University Health Services.
This update is part of UHS 
and Michigan Medicine’s new 
policy 
of 
billing 
students’ 
personal 
insurance 
for 
“laboratory testing, radiology 
x-rays 
and 
ultrasounds 
and allergy injections,” as 

announced in a policy memo 
on July 15. Previously, these 
services 
were 
covered 
by 
the Health Service Fee, a 
mandatory fee of $199 included 
in the tuition paid by U-M Ann 
Arbor students each semester. 
Under the new policy, all 
laboratory tests, including STI 
tests, will be sent to Michigan 
Medicine 
laboratories, 
and 
costs will be billed to students’ 
personal 
health 
insurance. 
There are still no fees for the 
Sexual Assault Exam at UHS, 

which may include an STI 
panel.
According 
to 
the 
U.S. 
Department of Health and 
Human Services, children can 
remain under their parent’s 
health insurance until the 
age of 26. The insurance 
policy holder which for many 
students is their parents may 
receive 
an 
Explanation 
of 
Benefits from the insurance 
company detailing the services 
received at UHS, including an 
STI panel. 

If students are receiving 
services no longer covered by 
their tuition, they will receive 
a flyer detailing the billing 
change and information about 
an 
out-of-pocket 
payment 
option to avoid the EOB. A 
standard STI panel at UHS is 
$90 out-of-pocket. 
Charging students’ personal 
health insurance allows UHS 
to create a revenue stream

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection called the Mardigian 
Library at the University of 
Michigan-Dearborn on Aug. 14 
to book a training session for 
new CBP employees, causing 
worry 
among 
those 
at 
the 
University, a Michigan Journal 
article reported. The request 
was immediately denied due to 
a policy that prohibits renting 
rooms 
to 
organizations 
not 

affiliated with the University or 
the surrounding community. 
Maureen 
Linker, 
interim 
director of the Mardigian Library 
and professor of philosophy 
at U-M Dearborn, urged all 
concerned students, faculty and 
staff to read the University’s 
public statement released on 
Aug. 16. The statement reiterated 
the 
University’s 
commitment 
to protecting students’ private 
information — including their 
immigration 
status 
— 
but 
reminded readers that the three 

University of Michigan campuses 
are not classified as “sanctuary” 
campuses. 
CBP Requests Room on U-M 
Dearborn Campus
The statement also noted 
that CBP, not U.S. Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement 
(ICE), called campus to request 
a room booking. Although both 
organizations 
operate 
under 
the Department of Homeland 
Security, CBP is solely responsible 
for border safety and trade. ICE 
investigates immigration-related 

issues on a nationwide level and 
has been criticized for carrying 
out 
organized 
raids 
against 
undocumented 
Americans. 
Michigan has the second-highest 
rate of ICE arrests in the country, 
with 11.6 per 1,000 immigrants 
apprehended. 
The Michigan Journal article, 
which 
listed 
steps 
students 
should take if approached by ICE 
agents. There was also concern 
ICE raids similar to those this 
past July in Mississippi could 

Starting 
this 
academic 
year, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan will offer a new 
student 
health 
insurance 
plan. The new plan is offered 
by the Blue Care Network 
of Michigan, a change from 
the AETNA plan offered in 
previous 
years. 
The 
plan 
spans all three University 
campuses. 
According 
to 
Laurie 
Burchett, 
administrative 
manager of the University 
Health Service, students are 
not automatically re-enrolled 
in the new plan, and must 
register under the new plan 
during an open enrollment 
period. University students 
have three chances to enroll 
in the new plan to earn 
coverage in 2020. 
The first open enrollment 
period ends September 30, 
and will cover care from Aug. 
24, 2019 to Aug. 23, 2020.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Office 
for 
Institutional 
Equity 
has 
undergone 
a 
number 
of 
operational 
changes 
this 
summer, 
including 
naming Elizabeth Seney as 
the 
University’s 
Title 
IX 
coordinator. 
Seney 
served 
as 
the 
interim 
Title 
IX 
coordinator 
and 
currently 
works as the senior associate 
director for OIE. Historically, 
the 
Title 
IX 
coordinator 
has had the power to make 
the final call as to whether 
students will be found guilty 
of sexual misconduct. 
Additional 
changes 
include 
OIE 
reporting 
directly to Provost Martin 
Philbert 
instead 
of 
the 
Office of Diversity, Equity 
& Inclusion and University 
Human Resources and the 
formulation of a new database 
and case-management system 
to streamline OIE processes. 

The department will also 
relaunch the search for a new 
senior director for OIE with 
asearch advisory committee 
led 
by 
Christine 
Gerdes, 
special counsel to the Provost. 
Currently, 
Jeff 
Frumkin 
serves as the interim senior 
OIE Director. 
The 
changes 
to 
OIE 
— 
the 
office 
responsible 
for 
investigating 
sexual 
misconduct reports, Title IX 
violations and institutional 
bias, among other incidents 
— were implemented with 
the 
hope 
of 
improving 
operations and speeding up 
investigations 
after 
facing 
public criticism over the last 
academic year. 
In Sept. 2018, OIE had to 
alter its sexual misconduct 
policy 
to 
include 
an 
in-person hearing between 
the accuser and the accused 
after a Sixth Circuit Court 
ruling.

Perch, 
an 
online 
research platform created 
by 
a 
team 
of 
mostly 
University of Michigan 
students, 
launched 
Monday. The startup aims 
to connect more students 
and graduates across the 
country 
with 
research 
positions.
Engineering and LSA 
senior 
Akira 
Nishii 
came up with the idea 
for Perch after having 
trouble finding research 
opportunities 
when 
he 
entered 
the 
University. 
He found that outside 
of 
the 
Undergraduate 
Research 
Opportunity 
Program, 
which 
is 
aimed at freshmen and 
sophomores, 
there 
was 

no 
centralized 
system 
that 
listed 
research 
opportunities 
and 
was 
accessible to all students.
“A lot of students are 
relying on very inefficient 
methods, 
like 
cold-
emailing, or relying on 
personal 
connections 
to 
get 
into 
research 
opportunities,” 
Nishii 
said. 
He 
gathered 
a 
team 
of peers, and together 
they started working on 
a solution to centralize 
all 
the 
research 
opportunities. 
Now 
Perch has launched an 
encompassing 
database 
of 
inter-university 
research 
opportunities 
and 
research 
faculty. 
They 
have 
16 
partner 
universities, including the 
University of Michigan, 

Harvard 
and 
the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of Technology.

Nolan 
Kataoka, 
chief 
technology 
officer of Perch and 
Engineering 
senior, 
highlighted 
Perch’s 
future plans for the 
platform.
“In the long term, 
we’d like to have a 
database of all the 
faculty 
in 
all 
the 
universities 
in 
the 
U.S.,” Kataoka said.
Perch 
also 
helps 
graduate 
students 
find 
employment 
and streamlines the 
process 
of 
helping 
graduates 
find 
positions outside of 

academia, Nishii said.
“In 
addition 
to 
the 
database of faculty and 
industrial 
research 
opportunities, 
we’re 
providing 
a 
matching 
algorithm where we help 
search through a Ph.D.’s 
list 
of 
publications, 
qualifications, 
skill 
sets,” Nishii said. “We 
help Ph.D.s identify jobs 
that are most relevant to 
them.”
On campus, Perch is 
partnered with a separate 
student organization at 
the 
University 
called 
Perch Education, which 
aims to expose students 
to the research world. It 
now hosts the Michigan 
Undergraduate Research 
Symposium, 
and 
offers 
courses to equip students 
with the skills to succeed 
in research.
Senior 
Associate 
Librarian at the Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library, 
Jo Angela Oehrli, played 
a 
key 
role 
in 
Perch 
Education and acts as 
an advisor for the Perch 
platform team. Due to her 
background in education, 
she 
was 
able 
to 
help 
construct 
the 
teaching 
curriculum from scratch 
for Perch Education. 
Oehrli first served as 
a library mentor when 
Perch won the Library 
Student Mini Grant, and 
she 
looks 
forward 
to 
the addition of graduate 
opportunities.
“With the skill set of 
these 
Ph.D. 
candidates 
and recent Ph.D. earners … 
the research will be richer 
after 
that 
connection,” 
Oehrli said. “And that can 
make an impact on the 
world as well.”

A lot of students 
are relying on 
very inefficent 
methods, like 
cold- emailing, 
or relying 
on personal 
connections to 
get into research 
opportunities.


There 
were 
also 
complaints 
regarding 
lengthy and inefficient OIE 
reporting processes. 
 One of OIE’s main goals 
is handling complaints as 
equitably as possible, Seney 
said in a sit-down interview 
with The Daily in April. 
“I 
would 
say 
the 
overarching mission really 
is to make sure that the 
University 
is 
responding 
fairly and appropriately to 
concerns that exist,” Seney 
said. “Then, of course, we 
also have a role in preventive 
and educational work as 
well. So, I wouldn’t limit 
our overall mission to just 
responding 
to 
particular 
concerns, but I would say 
that is where we spend a lot 
of time and effort and that’s 
a significant priority.” 
Seney also spoke about 
OIE’s priorities with regards 
to investigations in the April 
interview. She noted how 
the department is tasked 
with dealing with reports 
efficiently 
and 
ensuring 
the safety of everyone on 
campus. 
“I would say our priority 
of 
course 
is 
always 
to 
address all of the matters,” 
Seney said. “And as quickly 
as possible, which is difficult 
to do, especially as we’ve had 
really significant increases 

over the last couple of years 
and the number of reports 
that we’ve received, and 
to do them in that fair and 
appropriate way, make sure 
that people are supported.” 

A public health junior, 
who has chosen to remain 
anonymous due to ongoing 
legal 
action 
surrounding 
her case, went through a 
Title IX investigation last 
year. She said Seney didn’t 
work directly with her case 
but 
interacted 
with 
her 
throughout the process of 
the 
investigation. 
Given 
how she said her situation 
was handled, the junior was 

upset to learn Seney had been 
named Title IX coordinator. 
“Basically, she completely 
disregarded how we were 
feeling and didn’t take us 
seriously for a second,” she 
said. “I’m not very happy 
that 
she’s 
the 
Title 
IX 
coordinator.” 
The Public Health junior 
said OIE’s processes were 
not as fair as Seney had 
described them to be in the 
April interview. 
“Seney, 
OIE 
and 
the 
University as a whole (have) 
taught me throughout this 
process that they don’t care 
about the claimants getting 
justice 
or 
even 
having 
fair investigations or fair 
hearings,” she said. “All they 
only care about is not getting 
sued, and doing whatever it 
takes not to get sued.” 
Nevertheless, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
commended 
Seney’s past work with OIE 
and expressed support for 
her new position. 
“Elizabeth 
Seney 
has 
served 
our 
university 
community 
very 
well 
as 
deputy Title IX coordinator 
and as interim Title IX 
coordinator,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote in an email to The 
Daily. “It was clear she 
was the best candidate for 
this 
important 
leadership 
position within OIE.” 

Clinton and Condoleezza 
Rice, 
former 
National 
Security Adviser Stephen 
Hadley, and former United 
States Ambassador to the 
United Nations Samantha 
Power.
 The Public Policy School 
posted 
the 
schedule 
of 
dates for the upcoming 
speakers last week, with 
lecture 
topics 
ranging 
from U.S.-North Korean 
relations to security in the 
Persian Gulf.
John Ciorciari, director 
of the WDC and associate 
professor of public policy, 
said the idea for the WDC 
began last summer and was 
well-received by the Weiser 
family from its conception.
“Last summer, we started 
a conversation with the 
Weisers about the prospect 
of doing something a little 
bit larger around the theme 
of practical training in 
foreign affairs, and also 
around the theme of policy 
engagement 
with 
the 
diplomatic 
community,” 
Ciorciari said. “They share 
a priority that we have to 
train students not just in 
the classroom, but also in a 
variety of ways outside the 
classroom.”
While 
the 
speaker 
series will bring strong 
figures from the world 
of 
diplomacy 
to 
the 
University this fall, the 
WDC staff itself also boasts 
top leaders and experts 
in foreign policy. WDC 
Senior 
Adviser 
Melvyn 

Levitsky 
served 
as 
the 
United States Ambassador 
to Bulgaria and the United 
States 
Ambassador 
to 
Brazil. 
WDC 
Program 
Coordinator 
Zuzana 
Wiseley previously served 
at various foreign missions 
and was an Assistant to 
the Ambassador of India 
in Bratislava. As the WDC 
grows and student interest 
increases, 
the 
center 
is 
planning 
to 
expand 
the 
international 
policy 
focused curriculum within 
the Public Policy School.
Levitsky explained the 
importance of having a hub 
for foreign affairs in the 
Midwest.
“A lot of the schools that 
teach this kind of work 
are in Washington, D.C.,” 
Levitsky 
said. 
“I 
think 
we’ll offer an alternative of 
being away from inside the 
Beltway, and having good 
instruction, both from our 
regular faculty and from 
people like me who are 
former practitioners, and 
we’re looking forward to 
it.”
Ciorciari also mentioned 
the value of the WDC’s 
location 
within 
the 
Midwest, mentioning the 
University as a leading 
force 
in 
the 
field 
of 
foreign policy. Beyond the 
continuation of leadership 
in the field, Ciorciari said 
the goal of the upcoming 
speaker 
series 
is 
to 
introduce more students 
to the WDC and the robust 
resources the University 
has to offer.
“We really want to be a 
visible leading hub in the 

Midwest for engagement 
with 
foreign 
affairs,” 
Ciorciari said. “We hope 
that this big launch series 
will help to broadcast to 
prospective 
students, 
to 
friends of the University, 
to the general public, to 
policymakers, that U-M, 
which has always been an 
important contributor to 
conversations 
on 
global 
policy issues, is going to 
be even more central going 
forward.”
The WDC also recently 
announced the inaugural 
cohort of Weiser Diplomacy 
Fellows. 
The 
fellows 
receive support for up to 
two years of study within 
the fields of diplomacy and 
foreign affairs and can be 
rewarded up to $20,000 
per year.
Marianna 
Smith 
is 
a 
Master of Public Policy 
student at the Ford School 
and is one of four fellows 
in 
the 
cohort. 
WDC 
Fellows are responsible for 
promoting and advocating 
for the center on campus 
and assisting the WDC staff 
in 
contacting 
potential 
speakers 
for 
upcoming 
events. Smith’s goals as a 
fellow include diversifying 
the 
field 
of 
diplomacy 
and utilizing the WDC’s 
resources to further her 
career.
“My 
goal 
would 
be 
to 
promote 
the 
fellowship to minority or 
underrepresented 
groups 
in 
diplomacy, 
to 
make 
our campus more diverse, 
and to make any career in 
diplomacy more diverse,” 
Smith said. 

take place on the U-M Dearborn 
campus. 
Hani Bawardi, an associate 
professor of history at U-M 
Dearborn, said even though 
CBP was the agency that called 
campus, any DHS presence 
on campus can be a legitimate 
cause for fear. 
“It’s 
no 
surprise 
that 
the students would be very 
concerned given the current 
situation,” Bawardi said. “ICE 
is a very powerful government 
agency with a six-billion-dollar 
budget. It is sort of a byproduct 
of a merger between the former 
Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the U.S. Customs 
Service under the umbrella of 
Homeland Security, and it has 
almost unfettered powers.”
ICE Presence in Michigan 
According 
to 
the 
2018 
Enforcement 
and 
Removal 
report, 
ICE 
made 
158,581 
administrative arrests in the 
2018 fiscal year, as opposed 
to the 143,470 arrests made in 
2017. The number of arrests rose 
partly in response to President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
Executive 
Order 13768, signed Jan. 25, 2017, 
which stated sanctuary cities 
not compliant with ICE orders 
could be denied federal funding. 
In the past two years, CBP 
enforcement has increased, too: 
In 2017, more than 500,000 
total enforcement actions were 
taken, including apprehensions 
and administrative arrests at 
U.S. points of entry, while over 
1,000,000 were taken in 2019. 
Bawardi said the rise in arrests 
and apprehensions at the U.S. 
border sparked conversations at 

universities nationwide about 
the best ways to protect students 
who may be worried about their 
immigration status. 
“Since the consolidation of 
government agencies and the 
erosion of civil liberties overall, 
the question now is, ‘what 
happened to our institutions?’” 
Bawardi said. “‘Are they still 
safeguarding the rights of their 
constituents? Do students’ rights 
still matter to the university on 
the administrative level?’ That, 
frankly, is not clear.”
Vikash Mehan, LSA senior 
and co-president of the Ann 
Arbor campus’ American Civil 
Liberties Union chapter, said 
it can often be difficult for 
universities like the three U-M 
campuses to offer support to 
undocumented students when 
federal funding is involved. 
“The University does express 
a lot of support for these groups, 
but part of the issue is federal 
funding and stuff, and we 
(the University) can’t really 
go against what the federal 
government 
wants,” 
Mehan 
said. “So, a lot of (the work) 
would have to be support of the 
community around Ann Arbor 
and around Dearborn, and them 
giving support to the immigrant 
populations.”
University Action 
In 2017, U-M President Mark 
Schlissel signed a “statement of 
support for Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals Program 
and 
our 
undocumented 
immigrant 
students” 
along 
with nearly 70 other university 
administrators 
across 
the 
country. The statement was 
drafted by Pomona College and 
called for universities to resist 
Trump’s attempts to terminate 
the DACA program. According 

to a 2017 statement from U-M 
Public Affairs, the three U-M 
campuses also comply with a 
2011 DHS policy that defines 
universities 
as 
“sensitive 
locations.” Essentially, this 
means 
enforcement 
actions 
require special permission from 
DHS leadership before being 
carried out. 
Maria 
Ibarra-Frayre, 
a 
volunteer with the Washtenaw 
Interfaith 
Coalition 
for 
Immigrant Rights and a School 
of Social Work alum, said even 
with these protections many 
undocumented students live in 
fear of CBP or ICE being present 
on campus. 
“Regardless 
of 
whether 
or not they called to set up 
operations or to do a training, 
for undocumented students and 
undocumented people, the threat 
of ICE in general or border patrol 
being present is scary enough,” 
Ibarra-Frayre said. “So, they see 
a border patrol car or an ICE 
car around, they’re not going to 
know what they’re doing. But 
that in and of itself causes a lot of 
fear.”
She added that the University’s 
public actions in support of 
undocumented 
students 
are 
important, but there is still more 
work to be done to make sure 
all students feel protected on 
campus.
“I really appreciate that the 
universities are taking a stand, 
and that they’re going public even 
when it’s a difficult thing to do,” 
Ibarra-Frayre said.. “Universities 
are so powerful, and the rest of 
the state really is looking to the 
University of Michigan to what is 
possible to do.”

while cutting costs. 
In 
the 
announcement, 
UHS noted this change was 
necessary “to keep the health 
service fee unchanged this 
year, 
despite 
significant 
increases 
in 
expenses, 
including providing greater 
financial support to other 
student life units.” 
Dr. Robert Ernst, executive 
director of UHS, said these 
billing changes come with an 
increased pressure to create 
multiple revenue streams for 
UHS. 
“In the context of being 
asked to stay creative stay 
innovative and hold increases 
in the health service fees to 
a minimum, the easiest first 
step is to let the hospital bill 
what they’re doing, instead of 
us just paying for them,” Ernst 

said. 
Before this policy change, 
more than half of UHS’ nearly 
$300,000 
yearly 
laboratory 
testing 
costs 
were 
from 
student STI checks, according 
to Ernst.
According 
to 
the 
UHS 
website, 
for 
students 
who 
have Blue Cross Blue Shield, 
Medicare or any University 
of Michigan funded health 
care, bills should be covered. 
If a student has another type 
of insurance, coverage is not 
guaranteed. 
“It is ultimately the decision 
of your insurance company 
whether they will pay UHS,” 
the website reads. “If we do 
not 
receive 
payment 
from 
your insurance company, UHS 
will bill you and you will be 
responsible for payment.”
UHS 
wants 
to 
help 
uninsured students enroll in 
Medicaid and has also released 
a new health insurance plan, 
Ernst said.

CSG Vice President Isabelle 
Blanchard, an LSA senior, said 
CSG is planning on releasing 
a list of other options for STI 
testing, as well as a survey to 
monitor student concerns.
“CSG has already begun 
communicating with students 
about this change, and plans to 
release a survey to the student 
body to learn more about how 
this might affect the student 
experience,” Blanchard wrote 
to The Daily in an email. 
Alternative 
options 
for 
inexpensive 
STI 
checks 
include Planned Parenthood 
or the Washtenaw County’s 
Sexual 
Health 
Services 
building. Neither offer free 
testing. 
Some 
students 
have 
expressed 
concerns 
about 
STI testing showing up on 
their parents’ EOB. A student 
who has requested to remain 
anonymous for this article 
said in a strict religious family 
such as her own, there would 

be 
consequences 
for 
her 
education if her parents knew 
she was tested.
“Billing 
such 
tests 
to 
personal insurance removes 
that sense of safety a student 
gets 
from 
knowing 
their 
parents don’t know about their 
sex life,” she said. “Personally, 
I come from a highly orthodox 
family and if they knew I 
was having sex I would face 
pretty serious repercussions, 
the lowest of which would be 
pulling me out of school.”
If students are concerned 
about their parents seeing the 
EOB for an STI test on the 
insurance bill, they should 
consider buying their own 
health insurance, Ernst said.
“If a student is seeking 
confidential 
healthcare 
that they don’t want their 
parents to be made aware of, 
they 
might 
be 
individuals 
who might be interested in 
exploring their own personal 
student 
health 
insurance 

plan,” Ernst said. “At just over 
$1,700 a year, it might actually 
be more affordable for them 
than the extra cost to stay on 
their parents insurance, and 
then it would be certainly very 
confidential.” 
Parental disapproval is just 
one of the reasons students are 
worried about this new policy. 
Betsy Stubbs, Art & Design 
junior and SAPAC volunteer, 
said having free STI checks on 
a college campus eliminated 
barriers to getting tested.
“People are already very 
reluctant to get tested for 
STIs,” Stubbs said. “There 
is such a negative stigma 
surrounding 
STIs 
that 
it 
makes it very difficult to work 
up the courage to get tested. 
U-M was taking steps in the 
right 
directions 
allowing 
testing to be free because that 
eliminated one more barrier. 
Handing out condoms can’t be 
the only thing this University 
tries 
to 
protect 
student’s 

sexual health.” 
Rackham 
student 
Kaley 
Makino, who is passionate 
about sexual health advocacy, 
said this also adds financial 
barriers to students in addition 
to the stigmatization. 
“Privatizing sexual health 
screenings will undoubtedly 
lower affordability and access 
to students who may or may 
not have personal insurance 
willing to cover the cost of 
the testing,” Makino said. 
“This will further discourage 
students to get STI screened 
because they will likely have 
to pay some portion out-of-
pocket, which is an added 
expense many cannot afford.” 
All students interviewed for 
this article stated they were 
unaware these billing changes 
included the loss of STI tests 
previously-covered 
in 
their 
tuition. 
The 
anonymous 
student said she heard of the 
change from a reddit thread.

I would say the 
overarching 
mission really is 
to make sure that 
the University is 
responding fairly 
and appropriately 
to concerns that 
exist.

The 
second 
enrollment 
period covers Jan. 1, 2020 to 
Aug. 23, 2020, while the third 
enrollment extends from May 
1, 2020 to Aug. 23, 2020. Each 
enrollment period charges a 
different fee. 
Burchett said the new plan 
includes the benefits from 
the AETNA plan — such as 
emergency room visits and an 
annual vision exam — but for a 
better price. 
“What we said is ‘we want 
the same plan that we had last 
year,’ in other words with the 
same benefits, but we were 
looking for a better price, and 
so Blue Care Network just 
did it for less than the other 
insurance 
companies 
did,” 
Burchett said.
Under 
the 
new 
plan, 
students must use a Blue Care 
Network provider in the state 
of Michigan, and a Blue Cross 
provider outside the state, 
in order to be considered 
“in-network.” 
Essentially, 
if 
the student wants to receive 
coverage 
in 
the 
state 
of 
Michigan they must use a 
Blue Care Network provider 
but outside of Michigan must 
use Blue Cross. Still, Burchett 
doesn’t anticipate this will 
cause 
problems, 
since 
the 
company is nationwide and a 
big company.
The Blue Care Network full-
year plan for domestic students 

is $1,709 annually with a $100 
deductible for in-network and 
out-of-network care, whereas 
the AETNA plan charged a 
$2,084 annual fee with a $500 
deductible.
However, 
the 
new 
plan 
could prove more expensive if a 
student required costly medical 
care. For example, under the 
new plan, the out-of-pocket 
maximum a student might pay 
would be $3,500 in-network 
and 
$7,000 
out-of-network. 
The maximum was $2,500 
under the AETNA plan. 
Engineering senior Gabriel 
Shlain uses the University-
sponsored 
student 
health 
insurance. 
Shlain 
said 
the 
new plan works for him as a 
relatively healthy person, but it 
may hurt those with expensive 
medical conditions. 
“I assume that there are 
definitely 
other 
students 
here 
who 
have, 
probably 
outstanding medical conditions 
that I’m not aware of, and they 
might need more personalized 
care and more costly care that 
might cost more now with 
this plan, but for me that’s just 
not the case,” Shlain said. “So 
unless something actually bad 
were to happen to me or I run 
into a serious health condition, 
I prefer the plan right now, 
because for at least a yearly 
physical, testing, bloodwork, it 
gets the job done.”
Benefits of the new plan 
include 
prescription 
drug 
coverage, clinic visits, mental 
health, annual vision exam, 

hospitalization, 
emergency 
room visits, ambulance service, 
dental coverage and more. 
According to the Domestic 
Student 
Health 
Insurance 
Plan website, the plan was 
negotiated by a Central Student 
Government 
student 
health 
insurance committee. 
CSG President Ben Gerstein 
said the plan serves as a good 
option for students and is 
excited to see how the plan 
works 
for 
international 
students, specifically.
“I think the plan seems like 
a good option for students 
in terms of what it offers,” 
Gerstein said. “It covers dental, 
which I know is something 
UHS is excited about. I believe 
the significant change was 
that they put the international 
student plan and the domestic 
student plan under the same 
umbrella. I’m interested to see 
what the effects of that will be, 
and obviously communicate 
with international students to 
make sure they feel the UHS 
plan adequately covers their 
needs.”
Around 
1,600 
students 
were enrolled in the new plan 
as of Aug. 27, while around 
2,900 were enrolled in the 
AETNA plan during the third 
enrollment period, previously. 
Burchett said she expects the 
number of students enrolled 
in the new plan to increase 
throughout the year as more 
students hear about it or age 
out of their parents’ insurance 
plan.

S

en. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 
must fancy himself a true 
patriot, and for good reason. 
In recent years, our Senate Majority 
Leader — the longest-serving senator 
in Kentucky history — claims he has 
been safeguarding the American 
people 
from 
the 
Democratic 
Party’s dangerously leftist agenda. 
Speaking in his buttery Kentucky 
drawl, McConnell boasted about his 
reputation on “The Ingraham Angle” 
this past June.
“I am indeed the grim reaper 
when it comes to the socialist 
agenda,” McConnell said, referencing 
the plan Democrats would apparently 
force upon the country. As it turns 
out, McConnell’s “grim reaper” 
moniker suits him for more than just 
his success in stifling Democrats’ 
“socialism”— he’s also the grim 
reaper for the American blood on his 
hands.
In the early afternoon of Aug. 3, 
America learned of a mass shooting, 
this time in El Paso, Texas, that cut 
22 lives short. McConnell took to 
Twitter to console those impacted 
by the massacre. “The entire nation 
is horrified by today’s senseless 
violence in El Paso,” he observed, 
saying, “Elaine’s and my prayers 
go out to the victims of this terrible 
violence, their families and friends, 
and the brave first responders who 
charged into harm’s way.” In the early 
morning of Aug. 4, another shooting 
occurred in Dayton, Ohio, claiming 
10 more lives. The following morning, 
McConnell tweeted that news of the 
event was “sickening to learn.” I have 
no doubt that McConnell, like every 
American, was deeply disturbed 
by the shootings. But his words of 
comfort are wholly irreconcilable 
with his actions as Senate Majority 
Leader, which makes his condolences 
insulting and void of merit.
As part of his crusade against 
the Democrats’ ostensibly insidious 
leftism, McConnell has been a 
stubborn advocate of gun rights, a 
legacy that he is quite proud of. When 
the Republican Party took control 
of the Senate in the 2014 midterms, 
McConnell became Senate Majority 
Leader. His ascension to that office 
has granted him incredible influence 
as to the flow of legislation and debate 
in the Senate, and during his five-year 

tenure, he has obstinately obstructed 
meaningful debate on gun control 
legislation.
McConnell’s intransigence on 
the matter accords him additional 
blame for America’s gun problem. 
While support for gun control 
soars nationwide — 86 percent of 
Americans, according to a 2015 Gallup 
poll, support universal background 
checks 
for 
gun 
purchases 
— 
McConnell has methodically slowed 
the Senate’s consideration of gun 
reform. As recent as February, the 
House of Representatives passed the 
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 
2019, a bill that mandates background 
checks for the exchange of firearms 
between private parties, by a vote of 
240-190. For six months, McConnell 
has dragged his feet when it comes 
to allowing a Senate debate and 
vote on the bill. In doing so, he has 
disrespected the will of 86 percent of 
the country.
As 
the 
leader 
of 
Senate 
Republicans, it’s easy to target 
McConnell for the unforgivable 
lack of progress on gun control. 
But McConnell’s attitude is also 
emblematic of a more general trend 
that has limited gun control success 
— the GOP’s zealous defense of the 
Second Amendment, which seems 
to have become a cornerstone of the 
party’s platform.
The 
Republican 
Party’s 
obsession with guns has become 
more entrenched with time. While 
conservative 
Americans 
have 
long championed an originalist 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Second 
Amendment, refusal to entertain 
gun reform is a relatively new 
development. As the Nixon tapes 
indicate, President Richard Nixon, 
who left the White House in 1974, 
privately 
floated 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
wholesale 
handgun ban. Nearly 50 years later, 
the thought of a Republican president 
vocalizing such a measure seems 
absurd. Evidently, the problem is not 
just McConnell’s present chokehold 
of the Senate, but the culmination of a 
decades-long process of conservative 
radicalization. 
While 
Republican 
resolve 
to defend against “gun-grabbing 
liberals” has solidified with time, 
the terms in which conservatives 
justify their firing position have 

remained consistent. The argument, 
as presented by McConnell & Co., 
is typically twofold, and involves an 
invocation of the Second Amendment 
and the assertion that gun reform 
can’t 
prevent 
mass 
shootings. 
Arguing over the intent of the Second 
Amendment with supporters of gun 
rights is a fruitless exercise. While the 
language of the amendment arguably 
only permits gun possession for “a 
well regulated militia,” conservatives 
almost universally interpret the 
Second Amendment as guaranteeing 
gun 
rights 
for 
individuals. 
Fortunately for proponents of guns, 
jurisprudence has historically sided 
with the right, which is why appeals 
to the Constitution have not been 
the primary strategy of gun control 
advocates. 
Conservatives understand that 
ink on parchment — even if that 
parchment is the Constitution — 
isn’t enough rhetorical ammunition 
for the current state of debate. 
Consequently, we frequently hear 
the line that gun control wouldn’t 
have prevented Dayton, or El Paso, 
or Las Vegas or Parkland. We know, 
however, that the perpetrators of the 
August massacres purchased their 
weapons legally. The shooters, of 
course, may have gone through illicit 
channels to obtain their firearms if 
they could not legally buy them. But 
the facts remain that compared to 
other developed nations, the United 
States suffers from gun violence on 
an unmatched scale, and developed 
countries that have implemented 
gun control measures have seen 
incredible declines in gun violence. 
Partisan talking points aside, 
it’s hard to dismiss public opinion 
at a time when over 61 percent 
of Americans want stricter laws 
governing the sale of firearms as 
of October 2018. Maybe the GOP 
will recognize the way the wind 
is blowing and choose to entertain 
dialogue ahead of the 2020 elections. 
Maybe Republicans will double down 
on their current stance. I’d bet on the 
former, at least to a degree, because 
the polling is clear: More and more 
Americans can no longer accept 
Mitch McConnell’s prayers.

CHERYN HONG | COLUMN

Student life is already falling short with freshmen
A

s the summer wound 
down and freshmen 
prepared 
for 
their 
first 
semester 
as 
college 
students, the class of 2023 
received 
an 
e-mail 
from 
E. 
Royster 
Harper, 
vice 
president for Student Life.
The message contained 
information on the online 
modules all new students 
are 
required 
to 
take: 
Sexual Assault Prevention 
for 
Undergraduates 
and 
AlcoholEdu 
for 
College. 
What I found interesting was 
how neutral I felt towards 
the modules. It has come to 
my attention that preparing 
for college comes hand in 
hand with the beginning 
of 
conversations 
between 
parents and students about 
alcohol abuse and sexual 
assault. 
Both 
are 
serious 
and 
important 
topics 
of 
conversation. However, most 
of my peers have pushed the 
modules aside, intending to 
take them as late as they can. 
Many don’t seem to consider 
the topics as pressing or 
important, 
but 
simply 
another task to check off the 
to-do list. 
“I 
think 
most 
people 
already know at least some 
of the logistics behind sexual 
assault,” LSA freshman Tyler 
Traskos said. “But I talked 
to other guys from different 
colleges who also had to 
do the modules, and we 
all agree that they present 
the information in a way 
which makes people want 
to get through it as fast as 
possible, rather than paying 
attention.” 
There are numerous other 
universities, 
along 
with 
U-M, that have reached out 
to students to participate 
in 
the 
courses, 
however, 
there remains a common 
feeling of disinterest among 
freshmen. While I greatly 
appreciate the openness of 
conversation and how many 
schools across the nation are 
participating, my skepticism 
raises questions about the 
effectiveness of the program.
The module is a lecture-
style 
presentation 
with 
interactive 
features 
and 
videos that admittedly grab 
one’s 
attention. 
However, 

after completing the exam, I 
was unsure of what I should 
be taking away from the 
lesson. 
Even with my knowledge, 
I took the module somewhat 
distractedly. 
In 
addition 
to the repetitive questions 
on the exams and verbose 
facts from federal and state 
law, there was something 
missing. 

There are tactics such 
as not wearing a ponytail 
while 
walking 
alone 
at 
night, using keys as claws 
in-between your knuckles, 
or never leaving your drink 
unattended 
— 
all 
simple 
yet effective strategies for 
students the modules could 
promote. It isn’t enough to be 
aware of the proper labels of 
assault or where to find help 
at the University, but to make 
the issues more relatable and 
applicable to the real world. 
The module was informative, 
but it didn’t reach the full 
potential it could have. 
Along with the modules, 
freshmen 
are 
required 
to 
attend 
two 
in-person 
sessions, each being two-
hour discussions, with regard 
to sexual health and healthy 
relationships. 
Though 
the 
class of 2023 has yet to absorb 
all 
the 
information 
the 
University is attempting to 
share, it seems as though the 
discussions set a standard for 
other University of Michigan 
students 
to 
discuss 
these 
issues. 
“The in-person sessions 
were 
really 
important 
conversations to have, and 
it brought everyone to the 
same page,” LSA sophomore 
Liliana 
Arida-Moody 
said. 
“Overall, I think it’s a good 
way to establish a healthier 
culture with a big student 
population.”

It is imperative to note 
the privilege I had in high 
school being able to receive 
these lessons, as well as the 
personal conversations I had 
with teachers and mentors 
who were aware of assault 
and drug abuse. While it 
isn’t perfect, the University 
community is actively giving 
students a chance to properly 
educate themselves. Another 
reason why these modules 
are falling short is because 
the students are not fully 
harnessing what they learn. 
It is the responsibility of 
the freshmen to take the 
information and use it the 
best they can.
It’s an unfortunate reality 
that the most effective way to 
learn the true consequences 
of alcohol abuse or sexual 
assault 
is 
experience. 
No 
one understands the grim 
truth of alcohol abuse and 
sexual assault unless affected 
personally, which is why I feel 
the need to push universities 
and even high schools to 
educate students before they 
reach a point of helplessness. 
The United States still 
faces 
a 
high 
number 
of 
unreported 
sexual 
assault 
incidents and alcohol abuse, 
especially in college settings. 
However, 
many 
families 
and 
educational 
programs 
do not have these necessary 
conversations 
until 
the 
students’ first year of college. 
How we educate students 
reflects upon our society 
and how we discuss an issue 
that 
has 
long 
been 
kept 
underground. 
My hope is that, along 
with 
the 
online 
modules, 
in-person sessions and overall 
conversation about alcohol 
and sexual assault, there will 
be a spark for an even larger 
and 
deeper 
conversation 
among University students. 
This should be the starting 
point for students to actively 
seek 
better 
solutions 
and speak up about their 
experiences so the academic 
community can become more 
honest, progressive and find

A

s 
students 
at 
the 
University of Michigan, 
we are all at some 
form of a crossroads in our lives. 
College is a time when adolescents 
transform into productive, adult 
members of society, often residing 
away from family for the first 
time and becoming financially 
independent. We explore new 
ideas and develop stances that 
shape our viewpoints for the rest 
of our lives.
Among 
these 
experiences, 
there is another junction that 
often gets lost in the mix — a 
biological one. After spending 
our formative years growing 
physically and psychologically, 
we are now in our late teens 
and early twenties and at the 
beginning of the physical and 
cognitive primes of our lives. It 
is within the next decade that 
most of us will be in the window 
of time in which our minds 
and bodies have capacities to 
do more extraordinary things 
than they ever have and ever 
will again. Following this, many 
aspects of this potential will 
creep into a decline that continues 
for the remainder of our lifetimes. 
The question is: Should we make 
it a priority to seize this moment 
and capitalize on our maximum 
biological potential while the 
window is still open?
For a long time, my answer 
to this question was “yes.” I 
have always been a proponent 
for seeing one’s potential to 
actuality. As such, it made sense 
to me that squandering time 
during one’s twenties that could 
be used for self-betterment was 
a waste — how else is one to see 
what they are truly capable of 
physically and mentally?
The 
physical 
aspect 
of 
this notion was significantly 
influenced by elite athletes’ 
career trajectories. A classic 
example is Michael Phelps. Phelps, 
considered by many as the greatest 
male swimmer and Olympian ever, 
broke the world record when he 
won eight gold medals in Beijing at 
just 23. He would never do it again, 
and at the 2012 Olympics, 19 year 
old Kristof Milak broke the then-
27 year old’s record. The fact that 
Phelps reclaimed the gold medal in 

the 200 meter butterfly and earned 
four more at the 2016 Olympics, 
at 31, makes him an anomaly as 
male Olympic gold medalists in 
swimming events are, on average, 
about 21 years old.
Cognitive performance with 
respect to age has been the 
subject of ongoing discourse in 
psychology. Processing multiple 
tasks such as digit symbol coding, 
digit span, and vocabulary, peaks at 
about 20 years of age. While short-
term memory was measured in 
different ways at each age, short term 
memory typically peaks roughly 
three times over someone’s life: 
once at around 10 years old, the next 
at 30, and the last at 50.
A decline in creativity, while less 
rigorously studied, is still evident. 
U2, one of the most financially 
successful bands of all time, has 
been actively releasing new music 
for 40 years. For their first 20 
years, U2 underwent dramatic 
shifts in musical style several 
times without any drop-off in their 
massive popularity, a testament 
to their ability to remain flexible. 
However, the band’s last five albums, 
starting with 2000’s All That You 
Can’t Leave Behind, have been less 
well-received, indicating perhaps 
that they have lost their zeal for 
reinventing themselves at this stage 
of their lives.
Since I have started college, I have 
thought about examples such as 
these, and many others, frequently, 
telling myself that it is important 
to seize the opportunities in early 
adulthood to see what my full 
potential is as a person before 
my biological clock sends me 
over my peak and the windows 
of my physical and cognitive 
maximums 
close. 
However, 
trying 
to 
maximize 
every 
aspect of oneself as a person 
is a daunting and impossible 
prospect, and at the end of my 
sophomore year, I felt that I had 
achieved little toward pursuing 
this ideal.
Over this past summer, I 
realized that statements such as 
those above are implicative of an 
erroneous assumption that our life 
“peaks” must be realized during our 
biological peaks. We are still humans 
capable of doing incredible things 
into mid and late adulthood.

The majority of people reach their 
professional peaks well after their 
biological peaks. The average age at 
inauguration for presidents of the 
United States is 55 years; Donald 
Trump was inaugurated at age 70, 
and top Democratic presidential 
candidates 
Joseph 
Biden, 
Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth 
Warren are 76, 77 and 70 
years old respectively. Part of 
this is likely due to the value 
of 
experience. 
While 
fluid 
intelligence may reach its apex 
in early adulthood, crystallized 
intelligence peaks at the middle 
of a lifespan. 
From this perspective, we 
can actually turn back to sports 
and learn from athletes in skill-
centered disciplines. LeBron 
James, who has arguably been 
the world’s best basketball 
player for the past decade, was 
the most dominant player in 
the 2018 NBA playoffs at age 
33, despite having had lost a 
step physically, largely because the 
diverse skill set he honed during 
his career enabled him to pick 
apart defenses in endless ways. 
Both Serena and Venus Williams 
continue to be world-class tennis 
threats. Tom Brady won his sixth 
Super Bowl at age 41. Tiger Woods 
won the Masters at 43. Their body of 
experience allows them to keep their 
ceiling of performance extremely 
high.
Though I am still a proponent 
of people trying to leverage 
their potential while they are 
young, my idea of “maximum 
potential” 
has 
changed. 
At 
the end of the day, many of us 
have a vague idea of what our 
personal or professional life 
goals are — some of us may have 
a bucket list of things we’d like 
to do over the course of our 
lives. My current viewpoint 
is that achieving these goals 
throughout one’s life, rather 
than solely while young, and 
living a fulfilling life are the 
ultimate signs of fully-realized 
human potential. Perhaps this 
isn’t breaking news to most, but 
it has changed the way in which 
I view my personal trajectory.

What does maximizing our potential entail?

In the spirit of Welcome 

Week, 
Festifall 
and 
all 

things post-Labor-Day, The 
Michigan Daily Film section 
has 
written 
a 
collection 

of 
blurbs 
celebrating 
our 

favorite 
“Openings” 
to 

movies. Here’s to another year 
of learning, changing, trying, 
failing, 
crying, 
smiling, 

passing, 
movie-watching 

and 
(most 
importantly) 

a-best-picture-awarded-

“Moonrise Kingdom”
The best opening movie 

sequences 
all 
have 
the 

same type of premise. The 
filmmaker must set the stage, 
acclimate 
their 
audience 

to the wit or severity or 
drama or grief they’ll be 
tasked with dealing with 
and lay out the stakes of the 
world they’ve built. Writer/
director 
Damien 
Chazelle 

(“Whiplash”) calls this his 
overture (even when he’s 
not making a musical), his 
chance to create a microcosm 
of the drama that will soon 
unfold onscreen.

Wes Anderson’s “Moonrise 

Kingdom” 
is 
my 
favorite 

example of this. The writer/
director splits his movie’s 
first five minutes into two 
parts of the same whole: First, 
beginning the movie with 
a drawn out title sequence 
to the music of Benjamin 
Britten’s “A Young Person’s 
Guide 
to 
the 
Orchestra,” 

meanwhile 
sliding 
his 

camera 
laterally 
and 

horizontally to capture the 
impossibly rectangle vistas 
of the family’s lighthouse 
home, and second, giving 
the audience a tour of the 
imaginary island where most 
of the movie takes place, the 
tour guide, an affable Bob 
Balaban, leading off with a 
resounding “Welcome to the 
Island of New Penzance.”

Anderson’s 
opening 

to 
“Moonrise 
Kingdom” 

accomplishes 
all 
the 

requirements of a Chazelle 
movie overture. From the 
very first shot, he bottles up 
the atmosphere of the film 
— picture-book, precocious 
energy 
— 
and 
gives 
the 

viewer a taste of what types 
of conflicts are to come. 
The unhappy household of 
Suzy Bishop is scanned up 
and down, left and right, as 
a thunderous storm rages 
outside. She’s seen holding a 
box of letters from her secret 
pen-pal, who she views as her 
escape from the prison of her 
parents. We pivot to a melody 
of strings as Balaban walks 
us around our home-for-
an-hour, framing with the 
announcement of a terrible 
storm the youthful love story 
whose drama will only be 
heightened by the arrival of 
the inclement weather.

Since 
the 
break-in 

sequence in “Bottle Rocket” 
and the chapel day-dream in 
“Rushmore” Anderson has 
had a knack for setting his 
movies off on the right foot. 
Honorable mention, also, to 
“The 
Royal 
Tenenbaum’s” 

16 minutes of go-nowhere 
narration that, despite being 
complete, 
blatant, 
young-

adult-novel-chapter-one 
exposition, feels absolutely 
riveting.

Film Editor

“Scream”
Drew 
Barrymore, 
Jiffy 

Pop and a landline. These 
are primary ingredients of 
the opening of “Scream,” and 
they work together all too 
well. The first 12 minutes of 

Wes Craven’s 1996 slasher 
satire compose one of the 
most jarring scenes I can 
recall from childhood and 
one of the most intricate 
horror sequences ever made. 
There’s so much to revere 
in both his camerawork and 
sound design. There’s an 
increasingly rapid pop of 
kernels on the kitchen stove 
(leading to their eventual 
explosion as Barrymore is 
evading 
her 
stalker); 
the 

gradual unnerving tilt of the 
camera from shot to shot, 
which 
eventually 
frames 

Barrymore in the corner of 
the screen, as if trapping her 
there; the uncannily creepy 
voicework of Roger Jackson 
as Ghostface, quizzing his 
victim on the history of 
movie 
serial 
killers. 
But 

it’s that last part that I find 
most interesting everytime I 
rewatch the scene: The subtle 
hints Craven lays even in 
those first few minutes that 
“Scream” will be a horror 
movie 
that 
mocks 
other 

horror movies. It’s probably 
the first great example of 
the style, but certainly not 
the last. Between “Cabin in 
the Woods” and “Get Out” 
and even 2019’s “Ready or 
Not,” there’s no shortage of 
current meta horror. But that 
first scene is a microcosm 
for everything that comes 
later, not just in the movie, 
but in the future of the entire 
genre.

ANISH TAMHANEY

Daily Arts Writer

The first 12 
minutes of 

Craven’s 1996 
slasher satire 
compose one of 
the most jarring 

scenes ... and 

one of the most 
intricate horror 
sequences ever 

made

Anderson’s 
opening to 
“Moonrise 
Kingdom” 

accomplishes all 
the requirements 

of a Chazelle 

movie overture

“If you send me 3 albums, I’ll 

send you 3 albums.”

This is how I came across 

Crushing by Julia Jacklin, the 
most transformative album of 
my summer. 

Crushing was revealed to me 

while I sat at a booth in UCLA’s 
dining hall among globs of 
angsty high schoolers in various 
summer camps. A life-changing 
friend I barely knew at the time 
offered to drown out the sound 
of pre-pubescents by listening 
to music. In that dining hall 
booth, Julia Jacklin hit me both 
like a brick wall and a bag of 
feathers, if that’s possible.

I didn’t fully acknowledge 

Crushing as a probable act of 
God until the lyrics of “Don’t 
Know How To Keep Loving 
You” popped out at me on 
my commute to work. The 
repetitiveness of “I wanna” 
and “I want” throughout the 
first verse, paired with the 
steady two-line chorus and 
the haunting descriptions of 
falling out of love, described 
the specificities of a plague I 

thought could only infect me. 
Jacklin softly and painfully 
coos out: “What if I cleaned 
up? What if I worked on my 
skin? I could scrub until I am 
red, hot, weak & thin.” This 
specific sequence of words had 
me hitting my steering wheel 
continuously, screaming “oh 
LORD this is it.”

After this moment, I was 

launched into a “daydreaming 
with 
Julia 
Jacklin 
on 
my 

morning 
commute” 
phase. 

Crushing is a steady album 

that crescendos sparingly but 
powerfully, so my car often felt 
like an enormous, beautiful, 
empty cruise ship that only 
I resided in, rocking up and 
down with the waves until the 
occasional crushing, nervous 
system-altering 
swell 
would 

come along.

The commute to a nine-to-

five ended, but Jacklin never 
did for me. She’s the release 
of screaming in a parking lot, 
creating the perfect amount 
of 
noise 
around 
abusive 

relationships, 
devastating 

breakups, 
feminism, 
bodily 

autonomy, losing and letting 
go. She perfectly encases all of 
these themes inside her lovely 
alt-rock, Dolly Parton-esque 
sound, and best of all: She’s 
intimately tied to my life-
shattering best friend, who 
physically came and went with 
the summer.

So 
what 
I’m 
listening 

to on repeat is the angelic 
voice of Julia Jacklin, who is 
synonymous 
with 
summer, 

my best friend, the movies we 
watched and the fancy drinks 
we had, my new outlook on 
the female body, losing people 
left and right and the glorious 
taxation of relationships.

Synchronicity with Jacklin

MAKE THE GRADE

THE RUNWELL BACKPACK

BROCKHAMPTON has been 

in turmoil since former vocalist 
Ameer Vann’s departure from 
the group in May 2018. Kevin 
Abstract has been the most 
public in wrangling his emotions: 
From 
melancholic 
voicemails 

cryptically 
released 
on 
his 

website to running on a treadmill 
for 10 hours on livestream in 
front of his childhood home, his 
feelings have been palpable.

All the turmoil, public 

and private, has coalesced in 
BROCKHAMPTON’s most 
off-your-chest album. In an 
interview with GQ, Abstract 
explained, “Something we’re 
doing is putting those type of 
lyrics — like this shit is trash, 
anxiety, depression, all that 
stuff — taking those type of 
lyrics and putting it on a song 
that a bunch of people could dance 
to or something.” That speaks 
to the album’s sound as a whole: 
The lyrics are rarely anything 
but burnt-out or bittersweet. The 
concept comes to life very clearly 
on tracks like the single “BOY 
BYE,” where the boys speak on 
depression and trauma with the 
slickest flows over a vibrant beat.

Interestingly, 
the 
band 

explained during an interview 
with Beats 1 Radio that they 
recorded over 100 songs for 
the album and just picked their 
favorites. But that’s not what it 
sounds like in the music — in fact, 
GINGER is more thematically 
coherent 
than 
any 
previous 

BROCKHAMPTON 
project. 

The band’s simultaneous distress 
and 
confidence 
is 
perfectly 

encapsulated over the course of 
the album.

The boy band known for 

starting their albums with intense 
bangers subverted expectations 
with opening track “NO HALO,” 

a beautiful but subdued track 
filled with depression, despair 
and hopelessness. The second 
track, “SUGAR,” is as sweet-
sounding as its title suggests. It’s 
similarly subdued but packed 
with smooth verses and vocal 
harmonies for a feeling of warm 
nostalgia. Ryan Beatty, a frequent 
BROCKHAMPTON collaborator, 
makes the track with his soulful 
contributions on the hook. It’s 
an Usher-like mid-2000s R&B 
revival, and may be one of the 
band’s best songs yet.

Faith as a way to cope with 

struggle is an overt theme 
throughout 
the 
album. 
The 

whole band has upped their 
writing game with in-your-face 
downtrodden lyrics like, “And 
we all out lookin’ for, lookin’ for 
God so we never see it in ourself” 
from Dom on “SUGAR.” Pent-up 
frustration from the band peaks 
on 
“DEARLY 
DEPARTED,” 

filled with lyrical mourning, 
prayer and cries for help. It’s the 
most emotionally charged track 
on the record in which the boys 
speak openly about ex-member 
Ameer Vann. After following the 
situation and seeing the public 
fallout, I felt my own heart sink 
when Kevin sang, “What’s the 
point of havin’ a best friend if 
you end up losin’ him?” Dom 
McLennon, most infamous for his 
anger towards Ameer, ends the 
track with fury screaming “You 
could talk to God / I don’t wanna 
hear, 
motherfucker” 
before 

dropping the mic.

While BROCKHAMPTON has 

a track record for hardcore hits, 
their slappers in GINGER don’t 
land nearly as well as their softer-
sounding songs. The synths in 
the beginning of “ST. PERCY” 
is reminiscent of the iconic 
opening track to SATURATION, 
“HEAT,” and makes me want to 
listen to that instead. “I BEEN 
BORN AGAIN” is a fun track 
— it’s exciting in the context of 
the band’s “rebirth” and new 
direction, uniting all six vocalists 
— it’s just a little all over the place, 
like many tracks on their previous 
album iridescence.

There are also a few 

stumbles at the end of 
GINGER. Joba, who has 
upped his game all across the 
record, delivers one of his 
strongest performances ever 
on the eerie and ghostly “BIG 
BOY,” but the rest of the song 
doesn’t hold up. The mellow, 
repetitive deliveries from 
Kevin and Joba get stale very 
quickly on “LOVE ME FOR 

LIFE” despite the interesting and 
unique instrumental. The album 
still manages to finish strong with 
“VICTOR ROBERTS,” on which 
BROCKHAMPTON-affiliate and 
first-time vocalist Victor Roberts 
tells a heart-wrenching story of 
his troubled family upbringing. 
The song is a perfect closer for 
an album in which emotionally 
driven lyricism is at the forefront.

GINGER, like the album’s 

namesake, is a palate cleanser for 
BROCKHAMPTON. It’s a step 
forward for the band as they’ve 
struggled to find the footing they 
had with their music in 2017. 
This is the album they needed to 
make: A controlled expression of 
depression, a fresh encapsulation 
of distress. Some tracks don’t land 
as well as others, but even within 
those, the impeccable and dark 
songwriting still shines. They’re 
overcoming the trials they’ve 
faced as a band and making it clear 
that the BROCKHAMPTON boys 
are here to stay.

Cleansing with GINGER

ALBUM REVIEW

DYLAN YONO
Daily Arts Writer

The 
often-repeated 
injunction 

“write what you know” always 
seemed tautological to me — can it 
be otherwise? Everything comes 
from somewhere. It’s unsurprising, 
though, that there are a lot of novels 
about writers and their social circles, 
and often about the process of writing 
a novel. As a professional writer, a 
certain kind of intellectual sociality 
is probably easier to render in detail 
than nearly anything else. So-called 
“metafiction” is only at the extreme 
end of this.

One recent, and very good, 

example of a novel about novelists 
is “Early Work” by Andrew Martin. 
The story follows the would-be 
writer Peter Cunningham, who is 
working on a vaguely-defined book 
after dropping out of Yale’s graduate 
program, and lives with with his 
medical-school-student 
girlfriend 

Julia near the University of Virginia. 
Peter teaches writing at a women’s 
prison, a job which leaves him with 
incredible amounts of free time that 
he seems to use mostly for visiting 
friends and occasionally writing, 
seemingly without success: “As 
anyone who’s ever pretended to be a 
writer knows, ‘the book’ was really a 
handy metaphor for tinkering with 
hundreds of Word documents that 
bore a vague thematic resemblance 
to each other, but would never cohere 
into the, what, saga of ice and fire that 
they were imagining.” His charmed, 
stagnant life is interrupted by his 
sudden attraction to another young, 
somewhat 
directionless 
writer 

named Leslie, and the two soon 
embark on an affair. 

It’s a novel that could only 

be written by someone firmly 
entrenched within the milieu of 
its 
characters 
— 
overeducated, 

self-conscious 
creative 
types 
— 

and probably is only readable by 
members of the same set. The then 
two-couple dynamic of the plot 

is a shameless cliche, something 
Martin freely acknowledges. The 
book’s interest lies in its incredibly 
engaging voice. Its humor is mostly 
subtle, communicated on the level of 
language. Martin always finds the 
exact right word to nudge a line of 
dialogue into absurdity, always finds 
a way to communicate trepidation, 
desire or quiet anger with the 
balance of a sentence. For example, 
here’s Leslie describing seeing a 
film with a boyfriend: “She usually 
loved boring movies, loved to sit and 
stare at people’s faces as they stared 
at other things, even when there 
was a second-tier jam band making 
supposedly joyful noise through the 
wall.” Like many of the novel’s scraps 
of inner monologue, this sentence 
holds many competing thoughts and 
feelings together in a precipitous 
balance — the film is simultaneously 
boring and enjoyable, the jam band 
is simultaneously annoying, but 
could be heard as joyful. The book 
is saturated with references, nearly 
always with attendant ambivalence. 
One gets the sense that there are 
multiple layers of cultural scripts 
operating in most of the conversations 
in the book. Leslie again, on Future’s 
Dirty Sprite 2: “‘Yeah, I’m pretty into 
monotonous drug rap right now,’ she 
said. ‘I mean, like everybody. I guess 
it’s the usual racist thing, where white 
people like it because it takes their 
worst suspicions about minorities 
and confirms them in lurid and 
entertaining ways?” To which Peter 
responds, “Yeah, that’s why I like it. 
Racist reasons mostly. I’m not thrilled 
about the misogyny, though.” 

This frequently-quoted segment 

of dialogue is only one example of 
a curious discursive form Martin 
plays with in a million different 
ways. Everyone in the book has 
been educated into a sense of what 
constitutes good art, a necessarily 
exclusionary concept: this makes 
their 
interactions 
with 
most 

everything else slightly tortuous at 
best. Leslie listening to DS2 isn’t the 
same thing as an ironic appropriation 
— it’s a genuine sense of shame, 

tempered by an equally-weighted 
awareness of how absurd this shame 
is. The characters renounce and love 
in the same breath, arriving back at a 
wordier version of where they started.

Martin 
exercises 
a 
similar 

ambivalence about the affair that 
structures the book. Peter does not 
try to rationalize his split affection 
for Julia and Leslie, and thankfully 
doesn’t make a caricature out of 
Julia. In fact, she comes across as 
quite personable in addition to her 
talents (she’s also a published poet, 
implicitly a more productive writer 
than Peter). There is very little actual 
parody in the book. Peter knows that 
he’s making a stupid decision that will 
hurt someone he loves, and he does it 
anyway. In a similar anecdote, Leslie, 
living in New York City, has a stable 
relationship with Katie, a dramaturge 
who “showers as much as once a day,” 
and feels irrationally stifled by Katie’s 
clipped togetherness — not because 
of anything Katie does, necessarily, 
but because Leslie doesn’t feel like 
she has space to be irresponsible in 
it. Right before Leslie abandons her 
relationship with Katie, she thinks 
to herself: “Why was there nothing 
goddamn mysterious about (Katie), 
like there was about everyone else? 
Why were even her adventures so 
cramped and circumscribed?”

This is to say that Peter and Leslie 

are both seeking their freedom, every 
relationship a provisional step on 
the way to self-realization. Martin is 
compassionate toward this impulse, 
even while showing how ugly the 
fallout from it can be. The novel 
ultimately suggests that people can 
create their own fates, even as it also 
documents lucidly the vagueness of 
the disaffections that compel us to 
act, and the unforeseen consequences 
of these actions. The book is forgiving 
and optimistic about human nature, 
and this might be why it’s overall very 
pleasant to read despite the literal 
events in the plot often being rather 
ugly. For Martin, self-creation is what 
ties together romantic relationships 
and art-making — two noble pursuits 
that we can’t help but fail at.

When 
“Good 
Eats” 
premiered in 1999, it was 
clear that it is as much a 
recipe as it is a show. Each 
episode is a deep culinary 
dive into the origins, history 
and science of a particular 
dish. There is prepwork 
involved, 
research 
and 
ingredients to amass. Alton 
Brown maneuvers through 
his kitchen with rapid-
fire narration and snappy 
angles. The episodes are 
seasoned to taste with low-
budget skits. Twenty years 
later, for “Good Eats: The 
Return,” the recipe clearly 
hasn’t changed, but that 
doesn’t make it any less 
enjoyable.
The world of culinary 
television is weighed down 
by the humdrum of fast-
paced cooking challenges, 
wasteful 
extravaganzas 
and unnecessarily dramatic 
contests. But “Good Eats” 
has always been a shining 
needle 
in 
that 
rough, 
crowded 
haystack. 
A 
departure from his chaotic 
persona 
in 
“Cutthroat 
Kitchen,” 
Brown’s 
dedication to simplicity and 
effort is both refreshing 
and 
relaxing. 
In 
his 
kitchen, intensity is absent 
and replaced instead by 
advice, 
recommendations 
and guidance. Each dish 
has a history, a science and 
is given such an incredible 
amount of attention that 
Brown will often do the 

dish in multiple different 
ways. Waste is unheard 
of, as Brown uses as much 
of any ingredient as he 
can, focuses instead on 
multitools and encourages 
his viewers to save things 
they 
would 
normally 
discard for other, more 
experimental dishes.

In his return, Brown 
dons a cleaner, more chic 
look. His once bright and 
colorful kitchen is replaced 
instead 
with 
a 
clean 
and shiny neutral space 
that very much reflects 
modern taste. Even Brown 
himself 
looks 
incredibly 
different from the campy 
host 
who 
burst 
onto 
the screen in 1999, now 
exuding 
confidence 
and 
sophistication.
Much like every other 
installment, 
the 
“Good 
Eats: 
The 
Return” 
premiere focuses on an 
underappreciated 
dish 
chicken parmesan. With an 
almost scientific accuracy, 
Brown establishes exactly 
where this dish went wrong 
(it’s all mushy) and how 
they can fix it (it needs 
more crunch). First, Brown 
takes us to Manhattan, 
where he boldly proposes 
that 
all 
Americans 
are 
actually Italian-Americans 
by virtue of food culture, 
much to the dismay, I 
imagine, of actual Italian-
Americans. 
Before 
long, 
Brown dives into the actual 
dish, 
starting 
with 
the 
ingredients. 
To 
Brown, 

everything is important: 
the tomatoes, the garlic and 
even what kind of mortar 
and pestle to use.
What’s incredible about 
“Good Eats” is that the 
cooking 
is 
hardly 
the 
most 
important 
thing. 
Instead, it’s understanding 
how you’re cooking. For 
Brown, the technique and 
culinary science is both 
the 
beginning 
and 
the 
end. We’re taught why we 
spritz the chicken with 
water before pounding it 
out, to broil the pasta sauce 
alone before adding the 
chicken and to distribute 
everything evenly. Brown 
even whips it up “fancy 
restaurant style” in case 
you wanted your chicken 
parm to look prettier.
 Eats: The Return” may 
not be different, but that 
doesn’t 
mean 
it’s 
stale. 
In many ways, it feels 
like 
coming 
back 
to 
a 
relative’s 
house, 
except 
you haven’t seen them in 
a while and everything’s 
been 
updated. 
It’s 
still 
the same “Good Eats,” it’s 
just been modernized. At 
its heart, “Good Eats” is 
still 
about 
appreciation, 
not just for food, but for 
the work that goes into 
it. It is a celebration of 
learning, 
understanding 
and 
practice. 
“Good 
Eats” doesn’t pander to 
dramatizations or tension. 
It is as it is — relaxing, 
thorough and, above all, 
good eats.

First look at Gattis’ offense offers mixed bag

Two Michigan offensive staffers 
paced briskly back and forth from 
the sideline to the edge of the field. 
There were hand motions and wild 
gesticulations, some yelling and al-
ternative forms of communication. 
Behind him, another dutiful staffer 
held signs — a Nike swoosh coating 
one side. From the press box, Josh 
Gattis looked on, stoic, conducting 
his orchestra from a perch.
Moments later, senior quarterback 
Shea Patterson handed the ball to 
sophomore running back Christian 
Turner. A gain of two yards. Then 
onto the next play.
Gattis was hired to be Michigan’s 
offensive coordinator exactly 
234 days ago. Much of the time 
since has been spent speculating 
as to what his offense might look 
like. There were expectations of 

improvement from a unit that 
plainly needed overhauling. There 
were well-publicized promises of 
“speed in space”. There were rave 
reviews from those in and around 
the program.
Saturday, finally, it was all there for 
the public to see in the Wolverines’ 
40-21 season-opening win over 
Middle Tennessee State.
The early returns? Some good, 
some bad and plenty to digest.
“Lot of good things,” said Mich-
igan coach Jim Harbaugh. “Still, 
we know, we’ve seen in practice 
that we can operate cleaner. That’s 
what we’re all going to strive for 
this week in practice. As I said 
at first, this is a new offense. I 
thought for a first time out, it was 
good. Could it be better? Yeah, 
sure. And that’s what we’ll be 
striving for.”
The night began, though, with a 
thud back to reality. On the Wol-
verines’ first play from scrimmage, 

Patterson scooted for 11 yards, be-
fore fumbling the ball away. MTSU 
recovered and scored a touchdown 
three plays later.
“Obviously didn’t get off to a great 
start,” Patterson said. “I gotta take 
care of the football. A win’s a win, 
but I think everybody in that locker 
room knows that we didn’t live up 
to our standard.”
Overall, though, the statistics bear 
an overwhelmingly positive per-
formance. The offense totaled 453 
yards, with 220 coming through 
the air and 233 on the ground. 
Eight different players carried the 
ball on runs and nine different 
receivers caught a pass. The speed 
was there. At times, the space 
came, too.
Patterson followed up his initial 
miscue up with five consecutive 
scoring drives, including a 36-yard 
strike to junior receiver Tarik 
Black. Black featured heavily on 
the next series, too, serving as the 

vessel for two consecutive run-
pass options (RPOs) — looks that 
are integral to Gattis’ offense. That 
possession ended with a 28-yard 
touchdown catch by Nico Collins 
on a picture-perfect post route. 
That led to a gaudy first half for 
Patterson, who was 16-for-25 for 
197 yards and three touchdowns in 
the opening frame.
Gattis took his entire treasure trove 
and threw it out there. At times, it 
hummed. Others left more to be 
desired.
“I mentioned to someone earlier, 
I don’t know how many different 
plays we ran in the game, but it was 
a lot,” Harbaugh said. “A lot of the 
offense that we’ve been practicing 
we ran. It was all facets of it — 
play-action pass, drop-back, the 
RPOs, inside zones, outside zones. 
It was a good amount of offense 
that got called tonight.”
All of this, fan hysteria aside, 
should be expected from such a 

drastic offensive overhaul in its 
debut. Flipping the switch from 
a run-first, pro-style offense to a 
modern, spread scheme will come 
with its share of growing pains. 
After the game, Harbaugh lament-
ed some of the penalties and 
miscommunication that clouded 
Saturday’s performance. Michi-
gan completed just one of its first 
eight passes in the second half, and 
had just 23 passing yards after the 
break. The two-quarterback looks 
and newfangled option sets often 
appeared disjointed or ill-con-
ceived.
But the framework is there. And 
any struggles, Patterson crucially 
deduced after the game, does not 
stem from any identity crisis.
“Overall, pretty darn good for the 
first time seeing a new offense,” 
Harbaugh said. “It’s come so far 
from where it was in the spring to 
now. Keep trying to build on it.”

SportsTuesday Column: At 
QB, quantity isn’t quality
T

here’s an old football plati-
tude that if you have two 
quarterbacks, you actually 
have none.
It’s one of those folksy cliches 
you hear when 
the Miami 
Dolphins are 
sifting through 
the pile of rub-
ble to decide 
whether Gus 
Frerotte or 
Sage Rosenfels 
should be the 
one to lead 
them to a 4-12 
season.
As it pertains to this Michigan 
football team and its quarterback 
room, that sentiment couldn’t be 
further off. The Wolverines have 
two capable quarterbacks in Shea 
Patterson and Dylan McCaffrey. 
They are a good football team, 
with aspirations to be a great one. 
There are (or should be) no ques-
tions about which of the two is the 
starter.
In the quarterback room, the 
lone question left to answer — how 
do you best maximize both of 
them? — is one of immense luxury. 
This group is a far cry from the 
John O’Korn/Wilton Speight/
Brandon Peters wilderness that 
came to define the early Jim 
Harbaugh years. But that ques-
tion is still one that seems like it 
will continue to linger, and in the 
modern era of college football, it’s a 
question that must be treated with 
caution.
Still, while Michigan’s quar-
terback depth is one of this team’s 
biggest strengths, that doesn’t jus-
tify using it on some milquetoast 
gimmicks. This is not a position in 
which an excess of quantity on the 
field generally translates to quality. 
Frankly, if there is a single impor-
tant play this season in which 
Patterson isn’t under center, some-
thing has gone wrong or someone 
has erred.
Saturday’s display was a clear 

example of how excess creativ-
ity could backfire. McCaffrey’s 
first appearance against Middle 
Tennessee came in the middle 
of the first quarter, lined up as a 
wide receiver. He came in motion 
while Patterson faked the handoff 
and eventually gave the ball to 
Christian Turner for two yards. 
Moments later, Michigan was 
flagged for an illegal substitution, 
with confusion swirling. The very 
next play, McCaffrey came in 
motion, while Patterson once again 
faked the handoff. McCaffrey then 
caught an ill-conceived screen pass 
and took two body blows on a one-
yard gain.
The drive stalled. The Wolver-
ines punted. Tensions heightened.
Later on, with the game well 
in-hand, McCaffrey led two drives 
as the quarterback. Harbaugh said 
after the game that Patterson had 
been banged up and that he want-
ed to give McCaffrey some zone 
read looks in order to avoid exac-
erbating any nicks and bruises. 
He scored on a 6-yard read-option 
rush. In the context of the game, it 
made sense.
Harbaugh has consistently 
stated his desire to play both quar-
terbacks, starting at Big Ten Media 
Days in mid-July. Doing so, the 
thinking goes, keeps both (mostly 
McCaffrey) engaged and ready, 
while also using the skill set he 
possesses. 
Some of this reasoning is sound. 
McCaffrey is faster and therefore a 

better weapon in option looks. Giv-
ing Patterson a breather here and 
there could help ensure his health 
when it matters most. Getting 
McCaffrey ample in-game looks 
could help appease any qualms 
he has about sitting second on 
the depth chart for another year, 
avoiding the disgruntled trans-
fer that has become so prevalent 
throughout college football.
And if all goes according to plan, 
McCaffrey will be atop the depth 
chart a year from now. From all 
we’ve seen, he has the potential 
to be a high-caliber Big Ten quar-
terback. For now, he’s vital depth. 
Soon enough, he’ll matter far more.
None of that is to degrade 
McCaffrey’s value to this team 
right now. Newsflash: Football is 
violent. People get hurt. Things 
do not go according to plan. If Pat-
terson — Michigan fans, knock 
on wood — were to go down, as 
Speight did in 2016 and 2017, as 
Peters did in 2017 and as hundreds 
of other football players do every 
year, this team has the great for-
tune of not folding up shop and 
calling it a year. 
That, more than any trick plays 
or fancy packages, forced gim-
micks or out-of-rhythm rotations, 
is the value Dylan McCaffrey 
brings to this team. It should stay 
that way.

Patterson shows off ability 
in Josh Gattis’ new scheme

After eight months of hype and 
hysteria, it was only expected that 
Michigan’s new offense would 
be a motif when Shea Patterson 
spoke to the media following the 
opener. Nobody, though, expected 
the senior quarterback’s response 
to be a repeated shake of the head, 
followed by, “I gotta take care of 
the football.”
Patterson 
fumbled 
on 
the 
season’s first play from scrimmage 
Saturday night, handing Middle 
Tennessee 
State 
the 
ball 
in 
Michigan territory, and soon, a 
7-0 lead. He fumbled again later, 
pouncing on top of the ball before 
things could repeat themselves. 
The Blue Raiders’ lead didn’t 
hold up and never had much of a 
chance of doing so — in the end, 
the Wolverines won 40-21 without 
much consternation — but it never 
strayed far from Patterson’s mind 
as he took questions afterwards.
Asked about the offense in 
general terms, the first words 
out of Patterson’s mouth were, “I 
gotta take care of the football.” 
After a follow up, he finished 
complimenting his receivers, then 
said, “We gotta play better.” After 
a question regarding Michigan’s 
use of two quarterbacks at a time, 
he replied, “I don’t know how to 
answer that, but yeah. I got the ball 
in my hands every single play, and I 
gotta take care of it.” As he talked, 
his lips barely moved. He did not 
bear the demeanor of someone 
paying lip service to improvement.
“A win’s a win,” Patterson said, 
“but I think everybody in that 
locker room knows that we didn’t 
live up to our standards.”
Patterson, 
in 
reality, 
was 
his own worst public relations 
manager on a night where, by and 
large, he played just fine and maybe 
even better than that. Patterson 
completed 17 of 29 passes for 203 
yards with three touchdowns, no 
interceptions and a 151.6 rating, 

which is squarely in the middle 
of the pack during his time at 
Michigan.
This is different, because it 
came against a clearly inferior 
opponent, it was Patterson’s first 
time in Josh Gattis’ offense and it 
wasn’t the beatdown that everyone 
from Michigan fans to Vegas 
oddsmakers thought it would be.
Still, 
he 
orchestrated 
the 
Wolverines’ best moment of the 
game, a four-play, 67-yard drive in 
just over a minute at the start of 
the second quarter. He pulled the 
ball and found Tarik Black on two 
straight run-pass options, then 
found Nico Collins on a well-placed 
throw to the end zone, putting it 
where only Collins could get it.
Two 
of 
Patterson’s 
three 
touchdown passes, Jim Harbaugh 
said, came from plays where 
Patterson got to the line of 
scrimmage and checked Michigan 
into something different. That kind 
of quick-strike decision making is 
what Patterson can bring to this 
offense, and it’s what an offense 
predicated 
on 
no-huddle 
and 
option football requires from its 
quarterback. 
“He was outstanding in that 
regard,” Harbaugh said.
As he himself was more than 
happy to say, Patterson had his 
issues, ball security chief among 
them. According to Harbaugh, 
he was also evaluated for an 

undisclosed injury at halftime, 
which likely helps explain why he 
threw the ball 25 times in the first 
30 minutes and four in the latter 30 
minutes.
But when you’re playing in a new 
offense and the biggest concern 
after the first game is ball security, 
that’s a good problem to have. It’s 
not a commentary on the offense, 
nor his fit in it, that Patterson 
fumbled twice. Harbaugh pointed 
out that the quarterbacks handle 
the ball a lot in this system, but ball 
security hasn’t been a major issue 
for Patterson in the past and likely 
won’t be in the future.
What 
matters 
is 
Patterson 
making the right decisions at the 
line of scrimmage. What matters 
is his comfortability in playing fast 
and putting the defense in conflict. 
What matters is his doing all that 
while being the same effective 
passer he was last season. And 
for now, what matters is that he 
checked all of those boxes on 
Saturday.
In all of his morosity at the 
podium, Patterson offered one 
moment of clarity.
“I think we definitely know who 
we are. From Day One, I think we 
knew who we were right when the 
guys came in, coach Gattis came in. 
We worked so hard all spring and 
all summer. 
“It’s just a matter of taking care 
of the little things.”

Shea Patterson threw for 203 yards in Michigan’s win on Saturday.

Behind new offense, Michigan bests Middle Tennessee, 40-21

As the crowd filed toward the 
exits, the clock ticking toward 
zero and the score meandering 
toward a 40-21 Michigan win, 
the Wolverines’ slow start — 
and the fleeting doubt over 
Saturday night’s result that 
came with it — had faded into 
memory.
The game’s early uneasy 
feeling started before kickoff, 
when junior receiver Donovan 
Peoples-Jones was dressed in 
street clothes and a walking 
boot — an early blow to new 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis’ promise of a high-flying 
spread offense built around 
the Wolverines’ slew of star 
receivers.
And when a Shea Patterson 
fumble ended Michigan’s first 
drive on the first play from 
scrimmage, doubt continued to 
creep into Michigan Stadium. 
Even if the Wolverines would 
still stroll to an easy win against 
an overmatched opponent, the 
grand reveal of Gattis’ offense 

was temporarily on hold.
The dominant, make-you-
read-it-twice scoreline No. 7 
Michigan (1-0) might have been 
hoping for against MTSU (0-1) 
never came — two turnovers in 
its own half and inconsistency 
on the offensive line made sure 
of that. But the diversity of 
Gattis’ offense shown through 
plenty 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ five-
touchdown day.
“I was pleased, 
really, with the 
way (the offense) 
operated,” 
said 
head coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “… A 
lot of the offense 
that we’ve been 
practicing, 
we 
ran. All facets of 
it — the play-action pass, the 
drop back, the RPOs, the inside 
zones, the outside zones.”
Tarik Black — part of a 
talented, 
but 
often 
under-
utilized junior receiving trio 
featuring 
himself, 
Peoples-
Jones and Nico Collins — put the 
Wolverines on top by streaking 

down the field, unguarded on a 
go route as he allowed himself 
to collapse beneath the ball for 
his first touchdown since the 
first game of his career two 
injury-riddled years ago.
Two minutes into the second 
quarter, his stat line stood at 
four receptions for 80 yards 
and a touchdown — better than 
or equal to his 
totals from a 
year ago on all 
three 
counts. 
Black was also 
the 
leading 
beneficiary 
of 
Michigan’s 
run-pass 
option, one of 
Gattis’ 
most 
anticipated 
offseason 
introductions.
“He’s gone through a lot and 
when healthy, we have probably 
one of the best receiving corps 
in the country,” said fifth-
year senior linebacker Jordan 
Glasgow. “So seeing an athlete 
and a receiver as good as 
him be able to come back out 

here, make plays and get that 
touchdown. … I’m just happy 
that (he) got back out there, 
able to make plays.”

With Black and Collins at 
full throttle, bursting the top 
off the MTSU defense at ease, 
Saturday’s game had already 
served its intended purpose 
by the time Collins capped off 
Michigan’s fifth drive with a 
leaping touchdown catch.
The Wolverines’ lead stood 
at just 17-7, but any hope 
for 
a 
MTSU 
miracle 
faded 
into the night 
with 
junior 
cornerback 
Ambry Thomas 
coming up with 
an interception 
and recovering 
a 
fumble 
on 
consecutive 
drives.
On 
the 
other side of the ball, Gattis’ 
proclaimed staples of downfield 
passing and RPOs manifested 
themselves 
in 
a 
first 
half 
that looked unlike anything 
Michigan 
showcased 
last 
season — to the point, Patterson 
attempted 25 passes in the first 
half, matching his full-game 
average from a year ago.
The dream-like domination 
many envisioned when Gattis 

arrived only shone through 
in spurts, hence the 19-point 
victory in a game that closed 
with 
a 
36-point 
spread. 
But 
while 
Patterson’s 
first 
words postgame included the 
phrase 
“I 
think 
everybody 
in that locker room knows 
that we didn’t live up to our 
standard,” Harbaugh offered 
a more balanced 
perspective.
“This offense, 
they 
handle 
the ball a lot,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“It’s a lot — the 
snap, the ride, 
the decision, the 
pull and throw. 
So actually it’s 
quite 
good. 
Obviously, we’re 
not taking a deep, long bow. We 
know we can play better. That’s 
an area we’ve got to get better 
at, be more efficient at.”
As 
for 
that 
early 
doubt 
over the Wolverines’ nascent 
offensive identity?
“I think we definitely know 
who we are,” Patterson said. 
“From day one, I think we knew 
who we were, right when Gattis 
came in.”

Zach Charbonnet shows off 
potential in pass protection

The 
question 
was 
about 
quarterbacks, so naturally, Jim 
Harbaugh wanted to talk about 
running backs.
The Michigan coach had 
already 
heaped 
praise 
on 
freshman 
Zach 
Charbonnet 
following 
Michigan’s 
win 
Saturday night, 
and before that, 
anointed 
him 
the starter in 
the 
backfield. 
The 
action 
spoke 
louder 
than the words 
could anyway.
None of that 
praise 
was 
ill-conceived 
— 
after 
an 
offseason 
of 
questions 
surrounding 
the 
position, 
Charbonnet 
gave 
Michigan 
some answers. He attacked 
the holes that opened up for 
90 yards on eight carries, 
including 
a 
41-yard 
gallop 
during 
which 
he 
blasted 
through the line, got into the 
open field and picked up a 
handful of extra yards once 
Middle 
Tennessee 
State’s 
defense caught up. 
To 
some 
extent, 
that’s 
expected. A top-50 recruit is 
supposed to solve problems on 
the depth chart, or at least make 
himself heard. But perhaps 
not this soon, and perhaps not 
this emphatically. And for all 
he showed running the ball, 
it was his pass protection that 
Harbaugh heaped praise on 
Monday.
“Zach Charbonnet had nine 
pickups in protection, which, 
I don’t think we’ve had a back 
get nine pickups in a protection 
since we’ve been here, one 
single back,” Harbaugh said. 
“And to be 100 percent, nine 

out of nine, that’s like, wow. 
That’s really good.”
Charbonnet’s 
rushing 
ability is important. But pass 
protection is arguably more 
integral to his playing time. 
It’s how Tru Wilson got on the 
field as a walk-on last year, 
and it’s how Charbonnet could 
cement his place as the starter 
this year.
“He just was 
handling 
it, 
with not even 
a 
misstep,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“So, 
it’s 
rare. 
That’s rare. I’ve 
had pro guys that 
don’t understand 
the protections 
as well as the 
freshman 
back 
in this game.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 
keeps it simple under, Sean 
McKeon said. They’re playing 
up-tempo, 
looking 
to 
the 
sideline for play calls via 
signals. That does not mean it’s 
easy, especially for a freshman. 
“You gotta scan the whole 
field, basically, to figure out 
who’s blitzing,” said senior 
tight 
end 
Sean 
McKeon, 
explaining the job. “Gotta see 
the offensive line 
calls and points, 
so it’s definitely 
not 
easy 
as 
a 
freshman 
running back.”
McKeon 
said 
that 
Charbonnet’s 
focus 
towards 
football reminds 
him of defensive 
lineman 
Ben 
Mason, which in Schembechler 
Hall is akin to saying that your 
local congressman’s speaking 
ability reminds you of Barack 
Obama. 
Mason’s 
voice 
is 
loud and direct. He is often 

portrayed as every stereotype 
of a football player, holding a 
deep appreciation for football 
and seemingly nothing else.
It’s 
easy 
to 
understand 
why Harbaugh might like it 
if Charbonnet has the same 
disposition.
“It’s just, it’s eye-catching 
with Zach Charbonnet cause it 
just looks like it comes easy to 
him,” Harbaugh said. “It’s like, 
difficult math equations that 
guys just get. And so, it catches 
your attention.”
None of this is to say 
Charbonnet 
will 
suddenly 
become Michigan’s bell cow. 
Christian Turner and Wilson 
competed for the starting job 
throughout camp. Turner got 
the most carries of the three 
on Saturday. Harbaugh liked 
what he saw, highlighting a 
tightrope run on the boundary 
after the game, then again on 
Monday.
Eight 
different 
players 
carried 
the 
ball 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
and 
even 
accounting 
for 
the 
inevitabilities of a blowout, 
it’s safe to say that Harbaugh 
and Gattis are comfortable 
with their depth. They flashed 
an 
array 
of 
option 
looks, 
jet 
sweeps 
and 
a 
two-
quarterback 
package 
that 
probably 
needed 
work. Even if 
Charbonnet 
is the starter, 
that 
title 
is 
largely 
ceremonial.
But 
that 
reality doesn’t change what 
Charbonnet showed everyone 
on Saturday.
“He’s locked in,” McKeon 
said. “He’s really impressive 
for a freshman.”

Hayes creates questions at OT

Eight seconds into the first 
game of his college career, Ryan 
Hayes faced his first test.
Khalil 
Brooks, 
Middle 
Tennessee State’s star linebacker, 
was barreling into the backfield, 
straight toward Shea Patterson’s 
blindside. Looking off a head fake 
from defensive end Malik Manciel, 
the left tackle dropped back, 
stared down the charging Brooks 
and nearly discarded him to the 
turf, allowing Patterson to escape 
the pocket.
Sixty minutes later, Hayes was 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh’s 
offensive player of the game.
“He graded out right there 
with Ben Bredeson and Cesar 
(Ruiz) and Mike Onwenu, which 
I thought was really impressive,” 
Harbaugh said. “Ben was a little 
higher, but considering it was 
Ryan’s first start, first game, seeing 
him and the effort that he gave 
and his ability. He made some fine 
blocks, was good with his hands.”
Hayes, a redshirt freshman 
converted 
from 
tight 
end, 
ascended the depth chart after 
a strong offseason in the weight 
room. “To see what he looked 
like from his first day to Saturday, 
it’s like night and day,” redshirt 

freshman 
right 
tackle 
Jalen 
Mayfield said Monday.
Despite his strong offseason, 
Hayes came into Saturday as 
the clear backup, stuck behind 
fifth-year senior Jon Runyan at 
left tackle until an injury held 
Runyan out of the season-opener. 
Across a line anchored by three 
returning starters on the interior, 
Mayfield saw his first career start 
at right tackle through similar 
circumstances, 
breaking 
into 
the starting lineup after Andrew 
Steuber’s preseason ACL tear.
Now, on the back of Hayes’ 
performance, a starting offensive 
line that seemed to be set once 
Steuber went down has been 
cast into doubt again. Monday 
afternoon, 
Harbaugh 
called 
Runyan 
“arguably 
our 
best 
lineman” 
but 
admitted 
the 
position is a meritocracy, also 
noting Hayes’ ability to slot in at 
right tackle.
“Is there ability to compete at 
the other tackle spot? Sure, that 
opens up options if he’s come 
this far, he’s playing this well,” 
Harbaugh said. “Bodes well for 
the team.”
According 
to 
Harbaugh, 
Mayfield didn’t grade out as high 
as Hayes — hence the possibility 
Hayes could move to the right side 
of the line after Runyan returns. 

Mayfield got beat on a stunt for 
a third-quarter sack and seven 
minutes later to the outside for a 
quarterback hurry.
Still, he remained a steady 
presence on an offensive line 
that Harbaugh and Patterson 
repeatedly credited postgame.
“I think we did really well, first 
game, we were very prepared,” 
Mayfield said. “Extremely excited 
to see what we can do in the future, 
too. This was our first ever game 
as two redshirt freshmen playing 
at tackle so I think that’s really 
interesting that we did really well.”
But while it was the two 
redshirt freshmen who stood out 
considering the circumstances, 
Mayfield 
credited 
Michigan’s 
experience 
on 
the 
interior 
offensive line as the catalyst for 
his and Hayes’ performances 
Saturday night.
On the first play of the game, as 
Hayes threw Brooks to the turf, 
Mayfield handled his assignment 
with ease. The nerves, though, 
permeated until he remembered 
the advice Bredeson gave him 
before the game: play confident 
and have fun.
“The veteran group of guys in 
the middle just helped us a ton,” 
Mayfield said. “Cesar (Ruiz), Mike 
(Onwenu) and Ben (Bredeson). 
And I think sky’s the limit for us.”

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Freshman running back Zach Charbonnet was perfect in pass protection, going 9-for-9 against Middle Tennessee State.

Nine out of 
nine, that’s like, 
wow. That’s 
really good.

I’ve had pro 
guys that don’t 
understand the 
protections.

Thomas returns from colitis

Ambry Thomas knew the play 
Middle Tennessee was about 
to run. He’d seen it before, a 
couple plays earlier. He had a 
feeling he’d be the target.
Then, there he was, reacting, 
knowing he had to make a play. 
Blue 
Raiders’ 
quarterback 
Asher O’Hara threw the ball 
at him and he picked it off like 
there was nothing to it, halting 
Middle Tennessee’s momentum 
in the middle of the first quarter 
in an eventual 40-21 win.
Mere weeks ago, such a key 
play from the junior defensive 
back seemed nearly impossible. 
But Ambry Thomas had no 
regard for the odds.
On August 13, Thomas wasn’t 
even on the roster. That was 
when 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh explained that he’d 
been diagnosed with colitis and 
had missed all of fall camp — 
not practicing, not playing. He’d 
lost weight. He could only do 
conditioning and wasn’t cleared 
for full practice until last 
Sunday. A realistic expectation 
seemed like three weeks. Maybe 
four.
But Saturday, on the first 
defensive snap of the first game 
of the Michigan football team’s 
season, Thomas was out there 
on the field at cornerback. He 
was nails in coverage all night, 
finishing with an interception, 
a fumble recovery and a tackle 
for loss.
“It’s a little adversity I’ve 
fought through,” Thomas said. 
“And that’s all it was.”
While his teammates weren’t 
sure when exactly Thomas 
would return to play or if he’d 
start Saturday, Thomas knew 
from the time he was cleared 
that it wouldn’t be long before 
he was back making plays. All 
he needed was a few reps.
Going from conditioning only 
to starting at cornerback in just 

nine days would be a tall task 
for anyone, but Thomas — often 
heralded as one of the hardest-
working players on the team 
— was up for the challenge. He 
regained the weight, he got back 
into game shape and shook off 
the rust as best he could.
“I was worried about him 
going into the game week,” said 
fifth-year 
senior 
linebacker 
Jordan Glasgow. “I knew that 
he’s a great corner, obviously, as 
you can see from his play, but he 
had a lot less preparation than 
a lot of our opponents and us as 
a team. So to see him come out 
and make the plays that he did, 
it was just great to see.”
The next drive after Thomas’ 
interception, the Blue Raiders 
had the ball on third down at 
their own 21. Receiver Terelle 
West caught his pass, but 
sophomore defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson hit him and forced 
the ball out. Thomas fell on it.
Two plays later, Michigan 
was in the end zone and a 
stunningly close 10-point game 
had become the blowout it 
always seemed destined to be.
Thomas’ 
two 
big 
plays 

changed the complexion of 
the first quarter, but more 
than 
that, 
they 
marked 
a 
shift in mindset for a player 
who was understandably still 
apprehensive.
“That fumble recovery and 
pick, it built my confident 
thoughts in the game,” Thomas 
said. “My confidence wasn’t 
there because in practice, I ain’t 
really did enough of practicing, 
I had only been practicing, like 
really practicing, since Monday, 
full go practice. It just felt good 
to get my confidence up there.”
The rest of the game, Thomas 
was near untouchable and the 
confidence showed. More than 
a handful of plays against a 
subpar team, that was what 
Harbaugh 
noticed. 
Asked 
about Thomas in the postgame, 
Harbaugh noted the pick and 
the pounce, his coverage and 
his tackling, but the best part 
wasn’t any of that.
The best part was the smile 
that cracked across Thomas’ 
face, the adversity fading into 
the background as he settled 
back into his role, playing 
football and having fun.

‘M’ defense hoping to add polish

Asher O’Hara looked done for.
The 
Middle 
Tennessee 
quarterback was cornered by 
two defensive linemen and a 
linebacker. The play seemed sure 
to end in a sack. On third-and-3 
from Michigan’s 18-yard line, 
such a play would have likely 
forced the Blue 
Raiders into a 
field goal.
But 
somehow, none 
of 
Khaleke 
Hudson, 
Michael 
Dwumfour nor 
Kwity 
Paye 
could 
finish 
the 
tackle, 
and 
O’Hara 
scrambled all the way into the 
end zone.
After Middle Tennessee’s first 
drive, the score was a shocking 
7-0 in favor of the Blue Raiders.
Eventually, 
the 
Michigan 
football team cruised to an easy 
40-21 win. But that wasn’t how 
things were supposed to go for 

one of the top defenses in the 
country, facing the No. 101 team 
in preseason SP+, much less on 
the first drive.
“A win’s a win, and that’s 
great and everything,” said 
sophomore defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson after the game. “But 
it wasn’t how we wanted it.”
On one hand, the defense 
looked fine after that. Of the 
other two Middle 
Tennessee 
touchdowns, 
one came after a 
muffed punt in 
the 
Wolverines’ 
territory 
and 
the 
other 
was 
in garbage time 
against 
the 
second-string 
defense. But on 
the other hand, 
Michigan seemed to struggle 
after sudden changes and were 
plagued by fits of sloppy play all 
game.
In the second quarter after the 
muffed punt, the Blue Raiders 
drove down to the two-yard line. 
Then, sophomore defensive back 
Vincent Gray failed to pick up 
on a rub route in 
the end zone and 
gave the receiver 
too much space, 
leading to seven 
more 
points 
for 
Middle 
Tennessee. 
In 
the 
third 
quarter, 
senior 
defensive 
back 
Lavert 
Hill 
dropped 
what should have been an 
easy interception with no one 
standing between him and the 
end zone.
Against a team like the Blue 
Raiders, it’s easy to disregard 
such mistakes as growing pains. 
But when the Wolverines plays 
tougher teams — starting next 
week with Army — such messy 
play won’t cut it.

“Just 
eliminating 
self-
inflicted wounds, eliminating 
plays that harm us and give the 
offense advantages,” Gray said. 
“We want to eliminate all of 
that.”
But for a defense that lost a 
lot of production from last year 
to the NFL — linebacker Devin 
Bush Jr., defensive ends Rashan 
Gary and Chase Winovich and 
cornerback David Long — there 
were some positive signs.
Michigan 
finished 
with 
five tackles for loss and three 
sacks 
— 
including 
one 
by 
senior linebacker Josh Uche 
for 13 yards. Uche also forced 
a fumble that junior defensive 
back Ambry Thomas recovered, 
and Thomas also snagged an 
interception. The Wolverines 
picked up just three defensive 
penalties, and only one for more 
than five yards. That’s a good 
sign for a team that struggled 
with too many personal fouls in 
last year’s nonconference slate.
In 
his 
Monday 
press 
conference, 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim Harbaugh didn’t show any 
signs he was disappointed in 
his team’s performance and 
mentioned 
several 
of 
the 
team’s 
new 
defensive 
starters 
as 
standouts.
Perhaps 
it’s 
just a matter of 
shaking off the 
rust, of gelling 
together to avoid 
the same kind of 
lapses that led 
to the Blue Raiders’ first two 
touchdowns.
“(This defense is) a lot faster, 
we’re a lot stronger,” said junior 
safety Brad Hawkins. “But … 
we’ve got a lot of work to do. It’s 
week one, so definitely going 
forward, we’re definitely going 
to be improving. We definitely 
try to go out there and get 1 
percent better every day.”
