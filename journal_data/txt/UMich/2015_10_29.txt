Survey results 

from Change It Up! 
program illustrate 
progress in 2014

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Though violations related 

to alcohol, drugs and sexual 
misconduct increased in 2014 
over the previous year, data 
from the University’s Change 
It Up! workshop indicates that 
students feel more prepared to 
intervene in potentially harm-
ful situations after participating 
in the program.

According to survey data pro-

vided to The Michigan Daily by 
the Office of Student Life, the 
number of students who “very 
strongly agree” that they are 
motivated to intervene in harm-
ful situations rose by 24 percent 
after completing the Change It 
Up! program during the 2013-
2014 school year.

The survey is based on evalu-

ations of students’ propensity to 
intervene in harmful situations 
and responses to what they con-
sider harmful behavior. Those 
markers were measured before 
and after participating in the 
Change It Up! training, which 
is mandatory for first-year stu-
dents.

Overall, the total percentage 

of students who said they agree 
it is their business to intervene 
in harmful situations rose by 
93.89 percent following the 
workshop.

The University began imple-

menting Change It Up! pro-
grams last year for incoming 
freshman students.

Will Sherry, director of the 

Spectrum Center, said the pro-
gram is an introduction to help-
ing students identify a variety 
of harmful situations.A number 
of other programs throughout 
the year, including Relationship 
Remix and AlcoholEdu, also 
aim to teach first-year students

Austin Hatch 

discusses hardship,

When LSA sophomore Austin 

Hatch was 8 years old, his life 
changed completely. His father 
was piloting a plane intended to 
return the family home from a 

spring break trip when it stalled 
and crashed, killing his mother, 
younger brother and older sis-
ter. Then, in 2011, nine days after 
Hatch committed to play for the 
Michigan men’s basketball team, 
the 
unimaginable 
occurred: 

Hatch was the sole survivor of a 
second plane crash with his father 
as the pilot. The crash killed his 
father and stepmother.

“I was told there was a one in 

3.4 million chance in surviving a 
plane crash with at least one fatal-

ity,” he told a crowd in Hatcher 
Graduate Library on Wednesday. 
“That’s just one, so if you multi-
ply that against each other, I had 
a one in 11 quadrillion 560 trillion 
chance to survive.”

Hatch, along with several fac-

ulty members who faced their 
own challenging circumstances, 
shared his story of resilience 
Wednesday at Talk it UP!

Sponsored by the Newnan 

Academic Advising Center, Talk 
it UP! provided a forum for mem-

bers of the University community 
to reflect on the meaning of fail-
ure, success and endurance. The 
event featured a handful of short 
talks throughout the day.

Hatch told the audience he had 

to relearn to walk, talk, eat and 
live a normal life after the acci-
dent.

“I had basketball in my future, 

and I knew I had committed to 
Michigan,” he said. “I had some-
thing to work towards. All of

Discovery could 
advance treatment 
of lymphoma, breast 

and colon cancer

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

For years, scientists have been 

attempting to turn off Notch, a 
common cancer-causing gene, 
without much success. Now, Uni-
versity researchers may have dis-
covered a solution. 

A new study focused on Notch 

was led by Mark Chiang, assistant 
professor of internal medicine 
in the Medical School. Notch is 
heavily involved in T-cell leuke-
mia, a cancer commonly found 
in children, and is also involved 
in breast cancer, colon cancer, 
melanoma and other lymphomas. 
In the past, Chiang said, all drugs 
aimed to target Notch have been 
associated with serious and even 
life-threatening side effects. This 
motivated his team to find a safer 
way to target the gene.

Chiang said targeting Notch 

has been particularly difficult 

because the gene also has benefi-
cial functions within the body.

“It’s been very hard to target 

Notch because Notch not only has 
cancer causing-functions, but also 
important normal functions like 
keeping your intestines healthy 
or preventing you from getting 
cancers,” Chiang said. “If you 
simply block off Notch functions, 
yes you can kill some cancer cells, 
but then you have diarrhea — that 
can be life-threatening — and also 
second cancers.”

Chiang said the team wanted to 

investigate exactly what activates 
Notch’s cancer-causing activi-
ties. The team discovered a pro-
tein called Zmiz1, which sticks to 
Notch and turns on the cancer-
causing functions. When the pro-
tein was separated from Notch in 
mice, Chiang said mice did not 
experience side effects typically 
associated with Notch-inhibiting 
drugs.

“If we try to break the interac-

tion between or unstick Zmiz1 
from Notch, then we can actually 
cause tumor regression,” he said. 
“This may be a way to kill cancer 
cells but without the major toxici-
ties of Notch inhibitors.”

Study explores links 
between past drug 
experience, misuse 

down the road

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Adolescents who reported 

receiving a prescription from 
a doctor for a pain reliever are 

nearly 33 percent more likely to 
misuse pain relievers compared 
to those who never received 
a 
doctor-prescribed 
opioid, 

according to recent University 
study.

The subjects of the study’s 

focus group, 12th grade students, 
were asked to report whether or 
not a doctor prescribed them a 
pain reliever and if they used it. 
Researchers then provided the 
same students with follow-up 
questions between the ages of 19 

and 23 to see if the students who 
had been prescribed pain reliev-
ers were more likely to misuse 
them when they get older than 
those who never used an opioid.

Conducted by the University’s 

Institute for Social Research, 
the 
study 
also 
determined 

whether a student’s previous 
experience with drugs — includ-
ing drugs other than opioids, 
such as marijuana and alcohol — 
played a role in a student’s con-

HI: 53

LO: 35


you will go through something, 
but hopefully nothing as severe 
and traumatic as I have. But life 
isn’t pretty all the time, things 
happen. Set a goal, and work 
towards it and don’t let anything 
get in the way.”

Hatch played basketball for 

the University during his fresh-

man year, but left the team to 
focus on academics.

Denise Kozikowski, an LSA 

academic adviser and organizer 
of the event, said it was modeled 
after a Stanford University pro-
gram called “The Duck Stops 
Here.” 

“The Duck Syndrome is this 

idea that everyone on campus 
is walking around looking like 
this duck effortlessly gliding 
across the pond,” Kozikowski 
said. “Meanwhile, underneath 
the surface, the duck is paddling 
furiously and working so hard to 
stay afloat.”

Kozikowski said organizers 

wanted to create a space where 
students could hear about fail-
ure and others’ triumphs over 
tough problems.

“It’s an honest conversation, 

about it’s not always going to be 
easy and it’s not always going to 
be perfect, but it doesn’t mean 
that you’re not going to go where 
you want to go,” she said.

LSA junior Lauren Gilbert 

said she found Hatch’s speech 
inspiring, particularly because 
he has been through so much 
at such a young age. She agreed 
with Hatch’s view that any hur-
dle can be overcome.

“I think that any obstacle 

is just an obstacle and you can 
always get through it,” she said. 

English Prof. Anne Curzan, 

who delivered the event’s sec-
ond talk, discussed the impor-

tance of taking risks. She said 
life will take students places 
they would have never imag-
ined, and that’s OK.

“I think that when you see 

adults into their careers, it can 
look like we knew we were going 
to get here,” Curzan said. “It can 
gloss over all the messiness, all 
the indecision, all the panic, all 
the fear when we didn’t know 
what we were going to do and 
how the puzzle pieces would fit 
together.”

When Curzan was 22, she 

took a job teaching English in 
China. She told the audience 
how scary and hard the experi-
ence was for her.

“It wasn’t just about teach-

ing, it was about a new culture, 
a new language,” Curzan said. “I 
learned a ton about myself.”

Other 
speakers 
included 

Engineering 
Prof. 
Herbert 

Winful, Statistics Prof. Brenda 
Gunderson, Public Health Prof. 
Vic Strecher and Esrold Nurse, 
assistant dean in the Office of 
Student Academic Affairs.

Curzan advised students to 

take risks while they’re still 
young, gaining new experiences 
before settling down.

“Take some risks, and have 

some adventures, before you 
own furniture,” Curzan said. “It 
sounds funny, but life gets much 
more complicated once you own 
furniture.”

tion.

Though Sherry said the train-

ing spends time teaching students 
to identify microaggressions, or 
subtle instances of harm, stu-
dents also receive training on 
how to respond to situations 
involving intoxication and sexual 
misconduct.

Sherry 
said 
the 
program 

expanded this fall with pilot 
programs offered to a handful of 
incoming graduate programs.

“The Change It Up! program is 

an introduction to noticing prob-
lems and harm going on around 
you,” Sherry said. “We look to 
strengthen our connections to 
the other programs in the first-
year experience and that happen 
throughout the year.”

In 2014, reports of alcohol and 

drug violations and sexual mis-
conduct have risen over the previ-
ous year. In a report released by 
the Division of Public Safety and 
Security, on-campus liquor law 
arrests and citations totaled 254 
reports, compared to 202 in 2013. 
The 155 drug law arrests repre-
sented an increase over the previ-

ous year’s 114 reports.

Last year, the University’s 

Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center received 44 
reports of sexual misconduct, 
compared to 35 reports filed in 
2013.

Though the higher number of 

violations could be a result of a 
growing freshman class size and 
high overall enrollment, the pro-
portion of liquor law violations in 
residence halls per freshman class 
has increased from 2012-2014 — 
meaning reports are increasing 
regardless of class size.

Erik Wessel, director of the 

Office of Student Conflict Reso-
lution, said the rise in violations 
is due to a number of factors, but 
they do not imply bystander inter-
vention training is unsuccessful.

He pointed to national data 

released by the White House that 
showed bystander intervention 
education is a promising method 
to reduce harm, and programs 
like Change It Up! could encour-
age students to come forward and 
report instances of harm, like 
sexual assault.

“As we increase awareness 

across campus through programs 
like Change It Up! and Relation-
ship Remix, we are creating a 

culture and community that 
understands sexual violence has 
no place here,” Wessel said in an 
e-mail.

Sherry said Change It Up! is 

simply a foundation, and reduc-
ing violations and harm will take 
continued practice with bystand-
er intervention throughout a stu-
dent’s time at college.

“The goal of the program is not 

for students to leave and feel like 
after 90 minutes we are going to 
see a decrease in all of those vio-
lations,” he said. “That is going 
to take programming that exists 
beyond Change It Up!”

Sherry said part of Change It 

Up! training is teaching students 
that intervention in a situation 
is not simply a choice between 
doing something or doing noth-
ing, but can entail identify-
ing other ways to reduce harm. 
According to Wessel, a potential 
way to mitigate a harmful situ-
ation is to delegate the respon-
sibility to someone else, like law 
enforcement.

“Ultimately, it is important 

for students to hear from their 
peers that we have expectations 
for each other in this community 
and part of those expectations is 
to take action to reduce the poten-
tial for harm,” he said. “I believe 
that students here at Michigan 
are choosing to lean in to this call 
to action in increasing numbers.”

exhausted all other means of 
acquiring necessary goods and 
services.

“To reduce and understand 

corruption, we need to move 
away from this idea that state 
institutions and culture pro-
pel people — ordinary citizens 
— into corrupt exchanges, and 
instead consider their decision-
making processes and the alter-
natives that are available to 
them,” she said.

The central Asian republics 

of 
Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan 

and Uzbekistan served as ideal 
case studies to support her 
thesis, McMann said. She con-
ducted 266 interviews, numer-
ous surveys and lived with nine 
households between 1994 and 
2009 in the three republics. All 
three countries share a com-
mon history under Soviet rule, 
and engaged in varying levels 
of market reforms following the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The collapse greatly reduced 
the role of the government in 

their respective economies and 
accordingly saw an explosion in 
corruption.

McMann said the increase 

in corruption was fueled by the 
drawdown of centrally allocated 
resources under the old socialist 
system did not smoothly allow 
for a healthy private sector to 
emerge and replace the state-
centralized economy in these 
countries. Thus, these hollowed-
out governments would remain 
the biggest potential parties 
for citizens to receive credit or 
other resources.

“When you have a situation 

of a legacy of significant state 
economic intervention, and you 
introduce market reform but 
don’t create effective market-
building institutions, you end 
up with a situation of resource-
poor non-state actors,” she said.

McMann also emphasized 

that even though this corruption 
is generally viewed as “business 
as usual” in these societies, it is 
still considered unethical and 
therefore typically engaged in as 
a last resort.

Based on her interviews and 

research, McMann described a 

typical Kyrgyz farmer looking to 
expand their subsistence farm 
through credit. According to 
McMann, the farmer wouldn’t 
have enough collateral to secure 
a loan from a private bank, 
would find that their local reli-
gious institutions and extended 
family don’t have the resources 
to extend them informal credit 
and discover the local govern-
ment credit program has a long 
waiting list. Only when there 
are no other options, McMann 
said, would that farmer then 
choose to bribe a local official to 
get ahead of the waiting list for a 
government-sponsored loan.

McMann argued that her 

findings have important impli-
cations 
for 
anti-corruption 

efforts around the world, saying, 
“What my findings suggest is 
that it’s not sufficient just to tin-
ker with state institutions; you 
can’t just increase government 
officials’ income, for example, 
or create more sanctions for 
bad behavior, you also need to 
ask whether there are alterna-
tives so that citizens don’t have 
to engage in corruption to deal 
with economic challenges.”

tinued misuse of a prescription 
medication throughout their 
college years.

Richard Miech, professor at 

the University’s Institute for 
Social Research and the study’s 
lead author, said some of the 
students participating in the 
study had a lot of experience 
with drugs, and reported they 
had used marijuana. Others 
reported by 12th grade, they 
had had no experience at all 
with drugs.

“The surprising finding to 

come out of the study, is this 
effect that I found overall was 
concentrated among the drug-
naïve adolescents, the ones that 
had very little experience with 
drugs,” he said.

However, drug-naïve stu-

dents are about three times 
more likely to misuse drugs 
than those who have experi-
ence with other drugs. Accord-
ing to Miech, there is no effect 
among adolescents who had 
already had experience with 
drugs by 12th grade.

“What we speculate, is that 

the 
drug-naïve 
adolescents, 

when they’re taking a prescrip-
tion opioid, it’s really something 
quite different than they’ve 
ever 
experienced 
before,” 

Miech said. “It’s a safe expe-
rience, because it’s under the 
doctor’s guidance … For those 
adolescents, the pain reliev-
ers are really quite powerful 
and pleasurable. Whereas the 
adolescents who get a doctor’s 
prescription for an opioid who 
already have other drug experi-
ence, the whole opioid experi-
ence, relatively speaking, will 
not produce a big thrill.”

Miech said when a celeb-

rity dies from prescription 
drug overdose, the media often 
claims those individuals turned 
to harder drugs after using pre-
scription 
drugs 
legitimately 

prescribed by a doctor.

“They make it sound like pre-

scription drugs are a gateway 
to harder drugs like heroin,” 
he said. “What my findings 
show is that there are people 
that use prescription drugs and 
then go on to use heroin, but I 
don’t think their introduction 
to heroin was through prescrip-
tion drugs. They were already 
using all kinds of other drugs … 
I don’t think that was the cause 
of harder drug use.”

Though 
the study did not go 

into the developmental effects 
that accompany prescription 
pain medication abuse, Miech 
said at the ages of the students 
that were studied, the brain 
is still developing, making it 
more sensitive to these external 
drugs that enter the system.

Kennon Heard, professor of 

emergency medicine at the Uni-
versity of Colorado School of 
Medicine, also provided clini-
cal interpretation of the data for 
the study.

“We see many (Emergency 

Department) visits related to 
opioid abuse,” Heard wrote 
in an e-mail to The Michigan 
Daily. “The most common med-
ications are oxycodone, hydro-
codone and morphine. We also 

often see heroin use by patients 
who started abusing prescrip-
tion opioids and then moved to 
heroin because it is cheaper.”

Heard said the most common 

effects of opioid use are seda-
tion and respiratory depression.

“There is research suggest-

ing that early exposure to addic-
tive drugs increases the risk of 
abuse as an adult,” he added.

The research studied high 

school 
seniors 
until 
they 

reached age 23, which Heard 
said is an age where drug 
abuse tends to start. The rates 
of prescription drug abuse are 
higher in older adolescent age 
groups. However, he said the 
most extreme cases that result 
in needing medical attention in 
the emergency room are older 
than the age range considered 
in the study.

Though opioids are such a 

common concern because of 
abuse that can occur as a result, 
Heard said the medical field 
does not have alternatives to 
these medications.

“At this time opioids are the 

most effective pain medications 
we have,” Heard said. “Unfor-
tunately there are not great 
alternatives with less addic-
tive potential. Safe use requires 
thoughtful prescribing and con-
tinual reassessment for efficacy 
and safety.”

LSA junior Erin Dunne, 

co-director of the Student for 
Sensible Drug Policy organiza-
tion on campus, said the main 
goal of the organization is to 
promote harm reduction and 
inform the campus dialogue. 
She said members are ultimate-
ly interested in what is best for 
individuals, families and com-
munities.

Earlier this fall, SSPD hosted 

an event focused on opioids. 
The organization met with a 
Detroit emergency room phy-
sician who presented various 
concerns with opioid use in the 
United States. He also talked 
about methods to deal with 
opioid overdose, and ways peo-
ple can become hooked on the 
drugs.

Dunne pointed to a lack of 

specialized 
pain 
counseling 

in the United States, causing 
people to take painkillers when 
they do not necessarily need 
them and end up staying on 
them longer than they should.

Dunne mentioned a drug 

called Naloxone — commonly 
referred to as Narcan — which 
counteracts the effect of opioid 
overdose by blocking receptors 
in the body that opioids bind to 
and instigate an overdose.

The organization also sup-

ports proposals to extend medi-
cal amnesty policies to those 
suffering 
from 
prescription 

drug overdose.

“There’s still a lot of stigma 

on drug use and there is still 
a lot of fear around going to 
authorities and having to deal 
with someone who is suffering 
from overdose, especially if the 
other people around were using 
drugs themselves,” Dunne said. 
“We as an organization find 
this to be incredibly alarm-
ing. We want people to be able 
to seek the help they need for 
themselves and for their friends 
without these barriers.”

LSA junior Emily Liu, who 

worked on the project with 
Chiang, said a challenge of the 
research was targeting the can-
cerous signals of Notch without 
harming its other functions. She 
added that discovering the Zmiz1 
protein may be the key to ridding 
Notch of its cancer functions.

“My 
project 
focused 
on 

attempting to inhibit the coacti-
vator, Zmiz1, and to see the 
effects it has on physiology with 
mouse models,” she said. “We 
looked at the impact and toxic-
ity there. What we found was 
there was no significant effect 
on the intestinal toxicity when 
we inhibited the coactivator, 
suggesting that it is selective for 
the cancer signals of Notch.”

Chiang said making a drug 

applicable to humans is the most 
important next step. He plans to 
do so by creating a three-dimen-
sional image that will show how 
Zmiz1 sticks to Notch. This way, 
Chiang can discover how to sep-
arate the protein from the gene 
in humans. 

“Once we have this three-

dimensional image we can fig-
ure out ways to design a drug 

that could slip in between the 
two proteins and break the bind-
ing apart,” Chiang said. “That’s 
one of the major things we’re 
trying to figure out — how to get 
a three-dimensional image to 
help us make drugs to actually 
break this interaction.”

Though 
this 
research 
is 

primarily focused on Notch-
involved cancers, Chiang said 
it could have implications for 
treating other cancers as well 
and said he hopes to investi-
gate whether or not Zmiz1 plays 
a role in cancers that aren’t 
impacted by the Notch gene.

“We’ve been really focused 

on Notch-dependent tumors, 
but you also have a lot of Notch-
independent cancers,” Chiang 
said. “We’re actually looking 
into that — to see whether or not 
our protein may be important 
for other non-Notch functions. 
That’s a good area of investiga-
tion right now.”

Liu said she believes the 

research will have a significant 
impact on cancer treatment in 
the future.

“There’s a lot of implications 

for therapy and using our pro-
tein or other proteins in that 
pathway as targets for drugs,” 
she said.

U-M economics 
professor awarded 
$2.1M grant for 
data project

Martha J. Bailey, an associate 

professor of economics, received 
a $2.1 million grant from the 
National 
Science 
Foundation 

to go toward the creation of the 
Longitudinal 
Intergenerational 

Family Electronic Micro-Database. 

The project, referred to as 

LIFE-M, will compile millions 
of records from U.S. citizens 
to show how individuals and 
families have changed since the 
beginning of the 20th century. 
The database will include health, 
family, demographic and economic 
information from an individual’s 
entire life, and will span across at 
least four generations. 

The sample size of Bailey’s 

database will be unprecedented, 
as will her study of minorities, 
including immigrants and women. 

The project will receive funding 

from the NSF until August 2019. 

Uber delivering 
kittens for 
Thursday event

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, Uber will deliver kittens in 
more than 50 cities across North 
America, including Detroit, this 
Thursday.

To participate in the event, 

customers just need to log in 
to their Uber app between the 
hours of 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. 
and 
choose 
the 
“KITTENS” 

option. Once the delivery arrives, 
customers can play with the cats 
for a maximum of 15 minutes. The 
service costs $30. 

Local 
animal 
shelters 
are 

partnering with Uber, giving them 
access to the kittens for a portion 
of the company’s profitwwws in 
return. As a result of previous 
Uber Kittens events, the ride-
share 
company 
helped 
find 

permanent homes for more than 
30 kittens. 

College applications 
in UK to remove 
applicant’s name

U.K. Prime Minister David 

Cameron announced that names 
will be removed from all 2017 
applications submitted through 
the Universities and Colleges 
Admissions Service, a charity that 
facilitates the application process 
for nearly all British universities.

According to The Conversation, 

Cameron said the country’s main 
goal is to combat ethnic inequali-
ties. His made the announcement 
after a report was published that 
showed British ethinc minorities 
are less likely to be accepted to 
selective universities than white 
applicants.

While he said the reason behind 

this disparity is “complex,” Cam-
eron noted that unconscious bias 
may play a role in lower minority 
acceptence rates. 

To determine if “name-blind” 

applications 
actually 
decrease 

ethnic inequalities, UCAS has 
agreed to share application data 
with applicant permission. 

Nanotechnology 
could create new 
heart treatment

University researchers devel-

oped a new nanoparticle that 
could be the key to a new therapy 
for people suffering from cardiac 
arrhythmia. 

The 
treatment 
uses 
nano-

technology to target and destroy 
cells within the heart that cause 
cardiac arrhythmia. In stud-
ies they conducted on sheep and 
rodents, the researchers found 
that the technology kills the car-
diac 
arrhythmia-causing 
cells, 

but leaves the surrounding, non-
harmful cells untouched. 

Today in the United States, car-

diac arrhythmia affects 4 million 
Americans, killing 130,000 and 
hospitalizing more than 750,000 
people every year.

O

n the day this column is published, I 
will be en route to Detroit to spend 
the weekend indulging in my guilti-

est of guilty pleasures: 
anime conventions.

I love them. I love the 

medium, I love the cos-
tumes and, most of all, I 
love the environment of 
being with fellow fans. Not 
because of the community 
aspect of it — although 
that’s a way of looking at it 
— but rather because there’s 
no reason for me to pretend 
I don’t love Japanese car-
toons like I normally do.

On a day-to-day basis, 

anime isn’t something I bring up. When intro-
ducing myself to others, I’m more likely to bring 
up the fact that I regularly watch soap operas 
than my regular anime consumption, and that 
isn’t even a true statement about myself.

Why the secrets, though? I’m invested enough 

in this hobby that I attend annual conventions, 
yet it’s something that I actively hide about 
myself. Maybe it’s from embarrassment over not 
wanting to associate myself with some rather 
stereotypical representations of what fans are 
imagined to be, or the idea that liking something 
outside of the mainstream 
is shameful.

In a broader sense, 

though, I would say it 
comes 
from 
labeling 

anime as a guilty pleasure, 
and the idea that guilty 
pleasures exist at all. I 
won’t get into whether or 
not anime should be seen 
as something embarrass-
ing or not here (though it’s 
totally not — if you think 
giant robots fighting isn’t cool, then you’re 
wrong), but rather the concept, and hopefully 
destruction, of the “guilty pleasure.”

Everyone has interests that they don’t 

actively share with others — examples include 
ant photography, fire starting, interior design 
— and that’s fine. Maybe you just don’t want to 
bore your listener, which is fair because you’re 
probably a very “boring person,” so you don’t 
usually bring it up, but you’d be happy to talk 
about it if it does. Those aren’t guilty pleasures. 
I’m talking about interests that you actively 
hide from others. Something that you can talk 
about with a select group of friends or people 
online, but wouldn’t bring up to coworkers or 
classmates. In fact, you might even deny that 
you like this topic to these acquaintances.

Assuming your guilty pleasure isn’t anything 

that hurts you or others, or some sort of dark 
secret like being a horse whisperer, then should 
it really be a source of shame? (Also, I just … 
what? What even is that? Whatever, sorry, I 
take that back. Please tell me about it sometime. 
Maybe it’s cooler than what I just pictured.) 

Odds are, there are millions of people out 

there who share your interest; you’ve probably 
even encountered some online in fan groups 
or forums. The crazy thing about online fans 
though, is that they also exist in real life.

Those are real people. (Mostly.) With the 

same interest. You might even be friends with 
some and not know it.

Let’s use the boy band One Direction as an 

example. There’s a connotation with this group 
that in order to like them you must be a tween 
girl. And even if you are a preteen, it’s still not 
OK to like them because they’re a boy band and 
that spells manufactured pop and talentless sing-
ers. Despite this association with the group and 
its fans, though, you love it. You keep up on all 
the news about the boys and are one of the first 
to download their singles. You even would have 
gone to their concert, but, sadly, that’s crossing 
the line for the “guilty pleasure.” To have gone to 
the concert would have been an open expression 
of interest in the group and their music. People 
you know might have found out you like Harry 
best or that you know all the words to their songs. 
And you can’t have that, can you? You might get 
teased on the playground.

So, now you’ve successfully guarded this 

guilty pleasure from public exposure, except 
you didn’t get a chance to discover that you 
have people in your life who also secretly share 
this interest. Plus you missed out on seeing your 
imaginary boyfriends live on stage. You pro-
tected your outward image, but at what cost?

At what cost, indeed.
My advice, on a personal level, would be to 

own it. If you can be brave 
enough to be open about 
liking something, nega-
tive popular opinions and 
all, then no one can make 
fun of you for it (and odds 
are no one would really 
try except a quick, teasing 
jab. In fact, you can turn 
it on someone who tries 
to mock it by appearing 
confused and slightly dis-
dainful, saying, “You don’t 

like (insert non-mainstream interest such as 
beekeeping or ghost hunting)?” 

This will make the bully question not only 

their perception of popular sentiment regard-
ing your interest, but even their experience 
of reality. Is what they know real? Am I real? 
While they melt into a puddle of existential 
dread, you just became 10 percent more honest 
with yourself. Congratulations.

On a societal level, though, I’m formally 

requesting that we destroy the phrase “guilty 
pleasure.” It’s unnecessary. There’s no reason 
to have shame over what you love, even if it’s 
“nerdy” or “girly.” Actually, especially if it’s 
girly. Feminine things are great. Everyone loves 
pumpkin spice and Taylor Swift; there’s no 
need to pretend you don’t.

So, after this weekend in Detroit, when I’m 

done with cosplay and openly engaging in con-
versations about anime tropes with “real peo-
ple” in “real life,” I’m going to try to follow my 
own advice. I’ll be more open about my inter-
ests and personality.

In fact, I’ll start now: that example about lik-

ing One Direction was about me. Harry’s hair 
is dreamy, and I have no shame in saying this.

Get rid of “guilty pleasure”

SARAH 
LEESON

O

n Halloween, you won’t 
find me playing dress-up as 
a sexy (insert any animate 

or 
inanimate 

object here) and 
going out to a 
party with alco-
hol 
and 
peers 

parading around 
as “slutty rocks.” 
(I don’t get out 
much, but that’s 
probably a cos-
tume 
by 
now, 

right?) No. You’ll 
find me curled 
up in a pair of 
sweatpants and armed with a bag 
of candy and my fluffiest blanket, 
completely prepared to marathon 
Wes Craven’s masterpieces.

Craven, the master of horror and 

ultimate suspense, passed away 
this August. And while people 
tweeted 140 characters about how 
much his works would be missed in 
Hollywood, I grieved with a tub of 
Ben and Jerry’s and a marathon of 
“Scream.” But this year, though I 
will still be watching these films, I 
will be viewing them with a slightly 
different perspective.

This past summer, as a part of 

my volunteer work at the Henry 
Ford Hospital, I visited patients in 
the behavioral health section of the 
emergency room. Suddenly, the mon-
sters depicted in some of my favorite 
flicks seemed to be making fun of the 
patients I visited on a daily basis; the 
people I would get warm blankets for 
and chat with about things like the 
weather or if I had a boyfriend wait-
ing for me back at school.

My most recent viewing of Alfred 

Hitchcock’s “Psycho” in mid-sum-
mer gave me a new perspective on 
the horror genre. In an iconic scene, 
Norman Bates runs into the cellar 
after Marion Crane, knife-happy 
and screaming, “I’m Norma Bates!” 
dressed like his deceased mother. 
Suddenly, a scene I had once found 
entertaining, funny even, became 
sad. Norman Bates, the best-known 
serial killer in cinematic history, 

was deeply, mentally disturbed, and 
I thought it was funny?

It was the small pop-in visits 

during the day that slowly started 
to change my perception of how I 
was watching these movies. These 
monster creations of Craven and 
Hitchcock were loosely based off 
real, underlying mental disorders 
that often lead to so much suffering.

Growing up in a cinematic melt-

ing pot that included a spanned from 
Disney movies to “The Addams 
Family” reruns, I didn’t have to be 
scared of ghosts and ghouls or the 
monster under my bed when Fran-
kenstein was a blue-collar worker 
with a family, did I? I loved the 
black-and-white shows my par-
ents let me watch. “The Munsters” 
reassured me, more than anything 
my 
parents 

told me, that 
monsters were 
the 
creation 

of 
entertain-

ment. 
Mon-

sters belonged 
to 
normal 

families 
just 

trying to fit in. 
I could under-
stand that as 
a 
10-year-old 

girl, 
which 

took a lot of fear away when I was 
young. But at 19, how could I ignore 
the reality of my monsters?

Craven was my superhero. His 

films bathed in pure cinematic 
genius that always found a way 
to give me chills regardless of the 
number of times I watched them. I 
jump in fear, shake in anticipation 
and yell at the victims to “run out 
the freaking door into safety,” and 
“don’t hide in plain sight unless you 
want to die there!”

His films made me genuinely 

scared, which is a feat most con-
temporary horror films don’t come 
close to achieving. And it is in this 
aspect that I still appreciate his 
work, especially the classic “Night-
mare on Elm Street” and “Scream” 
franchises. They create that rush, 

that scare that only really good 
classic scary movies can.

I still watch horror movies, but 

how I choose to interpret them 
has changed since last Hallow-
een. And although I still consider 
“Scream” my favorite horror movie, 
I’ve found that the experience is 
much more enjoyable when you can 
separate the fiction from the real-
ity. I’m not telling everyone to stop 
watching horror movies or that you 
can’t enjoy “Psycho” without feel-
ing guilty. I’m just asking that you 
respect that there are people who 
are actually sick and behave in 
certain ways due to their illnesses, 
which is something that horror 
films exploit at times, even subcon-
sciously, to create characters such 
as Freddy or Norman Bates.

So, 
this 

coming 
Hal-

loween night, 
consider stay-
ing 
in 
and 

watching 
“Scream” with 
some friends, 
honoring Wes 
Craven’s mem-
ory the right 
way — not as 
a slutty rock. 
I can’t prom-

ise you will have more fun — that 
part is up to you. But I can say that 
you’ll stay a lot warmer and make 
lifelong memories of “that one 
time you scared the pants off your 
jumpy friend” and ate those little 
candy pumpkins all cuddled up in 
an extra-large cozy blanket with 
your besties.

And who knows? Maybe you’ll 

learn something new along the way 
and come to appreciate horror mov-
ies the same way I have. Overall, I 
guess I just have one thing left to 
say: Thank you. Thank you for the 
screams, Mr. Craven.

In Memory of Wes Craven, master 

of horror (1939-2015).

T

hroughout my childhood, 
my dad treated his three 
children exactly the same. 

We 
all 
played 

sports with him, 
we all watched 
New York Giants 
games with him 
and he bought 
all three of us Derek Jeter jerseys 
every year. My sister and I couldn’t 
be less interested in sports. My 
brother is an avid Yankees, Giants, 
Rangers and, even occasionally, 
Knicks fan. 

Why did this happen? Is it 

intrinsic in our genetic makeup? Or 
is it society?

Many would argue that society 

taught me from a young age to like 
shopping and my brother, David, to 
like sports. Yet it hardly feels that 
way. I had all of the opportunities 
I wanted to become obsessed with 
the Yankees, and he had plenty of 
chances to become enthusiastic 
about Bloomingdale’s. Yet here 
we are. My sister and I both fit 
innumerable stereotypes of girls. 
We like nail polish, getting dressed 
up, gossiping, social sciences and 
occasional reality TV. 

While my brother admits to liking 

certain reality TV, he likes fantasy 
football, playing soccer and math 
much more. My sister and I both 
actually like math, so I shouldn’t 
withhold that information to force 
my argument. However, neither 
of us chose to major in anything 
STEM-related.

What is it that scares girls off 

from math and science? Why is it 
that in seventh grade, more girls take 
algebra than boys, yet when phys-

ics rolls around in 11th grade, more 
boys enroll than girls? This pat-
tern continues in the world beyond 
high school where, according to the 
Department of Education, women 
make up less than 25 percent of pro-
fessionals in STEM fields.

I refuse to believe that women are 

innately lesser than men in STEM 
fields. I don’t remember the day I 
stopped thinking, I am completely 
smart and capable. However, I do 
remember the first time I felt nervous 
to raise my hand because I thought a 
boy in the room would know the bet-
ter answer. I thought of myself as the 
smartest girl in the room, but not the 
smartest 
per-

son. I was 12 
years old.

In 
ninth 

grade, 
I 

transferred 
to 
an 
all-

girls 
high 

school. There 
I 
realized 

that I wasn’t 
even close to 
the 
smartest 

girl in the room. I was suddenly 
surrounded by geniuses. While an 
all-girls school is meant to give you 
the confidence to go out into the 
world and be the best, I think it did 
just the opposite. I was taught to be 
brave in front of other girls, but not 
other people. Everything changed 
when I came to the University.

Suddenly I was thrust into a huge 

campus with thousands of intel-
ligent youths, half of whom were 
men. I was back in my 12-year-old 
shoes. Would the boys think I’m 
stupid? Would they know the right 

answer? Would they laugh at me? 

I really do sound like a middle 

schooler. 

Maybe an all-girls school slowed 

my development — who knows. What 
matters is that I felt the same fear I 
had once felt, despite being taught 
that I’m an intelligent woman who 
could amount to anything.

Yet, I feel this firsthand in my 

classes here at the University. I have 
observed that when men have an idea 
that they’re not totally sure about, 
they say it anyway. When it comes 
to complex topics I often watch 
women sit back in their seats and 
observe. Of course, I’m only speaking 

from my own 
experience; 
I 

can’t speak for 
every 
woman 

in 
every 

classroom. But, 
what I know 
for sure is that 
I 
personally 

have 
felt 

intimidated to 
speak because 
of what the men 

in the classroom might think. I have 
to wonder where this stems from, 
because I know it isn’t in my genetics.

Some things will never change. 

When my parents go on vacation, 
they usually bring my brother back 
a jersey and me a piece of jewelry. 
I don’t blame them, I would rather 
have jewelry, after all, and David 
would rather have a jersey. 

It certainly isn’t my parent’s 

fault; it’s society’s.

O

n any given night, The Michigan Daily 
newsroom is filled with a dedicated 
group of students who are running 

on too much coffee and too little sleep, pains-
takingly planning, writing and editing stories. 
Producing a daily newspaper requires the coor-
dination and combined efforts of people work-
ing tirelessly to cover news and culture on and 
off campus. 

Many freshmen wander into the newsroom 

for mass meetings in the beginning of the year, 
eager to partake in something bigger than 
themselves. Some sections seem “cool” and 
“fun” and “actually produce content.” They lure 
in new staffers with the prospects of one day 
traveling all over the country to cover cham-
pionship games, interview presidential candi-
dates and attend exclusive music festivals. 

“Grammar is so fun,” we say. You read every-

thing, and get to contemplate if there should be a 
hyphen in phrases like “health care education.” 
This never seems to elicit the same reaction.

Copy editors tend to be a quieter breed. 

Though you won’t see our names displayed 
in the paper, we play a critical role in uphold-
ing the integrity of the Daily as a trustworthy 
news publication. Our editors scrutinize every 
comma and every fact, and we pride ourselves 
on polishing and verifying the stories that go 
through our editing process. No, we don’t cover 
cool stories or blast music quite as loudly as the 
news desk, but we are just as important to the 

paper as any other section. And as we see it, the 
time has finally come for the copy desk to have 
a voice. 

First, we would like to take this opportunity 

to thank all of the editors and writers for put-
ting up with the air of pretension that some-
times lingers in our copy notes. We know it’s 
hard to like someone whose sole purpose is to 
highlight every grammatical and factual mis-
take you make. We know you use the Oxford 
comma in all of your academic papers, e-mails, 
texts and basically every other part of your life. 
And you’re outraged by the fact that AP style 
dictates that we delete every. last. one. We get 
it. We sympathize.

Second, we’d like to formally announce 

the start of our new column, Copy That. It’s a 
shame that all this grammarly knowledge and 
witty insight to the newsroom is confined to 
our 11-by-5-foot desk. If you want to learn some 
fun and flirty grammar tips, weird rules from 
our official style guide and hilarious grammar 
fails we uncover in our work, you’ve come to the 
right place. 

So, whether you’re looking to improve your 

grammar to boost the grade on your next paper 
or simply looking for a laugh, we promise to 
deliver educational, witty and grammatically 
correct content. Copy That.

Time in Connecticut gym 
forged Selman’s dedication

Working with NHL 

players showed 
assistant captain 

the way

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

As an assistant captain for 

the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team, 

Justin Selman has a lot of 
responsibilities both on and off 
the ice.

But the biggest quality the 

senior forward brings is his 
dedication 
and 
work 
ethic, 

which in turn has set an example 
for the rest of the team and 
earned him recognition this 
past summer, when he was 
named a 2014-15 Strength and 
Conditioning 
Athlete 
of 
the 

Year by the National Strength 
and Conditioning Association. 
The award is given to collegiate 
athletes who have dedicated 
themselves to strength training 
and conditioning, as chosen by 
strength coaches.

“I know that the guys who 

won it with or before me were 
Derek DeBlois, Mac Bennett, 
Zach Hyman and Andrew Copp,” 
Selman said. “All of those guys 
were great leaders and hard 
workers.

“I didn’t really know what was 

required to get the award, but 
anytime you get recognized for 
something you do, it’s nice to see 
that your hard work gets noticed, 
and it’s something to keep in the 
back of your mind when you’re 
working out.”

But 
Selman’s 
journey 
to 

developing the work ethic he 
has today began four years ago, 
when he discovered the Prentiss 
Hockey Performance gym in 
Darien, Connecticut.

The gym, which is about 1,000 

square feet and is built inside 
an old gas station, is run by Ben 
Prentiss, and has become a place 
where National Hockey League 
players flock to during the 
offseason to work out.

As for Selman, it took him only 

one step into the building before 
he was hooked.

“I knew a few guys who had 

mentioned it to me who had 
been there before — some college 
players,” Selman said. “So I 
checked it out one summer, and I 
loved it from the first day.”

While the training is extensive 

and effective, the biggest lesson 
Selman took away from the 
gym wasn’t from the trainers, 
but from the NHL players who 
worked out there.

In 
particular, 
Martin 
St. 

Louis, formerly of the Tampa 
Bay Lightning and the New York 
Rangers, was someone Selman 
looked up to.

“He just worked out so hard 

everyday, and he has a family,” 
Selman said. “He showed me 
that there were no excuses. He 
would come in at 6 a.m. or 9 p.m., 
whenever he could find an hour 
or two to work out. He showed 
me that whether you’re tired or 
have a lot of stuff going on, you 
still have to make time for the 
stuff that’s important.”

The gym not only helped 

him with his strength and 
conditioning, but also helped him 
revamp his diet, which gave him 
more energy and stamina.

“Going in, I thought I ate pretty 

healthy, but (Prentiss) kind of 
flipped my diet upside down,” 
Selman said. “Everything he 
told me to do, within a month, I 
noticed I had a lot more energy. I 
really leaned out, but I was putting 
on weight at the same time. I felt a 
lot stronger, a lot more alert.

“I cut out all the processed 

food, as much as I could. I might 
have wheat bread here and there 
if I have to. It’s hard on the road 
and in college, but in the summer, 
I’m really strict about it. I try to 
eat grass-fed meat if I can and 
a lot of stuff you find at Whole 
Foods. It’s a little more expensive, 
but it definitely pays off.”

This past summer, Selman 

moved away from the Prentiss 
gym, deciding to work out in 
Ann Arbor with strength and 
conditioning coach Joe Maher.

While Selman said his time 

with Maher was the hardest 
summer workout he has ever 
done, staying in Michigan was 
equally about being back around 
his teammates.

“In the summer, when we’re 

all here working out, some of the 
days get a little bit long,” Selman 
said. “As a leader, you have to be 
the one who guys look to that’s 
working the hardest. You have to 
be someone who can be looked up 
to that is working as hard as they 
can.”

Added Maher: “He has a belief 

in the program here, and he has 
belief in our standards here. We 
want a culture where guys don’t 
want to leave and stay here and 
be together with their teammates 
as much as possible.”

But just because Selman wasn’t 

working out at the Prentiss gym, 
it didn’t mean that he left behind 
the consistency he had learned 
from his summers in Darien.

“It 
wasn’t 
always 
what 

(Selman) was doing in the weight 
room (this summer),” Maher 
said. “He understood there was 
a whole other picture in the 20 
hours he wasn’t in the weight 
room that he committed himself 
to. That started off with nutrition 
and went into recovery.”

And the results have shown. 

Selman has already scored two 
goals and tallied four assists, 
totaling six points through four 
games — a number he didn’t 
reach until midway through last 
season.

“He’s got some more jump,” 

Maher said. “He’s gained some 
speed, and he’s gained a step. 
He’s gained some explosiveness, 
which is good. He also has that 
ability later in practices and 
games, so he doesn’t fizzle out.”

Selman’s work over the past 

four summers has culminated 
into a final season at Michigan, 
when he looks to lead the 
Wolverines back to the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time in 
three years.

And if it happens, at least some 

of the credit has to go to that old 
gas station in Connecticut.

Thome finding her niche, 
playing time in Ann Arbor

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team didn’t just lose 
critical 
leadership 
with 
the 

departures of Cyesha Goree, 
Nicole Elmblad and Shannon 
Smith — it also lost 59 percent of its 
rebounding, one of the strengths 
that boosted the Wolverines into 
the 2015 WNIT Semifinals.

Michigan’s 
best 
returning 

rebounders are senior forward 
Kelsey Mitchell and sophomore 
forward Jillian Dunston, but 
they will need help in recreating 
Goree and Elmblad-like results. 
Mitchell is still recovering from 
two seasons worth of injuries, and 
Dunston is still finding her groove 
at the college level. 

That’s where Hallie Thome 

steps in.

The freshman is now the 

Wolverines’ 
tallest player 
and the first 
6-foot-5 
center 
since 

Krista Phillips 
(2009-10), 
making 
her 
one 
of 

Michigan’s 
most valuable 
assets 
beneath 
the 

basket this year. On her way to 
becoming Ohio’s Gatorade High 
School Player of the Year, Thome 
averaged 19.5 points, 9.1 rebounds 
and 4.6 blocks during her senior 
year in Chagrin Falls.

The 
impressive 
stat 
sheet 

would 
make 
any 
college 

basketball program chase the 
four-star recruit, but Thome’s eye 
had always been on Michigan, 
especially after she suffered a 
knee injury her junior year that 
sidelined her for all but six games.

“I took it as whoever’s going to 

leave, I don’t want them,” Thome 
said. “It’s basketball at the college 
level — you’re going to get hurt. I 
wanted to make sure I had people 
who had my back, so Michigan 
was calling and texting every day 
and making sure I was good. It 

just helped me realize even more 
that they’re always there for me, 
and I (was) part of the family even 
though I hadn’t committed yet.”

With two weeks of practice 

under her belt, the results have 
been a “pleasant surprise” for 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico, who has never coached 
a player of Thome’s stature and 
skill.

Even with the expectation 

for Thome to help take over the 
rebounding presence left behind 
by Goree and Elmblad, there is 
still a lot of work ahead for the 
freshman. She only just started 
seriously lifting this summer, 
something 
the 
upperclassmen 

have been doing for years.

Thome is also dealing with the 

challenges brought by the bigger 
and more physical male practice 
squad that the team competes 
against, especially since the only 

boy she had ever 
played 
against 

previously was 
her brother.

“She’s 

obviously 
still 
a 
work 

in 
progress,” 

Barnes 
Arico 

said. “She has 
never 
played 

against the size 
and the speed 

that she’s going to face with the 
Marylands of the world or the 
Rutgers of the world. With the 
teams in our league, she’s never 
experienced that. She’s shown in 
the last 10 practices the ability to 
hang in there and do a really good 
job. But with her, it’s going to be 
some days really good, and some 
days she’s going to get banged up.”

Added 
Thome: 
“It’s 

challenging at times. … In high 
school, I wouldn’t say it was 
easy, but I mean, now I’m playing 
against people who are bigger and 
stronger. It’s definitely good to see 
the challenges and take them on 
each day.”

But Thome has had a helping 

hand in adjusting to college life. 
After coming to campus, she 
immediately clicked with senior 

guard Madison Ristovski — a 
familiar face from her past.

In eighth grade, Thome started 

attending the basketball camps in 
Ann Arbor and caught the eye of 
then-head coach Kevin Borseth, 
who put her on the Wolverines’ 
recruiting radar early on. During 
practice 
games, 
Thome 
was 

placed on a team with Ristovski, 
then a senior in high school who 
had just committed to Michigan.

“We always joke about it,” 

Thome said. “I couldn’t catch 
the ball when I was younger, and 
she is good at those sneak passes. 
(Now) she’s like, ‘Hallie, I just 
need you to catch a ball. Just be 
ready, because it’s gonna come to 
you.’ It’s great to see the progress 
from what it was back then to 
what it is now working together.”

Added Ristovski: “She always 

says she couldn’t catch anything, 
and she couldn’t finish. We 
laugh about it now, because who 
would’ve thought four years later, 
here she is and here I am.”

Over the summer, Ristovski 

partnered with Thome during 
weight training and has since 
been one of her teachers as Thome 
has gotten used to the faster pace 
and tougher atmosphere of college 
basketball. It’s only one example 
of how Ristovski has gladly taken 
on senior responsibilities as she 
helps foster the growth of the 
younger players.

“On Twitter, I saw something 

about preseason freshman of 
the year. … It wasn’t Hallie. It 
was some girl from Nebraska,” 
Ristovski said. “I screenshotted it, 
sent the picture to her and I said, 
‘This is motivation. Understand 
what you’re doing everyday. It’s 
going to make a difference when 
the season comes.’ ”

Thome wasn’t the preseason 

freshman of the year, but in due 
time, she will have a few accolades 
of her own — maybe many. For her, 
there couldn’t be a better place to 
earn them than Michigan. For the 
last five years, it has felt like home.

Now, it finally is. 
“I can’t ask for anything better,” 

Thome said. “I have to take it all 
in, relax and do my thing.”

Three quick goals 
doom Wolverines

By ORION SANG 

For the Daily

It took just two and a half 

minutes for a scoreless tie to turn 
into a rout.

In its final matchup before 

the Big Ten Tournament, the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
lost to No. 
10 
Penn 

State, 3-1.

The 

Wolverines (6-3-3 Big Ten, 11-6-
2 overall) struggled on offense 
for most of the night, and several 
critical breakdowns on defense 
allowed the Nittany Lions (8-2-1, 
13-3-2) to score three goals in a 
two-and-a-half minute span near 
the end of the first half.

“They were a better team 

tonight,” said Michigan senior 
midfielder Corinne Harris. “We 
can learn from their performance.”

Michigan started off the game 

controlling 
possession. 
The 

Wolverines’ first scoring chance 
came when Harris was able to 
twist past a Penn State defender 
and quickly unleash a shot, but it 
was too high.

Despite the early advantage in 

possession, Michigan was unable 
to generate many other scoring 
opportunities. 
The 
wet 
field 

may have also contributed to the 
offensive struggles, as players fell 
down multiple times and many 
passes were unsuccessful.

“We played really well for the 

first part of the game and created 
some good goal-scoring chances 
in the first 20 minutes,” said 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan.

As the first half progressed, 

the Nittany Lions began to take 
control on offense and almost 
scored 29 minutes into the game. 
Penn State forward Mallory Weber 

took a header off a free kick, and 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Megan 

Hinz was not able to corral the ball. 
Luckily for Michigan, Hinz fell on 
the rebound and saved a goal.

But Penn State scored just three 

minutes later.

A Michigan defender turned 

the ball over, and the Nittany 
Lions took advantage. Forward 
Raquel Rodriguez received the 
ball from a teammate and scored 
off a shot from the left side.

It was only the beginning of a 

scoring onslaught.

A minute later, the Wolverines 

turned the ball over once again 
on their side of the field, and Penn 
State forward Megan Schafer 
slid the ball past Hinz, making 
Michigan pay for another mistake.

Penn State wasn’t done, netting 

its third goal a minute later, when 
midfielder 
Nickolette 
Driesse 

scored from 30 yards out to beat 
Hinz.

When the onslaught ended in 

the 35th minute, the Nittany Lions 
had three goals in two and a half 
minutes. 

“We’ve just got to defend 

better,” Ryan said. “We gave away 
three very unpressured goals.”

Despite 
the 
large 
deficit, 

Michigan didn’t go out without a 
fight.

In 
the 
87th 
minute, 
the 

Wolverines got on the scoreboard 
when senior midfielder Cassie 
Collins 
hammered 
home 
a 

rebound opportunity.

But it was only one goal, and the 

Wolverines know they will have 
to make adjustments heading into 
postseason play.

“We have to get back to how we 

have been defending,” Ryan said. 
“We’re not going to win games 
with the way we played in the 
back today.”

Michigan prepares for Minnesota, minus Jerry Kill 

Citing health 

reasons, Golden 

Gophers head coach 

announces his 

retirement

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan and Minnesota 

football teams are both coming 
off bye weeks heading into their 
clash in Minneapolis on Saturday 
night. They have had time in the 
past two weeks to recover from 
losses, and time to prepare for 
each other.

But Wednesday, the contest 

became 
an 
entirely 
new 

matchup.

Minnesota announced around 

7:30 a.m. that head coach Jerry 
Kill would step 
down effective 
immediately 
for 
health 

reasons. 
Kill, 

who 
was 

diagnosed 
with epilepsy 
in 2005, was 
in 
his 
fifth 

season 
with 

the 
Golden 

Gophers. 
He 

suffered game-day seizures in 
each of his first three seasons 
(2011 to 2013), taking a leave of 
absence in 2013 to focus on his 
health.

Before his decision to retire 

Wednesday, he had not had a 
reported incident since 2013.

“I was shocked, really,” said 

Michigan secondary coach Greg 

Jackson. “Sorry 
for Minnesota, 
but we will play 
Saturday. One 
thing 
we’re 

focused on is 
winning 
the 

football 
game 

and 
playing 

great defense.”

Tight 
ends 

coach 
Jay 

Harbaugh was 

also saddened by the news.

“I figured it was something 

that had to be pretty serious,” 
Harbaugh said. “You never want 
to do anything like that. I know 
he had a background of certain 
health issues, so you just hope 
and pray that he gets healthy, 

and then his family deals with 
everything all right. It’s a 
serious thing.”

Kill 
revealed 
in 
a 
press 

conference Wednesday that his 
health issues had escalated once 
again, and the stress of the job 
only compounded them. He said 
he hadn’t slept more than three 
hours in a night in the past three 
weeks.

As the season moves into its 

second 
half, 
Kill’s 
struggles 

could serve as a cautionary tale 
for other coaches who are under 
similar stress.

“I think a lot of it has to do 

with your work environment,” 
Harbaugh said. “A lot of the 
guys I work with, they’re serious 
about 
football, 
but 
they’re 

lighthearted guys. It’s fun, it’s 
loose and serious at the same 

time, if that makes any sense.”

The Wolverines now have 

three days to prepare to face a 
Minnesota team with a new face 
at the helm.

If any team is prepared for 

this sort of event, though, 
it’s the Golden Gophers. Kill 
coached from the press box 
during games in 2011 and 2012, 
while 
defensive 
coordinator 

Tracy Claeys led from the 
sideline. Claeys also took over in 
Kill’s absence two seasons ago, 
winning four of seven games 
while in charge.

And now, Claeys — who has 

been an assistant coach on Kill’s 
staff since they coached together 
at Saginaw Valley State in 1995 
and was promoted to defensive 
coordinator in 1999 at Emporia 
State — takes over for the rest of 

the season.

Minnesota is 4-3 after a 48-25 

loss to Nebraska on Oct. 17. Last 
season, the Golden Gophers 
routed Michigan in Ann Arbor, 
30-14, on their way to an 8-5 
finish.

They 
have 
established 

themselves as a power-running 
team, and the Wolverines don’t 
expect to see anything different 
Saturday, even without Kill.

“I think that’s very indicative 

of who he is, maybe the best 
credit to him,” Harbaugh said. 
“They would play like their hair’s 
on fire regardless. I think that 
says a lot about who he is and 
how he coaches.

“You’re not going to show up 

and see a different team. I think 
that’s how he would want it, too, 
and that’s how those guys play.”

“Sorry for 

Minnesota, but 

we will play 
Saturday.”

Wilson, Wagner 
learning in post

By LEV FACHER 

Managing Editor

Versatility is both a blessing 

and a curse for Michigan men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein, 
who’s spending much of the 2015-
16 preseason teaching a crop of 
underclassman big men both 
the power forward and center 
positions.

While sophomore Ricky Doyle 

seems a safe bet to earn the bulk 
of playing time in the low post 
this season, the list of players who 
might back him up or spend time 
at the ‘4’ spot is still in question. 
Among 
those 
center-forward 

hybrids are redshirt freshman 
D.J. Wilson and freshman Moritz 
Wagner, each of whom is listed at 
6-foot-10.

“It’s much easier for them just 

to be at one position,” Beilein said 
last week. “Fortunately, both Moe 
and D.J. are pretty good with 
picking different things up, and 
that’s really been good. Moe is 
exceptional.”

Michigan’s ninth-year coach, 

however, has little choice but 
to hedge his bets. Sophomore 
Kameron Chatman and redshirt 
sophomore Mark Donnal were 
both inconsistent in 2014-15, and 
they, too, could see minutes at 
spots other than power forward 
— Donnal at center and Chatman 
at small forward.

Wilson is the likeliest of the 

bunch to be relied upon heavily 
at both big-man spots. Since 
clocking in at 215 pounds prior to 
his freshman season, he says he 
has added 25 pounds of muscle. 
He showed flashes of potential 
early last season before suffering 
a knee injury in November, 
eventually spending the year 
redshirting.

The prospect of alternating 

between 
spots 
doesn’t 
faze 

Wilson, however.

“I 
don’t 
really 
have 
a 

preference,” he said. “It’s not 
really an issue for me. I’ve 
been playing multiple positions 
throughout my career.”

The injury gave Wilson a 

rare opportunity to add size 
and condition during the season 
without substantially impacting 
the 
Wolverines’ 
full-season 

prognosis, 
which 
later 
took 

bigger hits following the losses of 
starters Caris LeVert and Derrick 
Walton Jr.

“Me getting hurt last year and 

redshirting was a big benefit for 

me and the team,” Wilson said. “I 
gained a lot of weight and became 
more athletic.”

Wagner, however, hasn’t yet 

had the opportunity to add the size 
that Wilson will likely depend on 
down low this season. That hasn’t 
stopped 
Beilein 
from 
raving 

about his ability throughout the 
preseason, but he has consistently 
acknowledged that the 18-year-
old German’s youth can lead to 
awkward 
on-court 
sequences 

during practice.

Michigan’s coaching staff isn’t 

giving much away about Wagner 
in the early going, preserving his 
status as the Wolverines’ biggest 
wild 
card. 
Beilein 
wouldn’t 

hazard a guess as to which 
position Wagner might appear 
at in the early going, and while 
assistant coach Bacari Alexander 
offered a long-term assessment, 
he also hesitated to make a 
prediction for the season’s first 
weeks.

“If you’re projecting out for 

Moe 
Wagner, 
he’s 
probably 

going to end up being a ‘4’-man,” 
Alexander said. “Reason being, 
his skill set, coming from the 
farm systems of Berlin, Germany, 
has called for him to be so 
multifaceted where he can make 
3s; he can put the ball on the floor 
and make plays for others; he 
has the ability to post up smaller 
defenders.”

The 
biggest 
deficiency 
in 

Wagner’s game, according to 
both Beilein and Alexander, is 
his rebounding ability. But he’ll 
have the opportunity to ease into 
college play against teams that 
will be heavy underdogs entering 
Ann Arbor.

The Wolverines begin their 

schedule 
with 
an 
exhibition 

against Le Moyne on Nov. 6, 
followed 
by 
matchups 
with 

Northern Michigan and Elon. 
Those games, in which Michigan 
will 
likely 
hold 
substantial 

advantages in talent and size, 
could provide an early idea of 
which players will see minutes 
and where they slot in.

The going gets tougher over 

Thanksgiving, as the Wolverines 
travel to the Bahamas to face a 
pool of competition that includes 
Connecticut, Syracuse, Gonzaga 
and Texas in the Battle 4 Atlantis. 
There, size will matter, and that 
tournament could provide the 
first real test in physicality for the 
Wolverines’ front line, however it 
shapes up.

Lights On

Fall had peaked on Saturday as we drove down the winding 

road speckled with autumnal hues and overarching amber trees. 
Nature’s festive display almost made me forget the reason Hailey 
and I were taking a half-hour trek out of Ann Arbor.

Growing up on ghost stories and Halloween, haunted sites and 

lore have always intrigued me — at least, from a distance. I was 
eager to snag the opportunity to write about walking through a 
haunted forest, but it took until the day of our trip to the Terror-
fied Forest for my rational mind to kick into action and my feet 
to turn cold. Memories of walking through haunted forests with 
my grandma reeled through my head: My grandma, born on Hal-
loween and predestined to enjoy it, had laughed the whole way; 
while I, a middle schooler who had just overcome my fear of dogs, 
did not.

Around 7 p.m., we followed an arrow sign into a field at the end 

of the road. The late-October dusk was just beginning to settle as 
we stepped out of Hailey’s Jeep, and we were greeted by a man 
dressed in black who spoke with a deep voice. After discovering 
we were reporters, not actors for the forest, he led us to meet one 
of the owners, Cindy Murphy-Broadbent, at her house not far from 
the parking lot. There, we were welcomed by a dozen ghouls gath-
ered around a bonfire, applying their terrifying makeup. A woman 
with bloody barbed wire wrapped around her face pressed flesh 
wounds to a man’s face; another woman was smearing white paint 
over her cheekbones while a third monster airbrushed an actor’s 
face.

Murphy-Broadbent came out of the house. She was an older 

woman, with cropped white hair and a lifelong passion for Hal-
loween. As she approached, an actress mentioned that the house 
was decorated with spooky decor all year long.

“I just always liked Halloween,” Murphy-Broadbent said. “You 

can dress up if you want, you don’t have to if you don’t want. You 
can give candy if you want, you don’t have to if you don’t want. You 
can have a lot of fun with it, or you don’t have to. So, it’s a great 
holiday.”

The Terrorfied Forest was first created as a haunted hayride 

surprise birthday party. The party was such a hit that Murphy-
Broadbent and her husband, Dean, continued to host it for five 
years until friends convinced them to open it to the public. Now it’s 
a 30-minute walk for three-quarters of a mile through the woods. 
The forest opens for business the second weekend of September 
through Halloween night, as well as on the Friday the 13th in No-
vember.

It was inching closer to 8 p.m. when the trail officially opened. 

Murphy-Broadbent offered to lead us back to the entrance so she 
could open the ticket booth. The man who we had seen being 
made-up with fake flesh had now transformed into a monster; he 
snuck up behind us as we lingered, growling and barking. Hailey 
shrieked. We eagerly left the ghouls.

By now it was dark out, the 

entrance sign illuminated by a 
string of lights. It had rained 
earlier that day and lone clouds 
still hung in front of the bright, 
nearly full moon; it was the 
kind of night you’d expect were-
wolves to transform — and that’s 
not an exaggeration. It was hard 
not to take the ominous hint and 
begin worrying again.

It suddenly dawned on me that 

it may not have been the best idea 
to tell all of the actors we were 
reporters.

The main area was a large field 

that resembled a movie set: a ticket 
booth, haunted house, a ghoulish 
tree for photos and a food trailer 
glowing yellow, all dispersed along 
the edges. With half an hour until 
the trail opened, we naturally 
headed to the snacks: cider for 
$1.50, cider and a doughnut for 
$2.50. The actors, all teenagers 
with painted faces, were gathered 
there, too.

A 
freshman 
from 
Eastern 

Michigan University, dressed as 
Frankenstein, said he enjoyed 
working at the Terrorfied Forest; 
it was a good weekend job. He was 
able to spend the money he made 
from scaring willing individuals 
and save what he made from his 
day job.

Frankenstein said he’s never 

scared when he’s in the forest 
waiting for passersby. I under-
stood this more later when I 
walked through — as the trail is lit 
by red lights — but at the time, I 
was skeptical.

Young girls with caked-on 

red cheeks and freckles said 
they worked in the Fun House, 
which people could pay extra to 
go through before the trail. They 
said that some people are scared, 
some flirt and many crack jokes. 
The nun said she had heard all the 
“nun puns” in the book. The most 
common: “I’ll have nun of that!”

People of all ages began arriv-

ing. By the time we left that night, 
the parking lot would be full. The 
actors explained that the week 
before Halloween was peak week 
for the haunted trail: costume 
parties had only just begun, but 
people were in the spirit.

Lights Off

A single doorframe, propped 

up like the forgotten remains of a 
burned-down building, marked 
the entrance to the Terror-
fied Forest. A costumed woman 
stood in the shadows as Emma 
and I approached, her smeared 
white makeup catching the glow 
of the orange lights overhead. In 
her hands was a hatchet.

“Are you two with a group?” 

she asked. Maybe I imagined it, 
but she seemed to smirk at the 
question, her charcoal-rimmed 
eyes glinting. If the smokey-eye 
look was intimidating on a nor-
mal basis, this chick took it to a 
whole new level.

“Um,” Emma said, stalling. 

Survival tip number one: Never 
go alone.

We locked eyes with the 

couple next to us, high school 
kids on a Saturday night date, 
willing them to take two col-

lege students under their wing 
for the night. It was a low point, 
but fear makes people do crazy 
things, like sleep with the lights 
on for a month after watching 
a scary movie (this is why you 
should never watch “Silence of 
the Lambs”). Besides, we were 
being practical — it’s all about 
strength in numbers. No Uni-
versity of Michigan-educated 
person would venture into the 
creepy woods alone.

“Do you mind if we come 

with you?” I blurted. The girl, 
bless her, nodded enthusiasti-
cally, agreeing with our group 
mentality or maybe just taking 
pity on us. Her boyfriend gamely 
agreed, possibly hating us for 
tagging along. (Boys, take note: 
A haunted forest is not a roman-
tic date. Your girlfriend will be 
terrified, possibly crying, want-
ing to get out of there as soon as 
possible. If you want a fun fall 
activity, stick to scary movies 
and pumpkin carving.)

At the entrance to a haunted 

forest — a forest that the ticket 
lady warned takes 30 to 40 min-
utes to travel through — manners 
were not our highest priority. So 
when the hostess told us to line 
up single file to enter, we pushed 
the boy to the front.

The door thudded behind us, 

drowning out the woman’s cack-
le. “Don’t touch anything and it 
won’t touch you back!” she said.

In nervous silence, we walked 

along a narrow trail, guided 
by hanging red bulbs on low-
slung branches. Leaves whipped 
around our feet in tiny torna-
dos, hiding roots, making us 
step carefully in the darkness 
and ignore our instinct to run. 
Though 
my 
awareness 
was 

piqued for any type of movement 
— a sinister shadow lurking 
behind a tree, the ominous snap 
of a twig — I couldn’t help but 
notice the beauty of the woods 
in the nighttime. The moon was 
nearly full, flooding the forest 
with light; it was almost peace-
ful, being outside and away from 
the bustle of campus.

For a while, there was no 

movement. We kept walking, 
winding through the woods. 
We knew that there were about 
80 terrifying employees waiting 
for us in the forest — but where 
were they? I started to enjoy 
myself, thinking of our tour as 
a midnight nature walk. This 
would go great with some hot 
apple cider.

Survival tip number two: 

Never let your guard down. 
As I peered around the bend, 
a throaty snarl erupted from 
behind a tree. A wolf-creature 
sprung onto the path, half 
crawling and jumping toward 
our group. We screamed and 
stumbled, running up a ramp 
that led to a shed pulsing with 
strobe lights.

The wolf-creature left us 

alone, but the shed — and the 
other makeshift shacks that 
would follow it on the trail — 
brought a new terror: the fear 
of being in a confined space of 
horror, with a lurking mon-
ster and nowhere to run. (In 
“Silence of the Lambs,” this is 
the situation that frightened 

me the most; in the final scene 
of the movie, detective Clarice 
is unknowingly trapped in the 
basement with Buffalo Bill, a 
cannibalistic serial killer, with 
the lights off.) At this point, the 
four of us abandoned all formal-
ity, clutching each other’s shirts 
as we entered the shed.

“This is the last thing I need 

right now,” Emma said, groan-
ing. The room was filled with 
swinging 
black 
tubes, 
like 

punching bags, their move-
ments warped and disorienting 
from the blinding strobe lights 
overhead. Everything was puls-
ing. We wove through the tubes, 
gripping each other tightly, our 
vision blurred and jaunty — was 
that movement a person? Or 
was it just us in here? — when a 
stranger’s voice shrieked from 
the corner of the room. He stag-
gered toward us, moving fast 
and in slow motion at the same 
time, his manic clown grin flash-
ing between the tubes. We bolt-
ed through the door at last, the 
lights blinking behind us.

The trail became our friend. 

It held its own horrors: red-
neck zombies jumped out from 
behind a battered car, setting 
our 
eardrums 
ringing 
with 

blows of their shovels on metal; a 
deranged girl wailed and chased 
us, her hands grabbing at our 
ankles; a man with only half a 
body was suspended in a tree, 
screaming for help. Still, we pre-
ferred to be scared in the open 
woods, where escape was easy 
and the moon offered solace, 
rather than be trapped in dark 
haunted houses.

Survival tip number three: 

Always bring a flashlight. From 
its exterior, the final stop in the 
Terrorfied Forest looked no dif-
ferent from the other shacks we 
had walked through. We entered 
the house cautiously, tugging on 
each other’s shirts. The room 
became a narrow hallway, a 
twisting maze, growing steadily 
darker and darker. Soon it was 
pitch black; the only light came 
from the ceiling, a tiny sliver of 
moonlight, shrouded by leaves.

An eerie silence took over 

as we walked in the blackness. 
With one hand I gripped the 
shirt of the high school girl, with 
the other I skimmed the wall, 
feeling for passages and corners.

“This must be what it feels 

like to be blind,” Emma said, 
behind me. Suddenly, a loud 
smack from in front: we’d hit 
a dead end. The high school 
boy chuckled, brushing past to 
backtrack. I tried to control my 
breathing. If Harry Potter could 
make it through the Triwizard 
Maze as a 14 year old, we could 
get our adult selves out of this 
trippy house.

Finally, after what seemed 

like hours of dead ends, we 
found the back door. We spilled 
out into the moonlight, laugh-
ing about the maze and the trail, 
walking easily to the distant 
glow of the ticket booth and 
huddles of friendly faces.

Before leaving, Emma and I 

posed for a picture with one of 
the characters, holding signs 
that read, “I wet my pants at the 

Terrorfied Forest.” (Whether 
this was true or not can’t be 
disclosed.) We waved as we 
walked back to the car, thank-
ing the staff, wishing ticket 
holders good luck.

Somewhere in the woods, a 

low snarl replied.

HAUNTED FOREST
From Page 1B

Dear Gillian,
I met two great girls. One of 

them is from a different cultural 
background; the other one shares 
mine. On one hand, I like spending 
time with the 
girl 
who’s 

from 
my 

own 
culture, 

because 
it’s 

just 
familiar 

and 
natural. 

On the other 
hand, 
I’m 

crazy 
about 

this other girl. 
I fear that my 
approach to win her affection might 
be unsuitable to her cultural beliefs, 
and I really don’t want to make 
mistakes to ruin all the good feelings 
she may have for me right now. I 
don’t know how to proceed from this 
point. Idefinitely do not want to be a 
jerk who’s intentionally developing 
relationships with multiple girls, 
but I also can’t seem to make up my 
mind.

Thanks Gillian!
— Force Awaken

***

Dear Force,
Without knowing the colorful 

details of your culture differences, 
which could be as slight as East 
Coast meets Midwest or as 
momentous as East Jerusalem 
meets West Bank settler, it’s hard 
to know how to guide you. Do you 
need advice on wine selection 
(never California with an East 
Coast sweetie) or with how best to 
fry falafel? Fortunately, the liberal 
arts are overflowing with wisdom 
on your situation.

Egyptian-American playwright 

Yussef 
El 
Guindi’s 
“Pilgrims 

Musa and Sheri in the New 
World” resembles your dilemma. 
The play, which premiered in 
2011, tells the story of Musa an 
Egyptian 
immigrant 
working 

as a taxi driver in New York. 
Musa 
finds 
himself 
choosing 

between Gamila, his put-together 
and proper Muslim, Egyptian-
American fiancé, and Sheri, an 
American late-shift diner waitress 
whose conversation lacks not only 
a filter but an off button. The play 
takes place in Musa’s bedroom 
after a cab ride transitions into a 
drink at his apartment. In Musa’s 
personal pilgrimage of identity, 
Gamila represents the sensible 
and comfortable choice and Sheri 
the 
exciting 
and 
unfamiliar. 

Sages have dispensed the advice 
to “explore the unknown” since 
time immemorial; it is said to 
expand your horizons, broaden 
your perspective and alter the rest 
of your geometric assumptions. 
Beware, however, of confusing 
genuine 
affection 
with 
the 

excitement of novelty. You don’t 
want to exoticize the girl’s cultural 
identity and have it become the 
locus of your attraction, which is 
where Musa may have gone wrong.

Another pitfall to avoid is 

chasing the forbidden for its own 
sake. From Neanderthal-Homo 
Sapien hook-ups to our globalized 
world of 2015, love across ethnic, 
racial, religious or even genetic 

backgrounds 
has 
flourished 

despite being forbidden (à la Romeo 
and Juliet) or outlawed (e.g., the 
anti-miscegenation 
laws 
and 

constitutional bans on interracial 
marriage of the several states). But 
just as a book ban might briefly 
increase sales without improving 
the work, a love ban might 
manufacture temporary attraction 
without regard to its endurance. 
Make sure you don’t just want it 
because you can’t have it.

Another worry of cross-cultural 

cuddlers is that they might be 
judged by the less enlightened (As 
any bat mitzvah’d girl can attest, 
the first question out of grandma’s 
mouth when you mention your lab 
partner Jake, is: “is he Jewish?” 
often with a follow up about the 
charms of the medical profession). 
Tevye, the patriarch in “Fiddler 
on the Roof” — a book, musical 
and film set in 1904 Czarist Russia 
— like you Force, weighs his two 
options on the one hand. And on 
the other hand, when his third 
daughter, Chava, announces she 
is going to marry her Marxist-
Atheist (and in any event non-
Jewish) 
lover 
Fyedka, 
Tevye 

struggles 
between 
acceptance 

and tradition (one making for 
much a better refrain in musical 
theater). “On the other hand, our 
old ways were once new, weren’t 
they? On the other hand, they 
decided without parents. Without 
a matchmaker!” Eventually, Tevye 
runs out of hands and, despite tacit 
sympathy for her inner strength, 
cannot bring himself to accept his 
daughter’s cultural rebellion.

The 
Judeo-Christian 
God 

seemed more tolerant of marrying 
a gentile back in the good Old-
Testament days. Moses’s older 
sister Miriam questioned his 
marriage to a “Cushite woman,” 
which is translated as “Ethiopian” 
in the King James Bible. The 
woman interpreted to be his wife, 
Zipporah, is described elsewhere 
in the same way. In Numbers 12 
the scripture reads “And Miriam 
and Aaron spoke against Moses 
because of the Ethiopian woman 
whom he had married: for he had 
married an Ethiopian woman.” 
God then punishes Miriam with 
a temporary bout of leprosy for 
criticizing Moses’s decision to 
marry outside of the tribe. Take 
that, haters.

It is surely noble to be the 

one to step up and tear down 
anachronistic 
boundaries 
— 

Moses, Chava, Romeo/Juliet (OK, 
maybe not the Neanderthal …) 
not only are true to their romantic 
selves, but also advance the world’s 
progress toward tolerance and 
cross-cultural 
understanding. 

Likewise with the New York City 
Ballet’s Arthur Mitchell and Diana 
Adams, Black and white dancers, 
respectively, in the pre-civil rights 
era who kicked up a powerful stir 
entangling limbs in their intimate 
duet in Balanchine’s Agon. So 
if your Force is Awakening for 
the right reasons, you can take 
your place among the great taboo 
busters of history and the arts. But 
keep in mind, Romeo and Juliet 

killed themselves, Chava went 
to Siberia and Moses was barred 
from the Promised Land. And the 
Neanderthal is extinct.

In Zadie Smith’s novel, “NW,” 

the characters blend and layer 
an array of ethnic, racial, socio-
economic and national identities 
in an outer corner of London. A 
central character, Leah Hanwell, 
grew up poor in the North West 
neighborhood with one English 
and one Irish parent. Her husband, 
Michel, is a French man of West 
African descent who works as 
a hairdresser. In the detached 
stream of consciousness style of 
the book, Leah muses about her 
marriage in the objective third 
person as she lay with Michel in 
their bedroom. She compares their 
physical beauties (“The man is 
more beautiful than the woman”), 
touches upon the history of how 
they came together and what 
they’ve learned since: “They were 
married before they noticed many 
small differences in background, 
aspiration, education, ambition. 
There is a difference between the 
ambitions of the poor of the city 
and the poor of the country, for 
examples.” Here it was not the 
obvious differences in upbringing 
or heritage that differentiated 
Leah and Michel, but qualities and 
values that came out after knowing 
and loving each other for a while.

So, my good Force, I’d advise 

you first to read “NW,” because it’s 
a great book. Next I’d say seek to 
understand the differences between 
you and the girl who shares your 
culture and, conversely, look for 
the commonalities between you 
and your more seemingly foreign 
love interest. As Zadie shows us, 
connection is complicated. Don’t 
let initial familiarity or its opposite 
be the deciding factor, but get to 
know each on a deeper level.

As 
for 
worrying 
about 

messing up the way you go 
about courtship, FA, just be a 
keen observer and ask questions 
to learn how she interprets 
different gestures or messages. 
Guard well against pretending 
to understand her culture when 
you don’t have a superficial 
clue. Have you seen in “I Love 
Lucy,” the groundbreaking 1950s 
sitcom, when Lucy conflates 
the traditions of Mexico, Spain 
and even Brazil in her hilarious 
attempt 
to 
recreate 
Ricky’s 

happy 
boyhood 
surroundings 

in his native Cuba? Differences 
and 
misinterpretations 
make 

for great comedy, but if you end 
up with some ‘splainin’ to do, 
don’t worry: The updated emojis 
finally have faces along the full 
spectrum of skin color and iconic 
cultural references.

EPISODE REVIEW

 When Gina Rodriguez cries, 
I cry.
 Never has this been truer 
than the 
second 
season, 
which 
is as 
absurdly 
fast-paced 
as ever. In 
“Chapter 
Twenty-
Five” 
alone, 
Jane Villanueva (Gina Rodri-
guez, “Filly Brown”) prepares 
for her son’s baptism, deals 
with Petra (Yael Grobglas, 
“Reign”) getting pregnant 
from her ex-husband Rafael’s 
(Justin Baldoni, “Everwood”) 
stolen sperm and balances 
motherhood with her desire 
to go to grad school, all while 
still juggling two love inter-
ests who are impatiently wait-
ing for her to choose between 

them. Frankly, the episode is 
overstuffed.
 Still, all the convoluted 
plot mechanics melt away in 
the final scenes, when Jane 
reads a speech written by her 
grandmother Alba (Ivonne 
Coll, “Glee”). By flashing back 
to show Alba and Xo (Andrea 
Navedo, “One Life to Live”) 
each reading the speech at 
their own daughter’s bap-
tisms, the show emphasizes 
the bond that Jane shares 
with her mother and grand-
mother. It’s almost impossible 
not to tear up as Rodriguez 
cries delivering it.
 Elsewhere, the show 
remains refreshingly commit-
ting to upending drama ste-
reotypes, like keeping secrets 
hidden. When Xo pushes Rog-
elio (Jaime Camil, “The Poor, 
Rich Family”) away because 
she’s jealous of his chemistry 
with his ex-wife, Alba immedi-
ately slaps some sense into her 

and forces her not to let petty 
insecurities get in the way. 
When Rafael finds out about 
Petra’s turkey baster insemi-
nation, he tells Jane almost 
immediately, and they find a 
way forward.
 For all of the self-awareness 

and narrative efficiency that 
“Jane the Virgin” has, though, 
its real strength lies in that 
final baptism scene. Playing it 
straight and taking characters’ 
feelings seriously has rarely felt 
so honest.

The last time I met Phoebe 

Ryan I was wearing overalls, a 
Miley Cyrus shirt and a straw 
hat. Thanks to that outfit, almost 
immediately after describing my 
festival get-up from Bonnaroo 
last June, Ryan remembered 
me, grabbing my wrists in 
excitement. Today, she’s sporting 
a captain’s hat over her black-to-
green ombre hair and toting a 
ukulele as we walk downstairs 
before her sound check.

“I always have a little stringed 

instrument,” she said. “When 
I’m writing, I noodle around on 
this to figure out what melodies I 
want to use. So that’s important. 
And this captain’s hat. I wear 
it in the van, even when I’m not 
driving. I just love the look.”

Before 
creating 
her 
own 

music, Ryan wrote on tracks 
for pop artist Bea Miller and 
rapper Skizzy Mars. Her solo 
career began when she rocked 
the Internet by releasing a 
mashup of R. Kelly’s “Ignition” 
and Miguel’s “Do You ...” on her 
Soundcloud in January.

“(The 
mashup) 
kind 
of 

happened organically,” Ryan 
said. “I was experimenting with 
my producer, listening to what 
music I had listened to lately 
and we were like, ‘Why don’t we 
try this over this with this track 
and see what happens.’ It was 
really random.”

It was a random track that 

went on to garner hundreds of 
thousands of plays. Later that 
month she released her first 
original song, “Mine,” followed 
by her debut EP of the same name 
in June. Since then, she’s been 
touring consistently: opening 
for Smallpools currently, Say 
Lou Lou last month and sets 
at Bonnaroo and Firefly over 
the summer. After Smallpools’s 
American Love tour concludes 
in December, she will be headed 
back to Los Angeles to work on 
her full-length album.

“There’s already enough songs 

for a record. We have amazing 
songs done, but now we are 
trying to beat everything. We 
keep writing and writing to get 
the most songs to pick from and 
have them be the best of the 
best,” Ryan said. “It’s going to be 
a spring album, definitely. It’s a 
really fun record.”

Even on tour, Ryan is constantly 

writing for the new record.

“I have to write every single 

day, even if it’s just on a notepad, 
not a full song,” she said as she 
strummed on her ukulele. “I’ve 
got to keep my muscle memory 
going. I consider that part of 
the process because you have a 
creative muscle, and you’ve got 
to exercise it every day.”

Her songs are personal, often 

drawing from the relationships 
in life: with people, herself and 
the world. “Mine” has been 

featured on MTV, topped the 
Radio Disney charts and came 
second on Taylor Swift’s “New 
Songs That Will Make Your Life 
More Awesome” list that she 
posted on Instagram three weeks 
ago. While she doesn’t have a 
TV, she watches online when she 
knows one of her songs will be 
playing.

“It’s so weird seeing your songs 

on TV and knowing other people 
are watching. It feels so different. 
When it’s on the radio it’s just a 
song people are listening to, but 
when it’s worked into a script it 
changes it somehow, in a good 
way,” Ryan said.

And as far as her shout out 

from arguably pop music’s most 
visible artist, Ryan discovered it 
at the same time as millions of 
other fans.

“That was a complete surprise 

to me,” she said noticeably 
excited. “It was like Christmas. I 
was so honored.”

Before living in L.A., Ryan 

grew up in New Jersey by the 
shore with her parents and older 
brother, to whom she accredits 
some of her musical career. As 
a child she took piano lessons 
while her brother learned to play 
the guitar. Ryan would borrow 
her brother’s guitar and teach 
herself how to play whenever he 
wasn’t home.

“(Growing up) I was like, ‘I 

wanna play guitar. Why am I at 
the stupid piano? I want to play a 
freakin’ rock ‘n’ roll instrument,’ 
” she said. “Just being jealous of 
him made me get into music.”

But her musical education 

didn’t 
stop 
at 
stealing 
her 

brother’s guitar. She went on to 
study production and engineering 
at 
New 
York 
University’s 

prestigious Tisch School of the 
Arts (other alumni include Lady 
Gaga, Woody Allen and Angelina 
Jolie). Ryan graduated two years 
ago, and left college eager to take 
on the music industry.

“(My time at NYU) was 

awesome — it was really rad. It 
was hard because I saw all my 
friends with careers happening 
and granted they were a few 
years older than me, but I was 

just like, ‘I need to be where 
they are right now.’ I was very 
impatient, but I ended up sticking 
it out and I think it was word it,” 
she said. “My parents are happy,” 
she added with a chuckle.

Ryan’s American Love tour 

made a stop at Webster Hall 
in Manhattan’s east side this 
month. Growing up in the city, 
Ryan was just around the corner 
from Webster Hall, making the 
show one of Ryan’s favorites.

“The first year I was there I 

lived right next door. I used to go 
there for shows all the time and I 
(knew) someday, I’m going to be 
on that stage and there’s going to 
be a really big audience and it’s 
gonna rule and it happened and 
I was in shock the whole time. It 
was insane,” she said.

But that doesn’t mean she’s 

done taking on the city yet. Ryan 
has a few venues in her mind that 
she hasn’t gotten to quite yet. 
None by name, but she offered 
her praise to fellow up-and-
comer Halsey, who recently 
announced a show at Madison 
Square Garden.

Natural and confident on 

stage, it’s clear that Phoebe 
Ryan will soon be in the arena 
game. Her live show is as 
polished as her studio sound 
and she’s only got more to 
come. Seeing her about four 
months after Bonnaroo, her 
performance is more cohesive 
with her band and backup 
vocals, leaving her set with an 
enviable smoothness and she 
has deftly balanced performing 
and crowd interaction early in 
her career. Songwriting wise, 
she has songs already placed 
with artists, her favorites yet 
to come and her upcoming LP 
is sure to make a splash in pop 
music’s 2016 Spring season.

“I’ve been waking up for the 

past five years saying, ‘This is 
gonna happen, be an artist and 
kill it.’ Or at least I’m gonna try. 
I’ve been in that mindset for a 
really long time and I think that’s 
what makes me crazy enough to 
even attempt it,” Ryan said. “I’m 
so proud all the time, and truly 
the best is yet to come.”

Top costumes for 
Halloween 2015

By CARLY COLONNESE and 

JULIA DOYLE

Daily Arts Writers

It’s finally Halloween, what 

some would call the favorite 
holiday among college students, 
especially here at the University. 
Halloween is a long affair filled 
with various festivities, coupled 
with an excuse to dress up as 
something clever or scary. But 
for many others, it is an excuse 
to dress down with an extremely 
revealing costume — but we hold 
no judgments. After all, it’s all a 
part of the creativity, the humor 
and the life-long regrets that come 
with the territory of Halloween.

Halloween has a way of bring-

ing out a vibrant energy around 
the University’s campus each 
year unlike that of gamedays or 
other noteable campus events. 
For most of the world, Halloween 
lasts for one night. But for others, 
the bravest students on campus 
(some would argue), Halloween 
quickly escalates from one night of 
celebration to a full-fledged “Hal-
loweek.” People on campus always 
amaze us with their unfailing abil-
ity to brave the cold weather to go 
out each night with some new and 
undoubtedly inspired costume. 
With the costume of the current 
night always outdoing the previ-
ous, the University’s campus dur-
ing Halloween is quite the show 
for students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents alike.

Each year there are always vari-

ous costume trends among Uni-
versity students. Inspired by the 
likes of pop culture, music, classic 
films and so on, there are those 
who go all-in and conjure up an 
entirely new and unique ensem-
ble individually or with a group 
(how many Kardashian sisters do 
you think we will see on campus 
this year?). The other group of 
students, what we call the much 
less adventuresome individuals, 
tend to stick with what they have 
in their closet and simply acces-
sorize. Nothing to be ashamed of 
there, with being responsible for 
up to a week’s worth of costumes, 
it’s undoubtedly the economical 
choice. Regardless of how exciting 
and different a person’s costume is, 
there always tend to be those few 
select repeat costumes each year. 
Let’s take a look.

“The cat” … what some would 

call a college Halloween staple. 
People are attracted — and often 
default — to this look simply 
because it requires minimal effort 
in most cases. You can wear an 
entire jumpsuit with a cat-themed 
pattern on it (leopard and cheetah 
included, let your inner Cookie 
Lyon roar, people) and actually 
somewhat resemble a cat in almost 
all cases. Others take a slightly dif-
ferent approach. Some people use 
this as the excuse to strip down 
to the bare minimum of clothing 
(with Michigan weather, you folks 
deserve an award), slap some cat 
ears on their head and call it a cos-
tume. Regardless of which way a 
person goes with this, I guarantee 
we will see more than a few. We 
rate this here at Daily Style as a 
more than acceptable costume — 
just don’t expect the likes of Heidi 
Klum to gush over it anytime soon.

“Britney” … another college/

life/teenage girl classic. Each year 
we are left in awe not just at how 
many people go for the Britney 
Spears look, but also how people 
differentiate each one of Britney’s 
many stages of life. Some people 
will go with a group of girlfriends, 
with each girl mimicking one of 
Britney’s 
wide-ranging 
looks. 

From the jean on jean, to the 
Catholic school uniform, to the 
inevitable bald caps, there really 
is no way to go wrong. Oh baby, 
baby, we aren’t sure whether Brit-
ney’s PR team deserves an award 
or a stiff drink, because this pop 
star seems to be providing more 
than enough content to keep girls 
and boys alike set in the costume 
department for days.

“Football Player” … being the 

football school that we are (Yes, 
MSU, we still are aMazing), this 
is yet another look that students 
cannot stay away from. Yet again, 
the simplicity of the outfit is why 
we believe its popularity has never 
faltered. All one has to do is find a 
jersey, find tight pants (or no pants 
in many cases), and put some eye 
black on. It’s easy, quick and will 

always be universally and Univer-
sity relevant.

This year, we expect to see 

many of the same looks. While we 
love to see uniqueness, we have 
stopped getting our hopes up. But 
then again, bald Britney is always 
a crowd pleaser. The truth is, with 
the wide variety of costumes actu-
ally on the market, students have 
no excuse to be wearing the same 
costume as anyone else.

Ragstock, a vintage and used 

clothing store that opened in 
October of 2010, has become 
downtown Ann Arbor’s center 
for Halloween costume shop-
ping, with the biggest appeal to 
students. With hundreds of cos-
tume options, accessories and 
individual pieces needed for the 
perfect Halloween costume, it 
would be hard to leave empty-
handed this time of year. Rag-
stock offers the inventory giving 
every student, lazy or inspired, 
a chance to find a unique and 
Insta-worthy 
look. 
Students 

flock to the store in troves when-
ever the holidays come around, 
whether they’re in need for Hal-
loween costumes or ugly Christ-
mas sweaters. We can rest easy 
knowing that Ragstock will 
never fail to provide whatever 
bizarre, outfit-completing piece 
a person may need.

“Here Halloween is like our 

Christmas; it’s our busiest day of 
the year,” said Ragstock employ-
ee Elaine, an Eastern Michigan 
University student. Due to the 
prevalence of Halloween cul-
ture on the University’s cam-
pus, Elaine discussed how the 
store gets overwhelmingly busy 
during the Halloween season. 
Students, ridden with midterms 
and the like during these weeks, 
will often come in last minute, 
leaving the store flooded with 
students, especially during the 
week of Halloween. People will 
come in groups for their friends’ 
input or to focus alone, each 
looking for that perfect outfit.

Elaine said that the store 

starts prepping for Halloween 
in the last weeks of September 
because there are still those 
ever-prepared people who are 
ready to get the ball rolling for 
Halloween just a little bit earlier 
than the rest of us.

Given that some people choose 

to accessorize rather than buy a 
full costume, Ragstock is pre-
pared for both. Although both 
are popular, Elaine believes the 
majority of people come in look-
ing for accessorizing pieces, 
rather than the whole look.

“They buy both. More popular 

are accessories because we have 
so many unique things. They 
come in with something really 
specific for a unique costume 
that they’re doing.”

For those Halloween enthusi-

asts who find themselves bom-
barded with exams with just 
a bit of light gleaming at the 
end of the tunnel in the form of 
Halloween festivities, we have 
got you covered. If the popular 
costumes among students bore 
you, or if you are looking to the 
bigger picture of relevance and 
Halloween legendary-ness, then 
look no further. Lucky for you, 
2015 has had plenty of Hallow-
een-costume-worthy events.

1. Donald Trump
This 
reality 
star-turned-

GOP presidential candidate has 
gained serious attention in the 
media, good and bad, making 
him a perfect Halloween cos-

tume. Just imagine the blonde 
wig you can buy for this.

2. Caitlyn Jenner
Jenner’s iconic Vanity Fair 

cover has already gathered an 
abundance of media attention. 
While this extremely controver-
sial costume can be construed 
as being offensive toward the 
transgender community, Jenner 
has publicly said that she doesn’t 
have an issue with the costume. 
Let’s be honest though, how 
many people can look as good as 
she did on that cover?

3. “Love Wins”
In light of the U.S. Supreme 

Court ruling on June 26, legalizing 
same sex marriage in all 50 states, 
this can be a positive, fun costume 
on the historical ruling. Bright 
colors and rainbows everywhere, 
people.

4. Miley Cyrus
After “Wrecking Ball” took 

Halloween by storm in 2013, 
Cyrus is the artist that keeps on 
giving great ideas and moments 
for Halloweens for years to come. 
The 2015 Miley Cyrus thoroughly 
enjoyed showing plenty of skin 
and, frankly, bizarre outfit choices. 
Seek inspiration from one of her 10 
outfits from the VMAs.

5. Kylie Jenner
This freshly legal “famous” 

person is always at the forefront 
of entertainment news. Break out 
your shot glass and do the Kylie 
Jenner Lip Challenge, add some 
black or blue lipstick and your cos-
tume is complete.

6. Stephen Curry and daugh-

ter Riley Curry

The Internet went crazy after 

videos of Riley surfaced being, 
well, a boss-child, at a press con-
ference. You come up with the rest.

7. “Fifty Shades of Grey”
The excitement that came with 

this book wasn’t enough to mask 
the pure horror that came from 
watching the movie. However, 
this can be your opportunity for an 
exceptionally punny costume, as 
all one needs to wear is a multitude 
of gray colored clothing and maybe 
some leather …

8. Left Shark
It’s weird to look way back on 

the Super Bowl because it feels 
like forever ago at this point, but 
hey, it’s still 2015. Left Shark took 
the world by storm after botch-
ing his dance moves in “Teenage 
Dream.” Memes galore and GIFs 
followed suit. Be creative, be you, 
become the Left Shark.

9. Chanel from “Scream 

Queens”

Emma Roberts plays a fash-

ionably bitchy (scary similar 
to her character in “American 
Horror Story Coven”) soror-
ity president named Chanel in 
ABC’s “Scream Queens.” She’s 
known for wearing immaculate 
outfits that are always acces-
sorized with fur. This can be 
especially fun as she has min-
ions, Chanel #1, Chanel #2 
(dead), Chanel #3, Chanel #4 
(dead), Chanel #5 and Chanel 
#6. Sorry for the spoilers, but 
just think of the #squadgoals 
outfits that can come as a result 
of this?!

10. “American Horror Story”
It is Halloween after all; 

“AHS Freak Show” and “Hotel” 
have scary and interesting char-
acters alike. With more than 10 
million viewers of the FX series, 
these haunting, gory costumes 
would surely be a hit. We never 
thought we would say this, but 
we give you all full permission 
to channel your inner Gaga.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 I stand by my accurate, private 
and irrelevant theory that a col-
lege student in her final year 
of studies 
can draw an 
immediate 
comparison of 
her collected 
experiences 
and growth 
to that of the 
rambunctious Justin Bieber. I’m 
speaking to you especially, Class 
of 2016, who has aged with the 
beloved Mr. Biebs. Remember 
when you were lying on the 
bathroom floor of Markley at 3 
a.m., just moments after vomit-
ing? Bieber was, concurrently, 
performing some comparably 
dumb scenario, like pissing 
publicly in some backstage mop 
bucket. From there, the size and 
breadth of the mistakes and suc-
cesses made by both parties only 
grew. You failed however many 
tests (hopefully not that many) 
and Bieber collected ticket after 
ticket on that lovely yellow Lam-
borghini. Together the Class of 
2016 and Bieber have drank too 
much and, subsequently, made 
some fairly wretched decisions. 
They were never life altering, 
but for both parties, they came 
pretty close.
 We’ve been with him 
through it all: from the pre-

pubescent, floppy haired, 
Ludacris-laced days of “Baby” 
to the excessively popular 
“Deport Bieber” petitions 
to the matured post-Selena 
Bieber. Modern Bieber, 
still undeniably sexy and 
vaguely feminine, positioned 
himself as a pop star with 
enough taste and humility 
to place two New Zealand 
dance crews, ReQuest and 
Royal Family Mega Crew, 
in the dance video for his 
most recent single, “Sorry.” 
Clothed in fluorescents remi-
niscent of some deliciously 
trippy ’80s explosion, New 
Zealand’s finest dancers 
present sets of mesmerizing 
choreography that lets no 

bodacious body go unnoticed. 
Perfectly on par to every 
single one of the song’s heavy 
bass beats, the dancers keep 
all eyes glued to the screen. 
Polka-dotted, spectacled, 
red-lipped and monochro-
matically dressed, each of the 
dancers is uniquely dressed 
in what will surely become 
someone’s last minute Hal-
loween costume.
 Bieber’s decision to remove 
his physical self from the 
“Sorry” dance video is some 
sort of calculated brilliance. Not 
only does he appear less eager 
to the public, but his music now 
assumes a versatility that tran-
scends his previous work.

Passionate, precise 
Tenebrae choir in A2

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

During Holy Week before 

Easter Sunday, Tenebrae is a 
ceremony in Catholic and sev-
eral 
Protes-

tant 
liturgies 

in which cer-
emonial candles 
are 
gradually 

extinguished on 
Good Friday to 
symbolize 
the 

death of Christ. 
For Nigel Short, 
English 
choir 

singer 
and 

director, the memories of church 
ritual and music as a young choir 
boy inspire a singing career that 
has 
spanned 
decades. 
Short 

retired from singing in 2001 to 
found the world-renowned choir, 
Tenebrae, who will appear at St. 
Francis of Assisi Church in Ann 
Arbor through University Musi-
cal Society.

“I started the choir in 2001, 

mainly because I have adored 
choral singing and choral music 
since the age of seven,” Short 
said in a phone interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “I started 
singing in my local church choir. 
I was completely mesmerized by 

everything about it. I just turned 
up at the medieval church, and I 
heard these boys singing and it 
went into my soul.”

Tenebrae is a virtuoso choir 

of about 20 singers whose reper-
toire spans five centuries. From 
the 16th to the 21st century, from 
sacred music to secular, Tene-
brae’s mission is to bring music of 
universally beautiful and acces-
sible music to audiences under 
the watchwords: “Passion & Pre-
cision.”

Joining their musical rigor 

with movement and light, Tene-
brae thoughtfully elaborates on 
their music with a kind of theatri-

cality that alerts audience mem-
bers to the concert space and its 
acoustics, and discourages a stat-
ic divide between performance 
and audience. This decision pro-
vides audiences with a “fresh 
perspective” on liturgical music 
and early music.

“As a choir boy, my favorite 

services were the ones where we 
would sing by candlelight and we 
would move around,” Short said.

But where movement or light 

could detract from the group’s 
precision, Short opts against it.

“It has to be pretty sensitive 

and very effective,” he said.

Short explained his inspiration 

to incorporate light and move-
ment comes from his apprecia-
tion of those elements in his choir 
activity as a young person in a 
“medieval church.” In Tenebrae, 
you have an evocation of a likely 
old, monastic practice of inte-
grating movement and light that 
disrupts conventions and expec-
tations. Through their secular-
ized appeal to Christian ritual, 

Tenebrae’s “fresh perspective” 
crafts an image of monastic rigor 
and intimacy for audiences who 
might not necessarily have any 
religious experience.

For Short, the “passion” is 

inseparable from the “precision” 
even at the level of program cura-
tion. While some programs will 
be organized around a theme, 
Short mainly arranges them 
according to the degree of focus 
necessary, with concerts cul-
minating in the most virtuosic 
pieces.

“We kind of try to get our-

selves into a zone, if you like, in 
terms of concentration and focus. 
And we try to take the audience 
with us,” Short said. “Within that 
sequence, there can be anything. 
There can be secular music, it 
can be very fast, energetic or 
it can just be beautifully soft, 
smooth, serene, ethereal, heav-
enly sounds that people can just 
lose themselves in and be trans-
ported by. The themes can vary 
hugely.”

Tenebrae is a group that 

believes wholly in music as a 
transformative force. Presenting 
their selections with enthusiasm 
and technical perfection, Tene-
brae celebrates music as a univer-
sal communion which Ann Arbor 
audiences will have the opportu-
nity to see later this week.

“I don’t think that the aspect 

of making music accessible to 
an audience or choosing music 
that is accessible, or what can be 
described as accessible,” Short 
said, “has ever really appeared on 
my horizon.”

Tenebrae’s 

music spans the 
sacred and the 

secular.
