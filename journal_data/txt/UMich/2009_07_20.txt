U' construction forecast

Regents approve
renovations for
Couzens, UMHS
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
DailyNewsEditor
At the University Board of
Regents monthly meeting on
Thursday, the regents reviewed
and approved five construction
projects involving a University res-
idence hall, hospital, museum and
science building. The projects total
$60.66 million in renovations.
APPROVAL OF SCHEMATIC
DESIGN FOR COUZENS
RESIDENCE HALL
The Board of Regents approved
renovationstotheschematic design
of Couzens Residence Hall, which
will include updates and repairs to
the building's infrastructure.
Additions include new plumb-
ing, heating, ventilation, fire
detection and high-speed Internet
access. Improvements will also be
made to residents' rooms and bath-
rooms.
The currently vacant dining
room and kitchen will be turned
into space designated for living-
learning communities, classrooms
and academic offices.
New energy conservation initia-
tives will be implemented by add-
ing insulation to exterior walls,

replacing windows and installing
energy-efficient heating and air
conditioning systems.
Couzens Residence Hall opened
in 1925 with 260 female students.
Today, the dormitory houses 560
male and female students.
The renovation is estimated to
cost $49 million and will be funded
by University Housing and invest-
ment proceeds. Couzens will close
and renovations will begin in spring
2010, andconstructionis scheduled
to be completed in summer 2011.
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL'S
CENTRAL STERILE SUPPLY AREA
EXPANSION
The University Hospital will
be expanded by approximately
16,000-square-feet. The renova-
tion will add space for the central
sterile supply area on level B2 and
will accommodate the increasing
amount of instrumentation that
requires sterilization.
The estimated cost of the con-
struction is $6.9 million. It will
be funded by University Hospitals
and Health Centers. The expan-
sion is scheduled to be completed
in winter 2012.
Alexander G. Ruthven Museums
Building fire detection and alarm
system installation
A fire detection and alarm sys-
tem will be installed in the Alex-
ander Ruthven Museums Building.
The technology will meet current
codes and standards.

The installation of the fire
detection and alarm system will
cost about $2.4 million and will be
funded by investment proceeds.
The project is scheduled to be com-
pleted in summer 2010.
CANCER CENTER INFUSION
EXPANSION
The Cancer Center's infusion
area will be expanded by approxi-
mately 1,000 square feet. The
added space will accommodate
patients receiving longer infu-
sion treatments. The project will
improve the center's patient capac-
ity by 13 percent.
The renovation is estimated
to cost $1.16 million and will be
funded by University Hospitals
and Health Centers. Construction
is scheduled to be completed in
winter 2010.
ADDITION TO THE CLARENCE
COOK LITTLE SCIENCE BUILDING
Approximately 7,300-square-
feet will be added to the Clarence
Cook Little Science Building to
provide research space for new
faculty in the Department of Geol-
ogy. An existing laboratory suite
will also be updated.
The renovation will cost about
$1.2 million and will be funded
by the College of Literature, Sci-
ence and the Arts. The project
is scheduled to be completed in
spring 2010.

From Page 1
The report stated that many fac-
ulty and retirees have realized a
loss of net worth due to the down-
turn in the real estate market, while
the faculty and retirees who live in
Ann Arbor may have to pay higher
property taxes because of the loss of
$8 million in real estate taxes that
Pfizer Inc. had paid before it sold its
property on North Campus to the
University. At the same time, many
faculty members are coping with
losses to their retirement accounts,
Askari said.
Despite the economic challenges
University employees face, Askari
cited the Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation's survey, which labeled the
University as one of the "best places
to work."

Obama goes back to college
Congress should support plan to improve community colleges
Community colleges are colleges, too. While it may be easy to
forget that fact at a large research university, President Barack
Obama recently announced a plan that recognizes the impor-
tance of community colleges. He's proposing a 10-year, $12-billion invest-
ment in community colleges to improve their ability to educate America's
workforce. The plan, called the American Graduation Initiative, sends a
message from the Obama administration that it hasn't forgotten about
those for whom a bachelor's degree at a four-year university isn't a real-
istic possibility. It's Congress's job to reinforce Obama's admirable com-
mitment to community colleges by passing the initiative.

At least 62 convicted but acci-
dentally released sex offenders
walked free on Michigan streets
for days between May 22 and 24.
Due to misclassifications dur-
ing their release evaluations, the
prisoners were released without
enrollment in a parole program.
Some of the prisoners may have
been ready for release, but others
may have been recommended for
further observation before their
release. Though it's being por-
trayed as an innocent mistake, the
accidental release of these prison-
ers illustrates the danger of Gov.
Jennifer Granholm's proposed
early release program.
To cut down inmate popula-
tion, Granholm initiated a plan
to release prisoners once their
minimum sentence had been
completed. While saving money is
a laudable goal, if the actual result
is the repeated bungling of pris-
oner releases, this plan becomes
a serious danger to the state's
residents. When the Department
of Corrections's incompetence
allows a security breach like this,
the safety of innocent, unknowing
residents is at stake.
The releases in question were
the result of two psychologists
misclassifying thesesexual pred-
ators in a fourth category, instead
of one of the three expected
categories - parole, outpatient
or inpatient. And while the sex
offenders were returned to prison
within a few days after their acci-
dental release, it was clear that
in the days between the events,
no one in the Department of Cor-
rections knew what was going on.
When asked, officials gave vary-
ing numbers for how many pris-
oners had been released.
Thesesexual predators were
free for days. Though they were
wearing electronic tethers that
were being monitored, they were
not enrolled in any sort of parole
program. And as far as I know, a
tether that alerts officials when a
child molester approaches a child
hasn't been invented yet.
The released sex offenders
weren't people convicted of some
controversial statutory rape charg-
es. They ranged from child molest-
ers to rapists. And they walked
freely down the streets for days.
According to the Department
of Corrections, these rapists and
molesters didn't commit any addi-
tional crimes while released. But
it's unclear on what grounds this
conclusion was reached. Less than

40 percent of all rapes were report-
ed in 2003, according to the U.S.
Department of Justice, and this
number is even lower for attempt-
ed rapes. Less than 20 percent of
molested adolescents tell an adult,
accordingtothe 1995 National Sur-
vey of Adolescents. If any of these
scumbags tried to force themselves
on someone else, chances are good
the assault remains unreported.
Victims of sexual assault are
afraid of their attackers. And those
brave enough to fight to have their
attackers put in prison deserve the
satisfaction of some sense of safety.
There's even a website that allows
victims in Michigan to track the
status of their assailant. The dis-
tress that the victims of the 62
released predators must have felt is
unimaginable. Knowing there was
nothing but an electronic tether
between them and their worst
nightmare could have had horrible
psychological effects onthem. And
that's not taking into account the
possibility of new victims.
tn 1995, astudyfrom theNation-
al Survey of Adolescents found
that 13 percentofgirls and 3.4 per-
cent of boys had been molested.
And about 17.6 percent of women
have beensexuallyassaulted, with
the percentage hovering between
20 and 25 for college co-eds,
according to a 2006 Department
of Justice survey. These numbers
are staggering. The last thing
this country needs is to see those
numbers rise. And if "innocent
mistakes" like this prison release
start happening frequently, that is
easily what could happen.
Surprisingly, Republicans in
the state House of Representa-
tives seem to be the only ones
making noise over this incident.
They are calling for the elimina-
tion of the program. But surely
there should be more outrage
over the release of at least 62
depraved men. If the released
prisoners had been murderers,
wouldn't there be more anger?
People place their trust in
the Department of Corrections
to keep perverts behind bars.
Thanks to the carelessness of
two psychiatrists and the disor-
ganization of the Michigan pris-
on system, the department has
failed. Until failures like this one
are eliminated, Granholm's early
release program has to be tabled.
It's not worth the risk.

* THUMBS DOWN
Starting the accident that
melted and collapsed the 9
Mile Road bridge over 1-75.

Obama announced the initia-
tive on Tuesday at Macomb Com-
munity College in the nearby
Detroit suburb of Warren, a blue-
collar town hit hard by the recent
economic meltdown. Obama
proposed a number of methods
that would improve community
colleges nationwide by helping
them provide online courses and
modernize facilities. The AGI
pledges to make earning an asso-
ciate's degree easier. It encourag-
es merit-based scholarships and
classes that work around full-
time schedules. Obama's goal is
an additional 5 million associate
degrees by 2020. The AGI will
be funded by an elimination of
subsidies the federal government
pays to banks that run student
loan programs, which Obama
proposed in April.
Now it's Congress's turn to fol-
low Obama's initiative and make
it happen - because Obama
was right when he said that jobs
requiring a college degree would

grow faster than jobs that don't.
This is especially true for Michi-
gan. As the state loses its manu-
facturing base, its future will
depend on job growth in fields
that require college degrees.
But getting a college degree to
enter a new profession isn't easy
for workers who've already been
in the manufacturing workforce
for years and can't afford to go
to school full time. And it isn't
easy for students whose fami-
lies have been hit hard by the
economic downturn and can't
afford a four-year degree. With
college tuition rising across the
country, the need for quality
community colleges is greater
than ever. Community colleges
could offer affordable school-
ing for people who need it - and
Obama's AGI could drastical-
ly improve the quality of this
affordable education.
Community colleges provide
essential educational oppor-
tunities and ensure that our

workforce can change with the
demand for jobs. And improving
the accessibility of community
colleges will help this happen.
Giving tools for community col-
leges to design programs around
work schedules and provide
online courses will help students
already in the workforce. The
option to train for a job in a high-
growth field while maintaining
a full-time job will entice more
to take advantage of this oppor-
tunity. And since the federal
government is paying for these
improvements, community col-
leges will be able to keep their
tuition low - something that all
universities need to do better.
Community colleges provide
an education for people who
can't afford a four-year college
education. Obama's new plan to
bolster such important institu-
tions could help bring the nation
out of this economic slump, and
Congress should ensure this
becomes reality.

Not buying it


It wan a sad day last Sunday
when I got rid of my '97 Buick
Ultra. My dad and older
brotherhadboth
driven it before
me. The breaks
always squeaked
no matter how
often I replaced
the pads, and
the right mir-
ror hung off the JEREMY
side from whenL
I accidentally LEVY
hit the garage.
Every time I brought the car to
the shop for an oil change, the
mechanics informed me that there
were several things wrong with it.
I had dealt with these problems
for four years, and it was finally
time to let go.
So my parents and I became car
buyers during a recession, when
the auto industry has been the
focal point of many discussions
about economic recovery. This
raised a tough question. Were we
in some way obligated to buy a car
manufactured in America? This
question would be absurd to an
economist. In a competitive mar-
ket, consumers are expected to act
in their own interest. But with so
much talk about the need to fix the
auto industry, someone has to buy
those American-made cars, right?
Perhaps. But it's not the con-
sumer's problem to worry about.
The economy just doesn't work
the way human reasoning does.
In single producer-to-consumer
transactions, our sense of social
responsibility shouldn't matter.
Even if I have the intention to help
the economy, my single transac-
tion will hardly make a difference.
The best thingI can do is buy acar
that fits my own needs, and the
aggregate demand of all the con-
sumers in the market will signal to
manufacturers what kind of car to
make. After all, an economy's fun-
damental purpose is to serve its
consumers. Consumers shouldn't
have to focus on how to serve the
economy.
And if American car companies
reallywantconsumerstostartbuy-
ing their cars, they need to offer
more eco-friendly options. Eco-
friendly vehicles are the cars that
are selling. The Toyota dealers in
my area actually had a waitlist to
test drive the Prius, a hybrid that
gets about 51 miles to the gallon.

Of course, this isn't news to any
of the car companies. Last year,
all the major auto manufacturers
scaled back their production of
pickups and SUVs. And even after
filing for bankruptcy, it seems that
General Motors still considers the
production of the Chevrolet Volt
its most important project. GM
hopes that the completely electric
car, due out in Nov. 2010, will give
the hybrids a run for their money.
Until then, the Prius will continue
to be in high demand.
But it makes sense that some-
one without much of a background
in economics (i.e. me) could think
otherwise. Media discussions sur-
rounding General Motors's busi-
ness decisions - its assets, loans
and investments - usually make
no sense to me. Such confusion,
fueled by constant reminders that
consumer confidence is low, causes
me to feel absentmindedly guilty.
For that reason, the thought of
buying a car from a foreign manu-
facturer seemed wasteful.
You shouldn't
feel compelled to
buy American.
But it wasn't wasteful. The best
choice for my family was to buy a
foreign car - the Honda Insight.
The new hybrid isn't quite as
fuel-efficient as the Toyota Prius
(which is actually manufactured
in the United States), but it was
about $10,000 cheaper at the
dealership I bought it from. The
Insight was also more pleasant to
drive than the Ford Fusion. The
only thing I remember from that
test drive was the loud turn blink-
er and engine.
I understand that the Ameri-
can car companies are in trouble,
but it's their responsibility to
cater to the market demand - not
the other way around. After four
years of the Buick, I was ready
for a car that fit my interests and
I needed a compelling reason to
go against them. Unless I knew it
would directly benefit the econo-
my, I wasn't going to buy another
"old-man-mobile."

A vice's virtues

P erhaps no political fig-
ure since Richard Nixon
has been as universally
despised as former Vice President
Dick Cheney.
Malevolent
puppet mas-
ter to some,
the spawn of
Satan to others, ;
Cheney's strong
will, conserva-
tive mind and CHRIS
terrific scowl KOSLOWSKI
sealed the Bush
administra-
tion as the worst eight years in
many liberals' lives. Despite being
plagued by health problems and
political attacks from the Left,
Cheney still refuses to ride off into
the sunset. He was recently found
to be involved in the cover-up of a
secret CIA counter-terrorism pro-
gram while he was vice president.
Cheney's been a hero of mine for
years. Here are the top six reasons
why you should love him, too.
6. He knows how tofight.
During George H.W. Bush's
presidency, Cheney served as
Secretary of Defense. Along with
General Norman Schwarzkopf, he
was the mastermind behind Oper-
ation Desert Storm, the military
strike that removed invadingIraqi
forces from Kuwait faster than
you can say, "Elite Republican
Guard." Less than four days after
U.S. forces led a ground assault
supported by the United Nations,
Saddam Hussein's troops were
high-tailing it back to Baghdad.
5. He might be immortal.
It's fitting that Cheney has
thwarted every one of his heart's
attempts to kill him - the man has
survived four heart attacks. After
several surgeries, including qua-
druple bypass and angioplasty,
Cheney received an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator - or
ICD - in 2001. The device is
meant to shock Cheney's heart

back into normal rhythm if he
suffers a sudden arrhythmia.
4. He is Darth Vader.
As Obi-Wan Kenobi said of
Darth Vader in the "Star Wars:
Return of the Jedi," "He's more
machine now than man; twisted
and evil." The association between
Cheney and the treacherous Sith
Lord began soon after his ICD
surgery. Like Vader, Cheney was
a right-hand man that struck fear
into the hearts of enemies of Bush's
Evil Galactic Empire. Cheney even
joked about being Lord Vader at
the Washington Radio and Tele-
vision Correspondents' Dinner in
2008. He had asked his wife if the
comparison bothered her, to which
she responded, "No. It humanizes
you." Now compare Cheney to Joe
Biden - President Barack Obama's
bumbling, gaffing vice president
who somehow got elected to the
U.S. Senate. If Cheney is Darth
Vader, then Biden is Jar Jar Binks.
3. He's got a soft side.
Conquering the galaxy hasn't
gotten in the way of Cheney's
family life. He's been married
to his high school sweetheart,
Lynne, for almost 45 years. They
have two daughters, Elizabeth
and Mary, and six grandchildren.
When Mary's homosexuality
became an issue in the 2004 pres-
idential campaign, Cheney stood
by his daughter despite pressure
to denounce her lifestyle. He
continues to support the right of
state governments to legalize gay
marriage to this day.
2. He shot hisfriend in theface
- and got an apologyfor it.
In Feb. 2006, Cheney made his
most infamous headline after he
accidentally shot Harry Whitting-
ton, a friend and campaign con-
tributor, while quail hunting. The
78-year-old Whittington recovered
quickly, buthe surprised many dur-
ing his first address to the media
after being discharged from the
hospital. Whittington said, "My

family and Iare deeply sorry for all
that Vice President Cheney has had
to go through this past week. We
send our love and respect to them
as they deal with situations that
are much more serious than what
we've had this week." Whittington
actually admitted that the media
assault Cheney suffered after the
incident was more difficult than
enduring a barrage of birdshot.
Most impressive.
1. He's still relevant.
Continuing the trend of recent
vice presidents, Cheney's influence
has grown since he left office. He's
one of the most vocal critics of the
Obama administration. He's spo-
ken out against Obama's economic
policies and his handling of the
war on terrorism. He has been out
of the White House for months,
but many people still ,consider
Cheney public enemy number one.
The latest accusation against him
recently made the news. It involves
the potential illegality of Cheney
not informing Congress of a mys-
terious, recently terminated CIA
counter-terrorism program that
began eight years ago.
Dick Cheney is
Darth Vader.
And I like it.
Even if you hate Dick Cheney,
admit it - you actually love to
hate Dick Cheney. He's either the
perfect hero or the perfect villain.
From his wise-ass smirk in his
official White House photo to the
black fedora he sported at Obama's
inauguration, he's impossible to
forget. Like Lord Vader, he'll go
down in history as one of our most
beloved antagonists.

vehicle.
For Van Cise, having so many
opportunities to learn was vital
in allowing him to grow person-
ally.
"There are so many enablers
on campus for people to be able
to develop themselves and be
exposed to so many different
opportunities," Van Cise said.
After graduation, NASA
hired Van Cise full-time in
2000. Prior to his promotion
to flight director, Van Cise had
worked for numerous depart-
ments, performing tasks such
as space station maintenance
training and working as a flight
controller.
Currently, Dina Contella
and Scott Stover - two other
new flight directors - are join-
ing Van Cise in preparing for
their new roles in Mission Con-
trol. All three candidates are
undergoing a rigorous training
schedule of classes and simu-
lations that lasts nine to 10
months.
John McCullough, chief
of the Flight Director Office,
wrote in a statement that NASA
officials are enthused for the
incoming class of flight direc-
tors.
"This is a very strong class
with senior flight controllers
who have an average of 10 years
of flight control experience
and nearly two years of group
lead management experience,"
McCullough said.
But for now, though, Van Cise
is looking toward the future
while remaining appreciative of
the work that got him where he
is today. Becoming flight direc-
tor had been Van Cise's long-
term goal before he was hired
at NASA, and he credits his atti-
tude in helping him reach this
point.
"My philosophy is if you're not
having fun doing what you're
doing, then you're not going to
be successful at it longterm," he
said. "I've really tried to shape
my career so that I'm enjoying
what I'm doing, yet always kind
of going towards that long term
objective."

ENROLLLMENT
From Page 1
we had to admit more students to
get to it," she said.
According to Ted Spencer, asso-
ciate vice provost and executive
director of the Office of Under-
graduate Admissions, this year's
decrease in yield - the percent-
age of applicants offered admis-
sion that send in deposits - is not
unique to the University. Many
colleges and universities across
the nation are seeing similar
trends, possibly in light of the
economy.
"The Office of Financial Aid also
is working very hard, in response
to the current economy, to get
financial aid dollars into the hands
of students and their families who
need them, and to meet the full
demonstrated financial need of all
in-state students who are offered
admission," Spencer said.
The budget passed by the Uni-
versity Board of Regents for the
2009-2010 academic year includes
the largest increase in financial
aid to date.
Pamela Fowler, executive direc-
tor of the office of Financial Aid,
wrote in a University Record
article published last week that in

applied to the University than
ever but yield has decreased, the
University is trying to provide an
affordable education to its many
qualified applicants.
"The university's 2009-10 gen-
eral fund budget includes $118
million dollars in centrally funded
financial aid, a $10 million-dollar
increase over last year," Fowler
wrote. "Thisincludes$73.7million,
an 11.7-percent rise, in centrally
awarded financial aid available to
undergraduate students. We are
doing everything we can to put
those dollars in the hands of stu-
dents and their families who need
it."
Fowler wrote in an e-mail inter-
view July 13 that the increase in
financial aid available to under-
graduate students yields a maxi-
mum amount of $1,700 in grant
aid that an individual student
may receive for 2009-2010, which
exceeds the increase in tuition and
housing for incoming freshmen by
approximately $600.
In addition, Fowler wrote that
the University is adjusting finan-
cial aid packages to include more
students from families that have
been adversely affected by the
economic crisis by increasing the
number of students eligible for
Pell Grant awards by 3 percent and

eligible for University institutional
grant funds by 12 percent.
According to Lester Monts,
senior vice provost of academic
affairs, the University administra-
tion is also ensuring the most qual-
ified applicants from this year's
large pool will be able to afford to
come to the University.
"The interest of so many highly
qualified applicants continues to
be gratifying to the University
community," Monts wrote in the
University Record article. "Equal-
ly important is the compelling
need to be sure the University of
Michigan is financially accessible.
"We have aggressively raised
substantial contributions from
alumni and friends to support
financial aid. This has allowed us
to consistently increase student
aid to unprecedented levels, well
above any rises in tuition. And we
have a longstanding commitment
to meet the full demonstrated
financial need of students who
are residents of the state of Michi-
gan."
This year the University saw an
increase in applicants from within
Michigan. According to Spencer,
63 percent of all prospective fresh-
men who applied were Michigan
residents - up from 59 percent
last year.

number of applications from
Michigan-resident students, and
proportionally more in-state stu-
dents have been offered admission
this year (63 percent) over lastyear
(59 percent)," Spencer wrote in an
e-mail interview. "At the same
time, we received fewer applica-
tions from non-residents."
Spencer wrote that the Univer-
sity doesn't know whether or not
the economy played a role in stu-
dents' enrollment decisions.
"The degree to which the econ-
omy may have been a factor in
the student's decision to attend
college is yet to be determined,"
he said. "At this point, we do not
have enough trend data to make an
accurate assumption."
Spencer also wrote that the
University tries to set the under-
graduate population at 26,000 stu-
dents, which is another factor that
determines the size of incoming
classes.
This year marks the second
admissions cycle since the pas-
sage of Proposal 2, a 2006 ballot
initiative that prohibited race and
gender from being considered in
admissions decisions. The number
of applications from women rose
to 14,628 this year, an increase of
71 from the last cycle. Of all female
applicants admitted, 3,218 paid the

of 164 compared to last year.
The number of applications
from underrepresented minorities
- interpreted as African Ameri-
cans, Hispanic Americans and
Native Americans - also increased
this year. Of the 2,879 underrepre-
sented minority applicants - up
100 from last year - 1,422 were
offered admission, which is an
increase of 102 from the previous
year. But despite the increase in
offers of admission, the yield has
decreased, following the overall
trend. So far, the University has
received 580 deposits from under-
represented minority applicants
as opposed to 638 at this time last
year.
Spencer wrote that University
administrators strive to maintain
enrollment numbers by encour-
aging admitted students to attend
the University.
"We proactively reach out to
admitted students to encourage
them to choose Michigan and,
ultimately, enroll in classes by Fall
Term," Spencer said. "President
Mary Sue Coleman, some members
of her leadership team, University
staff, faculty, current students,
alumni and friends of the Univer-
sity all join this effort every year."

The statement

"Is that a horcrux in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"
Half- decent'Prie'

By BRIGID KILCOIN
DailyArts Writer
State Street passersby peering
through the glass windows of the
University of Michigan Museum
of Art's Frankel Wing will be
struck by the sight of knit sweat-
ers emblazoned with bold slogans,
seemingly suspended in midair.
The exhibit, which is free to the
public and lasts until Oct. 11, is a
melding of two separate projects
by California-based artist Lisa
Anne Auerbach, best known for
her inventive work in the textile
arena. Her hand-knit sweaters
are the focal point of the exhibit,

which is also supplemented by
her photographs of free-standing
small businesses.
"I'm interested in the sweater as
a medium for language," Auerbach
wrote in an e-mail interview. "Text
has a different resonance when it
is literally part of the fabric."
Auerbach's sweaters deal with
current political and cultural
issues, essentially making wear-
able statements about American
culture and the world at large.
"Art explores viewpoints, ideas
and alternative realities, and in
that way, it can certainly. affect
change," Auerbach wrote. "I do

ter" movies, the
sixth effort still
doesn't match the original charm of

the book on which it's based.
In "Half-Blood Prince," Harry
Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione
Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron
Weasley (Rupert Grint), the central
cast of the past five "Harry Potter"
movies, encounter a situation where
there is no safe place in the wizard-
ing or muggle world. Not even the
seemingly impervious Hogwarts is
free from the danger that a restored
Lord Voldemort presents.
The constant fear renders this
film much darker than its predeces-
sors. Hogwarts loses its innocent feel
under clouds of the Dark Mark, and
director David Yates ("Harry Potter
and the Order of the Phoenix") steps
up to present stunningscenes of vio-
lence including the opening shot of a
collapsing bridge and, later, (spoiler
alert!) Albus Dumbledore's (Michael
Gambon, "The Good Shepherd")
death. Though the idea of a world of

witchcraft and wizardry is certainly
whimsical, Yates does a nice job of
presenting a world that, despite its
magic, can still be touched by trag-
edy.
Just as good forces battle with
evil, the dark times battle against
light-hearted ones. Harry, Ron
and Hermoine all find themselves
with romantic aspirations. But the
romance is forced and the film sug-
gests, without much subtlety,that the
characters are all grown-up. At one
point Dumbledore makes a peculiar
comment to Harry about his need
to shave. It's the physical, off-screen
development of the actors that sug-
gests maturation, but the characters
have hardly changed in personality
from the first movie.
While it's a shame that character
development is sacrificed for Quid-
ditch and snugging, there are some

Auerbach's sweaters can be seen in UMMA's Project Gallery through October.

have the perhaps naive hope that art can
change the world. I do think every decision
we make is a political decision in some way. A
lot of my work is about speaking out, speak-
ing up, getting the word out."
Her association with UMMA is a logical one
- Auerbach is a former Ann Arbor resident.
"I met (Jacob Proctor, UMMA's Associate
Curator of Modern & Contemporary Art) at
Art Basel Miami Beach, where I had a solo
exhibition in 2007. and he invited me to do

a show at UMMA," Auerbach explained.
"Both of my parents went to the University
of Michigan. My mother studied zoology and
my father studied law. I was born on campus,
but only lived in Ann Arbor for a few months
when I was an infant."
UMMA and Auerbach worked closely
together to construct an exhibit that was
both visually and intellectually intriguing.
"I worked with Jacob Proctor at UMMA
to choose the pieces for the show," Auerbach
wrote. "It was his idea to show the small busi-
ness photographs and the sweaters together
in the space."
Some new, never-before-displayed work is
currently on exhibit at UMMA.

"I made a few sweaters especially for this
show that Jacob didn't know about until they
arrived in Michigan," Auerbach explained.
"One of the new sweaters is about Michael
Jackson."
The exhibit at UMMA occurs in a section
of the museum where three walls completely
made of glass allow both students on their
way to class and museum patrons a glimpse.
Blown-up photographs dot the walls, but the
focus is on two dozen of Auerbach's sweaters,
which are displayed on clear plastic molds
suspended from the ceiling by wire.
This stark presentation allows the viewer
to concentrate on the complexity and subtle
wit of her work. The aforementioned Jack-
son sweater, for instance,
reads, "Take my hand,
BoR.BERS it's off to never never
Band," a reference both
UJRS to the singer's infamous
California abode and

struggle comes in the
presentation of material,
not in the physical pro-

cess of knitting.
"At this point, the designing phase takes
longer than the actual knitting," Auerbach
wrote. "Figuring out what a sweater should
say is often really difficult. I'm looking for
text that can be thought-provoking, funny
and unexpected.'A lot of the sweaters I'm
making are about much-discussed issues,
and I prefer to have an alternative take, so I
spend a lot of time researching."
Naturally, however, textile construction
brings its own unique challenges. "There was

machine knitting," Auerbach explained. "I
thought it would be easy, since it's a machine?
But figuring out how to use that technology
was challenging. The knitting itself is tedious
and takes a bit of time."
And of course, the prosaic realities of
everyday life invade.

Auerbach added.

Yes, we realize that he was one of
the unforeseen players that brought
about last season's success, but that
doesn't change how unappreci-
ated Novak is. Without his 14 points
againstthen-No.4Duke,theWolver-
ines never could have pulled off the
magical upset. This season, with Stu
Douglass switching at point guard
with incoming freshman Darius
Morris, Novak will sink more into
his role at shooting guard.

With the graduation of defensive
stalwart Terrence Taylor, the Michi-
gan football team is leftwith a gaping
hole in the middle of GregRobinson's
defense - and Martin is the right
man for the defensive tackle job.
Much quicker than Taylor, Martin
is more inclined to get to the quar-
terback, and teamed with incoming
freshman Will Campbell, he should
be playing nearly every down at one
of Michigan's thinnest positions.

Patrick Omameh Tyler Burgoon

No one denies that the offensive
line was a shell of its former self last
football season. And with Stephen
Schilling moving to left guard where
he belongs, the right tackle position
is wide open. Money says Omameh
gets the job. According to a July 11
article from Mark Snyder of the
Detroit Free Press, Omameh has put
on 30 pounds of pure muscle, which
can do nothing but help a line that
begged forJake Long last season.
Carlos Brown
In a football season that was
known early on for former-Wol-
verine Sam McGuffie and later for
then-junior Brandon Minor, Brown
was lost in the Wolverines' crowded
backfield. Brown has been injured a
lot in the past few years, but when
given the chance (i.e. Northwestern
last year), Brown can be lightning to
Minor's thunder.

Michigan baseball coach Rich
Maloney made it no secret that he
had high hopes for Burgoon last sea-
son. Unfortunately, Burgoon spent
some time injured and finished with
an ERA hovering around five. This
summer, Burgoon is tearing up the
Cape Cod League for the Yarmouth-
Dennis Red Sox, earning himself a
spot in the All-Star game.With Chris
Fetter off to the Padres, Burgoon's
time to shine could be this season.
Matt Vogrich
Enter this year's Zack Novak.
ESPN has him rated higher than
Darius Morris in the 2009 recruit-
ing class. Reports say he is devas-
tating from behind the arc. And at
6'4", he's no push over. Everything
wehear makesitsound likeVogrich
is a perfect fit in Beilein's offense
and adds to an already impressive
three-point shooting arsenal.

As a freshman last season, Bur-
ion was a contributor in one of the
NCAA hockey's deepest defensive
squads. Now, with Mark Mitera off
to Anaheim, Burlon will have the
chance to play alongside captain
Chris Summers on the first line.
And with two goalies that turned
out to be headcases in the past two
postseasons, the defense could
make or break this team's chances
at an NCAA Championship.
Tyler Clary
It's hard to believe that an NCAA
NationalChampionwouldbeunder
the radar, but when students and
alumni think of Michigan swim-
ming, they think eight-time Gold
Medal-winner Michael Phelps.
Well, Clary is hot on Mr. Phelps'
tail. After a second-place finish to
Phelps at the U.S. National Cham-
pionships, Clary comes back next
year as, arguably, one of the best
swimmers in the NCAA.
Darryl Stonum
With offers from Florida, USC,
Alabama and a slew of other big-
time college programs, Stonum
was supposed to be the next in
line of talented Michigan receiv-
ers. His career has been devastat-
ed by off-the-field issues and bad
quarterback play. But this year
should be his with an accurate
quarterback in Tate Forcier.
Mauro Fuzetti
If it wasn't for superstar Peri
Marosevic last season on the soc-
cer field, the Wolverine nation
would know Fuzetti. But overshad-
owed by the' fifth pick in the MLS
Draft, Fuzetti's 24 points was good
enough to make him All-Big Ten
first team, just not to get noticed.
Fuzetti is ready for the limelight.


Chris Cameron/ Alex Hunt
Thomas Kelley

Both competed with the Big
Ten's best for the all-around men's
gymnastics title lastyear, with Kel-
ley winning. Both were a key part
of Michigan's co-Big Ten Cham-
pionship. And both were the main
reason the Wolverines finished as
NCAA runner-ups. Did we men-
tion they're still juniors?

As a freshman last season, Hunt
was every volleyball coach's dream
- a tall, left-handed hitter. But she
far exceeded expectations with
243 kills. Her development will be
crucial if the Wolverines hope to
defeat (or even win a set against)
Big Ten superpower Penn State
next season.
