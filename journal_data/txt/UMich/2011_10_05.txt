University Research
Corridor launched
71 start-ups in last
five years
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily StaffReporter
While the state has stripped
millions of dollars in funding for
higher education, Michigan's
three largest research institu-
tions have given that amount, and
more, back to the state.
The University Research Cor-
ridor, a consortium of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Michigan
State University and Wayne State
University, released a report yes-
terday crediting the corridor with
a $15.2 billion contribution to the
state's economy.
The University of Michi-
gan alone spent $1.24 billion on
research in the 2010 fiscal year,
and the 2011 Empowering Michi-
gan Economic Impact Report
indicates thq URC spent $1.8 bil-
lion on research in the last year.
Since its inception in 2006, the

universities that arepart of the
URC have awarded an increas-
ing number of high-tech degrees
and havt grown 13.3 percent from
2006 to 2010. The corridor also
fostered 14 start-up companies in
2010 and has produced 71 start-up
companies in the past five years.
URC Executive Director Jeff
Mason said the findings show the
significance of the universities'
collaboration.
"The universities that came
together five years ago to create
the URC are having a significant
impact on Michigan's economy
and the future of our economy
here in the state," Mason said.
Similarly, University President
Mary Sue Coleman wrote in an
press release issued yesterday
that the report shows how much
universities can help the state.
"Higher education plays an
increasingly significant role in
the transformation of our state,
region and national economy,"
Coleman wrote. "This report is
clear evidence of that impact."

Customer data
transferred in
$13.9 million deal
By ANDREW SCHULMAN

Subscribers to newslet-
ters from the defunct Borders
___ Group Inc. may still receive

e-mails announcing new book
releases, discounts and promo-
tions. But, the sender won't be
the recently closed Ann Arbor-
based company.
As part of a $13.9 million deal
to acquire most of Borders's
intellectual property, Barnes
& Noble will gain Borders's
website, trademarks and infor-
mation database for 48 mil-
lion customers. The sale was

approved in a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court on Sept. 26. The- deal
came four days after discus-
sions between the court's judge
and a third-party ombudsman
about whether the transfer of
the database, which includes
former Borders customers' first
and last names, e-mail address-
es and phone numbers, could
compromise consumer privacy.
Barnes & Noble earned pur-

chasing rights for the intel-
lectual property in a Sept. 14
auction. On Sept. 22,in one of
the first hearings since the auc-

from approving the deal. More

CAMPUS CRIME
DPS releases annual safety report,
larcenies still most frequent crime

DPS chief: 2010
campus crime rates
similar to past
By BRANDON SHAW
Daily StaffReporter
Despite the recent rise in
reported assaults near campus,
crime data released last week

indicates there was no large
change in criminal activity on
campus last year.
The University's Depart-
ment of Public Safety released
the University of Michigan
Annual Security Report and
Annual Fire Safety Report on
Friday. Previously referred
to as the Campus Safety
Handbook, the report con-
tains crime statistics in DPS's

jurisdiction - all University
property - for 2010. The infor-
mation is required by law to be
publicly released, as outlined
in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure
of Campus Security Policy and
Campus Crime Statistics Act.
DPS Chief Greg O'Dell said
the crime data shows noth-
ing particularly different
from previous years. The most
reported crime during 2010

was larceny with 840 reports
- an increase from 786 larce-
nies in 2009. In 2008, there
were 861 larcenies.
In addition to the larcenies,
there were 50 sexual assaults
reported to the University's
Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center as well
as 10 aggravated assaults,
27 burglaries, 391 liquor law

Jennifer Egan discusses her latest novel during campus visit

Author of 'A Visit

By CASSIE BALFOUR
Daily Community Culture Editor
Yesterday's roundtable dis-
cussion in the Hopwood Room
found Jennifer Egan packing
the room as effectively as the
rockers she writes about in her
latest novel, "A Visit from the
Goon Squad."
Egan's work has resonated
with everyone, from the Mas-
ter of Fine Arts students and
smattering of Ann Arbor resi-

dents who crowded yesterday's
roundtable discussion, to even
the 2011 Pulitzer Prize Board
that bestowed "Goon Squad"
with one of most coveted prizes
in literature. The famed author
was invited as part of the Zell
Visiting Writers Series to make
three public appearances at the
University this week, culminat-
ing in a lecture this afternoon
at the University of Michigan
Museum of Art.
Despite having written
"Goon Squad" with a middle-
aged demographic in mind, the
book has a punk-rock sensibil-
ity that makes it appealing for
a wider audience than just par-

Educating with Jell-O brains

One club on campus
puts a unique spin on
brain education by offer-
ing an activity in which
participants consume
a brain made of Jell-O
before learning about how
the organ works.
BrainsRule! collabo-
rates with the Univer-
sity's Neuroscience
Graduate Program for an
annual event in which
middle school students
from the region are
invited to participate in
a variety of interactive
and educational exhibits
about the brain, accord-
ing to Rackham student

Stephanie Temme, the
former co-director of
BrainsRule!
"We want to reach them
at that crucial age and
show them that science
can be fun, interesting
and you don't necessarily
have to be a crazy genius
or something to be a sci-
entist," Temme said.
Since the group's cre-
ation in 2001, BrainsRule!
has hosted more than
220 fifth-and-sixth grade
students. For the event,
BrainsRule! members
design and run 20 booths
about neuroscience for
students to learn about

brain functions.
Though the event is
usually organized by
neuroscience graduate
students, BrainsRule!
encourages all interested
University students to
participate. Temme said
the club typically has
about 60 graduate and
undergraduate student
volunteers.
Planning for the 2012
BrainsRule! fair is under-
way and is tentatively
scheduled to take place
during Brain Awareness
week March 12 to 18.

Tutu attacks African National
Congress over Dalai Lama visa

South African
officials deny
claims of China's
involvement
JOHANNESBURG (AP) -
Retired Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, an anti-apartheid hero
often described as South Afri-
ca's conscience, slammed the
ANC-led government yesterday
as "disgraceful" and said it is
worse than the country's former
oppressive white regime for not

issuing a visa to the Dalai Lama.
The African National Con-
gress responded by calling
Tutu's comparisons to the apart-
heid regime and to toppled Arab
dictatorships "very unfortunate
and totally misplaced," and said
the government should be given
time to explain its actions.
South African foreign minis-
try officials have denied accusa-
tions they are stalling on the visa
because of pressure from China,
a major trading partner. Tutu,
who received the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1984 for his nonviolent
campaign against white racist

rule, turns 80 on Friday and had
invited his fellow Nobel laureate
to South Africa to celebrate his
birthday.
Tutu angrily denounced ANC
leaders in a nationally televised
news conference hours after the
Dalai Lama's office said he was
calling off the visit because he
didn't expect to get a visa. Tutu,
who struggled for years alongside
the ANC and other anti-apart-
heid groups to defeat oppressive
white rule, said South Africans
expect their government to stand
for the human rights as laid out in
the constitution.

Amanda Knox (right) is comforted by her parents Curt Knox and Edda Mellas during a press conference shortly after she
arrives in Seattle yesterday.
After four-year ordeal,
Knox returns to Seattle*

Friends and family
celebrate among
crowd of media
SEATTLE (AP) - Amanda
Knox returned to her hometown
of Seattle yesterday with four
years in an Italian prison behind
her, the stabbing death of her
roommate still a mystery and the
media frenzy surrounding her
case as strong on U.S. soil as it
was in Europe.
Friends and family who
held spaghetti dinners, bowl-
ing events and concerts to raise
money for Knox's defense were
thrilled to have her home, but her
supporters were a small presence
at the Seattle-Tacoma Interna-
tional Airport compared to the
media: dozens of U.S. and inter-
national reporters, along with
cameras and satellite trucks.
Knox's life turned around dra-
matically Monday when an Ital-
ian appeals court threw out her
conviction in the sexual assault
and fatal stabbing of her British
roommate. Yesterday a court-
room picture ofKnox crying after
the verdict was read appeared on
AI .

the front pages of newspapers in
Italy, the U.S., Britain and around
the world.
The court's decision, fueled
by doubts over DNA evidence,
stunned the victim's family and
angered the prosecution, which
insists that she was among three
people who killed 21-year-old
Meredith Kercher. But for Knox's
grandmother Elisabeth Huff, "it
was like the weight of the world
had gone."
"We all are as happy as can be.
I can't tell you how long we've
been looking forward to this
day," Huff told The Associated
Press outside her home in West
Seattle, a tight-knit community a
few miles across Elliott Bay from
downtown.
"WELCOME HOME AMAN-
DA," read the marquee at a
record store in the neighborhood
where Knox grew up. Another
welcome sign was hung at her
father's house. A bar offered
half-price drinks to celebrate her
acquittal. At least one TV station
in Washington state tracked the
progress of her flight on the air
using a plane-tracking website.
Knox, 24, left Perugia's
Capanne prison Monday night

amid cheers that a companion
compared to those at a soccer
stadium.
Hundredsofinmates - mostof
them in the men's wing - shout-
ed "Amanda, ciao!" and "Free-
dom!" as she walked into the
central courtyard, said Corrado
Maria Daclon, head of the Italy-
US Foundation, which champi-
oned Knox's cause. Daclon said
Knox jumped a little for joy and
waved to the prisoners.
She was soon on her way
home, protected by the darkened
windows of a Mercedes that led
her out of the prison in the mid-
dle of the night, and then yester-
day morning to Rome's Leonardo
da Vinci airport. She flew from
Rome to London, where she took
a direct British Airways flight
to Seattle, flying business class
with full-length seat and menu 0
options including champagne,
smoked salmon and prawn salad.
She and her family were on
the plane's secluded upper deck.
At least nine members of media
organizations were on board
below, but a flight attendant S
blocked them from climbing the
stairs "to preserve the privacy"
of passengers.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Delta passenger
held for disruptive
behavior on flight
Delta Air Lines says fedefal
officials detained a man who
became disruptive on an Amster-
dam-to-Detroit flight.
Airline spokeswoman Susan
Elliott says the man "was quickly
restrained" and taken into cus-
tody when the flight landed at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport
about 4 p.m. yesterday.
Elliott says Flight 235 contin-
ued to Detroit without further
incident. Her statement didn't
describe how the man was dis-
ruptive, how he was restrained
or who restrained him.
The incident occurred on the
same day jury selection began

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a
Nigerian man accused of trying
to bring down an Amsterdam-to-
Detroit flight with a bomb in his
underwear on Christmas 2009.

Dust storms cause

pileups, 15 injuries
A blinding dust storm has
. caused three different pileups
along a major interstate in Ari-
zona yesterday, killing one man
and injuring more than 15 other
people.
The Arizona Department of
Public Safety says 24 vehicles
" were involved in the three crash-
es along Interstate 10.
The first two crashes occurred
just after noon near Picacho,
about midway between Phoenix
and Tucson. Those collisions
involved 16 vehicles, including
tractor-trailers.

Suspect in three
murders to be

A former U.S. Marine who was
convicted of three murders in
Illinois will be returned to Cali-

Andrew Urdiales, 47, will
arrive Thursday to be pros-
ecuted in killings committed in
Orange, Riverside and San Diego
counties from 1986 to 1995, the
Orange County district attorney
said.
Urdiales was convicted in
2002 in Illinois for killing two
women and again in 2004 for
killing a third.
He is accused of killing four of
the Southern California women
while stationed at various
military facilities in the three-
county region and of killing the
fifth while on vacation in Palm

Springs in 1995.
UNITED NATIONS
Russia, China
vetoes sanctions
against Syria
Russia and China vetoed a
i European-backed U.N. Security
Council resolution yesterday that
threatened sanctions against
Syria if it didn't immediately halt
its military crackdown against
'civilians.
It would have been the first
legally binding resolution adopt-
ed by the Security Council since
President Bashar Assad's military
began using tanks and soldiers
against protesters in mid-March.
Its defeat reflects the deep divi-
sions in the U.N's most power-
ful body over how to address the
ongoing violence in Syria, which
the U.N. estimates has led to more
than 2,700 deaths.
The European sponsors of the
resolution tried to avoid a veto by
9 watering down the language on
sanctions three times, to the point
where the word "sanctions" was
taken out, but they failed.
The vote was 9-2 with four
abstentions - India, SouthAfrica,
Brazil and Lebanon.

Private chopper
crashes into East
River yesterday

President Barack Obama urges Congress to pass the American Jobs Act at Eastfield College in Mesquite, Texas,
yesterday.
Obam a criticizes GOP
for inaction on jobs bill1

President blames
Republicans for
tabling vote
Mesquite, Tex (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama is naming
names.
First he singled out House
Speaker John Boehner and Sen-
ate Republican leader Mitch
McConnell.
Yesterday, Rep. Eric Cantor,
R-Va., came in for a presiden-
tial scolding as Obama used an
economic sales pitch in Texas
to criticize the House majority
leader for refusing to take up
the president's jobs bill.
"Eric Cantor said that right
now, he won't even let this jobs
bill have a vote in the House of
Representatives. That's whathe
said. Won't even let it be debat-
ed," Obama said in a speech at
a community college in Mes-
quite, a Dallas suburb. "Think
about that. What's the prob-
lem? Do they not have the time?
They just had a week off. Is it
inconvenient?"
"At least put this jobs bill
up for a vote so that the entire
country knows exactly where

members of Congress stand,"
the president said. "Put your
cards on the table."
Even as Obama spoke, McCo-
nnell was attempting to call his
bluff by pushing for a quick
Senate vote on the jobs bill,
which Senate Democrats have
acknowledged doesn't have the
support to pass.
White House press secretary
Jay Carney called that a "politi-
cal ploy," and Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid objected,
arguing that the bill should
not be acted on without Senate
debate.
It underscored Obama's
dilemma as he travels the coun-
try seeking to isolate Repub-
licans to take the blame if his
jobs bill doesn't pass - without
a clear strategy for ensuring it
does.
The approach puts the,
Obama administration at risk
of appearing to use the presi-
dent's $447 billion jobs bill as
a political weapon rather than
as a means of fixing the nation's
economic woes and putting
Americans back to work.
And it relies heavily on the
assumption that the public
won't also hold Obama account-

able if he can't get Congress to
act.
Obama spoke a day after
Cantor said that while the plan
contained elements thatRepub-
licans could support, "this all
or nothing approach is unrea-
sonable."
Cantor's spokesman, Brad
Dayspring, disputed Obama's
criticism.
"If House Republicans sent
our plan for America's job cre-
ators to the president, would
he promise not to veto it in its
entirety? Would he travel dis-
trict to district and explain why
he'd block such common-sense
ideas to create jobs?" Dayspring
said. "House Republicans have
different ideas on how to grow
the economy and create jobs,
but that shouldn't prevent us
from trying to find areas of
common ground with the presi-
dent."
The president charges that
it's Republicans who won't
work with him.
"I realize that some Repub-
licans in Washington are resis-
tant, partly because I proposed
it. If I took the party platform
and proposed it, they'd sud-
denly be against it," he said.

Passenger killed,
three wounded in
helicopter crash
NEW YORK (AP) - A heli-
copter on a private tour with
five people aboard sputtered and
crashed into the East River yes-
terday afternoon shortly after
takeoff from a riverbank heli-
port, killing one passenger and
injuring three others.
The 40-year-old victim appar-
ently was trapped inside as
the chopper sank about 50 feet
below the surface of the swift-
moving water, police said. New
York Police Department divers
pulled her from the water about
90 minutes after the Bell 206 Jet
Ranger went down at around 3
p.m. She was pronounced dead at
the scene.
Emergency crews arrived
within seconds of the crash to
find the helicopter upside-down
in the murky water with just its
skids showing on the surface.
The pilot, Paul Dudley, and three
passengers were bobbing, and
witnesses reported a man diving
down, possibly in an attempt to
rescue the remaining passenger.
The passengers were friends of
the pilot's family: a husband and
wife who were British and living
in Portugal; the wife's daugh-
ter, also British, who died at the
scene; and the daughter's Aus-
tralian friend. The daughter and
friend were living in Australia.
The pilot's wife, Sunhe Dud-
ley, told The Associated Press
that she had spoken to her hus-
band briefly after the crash.
"I think that he's OK," she
said. "These were actually very
dear friends of ours that were in
the helicopter."
The passengers were pulled
from the water shortly after
emergency crews arrived on the
scene, police spokesman Paul
Browne said. Fire department
rescue paramedics revived both
women, who were in critical
condition; the man was stable.
All were hospitalized. The pilot
swam to shore and was unin-
jured.
The private chopper appar-
ently had run into trouble and
was trying to return to the heli-
port when it went into the river
off 34th Street in midtown Man-
hattan, a few blocks south of the
United Nations headquarters. It's
unclear what happened, but wit-
nesses reported it was sputtering
and appeared to be in some type
of mechanical distress.
Joy Garnett and her husband
were on the dock waiting to take
the East River ferry to Brooklyn
when they heard the blades of a
helicopter and saw it start to take
off from the nearby helipad. She
said she saw it do "a funny curli-
cue."
"I thought,'Is that some dare-
devil move?' she said. "But it
was obviously out of control. The
body spun around at least two
or three times, and then it went
down."
She said the chopper had lift-
ed about 25 feet off the ground
before it dropped into the water
without much of a splash. It
flipped over, and the blades were

sticking up out of the river.

Joseph Belez was watching
helicopters from a boardwalk
and saw the crash.
"It was going up, and then all
of a sudden it just spun itself and
went down to the water," he said.
"I was just watching it take off,
and it was just all of a sudden
spinning. It just went down. It
was a shock. It really was."
A massive rescue effort was
under way within minutes of
the crash, with a dozen boats
and divers down into the cold,
grey water. Police officers doing
a counterterrorism drill nearby
jumped into the water wearing
their uniforms, and without any
rescue equipmentcthey pulled the
three passengers to shore.
"The pilot did indicate that
there was somebody still in the
helicopter," Lt. Larry Serras said.
"By the time we swam to the
helicopter it was completely sub-
merged."
Officer Jason Gregory, one of
the divers who brought the wom-
an's body to the surface, said the
helicopter was upside down in
the sediment. He said the woman
was in the back seat and wasn't
buckled in by any seat belt.
The helicopter was from
Linden, N.J., near the Statue
of Liberty and the Newark,
N.J., international airport and
a popular base and refueling
stop for helicopters operating in
New York. The pilot apparently
reported problems in the heli-
copter and said he was turning
around, Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg said.
Paul Dudley is a commercial
pilot and owns Linden Airport
Services, the company that man-
ages the Linden municipal air-
port under a 20-year contract
with the city, Linden Mayor
Richard Gerbounka said.
"He flies light aircraft, he flies
helicopters," Gerbounka said.
"He's an accomplished pilot."
In November 2006, Dudley
landed a Cessna 172 light plane
in a park near Coney Island in
Brooklyn after the engine failed.
No one was hurt during the emer-
gency landing, and the plane
was taken back to Linden after
mechanics removed the wings.
The National Transporta-
tion Safety Board was on scene
yesterday, and crews pulled the
wreckage from the water about
four hours after it went down.
The chopper would be taken to
the police department's Floyd
Bennett Field in Brooklyn. The
airport in Linden was locked
down briefly pending the arrival
of Federal Aviation Administra-
tion and NTSB investigators.
The Bell 206 Jet Ranger is
one of the world's most popular
helicopter models and was first
flown in January 1966. They are
light and highly maneuverable,
making them popular with tele-
vision stations and air taxi com-
panies. A new one costs between
$700,000 and $1.2 million.
The East River has been par-
ticularly tricky for pilots because
of its many bridges and its prox-
imity to LaGuardia, one of the
nation's busiest airports. In 2006,
New York Yankees pitcher Cory
Lidle died when the Cirrus light
plane he was flying crashed into a
residential building while trying
to make a turn over the river.

Banks, mortgage companies
on trial for defrauding veterans

Atlanta court
unseals lawsuit
against bank
lenders
ATLANTA (AP) - A whistle-
blower lawsuit launched in 2006
and unsealed yesterday in fed-
eral court in Atlanta claims sev-
eral large banks and mortgage
companies defrauded military
veterans and taxpayers out of
hundreds of millions of dollars
in a"brazen scheme" to hide ille-
gal fees.
The lawsuit, brought under
the Federal Claims Act by two
mortgage brokers, claims the 13
banks and mortgage firms over-
charged veterans who were
applying for special home loans
guaranteed by the Department
of Veterans Affairs.
Federal rules allow the lend-
ers to charge "reasonable and
customary" fees and taxes, the
lawsuitsaid,but they are barred
from charging them attorneys'
fees and settlement closing
costs for the loans. The firms
skirted the rules by charging
attorneys' fees by hiding them
as "title examination" or "title
search" fees, it said.
Veterans were ultimately
saddled with "excessive and
illegal fees at closing," the com-
plaint said.
The lawsuit targets several
firms, including Wells Fargo,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Bank of America. Several of
the firms did not immediately
return messages late Tues-
day seeking comment on the
lawsuit. A Bank of America

spokesman and a Wells Fargo
Home Mortgage spokeswoman
declined to comment. The banks
have denied the allegations in
related court documents.
The lawsuit was initially filed
in 2006, but attorneys say it's
common for these types of com-
plaintsto remain sealed for years
while they are being investigat-
ed. It seeks to recover damages
and penalties on behalf of the
federal government, which said
in court records that it wouldn't
intervene.
The fees weren't necessarily
linked tothe global
More than 1.2 million of the
refinanced loans have been
made to veterans and their fami-
lies over the past decade, and up

to 90 percent of them were taint-
ed with the alleged fraud, plain-
tiff's attorneys said. The firms
collected $300 to $1,000 with
each deal, which could amount
to "massive damages" to the fed-
eral government, the complaint
said.
"This is a massive fraud onthe
American taxpayers and Ameri-
canveterans," said James E. But-
ler, Jr., one of the attorneys who
brought the case.
"Knowing they weren't
allowed to charge the fees, the
banks and mortgage companies
inflated allowable charges to
hide these illegal fees without
telling the veterans who were
the borrowers or the VA they
were doing so."

Arrest this development
Plan to privatize prisons should be locked up
The city of Detroit is about to lose even more jobs as the
Michigan Department of Corrections plans to close the
Mound Correctional Facility and privatize medical servic-
es for prisoners. Approximately 2,000 employees will be laid off as
a result of the plan. While many legislators voice support for the
reform, stating that the changes have been "long overdue," those
opposed express concern over the negative impact on employees,
communities and families of those imprisoned. The relocation of
prisoners from the facility is another looming concern. The care of
prisoners should be state regulated, not privatized, to avoid poten-
tial negative consequences. Closing the Mound Correctional Facil-
ity is a viable way to cut costs from the state's corrections budget,
but closing prisons is not an effective way to solve all the problems
in the corrections system.

The fact that African Ameri-
cans vote overwhelmingly
for the Democratic Party is
probably obvi-
ous, but here
are some recent
presidential
election statis-
tics anyway: 96
percent of black
voters voted for
Barack Obama DAR-WEI
in 2008, 88 per- CHEN
cent voted for
John Kerry in
2004 and 90 percent voted for Al
Gore in 2000. Many theories have
been thrown around to explain this
phenomenon, and this year, Herman
Cain is joining in saying, "African
Americans have been brainwashed
... not even considering a conserva-
tive point of view" in an interview
with CNN last week. Does Cain's
"brainwashed" theory make sense?
The extent to which blacks support
Democrats is pretty staggering, after
all, Kerry received roughly the same
level of support from voters in his
own party at 89 percent!
Cain's theory implies that African
Americans aren't paying attention
to policy - voting blindly for Demo-
crats instead of voting for the party
that represents their interests. Noth-
ing could be further from the truth.
Consider this: According to Ford
School of Public Policy's National
Poverty Center, 27.4 percent of
blacks lived in poverty in 2010,
including a sickening 38.2 percent
of black children (both of these rates
are substantially higher than the
national average). Which political
ideology has stood up for the poor in
recent years? On one hand, Repub-
lican presidential candidates Mitt
Romney, Rick Perry and Michele
Bachmann have all said that the tax
base needs to be broadened because
many lower-income Americans
don't pay any income taxes (wait, I
thought they despise raisingtaxes...)

- as if those struggling Americans
are really in a position to help with
the economy. According to the GOP,
the people living in poverty are in
a better position to contribute to
taxes than the wealthiest among us.
On the other hand, the Democrats
have consistently held that the rich-
est Americans shouldn't get massive
tax breaks that ordinary Americans
don'tget. Theyhave also maintained
that at a time when many in the poor
and middle class are barely staying
afloat, government programs target-
ed at helping those people shouldn't
be cut unless the richest Americans
first pay their fair share of taxes.
If African Americans are aided by
liberal policy, and the Democratic
Party is the liberal party right now,
African American votes for Demo-
cratic candidates aren't surprising
at all.
Economics isn't even the whole
story. Throughout history, liber-
als have been consistently more
sympathetic toward social injus-
tices than conservatives. Affirma-
tive action, for example, is a liberal
idea. Democrats generally believe
that affirmative action is necessary
to compensate for discrimination
against affected minorities and pop-
ulation subgroups. The GOP seems
to believe that racism in America is
gone now and that everyone has a
level playing field. No more racism
in the age of Obama, right? I'll tell
you what - when African Ameri-
cans start to receive mortgage loans
at the same interest rates that whites
do (according to a study by the Hous-
ing Center in Cleveland, 58.7 percent
of upper-income blacks received
high-cost loans while 13.4 percent of
upper-income whites did), and when
African Americans are treated as
equals to whites on the road (blacks
caughtspeeding are ticketed at a 75.7
percent rate, compared with 66.6
percent of whites), then we can talk.
Perhaps African Americans are
also more likely to vote Democratic

because liberals tend to support
other subjugated minority groups,
and African Americans sympathize
with those people. Cain laments
about how blacks don'tembrace con-
servative views, but history shows
thatminorities have no other choice.
All the major social progress that
leads to a more inclusive America
has been spearheaded by liberals.
The civil rights movement, wom-
en's suffrage, repeal of "don't ask,
don't tell," acceptance of Muslims;
humane treatment of Hispanics and
the list goes on. Cain himself has
said in response to a question about
possibly appointing a Muslim to his
cabinet: "No, I will not ... there is
this attemptto gradually ease Sharia
law and the Muslim faith into our .
government. It does not belong in
our government." Can any African
American, knowing the pain of dis-
crimination, vote for someone like
Cain in good conscience?
Democrats
tend to protect
minority groups.
The GOP loves to talk about
Americans pulling themselves up by
their own bootstraps, but as Obama
has said before, you need boots first.
While the GOP is busy with its own
version of class warfare against the
country's neediest, Democrats are
promoting liberal policy to make
sure everyone gets a fair shot in life.
That, Mr. Cain, is the reason Afri-
can Americans are liberal. If you
think the GOP fights for minorities
as much as the Democrats do - fine,
that's your opinion. Just don't expect
African Americans to agree withyou.

The Mound Correctional Facility, which
currently holds 1,000 prisoners and costs
$32.6 million per year to operate, is set to close
in January 2012. The corrections department
will save up to $63 billion by 2013 by cutting
from its budget, which is largely funded by the
state rather than federal subsidies. Bids from
private corporations to run the Woodland
Center Correctional Facility: in Whitmore
Lake, which will hold mentally ill inmates, are
currently being discussed. In addition to clos-
ing the Mound facility, Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder hopes to implementa number of priva-
tization measures in the coming year, which
include the privatization of prison stores and
food services. Closing the facility will also
diminish revenue and jobs for the city and
nearby businesses.
Closing an entire facility isn't an effective
way for Michigan to reduce its corrections
budget. Instead, changing the operational
structure of the system and putting in place
the necessary procedures for closing prisons
would be more appropriate than privatizing

the system. Dangerous criminals should be
locked up in a more stable facility upon the clo-
sure of the Mound Correctional Facility while
criminals with less severe offenses should be
sent to rehabilitation centers to seek the help
they need. This will allow Michigan to dras-
tically reduce its corrections budget and treat
prisoners humanely.
Though Snyder has many privatization
initiatives in mind, these measures have the
potential to cause the mistreatment of prison-
ers. If companies take over, the treatment of
prisoners may be in jeopardy. These corpora-
tions operate for profit and there wouldn't
be any oversight to ensure the prisoners are
receiving proper care and food. It's important
that the care of prisoners be state regulated to
minimize the negative impacts that will result
from shutting down the facility.
The state needs to work on reducing the
correctional budget by changing the overall
system. State regulation should triumph over
privatization to ensure humane and just treat-
ment of those imprisoned.

Amid the sustainability dis-
cussions happening around
the University, there are
events in motion
that have drum
circles every-
where up in , ,
arms. Trans-
Canada is cur-
rently in the
process of
having plans JOE
approved to SUGIYAMA
extend its Key-
stone pipeline
through parts of Montana, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Okla-
homa and Texas. This move by the
Canadian company is under fire
by environmental groups across
the country and has been the
focal point of protests - resulting
in nearly 1,000 arrests - in our
nation's capital.
This issue dates back to 2008
whenthe first proposal forthe exten-
sion was given - the preliminary
approvals by the National Energy
Board followed in March 2010. Yet
with a final endorsement by Presi-
dent Barack Obama expected to be
handed down before the year's end,
environmental groups - like the
National Wildlife Federation - are
turning up the heat on the protests
and perhaps with good reason.
On Aug. 26 the United States State
Department issued its Final Envi-
ronmental Impact Statement (FEIS)
concerning precisely what the title
implies - the effect the Keystone
XL will have on the environment.
The report highlights topics such
as oil spill potential and response,
greenhouse gas emissions and the
effect the expansion will have on
the Northern High Plains Aquifer
system. Despite the extensiveness
of the report, it did little to sway
NWF's senior vice president Jim
Lyon, who claims the FEIS "still
fails to address the key concerns for
landowners and wildlife."
This may be somewhat true, but
I'm going to go out on a limb and
trust the State Department isn't

secretly trying to destroy the Great
Plains. The State Department has
covered most of its bases concerning
the potential effect of the Keystone
XL expansion. One of NWF's main
concerns - thoroughly addressed
in the FEIS - is the Northern High
Plains Aquifer system. This aquifer
system accounts for nearly 30 per-
cent of irrigation and agricultural
water supply in the U.S. and lies
directly beneath the proposed path
of the pipeline.
A failure in the Keystone XL
extension would undoubtedly have
a significant impact on the acute
region where the spill occurs, but
the State Department is certain that
an oil spill would not have a devas-
tating effect on the entire aquifer.
This conclusion is based on studies
of previous spills occurring in loca-
tions with similar relationships to
aquifer systems. In these cases, only
limited regions of the aquifers were
affected. The State Department
goes on to say "in no spill incident
scenario would the entire North-
ern High Plains Aquifer system be
adversely affected."
The various environmental con-
cerns of the NWF are warranted,
but based on the extent of the FEIS,
it seems like the State Department
has done its homework. Naturally,
reservations will always linger in the
minds of those hell-bent on saving
the environment, but in this case the
reward appears to outweigh the risk.
Part of the reward is an ener-
gized economy. The $7 billion proj-
ect would create nearly 20,000
job opportunities during the con-
struction and operation phases of
Keystone XL. This alone might be
enough to get the seal of approval
from Obama. The U.S. already has
200,000 miles of existing pipelines
that supply thousands of jobs and
deliver a product that we can't seem
to live without - what's another
2,000 miles of pipes?
The U.S. should be devoting a
large sum of money toward the
research and development of a sus-
tainable energy source, but that

doesn't change the fact that our
country runs on petroleum. Though
it would be nice to one day live in
a zero-emissions world, the fact
remains that such a world doesn't
exist and probably won't for quite
some time.With that in mind, it ends
up being economically and - believe
it or not - ecologically friendly to
spend money on improvingthe oil
distribution system, which in the
long run will cut down costs and
emissions associated with the trans-
portation of oil.
Your Prius can't
run on sun and
rainbows forever.
Another pessimism associated
with Keystone XL is the idea that
the extended pipeline is going to
increase America's dependence on
oil. That's like saying if a drug dealer
moves next door to a crackhead,
the latter is going to become more
of an addict. Not true. It just allows
the crackhead to get his fix with-
out going to the shady part of town.
For a country that already imports
10 of its 15 million barrels of oil per
day, we should certainly be looking
for ways to better interact with our
polite neighbors to the north, and
distance ourselves from an increas-
ingly tumultuous Middle East.
There is no clear answer to the
Keystone XL pipeline dilemma, and
though the project isn't set in stone,
it seems inevitable. You can talk all
you want about the negative impact
this pipeline is going to have, but in
the end, even your Prius can't run
on sunshine and rainbows forever.
TransCanada has its shovel ready to
break ground on the project, and it
might be time for the opposition to
stop kidding itself.

the state. He added that the URC
encourages the three universities
to collaborate instead of compet-
ing against one another.
The URC institutions are
also responsible for a significant
amount of job opportunities in
Michigan. The universities in
the URC had 50,531 full-time
employees in the 2010 fiscal year

and spent a collective $7.7 billion
on operations, according to the
report.
Mason said the report shows
why funding for universities is so
important, especially because the
state has seen a number of budget
cuts to higher education in recent
years. State universities saw a
15-percent reduction in state
funds forthe 2012 fiscalyear.
"Reports like this point out the
economic value and the tremen-
dous assets these three institu-

tions and higher institutions are
here in the state of Michigan,"
said Mason, addingthat he hopes
the data will influence the state to
invest more in higher education
in the future.
Mason added that he is
impressed with the numbers
released in this year's report.
"I think we were pleasantly
surprised to see this continued
growth, certainly given the econ-
omy and some of the challenges
our state faces," he said.

arrest/citations and 116 drug law
arrests, which occurred on cam-
pus and were reported to DPS in
2010. The numbers do not devi-
ate significantly from the 2009
numbers. However, there were
62 fewer drug law arrests in
2009 and 60 fewer in 2008.
O'Dell, who joined DPS at the
end of August, said he supports
camaraderie among members
of the campus community in an
effort to decrease crime rates.
"My goal is to engage every-
one ... students, staff, faculty and
any other members pf the cam-
pus community as well as other
police agencies," O'Dell said. "No
police agency can do it all alone,
so engaging with others as well
as the whole community is vital
to the success of a successful
police agency, and that is what I
strive for."
In a letter accompanying the

security report, O'Dell outlined
his goals and strategic vision for
DPS.
"We must ensure that our
persons and property are secure
and protected by a responsible,
vigilant and caring population
of involved people who report
suspicious and unlawful behav-
ior immediately to the Depart-
ment of Public Safety," O'Dell
wrote.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said the report is not
particularly surprising, citing
the prevalence of larcenies on
campus - specifically larce-
nies involving automotive parts.
Brown added there was a larger
trend across Washtenaw County
of stealing items left in cars such
as GPS devices and other valu-
ables.
Certain aspects of the report
are mandated to be published
by law, but DPS includes infor-
mation such as critical safety
precautions for emergency situ-
ations and campus phone num-

bers in hopes of educating the
community, Brown said. DPS
printed 20,000 copies of the
report for the campus communi-
ty and published it electronically
to allow students to easily access
the information, Brown said.
Brown also pointed to presen-
tations and meetings DPS hosts
throughout the year regarding a
variety of topics including per-
sonal safety and how to deal with
an active shooter. Brown lauded
O'Dell for continuing to enforce
University standards, protocol
and policies.
"Our emphasis continues to be
what it was prior to his arrival,
that being that the highest prior-
ity being crimes against persons,
and also trying to provide safety
and security services to all of our
campus community, and con-
tinuing to educate our campus
community about ways to reduce
risk, and also being a very visible
and involved department within
our campus community," Brown
said.

BORDERS
From Page 1A
consumer privacy ombudsman,
Michael St. Patrick Baxter, and
voiced uncertainty about the
transfer of personal information
from Borders.
Compounding the sale's legal
hurdles, Baxter recommended
in his case report that the deal
not be approved without Barnes
& Noble receiving former Bor-
ders customers' consent to
transfer their personal informa-
tion. Since Borders customers
who registered their informa-
tion before May 27, 2008 had
agreed to a privacy policy with-
out a clause allowing for the sale
of their information, those cus-
tomers should have been able to
opt out of the transfer, Baxter
argued.
Attorneys representing for
Barnes & Noble and Borders in
a Sept. 21 hearing argued that
the consent requirements were
unnecessary because the stores'
privacy policies are similar, and
there was some overlap between
the two companies' customers,
according to Borders attorney
Andrew Glenn. As a compro-
mise, Barnes & Noble offered all
former' Borders customers the

chance to opt out of the transfer.
The judge then approved the
deal on Sept. 26.
If a former Borders customer
chooses not to opt out of the
transfer, his or her personal
information will be covered
under the Barnes & Noble pri-
vacy policy. Under this policy,
Barnes & Noble promises not to
sell or rent personal informa-
tion to third parties.
The terms of the transfer
amounted to a favorable set of
circumstances for former Bor-
ders customers, Glenn said in an
interview with The Michigan
Daily.
"There was no need for any
further measures," he said. "I
think that goes farther than any
case has ever required in terms
of consumer protections."
Carolyn Brown, Barnes &
Noble's director for corporate
communications, declined to
comment to the Daily on the
sale.
In an e-mail to former Bor-
ders customers sent on Sat-
urday, William Lynch, CEO
of Barnes & Noble, wrote that
those customers could opt out
through Barnes & Noble's web-
site until Oct. 15. If a customer
chooses to do so, he wrote,
"We will ensure all your data

we receive from Borders is dis-
posed of in a secure and confi-
dential manner."
However, Lynch urged for-
mer Borders customers to visit
Barnes & Noble stores, which he
wrote are nearby many former
Borders stores. Borders, which
was established in Ann Arbor
in 1971, its East Liberty Street
store closed on Sept. 12 - one of
399 stores nationwide that were
slated to be liquidated.
In his e-mail to Borders cus-
tomers, Lynch was transparent
about the company's motives
and encouraged the customers
to consider buying NOOK digi-
tal reading devices.
"Our intent in buying the
Borders customer list is simply
to try and earn your business,"
Lynch wrote. "We are readers
like you, and hope that through
our stores, NOOK devices, and
our bn.com online bookstore we
can win your trust and provide
you with a place to read and
shop."
Since the deal closed on Fri-
day, Borders should not have
any more legal hurdles, Glenn
said. However, the company's
future remains uncertain, as
Barnes & Noble holds onto Bor-
ders's website and brand trade-
marks.

MSA passes resolution

Resolution backs
Sixth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeal's
July decision
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily Staff Reporter
Representatives of the Michi-
gan Student Assembly's legisla-
tive branch passed a resolution
yesterday in support of the Sixth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal's
decision to uphold affirmative
action.
While six representatives of
the Student Assembly voted no
and five abstained, 11 members
of the assembly voted in favor of
the resolution. The assembly's
representatives debated the reso-
lution, with a number of people
opposed to affirmative action due
to its basis on race rather than
socioeconomic status. Only 22
representatives out of 40 active
representatives in the Student
Assembly voted at yesterday's
meeting.
The resolution that passed
does not take a definitive stance
on what the University's policy
toward affirmative action should
be. Instead, it states that MSA
supports the Sixth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeal's decision in July
that ruled a ban on affirmative
action is unconstitutional. How-
ever, last month, the court said it
would rehear the case.
The text of the Senate Assem-
bly resolution states that there

has been a 36-percent drop in
minority enrollment in the Col-
lege of Literature, Science and
the Arts since the 2006 state-
wide ban on affirmative action.
Additionally, there has been a
26-percent decrease in minor-
ity enrollment in the College of
Engineering, a56-percent drop in
the Law School and a 48-percent
decrease in the Medicine School,
accordingto the resolution.
MSA President DeAndree
Watson said he supports the res-
olution and is pleased it passed.
"I think that it's good that we
supported it, but I also think it's
important that we acknowledge
the concerns that were raised,
which is that students want to see
this as a holistic view," Watson
said. "I think it's good that stu-
dents, particularly student lead-
ers at the University of Michigan,
are looking at this issue."
A number of representatives,
including Engineering Rep.
Crissie Zuchora, objected to the
resolution on the basis that affir-
mative action doesn't address
socioeconomic status.
"Just taking in race and eth-
nicity is not enough for affirma-
tive action. It should also take in
social-economic considerations,
and that's why I opposed,"
Zuchora said in an interview
after the meeting.
The resolution's author, Art &
Design Rep. Ryan Herberholz,
told the assembly that the oppor-
tunity to attend a public univer-
sity should be equal for everyone,
regardless of what resources
may have been available to them

in high school. Herberholz said
despite the fact that he would
have been a prime candidate
for socioeconomic affirmative
action, he believes race-based
affirmative action evens out the
playing field.
"This is an equalizing factor
... it's not hurting anybody," he
said.
Zuchora said she would like
to pass another resolution in
the future that considers socio-
economic status. Watson agreed
that socio-economic status
should be a factor in affirmative
action.
"We've moved beyond the era
where it's blatant racism, and
it's more of an issue about your
socio-economic status and your
background," Watson said.
Rackham student Kate Sten-
vig, a member of the Coalition
to Defend Affirmative Action by
Any Means Necessary, was one
of the authors of the resolution.
Though she is not a member of
the Student Assembly, she was in
attendance last night and spoke
during the community concerns
portion of the meeting.
In an interview after the
meeting, Stenvig said it is crucial
that University students take a
stand in support of affirmative
action.
"Students at U of M have a
really important opportunity to
play a leading role nationally in
the fight to defend affirmative
action," Stenvig said.

ing the sculpture - commissioned
by German artist Herbert Drei-
seitl - due to disagreements about
public art fundingin the city.
The structure, which cost
$750,000, features a tall bronze
sculpture with a fountain at the
crest that dispenses water into a
retention pond. Blue lights, which
Dreiseitl compared to stars, illu-
minate the structure. A walkway
that leads to city hall will com-
plete the piece at the end of the
month.
In a speech at the event, Drei-
seitl - who has given lectures at
the University in the past - said
he began working on the piece in
2009, designing and assembling it
with doctoral students at the Har-
vard School of Graduate Design
where he was a fellow.
Chamberlin said people will be
able to appreciate the work of art
upon entering the building.
"With this art, we've created a
sense of place," Chamberlin said.
"A place that will be a gathering

spot."
Chamberlin also praised the
work of several volunteers who
contributed to the piece.
"It really has been a pleasure for
all ofus as volunteers to work with
the city staff, the architects and
all of the volunteers on the task
force," she said.
Following Chamberlin's
speech, Ann Arbor Mayor John
Hieftje noted that the piece had
been the subject of controversy
among community members.
"There is no public art pro-
gram that has been created with-
out dissent or without public
argument, and indeed that's part
of what happens with public art,"
Hieftje said. "It gets people talk-
ing. It's one of the reasons we
need it."
But according to Hieftje, the
money that funded the sculpture
couldn't have been used any other
way. He added the money allo-
cated for the public art program
would not have been allowed to be
spent in other departments.
In an interview after the event,
Chamberlin also addressed the

controversy about public art fund-
ing.
"It's going to be hard to be a
nay-sayer after tonight," Cham-
berlin said. "It's hard for people
in difficult times to imagine what
this can do. But I think that the
spirit that was here tonight and
the kind of spirit that public art
engenders ... just makes it part of
the communityimmediately."
In an interview after the event,
Dreiseitl said it was his first piece
made of bronze and the first piece
he had made mostly with robotic
sculpting.
"I (tried) to work very hard to
make something beautiful, some-
thing that relates people to the
beauty of water," he said.
Dreiseitl noted that working
with the local architecture, design
and fabrication companies that
assisted him with the structure
was a different experience from
working with his personal team
he typically works with.
"I had to jump into cold water
(here)," said Dreiseitl, adding that
the collaboration went well for
all parties involved.

despite the average student's
natural aversion to PowerPoint
presentations, the effect is strik-

erary tricks that make the novel
hard to categorize.
"So it's a constellation of sto-

Egan said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily, explaining
the difficulty of capturing "Goon

trying to describe the novel. "It's

She said she isn't the music con-

after reading the lyrical "Goon

and to the novel itself, which
grapples with the passage of

changing music business.

Michael Morton
spent 25 years
in prison for the
murder of his wife
GEORGETOWN, Texas
(AP) - A Texas grocery store
employee who spent nearly
25 years in prison in his wife's
beating death walked free yes-
terday after DNA tests showed
another man was responsible.
His attorneys say prosecutors
and investigators kept evidence
from the defense that would
have helped acquit him at trial.
Michael Morton, 57, was
convicted on circumstantial
evidence and sentenced to life
in prison for the August 1986
killing of his wife, Christine.
Morton said he left her and the
couple's 3-year-old son to head
to work early the morning of
the slaying, and maintained
through the years that an
intruder must have killed her.
Prosecutors had claimed
Morton killed his wife in a fit
of rage after she wouldn't have
sex with him followinga dinner
celebrating his 32nd birthday.
Wearing a simple button-
down shirt and a nervous smile,
Morton hugged each of his
half-dozen defense attorneys,
then hugged his parents after
District Judge Sid Harle said he
was a free man.
"You do have my sympa-
thies," Harle said. "You have
my apologies. . . . We do not
have a perfect system of justice,
but we have the best system of
justice in the world."

Addressing reporters
moments later, Morton strug-
gled to hold back tears.
"I thank God this wasn't a
capital case. That I only had
life because it gavethese saints
here at the Innocence Projects
time to do this," he said.
Texas has executed more
prisoners than any other state.
The New York-based Inno-
cence Project, which helped
Morton secure his release, spe-
cializes in using DNA testing to
overturn wrongful convictions.
This summer, using tech-
niques that weren't available
during Morton's 1987 trial,
authorities detected Christine
Morton's DNA on a bloody ban-
dana discovered near the Mor-
ton home soon after her death,
along with that of a convicted
felon whose name has not been
released.
"Colors seem real bright to
me now. Women are real good
looking," Morton said with a
smile. He then headed to a cel-
ebratory dinner with his family
and lawyers.
The case in Williamson
County, north of Austin, will
likely raise more questions
about the district attorney,
John Bradley, a Gov. Rick Perry
appointee whose tenure on the
Texas Forensic Science Com-
mission was controversial.
Bradley criticized the commis-
sion's investigation of the case
of Cameron Todd Willingham,
who was executed in2004 after
being convicted of arson in the
deaths of his three children.
Some experts have since con-
cluded the forensic science in
the case was faulty.

telling of a story that involves a
dramatic relationship between
a mother, her dead son and his
cousin. Williams's play explores
the tangled emotions of grief,
desire and madness. Like a car
accident people can't look away
from, audiences are drawn to
the depth of emotion, life-alter-
ing events and brutal violent
attitudes that only a family can
elicit.
"Suddenly Last Summer"
is about the strange death of
a young man and the shock-
ing after-effects surrounding
his grieving mother. The play
becomes a struggle between two
family members that leads to a
suspenseful and horrifying con-
clusion.
This year would have been

1983. "Suddenly Last Summer"

entire "X Factor" production is
very interesting - all the manip-
ulation and fake cues. Interns
scrawling fake signs for fake fans
inthe crowd. Custodians slipping
some carisoprodol into Paula
Abdul's 40-ounce Diet Pepsi dur-
ing breaks. The people turned
away for having too good a voice
(it happens).
And perhaps the original
promise of "Idol" was a novel
one: that in this lightning-quick
technology age we can craft a
wholly transparent interactive,
television production ... that
the American monoculture can
still clutch upon some notion of
understanding.
For now, the promise remains
defiantly hollow.
Orff's "Fortuna" is an adap-
tation of a 13th-century poetic
satire on fate and luck. "Sors
immanis / et inanis" goes it's
second stanza - "Fate, mon-
strous and empty." Maybe Orff
would be fine with it. For "The X
Factor," the tune feels curiously
appropriate.

Michigan fifth-year senior
David Molk was set on calling it
a career.
Heading into his junior year
at Lemont Township (Ill.) High
School, the center had received
little attention on the recruiting
trail - and he was OK with that.
"Going through high school, it
really wasn't, 'Oh, I'll just go play
college football now,' " Molk said
after practice Tuesday.
"(I was thinking) I have a year
left, or two years left, and then
football's done."
But then his dad received a
phone call. It was Northwestern
University.
When he received the call,
Molk was in his usual hang-out
spot - the weight room.
"My dad sprints up to the
weight room and goes, 'Dave!
Northwestern offered you,' "
Molk said, a smile creeping onto
his face.

Michigan offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges has recently opened
the playbook more, especially
during last weekend's 58-0 win

over Minnesota. The Michigan
offense featured a new diamond
set with both junior quarterback
Denard Robinson and backup

sophomore Devin Gardner on the
field - something Borges would
like to do more often.
But his creativity would have
to be limited without an experi-
enced center like Molk.
"It really does help (to have

Molk certainly fits that role. He's
a great athlete, a smart kid who
loves to play football. We're lucky

And now, Molk feels lucky to
be at Michigan as well. It was
a difficult decision during high
school - he said he narrowed his
decision down to Northwestern,
Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin
- but looking back on it, it seems
like a no-brainer.
"I wanted to be part of the

"I wanted to go where the

ONE WEEK IN THE HIMAL
HOW ONE STUDENT'S PH
WAS CHANGED IN DHAR
BYANKIT MEHTA

Rather than zigzagging up the
coniferous foothills of the Hima-
layas, we took an ill-advised direct
ascent up the Dhauladhar range
to reach our destination. Though
fatigued, I felt the allure of the
Dharamsala municipality, which
is home to His Holiness the Dalai
Lama and the dislocated Tibetan
government.
As we entered the village of
McLeod Ganj, my companions and
I were greeted by a street vendor
selling Momos, a steamed Tibet-
an dumpling. She was standing
in front of a large sign that read,
"Tibet: One People, One Nation.
Fifty Years of Resistance 1959-
2009." Her two missing front teeth
peeked through her smile as we
asked her for directions to the vil-
lage square. We politely bought
several Momos to show our appre-
ciation and set off to plan the next
several days of trekking, self-devel-
opment and acculturation to the

Tibetan lifestyle.
After World War II, the Chinese
government pronounced the unifi-
cation of all Chinese descendants
under one empire. It used this to
collude and forcefully take owner-
ship of Tibetan lands and perform a
cultural genocide. As Chinese hos-
tility peaked in 1959, the Tibetan
government and the Dalai Lama
fled Tibet for Dharamsala, India.
As we acclimated to the eleva-
tion, we spent time learning about
Buddhism. Our first stop was Tsug-
lagkhang, the Dalai Lama's temple.
The monks showed us ancient
Buddhist scripts that were carried
from Tibet during China's invasion
as we picked their brains about liv-
ing in the Himalayas. We also med-
itated for a mere twenty minutes
inside the temple - a task that was
extremely challenging considering
how modern society breeds us to
develop some level of A.D.D.

found a young lady sitting on her
porch.
She was a 24-year-old American
Buddhist who decided to spend two
years of her life in Dharamsala. She
offered us tea. She explained how
she felt liberated and content living
such a simple and sustainable life-
style, much different than what she
experienced stateside.
If one can eliminate desire, she
explained, one can eliminate suf-
fering and eventually attain nir-
vana, a perfect peace of mind. We
listened intently, thanked her for
the tea, and parted ways still in
deep thought.
. Since my trip, I have been chal-
lenging my familiar western
ideology, preaching lofty ideals
and requirements for a content
life. Having spent seven days in
Dharamsala, where locals believe
you can live an equally satisfying
life by focusing on simplicity and
developing good karma, I now see
an alternative path towards my
notion of "self-development."

reflected on this philosophy, the
more inspired I have become to

At this elevation, the main villages

On our way
down, we befriended two Gaddi

They guided us, and in return, we
fed them. It was an unspoken deal.
Ultimately, they ended up lead-

forced to improvise. Eventually, we

cancer. People tend to believe that
lung cancer is merely caused by
the inhalation of smoke into the
body, but these studies indicate that
genetic capabilities for the cancer
could somehow be regulated by the
very act of obtaining pleasure from
cigarettes.
The finding also confirms Kirk-
land's hypothesis that addiction is
more biologically based - showing
that helping people quit might not
be as easy as invoking peer pres-
sure.
"We tend to believe that we
can personally control a lot more
things than we actually can," Kirk-
land said. "Most people, if you ask
them, believe that anybody can lose
weight if they just try hard enough,
which study after study shows is
not true. And most people probably
think that they can cure themselves
of addiction if they just try hard

enough, which, again, is not true."
Part of Pomerleau's nicotine
research has illuminated posi-
tive aspects of the drug, including
evidence that the chemical plays
some role in alleviating symptoms
of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's
disease results from the death of
dopaminergic neurons, some of
which play a role in regulating
movement, which causes patients
to develop muscle spasms and trem-
ors. But since nicotine acts to pre-
venting the dopaminergic receptors
of the brain from developing insen-
sitivity, some researchers are look-
ing to a nicotine-like compound as
a potential therapy for the disease.
"The patient that I am thinking
of here in Ann Arbor was really
remarkably recovered," Pomerleau
said. "I actually have videotapes of
his being able to smile. and to be
able to move around. He traveled to
Europe ... It was quite effective."
Though Pomerleau is committed
to the field of smoking cessation, he
isn't denying that nicotine doesn't

have its positive effects. But some
may not agree with him. Pomer-
leau recalled presenting his find-
ings on pituitary hormone studies
at a tobacco research conference in
Glasgow, where he explained nico-
tine could improve performance on
tests of memory.
"I remember this very angry
person in the field of public health
saying, 'How dare you tell us things
that are good about smoking? Our
job is to banish smoking and to tell
people all the harm it does.'
"And my answer to her was that
my job in science is to tell it like it
is."
FUTURE ENDEAVORS
Warner expressed that the mis-
sion of the School of Public Health
is not to completely outlaw smoking
from the Ann Arbor grounds - not
even close.
"I don't know anybody in the pub-
lic health community of any conse-
quence who is proposing we should

ban smoking. Period," he said.
Kozak realizes that it has become
more difficult for the College Lib-
ertarians to take an active stand
against the policy now that the ban
has gone into effect.
"It seems like kind of an odd
stance to take," he admitted. "Why
stick up for this activity that we all
know is not healthy for us? Why
choose that?"
But Kozak said he is worried
about the implications of what the
ban might engender in imposing
"a system of values ... by a group of
individuals that believe they know
better." The goal of the Libertar-
ians now is not so much to actively
oppose the smoke-free initiative,
but to lead students to question the
reasons why the ban was instated in
the first place, he said.
"(Our goal) should be to chal-
lenge people to think about where
you stop," he said. "Smoking is an
easy thing to oppose. There are Lib-
ertarians who are anti-smoking, but
it's only going to bea matter of time

when people start calling into ques-
tion something you like to do with
their own point of view."
Warner doesn't take as much of a
fatalistic approach to the policy as
Kozak.
"We are certainly restricting
smoking where it can be done and
when," he said. "It's not unlike alco-
hol - there are places and times
when you can't drink. (It) doesn't
mean you can't drink alcohol, just
means you can't do it at certain
places and certain times."
Douglas echoed this sentiment,
though he expressed a more for-
ward-thinking mentality. Despite
the gains the University has made
in the field of smoking cessation, he
anticipates more work needs to be
done in the next couple years.
"We're dealing with the single-

random student interview by kaitlin williams

Welcome to the randomstu-
dent interview, where we
ask complete strangers to
validate their lives.
There's a lot of pressure on me
for this to be funny...
Funny?
Yeah. So first off, do you think
I'm funny?
Yeah.
Already? You don't even need to
hear the rest of the interview?
Yeah. You're a very animated char-
acter.
So I'm not real. I'm an animated
character. What would the name
of my show be?
Your animated show ... hmm ... have
you ever heard of "The Ugly Truth?"
No. Explain.
It's a show about the ugly truth of
what men usually find in a relation-
ship.
Oh OK, wasn't that an awful
movie with Katherine Heigl and
Gerard Butler?
Yeah.
They're not animated. So how do
I fit?
I feel like you'd be directing another
woman's perspective on that.
Oh, OK. And you got all that from
the beginning of the interview?
How insightful.

Yeah.
So, what's your favorite coffee
drink?
I like "Crammin' Caramel" from
(Bert's Cafe in) the Ugli.
OK, what's in that, other than a
shit-ton of caffeine?
(Laughs) Yeah, that's the important
part. There's caramel, white choco-
late, milk. It's not really healthy, but
that kind of stuff.
So what does that cost you?
About $7?
No, it costs I think it's three. It's
totally worth it.
Yeah that's really cheap. Who
needs food when you can get
something like that?
Yeah.
So, it's warmtoday. Shocker. How
do you feel about sunbathing in
the Diag? Is it appropriate to sun-
bathe in this weather?
Know what? I wouldn't put it past
some students here. I wouldn't.
There's going to be someone.
Where are you from originally?
20 minutes away.
Oh, so are you feeling a bit regret-
ful about staying in Michigan for
college?
No, I love Michigan. And I love my
family, so...
OK, but if you could, hypotheti-

cally, move your entire family,
where would you go?
Hmmm... Europe.
Where in Europe? Europe is pret-
ty big.
I think maybe, maybe France. I feel
like that's a sexy country.
It's sexy? Like how? Is it just the
language?
Yeah.
Do you know any French?
Yeah, I know some. I have a couple
of friends from France.
Are you happy about the trees
changing color?
Yeah. My mom says, "Tree alert," so
whenever I see a tree I'll say, "Tree
alert!" And I'll be by myself under a
red tree.
OK, that's great. Do you get
strange looks when you are doing
that?
Yeah, I do.
Do you ever worry about the
squirrels attacking you? I'm a
little afraid of the squirrels here.
They're a bit too up-close-and-per-
sonal for me.
What do you think about hunt-
ing?
Hunting. I think it's gross. I don't
think people should hunt.
Are you avegetarian?
Nope.

No? Then, if you had to, what
would you do to survive? Let's
say I dropped you in the Upper
Peninsula and you had to fend for
yourself?
I feel like I would talk to the animals
first, tell them I was sorry, and then
I'd kill them.
Don't you think that would scare
them off?
Quietly. Well, hopefully it would
scare them off so I wouldn't have to
kill them.
So you'd have to subsist on ber-
ries and twigs?
Yeah. Besides I don't really have
time between Ugli sessions to go out
and shoot deer.
How did your library session just
go?
It went well. I just went in and got
a water. I have class, and I forgot a
water.
Well I hope I'm not making you
late. Are you late for class?
Oh, no. I actually have a break.
Well if you are late it'd be a good
excuse to say you were doing a
random student interview.
Yeah.
Tell your professor it was my
fault. I'm famous, you know.
- Melanie is an LSA freshman.

conditions, she's often had to travel alone
because her partners backed out at the last
second.
But Day has never once considered cancel-
ing a trip.
"There have been several times where
I've gone, 'Eh, this is not going to be fun,' but
there was never a doubt whether I was going
to go," she said confidently.
These days, she still greets the team on the
road at their hotel. And while all she gets is
a "hug and a hi," she fondly remembers the
days she stayed up late in hotel lobbies, play-
ing cards or backgammon with the players.
She considers herself close friends with
many former players and coaches, including
former men's basketball coach Steve Fisher
and former football star Jarrett Irons.
There was also the day when former
men's basketball coach Bill Frieder called
in 1979.
"He called me in one day and asked if I
would mind sitting in the first row behind
the bench because he needed someone that
would make some noise and said that the
guys wanted me to sit there," she recalled.
For nearly every game since, Day has
sat or stood with the Maize Rage, behind
Michigan's bench.
Day's attendance isn't perfect, but she's as
close as they come.
The man behind the mask never miss-
es a chance to watch his maize-and-blue
adorned heroes on the field, ice or court. But
to some on that ice, Jeff Holzhausen is their
superhero.
The man forever known as the original
"SuperFan" considers himself just a fan, but
you'd be hard pressed to find many who've
helped the Wolverines in the way Holzhau-
sen has.
"I've had parents of (hockey) players come
up to me and say, 'Hey, you're one of the rea-
sons my kid came to Michigan,'" Holzhau-
sen said. "That happened again at the Frozen
Four this past year.
"That means the world to me. It's where

you really feel like the 12th man and you're
really having an impact on the continued
excellence of Michigan athletics."
Holzhausen, or 'Holz,' graduated from
Michigan in 1996 and has since returned for
two master's degrees. The 37 year old lives
in nearby Chelsea, where he was raised as a
Wolverine fan.
For every home game on Saturdays, Hol-
zhausen's dad would blare tracks of former
Michigan announcer Bob Ufer to wake up
his kids before the family headed to Ann
Arbor to tailgate.
His first time being a crowd favorite came
as his high school mascot- the Chelsea Bull-
dog. But that was just the beginning.
Midway through his freshman year at the
University, a cheerleader at a football game
tabbed him as "SuperFan" because of his
unique costume: a Michigan flag as a cape, a
megaphone and his signature accessory - a
winged-helmet and maize-and-blue Batman
mask.
"I've always been a big Batman fan," Hol-
zhausen said, laughing. "I love the look of it,
and it fit right in with the SuperFan, super-
hero design. It's been with me ever since."
He added a new piece to his outfit at Yost
Ice Arena: a cowbell. Today, seeing cowbells
at a Michigan sporting event doesn't draw
any double takes, but 20 years ago they were
unheard of.
That all changed with Holzhausen who,
along with two friends, introduced the cow-
bell to Wolverine fans at Yost. The SuperFan
then brought the instrument and its "go blue"
cheer to Crisler Arena and the Big House.
He was also the first to dance to the Bluse
Brothers' "Can't Turn You Loose" at Yost,
where you can still find him dancing in his

blue Grand Poobah, or water buffalo, hat.
Even the NCAA has taken notice of Hol-
zhausen. His picture is part of a longtime
exhibit in the College Football Hall of Fame,
and many of the infamous curse-filled chants
at hockey games - which also caught the
NCAA's attention - have Holzhausen and
his pals written all over them.
"I think you try wherever you go to leave
the place better than what it was when you
got there," Holzhausen said. "College foot-
ball and college sports are all about tradition,
and I had a hand in starting a few."
Foam fingers hang in his room - a con-
stant reminder that Michigan is number one.
Not that Patrick Brown needs it.
Brown, a senior in the School of Kinesiol-
ogy, is this year's SuperFan - SuperFan XI.
"If you would've asked anyone, like my
parents, they'd say I've been a Michigan
SuperFan since I was 5 years old," Brown
said. "So to be distinguished as someone like
that, it shows my dedication to the school
and the sports."
Today, the Michigan SuperFan is a posi-
tion elected by the members of Maize Rage
who choose the most diehard upperclassman
fan on campus.
"To be the SuperFan, you have to go above
and beyond your typical fan," Brown said.
"I definitely didn't get into the Maize Rage
to become the Superfan. I did it because I
love basketball. For my peers to decide that
for me, among everyone else in the Maize
Rage, it was very humbling. It was really
surreal."
Brown joined the Maize Rage during his
sophomore year, when he became a sec-
tion leader in the student section at Crisler
Arena. You can find him in the front row
wearing his infamous maize-man morph
suit, which got him plenty of notoriety that
year.

"If you asked the Maize Rage, they'd
say I'm a media whore," Brown laughed.
"They know me as 'CBS,' because there was
a game during my sophomore year against
UConn where (CBS) production manage-
ment took me on their bus and told me to go
crazy because they wanted to feature me as
the "super fan of the game."
"At every TV break, there was me going
crazy," he recalled. "They asked me to go
crazy all game."
The position comes with perks. Brown
was sent to the annual Big Ten Sportsman-
ship Conference by the University's Ath-
letic Department, which also gives him
front-row tickets to every football game.
Past SuperFans pay for Brown to attend
each away game and supply him with the
SuperFan uniform: a cape, cowbell and a
No. 11 football jersey - signifying his title
as Superfan XI.
Along with football and basketball
games, Brown can be found at hockey,
women's basketball, softball, baseball and
volleyball games and is always trying to
publicize the Maize Rage.
Brown's room is covered in Michigan
paraphernalia. Posters decorate the walls,
commemorating the Wolverines' national
championships.
"It's definitely a SuperFan-esque room,"
Brown says.
And then, there are those foam fingers.
Though they may say, "Michigan is No. 1,"
it's Brown who's the campus's current num-
ber one fan.

Fortunately for Levinson, the interviewer
was a Michigan fan.
"I am the true definition of a diehard fan,
there's no doubt about that," Levinson said.
But is he a diehard in the in the truest
meaning of the term?
When Levinson missed his last game in
1976, he was saving money to buy a house
while his wife had yet to graduate college. So
what will cause him to miss his next game?
"I'll be dead in my grave. I won't know."
Nobody's perfect. We've all been told
this. Dottie Day sure isn't perfect.
From 1972 to 2007, Day attended 1,026 of
Michigan basketball's 1,030 games. But if you
want a percentage, rounded up, you get: 100
percent (OK skeptics, it's actually 99.6 per-
cent, but who's counting?).
Day missed three games when her mom
died in 1976 and two games when her father
died in 1996. Reconstructive foot surgery
took her off the sidelines and onto her couch
for a month in 2007. Since then, her record
has been flawless.
With all the travel the 65-year-old Ann
Arbor resident does, it'd be easy to assume
she doesn't like her hometown. But in real-
ity, she loved it so much as a student that
she didn't leave after graduating in 1967 or
obtaining a master's degree in 1968.
Today, she works in the University Hospi-
tal.
"I have a tremendous, unbelievable appre-
ciation for the University in general," Day
said. "I just got so much out of my experi-
ence, and part of that was the athletics and
the contact with the athletes. I love sports -
I always have. It all mended together really
nicely."
Her affection for the men's basketball
program started with just one player - C.J.
Kupec.
During Kupec's freshman year in 1971 -
when freshmen were ineligible to play var-

sity sports - Day attended the freshman
games.
"I just thought he was the best thing since
bottled beer," Day said with a laugh. "(I
decided) that when this guy's a senior, I'm
going to go to all of the games. I did that, and
I had so much fun that I haven't stopped."
For a period during her streak, she trav-
eled with the team while serving as a men-
tor to athletes for the Athletic Department,
but the mentor program stopped in the '80s.
That didn't stop Day, who often drives to
games - home or away - by herself.
And while basketball is her first love, she
attends nearly every football game. "Except
when they interfere with basketball games."
From 1972to2007, she didn't miss a single
football game that didn't overlap with a bas-
ketball game.
Her longest trip ever, in 1983, began with a
10-hour drive to New Jersey for a basketball
game against Rutgers. She then had to hurry
to make the 36-hour drive to El Paso, Texas.
The game wasn't for another six days, but
Day had to beat the team - which flew - to
the hotel, so she could be there to greetthem.
"We got there just by the skin of our teeth
to greet the team when they arrived," she
said.
After the two-day tournament, she made
the 18-hourtrip to New Orleans forthe Sugar
Bowl. And after Michigan fell to Auburn -
the third loss she saw in five days - she made
the 18-hour return drive home.
"My friends think I'm nuts, but they also
think that it's a neat thing," Day said. "Those
that go with me say, 'Now I get it. Now I see
why you have so much fun.' But most people
think I'm crazy.
"A lot of my closest friends are men
because they appreciate the fact that, 'Hey,
here's a woman that can talk to me."'
Basketball season stretches through the
heart of Midwest winters, and Day has driv-

aspect of this policy is that it is not
formally enforced. Besides a report
to the office of Student Conflict Res-
olution and a subsequent mediation
process, students can light up within
the vicinity of classroom buildings
and still escape relatively unscathed.
According to Chief Health Officer
Robert Winfield, there have been no
incidents brought to the Office of
Student Conflict Resolution since the
ban was implemented. Nevertheless,
it's evident that the ban has not been
100 percent effective. Many-students
still smoke on the Diag and Michigan

hoping is that the policy will be
largely self-enforcing, that people

ing, that they will, in a very gentle
and friendly manner, point out that

campus," Warner said.
"And we expect people to comply."
THE CULTURE OF
HEALTIH
When news of the ban reached
public ears in April 2009, it was
met with a considerable amount of
surprise. Many questioned why the
policy was enacted and what the
University's basis was for initiating
it. Representatives from the School
of Public Health turned to the ratio-
nale that the ban was instated "to
promote a culture of health."
"Smoking is the antithesis of
health," Warner said. "It's the single-
most unhealthy behavior that people
can engage in, that many people
engage in. The notion of establishing
an environment that is free of that is
a very pro-health message."
LSA senior Graham Kozak, presi-
dent of the University's chapter of
the College Libertarians, takes issue
with the term "culture of health." He
is concerned with its vagueness, and
the ways in which it could be abused.
For Kozak, secondhand smoke
mitigation might have been a more
justifiable means to back up such a
culture - in enclosed spaces, smoke
is dangerous to the people who do
not partake in the activity and could
be construed as a "negative external-
ity." But because the University did
not delineate the definition as such,
Kozak took issue with the term's
purposeful vagueness and the ways
in which it could be abused.
"What is this 'culture of health?'"
he asked. "It's not defined, specifical-
ly. Where do you draw the line? It's a

slippery slope. Once you start intro-
ducing that for your justification of
anything, there's really nothing you
can't do."
Women's Studies Associate Prof.
Anna Kirkland, co-author of the
book "Against Health: How Health
Became the New Morality," also crit-
icized this notion, drawing on ethics
for support. Though she acknowl-
edges smoking is a dangerous habit,
Kirkland believes the broader
definition of health is much more
complicated. In her book, health
is characterized as "a term replete
with value judgments, hierarchies
and blind assumptions that speak as
much about power and privilege as
they do about well-being."_
"Against Health" further
describes the way language has been
adapted to insinuate these judg-
ments.
"We realize this dichotomy every
time we see someone smoking a ciga-
rette and reflexively say, 'Smoking is
bad for your health,' when what we
really mean is, 'You are a bad person
because you smoke,' "Prof. Jonathan
Metzl, the other co-author of the
book, writes.
Kirkland said she understands
why a culture of health could be
construed as beneficial to addictive
behaviors: The stigmatization of
smoking could potentially be moti-
vating to smokers who want to quit
but need the extra push, in addition
to preventing young people from
beginning the habit.
But she also reasoned where such.
a stigmatization could go too far.
"What about if we decided to

based on anything other than their
personal distaste for smoking. I don't
think they're looking at it from' any-
thing other than their perspective of
'smoking is one of society's greatest
evils, and it needs to be stamped out
worldwide."'
Kirkland cited Cornell Univer-
sity Prof. Richard Klein's chapter
in "Against Health" which supports
a new, more inclusive definition of
health that incorporates the seek-
ing of pleasure. Klein also wrote
the book "Cigarettes are Sublime"
in 1994 in an effort to explain the
seduction of cigarette smoking both
historically and sensually - depict-
ing the solidarity experienced when
out with peers on a lunch break and
the fiery romance associated with
the curlingtendril of a smoke ring.
"The public health moralism about
oh, how it's so bad, bad, bad - but if it
was so awful, and it were only awful,
then nobody would do it," Kirkland
said. "I've certainly felt jealous look-
ing at a smoker or looking at the
smokers all hanging out together
and enjoying their cigarettes - you
know, there's something; there that
they're enjoying that's good."
ADDICTIONAND
RESEARCH
The University upholds a strong
commitment to expanding its knowl-
edge of the effects of tobacco. Nico-
tine, the most potent and addictive
chemical component of the drug,
acts on the nicotinic cholinergic
receptors of the adrenal gland and
the brain. In large doses, it can kill

morphine and marijuana use.
Compared to other substance
abuse studies, the field of nicotine
research is relatively new. The Uni-
versity formally created a venue
for the field when Ovide Pomerleau
and his wife Cynthia brought the
Nicotine Research Laboratory to the
Department of Psychiatry in 1985.
Thanks largely to Pomerleau's
work, nicotine studies have gar-
nered a significant amount of influ-
ence within the addictive substance
sphere upon gaining the interest of
public health officials and National
Institutes of Health.
Pomerleau's motives behind pur-
suing the field of nicotine research
are threefold - to help smokers dis-
cover ways to quit, to protect people
from getting nicotine dependence
and to better understand the human
brain as a whole.
"What we're talking about now
is a basic science question: How
does the brain work?" Pomerleau
explained. "Here's the brain, here's a
tool that you can manipulate, people
self-administer this drug ... and you
can understand what the different
effects are."
Pomerleau's lab recently discov-
ered a genetic component to nicotine
dependence. Though it has long been
known that addiction to nicotine
has an extremely high heritabil-
ity - that is, it can be passed down
by family members - researchers
once believed only a few genes were
responsible for it. Upon beginning
these studies, Pomerleau presumed
that once those genes could be iden-
tified, new methods for addiction
therapy could be developed.
However, this was not the case.
What previously had been assumed
to be only a few genes influencing
nicotine dependency turned out to
be a whole network of genes dis-
persed around the human genome
interacting with each other. Any sin-
gle gene identified could not account
for the entire story of addiction.
But most surprising is what
Pomerleau calls the "triple wham-
my:" in which people susceptible to
"liking" nicotine - finding a ciga-
rette more pleasurable than displea-
surable - were found to have genes
turned on that not only increased
their likelihood to become addict-
ed to nicotine, but also genes that
increased their susceptibility to lung
cancer. This hints that perhaps genes
pertaining to the act of smoking and
enjoying smoking could somehow
be implicated in the development of

They want to hide it."

have a shaming campaign where
everybody that smokes has to wear
a T-shirt that says, 'I'm a disgusting
smoker?' " she asked. "Is that moti-
vating or are we just sort of indulging
in cruelty and stigmatizing people
who are part of our community?"
Kozak takes issue with the one-
dimensional perspective that propo-
nents of the smoking ban tend to take
toward the activity.
"They have their blinders very
firmly on," he said. "And I think they
will try to legitimize this any way
they can because they have some
very strong views not necessarily

almost immediately - but because
most cigarette companies keep their
nicotine content to doses less than 3
percent, its short-term toxicity is not
a huge concern for health officials.
Because these cholinergic recep-
tors are found all over the body, nico-
tine has been implicated in a host
of effects ranging from premature
aging, to increased blood pressure,
to weight loss. The addictive part of
nicotine is attributed to its stimula-
tion of the dopaminergic reward sys-
tem in the central nervous system,
which is also implicated in other
addictive behaviors like cocaine,
