INDIANAPOLIS — Nobody took Jim 

Harbaugh and Aidan Hutchinson 
seriously 

back in July. Yet there they were, 
sitting 

behind a podium at 
Lucas 

Oil Stadium during 
Big 

Ten Media Days, 
insisting 

the 
Michigan 
football 

team 
was 
ready 
to 

take 
the 
next 

step. 
Asked 

about 
beating 

Ohio State and 
reaching the Big 

Ten Championship 

Game, Harbaugh said 

the Wolverines would 

“get there or die trying.” 

Hutchinson, 
too, 
affirmed 

his willingness to die for it. Given 

Michigan’s dismal 2-4 season in 2020, it 

was easy to scoff at claims of culture change 
and national contention. But on Saturday 
night, their July words came to life.
The second-ranked Wolverines (12-1 overall, 

9-1 Big Ten) defeated No. 13 Iowa (10-3, 7-3), 42-3, 
capturing the program’s first Big Ten title since 
2004. When the clock ticked down to double-
zeros, maize and blue confetti rained down on the 
same field where everyone wrote off Harbaugh and 
Hutchinson in July.

“We defied all expectations,” Hutchinson said. 

“Nobody thought we could do this. Nobody thought we 

could ever do this, especially not this season. And, man, we 
did it. And we did it in a very dominant fashion.”

Standing outside the postgame locker room, shouts 
of “6-6” and “two percent” reverberated through the 

tunnel — references to the Wolverines’ projected 

6-6 record and the 2% chance ESPN’s preseason 

algorithm gave Michigan to win the Big Ten 
East. ESPN’s calculations also estimated the 

Wolverines had a 0.7% chance to win the Big 
Ten Championship and a 0.0% chance to make 
the College Football Playoff.

“There’s always that little external 

motivation,” sixth-year offensive lineman 
Andrew Vastardis said. “… Sometimes, just 
some of the stuff that’s out there, you just take 
it and ride with it and (add) fuel to the fire. So 
that’s where that was from.”

That fuel was apparent on Saturday night. 

From an identity standpoint, Michigan and the Hawkeyes 
appeared to be mirror images entering this week. Both programs 
pride themselves on physical, run-first football.

When they stepped foot on the field, however, it quickly 

became apparent that wasn’t the case. 

Iowa hadn’t allowed a run of 30-plus yards all season, but it 

didn’t take long for Blake Corum to change that. The sophomore 
running back took an inside handoff 67 yards for a touchdown on 
the Wolverines’ second possession.

On their next offensive play from scrimmage, junior 

quarterback Cade McNamara threw a lateral to running back 
Donovan Edwards in the flat. But instead of turning the corner, 
the freshman reared off his back foot and threw a deep ball to 
junior receiver Roman Wilson, who ran streaking behind the 
defense all alone. The double-pass went for a 75-yard touchdown, 
giving Michigan a quick two-score lead.

“(That play) has been ready for prime time about seven weeks,” 

Harbaugh said. “… We had it planned early. As soon as we got into 
the left hash after the fourth play, we were going to run that. And 
(Edwards) has never missed on that throw. Sometimes he throws 
it off his left, his right foot. He’s always on the move running when 
he throws it. And every time, it’s a dime.”

On the other side of the ball, that was more than the they needed.

After allowing a field goal late in the first quarter, Michigan’s 
defense gave up just 160 more yards. The Wolverines held Iowa to 
a 5-for-18 mark on third down and didn’t surrender a single point 
following the first frame. Hutchinson recorded four tackles, a sack 
and two quarterback hurries en route to Big Ten Championship 
Game MVP honors. He’s the first defensive player to ever win the 
award, but his teammates believe he belongs in the conversation 
for a bigger one.

“It’s pretty self-explanatory. He deserves to be the Heisman 

Trophy winner,” Vastardis said. “He showed out every week, 
been a game-changer.” 

Senior running back Hassan Haskins padded the Wolverines’ 

lead with a pair of second-half rushing touchdowns, becoming 
the first player in program history to tally 20 in a single-season. 
Michigan’s 42 points were the most the Hawkeyes’ vaunted defense 
had allowed since the 2015 Rose Bowl, sealing their worst postseason 
losing margin in program history.

Saturday’s victory cements the Wolverines’ first-ever College 

Football Playoff berth, helping Harbaugh restore his alma 
mater’s place in the upper echelon of college football. Prior to 
2021, Michigan’s seventh-year coach had yet to beat Ohio State, 
claim a conference title or lead his team to the College Football 
Playoff. The fact that he checked all three of those boxes during 
the past week solidifies this season as an inflection point for the 
program.

Most players on the Wolverines’ roster hadn’t even started 

elementary school the last time Michigan won a Big Ten title. 
Now, that drought is over. And it ended in the very stadium where 
nobody thought it was possible in July.

That is, except for Harbaugh, Hutchinson and the rest of the 

Wolverines.


In light of the University of Michi-

gan’s commitment to achieve carbon 
neutrality for both on-campus and 
purchased-power emissions by 2040, 
community members are consider-
ing how the University can introduce 
more energy-efficient lighting proce-
dures.

Multiple buildings and common 

areas across campus close each night 
and remain inaccessible to students, 
staff and faculty, but continue to be 
lit with the same light intensity as 
during business hours, according 
to Kevin Morgan, manager of the 
Energy Management Program at 
the Office of Campus Sustainability. 
Individual students or staff cannot 
turn these lights off — they are gen-
erally managed by facilities staff in 
each building.

Electricity generated to illumi-

nate these interiors on campus falls 
under Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
This means that emissions associ-
ated with lighting are produced by 
electricity from both the University’s 
own power plant and purchases from 
other energy utilities.

Why does the University leave 

these lights on? And are there ways 
the campus could be lit in a more effi-
cient way? 

Safety, campus environment and 

architecture

It’s unclear exactly how much 

lighting 
accounts 
for 
electric-

ity usage and carbon emissions from 
buildings on campus. The U.S. Ener-
gy Information Administration cited 
data from a survey indicating light-
ing accounts for 17% of the electricity 
consumed in U.S. commercial build-
ings, but the survey does not break 
down how much of that demand 
comes from lights left on beyond 
business hours. 

In an email to The Daily, Univer-

sity spokesperson Kim Broekhuizen 
said the amount of electricity used 
for lighting varies across buildings, 

making it difficult to quantify the 
impact overnight lights have on ener-
gy consumption.

“Energy use from lighting can 

vary based on a building’s design, 
age, lighting code at the time of con-
struction or renovation, and lighting 
system updates,” Broekhuizen said.

Morgan said the primary rea-

son lights are left on in buildings is 
for safety purposes. He said even 
if a building is closed to the public, 
these “uncontrollable lights” need 
to remain on so maintenance facili-
ties staff can safely enter or exit the 
buildings if they need to address 
emergency electrical issues.

“By code, we need to assume 

someone is in there, and we need to 
make sure they can get out safely,” 
Morgan said.

Morgan referred to the Michigan 

Building Code, which requires com-
mon spaces to provide a minimum 
amount of “emergency lighting” 
for individuals to traverse through 
spaces such as hallways and stairs. 
These rules apply to recently con-
structed buildings but are not neces-
sarily required of older buildings on 
campus. 

The code also mandates that 

lights remain active 24/7, meaning a 
minimum amount of light is required 
in on-campus common areas even 
when the building is closed to the 
public.

Unless a building is being decom-

missioned, such as being set for a 
renovation or demolition, Morgan 
said the University legally cannot 
deactivate lighting systems for com-
mon spaces, even if nobody is inhab-
iting them.

Broekhuizen said the University is 

open to energy conservation sugges-
tions from the community.

“We appreciate the U-M com-

munity helping us to identify ways 
to reduce our energy use, and in the 
case of lighting, noting when lights 
should be turned off if not necessary 
for safety or wayfinding,” Broekhui-
zen said.

CSG Vice President Carla Voigt, 

an Engineering senior, told The Daily 
in a message that the University 
could do more to turn these lights off.

“I think as many lights as possible 

should be turned off to reduce light 
pollution and energy waste,” Voigt 
said. “The safety of our students 
is incredibly important. However, 
there are many places on campus 
with lights on that aren’t necessary 
for safety, such as inside empty build-
ings or other non-populated areas.”

Voigt was previously a campaign 

manager for the CSG party Rep-
resent Michigan, which proposed 
turning off the lights at the Michigan 
Stadium as a sustainability measure. 
The stadium’s lights remain on over-
night, and athletics officials have 
previously stated the lights need to 
stay on for “safety and security pur-
poses.”

While building codes mandate 

many spaces remain illuminated, 
Morgan noted some lights may be 
deliberately left on as a choice of 
the building designer to highlight 
architectural features. He suggested 
that lights might be left on at Ross to 
emphasize the glass box design fea-
tures.

In an email to The Daily, Grant 

Faber, a U-M alum who contrib-
uted to the Student Advisory Panel 
of the President’s Commission on 
Carbon Neutrality and has worked 
in sustainability and carbon capture 
research, said lights may often be 
left on to create the feeling of a living 
campus environment to community 
members. 

There are multiple energy conser-

vation measures that increase energy 
efficiency, such as installing LED 
lights to replace fluorescent lights, 
which consume more electricity. 
Morgan said fluorescent lights are 
currently the most common type of 
light used on campus. 

Morgan said the University gen-

erally requires new construction 
projects to utilize LED lighting, and 
multiple University units have been 
updating their lighting fixtures in 
recent years. For the lights that are 

required to be left on, Morgan said 
these efficiency improvements could 
be valuable in reducing energy con-
sumption. 

“We know that that light needs to 

be delivered to that space, so we’ll do 
our best to make it as efficient as pos-
sible,” Morgan said. “That’s the best 
we can do.”

Adam Simon, professor of earth 

and environmental sciences, said 
another option to reduce unneces-
sary lighting is to install sensors 
that turn lights off when there’s no 
movement in the room. Many class-
rooms and offices already contain 
sensors that perform this function. 
Simon said sensors help the Univer-
sity “circumvent human behavior” 
when individuals forget to turn off 
lights.

“What you’re doing there is you’re 

bypassing having students do it,” 
Simon said. “You don’t need humans 
to make that decision. It’s just done 
by the silent hand behind the scenes.”

To pay for these kinds of upgrades, 

the University proposed a revolv-
ing energy fund as part of its car-
bon neutrality announcement. The 
fund would allow the University to 
finance investments in energy con-
servation, such as LED lighting and 
motion sensors, and regain the funds 
through the cost savings generated 
by these investments. 

Simon said using this approach 

was “low-hanging fruit” that could 
also create funds to go toward spend-
ing for students, including schol-
arships. He noted that Harvard 
University had implemented a simi-
lar energy fund years ago.

“The revolving energy fund cer-

tainly is something that myself and 
many colleagues on campus really 
advocated for, because other univer-
sities have quantified cost savings … 
(and have) reduced annual energy 
costs,” Simon said. “That allows you 
to have more discretionary revenue 
for other things that benefit students, 
and you reduce emissions.”

UMich removes two questions related to job 
applicants’ criminal history

Questions will still be asked during background check after accepting offer

PUBLIC SAFETY

In early November, the University 

of Michigan announced they would 
remove two questions related to 
job applicants’ criminal history and 
background.

These two questions previously 

asked if applicants have “been 
convicted of a misdemeanor or felony, 
including alcohol- or drug-related 
driving offenses” and if there are any 
felony charges currently pending 
against them. 

The University will still ask these 

questions 
during 
a 
background 

check after the job applicant has 
accepted the position, according to 
the University Record. 

The decision follows calls from 

criminal justice activists and student 

organizations to “ban the box,” which 
refers to employers that ask applicants 
to check a box indicating whether 
they have any criminal charges. In 
Aug. 2020, the University removed 
questions asking applicants about 
misdemeanor charges in applications 
for admission to the University.

University 
spokesperson 
Kim 

Broekhuizen told The Michigan Daily 
in an email that the decision was 
made to encourage job seekers by not 
initially disclosing their background 
to the University.

“The point of it is to conduct job 

interviews first and select candidates 
that 
are 
well 
qualified 
before 

conducting a background check and 
considering whether any convictions 
are job-related,” Broekhuizen said. 
“The process helps protect job 
candidates from disqualification based 
on a non-job-related conviction, and 

it helps job seekers simply feel more 
confident about applying without 
upfront disclosures that might cause 
good candidates to never apply.”

Broekhuizen 
also 
said 
the 

University studied other employers 
that removed this question from their 
application process, which ultimately 
encouraged them to do the same. 
Broekhuizen wrote in her email that 
the University’s decision to remove 
the two questions was not a result of 
campus activism.

“This change resulted from the 

desire to assess and recognize the 
impact on equity and inclusion 
in 
the 
University’s 
employment 

process. Although there is activist 
activity locally and nationally in 
support of banning the box, the 
University’s decision wasn’t related 
to campus activism or organizations,” 
Broekhuizen said.

Matthew 
Lassiter, 
history 

professor and co-director of the 
Carceral State Project, has been 
advocating for this change since 2019 
when he helped draft an open letter 
EditSign criticizing the University for 
implementing a new felony disclosure 
policy. The policy, known as SPG 
601.38, took effect in Feb. 2019 and 
requires all community members 
to report any felony convictions or 
charges to the University within a 
week or face penalties. 

Lassiter said the decision to 

remove the two questions is a step in 
the right direction, but said he was 
disappointed by how long it took 
to make the change and worries 
that it may not do enough to make a 
significant improvement.

The University of Michigan 

Diag was illuminated by a string of 
tealight candles the evening of Dec. 
2 as community members gathered 
to mourn and commemorate the 
four lives lost in the Oxford High 
School shooting on Nov. 30, where a 
15-year-old sophomore opened fire 
in what would become the deadliest 
K-12 school shooting since 2018. 

Three students spoke at the 

event: Public Policy junior Alyssa 
Donovan, LSA junior Mckenzie 
Miller 
and 
LSA 
junior 
Josh 

Winslow. Donovan and Miller are 
graduates of Oxford High School.

Prior to the speeches, organizers 

and 
other 
supporters 
walked 

around and lit small handheld 
candles for attendees to hold. 
The speakers stood on the steps 
in front of the Hatcher Graduate 
Library and attendees gathered 
around to listen to them through a 
megaphone.

During her speech, Donovan 

expressed her and other organizers’ 

support for the members of the 
Oxford community.

“The reasons for our gathering, 

our shared experiences of trauma 
and loss to gun violence, are 
devastating,” Donovan said. “We 
are here today to relay our support 
for the community of Oxford, for my 
community and the community of so 
many here gathered today.”

Donovan continued, telling the 

Oxford community that the U-M 
community stands with them in 
their time of grief.

“We’re 
here 
to 
show 
the 

community of Oxford that the 
University of Michigan, the state 
and the country share our pain, our 
sorrow, our devastation and our 
loss,” Donovan said. “We’re here to 
support us through it. We are here to 
offer our thoughts and our prayers. 
We’re here to reach out to others 
being brought together in our shared 
grief.”

Miller pointed out the tight-knit 

nature of Oxford and explained the 
shock she felt when she learned that 
her hometown was the location of 
the attack. 

“Oxford’s a small town,” Miller 

said. “It’s the kind of place where 
you go to Meijer with your friends 
on a Saturday night. McDonald’s 
before every football game. It’s a 
place where people grow up and they 
come back to raise families. Oxford’s 
been changed forever.”

In an interview with The Daily, 

Miller said she initially found out 
about the shooting from a friend. 
Miller said she then received a text 
message from her sister, who is a 
sophomore at Oxford High School, 
telling Miller that she loved her.

“I actually got a text from her 

… to me and my other sister, and it 
just said ‘I love you guys,’” Miller 
said. “I was, at that point, trying to 
figure out what was going on and I 
was panicked. ‘What do you mean? 
What’s going on?’ And then she just 
said ‘There’s a shooter in the school. 
I love you guys so much.’ And then I 
didn’t hear from her for another 30 
minutes.”

During her speech, Miller went 

into more detail about how she’s 
been feeling all week following the 
shooting.

“I can’t explain what it feels like 

to receive those ‘I love you’ texts. 

What it was like to see your small 
hometown high school trending on 
Twitter,” Miller said. “I don’t know 
how to explain how any of this 
feels, and I truly hope no one else 
will ever have to understand. I’m 
not okay, but it breaks my heart to 
know that what I’m feeling is only 
a small fraction of all the students 
and staff that were in that school.”

Miller said that, right now, her 

focus is on mourning the lives lost 
and respecting those affected.

“I know that many of us, myself 

included, are feeling a range of 
emotions these past few days,” 
Miller said. “Anger, confusion, 
resentment, denial, just sadness. 
And there will be time for all of 
those emotions to run their course 
and make these necessary talks and 
actions. But right now, it is time to 
grieve. Feel pain and sadness for all 
those affected. To give support and 
prayers for Madisyn Baldwin, Hana 
St. Juliana, Justin Shilling and Tate 
Myre. Four students, four kids, who 
will always be remembered.”

The Coalition for Re-envi-

sioning Our Safety, a multira-
cial group of faith leaders, social 
workers, health care workers, 
researchers and activists who 
support building a “care-based” 
community, are currently work-
ing to develop a plan for an 
unarmed public safety response 
program in Ann Arbor that was 
approved in an April City Council 
meeting.

In April, The Ann Arbor City 

Council passed a resolution call-
ing for an unarmed public safety 
response program to send pub-
lic health experts to non-violent 
emergency calls in place of the 
police. This program aims to help 
individuals who do not feel com-
fortable calling the police for help 
or need professional help with 
issues such as mental health. 

The program aims to expand 

the work of public health provid-
ers by having a comprehensive 
program that directs resources 
to those in need, according to 
the resolution. Ann Arbor City 
Councilmember Kathy Griswold, 
D-Ward 2, said she supports this 
program because there needs to 
be a more proactive approach on 
providing care for marginalized 
communities. 

“There has been talk about this 

for a few years in many commu-
nities, and the general approach 
rather than being punitive (is) to 
be more proactive so that we can 
reduce actions with police offi-
cers,” Griswold said.

Lee Roosevelt, clinical assis-

tant professor in the School of 
Nursing, is a member of CROS. 
She said the coalition is about 
people coming together to help 
the community. 

“In April, when the city put 

together this resolution, we all got 
together and decided to combine 

forces and really organize to make 
sure that this is a comprehensive 
program now that we have the 
city backing for it,” Roosevelt said.

CROS’ core values include 

ensuring non-police profession-
als are responding to non-violent 
emergencies under this program. 
They believe that the police can 
cause significant harm in the com-
munity and cannot be re-trained 
to take care of sensitive cases. 

Part of the group’s goals 

includes ensuring these public 
health professionals are separated 
from the criminal legal system. 
They must also be trained on a 
variety of issues such as mental 
health, homelessness and emo-
tional abuse.

Washtenaw County has seen 

multiple instances of police bru-
tality in recent years, including 
the death of Aura Rosser, a Black 
woman killed by Ann Arbor police 
officers in 2014. Last year, amid 
heightened awareness around 
police brutality and racial injus-
tice, millions of Americans pro-
tested for Black Lives Matter 
across the country, including in 
Ann Arbor. 

Roosevelt said the police are 

not always trained for emergen-
cies such as mental health in ways 
that other professionals are, and 
therefore should not be the ones 
responding to people who need 
help with those issues. 

“The police are not social work-

ers, and we are asking them to 
behave as social workers instead 
of doing what they are trained to 
do,” Roosevelt said. 

Roosevelt said the program 

needs to be run by an independent 
nonprofit organization in order to 
ensure separation from other city 
departments. 

“The big thing is that it has to 

have city (administration) support 
and be funded by the city, but it 
needs to not be embedded in the 
police department of the city, it 

needs to be really separate,” Roo-
sevelt said.

Roosevelt also said this pro-

gram could be beneficial to 
individuals who do not feel com-
fortable asking the police for help.

“We have a large portion of the 

community that has very chal-
lenging and problematic inter-
actions with the police, and just 
won’t call 911,” Roosevelt said. 
“Part of the police department is 
not going to be utilized by the por-
tions of our community that are 
asking for something that is sepa-
rate and different.”

is leading a lawsuit that aims to 
change the way the University 
handles sexual assault cases. This 
class action lawsuit was filed in 
May 2021 on behalf of hundreds of 
survivors of former athletic doctor 
Robert Anderson. 

Graham volunteers at Youth 

Arts Alliance and Telling It, a 
“trauma-informed” after-school 
program for children in the 
community,and works at Ground-
cover News, a local nonprofit 
street newspaper publishing sto-
ries related to homelessness and 
poverty. Graham said that based 
on her experience working with 
marginalized communities and 
learning about the criminal jus-
tice system, she believes there is 
a strong distrust between mar-
ginalized communities and the 
police. 

“You just look at all the data 

and hear all the stories, and most 
importantly see first hand by 
working with communities most 
impacted,” Graham said. “You 
see that they all have a very strong 
distrust in the police because, as I 
believe, the system has been bro-
ken from the start.” 

The resolution also requests 

a separate call number differ-
ent from 911. Roosevelt said the 
reasoning for the separate num-
ber is to avoid confusion for the 

emergency dispatch if the caller is 
requesting an unnamed response.

CROS’ proposal was inspired 

by other unarmed public safety 
response programs that have been 
successful. Some of those exam-
ples are located in Eugene, Ore.; 
Denver, Colo.; Olympia, Wash.; 
San Francisco, Calif. and Austin, 
Texas, among other cities.

The City Council resolution 

aims to complete developing the 
plan this month. The program will 
have a budget of $3 million, given 
by the city administration to the 
unarmed response organization. 

“When you compare it to 

the $30 million fund the police 
department gets, it’s actually a 
very low budget,” Roosevelt said. 

Griswold said the pilot for 

testing the program would start 
within two years, which is the 
minimum funding period for the 
program. 

“If we can get the pilot started 

mid-2022, I would be very satis-
fied,” Griswold said. “We do have 
models already in other commu-
nities, so we can modify them to 
meet Ann Arbor’s needs.”

Regarding how the program 

would be received by the com-
munity, Graham said building 
trust with the community would 
require hard work and time. 
In order for the program to be 
effective, the organization needs 
to 
have 
a 
community-based 

approach that listens to the peo-
ple’s voices, Graham said. 

“This is an ongoing process 

because trust doesn’t come in 
unity,” Graham said. “It requires 
us to be intentional in the ways 
we engage most directly with 
people impacted by these issues … 
They are great ideas, but they are 
not implemented in a way that is 
focused on the community.”

CAMPUS LIFE

Jonathan Vaughn wears many 

hats. He is a former collegiate athlete, 
a survivor of the late University of 
Michigan 
athletic 
doctor 
Robert 

Anderson and a business owner. Vaughn 
has been camping outside University 
President Mark Schlissel’s house for 
more than 50 days in protest of the 
University’s handling of the hundreds 
of sexual assault allegations against 
Anderson.

Now, he is also a self-announced 

candidate for the 2022 election for the 
U-M Board of Regents. He announced 
his run at the Nov. 13 “Survivors Speak 
Up” forum.

Vaughn said his reason for running 

for the Board of Regents is simple: the 
current regents have failed at their 
stated mission of “developing leaders 
and citizens.” In an interview with The 
Daily, Vaughn said the University’s 
handling of past and current sexual 
assault cases and the administration’s 
marginalization of students of color are 
all examples of the failing of the Board 
of Regents. 

Since his announcement on day 36 

of his planned 100-day protest, Vaughn 
has continued his protest outside of 
Schlissel’s house. On day 41, The Daily 
sat down with Vaughn about what he 
wants to accomplish as regent and why 
he is running. 

Vaughn said his experience as a 

football player at the University in the 
late 1980s and his return to campus 
in 2020 as a vocal advocate for sexual 
assault survivors show that he has the 
commitment necessary to represent 
the campus community on the Board of 
Regents. 

“I’ll put my love for this University 

up against any other regents,” Vaughn 
said. “All the sacrifices I’ve made for this 
University during my time here, I never 
question that I am a Michigan Man 
through and through.”

Vaughn’s goals as regent would be to 

engage with the people of the University 
and to prioritize campus safety. 

Through his protests on South 

University Avenue, Vaughn said he 
has had extraordinary access to U-M 
students. Vaughn estimated he has 
talked to 4000 or 5000 people and 
said the general disappointment in the 
University regents and administration is 
a common talking point.

“There’s 
an 
overwhelming 

unfavorable opinion or response from the 
students and the faculty in the office of 
the president and administration and the 
Board of Regents,” Vaughn said. “There is 
a loss of hope that the current leadership 
will protect, inspire and empower.”

This is particularly true in the era of 

the Anderson case, which may be the 
largest sexual abuse scandal by a single 
person in the documented history of 
the United States with thousands of 
complaints filed. Other U-M staff and 
faculty have been recently accused of 
sexual misconduct, including former 
violin professor Stephen Shipps, former 
computer science professors Walter 
Lasecki and Peter Chen, computer 
science professor Jason Mars, former 
American Culture professor Bruce 
Conforth and former Provost Martin 
Philbert, among others.

Vaughn said the regents haven’t 

taken responsibility for the actions of the 
University in dismissing and covering 
up the Anderson abuse complaints. 
While Schlissel and the regents have 
heard from survivors at Board of 
Regents meetings, Schlissel has not 
directly spoken to the protesters outside 
of his home. 

Mike Cox, Vaughn’s attorney in 

the Anderson litigation and former 
Michigan attorney general, said that 
Vaughn would succeed as regent.

“He not only loves the University as 

an institution and for its traditions, and 
more importantly, he is focused on what 
is best for its current and future students,” 
Cox said. “By that I mean he knows the 
University is organic and to grow it must 
focus on its students. Further, he is smart, 
a hard worker and a critical thinker — all 
good things for a regent.”

The current Board of Regents 

is primarily focused on money and 
endowment growth, Vaughn said. As 
regent, Vaughn said he would not be 
concerned about money, stating that he 
“will not be bought.” Instead, Vaughn 
said he would direct the Board toward 
greater transparency and more frequent 
auditing of the services provided to the 
students. 

“Universities can’t be the Titanic in 

today’s age because the Titanic is not 
agile,” Vaughn said. “We must become 

more agile in (our) thinking, more 
creative in (our) thinking. We must be 
able to take a top-down and a bottom-
up view of everything. And so not only 
thinking about the long term financial 
welfare of the University, but the 
services that you provide here.”

Vaughn said that part of his goal 

in running for regent is to educate the 
public on the role of the board and their 
election process. He said that most 
students he speaks with do not know 
that the regents are a public office 
elected in statewide elections. 

History 
professor 
Terrence 

McDonald, director of the Bentley 
Historical Library, said the Board 
of Regents effectively functions as a 
board of directors at a large corporation 
with the president acting as CEO. The 
selection of the University president is 
one of the main roles of the regents.

Historically, the most frequent 

occupation for regent is lawyer, 
McDonald said. This holds true today: 
six of the eight current regents are 
lawyers and the other two have degrees 
in business.

Vaughn says he is undaunted by 

his different professional background, 
saying that it will give him an advantage 
in representing the community. After 
attending the University, Vaughn spent 
a decade playing football professionally 
for the National Football League. For the 
last 18 years, Vaughn has been co-CEO 
of a Florida-based hospitality company 
with his brother, Britt Vaughn.

“I know people,” Vaughn said. “I 

have critical thinking skills and thrive 
under pressure and understand what 
true team play is. And at some point 
in time, your moral compass has to be 
greater than your legal compass in the 
way that you think and the way that 
you handle things because we’re talking 
about people’s lives.”

Vaughn has not yet announced 

what political party he will run with. 
Typically, the state political parties 
nominate their candidates for regent at 
the state convention prior to elections. 

McDonald said no one has ever won 

a seat on the Board of Regents with a 
political party other than the traditional 
Republican or Democrat. 

“One could imagine an independent 

campaign,” 
McDonald 
said. 
“It’s 

certainly possible, but you would have 
to figure out how you would somehow 
get your name out. You wouldn’t get 
anybody’s publicity. And independent 
candidacy is hard.”

Vaughn would need to obtain 

12,000-24,000 votes if he does not run 
with a traditional party affiliation and 
would need to file before July 21, 2022 
to get a place on the statewide ballot. A 
case, Graveline v. Benson, is currently 
pending before the 6th Circuit US 
Court of Appeals to reduce the number 
of signatures to 12,000 given that “no 
independent candidate for statewide 
office ha(d) ever satisfied Michigan’s 
current statutory scheme to qualify for 
the ballot over the preceding 30 years.” 

“Whatever party I choose, or 

independent, I will not be bought,” 
Vaughn said. “I cannot be bought off of 
someone else’s agenda. I’m not asking 
for a handout to be a regent. I see issues 
that I think I can directly help solve. 
And the people who support me love 
this University (and want) to get back to 
being leaders and best.”

The University’s chapter of College 

Democrats issued their support for 
Vaughn’s decision to run for Board of 
Regents in a statement to The Daily. 

“We support Jon Vaughn’s decision 

to run for a position on the University’s 
Board of Regents because of his 
dedication to making this campus a 
better and safer place for all,” the 
statement reads. “We also would like 
to emphasize our support for the work 
he and other survivors of sexual assault 
have been doing to keep our campus safe 
and advocate for the needs of the student 
body.”

Ryan Fisher, the spokesperson for 

the University’s chapter of College 
Republicans and LSA senior, said the 
Republican businesswoman Lauren 
Hantz is the only candidate for regent 
that they currently support. 

“Vaughn has been a proponent of 

the University of Michigan community 
for a long time,” Fisher said. “With that 
said, we are going to hold off until he 
announces more of his platform and 
policy goals. (We) would love to see 
an emphasis on financial restraint, 
quelling the ongoing tuition increases, 
and protecting free speech for all on 
campus.”

Students gathered on the Diag on Dec. 2 to grieve the victims of the Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School. 

Sophomore opened fire on Nov. 30, killing four students and injuring seven others


In 
early 
November, 
the 

University of Pioneer High School 
parent Charmelle Kelsey filed a 
Freedom of Information Act lawsuit 
against the Ann Arbor Public 
Schools on Nov. 30, in the latest of 
several attempts to make AAPS 
acknowledge racial disparities in 
their school system. The suit claims 
AAPS withheld public documents 
Kelsey believed would provide 
evidence of racial discrimination at 
Pioneer High School, according to 
a press release from the University 
of Michigan Civil Rights Litigation 
Initiative. 

In August 2020, the CRLI 

sent a letter to AAPS on behalf 
of Charmelle and her daughter, 
then-Pioneer High School student 
Makayla Kelsey. The letter claims 
that a pattern of institutional racism 
exists at Pioneer High School, based 
on interviews conducted with the 
Kelseys and other students of color. 

Earlier this year, Charmelle 

Kelsey and Makayla Kelsey filed 
a Family Educational Rights and 
Privacy Act complaint with the 
U.S. Department of Education 
and another complaint with the 
Michigan Department of Civil 
Rights against AAPS. The FERPA 
investigation 
concluded 
earlier 

this year when AAPS admitted 

that Pioneer High School teacher 
Michele Macke violated federal 
law by displaying students’ grades 
on a public SmartBoard. The 
Department of Education closed 
its 
investigation 
after 
AAPS 

acknowledged fault and it was 

ensured Ms. Macke underwent 
additional FERPA training. The 
Michigan Department of Civil 
Rights investigation is still ongoing. 

There 
are 
currently 
two 

petitions circulating calling for 
the removal of Ms. Macke from 
Pioneer High School. The petitions 
cite Ms. Macke’s history of racial 
antagonism and claim she has 
created a hostile environment for 
students. Combined, the petitions 
have amassed more than 1,000 
signatures. 

Charmelle 
Kelsey 
filed 
the 

most recent lawsuit after the Ann 
Arbor School District did not 
provide documents in response 
to FOIA requests she submitted 
on August 30, 2021, in a timely 
manner. Kelsey submitted the 
FOIA requests to determine if 
photographs of the Black Student 
Union’s senior members were 
excluded from the 2020 yearbook, 
why the Black Student Union was 
excluded from the 2020 yearbook, 
if there are discrepancies between 
disciplinary actions taken against 
white students and students of 
color and to obtain the terms of 
engagement between AAPS and the 
Dykema Gossett law firm hired to 
investigate racial hostilities in the 
AAPS system. 

Charmelle Kelsey also hoped 

the documents requested under the 
FOIA would provide information on 
why Ms. Macke, the teacher found 
guilty of violating the FERPA, was 
the only faculty member to greet 
and shake hands with seniors at 
Pioneer High School’s graduation 
ceremony. 

“We’re tired of Pioneer High 

School whitewashing over the race 
discrimination that our children 
must deal with,” Charmelle Kelsey 

said in the press release. “The 
school doesn’t want to give us 
the information we’re asking for 
because it would show everyone 
how bad things have been for 
Makayla and the other Black 
students and how little the school 
has done to stop it.”

Under 
FOIA, 
government 

agencies, upon receiving a request, 
must provide public documents 
within a reasonable time and a 
reasonable 
estimate 
by 
which 

the documents will be fulfilled. 
According to the lawsuit, AAPS did 
not provide the required estimate. 

Charmelle Kelsey’s attorneys 

inquired into when they could 
expect AAPS to produce the 
documents on October 26, 2021, 
and AAPS did not respond to that 
inquiry, the lawsuit alleges. Since 
the FOIA request was submitted, 
AAPS has provided only one 
allegedly incomplete document in 
response to Charmelle Kelsey’s 23 
requests, according to the Kelseys’ 
attorneys.

Ben 
Mordechai-Stongin, 
a 

student attorney with the Civil 
Rights Initiative at the University 
of Michigan Law School, which is 
representing Charmelle Kelsey in 
her suit, said in the press release 
this is a part of AAPS’s history of 
avoiding issues related to alleged 
racial hostility within its schools. 

“The District’s failure to comply 

with state law and provide these 
documents is consistent with a 
pattern of hiding racial problems 
at the school,” Mordechai-Strongin 
said in the press release.

NEWS BRIEFS

Ann Arbor Public Schools 

will close Friday, Dec. 3 due 
to threats of violence made 
against the district on social 
media, AAPS Superintendent 
Jeanice 
Swift 
announced 

in an email to families the 
 

night of Dec. 2. A copy of this 
email was obtained by The 
Michigan Daily.

Swift 
wrote 
that 
the 

district 
received 
notice 

of numerous social media 
posts threatening potential 
violence and chose to close all 
schools “out of an abundance 
of caution.”

“While these posts have 

not been determined to be 
credible at this time, the 
volume is quite high,” Swift 
wrote in her Dec. 2 email. 
“Closing schools will allow 
school administrators and law 
enforcement an opportunity 
to investigate all reported 
concerns.”

Schools around southeast 

Michigan have been on high-
alert on Dec. 2 following the 
deadly shooting at Oxford 
High School in Oxford, Mich. 
on Nov. 30. Four Oxford High 
School students were killed 
after a 15-year old sophomore 
student 
opened 
fire 
the 

morning of Nov. 30, injuring 

six other students and one 
teacher. The suspect, Ethan 
Crumbley, 
currently 
faces 

terrorism and first degree 
murder charges. 

Following 
the 
shooting, 

over a dozen schools in the 
metro Detroit area closed on 
Dec. 2 in response to possible 
threats on social media. 

AAPS remained open on 

Dec. 2 but expressed support 
for students and families who 
have decided to stay home 
due to concerns over threats 
to schools in the district 
over social media, according 
to emails from Swift and 
Huron High School Principal 
Ché Carter obtained by The 
Daily. Approximately half of 
students reportedly stayed 
home 
from 
Pioneer 
High 

School, 
according 
to 
the 

student news site The Pioneer 
Optimist.

Students at Dexter High 

School and Huron High School 
participated in walkouts on 
Dec. 2 to advocate against 
gun violence. Other schools, 
including 
Pioneer 
High 

School, organized a “blue and 
gold day” to show support for 
the Oxford community.

Swift 
told 
the 
AAPS 

community 
in 
a 
Dec. 
2 

morning 
email 
that 
the 

district 
would 
increase 

police presence in schools 
Dec. 2. In the afternoon, 
Swift sent another email to 
families, saying the district 
is working with the Ann 

Arbor 
Police 
Department, 

Washtenaw County Sheriff, 
the University of Michigan 
Division 
of 
Public 
Safety 

and Security, Michigan State 
Police and the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation to monitor 
social 
media 
threats 
and 

ensure the safety of students 
and staff.

“We understand the very 

real pressure and fear that 
many students are feeling and 
know that our parents and 
staff are equally concerned,” 
Swift wrote in the Dec. 2 
afternoon email. “We also 
understand the priority of 
attending school every day 
when we can safely do so; we 
want our students learning 
in our AAPS classrooms. We 
remain committed to our 
relationship with local law 
enforcement, who take every 
report or rumor seriously and 
investigate immediately, so 
that we can safely convene 
school.” 

The 
district 
has 
faced 

backlash from Ann Arbor 
community 
members 
in 

recent 
months 
due 
to 

increased 
school 
closures 

due to staffing shortages and 
COVID-19 concerns.

Arts

I’m the kind of person who looks for 

herself when she reads. I want so badly 
to find bits of myself in characters that 
I love. From Hermione Granger to 
Lizzy Bennet, I crave a connection to 
beloved characters, so much so that 
I force similarities. I try to become 
the characters instead of finding a 
natural connection, instead of finding 
something real.

And then I read Uzma Jalaluddin’s 

“Hana Khan Carries On.” 

I’ve seen attempts at Muslim 

representation in art in the past 
and 
have 
almost 
always 
been 

wholeheartedly disappointed. Seeing 
the trope of “Muslim girls gone wild,” 
taking their hijabs off and straying 
from the religious morals, troubles me. 
In other cases, the characters face a 
great, dramatic internal conflict, where 
they agonize over whether or not they 
can be both a desi Muslim and an 
American student — something along 
those lines. I’ve never felt this pressure 
about maintaining both aspects of 

my identity. There are probably desi 
Muslim girls who do face these issues 
or who are in these situations; it’s just 
not how I’ve grown up. It’s not who I 
am. So where’s the representation for 
the kind of Muslim I am? 

I’m a 21st century Pakistani-

American girl who was born and 
raised in Michigan. I have a connection 
to my culture, but it feels strained 
at times, feeling more surface-level 
than anything else because of the 
Americanization I’ve been accustomed 
to all my life. I’m lucky enough to hold 
a stronger connection to my religion: 

Islam is a constant in my life. There are 
aspects of being a Muslim girl that are 
hard, I’ll be the first to admit. Being the 
only kid in school wearing long sleeves 
and pants instead of tank tops and 
shorts was rough — it can get really hot, 
really fast. I would fast in Ramadan, 
feeling my mouth water when I saw my 
friends snacking. But all of these things 
feel remarkably small in the grand 
scheme of things. So what if my life 
was a little different than my friends? I 
was lucky enough to have friends that 
accepted me and loved me the way 
that I was, regardless of cultural and 
religious differences. I have a family 
that loves and supports me. I work 
hard. I do well. I do good. 

And yet, I still craved something. 

Understanding, maybe. 

It’s taken 20 years, but I’ve found it. 
“Hana Khan Carries On” is a 

retelling of the 1998 film “You’ve 
Got Mail,” following the Indian-
Canadian hijabi Hana Khan as she 
works to accurately represent herself 
and her culture and her religion. She 
has a podcast — which is where the 
anonymous, online romance comes 
in — and she uses her platform to talk 
about herself and her life in a very 
unfiltered way. Similarly, she works 
to create a radio show that depicts 
people like her truthfully, without 
mindlessly subscribing to stereotypes. 
There’s a love story in the book too, 
of course, and while I did thoroughly 
enjoy the halal romcom feel of it all, 
Hana’s strength as a Muslim woman 
facing 
microaggressions 
in 
the 

workplace, working to understand her 

background and ultimately finding her 
voice mattered more to me than the 
admittedly very sweet romance. (I’m 
sorry, Aydin.)

I actually saw myself in Hana. 

Sure, she’s Indian-Canadian, and I’m 
Pakistani-American. She’s a hijabi, 
and I’m not. The details don’t matter. 
Her cultural and familial traditions 
are the same as mine. She has the 
same respect for her religion that I do. 
Her perspective on identity mirrors 
mine. Not to mention she’s a Swiftie, 
and so am I — and so is author Uzma 
Jalaluddin. 

In an interview with The Michigan 

Daily, 
Jalaluddin 
explained 
that 

she wanted to write for people like 
herself. Muslim girls deserve to see 
themselves in books too. Just because 
we don’t date in the traditional sense or 
because our attire is more modest than 
others doesn’t mean that we should 
be excluded from the romcom genre 
altogether. And just because we have a 
different perspective on life, a different 
identity, doesn’t mean that we don’t 
want to be understood.

“I didn’t grow up with that (kind 

of representation),” Jalaluddin said. 
There were hardly any books about 
South Asians, when she was growing 
up in Toronto, and even fewer about 
Muslims. “The ones that were there 
were rife with really toxic stereotypes; 
most of the time they were written 
by white authors … peering into the 
experience of what it’s like to be a non-
white person. I would read … them and 
get really angry.”

And she’s right. There exists 

this need to try to push all Muslim 
characters into this box of “bad” or 
“evil.” Even some of the stories that I 
love most do this. The film “Iron Man” 
comes to mind, where vaguely Muslim 
characters are the bad guys, torturing 
and tormenting the hero. And if the 
characters aren’t evil, they’re not 
represented as being “really Muslim,” 
like when those aforementioned hijabis 
decide to pursue relationships that 
aren’t exactly halal.

“What happens with this sort of 

‘girls gone wild, let me whip off my 
hijab when the first white boy smiles 
at me’ type of narrative, what you’re 
seeing is what other people think about 
Muslim women versus what happens 
when you write about an experience 
that is your own,” Jalaluddin said. “I 
don’t think about my hijab; I just wear 
it. I’ve worn it for years. It’s part of my 
identity.” 

That’s why her books, both “Ayesha 

at Last” and “Hana Khan”, have 
meant so much to me, why they’ve 
made me feel seen. She’s a member 
of the community that she’s writing 
about. She’s writing about people like 
her, people like me. She represents us 
truthfully. 

“I think I just really wanted to 

write a funny, entertaining book about 
Muslims, because it always pissed 
me off that we got the sad stories, the 
victim stories, the arranged marriage, 
forced marriage, extremists running 
off to do violence somewhere else 
stories … Those aren’t the books I like 
to read. I love romance. I want to read 
romance books.”

“I’m leaving the country because I have no 

friends.”

This is the opening line to one of my favorite 

books, “Again, But Better” by Christine Riccio. 
The second I read that line, I knew that this story 
was going to change my life (as cheesy as that may 
sound). I first read it shortly after graduating high 
school. Riccio has a big following on YouTube 
and documented her writing process in video 
diaries. One of my best friends was a huge fan, 
and when the book finally came out, she would 
not stop talking about it. She even drove down 
to Chicago to meet Riccio and have her sign her 
copy of the book. This same friend was gracious 
enough to let me borrow such a prized possession, 
and immediately after finishing it, I drove to three 
different Target locations to get my own copy.

“Again, But Better” follows Shane, a 

20-something student who impulsively signs 
up for a study abroad program in London after 
realizing that she has “done college all wrong.” 
The move is completely out of her comfort zone, 
but she meets new friends (and a very attractive 
housemate), travels all around Europe and gets 
a fancy internship. The only problem is, the 
semester is part of a creative writing program, and 
Shane’s parents want her to go into the medical 
field instead. Throw in a bit of magic and Taylor 
Swift references, and you have my ideal story (and 
my entire personality) summed up in less than 
400 pages. 

Since I bought my own copy, I’ve reread the 

book several times. While some of the smaller 
details have gradually become cheesier as I’ve 
grown older, the overall story has been a source 
of personal comfort. The romance has me 
grinning like an idiot every time, and the travel 
scenes reminded me of my own trip to Paris after 
graduation — if I ever study abroad, it will be solely 
because of this book. My most recent reread was 
this past May, and this time around something 
just clicked. 

I see myself in Shane in many different ways. 

For one, we share similar interests and dreams. 
We are also both naturally anxious people. Up 
until the start of the novel, Shane spent all her 
time reading alone in her dorm room and went 
home for the weekend every chance she got; 
I have to admit my freshman year experience 
was a little too similar. But just like Shane took 
matters into her own hands and traveled abroad, 
I transferred colleges. This year, I enrolled at the 
University of Michigan, the place I wanted to be 
all along. After a year of physical isolation — and 
two years of feeling left behind for not having the 
typical “college experience” — I began to feel like I 
was doing something right.

I was also finally honest with myself about 

wanting to be an author. It’s no known secret 
that careers in the arts make it hard to support 
yourself financially. Despite how much I loved to 
write, the idea of subjecting myself to such a high, 
constant level of stress scared me more. But no 
other potential career excites me nearly as much. 

Shane’s love for writing was a source of family 

conflict in “Again But Better.” Her parents 
disapproved of the idea, for many of the same 
reasons that I couldn’t fully commit to it. My 

parents have always been supportive of me in any 
path I would choose to take, so I didn’t have to 
resort to fabricating an entire pre-med program 
in order to go to London for a semester. Instead, 
the source of conflict lies within myself. But once 
I was able to admit out loud that I was at least 
willing to give it a try, it was suddenly worth it. 
Since starting at the University, I’ve switched 
my major and joined The Daily, where I am 
surrounded by people who love to write as much 
as I do.

If anyone reading this article relates to feeling 

lost and afraid like I was, I have two pieces of 
advice that I hope do not come off as too cliché. The 
first is to go after your passion. It may be difficult 
at first, but it has the potential to pay off in the long 
run — either in success, or in the experiences and 
friends you gain along the way. You won’t know 
unless you try. The second, of course, is to read 
this book (though I would recommend it in any 
circumstance).

Riccio captures everything I felt in her author’s 

note, before the book even begins: “I so badly 
wanted to read a coming-of-age story about 
someone who was 20 — someone who was still 
finding themselves and struggling with becoming 
an adult even after they hit the double-decade 
mark. I needed to know there was at least one 
other 20-plus person out there feeling as alone 
and lost as I was. This is for all the teens/young 
adults/adults who feel like they’ve been left 
behind. You’re not behind. You have time to find 
yourself and love and adventure. It’s all out there, 
and when you’re ready to push yourself out of your 
comfort zone and look for it, you’ll find it.” 

I think I’m finally finding it.

Oh, to be an octopus, slowly slithering 

my way through the dark, only to 
stumble on vestigial remains of an 
ancestor’s home. Aki Inomata’s moving-
image piece “Think Evolution #1: Kiku-
ishi (Ammonite)” describes what a good 
piece of art feels like: stumbling on a 
piece of home that you separated from 
lifetimes ago. Inomata was inspired by 
the instinct that octopuses had to huddle 
inside shell-like objects despite having 
evolved out of their shells millions of 
years ago. Thus, she decided to create a 
resin model based on the shells found of 
distant ancestors — ammonites. And so, 
in the moving image, the octopus slowly 
feels around the new shell it has fallen 
into — something it wasn’t necessarily 
looking for, but that seems to understand 
the octopus and its constitution. 

Some people would argue that is the 

point of consuming art: to see forms of 
humanity that vaguely mirror our own. 
We love finding our shells and holding 
them close. But sometimes, the shells 
don’t want us inside. I read books, a 
decent amount of them old. I can see 
myself in the good ones. But for a while, 
I didn’t read stories that wanted to see 
anyone who wasn’t white. I grew up 
reading “classics” like “Little House 
on the Prairie” and “Tintin” — looking 
back, it’s pretty easy to find racist 
undertones in these works. Consuming 
and internalizing these classics as a child 
is not an uncommon experience. To 
convince me that only these works are 
the “classics” or the pinnacle of literature 
is to do a disservice both to myself 
and those around me. To believe that 
only certain white artists are capable 
of highbrow expression and that only 
certain white characters are allowed to 
have humanity ultimately perpetuates 
white supremacy, and while these beliefs 
are easy to deny at face value, they are 
often still held subconsciously. 

As I’ve grown, I’ve stopped expecting 

authors to capture the world that I see. 
With all of the different experiences in 
the world, how could someone possibly 
articulate in print the out-of-place 
feelings that I find hard to admit to 
myself? At the beginning of 2019, I picked 
up a book from my school library with a 
gorgeously golden cover, and a West Side 
Story lyric in the title — “A Place for Us”, 
by Fatima Farheen Mirza. In the book, 
an Indian-American Muslim family’s 
past unravels as Amar, the youngest 
sibling, comes back to California for 
his eldest sister’s wedding. I think I’ll 
always be chasing the feeling I got from 
reading that book, from seeing Amar’s 
devastating choices and the family’s 
quiet love for each other (there’s a good 
chance my tear stains are still visible on 
the copy’s last chapter). Until that point, 
I had never seen a dynamic, intimate 
portrait of a family that felt like it was 
pulled from real life — from my life. 
Since, I have made it a point to seek out 
Asian American literature. 

It’s not difficult to find people 

who roll their eyes at the mention 
of 
representation. 
Due 
to 
the 

commodification of identity politics, 
widespread representation often focuses 

on the visibility of a few specific traits. 
They’re often used as tokens to make 
art “appealing” to as many people as 
possible, 
rather 
than 
representing 

members of these communities as 
complex human beings that exist 
within the intersections of their identity 
but are not solely defined by them. 
Representation 
is 
often 
dismissed 

as an agenda that is permeating the 
culture — altering the sanctity of what 
art “was” (which, by the way, is an 
incorrectly singular perception of the 
artistic zeitgeist of the “good old days”). 
This aforementioned viewpoint lacks 
empathy. “Forced” representation, while 
frustrating, is an important stepping 
stone. And honestly, there is victory in 
just seeing someone who looks like you 
exist and be considered as worthy of a 
story. Maybe the novelty might wear off, 
but for now, I am happy when I see South 
Asian people being their truest, complex 
selves in art.

What does good representation 

entail? This is a difficult question to 
answer. If I knew exactly what I wanted 
out of art, then maybe I would react 
to art differently. But connecting with 
people who have lived through relatable 
experiences is a reason why we love 
art. Now I know what that octopus 
felt, swiping around in the dark, when 
it landed on a home — something that 
seemed to know the octopus better 
than it knew itself, something that is a 
testament to something big. A collective 
experience intertwined with evolution 
and history and being alive on this planet.

I know that feeling when I read “A 

Tale for the Time Being” by Ruth Ozeki, 
a hilarious writer who has changed 
the way I think about what a life is and 
what a novel should be. I snuggle up in 
bed with Tahereh Mafi’s “A Very Large 
Expanse of Sea” and “Counting Down 
With You,” by Tashie Bhuiyan when 
I’m down, because they are beautiful, 
comforting stories that understand 
what it feels like to be a second-
generation teenager, to be othered in 
a sea of whiteness. And when I read 
Charles Yu’s “Interior Chinatown” 
in a day — I don’t think I’ll ever read 
a more genius marriage of form and 
function, or a portrait of what it means 
to live with stereotypes. And this 
summer, when I went into the Strand 
Bookstore before meeting a friend; after 
wandering around, I picked up “Good 
Talk” by Mira Jacob. Before I knew it, 
the quietly hilarious 349-page graphic 
memoir was done, my feet were hurting, 
and I had a few missed calls from my 
friend, who eventually decided to 
wander around the bookstore and read 
a few titles herself. And “Gold Diggers,” 
don’t get me started on “Gold Diggers” 
by Sanjena Sathian — it’s everything I’ve 
never known I wanted out of a book.

Cathy Park Hong’s work changed 

the way I think about myself. Upasna 
Barath’s podcast and writing for 
Rookie speak to me like no one else 
can. Ocean Vuong’s poetry. Aimee 
Nezhukumatathil’s “World of Wonders.” 
Arthur Sze’s “Residence on Earth.” 
Jillian and Mariko Tamaki’s “This One 
Summer.” Fatimah Asghar’s “My Love 
for Nature.” There are too many to name, 
these artists who have made me. Me and 
my shells.

Finding ammonites

When Taylor Swift announced that she would be 

releasing a 10-minute version of her 2012 breakup 
ballad “All Too Well” on her re-recorded album 
Red (Taylor’s Version), fans everywhere erupted 
into excitement. The original cut, already over five 
minutes long, was never released as a single, despite 
being one of Swift’s favorite songs off Red. Once the 
album was released in 2012, however, fans quickly 
gravitated to the song on their own and have been 
obsessed with its tragic story of a head-over-heels 
romance gone wrong. On a Thursday night, curled 
up in bed waiting for her new album to drop, I was 
in shambles when midnight arrived, immersing 
myself in an extended version of one of Swift’s most 
beloved songs. 

“All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s 

Version) (From the Vault),” has only been out for a 
couple of weeks, but is already smashing records. 
Overtaking Don McLean’s “American Pie” as the 
longest song to top Billboard’s Hot 100, the song 
provides more context to the original recording, 
supposedly recounting the break-up between 
Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal.

In the days following the release of Red (Taylor’s 

Version), I obsessively expressed my love for the 
10-minute version of “All Too Well” to just about 
every person I know. While raving about the song 
to a friend, he asked me, “What makes this song so 
great?” Like many Swifties who also love the song, 
my immediate answer was, “it’s relatable,” but that 
wasn’t enough to convince him. What’s relatable 
about a breakup between two celebrities? Why are 
people obsessing over a song that’s far too long?

Perhaps the 10-minute version of “All Too Well” 

dropped right when I needed it most, which makes 
it all the more impactful. As a newly-single college 
student, the song hits close to home when I think 
about my own failed relationships. Throughout 

the song Swift dives into the gritty details of her 
failing relationship, weaponizing specific details 
in the face of gaslighting. In one of the song’s newly 
released verses, Swift describes a scene in which 
her then-boyfriend makes claims to feminism as he 
makes her drive his car: “You were tossing me the 
car keys / ‘Fuck the patriarchy’ / Keychain on the 
ground / We were always skipping town.” In these 
lines, Swift paints a heartbreaking picture of an 
arrogant boyfriend tossing the car keys to his naïve 
girlfriend, not even bothering to hand them to her 
as he makes his way to the passenger seat. 

Although some may consider this a small 

inconvenience, this scene alone confronts a subtle 
evil many women face in relationships. For me, 
this verse reminded me of all the times guys have 
imposed negligence in the name of feminism 
— whether that be making me take a cab in an 
unfamiliar city when they could’ve picked me 
up from the airport or pushing the check across 
the table for me to pay, claiming that it’s because 
they believe in “gender equality.” By addressing 
these subtle moments that often go unnoticed, 
Swift is validating the disappointment and anger 
so many women feel when they’re forced into 
uncomfortable situations under the false pretext of 
feminism. 

At the bridge’s close, Swift, despite being 

surrounded by friends and family for her 
21st birthday, describes the loneliness and 
disappointment she felt while waiting for her 
significant other to arrive. Swift perfectly depicts 
the bitter irony of spending what should be one 
of life’s most exciting milestones mourning the 
absence of a careless boyfriend, but what I find 
even more heartbreaking about the scene is the 
way Swift recalls how her father “watched me 
watch the front door all night, willin’ you to come 
/ And he said, ‘It’s supposed to be fun turning 21.’” 
Last year I spent my 21st birthday in the wake of a 
breakup and a global pandemic, so Swift’s retelling 
of her own tragic 21st celebration felt particularly 

personal. Young love is notorious for being an all-
consuming experience, and I too can relate to the 
overwhelming feeling of falling in love and allowing 
my emotions toward a single person to overpower 
my own sense of self and better judgment. 

The lesson here, which many 20-somethings 

have come to understand, is that it’s difficult for the 
people who love us — parents, siblings, friends — to 
watch us drown in our emotions, especially when 
they know that we’d be much better off without the 
person causing us harm. Here, Swift acknowledges 
that sometimes the people in our lives know us 
better than we know ourselves. This bridge took me 
right back to the time when my mom confronted 
me about the way my then-boyfriend was talking 
down to me, or the summer before my junior year 
of college when I cried to my parents, admitting 
that my relationship was falling apart and I needed 
to end things, to which my parents glanced at each 
other and sympathetically nodded their heads as if 
to say, “We’ve known this for months now.” 

Some fans believe that the final two minutes 

of the song, where Swift repeats the line, “It was 
rare / I was there,” is a way for her to legitimize 
the gaslighting she’s experienced — in a world 
that’s so quick to tell women that they’re being 
dramatic, remembering the gritty details is 
often the only way to affirm that the pains we’ve 
experienced actually happened. Swift claims a 
significant amount of time and space to retell her 
experiences in “All Too Well,” which is a bold feat; 
most female songwriters are only allowed two or 
three minutes to unpack the emotional baggage of 
a painful breakup. 

While Swift bravely confronts the small ways 

women have been slighted by their male partners, 
the song is more of a retrospective narrative 
than a pointed assertion pinning men as the sole 
perpetrators of unsuccessful relationships. I don’t 
think Swift’s intention was to blame men. 

Negligence in the name of feminism, I know it ‘All Too Well’

On April 20, 2021, the Detroit Free 

Press broke the news that CEO of 
Activision Blizzard — one of America’s 
premier AAA game companies, 
publisher of juggernaut franchises 
like “Call of Duty” and “World of 
Warcraft” — Bobby Kotick gifted $4 
million to the University of Michigan 
to establish an esports minor. Kotick, 
who studied Art History at the 
University, dropped out in the ’80s, 
supposedly based on the advice of 
Steve Jobs.

According to the Free Press, the 

minor was created in an effort to “help 
students get ready for a career in the 
esports industry.” The courses funded 
by Kotick are being jointly developed 
by the Schools of Kinesiology, 
Engineering and Information, with 
the first offerings expected by 2022. 

However, on July 20, 2021, 

Bloomberg 
announced 
that 
the 

California 
Department 
of 
Fair 

Employment and Housing was suing 
Activision Blizzard. 

A two-year investigation found that 

the company had rampant workplace 
discrimination 
against 
female 

employees and consistently failed 
to combat discrimination, address 
harassment or prevent retaliation. 
Company president J. Allen Brack was 
named in the suit; Brack subsequently 
stepped down at the beginning of 
August to be replaced by Jen Oneal 
and Mike Ybarra. After only three 
months in the role, Oneal resigned at 
the beginning of November, leaving 
Activision Blizzard to “create better 
support, resources, and guidance to 
women in the gaming industry.” 

The culture of the company 

was likened to a frat; a male-
focused 
culture 
of 
excessive 

drinking, 
harassment 
toward 

female employees and crude jokes 
permeated the workplace. This 
culture allegedly degraded female 
employees, as the men cited concerns 
about workplace efficiency due to 
prospects of pregnancy and familial 
obligations. Female workers also 
noted being constantly delegated 
work before being hit on by fellow 
male workers and supervisors, who 
would make vulgar jokes about rape 
and talk about desired sexual actions. 
The lawsuit mentions one worker 
taking her own life after her private, 

sexually explicit pictures circulated 
around the company without her 
consent. Some men stepped forward 
as victims as well.

Although Activision Blizzard is not 

new to scandals (2019’s Blitzchung 
controversy being a prime example), 
the lawsuit broke a dam, causing 
massive 
walkouts 
and 
complex 

debates within fan communities. 
People questioned their comfort 
playing games developed or published 
by Activision Blizzard and how to 
best support the developers while 
denouncing the company itself. Lines 
were drawn, both in real life and on 
Twitter. If you bought the upcoming 
“Diablo II: Resurrected” or “Call of 
Duty: Vanguard” or even continued to 
play “World of Warcraft,” you weren’t 
an ally. Matters were made worse 
when a second lawsuit was filed, 
this time by investors who claimed 
the company purposefully failed 
to disclose its ongoing problems in 
regards to the sexual harassment and 
discrimination, leading to artificially 
inflated stock. The investors argue 
that if they had been aware of the 
internal issues, they would not have 
invested. Kotick was personally 
named in the lawsuit as someone who 
was “instrumental in the spreading of 
false information.” 

The initial lawsuit was then 

expanded, the state of California 
adding temporary workers under the 
suit’s purview and stating Activision 
Blizzard has obfuscated investigations 
through NDAs. Around the same 
time, the company was also accused 
of shredding evidence. The Securities 
and Exchange Commission started 
their own investigation in September, 
subpoenaing Kotick along with other 
senior executives. Things continued 
to get worse.

According to a recent report 

published on Nov. 16 from the Wall 
Street Journal, Kotick was aware of 
the sexual misconduct allegations for 
years. He purportedly hid information 
about incidents from board members, 
and personally had accusations of 
general misconduct that had been 
settled out of court. One terrifying 
account of Kotick’s behavior states 
that “In 2006, one of his assistants 
complained that he had harassed 
her, including by threatening in a 
voicemail to have her killed, according 
to people familiar with the matter.”

“I’m writing a piece about Superwholock.”
My roommate’s eyes fill with maternal 

disappointment after I tell her my weekend 
plans. “That is,” she struggles for the words, 
“that is the last thing I wanted to hear.” I see a 
glint of hope in her eye — hope that I’m joking, 
that this all a nightmare, but I only nod with a 
feeble attempt to fight back a smile.

“Maddie.”
My roommate is desperate now, pleading, 

but not even she cannot stop the oncoming 
storm. My hubris is immeasurable and my 
work indispensable — I must memorialize 
Superwholock. Even if I must burn bridges in 
the process. 

I’ll concede, my roommate and I were only 

ten years old when Superwholock invaded 
Tumblr in 2011, but we’ve both been haunted 
by it for the last ten years. Superwholock, 
for those who are blissfully unaware of this 
pop culture phenomenon, is the name of 
the fictional alternate universe in which the 
characters and plots of the television shows 
“Supernatural,” “Doctor Who” and “Sher-
lock” inhabit the same universe. If you had 
really never heard of this before I fed you from 
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, 
your follow-up question might be, “How did 
this happen?”

 “Sherlock” and “Doctor Who” shared pro-

duction teams under the BBC and had similar 
mainstream appeal in the U.K. The crossing 
over truly began in the U.S. as “‘Doctor Who’ 
and ‘Supernatural’ fans filled similar roles — 
as small but enthusiastic fan bases made up of 
young people with an interest in science fiction 
and fantasy.” The “Doctor Who” reboot began 
the same year that “Supernatural” premiered 
— 2005 — but these fandoms didn’t experience 
much interaction in the States, so “Sherlock” 
had to act as the proverbial bridge between 
the two. “Sherlock” was already inherently 
tied to “Doctor Who,” but the show’s ability to 
employ a fantastical grittiness was what drew 
“Supernatural” fans into the triad. 

These common threads helped all three 

shows enjoy simultaneous and meteoric rises 
to pop culture stardom in the early 2010s. Each 
show spawned avid fandoms that eventually 
joined together to create a conglomerate fan-
dom, dubbing themselves as “Superwholock-

ians.” The Superwholock universe is wide and 
complex; the main characters from all three 
shows coexist and go on any number of adven-
tures together — sometimes Sherlock and the 
Doctor are lovers, and other times “Sherlock 
and the Doctor occasionally switch trench-
coats and imitate each other just to mess with 
Sam and Dean.” It’s difficult to trace the exact 
origins of Superwholock, as some believe it 
first appeared in January of 2012 while other 
sources claim the trend started as early as 
2010. But, it is generally believed that Super-
wholock originated in 2011 since the first-ever, 
now deleted, post under the Superwholock tag 
on Tumblr dates back to August of 2011. 

For the next three years, Superwholock 

continued to explode in popularity, and this 
rampant proliferation of the fandom was due 
to a number of elements. In the “Doctor Who” 
universe, fan-favorite David Tennant had 
bowed out of the role of the Doctor in 2009 
and was replaced by new fan-favorite Matt 
Smith in 2010. The BBC’s “Sherlock” had fin-
ished its first season in the winter of 2010 and 
was between seasons, and “Supernatural” had 
wrapped up its sixth season only a few months 
prior and was still coming down from its Apoc-
alypse storyline. Tumblr had “emerged as one 
of the fastest-growing consumer-oriented 
Internet sites … with its audience surging from 
4.2 million visitors in July 2010 to 13.4 million 
visitors in July 2011,” while popular fanfic-
tion website Wattpad reached a milestone of 
1,000,000 users in the same year. Fans were 
left with their three favorite shows in states 
of limbo and newly popularized social media 
sites made for creating and sharing original 
content, so it’s no wonder that Superwholock 
exploded onto the digital scene in 2011. 

The peak of Superwholock’s popular-

ity lasted for approximately four years, but 
its aftershocks are still felt a decade later in 
the way my roommate groans when I say the 
phrase within ten feet of her. “It was the most 
ambitious crossover event in history,” she 
relented after I convinced her that this article 
was a good idea. “It was a cultural reset.” She’s 
right — it’s difficult to emphasize the impact 
Superwholock had on online fandoms, and 
its ability to exist solely on the internet was 
what made it so unique. All three fan groups 
involved had survived offline; “Doctor Who” 
premiered 30 years before the internet was 
made available to the public, so the crossover 
was exclusive to the web and, more specifical-

ly, Tumblr. For one of the most popular social 
media sites of my time, Tumblr is as disor-
ganized as they come — it is built to largely 
promote single paragraph blog posts, small 
collections of images, stream-of-conscious-
ness content and does not allow for blogs to 
combine into larger groups. I opened my now-
defunct Tumblr account to test just how dis-
orderly my dashboard could possibly be and, I 
was right. I could feel a headache forming after 
approximately two minutes of scrolling. 

With this in mind, it seems to me that the 

miracle of Superwholock is that it was ever 
organized in the first place. The mega-fandom 
was based almost entirely in online interaction 
on one of the messiest social media platforms 
we use, and yet it formed and grew at a daz-
zling pace. Suddenly, you couldn’t spend more 
than a few minutes on Tumblr without being 
bombarded by “Supernatural” GIFs or seeing 
absolutely outlandish usernames like tardis-
in-the-impala-at-221B. Currently, on Watt-
pad, searching Superwholock yields 43,700 
results. 43,700 fanfictions, one shots and AUs 
written over the last decade dedicated to one 
mega-fandom. Superwholock even marked 
the advent of similar conglomerate fandoms 
like Rise of the Brave Tangled Dragons or Bee 
Shrek Test in the House.

If Superwholock proved nothing beyond its 

sheer size and power, it proved that fandoms, 
whether mega or micro, could organize and 
move in less than ideal circumstances, and 
all online. Superwholock was one of the first 
fan-made and controlled crossovers of its size, 
and it did it without traditional media, fur-
ther evidencing that these groups could and 
would learn how to exist online if measly bar-
riers, like the cannon of the individual shows 
involved, stood in the way. With internet fan-
dom culture still fresh in the early 2010s, this 
completely changed how fandoms operated 
because, once fan groups learned to organize 
and manipulate social media to their will, 
there was nothing they couldn’t do and noth-
ing they needed permission for. Fans con-
nected across borders of any kind to bond over 
this behemoth that they created and nurtured. 
Superwholock meant so much to its fans 
because it was a fandom of their own creation, 
and they broke molds by showing the world 
how they could create trends, memes and art 
all their own, without ever meeting or engag-
ing in more traditional forms of fandom. 

Strangely, it was in-person interaction that 

seemingly killed Superwholock in 2014. Dash-
Con, a fan convention organized by Tumblr 
users and aimed largely at fandoms like Super-
wholock, occurred in the summer of 2014. 
Plagued by shady funding, poor organizing 
and mistreatment of panel guests, DashCon 
was Tumblr’s Fyre Festival. After the con-
vention’s failure, Superwholock utterly dis-
appeared, perhaps from the embarrassment 
Tumblr fandom culture sustained in the after-
math of DashCon. When assembled in real life, 
Superwholock crumbled and cemented that 
the organization of its fans, like other fandom 
crossovers after it, could only be sustained 
online where it was born and raised. And it 
was sustained.

When I recently checked the Super-

wholock tag on Tumblr, I spent about 20 
minutes scrolling through posts and still only 
made it to March of this year. Superwholock 
has carried on for a decade despite its failures, 
and I see no evidence of the original mega-fan-
dom truly dying any time soon. 

Superwholock was, for lack of a better 

word, a god of its time, and in calling it as such, 
I also admit that I feel like a minor prophet 
writing this article — a mortal hearing the 
word of the divine and putting it down for the 
masses to receive. This feels like a call back to 
a time when I was most deeply entrenched in 
the Superwholock fandom, but I could never 
look back on that period of my life with a spirit 
of animosity. Rather I see myself, aged 13 or 14, 
sitting in front of a school-administered iPad 
happily devouring any fanfiction or GIF sets 
that interlocked my three favorite universes. 

I respect this as a time of real growth for me. 
Superwholock gave me and thousands of oth-
ers a chance to grow into an admittedly very 
nerdy side of ourselves that would not have 
been fostered as safely in any environment 
other than online fan communities — because 
if you think I didn’t refer to myself as a “high 
functioning sociopath” and didn’t get bullied 
for it at least once in middle school, then I am 
here to tell you that you are dead wrong. Ulti-
mately, though, I often feel a deep-rooted nos-
talgia for those years that cannot be replicated. 

The fact that today, as a junior in college, I 

can make Superwholock jokes with my room-
mate and even pitch this article should prove 
the longevity of Superwholock not only in my 
life but in the life of the internet as well. Super-
wholock’s popularity may have peaked long 
ago, but we all know nothing can ever really 
be deleted online; it is still worth praising 
how the fandom has persisted all these years. 
The shows at the foundation of this trend 
have weathered immense changes — “Super-
natural” has ended, “Doctor Who” has cycled 
through two more Doctors and “Sherlock” 
has not released any new content since 2017. 
The fandom has changed too, as its members 
age and enter new phases of life, but that is to 
be expected when they created this universe 
a decade ago. The sheer gravity of a decade, 
ten years, is in itself an ode to the passion of 
fandoms that really love what they create. 
Superwholock was a god. Today it is a house 
of memories built with love and care, its doors 
open to generations to come for several more 
decades.

The boobs : balls ratio

There are several tests to quantify how well 

a narrative treats characters who are women. 
The most famous is probably the Bechdel test 
for women’s representation — two women must 
have a conversation about a topic other than 
a man in the film for it to pass. When Alison 
Bechdel first created the test in 1985, most films 
were not able to pass, but, in recent years, over 
50% do. 

Obviously, the Bechdel test only scratches 

the surface when it comes to a woman’s role in 
a story. Other tests have since been created. The 
sexy lamp test, for example, tries to determine 
how important a woman is in the story — if 
you can replace her character with a sexy lamp 
without the story falling apart, then it isn’t good 
representation. 

These tests are flawed in many ways, but 

they are designed to get us thinking about what 
we’re seeing on screen when it comes to repre-
sentation. In high school, as I started to watch 
more TV from around the world, I started to 
think about the discrepancies between the 
ways women and men are portrayed onscreen, 
especially when it comes to nudity. 

Seeing naked women on screen is fairly stan-

dard in film and television, but male nudity isn’t 
as common. One 2018 analysis of over 1,000 
popular films found that around 25% of women 
in these films had nude scenes, compared to 9% 
of men. I started noticing this disparity after 
watching the first season of “Babylon Berlin,” 
which featured the first televised male nude 
scene that I had ever seen. Male bodies were 
presented in sex scenes and in nonsexual set-
tings, like skinny dipping and nude body search-
es. It made me realize that the only bodies I had 
ever seen naked onscreen were of cis women, 
whose bodies are almost always displayed gra-
tuitously.

After finishing “Babylon Berlin,” I started to 

become aware of the boobs-to-balls ratio in the 
shows and movies that I watched. My experi-
ence as a viewer aligns with the analysis’s find-
ings: Most media that features nudity skews 
towards showing naked women. Few shows 
have one-to-one ratios and none that I’ve seen 
solely show men naked. 

One reason for this might be because of who 

is behind the camera. Women are subjected to 
being viewed through a patriarchal lens that 
focuses extensively on how attractive they are 
to heterosexual men, a phenomenon known as 
the male gaze. Their characters don’t inherently 
need to be nude to be interesting, well-rounded 
people, but society’s obsession with women’s 
sexuality devalues them if they are not catering 
to a patriarchal sex fantasy. 

A recent analysis by the Geena Davis Insti-

tute on Gender and Media found that women 
movie leads were four times more likely to be 
shown naked than their male counterparts. 
Powerful women in film and television are 
often characterized by their naked bodies in 
ways that men are not. And the sexy, powerful 
woman trope can be seen everywhere — from 
TV to video games and even to the way women 
leaders in history, like Cleopatra, are seen as sex 
symbols. 

Topless women are featured in a few of Netf-

lix’s episodes of “The Witcher,” and lead actress 
Anya Chalhotra, who plays Yennefer, appears 
naked twice. Her nakedness is tied to her access 
to power — she undresses in these scenes to 
perform rituals that would make her a more 
powerful sorceress; there is also a disturbing 
and misogynistic undertone to these scenes. It 
seems that a woman’s power is directly tied to 
her body and her sex appeal. 

Henry Cavill, the male lead who plays the 

titular character, does not appear naked in the 
same capacity that Chalhotra does. Cavill is 
shown naked in a bathtub, but only his torso 
is visible. It makes sense that he doesn’t wear 
clothes while bathing, but Chalhotra doesn’t 
necessarily need to be shown naked to perform 
a spell and establish that she is powerful.

The expectation for women to appear nude 

onscreen can also have detrimental effects on 
actors. Emilia Clarke, who played Daenerys on 
“Game of Thrones,” revealed that the early nude 
scenes “terrified” her. As a new actress, she did 
not have the knowledge or power to argue with 
showrunners who asked her to appear com-
pletely naked in front of the cast and crew. In 
later seasons, when Clarke refused to be naked 
on screen, showrunners guilted her for disap-
pointing “Game of Thrones” fans, as if they 
were only watching her for her naked body — a 
dismissive view of both Clarke’s boundaries and 
her performance.

Strikingly, there are few depictions of full-

frontal male nudity on “Game of Thrones,” com-
pared to the many instances of women’s nudity. 
When male nudity is presented, it is rarely pre-
sented sexually. Instead, they are presented in 
regular contexts, such as pulling out a penis to 
pee. 

Thankfully, in the years since Clarke’s first 

nude scene in “Game of Thrones,” there have 
been movements in the film and television 
industry to change the exploitative nature of 
intimate scenes. Many shows now hire intima-
cy coordinators, who work to make sex scenes 
more comfortable for actors while making sure 
that everything occurring on screen is con-
sented to by everyone involved. The necessity to 
hire intimacy coordinators is especially evident 
after the #MeToo movement, but it can’t repair 
the implicit attitudes of sexualization that exist 
in the media’s presentation of women’s bodies. 

Even movies that center around sex shy 

away from depicting full-frontal male nudity. 
“Fifty Shades of Grey” has plenty of nude scenes 
of Dakota Johnson, who plays the female lead, 
but does not have a single comparable shot of 

Jamie Dornan’s penis. It’s strange that a movie 
targeted towards heterosexual women chooses 
to solely display the heroine naked. Similarly, 
“Call Me By Your Name,” another popular film 
with plenty of sex scenes, doesn’t feature any 
male full-frontal but does curiously include 
boob shots — a confounding decision in a movie 
about gay men’s intimacy. 

Women’s bodies are often shown in both 

sexual and casual settings, like when they’re 
lounging at home, but when men are put in 
similar positions, the camera shies away. Film-
makers are only comfortable placing women 
in these vulnerable positions. Women are typi-
cally represented as more delicate and therefore 
more defenseless than men, and nudity may 
be a literal way to characterize femininity. It is 
unfortunate, though, that femininity is defined 
by men in film through a naked and conven-
tionally attractive cis-gendered body as if that 
is all women have to offer to the screen. There 
is an inherent sense of dehumanization because 
women’s bodies are represented as the most 
important part of their being. 

Recently, there have been efforts to close the 

gap and make the boobs-to-balls ratio more 
even. HBO’s “Euphoria” shows 71 penises in 
its eight episodes, with one scene alone having 
almost 30. Although there are still scenes of 
naked women on the show, the sheer amount of 
male nudity is shocking because viewers aren’t 
accustomed to seeing it. In “Euphoria,” male 
nudity is presented in a way that’s similar to the 
historical ways naked women are shown on 
screen. While the nude reversal of gender that 
“Euphoria” employs is interesting, it does call 
into question how necessary these scenes are, 
especially given that the characters depicted in 
them are mostly minors. 

Movies are also selective in the type of bod-

ies that are shown on screen. The naked women 
we usually see on screen are conventionally 
attractive (skinny and white), as most of the 
women in the film industry are. Transgender 
characters are rarely seen in films from major 
studios. Bodies that exist outside of the gender 
binary also deserve to be well-represented but 
are unfortunately dismissed from most main-
stream media. 

Actors have also recognized the boobs-to-

balls disparity and have called on each other to 
close it. In 2015, Kevin Bacon noted the gender 
disparities of nudity and started #Freethe-
Bacon, wherein he encourages male actors to 
free “your weiner, your balls and your butt.” 
Mark Duplass, who appeared nude on HBO’s 
“Togetherness,” said that he believes in what he 
calls balls equality, and the need to show naked 
men on TV not as sex symbols but just as regular 
people. 

“If boobs or a vagina come out, a penis or a set 

of testicles should go along with it,” Duplass said 
in a 2016 interview. “It should be 50/50 in this 
country.”

While Duplass championing for balls equal-

ity is commendable in closing the gap, it won’t 
change the gratuitous and harmful always in 
which nude women are represented. It might 
be impossible to divorce the framing of these 
nude scenes from patriarchal gazes — “Fifty 
Shades of Grey,” the mainstream erotica that 
doesn’t have a single penis in it, was directed 
by a woman. Even a female director portrays 
women characters as objects of desire and sexu-
ality for men, further complicating ideas about 
representation. These issues of objectification 
are deeply entrenched in social norms and the 
film industry in general, and more conversa-
tions must be held for progress to be made. 

Nudity in film and television is a complicated 

topic that needs to be understood from multiple 
angles — from how gratuitous it is to how much 
power an actor has in the scene. And persisting 
media trends — who is shown naked, how much 
and when — often point towards objectification 
of women’s characters. Evening the ratio isn’t 
just about showing men naked, it’s about reduc-
ing the gratuitous depictions of nude women, 
too. 

Women, though, are more than just their 

bodies. When filmmakers decide to highlight 
only women in vulnerable or sexual positions, 
they reinforce gendered stereotypes of what 
women can be. And even if the boobs-to-balls 
ratio approaches a perfect one-to-one, we must 
still contend with how women are written and 
how much agency they have in the stories we’re 
watching.

The only piece of media that I have seen 

with a one-to-one boobs-to-balls ratio is the 
third season of Netflix’s “Castlevania,” which 
also features well-written women. In the show, 
nudity is presented sexually and non-sexually 
but fits well within the narrative. In one scene, 
a prisoner is shown naked and the camera 
shows his entire shivering body, including his 
genitals. And while seeing a flaccid penis in a 
cartoon is a little unsettling, it adds dimension 
to his condition and highlights how depress-
ing his imprisonment is. What “Castlevania” 
doesn’t include is gratuitous depictions of 
naked women. Boob shots only appear in sex 
scenes alongside bodies of naked men. 

What makes season three of “Castlevania” 

so compelling isn’t just its even ratio, it is also 
the depth of the women characters, includ-
ing lesbians and women of color, who all have 
distinct personalities and aren’t relegated to 
simply being sexy. There are plenty of shows 
with amazing women characters, including 
“The Witcher” and “Game of Thrones,” but the 
misogynistic ways in which these shows por-
tray women by hyper-focusing on their bodies 
prevent them from being truly great examples 
of representation. “Castlevania’s” director 
even refused to show one of the most powerful 
women in the show topless, moving away from 
the ever-present sexy powerful lady trope.

“Ujima,” meaning collective work and 

responsibility in Kiswahili, is a concept that 
defines the importance of unified action to 
create change. The term often materializes 
by way of strikes, sit-ins and other forms of 
protest. Integral to Black activism at the 
University of Michigan, Ujima has inspired 
visible change, including the formation 
of alliances between student groups, the 
establishment of an academic department 
for Black students and uplifting spaces for 
minority students on campus. To capture 
the practice and impact of the concept, the 
Department of Afroamerican and Afri-
can Studies‘ Program Manager Elizabeth 
James, LSA senior Solomon Lucy and U-M 
alums Kai Dotson and Justin Williams from 
the Black Student Union curated an exhibit 
using its name — “UJIMA: Collective activ-
ism at the University of Michigan.”

Located at the south end of Haven Hall, 

the exhibit includes descriptions, posters 
and photographs from as early as 1853 and 
as recent as 2017. It presents multiple cam-
paigns and activist groups that aimed to 
address discrimination against Black stu-
dents through community organization and 
coalition-building. 

Those unable to visit UJIMA in person 

can still engage with the exhibit by visiting 
the virtual gallery, which provides just as 
illuminating of an experience. Administra-
tive Coordinator at DAAS Arielle Chen, who 
managed the creation of the virtual gallery, 
noted that she and her colleagues aimed to 
make the gallery accessible to a wide array 
of people, including neurodivergent indi-
viduals and people with visual and audi-
tory impairments. When speaking about 
her motives behind creating the virtual 

gallery, Chen stated that “art tends to be for 
the elite,” but by making the exhibit public 
and accessible, students and other members 
of the Ann Arbor community could actu-
ally benefit from it. With access, viewers can 
learn about the several Black student-led 
movements that have shaped the University 
for the better.

Among these student-led movements 

was a sit-in following the assassination of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., held on the day 
of his burial, April 9, 1968. On the same day, 
members of the then-newly established BSU 
locked themselves inside the Administra-
tion Building and demanded an increase in 
funding and Black representation amongst 
faculty. The sit-in pressured the University 
to establish the Center for Afroamerican 
and African Studies — now called DAAS — 
which serves as an academic department 
devoted to Black studies. However, the num-
ber of Black faculty had barely increased by 
1970, sparking a wave of protests known as 
the first Black Action Movement. This time 
around, not only did the BSU play a critical 
role, but other Black student organizations 
— such as the Black Law Student Alliance, 
Black Medical Students, Association of 
Black Social Work Students, Black Psycholo-
gist Organization and Black Educational 
Caucus — did as well. And, in 1970, after 
administrators 
disregarded 
demonstra-

tions for months, then-University President 
Robben Fleming agreed to meet with the 
aforementioned groups. Collectively, the 
organizations issued a list of demands to the 
University:

1. 10% Black enrollment by fall 1973.
2. 900 new Black students by fall 1971 – 

450 freshmen, 150 transfers, 300 graduate 
students.

3. An adequate supportive services pro-

gram, including financial aid to finance 
Black students’ education.

4. Graduate and undergraduate recruit-

ers (9) to recruit Black students.

5. A referendum to the March Student 

Government Council ballot to have students 
vote on assessing themselves $3.00 for one 
year for the Martin Luther King Scholarship 
Fund.

6. Tuition waivers for minority group 

students who are also residents of the state 
of Michigan.

7. The establishment of a community-

located Black Student Center.

8. All work of a permanent nature on the 

Black studies program is to be halted until 
an effective input is fully developed by a 
community-university forum.

9. The creation of a university-wide 

appeal board to rule on the adequacy of 
financial aid grants to students.

10. A revamping of the Parent’s Confiden-

tial Statement.

11. There should be one recruit for Chica-

no students to ensure 50 Chicano students 
are admitted by fall 1970.

12. Black students are to be referred to as 

Black, not Negro or anything else.

More than half a century since the pro-

tests erupted, the University has not satis-
fied these demands. Despite the University’s 
inaction, BAM demonstrated the strength 
of collective action, successfully advocat-
ing for the establishment of the first minor-
ity institutions on campus. Black students 
demanded the establishment of a commu-
nity-located Black Student Center, which 
led to the foundation of the Trotter House 
and Ambatana Lounge — the first spaces 
dedicated to minority students on campus. 
Today, a newly-renovated Trotter Multicul-
tural Center exists in these buildings’ places 
after Black students campaigned for a more 
accessible institution in early 2014.

While in quarantine during the sum-

mer of 2020, I turned to binge-watching 
as my central form of escapism. Many 
mornings began with laying on my couch 
and watching at least a few hours of tele-
vision. I indulged in all of my favorite sit-
coms, from “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” 
to “Everybody Hates Chris.” The humor of 
these shows was a perfect distraction from 
the uncertain realities of a peak-pandemic 
world. 

My absolute favorite sitcom to watch is 

“Living Single,” which depicts the lives of 
six friends exploring their 20s in Brooklyn, 
N.Y. What I really love about this show is 
how multi-faceted each character is. While 
they’re all pursuing their own careers in the 
professional world, none of the characters 
fall into the “token Black character” trope 
as they still have their own faults and areas 
for growth and there are no central white 
characters in the show that their narratives 

revolve around, making them very fleshed-
out characters. For a 30-minute sitcom, each 
of the central characters had a fully round-
ed-out story arc and the show had plenty of 
drama, making it the perfect series to binge 
all through my summer. While watching 
these shows, I couldn’t help but wonder as to 
why current Black TV lacked the same sort 
of effortless authenticity as some of my favor-
ite shows from the late 90s and early 2000s. 
There seems to be a disconnect between 
older and more recent depictions of the 
Black American lifestyle; Many of the more 
recently produced Black TV shows, specifi-
cally ones created in the past several years, 
seem to be more directed towards white 
audiences.

In considering contemporary Black TV 

shows with questionable levels of authen-
ticity, shows like “BlackAF” or “Black-ish” 
come to mind. While I do enjoy shows like 
“Black-ish” to an extent, many of these 
shows seem to be greatly catered towards 
white audiences, as they take time to explain 
aspects of the Black American experience 
that would otherwise be implied in a show 

that was simply just for Black people in 
America. Most episodes of “Black-ish” begin 
with the main character and patriarch of the 
Johnson family, Andre Johnson (Anthony 
Anderson), explaining some aspect of the 
“typical” Black American lifestyle. The audi-
ence for these monologues is seemingly non-
Black, and more specifically white, viewers. 
This speaks to the larger commercial suc-
cess that is seen when Black narratives are 
watered down to be made palatable to white 
audiences. However, this comes at the cost 
of sacrificing more elaborate depictions of 
Blackness. Wider audiences outside of the 
Black community may not understand the 
implied facets of Black American lifestyle 
and its niche cultural references, so these 
typically have to be spelled out for the sake 
of more widespread comprehension. While 
these may seem like insignificant sacrifices 
to make, this ultimately diminishes a piece 
of the tasteful charm of Black TV and some-
what reduces the standards to which Black 
stories can be told on television.

With Mars moving into Sagit-

tarius and your seventh house of part-
nerships, now is a great time to socialize, 

which is one of your favorite activities 

anyway. The seventh house rules over all 
kinds of relationships, not just romantic 

ones. Even if you’re not searching for 
love, you can still gain a lot from a new 
platonic or work relationship, and you 
may develop a bond with someone you 

hadn’t expected to get along with.

When Mercury enters fiery 

Sagittarius and your eighth house 

of rebirth, your passions may become 
reignited. If you’ve been wanting to 
start a new project, now is a great 
time. Be realistic with your expecta-

tions; otherwise, you may be too 

discouraged to continue if 
your plans don’t blossom 

into fruition.

This week’s celestial 

events perfectly align to favor 
academic success for your sign 

with the end of the semester 
quickly approaching. Now is 
a great time to dedicate your 
relentless drive to your studies 

so you can learn all that 

you can.

With Mercury in Cap-

ricorn and your seventh house 
of partnerships, you may feel 
more willing to form new con-
nections, especially in regard 
to work relationships. Now is a 
great time to get to know your 
coworkers on a deeper level.

Mars shifts into fel-

low fire sign Sagittarius and 
your ruling house, the house of 
creativity. Now is the time to 

pursue your wildest ideas. Don’t 
be afraid to let your imagination 

sway you into new directions 
with your artistic process; you 
may unexpectedly create some-

thing extraordinary.

Mars enters Sagittarius 

and your fourth house of home 
and family, spurring you to turn 

your attention to your home. 
Now is a good time to initiate a 
renovation plan or reach out to 
a family member. Now is also 
a great opportunity to start 

working on projects you’ve been 

planning for a long time.

This week, Mars enters 

your sign and your first house 
of the self. At this time, you may 
feel more invigorated to pursue 

anything you’re passionate 
about. Especially with a new 

semester starting soon, if you’ve 
been wanting to take a class out-
side of your major or join a new 

organization, this is a great 

opportunity to do so.

When Mars enters 

Sagittarius and your second 

house of love and finances, you 
may develop more confidence in 
speaking candidly to others about 

both romantic and monetary 
matters. Scorpios can often be 
very guarded, but now is the 

time to let down your walls and 
express your honest thoughts.

Since Mercury rules over 

intellectual pursuits, this is a good 
opportunity to ask your instructors 
any final questions and form a study

time to work on creative projects. And 
not to bring down your mood, but you 

should also be sure to manage your 
expectations since it is easy to be too 

optimistic and somewhat careless 
at this time. This is a great time to

The lack of diversity in public schools: A reflection of my time with Black Men Read

When I take the time to reflect on my child-

hood, I cannot help but appreciate the parts of 
my upbringing that nurtured a love for who 
I am and the cultural community that I come 
from. Growing up in a Black household in a 
largely Black area, I obtained ample exposure 
to my culture, especially through literature and 
the arts. As a young child, the sound of Stevie 
Wonder’s “Sir Duke” or Chaka Khan’s “One for 
All Time” would be the first thing that I would 
hear on weekend mornings, invigorating me as 
I started my day. When I woke up to this music, 
I instantly knew that someone in my household 
was downstairs cleaning. Sure enough, I would 
walk downstairs to find one of my parents 
scrubbing the counters in the kitchen, one of 
the many rooms in our home whose walls were 
covered with the work of Black artists. Wheth-
er it be a depiction of a man playing the blues on 
his saxophone for a live audience or a painting 
that simply shows a family praying over their 
meal, it was important to my parents that my 
siblings and I were constantly surrounded by 
positive and meaningful visual depictions of 
people who looked like us. 

The commitment that my family embraced 

to showcasing our culture extended outside 
the four walls of our home. When driving us 
to school, my mom often played a CD that my 
dad made for her with all her favorite songs, 
which quickly became some of our favorites 
too. In fact, I often refused to get out of the car 
until I could finish belting the last note of Mary 
J. Blige’s “Be Without You.” When I eventu-
ally did leave my mother’s car, I entered class-
rooms that similarly incorporated aspects of 
African-American culture into our education. 
Throughout my secondary education, it was 
normal for me to have English curricula that 
were mostly, if not completely, centered around 
the works of Black authors and the actions of 
Black revolutionaries. Whether it was writ-
ing papers about the Harlem Renaissance and 
watching “A Raisin in the Sun” in my seventh 
grade English class or reading Toni Morrison’s 
“Song of Solomon” in my AP Literature class, I 
could always count on being able to see myself 
and my people in many of my English classes’ 
curricula. Not only did I feel represented in 
the curriculum, but also felt seen by those who 
were teaching it to me. A majority of my teach-
ers during K–12 were Black, and not only did 
they make it a point to teach us our culture and 
history, but to affirm our ability to succeed in 
this world as Black people. I was also able to 
see Black people in positions of power, with my 
principals and administrators as leading exam-
ples. This benefit also extended to outside the 
school grounds. I was also fortunate enough 
in that I lived in a community filled with Black 
people who had gone far in their respective 
careers. All of these actions made by my family 
and school district were done with the inten-
tion of cultivating a sense of pride in our racial 
identity. I can say for myself that it worked.

As beneficial as this environment was for 

me, I soon realized that it created a blind spot 

in me. I thought that embedding positive Black 
representations into a child’s experience was 
how communities typically operated, because 
that was how my community operated. I did 
not know anything beyond my community 
until I had the opportunity to have conversa-
tions with Black peers in different places. It was 
through these conversations that I realized we 
didn’t all have a common experience. Many of 
them told stories of feeling disconnected from 
our culture and ignorant to our history, a direct 
consequence of curricula that did not serve 
them or honor their culture and history. I was 
saddened to hear about their experiences living 
in predominantly non-Black spaces without 
role models who looked like them beyond the 
walls of their household. Hearing these stories 
created a feeling of discontentment inside of 
me. When I think about the pride that I take in 
where I came from and the passion I have for 
advocating for my community, it all stems from 
my culturally-affirming upbringing. I can also 
say that my love for reading came from being 
able to read books that I felt represented me. 
Knowing that others weren’t privy to these 
benefits didn’t sit right with me. Originally, I 
thought this was a phenomenon that I would 
be forced to accept. Fortunately, I was wrong. 
An opportunity to fuel my discontentment into 
meaningful change came when I was selected 
for a fellowship through the Ginsberg Center.

For the 2020-21 school year, I got chosen to 

be a Community Leadership Fellow through 
the Edward Ginsberg Center at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. Through this opportunity, 
I was paired with a community organization 
in the southeastern Michigan area and was 
paid to act as their intern for the year. Based on 
the interest form that I filled out, I was paired 
with Black Men Read. An organization based 
in Ypsilanti, their mission is to “uplift Black 
men, all children, and all communities through 
stories of the African diaspora.” I instantly 
felt connected to the organization’s initiatives 
because of how they aligned with the cultural 
exposure and pride that was interwoven into 
my childhood experience. Turns out, creating 
environments similar to the one I was privy to 
as a child was the inspiration for the organiza-
tion’s creation. 

During my first weekly meeting with my 

supervisor, Tamara Tucker-Ibarisha, she told 
me the story of how Black Men came to be. In 
2016, her daughter went to school with the son of 
Yodit Mesfin-Johnson, who would go on to co-
create Black Men Read with her. One thing that 
was undeniable about the school’s atmosphere 
was the lack of Black male teachers — there were 
none. The absence of Black male influences in 
this academic environment became so apparent 
to one of the school’s teachers that she took the 
time to ask Mesfin-Johnson if she knew of any 
Black men who would be willing to come to the 
school to read to their students. After approach-
ing Tucker-Ibarisha with the proposition, the 
two decided to invite some of the Black men 
from their communities to the school to read 
a story to the children, specifically a story that 
centers a Black child. This initiative was well 
received by the students, resulting in these sto-
rytimes becoming a somewhat regular occasion 

at the school. Seeing the success of this initiative 
and realizing that so few students in the Washt-
enaw County area get to experience having a 
Black male teacher, they decided to start invit-
ing Black men to read at Blackstone Bookstore 
in order to reach a larger audience. Similar to 
the storytimes they hosted at their children’s 
school, the events at Blackstone consisted of the 
kids enjoying a story being read by a Black man. 
However, since Blackstone acted as a less formal 
space compared to a classroom, the kids were 
also able to interact freely with each other. The 
atmosphere of these events was so relaxed that 
the storytimes at the bookstore were affection-
ately referred to as “book parties,” bringing an 
air of joy and celebration to the idea of reading.

The book parties became just as much of a 

success as the classroom storytimes, with par-
ents commenting on how these events have 
cultivated a love of confidence in reading in 
their children. As a result, the parents request-
ed for more parties to be hosted. Mesfin-John-
son and Tucker-Ibarisha, happily obliged and 
started making events at Blackstone an occur-
rence that happened at least once a month. The 
willingness of these two women to fulfill this 
need expressed by the community is how Black 
Men Read was officially created.

Before the start of the pandemic, in-person 

storytimes and book parties comprised the 
foundation of the offerings that Black Men 
Read provided the Washtenaw County com-
munity. Unfortunately, as the first few months 
of 2020 saw the increasing spread and severity 
of the coronavirus, gathering children in one 
small space became less and less feasible. The 
progressing state of COVID-19 and the way 
it was altering the nation’s social landscape 
meant that Black Men Read needed an alter-
native strategy for connecting with children in 
the community. This is where I came in.

Since my internship started just six months 

after the virus put a pause on the organization’s 
in-person events, it was my job to help them 
replicate the sense of community they had cre-
ated in public spaces and transfer it to digital 
platforms. This meant that I spent a lot of my 
time helping to develop their visual program-
ming, mainly their YouTube channel, which 
would consist of videos of Black men reading 
children’s books, asking comprehension ques-
tions and answering questions about their lives 
in order to create a connection with the audi-
ence. To be more specific, my role was to pick 
out the books and create a script for each video, 
which includes transcribing the words of the 
book, writing the comprehension questions 
and coming up with personal questions for the 

men to answer.

As I started choosing books to be read, I 

began to realize how much intention goes into 
crafting a curriculum that centers Black culture 
while also telling the stories of Black people. 
Each book that I chose reflected the specific 
theme that Tucker-Ibarisha, who served as 
my supervisor, chose for the given season. The 
theme for fall was confidence, which led to us 
choosing “I Am Every Good Thing” by Der-
rick Barnes to be read. With the winter season 
encompassing Black History Month, the story 
“Wind Flyers” by Angela Johnson, which tells 
the story of a Tuskegee Airman, was a perfect 
choice. Lastly, we chose “Over and Under the 
Pond” by Kate Messner in order to celebrate 
the coming of spring and the desire that comes 
with it. The different themes, along with the 
very different stories that were told in each one, 
were nothing short of a result of a calculated 
strategy. My supervisor and I chose the themes 
and the resulting books as a way to provide a 
holistic depiction of Black life. With these three 
books, we highlighted milestone achievements 
in the Black community while also showcasing 
Black people enjoying the everyday wonders of 
life. We aimed to convey the message that yes, 
Black people are exceptional, but we don’t have 
to be doing something monumental in order to 
be worthy of being seen.

After we chose the books, I shifted gears 

to creating the script. Not only did the scripts 
include the words of the book that would be 
read and the comprehension questions that 
would be asked, but they also detailed instruc-
tions for how words would be presented on 
the screen. Because Black Men Read aimed to 
improve literacy through these videos, it was 
essential that the words were presented in a 
way that was conducive to kids’ understand-
ing and retention of basic vocabulary and 
phonetic skills. With the help of Nuola Akinde, 
Black Men Read’s Director of Culture and Cur-
riculum and the founder of Kekere Freedom 
School, I developed techniques to ensure that 
our literacy-improving goal would be met. The 
main strategy I utilized was highlighting dolch 
words, which are frequently-used English 
vocabulary words that are often used to teach 
kids to read. Dolch words include basic words 
such as “the” and “for.” For every book that we 
were recording a reading of, I wrote down the 
words of the book and highlighted all the Dolch 
words in them, as a way to signal to the design 
team that those words needed to be empha-
sized on the screen. Once the Dolch words 
were highlighted, I moved onto the compre-
hension questions. In creating the questions, 
I was tasked with ensuring the questions 
required the children to practice their critical 
thinking skills in a way that challenged them 
without being too difficult which was tedious. 
Yet, from performing these two tasks, I gained 
an appreciation for both the organization I was 
working for and the teachers in my childhood 
that worked hard to provide the same benefits 
to me and my peers.

Whenever I finished creating a script for 

the YouTube videos based on a given book, it 
was then time for me to correspond with the 
volunteers who committed to being the ones to 

actually star in the video. While instructing me 
on how to communicate with the readers, my 
supervisor casually mentioned that their deci-
sion to center the organization around Black 
men was about more than just filling the void 
of Black male figures in secondary education. 
The creation of Black Men Read also stemmed 
from a desire to dispel the stereotype that Black 
men are not involved in their communities, a 
stereotype that Tucker-Ibarisha says — and 
I can confirm — is very untrue. Because the 
organization was serving as a form of correc-
tive representation for Black men, she told me 
that she was intentional about choosing men 
who she knew were active in their communi-
ties and who were passionate about leaving a 
lasting impact on the lives of children.

After spending time emailing instructions 

back-and-forth between myself and the read-
ers, I finally obtained the video footage that 
would be used to create the YouTube videos. 
When I pressed play, I was met with the enthu-
siastic tone of a man reading the book “I Am 
Every Good Thing” in a way that made the 
story come to life. Once he finished reading the 
book and asking the comprehension question, 
he went on to talk about his life. Here, he includ-
ed a description of his career and expressed 
how much he enjoyed being a husband and 
father. Reviewing this video made it clear why 
he — and all the other men who would read — 
were chosen to represent the mission of Black 
Men Read. The passion that these men had for 
connecting with children and improving their 
literacy reminded me of the dedication exhib-
ited by the men in my own community, who 
were always very hands-on. The ideas that 
these videos, and the men, would contribute to 
Black children being able to see themselves in 
educational spaces warmed my heart.

While providing uplifting representations 

to Black kids is an integral part of the organiza-
tion’s purpose, their mission statement explic-
itly states that their overall goal is to empower 
“all children.” My supervisor would sometimes 
reiterate this during our Monday afternoon 
meetings. One day, I asked her if there was any 
intention behind aiming to serve all children 
instead of tailoring the program to Black chil-
dren. Her answer surprised me. She told me 
that, oftentimes, when a police officer shoots 
an unarmed Black man, they defend them-
selves by saying they felt threatened. Her view 
was that, in some cases, the officer is telling the 
truth when they say that line, because whether 
the subject is actually presenting a threat or not, 
the social narrative of Black men is that they 
are to be feared. Because of this, she wanted to 
make the Black Men Read’s initiative available 
to all children in order to prevent and combat 
the development and progression of these irra-
tional fears of Black men. 

This was in no way said as a justification for 

police brutality — in fact, it’s the exact oppo-
site. She explained that there not being enough 
positive representations of Black people in the 
media and in academic settings causes people 
to develop damaging biases against Black 
people that continuously go unchallenged.

I’m startled awake as my 30th alarm drones 

monotonously in my ear. 

I’m drenched in a cold sweat, cursing as I 

realize it’s 12:50 and my class starts at 1:00 p.m. 
I swing my legs over the edge of my bed and 
scurry through my room, grasping for my final 
clean pair of jeans and a sweater that’s been 
worn three other times this week. I can’t see the 
floor of my room, but I’ve learned to navigate 
the war zone, memorized the clearings that I 
can step on without tripping over landmines of 
laundry or discarded Amazon boxes or takeout 
containers. I sprint down the stairs and clamber 
into my car, equally as messy, and speed down 
to class; I make it at 12:59 on the dot. 

All of this to say, I’m the messiest person I 

know. 

It’s an unexpected idiosyncrasy of mine, 

and I’m shocked when people tell me that I 
seem sooo put together. When they tell me 
this, I manage a strangled laugh, because I’m 
about as composed as a four-car collision or 
an oil spill or a blazing forest being put out by 
water guns. But I’ve become well-trained in 
the art of deception, and I revel in my expert 
ability to keep the uncontrolled chaos just 
below the surface. 

When the messiness seeps through the 

cracks, begging to be seen and heard and felt, I 
do not panic; instead, I turn it into a punchline. 
I wear it shamelessly on my sleeve, roll my eyes 
and say, “I know, I’m such a mess!” I internalize 
it, trying to make it an endearing personality 
trait, like when a doe-eyed child talks too much 
or when a clumsy pet scampers into a wall one-
too-many times. I think if I brandish it like a 
comedic weapon, take this ghastly flaw and 
furiously shine it, the carefully curated lacquer 
will make it sparkle, make it lovable somehow.

But my ownership of the mess doesn’t make 

it any more sexy or captivating. Up close, it is 
grotesque and all-encompassing, permeating 
every corner of my life. My speech is messy, 
punctuated by stammers and sloppily-strung-
together tangents. My writing is messy, 
wrought with technical errors and screaming-
red truths that border on unprovoked 
oversharing. My room is messy, as is my car 
and closet and mind. If it’s possible to be a hot 
mess, then I am on fire, always half-heartedly 
snuffing out the flames but never really putting 
out the blaze. Living like this demands a bizarre 
form of introspection, and lately, I’ve spent a lot 
of time trying to decipher what the mess means.

I tell you without really saying it, because I 

lack the courage, and I think the mess likes to 
speak for me anyway. When I say, “I’m sorry 
about my room,” what I mean is that I’m tired. 

That the days bleed into weeks and months 
and a task as simple as laundry would drain 
every iota of my energy. That my living space 
has become a battleground and I’ve settled for 
a truce. That I’ve opted for subordinate forms 
of self-punishment, that I don’t deserve a clean 
room or a safe space, that it’d be just another 
thing for me to inevitably destroy. That I’m 
fraught with failures: I forgot to eat today, I 
forgot to text you back, I forgot how to put out 
the million little fires, how to be anything other 
than this. 

Maybe I don’t tell you any of this because 

sorry is easier, anyway. It fits like a well-loved 
sweater, a default word rolling off of my tongue 
with miraculous ease as if it’s not leaving 
bruises in the back of my throat. All the sorries 
buzz around like gnats, trapped behind heavy, 
chapped lips. They scream, “I’m sorry I’m such 
a mess and I’m sorry that all I have to show for it 
is this bloody, mangled sorry I’m biting down on.” 
I’m sorry that sorry doesn’t clean up messes.

When I set aside the time to clean up my 

room, or my car, or my inbox, I hate myself for 
it, wondering when I let it get like this. I sift 
through the clothes on my floor, aging them 
with principles of superposition like deeply 
embedded fossils. I become an accidental 
archaeologist, realizing the shirt at the bottom 
of the pile is stained with September’s sadness 
and the jeans draped over the back of my desk 

chair are perfumed with the exhaustion of 
exams. The coffee cup marks on my desk 
culminate like rings in a tree trunk, and I realize 
this mess is old. I realize it might’ve been here 
before me, roots planted too stubbornly in the 
ground for me to ever move.

I give myself cheap cop-outs, blaming it 

on school or stress or grief. Because what is 
grief if not a mess you can never quite quell? A 
coffee cup cemented to your nightstand, a pile 
of laundry slowly towering on the floor despite 
you never adding to it, something you can’t 
bring yourself to confront or clean up. In those 
moments, I decide the easiest thing to do is let 
the mess win and lay in it instead, let it swallow 
me whole because it’s earned its rightful place 
there and has grown too prideful to ever go 
away. Most nights, I do.

Other nights, I clean up. It takes two cups 

of coffee, three loads of laundry, four garbage 
bags and countless breaks strewn in between. 
I curl up atop half-folded clothes and let the 
ache wash over me, cruel and demanding, and 
it takes everything in me to continue. But I 
do. I laboriously chip away at the mess until it 
disappears entirely until the bed gets made and 
the room smells of Febreze and fresh starts. I 
resent myself the entire time, like a beguiled 
mother cleaning up after a reckless toddler. I 
pretend it isn’t my mess, that the girl who let 
it spiral is just a lazy liability I’m forced to take 

care of. But the satisfaction of it all is tinged 
with shame, because I remember that I am her 
and that means the mess hasn’t gone away, not 
really. Maybe it never will, and maybe it’s less 
about the mess and more about the resolve 
required to clean it up. 

These days, I’ve been trying to redefine 

the relationship I have with cleaning. I mold 
it into something that’s more meditative than 
miserable, something I do for myself rather 
than to spite myself. I do it because I love 
the girl who let it get this bad. I was there 
on the sleepless nights, felt the dull ache in 
her chest that persisted for weeks on end, 
and I understand why a mess was easier to 
maintain. She deserves compassion, too, even 
on her worst days. Even when she can’t muster 
the will to see the world through anything 
other than jaded, glassy eyes, even when she 
destroys everything she touches. Even then, 
she deserves to rest her debilitated bones 
on warm linens, to have a space that is rid of 
the reminders of her failures. When I say I’m 
cleaning my room tonight, what I mean is, 
I’m extending her the same tenderness she’s 
always extended me. I’m thanking her for 
trying. 

In the same breath, I thank my friends for 

being brave enough to love the mess.

nflation has once again gripped 
the nation. The consumer price 

index for October indicated that prices 
rose 6.2% from the year prior. The 
University of Michigan’s Consumer 
Sentiment 
Survey’s 
preliminary 

findings for November were the 
lowest in a decade. According to the 
survey, consumers believe inflation 
is here to stay, and that President Joe 
Biden and the Democrat-led Congress 
have not effectively responded to it. 

Here in Michigan, the effects of 

inflation are slightly more palpable 
than in other parts of the country. 
According to a Detroit Free Press 
article, prices in the Midwest are up 
6.6% compared with the 5.4% increase 
seen in the Northeast. 

This is a serious problem for 

Democrats. 
Conservative 
media 

outlets were quick to coin the term 
“Bidenflation.” 
Republicans 
in 

Congress latched onto the rising prices 
to attack Biden’s ambitious spending 
plans, affectionately re-naming his 
“Build 
Back 
Better” 
framework 

“Build Back Broke.” Given the flood 
of 
post-Virginia 
gubernatorial 

election commentary suggesting that 
Democrats should be worried about 
big losses in the midterms next year, 
beating the Republican’s challenge is 
vitally important. 

So far, Biden’s response to inflation 

has been faltering at best. While 
he did acknowledge that “inflation 
hurts (Americans’) pocketbooks,” 
he also misappropriated a letter 
from 17 Nobel Laureates that stated 
his social spending would “ease 
longer-term inflationary pressures” 
by conveniently leaving out “longer-
term” in his speeches.

Assuaging the public’s fears about 

inflation is notorious for sending 
former presidents to their political 
grave. 
Both 
Presidents 
Gerald 

Ford and Jimmy Carter likely lost 
re-election because of their attempts 
to convince the country to curtail 
spending in order to reduce inflation. 

In a Politico article, former Republican 
aide Bill Hoagland was quoted saying, 
“I feel a little bit sorry for the president. 
A lot of this is out of control.” 

Economist 
Daniel 
McFadden, 

one of the signatories on the Nobel 
laureate letter, argued that inflation 
is the result of both constrained 
supply chains and “pent-up demand” 
from consumers emerging from the 
pandemic. Wrangling global supply 
chains and an entire country of people 
is an impossible task for any person, 
even a president, to accomplish.

Nonetheless, Biden needs to take 

Americans’ concerns about inflation 
more 
seriously. 
Economists 
and 

officials at the Federal Reserve are 
paid to diagnose the causes of inflation 
and whether it will be transient or not. 
Biden’s job is to listen to and engage with 
the concerns raised by his constituents. 

When 
Biden 
visited 
General 

Motor’s Detroit plant, Factory ZERO, 
recently, he delivered a lengthy speech 
to celebrate the recent passage of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act and emphasize the benefits it 
would bestow upon Michiganders. He 
highlighted the money going towards 
fixing Michigan’s infamously poor 
roads, the tax credits for consumers 
purchasing 
union-made 
electric 

vehicles, the money for eliminating 
PFAS and made a shout out to all the 
Michigan Democrats in Congress who 
helped pass the bill. He did mention 
inflation, but only to bring up that a 
few Wall Street rating agencies echoed 
the Nobel Laureates and expressed 
they believed the social spending plan 
would “not add to inflation pressures.”

Roads, cars and unions all seem to 

hit the speaking points for the older 
Michigan electorate. And yet, I would 
bet that inflation probably matters 
just as much to most Michiganders. 
Bringing up the statements of a few 
Wall Street rating agencies or even a 
body of well-respected economists to 
dismiss concerns about inflation with 
the wave of a hand does not lead the 
public to believe that you understand 
their concerns. 

It is not unreasonable to suggest 

that Biden has nothing to gain from 

switching his strategy. Greg Ip of the 
Wall Street Journal points out that 
since former President Barack Obama’s 
time in office, voters’ opinions on the 
economy have been driven largely by 
partisan identification rather than 
actual economic indicators. Further 
acknowledgement of the Republican 
outcry might just energize GOP 
campaigns come the 2022 midterms. 

But at the same time, it intuitively 

feels like ignoring inflation, or at least 
shakily trying to prop up “Build Back 
Better” as an easy fix for the problem, 
is not the best plan. 

On an episode of the New York 

Times’ podcast “The Daily,” economics 
reporter Ben Casselman emphasized 
the importance of remembering that 
even if the economy looks good in 
the aggregate, the economy is not 
experienced by individuals that way.

According to Casselman, lower-

income workers might have seen 
dramatic increases in their wages due 
to the labor shortage, but they also face 
more demanding and stressful work 
environments because of that same 
labor shortage. And even if inflation 
has not increased the cost of living 
for most Americans, that certainly 
does not mean everybody escaped the 
negative effects of inflation. 

Biden needs to come down to the 

same level as the average American. 
Instead of allowing the discussion 
over inflation to center around 
policymakers’ high-brow economic 
theories, he should make a concerted 
effort to publicly acknowledge that 
many voters are more concerned 
about inflation and the impact it might 
have on their lives than the fate of the 
social spending plan in the Senate. 
Taking the time to engage with his 
constituents that are concerned about 
inflation, or addressing the nation 
on the subject, would help make 
good on Biden’s promise to serve as a 
president for all Americans, not just his 
supporters. Elections are determined 
by what voters think and feel. If voters 
feel that their leaders have neglected 
them, then the massive benefits of a 
spending bill like “Build Back Better” 
appear very little.

A

cross the United States, anti-
vaccine protestors are using 

antisemitic imagery and Holocaust 
comparisons in an offensive attempt 
to compare vaccine mandates to 
the treatment of Jews during the 
Holocaust.

Recently, 
Rob 
Astorino, 
a 

Republican gubernatorial candidate 
from New York, made headlines for 
hosting an anti-vaccine event featuring 
signs with swastikas. The use of a 
swastika was especially egregious 
because the protest was being held 
outside of the office of Assemblyman 
Jeffrey Dinowitz, who is Jewish. 
The protest centered around a bill 
Assemblyman Dinowitz introduced 
that would require the COVID-19 
vaccinations for school children.

This specific protest hit particularly 

close to home for me as it occurred in a 
community close to where I am from. 
The section of the Bronx where the 
protest was held is an area I know well, 
having worked in that neighborhood 
at my congressman’s office. The 

area has a large and vibrant Jewish 
community. The fact that protestors 
came to this specific area with their 
antisemitic imagery and protested 
outside the office of a Jewish lawmaker 
is egregious but not surprising. 

The trend of invoking the Holocaust 

to protest COVID-19 restrictions and 
mandates extends far beyond this one 
event. Since the start of the pandemic, 
there have been many outrageous 
comparisons made between COVID-
19 protocols and the treatment of Jews 
during the Holocaust.

With the rollout of the vaccine and 

the implantation of vaccine mandates, 
there have been many inaccurate 
comparisons between the Holocaust 
and the vaccine mandates. In Maine, 
a Republican lawmaker compared 
the Democratic governor’s health 
care workers’ vaccine mandate to the 
medical experiments performed by Dr. 
Josef Mengele and the Nazis during 
World War II. This incendiary claim 
tries to compare forms of torture and 
human experiments in the Holocaust 
with a safe vaccine that has gone 
through strenuous peer-reviewed 
clinical trials and has oversight from 
multiple medical bodies. 

The chairman of the Oklahoma 

Republican 
Party 
compared 

companies requiring vaccines to Jews 
being forced to wear yellow Stars of 
David to identify them as Jews in Nazi 
Germany. Many anti-vaccine protests 
across the US have seen protestors 
wearing yellow Stars of David on their 
clothes, a direct reference to the stars 
that Jews were forced to wear during 
the Holocaust. 

This comparison is unbelievably 

disrespectful and demonstrates how 
anti-vaccine advocates are trying to 
co-opt one of the most painful parts 
of Jewish history and twist it to fit 
their anti-vaccine rhetoric. The use of 
swastikas, Stars of David, and other 
symbols at vaccine protests is truly 
reprehensible and serves to minimize 
the severity of the Holocaust. 

This is clear: There are no possible 

comparisons that can be made between 
what Jews endured during the 
Holocaust and any kind of COVID-19 
restrictions. The Holocaust was one of 
the worst periods in our world’s history. 
Millions of Jews were stripped of their 
rights, their freedom and their lives. 

Concerns about inflation can be legitimate, 

Democrats should pay attention

Comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust is 
abhorrent: All antisemitism must be condemned

W

e are fast approaching a year 
of 
a 
Democratic-controlled 

government that has been plagued 
by ups and downs of many varieties. 
These include the woes of handling the 
COVID-19 pandemic, a debt-ceiling 
crisis and the legislative leviathan 
of passing an infrastructure bill and 
spending bill. President Joe Biden’s 
popularity is at an all-time low, despite 
the passage of his infrastructure bill 
after months of party in-fighting. 
If only one word could be used to 
describe the government of this year, 
it would be factionalism. Factionalism 
has defined the fight in the debt 
crisis, allowing Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, 
D-Ariz., and Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., 
to wield an intense amount of power 
while being the smallest faction, as 
well as delaying some of the biggest 
items Joe Biden and the Democrats 
ran on.

Manchin 
has 
tempered 

Democratic ambitions time and 

time again. In the fight over the 
infrastructure 
bill, 
progressives 

butted heads against the party 
establishment. 
In 
October, 

Democrats found an unlikely ally 
in Republican leader Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., after Sinema 
and Manchin vowed to support the 
filibuster that created the debt-ceiling 
crisis. Factionalism has hobbled the 
Democrats for nearly a year now, but 
the issues that have hampered their 
party in the House and the Senate 
may save some prospects of power 
after the midterms. It may provide 
them with strength if, and when, 
they lose the House and Senate, as 
long as they can pull it together under 
minority leadership.

The writing is on the wall: 

In the 2022 midterm elections, 
the Democrats will lose seats. 
Numerous House members are 
retiring out of fear of the outcome 
of the 2022 election. Empirically, 
this is supported, as members of 
government retire when the outlook 
for them and their party is bleak. 
We can also quantitatively support 

the already popular belief that 
the president’s party loses seats 
in midterm elections, barring any 
extraordinary turnout at the polls.

Yet some light can be shed on the 

future of a divided government: The 
ailments of the Democrats also pollute 
an incredibly fractured Republican 
Party. The GOP has recently displayed 
intense factionalism that could come 
to boil over in the upcoming midterms 
and even after. The Republicans have 
long faced in-fighting, even during 
Trump’s presidency, as those loyal 
to Trump above all else grew in 
number and rank. The bitter dispute 
continued after the election and saw 
some Trump critics, namely U.S. 
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., lose their 
leadership positions and even be 
stripped of recognition by their state 
Republican parties. 

Yet the factional disputes are ever-

growing and changing. The New York 
Times reports that there are now five 
factions within the Republican base. 
These include two Trump-focused 
factions, two factions that oppose the 
former president and a final faction 

comprised of individuals who often 
subscribe to outlandish conspiracy 
theories and associate themselves 
with QAnon.

In Congress, these factions are 

most evident in the House where 
Republican minority leader Kevin 
McCarthy, R-Calif., has found his 
hands full. McCarthy has had to try 
to defend some of the more extreme 
members of his party, as well as 
reel other ones in. U.S. Reps. Paul 
Gosar, R-Ariz., Lauren Boebert, 
R-Fla., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, 
R-Ga., have all come under fire for 
their controversial and sometimes 
violent remarks towards Progressive 
Caucus members. With McCarthy 
attempting to mitigate damage, the 
aforementioned 
representatives 

continued to heat things up. The 
factional war escalated with the 
passage of the infrastructure bill 
being supported by 13 Republicans 
in the House. Greene and other 
members of the Freedom Caucus 
began an all-out attack on the 
perceived traitors. 

This is not the first time Greene has 

come into conflict with Republican 
leadership, as she lost her committee 
assignments 
earlier 
this 
year. 

Appearing recently on U.S. Rep. Matt 
Gaetz, R-Fla.’s, podcast, Greene made 
a list of demands that McCarthy 
would need to fulfill to earn support 
from her and other members of 
the Freedom Caucus in the pursuit 
of Speaker of the House after the 
expected Republican victory in the 
midterm elections. The factions of 
the Republican Party are putting 
an immense amount of pressure on 
Republican leadership to bend to 
their whims. Leadership must tread 
carefully to maintain support and 
keep their positions, as the Freedom 
Caucus has ousted a speaker six years 
ago. McCarthy has to tread this fine 
line or else upset either moderates 
or the more extreme members, with 
both groups proving to be pivotal 
more often than not. 

McCarthy’s main goal, whether 

Greene and Gaetz and others 
recognize it or not, is and always will 
be party unity. He recognizes the 
importance of a unified party that 

is able to effectively mobilize when 
it needs to. He also recognizes the 
necessity of it for his own leadership 
ambitions. The worst-case scenario 
for McCarthy is if the Freedom 
Caucus leads a revolt and splinters 
the party apart, destroying unity 
and jeopardizing the advantage 
Republicans 
can 
gain 
in 
the 

midterms.

There has been a lackluster showing 

from a Democrat-controlled House, 
Senate, and presidency, hindered by 
factionalism and overshadowed by 
an expected catastrophic defeat in a 
year’s time. However, there is yet light 
at the end of the dark tunnel, and there 
is yet a way to see this glass as half-
full. The Democrats have something 
to look forward to in the increased 
factionalism of the House and Senate. 
Soon the Republicans will be vying 
for the House majority, and they have 
some major issues to contend with 
prior to the 2022 midterm elections. 
While factionalism has slowed the 
Democrats down substantially, it 
could cause the Republican Party to 
come undone in due time.

The Democrats’ struggle could be a prize come midterms

E

arlier this month, Democrats lost unified 
control of Virginia state government to 

Glenn Youngkin, a mild-mannered, sweater 
vest-wearing Republican who loves to talk about 
schools. Leading up to the election, education was 
consistently ranked as one of the most important 
issues to Virginia voters. The Youngkin campaign 
addressed education by constantly denouncing 
critical race theory, which some, including Terry 
McAuliffe, called a “racist dog whistle.” Critical 
race theory, though, is not being taught in Virginia. 
Or in any other public school. And in other policy 
areas related to education and children, McAuliffe 
and his fellow Democrats have specific plans and 
superior records. 

Take a look at Glenn Youngkin’s education 

platform. Prior to his victory, his campaign 
website offered a page titled “Restore Excellence 
in Education” — it has since been removed. The 
section had seven sentences. One of them reiterated 
Youngkin’s desire to ban critical race theory, which 
— again — is not being taught in Virginia schools. 
The others included keeping schools open five 
days a week as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, 
getting students ready for college, expanding 
charter schools and increasing funding for special 
education and teachers. Virginia schools are 
legally obligated to offer in-person education, per 
a law passed by the Democratic state government 
last summer. Preparing students for college 
is an admittedly noble goal (if vague), and it is 
facilitated by the easy access to community college 
provided by the “Get Skilled, Get a Job, Give Back” 
program passed by the Democratic-controlled 
state government last year. This program makes 
community college free for middle-income 
students looking to work jobs in high demand. 
And, of course, there is increasing school funding, 
something McAuliffe also supports and actually 
did when he was governor of Virginia from 2014 to 
2018. Youngkin’s education plans, when not devoid 
of detail, address issues McAuliffe and Virginia 

Democrats have been working on for years.

Youngkin’s more expansive plan, found in a 

press release that has since been removed from 
his website, was slightly less vague. It included 
another bullet point about critical race theory, 
along with more vague goals, like “equip our 
students to be the top-performing students in 
the country.” Notably, neither his press release 
nor his campaign website say how he intends to 
accomplish any of these goals. Youngkin’s most 
specific points pertain to school accreditation 
standards, something McAuliffe adjusted as 
governor to deemphasize standardized testing. 
McAuliffe’s actions were bipartisan and stemmed 
from opposition to high-stakes standardized 
testing by teacher and parent groups. Youngkin’s 
plan also includes a promise to “ensure schools 
are never again closed unnecessarily for extended 
periods of time,” likely a reference to school 
closures last year, which were necessary to combat 
COVID-19. Beyond once again offering vague 
goals, Youngkin’s full education platform solely 
focuses on critiquing McAuliffe and incumbent 
Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s records, even 
when their records consist of bipartisan action or 
life-saving pandemic responses. 

McAuliffe’s education platform, found in 

a six-page document linked to his campaign 
website, emphasizes not only his past work on 
education and issues in need of a solution, but 
actual solutions. McAuliffe planned to address 
teacher shortages, something plaguing Ann 
Arbor as well as Virginia, by raising teacher 
salaries above the national average. He planned 
to include 3-year-olds in Virginia’s subsidized 
pre-K program. He planned to expand existing 
workforce training programs to allow Virginia 
students to immediately enter the workforce 
upon graduating high school. In addressing race, 
McAuliffe argued in favor not of teaching critical 
race theory, but of better integrating schools 
and addressing gaps in funding correlated with 
majority-minority schools. McAuliffe identifies 
real problems and proposes reasonable ways to 
address them.

Crucially, McAuliffe is not unique in his support 

for effective education plans. Michigan Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer signed a $17.1 billion education 
budget plan last summer. It contained provisions 
to close funding gaps between Michigan schools, 
along with an expansion of state preschool 
programs. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed 
a $123.9 billion education package, looking to 
increase school presence in commwunities and 
bolster special education programs, along with 
expanding access to preschool. 

When education is on the ballot, 
Democrats are the best choice

I

t’s the most wonderful time of the year: 
the holiday season is upon us. Streets 

are adorned with gleaming lights, stores 
play Mariah Carey and Michael Bublé non-
stop and your home is likely glittering with 
decorations. I don’t know what your holiday 
tradition(s) may be, but for me, it’s watching 
almost every Christmas movie before Dec. 
25. Each year, a few stand out — I can’t resist 
Macaulay Culkin beating up Joe Pesci and 
Daniel Stern in the “Home Alone” movies.

If you haven’t seen “Home Alone,” I won’t 

spoil it. Go watch it right now. Here’s a brief 
synopsis: a little boy played by Macaulay 
Culkin is left alone in his suburban Chicago 
house when his family goes on vacation and 
learns that two robbers, played by Joe Pesci 
and Daniel Stern, plan to break in. All hell 
breaks loose as he tries to protect his home. 
It’s hilarious, Christmassy and delightful. 
The entire cast shines. However, this article 
is not a “Home Alone” review. It’s about 
politics. Because, these days, what isn’t? 

What does a brilliant holiday movie have 

to do with politics? In this case, there is a 
clear link between the original film’s sequel, 
“Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,” which 
is almost as magnificent as the first, and the 
nightmare looming larger with the passing 
of every year — the 2024 presidential 
election. The connection is that in both 
“Home Alone 2” and 2024, history repeats 
itself. 

“Home 
Alone 
2” 
features 
Kevin 

McCallister, the protagonist, replicating 
the same mistakes from the first film. The 
family forgets about him once again, there 
is no way to reach him and Kevin’s mom, 
played by Catherine O’Hara, is worried 
sick for most of the movie. Except this time, 
Kevin ends up in New York somehow, living 
like a king while staying at The Plaza Hotel. 
The two robbers, Harry and Marv, are 
back too, aiming to steal the Christmas Eve 
earnings of a famed toy store. McCallister 
learns of their plan and aims to stop them 
anew. The 2024 election will, similarly, be a 
repetition of 2020’s election, except the plot 
will be much, much worse.

No one wants to redo 2020. Literally no 

one. Democrats want to win the election 
without having to respond to claims of 
fraud, moderate Republicans don’t want 

to deal with those claims either and the 
Trump wing of the Republican Party 
wants to actually emerge victorious this 
time. Nevertheless, the most likely scenario 
is that we will see a facsimile of 2020, or 
something more horrible. It is unlikely that 
either candidate will win with a significant 
majority of the popular or electoral college 
vote. Republicans just showed they have 
an impressive hand heading into 2022. 
Glenn Youngkin defeated Terry McAuliffe 
in the race for the governor’s mansion in 
Virginia. Jack Ciattarelli outperformed 
nearly everyone’s expectations in New 
Jersey, narrowly losing against Democratic 
Gov. Phil Murphy, who won a second term. 
Other, less nationally recognized elections 
illustrated the GOP’s current electoral 
strength. If the circumstances don’t change 
— for example, if President Biden doesn’t 
manage to stop the country’s inflationary 
trends — next year could be a bloodbath 
for Democrats. And even if Biden does, 
Republicans are still poised to win back the 
House and Senate, just by a smaller margin.

But 2022 is not 2024. Trump will not 

just make a short appearance as he does in 
“Home Alone 2” — he is a fantastic tool to 
make Republicans go out and vote for the 
candidates he endorses (except in Georgia), 
yet Democrats get energized when he’s the 
one on the ballot. And there is no doubt in my 
mind that he will run again and will become 
the nominee. 2024, regardless of where the 
country is politically — with Biden at a 30% 
or 60% approval rating, we don’t know — 
will be a close race. Closer than 2020. 

With that in mind, think of this: the 

“Home Alone 2” scenario in three years is 
Trump declaring that he won, even though 
Biden has been reelected by the skin of 
his teeth. Trump supporters blare out 
statements about election fraud. Republican 
legislative 
majorities 
in 
battleground 

states seek to overturn the results. This 
time, no one’s there to protect democracy. 
Democrats are entrenched. Republicans are 
entrenched. It’s a stretch to say that “Civil 
War” could begin, but violence would ensue. 
So how can this be avoided? 

For the time being, Biden needs to get 

moving. He has to become an LBJ-type 
figure who controls the Senate, and he needs 
to do so now. Implement the infrastructure 
bill. Continue working with moderates like 
Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan 
Collins, R-Maine; they’re the answer. 

Extol the bill’s bipartisan merits until 
November 2024. Curb inflation by hiking 
interest rates — a necessary evil — while 
publicizing the sinking unemployment 
levels. Support the police by following 
the Eric Adams model. Doing so means 
focusing on taming crime, which can be 
done by expanding the police force and 
training them adequately. Stop talking about 
taxing corporations and the rich. It may not 
be socialism, but it certainly sounds like it 
— and politics is all about communication 
and marketing. Instead, talk about tax cuts 
for the middle and lower classes. Laud the 
progress this administration has made 
on vaccines. Communicate openly about 
issues regarding immigrants and the 
southern border and don’t let situations like 
the whipping of a Haitian migrant occur. 
Finally, avoid blunders like the France-
Australia debacle.

In the long run — stop weakening 

democracy. That goes for both parties. 
Let’s not forget that Stacey Abrams, the 
Democratic candidate for Georgia governor 
in 2018, never conceded when she lost 
against Brian Kemp. Did she have valid 
reasons to speak out on election fraud? 
Maybe. Still, she should have conceded. 
Imagine how different the narrative would 
be — how different Jan. 6 would have been 
— if Trump had said that he believed some 
“sketchy” stuff happened (it didn’t), yet 
conceded anyway. Democracy wouldn’t 
have suffered as much. Neither happened, 
because neither party is currently willing 
to accept that they lost. Democrats spent 
four years throwing impeachments at the 
wall — even if only two formally reached 
the House — attempting to make one stick. 
It’s hypocritical for Democrats to assert that 
they’re the only party defending democracy 
when they’re also assaulting its processes. 
Trump was an awful president; he was not 
illegitimate. 

So let’s learn from “Home Alone 2.” Let’s 

not echo the errors made so far and replicate 
the 2020 incubus. We don’t need to be 
Kevin McCallister in New York. 2024 does 
not need to be a 2020 redux. And if you’re 
thinking that it’s too soon to be talking about 
this, as Christmas begins, it’s not. A year 
has already gone by; the situation hasn’t 
changed. Talk to your family this holiday 
season — especially those you never agree 
with — and find common ground. If you 
can, maybe the country can too. 

What can “Home Alone 2” teach us about 

2024? A lot, apparently.

On Sunday, the No. 2 Michigan football 

team learned its postseason fate: A trip to 
Miami to face No. 3 Georgia in the Orange 
Bowl. While the Bulldogs’ recent loss to 
Alabama toppled them from their long-held 
No. 1 spot, it’s hard to picture a National 
Championship game without them in it. 

But, as the Wolverines have said all 

season, they aren’t flinching. 

“We’re gonna be looking forward to it,” 

junior quarterback Cade McNamara said 
Sunday. “We know that it’ll be a challenge for 
us, and they have a good defense, but I think 
we’ve got a solid team ourselves. So I know 
that we’ll be confident, and I know we’re 
gonna be looking forward to it.”

While the team will take a short break 

to regroup before resuming practice, 
McNamara — known for his meticulous 
preparation — said he would start watching 
tapes later that afternoon. 

For much of the season, it looked like 

Georgia was in a league of its own. 

The Bulldogs have averaged close to 

200 yards on the ground and 250 yards 
through the air en route to a 12-1 record. 
They have a defense that’s held four teams 
to a touchdown or less and three more 
absolutely scoreless, giving up an average 
of 9.53 points per game. They opened the 
season by holding then-No. 3 Clemson to 
just a field goal and followed it up just under 
a month later with a 37-0 thrashing of then 
No. 8 Arkansas, performances that were 
good enough to snatch the No. 1 spot early 
in the season and hold it tight up until the 

conference championship week. 

But after Georgia’s blowout loss on 

Saturday, many in the Wolverines’ camp 
were hoping the dominant win against Iowa 
would be enough to propel Michigan to the 
top. 

“I thought we should have been No. 1,” 

senior edge Aidan Hutchinson said. “I mean, 
we just beat the number two team in the 
country and the number 13, but it is what it is. 
I mean, we’re in it. And we’re all so excited to 
play in Miami.”

While the seeming nonchalance could be 

hiding a greater sense of disappointment, it 
might just be genuine gratitude for how far 
the Wolverines have come. They started the 
season with mediocre expectations, many 
outside the facility anticipating a 7-5 ceiling 
for their season. Now, they’re the only team 
in history to make the College Football 

Playoff after starting the season unranked. 

Still, when asked whether there was any 

point in the season where they realized a 
Playoff berth could really be in their future, 
each player gave a similar response: 

“I never actually gave up on this team,” 

sophomore receiver Roman Wilson said. “I 
thought we could be one of the best teams 
in the nation. Even when I committed here, 
I still believed that. And I want to say I’m not 
surprised but really happy with what this 
team has done.”

Added graduate defensive back Brad 

Hawkins: “After the Michigan State loss, 
we all had a player-led meeting. We didn’t 
let that game define us. We continued to 
push. We continued to move on as a unit. 
The leadership in this building is amazing. 
We just kept hammering at it, kept grinding 
at it. We didn’t get satisfied. We continue to 

just grind it out. We knew that to come to this 
point we’d have to win out and we did that. 
We just continued to believe in each other, 
we stayed together. 

“And we got it done.”
Now, the Wolverines have a national 

semi-final clash with Georgia to show for it.

INDIANAPOLIS 
— 
A 
Big 

Ten Championship, a 17-year title 
drought and a chance at the College 
Football Playoff lay on the line 
Saturday. There was absolutely no 
need for extra motivation.

And yet, the shoulder of every 

Michigan football player, coach and 
staff member bore a patch: a block 
‘O,’ with the initials ‘TM’ and the 
number 42. It was to honor Tate 
Myre, a 16 year old high school 
student who played football and 
wrestled. A student that passed 
away in the shooting in his high 
school on Tuesday in Oxford, Mich.

After the tragedy, this game 

found far more meaning than 
championship hopes. It was about 
being there for a family in its time of 
need, and this team — like it has on 
the football field nearly every time 
this season — rose to the occasion 
during its title-clinching victory 
over No. 13 Iowa. 

“You know, it’s a community 

that needs all of our prayers, every 
one of them,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said. “And we just, we 
wanted to offer that up. We wanted 
to offer our prayers. They’re a 
community that desperately needs 
it and offer them up to the one who 
conquered death and also honor 
Tate Myre and his bravery, his 
courage.”

Besides just wearing the patch, 

the Myre family was also in 
Indianapolis and joined the team for 
the coin toss. 

So, with the biggest game of its 

season coming up, Michigan had 
its eyes focused on something else: 
the Myre family. And, as always, 
the Wolverines’ leader stepped into 
the foreground. Senior edge rusher 
Aidan Hutchinson, less than a week 
after making a Heisman Trophy 
statement game, thought the team 

needed to honor Tate. 

So he went to Harbaugh.
“And so, you know, when the 

players — when Aidan came to me — 
and wanted to dedicate this game to 
Tate Myre, (I said), ‘You know, yes, 
let’s do that,’ ” Harbaugh said. “Let’s 
do that. That was, that was huge.”

These Wolverines have never 

needed anyone to motivate them 
externally, but, as their repeated 
exclamations of ‘2%’ and ‘6-6’ came 

bursting out of the locker room 
on Saturday night showed, a little 
outside motivation couldn’t hurt. To 
play for a community in Michigan, 
in a team made up of leaders from 
Michigan, that dedication pushed 
the Wolverines to play as best they 
could. 

“We talked about it last night,” 

Harbaugh said. “What more, 
how much more can we pile into 
one game, the importance of one 
game.”

Graduate student center Andrew 

Vastardis added: “And on top of it, 
we wanted to play for 42, all those 
that tragically lost their lives in that 
community and everything.”

After 
beating 
Ohio 
State, 

Saturday’s game became about 
tempering 
emotions: 
Following 

such a high where Michigan finally 
threw the monster off its back, how 
would they respond and focus on 
the next game? Then, the tragedy 
in Oxford added even more to that 
emotional turbulence.

So, when Donovan Edwards 

dove over the top of a pile to score 
the Wolverines’ sixth touchdown 
of the game and Jake Moody hit his 
sixth extra-point down the middle 
of the uprights to make the score a 
42-3 statement, it meant more. 

“Goosebumps,” Hutchinson said.
“Chills,” Vastardis said. 
Now, instead of 42 just on the 

shoulders of Michigan to honor Tate 
Myre and Oxford, that number will 
be written into the history books.

Michigan looks forward to Georgia despite not receiving No. 1 ranking

SportsMonday: Don’t doubt Michigan anymore

On Dec. 31st, Michigan will play for 

everything. In a season that began full 
of doubt and low expectations, it beat 
Ohio State. It beat Wisconsin and Iowa. 
It’s 
overcome 

every obstacle and 
trial sent its way 
so far, including 
rebounding after 
its 
late 
game 

collapse 
against 

Michigan State.

On New Year’s 

Eve, in the College 
Football 
Playoff, 

the Wolverines will play Georgia. 
Alabama or Cincinnati await, should 
they win. 

And, after the past two weeks, 

Michigan could very well be the best 
team in the country. 

It’s certainly shown its weaknesses: 

Cade McNamara won’t blow your 
socks off, and its defense lets up yards to 
talented offenses. But the rest of those 
teams have weaknesses, too.

In its biggest test of the year, Georgia 

allowed 536 yards of offense, with 
421 through the air. Its previously 
unflappable defense showed glaring 
holes. Stetson Bennett IV can manage 
and lead the team to victory, but he 
struggled coming from behind. 

“General impressions are rugged,” 

Jim Harbaugh said of Georgia on 
Sunday. “It’s a rugged, tough, tough 
squad that plays extremely well on 
all sides of the ball and special teams. 
Gonna be really excited to dig into it and 
study them. But yeah, that’s the word 
that came to my mind.”

Alabama struggled against Auburn 

and at Texas A&M with a young Bryce 

Young looking overwhelmed and the 
offense looking stagnant. Perhaps after 
walloping Georgia, the Crimson Tide 
has found itself. Perhaps not.

Then there’s Cincinnati, which 

possesses the nation’s longest unbeaten 
streak. They’ve squashed nearly every 
team they’ve faced this season, including 
No. 5 Notre Dame, but the same 
questions have persisted throughout 
their season: What happens when they 
play an opponent like Alabama that’s 
incredibly talented?

Through 
the 
last 
14 
weeks, 

Michigan has established itself as 
the No. 2 team in the country, and 
there are few who would argue it. 
It’s outperformed every expectation 
that those outside the program have 
had for it, and on New Year’s Eve, the 
expectation is a loss. Georgia opened 
as a one-touchdown favorite, and very 
few outside the program would expect 
the Wolverines to win. 

But Michigan knows how good of a 

team it is.

“I think when we beat (Ohio State), 

we knew we can — we’re a really good 
football team — and we got a really 
good chance to win (the semifinal), 
because Ohio State was a really talented 
team,” senior defensive lineman Aidan 
Hutchinson said.

Michigan has the best rushing game 

of the remaining four teams, gaining 30 
more yards on the ground than the next 
best team in the playoff — the Bulldogs. 
It has the second-best 3rd-down 
conversion percentage, with 45.1%, and 
the second-best 3rd-down defense, with 
32.3%, both behind the Crimson Tide.

This year, where talent and coaching 

are even, it seems that what matters 

most is an identity and dedication. The 
Wolverines have mastered both over 
the course of the season. 

“Toughness is something that we 

take to heart and that we have made our 
identity,” Michigan quarterback Cade 
McNamara said. “And I really — I just 
love the identity that we’ve created, no 
matter what the style of football is at this 
day and age.”

The last two games, in its toughest 

stretch of the season, that identity 
has worn down opponents and led to 
second-half explosions. McNamara 
has been clinical, hitting his targets and 
making the plays he needs to. But above 
that, there’s the element that is perhaps 
most surprising: Michigan’s big plays.

Saturday’s double pass for 75 yards 

and Blake Corum’s run for 67 yards, 
are just the beginning of an offense 
that repeatedly gains large chunks of 
yards. The Wolverines totaled eight 
plays of 15-plus yards in the Big Ten 
Championship Game, breaking open 
a defense that is one of the best in the 
country. 

Michigan has been doubted week 

after week, including by me, but with 
just two weeks left, no one should doubt 
the Wolverines.

Because they may just win the 

National Championship.

points on Saturday, the jersey number 
Oxford student Tate Myre wore. 

BECCA MAHON/Daily 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh won his first Big 

Ten Championship a year after going 2-4.

Josh Gattis made a mad dash for the 

elevator. 

For the second straight week, the Michigan 

football team had done 
something that, a few 
months prior, seemed 
unthinkable. Even before 
the confetti fell from 
the 
rafters 
following 

the 
Wolverines’ 
42-3 

throttling of Iowa, Gattis 
and his analysts had 
begun 
their 
descent, 

anxious 
to 
join 
the 

celebration of the program’s first Big Ten 
Championship since 2004.

For Gattis individually, though, the win 

meant even more. His offense’s performance 
— a complete, 42-point dismantling of one 
of the nation’s top defenses statistically — 
represented the full realization of a vision that, 
in prior years, had failed to materialize.

It was abundantly clear: The efforts of 

Gattis, Jim Harbaugh and the entire offense 
had fully borne fruit.

“I think (it’s) just the commitment from 

both sources — coach Gattis and then us 
believing in him,” sophomore running back 
Blake Corum said.

That commitment has taken time. The 

program Gattis joined in 2019 — one that was 
entering its fifth season with Jim Harbaugh 
at the helm — ran an archaic, uninspiring 
offense that had visibly reached its ceiling. 
Gattis had the potential to fix that; he brought 
promises of modern schemes and a catchy 
“speed in space” slogan, a refreshing message 
for an offense that, up to that point, looked 
anything but modern.

In Gattis’ first two years, though, the 

offense lacked an identity. At times, it 
made little sense, featuring gimmicky two-
quarterback systems and wildcat packages 
that only helped it get in its own way. Soon, it 
became a question whether the same fate that 
doomed promising Michigan offenses of old 
— the “innovations” of Rich Rodriguez, of Pep 
Hamilton, of offensive coordinators dating 
back to the Wolverines’ last conference title — 
would come to meet Josh Gattis.

It didn’t. Where other coaches in 

Michigan’s past had doubled down on their 
failures, Gattis adapted. Instead of forcing 
his offense into a pass-first system with 
personnel not suited to it, he looked at the 
talent in his running backs room and on his 

offensive line and worked with Harbaugh to 
accentuate it.

“He committed to the run game early,” 

Corum said. “In the interview (prior to the 
season), he said last year he didn’t really focus 
on the run game. He’s been a tremendous play 
caller.”

Harbaugh, too, learned from Gattis. The 

head coach’s fingerprints are all over the 
Wolverines’ offense — they’re most visible 
in the old-fashioned power runs that have 
opened up space for the backs all season. 
But he’s also allowed Gattis’ own creativity 
to flourish. On Saturday, that was evident in 
Michigan’s multiple big plays, in the double 
pass for a touchdown from freshman running 
back Donovan Edwards, in the flea flicker 
that’s called basically every week and in the 
endless jet sweeps and end arounds that — yes 
— put speed in space.

The results are easy to see. The Wolverines 

have gone from tallying 381.3 yards per game 
last year to 451.9 this year. In both of their 
biggest two games of the season — against 
Ohio State last week and the Hawkeyes on 
Saturday — they’ve put up 42 points and over 
450 yards. From the eye-test standpoint, the 
offense is playing with as much confidence as 
any team in the country and having fun while 
doing it.

“Toughness is something that we take to 

heart and that we have made our identity,” 
junior quarterback Cade McNamara said. “I 
just love the identity that we’ve created, no 
matter what the style of football is at this day 
and age.”

Truthfully, the offense that Gattis and 

Harbaugh have crafted together has been a 
long time coming. When Gattis first arrived 
on campus, he struggled to live up to the 
expectations placed upon him to shape a 
championship-caliber system.

Now, with a Big Ten Championship under 

his belt and as a finalist for the Broyles Award 
— given to the nation’s top assistant coach 
every year — Gattis has proven that he belongs 
at Michigan. Through the speed bumps the 
program has hit along the way, both he and 
Harbaugh have managed to adapt and help 
build a true contender.

“We’ve really had the mentality of 

‘Michigan versus everybody,’ ” McNamara 
said. “I just don’t know much to say other than 
I love these dudes. Like, really.”

That mentality has lifted the Wolverines to 

new heights. Soon, we’ll see if they hit a ceiling.

Gattis, Harbaugh realize their vision

INDIANAPOLIS — There was a moment 

in Saturday’s game, deep in the fourth 
quarter once Michigan’s lead had swelled 
to 35-3, when Jim Harbaugh and Aidan 
Hutchinson flashed across the Lucas Oil 
Stadium big screen. 

The seventh-year Michigan coach and 

senior defensive end locked eyes. They 
screamed in each other’s face and whacked 
one another across the chest. And the crowd 
— delirious, jubilant and rollicking — roared 
in appreciation. 

Later in the night, with remnants of maize 

streamers and blue confetti still draped to 
their clothes, the pair convened again. They 
sat side-by-side and smile-by-smile as newly-
minted Big Ten champions. 

“For 
guys 
to 
live 
on, 
really, 
in 

Schembechler Hall forever, I mean, this 
picture is going to be up there on the All-
American wall,” Harbaugh said, grappling 
with the magnitude of the victory. “Every 
guy on the team in the team picture is going 
to be up there as part of a Big Ten champion. 
We’ve got a banner in Glick Fieldhouse that’s 

going to say Big Ten Champion.” 

Last week’s stunning performance against 

Ohio State thrust this iteration of Wolverines 
into the history books. But, as has been a 
common thread throughout this magical 
season, neither the players nor the coaches 
were satisfied. They wanted more. 

Now, after a 42-3 shellacking of Iowa, they 

have it. 

“We fully believed that at some point or 

another during our legacy something would 
happen, something would put Michigan back 
on top,” sixth-year center Andrew Vastardis 
said. “And I think every guy that’s come in 
here after I got here has just bought into 
that and done everything they can to make it 
happen.” 

Did Harbaugh ever think that this moment 

would come? 

“Nobody’s owed anything,” he said. 

“Nobody’s entitled to anything.” 

And Hutchinson? 
“That was obviously one of the goals going 

into the season, but there’s no guarantees in 
life, no guarantees that you’re going to win 
anything.” 

Harbaugh is well-versed in that lesson by 

now. He returned to his alma mater seven 
years but a lifetime ago, hailed as the savior 

destined to rescue a tradition-rich program 
from the abyss. He re-entered the college 
football sphere with flair, charisma and a 
brash confidence. 

Those blissful images were distant 

memories this time last year, when it seemed 
as if Harbaugh’s tenure was careening 
towards a rather unfulfilling end. The 
Wolverines were dysfunctional — at 2-4 and 
in the throes of a COVID-19 outbreak, they 
seemed direction-less. It was certainly a far 
cry from any restoration of glory days. 

Just look at the difference 12 months can 

make. 

As the seconds on the clock melted away 

Saturday night, a trio of Michigan coaches 
rumbled through the pressbox in search of 
the elevator; they fled the upstairs coaches’ 
box to join the pending celebration on the 
field. 

Offensive coordinator Josh Gattis hugged 

safeties 
coach 
Ron 
Bellamy; 
Bellamy 

returned the favor to graduate assistant Grant 
Newsome. They acted like a group of eager, 
wide-eyed kids, impatiently murmuring 
about the elevator’s status and debating 
whether the stairs would be faster. 

After the game, the scene unfolded 

similarly. Redshirt sophomore edge rusher 

David Ojabo stood at the entrance of the 
tunnel and took an endless stream of videos 
with fans. Those same fans informed junior 
quarterback Cade McNamara that they love 
him. 

And Athletic Director Warde Manuel — 

the man who offered Harbaugh a contract 
extension last January, entrusting the 
embattled coach with the program’s future — 
pumped his fist and offered a “Go Blue” while 
he exchanged a hug with sophomore safety 
R.J. Moten. 

Meanwhile, in the Michigan locker 

room, talk of “2%” and “6-6” abounded, 
both references to the meager odds that 
sportsbooks and pundits pegged for these 
Wolverines entering the season. 

“Sometimes, just some of the stuff that’s 

out there, you just take it and ride with it,” 
sixth-year center Andrew Vastardis smirked. 
“Fuel to the fire.” 

Twelve games and a Big Ten Championship 

later, Michigan certainly has. 

“We’ve gone under some scrutiny, we 

know that,” McNamara said. “And we’ve 
battled through. We’re just such a great 
group of guys who just care about each other. 
We’ve really had that mentality of ‘Michigan 
versus everybody.’ ”

This is a group that Harbaugh refers to as 

the “mighty men and women of Michigan 
football.” He recites the reasons for that 
moniker ad nauseum — their work ethic, 
their day-to-day approach, their affable 
personality, their togetherness. 

“I love this team,” Harbaugh gushed. 

“There’s no team I love more than this team.” 

That’s high praise coming from a noted 

football-lifer like Harbaugh. It’s also a 
sentiment that goes both ways. 

“One of the first things I thought of after 

we won was Coach Harbaugh,” McNamara, 
his eyes washed red from tears, said. “… After 
last season, it was so tough and not just for us 
players but for coach Harbaugh as well. 

“And we know that there’s not one person 

who cares about Michigan more than Coach 
Harbaugh. This team, we came together. We 
want to win for Coach Harbaugh, too. We’re 
just so happy that we were able to give him 
that joy because he deserves it.” 

Moments later, McNamara left the 

podium and ducked into the locker room, 
trophy in tow. Vastardis followed him, along 
with sophomore running back Blake Corum.

Out of sight, but certainly not out of mind. 

Harbaugh and his Wolverines, immortalized 
together.

Statement Sex Edition


Let’s unpack that: How and why we talk about sex in college

If you walk into my house after 11 p.m., know 

that you will be talked about when you leave. 

Every morning after a night out, my roommates 

and I follow the same sacred ritual: the debrief. 

All 12 of us — and any male guests who have 

dared to stay past 9 a.m. — squeeze together on the 
couch to recap the night before. Over cups of cof-
fee and pieces of dry toast, we rehash everything 
from who was talking to who at Rick’s to who got 
too drunk and had to go home early to which guys 
were being stand-offish. No one is spared. 

Each person in the circle goes around and has 

their own 15 minutes of fame to tell their version 
of the night, frequently ending in who they went 
home with, what they chatted about, how the sex 
was and whether they’d do it again. Everything is 
dramatized to the fullest extent. My house actually 
bought a karaoke machine to add to the fanfare.

An informal Q&A follows with questions rang-

ing from “Was there cuddling after?” to “Did 
you come?” We laugh at mishaps and awkward 
moments, talk about positions and scrutinize 
potential red flags. I rarely venture stories of my 
own, probably due to the fact that I have a boyfriend 
more than anything else. So, instead, I throw out 
questions and give unsolicited advice, half jealous 
of their random hookup stories and half grateful 
that I’m not in their position. 

Inevitably, someone’s story will outshine the 

others, like the time, not one, but two of my room-
mates brought boys home just to make them watch 
the entirety of “Lemonade Mouth” and then quick-
ly sent them packing. 

Of course, we have much more serious conversa-

tions about sex at other times of day — conversations 

about hookup culture and consent and safety — but 
there’s something so enthralling and even empow-
ering about talking about sex in a way that’s entirely 
carefree, light-hearted and non-judgmental. 

The morning recap is hardly a universal expe-

rience, but many female survey respondents and 
people who I interviewed (who will be referred to 
by fake names to protect their privacy) recounted 
similar experiences. 

“We all kind of wake up and slowly migrate into 

the living room one at a time, but eventually we all 
just kind of talk about how everyone’s night was,” 
LSA senior Sarah said. “Not just sex-related but like, 
‘I lost you here, where did you go? What did you do?’ ”

The first time my boyfriend sat in on the debrief, 

he was surprised how formal it was, like a “morn-
ing support group” he said. I’ve always assumed 
that’s because the morning recap is a gendered 
phenomenon, and to some extent, it is. 

When asked on The Daily’s 2021 Sex Survey, 

about 65% of male respondents said they either 
agree or strongly agree with the statement “I feel 
comfortable talking to my friends about sex.” In 
comparison, almost 80% of women said they agree 
or strongly agree with the same statement. 

Even if men are comfortable talking about sex, 

they do it at much lower rates than women. Eighty-
five percent of females said that they discuss sex 
with their friends “often” or “sometimes,” whereas 
the majority of men — 75% — said they discuss sex 
with their friends “sometimes,” “rarely” or “never.” 

There’s also a huge gap in terms of what we 

share. Over half of women said they share every-
thing or almost everything about their sexual 
encounters with their closest friends. Another 
third said it depends on the circumstances (which 
friends they’re talking to and who they had sex 
with) and only 15% said they rarely, if ever, share 
details with friends. 

On the other hand, two-thirds of men said they 

share little to no information with their friends. 
Many responded to the question saying “I don’t kiss 
and tell.” The other third either said they share a lot 
of details or are open to sharing details when asked 
by friends. 

Sarah shares virtually everything about her sex 

life with her friends. 

Still, our sexual experiences seem to be very 

similar. Men and women gave comparable descrip-
tions of their typical one night stand: meet someone 
at a bar, go home with them, have mediocre sex and 
never see each other again.

They also cited similar reasons for having sex, 

the top answers being pleasure, love and to feel 
wanted. So, if our experiences are so similar, why 
do we talk about sex so differently?

There’s the biological answer, that women are 

more socialized to communicate verbally than 
men. While men bond through activity, women 
tend to bond through sharing — a phenomenon 
particularly pertinent within heterosexual rela-
tionships. 

“Men are socialized to use language to assert a 

hierarchy and their place in a hierarchy,” Cynthia 
Gabriel, Women’s and Gender Studies professor, 
said. “So they have less practice using talk to establish 
intimacy and rapport, and so it makes sense that they 
would talk to their friends less often about it.”

LSA senior Lauren feels comfortable sharing vir-

tually everything about her sex life with her friends 
because she says they have nothing to hide from each 
other. She sees their morning recaps as a fun, com-
fortable space that may even bring them closer. 

But maybe it’s also a function of hookup culture. 

Some social circles (I’m looking at you, Greek life) 
set very different sexual expectations for men and 
women. While men are free, even encouraged, 
to sleep around, the same behavior for women is 
looked down upon. Obviously, this leads to very dif-
ferent sexual behavior.

As Marcus, a recent Michigan graduate, said, 

men spend their first few years of college “racking 
up as many bodies” as possible, while women rarely 
do the same. 

Marcus felt like his friends talked about sex less 

frequency as college went on, a facet he thinks of 
the diminishing novelty of sex for men. Most of 
his male friends came into college relatively sexu-
ally inexperienced, so when they started rushing a 
fraternity, were exposed to an entirely new culture.

He remembers late-night recaps from his fresh-

man year that bear a striking resemblance to my 
morning debriefs. But, once the novelty of sex was 
lost, the experiences became a bit more routine, and 
he found there wasn’t much to discuss. It wasn’t 
that sex got boring or was any less enjoyable, but 
sex was just sex.

“One thing that I noticed is that guys like gossip 

just as much as girls,” Marcus said. 

“I think it’s just that (sex) as a point of gossip is 

just not really as disclosed. I don’t really know. It’s 
definitely true that details are gone over, particu-
larly when things are new, when you’re a freshman, 
and the whole hookup culture and sex scene is just 
new. You’re just getting with all different types of 
girls and things like that. So you’re addressing, you 
know, ‘This girl was like this, that girl was like that.’ 
But, then when you get older, people don’t want to 
hear the same old, same old.” 

But, for women, there really is no “same old, 

same old.” Regardless of hookup culture, the 
physical act of sex for heterosexual women is more 
nuanced than it is for men, particularly because the 
vast majority of heterosexual encounters end when 
the man finishes. The orgasm gap, the idea that het-
erosexual men reach orgasm 40% more frequently 
than their heterosexual female partners, creates 
more variety in the female sexual experience.

I like to bring up my mom when talking to 

friends about sex. No, it isn’t a product of some sub-
scription to one of Freud’s incestual talking points 
— my tendency to mention her is actually empiri-
cally grounded: she is a professor who has taught 
about the history of sex for over 20 years. And my 
personal bias aside, I’d confidently say she is an 
expert in the field. 

Telling people what she does usually garners the 

same cautious, yet intrigued reactions. People ques-
tion, “Is that a thing?”, to which I usually answer 
yes and make a half-hearted joke about take-your-
kid-to-work day. Others wonder if it’s like “Sex 
Education” on Netflix, and the answer is a little, but 
the absence of British accents makes a bigger dif-
ference than one would suspect. By far though, the 
response I get most often is some variation of: “You 
must have had an interesting childhood!” 

Without pause, I will always reply, “to say the 

least.”

Despite being Jewish, my mom loved to decorate 

our Christmas tree — but only with her beloved felt 
vaginaments (vagina ornaments). And this type of 
demonstration was no seasonal project; exposing 
her children to elements of the body and sex was 
my mom’s year-round, 24/7 hobby.

One of my fondest memories of her avocation 

in action comes from a car ride to my fourth-grade 
field trip. The destination was to a nearby retried 
mission to explore the church-like structure origi-
nally established to expand Christianity to the 
Native peoples of California. Naturally, my mom 
objected to the trip alone for socio-political reasons. 
But, in an effort to be supportive of my excitement 
to go, she decided to enlighten me on the puritani-
cal origins of the sex position Missionary and its 
anti-Indigenous roots. 

Not to mention 

the one time I 
asked her who 
Thomas Jeffer-
son was. She 
felt the most 
important 
thing 
to 

know 
about 

him was not 
his 
presidency 

but that he was a 
rapist; specifically, that 
he serially abused 
enslaved 
woman 
Sally 

Hemings. She was adamant to explain how the 
prevailing narrative of them having a beautiful 
relationship is a historical inaccuracy. From there, 
she derived an impromptu lecture about the nature 
of consent and our culture trying to rename abuse 
as love. I was 10. 

These were not isolated incidents. By nature 

of her work on sex, rape, power and race, she was 
constantly uncovering the disgraceful histories 
behind many current day, seemingly innocuous 
social functions. I was 15 when her latest book, 
“Colonial Complexions,” was published. The book 
is dedicated to me and my brother and is focused on 
characterizations of the body. It reads “For Casey, 
For Ripley, May you each continue to embrace the 
amazing bodies that house you.”

Because I had been taking my mom’s courses 

since I could speak, there was no way my unsophis-
ticated, still rapidly developing brain could take on 
the weight of such hefty subjects. So, I resorted to 
adopting an emotionless perspective in order to 
manage the overwhelming feelings that held hands 
with this devastating reality of sex. I felt it was only 
feasible to anesthetize myself in order to process 
the intimidating facts I newly became aware of. 
I sustained this perspective throughout my very 
PG high school career. So, when I arrived at college 
with this intellectualization approach, I found the 
University of Michigan’s rampant hookup culture 
to be one of the strangest, most grotesque social 
phenomenons I had ever witnessed. 

From what I could tell from my, admittedly 

subjective, cis, heterosexual advantage point, it 
seemed that most women in similar standings to 
mine were losing out in hookup culture, yet still 
choosing to participate. I watched as my friends 
compromised their boundaries, safety, health 
and sanity. They explained that their pursuits 

were mostly motivated by a need for valida-
tion and human touch, which is completely 
understandable. But rarely did it seem like 
the extent of those benefits could ever mas-
ter the sacrifices required for them to 
occur. 

The women I knew became 

jaded beings just weeks after 
agreeing to participate in this 
culture. And those 

were 

the lucky ones — 

not everyone made it 

out whole. I would seethe 

with anger thinking about 

the things that have been done 

to the women I love. I still cry for 
them. I had painfully related to 
their sentiments of wanting to be 
cared for and was saddened by the 

means they felt necessary to achieve 

that. And the worst part of it all? No 
amount of cautionary tales could satisfy 
my own morbid curiosity. 

I am my mother’s daughter. Her love for intel-

lectual inquiry is hereditary, and we are at a top-
tier research institution, after all. I couldn’t help but 
do my own experiment to see if I could stay above 
water in hookup culture, regardless of knowing 
the success rate of my peers. So, I embarked on a 
self-directed case study to investigate and critically 
assess loosely promised benefits within hookup 
culture. 

The most classic experiment to run is of course 

a college situationship. Put in less than academic 
terms, this title exists to represent the grey area of a 
relationship where both participants operate under 
the assumption that sex will be the primary focus 
of the arrangement with no promise of exclusivity. 
In theory, this is not problematic — casual sex is not 
inherently destructive or wrong. But as I observed 
through others’ participation, respect can vary 
with the lending of bodies and it can be difficult to 
reject the feelings that arrive with physical intimacy. 
Methods for my field study go as follows:

My standards for the selection of a male par-

ticipant: way too low. The set up: a man invested for 
sex and a woman, me, invested for emotional ful-
fillment. The variable that seemed to stay constant: 
abysmal communication.

The first thing I gained in my preliminary 

research rang true: these dynamics are not sustain-
able because sex cannot be the currency of a rela-
tionship. Emotional and physical intimacy run on 
completely different metrics and bodies cannot be 
traded and borrowed without any emotional toll.

One time, following my co-participant’s and I’s 

usual exchange, I wanted to see how far I could 
push this anthropological research. We sat in his 
dorm room and I asked him if he respected me. He 
replied with honesty: “Probably not as much as you 
would like me to.” When I asked why, he respond-
ed: “It is hard to respect someone who doesn’t 
respect 
themselves.”

His 
twin-XL mattress became my 
very own pyre as he finished his 
sentence. He hugged me as I start-

ed to dissipate, my head hung over his 
shoulder, facing away — he did not 

have to bear witness to the casualties of 

his words. It was a poetic injustice that he 

never saw the hollowness my face assumed, 
a disposition wiped and vacant of all intel-
lectual capacity. 
He deduced that my mere participation in 

the situationship phenomenon was permission 
to mistreat me. My poor coping skills and desper-
ate need for validation were a green light for him 
to borrow my body. In that moment, because of 
my emotional vulnerability and a little internalized 
misogyny, I had taken his conclusions as academic 
fact — man had cracked the code once again. My 
maltreatment was my own fault. 

Empirically speaking though, I suspect that 

experts in the field, specifically and especially my 
own mom, would disagree with his theory. Walk-
ing home from his place, just like a little girl, I 
needed my mom’s wisdom. I returned to the dedi-
cation she wrote in hopes it would wake me from 
my comatose state. 

May you continue to embrace the amazing bod-

ies that house you.

I speculated what message she would have for 

when I do not embrace the amazing body that 
houses me. When I deprive it. When I pinch and 
appraise it in front of a full-body mirror. When I 
forgo all intellectual thought, forcing it to accom-
pany me in subservience. It has housed me as I 
have tormented it for the majority of my 18 years 
of life. What is someone to make of such a man-
handled body? 

I hypothesize that she would argue it is okay 

to imperfectly reside in a home. She would say my 
body still holds value and should be regarded with 
inalienable respect. She would tell me I deserve to 
be handled with care. And she would adamantly 
note that neglecting your own body is never per-
mission for others to abuse it in tandem. 

But why would I speculate? Why not just ask? 

Mother knows best, and experts know even bet-
ter. Yet I chose not to tell her what happened that 
day. I did not tell my mom about any of this, actu-
ally. Honestly, I would have rather relayed every 
grueling detail to a Sweetwaters barista before 
even mentioning to my mom the surface of my 
escapades. 

And my apprehension about telling her was not 

from fear of punishment. As I’m sure you can infer, 
she is very sex-positive. Besides, I’m a legal adult, 
and she never really bought into discipline anyway. 
Instead, I refused to share what happened because 
I knew, academically speaking, what was wrong. I 
could confidently synthesize with very little mar-
gin of error what my mother’s professional opinion 
would be. I know how she would correct him and 
console me. I could hear her scream all the way 
from California how ludicrous his logic was if you 
consider bodily autonomy and the logical fallacies 
of misogyny. 

But these were not intellectual endeavors, so 

they could not be governed by intellectual answers. 
I could have known every philosophical, sociologi-
cal, historically informed argument academia had 
to offer, and I still would have returned to his dorm 
again that night like I did, even in the wake of his 
dehumanizing comments. 

I arrived to him as a lost puppy who realized a 

locked kennel is warmer than the streets. I missed 
my owner and domesticated animals do not 
bother themselves with the trivialities of critical 
thought. 

After returning from my second visit, I 

decided to tell my friends what was happening. 
That way, at least the case study would be peer-
reviewed. As we debriefed the night’s detri-
ment, it became evident that my experience was 
relatable to too many of them. We attempted to 
reach for an empirical cure — all to assuage our 
fear that this might be a universal experience for 
women. We tried to find big words to assign to 
our feelings and organize our thoughts to make 
sense of the mess. We could have written disser-
tations on these topics.

And we do.

The female ORGASM on Prozac

W

e are chronically misinformed when it 
comes to female pleasure — where it hap-

pens, why it happens and how. At times, even the 
scientific and research communities are stumped 
on the evolutionary purpose behind the female 
orgasm: while some studies point at a procreating 
advantage prior to ovulating periods for women 
who orgasm, no firm claim can yet be made. 
Female orgasms, especially in contrast to male 
orgasms, are so often mystified that it becomes a 
rarity, or a surprise, when they do happen. 

As Linda Geddes wrote in a 2015 BBC article 

“The Mystery of the Female Orgasm,” “Pressed or 
caressed the right way, a woman can be transport-
ed to such ecstasy, that for a few seconds, the rest 
of the world ceases to exist. But get it wrong and 
pain, frustration, or dull nothingness can ensue. 
It’s a stark contrast to a man’s experience; so long 
as they can get an erection, a few minutes of vigor-
ous stimulation generally results in ejaculation.” 

Let’s break it down even further. Merriam 

Webster offers it plainly — the female orgasm is 
“the rapid pleasurable release of neuromuscu-
lar tensions at the height of sexual arousal that is 
usually accompanied by the ejaculation of semen 
in the male and by vaginal contractions in the 
female”. But do we require this for sexual satisfac-
tion? I wish Merriam Webster could also answer 
this. 

There is research that hints at more relational 

ideas behind women’s orgasms and their purpose 
in 21st-century relationships. American psycholo-
gist Diana Fleischman stated in her 2016 report 
“An Evolutionary Behaviorist Perspective on 
Orgasm” that, “We (humans) have evolved to use 
orgasm and sexual arousal to shape one another’s 
behavior, and orgasm serves as a signal to another 
person of devotion, vulnerability, and malleability, 
which is, in itself, reinforcing.”

Devotion? Archetypal college sex is anything 

but devoted. But Fleischmann is onto some-
thing when she describes orgasm as an enforcer 
of “adaptive behavioral ends.”We are, after all, 
encouraged to bookend hookups with orgasm. 
But is that really the point? Is it actually enjoyable? 
Who’s to say?

O

n any given campus, sexual experimenta-
tion runs rampant — it’s part of 
the 

college brand, à la “Animal House,” 
“Superbad” or “Neighbors”: out-
of-control parties, drunk 
destruction, sloppy sex. 
As a freshman, this was 
something you had to expe-
rience in order to feel like you 
were “doing it right.” 

My freshman year at the University 

of Michigan, I took a seminar called Soci-
ology of the Family. We covered everything 
from dating to divorce, parenthood to unpaid 
labor, gender roles to domestic work. One of our 
assigned readings was Lisa Wade’s “American 
Hookup: The New Culture of Sex on Campus.” 
The book dives into a history of sexuality, higher 
education and the risks and rewards of hookup 

culture — offering pointed insights as to where 
we’re headed. I’ll admit that I had initially fig-
ured this book to be another out-of-touch, flimsy 
report on how heartlessly our generation has 
come to regard sex and relationships. But it was 
surprisingly exact.Because Wade recruited actu-
al college students to give detailed and relatively 
anonymous reports of their sex lives, the book 
thrums with truth. 

Of the scarily accurate descriptions Wade 

offers, she elaborates on the party experience 
most precisely. Chapter 1 begins with a lurid 
description of two women getting ready in their 
dorm room: “The goal is to look ‘fuckable,’ Miran-
da said, her voice buzzing with excitement. She 
and her roommate Ruby were tearing through 
their tiny closets, collecting a pile of ‘provocative’ 
items to consider wearing to that night’s party. 
The theme was ‘burlesque,’ so they were going 
for a classy stripper vibe ... Miranda plumped her 
breasts and contemplated her outfit, a black crop 
top and a cherry red skirt with a zipper running 
down the front. She unzipped it a bit from the bot-
tom and, then, a bit more.”

Throughout the rest of the book, Wade covers 

everything from the history of hookups to frater-
nity culture to attractiveness hierarchies to sexual 
assault to relationship woes to female and male 
orgasms. Wade noted of orgasms, “In masturba-
tion, orgasms come easily and quickly to both 
sexes; on average, each requires just four efficient 
minutes to reach climax. Even women who never 
have orgasms with male partners often do regu-
larly when they’re alone.”

She continued, “If hookup culture has an 

orgasm gap—and it does—then the question isn’t 
what might be wrong with women’s bodies, but 
the extent to which the female orgasm is made a 
priority.”

It is through hookup cul-

ture that sex becomes rela-
tively lawless — and by 
lawless, I mean social-
ly lawless. Gone are 
the rules that require 
a least a few dates 
first, gone are the 
rules that you even 
have to know them 
before you step into the 
club, the bar, the 

party. Sex is 

read-

ily 
available 
and 
eas-

ily acces-

sible to most. For those who seek convenience, it 
is distinctly possible to download any number of 
apps in the morning, and by nighttime, have sex. 
Sex has, in this way, become cheap. 

I’m not moralizing here, or at least not inten-

tionally — but as I type this, Steve Lacy’s “N Side” 
seeps from my speakers and I’m wondering what 
the point of sex is. Is it to prove we are wanted, 
even if briefly? Is it, as Charles Bukowski might 
put it, “flesh searching for more than flesh?” Is it 
love? I don’t know, and I doubt I ever will. And I 
should probably stop reading Charles Bukowksi. 

***
A

dd on Prozac, or Zoloft, or Xanax, or Lexa-
pro or any of the other hundreds of drugs 

prescribed each year to American women aimed 
at combating depression and anxiety, and the 
female orgasm becomes that much trickier to 
untangle. Among the primary side effects of anti-
depressants is its impact on sexual function — one 
Harvard Health Publishing article summarized 
that these aforementioned drugs can “make it 
difficult to become aroused, sustain arousal, and 
reach orgasm.”

It is these articles and their statistics that swim 

around my head when I make the trek to CVS to 
pick up my Prozac refill. At the counter, I give my 
name, birthdate, repeat my last name and its spell-
ing, sign my name, shake my head no when asked 
if I have any questions about the medication, mar-
vel at the sheer length of the pharmacist’s nails as 
she hammers this information into the keyboard. 
I pay the $4 copay, she staples the standard-issue, 
five-page leaflet of warnings and potential side 
effects to my little brown bag, and I’m off. 

The literature of these advisory leaflets has 

always been absurdly entertaining: Remem-
ber that this drug has been prescribed to you 
because your doctor has judged that the benefit 
to you is greater than the risk of side effects. 

Curiously enough, all that is mentioned of 

side effects involving sex is: sexual prob-
lems. I suppose it’s all-encompassing! 

There’s an article in The 

Cut titled “Treating My 
Anxiety Made My Sex 

Life Worse”. In it, author 
Rae Nudson explained 
that of the reactions of her 

Lexapro prescription, “’sexu-
al side effects’ can refer to 

a wide variety of 

issues. 

It 

can 

mean 

low libi-

do, or it can 

mean 
problems with 

erections and lubrication, expe-

riencing less pleasure, or tak-

ing longer to orgasm than 

it used to. Sometimes it 

means that you still have the desire to have sex, 
but you don’t have the ability to orgasm at all.”

So then, how does sex change for women 

(and men) who can’t climax on their respective 
medication? What is sex without climax? What 
is climax? Merriam-Webster saves me yet again: 
English Language Learners Definition of climax 
(Entry 1 of 2) :

“the most intense point of sexual pleasure: 

ORGASM.”

The most intense point of sexual pleasure. So 

maybe orgasm doesn’t have to translate exactly 
to a “rapid pleasurable release of neuromuscu-
lar tensions at the height of sexual arousal that 
is usually accompanied by the ejaculation of 
semen in the male and by vaginal contractions in 
the female. Perhaps orgasm can be restructured 
to mean the very moment you are kissed, or the 
very moment you are kissed at that very place. 
The perfect position. I don’t know if I actually 
believe this, or if it’s just another thought experi-
ment told to play — but that’s why I employ the 
word perhaps. 

Restructuring our idea of sex so that there is 

less pressure put on climaxing can make sex more 
enjoyable, and for everyone. Enjoyable sex, most 
often, is sex with someone you are comfortable 
with, someone you care for. Hooking up, by con-
trast, is enjoyable in the way that a roller coaster 
ride is enjoyable — however thrilling, you will 
probably never go on that ride again, and you will 
also probably never again feel the exact thrill of 
riding it the first time. And it’s usually over in less 
than a few minutes.

Enjoyable sex is sex that understands that 

needs differ. Enjoyable sex is, to put it tritely, elec-
trifying. Your nerves fray. You feel that you can 
look into their eyes. There is, surely, pleasure. 

And pleasure, well pleasure is a good deal eas-

ier to achieve by virtue of its ambiguity. Pleasure 
can last for more than 30, or 40, seconds. Plea-
sure can live in you as long as you can remem-
ber it. Pleasure is tracing your fingers on the soft 
outline of somebody’s lips, especially if they are 
red from the cold of walking over to your house. 
Pleasure is meeting somebody’s line of sight and 
having the rare confidence to hold it. Pleasure 

is touching your pool-pruned hands to some-

body’s shoulders or raking through their 
brown-when-wet hair in the shower. Plea-
sure is kissing somebody’s ear because you 
know they love it when you do that. Plea-

sure is kissing somebody’s ear because you love 
to do that. Pleasure is bottles and tubes clanging 
over on the bathroom countertop because they 
were in the way. Pleasure is not finishing the 
movie. Pleasure is lifting up a pale violet dress, 
but just above the hips and just after everyone 
has gone to bed. Pleasure is the reliably warm 
nape of your neck, that perfect blue shirt. 

Pleasure is touch but it is also what comes 

before touch. Pleasure is patient. If you are a 
woman, or someone on antidepressants, and you 
find it difficult to enjoy what we are so often told 
we should be enjoying — I encourage you to think 
less about climaxing and more about pleasure.
