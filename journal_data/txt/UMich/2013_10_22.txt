UM-Flint has
* unique challenges
compared to A2
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
FLINT, Mich. - Just a
55-mile drive up US-23 from
Ann Arbor, the University's
Flint campus is by no means
geographically distant.
On the satellite campus,
streetlight banners display
the same Block 'M,' and in a
conference room at the Hard-
ing Mott University Center,
the same regents and execu-

tive officers crowded a long
table at the annual meeting at
the Flint campus on Friday to
discuss an array of University
proposals.
But in many ways, UM-
Flint faces very different
challenges than the Univer-
sity's flagship campus in Ann
Arbor.
In an interview Friday,
UM-Flint Chancellor Ruth
Person said recruiting and
enrolling students presents
the campus's greatest chal-
lenge.
"For institutions like this,
continuing to have a robust
enrollment in the future is
always going to be a chal-

lenge," Person said.
Person partly blamed
Michigan's decline on demo-
graphic shifts, as the popula-
tion ages and fewer families
with children move to the
state.
"You can see that curve of
high-school students going
down," Person said. "They're
gone, and they're not goingto
come back immediately."
But UM-Flint has coped
- and excelled - in creative
ways, as Jon Davidson, direc-
tor of admissions- for U-M
Flint, explained in a presen-
tation to the regents.
Undergraduate enroll-
ment has increased by 22.6

percent since 2007, according
to U-M Flint data. Current
undergraduate enrollment is
8,555 - a record high despite
a challenging recruitment
climate.
Davidson said enroll-
ment growth is a strategic
necessity. UM-Flint, like
the rest of the University,
has been forced to contend
with shrinking state fund-
ing. With the capacity for
more students, Davidson
said increased enrollment
provides further financial
resources via tuition dollars.
"Clearly Ann Arbor doesn't
have enrollment challenges,"

Faculty and staff
express concern about
competitiveness
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily Staff Reporter
The Senate Assembly convened
at Palmer Commons for a conversa-
tion with faculty and administrators
about proposed changes to retire-
ment benefit packages after data at
discussed the mostly private meet-
ing in early October was'made pub-.
lic.
These changes are one part of a
University initiative to cut spending
by $120 million that will be re-invest-
ed with the stated goal of making
tuition more affordable.
Laurita Thomas, executive vice
president of human resources and the
guest speaker at the meeting, said the
administration will be "as transpar-
ent as possible" with the faculty and
staff about the changes being consid-
ered and implemented.
Thomas explained that the Uni-
versity has guidelines in place to
ensure that any policy changes made
will continue to meet the standards

to which faculty and staff are accus-
tomed.
A main concern of the Senate
Assembly is that the University
remains competitive as an employer,
as benefits packages are often impor-
tant to potential employees,
Thomas also encouraged faculty
to subscribe to long-term disabil-
ity insurance coverage, which only a
third of faculty and staff at the meet-
ing said they currently have. She
noted that this would also help keep
the University competitive with other
top institutions.
Several faculty members used the
open discussion to express concern
about the effects policy changes will
have on them, including the lack of
a dependent tuition policy, which
allows faculty and their dependents
discounts on tuition after a period of
employment, which most comparable
institutions offer.
Though many seemed in favor of
the policy, Thomas was firmrthat the
policy isn't affordable and was never
on the table.
Others expressed concern that
making cuts to the health and
retirement programs would lessen
the University's credibility among

ANN ARBOR
A2 city council
asks pension'
board to divest

Members vote in
favor of removing
fossil fuels from
stock portfolio
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Monday's Ann Arbor City
Council meeting continued
the discussion on approv-
ing the addition of Ypsilanti
Township as a member of
the Ann Arbor Area Trans-
portation Authority and
finally reached a vote on
divestment from fossil fuel
industries.
A resolution asking the
pension board to was passed
Monday evening follow-
ing an amendment from
Councilmember Christo-
pher Taylor (D-Ward 3)
that softened the resolu-
tion language to "request"
action from the pension
board rather than "urge"
the board.
Arguments for and against
the resolution echoed those
voiced at previous meetings:
Those in favor are looking to
support the mostly symbolic
resolution, whereas those
opposed raised concerns of
the implications of actually
divesting.
LSA sophomore Laura
Hobbs, an organizer of the
Divest and Invest Campaign

on campus, said in an inter-
view Monday evening that
the passed resolution was a
success for the group - even
with the lighter wording.
"Ann Arbor really made
the decision tonight to join
a handful of other cities
nationally that have commit-
ted to divestment," Hobbs
said. "However it's worded,
I think taking that step is
great."
COUNCIL VOTES ON
ADDING YPSLIANTI
TOWNSHIP TO AAATA
The decision to add Ypsi-
lanti Township as a mem-
ber of the Ann Arbor Area
Transportation Authority
was postponed by an 8-3 vote
following a long discussion
between members of City
Council and Michael Ford,
the chief executive officer
for The Ride.
Ann Arbor Mayor John
Hieftje spoke in favor of
adding membership, saying
the seat is long overdue and
won't affect specific budget-
ary issues. Ford repeatedly
stressed to council members
that Ypsilanti Township has
met all the requirements laid
out in the past and the pro-
posal asked for including the
township only as an AAATA
member.

meeting, Ford, having spo-

Islamic militants suspected peace conference unlikely

Children among
those killed in
wedding day
celebration
CAIRO (AP) - The elderly,
silver-haired Christian could
hardly speak Monday, sitting
stunned in a church where
the evening before, susbected
Islamic militants on a motor-
cycle sprayed his family's
wedding party with automatic
weapons fire, killing his son,
his wife's sister and two grand-
daughters aged 8 and 12.
"It's God's will. They are
always beating us down. Every
other day now, they do this,"
the 75-year-old Fahmy Azer
Abboud said as he waited for
their funeral to start.
He spoke haltingly of his
dead granddaughters, both
named Mariam.

"They were pure angels.
They had the world's kindness
inside them. They helped me
and shared with me everything
they had," Abboud said.
The girls were waiting to
enter the Church of the Virgin
Mary in Cairo's Warraq district
for the wedding of another of
Abboud's granddaughters when
the gunmen struck about 9 p.m.
Sunday. The wounded included
seven relatives, with his other
son, Nabil, among them, he
said.
The shooting deepened
panic among Egypt's minority
Coptic Christians, already the
target of centuries of discrimi-
nation by the Muslim major-
ity. It also raised fears that an
insurgency by Islamic extrem-
ists in the strategic Sinai Penin-
sula and an increase in attacks
in rural areas maybe shifting to
the capital, a city of 18 million
people already beset by crime
and poverty.

The violence by Islamic radi-
cals has risen since the military
deposed President Moham-
med Morsi in July and cracked
down on his Muslim Brother-
hood and its allies. The attacks
have targeted mainly security
forces and Christians, whom
the Islamists blame because of
their strong support of Morsi's
ouster. In Sinai, suspected
jihadist fighters have stepped
up violence against soldiers and
police since the coup.
Sunday's shooting also
recalled an Islamic militant
insurgency in the 1980s and.
1990s, when extremists waged
a campaign against police,
Christians and foreign tourists,
trying to topple the govern-
ment of now-ousted autocrat
Hosni Mubarak. Many fear a
revival of that wave of violence.
High-profile attacks blamed
on militants have already
begun to creep into Cairo. In
September, the interior minis-

ter, who heads the police, sur-
vived an assassination attempt
by a suicide car bombing. Ear-
lier this month, militants fired
rocket-propelled grenades on
the nation's largest satellite
ground station, also in the capi-
tal.
8 9 5 6 Witnesses said a car blocked
traffic outside the Coptic
8 3 7 church minutes before the
shooting, allowing the gunmen
on the motorcycle the space

relatively easy getaway.

victims was attended by sev-
eral thousand Christians who
spelled into the street. Their
grief was mixed with anger and

"With our blood and souls,

chanted as the four coffins

the church.
Addressing the mourners,

said: "Even in these circum-
stances, we can only talkof the

Crisis continues
with more than
100,000 killed,
2-million displaced
BEIRUT (AP) - Syria's presi-
dent cast doubt Monday on
the chances of holding a long-
delayed international peace
conference to end the country's
civil war, saying the factors that
would help such talks succeed
do not currently exist.
The United States and Russia
have been trying for months to
convene a conference in Geneva
to negotiate a political solution
to a conflict that has killed more
than 100,000 people and forced
some 2 million more to flee the
country. The U.N. chief has set
mid-November as a target for
the proposed gathering, but
both Damascus and the opposi-
tion are skeptical and no final
date has been announced.
President Bashar Assad
brushed aside the renewed
efforts to coax the government
and its opponents to the negoti-
ating table, telling Lebanon's Al-
Mayadeen TV in an interview
that "the factors that would help
in holding it (the conference) are
not in place if we want it to suc-
ceed."
He said it's not clear who
would represent the opposition,
or what credibility the opposi-
tion's representatives would
have inside Syria.
"Who are the groups that will
participate? What is their rela-
tion with the Syrian people? Do
they represent the Syrian people
or they represent the country
that made them?" Assad asked,
alluding to his government's
claim that the rebels are agents
of Western and Arab powers.
"There are many questions
about the conference."
For its part, Syria's fractured
opposition has yet to decide
whether to attend the proposed
Geneva conference.
The main Western-backed

in Istanbul to decide whether
to take part in the talks. One
prominent faction within the
Coalition, the Syrian National
Council, has said it has no faith
in negotiations with Assad's
regime and won't participate in
any Geneva negotiations.
The ability of the Turkey-
based Coalition to speak for the
broader rebellion has long been in
dispute, and fighters inside Syria
- many of whom reject nego-
tiations with the regime - have
accused the opposition leaders in
exile of being out of touch with
reality on the ground. The Coali-
tion's already strained credibility
took a major hit last month when
nearly a dozen prominent rebel
groups publicly broke with the
opposition umbrella group. More
rebel brigades have since fol-
lowed suit.
Assad, meanwhile, has man-
aged in the past six months to
restore a sense of stability to his
government's hold on power,
shaken by losing large chunks
of the country to the rebels in
2012.
Dressed in a blue suit and
exuding confidence, Assad
used much of the interview to
denounce Saudi Arabia, Qatar
and Turkey for supporting the
rebellion against him. But he also
addressed the issue of his future
in the country and presidential
elections planned for 2014."
"I don't see any reason that
prevents me from running for
the next elections," he said. "It is
still early to talk about it. We can
only discuss it at the time when
the presidential elections date is
announced."
Much of the opposition says
no peaceful transition is possible
unless Assad leaves power.
The president also said that he
is willing to take part in peace
talks, but reiterated his previ-
ously stated position that he will
not negotiate with the armed
opposition unless they give up
their arms first.

stumbled repeatedly, while the
violence inside the country has
raged on, exacting a terrible toll
on the civilian population.
Residents of one besieged
rebel-held suburb of Damascus
issued an urgent plea Monday
for the international commu-
nity to save them.from starva-
tion and constant bombardment
after efforts to evacuate civil-
ians from the area collapsed this
week.
For months, government
troops have blocked food and
supplies from entering the sub-
urb of Moadamiyeh west of the
capital, activists say. Around
3,000 residents of the suburb
were able to flee the area late last
month during a rare, temporary
cease-fire.
Aid agencies say Syrians
across the country face diffi-
culties getting food, but hun-
ger in the rebel-held suburbs of
Damascus, largely surrounded
by government territory, is par-
ticularly acute.
In an open letter circulated
by the opposition's Coalition,
Moadamiyeh residents pleaded
with the international commu-
nity for help.
"Save us from death. Save us
from the hell of Assad's killing
machine," the letter said.
The Coalition called on inter-
national organizations to estab-
lish a humanitarian corridor
to allow food into the area. On
Saturday, the United Nation's
humanitarian chief Valerie
Amos called for an "immediate
pause" in clashes to allow civil-
ians to leave.
A spokesman for the Moad-
amiyeh council, Qusai Zakarya,
confirmed that local residents
had sent the letter to the Coali-
tion asking for help.
"We are heading toward a
definite destiny: starvation," he
said via Skype, with the clap of
shelling and the thumping of a
helicopter audible in the back-
ground.

New Jersey is the 14th state to

kills teacher,
wounds students
Police say a Nevada middle
school boy used a semi-automatic
handgun to wound two students
and kill a math teacher before
turning the weapon on himself.
The shooting occurred about 15
minutes before the opening bell
at Sparks Middle School on Mon-
day. The student's name wasn't
released, and his motive for the
shooting wasn't known.
Teacher Michael Landsberry
was being hailed as a hero for try-
ing to protect children from their
gun-wielding classmate outside
the school. Twenty to 30 horrified
students witnessed the shooting
as they returned to classes from a
weeklong fall break.
CANBERRA, Australia

Local Australian
parliament allows
gay-marriage
A provincial parliament on
Tuesday passed the first law
allowing same-sex marriage in
Australia, but it could be short-
lived with the federal government
threatening a court challenge.
The Australian Capital Territo-
ry parliament passed the law with
the support of lawmakers from
the province's governing Labor
and Greens parties. All eight
opposition Liberal Party law-
makers in the 17-seat Legislative
Assembly voted against the bill.
The first marriages could
take place in the national capital
Canberra in December, but fed-
eral Attorney General George
Brandis, a member of the Liberal
Party, said his government has
legal advice that the legislation is
invalid.
Australian Capital Territory
Chief Minister Katy Gallagher
refused a request from Brandis
to wait on allowing any same-sex
marriages until the High Court
ruled on the law's constitutional
validity.

Bus bombing sparks fear
about SochiOly-mpics

Suicide attack in
Russia adds to
security fears
MOSCOW (AP) - A female
suicide bomber blew herself up
on a city bus in southern Russia
on Monday, killing six people
and injuring about 30, officials
said. The attack in Volgograd
added to security fears ahead
of the Winter Olympics in
Sochi.
The suspected bomber was
from the North Caucasus,
a region in southern Russia
where an Islamic insurgency
has been simmering for more
than a decade following two
separatist wars in Chechnya. A
local official said the suspect-
ed attacker was married to an
Islamic militant.
Volgograd lies 650 kilome-
ters (400 miles) to the north-
east of the North Caucasus,
while Sochi sits to the west
along the Black Sea.
No one immediately claimed
responsibility for Monday's
suicide bombing, but it was the
first outside the North Cauca-
sus since Chechen rebel leader
Doku Umarov three months
ago called for a resumption of
attacks on civilians and urged
militants to target the Sochi
Games, which are to be held in
February.
Russia in past years has
seen a series of terror attacks
on buses, airplanes and other
forms of transportation, some

of them carried out by sui-
cide bombers. The last suicide
attack on a bus was in 2008.
Twin bombings on the Mos-
cow subway in March 2010
carried out by female suicide
bombers killed 40 people
and wounded more than 120.
In January 2011, a male sui-
cide bomber struck Moscow's
Domodedovo Airport, killing 37
people and injuring more than
180.
Umarov, who had claimed
responsibility for the 2010 and
2011 bombings, ordered a halt
to attacks on civilian targets
because of the mass street
protests against President
Vladimir Putin in the winter of
2011-12. He reversed that order
in July.
The suspected bomber was
from Dagestan, one of the pre-
dominantly Muslim repub-
lics in the North Caucasus,
said Vladimir Markin, the
spokesman for the Investiga-
tive Committee, Russia's main
investigative agency.
In a statement, he identi-
fied the suspect as 30-year-old
Naida Asiyalova. Russian state
television showed pictures of
Asiyalova's passport.
In Dagestan, the center
of the insurgency, bombings
and shootings occur almost
daily. Most of them target law
enforcement officers, not civil-
ians. The Tsarnaev brothers,
accused of carrying out the
Boston Marathon bombings,
have roots in Dagestan and
Chechnya.

Rasul Temirbekov, a spokes-
man for the Investigative Com-
mittee's branch in Dagestan,
said the suspected bomber was
married to an ethnic Russian,
Dmitry Sokolov, whom she had
met while both were university
students in Moscow.
She encouraged him to
become a rebel, and he quickly
gained a reputation as an expert
in explosives, Temirbekov said.
Sokolov, whose nom de guerre
is Abdul Jabbar, has been on
the run
Temirbekov said that the
suspected suicide bomber had a
fatal bone illness.
Video broadcast on state
tossiya television showed that
Monday's explosion occurred
as the bus was moving in the far
right lane of a divided six-lane
road. The video, taken from a
vehicle traveling behind the
bus, showed a burst of flame
and gray smoke. Fragments of
what appeared to be window
frames and other parts of the
bus were left scattered across
the road.
When the bus came to a stop,.
the video showed many passen-
gers jumping out.
Markin said seven people
died, including the suicide
bomber, and 33 asked for medi-
cal assistance, 28of whom were
hospitalized. Emergency offi-
cials said about 40 people were
on the bus.
The local government on
Monday placed security forces
in the Volgograd region on high
alert for 15 days.

After eight seasons,
Leyland moves on
from Detroit,
DETROIT (AP) - A picture
of Jim Leyland's face stared out
from the video board at an empty
Comerica Park, next to that
familiar Olde English "D" and a
message thatsaid simply: "Thank
You Jim."
After eight seasons manag-
ing the Tigers, including three
division titles and two Ameri-
can League pennants, Leyland
stepped down Monday. His voice
cracking at times, his hands
wiping away tears at others, he
announced his departure two
days after Detroit was eliminated
by Boston in the AL champion-
ship series. .
"It'sbeen a thrill," the 68-year-
old Leyland said during a news
conference at the ballpark. "I
came here to change talent to
team, and I think with the help of
this entire organization, I think
we've done that. We've won quite
a bit. I'm very grateful to have
been a small part of that."
Leyland made his managerial
debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates
in 1986, and from Barry Bonds to
Miguel Cabrera, he's managed
some of the sport's biggest stars
and been involved in some of
baseball's most memorable games
over the pastquarter-century.
In 1992, his Pirates lost Game 7
of the NLCS whenAtlantarallied
in the bottom of the ninth inning.
Five years later, Leyland won his
only World Series title as manag-
er when his Florida Marlins beat
Cleveland in an l-inning thriller
in Game 7.
He's experienced some of the
highest highs the game has to
offer, but also endured difficult
rebuilding periods in both Pitts-
burgh and Florida.
After one season with the
Colorado Rockies, Leyland
didn't manage at all from
2000-05 before Detroit hired
him. Leyland led the Tigers to
the World Series immediately
after taking over in 2006, los-
ing to St. Louis in five games.
The Tigers went to the World
Series again in 2012 but were
swept by San Francisco.
Leyland worked under one-
year contracts the last couple
of years, saying he was content
to wait until after the season to
address his status. He was reflec-
tive late this season, mentioning
to reporters that he had already
managed the Tigers longer than
he had expected they would keep
him, but he also said in Septem-
ber that he still loved the atmo-
sphere, the competition and his
team.
In fact, he'd actually told gen-

eral manager Dave Dombrowski
in early September that he didn't
want to return as manager. He
expects to remain with the orga-
nization in some capacity after
going 700-597 as Tigers manager.
"I'm not totally retiring today,
I'm just not going to be in the
dugout anymore," Leyland said.
"Ihope and pray that you give the
next manager the same respect
and the same chance that you
gave me."
Leyland says his health is fine,
butit's time to stop managing. He
said he started weighing his deci-
sion around June.
"I started thinking this was
getting a little rough. I thought
that the fuel was getting a little
low," Leyland said. "I knew that
I'd get through it because I knew
we'd be playing for something."
The Tigers figure to contend
again next year, which may lead
Dombrowski to look for a prov-
en commodity who can come in
and manage. Kirk Gibson, who
led Detroit to the 1984 World
Series title as a player, is now
managing in Arizona, but Dia-
mondbacks president Derrick
Hall tried to quash any specula-
tion that Gibson would return
to the Tigers.
"We would not grant permis-
sion (to the Tigers to talk to Gib-
son) if asked because we want
him here, and he told me this
morning he has no interest in
leaving," Hall said.
Detroit's players found out
about Leyland's departure after
Saturday night's game in Boston,
where the Red Sox won Game 6
to take the series.
"You've got your head down,
you lost and the season's over,
and then Jim dropped that bomb
on us," outfielder Torii Hunter
said. "I just had a feeling that it
could have been his last year. All
year, he was kind of emotional,
and Ijust felt it."
Leyland said there was no
announcement Saturday because
he wanted the focus to be on the
victorious Red Sox. However, he
was honest about how much this
defeat hurt.
"With all due respect to the
Boston Red Sox - who earned
it, they won it, they deserve to be
where they are - I truly believe
the Detroit Tigers should be
playing here tomorrow," Leyland
said. "This is one that's going to
stick with me, this is one that
really hurts, because I really felt
like we letcit get away."
When Leyland arrived at the
Tigers' spring training camp this
year, it marked 50 seasons since
he first showed up there as an
18-year-old prospect. His play-
ing career never amounted to
much, but his accomplishments
as a manager over more than two
decades have been impressive.

Thick smog persists in China,
highways and schools shut down

Pollution in China
reaches an all time
high, cause for
concern
BEIJING (AP) - Visibility
shrank to less than half a foot-
ball field and small-particle
pollution soared to a record 40
times higher than an interna-
tional safety standard in one
northern Chinese city as the
region entered its high-smog
season.
The manager for U.S. jazz
singer Patti Austin, meanwhile,
said the singer had canceled a
concert in Beijing because of
an asthma attack likely linked
to pollution.
Winter typically brings the
worst air pollution to northern
China because of a combina-
tion of weather conditions and
an increase in the burning of
coal for homes and municipal
heating systems, which usually
starts on a specific date.
For the large northern city
of Harbin, the city's heating
systems kicked in on Sun-
day, and on Monday visibility
there was less than 50 meters
(yards), according to state
media.
"I couldn't see anything out-
side the window of my apart-
ment, and I thought it was
snowing," Wu Kai, 33, a house-
wife and mother of a baby boy,
said in a telephone interview
from Harbin. "Then I realized
it wasn't snow. I have not seen
the sun for a long time."

She said her husband went to
work in a mask, that he could
barely see a few meters (yards)
ahead of him and that his usual
bus had stopped running.
"It's scary, too dangerous.
How could people drive or
walk on such a day?"
The density of fine particu-
late matter, PM2.5, used as an
indicator of air quality was
well above 600 micrograms per
cubic meter - including sever-
al readings of exactly 1,000 -
for several monitoring stations
in Harbin, according to figures
posted on the website of Chi-
na's environmental protection
agency.
They were the first known
readings of 1,000 since China
began releasing figures on
PM2.5 in January 2012, and it
was not immediately clear if
the devices used for monitor-
ing could give readings higher
than that.
A safe level under WHO
guidelines is 25 micrograms
per cubic meter.
Primary and middle schools
and some highways were
closed, said authorities in the
city, which is in China's north-
ernmost province bordering
Russia. At least 40 flights to
destinations in southern China
and Beijing among others were
canceled or postponed at Har-
bin's Taiping International Air-
port on Monday morning.
Austin's management team
said the 63-year-old singer
had been treated in a hospital
Friday morning for an asthma
attack in combination with a
respiratory infection.

She returned to her hotel
later Friday to rest, but was
unable to perform at her Bei-
jing concert scheduled for
Friday evening. Her Saturday
night concert in Shanghai went
ahead.
Her manager, Barry Orms,
said Monday that Austin, as an
asthma sufferer, would have
been "affected by the amount
of pollution."
He said that it wasn't their
goal to place blame, and that
"Patti has expressed our belief
that the Chinese government
can be a leader in this very
important issue."
On the morning ahead of her
concert Friday, Beijing's air
was visibly polluted, with the
city's environmental monitor-
ing center warning children,
the elderly and those with
respiratory illnesses to reduce
outdoor activity.
China's major cities have
some of the world's worst
smog. The government was
long indifferent to the environ-
ment as it pursued economic
development, but has begun
launching some anti-pollution
initiatives after mounting pub-
lic frustration.
Last month, China's Cabinet
released an action plan that
aims to make a small reduc-
tion in the country's heavy
reliance on coal to below 65
percent of total energy usage
by 2017.
According to Chinese gov-
ernment statistics, coal con-
sumption accounted- for 68.4
percent of total energy use in
2011.

Don't get testy
A bill to tie unemployment to drug testing goes too far
The Michigan state Senate approved a bill Thursday that would revoke
unemployment benefits for a person who fails a drug test (as a part
of the application process for public-sector jobs in Michigan). While
the bill wouldn't mandate that employers report applicants who either refuse
or fail a drug test during an application process, it proposes revoking ben-
efits for those reported as failing or refusing testing. This practice is further
burdening Michigan's unemployed residents and violates the privacy of those
who receive unemployment benefits.

The wind had begun to pick
up as my cousin and I made
our way across the five-
mile expanse
of the Macki-
naw Bridge this
past July. There
wasn't a cloud
in the sky as we
headed north,
the deep blue a
waters of Lake KATE
Michigan and LARAMIE
Huron churning
below us as we
drove.
The Great Lakes, carved and
shaped by the glacial retreat of the
last ice age, are the-second-largest -
polar ice caps are the first - source
of freshwater in the world. They
contain roughly 84 percent of North
America's fresh water and 21 per-
cent of the freshwater for the entire
planet. The Great Lakes Basin is an
ecological system like none other
on this earth, one characterized not
only by a unique environmental leg-
acy, but also by the human culture
that has formed around them: for
thousands of years.
Yet, as I drove across the bridge
that day in July, I wasn't think-
ing only about the complex his-
tory, beauty and legacy of the Great
Lakes: I was also thinking of the
lurking danger that lies beneath
them - an environmental disas-
ter in waiting, one often associated
with the catastrophic destruction of
aquatic ecosystems from the Gulf of
Mexico to the beaches of Alaska.
You probably already guessed
it: oil - hundreds of thousands of
gallons of oil. For instance, did you
know there's an oil pipeline that
runs under the Straits of Mackinaw?
I didn't, and the more digging I did,
the more fearful I became of the

dangers that this particular pipeline
poses to the Great Lakes.
The question is not if it will ever
rapture and spill heavy crude into
the lakes. It's when.
Before you call me a pessimist you
should understand a few things that
I didn't know until recently. The
pipeline under the straits is owned
and operated by a company called
Enbridge. Heard of them? On July
26, 2010, one of Enbridge's pipelines,
known as 6B, ruptured in Marshall,
Mich., spilling - on Enbridge's esti-
mate - 843,000 gallons of oil into
the Kalamazoo river. It was the larg-
est inland oil spill in the history of
the United States. Itis estimated that
Enbridge has yet to clean 180,000
gallons of oil that still remain in the
Kalamazoo River. The U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency esti-
mates that even after such a cleanup,
somewhere between 162,000 to
168,000 gallons of_
oil will remain in
the river, pollut- The ques
ing the water and
surrounding land. if the oil
Enbridge's line
under the Straits Will rap
is old, too, hid-
den beneath the rather
waves since 1952, -
five years before
the Mackinaw Bridge opened to
traffic in 1957. Now, I'm not sure if
you've ever been to the Great Lakes
or seen them in action, but they're
massive bodies of water that oper-
ate under intense force and pressure
from storm patterns, currents, and
freezing and thawing in the winter
and spring. All of these factors help
weaken and degrade such pipelines
over such a long amount of time.
Yet, despite the concern over
Enbridge as a company or the age
and integrity of the line, there's a

more urgent and pressing need to
call attention to the Straits Pipeline
now: Enbridge plans to expand the
pipeline's capacity, transporting a
great amount of crude beneath the
lakes in the form of tar sands oil -
some of the heaviest, dirtiest, dens-
est crude there is.
While tar sands has, until recent-
ly, beentreated like anyothertype of
oil that we transport through pipe-
lines across the United States, the
EPA has begun arguing that stan-
dards for tar sands oilltransportation
should be changed. Why? Because
it was tar sands oil that spilled into
the Kalamazoo River in 2010, and
the EPA has come to realize follow-
ing the disaster that cleaning up tar
sands is, well, almost impossible.
So on July 14, as my cousin and I
crossed the Mackinaw Bridge into
the Upper Peninsula, we headed
toward St. Ignace. We met up with

The lawmakers in Lansing who support
the bill do so on the basis that those who con-
sume illegal drugs are not suitable for work
and therefore don't deserve benefits from the
government. State Sen. Mark Jansen, a Repub-
lican, bluntly equated failing a drug test to
turning down suitable employment. In a state
House Commerce Committee testimonial,
Rep. Ken Goike, the bill's sponsor, argued "the
law currently states that in order to receive
unemployment benefits an individual must be
actively looking for and able to take suitable
work ... if you are not able to pass a drug test,
you are not suitable for work."
Other states have implemented similar
legislation with poor results. The Michigan
bill is similar to a 2011 Indiana law dealing
with drug testing and benefits. The Indi-
ana law allows for secondary testing should
the applicant fail the initial drug test; the
Michigan bill replaced this option with an
appeals process. Those who fail the drug test
could potentially be forced to release medical
records during an appeals process to defend a
positive drug test, which would further vio-
late their privacy rights.
A total of 29 states have proposed or enacted
drug-testing legislation, including Utah, Ari-
zona and Florida. These states' policies were

enacted to save the state money by revoking
benefits from those rule-breakers. Utah imple-
mented its law in 2012, and, in the first year,
spent $30,000 enforcing it only to find that 2.6
percent tested positive - well below the 8.9
percent estimated to use illicit drugs. In 2009,
Arizona enacted its drug-testing bill, claiming
it would save $1.7 million per year, but only one
person tested positive for drug abuse and the
state saved a mere $560. Florida's testingpolicy
was short lived and had similarly poor results
- only 2.6 percent of those tested failed, and
the tests actually cost the state $45,780.
Despite the presumption that the unem-
ployed are likely drug users, these results show
that residents receiving benefits from the gov-
ernment are not necessarily more prone to
illegal drug use. Additionally, precedent shows
that Michigan is not poised to save any money
by implementingthe bill.
Applicants who fail drug tests because of a
false positive could be kicked off of unemploy-
ment benefits before obtaining a job. This not
a constructive or admirable way of conserv-
ing state and federal benefits, nor is it helping
vulnerable populations. The state House of
Representatives should table this legislation
and focus on promoting recovery by uplifting
residents, not penalizing them.

Discriminatory blood policy

JOHN D'AMOS, MEG SCRIBNER AND DANIEL MORALES
Work left undone

This month we celebrate the two-year
anniversary of the Coalition for Tuition
Equality and reflect upon all that we have
accomplished. Two years ago, student leaders
recognized an injustice at the University of
Michigan in its policies toward undocument-
ed students. Consequently, student organiza-
tions from across campus came together to
fight for a more accessible and representative
University, demanding changes in University
policy and campus culture. At the heart of this
goal was achieving tuition equality - reform-
ing University tuition policy to allow undocu-
mented Michigan students to pay in-state
tuition. And, finally; in July, we made history
when the Board of Regents, responding to the
voices of the University community, voted to
extend in-state tuition to undocumented stu-
dents who attend three years of and graduate
from high school after two years of middle
school in Michigan.
With the passage of tuition equality, the
University of Michigan has spearheaded a
statewide movement. One week after the Uni-
versity, Washtenaw Community College passed
its own version of tuition equality. Less than a
month ago, the Wayne State University Board
of Governors made the incredible step of pass-
ing tuition equality as well. These bold actions
have opened doors to a college education for
undocumented students across the state.
With our successes and the successes of
other campuses, it may seem to many that our
work is finally done. However, while it's true
that the University has made considerable
progress since our founding, such an assump-
tion speaks to the lack of understanding and
acceptance that undocumented students still
face. This leads us to our continued mission
for the year: to work with the administration
and the community to raise awareness of the
University's new policies, secure financial aid
for undocumented students and create a more
welcoming campus environment.
While the passage of tuition equality has
become common knowledge on campus, the
community to which this issue is most impor-
tant remains less informed. We look forward
to working with undocumented communi-
ties throughout Southeast Michigan to raise
awareness of the new guidelines and encour-
age undocumented students to apply to the
University of Michigan. Furthermore, our

support will not end with awareness: We're
committed to helping undocumented stu-
dents navigate the application process, rec-
ognizing the complications that a lack of
documentation can present.
However, undocumented students' chal-
lenges don't end with the application process.
Tuition remains unequal, as undocumented
students still must pay more than their peers.
Unable to qualify for federal loans, undocu-
mented students must pay out-of-pocket or
rely on the scarce private aid that is avail-
able to them. With an average household
income of $36,000 per year, the in-state cost
of attendance of $26,240 remains out of reach
for most undocumented students who lack
financial assistance. It's an obligation of the
University to meet the demonstrated finan-
cial need of undocumented students. With
an upcoming capital campaign and recent
record-breaking donations, we'll work to
urge the University to direct funds towards
the students who need it most.
Undocumented immigrants face constant
discrimination and marginalization through-
out the country. With a history of such treat-
ment at the University of Michigan, to many,
our campus reprepents yet another oppressive
environment. We're dedicated to changing
this climate, and that process begins with the
administration. The University has a respon-
sibility to ensure that undocumented students
are treated no differently than their peers. This
requires employee training, safe spaces on cam-
pus, the provision of student legal services arid
psychological services, and access to University
Health Services. It's our responsibility to raise
the consciousness of undocumented students'
unique needs on campus and ensure that the
administration recognizes them.
We're proud to have accomplished so much
in our two-year history. That we have come
so far is a testament to the power of student
voices and the compelling nature of this cause.
However, our work is far from over. The new
guidelines for qualifying for in-state tuition
take effect in January. Thus, it's with great
urgency that we call on the University to work
with us in removing these additional barriers
to undocumented students.

Under the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's current policies
that govern blood donation, any
male who has had sexual contact
with another male - also referred
to as MSM - since 1977 is perma-
nently banned from donating blood.
While the intention of this catego-
rization is to identify risky behav-
ior, the reality is that the policy is
discriminatory and inadequate.
While the. MSM population has
been linked to higher prevalence of
diseases such as HIV, the current
health questionnaire singles out
this issue while failing to address
other riskier behaviors among indi-
viduals of all sexual orientations,
such as unprotected sex and having
multiple sexual partners. Discrimi-
nation against the MSM popula-
tion is a social injustice that can be
addressed in safe, effective ways.
Current policies target and discrim-
inate against a number of donors in
the gay and bisexual community,
while still allowing a number of
high-risk individuals to donate.
The Chinese Ministry of Health
has lifted a ban on lesbian blood
donation that also allows celibate
gay men to donate. Canada has
adopted a five-year deferral fol-
lowing any sexual contact between
two men, and the United Kingdom,
Sweden, Japan and Australia have
adopted one-year deferrals fol-
lowing homosexual intercourse
to align with deferrals for other
risky behaviors. Although these are
moves in the right direction, these
changes still address the donor's
sexual orientation.
The American Association of
Blood Banks and America's Blood
Centers have concluded that the

lifetime deferral of MSM is "medi-
cally and scientifically unwarrant-
ed." They support a change to the
current policy that would reduce
the deferral period to one year, har-
monizing with the deferral period
for other high-risk sexual behaviors.
The American Medical Association
additionally opposes the lifetime
ban on blood donation, concluding
that existing data and models sup-
port change to a reduced deferral
policy.
Blood Drives United, the Univer-
sity of Michigan student organi-
zation that runs the annual Blood
Battle competition against Ohio
State University, is launching an
initiative to petition the Food and
Drug Administration to reevaluate
and improve this outdated policy.
The proposed policy change seeks
to include newly eligible, safe-
donor populations while reinforc-
ing the safety of the blood supply
via the alteration of the question
addressing MSM to, "Have you had
unprotected sexual contact with
a new sexual partner in the past
12 weeks?" An affirmative answer
would result in a scientifically rea-
soned 12-week deferral, based on
the HIV-window period where an
HIV-afflicted individual can trans-
mit HIV without testing positive
for the virus. However, this deferral
could be extended to a maximum
of one year for consistency with
other behaviorally based deferral
periods. This proposed question
eliminates reference to and dis-
crimination against sexual orien-
tation and strengthens restrictions
on risky behaviors of all popula-
tions that are presently overlooked.
With the advent of existing,

improved biological testing along-
side the implementation of ratio-
nally based questions, policy change
can help save lives, secure the safe-
ty of the blood supply and create
greater equality amongst donors.
Regardless of sexual orientation,
an individual should be allowed to
donate blood if they otherwise pass
all of the FDA's eligibility require-
ments, including, but not limited to,
a disease-free status.
Join us during Blood Battle for
the initiative "Bleeding for Equal-
ity," whether to donate blood to
beat Ohio State University or to help
address this policy. Helping out with
our sponsor drives, which, at both
the University and OSU, will pro-
vide the opportunity for presently
ineligible individuals to recruit oth-
ers to donate on their behalf, visu-
ally demonstrating that we could
potentially have two times as many
donors. We will collect information
on how many people affected by this
policy could be potential donors and
present the information, along with
our petition, to the FDA following
the competition.
Sign our petition, which will be
available at all blood drives, vari-
ous campus events and online via
the White House's "We the People"
forum fromNov. 3 to Dec. 3.We must
collect 100,000 signatures within
those 30 days, so please inform oth-

CAMPUS
From Page 1
Person said. "They have more
applicants than they can pos-
sibly- deal with, but lots of other
institutions more like UM-Flint
and UM-Dearborn probably have
similar kinds of challenges."
As a commuter campus tra-
ditionally relying on Genesee
County residents, UM-Flint is
working to expand its enroll-
ment of international students,
first-time students and military
* veterans.
- To recruit those students,
UM-Flint has been reshaping its
identity over the past five years to
capture a larger demographic. In
2008, UM-Flint opened its first
residence hall after five decades
as a commuter campus.
Donna Fry, an associate dean
in the UM-Flint School of Health
Professions and Studies, said the
campus is still grappling with its
character.
"We're still trying to define
ourselves more clearly, and
becoming a residential in addi-
tion to a commuter campus is
part of that definition," Fry said.
"I think we need to define how
far we're going to go in terms of
the residential part of our cam-
pus."
UM-Flint's growth has also
been spurred by recent glimmers
of renewal in the economically
distressed city. The city of Flint
has operated under a series of
four emergency financial man-
agers since December 2011, all
appointed by Michigan Gov. Rick
Snyder. I
"This growth has been a result
of the transformation of both
the campus and the downtown
area," Davidson, the admissions
director, said. "Flint has received
quite a lot of revitalization in the
last few years, and that has con-
tributed to a much more inviting
environment."
UM-Flint's role in the future

of the city seems equally as deci-
sive.
When the University opened
a satellite institution in Flint in
1956, the city's assembly lines
were still humming. Business for
General Motors - the automo-
bile company founded in Flint
in 1904 - was booming. Brand
new Buicks rolled out of plants in
Northeast Flint bound for desti-
nations across the United States.
But as companies shuttered
their factories in the second half
of the 20th century, urban decay,
unemployment and crime packed
a heavy punch. At its peak, Gen-
eral Motors employed more than
80,000 blue- and white-collar
workers in the city during the
1970s. Today, the company has
fewer than 8,000 employees
across all of its Flint operations.
The population has also fallen
from 196,940 citizens in 1960 to
100,515 today. In 2012, Forbes
rated Flint as the most dangerous
city in the United States.
Despite initially bleak pros-
pects, downtown is beginning to
find its footing. Spurred in part
by UM-Flint's recent growth, the
city is mounting a comeback.
"If you came into town and
you drove around, you could see
we are an anchor tenant in the
city of Flint," Person said. "This
campus has a huge footprint in
the middle of the city. We are an
economic driver."
Mark Hoffman, owner of
Hoffman's Deco Deli on Garland
Street, said Flint's downtown
has changed dramatically over
the past few years. He correlates
Flint's revitalization with the
UM-Flint's move towards a resi-
dential campus.
Hoffman, who has been
in business for five years, has
noticed big impacts on the local
economy since UM-Flint intro-
duced student housing in 2008.
Students and faculty are frequent
customers at the deli, located a
few blocks from campus.
"UM-Flint has been a big part

of helping Flint regain its popu-
larity," Hoffman said. "Every-
body around here welcomes
the University with open arms
because they know it will impact
their business and stimulate oth-
ers."
Hoffman, one of UM-Flint's
approved caterers, said the Uni-
versity strives to work with local
businesses as well.
"As long as they keep doing
what they're doing, in five years,
Flint could be another Ann
Arbor," he said.
Fry, the associate health dean,
said the school also works with
the city to collaborate on stra-
tegic planning for Flint's future
development. She added that the
next chancellor will play a large
role in determining the extent of
UM-Flint's future connections to
the city. Person will step down
from her role as chancellor in
August 2014 - one month after
University President Mary Sue
Coleman finishes her term as the
leader of the University system.
A search for a new chancellor is
already underway.
"Over the years we've had
more or less of that," Fry said.
"And right now, we really need
more."
At Friday's meeting of the
Board of Regents, UM-Flint stu-
dents also asked for more support
from the Uniyersity administra-
tors in Ann Arbor.
During the public comments
segment, three students read
speeches berating regents and
administrators for their failure to
address student concerns on the
Flint campus.
"You have denied us a voice
by failing to provide students
with adequate representation in
the decision making process on
campus," UM-Flint student Sha-
quille Greene, the campus's Black
Student Union president, said in
a speech.
A group of about a dozen stu-
dents stood up and read parts of
the speech in unison.

The students expressed dis-
content with the board's decision
not to meet in Flint next year.
Instead, the regents will hold
their October 2014 meeting in
Grand Rapids, Mich.
"If you feel you can best do
those jobs from Ann Arbor, so be
it," Greene said. "But the tradeoff
has to be that you institute and
support sustainable systems to
address problems on our campus
in your absence."
Flint student government
president Amir Baz echoed simi-
lar sentiments during his report
to the regents.
At presidential search forums
in Dearborn and Flint, attendees
also emphasized the need for the
next president to improve con-
nections between Ann Arbor and
the University's satellite cam-
puses.
Fry pointed out that neither
UM-Flint nor UM-Dearborn is
represented on the Presidential
Search Advisory Committee.
"Sometimes UM-Flint and
UM-Dearborn are kind of
dropped off the radar, and so it's
a matter of keeping on the radar,"
Fry said.
However, Fry pointed out the
satellite campuses benefit from
many symbiotic relationships
such as internship opportunities
and graduate school recruitment.
Fry and Person, who gradu-
ated from the University in Ann
Arbor, said forging relationships
with Ann Arbor administrators
and faculty is also crucial.
"It's just a constant need for
us to try to keep a voice presence
with the regents and the Ann
Arbor campus," Fry said.
And as UM-Flint pushes into
its sixth decade, it will likely con-
tinue to mold its identity within
the University of Michigan sys-
tem and the city of Flint.
"When we say challenges, I
look at those as opportunities,"
Fry said: "Because there are a
lot of good things happening on
campus."

COUNCIL

bers before Monday night, said
he was surprised by the post-

sion the proposal was generally
supported.
"I think there was a lot of good
information provided ahead of
time," Ford said. "We've been
here before: We went through
a county-wide process, we shift
directions, they asked us to move
us this process forward, we bring
it back and itget delays a little bit
more."
Several council members,
including Marcia Higgins (D-

Ward 4), Sumi Kailasapathy
(D-Ward 1) and Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2), among others, said
while they would likely sup-
port the proposal, many of
their questions have yet to be
answered because Ann Arbor
residents haven't yet had the
opportunity to be involved.
"I want to be able to hear them
fully support it, and knowing
that my constituents have had
every opportunity to have their
questions answered," said Sally

Attorneys for
gunman say he
was coerced

Ex-Carnegie trustee on trialin Texas

Aurora shooter's
lawyers say police
misled him into
talking about bombs
CENTENNIAL, Colo. (AP)
- Attorneys for Colorado the-
ater shooting defendant James
Holmes argued Monday that
police coerced and misled him
into talking to them about bombs
that were found in his apartment
after the shootings, and they said
his statements shouldn't be used
against him.
Prosecutors scoffed at the
claim and said police had to ask
Holmes about the bombs because
they were a threat to human life.
Prosecutors and the defense
are debating what evidence can
be used against Holmes when he
goes on trial next year on charges
of killing12 people and injuring 70
in the July 2012 attack. Prosecu-
tors are seeking the death penalty.
Holmes pleaded -not guilty by
reason of insanity, and during pre-
trial hearings this month, the two
sides are grappling over evidence
that could be used to undermine
the insanity claim.
That includes statements
Holmes made to police when
they questioned him about the
explosives in his apartment.
Law enforcement officers have
testified they found intricately
planned bombs meant to divert
police from the theater while the
shootings were going on. None of
the bombs exploded.
Prosecutors could use that
alleged diversionary tactic to
argue Holmes knew the theater
attack was a crime - a blow to the
insanity defense, which requires
a defendant be unable to distin-
guish between right and wrong.
Holmes was questioned about

the bombs before he was allowed
to speak with an attorney, even
though police have acknowledged
he had asked approximately 13
hours earlier to see a lawyer.
Defense attorney Kristen Nel-
son said Thursday that Holmes
felt pressured to talk to police
because he was held "in a room
where he was cut off from the rest
of the world," and because the
officers implied they wanted to
know about the bombs to protect
people's lives, not to build a case
against him.
Nelson also said Holmes was
displaying signs of mental illness,
playing with evidence bags, fidg-
eting or suddenly sitting stone-
still.
Police should have allowed a
lawyer to be present "to protect
this mentally ill man from being
the instrument of his own convic-
tion and execution," she said.
Prosecutor Rich Orman said
court precedents allowed police
to question Holmes without an
attorney present because of the
threat the bombs posed..
"It is the-functional equivalent
of a gun to their heads. A bomb
that is goingto go off in the city of
Aurora," Orman said.
Attorneys are also arguingover
evidence from Holmes' apart-
ment, car, phone and computers,
as well as telephone and banking
records. The judge hasn't said
when he will rule.
Even if much of the evidence is
thrown out, prosecutors still have
a strong case, because defense
attorneys have acknowledged
Holmes was the shooter.
However, losing the evidence
would make it harder for pros-
ecutors to persuade jurors that
Holmes was sane. If jurors find he
was insane, Holmes could not be
executed but would be commit-
ted indefinitely to the state mental
hospital.

Texas prosecutor
accuses man of
laundering $500M
EL PASO, Texas (AP) - An
ex-Carnegie Mellon University
trustee was accused Monday
by a Texas federal prosecutor
of conspiring with a romantic
interest to launder half a billion
dollars for a Mexican drug car-
tel.
Marco Antonio Delgado is
being tried in El Paso on money
laundering charges.
Prosecutor Debra Kanof said
in her opening statement that
Delgado discussed a deal with
Lilian De La Concha, an ex-wife
of former Mexican President
Vicente Fox, at a meeting in
Mexico City.
"They talked about $600 mil-
lion and agreed he would get 5
percent of whatever he could
launder," Kanof said.
Delgado's attorney, Ray Velar-
de, says the meetings with De La
Concha were about his expertise
in energy and international law,
not drug money..
"At no time the subject of drug
money was mentioned," Velarde
said.
Delgado is a lawyer and for-
mer Carnegie Mellon trustee
who gave a $250,000 endow-

ment for a scholarship named
after him to assist Hispanic stu-
dents.
Prosecutors say Delgado con-
spired to launder drug profits
from July 2007 through Decem-
ber 2008. They say he's since
participated in financial trans-
actions they believe are connect-
ed to organized crime.
The investigation into Del-
gado started in September 2007
after authorities seized $1 mil-
lion in Atlanta. Victor Pimen-
tel, the man carrying the money,
told investigators that he, Del-
gado and other men had met in
Mexico and agreed to transport
money for the Milenio Cartel, a
drug-trafficking organization
based in the Mexican state of
Colima and associated with the
Sinaloa Cartel. Mexican gov-
ernment information states the
cartel was mostly disbanded in
2010.
Pimentel, now a key witness
for the prosecution, testified
Monday and produced several
email conversations spanning,
over several months between
him and Delgado. Some of those
conversations contained emails
that he claims were from De
La Concha to Delgado and that
were later forwarded to him by
Delgado.
Pimentel walked Kanof
through the coded language

that he, Delgado and De La
Concha prosecutors say they
used to talk about the money
laundering operation they were
allegedly negotiating with the
drug cartel.
In one email written in
Spanish, De La Concha tells
Delgado "Dear, in relation to
the Girls Scdut cookies that
you are going to try to place,
God willing you can help them
place five more boxes per
school each week. Right now,
instead of 300 they have in the
warehouse 500 boxes and with
the donations that are com-
ing in the amount is going to
increase."
Pimentel told Kanof that
each box of cookies meant $1
million, "schools" were bank
accounts or other geographic
locations and the "donations"
referred to drug proceeds.
In other emails, they talked
about constructors, iron works
and other words to refer to the
deal.
"We are not idiots, we never
dealt with cookies or iron
works. We only had one busi-
ness with these people," Pimen-
tel told the prosecutor.
In another email, Piientel
explained, Delgado forwarded a
letter that De La Concha would
send to Francisco Ramirez
Acuna, then interior secretary,

asking him to hire Delgado as
a lobbyist or representative in
Washington in order to better
the official's image in the U.S.
capital. Pimentel also said that
she requested that Pimentel's
cousin be named head of the
border crossing in Palomas, just
across the border from Colum-
bus, New Mexico.
He added that the plan was to
have an inside.man so they could
"cross anything from the U.S. to
Mexico."
U.S. District Judge David
Briones adjourned the hearing
and said Pimentel's testimony
and the defense's turn to ques-
tion him would continue Tues-
day.
According to U.S. authori-
ties, Delgado admitted to fed-
eral Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agents that he
had been contacted by people
in Mexico about slowing down
extradition processes of alleged
cartel members and about mov-
ing up to $600 million from
the U.S. to Mexico. He told the
agents the million dollars seized
was "a trial run" to see if it was
possible, according to the U.S.
government.
If the deal was successful,
Pimentel explained, both he,
Delgado and De La Concha
would receive a percentage of
the money laundered.

Writer promises more U.S. spying secrets

Greenwald says
Snowden reveal
was just the start
DENVER (AP) - The jour-
nalist behind stories about the
National Security Agency's glob-
al spy program promised Mon-
day that there are many more
to come, including details about
the United States spying on its
own citizens.
Glenn Greenwald, an Ameri-
can reporter based in Bra-
zil, spoke by video to a'group

of reporters from around the
Americas gathered in Denver
for ameetingofthe Inter Ameri-
can Press Association. He said
the upcoming reports will be as
significant as the report he co-
wrote in the French newspaper
Le Monde aboutthe NSA sweep-
ing up millions of phone records
in France ina month.
Greenwald said he's com-
mitted to reporting on every
document of public interest
given to him by former NSA
contractor Edward Snowden.
He said he does consider the
potential harm that could be

caused by his disclosures and
consults with experienced edi-
tors and reporters in deciding
what to publish. He also said
they present their reporting
to the government at issue to
listen to officials' view about
publishing the information,
but he acknowledged they usu-
ally disregard it.
"I don't think anyone could
say we have not been thoughtful
enough," he said.
Snowden told Greenwald
earlier this year about the vast
communications-monitoring
programs carried. out by the

agency and its international
counterparts. The revelations
have sparked a raucous debate
about the scale of surveillance
and the erosion of privacy in the
digital age.
Snowden received asylum in
Russia in August.
Greenwald said there's a "sus-
tained attack" on press freedom
in the United States, and he crit-
icized the British government
for asking the Guardian news-
paper to destroy data leaked by
Snowden. He called on journal-
ists everywhere to work togeth-
er to defend their rights.

Perry churns out
chart-ready album

'Prism' just another
product of the
pop machine
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
In 2010, Katy.Perry let loose
an album that would shatter
many a record with its single
releases yet
had a massive C-
initial under-
selling in its Prisi
first week. Katy Perry
Three years
later, Priam Capitol
began taking
form, and lis-
teners-weren't about. to repeat
the mistake of overlooking
another Perry record upon its
debut. This begged the ques-
tion, however, of how the Teen-
age Dream singer was going to
satisfy a crowd that had come
to see her as an artist capable of
spitting out No. 1 after No. 1.
After toying with the rumor
that this fourth studio album
would be a darker change-
over from the happy-go-lucky
dreams of Perry's third record,
the California girl settled for a
less contrastable spiritual ambi-
ence as Prism's overall flavor.
The album's divinity is read-
ily apparent in the track titling
("Unconditionally," "By the
Grace of God," "Spiritual"), but
Perry's revered lyricism tends
to come in over-concentrated
doses.
Prism's straightforwardness
carries major ramifications
with respect to predictability.
Take the record's second pro-
motional single, "Dark Horse."
Prism's only dark track not only
contains "dark" in the title, but
also features every melodic
sequence and sound featured at
your local haunted house. Like-
wise, this spiritually character-
ized album actually has a track
titled "Spiritual." Perry's motifs

couldn't be less subtle.
The "Firework" singer plays
to her strengths on Prism's
purely jubilant songs - songs
that (combined with the
album's ethereal tracks) consti-
tute the record's primary nuts
and bolts. "Birthday" is Perry's
sequel to "Last Friday Night,"
with a near-identical guitar
strum, interrupted by sporadic
bottle popping and an explo-
sive finale. The lead power-pop
single, "Roar," is the album's
obligatory K.P. empowerment
track, sporting an unorthodox
bassline that proves to be sur-
prisingly catchy.
The religious infusion gives a
somewhat original take to this
pop collection, but not enough
to label Perry as anything other
than easy listening. Time and
time again, the former pop-rock
singer brandishes a one-track

mind with an appetite for No.1
songs at all costs. After One
of the Boys, Perry henceforth
became a hit-making machine,
nearly incapable of working
with anybody other than Dr.
Luke and Max Martin.
Just because Prism aims to
advertise itself as a religious
pop album (by way of point-
ed track titles and excessive
reverb) doesn't mean Perry
deserves thunderous applause
for having a meager stylistic
twist. The record is still just
another Max Martin-Dr. Luke
production, magnetized to
the radio in hopes of the top
spot for each single-worthy
track. And if that top spot isn't
reached, expect a few hundred
remixes until it is.
For music that's allegedly so
supernal, Prism shouldn't feel
so uninspired.

Part of this consistency comes
from the show's ingenuity: Each
sketch features a major twist on
expectations, so that even if one
doesn't appreciate the humor,
there's still plenty to appreciate in
the creativity and wit. One sketch
presents itself as a documentary
about a bunch of tech geeks who
work on the first computer in their
garage, but in reality the men are
much more proud of their garage
renovations (such as their invention

could hang their keys) than their
technological breakthroughs. In
general, the premise behind each
sketch proves enjoyable, and even
when a sketch lacks in execution,
some comedic genius does manage
to show through.
Indeed, the show boasts consid-
erable talent with executive pro-
ducers Bob Odenkirk ("Breaking
Bad") and Ben Stiller ("The Ben
Stiller Show") on board. Odenkirk
lends his talent more directly and

Ushio punches an empty can-

through the whiteness in front of

tuous release of emotion - a
tumultuousness that has come
to embody the years he has spent
honing his craft as a well-known
yet struggling artistin the United
States. Noriko watches quietly
from the side, her eyes hidden
behind a coat of sadness.
Documentary "Cutie and
the Boxer," newcomer Zachary
Heinzerling's stirring directorial
debut, is her story.
It's a story framed by her love
for Ushio, but defined by the sac-
rifices she made to keep their
marriage together. A 19-year-old
art student from Japan, she met
her then-41-year-old husband,

studio. "I'd never seen art like it
before," she recalls in the film.

ICE HOCKEY
5 Things We Learned:
New Hampshire

Sophomore cornerback Raymon Taylor and the Michigan secondary have looked uncharacteristically vulnerable.
I n this bye week,
a reversal of roles

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
When Michigan coach Brady
Hoke was asked how this bye
week differed from the one ear-
lier this year, he addressed it lit-
erally. This week, he said during
his Monday press conference, the
players have Tuesday's practice
off.
So mark that down as one dif-
ference. What he didn't address
was the complete 180-degree
turn his team
has taken since NOTEBOOK
the bye week a
month ago. In these schizophren-
ic, lurching first seven games
of the season, the offense and
defense have switched places.
Now, the defense appears
vulnerable, while the offense
has carried the team. Previ-
ously, after two miserable games
against Akron and Connecticut,
the offense was reeling and the
defense had provided the heroics.
The Michigan football team
now enters its toughest stretch
of the year - with games, in con-
secutive weeks, against Michi-
gan State on the road; Nebraska;
Northwestern and Iowa away;
and Ohio State - with a much dif-
ferent set of issues than even one
week ago. Most pressing is the
defense's sudden propensity to
allow big plays.
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison has played his second-
ary loose to prevent passes over,
the top. Against Indiana on Satur-
day, though, the defense allowed
five plays of 20 yards or more.
Now, Michigan's once-reliable,
bend-but-don't-break approach
has yielded 25 plays of 20 yards or
more, good for 89th in the nation.
The Wolverines also rank 82nd
out of 125 FBS teams with six
40-plus-yard plays and 112th with
75 plays of 10 yards or more.
"I know that from a schematic
standpoint, I don't think there's
anything we would want to do
differently. From an execution

standpoint, yeah," Hoke said.
"You've got to make those plays
when you have opportunities
there."
Hoke mentioned that on four
different occasions, a Michigan
defender put a hand on the ball
but failed to make a play. On a
67-yard touchdown pass in the
third quarter, for instance, fresh-
man cornerback Channing Strib-
ling was in position to defend the
pass, but the receiver muscled the
ball away.
Meanwhile, safetyhelp overthe
top has been inconsistent, which
has allowed big gains to turn into
six points. After Striblingcouldn't
defend the pass, fifth-year senior
safety Thomas Gordon took a
poor angle and missed the tackle.
On a 59-yard score, sophomore
safety Raymon Taylor appeared
to expect safety help from Gordon
that never came.
"That's something that you
think you don't have to coach a
whole lot, but you do and you've
got to put them in situations so
they'll have that confidence,"
Hoke said, referringto misplaying
the ball and the safety play. "You
do it during the week, but we have
to emphasize it a little more, and
we have to tackle a little more."
O-LINE OK?: The situation at
offensive line remains murky,
though Saturday provided some
encouraging progress. Against
the Hoosiers, redshirt freshman
Erik Magnuson and redshirt
junior Joey Burzynski got the
start at guard, though Burzynski
missed much of the game with an
injury.
After Burzynski was knocked
out, an array of players got a
chance at guard. Redshirt sopho-
more Chris Bryant and redshirt
freshman Kyle Kalis, who have
each started games, saw time. But
mostly, it was true freshman Kyle
Bosch seeing action.
"I think the guards that played
did a nice job," Hoke said. "Was it
perfect? No. But I think all three
of them did a nice job."

The line has been a constantly
shifting unit for much of the year.
Against Indiana, the running
game looked much improved -
the Wolverines picked up 248
yards on the ground. It's difficult
to gauge how much of that was a
credit to improved blocking and
how much was a shift into the
spread for much of the game.
Plus, Indiana's defensive line
has had its own struggles. Still,
any production from the running
game is an improvement over
week's past.
"Obviously the big test in two
weeks, you're playing one of the
top five defenses in the country
and in our conference in all the
categories," Hoke said of Michi-
gan State. "We've got a lot of work
to do before then."
Hoke indicated the line could
remain in flux. Against Indiana,
Michigan found the best five play-
ers for that game.
But could those five players
change in five weeks in East Lan-
sing?
"It could," Hoke said.
BURZYNSKI OUT: Burzyn-
ski will likely miss the remainder
of the season with a torn ante-
rior cruciate ligament sustained
against Indiana, Hoke said Mon-
day.
Burzynski began as a walk on
but soon worked his way into the
offensive line discussion. He had
played in 21 games before Satur-
day, but the game against Indiana
was the first start of his career.
He was injured in the first
quarter and didn't reenter the
game.
"You feel bad for Joey because
he's worked so hard to get to this
point," Hoke said.
NOTE: Hoke noted that
Burzynski is the only player out
for an extended period of time.
That means senior wide receiver
Drew Dileo, who was injured
on Saturday, should be available
against Michigan State.

1. Zach Nagelvoort provides a
solid backup in net.
Less than two minutes into the
third period Friday against No.
13 New Hampshire, sophomore
goaltender Steve Racine was lay-
ing on his front side in noticeable
pain and unable to continue play
in a tie game on the road. He was
assisted off the ice by sophomore
forward Boo Nieves and fresh-
man defenseman Nolan de Jong,
and did not returnfor the remain-
der of the game.
His early exit prompted the
regular-season debut of Nagel-
voort, the freshman, who hadn't
seen ice time since coming in
halfway through an exhibition
game against Waterloo (Ont.). He
made 15 saves in 15 minutes with-
out allowing a goal en route to a
1-1 tie for No. 4 Michigan (3-0-1).
Nagelvoort made his first
career start the following night
with Racine - who recorded
a career-high 42 saves against
Rochester Institute of Technolo-
gylastweekend - sidelined again
by what was described as a lower
body injury.
After a solid first period,
Nagelvoort surrendered a pair of
scores on just 12 shots in the sec-
ond. The second goal bounced in
off his own skate.
Still, in his impromptu debut
weekend, Nagelvoort recorded
his first career win and kept
Michigan out of the loss column
two nights in a row.
"For his first college hockey
experience to have to come in and
then face a penalty shot, it's pret-
ty good," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "And plus killing
a penalty, I thought he did really
well."
2. Michigan can survive the OT.
After a 7-4 victory over RIT
last Saturday in which the Tigers
erased a 4-0 deficit in a single
period, Bennett said that he
was unsure if last year's team
would've secured the victory.
But twice this weekend, the
Wolverines were forced to play in
front of a reputably hostile sellout
crowd at the Whittemore Center
Arena in Durham, N.H.
Twice, they came away
unscathed.

Without their starting goalie
in the net, Michigan and Nagel-
voort held off New Hampshire
through five minutes of overtime
hockey on Friday, tying the Wild-
cats 1-1.And the Wolverines came
away with a 3-2 overtime-victory
on Saturday when freshman for-
ward Tyler Motte netted a goal
1:37 into the extra frame.
"Those were two good games,"
Berenson said. "We felt (Friday)
night we didn't put our best foot
forward, and the home team
was better. But we survived the
tie. In every category, we were
outplayed or outworked or out-
faceoffed or out-chanced."
For a young team looking
to build its identity froni the
get-go, this weekend's resilient
performance could be a defin-
ing moment. If nothing else, the
Wolverines proved they are con-
ditioned enough to survive extra
hockey when necessary.
3. Guptill provides both power
and flexibility.
On Friday, junior forward Alex
Guptill moved up to the first line
alongside sophomore Andrew
Copp and senior Derek DeBlois.
The trio contributed to the
Wolverines' lone goal, but after-
ward Berenson decided Guptill
would be better suited on a bigger
line with Nieves and junior Phil
Di Giuseppe, who had trouble
connecting in the first game.
It took just 10 minutes on Sat-
urday for the new line to connect.
Guptill took a pass off the side-
boards from Nieves and fired a
shot off the inside of the post and
in - his first goal of the season. Di
Giuseppe picked up an assist on
the play.
Later in the period, Guptill
took a feed from Nieves near the
right circle and slid through the
New Hampshire defense before
netting his second goal of the
game over the shoulder of goal-
tender Casey DeSmith.
4. The freshmen are ready.
On a larger ice surface - one
that stretches 15 feet wider than
regulation - and an even bigger
stage this weekend, Michigan's
nine contributing freshmen were
as unfazed as they had been in
the season opener against Boston
College.
Freshman forward Tyler

Motte played the hero on Satur-
day when, less than two minutes
into overtime, freshman forward
JT Compher found DeBlois who
fed Motte for the game-winning
goal.
Freshman forward Evan Allen
- on an all-freshman line with
Compher and Motte - near-
ly gave the Wolverines a lead
before regulation expired, but his
rebound chance flew high over
the net
Nagelvoort, alate commit from
the United States Hockey League,
saved 22 shots in 24 attempts,
allowing just one goal.
But Nagelvoort's first win
might not have been possible
without the efforts of freshman
defenseman Michael Downing,
who threw his body and stick to
block a shot in the first period.
Freshmen have scored the
game-winning goals in two of
Michigan's three wins this sea-
son.
"They're doing a good job,"
Berenson said. "We knew they
would. Tonight's the first game
we put three freshmen on a line.
We put Allen on a line with Com-
pher and Motte, and I thought
they played well."
5. Racine listed as week-to-week.
Racine watched practice from
stands of Yost Ice Arena on Mon-
day.
Accordingto Berenson, Racine
suffered a groin injury from an
odd save on Saturday. Racine is
unlikely to practice in pads at
all this week, and will miss this
weekend's games against Boston
University and Massachusetts-
Lowell. The injury, though, isn't
one that worries Berenson for the
longrun.
"It's not that serious," Beren-
son said. "But for a goalie who has
to go down all the time, it's more
serious than a regular skater."
As it did this weekend, the
offense will likely have to com-
pensate for the setback.
"(Racine's injury) is not a
worry, that's for sure," said senior
forward Mac Bennett on Friday.
"We have four talented goalten-
ders, and any one of them can
play. Obviously, it's bad to see
Steve go down, but Nagelvoort
came in, stepped up, made a huge
breakaway save right away, and
that definitely has to help his con-
fidence."

Sophomores blossom

By NATE SELL
DailySports Writer
Last year, the Michigan field
hockey team had only one senior
- one lone member of the class
of 2013. This would spell disas-
ter for many teams, but Michi-
gan coach Marcia Pankratz saw a
great opportunity to develop the
young talent she had recruited.
She took the team's 11 freshmen
and threw them into the fire, and
they responded by showing that
they belong at Michigan.
"Last year, it was almost like
they didn't even know they were
supposed to be nervous," Pan-
kratz said. "They held their own
and really solidified some ques-
tion marks we had."
These freshmen were thrown
into starting roles from the first
game of the season, with many
expected to be key contributors
on a team that lacked upperclass-
men. At any time during the year,
it was possible that freshmen
made up more than half of the
team on the field. This was made
possible by the confidence that
Pankratz had in the class.
"I wasn't nervous," Pankratz
said. "That's why we recruited
them. They're Michigan women,
and they can handle anything
outside their comfort zone and
adversity."
Handling the pressure was not
a problem for Lauren Thomas,
who is now a sophomore. Thom-
as is from Aylesbury, England,
where she already had a lot of
experience playing against top-
notch competition in a country

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Back Lauren Thomas is one of a bevy
of sophomores leading Michigan.
where field hockey is much more
popular. She admitted she felt
comfortable in a Michigan uni-
form from day one and has used
that sense of belonging to help
herself and her team this year.
"It's just really nice to take that
experience from freshman year
and give that to the freshmenthat
have been thrown into the fire
this year," Thomas said.
Sophomore Shannon Scavelli
was also expected to be a major
contributor early last year but
took longer to get comfortable.
"Every day was just such a new
experience," Scavelli said. "It was
a privilege to wear the block 'M'
and towards the end of the sea-
son, I started to relax a little more
and just go out there and play."
Now, as sophomores, Thom-
as, Scavelli, Caroline Chromik,
Jaime Dean and Taryn Mark
have a season of experience that
most players their age don't.
They've started every game for
the Wolverines this year, which
has proven to be a distinct advan-

tage, adding depth to the team.
With an experienced sophomore
class, Pankratz is often able to use
around 20 players per game and
rotate often. This allows them
to stay fresh and gives them an
advantage over teams with fewer
players to rotate in.
"They play like upperclassmen
already," Pankratz said. "So it
bodes well."
Added Scavelli: "It was great
to have that experience last year,
but now it's time to really get on
the field and your teammates and
coaches and myself expect a lot
out of one another because we
have been through it already."
This group of sophomores isn't
just making things happen on the
field - they have also grown to be
a very tight group. After being in
the same situation together last
year, they grew closer through
the adversity of being freshmen
playing key roles on the team.
"If we were homesick at the
same time, we were able to talk
to each other, or on the field if we
had any problems, you were able
to talk it out," Scavelli said. "You
didn't feel alone and always had
people to lean on."
This bond has become stron-
ger this year and has started to
spill over to the rest of the team.
With a young core that already
knows what it means to play field
hockey in a Michigan uniform
and great team chemistry, there
is no telling how much this team
can accomplish. They have their
sights set on a Big Ten Champion-
ship, and that isn't too far out of
reach.
