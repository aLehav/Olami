As a memento of its more than
40 years in business, campus con-
venience store Village Corner gave
away free bags of "genuine dust
bunnies from the VC" before clos-

ing its doors on Saturday.
Village Corner owner Dick
Scheer sold his lease for the space,
located at the corner of South Uni-

Avenue, to developer Ron Hughs
who plans to turn the building
into a new student high rise by fall
2012.
Throughout its tenure at that
corner, Village Corner was a wit-

When it first opened in 1970,

there was a movie theater down
the street along with several gift
and clothing stores, according to
Scheer.
"It became restaurant row for
a while, but it's come back with a
little more variety," Scheer said.
During the last few days of busi-

as students bought the last of the
store's toiletries, sodas and bags
of pretzels and chips. The store

DOlWN A NDDITY

Professor agog over Gaga

A professor at the Uni-
versity of South Carolina
will offer a course called
"Lady Gaga and the Sociol-
ogy of Fame," next spring
according to an Oct. 28 arti-
cle in The New York Times.
The 48-year-old pro-
fessor, Mathieu Defiem,
is a self-proclaimed Lady
Gags fan. According to the
article, Defiemn has been to
more than 28 of her shows,
owns more than 300 of her
records and created a fan
site devoted to Lady Gags.
The course will cover the
topics of Lady Gags's rise to
fame and the implications
of her fame in today's soci-
ety, according to the article.
The course description
states, "The central objec-
tive is to unravel some of
the sociologically relevant

dimensions of the fame of
Lady Gags."
GAY MEMBERS OF
FRATERNITY AT
VANDERBILT FORCED
TO LEAVE
In violation of anti-
discriminatory student
organization policies, the
president of Vanderbilt Uni-
versity's Beta Upsilon Chi
fraternity asked two homo-
sexual members to leave
the fraternity, according to
a Nov. 4 Vanderbilt Hustler
article.
The Christian fraternity,
also a registered religious
student organization, has
a code of conduct that for-
bids homosexuality. Two
former fraternity members
said fraternity president

Greg Wigger pressured
them to leave the fraternity
because they violated the
code of conduct, according
to the article.
Gary White, director of
religious life at Vanderbilt,
said in the article "(BYX)
can have a statement of
faith and conduct of behav-
ior ...but they would not be
able to deny or remove any
member based on their
Code of Conduct." The cur-
rently unresolved issue
will be addressed in a BYX
meeting in a few weeks.

DETROIT
Bing to Snyder:
Since we're both
businessmen, let's
work together
Democratic Detroit Mayor
Dave Bing says the business back-
ground he shares with Republi-
can Gov.-elect Rick Snyder should
help them cooperate on solving
the depressed city's problems.
Bing endorsed fellow Demo-
crat Virg Bernero, who lost to
Snyder in Tuesday's election.
The Detroit News says Bing
sent Snyder a letter of congratu-
lations. Bing's letter says vot-
ers are looking for "leadership
that moves beyond the partisans
battles" that have held the state
"back for so long."
Bing says he and Snyder come
from the same background as
entrepreneurs. Bing ran a steel
business before running for
mayor, while Snyder is an ex-

GOP complains
Tea Party prevent-
ed Senate control
Tea party-backed candidates
helped and hindered Republicans,
injecting enthusiasm into cam-
paigns but losing Senate seats held
by Democrats in Delaware, Colo-
rado and Nevada that the GOP
once had big hopes of capturing.
Republican leaders and strate-
gists are muttering that the same
tea party activists who elevated
Speaker-to-be John Boehner and
the party to power in the House
simultaneously hobbled the GOP's
outside shot of running the Sen-
ate. Tea partiers largely spurned
establishment candidates in the
GOP primaries and helped nomi-
nate Christine O'Donnell in Dela-
ware, Sharron Angle in Nevada
and Ken Buck in Colorado. All
three lost on Tuesday.
"You let the voters decide" the
nominees, Republican National
Committee chairman Michael
Steele said Friday. "It's a risk. Vot-
ing is a risk."
PESHAWAR, Pakistan
Pakistan says two
U.S. drone strikes
killed 14 militants
A pair of American drone
strikes killed 14 suspected mili-
tants in northwestern Pakistan
yesterday, local intelligence offi-
cials said, in the latest attacks
against al-Qaida and Taliban
militants seeking sanctuary in
the region.
The missiles struck an hour

apart in the North Waziristan -
the area that has seen the tover-
whelmi ng majority of drone strikes
over the last two months. The rug-
ged region is home to hundreds of
Pakistani and foreign militants,
many belonging to or allied with
al-Qaida and the Taliban.
in the first strike, one Ameri-
can missile slammed into a
house and another hit a vehicle
in the town of Ghulam Khan just
north of Miran Shah, the main
town in North Waziristan, the
two officials said. Nine insur-
gents were killed.
An hour later, another pair of
missiles struck a vehicle in the
nearby town of Datta Khel, killing
five suspected militants, the offi-
cials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity because they weren't
authorized to talk to the media.

The two men vying for prime

President voices
support for Pakistan
during India visit
NEW DELHI (AP) - Hampered
by heavy election losses at home,
President Barack Obama promised
from India yesterday to make "mid-
course corrections" to reinvigorate
his embattled domestic agenda in
the face of a testierAmerican public
and more combative Congress.
On a day of friendly outreach,
Obama also was confronted about
his support for Pakistan, New
Delhi's nuclear neighbor and rival.
He defended the alliance while
acknowledging that Pakistan-based
extremists are "a cancer" with the
potential to "engulf the country."
His comments took on added
significance because he spoke in
Mumbai, where memories are fresh
from attacks in 2008 by Pakistani
assailants that killed 166 in the
city. Obama urged the two nations
to talk peace; he didn't commit the
U.S. as-middle man.
Domestic politics followed
Obama across the globe, and he
tried to explain how he will reca-
librate his presidency from the
rubble of this past week's elections.
The topic came up not in response
to a question from a Washington
reporter but rather an Indian col-
lege student, who told Obama: "It
seems that the American people
have asked for a change."
The president agreed that peo-
ple vented their frustration about
the economy by sacking many
incumbents. A "healthy thing," he
said, even though his Democratic.
Party suffered, losing control of
one of the chambers in Congress.

He said he would not retreat on
spending money for energy and
education, and offered no specific
policy changes.
But then he added that the elec-
tion "requires me to make some mid-
course corrections and adjustments.
And how those play themselves out
over the next several months will be
a matter of me being in discussions
with the Republican Party."
Obama's words reflected the
new political reality, sinking in by
the day, that he must give ground
to have hopes of advancing the
leftover promises of his 2008 cam-
paign. He is increasingly likely to
compromise on extending tax cuts
not just for the middle class but for
the rich, at least temporarily, and
will focus more on bringing down
the federal deficit.
For all his emphasis on jobs and
security, Obama was determined
to make yesterday a more casual
expression of his engagement in
India. And this picture emerged: a
rigid but good-spirited attempt by
the president to dance with chil-
dren, who pulled him fromhis chair
to join them and his wife, Michelle,
already participating gracefully.
That scene unfolded at a school
where the Obamas spoke with stu-
dents about science projects and
helped celebrate the religious festival
known as Diwali. Said one boy after-
ward: "I amfeelingvery proud."
The centerpiece of Obama's day
was his stop at St. Xavier College,
a Jesuit institution where students
waited for hours outside for him in
the heat.
Obama has used this town hall
fornat in his foreign travels as a
comfortable way to connect with
people, although by the time he was
done offering advice to the students,

he only had room for six questions.
One of the sharper ones was this
- "Whyis Pakistan soimportant an
ally to America, so far as America
has never called it a terrorist state?"
There were some murmurs from
the audience.
Obama said it was OK. He knew
it was coming.
Muslim-dominated Pakistan
and Hindu-majority India have
gone to war and still hold deep
suspicions. Indian officials accuse
Pakistan's intelligence service of
helping orchestrate the Mumbai
attacks and say Islamabad has not
done enough to crack down on the
Pakistan-based extremists held
responsible.
Pakistan views India's ties with
the U.S.-backed government in
Afghanistan as an effort by its old
rival to encircle it.
Obansa even got a prickly
response from some Indian com-
mentators on his first day in the
country for failingto mention Paki-
stan when honoring the memo-
ries of those killed in the Mumbai
attacks.
To his audience yesterday, he said
the Pakistani government under-
stands the dangerous elements that
hide and operate within its bor-
ders. He also defended the strategic
importance of Pakistan to the Unit-
ed States, as he has about India.
"We will work with the Paki-
stani government in order to
eradicate this extremism that
we consider a cancer within the
country that can potentially
engulf the country." He said the
U.S. approach is to "be honest and
forthright with Pakistan, to say
we are your friend, this is a prob-
lem and we will help you, but the
problem has to be addressed."

Republicans rally
in favor of agenda
opposed to White
House priorities
WASHINGTON (AP) - Resur-
gent Republicans rallied yester-
day behind an agenda based on
unwavering opposition to the
Obama White House and federal
spending, laying the groundwork
for gridlock until their 2012 goal:
a new president, a "better Sen-
ate" and ridding the country of
that demonized health care law.
Republicans said they were
willing to work with President
Barack Obama but also sig-
naled it would be only on their
terms. With control of the White
House and the Senate, Demo-
crats showed no sign they were

conceding the final two years of
Obama's term to Republican law-
makers who claimed the majority
in the House.
"I think this week's election
was a historic rejection of Ameri-
can liberalism and the Obama
and Pelosi agenda," said Rep.
Mike Pence, the Indiana Repub-
lican who is stepping down from
his post in GOP leadership. "The
American people are tired of the
borrowing, the spending, the
bailouts, the takeovers."
Voters on Tuesday pun-
ished Democrats from New
Hampshire to California, giv-
ing Republicans at least 60 new
seats in the House.
Republicans picked up 10 gov-
ernorships; the GOP also gained
control of 19 state legislative
chambers and now holds the
highest level of state legislative
seats since 1928.

Reporters at the scene saw a
threatening message left with the

apparent reference to the Zetas
druggang.
The gruesome find came a week
after two young men who had
been involved in violent university
protests and other conflicts were
gunned down in the middle of the
day in a public plaza.
An e-mail purportedly from the
Zetas claimed responsibility for
those slayings and said that the
two were killed for falsely repre-
senting themselves as members of
the gang.
Oaxaca state Attorney General
Maria de la Luz Candelaria Chinas
said the e-mail is suspected to be
fake, although she said authorities
had not ruled out the possibility
that the Zetas sent it.
Mexican government offi-
cials describe the Zetas - former
hit men for the Gulf cartel who
became independent this year -
as a sort of franchise with units
across the country. But officials
say some of those cells are copycats
using the Zetas name to intimidate
extortion and kidnap victims.

over the past decade, and experts
warn their clout could grow fol-

beheadings in recent years, cartel-
style violence is rare in Oaxaca, the
capital of the southern state by the
same name, especially compared
to northern Mexico or the central
Pacific coast.

MATT AARONSON
MANAGING EDITOR

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of the Daily's editorial board. All other signed articles
and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.
Turn up the turnout
No matter the election, students should vote
 ast Tuesday, when Americans headed to the polls, one
demographic was visibly absent. Only about 20 percent of
people under the age of 30 voted in the Nov. 2 midterm
election, according to a Nov. 4 Daily article. While midterm elec-
tions usually post lower turnout than presidential elections, these
numbers are distressingly low, especially considering the govern-
mental change that resulted from this election and the impact
that change will have on students. With important issues and
positions on the ballot, it's imperative that students show up at
the polls for each and every election.

The upside to distance

In Ann Arbor, only about 21 percent of
voters in areas that house large numbers of
students turned out for Tuesday's election,
according to the Daily article. In 2008, 55
percent of people tinder the age of 30 voted
nationwide. Student-filled districts in Ann
Arbor posted a slightly lower rate of 45
percent. The 2006 midterm election saw
a 23-percent turnout among young people
nationwide - three percent higher than
national turnout this year.
Democracy only works when citizens
voice their opinions and concerns by vot-
ing. votes hold elected officials account-
able for their actions: When they fail to
accurately represent their constituents,
voters can remove them from office. But if
students choose not to cast a ballot, elect-
ed officials have no incentive to represent
their interests. And if only 20 percent of
young people vote in an election, govern-
ment officials remain uninterested in
pushing for causes like increased funding
for higher education.
This election in particular was a big
opportunity for students to make their
voices heard, even though it didn't focus
on an individual quite as charismatic as
President Barack Obama. Michigan elect-
ed a new governor and Republicans took
the U.S. House of Representatives and
both houses of the Michigan legislature.

The two incumbent University regents up
for re-election - both of whom have done
little in their terms to stop tuition increas-
es - remain in office. Without student
votes to hold these officials accountable
for their decisions, they will continue to
ignore what students need and want.
All elections are important. Issues
addressed at all levels of government will
ilways affect students' lives. From the
governor's stance on the Michigan Prom-
ise Scholarship and to Ann Arbor Mayor
John Hieftje's plans for the proposed Full-
er Road Transportation Center, students
feel the impact of governmental decisions
in their everyday lives. And the onus is
on students to make sure their opinion is
being heard.
There are a lot of excuses for why stu-
dents don't vote - they don't know about
the issues, don't know where to vote or
haven't bothered to register, don't have
the time to vote between classes, etc. But
students have to overcome apathy to affect
change. Regardless of the hassle of going to
the polls or sending in an absentee ballot,
students need to take the time to educate
themselves about candidates and issues
and vote.
Voting isn't just a right: it's also a respon-
sibility. And until students step up, their
interests won't be adequately represented.

'm in a long-distance relation-
ship - and I'm happy with it.
Now, before the three of you
that read this col-
umn start flood-
ing my inbox with
sympathies and
slurs, allow me to
explain.
If there's one
thing those of us
at the University
find more stupid
than midterms MELANIE
and Michigan
State students, it's KRUVELIS
long-distance rela-
tionships. Upper-
classmen, with their worldly wisdom
and higher alcohol tolerance, scoff at
freshman who are still caught up in
high school relationships. The criti-
cisms are familiar: "You're too afraid
to move on. Train tickets are expen-
sive. Eventually someone's going to
want to get laid."
And I understand the objections.
Maintaining a relationship in a com-
pletely new town is already difficult
enough. Factor in a few extra hun-
dred miles and suddenly things can
become overwhelming.
Overwhelming, however, doesn't
mean impossible. Once I got used to
the idea of being drooled on by tooth-
less men on my bus rides between
Ann Arbor and Kalamazoo, I started
to realize that long-distance relation-
ships may be not be as abhorrent as
those sagely upperclassmen think.
An immediate benefit of being far
away from your significant other is
that you are, in fact, far away from
your significant other. There seems
to be this perception that a long-
distance relationship means hours
huddled up in your dorm room, blab-
bering about the bagel you had for
breakfast and the difficulties in pick-
ing out aschmear.
Truth be told, dear readers, this

constant state of incoherent and
annoying chatter is merely a miscon-
ception. The beauty of long-distance
love is that you really don't need to
spend time with your significant
other. I don't have to spend my time
going on awkward morning-after
dates at Wendy's in the Union, or
devote hours to cuddling and draw-
ing hearts all over my boyfriend's
econ notes. Instead, I get to do what I
cherish most - eat and watch TV.
"But what about those dirty primal
instincts?" the dissenter will argue.
"Eventually those will kick in." Per-
saps it'll be the back issues of Cosmo-
politan msagazine, or maybe the latest
episode of "Degrassi" - whatever it
may be, something will jumpstart the
old sex drive. And unless you're will-
ing to cheat or heed Cosmo's advice
and partake in some bizarre activi-
ties that make me fairly uncomfort-
able, you're screwed (or not so much,
depending on your interpretation of
the word).
However, most of us really don't
travel via covered wagon these days.
it's not that hard to get from point A
to point B when those, uh, needs kick
in. You know that old phrase, "dis-
tance makes the heart grow fonder"?
I don't know about all that, but there
is sufficient evidence that distance
does make the nooky better and less
dramatic. Long-distancers never have
those awkward mornings where you
somehow wake up in a floor-mate's
bed. We never have to suffer through
the walk of shame, heading to class in
an oversized t-shirt and a pair of too-
large basketball shorts. Simply put,
you never have to start a story with,
"Last night was such a mistake - he
was an OSU fan!" Your relationship
becomes a routine of sharing only the
most important details of your day,
followed by weekend whoopee. And
'for someone as emotionally calloused
asI am, it really doesn'tget any better.
Furthermore, there's an aspect

even dirtier than sex that makes
long-distance a dream: my hygiene
habits. I've seen girls who not only
leave for their 9 a.m. class on time,
but actually get up early to gussy up
for it. Long-distancers, besides the
few with "self-respect" or whatever,
really don't feel the same need to look
cute for lecture. If you aren't looking
to shack up or, you know, start a rela-
tionship, there really isn't a reason to
get all fussy and gussy.
Long-distance
relationships have
advantages.
Instead, I get the extreme pleasure
of rolling out of bed wearing what I
wore the last three days while sport-
ing a hairdo that puts Alfalfa from
"The Little Rascals" to shame. Do I
care that my sweatshirt is covered
in pudding stains? Of course not.
Am I embarrassed when I enter my
philosophy discussion wearing my
headgear? Not at all. I take pride in
my ability to look completely unat-
tractive during the school week. It's
feminism. Well, it's lazy feminism.
Actually, it might not be feminism at
all. Regardless, it makes it a whole lot
easier to feel less guilty when I don't
brush my hair for days on end.
So yes, I am in a long-distance rela-
tionship. And you know what? I do
see it outlasting Thanksgiving break,
thank you very much, for two main
reasons: First, I truly care about my
boyfriend. Second - and perhaps
most importantly - after this column
runs, it's highly unlikely that anyone
will ever ask me out again.

Lend a hand to FIMRC


All in for Michigan

It has been several weeks since the celebra-
tion of University's 50th anniversary of the
founding of the Peace Corps. But with all the
excitement about President John F. Kennedy's
historic visit dying down, it's important not to
lose sight of the essence of his address on the
steps of the Union: service to humanity.
The Foundation for the International Medi-
cal Relief of Children is a national organization
helping to answer that call for global service.
FIMRC was started in 2002 to address the
health disparities found in many countries,
paying particular attention to the plight of
underserved pediatric groups. The foundation
operates through clinic sites to provide high-
quality medical care and preventative educa-
tion to those who don't have access to health
care. At the clinic sites, children often come in
malnourished or with pneumonia. First, the
doctor needs to prescribe medication to imme-
diately treat the problem. But often, the prob-
lem is due to poor hygiene or parasites and the
patient and the family need to be educated on
how to prevent the problem from occurring in
the future.
Since its inception, this national organiza-
tion has started self-sustaining clinics around
the world and now has over 3,000 staff and
volunteers who help carry out their dream of
improving the health of children in impover-
ished situations all around the world.
But what makes FIMRC unique is the impor-
tance of its many college chapters. It's primar-
ily through the fundraising efforts, of college
chapters that the clinic sites around the world
stay open all year.
Something service organizations - like ours
- are often asked is, "Why does FIMRC bother
going abroad? Why don't you focus on help-
ing U.S. citizens in need?" Some people may
think that we need to honor our duty to our
own country before helping people overseas.
But I believe if we accept arguments like this,
we will be valuing the lives of Americans over
those around the world - and that is undesir-
able. The value of a person's life is the same, no
matter where they were born.
But we don't believe in neglecting our com-
munity. FIMRC strongly believes in having a
large local impact. As one of the volunteering
chairs, I can certainly say this is true, since

my role in FIMRC is to find opportunities for
FIMRC members to help reach out to the local
Ann Arbor community. We hold a variety of
events from volunteering at elderly homes and
serving at soup kitchens to hosting theme par-
ties for kids at Mott Children's Hospital.
So how can students get involved in service
projects here and abroad? FIMRC gives stu-
dents the ability to help out in several ways.
We'll help find opportunities for students who
join FIMRC to serve in your local community
in a variety of ways.
Another hands-on way to get involved is to
travel to one of the clinic sites and volunteer.
I went for a week to Costa Rica to visit the
clinic site this past summer. When you are at
the clinic, you can see the health problems that
underserved populations experience and some
of the political and socio-economic reasons for
those problems. The impact on your life will
hopefully be profound. Once you come back
from a mission trip, you will be more willing to
educate others about what you have seen and
have a greater passion for fundraising for the
clinics based off your firsthand experiences.
The final way to help out with service proj-
ects is to go to some of the fundraising events
FIMRC holds. We will be holding our largest
fundraiser of the school year, the annual Ben-
efit Dinner, on Nov. 11 in the Psych Atrium in
East Hall. Restaurants from all over Ann Arbor
donate food to the event for students and the
community to enjoy. There will also be items
up for auction at the event. The admission
ticket for the dinner will get you as much food
as you can fit onto one plate and, more impor-
tantly, it will go directly to improving the lives
of children around the world.
As students we need to do everything we can
to help promote a spirit of volunteerism and
service. In the end, it's not a matter of which
organization you choose to work with, but
rather the motivation and passion with which
we work. I hope we don't simply reminisce
about the great service deeds done by Univer-
sity students in the past, but rather use that
legacy to propel us to do greater acts of service
in our community and around the world.
Stephen Philip is the volunteering
co-chair of FIMRC.

've had a Michigan State Spartans
baseball cap forseveral years now.
Past a blur of maize and blue hats
and shirts, it lies
somewhere in the
back of my closet
and rarely do I even
get a glimpse of it,
let alone wear it.
But I bought it, and
I'm proud to own itA
because the Spar-
tans have always
been my second IMRAN
favorite college
team. SYED
I could try to
explain that odd-
ity - why a kid
who grew up a stone's throw from
Ann Arbor, who first had season tick-
ets for Michigan football in the days
of Tom Brady and Tai Streets, and
who attended this great university
for undergraduate and law degrees
would ever have anything but pure,
irrepressible disdain for the Spartans.
I could try to explain it, but it's some-
thing the average student on this cam-
pus wouldn't understand.
But I think I can explain to those
of you who grew up in Michigan and
stayed here through the apocalypse.
Here in what's left of Michigan, we
love our own. It's hard to explain that
feeling. How exactly do you explain a
feeling?
It's the feeling I had when I drove
to East Lansing on Friday, Oct. 29.
The date doesn't particularly matter,
except that it was the day before the
Spartan football team lost for the first
time this season, and just four days
before the election. You'll understand
why that mattered in a second.
I hadn't been to the campus of
that other Michigan school in nearly
15 years. Many high school friends

attended MSU, and I've driven by that
exit on the way to Lansing, Grand
Rapids or Lake Michigan countless
times, but never had the need to go
there. A couple of weeks ago, how-
ever, law school business pushed me
finally into East Lansing.
A simple college town, imore rural
and less matured than Ann Arbor,
East Lansing is home to the eighth
largest university campus in the
country - but it's not much to see.
That day, however, the way I spoke of
it, it may as well have been the eighth
wonder of the world.
There was a reason why I madly
sputtered praises in the car that day
for everything having to do with that
university, that city, that region and
its people: I wasn't driving alone. With
me was a fellow law student - an out-
of-stater, a West-Coast-to-East-Coast
transplant - with little knowledge
or interest in what a silly old "fly-
over state" like Michigan has to offer.
Naturally, my instincts as a protective
Michigander were highly activated.
Michigan may have suffered a fright-
eningly unprecedented socio-econom-
ic siege in recent decades, but I'll be
damned if I can't say enough good to
efface that monumental bad.
Suddenly Tom Izzo (head basket-
ball coach of the Spartans) wasn't a
hated rival, but instead, the great-
est basketball mind to ever grace the
Earth. Geoffrey Fieger (infamous
trial lawyer and alumnus of what
later became MSU's law school) was
no longer a self-aggrandizing sleaze,
but instead, the greatest champion
for the poor and oppressed that the
legal world had ever seen. And my
proud account of MSU's reputation
as a top-notch party school cer-
tainly didn't stop that day to mock-
ingly mention the instances of sexual
assault and rioting on campus after

sporting events.
(Hell, I barely stopped short of
bragging that good old Wallace Jeffer-
son himself was once a Spartan. Oh,
yes you have heard of him - the first
ever black chief justice of the Texas
Supreme Court - totally a huge deal.)
My friend in the car couldn't have
cared less, but that doesn't matter. My
experience that day is what Michi-
ganders feel everyday - the immense
urge to fight back against the national
decrial of what this state should be
and isn't with a louder pronouncement
of everything Michigan is and can be
despite the odds. We still believe that
we can rise again, and we take pride in
every little success.

The Spartans
are also part of
my Michigan.

That's why the tears welled up
the next day when I watched the
Iowa Hawkeyes obliterate the Spar-
tans' hopes of a prestigious football
national championship. That's also
why, four days later, I cheered when
Michigan voters boldly embraced
Republican governor-elect Rick
Snyder, a maverick who promises to
break the status quo and help Michi-
gan finally get moving again.
It may be optimism, or it may
be blind folly: But we were stand-
ing once, and we are ready to get
up again. We'll have new stories of
greatness soon, but until then, we'll
cherish all the old ones.

COUCH BAN
From Page 1A
As Taylor emphasized in the
interview, the point of the ban is
not to hand out fines.
"The goal of the ordinance has
nothing to do with fines," Taylor
said. "It has everythingto do with
removing porch couches."
Taylor added that he will
be "delighted" if a fine is never
issued.
"Our goal is to have there be

attorney general's office. Sellek
also said Shirvell's personal leave
of absence ended Friday, but the
panel placed him on administra-
tive leave until a decision about
his employment is made this
week.
Thomas said he does not know
if the panel or Cox will decide the
status of Shirvell's employment
with the state.
"I don't know who's going to
make the ultimate determination,
but ... I think these four people
will make a decision, and wheth-
er they seek to have it ratified by
Mr. Cox or not, I honestly do not
know how that is going to work,"
Thomas said.
Cox publicly defended Shirvell's
actions - claiming Shirvell's First
Amendment right to free speech
protected his actions - during
an interview with CNN's Ander-
son Cooper last month, though he

Taylor said.
In a separate interview yes-
terday, Ann Arbor Fire Marshal
Kathleen Chamberlain agreed
with Taylor, saying the Ann Arbor
Fire Department is much more
concerned about regulating safe-
ty issues associated with the ban
than issuing fines.
"Nobody's intent is to issue
citations, but to get cooperative
compliance," Chamberlain said.
Chamberlain added that the
fire department's role in enforcing
the ban will be confined mainly
to moving upholstered porch fur-
called Shirvell's actions immature
and said they showed a lack of
judgment.
According to Thomas, there
are several possible outcomes of
the hearing - including the dis-
missal of the case, the issue of a
cautionary letter or reprimand,
suspension with or without pay or
termination from the job.
"It's very obvious as the lawyer
representing Mr. Shirvell, I would
like to see the entire proceeding
dismissed," Thomas said.
Armstrong and his attorney
filed a pair of complaints with
the Michigan Attorney Grievance
Commission last week calling for
an investigation into Shirvell's
actions and possible disciplinary
action, including potential disbar-
ment.
"I felt that I could not stand
by and let Mr. Shirvell continue
his reckless, bullying behavior,"
Armstrong said in a statement at
the time.
Deborah Gordon, Armstrong's
attorney, told The Michigan Daily
at the time that the complaints

endangerment to life and safety,"

were filed because she and Arm-
strong believed Shirvell had vio-
lated several ethical guidelines in
the Michigan Rules of Profession-
al Conduct, which every attorney
in the state must agree to follow in
order to practice law.
on Wednesday, the University
of Michigan Department of Public
Safety modified a trespass order
against Shirvell. The order pre-
viously prohibited Shirvell from
stepping foot on the University's
Ann Arbor campus. After the
modification, Shirvell is now able
to be on campus. However, he is
not allowed to attend events -
such as MSA meetings - where
Armstrong is likely to be present
and must leave any event where he
sees that Armstrong is present.
Shirvell's attorney told the
Daily earlier this week that he was
happy the trespass order had been
modified to allow Shirvell on cam-
pus, but that he wasn't sure DPS
had the right to order Shirvell to
avoid events that Armstrong may
attend, saying he wasn't sure if
such an order was constitutional.

said.
In addition to offering sham-
poo, chips and other typical conve-
nience store items, Village Corner
was a go-to spot in the area for
wine, according to employee Jorge
Lopez-Chavez. He added that
patrons who have grown accus-
tomed to buying wine at the store
were sad to find out it is temporar-
ily closing.
"A lot of people have been ask-
ing us where we are going, what is
going on," said Lopez-Chavez, who
was in charge of buying the store's
wine. "We hear comments of all
kinds, but one of my favorites is
when people say they'll never find
another store like this one."
But, throughout last week, many
students didn't realize the shop was
closing until they went inside and
noticed the lack of inventory.
"It's been busy, but it's interest-
ing how much people don't notice
we're moving," Village Corner
employee Peter Brzezinski said.
The store officially closed its
doors around 1 p.m. on Saturday,
after a busy morning due to the
annual Mudbowl game at Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity, which

took placeabout oneblock fromVil-
lage Corner.
Students who frequent the store
said they were sad to hear the store
is closing because it offers a wide
array of snacks and drinks in acon-
venient location.
Engineering sophomore Greg
Rocys went to Village Corner on
Friday with his friend Domenic
Delegato, a senior in the Col-
lege of Engineering. As the two
bought drinks and snack bars they
expressed their disappointment in
the store's move.
"It's about the convenience fac-
tor because we live right across
the street, and we come here for
late-night snacks and stuff," Rocys
said. "From proximity, Strickland's
is right there, but I don't think they
sell food and stuff."
Delegato agreed, saying "It's
kind of likea mini-Meijer."
With his focus on closing the
shop and making plans for the
store's new location, Scheer said he
didn't have the chance to get nos-
talgic about his experience at the
South University location.
"We're still working on packing
up so no time for sentimentality at
thispoint,"Scheersaid."I'mstillfull
steam ahead. I've got to finish this
project and then starta new one."




TAILGATES
From Page 1A
"Crowd size is a big issue," he
said, adding that the fights and
unrestricted alcohol use that tend
to occur with large crowd sizes
are "not acceptable."
But students at the meeting
expressed a desire for more spe-
cifics as to how to avoid receiving
tickets.
Peri Silverman, vice chair of
the Greek Relations Select Com-
mittee, said committee members
have often felt that police offi-
cers failed to give them adequate
explanations for why they were
ticketed in the past.
"People aren't able to gauge the
situation," she said.
According to Title IX, Chap-
ter 119 of the Ann Arbor City
Code, residents can be ticketed
for a noise violation if any music
or noise can be heard beyond the
property line. However, Seto said
enforcement of the ordinance is
up to an officer's discretion.
"You're not going to geta ticket
every time," he said.
In September 2009, several
houses on the 900 block of South
State Street received a letter from
a City of Ann Arbor attorney, who
warned students that their land-
lords would be sued if they contin-
ued to litter, cause excessive noise
and supply alcohol to minors on
Football Saturdays.
Seto said there has been an
improvement in student behavior
since past game days, when the
size of parties near the intersec-
tion of South State Street and East
Hoover Avenue had presented
serious safety concerns in the eyes
of police.
During the game against Mich-
igan State University last month,
police gave only two tickets at that
intersection. In one instance, the
students had disregarded a pre-
vious warning from police, and
the other resulted from a student

throwing a beer can at an officer,
which Seto said will always result
in a ticket.
During the discussion, the
group also talked about litter-
ing violations issued by police on
Football Saturdays for red cups
and bottles strewn on lawns. Seto
said litter violations are different
from noise violations and that the
ordinance is based on "commu-
nity standards."
"Citizens cannot understand
why students can't put their trash
in the trash bins," he said.
Students expressed a willing-
ness to clean up after their own
parties but felt that they weren't
given enough time to do so before
they were given tickets.
Seto responded that the ordi-
nance was intended to prevent
trash from blowing onto neigh-
boring yards, and that the amount
of trash - rather than how long it
had been outside - was the deter-
mining factor in issuing a viola-
tion. He suggested that students
take their concerns to the Ann
Arbor City Council and attempt to
revise the ordinance.
Andy Snow, a member the Alpha
Delta Phi fraternity, expressed
frustration that there appears to
be a double standard in enforce-
ment. While students in residen-
tial areas receive trash violations,
adults litter without consequence
on public property like Pioneer
High School and the University's
golf course.
"I understand it's a tough situa-
tion, but when we say students are
feeling targeted that's what they
see," he said. "I would think it's a
bigger problem on public property
than it would be on private prop-
erty ... especially the golf course.
That's more or less our golf course,
and it's completely trashed."
Seto responded by saying that
Pioneer High School and the golf
course are removed from residen-
tial areas and have fences that
prevent litter from blowing onto
private property. But he said stu-

dents in residential areas have to
respect their neighbors.
"I'm not saying that makes it
right," he said, adding that the
location of the trash - whether
it's in a residential area or not - is
the important factor.
Despite the somewhat con-
flicting perspectives brought to
the meeting, there were a few
points representatives from the
fraternities and police could
agree on.
Seto expressed support for the
Sober Monitor Training Program,
which Greek members redesigned
last year to promote safer parties
and to limit alcohol-related prob-
lems. Seto called the program "a
great idea" with "a lot of poten-
tial" and suggested students could
use sober monitors as a way to
check for noise and litter viola-
tions.
He also said it's important to
have sober monitors present to
interact with police if problems
arise.
"You can't talk yourself out of
a ticket, but you can talk yourself
into a ticket," he said.
There was a general consensus
among those present to make the
meeting the start of a lasting dia-
logue between those in Greek life
and the police department.
"We would like to work with
you guys and keep the lines of
communication open," said LSA
junior Rick Stepanovic, Interfra-
ternity Council ex-officio repre-
sentative to MSA.
Seto also expressed support
for more communication, but said
the constant turnover of Univer-
sity students has in the past hurt
attempts at long-term communi-
cation.
He added that it is a little late
in the year for changes tobe made,
with football season winding
down and the weather growing
colder, but that plans are already
being made for next year.
"Cold weather puts a damper on
people's mood to party," he said.

over five (!!!) times, four on offense
and one on special teams. Illinois
started five drives in Michigan ter-
ritory, and only twice did itstart
within its own 20-yard line.
Not thebestsituation for a
defense to work with.
A week ago, Michigan allowed 41
points to Penn State. On Saturday,
Illinois had posted 45 points by the
end of regulation. Thisgame marks
the first time in Michigan football's
131-year history that it has allowed at
least 40 points in consecutive weeks.
But there were signs of prog-
ress, though ultimately Illinois's
65 points on the scoreboard won't
show it. Key plays from young
defensive players were easy to point
to, and so was the fact that Illinois
punted six times (compared to Penn
State's two punts last week).
Throughout Michigan'sfirst five
wins, critics said the Wolverines
were lucky the offense couldbail
out an increasingly disappointing
defense.
Look at the game-ending play
- or big third-down stops earlier

in the game - and at least this one
time,you can see the defense "kind
of paid the offensebacka littlebit,"
like Roh said.
And don't forget the most signifi-
cant gift the defensesgave the pro-
gram:bowl eligibility, something
that hadbeen taken for granted for
33 straight years. The pasttwo win-
ters havebeen awfully quiet around
Ann Arbor, and it was easy to see
the relief inplayers' faces after Sat-
urday's game.
Under Rodriguez, Michigan had
been 0-for-8 in games in which it
could clinchbowl eligibility. Get-
ting that sixth win was huge.
"We knew ourbacks were up
against the wall," Rodriguez said.
"Like I told them, when yourbacks
are against the wall, you can go
two ways: You can go forward or
slump down. I didn'twant anybody
slumped down, and I don'tthink
anybody did."
The defense has had its back
against the wall, or at least its back
against an endzone, for much of the
season.

Her revelation regarding "time

of the cinematic effect of music,
which, partially through its use
in visual art forms, has become
a signifier and trigger of visual
memory.
Music and film have historically
been intertwined in prominent
ways, most obviously through
the classic film musicals of the
Hollywood studio era and the
more modern musicals of the last
decade. The two have also been
combined in rock films over the
past 50 years, including "A Hard
Day's Night" (1964) as well as
contemporary pop soundtrack-
based movies like "Garden State"
(2004) and every film in Cameron
Crowe's filmography.

The tracks are as saturated in as

album awash in bright sounds and
optimism.
Sidewalks's first single "Cam-

umphant spirit. Slathered in horns
and heavy with Kim's drums, it has
a surprisingly down home hip-hop

FILM REVIEW
Tyler Perry gets serious

The Radio Dept. trip-hops
its way into the background

'For Colored Girls'
is melodramatic, yet
still poignant
ByJENNIFER XU
DailyArts Writer
Rape, abortion, murder, child
abuse and incest - the sensitive
themes of "For
Colored Girls" are
all in a day's work
for Tyler Perry, For Colored
who (shock-
ingly) has chosen Girls
to make a film At Quality16
chronicling the and Rave
troublesof abused an ate
women instead of Liogale
another cross-
dressing Madea family fest.
For the past eight years, Perry
has churned out film after film
about the Brown family with the
regularity of a young Woody Allen
- films widely panned by critics,
yet often celebrated by black audi-
ences. So despite the film's largely
experimental nature, we shouldn't
expect Perry's latest, an adaptation
of Ntozake Shange's off-Broadway
poem-play "For Colored Girls Who
Have Considered Suicide / When
the Rainbow is Enuf," to be any
different from his previous works.
But it is. It's true that the gim-
micky color palette, with each
woman embodying a certain shade
of the spectrum, is so frustratingly
heavyhanded it makes you want
to throw something at the screen
every time a tear-stained char-
acter makes another reference to
a rainbow. And it's true that the
bizarre metaphysical monologues,
adapted from extracts from each
of Shange's 20 poems, can be rath-
er excruciating, especially as the
film whirls to a close. But it's also
true that there are moments in
"Girls" so poignant - so stagger-
ingly sad - that you might actually
find a tear unexpectedly slipping
out of your eye.
But this could just stem from the
content itself. Shots of a woman's
heartbroken face as her babies per-
ilously fall out of her eyesight, or
a shivering young girl hesitantly
bending her legs open to rid her-
self of an unwanted pregnancy
resonate with a rawness unseen in
much of modern cinema. At times,
the emotions on these women's
faces ring so genuine, they seem
positively Greek in nature, harken-
ing back to Sophocles's plays of pas-
sive heroines sheddingtears for the
deeds for which they were never
fully responsible.
or maybe the film's success
derives from the performances. As
the eight women slide in and out
of each other's lives - some only

ever. There's a Te Radio

transcending Dept.
quality to the Never
band's sound F
that's reflected Follow Suit
in its hazy atmo- Lahrador
sphere and wist-
fully melancholic lyrics. On the new
EP Never Follow Suit - a succinct
collection of five songs - palpable
nostalgia is evident through the
album's dreamy lo-fi production
and deliberately slow-paced and lei-
surely rhythm.
The Radio Dept.'s influences are
quite diverse, with band members
citing Joy Division, Frank Sinatra
ard Kraftwerk among the many
bands that have contributed to their
sound. The merging of those dispa-
rate influences gives the band an

inherently likeability - or, in other
words, the band sounds relatively
innocuous.
Consequently, The Radio Dept.
is very easy to listen to, but by no
means does it classify as an "easy-
listening" band mistakable for ele-
vator music. Still, there are no harsh
sounds or disjointed riffs. Lyrics are
incomprehensible but easy to guess
at. Half-formed murmurs imply
vague dissatisfaction and unrequit-
ed love. Trip-hop beats and shoe-
gaze influences meld seamlessly.
The album is cohesive, smooth and
mellifluous.
The EP clocks in atjust under 20
minutes, and two of the five songs
are variations of "Never Follow
Suit," a track off their LP Clinging
to a Scheme. Sure, it's a pretty good
song (fun beat, cool British person
rapping, etc.) but probably unde-
serving of consisting of almost half
of an EP - especially as it's already
featured on a previous album. The
lack of song diversity in the EP
makes Never Follow Suit seem like
a lazy endeavor. The last track,
a remix of "Never Follow Suit"

entitled "Never Swallow Fruit," is
a lengthy eight minutes and 14 sec-
onds and isn't much different from
the original. Although the EP is
brimming with promise and poten-
tial, it falls short of expectations.
Never Follow Suit is perfect for
providing beautiful, ambient back-
ground noise, which isn't surpris-
ing for a band that's already been

featured on a soundtrack. On the
soundtrack to the 2006 film "Marie
Antoinette," The Radio Dept.
accompanies the young queen's
taciturn listlessness and the pic-
turesque scenes of Versailles.
Consequently, it's no surprise that
Never Follow Suit lacks the emo-
tional depth that would vault the
EP from being a passive backdrop
to providing an active listening
experience.

playing peripheral roles to other's
storylines - they have little time
to be memorable. But memorable,
they are. Standouts include a feral1
Thandie Newton ("The Pursuit ofI
Happyness") ravenously assert-
ing her right to sex for pleasure,
a richly comedic Loretta Devine,
("Crash") as a condom-doling
nurse and a sunken-eyed Kerry
Washington ("Ray") asa child ser-
vices worker who just wants a baby1
of her own. But really, there's not
a misstep from the entire cast,
featuring Anna Wintour-like
magazine editor Janet Jackson
("Why Did I Get Married?"), bro-
ken housewife Kimberly Elise
("Diary of a Mad Black Woman"),
cult initiate Whoopi Goldberg
("Ghost"), dance teacher Anika
Noni Rose ("The Princess and the
Frog") and young hopeful Tessa
Thompson ("When a Stranger
Calls"). Together, these actresses
push past the overdramatic dia-
logue in order to portray women
truly afflicted with sorrows and
happiness.
But maybe, just maybe, a large
part of the film's effectiveness
comes from Perry himself. Say
what you want about the man's
lack of directorial subtlety, but he
manages to avoid many of the pit-
falls that could have arisen from
such a venture by letting the mate-
rial speak for itself. "For Colored
Girls" might be soapy or melodra-
matic - in fact, it's almost over-
whelmingly so - but Perry's vision
manages to cohere the unwind-
ing narratives. He doesn't hold
back from what he has to say, and
because of it, he shows his will-
ingness to experiment with the
medium, to varied - but mostly
successful - results.
"For Colored Girls" may forever
hold the stigma of an "Oprah's
Book Club" choice and, of course,
the stigma of being a Tyler Perry
movie (from which it will never
recover, unfortunately). But to
classify the work as another sad,

racially driven Perry film seems
unfair. Effective films are never
wholly defined by the director
behind the camera or the race of
the actresses onscreen, and despite
its unapologetic melodrama and
occasional disconnect from the
modern world, "For Colored Girls"
is an effectivefilm. Itmightnotwin
an Oscar because of it, but at least it
can go to sleep knowing it's better
than "The Blind Side."

SOHONI
From Page 6A
makes the scene memorable.
on a different level, Martin
Scorsese's "Goodfellas" has
numerous montages to classic
rock songs, including a masterful
extended Ray Liotta voiceover
montage under the piano exit of
"Layla" by Derek and the Domi-
nos. The song's lamentful, nos-
talgic and yet accepting decline
to a romantic affair perfectly
reflects its point in the film, as
the crime family culture of the
first two acts falls in bloody and
disastrous fashion, allowing nar-
rator and protagonist Henry Hill
(Liotta) to walk on (relatively)
unscathed but yearning for his
younger days.
Whenever I hear the piano exit
to "Layla," it's not that I see the
entire montage from Goodfellas;
the importance of the combina-
tion is that each form informs and
changes the other. For me, just as

much as "Layla" is an essential
part of "Goodfellas," the film has
become an essential part of my
experience of the song.
The same way that people
relive their memories to music,
my experience of music often
returns me to a film. That said,
music in film is more than math-
ematical and the combination is
far more than the sum of its parts.
Music combined with a visual
medium can change the way we
move, the way we respond to real
situations and most importantly,
the way we remember.
The human memory is enor-
mously complex; we can remem-
ber songs lyric-for-lyric that we
haven't thought of in years, and
in the same way, we can always
remember the essential combina-
tion between aural and visual
- whether that comes from our
own experience or through wit-
nessing another's in film.

of which went for touchdowns.
See HEROES, Page 3B Roundtree destroyed Jack Clan-

cy's 1966 record by 49 yards.
"Today was a great day,"
Roundtree said after the game.
"I really don't get into the stats
and stuff like that. I just make
sure if we score, we score again.
That's our motto on the offense ...
Everybody got to eat, and today,
we all had time with the ball."
Quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said after the game that they
saw weaknesses in the Illini sec-
ondary, and after a disappoint-
ing mistake in last year's game,
Roundtree was a big part of
exploiting those weaknesses.
In the Wolverines' devastat-
ing loss in Champaign last year,
Roundtree appeared to have a
76-yard touchdown, similar to
Saturday's first play. But after a
video review, officials ruled that
Roundtree was caught at the
Illinois 1-yard line. From there,
Michigan couldn't punch the ball
in on four straight tries, effective-
ly stopping the team's momentum
dead in its tracks.
This week though, Roundtree
told offensive coordinator Calvin

again.
"We teased Roy all week, I
don't know if he told you," Michi-

"Last year, he had a long one and

didn't get caught today... Calvin
was on the headset with me when
he caught the ball, and he says,
'Don't get caught this time, Roy,
don't get caught this time!' He
took off pretty well. He's a tal-

For Roundtree, most of his
record-setting performance took
place in the first half, when he
accumulated a staggering 192
yards on four catches.

Michi- MICHIGAN 2
gan field
hockey team, the only person
capable of topping her perfor-
mances seems to be, well, Rachael
Mack.
After scoring the game-tying
goal for the 11th-ranked Wolver-
ines in the Big Ten Tournament

semifinals Thursday against Penn
State, Mack notched the game-
winning goal in overtime that
sent Michigan to the finals. She
followed that up with the game-
winning goal in the finals to lift
the Wolverines to a 2-1 victory
and the Big Ten Tournament title
over No. 5 Ohio State on Sunday.
"It's just unbelievable," Mack
said Sunday, after being named
Tournament MVP. "Just to be
part of such a great team experi-
ence is just amazing."
Mack's goal against Ohio State
(5-1 Big Ten, 16-4 overall) came
in the 41st minute when redshirt
junior Katie Adams stole the ball
near the goal and sent a pass to

a cutting Mack on the near post,
who deflected it into the net.
"Oh my goodness, the game-
winning goal was outstanding,"
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz
said through the Athletic Depart-
ment. "Katie ... made a beautiful
reverse stick pass across the 'D'
and Rachael just got her stick on
it and really went hard to the ball
so it was a wonderful game win-
ninggoal."
Michigan's defense, led by
junior Hannah Dawson and
seniors Meredith Way and Paige
Laytos, stepped up as the team
clung to a one-goal lead for the
remaining 29 minutes amid a
Buckeye onslaught.

Redshirt junior goalkeeper
Christi Barwick recorded only
one save on the day, but it was a
vital one. After the ball leaked
through the Wolverine defense
with seven minutes remaining,
Barwick denied Ohio State senior
Aisling McKeon a game-tying
goal with a diving stick save.
"Ohio State, they're a fantastic
team," Pankratz said. "Their indi-
vidual skill sets are amazing and
so we were just trying really hard
to stay in front, play good defense,
and it took one, two, three, maybe
sometimes four of us to do it but
we got it done today."

never have the wings contributed so
directly to winning a game as they
did on Saturday on the road against
Alaska-Fairbanks.
Early in the third period with the

score tied at two, sophomore Chris
Brown put the puck on net. After
a series of deflections, the puck
bounced off sophomore center A.J.
Treais's helmet and into the net. It
turned out to be the winning goal.
"There's a first time for everything
I guess," Treais said Saturday night.
After trading goals throughout
the first two periods, Treais's goal
ignited No. 5 Michigan's third-peri-
od efforts. The Wolverines added on
two more to win, 5-2, Saturday in the
Carlson Center, rebounding from a
3-0 loss Friday.

It's time to go bowling..finally

it's been1,041 days.
That's 33 Michigan football
games (just 14 wins), 957 points
scored and 2,301,961 attendees at
the Big House.
That's once in two blue moons
(trust me, I checked).
That's how

I think we
can all agree
that it has been much, much too
long since the Wolverines have
experienced postseason football.
So for now, who cares that the
team's defense gave up 65 points
to a decent Big Ten offense.
Who cares that Greg Robinson
will probably get fired and Rich
Rodriguez could very well be
close behind him. Who cares that
Michigan might end up playing in
the Pizza, Pizza Bowl.
Because for one second, Michi-
gan fans, take solace in the fact that
something good happened to you.
You've gone through the worst of
times, the worst of the worst. So
you deserve this.

Remember, for most of you on this

I remember what it felt like my
freshman year, watching Chad
Henne tear up the Florida defense
in the Capital One Bowl, a game
that should have been a blowout
going the other way.
After a loss to Appalachian State
to open the season (and myytime as
a student), I felt like I could believe
in Michigan football again after
that win.
And though this win may not
be nearly as meaningful - they
still have a long way to go - there's
something to be said for triple-

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily SportsfEditor
Throughout this football
season, Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez has said over and
over again that
his extremely NOTEBOOK
young defense
would have to grow up quickly if
the Michigan football team was
going to be successful. But for
weeks, the progress of the young
players, especially in the second-
ary, has been painfully slow.
On Saturday, in Michigan's
67-65 triple-overtime victory over
Illinois, they finally grew up.
The Wolverine defense got
major contributions from many
underclassmen, especially from
redshirt sophomore linebacker
Kenny Demens.
Demens, who took over the
starting role from senior lineback-
er Obi Ezeh against Iowa, made
some huge plays against the Illini,
most crucially when the defense
was playing on a short field
because the Michigan offense
turned it over, which happened

four times on the day. in the game, Vinopal teamed up

But it's been the secondary that redshirt sophomore safety Jordan

Hemingway open for a touch-
down.
"That's what made me mad," he
said.
The turnovers often put the
defense into tough spots, but the
unit came through with flying col-
ors, especially after the two picks.
The defense forced a fumble after
the first interception and after the
second held the Illini to a field
goal.
And while the offense made up
for these lapses later in the game,
players on the defensive side took
pride having the offense's back
for once, and not the other way
around.
"It was amazing," sophomore
defensive end Craig Roh said. "I
felt like we were finally paying
them back a little bit."
But even though it all worked
out on Saturday, the coaches know
Michigan can't expect to make
that many mistakes and win.
"We can't turn the ball over,"
quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said. "I preach it everyday. Our
coaching staff preaches it every-
day. We cannot turn the ball over


and win on a consistent basis. It's
not going to happen, and that's
going to be corrected."
INJURY REPORT: Robinson
was not made available to the
media after the game, but when he
was injured at the end of the third
quarter, speculation turned from
a hand injury to a concussion.
After the game, Rodriguez said
the coaches decided to keep Rob-
inson out of the game because he
did show concussive symptoms.
"Denard got hit somewhere on
that last drive. I don't know if it
was the helmet-to-helmet - that's
probably where it was," Rodri-
guez said. "He was dizzy, had
a little headache. He had those
symptoms so certainly for his
safety, you're not going to put him
out there."
There is no official policy on
when Robinson would be allowed
to return if he did indeed suffer a
concussion. That decision will be
up to the Michigan medical staff.
Sophomore running back Teric
Jones was carted off the field very
early in the game and didn't play
the rest of the day.

man, he had a real good game
today."
Fellow wideout Darryl Sto-
num said Roundtree's perfor-
mance opened the field up for a

lot of other guys in the second
half - Hemingway especially.
With Illinois up by a touch-
down in the game's do-or-die
second overtime, sophomore
quarterback Tate Forcier's
third-down throw hit off an
Illinois linebacker's helmet and
bounced into Hemingway's

hands as he ran into the end-
zone.
"I was lucky," Hemingway
said. "He got in front. I wasn't
expecting the ball to get bat-
ted in the air because he swung
down. It just popped in the air
and I stayed with the ball and
just caught it."

The catch put the Wolver-
ines in triple overtime, where
they clinched the game on a
two-point conversion throw-
and-catch from Forcier to
Hemingway.
It was a fitting way to end
career days for Roundtree,
Hemingway and the entire

receiving corps.
"I'm very proud of them,"
Magee said. "Earlier, when we
were doing a lot of running in
the season, they were just doing
their jobs blocking. ... I always
knew they had those capabilities
and we wanted to start getting
them the ball."

ALASKA
From Page 1B
Treais, who had 13 points last
season, hadn't recorded a point
in nine games this season coming
into Saturday, but responded at a
time when the Wolverines needed
him. He played well defensively,
finishing plus-3, and scored three
points.
"It's just interesting how hock-
ey works that usually when you
have a good game, you're working
away from the puck, especially
the center because the center has
to do a lot of work down low in the
defensive zone," Michigan assis-
tant coach Billy Powers said. "It
was a good solid effort all around

for A.J., and I think it started with
his work ethic without the puck
and big things happened with it."
Treais's effort in the sec-
ond game was needed, because
though Michigan had a different
cast, with senior goaltender Bryan
Hogan playing both games due to
senior Shawn Hunwick having
a stomach bug, the game wasn't
any different from their previous
series openers. The Wolverines
(4-1-1-0 CCHA, 5-2-3 overall)
have now lost three straight Fri-
day night games and won three
straight Saturday games.
On Friday, the same
mistakes plagued Michi-
gan as in its previous two
weekends, as it could not
generate a lot of shots and

gave up an early goal.
In game one, No. 15 Alaska's
Cody Kunyk beat senior defense-
man Chad Langlais to the puck on
the backdoor after it deflected off
a skate and put it into the open net.
The goal came midway through a
first period in which the Nanooks
(3-2-1-1, 6-3-1) controlled the play
from the opening faceoff, out-
shooting the Wolverines 12-5, but
could only muster one goal.
"They got us on our heels
early," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said after Friday's game.
"Whether it was the penalties or

the turnovers, the first period the
chances were something like 12-2
(for Alaska). We were lucky to sur-
vive the first period."
That goal was all the Nanooks
needed, as their defensive style,
which had Alaska second in the
nation in goals against, suffo-
cated Michigan in the neutral
zone. Their style, combined with
a key 5-on-3 penalty kill midway
through the second and a few
unlucky post shots for the Wol-
verines, shut out Michigan for the
first time in 35 games.
As unlucky as Friday was with

hitting the posts, Michigan had
two goals, including Treais's, go in
off deflections on Saturday. Mich-
igan is now 1-2-1 on Friday nights
and 4-0-2on Saturday.
"I know it's been a little bit
of a trend on Friday, but this is a
unique deal," Powers said. "Com-
ing out on Friday, they just had
more jump and we didn't have our
legs. As the Friday game wore on
we were getting better and better
and I think it was just kind of get-
ting the travel fatigue or whatever
you want to call it out of your sys-
tem."

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN

MAIZE GAUGE,

The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Spread-o-Meter measures the success of quarterbacks, the Rod-o-Meter
iudges how emotional (positive or negative) Rich Rodriguez was following the game and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

4/4
Denards

Michigan quarterbacks combined for 419 passing yards,
and the Wolverines rushed for 257 yards. Most impres-
sively, the team hardly missed a beat after sophomore
quarterback Denard Robinson left the game with
concussion-like symptoms - especially in triple OT

4/
Rich Rods

At the press conference on Saturday, Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez couldn't have been happier that his
team clinched bowl eligibility for the first time in his
Wolverine tenure. Rodriguez also called the game's final
stop a "perfect ending" for his much-maligned defense.

HYPE-0-METER
3/4 The late-arriving crowd more than made up for alack-
luster first quarter with incredible enthusiasm through-
out the fourth quarter and all three overtime periods.
Big Houses Rodriguez said he relished the opportunity to win the
game on the student section side of the field.

With Michigan ahead 67-65 in the third overtime, Illinois had to
successfuly complete its two-point conversion to extend the game to
a fourth overtime. The Wolverines blitzed seven defenders, including
senior linebacker Jonas Mouton who came in unblocked from the right
side. On the defensive line, Michigan ran a stunt which left sophomore
defensive lineman Craig Roh with a clear path to Illinois quarterback
Nathan Scheelhaase. Mouton got to Scheelhaase first and Roh made
sure that he didn't get off a quality pass attempt, sealing the victory for
Michigan.
