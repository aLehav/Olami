FLINT, 
Mich. 
— 
Standing 

before a crowd of more than 1,000 
residents at Flint Northwestern 
High 
School 
on 
Wednesday 

afternoon, 
President 
Barack 

Obama reaffirmed federal support 
for the Flint community in the 
ongoing water crisis and eased 
mounting tensions surrounding 
the health of the city’s children and 
the safety of its drinking water. 

The president’s visit came in 

response to a letter written by 
8-year-old Flint resident Mari 
Copeny, also known as “Little 

Miss Flint,” for her work raising 
awareness of her community’s 
plight. Copeny requested to meet 
Obama while she was visiting 
Washington D.C. to attend a 
congressional hearing on the water 
crisis in April. Obama instead 
answered her letter by announcing 
last week that he would travel to 
Flint to meet with city residents 
and local and state leaders. 

The Flint water crisis began 

in April 2015 following the city’s 
cost-saving switch from Detroit 
city water to Flint River water. The 
water from the Flint River had a 
corrosive quality, which resulted 
in lead erosion in the city’s pipe 
system, tainting its water supply. 
In the weeks and months following 
the switch, residents reported 
adverse health effects, but their 
complaints were largely ignored by 
local officials until Oct. 2015, when 
the water was finally switched 
back. Despite the switch, traces of 
lead remains in the water due to 
the Flint’s already corroded pipes. 

In his remarks, Obama said the 

people of Flint have a right to be 

angry, blaming the water crisis on 
poor decisions and neglect from 
state and local officials. 

“Even though the scope of 

response looks sort of like what 
we’re used to seeing after a natural 
disaster, that’s not what this was,” 
Obama said. “This was a man-
made disaster. This was avoidable. 
This was preventable.”

Obama also implicitly rebuked 

Governor 
Rick 
Snyder’s 
(R) 

administration, saying the crisis 
represents a systematic problem 
in 
which 
efforts 
to 
shrink 

government undermine essential 
environmental 
protection 
and 

municipal services.

“It’s 
a 
mindset 
that 
says 

environmental 
rules 
designed 

to keep your water clean or your 
air clean are optional, or not that 
important, 
or, 
unnecessarily, 

burden businesses or taxpayers,” 
Obama said, charging that this 
small-government 
ideology 

undercuts the common good in 
favor of personal gain. 

“And this kind of thinking —

Sickouts over 

underfunding force 
closure of 94 school 
districts in Detroit

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

A sickout planned by the 

Detroit Federation of Teachers in 
the Detroit Public Schools system 
closed 94 of 97 DPS schools on 
Monday. The teachers organized 
the sickout in protest of the 
announcement that teachers will 
not be paid past June 30 of this 
year unless the state legislature 
approves funding to the district.

Judge Steven Rhodes, DPS’s 

state-appointed 
emergency 

manager, allegedly told the union 
on Saturday the state’s current 
budget does not allot nearly 
enough 
money 
for 
teachers’ 

salaries, summer school programs 
and special education services. 
The closure affected a majority 
of 
the 
approximately 
46,000 

students enrolled in DPS.

The sickout follows a series 

of similar protests last held in 
January against thedilapidated 
condition 
of 
many 
school 

buildings. Schools have reported 
instances of rodents, cockroaches 
and leaking ceilings in many 
buildings due to the lack of 
sufficient funding to address 
building maintenace. 

State Rep. Stephanie Chang 

(D–Detroit) said she is cautiously 
optimistic that her colleagues 
will pass a bill to alleviate these 
issues.

SACUA 
discusses
yearlong 
schedule 
with new 
members 
 

Mental health, faculty-

administration 

cooperation dominant 

issues

By LYDIA MURRAY

Summer Managing News Editor

The Senate Advisory Committee 

on 
University 
Affairs 
hosted 

its first meeting under the new 
leadership 
of 
Chair 
William 

Schultz, professor of mechanical 
engineering, naval architecture 
and marine engineering. During 
the meeting, new members were 
introduced, and the committee 

discussed topics for the upcoming 
year’s agenda, including mental 
health on campus.

New 
members 
to 
SACUA 

include Michael Atzmon, professor 
of 
nuclear 
engineering 
and 

radiological sciences; Radiology 
Prof. Ruth Carlos; and Social Work 
Prof. Robert Ortega.

Atzmon 
began 
working 
in 

faculty governance last fall through 

the Senate Assembly. He said he 
aims to communicate the positions 
of the faculty to the administration 
during his tenure on SACUA.

“One of the things I care about 

most is cases where administrative 
leaders forget what it is like to be in 
the trenches,” Atzmon said. “Our 
role is to remind them of what our 
values are.”

Carlos said she wants to increase 

the 
interaction 
between 
the 

Medical School and the rest of the 
campus community.

“The Medical School, because 

of its size and connection with the 
hospital, sometimes overlooks, 
in my opinion, its obligation to 
the campus at large,” she said. 
“I’d like to see more conversation 
between the two.”

Ortega was not present at the 

meeting.

During the meeting, Schultz 

provided a tentative agenda for 
the year, including the Office of 
Institutional Equity appeals — 
which 
handles 
discrimination 

and harassment complaints —, 
the tenure process — which 
has been a subjet of debate in 
previousmeetings 
— 
and 
the 

Standard Practice Guide, which 
is a set of policies made by the 
University of Michigan for faculty 
to follow. Schultz then opened 
up discussion for members to 
propose additional topics.

Former SACUA Chair Silke-

Maria Weineck, chair of the 
department 
of 
comparative 

literature and a German studies 
professor, suggested the addition 

of mental health of both students 
and faculty to the list.

She said mental health disorders 

should be treated with the same 
level of seriousness as other 
physical medical conditions.

“Depression and anxiety are 

illnesses,” Weineck said. “They 
should be treated like cancer … I 
don’t think they should be demoted 
to general unwellness.”

Students have recently been 

calling for improved mental health 
services 
on 
campus 
through 

discussions with the Board of 
Regents and events aimed at raising 
awareness for the issue.

Pharmacy Prof. David Smith 

raised concern over the overlap 
between faculty mental health 
and the Fitness for Duty policy, 
which ensures faculty members 
are able to perform the duties of 
their positions as part of the SPG. 
He said he wanted to make sure no 
one is unfairly laid off because of 
this clause.

“(I want) to make sure that 

nobody who suffers from this kind 
of illness is going to be removed 
because of Fitness of Duty,” he said. 
“It’s not going to be abused.”

Carlos suggested adding other 

staff members to the discussion 
to address the mental health of 
residents in the Medical School.

The members also discussed 

upcoming guest speakers, including 
Central 
Student 
Government 

president David Schafer and vice 
President micah Griggs, LSA rising 
seniors, who plan to meet with 
SACUA later in May.

City Council passes budget 
despite resident comments 

$370 million budget 

represents $10 
million decrease 
from previous year 

By BRIAN KUANG

Summer Daily News Editor

Ann Arbor’s $370 million bud-

get for the 2017 fiscal year was 
subject to a public hearing at 
Monday’s City Council meeting at 
Larcom City Hall. At the meeting, 
city residents also expressed their 
opposition to two local develop-
ment projects for fear of damaging 
wetland ecosystems and increas-
ing flood risk to adjacent areas.

The 
2017 
budget 
includes 

an approximately $10 million 
decrease in expenditures as well 
as the addition of seven full-time 
employees, increasing the total 
city staff from 722 to 729. The bud-
get additionally includes $35,000 
to study non-lethal alternatives to 
the city’s controversial deer cull 
and $50,000 to implement recom-
mendations for police oversight 
reform that were approved in 
March.

Many residents commented on 

specific items of the budget, rang-

ing from calls for improving the 
city website to improve accessibil-
ity to City Council documents to a 
proposed organic waste disposal 
program.

The $35,000 provision for a 

study on non-lethal deer manage-
ment options drew attention from 
a number of public commenta-
tors opposed to the deer cull, who 
reaffirmed their opposition to the 
city’s annual lethal deer cull.

When Ann Arbor was plan-

ning its deer management strat-
egy from 2014 to 2015, non-lethal 
options were considered but ulti-
mately ruled out for lack of sci-
entific basis. The lethal cull of 
63 deer was a controversial and 
polarizing decision for many city 
residents.

Robert McGee, an Ann Arbor 

resident opposed to the cull, called 
for the city to continue to uphold 
its promise to explore non-lethal 
deer management, offering to 
start a fundraising drive to cover 
the costs of such a study for the 
city.

“Let Ann Arbor once more be a 

leader,” McGee said. “Let’s unite 
this community behind something 
positive, and let’s benchmark non-
lethal methods for deer manage-
ment in the state of Michigan.”

Residents also voiced their 

opposition to the proposed Wood-
bury Club Apartments project on 
Nixon Road. The project was orig-
inally proposed to Council in 2014, 
but its approval has been repeat-
edly postponed due to opposition 
from residents over concerns that 
the project would damage sur-
rounding floodplains and increase 
flooding risks in adjacent areas.

Eric Lipson — a local attorney 

challenging incumbent Graydon 
Krapohl (D–Ward 4) in the 4th 
Ward City Council race — said 
new development should not take 
precedence over the safety of 
existing residents, which would 
be threatened by the Woodbury 
project.

“Just for the sake of tax base, 

we are allowing ourselves to flood 
those other people who’ve been 
paying taxes for years and years,” 
Lipson said. “Now we’re going 
to build on the floodplains … it’s 
going to come back and bite us.”

Noting that a public meeting to 

finalize the apartment plans was 
held in 2014 without proper notice 
to all relevant local stakehold-
ers, Councilmember Sabra Briere 
(D–Ward 1) motioned the issue be 
postponed with the unanimous 
support of the body until a new 
public meeting could be held with 
proper notice to nearby residents.

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor attends a City Council meeting at Larcom City Hall on Monday.

this myth that government is always 
the enemy; that forgets that our 
government is us — it’s us,” Obama 
said. “That attitude is as corrosive 
to our democracy as the stuff that 
resulted in lead in your water.”

Obama then stressed the residents 

of Flint are being heard, reassuring 
them the American people as a whole 
are paying attention to the city.

“I want all of you to know I am 

confident that Flint will come back,” 
he said. “I will not rest, and I’m going 
to make sure that the leaders, at every 
level of the government, don’t rest 
until every drop of water that flows 
to your homes is safe to drink and 
safe to cook with and safe to bathe 
in — because that’s part of the basic 
responsibilities of a government in 
the United States of America.”

Rep. Dan Kildee (D–Flint), Sen. 

Debbie Stabenow (D–Mich.) and 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver spoke 
before Obama gave his remarks. All 
three expressed their gratitude for 
Obama’s work to help the citizens 
of Flint and his decision to visit 
and learn more about the crisis but 
acknowledged there is more to be 
done.

Weaver said while many positive 

steps have been taken to make the 
water better and safer, major health 
concerns still exist in Flint.

“I hope after the president’s visit 

here today everyone will see the 
priority of helping to fix Flint,” she 
said. “It has to be a priority: fixing 
Flint. We are moving in the right 
direction on the road to recovery, 
and we all know that Flintstones are 
resilient. We didn’t deserve what 
happened here, but we do deserve 
the resources to fix it.”

On Jan. 16, President Obama 

declared a state of emergency for the 
state of Michigan, ordering federal 
aid to fund state and local emergency 
response efforts to aid the Flint 
community. This followed a massive 
increase in national media spotlight 
on the crisis after Hillary Clinton 
mentioned the issue in a Democratic 
debate in January.

Obama 
has 
taken 
additional 

measures in response to the water 
crisis in his expansion of funding 
for Medicaid, Head Start — a 
federal government organization 
that prepares children from low 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 

for school — and local Health 
and Human Services centers, in 
addition to water testing by the 
Environmental Protection Agency, 
according to the White House. 

Prior to Obama’s remarks, Snyder 

also addressed the crowd, facing 
a vociferously negative response. 
Snyder apologized for the crisis 
and promised to work to resolve it, 
recieving boos from a majority of the 
crowdmembers. 

“Let me begin by saying I 

understand why you’re angry and 
frustrated,” he said. “I wanted to 
come here today to apologize … I 
want to work hard to fix that.”

Citing criminal negligence of 

government officials in response to 
the crisis, several groups of protesters 
have called for the resignation of 
Snyder over the past six months. 
Both Secretary Clinton and her 
rival in the Democratic nomination 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–Vt.) have 
also called for Snyder’s resignation. 
On April 20, Michigan Attorney 
General Bill Schuette charged three 
Flint officials in relation to the crisis, 
excluding Snyder.

Protesters with the Flint Lives 

Matter movement gathered across 
the street from Flint Northwestern 
High School hours before his arrival, 
calling for an increased federal 
response to the crisis.

Flint resident Gary Byas, who 

participated in the protest, said he 
wants the government to provide 
funds to replace all of Flint’s lead 
pipelines.

“We want to get clean water, to 

get water rates lowered, to make 
sure they are putting in new pipes 
instead of trying to coat them,” he 
said. “We have rusty pipes — why 
are you trying to coat them? When 
they are rusted out from the inside 
out, it’s not doing much good. We 
need replacement of the pipes, and 
that’s why I’m out here — to get the 
right amount of money to replace all 
the pipes.”

During 
his 
time 
in 
Flint 

Wednesday, Obama additionally met 
with community members, local 
and state leaders — including Snyder 
and Weaver — and federal officials 
handling the response to the water 
crisis. 

In 
response 
to 
community 

fears and skepticism of the safety 
of filtered water, Obama assured 
residents that the filtered water is 
safe to drink for all people who are 
above the age of six, excluding those 
who are pregnant. To emphasize 
his point, Obama drank a glass of 
filtered Flint water both durin his 
meeting with community leaders 
and in the middle of his remarks.

“So although I understand the 

fear and concern that people have, 
and it is entirely legitimate, what the 
science tells us at this stage is you

MANAGING EDITOR

420 Maynard St. 

Ann Arbor, MI 48109

 tothedaily@michigandaily.com

Edited and managed by students at 

the University of Michigan since 1890.

I 

attended Commencement to 
support the seniors in my 
life who’ve taught me to be 

critical of the 
world and try 
to 
change 
it 

for the better. 
However, 
hearing 
Michael 
Bloomberg 

talk 
about 
microaggressions, 

trigger warnings and safe spaces 
reminded me of the confidence 
with which many rich, white men 
speak 
on 
experiences 
they’ve 

had the privilege to never go 
through. In a single speech in 
front of thousands, Bloomberg 
demonstrated an incredible lack of 
understanding of the experiences 
of those with underprivileged 
identities — experiences that many 
of his policies as mayor of New 
York City help create.

“The fact that some university 

boards and administrations now 
bow to pressure groups and shield 
students from these ideas through 
‘safe spaces,’ ‘code words’ and 
‘trigger warnings’ is, in my view, 
a terrible mistake,” Bloomberg 
stated 
after 
reiterating 
the 

importance of college to introduce 
students 
to 
“challenging 
and 

uncomfortable” ideas.

In regards to what Bloomberg 

called “one of the most dangerous 
places on a college campus” — the 
safe space — I’d like to ask Michael 
Bloomberg if he has ever attended 
one. Bloomberg claimed these 
spaces were unsafe because they 
create “a false impression that we 
can insulate ourselves from those 
who hold different views.” As an 
Arab-American on this campus, 
I’ve been to several and can attest 
to 
the 
difficult 
conversations 

that 
occur 
with 
individuals 

from all backgrounds. The term 
‘safe’ includes psychological and 
physical safety, which is necessary 
for the kinds of conversations 
Bloomberg claims to value. How 

can such conversations take place 
in spaces where marginalized 
groups do not feel accepted and 
remain silent from fear?

Bloomberg mentioned trigger 

warnings as a conversation hurdle. 
Trigger 
warnings, 
preferably 

called “content warnings,” are 
part of a courteous society that 
acknowledges the pain found in 
others’ experiences. If I want to 
have discussions on sensitive topics 
that might cause another person 
significant pain, I’d inform them 
so they can prepare themselves 
in order to take care of their well-
being. If that means they choose 
to leave a conversation or activity, 
so be it. I may not share those 
experiences and cannot rightfully 
police how they respond. 

“A microaggression is exactly 

that: micro,” Bloomberg said, 
minimizing 
microaggressions’ 

impact. I have never been New 
York City’s mayor and will not 
comment on what it’s like to 
have chosen to increase police 
forces and surveillance of Muslim 
communities, implement policies 
like “stop-and-frisk” or to hold 
a legacy policing people of color, 
and likewise, Bloomberg should 
have recognized he was out of line 
to comment on experiences he has 
never had when he’s responsible 
for policies contributing to them.

Growing 
up, 
I 
dealt 
with 

microaggressions 
insinuating 

I wasn’t fully American and 
requiring I consistently explain I 
do not support terrorism. Dealing 
with microaggressions from a 
young age has made questioning 
everything about how I present 
myself to the world second nature 
— if I do or say this, am I hurting 
or helping those who share my 
identity? Microaggressions are 
not micro for those forced to deal 
with them. To Bloomberg, we 
can’t and shouldn’t try to prevent 
microaggressions “in politics or 

in the workplace.” Why should 
we not expect that we treat our 
fellow 
humans 
with 
respect? 

Bloomberg seems to care only for 
the privileged groups’ comfort at 
the marginalized groups’ expense.

While I was left with a bitter 

taste on my tongue, Bloomberg 
did have some positive messages 
in his speech — urging students 
to get involved in politics by 
voting and demanding more from 
their leaders. Many commend 
Bloomberg for his speech’s content 
because he was “brave” and not 
afraid 
to 
challenge 
“political 

correctness.” At a time when 
the University of Michigan has 
actively promoted their Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion campaign, 
Bloomberg’s speech stood out 
like a sore thumb on an important 
day for many. Individuals can 
have 
conversations 
on 
issues 

like police brutality and gender 
inequality without being hateful. 
It is important to recognize some 
of these issues are “topics of 
conversation” to you, but “topics of 
one’s own life” to another. 

“Oh, but that’s not how the 

real world is?” True — many 
would never claim such a thing. 
The world isn’t a utopia with no 
“-isms.” Many do not want to take 
responsibility of their privileges 
and dismantle the institutions 
and 
systems 
granting 
them. 

Individuals who’ve always been 
marginalized are still bogged 
down with forms of injustice 
morphing 
throughout 
history. 

We will use the spaces where 
future generations are educated to 
create a culture of mutual respect, 
awareness and acknowledgement 
of how our differences impact our 
lived experience. While Bloomberg 
feels change in the way we treat 
others is impossible, I know it isn’t.

Privilege blooms for Bloomberg

ROLAND DAVIDSON | OP-ED

Safe spaces deserve discusson

Last week, Michael Bloomberg 

spoke to graduates about a number 
of issues, including our nation’s 
widening 
political 
divide, 
the 

importance of dedication and the 
deleterious effects of safe spaces. 
With many of these matters, there is 
a deep generational divide between 
our views and those of our parents. 
This break was particularly salient 
in Bloomberg’s discussion of safe 
spaces, which he characterized 
as serving to shield students from 
ideas which they find controversial. 
Myself, and many students within 
the social justice community here, 
would disagree with this sentiment. 
I believe that safe spaces are essential 
for creating meaningful dialogue, 
but they do come with caveats.

I was fortunate enough to take 

a course in criminology under 
Sociology Lecturer PJ McGann. 
Toward the end of the semester, we 
spent a number of classes discussing 
sexual violence. Nearly 30 percent 
of undergraduate women reported 
experiencing 
nonconsensual 

penetration or sexual touching by 
force or incapacitation during their 
time at the University of Michigan. 
So there were definitely students 
who had firsthand experience in 
our 100-person lecture. McGann 
was conscientious of their needs 
and let our class know that if anyone 
needed to step outside at any point 
over the course of the lecture, they 
were welcome to. This helped create 
an environment where we could 
earnestly listen and discuss one of our 
campus’ and nation’s most pressing 
issues. If a student were reliving past 
trauma, how could they be expected 
to engage in a class discussion? Safe 
spaces allow for students to effectively 
engage with controversial ideas.

Similarly, when students are taught 

to recognize how people of color are 
often tokenized in academic spaces 
and how to stop this behavior, we can 
have more fruitful conversations about 
racial justice. This can additionally help 
alleviate the psychological burden that 
comes with being the only person of 
your race in a room, an experience that 
many of my friends are all too familiar 
with. As a white person, I can count on 
one hand the number of times that has 
happened to me. Safe spaces help place 
students of all backgrounds on equal 
footing.

There are, however, legitimate 

grievances 
against 
safe 
spaces. 

In the New Yorker article “The 
Trouble with Teaching Rape Law” 
Harvard Law Prof. Jeannie Suk 
writes, “I often assign students roles 
in which they have to argue a side 
— defense or prosecution — with 
which they might disagree. These 

pedagogical tactics are common to 
almost every law-school topic and 
classroom. But asking students to 
challenge each other in discussions 
of rape law has become so difficult 
that teachers are starting to give 
up on the subject. About a dozen 
new teachers of criminal law at 
multiple institutions have told me 
that they are not including rape law 
in their courses, arguing that it’s 
not worth the risk of complaints of 
discomfort by students.” Clearly, 
this is problematic. Without proper 
training, how can we expect our 
society to successfully fight against 
endemic sexual violence? A safe space 
is meant to engender a sense of comfort 
without permitting students to avoid 
essential learning.

Earlier this semester, the University 

hosted Milo Yiannopoulos and Julie 
Bindel for a debate entitled “From 
Liberation 
to 
Censorship: 
Does 

Modern Feminism Have a Problem 
with Free Speech?” The duo has been 
banned from universities throughout 
the 
U.K. 
for 
their 
purportedly 

transphobic opinions and the effect 
that their presence may have on the 
campus environment. I think that this 
is inappropriate. Universities are meant 
to be bastions of open discussion, and 
to not invite guest speakers because 
of 
their 
convictions, 
particularly 

when those convictions aren’t even 
the subject of discourse, hurts our 
intellectual integrity. This is one of 
the few cases where an adherence 
to protecting campus climate has 
damaged a University’s commitment 
to intellectual excellence.

There 
isn’t 
a 
dichotomous 

relationship between safe spaces and 
earnest 
discussion. 
Furthermore, 

to paint the creation of a safe space 
as an inevitably slippery slope to the 
maladies which they have carried 
in the past is disingenuous. On the 
whole, they enhance those essential 
conversations and, frankly, we could 
do with more safe spaces at the 
University. But there are definitely 
cases where unyielding dedication 
to making students feel comfortable 
has proven destructive, and to ignore 
these examples undermines how 
important safe spaces are. A safe 
space’s effectiveness largely depends 
on its implementation. All of this 
warrants a broader discussion about 
the limits of safe spaces, where they 
should be located and who should 
be responsible for making sure they 
are upheld. But that all starts with 
breaking down the false binary that 
Michael Bloomberg and others have 
created.

ELISE JAYAKAR | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

I grew up hiding behind my 

mom’s light, long legs at grocery 
stores, burying my head into the 
cart-made skid marks and hoping 
no one pointed at the spectrum 
that lay between our skin. Meijer 
was terrifying. I worried that my 
big-hearted mother would again be 
labeled my “nanny” by some lady 
juggling a box of Cheez-Its and 
toilet paper. Even today, I can still 
feel the sting of the word “nanny” 
branded onto my mother’s heart, in 
the same way that it did mine.

As I grew older, I learned to man-

age. I maneuvered my way through 
the fruits and vegetables aisle 
without shame. I let my sassy first-
grade confidence lead me. No one 
dared to hurt me again. I thought 
my poise and our matching bouncy 
laughs would discourage strang-
ers from dividing us because my 
mother and I have the same cheeks, 
smile and heart. We speak the same 
language of love above all else. She 
taught me how to make lasagna 
and friends, and to love your family 
before yourself.

But Meijer became my enemy 

again when I was in middle school. 
The day that I became afraid of my 
best friends coming along to the 
grocery store was the same day I 
lost hope in strangers. Once again, 
I began to doubt intentions and 
replaced admiration with jealousy. 
My best friend’s skin tone always 
matched the same porcelain color 
of my mother’s, and another ordi-
nary shopper would tell my mother 
that “her daughter” is beautiful or 
how they look so much alike during 
checkout. They were never talking 
about me and my brown skin. So 
I stood at the empty cart, empty-
hearted and betrayed by the soft 
“thank you” my mother returned. 
I wondered why I was so easily 
forgotten. I wondered when race 
became the thing that could so easy 
divide us as family.

The divide split deeper. I noticed 

how “being tan” was only beautiful 
if you were olive after a thick hot 
sun. I noticed how bushy eyebrows 
meant nerdy, dirty, unkempt. How 
white boys never liked brown girls. 
I noticed that my body would never 
be lusted over with its dark skin and 
round features. My crooked middle 

school smile broke when I was 12 
and a boy made fun of the dark hair 
on my legs. A hairy Indian could 
never be desirable and half white 
only counts when you have green 
eyes and porcelain light skin. My 
prepubescent mind didn’t under-
stand much, but it knew that Lizzie 
McGuire was what was beautiful: 
blond hair and striking blue eyes. 
Those eyes, the blond hair and the 
hairless legs were the same eyes, 
hair and legs of all the friends 
around me. I have dark, tangled 
hair. My left eye is brown while my 
right is almost black, and my knees 
and elbows are chalky.

The same question of race 

becoming the thing that so easily 
divided us crossed my mind when I 
was 17 and applying to colleges. You 
see, they have added new boxes for 
race like “Asian/Pacific Islander,” 
“Native American” and “Other,” 
but I cannot squeeze so easily into 
any of the demographics listed. 
I cannot simply click one. I was 
never South Asian enough to press 
down on “Asian/Pacific Islander.” 
My whiteness doesn’t show in my 
skin; only in the way I learned how 
to cook and celebrate birthdays. 
And why should I press down on 
the “other” button when strangers 
at the grocery store do that for me 
anyway?

Again, 
the 
same 
question 

recurred, stripping me down to 
only bone. A prickly-bearded boy 
walked up to me in the basement 
of some bar just to ask me where 
I came from. I politely responded 
with Sri Lanka and India in my soul 
and United States soil as my home. 
The boy smirked, his lips tightened. 
“Sri Lanka is just another part of 
India,” he announced selfishly. 
“You’re American.” Lately, I’ve 
been learning how to stand up for 
myself, to be more than docile and 
submissive. Tell me why I always 
have to prove where I am from. 
Tell me why my words are never 
enough.

Again, last summer, my plump 

professor bellowed, “So, are you 
Hindu or Muslim?” I told him I 
am Christian, my family is Chris-
tian, but he couldn’t comprehend 
how such tanned skin could be so 
“American.” Christianity is usually 

synonymous with white. But my 
whiteness is not what embodies my 
religious beliefs. My grandfather 
— a balding Indian man with thick 
skin and a love for spice so sizzling 
it burns your mouth — is the most 
devout Christian I know.

Yesterday, a white girl giggled 

a big bubbly laugh while stating, 
“How typical for an Indian family!” 
after I described the hard work my 
family has persevered through. 
A family with a white mother, a 
Sri Lankan and Indian father, and 
three kids with mocha skin. I’ve 
started to learn that my family 
isn’t easy for people to gather. How 
could the same family who bakes 
chocolate chip cookies and makes 
sticky windowpane candy also stir 
a perfectly spiced chicken biryani? 
 

I am not brown enough. I am not 
white enough. I am not American 
enough. I am not enough to navi-
gate this perpetual negotiation of 
my soul and body, though I’ve tried 
so hard to fit in.

My parents didn’t see me for 

the slur of confusion that I am. 
My friends never understood the 
constant identity crisis of an entire 
culture expressed in my skin yet 
unfound in my heart. Who do you 
go to when being brown is mean-
ingless and you want it to be mean-
ingful? The desi community labeled 
me as white girl, and it hurts in 
places no mono-racial person could 
ever understand.

I can’t find my people so easily. I 

don’t even know who my people are. 
Are they the Americans who don’t 
understand their melting-pot coun-
try? Are they the ones who eat their 
grandmother’s coriander shrimp 
curry swept into their mouths with 
their hands? Or are they the ones 
who always have “other” stamped 
on their brave hearts when they 
take surveys? Those people, though 
their skin is multi-dimensional, 
have never been from the same 
mix of lands that I am from. I have 
never met someone with identi-
cal white, Sri Lankan and Indian 
parallels. There has not been one 
day that I have mastered my mixed 
identity, but I refuse to hide from 
the grocery store any longer.

OPINION

Brown and white and never enough

F

our years ago this March, my 
mom passed away. She was 
terminally ill, so we knew for 

a few months 
beforehand 
what was going 
to happen to 
her. It was suf-
ficient time to 
come to terms. 
Now I know 
not 
everyone 

has that cour-
tesy when they 
lose their loved 
ones — in a very morbid way, I was 
lucky. I was able to say my goodbyes 
before I lost her.

Not everyone knows about her 

passing either. People ask me about 
my parents, and I usually just answer 
with some information about my dad. 
Sometimes people follow up with 
“And your mom?” which I then have 
to answer with something about how 
she passed away. It gets awkward 
because people feel terrible for press-
ing for more information and begin 
apologizing profusely.

Death is inevitably sad, but I don’t 

want anyone’s pity. I understand to 
apologize is just the natural reac-
tion to hearing about someone los-
ing their loved ones, but it’s not your 
fault. Through an apology, you’re 
implying you feel bad for me. When 
I tell you, it’s because it’s an integral 
part of who I am.

I’ve grown up and experienced 

“firsts” differently than people who 
had both parents, like my first day 
of college and my first terrible break 
up. I’ve adapted, though, and learned 
how to talk to my dad in a different 
way than most women my age. It has 
made me a very different person than 
I would’ve been had she still been 
here. Her death has also strength-
ened and made my relationship 
with my dad incredibly important. 
He really is my best friend and con-
fidant. Who knows what it’d be like 
if she hadn’t passed away. But in an 
inexplicable way, I have to be grate-
ful.

There is no avoiding the subject 

at times, and at others, I often find 
myself wishing I could just bring it 
up in casual conversation without 
everyone cringing. By feeling bad 

for me, it just reinforces the sadness 
that comes along with losing a par-
ent. I have lived every day since she 
passed without her, some days being 
harder to get through than others. I’ll 
continue to live my days without her. 
After a while, I became “used” to her 
being gone.

There has only been two times 

that I’ve talked about her outside of 
my family where I didn’t feel sad. 
Once when I was talking to my ther-
apist, and once when I was casually 
speaking to a friend. Both times, they 
asked what she was like. They want-
ed to know who she was and how she 
impacted me. They asked about her 
as if she was still very much a part of 
my life, which she is, without a doubt. 
I think about her at least once a day 
and, if we’re being honest here — 
with fear of sounding a little crazy — 
I talk to her sometimes. Whether it’s 
on the pages of a journal I keep or just 
in my head as I’m walking around 
campus, it’s comforting to me to act 
as though she knows what I’m up to 
and everything I’ve accomplished.

Remembering she was a very piv-

otal part of my life and asking me 
about her time with me makes me 
feel good. It’s a nice way to celebrate 
everything she did for me when she 
was here and brag to everyone how 
much I’m like her. Hardly everyone 
ever asks, so I never get to tell them 
about how I got my insatiable sense 
of adventure from her as well as her 
big blue eyes. They’ll never know 
about how she could never cook for 
less than 20 people. Or how her idea 
of a “midnight snack” was opening a 
tub of Cool Whip, pouring sprinkles 
on top and eating it like ice cream.

These little things about her make 

me smile. It reminds me of a time 
when I wasn’t watching her fight 
her illness. I can’t speak for everyone 
who has lost a parent but, at least for 
me, don’t be afraid to ask what she 
was like. I love remembering her in 
happy times. Her death is but one 
blip on an entire 16 years I was able 
to spend with her. There’s no need to 
dwell on one moment that makes me 
sad when I have thousands of others 
that make me want to smile.

ARTIST PROFILE

‘Ahead’ a fake 
but lively biopic

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

This spring is starting to feel like 

a music biopic-heavy season in the 
middle of a music biopic resurgence. 
Some, like “Amy,” 
have 
master-

fully 
captured 

the torment and 
hardship of their 
troubled 
stars, 

while others, like 
the forthcoming 
“Nina,” have sac-
rificed substance 
for controversy.

So, how exactly did star, writer, 

director and producer Don Cheadle 
(“Flight”) make his storyline stand 
out in a genre where sex, drugs and 
rock ‘n’ roll (or in this case, jazz) are 
the norm? Easy — he made it up. 
It’s a risky move. Historical purists 
and Miles Davis biography junkies 
aren’t going to love it, but for the less 
historically inclined, the fiction is a 
pleasant departure from a genre that 
struggles with filling space between 
the music.

What emerges from this blend of 

fact and fiction is an idea of Davis — 
namely Cheadle’s idea of him. In that 
sense, the film is less about Davis as 
a person and more about Davis as 
a cultural icon. To Cheadle (and I 
think to many of his fans) it doesn’t 
matter what Davis did on any given 
day, but rather what he made and 
what that product meant to the mil-
lions of people who listened to and 
loved his music.

The exchange of plot points for 

deeper significance sounds wonder-
ful, and in “Miles Ahead” it almost 
is. But unfortunately Cheadle doesn’t 
know how to stop his fantasy version 
of Davis from running wild. One of 
the film’s standout scenes — a gun-
filled car chase — feels more like an 
outtake from Davis’s guest appear-
ance on “Miami Vice” than a scene 

in a serious and artistic film about 
his life. The scene sucks the romance 
out of Cheadle’s impressionistic por-
trayal and leaves it feeling childish 
and absurd.

Narratively, the film follows a 

familiar strategy of throw-in-a-
journalist-and-a-story-will-emerge. 
Dave Brill (Ewan McGregor, “The 
Force Awakens”) is a writer at Roll-
ing Stone tasked with writing Davis’s 
“comeback story.” While his exis-
tence in the film — much like Jesse 
Eisenberg’s in “The End of the Tour” 
— is in part a vehicle through which 
to ask the questions Davis would 
never answer unprompted, it works. 
The two have chemistry — so much 
chemistry, in fact, that at times the 
film seems headed for buddy cop ter-
ritory.

While “Miles Ahead” may not be 

the film that solidifies Cheadle as 
a master storyteller, it could be the 
one that solidifies him as a master 
behind the camera. With the help of 
editors John Axelrad and Kayla M. 
Emter, Cheadle edits the film to the 
beat of Davis’s fragmented music. 
Flashback’s are cut side by side with 
current-narrative progression in a 
rhythm that in any other film would 
feel jarring. But, when set to Davis’s 
music, it feels natural and reminds 
the audience why we’re all here: 
not because someone named Miles 
Davis got in a fight at Columbia 
Records one time, but rather because 
someone named Miles Davis made 
amazing music with enough power 
to inspire a filmmaker to dedicate 
ten years of his life to immortalizing 
him. 

So maybe “Miles Ahead” is a pur-

ist’s nightmare, and maybe even for 
impressionist fans it dips too far into 
cartoon territory; but, love it or hate 
it, one has to acknowledge the love 
and passion that Cheadle eskews for 
his muse every moment he’s in front 
of the camera and every moment he’s 
behind it.

Student talks life and

Aash Mehta discusses 
EDM beginnings in 

Ann Arbor.

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Arts Writer

There’s 
the 
GarageBand 

geek from high school, or the 
kid who has been locked in 
his dorm room for a couple of 
days now, or your old next-
door neighbor who always had 
the speakers bumping a little 
too loud: what’s their least 
common denominator? They’re 
characters of an allegory of 
our millennial generation who 
are most likely spitting out the 
following phrase on a regular 
basis: 
“Hey, 
check 
out 
my 

SoundCloud.”

You can’t blame these artists. 

You can’t blame them for their 
need to self-market, their desire 
to get the word out about their 
ongoing projects or their drive to 
beat out all the others in the fight 
for relevance and recognition. 
The music industry is saturated 
with original artists right now, 
recording and producing tracks 
in the comfort of their own 
computers and sending them 
into the Internet’s universe. So 
with much of the same thing and 
so many options to choose from, 
it’s easy to doubt, and it’s even 
easier to become immediately 
overwhelmed.

Aash Mehta, a graduating 

senior at the University of 
Michigan, had to make the best 
of poor industry conditions. It 
began in high school, following 
the voice changes of puberty, 
when Mehta decided that the 
sappy acoustic guitar (and such) 
weren’t completely for him. 
He decided, instead, to take on 
something that had turned him 
on for so long: electronic music.

Mehta spent high school in 

India, where an excess of actual 
musical variety exists. Holding 
residence in a cultural epicenter 
like India gave him an early 
understanding of world music: 
K-pop, 
German 
electronic 

and pop and a host of others 
that many must search much 

harder and longer for. So with 
a little more cultural depth 
and a lot to pull from, Mehta 
downloaded “anything free from 
the Internet” and took a stab at 
electronic music.

“When I began I put a lot of 

mixes up on my SoundCloud. 
I would just plug into my 
computer, DJ live and then put 
up those mixes. A lot of people 
nowadays don’t always do that, 
but I’ve always preferred to do it 
live. I spent hours out of the day 
on YouTube, trying to learn new 
techniques and such, but the 
problem is, you can have a mind 
for how you want it to sound 
like, but for the longest time you 
won’t have the ability to put it on 
paper or on a computer. I had to 
work at it and get better in order 
to create what I actually wanted 
or thought that I wanted.”

So 
in 
January 
of 
2015, 

after having learned a lot and 
practiced more, Mehta purged 
his 
SoundCloud 
of 
all 
its 

previous content. He erased his 
past mixes and projects for the 
Internet to never know. With an 
appreciation for genre-bending, 
Mehta started in on something 
different. He started in on 
something a little more fun, a 
little more different and a little 
closer to the artist he wanted to 
be.

“Where some kids in my class 

are saying: ‘Oh, I made this app!’ 
I’m sitting there saying, ‘Oh, 
hey I made this sick beat!’ I’m 
not doing Computer Science, my 
major, after college. I’ll probably 
move to Los Angeles, get a part-
time job and pursue my music 
career on a basically full-time 
basis. I do think of it analytically, 
like I do think that there is some 
mathematical wave to it all, and 
you kind of need that with beat 
matching” Mehta said.

“My remix to White Lies by 

Odesza was something that got 
me a lot of recognition, and I 
think that that was the first 
track where I thought: ‘I’m 
going to do my own thing with 
this song, even if people don’t 
like it,” and then I sent it out to 
a couple of blogs— a whole long 
list of them — and that got a ton 
of plays and listens,” Mehta said. 

Mehta has been able to tap 

into the electronic music scene 
of Detroit as well. The interna-
tionally-renowned 
electronic 

artist 
Elephante 
recognized 

Mehta not long ago in a connect-
ing moment not uncommon for 
electronic musicians.

“I opened for Elephante’s 

show in Detroit, and he played 
his unreleased single during his 
set. After he gave permission I 
remixed it, sent it to him and got 
his approval,” explained Mehta. 
“And now I’ll be putting it out 
at the end of May. It’s cool that 
people are getting to know what 
my sound is like and then getting 
their approval on it at the same 
time. It’s an awesome process, 
and I’ll be having a lot of content 
coming out as it all happens.”

There is something precious 

to Mehta’s beats, something 
genuine and organic that would, 
from an objective perspective, 
appear out of place among the 
masses. Writing his own lyrics, 
matching manufactured tones 
and sounds to the intangibles 
— it’s a medicinal, provoking 
process. It’s collecting what 
you know, and have known, and 
growing upon what you then 
want to create on your own.

“Most people think that a lot 

of my sounds are instrumenta-
tions or beats that I have made, 
but a lot of them are vocal drops 
that I have messed with on my 
computer to make them sound so 
weirdly different,” said Mehta.

Mehta is working towards 

something 
in 
Los 
Angeles, 

where the recording artists and 
producers range in variety, style 
and power. With a job to pay the 
bills on the side, the University 
graduate is taking his talents 
to the West Coast in search of 
something a little bigger, a little 
more. Mehta is standing among 
the army of millennial musi-
cians, those that must fight 
amongst the battlefields of the 
unending Internet for relevance 
and recognition. But he’s got it: 
with the connections and almost 
one million hits on SoundCloud, 
Mehta is onto something. He’s 
using a popular platform to work 
for himself, as most innovators 
must and do.

‘Views’ fails to impress

ALBUM REVIEW

Despite all the hype, 
Drake fails to deliver 

what’s expected.

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

‘Views’ is a concept. It was incept-

ed by a tweet in 2014, and subse-
quently swelled over two years into 
a commercial force 
spanning minimal-
ist billboards and 
predictable 
Snap-

chat filters. Before 
the 
album 
was 

even released, fans 
called it a classic 
based on singles 
“Hotline Bling” and 
“One Dance,” in addition to a confi-
dent assertion by Drake himself.

That confidence was on full dis-

play just prior to the album’s release, 
as Drake gave a rare interview with 
the ever-enthusiastic Zane Lowe on 
Apple’s Beats 1 Radio. He seemed at 
ease with himself, sounding more 
secure than ever. To add visuals 
to his boasts, he posted a string of 
meticulously staged photos through-
out the release of Views — a perfect-
ly-poised husky, a well-puffed fur 
coat, a Mad Men evoking combina-
tion of suits-and-whisky.

But, as is often the case when the 

line that separates commercial prod-
ucts and albums is blurred, Views 
shines more brightly as an idea than 
an actual body of work. This is not 
to say that this is necessarily a bad 
album. The run from opening track 
“Keep the Family Close” to “Hype” is 
Drake at his very best: the production 
is transcendent, the vocals are (as 
claimed during the Zane Lowe inter-
view) at Drake’s highest level yet and 
his flow feels more under-control 
than ever. All the classic Drake-isms 
are covered in this streak — catchy 
hooks, a love for Toronto, nostalgic 
reminiscing and so on.

The Kanye-produced track, “U 

With Me,” is a particular standout. 
Drake weaves between what he 
knows well, talking of texting mind 
games — “3 dots, you thinking of a 
reaction still” — and shade — “fuck 
them stories, fuck the shade they 
throwing.” The beat churns and 
claps, well in-sync with the hook and 
the verses, and the third verse reach-
es a level that seems like it should 
have all along, as Drake’s voice soars 

with anger.

It’s unfortunate, because this 

trend begins to fall off after only a 
few tracks, giving way to frustrat-
ing inconsistency. “Faithful,” the 
center of the album, meanders with 
its redundancy, an adjective that 
describes the rest of the album all 
too well. During the Zane Lowe 
interview Drake explained that the 
album moves thematically from 
“winter, to summer and back to win-
ter again” to reflect Toronto weather, 
but that theme doesn’t feel much 
apparent here, nor does it justify the 
lack of focus that plagues these later 
tracks. There are Caribbean dance-
hall tracks that Drake has shown 
an increasing interest in, first with 
his feature on Rihanna’s “Work” 
and later with standout single “One 
Dance.” Some, like Rihanna col-
laboration sequel “Too Good,” suc-
ceed, while others, like “Controlla,” 
feel unnecessary and almost boring. 
On the other hand, there are beat-
heavy bangers, ranging from weak 
ones, like the What a Time to Be Alive 
continuation “Grammys,” to better 
ones, like “Pop Style.” If you thought 
these would line up along that appar-
ent winter-summer-winter theme, 
you would be wrong — they vary 
throughout, with little sense of cohe-
sion.

Ironically, the rapper’s release 

If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late 
from last year is a far more consistent 
and directional work, though Drake 
declared it a “commercial mixtape” 
and apparently never thought of it as 
a cohesive album. Still, that release 
towers over this one.

Perhaps this is on account of an 

increasingly obvious lyrical discon-
nect within Drake’s music. Tracks 
like Too Late finale “6PM In New 
York” and So Far Gone closer “Fear” 
succeeded because of the clear-
headed assessment they gave after 
the mistakes Drake made, both 
in his life and on his tracks. That 
unabashed venting has given him 
breathing space, room to explain his 
ups and downs, his questionably con-
descending view of his love interests 
and his goals. But Views is so harshly 
regressive in its tone on women that 
it’s more difficult than ever to forgive 
the borderline misogyny. Sure, he 
briefly acknowledges his hypocrisy 
on “Redemption,” questioning “Why 
do I want an independent woman 
to feel like she needs me? / I lost my 
way,” but more often than not the 
arrogance is fully internalized.

Questionable 
language 
about 

women is no doubt common in rap. 
But Drake is a special case in that 
he actually believes he’s the good 
guy here, placing the women in his 
life as his enemies, rather than enti-
ties as many rappers do. It’s classic 
nice-guy syndrome. Nowhere is this 
clearer than “Child’s Play,” whose 
namesake is all too fitting. In the first 
verse he claims “Momma is a saint, 
yes she raised me real good,” twist-
ing this into an explanation as to why 
he should be even more of an asshole: 
“All because of her I don’t do you like 
I should.” The complete delusion he’s 
cultivated is unappealing at best, and 
outright offensive at worst. Rapper 
Killer Mike may offer us some choice 
words on the matter: “... she raised a 
bunch of fuck boys, next time do bet-
ter.”

Regarding the rest of the album: it 

varies little in tone. Those final clari-
ty-revealing assessments like “Fear,” 
once prominent and forgiving in 
Drake’s music, are gone here. Closer 
“Views,” which would have once 
fulfilled this role, gives the listener 
no such satisfaction — the boasts are 
less enjoyable, and the man is, frank-
ly, far less easy to sympathize with.

Does any of this really mat-

ter? Probably not. Drake is king 
of “meme” rap, working in “What 
are those?!” references and sub-
liminal Meek Mill disses to please 
the masses. It’ll surely make the 
internet crazy. Not even a day after 
Views’s release and comments on 
Rap Genius were already filled with 
excited gifs and rows of fire emojis. 
One commenter summed up the 
worship well: “10/10 Album, only 
Real Day 1 Fans will understand 
& vibe to this Amazing brand new 
album that Drake created for our 
ears. #Views.” There’s no room for 
discussion here — Drake could have 
released nearly anything, anything, 
and still have been praised.

You could argue he deserves it. 

He has marketed and branded him-
self so well over the last few years 
that it would have been a surprise 
for this not to have happened. Some 
were caught off guard by the ferocity 
of “Back to Back” or his collabora-
tion with trap king Future, but these 
moves were calculated and planned 
far in advance. His videos, his music, 
even his Instagram seem meticu-
lously constructed to elicit the most 
traction possible from rap fans who 
describe albums in terms of “Tweet-
ability” and determine the quality of 
a work by the standard of fire. And 
for that, Drake sits king.

OVO Sound

L’chaim, ‘Broad’

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

In the season three finale of 

“Broad City,” our favorite Jewesses 
took off to see the Holy Land. In an 
episode filled 
with 
drug 

smuggling, 
makeshift 
tampons and, 
of 
course, 

sexual 
she-

nanigans, the 
dynamic duo 
made saying 
goodbye 
to 

“Broad City” 
for the summer virtually impos-
sible. 

Ilana (Ilana Glazer) and Abbi 

(Abbi Jacobson) capitalize on a 
free trip to Israel through Birth-
mark, based on the real-life Birth-
right program, which sends young 
adults to Israel with a mission 
statement to advance the Jewish 
bloodline. With plenty of stereo-
types to use as inspiration, Abbi 
and Ilana take full advantage of 
their Jewish heritage to deliver one 
of the wittiest episodes of “Broad 
City” yet. With plenty of yamakas, 
Ivy-league rivalries and pita bread 
to go around, the finale is every-
thing you would expect from a 
plane full of Jewish bachelors and 
more. Unapologetically candid and 
always to be watched with a hearty 
sense of humor, the finale was able 
to poke at underlying societal issues 
without ever sacrificing a comical 
nuance.

The majority of the episode 

is filled with a desperate hunt 
for a tampon. Of course, “Broad 
City” will use any and all oppor-
tunities to make a feminist 
statement, and when the topic 
of women’s health comes into 
play, the girls don’t hold back. 
While Ilana’s revelation that all 
tampons should be free digs at 
the patriarchy, Abbi’s interac-
tion with an older woman high-

lights the underrepresentation of 
menopause on mainstream tele-
vision. This unfiltered discus-
sion of everything “woman” is 
intentionally at the center of the 
series’ content, a way for Glazer 
and Jacobson, both the show’s 
stars and creators, to express 
their opinions and interjections 
in today’s media-obsessed cul-
ture. A discussion of gender is 
never censored as virtually every 
episode confronts some sort of 
feminist issue.

Season three was filled with 

celebrity appearances, most nota-
bly Hillary Clinton who made her 
iconic cameo on episode five. The 
finale did not disappoint, as Adam 
Levine was featured as a pilot in 
the in-flight safety video which, 
unlike in real life, everyone was 
paying attention to. The impres-
sive list of guest stars that have 
graced “Broad City” is a testa-
ment to the show’s relatability 
and influence on the pop-culture 
landscape. Since its first season, 
the series has grown and flour-
ished, gaining a loyal cult fol-
lowing that includes some of the 
biggest names in Hollywood.

Perhaps what makes “Broad 

City” a must-see is the way Ilana 
and Abbi are able to observe and 
comment on millennial life. Sure, 
two girls with fine arts degrees 
trying to make it in New York City 
is nothing groundbreakingly orig-
inal, but somehow the duo is able 
to make the most relatable things 
inexplicably hilarious. Whether 
it be a conversation about how 
Jesus is really just the hot rich kid 
or the societal influence of Drew 
Barrymore’s suitcase, the content 
is nuanced, relevant and appli-
cable to anyone with even the 
slightest interest in pop culture. 
It’s going to be a long and tough 
summer without the queens, so 
for the time being we’ll be inces-
santly stalking the “Broad City” 
Instagram for some comical gold.

Preference for 

sweets can predict 
childhood obesity 

By MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

New 
University 
research 

shows a childhood preference 
for sweet foods may be a 
predictor of unhealthy weight 
gain.

According to the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention, 
over 
one-sixth 
of 
children 

and adolescents were obese in 
2012, which translates to about 
12.7 million individuals. Over 
the past 30 years, childhood 
obesity has more than doubled 
in children and quadrupled in 
adolescents.

Childhood obesity is also 

correlated to adult obesity. 
Obesity increases the risk of 
developing 
many 
different 

health 
problems 
including 

cardiovascular 
disease, 

diabetes and many types of 
cancer.

Julie Lumeng, an associate 

professor 
of 
pediatrics 
at 

the University, and her team 
recently published a study in 
Pediatrics 
medical 
journal 

describing 
the 
correlation 

between 
childhood 
eating 

habits and weight gain.

Lumeng 
said 
childhood 

obesity 
is 
a 
major 
public 

health issue, but it is not 
well-addressed. According to 
Lumeng, the current methods 
to curb the problem — which 
primarily focus on emphasizing 
healthy eating and exercise — 
are not effective.

“Childhood 
obesity 
is 
a 

significant 
public 
health 

problem, but there are few 
people to study it specifically in 
relation to children’s behaviors 
at very young ages,” Lumeng 
said. 
“The 
strategies 
for 

obesity prevention that we use 
right now are not particularly 
effective. We need to find 
new ways to intervene, and 
this might be a novel point for 
intervention.”

The team asked mothers to 

feed their toddlers of ages from 
birth to two years a typical 
lunch and then offer their 
children a plate of sweet and 
salty treats. The team observed 
that 
children 
who 
were 

offered sweet treats preferred 
increasingly 
sweeter 
food 

as they grew older and were 
more likely to be overweight. 
This correlation was not seen 
for children who elected salty 
snacks.

Their findings suggest some 

people may be more prone to 
obesity than others and that 
food preferences from very 
young age can determine the 
likelihood of obesity later in 
life.

“The findings suggest that 

children just have different 
predispositions 
to 
certain 

eating 
behaviors,” 
Lumeng 

said. “Parents may need to be 
particularly 
vigilant 
about 

limiting children’s access to 
sweets when their children 
have a particular love for 
sweets.”

Lumeng said the results of 

the study may act as a key step 
in 
understanding 
childhood 

obesity. 

“There 
could 
be 
many 

biological factors contributing 
to children’s food preferences,” 
Lumeng said. “It’s important 
to actively notice what foods 
children chose because it could 
be a key predictor in unhealthy 
weight gain as they grow 
older.”

The entire study took five 

years to complete. Lumeng 
and her team hope to follow 
the children in her study into 
adulthood to see if their eating 
behaviors in early childhood 
could predict future obesity.

tooth correlates

New facility improves 
and de-stigmatizes 

mental health care for 

young patients 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Nyman Family Unit for Child 

and Adolescent Mental Health and 
Wellness, a new pediatric inpatient 
psychiatric unit within C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital, opened April 4. 
The unit is a structural and techno-
logical improvement from the previ-
ous unit located 
in 
the 
Health 

System’s old chil-
dren’s hospital. 

Construction 

of the unit, which 
began 
about 

three years ago, 
was funded both 
by the Univer-
sity of Michigan 
and a donation 
from 
psycho-

therapist Jo Elyn Nyman. The unit 
can accommodate up to 16 pediatric 
patients through the age of 17.

Ben Biermann, inpatient director 

for child and adolescent psychiatry, 
said the old psychiatric unit needed 
improvements to provide the spe-
cialized type of care young patients 
need.

“It’s an inpatient unit for treat-

ing kids and adolescents who have 
a serious psychiatric illness,” Bier-
mann said. “Most of the kids who 
are admitted to the unit are there 
because there’s a safety concern. 
These are kids who have severe 
depression and are feeling sui-
cidal, or who have psychotic symp-
toms, or who are having significant 
behavioral disturbances or other 
dangerous behaviors such as eat-
ing disorders or substance abuse. 
It’s a safe place for those kids to get 
assessed and treated and get a safe 
transition to outpatient care.”

Nursing 
Supervisor 
Nicole 

Figueroa said the new unit has an 
increased focused on creating a 
healing environment than the old 
unit.

“It’s really important to have a 

state-of-the-art unit for patients, 
particularly pediatric patients, with 
mental health diagnoses because it 

is a stigmatized group of patients 
and a lot of other institutions are 
older or they haven’t put a lot of 
thought into the design, so having 
a place where kids can really heal 
with their family around creates the 
best healing environment for the 
patient and their family,” Figueroa 
said.

Biermann 
echoed 
Figueroa’s 

sentiments, saying the unit aims to 
decrease the stigma associated with 
mental illness.

“Children and adolescents do 

struggle with psychiatric disorders 
just like their adult counterparts,” 
Biermann said. “Having the unit in 
the children’s hospital, along with 

all 
the 
other 

patients 
receiv-

ing 
medical 

treatment, does 
a lot to erase 
stigma, to bring 
psychiatric 
dis-

orders and men-
tal health issues 
to public aware-
ness.”

According to 

Biermann, 
hav-

ing the pediatric psychiatric unit in 
Mott is advantageous for interac-
tions with other departments. 

“The fact that we’re right in the 

children’s hospital makes it easier 
for us to get consultation from the 
medical services and makes us 
more accessible to our pediatric col-
leagues who might need our help 
with their patients,” Biermann said.

Biermann 
added 
that 
there 

are additionally many structural 
improvements in the new unit, 
including the larger size and visibil-
ity of patients. 

“It is much more functional. 

There are some important safety 
features, like a lot of the sight lines 
that are used to be able to look up 
and down the hallway and see where 
the patients are, are improved. In 
the old unit, there were a lot of hid-
den spaces, and the shape of the unit 
didn’t lend itself to being able to see 
where the patients were,” Biermann 
said. 

According to Biermann, the new 

unit can accommodate families who 
want to stay over with their chil-
dren. It also has improved work-
spaces for staff members, doctors 
and nurses as well as a separate area 
for patients who need particularly 
intensive care. 

Both Biermann and Figueroa said 

thus far the unit has received posi-
tive feedback from both patients and 
their families and has been operat-
ing at full capacity since its opening.

“We have a large hospital at U-M 

that cares for kids and so, to have 
also this unit that is caring for kids 
within the bigger institution, that 
just shows U-M’s great commitment 
to outstanding psychiatric care and 
mental health care as a whole for the 
University,” Figueroa said.

Biermann said those who lead 

the unit are happy with its improve-
ments but are in the process of mak-
ing further additions, such as hiring 
more staff members to improve the 
delivery of care and bring more 
specified care to patients. The 
unit additionally aims to continue 
improving parental and family 
involvement int he care process. 

“The University of Michigan can 

serve as a model of excellence for 
inpatient psychiatric care,” Bier-
mann said. “I think we provide 
state-of-the-art care, and now we do 
so in a state-of-the-art environment 
and are pretty cutting-edge in terms 
of the services we have.”

The University Health System 

and psychiatric unit staff is current-
ly discussing what will be done with 
the previous unit.

New children’s psych unit 
invites positive feedback

MARINA ROSS/Daily

Flint resident protests Gov. Rick Snyder (R) outside of Northwestern High School in Flint, MI.

FLINT LIVES MATTER

“Having the unit 
in the children’s 
hospital...does 
a lot to erase 

stigma”

and we need legislation to both 
pay the debt and make sure that 
there are structural changes as 
well,” Chang said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily. “The 
Detroit Democrats — I and my 
colleagues — have been working 
really hard for 
a while now 
on trying to

changes. 
We

and make sure that we get some

Union 
Interim 
President 

Ivy Bailey railed against the 
forecasted suspension in pay in 
an e-mail sent to union members 
on Monday.

“There’s a basic agreement 

in America: When you put in a 
day’s work, you’ll receive a day’s 
pay. DPS is breaking that deal,” 
Bailey wrote. “Unfortunately, 
by refusing to guarantee that we 
will be paid for our work, DPS is 
effectively locking our members 
out of the classrooms.”

Rhodes is the most recent 

state-appointed 
emergency 

manager, 
following 
the 

resignation of Darnell Early, who 
faced much criticism over both 
his handling of DPS and the city 
of Flint, where he also acted as 
emergency manager during the 
water crisis. DPS has been under 
an emergency manager since 
2009 and has been operating 
under a deficit of $515 million.

In March, Gov. Rick Snyder 

signed a bill 
to appropriate 
DPS 
$48.7 

million so the 
district could 
stay open until 
June 30. He 
said he hopes 
to 
continue 

efforts 
to 

find 
a 
more 

permanent 
solution. 

“I 
will 
continue 
working 

with lawmakers on a long-
term solution to restructure 
debt and direct more resources 
towards the classroom,” Snyder 
said in a statement. “Certainly 
today’s news is another sign of 
how urgently that solution is 
needed.”

Snyder 
further 
criticized 

the sickouts on a visit to Flint 
Monday morning.

“That’s not a constructive 

act with respect to getting 
legislation through,” he said.

Bailey told Fox Detroit that 

teachers should not be expected 
to report to schools on Tuesday.

Sophomore forward 
Chatman to transfer 

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Close to two months ago, Kam 

Chatman hit a game-winning 
three pointer against Indiana 
that propelled the Michigan 
men’s basketball team to the Big 
Ten Tournament semifinals and 
the NCAA Tournament.

It appears that will be the 

most memorable moment of the 
sophomore forward’s career in 
Ann Arbor.

As first reported by ESPN’s Jeff 

Goodman and later confirmed 
by 
the 
athletic 
department, 

Chatman 
will 
transfer 
from 

Michigan. He becomes the third 
member of the 2014 recruiting 
class to leave, joining Ricky 
Doyle and Aubrey Dawkins. His 
decision leaves the Wolverines 
with 
two 
open 
scholarships 

for the 2016-17 season and a 
noticeable lack of depth at the 
forward position. 

“Kam is a wonderful young 

man with the potential to mature 
into a fine college player,” said 

coach John Beilein in an official 
press release. “We have enjoyed 
coaching him over the past two 
years and wish him nothing but 
the best.”

Added Chatman: “I honestly 

don’t think I could have had a 
more quality life experience 
than I did in Ann Arbor. I am 
incredibly grateful for my two 
years at Michigan. I would 
like to thank Coach Beilein 
and his entire staff for taking 
a chance on a small town kid 
out of Portland. I know my 
experience has inspired others 
as I will take all of my lessons 
learned to continue my pursuit 
of becoming the best man and 
player I can.”

Chatman came to Ann Arbor 

as a much-ballyhooed recruit, 
ranked by ESPN as the No. 38 
player in his class.

He quickly earned a starting 

position at the beginning of his 
freshman year. But as the season 
went on, he found less and less 
playing time, and by the time the 
2015-16 season rolled around, he 

had fallen behind other players 
in Beilein’s bench rotation.

After playing in 32 games and 

starting 15 while averaging 15.2 
minutes per game his freshman 
season, Chatman played in 28 
games his sophomore season but 
started just two of them while 
averaging 7.2 minutes per game, 
a sharp decrease from his first 
season.

“(Kam) spent the first two 

years (spending) a lot of time 
sitting down in the bench with 
us,” Beilein said in the aftermath 
of the Indiana game. “But he’s 
‘Yes sir, no sir,’ working hard 
every single day, trying to grow 
his game. And for him to be 
rewarded with that big shot, with 
that moment that he will always 
be remembered for, is worth it 
for me knowing he has done such 
a great job of handling all of his 
adversity of not playing.’’

And for better or worse, that 

shot that saved the Wolverines’ 
season will be a reminder of what 
Chatman’s career at Michigan 
could’ve been.

Michigan to hire 
Donlon, Washington

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

After 
losing 
two 
assistant 

coaches to head coaching jobs, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s coaching staff makeover is 
underway.

In a move 

first 
reported 

by the Detroit 
News 
and 

ESPN’s 
Jeff 

Goodman and 
later confirmed 
by the athletic 
department, 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein has hired Oakland assistant 
coach 
Saddi 
Washington 
and 

former Wright State head coach 
Billy Donlon to fill the vacancies on 
his staff.

The coaching change is the first 

for the Wolverines in six years, 
with Beilein and assistants LaVall 
Jordan, Bacari Alexander and 
Jeff Meyer making up a steady 
foundation that guided Michigan 
to 
five 
NCAA 
Tournament 

appearances. But, pursuing what 
Beilein 
called 
“long 
overdue” 

opportunities, Jordan accepted the 
head coaching job at Milwaukee 
a month ago, and Alexander was 
hired by alma mater Detroit two 
weeks later.

“We are forever grateful for 

the fine work that LaVall Jordan 
and Bacari Alexander brought 
to our program over the past six 
years,” Beilein said in an official 
statement. 
“Their 
departures, 

however, have opened up a 
great opportunity for our staff 
to grow. Billy Donlon and Saddi 
Washington are exactly who I felt 
we needed to be able to continue 
our success and compete for more 
Big Ten championships.”

Beilein had mentioned in recent 

weeks that he would be looking 
for fresh ideas and defensive-
minded coaching from his new 
assistants, and he hopes Donlon 
and 
Washington 
can 
provide 

exactly that.

Both new hires also bring 

a wealth of experience to the 
table. Washington, who played at 
Western Michigan, has served on 
Oakland’s staff for 10 years and 
has worked as both the recruiting 

coordinator 
and 
post 
players 

specialist. Recently, he helped 
Oakland 
land 
under-recruited 

5-foot-9 guard and Detroit native 
Kay Felder, who led the nation in 
assists last season and was fourth 
in scoring before declaring for the 
NBA Draft this offseason.

“Saddi 
and 

I have known 
each 
other 

since his days 
at 
Western 

Michigan 
when I coached 
against 
them,” 

Beilein 
said. 

“We have also 
talked a lot of 

basketball in my nine years at 
Michigan. Saddi is an outstanding 
teacher of the game, and I love that 
he can coach multiple positions.

“He 
has 
established 
great 

relationships as a recruiter both in 
and out of the state of Michigan. 
His poise and presence remind me 
of LaVall, and I know he will be a 
great asset to our program.”

Donlon, meanwhile, spent 10 

seasons at Wright State, working 
as an assistant coach for four years 
before being promoted to head 
coach in 2010. As head coach, 
Donlon led the Raiders to a 109-94 
record but was fired in March. Like 
Washington, he crossed paths with 
Beilein as a player when his alma 
mater, UNC-Wilmington, played 
against Beilein’s Richmond teams 
in the late 1990s.

“I have known Billy for almost 

two decades, and I love his passion 
and IQ for the game,” Beilein said. 
“He has tremendous experience as 
a player, assistant and head coach at 
the Division I level. Improving our 
defense is a huge goal for us, and 
defense is one of Billy’s specialties. 
He is also excellent in skill 
development, and that has been a 
key to our success at Michigan.”

The announcement came as 

the first incoming move in what 
has been an offseason of attrition 
for the Wolverines. In addition 
to the departures of Jordan 
and Alexander, Michigan lost 
four players as transfers: senior 
guard Spike Albrecht (Purdue), 
sophomore guard Aubrey Dawkins 
(Central Florida), and sophomore 
forwards Kameron Chatman and 
Ricky Doyle (undecided).

Ferlic qualifies for 
U.S. Olympic Trials

By ORION SANG 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

When Mason Ferlic reached 

the finish line of the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase at the Payton Jordan 
Invitational last Sunday, the first 
thing he did was look up at the 
scoreboard.

And when he saw that he had 

finished with a time of 8:28.77, he 
couldn’t help but feel discouraged.

“I 
was 
actually 
frustrated, 

because I thought I had missed the 
standard by less than a second,” 
Ferlic said. “I was disappointed 
and pretty down on myself, and 
(Michigan assistant) coach (Kevin) 
Sullivan was telling me that I still 
did great and still had the collegiate 
lead.”

Ferlic had hoped to qualify for 

the U.S. Olympic Trials by finishing 
with a time under the U.S. Olympic 
Standard, but his time was 0.77 
seconds too slow.

Or so he thought.
After 
the 
race, 
Ferlic 
was 

congratulated by other competitors, 
and while he initially assumed 
it was in response to him setting 
the NCAA personal record, it was 
actually because he also came under 
the Olympic standard, which had 
been recently changed from 8:28 to 
8:30.

“It wasn’t until about 20 minutes 

(after) that finally one of the coaches 
was like, ‘No, you got it, it was 8:30,’ 
” Ferlic said. “We didn’t believe him 
until we pulled it up on our phones. 
That was a nice mood-booster. 
Originally I crossed the line and 
wasn’t pleased with the race, but 
then I found out I hit the standard 
and went from feeling mediocre to 
feeling pretty awesome about it.”

For Ferlic, the result was the 

culmination of a career’s worth of 
work and preparation. But even he 
didn’t initially expect to experience 
such success.

Earlier in his competitive career, 

Ferlic aimed for smaller objectives, 
such as just making a Big Ten team. 
As he checked these off his list and 
continued to improve throughout 
his career at Michigan, he realized 
there was potential to achieve even 
more.

“If you had asked me the same 

question last year, if that was a 
reasonable goal, I would have 

probably said no,” Ferlic said. “But 
as I’ve improved, recently it has 
become a very realistic goal of mine.

“I look back at it and realize I’ve 

been making these huge jumps and 
leaps, and the run at the trials is 
something that I’m ready for and 
it’s a great opportunity. I feel like I 
can compete with anyone and that 
I have a legitimate shot to be one of 
the three Americans to go to Rio for 
the steeplechase.”

For 
Ferlic’s 
two 
primary 

coaches, his finish at the Payton 
Jordan Invitational was somewhat 
expected.

“I actually thought he was 

ready to run an 8:25,” Sullivan 
said, who is also head coach of the 
men’s cross country team and has 
worked extensively with Ferlic all 
year. “He’s a touch off that time. 
Running 8:28 was within the range 
of what I expected. I was hoping he 
was gonna be somewhere between 
the 8:25 to 8:30 range, and so from 
that standpoint we accomplished 
what we were looking to do this 
weekend.”

Added Michigan men’s track and 

field coach Jerry Clayton: “He’s 
had a really excellent year. Just 
one race after another, he’s just 
really stepped it up. Went on (the 
distance medley relay team) and 
ended up (an) All-American at the 
indoor nationals. With what he ran 
last weekend, we really felt that he 
had those capabilities, and coach 
Sullivan has done an outstanding 
job with preparing him to run at 
that level.”

Ferlic’s next task will be to 

continue his ascent to the top. 
Plans for him are to sit down with 
Sullivan and craft a plan that will 
prepare him for both the upcoming 
NCAA Championships and the U.S. 
Olympic Trials in July.

He certainly recognized the 

significance of what he has done 
and what he might accomplish in 
the coming months.

“To represent Michigan and be 

the one wearing the ‘Block M’ is 
huge,” Ferlic said. “I’m representing 
an institution that over my five years 
has given a lot to me, so I feel this is 
a way to give back, to represent it at 
the highest level.”

‘M’ wins CWPA title, 

reaches NCAA tourney 

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Summer Managing Editor

In just his second year at the 

helm of the Michigan women’s 
water polo team, coach Marcelo 
Leonardi took a plunge into the 
water as a champion.

When he rose to the surface, 

his players continued to jump 
into Blodgett Pool at Harvard 
University in Cambridge, Mass. 
Junior goalkeeper Emily Browning 
held up a GoPro, ready to capture 
the moment that came next: the 
singing of the “The Victors.”

For 
the 
first 
time 
since 

2010, the Wolverines won the 
Collegiate Water Polo Association 
championship — their sixth title in 
program history — with a 9-2 rout 
of No. 13 Indiana. With Sunday’s 
victory, Michigan earned a bid to 
the NCAA Tournament, where it 
will face No. 9 Arizona State on 
Friday in Los Angeles, Calif.

Wednesday, 
the 
Wolverines 

also jumped ahead one spot in the 
CWPA national rankings to tie 
with the University of California at 
the No. 4 spot, Michigan’s highest 
ranking in program history.

“We’ve accomplished one of 

our major goals, which was to win 
(the 
conference 
championship) 

and qualify for NCAAs,” Leonardi 
told MGoBlue after Sunday’s win. 
“It feels a little bit surreal, because 
we feel like we still have unfinished 
business to do. But at the end 
of the day, we brought home a 
championship back to Michigan.” 

Though the Wolverines lost 

to the Hoosiers in the CWPA 
semifinals in each of the last two 
seasons, including an overtime 
loss by only one point last year, 
Michigan exercised its demons this 
time around.

On April 2, the Wolverines (7-0 

CWPA, 29-6 overall) stole the 
show in Bloomington, downing 
Indiana (6-1, 23-7) by three points 
in the rivals’ sole regular-season 
match. One time wasn’t enough, 
however, 
as 
Michigan 
still 

needed to reverse the Hoosier 
curse that has prevented it from 
making an even deeper dive into 
the postseason.

Luckily for the Wolverines, they 

did exactly that Sunday behind a 
season-high 13-save performance 
by senior goalkeeper Julia Campbell 
and an aggressive offense led by 

freshman driver Kim Johnson.

In front of Campbell was an 

impenetrable defense that made 
it difficult for Indiana to make it 
more than halfway down the pool. 
Michigan prevented the Hoosiers 
from tallying their first goal until 10 
minutes into the matchup, and the 
Wolverines’ power-play defense 
held Indiana to only one goal on 
eight extra-man opportunities.

After Campbell held Indiana 

scoreless for the third quarter, the 
Hoosiers netted one last goal in the 
final frame, but it was insignificant. 
Michigan held Indiana to just two 
goals, tying the fewest goals allowed 
in the CWPA final since Hartwick 
downed the Wolverines, 5-2, in the 
2004 CWPA championship game.

Meanwhile, Johnson anchored 

Michigan’s offense with her first-
career hat trick, earning her the 
distinction of the tournament’s top 
rookie to go along with her Rookie 
of the Year honor. As for senior 
attacker Ali Thomason, she was 
named the CWPA Tournament 
MVP with eight goals, four assists 
and eight steals in three games.

The conference championship 

is not only the first title for each 
current Michigan player, but it is 
also the first for Leonardi, who 
had won a gold medal with the 
USA Youth National Team before 
coming to Ann Arbor.

With one championship now in 

the books for Michigan, another 
still lies ahead.

Friday, the Wolverines will face 

Arizona State, which earned one 
of three at-large bids, in the first 
round of the NCAA Tournament. 
Michigan last matched up with 
the Sun Devils at the Arizona State 
Invite on March 19, when then-
No. 9 Arizona State defeated the 
Wolverines, 8-5. , Michigan holds a 
2-5 record against all nine teams in 
this year’s NCAA field.

Overall, the Wolverines are 5-9 

in the NCAA Tournament and 
have never survived a first-round 
matchup, so Friday’s game will 
be a true test for this year’s squad. 
Michigan’s last NCAA Tournament 
appearance ended with a sixth-
place finish in 2010, and its most 
successful showing came with a 
fourth-place finish in 2002. 

Given 
how 
quick 
Leonardi 

has turned the program around, 
Michigan has high potential for the 
weekend ahead.


‘M’ Softball Academy 
provides perspective

By ORION SANG 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Just like the last series against 

Penn State, this weekend’s series 
against Rutgers is important for the 
No. 2 Michigan softball team in its 
chase for another Big Ten conference 
title.

But 
before 
the 
Wolverines 

take on the Scarlet Knights, they 
will participate in an event that, 
according to coach Carol Hutchins, 
should allow her players a glance at 
the bigger picture outside of softball.

Thursday, Hutchins and her team 

will host the seventh annual Michigan 
Softball Academy, a fundraiser aimed 
at raising money and awareness in 
the fight against breast cancer, before 
donning pink in their series opener 
against Rutgers on Friday.

In exchange for a donation that 

serves as a registration fee, the event 
offers participants the chance to 
learn softball while interacting with 
coaches and players.

Hutchins was intrigued by the 

women’s football academies held by 
former head football coach Lloyd 
Carr that similarly raised money and 
awareness for cancer research, and 
then one day, an exchange at her own 
summer camp inspired her to start 
her own fundraiser.

“While the kids were registering, 

the moms were talking about how 
cool it would be to go to camp and 
how they wish they could have gone 
to softball camp,” Hutchins said. “I 
said, ‘What would you do if you went 
to camp?’ They said, ‘We’d run the 
bases, get to hit on the field and drink 
wine.’ I said, ‘That sounds like a good 
camp,’ and that’s the way it was born. 
We were in at that time with the 
American Cancer Society, and I said, 
‘This would be a great thing to do, 
and I’d really like to do it,’ and wow, 
it’s really turned into something.

“The first year we had 84 

participants, we raised $20-some-
thousand — I forget the exact number 
— but it was great and very heart-
warming. We had a fantastic time. 
Within a year or two, we were up 
to $80,000, and the last two years, 
$125,000 each year. And we’re on 
pace this year to break it.”

According 
to 
the 
academy’s 

website, it has already raised over 
$106,000 in donations.

In previous years, other Michigan 

coaches such as men’s basketball 
coach John Beilein and women’s 
basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico 
have participated in the event.

And this year, there’s a special 

twist 
involving 
football 
coach 

Jim Harbaugh: a home run derby 

between him and former Michigan 
football player Rick Leach that 
stemmed from a challenge Leach 
issued Harbaugh at his induction 
into the Pioneer High School Hall of 
Fame.

“Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
wife 
had 

already agreed to be the (Honorary 
Chair), and Rick Leach has been a 
member of the academy on a couple 
occasions,” Hutchins said. “I thought 
it was a fantastic way to get Harbaugh 
involved, and I of course said we’re 
going to only do this if we make 
money on this. So I think we’ve raised 
$10,000 so far just on the home run 
derby, and we’re hoping for Harbaugh 
to get his fundraising going because 
Leach is beating him. How you win 
in the academy, whether it’s the home 
run derby or the academy itself, you 
win by raising the most money. That’s 
the name of the game.”

For Hutchins, the event not only 

raises money and awareness for an 
important cause, but it also provides 
her team with a bit of perspective.

“It’s a chance for our kids to step 

outside of their softball selves and 
recognize that there’s a bigger picture 
in the world,” Hutchins said. “We’re 
really overprivileged. I always tell 
people I work with overprivileged 
people — we’re healthy, we’re young 
and we have our life in front of us.”

Michigan beats 
Eastern, 12-0 

By NATE CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

YPSILANTI, Mich. — Three 

times this season, the No. 21 
Michigan baseball team played 
Eastern Michigan.

And in all three games, the 

Wolverines (10-5 Big Ten, 31-12 
overall) were victorious. They 
added a 12-0 victory Wednesday 
to their previous 12-4 win on 
May 3 and 19-3 drubbing of the 
Eagles on April 13.

“We’re 

always looking 
to 
have 

quality at-bats 
and 
string 

quality at-bats 
together,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich. 
“We 

trust 
that 

when we do 
that, we will 
have scoring opportunities, and 
we want to cash in and take 
advantage of them.”

Michigan wasted no time 

getting 
on 
the 
scoreboard 

Wednesday.

With two outs in the top of the 

first inning, junior right fielder 
Carmen 
Benedetti 
walked, 

bringing junior catcher Harrison 
Wenson to the plate. Wenson 
promptly drove Benedetti in 
with a double to give his team an 
early lead.

But it was the second frame 

where the Wolverines really put 
their foot on 
the gas pedal.

Freshman 

third 
baseman 
Jimmy 
Kerr 

and freshman 
second 
baseman 
Ako Thomas 
revved Michigan’s engines by 
drawing back-to-back one-out 
walks. Sophomore third basemen 
Jake Bivens then grounded into 
a fielder’s choice, but an error 
allowed him to safely reach base 
and Kerr to score.

The miscue proved to be 

costly for Eastern Michigan (8-7 
Mid-American, 17-25 overall) 

as fifth-year senior left fielder 
Matt Ramsay then hit a sacrifice 
fly 
to 
bring 
Thomas 
home 

and Benedetti scored Bivens 
on an RBI double to give the 
Wolverines a 4-0 advantage.

“I’m just seeing pitches that 

I can drive, not trying to do too 
much,” Benedetti said. “The guys 
were doing a great job of getting 
on base today. I’m happy to drive 
them in and help the team out.”

Michigan truly put the game 

away in the fourth as Benedetti 

smacked 
another 
RBI 
double. 

Wenson 
proceeded 
to 
reach 

on 
another 

Eagles’ 
error, 

permitting 
senior 
center 

fielder 
Cody 

Bruder to hit 
his own RBI 

double. The Wolverines only 
continued to pile on from there.

But 
what 
might 
be 
the 

most 
impressive 
feat 
from 

Wednesday’s 
game 
was 
the 

pitching 
performance 
from 

freshman 
left-hander 
Will 

Tribucher. He threw six shoutout 
innings, allowing only one hit 
and three walks while striking 
out five.

Part of Tribucher’s big night 

might have been due to a new 
pitch he recently added to his 
arsenal.

“Coach (Sean) Kenny and I 

started working 
on 
a 
cutter 

yesterday,” 
Tribucher said. 
“I have to give 
it to him, he’s 
been helping me 
out a lot along 
the way. I got a 
couple of guys 

out with it.”

Wednesday’s 
victory 

improves 
Michigan’s 
out-

of-conference record to 8-2 
since March 25. However, the 
Wolverines won’t have much 
time to dwell on their non-
conference success, as they will 
return to Big Ten action Friday 
night against Rutgers.
