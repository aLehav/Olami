Hundreds of United Auto 
Workers picketers were met 
by 
presidential 
candidate 
Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren 
at 
the General Motors Detroit-
Hamtramck 
Plant 
Sunday 
afternoon. Warren marched 
with workers at the plant 
who are striking because of 
contract 
negotiations. 
GM 
has announced the plant is 
expected to close in January 
2020.
“GM 
made 
billions 
of 
dollars in profits last year and 
closed five plants around the 
county,” Warren said at a press 
conference after picketing. 
“GM is demonstrating that it 
has no loyalty to the workers 
of America or to the people of 
America. Their only loyalty is 
to their own bottom line.”
The decision to strike was 
made by UAW leaders last 
week after a 2015 collective 
bargaining 
agreement 
expired. Nearly 50,000 UAW 
members across the country 
are striking until the UAW 
and GM agree on a contract 
that preserves fair wages, 
affordable health care, profit 
sharing and job security for 
temporary 
and 
permanent 
workers.
UAW’s strike is expected to 

cost GM $50 million per day. 
The union last went on strike 
in 2007, though it ended after 
two days when the parties 
reached an agreement.
Ahead of her visit, Warren 
met with state politicians, 
including Michigan Attorney 
General Dana Nessel, and 
UAW 
leaders 
at 
Legends 
Coney Island in Detroit to hear 
about workers’ experiences 
first hand. Warren said she 
has 
advocated 
for 
union 
rights while in the Senate and 
would continue to if elected 
president.
“The workers of the UAW 
are here to say ‘no more,’” 
Warren said. “They want a 
fair wage. They want benefits. 
They want what it takes to 
be part of America’s middle 
class.”
Warren, who was named 
the 
leading 
Democratic 
candidate in Iowa in a recent 
poll from the Des Moines 
Register, CNN and Mediacom, 
refused to speculate about 
polls at this point in the race 
when speaking with the press. 
Other presidential hopefuls, 
including Sen. Bernie Sanders 
and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, have 
also made or intend to make 
visits to the Detroit picketers.

Naina 
Agrawal-Hardin, 
one 
of the lead organizers of the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike and a junior at Washtenaw 
International High School, is 
worried for her future. 
“I’m here fighting for climate 
justice because I know that if we 
don’t fight for climate justice then 
we won’t have anything left to 
fight for,” Agrawal-Hardin said. 
Students, 
faculty 
and 
Ann 
Arbor residents gathered for the 
Washtenaw County Climate Strike 
on Ingalls Mall Friday afternoon. 
The strike included main-stage 
performances by activists, poets 
and musicians, as well as more than 
25 workshops educating attendees 
on issues related to climate change 
such as “Green New Deal 101,” 

“Addressing Climate Change at 
Home,” “The Importance of Water 
in Indigenous Communities” and 
more. 
According to a tweet from 
16-year-old 
Swedish 
climate 
activist 
Greta 
Thunberg, 
the 
leading 
figure 
of 
the 
#FridaysForFuture 
movement, 
more than 4,638 youth climate 
strikes took place Friday in more 
than 139 nations.
The 
movement 
began 
in 
August 
2018 
after 
Thunberg 
began protesting the lack of 
climate action from the Swedish 
government. Thunberg sat outside 
the Swedish parliament every 
school day for three weeks and 
inspired a world-wide movement, 
led primarily by young people, to 
hold their nations accountable 
to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 
to maintain a below 2 degrees 

Celsius pre-industrial levels, in 
alignment with the 2015 Paris 
Agreement.
Last 
March’s 
Washtenaw 
County Climate Strike, which had 
an estimated turnout of 2,500-
3,000 people, led to the arrest of 
10 students who participated in 
a 7.5-hour sit-in in the Fleming 
Administrative Building.
The students refused to leave 
until President Mark Schlissel 
addressed their demand for a one-
hour public meeting about the 
University’s plan for combating 
climate change and attaining 
carbon 
neutrality 
without 
screening questions. Last week, 
the 
six 
demonstrators 
who 
were charged with trespassing 
appeared in court for a pretrial 
hearing in preparation for the 
official Oct. 10 trials.
Efforts 
to 
combat 
climate 

change are not only being taken 
on by students, but also by local 
communities. 
On 
Wednesday, 
the Washtenaw County Board 
of 
Commissioners 
voted 
unanimously to endorse a climate 
emergency declaration, signalling 
the onset of regional efforts to limit 
greenhouse gas emissions and 
calling on the state of Michigan 
and the federal government to 
declare a climate emergency. 
At Friday’s strike, Business 
senior and co-president of Net 
Impact Gillian Cobb, who attended 
the event, described the student 
organization’s goal to promote 
sustainable business models. She 
explained how climate activism 
intersects 
with 
with 
many 
academic disciplines.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

A group of students gathered 
on the front steps of the Hatcher 
Graduate 
Library 
on 
Friday 
evening for Breaking the Silence 
of Stigma on Mental Health, 
an event meant to address how 
stigma surrounding mental health 
impacts communities of color.
Live Love Fitness LLF and the 
University of Michigan’s Asian 
American Association co-hosted 
the event. Different representatives 
from organizations across campus 
also came to support including 
the Black Student Union, CAPS 
in Action, United Asian American 
Organizations and Hope for the 
Day.
Tiffany Yoo, event organizer 
and the founder of Live Love 
Fitness LLF, spoke at the event 
about her struggles with mental 
health from middle school to 
college. Her speech centered 
around how she felt she couldn’t 
confide in anyone throughout high 
school and most of college.
 “During my senior year of high 
school, I was obese and that didn’t 
help with the depression, which I 
didn’t really understand because 

nobody would talk about it,” Yoo 
said. “Nowadays people know 
what depression is, even as a child. 
But back then I had no idea what 
it really was because I thought I 
didn’t know anyone who had it 
because no one would talk about 
it.”

Yoo 
explained 
the 
stigma 
surrounding 
anxiety 
and 
depression held her back from 
going out of her comfort zone and 
making new friends.
“I was very afraid of people 
knowing what I was going through 
because I just wanted to make new 

friends,” Yoo said. “I didn’t want 
people to gossip about me, to be 
mean, label me as like, ‘Oh, she’s 
like that depressed girl, she has 
issues.’”

In Riverside Park along the 
Huron River in Ann Arbor, 
family and friends gathered 
Saturday night to celebrate 
the Leukemia and Lymphoma 
Society’s 20th anniversary of 
the Light the Night fundraiser. 
The night started with food 
and games, followed by an 
opening ceremony of lighting 
the lantern and a walk around 
Ann Arbor. 
LLS was founded by New 
York 
couple 
Rudolph 
and 
Antoinette Roesler de Villiers 
in 1949 after they lost their 
son to leukemia. Named after 
their late son, the Robert 
Roesler de Villiers Foundation 
started in a small Wall Street 
office.

ALEC COHEN/Daily
LSA Dean Anne Curzan discusses her long-term goals during an interview with The Daily in the LSA Building Friday morning.

DESIGN BY ALEC COHEN

Ann Arbor resident Anne 
Bradley helped coordinate 
the event. She has been with 
LLS for two and a half years 
and believes Light the Night 
is a perfect example of LLS’s 
mission. 
“It’s 
an 
inspirational 
community event based on 
raising funds and awareness 
to 
end 
blood 
cancer,” 
Bradley said. “Our mission is 
to end leukemia, lymphoma, 
myeloma and non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma and improve the 
quality of life for patients 
and their families.” 
Bradley explained how the 
funds from the fundraiser 
are distributed — the vast 
majority of goes to helping 
individuals 
and 
their 
families afflicted by cancer. 
“80 percent of all of our 
dollars go straight to mission 
and the funds we raise 
support 
research, 
patient 
support 
programs, 
things 
like co-pay assistance, travel 

assistance, support groups 
and free education,” Bradley 
said.
Bradley brought up the 
high cost of medicine, making 
note of the 5,000-percent 
increase in the price of the 
drug Daraprim, used to treat 
some 
cancers 
and 
other 
illnesses. 
“We 
also 
support 
advocacy,” 
Bradley 
said. 
“Our job is to make sure that 
when cures do happen, the 
patients are able to access 
those cures.”
Bradley said the money is 
only a small part of LLS — 
the larger part of the group 
is to support families. 
“It’s about feeling that 
warmth 
and 
sense 
of 
community,” Bradley said. 
“I’ve talked to a lot of 
survivors and families and 
they talk often about how 
isolated they feel and how 
lonely they feel when they 
get that diagnosis. There’s 
something to be said for 
being part of a community 
and that’s what this is all 
about.” 

Light 
the 
Night 
also 
featured sponsored families 
with cancer survivors, one 
of which was Team Lena, 
which consisted of parents 
William and Amanda Kaczur. 
William said Lena’s journey 
inspired them to give back 
to the LLS community. He 
said the family feels a sense 
of community at events like 
Light the Night. 
“Once you go through an 
experience like ours, one of 
the biggest things coming 
out of it is pretty much 
everybody wants to give 
back,” Kaczur said. “This is 
a way for us to give back, to 
help support, to help promote 
because in a lot of ways we’re 
the most comfortable at places 
and events like this. There are 
so many people here with a 
similar experience so it makes 
us feel very comfortable.” 
Lena was only 18 months 
old when she was diagnosed 
with acute myeloid leukemia. 
Amanda got a call from their 
daycare program that she 
needed to go home due to a 
rash on her legs and arms. 

After taking her blood at their 
pediatrician’s 
office, 
they 
were worried about her high 
white blood cell count.
“That was it. We went 
to 
[C.S.Mott 
Children’s 
Hospital’s] emergency room 
and we started a six-month 
long chemo treatment journey 
to attack her acute myeloid 
leukemia,” 
Kazcur 
said. 
“She went through intense 
chemotherapy for six months. 
We finished up at the end 
of November and she just 
finished up what they call 
maintenance 
where 
every 
three months she was getting 
a spinal tap. She had her last 
spinal tap two weeks ago and 
she was negative for cancer.”
William said Lena was the 
strongest one of the trio and 
is amazed by the strength of 
their three-year-old daughter. 
“She was the strength, the 
glue that kept us all together, 
the one that’s going through 
it,” Kazcur said. “Kids are 
amazing.

As a freshman at the 
University of Michigan in 
2011, Carlina Duan didn’t 
know what the term “person 
of color” meant. 
“I wasn’t keyed into that 
way of speaking as much. 
I’m not sure the campus was 
either.”
Campus 
was 
pre-2016 
election, 
and 
Michigan 
in Color, the section of 
The Michigan Daily that 
Duan 
would 
eventually 
manage, had just started 
as a column housed under 
the Opinion section. Maybe 
in part due to the political 
climate of the time, Duan 
said the conversations on 
campus about race felt more 
muted then compared to 
today. Those conversations 
also lacked a centralized 
platform –– a signal that 

there 
was 
a 
space 
for 
Michigan in Color to fill.
“I think there was a 
hunger for narratives that 
people had overlooked –– 
prior there was really no 
space for people to think 
about storytelling from that 
perspective.”
Soon after Michigan in 
Color’s founding, the term 
“person of color” became a 
part of Duan’s daily lexicon, 
as she helped grow Michigan 
in Color from a column to a 
full-fledged section of The 
Michigan Daily while also 
becoming 
of 
the 
Daily’s 
most prolific writers. Her 
piece “Our sacrifice, our 
shame,” which was written 
in 2014, remains the most-
read MiC piece in its history. 
The piece garnered over 150 
positive comments online 
–– 
a 
rarity 
for 
writers 
publishing 
radical 
words 
about race. 

Her writing career was 
only beginning. Since her 
graduation in 2015, Duan 
has 
written 
a 
book 
of 
poetry, received her MFA 
from 
Vanderbilt, 
and 
is 
now teaching an English 
125 class at the University 
while pursuing her PhD 
–– successes she attributes 
largely to the community 
she created at the Daily.
“I 
think 
that 
I 
was 
really excited about the 
possibilities 
that 
MiC 
showed me –– that writing 
can kind of transform others 
and myself.”
Duan’s research concerns 
pedagogical strategies for 
using creative writing as 
activism –– a topic that 
in turn examines the role 
people of color play in 
teaching an audience about 
identity. While Duan said 
she hopes she can instill 
a sense of activism in her 

students, she knows there is 
no way for them to embody 
her own lived experiences, a 
limit to teaching impossible 
to cross.
Coupled 
with 
the 
complexity of being one of 
the few Asian Americans 
in 
the 
creative 
writing 
PhD 
program, 
identity 
has become one of the 
more salient aspects of her 
teaching career thus far.
“I think a lot about how 
there 
are 
experiences 
my 
students 
will 
never 
understand. But I think 
about 
the 
classroom 
as 
a space in which I can 
incorporate 
different 
questions in literature that 
many students might have 
never encountered,” Duan 
said. “We think a lot about 
language as ideology and 
language as action. I try and 
introduce text and writers 
and 
thinkers 
into 
their 

world that might ask 
certain questions that 
can help them think 
about activism.”
But 
in 
teaching 
her 
lived 
experiences became 
a 
vulnerability 
to 
tokenizing as well as 
a partial release in 
ownership of her own 
personal experiences. 
As a minority in the 
English department, 
Duan 
said 
it 
is 
important for herself 
to balance her desire 
to teach about identity 
with the protection of 
her own experiences. 
Though she is now a 
teacher, it is not her 
responsibility to use 
her 
experiences 
to 
teach people about 
race.
“It 
can 
be 
frustrating 
to 
be 
looked at as the only 
one of the experts in 
the room, but I feel 
very strongly about 
kind of keeping for 
myself a certain set 
of experiences to protect 
myself from feeling used and 
tokenized,” Duan said. “It’s 
not my personal obligation 
educate everyone on specific 
lived experience.”
Being 
a 
PoC 
writer 
doesn’t only run the risk of 
tokenization, Duan said. It 
can also take a toll on mental 
health. The process of first 
exploring and then sharing 
deeply personal experiences 
can be draining and difficult, 
so much so that it’s a “radical 
and 
super 
revolutionary 
act,” Duan said. But she 
stressed that to help remedy 
these difficulties, a sense 
of community is important. 
By 
actively 
remembering 
the women who paved the 
way for her to be able to 
write about race, Duan said 
the sense of solidarity she 
feels helps her remember 
the radical importance of 
writing. 

“I try and keep a kernel of 
why I began to write in the 
first place,” Duan said. “So 
much of that for me is about 
community 
and 
I 
think 
there are a lot of narratives 
that come from the fairly 
westernized and fairly white 
cannon of literature that 
writers should be solitary 
figures who exist to produce 
and produce. I feel really 
accountable to writing with 
other people.”
Despite these practices, 
the act of writing about 
race continues to be very 
difficult, 
especially 
for 
those who choose to make 
writing their career in a 
society that doesn’t reward 
writers in the same way it 
rewards other professions. 
This stigma is one of the 
main reasons Duan decided 
to become a teacher –– she 
entered the field through 
empowering teachers and 
she wants to do the same for 
others.
“Our 
society 
doesn’t 
really believe in writers as 
being able to make it and be 
“productive” –– whatever 
that means. Yet, writing 
exists as a way for me to 
chisel 
away 
at 
different 
questions 
that 
have 
to 
do with how I want to be 
generative and generous and 
productive.”
And 
for 
the 
current 
students 
who 
also 
want 
writing 
to 
be 
their 
mechanism for productivity 
and generosity?
“Know your stories don’t 
exist in a vacuum. What MiC 
is doing is building its own 
cannon and letting people 
write alongside a lineage 
to which they can feel a 
sense of duty and gratitude. 
Each story is a part of a 
community.”
Maybe this story is a part 
of that community, too.

remake of Maze and Frankie 
Beverley’s famous “Before I 
Let Go”, which was added to 
everyone’s playlists for family 
barbeques. Fast forward to 
now, there seems to be an 
obsession with picking apart 
celebrities’ Instagram photos, 
in particular Beyonce’s, to 
decide if she is “expecting” 
or not. The internet is pretty 
quick to turn little things into 
trending topics on Twitter, 
and 
recently, 
Beyonce’s 

“weight gain” has caused 
speculation. 
Another Black woman that 
has once again taken over 
the 
industry 
is 
Rihanna. 
Her 
“Fenty 
Beauty” 
line 
continues 
to 
fly 
off 
the 
shelves of cosmetic stores 
and her fashion-line “Fenty” 
is growing. As she is busy 
building 
an 
empire, 
she 
recently hosted her charity 
Diamond Ball, and the talk 
surrounding her success this 
year was unmatched with 
the Internet’s rave about the 
appearance of her stomach. 
Once again, the question of 
if Rihanna was expecting 
became 
a 
worldwide 
conversation on social media. 
But, there was not much 
talk around how both of 
these women’s privacy was 
being invaded, considering 
that much of the pregnancy 
rumors were due to both 
women appearing to have 
gained 
weight. 
These 
reactions 
made 
me 
think 

about 
the 
motherhood 
mandate, 
specifically 
in 
Rihanna’s case. The mandate 
consists of the idea that 
bearing children is essential 
to a female’s life; not having 
children would challenge her 
womanhood, thus feeling less 
like a woman. Motherhood is 
special to those who choose to 
and are able to bear children, 
but it can limit those who 
do not want children due to 
societal pressures through 
social media, for instance. 
Both Rihanna and Beyonce 
have surpassed the peak of 
their 
careers, 
but 
people 
still questioned the ultimate 
thing that would make their 
lives (or the lives of fans) 
complete: having a child. It’s 
almost as if society wants to 
see celebrities have children 
for their pleasure and for 
the aesthetic, but it isn’t that 
simple, nor should it be. 
With the rise of the trend 
of posting pictures of babies 
online and the struggles new 

moms go through, it can be 
a virtual support system for 
aspiring mothers. But simply 
using a “woman’s instinct” 
to claim that a woman is 
pregnant is close-minded and 
dangerous; this is an example 
of a reaction on social media to 
both Rihanna and Beyonce’s 
recent photos. Women can 
experience miscarriages and 
difficult 
pregnancies 
that 
affects their mind, body, and 
soul mentally and physically, 
which is why they often 
do 
not 
announce 
they’re 
expecting until months into 
their pregnancy. 
Additionally, 
why 
is 
weight 
gain 
automatically 
correlated with pregnancy? 
Experiencing weight gain can 
come from numerous reasons, 
and it does not have to be 
explained to anyone. It isn’t 
fair to expect any woman to 
look a certain way their entire 
life. Pictures do not give away 
all the answers. Celebrities 
are in the spotlight all the 

time, but society should be 
careful not to assume that 
any woman is pregnant (or 
ask) due to weight gain and 
deceiving photos that can be 
manipulated. 
I appreciate all mothers; 
my own mother has balanced 
work life with raising my 
brother and I in ways I still 
don’t fully understand, but 
will 
forever 
be 
grateful 
for. But, it is important to 
recognize that those who are 
not mothers are visible in 
society, and are not mothers 
for 
personal 
reasons 
like 
focusing on their career. 
Let’s 
celebrate 
mothers 
and non-mothers and not 
put down one over the other 
for the decisions they make. 
Recognize the beauty in both 
lives. Be careful when picking 
apart 
photos, 
or 
simply 
making assumptions about 
one’s body because words can 
be harmful. 

Okay, I’m gonna be honest 
here: I used to be such a 
Disney fangirl. I think most 
girls were. I lived for Disney 
Princess movies more than 
anything, though. And when 
The Princess and The Frog 
came out, I was ecstatic. 
A 
Black 
Disney 
Princess. 
Finally. And though Disney 
has entered a new phase of 
princess movies with the 
goal of making them fleshed-
out, 
independent 
female 
characters 
(actually 
make 
them the heroines of their 
own story), I’ll always love 

the older ones. And Disney 
knows I’m not the only one, 
so they’re remaking them in 
live-action knowing people 
will come out to watch them. 
Which brings me to the point 
of this piece: The new live-
action Ariel is going to be 
Black. 
Not 
gonna 
lie, 
my 
first 
reaction 
was 
more 
exasperation than anything. 
At that time, I’d been a little 
tired of the idea of making an 
originally white character, 
seemingly on a whim, a 
different ethnicity. It just 
looked like a money grab to 
me, which it probably is to an 
extent. They know that Black 

people will come out to see 
this movie for the single fact 

that the lead is going to be 
Black. Yes, it’s representation, 
but it didn’t feel right to me. 
I could understand why some 
people were upset by it. You 

grew up with this character 
and this image of them that 

you hold in your mind. And 
now they’re changing things 
about this character.
But after thinking about 
it and its implications as 

well as asking people for 
their opinions, I came to 
the conclusion that it really 
wasn’t what I was making 
it out to be. In the Tale of 
the Little Mermaid, her race 
has absolutely nothing to do 
with the story. It would be 
one thing to make Merida 
from “Brave” Black, because 
she’s a Scottish princess. Not 
to say there aren’t Scottish 
Black people now, there are, 
but I doubt there were in the 
time period Brave took place 
in, so it would be completely 
inaccurate and offensive at 
that point. Being Scottish is 
essential to Merida’s story 
and the way it’s told. From 

the accents to the way people 
dress, Brave is a story that can 
only be told the way it is.
 Ariel’s story, on the other 
hand, is not tied to the color 
of her skin nor is the plot tied 
to a specific period in time 
the way Brave is. It’s about 
her curiosity and desire to be 
human. Once people can get 
past their initial reactions 
to the race change, they’ll be 
able to enjoy the new take on 
the old tale and the positive 
impact another Black princess 
will have on young Black girls 
everywhere.

The Wing’s feminist work expands online
I

n a world so androcentric, 
The Wing exists as a feminist 
utopia 
and 
organization 
whose mission is to connect “a 
growing community of women 
across the country and globe, 
gathering 
together 
to 
work, 
connect, and thrive.” It provides a 
range of services, like child care, 
temperatures set for women’s 
bodies, a women-focused lending 
library, 
conference 
rooms, 
showers, a calendar of events 
ranging from former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton to feminst 
icon Gloria Steinem to actress 
Kerry Washington, pump rooms, 
chairs ergonomically designed 
for a range of women’s bodies, 
podcast studios and a café. 
And the female-oriented work 
and community space just got 
better. 
The Wing recently announced 
an online networking platform 
for members. One of the most 
important aspects of the platform 
is a LinkedIn-like job board 
where members can post and 
hire for jobs, as well as post their 
own resumes and availability 
for freelance projects. Members 
can also message each other and 
connect online. 
With their online expansion, 
The Wing is broadening their 
feminist work into online spaces 
beyond their physical spaces in 
cities like New York, Los Angeles, 
Chicago, Boston, Washington, 
D.C. and London. 
In a time when fourth-wave 
feminist ideals finally started 
to 
hit 
mainstream 
America 
in 
the 
#MeToo 
Movement 
but ultimately ended in the 
confirmation of Supreme Court 
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who 
was credibly accused of sexual 
assault, the work The Wing is 
doing is critically important. 
Audrey Gelman, one of the 
co-founders of The Wing, recently 
told Kara Swisher of the “Recode 
Decode” podcast, “(The company 
is) about building a community … 
(Our members) use it as a place, as 
a community, as a network, as a 
place to meet people.” 
Gelman also noted how The 
Wing was developed in the 
fashion of women’s clubs in the 
early 20th century. “We were very 

inspired to create something that 
was obviously more modern and 
progressive and diverse, but that 
had some of the spirit of those 
clubs,” she said. While some have 
pushed back on the company for 
centering women, The Wing’s 
website states, “The Wing is a 
diverse community open to all.” 
And if men were to enter the 
premises, in Gelman’s words, “No, 
we don’t taze them or anything.” 
Additionally, 
Gelman 
discussed how their new online 
jobs network eliminates some of 
the bias that hinders women on 
broader platforms like LinkedIn. 
“Women are less likely to apply for 
jobs if they don’t have exactly the 
number of years of experience, so 
we coach people about the right 
way to post jobs to discourage 
that and to encourage people 
who 
may 
have 
untraditional 
backgrounds, etc., to apply,” she 

said. “And just, obviously, making 
sure that we’re building in safety 
and moderation from the very 
beginning, rather than having to 
add it after a scandal.” Gelman 
went on to tell Swisher the 
company does not receive profit 
from their new online platform as 
it is just another tool to improve 
women’s lives. 
The 
title 
page 
of 
The 
Wing’s website brands itself as 
“advancing women by gathering 
them together.” In many ways 
this is true, but The Wing is doing 
so much more. It is giving their 
members the tools to hire from — 
and be hired by — an incredible 
community of women for jobs that 
may have fallen victim to gender 
bias on other job-posting sites. 
In doing so, The Wing is 
engaging in the actual work 
of feminism. They are helping 

women promote each other 
in the workplace in order to 
disrupt the “old boys club” that 
has allowed men to maintain 
their systematic dominance for 
so long. 
This work continues to be 
desperately needed. In early 
September, 
Forbes 
released 
their list of the 100 most 
innovative leaders. It included 
just one woman, Ross Stores 
CEO Barbara Rentler, whose 
picture they did not even bother 
to include. In fact, there were 
more men named Stanley (and 
Michael and Mark and John and 
David and Jeffrey and Robert and 
Brian separately) than women 
on this list. And while Forbes 
could have included innovators 
like Susan Wojcicki, Indra Nooyi, 
Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer 
Hyman or The Wing co-founder 
Audrey Gelman herself, it is true 
that women lead just 5.4 percent 
of S&P 500 companies — just 
0.4 percent of which are women 
of color. The Wing’s platform 
enables women to uplift and 
amplify other women, which is 
a step in the right direction for 
improving these disparities. 
In the past, I have been critical 
of sorority-like feminism found 
in Instagram posts and T-shirts 
emblazoned 
with 
feminist 
mantras like “The Future is 
Female.” Too often, this type 
of feminism does not include 
any work, as poet bell hooks 
says, to “end sexism, sexist 
exploitation and oppression.” It 
stops short of work and settles for 
individual feel-good actions that 
do nothing to actually dismantle 
funadmentally white supremacist 
and 
patriarchal 
systems 
of 
oppression. 
But I applaud The Wing for 
its efforts to create spaces for 
women to thrive and uplift each 
other by taking, as Gelman says, 
“iterative steps forward to make 
life easier for women.” The word 
“empowerment” is tossed around 
so much that is has almost lost 
all meaning, but in this case, The 
Wing is truly empowering women 
in significant, structural ways.

Yang and UBI — possible even if not probable

Writing from a rich place
“

I’m already discredited, I’m 
already politicized, before 
I get out of the gate,” The 
late author Toni Morrison said 
in an interview with Hilton Als 
from The New Yorker Magazine. 
Morrison went on: “‘I can accept 
the labels’ — the adjectives like 
‘black’ and ‘female’ that are often 
attached to her work — ‘because 
being a black woman writer is not 
a shallow place but a rich place 
to write from. It doesn’t limit my 
imagination — it expands it. It’s 
richer than being a white male 
writer because I know more and 
I’ve experienced more.’” 
Morrison 
beautifully 
vocalizes the process by which 
our identities are internalized 
and 
subconsciously 
influence 
what we produce. While this 
idea applies to a diverse range 
of disciplines and is not limited 
to writing by any means, it 
actually prompts a particularly 
introspective question to grapple 
with: to what extent do our 
identities contribute to “good” 
writing and also in a way, inform 
our writing? On the flip side, how 
do our identities impact how our 
audiences’ view and understand 
our 
writing? 
While 
“good” 
writing is a social construct at its 
core, for exploration let’s follow 
Morrison’s working definition 
to say “good” writing signifies 
richness in content.
I’ll start: I am a liberal, Indian-
American woman and daughter 
to immigrants. Now that you 
know this about me, does your 
perception change as you read 
the rest of this column?
It absolutely does, and you’re 
lying to yourself if you object. It 
is the blatant truth that our core 
identities such as race, gender 
and political affiliations affect 
the way we interpret the world 
just as much as it affects the 
way the world views us and our 
work. Most writers are opposed 
to labels, but I wholeheartedly 
disagree and side with Morrison 
that they actually expand the 
richness of our writing. Morrison 
has never shied away from 

being a “black woman writer.” 
In fact, it’s essential to take 
into account race, gender and 
political affiliations of any author, 
lecturer or instructor. Productive 
dialogue results from confronting 
different 
opinions, 
and 
our 
viewpoints are reflections of 
our values and belief systems. In 
order to properly engage with a 
text, it’s necessary to look beyond 
the superficial and instead take 
into account the factors that play 
a role in the creation of the text. 

It’s important to view the 
characteristics 
that 
make 
us 
unique, whether it be cultural, 
spiritual or political, as a shared 
experience. 
Learning 
together 
is arguably the most successful 
method by which to expand our 
understanding of humanity. It’s 
important 
to 
force 
ourselves 
and others into uncomfortable 
spaces 
and, 
paradoxically, 
to 
grow 
comfortable 
with 
the 
uncomfortable. That being said, 
Morrison’s being a “black woman 
writer” does not automatically 
make it her “responsibility to be 
a teaching tool for white people” 
about Black culture, in the same 
way that Malcolm Gladwell isn’t 
writing to an audience consisting 
of 21-year old Indian-American 
women like myself. Morrison’s 
work and lasting legacy is defined 
by her ability to create a new 
space for women like herself. Her 
writing founded new perspectives 
on “Blackness” and beautifully 
exposed deeply personal and 
moving stories of Black women.
A personal favorite of mine, Toni 
Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye,” tells 

the story of Pecola Breedlove, 
a young Black girl who prays 
every single day for the beauty 
of blue eyes. This story addresses 
society’s obsession with beauty 
and beauty standards set forth 
by whiteness. Through Pecola’s 
idolization 
of 
“beauty,” 
the 
reader witnesses the way in 
which this toxic, normalized 
precedent of beauty operates 
from a young age and persists 
into 
adulthood. 
Morrison 
explains her purpose in the 
forward of “The Bluest Eye.” This 
text serves as a medium through 
which to reclaim racial beauty. 
There are elements to Pecola’s 
story 
that 
resonate 
within 
Morrison and are intended to 
ignite a fire within Black females 
to enact change. Her stories must 
be understood within the context 
of her life experiences as a Black 
woman in order to receive the 
level of attention and response 
that her writing demands. 
It’d be a disservice to the 
author, their experiences and 
ourselves 
to 
tip-toe 
around 
discussing a writer’s text with 
regards to their identities. What 
comprises our identity is meant 
to be displayed proudly to our 
audiences. Sharing our innermost 
traits and ideologies with those 
who are open-minded will benefit 
the masses by creating an open and 
inclusive learning environment. 
This is my final request: In an 
attempt to not be racist, don’t go 
so far as to be “color-blind” as 
plenty of colleagues and friends 
joke. Excluding and confronting 
race as if it is a taboo subject only 
further contributes to ingraining 
the racist rhetoric that exists 
within society. Here’s a general 
rule of thumb: If it makes you 
uncomfortable 
to 
talk 
about 
social and personal identities, 
then that’s a clear sign to use 
these formative years to educate, 
engage and encourage yourself. 
Become comfortable with the 
uncomfortable.

T

he 2020 presidential 
election is over a year 
away, and it’s already 
running 
at 
full 
speed. A field of more 
than 20 Democratic 
candidates 
has 
already 
been 
cut 
in 
half, 
and 
the 
remaining 
candidates are laser 
focused on setting 
themselves 
apart 
from the rest of the 
pack. The spectrum 
ranges from ultra-
progressives 
such 
as 
Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren, 
D-Mass., 
and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 
to more moderate candidates 
like former Vice President Joe 
Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg 
of South Bend, Ind. The most 
recent 
Democratic 
debate 
saw the presidential hopefuls 
discuss the most pressing issues 
to voters for the 2020 election: 
health 
care, 
gun 
violence, 
immigration and trade.
The 
one 
thing 
all 
the 
candidates have in common: 
political experience in one form 
or another. Except, that is, for 
Andrew Yang.
Yang, an Ivy League lawyer 
turned entrepreneur then non-
profit founder, is running on a 
central platform surrounding 
universal basic income, labeled 
by Yang and his campaign 
as the “Freedom Dividend.” 
The Freedom Dividend is a 
proposed governmental social 
program 
that 
gives 
every 
U.S. adult $1,000 a month for 
the rest of their lives. On the 
surface, this might seem to be 
the first step toward a socialist 
utopia 
and 
not 
something 
feasible in America. However, 
when weighing the costs and 
benefits of such a program, 
it becomes more complicated 
than labeling it simply as 
“socialist” or “impossible.” 
The economics of Yang’s 
Freedom 
Dividend 
are 
anything but straightforward, 
as there are different estimates 
on the exact costs and benefits 
associated 
with 
his 
policy. 
According to Yang’s website, 
the cost of UBI will be offset 
through a variety of new taxes 
and reduction in government 
spending. First of all, Yang plans 
to fund the Freedom Dividend 
through something called a 
Value Added Tax, or VAT. This 
is a type of consumption tax 
 
that taxes products whenever 
value is added, at any point 
in its supply chain — from 
production to the final sale. 
Almost 
all 
industrialized 
countries employ some form of 
VATs and it is most commonly 
found among countries in the 
European Union (the only major 
industrial country who does 
not use a VAT is the U.S.). In 
addition to a new VAT, Yang says 
funding for UBI would come 
from a reduction in current 
government expenditures, new 
revenue generated by economic 
growth as a result of the policy 
and increasing taxes on things 
such as financial transactions, 
capital 
gains 
and 
carbon 
pollution. 

In reality, funding UBI may 
not be as simple as Yang makes 
it out to be. According to the 
UBI Center, a think 
tank 
researching 
universal 
basic 
income 
policies, 
when 
factoring 
in 
all forms of revenue 
generation 
that 
would occur on top of 
all the separate costs, 
Yang’s 
Freedom 
Dividend would add 
about 
$1.4 
trillion 
to the budget deficit 
annually. The Tax Foundation 
published their own calculations 
that put the net effect at just 
under $1.5 trillion. That is not 
to say that implementing UBI 
necessarily increases the deficit. 
Those same reports conclude a 
version of UBI can be revenue 
neutral but only with different 
variables 
plugged 
in. 
For 
example, the VAT rate would 
have to be closer to 22 percent 
and the freedom dividend would 
have to be reduced from $1,000 
to $750 — as opposed to Yang’s 
10 percent proposal — according 
to the Tax Foundation.

The sticker cost is not the only 
concern in regard to UBI. Other 
worries include that of inflation: 
If every American is receiving 
$1,000 guaranteed each month, 
won’t prices just increase at 
the same rate? In short, not 
really. Inflation tends to arise 
from the supply of money, or 
governments’ printing of new 
money, and Yang’s UBI plan is 
funded through “established” 
money (taxes on money already 
in circulation). We could expect 
prices to increase marginally, 
but only as a result of taxes 
increasing 
production 
costs. 
Yang’s main argument is that 
for the average consumer the 
net benefits would outweigh 
these marginal price increases. 
Another common concern is 
that 
cash 
transfer 
systems 
discourage 
people 
from 
working. However, $12,000 a 
year is not enough to live off 
of, so naturally people will still 
need to work. In fact, a report 
published by MIT researchers 
that looks at cash transfer 
programs in six developing 
countries found “no systematic 
evidence that cash transfer 
programs discourage work.” 
For those who claim UBI could 
never work in the United States 
and is only possible in wealthy 
Scandinavian countries, there 
is already one U.S. state that 
has been practicing UBI since 
the ‘70s: Alaska. Alaska set up 
the Alaskan Permanent Fund in 
1976 which generates revenue 
from oil and mineral leases to 

fund an annual stipend. Not only 
do Alaskans now receive more 
than $2,000 a month, a working 
paper from the National Bureau 
of Economic Research shows 
that 
the 
implementation 
of 
Alaska’s UBI did not decrease 
work in the state — a clear 
reinforcement of UBI’s benefits.
There are other somewhat 
intangible, 
yet 
incredibly 
attractive, benefits to UBI as 
well. An example that Yang 
often speaks of is compensation 
for work that is currently 
undervalued, such as a stay-at-
home mom taking care of young 
children 
or 
people 
putting 
more resources into creative 
projects. It could also help small 
businesses compete with larger 
retailers, something incredibly 
important to local communities 
and cultures. It’s impossible to 
calculate the exact economic 
benefit from these examples, 
but they are invaluable to our 
society. UBI is one way to 
support them.
Universal basic income is a 
mixed bag that comes with clear 
benefits and setbacks. While the 
economics show it is technically 
feasible, and has even been 
successful in the U.S., it seems 
Americans are still hesitant 
to embrace UBI with open 
arms. According to a recent 
Gallup poll, only 48 percent of 
Americans support UBI as a 
way to help Americans who lost 
their jobs because of advances 
in artificial intelligence, and 
the data suggests a major split 
between 
pro-UBI 
younger 
voters and anti-UBI older voters. 
Essentially, the argument over 
UBI boils down to political will. 
On one hand, the benefits it 
would generate both abstractly 
and in real terms are genuinely 
exciting 
and 
theoretically 
possible. On the other hand, 
Yang’s current plan would be 
a massive economic burden on 
the system as it stands today. 
Would the benefits be worth 
the increased debt? Or the 
increased taxes needed to make 
it revenue neutral? I’m not yet 
convinced it would be. 
Ultimately, I find myself torn 
on UBI and Yang as a candidate. 
He seems to be the Democratic 
Party’s 
ultimate 
wild 
card: 
breaking 
away 
from 
the 
traditional progressive policies 
supported by other candidates 
while also avoiding the typical 
anti-Trump rhetoric found in 
the rest of the field. Many people 
like to throw around the word 
“electability” when talking about 
who deserves support, but I’m 
cautious of such ideas. After all, 
an entrepreneur with no name 
recognition has no business being 
tied in the polls with the likes 
of Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., yet 
here we are. Even if Yang does not 
become the Democratic nominee, 
his ideas are refreshing and 
worth talking about. Whether 
you are a moderate Democrat, a 
strong progressive or a curious 
conservative, you should give 
Andrew Yang and UBI deserve 
more attention.

As under-recognized as he is outside of his home 
country, Luis Alberto Spinetta is considered one of 
Argentina’s greatest ever musicians. Similar to Victor 
Jara in neighboring Chile, his work played a stark 
contrast against the authoritarian junta government 
of Juan Carlos Onganía, heavily influenced musically 
by jazz and pscychedelia and lyrically from poets and 
philosophers from Nietzche to French playwright 
Antonin Artaud, whose name is used as the title of one 
of Spinetta’s best albums, Artaud.
Pescado Rabioso itself was a short-lived project 
of Spinetta’s conception from 1971 to 1973, but for all 
intents and purposes, Artaud is a solo Spinetta project. 
Listening to Spinetta’s works, one can see the direct 
influences from the musical movements burgeoning in 
the Anglophone world at the time. Still, they feel much 
more ahead of their time. Echoes of Radiohead can 
be heard from decades before the English group even 
started recording. 
“Cementerio Club,” an early standout, is a slow 
ballad with nothing especially musically interesting 
happening except a few neat licks here and there. 
Spinetta’s vocals, while slightly nasal and high-pitched, 
are nonetheless soothing and are a conduit for the lyrics 
which give Spinetta the reputation as a poet in addition 
to just a singer-songwriter. He sings to a lover, “Qué 
solo y triste voya estar en este cementerio / Qué calor 
hará sin vos en verano,” (“How lonely and sad I’ll be in 
this graveyard / How scorching the summer will be 
without you”) using the idea of death introduced in the 
first lines in which he sings, “Justo que pensaba en vos, 
nina, caí muerto” (“Baby when you entered my mind, 
I died”).
“Bajan” is another track where Spinetta flexes his 

lyrical gifts. His vocals are never really measured, 
tending to meander around with a flair for melodrama, 
and this is put to great effect in the powerful choruses, 
in which he sings, “Nena, nena, qué bien te ves / Cuando 
en tus ojos no importa si las horas / Bajan, el día se sienta 
a morir / Bajan, la noche se nubla sin fin / Y además vos 
sos el Sol / Despacio, también podés ser la luna,” (“Girl 
you look so beautiful / When your eyes don’t care if the 
hours / go down and the day awaits its death / and the 
night is endlessly cloudy / And either way, you’re the 
sun / And you can slowly become the moon”).
Artaud himself was a figure lightly associated with 
the surrealist movement in the early 20th century, 
famous for conceptualizing the “theater of cruelty,” 
where “cruelty” refers to the action of shocking the 
audience through more than just the words of the 
characters and the plot of the play, but also with gesture, 
lighting and sound. It is interesting, however, that 
Spinetta seems to reject the unfettered anarchism of his 
album’s namesake in many ways, except for the album’s 
masterpiece “A Starosta, el Idiota.” Over a powerful yet 
fragmented piano, Spinetta croons, “Bocas del aire 
del mar / Beban la sal de esta luz” (“Mouths of sea air 
/ Drink this light’s salt”). In the middle, the concept 
falls apart and features a cacaphony of sounds, from 
a sped-up Beatles sample to a woman sobbing, before 
returning with an exotic, distorted guitar and a hopeful 
“No llores más ya no tengas frío / No creas que ya no hay 
mas tinieblas / Tan solo debes comprenderla / Es como 
la luz en primavera” (“Don’t cry anymore, don’t be cold 
anymore / Don’t think there’s any more darkness / You 
just have to understand it / It’s like light in spring”).
Artaud is an album that reveals more and more 
after each listen. Even for non-Spanish speakers, the 
musical richness and complexity is readily apparent, 
and the way it is mixed, it is also rather intimate and 
comforting. Even if none of that sounds interesting as 
well, it might be worth just trying to collect one of the 
coolest looking vinyls there is out there.

‘Artaud’ is ever-revealing

WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

Words in Max Porter’s “Lanny” refuse to stay 
in their lane. I mean this in the most literal sense: 
They stack on top of one another, expand and 
contract at random and bend into and about the 
margins, as if drunk on their very impression. And 
they grow more belligerent with every page. By 
the end of Part 1, they don’t even land sequentially, 
opting instead to splatter the page in haphazard 
handfuls.
The verb for interacting with words flattened 
between the pages like bugmush feels more like 
“look” than “read.” Similarly, “Lanny” feels more 
like an experience than a text. To that point, it’s 
the most exhausting thing I’ve read this year. Max 
Porter’s sophomore novel, longlisted for the 2019 
Booker Prize, floats around a jaded artist, her 
yuppie husband and their peculiar-yet-brilliant 
young son, the titular Lanny, as they move from 
urban London to an ostentatiously creepy village. 
The trope is painfully rich: There are batty old 
neighbors (including “Mad Pete,” a once-artist 
who may or may not have dabbled in porn), secret 
bunkers dug into the earth and a local folk-spirit 
known as Dead Papa Toothwort that stalks 
villagers from the trees and whispers cynically 
about their microwave dinners.
Between the “spooky village” camp and the 
words sporadically sliding off the goddamn page, 
it’s within reason to sow a few first-glance doubts 
about “Lanny.” There are a lot of moving stylistic 
pieces that thwart its access, and Porter goes 
forth confidently in the direction of instability 
by dividing the project into narrative thirds. Part 
1 vacillates between the subjective perspectives 
of four major characters before fragmenting into 
disembodied snippets of direct, blunt thought 
from anonymous villagers in Part 2. And then Part 
3 is all up in the ether, slipping between first and 
third person, theater and novel, dreamscape and 
“reality” … I had to read the section three times to 
feel done, forcing the book to end through brute 
repetition, like some performed conclusion. It’s 
intense.
There is a plot somewhere beneath all these 
informal devices, though, and a surprisingly 

simple one at that: Lanny goes missing. But when 
you run that story through Porter’s neurotic 
narrative machine, its components are yoked 
apart and magnified into a pulsing array of issues. 
The biggest yokefest takes place in that gulf of 
perspective between parts 1 and 2, a deft move 
on Porter’s behalf that contrasts what we tell 
ourselves with what the rest of the community — 
a single character, at this point — sees, warps and 
spreads. For instance, the villagers in Part 2 are 
the ones that imply Mad Pete’s lascivious tastes, 
which complicates the wholesome art lessons he 
gave Lanny in Part 1; conversely, Lanny’s mum 
writes grisly thrillers to make a living, which is 
easy to understand from her own perspective, but 
now looks nothing but suspicious. With every new 
piece of information, paranoia builds, backs turn 
and credibility plummets. Despite the fact that 
all are represented and speak directly, this voice 
rings no more “true” than the subjectivity of Part 
1.
In 
an 
earlier 
anecdote, 
Lanny’s 
mum 
unknowingly captures a tense sort of triangle 
between data, fiction and truth. She once found 
baby Lanny in a tree house nine feet off the ground 
and, despite his repeated denial and airtight alibi, 
subscribes to the story that her father had snuck 
off and placed him there as a joke. “It was easier to 
accept that Dad was lying,” she explains, “than it 
was to have no rational explanation.”
Such transparent storymaking is the inventive, 
exhausting work of “Lanny.” In its own peculiarity, 
Porter’s bizarre little book deconstructs the myths 
we create to survive those moments when there 
is no rational explanation, everything from Dead 
Papa Toothwort to media coverage to the critical 
literary things I tell myself about the words falling 
off the page — whatever makes you feel better.
Most impressively, though, “Lanny” refuses to 
elevate one sort of myth over the other. Lanny’s 
mum is a creative hippie type and his father a 
(satirically hilarious) capitalist cog in the machine 
and, although the book’s very existence gravitates 
towards the purview of the former, both are 
depicted as violent: Lanny’s dad displaces his labor 
malaise and masculine anxiety onto the family 
and his Mum stabs rodents in the sink for release. 
It’s impossible to imagine these two together, but, 
somehow, they still bone.
“Lanny” is a lot for its 210 generously margined 
pages, and its ambition leaves loose ends that you 
will have to do work with. If you’re into the sort 
of reading experience that feels like wrestling, 
“Lanny” will be a very satisfying project. But it is 
the token experiment on the Booker menu that’s a 
little too left-of-center to progress to the shortlist, 
inheriting the 2018 seat of Nick Drnaso’s “Sabrina.” 
Until the Foundation catches up, though, it’s up to 
us to read the longlist, to keep the scene weird.

‘Lanny’ is a lot, positively

BOOK REVIEW

When Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews, the 
hosts of “Dancing with the Stars,” take to the fabled 
ballroom staircase to introduce the cast of “stars” 
each season, it’s pretty safe to assume that viewers 
are not expecting the best, brightest and up-and-
coming to appear on their screen. With alumni 
including Master P, Kate Gosselin and Nancy Grace 
over its 28-season run, “DWTS” has amassed a 
reputation for being an anti-Met Gala of sorts: You 
can pretty much expect everyone who isn’t anyone to 
turn up eventually. And while the show has had its 
share of bizarre seasons, this past Monday’s season 
premiere felt particularly absurd. Almost too absurd.
Of course, there were the usual suspects: The 
former athletes (murderer Ray Lewis and sentient 
skyscraper Lamar Odom), the ringer (Ally Brooke of 
girl group Fifth Harmony) and the shameless ABC 
plug (former “Bachelorette” Hannah Brown). Then 
came the questionable: Meredith from “The Office” 
belting “She Works Hard for the Money” on live 
television. And of course, the downright confusing: 
Kel Mitchell attempting to prove to America why we 
were wrong to choose Kenan over him. But, of all of 
the casting decisions born out of a fever dream, none 
seemed as surreal or as irresponsible as the decision 
to cast former White House Press Secretary, Sean 
Spicer, as a star. 
No, not Melissa McCarthy reprising her “Saturday 
Night Live” spoof — the real Sean Spicer, stuffed like 
a Hillshire Farm sausage into an ill-fitting, electric 
green flamenco blouse and skin-tight white pants. 
Yum.
From the first minutes of the season premiere, 
it became apparent to me that during the show’s 
year-long hiatus it underwent more upgrades than 
a Real Housewife — new graphics, sharper camera 
quality, improved props and possibly most irritating 
of all, new lengthy bits that precede every couple’s 
performance. According to Deadline, changes to the 
show’s classic format were implemented this year as 
a means to maintain audience interest in the show 
as it racks up more seasons. Desperate times call for 
desperate measures. 
Enter the Spice Rack. 
Despite the outpouring of criticism from the 
Internet when Spicer was first announced as a part 
of Season 28, ABC remained steadfast in the decision 
to televise the middle-aged white man’s powerful 
journey towards redemption and attaining rhythm. 

Although it would be irrational to believe for a 
moment that ABC would opt for integrity over ratings 
gold, it was not the mere decision to cast Spicer that 
drove me to the edge. What irked me to the point of 
near-insanity while watching live on Monday night 
was the show’s blatant and, frankly, condescending 
attempts at normalizing the former White House 
staffer as a sort of screwball sitcom antagonist, 
and not a political tool who has downplayed the 
Holocaust, lied on several occassions to the American 
public and continued to defend the fascist who tossed 
him out of D.C. like yesterday’s trash. To save you the 
ire, I’ll recount the most infuriating example of this. 
“What one word describes you?” Spicer is 
prompted, to which he smugly replies, “Beyoncé.” 
For future reference, ABC, Beyoncé is infallible, not 
people who simply co-opt her fame to dupe The 
Youth™.
Spicer stumbles through both interactions with 
others and his dance — a salsa to the Spice Girls’ “Spice 
Up Your Life.” Yes, that really happened. Although 
the entire viewing audience deserves an apology 
(and maybe compensation) for bearing witness to the 
ungodly pressure of Spicer’s slacks on his crotch, who 
truly deserves an apology is the Latinx population 
of America who had to watch a man partially 
responsible for their ongoing disenfranchisement 
essentially take a steaming dump on their culture. 
Because that’s who we forget, right? The real 
people affected by Spicer, his political cronies and 
his supporters who chant “Build the Wall” one day 
and celebrate Cinco de Mayo the next. In the rush by 
some moderates to absolve Spicer of his “minor” sins 
and see him as a man separate from — oh yeah — the 
career decisions he’s made as an autonomous adult, 
we don’t create a harmonious society or even “begin 
a conversation.” We are just complicit. 
Almost more importantly, we ruin the sanctity of 
escapist reality television. No longer can “Dancing 
with the Stars” merely be a place where America 
retreats from the pain of the real world to watch 
old has-beens break bones and dance the Foxtrot. 
With Mike Huckabee mobilizing Ford F-150 Twitter, 
panhandling online for prayers and votes to keep 
Spicer on the show for another week, the sustained 
blurring of lines between politics and entertainment 
continues and “Dancing with the Stars” becomes 
some sort of battleground for conservatives to “own 
libs.”
I beg of you, before it gets too dystopian in here, 
vote this man off. If not for me, then at least so we can 
focus on the true underdog of this season, America’s 
sweetheart, James Van der Beek. The electoral 
college is not on their side this time.

“Lanny”

Max Porter

Graywolf Press

March 5, 2019

Listening to Spinetta’s works, once can see the 
direct influences from the musical movements 
burgeoning in the Anglophone world at the 
time


Among 
my 
many 
complaints 
about 
Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” is how 
muddled it is in scope. Is it a movie about space 
time travel? About the future of humanity? 
About a scientist and her cosmos-wandering 
father? I’m not sure and neither is anyone 
else. What’s clear is that any film would have 
trouble being all those things simultaneously, 
successfully. “Interstellar” tries, and the result is 
claustrophobically awkward.
An equally grand movie 
that gracefully dodges these 
complications is “Ad Astra.” 
To call James Gray’s (“The 
Lost City of Z”) latest work 
a space drama would be 
almost wrong. It’s probably 
better classified as a drama 
that happens to take place 
in space. While the hazards, 
lessons, and implications of 
interplanetary travel compose 
the 
film’s 
backdrop, 
“Ad 
Astra” is purely the story of 
a broken man’s relationship 
with his father. When strange power surges 
threaten all life on Earth in the near future 
Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt, “Deadpool 2”) 
embarks on a journey for their origin — the last 
known location of his disappeared father.
One element common between “Ad Astra” 
and “Interstellar” is cinematographer Hoyte 
Van Hoytema (“Dunkirk”). His experience with 
space imagery is vividly apparent here, taking 
advantage of a serene camera and eerie solar 
lens flares. He expertly contrasts the slate gray 
interiors of human buildings with the literally 
otherworldly hues of the galaxy. Nearly every 
frame, whether simple aerial shots of the Earth 
surface or a windowed corridor on Mars, is 
picturesque. 
As aesthetically beautiful as it is, the wistful 
charm of “Ad Astra” comes from the details of its 
narrative. Among them are a harrowing rescue 
operation of a medical research ship, a freefall 
from the International Space Satellite near the 
film’s start and a spectacular chase sequence 
that can only be characterized as “Mad Max” on 

the moon. (I wouldn’t have minded if this part 
became the whole movie.) Many more of these 
details emerge in the film’s bracing, enigmatic 
final act that must be discovered for oneself. But 
Roy’s journey is a marvel in storytelling, suffused 
with operatic momentum. Every obstacle feels 
like a necessary sidestep, contributing a valuable 
spoke to the film’s narrative wheels. 
Pitt’s performance is nothing short of 
remarkable. The movie places him in the center 
of its every scene, and even in long cosmic 
stretches without dialogue or voiceover, his 
thoughts, 
confusions 
and 
anxieties 
seem 
tangible. He rides the line between conveying 
just 
enough 
to 
keep 
our 
eyes fixed on his and clearly 
holding 
back 
something 
vulnerable. 
Indeed, 
Roy’s 
vulnerability is a cagey and 
fleeting thing, appearing in 
the twitch of a cheek muscle 
here, 
a 
momentary 
pause 
before mentioning his dad’s 
name there. But whenever Pitt 
brings this quality out, it’s as 
much a relief from the pain as 
it is a foray into it. 
Between Roy McBride and 
Cliff Booth, Pitt’s recent role 
as a quirky, violent stuntman 
in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” he’s 
demonstrated how varied two quiet characters 
can be. Where Roy is an aching, convincing 
sympath, Cliff is wry and detached and want-
less. But neither character speaks much. The 
space between these laconic poles is, and has 
always been, the essence of Brad Pitt’s charisma. 
A compelling choice by Gray was to surround 
Roy with death. Death is the consequence for so 
many fellow astronauts Roy encounters, and the 
gravitas of that reality is unbearable for some. 
What makes a career marked by death different 
for him is not that he’s immune to emotion, but 
that he feels like he must be. Roy’s understanding 
of that ultimate price is messy, and watching 
this internal grapple is a genuinely affecting 
experience.
It’s safe to say that “Ad Astra” is my favorite 
movie of the year so far. I found every moment of 
the film as captivating as the last, and I left the 
theater a little more optimistic about the future 
of both movies and human civilization. What 
else could one want?

FILM REVIEW

This past Thursday, the University of Michigan’s Museum of Art 
and the Zell Visiting Writers Series hosted author Wayetu Moore to 
discuss her debut novel, “She Would Be King.” She started off the 
evening by discussing her dedication for the book. She spoke about 
the importance of her Liberian family, having moved to the U.S. 
from Liberia at the age of five. These roots were the inspiration for 
her novel. She did not return to the country until after she finished 
her novel. To write the book, she relied heavily on research and her 
earliest memories. 
The novel is set during the liberation of Liberia. In the mid-19th 
century, Liberia was the very first independent African country 
to form during the time of colonization. Moore’s three central 
characters have drastically different backgrounds; however, they all 
seem to utilize their differences to help them. 
I found the reading to be especially riveting, as Moore is a natural 
storyteller. The excerpt she read depicted a pregnant young woman 
attempting to hide the birth of her child because the child was 

cursed. Moore read with a refreshing passion, usually found more in 
performers than writers. 
The story follows three people all from different backgrounds, 
all deemed cursed by society. They all meet in the new nation of 
Liberia. The novel explores the African diaspora, community and 
the meaning of family. 
“The most profound thing I heard in this reading was just the way 
that she sought to honor her family as well as the narratives that 
were a part of her childhood,” Julia McDaniel, a graduate student in 
the Zell Writers’ Program, said. 
Moore’s writing style is packed with magical realism. Throughout 
the book, a magical wind guides the story along. It softens and 
personifies the harsh realities of life in tumultuous political times. 
After the event, Moore entered the UMMA atrium with grace and 
confidence far beyond her young age. She greeted the modest line 
of those wanting their book signed with eager and open kindness. 
Even though this is Moore’s debut novel, she is no stranger 
to activism — she has a nonprofit organization that publishes 
and distributes literature about underrepresented people to 
underprivileged areas. Her generosity was apparent in her tenacity 
of spirit during her reading. She was excited to share her culture 
with fellow writers.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

“Ad Astra”

The State Theatre

Walt Disney Studios 
Motion Pictures

Brittany Howard’s debut solo album, Jaime, 
marks a distinct artistic shift from her previous 
work with the Alabama Shakes. Jaime, in all 
its glory, is an experimental masterpiece. In 
these eleven tracks, Howard leads the audience 
through a medley of emotions and poignant 
life experiences, sourced directly from her 
own memories. Named for her sister, who 
passed away from cancer in her youth, Jaime 
is a journey through Howard’s life. Exploring 
a variety of themes — from racism to faith to 
the tribulations of love — Howard presents an 
authentic, powerful statement on the labors of 
our lives and how they shape us. 
The album opens with “History Repeats,” an 
upbeat, flowing song with hints of jazz influence 
and welcome doses of R&B, hip-hop flair. The 
song is an energetic opening to an album that is 
blunt and honest about the labors of Howard’s 
life. The song has an element of chaos — a 
reference to Howard’s artistic “breaking free” 
as she embraces the opportunity to branch out 
beyond her Alabama Shakes roots. The sounds 
of the song seem scrambled, but repetitive lyrics 
work to ground the track. Howard sings, “Hoo, 
I don’t want to go back there again” — as the 
ages-old lesson goes, we must learn from our 
mistakes, lest the past repeat itself. Howard’s 
lyrics go deeper, however, suggesting that 
personal growth is found in moving forward; 
The past can hold pain of trials overcome, and 
the false safety of slipping back to bad habits.
Howard wastes no time or effort in her 
debut album, embracing from the get-go 
experimentation and pushing her music to 
the far-flung corners of constricting “genre.” 
The song “13th Century Metal” is one of the 
more adventurous tracks in Jaime, structured 
as a speech or chant in the form of a protest. 
Howard repeats over and over, “I repeat, we 
are all brothers and sisters,” evoking a sense 
of power and urgency one would find in the 
midst of a rally. “He Loves Me” is similar in its 
lyrical form, its religious undertones turning to 
the song into an “alternative sermon.” Howard 
sings of her God loving her regardless of her life 
choices, “I know he still loves me when / I’m 
smoking blunts / Loves me when I’m drinking 
too much.” A contrast to organized religion’s 
historic campaign against so-called “sinners,” 
in a world where the sin of the church, and the 
sins of reality, have reached a radical dichotomy. 
What is most notable in the album, however, 

is how Howard approaches the concept of 
struggle in her songs. “Georgia” spins a tale of 
a young girl exploring her sexuality, having a 
crush on another young girl. As Howard sings 
“And I can’t help the way I was born to be / I 
ain’t no little boy,” what is emphasized is how 
normal the experience is. Howard doesn’t 
attempt to turn the song into anything more 
than a tale of a girlhood crush — it’s not about 
the fact that this girl is gay, but more so about 
the pivotal experience of growing up, and the 
pain of unrequited emotion. The “struggle” isn’t 
defining: It’s present, it’s there, but Howard’s 
music suggests that life is more than the 
struggle. It’s the experiences that count. People 
aren’t defined about all the bad in their life, and 
not all the good either — it’s how they have lived 
in totality that crafts a person from the murky 
clay into the person they are now. 
Jaime’s many moving parts come together at 
the album’s climax: “Short and Sweet.” Slow, 
beautiful and vulnerable, Howard sings of a 
blooming relationship muddled by the pain of 
reason and pesky logic. “I may be a fool to dream 
of you” croons Howard, notes reminiscent of 
jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald, “But, God, it 
feels so good to dream at all.” It’s easy to get 
bogged down by worries of the future, and 
anxiety is a familiar foe of the day-to-day. But, 
Howard reminds us how important it is to stay 
in the moment. We can’t let the lingerings of 
past pain, or the fear of future mistakes, bar 
us from living the life we have. While simple 
in its mechanics, the unbridled beauty of song 
is a beacon in an album that twists and turns 
through multiple experiences, styles, and 
structures. 
In the end, Howard’s Jaime is an undoubted 
success, both as a debut solo work, and for 
it’s 
incredibly 
poignancy 
and 
emotional 
authenticity. Listen to Jaime first for “Short 
and Sweet,” a song not easily forgotten. Then 
again, to enjoy Howard’s masterful writing and 
soul-rocking tunes. It ain’t easy handling what 
life throws at you, but with Howard by our side, 
things don’t seem so dismal after all.

MADISON —As Wisconsin 
running back Jonathan Taylor gal-
loped free late in the first quarter, 
shifting left, then speeding into the 
free terrain of the secondary, it all 
began to come into focus.
It was one play after Michigan punted 
the ball back, two plays after a way-
ward pass floated over the head of 
junior receiver Tarik Black and three 
plays after an acrobatic catch by soph-
omore Ronnie Bell was inexplicably 
nullified.
Taylor cruised into the end zone for a 
72-yard score, extending the Wiscon-
sin lead to 14-0, and effectively pulling 

the plug on a lifeless Wolver-

ines squad. At the time, the 

sequence appeared to be 

a momentous swing. 

In hindsight, it 

only expe-

dited 

the 

inevitable: a beatdown 
which will linger for 
the weeks and months 

to come. 
The Badgers followed 
Taylor’s lead, riding 203 

yards from the All-American 

running back, and 359 rushing 

yards overall, to a 35-14 drubbing on 

Saturday afternoon. 
“We just can’t play like this again, 
cause we’re gonna get our butts 
kicked every week,” said senior left 
tackle Jon Runyan after the game. 
“We just gotta be better.”
To attempt to pin down where it all 
went wrong would be to descend 
aimlessly into a black hole. Wiscon-
sin opened the game with an 11-play, 
75-yard touchdown drive, and never 
let off the gas. The Badgers scored 
touchdowns on three of their next 
five drives, going without a single 
three-and-out the entire first half. The 
Michigan offense countered with just 
126 yards and two turnovers in the 
first half. That was all she wrote.
As the half mercifully came to a close, 

Wisconsin players paraded into the 
tunnel, while the two teams barked at 
each other. One side evoked swagger; 
the other reeked of frustration. One 
side owned the football field; the 
other belonged anywhere but. 
Both knew the second half served as 
nothing more than a formality.
“When we went down 14, I looked 
around at a couple players dropping 
their heads and stuff,” said senior 
tight end Nick Eubanks. “We’re going 
to face adversity. It’s either going to 
knock us down and keep us there or 
we’re going to face it and tell it what’s 
good.”
An offense that supposedly spent the 
bye week reflecting and rebounding 
from a disappointing start to the 
season showed little evidence of the 
sort. Michigan’s 0-for-10 showing on 
third down marked the first time the 
Wolverines failed to convert on third 
down since at least 1995. After two 
inconsistent performances to start the 
year, Patterson completed just 6-of-16 
passes in the first half for 96 yards and 
an interception before being replaced 
by junior Dylan McCaffery to start the 

second half. The latter had to leave 

the game with a concussion late 

in the quarter. Neither evoked 

any sense of command.

“I think of it, as a whole 

group, we don’t have an 

identity yet,” Eubanks 

said. “It’s up to us 

to find our iden-

tity even though 
we’ve got a game 
coming up next 
Saturday. We’ve 
got to find it 
quick. We know 
the type of sea-
son, this is a long 
season. It’s a gut 
check.”
The statistical out-

comes paint a picture 

bleak enough. The defense 

allowed 359 rushing yards, 

its worst since a 42-13 loss to 

Ohio State in 2015. Prior to two late 
garbage-time touchdowns, the offense 
mustered one drive over 21 yards — 
and it ended in a fumble by junior Ben 
Mason near the goal line on his first 
carry of the season. 
Still, the numbers cannot fully 
encapsulate the scar this loss will 
leave. Michigan has now lost its last 15 
games on the road at top-15 oppo-
nents. It is 1-6 on the road against 
ranked teams in the Jim Harbaugh 
era, with Saturday’s just the most 
recent in the line of lackluster perfor-
mances in big games.
And that the problems Saturday were 
so frequent and pervasive means the 
ultimate blame must be thrust at the 
hands of one man.
As that figure — once larger than life, 
now a shell of that — sat at the table 
facing the media after the game, he 
looked around for a moment, waiting 
for someone to break the silence. Fi-
nally, provoked by a question, he said 
the only thing he could.
“We were outplayed. Out-prepared 
and outcoached,” Harbaugh said. 
“Outplayed. The whole thing. Both 
offensively and defensively. 
“It was thorough.”

M

ADISON — Among 
the many platitudes 
uttered after one of 
the worst losses Michigan has 
suffered in the Jim Harbaugh 
era was a pre-
vailing echo 
that this was 
not the end.
One loss 
in the Big 
Ten does 
not doom 
anybody, 
especially 
one to an out-
of-division 
opponent. 
There is still time to turn things 
around and meet whatever 
goals the Wolverines harbor.
“Everyone’s really deter-
mined and focused,” senior left 
tackle Jon Runyan Jr. said. “Our 
season’s not over.”
And technically speaking, 
he’s right. Michigan’s season 
is not over, at least not in the 
literal sense. Its goals of a Big 
Ten title, and even a College 
Football Playoff berth, are still 
in play. The team will not spend 
the next 10 weeks on a slow 
death march, waiting for the 
season to end and for a free trip 
to somewhere warm. 
But after Saturday, and Wis-
consin’s 35-14 beatdown of the 
Wolverines, it’s hard to believe 
it won’t end that way. Not 
because anyone is consigned to 
anything. But because of what 
we saw on the field — a team 
that, right now, can’t hang with 
the class of the Big Ten and isn’t 
particularly close to being able 
to do so.
It’s not that Michigan lost. 
It’s the way Michigan lost.
Josh Gattis’ offense, adver-
tised with #SpeedinSpace, 
looked overwhelmed, the only 
points coming in garbage time. 
Michigan’s defense was physi-
cally outmatched as Wisconsin 
ran for a collective 359 yards. 
Jonathan Taylor alone went 

for 203, more than any Michi-
gan player has run for over the 
entire season to this point. The 
Wolverines lost by three scores 
and the margin could have been 
larger had Wisconsin not taken 
its foot off the gas or had Taylor 
not missed some time with an 
injury.
After the game, there was 
talk of identity and improve-
ment. It meant about as much as 
the talk beforehand about mak-
ing a statement.
“It’s up to us to find an iden-
tity,” senior tight end Nick 
Eubanks said. “We got a game 
coming up next Saturday. We 
gotta find it quick.”
The bottom line is this: If 
you haven’t figured out your 

identity three games into the 
season, that problem can’t be 
solved with a press conference 
soundbyte.
It’s been six months since 
spring practice opened. It’s 
hard to believe six more days 
will make the ultimate differ-
ence.
An identity, it turns out, can-
not be reduced to a hashtag. 
Jim Harbaugh, Josh Gattis and 
Michigan have learned that les-
son the hard way.
As for the other side of the 
ball, the Wolverines at least 
seem to know what they want 
to be. The problem is, they’re 
nowhere near it.
“I think we pride ourselves 
on being the best defense in 

college football,” senior safety 
Josh Metellus said. “And these 
last couple weeks, we haven’t 
shown that.”
On Saturday, they showed the 
opposite. It’s easy to look at the 
stats and assume this was the 
Jonathan Taylor show. And to 
be sure, Taylor played as well 
as you’d expect, bouncing out of 
trouble for big gains more than 
once. But the Badgers ran the 
ball as well as they did because 
they dominated in the trenches. 
As much as the offseason focus 
centered on losing defensive 
ends Chase Winovich and 
Rashan Gary, losing Lawrence 
Marshall and Bryan Mone 
might have caused the most 
noticeable drop-off. 

The Wolverines don’t have 
the depth, size or strength to 
compete on the interior against 
a team like Wisconsin.
“We got our backs against 
the wall,” soph-
omore defen-
sive end Aidan 
Hutchinson 
said. “We just 
gotta fight.”
On Saturday, 
there was no 
fight. No will-
power and no 
physicality. The 
Wolverines got 
pushed around 
and bullied. 
Their 14 points came because 
Wisconsin decided not to kick 

them when they were down.
This team is talented — tal-
ented enough to live up to the 
hype that surrounded them for 
six months. But it showed noth-
ing on Saturday 
to indicate it 
can go to Penn 
State and win. It 
showed nothing 
to prove it can 
move the ball 
against a defense 
like Michigan 
State’s. Good 
luck beating 
Notre Dame or 
Ohio State play-
ing like it did 
against Wisconsin.
This doesn’t look like a Big 
Ten contender. It looks like a 
group on the fast track to 7-5. 
In the past, winning games 
against ranked teams has been 
the difference between a conso-
lation bowl and title contention. 
This year, it might be the dif-
ference between a consolation 
bowl and a flaming disaster — 
five of their remaining games 
are against top-25 teams.
There’s time to fix it, but 
there’s a lot to fix and an unfor-
giving schedule. 
“You guys weren’t in our 
huddle,” sophomore defensive 
end Aidan Hutchinson told 
the media at large. “You guys 
weren’t on the sideline with us. 
You guys don’t know what goes 
on in our defense.”
It’s true — Michigan doesn’t 
let the media into practice. We 
don’t know what’s said in the 
locker room and we’re nowhere 
near the sideline or huddle. But 
we do see the end product every 
Saturday. And that’s where the 
Wolverines have fallen woefully 
short.
If that doesn’t change, it’ll be 
a long 10 weeks ahead.

SportsMonday Column: Identity fraud

ALEXIS RANKIN/Daily
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has consistently struggled to beat ranked teams on the road, as exemplified by the Wolverines’ 35-14 loss at Wisconsin.

Running game absent in ugly loss

MADISON — On its first 
drive Saturday, Wisconsin rode 
its Heisman-candidate running 
back all the way down the field. 
On Michigan’s, it handed the 
ball to a converted defensive 
lineman who didn’t have a carry 
this year.
Jonathan Taylor scored a 
touchdown. Ben Mason lost 
a fumble. And that one drive 
was a perfect microcosm of the 
game as a whole.
The Wolverines came into 
Camp 
Randall 
Stadium 
on 
Saturday and got embarrassed, 
35-14. The reason for that can 
be summed up many ways, 
but one stat was particularly 
telling: Michigan had 40 yards 
rushing, Wisconsin had 359.
Two weeks ago against Army, 
the Wolverines averaged 2.4 
yards per carry. This week, they 
had 2.1. And suddenly, a team 
once known for its propensity 
to run the ball couldn’t run the 
ball.
“First 
three 
games, 
we 
haven’t been able to dictate 
the game and how we wanted, 
being able to throw the ball 
when we want, being able to run 
the ball,” said fifth-year senior 
offensive tackle Jon Runyan. 
“We got into tough situations.”
Junior 
quarterback 
Dylan 
McCaffrey was the Wolverines’ 
leading rusher. He ran for a 
game-high nine yards in a 
meaningless drive right before 
halftime before leaving with a 
concussion in the third quarter.
Taylor, meanwhile, gained 
more yards — 72 — on a 
touchdown run in the first 
quarter than Michigan did all 
game.
“When you play against us, 
we’re gonna stop the run,” 
said 
Wisconsin 
linebacker 
Chris Orr. “We’re gonna force 
you to play a one-dimensional 
offense, we’re gonna get after 
your quarterback and create 
turnovers.” 
That’s 
exactly 
what 
the 
Badgers did.
When you think of the 
Wolverines 
having 
a 
one-

dimensional 
offense, 
you’re 
probably thinking of one of the 
many big games in past years 
where Michigan ran the ball 
and ran it again, eschewing 
downfield passing and getting 
nowhere. Saturday, it was the 
exact opposite.
The Wolverines did have 
some success passing — actually 
finishing 
with 
259 
yards 
to 
Wisconsin’s 
128. 
Senior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 
had five completions of over 20 
yards, including a 68-yard pass 
to sophomore wide receiver 
Ronnie Bell, and another that 
was originally ruled a catch but 
controversially overturned.
Instead, the Badgers stopped 
the run in its tracks and forced 
Michigan into passing downs. 
After Mason’s red-zone fumble, 
the running game was feeble, all 
semblance of confidence gone. 
The offensive line struggled 
to 
open 
up 
holes 
against 
Wisconsin’s 
stout 
defensive 
front. 
And 
the 
fact 
that 
freshman running back Zach 
Charbonnet, 
was 
“limited,” 
according to Michigan coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, 
only 
made 
matters worse. The Wolverines 
turned to sophomore Christian 
Turner. But unlike Wisconsin, 
which kept up the ground-and-
pound even after Taylor briefly 
left the game due to cramps in 
the second quarter, Turner was 
quiet.
“It’s tough in those second 
and 
long, 
third 
and 
long 

situations when we’re not on 
the path we want to be on,” 
said fifth-year senior offensive 
tackle Jon Runyan. “And you 
get those second and long, third 
and longs it’s tough because 
you’re thrown off track and 
you’re gonna have to throw the 
ball.”
After the game, the Badgers 
talked about their gameplan, 
how they were confident they 
would dominate the line of 
scrimmage, how they rallied 
around 
the 
other 
running 
backs when Taylor left. They 
used words like “dynamic” and 
“explosive.”
Harbaugh, meanwhile?
“Things they did really well, 
we were unable to do as far as 
establishing a running game, 
having the play-action come off 
of that,” he said. “They blocked 
better, they tackled better, they 
had a better plan and executed 
it extremely well today.”
Last year, a Michigan team 
with the same All-Big Ten 
offensive linemen ran for 353 
yards — and ran Wisconsin off 
the field. A year later, it was the 
polar opposite.
When Harbaugh was asked 
what he wanted his team’s 
offensive identity to be, he 
answered: “To be able to run 
the ball and be able to throw the 
ball, both equally and effective 
and efficient.”
This time, it was the running 
game that was inexplicably 
absent.

Amid loss, WRs show their talent

MADISON — Tarik Black 
stopped on a dime, situated 
himself between two defensive 
backs 
and 
spotted 
Shea 
Patterson’s 
high-arching 
long ball. As it fell, he leapt 
to wrestle the ball from both 
defenders, securing a 32-yard 
gain and moving Michigan into 
Wisconsin territory.
It was exactly what the 
Wolverines 
had 
envisioned 
all 
offseason, 
using 
their 
physical, 
talented 
receiving 
corps to invigorate a dangerous 
downfield passing game.
One 
problem: 
Michigan 
trailed 35-8 with seven minutes 
left, and any hope of escaping 
Madison with a respectable 
result had long since dissipated.
On the worst day of his 
Michigan 
career, 
Shea 
Patterson’s passes were rarely 
where Black or Nico Collins 
or 
Donovan 
Peoples-
Jones 
would 
have 
wanted 
them, 
but 
it 
didn’t 
matter. 
They went up 
to 
pinpoint 
them 
anyway, 
out-jumping 
overmatched 
defenders 
and 
finding 
gaps 
in coverage where it seemed 
impossible to do so.
“(Made) 
some 
plays 
downfield,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “Both 
Nico, Tarik. Shea got the ball — 
we threw some deep balls and 
made some plays. Guys kept 
fighting.”
None of it mattered.
Because in the first half — 
back when there was some 
supposition Michigan might 
play decently — the Wolverines’ 
three star receivers combined 
for one catch and five yards on 
three targets.
Sophomore 
Ronnie 
Bell 
had 
a 
68-yard 
breakaway 
catch 
on 
Michigan’s 
first 
play. Good for him. But the 
Wolverines’ passing attack isn’t 

supposed to be built around 
a 
sophomore 
who 
finished 
as 
the 
212th-ranked 
wide 
receiver in his class and nearly 
played college basketball. Not 
when it has three NFL-caliber 
receivers, each of whom has 
proven his mettle when given 
the opportunity.
And 
yet, 
through 
three 
quarters, 
Bell 
had 
nine 
targets. 
The 
other three had 
five 
combined. 
Between 
Bell’s 
opening 68-yard 
catch 
and 
the 
start 
of 
the 
fourth 
quarter, 
Michigan’s 
passing 
offense 
— labeled as the backbone of 
an offensive revolution in the 
offseason 
— 
managed 
2.95 
yards per pass attempt on 22 
tries.
In 
the 
fourth 
quarter, 
when 
it 
targeted 
Black, 
Collins and Peoples-Jones 11 
times, that number rose to a 
respectable 7.41 before two 
late incompletions from third-
string quarterback Joe Milton.
“Yeah, 
most 
definitely,” 
said senior tight end Nick 
Eubanks, when asked whether 
the 
late-game 
explosiveness 
would impact the offense going 
forward. “We’ll see it on film 
and I believe the coaches will 
see it as well and we’ll go from 
there, in terms of who needs to 

get the ball and what we do on 
offense.”
Whenever 
players 
are 
posed with gameplan-related 
questions 
postgame, 
there’s 
a common theme to their 
responses. 
The 
gameplan, 
they say, is above their pay 
grade. They need to watch the 
film, they’ll tell you, before 
pinpointing the root of any 
struggles.
And it’s a fair response — 
mid-season strategic changes 
are 
typically 
nuanced 
and 
require 
more 
than 
a 
few 
minutes worth of reflection. 
So amid a sea of pre-packaged 
quotes about continuing to 
fight and keeping your head up 
and believing in your brothers, 
it stands out when Eubanks 
says change is needed.
Saturday evening, as the 
scar of Michigan’s loss began 
to form, the question shifted to 
its offensive identity. Fifth-year 
senior left tackle Jon Runyan 
said it’s “fair to say” they don’t 
have one. Harbaugh, after a 
start in which the Wolverines 
have rushed for 3.5 yards per 
carry, said, “To be able to run 
the ball, to be able to throw the 
ball both equally, effective and 
efficient.”
Eubanks, again notable for 
his candor, said, “I think of it, 
as a whole group, we don’t have 
an identity yet.”
Deep in the fourth quarter, it 
may have been sitting right in 
front of them.

Pearson not expecting another slow start

Mel Pearson sat down casually 
and focused on his next few 
words. 
He gestured with the flat of 
his hands, raising one inches 
from his chest area and the other 
to his eye level.
“You don’t want to take it from 
here,” the Michigan coach said, 
indicating the level of play with 
his hands’ positioning. “And all 
of a sudden, you play a game to 
here.”
Pearson was preparing his 
team for the start of the season. 
In a game, every aspect of hockey 
is ramped up — speed, strength, 
skill. The standards for a game 
could not be easily mimicked 
in practice. But that’s what 
the Michigan hockey team is 
striving for.
“We 
want 
the 
intensity,” 
Pearson said. “We want the 
pace. We want the speed up, and 
then hopefully, because if we get 
there, then the execution will 
stay there.”
High-octane 
practices. 
Stricter conditioning. Countless 
repetitions. 
The 
team 
did 
everything in its power to get 
as close to in-game conditions 
and as in shape as possible — 
for the sake of getting off to a 
strong start to the season. And 
that reason being, the last two 
seasons, the Wolverines have 
begun the year poorly. 
The previous two seasons 
under 
Pearson, 
Michigan 
amassed an 8-8-1-1 record with 
a loss to Bowling Green on New 
Year’s two years ago, and a 6-7-2-
3 in the same stretch of time last 
year. 
Even in years prior, dating back 
to Pearson’s tenure at Michigan 
Tech, his teams have struggled 
to start a season successfully. In 
2016-17, the year before Pearson 
departed for the Wolverines, 
the Huskies lost their first four 
games, starting the season 1-5-2 
— though they eventually turned 

the season around to get an 
NCAA Tournament bid.
It’s a problem Pearson’s aware 
of.
But this year, he anticipates a 
different result. 
“The 
first 
year, 
I 
can 
understand 
why 
with 
new 
systems and new coaches and a 
lot of different things going on,” 
Pearson said. “And last year, I 
can’t put my finger on it. I could 
give you a couple of my thoughts, 
but I don’t know if they’re 
correct or not. But having said 
that, I think I don’t anticipate 
that same issue this year. 
“Now, if you look at my record 
and the coaching record, we 
probably always got off a little bit 
slower and stronger as we go on.”

His first year, Pearson had to 
juggle coaching with learning 
new players, roles and teaching 
a completely new scheme. That 
meant 
experimenting 
early 
games to figure out which role 
fits whom best.
“Part of it, too, is just finding 
out what you have and who your 
team is, and trying to play guys, 
maybe in some situations you 
don’t know yet,” Pearson said. 
“And I’m a proponent of trying to 
see what we have in games and 
go from there, give every chance 
so to speak. 
“So, I don’t know if we will this 
year. I think we know a lot more 
about our team, and our players 
now when I first came in.”
The second year, the team 

chose 
to 
prioritize 
even 
strength play in practice early 
— but special teams would later 
come back to bite them. The 
Wolverines weren’t concerned 
with the power play and penalty 
kill early, because “it’s hard to 
get those things right off the get 
go.”
In addition to answering the 
special team concerns early this 
year, Pearson has gotten to know 
the team’s ins and outs. Time will 
tell if that will translate to live 
play in Pearson’s third season.
“I think it’s going to be a lot 
smoother transition in the start 
of season this year,” said senior 
forward 
Nick 
Pastujov, 
“as 
compared to maybe some other 
ones.”

Wolverines rebound in 
weekend tournaments

After 
last 
weekend’s 
disappointing 
season-opening 
tournament at the Napa Valley 
Tennis Classic, the Michigan 
men’s 
tennis 
team 
made 
a 
concerted effort to press the 
reset button. In two weekend 
tournaments — the Battle in the 
Bay Classic in San Francisco 
and the Farnsworth-Ivy Plus in 
Princeton — it showed.
“We went back and met as a 
team and had to really recharge 
and restart, get back to who we 
are as a team and what tennis is 
all about,” said Michigan coach 
Adam 
Steinberg. 
“The 
guys 
performed well this weekend, 
and it was a step forward for us, 
for sure.”
Across the two tournaments, 
Michigan singles players won 13 
of 23 matches and doubles pairs 
won 4 of 7, through midday on 
Sunday. Three additional singles 
matches went unreported. Such 
were the positive results that 
Steinberg was looking for in his 
team. 
No player made a bigger 
statement 
than 
freshman 
Ondrej Styler. Playing in his first 
collegiate 
tournament, 
Styler 
advanced through four rounds, 
all the way to the finals. 
“For Ondrej to play as well 
as he did was a terrific effort,” 
Steinberg said. “It was something 
we needed to jumpstart us. To do 
that in a tough, big environment 
with a lot of great teams — USC, 
TCU, Stanford, Cal — beating 
those guys, he did tremendous.”
The highly-touted recruit out 
of Prague showed both skill and 
determination on the court. In 
his first match, Styler persevered 
through 
two 
tiebreakers, 
winning, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4). He later 
advanced to the finals on the heels 
of another dramatic tiebreaker 
before ultimately falling to USC’s 
Brandon Holt, 6-2, 6-4. 

Across the country at the 
Farnsworth-Ivy Plus in Princeton, 
the duo of juniors Harrison 
Brown and Kristofer Siimar won 
their doubles tournament, posting 
a 3-0 record. After winning their 
opening match, 8-3, the pair never 
looked back. 
“We came out with a lot of 
energy and enthusiasm,” Brown 
said. “For me, I’ve really improved 
my mental game. I feel as if this 
tournament wasn’t as tough for 
me compared to the others from 
last year.”
While the official collegiate 
season doesn’t kick off until 
January, 
participating 
in 
tournaments 
offers 
several 
benefits 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
among 
them 
competitive 
gameplay and an opportunity to 
work on certain skills. Specifically, 
Steinberg wants his players to 
come together as a team, buying 
into the importance of coherence 
and collectivity. 
When it comes to formulating a 
team culture, Brown can already 
sense a notable difference in this 
year’s coming faster than that of 
yesteryear.
“I have a really good feeling 
about this group of guys,” Brown 
said. “We’ve come out of the 
summer a lot stronger compared 
to last summer. We have the 
ability to make a big impact on the 
national stage.”
Making 
such 
an 
impact 
and 
winning 
championships 
is certainly the end goal for 
Michigan. Steinberg insists that 
winning is inevitable so long as a 
strong team foundation is first in 
place. 
“Right now, we’re trying to 
just develop,” Steinberg said. “We 
talk about it everyday. It’s not the 
most exciting thing, but trying to 
develop a championship culture 
in our program in every way is our 
goal. We don’t talk about rankings 
and championships right now. 
Just a big culture, because now 
we’re just trying to get better.”

Offense can’t capitalize on potential

It was textbook team play 
that 
allowed 
the 
Michigan 
men’s soccer team an early lead.
From inside his own box, 
senior forward Jack Hallahan 
set up junior midfielder Marc 
Ybarra, starting a chain of 
beautiful 
passes 
between 
Hallahan, Ybarra and freshman 
forward 
Christian 
Pulselli. 
The flawless build-up ended 
with a cross to fifth-year senior 
Nebojsa Popovic who buried the 
ball in the back of the net on the 
opposite end.
Only 
two 
minutes 
after 
kickoff, the pitch-length run 
and resulting goal gave the 
Wolverines an early one-goal 
lead. But that was the only 
offensive 
production 
that 
Michigan (0-0-1 Big Ten, 3-2-2 
Overall) could muster in a rain-
shortened 1-1 draw to Rutgers 
(0-0-1 Big Ten, 5-0-2 Overall).
“We want to see if we can 
be aggressive early and get 

after teams and make them 
uncomfortable,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “We want 
to state our intentions by our 
approach.” 
The early game success wasn’t 
unusual for the Wolverines, who 
have scored a goal in the first 15 
minutes in both of their past 
two matches.
That much, 
the team has 
done, 
but 
sustained 
success 
has 
been 
lacking 
through seven 
games.
The 
opportunities 
are there, just 
not the goals. 
Michigan finished the game 
with nine shots, five of which 
were on target.
“We had some really really 
great chances and I wish one 
of them snuck in,” Daley said. 
“One’s in the goalie’s hands, is it 
over the line, ref protects him a 

little bit. Two one (versus) ones 
inside the box, keeper makes an 
amazing, amazing two saves, 
seems to happen to us a lot.” 
Retaining momentum after 
the goal was an issue for the 
Wolverines, 
who 
seemed 
sluggish after their initial push. 
It took until after the half for 
them to reapply 
pressure on the 
Scarlet 
Knights’ 
defense. Just as 
the 
chemistry 
between 
Hallahan, Popovic 
and 
sophomore 
forward 
Derick 
Broche 
was 
heating 
up 
again, the game 
was 
delayed 
by 
severe weather and then called 
outright, leaving 18 minutes on 
the clock and the trio without a 
much-needed goal.
Despite the disappointment 
of not finding a go-ahead goal, 
Daley 
had 
largely 
positive 
takeaways from a tie in the first 
Big Ten matchup of the year.
“We’re still creating chances 
and we’re off to a good start,” 
Daley said. “We are what we 
are.” 
As Daley knows, though, 
Michigan is going to have to 
capitalize on these chances 
to have success this year. The 
team was controlling the game 
against a strong Rutgers squad, 
and a win would have been a 
boost going into conference 
play.
It all comes down to what the 
team can do with those chances.
“When 
we 
look 
at 
big 
moments, when we think about 
the game we always talk about 
there’s big moments in every 
half” 
Daley 
said. 
“There’s 
probably three or four big 
moments in every half. Do you 
win those moments?”
In 
this 
matchup, 
the 
Wolverines were only able to 
win one of these moments. 
The team has talent and their 
head coach is pushing the right 
mentality, 
but 
the 
question 
remains — can they turn these 
moments into points on the 
scoreboard? 

‘M’ starts strong, ends in 1-1 draw

Imagine a textbook give-
and-go 
around 
a 
Rutgers 
defender, a hard pass into the 
middle of the box, and an easy 
tap-in by the Wolverines and 
that’s 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
soccer team only goal no 
more than 120 seconds into 
the game. In a combination of 
deadly passes, Michigan sliced 
easily through the right side 
of the Rutgers defense and 
seemed poised to continue that 
momentum into the rest of the 
game. 
Michigan (3-2-2) struck early 
during its first Big Ten matchup 
against No. 24 Rutgers, yet 
fell victim to a penalty kick 
and then lightning as weather 
forced the game into an early 
ending, 70 minutes in at 1-1. 
Michigan’s only goalscorer 
of the night was fifth-year 
senior 
forward 
Nebojsa 
Popovic, who now has five 
goals on the season. Popovic 
led the Michigan attack in 
keeping a high press against 
the Rutgers defense from the 
very beginning of the game, 
and 
eventually 
transformed 
that pressure into his second-
minute goal. Fellow forwards 
Jack Hallahan and Christian 
Pulselli, were both credited 
with assists.
“We want to see if we 
can be aggressive early and 
get after teams and make 
them 
uncomfortable 
and 
its been successful for us,” 
said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. “We want to state our 
intentions by our approach and 
I think we’ve done that.”
The 
Wolverines 
kept 
a 

strong hold on the midfield and 
limited the Scarlet Knights to 
only a few offensive chances in 
the first 20 minutes. But while 
defending a Rutgers corner 
in the 24th minute, senior 
defenseman 
Abdou 
Samake 
committed a foul inside the box 
and senior goalkeeper Andrew 
Verdi could do nothing to stop 
the penalty from sailing into 
the right side of the net. 
The Rutgers goal changed 

the flow of the game and 
successfully 
slowed 
the 
momentum Michigan had built 
in the opening minutes to a 1-1 
halftime score. The Wolverine 
defense was increasingly under 
attack, 
while 
the 
midfield 
struggled to keep possession 
of the ball due to sloppy passes 
and frequent turnovers all over 
the field. The teams entered the 
locker rooms even and needing 
to come out strong. 
“While 
they 
had 
more 
possession 
in 
the 
first 
half, I don’t think we were 
uncomfortable in any shape or 
form,” Daley said.
Michigan seemed to rise 
to the challenge, and four 
minutes into the second half 
sophomore 
forward 
Derick 
Broche managed to put the ball 
into the goal but it was called 
back as he had kicked the ball 
out of the goalkeeper’s hands. 
However, 
soon 
after 
that 
chance the game settled into 
what it was in the first half- an 
even battle with close chances 

and scares for both teams. 
In the 60th minute, Popovic 
re-entered 
the 
game 
and 
re-energized 
the 
Michigan 
attack, pressing the defense 
and 
quickly 
creating 
two 
opportunities 
for 
Broche 
and 
junior 
forward 
Umar 
Farouk Osman. But, by the 
70th minute, lightning and 
rain in the area stopped any 
more offensive chances when 
officials stopped play. A thirty 
minute weather delay led to 
play resuming for about two 
minutes before storms initiated 
a second weather delay that 
saw the match called 1-1.
“Both teams really wanted 
to finish the game,” Daley said. 
“I think we really wanted to a 
little bit more because we were 
kind of responding to a sluggish 
first half. But we weren’t 
poor by any stretch because 
in reality their only shot on 
goal was a PK, ... We gotta live 
with what we have, we are who 
we are, and just keep rolling 
through the season.”

Michigan’s 
offense

MADISON — For a fleeting moment 
on Saturday, as Ronnie Bell streaked 
across an open field and into an 
unmanned secondary with only green 
grass ahead of him, it seemed like 
everything might be OK.
Bell eyed the end zone and all those 
concerns about senior quarterback 
Shea Patterson ameliorated. He ran 
towards it, and the noise around 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis 
dissipated. He got pushed out of 
bounds at Wisconsin’s 7-yard line 
and it didn’t matter, because this was 
speed in space, the kind of up-tempo 
juggernaut that can go into a place like 
Madison and throw a defense like the 
Badgers off their game. 
Two 
plays 
later, 
Ben 
Mason 
fumbled. Wisconsin recovered and 
the Wolverines snapped out of their 
haze — falling into an ugly reality that 
engulfed them for the game’s next 53 
minutes.
Patterson left the game at halftime 
after an abominable start. He came 
back in later on and finished by 
completing less than half of his passes. 
Backup quarterback Dylan McCaffrey 
was lucky not to be intercepted 
numerous times, then left the game 
himself with a concussion. Receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones, in his much-
anticipated return from injury, got 
hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalty early that took away more 
yards than his lone catch gained. 
Collectively, eight rushers combined 
for 40 yards on 19 carries. Take out the 
negative-9 yards Jon Runyan Jr. got on 
an ill-fated Patterson decision under 
pressure and it balanced out to 49 on 
18, or 2.72 per carry.
Michigan scored 14 points and had 
299 total yards. All 14 of those points 
came once Wisconsin had gone up 35-0 
and 128 of those yards came in the 
fourth quarter, well after the student 
section had started to flood out, 
getting an early start on celebrating a 
statement win.
“We just can’t play like this again, 
cause we’re gonna get our butts kicked 
every week,” Runyan said, and it 
doesn’t take a football expert to see 
that he’s right.
Call it a result of changing schemes 
— and senior tight end Nick Eubanks 
did — but the Wolverines had all spring, 
fall camp, two games and a bye week to 
get used to Gattis’ offense, which was 
advertised as simple. At this point, the 
learning curve is barely a valid excuse.
Call it a result of personnel or not 
having enough talent, but this is a group 
that returned a senior quarterback, 
four starters on a good offensive line 
and three NFL-caliber receivers (all 
of whom were healthy on Saturday). 
There’s nothing inherently wrong with 
that.
Call it a result of Gattis, a first-time 
play caller, walking into a situation 
in which he may not be ready for and 
struggling at the first sign of trouble. 
But the tape of the first two games 
showed open passes left on the field, 
and Eubanks alluded Saturday to 
“things we missed and opportunities 
we had.”
Or you could do what Jim Harbaugh 
did, and acknowledge that this is not 
one problem. On every level, Wisconsin 
was just better, and on every level, 
Michigan must improve.
“We were outplayed,” Harbaugh 
said. 
“Out-prepared, 
outcoached, 
outplayed.”
Patterson has yet to look himself in 
three games. The offensive line has 
repeatedly struggled, leaving Patterson 
out to dry and putting running back 
Zach Charbonnet into situations where 
a two-yard gain constitutes success. 
Those three NFL-caliber receivers — 
Peoples-Jones, Nico Collins and Tarik 
Black — combined for three targets and 
five yards through Michigan’s opening 
drive of the second half on Saturday. 
When the Wolverines lined up to punt 
after that drive, down 28-0, the TV 
camera cut to Harbaugh uttering an 
expletive.
What else could he do?
A couple hours later, a reporter 
asked Harbaugh about the identity he 
wants for the offense.
“To be able to run the ball, to be 
able to throw the ball both equally, 
effective and efficient,” Harbaugh said. 
“Definitely little things that we gotta 
do and we gotta do better.”
Thus far, all the offense has been 
able to show is short glimpses of what it 
could be. Like Bell’s on Saturday, those 
don’t amount to much in the long run.

M

ADISON — Ten days 
ago, Don Brown stood 
in front of reporters, 
flashing his trademark energy and 
easily consumable sound bites to 
appease an apprehensive fanbase.
Amid his playful acts and posi-
tive reinforce-
ment, the 
criticism came. 
Michigan had 
given up 21 
points to a pair 
of unranked 
teams at home 
so the question 
naturally fol-
lowed: How are 
you going to 
stop Wisconsin?
Brown’s response was not to 
worry. Sure, Michigan struggled 
for stretches against a pair of 
teams that finished 79th and 62nd 
in yards per game a year ago. But 
Wisconsin — 31st in that category 
— ran a familiar offense, so the 
Wolverines shouldn’t have any 
trouble stopping them.
“I’ve been writing Wiscon-
sin cards and I’ve kinda been 
‘Woohoowoo!’ because I can whip 
them out like that!” Brown said at 
the time. “Because it’s all the stuff 
our guys know and are comfortable 
with. And we’ll jump in at a high 
level, without question.”
So, about that.
For two and a half quarters Sat-
urday afternoon, before the Bad-
gers elected in favor of empathy, 
Michigan had to count any play 
that didn’t end in a first down as a 
revelatory success.
At that media availability last 
week, Brown was asked to address 
the concern that the Wolverines 
couldn’t handle Wisconsin’s vaunt-
ed run game, led by All-American 
back Jonathan Taylor.
Brown’s response: “Bunch of 
crap.”
Wisconsin finished with 57 car-
ries for 359 yards and five touch-

downs.
Where, then, was the prepa-
ration that Brown talked about 
before the game?
Ask those on the field and the 
answer’s clear — not on Michigan’s 
sideline. When senior safety Josh 
Metellus was asked how the Wol-
verines let Taylor romp for 203 
yards, his response, before a pause, 
was one word: “Scheme.”
“They came in with a differ-
ent type of scheme than they did 
last year,” Metellus continued. “… 
They ran more of a double-counter 
(guard-tackle) type of scheme, try-
ing to get the cutback lanes. Say 

they’d try to run to the left, we’d 
overflow it, try to get their cutback 
through the A-gap or something 
like that.”
Metellus wouldn’t outright say 
that Michigan failed to adjust, 
but when you give up five rush-
ing touchdowns in the first seven 
drives, the implication is clear.
In the Wisconsin locker room, 
candor was in greater supply.
“We knew the pressures that 
were coming,” said Badgers left 
tackle Cole Van Lanen. “We 
watched a lot of film and we got 
to shut those things down early so 
they stopped running them and 
then they’re getting a lot of base 
defense.”
All of this, about the defense 
that’s regarded as the hallmark 

of the Jim Harbaugh-Don Brown 
era. The defense that’s ranked top 
three nationally in yards allowed 
per game since Harbaugh arrived 
in 2015, sure. But also the defense 
that has played 10 games at top-20 
teams or home vs. top-10 teams 
under Don Brown and given up an 
average of 31.9 points.
So when the Wolverines describe 
this as an uncharacteristic perfor-
mance, they’re not wrong, they’re 
just off by 3.1 points.
Still, there’s optimism in the 
Michigan locker room.
“You look at the defense, we 
have a lot of good guys,” said 
sophomore defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson.
Hutchinson isn’t wrong. He’s 
one of those good guys, a disrup-
tive force whether he lines up at 
tackle or end. Josh Uche and Kwity 
Paye are dynamic threats off the 
end. Lavert Hill and Josh Metellus 
are NFL players in the secondary.
Running down the roster, 
though, misses the point. No one 
on this defense is a likely first 
round pick. You know who was? 
Jabrill Peppers, Taco Charlton, 
Devin Bush and Rashan Gary. 
Jourdan Lewis, Delano Hill, Chase 
Winovich and David Long were all 
selected in the first three rounds.
And yet, all of those players have 
walked out the doors of Schem-
bechler Hall without a win against 
Ohio State or in a New Years’ Six 
bowl. They walked out without 
even notching a top-20 road win, 
members of a defense that failed to 
hold up its end of the bargain when 
it mattered most.
So, with Michigan down 28-0 
after two quarters and yet another 
big-game loss looming, what was 
Don Brown’s message?
“We treated the game 0-0 at 
halftime,” Hutchinson said.
Not with this defense.

We got to shut

Identity 
makes 
difference 
for Badgers

MADISON — No matter who 
you asked, there was a phrase that 
reverberated through the Wisconsin 
press room Saturday afternoon.
“We 
just 
played 
Wisconsin 
football.”
There’s a very specific style the 
Badgers are known for. It’s physical, 
bruising 
football, 
with 
a 
stout 
running game, a steady stream of 
overpowering offensive linemen and 
a lockdown defense. Done right, every 
opponent slowly has the life sucked 
out of it. For years, they haven’t 
deviated, and there’s a reason: it 
works.
It certainly worked Saturday. The 
linemen opened up gaping holes for 
Jonathan Taylor to burst through. 
Wisconsin ran three times as much as 
Michigan and gained 319 more yards 
on the ground. The defense pitched a 
shutout through the third quarter and 
wound up with a blowout, 35-14.
As the Wolverines were on the 
other side of the stadium, talking 
about how they didn’t yet have an 
identity, the Badgers made one thing 
clear: they know exactly who they are. 
Last year, in a 38-13 Michigan win, 
the Wolverines did their thing and it 
showed. This time, it was Wisconsin’s 
turn to return the favor.
“Last year is not who we was,” said 
Wisconsin safety Reggie Pearson. 
“And coming in this year, every 
opponent that we get, break them 
down from first quarter to fourth.”
This was a team assured of itself 
from beginning to end, a team that 
noticed from the first drive — when 
the Badgers went for it on fourth 
down at their own 34 — that the guys 
on the other side weren’t quite the 
same way.
Back 
on 
Tuesday, 
senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson tried to 
make people feel the same way about 
Michigan. “We’re gonna go out there 
and make a statement,” he said, and 
Wisconsin was listening. The Badgers 
had something of their own to say.
Linebacker Chris Orr told his team 
about Patterson’s proclamation all 
week, preparing to give him a test he 
didn’t see coming. When asked after 
the game who made a statement, Orr’s 
response went without saying: “We 
did.”
“We were just trying to make 
a statement that we were gonna 
dominate in the line of scrimmage 
up front and you prepare for that,” 
Taylor said. “You know coming in 
here, the University of Wisconsin, 
they’re gonna run the ball.”
Wisconsin 
proved 
that 
what 
Patterson had so confidently said 
was just a bunch of empty words, that 
you can’t make a statement without 
knowing exactly what that statement 
is going to be.
After the Badgers converted that 
first fourth down, they marched 
down the field, bludgeoning the 
Wolverines’ defense with Taylor, 
scoring a touchdown and eating 
clock. Wisconsin put Michigan on 
watch, showed the Wolverines this 
was its identity. Then it went back to 
that, again and again.
When Taylor went down with 
cramps in the second quarter, it 
didn’t matter. There were other 
running backs waiting in the wings, 
and Michigan couldn’t stop them, 
either. 
The 
Badgers 
went 
all-in 
on their offensive line, sometimes 
putting seven or eight linemen in on 
short yardage, daring the Wolverines 
to stop the run and knowing they 
wouldn’t. 
The 
defense 
knew 
it 
could force an offense to be one-
dimensional, and it did that, too. This 
time, it was by stopping the run and 
forcing Michigan to pass, knowing 
that on third- and fourth-and-long, it 
could only do so much.
Wisconsin 
fans 
chanted 
“overrated” 
two 
separate 
times, 
knowing fully that the Wolverines 
weren’t what they said they were. But 
the Badgers like to think it was more 
than just that.
“I’m sure people would say that 
Michigan lost the game instead of us 
winning the game, so we don’t care 
about that,” Orr said. “We’re gonna 
have the same goal next week and the 
week after that until the end of the 
season, just dominating whoever we 
line up against.”
Michigan didn’t have an identity 
Saturday. Wisconsin did.
The difference has never been 
more clear.
