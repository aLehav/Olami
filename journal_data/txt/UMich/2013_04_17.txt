For the Daily
Gerald Ford - a U.S. naval
veteran, University alum and
38th president of the United
States - was honored Tuesday
with a statue in the Great Hall

of the Ford School of Public Pol-
icy at the University.
The statue, modeled after the
one standing in the U.S. Capi-
tol building, was unveiled on
the centennial of Ford's birth.
Around 100 people were on
hand to watch Dean of the Ford
School Susan Collins, Brigadier
General Brent Scowcroft, a for-
mer advisor to Ford, and Mike
Ford, the former president's
son, speak.
Collins began the event with

a moment of silence, honor-
ing the victims of the Boston
Marathon before thanking
the attendees for coming and

statue.
Collins said Public Policy
students should start a new tra-
dition in regards to the statue.
"As you pass to and from
your classrooms, you might just
reach out and touch our spe-
cial statue of President Ford,"
Collins said. "I suspect he will

bring each of you good luck
when you do so."
Collins said she hopes the
statue will inspire students to
continue to address the world's
policy problems.
"While we can never do all
that we might wish, we must
always do what we can," she
said, quoting Ford. "It is my
hope that this statue right here
in our great hall, will inspire all
members of our community and

Harvard response criticized

AWARDl AWE

Harvard University stu-
dents were critical of their
administration's slow corn-
munication efforts following
the bombings at the Boston
Marathon, The Harvard
Crimson reported Tuesday.
While the two explo-
sions occurred at 2:50 p.m.,
the administration did not
e-mail the Harvard com-
munity about the incidents
until 5:17 p.m.
Harvard student Chris-
topher Walleck said that the
administration should have
communicated to the stu-
dents earlier.
"I hadn't received so
much as a single message

from Harvard saying, 'Stay
in your dorms,' or 'Be safe,'
or simply whatto be mindful
of,' Walleck said.

NEWS BRIEFS
ROYAL OAK, Mich.
Royal Oak residents
to vote to ban
discrimation
Residents of the Detroit sub-
urb of Royal Oak are expected
to vote in November on a human
rights ordinance that would
make it illegal to discriminate
based on sexual orientation and
a number of other factors.
Monday night's 7-0 vote by
the Royal Oak City Commis-
sion came after a petition drive
blocked the ordinance from
going into effect.
The City Commission
approved the human rights
ordinance on a 6-1 vote March
4. Resident Fred Birchard later
submitted petitions with enough
signatures seeking repeal of the
law, leaving the commission to
decide whether to repeal it or let
voters decide.
DALLAS
American Airlines
grounds flights for
several hours
A computer system used to run
many daily operations at Ameri-
can Airlines failed Tuesday,
forcing the nation's third-larg-
est carrier to ground all flights
across the United States for sev-
eral hours and stranding thou-
sands of frustrated passengers at
airports and on planes.
Flights already in the air were
allowed to continue to their desti-
nations, but planes on the ground
from coast to coast could not take
off. And travelers could do little
to get back in the air until the
computer system was restored.
American blamed its reserva-
tion system, which is used for
much more than booking flights.
Airlines commonly rely on such
systems to track passengers and
bags, update flight schedules
and gate assignments and file
flight plants. The computers also
help determine how much fuel
to put in an aircraft or which
seats should be filled to balance
a plane.
BISMARK, N.D
North Dakota
outlaws abortions
after 20 weeks
Republican Gov. Jack Dal-
rymple signed into law a mea-
sure that outlaws abortions
after 20 weeks of pregnancy
based on the disputed premise
that at that point a fetus can feel
pain.
The law signed Tuesday is the
latest among a raft of measures
passed in North Dakota this ses-
sion that are meant to challenge
the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe v. Wade ruling that legal-
ized abortion up until viability,

usually at 22 to 24 weeks.
Abortion-rights advocates
have called the laws blatant-
ly unconstitutional and have
promised a long legal fight that
they say the state can't win.
PESHAWAR, Pakistan
Former Pakistani
ruler ousted from
re-election bid
High court judges disquali-
fied former Pakistani military
ruler Pervez Musharraf on
Tuesday from running in the
parliamentary election, likely
ending any hope of a political
comeback.
The ruling was the latest blow
for Musharraf, who has faced
paltry public support, a raft of
legal challenges and Taliban
death threats since he returned
to Pakistan last month after
years in self-imposed exile.
Many experts predicted this
would be Musharraf's fate if
he came back and have been
scratching their heads at what
drove his decision. Some have
speculated he misjudged how
much public backing he would
get, while others guessed he was
simply homesick.

Daily wire reports.

crew team and ultimate Frisbee
team at the University.
LSA senior Alex Joboulian
was studying political. sci-
ence at the University. He
was an active member of the
Armenian Student Cultural
Association ' and Indepen-
dent Students for Liberty.
Joboulian, who was in his last
semester here, was awarded a
posthumous degree from the
University.
LSA sophomore Colleen
Mitchel passed away on
March 4, eight days before
her 20th birthday. She was
majoring in psychology at the
University, played club field
hockey and was involved in
Best Buddies, a campus orga-
nization that pairs students
with Washtenaw County resi-
dents who have intellectual
or developmental disabilities.
Mitchel aspired to become an
occupational therapist, a field
that often aids individuals
with disabilities.
Engineering sophomore
Maxime Pouokam died on Oct.

2 at the age of 20. He was a resi-
dent of Rochester Hills, Mich.,
but his family is originally
from Cameroon. Pouokam was
known for his participation in
the African Student Associa-
tion and his love of computer
science and music.
Though most families hold
private ceremonies shortly
after the respective passings,
Rev. Reid Hamilton, former
president of the ARC, said the
service is valuable in allowing
the families to remember their
loved ones as part of a larger
community.
"This is a gathering that is
particularly oriented towards
the University as a commu-
nity - towards remembering
the students who have been a
part of our lives and devoted
so much of their own lives and
energies to the work of service
and learning on this campus,"
Hamilton said.
The ceremony included
three readings: one from the
Koran, one from the Bible
and a secular poem. Despite
the participation of the ARC,
Hamilton said the event "was
not intended to be a specifi-
cally religious ceremony."

"We try to incorporate the
religious traditions of the
students themselves - if any
- and be intentional about rec-
ognizing the diversity of the
campus community," Hamil-
ton said.
Assistant Dean of Students
Sarah Daniels, the event's orga-
nizer, said the University holds
the memorial to complement
the private services held by
families, honoring the students
within the context of the Uni-
versity.
"I think that the goal is to
recognize that we are a uni-
versity community," Daniels
said. "This was to honor them
as members of the University
community and to recognize
that the community comes
together - acknowledging that
there are others going through
the grief process."
Daniels said families are
notified of the event at the
beginning of the winter term,
but are not in any way obligated
to attend. Families also have
the choice of asking that their
loved one be excluded from
the ceremony, but Daniel said
no family has ever made this
request.

FORD
From Page 1A
everyone who sees it, but espe-
cially our students, to always do
what they can."
Brigadier General Scowcroft,
who served as the national
security advisor under Ford and
President George H.W. Bush,
spoke on Ford's achievements
and struggles while in office.
Scowcroft stressed that Ford
was the only president who did
not intentionally seek the office,
as he became president only
after Nixon resigned, emphasiz-
ing Ford's commitment to the
United States.
"His objectives were simple."
Scowcroft said. "The United
States comes first."
Mike Ford recalled the hard-
ships his family faced during
the Vietnam Was and spoke of
how grateful he and his family

were for the statue and the cen-
tennial reception.
"It just gives me goose bumps
to stand in this place, this hall,"
Ford said. "He's looking down
on all of us."
Ford said he was proud.of his
father's in-office accomplish-
ments.
"It is that man, the same man
that led this country through
some very challenging times
and he loved our nation passion-
ately," Ford said. "He had tre-
mendous courage, tremendous
compassion and integrity as a
public servant. And he loved the
University of Michigan."
When asked what he would
hope students would think of
when passing his father's stat-
ue, Ford responded: public ser-
vice.
"Public service is the thing he
represents in his life," Ford said.
"He's really about serving our
nation for the greater good."



LIBERTY
From Page 1A
street" because "there isn't any
reason to wander down there
now."
Businesses that are most suc-
cessful on the block are destina-
tion businesses, which people
seek out for a specific product
or cuisine and have historically
lined the streets and filled the
storefronts. The law of retail
gravitation explains how big
anchor stores draw custom-
ers - like a gravitational pull
- to other shopping locations,
Kinnear said. He explained
that is why shopping centers
and malls always have large
chain retail stores, like Nord-
strom and Macy's.
"Borders was a big loss in
that regard," Kinnear said. "For
the most part, it's fairly minor
disruption that's going on."
Kinnear added that "retail
can be the difference between
massivefoot traffic and very
little."
Though there are some
retail spaces, none of the
storefronts are boarded up,
which indicates that the street
is not devastated, Kinnear
said. Further down the East
Liberty block, toward Main
Street, most of the storefronts
are filled, since those busi-
nesses cater to the reliable
customer base of business
professionals.
Kinnear compared the situ-

ation on East Liberty to the
nature of business on South
University Avenue. Foot traffic
patterns on South University
have fluctuated over the past
20 years as the street has also
lost main-attraction stores.
However, high-rise, apart-
ment buildings, such as Land-
mark and Zaragon Place, have
increased the foot traffic on
South University as students
walk to classes on Central Cam-
pus.
Justin Hana, general man-
ager at Tropical Smoothie Cafe
- which opened on East Liber-
ty near Maynard Street in Sep-
tember 2012 - said foot traffic
in the area is slow.
"Most (students) stay more
towards campus because they
have no reason to come out this
way," Hanna said.
Hanna said customers some-
times stop by his restaurant
on their way to Main Street.
He hopes as the weather gets
warmer, foot traffic in his store
will increase.
He referred to the myth on
the block is that the strip is
"cursed" because not a lot of
students shop in that area.
"They don't want to do the
extra walking, especially when
it's cold out," Hanna said.
"We're here to stay."
Alyssa Tangney, manager
of the Douglas J. Salon on
East Liberty near Thomp-
son Street, said she has not
noticed a decrease in foot
traffic and her business has

been steady.
Tangney added that her
salon attracts a wide customer
base from students to families
to professionals who are not
necessarily from the immedi-
ate area.
Bill McClelland, owner of
Encore Records - located on
East Liberty near Thomp-
son Street - said the past two
businesses that have occupied
the space next to his store
closed within a year of open-
ing. McClelland has been with
Encore Records since it opened
in 1989 and said he has seen
the block transform over the
years. He added that there is
an increase in coffee shops and
restaurants, which sometimes
make the block look like "a mall
food court."
"I'm nostalgic for the time
when there were more book-
stores and more music stores,"
McClelland said. "It had more
character; it seems like it's a
little more sterile than it used
to be. There are not a lot of
mercantile business where
people sell things other than
food."
McClelland said his store
attracts an "alternative crowd,"
whereas Borders attracted
a "loyal" customer base that
extended down the block. He
added that parking has been a
barrier to entry for some cus-
tomers who are reluctant to pay
for it and can't find street spots.
"That, to some people, is a
deal breaker."

CLINIC
From Page 1A
free clinic.
Fundraising will be a vital
source of income for the clinic,
especially with its new rent,
which is much higher than the
previous location which was
$1 per year. The rent for the
new library space is close to
$2,000.
Goldman, along with his
wife Laura Goldman, said they
hope to find a permanent loca-
tion in the same area. Most of
their patients live within a 10-
to 15-mile radius of Pickney.
The clinic was and will con-
tinue to be completely free for
patients.
"We don't take a penny from
any of our patients," Goldman
said. "We don't take forms;
there's no insurance forms;
there's no money changing
hands.'It's basically pure medi-
cine. We come in, we take care
of them and we follow them as
needed.".
Goldman added that the
greatest advantage of sourc-
ing the clinic out of the library
building is the larger space it
provides.
"One of the problems with
the old clinic was that it was so
small. We were bumping into
each other," Goldman said.
New programs are also
being introduced upon the
reopening of the clinic. Uni-
versity Social Work students
will provide social services
and assistance programs for
patients and help increase
patient access to prescrip-
tions, and plans for University

Dental School students to pro-
vide dental care for patients
are also underway.
Medical School student
Eytan Shtull-Leber, a co-
director of the clinic, said he
misses seeing the patients at
the clinic because he formed
strong ties while treating
them.
"It'sbeen tough over the past
couple months mainly because
we just haven't been able to see
patients," Shtull-Leber said.
"It's why we all got into it, why
we all got into medical school
and why we all decided to vol-
unteer with the clinic."
Hari Conjeevaram, an asso-
ciate professor of medicine
and the clinic's medical direc-
tor, said returning to helping
patients is the clinic's top pri-
ority.
"Probably the most excit-
ing and important thing for me
and for students is really get-
ting back to providing service
for the patients," Conjeevaram
said. "That's the goal always
and that's the most important
thing. A lot of patients have
chronic diseases ... so we've
been talking to patients, trying
to make sure they aren't out of
medications."
He added that the experi-
ence the Free Clinic provides
for aspiring medical students
is beneficial in their learning
process.
"And for the faculty, for us
to be able to provide that to
our students is also really quite
exciting," Conjeevaram said.
The Goldmans and their
team have high hopes for the
clinic and are confident in its
future success in patient care.

Restore democracy
Dingell's bill to prohibit corporate campaign financing deserves support
n April 3, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) spearheaded apanel
on campaign finance issues prevalent since the 2010 U.S.
Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Elec-
tions Commission. The court's decision allowed for unlimited and
sometimes anonymous contributions to political action committees
as long as they are unaffiliated with the campaign, thereby overturn-
ing a large portion of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.
Dingell has introduced new legislation, known as The Restore Con-
fidence in Our Democracy Act, to restore some campaign finance
restrictions. Specifically, it will prohibit corporate spending in elec-
tions while subjecting political action committees to $5,000 contri-
bution limits. Though this legislation won't likely pass the House of
Representatives, it's extremely important that a member of Congress
is recognizing the immense challenges of campaign finance.

The man in the cowboy hat - he saved
Jeff's life. There's a video where he goes
right to Jeff, picks him right up and puts
him on the wheelchair and starts putting
the tourniquet on him and pushing him
out. I got to talk to this guy!"
- Jeff Bauman said after he discovered a video of a man rushing his son to medical
attention after the tragic bombings in Boston on Monday, as reported in The New York Times.



Strength in adversity

Bills like Dingell's warrant more support.
In the 2012 election cycle, the country saw an
unprecedented $6 billion spent on elections,
with each presidential candidate pulling in
nearly $1 billion. Probably the most infamous
individual donor was casino tycoon Sheldon
Adelson, who pledged nearly $100 million of
his own money to various Republicans, includ-
ing Mitt Romney. This kind of disenfranchise-
ment of the individual voter can't be tolerated.
Even more frightening is the fact that some
$400 million in "dark money"- money con-
tributed anonymously - was spent through-
out the campaign cycle. This comes out to be
37 percent of all independent expenditures.
Major federal election reform is needed to
stop this type of influence in politics, especial-
ly influence that's seemingly untraceable. The
Citizens United decision allowed non-profit
corporations to keep vast amounts of money
completely unreported, and the current trend
is more and more money appearing as anony-
mous. Dingell's legislation would force dis-
closure and transparency in elections while

limiting the total money one person or orga-
nization could donate, bringing back at least
some dignity to our election process.
When questioned about the possibility of
a constitutional amendment to overturn the
entirety of the Citizens United decision, Ding-
ell explained that this was the best Congress
could hope for at this time, saying "the perfect
cannot be the enemy of the good." Though a
constitutional change is unlikely, the conver-
sation can't stop. In order to end the influence
of money in politics, the United States must
amend the Constitution and end corporate
personhood. The rights of "corporations as
people" has legally allowed for big businesses
and extremely wealthy individuals to expand
their reach far into government. This legal
entitlement must be taken away, as it's tanta-
mount to the power over decision making that
corporations hold.
If we want to truly restore confidence in
our democracy, we must fully work to undue
the effect of Citizen's United through mean-
ingful legislation.

Tragedy struck Boston and
the entire nation Monday
when two bombs were
detonated at
the finish line
of the Boston
Marathon, kill-
ing three and
injuringmore
than 140 indi-
viduals. Little
information has
been released TIMOTHY
by authorities BURROUGHS
about pos-
sible suspects as
investigators continue to examine
the crime scene. Fox News reported
that a senior official from the White
House referred to the attack as "an
act of terrorism," though President
Barack Obama avoided the phrase
in his statement at 6 p.m Monday.
Due to the seeming coordination
of the two bombs and a third in the
JFK Library, experts are speculat-
ing that they're connected. Another
later explosion at a local library may
or may not be linked.
The sights and sounds appear-
ing on social media sites following
the blasts seem more fitting in a
warzone than the end of a historic
marathon. Videos of the explosion
show blood-covered sidewalks, as
well as people holding their injuries
and fleeing the scene. The medical
tent for runners near the finish line
transformed from an aid station for
marathon runners to an impromptu
field hospital.
I stumbled across the news story
on Twitter during my afternoon
classes as the first reports were
coming out of Boston. Like many
others, I was horrified and stunned,
unable to comprehend how this
ruthless act could happen at an

event that, for many runners, marks
a lifelong achievement. Further-
more, this attack targeted families
and civilians who were exercising
their right to celebrate the achieve-
ments of others. I was devastated
watching hundreds of people cry-
ing and searching for loved ones as
emergency personnel rushed the
wounded to nearby hospitals. How-
ever, after a few hours of watching
videos and reading reports from
local journalists, I was hit with a
very different emotion: pride.
Immediately following the explo-
sions, first responders, many wear-
ing neon yellow jackets, could be
seen running directly to the scene
to assist the injured. Their courage
and quick action saved lives as more
than 140 people were rushed to local
hospitals for treatment. They were
seen carrying wounded civilians to
a nearby medical tent seconds after
the blast occurred. Police, fire and
rescue workers immediately evacu-
ated runners and spectators from
the finish line area and established
a perimeter to preserve the crime
scene. Authorities used television,
radio and Internet to warnthe public
of other possible bombs. They urged
locals to return to their homes and
visitors to stay in their hotel rooms.
The bravery and quick responses
of these individuals saved lives and
avoided a city-wide panic. Addition-
ally, it was reported that doctors
who had just completed the mara-
thon jumped into action to treat the
wounded near the finish line.
We can never sufficiently praise
the work and courage of our first
responders. These acts of heroism by
everyday citizens show the strength
and courage of the American people.
Many rushed to donate blood to vic-
tims of the attack. Organizations

and individuals have already pub-
lically pledged support and aid to
families and the Boston community.
The War on Terror is
far from over and
our opponents
are cowards.
Though it's still unclear who is
responsible for Monday's attacks,
the Boston Marathon bombings
have confirmed two things: The
war on terror is far from over and
our opponents are not freedom
fighters, but cowards. They are
cowards who attack civilians with
hidden bombs on public sidewalks
to try to prove America isn't invin-
cible. They employ fear to disrupt
our daily lives and shake us from
our morals and beliefs, but America
will overcome this.
Though we may never be com-
pletely safe when attending a game
at the Big House or using pub-
lic transportation, the American
people won't falter in the face of
these senseless killings. We won't
let these acts of terror disrupt our
lives and let these individuals win.
Instead, we will unite and support
the Boston community and re-
dedicate ourselves to fighting this
evil in' our world. The worst and
the best of humanity was on display
Monday, and I have no doubt that
the will of the American people will
be victorious.

The exceptions prove the rule

4

As I write this, I'm still transfixed by cov-
erage of the horrific bombing in my home-
town of Boston. The only word I can think of
to describe it is heartbreaking. High profile,
yes - the Boston Marathon is one of the most
well known of its kind, attracting runners
from some 96 different countries this year.
lut much more importantly, the Boston Mar-
athon is inclusive.
It's as much about the spectators as it is about
the runners: Families and friends from all over
the city, state, country and world arrive with
homemade signs, cheering on their runners,
then sticking around to cheer on all the other
runners. They hand out water, Gatorade, Mylar
blankets and anything else they think will help.
Everyone smiles at everyone else on Marathon
Monday, because we all know this is why we're
here: to have fun with strangers. Withering
Boston sarcasm - a local delicacy - is sup-
planted by an almost surreal level of goodwill
toward visitors and natives alike.
Our yearly athletic bacchanalia, a veritable
celebration of visitors in a city not always
known for its approachable strangers - this
is the rule. The exception is what happened
on Monday, April 15. It's important to remem-
ber just how exceptional it was, too. As the
oldest yearly marathon in the world, the Bos-
ton Marathon dates back to 1897 and has been
a remarkably peaceful celebration since.
The exception is a cowardly act: taking
lives away from the innocent and legs away
from those who valued them most. The rule
is brave, inspiring individuals who run whole
marathons not because they're natural ath-
letes, but because they're raising money for
charity in memory of a loved one.
The exception is little kids scared because
their parents are scared, the uncertainty in

those terrifying first few minutes almost -
but not quite - inducing panic on Boylston
Street. The rule is hundreds of heroic first
responders, trained and otherwise, who ran
toward the scene of the bombing instead of
away, making tourniquets out of lanyards and
saving countless lives.
The exception is streets choked with
ambulances and emergency room doctors
pulling ball bearings out of ruined limbs. The
rule is streets full of local Bostonians, offer-
ing cell phones, water, jackets, rooms for the
night, Internet access or just hugs. The rule
is doubling down on the spirit of the Boston
Marathon, to make sure locals and out-of-
towners are taken care of.
The exception, lest anyone forget, is anger,
hatred, accusation and speculation about who
might have done such a thing. The excep-
tion is lashing out without knowledge, out of
anger and fear. The rule is justice: Patience as
law enforcement is allowed to methodically
investigate, and compassion as citizens and
visitors comfort one another.
Some will say that the Boston Marathon
has lost its innocence, that the heightened
security will undermine the spirit of com-
munity that has become the hallmark of
Marathon Monday. But this was never about
innocence - let's face it, innocence has never
been a good look for Boston. It's abort a small
community that decided 117 years ago to pick
one of the first warm days of the year to open
its arms to visitors from around the globe.
Extra security won't change that, just like
a cowardly attack won't change it - these
things are the exceptions, and sometimes the
exceptions prove the rule.

Engaging education

Last Friday, the University hosted
the K-Grams Kids Fair at the Cliff
Keen Arena and Intramural Sports
Building. Hundreds of elementary
school kids crowded the buildings
to meet their University-student pen
pals and share educational activi-
ties. When I entered to find Robert,
the Ypsilanti fourth grader I have
been writingto all year, I was imme-
diately swarmed by a group of his
classmates, asking me if I knew Jill
or Gina or Emily and if they were
coming today. The kids were over-
joyed to meet their pen pals and
excited to be in a new space, asking
questions and spewing information
to me about the activities they had
participated in earlier.
After talking to Robert for half
an hour, I found out that this was
the only field trip he and his class
were taking all year - less than
15 minutes away from his school.
I asked him why they didn't take
more trips. He said, "Do you know
how expensive it is to take field
trips? It's $600!"
I felt a sudden shock of reality.
Why did a fourth grader know how
expensive it was to take a field trip?
And why is learning outside of the
classroom such a privilege? At the
developmental stage of an elemen-
tary school child, it's important to
be motivated throughout the learn-
ing process, and field trips are a
great outlet. K-Grams is an amaz-

ing opportunity and one of the
most meaningful things that will
happen to these kids all year. But it
shouldn't be that way. It's important
for kids to have frequent exposure
to learning outside the classroom in
order to develop healthy life skills.
Money shouldn't be hampering
educational field trips. According
to an article by U.S. Newswire, "To
meet the higher academic stan-
dards set for them, children must
have access to avarietyof enriching
activities so that learning extends
beyond the classroom walls and
the traditional school day." The
article goes on to say, "Governors,
states and communities must work
together to weave a seamless web of
learning opportunities for children.
Doing so will ensure that children
can grow into adults who have a
better chance to succeed."
On Monday, April 15 Michi-
gan Gov. Rick Snyder announced
the opposite. He said as a result of
federal budget cuts there will be
losses in allowances for low-income
children as well as a $54-million
cut in the funding of after-school
programs, special education, and
career and technical education
programs..This is a great example
of what we shouldn't be doing in
Michigan public schools. Instead
of cutting funding that can help our
public schools foster learning out-
side of the classroom and getting

kids interested in future careers,
we should be putting money into
education that helps youths feel
connected and interested. When
kids drop out of high school several
years down the road because they
feel disconnected and unimport-
ant, it only perpetuates the current
trends of crime, poverty and lack of
productivity.
Privileged families can afford to
send their kids to private schools,
many of which focus on learning
outside of the classroom and devel-
oping the whole person, while fam-
ilies who are barely making ends
meet- are at the mercy of Snyder
when he decides to cut after school
programs. It's important to get our
kids engaged in learning outside
of the classroom at a young age.
Developmentally speaking, it can
only help them in the future.
Using money as an excuse to not
allow our public school children to
explore the outside world is ridicu-
lous. We should be allocating our
federal money differently. Early edu-
cation is the key to a lot of our soci-
etal problems. We should be doing
more than mitigating these social
problems, such as crime and poverty.
We have the power to take a proac-
tive stance to stopping these societal
issues through getting kids involved
in learning at an early age.

Takics Quartet attracts
an orchestral newcomer

Warmer
weather means
healthier habits

Learning to love
conductorless
classical music
By CARLINA DUAN
Daily Community Culture Editor
Let me be clear: I don't play the
violin. But I flirted with the idea
ofbecoming a music conductor for
about a week in the sixth grade,
when the boy I had a crush on
strutted to the front of our orches-
tra class, slipped off his shoes and
began whisking around a pen-
cil, conducting our class to the
"Pirates of the Caribbean" theme
song. Sockless. I thought he was
hot stuff.
I don't play the violin, but
occasionally, I fall in love with
orchestral music, and mostly
with conductors. I love the way
that everything comes together
beneath one tip of the baton - the
cellos, with their booming grand-
daddy voices; the violins, with
their smirking, high-pitched glee.
The violas, who are often over-
looked but are still appreciated
wholesomely -theirstrings hum-
ming out a buttery tenor. In the
moment right before an orchestra
begins playing, I always suck in a
sharp breath of air, never released
until that first flip of the conduc-
tor's hand. Conductors make me
feel safe. I watch their fingers
prancing around during orches-
tra concerts, and I feel as if I have
direction, as if I know where I'm
going in this concert, with my
back flopped against the seat and

mybreathless lungs huffing.
That's why, when my friend
Heather invited me to the Takacs
Quartet concert in Rackham
Auditorium on April 12, I was
pretty hyped. Music! Classical
music! I could be classy! Prob-
ably there would be very classily
dressed men there! Probably the
classiest person would be the con-
ductor! Yeah!
Here bounces in my ignorance.
After four years of playing the vio-
lin, I dropped the lessons as soon
as I hit high school. My orchestra
experiences consisted of: A) Mim-
icking a shaky vibrato by flapping
my wrist around the fastest as I
could and B) doodling bouquets
of flowers all over my sheet music,
so by the time we performed our
annual Spring Concert, I couldn't
read the notes beneath a layer of
graphite blossoms andI paused in
the middle of the concert, sneakily
reaching for an eraser. Needless to
say, orchestra was not a good time
in my life.
So, how was I supposed to
know that in a quartet, there's no
conductor?! No classy black suit-
clad man or woman to watch. I'd
have to watch the instruments,
which was, OK, fine, but past
experiences at middle-school
orchestra concerts had told me
that there wasn't going to be
much to watch. Justbows streak-
ing across a few strings.
I hid my disappointment by
reading the program. The Takacs
Quartet, formed in 1975 in Buda-
pest by four founding members
- only one of whom still remains,
Kdroly Schranz, on the violin.

The remaining three members,
Edward Dusinberre on the vio-
lin, Geraldine Walther on the
viola and Andras Fejer on the
cello, now currently comprise
the group, which has won a num-
ber of prestigious awards since
its creation, including the order
of Merit Commander's Cross by
the president of the Republic of
Hungary.
On Friday, the quartet met the
Rackham stage with the grace of
those familiar to a lit-up stage.
They bowed, slowly, then sat
down on simple, cream-colored
seats. In the audience, muffled
coughs blurted. Then, silence.
No conductor, yet the quartet
members all began at the same
time, with a fluidness to their
bodies and their bows, as if being
pulled together by the same wire.
The notes rippled from their
instruments in haunting, spi-
raling tones. Midway through
the, first piece (Franz Joseph
Hayden's No. 63 in B-fiat Major,
Op. 76, No. 4), I marveled at the
quartet's motion. They weren't
rising off their seats, but they
weren't still, either. There seemed
to be a kind of secret dance alive
in their elbows, their hands, their
backs: A dance that manifested
itself in quick flicks of the wrist; a
whirring of the torso; a resonant,
almost holy-looking reverence on
the face.
There was art in their body-
work as much as there existed
art in each musical note, a kind
of art that inhabits the imagina-
tive space. Every time the music
would leap forward in a swell of

crescendo and rumbling notes,
the quartet would also seem to
puff up in huge and loud move-
ments. Their actions mimicked
in the music. I wasn't craving a
conductor anymore. These guys
were it. Watching them was
almost more fascinating than my
previous obsession with watch-
ing a conductor's direction.
As the concert pulsed through
the night, Britten's String Quar-
tet No. 3, Op. 94 reminded me,
at times, of salt shakers spread-
ing over vegetables; and at other
times, of the hum and lull of
water waves. The last piece,
Beethoven's String Quartet in
C-sharp minor, Op. 131, tapped
my feet hard on the concert
floors and made my legs swoon.
The quartet's synchrony and
vibrant motion allowed me to
recognize classical music's abil-
ity to reveal the imaginative. As
an audience member who rarely
listens to Beethoven or Hayden,
let alone understands all the
complicated factors that make
up a "good" performance, I left
the show in awe.
In the eighth grade, my last
year of playing in an orchestra,
I often dreaded performances
because I didn't think we were
playing anything "important,"
and that our orchestra teacher,
the conductor, had a bigger role
to play. Looking back, those
performances were incredibly
important opportunities to cre-
ate art - through connection
with music in bodily, imagina-
tively and emotionally charged
ways - on the stage.

the vacillat-

I turned on my car and the
thermometer read 70 degrees,
I knew better than to gather
all of my boots - strewn across
the floor from frequent use
- and pluck my heavy jackets
from their easy-access wall
hooks and nestle them deep in
the closet for a long summer's
nap - it's still too soon.
As I write my final column
of the semester, in my usual
study spot at the counter of
Biggby Coffee on E. Liberty, I
have a panoramic view of the
unrelenting cascades of sleet
currently attacking the streets
of Ann Arbor. There's no better

ping a trip to the gym because I
decide that the treadmill is too
monotonous, and the elliptical
isn't entertaining enough and
who wants to ride a bike that
doesn't go anywhere?
And then, if I need extra con-

are better spent catching up on
"Homeland" (If you've seen this
show, then you understand my
dilemma), the "germ excuse"
kicks in, and all of a sudden I'm
certain that I'll catch the flu
that's going around if I use pub-

Excuses live, breathe and
wreak havoc everywhere, but
they're especially strong and
active in my mind during a
Michigan winter. For me, the
inclement weather, a somewhat
legitimate obstacle to being
active, sparks this chain reac-
tion of ridiculous reasons not to
exercise. But seeing as I'm stuck
in this state for at least one
more year - moving to Texas
or Southern California is still a
few pages ahead in my playbook
- all I can do is wait for that
exhilarating moment when my
winter garb does finally go away
for the season.
And when that happens,
folks, there are no more excus-

the tech giant installed city-

For a re-release, "Soul Hack-
ers" does a pretty solid job tak-
ing advantage of the current
hardware. Environments are
carefully layered and the bot-
tom screen displays the local
map, with the option to turn on
additional hacks to make the
game easier. The pseudo-3-D of
the 3DS merges seamlessly with
the virtual-reality aspect of the
game, with half of the action
taking place within Paradigm

X. The sound design leaves little
to be desired, with much of the
character dialogue being voiced
for the first time and a badass
high-octane soundtrack pump-
ing throughout.
The updated graphics don't
do an exceptional job of keeping
the game competitive with its
peers, and lazily differentiated
textures make every environ-
ment feel more or less the same.
The game's strict first-person
camera and limited mobility
instills a sense of claustropho-
bia at some points, but regular
battles and interactions keep
monotony from setting in.
Providing gameplay that's
radically divergent from the
norm, "Soul Hackers" delivers
a genuinely entertaining expe-
rience in a heavily fleshed-out
and detailed world. While the
environments aren't excep-
tionally distinct, the depth of
combat and demon summon-
ing will keep players enthralled
throughout.

'Crazy For You'

McFerrin to bring latest

Lighthearted
production to blend
plot and dance
By REBECCA GODWIN
Daily Arts Writer
Choices play an important part
in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance's upcom-
ing production
of "Crazy for Cmy for
You," directed YOU
by Associate
Professor of Thursday at
Musical The- 7:30 p.m.,
atre Linda Friday and
Goodrich and Saturday at 8
opening on p.m., and Sun-
April18. day at 2 p.m.
"Ultimate-
ly, you have Power Center
a choice, in From $20
life," Goodrich
said. "You can
choose the positive and choose to
love and choose to dance, or you
can choose to complain and be
loveless."
This is the choice that main
character Bobby Child, a rich
playboy, must make when his
mother sends him to Deadrock,
Nev., to foreclose on the local the-

ater. But when he inadvertently
falls in love with the theater own-
er's daughter, Polly Baker, he's
forced to decide between the path
his family wants him to take and
the path his heart is telling him to
take.
"It's a little bit of aboy-meets-
girl show, but there are so many
twists and turns," Goodrich
explained. "So it's more he meets
her, he gets her, he loses her, he
gets her again in a disguise, he
loses her in the disguise, he finds
himself and then he gets her as
himself."
The musical, written by
George and Ira Gershwin, and
Ken Ludwig, has an incredibly
strong dance element. Originally
choreographed by Tony award-
winner Susan Stroman, Goodrich
wanted to keep as much of that
original choreography intact.
"We chose this show with the
intent of having the Stroman
choreography recreated so our
students would get the chance
to work in that vein," Goodrich
said. "There are two pieces that
another faculty member, Ron
DeJesus, choreographed ... then
all the tap choreography is Susan
Stroman's."
While Goodrich wasn't ini-
tially supposed to direct the

show, she has enjoyed the oppor-
tunity to work more with the
students.
"I think working with the stu-
dents and seeing them discover
the show for the first time and
seeing what they've been able to
accomplish has been my favor-
ite part," she said. "Comedy is
much harder than tragedy and
seeing them being able to find a
style and accomplish that and to
learn these very detailed dances
is really interesting."
As a professor, though, she
can't always prevent herself
from using the rehearsals as an
opportunity to teach.
"It's somewhat of a different
animal, but if there are points or
rehearsal etiquette or process-
ing things that I see are not hap-
pening, then I step into the role
of teacher a little bit," Goodrich
said.
According to Goodrich,
there's something for everyone
in the show, so even those who
don't like musicals will be able to
enjoy themselves.
"The book is very well writ-
ten, and the storytelling is
through dance," Goodrich
explained. "And I think it's a
universal story so everyone
relates to these characters."

to present his latest project,

atic baritone Hill

performer of
these tradition-
al songs. McFerrin has made a
full exploration of his roots, and
his performance on this tour will
be freshly self-aware.
African American spiritu-
als are folk songs that form the
foundation of African Ameri-
can music. They form a highly
improvisatory, oral tradition
that's largely responsible for the
formation of countless genres,
including jazz and hip hop. Rob-
ert McFerrin Sr.'s commitment to
spirituals has been a formative
influence for son Bobby McFer-
rin throughout his career, and it
shows in his performance style.
Since spirituals were passed
along without notation and
without accompaniment, impro-
visation is a given.
"I'm sure Robert McFerris,
in his spirituals - and he sang
a lot of spirituals - really knew
how to improvise," said Profes-
sor Emeritus of Voice Willis
Patterson, a personal friend of
McFerrin Sr. and former presi-
dent of the National Association
of Negro Musicians. "So I'm sure
that ability, or that tendency,
to improvise is something that
Bobby took off of. Improvisation
is the name of his game."
McFerrin's vocal technique
can also be partly attributed to
his father's influence.
"Both his parents were active
singers ... He came about singing
the way a lot of kids come about
walking," Patterson said. "(His)
vocal ability is something I
think is a natural product of the

Bakich doesn't want that differ-
ence to go unnoticed.
"Once you start feeling good
about yourself, about where you
are, three to four weeks into Big
Ten play, that's when you get bit
in the butt," Bakich said. "We're
playing well right now, but we're
not playing our best."
The win marked Michigan's
13th straight game that the
pitching staff has allowed three
or fewer runs. The Wolverines
have recorded two shutouts over
the course of their 10-game win
streak, and they're tied for first
place in the Big Ten.
If this isn't their best, Michi-
gan baseball fans have a lot to
look forward to.

The Michigan baseball and softball teams have
combined for 28 consecutive victories. Here's a
closer look at the success on the diamond:
- Outscoring opponents 54-13
Team's longest winning streak since 2008 (16 games)
-First consecutive Big Ten sweeps since 2008
-Tied with Minnesota for first place in the Big Ten
-Outscoring opponents 176-49
13-0 in Big Ten play during streak
-Longest conference winning streak in the nation
- Averaging 7.62 runs per game, second in the nation

As decisions loom, a
season's celebration

Senior Evan King decided not to turn professional out of high school, on the advice of former Wolverine MaliVai Washington.
Pros in sight for King
atr four-year wait

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Sophomore point guard Trey
Burke and five seniors are offi-
cially gone. There could be as
many as three other departures
from the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team over the next two
weeks, depending on if junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. and
freshmen forwards Glenn Rob-
inson III and Mitch McGary
decide to forego eligibility and
enter the NBA Draft. The Michi-
gan basketball team could go
from a Top-25 preseason pick to
an unknown fate depending on
what the three decide.
But on Tuesday, at the end-
of-the-season banquet, it was all
smiles for Michigan.
For the second straight year,
Burke won the team MVP award,
becoming the 23rd Wolverine to
earn multiple team MVP awards.
The only surprise award from
the night was the Rudy Tomja-
novich Most Improved Player
Award,which went to Hardaway.
He was the team's second-lead-
ing scorer last year as well as this
year, but improved on his 3-point
percentage by more than nine
percentage points in addition to
slightly improving this field-goal
percentage.

Four of the Michigan basketball team's freshmen show off their hardware.

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Last April, senior Evan King
hit a booming serve wide against
then-fourth-ranked Dennis Nevolo
of Illinois. After a big backhand
return, followed by a nine-stroke
rally, King watched as Nevolo's
desperation lob bounced just
beyond the baseline.
He'd done it;he'd just beat Nevo-
lo. This was instrumental, as King
had neither defeated Illinois, nor
Nevolo. Secondsalater, King's whole
team surrounded him, jumping
with joy. There are moments in
every athlete's life that justify all
the sacrifices he or she makes - for
King,this was it.
Now, it's King's turn to hit the
professional circuit. As soon as his
Michigan career ends, King will
immediately start his pro career.
Growing up, King was widely
regarded as one of the future stars
of American tennis. King was
always a favorite in junior grand-
slam tournaments. Just as often,
he won.
For Ran, though, the choice
was clear.
At age 17 or 18, junior tennis
players, especially those with
King's pedigree, are faced with a
tough decision - collegiate tennis
vs. professional tennis. And often
times, the promise of tournament
titles and prize money trumps
years of toiling in the trenches.
This was a surprisingly simple
decision for King. Although lots of
King's childhood friends, whom
he met through tennis, were going
pro, King knew he had to attend
college.
"It was a simple decision," King
said. "I was never turning pro right
out of high school. My parents
always stressed a college educa-
tion, so it wasn't on the table, even
if had the ability to do so."
King's parents, Van and Evelyn,
knew that college was a no-brainer
and would be instrumental in his
tennis career, despite riskinga slow
start on the professional circuit. A
Michigan education was too great
of an opportunity.
"I went to Michigan," Van said.
"Iknow when I came out and start-
"ed working, I had seen the best of
the best, and was prepared. And
.I knew it would be the same with
Evan."
King also received advice
from former Wolverine MaliVai
'Mal" Washington, whom King
* has known since he was 10. For-
merly a finalist at Wimbledon and
11th-ranked player in the world,
-Washington shared his experi-
ences at Michigan with King. Mal,
:too, turned down the professional
-circuit at age 18 in order to attend
Michigan.
He told King that this would be
the smartest and best decision he
ever made. Washington has held
his own against the likes of Grand
Slam champions Pete Sampras,
Andre Agassi and Jim Courier.
King knew if aplayer of this caliber
could be successful after attending
college, so could he.

The scene inside the Crisler
Center for the banquet reflect-
ed the good vibes surround-
ing a team that had reached the
National Championship game
for the first time since 1993.
Before the ceremony, an auto-
graph line stretched for more
than half of the concourse. Six
years ago, when Michigan coach
John Beilein first took over the
program, the autograph line
wouldn't have lasted more than
five minutes.
"The first banquet, we had
about five tables," Beilein said.
"It's come a long way, and it's
come from a lot of great people."
The positive feelings have
been going all week. Last week,

Beilein and Burke flew to Los
Angeles, where Burke accepted
the John R. Wooden award-given
to the nation's top player. In
Los Angeles, they were stopped
"many, many times" according
to Beilein. Everyone wanted a
picture orto congratulate Burke
on a year that saw him win every
major individual award.
Six years ago, Beilein and the
program didn't have a player
anywhere near Burke's caliber.
Six years ago, the entire floor of
the Crisler Center wouldn't have
been sold out for a banquet. Six
years ago, the patrons inside
Crisler wouldn't have given
Beilein a standing ovation or
treated him like a celebrity.
There was a man standing by
the entrance to the floor, and
when Beilein walked by, he said,
"Thank you coach. Thank you,
forever!"
With or without Burke, it's a
different era for: the Michigan
basketball program.
NOTE: Beilein said that
because of travel, he hasn't had a
chance to sit down with McGary,
Robinson or Hardaway to talk
about their NBA decisions, but
he did have each assistant coach
sit down with the players. The
trio has until April 28 to make
their decisions.

giving these girls ...
a Michigan degree,
S obut a chance at a
better life, that's
reallyrewarding."
While many college students barely
have time to heat up a bowl of ramen noo-
dles, LSA senior Meaghan O'Connor has
baked over 1,000 cupcakes this year. But
the Grand Rapids, Mich. native isn't trying
to fill an insatiable sweet tooth - she's hop-
ing to inspire students around campus.
It was through a marketing internship
with Food Network Magazine in New
York this past summer that O'Connor met
the national organizer of She's the First,
a national non-profit organization that
raises money to send girls to school. When
she came'back to Ann Arbor in the fall,
O'Connor founded the University's chap-
ter of the club. This is where the cupcakes
come in: The club has periodic bake sales
with all ofthe money raised fromselling its
signature tie-dyed cupcakes going to sup-
port the education of underprivileged girls
in Guatemala.
"I was inspired to start this non-profit
because I feel really blessed to have this
educational experience," O'Connor said.
So far,the club has raised enough money
to send two girls to school, an impres-
sive feat for a fledgling organization. And
national organizers have noticed. Earlier
this month, she and LSA junior Elizabeth
Rich, another member of the student orga-
nization, went to the Clinton Global Initia-
tive University conference, where they met

with Chelsea Clinton and other student
leaders to discuss global issues.
Besides baking, O'Connor also men-
tors local high school students as part of
Young Life, a non-denominational Chris-
tian ministry she herself was a part of
in high school. She meets with about 20
students once a week to read the Bible,
discuss life and give advice. As the oldest
of four, she said she is drawn to helping
younger people.
"I think with growing up with younger
siblings I've always had a knack for caring
for younger people," she said.
Currently, she has internships with Cur-
rent Magazine in Ann Arbor and Neebo,
the textbook company. She's also a member
of Alpha Chi Omega sorority and she was
editor-in-chief of The Forum Greek News-
paper for two years.
O'Connor will graduate a year early this
May. Though she has no concrete plans
yet, she said she will go back to New York,
where all of her internship and job experi-
ence will hopefully land her in a marketing
position at a magazine.
"I really feel ready to be at the next step
in my life," she said. "It terrifies me, but I'm
also ready for it at the same time."
Though she used to be shy in high
school, she said coming to college broke
her out of her shell. Through her intern-
ship experiences - as well as many trials
and errors - she said she's transformed
from a soft-spoken leader to an outspoken
go-getter. If her time at the University has
taught her anything, it's to branch out and
make connections with people.

enny Ryan is a lot of things.
She's an LSA senior, she's a
point guard, she was the cap-
tain of this year's women'sbas-
ketball squad and she's a third
team All-Big Ten selection.
But above all else, Jenny Ryan is a
Wolverine.
The Saginaw native will go down as one
of the best women's basketball players in
program history, both on and off the court.
"As a freshman, I just tried to learn my
place," Ryan said. "(But) by senior year, I
just wanted to leave my mark."
Averaging 10.2 points per game, while
adding 4.2 rebounds and 5.1 assists, Ryan
was not only a leader in the locker room,
but also on the court. Kim Barnes Arico,
Michigan's first-year head coach, consis-
tently pointed to Ryan as the most invalu-
able part of the team's success.
"I've coached a lot of really good point
guards in my career as a coach, and she
leads the pack just because of everything
she does," Barnes Arico said after a huge
win against Michigan State in February.
"She's the total package. She's a coach's
dream really."
Added Ryan: "With a coaching change
you don't know what to expect, but Coach
Arico made our senior year as special as it
could be. She gave me a lot of freedom and
a lot of responsibility. She trust me a lot
and by naming me captain, it kind of made
it that much more special."
During the rare moments Ryan spent
on the bench, she strived to pump up her
teammates, keeping everyone focused and
motivated. Even in the locker room, Ryan
was at the center ofit all, pushing everyone
to get better.

One of the highlights of Ryan's senior
season was in a season-defining win over
Michigan State on Feb.16, where the Wol-
verines ended a six-year drought against
their in-state rivals. During that game,
Ryan scored a career-high 24 points while
committing zero turnovers.
But as the curtains close, and Ryan
looks back on her last four years, she can't
believe its over.
"Just being apart of the University of
Michigan and being able to support the
'Block M'is something that you try to put to
words, but you can't," Ryan said. "You just
look down at your jersey and see what you
were given. It was an awesome experience
the whole time. I can't believe its over."
Ryan, however, isn't ready to leave
just yet.
"A big part of me wants to stay in Ann
Arbor," Ryan said. "I love this place and
I don't want to leave anytime soon. If I
stay in basketball it will be in a coach-
ing position."
Seeing Ryan as a coach doesn't seem too
far off. Both she and senior center Rachel
Sheffer were chosen for the "So You Want
to be a Coach" program, a workshop held
in conjunction with the Women's Basket-
ball Coaches Association National Con-
vention in New Orleans from April 5-7.
But before Ryan makes the jump to her
next endeavor, she can't help but look back
one last time.
"I know in my senior year I became a
better basketball player, and I became a
better person," Ryan said. "I just think
that every time you do your last thing as
a senior it becomes that morespecial. It's
something you can look back on and lay
your hat on."

2B Wednesday, April17, 2013 // The Statement

Wednesday. April 17, 2013 // The Statement

letter from the editor by haley goldberg
There are about 40,000 undergraduate and
graduate students enrolled atfthe University this
semester, according to the University's Office
of the Registrar. That's 40,000 students with
leadership roles, academic excellence, athletic
achievements and more. When our staff sat down
last month to pick 11 students to highlight as the
"Students of the Year" - it wasn't easy. So we
sent out a survey to hear from you. We wanted
to know: Who are the people you see excelling in
student groups and on the stage? On the first day
of a new semester - when you play the awkward
dance of learning about each other - who are the
people that take you aback with their work on this
campus and in the greater world?
Even with the power of Google forms on our side,
we couldn't reach all students for nominations.
But the managing editors for each section of
the paper sat down to discuss the more than 50
nominations we did receive. In these eight pages,
you can read the stories of the 11 nominees we
felt embodied a "Student of the Year." They're
students working to aid communities near and far,
advocating for justice on campus, representing the
University proudly on the field, on the court and
overall making this campus a better place. These
11 individuals are making a difference, but that's
not to say you aren't too. Use these stories as
inspiration and decide what positive mark you will
make at our University.

Astudent's first year
at the University
can be overwhelm-
ing, but as a pas-
sionate performer,
student, artist and advocate for
social justice, freshman Brian
Garcia is already beginning to
make a difference.
Garcia is a School of Art &
Design and School of Music, The-
atre & Dance student majoring
in Interarts Performance, with a
focus on LGBT studies, women's
studies and feminist theory.
Garcia said his involvement
in several campus organizations
- including Assisting Latinos to
Maximize Achievement, Coali-
tion for Queer People of Color, the
.Educational Theater Company and
Detroit Connections - contrib-
ute to his drive to improve life and
opportunities for people struggling
to take pride in their identities.
The Interarts Performance
major, introduced in fall 2009, is a
competitive major that allows stu-
dents to create their own unique
brand of art. It's the brainchild
of Music, Theatre & Dance Asso-
ciate Prof. Holly Hughes, whose
campy murder-mystery produc-
tion, "The Well of Horniness,"
will feature Brian as Vicki - a
character who escapes from an
evil lesbian sorority by hooking-
up with a man - when it opens in
New York City later this year.

At the Interarts Showcase last
fall 2012, Garcia created an audio-
visual-live-performance on race
and ethnicity. During his spare
time, Garcia paints with oil pas-
tels, sketches, draws and paints
and does "pretty much anything
except singing."
With Detroit Connections - a
volunteer program through the
School of Art & Design - Garcia
traveled to the city every Friday
to teach students in a Detroit
classroom. And working with
the Coalition for Queer People
of Color, he emceed a catwalk
extravaganza last week for the
two-day Color of Change summit.
"My main goal is to educate,"
Garcia said. "I want to use art as
a motivational tool for education."
Throughout Garcia's freshman
year, he was mentored as part of
ALMA, and hopes to give back
by becoming a mentor himself
this summer - which he said will
allow him to provide students the
resources they need to find orga-
nizations that support LGBT stu-
dents on campus.
"Working in social work and
social justice, there's a point you
hit where you start to think of
teaching people about oppression,
teaching about all the concepts
(and) at a point you start to forget
that time when you were that per-
son," Garcia said. "For example,
I used to be the person who said

'That's so gay,' and I forget that at
one point I didn't know."
Garcia said whatever direction
he takes for a career, it's going to
involve incorporating and repre-
senting people in the Latino and
queer communities, identities
that he said bring unique chal-
lenges.
"For a Latino that's in a con-
servative community, it can be
completely overwhelming to have
not only the misrepresentation of
yourself in queer culture - where
it's mostly white, gay males that
are represented - but you also
have the misrepresentation in
your own culture, the machismo
and the patriarchy that stills go
on," Garcia said.
Garcia said he's always think-
ing about social issues, especially
ones that may at times be over-
looked.
"Well how does this affect the
bigger picture? How am I indi-
rectly, without thinking about it,
affecting the person living out
in the middle of nowhere?" Gar-
cia said. "I think with the 'equal
signs for example,' I think a lot
of people don't realize that the
Human Rights Campaign is large-
ly a white and affluent male com-
munity - that in itself becomes
problematic because people who
are Latino, African-American, if
they don't see themselves in this
group, it becomes problematic." -

"I don't really have a bucket

Well, let's see. How about scor-

he did that already. It was on his

during his freshman year.

Of course he has.

chists," which depicted French kings in
the style of the television series "The
Apprentice."
This was the first of Buoy and Hamel's
many film projects.
As a freshman, Buoy developed an
interest in filmmaking, creating Filmic -
the University's go-to source for promo-
tional and educational videos. After Buoy
asked Hamel to work as the producer,
Filmic launched. When approached by
the 'University administration to create
videos for the University, the team began
with four PSAs for the Office of Student
Affairs.
With the help of their Filmic team,
Buoy and Hamel created iconic Univer-
sity videos like "The Bus Musical" with
Billy Magic, "The Letter 'M' " and "Stay
in the Blue" with Heisman trophy win-
ner Desmond Howard.
"We just really wanted to produce
high quality, student-produced stuff,"
Buoy said. "We are now responsible to
ensure that the student experience is
maintained and preserved."
Filmic serves as only one of their co-
founded organizations. After serving
on the Student Safety Commission for
two years, Buoy and Hamel helped cre-
ate Beyond the Diag - an organization
dedicated to defining and creating a com-
munity for off-campus housing. The duo
defined different neighborhoods for the
program and created community ambas-

sadors to promote safety and connection.
"The trust and opportunities we've
been given as undergraduate students is
really incredible," Hamel said. "We've
been doing things that graduates and
professionals would be doing so we've
really been challenged and pushed.
Michigan puts a lot of faith in us to do
this."
While the longtime friends work col-
laboratively in almost each of their orga-
nizations, Buoy aspires to be a filmmaker
and Hamel plans to continue her studies
in pharmaceutical sciences.
Before attending the University, Buoy
and Hamel did not expect to create -
let alone get involved with - these spe-
cific organizations. As the opportunities
came, the two took full advantage.
"We're here, and we might as well
become very well-versed," Buoy said.
"We constantly think how we can do this
at the level that will earn respect from
peers, administration and the commu-
nity. We never want to half-ass anything.
It's amazing how that's led from oppor-
tunity to opportunity."
While Buoy and Hamel carried their
friendship from middle school to high
school to college, the two said they are
pleased with their legacy left at the Uni-
versity.
"As we're leaving this campus, leaving
a legacy is very important to us," Buoy
said. "We've been given the opportu-
nity to share the story of Michigan that
hasn't been shared before. This campus
is so big, and everything that we've done
makes this place smaller, connected and
more safe."

inec the mioment Trey Burke, an
LSA sophomore, committed to
playing one more season April
2012, the ensuing 12 months
seemed toicomeiout of a fairytale.
There was his sweep of the National Play-
er of the Year awards, the program-record-
tying 31 wins and the NCAA Final Four.
It was easy to forget that on the opening
page of this season, in an exhibition against
Northern Michigan, Burke was sidelined by
a suspension stemming from off-the-court
behavior that remained undisclosed - at
least until felklw teammates, coaches and
Burke himself began talking in the lead up
to the Final Four about how that incident
shaped the sophomore's magical season.
"It was something that definitely allowed
me to grow up from," Burke said.
Burke not only grew into Michigan's
second-ever AP National Player of the Year
winner - the first since 1966 - but into the
team's unquestioned vocal leader. Just a few
months into the season, Beilein named him a
team captain.
"Being that guy's teammate is an honest-
to-God blessing," senior co-captain Josh
Bartelstein said.
On college basketball's biggest stage at
the NCAA National Championship game,
Burke scored the Wolverines' first seven
points en route to his 24-point performance,
but it was a play on the defensive end - a
seemingly-clean block, called for a foul, that
could've sparked a miraculous comeback in
the game's final minutes - that will live on
in infamy.
While, his title-game heroics ultimately
resulted in a loss, fans will never forget his
game-tying 3-pointer in the final moments
of regulation in a win over Kansas the week-
end before.
The shot, which left Burke's hands more
than nine feet behind the 3-point line, was
summed up best by Bartelstein, who called it

"an iconic shot from an iconic player."
Though Michigan fell short of its first title
since 1989, Burke will forever be engrained
in Wolverine basketball history. When the
Wolverines were expected to bea fringe top-
25 team before the start of last season after
Darius Morris decided to forgo his final two
years and depart for the NBA, Burke instead
led Michigan to its first Big Ten Champion-
ship since 1985-86. This season, Burke aver-
aged 18.6 points and 6.7 assists per game
while playing in the one of the country's
strongestconferences in years.
Almost immediately after announcing
his plans to forgo his final two seasons at the
University, talks swirled about retiring his
number by raising the No. 3 to the rafters - a
move endorsed by Beilein.
If the school retires his number, Burke -
who pledged to complete the remainder of
the semester rather than jumping into draft
preparation - hopes that when fans see his
name in the rafters, they'll remember more
than just Burke the athlete.
"Just a guy that left it all out there on the
court, 100-percent effort at all times. A guy
that wanted to represent the University the
right way not only on the court, but off the
court," he said.
On June 27, Burke will almost assuredly
be a lottery draft pick, putting a cap on a sto-
rybook path that wound through Atlanta and
will end with amulti-million dollar contract.
But after calling his life at the moment
"surreal," the All-American shifted his
attention to the cynics - perhaps the same
ones that said he'd never be a high-caliber,
Division I athlete, or win at Michigan, or
have a shot at being drafted.
"A lot of people are doubting me now,"
he said, pausing as he shook his head and
cracked his boyish smile. "Just like they
doubted me coming into Michigan. It's just
goingto make me work harder to become the
best player I can be."

Attracting other lead-
ers is what I've done
the best."
Anxious, restless
and disarmingly mod-
est in manner and speech, Public Policy
senior Kevin Mersol-Barg does not resem-
ble your typical political figure. Whereas
some great orators have relied on theatrics
to get their point across, Mersol-Barg's
speech patterns are completely and utterly
drama-free.
Yet this lack of drama might in some
sense be Mersol-Barg's greatest strength.
"He doesn't need to be at the center in
order to be a leader," said LSA senior Amy
Navvab, who ran alongside Mersol-Barg
in the 2012 Central Student Government
elections. "Kevin really works to bring out
the best in the people around him."
Mersol-Barg's resume boasts an
impressive collection of experiences. To
name a few: College Democrats, Human
Rights Through Education, a columnist
for the Daily and presidential candidate
for Central Student Government. His
greatest achievement, however, is the cre-
ation of the Coalition for Tuition Equality,
a group of affiliated human rights organi-
zations whose mission is to extend in-state
tuition towards undocumented stude ts
in Michigan.
Over the past year, CTE has become
widelyknown across campusfortheincen-
diary nature of its political message. The
organization's efforts to change Univer-'
sity policy for undocumented immigrants
culminated at a breathtakingly emotional
Regents meeting last December.
More than 150 students with red tape
plastered over their mouths huddled
in the Anderson Room of the Michigan

Union, calling attention to the 29,000
undocumented students residing in the
state of Michigan deterred from attend-
ing the University due to the steep price
of tuition.
CTE is a youthful organization. Its offi-
cial birth date, October 2011, roughly cor-
responds to the time Mersol-Barg began
his tenure as an LSA student government
representative.
One of his platforms was "diversity,"
but Mersol-Barg admitted, "I didn't real-
ly know what I was talking about at the
time."
After talking with various students
from minority backgrounds, Mersol-Barg
found tuition equality for undocumented
immigrants to be an important issue.
"It just kind of struck me at a time when
I was looking to do something meaning-
ful," Mersol-Barg said.
Perhaps one of Mersol-Barg's great-
est virtues is his eagerness to collaborate.
CTE's website bears little mention of Mer-
sol-Barg's name, and he modestly credits
the leaders of other progressive organi-
zations like Migrant Immigrants Rights
Advocacy and the American Civil Liber-
ties Union for the success of the coalition.
"Instead of imposing my rule on this
group, I've kind of broughit together a lot
of other brilliant people and found a way
for all of us to work toward this common
cause," Mersol-Bargsaid.
Mersol-Barg expressed a desire to push
against the inertia of the status quo. He
believes in actions rather than speeches,
an attitude not unlike that of the progres-
sive student activists of the 1960s.
"You can go day in, day out, and not
really develop a new approach," he said.
"That kind of static feeling doesn't feel

"cWhat can I do
now, in my
four years
here, that's
going to cre-
ate something impactful?"
Sripriya Navalpakam isn't just an entre-
preneur: She's an activist.
A Business sophomore, Navalpakam
knew she wanted to go to business school
when she was in eighth grade.
She joined the University's MPowered
Entrepreneurship program her freshman
year - to work on social justice issues -
and was given the tools and training to
become an action-based person in the
world of business.
"I've always had this love for microfi-
nance in the developing world," Naval-
pakam said.
She came across Lend for America,
an organization that seeks to empower
upcoming social entrepreneurs to build
business and communities through inno-
vative microfinance.
Navalpakam took what she learned
from her fellowship with that organization
in Rhode Island and brought it back to Ann
Arbor, where she and Business sophomore
Niranjana Kannan started ReSource Fund.
"My passion personally for ReSource
Fund comes from the fact that I go to an
elite business school - where we learn
so much about business and its effect on
communities and things. like that - but
I've always thought: How can I use that
to empower the community members in
my area?" Navalpakam said. "This is the
perfect solution for it: providing financial
resources to a low-income community
member to help them develop a toolkit of
skills to lift them out of poverty."
At the center of Navalpakam's work is
the intersection of business and activism.

To her, social entrepreneurship means the
work she's doing should always'be action-
based.
A large part of ReSource Fund is con-
nectingwith the community. Navalpakam
and Kannan sit down with people in the
Ypsilanti area and talk about what keeps
them up at night, what they want and then
try to design their product around these
needs.
In addition to Navalpakam and Kan-
nan, ReSource Fund is made up of a team
of financial coaches, who are all University
students. The coaches work one-on-one
with clients on issues like banking, debt
management, credit building and other
personal financial services. ReSource
Fund charges a program fee of $120 to
the client, spread across $10 monthly pay-
ments, and then uses that money to facili-
tate a conversation with the credit bureaus
to show that the client is making time
efficient payments to help increase their
credit score.
"So the cool thing about the program is
that not only are we working on financial
issues with the client, but we're also at the
same time increasing their credit score,"
Navalpakam said. "It's a really unique
model."
Her feverish passion to fight preda-
tory lending is what drives Navalpakam's
desire to help low-income families with
their financial problems. She's confi-
dent that ReSource Fund can grow, and
between her classes and other commit-
ments as a University student, she's still
looking for ways to improve the organiza-
tion's services and touch more members of
the community.
"That's what social entrepreneurship
is at its heart: doing something that has
purpose, and at the same time, creating a
sustainable way to go about it."

Wednesday, April 17, 2013 // The Statement m

Elisabeth Hindert, an LSA
senior, swept into the room,
clutching a coffee cup and
armed with an oversized smile.
She had just flown back to Ann
Arbor from New York City after a round of
job interviews instead of traveling to Atlanta
to watch the Wolverines play for their first
National Championship in 20 years.
As Hindert settled into her chair, she said
with a frustrated sigh that
she had to come back to Ann
Arbor because, well, she just
had too many responsihilities.
If anyone can claim too many
responsibilities, it is certainly
her.
Hindert is the head of mar-
keting for the Student-Athlete
Advisory Committee, a group
that works to connect student-
athletes with the community,
and the director of I Will, a
student campaign to educate
students and raise awareness about sexual
assault at the University.
She ran track for the University for two
years hefore a career ending injury led her to
become a coxswain on therowingbteam.
"It was hard but the rowing team kind of
picked me up," she said.
She hecame involved with SAAC early
on in her University career, helping to plan
events and community service activities to
hring student-athletes "out of their huhble."

Hindert also planned workshops with
Greg Harden, director of athletic counsel-
ing, to educate student-athletes on health
and wellness, including education on sexual
assault.
She soon realized that she wanted to con-
front the endemic problem of sexual assault
on campus - one in four women on college
campuses are sexually assaulted.
"The numbers are so staggering," she said,

Department to use student-athletes as a
platform on which to launch a campus-wide
effort, the I Will organization, to bring about
a conversation with the University commu-
nity about sexual assault.
This has included rebranding some Uni-
versity athletics gear with a teal block 'M'
- teal is the color representing organiza-
tions against sexual assault - and filming
student-athletes for a PSA that will be shown

ambassador-training program for students
who want to work with the organization.
"We're making a positive campaign to just
educate and make people more aware and let
the conversation happen," she said. "By just
doing that, we are just making'a big differ-
ence."
I Will has also been working with Sexual
Assault Prevention & Awareness Center and
the University administration especially
E. Royster Harper, University vice
president of student affairs - to
develop better sexual assault policy.
"They are taking much more seri-
ously," she said. "They have been
amazing and we have haer working
together."
Hindert said sher elieves that
her organization has heen effective
hecause it is a student organization
that is bringing this conversation
forward.
"The only way youare going to
infiltrate andconnect is if you are
student working with students," she said.
Hindert paused and laughed after 25 min-
utes of rapidly describing her career at the
University and her work with I Will and
asked if anything she had just said made any
sense. She looked exhausted and amhitious
and proud.
"(I'm proud of the) fact that it happened,"
she said. "That it actually started and that
next year it is going to he higger and better
now that the foundation is there."

leaning forward in her chair.
She added that she also had disagreed with
the manner in which the University dealt
with sexual assaults.
"(Students) weren't getting much support,
especially from the University," she said. "If
(a student) went and reported it to the Uni-
versity, they would handle in the same way
as if that person who sexually assaulted you
stole your backpack."
Hindert decided to work the Athletics

at Crisler Center, Yost Ice Arena and the Big
House.
The response to the PSA "was unbeliev-
able" Hindert said. "It changed (those sexual
assault statistics) from statistics and num-
bers to people."
She said the organization has been grow-
ing rapidly. They have hosted multiple events
on campus, including an awareness week
this week, where they're going to "paint the
town teal." The group is also developing an
