HOSPITAL
Pescovitz to
step down
from CEO
role in June

LUCK OF THE IRISH

Coleman recommends
Emory University
prof. to fill top health
system position
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
Ora Pescovitz, CEO of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Health System
and executive vice president for
medical affairs, announced in a blog
post Monday morning that she will
step down from her position after
her five-year term ends on June 1.
Pescovitz, the first woman to
serve as the head of the health sys-
tem,hasworkedinher currentposi-
tionsince her2009 appointment.
"I want to express my deep
appreciation to Dr. Pescovitz for
her commitment to Michigan and
for ensuring that the Health System
remains sound and strong, which is
an enormous accomplishment given
our complex environment and the
changingnational health care land-
scape," Coleman wrote in an e-mail
to faculty and staff on Monday.
As EVPMA, Pescovitz oversaw
the University's medical operations
- three main hospitals, 40 outpa-
tient locations and more than 120
clinics around the state - as well as
the Medical School, School of Nurs-
ing and various research initiatives
through various departments and
institutes.

Under Pescovitz's tenure, UMHS
has implemented major renovation
projects, most notably the construc-
tion of the $754 million C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital and Women's
Hospital, completed in 2011. She
also oversaw the transfer of sev-
eral research departments from the
medical campus to the North Cam-
pus Research Complex after the
University purchased the former
Pfizer property in 2009 at a cost of
$108 million.
In a communication to the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents, Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
recommended Michael Johns, pro
fessor of otolaryngology and health
policy at Emory University, to serve
as interim EVPMA effective June 2.
A Detroit native, Johns gradu-
ated from the University's medi-
cal school in 1969 after obtaining a
bachelor's and graduate degree in
biology from Wayne State Univer-
sity.
"I look forward to the leadership,
depth of experience, and vision that
Dr. Johns will bring to the Univer-
sity," Coleman wrote. "I appreciate
his willingness to serve his alma
mater and his home state in this
important way."
Johns formerly served as dean of
the Johns Hopkins School of Medi-
cine and vice president of Medical
Faculty from 1990 to 1996. He later
became the executive vice presi-
dent for health affairs at Emory
before serving as chancellor from

Boar-d to approve projects

Regents to
consider host of
renovation plans at
Thursday meeting
By CLAIRE BRYAN
and YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporters
The University's Board of
Regents will convene Thurs-
day afternoon in the Michigan
Union's Anderson Room to
consider multiple construction
projects, as well as the elimi-
nation of an academic program
within the School of Kinesiol-
ogy. Initiatives slated for the Art
and Architecture Building, the

Ross School of Business and the
C.S. Mott Children's Hospital
and Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital, among others, are
expected to receive approval.
Regents to approve Art and
Architecture Building Reno-
vations
The regents will vote to
approve renovations of the Art
and Architecture Building on
North Campus, which houses
the Taubman College of Archi-
tecture and Urban Planning and
the School of Art & Design. If
approved, the renovations will
consist of an addition to the
original building, which was
constructed in 1974, as well as
minor renovations to the exist-

ing building.
The project will add new
classrooms, studio spaces and
faculty offices.
The project is estimated to
cost $28 million, $12.5 million
of which will come from a gift
from real estate mogul A. Alfred
Taubman, who donated $30
million in 1998 to the College of
Architecture and Urban Plan-
ning, which now bears his name.
In a separate agenda item, the
regents will also vote to name
the addition the A. Alfred Taub-
man Wing in his honor.
Taubman has also funded the
A. Alfred Taubman Health Sci-
ences Library and the A. Alfred
Taubman Medical Research
Institute as well as support for
an expansion of the University

of Michigan Museum of Art.
Pending approval by the
regents, the University will
appoint architecture firm Inte-
grated Design Solutions and
the Preston Scott Cohen firm as
project designers.
Mobility Transformation
Facility moves ahead
Initial schematic designs
and bids for construction con-
tracts of a Mobility Transfor-
mation Facility will also receive
approval. The research facility
- which received approval in
the fall - will simulate auto-
mated and connected driving in
everyday conditions.
For $6.5 million, the facility

ANN ARBOR
City Council
vote to lead
to creation
of new park
Councilmembers in
favor of resolution
say park will provide
safe public space
By EMMA KERR
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor City Council mem-
bers passed a resolution Monday
night granting official council
dedication to the establishment
of an urban park near the Ann
Arbor District Library.
However, councilmem-
bers and community members
debated many concerns with
the resolution, including a lack
of organization and financial
planning, safety and patrol ques-
tions and inconclusiveness as to
whether the property would be
publicly or privately owned and
developed.
Josie Parker, the Ann Arbor
District Library Director who
represented its board, opposed
the creation of a park near the
library due to safety concerns
as well as issues surrounding
the financial and organizational
aspects of the potential park.
According to Parker, Ann Arbor

Governance body
also picks four new
members of SACUA
By ANDREW ALMANI
Daily StaffReporter
On Monday, the University's
Senate Assembly met at Palmer
Commons to select new members
for its executive body, the Senate
Advisory Committee for Univer-
sity Affairs.
Although the necessary quo-
rum to initiate a Senate Assem-
bly meeting was not reached,
the new SACUA members were
elected and members held a dis-
cussion about adjustments to
University policy regarding the
removal of faculty.
The newly-elected SACUA
members include John Lehman,
professor of ecology and evolu-
tionary biology, Pharmaceuti-
cal Sciences Prof. David Smith,
William Schultz, professor of
mechanical engineering, naval
architecture and marine engi-
neering and Silke-Maria Wei-
neck, chair of the Department
of Comparative Literature and
associate professor of German
Studies.

The election process began
with candidates delivering brief
remarks about why they areinter-
ested in the position and which
issues they find most important.
Common themes included con-
cern about future administrative
decisions such as the Adminis-
trative ServicesTransformation,
the lack of faculty input in the
AST decision-making process,
diversity and the importance of
the humanities in the 21st cen-
tury.
The group later examined the
proposed Fitness for Duty section
of the Standard Practice Guide,
concerning proper procedures in
situations where faculty mem-
bers need to be removed involun-
tarily.
SACUA first received a draft
of the SPG in January 2013 from
Christina Whitman, vice provost
for academic and faculty affairs.
Upon review, SACUA founda few
points of concern in the policy
and spent time revising it dur-
ing the summer, returning a new
draft to the University in the fall.
The most recent edition of the
policy, which includes changes
reflecting feedback from SACUA,
was first presented in January
2014 and was discussed at the

Ford School talk
examines how to
reform healthcare
in the U.S.
ByCHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily StaffReporter
Journalist Jonathan Cohn
and Avik Roy, a senior fellow
at the Manhattan Institute,
engaged in a debate on the
recent roll out of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care

Act and its impacts on health
care cost and quality at the
Gerald R. Ford School of Public
Policy Tuesday.
Both Roy and Cohn focused
on the theme of compromise
in the healthcare system in the
event, "Obamacare and Beyond:
How to Reform the U.S. Health
System."
"The truth of all public policy
- liberal, conservative - is that
there are tradeoffs," Cohn said.
Roy worked as a health care
policy adviser to presidential
candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.
He is also currently the opinion

editor at Forbes Magazine. As
the voice of the other side of the
debate, Cohn works as a senior
editor at the New Republic and
the author of "Sick: The Untold
Story of America's Health Care
Crisis."
The debate was often framed
as abalance between health care
services and high healthcare
costs.
Roy said he believes health,
insurance is too expensive.
Referring to the ACA's mandate
that every person in the United
States have health insurance,

- CAMPAIGN TRAIL -,

Robin Beck is an assistant pro-
fessor of Anthropology and serves
as the assistant curator of the Uni-
versity's Eastern North Ameri-
can Archaeology in the Museum
of Anthropological Archaeology.
Since 1994, he has been involved
in the excavation of the oldest
European settlement in the United
States, located i in North Carolina.
He is the author of three books
based on his work in thefield.
Why do you study
archaeology? Why should
people be interested in
archaeology?
In archaeology, we try to
understand what it means to be

human by looking across long
periods of time, and trying to
understand over these long peri-
ods of time how what it means to
be human has changed. You can
see just looking over the last 5,000
years or the last 10,000 years
over the world just how much
our modern civilization is based
on things invented or developed
5,000 or 6,000 or 7,000 years ago.
Different peoples coming togeth-
er to live in the first villages or the
first cities; people planting and
learning how to domesticate the
first things like wheat and maize
and barley and oats; domesticat-
ing cattle and dogs and sheep.
All of that is a part of our ancient
human heritage that makes our

world go around now.
How is your research in North
Carolina going?
We've been focused on an
archaeological site in North
Carolina that contains the ear-
liest European settlement ...
After about 20 years of looking
for it last summer, we actually
found the fort itself. This coming
summer, I'm aiming to have an
archaeological field school, a Uni-
versity of Michigan field school at
the buried site where I'm hoping
to bring 12 undergraduates down
to the site to work on excavating
some of this burned fort.

Parades, cultural festivities Lieutenant Governor discusses

proceed despite tension

statewide financial turnaround

Guinness and NYC
mayor boycott
celebration due to
exclusion of gays
NEW YORK (AP) - A week-
end of St. Patrick's Day revelry
and tensions over the exclusion
of gays in some of the celebra-
tions culminated Monday in
New York, where the world's
largest parade celebrating Irish
heritage stepped off without
the city's new mayor and Guin-
ness beer amid a dispute over
whether participants can carry
pro-gay signs.
The parade of kilted Irish-
Americans and bagpipers set
off on a cold, gray morning.
Hundreds of thousands of
spectators lined Fifth Avenue,
but the shivering, bundled up
crowd was only about half as
thick as in previous years.
Revelers also gathered

elsewhere for green-themed
celebrations, including some
400,000 locals and tourists in
Dublin, where gay rights groups
took part in the festivities.
De Blasio held New York's
traditional St. Patrick's Day
breakfast at Gracie Mansion
with the Irish prime minister,
Enda Kenny, but boycotted the
parade because organizers said
marchers were not allowed
to carry gay-friendly signs or
identify themselves as lesbian,
gay, bisexual or transgender.
Weeks ago de Blasio said he
would skip the parade over the
issue, but Guinness abruptly
dropped its support a day before
the event. The Dublin-based
company pulled sponsorship
assets, including on-air
presence, parade participation
and any promotional materials
that weren't already printed,
although the beer maker
had already made a payment
to parade organizers,
spokeswoman Alix Dunn said.

Other beer companies took
part in the boycotts, with
Samuel Adams withdrawing its
sponsorship of Boston's parade
and Heineken also bagging New
York's parade because of the
exclusion of gays.
Roman Catholic Cardinal
Timothy Dolan, who greeted
passing dignitaries in front of
St. Patrick's Cathedral wearing
a woolen Irish cap over his red
cardinal's skull cap, said he
supports the participation of
individual gays and hoped St.
Patrick's Day could be a day of
unity and joy.
"I know that there are
thousands and thousands of
gay people marching in this
parade," he said. "I know it. And
I'm glad they are."
Police Commissioner
William Bratton marched with
a contingent of uniformed
officers. Gay activists protesting
the exclusion of official LGBT
groups held a news conference
before the march to say they
didn't think the NYPD officers
should participate in uniform.
About two dozen gay rights
advocates protested the parade
holding placards high enough for
marchers to see. "If Danny Boy
were gay, would he be welcome
today?" read one.
Protester Richard Lynch wore
a Guy Fawkes mask, which was
popular among members of the
Occupy Wall Street movement.
He said de Blasio should have
ordered the police commissioner
not to march.
"This was a big mistake,"
Lynch said. "It says the mayor
isn't serious about LGBT
inclusion in this parade."
Across the Atlantic in the land
that inspired St. Patrick's Day,
hundreds of thousands of people
crowded the center of Dublin for
Ireland's major parade. The hour-
long procession featured loads of
wit, brightly colored costumes
and dancers, including from
Ireland's gay community- and
nobody had a public word to say
about it.

Calley addresses
state growth rate
in event hosted by
College Republicans
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Simultaneously lamenting
the broken Michigan of the past
and hailing its bright future,
Lt. Gov. Brian Calley spoke to
the University's chapter of the
College Republicans on Monday
night about rebuilding the state
into a beacon of growth and
success.
Serving as the youngest
lieutenant governor in the
state's history, Calley works
as the second in command to
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.
Calley presides over the
Michigan Senate and assists the
governor in day-to-day actions.
"We went from being a rich
state to being a poor state in just
ten years," Calley said, focusing
on the economic doldrums
between 2001 and 2011.
"What we see now is a return
to the attitude that we used to
have, the spirit that really drove
our state to the top," he added.
"In the last three years, we find
ourselves a top ten state in our
per capita income growth rate."
Calley said the real estate
market in Michigan is on the
rise, as is the expansion of
business. These improvements,
among others, have allowed
the government to exceed
University economic forecasts
three years running, he added.
Another element of Michi-
gan's economic turnaround,
Calley said, has to do with fos-
tering a positive atmosphere
within the state. He said if citi-
zens believe Michigan can come

back from being the "center of
the economic demise," it will.
Calley said Michigan has his-
torically been a bastion of inno-
vation, home to Saran Wrap,
Kitty Litter and a once-thriving
automobile industry. He added
that changing the world is "in
our DNA," and a return to this
climate is not distant.
"Our strategy is, 'How do
we create an environment for
success around the people that
are already here?' " he said.
"We want you to have the best
possible chance of success.
Whatever it is that you want to
do with your life, we want this
to be the best place to do it."
Contingent on this success,
Calley said, is reminding
students in particular that
Michigan is indeed on the
upswing. Part of this has to do
with seeing bankruptcy as a
force of good rather than bad.
"Bankruptcy is not the
problem; bankruptcy is the
beginning of the solution to the
problem," he said.
Despite this, Calley told stu-
dentsthatemployersthroughout
the state are complaining that
they can't find qualified people
to fill positions - the Michigan
Talent Portal has approximately
60,000 open jobs currently.
"So that's incumbent upon
us to make sure that our
education is providing people
with relevant skills to fill those
jobs," he said. "But what we're
finding, unfortunately, is that
it's kind of hard to convince
college graduates that part of
their search ought to be here."
Calley also discussed college
affordability, saying one method
of decreasing the price of higher
education will be giving high
school students the opportunity
to get college credit before they
leave high school.
He encouraged students to

take community college courses
in their senior and junior years
of high school because dual
enrollment courses could ulti-
mately reduce the amount of
time spent at a four-year insti-
tution and in doing so, reduce
the cost of a college degree by25
percent or more, he said.
The University and Michigan
State University do not currently
accept dual credit, which Calley
said he and Snyder are working
to change.
In the meantime, a highlight
of the duo's most recent budget
increases public university
funding by 6.1 percent.
However, this allocation is
only available on a condition of
tuition restraint.
"We expect them to use that
money to make the college
experience more affordable,"
Calley said.
Business senior Michael
Proppe, Central Student
Government president, attended
the meeting and said he was
encouraged by Calley's words.
"The Snyder administration's
proposed increase in higher ed
funding is very important, and
I am glad Brian Calley touched
on that tonight," Proppe wrote
in a statement after the event.
"That said, there is still a lot of
work to do to make college more
affordable, both on the part of
the state and the University."
LSA senior Russ Hayes,
College Republicans chair,
added that he hopes Calley's
tenacity as Lieutenant Governor
spurs others to activism.
"Not only is he a dynamic
politician, he really inspires a
lot of people," Hayes said. "(He
is) someone who really fires
up people our age. He brings
the personal experience and
the economic experience and
the dynamism that comes with
being a young Republican."

2007 to 2012.
The recommendation will go
before the Regents for approval at
their next meeting this Thursaay.
In recent years, the Health
System faced scrutiny because
of a series of internal controver-
sies. In 2012, Stephen Jenson, a
medical resident, was charged for
possession of child pornography,
which was found on a thumb drive
plugged into a Health System
computer. Slow response to the
incident prompted the restruc-
turing of the University's Depart-
ment of Public Safety, Housing
Security and Hospitals & Health
Centers Security into the Division
of Public Safety and Security. Jen-
son was later sentenced to three
years in prison.
Later in 2012, the U.S. Securities
and Exchanges Commission sued
Neurology Prof. Sidney Gilman
in regards to a potential insider-
trading scheme. The commission
alleged that information provided
by Gilman allowed Matthew Mar-
toma, a portfolio manager at CR
Intrinsic Investors, to profit $276
million. Gilman later admitted in
court that he had provided infor-
mation regarding an Alzheimer's
drugtrialtoMartomabefore itwas
released to the public.
More recently, financial pres-
sures from sequestration and
expansion projects have caused
the Health System to explore cost
cutting measures, while steadily
increasing patient demand has
kept the majority of the health
system operating at capacity.
Despite the pressure, Coleman
said the Health System under
Pescovitz has recorded "the high-
est-ever scores in patient satisfac-
tion."The UniversityHospitalwas
rated as the number one hospital
in the state, according to the U.S.
News and World Report 2013 to
2014 rankings.
"I have relished my time here
and will forever be grateful for the
growth, experiences and relation-
ships made possible by this oppor-
tunity," Pescovitz wrote. "UMHS
is a community of extraordinary
people who do extraordinary
work.-I-have been honored to lead
this ucrguinaion which is what
made this decision very difficult
for me."

will work together to design the
project, which will be funded
entirely by investment pro-
ceeds.
The building was commis-
sioned by then-University Pres-
ident Alexander Ruthven in
1935, when he asked the Rack-
ham Fund to realize what he
called "the heart of the Univer-
sity," according to their website.
Revolutionary for its time, the
building itself is known for its
limestone exterior and inclusion
of natural light, along with the
copper roof, which was created
specifically to act as an aesthetic
bridge between the University
and the adjacent residential
area.
The project is slated for com-

Regents to award construction
contracts for Business
School projects
Though the regents approved
renovations to the Stephen M.
Ross School of Business and
Kresge Business Administration
Library, demolition of the Com-
puter and Executive Education
Building last month, authoriza-
tion to award construction con-
tracts for the projects will be
finalized Thursday.
Timothy Slottow, the Uni-
versity's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
wrote ina communication to the

regents that the board will vote
to approve "construction con-
tracts for limited construction
activity" to allow construction
to be completed as early as sum-
mer 2016.
Temporary modular office
units will be installed in the
Lorch Hall courtyard to house
Business School and William
Davidson Institute staff during
the construction process.
Additionally, internal reno-
vations of the main building,
including relocating cooling
towers and rerouting utilities,
will be completed in preparation
for the main project.
This work will cost $7 mil-
lion and is included in the $135
million overall cost of the proj-
ect. Funding for this limited
construction will be provided
by gifts, including the record-
breaking donation gifted by the
school's namesake in the fall.
Contracts to be awarded
for Granger Laboratory
renovations
While the regents approved
schematic designs in July for
the 220,000-gross-square-foot
renovations for the Granger
Library, they will now proceed
to authorize bids and construc-
tion contracts.
The facility, which currently
houses four engineering depart-
ments, was built in 1958. The

Tuesday, March 18, 2014 - 3
lab will undergo $47 million
in renovations to upgrade fire
detection, alarm, emergency
power systems, deep infrastruc-
ture, heating and ventilation. An
additional 25,000 square feet
of academic and instructional
space will be added as well.
The state of Michigan will
fund $30 million of the costs as
part of the fiscal year 2011 Capi-
tal Outlay Request.
Children and Women's
Hospitalto expand with new
operating wing
The University will also seek
approval for plans to expand
into shell space on C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital and Von
Voigtlander Women's Hospi-
tal's fourth floor to create a new
operating room.
The Hospital and Health Cen-
ter will provide $4.5 million
to build out an additional 800
square feet of space adjacent to
a current operating room. The
project will provide standard
operating room capabilities as
well as the ability to use the
space for future pediatric car-
diovascular procedures.
The funds will provide the
room's equipment and all the
architectural, mechanical and
electrical work. Architecture
firm HKS will design the project
and completion is expected by
winter 2015.


COUNCIL
From Page 1
Police are already called to the
library every third day due to
drunk and disorderly conduct of
individuals in the area - an issue
worsened due to the extreme
conditions this winter.
"It takes a tremendous amount
of planning and organization
and thought to manage a public
space," Parker said. "The safety
concerns are real. It isn't about
making a problem worse; it's
about acknowledging a reality.
We're not saying no park, we are
saying take the time to plan it
given the context of the reality of
what is happening."
Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman (D-Ward 3) disagreed,
saying he hopes to bring this

space back to its former use as an
open plaza, and saw the AADL
board's concerns to be fear-mon-
gering without significant base.
"The bad behavior that they
are talking about is not related
to this plaza," Kunselman said.
"We are not going to resolve bad
behavior just by design."
Some public speakers and
council members called on the
failure of Liberty Plaza - a public
space located on Liberty Street
with a reputation of holding indi-
viduals who engage in public
intoxication. Those in opposition
to the resolution urged council
members to ensure they have the
resources and planning in place
to manage a new park and ensure
its success.
Councilmember Jack Eaton
(D-Ward 4), who voted for
the resolution, discussed the
broadness of the resolution in

terms of their plan to turn over
the space to the park advisory
committee.
"During the formulation of the
various versions of the resolu-
tion, some of these concerns are
really fiction," Eaton said. "They
just don't want apark downtown,
and it's really unfortunate."
Eaton also addressed another
detail surrounding the creation
of the park, urging the council
to ensure this park is publicly
owned, rather than controlled
by a private developer - a mea-
sure called for by the city's Parks
Advisory Commission.
"A private owner is a repudia-
tion of the very nature of this
public space," Eaton said. "I
ask that we simply draw these
lines, send it back to PAC and
ask for their input on what the
appropriate use of this space is,
and I think that is a very simple

thing. "
Councilmember Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) spoke of the poten-
tial for creativity in this space.
Though she said she does not
support moving Sonic Lunch, an
outdoor summer concert series at
Liberty Park, to the possible 5th
Avenue park, the loose nature of
this resolution leaves room for
input from PAC and other needs
that may arise.
AnnArbor Mayor John Hieftje
was not in support of the resolu-
tion, saying council members are
attempting to create a new park
inthehopes ofescapingthe prob-
lems of Liberty Plaza instead of
facing the issues at hand.
Councilmembers Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) and Margie
Teall (D-Ward 4) voted against
the resolution. Councilmember
Sally Hart Petersen (D-Ward 2)
was not present.
health standpoint, that all of these
benefits are great," Roy said. "But
they have costs."
The two presenters were divid-
ed on the issue of mental health
coverage. Under the new laws,
newly issued insurance plans are
required to provide some level of
compensation for mental health
issues.
"I want a system where no mat-
ter what happens to you, you'll
be protected," Cohn said. "I
think that includes mental health
because mental health is a huge
problem in this country."
In opposition to Cohn, Roy said
mental health should not neces-
sarily have tobe covered by health
insurance.
Earlier in the debate, Roy said
he would like to have health insur-
ance for incidents that cannot be
prevented, but not for others. He
argued that while most Ameri-
cans would agree to pay for the
medical expenses of a child born
with Down syndrome, Americans

he countered the idea that young
people who have not purchased
health insurance are "slackers."
Instead, Roy said it often does not
make economic sense for young
people to have insurance.
Cohn said that the ACA was
a necessary compromise to help
those he considered the "victims"
of America's healthcare system.
He added that preceding the pas-
sage of the ACA there were 45
million uninsured Americans and
millions more with inadequate
coverage.
"It (the effects of the ACA)
won't be perfect ... but we will be
in a better place," Cohn said.
Roy said he believes the ACA
will make healthcare more expen-
sive.
"You might think from a per-
sonal standpoint, from a public

might not want to agree to pay to
cover the costs of a smoker who
has developed chronic pulmonary
disease.
"I mightnot wantto have insur-
ance that covers me from becom-
ing a crack addict," Roy said.
Cohn said insurance is neces-
sary for everyone because serious
health issues can occur suddenly.
"Every single person in this
room is an accident, a heart
attack, something catastrophic
away from needing insurance,"
Cohn said.
Tracy Anderson, a clinical
instructor in the School of Nurs-
ing, said she brought her nursing
students to the event so they will
be prepared to transition to the
ACA's new policies.

meeting Monday.
SACUA Chair Karen Staller
described the purpose of the
policy, which intends to be used
as a last resort. Moreover, the
policy can only be implemented
when "observable conduct has
raised a substantial and serious
question or concern" on a given
faculty member's performance,
accordingto Staller.

"This policy addresses the
process and criteria to be used
when considering the timely
involuntary removal of a fac-
ulty member who is unable to
perform the essential functions
of his position despite reason-
able accommodations," Staller
said.
SACUA wrote a memo with
six specific concerns addressed
to Women's Studies Prof. Chris-
tina Whitman, a SACUA mem-
ber, and the Human Resources
department. This memo was
presented to members at the

meeting, along with a copy of
the SPG itself.
"This is being presented to
you today with the express
desire to get feedback from
you," Staller said.
Jeffery Frumkin, associ-
ate vice provost for Academic
and Faculty Affairs and senior
director of Academic Human
Resources, answered questions
about the policy from faculty at
the meeting.

ing of the semester will take

A punishment to fit the crime
The 'U' needs to adopt stricter sanctions for forced sexual penetration
artmouth College has proposed changes to its sexual assault
policy, calling for expulsion in most cases where a student is found
guilty of "penetration accomplished by force, threat or purposeful
incapacitation or where an assault involving penetration is motivated bybias."
Both Dartmouth and the University of Michigan are under investigation by
the U.S. Department of Education due to accusations of mishandling sexual
assault cases. While the University has made strides in improving its process
for investigating and handling sexual assault cases, there remains room for
improvement for the punishment for these offenses. The University's current
policy leaves too much leeway in punishing determined offenders, leaving
open the possibility of offenders slipping through the cracks or getting off
too lightly. The University should consider strengthening the potential
punishments for student sexual misconduct and reducing the discretion
of the Office of Student Conflict Resolution in assigning these penalties.

According to a Centers for Disease Control
study, 19 percent of college women reported
experiencing attempted or completed sexual
assault during their college career. With sexual
violence averages on college campuses higher
than the national average, University policy
changes need to follow recognition of the
problem and adopt stricter punishments similar
to those outlined in Dartmouth's proposal.
A mandatory expulsion policy for sexual
assault in the case of sexual penetration
ensures that committing a heinous crime
means facingaserious punishment. Especially
in light of the University's response to the
public disclosure of former Michigan kicker
Brendan Gibbons' permanent separation
and resulting protest, it is important that the
University send a strong signal that sexual
assault will be taken seriously on campus.
The current wording of the University's
sexual assault policy, using phrases such as
"reprimand" and "Potential Sanctions or
Interventions," is too weak.
While it is important that stricter policies be
put in place, it is equally important to ensure
that they are as supportive and beneficial to
the survivor as possible. According to the
Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network,
about two-thirds of rapes were committed by
someone the survivor knew. The University
should keep the "Resolution by Agreement"
portion of the sexual assault policy, which
allows the Complainant and Respondent to
either accept or reject a proposed agreement in
regards to what the sanctions or interventions
will be regarding their case. This process
should be kept so the survivor has input with
regards to the punishment the respondent

receives. This may include someone who does

steps to protect their identities and the identity
of the assailant. However, there should be
policies in place that to make certain survivor
isn't intimidated or threatened by the assailant
or anyone else while this process takes place.
Furthermore, the University needs to
refocus on education incoming freshmen
about sexual assault. The Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center's
Relationship Remix, the mandatory program
for students living in dorms, should include
information about steps to take if you
are sexually assaulted. Knowing how to
preserve DNA evidence on the body or
clothes and knowing who to go to in order
to report an assault could ultimately lead to
a more successful investigation. Information
about counseling and medical services for
victims could be life saving. Furthermore,
the consequences for being convicted by
the courts or found responsible for sexual
assault by the University should be presented.
Furthermore, the University should call on
organizations like SAPAC to help increase
education for students on campus about
sexual assault. Education will foster cultural
awareness and reduce stigma associated
with incidences of sexual assault.
The University's sexual assault policy
should be made stricter by incorporating
mandatory expulsion for proven assailants.
The wording of the policy reflects the severity
of sexual assault, signaling appropriate
respect for the trauma and long-lasting effects
of sexual assault for survivors.

Earlier this year, an amazing,
inspiring group of women created
a new student group on campus:
the Michigan Women of Color Col-
lective. This collective has united
women of color from every corner
of the University and seeks to pro-
vide a safe space for us to discuss
the issues we face - from overt rac-
ism to the microaggressions we face
daily that often are neglected, dele-
gitimized and trivialized.
After attending the first few
meetings, I felt a concoction of
emnotions. I related to many of the
women in the room, and their sto-
ries and testimonies caused me to
reflect on my own experiences in
an attempt to identify instances
of racism, bigotry and sexism that
I hadn't previously considered.
These women made me realize
that, as an Arab American Muslim
woman, I had often been tokenized
both in and out of the classroom at
a young age and forced to speak on
behalf of an entire racial, ethnic
and religious community.
I learned that it wasn't my duty
to educate, and the anxiety I felt
having to be the spokesperson for
Arabs and Muslims in all sorts of
spaces was warranted and legiti-
mate. How would I possibly be
able to provide enough context and
nuance when describing a religion
practiced by billions, or an identity
that hundreds of millions across
the world shared? It simply didn't
make sense, and this space provid-
ed me with a sense of relief that this
overwhelming feeling of stress and
confusion wasn't exclusive to me.
However, I also felt a certain
level of discomfort in the space and
at first couldn't understand why.
This resulted in my reluctance to
share as much and a greater inter-
est in hearing the experiences of the
other women in the room. I came to
realize that there were oppressions
and barriers I would never have to
face because of my privileges (hav-
ing fairer skin and being a part of
the upper-middle class). I also real-
ized that my privileges often came
at the expense of other brown and
Black bodies.
I grew up in the bubble that is

Bloomfield Hills. Bloomfield Hills
is not only one of the wealthiest cit-
ies in the state of Michigan, but in
the entire nation. While I did face
racism growing up, I belonged to a
sizable Arab and Muslim commu-
nity, not to mention that my socio-
economic privilege, coupled with
my skin color (which falls in some
awkward place between light and
medium when picking out makeup),
gave me the opportunity to forego
many of the oppressions that poor-
er and darker Arabs and Muslims
face, both nationally and beyond.
I come from an Iraqi family; when
I meet people, they are often sur-
prised when I reveal my nationality
in conversation. I've been told mul-
tiple times that I am "too pretty" or
"too light" to be Iraqi. This always
confused me because the Iraqis who
I interact with, the ones in my family,
look like me. I realized soon enough
that the same people who were mak-
ing these harsh, racist generaliza-
tions were typically interacting with
the poor, darker-skinned refugee
population of Iraqis both in the Unit-
ed States and in countries I visited
abroad, such as Jordan and Lebanon.
My mother's skin is even lighter
than mine. Combine her fair skin
with her green eyes and light brown,
almost dirtyblonde hair. When meet-
ing some of her relatives for the first
time this past summer, her cousin
immediately asked me why I wasn't
pretty like my mother, why I didn't
inherit the green eyes or the fair skin
that my mother claimed. I hadn't
experienced anything like it before;
the man looked at me disgustedly, as
if I was subhuman simply because I
had dark, thick hair, dark eyes and a
slightly darker complexion than my
mother. I was somehow a lesser ver-
sion of her because of my color and
my darker features.
This was when I began to under-
stand that while I am a person of
color, there are many privileges I
enjoy based on my color and my class.
This is when I began to understand
colorism on a deeper level, that I
would be judged relative to the other
people of color around me. This is
when I began to understand that rac-
ism is an issue of black and white;

the whiter you are, even as a person
of color, the less oppression you face
and the easier it is for you to assimi-
late into the ideals of whiteness.
I struggle reconciling these inter-
secting identities and privileges, and
also struggle at times identifying
as a person of color because of how
different my experiences have been
based on my lighter skin, as well as
my privileges as an upper-middle-
class, heterosexual, cisgendered,
able-bodied person. While there are
certain settings where I feel com-
fortable claiming the "person of
color" label to build political solidar-
ity across non-white communities,
there are probably more instances
when the label can be deceitful in its
implication of a monolithic experi-
ence and narrative of what is actually
an overwhelmingly nuanced, diverse
group of people. This is particularly
misleading when the label "people
of color" includes non-Black POCs
like myself, who indirectly reap the
benefits of white supremacy and are
complicit in a system that promotes
anti-Black culture.
Being aware of the privileges I
hold and the role that I play as a non-
Black woman of color has helped me
become cognizant of the space I take
up in settings with other women of
color, namely Black women who are
oftentimes the direct targets of any
form of racism - even racism that is
directed at me, and especially racism
initiated or perpetuated by my com-
munity and other non-Black commu-
nities of color.
So as a "person of color," I reflect
on the ways I benefit from and am
complacent in these systems of
oppression. Because the term "per-
son of color" isn't enough for me and
it certainly isn't enough for those
under the label whose oppression I
am too privileged to know or ever
claim as my own.

'Resurrection' soars
By GRACE HAMILTON
Daily Arts Writer

DEF JAM
"I'm coming for you, Kendrick"
YG gets 'Krazy' o
successful debut

Lethal chemistry
with DJ Mustard
visible in album
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily MusicEditor,
Earlier this year, YG made
the dubious assertion that he
and his producer DJ Mustard
were the next
Snoop and Dr.
Dre. While this
is just utterly My Krazy
ridiculous, it's
easy to forget Life
how 20 years yG

in the midst of the West Coa st
rap resurgence spearheaded by
Kendrick Lamar and his TDE
crew, the impact of Mustard,
YG and their extended family
can't be overlooked. In fact,
YG and Kendrick make for a
fascinating pair themselves -
Kendrick the intellectual, YG the
gangbanger; Kendrick the sober
contemplator, YG the inebriated
celebrator. It's easy, then, to
dismiss YG as a one-dimensional
ratchet music exploiter who
got a deal based on Mustard's
catchy production. But while My
Krazy Life, YG's Def Jam debut,
is no good kid, m.A.A.d city, it
is equal in honesty, personality
and a dedication to exploring the
complicated life of growing up in
Compton.
Under the supervision of
executive producers Jeezy
and Mustard, the latter of
whom handles most of the
production, My Krazy Life is
surprisingly cohesive, with
smooth transitions between
songs, skits holding together
central themes and even a loose
storyline running throughout.
Like Kendrick's debut, the
album is steeped in classic L.A.
rap tradition. Mustard utilizes
Dre-esque synths and twinkling
pianos and YG's oftentimes
frantic and slurred flow channels

We've seen this story time

the visuals. After one episode,
it's impossible to tell whether
"Believe" will go the way of
shows like "FlashForward"
and "The Event," or if it will
actually be able to go the dis-
tance. The pilot creates rela-
tionships, a visual template
and a plot that is gripping, but
offers no hints as to whether

son of TV.
"Believe" follows a man
named Tate (Jake McLaugh-
lin, "Warrior") who is broken
out of death row by members
of a mysterious organization
led by Winter (Delroy Lindo,
"The Chicago Code"). They
do this to enlist his assistance
in protecting a girl named Bo
(newcomer Johnny Sequoyah)
from the evil people who are
trying to take advantage of her
mysterious powers. As they
travel, Bo helps people believe
in themselves; in the pilot she
helps a doctor who considers
quitting his job after a patient
dies.
With the setup of this prem-
ise, "Believe" starts telling a
story with a lot of information
to reveal. A lot of the plot in
the pilot is setting up a com-
plicated mythology, with many
secrets involving the true moti-
vations of the "good" and "evil"
organizations and how much
power Bo has. It's yet another
serialized series that offers

season (or multiple seasons). It
could easily get bogged down
in creating more questions,
and not building the story they
already have in place.
Thebest element of "Believe"
is going to be the hardest one to
repeat on a week-to-weekbasis.
Newly-minted Oscar winner
Alfonso Cuar6n ("Gravity")
directed the pilot, creating a
diverse, unique visual tem-
plate. While this show doesn't
come close to "Hannibal" in
terms of visual quality, its pat-
terns are different from any-
thing else on television. What's
worrisome, however, is the fact
that Cuar6n won't be directing
every episode. The show's mix
of some well-choreographed
action sequences and visually
interesting scenes involving
characters sitting around and
talking created a template that
is going to be very tough to
emulate, robbing the show of
one of it's best aspects.
Another very strong char-
acteristic of the pilot is how

it immediately starts develop-
ing the relationships between
the characters. Right as Jake
and Bo, who are the two cen-
tral characters, meet for the
first time, the show establish-
es a connection between the
two of them. As the episode
moves forward, they estab-
lish a rapport that's fascinat-
ing to watch. If the show gets
bogged down in the serialized
elements or the visuals lack
the exciting nature of the pilot,
this will be the easiest aspect
to maintain and may be the
component that saves the show
from falling into mediocrity.
"Believe" has a lot going
for it. Cuar6n is a ridiculously
talented filmmaker, and his
work as a writer and director
for the premiere was excel-
lent. However, he's not going
to be involved on a day-to-day
basis and once he steps back on
his involvemen, it's not cer-
tain whether the great story-
line and unique visuals will be
maintained. The pilot is well
done, but it's too soon to tell if
the series will be.

Remember back in 2012,
that one day when Wikipe-
dia, Reddit and a few of yout
other favorite procrastinatio
sites went dark? For some, it
was just an
annoyance
- but many
others
realized
that some-
thing big
was going
down, and ELLIOT
that web- ALPERN
sites don't
suddenly
go dark for some trifling rea
son. In a matter of days, the
bill known as SOPA - the
Stop Online Piracy Act - wa
dead on arrival from the pub
lic pressure. Cue the pride
of victory, that warm fuzzy
feeling that democracy couli
actually work when we the
people realized we needed t
bond together.
Because, really, the stakes
were high enough to warran
losing a full day's revenue fo
most websites. Under SOA,
copyright holders could shu
down any infringing site wit
a quick court order. And any
one who streamed anything
illegally - be it a song, an
album, a TV show - was lia-
ble for up to 5 years in priso
But we don't have to worr
about that any more, right?
After all, we slayed the two-
headed SOPA hydra and the
lesser-discussed PIPA. Sure
those media execs ran home
with their tails between the
legs, never to try the will of
the American people again.
Unfortunately, as many of
you could guess by the flavo
of this column, that's not ev
close to the case.
Those same lobbyists who
pushed hard for the renewet
prosecution of online pirate
have had a revelation. Why
slog through the very visible
swamp that was SOPA, when
dealing in the shadows work
just as well?
This brings us to two new
theaters of war for, more or
less, the same damn issue -
only now, there's less we cat
do about it.
At the very least, you
might have heard of this firs
battlefront: the Trans-Pacif
Partnership. The TPP mas-
querades as a behemoth free
trade deal between a dozen
or so countries, and has bee:
under constant negotiation
for almost a decade.
Why would anyone care
about trade policies? As you
may have guessed, much is
afoot underneath the true
purpose of this agreement,
which itself is murky - no
one will make the text of thi
draft available, and it took
the efforts of Wikileaks to
show us the dark underbelly
of what we're up against. Th
Verge, a popular tech websit
summed up best what we ha
to fear from the influence o1
copyright lobbyists.
"Many of the criticisms
focus on the treaty's 'enforc
ment' section, which includ'
language that critics say ml

rors similar provisions from
America's controversial SOP
and ACTA bills. This includi
provisions that ... critics
say would further establish
ISPs as a de facto copyright
police."
While all of this sounds
like something we should
start rallying against as soo
as possible, the problem
exists in the fact that the TIP
doesn't necessarily have tog

through Congress. Presidents
have had the power to "fast-
r track" trade policies before -
in and if that power is renewed,
this could get shoved into
reality before we even have a
say in it.
Another proposed practice
also seems to be strengthen-
ing of copyright law - some-
thing known as "Notice and
Staydown." While the pro-
posal is still in infancy, its
nature is somewhat ominous.
At a basic level, Notice and
Staydown means that, if a
website is sent a "takedown"
- notice regarding copyright
infringement of some piece of
media, it must then immedi-
s ately destroy all copies of that
- media and actively prevent
the media from being upload-
ed again. While this may
d seem like a fair point, anyone
who knows how copyright law
o actually works will recognize
that this isn't a solution, but
rather that it is a vast blanket
t that will affect both legal and
ir illegal distribution of art-
work.
t Notice and Staydown isn't
:h nearly the threat that the TPP
- will be, but both show that
n. Piracy actually
helps business.
ly copyright lobbyists won't stop
until copyright law is revised
ir for their interests and active-
ly enforced. Which, really, is
stupid when you look at the
evidence.
r Yes, piracy is illegal. Down-
en loading something you should
pay for is illegal. But if music
execs want to make as much
d money as they can, they'll
s stop pursuing piracy and
focus on making th'i~rfoduct
as affordable and available as
possible, because, believe it
s or not, piracy actually helps
business.
Last year, the Institute for
Prospective Technological
Studies (part of the Euro-
n pean Commission's Joint
Research Centre) analyzed
digital music piracy over five
it countries from 16,000 partici-
ic pants. The execs work under
the assumption that every
album downloaded is $10 or
more instantly evaporated in
n a puff of torrenting. But the
IPTS concluded that "digital
music piracy does not dis-
place legal music purchases,"
and even more, that "illegal
music consumption could
also, in theory, stimulate legal
music consumption." The
study found that, for every
e 10 percent increase in the
number of illegal downloads,
there was a two percent rise
7 in legal sales. Obviously, cor-
te relation is easier to establish
:e, than causation, but it seems
ve that music piracy, at the very
f least, doesn't do as much
harm as advertised.
So where do we go? It's
e- tough to figure out - but
es for the ever-optimistic side
r- of me, I'd like to think that

* democracy can still achieve
'A something for the people. So
es keep an eye out for the TPP
and Notice and Staydown,
and when any of it comes into
the public light, do what you
can to be a part of democratic
progress.

Four years later: Shaun Bernstein's final run

Senior putting
final touches on
successful, but
injury-riddled
Michigan career
By DAVID MALINOWSKI
Daily Sports Writer
It was the end of practice at
the Baseline Tennis Center in
Minneapolis for the Michigan
men's tennis team as it was
making its first Big Ten road
trip of the season. With the
coach's echoes of "last two
points" billowing through the
courts, senior Shaun Bernstein
started his serving motion,
pulling his racket down and
tossing the furry yellow ball
high into the air.
Something didn't feel right.
Sharp pains like the prickles
of a cactus filled up Bernstein's
right shoulder and upper back
with a numbing sensation
tingling down the right side of
his body. As Bernstein went to
serve again, his arm refused
to obey the commands of his
brain, instead rebelling and
responding with more pain. It
was this moment that would
alter his career forever.
For as long as he can
remember, Bernstein has stared
his opponents down from
the other side of a mesh-knit
net. The court was a place of
enthralling battles, increased
heart rates, black marks from
tennis shoes and straegizing
where to hit his next shot.
At the age of 22, however, he
has come up against his biggest
opponent of all: reality.
Professional tennis is no
longer an option. The stout
Michigan captain of men's
tennis is now entering the
final stretch of his career, one
that was filled with adversity,
success, but one all too surreal
at certainpoints.
"It has served its purpose,"
Bernstein said, reflecting on
his tenure as the captain of the
Michigan men's tennis team. "It
has been an incredible run."
In an interviewwith the Daily
his freshman year, Bernstein
expressed optimism about
becoming a leader on and off the
court at the University. Now a
senior, he has spent three years
as a team captain, sacrificing
body and mind to ensure the
on-court success of the team.
As a promising recruit
four years ago, Bernstein has
gone through virtually every
ordeal in his four years at the
Michigan. He experienced
peaks and valleys to the tune of
balls popping off of dense nylon
strings, and he had some days,
both dark and light.
Bernstein, a former top-20
underage player in the United
States, has gone as far as
representing the United States
at the Junior Davis Cup. At the
age of 13, Bernstein traveled to
the Czech Republic with the
likes of Andy Roddick, Robby
Ginepri and up-and-coming
Ryan Harrison to carry the
American flag on the tennis

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Michigan senior Shaun Bernstein came to Ann Arbor as a prospect loaded with potential, but injuries have forced him to abandon his professional dreams.

court.
Considered a "can't miss"
prospect with so much room to
develop, Bernstein hasn't had
a standout record, amassing a
35-45 singles record and a 56-42
in doubles.
As one of the most well-
rounded individuals to walk
the Michigan tennis courts,
Bernstein's four years in Ann
Arbor will be full of misfortune
and hypotheticals.
Ask any athlete about his
upbringing and he or she will
give a long dissertation about
parents. Bernstein refused to
react differently.
Growing up on Long Island,
N.Y., tennis took up a large
majority of his life from a young
age. As early as middle school,
Bernstein was training six
days a week in gyms, on courts
and around town. His mother
managed to convince him to do
homework in the car rather than
staring blankly at the flowing
landscape outside the window.
Of course, the homework was
important, as the work ethic
that made Bernstein strive to be
a complete player also kept him
going in the classroom.
"She was incredible,"
Bernstein said of his mother.
"We would spend so much time
(together) growing up ... and
tennis is very significant with
the travel."
Driving from tournament
to tournament, up and down
the East Coast, did create its
opportunities for quality time
in the car, but also a debt of
appreciation.
"I will forever be extremely
grateful and indebted to (my
parents) that they sacrificed a
lot of time, money, emotional
engagement, helping me out
through the highs and the
lows," Bernstein said. "They
were everything to me."

Due to injury, Bernstein's
leadership took a turn from
leading by stellar play to
exemplifying a team-first
attitude through sacrifice.
With a healthier body this year,
however, Bernstein has some
work to do on the court.
The biggest challenge this
season for Bernstein as well as
the rest of the team has been
fillingthevoid leftby formerAll-
American King. King, one of the
best players in school history,
owns the program record for
most combined singles and
doubles wins at 196.
The son of a certified public
accountant who practices in
the New York area, Bernstein
enrolled in the Ross School of
Business to carry on the family
craft.
"Once tennis wasn't going to
work out after school, getting
a good education and being
in the Michigan network was
invaluable," he said. "Ultimately
the decision to come to
Michigan, which was the best
balance of academics and tennis,
had its biggest perks."
The 22-year-old senior
in the business school has a
concentration in finance, and
plans to practice commerce
after college, trading in his
athletic clothing and tennis
shoes for a suit, tie and a new
home in North Carolina.
But there are still three
months remaining in the tennis
season, and that is the only thing
that he's thinking about.
"We're doing our best this
vear (without King) to do

a better job of being more
competitive and push ourselves
always day to day," he said. "If
we could get a ring, we'd be
extremely, extremely proud of
what we accomplished."
He wants to be an All-
American, but his goals boil
down more to the health of the
team as well as himself.
"I love the sport now more
than ever," he said. "I love
competing."
In the back of his mind,
Bernstein knows what lies
ahead of him. As a kid who grew
up aspiring to go professional,
Bernstein will fall short of his
childhood dreams. Between his
body's wear and tear and injury
history, competitive tennis is no
longer an option. Instead, he has
endured the stress of a different
type of recruiting season, one
that involved dressing up in a
suit and tie and sending crisply
printed rdsumds to employers.
There wasn't much Bernstein
could control throughout his
collegiate tennis career. The
helpless feeling of losing match
after match and immolating an
asset in a big first serve was a
major battle.
"I would have liked to
stay healthy for longer," he
acknowledged, "but other than
that (I have) no regrets."
For now, Bernstein is racing
the clock. If only for alittle while,
Bernstein and the Wolverines
have a chance at completing a
successful season and qualifying
for national play. While the
window on playing competitive
tennis is going to be all but
closed within a few months,
perhaps Bernstein has found his
opportunity for cheating in his
match with reality.
If looking in a mirror every
morning with a suit on gets too
mundane, perhaps there is room
to return to a court within the
near future. Bernstein is a team-
first player, and he sees himself
as a potential asset to a college
program as a coach. However,
he's not readyto fully committo
that concept yet.
Through all of the pain,
sacrifice, deliberation and
conflict, Bernstein is ready to
move on. Tennis has given him
an avenue to grow as a person
in every category, through an
opportunity that very few have
the ability to experience. He is
thankful for his time at Michigan,
and while tennis is going to take
on a smaller role in his life after
graduation, the sport he loves and
the lessons it has taught him will
never leave him.
"Tennis will remain a small
part of my life as long as I'm
healthy enough to pick up a
racket."

Senior Shaun Bernstein has amassed a 35-45 singles record at Michigan.

Guptill pleads guilty to assault

Reason revealed
for forward's prior

Michigan hockey forward
Alex Guptill, an LSA junior,
attended a hearing at the 15th
District Court on Monday
afternoon in response to an
incident he was involved in on
Sept. 16, 2013.
Guptillwas originallycharged
with two counts of assault and
battery after an undisclosed
incident on the University's
campus, but his terms were
reduced to one assault charge -
a misdemeanor - contingent on
complete compliance with the
terms of his probation.
Guptill's legal counsel
requested consideration for a
program that would allow the
charge to eventually be removed
from his record if he is able
to successfully complete his
probation. The Wayne County
Prosecutor will determine his
eligibility for the program, but
there's no word yet on if it will
be granted.

'M' seeks consistency at
renovated Aum- ni Fi'el

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan men's basketball
coach John Beilein didn't
take a broad look at the
Midwest regional when it was
announced on Sunday during
the Selection Show.
Though Beilein couldn't
ignore the No. 2 seed given to the
seventh-ranked Wolverines and
their second-round opponent,
No. 15-seed Wofford, he, for
the most part, didn't seem
to care or notice the array of
championship-caliber teams in
this year's "region of death."
Though it's too early to start
going through every possible
scenario Michigan (15-3 Big Ten,
25-8 overall) could encounter in
its attempt to make it back to the
Final Four, the Daily looks at the
possible matchups this weekend.
Second Round: No. 15
Wofford (11-5 Southern
Conference, 20-12)
The Terriers earned an
automatic bid to the Big Dance
by defeating Western Carolina
in their conference tournament,
56-53, after finishing third in the
regular season.
Similar to Michigan, Wofford

is led by a pair of sophomore
guards - Karl Cochran (15.7
points and five rebounds per
game) and Spencer Collins (12.8
points per game).
The last time Michigan played
Wofford was Dec. 2, 2006. In
that game, an 83-49 Wolverine
victory, Michigan led by as many
as 37 points in the second half as
the Terriers shot 30 percent from
the field.
Fun Fact: Wofford's third-
leading scorer, Lee Skinner, has
a tattoo sleeve on his left arm
highlighted by an intimidating
Terrier that appears to be
scowling at a moon in the
background. Behind the animal's
ear is a'W,' representing Wofford.
Third Round: No. 7 Texas
(11-7 Big 12, 23-10) or No. 11
Arizona State (10-8 Pac-12,
21-11)
Both schools received at-large
bids after finishing third in the
regular season in their respective
conferences.
Texas is led by forward
Jonathan Holmes (13 points and
7.2 rebounds per game) and guard
Isaiah Taylor (12.5 points and 3.9
assists per game).
The Longhorns had their most
successful stretch of the season

during January and February
when they went on a seven-game
winning streak, beating Iowa
State, Kansas State, Baylor and
Kansas - all NCAA Tournament
teams - consecutively.
Arizona State's two leading
scorers are guard Jahii Carson
(18.6 points per game) and
Jermaine Marshall (15 points per
game), who played his previous
three seasons at Penn State.
While at State College last season,
Marshall was the Nittany Lions'
second-leading scorer and was
instrumentalintheir upsetvictory
over Michigan in February.
Perhaps the most well-
known connection between the
Wolverines and the Sun Devils is
Bill Frieder, the former Michigan
coach who was famously
fired before the 1989 NCAA
Tournament, in which Michigan
won its only national title.
Fun Facts: Despite having
arguably the best player in the
NBA, Kevin Durant, in 2007, the
Longhorns only won one game
in the 2007 NCAA Tournament.
Former Wolverine walk-on Sai
Tummala, who redshirted at
Michigan in 2011-12, transferred
to Arizona State this year. The
sophomore averages 2.1 points
per game while balancing a pre-
med workload.

Weather threatens
to cancel game
By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
After months of construction,
the Michigan softball team
began moving its championship
hardware into the main room of
its newly opened headquarters
last week. Big Ten championship
trophies, College World Series
trophies, regional trophies and
even a golden bat highlighted the
treasure trove the Wolverines
have collected in seasons past.
Tuesday, though, this
Michigan team will continue
fighting for its next piece of
memorabilia when it hosts its
first home game of the season.
The eighth-ranked
Wolverines will, pending a
game-time weather decision,
play Bowling Green at Alumni
Field for their home opener at
4 p.m.
"Playing at home is a whole
different animal, and it is
anything but routine," said
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
Sunday. "We've been on the road
and played 25 games, and now
we're going to be at home. We
need to settle in and make sure
home becomes not a distraction,

and we need to protect our
house."
In her 30th season as a coach,
Hutchins has a team loaded
with talent, with plenty of stars
returning from a 2013 College
World Series run and a pitching
staff any program would envy.
It's also a team with remaining
question marks.
Junior right-hander Sara
Driesenga, once considered the
de facto starter, has had a rough
first third of the season and is
still lookingto regain form.
Freshman Megan Betsa, a
righty as well, has thrown a
barrage of strikeouts while also
giving away far too many free
bases.
The offense has shortened
plenty of games behind a strong
sophomore season from star
shortstop Sierra Romero and
senior first baseman Caitlin
Blanchard, but it has also
struggled in close games against
underwhelming competition.
In hindsight, though,
Michigan (19-6) has to be happy
with its 3-4 record against top-
10 competition. Wins over No. 5
Kentucky, No. 4 UCLA and No.
7 Arizona helped vindicate the
work the team has put in during
the offseason and the talent
added this year.
Early losses aren't season-

breaking in college softball,
and the Wolverines have shown
flashes of brilliance in addition
to the ability to fight through
adversity. As the home season
and Big Ten play begin, the
challenge is to find consistency.
Michigan drilled full-
count scenarios in practice
last week and has tried to live
up to Hutchins' "one-pitch
softball" mantra all season, but
sophomore outfielder Sierra
Lawrence said Sunday that what
the team really needs to do is
stay loose and have fun. If it can
do that, Lawrence said, the one-
pitch mentality will follow.
"A Michigan softball team
that has fun is a good Michigan
softball team," Hutchins said.
The matchup against Bowling
Green (6-13-1) is one that the
Wolverines should, on paper,
win. The Falcons are just 5-30
all time against Michigan, but
the pressure of a home opener is
undeniable.
Regardless of previous
records, the game will be a true
test for the Wolverines. There is
no question Michigan has talent,
but the matchup will rather be a
test to see how much the team
has grown during its cross-
country blitz against some of the
competition it will likely meet
again come May.

Michigan men's basketball coach John Beilein led his team to the Midwest's No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
