THINKING ABOUT HOW WE THINK

Leaders discuss how
stimulus dollars can
further economic
growth in Michigan
By LILLIAN XIAO
Daily StaffReporter
Why the University of Michi-
gan? Why now?
These were the questions
posed by Stephen Forrest, the
University's vice president for
research, at yesterday's Institute
of Social Research event called
"Leveraging Federal Stimu-
lus Dollars at the University of
Michigan-and theeate of Michi-
gan."
At the event, University
administrators and U.S. Rep.
John Dingell (D-Mich.) spoke
about how the University is using
grants from the American Rein-
vestment and Recovery Act to
further research at the Univer-
sity and growth in the state.
Much of the talk - held at the
Institute for Social Research
with about 30 people in atten-
dance - centered on invest-
ments for furthering innovation
and education at the forefront
of Michigan's economic revival,

and how the University can con-
tribute to that process.
"We know how to innovate
and teach the next generation of
innovators," Forrest said. "We
know how to partner with indus-
try and government to ensure
that our innovations are used
by others. We certainly know
how to start companies based on
inventions."
The University plans to
allocate $277 million in fed-
eral grants across three major
branches of research: social sci-
ence, medical science and engi-
neering, Forrest said.
The College of Engineering
has already received $50 to $60
million in grants, the ISR about
$50 million in-grants and the
Medical School $80 million in
grants, according to Forrest.
Dingell agreed with Forrest
that the University is finding
ways to make the most out of the
federal stimulus dollars.
As Dingell spoke, he pointed to
his head and said, "This is where
human greatness is preserved."
In addition to discussing the
University's role in further-
ing research and education, the
speakers, including James Jack-
son, director of the ISR, spoke
about how the grants will also

Vo i e Your aims to i
students, one knock at a time

Group members
will go door to door
in res. halls urging
students to vote
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Election Day is knocking on
the door, and soon, so too will
the members of Voice Your Vote.

Members of the organiza-
tion, which is a commission of
the Michigan Student Assem-
bly, will be going door to door in
residence halls starting Sept. 21
through Oct. 4, Michigan's voter
registration deadline for the
November elections.
Peter Logan, University Hous-
ing spokesman, said VYV is
approved to enter residence halls
at pre-arranged times, as has
been the case in previous elec-
tion cycles.

"Their purpose is solely for
encouraging students and assist-
ing students in registering to
vote," he said.
Students who don't want to
hear from VYV can put a "No
Soliciting" sign on their doors,
Logan said.
During the registration period
for the 2008 presidential elec-
tion, the non-partisan group's
access to the residence halls was
temporarily restricted when a
University Housing staff mem-

ber complained that represen-
tatives of the group were acting
improperly. The complaint was
resolved and the group was
allowed to return to the resi-
dence halls.
LSA senior Kate Brierty, co-
chair of the University's chapter
of Voice Your Vote, said because
the group isn't affiliated with a
political party and instead focus-
es on registration and voter edu-
cation, the group is well-received

Event organized by
H.E.A.D.S. discusses
black history at 'U'
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
"This is the most important
time of your life. You will devel-
op who you are for real now...
You will have to decide how to
define yourself for yourself for
the first time in your life."
These are the words of Grego-
ry Harden, keynote speaker and
founder of H.E.A.D.S. - a black
student orga-
nization that
stands for
Here Earn-
ing A Des-
tiny Through
Honesty,
Eagerness
and Determi- HARDEN
nation of Self.
Harden, who
also serves as associate athlet-
ic director for the University,
enlivened the crowd at the 9th
annual "Reflections in Black"
H.E.A.D.S. event at the Michi-
gan League. Harden's speech
encouraged students to live up
to their academic potential,
despite outside distractions.
The event, which featured
influential black leaders on
campus as well as performances

by the University of Michigan
Jazz Quartet, aimed to welcome
black students back to the Uni-
versity through inspiring ideas
of unity, intellectual growth and
reinforcing notions of progress
in equality.
The event opened with a word
from LSA senior and H.E.A.D.S.
chair James Stinson III, who
encouraged students to remain
focused on their studies as they
embark upon a potentially dif-
ficult year of school at the Uni-
versity.
"Being a Michigan student
is a challenging journey as you
learn and grow academically
and personally," Stinson said.
"But we know you are up to the
challenge."
College is a peak time for
growth and development as a
person, and students need to
be independent and learn for
themselves who they want to be,
Harden said.
Harden also encouraged
students at the event not to let
stereotypes and performed
judgments become excuses for
not living up to academic and
personal potential.
"It's too easy to provide an
excuse for not doing what you
came here to do," Harden said.
"If you're human then you will
be constantly attacked by fear
and self doubt."
He concluded by urging stu-
dents to free themselves from

past struggles in order to move
forward - likening these dif-
ficulties to modern day forms
of slavery - and to realize that
help is always available on cam-
pus if needed.
"If you can't let it go by your-
self, get help," Harden said. "But
let go of any chains around your
neck. Slavery is slavery, whether
you're talking about the 16th,
17th century or we're talking
about today."
John Lockard, adjunct lectur-
er of Afro-American and Afri-
can Studies and member of the
National Conference of Artists,
spoke next, echoing Harden's
sentiment and recognizing the
difficult history that blacks have
faced, while urging students to
continue to move forward.
"Tonight is a special evening
because we attempt to inspire
and recognize that there is a
history," Lockard said. "... this
attitude that has been handed
down for a couple centuries in
our country about being less
than human can really, really
destroy one's possibilities."
The event also featured two
informational videos about the
progress of African Americans
on campus, beginning with the
University's creation in 1817. It
discussed the significant devel-
opments made at the University
during the Civil Rights move-
ment, as students began to rally

Michigan Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm has ordered U.S. flags to be
flown at half-staff on Saturday in
remembrance of those who lost
their lives in the Sept. 11, 2001, ter-
rorist attacks.
Granholm also is encouraging
people in Michigan to observe
a moment of silence Saturday at
8:46 a.m., the time the first jet-
liner crashed into the north tower
at the World Trade Center in New
York.
Granholm says reflections on the
ninth anniversary of the attacks
will help "honor the memories of
the victims and heroes of that day
and keep their loved ones in our
thoughts and prayers."
. Granholm also is encouraging
people to observe the National Day
of Service and Remembrance. She
plans to volunteer at a Habitat for
Humanity event in East Lansing in
recognition of the Day of Service.

WASHINGTON
Election spending
sets records
Turns out politics, for all its
focus on the gloomy economy, is a
recession-proof industry.
This year's volatile election is
bursting with money, setting fund-
raising and spending records in a
high-stakes struggle for control of
Congress amid looser but still fuzzy
campaign finance rules.
Based on the latest financial
reports, House and Senate candi-
dates in this election cycle raised
nearly $1.2 billion, well ahead of the
pace for contests in 2008, 2006 and
2004.
Races for governor in 37 states
- more than half of those for open
seats - are also setting fundrais-
ing records. Billionaire Republi-
can Meg Whitman leads the way,

pumping $104 million of her own
money into her campaign for Cali-
forniagovernor.
"We may be on track for the
most expensive cycle ever, even
more than '08, which is really hard
to believe," said Michael Toner, a

Cave and a former Federal Election
Commission chairman.
MEXICO CITY
Mexican bill to
allow migrants to
file complaints
Mexico's Senate passed a bill
yesterday that would allow undoc-
umented migrants to file com-
plaints about abuses and receive
medical treatment without being
questioned about their immigra-
tion status.
Currently, Mexican law allows
only people who are legally in the
country to file such complaints
with police and other agencies, and
hospitals and other institutions are
permitted to ask people for proof of
legal migratory status.
The bill adopted on a 79-0 vote
in the Senate, already passed the
lower house of Congress and now
goes to President Felipe Calderon
for final consideration.
Last month's massacre of 72
mainly Central American migrants
by gunmen apparently linked to a
drug gang sparked calls to better
protect migrants from kidnapping
and abuse as they cross Mexico in a
bid to reach the United States.

By DEVON THORSBY
Daily News Editor
Former University Department of
Public Safety officer Charles Beatty
III plead guilty to cocaine pos-
session in the Washtenaw County
Court in frontof Judge Donald Shel-
ton, courtofficials confirmed.
Beatty, 42, was arrested in Ypsi-
lanti on the night of Jan. 13 for
cocaine possession and having an
open container of alcohol in his
vehicle at the time.
Beatty was off duty at the time of
his arrest.
Following his release, Beatty was
placed on unpaid administrative
leave from DPS, and his employ-
ment ended on Feb. 9 in an undis-
closed manner.
Prior to his arrest, Beatty was fol-
lowed by members of the Livingston
and Washtenaw Narcotics Enforce-
ment Team for about six weeks after
they received an anonymous tip and
consulted with DPS.
According to the police report,
Beatty's suspicious activity record-
ed by the officer following him the
night of Jan.13 led to his arrest.
Steve Hiller, Washtenaw County
chief deputy assistant prosecu-
tor, told AnnArbor.com that many
defendants who plead guilty to drug
charges like Beatty's as first-time
offenders are placed on probation.
Beatty's sentencing is scheduled
for Oct19 in front of Judge Shelton
at the Washtenaw County Trial
Court.

By STEPHANIE BERLIANT
Daily StaffReporter
Fresh from hearing her name
called five times at this year's
Emmy Awards, Temple Grandin
addressed a packed audience at
the Michigan Theater last night.
Grandin, a professor of ani-
mal science at Colorado State
University and top innovator
in the field of animal behavior,
spoke as the first in the Penny
Stamps Series of lectures spon-
sored by the School of Art &
Design. In the lecture called
"Autism, Animals and Art"
Grandin focused on how dif-
ferent types of thinking can be
used to advance society.
Though impressive by their
own merit, Grandin's accom-
plishments are magnified by
the fact that she was diagnosed
in childhood with a severe form
of autism, a neurological disor-
der that impairs social and com-
munication abilities. Grandin
couldn't talk until she was
four years old and doctors
advised her mother to institu-
tionalize her, but her mother
instead chose to seek intensive
treatment for Grandin.
As a result, Grandin became
one of a small minority of
autistic children born in the
1940s to greatly improve in
communication and today she
is considered high-function-
ing.
Grandin is known for put-
ting her unique viewpoints
into everything she does and
offering continuous examples
of the way she sees things dif-
ferently from most people.
Last night's event was no
exception.
In her distinct Kansas
accent, Grandin described the
doubts people had about her
methods at the start of her
career in the 1970s.

After watching cattle become
easily upset when walking
down shoots to be slaughtered,
Grandin walked through a cat-
tle shoot herself, and realized
that there were sensory distrac-
tions in the shoots like too much
or too little light.
"People said, 'Why would you
look at things the cattle's look-
ing at?"' Grandin said. "But get-
ting in their position was what
figured it out."
To a crowd of about 1,700,
Grandin described how autistic
people and animals think the
same way - one of the reasons
she was drawn to the field of
animal behavior. Autistic peo-
ple use "bottom-up" processing,
she said, in which they see the
details first and piece together
larger meanings from there.
Grandin related this bot-
tom-up processing to autistic
people's lack of understanding
of generalized situations. For

example, telling a child not to
run in the street outside his or
her home may not translate to a
school or park. An autistic child
might need to be told in each
situation until he or she under-
stands that running in streets,
in general, is not acceptable, she
explained.
Throughout the lecture,
Grandin emphasized focusing
on interesting things people
with intellectual disabilities
can do well. She urged parents
of autistic children to push
their children, whether put-
ting young children in at least
25 hours a week of intensive
therapy or encouraging older
children to develop their talents
- like when Grandin's mother
encouraged her to go to singing
camp, which Grandin protested
at the time.
"She told me, "You do have ,a
choice: you go for two weeks or
the whole summer,"' Grandin

said. "We must push these kids
or they won't develop."
Grandin's life was the inspi-
ration for an HBO film released
in 2010, which won five Emmys
in August. She described the
movie as "pretty accurate," not-
ing the producers took care to
correctly represent her life in
two hours.
After the event, Art & Design
senior Chris Momont said the
lecture allowed him to see a
window into a different type of
mind.
"Getting people together who
think in different ways, who use
pictures versus words, is how
we're going to move forward,"
Momont said.
Art & Design junior Dana
Pierfelice said she didn't know
what to expect from the lecture,
but she ended up finding it very
engaging.
"Her humor made everyone
so comfortable," she said.

D etroit has had its share of hard times, but a new agrarian
trend is bringing some hope to the city. An urban farm
has sprung up in a vacant lot in the middle of Detroit.
Though downtown farms may seem out of place, they are wel-
come additions to communities in which healthy food and job
prospects are few and far between. Urban farming has the
potential to improve the health of Detroit residents, strengthen
the city's economy and foster a more community-oriented envi-
ronment. Community members and Detroit officials should rec-
ognize these benefits and support the creation of urban farms
throughout the city.

We will stop printing The New York Times
sometime in the future, date TBD.'

on Wednesday, as reported yesterday by The Huffington Post.

The farm, located in a community not
far from Detroit's downtown area, produc-
es fresh fruits and vegetables for residents
to purchase. It was created by the organi-
zation Urban Farming, which was formed
in 2005. Urban Farming's headquarters is
in Detroit, according to a report by ABC's
Detroit affiliate WXYZ. The organiza-
tion's mission, according its website, is to
utilize Detroit's unused land to increase
Detroit residents' access to healthy food.
The company began in 2005 and is still
growing.
But even in its early stages, Urban Farm-
ing is already accomplishing many of its
goals. Artery-clogging fast food is often
the only cheap and easy meal option for
people living in low-income communities
in Detroit. Urban farms, however, provide
affordable and healthy food where there
was previously none. Because the pro-
duce at these farms is grown locally, shop-
pers can be sure of freshness and quality.
But more importantly, it's close and easy
to access. The combination of healthier
choices and convenient access to fresh
foods will help promote healthy habits
and a healthy lifestyle, resulting in long-
term health benefits for poverty-stricken
Detroit residents.
Detroit's crumbling economy needs a
makeover. And urban farms could be part

of a solution to the city's economic prob-
lems. The mass exodus from Detroit - a
result of the city's increasingly depressing
financial crisis - has left a lot of empty
space throughout the city. Utilizing this
vacant space to create urban farms will
generate new business opportunities in
areas that have been so long accustomed
to losing local businesses. Urban farming
also helps to improve the local job market
because these farms require a lot of man-
power to operate successfully.
In working to operate the farms, Detroit
residents are creating a sense of communi-
ty. Working at a local farm or shopping at
a local farmer's market is an easy way for
people to invest in their community. For
many Detroit residents, the farm could be
a spark of hope. And the city has been so
poverty-stricken for so long that this hope
goes a long way in revitalizing Detroit's
prospects.
Detroit can only benefit from the
increase of urban farms. Urban farms
encourage Detroit to make use of resourc-
es that are currently going to waste: land
and available labor. And the farm is a valu-
able source of healthy food and a sign of
hope for the community. City residents
and leaders should value the urban farm
and create similar farming projects to help
reinvent Detroit.

Hello! I'm glad you're taking
time out of your day to read
this rather than using it as
a napkin like most
students. Bless
your heart. Any-
hoo, it's another
year at the Univer-
sity of Michigan
and those of us at
the Daily are just
as excited as you 1
are. We'll get to
today's topic in a WILL
moment, but just GRUNDLER
how are you?
It's been a while,
hasn't it? Did you
have a nice summer? Get all your
books? Hey, good for you! Did you
decide on that major yet? Will you
still be going to model railroad club
on Tuesdays? Oh, you're president of
the model railroad club? My, my. It
does sound interesting. Anyway, is
there any inherent meaning to your
existence that gives you cause to con-
tinue living or are you just kidding
yourself?
Oh dear, don't look like that. Didn't
you know about the current theme
semester for the College of Litera-
ture, Science and the Arts? It's called
"What Makes Life Worth Living?"
and has already accounted for a
36-percent drop in Dentistry majors.
But don't worry if you don't know the
answers yet. Just yesterday I went to
the library and poured over Plato and
Aristotle and Hume and Nietzsche
and Confucius and Socrates and Kant
and Bob and Tom before asking a
nice old lady called Ethel what she
thought life was all about who stared
at me with intense seriousness before
answering, "I don't know. Butcan you
tell me how to make a Facebook?"
Well, to be honest, I didn't do all
of that. I made it up, actually. I just

want to stress that the meaning of
life has been debated for thousands
of years by bajillions of people much
smarter than you or me and we still
haven't really reached a definitive
answer. At the same time, we're faced
with the very real possibility that at
the end of our own lives, when we are
supposed to have figured out a few
things, the world will have changed
completely and we'll have to catch
up all over again. That's what the
whole Ethel thing was about - how
she couldn't operate computers. Did
you get it? No? Isn't "Ethel" a funny
name, though?
I don't mean to be cynical, really.
It's charming that the University is
trying to hold students' attention by
asking them the big questions. The
question. I'm sure there are some
students, like those in fraternities or
those considering careers in adver-
tising, that have never thought to ask
themselves such a question. I'm just a
little worried - us Daily columnists
are often worried about one thing or
another, it's a real burden - that the
University is getting a bit sensational
with the current theme semester.
I suppose my first objection to
"What Makes Life Worth Living?"
is the fact that the first event to kick
off such an ambitious intellectual
topic is a screening of "The Wizard
of Oz," tonight at 8 p.m. in the Keene
Auditorium of the Residential Col-
lege. Well, thank goodness. You might
want to show up at seven, just in case
it gets packed, and for heaven's sakes
pay attention this time! When you
watched it last you obviously missed
the scene in which the secret of life
is revealed. (It's the one with the fly-
ing monkeys, which is a statement on
evolution, I think.)
The events get better, to be fair.
(Check out wmlwl.com for all the
info.) There will be dance perfor-

mances and poetry readings and
lectures about the Peace Corps and
tours of the art museum, but in three
months you won't know much more
about life or what you want out of it
than you do now, I'm afraid. At least,
that's my guess. I imagine that takes
a little more than a semester, and
maybe more than a lifetime.
Why are you still
breathing? LSA
wants to know.
But I must applaud the University
for being a bit bolder compared to last
semester's theme of "The Joys - and
Sorrows - of Stamp Collecting." No,
I'm sorry, last semester was "Mean-
ingful Objects: Museums in the Acad-
emy," and it wasn't completely boring.
And I'll admit that this semester's
theme will probably catch more stu-
dents' attention. I'm just miffed that
there's so much subjectivity - and
perhaps meaningless - to the ques-
tion of what gives life meaning.
At any rate, you should make an
effort to attend some events this year.
The University is getting desperate
trying to attract your attention, and
if you don't show some interest next
semester's theme could very well
be "Let's Raise Your Tuition (More
Than Usual) and THEN See If You're
Interested, Hm?" And please -please
- if you know which scene of "The
Wizard of Oz" contains the meaning
of life, don't hesitate to e-mail me.

MICHAEL TENGEL I
Spark a passion to learn early

Representing the Block M

As a student in the University's School of
Education, it has become impossible for me
to avoid drowning in the perpetual news cov-
erage about school reform. Everyone seems
to have an answer to schools' problems. As a
20-year-old college junior, I'm not yet in a posi-
tion to exert my influence over matters that
large. What I do instead is look at the different
challenges and strategies of teaching kids.
Two of the most relevant examples are
the ways in which I spent my last two sum-
mers. The summer of 2009 was spent teaching
swimming lessons to 10- to 12-year-olds at an
upscale country club in the Cleveland suburbs.
This summer was spent at a Las Vegas basket-
ball academy training the kids of some of the
wealthiest people in the world. You may have
noticed the common thread by now. In both
situations, I was faced with children of (often
immeasurable) wealth.
A lot of energy and time is spent discussing
how to improve the poverty-stricken grade
schools of this country. But I saw firsthand that
some of the wealthiest people I have ever met
could use some serious reform as well.
In most cases, my basketball students had
been pampered and indulged into thinking that
their wish was everyone's command. In dealing
with kids like this, I was faced with a less-pub-
licized side of the education "problem." How
was I supposed to impart knowledge to children
who had been taught they were only required to
listen if they felt the message was worth their
time? Spending six months with children like
this taught me that there is really no ultimate
solution, but the strategy that worked best is one
that ties together all education.
The reform needed is something most stu-
dents could point out in a heartbeat. If I asked,
"Why was this teacher or this class so great?"
I would be willing to bet these answers would
be among those received, "The material was
so interesting," "The teacher made it so inter-
esting," or "The material was so relevant." I
learned to get these kids paying attention and
hanging on every word I said through the elu-

sive "passion" teachers always long to spark.
But it took some work and it took some unusual
sidetracks.
When I reflect on learning experiences that
stand out, I notice that many of these classes
or teachers sparked my interest by starting
with some activity that was tailored to my age
and interests. When students arrived to these
classes on the first day, we weren't greeted by
a stockpile of novels to be ingested and paper
assignments to begin. At the most basic level,
we were told why we should care about the
material and how we could integrate what
was being taught and what our everyday lives
entailed. The teachers made it clear that they
knew who we were as an age group and as
individuals and used that information in a con-
structive way.
Admittedly, this is a solution that is a bit too
complicated for grade schools or for the young
children I worked with, but the idea remains
the same. Sidestepping the X's and O's briefly
is an easy price to pay if it means children are
eager to learn what will come next. This sum-
mer in Vegas, I had to consider the everyday
life of these 12-year-old kids. What I discov-
ered is that by tapping into their interest in
NBA superstars and allowing them to start out
each day by practicing the "signature move" of
their favorite superstar, I could maintain their
attention all the way through the productive
drills that came next.
This is the malicious constant among all lev-
els of education: The tendency to see students
as a big, faceless obstacle or a task that needs
to be accomplished, devoid of personality or
interests. Whether the student is age 8 or 18,
poverty-stricken or unimaginably wealthy,
there is always a way to make the interests of
a student a part of the lesson plan. I would not
dare to suggest this is anywhere close to a solu-
tion to many of the problems plaguing educa-
tion, but on the small-scale that a 20-year-old
college junior looks at it, it is certainly a start.

ot many companies can
produce a single symbol
that becomes internation-
ally known and respected. Only elite
companies like
Nike and Apple
reach this status.
Here at the Uni-
versity, we have a 40
prestigious symbolj
that has certainly
reached a status
of international
recognition - the
Block M. This COURTNEY
simple stylized M FLETCHER
is more than just
a letter. If you put
on the Block M,
you are representing not only your-
self, but also the University. Putting
on a Block M is more than saying
"Go Blue!" It has a past that must be
respected, a present that needs to be
taken advantage of and a future that
will only go as far as we take it.
If you have heard the new athletic
director, David Brandon, speak in
the past six months, you have almost
certainly heard him speak about the
Block Mas a brand for the University.
The advantage of branding is that
a symbol can be an instant identi-
fier for a company. But it goes further
than that. Branding also comes with
expectations, values and responsi-
bilities - all of which are associated
with the Block M.
There are enormous expecta-
tions associated with the Block M.
Michigan is expected to be the best
in athletics, academics, community
involvement, research and facilities
- basically everything. Upholding
all of these expectations is difficult,
but the University seems to do it year

after year. Academically, the Univer-
sity has almost always been a among
the best in the nation - often ranking
in the top 20 or 30.
The athletic standard here at
Michigan is also unmatched. If a
team is not ranked in the top ten,
winning Big Ten championships or
winning national championships, it
is considered a disappointing season
- the football team's recent seasons
are a prime example of this.
The University's facilities are also
ahead of the rest. The newest residence
hall, North Quad, gives a unique liv-
ing and learning experience. The most
notable facility on campus is Michi-
gan Stadium. Now that all of the new
renovations have been completed, the
Big House is once again the largest sta-
dium in the U.S. and the third largest
in the world. And if an expectation is
not being met, the University is always
pursuingideas to improve the facilities.
Former Athletic Director Bill Martin
was particularly known for this.
To an extent, all students at the
University know and feel these
expectations. But as a student-ath-
lete - I'm a member of the Univer-
sity's varsity volleyball team - these
expectations are amplified. The stan-
dards listed above are in the forefront
of all players', coaches' and adminis-
trators' minds. With each new sea-
son, the past year is erased. The only
focus is to improve.
Instead of just being a part of the
University, we are in the spotlight
representing it. Week in and week
out, athletes put on a jersey and go to
battle with other teams all for the glory
for Michigan and to prove that we are
the best. "The Victors" isn't just a song
we sing in victory, but also a battle cry
before the competition begins. The vol-

leyball team sings ourfight song before
each match as loudly as possible so that
The Block M
means more than
just "Go Blue"
everyone knows that Michigan is there
and we are readyto win.
The theme "Win for Michigan" is
something that every athlete is aware
of. Weunderstand that winning isn't to
bring ourselves glory, but to give glory
to Michigan. Think about the football
team. The pressure for these young
men to perform isn't because everyone
knows them and wants to see them do
well as individuals. It's because the
Block M represents the winningist
football program in the country and
that is what is expected.
Most University students have the
opportunity to make a mark on the
Block M in their own small way every
day. But on a weekly basis, student-
athletes have an opportunity to do
so on a national stage. Former head
football coach Lloyd Carr addressed
the current student-athletes on Tues-
day and made the statement "You
are Michigan." Past players have had
their time to make their mark, and
now it is our turn. As student-athletes
consider their upcoming seasons, we
are all focused on one thing, to repre-
sent the Block M in a positive way and
to Win for Michigan.

Pastor reconsiders holding Quran burning

Rev. Terry Jones
says he agreed to
meet imam backing
ground-zero mosque
GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - An
anti-Islamic preacher backed off
and then threatened to reconsider
burning the Quran on the anni-
versary of the 9/11 attacks, angrily
accusing a Muslim leader of lying
to him Thursday with a promise to
move an Islamic center and mosque
away from New York's ground zero.
The imam planning the center
denied there was ever such a deal.
The Rev. Terry Jones generated
an international firestorm with his
plan to burn the Quran on Satur-
day, the ninth anniversary of the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,
and he has been under intense
pressure to give it up. President

"The University of Michigan
is the largest employer in Ann
Arbor, and a pillar of the local
economy," Jackson said. "Grants
awarded to the University result
in direct and indirect benefits
for the southeastern Michigan
region."
The ISR will use a portion of
the funds - a majority of which
comes from the National Insti-
tutes of Health - to expand their
facilities through the addition of
a four-story wing to their current
building on Thompson Street.
The new facilities will
enhance both research capac-
ity and productivity, help train
future generations of researchers
and make possible the integra-
tion of research across programs,
Jackson explained. For exam-
ple, social science and biomedi-
cal theory may be combined to
incorporate genetic testing in
research.
The new addition is expected
to create 100 new construction
jobs and 92 new jobs for research-
ers, programmers, interviewers
and administrative staff, Jackson
said.

learn a lot about the history of
African-Americans at the Univer-

Barack Obama urged him to lis-
ten to "those better angels" and
give up his "stunt," saying it would
endanger U.S. troops and give
Islamic terrorists a recruiting tool.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates
took the extraordinary step of call-
ing Jones personally.
Standing outside his 50-mem-
ber Pentecostal church, the
Dove Outreach Center, alongside
Imam Muhammad Musri, the
president of the Islamic Society
of Central Florida, Jones said
he relented when Musri assured
him that the New York mosque
will be moved.
Musri, however, said after the
news conference that the agree-
ment was only for him and Jones
to travel to New York and meet
Saturday with the imam oversee-
ing plans to build a mosque near
ground zero.
Hours later, Jones said Musri
"clearly, clearly lied tous."

"Given what we are now hear-
ing, we are forced to rethink our
decision," Jones said. "So as of
right now, we are not canceling the
event, but we are suspending it."
Jones did not say whether the
Quran burning could still be held
Saturday, but he said he expect-
ed Musri to keep his word and
expected "the imam in New York
to back up one of his own men."
Jones had never invoked the
mosque controversy as a reason
for his planned protest. He cited
his belief that the Quran is evil
because it espouses something
other than biblical truth and
incites radical, violent behavior
among Muslims.
But he said Thursday afternoon
that he prayed about the decision
and concluded that if the mosque
was moved, it would be a sign from
God to call off the Quran burning.
"We are, of course, now against
any other group burning Qurans,"

Jones said. "We would right now
ask no one to burn Qurans. We are
absolutely strong on that. It is not
the time to do it."
Musri thanked Jones and his
church members "for making the
decision today to defuse the situ-
ation and bring to a positive end
what has become the world over a
spectacle that no one would bene-
fit from except extremists and ter-
rorists" who would use it to recruit
future radicals.
After Jones accused him of lying,
Musri said the pastor "stretched my
words" at the press conference.
"I think there was no confusion
to begin with. When we stepped
out of the church, we had an agree-
ment to meet in New York," Musri
said. He added that Jones "said his
main reason for stopping the event
was that it would endanger the
troops overseas, Americans travel-
ing abroad and others around the
world."

Federal judge ,
rules that don't
ask don't tell
policy is illegal

Judge Virginia
Phillips says policy
violates the rights of
gays and lesbians
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A feder-
al judge on Thursday declared the
U.S. military's ban on openly gay
service members unconstitutional
and said she will issue an order to
stop the government from enforc-
ing the "don't ask, don't tell" policy
nationwide.
U.S. District Judge Virginia
Phillips said the ban violates the
First and Fifth Amendment rights
of gays and lesbians. "Don't ask,
don't tell" prohibits the military
from asking about the sexual ori-
entation of service members but
requires discharge of those who
acknowledge being gay or are dis-
covered engaging in homosexual
activity, even in the privacy of
their own homes off base.
In her ruling, Phillips said the
policy doesn't help military readi-
ness and instead has a "direct and
deleterious effect" on the armed
services.
The Log Cabin Republicans,
a 19,000-member group that
includes current and former mili-
tary members, filed a lawsuit in
2004 seeking an injunction to
stop the ban's enforcement. Phil-
lips will draft the injunction with
input from the group within a
week, and the federal government
will have a week to respond.
Government lawyers said the
judge lacked the authority to issue
a nationwide injunction.
After-hours e-mails requesting
commentfromU.S. Departmentof
Justice attorneyPaul G.Freeborne
and from the Pentagon were not
immediately returned Thursday.
The lawsuit was the biggest
legal test of the law in recent years
and came amid promises by Presi-
dent Barack Obama that he will
work to repeal the policy.
The LogCabin Republicanssaid
more than 13,500 service mem-
bers have been fired since 1994.
"This decision will change the
lives of many individuals who
only wanted to serve their country

bravely," said the group's attorney,
Dan Woods.
Woods argued during the non-
jury trial that the policy violates
gay military members' rights to
free speech, open association and
right to due process as guaranteed
by the Fifth Amendment.
He said the ban damages the
military by forcing it to reject tal-
ented people as the country strug-@
gles to find recruits in the midst
of a war. Lawyers also submitted
remarks by Obama stating "don't
ask, don't tell" weakens national
security.
Freeborne had argued the pol-
icy debate was political and that
the issue should be decided by
Congress rather than in court.
In his closing arguments he said
the plaintiffs were trying to force a
federal court to overstep its bounds
and halt the policy as it is being
debated by federal lawmakers.
The U.S. House voted in May to
repeal the policy, and the Senate is
expected to address the issue this
year.
That makes the trial unneces-
sary, and the testimony and docu-
mentary evidence presented by
the Log Cabin Republicans irrel-
evant, Freeborne said.
"We do not believe the court
has the authority to issuea nation-
wide injunction," he said.
Government attorneys pre-
sented only the policy's legislative
history in their defense and no
witnesses or other evidence.
Six military officers who were
discharged under the policy testi-
fiedduringthetrial.AdecoratedAir
Force officer testified that he was let
go after his peers snooped through
his personal e-mail in Iraq.
The officers who participated
in the trial were "reacting emo-
tionally because they're so proud
that they were able to play a part
in making this happen," Woods
said after the ruling.
"It'll be an interesting deci-
sion for our president to decide
whether to appeal this case.
He's said that 'don't ask, don't
tell' weakens national secu-
rity, and now it's been declared
unconstitutional," he said. "If he
does appeal, we're going to fight
like heck."

. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) talks about federal funding for research at the Institute for Social Research yesterday.

Pulmonary Diagnostic Services
and professor of internal medi-
cine at the Medical School, said
that part of the Medical School's
grant will be used to study pul-
monary fibrosis, a fatal lung
condition for which the cause is
unknown.
The funds will be used to carry
out a longitudinal study of the
disease components of pulmonary
fibrosis and to build a network
across eight other U.S. medical
and research institutions, Marti-
oity through last night's event.
"I didn't really know about the
history of black people on cam-
pus and I thought that was really
interesting," Beebe said. "I didn't
know it was that hard back then."
LSA sophomore Michael Wil-
liams said he found Harden's
speech to be inspiring.
"I thought he was really reach-

nez said. Not only will this create
jobs, but it will also act as a model
for future research for other dis-
eases, he said.
The College of Engineering
plans to utilize the grants by
offering four additional graduate
and six additional undergraduate
classes throughout the Universi-
ty's three campuses in addition to
new laboratories, said Huei Peng,
professor of mechanical engi-
neering at the University.
Many of the grants will be
ing out to college students, espe-
cially black minorities, people of
color, (and) just telling them to
reach their highest potential, to
take advantage and be as produc-
tive as we can be," Williams said.
Stinson said that he hopes
events like this will foster unity
in the black community - and in
turn the University community

invested in the development
of electric vehicles, including
hybrid technology, green ener-
gy manufacturing and the use
of renewable energy in vehicle
infrastructures, he said.
Officials from the College of
Engineering will also use the
stimulus funds to create sum-
mer camp programs that aim to
attract high school students to
the field of engineering so they
can continue to carry Michigan's
auto industry forward, Peng said.
as a whole - by teaching through
example how the University itself
has overcome racial barriers over
the years.
"We can keep changing, we
can become a better institution,"
Stinson said. "And through that,
through better and stronger com-
munities, it builds a better Uni-
versity."

How bowling and
White Russians
represent a lost era
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
Sometimes, there's a man for
his time and place. And that's The
Dude. Sometimes, well, there's a
movie for a time
and place. And
that's "The Big The Big
Lebowski." When Lebowsid
the film was first

critics deemed it $6
the worst of the
Coen Brothers' movies and said it
would soon be forgotten - which
is a perfectly understandable reac-
tion. Face it. It's a really weird
movie about a pothead named Jef-
fery "The Dude" Lebowski who
gets mistaken for a millionaire with

the same name. obviously, this ends
in The Dude's rug getting peed on.
Since the rug really tied the room
together and that sort of aggression
will not stand, The Dude investi-
gates and encounters a host of mem-
orable characters.
While the quirks of the cast do
help "Lebowski" withstand the test
of time, I'd argue there's more to it
than that. With the cult following
the film has, there must be. The
film really means something to the
masses of fans who attend midnight
screenings and do some hardcore
bowling.White Russians have never
been so popular and bathrobes have
never been so stylish.
In order to understand the
attraction and significance of the
film, "The Big Lebowski" must be
understood as a quintessentially
American movie. It takes place
against the backdrop of the Gulf
War, which was arguably partially
fought as an attempt to heal the
wounds years after Vietnam - to
reconstruct a new identity of a vic-
torious nation. "The Big Lebowski"

struggles to reconstruct the iden-
tity of the American populous after
Vietnam.
Rather than forging a completely
new identity, "The Big Lebowski"
creates one out of tired icons from
America's past. The movie is noth-
ing ifnot nostalgic. The favorite pas-
time of The Dude and his cohorts is
bowling, a relic of the idyllic '50s
and '60s. The Dude has a picture
of a bowling President Nixon in his
living room, a relic of a less cynical
America. "The Big Lebowski" takes
place in Los Angeles, which was, for
many years, the exalted final fron-
tier of manifest destiny. The nar-
rator is a cowboy - Hollywood's
traditional, masculine hero.
In this case, however, the cow-
boy is not the hero of this film. He
seems to be lost and hollow, as do
many of the film's elements. The
bowling alley is kind of sketchy. The
Los Angeles portrayed in the film is
not "The City of Angels" but rather
a collection of characters from the
underground, ranging from juvenile

explores the re-emergence of "art
books" in the face of a declining
publishing industry.
"At this moment when the
industry at large is really strug-
gling, artists and ... independent
groups or presses seem like they
(are) starting to experiment and
do some interesting new things,"
said Jacob Proctor, associate
curator of modern and contempo-
rary art at UMMA and co-orga-
nizer of the symposium. Those
new innovations he described
include "experimental design and
new experimental ideas about dis-
tribution."
Proctor and Elizabeth Sears,
fellow organizer and professor
of history of art, collaborated to
focus on this wide-ranging topic
in the visual arts. The "art book"
is not solely a resource for artists,
but includes other printed pub-
lications like museum catalogs
and academic books. While print
publications get fewer and-farther
between, the art book is undergo-
ing a reemergence as an item that
cannot be so easily digitized, they
said.

This guarded aesthetic on Pt. 2
thwarts the careful blend of emo-

as danceable but not as deep, and
that's a loss.
But the change also allows
for hard-hitting twin highlights
"Criminal Intent" - a slick and
sexy speech over blips, bloops and
siren wails - and the irrepressible
travel monologue "U Should Know

paced calling-out of nationalities
that should know better than to
fuck with her is nearly ruined by
Snoop Dogg's most timely observa-
tion that there's a black president
in our White House (thanks for the
update, Snoop).
But sloppy guest spots aside,
these tracks have confidence bust-
ing out their ears, and the general
in-your-face-ness of Body Talk, Pt.

ously, any rising international
superstar has to keep the teary-

maybe Robyn's gritty new shell is a
good sign - here's hoping she'll be

LEBOWSKI
From Page 7
delinquents to porn directors.
The Dude's friend Walter is a neo-
conservative Vietnam veteran who
is by no means an exemplary citi-
zen. Jesus is a pederast in a purple
jumpsuit. The Dude's time is one in
which nothing is sacred.
And nothing in that time
deserved to be treated as sacred.
Any character who's supposed to
mean something - to have done
something for America -is exposed
as a phony and a failure. Lebowski
the millionaire didn't really make
his own millions. The Dude himself
was a hippie who wanted to make
change and spent his college years
occupying various administra-
tion buildings. One of the German
Nihilists cuts off her toe for a mil-
lion dollars. Between the Vietnam
years and the world of Lebowski,
something in America was lost. A
tradition was broken and it became
easier to abide than to act.
It's easier not to act because
no one wants to be exposed as a
phony and a failure, and that fear of
exposure drives "Lebowski." As a
who-done-it film investigating the
darker side of an American nature,
"The Big Lebowski" falls into the
tradition of a film noir. Noirs were
often channels of fear during the
Depression and World War II years
in American cinema. Yet "The Big
Lebowski" was released at a time
when there seemed to be little to
fear. In fact, the whole film mocks
the idea of fear - the bad guys are
just nihilists. Even death is a bit of

a farce as Donny's ashes are placed
in a Folger's coffee can and dumped
somewhat anticlimactically into
the Pacific Ocean. But maybe that's
the point. Maybe there's a reason
why a ridiculous noir like "The Big
Lebowski" still resonates today.
Perhaps there is something to fear
and worry about if we are living in
a society where everything is com-
pletely devoid of meaning.
I find the irreverence and in
some sense, anger, of "The Big Leb-
owski" tobe perfectly justified and
part of why it's so popular. For one
thing, the Dude's time and our time
are remarkablysimilar.Granted, it's
only been about twenty years but
we're engaging new enemies in the
Middle East in wars that are hard to
make a whole lot of sense outof. The
war in Iraq has often been titled the
next Vietnam. But the thing is, none
of it is about Vietnam (as much as
Walter would like to believe it is) -
not bowling and not even that war

in the Middle East.
The Dude is the man for his time.
He's not a hero exactly, but he does
make people realize that no coun-
try and no people can construct
an identity if each generation is
growing up under the shadow of
the kitschy stars of a romanticized
bowling alley. But the movie does
construct an identity and a sense of
a community because it teaches us
to laugh at the mistakes of the past.
After all, the human comedy does
keep perpetuating itself.
The Coen Brothers are trying to
analyze the direction the human
comedy has taken in the years since
the Vietnam War and what they
have to say in their film doesn't
seem to be entirely pleasant or
hopeful. But in a time where noth-
ing is as itseems, corruption is to be
expected, and cynicism is the norm,
the best thing to do is probably just
to abide and know the dude is out
there, taking it easy.

Breakdown: Robinson
will be X-factor vs. ND

Irish aerial attack could
pose problems for Blue

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
After a record-setting performance
against Connecticut last week in a 30-10
victory, all eyes are on sophomore quarter-
back Denard Robinson.
And against the Fighting Irish this
week, Robinson's first start on the road, the
speedy quarterback will be keyed on early
and often, leaving the rest of the Michigan
offense to pick up some slack.
Safe to say, it should get interesting in
South Bend.
MICHIGAN RUN OFFENSE VS.
NOTRE DAME RUN DEFENSE:
With 197 yards on the ground from the
quarterback position, the Wolverines look
like one of the strongest rush offenses in
the country at the moment.
The Irish run defense is definitely better
than Connecticut's, though, boasting line-
backer Mante Te'o, who should be playing
on Sundays soon. Te'o's job on Saturday
will be to stop Robinson in his tracks. But
Robinson should be one of the fastest run-
ners Te'o and the rest of the Irish see all
season.
Rodriguez should also be able to use
junior Mike Shaw and sophomore Vincent
Smith more effectively against the Irish
than theydid last week against Connecticut,
since much of Notre Dame's rush defense
will be focused on stopping Robinson.
EDGE: Michigan
MICHIGAN PASS OFFENSE VS.
NOTRE DAME PASS DEFENSE
Purdue passed 42 times on the Irish last
weekend, completing 31, but Boilermaker
signal caller Robert Marve also threw two
interceptions. Whether that's a reflection
of the Notre Dame secondary remains to be
seen.
The Wolverines will most likely get top
wideout Roy Roundtree for this game, as
the injury report says he's probable for Sat-
urday's matchup. Roundtree's presence in
the slot could be a huge coup for Michigan,
despite the fact that he was a non-factor
last week. If he plays like he's expected
to, that won't be the case as Robinson will
definitely be in situations that require him
to throw more often.
It's hard to judge the Michigan pass
game on last week's win, considering the
Huskies spent most of the game waiting for
Robinson to burst into the open field. But
he did make some huge throws under pres-
sure, so expect to see the same sort of thing
this week, just more frequently.
EDGE: Michigan
NOTRE DAME RUSH OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN RUSH DEFENSE
Rodriguez said earlier this week that
he's just as concerned about the Irish's
two-headed rushing machine as he is about
their talented aerial attack.
Armando Allen and Cierre Wood com-
bined for 151 rush yards last week and
both are pretty electrifying in space. They
should force the Wolverines' defense to
focus on good tackling again this week.
The rush defense against Connecticut
was mediocre at best with the Michigan
linebackers disappearing for long periods
of time, allowing Jordan Todman to rack
up a respectable 109 yards.
The Notre Dame offensive line is still
extremely young, which Michigan could
take advantage of, but the Wolverines still
have a long way to go in this category. With

two quality running backs probably getting
into space, the Irish should take the cake in
this category - but not by that much.
EDGE: Notre Dame
NOTRE DAME PASS OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN PASS DEFENSE
This is where it could get ugly for the
Wolverines.
Dayne Crist is a young quarterback, but
he showed a lot of poise in the pocket last
week against Purdue. The huge advantage
for the Irish, however, is in Crist's arsenal.
Michael Floyd and Kyle Rudolph, a possible
All-American tandem at wideout and tight
end, will give the young Michigan second-
ary huge fits this weekend.
J.T. Floyd will go head-to-head with
Notre Dame's Michael, who should be
Floyd's most difficult matchup of the year.
Here's betting it doesn't go well.
Rudolph, a definite NFL prospect,
should also give the Wolverine lineback-
ers a lot of trouble, as he provides matchup
problems for nearly every team he plays
against. Seniors Obi Ezeh and Jonas Mou-
ton will most likely be given the task of
matching up with Rudolph, and if they can
slow him down, it will say a lot about their
development.
EDGE: Notre Dame
SPECIAL TEAMS
After last weekend's special teams
were a wash due to the weather, the game
in South Bend should be a good gauge of
where this team stands.
Brendan Gibbons should rebound from
his performance last weekend, but it would
be a mistake to overlook the Notre Dame
crowd, which could be one of the loudest
the Wolverines see this season. The Irish's
kicker David Ruffer, on the other hand,
knocked three through the uprights last
week. Advantage: Notre Dame.
Jeremy Gallon should also bounce back
from his fumble on a poorly planned punt
return, and Rodriguez insists he should
still be as electric as advertised. But with
an inexperienced group on special teams
in a hostile environment where a game-
winning field goal may be needed, it's usu-
ally safe to say the edge goes to the home
team.
EDGE: Notre Dame
INTANGIBLES
As always, there willibe tempers flying in
South Bend for this rivalry matchup. And
after the last time Michigan came to Notre
Dame, with torrential downpours and a
whole host of fumbles, the Wolverines will
be eager to prove themselves.
That's not even mentioning last year's
amazing, Tate Forcier-led comeback in
which Greg Mathews caught the game-
winner to end an incredible drive. That
game may have changed the course of
Notre Dame's season, and they sure do
remember it.
So with both teams in very similar posi-
tions as far as the rivalry goes, home field
advantage could be a big decider in this
matchup. That is, if the weather doesn't act
up again.
Robinson is the X-factor here, and if he
can overcome the noise on the field, the
other intangibles won't matter. He will.
EDGE: Michigan
FINAL SCORE:
Michigan31, Notre Dame 30

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily SportsEditor
What a difference a week makes.
Seven days ago, Michigan fans didn't
even know who was going to start at
quarterback.
Now, fans know the Michigan at
Wolverine they have
under center, and it's Notre Dame
no secret that he's one Matchup:
of the most explosive Michigan 1-0;
players in the country. Notre Dame 1-0

son, has undoubtedly Where: Notre
been the focus of the Dame Stadium
Irish gameplan this TV/Radio:
week. But Notre Dame NBC
offers a challenge to
the Michigan defense
that could be just as potent as Shoelace.
Notre Dame junior receiver Michael
Floyd is one of the premier wideouts in
the country and terrorized Michigan's
secondary last year. He tallied seven
catches for 131 yards and a touchdown,
before going down with an injury that
derailed his season.
Containing him this year won't be any
easier.
"It's going to be a huge challenge,"
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez said
during a teleconference on Wednesday.
"He's so dangerous, particularly on those
deep balls. He's got the size and ability to
go up and get those, even when he's cov-
ered. That's what he did against us last
year and he's done it against everybody
he's played against, really."
Floyd presents a significant test in the
passing game, but the Irish running game
is arguably even more dangerous.
Notre Dame boasts a loaded backfield,
with senior Armando Allen, who got the
majority of the carries during the game
against Purdue last weekend. He shared
snaps with talented sophomore Cierre
Wood, who didn't play his freshman year
but wasone of the nation's top running
back recruits out of high school.

FILE PHOTO/Dai
Notre Dame senior wideout Michael Floyd (pictured here) was injured against Michigan last year.

"Who's got us concerned are the run-
ning backs," Rodriguez said. "They are
very elusive and very quick but run with
a lot of power."
For the first time in a few years, the
Wolverines will go into their game
against Notre Dame with a much more
confident situation at quarterback than
the Irish. Notre Dame signal-caller
Dayne Crist saw his first significantgame
action on Saturday and is playing on a
surgically-repaired knee. Still, he looked
solid in his starting debut, completing 19
of 26 passes for 205 yards and a touch-
down.
The matchups on the field will be fun
to watch, but it will be the matchup on the
sidelines could be even more interesting.
First-year Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly
has followed a very similar path to the
pinnacle of college football coaching as
Rodriguez. Both started as head coaches
of small schools, both are spread offense
pioneers, and both now find themselves
at the very top of their professions.
"He had great success at Grand Valley
(State University) and everywhere he's

been," Rodriguez said. "And I've been
fortunate enough to have started the
same way. Sometimes when you're at the
smaller level you have to be more creative
... Now we're both at great institutions
that have great tradition, great fan fol-
lowing and great interest."
Kelly runs a pass-oriented spread,
while the Rodriguez spread is more run-
oriented.
Both coaches used to coach in the
Big East and did play against each other
once - Rodriguez's West Virginia team
beat Kelly's Cincinnati Bearcats 28-23 in
2007.
"I've kind of followed his path, so to
speak, what he's done in the last couple
years," Rodriguez said. "And I've got a
lot of respect for his ability to coach and
build a program."
INJURY NOTES: While redshirt
sophomore wide receiver Roy Roundtree
is listed as probable, freshman spur
Carvin Johnson will be out tomorrow
with a sprained knee. Redshirt junior
wide receiver Junior Hemingway is list-
ed as doubtful.

Around the Big Ten: Pryor to be tested in week two

By ALEX HERMANN
Daily Sports Writer
When ESPN's Todd McShay gets on
Sportscenter to talk about Ohio State
quarterback Terrelle Pryor's improved
throwing mechanics and virtual trans-
formation into a traditional "drop-
back" quarterback, you shouldn't buy
tl -hype.
One tremendous game against Ore-
gon in the Rose Bowl last January com-
bined with a strong performance against
Marshall in the team's opener is hardly
enough evidence to project Pryor as a
first-day talent in the NFL at anything
but wideout.
That said, the second-ranked Buckeyes
are the Big Ten frontrunner for a reason.
And even though Pryor may never devel-
op into an adequate next-level signal call-
er, he certainly has all the right physical
tools to lead a team as talented as Ohio
State to another conference champion-
ship.
Pryor's next big test? No. 12 Miami, a
program undergoing a renaissance of its
own.
I don't know what's more likely - the
Hurricanes' return as an elite program

in the next half decade or Pryor's shot at
being a weekly starter in the NFL.
But one thing is for certain - ESPN's
hype of this particular matchup is far
from overblown.
NO.18 PENN STATE (1-0) AT NO.1
ALABAMA (1-0)
It's hard to justify No. 18 Penn State's
lofty ranking with true freshman Rob-
ert Bolden at quarterback. And unfortu-
nately for the Nittany Lions, the schedule
affords little time to break in their young
gun as they head to Tuscaloosa to play
top-ranked Alabama.
But the Crimson Tide have a handi-
cap of their own in the backfield, with
Heisman Trophy-winning tailback Mark
Ingram out of the lineup on Saturday, giv-
ing Penn State fans some hope of acquir-
ing a win in SEC country.
And take it from someone who would
like nothing more than to see Alabama
coach Nick Saban in the fetal position
on the sidelines, sucking his thumb and
sobbing after Joe Pa's team unexpectedly
puts a whipping on his boys.

Unfortunately for us in the valiant
minority, it's not going to happen.
MICHIGAN STATE (1-0) VS.
FLORIDA ATLANTIC (1-0)
Someone, somewhere screwed the
pooch on this one.
First off, who decided to have this
game at Ford Field in Detroit?
Second, whose idea was it to charge
ridiculously high prices?
Michigan State, a middling program in
the conference, isn't in a position to give
up a home game to play Florida Atlantic.
I can't believe many seniors in East Lan-
sing are happy about giving up one of
their precious football Saturdays.
Ford Field has sold just 25,000 tick-
ets as of yesterday, causing local radio
personality and journalist Terry Foster
to call the game an "embarrassment" to
Michigan State on his blog.
Not that I'm inclined to agree with
Foster often, and especially on matters
involving college football, but we cer-
tainly agree here, and the biggest losers
are the Spartan students.

Southeast Michigan.
Thieu said she decided to
expand into Ann Arbor because
she thinks the city is a "great mar-
ket to go into."
"I like the college town, I like
the locals and the boutiques,"
Thieu said.
She also said students will
benefit from her store because it
offers a variety of styles and fash-
ions.
"I think a boutique that can
cater to all is unique and I think
that'll help us to stand out a little
bit," Thieu said.
Pink Pump isn't the only new
store to hit East Liberty Street.
This & That, a locally-owned
candy shop, opened about seven
weeks ago. Andrea Graef, the
owner of the store said she decid-
ed to open in Ann Arbor because
it offers a mix "between students,

local people and tourists."
"I wanted a little bit of every-
thing," she said.
The store offers more than 300
different kinds of candies and
other sweet items, according to
Graef. This variety will be espe-
cially appealing to students, she
said.
"I think they like it because
they can come in and buy as much
or as little as they like," Graef said.
In the upcoming months, Graef
said she is planning to introduce
online ordering, event catering
and even delivery to places like
the library during exam time.
But locally-owned businesses
are not the only ones flocking to
Ann Arbor, as chains are making
their way to the city as well.
@burger, owned by Big Boy
Restaurants, opened on East Lib-
erty Street about a month ago,
said Dave Crawford, senior vice-
president of marketing for @
burger, a "fast-casual" restaurant
serving burgers.

"Fast-casual burger is where
all of the energy is right now," he
said.
Crawford said there were
multiple factors that went into
choosing Ann Arbor as a loca-
tion, including the city's good
economic situation, the presence
of the University and Ann Arbor
culture.
@burger has a relaxed atmo-
sphere where students can come
unwind, Crawford said.
"You can kind of come in and
hang out," he said. "The seating is
built for comfort."
In the future students may also
be able to choose the restaurant's
music, and even have their iPods
play over the speakers, according
to Crawford.
Other new businesses like CVS/
pharmacy and Five Guys Burgers.
and Fries are opening on State
Street in the near future as well.
Inquiries sent to CVS Pharmacy
from The Michigan Daily went
unreturned.
