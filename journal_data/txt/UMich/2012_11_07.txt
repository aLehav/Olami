A roaring cheer, emanating from
the Diag, echoed throughout Central
Campus Tuesday night as students

gathered to celebrate the re-election of
President Barack Obama.
Four years into a battered presi-
dency, the thunderous outcry was a
sigh of relief for many Obama support-
ers whose hopes for the future were
pinned to the president's precariously
narrow electoral success.
Across campus and partisan divides,
students gathered in groups large and
small to watch the returns from Tues-

Proposal 1, on
EFM law, too close
to call as of 4 a.m.
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
Despite losing the presiden-
cy, Michigan Republicans still
have something to be happy
about: five out of six statewide
ballot proposals that Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder and
other GOP leaders campaigned
against were defeated.
Michigan voters were split
on Proposal 1, a referendum on
the state's emergency finan-
cial manager law, but the other
proposals concerning union-
ization, alternative energy, tax
rights, and a new bridge to Can-
ada were all soundly defeated.

director for social media, said

Michigalnli,* y on Tuesday
night, Snyder said he wasn't
opposed to the idea of requir-
ing renewable energy, but said
it was inappropriate for such
a measure to be placed in the
state's constitution.
"I think the concept of hav-
ing a new renewable goal that's

good goal and that's something
I think should take place ... you
(also) should be talking about
energy efficiency and that
should be part of the discussion

Michigan voters also defeat-
ed Proposal 4, which would
have amended the Michigan
Constitution to give home
health care workers the right
to unionize under the Michi-
gan Quality Home Care Coun-
cil and declare them public
employees. Voters turned down
the amendment 58 percent
against to 42 percent in agree-
ment. The Home Care Council
was established under previ-
ous Democratic Michigan Gov-
ernor Jennifer Granholm but
was defunded by Republicans
after Snyder's took office. The
amendment aimed to re-estab-
lish the council and ordered
them to create minimum stan-
dards for home health care
workers.
Heaney said a moderate
voter might view the proposals
as too vague and too broad and
that they could have succeeded
if they were more focused.
"The reason they lost on two,
three and four was just because
the proposals seemed to be
overly broad and over reach-
ing," Heaney said.
Voters also stopped Proposal
5 that would've amended the
state Constitution to require
a two-thirds majority vote of
the state Legislature to pass
any tax increase into law. The
proposal failed 69 percent to 31
percent and it faced bipartisan
opposition.
The controversial Proposal 6
was also soundly defeated by a
margin of 60 percent to 40 per-
cent. The proposal called for an
amendment requiring all new
international bridges or tun-
nels to be approved by a state
referendum.
The proposal was almost
solely funded by Matty
Moroun, who owns the
Ambassador Bridge between
the Detroit and Canada. The
proposal was widely criticized
by both parties and Snyder and
seen as a way for Moroun to
maintain his monopoly over
commercial traffic between
the countries.
Michigan Attorney Gen-
eral Bill Schuette said Michi-
gan voters made it clear that
altering the state constitution
should not be taken lightly.
"The message is don't
mess with our constitution,"
Schuette said. "There were...
good reasons to say two
through six shouldn't succeed,"
Snyder said.

Secretary of State
yet to report full
election results

By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
As of 3:15 Wednesday morn-
ing, the election for the Uni-
versity of Michigan's Board of
Regents is too close to call in a
tight race between Republican
candidates Dan Horning and
Robert Steele and Democratic
candidates Mark Bernstein and
Shauna Ryder Diggs. The Michi-
gan Secretary of State's website
lacked returns from the densely
populated counties in Metro
Detroit while many rural and
northern counties had totals sub-
mitted.
In the returns that were avail-
able, Horning garnered 321,638
-votes and Steele earned 319,840
Votes. Bernstein and Diggs
trailed with 257,336 and 230,286
votes, respectively. However,
these figures did not include
Washtenaw county or Detroit's
Wayne county, which are likely
to be strongholds for the Demo-
crats.
Horning previously served as
a regent between 1995 and 2002
before losing his re-election bid
in the face of high Democratic
a

turnout for Democratic Gover-
nor Jennifer Granholm. Horning
is currently a managing director
at Northwestern Mutual, a finan-
cial services agency.
In his renewed campaign,
Horning focused his campaign
around limiting the number of
out-of-state and international
students as well as lowering
tuition rates.
"The biggest challenge today,
for me, is striking the balance
between in-state and out-of-
state (students): engaging proper
tuition for the out-of-state and
international students and find-
ing more access for the in-state
students," Horning said in an
Oct. 29 interview. "I think in-
state students are paying too
much, and I don't think out-
of-state students are paying
enough."
Robert Steele, who holds a
bachelor's degree and medical
degree from the University, is
currently a practicing physician
and a former University profes-
sor of medicine. Steele is running
on a similar platform of limit-
ing the number of out-of-state
students and refocusing on the
University's commitment as a
Michigan public institution. He
also called for mandatory cours-
es for undergraduates about the
US constitution and economic
history.

"My suggestion is that if you
have to take four semesters of
a foreign language, then you
should have to take two semes-
ters of the language of Ameri-
can freedom which includes one
semester on the founding docu-
ments," Steele said in an Oct. 29
interview. "And then you have a
semester on some general eco-
nomic studies ... about the role
of free enterprise and free mar-
kets."
Speaking Tuesday at a Repub-
lican rally in Lansing, Steele
downplayed his chances in light
of Obama's victory in Michigan.
"It would have to be super
super close - if Obama wins by
just a shade I would have a very
small chance." Steele said.
On the Democratic side, Bern-
stein holds a bachelor's degree, a
law degree and business degree
from the University of Michigan
and is the president of the Sam
Bernstein Law Firm, his father's
legal practice. He previously
worked in the White House in
the Clinton administration and
he was appointed by Granholm
to sit on the Michigan Civil
Rights Commission.
During his comparably well-
publicized campaign, Bern-

for lower tuition for under-

FROM THE DAILY
Second chances
Obama should push for more innovative policies
President Barack Obama won a decisive victory Tuesday night
to serve a second term as President of the United States. This
week, The Michigan Daily endorsed the President with hesi-
tation that was common nationwide, citing his success in foreign pol-
icy and pushing a progressive agenda in the face of an unreasonable
Congress. Obama has earned a second term - but winning elections
is only a small part of politics. Obama must take advantage of the next
four years. The president needs to take a stronger stand in the face of
Congress and continue to push more innovative policies.


What makes America exceptional are the
bonds that hold together the most diverse
nation on earth."
- President Barack Obama said during his victory speech Tuesday night in Chicago.

More than instant gratification

a

By and large, Obama was the stronger
candidate. The country is incredibly divided
on party lines. Because of this division, the
president was unable to enact the sweeping
changes he promised upon election in 2008.
The President did not win over conservative
voters in the election by being more moder-
ate, and the same rules apply in Congress.
In his victory speech on Tuesday night,
Obama touched on progressive ideas he
hasn't mentioned as much in his campaign
like climate change, immigration and mar-
raige equality. This is the second time
Obama has promised to bring real change
to Washington - hopefully, this time he
delivers.
In order for the President to make a real
difference as a policymaker, he must improve
negotiations and stand up to opposition from
congressional Republicans. This is not to
suggest he goes the route of political brink-
manship, but Obama has too often come to
the bargaining table too close to the middle
and folded too quickly.
Now that Obama has secured a second
term in the White House, he must push
for broader intervention in key issues. The
economy should be his primary concern. In
2009, the Obama administration backed the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,
a $787-billion stimulus package that creat-
ed between 1.4 million and 3.3 million jobs.
Obama and Congress should allow the Bush
Tax Cuts to expire, and propose legislation

to lower the middle-class tax rate. While
these are positive interventions, the Obama
administration needs to take a stronger step
in reinvigorating the economy. The President
should advocate a second stimulus package
during his next four years in office.
In his first term, Obama took steps to
improve education and broaden opportu-
nities for students. However, many of his
attempts to expand access to education fell
short of his progressive promises. During
his first term, the Obama administration
increased funding to the Pell Grant program,
which provides financial aid to students from
low-income families. However, the expan-
sion of these grants came at the expense of
lowering subsidies for the Stafford Loan pro-
gram for graduate students.
In June 2012, Obama issued an executive
order to forbid the federal government from
initiating the deportation of illegal immi-
grants who met specific requirements. While
undocumented students benefit under this
order, they have to apply again for U.S. resi-
dency every two years.
Obama has the latitude as a second-term
president to make the next four years more
fruitful than his first. Much of his success
will be dependent on his interactions with
Congress, which has been largely deadlocked
for the past four years. Obama should expect
plenty of difficulty - and we need to support
his agenda by staying involved in politics
post-Election Day.

Allow me to preface this article
by saying that I'm the absolute worst
person in the world to have a horse
in any race.
Whether it's sports, politics or
a county fair chili cook-off, the
"impassioned observer" has never
really been a role that I've been
able to take on. This isn't to say
that I'm just another Little League
dad who's heckling the umpire the
entire time, though. .
In a lot of ways, I'm the consum-
mate Michigan fan: I don't believe
that any victory is secured until
the very last second, I'm constantly
underselling my team and, in the
event of a close contest, my stom-
ach is busy performing an Olympic
gymnastics routine. So yes, despite
the fact that it was 11:40 p.m., and
numerous major news outlets pro-
jected President Barack Obama
passing 270 electoral votes, I still
couldn't help but be a little wor-
ried. This is, after all, my first rodeo
in terms of presidential elections.
Surely something, anything, could
happen to reverse this victory.
Maybe New Jersey's last-second
voters would swoop in and steal the
state away from the President. Per-
haps the remaining eight percent of
Florida will swing toward Romney.
I know that it sounds ridiculous, but
this doesn't feel right.
Is it wrong for me to be a little
skeptical given how tense I've been
feeling the last few days? All the

weight we held on our shoulders -
the concern that our guy, whether
it was the president or Republican
presidential candidate Mitt Rom-
ney, wasn't going to pull it out-was
wiped away in a matter of minutes.
As early as 8:45 p.m. this evening, I
sat in the Union's University Club
where aroomful ofbuzzingstudents
eagerly awaitedthe results, and all of
us, whether internally or externally,
were nervous wrecks. Electoral vic-
tories projected by CNN elicited just
as many groans as they did cheers.
Eventually, as I exited this bee-
hive, the race began to take a more
substantial shape. Just before 11
p.m., Romney led Obama by one
electoral vote. Watching the pro-
ceedings from the comfort of a
friend's sofa, I went upstairs to
grab a glass of water, came back
down and, suddenly, Obama had
253 votes. A few minutes after that,
CNN called Obama the winner.
Say again?
I, and the other fellow Demo-
crats with whom I was digesting
this information, sat in stunned
silence. Even around midnight
there was still an air of uneasi-
ness with the result. Where were
the hugs and raucous celebrations?
Why weren't we running into the
streets, ripping off our clothes and
proclaiming victory for an America
where Paul Ryan doesn't control its
collective uterus?
Of course, the payoff could

never quite equal what it took to
get there. On Tuesday morning,
technical difficulties and a line out
to Main Street had me waiting for
nearly two and a half hours before
I could finally cast my vote. It was
never in question whether or not I
was going to fill out my ballot, but
the amount of time that went into
the whole ordeal certainly deep-
ened my attachment to the result.
As children, we blindly follow the
allegiances of our parents when
we watch an election. This time
around, it was my voice that was
being counted, and I'll be damned
if I said that didn't mean something
to me.
So yes, maybe I expected a little
too much in terms of how we'd
all react. Far be it from me to say
that life can be more than a little
anti-climactic at times. But it's
not always about receiving that
instant gratification that so many
of us crave in these monumental
moments. In the case of an election
as pivotal as this, it's about being
able to wake up tomorrow, and the
next day, and every one after that
for the next four years and feel gen-
uinely optimistic about the country
that you love. To my Republican
friends - who couldn't be reached
for comment, by the way - I assure
you, you'll get your chance. For now,
though, my horse won by a nose.

CAPS is here to help

These four - sometimes five - under-
graduate years at college are supposed
tobethebestofour life. Movies, televi-
sion shows and crazy sto-
ries from our parents are
constant reminders ofthe
fun we should be having,
the friends we should be
making and the once-in-
a-lifetime experiences
we'd be crazy to miss
out on. Unfortunately, a MARY
large number of Univer- GALLAGHER
sity of Michigan students
find themselves unable
to take advantage of these unique opportuni-
ties. For many of these students, mental health
problems are a significantobstacle in their path
to a happy university career.
Most freshmen arrive during Welcome
Week and are suddenly cut off from the sup-
port system they've spent much of their lives
establishing in their hometowns. Before,
their parents, old friends and high school
coaches and teachers looked out for their
best interests. Now, after they have unpacked
their bags and gone over their favorite color
and type of food with their new roommate,
they have to build that entire support system
up again.
Usually, the signs that a student may be
having a problem are lost in the initial excite-
ment of the first couple months of college. But
by this point in the year, many students have
settled into their new lifestyles, built them-
selves a niche in a new friend group, found a
student organization to get involved with and
pulled themselves through their first set of
midterms. When everyone around seems to
suddenly have it all figured out, it can make it
even more obvious that everything isn't going
entirely as planned. Sometimes, it takes being
removed from the comforts of your home set-
ting to realize that all those gnawing anxi-
eties have morphed into something bigger,
something uglier.
I had a similar experience around this time
freshman year. I'd been dealing with various
degrees of sadness and hopelessness for years,
but being in a place that was supposed to be
the setting for the happiest times of my life
was a real wake-up call to the fact that I had
not been living my life the way I wanted to
be. That was when I pulled a little blue stress

football out from the depths of my dorm desk
and called the number written on the side.
That's how I ended up at the University's
Counseling and Psychological Services. I felt
uncomfortable there at first, almost guilty, as
though it was a space intended only for people
with what I thought of as "real" problems. I
thought that my array of suburban white girl
stresses hardly qualified me for outside help,
and I almost expected the counselor assigned
to me to roll her eyes as I spoke about my life.
We need to stop
stigmatizing mental
health treatment.
Of course, she didn't. What I didn't under-
stand was the fact that just because a problem
is only in your head doesn't mean that it's not
real or doesn'tneed attention. The counseling
services offer assistance to students with any
number of issues - from day-to-day stress
to relationship counseling to severe disor-
ders. That's why they offer a wide variety of
counseling options, from the standard one-
on-one treatment to weekly group counsel-
ing with like-minded peers, to daily meetings
that offer a no-pressure overview of common
concerns encountered by Michigan students.
CAPS also provides urgent and crisis services
for patients who must be seen that day and
referral services for those seeking long-term
treatment elsewhere.
There continues to be stigma toward getting
treatment for mental health problems. Some
people worry that if they do, they'll be seen as
weak, or as cryingout for attention. I know that
was one of my concerns. But I can honestly say
that going to CAPS has improved my college
experience more than I could have ever imag-
ined by opening me up to new opportunities
and a healthier way of viewing the world. Don't
let the stress of college get you down - those at

t seemed like it might go on
forever, but the 2012 election
finally came to an end Tues-
day night. We've
learned a lot
during this elec-
tion cycle, but,
perhaps the most
striking lesson
was the painful
lack of unity and
inspiration in MICHAEL
our country. SPAETH
This presi-
dential cam-
paign was largely fought within
the margin of error, representing
a bitterly divided electorate. This
time around, there was no "hope"
and "change." Crowds at Presi-
dent Barack Obama's rallies were
smaller than in 2008. The New
York Times reported on Sunday
that Obama attracted a crowd of
"24,000 here in Bristow, [Va.] com-
pared with 60,000 and 80,000 in
his final days in 2008."
This campaign ultimately was
about small ideas. Neither candi-
date stood in the blistering summer
heat or the chilly autumn breeze to
declare that we will build an inter-
state highway system to connect the
nation or put a man on the moon.
Compared to these bold goals that
were met decades ago, "I'm going
to fix the economy" is a bit of a let-
down. The 2012 campaign was
about cleaning up the nation's prob-
lems, not lifting it up with inspira-
tion and grand ambition.
Where are the big ideas that will
bring the country together?
Some have observed that big
ideas in general are in short supply
right now. Neal Gabler, a senior fel-
low at the Annenberg Norman Lear
Center at the University of South-
ern California, wrote in 2011, "In
effect, we are living in an increas-
ingly post-idea world - a world in
which big, thought-provoking ideas
that can't instantly be monetized
are of so little intrinsic value that

fewer people are generating them
and fewer outlets are disseminating
them, the Internet notwithstand-
ing. Bold ideas are almost passe."
The lack of bold ideas extends
to politics as well. After the 2010
midterm elections, Timothy Egan
wrote in the Times, "One of the
mystifying paradoxes of Obama is
how this gifted writer, this eloquent
communicator, has not been able to
come up with a simple, overarch-
ing governing frame." Egan listed
Teddy Roosevelt's Square Deal,
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and
John F. Kennedy's New Frontier as
big ideas that provided clear narra-
tives for their presidencies.
Everyone in America should be
directly involved in the develop-
ment of a new big idea. Citizens
should make suggestions while
intellectuals and experts design a
specific policy that helps the econ-
omy with as few flaws as possible.
The president clearly explains the
benefits of the big ideas and uses
inspirational language to motivate
people to get involved. Businesses,
organizations and ordinary citizens
directly contribute their unique
talents to developing the big idea.
Social media promotes the ben-
efits of big idea and engages more
citizens. News organizations cover
the latest developments. Previously
uninvolved people watch the news
or check social media and decide
to get involved. When everybody
has a role to play, everybody feeds
off the involvement and the process
becomes self-sustaining.
The key ingredient is direct
citizen involvement. During tough
economic times, people want to
feel like they have something valu-
able to contribute - particularly
people who have been unemployed
for. a while. Instead of feeling
helpless and at the mercy of Con-
gress's decisions, ordinary citizens
should have the power to use their
own skills to personally improve
the economy. This empowerment

would inspire people and raise the
public's approval for the big idea,
which would silence many politi-
cians who would criticize it. Unlike
the abstract ideas of "hope" and
"change," people can stay united
around a tangible idea with clear
benefits backed up by effective pol-
icy. This allows citizens to directly
contributetheir own hard work.
People need more
than just the
ideas of 'hope'
and 'change.'

a

a

The big idea could be renewed
space exploration, where experts
conduct the missions, the presi-
dent gives inspirational speeches
and citizens raise money and edu-
cate their peers. The big idea could
resemble the Works Progress
Administration during the recov-
ery from the Great Depression,
where unskilled and unemployed
workers rebuilt the economy with
their own two hands. But we can do
even better than these two ideas.
With the innovative spirit of the
21st century, and the increasingly
advanced tools at our disposal, we
have the potential to dream up and
implement some truly extraordi-
nary and inspiring new ideas in the
present era.
Sensible, small ideas are logical
solutions for a stubbornly divided
nation. But the addition of a big
idea to the incremental progress
we're already making would not
only jump-start our economy - it
would also rekindle our national
pride, inspire us and unite us at a
time when we desperately need it.

Driskell ousts Ouimet
to take Mich. 52nd

Democrats secure
all Washtenaw
County state
Rep. seats
By CHANNING ROBINSON
Daily StaffReporter
Washtenaw County lost its
last Republican representative
on Tuesday, when Gretchen
Driskell, the former mayor of
Saline, defeated state Rep. Mark
Ouimet (R-Scio Township) in
the race to represent Michigan's
52nd District in the state House
of Representatives.
Driskell earned 52.6 percent
of the vote, defeating Ouimet
by more than 3,000 votes. She
claimed victory after 73 percent
of votes had been reported, at
which point she led by just 253
votes.

Driskell praised her support-
ers at a watch party at Weber's
Inn in Ann Arbor.
"We're here to thank all the
supporters that have been help-
ing us to where we are right
now," Driskell said. "We are in
a good -position. Obviously it's
early in the race and we have
hopeful expectations, but most
importantly, we want to thank
the people that are still here
because it could possibly be a
very late night.
Driskell commended cam-
paign volunteers for helping her
publicize the highly contested
campaign.
"I've been so impressed by the
incredible response that we've
had in the district by so many
people," Driskell said. "Every
single poll we went to there was
somebody standing there with
a Driskell sign - freezing - but
they were there with a smile on
their face."

Following her speech, enthu-
siastic guests chanted "Gretch-
en."
Ouimet spent election night
at the Ann Arbor Country Club
with Republican supporters,
who spent much of the evening
watching televisions tuned to
Fox News coverage of election
returns in the presidential elec-
tion.
He said his campaign for
re-election was focused on
informing voters of the progress
Michigan has made in the last
two years. He added that the
county experienced business
growth and saw Ouhet's cam-
paign goals accomplished.
"It was an interesting elec-
tion," he said. "We executed our
game plan and we started and
mapped something out every
day that we needed to accom-
plish and we accomplished all of,
our objectives and now we just
wait and see."

Congressman Dingell speaks to supporters in Taylor, Mich. on Tuesday Nov.6.
Dingell wins historic
30th U.S. House term

Dean of the House
wins by a wide
margin over GOP
challenger
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
TAYLOR, Mich. - Members of
the United Auto Workers cheered
out in jubilation as results of the
national election flashed across
a screen, indicating a historic
win for U.S. Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.), the longest-serving
member of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives.
At the event, 86-year-old Ding-
ell claimed a victory over Repub-
lican candidate Cynthia Kallgren
in the state's newly drawn 12th
district - which includes parts of
Ann Arbor, Taylor and Dearborn
- with a 75 percent lead with 79
percent of precincts reported as of
2:35 a.m. Wednesday.
In an address to the UAW
workers, Dingell said the crowd
reflected a diverse group of peo-
ple that he hoped the election
would allow himself and fellow
Democratsto continueto fightfor.
"(We're here) because we
believein somethingthat's impor-
tant," Dingell said at the event.
"We care about the future, and
that's what this election is about,
about seeing through it that our
kids get a decent education, that
they get health care. About seeing
through it that they can expect to
live just a little better than their
parents did."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, Dingell said the -
Democrats ran a stronger cam-
paign this year than during the
midterm election in 2010, and
their efforts show in the election
results.
"Frankly, the Republicans out-
spent us (in 2010), quite frankly
they out-lied us, and quite frankly
they won at a time when things
were bad." Dingell said. "Folks
didn't realize that it was their
handling of the economy and
their governing of the country
that made things such a mess,
and we didn't get out and reflect
that thought to people. This time

we did abetter job of getting our
story out and the people respond-
ed."
Dingell said he will continue to
pursue bipartisan policies in Con-
gress, noting his former success
among both parties on legislation
regarding food safety, pharma-
ceutical protection, and oil and
gas drilling regulation.
"If I can get the ideologues on
that side to retreat just a little,
we're going to try to see to it that
we do things that are necessary
to implement the health care bill,
to implement a lot of other legis-
lation that is necessary," Dingell
said.
He said that while Obama's
groundbreaking status as the
first African-American president
is indicative of the vast advance-
ments toward racial tolerance in
the nation since he first took office
in 1955, more must be done.
"The country has matured,
we're much wiser," Dingell said.
"That doesn't tell me though,
from some of the things that I've
heard, that we have yet ridden
all of the racial evils from this
nation, butI do see that first of all
the country is prepared to accept
a minority president, and that's
good."
He added that Obama is wor-
thy of his re-election because of
his achievements in helping save
the auto industry, wofkingto end
the War in Iraq, killing Osama
bin Laden and passing health
care reform.
"The harsh fact of the matter
is that we've made huge progress.
It is also a fact that the president
has had a good program, a fine
record of accomplishments,"
Dingell said.
While Dingell visited Taylor,
Kallgren met with supporters
and awaited results atlan Old Fire
House owned by the Downriver
and Detroit Business Association
in Wyandotte, Mich.
Laughter filled the room as
volunteers and campaign enthu-
siasts noshed on a dinner of pizza
and lasagna while waiting to see
if their efforts paid off.
Kallgren said that despite the
outcome, she was proud of her
campaign's efforts.
"I think this is the calm after

the storm," Kallgren said. "Now
I can go back to being a human
being again for the moment and
just enjoy the people who so lov-
ingly gave their time and efforts
knocking on doors and making
phone calls."
Kyle Kulik, a volunteer for the
Kallgren campaign, said he origi-
nally joined the campaign after
being asked by a friend to help,
but was also drawn to the candi-
date because of her anti-abortion
ideology.
"It was really a great experi-
ence because it helped me learn
more about what was going on
during this election," Kulik said.
Kulik said he most enjoyed-
door-to-door canvassing because
it made him feel closer to Kall-
gren and the community.
"I don't know how many
people actually meet and are
able to talk with those who they
might elect to office," Kulik said.
"That's something very impor-
tant, to have a relationship with
that person."
Kallgren said her campaign
has been an uphill battle from
the start, especially as a self-pro-
claimed housewife and regular
citizen who decided to run for
Congress against an entrenched
incumbent.
"Before the primary, we
couldn't even find a paper that
would announce that I was run-
ning," Kallgren said.
She said she's not sure if she
will run again in the future,
and is looking forward to see-
ing the final distribution of votes
between the counties.
Kallgren acknowledged that
Dingell is likely nearing retire-
ment age, and is unsure about the
fate of his seat in Congress.
"(It's) pretty disturbing when
you think we fought so hard to
get away from a monarchy in
England and how we have a seat
where there's an assumption that
you can just pass that title down
to a family member," Kallgren
said. "That's just not the Ameri-
can way."

percent of the vote
BySAM GRINGLAS

Incumbent State Rep. Jeff

can challenger John Spisak in

Michigan's 52nd district.
Irwin had 81 percent of the

Republican challenger John
Spisak received 18.11 percent.
In a victory speech to a
crowd of about 100 Democratic
supporters at the Washtenaw
County Democrats watch party
at the Weber Inn in Ann Arbor,
Irwin said he looks forward to
fighting for social issues in the

state.
"I'm really excited to go
back up there and keep fight-
ing for education funding,
protecting clean air and clean
water, and fighting for equal
rights for all of our citizens no
matter who they love," Irwin
said. "We have a lot of work
here to do here in Lansing
and a lot of work to do here in
Michigan."

Supereme Court candidates
in tight battle for two seats

Service will provide
* primary care to
community
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Though the contests are
still too close to call, the Michi-
gan Supreme Court is expected
to maintain a 4-3 conservative
majority.
The Republican-backed incum-
bent Brian Zahra is projected to

defeat his liberal opponent Shelia
Johnson. He led by nine points
with 87 percent of precincts
reporting. The winner wouldserve
on the bench until Jan. 1,2015.
Four candidates were vying
for two eight-year appointments
to the Supreme Court. Conserva-
tive incumbent Stephen Mark-
man was in a tight battle with
his Democratically supported
challengers, University Law Prof.
Bridget McCormack and Connie
Kelley, as well as Oakland County
Circuit Judge Colleen O'Brien, all
of whom were within mere per-

centage points of one another as of
early Wednesday morning.
Despite the close numbers,
McCormack said she believed her
hard work would lead her to vic-
tory.
"I received 10 out of 10 news-
paper endorsements and really
worked hard to develop relation-
ships around the state to make
sure people understood that I
was committed to having a court
where politics didn't play a role
and everyone got a fair shake and
I think my message resonated,"
McCormack said.

Warpehoski wins in
contested 5th ward

Kailasapathy,
Peterson also newly
elected to City
Council
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA AND
JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporters
In the only contested election
for a seat on the Ann Arbor City
Council, Democratic candidate
Chuck Warpehoski defeated
Republican candidate Stuart
Berry for a seat in the city's
fifth ward.
With 73 percent of pre-
cincts reporting as of 2 a.m.
Wednesday, Warpehoski held
a 83 percent lead over Berry.
Warpehoski will replace cur-
rent Councilmember Carsten
Hohnke, who did not seek re-
election, and will nownjoin Sumi
Kailasapathy (D-Ward 1) and
Sally Hart Petersen (D-Ward
2), who both ran in unopposed
contests, as the three new coun-
cilmembers on the 10-person
council.

Incumbents Margie Teall (D-
Ward 4) and Christopher Taylor
(D-Ward 3) were also re-elected
in uncontested elections.
At a Democratic watch party
at Weber Inn in Ann Arbor,
Warpehoski said he was confi-
dent coming into the election,
particularly as Ward 5 is a heav-
ily Democratic-leaning district.
He noted he spent most of elec-
tion season campaigning for
his Democratic counterparts
instead of himself.
Once in office, Warpehoski
said his primary goal as a coun-
cilmember is to not be tied to any
single piece of policy, but rather
serve as a responsive represen-
tative committed to facilitat-
ing dialogue between members
of local government and Ann
Arbor residents.
"If I'm not listening to people,
people should be disappointed,
that's number one," he said.
"People deserve responsive gov-
ernment."
Maintaining security and
safety, infrastructure and parks
are some of the "nuts and bolts"
issues that Warpehoski said he
expects to face in his term. He

added that like Hieftje, he will
strive to improve public trans-
portation in Ann Arbor.
"I ran on transit," he said.
"I'm a big transit supporter."
Warpehoski said though
many citizens are in support of
increasing transit, funding and
implementation of the transpor-
tation programs can be a divi-
sive issue among residents and
government officials.
"I haven't heard anybody say
they're anti-transit, only anti-
specific programs," Warpehoski
said. "I'm going to do everything
I can for transit."
The first step, he said, is
determining a consensus among
local governments, Ann Arbor
government officials and resi-
dents on the issue.
While he said he is eager to
start his position on the council,
Warpehoski said the hard work
isn't over yet.
"When I entered this race, I
didn't think I knew how hard it
was going to be to campaign and
get elected. Now that I'melected
I recognize I still have a lot to
learn to be effective as a mem-
ber," he said.

Mayor to focus
on fiscal issues in
coming term
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-
tje has been re-elected to his
seventh-consecutive term in
office.
With 71 percent of pre-
cincts reporting as of 1:30 a.m.
Wednesday, Hieftje led his
challenger, independent candi-
date Albert Howard, 84.1 per-
cent to 15.2 percent.
Hieftje attended a Democrat-
ic watch party at Weber Grill in
Ann Arbor where a few hun-
dred supporters, candidates
and politicians filtered in and
out of a packed hall plastered
with campaign posters. U.S.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann

Arbor) and several Ann Arbor
City Council- members were
among those in attendance.
In an interview at the event,
Hieftje said he hopes to contin-
ue his current policies into the
next term. He added he plans to
work with the Ann Arbor City
Council to maintain the city's
economic health and continue
to advocate for environmental
issues.
"The biggest motivation has
been (that) I wanted to make
sure the city gets through the
great recession without a tax.
increase," Hieftje said.
Another key issue he plans on
focusing on is improving pub-
lic transit within the city and
county. At recent Ann Arbor
City Council meetings, Hieftje
has pushed for city funds for
public transit projects, includ-
ing a second rail station that he
said would provide the clean
public transportation needed
for a burgeoning workforce.

"With a growing number of
jobs in the city - about 68,000
people come to work in Ann
Arbor from outside of town -
we're seeing more and more
congestion," Hieftje said.
He said he wasn't very emo-
tional following reports of
election results, but just that
he was "eager get to back." He
did, however, note the special
challenges, especially fiscal dif-
ficulties, that will face city gov-
ernment in his next term.
"I probably should have been
the mayor in the 1990s because
there was a whole lot of money
in government back then that
isn't there anymore," he said.
In an interview at How-
ard's watch party in a com-
munity building located on
Williamsburg Drive, Howard
said despite his loss, he felt
honored to receive 15 percent of
the vote. He added that Hieftje
should be more interactive with
the Ann Arbor community.
"He needs to be more cau-
tious and he needs to be more
transparent," Howard said.
"Just to be more considerate to
people and not taking them for
granted."
Howard, who began his
political career when he ran in
the 2008 presidential election,
said that though he had previ-
ously competed on the national
stage, campaigning locally was
more difficult.
"This was more challenging
because it was on home turf,"
Howard said. "A lot of people

OBAMA
From Page 1A
yet to come," Obama said.
Obama's re-election - com-
ing after a campaign season in
which the two candidates paved
distinct choices for the country's
future - seemed to signify that
despite waning support, the elec-
torate still believes in the vision of
change the president first laid out
four years ago.
However, his victory was not
as decisive as the historic 2008
presidential election. In the final
month following the Oct. 3 presi-
dential debate, Obama faced a
nationwide surge by Romney
and tightening poll numbers that
threatened his hold on crucial
swing states and his prospects for
a coveted second term.
As of 4 a.m., Obama holds 303
Electoral College votes to Rom-
ney's 206 according to the Associ-
ated Press, a margin significantly
lower than his 385-173 victory
over Senator John McCain (R-
Ariz.) in 2008. However, the
REACT
From Page 1A
and Obama's re-election became
more assured, impromptu cel-
ebrations and fits of dejection
became more common as liberals
rejoiced and conservatives faced
the imminent reality of another
four years of the Democratic
president. ,
Excitement reached a fever
pitch after 11 p.m., after most
major television networks called
S the election in favor of Obama.
Spontaneously, hundreds of stu-
dents began to gather on the Diag
to celebrate the election, reminis-
cent of a similar outpouring after
the 2008 election.
LSA freshman Sam Whaley,
an Obama supporter, said he
quickly made his way to the Diag
after hearing reports on CNN
that Obama would be re-elected.
He used the words "happy" and
"relieved" to describe the atmo-
sphere in the Diag, where the
crowd was rapidly growing.
"Everybody just wanted to be
together and be excited," Whal-
ey said. "So we all rushed to the
Diag because it's like the heart of
Central Campus. It has been a lot
of cheering and excitement and
some fight songs - "Hail to the
Victors," patriotic songs, a little
bit of everything. Just a lot of hap-
piness."
Another reveler, LSA freshman
Conner Wood, rushed to the Diag
to join his peers in what he called
a "magnificentvictory."
"It's very community," Wood
said. "People are very excited
about it, to the point where they're
doing handstands and dancing.
I've hugged many strangers. It's
just been a great, great euphoric
moment. I mean, we came so close
to disaster."
Regan Moro, a freshman in
the School of Music, Theatre and
Dance, said she was elated by the
election results, noting she is a
supporter of Obama's policies on

popular vote remains close, with
Obama holding a slim lead of just
50 percent to 48 percent.
Despite the challenges, Obama
clinched the electoral votes of
swing states like Ohio and Vir-
ginia, both of which projected
narrow margins throughout the
evening after the polls closed. He
also won early victories in Penn-
sylvania and Michigan, two states
that Romney singled out as late
annexations to his electoral map,
before Wisconsin, Nevada and
Iowa also went blue.
In his concession speech from
Boston early Wednesday morn-
ing, Romney told the crowd to put
aside partisanship, as he stood
before a banner bearing the words
"A Believe in America"
"The nation, as you know, is at
a critical point," Romney said. "At
a time like this, we cai't risk par-
tisan bickering and political pos-
turing. Our leaders have to reach
across the aisle to do the people's
work."
Romney's defeat represented a
sharp loss for Republicans, who
touted the election as an opportu-
social issues and came to the Diag
to celebrate with other students
who share similar views.
"I didn't think that Romney
would win, but I was a little bit
nervous about it because I know
the last four years haven't been
the easiest," Moro said. "I think
we're all brought to the Diagfor a
sense of community. I really feel
a part of the University of Michi-
gan community."
At a small gathering of about
a dozen members of the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Demo-
crats early in the evening, LSA
senior Lauren Coffman, the
communications director of the
group, said she believes Obama
resonates for many young people
around the nation.
"I think that (Obama) really
embodies the American dream,"
LSA junior Lauren Coffman,
communications director for
the College Democrats, said. "I
mean, he came from a single par-
ent household, from a family that
didn't necessarily have a lot of
money, and he has inspired the
country through his speeches
and through his story."
Speaking at the Michigan
Democratic Party's election
center in Detroit, LSA junior
Alexandra Brill, chair of the Uni-
versity's College Democrats, said
she was proud of the work that
the group had done leading up to
Election Day.
"We worked really hard both
with the top of the ticket and
with local candidates that were
victorious," Brill said in an inter-
view.
At a muted affair early in the
evening, about 30 members of
the University's College Repub-
licans gathered at the Michigan
Union to watch election analysis
and early returns from the first-
reporting states. Though many
members remained optimistic
for a Mitt Romney victory, some
quietly conceding the race was a
long shot for the former Massa-
chusetts governor.

nity to reverse the direction of the
country over the last four years
and to restore American values.
"I ran for office because I'm
concerned about America,"
Romney said. "This election is
over, but our principles endure. I
believe that the principles upon
which this nation was founded
are the only sure guide to a resur-
gent economy and to renewed
greatness."
The defeat for Romney was
especially bitter for some in Mich-
igan, as the candidate is a native
of Bloomfield Hills and the son of
former governor George Romney,
who served from 1963 to 1969.
Early returns in the state, after
Oakland County became the first
county to report its results, were
promising for Romny. But strong
turnout among younger voters
and minority voters and Obama's
support for the auto bailout gave
him an edge in the state, where
he ultimately won by 5 percent
according to the Associated Press.
The call marked the sixth con-
secutive presidential election
in which Michigan went Demo-
Speaking only when the first
returns began coming in, LSA
junior Kaitlin Mikatarian, the
secretaryofCollege Republicans,
said though she wasn't optimis-
tic about Romney's chances, she
hadn't given up hope.
By 8 p.m., the group had dis-
banded and members had gone to
watch the election results indi-
vidually or in smaller groups.
After networks called the
election for Obama, LSA junior
Jared Boot, the chair of the
University's Students for Rom-
ney, said though his party lost
the presidency, they were con-
soled by electoral success in the
Supreme Court races and the
ballot proposals.
Proposal 1- the only proposal
supported by Republican Rick
Snyder, which would continue
to allow the state government
the right to establish emergency
financial managers in strug-
gling cities - passed by a narrow
margin. Proposals 2 through 6,
opposed by Snyder, all failed to
garner enough support. .
"We put up a good fight," Boot
said. "We've made a presence on
campus, people know we exist,
and hopefully people respect our
positions better."
Boot added that the unclear
outcome of the popular vote -
which shows Obama leading by
less than 500,000 votes as of 4
a.m. according to the Associ-
ated Press - is a mandate for
the president to work more col-
laboratively with Republicans in
Congress.
"We're looking for the bright
spots," Boot said. "The governor
was very proud of that - he's
worked tirelessly on those six
proposals and he's very pleased
with the results that are com-
ing in. He'll keep moving Michi-
gan's economy forward, thanks
to people realizing that special
interests can't have a hold on our
constitution."
Political Science Prof. Michael
Heaney said that while the elec-

cratic, dating back to former
President Bill Clinton's victory in
the state in the 1992 presidential
election.
In Wood County, a critical
district in Ohio, the election was
particularly close, with Obama
winning by less than 3,000 votes
out of about 60,000 ballots cast.
Though the chairs of the coun-
ty Democratic Party and Republi-
can Party said before the election
they anticipated that the county
would likely be closely contest-
ed, students at Bowling Green
State University in Wood County
seemed to favor Obama.
BGSU undergraduate student
and Romney supporter Paige
Pitts, said she found the liberal
bias of her peers frustrating.
"It was really upsetting," Pitts
said. "I feel like my age group is
such a moldable time, and the
fact that it was so biased made me
really upset."
Just as he did four years ago,
Obama swept to victory with
the help of high turnout among
youth, African American and
Latino voters.
tion was suspenseful, student
participation was somewhat
below average. However, he
noted it was difficult to over-
come the spirit and exhilaration
of the 2008 campaign.
"2008 was just an exception-
ally exciting election," Heaney
said. "There are two things
you've got to keep in mind:
how dark and terrible the Bush
(years) were, and bringing the
first African-American president
and this younger man who was
such a charismatic speaker. 2008
was the most exciting election of
my lifetime."
By 9 p.m., nearly 200 students
and alumni filled the Union's
University Club room as results
began rolling across televi-
sion screens. Gathering around
crowded tables adorned with
colorful balloons, posters and
streamers, students nibbled on
ice cream bars while keeping
their eyes locked on the results.
The event, sponsored by the
Center for Campus Involvement,
drew students from across the
political spectrum. At one table,
a group of Obama supporters
donned buttons and cheered
with each state that turned blue
on the electoral map, while oth-
ers donned Michigan Republican
Party T-shirts.
Overall, cheers for Obama vic-
tories dominated the night, espe-
cially when networks announced
an Obama win in Michigan.
"I felt elated when Obama
captured the state of Michi-
gan," Kinesiology senior Miatta
McCrummady said. "I voted for
him the first time and I voted for
him again today."
McCrummady said she stood
with Obama primarily due to his
support for women's rights and
the middle class.
Before the election was called
later in the evening, Romney
supporters remained optimistic
and hopeful about the Republi-
can nominee's victory.
"This is huge, him being re-

Rather than directing efforts
and funding toward television
advertisements as the Romney
campaign did, Obama focused
on get-out-the-vote efforts to
secure the presidency, accord-
ing to Aaron Kall, director of the
University of Michigan debate
program.
"The turnout was probably
the most important factor," Kall
said. "The (Obama campaign's)
get-out-the-vote effort was
excellent, starting with the early
voting."
Obama will now return to
the White House with the task
of implementing the Afford-
able Care Act, continuing the
economic recovery and ending
the war in Afghanistan amid a
host of other initiatives that will
require bipartisan support, espe-
cially since Republicans main-
tained control of the U.S. House
of Representatives, despite Dem-
ocratic gains in the U.S. Senate.
After celebrating at the elec-
tion night rally here; attendees
said they expect the president to
continue rebuilding the country
elected," LSA sophomore Kiana
Alexander said. "As a black per-
son, he represents the dream.
America really is the land of
opportunity. You really can be
anything."
Further down State Street,
North Quad Residence Hall host-
ed a watch party event of about
30 students, where discussion
focused primarily on the foreign
policy stances of the two candi-
dates - seemingly fitting for a
theme community focused on
international studies.
LSA junior Nora Dagher said
she talked to many international
students who, though ineligible
to vote, said they feel impacted
by the election.
"The whole world is watch-
ing at this point," Dagher said.
"Whoever wins will affect the
rest of the world as well."
LSA junior Nick Hill, who
concentrates in Middle Eastern
studies and political science,
said he has kept a special focus
on international affairs while
following the election.
"I think the rhetoric that
Obama shows is better towards
the Middle East," he said. "They
look positively toward Obama
and they don't really like the
rhetoric Romney shows."
"The U.S. is a major player in
-world politics," Rackham stu-
dent Ricky Punzalan said. "I feel
like if the wrong person gets the
job, it will dictate the future of
not only the U.S., but the world
stage as well."
When NBC first announced
that Obama won re-election,
cheers erupted across the room.
Students jumped out of their
seats, rushing to embrace their
fellow supporters with hugs of
relief and excitement, or reach-
ing for their phones to compare
reactions with friends and rela-
tives.
Across the street, it was dif-
ficult to shuffle through the
crowd at the State Street Buffalo
Wild Wings, where students in

moving forward.
"(In 2008), we had no direc-
tion - we were headed down
to the pits of hell, let's say that,"
Washington, D.C. resident Clint
McPherson said. "I'm more
excited now because we're going
somewhere. We're going some-
where."
When Montgomery, the Chi-
cago resident who danced in the
aisle, paused to reflect on what
the election meant for the coun-
try, he said Obama's re-election
will change the course of the
country's history.
"This is a referendum on two
views of what the country should
be, and it's very clear, not by just
by the fact that the president won,
that the American people want to
move this country forward in the
way that Obama describes," he
said. "I think that's the bottom
line."

the Ford School of Public Policy
gathered together to watch the
results amid the aroma of teri-
yaki chicken wings.
At a table in the back of the
restaurant, Public Policy senior
Matthew Mejia gathered with
fellow policy students to await
the results. Waitresses bustled in
and out to replace plates of wings
between cheers for Obama victo-
ries.
For Mejia, the electric atmo-
sphere harkened back to the
campus excitement of 2008.
"It's a really exciting night
and it's a really important night,"
Mejia said. "You hear the cheers,
you hear the boos. If nothing
else, you can tell that people care
and I think that I think is a really
important thing. That is encour-
aging."
Nearby, Public Policy gradu-
ate student Matt Papadopoulos
sported a Romney/Ryan sticker
as he took in the results.
"Today is an expression of
American democracy1" Papado-
poulos said. "Regardless of what
happens, the American people
had a chance to voice their opin-
ion and I think that's an impor-
tant right that we all have and it's
exciting to be able to use that and
be apart of that process."
Papadopoulos said he is
curious to see how the Obama
administration tackles national
issues over the next few years.
"Washington, D.C. has kind
of been at a stalemate for the
few years," Papadopoulos said.
"Ultimately, we elect our offi-
cials regardless of party or where
they come from - we elect our
officials to do things, not to stop
doing things. And really, that's
something that I would like to see
continue happening, regardless
of specifically what ideology that
might service to."

Reminiscing famous
backstage rap brawls

By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
Hip hop is sophisticated now,
haven't you heard? Kanye West
interned at Fendi. Rick Ross
owns Maybachs - yes, as in more
than one. Birdman started an oil
company, and as if that weren't
enough, hegot a freakin' oil well
tattooed on his head. Google it.
Jay-Z knows Obama and travels
to Europe more times per month
than you will in your entire life.
Rappers are no longer rappers -
no, they're artists now, and hip
hop deserves to finally be relieved
of its stereotype as an immature
and pugilistic genre.
Well, notnso fast. No matter how
"sophisticated" hip hop is today, it
will never shed its most endearing
and self-destructive quality: the
craziness of the people involved.
From Ol' Dirty Bastard to DMX,
hip hop was founded on and will
always be associated with eccen-
tricity and public disregard. Rap-
pers, with a few exceptions, are
a feral, egotistical, strip club-fre-
quenting, weed-smoking, chain-
wearing group of troublemakers.
And no matter how'many Europe-
an countries they've visited, they
will never be able to completely
hide who they really are.
This insuppressible truth has
produced, for almost 20 years,
a combination that somehow
always seems to go wrong: rap-
pers and award shows.
The Source Awards, while
trouble-free for the majority of its
existence, will forever be marred
by two unforgettable events. In

It's no surprise that Dear has
several on-stage identities, given
the lyrics of Beams that admit,
"It's alright to be someone else
sometimes." But for concerts
under his own name, Matthew
Dear gets real.
SERIES"When performing as myself,
it's a bit more personal," Dear
said. "When you're doing some-
thing as Audion as a DJ, it's
more about escaping yourself
when you're going to the dance
floor ... You're kind of there to
escape reality. Whereas when
you're there performing with the
band, it's more about connecting
directly. When you're on stage
with a band, you're presenting
CP, FACC, FAHA something that's right from your
soul."
Administrator, This isn't to say that there
es won't be a substantial amount
of grooving in the crowd, on
Wednesday, Dear explained.
ITIATIVE "The last time we played (atthe
Blind Pig), there was such a great
energy in the crowd," Dear said.
"Pretty much the whole crowd
was dancing and totally rocking
out and having fun. I'm really
looking forward to just having an
amazing party."
Of course, the show is in Ann

Arbor, so Dear won't exactly be
partying with strangers.
"My old bass player and drum-
mer who performed with the
band in the very beginning will
be at the show," he said. "And
there might be a surprise encore
where they come up on the stage
and it all ends with a total free-
for-all."
Beyond the nostalgia, Ann
Arbor has played a vital role in
Matthew Dear's career, serving
as a launch pad into everything
musical during his "grassroots-y"
undergraduate years.
"I met these guys at a record
store called Grooveyard," he said.
"I just put up a little poster that
said,'I wanna make music. Here's
my number. Call me.' And'I got
with some techno guys up there
so it was very person-to-person,
very personal."
"There was such an amaz-
ing little group of people living
there at the time," he added. "And
it totally changed the way that
I made music and my ability to
make music. I think there was
an energy there that was exactly
what we needed as a label to get
started."
But it wasn't enough for Dear
to simply make music in Ann
Arbor -'he went ahead and co-
founded Ghostly International,
a record label based here. So
how does one (or two, rather)
go about creating a label from
,scratch? As Dear explained, it
turns out that going to a good
old-fashioned college party may
be a viable first step.
Dear described meeting Sam
Valenti - "the true owner of
Ghostly" - at a house party
"He met me right around the
time when he was forming these
ideas about the label, and I hap-

Michigan unveils rotation

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
Shed was the operative word
for the No. 5 Michigan basketball
team's preseason.
Mitch McGary shed some
pounds to get into playing shape.
The Wolverines' prized fresh-
men shed their gift wrapping
and revealed what they can do at
the college level. The team took
two Division-II weaklings to the
woodshed. And Michigan coach
John Beilein shed some light on
how his new pieces would figure
into this team's rotation.
After sophomore point guard
Trey Burke announced last spring
that he would bypass the NBA
Draft to return to Ann Arbor,
there seemed to be two givens in
the startinglineup.
Burke would return at point
guard and junior Tim Hardaway
Jr. would be on one of the wings.
After that, there were questions.
Fans wondered whether McGary
or oft-injured redshirt sophomore
Jon Horford would replace the
only other returning starter, Jor-
dan Morgan, in the post.
Or would Beilein get innova-
tive and depart from his one-
post offense to accommodate the
influx of size? Many suspected
that freshman Glenn Robinson
II would be found in the starting
five, but who knew? Would expe-
rience or expectation triumph in
deciding the final starting spot?
Eighty minutes of crisp basket-
ball settled most of the questions,
and what remains to be seen is
how players react to roles, which
will dictate how Beilein will
switch things up as the season
progresses.
Morgan's spot in the starting
five is secure. He's a steady pres-
ence. Though he isn't a dynam-
ic scorer, he defends well, has
improved his rebounding, shoots
for a high percentage and stays
within himself.

Mac Bennett earns CCHA weekly defenseman honors

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
After a weekend that saw the
No. 12 Michigan hockey team
give up eight goals and escape
with just two points - a shootout
victory on Friday night - against
No. 16 Northern Michigan, there
was little to be pleased about,
especially defensively.
But junior defenseman Mac
Bennett's performance on the
weekend was nothing to be
scoffed at. Bennett tallied'a goal

and an assist in each of the games
in Marquette.
His four-point weekend and
defensive performance were
enough to earn him the title of
CCHA Gladiator Defenseman of
the Week for the first time in his
career.
Despite his impressive per-
formance, the defensive corps,
struggled to control the slot
around the crease and suffered
too many missed assignments,
ultimately leading to a flurry of
easy, point-blank Wildcat goals.

Michigan coach Red Beren-
son has continuously said the
Wolverines' struggles this past
weekend were attributed to
problems in the "defensive-zone
coverage." Bennett argeed.
"I think we need to take pride
in D-zone coverage," he said.
"It's just little things. It's for-
wards picking up their points or
defensemen having better sticks
in the D-zone. I think if we can
build off the D-zone our offen-
sive firepower will just come."
One area where the offensive

firepower hasn't been a problem
is Bennett's offensive produc-
tion this season. His four-point
performance against North-
ern Michigan moved his sea-
son totals to three goals and six
assists - nine points total. Ben-
nett leads all CCHA defenseman
in points and is fifth overall in
the conference. Only senior for-
ward A.J. Treais has more points
than Bennett on the team.
Offensive success isn't an
unexpected result from Ben-
nett, though. The Narragansett,
R.I. native finished with four
goals and 17 assists for a total
of 21 points last season. But the
impetus behind Bennett's high
numbers so far might be the
diminished defensive corps.
Senior defenseman Jon Mer-
rill - a pre-season all-CCHA
team selection - was injured
during Michigan's preseason
exhibition against Windsor and
has yet to see the ice.
There have also been other
injuries and issues - fresh-
man defenseman Jacob Trouba

of a suspension for a hit he had
Friday night and sophomore
defenseman Brennan Serville
missed the entire weekend with
a "facial concussion" - which
have resulted in Bennett and
senior defenseman Lee Moffie
filling in for holes in the defen-
sive zone.
"He's a rushing defenseman,"
Berenson said. "(He) skates real-
ly well and carries the puck really
well. The way the game is played
now, if you're playing hard in the
other team's zone, sooner or later
the puck comes back to the point
and they've got to get it through.
Mac is one of those guys that's
findinga way to get it through."
Berenson also noted that Ben-
nett's wrist shot and not "big
slapshots," has been important
for him to.get the puck to the net.
Along with increased offen-
sive productivity, Bennett has
also found himself in a different
role. The absence of Merrill, a
unit boasting just one senior in
Moffie and a plethora of young
defensemen has given Bennett a

"I'm more of a mentor now
than I was learning as a younger
player," Bennett said. "I think
what I can try to do is if I can
bring consistency night in and
night out, hopefully guys like
Trouba, or (sophomore defense-
man Mike) Szuma or someone
like that can kind of pick up from
it."
Michigan has boasted the
highest-scoring offensive attack
this season in the CCHA. But it
also comes out of the weekend in
Marquette with the conference's
second-worst goals against aver-
age.
Bennett knows the defensive
corps will need to pull it togeth-
er and perform at a higher level
if the Wolverines hope to keep
games from becominghigh-scor-
ing contests.
He also knows that accolades
such as defenseman of the week
are pointless if it comes after
Michigan had a losing weekend.
"It's an honor but the bigthing
is that we just lost four points up
at Northern," he said. "It's kind

A red champion in a sea of blue

By Zach Bergson

Name: Rachael Jankowski, Chair of College Republicans
Hometown: Shelby Township, Mich.
School and Year: LSA senior
Concentration: Political Science and History
What has College Republicans been doing leading up to
the election?
We've been getting out the vote for Romney. Going door to
i>or in Washtenaw County and making tons of phone calls
- we just made over 10,000 calls. We've been having speak-
ers come to campus who are running in the local and state
races. We had Eric Cantor come in and tailgate with us, and
Ann Romney was in the state recently so we sent some people
there.
How did you get involved in College Republicans? Have
you always been passionate about conservative politics?
I was Republican-leaning all of my life. I guess I was raised
that way, but coming here made me more Republican, shock-
ingly. I think it's because I wanted to figure out my own path
Mnd educate myself on issues, rather than being fed it. I felt
like my professors weren't giving
unbiased positions on things, so
I started researching and looking
things up and goingto conferences
in D.C. Then I got involved in Col-
lege Republicans right away fresh-
man year, but I wasn't too involved
until last year.
Last year I wanted to work with
other groups, so I became the
coalitions chair and that was basi-
-eilly working on outreach with
other like-minded Republican
groups. And then I was elected
chair of College Republicans last
year.
When you wake up Wednesday
morning and you turn on the
TV, who won the election and
why did they win, in your opin-
ion?
Mitt Romney is going to win, Refina
cause Americans realize that
we can't afford four more years of
what we've had. I think when peo-
ple become educated about it and
they realize what the president
has done over the past four years
to help the economic catastrophe
teat he inherited, they're going
to realize that he hasn't really
owned up to it and hasn't turned it
around. I think they'll realize that

the unemployment rate is too high and it's higher now than it
was when he was elected. He hasn't done enough.
Conversely, you wake up Wednesday morning and Presi-
dent Obama won. What does that mean for the Republi-
can party, specifically, College Republicans?
I think it would be a time for Republicans in Congress and
everyone to reevaluate what they've done over the past four
years, and realize that its time to work together to actually solve
the problem, rather than punting the football down the road.
Are you saying the House Republicans should work with
Obama?
Yeah. Not to compromise your beliefs at all, but I think Presi-
dent Obama needs to sit down with the Republicans in Con-
gress and say that we do need to work together to solve this,
because this is bigger than any political party. We need to
work together to solve the debt problem and the employment
problem. We need to pass a budget - that's probably the big-
gest thing - because not having a budget passed is a scary
thing.

I also think its time that we really sit down and focus on what
needs to be changed, and what we can do to change it. It's
going to be a time, I think, of renewal and new beginnings. No
one should compromise their beliefs at all, but there needs to
be more cohesiveness and working together.
It sounds like you guys have really thought about what's
next if he loses. Doyou expecthimto lose?
I don't think we've really thought about it. We think he has a
really good chance of winning. But, you know, in the end it's
about the United States of America, it's not about any political
party or who wins.
This is a very liberal campus. What's your advice to
incoming freshmen who have conservative views?
Believe that there are Republicans on this campus. People
seem to think that they're the only one but they're not. There
are hundreds of College Republicans on this campus and you
just have to come find us. We are here and we can be their
outlet in what can sometimes be a hostile environment for
Republicans.

Online comments
ThenPort Huron Statement and all of its ripple effects, noted by Mr
Hayden, are what made and continue to make the University of Michigan
the premier liberal university in the land. Cal Berkeley and Columbia had
their heydays but this stuff was substantive and in hard copy. It stands true
today as a guiding document for the pursuit of true democracy and eco-
nomic justice. John Lennon and JFK came to Ann Arbor on the heels of this
most important document. Thank you Mr Hayden!
-Anonymous, regarding "Fifty years later"
By 1967, Hayden, always a liberal, was irrelevant to SDS. Now he's a
millionaire Democrat. He never sold out. He never sought a mass, activist,
class conscious movement. Rather, he substituted his ego and profiteering
for that and now he comes today, pretending to radicalism, selling his soap
all over. The core issue of our time is the reality of the promise of perpetual
war and booming color coded inequality met by the potential of an orga-
nized movement ready to take action at the radical (rootsJ of things: the
system of capital and its twin, imperialism. Rich Gibson wrote that, long
ago, and he was right.

DETROIT - A table by the front
door is decked out in red, white
and blue. Ballot literature covers
its surface. Most in the room wear a stick-
er on their jacket that reads, "I voted." But
this is not a polling place. It's the Detroit
Action Commonwealth Capuchin Mel-
drum soup kitchen.
Clipboard in hand, LSA senior Amy Nav-
vab - a volunteer at Students for Detroit
Action Commonwealth - called out names
of people who had waited, some for hours,
for a seat to open up in a University stu-
dent's car. Michael Myles, a Detroit native
had arrived at the building at 8:30 a.m.
but had to wait until a little after 1 p.m. to
secure his ride to his polling location. For
Myles, this was his first time ever casting
a ballot.
"I made it my business to say I was going
to vote," Myles said.
Detroit Action Commonwealth isn't
interested in short-term solutions or
charity - they're action-oriented, aimed
at empowering the low-income popula-
tion of Detroit to advocate for themselves.
Founded by Political Science Prof. Greg-
ory Markus just five years ago, D.A.C. is
unique in that it was built up by the same
low-income Detroit community members
who frequent its three soup kitchens dot-
ting the blighted east side of Detroit.
Here on Election Day, they are here to
make sure that low-income community
members of Detroit have the transporta-
tion and information they need in order to
make an informed decision, often physi-
cally driving these members to the polls.
Markus pointed out that even during one
of the worst recessions in recent memory,
low-income populations aren't brought up
in the debates. They're generally not even

part of the discussion.
According to Markus, this population
wants to vote but lacks access to transpor-
tation and voting information. Often, they
are nervous about voting after being locked
out of the political sphere for so long.
D.A.C was thus developed as a space to
"build collective power" so that the govern-
ment will recognize the community members
of Detroit as constituents worth talking to.
D.A.C. board member Mary Johnson,
who first encountered the organization
when she picked up a food basket from one
of the kitchens, said she "truly thought it
was a responsibility for all of us that your
voice is heard," Johnson said.
"People think my vote doesn't count, or
if you've been incarcerated or you don't
have a place to live, (you shouldn't vote),"
she said. "That has nothing to do with vot-
ing. As long as you're a registered voter,
you can vote."
Barriers for low-income voters
According to state records, thousands
of Detroit residents don't exist. They don't
have any state identification. Without
identification, a person can't get a job, rent
an apartment or open a bank account.
In recent years, various states have
adopted stringent voter laws that require
a state-issued ID in order to vote. But in
Michigan, the requirement isn't as strict.
One might be asked for an ID, but voters
can opt to sign an affidavit affirming their
identity in lieu of handing over identifica-
tion.
The problem isn't, as various D.A.C.
members and students organizers stressed,
well-known among the low-income and
indigent populations in Detroit who stay in

homeless shelters. Many of the barriers for
voting are mental in addition to logistical
due to the spread of misinformation about
enfranchisement rights.
"People have a lot of fear ... they feel as
though the system continues to let them
down, they no longer have the confidence
that normal people have," said Arinett
Ross, a D.A.C. board member who spent
the morning rush manning the voter infor-
mation table at Meldrum. "Because their
confidence level is put down to zero, they
feel like, 'Why should I vote?'".
The student connection
This is where the University fits in. A
number of University students not only
drove community members to the polls,
but also helped register them prior to Elec-
tion Day and escorted them inside if they
felt nervous about voting.
As a result of D.A.C.'s efforts, members
have won various victories, such as getting
represented on the Homeless Action Net-
work of Detroit that distributes resources
to homeless shelters in Detroit for the first
time.
"The goal of the organization is pretty
much to develop leaders," said Public Pol-
icy senior Brock Grosso, who helped drive
community members to the polls. "And
that kind of has its own snowball effect
helping people gain control over their own
lives and helping people have equal and
adequate influence on policies that are
affecting their lives such as the channels
of funding in shelters."
Markus teaches two political science
classes focused on Detroit and commu-
nity organizing that acts as a pipeline for
University students to get involved with

D.A.C.
Navvab noted that students could lever-
age their privilege and experience to act
as .effective organizers at D.A.C. This is
demonstrated by the fact that student.
donated their time and cars to help shuttle
community members throughout Detroit
to their respective polling stations, some
as far flung as Dearborn. And when Myles
wasn't sure which station he was supposed
to vote at, Navvab was able to utilize her
smartphone to quickly look it up.
What both Grosso and Navvab stressed
was that organizing involves immersing
oneself in the community.
"It's easier for us to work together if I
know basics about who you are as a per-
son," Navvab said. "It's important for n
to know silly things."
Navvab pointed to Greg, a Detroit com-
munity member that she had helped drive
to the polls, and the fact she knew he
owned 400 Hot Wheels. "Even though our
lives are different, we can still see each
other as people and connect," Navvab said.
Markus echoed this statement when he
said that it didn't make sense for the state
to make it difficult for low-income citizens
to participate in the political environment
because it undermines democratic values.
"That's how democracy is supposed to
work," Markus said.
On the drive from his poll station,
Myles, who was anxious about takinga day
off work, nevertheless noted how impor-
tant it was for everyone to vote. The first-
time voter credited meeting people at the
Meldrum shelter for helping "turn his life
around." He seemed pleased that he had
made his voice heard.
"I feel better when I vote," Myles said.

Wednesday, November 7, 2012 // The Statement

The moderator talks into the microphone -
testing, one, two, yep, much better. The audience
wanders from the coffee machines back to their
seats. It's the first full day of the University's Port
Huron Statement conference, this two-part work-
shop, one-part reunion honoring the 50th anniver-
sary of the New Left manifesto.
Under the chandeliers of the Michigan Union
Pendleton Room, seven students in blazers and
button-ups gather to discuss the impact of the doc-
ument. More importantly, they're talking about
the students of the 60s, our can't-stop, won't-stop
predecessors that shook this campus - shook the
ideas of any campus, really - until it was blue in
the face.
The whole thing makes them uneasy.
"The 60s were a time of huge social change -
you know, with rallies and protests," one of the
