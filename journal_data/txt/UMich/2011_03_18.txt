DETROIT - Collaborations
between the University and the
Motor City was the main topic
of discussion at the University's
Board of Regents meeting here
yesterday.
Three Uni- NOTEBOOK
versity-affiliat-
ed groups made presentations to
the Board regarding the impor-
tance of the University's partner-
ships with Detroit organizations.
The presentations - made
by Semester in Detroit partici-
pants, researchers working on

nership and graduate students
involved in Revitalization and
Business: Focus Detroit - all
stressed the University's integral
role in improving the city.
In her opening remarks, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man said it was important to
meet in Detroit because many of

the city's leaders are University
alumni.
"We are pleased to have so
many engaged partners in met-
ropolitan Detroit," Coleman said.
"Together we are all committed
to a strong future for our state."
Student participants of Semes-
ter in Detroit, a University pro-
gram in which students live, take
classes and intern in the city for
a term, talked about their expe-
riences to the regents. The stu-
dents explained how their time
in Detroit enriched their lives and
strengthened their commitment
to Michigan.
Charles Bright, faculty to-
director of Semester in Detroit,
said the program is operating on
limited resources. He advised the
regents to take a more active role
in the program to ensure its sus-
tainability over time.
Later in the meeting, Amy
Schulz, an associate professor in
the University's School of Public
Health, and Angela Reyes, execu-
tive director of the Detroit His-
panic Development Corporation,
discussed the Healthy Environ-
ments Partnership's work pro-
moting cardiovascular health in

Regents approve Snyder
to speak at 'U' graduation

Students urge
Board not to vote
in favor of governor
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
DETROIT - The University's
Board of Regents unanimously
approved Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder as the Spring Commence-
ment speaker despite opposition
from thousands of University

students.
Several students made the trip
to the regents' meeting here to
tell the Board why they didn't
think Snyder was the right choice
to deliver the commencement
address on April 30 because of
his proposed reductions to state
higher education appropriations.
However, the Board ultimately
voted to approve Snyder and the
other honorary degree recipi-
ents.
The decision to have Sny-
der give this year's commence-

ment speech has caused outrage
among many students in light of
his state budget proposal, which
calls for a 15-percent funding cut
to the state's 15 public colleges-
and universities in the 2012 fis-
cal year. A cut of that size would
translate into a loss of $47.5 mil-
lion dollars for the University.
LSA senior Zach Goldsmith
was among the handful of stu-
dents who implored the regents
to reconsider their votes in sup-
port of Snyder as commence-
ment speaker.

Goldsmith said at the meeting
that Snyder's budget proposal
makes him an illogical choice
for commencement speaker. The
proposal includes cuts to educa-
tion funding and grants power
to emergency financial manag-
ers, who Snyder can appoint
to restore budgets in cities and
school districts in fiscal distress.
"I'm not going to rattle off the
facts and figures that explain the
idiocy," said Goldsmith, refer-
ring to the governor's budget

YUJI FURUYA/AP
A meeting is held by officials of Fukushima Prefecture's Emergency Response Headquarters in Fukushima, north of
Tokyo on Monday, March 14. Dangerous levels of radiation are leaking from a crippled nuclear plant in Fukushima.
International agency calls Japanese
nuclear situation 'serious'=but 'stable'

IAEA draws
increased scrutiny
following crisis
VIENNA (AP) - The situa-
tion at Japan's tsunami-stricken
nuclear plant is "very serious,"
but at the moment does not
appear to be deteriorating, a
senior official of the U.N. atomic
agency said yesterday.
As emergency workers
frantically worked to regain
control of the dangerously over-
heated nuclear complex, Graham
Andrew told reporters "there had
been no significant worsening"
over the past 24 hours at the crip-
pled plant.
Andrew, a senior aide to Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency
chief Yukiya Amano, emphasized
that the situation could change
quickly, either improving or esca-
lating into a wider catastrophe.
"It hasn't gotten worse, which
is positive, But it is still possible
that it could get worse," he said.
"We could say it's reasonably
stable at the moment compared to
yesterday."
Andrew appeared to be the
first senior IAEA official to say
that the situation has not sig-
nificantly deteriorated since the
agency began briefings Mon-
day. On Wednesday, Amano had
described the situation as "very

serious," adding "it is difficult to
say" if events were spinning out
of control.
Andrew spoke shortly after
Amano flew to Tokyo to assess
efforts to fight the nuclear havoc
unleashed by the massive earth-
quake and tsunami that hit
Japan's northeastern coast Fri-
day.
It was unclear what Amano
hoped to accomplish during his
one-day trip; he has said he plans
to stay in Tokyo and meet with
government officials but he had
no agenda or scheduled meetings
before takeoff from Vienna inter-
national airport.
"We don't have a fixed sched-
ule and don't have all the infor-
mation so we will be thinking on
our feet," Amano told reporters
assembled in the departure hall.
Still, he suggested his trip
was symbolically important as
his home country wrestles with
its worst nuclear crisis since the
bombing of Hiroshima and Naga-
saki 66 years ago.
"Japan is not alone, the inter-
national community is standing
by Japan," Amano declared. "We
have lots of offers of assistance to
Japan and I would like to convey
this message to them."
In Japan, military helicopters
dumped loads of sea water onto
the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant
yesterday as they tried to cool
overheated uranium fuel that

may be on the verge of spewing
out more radiation.
As the crisis unfolds in
Japan, the IAEA has been under
increased scrutiny as to whether
it has done enough to increase the
safety culture in the nuclear reac-
tor industry.
A U.S. Embassy cable from
three years ago on the WikiLeaks
website published yesterday by
Britain's "The Guardian" daily
cited criticism of Tomihiro Tam-
niguchi a senior IAEA official
in charge of nuclear safety and
security, who stepped down two
years ago.
It described him as a "weak
manager ... particularly with
respect to confronting Japan's
own safety practices."
The IAEA declined comment,
and officials at yesterday's brief-
ing sidestepped specific ques-
tions on how the agency's safety
recommendations applied to the
Fukushima Dai-ichi plant.
But while conceding the
enormity of the Japan disaster,
Andrew defended the "enviable
safety record" of the nuclear sec-
tor in terms of deaths compared to
"other ways of creating energy."

they do not expect harmful radi-

Anti-government

More than 10,000 anti-gov-

in Armenia's capital.
Opponents of President Serzh
Sargsyan have several demands,
including the release of their
incarcerated colleagues and snap
elections.
Their leader, former Presi-

revolts in the Arab world have
inspired the protest movement,
but is vowing any change in gov-

That represents a change of
tactics for the combative Ter-
Petrosian, who in earlier protests
warned of a forceful overthrow.
Yesterday's rally in Yerevan
is the latest in a wave of demon-

Schulz said the group chose
the topic of cardiovascular dis-
ease because it is more preva-
lent in Detroit than in the rest
of the country. She explained
that the disease's high diag-
nosis rate can be attributed to
factors that contribute to high
blood pressure, such as air pol-
lution, lack of exercise and food
and environment stressors,
which many Detroit residents
face. For example, many people
living in Detroit have difficulty
finding places to exercise, she
said.
"They need not only to do
(exercise)," Schulz said, "but
places where they can do it and
do it safely."
Schulz and Reyes have
worked with community organi-'
zations to create walking groups
and promote physical activ-
ity, Schulz said, the results have
been encouraging.
"Based on the preliminary
data, people have increased their
number of steps," she said. "And
both their systolic and diastolic
blood pressure is coming down
significantly."
The presentation by Schulz
and Reyes was followed by

launch the program and gener-
ate interest about working in
Detroit, the organization hosted

Business School graduate
student David McCarty said at
the regents meeting that the
response to last year's confer-
ence was encouraging.

versity chapter though it will
be kept under "colony status"
starting in the fall, according to
the press release.
Brandon Weghorst, associate
executive director of commu-
nications for the SAE national
organization, said the "colony"
would consist of a new group of
young men who would have to
follow certain criteria.

This percentage is almost twice
as much as the average number

The Cardiovascular Cen-
ter implemented the Project
Healthy Schools program in
fall 2004 with the support of
local school districts as part of a
movement for increased collab-
oration between the University
and the greater community.
The main goal of the project is
to prevent long-term cardiovas-
cular problems. Initiatives of the
group include expanding physi-
cal education programs at local
schools, providing information
on healthy eating, inspiring
self-evaluation of lifestyle deci-
sions and working toward policy
change within the schools like
eliminating unhealthy foods in
The focus of the conference
last year motivated people to
think about Detroit and its pos-
sibilities.
"Everyone knows what the
conversation has been about
Detroit historically," he said.
"We didn't want to rehash that.
We wanted to focus on the
opportunities."
The group also sponsored a
program called Detroit Impact,
which paired students with
consulting firms in Detroit. Stu-
dents were asked to explore real
obstacles Detroit companies face
by working closely with the busi-
nesses.
McCarty said that in the
future, the group would like to
increase student and faculty
engagement in the Revitaliza-
tion and Business Conference
and establish programming year
round.
After the meeting, University
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman
(R-Ann Arbor) said she thought
the regents meeting in Detroit
was a success.
"I think it was really good to
have the meeting in Detroit,"
Newman said. "A lot of people
were excited to be invited to
come and be a part of it."
REGENTS APPROVE
NAMING OF LAWYERS
CLUB RESIDENCES
Members of the Board of
Regents unanimously voted to
name the north Lawyers Club
residences in honor of Charles T.
Munger, who recently donated
$20 million for the dormitory's
renovation.
The donation will fund
updates to the interior of the
residences, which will include
new heating, plumbing, Internet
access, and handicap accessibil-
ity.
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president
and chief financial officer, said
the donation will significantly
improve Law school students'
experiences.
"This gift is transforma-
tional," Slottow said. "The Law
School is doing so well thanks to
people like Mr. Munger."
Law School Dean Evan
Caminker said he is excited

about the renovations because
little attention has been paid
to other areas of the quadran-
gle, though time, energy, and
redevelopment plan with them,"
Weghorst said. "The chapter will
be classified as a colony, which
means it will be like having a
new group, and we will be start-
ing from ground zero to make
sure that they do everything that
a chapter is supposed to do."
Though current chapter mem-
bers are under suspension for
the term, they are expected to
be a part of the colony in the fall
semester, Weghorst said.
"They understand that they
are going to be goingthrough the
redevelopment with us," he said.
For the time being, the broth-
ers are still suspended, Weghorst
said.
The fraternity may be able to
get its regular status back next
year, according to the IFC press
release.

Before Project Healthy
Schools is implemented at a
middle school, the Cardio-
vascular Center evaluates the
resources the school has and
then tailors its core program to
fit that specific school, accord-
ing to DuRussell-Weston. She
said while any school in the area
is eligible to be part of the pro-
gram, in order for it to be suc-
cessful, the school must have a
staff willing to participate and
contribute some financial sup-
port.
She added that a benefit of the
program is that it's held during
the day, allowing the schools to
reach students, whereas many
other healthy habit programs
are after school hours.
"We're trying to change the
whole culture of the school,"
DuRussell-Weston said. "Teach-
ing doesn't just stand alone, kids
have to be able to practice what
they learn."
resources have been spent on
revitalizing academic spaces at
the school.
"Mr. Munger recognizes
education is a holistic experi-
ence," he said. "This fantastic
gift and the project that comes
along with us will allow us to
completely revitalize the Law-
yers Club."
Caminker also said the reno-
vations will allow the Lawyers
Club to meet the standards of the
Americans with Disabilities Act
and modern building code.
At their meeting, the regents
also approved $6 million worth
of renovations to the Univer-
sity Hospital. The project will
include new recovery and prepa-
ratorybays inthe MedicalProce-
dure Unit.
Ora Pescovitz, the Universi-
ty's executive vice president for
medical affairs, said the reno-
vations are necessary to update
important facilities at the hos-
pital.
"Simply, this will bring us up
to standards in the industry,"
Pescovitz said.
LAWSUIT DISMISSED
AGAINST THE'U',
MICHIGAN DAILY
At yesterday's meeting,
the regents received a liti-
gation report compiled by
Suellyn Scarnecchia, the Uni-
versity's vice president and
general counsel, detailing the
dismissal of a lawsuit filed
against the University and The
Michigan Daily by LSA senior
Julie Rowe, a former news edi-
tor for the Daily.
Rowe, who claims she was
falsely accused of plagiarism,
filed the lawsuit against the
University and the Daily in Feb-
ruary 2010. She also filed a sepa-
rate lawsuit against three now
former Daily editors that same
month.
The lawsuit against the Uni-
versity and the Daily was grant-
ed the summary disposition on
Feb. 9, 2011, according to Scar-
necchia's litigation report. The
case brought against the three
former editors is pending in
the Washtenaw County Circuit
Court, the report states.

against The Michigan Daily.
chapter will have the ability to
regain full status after at least a
year of colony status," the press
release states.
"Right now the chapter
remains under suspension,
which means they have to halt
activities until this fall when
we start on the redevelopment
plan," he said.
Chris Haughee, assistant
director of the University's
Office of Greek Life, wrote in an
e-mail interview that the Uni-
versity is pursuing disciplinary
action against members of the
fraternity.
"University disciplinary pro-
cesses have been initiated seek-
ing both group and individual
accountability," Haughee wrote.
The Office of Greek Life and
the University have a zero-toler-
ance policy for hazing, according
to the IFC press release.

plan.
Regent Laurence Deitch (D-
Bingham Farms) encouraged stu-
dents to voice their opinion if they
disagree with Snyder. He also
noted his differing political views
to the governor's, but he said he
supports Snyder as commence-
ment speaker.
"I personally don't agree with
(Snyder's) budget, but that's what
democracy's about. If students
wish to protest or picket, that is
the greatest Michigan tradition,
and we welcome that," Deitch
said.
He added, "I was born a Demo-
crat, and I'll die a Democrat, and
last year we were all thrilled to
be in Michigan Stadium when
President Obama spoke - at least
I was thrilled - but I think the
odds are at least half the stadium
didn't vote for him ... Governor
Snyder was elected by a majority
of Michigan."
On Wednesday, Goldsmith led
protests against Snyder on the
Diag and in front of the Fleming
Administration Building. About
30 protesters then marched into
University President Mary Sue
Coleman's office chanting, "Rick
is wrong."
In an interview after the
regentsmeeting, Coleman said she
was aware of the protests but was
"in a meeting somewhere" when
the students were in her office.
She said at the regents meeting
that she is looking forward to Sny-
der speaking at the ceremony.
"We are pleased that Gover-
nor Rick Snyder has accepted our
invitation to be the commence-'
ment speaker and address our
graduates," Coleman said. "His
appearance continues a U of M
tradition of inviting the newly
elected governor to be the gradua-
tion speaker. Governors Milliken,
Blanchard, Engler and Granholm
all have addressed graduating
classes, and Governor Snyder will
extend this tradition."
Also in attendance at the
regents meeting, LSA senior Rick
Durance presented the board
with an online petition he started
that has more than 4,000 signa-
tures. The petition declares the

Friday, March 18, 2011 - 3A
signees' opposition to Snyder as
commencement speaker.
Durance said his objective with
the petition was to change the
University's process of selecting
the commencement speaker in
upcoming years.
"We do not make this case
for ourselves, the class of 2011,"
Durance said. "Rather, we make
this case for future students. We
hope to improve the democratic
processes for choosing a com-
mencement speaker."
Durance also suggested poten-
tial replacements for Snyder
including filmmaker Spike Lee,
who will be awarded an honor-
ary degree at commencement, and
CNN broadcast journalist Ander-
son Cooper.
Several regents said they
appreciated the students' passion.
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman
(R-Ann Arbor) said she welcomes
any protests against Snyder.
"I wanted to thank students,"
Newman said. "We do appreciate
your letting us know how you feel.
It exemplifies free speech. We
appreciate the speeches and the
e-mails."
Regent Olivia Maynard (D-
Goodrich) expressed similar sen-
timents.
"I appreciate the dialogue. I
appreciate their coming here to
Detroit," Maynard said. "If I was
not a regent and was a student, I
would have been right there with
them."
But Maynard also said the Uni-
versity community should respect
Snyder because of his position.
"As a university, I think we
should honor the role and position
of the governor," Maynard said. "I
don't have to agree with him on
everything, but he is the governor
of the state of Michigan."
Goldsmith left the meeting
before the regents voted to return
to Ann Arbor for class, but said
in an interview last night that he
expected the Board's approval
of Snyder. He added that he was
appreciative the regents listened
to him.
"I was grateful that the regents
acknowledged that I drove over
an hour to speak with them," he
said.

Professional integrity
Attorney General needs to support what's lawful
Many employees struggle to separate where their profession-
al lives end and their personal lives begin. In 2009, Julea
Ward was dismissed from Eastern Michigan University's
counseling program after she refused to counsel a gay student seeking
help. According to the Detroit Free Press, Ward informed her supervi-
sor that because of her religious beliefs she thinks that homosexual-
ity is immoral and she couldn't support a gay student's relationship as
part of her training. Following her dismissal, Ward sued EMU, citing
religious discrimination. She claims the university infringed upon her
First Amendment rights, and her removal from the program was cen-
tered on her unwillingness to change her beliefs.

All "grown up"

According to a March 14 AnnArbor.com
article, a federal court dismissed Ward's case
in July. Though Ward and her attorneys are
within their rights in asking the United States
Court of Appeals to reconsider the case, the
court's original decision should be upheld.
EMU adheres to the Code of Ethics of the
American Counseling Association and the Eth-
ical Standards of the American School Coun-
selor Association. The American Counseling
Association's "Layperson's Guide to Counselor
Ethics" states "professional counselor(s) will
treat (patients) with respect and dignity, espe-
cially in regard to age, color, culture, disability,
ethnic group, gender, race, religion, sexual ori-
entation, marital status, or socioeconomic sta-
tus" By these standards, Ward clearly did not
adhere to her responsibilities as a counselor.
Ward's case isn't about religious discrimi-
nation. EMU is within their rights to dismiss
agraduate student who wouldn't represent the
professional integrity the school expectsgrad-
uates to uphold. Counselors have an obliga-
tion to behave in a proper way - obviously one
which befits the open-mindedness required
in their profession. Ward herself was clearly
discriminating against a demographic of stu-
dents, which is wrong regardless of her rea-
soning. Would a medical school allow students
to graduate if they informed their supervisors
they would not provide medical treatment to

African-American patients? The answer in
that case, as it is in this case, is clear.
No one is questioning Ward's rights to her
personal religious views. The issue is her
unwillingness to perform her job as she was
expected to, and because she failed in her
responsibilities, she was dismissed. The judi-
cial system has recognized this once, and the
appellate court should do the same.
What's most troubling is Michigan Attor-
ney General Bill Schuette's decision to release
a statement in support of Ward. He claimed
that religious freedoms don't fall by the way-
side on college campuses and that EMU is
setting a dangerous precedent that threatens
all students of faith. This statement ignores
the professional standards that Ward refused
to uphold. Even more concerning is Schuette
taking a stance at all: After former Attorney
General Mike Cox's questionable handling of
the Andrew Shirvell incident - in which the
assistant attorney general accused Michigan
Student Assembly President Chris Armstrong
of having a "radical homosexual agenda" -
Shuette's statement continues an alarming
trend of discrimination against homosexuals.
Contrary to Schuette's beliefs, Ward was
not dismissed for being a Christian, but rather
for failingto perform her job duties. It's impor-
tant that the First Amendment not be used as a
safety net for discrimination.

Irecently had an out-of-body
experience.
Let me set the scene for you.
I've been student teaching at Brigh-
ton High School
for a little more
than two months
now. At this stage
in the game, I'm
doi"g most of the
teaching every
day. I'm planning
lessons, setting
rules and trying RACHEL
to ensure that VAN GILDER
learning is actu-
ally happening.
For the most part, it's going really
well. Like with any job, there are
good days and bad days. There are
students who I really appreciate and
students who I just can't figure out.
But overall, I'm beginning to figure
out what kind of teacher I am.
But back to my out-of-body expe-
rience. It happened when I made
a pit stop in the restroom - which
probably isn't the most idyllic setting
for a revelation. I was wearing what
Kathryn Young, the coordinator
for the Undergraduate Secondary
Teacher Education Program in the
School of Education, calls "teacher
clothes" - which consist of sensible
slacks and a blouse - and a little bit
of makeup. After I finished washing
my hands, I looked up into the mir-
ror above the sink to check my hair.
I stopped and had to stare at myself
for a few seconds.
The young woman in the mirror
who was looking back at me was a
professional.
I didn't have a lot of time to con-
template the feeling at the time.
There were 28 high school seniors
waiting for me to talk about "All

Quiet on the Western Front." But
when I got home after school, I took
a few moments to consider what had
happened.
I remembered that scene in
"Finding Neverland" when Johnny
Depp, portraying the author of Peter
Pan, J.M. Barrie, tells the character
George Llewelyn Davies, "Some-
where during the last 30 seconds,
you've become a grown-up."
The moment I experienced felt
something like that. It was kind of
like getting a kick in the face. Bam!
You're an adult. Or, perhaps more
accurately, other people think you're
an adult. That's a pretty terrifying
thought when those other people are
high school seniors.
The students who I teach are gen-
erally a rambunctious bunch. They
are energetic, witty and never give
me a break. At 17 and 18 years old,
they think they're wise in the ways
of the world and that there's nothing
anyone can teach them about any-
thing.
It wasn't that long ago that I was
these students. When I was 17, I
thought I knew everything too. But,
of course, I was wrong. Now, at 21
years old, I'm about to graduate. I
spent a year as the editorial page
editor of a fantastic college newspa-
per discussing tense, controversial
issues with some very bright people.
I think I know a fair amount about
the way the world works. But when
I get that feeling, I wonder what I'll
think of 21-year-old Rachel when
I'm 25and 29 and 34.
Graduation gets a little nearer
and more real every day. I'm looking
toward the future with a mixture of
excitement and blind terror. After
May, I'm going to need to have a job
lined up, I'm going to need a loan

to buy a car and I'm going to need
insurance.
But at the same time, though I had
that feeling in the restroom, some-
times I still feel like I'm just playing
dress-up when I walk into the class-
room each day in business casual. I
look back at my senior year of high
school and wonder if I'll ever actu-
ally grow up or if I'll be clinging to
the second starfromthe rightfor the
rest of my life.
One day we will
all realize that
we are adults.
The purpose of college is for us
to start to become grown-ups. We
learn about chemistry, economics
and ourselves. But for the most part,
we still think of ourselves as kids.
Many of us are still dependent upon
our parents. As much as we want to
show how smart, sophisticated and
well-prepared for the world we are,
we're still just a bunch of college
kids.
At some point, we're all going to
have an epiphany that we're grown
up. Maybe this already happened
for you. If it hasn't, prepare yourself
now, because it's coming. It might
not happen until you get engaged or
you get your first promotion, but it's
going to happen. And you'll realize
that you are not Peter Pan, and you
are goingto have to grow up.

Snyder, I'm disappointed

There is a large issue in this state that very
few in Lansing are doing anything about. The
economy can wait - that comes and goes in
cycles. The prison system? Someone else can
handle that problem. I am talking, of course,
about the massive amounts of feral pigs run-
ning around this state, not to mention this
very county.
I know what you're thinking: Asa, this is a
ridiculous premise. There is no feral pig prob-
lem. You are clearly not putting enough time
into researching your work. I say to you, dear
reader, that you are wrong. Accordingto a Feb.
5 article in the Detroit News, anywhere from
3,000 to 5,000 of these dangerous pigs are
roaming around Michigan, possibly in your
own backyard.
The issue has gotten so out of hand that
these pigs have been given the ultimate in
hunting go-ahead. According to Depart-
ment of Natural Resources and Environment
spokesperson Mary Detloff, "Basically, our
policy is shoot first and ask questions later."
That's right, if you see one of these pigs you
can shoot to kill. But this isn't just an inconve-
nience for the state - the pigs are lethal. They
dig three feet into the ground, they destroy
acres of farmland and they can hit speeds of
30 mph. These sometimes 200-pound boars
can annihilate your land, eat your food, mate
with your sows and be gone before the rooster
crows to wake you up in the morning.
Not only are they large, nasty and pesky,
they also apparently are becoming wary of our
attempts at putting them down. One enterpris-

ing family had to build traps over the course of
a month because the pigs were catching on to
the movements of their enemies. We are offi-
cially at the point where we can stop being
concerned about Watson - the IBM computer
that competed on Jeopardy - killing us all,
and we can fear the true enemy of the future
- the hyper intelligent wild boar. Nothing is
more frighteningthan a 200-pound beast with
tusks moving 30 mph straight at you.
Luckily, there are some who are braver than
I. One particularly confident hunter claimed
in the Detroit News story that all the state
needed to do was put a bounty on the head of
the pigs. Throwing down the gauntlet, this
hunter said that ifa bounty was instituted the
pigs "wouldn't be a problem for very long."
The Detroit News has for years run articles
about the danger of the Asian Carp and the
risk they pose to the Great Lakes. However,
according to Dennis Fijalkowski, the execu-
tive director of the Michigan Wildlife Conser-
vancy, our fears have been misplaced. In the
same Detroit news article, he said, "People
are concerned about Asian Carp entering the
Great Lakes, but these pigs are already here."
So there you have it. The real danger animal
in the state is not some carp from Chicago, but
the pigs we have roaming our land right now. I
am going to let Fijalkowski have the last word
in this article due to his magnificent way with
words: "They are the enemy and should be
shot on sight."
Asa Smith is LSA Junior.

I wanted to give you a chance, Gov. Rick Snyder. I
really did. Your campaign as "One Tough Nerd" made
me chuckle. You seemed to be more moderate than your
Republican counterparts. You were a fresh face in a
dated crowd. But something about you just wasn't right.
Something about you was off, so I proceeded to vote
for your opponent Virg Bernero. When you won, I told
myself, "Whatever. I'm not too upset. He seems capable.
Let's give him a chance." Today, I realize I was wrongto
do so. I have lost all faith in you, Governor Snyder. Sadly,
it only took less than two months for me to feel this way.
It first started with your tax modifications. Logic
would say that, in order to balance the budget, you
would need to raise taxes. ButI don't think you thought
this through properly. You proceeded to raise taxes
for the poor and our senior citizens, which left me
confused. Where's the logic in that? Shouldn't those
who can actually afford to pay taxes be the ones to pay
taxes? I'm not saying we should raise taxes on the rich
or middle class by dramatic measures, but don't you
think it's a bit bizarre to make those who are suffering
suffer even more?
Then came the budget cuts. I knew they would be
harsh like you promised in your campaign, but even
with that anticipation in mind, I was left appalled.
Due to your massive cuts to education, Detroit Public
Schools is closing 70 of its 142 schools next school year.
Classroom sizes will swell to 60 students a class (that
is, if kids actually attend school in those horrible condi-
tions). Your logic is that charter schools will come in to
fill the void, but can you really expect this to happen in
a matter of months? DPS has been in a state of chaos for
years. Instead of trying to fix the problem, you decide
to cut education, which in turn will lead to more kids

not attending schools, higher crime rates and a lower
graduation rate - if it can go any lower. I know this is
cliche, but if we want to fix our future, shouldn't the
one thing we invest inbe education? According to you,
apparently not.
And, I found out you passed the Financial Manager
Bill? This law gives you the power to remove elected
local officials from power and place your own staff in
their place. Also, when you exercise this power, you will
be able to nullify collective bargaining agreements. Are
you even watching what's going on in Wisconsin? Don't
you think that this bill gives you too much of an iron fist?
Weren't you complaining about President Barack Obama
abusing his power? Where's the respect for the demo-
cratic process?It's one thingto provide strugglingtowns
with financial aid, financial experts and suggest alterna-
tive measures. It's another thing entirely to sidestep the
electoral process and dictate to a town you don't live in.
Enough is enough, Snyder. Iam sick and tired of your
destruction of our state. You have gone too far. It's only
been two months, but I think a little bit of change is in
order - whether that is in your mindset as governor,
the mindset of the people who have been content with
your failure or maybe even a change in who should be
in the governor's chair. I don't have all the answers to
our state's problems - they are complex and confusing
issues that don't have perfect answers. But I do know
that the solutions and methods you have used to address
our problems, thus far, make about as much sense as
burning our state to the ground with kerosene and Zippo
lighters. Actually, that might be a bit less destructive at
this point.

By MACKENZIE METER
DailyArts Writer
"Red Riding Hood" isn't the
most artfully adapted fairy tale. It
might not even be that great of a
movie. Howev-
er, the two men
feuding for the
heart of Val- Red Riding
erie (Amanda Hood
Seyfried, "Dear
John") are so At Quality16
'v damn fine that and Rave
it makes the
entire theater- Warner Bros.
going experi-
ence worth the effort.
The word "fine" is not used
lightly here. "Fine" barely even
begins to describe the chiseled,
Adonis-like attributes of Henry
(Max irons, "Dorian Gray"), the
wealthy fiance of the unwill-
ing Valerie. "Fine" also cannot
encompass the qualities of Val-
erie's true love Peter (Shiloh
Fernandez, "Happiness Runs"),
whose dark features and
scorching eyes basically make
audience members (at least the
females) turn green with envy
of Valerie's good fortune.
That being said, the story-
line is more or less bland. Since
it's an adaptation of the famous
children's tale, "Red Riding

Award-winning

tor Wooten,
and his name- The Ark
sake band will Sold out
be playing
with The Stanley Clarke band at
The Ark tomorrow at 7 p.m.
Expect nothing short of jazz
magic.
"The energy of the audience
just lifts you up," Wooten said in
a recent interview with the Daily.
"Sometimes that special energy
gets squeezed out of a recording
session."
Though audiences can expect
some songs off of Wooten's
recently re-released A Show Of
Hands 15, it's rare to find two
similar performances of the
same song in jazz - a live repro-
duction is sure to be unique.
However, be cautious -
though Wooten is a jazz bass-
ist, he isn't just confined to jazz.
While he will play what made
him famous, don't rule out influ-
ences from other genres.
"Music is bigger than any one
style," he said. "Back in the '60s,
we listened to everything. You
could hear all types of music,
even on the same station. You

could hear James Brown next
to The Beatles next to Led Zep-
pelin. Nowadays, things are all
segmented."
Music has deep roots in the
Wooten family, so it's no won-
der that Victor Wooten eventu-
ally picked up the bass. He once
learned an entirely new instru-
ment - the fiddle - just to land
a gig at Busch Gardens, and has
been known to play both the dou-
ble bass and the cello..
"I was born into the perfect
situation, being the youngest of
five brothers," Wooten said. "My
brothers knew that I was going
to be a bass player because that's
what they needed in the band."
Stanley Clarke, who will play
after Wooten at the Ark on Sat-
urday, has a long history with the
storied bassist. Through their
careers, the two have collaborat-
ed often, and with bassist Mar-
cus Miller, they released Thunder
in 2008.
Having first met when Wooten
was nine years old, Clarke and
Wooten re-met each other a few

years later as the young Wooten
was traveling and honing his
skills.
"He remembered meeting my
brothers and me when we were
kids. That was a little connec-
tion," Wooten said.
While Wooten has played with
a variety of musicians includ-
ing Bela Fleck, Chick Corea and
the Dave Matthews Band, he has
expressed interest in continuing
to work with other artists.
"There are many musicians
that I hope, one day, to get to
cross paths with in all walks of
life," Wooten said. "I could name
some jazz guys, there are some
rock people - I love Steve Vai as
a rock guitarist. There's Robert
Randolph, a great steel guitar
player I'd never played with -
that would be wonderful."
The concert tomorrow, then,
should be a spectacle to behold.
"I always tell people when
they come see us play that they're
going to hear something and see
something that they've never
seen before," Wooten said.

ever, in the long run, the love
story makes up for the lame and
unoriginal script.
Definitely don't expect a cut-
and-dry film that closely follows
the popular version of the tale.
While the script might be dumb,
there are thrills and action
throughout, especially once the
villagers learn the wolf is among
them. The tension between

'Paul' is off the wall
Pegg and Frost lead
high-flying cast in
alien bromance film I"

Outrageous celebrities
the perfect TV topping

By WILL DEFEBAUGH
Daily Arts Writer
There's something about Paul.
Rude? Yes. Smart-ass? Definitely.
Lazy? Inarguably. Cocky? You bet.
Sounds like the
guy you sit next *
to in English
class? Possibly. Paul
Except, of course,
Paul is an alien. A At Quality16
rude, smart-ass, and Rave
lazy, cocky alien. Universal
With a heart of
gold.
This is fairlyunusual for amovie
alien. After all, aliens are typically
supposed to be scary monsters
with a bunch of different mouths
that eat children for breakfast and
are sent to probe us and harvest our
planet for resources. But the only
resources that Paul (voiced by Seth
Rogan, "Pineapple Express"), star
of the movie of the same name, has
been harvesting since his acciden-
tal arrival on planet Earth in the
'80s are beer and marijuana. And
the result is one fantastic film. "
In a fateful accident that will
change all of their lives forever,
British sci-fi geeks Graeme Willy
and Clive Gollings (Simon Pegg and
Nick Frost, respectively, "Shaun of
the Dead") discover Paul smoking
in a cornfield by the side of the road.
After Paul asks for their assistance
in returning home, the two best
mates decide totake a detour from
their road-trip vacation through
America's UFO heartland to help
the green guy out.
Little do, they know that Paul
is being followed by a determined

"As you may have heard, the bird is the word."

government agent, Zoil (Jason
Bateman, TV's "Arrested Develop-
ment"), and FBI screw-ups Hag-
gard (Bill Hader, TV's "Saturday
Night Live") and O'Reilly (Joe
Lo . Truglio, "Superbad"). Behind
them is a crazed Christian father
bent on reclaiming his daughter,
one-eyed former fundamentalist
Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig, TV's
"Saturday Night Live"), who joins
Paul's party and starts a romance
with Graeme.
Add in cameos from Jane Lynch
(TV's "Glee"), Blythe Danner
("Meet the Fockers") and Sigour-
ney Weaver (the heroine of the
original "Alien" movies), and you
have one hilariously epic car chase
adventure story that will keep
audiences laughing long after they
leave the theater.
The film's genius is largely due
to its unforgettable cast of eccen-
tric characters and performances.
Graeme and Clive, thought to be
gay by just about everyone they
meet, demonstrate a friendship
that is both hysterical and moving.
They do this primarily by break-
ing stereotypes about straight male
friendships and British culture.
Perfectly embodying the mod-

ern bromance, they are very open
about their regard for one another.
They are unafraid to reveal their
true feelings - like when Clive
becomes jealous of Graeme for
seemingly moving on without him,
as Graeme discovered both the girl
and the alien.
But the real showstopper is Ruth
Buggs, whose character is one of
the most imaginative in any come-
dy to date. Specifically, her decision
to convert to atheism and subse-
quent inability to swear properly
due to lack of experience provide
limitless entertainment and new
phrases that will likely catch on
around college campuses every-
where. Then there are the clueless
FBI agents who just can't seem to
get it right, in the best way possible.
Last but not least is Paul, whose
originality is rivaled only by that of
the film itself.
"Paul" does more than just make
viewers laugh out loud. Director
Greg Mottola ("Superbad") and
writers Pegg and Frost have made
a film that is both humorous and
touching, exploring themes of
friendship, integrity and embrac-
ing change wherever it finds you -
even in a cornfield.

With Caporusso back, Blue
looks for back-to-back titles

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan hockey team
may have swept Western Michi-
gan in its only series meeting this
season, but that doesn't mean it
was easy.
When the 12th-ranked Broncos
invaded Yost Ice Arena a month
ago, the Wolver-
ines had to claw
their way back Michigan
in Saturday's vs Western
game. It was

with just 2.9
seconds left in
overtime.
"I don't think there's a big dif-
ference between the teams,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said. "When we played them here
on Friday night (Feb. 18), we got
the jump start. The puck went in
for us. But really, the game of the
weekend was the Saturday game,
when they came out and really
pushed back. They had that game
in the bag until the last minute ...
They'll be good. We just played
them. We know them and they
know us."
And after sweeping the Broncos
in mid-February, it was Western
Michigan who helped the Wol-
verines (20-7-1-0 CCHA, 25-9-4
overall) secure their 11th regular
season CCHA title by defeating
then-leader Notre Dame in the
final game of the season.

When these two squads meet at
Joe Louis Arena in the later game
of the CCHA Tournament semi-
finals Friday night, there will be
more than a trip to the conference
championship game on the line.
While the Wolverines are play-
ing in their 22nd consecutive
CCHA semifinal game, the Bron-
cos haven't won a semifinal game
since 1986. Michigan is fighting
for the last No.lseed in the NCAA
Tournament. Western Michigan
is hoping to secure its own NCAA
Tournament bid with a win. And
the Broncos are one of the last
three teams in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, according to USCHO.com's
latest bracketology predictions.
"They're a quick, sneaky team
- I don't know how to describe
them any other way," senior
forward Louie Caporusso said.
"They're a much different team
than the ones we've played in the
last three years. We're definitely
not taking them lightly."
The good news for the Wolver-
ines is that Caporusso, who has 18
points in 18 games in his career at
Joe Louis Arena, is back from a
lower-body injury that kept him
outofthe final game of the regular
season and in last weekend's series
against Bowling Green. Capo-
russo is playing with Hagelin and
sophomore forward Chris Brown
- a line that was red-hot, prior
to Caporusso's injury. Though
Caporusso will return this week-
end, Michigan will be without its
second-leading scorer. Junior for-
ward David Wohlberg sustained a
season-ending collarbone injury
against Bowling Green last Friday.
And while the Wolyerines have
had to deal with injuries of late,
the Broncos (10-9-9-5, 18-11-10)
will see the return of freshman
forward Shane Berschbach, who
was third on the team in points
before suffering a knee injury.

"I don't know if there is any
advantage to anyone," Berenson
said. "They've got one of their best
forwards (Berschbach), he's one
of their top scorers. But he didn't
play that weekend. And he's back
now. Now we're without Wally, so
they're a in a little better health
than we are. It's a big game at the
Joe, and we've got tobe ready for
it, no matter who we play."
The Wolverines completed
their sweep of Bowling Green
relatively easily - defeating the
Falcons 5-1 on Friday and 4-1 on
Saturday - while Western Michi-
gan battled to win two-of-three
from Ferris State.
But the mentality for both
teams switches this weekend,
as the best-of-three quarterfinal
series' are behind them and they
turn up the intensity in a winner-
moves-on semifinal matchup.
Notre Dame and Miami will
play in the earlier semifinal
tonight, with the winner advanc-
ing to the championship and the
other to meet the loser of Michi-
gan/Western Michigan on Satur-
day afternoon.
This will be the Wolverines'
fourth game at the Joe this sea-
son, but it willbe the Broncos first.
Skating under two banners adorn-
ing its name - the CCHA champi-
onship banner from last year and
the Great Lakes invitational ban-
ner from this season - Michigan
hopes its familiarity and success
in downtown Detroit will be an
advantage.
"We like playing there, we can
play there," Berenson said. "We've
had success there. But in the
meantime, it still comes down to
onegameand havingagoodgame.
You know you're going to play two
games down there and you know
you're going to play Notre Dame
or Miami no matter what. We've
got to elevate our game."

Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl is under criticism after misleading investigators about a recruiting barbeque he hosted.

This may be his last game as the
Volunteers' head coach. Pearl's
position is currently under
review after having recruits
over to his house for a barbecue
and then misleading investiga-
tors on who was involved.
The Wolverines (20-13 over-
all, 9-9 Big Ten) won the most
recent matchup the two teams
had, 87-52 on Dec. 2 1985. But
nobody who will take the court
this Friday when these two
teams rematch would have been
born yet and Pearl's distractions
didn't exist then.
With Michigan trailingbehind
the Volunteers with an all-time
4-5 record, the Wolverines will
get a chance on Friday to advance
out of the first round of the
NCAA Tournament for the sec-
ond time since Michigan coach
John Beilein took the helm.
Michigan has been playing
arguably as hot as any other
team in the country. After start-
ing the Big Ten season 1-6, the
Wolverines won nine of their
last 13 games to propel them into
the Tournament as an eighth
seed.

Michigan disappoints, falls to After promising
EMU in first round of WNIT start, season ends on
a sour note for Blue

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
YPISLANTI - The Michigan
women's basketball team went
into the WNIT as a clear favor-
ite after-
narrowly MICHIGAN 59
missing EMU 67
the NCAA
Tournament. The Wolverines fin-
ished third in the Big Ten, their
best regular-season finish in 10
years and were expected to com-
pete with anyone. Even though
Michigan would not have a single
home game because of renova-
tions to Crisler arena, it still had
high expectations.
But just like that, the tourna-
ment - and the season - is over
for the Wolverines.
Michigan (10-6 Big Ten, 17-13
overall) took a short seven-mile
bus ride to Ypsilanti and was
upset in the first round of the
WNIT by Eastern Michigan,
67-59 on Thursday.
Sophomore forward Rachel
Sheffer led the team with 20
points, but after a while, the con-
tinuous beating she and the rest
of the Wolverine post players
received started to take a toll. The
Eagles (10-6 MAC, 23-12 overall)
played a tough, physical game
and didn't allow any easy buckets
down low.
"We got outplayed. In physi-
cal games we don't do very well,"
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
said after the game. "They came
out and came after us, and they
'out physicalled' us tonight."
The staple of the Wolverines'
offense is making 3-point shots
that are set up from working
into the post. But even when the

YPSILANTI - This was the
year the Michigan women's bas-
ketball team was supposed to defy
all odds. Though the Wolverines
finished the season just 17-13 over-
all, their season was marked by a
number of outstanding feats and
record-breakingstatistics.
Michigan started off its Big Ten
season 2-0 for the first time since
the 1999-2000 season, after riding
a hot-streak of three consecutive
wins against ranked opponents -
including then-No. 24 Boston Col-
lege, No. 12 Ohio State and No. 14
Iowa. Michigan then went on to.
sweep the Buckeyes for the first
time in 10 years with a last min-
ute comeback win on the road. But
within the past four days, the Wol-
verines failed to grab an at-large
bid to the NCAA Tournament and
then lost 67-59 in the first round of
the WNIT to Eastern Michigan.
After coming into the postseason
as one of 31 teams selected with an
automatic bid, Michigan was sent
home in round one. Needlessto say,
Michigan was expected to win. In
fact, the Wolverines were a poten-
tial contender for the WNIT final.
"I mean it was a roller coaster,"
senior guard Veronica Hicks said
after the game. "The seasons are
full of ups and downs. Somebody
said something about peaking too
soon, and so I guess we maybe hit
a hot streak a little early."
After such a promising start to
the season, Michigan can't help but
wonder what led to its gradual fall-
out near the end of conference play
- a slump that was all-but exacer-
bated in post-season play.
In the final month of the sea-
son, the Wolverines went 4-6. That
included two losses to Minnesota,

a home-court stomping by Penn
State and a 55-47 loss to Illinois,
the 11th-ranked teaminthe confer-
ence, in the second round ofthe Big
Ten Tournament.
According to Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth, his team simply
didn't have the defensive game
that it needed to succeed down the
stretch.
"Defensively we're not really a
team that can impose our will on
other teams, and Ithink that really
hurts us," Borseth said. "That's
where our recruiting has to go - to
get kids who can guard, so we can
at least, on one end of the court; be
a lot better."
The Wolverines did have their
high moments defensively, includ-
ing against Ohio State when Michi-
gan held four-time Big Ten Player
of the Year Jantel Lavender to a
career-low 10 points. But the Wol-
verines ranked 10th in the confer-
ence in rebounding defense and
allowed their opponents an aver-
age of 62 points per game. And
Michigan's season was plagued by
a handful of embarrassing losses
to inferior teams like Marquette,
Detroit, Minnesota and Illinois.
"It was very frustrating before a
game trying to figure out how we
were going to match up - who was
goingto match up with who - and
we just gave up too many points
this year," Borseth said. "We gave
up too many easy baskets and the
games like this right here, when
your defense should be able to step
up and dominate."
With Hicks as the sole senior to
graduate from the squad, Michigan
has promise to come back next sea-
son with a strong, young team. But,
as a lesson learned from this sea-
son, the Wolverines will need to be
careful with wheretheir promising
'looks will take them.

talize. Michigan shot just 19 per-
cent from the field, including 15
percent in the second half against
the Eagles.
"We just have to be good with
the ball, and all-in-all it's about
putting it into the hole, and that's
the bottom line," senior guard
Veronica Hicks said. "We were
getting good looks and they had
to go in."
The key to Eastern Michigan's
game plan is forcing turnovers.
The Eagles were able to do just
that against the Wolverines, forc-
ing 19 turnovers. And down the
stretch when Michigan desper-
ately needed a bucket, the Eagles
forced a couple key turnovers,
sealing the game.
Eastern Michigan also scored
14 points in transition, often tak-
ing the momentum back from
Michigan right after it scored a

big bucket. Before tonight, the
Wolverines talked a lot about
sticking to what it's good at, but
the Eagles were able to control
the tempo and control the game.
"When the game is fast and
physical, we just didn't do very
well this year," Borseth said. "And
that's how this game is played."
Michigan played solid defense
on the perimeter, forcing a lot of
bad shots. It's interior play wasn't
as good, allowing a lot of easy.
buckets underneath. The Wol-
verines defense deteriorated as
the game went on, as the Eagles'
physical style of play began wear
Michigan down. As open shot
after open shot failed to go in
for Michigan, the offense's inef-
fectiveness began to affect the
defense.
"We had some really good
looks and just couldn't buy a bas-

ket," Borseth said. "Around the
hole, from the outside, I mean,
you have to be able to make bas-
kets. Sooner or later your defense
is goingto cave in."
Whether it was the Eagles
physicality, Michigan not being
able to hit a shot or the Eagles'
green uniforms giving them an
extra lucky spark on Saint Pat-
rick's Day, it put a disappointing
damper on a Wolverines season
- a season that started off with
great promise. Michigan will
be forced to watch the rest of
the tournament from home, and
Hicks - the emotional backbone
of the Wolverines - will never
put on a Michigan jersey again.
"Right now it's just very emo-
tional," Borseth said. "It's very
just, sick. I don't know what the
word is for it ... I just don't think
we played'well."
