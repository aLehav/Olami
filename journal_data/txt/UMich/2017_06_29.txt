Leaders of top universities 
discuss societal “compact”

Schlissel emphasizes 
need to communicate 
public benefits of 
university research

By EDUARDO BATISTA

Daily Staff Reporter

On 
Monday 
afternoon, 
the 

University of Michigan hosted 
leaders from nine of the world’s 
most highly ranked universities 
to discuss the public role of 
research 
universities 
for 
the 

ongoing celebration of the school’s 
Bicentennial.

The event, titled “The Evolving 

Bargain 
Between 
Research 

Universities and Society,” was 
the third conversation in a series 
of colloquia hosted by University 
President Mark Schlissel. It is 
following “The Future University 
Community” 
from 
January, 

which 
featured 
U.S. 
Supreme 

Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 
and a discussion with four former 

University presidents in April on 
the topic of research.

The event featured a prelude 

performance by students from the 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
and 
introductory 
remarks 
by 

Presidential Bicentennial Professor 
Paul Courant, who is also the 
interim provost, and then Schlissel 
himself.

Schlissel 
emphasized 
the 

importance of the gathering to 
advance discussions on research 
that will hopefully benefit society in 
the future.

“For the University of Michigan 

200th year we are looking forward 
with purpose in examining the 
future of higher education and of 
our society,” he said. “Here for what 
I believe is an unprecedented public 
conversation are leaders from nine 
of the world’s top Universities, 
participants of the Board of the 
Tanner Lectures on Human Values 
… Our challenge here as leaders is 
to develop the right narrative to 
explain our missions to citizens and 
society.”

Following Schlissel’s remarks, 

moderator 
Ruth 
Simmons, 

President 
Emeritus 
of 
Brown 

University, facilitated discussions 
focusing on three specific topics: 
the role of free speech on campus, 
affordability of education and the 
responsibility of universities to 
promote social mobility.

Each university leader discussed 

a specific topic related to the public 
role of research universities and 
their interactions with society.

Leszek 
Borysiewicz, 
Vice-

Chancellor of the University of 
Cambridge, 
argued 
universities 

should not deter freedom of speech 
in detriment of celebrating different 
ideas. Borysiewicz first noted there 
is a special relationship between 
universities and the public.

“My view from over the pond, if 

you like, is that you are quite right 
that there is a compact between 
society and universities,” he said. “It 
is one that is entirely built on trust, 
and that we as institutions have to 
understand that society that gives 
us our rights or licenses. If we forget 
that, we are in great difficulties.”

awards for 

community service 

and excellence 

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

The 
MStaff200 
Bicentennial 

Celebration Event, kicked off early 
Tuesday 
morning 
with 
tents, 

activities 
and 
recognitions 
of 

University of Michigan staff and 
faculty, past and present. Hundreds 
gathered on the Diag and Ingalls 
Mall for the event, which marked 
the second day of the Summer 
Festival after Monday’s Bicentennial 
Colloquium.

Several speakers took to the steps 

of Hatcher Graduate Library to 
address the crowd.

Gary Krenz, executive director of 

the University’s Bicentennial, opened 
the event and acknowledged the 
essential work of faculty. 

“We have a really vibrant, fun set 

of activities ahead of us today, all 
developed by staff, in recognition 
of staff contributions over the 
University’s 200 years,” he said. “To 
make that complex entity (that is U 
of M) function requires partnership 
with a lot of people who are operating 
at the very highest level, and that, of 
course, is our dedicated University of 
Michigan staff.”

Laurita Thomas, associate vice 

president for Human Resources, 
worked to create the MStaff200 
event. She thanked the over 600 
volunteers, faculty and staff who 
committed to facilitating activities 
throughout the day.

Washtenaw County Democrats organize 
to promote communication, voter turnout

Event was intended 
to steer Democrats 

toward more 

effective canvassing

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

About 40 Washtenaw County 

residents gathered Sunday afternoon 
at the Washtenaw County Learning 
Resource Center for an event titled 
Mobilizing 
for 
Michigan: 
2017 

Listening Tour Launch. The event, 
led by the Precinct Organizing 
Committee 
of 
the 
Washtenaw 

County Democratic Party, aimed 
to organize residents from county 
precincts to canvass effectively 
and communicate better with local 
Democratic voters.

Catherine Daligga, a vice chair for 

the Precinct Organizing Committee, 
said the event is meant to encourage 
community members to listen to 
their neighbors, act upon their 
concerns and volunteer to canvass 
locally.

“Our objective today is to start 

grouping people geographically so 
that we can use a team approach to 

talk to people in the neighborhoods, 
listen to what people have to say 
about their reactions to the 2016 
election and start to serve as a 
reliable conduit of information back 
and forth from the people in the 
community to elected officials and 
to the Democratic Party, and vice 
versa,” she said.

She 
noted 
in 
recent 
years, 

canvassing and reaching voters 
has been based on Big Data 
and 
technology 
instead 
of 

communication.

“To do it, it’s a relatively novel 

approach in some ways, because 
we’ve been relying on Big Data for 
a while, but the personal touch 
is indispensable,” she said. “The 
politics is based on relationships. If 
we foster good relationships, then 
we’ll be stronger.”

The Listening Tour itself will 

consist of acquiring 65,000 contacts 
— Democratic voters in Washtenaw 
County — by the end of 2017, by way 
of volunteers who will canvass and 
reach out to their communities.

Daligga opened the event and 

explained 
the 
importance 
of 

precinct-based organizing, as well 
as the plans for the Listening Tour. 
She said Washtenaw County needs 
to improve their voter turnout.

“We’ve done remarkably well in 

the county for keeping our turnout 
better than it has been in some 
places, and yet it’s still true that our 
turnout is not as good as it could 
be and we still have a noticeable 
fall-off in the non-presidential 
elections,” she said. “To this end, 
precinct organizing is the key.”

Precincts refer to the smallest 

political units in the American 
electoral system, and they are 
represented 
by 
one 
or 
more 

precinct delegates. These delegates 
serve as a primary link between 
residents and their party, and 
according to Daligga, a strong 
precinct organization generally 
corresponds to a much better voter 
turnout.

Daligga 
emphasized 
the 

importance 
of 
community 

relations to be fostered by the 
Listening Tour.

“Over and over and over again, 

study after study shows that the 
most effective way to mobilize 
voters is to talk to people, and to 
talk to people face to face, not on 
the phone, not online, not through 
emails — it’s remarkable,” she said.

Daligga noted Hillary Clinton 

lost the 2016 election in Michigan 
by 2.2 votes per precinct. She said 
the Democratic Party has failed 
to organize people and has only 
served in the context of specific 
political parties.

“The party has existed really as 

an adjunct in many ways to political 

parties,” she said. “It’s had the loss 
of an independent existence in 
terms of organizing people. That’s 
what we’re here for today.”

Daligga noted 2017 is not nearly 

as intense in terms of political 
campaigning as are presidential 
election years, and so it should 
serve as an opportunity to regroup 
and improve upon the situation the 
party found itself in last year.

With regard to reaching 65,000 

residents, Daligga said the number 
may seem staggering, but it is 
definitely possible.

“The closer we get to that goal, 

the more we grow the number of 
people that are willing to take on 
a few people to talk to, the farther 
ahead we have ever been,” she said. 
“Our objective is to aim to recruit 
people to go talk to their neighbors, 
serve as a community liaison and 
resource, and socialize — get to 
know each other.”

She emphasized the importance 

of not just asking people for money 
and votes but really listening to 
their concerns and transforming 
those concerns into actions.

Washtenaw 
County 
resident 

John Erdevig also addressed the 
group, speaking on his experience 
as a canvasser. He noted the 
importance of asking people to 
refer their neighbors and friends to 
gain a stable foundation of voters.

At first gathering of Michigan Trump Republicans, 
supporters pass out “training cards” for reelection

Organizers stress 
duty to defend 

Trump amid rising 

unpopularity

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

More than 50 people showed up 

to Avery’s Tavern in Rochester Hills 
Monday night to attend a meet-
ing hosted by the Michigan Trump 
Republicans, intended to train sup-
porters of President Donald Trump 
on how to most effectively promote 
his agenda and win his reelection in 
2020. The Oakland County stop was 
the first of several the organization 
has planned this summer through-
out the lower peninsula.

At the meeting, as well as on the 

organization’s website, organizers 
emphasized the amount of opposi-
tion Trump faces, saying it was their 
duty to defend him.

“Learn how you can get involved 

to help fight back against the fake 
news and the establishment that 
wants to bring down our great Presi-

dent,” the website reads. “At our 
meetings you will hear the most cur-
rent talking points directly from the 
White House that will embolden you 
to speak up and defend President 
Trump!”

The event was run by Meshawn 

Maddock and Diane Schindlbeck, 
who both served as delegates to 
the Republican National Conven-
tion last year. Both have been vocal 
supporters and organizers for the 
Trump campaign and administra-
tion in Michigan. Schindlbeck said 
one of their main challenges as orga-
nizers was figuring out what mes-
sage to promote.

“After November came, people 

still looked to Meshawn and I, as 
leaders throughout our own com-
munity and throughout the state, 
wanting to know, ‘What do you 
think Trump’s doing today? Was 
that a good choice? Was that a bad 
choice?’ “ she said. “So Meshawn 
and I would sit back and we’d say, 
‘Gosh, we believe this is what Trump 
is wanting us to say and what Trump 
is wanting us to do, but how do we 
truly get his real message out there?’ 
“

According 
to 
Schindlbeck, 

though, that task became easier 

when they were contacted by a 
“regional director” from the White 
House.

“This gentleman called us, and he 

said that he appreciates our efforts 
throughout the campaign, and he 
would like us to be a part of a team 
here in Michigan and to be the eyes 
and ears on the ground,” she said. 
“Every day we receive an update on 
what’s Trump’s agenda for the day 
and great things he has been doing 
with his administration. And it’s our 
job to get that out to you.”

Though Maddock said she hoped 

to bring the regional director to meet 
with Trump supporters in Michigan 
soon, she said she was not at liberty 
to disclose his name or any other 
information about him.

Glenn Clark, a District Chair for 

what was formerly Michigan’s 9th 
Congressional District and Repub-
lican precinct delegate from Troy, 
told the audience they had to be 
willing to engage in open forums in 
left-leaning media outlets to spread 
Trump’s message and asking them 
to become “Trump first responders.”

“What does the left always do 

without regard for anything else?” 
he said. “They always push their 
agenda. So I don’t care if it’s Mitch

Albom in the afternoon. I just listened 
to him today — he said some cocka-
mamie things. Guess what — it’s good 
to be on his show, call in and say, ‘I’m 
sorry, Mitch. You’re wrong. Here’s 
why.’ “

Maddock didn’t express the same 

level of faith in the media, however. 
Dismissing criticism of Trump as fake 
news, she advised the audience to carry 
“Trump training cards” she had made, 
containing talking points on Trump’s 
agenda.

“Does anybody ever get frustrated 

— you’re standing in line at Walmart, 
and the guy behind you is complaining 
about something Trump just did?” she 
said. “And it’s all fake news. This is the 
way to combat fake news.”

Maddock’s husband Matt Maddock, 

who unsuccessfully ran for Michigan 
state senate in 2014 and is considering 
a run for state office in 2018, also spoke 
at the meeting, said Trump support-
ers would have to fight back attacks 
from within their own party to secure 
Trump’s reelection in 2020. Emphasiz-
ing the importance of electing Trump 
supporters as precinct delegates, he 
asked how many there were in the audi-
ence — about 20 hands shot up.

“There are unfortunately a lot of 

Republicans within our own party that 

are gonna be working behind the scenes 
to put up a challenger against President 
Trump in 2020,” he said. “Remember, 
we have an electoral college. The del-
egates are the people that are in charge 
of that whole process. And the more 
Trump Republicans we get as delegates, 
the better chance we’re gonna have 
to hold strong in 2020 to combat this 
attack that’s gonna be coming toward 
Trump.”

The last person to speak at the meet-

ing was Jarvis Williams, a volunteer 
with Secure Michigan, a political orga-
nization dedicated to opposing refugee 
resettlement in Michigan. Handing out 
cards that read “I’m a Shariaphobe,” 
Williams said the organization was 
opposed to Sharia law rather than Mus-
lim people.

“We are involved in the educational 

process here to help Trump ultimately 
reduce the amount of people coming 
into our country that we call Sharia,” he 
said. “If you fall back on the comments 
that are made in the press today, and 
you make any comment about Islam or 
Muslims, you’re an Islamophobe. Even 
a good Muslim has a hard time standing 
up for Sharia.”

After the words “good Muslim,” 

however, a member of the audience 
interjected, “There’s no such thing!”

He then explained universities 

are sometimes the conduit for 
conveying what might not otherwise 
be heard.

“However, universities are also 

charged with something else, in 
many parts of the world, with 
speaking unpalatable truths, even 
though society might not want to 
hear it,” he said. “This is where often 
conversations become extremely 
difficult. A university is by definition 
not a safe space. It can not be, 
because we value the freedom of 
speech of our academics to address a 
range of issues … and to not debate is 
the worst thing a university can do.”

Nicholas B. Dirks, Chancellor 

of the University of California, 
Berkeley, contextualized Berkeley’s 
history surrounding freedom of 
speech and noted the issue the 
university had with safe spaces. In 
April, at the University of California, 
Berkeley, 
political 
commentator 

Ann Coulter’s speech was canceled 
due to threats of violence against her 

— an incident that fostered heated 
debates regarding the right to free 
speech.

“Of course, Berkeley has always 

been at the epicenter of discussions 
regarding free speech, after all we 
invented free speech on American 
campuses for public universities in 
1964,” Dirks said. “There are some 
differences between then and now, 
but the similarities are quite stark, 
in that in my university, this has 
become a highly politicized issue. 
For the Ann Coulter (event) we got 
credible threats, both from the far 
left, as well as from the far right. 
So we clearly had a problem with 
promoting a safe space for her to 
speak, in the literal sense.”

In addition to discussing the 

role of universities in promoting 
freedom of speech, participants 
also explained their views on future 
affordability 
of 
education 
and 

financial aid for all students.

Speakers on this topic included 

Drew Gilpin Faust, President of 
Harvard University, and David 
Ibbetson, President of University of 
Cambridge, among others.

and return to your jobs later today 
or tomorrow with understanding 
who makes blue ‘go,’ who makes 
an incredible difference with your 
ideas, your innovation, and the 
work that you do every day,” she 
said.

Kevin Hegarty, executive vice 

president 
and 
chief 
financial 

officer, spoke to faculty and staff 
and announced a new award to be 
launched in October.

“It’s important that we celebrate 

your effort, skills, innovation and

impactful way, which is why we 
felt it was important to bolster 
our 
University-wide

Hegarty said Thomas reached out 

to the Voices of the Staff, an employee 
engagement program at the University, 
to create a rewards and recognition 
task force with members from the 
campus and Michigan Medine.

OPINION

T

he first time that I ever 
found a spider in my house, 
after a bit of screaming and 

running around and yelling for my 
mom, we eventually caught it in a jar 
and set it free outside. And except 
under dire circumstances, I still try 
to make sure the little guys, and gals, 
make it out alive.

Which is why when the Daily’s 

Editorial Board first discussed 
the deer cull — a city-wide plan to 
manage the deer populations by 
hiring sharpshooters to kill, and 
now sterilize, deer — I was adamant 
that a deer cull was entirely wrong 
in any circumstance. It was an 
issue I saw as framed as one of 
convenience for humans, and I 
believed that was wrong. The 
deer were here before humans, we 
built on their land, we’re driving 
on their land, so we shouldn’t 
have the authority to kill them — 
especially since the deer cannot 
defend themselves against it. And 
at the time, the Editorial Board 
was almost completely divided, so 
we didn’t take a formal stance on 
the issue. 

Last fall, when it came time to 

endorse a candidate for a contested 
city council seat, I was wary of the 
fact that one of the candidates, 
Chuck 
Warpehoski, 
was 
an 

outspoken proponent of the cull. 
Having been a staunch opponent 
of the cull up to that point, I really 
struggled with the fact that it 
was one of the issues he explicitly 
approved of. Nonetheless, because 
we believed he was, overall, the 
stronger candidate of two, I, along 
with the majority of the Editorial 
Board, voted to endorse him.

Through various interviews, 

we learned Warpehoski was 
an environmentalist, and his 
support for the deer cull was 
one that came from an ecological 
standpoint. The overpopulation 
of deer is a problem for people 

and drivers, but more crucially 
it is making Ann Arbor less 
ecologically diverse, as we have 
removed their natural predators. 
So, when the Editorial Board 
finally decided to try, again, to 
take a stance on the deer cull last 
winter, as I looked around the 
room, I could see how framed in a 
new light, with new information 
in hand (via Warpehoski), the 
deer cull made more sense to 
some people than it had before 
— it definitely made more sense 
to me. In the end, the vast 
majority of the Editorial Board 
voted to endorse the deer cull. If 
we are given more information 
on divisive issues, it may help 
different sides get their points 
across better. 

In a recent interview, City 

Council candidate for Ward 1, Anne 
Bannister, cited transparency as a 
primary campaign platform. And 
it should be, as I believe it is one 
of the most important things for a 
public official to work toward — yet 
it is one that many still fail to reach 
because goals that are viewed 
as more “tangible” seem to take 
priority. But I believe this is one 
of the most crucial issues. While 
Bannister was speaking more 
broadly about the need for citizens 
to trust their representatives, it got 
me thinking about how important 
transparency is, not only from 
elected officials, but also at the 
more personal level.

In this case, I saw very clearly 

how Warpehoski’s transparency 
when it came to why he supported 
the deer cull made me less wary of 
him, less wary of the cull and more 
able to see a side I had originally 
thought was completely wrong. 
Being able to more thoroughly 
understand the issue also had an 
impact on Bannister, who says in 
her interview, though an animal 
lover who believes animals should 

always be “treated with respect,” 
she realized the deer cull was 
necessary for rebalancing the 
ecology of Ann Arbor — an ecology 
that us, humans, unbalanced. She 
cited information she learned 
from Washtenaw Citizens for 
Ecological Balance.

There 
needs 
to 
be 
more 

Warpehoskis in public office, 
more Bannisters who take the 
time to explain their stances. 
Answers like ‘yes’ and ‘no,’ 
‘wrong’ and ‘right,’ only go 
so far and can shut down a 
conversation in a split second. 
Once I better understood the 
issue of the deer cull as not 
just 
about 
inconveniences 

for drivers, but as an issue of 
ecological imbalance — since 
humans eliminated their natural 
predator, the wolf — I could 
make a more informed decision. I 
could better evaluate arguments 
on each side of the issue. And 
even just between two friends 
or coworkers, transparency can 
often be key to allowing another 
person to understand your side.

That’s not to say I will change 

my mind every time I hear 
another side of an issue, and 
when it comes to protecting 
wildlife, supporting the deer 
cull is a pretty big exception. (If 
you look at my sad excuse for a 
Twitter account, you’ll see it’s 
mostly videos of baby animals.) 
But there is a problem, and the 
problem lies with not having 
access to the other side. Someone 
saying that they approve of x, or 
that they don’t like y, without 
an explanation, doesn’t lead to 
a conversation — more likely, it 
becomes two people who may 
now be angry at each other 
because they don’t understand 
the other side. Of course, if you’re 
trying to shove your viewpoint 
down someone’s throat, even

Start a conversation 

if you have all the facts in the 
world, it won’t matter. But simply 
explaining why you see the 
issue one way, without trying to 
persuade the other side, could 
have an effect.

It’s true, we shouldn’t have 

to give a reason for every single 
little thing we do in life, and 
there are tactical reasons not to 
talk about every little thing we 
plan to do, but when they impact 
many different people or they 
impact even one individual in a 
way that impacts them greatly, 
it’s important to be open to a 
discuss, to give more detailed 
reasoning. Not only when it’s 
the duty of someone in public 
office, but also, in larger part, it’s 
a simple way to make people feel 
as though you are listening and 
care that they have the tools to 
understand why a decision that 
may seemingly be inflammatory 
at first glance, is based in thought 
and fact.

We won’t always change our 

opinions, given more information 
from the other side, but there 
is almost no chance someone 
will change their mind if they 

are not even provided with the 
reasoning of the other side, we 
will almost never change our 
opinions. 
For 
many 
people 

who aren’t well informed on 
the issue, it’s hard to not look 
at something like a deer cull as 
completely unnecessary, another 
blow to our already endangered 
wildlife. So, I implore our elected 
officials, University of Michigan 
administration and any and all 
other actors of change, to just 
explain. Not simply disseminate 
pamphlets, 
or 
hope 
that 

journalists will write about the 
issues and environmentalists will 
post on their websites and blogs. 
And to everyone else engaged 
in a discussion with another: if 
you make more of an effort to be 
forthright, transparent, explain 
your reasoning, who knows? You 
could just start a conversation. 
You could just have an effect.

C

urrently, it seems that 
the tumultuous political 
environment of America 

will never calm, and the news 
of Mark Zuckerberg awkwardly 
testing the waters of the potential 
presidential arena only adds 
to the absurdity of our present 
democratic state.

Zuckerberg, a thirty-three-

year-old computer programmer 
who has a net worth greater than 
the GDP of Luxembourg, is yet 
another example of the growing 
belief that billionaires are able 
to solve America’s problems by 
entering into politics and policy 
creation. Due to their massive 
financial success, we as the poor 
citizens we are should willingly 
allow for the transformation 
of our democratic system into 
an oligarchy full of benevolent 
billionaires who so generously 
bless us with their intelligence 
and talent.

This 
trend 
in 
American 

culture is the culmination of 
several factors all stemming 
from specific attributes and 
common 
desires 
we 
as 
a 

collective citizenry share. This 
trend was detailed excellently on 
a recent episode of the podcast 
“Politically 
Reactive,” 
where 

writer Naomi Klein explained 
how several of the solutions to 
the growing wealth and income 
inequality in America relied 
on the generosity of the rich, or 
“philanthro-capitalism.” 
She 

argued 
that 
throughout 
the 

1980s into present day, growing 
materialism and the idea that 
wealth 
is 
synonymous 
with 

success led to this reliance and 
idolization of the mega-rich 
within America. And despite 
this phenomenon occurring and 
growing for years, its fruitions 
have 
only 
become 
blatantly 

visible recently with the election 
of famous rich person, Donald 
Trump.

Trump, 
throughout 
the 

entirety of his celebrity life, has 
been selling a “brand” — and the 
Trump brand is all about money, 
power, success and happiness 
achieved 
essentially 
through 

material wealth. From his name 
plastered in gold on the side of 
every building he owns, to the 
fact that he is rarely ever seen in 
something other than a suit — the 
man sold the idea that his massive 
financial wealth was more than 
enough evidence that he could fix 
America’s political problems.

His 
election 
demonstrated 

that many Americans believe 
success 
within 
the 
private 

sector can translate to victories 
within America’s complicated 
and massive public bureaucracy. 
That by enabling these wealthy 
geniuses, we can allow them to 
transform and fix our country 
the same way they did to their 
company, brand or social media 
site.

As Klein stated in an interview 

with The New York Times, 
“rather than trying to solve these 
huge global problems through 
institutions with some kind of 
democracy 
and 
transparency 

baked into them, we’re just going 
to outsource it to benevolent 
billionaires.” 
From 
the 

billionaires who own charitable 

foundations 
to 
unregulated 

political contributions — the 
mega-rich have been entrusted to 
serve our best interests crafting 
policy and changing the political 
landscape. And most of these 
actions go unnoticed by the public, 
mostly through the privately-
run 
charitable 
organizations 

which are controlled by only a 
few individuals whose policies, 
viewpoints 
and 
politics 
are 

often unknown to those outside 
these groups. The Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation alone 
determines many policies for 
public education in America, free 
from citizen input and comment. 

And what this trend is doing 

is undermining our American 
democracy. Essentially, we are 
creating 
a 
pseudo-oligarchy 

in which money and material 
wealth dictate public policy in 
America. We do so willingly with 
the current political campaign 
finance laws, the allowance of 
massive lobbying firms to draft 
laws and the ongoing idolization 
of the super-rich. Our democracy 
is 
meant 
to 
function 
with 

public input and participation 
on all levels, in which our 

statesmen 
and 
women 
are 

empathetic citizens representing 
constituents 
they 
truly 

understand. Willingly sacrificing 
our political input and interest 
to a handful of billionaires who 
we have come to believe are 
more intelligent, empathetic and 
qualified 
than 
contemporary 

political operatives undermines 
the communal political actions 
that are central to American 
democracy.

This obsession and idolization 

of the wealthy has begun to 
seriously jeopardize the overall 
strength of our democracy. The 
solution to the level of growing 
inequality is not the gracious 
donations of billionaires who 
take time to step away from their 
business and into the positions 
of public office. Historically, 
America has been plagued before 
by gross levels of inequality in 
which wealthy families wielded 
massive control over the politics 
of the time. The Rockefellers, 
Vanderbilts and Morgans of the 
past shaped political and public 
policy to bend toward their 
interests. From atop their golden 
estates, they were thought to 
grace the working public with 
their 
immense 
knowledge 

and wealth during a time in 
which inequality had reached a 
historical high.

And now, the robber barons 

of the past have been replaced 
by the tech and finance titans of 
the present. Gates, Zuckerberg, 
Bezos or Trump — regardless, 
their 
wealth 
has 
somehow 

justified the assurance that they 
can change America, they can fix 
its problems.

Billionaires and the super 

wealthy are obviously intelligent 
and 
their 
accomplishments 

impressive. 
Whether 
they 

created 
luxury 
hybrid 
cars, 

built 
massive 
fortunes 
in 

investments or decided whether 
Joan Rivers or Dennis Rodman 
would make a better “celebrity 
apprentice” for a hypothetical 
company that will never exist — 
billionaires’ accomplishments are 
complemented by their immense 
wealth. Yet that wealth should not 
serve as an automatic guarantee 
that they understand and can 
solve the complex political issues 
facing the country.

Benevolent billionaires

W

ith the campus population 
so much sparser in the 
summer, it’s easy to spot 

differences among passing crowds. For 
the past few weeks, a certain species 
could not go unnoticed walking the 
Diag and roaming State Street.

They travel in packs, wearing bulky 

lanyards around their necks and 
excessive University of Michigan gear 
fresh out of their swinging M Den 
bags. They make me chuckle, because 
just one year ago, I was one of them: 
unsure of my whereabouts, excited and, 
ironically, disoriented — an orientation 
kid.

Now, it’s hard to believe that I 

had once been so unfamiliar with 
this university. Exactly one year ago, 
trekking from the holy East Quad 
with eyes glued to Google Maps, I 
was worn out by high school, nervous 
and uncertain about my future. I was 
lost, both literally and figuratively, 
and entirely unaware of who I was to 
become.

Yet, as I watch their confusion and 

excitement, I can practically relive 
the freshness of orientation, almost 
longing to be on that momentous brink 
of change again. While the details are 
fuzzy, my memories of orientation 
stand out collectively as a distinct feeling 
of novelty, marked by an independence 
that I couldn’t yet comprehend.

Coming from a reserved suburban 

household, a number of things shocked 
me those two days. Having been told 
that I would never escape my “high 
school circle” in college, I was amazed 
by the amount of unfamiliar faces 
and even more so by the expectation 
of befriending them. Just a few days 
after graduation, I wasn’t ready to leave 
behind petty notions of high school 
cliques and the social taboo of simply 
approaching someone outside of my 
own social group.

In essence, I couldn’t imagine ever 

being confident or comfortable enough 
to reach out to others my own age, much 
less be surrounded by them day and 
night for the next four years. As a result, 
my social interaction at orientation was 
restricted to a grand total of one friend 
— a high school classmate, of course. 
But while I still regret not branching out 
earlier, it didn’t stop me from having fun 
for those two days.

The orientation high I’ll always be 

able to remember is the sheer taste of 
freedom — that I perhaps now take 
for granted. Having been accustomed 
to strict parents for the first 18 years of 
my life, I couldn’t fathom the ease with 
which I could roam about campus, stay 
up until 2 a.m. or spend money without 
consequence.

But as I attended informational 

lectures and scheduled my very first 
classes, I felt the same fear we all did: 
was I ready for college classes? Would 
I even find them? What will I have 
advanced in my career a year from now, 
next summer?

Remembering this, I couldn’t help 

but smile — out of amusement, because 
I recall so clearly that anxiety that had 
plagued me exactly 12 months ago, but 
also out of appreciation, because I never 
would’ve pictured myself as the person 
I am today.

We are told not to live in the past, 

but growth cannot be measured in the 
absence of reflection.

Following that eventful orientation, 

my first year of college was, as it is for all 
of us, marked by countless milestones, 
or “firsts”: first stranger to become a 
best friend, first independent decision, 
first all-night study session, first full-
time job — the list goes on and on.

Over time, my firsts turned into 

standards and my naïve freshman self 
grew into an individual. Though the 
point at which I crossed into adulthood 
is difficult to define, the difference in 
my maturity is distinct. A year ago, 
I would have hardly believed that I 
could converse readily with strangers 
or even stray far enough from home 
that I would encounter one. I would’ve 
dismissed the reality of financial 
independence, and I was terrified of an 
impending career that I’ve learned only 
hard work can pay for.

But somewhere along the line, I 

proved myself wrong. With uncertainty 
and challenge, I have grown into a 
better version of myself — defined not 
by my high school, my family nor my 
former reservations but rather by my 
own ideas and actions that are given so 
much room for growth at this school. 
Looking back, I can attest to the rumors: 
change is good, and I’m proud of it.

So, for those of you who are long 

past your orientation days, I urge you 
to pop that dusty lanyard back on for 
one last throwback. A simple self-
reflection cannot be underestimated; 
recognizing personal growth only 
creates increased cause to advance. 
We will only keep growing.

For those of you who have yet to 

taste the freshman experience, don’t 
toss that lanyard off just yet. You’ll 
want to remember what it feels like 
around your neck; a year from now, 
you might feel completely different.

And I promise you, you don’t want 

to forget it.

Young Thug is inventive 
on recent hip hop album 

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

Ah, a man and his guitar. So 

much of the worst music of the 
last 100 years has been made by 
dudes crooning about women 
over four-chord loops. But some 
of it has been good, too. At best, 
romantic, sing-song-y guitar bal-
lads can be emotionally piercing 
and refreshingly honest; at worst, 
they can be made by guitarists 
from Illinois who go by “The 
Plain White T’s.”

Young Thug, born Jeffery Wil-

liams, is the latest of a long line 
of rappers to willfully assert 
hip-hop culture into something 
more, ahem, progressive. In his 
wake, a long line of adolescent 
weirdo-rappers with multicolor 
hair. That his latest effort, offi-
cially then unofficially titled 
Easy Breezy Beautiful Thugger 
Girls (now just Beautiful Thug-
ger Girls) would be “alternative,” 
even by his standards, has been 
a poorly kept secret over the last 

six months. Snip-
pets of album cuts 
have been in cir-
culation for years, 
and 
the 
album 

intro in particu-
lar, 
with 
Thug 

croaking in the southern drawl of 
a country singer, was clowned on 
immediately.

Less than a year ago we’d seen 

Thug mocked for donning a dress 
on the cover of Jeffery, and now, 
he returns with even greater 
style — this time, with a guitar. 

He joins a relatively short list of 
MCs who’ve survived near-fatal 
encounters with the instrument; 
recent survivors include André 
3000, Lil Wayne, Kid Cudi and, 
I guess, Frank Ocean too. All are 
revolutionary Black male rapper-
singer-songwriters who blur gen-
der lines and have no regard for 
tradition; Thug is certainly not in 
bad company.

To be perfectly clear, Beautiful 

Thugger Girls is misleading. Per-
haps it’s being marketed as some 
sort of 2017 Rebirth, but it’s really 
not that much of a radical devia-
tion from Thug’s traditional album 
structure. While his earliest mix-
tapes (and even recent Slime Sea-
son installments) tend to run 
amok, Thug cleaned up his act on 
the uncharacteristically polished 
Barter 6, Jeffery and now Beautiful 
Thugger Girls. Safe to say it’s not 
uncharacteristic anymore, but the 
untamed nature of his music has 
almost permanently branded him 
with these sorts of lazy labels.

Thug’s desire to belt out in song 

was always there, and in his own 
words, this is his “singing album.” 
He mainly sings about sex. Sex, 
to Young Thug, is like cocaine to 
Pusha T; they simply never run out 
of things to say no matter how nar-
row the scope. You get the sense 
that Thug simply has too much 
emotion to express himself within 
the confines of rap, men’s fashion 
or any human language. There is 
singing, yes, but there’s a lot of rap-
ping too. There’s a lot of whatever 
you want to call what Young Thug 
has been doing for the last five 

years, really. Kanye always joked 
that 808s & Heartbreak could have 
been a country album, but Thug 
actually managed to incorporate 
acoustic sonic elements into Thug-
ger Girls while still maintaining 
his largely undefinable pop-rap 
lane.

Album-opener “Family Don’t 

Matter” sees Thug harmonize 
with breakout London vocal-
ist Millie Go Lightly, with what 
is maybe supposed to be his best 
George Strait impression. He lets 
out a “yee-haw” less than 30 sec-
onds in, and Thug actually fools us 
all into thinking this might seri-
ously be a country album. You can 
practically hear him strain his face 
to annunciate “Country Billy made 
a couple millie / Tryna park the 
Rolls Royce inside the Piccadilly.” 
But relax, there are features from 
Future and Snoop Dogg later, and 
lyrics like “‘Bouta put my d*** in 
your mouth right when you yawn.” 
Still, it’s funny to see Thug be so 
tongue-in-cheek about the whole 
idea of the album.

He takes the backseat for the 

latter half of the song, letting Mil-
lie’s sweeping vocals shine. She 
has a prominent role throughout 
the first few tracks, which feels 
appropriate for an album so fix-
ated on Thug’s relationship with 
women. She appears again on “She 
Wanna Party,” which is another 
early highlight on the first half of 
the album where Thug front-loads 
so many standout tracks.

Virginia, 1863. The Civil War is 

underway and America is a nation 
divided in more ways than North 
versus South or abolition versus slav-
ery. A country in the midst of a war 
also means the men are away fight-
ing while the women wait for their 
return. The boys are on the battle-
field, and the girls stay in the house.

Sofia Coppola’s reimagination 

of the 1971 Gothic drama, “The 
Beguiled,” offers a darkly comedic 
portrayal of life for a group of women 
during the Civil War, and just how 
complicated things get when a man 
comes into it. The film premiered 
this May at the Cannes Film Festi-
val, where it competed for the Palme 
d’Or. Though it did not win the cov-
eted award, Coppola was awarded 
“Best Director” for her work. She is 
the second female director to ever 
win this prize.

The award was well deserved. 

What makes the 2017 adaptation of 
“The Beguiled” watchable is cer-
tainly not its simple plot: an injured 
Union 
soldier, 
Corporal 
John 

McBurney, is taken in by the few 
remaining women at the Miss Mar-
tha Farnsworth Seminary for Young 
Ladies in Virginia and tensions rise 
until they boil over. Despite a plot 
identical to its 1971 predecessor, 
the 2017 adaptation tells a different 
story as a result of Coppola’s direc-
torial choices. It’s the nuanced dia-
logue, the flawless mise-en-scene, 
the subtlety of movement and the 
implications of subtext. By telling 
the story from the women’s per-

spective instead of from Corporal 
McBurney’s (as did the 1971 version), 
Coppola pivots the implications of a 
source material which can be con-
strued as misogynistic and demean-
ing towards women.

The film begins when 12-year old 

Amy (Oona Laurence, “Pete’s Drag-
on”) finds Corporal John McBurney 
(Colin Farrell, “The Lobster”) alone 
in the woods and at death’s door. She 
takes him back to the house, where 
he is begrudgingly allowed inside by 
Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman, “Big 
Little Lies”), who insists he can stay 
to heal. After he is better, they will 
— they must — hand him over to the 
Confederate soldiers. After all, they 
are good, Southern ladies. 

They might be good ladies, but 

they are ladies who have not had 
the company of anyone, much less 
an attractive young soldier, in quite 
some time. Before long, everyone in 
the house has developed some kind 
of attachment to Corporal McBur-
ney. For Amy, it is a sweet, innocent 
crush. For the shy schoolteacher 
Edwina (Kirsten 
Dunst, 
“Spider-

man”) it is deep, 
tender love. For 
the rebellious Ali-
cia (Elle Fanning, 
“20th 
Century 

Women”) it is full out lust. Corpo-
ral McBurney capitalizes on this 
and manipulates the lonely women 
as best he can, desperate to not be 
handed back over to the Confederate 
soldiers.

Underground 
French 
night 

clubs will be adding Staples to 
their rotation soon.

From inaugural major label 

EP Hell Can Wait to his most 
recent Prima Donna, No I.D. and 
ARTium label mate DJ Dahi have 
produced 90% of the tracks Vince 
Staples has released. On Big Fish 
Theory, 
Staples 
eschews 
col-

laboration with both. Instead, he 
favors electronic-heavy producers 
like Flume and SOPHIE. While 
this doesn’t spell some in-label-
under-the-table beef — the album 
was still released on No I.D.’s 
ARTium Recordings, after all — 
it highlights creative differences, 
significant differences at that.

Big Fish Theory opens with 

Justin 
Vernon-assisted 
“Crabs 

in a Bucket.” The first minute is 
spacy, thinly sliced vocals tightly 
driven between filtered, distorted 
sounds and ambient coastal noise. 
It’s hardly recognizable as a Vince 
Staples track, but when the beat 
kicks — a sweeping, garage house-
derivative kick and snare com-
posite — and when Staples spends 
two verses rapping frantically 
staccato — “put me in the MoMa 
when it’s over with / I used to look 
up to the sky, now I’m over shit” 
— it’s immediately clear that we’re 
meeting a new Vince.

Staples has long envisioned 

himself within the legion of 
hip hop’s avant-garde. On Big 
Fish Theory, he is no different. 
Yet, what he steps away from is 
the 
Lamarian 
meta-thematic, 

architectonic 
experience 
we 

saw on Summertime ’06 and 
Prima 
Donna. 
Those 
pieces 

both function and frame on the 
project-level scale: A complete 
experience calls for total con-
sumption.

Not that Big Fish Theory 

doesn’t beg to be enjoyed from 
front to back. But in those past 
projects, the music was engi-
neered around a larger motive: 
Certain emotions, certain take-
aways seemed to be demanded. 
What Big Fish Theory sees is 
Vince stepping away into much 
more amorphous territory, leav-

ing 
space 
for 
interpretation 

rather than urging the listener 
outright to some conclusion. He 
better understands that artists 
ask questions, not answer them.

On 
Big 
Fish 
Theory, 
his 

experimental tendency has con-
strained into the microscopic, 
into the minute elements of the 
single track. What’s most telling 
is his choice to release the outro 
“Rain Come Down” as a single 
more than two weeks before the 
official album drop. It’s hard to 
imagine A$AP Rocky releasing 
“Suddenly,” Danny Brown drop-
ping “Float On” or Kanye West 
surrendering “Bound 2” pre-
album. Those tracks were essen-
tial summits to the larger album 
at hand, aesthetically and emo-
tionally. It would taint the piece 
to hear it prematurely.

Not that “Rain Come Down” 

doesn’t decisively conclude the 
album. It does. The most omi-
nous bass on the album grumbles 
between sparse hi-hats, looped 
gunshots and a solemn recount 
of his hometown and emotional 
disconnect from women. Yet, 
what gets lost is this album as a 
self-contained entity.

Whether that is devolution or 

transcendence is up to the lis-
tener, I suppose.

It can’t help but seem like a 

surrender to the fact that most 
of his fans will only hear the 
singles and not 
the album. This 
comes full circle 
because beyond 
all the mention 
of 
avant-garde 

and experimen-
tation, Big Fish Theory is Vince’s 
most accessible release. For the 
first time, it seems that Staples 
has really embraced his role as 
an artist and entertainer. Not 
that he’s moved beyond social 
critique and black advocacy: 
Those ideas continue to animate 
much of this album’s lyrical con-
tent. However, the significant 
attention to money, cars and 
deviant relations with women 
does mark a major thematic shift 
in his style.

When watching “Glow,” you 

can’t help but think of its sister show 
“Orange is the New Black.” In addi-
tion to sharing the same streaming 
platform, “Glow” draws several par-
allels to “OITNB,” with its diverse 
female ensemble cast and its illus-
tration of the challenges of being a 
woman in a male-dominated sys-
tem. (It’s also no coincidence that 
“OITNB” creator Jenji Kohan exec-
utive produces “Glow” and wrote 
one of the episodes).

But while both shows share simi-

lar themes and socially conscious 
undertones, comparing the two feels 
a bit too on-the-nose, especially since 
“Glow,” though not as nuanced as 
“OITNB,” offers something entirely 
different and refreshing. Created 
by Liz Flahive (“Adult Beginners”) 
and Carly Mensch (“Nurse Jack-
ie”), “Glow” treats its audience to a 
delightful, entertaining and visually 

glossy depiction of 
the female wres-
tling world, along 
with the intrica-
cies 
of 
female 

friendship 
and 

gender dynamics. 
The Netflix series 

was based on an actual syndicated 
female wrestling circuit from the 
‘80s, but thanks to some sharp dia-
logue and inventive characters, 
“Glow” works well as a fictionalized 
origin story, breathing new life into 
its defunct source material.

The show begins with its antihe-

ro protagonist Ruth Wilder (Alison 
Brie, “The Littlest Hours”), a strug-
gling Los Angeles actress who, after 
failing an audition and reaching 
near debt, joins the Gorgeous Ladies 
of Wrestling, an emerging TV show 
that involves a group of “unconven-
tional women” acting and wrestling 
one another. Despite derision and 
doubt from her fellow G.L.O.W.-

mates and the show’s scuzzy direc-
tor Sam Sylvia (a perfectly cast 
Marc Maron, “Easy”), Ruth persists 
against the odds, even if it’s mostly 
out of desperation.

Things become more compli-

cated when Sam places Ruth’s best 
friend-turned-rival Debbie Egan 
(Betty Gilpin, “True Story”) on 
G.L.O.W., making for a predictable 
albeit intriguing and heartfelt dual 
character arc. The central focus on 
their relationship is perhaps the 
most engaging and genuine part 
about “Glow.” The troubled con-
nection they work through feels 
similar to something like the vola-
tile relationship between “Orange 
is the New Black”’s Piper and Alex, 
“Riverdale”’s Veronica and Betty 
and “Insecure”’s Issa and Molly. 
Without spoiling the truth behind 
their deeply troubled friendship, 
“Glow” deftly uses literal and figu-
rative fighting ground for Ruth and 
Debbie to resolve their issues, with 
their opposite wrestling personas 
building and simultaneously reliev-
ing tension between the two. 

Despite its glee and gusto, “Glow” 

is not as incredibly unprecedented as 
it may seem. The plot is fairly conven-
tional, the jokes are raunchy but not 
gut-busting and for the most part, 
it’s more enjoyable than thought-
provoking. However, “Glow” does 
have the potential to reach heights 
of critical grandeur, especially with 
its stellar cinematography, charm-
ing costume design, makeup and 
killer New Wave soundtrack. Most 
period shows and films try too hard 
to evoke the time period in which 
they take place through obvious 
pop culture references. Luckily, 
“Glow”’s authentic portrayal of the 
‘80s evokes the decade’s social and 
aesthetic atmosphere well enough 
that it’s neither too simplistic nor 
over-the-top.

In addition to “Glow”’s artful-

ness, the show continues to break 
ground for better and more fleshed 

out representation of women on 
television. Brie makes for a compel-
ling lead, seeing that her previous 
supporting roles on NBC’s “Com-
munity” and AMC’s “Mad Men” 
have propelled her to finally playing 
a main character perfectly suited 
for her. Similarly, Gilpin brings the 
funk and humor as Debbie, play-
ing off Brie’s energy with a sub-
dued yet dynamic performance. In 
addition to Brie and Gilpin, Sydelle 
Noel (“Everybody Hates Chris”) 
and Britney Young (“Those Who 
Can’t”) give enthralling, breakout 
performances as Cherry Bang and 
Carmen Wade, respectively. The 
two each offer both comic relief 
and genuine poignancy, even if 
their roles as supporting characters 
aren’t as amplified as much as Brie 
and Gilpin’s.

“Glow” itself triumphs as a show 

primarily because of its female cast 
and how its characters deal with 
the complexities of being sexual-
ized and stereotyped as wrestlers 
for the sake of entertainment. 
The execution of “Glow”’s sub-
versiveness sometimes comes off 
a bit shaky. At times, it just seems 
like the characters are willfully 
embracing the very stereotypes 
that suppress them into one-
dimensional people. But “Glow” 
is smart enough to recognize the 
effect the male gaze has on these 
women, and how their reclaiming 
of regressive symbols of femininity 
can be liberating and empowering.

The first few episodes are a tad 

lukewarm, plot and humor-wise — 
the pilot feels like it could be lon-
ger, and the two episodes following 
it ebb and flow between intelligent 
and meandering. But much like 
“Orange is the New Black,” “Glow” 
truly shines when it gets to the 
emotional core behind each of its 
character and the kind of personas 
they’re trying to build as wrestlers 
and as women.

Eva Feldman reflects on time at T
aubman Institute

By ALEXA ST. JOHN 

Managing NEWS EDITOR

Eva Feldman has been at the forefront 

of the University of Michigan’s stem cell 
research for decades. Since receiving her 
M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the University 
and, later, becoming director of research for 
the University Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
Clinic and director of the A. Alfred Taubman 
Medical Research Institute, Feldman has 
conducted her research with one thing in 
mind: finding a cure for ALS.

Though Feldman recently announced 

she will be stepping down from the latter 
position, 
her 
extensive 
research 
and 

numerous accomplishments as director of 
the 
Taubman 
Institute 

will not be forgotten by 
peers, mentees and — most 
importantly — her patients.

Stem 
cell 
research, 

though controversial, has 
always been a noteworthy 
point of scientific and 
medical 
innovation 

and 
development 
at 

the 
University 
despite 

pushback 
from 
human 

rights 
groups 
and 

government action.

Feldman herself has been conducting her 

research for years, starting first as a fellow at 
the University in 1987, then later joining as a 
faculty member, practicing clinical trials and 
speaking at events to stress the significance 
of stem cell research. She conducts research 
primarily on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease — a 
neurodegenerative disease which the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 
5,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with 
each year.

The creation of the Taubman Institute first 

stemmed from a unique friendship between 
Feldman and one of her early patients, 
A. Alfred Taubman. While Feldman was 
Taubman’s physician, he became more and 
more interested in medical research and 
funded her work several times.

“I said, ‘you know Alfred, we need to do 

something bigger than just me,’ ” Feldman 
said.

With the help of then-University President 

Mary Sue Coleman and other administrators, 
the Taubman was founded in 2007, aiming 
to allow researchers to pursue all avenues of 
biomedical research at the University.

“He was the world’s best patient,” Feldman 

laughed, noting Taubman even had his own 
white lab coat when visiting her lab. Feldman 
recognized his willingness to learn about her 
research and help close a gap present at the 
University in terms of this work.

Starting with just four central physician 

scientists a decade ago, the institute has 
more than 200 working researchers today, 

and while it is centered around the study 
of neurodegenerative disease, cancer and 
cardiovascular disease, researchers also 
touch on a variety of other medical research 
areas.

Feldman, who has served as director 

of the institute since its inception and is a 
Russell N. DeJong Professor of Neurology, 
said her inspiration for her research 
stems from a desire to make positive and 
impactful discoveries in neurology and 
cancer care.

“Our 
goal 
has 
always 
been 
to 

understand 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 

neurological disorders and create new 
therapies,” Feldman said, recalling the 
impact that seeing one of her first patients 
had on her. This patient was a woman — 

just a few years older than 
her at the time — who had 
ALS.

Feldman has received 

a 
number 
of 
awards 

and 
authored 
countless 

academic articles regarding 
her work — many of which 
have been acknowledged 
in medical news across the 
nation — all motivated by 
the patients and diseases 
seen.

“Starting to see patients 

when I was young … made me realize that 
this is what I wanted to do,” Feldman 
said.

The work of Feldman and her closest 

peers have also led scientists closer to 
a cure for ALS than ever. This isn’t to 
say Feldman hasn’t faced challenges, 
however 
— 
namely, 
finances. 
The 

institute was born just prior to the 2008 
recession, prompting researchers there 
to find new ways to gain access to local, 
pharmaceutical and national funding.

“There’s certainly now, at the medical 

center, a much more robust infrastructure 
to help individuals with the novel ideas 
they’ve created as Taubman scholars to 
bring them forth to the clinic,” Feldman 
said. “That’s one of the underlying tenants 
and one of the underlying visions of the 
institute, is to let a clinician scientist take 
that discovery and bring it into the clinic.”

Aside 
from 
finances, 
gaining 

recognition within the University was 
a challenge at the beginning. Now, 
however, the institute has gained national 
recognition.

Max Wicha, director of the Forbes 

Institute for Cancer Discovery and one 
of the founding scholars of the Taubman, 
attributed much of the institute’s success 
to Feldman and her dedication to medical 
treatment and innovation.

So thank you to the friends that 
taught me how to take time for 
myself, to shut off all the lights, 
watched trashy TV with me, and 
a shoutout to those that let me 
cook in their kitchens before I 
moved out of the dorms.

5. 

Get you 
some 
friends 
that 
are oak 
trees - A 
woman 
once 
said 
to 

me that 
are two 
catego-
ries 
of 

friends. 
You’ve 
got 
friends 

that are like paper and glass 
trees and you’ve got friends 
that are like oak trees. What she 
meant is that, the first group of 
friends are fine when the day 
is bright and life is nothing but 
smiles. Yet, when the storm hits, 
their support shatters, they are 
uprooted when you need them 
to be firm the most. However, 
friends who are oak trees are 
always there to support you 

to provide you cover when the 
storm hits. Not only do you need 
oak tree friends, you need to be 
an oak tree friend, because let’s 
face it, nobody likes a leech. 

6. Get you some friends that...

get you - Friends who take time 
to understand you and help you 
understand 
yourself. 
Friends 

that you feel no shame laugh-
ing wildly around and sobbing 
loudly into their shoulders. The 
ones you never have to explain 
yourself to because they lis-
tened when you told them your 
innermost fears and motiva-
tions. The ones that are your 
biggest allies as much as you 
are theirs. Friends that get. You. 
Completely. As. You. Are. 

So in essence, shoutout to all 

of these friends, my chosen fam-
ily. Whether we became best 
friends after one semester or 
our friendship grew stronger 
throughout our four years, thank 
you. Your friendship strength-
ened my resiliency and made 
navigating my identities as a 
woman of colour on the Univer-
sity’s campus feel less difficult 
— you will forever be held closely 
to my heart. To anybody reading 
this, whether it’s your first time 
in university or your final year, I 
hope you can take a golden nug-
get from it and I hope you’ve got 
or will get friends that will never 
demand your silence.

“No person is your friend who 

demands your silence, or denies 
your right to grow.”

— Alice Walker
I started college by saying 

bye to my dad, sending a picture 
to my mum, and walking into 
Angell Hall to register for class-
es. I knew not a single person at 
the University of Michigan and 
it was the first time I had been 
to the state was a week earlier. 
Not to mention, I signed up for 
the wrong semester (spring) 
and was handled like a trans-
fer student. So not only was I 
doing this college thing for the 
first time, I was surrounded by 
people who’d already done it 
before and many of whom did 
not look like me. Thus the jour-
ney of finding my chosen family 
began. Looking back I feel like 
I went through a bunch of dif-
ferent friend groups, many of 
which happened due to proxim-
ity. They all taught me a lot and 
I think it’s important to share 
those things, especially because 
of the toxic as well as formative 
friendships I have experienced 
in and outside of my own per-
sonal experience.

When I look back at my col-

lege experience, there are a lot 
of emotions that come up for 
me. Throughout all the emo-
tions — whether I find myself 
relaxing tightly clenched fists, 
laughing till I am teary eyed or 
holding back a deeply exagger-
ated eyeroll — at the end of this 
rollercoaster, I settle back, relax 
and smile when I think of who I 
shared these memories with.

Regardless of whether or not 

it was in the moment, we’ve 
been there for each other for 
heartbreaks, 
exams, 
gradua-

tions, birthdays, bad movies, 
shopping trips, photo shoots, 
awkward moments, late night 
Pizza House runs, all nighters 
all over campus, lapses in judg-
ment, concerts, rejection let-
ters, acceptance letters, deaths, 
births and so much more. This 

piece isn’t a sap story for all 
the sentimentalities of college. 
Rather a reflection on everyone 
from the Black/African women 
who I call my mothers/aunties/
sisters that I owe the world to 
the Residential College kids that 
taught me a thing or two about 
myself and every-
one in between that 
I loved and loved 
me in return. 

1. Get you some 

friends that want 
to see you thrive - I 
have seen too many 
people get spite-
ful because their 
friends were flour-
ishing 
and 
they 

weren’t. No matter 
how bad of a day I 
am having there is 
nothing that makes 
me happier than 
when my friends 
are slaying the game. Like my 
first and second year roommate 
Marjai used to say, “Girl, when 
you make it, we all make it.” 

2. Get you some friends that 

show you love - Love is such 
a loaded, multifaceted word. 
Love for me is friends spend-
ing numerous late nights to 
work me through yet another 
semester of French. Love is 
consistently letting me do the 
most on my birthday every year. 
Love is being your biggest sup-
porter and chanting your name 
even if it’s remotely. Love is 
knowing that your friends will 
always have your back because 
you’ve seen them go in on any-
one whether it was on Facebook 
or at Necto. Love is living in a 
house that was always ready to 
give you the tightest hug even 
after a fight. Love is knowing 
that I sleep with my phone on 
loud so you know you always 
have someone you can call.

3. Get you some friends that 

are brutally honest - If someone 
can’t tell you that your flan-
nel doesn’t match the 90s look 
you’re trying to pull off, they 
aren’t real. As hard as the truth 
is to hear, it has been so useful. It 
made me reevaluate the ways in 

which I utilized or didn’t utilize 
my privilege effectively. Calling 
each other out/in when we per-
petuated isms was vital. Sitting 
down and working through our 
flaws together, pushing our-
selves to grow, becoming more 
culturally aware of our back-

grounds in order to see the best 
in each other, that was friend-
ship.

4. Get you some friends that 

understand that you need to 
take care of yourself - #Self-
Care has come to mean so 
many different things. From a 
trendy new hashtag to a deeper 
understanding of Audre Lorde. 
I have learned to respect the 
healthy ways in which one cares 

Surround yourself with the ones that uplift you

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Michigan men’s basketball coach John Beilein will have to replace two assistant coaches after Billy Donlon’s departure.

Nielsen named next 
women’s lacrosse coach

A week after former Maryland 

assistant Kevin Conry was hired 
as the Michigan men’s lacrosse 
coach, the women’s 
program filled that 
same opening.

Athletic 

director 
Warde 

Manuel announced 
Monday 
that 

Hannah 
Nielsen, 

a member of the 
Australia women’s 
national team and 
assistant 
coach 

at 
Northwestern, 

will be the next coach of the 
Wolverines.

“I am thrilled to welcome 

one of the most accomplished 
women’s lacrosse players of 
all-time to lead our program,” 
Manuel said in a statement. 
“Hannah 
has 
proven 
her 

ability to translate her skills 
and knowledge of the game 
into a successful 
coaching career. 
She has been a 
winner at every 
level, and I am 
confident 
she 

is 
prepared 

to 
lead 
our 

women’s lacrosse 
program.”

Nielsen 
is 

one of the most 
accomplished 
players in the history of the 
sport. 
As 
a 
midfielder 
at 

Northwestern from 2006 to 
2009, she won four national 
championships, 
three 
All-

American 
honors 
and 
two 

Teewaraton Awards — which 
are given to the nation’s top 
college lacrosse player — in 
2008 and 2009. 

She is also the Wildcats’ all-

time leader in both points and 
assists, as well as the NCAA 
all-time leader in assists, single-
season assists and assists in a 
single game.

In international play, Nielsen 

is just as decorated. She was a 
part of Australia’s gold-medal 
winning 
team 
at 
the 
2005 

Women’s Lacrosse World Cup, 
and was named an All-Star at 
the 2009 and 2013 tournaments 

as 
Australia 

finished 
second 

and 
third, 

respectively. 
She is currently 
training with the 
national 
team 

as it prepares to 
compete in the 
2017 World Cup 
in England next 
month.

Nielsen’s 

coaching career began in 2009 
at Penn State, and she has also 
coached at Towson, Colorado 
and most recently Northwestern, 
where she helped guide the 
Wildcats into the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament last 
season.

“I 
am 
extremely 
excited 

and honored to be named the 

new head coach 
of the women’s 
lacrosse 
program 
at 

the 
University 

of 
Michigan,” 

Nielsen said in a 
statement. “I am 
excited to take 
the 
next 
step 

in my coaching 
career 
in 

becoming a head 

coach, and could not think of a 
better place to start this new 
chapter.

“I would like to thank Warde 

Manuel and Bitsy Ritt for this 
incredible 
opportunity 
and 

for their support so far. I am 
also grateful to Kelly Amonte 
Hiller, the Northwestern staff 
and athletic department for 
their ongoing support, and to 
my previous coaching mentors 
who have helped me get to this 
position. I am so excited to get 
started and for the future of 
this program.”

Donlon joins staff at Northwestern

In the span of just five days, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team is down to one assistant 
coach.

Scout.com’s 
Brian 
Snow 

reported Sunday afternoon that 
assistant coach Billy Donlon 
has accepted a similar position 
at 
Northwestern. 
Donlon, 

the 
former 
head 
coach 
at 

Wright State, was hired by the 
Wolverines just last May.

The Chicago Tribune reported 

Friday 
that 
Wildcats 
head 

coach Chris Collins was trying 
to lure Donlon away from the 
Wolverines, due to Donlon’s 
deep ties to the Northwestern 
program. Donlon is a native 
of nearby Northbrook, Ill. and 
longtime friend of Collins, and 
his father spent seven years as an 
assistant coach of the Wildcats.

And as it turns out, Collins 

was successful.

“We 
are 
obviously 

disappointed to be losing Billy, 
however, we are happy he has the 
opportunity to be closer to his 
family, home and still coach in 
the Big Ten,” said 
Michigan 
coach 

John Beilein in 
a press release. 
“He is one heck 
of a coach who 
has been a great 
asset 
to 
our 

program over this 
past year. Over 
many years, Billy 
has 
sacrificed 

his 
family 
for 

coaching basketball. This time 
he chose his family first and no 
one can fault him for that.

“We have had very talented 

coaching staff’s during my time 
here. That will not change. We 
have always embraced sudden 
change and have gotten better 
from it. I am excited to have this 
opportunity to bring in two new 

assistants who will bring us even 
more success in the future. The 
Team, The Team, The Team. Go 
Blue!”

Donlon’s 
departure 
comes 

after 
assistant 

coach Jeff Meyer 
announced 
Tuesday 
he 

was 
leaving 

Michigan to join 
the 
coaching 

staff 
at 
Butler. 

Unlike 
Donlon, 

Meyer had nine 
years 
with 
the 

Wolverines prior 
to his departure.

With Northwestern’s hiring of 

Donlon, Beilein will now have to 
fill two vacancies on his coaching

The Michigan volleyball team will play 15 games this season against teams that qualified for last year’s NCAA Tournament.

Michigan releases its 2017 volleyball schedule

Wednesday, 
the 
Michigan 

volleyball team released its full 
schedule for the 2017 season. 
The 
32-game 
slate 
includes 

15 
matches 
against 
teams 

that qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament last season, and 22 
games against teams that ranked 
in the Top 70 in RPI.

While the Wolverines opened 

last 
season 
in 

the 
friendly 

confines of Cliff 
Keen Arena for 
the 
Michigan 

Invitational, 
this year will be 
very 
different. 

Michigan 
will 

travel 
to 
Los 

Angeles 
for 

the 
USC/LMU 

Tournament 
August 
25-26 
for 
matches 

against 
Albany, 
USC 
and 

Loyola Marymount to begin its 
campaign. 

The 
season-opening 
trip 

to the West Coast is almost 
triple 
the 
distance 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ longest road trip 
last season, which took them 
to Manhattan, Kan. for the 
K-State Invitational.

Following the West Coast 

swing, 
Michigan 
will 
open 

its home slate against Butler 
on Sept. 1 in the Michigan 
Invitational. 
The 
Wolverines 

will continue the invitational 
with 
games 
against 
New 

Hampshire 
and 
Wisconsin-

Green 
Bay 
the 

next day.

Michigan’s 

third tournament 
of 
the 
season 

involves another 
challenging 
Western 
road 

trip. 
From 

Sept. 
8-10, 
the 

Wolverines 
will 

compete in the 
Colorado 
State 

Invitational against Idaho State, 
Colorado State and Ball State.

Just as it did last season, 

Michigan will host its final 
regular-season 
tournament 

— the Michigan Challenge — 
on the fourth weekend of the 
season. The Wolverines’ three 
opponents 
in 
the 
challenge 

are 
North 
Carolina 
State, 

Wisconsin-Milwaukee 
and 

Cincinnati.

Highlighting 
the 
non-

conference 
portion 
of 
the 

schedule are NCAA Tournament 
teams USC, New Hampshire and 
Colorado State.

Michigan will hope for similar 

success in non-conference action 
as it experienced last season, 
when the Wolverines went 11-1. 
These early triumphs will be 
necessary, as the Big Ten is 
possibly the most challenging 
conference in the country — last 
season, the conference ranked 
first in RPI and sent eight teams 
to 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament, 

including the top three overall 
seeds: Nebraska, Minnesota and 
Wisconsin.

The 20-game Big Ten slate 

doesn’t 
figure 
to 
get 
any 

easier in 2017. Michigan’s first 
two conference games are at 
Minnesota and at Wisconsin 
on Sept. 22 and 23. Ten of the 

Wolverines’ first 12 conference 
games are against teams who 
finished 
last 
season 
with 

winning records 
as well.

One 
notable 

feature 
of 

Michigan’s 
schedule 
is 

the 
lengthy 

home 
stretches 

relative 
to 
last 

season. In 2016, 
the 
Wolverines 

had 
only 
one 

stretch of three 
straight games at Cliff Keen 
Arena. 
However, 
Michigan 

will have two such stretches 
this year, including a four-
game string from Nov. 10-18 
against Northwestern, Illinois, 
Michigan State and Purdue.

Michigan’s 
first 
two 

conference home games will be 
against Ohio State and Maryland 
on Sept. 29-30. Aside from 
the four-game home stand in 
November, the Wolverines will 
also take on Minnesota, Iowa, 
Nebraska and Rutgers at Cliff 
Keen Arena.

After the conference openers 

on the road, Michigan will 
travel next to Iowa on Oct. 4. 

the 
Wolverines 

will also go on 
the 
road 
from 

Oct. 13-21 for four 
straight 
games 

against 
Rutgers, 

Penn 
State, 

Michigan 
State 

and Ohio State, a 
streak the length 
of which was not 
seen last season. 
Michigan’s three 

road games in November are 
against Illinois, Indiana and 
Purdue, the latter two finishing 
the Wolverines’ regular-season 
schedule.

Last 
season, 
Michigan 

survived Big Ten play with 
an 11-9 conference record. If 
the Wolverines do the same 
this season and finish at least 
.500, they should be in good 
shape to qualify for the NCAA 
Tournament 
for 
the 
third 

straight season, and the 16th 
time in 19 seasons under head 
coach Mark Rosen.

D.J. Wilson became the sixth Wolverine to be drafted in the first round since 2014 when the Milwaukee Bucks took him 17th overall.

Conry named head coach

Six weeks ago, Michigan athletic 

director Warde Manuel announced 
the firing of men’s lacrosse coach 
John Paul, the only head coach the 
program has known.

Wednesday, Manuel found his 

replacement when he announced 
the official hiring of Kevin Conry, 
formerly the associate head coach and 
defensive coordinator at Maryland.

Conry spent five years in College 

Park — a span during which the 
Terrapins went 67-17, including a 
third straight Big Ten title and a 
national championship this season. 
Under Conry’s guidance, Maryland’s 
defense ranked in the Top 10 in 
fewest goals allowed in four out of 
five seasons.

Instead of trying to defend a 

national title at a perennial power 
next season, however, Conry’s next 
task will be to continue building a 
program from the ground up.

Maryland and Michigan may 

share conference affiliation, but aside 
from that, the two programs could 
hardly be more different. Maryland’s 

lacrosse 
program 
has 
existed 

since 1924, and is one of the most 
prestigious in NCAA history — the 
Terrapins are the only major college 
team that has never had a losing 
season, and have won 31 conference 
titles and three national titles while 
making 40 NCAA Tournament 
appearances.

The Wolverines, on the other 

hand, only added varsity lacrosse in 
2012, and have had just one winning 
season in their history. That one 
winning season, however, took place 
just this year, when Michigan went 
8-6 and defeated a ranked opponent 
— No. 10 Penn — for the first time 
ever.

“My wife, daughters and I could 

not be more excited to join the 
Michigan Athletics family, and Ann 
Arbor community,” Conry said in 
a statement. “The University of 
Michigan represents a standard of 
excellence that I look forward to 
upholding. I would like to thank sport 
administrator Bitsy Ritt and athletic 
director Warde Manuel for their 
commitment to the sport of lacrosse, 
and this amazing opportunity to 
be a head coach in the best lacrosse 
conference in the country.”

Wilson drafted in first round by Bucks, 
Irvin, Walton to play in summer league

The 2017 NBA Draft took place 

Thursday night at the Barclays 
Center in Brooklyn, N.Y.. Three 
former Michigan players — Derrick 
Walton Jr., D.J. Wilson and Zak Irvin 
— anticipated possible selections, 
waiting to learn their next basketball 
destination.

Wilson, however, was the only 

one to find out Thursday, as the 
Milwaukee Bucks drafted the 6-foot-
10 forward with the 17th pick in the 
first round.

Walton and Irvin were not 

among the 60 players selected in the 
draft, but both players reportedly 
accepted invitations to play in the 
NBA Summer League — Walton with 
the Orlando Magic as reported by 
MLive’s Brendan Quinn and Irvin 
with the Miami Heat according to 
ESPN’s Chris Haynes. If Walton and 
Irvin impress in Summer League 
competition, they can earn an 
invitation to an NBA training camp 
in hopes of eventually signing a 
professional contract.

Most 
sources 
had 
projected 

Wilson as a late first-round pick, 
while Walton and Irvin were both 
predicted to either go late in the 
second round or undrafted.

Wilson 
becomes 
the 
sixth 

Wolverine in the last five years to 
be drafted in the first round, joining 
Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway 
in 2013, Nik Stauskas and Mitch 
McGary in 2014 and Caris LeVert a 
year ago.

This scenario didn’t seem likely at 

the onset of the Sacramento, Calif. 
native’s college career. With injuries 
and inconsistency playing a role, 
Wilson averaged just 5.9 minutes 
and 2.3 points per game his first two 
seasons.

However, Wilson was finally able 

to show off his unique skill set this 
season, and shot onto NBA teams’ 
draft radars. He used his 7-foot-3 
wingspan to average 5.3 rebounds 
and 1.5 blocks per game, and also 
displayed a smooth shooting stroke 
for a player his size, knocking down 
37 percent of his three-point attempts 
and scoring 11 points per contest.

The Bucks, a young, lengthy 

and athletic team built around 
6-foot-11 
star 
forward 
Giannis 

Antetokounmpo, were attracted to 
Wilson for his physical tools and 
versatility.

“Watching him on film, he fits 

the DNA of the Bucks, being able 
to play multiple positions,” said 
Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd in a 
press conference after the draft.

Walton, a four-year starter at point 

guard for Michigan, averaged 15.5 
points, 4.8 rebounds and 5.0 assists 
per game as a senior while shooting 
42 percent from distance. The Detroit 
native also ranks fourth in Wolverine 
history in assists and three-pointers 
made. Despite Walton’s decorated 
college career and his ability to score, 
rebound and run an offense, he was 
only projected to be drafted late in 
the second round if at all, due in large 
part to his short stature at just six feet 
tall.

Irvin appeared in 142 games in his 

Michigan career, tied for the most all-
time, and also ranks third in program 
history for three-pointers. In his final 
season as a Wolverine, he averaged 
13 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. 
His outside shooting and perimeter 
defense are his main strengths that 
he will hope to take to the next level.
