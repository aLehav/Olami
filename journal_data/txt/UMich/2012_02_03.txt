UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
- 'U' could
see drop
in federal
funding
VP for research still
optimistic with gov't
cuts looming
By MARISA WINTER
Daily StaffReporter
At the University's Board of
Regents meeting last month, Ste-
phen Forrest, the University's vice
president for research, introduced
the University's annual research
report with the pretense that the
future of research funding from the
federal government appears bleak.
The report revealed that while
federal funding has increased mar-
ginally this year in comparison to
last, future funding is uncertain
amid fluctuating trends in financial
support from industry and federal-
level partnerships. Possible funding
cuts from the government and the
National Institutes of Health could
cause major changes in the Univer-
sity's research funding plan, accord-
ing to University officials.
In an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily last month, University
President Mary Sue Coleman said if
federal financial support decreases,
funding research at the University
could be problematic.
"If that happens, we're going to
have to look at everything; there's

SA*asfor collaboration

Group hopes to
increase mid-day
routes on weekend
By LIANA'ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
With help from the Oxford
Bus Petition, students traveling
back and forth between Oxford
Housing and Central Campus
on weekends may no longer
need to walk down South Uni-
versity Avenue from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m.
Creators of the petition -
developed last October by the
Oxford Community Council -
continue to garner support for
an appeal for the Oxford Shuttle
to run on the same schedule on
the weekend as it does during
the week. Thus far, more than
900 people have signed the peti-
tion.
The shuttle runs from Oxford
Housing to the C.C. Little
bus stop, with stops at Shap-
iro Undergraduate Library,
the Michigan Union and Hill
Auditorium. Currently, stu-
dents seeking transportation
to Oxford Housing from Cen-
tral Campus during midday on

weekends are forced to walk or
seek alternative forms of trans-
portation, since service doesn't
begin until 5 p.m.
Oxford Housing is home to
more than 350 undergraduate
students according to Univer-
sity housing. The Sigma Alpha
Mu and Phi Gamma Delta fra-
ternities, and the Delta Gamma
and Alpha Phi sororities, are
also located in the Oxford area,
which has had a history ofcrime
in recent years.
LSA senior Parisa Behzadi,
a diversity peer educator for
Oxford Housing who oversees
Oxford Community Council,
said the petition follows a previ-
ous, separate request to extend
Oxford bus hours from 5p.m. to
10 p.m. on weekends, which was
implemented last winter. Before
then, there were no Oxford
buses running on Saturdays or
Sundays.
Behzadi said many people
signed the petition after it was
introduced, but at the end of
last semester, the pace began to
slow. She said she then sent the
petition to other diversity peer
editors and asked them to for-
ward it to other Housing staff
members to rekindle interest.

DETERMINED DRIVE CAMPUS TRANSPORTATION
Student group works to
create bike share program

CSG, PTS also
involved in
planning process
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
Campus transportation may
soon become more accessible
and environmentally friendly
with the introduction of a new
bike-sharing program awaiting

approval from the University.
TruMich, a student organiza-
tion focused on alternative and
mass transit on campus, is work-
ing to promote and coordinate
with the University bike-sharing
program. The initiative would
allow students to take a bike
from a kiosk with the swipe of
an MCard and deposit it at any of
several other kiosks on campus.
While the bike share program
is still in its beginning stages,
LSA junior Joseph Elliott, presi-

dent of TruMich, said its increas-
ing potential is limitless and and
the group has high levels of stu-
dent support.
"Bike-sharing could be the
most accessible form of transit
here," Elliott said. "Even though
Main Street is not that far away,
it is still a hassle. The sharing
system will enable students to
explore the city and campus
more."

to get approval for the bike-
sharing program in the fall, and
it has now reached about 1,250
signatures. In addition, both
Central Student Government and
LSA Student Government's Tak-
ing Responsibility for the Earth
and Environment subcommittee
have recently endorsed the pro-
gram.
"We increased our campaign
efforts and we have expanded
like crazy," Elliott said. "In the
past two days alone, we got over
400 signatures. We were just
getting our feet wet in the fall but
now we have a lot of student sup-
port."
Elliott said the process of set-
ting up the program is difficult
and requires continued support
and collaboration from students,
University administrators and
city officials.
"We have talked to adminis-
trators and they have been help-
ful and insightful but they are
not sure if the University has the
money or the critical mass at the
moment," Elliott said.
Stephen Dolen, executive
director of the University's Park-
ing and Transportation Services,
said the University has been
working with the city to make
infrastructure more bike-friend-
ly.
"A lot of the roads bikers use
are major city roads so we are
working together with the city
on that," Dolen said. "We are col-
laborating with city on the non-
motorized plan."
While developing the pro-

gram, Elliott and Dolen have
extensively researched other
communities with successful
bike share programs.
Dolen said he is following
plans similarto those established
in Denver and Boulder, Colo. and
colleges such as the University of
California Davis and Washington
State University.
Elliott said he worries that
the University may try to use
a bike rental system in place of
bike sharing, a mistake made by
Washington, D.C.'s SmartBike
system.
"A bike share will be more
readily used," Elliott said. "If you
rent a bike you need to return it
to the (Sports and Recreation
Center) and on top of that you
need to pay a small fee. For a bike
share program there are multi-
ple places to return the bike and
it would increase mobilization
throughout campus."
LSA senior Matt Lonnerstater
wrote in an e-mail interview that
he thinks students would ben-
efit from a bike share program,
but that pressing infrastructure
issues should be resolved before
the program is instated.
"If a bike-sharing program
were to be introduced in Ann
Arbor today given its current
bike infrastructure, the program
would go down in flames," Lon-
nerstater wrote. "Much like an
incomplete game of connect the
dots, Ann Arbor bike rental sta-
tions would serve no feasible
purpose without an organized
system of bike lanes and paths to
get from one station to another."
Lonnerstater wrote that the
establishment of a better trans-
portation system for bikers

is critical before a bike shar-
ing system can successfully be
implemented. This concern was
echoed by other students at a
forum last week hosted by the
Office of Campus Sustainability
and PTS. Students said biking,
especially to North Campus, was
unsafe.
School of Information gradu-
ate student Shiblee Hasan said he
would use the bikes to get to class
and around campus.
"I would use it a lot," Hasan
said. "I have to jump around a lot
of buildings and I think it would
help me get places faster."
LSA freshman Damie Pak
agreed with Hasan and said she
is looking forward to the sharing
system, as she commutes home
by bike.
"I have a bike but I leave it
home for the winter," Pak said.
"But if there was a bike sharing
program I would definitely use
it. It's healthy and I like doing
it. And with the shared bikes
it would be more convenient
because I can leave it anywhere."
At the bike forum last Monday,
students voiced concerns regard-
ing a lack of enclosed spaces and
parking availability.
However, Elliott said bike-
sharing works due to its simplic-
ity, adding that finding parking
and worrying about maintain-
ing the bike is not the student's
responsibility.
"A lot of students have bikes,
but are not able to bring them
from home, or choose not to
because there are not enough
bike racks or they are afraid their
bikes will get stolen," Elliott said.
"So this just allows them to have
an easy source."

LSA-SG president Anne
Laverty said she hoped the event
helped to improve the relation-
ship between students and LSA
administration.
"(We want) to bridge that
disconnect between students
and administrators," she said.
"(People) want to connect."
LSA senior Eman Abdelhadi,
president of the Muslim Stu-
dent Association, said the dia-
logue was especially relevant to
the Arab and Muslim students
studying liberal arts. She said
many Arab and Muslim students
feel they can only study engi-
neering ortake pre-med courses.
"Without these types of dia-
logues, you have whole pockets
of communities on campus who
just don't know about the initia-
tives that the administration is
putting on for them," she said. "I
think that's problematic for both
ends."
OXFORD
From Page 1
The petition now has more
than 900 signatures. Behzadi
said the council is waiting to gain
at least 1,000 signatures before
presenting its requests to Univer-
sity administrators.
Steve Dolen, executive direc-
tor of University Parking and
Transportation Services, said
the department takes a variety of
factors into consideration when
making decisions to alter bus
scheduling. He said the addition
of Oxford bus hours on the week-
end was not a direct response to
the petition, but rather the result
of an evaluation of the situation
and collaboration among groups
on campus.
"An evaluation process is
always a collaboration between
Student Affairs, Housing and
other groups on campus," Dolen
said. "We don't make decisions
in avacuum."
Dolan said the weekend hours
of 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. were chosen
to give students a transporta-
tion option before SafeRide - a
free service offered to students
in need of transportation late at

Abdelhadi added that Univer-
sity administrators need to do
a better job of advertising the
value of LSA degrees.
"When a student graduates
from a top five department and
yet feels like their degree will
not take them anywhere in life,
then that's a huge failure," she
said. "(Administrators) com-
municate to students the value
of that degree and to instill in
them that confidence to know
that that's a degree that's sought
after in the world."
Philip Deloria, LSA associ-
ate dean of undergraduate edu-
cation, and Marjorie Horton,
assistant dean for undergradu-
ate education in LSA, also spoke
to the meeting's attendees.
Deloria stressed the importance
of improving the relationship
between administrators and
students.
Deloria specifically men-
tioned the Sophomore Initia-
tive - a program tailored to
LSA sophomores that includes
courses and a special CTools site
night - begins service.
Dolen declined to comment
on how PTS will react to the
petition since it has not yet been
presented. However, he said the
opinions of students and other
organizations are important to
PTS and would certainly be con-
sidered, adding that administra-
tors will also take into account
the financial aspect of expand-
ing hours as they continue to
reach out to members of the
community.
"We would take (the petition)
'into consideration, with every-
thing else, when we're talking
to these other groups, our con-
stituents and our customers,"
Dolen said. "We're making sure
we're touching base with all the
right folks and of course it comes
down to making sure we're
using our resources wisely, so
it's a financial decision as well."
Dolen added that ensuring
student safety is a "key part" of
PTS' role on campus.
"It's about supporting the
academic mission, it's about sup-
porting the housing mission for
students," Dolen said. "Security
is definitely a key piece of any
decision we make."
LSA sophomore Kristen Cleg-

and how LSA used e-mail list-
servs to inform students about
exclusive courses, though few
were aware of these efforts.
Deloria added that he is look-
ing for new ways to reach out
to students, including improv-
ing the presence of LSA deans
online.
"All the websites in the dean's
office are a total mess," he said.
Deloria said he would also
consider obtaining a list of LSA
students' phone numbers. He
said the list could be used to
send out short, important text
messages to students that would
lead them to a simple, easy-to-
use website, adding that access
and use of the list would need to
be extremely limited to prevent
abuse.
After the event, both McDon-
ald and Laverty agreed that it
was a productive discussion.
"People are interested in this
and want more conversation," .
Laverty said. "Hopefully this
will be something student gov-
ernment will do more of."
horn, president of the Oxford
Community Council, said she
is motivated by the previous
changes to the Oxford Shuttle
hours and is looking forward to
future changes.
"Now that we've won that
battle, we're trying to expand
busing hours because the need
is still high, especially in the
Oxford area," she said.
Cleghorn said the need for
extended bus hours is crucial,
especially because of the numer-
ous assaults and robberies that
have occurred in the Oxford
area in the past.
"We think it's really impor-
tant to have hours that extend,
just for everyone's safety," she
said.
Cleghorn said she sent the
petition to a number of Greek
Life leaders in order to gain
additional support, adding that
she is pleased that the major-
ity of them have forwarded the
petition to their members, which
has made a significant impact.
"I'm honestly really glad to
see it picking up pace," she said.
"I'm really happy that the coun-
cil has the opportunity to make
such a lasting improvement to
Michigan safety."

Slaying of girl,12,
was over cell phone
A shooting that left a 12-year-
old Detroit honor roll student
dead stemmed from a misunder-
standing about a mobile phone
that escalated into gunfire at the
girl's home, her mother said.
AmandaTaltontoldtheDetroit
Free Press that a man came to her
northwest side home Tuesday
night believing she had a phone
that belonged to another woman.
She denied she had it and closed
the door. That's when shots were
fired through the door, striking
her daughter, Kade'jah Davis,
multiple times.
"We were running and getting
down," Talton said.
A 19-year-old man suspected
in the shooting was arrested
early Wednesday, while his
35-year-old mother, who police
believed drove him to the home,
was arrested late Tuesday, police
said.

Groundhog wars:

Pennsylvania's Punxsutawney
Phil told people to prepare for six
more weeks of winter yesterday,
making him the minority opinion

who seem to think that spring is

But with such a mild and rela-

Phil's "prediction" came as he
emerged from his lair to "see" his
shadow on Gobbler's Knob, a tiny
hill in the town for which he's
named about 65 miles northeast
of Pittsburgh.
Yet groundhogs in at least five
other states - West Virginia's

Police shot and killed two

riot at a soccer stadium killed
74, as sports violence spiraled
into a new political crisis for
Egypt.
Protesters blame police for
failing to control the riot after

Cairo, thousands demonstrated
yesterday in front of the Interior
Ministry, which oversees the

renewable energy sources and
farming. This is Wright's third
year leading the program. He
took bringing students to Pata-
gonia in southern South Ameri-
ca to study hydropower in 2008
and 2009.
Despite the lack of engineer-
ing students in his class, Wright
said he understands why stu-
dents from across the University
are inclined to enroll given its
interactive approach and inter-
national component.
"You can talk about things in
a lecture setting, and that's a sat-
isfactory way to learn," he said.
"But if you can learn something
about a very particular issue
and then go talk to people who
might be directly involved in it
on a day-to-day basis, it becomes
a much more powerful learning
experience."
Apart from being a popu-
lar option for students to study
abroad, the course empha-
sizes the University's atten-
tion to sustainability research,
which, according to Univer-
sity researchers and research
administrators, is growing in
scale and scope.
At the Graham Environmen-
tal Sustainability Institute, inte-
grated assessments - studies
that devise solutions to directed
environmental problems with
the aid of policymakers - have
expanded the scope of issues the
University can address, accord-
ing to Don Scavia, the Institute's
director.
Scavia said he is optimistic
about the research the Universi-
ty's faculty is currently conduct-
ing on sustainability.
"We've hit the sweet spot in
where we ought to be going and
what we ought to be doing," Sca-
via said.
Scavia, who also serves as
University President Mary Sue
Coleman's special counsel on
sustainability, said one such
assessment culminated in the
$14 million sustainability plan
Coleman announced last Sep-
tember.
Larissa Larsen, associate
professor of urban planning
and of landscape, is conducting
research for two additional Inte-
grated Assessments, including a
study on how midsize cities in
the Great Lakes region can adapt
to climate change in the coming
years.
Larsen - in collaboration

with colleagues and students
from the School of Natural
Resources and Environment, the
Gerald R. Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy, the School of Public
Health and the College of Engi-
neering - is surveying policy-
makers in Ann Arbor, Grand
Rapids, Marquette, Mich. and
Milwaukee, Wisc., about their
concerns with environmental
issues.
The team has also been can-
vassing random residents in the
cities to seek their opinions on
prominent environmental top-
ics highlighted by legislators,
including precipitation and tem-
perature. Larsen said the team
will then conduct research about
the issues in those cities and
analyze the input from lawmak-
ers and citizens to make policy
recommendations.
Larsen is also studying the
links between transportation
and sustainably grown food
in parts of Ypsilanti. Since the
areas of Ypsilanti and Ypsi-
lanti Township are among the
poorest in Washtenaw County,
Larsen said she and Joe Grengs,
associate professor of urban and
regional planning, are looking at
the feasibility of bringing local
vendors of sustainably grown
food to bus stops and stations.
"Working in this multi-dis-
ciplinary way is really impor-
tant for these kinds of pressing
concerns and questions for how
these communities make good
choices," Larsen said. "There
are so many issues to tackle but
working with a group of diverse
people improves the kind of
answers and resolutions you can
propose."
The interdisciplinary
approach to sustainability
research at the University also
improves researchers' chances
of earning federal grants for
their projects and, in doing so,
expands the range of studies
here, Scavia said. The Univer-
sity has been able to respond to
federal requests for interdisci-
plinary research by assembling
teams from across fields and
schools.
Accordingto Scavia, research-
ers at the Graham Institute have
received about $390 million in
federal grants over the last 10
years. The Campus Sustain-
ability Integrated Assessment
identified climate, water and liv-
able systems as the three most
important areas, and funding
for these areas has increased 40
percent over the last four years.
The benefits of the Universi-

ty's success in acquiring federal
funding have been felt Univer-
sity-wide as researchers unite
to study multifaceted environ-
mental issues. Michael Moore,
dean for research at the School
of Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment, said there have been
increased efforts to acquire fed-
eral grants for large-scale sus-
tainability projects developed in
recent years.
"We have insights that single
insights won't generate," Moore
said. "That's critical. By having a
kind of multi-disciplinary team,
we're able to pose questions that
a single discipline can't."
Moore said sustainability
research at the school centers on
climate change studies since it
has been hard to encourage non-
scientists to care about sustain-
ability.
"It's a huge social problem to
get people to engage and think
about global warming," he said.
"It still feels like it's in the dis-
tant future - it's 20 years off,
it's 40 years off, we'll deal with
it later."
Moore added that sustain-
ability as a whole is a pressing
issue socially, environmentally,
politically and economically.
To address these facets, the
school enlists a variety of fac-
ulty, including ecologists,
geographers, sociologists, psy-
chologists and economists, he
said.
"Some of our research is
political scientists thinking in
political science terms," he said.
"But we also have teams where
ecologists will be working with
hydrologists and working with
economists, geographers and
other social scientists."
Moore pointed to consumer
behavior as a growing field of
sustainability research. Psy-
chologists and sociologists are
partnering with climate change
experts and economists to deter-
mine how to convince citizens to
be aware of their carbon foot-
print and encourage them to
invest in products that reduce it.
"It's a good time to be doing
environment research," he said.
"Funding is relatively good -
there's more opportunities, and
there's more interest from our
faculty."
Scavia agreed and said he was
pleased the University commits
itself to researching sustainabil-
ity issues.
"It's like turning an ocean
liner," he said. "It doesn't happen
quickly, but when it happens, it's
sustained."

FUNDING
From Page 1
no easy answer," Coleman said.
"It's going to be a big challenge
to us, because we already sub-
sidize research to the tune of
about 25 percent of the $1.2 bil-
lion (research budget)."
Despite the possible federal
funding setbacks, Forrest said
he believes in the strength of
the University's research pro-
grams and its continued push
toward innovation. He added
that research initiatives are still
a high priority to the federal
government, and the University
expects to remain competitive
with other leading research uni-
versities moving forward.
"We are hoping that we can
be more competitive so we can
keep building research enter-
prise in the face of cuts," Forrest
said. "The bottom line is that
during these tough economic
times, we are at least encour-
aged by the fact that innova-
tion, research and new ideas
have strong bipartisan support
by both Congress and the presi-
dent."
Forrest added that industry
funding is becoming increas-
ingly important because it
strengthens federal ties.
"We are working hard to
diversify our funding sources, as
corporate funding is important
for many reasons," Forrest said.
"They make us familiar with
problems that are important
in the real world, as essential
(industry) team members are on
many federal proposals."
Coleman said the University
will use its history of success to
look to various other sources to
increase research funding.
"I think we have a lot of
options to look at, that is,
increased philanthropy for
research, which we've had
some big success with, more
interaction with industry -
we've had success with that,"
Coleman said. "We've had suc-
cess in helping our professors
make sure that their proposals
are competitive by doing pre-
reviews and all sorts of things to
help them get a bigger share of
the research budget."
Despite the financial diffi-

culties that may lay ahead for
University research programs,
Forrest said he is hopeful for the
future.
"My outlook for the future
is always optimistic, that is my
nature," Forrest said. "Some
doors close, others will open.
This is a time of enormous
opportunity as things are in
flux. We can do very well and
that is exciting."
Engineering Prof. Paul Car-
son, whose research would be
affected by a funding decrease,
echoed Coleman, and said the
University will continue to com-
pete for research funds from
both governmental and industry
sources.
"Michigan has been concen-
trating on being a major research
universitysince I began 30 years
ago," Carson said. "Our radiol-
ogy department has been the
fourth highest in grant dollars
in the country and it has been
that way for the last five years."
Carson added that he doesn't
think the lack of growth in fed-
eral funding will hinder the
advancement of individual Uni-
versity departments.
"Although national funding
has not grown as much, (the)
biomedical department has
more growth potential (and)
EECS has been a leader in fund-
ing but has slipped in the num-
ber of students," Carson said.
"Regardless, they will continue
to be strong departments."
He added that despite the
federal funding cuts, the Uni-
versity will continue to support
research initiatives, particularly
with potential pending corpo-
rate aid and the newly opened
North Campus Research Com-
plex.
"Federal funding is likely to
decline in the short-term as we
address federal budget issues
and decline more seriously as
we come out of the recession,"
Carson said. "We will not be
growing in research dollars as
we have in the last decade, but
the fact that we have the North
Campus Research Complex with
lots of growth potential, we can
grow despite the decreasingfed-
eral funding."

Encouraging investment
Businesses should follow Quicken into Detroit
nnovation outside the automotive sector may have finally found
its way back to Detroit. After decades of constant and well-pub-
licized troubles, the city has begun to cultivate entrepreneurial
spirit once again. On Monday, Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert
announced plans to recruit "the best and the brightest businesses" to
the Motor City. The company will aim to accomplish this in part by
purchasing its ninth building in the city. Quicken Loans' investment
in a city that is usually an afterthought of commercial interests is
commendable, and the potential businesses it's helping will add value
to the city. Other companies should follow suit, and the city of Detroit
and state of Michigan should do all they can to encourage this invest-
ment and entrepreneurship.

Love atfirst site

With February upon us,
stores everywhere
have stocked up on
heart-shaped
chocolate boxes,
mushy greet-
ing cards and
red everything.
Campus is no
exception, as 1
students either
anxiously await LEAH
or dread the POTKIN
arrival of Val- _
entine's Day, the
Hallmark holi-
day.
While the comfort of old relation-
ships encourages some students to
take advantage of sharing romantic
evenings with their significant other,
many other students celebrate the
day by going outon thectown with the
excitement of searching for and kin-
dling new relationships. Still, other
students turn to a more novel way of
meeting new people and finding love
- the Internet.
The world of online dating is
nothing new, but its recent appear-
ance on college campuses with web-
sites like Datemyschool.com, a site
founded by two MBA students at
Columbia University, have left col-
lege students' hearts pounding in an
untraditional way. While in the past
college students have taken advan-
tage of their surroundings to meet
potential love interests - at bars, in
class or through other school-related
activities - dating websites geared
specifically toward college students
have added a whole new level to the
playing field, for better or for worse.
At first blush, the idea of a group-
specific dating website targeting col-
lege students makes perfect sense in
the same way religious dating sites
such as JDate.com and Christian-
Mingle.com do. Upon further con-
sideration, however, turning to the
Internet to find love at such a young

age poses more cons than pros.
While I accept that people
searching for partners in isolated
or familiar communities may need
dating websites to broaden the pool
of potential mates, University stu-
dents have the unique advantage of
thousands of other students at their
dating disposal. At the University
there are myriad opportunities to
meet like-minded people face to
face. Given this environment, I can't
help but question the need for dat-
ing websites on college campuses.
Generally speaking, as a genera-
tion we have already discarded the
now old-fashioned forms of courtship
such as phone calls and face-to-face
interaction in favor of text messaging
and Facebook. According to many
of our elders, these new practices
impede our ability to sustain person-
al relationships. So, before we give
technology even greater control over
the course of our relationships and
hamper our already compromised
ability to interact with others in per-
son, I firmly believe students should
shun these new dating websites and
continue to give the old-fashioned
way of meeting people a fair shot, at
least while they're still in college.
Furthermore, I truly question
whether students' interests are actu-
ally served by embracing online
dating at a young age. Unlike older
users on Internet dating sites who
are often looking for more serious,
lasting relationships but tend not to
have time or opportunity to meet
potential soul mates, college students
often are more interested in "playing
the field." While dating website users
looking for long term commitment
could comprise a rare sector of young
20-somethings, it seems more plau-
sible that users would only be looking
for an easy fling.
Assuming the latter is true, and
students feel no immediate rush to
settle down, it seems that meet-and-
greets could be done equally and

many times more effectively out and
around campus. And it almost goes
without saying that meeting people
in person also eliminates the surpris-
es, disappointments, not to mention
risks associated with online set ups.
This isn't to say I'm anti-online
dating as a whole. In fact, I'm actu-
ally quite for it. Dating websites
undoubtedly have their benefits
as mediums by which people with
busy schedules and limited time
can branch out and meet people
they wouldn't otherwise. However,
keeping in mind that college pres-
ents a unique opportunity in a per-
son's life to meet all different types
of people, I don't think students
necessarily need the help of a vir-
tual Cupid's arrow so early on.
Students should
shun new college
online dating.
So, if I find myself boyfriend-less
a couple of years down the road
and living with cats, I'd turn to the
Internet in a heartbeat. As college
students at such a large and diverse
University, however, where new
dating prospects constantly sur-
round us, we shouldn't be too quick
to rely on computers to make all the
effort.
Ultimately, in light of the Feb-
ruary rush to find love before the
approaching "holiday," students
should put down their computers to
find that special someone, and they
should save online dating for later
down the road.

Gilbert doesn't just plan to expand Quick-
en's internal operations within the city. He
announced that the company would hire 300
software engineers along with 500 summer
interns. The Intern Alley program is focused
on exposing college students to business-relat-
ed entrepreneurship. Creating jobs, particu-
larly in technology related fields, is preparation
for an economy of the future. Quicken Loans
climbed Fortune's "Best Companies to Work
For" ranking once again this year - jumping
to loth place from 29th last year. Forbes cited
Quicken's move from the suburbs into Detroit
as part of the improved ranking.
With all of the drama concerning Detroit's
budget playing out in the background, news
that private companies are moving back to
Detroit is exciting. Small business and entre-
preneurship in emerging technology sectors
have grown exponentially in the past few
years. Technology startups, including Twitter
and Facebook, have demonstrated the poten-
tial economic power of investments similar
to the one Quicken is making. Investment
in Detroit, especially in its youth, projects a
bright economic future. Progressive move-
ment forward is precisely what the city needs
to move beoynd its troubled past.
Detroit has been trying to attract start-ups

and innovative companies for years - the
Tech Town business park in Midtown comes
to mind. These efforts are commendable, but
must be continued to attract young entre-
preneurs. There are large numbers of recent
college graduates in Michigan, and students
should take advantage of the low cost of living
in Detroit, coupled with incentives and invest-
ments like the ones Quicken is offering.
Companies are starting to invest, but part
of the responsibility must be put on the city
of Detroit to build a solid foundation. Detroit
must offer basic residential services, includ-
ing those currently threatened by budget
cuts. Electricity and garbage pick-up are
necessary to create an attractive business
climate. If people are to invest in the city, the
city must invest in the people and in itself.
If Detroit is to rely on the innovations of its
residents, the residents must be able to rely
on Detroit's infrastructure.
It seems like Detroit's recovery is on its way.
Investment in emerging markets, innovation
and imagination are valuable pursuits. Yet
none of them can happen without the rein-
forcement of the Detroit city government. To
encourage Detroit's success, the state, city,
businesses and residents must cooperate with
a powerful vision of the future in mind.

Fou yers later...

"Yes we can! Yes we can!" Four years later,
I heard these words being sung outby a select
few students in front of the Michigan Union
as they waited in line for tickets to see Presi-
dent Barack Obama speak on campus last
friday. As the small group of students - 5 or
so - continued their attempt at getting the
political chant going, they looked around and
quickly realized that it simply wasn't work-
ing. The previously over-used catchphrase
wasn't igniting their peers like it once did.
Instead, the couple hundred students
standing in that particular segment of the
line had uneasy looks on their faces as they
listened to the chant. They seemed afraid of
yelling those three infamous words. Even
I, someone who used to sing this battle cry
to anyone who would listen, felt like it just
wasn't the same. The students who were yell-
ing eventually realized that they weren't in
2008 anymore and fell quiet.
Last week, University students were con-
fronted with a once in a lifetime opportunity
- to see the president speak in person. Thou-
sands of us waited outside in bone-chilling
temperatures all night outside of the Union
just to get a ticket. Even those who didn't
wait in line were anxious to see Obama. Some
reported scalping their ticket for as much as
$150. Needless to say, once we were able to
actually see Obama speak, the electricity in
Al Glick Field House was undeniable.
Standing 20 feet away from the leader of
the free world, I felt that same rush that I had
in 2008. I felt like I was part of something
bigger than myself and perhaps real change
was on the horizon.
Thinking my friends felt the same way, I
asked them if they were goingto get involved
in the 2012 campaign. One of my friends, a
fellow applicant to the Ford School of Public
Policy and someone who I consider one of
my more politically-aware peers, sheepishly
replied, "I don't think I am going to be able
to vote for Obama. He has just done too many
things that I just can't agree with."
"Really," I said in disbelief, "You're such
a liberal-minded person. Why are you even
waiting in line right now?" She explained to
me that Obama hadn't lived up to his word
from 2008 and that she was waiting only

because of the honor of being able to see the
President speak.
Shocked by my friend's response, I asked
others their feelings about this topic. Almost all
of them agreed that along with not volunteer-
ing in the 2012 campaign, they were just there
for the experience of seeing the president and
weren't even planningon voting for him.
How did this happen? How did so many
of the very people that helped catapult an
unlikely candidate, the African-American
senator from Illinois, into the presidency
suddenly not care about the election? In
2008, Obama promised change and a future
different from the status quo - a difficult
promise to live up to. Unfortunately, people
aren't satisfied with how it has been fulfilled.
"So what now?" I asked my peers. "Are you
just goingto vote for whoever the Republican
nominee is?"
"Oh, God no!" most of them responded.
Almost all of my friends who once supported
Obama aren't switching sides - they simply
aren't voting at all. A generation at the fore-
front of political involvement in 2008, will
once again go unheard in 2012.
But, there is hope for Democrats - espe-
cially those who fear Obama may lose his re-
election bid. Though America's youth isn't
supporting Obama right now, at least they're
not supporting the alternative. The night
that thousands of students waited outside to
hear Obama speak, the Republican presiden-
tial candidates had another debate. As usual,
nothing came of it. Mitt Romney and Newt
Gingrich just tore each other apart, trying to
convince countless Americans that neither
was fit to be commander in chief.
America's youth may not be willing to rally
behind Obama just yet. But, as the Republi-
can presidential candidates continue their
circus and avoid working towards actual
solutions, America's youth will slowly realize
that Obama is better than the alternative.
It may be a little premature to start the
"Yes we can" chants, but with a little more
encouragement, the faint murmur heard out-
side of the Union may once again turn into a
mighty political voice.

But is the
number of years
we spend in school a good measure
of how much we've learned? Do we
need 17 years in class and a pile of
debt just to find work that pays the
bills? And are the modest reforms
advocated by Obama last Friday a
real solution to the problem?.
I don't think so. There's a deeper
problem here: The runaway over-
development of American educa-
tion in response to an exaggerated
labor market focus on educational
credentials, a phenomenon with
hugely regressive implications. It
favors kids whose parents can pay
for premium schooling, slams a
door on the poor and accelerates
inequality in the guise of meritoc-
racy.
For much of the past century,
logical reasons existed for the rise
of education. In 1900, a majority of
Americans still lived in rural areas,
and hardly one quarter graduated
high school. As we made the switch
from an agrarian society to a mostly
industrial one, specialized training
became more important for prepar-
ing workers for skilled jobs. Higher
education went from an elite privi-
lege to a necessary stepping stone
to a professional career. Like its
peers, the University exploded dur-
ing the post-WWII era, sprawling
onto North Campus and building
massive new residence halls such as

Markley, Bursley, South Quad and
East Quad.
Unfortunately, the U.S. never
made the same commitment to
free higher education that many
European nations did, even as a
bachelor's degree grew more vital
to professional success. When the
middle class started slipping in the
1970s, the relative necessity and
affordability of college was bound
to diverge. Today, a bachelor's
degree is probably as important
to decent employment as a high
school diploma was 50 years ago,
but it's hard to find one offered for
no charge.
To put it bluntly, our generation
got burned - and, of course, some
of us got burned more than others.
Stanford University sociolo-
gist David Grusky argues that we
are "rationing" college for the rich
through the high cost of tuition.
The result of the pay-to-play col-
lege game is a labor market very
far from free. Because we've made
college a prerequisite for full par-
ticipation, the whole economy is
rigged against those of us not born
into wealth.
Meanwhile, so-called "credential
inflation" isn't stopping. Master's
degrees are becoming the new bach-
elor's, a July New York Times article
observed. Does that imply soon the
Ph.D. will become the new master's?
Where will the educational arms
race end? When every office temp
needs a doctorate?
I've heard more than one student
say that they won't become "a real
person" until they finish school for
good. If that's true, just how long
will people in the future have to put
personhood on hold for a few let-
ters' sake?
For all the time and money, the
hyperextension of education would
make a certain amount of sense if
it produced more talented work-
ers with specialized superpowers

that previous generations could
only dream of. But, in the majority
of cases, I doubt that's happening.
Pundits regularly bemoan the state
of American undergraduate educa-
tion. While graduate students are
supposed to have a more definite
focus, I've heard plenty complain
they aren't learning much new
material. The trend toward dual
master's degrees on this campus
suggests that graduate professional
programs could become one more
grab bag of classes on the road to
credentials that stand largely as
ends in and of themselves.
"Credential
inflation" isn't
stopping.

The expansion of higher educa-
tion has also exacerbated compe-
tition in the lower grades to the
point of absurdity. "It has always
been difficult getting [admitted,]
but what's changed is the amount
of hassle," one New York education
consultant told the Times last year.
"Now test prep is de rigueur, and
you're applying to more schools."
She was talking about kindergar-
tens.
Learning is good. Expanded edu-
cation is good when it builds a more
intelligent, compassionate society.
But instead, the over-development
of education is engineering the ero-
sion of the middle class and our
generation's lives. Only policies
that level with that fact can put us
back on track.

Student-run station
balances tradition
and the Internet
By GEOFF MARINO
Daily Arts Writer
In the basement of the Stu-
dent Activities Building, nestled
alongside that dreaded area 'U'
students visit only after losing
their MCard, is the student radio
station, WCBN.
The station defines itself as:
"A student-run community free-
form radio station" that broad-
casts to the "University and its
surrounding communities." Of
course, what exactly freeform
entails is up to interpretation,
but in the world of radio, the
term brings to mind the model
of the longest-running freeform
radio station, New Jersey-based
WFMU. WCBN and WFMU pro-
vide DJs with total control over
the content of their shows.
WCBN has been operating
for about 40 years, and today's
increasingly Internet-based
music culture has put its philoso-
phy under pressure. With the
emergence of streaming services
and the music blog, the utility of
traditional radio is brought into
question. The average music lover
might think: Why should I have
music fed to me through radio
when my favorite blog and Pan-
dora can help me find what I like?
Rackham student Ben Yee,
general manager of WCBN,
revealed that he thinks Inter-
net music services such as Pan-
dora, Spotify, Grooveshark and
Turntable.fm aren't necessar-
ily competitors with WCBN and
that Internet music services and
freeform radio have separate
utilities.
"There's two different mind-
sets," Yee said. "I'll be honest,
there are times when I'm doing
work and I can't listen to WCBN
because it commands my atten-

tion. On the other hand, I can
go on Pandora, put in the names
of a few ambient artists, and let
it roll for five hours and I don't
even notice it's there."
Yet it's hard to know when a
listener might prefer the active
listening experience that the
station provides. Those Internet
services may be easier to shut out
than the unusual tracks found
on 88.3 FM, but individuals who
crave active listening can turn
on Pandora and be satisfied. In
clarifying its role, WCBN seeks
to offer more.
"We are the original music
blog," Yee said about the station's
role as he elaborated upon the
differences between freeform
radio DJs and music blogs. He
highlighted the personal aspect
of music discovery and its impor-
tance in balancing out the more
depersonalizing effects of the
Internet, citing a real-life encoun-
ter with a fan of a particular DJ,
Heidi Madagame, from WCBN.
"I went to Little Caesars Pizza

the other day, and someone
looked at my shirt and said, 'Hey,
you're with that radio station?
Yeah, that Heidi girl, she had a
great show the other day. I really
liked it.' The guy talked about
her for five minutes," Yee said.
WCBN prides itself on those
kinds of connections, valuing
the community aspect it can pro-
vide. Unlike Internet music sites,
in which the listener interacts
with a computer, WCBN wants
to foster the experience of com-
munal music listening.
But when asked whether
WCBN will embrace the Internet,
he stuck to his philosophy of inte-
gration rather than competition.
"A radio station isn't real-
ly going to succeed unless it
embraces the Internet," he said.
Ambitious developments
are planned. The station has
been authorized by the FCC to
increase its terrestrial transmit-
ting capacity from 300 watts to
2,000 watts, an effect that will
expand its reach to cover areas

such as Dexter, Ypsilanti, Celine
and even part of Chelsea.
This spirit of development
will be carried to the Internet. A
new website will allow listeners
to interact with the DJ and oth-
ers who are listening, fostering
interaction and group explora-
tion of music.
"Back in the day, listening to
music was a group experience,"
he said. "Being able to recreate
something like that, where peo-
ple can stop by, talk about the
music, and be able to figure out
from other people what's similar
out there, would be a way of cre-
ating a community around the
radio station."
These developments intend to
offer the greater Ann Arbor area
another option to explore music
interactively, and the zeal for
further expansion is certainly
there. When asked about the
future of WCBN, Yee expressed
optimism.
"We want to take over the
world," Yee said. '

once she's ready, she takes a
deep breath and remains poised,
instrument held aloft. A hush falls
over the crowd, and their eyes fix
eagerly on the performers. The
audience has no idea what they're
about to hear.
Then again - as an artist of
improvised music - neither does
she.
Tonight, the International
Society for Improvised Music
will pull together some of Ann
Arbor's most talented musicians
for a fundraiser as unpredictable

as the songs the artists will cre-
ate on a whim: a 24-hour impro-
vised musical extravaganza at
Canterbury House. The event
will feature spontaneous per-
formances by local professors,
students and residents, whose
unorthodox artistic passion
springs from their one-of-a-kind
musical methods.
"There's no pretense that this
is high art music," said Matt
Endahl, Canterbury House
musical director and a School of
Music, Theatre & Dance graduate
student. "This is music for which
the process is the interesting part
... because it's more of a direct
creative process than learning a
piece of music and then perform-
ing it."
The first and last performanc-
es of the fundraiser will be given
by members of MT&D's Creative
Arts Orchestra, while the rest
of the event will showcase the
colorful collection of Ann Arbor
improvisational talent, uniting to
create a truly eclectic experience.
"People will have a very wide
variety of instruments and also
a wide variety of opinions about
what it means to improvise
music rather than play composed
music," Endahl said.
Though the standards of
scripted music may dominate the
world of musical performance,
many devotees of get-togethers
and concerts that celebrate music
made on-the-spot enjoy exploring
the inner source of their artistic
inspiration.

Senior wrestler Zac Stevens has battled a lot to thrive at Michigan.

and had to play catch-up. Though
his character developed early, his
body wasn't physicallyup to par.
Michigan coach Joe McFarland
took a special interest in Stevens
and guided him to become the
wrestler he needed to be.
"The team views Zac and Joe
in a father-son relationship," said
redshirt freshman Jake Salazar.
But it's inevitable for fathers
and sons to occasionally, or fre-
quently, butt heads. Stevens said
it stems from their similarities,
but Salazar said it's almost out of
love. Either way, it's undeniable
that McFarland and Stevens share
a mutual respect for one another.
Stevens was honored for his
discipline and dedication to the
team - as a sophomore, he was
honored by being named the
youngest team captain in program
history, something he spoke about
with genuine appreciation. But he
deserved it, and earned that rec-
ognition on his own merit.
Stevens grew as an athlete, stu-
dent and teammate. With under-
classmen coming in each year, he
repaid the generosity he received.

He took Salazar under his wing
and their friendship blossomed. It
was his dutyto pass on the accep-
tance he received.
"People have always stepped
into mylife atthe right time," Ste-
vens said. "I've been very lucky."
Stevens maintains and cher-
ishes every relationship he has,
whether family by blood or by
bond. He acknowledged his girl-
friend, Christina Sbrocchi, and
her family for their kindness.
When talking about them, Zac
spoke as one does about their own
family-with sincerity.
Stevens calls Christina's moth-
er, Ann, a "stay-at-home super
mom." Over the years, Stevens
has faced obstacles, but he always
managed to grow from those
experiences. It was during his
hardest moments that Stevens
established some of his strongest
traits. Whatever curveball life
may throw next, Stevens will just
come out stronger, like every time
he comes off the mat.
"I feel that things will fall into
place," Stevens said. "They always
have."

Sophomore Shaun Bernstein helped Michigan win the match's doubles point.
Michigan scrapes by

ByIAN SHEETS
Daily Sports Writer
Starting three freshmen is
normally not a recipe for success.
But for the Michigan men's
tennis team, that recipe has
proven quite tasty.
The
fresh- LOUISVILLE 2
men trio MICHIGAN 5
of Michael
Zhu, Alex Petrone and Eli Brown
proved to be the difference for
the Wolverines (3-2 overall) on
Thursday in a 5-2 win over Lou-
isville (3-3).
The match began straight-
forwardly, with an 8-3 doubles
victory by the team's captains,
junior Evan King and sophomore
Shaun Bernstein.
Down 6-4, the No. 3 team of
Petrone and Zhu began to gain
ground in their set, aided by
some helpful errors by the oppo-
sition. Following a quick break
and two holds of serve, the team
found itself leading 7-6, on Lou-
isville's serve.
The ending was anticlimactic,
as Louisville double-faulted at
0-40 to end the match.
"That was the worst match
that Alex and Michael had
played," said Michigan coach
Bruce Berque. "Michael actu-
ally didn't play that well today,
even though he won both of
his matches. But he was able to
really step up for the team, and
I think that he sensed that he
needed to."
Following doubles play, the
Wolverines' lead was quickly
increased with easy wins by
nationally ranked No. 6 King
(6-0, 6-4) and Bernstein (6-4,
6-1) at No. 1 and No. 2 singles.
Bernstein found himself down
3-0 to start, but he hit his stride
early enough to turn it around.
"It's always nice to get in the
win column," Bernstein said. "I
think it was good that I ended
up gettingthrough a patchy start
and ended up finding my game a
little more there."
Louisville won the next two
matches to make things inter-
esting, with the deciding points
of the match being left to two
freshmen, Zhu and Brown.
An exchange of words from

Berque may have helped affect
the outcome.
"I walk over to Mike at one
point in the third, and I told him
that it's not looking that good,
and that I'm not trying to put
pressure on him, but he needs to
have the attitude that we need
his match," Berque said. "I think
that's when he kind of calmed
down a little bit and started
focusing on what he needed to
do to win the match, instead of
beating himself up so much."
With a new focus, Zhu found
his form and broke his oppo-
nent's serve at 4-3. Zhu then
went on. to exchange holds of
serve with his opponent for a 6-3,
1-6, 6-4 win.

Brown never lacked focus,

when he began to pressure, mov-

Eventually, after breaking

meaningful point that'll decide
the outcome of the match."
Going forward, the Wolver-
ines will rest assured that they
can perform better, despite
scraping by Louisville.
"I don't think everyone played
their best but I think we did a
great job of competing as a team
and that's huge, especially in our
fifth match of the season with
half our lineup being freshmen,"
Bernstein said.
"That's a great effort, and it's
just going to keep improving
from here."

Pipkins, Henry shore up 'D'-lmine omn-Wo1vpri
LohmanZ.EU . WoL..3. V'L Ver"ines.. L~

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
A kid named Pee-Wee is the
next big thing on the Michigan
defensive line.
Ondre "Pee-Wee" Pipkins, a
defensive tackle from St. Louis,
joined Willie Henry to form
Michigan's two-man interior
lineman haul on National Sign-
ing Day. The additions were
crucial for a defensive line that
graduated three senior starters
this month.
But the nickname is quite the
misnomer. Pee-Wee Pipkins is
a monster - a Scout.com five-
star who stands at 6-foot-3, 325
pounds.
The nickname came from
"Bdbd's Kids," a 1992 animated
comedy film.
"That baby reminds me of
Ondre," Pipkins' father joked,
referencing the wide-eyed,
diaper-wearing Pee-Wee on the
screen.
It fit. Back then, rooted in
Saginaw, Mich., Pipkins was the
little brother with a big heart.
And just like the kid on the
screen, he had a bigger strut and
swagger.
"I thought that was really
neat, I thought they made a
movie about me," Pipkins admit-
ted on Thursday. "They really
didn't. I misunderstood a couple
things."
After moving to Atlanta from
Saginaw, Pipkins returned to
Rochester Hills, Mich. to play
his freshman season of football.
The next year, he moved to Kan-
sas City for his final three years
of high school.
Pipkins always wanted to get
back to Michigan.
A year ago, Michigan recruit-
ing coordinator Jeff Hecklin-
ski took a trip to Park Hill High
School to meet Pipkins. It didn't
take much work to get Pipkins
on board.
"From that point on, I felt like
Michigan was where I was going
to end up," Pipkins said.
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison called Pipkins a gentle
giant with a "bubbly personal-
ity." But onlytff the field,
"He's a very happy person,"

Three out of four. That's the
number of Big Ten Diver of the
Week Awards senior Amanda
Lohman won in January.
After winning the award four
other times in her career, Lohm-
an nearly doubled that in just a
month.
Lohman's season started slow-
ly, but she's altered its course
since the Michigan women's
swimming and diving team won
on Jan. 7 against No. 8 Indiana.
With first-place finishes in
both the one- and three-meter
diving events, her dominating
performances were just begin-
ning.
Even with these awards in
hand, Lohman has not let the
accolades go to her head.
"It gives me alot of motivation
to keep doing what I'm doing,"
Lohman said. "(I can't) get com-
placent and just (have to) keep
working harder."
With the Big Ten Champion-
ships around the corner - Feb.
15-18 in Iowa City - it's a good
time for things to start clicking.
"I've kind of been on an
upward trend," Lohman said.
"It's all starting to come together
at the end, which I hope it will
still continue to do in the next
few weeks."
Interestingly enough, she
wasn't originally planning to
become a Wolverine. When look-
ing at colleges Michigan wasn't
Lohman's first choice.
But that all changed when
Lohman attended a Michigan
women's swimming and diving
meet and received a diving team
T-shirt.

"I always wore that to prac-
tice," Lohman said. "I don't
know if that was foreshadowing
to where I'd be coming. Michi-
gan was my first recruiting trip
and I just loved it."
As a senior, Lohman has a
chance to finish her divingcareer
strong - just as her team has
done, winning four of its last five
meets heading into Iowa City.
And if the team's past perfor-
mance in Iowa City is any indica-
tion, Big Tens could go well.
Lohman finished second in
one-meter diving and third in
both the three-meter and plat-
form diving events at the Hawk-
eye Invitational earlier this
season.
"It gives me a
lot of motivation
to keep doing
what I'm doing."
Her dives helped the Wolver-
ines take first place in the com-
petition.
Could history repeat itself for
Lohman and Michigan in the Big
Ten Championships?
Perhaps, but you won't find
Lohman or her teammates wor-
rying much about it, as Michigan
coach Jim Richardson stresses
the importance of taking each
meet as it comes.
That's exactly what the Wol-
verines plan to do, as they hope
Iowa City can be the site of
another special performance.
When asked how Richardson
tells the team to view the upcom-
ing challenge, Lohman respond-
ed that they'll have the same
mentality as anyothee-.meet

Michigan defense tries to slow Smith

The University of Michigan
boasts some of the top academic
programs in the world, but for the
Michigan men's tennis team, one
of the most important lessons was
reinforced last weekend on the
hard court - revenge is sweet.
Last April, the Wolverines
were bounced in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament by the
University of Maryland. But last
weekend, Michigan (3-2 overall)
got its revenge in a dominant 4-0
victory against the Terrapins at
the ITA Kick-Off Weekend in
Austin, Texas.
"It felt great to beat Maryland
after they beat us in the NCAA
Tournament last year," said soph-
omore Barrett Franks. "I thought
we worked hard to get to where
we were at the end of last season,
and then to lose the way we did, in
the first round, it was demoraliz-
ing. But I think it made everyone
hungry this year."
The Wolverines followed
up with a 5-2 win on Thursday
against Louisville.
This team is drastically differ-
ent from last year's edition. They
added three promising fresh-
men - including standout Alex
Petrone - to an already young
roster, which also features four
sophomores, one junior and no
seniors.
Having such a young team
has made the leadership of the
captains, junior Evan King and
sophomore Shaun Bernstein, all
the more important. Entering the
season everybody knew that King
was primed to be one of the top
players in the country, and he's
lived up to those expectations.
The uncertainty lay in the youth
and relative inexperience of the
rest of the roster.
Luckily for the Wolverines,
Bernstein stepped up and filled
the void.

ferent or too radical," Bernstein
said. "It's just the same stuff we
have been doing all along. We
have alot of freshmen, so it is very
important to lead by example."
Added Franks: "We're a young
team, and we started off slowly
at the beginning, but the fresh-
men have all meshed well into
(Michigan coach Bruce) Berque's
system."
"He leads by
example and
does a great job
of motivating."
Undoubtedly, the experience
and stability of King, combined
with the newfound leadership
from Bernstein, have helped enor-
mously in turning this young
squad into a team on the rise in
the Big Ten.
"The freshmen look up to
Shaun, they believe in what he
says," Franks said. "He leads by
example and does a great job of
motivatingthe team to win."
The Wolverines will try and
use the confidence they gained
in their shutout of Maryland, as
well as their win over Louisville,
against a solid LSU team (2-1)
on Saturday. Michigan will once
again lean on its captains to set
an example and lead the team to
victory.
"I think this team is great,"
Bernstein said. "We all have a lot
of fun with each other; we're a
really close group. There are no
dead spots: It's a good environ-
ment that stays light and fun. That
definitely helps us on the court."

One-for-2, 2-for-4 ... 3-for-5 in

In Miami (Ohio) forward Reilly
Smith, the No. 7 Michigan hockey
team will run into the confer-
ence's most prolific goal-scorer
in the middle of his tear through
the conference schedule. The two
teams will square off at Yost this
weekend.
"You just have to be aware of
a player like that," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson. "You know
he's a little extra gifted and a lit-
tle extra skilled. ... You've got to
respect what he can do on the ice."
Smith represents the piece
missing from the Michigan hock-
ey team this year.
The Wolverines are a more
complete team than the 18th-
ranked RedHawks. They have
better goaltending, more depth
and a better all-around offense.
So why does Miami keep beat-
ing Michigan?
This year, the RedHawks' only
advantage is Smith. Unlike Michi-
gan, Miami knows it has a go-to
scorer.
Whether Michigan will snap its
recent five-game winless streak
against Miami will hinge on its
ability to shut down the nation's

Sophomore defenseman Mac Bennett and the Michigan defensive corps will be tasked with slowing Reilly Smith.

third leading goal-scorer. The
first time the two teams met this
season, Smith scored twice in the
finale to help the RedHawks come
back from a two-goal deficit and
win ina shootout.
Just don't mention to Beren-
son that Michigan's last win over
Miami came two years ago, or that
the Wolverines have taken just
one out of the past eight match-
ups.
"Do you know what their
record is in Yost since (Miami
coach Enrico Blasi has) been
there?" Berenson asked. "3-and-
13. So wait until the weekend's
over, and then we'll talk about
who played well and who didn't."
No, there's no love lostbetween
the two CCHA rivals. Berenson
doesn't relish answering ques-
tions about Miami, and at the
end of his interview on Thursday,
he reiterated that the series isn't
about Miami, it's about whether
Michigan can play its game.
Smith and Blasi spoke highly
of Michigan, but that didn't stop
Smith from slipping in a little dig.
"You really just have to sti-
fle their offense," Smith said.
"They're definitely a run-and-
gun team, so the more you slow
them down, the more they'll get
frustrated and get down on their

teammates."
In the first game in Oxford,
Smith didn't need to contribute
anything. The Redhawks battered
Michigan in the game's opening
minutes, and before the shell-
shocked Wolverines could react,
Miami already held a 2-0 lead.
"It almost seemed like we were
afraid to play them," said sopho-
more defenseman Mac Bennett.
"They came out, and they played
physical."
Berenson said this series' open-
ing minutes will be just as critical,
but playing at home should give
Michigan an advantage. Dictat-
ing the tone and pace of the game
early on, according to Berenson,
has more to do with Michigan
playing its own game than any-
thing Miami does. It's a lot like
playing against Smith.
"You can respect players, but
you can't respect them too much,"
Bennett said, holding his hands
inches apart to demonstrate.
Much like Michigan, Miami
struggled earlier in the season,
losing five games in a row at one
point before rebounding during
CCHA play. The RedHawks have
won six of their past eight and sit
in second place in the conference,
four points ahead of the seventh-
place Wolverines.

Miami's biggest surprise of the
season has been the play of fresh-
man forward Austin Czarnik,
who has anchored Smith's line at
the center position, replacing last
year's Hobey Baker Award-win-
ner, Andy Miele. With Miele gone,
Smith has handled the puck more
often, and Czarnik has become an
effective distributor.
"His speed really gravitatesthe
defense toward him," Smith said.
"Czarnik has actually stepped
into (Miele's) role really well, and
it's amazing how well he's actu-
ally filled in Andy's spot."
Though Miami overwhelmed
Michigan early in the first match-
up this season, Smith said the
Redhawks will try to slow the
game down, especially at a place
like Yost, where Blasi said the
game can get away from you, and
quickly.
For many in the crowd and on
the Michigan bench, this series
will be about revenge. The Wol-
verines' underclassmen - over
half of the roster - have never
beaten Miami.
"I think we're taking this
weekend the same as the week-
end we took Ohio State the second
time around," Bennett said. "They
swept us the first time, and they
gotta pay for that."

up I-96 to face the ninth-ranked
Spartans (6-3,17-5).
The two schools' biggest pro-
grams - football and basketball
- have undergone a recent role
reversal. Michigan basketball will
try to match Michigan State foot-
ball's four-game win streak over
its archrival.
The forward will surely be
anxious to back up his word, but
how effectively he'll be able to do
so is the biggest storyline enter-
ing the game. In a loss Tuesday at
Illinois, Green, who was already
playing with the flu, suffered
what initially looked to be a seri-
ous knee injury.
Green had to be carried off the
court and emerged from Assem-
bly Hall on crutches, though an
MRI on Wednesday revealed the
injury was just a sprain and he's
officially listed as day-to-day.
He'll play Sunday, but it remains
to be seen how the knee will hold
up. An injured Green - the Spar-
tans' best player and their heart
and soul - gives the Wolverines
a leg up, but senior guard Zack
Novak doesn't want the game to
come down to that.
"I hope so," Novak said
Wednesday, when asked if he
wants Green to play. "You don't
want a kid to get hurt in his senior
year. You like to see everybody
play."

Following a two-game losing
streak - the first multiple-game
slide of the season for the Wol-
verines - the Michigan women's
basketball team rebounded with
a 79-68 vic-
tory against N'WESTERN 68
North- MICHIGAN 79
western on
Thursdaynight at Crisler Center.
The Wildcats aren't one of the
the conference's better teams, and
a Michigan loss would've been
devastating to the team's post-
season hopes.
"I thought our kids played
extremely hard to start and went
at them, where the last couple of
games we were very hesitant in
what we were going to do," said
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth.
"I thought we were a lot more
aggressive tonight offensively."
At one point in the first half,
the Wolverines went on an 18-3
run to put them up by 16. Michi-
gan took an 11-point lead into
halftime, shooting an impressive
51.9 percent from the floor. It also
used a ferocious defensive effort
to hold Northwestern to 38-per-
cent shooting from the field, and
just 22 percent from behind the
arc.
Coming out of the second half,
the Wildcats tied the game up at
44 with nine minutes left in the
game led by junior forward Dani-
elle Diamant. Diamant scored
13 second-half points on 3-for-4

's scored in any game this nitely have that."

But if history has its way, even
a healthy Green would struggle
against Michigan. The Wolver-
ines have used frequent double
teams in the post to stifle Green.
In seven games against Michi-
gan, the senior has averaged
just seven points. Three weeks
ago in Ann Arbor, he was held
to seven points - a season low
until the injury-shortened game
in Champaign - and five turn-
overs, which matched a season
high. Freshman point guard Trey
Burke scored a game-leading 20
points in the last go around, a
60-59 win, but has struggled in
tough road environments like
Ohio State's Value City Arena and
Indiana's Assembly Hall. Next up
for Burke is the Breslin Center
and its vaunted Izzone student
section, which has helped pro-
pel the Spartans to a 13-0 home
record.
"They're going to give us every-
thing they've got," Burke said.
"We beat them here and we're
on a roll there, so we know that
they're going to come out with all
types of intensities. It's goingto be
a personal game on Saturday."
On Wednesday, No. 23 Michi-

gan used a scorching start and
strong defense to knock off the
Hoosiers, 68-56, holding Indiana
22 points below its season aver-
age. The Wolverines will use the
impressive win to ride into East
Lansing with momentum.
"It definitely helps us out tre-
mendously, just to take what we
did on the defensive end, how
we boxed out and how we played
tough in the first half," said soph-
omore guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
"We can definitely take a lot of
things from that."
Michigan's win over the Hoo-
siers moved the Wolverines into
a tie for second place in the con-
ference, just a half game behind
the first-place Buckeyes and a half
game ahead of Michigan State.
With just three weeks remain-
ing in the regular season, the con-
gested standings make this game
crucial.
"We feel like every game from
here on out is a must-win game,
justbecauseyou cango from (No.)
2 or 3 in the Big Ten to (No.) 6 or 7
in a matter of a week," Burke said.
"We know that every single game
is probably playing for a Big Ten
Championship."

Senior guard
regains confidence
from beyond the arc
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth compared senior guard Car-
men Reynolds to Derek Jeter
after Thursday night's game
against North-
western. NOTEBOOK
How does
the New York Yankees' short-
stop compare to a women's col-
lege basketball player?
After failing to do so for sev-
eral games, Reynolds finally hit
her 183rd shot from behind the
arc to set the program record for
career 3-pointers.
Once she began to approach
the record, Reynolds began
to struggle offensively. Bors-
eth recognized her slump and
explained how the pressure sur-
rounding that milestone affect-
ed her game.
"(She has) had that laying
over her head the whole year,"
Borseth said. "(It's) nothing but
records, records, records, and
it's in her head. And all of a sud-
den, it's like Derek Jeter trying
to get his 3,000th hit. You have
a tough time getting it because
you're so anxious to do it, it
almost works against you.
"Well, that's over with. Hope-
fully tonight was a good sign
that that was done, and it's off
her mind now."
Reynolds seemed to have a
clear mind in Thursday's game,
shooting 3-for-5 from behind
the arc.
She finished with 11 points,
the first time she's scored in
double figures since Dec. 30
against Illinois in Michigan's
Big Ten opener.
