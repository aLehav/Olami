ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The Center of the City 
Task Force met at Larcom 
City Hall to discuss the 
planning stages of a new park 
in the center of Ann Arbor 
Wednesday afternoon. 
The 10-person municipal 
committee 
was 
designed 
to 
promote 
long-term 
beautification 
projects 
in 
Ann Arbor. The group first 

met on Aug. 1, after local 
voters approved Proposal A in 
November which designated 
the library lot between Fifth 
Avenue and Division Street as 
a space for the construction of 
a new community commons. 
Meghan Musolff, the chair 
of the task force, explained 
the group is still developing 
plans 
for 
the 
park’s 
construction 
and 
will 
be 
doing so over the next several 
months.
Bringing in support and 

input from the community in 
the next few months will help 
the project’s development, 
Musolff said.
“My goals for today are 
to 
really 
start 
thinking 
about how we engage the 
community in an inclusive, 
meaningful 
way, 
starting 
from where we are in the 
conversation,” Musolff said. 
“This group is really coming 
together to start thinking 
about the vision, and today 
… we (are) going to bring the 

community into the decision-
making process.”
While the Center of the 
City 
project 
ultimately 
gained approval via direct 
vote 
last 
November, 
task 
force members explained the 
idea has been in the works 
for several years. Alan Haber, 
task force member and local 
political activist, says the 
idea was originally shot down 
by the city over ten years ago. 

More than 50 students, 
faculty, poets and community 
organizers gathered in the 
Diag 
Wednesday 
evening 
for a protest reading and 
fundraising event through the 
national movement Writers 
for 
Migrant 
Justice. 
The 
movement is comprised of 
poets who joined together to 
raise money for organizations 
providing financial, legal and 
medical aid to detained or 
formerly-detained migrants.
The open-air event featured 
16 
speakers 
performing 
original poetry and literature, 
including poets and writers 
who were both students and 
faculty members.
Writers for Migrant Justice 
partnered with Immigrant 
Families 
Together, 
an 
organization that provides 
legal and financial support for 
those affected by immigrant 
issues, 
and 
the 
local 
organization One Michigan 
for Immigrant Rights, which 
provides support to immigrant 
communities 
through 

“organizing, education, and 
empowerment.”

Over 1,400 signatures gathered to reinstate coverage

The University of Michigan 
has installed security cameras in 
the main libraries on campus for 
the start of the fall semester. The 
additional safety measure is the 
result of a collaboration between 
the University Library and the 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security.
Though campus libraries are 
typically safe, crimes still occur, 
said Rebecca Dunkle, associate 
university librarian for library 
operations. 
“The libraries are generally 
very safe places, but we do have 
occasional groups of thefts,” 
Dunkle said. “Mostly when people 
leave their belongings unattended, 
but on rare occasions from 
library offices or labs when they 
are accidentally left unlocked. 
We hope the cameras will help 
prevent thieves from coming into 
the library at all and will help 
the Department of Public Safety 
identify perpetrators if a theft 
does occur.”
Dunkle explained the security 
cameras will only be placed in the 
Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library 
and the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library, the two biggest library 
buildings on campus and the 
locations of most past thefts.

An online petition asking 
the University of Michigan to 
bring back coverage of sexually 
transmitted infection testing at 
University Health Service began 
circulating online Wednesday. 

At the time of publication of 
this article, the petition had over 
1,400 signatures.
UHS 
and 
Michigan 
Medicine 
quietly 
introduced 
a new policy in July to bill a 
student’s insurance plan for 
laboratory 
testing, 
radiology 
x-rays 
and 
ultrasounds 
and 
allergy injections. Previously, 

a 
mandatory 
$199 
Health 
Service Fee paid by students 
through tuition covered these 
examinations. UHS said they 
implemented 
these 
changes 
“to keep the health service fee 
unchanged this year, despite 
significant increases in expenses.

There’s 
a 
cloud 
on 
the 
horizon 
for 
flavored 
e-cigarettes 
in 
Michigan, 
and it definitely doesn’t smell 
like mangoes. Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
hit 
juuls 
across 
Michigan hard on Wednesday, 
declaring 
a 
statewide 
ban 
on flavored nicotine vaping 
products.
Whitmer 
called 
on 
the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services 
to 
issue 
emergency 
rules, 
banning the sale of flavored 
e-cigarettes both in stores 
and online. The mandate also 
includes a ban on misleading 
marketing of vaping products 
that use terms like “clean” or 
“safe.” The ban will expire 
in six months, at which time 

Whitmer can decide to extend 
it. 
The ban makes Michigan 
the first state in the nation 
to bar the sale of flavored 
e-cigarettes. In a press release, 
Whitmer 
said 
she 
issued 
the order after Dr. Joneigh 
Khaldun, 
Michigan’s 
chief 
medical executive and chief 
deputy director for health at 
MDHHS, found that youth 
vaping constituted a public 
health emergency. In recent 
weeks, health officials have 
been investigating an outbreak 
of vaping-related lung illnesses 
across the country. 
“As governor, my number 
one priority is keeping our 
kids safe,” Whitmer said. “And 
right now, companies selling 

vaping products are using 
candy flavors to hook children 
on nicotine and misleading 
claims to promote the belief 
that these products are safe. 
That ends today.”
Data from the 2018 National 
Youth 
Tobacco 
Survey 
showed a 78 percent spike in 
e-cigarette use among high 
school students between 2017 
and 2018, with more than 3.6 
million kids currently using 
them in 2018.
Whitmer 
also 
ordered 
the 
Michigan 
Department 
of Transportation to double 
down 
on 
enforcement 
of 
existing state law prohibiting 
billboard advertising of such 
products.

The Kelsey Museum of 
Archaeology debuted a new 
exhibit titled “Graffiti as 
Devotion along the Nile: 
El-Kurru, Sudan” on August 
23. The exhibit focuses on 
approximately 600 graffiti 
artifacts found at the site of 
El-Kurru in ancient Kush, 
located in modern day Sudan. 
Geoff 
Emberling, 
co-curator of the exhibit, 
said the project began when 
a 
group 
of 
researchers 
traveled to Sudan in 2015, 
expecting to find an ancient 
royal city. 
“We found a temple and 
started seeing these graffiti 
and that was not what we 
went looking for at all,” 
Emberling said. “But that’s 
what archaeology is all about: 

finding the unexpected.” 
The exhibit also features 
information 
about 
the 
graffiti and the culture of 
ancient Kush. Visitors can 
read about how the graffiti 
relates 
to 
the 
region’s 
religion, trade and tradition 
of pilgrimage. 
There 
are 
various 
multimedia 
elements 
in 
the 
exhibit, 
including 
a 
soundscape 
of 
ancient 
Kush 
and 
an 
interactive 
simulation of the reflection 
transformation 
imaging 
researchers used to analyze 
the graffiti. This technology 
compiles approximately 30 
photos taken of the graffiti 
with different amounts of 
light and creates one file. 
Using this file, researchers 
can 
examine 
how 
light 
affects the visibility of the 
graffiti. The exhibit also 

features a map of the region 
printed on the floor.
Rackham students Caitlin 
Clerkin and Shannon Ness 
explained how they believed 
multimedia impacts visitors’ 
experiences 
and 
deepens 
their 
connection 
to 
the 
exhibit. 
“We 
think 
that 
these 
elements help to bring a 
visitor a little closer to the 
reality of a place,” Clerkin 
said. 
“For 
us, 
the 
map 
provides a sense of geography 
as well as a reminder that the 
Nile ties some of these locales 
together. 
The 
soundscape 
gives a little sense of human 
activity, and brought us, as 
visitors, into the site and 
village.” 
Emberling 
said 
he 
hopes 
visitors 
will 
gain 
a 
deeper 
knowledge 
and 
understanding 
of 
ancient 
African civilizations. 
“I think the ancient 
civilizations of Africa 
don’t 
get 
as 
much 
attention in the public 
eye as they deserve,” 
Emberling said. “I hope 
people will become a 
little more aware of 
their complexity and 
cultural achievements.”
He 
also 
compared 
ancient Kush to the 
modern-day 
United 
States, 
explaining 
that understanding a 
culture solely through 
its elites is problematic. 
“Most of our ideas 
about 
history 
come 
from 
the 
elite 
and 
that’s not a satisfactory 
way 
to 
understand 
any 
culture, 
even 
our own,” Emberling 
said. “The graffiti art 
are 
important 
and 
interesting in the sense 
that they are marks left 
by individual people.” 
LSA junior Madeline 
Topor, president of the 
Student 
Archaeology 

Club, said she believes the 
study of ancient civilizations 
is especially relevant today. 
“Studying things from the 
past is a way to learn about 
where we came from,” Topor 

said. “How it shaped the 
world we are living in today 
and how traditions from the 
past are still carried on in 
the present.” 
This winter, researchers 
will 
be 
continuing 
the 
project, relocating to the 
capital of ancient Kush. The 
Kelsey Museum is hosting 
various events related to this 
exhibit, including an opening 
lecture on Sept. 5, a curator’s 
tour on Sept. 8 and a half-day 
symposium on Sept. 20.

International diplomacy

Friday, September 06, 2019 
1:30 - 3:00 pm

Rackham Amphitheatre (4th Floor)
915 E. Washington St.

 

Hosted as part of the Ford School's Conversations Across Difference Initiative. 
Co-sponsored by the Nam Center for Korean Studies.

According to the University 
Library’s announcement, the 
cameras will only be installed 
in entrances, exits, elevator 
lobbies and stairwell landings. 
They will be carefully placed 
in order to protect the privacy 
of library goers. 
Despite 
the 
limited 
placement of the cameras, 
they will still be instrumental 
in helping DPSS solve reported 
crimes, DPSS deputy chief of 
police Melissa Overton wrote 
in an email to The Daily.
“Security cameras can be 
a useful tool used to identify 
those in the facilities if a crime 
has been committed and a 
suspect description or time 
frame of the crime has been 
identified,” Overton wrote.
Engineering junior Hadley 
Peterson had her wallet stolen 
at the Graduate Library last 
February. She said she briefly 
left her belongings alone in 
a cubicle in the stacks, then 
came back to find her wallet 
missing. Due to the secluded 
nature of the stacks, no one 
else saw the theft. 
“I was up in Hatcher on the 

fifth floor,” Peterson said. “It 
was the morning of one of my 
exams. I was studying, and I 
just kind of figured I could run 
to the bathroom real quick, 
and so I was only gone for a 
couple of minutes, and then 
when I came back, all my stuff, 
like my backpack, was opened 
up. Of course, no one saw 
anything.”
Peterson said she turned 
to look for the potential 
perpetrator and saw a tall man 
leaving with her blue wallet 
sticking out of his pocket, but 
he went down a side stairwell 
before she could confront him. 
She then called the police 
and tried to get it sorted out, 
but because there were no 
cameras at the time, not much 
could be done.
“I just called the police and I 
ended up talking to an officer,” 
Peterson said. “They weren’t 
able to really help much with 
the case because there wasn’t 
really much to do other than 
get a description, and it’s not 
really the sort of thing that 
will get resolved typically.” 
Peterson said the addition 
of the cameras might have 
helped her get her wallet back 
and feel more secure because 
DPSS could potentially use 

them to identify a face. 
Dunkle said the University 
Library 
is 
dedicated 
to 
student 
privacy, 
and 
the 
reason the cameras are placed 
strategically is to protect the 
students in their work. She 
said neither the University or 
DPSS will actively watch or 
check the security cameras, 
and they will only be used in 
the case of a criminal incident. 
“We do not want to know 
what people are looking at 
in the library, what subjects 
they are studying, what print 
or online resources they are 
looking at, who they are sitting 
with or generally anything 
else they are doing,” Dunkle 
said. “We are careful to install 
the cameras where they will 
record people coming and 
going in the stairwells and 
entrances 
but 
not 
record 
what they are looking at on a 
computer screen or checking 
out at a service desk.”
Peterson 
said 
she 
isn’t 
sure if she would appreciate 
more cameras in the main 
study areas of the library. She 
explained she prefers to have 
her computer activity private 
for security reasons, but could 
see the importance of cameras 
in terms of catching a thief. 

SECURITY

Many 
students 
have 
insurance 
coverage 
through their parents, and 
when plans are billed, an 
Explanation of Benefits is 
often sent to the insurance 
policy holder to detail the 
services provided at UHS. 
If students want to avoid 
this, they have the option to 
pay for STI testing out-of-
pocket. The fee is $90.
In the comments of the 
petition and on social media, 
students wrote about the 
importance of accessibility 
of STI testing, especially for 
those in vulnerable medical 
situations and in the context 
of the University’s Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion goals. 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Kaleb Clover signed the 
petition. 
Clover 
said 
he 
recently came out as gay, 
and explained to The Daily 
if these changes had been 
made before he had came 
out, he would not have 
gotten tested for STIs. He 
would have feared his family 
would know he was gay and 
sexually active before he felt 

comfortable telling them.
“I wasn’t going to have 
them (my parents) know 
before I wanted them to 
know,” Clover said.
Information 
junior 
Harrison 
McCabe 
also 
signed the petition and noted 
his 
disappointment 
with 
UHS 
Executive 
Director 
Dr. Robert Ernst. Ernst told 
The Daily last week students 
should consider obtaining 
their 
“own 
personal 
health 
insurance 
plan” 
if 
they’re 
uncomfortable 
with their parents finding 
out about STI testing from 
an 
insurance 
statement. 
McCabe felt Ernst didn’t 
take insurance accessibility 
into account when making 
those recommendations. 
“I thought that comment 
about how students should 
get their own insurance 
was 
very 
insulting 
and 
condescending 
because 
it’s not that easy to find 
insurance,” McCabe said. 
“Looking at me, I’ve had a 
lot of chronic health issues 
and I’ve gone through a lot 
of insurances and it’s been 
very difficult for me.” 
The 
University 
does 
offer a health insurance 

plan through the Blue Care 
Network of Michigan. The 
cost for a full-year plan 
for domestic students is 
$1,709 annually with a $100 
deductible. 
McCabe 
also 
said 
he 
wonders why the services 
were being cut in light of 
increasing tuition rates. 
“My tuition has gone up 
every year since I’ve gone 
here,” McCabe said. “Why 
are you cutting the cost 
when we’re paying more? 
We’re paying more for less.” 
In an earlier interview 
with The Daily, Ernst said 
billing changes were a result 
of creating new revenue 
streams for UHS. 
“In the context of being 
asked 
to 
stay 
creative, 
stay innovative, and hold 
increases 
in 
the 
health 
service fees to a minimum, 
the easiest first step is to let 
the hospital bill what they’re 
doing, instead of us just 
paying for them,” Ernst said.
University spokesperson 
Rick Fitzgerald told The 
Daily the University was 
aware of the petition but had 
no new information to add at 
this time.

Migrant 
Justice 
co-organizer and Helen 
Zell 
Writers’ 
Program 
visiting 
professor 
in 
poetry, opened the event 
by explaining the group’s 
background 
and 
its 
mission within a national 
context.
“This 
started 
as 
a 
nationwide 
movement 
when a few poets got 
together 
and 
thought, 
‘Hey, 
while 
America 
has always been a fairly 
inhospitable 
place 
to 
a 
bunch 
of 
varieties 
of 
people, 
this 
is 
an 
especially 
cruel 
and 
brutal period of time in 
America for folks who are 
migrants seeking refuge 
and immigrants and racial 
minorities,’” Chakraborty 
said. “We wanted to raise 
some money to benefit 
some organizations that 
were directly targeting 
and trying to ameliorate 
the worst effects of this.”
Brittany Rogers, one of 
the evening’s performers, 
teaches in Detroit Public 

Schools 
in 
addition 
to her work as a poet. 
Rogers 
commented 
on 
the urgency of donating 
money to organizations 
that support immigrant 
communities.
 “A lot of our students 
come 
from 
migrant 
families,” 
Rogers 
said. “Seeing how our 
students are affected by 
(immigration 
issues) 
is 
one of the hardest things 
for us to watch.”
Samantha 
Magdaleno, 
director of One Michigan, 
elaborated 
on 
the 
continued 
necessity 
of the local support to 
immigrant 
communities 
her organization provides. 
“A lot of folks, since 
(immigration issues are) 
popular 
on 
the 
news 
now, they’re like ‘I want 
to do something, I want 
to get involved in it,’” 
Magdaleno said. “And all 
this money is going to new 
(organizations), who are 
kind of thinking they’re 
reinventing 
the 
wheel, 
right — but we’ve been 
doing this work, and we’ve 
been having strategies in 
place, and we have these 

connections.”
Many 
of 
the 
poems 
and 
short 
literature 
pieces focused on themes 
regarding 
migration, 
oppression, 
cultural 
belonging, undocumented 
experiences 
and 
first-
generation experiences in 
the United States. 
 LSA sophomore Hannah 
Martin attended the event 
and said she particularly 
resonated with one poet’s 
commentary 
on 
the 
absurdity of referring to a 
human being as “illegal.”
“How can you be that 
when you’re everything 
this country’s built on?” 
Martin said. “That was a 
very, very powerful piece 
that I would love to hear 
again.”
The 
group 
hosted 
more 
than 
40 
similar 
fundraising events across 
the country on Sept. 4, 
with the goal of raising 
$5,000. By the time the 
final speaker performed 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan event, Michigan 
Writers 
for 
Migrant 
Justice had raised nearly 
$2,000.

“In 2009, the city put out 
a request for proposals as (to) 
what should happen on top of 
the parking structure, and at that 
time I and another person with 
a larger group put in a proposal 
for the Ann Arbor community 
commons,” Haber said. “The 
city, under the table, had decided, 
already, that this was going to be 
a kind of conference center ... So 
our proposal for a community 
commons was not considered 
nor another proposal for a town 
square.”
LSA senior Hannah Boettcher 
is the sole University of Michigan 
student 
voice 
on 
the 
task 
force. Boettcher is a part of the 
Roosevelt Institute, a think tank 
and campus network at U-M 
focused on public policy. The 
Institute originally campaigned 
against the proposal, instead 
advocating for an affordable 
housing complex at the same 
location.
“The 
alternative 
to 
the 
Proposal A in the center of 
the city would have been an 
affordable housing building,” 
Boettcher said. “So we as a 
student body took the opinion 
that affordable housing near 
campus would have been more 
beneficial, not only to students, 
but also to the community at 
large.”
Following the approval of 
Proposal A, Boettcher applied 
to be on the committee in order 
to represent the student body 

and ensure the project took all 
community members’ needs into 
account.
“All that aside, I’m interested as 
a student on this project, because 
it does lie in the intersection 
of 
student 
neighborhoods,” 
Boettcher 
said. 
“There 
are 
student neighborhoods pretty 
much all around this location, 
so to me it’s really important to 
have a student voice representing 
this so it doesn’t become another 
wasteland park in the middle of 
downtown that nobody uses.”
At the top of the agenda on 
Wednesday 
was 
community 
engagement, and members of 
the task force proposed several 
tactics to gather local support 
and inform the community.
Heather Seyfarth, an Ann 
Arbor city planner, suggested 
several methods of increasing 
awareness, 
including 
invite 
letters, 
town 
social 
media 
accounts, holiday letters and 
posting flyers across town. 
However, 
Councilmember 
Chip Smith, D-Ward 5, warned 
against the use of mailings to 
consolidate community support, 
explaining they tend to be less 
effective than other means of 
spreading information. 
“It’s been my experience, 
because I do this work for a living 
and I’ve organized more than a 
few political campaigns, that we 
shouldn’t spend any money on 
mailings,” Smith said. “Mailings 
don’t generate any feedback, they 
don’t get people to meetings, 
generally if they’re looked at at 
all, they’re quickly tossed in the 
recycling bin. I think we need 

to prioritize what’s going to be 
the most effective way to reach 
the different populations we’re 
trying to reach for each event.”
The task force also set out 
goals for the next several months 
of project development. By the 
end of October, the committee 
hopes to complete outreach to 
the public and members of the 
community who have vested 
interests in the project. During 
November 
and 
December, 
a 
public 
proposal 
will 
be 
written, and by February, final 
discussions will be had about 
gaining approval from the Ann 
Arbor City Council. 
While 
members 
of 
the 
committee are eager to see the 
projects progress in the next 
few months, Boettcher explains 
she has some reservations about 
the task force’s composition. 
Boettcher says the multitude 
of city planners and local 
officials on the task force gives 
it a diversity of opinion, though 
not 
necessarily 
of 
race 
or 
socioeconomic background.
“I’m disappointed in the 
lack of minority voices, when 
we’re talking about the ethnic 
diversity and the racial diversity 
of this task force, and likely the 
socioeconomic diversity of this 
task force,” Boettcher said. 
“I don’t think it’s been well-
considered that this is an 
area downtown that maybe 
is not the most welcoming 
to all walks of life. That’s 
disappointing in that regard, 
but I think we’re mindful of 
that, and I think we all have a 
vision of inclusivity.”

TASK FORCE

Khaldun 
commended 
Whitmer for her move to 
block the sale of flavored 
e-cigarettes.
“In the past few years, we’ve 
seen an explosive increase in 
the number of Michigan kids 
exposed to vaping products,” 
Khaldun said. “This is a public 
health crisis. These products 
can contain harmful chemicals 
that put our kids’ health at risk. 
I’m looking forward to working 
with Governor Whitmer to 
mitigate these effects and keep 
our kids healthy.”
Though the University of 
Michigan is deemed a smoke-
free 
campus, 
e-cigarettes 
are popular on campus. LSA 
junior Blake Richards owns a 
Juul electronic cigarette and 
said he is trying to use it less 
because of the negative health 
effects. 
“Juul 
already 
stopped 
selling fruit flavors so I’m not 
really affected by that, but 
people like my brother would 
probably be pissed,” Richards 
said. “From my experience the 
addiction is strong enough that 
if people have already started 
smoking this (ban) won’t stop 
them. But it could probably 
make it much less attractive for 
non smokers to start smoking.”
The ban goes into effect 
immediately, giving retailers 
30 days to days to comply with 

the mandate. 
In a statement, Juul Labs, 
a popular e-cigarette startup 
based in San Francisco, said 
the company had not reviewed 
Whitmer’s order, but supports 

guidelines from the Food and 
Drug Administration calling 
for 
more 
restrictions 
on 
e-cigarettes and that “strong 
and serious actions need to be 
taken around certain flavored 
products.”
“There is simply no place 
for kid-appealing flavors in the 
marketplace,” the statement 
reads.. “That is why we would 
also support an outright ban 

on such flavors, including 
those that mimic kid-specific 
candies, foods, and drinks.”
The statement also said Juul 
Labs backs laws prohibiting 
minors 
from 
purchasing 
tobacco, but added electronic 
nicotine 
delivery 
systems 
can help people quit smoking 
traditional 
combustible 
cigarettes, 
a 
claim 
that 
has 
faced 
scrutiny 
from 
scientists 
and 
researchers. 
While 
e-cigarettes 
are 
often marketed as smoking 
alternatives, the FDA has not 
formally certified them as 
cessation aids.
In June, Whitmer signed a 
senate bill, which banned the 
sale of e-cigarettes to minors, 
and another senate bill, which 
mandated electronic nicotine 
delivery systems be sold in 
child-proof 
containers 
and 
“vapor products or alternative 
nicotine products” sold in 
retail stores be kept behind the 
counter.
In a press release, Michigan 
Attorney General Dana Nessel 
praised Whitmer for instating 
the ban.
“With a more than 1.5 
million increase in the number 
of students using vaping 
products in just one year, 
the governor’s emergency 
actions today are exactly 
the bold measures we must 
take to protect Michigan’s 
children from the dangerous 
effects of vaping,” Nessel 
said in the press release. 

While e-cigarettes 
are often marked 
as smoking 
alternatives, the 
FDA has not 
formally certified 
them as cessation 
aids

S

ince its introduction by 
U.S. Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., 
earlier this year, the Green 
New Deal — a sweeping 
proposal 
for 
widespread 
climate-centric 
reforms 
— has dominated political 
discussion on climate policy. 
I believe climate change is 
probably the most pressing 
and 
consequential 
issue 
facing the United States. I 
also oppose the Green New 
Deal. 
Perhaps those statements 
seem 
contradictory, 
and 
perhaps “oppose” is a bit 
strong; 
implementing 
the 
GND is far better than doing 
nothing, and several of the 
plan’s components — such 
as modernizing our nation’s 
infrastructure and investing 
in renewable energy — are long 
overdue. I, along with many 
others on the center-left, am 
strongly skeptical that the 
Green New Deal is the right 
path forward. While many left-
wing critics of the GND point 
to its political impracticality, 
the plan’s substance is equally 
concerning.
It’s difficult to estimate 
the 
quantitative 
effect 
the GND would have 
on 
carbon emissions, since the 
resolution 
Ocasio-Cortez 
introduced 
was 
more 
of 
a 
vague 
outline 
than 
a 
detailed piece of legislation. 
What is clear is that the 
GND is a hodge-podge of 
command-and-control 
style 
regulations such as building 
a high-speed rail network to 
“eliminate the need for air 
travel” and “upgrading all 
existing buildings” for energy 
efficiency. These proposals 
are bold ideas, but they will 
inefficiently, 
and 
perhaps 
insufficiently, 
reduce 
our 
carbon emissions. 
The solution is far simpler: 
Carbon 
pricing 
through 
either a carbon tax or a cap-
and-trade system, which are 
the most efficient and cost-
effective 
ways 
to 
reduce 
emissions. Carbon emissions, 
as any economist can tell you, 
are a classic externality. This 
means they have external 
social costs (including, for 
example, 
sea-level 
rise, 
extreme weather, health risks 
and much more) but emitters 
do not pay for — and therefore 
don’t consider — these costs 
when deciding how much to 
emit. This leads to excessive 
emissions 
of 
greenhouse 
gases. 
Taxing carbon emissions 
at the rate of the social cost 
of these emissions will lead 
to a socially optimal amount 
of emissions, which will be 

lower than current amounts. 
A cap-and-trade system works 
similarly, but instead of setting 
the price of carbon emissions 
and letting the market figure 
out the quantity, a cap-and-
trade plan caps the quantity of 
emissions by issuing permits 
to emit and letting the market 
trade permits and decide their 
price. 
Ideally, 
either 
plan 
would be revenue neutral: All 
government revenue from the 
tax or selling permits would 
be rebated to lower-income 
communities to assist with 
potentially high energy costs 
or 
invested 
in 
renewable 
energy technology.

There are still finer details 
to work out under either 
system — calculating the social 
cost of carbon to determine 
the 
ideal 
tax 
amount, 
covering 
other 
greenhouse 
gases like methane, creating 
a border carbon adjustment 
for imported goods, among 
others — but compared to 
other policy priorities like 
reducing poverty or fixing the 
health care system, solving 
climate change is tantalizingly 
achievable. 
Moreover, 
carbon 
pricing 
is 
more 
easily incorporated into an 
international system, which 
is critical since international 
collaboration 
and 
globally 
coordinated 
policies 
are 
essential 
to 
solve 
climate 
change.
For all the Green New 
Deal’s bold ideas, noticeably 
absent is any carbon pricing 
proposal. 
Some 
proponents 
point to a line briefly stating 
the need to “account for the 
true cost of emissions,” as a 
reference to carbon pricing, 
but 
this 
vague 
statement 
hardly 
constitutes 
a 
true 
proposal.
Ocasio-Cortez 
confirmed 
the absence of carbon pricing 
in statements to NPR, in which 
she said that a carbon tax or 
cap-and-trade plan would be 
at most a “tiny part” of the 
GND and be initially “off the 
table.” She continued to say 
that carbon pricing “misses 
the point” and “assumes the 
existing market will solve this 
problem for us.”

This characterization of 
carbon pricing is egregiously 
inaccurate 
and 
borderline 
nonsensical. Carbon pricing 
doesn’t “assume the existing 
market will solve the problem 
for us” — it recognizes the 
failure of the current market 
to address emissions. The 
whole point of carbon pricing 
is to intervene with sensible 
taxes or emission caps to 
allow market forces to reduce 
emissions 
in 
a 
way 
that 
maximizes 
efficiency 
and 
minimizes economic loss. Keep 
in mind that these answers 
were 
prepared, 
written 
statements, not off-the-cuff 
remarks — they represent a 
grave flaw in Ocasio-Cortez’s 
understanding 
of 
climate 
policy, 
not 
an 
innocent 
misstatement. 
It is discouraging to see 
so 
many 
other 
Democrats 
abandon 
market-based 
solutions to climate change. 
Despite the fact that the 
most 
promising 
state-level 
and 
international 
climate 
plans are carbon tax and cap-
and-trade systems, through 
four rounds of Democratic 
debates, 
each 
of 
which 
devoted time to discussing 
climate change, only U.S. Sen. 
Kirsten 
Gillibrand, 
D-N.Y., 
and former U.S. Rep. John 
Delaney, D-Md., brought up 
market-based carbon pricing 
mechanisms. 
Lastly, 
a 
carbon 
tax 
proposal is far more practical 
to pass than the GND. Far-left 
Democrats have grown fond 
of scoffing at the importance 
of practicality, but the hard 
truth is that a climate plan 
is virtually meaningless at 
this stage unless it can be 
enacted. The GND has met 
universal 
opposition 
from 
Republicans and several red-
state Democrats. It is frankly 
unpassable, even if Democrats 
manage to retake the Senate 
and the White House in 2020.
Passing a carbon pricing 
plan will also be difficult 
but far more realistic. The 
late Senator John McCain 
supported 
a 
cap-and-trade 
system 
during 
his 
2008 
presidential campaign, and an 
admittedly imperfect carbon 
tax bill in the House has 
Democratic and Republican 
co-sponsors. While those on 
the far-left jeer at market 
solutions, they’d be wise to 
remember the urgency of 
climate change. We only have 
time for one major push to get 
emissions under control, and 
it’s imperative we get it right. 

NOAH HARRISON | COLUMN

The substantive flaw of the Green New Deal

I

f you have followed the news 
the last couple weeks, you 
have seen loads of articles 
predicting economic Armageddon. 
It is possible the media’s hysteria 
may 
have 
tangible 
negative 
economic 
impacts, 
but 
I 
am 
sufficiently stressed, so I will join 
the chorus. A brief disclaimer: All of 
this terror is preemptive. Economic 
trends can change, and if they do, 
this article and the anxiety that 
bred it would be rendered moot. And 
always remember that economists 
have a less than stellar record when 
it comes to predicting recessions. 
But, for now, the stress is real! 
And if the forecasters are right, 
we — college students — will 
disproportionately feel it. Over the 
last year, pessimism about the U.S. 
economy’s outlook has become 
routine as the stock market has 
fluctuated along with President 
Donald Trump’s tariff whims. But 
this is different. On Aug. 14 the yield 
curve inverted, meaning the interest 
rates on 10-year government bonds 
were lower than those for two-year 
bonds. In other words, the market 
began thinking the U.S. economy’s 
long-term outlook was less risky 
than its short-term. That set off lots 
of alarms. The last six inversions 
of the yield curve each preceded 
a recession. The typical lag time? 
Between one and two years, meaning 
many current college students could 
very likely enter a recessionary 
economy post-graduation. As young 
people entering the labor market, 
a recession would have a serious 
impact on our futures — more than 
any other generation.
Academic 
research 
shows 
that graduates entering the labor 
force during a recession are kind of 
screwed. They are more likely to be 
unemployed, since firms hire less 
during recessions. If someone does 
manage to land their first job, they 
are more likely to be overqualified 
for it because firms become more 
risk averse. And those impacts 
last. Initial overqualification has 
long term consequences since it 
can delay promotion and reduce 
motivation. Recession graduates 
also have lower starting salaries, 
and though the gap is modest, it 
persists for approximately 10 to 15 
years after labor market entry. 
Those 10 to 15 years of 
diminished income matter, and 

research shows they impact the 
rest of recession graduates’ lives. By 
the time the income gap fades, key 
personal financial decisions may 
have been delayed or abandoned. 
For example, recession graduates 
are less likely to be married, have 
children, buy a home or car. They 
also start saving for retirement 
later. 
The impacts are also behavioral. 
Not to get too morbid, but recession 
graduates are more likely to die in 
middle age. It is not clear why. One 
suggestion is financial precarity 
throughout the first 10 to 15 years of 
work leads to less healthy lifestyle 
choices. The other possibility is 
without consistent or challenging 
work, an unstable transition from 
school into the labor market makes 
it more difficult to shed unhealthy 
habits from school, like binge 
drinking or poor sleep habits. No 
matter the cause, it is not a happy 
picture. 

Recessions disproportionately 
impact 
many 
demographic 
groups, not just college graduates. 
According to an ACLU report, 
by 2031, the Great Recession will 
have reduced the wealth in Black 
households by 29 percent more 
than in white ones. Furthermore, 
a 
higher 
proportion 
of 
low-
income households reported they 
were in worse shape after the 
Great Recession than wealthier 
households. And though college 
graduates suffer, recessions are far 
more destructive for high school 
graduates 
entering 
the 
labor 
market. 
The possibility of graduating 
into a recession would be a 
bummer if it was part of the natural 
economic cycle, but it is particularly 
frustrating because this potential 
recession has been expedited. The 
first and most obvious preventable 
cause is President Trump’s trade 

war with China, which has raised 
consumer prices and unsettled 
investors. The second attainable 
way to prevent or delay recessions 
in countries with labor shortages is 
to increase immigration. Much of 
the international economic anxiety 
is over reports of recessions in 
developed economies experiencing 
population loss, like Japan, United 
Kingdom and Germany (also the 
United States). Yet none of them have 
meaningfully increased immigration 
to fill open jobs. Meanwhile, at the 
time of this writing, the Trump 
administration is denying that we 
may be headed towards a recession 
for political purposes and has thus 
ignored any of the preventative steps 
it could take. 
The potential that we may 
be 
recession 
graduates 
thanks 
to our government’s economic 
mismanagement has filled me with 
a lot of frustration for the past couple 
weeks, but in the research, there is a 
silver lining. Recession graduates are 
on average happier than labor market 
entrants into a healthy economy. 
The theory behind the data is 
recession graduates are just grateful 
to be working and spend less time 
thinking about other possible career 
paths. Recession graduates also 
seem to be less narcissistic, perhaps 
because they had to overcome 
more hardship during their initial 
working years. These attitudes can 
have tangible manifestations. CEOs 
who were recession graduates were 
less likely to commit a certain kind 
of business fraud (backdating stock 
options) ubiquitous at the turn of 
the century. 
How the economy fares over 
the next couple years will likely have 
a disproportionately large impact 
on the rest of our lives. If things go 
poorly, our bad graduation timing 
will limit our generation in many 
tangible ways. That is scary, but 
ultimately beyond our direct control. 
What is partly under our control 
is how we approach the work we 
are doing. Instead of letting fear 
and frustration consume us, we 
should focus on channeling the 
philosophy that recession graduates 
hold: An appreciation of the work 
we do, regardless of the economic 
conditions around us.

A

s the 2020 presidential 
election rears its head 
over America, so does the 
bitter tension and frustration that 
arose from the aftermath of the 
2016 election. After 2016’s Election 
Day, 
businessman 
President 
Trump claimed the presidency 
through the Electoral College, but 
former Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton defeated Trump through 
the popular vote. This situation 
reignited a nationwide debate 
about the efficacy of the Electoral 
College. And that very same debate 
has reappeared as the 2020 election 
begins. 
Mainstream 
Democratic 
candidates vying for the 
presidency — including U.S. Sen. 
Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., U.S. 
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and 
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. 
— have expressed some desire 
to outright abolish the Electoral 
College. Other Democrats like 
entrepreneur 
Andrew 
Yang 
admit that the Electoral College 
is antiquated to some extent. 
With this growing opinion on the 
Electoral College, it is important 
to recognize not only its origins, 
but also how the Electoral College 
still fulfills its purpose within 
the current American political 
battlefield. 
In 
Doug 
Linder’s 
“The 
Electoral College Debate,” he 
recognizes that the Electoral 
College provides states “a role … 
in the selection of the president, 
(reminding) us of their importance 
in our federal system.” Some 
would argue that the Electoral 
College is counterintuitive to the 
democratic values of the United 
States. Linder cites in the same 
article, a “a vote by a resident of 
Wyoming counts about four times 
more — electorally — than a vote 
by a California resident.” 
Though true in the context 
of the electorate, that does not 
mean that small states like 
Wyoming hold disproportionate 
and absolute federal power over 
larger states like California. The 
entire framework of the U.S. as a 

democratic republic was designed 
to divide power, and the Electoral 
College and the presidency are 
only allocated a slice of that power. 
The electorate champions America 
as a republic, and institutions 
like the House of Representatives 
champion America as a democracy. 
The outright failure to recognize 
or even consider why the Electoral 
College 
distributes 
power 
to 
states in such a way demonstrates 
a 
limited 
understanding 
that 
American politics expands far 
beyond the presidency. 

Look back to the 2016 election. 
In an infographic published by 
The New York Times, it showed 
that Clinton won the popular vote 
by “2.2 million” votes even though 
“her votes were very concentrated 
in only a few states.” She spent 
little time in Michigan, never 
visited Wisconsin, and focused 
on Pennsylvania where she still 
lost. She lost those states by a 
collective total of roughly 73,000 
votes. Imagine if the United States 
operated on a popular system, 
also known as a direct democracy. 
Clinton would have secured the 
presidency by concentrating her 
efforts in the East and West Coasts. 
The idea that a popular system 
would be more fair than the 
Electoral College is absurd. Direct 
democracy as an idea is morally 
antithetical to the values of civil 
rights and equality. The French 
Revolution first decided on their 
system of government to be a direct 

democracy, and look at the results: a 
tyrannical and politically invincible 
majority terrorizing and censoring 
the concerns of the minority. With 
direct democracy, the majority 
would have unmatched power to 
silence the minority, hypothetically 
controlling the presidency and 
at least one house of Congress. 
The Electoral College gives the 
minority and disenfranchised the 
opportunity to control how their 
society around them operates 
without fear of being politically 
sidelined. 
This debate will surely continue 
as “a 2018 report on America’s 
future political demography found 
four realistic scenarios in which 
Democrats win the national popular 
vote but lose the Electoral College 
because of the geography of the 
electorate.” With more Democrats 
than 
Republicans 
preferring 
a popular vote rather than the 
Electoral College, 81 percent and 
51 percent, respectively, it would be 
reasonable to assume that if any of 
these scenarios occur, it could lead 
to more fervent calls to drastically 
alter or even outright abolish the 
Electoral College. 
However, 
these 
knee-jerk 
reactions to default to a supposedly 
more “democratic” popular vote 
lack both political and moral 
foresight, possibly opening the 
door for dangerous factions and 
leaders to seize power in America. 
The Electoral College does not 
hinder the democratic process; 
it emboldens it. It serves as a 
reassurance that the politically 
weak and deprived have the 
opportunity to protect their civil 
rights and community. A shock 
to the system — whether that is 
spontaneous 
transformations 
or immediate abolition — would 
entail an inimical and rapid erosion 
to the founding doctrines of the 
United States, sideline political 
minorities and create a far more 
polarized and divisive political 
landscape in the future.

Somewhere on a dingy, pale-
blue sofa in a poorly lit room, 
BROCKHAMPTON 
is 
situated 
before 
your 
screen 
in 
silvery 
jumpsuits. 
Their 
quintessential 
Cheeto-dust 
orange 
garb 
and 
cheesy smiles are supplanted by 
somber, subdued semi-dancemoves 
and emotionally raw lyricism. This 
is their latest album GINGER at 
its overarching emotional core, 
“Dearly Departed.” 
An obvious sly at former vocalist 

Ameer Vann’s departure from the 
band in May 2018, the video depicts 
current 
members 
breaking 
the 
fourth wall as though speaking to 
a particular person. Kevin Abstract 
kicks off this intervention deadpan, 
staring into the eyes of the viewer 
as he spits his verse about betrayal 
and backstabbing, only to leave 
the scene immediately after he’s 
finished. From that point on, the 
music video centers on every 
member in the scene as they bare 
their heartbreak and pain from a 
different point of view. It pans out 
as Joba belts out the high notes in 
the chorus and collapses. It zooms 

in on Matt as he reads his verse 
from notecards only to tear them 
apart and abandon the track that’s 
still playing — Merlyn is in this 
cut but says absolutely nothing, 
sobered. And Dom gets up close and 
personal, punching the camera as 
he describes a situation in which a 
“friend” of his set up another friend 
to get robbed. Conducted in a single 
take, the nuances of the video stand 
out, from the panning in and out of 
the camera to the eye contact of the 
members to the actions they take as 
they sing their verses.
The art of this video pins itself 
in symbolism, every action directed 
towards the camera as though it’s an 
actual person. This emphasizes that 
any beef in the room is not among 
the bandmates but between the 
group and someone else in the room. 
They’re together in the emotional 
battle between BROCKHAMPTON 
and this other person. Ameer 
Vann is never explicitly brought 
up, but given the lyrical content, 
the unity of the members and the 
emotionally 
unhinged 
gestures, 
BROCKHAMPTON makes it clear 
that Vann is no longer welcome and 
has left deep, vulnerable scars in 
their lives.

‘Dearly Departed’: A sobering
group message to Ameer Van

Post Malone released the fourth single, 
“Circles,” from his upcoming album 
Hollywood Bleeding on Aug. 30, following 
in the footsteps of the wildly successful 
“Sunflower” and the regularly successful 
“Wow.” and “Goodbyes.” 
In many respects, “Circles” is the 
same old Post. His vocals are lovelorn, 
shot through with powerful vibrato. The 
chorus is an instant earworm, the type 
upon which Post built and maintained 
his fame. The structure is about as 
straightforward as it gets, and there’s not 
much in the way of experimentation or 
risk in any respect. 
However, Post makes some interesting 
departures from his traditional sound. 
The use of a bright round-string bass 
line (a great one, at that) as opposed to 
his typical electronic 808s is perhaps 
the most notable. The sonic palette as a 

whole seems to be heavily influenced by 
psychedelic pop (e.g. Currents), a sound 
that suits Post surprisingly well. 
“Circles” 
is 
profoundly 
catchy, 
tastefully upbeat and well-arranged. 
The bridge is on the weak side, a little 
too harmonically dependent upon the 
preceding section. Other than that, it’s 
hard to find any real problem with this 
song other than the fact that it plays it 
safe. I continue to be astounded by Post’s 
ability to churn out hit after hit — his 
sense of catchiness in melody is nonpareil 
in pop music today. Hopefully Hollywood 
Bleeding finds him continuing his hot 
streak.

Malone’s ‘Circles’ is
trippy, but plays it safe

One of the first exercises I did in my 16th-century 
counterpoint class this semester was an identification game. 
Our professor took a famous theme from a Mozart piano piece 
and set it in six different styles. After playing each variation, he 
asked us to name the style we thought he was trying to imitate 
or the specific composer.
Going into the exercise, I thought I’d have a lot of trouble 
hearing an imitation of a famous composer from a short eight-
bar variation. I thought we might be able to guess the style 
or period of the music, maybe even the specific sub-period or 
nationality of the music, but never the specific composer.
Yet for five of the six styles, my three-person class was able to 
guess not only the style, but the specific composer our professor 
had sought to emulate. In eight bars of music based on a theme 
by an already famous composer, our professor was able to adapt 
the stylistic nuances and notational idiosyncrasies that define 
specific famous composers. And he was able to so decisively.
This got me thinking about artistic voice and artistic style. Is 
it possible to distinguish an artist’s “voice” from their “style”? 
Given that everyone probably defines these two concepts 
differently, I should clarify that I take “voice” to be an artist’s 
small technical habits that define their artistic output within 
the larger “style” of cultural context, genre and subgenre of art 
that these artists are usually defined with.
The best artists, I believe, are those whose artistic voices are 
immediately recognizable. The composers that we were talking 
about in class, for example, are some of the most prolific 
and ground-breaking composers within the classical music 

tradition that have ever lived. They’ve succeeded in cultivating 
voices that are distinctly their own even as they pushed the 
boundaries of their style.
One artist that I think best embodies this concept of a well-
defined voice is Kurt Vonnegut. I am a huge fan of Vonnegut, 
having first been introduced to him through his relatively 

comedic and light novel “The Sirens of Titan.” When we talk 
about Vonnegut’s style, we think of his background and the 
larger cultural context surrounding his work. The modern 

and postmodern periods, for example, and the World War II 
generation.
But when we talk about Vonnegut’s voice we have very few 
words or larger concepts to compare him to. Though I can’t 
articulate how I know this, I can almost always tell if I am 
reading a play, novel or short story by him. I might use some 
fancy-sounding descriptors to identify specific aspects of this 
voice — nonlinearity in time and plot, randomization surfaces 
with hidden patterns beneath them, dark humour as a means of 
expressing larger concepts — but none of these descriptors in 
sum or part capture everything that makes up his voice. Even 
within his chapters and titles, for example, one can get a clear 
sense of his artistic voice.
Vonnegut’s extremely well-defined artistic voice had a 
positive effect on his career and the perpetual success of his 
estate. A performance of “Happy Birthday, Wanda June”in 
New York City this past year, for example, garnered many more 
positive reviews than one would expect from a rarely performed 
work. Audience members and critics couldn’t help but compare 
the play to other Vonnegut works. For many, myself included, 
it was the transference of this artistic voice onto the stage, and 
not the contents of the play itself, that made the performance 
such an interesting experience.
On the other hand, as was made quite obvious in many of 
the artistic reviews this past month, a strongly-defined artistic 

voice can quickly become a liability for successful artists. Take 
for example Taylor Swift and her recent album, “Lover.”
I should start with a disclaimer that I am far from being 

well-versed in Swift’s music. But in reading some of the reviews 
of her most recent album, however, I couldn’t help but notice 
the complaint that many critics have. Her new album, while 
effectively mimicking her voice, has nothing new to offer. It 
exhibits no new ideas, no new iterations on this voice.
I can think of many other artists that have become weighed 
down by their voices. Many successful artists become 
constrained by their voice, their pathway to success.
It’s not just a unique voice, I’ve come to realize, that marks 
a successful artist. It’s also an ability to bend style to match 
this artistic voice. It’s the ability to not only be informed by the 
cultural context in which the artist creates, it’s the ability to 
bring this context and artistic voice together and allow them to 
influence each other.
The best artists are those whose artistic voices are influential 
enough to bend the stylistic realm that they occupy. And that, 
I realized, is how my class was able to so easily identify the 
composers my professor was imitating. In a world where 
Beethoven’s name is virtually synonymous with early German 
Romanticism, a piece that is distinctly early German Romantic 
is assumedly by Beethoven. And thus, in a paradoxical way, 
artistic voices are perhaps best defined when they lose all 
sense of definition, when they become so embedded in their 
larger cultural context that they can no longer be pointed to as 
a specific artist’s voice at all.

Since 
1969, 
the 
nation’s 
most popular blues and jazz 
musicians have made a stop in 
Ann Arbor to take part in the 
now-historic Ann Arbor Blues 
Festival. B.B. King, Buddy Guy 
and Muddy Waters, among 
others, introduced the Ann 
Arbor population to true blues: 
the blues of Chicago and the 
Mississippi Delta.
As a dedicated blues fanatic 
myself, I was thrilled to be able 
to attend the 2019 Ann Arbor 
Blues 
Festival, 
which 
took 
place Aug. 16 through Aug. 18 at 
the Washtenaw Farm Council 
Fairgrounds.
After finishing up at work, 
I made the short drive to the 
Fairgrounds, going against the 
flow of the congested traffic 
eager to leave Ann Arbor for the 
weekend. With the windows 
down, listening to “Lightnin’ 
Hopkins”and “Otis Rush” live 
in Ann Arbor in 1969, my Camry 
hopped onto a gravel road 
leading into the Fairgrounds.
It does not require a deep 
study of music to understand 
that the blues are not as 
popular as the genre once was. 
The biggest names in present-
day blues are some of the 
smallest names in the grandeur 
of the modern music industry. 
Whether this can be attributed 
to a change in taste or a 
systemic decline of the genre is 
difficult to understand, but the 
fact is the blues, specifically in 
the style of Chicago or Delta 
blues, is a rather niche musical 
interest.
And “niche musical interest” 
is exactly the feeling I got as I 

sat down in the matted grass 
in front of the stage. It was 
clear that outside of those 
brought unwillingly by parents 
and fellow press from other 
nearby university publications, 
I was the youngest member of 
the audience by a significant 
number of years. Somehow, 
I felt out of place, out of 
touch, as I waited for the first 
performance to take the stage.
The 
first 
performance 

was Thornetta Davis, a jazz 
and 
blues 
musician 
from 
Detroit. 
Her 
performance 
and demeanor struck me. She 
was certainly talented, but 
there was something else in 
her that injected some serum 
of liveliness and happiness 
into the veins of the seasoned 
audience. 
As 
Davis 
sang, 
audience members got up from 
their lawn chairs and shuffled 
to the stage to dance along with 
her. My jaw dropped as I saw 

80-year-old 
people 
dancing 
and singing along to the music. 
The music was loud, and this 
elderly audience was loving 
it, and I began to love it too. I 
was out of my usual place, out 
of touch with my usual life, but 
creating that environment in a 
positive and invigorating way 
is precisely where this festival 
triumphs. I was out of my 
comfort zone in a way that was 
beneficial to me.
Another performance that 
piqued my interest was that 
of Bernard Allison. As he took 
the stage, a mass of bodies 
again waded to the edge of the 
stage to sway along with his 
guitar. I learned that Allison’s 
father was a performer at the 
Ann Arbor Blues Festival in 
its early years, and Bernard 
had attended at the young 
age of seven. He continued to 
play the blues since, and upon 
returning to Ann Arbor to show 
what he had learned, Allison 
was greeted by a warm and 
welcoming Ann Arbor audience 
that indeed remembered him 
and his father.
Despite 
the 
widespread 
falling-off of the genre over the 
years, I was delighted to see 
that the blues were alive and 
well in Ann Arbor, kept afloat 
by the love of its audience. 
When one of the hosts asked 
how many original audience 
members from the 1969 festival 
were present today, I was 
shocked to see so many hands 
rise. Perhaps these lovers of the 
blues are what keep the genre 
alive. The blues artists and 
their audience trade a musical 
love that keeps the heart of the 
blues beating and the lungs of 
the blues breathing.

Ann Arbor Blues Festival
continues to invigorate

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

THE ALLMAN BETTS BAND

The concept of a “suburb” 
has always been a pop culture 
staple — from the cult classic 
“Heathers” 
to 
2016’s 
“Bad 
Moms,” 
these 
enclaves 
of 
society are a thing of intrigue. 
Rational 
conversations 
and 
enriching activities are thrown 
out the window only to be 
replaced by raging mothers and 
parent-teacher 
conferences 
over a child’s mild cough. Based 
on the book of the same name, 
“Where’d You Go Bernadette?” 
follows Bernadette Fox (Cate 
Blanchett, “Ocean’s 8”) as she, 
and her life, seem to unravel 
underneath 
the 
artificial 
pressure of suburbia. 
As a movie, “Where’d You 
Go Bernadette?” is perfectly 
average. As a book-to-movie 
adaptation, however, it leaves 
much to be desired. Especially 
given the fact that much of 
the important plot points and 
character development occurs 
between the lines of emails 
and messages sent between 
characters. The kind of nuance 
that sets apart “Where’d You 
Go Bernadette?” as a book 
doesn’t lend itself to an easy 
transition to the big screen. 
Bernadette 
herself 
is 
a 
well-developed character — 
her long-winded monologues 
to 
Manjula 
(her 
online 
“assistant”) 
capture 
the 
manic energy of Bernadette 
in the book. Sadly, she is the 
only character that receives 
this kind of treatment. Her 
daughter, Bee (Emma Nelson, 
“Margaret and the Moon”), 
is left to occupy the movie 
solely 
as 
the 
stereotypical 

“nerd” at her school, with 
little exploration into how her 
childhood heart issues might 
have affected her or even 
the lengths to which her life 
was affected by her mother’s 
disappearance. 
What 
little 
emotion that came from Bee 
was the result of Nelson’s 
acting — no credit can be given 
to 
the 
less-than-impressive 
screenplay. 
The “Galer Street Gnats,” 
as Bernadette so lovingly calls 
the other mothers at Bee’s 
school, fail to incite the kind of 

strong hatred these characters 
should garner in any situation, 
fictional or otherwise. Audrey 
(Kristen Wiig, “Bridesmaids”) 
and 
Soo-Lin 
(Zoe 
Chao, 
“God Particles”) are pivotal 
characters in the book, with 
each woman going through 
some intense changes in their 
relationship and their personal 
lives. Yet we see none of that in 
the movie. On top of that, their 
relationship with Bernadette 
changes 
dramatically 
as 
well. There seemed to be an 

attempt at showcasing this 
change between Bernadette 
and Audrey. However, without 
many of the details from the 
book, it seems far-fetched that 
in a moment of vulnerability 
Bernadette would go to one of 
her sworn enemies for help. 
If we recognize that there 
is a difference between the 
kinds of details included in a 
movie compared to those in a 
book, this abrupt change could 
potentially be warranted, but 
that would be a hard argument 
to make. 
Within every average movie, 
though, there are always a 
few good moments. Take Cate 
Blanchett, for example. Fox is 
a force to be reckoned with and 
Blanchett was the best person 
to do it. Her rough bangs and 
sharp features come together to 
create the kind of intimidating 
woman who really doesn’t 
belong in a Seattle suburb. 
Add to that a slight edge to her 
American accent (Blanchett is 
Australian, after all), and the 
effect is complete. 
“Where’d 
You 
Go 
Bernadette?” is not a bad 
movie, per se. It simply serves 
as a reminder that not all 
books need to be turned into 
movies. Maybe this let-down 
is my own fault because I 
prefer to read the book before 
I see the movie or because I 
continue to see adaptations no 
matter how many times I am 
disappointed. All I really know 
is, despite how fun it might be 
to think about what my favorite 
characters would look like on 
the silver screen, some of their 
stories are better suited to the 
detail-oriented environment of 
a book.

FILM REVIEW

ANNAPURNA PICTURES

I had not done any research 
about Showtime’s “On Becoming 
a God in Central Florida” before 
sitting down to watch it, and 
perhaps for that reason, I spent 
the first half of the pilot trying 
to figure out what exactly was 
bothering me about it all. We 
follow Travis Stubbs (Alexander 
Skarsgard, “The Little Drummer 
Girl”), a typical Orlando area 
middle 
class 
working 
man 
whose life is consumed by the 
insidious, omnipresent multi-level 
marketing company FAM. In a 
thoroughly engaging, bizarre and 
surprisingly dark (yet charming) 
pilot, the show sets up a world 
in which rhetoric straight from 
the playbook of capitalism-on-
steroids consumes and leads a 
man to his end. But what really 
bothered me for the first half or 
so was the fact that I couldn’t 
pin down why I recognized who 
was 
playing 
Travis, 
because 
Alexander Skarsgard was wearing 
a beautiful, glorious mullet.
But the real star of the show is 
one if its own executive producers, 
Kirsten Dunst (“Fargo”). She 
plays Travis’s wife, Krystal, a 

firm yet supportive woman who 
works a minimum wage job at 
the local water park. Travis’s 
relentless ambition and desire to 
become a millionaire leads him 
to sacrifice nearly every waking 
moment of his life to recruiting 
for the FAM pyramid scheme, 
leading to a simmering and rising 
tension between him and Krystal, 
as well as an unexpected, absurd 
demise.
Travis 
is 
ultimately 
an 
endearing yet sad, pathetic fool. 
Unlike the usual roles he gets, 
Skarsgard plays one which is 
dumpy and weak rather than 
charismatic and godlike. His 
full devotion to FAM takes on 
the character of a cult member 
or a religious zealot, leading 
him to eventually quite his full 
time J-O-B (FAM doesn’t permit 
saying the cursed word out loud) 
and submit fully to the company’s 
cause. 
However 
creepy 
and 
dystopian FAM seems, it’s an 
even creepier reality out there, 
considering that about 100 miles 
west of Ann Arbor lies the town 
of Ada, headquarters of Amway, 
one of the biggest multilevel 
marketers 
out 
there 
(created 
by a DeVos, perhaps a familiar 
name). Many struggling working 

people are seduced in the same 
way Travis Stubbs is, and while 
Stubbs’s persona is hilarious, it 
doesn’t completely mask how 
pitiable it is. 
Meanwhile 
Dunst, 
who 
is 
poised to be the main protagonist 
after 
the 
pilot, 
is 
equally 
stunning. Dunst season is indeed 
in full swing, and her range is as 
well in the pilot. Equipped with a 
charming Floridian accent, braces 
and rather delightful outfits, she 
is nearly the polar opposite of her 
husband: steely, firm and a long-

term thinker and planner. While 
she is supportive of her husband 
and even tries to help him in his 
FAM ventures at one point, she 
is rightfully exasperated by his 
sheer stupidity and the danger it 
poses to their young family.
“On Becoming a God in 
Central Florida”’s pilot is a 
promising 
springboard 
into 
future explorations of capitalism 
and the rehabilitating effects of 
MLM companies. Oh, and maybe 
Kirsten Dunst’s performance of a 
lifetime.

Skarsgard and his mullet shine in
‘On Becoming a God in Central Fla.’

How Eubanks unlocks the offense

A spread offense, as with any 
other, is usually defined by its 
personnel. Philosophically, the 
idea of forcing opponents to 
defend all 53.5 yards of horizontal 
space on a football field translates 
to getting athletic guys to run 
routes 
and 
spreading 
them 
out. Usually, that means wide 
receivers.
The proliferation of the spread 
means that the three receiver, 
or 11 personnel (one back, one 
tight end) looks have fast become 
the norm. In the NFL last year, 
teams used it 64 percent of the 
time, per Football Outsiders’ 
Almanac. More traditional looks 
with two backs (21 personnel) 
or two tight ends (12 personnel) 
— the kind Michigan fans have 
become accustomed to under Jim 
Harbaugh — were used 7.3 and 16 
percent of the time, respectively.
More relevant, the last three 
offenses with Josh Gattis on staff 
have used 11 personnel 96, 94 
and 61 percent of the time, per 
Pro Football Focus. Hiring him 
with the promise of a pro-spread 
offense seemed to imply that the 
35 percent of the time Michigan 
spent in 11 last year would rocket 
upwards.
This did not account for Nick 
Eubanks.
Eubanks, a senior tight end, 
came to Michigan at 236 pounds. 
He checked in this year at 6-foot-
5, 256 pounds, or in other words, 
the same height and four pounds 
smaller than Travis Kelce of the 
NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs. 
Athletically 
speaking, 
that 
means Eubanks can line up next 
to a tackle and block. It means he 
can split out wide and run a route. 
It means he’s probably bigger than 
most defensive backs and faster 
than most linebackers, which in 
turn means that when defensive 
coordinators prepare for the 
Wolverines, they need to spend 
time figuring out how to deal with 
Nick Eubanks.
Football is a never-ending game 
of chess where if you can force an 
opponent to react to what you’re 
doing, you’re probably winning. 
Eubanks can force a reaction.

“I think it really clicked at 
the end of the summer and then 
training camp it started to show 
up,” tight ends coach Sherrone 
Moore said. “Cause he was 
starting to make play after play 
after play, but that was not only in 
the passing game, it was in the run 
game.”
Even without a high volume 
— just 10 catches in three years — 
Eubanks’ ability had always been 
obvious. In those 10 catches, he 
went for 218 yards. This summer, 
he met with Moore as much as 
possible and put in extra work 
in the run game. Last Saturday 
in Michigan’s opener, the fruits 
of that labor started to become 
apparent.
The Wolverines, new offense 
and all, spent more time in 12 
personnel, with Eubanks and 
Sean McKeon at tight end, than 
in 11. On an early second quarter 
drive where two RPOs and a post 
route to Nico Collins resulted 
in a touchdown that seemed to 
personify Gattis’ speed in space 
philosophy, they were in 12 
personnel the whole time.
In 
an 
offense 
where 
the 
purpose of everything is to create 
conflict for the defense, Eubanks 
just raises more questions for 
opposing coordinators to try and 
solve.
On that Collins post route, 
Eubanks is lined up as the H 
receiver, a threat to either run 
block or run a route — conflict 
exacerbated by Michigan having 
run RPOs on the two previous 

plays. Eubanks runs a wheel route, 
taking two defenders including 
a safety with him and helping 
create a 1-on-1 for Collins.
Later in the game, this time 
as the lone tight end on the 
field, Eubanks lined up as the H 
receiver again on second-and-2. 
At any prior point in his career, 
that would have been a smoke 
signal telling the defense it’s 
going to be a pass. Instead, the 
Wolverines ran a split-zone read 
with Patterson keeping the ball 
as Eubanks arced around the 
formation as a lead blocker.
McKeon said Monday that part 
of the reason Michigan used so 
much 12 personnel was specific 
to the matchup against Middle 
Tennessee. “But I think Nick as 
the H tight end, he’s so versatile, 
he can line up as a receiver or come 
in and block,” McKeon said. “So 
really got to defend everything 
out of that personnel with us.”
The Wolverines aren’t about to 
take it out of their rotation, and 
the percentages are unlikely to 
dictate a more traditional spread. 
As long as they have Eubanks, 
they don’t need to.
“We can get in any formation 
we have in the offense in that 
personnel and do whatever we 
want,” Moore said. “We can use 
him as a fullback, we can use Sean 
as a fullback. We can use them 
both split out wide, as receivers. 
We can use them on the line. 
“So it’s just going to create 
problems for defenses.”

‘NASCAR’ package gives versatility

All 
offseason, 
the 
hype 
surrounding 
Michigan 
has 
been a product of its offensive 
promise. The phrase at the core 
of that hype, of course, has been 
Josh Gattis’ mantra of “speed in 
space.”
Saturday night against Middle 
Tennessee State, Don Brown 
made sure his defense didn’t get 
left behind, adding speed with 
regular NASCAR packages — 
looks with four defensive ends.
A year ago, the Wolverines 
never needed the look to generate 
pressure. Chase Winovich and 
Rashan Gary, with the occasional 
third-down 
appearance 
from 
Josh Uche, filled that task with 
ease.
But with Winovich and Gary 
gone, Michigan’s strength at 
defensive end lies in its depth. 
Sophomore Aidan Hutchinson 
and junior Kwity Paye are the 
starters, but Uche — typically 
a linebacker — can slot in as 
an edge rusher. Behind them, 
senior Michael Danna, a transfer 
from Central Michigan, brings 
a skillset that produced the 
nation’s second-highest success 
rate on pass rushes in 2018, 
according to Pro Football Focus.
So when Brown looked at the 
personnel in front of him, his 
solution became clear.

“When you realize you got 
guys you can run and you want 
all of them on the field, that’s 
when we’re like, ‘We got to 
get them on the field,’ ” said 
defensive line coach Shaun Nua. 
“So coach Brown does a great job 
of making sure that we identify 
good players, their strengths and 
design packages to get them on.”
Saturday, 
the 
look’s 
first 
appearance brought a mix of 
confusion and intrigue — the 
sight of Uche and Hutchinson’s 
speed on the interior makes 
that inevitable. On the MTSU 
offensive 
line, 
confusion 
prevailed, with a pulling guard 
leaving a gaping hole for fifth-
year senior linebacker Jordan 
Glasgow to blast through.
After one NASCAR package, 
MTSU’s statline against it: one 
sack, negative-eight yards.
The next time the Wolverines 
ran it, they nearly added a safety 
to the tally, as a potential hold 
on Uche in the end zone went 
uncalled. Midway through the 
third quarter — the package’s 
fifth usage — it forced MTSU 
quarterback Asher O’Hara into 
a lame-duck pass that senior 
cornerback Lavert Hill dropped 
with 20 yards of open field 
between him and the end zone.
Despite 
the 
miscues, 
Michigan’s final statline on its 
NASCAR packages that weren’t 
nullified by penalties: seven 

plays, one sack, 3-for-6 passing, 
10 yards.
“It just adds pressure to the 
quarterback and something for 
the other team to think about,” 
Glasgow said. “And when you 
think about it, we have a lot of 
other people that could fill the 
roles of everyone in that package, 
or anyone on the field at that 
time.”
For now, the package is largely 
constrained 
to 
3rd-and-long 
situations because of the speed 
the defensive ends provide, but 
when asked about the possibility 
of using it on other downs and 
distances, Nua said: “Coach 
Brown likes to call it whenever, 
we just got to be ready.”
The one time Michigan used 
it in another situation Saturday 
— 2nd-and-9 at midfield — Uche 
and Paye jumped offside, all 
the defensive ends stopped and 
MTSU picked up an easy first 
down. Those are the unavoidable 
miscues that will take more than 
a week to iron out.
But the tape is resoundingly 
positive. And this week, the 
assessment 
at 
Schembechler 
Hall has followed suit.
“It’s great cause it’s a lot of 
quickness and speed on that 
front so we can attack every 
position on the offensive line,” 
Danna said. “And we got a whole 
lot more of that coming this 
season, so I’m excited.”

Robinson, Pertofsky prove versatile enough to support new system

In Friday morning’s season 
opener, the Michigan volleyball 
team’s two class of 2019 early 
signees flashed more than just 
potential.
In their debuts, freshmen Jess 
Robinson and May Pertofsky 
were 
the 
driving 
offensive 
forces 
in 
the 
15th-ranked 
Wolverines’ sweep of Oakland. 
The duo maintained the two 
highest attack efficiencies on 
the team, even while leading 
the offense in total volume. 
Pertofsky 
and 
Robinson 
finished 
with 
nine 
and 
eight 
kills, 
respectively, 
on 
just 
22 
combined 
swings.
While 
most 
freshmen 
are 
prone 
to 
mistakes, 
the 
two committed 
just 
three 
hitting errors in total — good for 
a collective hitting percentage 
of .636. For reference, roughly 
.250 is considered the average 
for a pin hitter. It’s only August, 
and the program’s two blue chip 
recruits are already posting 
encouraging numbers.
Take one play in the second 
set, for example. With Michigan 
up 17-10, Robinson’s eyes lit 
up as an errant Golden Grizzly 
forearm pass began a trajectory 
across the net. She took a half-
step backward, loaded up and 
leapt almost immediately. She 
seemingly levitated and, soon 
after, celebrated after burying 
the overpass with ease.
“When she jumped, we all 
thought she jumped early,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“But she kept going up and the 
next thing we knew, she was 
perfectly on time. With things 
like that, you don’t know them 
real well yet so you see those 
things and they’re exciting.

“… There’s still tons to learn 
for them. They’re good learners 
and they’re super competitive, 
and I think they did a really nice 
job coming out of the gates.”
Expectations for Robinson 
— the nation’s No. 8 recruit, 
according to Prep Volleyball — 
were particularly high over the 
summer. After finding herself 
in the middle of a four-horse 
race for two middle blocker 
jobs, 
the 
6-foot-2 
in-state 
product’s 
debut 
will 
only 
keep the hype train rolling. 
Pertofsky, 
meanwhile, 
hails 
from Los Angeles, where she 
racked up three All-League 
Gold Coast MVP 
awards 
during 
her high school 
career.
Though 
both 
of 
them 
are 
natural 
outside 
hitters, 
they’ve 
been seeing the 
most court time 
at opposite and 
middle blocker in 
what Rosen calls 
his “three middle offense.”
With 
four 
legitimate 
candidates for just two starting 
middle blocker spots, Rosen got 
creative. In order to preserve 
the 6-2 system — a volleyball 
notation that translates to six 
eligible hitters and two setters 
— the Wolverines are able to 
keep Pertofsky and Robinson 
at the right side pin. Fifth-year 
senior middle blocker Cori 
Crocker and sophomore middle 
blocker Kayla Bair both perform 
best with attackers on each side 
of them, and Rosen is able to 
sandwich them between two 
other eligible hitters by keeping 
his two prized freshmen at 
the right pin. Bair opened the 
season sidelined with an injury, 
but it’ll be a sustainable system 
even when she returns.
It’s the best way to keep 
each weapon involved without 
sacrificing one of senior setter 
MacKenzi 
Welsh’s 
options, 
but the option wouldn’t even 

be on the table if Robinson and 
Pertofsky 
weren’t 
versatile 
enough to handle it. Thanks 
to their experience as outside 
hitters, adjusting to the new 
system didn’t take long for the 
newcomers.
“It allows us to put (Bair and 
Crocker) in a position where 

they can play straight up middle 
and never have to worry about 
being in a 5-1, but you have to 
have versatile players to do it,” 
Rosen said. “When Jess and May 
came in, we could see they can 
hit second tempo balls, they can 
block on the right, they can hit in 
transition and they can hit out of 

system. So we started cooking up 
this system because it allows us 
to hide some of our weaknesses 
while maximizing our strengths.”
Friday morning wasn’t a sign 
of what Robinson and Pertofsky 
can do in this system down the 
road, it was a sign of how they can 
help take the Wolverines back to 

the Sweet 16 — if not deeper into 
the NCAA Tournament — sooner 
rather than later.
“We’re 
excited 
about 
(the 
system),” Rosen said. “It gives us 
the best chance to be competitive 
at a high level. We’ve still got 
a lot of work to do, but they’ll 
get there.”
