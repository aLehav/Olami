ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

WARREN — On the eve of 

Election Day, Donald Trump Jr. 
said Michigan residents could 
change the deceptive nature of 
politics by voting for his father, 
Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump, for president of 
the United States in a stop in the 
state.

More than 100 supporters 

attended the event, which was 
held at the Ukrainian Cultural 
Center 
in 
Warren, 
Mich., 

including Republican candidates 
for state senator and Rob Steele, 
Michigan Republican National 
Committeeman, who introduced 
Trump Jr. at the event.

In his remarks, Trump Jr. aimed 

to appeal to the predominantly 
Eastern European crowd by 
citing his Czechoslovakian roots. 
He also focused on weaknesses 
he saw in the Barack Obama 
administration, 
and 
saying 

an “outsider” like his father is 
the right person to solve them. 
Before introducing Trump Jr. to 

the crowd, Steele emphasized 
the same sentiment on the 
effectiveness of outsiders.

“Donald Trump is a do-er, and 

there is nothing a politician can’t 
stand more than a do-er,” Trump 

Jr. said. “(Politicians are) talkers. 
They do nothing, they’re only 
professional at getting elected.”

Trump Jr.’s visit was among 

many rallies taking place in 
Michigan in the lead in to the 

election, which has grown in 
potential 
significance 
in 
the 

election rapidly in the past few 
months. Democratic presidential 

In March, Michigan was part of a 

so-called political revolution.

Defying almost every poll, the 

state went for Sen. Bernie Sanders 
(I–Vt.) in the Democratic primary, 
an unexpected upset of the eventual 
Democratic presidential nominee, 
Hillary Clinton. Sanders’s win was 
driven in part by young people — 
including University of Michigan 
students — who turned out in large 
numbers with a clear preference 
that wasn’t Clinton.

In the general election, however, 

Michigan has been blue for a long 
time, since 1988. It wasn’t really 
supposed 
to 
matter 
whether

Michigan, or other students and

During 
President 
Barack 

Obama’s visit to the University of 
Michigan Monday — one day before 
Election Day — the president aimed 
to use his legacy to sway students 
and other state residents to turn 
out for Democratic presidential 
nominee Hillary Clinton.

Clinton 
currently 
holds 
a 

five-point lead over Republican 
presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump in Michigan, whom Obama 
said has an “unfit” temperament for 
office.

An estimated 9,000 people, 

including 
many 
Michigan 

politicians, attended the event at 
the Ray L. Fisher Stadium. Students 
and local residents began lining up 
in the early hours of the morning to 
secure a seat to see the president.

For LSA senior Andrew Davis, 

seeing the president was a once in a 
lifetime experience.

“It was absolutely worth it,” 

Davis said. “We got here at, like, 7 

a.m., stood in line. It was one of the 
greatest experiences of my life.”

Audience 
members 
erupted 

into cheers as Obama took the 
stage. After addressing the crowd 
with an enthusiastic “Go Blue,” he 
echoed the sentiments of Chelsea 
Clinton, who introduced him, 
emphasizing the importance of 
voting and describing the election 
as one that hinges on moral values. 
The reputation of the United States 
in the eyes of the world, he told the 
crowd, rests on this election.

For the majority of his speech, 

Obama 
highlighted 
what 
he 

described as his progressive legacy 
— one he said he hopes will be 
continued with a Clinton victory on 
Tuesday.

“But tomorrow, tomorrow you 

will choose whether we continue 
this journey of progress, or whether 
it all goes out the window,” Obama 
said. “Tomorrow, you get to choose 
between politics of blame and 
divisiveness and resentment — or 
you can choose a politics that says 
we’re all stronger together.”

Focusing on Michigan, Obama 

also reminded the audience of his 
work as president following the 
2008 recession, including his work 
to revive the state’s auto industry 
and lower the unemployment rate 
in the state. He also highlighted 
his commitment to fighting climate 
change and his administration’s 
role in killing Osama Bin Laden.

Clinton, he told the crowd, has 

specific plans to continue moving 
the country forward on issues like 
those.

“She’s 
got 
plans 
to 
grow 

manufacturing, plans to boost 
people’s wages, plans to help 
students with their college debt,” 
Obama said. “Specific plans — not 
vague plans, not imaginary plans. 
She knows how to do it. And that’s 
why she needs to be the next 
president of the United States — as 
long as you vote.”

LSA sophomore Martin Hubbard 

said 
Obama’s 
résumé 
helped 

convince him as a voter that Clinton 
is the right choice for president.

“Obama 
endorsing 
Clinton 

influenced my decision to vote

President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

decision to come to the University 
of Michigan only a day before 
the election, coupled with other 
recent Democratic and GOP visit, 
suggests that Michigan’s role in 
this presidential election may be a 
bit different than usual. 

For the past six elections, 

Michigan 
has 
maintained 
a 

consistent 
Democrat 
majority. 

However, this year, there have been 
suggestions from the beginning 
of the campaign season of the 
potential for a shift in the state 
toward the Republican party. 
Polls tightened even as Tuesday 
approaches,

Ann Arbor City Council 

Member Sabra Briere officially 

announced today her last day 

in office will be Dec. 5 via an 

online letter.

Briere has served as Ward 

1 Representative since 2007, 

making her the longest seated 

member of Council.

 An Ann Arbor resident 

since 1973, Briere wrote that 

her decision to resign was made 

due to “happy circumstances,” 

and has nothing to do with 

negative feelings about her 

position or Ann Arbor. Rather, 

she wrote that it is because she 

will be moving to Santa Rosa, 

California, with her husband to 

be closer to her son.

 “This is a bittersweet 

decision,” Briere wrote. “It has 

been, and remains, one of my 

greatest pleasures and honors to 

serve you and our community.”

 In her tenure as a local 

politician over the past several 

decades, along with serving as 

a councilmember Briere was 

also the Ann Arbor Democratic 

Party Chair in the early 1990’s 

and ran for mayor of Ann Arbor 

in 2014, finishing second in the 

Democratic primary.

During her time on Council, 

Briere has focused on a range 

of issues, from development to 

civic participation.

 Briere has campaigned 

as a candidate of the citizens, 

focusing much of her race 

for mayor on community 

conversation.

“One of the first issues 

I brought to Council was to 

advocate for increasing citizen 

participation – in zoning, in 

development, in the budget 

process, in safety – and I 

believe that focus on citizen 

participation will continue,” 

Briere said in her letter.

 Briere has also advocated 

for varied and affordable 

housing, increased pedestrian 

and cyclist safety and access. 

She wrote that she still hopes 

the City will build more 

sidewalks and bike paths.

Under the city’s charter, 

the Council must vote on a 

replacement to fill Briere’s 

seat. Over the next month, 

the Council will be accepting 

applications for a new 

representative, according to 

Briere’s letter. The interviews 

will be held on November 

28, with citizens able to 

communicate to the Council 

and make recommendations 

throughout the following week. 

Briere said she would like the 

seat filled as quickly as possible 

so the Council can get back 

to regular business with full 

participation.

 In her letter, she urged the 

city to work toward its best 

possible future with full citizen 

engagement, writing that she 

trusts residents will help this 

process.

“I found a home in Ann 

Arbor,” Briere wrote. “And 

more especially, I have really 

enjoyed having you as my 

neighbors. I’ve benefitted 

from living in a community 

with curious, engaged people 

who have an enthusiastic 

commitment to seeing Ann 

Arbor become the best 

community possible – even as 

we haven’t always agreed on 

what that means.”

Clinton stops at Grand Valley State
in final appeal for student vote 

Event one of many for Democratic presidential nominee on election eve

GRAND RAPIDS — In one 

of her final campaign stops of 
the election season, Democratic 
presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton spoke to a crowd of 4,000 
at Grand Valley State University 
about her vision for the country in 
an attempt to galvanize voters one 
day before the election.

Michigan’s 
position 
as 
a 

potential swing state has been 
highlighted 
by 
on 
influx 
of 

campaign 
events 
from 
both 

parties just prior to Election Day. 
President Barack Obama visited 
Ann Arbor Monday morning to 
campaign for Clinton, and later 
that night, Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump and his 
vice presidential nominee Gov. 
Mike Pence (R–Ind.) also rallied in 
Grand Rapids. Surrogates for both 
have also visited throughout the 

week.

For the majority of this election 

cycle, Clinton has led Trump in 
the Michigan polls, with the most 
recent RealClearPolitics polling 
average putting Clinton 3 points 
ahead of Trump. However, in the 
Michigan primary election in 
March, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) 
upset Clinton to win the state after 
polls showed her with a 21.4-point 
lead prior to the election. Clinton’s 
lead has also narrowed in the past 
weeks.

In 
Allendale, 
Clinton 

encouraged the audience to go 
vote the following day, asking them 
what example they wished to set 
for future generations.

“When your kids and your 

grandkids ask what you did in 2016, 
when everything was on the line, I 
hope you will be able to say that you 
voted for a better, stronger, fairer 
America,” she said. “An America 
where we build bridges — not 
walls, and an America where we 

prove that, yes, love trumps hate.”

At the event, Clinton touted 

her higher education reform plan, 
marked by a goal for tuition-free 
college for families who earn less 
than $125,000 per year. Following 
a primary season in which Sanders 
received a significant amount of 
support from college students 
for his tuition-free college plan, 
Clinton and Sanders collaborated 
on the renewed reform plan.

“I am proud of the campaign 

that Bernie Sanders and I ran,” she 
said. “We wanted to figure out how 
to produce on some of the goals we 
both shared.”

Clinton also spent much of her 

speech highlighting the differences 
between her and her opponent 
and 
criticizing 
the 
economic 

plans Trump has laid out. She 
emphasized the middle class, small 
businesses and renewable energy 
in her economic plan.

“We’ve got to have an economy 

for everybody, not just those at the 
top,” she said. “If you believe as I 
do that America thrives when the 
middle class thrives, then you have 
to vote tomorrow.”

In introducing Clinton, Sen. 

Debbie Stabenow (D–Mich.) also 
criticized Trump on the economy, 
noting he has contracted work 
overseas and saying his primary 
interest is his personal profit.

“Donald Trump has lived his 

whole life for himself,” she said. 
“This guy has zero credibility on 
jobs … the only change Donald 
Trump cares about is the change in 
his own pocket.”

Clinton also stressed that she is 

a proponent of equal pay and paid 
family leave, two issues that have 
been cornerstones of her campaign. 
Ivanka Trump, Trump’s daughter, 
has also highlighted these issues 
while campaigning on his behalf.

Clinton 
said 
the 
contrasts 

between her and Trump are clear, 
noting he has accused her of taking 
political advantage of her gender.

for her,” he said. “Him being the 
president of the United States, he 
has a lot of say, experience and 
credibility. He’s been the president 
of this country for eight years and 
there is no one else more qualified 
to say who he thinks should be 
president.”

Obama 
also 
took 
aim 
at 

Republican 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump directly, listing reasons 
Trump is unfit to be president.

“Donald 
Trump 
is 

temperamentally 
unfit 
to 
be 

commander-in-chief,” Obama said. 
“Over the weekend, his campaign 
took away his Twitter account. If 
your closest advisers don’t trust 
you to tweet, then how can we trust 
him with the nuclear codes?”

Several 
politicians 
and 

candidates 
also 
spoke 
during 

the event on the importance of 
the youth vote, including Larry 
Deitch (D) and Denise Ilitch (D), 
candidates for the University’s 
Board of Regents, as well as Reps. 
Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.), Brenda 
Lawrence (D–Mich.), Sandy Levin 
(D–Mich.) and Sen. Gary Peters 
(D–Mich.).

Before Obama spoke, Chelsea 

Clinton told the crowd this election 
was not just a choice of politics but 
a choice between two different sets 
of values.

“There is a world of a difference 

between what my mother stands 
for and what her opponent does,” 
Clinton said. “We have a chance 
to prove that ‘stronger together’ is 
who we are. It is what my mother 
has defined her life by.”

During the last half of his 

speech, 
Obama 
echoed 
that 

sentiment, asking the audience to 
imagine what a Trump presidency 
would look like given his actions on 
the campaign trail — particularly 
toward women and minorities.

“Donald Trump is uniquely 

unqualified to hold this job,” 
Obama said. “But the good news, 
Michigan, is you are uniquely 
qualified to make sure he does not 
get the job. And the good news is, 
you don’t just have to vote against 
something — you actually have a 
candidate who’s worthy of your 
vote.”

Obama’s visit was one of 

multiple campaign stops from 
both Clinton and Trump in the 
state over the past few days, a 
potential sign that Michigan will 
be more competitive this year than 
in years past. In addition to the 
president, Clinton herself will visit 
Grand Rapids tonight and former 
President Bill Clinton campaigned 
in Lansing Sunday night. Trump 
visited Sterling Heights Sunday 
and Republican vice presidential 
nominee 
Mike 
Pence 
visited 

Lansing on Friday. A Republican 
has not won the state since 1988.

In his remarks, Obama noted the 

expectation that Michigan would 

be close in the election, repeating 
his call to vote.

“But, Michigan, all that progress 

goes down the drain if we don’t win 
tomorrow,” Obama said. “This race 
will be close here in Michigan, just 
like it will be in a lot of parts of the 
country.”

LSA senior Lauren Gallagher, 

president of Students for Hillary, 
wrote in an email interview that 
she thinks Obama’s visit signifies 
the importance of the youth vote. 
He is one of several campaign 
surrogates to talk on campus in the 
past few months, including Sen. 
Tim Kaine (D-VA), the Democratic 
vice presidential nominee, and Sen. 
Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“We’ve seen in past elections 

how powerful the student voice can 
be,” Gallagher wrote. “Big name 
surrogate visits to our campus is 
the campaign sending a message 
that our voices matter, that the 
decision about what direction this 
country is headed in is up to us. It’s 
my hope that students don’t take 
this lightly and turn out tomorrow, 
it’s our futures that are on the line 
right now.”

LSA junior Casey Martel said 

attending the rally was a memory 
she will never forget.

“The rally was great,” she said. 

“It reminded me of why I am voting 
for Clinton. It was definitely a once 
in a lifetime experience to hear a 
sitting president speak — and the 
day before an election.”

nominee Hillary Clinton currently 
leads Trump by about 3 points 
according 
to 
RealClearPolitics. 

Also on Monday, Trump and 
Hillary Clinton visited Grand 
Rapids, while Clinton’s daughter, 
Chelsea, accompanied President 
Barack Obama to the University of 
Michigan.

At the Warren event, Trump 

Jr. contrasted Clinton with his 
father, 
saying 
that 
Trump’s 

career doesn’t rely on political 
involvement, making his motives 
to run altruistic. Trump Jr. also 
charged that Clinton didn’t have 
the qualifications necessary for 
presidency.

“They’re worth $250 million, but 

what have they created?” he asked. 
“What business? I’m not aware 
of any. Who have they hired? I’m 
not aware of anyone other than a 
couple lobbyists and people who 
have scrubbed servers.”

He 
also 
said 
not 
enough 

attention is being placed on 

America’s problems — rather, he 
said too much focus is instead on 
political correctness and aid that 
goes toward foreign countries.

“I watch reporters talking about 

how we should be more concerned 
about the feelings of people from 
countries that hate us,” he said. 
“People from countries that can’t 
stand our freedoms. People that 
hate every aspect of us.”

Trump Jr. also touched on 

what he characterized as failures 
of the Obama administration, 
with a particular emphasis on the 
Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile 
Obama drew an estimated crowd of 
9,000 to the University of Michigan 
on Monday, where he emphasized 
the success of his legacy and the 
importance of its continuation.

“Affordable health care sounds 

great on paper,” Trump Jr. said. 
“When you get your headline or 
your tweet of 140 characters or less 
that’s fine. But really we have this 
20,000-page document that no one 
has really read.”

Given that Trump is better 

known as a businessman than 

a politician, Ed Holowchak, a 
resident of St. Clair Shores, Mich., 
said he found Trump’s decision to 
run for presidency to be selfless.

“He’s 
an 
outsider, 
not 
a 

politician,” Holowchak said. “He 
doesn’t have to do this. He’s doing 
this just because he loves his 
country. When have we ever had 
that before?”

Royal Oak resident Mary Tzianis 

cited the repeal of the ACA as her 
main incentive to vote for Trump.

“I have a young son with autism, 

so his care is very expensive for our 
family,” Tzianis said. “If Hillary 
gets into office, it’s going to put us 
in a near-homeless state because 
we won’t be able to afford our son’s 
care.”

For many who attended the 

event, the policies at hand were 
more important than the perceived 
character traits of the candidates.

“They try to attack Trump’s 

character, but they can never 
attack what his plans are. They’re 
just going by these tiny character 
things, but the man has got a plan,” 
Tzianis said.

millennials in the state, didn’t ever 
entirely transfer their enthusiasm 
to Clinton — until recently.

“Many of the students originally 

were Sanders supporters, and 
I do think that you’ve got some 
students that Clinton was not their 
first choice,” said Aaron Kall, an 
expert on election politics and the 
University’s director of debate. 
“They’re probably closer to Clinton 
than 
(Republican 
presidential 

nominee Donald) Trump but there 
were a lot of hard feelings during 
the primary and they’re kind of on 

the fence on whether to turn 
out.”

But as the race in Michigan 

has begun to tighten, with Clinton 
only five points ahead, Democrats 
have begun ramping up their 
presence in places like Ann Arbor 
in a bid to ensure millennial 
enthusiasm as it’s looked like the 
state may be headed toward one of 
its closest matchups in decades.

In September, Sen. Tim Kaine 

(D–Va.), 
the 
Democratic 
vice 

presidential nominee, came to 
campus. In October, Sanders spoke 
at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art. Capping it all off 
on Monday, one day before the 
election, was President Barack 
Obama, displaying the significance 
that both Michigan and Michigan’s 
millennial vote have suddenly 
come to have in the last days of a 
narrowing race.

In all these of those visits, a 

message has been clear — the vote in 
college towns matters, especially in 
Michigan. The campus enthusiasm 
for 
the 
surrogates 
delivering 

the message has been clear, too. 
Hundreds of people came to see 
Sanders, and an estimated 9,000 
came for Obama.

But at Obama’s speech Monday, 

how that enthusiasm will translate 
to 
Clinton 
wasn’t 
completely 

apparent. Clinton has struggled 
with the narrative that young 
people aren’t enthusiastic about 
her, though polling has showed 
they overwhelmingly prefer her 
over other candidates. In the lead 
up to the event, some students 
were buzzing more about the 
person Clinton sent in her stead, 
than the candidate herself, with 
several shouts of “four more years” 
mingling with chants of “Hillary.”

While waiting in line, Ann Arbor 

resident Mimi Lanseur, wearing an 
Obama T-shirt, and Yaqoota Aziz, 
a recent University alum, said they 
believe there is a gap in enthusiasm 
between Clinton and Obama. Both 
noted, however, that they were still 
very much in support of Clinton.

“I’m less enthusiastic, because I 

don’t like how controversial she is,” 
Aziz said. “But I think she’s just as 
competent.”

“She’s the most qualified person 

to ever run for president in this 
country,” Lanseur said. “Maybe I 
don’t get excited about her the way I 
got excited about Obama, but I trust 
her. And I trust her to make difficult 
decisions. And I trust her to be as 
informed as possible.”

Don, a merchandise vendor at 

Monday’s event who didn’t give 
his last name, spelled out the 

differences in enthusiasm in a more 
quantifiable way.

“With the sales, honestly, if 

it’s Hillary events by herself and 
it’s just Hillary, sales are kind of 
low,” he said. “But when you’ve got 
Barack Obama and Michelle doing 
something with her, or Bernie 
Sanders doing something with her, 
sales are good.”

Sanders 2016 buttons, he added, 

are always a reliable sell.

For the speakers who took the 

stage 
before 
Obama, 
building 

enthusiasm among millennials and 
students was a clear focus. Appeals 
varied from policy topics like from 
Clinton’s higher education plan, 
which aims to create tuition-
free college to individuals with 
families making under 125,000, 
to the Affordable Care Act. The 
importance of this election and 
fighting 
bigotry 
— 
including 

criticisms of Clinton’s opponent, 
Trump — were also themes, as was 
electing the first female president.

“I, as a woman and African 

American, have a lot to lose if this 
election does not go to Hillary 
Clinton,” Rep. Brenda Lawrence 
(D–Southfield) told the crowd, 
stressing the contrast Clinton 
presents to Trump on combatting 
discrimination.

A few minutes later, Rep. Sander 

Levin (D–Royal Oak) highlighted 
Obama administration policies that 
he said have aided young people, 
asking the crowd to raise their 
hands if they had health insurance 
under the Affordable Care Act.

In his remarks, Obama touched 

on many of those same issues, 
though he didn’t make many direct 
appeals to students. Instead, he 
spoke more broadly, telling the 
crowd a Clinton presidency would 
lead to job growth, increased 
equality and aid with student debt 
issues.

“She will work her heart out to 

create jobs that families can live 
on; childcare that you can afford,” 
he said. “She’ll fight for students 
who are struggling with college 
debt. She’ll fight to make sure that 
women get paid the same for doing 
the same work as a guy.”

LSA senior Tamara Hofer, who 

lined up to get into the event at 
5 a.m., said several of the policy 
issues discussed were particularly 
resonant to her as a student.

“Health care is obviously really 

important for me, because 26 isn’t 
that far away for me and I’ll be off 
my parents’ plan,” she said. “But 
also education, and getting more 
people into college.”

For LSA junior Jalal Taleb, 

comments from several speakers 
about combating discriminatory 
rhetoric were particularly poignant, 
including 
those 
on 
fighting 

Islamophobia from Rep. Debbie 
Dingell (D-Mich.).

Among some other students on 

campus, the contrasts to Trump 
were key even if enthusiasm wasn’t 
there. LSA sophomore Nicholas 
Kolenda, president of the former 
Students for Sanders group active 
on campus during the primary, 
said he believed most of the 
individuals who had belonged to 
the organization would turn out for 
the Democrats.

“As far as I can say, I think the 

vast majority of former Sanders 

backers are behind Clinton now- 
rather enthusiastically or to stop 
Trump,” he wrote. “A vast majority 
will vote tomorrow!”

Beyond the issues highlighted by 

the introductory speakers, Obama 
also spoke more directly about his 
legacy, telling the crowd he thought 
he has earned the right to be trusted 
by Michigan voters statewide.

“Plants 
that 
were 
closing 

when I took office are working 
double-shift now,” he said. “The 
auto industry has record sales. I 
think I’ve earned some credibility 
here. Manufacturing jobs have 
grown at the fastest rate since the 
’90s — when another Clinton was 
president. I think we’ve earned 
some credibility here. So when I tell 
you that Donald Trump is not the 
guy who’s going to look out for you, 
you need to listen.”

He charged that in contrast 

to Clinton, Trump is unfit and 
unqualified for the presidency 
because 
of 
his 
temperament, 

business reputation and rhetoric 
about several groups.

“Donald 
Trump 
is 

temperamentally 
unfit 
to 
be 

Commander-in-Chief,” 
he 
said. 

“He’s unqualified to be America’s 
chief executive. He brags that he’s 
a business guy. But we’ve got a lot 
of businessmen and women who 
succeed without stiffing small 
businesses and workers. Once 
they’ve already done work for you, 
and then suddenly you don’t pay 
them?”

LSA senior Jesse Dorbian, who 

said he came to the event to hear 
Obama campaign for Clinton, noted 
that he appreciated hearing about 
Hillary Clinton’s economic work.

“What stood out for me most 

was the fact that Hillary Clinton 
is willing to help out people in 
need and help people get to the 
top, instead of Donald Trump just 
favoring himself,” he said.

Hofer said she thought both 

Obama’s presence and the emphasis 
on his legacy would be a boost in 
Ann Arbor, but that the Clinton 
campaign should still be concerned 
about student turnout.

“I think people are still not as 

enthusiastic as they need to be,” she 
said.

Taleb echoed Hofer’s sentiments.
“Clinton for a while had a 

problem connecting with young 
people, including me, and I’m 
voting for her tomorrow,” he said. 
“Having (Obama) here in Ann 
Arbor to boost that millennial vote 
was really important.”

Nonetheless, for at least some 

people in line Monday, whether 
or not Clinton garners the kind of 
enthusiasm generated by Obama 
won’t be all that matters as they 
head to the polls on Election Day.

“Obama was special in a lot 

of ways, but Hillary Clinton … 
thinking about the fact that I have 
the privilege of voting for a woman 
for president, like right now, that 
makes me want to cry,” Lanseur 
said. “I don’t need to be excited 
about it. It’s way bigger than that 
for me.”

Tuesday, Democrats will find 

out if it’s the kind of revolution 
millennials statewide are ready to 
be a part of.

RALLY
From Page 1

putting Democratic presidential 
nominee Hillary Clinton at about 
three points ahead of Republican 
presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump. 

At the same time, polls in the 

2012 election also suggested a 
narrowing lead between Obama 
and former Republican nominee 
Mitt Romney ahead of the election. 
Despite being within five points of 
Romney in the weeks before the 
election, Obama won the state by a 
9.5 point margin.

Along 
with 
Obama, 
other 

Democratic 
politicians 
and 

candidates spoke at the rally, 
including Larry Deitch (D) and 
Denise Ilitch (D), candidates for 
the University’s Board of Regents, 
as well as Reps. Debbie Dingell (D–
Mich.), Brenda Lawrence (–Mich.), 
Sandy Levin (D–Mich.) and Sen. 
Gary Peters (D–Mich.).

Republicans, too, have realized 

the potential Trump has to turn 
Michigan red. The candidate has 
spent a significant amount of time 
in the state in the days leading up 
to the election. In the past week, 
he has made two stops in the state, 
with his running mate Gov. Mike 
Pence (R–Ind.) making three. 
There have been several other 
stops in the state by his children 
Ivanka, Eric and Donald Trump Jr.

On Monday, both Clinton and 

Trump visited Grand Rapids, 
Mich. on their last day on the 
campaign trail, while Obama 
aimed to get out the vote at the 
University. 

But regardless of the tight polls 

and uptick in visits, the likelihood 
of anything a GOP win remains 
low, according to pollsters and 
experts. 
The 
FiveThirtyEight 

election 
forecast, 
created 
by 

combining polls from across the 
country with historical trends, 
Monday night put Clinton with a 

78.1 percent chance of winning the 
state. 

Political Science Prof. Vincent 

Hutchings, who is an expert in 
voting behavior and elections, said 
though polls are tight currently, 
there is a low likelihood that 
Trump will pull through.

“I doubt it will be a blowout here 

in Michigan, but I nevertheless 
expect the Democrats to win here 
as they have for the last several 
presidential elections,” Hutchings 
said. “I understand why Trump 
is trying to flip the state, and why 
Democrats are trying to counter 
those efforts, but it seems to me 
that there’s a very low probability 
that the state will go Republican 
this year.”

Aaron Kall, the University’s 

director of debate and an election 
expert, estimated that Democrats 
have a 75 percent chance of 
winning the state of Michigan.

“Early 
voting 
has 
now 

concluded in several battleground 
states, so it makes sense for Clinton 
to spend much of her Sunday and 
Monday in states where a plurality 
of the voters won’t vote until 
Tuesday,” Kall said. “These are 
the places she should be making 
her closing argument in person. 
Democratic officials have said 
off the record they are concerned 
about Michigan, but they are likely 
saying this to make sure voters 
remain enthusiastic and actually 
show up at the polls on Tuesday.”

Kall said he foresees the Clinton 

campaign strategy as focused on 
holding Michigan, Pennsylvania 
and Wisconsin, so there is no way 
for Trump to win — even if he were 
to win traditional swing states.

Coming to Ann Arbor and the 

University of Michigan at this 
point in the race is particularly 
notable in itself. The most recent 
Michigan Daily poll of students 
for a three-way race with Clinton, 
Trump and “other” put Clinton as 
the winner by a broad margin of 87 
percent to 13 percent in support of 

Trump.

Volunteers of all parties on 

campus — including heavy efforts 
from the Democrats in particular 
— have also emphasized the 
student vote. Michigan Daily 
polling data shows 93 percent of 
students are registered to vote, 
though 
students 
on 
average 

usually turn out in lower numbers.

Hutchings said the appeal to 

college students is mixed because 
while younger people vote at 
lower rates, on average people 
who are more educated vote at 
higher rates.

“The student vote has some 

significance especially for the 
Democrats,” 
Hutchings 
said. 

“Historically, 
younger 
people 

are less likely to vote but turnout 
is also associated with high 
education. So, college students 
will turn out relative to young 
people without a college education 
and this year this demographic is 
trending Democratic.”

Hutchings said for Clinton, 

where every little bit counts, these 
student votes could mean a lot 
overall.

Kall 
reiterated 
his 
point 

that Democrats may be more 
interested in energizing the young 
population through visits like 
Obama’s, rather than concerned 
about losing the state as a whole.

“The 
millennial 
vote 
is 

becoming crucial to the overall 
election,” Kall said. “These voters 
overwhelmingly favor Clinton, 
but are sometimes apathetic about 
voting.”

During his remarks Monday, 

however, the president largely 
stuck to local to state issues rather 
than student issues.

He devoted a lot of time to 

addressing 
the 
concerns 
of 

Michigan voters — not just 
students.

his 
election 
must 

culminate in a vote for 
Democratic presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton. Yes, 
her opponent is racist, sexist, 
misogynistic and xenophobic, 
but Clinton is a candidate we 
need to be excited about. She is 
the most qualified presidential 
candidate 
in 
history, 
her 

platform is the most progressive 
and her career of fighting for 
those without a voice speaks for 
itself. Beyond just the vote for 
the presidency, this election will 
play a critical role in determining 
how both the national and 
state legislatures operate in the 
coming years.

Clinton 
has 
noted 
that 

throughout 
her 
career, 
her 

favorability 
plummets 
while 

on the campaign trail, then 
skyrockets while actually on 
the job. She’s a public servant, 
not a campaigner. Clinton gives 
long, boring, intricately detailed 
explanations to basic questions 
in debates. Her stump speeches 
are a policy wonk’s dream, but 
they fail to capture the heart and 
soul of the average American. 
She may not thrill crowds like 
Bernie Sanders or President 
Barack Obama, but she has a 
wealth of policy knowledge and 
political experience, receiving 
praise 
from 
Democrats 
and 

Republicans alike for her time 
serving in the U.S. Senate. She 
is ready for the job, and nearly 
all her professional experience 
thus far has prepared her to 
lead the nation. From college 

affordability 
to 
investing 

in 
infrastructure, 
from 

environmental 
protection 
to 

criminal justice reform, Clinton 
has detailed plans to overcome 
the incredible challenges our 
next president will face.

But one race alone will not 

determine the future of our 
country, our state or even our 
community. Democrats have a 
strong chance to take back the 
U.S. Senate, and the House of 
Representatives could be in play 
as well. Clinton alone cannot 
pass 
the 
sweeping 
reforms 

this country desperately needs 
— Congress must turn blue, 
too. We’ve seen what a hostile 
Republican majority has done 
to President Obama’s agenda, 
and it’s safe to assume the 
obstruction and gridlock would 
continue if Democrats don’t win 
control of Congress.

We all know the stakes of this 

election. I would never argue that 
the presidential election isn’t the 
most important race on the ballot 
— especially for this vitriolic 
election. But even if progressive 
dreams come true and the White 
House, Senate and House of 
Representatives all go blue, much 
of that may still be for nothing 
in Michigan if Democrats do not 
win back the Michigan House of 
Representatives.

Michigan state government is 

currently under full Republican 
control, and we desperately need 
an institutional check on that. 
Despite winning more total votes 
in 2014, Democrats lost four seats 

in the state House and one in the 
state Senate, giving Republicans 
a large majority in the House and 
the Senate. With gubernatorial 
and Senate elections occurring 
during 
midterms, 
the 
best 

opportunity to change the outlook 
of state politics is for Democrats to 
win a majority in the state House.

State governments have a 

much larger impact on our daily 
lives than most people give them 
credit for. Gov. Rick Snyder ran 
as a moderate Republican and is 
still widely referred to as such, 
yet has shown little strength 
standing up to his further-right 
Republican colleagues in the 
legislature and simply signs off 
on just about anything they put 
on his desk. We desperately need 
a check on Republican policies, 
and 
a 
Democratic 
majority 

would give us a necessary voice 
that could not be ignored.

Denying the Flint water crisis, 

mismanaging 
Detroit 
Public 

Schools, refusal to grant civil 
rights protections to LGBTQ+ 
citizens, cutting budgets of higher 
education, 
slashing 
revenue 

sharing for local communities, 
banning libraries from circulating 
factual 
information 
about 

elections — this list goes on and 
on, including everything from 
life-threatening 
and 
horribly 

apathetic 
to 
ridiculous 
and 

almost-cartoonish attempts to 
restrain 
democratic 
processes 

and 
retain 
Republicans’ 

stranglehold on state politics. 
Collectively, these policies have 
devastated the state of Michigan. 

We desperately need a check on 
these dangerous policies, and a 
Democratic majority would give 
us a necessary voice.

Hillary 
Clinton 
and 

Democrats across the ballot 
have my vote and deserve yours. 
The system is not rigged as some 
people suggest, but institutional 
racism, sexism, homophobia and 
many other systemic problems 
persist. Solutions to these issues 
and progressive change in this 
country are possible. We need 
to come together and vote for 
the candidates who represent 
our values and our hopes for the 
future — not to make America 
great again, but to make it better 
than it is now and has ever been. 
This election is about us and 
what vision we have for our 
country. It’s about time that our 
governments — at all levels — 
begin to reflect our values.

So go out and vote. Encourage 

your friends and family to vote. 
Help out at polling locations. 
Volunteer 
for 
get-out-the-vote 

shifts. This is the most important 
day of the next four years, and the 
future of our country is truly in 
our hands. We can continue the 
progress of President Obama and 
help create an even better future 
for all Americans by electing 
Hillary Clinton and Democrats 
down the ballot.

Why I wrote in Paul Ryan

MAX RYZSTAK | COLUMN

A

s a young, conservative 
Republican, 
this 

election 
has 
been 

very 
disappointing. 
Ever 

since Republican presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump entered the 
race, he’s hijacked 
the 
conversation 

and kept the nation’s 
focus 
away 
from 

actual policies and 
proposals. As it is 
highly unlikely that 
Republicans 
like 

myself, 
who 
are 

unsatisfied 
with 

Trump, 
will 
vote 

for Hillary, a relatively large 
percentage of the American 
electorate is left without a 
candidate 
who 
accurately 

represents 
a 
significant 

proportion of their political 
opinions. 

Personally, I cannot support 

Trump due to his lack of firm 
policy positions. His absence of 
positive vision and knowledge 
of actual solutions don’t make 
him qualified to be president. 
Whether 
regarding 
trade, 

immigration, 
social 
issues, 

international policy or taxes, 
Trump 
understands 
neither 

the 
fundamental 
problems 

nor the potential solutions. 
He doesn’t recognize how to 
bring people together, how 
to lead a nation or how to 
conduct himself. Democratic 
presidential nominee Clinton, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
has 
the 

temperament, 
but 
not 
the 

policy, to be president. 

Thankfully, 
however, 

citizens have the opportunity 
to choose beyond the two major 
party candidates by writing 
in their candidate of choice. 
While chances for write-in 
candidates actually winning 
are next to nothing, fully 
exercising my right to vote 
as a person who represents 
my values and ideas gives 
me the opportunity to take a 
stand against both Trump and 
Clinton. A lot of people think 
exercising this right is a joke, 
but when the issues we are 

dealing with are this complex 
and serious, your ballot truly 
representing you is important. 
Writing in candidates can send 
a message to the country, to the 

parties and to the 
candidates.

That’s why, this 

year, 
I 
chose 
to 

write 
in 
Speaker 

of the House Paul 
Ryan (R). Seemingly 
opposite of Trump, 
Ryan has the policy 
experience 
needed 

to proudly represent 
the 
Republican 

Party. His agenda of 

helping everybody — people of 
all races, religions and cultures 
— can move the Republican 
Party into the future. He 
doesn’t just understand the 
actual specifics of his policies; 
he also has the ability to 
explain these complex and 
specific policies to the masses. 
From his speeches to his social 
media campaigns and videos, 
Paul Ryan can communicate 
with a wide variety of people. 
He knows how to help those 
suffering and he knows how to 
bring people of all backgrounds 
together. 
Ryan’s 
way 
of 

communicating with the public 
is in stark contrast with the 
embarrassing 
methods 
of 

Trump. Ryan can diversify 
the party and make it proud, 
whereas Trump will do the 
exact opposite. 

What’s unique about Ryan 

is that his “A Better Way” 
package of ideas represents a 
comprehensive set of solutions 
for 
many 
of 
our 
nation’s 

problems. He lays out actual 
proposals on issues varying 
from 
poverty 
to 
national 

security to health care to the 
Constitution and sends a clear 
message through his solutions. 
Whether or not you agree 
with this vision or not, many 
candidates fail to provide their 
goals for America in the policies 
they propose. Paul Ryan is 
different; he is educated on the 
policy and can inspire people 
with his proposals.

Take, for example, his plans 

on poverty. He traveled around 
the country as a part of a 
documentary to get different 
perspectives on poverty in our 
nation today, so he knows what 
we need to do to get people to 
improve their socioeconomic 
situation. 
His 
prioritization 

of advancing the situation of 
the 
disadvantaged 
through 

conservative policy is what 
the Republican Party (and the 
country) needs.

He 
also 
knows 
how 
to 

communicate with those from 
all different backgrounds. In 
talking with those who typically 
hold different political views, 
Ryan’s outreach demonstrates 
a prioritization of country over 
politics. He truly cares about 
the lives of all people. In fact, 
that’s what separates Ryan. 
His compassion, humility and 
simple upbringing may sound 
stereotypical of any politician, 
but Paul Ryan is truly the 
opposite of a Washington elite. 
His willingness to unite people 
is what separates him.

This election year is the 

first time I am able to vote in 
a presidential election, and 
I — along with many — do not 
support either major candidate. 
I’ve chosen to write in the 
speaker of the House. While I 
know he won’t win, I know that 
he represents the Republican 
Party many people like myself 
aspire for. My vote for Ryan is 
a vote for Republicans of the 
likes of Marco Rubio, Nikki 
Haley and Ronald Reagan. 

Having the opportunity to 

write in my own candidate 
allows me to truly vote with 
my conscience. It’s a vote 
against Hillary’s corruption and 
Trump’s lack of intelligence. It 
allows me to vote for the party I 
hope to be a part of rather than 
the party that exists this year. 
It’s a vote for true Conservatives 
who propose meaningful and 
hopeful policies.

FROM THE DAILY

Be sure to vote smart

A 

month ago, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held an 11-point lead over 
Donald Trump. As of Monday night, that had dwindled to a 3-point lead. 
Michigan hasn’t gone red since 1988, but in the last three days, President 

Barack Obama and presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton 
have all targeted Michigan voters. Monday, Obama campaigned for Clinton at Ray 
L. Fisher Stadium taking a personal approach: He made it clear that not voting 
or voting in support of Trump would be a personal insult to him and reverse the 
eight years of work his administration has done. Michigan’s status as one of the 
only states that doesn’t have early voting and that historically has low turnout at 
the polls are two of many reasons why candidates are targeting our state, and are 
the exact reasons why it is so important to vote today. In particular, millennials 
have been criticized in the past for not showing up to the polls, so this is our call to 
students: Vote today and make the headlines “Millennials defeat Trump.”

Given these historical statistics, 

and given that Trump has been 
polling higher in Michigan leading 
up to Election Day, it’s vitally 
important for students to have a 
strong presence at the polls. There 
are a lot of resources for students 
on campus that make it easier to 
vote: ridesharing services such 
as Zipcar, Lyft and Uber are all 
working to get the vote out. For 
example, Zipcar is making 7,000 
cars free nationwide between 
6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Election 
Day. Lyft and Uber also have 
certain Election Day discounts to 
varying degrees, which students 
should keep in mind if physically 
getting to the polls is a problem 
financially 
or 
logistically. 
On 

campus, 
students 
themselves 

are mobilizing by hosting watch 
parties, holding rallies, making 

posts on social media and offering 
rides to polling locations. Some 
professors have given passes to 
students who have demonstrated 
they will use class time to go vote, 
which is commendable.

Each student’s vote has a 

wide-ranging impact, from the 
international political arena to 
our campus community here in 
Ann Arbor. In the past weeks, the 
University community has faced 
racist incidents that have injured 
our already-poor campus climate. 
Because of Trump’s dangerous 
rhetoric, a vote against Trump is a 
vote to stop this type of hatred on 
campus. Though there has been 
a shift among student voting for 
Clinton instead of third parties or 
alternative write-in candidates, 
according to a Michigan Daily 
polling data, it is important to keep 

in mind that unless a candidate 
has officially registered to be a 
write-in candidate, a vote for that 
candidate will not count.

It’s also important to know 

your rights as a voter. You have a 
right to vote in private, free from 
intimidation or interference. If 
you think your rights are being 
violated, notify a poll monitor 
at your location of voting. These 
people should be easily identifiable 
and will know what to do in case of 
suspected illegal activity. You can 
also file a civil rights complaint 
to the Department of Justice by 
calling the Civil Rights Division 
at (800) 253-3931 to reach the 
Discrimination Complaint number 
or (202) 307-2767 to reach the 
Voting Section of the Department 
of Jusice. 

Be sure to vote, and vote smart.

HARVEST RECORDS.

If this were a profile picture, it would get a billion likes.

It was the afternoon of the 

second day of the Mo Pop Fes-
tival, and I had succeeded in 
aggressively pushing my way 
to the front row. Friends in 
tow and the hot sun beating 
down on the unforgiving July 
day, I wrapped sweaty hands 
around the fence barrier that 
separated the crowd from the 
stage and waited for the band I 
had been ready for ever since I 
heard they were performing at 
Mo Pop: Matt and Kim.

We 
all 
were 
physically 

drained, with strange bruises 
in even stranger places. All I 
wanted to do was find a semi-
quiet corner and close my eyes 
for 20 minutes (or 20 years). 
What we all needed then was 
the music festival equivalent 
of an espresso shot — a set 
that would inject excitement 
straight into our bones like 
fizzy champagne. What we all 
needed then was a reminder of 
why we suffered all day under 
the scorching sun, of how all-
encompassing and life-chang-
ing music festivals could be. 
Matt and Kim did not disap-
point.

From the moment they leapt 

onto the stage, Matt and Kim 
made every note burst into 
a kinetic energy. Flawlessly, 
fearlessly 
and 
effortlessly, 

they grabbed our attention 
with their explosiveness. With 
wild smiles and wilder dance 
moves, Matt and Kim made a 
promise to us: no matter what 
happened, they wouldn’t fail 
to deliver us a chaotic, crazy, 
impossibly 
amazing 
perfor-

mance.

And they committed to put-

ting on the best show no matter 
what problems occurred, like 
the sound cutting out a quar-
ter of the way through their 
set. Instead of leaving early or 
postponing, Matt and Kim did 
what they did best: put on some 
delightfully artificial, booty-
poppin’ jams, climbed out from 
the stage into the crowd and 
twerked on some hands. Even 
though we didn’t hear a major-
ity of their songs because of the 
technical difficulties (thanks, 
Mo Pop!), I still feel like I got to 
experience the best part of see-
ing Matt and Kim live.

It’s a quality that transcends 

the actual songs they perform 
and manifests itself in the 
way they naturally pass ener-
gy between themselves and 
the audience. Infusing every 
moment with boundless enthu-
siasm, Matt and Kim have an 
infectious personability that 
made me, standing on the dirty 
grass littered with empty bot-
tles and forgotten cigarettes, 
feel connected to them and to 
the raving crowd around me 
and to the music that trembled 
in the air around us like a live 
wire.

Plus I got to touch Kim’s calf 

as she crowd-surfed above me 
so it was pretty much the best 

moment of my life.

Performances 
like 
Matt 

and Kim’s at Mo Pop are the 
reason I love music festivals 
so much. Surrounded by hun-
dreds of random strangers, I 
have become part of a mass of 
disjointed waving arms and 
whirling bodies, but instead 
of feeling claustrophobic, I’m 
united and in-tune with the 
boundless vitality that emits 
from the crowd like a wave.

It’s a beautiful moment: 

looking around at a concert and 
seeing the absolute joy on the 
faces of other people as they 
scream the lyrics they finally 
get to see live. Music has a 
particular skill in creating 
art out of a series of notes and 
rhythms, and a good concert 
is one which takes that mas-
terpiece and brings it to life. 
Songs become tangible in the 
sense that you can feel the beat 
in your bones and the notes as 
they brush over your skin.

And on that July afternoon, 

watching Matt and Kim pour 
everything they had out on 
stage, I felt like I could reach 
over and hold melodies in 
the palm of my hand as they 
bounced from the stage to the 
crowd, lighting up the sunrise 
with a vigor that made me for-
get my sore feet, badly burnt 
shoulders and aching legs. In 
that moment, with the swell 
of the music overpowering all 
senses, I felt part of something 
larger, like there was a pull to 
lose myself in both the crowd 
and the music. It was com-
munity in its most basic form: 
a group of people gathering 
together for the simple reason 
of experiencing the music that 
we all loved.

BEST CONCERT EVER

Before knocking on doors and 

encouraging people to vote on 
Election Day, the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats rallied Monday night 
with students and Democrats 
from around the state at the Ford 

School of Public Policy.

About 30 people were in atten-

dance at the event. Speakers such 
as U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–
Mich.) and state Rep. Gretchen 
Driskell 
(D–Saline) 
stressed 

that University students will be 
responsible for being influential 
in not just the presidential elec-
tion, but also state and local offic-
es. Earlier in the day, President 

Barack Obama came to campus to 
campaign for Democratic presi-
dential Nominee Hillary Clinton.

“The millennials matter — 

that’s why Obama came this 
morning,” Dingell said. “You 
guys do matter. Your vote mat-
ters and you can’t take anything 
for granted.”

State Rep. Gretchen Driskell (D-Saline), Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, rallies College 
Democrats at Weill Hall Monday. 
Democratic candidates Dingell, 
Driskell rally at event Monday night

Representatives stress need for students to vote down the ticket

coordinator, said the rally was a 
celebration for the group to rec-
ognize of all the work they have 
done campaigning for every 
major local, state and national 
election. After the event, stu-
dents split up into groups and left 
to “dorm storm” — where they 
visit several dorms to give out 
information about the Democrat-
ic candidates — as well as to chalk 
campus and hang flyers.

“It’s to get people excited and 

ready to not only go out and vote 
but volunteer to get students out 
to vote,” Kelly said in an inter-
view. “We know with student 
who vote for Democrats in such 
high numbers, all we need to do 
is turn them out and it’s great for 
Democrats.”

Kelly said on Election Day, 

College Democrats plan to work 
with groups such as Students for 
Hillary to get students to vote 
because many who vote Demo-
cratic at the top of the ballot also 
vote Democratic at the bottom, 
meaning their vote for president 
is likely to reflect their choice for 
an office such as the University 
Board of Regents as well.

“We’ve really been working 

with all the Democrats we can 
and helping in any capacity we 
can,” Kelly said.

Kelly said having politicians 

from across the state at the event 
was a strong incentive for the 
students present. He noted the 
College Democrats have worked 

in a number of campaigns this 
election season, including mak-
ing calls and going door to door 
for Democratic candidates such 
as Lon Johnson, a candidate for 
Michigan’s 1st federal Congres-
sional District, and Gretchen 
Driskell a candidate for Michi-
gan’s 7th Congressional District, 
who are from Traverse City and 
Ann Arbor, respectively.

“We are committed to Demo-

crats up and down the ballot,” 
Kelly said. “We can’t just focus 
on one, because we have a lot of 
energy and a lot of enthusiasm 
and a lot of our members have 
experience.”

Dingell, who is running for 

reelection, said at the rally that 
she has unwavering support for 
Democratic presidential nomi-
nee Hillary Clinton, and cited 
their personal history as reason-
ing for her conviction.

“The woman that I know, the 

Hillary Clinton that’s been my 
friend, never gives up, never 
stops fighting and is one of the 
smartest and savviest people 
that I know,” Dingell said. “She 
looks at a problem and says, ‘how 
do we bring people together?’ ”

Dingell also said she believes 

after Clinton is elected, she 
will resume efforts to unite the 
nation.

“How do we remember that 

we are Americans first?” Dingell 
asked. “I saw her when she went 
to the Senate, she worked with 

people on both sides of the aisle 
to solve problems, to address and 
attack issues — and that’s who 
she’s going to be when we do 
elect her president.”

freshman Sierra Stephens said 
the presence of lesser known 
candidates — such as state rep. 
candidates Yousef Rabhi and 
Donna Lasinski — at the event 
was helpful for her as a voter.

“Overall, I think it’s really 

awesome to see all of the dif-
ferent local candidates speak, 
because I think people overlook 
that,” Stephens said.

Driskell, who, like Dingell, is 

also up for reelection, praised 
the group for their work cam-
paigning, and urged them not to 
stop campaigning until the polls 
close.

“You’re ready to get to work,” 

Driskell said. “We have less than 
24 hours left. I’m here because I 
want to say thank you. It’s been 
a fantastic day. Your organiza-
tion was the one that carried us 
across the finish line.”

LSA freshman Evan Swine-

hart said his motivation for his 
organization doubled after both 
seeing Obama speak Monday on 
campus and attending the Col-
lege Democrats event. 

KEVIN BIGLIN
Daily Staff Reporter

The masterminds Jim Jar-

musch 
(“Only 
Lovers 
Left 

Alive”) and Iggy Pop combine 
to retell the messy 
story of one of the 
most 
influential 

American 
bands 

of all time. After 
over 40 years, The 
Stooges’ 
antics 

and 
genius 
are 

finally 
captured 

in one fine-tuned 
documentary 
that shies away from nothing. 
“Gimme Danger” is one of the 
most gripping music documen-
taries released in recent years, 
one any music lover should add 
to their must-see list.

The documentary tells the 

band’s story from their nascent 
high school years in Ann Arbor 
to the post “Raw Power” slump. 
Although popularly known for 
his solo work and friendship 
with David Bowie, “Gimme 
Danger” doesn’t focus on Iggy 
Pop’s (James Osterberg) star-
dom. In fact, “Lust for Life” and 
other Iggy hits make no appear-
ance at all. Everything Stooges 
related is central for the docu-
mentary, focusing on the band 
and not just the front man.

“Gimme 
Danger” 
includes 

eye-catching animations that 
retell hysterical stories involv-
ing mobile homes and stagediv-
ing-related injuries. Stylistically, 
the documentary is a clear result 
of creative savants combining 
their greatest strengths into 
one work. Every edit perfectly 
reflects the loose structure of 
The Stooges, but with precision 
and authenticity.

The documentary is pro-

pelled by interviews from each 
surviving member of the band, 
all providing perhaps-too-clear 

recollections 
of 
such 
foggy 

events. Without the charisma 
and wit of the members, this 
documentary would be noth-
ing but semi-entertaining music 
history with fun graphics and 

animations.

In 
Particular, 

Iggy’s 
insight-

ful 
story 
about 

the drawbacks of 
being a drummer 
feels more like a 
comedy 
routine 

than a part of a 
music 
documen-

tary. 
Essentially, 

staring at other peoples’ butts 
gets old after awhile. If any-
thing, this is a metaphor for life; 
never being the center of atten-
tion takes its toll.

“Gimme Danger” balances live 

performances with interviews 
just like any strong music docu-
mentary, but it feels especially 
fluid here. The Stooges were not 
a boring live band to watch. Iggy 
Pop, rumored to be the inventor 
of the stage dive, knew how to 
win over an entire audience with 
unique dances and self-induced 
harm. Occasionally, it was a bit 
excessive, but nonetheless pro-
vides great material for a music 
documentary.

A beginner’s guide to The 

Stooges should be included with 
every student’s summer orien-
tation itinerary at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. As Ann Arbor’s 

most successful and respected 
band of all time, they are an inte-
gral part of the college town’s 
rich history of counter-culture 
movements.

Opposed to the vacuous hip-

pie themes dominating the zeit-
geist of the late ’60s, The Stooges 
set out to make music not artifi-
cially created in record company 
boardrooms. Particularly, the 
story behind their performance 
at the Michigan Union ballroom 
will shock Michigan students 
and Ann Arborites alike. Today, 
it is nearly impossible to imag-
ine the walls and floors of the 
ballroom rattling to the sounds 
of “I Wanna Be Your Dog.”

Iggy’s spontaneous post-riot 

move to Detroit sums up the 
entire model that The Stooges 
operated under: pure unorga-
nized madness that somehow 
ended in musical genius. “I went 
to Detroit with a tab of mesca-
line and a shovel,” he says in the 
film.

And later in the documentary, 

an array of punk albums flows 
across the screen, ranging from 
behemoths like The Ramones to 
cult favorites like Gang of Four. 
Such bands did not necessar-
ily rip off of The Stooges’ sound 
directly, but it is unlikely that 
the punk soundscape would be 
the same without their immense 
influence.

“Gimme Danger” is the rein-

troduction everyone needed, a 
reminder that The Stooges are 
still one of the greatest bands on 
earth. For any Ann Arbor native 
or frequente visitor photos of 
the band members on State St. 
and Liberty St. will send chills 
to the spine. It is a true bragging 
right to have Iggy Pop and The 
Stooges under the “notable peo-
ple” section of the Ann Arbor 
Wikipedia page. It just reinforc-
es that Ann Arbor is the greatest 
college town in the country.

B

y the time this column 
appears in print, people 
all across America will 

have begun casting their votes for 
the next President of the United 
States.

It feels like 

there’s no real 
point to writing 
more about this 
election; every-
thing that can be 
said already has 
been said, at least 
until early, early 
Wednesday morn-
ing. All of America 
waits with bated 
breath.

We’ve all watched the trajec-

tory of overabundant media cov-
erage of Republican presidential 
nominee Trump’s campaign 
fiasco. There have been a stun-
ning amount of Republicans 
who have withdrawn their sup-
port for Trump after more and 
more of his blatant disrespect 
towards women and minority 
communities surface, and an 
overabundance of celebrities and 
companies coming out to openly 
endorse Democratic presidential 
nominee Hillary Clinton, with 
the latest being Beyonce.

Though it may feel obvi-

ous that this election has been 
steeped in gender politics, the 
analysis that could have been 
devoted to dissecting them 
has been channeled into the 
ridiculousness of the Republican 
candidate’s entire campaign. 
It isn’t that we have not talked 
about gender playing a role in 
this election — it’s just that these 
conversations have always given 
way to other things due to the 
very nature of Trump’s attempts 
at politicking. If Clinton had 
been running against someone 
with actual experience, like Mitt 
Romney or Sen. John McCain 
(R-AL), to name those of recent 
memory, there would have been 
a lot more talk about gender poli-
tics as there would have been at 

least a baseline of professional 
politics on both sides. The presi-
dential debates would have been 
substantive.

Because of this — how some 

of the attention that 
could have gone to 
dissecting the gender 
politics was redirect-
ed into discussions 
about how Trump is, 
frankly, an idiot — it 
seems that during 
discussions about 
whether Clinton 
has unfairly played 
the “woman card” 
throughout the elec-
tion, the distinction 

has never been made between the 
two meanings of that phrase, and 
how Clinton’s campaign has capi-
talized on both of them.

Once Trump accused Clinton 

of playing the “woman card,” 
her team had a field day, because 
we are finally at a time when a 
significant portion of the country 
— though not a majority, by any 
means — understands that the 
“woman card” as Donald puts it, 
doesn’t really exist.

When Trump supporters talk 

about “the woman card” and 
criticize Hillary for using it, what 
they are complaining about is 
how Clinton has the ability, as a 
woman, to claim an added layer 
of authority over women’s issues 
that Trump, who claims that no 
one respects women more than 
he does, is unfairly barred from. 
The complaint over playing the 
woman card is that it is an unfair 
claim to sympathy over prob-
lems that aren’t really affecting 
women anymore.

Conversely, when Clinton and 

her supporters talk about the 
woman card, they have recog-
nized the level of irony that the 
phrase operates on — because 
the reality is that the “woman 
card” is still “played” because 
those inequalities do, in fact, still 
exist for women. If playing the 
“woman card” means that she is 

going to be criticized for openly 
talking about these issues faced 
by women all across America, she 
has made it pretty clear that she’s 
going to play it every round. This 
is why she is selling a physical 
woman’s card on her website; this 
is why once Trump called her a 
“nasty woman,” her supporters 
immediately acted to reclaim it, 
trending the term on platforms 
like Twitter, Facebook and 
Instagram. If you type in nasty-
womengetshitdone.com, you are 
redirected to her official website.

Clinton’s campaign was astute-

ly aware of the social climate 
in that they did not just strive 
to convey that they are willing 
and able to work on what have 
typically been cast as “women’s 
issues.” They also conveyed that 
they understand the ironies sur-
rounding today’s discussions 
of women’s issues as embodied 
through discussions of playing 
the “woman card,” and EVEN 
came at it with a sense of humor. 

Because her campaign has 

been so aware of these two 
meanings of the woman card 
throughout the entire campaign, 
it can actually be more difficult 
to analyze how gender politics 
are actually insidiously at work. A 
mere few months from now, it’ll 
be slightly easier.

Some people are thrilled at the 

thought of Hillary Clinton being 
the first woman president, and 
some people are only grudgingly 
casting their votes in her favor 
because they know she’s better 
than the alternative. But regard-
less of if/how she wins, she will 
have done something that two 
years ago, no one would have 
thought her capable of doing — 
injecting an element of humor 
in what, at times, feels to be a 
humorless situation by turning 
the use of the “woman card” on 
its head.

The role of the nasty 

woman card

The comedian-auteur genre of 

television has never been more 
robust. Lena Dunham’s “Girls,” 
Issa Rae’s “Inse-
cure,” 
Donald 

Glover’s “Atlanta” 
— the writer-cre-
ator-star triumvi-
rate is healthy and 
operating at full 
capacity. What’s 
most 
refreshing 

about this trend is the specific-
ity of voices; each series is filmed 
through such a unique perspec-
tive that the template is at once 
simple and difficult to replicate. 
Forgiving an inexplicable title 
then, Netflix’s “Chewing Gum” 
is a confident, high-energy and 
hilarious volley from across the 
pond that more than earns its 
spot among the best of them.

The show is, of course, created 

by, written by and starring one 
woman: British poet and play-
wright Michaela Coel (“London 
Spy”), who developed the show 
from a previous play she had 
written. Drawing on her Gha-
naian background, Coel plays 
Tracey, a 24-year-old woman 
whose defining characteristic is 
her repressed sexuality. Tracey 
is a virgin, but a reluctant one: 
she has been raised by the most 
conservatively religious of par-
ents, has a sister, Cynthia (Susan 

Wokoma, “Crazyhead”), whose 
vision of a perfect life is playing 
board games with her mother 
and sister for eternity and a 
disturbingly uptight betrothed, 
Ronald (“Critical”), who’s the 

kind of guy that 
chucks a Bible at 
you if you take off 
your clothes and 
come on to him.

It’s 
impossible 

to watch “Chewing 
Gum” — a British 
import from chan-

nel E4 — without noticing the 
shades of a number of differ-
ent shows: there are the casual 
fourth-wall 
transgressions 

reminiscent of “Fleabag,” the 
hilarious raunchiness of “Catas-
trophe” permeates the entire 
comedic sensibility, it shares its 
subject matter with “Jane the 
Virgin” and there’s even a hint 
of the old “Skins” in its portray-
al of a younger, working-class, 
diverse London. It’s fascinating 
to see a potent mix of approach-
es that years earlier would have 
never been possible on TV.

The sense of humor, though, is 

wholly unique. Coel is interest-
ed in progressive sexuality con-
flicting with traditional ideas of 
religious chastity, but there is 
never a dull or heavy moment. 
The jokes are bawdy and well-
written, and Coel herself is a 
marvel of comic timing. Coel’s 
ability to wring hard-earned 

laughs from a simple reaction 
shot is reminiscent of “Atlan-
ta” ’s Brian Tyree Henry. The 
surrounding players are also 
precise and effective at their 
line delivery. One particularly 
hilarious exchange involves a bit 
character advising Tracey to sit 
on a man’s face: “Just perch on 
it, love.”

“Chewing Gum” ’s London 

is also impressively specific in 
its vision. The bubblegum pop 
type of set design means there 
bright bursts of color in every 
scene. The cinematography is 
hyper-kinetic, and the show is 
bursting with unbridled energy. 
This becomes somewhat jarring 
when the show tries to hit its 
more emotional beats, like the 
introduction of Tracey’s love 
interest, Connor (Robert Lons-
dale, “The Interceptor”), but the 
inevitable sex scene between the 
two of them that bookends the 
first episode is at once fascinat-
ingly honest and laugh-out-loud 
funny.

What’s most inspiring about 

“Chewing Gum,” though, is the 
mere fact of its existence. This 
is a raunchy, explicit, hilarious 
show about sex, religion and 
virginity with a Black woman at 
the center of it all. It’s clear this 
is the show Coel set out to make, 
and to witness her brushing up 
against the constraints of Brit-
ish television is heartening. It’s 
not hard to fall in love.

On Friday in Rackham Amphi-

theatre, 
University 
Students 

Against Rape hosted Lunafest, 
an annual traveling film program 
sponsored by Luna Bars featuring 
“short films made by, for and about 
women.” 15 percent of event pro-
ceeds were donated to the Breast 
Cancer Fund. The rest are used 
to fund the annual Take Back the 
Night Rally and March against 
sexual assault, which takes place 
in the winter semester.

This year’s program featured 

nine short films spanning a wide 
variety of subjects and styles. For 
example, the documentary “Free 
to Laugh” (Lara Everly) followed a 
group of women using comedy to 
move on after their lives in prison, 
while “The Honeys and the Bears” 
(Veena Rao) gave oft-overlooked 
voice to the elderly, tracking how 
members of a synchronized swim 
team for the elderly find freedom 
and purpose in the water.

My companion and I agreed 

that “Partners” (Joey Alley) was 
one of the night’s standouts. A 
declined bedroom invitation esca-
lates to a same-sex couple arguing 

over their future together (“I get 
the apartment!”), that is at once 
resolved by a piggyback ride out-
side to buy juice. Laughter bubbled 
out in the audience — everyone 
could relate to loving a person, 
and still hating things they do. 
“Partners” zeroed in on a moment 
that is refreshingly mundane, 
and resolved it without fanfare 
— a reminder of what everyday 
romance is like.

The program also featured 

films set outside of the US and in 
languages other than English. 
“Another Kind of Girl” was the 
product of 18 year old Khaldiya 
Jibawi’s first time using a camera. 
She reflects on the courage and 
new mindset she has gained since 
she left Syria for a refugee camp in 
Jordan. Her film’s inclusion in the 
program prioritized the impor-
tance of making one’s story heard, 
dismantling 
traditional 
media 

hierarchies that value years of 
experience and high-tech equip-
ment.

With 
dialogue 
consisting 

mainly of untranslated Spanish, 
“Ninera” (Diane Weipert) showed 
the sad reality of a nanny spending 
the day taking care of other chil-
dren, but not having enough time 

to spend with her own.

From 
Belgian 
filmmaker 

Frederike Migom came “Nkosi 
Coiffure,” a story of intercultural 
perspectives 
coming 
together 

for women to help other women. 
After a fight with her boyfriend, 
a white woman escapes into an 
African hair braiding salon, and 
the women working there give her 
advice and a makeover to help her 
take ownership of her life deci-
sions.

Impressively, 
Lunafest 
was 

more than just a mindless par-
roting of feel-good, Westernized 
feminism — a mindset often used 
to boost corporate sponsors’ repu-
tations. Rather, it took care to pres-
ent nuanced, sometimes difficult 
perspectives that many activist 
groups lack. There is no universal 
experience of womanhood, and 
the program reflects that.

In all these films, Lunafest 

shone a much-needed spotlight 
on female filmmakers and teased 
out the multifaceted experiences 
that women live everyday. From 
laughter, to sorrow, to hope, to 
love, difference in perspective was 
appreciated, then stitched togeth-
er to find universal emotions we 
all share.

‘Grown-up’ Nagelvoort balances patience with urgency

Zach 
Nagelvoort 
got 
one 

game, and then he waited a 
month for his name to be called 
again. And while he may not be 
the man in front of the net when 
the season ends, the senior 
netminder has made his peace 
with that.

Nagelvoort 
earned 
the 

start 
for 
No. 

18 
Michigan’s 

season 
opener 

against 
Union, 

stopping 36 of 
the 
40 
shots 

he 
faced 
that 

night 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ 
4-3 
loss. 
It 

wasn’t a great 
performance. 
He gave up a 
late 
goal 
that 

probably 
should 
have 
been 

saved. 
But 
considering 
the 

number of grade-A chances the 
Dutchmen generated, it was still 
a pretty damn good one.

Then Nagelvoort, like an 

unused toy, went on the shelf. He 
waited while the leaves changed 
color, the calendar flipped over 
and freshmen Hayden Lavigne 
and 
Jack 
LaFontaine 
each 

started three games in net.

For other seniors, spending 

their final season on the bench 
and 
watching 
younger 
kids 

take their spot on the ice could 
have been torture. It seems that 
would be especially true for 
Nagelvoort, who has seen his 
playing time decrease with each 
year in Ann Arbor — playing in 
24 games his freshman year, 
22 his sophomore season and 
just 11 last year. He started his 
second game of the year against 
Arizona State this past Friday, 

nearly a quarter of the way 
through the season.

But Nagelvoort has handled 

it well, perhaps as well as one 
could have.

“I wouldn’t say (it’s tough),” 

Nagelvoort said Monday after 
practice. 
“I 
would 
say 
it’s 

pushing me to be that much 
better of a goalie, because I’m 
not in a position where I can 
say, ‘Ah well, I had an OK week, 

but I’m still the 
starter.’

“That idea of 

complacency 
can’t 
come 
in 

your head — not 
that it has, but it 
leaves no room 
for it, the way 
things are set up 
right now. You’re 
constantly 
having to better 
your game.”

At this level, most goaltenders 

have the physical part of the 
game down. They know how to 
make glove saves, how to make 
blocker saves and how to go 
down into the butterfly.

So 
Nagelvoort 
has 
spent 

most of his time in practice 
focusing on the mental side of 
goaltending, which he says is 
“98 percent” of the game.

“I’ve seen a player that has 

acted like a senior (and) like a 
leader, that has competed hard 
every day even though he hadn’t 
played in a month,” Berenson 
said. “(Nagelvoort’s) shown a 
really good attitude. He’s grown 
up a lot. I think he used to worry 
about some of the things that 
were out of his control, and now, 
I think he’s got everything in 
perspective, and it looks like it in 
the way he acts and practices.”

While 
Nagelvoort 
is 
still 

embroiled in a competition with 

Lavigne and LaFontaine for 
the lion’s share of minutes in 
net, he has tried 
to mentor both 
freshmen 
this 

year. 
Berenson 

says the senior 
has 
been 
very 

supportive 
and 

positive, 
even 

while 
helping 

players 
who 

could take his 
job.

Nagelvoort 

has 
tried 
to 

lead in the way that former 

goaltender Luke Dwyer did 
during his time in Ann Arbor. 

Dwyer 
was 
a 

walk-on 
who 

hardly 
played, 

but 
someone 

who, 
according 

to 
Nagelvoort, 

“worked 
his 

butt 
off” 
and 

prepared as if he 
was going to start 
every Friday and 
Saturday night.

The difference 

is, 
Nagelvoort 

wasn’t 
a 
walk-on. 
He 
was 

recruited 
by 
Berenson 
and 

the coaching staff, and when 
Michigan comes calling for 
a 
player, 
it 
usually 
means 

they have the talent to start. 
Nagelvoort showed he did in his 
first season.

But his career hasn’t panned 

out as he might have expected.

He is still in the thick of 

the goalie battle, especially 
considering 
his 
performance 

last Friday, when he made 31 
saves and helped his team earn a 
4-1 win over the Sun Devils.

All 
three 
goalies 
have 

been 
impressive 
this 
year, 

but Berenson has yet to see 
one 
distance 
himself 
from 

the others. But with the way 
Nagelvoort 
performed 
in 

Arizona, 
Berenson 
said 
the 

senior is back in the picture.

“Right now, our concern is 

Friday night against (Boston 
University),” Nagelvoort said. 
“Looking any further past that 
— there’s no need. I can’t play 
Saturday’s game right now. What 
I can do right now is I can focus 
on today’s practice. Looking 
any further ahead than that is a 
waste of time, because you don’t 
know what’s going to happen.”

Wolverines keep homecourt edge

Taking down a top Big Ten 

tennis player is an impressive 
feat for anyone, but especially so 
for a freshman. And on Sunday, 
Michigan 
freshman 
Connor 

Johnston showed age wasn’t the 
number that mattered when he 
defeated Minnesota junior Felix 
Corwin, 6-3, 2-6 and 6-1.

“(Johnston) just got here two 

months ago,” said Michigan 
coach 
Adam 
Steinberg. 
“To 

have a win like that was pretty 
impressive.”

Johnston earned his big win at 

the Gopher Invitational, where the 
Michigan men’s tennis team went 
out with a bang in its final weekend 
of fall competition. Minnesota 
hosted four Wolverines who made 
the trip, along with Boise State, 
Dartmouth, Drake, Notre Dame, 

Pennsylvania and Wichita State.

Michigan had a strong presence 

on both the singles and doubles 
courts over the course of play, 
going 
11-for-16 
and 
5-for-8, 

respectively.

The 
doubles 
combinations 

were steady for the weekend, with 
junior pair Davis Crocker and Alex 
Knight playing together, while 
Johnston combined with junior 
Carter Lin. Johnston and Lin both 
had standout weekends, making 
it all the way to the doubles final 
on day three against Minnesota, 
but falling in a close 6-4 match. 
Johnston was the only Wolverine 
to go undefeated for singles 
matches.

In the first day of competition, 

the Wolverines swept doubles 
play. Crocker and Knight squared 
off against the Quakers, while 
Johnston and Lin faced the 
Broncos. Michigan then matched 

up against its same opponents for 
singles and went 3-for-4, with all 
three wins in straight-sets. 

Day 2 saw more mixed results, 

as the Wolverines faced the 
Golden Gophers, the Big Green 
and the Fighting Irish. The team 
demonstrated 
2-for-2 
doubles 

domination, but Knight, Crocker 
and Lin each picked up a loss 
in singles. Crocker’s match was 
particularly close, as he took it 
to a third set, which ended 6-2 in 
Minnesota’s favor.

Michigan 
finished 
off 

strong in the final day of the 
invitational against Minnesota 
and Pennsylvania. Crocker and 
Knight defeated the Quakers once 
again, 6-3, and Johnston and Lin 
competed in the doubles final. 
The team cleaned up singles with 
another 3-for-4 record.

In 
addition 
to 
the 
many 

successes in Minneapolis this 

weekend, senior doubles duo 
Jathan Malik and Kevin Wong 
reached the semifinals in the ITA 
National Indoor Intercollegiate 
Championships. After winning 
three straight three-set matches in 
the doubles main draw, the two fell 
to Wake Forest in a hard-fought 
three-set match.

The Wolverines’ performances 

at both the Gopher Invitational 
and 
the 
National 
Indoor 

Championships bode very well 
for the team as it looks to the 
winter season, which will kick off 
in January. The team’s full roster 
from last year is returning, in 
combination with strong additions 
like Johnston.

“We have a lot of momentum 

going into January, and we have 
the next two months to prepare,” 
Steinberg said. “(We) will do 
everything we can to get ready for 
a great year.” 

‘U’ research could 
create UTI vaccine

For the first time in scientific 

history, a team of University 
of Michigan Medical School 
researchers have found a way to 
prevent urinary tract infections 
in mice — a breakthrough 
which could have significant 
implications for UTI treatment 
in the future.

UTIs are a common infection 

that traditionally occur when 
bacteria enter and infect the 
urinary tract, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. Women and 
girls tend to be at a higher 
risk for getting a UTI than 
men. According to the CDC, 
half of all women experience 
a symptomatic UTI in their 
lifetime, though sexual activity, 
pregnancy and age also increase 
susceptibility.

Typically, 
UTIs 
are 

treated 
with 
antibiotics. 

However, through use of a 
trial vaccination which uses 
the same molecules that UTI 
bacteria are normally attracted 
to, researchers have been able to 
track how uropathogenic E.coli, 
which causes a majority of the 
infections, 
become 
resistant 

to traditional UTI antibiotics. 
The research, conducted by 
Henry Mobley — senior author 
of the paper and chair of the 
Department of Microbiology 
and 
Immunology 
— 
along 

with Laura Mike, research 
fellow, and other researchers, 
could potentially lead to a 
new treatment method. The 
research was funded by the 
National Institute of Health 
as well as a research scholars 
fellowship from the American 
Urological Association.

Published Monday in the 

Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, Mike said 
researchers feel this discovery 

of the use of the molecules — 
formally called siderophores 
— can provide protection from 
UTIs. This research goes in 
conjunction with their previous 
work, which used proteins from 
the 
bacteria 
in 
vaccination 

efforts.

Researchers first tested the 

use of siderophore vaccination 
by applying the bacteria inside 
the noses of test mice over a 
three week period. Once the 
mouse 
developed 
immunity, 

they 
applied 
the 
bacteria 

directly to the mouse bladders, 
as UTIs first develop in the 
bladder and kidneys. 

When treated with each 

siderophore 
individually, 

there were moderate results 
for 
protection 
against 
UTI 

development. 
However, 

according to the paper, with 
the 
administration 
of 
both 

siderophores and the carrier 
protein, there were much more 
noticeable results.

Mike said the researchers 

had 
also 
identified 
protein 

receptors on the surface of the 
bacteria prior to testing the 
vaccination.

“What those receptors are 

doing, 
though, 
are 
taking 

the small molecules that are 
stealing iron from us during the 
infection so the bacteria can 
have iron, and so we wondered 
if we could actually use those 
small molecules instead of just 
the protein and get protection 
in our mouse model as well,” 
Mike said.

Though the method is not yet 

ready for humans, Mike said 
the research shows promise for 
human UTI treatment.

“This is a starting point to 

then go forward in terms of 
future vaccine development, 
so we were really excited to at 
least some protection in the 
urinary tract,” Mike said.

‘M’ closes out fall season at Gopher Invitational

It happens the same way every 

set. Before set point, the crowd 
rises to its feet and begins a 
steadily increasing clap. The small 
but enthusiastic student section 
holds up a single finger, with only 
one point necessary to win the set. 

Saturday night, a “Go Blue” 

chant mixed into the mayhem, 
before 
a 
rousing 
rendition 

of 
“The 
Victors” 
celebrated 

Northwestern’s 
spike 
landing 

wide of the boundaries and a 
third-set victory. 

A sold-out Cliff Keen arena had 

come to life.

At the beginning of the season, 

the Michigan women’s volleyball 
team (9-5 Big Ten, 20-6 overall) 
set a goal not to lose at home. If 
not for two hard-fought losses 
against top-ranked teams in the 
country, the Wolverines might 
be on their way to doing just that, 
after notching a 3-1 victory over 
Northwestern on Saturday.

On Oct. 18, Michigan came 

two points shy in the fifth set 

from 
knocking 
off 
then-No. 

1 Wisconsin (20-3) at home, 
just weeks after falling to No. 1 
Nebraska (21-1). Aside from those 
matchups, the Wolverines remain 
unscathed at home, providing a 
significant advantage in what is 
widely regarded as the strongest 
conference in the country.

“We want to defend our house, 

and a big part of that is the energy 
we get from the crowd and student 
section,” 
said 
junior 
middle 

blocker Claire Kieffer-Wright. “I 
think the crowd really gives us 
energy.”

In the first meeting between the 

teams, Michigan cruised to a 3-0 
victory, without much adversity. 
Saturday, though, the Wolverines 
would 
need 
the 
home-court 

advantage from a fifth straight 
sellout crowd.

After cruising to a 25-17 victory 

in the first set, Michigan struggled 
to contain Northwestern’s attack, 
led by outside hitter Symone 
Abbott, in a second-set loss. “In 
the first two sets, we just were 
kinda flat, from the court and the 
bench,” Kieffer-Wright said. “And 

both are equally important to our 
success.”

But behind a lively, post-football 

crowd, the Wolverines regained 
momentum — as Michigan head 
coach Mark Rosen describes, “the 
pressure gradient” of the game 
pushed in its favor. They won 
four of the first five points of the 
all-important third set and forced 
a Northwestern timeout. They 
would not relinquish that lead en 
route to a 25-19 third-set victory.

For senior middle blocker Abby 

Cole, the advantage comes down 
to representing the school well.

“First of all, it’s a pride thing,” 

she said. “We let people come into 
our house, and we need to protect 
our house. Definitely, when you’re 
playing with the block ‘M’ on your 
jersey, it does come down to a 
pride thing. It’s really important 
we don’t let them take that away 
from us.”

Saturday, it was clear the crowd 

didn’t want that advantage to be 
taken from them either.

Hill, defense make ‘M’ dominant in Red Zone

The Michigan football team 

reaches the red zone, and redshirt 
junior fullback Khalid Hill smiles. 
He knows his job is coming up.

The Wolverines have plenty of 

big-play threats designed to put 
the offense in position to score 
touchdowns. They only have 
one, for the most part, designed 
to punch the ball in the end 
zone once they come close. That 
player is Hill, and he relishes his 
role.

A month ago, Hill made 

headlines by giving himself the 
nickname 
“The 
Hammering 

Panda.” Now, he has started to go 
by the moniker “the vulture,” too. 
Perhaps his uniqueness merits 
more than one label.

Hill’s role as the goal-line 

specialist has continued, and his 
numbers have only become more 
lopsided. He has carried the ball 
21 times this year and not lost 
yards on any of them. He has 
scored on nine of those rushes, 
tying for 36th in the country in 
touchdowns. But he has gained 
just 34 yards total, ranking ninth 
on the team and tying for 735th 
in the country. His longest carry 
went for four yards.

As many times as Hill has 

gone in for a fullback dive at 
the one-yard line, Michigan’s 
opponents cannot seem to stop 
it. The offensive line gets a push, 
redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight hands him the 
ball and Hill lunges over the goal 
line. His teammates have started 
to notice.

“In the huddle, hearing the 

guys talking to me and stuff like 
that, just being like, ‘Khalid, 
let’s get it,’ ” Hill said. “It’s good 
to hear the guys trusting me, 
trusting me to get the job done. 
I appreciate those guys for that.”

Hill’s ability to score from short 

yardage is a significant asset for 
the Wolverines — because it’s no 
easy task, as Michigan’s defense 
has proven. Of all the statistical 

mismatches the Wolverines own 
this season, red-zone efficiency 
may be the most staggering.

Led by Hill, Michigan’s offense 

has ventured into the red zone 
54 times and scored 49 times, 39 
touchdowns and 10 field goals, for 
an average of 5.63 points per trip.

“I think it’s just the mentality,” 

Hill said. “Our mentality is, when 
we get in the red zone, let’s score. 
Let’s finish it off. What’s the point 
of going through all that on a 
70-yard drive or 60-yard drive 
and we get to the red zone and 
get stopped? It’s pointless. You 
wasted your time. You wasted all 
that breath, that hard work for 
nothing.”

Michigan’s 
opponents, 

meanwhile, have reached the 
red zone just 14 times in nine 
games. And on those series, the 
Wolverines’ defense has allowed 
points on just eight (including 
three of six against Michigan 
State) for a total of 47 points, 3.36 

per trip.

In a close game, that makes a 

big difference. In East Lansing, 
for example, both teams drove 
into the red zone six times, but 
Michigan outscored Michigan 
State by 10 in those situations — 
and won the game by nine.

Saturday was another glaring 

instance. The Wolverines twice 
allowed Maryland to reach their 
1-yard line but didn’t allow points 
either time. On the first occasion, 
the Terrapins moved backward 
from there and then missed a field 
goal, and on the second, redshirt 
junior linebacker ran down a 
receiver and stopped him a yard 
shy of the goal line just as the first 
half ended.

“And not allowing them to be 

in until they’re in, I think that’s 
a great quality of a defense,” 
Harbaugh said. “They hit a long 
screen play, and it was down 
inside the 20, the 15, the 10, the 5 
and then we make the tackle on 

the 2- or 3-yard line. They’re not 
in until they’re in. That mentality, 
playing on their side of the line 
of scrimmage, with multiple, 
double-digit tackles for loss.”

The 
defense’s 
strength 
in 

holding its own goal line dates 
back to last year, when the unit 
was similarly dominant in those 
situations. Former coordinator 
DJ Durkin often talked about 
just needing a “place to stand” 
and making use of it, and the 
Wolverines have done so again.

Harbaugh mentioned that in 

general, conversion rates in the 
red zone are lower than anywhere 
else on the field, because teams 
often dig in and stack the box like 
Michigan does. No team has been 
as stifling as the Wolverines in 
those situations, though.

“It’s a tough thing to do as an 

offense, to score from inside the 
5-yard line,” Harbaugh said. “So 
there’s that, and you know, just 
get ’em down. They’re not in until 

they’re in, and you don’t give in.”

Michigan’s offense, though, 

does not have the same problem. 
The Wolverines are tied for 15th 
in the country at converting red-
zone chances into touchdowns, 
because even if they can’t score 
on a big play, they have Hill as a 
second option.

Saturday against Maryland, 

freshman running back Chris 
Evans took a screen pass 56 
yards and nearly scored, but after 
review, the officials called him 
down at the 1-yard line, giving 
Hill another opportunity to finish 
the job. That and other similar 
occasions throughout the year 
have opened “the vulture” up to 
some good-natured ribbing.

“Everybody kind of gets on me 

about that,” Hill said, then added 
with a smile, “People call me the 
vulture because I always get the 
touchdown, but it’s not my fault 
— you should have got in the end 
zone.”

Harbaugh visits 
Obama’s speech

When 
President 
Barack 

Obama arrived in Ann Arbor to 
speak to roughly 9,000 attendees 
Monday, Michigan made sure 
he was greeted by an important 
campus figure. Obama was in 
town as part of a get-out-the vote 
effort on behalf of Democratic 
Presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton on the eve of Election 
Day, and according to the White 
House Press Office, Michigan 
football coach Jim Harbaugh 
was there to welcome Obama to 
the University.

Though most students had 

to wait in a line that wrapped 
around the University’s athletic 
campus to hear Obama speak at 
Ray Fisher Stadium, Harbaugh 
and Athletic Director Warde 
Manuel arrived just before 
Obama did and were given 
two seats in prime view of the 
President.

Harbaugh may have had the 

best seat in the house, but his 
son, James, wasn’t as lucky. On 
the Inside Michigan Football 
Radio Show Monday night, 

Harbaugh said James — a 
student at the University — got 
in line at 5:30 a.m. in order to see 
the president speak after getting 
a ticket yesterday.

“You’ve got to think a student 

that attends a speech of the 
President of the United States 
— the leader of the free world 
— that’s something that’s going 
to be a signature moment in 
their educational experience 
at the University of Michigan 
and in their college career,” 
Harbaugh said, noting that fifth-
year senior wide receiver Jehu 
Chesson was also in attendance.

Harbaugh 
found 
it 
neat 

that 
Obama 
was 
speaking 

“literally 
feet, 
yards” 
from 

where the Wolverines practice 
at Schembechler Hall. Though 
he didn’t give away his own 
Election Day plans, he did 
mention that it would be fifth-
year senior wide receiver Amara 
Darboh’s 
first 
opportunity 

to vote after receiving his 
citizenship just last year.

“That’s 
as 
good 
as 
it 

gets,” Harbaugh said. “It’s a 
tremendous thing. Living the 
American Dream.”

‘M’ makes NCAA Tournament

“Relieved” was the word that 

Michigan women’s soccer coach 
Greg Ryan and senior forward 
Nicky Waldeck used to describe 
the Wolverines’ first selection 
to the NCAA Tournament since 
2013.

Michigan (10-5-4) was picked 

for the 64-team field announced 
by 
the 
selection 
committee 

Monday afternoon and will host 
Illinois State in the first-round of 
the championship Saturday night.

“I was definitely relieved — 

we were pretty nervous all day,” 
Waldeck said. “When we saw our 
name, we just jumped up.”

The Wolverines are 44th in 

Rating Percentage Index, with 
two wins and a tie against top-
25 teams, including a victory 
over then-19th-ranked Rutgers. 
But even with a respectable 
resume, Ryan wasn’t certain his 
team would be given an at-large 
selection after two consecutive 

years of missing the cut.

“Based on the last two years, 

I was really nervous going into 
the selection,” Ryan said. “We’ve 
watched that show in the same 
position as we were this year in 
terms of the RPI numbers, so it 
was nice to see our players finally 
getting rewarded for a great 
season.”

Illinois State, the winner of the 

Missouri Valley Conference, owns 
an RPI of 144, a 14-5-1 record and 
a seven-game winning streak 
heading into its match against the 
Wolverines. The two first-round 
foes shared a common opponent 
in this year in now-No. 10 Notre 
Dame, to which the Red Birds 
fell after Michigan handed the 
Fighting Irish a resounding 2-0 
loss a week prior.

For the Wolverine seniors, led 

by Waldeck and defender Anna 
Sorccorsi, the matchup will give 
the group another opportunity to 
take the field with one another.

“All 
the 
seniors 
watched 

(the selection show) together,” 

Waldeck said. “We’re just really 
happy to get a chance to play with 
our best friends and enjoy the time 
we have left together.”

This 
marks 
the 
second 

appearance for the class of 2017 in 
the NCAA Tournament — the first 
of which resulted in a magnificent 
run to the quarterfinals in 2013 
and included a victory over Illinois 
State in the second round.

“(The selection) is just fantastic 

for this group of seniors,” Ryan 
said. “It’s fantastic for (the seniors) 
to be rewarded, especially after 
the last couple years of seemingly 
doing everything to get into the 
NCAA Tournament, and then not 
quite getting there. So for us, it 
couldn’t be better than this.”

As the Wolverines make their 

fourth 
postseason 
appearance 

under 
Ryan 
with 
another 

opportunity to play at U-M Soccer 
Stadium, it’s safe to say that 
Monday was a welcomed change 
from years prior. It certainly 
brought a sense of relief for Ryan 
and his team.
