CAMPUS-WIDE SMOKING BAN
At SACUA,
Warner says
'U' set to go
'cold turkey'

Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs Ora Pescovitz sits for a photo in her office earlier this month. Pescovitz oversees the entire University Health System
and says that she aims to make it the best in the country.
For Pescovitz a mission to heal

Editor's Note: Today, the Daily
is previewing a new continuing
series entitled "Executive Conver-
sations," a set of features based
on extended sit-down interviews
with some of the University's most
influential officials. These conver-
sations will give readers an inside
look at the personalities and lives
of those in the University's highest
offices, who make decisions that
impact the experiences of everyone
on campus.
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
Tucked away on the seventh
floor of the Medical Science I
Building, the University's Execu-

tive Vice President for Medical
Affairs Ora Pescovitz has truly
made her office a reflectionof who
she is.
There aren't any degrees or cer-
tificates on her walls and most of
the awards she has won sit silently
in a file cabinet in a nearby closet.
However, there is one award that
receives much more attention. It
is an award so meaningful that
Pescovitz keeps it directly behind
her computer, just an arm's reach
away.
However, the award itself isn't
anything spectacular. With a bro-
ken base, it can't even stand up
properly. And so it sits on the win-
dowsill, going unnoticed by most,
despite its large inscription.

Given to her when she received
a named department chair in
1998, the award is made complete-
ly of glass with one simple mes-
sage on the large vertical panel:
"Tikkun Olam."
The Jewish principle basi-
cally means to repair or mend
the world, Pescovitz explains as
she holds up the broken base and
inscription. And it's a principle
that Pescovitz says "is applicable
to everything we do."
"I think people have to go about
their work with a sense of purpose
and I want people to have that
feeling that we're here to make a
contribution," Pescovitz explains.
"In some way, you have to feel
that your job is to help make the

world a better place," Pescovitz
adds. "It doesn't have to be the
same way that I think you have
to do it, but you have to feel that.
Finding that is important."
And Ora Pescovitz has certain-
ly found that.
SHAKING THINGS UP: AN
AMBITIOUS GOAL
Responsible for approximately
20,000 employees and a $1.9 bil-
lion annual operating budget, it's
no understatement that Pescovitz
is one of the most powerfulpeople
at the University and has nearly
unrestricted authority over the

School of Public
Health dean tells
faculty smoking ban
plans are on track
By ANNIE GORDON THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
At yesterday's meeting of the
Senate Advisory Committee on
UniversityAffairs, Kenneth War-
ner, dean of the School of Public
Health, updated faculty members
on the progress of the Smoke Free
University initiative, which is on
track to become effective on July
1, 2011.
University officials, including
University President Mary Sue
Colman announced the initiative
one-year ago today after Chief
Health Officer Robert Winfield,
spent a year researching and
speakingto students. Warner told
the faculty governing body that
the decision to make the campus
smoke-free fits with the Univer-
sity's goals of creating a healthier
community.
"The decision was made
because it aligns perfectly with
the goals of MHealthy, which
focuses on improving the health
of the University community and

indeed to be a healthy commu-
nity," Warner said.
Those involved in planning the
initiative are currently discussing
how to implement it next sum-
mer. Warner said he hopes rec-
ommendations can be submitted
to University officials by this fall.
The planning has involved
the creation of sub-committees,
sending surveys to the campus
community and getting input
from community members, War-
ner said.
"The sub-committees are con-
sidering implications for student
life, human resources, grounds
and facilities and visitors to the
University," Warner said.
He added that those involved
in the project are also tryingto be
sensitive to smokers as well as the
surrounding community.
Warner described the Univer-
sity's plan as going "cold turkey,"
saying that once the plan is in
effect there will not be any "butt
huts" around campusto easepeo-
ple into the change.
Since smoking will not be a
ticketed offense by the Depart-
ment of Public Safety or other law
enforcement officers, University
officials are expectingthe rule to
be self-enforced.
Warner added that at other

doors of its eaerynear campus.
Nico Leo, co-owner of the Swirl-
berry location, said the Swirlberry
branch located at 209 State St.
closed to make way for CVS phar-
macy, which will occupy both the
building that Swirlberry was in as
well as the neighboring building
previously occupied by Sava's State

"CVS is coming in and they are

week.
Swirlberry moved to State Street,

across from Starbucks and the cur-
rent location of Sava's, last May,
shortlybeforeYogoBliss announced

And while the closing may have
come as a surprise to some students
on campus, Leo said he was aware of
CVS's planned move to State Street
before he moved to the location.
"We knew about the CVS com-

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
While students are gone over
the summer, University officials

will be busy working to imple-
ment several changes that will
have major implications for stu-
dents when they return to cam-
pus next fall.
The changes, which often
receive little attention from stu-
dents away from campus over the
summer, include routine items
like reviewing tuition and hous-
ing rates. However, this summer,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman will be also be dealing

with issues specific to this year
including considering several
changes to the Student Statement
of Rights and Responsibilities
and implementing a continuous
enrollment policy for all Ph.D.
students and candidates.
And that's all before Univer-
sity officials appear before the
NCAA's Committee on Infrac-
tions in August as part of the
NCAA's ongoing investigation

Teaching intwo languages

For Associate Prof. Lawrence
LaFountain-Stokes, using both Eng-
lish and Spanish in his classes is not
just part of his job - it's part of who
he is.
Born and raised in San Juan, Puer-
to Rico, LaFountain-Stokes grew up
with an English-speaking father and
a mother who spoke both English
and Spanish. LaFountain-Stokes
was raised using both languages and
he attended bilingual schools for
twelve years.
LaFountain-Stokes has taught at
the University since 2003. He holds
a joint appointment in the Latino
Studies, American Culture and
Spanish departments and he said his
work in these departments allows
him to incorporate both English and
Spanish into his teaching.
"Teaching in Spanish is a very
integral part of what I do," LaFoun-
tain-Stokes said. "If I don't teach in
Spanish I get depressed because I

really enjoy the language."
The courses he has taught at the
University cover a variety of top-
ics including LGBT studies, queer
Hispanic culture and Latino and
Caribbean literature, theater, perfor-
mance and film.
The controversial nature of some
of LaFountain-Stokes' courses, like
those on LGBT issues and feminism,
can make teaching more challeng-
ing, but he said it also makes his job
more interesting.
"It makes it more satisfying for me
to be able to talk about socially com-
plex issues in the classroom," he said.
Before coming to the University,
LaFountain-Stokes attended Har-
vard University. During his time
there he studied abroad at the Uni-
versity of Sao Paulo in Brazil where
he lived for a year and half. He said
his time away from Harvard "put
things into perspective."
"Living abroad was much more

challenging." LaFountain-Stokes
said. "Going to a private school in the
U.S. where the library had books and
there weren't strikes, and where you
could walk to class and there was no
hyper-inflation, it made it very easy."
Following his studies in Cam-
bridge and Sao Paulo, LaFountain-
Stokes went on to earn Master's and
Doctorate degrees in Spanish from
Columbia University in New York.
After his time at Columbia,
LaFountain-Stokes began teach-
ing at Ohio State University where
he worked as an assistant professor.
from1998to 1999. He then went on to
teach at Rutgers from 1999 to 2003.
In addition to his work in the class-
room, LaFountain-Stokes is also the
author of Queer Ricans: Cultures and
Sexualities in the Diaspora, as well
as a recipient of numerous awards
and scholastic fellowships including
the Woodrow Wilson Award.

Mistrial declared in
transgender beating
A federal judge in Memphis has
declared a mistrial for a former
police officer charged with beating
a transgender prisoner.
The mistrial was declared yes-
terday after jurors began deliber-
ating last Wednesday in the case
against Bridges McRae. He was
accused of violating the civil rights
of Duanna Johnson, a biological
male who lived as a woman.
Johnson was repeatedly hit in
the face with handcuffs as she was
being booked into jail on a prosti-
tution charge in February 2008.
McRae testified Johnson pushed
and scratched him and he was try-
ing to control her.
The 43-year-old Johnson was
shot to death later in 2008 on a
street corner near her home. No one
has been arrested.
Prosecutors say they plan to
charge McRae again. He will stay
free on his current bond.

GM to announce
early repayment of
federal loans
A person briefed on the matter
says General Motors Co. CEO Ed
Whitacre will announce tomor-
row that the company will repay its
remaining $4.7 billion in U.S. gov-
ernment loans earlier than expect-
ed.
The person says Whitacre will
make the announcement at the GM
assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan-
sas. Then he will head for Washing-
ton, D.C. to meet with government
officials. The person did not want
to be identified because the details
have not been announced.
GM said during its fourth-quar-
ter earnings announcement on
April 7 that it planned to repay the
money by June, five years ahead of
schedule.

Priest detained for
molestation of boys
Police detained an 83-year-old
Brazilian priest after a congressio-
nal hearing produced allegations
he molested boys as young as 12 and
" a television station displayed a sex
tape of him in bed with a 19-year-
old.
The pedophilia allegations
against Msgr. Luiz Marques Bar-
bosa are the most lurid of several
sexual scandals to hit the Brazilian
church recently, largely because of
the videotape that has been widely
distributed over the Internet.
Sen. Magno Malta, the lawmak-
er leading the legislature's sexual
abuse probe, said that the deten-
tion late Sunday of Barbosa was
a milestone in the fight against
child abuse in Brazil. He said the
investigation is not an attack on
the church, but at suspected child
molesters.
Judge Romulo Vasconcelos, who
participated in the congressional

probe, told Globo TV on Monday
that he requested Barbosa's imme-
diate detention out of fear that the
priest would flee the country.
PHOENIX
Arizona passes bill
to crack down on
immigration
Arizona lawmakers approved
a sweeping immigration bill yes-
terday intended to ramp up law
enforcement efforts even as crit-
ics complained it could lead to
racial profiling and other abuse.
The state Senate voted 17-11
nearly along party lines to send
the bill to Gov. Jan Brewer, who
has not taken a position on the
measure championed by fellow
Republicans. The House approved
the bill April 13.
"This bill goes a long way to
bringing law and order to the
state," said Sen. Al Melvin, R-Tuc-
son, who cited costly services pro-
vided to illegal immigrants and
the recent slaying of a southeast-
ern Arizona near the U.S.-Mexico
* border as reasons for the move.
The new measure would be
the latest crackdown in Arizona,
which has an estimated 460,000
illegal immigrants and is the
nation's busiest border crossing
point.
Arizona enacted a law in 2005
making human smuggling a state
crime and prohibited employers
from knowingly hiring illegal
immigrants with a law in 2007.

From Page lA
into allegations of wrongdoing by
Michigan's football program.
First on the agenda for Coleman
will be reviewing the proposed
revisions to the Statement of Stu-
dent Rights and Responsibilities.
Coleman is set to make the final rul-
inglaterthis month on whether five
proposed amendments will be put
into effect for the next academic
year.
The proposed changes include
changing language in the student
code to make it gender neutral,
realigning the statement's current
nondiscrimination policy to match
that of the University's Board of
Regents and adding intimate part-
ner violence as a violation of the
code.
A controversial amendment
proposal that would have lowered
the burden of evidence needed to
convict a student of code violations
from clear and convincing evidence
to a preponderance of the evidence
standard will likely not be imple-
mented, after the Michigan Student
Assembly withdrew its support for
the proposal earlier this year.
However, in an interview with
The Michigan Daily last month,
Coleman said she couldn't rule the
proposed amendment out, say-
ing she wasn't familiar with what
would happen in that situation.
"I can't comment on them
because I really don't know yet
what they're going to be moving
forward," Coleman said in March,
addingshe didn'tknow whetherthe
burden of evidence proposal would
be considered. "I don't know. I
mean, I assume notifit'sabeen with-
drawn, but as I've said I haven't got-
ten anything yet so I don't know.
In June, Coleman will be leav-
ing the country on a trip to China.
During her visit, Coleman will be
makingseveral stops, including one
at Shanghai Jiao Tong University -
the school with whom the Univer-
sity has a joint institute - and at the
world expo.
"I'm very much looking forward
to that trip because I'm hoping that
we'll be solidifying this research
relationship we have with Shanghai
Jiao Tong," Coleman said last month.
At the same time, University offi-
cials, including outgoing Provost
Teresa Sullivan and incoming Pro-
vost Philip Hanlon, will continue to
work on finalizing the University's
budget for next year.
The finalized budget proposal
will be presented to the University's
Board of Regents in June for a vote.
In recent years, the regents have
typically unanimously approved
the budget proposal. However, last
year when a 5.6 percent tuition

up for us and we didn't really have
to invest heavily in the location."
Leo added that when the busi-
ness first came to State Street
in the spring, it did very well
and profits were high - in part
because of the minimal start-up
costs.
"We had a really good summer,
an amazing summer actually. But
then when school started, we saw
that sales were going down," Leo
said. "This was partly due to the
weather and partly due to several
other frozen yogurt places com-

ing up in the area."
Leo explained that Swirlber-
ry's "superior product" also made
it difficult to survive in the
Ann Arbor Fro-Yo market.
"Most of our products we
make ourselves or get from local
Michigan dairies, so we have to
charge a bit more for it and that
didn't sit well with the student
population," he said.
And with such a competi-
tive market, Leo said he doesn't
think Swirlberry will re-open
near campus again.
"State Street is a very lovely
place, but it is very competitive"
Leo said. "I don't think we'll
consider a location on campus
again. Sava's was lucky enough
to find a place across the street
that suited (its) needs. We

increase was proposed, Regent
Julia Darlow (D-Ann Arbor) and
Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bingham
Farms) voted against the budget
proposal, which still passed with a
majority of votes.
University officials have
remained silent on how much
tuition might increase next year,
but have hinted that a tuition
increase is very likely.
In an interview after testifying
before the State Senate Subcom-
mittee on Higher Education last
month, Coleman said both cost cut-
ting and revenue enhancements
were beingconsidered.
"It'll be a combination I think of
looking at tuition revenue, looking
at alternative offerings we could
have in the spring and the sum-
mer," Coleman said of the revenue
enhancement options.
Aggressive cost cutting mea-
sures have been a staple on campus
in recent years and Coleman has
said she expects $22 million to be
trimmed for next year. However,
the number pales in comparison to
the up to $68 million less in state
appropriations that both Coleman
and Sullivan have said the Univer-
sity may face.
Adding to an already busy sum-
mer, University officials are also set
to appear before the NCAA's Com-
mittee on Infractions in August as
part of the ongoing NCAA probe
into allegations that the Michigan
football team violated association
rules.
In February, the University was
presented with a list of five specific
charges, which included allegations
that the University exceeded the
number of allowable practice hours,
allowed staff to conduct and moni-
tor off-season workouts and that
head coach Rich Rodriguez created
an atmosphere of non-compliance.
Another controversial topic on
the agenda for both University
regents and administrators is the
implementation of a continuous
enrollment policy at the Rackham
School of Graduate Studies.
The policy would mandate that
all Ph.D. students and candidates
enroll in all fall and winter semes-
ters from matriculation to degree
completion. officials, including
Rackham Dean Janet Weiss con-
tend most students will notice little
or no change because of the policy.
However, the policy has drawn
a great deal of criticism from some
Ph.D. students and candidates and
from faculty members - including
several who serve on the Senate
Advisory Committee on University
Affairs, the leading faculty gover-
nance body.
Despite the opposition, the poli-
cy is set to be implemented next fall
if the University's Board of Regents
approves a decrease to the Rack-
looked and couldn't really find
anything that was appropriate."
But despite the struggle of
owning a business on State Street,
Leo said he still believes the area
has a lot of potential.
"I think the CVS will do really
well in that location," he said. "It
has good traffic flow and espe-
cially when the construction (on
North Quad) is done, it will be
really well-suited to the needs of
the students."
David Curtis, a sales associate
at Collier's International, said
Swirlberry's challenges at the
location aren't unusual for the
area. Collier's listed both the for-

mer Shaman Drum building and
the storefront previously occu-
pied by Ritz camera.
Curtis added that the number

ham Graduate tuition rates - a
move administrators say is essen-
tial to make such a policy work.
However, according to Sullivan,
the regents will not vote on the rest
of the policy, as the tuition com-
ponent is the only component that
requires regential approval.
University officials and regents
will also continue to evaluate the
current endowment spending rule
over the summer, with rumors cir-
culating that they may decrease the
annual payout.
Such a decrease could come
amidst an already strained bud-
get. However, officials - including
Coleman and Timothy Slottow, the
University's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer -
have said the University needs to
consider both present and future
needs.
The review of the payout is
required by a motion passed by the
regents in 2006 to change the way
in which the University calculates
the endowment's value. Coleman
and Slottowhave both stressed that
no decisions have been made yet
and that an increase or decrease to
the spending policy are both pos-
sible.
Finally, University officials will
await a confirmation of reaccredi-
tation from the Higher Learning
Commission this summer. The
nod does not have a specified time
of release, but the University has
already completed the entire pro-
cess, and only need a final ruling
from the HLC.
In an interview last month, Sulli-
van said the University had already
reviewed a copy of a draft report
from the HLC site visit and evalu-
ation committee, which was to be
sent to the HLC's board. After the
board meets later this year, they
will issue their final ruling.
While on site, the HLC site visit
committee reported they were
pleased with the University's per-
formance and indicated they would
recommend to the HLC that the
University be reaccredited. How-
ever, the HLC maintained one
"reservation" in the area of the
University's commitment to diver-
sity - calling on the University to
strengthen its efforts.
In last month's interview, Sulli-
van called the reservation a sign of
the HLC's wish that the University
continue to fight the ban on affir-
mative action.
"(Fernandez Calistino) wanted
to be on record that our accrediting
body wants us to be diverse, so that
when the University gets sued the
next time, we're able to say 'Even
our accrediting body thinks that
diversity is one of our strengths,' "
Sullivan said of HLC site visit com-
mittee chairman's comments on
diversity.
of empty storefronts isn't "higher
than usual."
"It's tough for businesses to
find a spot, especially when you're
leasing a space that is largely
dependent on students," he said.
"So when they're gone for the
summer, the businesses go down.
So unless they can take the hit
that summer gives and provide
services that are good all year
round, it is hard for them to sur-
vive."
Curtis said though Swirlber-
ry's challenges weren't out of the
ordinary businesses in the area
are impacted by the difficulties of
the area in different ways.

"You get food places that are
doing really well there, so it
depends on what you're dealing
with," she said.

Iraqi court
orders vote
recount in
electio0n

Prime Minister's
bloc claimed
election fraud
BAGHDAD (AP) - An Iraqi
court yesterday ordered a recount
of more than 2.5 million votes cast
in Baghdad during the March 7
parliamentary election, a decision
that could tilt the results in favor
of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki
and inflame sectarian tensions
after what has already been a con-
tentious election.
Al-Maliki's bloc won 89 of par-
liament's 325 seats, putting him
just two seats behind former Prime
Minister Ayad Allawi. Neither
has been able to cobble together
a majority coalition with the sup-
port of other parties yet. In the
meantime, al-Maliki has been try-
ing to alter the outcome through
court appeals and other challeng-
es, and by trying to woo support
away from Allawi.
Al-Maliki's State of Law bloc
has claimed election fraud and
demanded a recount in five prov-
inces, including Baghdad, which
accounts for almost a fifth of par-
liamentary seats.
The recount was ordered by a
three-member court that investi-
gates election-related complaints
and will be carried out by Iraq's
Independent High Electoral Com-
mission, said commission official
Hamdia al-Hussain.
She said the election commis-
sion has so far only received the
court's decision on Baghdad and
has not received any decisions
about the other provinces. She said
the electoral commission would
decide how and when the recount
would be carried out.
The complete election results
were released by the election com-
mission on March 26 but were
immediately challenged by al-

The fire department has yet to

injuring two others - was inten-

Maliki's State of Law coalition,
which claimed the vote was beset
by fraud and irregularities.
The decision to recount the
Baghdad ballots could signifi-
cantly lengthen the time it takes to
seat the next government, raising
questions about the country's sta-
bility as political factions battle for
supremacy.
Iraq's minority Sunni com-
munity, which saw its once domi-
nant position under Saddam
Hussein destroyed under the
majority Shiite government that
came into power after the 2003
U.S.-led invasion, was jubilant
after Allawi's I----+raqiya came up
with a two-seat edge over State of
Law.
Allawi, who like al-Maliki is
Shiite, included Sunni candidates
in his election list and attracted
significant support from that com-
munity. Any perception that they
have been robbed of their votes
could have potentially violent
repercussions in a country still
reeling from years of sectarian vio-
lence.
During anews conference Mon-
day, al-Maliki said the recount
could alter the election results.
"We will all abide by the results
of the recount. But I can say that
it is possible for the results to be
changed after the recounting," the
prime minister said.
The United Nations, the Arab
League and U.S. officials have all
praised the election, saying it was
fair and legitimate.
A spokeswoman for Iraqiya
questioned the decision to hold a
recount.
"We need to make sure that no
one, neither the State of Law nor
anyone else, will take seats they do
not deserve. As long as the proce-
dure will be handled in a transpar-
ent way, we will have no worries
or concerns," said Maysoun Dam-

told AnnArbor.com. "Of particular
importance is the recent fire that

According to an April 7 article
published in The Michigan Daily,
the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment is already treating that fire as
arson and considers it linked to the
car fires, an AAPD sergeant who
requested to remain anonymous
told the Daily atthe time.
"Given what you can surmise
from what happened (April 3), I
would say any reasonable person
could deduce what caused the
fires," the sergeant told the Daily at
the time. "As far as we're looking at
it, it wasn't an accident."

'09-'10 Edgar Awards
These awards only cost $9,000 of students' money
Back when J. Edgar Hoover, that infallible defender of our
constitutional rights, was playing dictator and spying on
Americans as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Daily's editorial page handed out the Edgar Awards annually
to individuals and institutions best embodying his many admi-
rable characteristics. Of necessity, we revived the tradition in
recent years.

ith Michigan's gubernato-
rial race heating up and
an utterly substandard
pool of candidates
to choose from, I
felt like utilizing
this opportunity to
interject four sug-
gested economic
reforms our next
governor should
tackle following
the November
election. ALEX
1. End the I
MEDC. BILES
The Michigan-
Economic Devel-
opment Corporation has epitomized
government mismanagement over
the last decade. The MEDC utilizes
money gathered from taxpayers and
redistributes it through targeted tax
breaks given to Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm and her buddies' favorite com-
panies under the guise of promoting
job growth. This "picking winners
and losers" mentality is the worst
type of central economic planning.
An incident in March exemplified
the failure when the MEDC gave
$9.1 million in tax breaks to Richard
Short, a convicted embezzler whose
company address was located in a
trailer park. Pictured shaking hands
and smiling with Granholm, Short
was arrested the next day on counts
of a parole violation and failure to pay
restitution for previous charges.
The Mackinac Center for Public
Policy found that for every 100 jobs
the government promised through
the MEDC since 1995, only 29 ever
arrived. And Michigan continues to
lead the nation in unemployment at
14.1 percent, according to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's time
to recognize the MEDC's failures
and abolish an organization that's
robbing Michigan taxpayers, espe-
cially when funds could be allocated
toward more worthwhile causes.
2. Introduce HSAs.
Republican Indiana Governor
Mitch Daniels penned an excellent
Mar. 1 piece in the Wall Street Jour-
nal describing the process of allowing
state employees to opt out of Indi-

ana's public insurance plan in favor
of health savings accounts (HSAs).
Under Indiana's HSA plan, $2,750 is
deposited into each state employee's
account for health expenditures,
with the state covering the plan's
premium. The goal was to incentivize
participants to spend money wisely,
make better health decisions and
help Indiana's budget in the process.
HSAs were a tough sell under
Daniels' first year as governor
five years ago - only 4 percent of
employees opted out of public insur-
ance in favor of HSAs. Today, over
70 percent of Indiana's 30,000 state
employees utilize HSAs. Their satis-
faction with HSAs is extremely high
- only 3 percent have returned to
their public provider. In 2010 alone,
Indiana will save over $20 million
exclusively due to the HSA option
and the state's total costs will be
reduced by 11 percent.
Facing one of the most constrained
budgets in the nation, perhaps it's
time Michigan considered embrac-
ing a similar health care plan that
expands choice and lowers costs
without compromising quality.
3. Legalize it.
Legalizing growth, possession
and sale of marijuana in Michigan
and modestly taxing it would bring
much-needed revenue to a state
whose ailing budget is hemorrhaging
green. Beyond the social freedom and
potentially increased tourism that
legalization would bring, the eco-
nomic benefits of marijuana legaliza-
tion are patent.
4. Stop stupid projects.
Under President Barack Obama's
stimulus plan, $244 million was
allocated to construct a high-speed
rail line between Detroit and Chi-
cago. Some think new trains will
help the economy by providing an
enhanced means of travel and the
impetus for increased development.
Unfortunately, this notion is rooted
in the imagination of naive individu-
als lacking any trace of practical-
ity - people who envision oodles of
Michiganders crowding lines, eager-
ly awaiting rides in sleek trains from
Pontiac to Gary.
This concept could work if any-

body you knew rode trains on a regu-
lar basis to begin with. But in 2009
alone, Amtrak lost over $22 million
operating trains in Michigan. Under
the proposal, Michigan has agreed to
cover any losses from the high-speed
initiative. To cover these potential
loses, the state will either raise taxes
or cut budgets for other programs
like education.
A one-way ticket from New York
to Washington on the high-speed
Amtrak Acela starts at $133 and this
is a subsidized rate. For lower-class
individuals to afford these trains
even larger subsidies would have to
be enacted, again begging the ques-
tion of how many tax increases or
budget cuts Michigan will have to
make.
Michigan's next
governor should
heed this advice.
Advocates argue trains will
enhance travel between downtowns,
but fewer than 8 percent of Ameri-
cans work in major city downtowns
and these individuals tend to be
bankers, government workers and
lawyers. It shouldn't be the state of
Michigan's priority to subsidize the
travel of wealthy individuals.
The state of Michigan should scrap
the misguided fantasy of high-speed
rail that's destined for financial ruin
and instead utilize tax dollars for
essential government services.
The recommendations I've made
are practical, and politically feasi-
ble, whether it's Indiana's successful
introduction of HSAs or marijuana
legalization that's receiving serious
consideration in California. But as
a disclaimer to the dedicated Alex
Biles fan club: I have no intention of
running for office in the conceivable
future.

The Michigan Student Assembly passed a resolution
last week supporting Teach For America in its bid to
retain federal funding. TFA has relied on federal fund-
ing for years, and this money plays an instrumental role
in the organization's ability to recruit new teachers and
serve America's underperforming school districts. This
is a crucial time for TFA as it considers the prospect of
expanding to cities like Detroit and Seattle next year.
Since its inception, over 24,000 individuals have
participated in Teach For America impacting the lives
of over 3 million students nationwide. Currently, some
7,300 corps members teach in 35 regions, both urban and
rural. In 2010, more than 46,000 applicants applied for
this fall's class of 4,350 teacher corps members. Here at
the University, 461 seniors applied - an astounding 7.4
percent of the senior class. For the past four years, the
University has been the nation's largest contributor to
TFA's teacher corps.
In America, education is supposed to be the great
equalizer and the primary vehicle for upward mobil-
ity. But all too often, birthplace determines a student's
educational prospects. Across the country, the 14 million
children living in poverty have academic setbacks and,
therefore, life prospects that are dramatically different
than those of their peers in wealthier communities. Chil-
dren living in low-income communities are already two
to three grades behind their higher-income peers by the
time they reach fourth grade. About 50 percent of stu-
dents in low-income communities will not graduate from
high school by the age of 18. Only one in 10 students from
low-income communities graduate from college.
Teach For America is working to end this national
inequity and close the achievement gap. After recruiting
some of America's brightest into its teacher corps, TFA
intensively trains these individuals over the summer and
places them in America's poorest school systems. There,
they teach classes, mentor students, and provide hope for
school districts that badly need attention.

But Teach For America's work is in jeopardy. A new
congressional proposal would eliminate TFA's federal
funding for 2011-2012. For years, TFA has relied on fed-
eral funding to continue its programs and outreach to
America's poorest communities. Losing this support
would seriously inhibit the organization from its long-
term goal of ending education inequity across America.
This year, TFA requested $50 million from Congress
to meet increasing demand among college students
and communities. Without this funding, TFA would be
unable to hire more than 1,350 teachers who would teach
86,000 students in the coming school year. Losing this
funding would severely limit the ability of TFA to recruit
potentially qualified applicants at the University and
other schools. It could also prevent TFA from expanding
to Detroit, a city in desperate need of education reform.
But you can help save TFA.
First, contact your U.S. senators and representatives
in Washington and urge them to support federal funding
for TFA. Call the offices of U.S. Senators Carl Levin and
Debbie Stabenow. Visit TFA's website at http://teachfo-
ramerica.org/federalfunding. There you can send letters
and e-mails to your representatives in Washington urg-
ing them to support TFA.
Most importantly, educate yourself on the work of TFA
and the ways you can get involved. Learn about their pro-
grams, meet with their on-campus representatives, attend
information sessions and consider TFA after graduation.
Talk to friends who are or will be in the program next year.
Learn about their experiences and understand the impact
of their work on thousands of children nationwide.
As the largest contributor to TFA's teacher corps, the
University community must defend this organization
accordingly. Teach For America needs our help - let's
join them in their fight.

and "Highway to Hell" by AC/
DC. They went all-out with the
theme, and it won't be the last
time a gimmick dictates the
musical content of the show.
The Madonna episode is air-
ing tonight, and after the "Hell-
o" episode I have to say I'm not
looking forward to it - at all.
Don't get me wrong, I'm as big
of a gleek as anyone, but only
when "Glee" isn't serving as a
happy-go-lucky music video.
First and foremost it should
remain a TV show, but lately
that doesn't seem to be the case.
"Glee" succeeds when it creates
a compelling story and inserts
appropriate music around it.
There are so many characters
with interesting backgrounds
and points of view and when the
song-and-dance numbers are
used to highlight this, it's some-
thing special.
But as evidenced by last week's
"Hell-O" and what we've seen
so far of the Madonna episode,
"Glee" hasn't been working
around the story or characters,
the characters and story work
around the music. I'm sure the
numbers will be great, but nar-
ratively, how is an episode cen-
tered on Madonna going to make
sense? Why would the manly Sue

PESCOVITZ
From Page 1A
System.
In the chain of command, Pesco-
vitz ranks at the same level as the
University's Provost Teresa Sul-
livan and the University's Chief
Financial Officer Timothy Slottow
- all three of whom report directly
to University President Mary Sue
Coleman.
And though she's been in her
post for less than a year, having
joined the University last May,
Pescovitz has big plans to make the
University's Health System the best
in the nation.
Raising the bar at a health system
already recognized as one of the top
15 in the nation is obviously a tall
order. Despite the daunting nature
of this challenge, its something that
Pescovitz says she's determined to
do.
"I'm too young and too ener-
getic - not that young to you - to
come to a place like this in a job like
this to be a caretaker," Pescovitz
explained. "It's a great place and I
came because it was a great place,
but I didn't come to keep it static."
Through a series of strategic
planning meetings with many of
her direct reports, Pescovitz has
refined her vision.
"I am the kind of person who
always seeks to raise the bar and
I always like to look for the next
challenge for the institution, so I
have set a challenge for the health
system," Pescovitz said.
Specifically, Pescovitz is deter-
mined to make the University
Health System the bestinthe nation
in four categories - health, health
care reform, biomedical innovation
and the educational quality provid-
ed by the Medical School and the
School of Nursing.
But such far-reaching cultural
changes to an organization with
20,000 employees can't be made
overnight or by one person, which
is why Pescovitz said she's spread-
ing her message to all of the people
in the Health System community.
"They're galvanized around a
common goal," Pescovitz said.
And in order for the goal to be
reached, employees at all levels
from custodians to doctors will
have to buy into the plan and will
need to understand what they can
do to move the organization for-
ward.
"It doesn't matter what they're
job is, but if they see their purpose
... they understand why they're,
here," Pescovitz said.
It's also a message that Pesco-
vitz indicated was being received

well by many working within the
Health System. Pescovitz recalled a
conversation she had with a house-
keeper at the C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital earlier last year.
"(The housekeeper) said 'I'm
here to make the children better.' I
said, 'How are you here to make the
children better?,' " Pescovitz said,
retelling the story. "(The house-
keeper replied) 'I'm here to make
them healthy.' She was cleaning the
floors, but she understood that her
purpose was to make the children
healthy and by keeping the floors
clean, her purpose was to make the
children healthy."
And ensuring employees under-
stand their impact on the organi-
zation is something that Pescovitz
said she believes will help to drive
each person to better results and
help to move the organization fur-
ther toward the top of the rankings.
"If you can give them that sense
of purpose and they understand
their purpose and they understand
where they fit in the organization
and they feel that sense of pur-
pose, well that's my job asa leader,"
Pescovitz said. "You don't tell them
what they have to do everyday. If
they see the purpose of the organi-
zation, they know whatthey have to
do if they understand where they fit
within the organization."
A PASSION FOR PATIENTS
Finding her own place within
the organization is something that
Pescovitz has had to adjust to.
When she made the move to the
University last year, she left behind
one of her most valued constituen-
cies - her patients.
But despite the fact that Pesco-
vitz is no longer able to take time
out to see patients, she keeps
reminders of past patients sprin-
kled throughout her office to help
her keep things in perspective.
While pointing out pictures of
her family near her desk, Pescovitz
pauses and picks up a book sitting
on a nearby coffee table.
"This book was given to me by
two sisters," Pescovitz says. "They
were wonderful patients."
Pescovitz pauses, looking at a
greeting card tucked inside the
front cover. She reads silently
before turning and reading part of
the message out loud.
"'We are forever grateful,' "
Pescovitzsaysreadingfrom the card.
Her hand clenches to her chest
as tears well up in her eyes and her
breath becomes heavier.
"You're going to make me cry,"
Pescovitz says as she puts down
the book and reaches for a box of
Kleenex nearby.

"I gave up seeing patients when
I came here," Pescovitz explains,
saying it was one of the most dif-
ficult parts of her transition to the
University.
A DIFFERENT TYPE
OF LEADER
Though Pescovitz is a pediatric
endocrinologist by trade, talking
with her isn't anything like having
a conversation with a highly spe-
cialized doctor or researcher.
Forget the technical jargon that
many doctors may use to explain
the complicated procedures they're
conducting or the mumbo jumbo
a researcher may use to describe
their methodology. When Pesco-
vitz talks with someone, she seems
to resemble a motivational speaker
more than a pediatric endocrinolo-
gist or hospital executive.
Pescovitz's style of speech is fit-
ting for someone who views her
role at UMHS as someone who can
rally employees to work toward
common goals and as someone who
is responsible for acting in a ser-
vant-leadership capacity.
It's a quality that translates into
what Pescovitz calls her four D's
of e-mail - deal with, delegate,
delay or delete. But no matter what
the decision is, when Pescovitz
receives an e-mail, she guaran-
tees a response - one within 24
hours nonetheless - to anyone who
e-mails her.
"I feel that no matter who con-
tacts me, no matter who it is, they
deserve a response," Pescovitz said.
"So whether it is a regent or it is a
student or whether it is a house-
keeper, I respond the same way to
everyone."
It's a belief that Pescovitz says
comes from her view on service
to people and her opinion that
the Health System and Univer-
sity "should provide a service that
exceeds expectations."
"That's a form of service excel-
lence and it is part of our mission.
It's part of how we differentiate
ourselves from our competitors,"
Pescovitz explained.
However, the belief that every-
one deserves a timely response has
earned her "a serious reputation for
the BlackBerry" and caused Pesco-
vitz to describe herself as a "rapid-
fire responder."
"It goes off all the time," Pesco-
vitz said during the interview as
her BlackBerry vibrated with each
e-mail arriving in her inbox.
And her prompt, frequent and
often odd-hour responses are some-
thing that she says have turned
more than a few co-workers' heads.
"I have a personal style that

differs from my predecessor and
everyone around here is very
aware of that," Pescovitz said with
a laugh. "It's caused a little stress
in here. It's definitely a change -
shaken people up a little bit."
"I'm known to send messages
in the middle of the night, I have
a reputation for that," Pescovitz
explained.
And responses in the middle of
the night aren't at all uncommon
with Pescovitz's intense schedule.
Another thing that separates
Pescovitz from most executives is
her belief in how employees should
be managed - not by high-level
supervisors, but by their peers and
by themselves.
"They have expertise that I don't
have," Pescovitz explained. "Con-
tracting - I don't know anything
about contracting, but the guy in
contracting reports to me."
Pescovitz went on to explain the
only employees she feels qualified
to evaluate is one of her peers with-
in her specialty.
"The only person that could
report to me where I could evalu-
ate what they do is another pediat-
ric endocrinologist," she said. "But
there are 20,000 people here who at
some level report to me. How can I
evaluate them? I can't."
Her belief that someone with-
in the field needs to evaluate an
employee to truly understand their
work has led Pescovitz to imple-
ment a different system - one in
which she reviews the results and
not necessarily the actual work.
"I have to be respectful of the
fact that they know stuff that I
don't know. So I'm not really able
to assess their work, except I can
assess the product at the end of
the day," Pescovitz said. "I have to
assume we've hired people who are
really great at what they do, but I
can see when they get off track and
they do other stuff."
MEETINGS, MEETINGS AND
MORE MEETINGS
Up at 4 a.m. each morning,
Pescovitz is the epitome of a morn-
ing person. She starts each day
with a big breakfast and a vigorous
workout routine, arriving to her
office by 6:30 a.m.
"I'm usually in here no later than
6:30 in the morning," Pescovitz said
in an interview in her office. '
But for Pescovitz, being the first
to arrive in her seventh-floor suite
- walking in the door so early that
she usually turns on the lights - is
more of a necessity than a choice.
"I don't want (everyone) to come
in at 6:30," Pescovitz said. "I'm
happy they're not here, because

that is the only time that I have to
do the little bit of stuff that I have
to do by myself."
And once normal business hours
roll around, Pescovitz barely has
any time to do any of her own work
- like responding to e-mails or
reading reports - because she's in
meetings for most of the day, every-
day.
"Once 8 o'clock starts, and some-
times my meetings actually start at
7:00, I do not have another break
the rest of the day," Pescovitz said.
"It's packed for the rest of the day,
including most days through din-
ner meetings."
They may be long workdays, but
Pescovitz says she loves her work
enough to compensate for the hec-
tic schedule.
"I have long days, because I enjoy
my work. That is the truth and I
would tell you, and this is an impor-
tant message for students, that
you must find work that you love,"
Pescovitz said. "If you find work
that you're passionate about, then
you will want to work long hours.
My vocation is my avocation. For
that, I feel really fortunate."
FINDING TIME FOR FAMILY
Despite her intense work sched-
ule, Pescovitz says she is proud
that she is able to strike a balance
between her work life and her per-
sonal life.
"We have three children," she
said, pointing to a set of pictures
on the windowsill next to her desk.
"I do want to make sure students
know this, because (family) is an
important thing."
With an enormousgrin and ener-
gy beaming from her eyes - a com-
mon expression she exhibits when
talking about either her family or
her work - Pescovitz describes
what each of her children are doing.
And while her children are grown
up now, Pescovitz said she still keeps
in close contact with them.
But despite the fact that she's far
away from her children and her hus-
band, who hasn't made the move to
Michigan yet, Pescovitz said she's
comfortable being in Ann Arbor-
alone - at least for the time being.
"My husband is still in Indianap-
olis. One of the reasons I'm not that
sorry that he's still there is because
I'm still learning my job," Pesco-
vitz explained in her interview last
fall. "I would love him to come here
and then I will cut back a little bit,
because it would be nice tobe mar-
ried; tomorrow is our 30th wedding
anniversary."
In addition to spending her free
time, albeit somewhat limited, with
her family, Pescovitz also has some

personal hobbies - including apas-
sion for playing the piano.
In fact, before deciding to go to
medical school, Pescovitz consid-
ered becoming a concert pianist.
"I didn't think I was good
enough. I thought it would be too
hard," Pescovitz said. "I thought
being a pianistwas way harder than
becoming a physician, which it is."
And though she ultimately
became a pediatric endocrinologist
instead, Pescovitz stillhas a passion
for the piano. Her favorite piece,
she said, is Chopin's "Ballade No. 1
in G Minor" - though she claims
she can't play it very well.
In addition to her love of piano,
Pescovitz also has a love of art. It's
a passion she shares with her hus-
band and it's one she is able to com-
bine with her job, by incorporating
some of her favorite pieces into her
office.
Though her office consists of pri-
marily windows on two walls and
several doors and bookshelves on
the other two walls, Pescovitz finds
a way to integrate her art collection
into her office by using what little
wall space she has for her art and by
spreading her personal collection
throughout the hallways closest to
her office.
It's a collection that Pescovitz
classifies simply as "eclectic" -
with everything fromlandscapes to
contemporary pieces.
On a tour of the artwork, Pesco-
vitz pauses in front of a painting
hanging in a short, private corridor
between her office and her confer-
ence room. She turns and begins
to explain why the piece - The
Death of Narcissus - is hanging in
a hallway that people rarely walks
through.
"It's not in the right place. We
have an art consultant who said I
shouldn't have this too publicly dis-
played because it's a naked body,"
Pescovitz says. "But the truth is
there are naked art sculptures
around here. You know, we are a
liberal place."
But the painting hangs discreetly
in the private passageway because
it doesn't serve a public purpose.
Pescovitz says she uses the painting
as a source of strength, especially
when dealing with challenging fac-
ulty members.
"I bought this so I could be
reminded of what happens to Nar-
cissus, and we have some faculty
for whom this is really applicable,"
Pescovitz says with a laugh. "Every
once in a while we have a faculty
member who's kind of a little too
full of himself or herself and when
I need strength to deal with them,
I can remember what happened to
Narcissus in the end."

places where smoking bans have
been implemented there has been
a compliance rate of about 97 per-
cent. Currently, two other Big Ten
Schools, Indiana University and
The University of Iowa have smoke-
free campuses as well as more than
250 other schools around the coun-
try.
For students interested in quit-

ting smoking, Warner said sub-
sidized behavioral counseling as
well as prescriptions for smoking-
sensation medicine will become
available.
In addition to trying to be sen-
sitive to smoking members of the
University community, Warner
said the committees are also try-
ing to address the issue of location
equality for people who smoke on
both North and Central Campus.
On Central Campus, there is
a mixture between city-owned

and University-owned sidewalks,
which will mean that once the ban
takes effect it will be relatively
easy for smokers to find property
owned by the city on which to
smoke. However, on North Cam-
pus, the University owns most of
the sidewalks, and the planners
want to provide an equal amount
of space to smoke on both cam-
puses.
Committee members are also
looking into creating an exception
to the ban for smoking near the Big

House during tailgates on Football
Saturdays, Warner said. The cur-
rent policy allows alcohol in this
area only on Football Saturdays and
the plan is to also allow smoking in
those situations.
But beginning this year, Warner
said smoking will be banned in all
areas inside the stadium. Previous-
ly, it was allowed in areas outside
the stands.
"If you are going to have excep-
tions and violations I expect to see
a lot more of them there than any-

where else," Warner said, citing a
reason for this as the influx of non-
University affiliated people to the
area.
Another issue that may present
itself is that those people with pre-
scriptions to smoke medical mari-
juana will need somewhere to do
so.
"My answer to that is they can
eat brownies," Warner joked. Add-
ing more seriously that they could
smoke in an off-campus location.
Warner also said that while some

people oppose the smoke-free mea-
sure, he didn't see too many people
voicing their opposition at the
informational meetings held by the
University on the topic.
Warner added that the results of
the survey meant to gauge student
opinion by gathering responses
from about 1,500 students and
also suggested that the ban wasn't
polarizing.
"I wouldn't say that it was on
one side or the other, a little bit of
everything," Warner said.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Alumni weigh inon this year's team

ESPN analyst Howard
and Super Bowl
winner Woodley see
good things for 'M'
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
Fielding Yost's pride still drips
off of the Michigan football pro-
gram as if he was coaching the
team.
It's that confidence that made
Yost so legendary and the play-
ers who step foot in the Big House
each and every year, especially the
former ones, carry a least a little
bit of the swagger that Yost had.
It's no differentnow, despite the
Wolverines' 8-16 record through
coach Rich Rodriguez's first two
years.
Former Michigan All-American
defensive end LaMarr Woodley,
who was in town for the spring
game festivities, certainly has a
little bit of Yost's fire in his veins.
"Not to lose at all," Woodley
said of his expectations for next
year. "That's reasonable for me,
not to lose at all. I hate to say,
'Oh, yeah we're going to lose, it's
going to be 11-1.' No, go all the
way. That's always my thing, take
one game at a time and you can do
that."
When Woodley was pursuing
quarterbacks in the Big House
from 2003-2006, Michigan was
37-13 in his four years.
Other former Michigan play-
ers have voiced their displeasure
with Rodriguez recently, Dhani
Jones spoke out and so did Amani
Toomer.
To Woodley, the slow start
was almost expected. But now, in
Rodriguez's third year, he's leav-
ing less room for excuses.
"I tell everybody, the year Jake
Long left, we lost everybody on
offense," Woodley said. "I mean
all the weapons, all the top guys,

we lost everybody. So when he
came in with his new offense, he
didn't really have anything. Now
he has the opportunity to turn
that around and he's getting the
guys he needs in the right spots
and things will change up."
The offense was a strong suit
for the Wolverines last season,
and Michigan would be forced
into shootouts, trying to score as
much as possible to stay in game.
"They know they have to get
improved," Desmond Howard, a
former Heisman Trophy winner
at Michigan and current ESPN
college football analyst, said of the
defense.
And from his point of view, as

In the spring game, Robin-
son played primarily with what
could be considered the first-team
offense against the second-team
defense, while Forcier played with
the second-team offense against
the first-team defense. Robinson
was the quarterback receiving the
hype this spring, despite the fact
that Forcier started every game in
2009.
Howard said he wasn't one to
make predictions on Michigan's
2010 season in April - there are
more than four months until
Michigan's first game against
Connecticut.
Though wins and losses aren't
official until the fall, Rodriguez

can build towards success by
building on experience, like Sat-
urday's spring game.
The Wolverines are certainly
working to improve all over the
field, not just at the quarterback
position. And Howard knows
Rodriguez isn't the only coach
feeling the pressure to win this
fall.
"Nick Saban's trying to make
progress, and he just won a
national championship," Howard
said. "That's just the nature of the
sport, and I think that's the honest
answer. You can't rest when you
won, and you can't rest when you
haven't won big yet. ... Each coach
wants to get better."

The Michigan Daily would like to thank and congratulate those
graduating seniors that made the paper everyone loves possible.
Some devoted 4 years, some 3, and others only a year, but they all
combined to make the Michigan Daily a success.

Going into the fourth inning
of Saturday's game, the Michigan
softball team held an 8-0 lead over
Northwestern.
For college softball teams around
the country, eight is the magic
number - it's the amount of runs
needed to end a game after the fifth
inning as part of softball's eight-run
mercy rule.
But then, something rare
occurred. The Wildcats clawed
back into the game to force a full
seven inning - just the third time
for the Wolverines since the begin-
ning of Big Ten play more than
three weeks ago.
But after holding off Northwest-
ern's comeback attempt, Michi-
gan trotted out again the next day,
whipping the Wildcats into submis-
sion with a 15-0 victory that was
finalized in the top of the fifth.
It's something Michigan has done
time and time again this season.
For most, including the players,
the eight-run rule has been a blessing.
"That's not frustrating at all - we
want to be done," senior third base-
man Maggie Viefhaus said on April
11th after the team's weekend series
against Minnesota, in which both
games ended in early Wolverine vic-

tories. "We are never going to give
up, we are going to keep hitting and
keep scoring runs until that game is
over. And if it's overearly, good."
During Michigan's current
12-game winning streak, the Wol-
verines have ended games in the
fifth inning a total of eight times.
The potent combination of domi-
nant pitching and timely hitting has
allowed the team to finish games
early in six of its nine conference
games.
In Michigan's matchup against
Central Michigan last Wednesday,
the Wolverines went into the fifth
up just 2-0 and six shy of reaching
the magic eight run lead. Follow-
ing a quick scoring barrage, senior
Molly Bausher smacked a hit into
center field, driving two runs across
and effectively sealingthe game.
"I looked at the scoreboard and
was like, 'It's the fifth inning. If we
score six runs here, the game will
be over, and that would be sweet,'
" Bausher said after the game. "We
did, and I didn't even expect that to
happen but it happened."
Bausher conceded that the team
was at least in partmotivatedto end
games early because it leaves play-
ers more time for other things.
"You got school, finals," she joked.
Though a number of the advan-
tages are obvious, the rule certainly

has its detractors - and one needs
to look no further than Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins.
"Sm one of the advocates to
have it removed or changed to a
15-run limit," Hutchins said. "In
what other sport do you stop play-
ing because you're ahead? Eight
runs isn't out of reach. You lose the
opportunity to give some younger
kids playing time. I don't think it's
good for softball, and I don't think
it's good for the season-ticket hold-
ers that have to rush out to the field
before the game is stopped."
In the 15-run win against North-
western on Sunday, Hutchins was
able to switch up the defensive
rotation a bit and allow those who
don't normally play to get some
experience. Freshman Ashley Lane
also saw a rare plate appearance in
the fourth inning, and though she
struck out swinging, on a team with
six seniors as everyday starters, any
time in the spotlight can be valu-
able. And without a mercy rule, that
time would grow.
"It's a rule that was put in place
in the 1970s when I played, when
the average pitcher had a 0.2 ERA
and games were being won 1-0,"
Hutchins said. "Back then if a team
got up by eight runs then there was
no way there would be a comeback.
That's not the case anymore."

Stu ent films in a
festival of lig ts

Forgoing party-friendly hits,
MGMT crafts daring album

By ANDREW LAPIN
Senior Arts Writer
After almost a year of work,
Josh Amir has a pretty good idea
of what message
he wants people Ughtwods
to take from his
film. Saturday
"What the and Sunday
essence of the at 6 p.m.
film (is) about is Natural Science
doing something Audiotrium
you actually care
about doing,
and not doing something because
you're making X amount of dollars,
or because there are certain pres-
sures, but actually finding what
it is that means something to you
and then just devoting your time
to doing it," said Amir, LSA senior.
Amir is talking about his
Screen Arts & Cultures Honors
thesis project, "The Saxophone
Player," an 18-minute short about
an unemployed automotive work-
er in Detroit who finds solace in
jazz music. But he might as well
be talking about the mindset of
the student filmmaker. The Uni-
versity's SAC department is full
of creative, ambitious talents just
like Amir, all of whom devote
countless hours in their produc-
tion classes to crafting films that
mean something to them.
This weekend, while the rest of
campus frantically crams for its
remaining finals, all of these SAC
students will be crammed into
the Natural Science Auditorium,
jubilantly celebrating the fruits
of their labors with the one thing
all aspiring filmmakers crave: an
audience.
The Lightworks Festival is a
two-night event held at the end of
every semester by Michigan's Film
and Video Student Association
(FVSA) to give every student in an
SAC production class the chance to
share their work with friends, fam-
ily and fellow craftspeople. LSA

The Brooklyn duo
reacts to fame with
'Congratulations'
By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Music Editor
Fame is a funny thing. For some
artists, a life in the limelight is a
one-way ticket
to self-parody,
coupled with
a complacent MGMT
retreat into the
ranks of the jet Congratulations
set. For others, Columbia
fame is a wak-
ing nightmare,
disaffecting and strange.
Congratulations - a record
made in reaction to the sudden, if
not disorienting, rise to fame duo
Ben Goldwasser and Andrew Van-
Wyngarden enjoyed off the back
of 2008's Oracular Spectacular -
shows MGMT falling somewhere
in the middle, its love-hate rela-
tionship with fame not without a
fair dose of alienation.
To say these guys felt pressure
in making the album would be an
understatement. For VanWyngar-
den, the thought of descending into
artistic irrelevance was enough to
trigger panic attacks. And in an
attempt to thwart what might have
been expected by the mainstream,
the group opted to risk estranging
the majority of its fanbase with an
artier, more patient affair. They
wanted to make the "right" album.
But at what point does principle
take precedence over.art?
Expanding upon the more
experimental, texture-driven
second side of their debut, the
group enlisted Peter Kember (bet-
ter known as Sonic Boom and
an ex-member of space-rock act
Spacemen 3) to produce anthe-
mic psychedelia in the vein of The
Flaming Lips or The Arcade Fire.
The result is a skyward extrapola-
tion of British invasion pop akin
to The Kinks and The Zombies,
eschewing the jagged, io-fi guitars
that defined the genre in favor of

The new Nickelodeon cartoon looks trippy, brahh.

dense, layered synths and walls of
reverb-soaked vocals.
Between the Scooby Doo-esque
farfisa organs, snappy backup
vocals, references to British pop
musicians and a left-field 12-min-
ute epic ("Siberian Breaks"), it's
clear the band wishes to be viewed
as an art-rock outfit and not just
a one-trick pop machine. And
while much of the experimenta-
tion works, it often feels claustro-
phobic, leaving something to be
desired.
Encapsulating the band's feel-
ings toward the polarizing effects
of fame, the title track is an enjoy-
able tropical hangover with a
breezy synth sporadically con-
necting the dots between chord
changes. Acting as a sort of sequel
to lead single "Flash Delirium," it
makes for one of the most satisfy-
ing moments on the album.
"I Found A Whistle" is remi-
niscent of Lips's more wistful,
star-gazing ballads, with shiny,
churning keyboards surrounding
VanWyngarden's yearning vocals.
"Brian Eno" is a frenetic paean to
the legendary Talking Heads col-

laborator and ambient musician,
complete with quirky organs and
enough blips and bloops to warrant
the track's namesake.
Affirming VanWyngarden's
pleas to experience the album as
a whole, Congratulations success-
fully captures an aesthetic that
remains consistent, if not extreme-
ly compelling, throughout. But
looking at the tracks independently
offers a different story: Each offers
enough willful weirdness that the
album more often than not collaps-
es under its own weight.
To be clear, this is not an album
of singles like "Kids" or "Time to
Pretend." If anything, Congratula-
tions shows a clear - and, at times,
misguided - attempt to staytrue to
MGMT's artistic roots, pop ambi-
tions be damned. But that's not to
say the album wouldn't have ben-
efited from another "Electric Feel."
Goldwasser and VanWyngar-
den seem to know lightning rarely
strikes twice, and only time will
tell whether Congratulations will
ultimately deliver the group to
where it would like to be. But for
now, it seems like the right move.

Whether you're finishing your first term or looking
forward to graduation, summer sessions at the
University of Pittsburgh provide an exciting
opportunity to catch up on needed credits, stay
on track, or get ahead of schedule.
With more than 500 courses offered throughout
the 4-week, 6-week, 12-week, and 14-week

at the times that fit around your busy schedule.

Michigan to become
third state to ban
race-based
admissions policies
By WALTER NOWINSKI
Daily StaffReporter
Nov. 8, 2006 - Michigan voters
dealt a firm blow to the Universi-
ty's affirmative action programs
yesterday, voting decisively in
favor of Proposal 2, which bans
the consideration of race, gen-
der or national origin in college
admissions, hiring and contract-
ing.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, a vocal opponent of the

proposal, reaffirmed the Uni-
versity's commitment to diver-
sity late last night in a statement
released before the election was
called.
"We defended affirmative
action all the way to the Supreme
Court because diversity is essen-
tial to our mission as educators,"
Coleman said. "Regardless of
what happens with Proposal 2,
the University of Michigan will
remain fully and completely com-
mitted to diversity."
LSA junior Ryan Fantuzzi, co-
chair of the Washtenaw County
Michigan Civil Rights Initiative,
the group that campaigned for
the amendment, said he was
overjoyed at the proposal's pas-
sage.
"It is like Christmas," Fan-

tuzzi said. "The government
can't discriminate against people
anymore - and that is a beautiful
thing."
Not all students were quite so
jubilant at the news.
LSA junior Rachel Tanner, who
campaigned against Proposal 2
with Students Supporting Affir-
mative Action, resigned herself to
defeat last night.
"We did a great job on campus,"
Tanner said. "But ultimately the
lies and deceptions prevailed."
While Michigan voters
approved Proposal 2 by a 16-per-
cent margin, University students
voted decisively against the
amendment. In predominantly
student precincts around campus,
Proposal 2 failed 75 to 21 percent.
The amendment to the state

Constitution will go into effect
sometime in late December,
depending on the day that the
Secretary of State certifies the
election results.
Unless a judge delays the
implementation of the amend-
ment, the University will be
forced to change its admissions
policies halfway through this
year's admissions cycle.
Marvin Krislov, the Univer-
sity's general counsel, confirmed
last week that the University may
request a stay to delay the imple-
mentation of the amendment.
In the coming weeks, Univer-
sity administrators will have to
review admissions, hiring and
outreach programs to ensure that
they are in compliance with the
new law.

'U' officials stand
behind Rodriguez,
accused of violating
five NCAA rules
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
Feb. 23, 2010 - The Michigan
football program has committed
five violations of NCAA rules and
regulations, according to a notice
of allegations the University
received from the NCAA yester-
day. The findings are the outcome
of a four-month investigation by
the NCAA into the University's
Athletic Department.
The University will formally
respond to the allegations, which
were announced by school officials
at a news conference yesterday
afternoon, in the next 90 days. The
University will also appear before
the NCAA's Committee on Infrac-
tions in August.
The notice of allegations asserts
that the University violated NCAA
regulations in five main areas.
First, the notice says that the Uni-
versity's football program broke
NCAA rules that limit the num-
ber of coaches that may work with
student-athletes. The notice states
that five quality control officers -
staff members who are not techni-
cally coaches, but work with the
football team - illegally engaged
in coaching activities.
The NCAA also alleges that
the University violated regula-
tions that prohibit staff mem-
bers from monitoring football
players in voluntary, off-season
workouts and conditioning -
two activities that the athletic
department is also accused of
having exceeded time restric-
tions on.
Both of those potential viola-
tions first surfaced in a Detroit
Free Press article that was pub-
lished in late August. Inthewake
of that report, the NCAA and the
University both launched inde-
pendent investigations into the
matter.
The notice of allegations -
the culmination of the NCAA's
investigation - also specifi-
cally called out Michigan foot-
ball coach Rich Rodriguez for
acting in a manner that "failed
to promote an atmosphere of
compliance within the football
program" and for failing to suf-
ficiently monitor the activities of
his program with regard to the
other allegations.
The athletic department is
similarly charged with not prop-
erly overseeing the activities
of the football program with

regard to the allegations.
Alex Herron, a graduate assis-
tant football coach, is accused of
providing NCAA investigators
with misleading, and at times, false
information about his role in the
situation.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, Rodriguez and incoming
Athletic Director David Brandon
announced the notice of allega-
tions at the press conference yes-
terday afternoon.
Coleman began the briefing by
saying that the University "has
been cooperating with the NCAA
in its investigation of our football
program."
"Intercollegiate athletics is a
fundamental feature of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, and we take pride
in the integrity of our athletics
program," Coleman said. "We also
take full responsibility for knowing
and following NCAA rules and thus
view the allegations seriously."
Coleman added that she and
other University officials are
"addressing concerns, quickly and
head on."
"All of us - Coach Rodriguez,
David Brandon and I - are
deeply committed to compli- -
ance with NCAA rules and the
future of our football program,"
she said.
Brandon announced the
notice of allegations from the
NCAA during the press confer-
ence. Brandon said the NCAA
brought allegations of wrong-
doing in the number of hours

student-athletes spent practicing
and violated rules governing what
activities could be attended by
quality control staff.
"We clearly made mistakes in
those areas, and we have already
taken actionto prevent any ofthose
mistakes from being repeated,"
Brandon said.
Brandon then went on to pro-
vide what he described as a
"top-level perspective" of the alle-
gations.
"In some out-of-season practices
where there are alleged overages,
the overage is approximately two
hours in a week," Brandon said.
"During the season on some Sun-
days, the allegation is that the Uni-
versity of Michigan exceeded the
daily permissible practice time by
less than an hour.
In a single instance, the allega-
tion is that an overage caused the
team to exceed its 20-hour weekly
permissible limit by 20 minutes."
He continued: "I have looked
into these permissible practice
hours issues, and I want to empha-
size there were no situations where
any student-athlete's welfare was

put at risk."
However, Brandon reaffirmed
that he would stand behind
Rodriguez and that he would
return next year as the team's
head coach.
"Rich Rodriguez is our football
coach," Brandon said during the
press conference.
Brandon added that he believes
the reason behind some of the alle-
gations is the result of "internal
confusion."
"We had alack of clarity around
whether time spent in stretch-
ing and warm-up activities were
'countable minutes,' and this rep-
resents a portion of the discrepan-
cies between the NCAA's findings
and our practice routines," he said.
"Two of the NCAA allegations
relate to how the institution and
the coach monitored those two
areas of concern."
Brandon stressed that the
NCAA's notice of allegations found
no loss of institutional control.
"This is very important, there
was no charge of loss of institu-
tional control - none whatsoever,"
Brandon said.

University-Wide
Smoking Ban
In 2009, President Coleman
announced that a campus-wide
smoking ban will take effect on
July 1, 2011. Amidst complaints
from students and faculty alike,
'U' officials supported Coleman's
decision, stating that a smoke-
free campus will help to create a
"culture of health." Nevertheless,
many students still charge that
their voices have not been heard.

Big Man at the Big House
Why Obama is the right choice for commencement speaker

This year, the field of Michigan Stadium
will play host to President Barack Obama
as he delivers the keynote address at
spring commencement ceremonies. Obama is
the perfect figure to send University graduates
off as they depart from the University to pursue
their careers. Obama's history in academia and
ability to demonstrate the ideals that an insti-
tution of higher learning should embody make
him the ideal candidate to speak at the Univer-
sity's spring commencement.
It's difficult to think of a more appropriate key-
note speaker for the University's commencement
ceremony, even if one considers only Obama's
unrivaled ability to encourage students. During
Obama's campaign for the White House, his mes-
sage ofhope and change, alongwithhis infectious
charisma, resonated with voters nationwide, and
especially with students. Regardless of one's
political opinions, it's undeniable that Obama
generated more enthusiasm and excitement
among students than any other political figure in
recent memory. And Obama motivated many stu-
dents to not only think, but to act - successfully
mobilizing students in an unheard-of movement
and gettingthem to the polls in force.
Obama's charisma aside, he also demon-
strates a strong commitment to the values that
the University shares. Intellectually tenacious,
committed to public service and a beacon of
multiculturalism, Obama possesses leadership
qualities that graduates should emulate.
Obama's biography and life experiences allow
him to speak with authority to a wide range of
people as diverse as the University's 2010 grad-
uating class. Obama, who made history when
CHRIS KOSLOWSKI Ie

he was elected the nation's first black president,
has lived a life that provides him with the per-
spective and experience to speak with author-
ity to students from traditionally marginalized
groups and less privileged backgrounds. His
multiracial heritage and childhood in a single-
parent family are perhaps more relevant to
many students than the privileged backgrounds
that often accompany distinguished leaders.
Obama is the right person to speak to students
who intend to lead in thought and action. The
University has a history of producing leaders in a
wide range of fields, from former President Ger-
ald Ford to great American playwright Arthur
Miller to the entire crew of astronauts of the
Apollo 15 mission. This kind of leadership could
hardly be better exemplified than in Obama. As
a community organizer in Chicago's South Side,
Obama applied his mind to the challenges fac-
ing the area. He carried his commitment to his
values into the Illinois legislature and the U.S.
Senate. Now, he represents the United States in
confronting major global conflicts. There is no
leader better qualified to provide students with
advice on leadership.
The University's 2010 graduates face daunt-
ing challenges as they enter the job market,
considering the cripplingeconomic climate. But
Obama's career success makes him the perfect
speaker for this group of students. As an aca-
demic, community activist and successful poli-
tician, he can provide University graduates with
valuable insight on leadership in the real world.
The University could have fared no better in the
commencement speaker.

h, the obligatory good-
bye column - a graduat-
ing opinion writer's last
duty. The aim
is to say some-
thing insight-
ful about the #
future by
reflecting on
one's time at
the University.
But when I sat
down to write ROBERT
this column SOAVE
two nights
ago, nothing
worthwhile sprung to mind. I
tossed three terrible drafts in the
trash before finally giving up and
heading out for a walk.
I was hoping it would be one
of those walks where I just let my
feet carry me forward, randomly
stumbling across people and plac-
es from the past, generating ideas
for this column. After ten min-
utes, I had walked directly to the
only place my feet were trained to
take me - the front steps of The
Michigan Daily.
This newspaper has been both
the greatest challenge and deepest
reward of my time at the Univer-
sity. I arrived in the fall of 2006 as
a brash, naive conservative with
a sincere desire to infiltrate and
eliminate what was in my view
the University's arbiter of liberal
propaganda, The Michigan Daily.
Imagine my surprise when the
Daily actually hired me.
What followed was a long,
demanding and enjoyable career
as a columnist and, eventually, the
editorial page editor. Expecting
to make enemies with the rest of
the writers, I instead gained life-
long friends. And while some of
my views certainly rubbed off on
the Daily's editorial perspective,
having to defend arguments that
I didn't necessarily agree with
influenced my opinions as well.
The ideological exchange was well
worth it, and my opinions became

more sensible because of it.
Bidding farewell to the Daily the
other night, I headed back toward
my apartment. As I crossed the
Diag, I inadvertently stepped on
the block M for the very first time,
having avoided it for years due to
that silly superstition about fail-
ing blue book exams. Like most of
you, I first heard that one at fresh-
man orientation, when the entire
campus seemed like a daunting
maze of mythology, tradition and
the unknown. I wondered how
I was possibly going to survive
the next four years. Meeting new
people, getting good grades, suc-
cessfully navigating LSA distri-
bution requirements and finding
adequate housing - all without
going broke - seemed like it would
be more than I could handle.
And you know what? Some-
times, it was more than I could
handle. I've had more than my
fair share of disappointing grades.
I ran out of money. And I'm still
expecting to discover some hidden
LSA requirement that I missed,
barring me from graduation.
Still, the most important les-
sons weren't discovered in
classes. They were learned as a
consequence of interacting with
students who dressed differ-
ently than me, listened to dif-
ferent music, had different goals
for their lives and had different
beliefs about themselves and the
world. Ann Arbor has imparted
to us its lessons about tolerance,
diversity, peace and personal
freedom. It's changed us - and
mostly for the better.
But the world around us has
changed considerably, too. When
we first arrived at the University,
George W. Bush was still the pres-
ident, and the nation was already
tired of the wars in the Middle
East. Four years later, we're even
more tired of them. In 2008, the
United States elected its first
black president, who will reward
the many University students

supposed to do.
With that in mind, I made my
third and final stop on my walk - 9
the Arb. It's both prohibited and
slightly terrifying to enter the Arb
at night, but I needed to say good-
bye to my favorite place at a time
when no one else could interrupt
me. And surrounded by the dark
woods, the one piece of advice I
had to offer finally came to me:Do
something that you're notsupposed
to do.
2010 graduates face a future
that is just as grim yet as won-
drously mysterious as the Arb at
night. We won't fix this troubled
world of ours by following all the
rules. We go forward as people
with the right and the responsibil-
ity to question the presumptions
of all forms of authority to create
a more freethinking and critical-
minded society.
And undergraduates, that
goes for you too. Start a provoca-
tive group. Protest a policy you
disagree with. Tell your profes-
sors and classmates that they're
wrong. Take a walk through the A
Arb at night. But whatever you do,
love every minute of it.
To my readers: Thank you for
hearing me out all these years. It's
been a pleasure and an honor.

Access denied
Regents continue to skirt ADA standards

A mong us graduating
seniors, a great divide is
opening - one unlike any
we have faced
before.
This divi-
sion does not
conform to one
of the irrecon-
cilable binaries'
that typically
separate people
in our nation. GARY
It's not between GRACA
men and
women, Repub-
licans and Dem-
ocrats, whites and blacks, the haves
and have-nots, those who believe in
smallgovernment and those who -
accordingto those in the Tea Party
movement - hate America, or even
Team Edward and Team Jacob.
More concerning, it is not a dif-
ference we can easily hide. It's
noticeable during conversations
at bars, parties, saloons, watering
holes, American Cafes and other
places where young people - lack-
ing in work ethic and recently
empowered to legally consume
alcohol - gather. It's etched into
our eyes when abstract topics like
"the future" are mentioned. It's
woven into the tone of our voices
when we talk toour parents.
It is, of course, the division
between those who know what
they're doing after May 1, 2010 and
those who do not. And it's quickly
becoming a difference that may
split the student bodyin half.
I'm here to plead for an end to
the madness.We can't continue liv-
ing like this - those with well-laid

plans smugly implying that they
are mentally, physically, emotion-
ally and sexually superior because
they have jobs or graduate school
plans while those without direc-
tion tell them to "eat shit" under
their breath.
Just as importantly, we can't
continue drinking this much alco-
hol, whether it's out of jubilation
for our future or because we want
to wallow in our misfortune. We
almost certainly risk severely dam-
aging our livers, if not the brain
cells that got us through this place.
Instead, we must realize that,
come May 1, 2010, we all share one
very special trait: privilege.
Statistically speaking, as college
graduates, we are now entering a
new American social class. We'll
be much more likely than our high
school graduate friends to have
full-time, year-round employment,
earn thousands of dollars more in
annual income, own homes and
marry wealthier spouses. We'll be
much less likely to spend time in
a prison or be a victim of violent
crime. In other words, it's much
more likely that - across many
metrics - we will lead comfortable
lives. At the very least, we won't
have to worry so much about some
of the basics like food and shelter.
That future probably attracted
many of us to the University of
Michigan. Sure, we came for the
high-minded intellectual jour-
ney. Or maybe we just came for a
chance to leave the nest. But that
after-college horizon loomed in the
distance the whole time - and it
looked pretty attractive.
But here's where the danger lies.

A fine line exists between desiring
that future and believing it's owed
to us. From there, it's a hop, skip
and a jump to the belief that others
don't deserve this future because
they didn't spend tens of thousands
of dollars and a handful of sleep-
less nights studying like we did.
or, alternatively, that those people
who didn't take the same road we
did should have.
We all share one
very special
trait: privilege.
The best of us sometimes
become trapped in this elitist
view - even the do-gooders who
spend their free time volunteer-
ing in crumbling cities and donat-
ing their extra money to charity.
When we begin to think we have
a right to a bright future, we for-
get what's truly important. We
forget that while a desk job push-
ing paper may pay more than a job
growing food, making clothing or
building houses, it may not be as
vital to our existence or happi-
ness as a society.
As the supposed incoming class
of privileged elites, I hope the one
thing that ends up uniting our
future is an awareness that we're
really no better than anyone else,
degree or not.

In one last confirmation that nothing - not
fans, not tradition and not even the law -
will stand between the University and its
quest to add skyboxes to Michigan Stadium,
the University Board of Regents gave its final
approval of the project last Thursday. But as
the plan continues to ignore the opposition
- and pending lawsuit - from the Michigan
Paralyzed Veterans of America it has evolved
into a mockery of the University's tradition of
diversity and acceptance.
Back in April, the Michigan Paralyzed Vet-
erans of America filed a lawsuit against the
University because the stadium project fails to
meet the guidelines of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act of 1990. According to that law, any
stadium built after 1990 must make 1 percent
of its seating handicap accessible and that seat-
ing must be dispersed throughout the stadium.
For the University, this means that more than

1,000 of the current 107,501 seats in the stadium
should be handicap accessible. The project only
increases that number of seats to282.
Instead of meeting the requirements of the
law, though, the University has danced around
the issue. Although the University agrees that
the new luxury boxes must meet ADA stan-
dards, by classifying the changes to the con-
crete bowl as repairs and not renovations, the
University is skirting the ADA requirements.
But the University's stance is nothing more
than semantics. There are legitimate renovations
being made to the concrete bowl including wid-
ening the aisles and eliminating more than 4,000
bleacher seats. By ignoring these concerns, the
University is putting itself in an uncertain legal
situation that could topple the stadium construc-
tion just as it begins - wasting much of the $226
million going to the project.

The Michigan Student Assembly was established to advocate for student con-
cerns and improve the experience of those attending the University. Here's a look
back on some memorable stories featuring MSA during your time here.

Still talking about that website

A new year for MSA
Atop the list of major changes in MSA this semester,
several old faces won't be around. Earlier this month,
MSA Rep. Anton Vuljaj pleaded guilty to felony charges
for his denial-of-service attack on the Michigan Pro-
gressive Party's website during the 2006 MSA elec-
tions. Similarly, before winter break MSA president
Zack Yost and Rep. Kenny Baker resigned from their
positions after it was revealed that the two were mem-
bers of a controversial Facebook group mocking Rep.
Tim Hull's Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism.
The assembly should start by improving its commu-
nication with students. When the assembly completes
projects, it's usually because it demonstrates to the
administration that its demands reflect mass student
concern. But students have no reliable way of knowing
what is happening in MSA or how they can help.
These are easy problems to fix. The website is cur-
rently under construction after a change in webmas-
ters. That's a good start. But the changes need to go
beyond aesthetics.
- Jan.15, 2008

Wasting students' time
After two long, drawn-out meetings, the Michi-
gan Student Assembly finally passed that it had
debated for so long - a statement expressing regret
for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. As the student
government of the University, MSA is supposed
to represent the students and work toward solv-
ing issues that concern them. But with this reso-
lution, it has only wasted time arguing about an
issue over which it has no jurisdiction to address.
The assembly needs to follow through on its
promise of better lighting across campus. It needs
to improve its website so that students have a way of
checking up and seeing what's going on in MSA. Rep-
resentatives need to confront campus crime. And, as
the University faces the prospect of decreased fund-
ing from the state, students are counting on MSA to
be their voice for college affordability. What we're
getting now is a student government that cares
more about debating distant international issues
than discussing the improvements students need.
- Jan. 26, 2009

Blind to oversight
A recent investigation by the Daily revealed that the
Department of Public Safety Oversight Committee is
all but incapable of fulfilling its basic function. Not only
are student representatives illegally appointed by MSA
rather than elected in a campus-wide election, but the
student seats on the committee have been empty for
months at a time. This year, there was no student rep-
resentation from May through November. This com-
mittee - designed to keep tabs on police who directly
intervene in students' lives - simply isn't making sure
it includes a consistent student voice.
MSA's defense of this policy also smacks of Univer-
sity administration over-involvement in MSA affairs.
When University professor Dr. Douglas Smith e-mailed
the assembly regarding its appointment of students to
the committee. Soon afterwards, MSA pulled an about-
face and asserted that it was, without a doubt, follow-
ing the law. The fact that the University appears to
be forcing its legal defense upon MSA further under-
mines the credibility of the assembly.
- Nov.18, 2009

Site not found
Last week, MSA President Abhishek Mahanti
announced that MSA had drastically exceeded its
budget to repair and update its website, which has
long been in need of update. MSA spent an appall-
ing $9,000 on graphic and web designers, though it
budgeted only $3,000 for the project. Not only did
MSA mismanage its funds, it isn't even using the
website it spent $9,000 attempting to fix. MSA has
failed to justify the trust that students place in it to
spend their money wisely, and it has a responsibility
to monitor its use of funds more closely in the future.
MSA exists to improve student life on campus,
but the assembly has repeatedly failed to fulfill this
role. This event is sure to stick in students' memories,
along with last year's several meetings spent discuss-
ing a resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
over which it has no jurisdiction. Pledges to work with
the Ann Arbor City Council to improve off-campus
lighting continue to go unfulfilled. The failed web-
site is a testament to MSA's ongoing incompetence.

Michigan men's gymnastics coach Kurt Golder accepts the NCAA Championship trophy after the Wolverines took home the title last Friday night,
A' 9wins first AA title since t99

New York - After four hours of
competition and six rotations of
events, the No. 3 Michigan men's
gymnastics team was leading the
NCAA Championship finals by .3
points over Stanford.
And the Wolverines wouldn't
need much more than that on Friday
night, as the men's gymnastics team
took home the program's fourth
national title and Michigan's first
team varsity national championship
since 2005. In the process, the team
avenged last year's 1.3-point cham-
pionship loss to Stanford.
Leading the way for Michigan
was junior Chris Cameron. He was
selected as the Big Ten Gymnast of
the Year two weeks ago and won
the all-around competition at Big
Tens. So winning this year's NCAA
all-around victory came as no sur-
prise to spectators in Crisler Arena.
Cameron posted a total score of
90.5, which was good enough to
upend the defending champ from
Oklahoma - Steve Legendre - by
1.55 points. Senior Mel Santander
placed third in the all-around with

"I usually grasp everything I've
done right away," Cameron said.
"Not this. This hasn't hit me yet."
Michigan coach Kurt Golder
said afterward that he thought the
experience of coming up just short
last season helped the Wolverines.
"Finishing second last year gave
us a lot of incentive," Golder said.
"They had a team meeting last year
after the NCAA Championships,
and they made a commitment to do
everything in their power to win
it. It's just great for all of us that it
worked out."
In the team's losses this year, the
pommel horse and the fifth rota-
tion were weak spots for Michigan.
These routines were plagued with
mistakes and falls. With a score of
58.85 on the pommel horse and a
meet-high 59.50 on the rings dur-
ing the fifth rotation, victory was
almost assured for the Wolverines.
Placing first on Thursday
allowed Michigan to choose its
starting event on Friday.
Knowing they would end on the
highest-scoring event - vault -

confident, despite trailing Stanford
the entire meet. Going into the last
event, Michigan was down by 3.05
points. After scoring a 62.70 on
vault, they looked sure to win.
But it wasn't over. Due to a bro-
ken ring, anybody who fell on their
dismount on the rings was given a
second chance to compete.
Oklahoma was a full three points
behind Michigan at this point, so
the likelihood of them catching up
was slim to none, even with two
competitors left. And as it turned
out, junior Thomas Kelley was able
to compete again, increasing Mich-
igan's score, and sealing the deal for
the national championship.
The top eight scorers in each
event Friday were crowned All-
Americans and went on to compete
for individual event titles on Satur-
day. Redshirt senior Kent Caldwell
was named All-American on the
floor exercise and vault and redshirt
senior Ryan McCarthy won the only
event title for Michigan on high bar.
"I had to focus on making sure
that I was aggressive on my high

thing came into place after that. I
caught my release move, did a good
dismount, and a clean landing."
Following McCarthy on the high
bar, junior Ian Makowske placed
second and Santander tied for third.
Santander and junior Thomas
Kelley placed second and fifth on
the parallel bars. Cameron and
McCarthy were also All-American
on the parallel bars, tying for sev-
enth.
Though the season is over, some
Wolverines are not done yet.

Icers magical postseason run ends early

'M' loses to Miami
(Ohio) in second
! round of the NCAA
Tournament
March 29, 2010 - FORT
WAYNE, Ind. - EnricoBlasi looked
onward from high atop Allen Coun-
ty War Memorial Coliseum on Sat-
urday night.
Blasilooked relaxed,sittinginthe
last row, leaning back with his legs
draped over the seat in front of him.
Perched so high after his team's
win over Alabama-Huntsville, the
Miami (Ohio) coach watched the
beginning of the Michigan hockey
team's 5-1 dismantling of the No. 2
seed Bemidji State in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament.
The Wolverines' speed and pre-
cision methodically took advan-
tage of the Beaver's mistakes - just
like they did a week earlier against
Miami in the CCHA Tournament.
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson told Blasi on Friday that
the Wolverines did everything
they could in the two teams' CCHA
semifinal matchup last weekend
- which Michigan won 5-2 - to
help the RedHawks prepare for the
NCAA Tournament.
Maybe it was too much prepara-
tion, as the Wolverines lost 3-2 in
double overtime Sunday night.
It was a bittersweet ending to a
Cinderella run for the Wolverines,
who had won seven straight games
in March, entering Sunday, which
propelled them into the NCAA
Tournament and past Bemidji State

in the first round.
It was even more remarkable
considering Michigan had been the
lower seed in the past five contests.
Michigan (26-18-1 overall) and
Miami had already played each
other three times this season and
the play was as even as it could be
throughout the NCAA Midwest
regional final game.
Each team was feeling the other
out, with quick jabs here and there,
as junior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick and the RedHawks' sopho-
more goalie Connor Knapp seemed
to try to outdo each other.
But the save Hunwick couldn't
make made the difference.
Miami (29-7-7) carried the play
for most of the third period with
the score dead even at 2-2.
The RedHawks watched a puck
that bounced over Hunwick's left
shoulder clang off the post with
three minutes left in the game.
Then, less than three minutes
into the first overtime, a referee
blew a play dead for a penalty on
Miami right before freshman for-
ward Kevin Lynch knocked home a
loose puck.
"I thought it was a goal," senior
defenseman Steve Kampfer said.
"We were all jumping up and down
on the bench. I don't know.
"Right there and then you get the
momentum, they're down and out."
The Wolverines picked up their
intensity in the first overtime while
it seemed that Miami was playing
more timidly, as Michigan outshot
the RedHawks 20-6.
The game was scoreless for near-
ly 60 minutes after Miami knotted
the game at the beginning of the

second period. That is, until a puck
trickled under Hunwick's pads.
"I think this (game) hurts the
most," Kampfer said. "On a stand-
point of we weren't supposed to be
here, we had a great run going."
Michigan scored five goals on
the CCHA Player of the Year, soph-
omore goaltender Cody Reichard,
when the teams met at Joe Louis
Arena on March 20.
Sunday night, Blasi decided to go
with Knapp and the netminder val-
idated his coach's decision, making
55 saves.
"You're so close," Berenson said.
"If we would have gotten (to the
Frozen Four), this team was really
making believers out of everyone
that two months ago wouldn't have

given us hope in heck of making a
Ford Field, Frozen Four appear-
ance. This would've been great."
And the Wolverines went toe to
toe with the No. 1 seed in the entire
NCAA Tournament Sunday for 82
minutes.
"It's a fine line between winning
(and losing)," Berenson said. "I don't
even feel like we lost. I feel so good
about our team and what they've
accomplished..... The thing I like
about this team was that they really
came together. There was no indi-
vidual agendas. There was no one
worried about the wrong things.
"Everybody was for the team.
And that had to be a great feeling
for these guys in the locker room."

Blue grabs NCAA Tournament berth for first time in 11 years

March 16, 2009 - The Michigan
faithful waited more than 4,000
days and watched more than 300
games in preparation for a day like
Sunday.
And judging by the turnout at
Crisler Arena, it was worth it.
For the first time since 1998, the
Michigan men's basketball team
has earned an NCAA Tournament
bid. CBS announced Sunday night
that No. 10 Michigan would face
No. 7 Clemson in the South Region-
al in Kansas City.
If the Wolverines win, they will
face the winner of No. 2 Oklahoma
and No. 15 seed Morgan State.
"I knew that the country wants
to see the block 'M' back at the
dance," MichiganAthletic Director

Bill Martin said.
The Wolverines have played
their best basketball this season
with their backs against the wall.
Michigan was the 61st team to
have its name called Sunday, which
put the team through the grinder
yet again.
"It wasvery appropriate because
that kind of sums up our season,"
fifth-year senior C.J. Lee said.
When studio host Greg Gumbel
finally said 'Michigan' on the CBS
telecast, it was to the tune of hun-
dreds of screaming fans who filled
the lower bowl on the east side of
Crisler Arena.
Michigan coach John Beilein
addressed the crowd after the
show.

"I don't even know because of
all the excitement, where are we
going?" Beilein asked.
Michigan waited more than a
half hour to hear its name called
- not an easy task for players or
coaches.
"I was so nervous," fifth-year
senior co-captain David Merritt
said. "My stomach was turning
over just to think that there was a
chance we wouldn't make it.
"Luckily and thank God that our
name came up as a10 (seed)."
Assistant coach Mike Jackson
was also feeling the pressure.
"I told Coach (John) Mahoney
after the second (regional) that
we were probably going to be in
the last group, not really believing

against Illinois, Purdue and twice

made the tournament, also helped
Michigan's cause.
Despite sitting on the bubble for
the past few weeks, the Wolverines
essentially locked a bid after top-
ping Iowa 73-45 in the first round
of the Big Ten Tournament on
Thursday.
Even after dropping its quar-
terfinal matchup against Illinois,
Merritt was confident that Michi-
gan had done enough to earn a bid.
Although Beilein said making
the tournament with the Wolver-
ines is ahead of his initial rebuild-
ing process, both the team and fans
appear ready.

In Rainbows, whether Radiohead
released it as such or not, is not an album
in the traditional sense. Nothing about this
disc breathes cohesiveness. Its movements
are shaky, aggressive and collapsing - and,'
more telling, none of them even remotely
connect totheothers. In essence, this album
is a mixtape: a mass of widely collected, dis-
connected moments aligned in single-file.
As recording for this album has been
traced back tothe late '90s - circa the mas-
terpiece OK Computer - the entirety of In
Rainbows can be broken down according
to prior releases. "Nude," "Bodysnatchers" Taste the rainbows.

track's cumulous strings and bobbing bass
are heartbreaking, yet sunnier than ear-
lier work. You don't listen to the song, you
float through it. It engulfs your every sense
and wraps you up like an anxious lover.
"15 Step" is similarly nostalgic. Its jazzy
undertones give way to percussively driven
twerps and twitches.
Pay what you please
for In Rainbows.
Yet with all its familiar pieces, it's
increasingly difficult to view In Rainbows
as a Radiohead release. Shedding the man-
tra of several of its previous records (an
overarching concept contextualizing each
disc), the album stands afar from Radio-
head's other work. It plays as a coalescing
retrospective rather than a unique, unified
album. And yet seemingly without prior
knowledge of Radiohead's catalog, In Rain-
bows would be a rather easily accessible
collection, the most striking contradiction
in this heap of contradictions.
But maybe In Rainbows is the full real-
ization of Radiohead's prolific career - a
career that travels sinusoidally rather than
in disconnected movements. With its spa-
cious lines weaving back upon themselves,
this album has finally reached the crest of
the wave once again - a point seemingly
first met, though more magnificently, with
OK Computer.
Maybe this album doesn't make sense.
or maybe it makes sense of everything.

UMMA's reopening attracted tens of thousands of guests.

Your UMMA

An 'Avatar' for our time

By KAKI PANDEY
Daily Film Editor
Jan. 5, 2010 - To slightly rephrase a
quote from James Cameron's new endeav-
or, "Avatar," "Well, what'd you expect,
numb-nuts?"
Recall that Cameron, *
in all of his bombastic
arrogance, is the preemi- Avatar
nent visual storyteller of
our age, pioneering new 20th Century Fox
technological innova-
tions in each of his films while never sacri-
ficing the narrative quality. Since directing
"The Terminator" in 1984, Cameron has
crafted an unblemished directorial resume
of iconic blockbusters, from the thrill ride
of "Aliens" to the action extravaganza of
"Terminator 2" to the tear-inducing spec-
tacle of "Titanic." So with "Avatar," did you
really expect anything less than a colossal
achievement?
Sure, it's made with cutting edge tech-
nology, but "Avatar" has an old-school
science-fiction mass appeal that makes it
endearingly great. It's one of those movies
that everyone from your Santa-believing
niece to your agoraphobic grandparents
will watch, love, then drag all their friends
with them to watch again.
"Avatar" roughly translates from San-
skrit as the "reincarnation of a deity in a
physical form," and the title packs a wallop
of a double meaning. The film's narrative is
driven by this concept, with human minds
controlling genetically modified bodies
of the Na'vi, the indigenous population of
the planet Pandora. But the audience also
has an avatar of its own in the form of Jake
Sully (Sam Worthington, "Terminator Sal-
vation"), a paraplegic ex-marine. Through
Sully and his Na'vi avatar, we experience
the heart-stopping wonder of the alien
planet, we share Sully's terror at its abun-

dant perils and, finally, we understand the
complex spiritual natureof Pandoraand its
civilization.
Cameron's desire to create "Avatar" as
an immersive experience led to his creation
of brand-new cameras, revolutionizing the
implementation of 3-D in film. Gone is the
gimmickyuse of this technology - the ran-
dom pop-outs from the screen used only
for shock value. The 3-D effects are used
in "Avatar" to dissolve the invisible bar-
rier between the audience and the screen,
pulling characters and environments out of
their typically flat dimensions.
A multidimensional
masterpiece.
Including the film's brilliant use of 3-D,
the list of what works in "Avatar" is end-
less. Let's start off with the real star of
the film: the planet Pandora itself. From
the stunning suspended-in-air Hallelu-
jah Mountains to the ethereal Tree of
Souls, the film has gorgeous visuals up
the wazoo. The effects that create the
landscapes are so refined, they resemble
an episode of the Discovery Channel epic
"Planet Earth" more than computer-gen-
erated imagery.
Even the Na'vi, created through
the generally reviled technology
of motion-capture animation, look
astonishingly authentic. Through
new cameras, developed for "Avatar"
alone, Cameron magically makes the
giant, blue aliens appear as real as the
humans opposing them.
Although the film's archetyp-
al "Pocahontas" meets "Dances

with Wolves" story is quite predictable, it's
told exceedingly well. It's a classic tale of
good versus evil, forbidden love and self-
discovery. It's an emotional roller-coaster
that will tear your heart through incred-
ible tragedies, then later have you cheering
in jubilation.
These emotional shifts are especially
evident during the climactic battle, a
marvel of visual artistry and action cho-
reography. The action in "Avatar" is never
excessive or glorified, and it keeps in line
with the film's decidedly liberal-leaning
politics. The anti-corporatism, pro-envi-
ronment themes and parallels to the Iraq
War keep the film relevant, but the mes-
sages are a bit too obtuse.
"Avatar" is more than a movie - it's a
jaw-dropping, heart-palpitating experi-
ence. It's movies of this magnitude that
redefine cinema; new precedents have
been established so that motion-capture
performances, 3-D and visual effects as a
whole will never be the same again. After
a 13-year absence since "Titanic" shattered
box-office records and rocked the Oscars,
James Cameron has returned with "Ava-
tar" to reclaim his throne as the king of the
world. 3,:

Renovated 'U' museum
takes new approach in
making art accessible
By KATIE CAREY
Daily Arts Writer
Apr. 1, 2009 - The extent of artwork at
the corner of State and South University
over the past three years has been limited
to the obscure Orion sculpture by Mark di
Suvero that was installed this fall.
But now, there are over 18,000 pieces in
the newly refurbished University of Michi-
gan Museum of Art.
The line to get into the museum for the
Mar. 24 student opening wrapped around
the block, reaching to East University. Over
15,000 people attended the 24-hour public
opening and nearly 24,000 attended by the
end of the weekend. The new collection
sparked an artistic dialogue that had been
absent on campus for far too long.
Though some students may have only
come for the Zingerman's gift certificates
and free food, many stayed to talk about the
artwork with friends, ask questions about
origins of the art and postulate their own
artistic philosophies. The attending stu-
dents weren't only typical museum-goers
but people from all areas of study.
"We didn't want to be a museum for
just artists and art historians," said James
Steward, UMMA museum director.
"Before, the museum was an adjunct to
their studies - yet, the vast majority ofstu-
dents are not studying (art). We wanted it
to be a hangout space, a place you can go to
have other types of experiences."
The events at the opening were a glimpse
into the wide-ranging experiences the
museum has to offer. A trio performed a skit
about Picasso, students danced through the
museum in handmade costumes and come-
dy and poetry events constantly circulated
throughout the auditorium.
Gone are the days when a museum could
remain relevant by hanging up a few mas-
terpieces. UMMA works at providing a
dynamic space for not only paintings and
sculptures, but all types of art. With future
plans to make partnerships with the Zell
Writers Series, the Screen Arts & Cultures
department and the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance, UMMA is capitalizing on
the idea of "a meeting place for the arts."
"We're trying to express that one type
or one form of art isn't that much greater
than the others and that we can try to make
some connective tissue," Steward said.
The UMMA experience is tailored to
fit students' needs. Whether it be the free
WiFi and the comfy chairs or the extended
hours and free admission, students will
find deeper reasons for enjoying UMMA.
"Art is a fundamental way of learn-
ing about the world ... whether or
not it's a student's chosen profes-

sion," said UMMA Director of Education
Ruth Slavin.
Added museum resources help students
engage with the artworks. Besides the
protocol placard next to each piece, there
is additional information in each exhibit
space as well as storage drawers under
many of the sculptures. This way, visitors
aren't overwhelmed with information but
can learn more if they feel inclined.
"We wanted to take things beyond labels.
There are backstories (drawn) from popular
culture and science that help people engage
with the art in a different way," Slavin said.
Art museums can seem intimidat-
ing or irrelevant, especially if the visitors
aren't well versed in the subjects at hand.
Walking up a long flight of stairs, passing
between huge monolithic columns in order
to enter a space that holds something virtu-
ally unknown is not always comforting.
UMMA has combated this traditionally
intimidating museum ambiance by pushing
back against traditional museum architec-
ture and opening its walls with floor-to-ceil-
ing glass windows. In doingso, it essentially
nixes the notion of the exclusive, academic
institution and puts art into the street - or
the Diag - for the public to see.
This approach also allows the casual pass-
erby to catch a glimpse of what's inside, with
hopes to encourage the insecure to make the
epic journey up the stairs. The first big hur-
dle is getting people into the museum. But
the real challenge is making them stay.
The labyrinthine design of the museum
forces visitors to weave through galleries
they may never have walked through oth-
erwise, potentially introducing them to a
type of artwork or artist they weren't inter-
ested in previously. It's nearly impossible to
visit the new UMMA and head straight for
a specific room without catching a glimpse
of something completely unexpected.
Alexandra Miller, an LSA senior who
attended the 24-hour opening, was espe-
cially impressed by the design of the verti-
cal gallery - the three-story, awe-inspiring
exhibit space that allows visitors to see into
multiple exhibits at once.
"It's almost like a CliffNotes (on Art His-
tory) - it's this spectrum; you can be look-
ing at an abstract work and see Asian art out
of the corner of your eye," Miller said.
This same idea is reflected in the stor-
age gallery on the upper balcony of the
apse. The effect of having contemporary
art, African art and Indian religious fig-
ures alongside Japanese sculpture helps
the viewer fill in the gaps between previ-
ously separated art forms and begin to bet-
ter piece together the power that art has on
understanding a shared universal past.
After a full week of opening events, it
may seem appropriate to bask in the after-
glow of the successful renovation. But the
excitement doesn't end at opening week-
end. UMMA is open for the rest of the year,
the rest of your college education - UMMA
is yours for the taking.
