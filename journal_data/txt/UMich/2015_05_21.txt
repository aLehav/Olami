Davis-Blake 

says she plans to 
focus on broader 
educational issues

By ALYSSA BRANDON and 

LAURA SCHINAGLE
Summer Managing News Editor 

and Summer Editor in Chief

In an e-mail to Ross School 

of Business students Monday, 
Business School Dean Alison 
Davis-Blake announced she is 
stepping down.

“... I will step down from the 

deanship at the completion of my 
term on June 30, 2016,” Davis-
Blake said in the e-mail. “The 
Provost’s Office will convene a 
search committee to select the 
next dean. I am confident that, 
with your help and support, Pro-
vost Pollack and President Schlis-
sel will be able to conduct a very 
successful search.”

The University’s Board of 

Regents approved Davis-Blake’s 
five-year term in 2011. Davis-
Blake came to the University 

after serving as dean of the Carl-
son School of Management at the 
University of Minnesota since 
2006. She was the first female 
dean in both schools’ histories.

Davis-Blake’s term coincided 

with real estate mogul Stephen 
Ross’s 
$200-million 
donation 

to the University. The donation, 
which was split between the 
Business School and the Athletic 
Department, was the largest in 
the University’s history. Davis-
Blake was among administrators 
involved in discussion regarding 
the donation’s beneficiaries.

During her tenure, Davis-

Blake helped create the Master 
of Management program, expand 
the Executive MBA program to 
Los Angeles and reorganize the 
undergraduate BBA curriculum.

Business 
senior 
Madeline 

Walsh, who was the Central Stu-
dent Government representative 
for the Business School during 
the 2014-2015 academic year 
and will serve in the upcoming 
academic year as well, said the 
Business School’s curriculum has 
undergone positive change under 
Davis-Blake’s leadership.

“As a rising senior, my entire 

Ross experience has been under 
the leadership of Dean Davis-
Blake,” Walsh said. “In just four 
years, I’ve been impressed and 
inspired by her initiatives to chal-
lenge the process of what a busi-
ness education looks like.”

Walsh 
said 
the 
programs 

Davis-Blake helped create have 
diversified 
opportunities 
for 

undergraduate Business students 
to prepare for the increasingly 
global workforce.

“She has lead a complete 

revamp of the BBA program to 
allow for more flexibility, the 
option for a longer global expe-
rience, and further exploration 
beyond the core classes with 
increased electives,” she said. 
“I’m especially excited by the 
Sanger 
Leadership 
Initiative 

which is arising from a ($200-mil-
lion donation) she helped secure.”

Davis-Blake said she values 

how her deanship allowed her to 
help find solutions for challenges 
faced in the Business School, but 
wants to shift her focus to broad-
er issues in professional and lib-
eral education.

“I find myself eager to contrib-

Students request 

meeting in response 
to Harbaugh’s tweet 
supporting the film

By LAURA SCHINAGLE

Summer Editor in Chief

Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh met with Middle East-
ern, North African, Muslim and 
South Asian students in a private 
meeting in the Michigan Union on 
Wednesday to discuss the Univer-
sity’s April screening of the movie 
“American Sniper,” a film based on 
the autobiography of former U.S. 
Navy Seal Chris Kyle.

E-mails obtained by the Daily 

sent Tuesday to listservs for various 
student organizations — including 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality, the Middle East and Arab 
Network, the Arab Students Asso-
ciation, the South Asian Awareness 
Network, 
Michigan 
Pakistanis, 

and Muslim, Lebanese, Malaysian 
and Persian students — announced 
plans for the meeting. The e-mails 
said several students requested 
the meeting in response to a tweet 
Harbaugh sent April 8 regarding 
the movie.

“Michigan Football will watch 

‘American Sniper’! Proud of Chris 
Kyle & Proud to be an American & 
if that offends anybody then so be 
it!” the tweet read.

Harbaugh’s tweet came amid 

national media coverage of the Cen-
ter for Campus Involvement’s April 
7 announcement that it would can-

step down in June 2016

City Council talks 
amendments to 
2015-2016 budget

University grants 
$6.4 million for 
faculty projects 

Council approves 
$89,000 allocation 

toward hiring 

sustainability associate

By ANDREW ALMANI

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

met Monday evening at City Hall 
to discuss a multitude of proposed 
amendments to the city’s 2015-2016 
fiscal year budget, which takes 
effect July 1.

The proposed changes to funding 

related to the creation of outdoor ice 
rinks for public use, climate change 
initiatives and expansion of capa-
bilities for processing organic waste 
in the city.

The council voted unanimously 

to approve a proposal to establish 
natural ice rinks in Allmendinger, 
Burns and Northside parks for cost 
free usage by city residents. Coun-
cilmember Stephen Kunselman (D–
Ward 3) proposed the amendment, 
which will submit $89,169 in general 

fund cash to create the ice rinks.

With acknowledgment of the 

importance of sustainability in the 
Ann Arbor community, the council 
approved putting $80,000 toward 
hiring 
a 
full-time 
sustainabil-

ity associate to advise the city and 
$85,000 toward programs associ-
ated with the city’s Climate Action 
Plan, guiding residents and busi-
nesses to decrease emissions of 
harmful greenhouse gases.

The council also approved an 

allocation of $100,000 from the 
solid waste budget to create a com-
prehensive plan to manage and pro-
cess organic waste in the city.

The city spends money annually 

to send materials that aren’t com-
posted to a private landfill. Upwards 
of 40 percent of materials going to 
landfills from Ann Arbor consists of 
organic waste that has potential to 
be processed. Currently, Ann Arbor 
residents compost roughly half of 
their solid waste. The amendment 
was introduced by Councilmembers 
Julie Grand (D–Ward 3), Graydon 
Krapohl (D–Ward 4) and Kirk West-

Projects focus 
on innovation in 

learning, education 

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

To celebrate the University’s 

upcoming bicentennial, six Uni-
versity faculty projects received 
funding grants totaling almost 
$6.4 million from the University’s 
Third Century Initiative.

The Third Century Initiative 

is $50-million five-year project 
established by University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel and Univer-
sity Provost Martha Pollack meant 
to encourage faculty to brain-
storm ways to improve student 
learning. The recent grant comes 
from Transforming Learning for 
a Third Century, a part of the ini-
tiative dedicated to creating new 
ways for students to experience 
learning.

Four other projects, two of 

which are new, received smaller 
grants that will go toward testing 
their potential for future viability.

James Holloway, vice provost 

for global and engaged education, 
said while the bicentennial allows 
for reflection on what the Uni-
versity has accomplished in the 
past 200 years, the efforts are also 
focused on future innovations.

“As we approach the bicen-

tennial of the University, we are 
thinking very consciously about 
what teaching will mean in the 
third century of the University 
of Michigan,” Holloway said. “A 
residential, public, research insti-
tution like the University of Mich-
igan can provide a unique form of 
engaged learning for students, in 
which activities like undergradu-
ate research, education abroad, 
projects and practica, and engage-
ment with the cultural assets 
of the University and the wider 
world will lead to learning that 
is the foundation of our students’ 
future success.”

Holloway said the overall goal 

of the program is to capture the 
innovative spirit of University fac-
ulty, students and staff, as well as 
challenge the current philosophy 
on student engagement in an edu-

cational environment.

“Of course, as the core of a 

liberal education, we have long 
developed students’ critical think-
ing, writing ability and quantita-
tive reasoning skill,” Holloway 
said. “With the Third Century 
Initiative, we hope to further 
develop our students personally, 
intellectually and professionally 
along dimensions of learning that 
build their understanding of cre-
ativity as a process, their intercul-
tural ability and understanding 
of the role of values in decision-
making, their social and ethical 
reasoning facility, their under-
standing of and capability to col-
laborate, and their self-agency of 
entrepreneurial mindset.”

In total, $25 million was allo-

cated for distribution across three 
project tiers, the top tier being the 
Transformation Learning grants, 
which vary from $100,000 to $3 
million each.

Holloway said these projects 

were chosen by the Transform-
ing Learning for the Third Cen-
tury Committee over 15 other 
proposals in the second round of 
Transformation grants and were 
chosen because of their potential 
for future impact and investment.

“They look for evidence that 

the proposal will have a transfor-
mative impact on learning at the 
University and that the project 
will provide access and visibility 
for engaged, action-based learning 
experiences for a significant num-
ber of University students,” Hollo-
way said. “They also consider the 
extent to which there is evidence 
for the learning effectiveness of 
the transformation, for its sustain-
ability in the long term.”

Six projects received grants 

from the program, including 
“Reimagining Legal Education,” 
a project that aims to innovate 
first-year law student curriculum 
by adding more hands on learn-
ing. The project, which received 
$1.57-million grant, calls for the 
creation a law clinic where first-
year law students can help upper-
level 
students 
with 
intricate 

judicial case.

SACUA talks OIE’s use of recording devices

Committee says 
it will conduct 

additional research 
on privacy policies

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

The Senate Advisory Committee 

on University Affairs met Monday 
to discuss grievance procedures 
within the University’s Office of 

Institutional Equity.

In March, SACUA, the executive 

committee of the body that formally 
represents faculty, filed a report to 
the Office of Institutional Equity 
stating there are several flaws with 
how OIE treats faculty members 
who are subjects of harassment and 
discrimination investigations. The 
report mainly concerned the ade-
quacy of due process protections in 
OIE procedures and OIE’s applica-
tion of those procedures in the cases 
of three faculty members who sub-
mitted complaints to SACUA.

At Monday’s meeting, the commit-

tee focused on the role and usage of 
recording devices during the investi-
gation of one such faculty member.

Michigan’sLaw on Recording 

and Privacy states that if either the 
accused or the complainant express 
concern for privacy , they have a 
right not to be recorded.

Bioethics Prof. Angela Fager-

lin advised having a note-taker if 
recording is not an option during a 
grievance investigation.

“To me, you would want two peo-

ple there: the lawyer and the note-

taker, somebody who doesn’t have to 
do anything but take notes,” she said.

The committee concluded they 

would conduct additional research 
regarding the recording policy, with 
hopes to disseminate knowledge of 
this policy to all University faculty.

SACUA also discussed the new cur-

riculum and training programs offered 
at the University’s medical school.

Pharmacy Prof. David Smith 

announced the Medical Affairs 
Advisory Committee is discussing 
a new curriculum and training for 
medical school students that would 

bring together science and practice.

The new curriculum would allow 

students to learn material through 
hands-on 
experience 
rather 
than 

learning through lecture and discussion.

“For example, instead of learning 

about disease, students will check 
the heart and see how disease func-
tions in the heart,” Smith said.

Smith said the integrated cur-

riculum plan will carry through all 
four years of medical school.

The next SACUA meeting is 

scheduled for June 1.

be a time of significant change in 
higher education,” she said. “After 
much consideration and consul-

tation with my closest advisers, 
friends, and family, I have decided 
that I want to turn the focus of my 
professional service to the broader 
problems and opportunities facing 
universities.”
-cel the movie’s screening sched-
uled for April 10’s UMix. The 
CCI said it made the decision in 
response to a student petition that 
raised concerns about how the 
film portrays Arabs, Muslims, the 
Middle East and North Africa.

However, following another 

student-generated petition call-
ing for the University to reverse 
this decision, E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, 
issued a statement April 8 say-
ing, “the initial decision was not 
consistent with the high value the 
University of Michigan places on 
freedom of expression and our 
respect for the right of students 

to make their own choices in such 
matters.”

Throughout the week’s dis-

cussions about the film and the 
University’s actions, Muslim and 
Arab students reported harass-
ment and death threats.

The 
University 
ultimately 

screened “American Sniper” and 
“Paddington” simultaneously at 
UMix.

The e-mails, which were sent 

by the student who launched a 
petition in April calling for the 
University to cancel the sched-
uled screening, said the coach 
was invited to talk with students 
about the screening “and get a 
dialogue going about how a uni-
versity leader’s social media can 
impact campus climate.”

Harbaugh 
has 
more 
than 

270,000 followers on Twitter, and 

his tweet about “American Sniper” 
was retweeted 31,775 times and 
favorited 38,305 times.

Approximately 
15 
students, 

Harper and Interim Athletic 
Director Jim Hackett attended 
the meeting Wednesday.

Administrators and student 

organizers requested the Daily 
not attend the meeting. All stu-
dents approached by the Daily 
following the meeting declined 
comment.

Harbaugh said, “It went great.”
In a follow-up e-mail to the 

Daily, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said there was good 
discussion and the coach is glad 
he was able to meet with the stu-
dents.

Supported 
by 
Gradecraft” 

received the largest grant from 
the program at $1.88 million. The 
project aims to develop a cur-
riculum that integrates gameplay 
through the software program 
GradeCraft.

Barry Fishman, who was a 

co-author of the Obama admin-
istration’s 2010 U.S. National 
Educational 
Technology 
Plan 

and is now a key researcher of the 
project, said the funding is allo-
cated toward implementing the 
program in classes across campus 
and teaching instructors how to 
use it in their classrooms.

Fishman said gameful learning 

gives the students the opportu-
nity to feel a stronger connection 
with the material they are learn-
ing.

“We use the term gameful to 

describe courses that are intend-
ed to maximize students’ feelings 
of autonomy — the ability to make 
choices about their learning that 
matter — a sense of belonging or 
being part of something larger 
than yourself and also support 
for students’ developing compe-
tence,” Fishman said. “Our team 
has been experimenting with 
gameful course designs for about 
five years now. We realized early 
on that such classes can be com-
plicated to manage — for both fac-
ulty and for students.”

Fishman said GradeCraft will 

manage the classes with their 
own unique approach.

“The centerpiece of GradeCraft 

is a tool we call the ‘Grade Predic-
tor,’ which is designed to support 
student autonomy by helping 
them visualize the possible ways 
a course can be completed suc-
cessfully,” Fishman said. “The 
tool enables students to actively 
experiment with which assign-

ments they will work on and visu-
alize the course grade they will 
earn as a result.”

The project aspires to create 

tenable innovation at the Univer-
sity. Fishman said he anticipates 
gameful learning and Game-
craft will be used in many places 
beyond the University.

“The University is unusual in 

that we manage to do so many dif-
ferent things well across such a 
broad range of areas, not least of 
which is teaching and learning,” 
Fishman said. “The entire Third 
Century program is a testament 
to how central educational inno-
vation is at Michigan. The GAME 
project and GradeCraft are just 
one example of how we continual-
ly work to reinvent the classroom 
experience. Gameful teaching is 
just one of many different class-
room innovations that will make 
an impact in the coming years.”

OPINION

FROM THE DAILY

Modifying the MIP

Legislation would transform the MIP into a civil infraction
T 

he proposed Senate Bill 332 would change underage posses-
sion of alcohol to a civil infraction. Referred to as a “minor in 
possession,” or an MIP, underage possession of alcohol is cur-

rently a misdemeanor crime. The bill would retain the fees associated 
with MIPs — up to $100 for the first violation and $200 for the second 
violation— and the third violation would then be considered a mis-
demeanor. However, the first and second violations would no longer 
involve jail time or a criminal record. Additionally, this bill would limit 
the ability of law enforcement officials to require breathalyzer tests 
from minors they have reasonable cause to believe have been drinking. 
Instead, law enforcement officials would only be able to request that 
minors submit to the exam. The benefits of this bill are clear. It would 
prevent young people from being denied scholarships, college admis-
sion and job opportunities because of a youthful mistake, and allow 
the re-allocation of resources currently being used to process MIPs in 
court. Although this bill would lessen the consequences for underage 
drinking, it retains enough consequences to be similarly preventative 
as the current law.

Senate Bill 332 was intro-

duced by Sen. Rick Jones (R–
Grand Ledge) in an effort to 
stop MIP cases from clogging 
criminal courts. Reducing MIP 
cases would allow for police 
officers, prosecutors and judg-
es to use their time for other 
more pressing concerns. Par-
ticularly, the legislation would 
allow police officers to work to 
make their communities safer 
and reduce the amount of time 
they need to spend as witnesses 
to these cases. However, some 
MIP cases would still be mis-
demeanors, such as those that 
include the purchase of alcohol 
using 
fraudulent 
identifica-

tion and any violations past the 
second civil infraction. This 
would prevent courts from 
being hindered but still demon-
strate that underage drinking 
is taken seriously. Addition-
ally, it should be noted that 
in 2013, the counties with the 
highest amounts of MIPs were 
all counties containing major 
public universities. Two of the 
top four counties are home to 
Michigan State University and 
the University of Michigan. 
Clearly, MIPs largely affect col-
lege students, who are partici-
pating in the widely accepted 
and practiced social activity.

Although underage drink-

ing is illegal, the current status 
is too harsh of a punishment to 
impose when the behavior is 
so prevalent on college cam-
puses. We need to ensure that 
those students caught break-
ing this law aren’t stuck with 
a criminal record and won’t be 
prohibited from student loans 
and scholarships as a result of 
this infraction. By doing so, 
the proposed legislation pro-
tects students’ futures from 
being permanently impacted 
by a short-term indiscretion. 
Rather than funnel students 
into the criminal justice sys-
tem, more educational efforts 
should be extended to curb 

S

itting on a yoga mat with our 
feet dangling over the edge of 
the dilapidated, wooden frame-

work of the balco-

dered the rapid-
ity with which the 
culmination 
of 

assignments, proj-
ects, all-nighters, 
exams and trips 
across 
the 
state 

had propelled us to 
the summer before 
our senior year of college. The boom-
ing strains of house music from across 
the street mingled with each laugh 
and anxious thought that infused the 
humid, summer night around us. We 
discussed everything from jobs to 
relocating to the shared sense of inde-
cisiveness we’d both need to overcome 
to eventually make these decisions. 
We delved deeper into the future, try-
ing to imagine separate timelines for 
all the goals and accomplishments we 
hoped were awaiting us in the loom-
ing expanse of uncertainty ahead.

Although the notion of strategiz-

ing and plotting out our lives may be 
appealing and offer some reassur-
ance, there’s absolutely no guaran-
tee that our prospective goals and 
achievements will occur in sync with 
some defined schedule we attempt to 
craft during our undergraduate years. 
Obstacles are inevitable. Extenuating 
circumstances may someday lead our 
personal and professional ambitions 
to conflict, forcing the prioritization 
of one over the other. For a great deal 
of women, the reality of this potential 
scenario is reinforced during discus-
sions about maintaining an effective 
balance between personal and profes-

sional life and trying to “have it all.”

An article by Liza Mundy in The 

Atlantic titled “Playing the Granny 
Card” suggests the recent surge of 
highly ambitious female politicians 
and officials — Hillary Clinton, Eliza-
beth Warren, Ruth Bader Ginsberg 
and Elizabeth Merkel to name a few— 
who are seeking or holding leadership 
positions of immense clout in their 
60s is due to the notion that women 
are “often held back in midlife by 
domestic responsibilities” and “are 
in many ways suited to shift into high 
gear at a later age.” Women — due to 
discrepancies between the methods 
by which they are evaluated in com-
parison to their male counterparts — 
assume positions at a more advanced 
age. While only 4.8 percent of Fortune 
500 CEOs are women, those who do 
eventually advance to the position are 
around the average age of 52.8 years 
old. The overwhelmingly larger por-
tion of male colleagues usually does 
so around the age of 50.2. The trend of 
older women in public office is further 
supported by the fact that the median 
age for female representatives in the 
U.S. House of Representatives is 59.1.

While it’s both extremely extraor-

dinary and inspiring to see that a 
woman’s ability to make a substantial 
impact upon society isn’t constricted 
by her age, the accompanying notion 
that female accomplishments may, 
then, need to be delayed until a wom-
an’s domestic duties are concluded — 
whatever she chooses those to be — is 
concerning. Some positions in cer-
tain fields, to an extent, will always 
require the immense knowledge and 
experience acquired by a practicing 
individual of an advanced age. Action, 
however, should be taken to assist

drinking behaviors in underage stu-
dents. Additionally, by diminishing 
the potential for punishment, the 
modified law may prevent students 
who may have already acquired an 
MIP from adopting more danger-
ous habits or re-locating drinking to 
unsafe settings simply out of a fear of 
facing further criminal consequences. 
As anti-drinking enforcement efforts 
increased on campus during Welcome 
Week this past year, for example, an 
increase of drinking behavior was 
seen in off-campus housing where 
these behaviors are far less monitored. 

Additionally, rather than instill-

ing students with a fear of incurring 
criminal charges, fines and a multi-
tude of potential future consequences, 
the legislation emphasizes the idea 

that drinking is largely a public health 
issue. More effort needs to be directed 
at advocating responsible and safe 
drinking habits in college communi-
ties. The bill — by removing the conse-
quences of criminal charges — removes 
deterrents that may prevent students 
from seeking medical assistance if 
a drinking problem does exist. Cur-
rently, a medical amnesty law exists in 
Michigan that protects any minor from 
receiving an MIP for seeking medical 
treatment for alcohol poisoning for 
either another minor or for themselves. 
However, if minors are unaware of 
this medical amnesty legislation, the 
diminished consequences offered by 
this bill could further reassure minors 
that they won’t face criminal charges 
solely for seeking treatment.

OPINION

Thursday, May 21, 2015

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The two coolest words in the 

English language are not “syner-
gistic globalization” or “real-time” 
or even “cellar door.” They may not 
be the most poetically underused 
or grammatically correct, but the 
words “space tech” represent some 
of the most exciting changes taking 
place around us in laboratories, uni-
versities and even high above the 
atmosphere, in outer space itself.

First, let’s talk about thrust. Most 

of the useful energy of a rocket 
launch goes toward putting the 
hunk of metal and plastic in Earth’s 
orbit — all the fire and explosions 
that accompany a SpaceX rocket 
aren’t present once you’re a few 
hundred kilometers up. At that 
point, satellites that intend to stick 
around use more passive forms of 
rocket propulsion powered not by 
chemicals, but often by clean, quiet 
electricity. Electric propulsion (EP 
for short) is what keeps our TV and 
communication satellites from fall-
ing out of their orbits with small 
controlled thrusts here and there 
carefully vectored through algo-
rithms. It isn’t very strong — exert-
ing forces comparable to the weight 
of only a few ounces — but very effi-
cient, often an order of magnitude 
more so than its chemical cousin.

As such, EP isn’t just for sup-

porting altitude — long range mis-
sions like the Voyager II, and more 
recently NASA JPL’s Dawn mission, 
use electric propulsion to traverse 
long distances by slowly, steadily 
building acceleration. Dawn uses 
a state of the art, electrically pow-
ered ion engine to explore two of 
the solar system’s largest asteroids: 
Vesta and Ceres. It’s the first human 
spacecraft to successfully orbit two 

celestial bodies over the course of 
one mission, and this feat was only 
made possible through the use of 
its specialized thruster. Here at the 
University, we have the Plasmady-
namics and Electric Propulsion Lab 
that is working on a number of EP 
projects, including the adaptation 
of electric propulsion to smaller and 
smaller satellites.

On top of propulsion technolo-

gies, research happens all the time 
in space. The International Space 
Station is an internationally run 
space station hanging in low Earth 
orbit. One of the major uses of the 
station is to study phenomena that 
normally wouldn’t be possible on 
Earth due to gravity. One of the 
more 
interesting 
experiments 

commonly performed involves the 
behavior of liquids in zero-g: enter 
the ISS espresso machine.

As any workaholic knows, caf-

feine is an essential part of staying 
focused when working after hours. 
Astronauts are no exception. The 
recent SpaceX launch brought a 
number of essential supplies to the 
space station, including the ISS’s 
very first espresso machine, which 
according to NASA, “may lead to 
new or improved brewing meth-
ods” when it is tested in micro-
gravity. The machine, referred to 
as “ISSpresso” also allows NASA 
to test their new beverage holder 
termed the “Capillary Beverage 
Study” which takes advantage 
of surface tension and other liq-
uid fluid phenomena to improve 
pouring in zero-g. (Try to imag-
ine pouring liquid into a cup when 
there is no ‘down’ established 
by gravity!)

Finally, let’s talk about the pas-

sion that the development of space 
technology inspires, even if it never 
makes it to orbit. Here at the Uni-
versity, a small team of students 
led by Engineering junior Rob 
Gitten is hard at work designing 
for humanity’s future in space. 
As part of NASA’s Revolution-
ary Aerospace Systems Concepts 
- Academic Linkage (RASC-AL) 
competition, this group has come 
up with a plan to build a 24-per-
son town on Mars. The mission 
relies on space tech both old and 
new, utilizing both SpaceX’s reus-
able rocket technology and NASA’s 
more conservative space launch 
system. The RASC-AL team met 
every year and recently presented 
their proposal at a meeting of the 
American Institute of Aeronautics 
and Astronautics. With the dedica-
tion of true Wolverines, they are 
working for a day when humanity 
has a new home in the sky.

Opportunities 
like 
RASC-AL 

bring to light many of the positive 
impacts space-oriented technol-
ogy has both on the scientists and 
engineers who design it and the 
people, like you or I, whose lives 
are infinitely improved by it. Satel-
lites bring us pictures of our planet 
and others, opening our eyes to the 
splendor of the cosmos and our 
place within it. Rockets by their 
very nature inspire dreams, and 
technology, such as electric propul-
sion, is the reality of those dreams 
— the end product of what might 
have started out merely as ‘what if.’ 
And coffee in space is pretty cool no 
matter which way you spin it.

advancing to the top sectors in 
their field.

At the outset of their careers, 

women are almost on par with 
the men. Young women — as they 
begin their professional careers 
between the ages of 25 and 34 — 
earn roughly 90 percent of what 
their male counterparts earn. 
Soon afterwards, the wage dispar-
ity between the sexes expands as 
women age. This aggravation of 
the gap leads to women between 
the age of 45 and 54 earning only 
around 76 per-
cent of what 
their male col-
leagues 
earn, 

according 
to 

the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor Statis-
tics. As women 
approach 
motherhood, 
the need for 
flexibility and 
reduced work hours increases. 
Likewise, studies published in 
both the Journal of Social Issues 
and in the American Journal 
of Sociology found that moth-
ers were perceived as possessing 
lower levels of competence in the 
workplace, a perception that can 
hinder a woman’s progress in the 
professional realm.

Negotiation between working 

and caring for children is a deci-
sion women will likely consider as 
they choose to begin having fami-
lies. However, one initial step to, at 
the very least, reduce the possibil-
ity women will have to delay their 
professional or financial ambi-
tions due to domestic obligations 
is to improve the nation’s current 
stance on paid maternity leave.

Pregnancy and maternity leave 

are issues that may never affect 
some women’s professional lives, 
and at the moment, it’s a situa-
tion that’s extremely distant from 
the mindsets of my friends and 
me. However, as young women 
enter the workforce and the topic 
begins to enter the realm of pos-
sibility more and more, prospec-
tive maternity concerns become 
an influential force on whether or 
not specific career steps are taken. 
Due to the fact the Family and 
Medical Leave Act only requires 
employers to offer 12 weeks of 
unpaid leave once an employee has 

worked at an institution for a full 
year, many women may neglect 
switching jobs, or even seeking a 
promotion, if there’s the slight-
est possibility they could become 
pregnant in the near future.

Currently, the United States 

severely lags behind in the assis-
tance it offers to women who 
recently gave birth. It’s the only 
developed nation that neglects 
to offer paid maternity leave to 
new mothers, and the United 
States and Papua New Guinea are 

the only two 
nations in the 
world that fail 
to do so. New 
mothers — in 
an attempt to 
balance 
both 

caring 
for 

their child and 
maintaining 
their 
profes-

sional 
goals 

— often try to aggregate a combi-
nation of sick days and vacation 
days in addition to their limited 
allotment of leave days to counter-
act this insufficiency. 

By refusing to offer paid mater-

nity leave, the U.S. is neglecting a 
widely accepted practice capable of 
alleviating some of the financial and 
professional constraints women 
face as they become new mothers.

For women trying to plan their 

futures, the desire to adequately 
maintain their professional and 
personal ambitions is a task that’s 
bound to be met with a certain 
degree of difficulty. While the cur-
rent outlook illustrates a promising 
future where women can continue 
to make significant contributions 
to society even in the latter half of 
their lives, potential motherhood 
shouldn’t immediately signify a 
regression in their careers. Yes, 
the respective balancing act will 
someday be very difficult for a mul-
titude of women, and it will be due 
to a variety of factors, one of which 
is the lack of paid maternity leave. 
However, when one factor is known 
to financially and professionally 
constrain new mothers and has 
been remedied time and time again 
by numerous nations, why would 
we not strive to change it?

Sandall recounts 

her journey into the 

fashion business

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Senior Arts Editor

Before 
Ashley-Brooke 
Sandall 

began 
her 
fashionable 
career 

trajectory, she was a mondaine 
Metro-Detroiter with an affinity 
for all things Pucci and Prada. Born 
to two University graduates and 
brought up in Ann Arbor, Sandall’s 
choice to attend the University, 
where 
she 
graduated 
with 
a 

Communications degree in 2003, 
is understandable. Considering her 
former-model mother usually picked 
her up from school rocking brazen 
Missoni jumpsuits, it’s unsurprising 
Sandall developed a fondness for 
fashion that continues to punctuate 
her professional path — one that 
began with an internship at Prada 
and extends to her current position 
as the senior manager of strategic 
partnerships for the Council of 
Fashion Designers of America, replete 
with enviable experiences at high-
profile luxury brands in between.

Aware of the sartorial sphere’s 

competitive nature, the ever-prudent 
Sandall developed a strategy for 
securing ambitious internships.

“I applied for my internship by 

selling myself on the more traditional 
education that I was getting in order 
to differentiate myself from the 
fashion students,” she said. “I was 
obviously competing against kids 
who went to FIT and other fashion 
schools.”

Fashion-focused 
clubs 
and 

publications were virtually non-
existent during Sandall’s collegiate 
years, prompting her to carve out 
a curriculum through internships 
and seasonal retail jobs. During the 
summer months, while her family 
vacationed in Northern Michigan, 
Sandall took a retail position at 
Harbor Springs’ premier menswear 
retailer, selling Ralph Lauren Black 
Label to the genteel gentlemen of the 
city.

“I’ve always been a fan of 

menswear, true tailoring and how 
men are much more loyal consumers,” 
she said. “Women are very fickle.”

That partiality for menswear 

complemented her first job with 
John Varvatos, a contemporary men’s 
designer with an eponymous label. 
When Varvatos was emerging on 
the design scene, Sandall learned of 
his Michigan roots during one of his 
personal appearances at Barney’s. 
Though a New-York-based brand, 
Varvatos integrates his Midwestern 
sensibility into the line, something 
that attracted Sandall. She kept in 
touch with the designer and received 
a job offer two months prior to her 
graduation.

“A large part of my job at John 

Varvatos was to do personal shopping 
for not only celebrities, but also 
notable New York financiers,” she 
said. 

When one of Sandall’s clients 

was planning to invest in Stuart 
Weitzman and build a reputable 
team, he suggested she join. Eager 
to experience the business side of 
fashion in a new work environment, 
she accepted the offer.

“I love John Varvatos and it was 

very hard for me to leave, but I wanted 
to transition into something that was 
a bit more business-minded,” she said. 
“I worked on sales and marketing 
and expanding the brand into other 
categories.”

Throughout her two years at 

Weitzman, Sandall’s primary role 
was to update the brand and attract 
a younger demographic in the 
process. She then transitioned into 
the publishing world, working within 
American Express’s fashion and 
jewelry sectors of the Centurian and 
Platinum card magazines.

At American Express, she dabbled 

in event planning and generated 
marketing programs for some of the 
most iconic luxury brands — Chanel, 
Balenciaga, Mikimoto and Harry 
Winston, to name a few. Sandall also 
planned client-specific events and 
private dinners for the most affluent 
customers, among which included 
those who fly on NetJets thrice 
annually, and/or those who spend at 
least $1,000,000 on ready-to-wear 
collections.

“It was an incredible experience,” 

she said.

When Sandall’s boss at American 

Express eventually resigned, he 
was planning a career segue to the 
CFDA, when she was, yet again, 

highly encouraged to continue on her 
winning streak in the game of follow 
the corporate leader. She seemed to 
be a perfect fit for the organization of 
America’s leading fashion designers, 
seeing as she had a past at both John 
Varvatos and Stuart Weitzman, two 
CFDA members.

“I followed him over and it was 

the most amazing thing that’s ever 
happened to me,” she recalled.

According to their website, the 

CFDA exists as a nonprofit trade 
association 
whose 
membership 

consists of more than 400 of 
America’s foremost womenswear, 
menswear, jewelry and accessory 
designers. At the intersection of 
high-fashion and charity, the agency 
assists nascent designers within 
their incubator program, along with 
serving as a benefactor of fashion 
scholarships for students.

“I think the best part is definitely 

being part of an organization that 
makes such a difference in fashion, 
even if people aren’t familiar with 
the CFDA or don’t really know us 
outside of awards,” Sandall said. “It’s 
one of the most glamorous events in 
fashion, but I’m still on the job when 
attending.”

The 
organization 
hosts 
their 

namesake awards annually, often 
nicknamed “The Oscars of Fashion.” 
The event recognizes the industry’s 
talented 
legacies 
and 
evolving 

designers alike, along with celebrity 
style-icons 
(last 
year, 
Rihanna 

snagged the Fashion Icon Award), 
and, of course, famously showcases 
fashion. In preparation for the 
awards, Sandall seeks out sponsorship 
opportunities, along with creating 
proposals and activation ideas.

As the current senior manager 

of strategic partnerships for the 
association, 
Sandall’s 
days 
are 

packed — often meeting with council 
members, potential partners and 
designers. She also routinely attends 
evening events, namely cocktail 
parties and store openings, an aspect 
she admittedly enjoys.

Though 
an 
Ann-Arborite-

turned-New Yorker, Sandall said 
she primarily identifies as a self-
described steadfast Wolverine.

“Within the first few minutes of 

meeting me, I’ll probably mention the 
fact that I went to the University of 
Michigan.”

Halestorm: a 
review in ‘fucks’

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Managing Arts Editor

Tuesday 
May 
19, 
2015, 

Halestorm and The Pretty Reck-
less played The Whiting in Flint 
(there was an opening-opening act 
which I missed, you know, because 
fashionably late. Curse me when 
they are the headliner I am wait-
ing for two years from now). These 
two female-led rock bands killed 
the 2015 Carnival of Madness tour 
in typical rock style. There were 
booming drums, head-banging gui-
tar riffs, lots of eyeliner and a few 
shots of jäger. If it is any testament 
to the show, my ears are still ring-
ing after the hour-plus drive home. 
And in true rock ‘n’ roll style, I have 
a “fuck yes” and a “fuck you” list.

Fuck yes to the venue for actual-

ly having its own parking lot. Fuck 
yes to my BFF for coming, even 
though she didn’t know a single 
song. Fuck yes to Little Caesars for 
having a pre-concert dinner in my 
price range. Fuck yes to my BFF for 
finally urinating somewhere other 
than a toilet (in the aforementioned 
parking lot, to be specific). Fuck yes 
for the venue for not checking our 
bags. I needed that in-between set 
drink and ho ho to get me through. 
Fuck yes to Connie, the woman next 
to me, for showing up by herself and 
having a damn good time. Fuck yes 
to The Pretty Reckless. They didn’t 
play my favorite song, but I rocked 
out and head-banged to their entire 
set as if it was my favorite (shoutout 
to my BFF for having a hair tie to 
keep my hair out of my mouth as I 
head-banged). Fuck yes to this show 
for giving me a reason to unironi-
cally use the “rock on” hand sign I 

usually reserve for snapchats. Fuck 
yes to the parents who brought out 
their young children to experience 
some amazing music, even if it was 
simply because they couldn’t find 
a sitter. Fuck yes to Halestorm for 
bringing their A-game to Flint, 
Michigan (their home away from 
home, as they said multiple times). 
Fuck yes to them making me love 
a couple songs I didn’t even like. 
They were amazing live. Fuck yes 
to security for letting me sneak my 
way up to the front row during the 
encore and get as close as possible 
to the band. And a final fuck yes to 
my BFF who smiled at me as I left 
her in our seats to jam up close.

And for the fuck yous: Fuck you 

to my cheap nail polish for chipping 
an hour after I did it. Fuck you to 
the man on the other side of us who 
gave dirty looks for the two (TWO) 
times I bumped into him over the 
three-hour period (it’s a rock show, 
calm down). Fuck you to the cheap 
Forever 21 bracelet for flying off my 
hand and into the crowd ... good 
riddance, I guess. Fuck you to the 
man in front of me for inappropri-
ately touching his companion for 
the better (worse?) part of the show; 
save it for after, pal. Fuck you, Lzzy 
Hale, for handing the guitar pick 
to the hand next to mine during the 
encore (jk, I love you a lot).

Clearly none of my “fuck yous” 

were the fault of the band. Well, 
besides the guitar pick, but I 
won’t hold it against them. And 
as one final thank you: Thank you 
Halestorm for bringing “Mayhem” 
into what would’ve been a boring 
Tuesday night, and taking my rock 
show virginity. It is something I 
will never regret nor forget.

‘Mad Men’ says good-
bye after seven seasons

TV REVIEW

Final Episode 

leaves unanswered 

questions

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

Rest in peace, Don Draper.
During his last appearance in the 

“Mad Men” series finale, Don Drap-
er (Jon Hamm, “30 
Rock”) is at peace. 
His eyes are closed 
and his mouth rests 
in an uncharacter-
istic smile. The col-
lection of roles and 
jobs that bound him 
to his harsh New 
York lifestyle — husband, father, 
mentor and hotshot advertising 
executive — barely register on his 
still face. He is still alive and breath-
ing, but Don Draper is dead.

One of the major themes run-

ning throughout “Mad Men” is the 
malleability of identity. When Dick 
Whitman pulls the dog tags off his 
friend’s corpse and returns home 
from the Korean War with a new 
name, he’s abandoning the bag-
gage of his traumatic childhood and 
becoming, quite literally, another 
person. He is a chameleon, chang-
ing who he is to fit the demands 
of the new job and life he chooses 
for himself. And he is not the only 
one: The Peggy Olson (Elisabeth 
Moss, “The West Wing”) of Season 
7 couldn’t be more different from 
the demure and impressionable sec-
retary we met in the first episode. 
“Mad Men” allowed all of its char-
acters to change and shift course 
countless times during its seven-
season run — to rise, fall, relapse, 
live, die and come back again.

As her friendship with Don has 

cooled, Peggy is flourishing with 
independence. While Don runs 
away from all his problems, Peggy 
confronts hers head-on. She’s thriv-
ing at McCann Erickson, poised 
to become the next Don and even 
more. However, she still harbors a 
soft spot in her heart for the mentor 
who gave her the spark of hope for 
something more than secretarial 
work. And as distant as Don could 
be, his relationship with Peggy was 
one of his most genuine and mean-

ingful. In a despairing moment late 
in the episode, Don calls Peggy, 
remembering that he never said 
goodbye to her in person. He con-
fesses his sins: Hunched over the 
payphone with anguished eyes, 
mentor seeks comfort from men-
tee. Peggy reminds him that he has 
a home and a family to come back 
to — a work family, but that doesn’t 
make it any less real. Moss and 
Hamm deliver some of their best 
performances of the entire series, 
and the scene aches with the pathos 
of their shared desperation.

Immediately 
after 
this 
call, 

Peggy gets another from Stan Rizzo 
(Jay Ferguson, “The Lucky One”), 
who suddenly confesses his love 
to her. It’s a bizarre development, 
considering that their relationship 
always read as mutually respectful 
and supportive — never romantic. 
When Peggy realizes that she might 
have feelings for him, too, and he 
bursts into her office to kiss her, the 
scene is almost too good to be true. 
Historically, “Mad Men” has taken 
a cynical approach to love, and with 
so little evidence for Peggy and Stan, 
their passionate smooch comes off a 
bit too pat to be believable.

Don Draper doesn’t want to 

choose between work and life. He’s 
had his share of both — seven sea-
sons of brilliant advertising pitches 
and late nights in the office and 
a few months’ worth of aimless 
wandering and drunken brooding. 
When he arrives in Los Angeles 
and ends up at the hippie retreat, 
Don is already looking the part of 
Dick Whitman, wearing his hair 
in a boyish side part and donning 

some rugged denim jackets that 
are uncharacteristic of the ad exec 
persona he left behind in New York. 
But he outgrows those clothes at the 
retreat: He explores a new part of 
his identity entirely separate from 
Dick and Don. He has a sincere 
moment of connection with a man 
who describes feeling insubstan-
tial, more like a can in a refrigera-
tor than an actual human man with 
a wife and children who love him. 
Don knows this feeling of empti-
ness well. Despite the fact that he’s 
offered glimpses of vulnerability to 
his children and to Peggy, he won-
ders if there is even a man under 
the disguises he’s grown so used to 
wearing.

He buries Dick and Don in 

the California sand and emerg-
es a new man, eyes closed and 
legs crossed and meditating. 
He smiles, offering viewers a 
quick glimpse at the man he has 
become. Then the screen cuts 
to a Coca-Cola advertisement, 
which Don might have created if 
he went back to McCann Erick-
son.

The show doesn’t provide a 

definitive answer if he actually 
created the ad. All we are left 
with is the image of a peace-
ful smile and a group of people 
singing about love, harmony and 
human connection. It’s a beau-
tifully ambiguous ending to a 
show that always challenged its 
viewers to question and engage 
and to impart their own mean-
ing on every episode. Don is 
a blank slate and it’s up to us 
to determine his new identity.

‘Pitch Perfect’ 
sequel: off-key

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

Hold what you love to a high 

standard.

The acting, spearheaded by Anna 

Kendrick (“Up 
in the Air”) as 
the irresistibly 
not-so-alt Beca 
Mitchell, 
was 

charming 
and 

lighthearted. 
Kendrick 
hit 

her notes. The 
music 
was 

groovy. 
But 

“Pitch 
Perfect 

2” won’t make you feel happy like 
an old-time movie because the 
direction hit somewhere between 
amateurish and hand-me-a-drink 
awful, with insidious gags and hurt-
ful tropes suffocating the cast. First-
time feature director Elizabeth 
Banks went for the low-hanging 
fruit, and the film never found its 
sound. The project of “Pitch Per-
fect 2” presented weird and glori-
ous opportunities; we really needed 
Banks to step up here. Musical com-
edy deserves better than ironic cari-
catures.

The Bellas, our a cappella heroes, 

find themselves in a graphically 
embarrassing situation and spend 
the rest of the movie recovering. 
The long-term objective is clear-
ly outlined, and the once-again 
underdogs wander towards victory 
without serious conflict. A sense of 
community redeems our troupe. 
The message of power in voice and 
friendship is parodied and under-
mined by a giggling carelessness in 
execution. The supporting actress-
es’ identities are little more than 
running gags.

Rebel Wilson — playing “Fat 

Amy” — does her damnedest to 
make her character a complex per-
son. Her fearlessness in spite of 
scorn — both in-universe and from 
the audience — is phenomenal, but 
in her grand romantic denouement, 
she’s directed to present herself 
more as “Fat” than as “Amy”, as 
though overweight people’s rela-
tionships can never be more than a 
joke. Sure, the franchise gets points 
for including her at all, but it’s not 
a win when the primary cinematic 
value of a token character is ostensi-

bly their tokenhood.

This problem is redoubled in 

the case of the Black lesbian whose 
name we forget, the over-sexualized 
girl whose name we forget, the qui-
etly psycho Asian girl whose name 
we forget and the cute illegal immi-
grant girl whose name we forget, 
who constantly makes jokes about 
how horrifying life ACTUALLY 
IS for REAL PEOPLE in REAL 
PLACES in the REAL WORLD. And 
this is a light comedy? No, this is a 
dark comedy. You might not notice, 
because everyone is smiling and 
adorable. But damn, the darkness.

It’s 
Alanis-Morissette-ironic, 

dwelling in that coincidental pov-
erty of humor: the vagina flash, the 
lesbian hilariously turned on by 
sharing a tent with her straight girl-
friends, the Mexican student joking 
about deportation. But these sour 
notes can’t touch Kendrick, who 
carries the film. Kendrick’s inter-
actions with the German a capella 
group, Das Sound Machine, are 
deliciously awkward, touched with 
a confused sexual tension that has 
the audience cooing, and Keegan-
Michael Key owns every scene he’s 
a part of, his effervescence legiti-
mizing the absurd cameo of Snoop 
Dogg.

But the dramatic turns feel 

forced. There’s an underground 
pajama party staged just to give 
“Pitch Perfect 2” an opportunity 
to represent musically the way 
“Pitch Perfect” did, and even 
worse, when the Bellas go away 
to a camp to rediscover “their 
sound”, the atmosphere of the 
bonding is disappointingly low-
intensity, as though the director 
only noticed three-quarters of the 
way through the movie that the 
script saw insufficient conflict. 
The door of the film is left open for 
a sequel, but Kendrick’s intended 
replacement, Emily (Hailee Stein-
feld, “True Grit”) doesn’t have the 
stage presence to fill Kendrick’s 
shoes, despite Steinfeld’s organic 
puppy romance with the adork-
able Benji (Ben Platt, “Pitch Per-
fect”).

We adore this franchise, but 

we wanted the full wit and power 
of these ladies to leave us aca-
stounded. Even if the magic of 
the music glimmered through, the 
greater whole was a hot mess.

-phal (D–Ward 2).

Councilmember Sumi Kaila-

sapathy (D–Ward 1) provided an 
update on the Ann Arbor Human 
Rights 
Commission’s 
Subcom-

mittee on Civilian Police Over-
sight, which had been tasked with 
determining whether or not an 
oversight board for the city’s police 
force is necessary.

The 
subcommittee 
decided 

unanimously that an oversight 
board needs to be established, 
although the specific title or 
model of implementation still 
needs to be developed.

“They knew there was a real 

need, and parts of the population 
that were concerned, … I really 
appreciate their work, and Ann 
Arbor residents appreciate what 
they have done,” Kailasapathy 
said.

During the public comments 

portion of the meeting, six 
speakers expressed support for 
the Allen Creek Greenway mas-
ter plan. This plan proposes the 
creation of a path for pedestrians 
and bicycles along the alignment 
of Allen Creek and the defunct 
Ann Arbor Railroad.

The Greenway would contribute 

to recreational green space for the 
downtown area and its surround-
ing neighborhoods while improv-
ing flood control watershed quality. 
Support for the concept dates back 
to the 1980s.

Another issue raised by Ann 

Arbor residents during pub-
lic commentary regarded deer 
management. Speakers urged 
the council to allow the Humane 
Society to assess the Ann Arbor 
area and provide a recommen-
dation before moving forward 
to reduce numbers in the deer 
population through culls.

Former Michigan star 

returns home after 

rookie season

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

Judging by the 15 bottles of 

hot sauce lined up on his kitchen 
countertop, Nik Stauskas is either 
a burgeoning chef or an NBA rook-
ie endorsed by Musashi Foods.

After a closed-captioning error 

referred to Stauskas as “Sauce 
Castillo” in March, the Sacramen-
to Kings guard has experienced 
a whirlwind of attention sur-
rounding his infectious nickname. 
There are shirts dedicated to the 
mishap, and he even has his own 
line of Sauce Castillo hot sauce 
through Musashi.

He not only didn’t see the nick-

name coming, but he’s not even a 
fan of legitimate, spicy hot sauce. 
After getting over the initial 
weirdness, though, he was able to 
embrace it.

“I was so confused, I didn’t 

really get it,” Stauskas said. “It 
happened during the game, so 
I didn’t really figure it out until 
afterwards on Twitter because 
everyone was Tweeting at me like, 
‘Good game, Sauce.’

“The first time I heard it, I thought 

it was a little weird. I didn’t love it. 
Once I saw how much everyone else 
liked it though, I was like, ‘You know 
what, I might as well roll with it.’ ”

The moniker followed him every-

where on the road, where fans 
shouted “Sauce” at him rather than 
Nik, and his teammates stopped 
calling him Nik altogether.

With the nickname came more 

confidence.

“It was almost like an alter-ego 

type of thing, which I enjoyed, like 
going on the court and playing as 
someone else and just having fun 
with it.”

Both the nickname and the sauce 

have followed him back to Ann Arbor 
(fans can now buy his mild sauce at 
The M Den and even meet “Sauce 
Castillo” on June 5 from 6-8pm in 
the store), where he’s training with 
Michigan basketball strength and 
conditioning coach Jon Sanderson 
for the summer.

Two years ago, Stauskas spent the 

summer with just Sanderson and 
Caris LeVert. He believes the sum-
mer following his freshman season 
changed his body, and the results 
showed.

His sophomore season, Staus-

kas increased his average points 
per game by six points to become 
Michigan’s leading scorer at 17 
points per game. Expanding his 
role from shooting specialist to 
team leader, Stauskas also sur-
prised many by winning Big Ten 
Player of the Year.

He attributes those gains to 

Sanderson’s emphasis on build-
ing body mass and adding size. 
Sanderson, a former Ohio State 
basketball player, has six years of 
coaching at Michigan under his 

belt, and he believes in the basics 
of weightlifting to get players to 
reach their full potential.

Stauskas decided to return to 

his old stomping grounds when 
Sanderson called him in the 
beginning of March — before the 
Sauce Castillo madness began — 
about training in Ann Arbor for 
the summer.

“Coach Sanderson just called 

me randomly out of nowhere,” 
Stauskas said. “He was just like, 
‘Man, you’ve gotta come back to 
Ann Arbor, we’re going to have 
a big summer and we’re going 
to work really hard.’ The more I 
thought of it, the more it made 
sense to me. Just being back where 
I’m comfortable, working with 
people I know, it just all seemed 
like a pretty good idea.”

He also returned to work with 

Greg Harden, the Director of 
Athletic Counseling at Michigan. 
Harden, who has worked with 
Tom Brady, Desmond Howard and 
Michael Phelps, specializes on the 
mental aspects of the game.

Stauskas values the psychologi-

cal facets of athletics as much as 
the physical, so the joint effort 
made the choice to return to cam-
pus easy.

Along with working with those 

he’s already familiar with, Staus-
kas has also gotten to know the 
younger players on the current 
Michigan squad, and his eyebrows 
raise and eyes widen when talking 
about next season’s potential.

“I’m in the weight room with 

them every day, so it’s just good to 
be around those guys,” Stauskas 
said. “They make me work harder 
and I make them work harder.

“I think next season is going to 

be big, especially if they can get 
everyone back and healthy. It’s 
going to be a tough team to face. 
Now the team has been together 
for a little while, and I think next 
year is going to be a good year.”

After making the jump from 

being 
an 
unheralded 
college 

recruit to a lottery draft pick in 
the NBA, his former teammates 
have bought into the importance 
of summer conditioning.

“It’s crazy to see how far the 

spring and summer sessions have 
come for the Michigan basketball 
team,” Stauskas said. “Two years 
ago, when Caris and I stayed for the 
spring, we were like the only ones 
staying to work out with Sanderson, 
and now, virtually the whole team 
is here working out with Sander-
son every day. Everyone is here and 
wants to put in the work.”

Among those is sophomore Dun-

can Robinson, who will be eligible 
this upcoming season after sitting 
out last season due to NCAA trans-
fer rules. Before even playing one 
official minute for the Wolverines, 
people are already trying to com-
pare him to Stauskas.

The comparisons might not be 

completely unheralded, though.

“(Duncan Robinson) can really 

shoot,” Stauskas said. “We need to 
schedule something. He might even 
beat me — at least that’s what the 

guys have been telling me.”

After taking just two weeks off, 

Stauskas has returned to his roots, 
and he’s not afraid of the competition 
the younger players might bring.

Though Stauskas only averaged 

15.4 minutes per game for the 
Kings, a measly number compared 
to the 35.8 minutes he averaged 
in his final year at Michigan, the 
demanding travel schedule still 
took its toll on the rookie.

But even after he adjusted to the 

professional lifestyle, the higher 
level of competition was unlike 
any physical challenge Stauskas 
had ever faced. He averaged 4.4 
points per game — far from how 
he wanted his rookie season to go.

After being the big man on cam-

pus just a year before and hav-
ing attention from even the most 
casual of Michigan fans, he strug-
gled to get noticed in Sacramento.

“I think the toughest thing for 

me, as far as transition goes, was 
just the physicality of the game,” 
Stauskas said. “Guys are six, 
seven, eight years older than me 
a lot of the time and they’re just 
grown men, they have 10, 15, 20 
pounds on me. Just putting on the 
extra size will help me with a lot 
of confidence and help me battle 
harder out there.”

Whether he makes those gains 

from the extra time he puts in the 
gym or from a “Sauce Castillo”-
heavy diet (he enjoys it with 
grilled chicken the most), he 
hopes an Ann Arbor summer will 
lead him to success once again.

Rowing comes in 
second at Big Ten’s

By ALEX KHALIFEH 

Daily Sports Writer

Don’t look too far into the simi-

larities between this group and last 
year’s.

Though the No. 11 Michigan 

women’s rowing team finished with 
the same overall result as it did in 
last year’s Big Ten Tournament — a 
second-place finish to top-ranked 
Ohio State — the end results in the 
particular races had different, and in 
some cases better, outcomes.

Take the Wolverines’ second var-

sity eight, for example.

Unlike last year, when Michigan’s 

crew finished in second place behind 
Ohio State, the Wolverines bested 
the Buckeyes this time around, win-
ning the Big Ten title for the second 
varsity eight.

“I just know all of the hard work 

the girls in that boat have put in,” said 
senior Alex Spaulding.

“They were down nine seconds to 

Ohio State, and then up on them four. 
… It was just super motivating and I 
think it really set the tone that any-
thing is possible. … I was so excited 
for them, and it was a really special 
win for them and the team.”

The second varsity eight title is the 

first for the Wolverines since 2012.

In the first varsity eight, Michigan 

placed second behind Ohio State, 
separated by a mere 2.782 seconds. 
Though the Wolverines played a 

neck-and-neck race, Indiana put a 
scare into Michigan, as the Hoosiers 
conjured up a late rally in the final 
500 meters before the Wolverines 
were able to hold Indiana off and 
secure second place.

Despite not being able to take 

home the Big Ten title in their 
respective event, the first varsity 
eight crew were pleased to notice the 
improvements against the Buckeyes 
since their previous matchup just 
last month.

“We’re really excited going into 

nationals,” said Spaulding. “The 
margin (Ohio State) had on us a few 
weeks ago was cut in half. We know 
we have another chance at them at 
NCAAs, so we’re excited about it.”

The first novice eight faced a dif-

ficult time during its event, finishing 
fifth overall, while the second varsi-
ty four and third varsity four placed 
third and fourth, respectively.

After the tournament ended, 

Spaulding along with seniors Jes-
sica Eiffert and Hannah Sherman 
were honored with All-Big Ten team 
recognition. Senior Allison Boss was 
also recognized for the Sportsman-
ship Award.

“It’s actually incredible,” said 

Spaulding. “It’s super humbling and 
kind of surreal. It was something 
that I kind of dreamt of (along with) 
being in the (first varsity eight). It’s 
a super big honor and I’m really 
happy about it.”

Softball ready for Bulldogs 

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

Last year, the Michigan soft-

ball failed to make the Women’s 
College World Series. It lost in 
the Super Regionals — the round 
the Wolverines are heading into 
Thursday. But this is a different 
team. This is a different year, a 
different opponent.

No. 3 Michigan (54-6 overall) 

isn’t worried or thinking about 
last season’s shortcoming. It 
replaces the fear that could be 
there with confidence.

“We might be facing better 

talent (this week compared to 
previous weeks) and everything,” 
said freshman first baseman Tera 
Blanco. “But if we stick to us and 
stick to what we do, I think we’re 
going to be fine.”

Added sophomore right-hand-

er Megan Betsa: “We’re stick-
ing to our normal routine. We’re 
doing everything the exact same 
that we would do if it was some-
one else.”

This year’s Super Regional 

opponent is the No. 14 seed of the 
NCAA Division 1 Softball Tour-
nament, Georgia (44-15). The 
Bulldogs finished sixth in the 
loaded SEC Conference, but lead 
it in batting average (.346) and 
stolen bases (122). Georgia’s posi-
tion at both categories proves its 
proficiency at contact hitting and 
running well on the base paths.

“Their 
offense 
is 
pretty 

strong,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “They’ve got 
great hitters, they’ve got team 
speed. You know they’re going to 
be dangerous and they’re going to 

be really aggressive.”

Hutchins 
emphasized 
how 

the top two hitters of the lineup, 
right fielder Sydni Emanuel and 
second baseman Alex Hugo, are 
threats with their skills at the 
plate. Emanuel and Hugo are in 
the top 15 in their conference 
in batting average with .429 
and .403 marks, respectively. 
Hugo leads the SEC in slugging 
percentage by a wide margin, 
maintaining a .918 clip.

The Bulldogs’ pitching staff 

is not too shabby either, hold-
ing a 2.04 earned-run average. 
Taking over most of the starts 
is right-hander Chelsea Wilkin-
son. Wilkinson has a 1.95 ERA 
and leads her conference with 28 
wins and 262 strikeouts. Being 
a strikeout artist like Betsa, the 
matchup between the two right-
handers will be a highly antici-
pated one.

“(Coach 
Brundage) 
wants 

me to shoot for 21 strikeouts, 
so that’s what I’m gonna do 
this weekend,” Betsa said. “I’m 
gonna try to strike out 21 people. 
But it may not happen, and that’s 
something I’m gonna have to be 
okay with if it doesn’t happen. 
My mentality is going to stay the 
same. I’m a strikeout pitcher and 
that’s what I’m going to do.”

Hutchins wants Betsa to have 

this attitude, stressing that the 
pitching staff will be of high 
importance this round.

“We have to attack them 

because they’re going to attack 
us,” Hutchins said. “We can’t 
pitch around them and we can’t 
be tentative. Because if the 
pitchers are tentative, our team 

will be tentative.”

But the Wolverines are any-

thing but tentative at this point. 
They’re ready to punch their tick-
et to Oklahoma City. Hutchins 
said that there are 16 teams 
left out of around 300. And she 
emphasized that these 16 are not 
necessarily the best, but are play-
ing the best right now. This spot 
is earned and couldn’t have been 
earned with tentativeness.

“This is the bottom line, I don’t 

know if this is proper to say, but 
it’s kill or be killed,” Hutchins 
said. “You show up and play, 
you show up and attack, or be 
attacked. So you’re either going to 
win, or you’re going to lose. You 
can’t be afraid of it. The minute 
you’re afraid you might not go to 
Oklahoma City, I guarantee you 
won’t go.”

Michigan isn’t scared. It isn’t 

worried about how fast Wilkin-
son’s fastball is going to be, or if 
Hugo will take a pitch deep. The 
Wolverines are rather confident 
in how their own pitching staff 
is going to throw well, and how 
everyone in the lineup will con-
tribute when called upon.

Team 38 isn’t Team 37. That 

doesn’t mean that this year’s team 
is better or more confident than 
the one before it. It just means that 
the teams are different. Each team 
has faced different obstacles. For 
Team 38, there’s no fear that last 
year’s history will be repeated.

“We’re not going to be afraid,” 

Hutchins said. “That’s something 
we have to control. Fear creeps 
into everybody’s mind, and that’s 
something you have to throw out 
the window and start slugging.”

Season on the line as 
baseball heads to the 
Big T
en T
ournament

By ZACH SHAW 

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan baseball team is 

playing some of its best baseball in 
years.

The rest of the conference, how-

ever, has followed suit.

The 2015 Big Ten Baseball Tour-

nament is set to begin in Minneap-
olis Wednesday in what will be one 
of the most competitive conference 
tournaments in the country.

For the first time ever, the Big 

Ten will send six teams inside the 
nation’s top 50 rankings to the 
eight-team event. The six Big Ten 
teams is a number only bested 
by the Southeastern and Atlantic 
Coast Conferences, which each 
boast eight such teams

Despite having their most wins 

since 2010 and earning the No. 3 
seed, the Wol-
verines — who 
kick off the 
tournament 
against 
Indi-

ana at 10 a.m. 
eastern 
time 

Wednesday — 
aren’t one of 
those teams.

In 
fact, 

Michigan (14-
10 
Big 
Ten, 

33-23 overall) finds itself dead-
last in Ratings Percentage Index, 
which factors in win percentage 
and strength of schedule. Despite 
being on the outside looking in, 
momentum has been building for 
the Wolverines.

“It’s been an upward slope 

ever since I got here,” said senior 
infielder Eric Jacobson. “We’ve 
gotten better and better every time 
and the program is on the rise. 
We’ve got a resilient bunch and a 
confident bunch, and I think that 
bodes well for the postseason.”

Michigan finished conference 

play with a 7-2 record, and recently 
showcased its postseason poten-
tial by toppling No. 13 Oklahoma 
State on Sunday.

Among the stars of that game 

was sophomore left-hander Brett 
Adcock, who struck out seven in 
three shutout innings. Guiding 
the Wolverines in their last game 

against the Hoosiers (12-10, 32-20) 
— a 4-3 win in Bloomington April 5 
— Adcock gets the nod for Wednes-
day and will lead the pitching staff 
into battle.

The sophomore is 6-1 with a 2.00 

earned-run average in his last seven 
starts. But should he run into trouble, 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich isn’t afraid 
to tap into his resources to get outs.

“One positive about our staff — 

whether it’s our starters or relievers 
— is that everybody is battle-tested,” 
Bakich said. “Everyone’s been in 
some type of a nail-biter, some type 
of a close game, some type of a big 
situations where they had to make 
big pitches.

“That’s only going to help us.”
What also helps is that the Wol-

verines can usually count on their 
offense to provide some breathing 
room. Leading the conference in hits, 

on-base percentage, 
and a bevy of other 
statistics, Michigan 
has no shortage of 
production 
at 
the 

plate.

Sure, 
there 
are 

four 
Wolverines 

ranked inside the 
conference’s top 11 
in batting average, 
but the bottom of the 
order — which went 

8-for-18 in Sunday’s win over the 
Cowboys — makes Michigan a legiti-
mate threat against any team.

“One-through-nine, 
anybody 

can step up at anytime,” said senior 
catcher Kendall Patrick. “(Opposing) 
pitching coaches know that, and it 
makes them pitch everybody straight-
up because they know there’s a dan-
gerous guy behind them.”

Ranking last in RPI, Michigan will 

need to win the whole tournament 
to earn its first postseason berth 
since 2008. But with its best team 
in Bakich’s tenure, the excitement 
around the team is equally high.

“We’ve got to grind, and we know 

that,” Bakich said. “We know that the 
end of the year is always going to be a 
grind, always going to be a battle, so 
we’ve got to play pitch-to-pitch.

“We know we’re going to take 

some blows, we know we’re going 
to trade punches, and we look for-
ward to that challenge.”

Seniors end on high note, 
beat No. 13 Oklahoma State

If there’s one way to win a 

baseball game, it’s through dom-
inant pitching.

The Michigan baseball team 

(14-10 Big Ten, 33-23 overall) con-
trolled its 
regular-
season 
finale 
with pitching, en route to its 6-2 
win against No. 13 Oklahoma 
State on Saturday.

Whether it was sophomore left-

hander Brett Adcock’s dominance 
— Adcock pitched 3.0 innings, 
recording seven strikeouts and 
one hit — or the relievers strong 
showing, giving up just two earned 
runs, the Wolverines’ pitching 
fired on all cylinders to the tune 
of 15 total strikeouts and just four 
hits allowed on the afternoon.

“Adcock did a great job of set-

ting the tone,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “He attacked 
the zone and mixed up all of his 
pitches. I thought he did a terrific 
job. … He was able to keep them 
off-balance.

“I thought (senior right-hand-

ed pitcher) Donnie Eaton was 
very good in his inning, striking 
out the side. … Our guys weren’t 
going to be denied today.”

Conversely, Oklahoma State 

(34-17) faced trouble against 

Michigan’s 
offensive 
lineup. 

With a 0.89 earned-run aver-
age coming into his start, right-
hander Remey Reed seemed like 
a tough matchup for any offense 
to go up against.

But the Wolverines didn’t let 

up, highlighted by senior out-
fielder Jackson Gline’s two-run 
blast in the third — his second 
home run in the series. Reed was 
pulled after 3.1 innings, giving 
up seven hits, three runs and 
striking out zero.

The 
Cowboys’ 
offense 

attempted several comebacks, 
with the most notable being a 
three on, two out situation faced 
by freshman left-hander Michael 
Hendrickson in the fifth. Okla-
homa State’s shortstop Donnie 
Walton came 
through with 
a 
two-RBI 

single, 
but 

further dam-
age was pre-
vented 
after 

senior 
right 

fielder Kevin 
White nabbed 
catcher Gage 
Green on a throw to freshman 
third baseman Jake Bivens, who 
promptly tagged Green out.

Though the pitching didn’t 

come without its share of stress-
ful innings, the defense record-
ed outs when balls went in play. 

With a runner on, infielder 
David Petrino hit a deep fly ball 
to left field off of sophomore 
left-hander Keith Lehmann. But 
junior left fielder Cody Bruder 
made the catch and saved what 
would’ve been extra bases and 
resulted in a tie game.

After the possible comeback 

opportunities, Oklahoma State 
fell apart in the bottom half 
of the eighth, when Michigan 
tacked on three insurance runs, 
attributed in part by fifth-year 
senior catcher Kendall Patrick’s 
two-RBI double against right-
hander Carson LaRue.

For Michigan, it ends its regu-

lar season with its most wins 
since 2010, and is hungry for suc-
cess in the Big Ten Tournament.

“A win like 

this … brings 
momentum,” 
said 
Bakich. 

“It’s 
a 
good 

feeling to have. 
These 
guys 

work extreme-
ly 
hard 
and 

deserve 
suc-

cess. The way 

we played today with the execu-
tion, the effort and the mentality. 
The total feeling today of (us) not 
going to be denied.

“If we bottle this up and keep 

this going, we’re going to be a 
tough team to beat.”

Before the first pitch was 

delivered, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins 
gave 
junior 

centerfielder 
Sierra Law-
rence a fist 
bump as she 
stepped 
up 

to the plate. 
The 
gentle 

punch was followed by a strong, 
metaphoric one as the Wolverines 
came out swinging from the start. 
They didn’t wait around, sizing 
up their opponent. The jabs came 
quick and early.

On the third pitch of the ball 

game, Lawrence lined the ball 
just inside the right-field foul line 
for a double. She came around to 
score after two illegal pitches by 
Pittsburgh right-hander Savan-
nah King. Junior second baseman 
Sierra Romero and sophomore left 
fielder Kelly Christner reached on a 
hit-by-pitch and walk, respectively, 
putting King’s start in jeopardy 
already.

No. 3 Michigan (54-6 overall) 

wouldn’t stop throwing the Pan-
thers (37-22) haymakers from 
there, winning, 10-3.

Junior right fielder Kelsey Sus-

alla delivered the early knockout 
punch with a three-run homer for 
an early 4-0 lead. The uppercut 

knocked King out of the circle, 
ending her day without recording 
an out.

“I don’t want to give away at-

bats,” Hutchins said. “I want them 
to play hard every pitch.”

Three batters later, freshman 

designated player Aidan Falk con-
tinued her hot streak, smacking a 
double down the right-field foul 
line to score senior catcher Lauren 
Sweet to push the lead to five.

Sophomore 
shortstop 
Abby 

Ramirez struck out to end the 
inning. Nonetheless, the Wolver-
ines batted around the lineup in 
the first frame, leading to a stand-
ing ovation from the crowd as they 
headed back to the dugout.

Pittsburgh tried to counter with 

two runners in scoring position in 
the bottom of the first, but failed to 
score after senior left-hander Hay-
lie Wagner earned a groundout to 
get out of the 
jam.

Michigan 

also hurt the 
Panthers 
on 

the defensive 
side. 
With 

zero 
down 

and one on 
first base in 
the second inning, Wagner earned 
a strikeout. Showing no hesitation 
behind the plate, Sweet rifled the 
ball to catch the Pittsburgh base 
runner stealing.

With the bases loaded in the 

third inning, Lawrence came up to 
bat. And again, she delivered — this 
time with a bases-clearing double, 
hitting the top of the right-center-
field wall. Lawrence advanced to 
third on an errant 
throw 
home, 

as the last run 
across the plate 
put the game into 
run-rule 
terri-

tory, 8-0.

“I don’t think 

I ever even real-
ized that I had 
two 
strikes,” 

Lawrence 
said. 

“I’m just going up there to get a 
hit.”

The Panthers’ offense came to 

life in its half of the third inning. 
Up to the plate with runners on 
second and third, designated 
player Jenna Modic hit a rocket 

up the middle for 
a two-RBI dou-
ble, 
putting 
the 

score at 8-2. The 
double would lead 
to Wagner’s exit 
from the game, as 
sophomore right-
hander 
Megan 

Betsa took over in 

the circle. 

After earning a groundout, 

Betsa would surrender another 
run by way of an RBI single, cut-
ting the Pittsburgh deficit back to 
five. The damage ended there, as 

Betsa got the hitter to fly out to 
centerfield to end the inning.

“(At that point) I thought we 

were a little tentative,” Hutchins 
said. “I just felt we were start-

ing to hold our 
breath a little 
bit to get to the 
outcome.”

With a run-

ner 
on 
third 

base 
in 
the 

top of the fifth 
inning, Romero 
stepped up to 
the plate. What 
she 
did 
next 

was inches away from another 
statistic to add her name to in 
the Wolverines’ record book. 
She blasted a ball toward the 
right-field wall. It was inches 
away from a home run to give her 
the Michigan individual career 
record, falling just short, hitting 
the top of the wall, allowing her 
to leg out a RBI triple. Christner 
followed with an RBI of her own, 
giving the Wolverines a 10-3 lead.

Christner’s RBI was the last 

run Michigan would score, as it 
couldn’t muster another blow to 
push the game into a run-rule 
win.

Betsa delivered the final hook 

by earning a strikeout to end the 
game.

Sunday’s Regional Final game 

was the last punch Michigan 
had to throw in the first round. 

There’s one more round, one 
weekend, between the Wolver-
ines and a trip to the Women’s 
College World Series. The road 
will only get tougher from here 
on out. But if Michigan continues 
to hit teams hard, there’s no rea-
son that its last fight won’t be in 
Oklahoma City.

“I told our kids, ‘Congratula-

tions, you’re one of 16 teams in the 
country that gets to have practice 
Tuesday,’ ” Hutchins said. “It’s a 
great accomplishment and we’re 
very excited about it. It’s one of 
our goals.”
