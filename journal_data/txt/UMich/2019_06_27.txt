Community 
shows support for 
Sudanese people 
Sunday afternoon

In the wake of a violent 
attack in Sudan leading to at 
least 30 deaths, students and 
activists packed the Diag on 
Sunday to demand action and to 
show support for the Sudanese 
people. The rally consisted of a 
recapitulation of the events, a 
prayer and an open discussion 
which followed shortly after in 
North Quad Residence Hall.
The 
humanitarian 
crisis 
in 
Sudan 
first 
began 
when 
protesters 
demanded 
long-
time president of Sudan, Omar 
al-Bashir, be removed from office 
after remaining in power for 
more than 30 years. Protests were 
first provoked when President 
Bashir’s 
government 
imposed 
emergency austerity measures in 
an attempt to save the Country’s 
failing economy in December 
2018. Protesters succeeded in 
forcing Bashir out of the office, 
and a seven-member Transitional 
Military Council replaced him. 

Despite the removal of the 
president, the TMC struggled 
to appease the tension in Sudan. 
Protesters continued to demand 
a civilian-led government, in 
response, the TMC launched a 
violent attack on protesters on 
June 3, resulting in at least 30 
deaths. 
Khadega Mohammed, Wayne 
State University junior and one of 
the organizers of the event, said 
her goal is to help the community 
become aware of the current 
situation in the country and the 
severity of the crisis.
“I 
think 
it 
is 
especially 
important 
that 
we 
organize 
something 
like 
this 
because 
what is happening in Sudan 
is not just a Sudanese cause, 
it is a humanitarian cause,” 
Mohammed said. “I’ve noticed 
that a lot of people are silent 
about this, there is nothing 
happening in Michigan, there is 
no awareness event for it.”
Because 
of 
her 
Sudanese 
heritage, 
the 
situation 
was 
personal for Mohammed. With 
this connection, she felt the 
obligation to spread awareness. 
“If nobody is going to do it, 
then I’m going to have to do it,” 
Mohammed said. “This is my 
people, this is my country that 
I care about. So I’m going to do 
an event to raise awareness and 
to echo the scream of Sudanese 

people.” 
During the rally, Mohammed 
led the chanting of phrases such 
as “Who are we? Sudanese. What 
do we want? Justice. When do 
we want it? Right now” and “No 
justice, no peace” to voice the 
struggle for justice in Sudan.
Zaynab Elkolaly, an incoming 
freshman to the University, said 
she believes regardless of race 
and ethnicity, everyone should 
feel obligated to show their 
support for those affected. 
“You don’t have to be Sudanese 
to care about a humanitarian 
crisis,” Elkolaly said. “People are 
too motivated by the fact that it 
would be their family or someone 
they care personally involved, 
but I don’t think that should be 
a factor, it should be the people 
who need help, and we need to 
respond to that.”
Elkolaly also criticized what 
she believes to be the ignorance 
and stereotypical assumptions 
Americans tend to have when it 
comes to crisis in underdeveloped 
nations. 
“In this region of the world, 
Middle East and Africa, there 
is this tendency for people to 
believe that, ‘Oh, it’s a third world 
developing country, there is going 
to be violence,’” Elkolaly said. 

Faculty assist 
in victorious 
project design

Three professors, ‘U’ 
alum win competiton 
with proposal 
‘Detroit Square’

Over the past two years, the DIA 
Plaza/Midtown Cultural Connections 
international 
design 
competition 
accepted project proposals that could 
transform the Midtown district of 
Detroit. The goal of the competition 
is to unite 12 cultural institutions, 
including the Charles H. Wright 
Museum of African American History, 
Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit Public 
Library and University of Michigan. 
More than forty project submissions 
were narrowed down to three finalists 
and a winner titled “Detroit Square.” 
The project has a core team of Olivier 
Phillippe from Agence Ter (based in 
Paris, France); Anya Sirota and Jean 
Louis Farges from Akoaki (Detroit); 
Cezanne Charles and John Marshall 
from rootoftwo (Detroit); and Harley 
Etienne, an assistant professor of 
urban and regional planning at the 
University 
Taubman 
College 
of 
Architecture and Urban Planning. 
In addition to Etienne, three other 
of these team members have ties to 
the University. Sirota is an associate 
professor 
of 
architecture 
at 
the 
Taubman College, Marshall is an 
associate professor at the School of 
Art & Design and Taubman College 
and Charles is an alum of the School of 
Public Policy. 
Sirota said she believes her team’s 
key to success was their plan being 
more fluid and adaptable instead of 
concrete and decisive. 
“It is not a finished plan; it is not 
a masterplan in and of itself,” Sirota 
said. “It is a framework to engage the 
12 institutions. It proceeds with a very 
clear, strong diagram of its shared 
parts, but then assumes they will 
need to be adjusted to conform to the 
material reality of the institutions’ 
needs.”

Company opens 
A2 research space 

‘Keep Moving 
Forward’ looks for 
engineering talent 
from ‘U’ students

On June 11, Silicon Valley-
based company Keep Looking 
Ahead 
opened 
a 
temporary 
Research and Development site 
in Ann Arbor. The global capital 
equipment company specializes 
in artificial intelligence, sensor 
technology and protons and 
electrons, and hopes to take 
advantage of the engineering 
talent the University of Michigan 
provides, according to Click on 
Detroit.com.
KLA started in 1976 when the 
company had a breakthrough 
with a mask inspection tool. 
They currently partner with 
customers around the world to 
develop state of the art inspection 
and metrology technology. 

With more than 10,000 global 
employees, 
KLA 
announced 
their plans for opening an Ann 
Arbor location Oct. 24, 2018. 
In a news release on their 
website, CEO Rick Wallace, a 
graduate of the University with a 
bachelor’s degree in engineering, 
said he hopes to strengthen ties 
with the University.
John McLaughlin, Ann Arbor 
site leader for KLA and 2005 
University graduate, said the 
company purposely picked the 
location in Ann Arbor near North 
Campus after considering more 
than 350 possible sites because of 
its high quality-of-life, low cost-
of-living compared to the Bay 
Area and its engineering talent. 
“Big 
picture: 
we 
are 
creating 
600 
jobs 
in 
Ann 
Arbor,” 
McLaughlin 
said. 
“We are establishing a second 
headquarters and a major R&D 
facility here. 

Ann Arbor 
residents celebrate 
begininngs of 
outdoor sale

This summer, the Ann Arbor 
Farmers Market is celebrating 
its 100th birthday. Over the past 
century, the farmers market has 
become an Ann Arbor staple with 
142 stalls open on Wednesdays 
and Saturdays throughout the 
summer. The outdoor shop also 
includes Kindlefest, a holiday 
market open only in December. 
The Farmers Market is an 
outdoor shopping center across 
the street from Zingerman’s 
Delicatessen full of fresh, brightly 
colored flowers that sit alongside 
bundles of produce. Vendors 
sell merchandise ranging from 
jewelry, breads and jams, to local 
coffee beans and even snow cones 
as the summer months begin to 
heat up. 
The Kerrytown market has 
been serving the community 
fresh produce and locally-made 
food since its 1919. As noted in 
an Ann Arbor Observer article in 
1978, the history of the Farmer’s 
Market included three big moves. 
Initially, 
the 
shops 
were 
located on Main Street but were 
then quickly moved near the 
courthouse on Fourth Avenue 
after residents complained Main 
was becoming too clogged up 

with vendors and patrons. The 
market continued to grow, and 
so did the need to expand. In 
1931, the local market moved to 
its current location with over 
124 stalls surrounding a paved 
walkway, which was built as a 
Great Depression Era Works 
Progress Administration project. 
The celebration of the farmers 
market’s 100th birthday began in 
the beginning of May with posts 
on the market’s Facebook page in 
tandem with an exhibit opening 
at the Ann Arbor District Library 
in July. 
Stephanie Willet, Ann Arbor 
Farmers 
Market 
manager, 
said she has been planning 
events throughout the summer, 
including a food truck rally and 
outdoor movie screening in July. 
“We are going to be trying to 
highlight our history as well,” 
Willet said. “We’ll have a bunch 
of old photos, we’ll be printing 
those on banners and hanging 
them up around the market.”
The 
farmer’s 
market 
will 
officially 
commemorate 
their 
100th year anniversary with 
a “birthday party” on Aug. 17. 
The party will feature the Ann 
Arbor 
Symphony 
Orchestra, 
along with an array of children’s 
events, such as an “instrument 
petting zoo” where children are 
able to play with the symphony’s 
instruments. There will also be 
a magician and free ice cream 
to commemorate the expansive 
history of the farmers market.

For 
the 
past 
three 
weeks, Ann Arbor has 
been 
using 
a 
more 
unorthodox 
landscap-
ing method: goatscaping. 
Ten goats placed on two 
of Gallup Park’s islands 
have 
been 
conducting 
brush 
management 
to 
prevent invasive species 
from entering the area. 
According to a press 
release from the city of 
Ann Arbor, using goats 
for brush management is 
an alternative to typical 
invasive species manage-
ment, as the city man-
ages these areas by hand. 
According to Erika Pratt, 
Parks 
and 
Recreation 
GIVE 365 volunteer and 
outreach coordinator, the 
goatscaping project is a 
pilot program with hopes 
to expand. 
“I know there’s a lot 
of interest within differ-
ent parks, different folks 
that have different areas 

in mind for future goat-
scaping, so I’m hopeful 
that we’ll continue this 
practice,” 
Pratt 
said. 
“It’s really affordable … 
By and large people have 
really loved it. We live 
in a community where 
people really care about 
whether or not we’re 
putting chemicals on our 
spaces.”
On 
June 
24, 
more 
than 100 people showed 
up to Gallup Park for a 
“Goats at Gallup” Talk 
and Walk for a tour with 
Mike Mourer from Twin 
Willow Ranch. Mourer 
and his family breed and 
raise the goats on their 
farm in Milan, Michigan 
and is home to more than 
70 goats. 
The tour groups had 
the opportunity to pet 
and interact with the 
goats as they were eating 
leaves off a fallen tree. 
LSA sophomore Emma 
Hammond 
visited 
the 
goats with her mother 
after hearing a lot about 
the project. 

“I 
think 
it’s 
really 
cool to see up close what 
they’re 
doing,” 
Ham-
mond said. “We’ve been 
on the island before the 
goats and it was so over-
grown, so it’s cool to 
actually see how much 
they eat.”
The goats have cleared 
away much of the brush 
on the islands. All 10 
goats have been living 
on the islands full time 
for the past three weeks. 
They eat invasive spe-
cies like honeysuckle and 
buckthorn, as well as poi-
son ivy, which is harm-
less to the goats.
“They’ve got it made 
here, they get to eat and 
take it easy,” Mourer 
said. “They are good for 
the environment because 
as they eat the seeds and 
everything else it grinds 
it up so small because 
they have four stomachs 
… so by the time it comes 
out its not viable as a seed 
anymore, so that’s part of 
breaking the cycle of the 
invasives.”

On Thursday afternoon, 
the University of Michigan 
Board of Regents gathered 
at the Richard L. Postma 
Family Clubhouse for the 
annual meeting to approve 
budget proposals for the 
University’s three campuses, 
athletic department and the 
University Health System. 
The board also appointed a 
new U-M Flint chancellor 
and a new LSA dean.
University President Mark 
Schlissel began the meet-
ing by holding a moment of 
silence for the passing of 
Douglass Diggs, husband of 
Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs 
(D).
“(Douglass 
Diggs) 
was 
passionate about creating 
opportunities for talented, 
but underrepresented stu-
dents,” Schlissel said. “He 
was active in the U of M 
community, and the Michi-
gan family will miss him 
deeply.”
Schlissel then announced 
the winner of the Russell 

Lectureship, the University’s 
highest honor for senior fac-
ulty, as Engineering profes-
sor Steven Forrest. 
He also recognized Carrie 
Ferrario, assistant professor 
of pharmacology, Xianzhe 
Jia, associate professor of 
climate and space sciences 
and engineering, Corinna 
Schindler, associate profes-
sor of chemistry and Megan 
Tompkins-Stange, assistant 
professor of public policy, as 
recipients of the Henry Rus-
sell Award, the University’s 
highest honor for faculty in 
the early to middle stages of 
their career.
To replace current U-M 
Flint 
chancellor 
Susan 
Borrego, Schlissel recom-
mended chancellor Debasish 
Dutta, the former chancellor 
of Rutgers University. The 
board unanimously appoint-
ed Dutta, whose five-year 
term begins on Aug. 1.
Later in the meeting, Pro-
vost Martin Philbert rec-
ommended Anne Curzan, 
professor of English lan-
guage and literature, as the 
new LSA dean. Appointed by 
an unanimous vote, her term 

will begin Sep. 1.
“As a faculty member, she 
exemplifies the University’s 
commitment to research, 
teaching 
and 
service 
to 
higher education and to the 
broader 
public,” 
Philbert 
said.
Much of the meeting 
centered around approving 
budget proposals — all of 
which were approved — for 
the 2020 fiscal year, which 
begins July 1.
Schlissel began the budget 
presentation by emphasizing 
an additional $23 million 
in funding for need-based 
financial aid, which Schlis-
sel said will “offset” a 1.9 
percent increase for in-state 
undergraduate tuition. He 
noted this in-state tuition 
increase is the smallest in six 
years.
With the 11.2 percent 
increase in financial aid 
funding, 
Schlissel 
said 
tuition rates this next year 
will not increase for most in-
state undergraduates with 
need-based aid packages.

The 
lack 
of 
adequate 
reasoning 
for 
Schlissel’s 
abstention 
from 
testifying, 
especially in a situation where 
he is not intended to be cross-
examined, is concerning. It is 
clear that President Schlissel’s 
position grants him oversight 
over the University as a whole, 
but 
it 
remains 
worrisome 
that 
he 
is 
uncomfortable 
or 
incapable 
of 
publicly 
explaining the intricacies of the 
University’s sexual misconduct 
policy; a policy that is integral 
to student safety and rights. 
These sentiments were publicly 
supported by Judge Arthur 
Tarnow, who criticized Schlissel 
for his and the University’s 
unwillingness 
to 
streamline 
the case proceedings, writing, 
“The 
University’s 
attorneys 
appear to be more concerned 
with 
keeping 
the 
President 
out of the public eye than with 
prompt resolution of this case 

and providing a fair process for 
adjudicating sexual misconduct 
claims.” 
The lack of definitive public 
figures 
surrounding 
the 
University’s sexual misconduct 
policy 
points 
to 
broader 
confusion 
surrounding 
the 
foundation of the policy itself. 
When legal representatives for 
the University offered to bring 
in a different spokesperson to 
testify about the sexual assault 
policy, they were unable to 
identify who that would be 
when prompted by the judge. 
This begs the question: Who 
is the authority who can be 
held accountable for the policy 
and 
its 
implementations, 
if 
not President Schlissel? It is 
evident that the University 
does not have a clear person in 
charge and is hoping to merely 
avoid 
confrontation 
about 
this lack of leadership. This is 
unacceptable, and we implore 

the University to point to a 
clear and reliable source on the 
matter.
Considering 
the 
current 
social 
climate 
regarding 
sexual misconduct, especially 
within institutions of higher 
education across the country, 
we feel that President Schlissel 
and 
the 
University 
should 
be considering a settlement 
meeting 
regarding 
these 
University policies to be a top 
priority. Delaying the process 
more will ultimately only serve 
to undermine the University’s 
authority on the subject going 
forward. 
The 
University’s 
President should have a clear 
idea 
of 
the 
direction 
we 
are moving in terms of our 
treatment of accusations and 
cases of sexual misconduct, and 
avoiding policy discussions like 
this is only counter-productive 
to the creation of a fair and safe 
school environment.

D

ioxane, a potentially carcino-
genic chemical that has 
leaked into Ann Arbor’s 
aquifer slowly over two decades 
from Gelman Sciences, Inc., was 
found in our drinking water on 
two separate occasions in the 
Huron River and Barton Pond. 
The plume, discovered in well 
water in 1985, has migrated in the 
groundwater over the last three 
decades and now encompasses a 
much larger area. While the fed-
eral, state and local governments 
have been entrenched in legal 
battles over this environmental 
issue, the threat to public health 
has steadily increased.
As a Masters of Social Work 
student at the University of Mich-
igan, and as someone who cares 
not only about the environment 
but also the health and well-being 
of students and community mem-
bers who drink this water, it is 
alarming that this issue has gone 
unresolved for decades. Across 
the state and country, similar 
issues have taken several years 
and an abundance of resources 
to resolve (Flint, Baltimore and 
several others). As a result of 
agonizingly slow and expensive 
undertakings, residents are left 
endangered, confused and often 
defeated, lacking a real solution. 
The longer we wait for the gov-
ernment to devise a plan, the lon-
ger Ann Arbor residents have to 
worry about their ability to feel 
safe and healthy while enjoying 
the natural resources around 
them.
While some feel powerless to 
address issues like the dioxane 
plume, I am not alone in feel-
ing the University of Michigan 
should look locally for solutions 
and start doing the necessary 
research regarding this poten-
tial health hazard. Perhaps the 
University lacks a sense of urgen-
cy — even government officials 
litigating the issue seemingly 
lack this resolve. Or maybe the 
donation made by the family of 
the founder of Gelman Sciences, 
Inc. to U -M’s Risk Science Cen-
ter creates a conflict of inter-
est and gives pause to action. 
Regardless of the root cause, the 
wealth of knowledge and poten-
tial resources from a university 
should not be held back when jus-
tice and the safety of the commu-
nity is at stake.
In social work, our mission 
is to promote social justice and 
the dignity and worth of all indi-

viduals regardless of race, socio-
economic status and background. 
This includes advocating for our 
community and its members, 
ensuring they have access to the 
resources needed to live healthy 
and fulfilling lives. Issues like 
the dioxane plume dispropor-
tionately 
affect 
communities 
of color and vulnerable people. 
Given this marked disparity, it 
is everyone’s responsibility to 
raise awareness and promote 
action around issues in order to 
serve these marginalized com-
munities that may not have the 
resources to adequately advocate 
for themselves. This call applies 
not only to social workers, but to 
all schools within the University 
of Michigan that seek to produce 
leaders within their field of study 
and continue to build the prestige 
of the University.
At the University of Michi-
gan, we claim to be “the Lead-
ers and Best.” But, is that motto 
fulfilled in our relationship with 
nearby 
communities? 
When 
we, as a University community, 
choose to bypass opportunities 
to perform research and develop 
high-impact projects that cre-
ate positive change in our own 
neighborhoods, we fail to uphold 
that 
standard. 
By 
investing 
research capabilities and skills in 
environmental safety and public 
health projects, we could utilize 
the privilege afforded to the Uni-
versity of Michigan and play an 
active leadership role in the com-
munity, laying the groundwork 
for positive community interac-
tion. Reassuringly, several stu-
dents have already taken up this 
call and have begun to pioneer 
their own initiatives to support 
their community.
The environmental and health 
impacts for the greater Ann 
Arbor area due to the dioxane 
plume worsen as time passes, 
and there is still no solution in 
sight. The University of Michigan 
should leverage its resources and 
the skills of students and faculty 
to develop innovative solutions to 
this decades-long problem and, in 
doing so, renew its dedication to 
serving its neighbors. Neglect-
ing to do so will result in further 
contamination 
and 
ill-placed 
reliance on time-consuming legal 
action.

Is the University responsible for local issues?

was due in U.S. District Court in Detroit to explain the University’s 
sexual misconduct policy in a settlement conference for the ongoing 
Doe v. University of Michigan lawsuit. On June 12, this hearing was delayed 
until further notice. The stay, prompted by an emergency petition sent by 
University lawyers, was the latest in a set of actions by the University to 
keep Schlissel from testifying publicly on the matter. We as an Editorial 
Board feel that the University should stop delaying the case and encourage 
President Schlissel to appear before the court; furthermore, we find the 
University’s lack of clarity surrounding the policy in question to be extremely 
disconcerting, and it should be actively working to remedy this issue.

M

edia has the power to teach. 
Sometimes what it teaches 
us is dangerous — our bod-
ies are disgusting, our love is invalid 
— but sometimes what we learn from 
media has a positive impact. I wrote 
about this power in my last column, and 
the sentiment rings true in today’s piece. 
Today, media is teaching us to stop for-
getting history, and instead allowing it 
to guide our future decisions.
The story of the Central Park Five 
reached infamy far before my gen-
eration existed. I personally only knew 
small details about the case, and had 
only been exposed to it because of 
Donald Trump’s involvement and its 
discussion during his 2016 presidential 
candidacy. For those alive in the year 
1989, the case of the Central Park Five 
is comparable to OJ Simpson: You don’t 
forget where you were when you heard 
it. 
Now, the Netflix mini-series “When 
They See Us” has catapulted the story 
of the Central Park Five back into the 
public eye. For those who haven’t 
watched the series or are unfamiliar 
with the story: After a night of crime 
and violence in Central Park, a female 
jogger is found brutally raped and 
assaulted the next morning. Five young 
men of color — four Black and one Lati-
no — are arrested. All of the boys are 
under the age of 16, and they only con-
fess to the crime after hours of abusive 
interrogation. Some went over a day 
without proper sleep or food, and none 
had a parent or counsel present. The 
boys were all convicted, and spend a 
range of five to 12 years behind bars for a 
crime that DNA eventually proved they 
did not commit.
“When They See Us” is a heartbreak-
ing journey through the trials and 
convictions, demonstrating how hor-
rifically these men were treated. Near 
the time of the trial, President Donald 
Trump spent $85,000 on a full-page 
ad in four newspapers calling for the 
return of the death penalty just to exe-
cute the teenage boys, an act for which 
he refuses to apologize. As five men of 
color accused of raping and beating a 
white woman, these five boys were vili-
fied and presumed guilty by the media, 
a prejudice that hung a dark cloud over 
the court and led to the harmful, unfair 
result of their trials.
The mini-series has reignited the 
rightful outrage against people on the 
wrong side of justice. The lead prosecu-
tor, Elizabeth Lederer, resigned from 
her position at Columbia Law follow-
ing backlash sparked by the mini-series. 
The head of the sex crimes division of the 
NYPD, Linda Fairstein, also resigned 
from several boards thanks to criticism 
associated with “When They See Us.” 

The backlash mirrors what followed 
2015’s “Making a Murderer,” which 
profiled yet another wrongful convic-
tion. Again, the prosecutor in this case 
received widespread disapproval — 
people just couldn’t grasp how this man 
could be put away for something he 
didn’t do.
The problem is, this happens every 
single day. Wrongful convictions like 
the Central Park Five happen all the 
time — which is far too often to make a 
Netflix series for each. The roar of out-
rage when these shows premiere is jus-
tified — the American criminal justice 
system is significantly broken. But even-
tually, the next hot thing comes along, 
the outrage dies down, and thousands 
of disadvantaged people are left to deal 
with trials built to lock them away. 
A great pairing to “When They See 
Us” would be “13th,” a documentary 
on the epidemic of mass incarceration 
that plagues this country. If you are left 
heartbroken and angry from the story 
of the Central Park Five, “13th” will piss 
you off even more. But at the very least, 
you’ll recognize the institutional racism 
and classism that landed five young boys 
of color in prison 30 years ago. The Unit-
ed States is the world leader in incar-
ceration, with over 2.2 million people in 
jails and prisons, a 500 percent increase 
in the past 40 years. Out of those 2.2 mil-
lion people, 67 percent are Black, despite 
Black people only making up 37 percent 
of the American population. A Black 
man has a 1 in 3 chance of being incar-
cerated, a Latino man 1 in 6, compared 
to the 1 in 17 probability among white 
men. These are the basic statistics of 
the disparities in the criminal justice 
system, and they only get more dis-
gusting as you go deeper. Private pris-
ons, drug laws, bail money, felon voting 
laws — all of these and more benefit 
from keeping poor people and people 
of color on a one way road to prison.
So what are we going to do? Are 
we going to forget this outrage until 
Netflix formulates another true crime 
drama to rake in subscribers? Don’t let 
this outrage go away, because the real-
ity of the Central Park Five sure won’t. 
There are still young men of color 
being wrongfully imprisoned, and 
sticking them in a harmful cycle soci-
ety has made nearly impossible to end. 
There are young children being tried 
as adults because they were not given 
the resources or treatment necessary to 
prevent this. Public outrage is good, but 
there is always more.

A 

pop-up in my Facebook 
browser 
prompted 
me 
“How 
much 
do 
you 
think Facebook cares about its 
users?” I thought about it for a bit, 
and decided that “neither agree 
nor disagree” most adequately 
summarized my feelings. 
So when Facebook thanked 
me for my feedback, promising to 
“use it to improve Facebook,” and 
asking me to share any additional 
thoughts, I decided to do my civic 
duty and participate in the demo-
cratic process.
I said: I think Facebook is 
becoming a monopoly and needs 
to be broken up. It’s been done in 
the past with every generation’s 
new monopoly: Ours is just online 
giants like Facebook and Ama-
zon. Don’t take it personally, Mark 
Zuckerberg, you just own way too 
much of our information for any 
one person to have.
We’ve been hearing about Face-
book consistently in the news since 
its inception, but increasingly so 
since January 2018, when the news 
of the Cambridge Analytica scan-
dal broke. This raised red flags 
about how much of our informa-
tion Facebook really has, how that 
information was misappropriated 
and the influence platforms like 
Facebook could have had on the 
2016 election. This incident was 
followed by Mark Zuckerberg’s 
two appearances on Capitol Hill 
last April when he testified in front 
of Senate and House committees 
on Facebook’s business practices, 
ethics and protection of user data. 
More Facebook scandals have 
continued to appear in the news, 
remaining at the forefront of the 
emerging dialogue on the influence 
and power of Facebook and other 
companies like it.
This is all part of a bigger pic-
ture, beyond just Facebook and 
the scandals that characterized 
2018. Since the turn of the twenty-
first century, media and technol-
ogy giants have continued to grow 
with almost unchecked power. At 
2018’s World Economic Forum in 
Davos, Switzerland, George Soros 
described Facebook and Google as 
a “menace” to society, intentionally 
engineering their services to be 
addictive.
“They claim they are merely 
distributing information. But the 
fact that they are near-monopoly 
distributors makes them public 
utilities and should subject them to 
more stringent regulations, aimed 
at preserving competition, innova-

tion, and fair and open universal 
access,” Soros said.
In May 2019, we heard from 
Chris Hughes, co-founder of Face-
book, in a New York Times op-ed. 
Hughes described the extent of 
Mark Zuckerberg’s power and 
control over Facebook, Whatsapp 
and Instagram. Zuckerberg has 
an astounding 60 percent of Face-
book’s voting shares. He doesn’t 
just run Facebook — he completely 
controls it. 
Facebook is worth half a trillion 
dollars and by Hughes’s estimate, 
over 80 percent of the world’s social 
networking revenue. He argued 
that Facebook has reached monop-
oly status, “eclipsing all of its rivals 
and erasing competition from the 
social networking category” and 
has called for the company’s lead-
ership to be broken up.
Despite Facebook’s scandals, 
it continues to thrive. “Even dur-
ing the annus horribilis of 2018,” 
Hughes wrote, “Facebook’s earn-
ings per share increased by an 
astounding 40 percent compared 
with the year before.” Hughes 
offered two explanations for Face-
book’s continued prosperity; first, 
less people are going off Facebook 
than we think, with most deletions 
being temporary due to the lack 
of a compelling alternative; sec-
ond, those who do choose to leave 
Facebook often turn to Instagram, 
which is owned by Facebook. 
Sleeker and simpler, Instagram 
has somehow managed to remain 
separate from Facebook’s scandals.
I was surprised to learn that 
Facebook 
is 
still 
prospering. 
Among college students, on the 
precarious edge of millennial and 
Generation Z, it feels like Facebook 
use is dwindling. Only four years 
ago, Facebook was integral to the 
high school social scene and cul-
ture. For over a decade, people have 
used Facebook to unite over shared 
experiences online. Today, I notice 
my friends posting on Facebook far 
less, and many high schoolers don’t 
have Facebook accounts. 
I don’t think our constantly 
updating news feeds have gradu-
ally dwindled because of fear 
about information security, or even 
because we know that Facebook 
influenced the 2016 election. I 
think it’s because, quite simply, it’s 
going out of fashion. Facebook ren-
dered MySpace obsolete by 2010, 
and as 2020 approaches, Face-
book is being crowded out by apps 
that capture our young, impatient 
minds’ attention more. And yet, we 

are all still on Facebook. Why?
I think Facebook comes in handy 
for the small things that don’t add 
anything extremely valuable to our 
lives anymore, but make it worth 
not deactivating — it’s not much 
more than updating photo albums 
for your friends and family, sharing 
articles and providing commentary 
on current events, but we’ve been 
doing so for so long that it makes 
more sense to continue than to stop. 
But whether or not we’re actively 
using Facebook, our information 
remains in the company’s hands 
nonetheless. Even if we delete our 
Facebook accounts, we’ll still be on 
Instagram. Echoing what seems to 
be a common sentiment of many 
millennials and Gen Z-ers alike, 
Mashable published an article in 
2018 entitled, “I will delete Face-
book, but you can pry Instagram 
from my cold, dead hands.” In fact, 
I would argue many of us aren’t 
even ready to delete Facebook — 
because if we were, wouldn’t we 
have already done so? 
I’m not suggesting that we all 
will, or even should, get off social 
media. Maybe it’s our biggest 
enemy, but it’s sometimes our most 
important friend, essential to our 
social lives today. Technology is 
irreversibly ingrained in our exis-
tence now, and denouncing it alto-
gether isn’t feasible or productive. 
We could all theoretically delete 
our Facebook accounts, but that’s 
just the tip of the iceberg. Once 
we delete Facebook, what about 
Instagram? What about Google, 
Amazon and Apple? What about 
the streaming services, email lists, 
financial institutions and thou-
sands of other providers to which 
we’ve inevitably provided informa-
tion?
The turn of the twentieth cen-
tury was characterized by monop-
olies. Now almost 130 years after 
the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, 
many monopolies have been bro-
ken up, from Standard Oil in 1911 to 
AT&T in 1982. The technology that 
revolutionized the world a hundred 
years ago needed eventually to be 
regulated, controlled and divided, 
and the arguably monopolistic 
power of all tech giants deserves, at 
the very least, a thorough examina-
tion.

Childish Gambino announced in 
early 2018 that his next project would 
be his last. Not the last for the musi-
cian, but for the online, Wu-Tang 
Clan generated moniker that he had 
been producing music under for over 
a decade. I imagine then, a new, more 
mature Donald Glover will rise from 
those ashes and continue to make 
Grammy-worthy records. But until 
that day comes, we are left to wonder 
what the musician’s post-Gambino 
profile will look like.
Gambino headlined the 2019 
Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, 
playing Friday’s first nighttime show 
on the main stage, just as the sun had 
tucked itself behind the rolling hills 
of rural Tennessee. Gambino fol-
lowed on the heels of a disappointing 
Avett Brothers set, made worse by the 
fact that the anxious crowd showed 
all the excitement of sitting in a 
checkup waiting room. It was clear 
most of the patronage to the Avett 
Brothers was an attempt at scoring 
prime Gambino real estate, some of 
the audience members beginning the 
glacial push toward the front even 
before the previous performance 
finished. After a few false sightings 
(each accompanied by ecclesiastical 
screeches, then ho-hum groans), the 
singer-rapper made his entrance on 
a rising platform, unearthed from 

the center of the pit. Fog machine 
blowing and spotlight showing, we 
caught sight, for the first time, of the 
figure of this final Gambino chapter: 
long beard, partially braided hair, 
loose white drawstring sweatpants, a 
shirtless upper body. 
This is the Childish Gambino we 
first met in the viral music video for 
his single “This is America” — a gruff, 
aged reincarnation of the lanky kid 
that first broke through playing Troy 
on the NBC sit-com “Community.” 
Gambino has come a long way in that 
time, releasing three studio albums 
(Camp in 2011, Because the Internet in 
2013 and Awaken, My Love! in 2016) 
and a slew of mixtapes in the decade 
since, his musical stylings evolving 
just as much as his look. 
It was interesting to see these 
changes played out in the audi-
ence’s energy over the course of the 
show. The first half of his set came 
mostly from Awaken, before the art-
ist looped back around to finish the 
night off with his older crowd favor-
ites. There was a noticeable discon-
nect when Gambino played tracks off 
that third studio album, the crowd 
drifting off during “Zombies” and 
“Riot,” snapping back into focus as 
soon as the first chords of “Sober” 
hit, then falling asleep again when 
more Awaken was played. (Surpris-
ingly, the crowd was most recep-
tive to all of Gambino’s post-Awaken 
singles, the Summer Pack and “This 
is America,” a collection of songs I 
think was a drop-off after the inven-

tive third album.)
Awaken was a departure for Gam-
bino, leaving his trademark snarky 
bars behind for a more soulful R&B 
sound. Though it topped out at num-
ber 5 on the US charts, the high-
est mark of any of the three studio 
albums, the album’s startling change 
of pace from the expected obsceni-
ties associated with the Gambino 
brand seems to have affected Awak-
en’s staying power, raising questions 
as to how the next chapter of Donald 
Glover’s music will be received.
***
Gambino announced himself to 
the music world as, essentially, a 
quippy rapper — one armed with 
clever bars about being a nerdy black 
kid from the projects — his verses 
often laden with an undercurrent 
of dual identity. Gambino’s music 
was raunchy and obscene, but, at its 
core, playful more than anything 
else. The rapper seemed to enjoy let-
ting his wordplay flourish, even if the 
lines about girls and money were, at 
times, pretty vapid. I look at this era 
of Gambino’s music as the final evo-
lution of the types of raps two high 
school sophomores would pass back 
and forth in the back of AP Chem-
istry. Raunchy and humorous, they 
don’t seem to care what anyone else 
thinks of them. Camp-era Gambino 
leaned on his writing more than any-
thing sonic in the songs he produced, 
the beats often fairly simple, allow-
ing the focus to land on the rapper’s 
talent for lyricism.

Gambino left out of his Bonnaroo 
set the hit single from Camp, “Bon-
fire.” Quick-witted and crude, “Bon-
fire” epitomizes early Gambino, and 
had long stood as the poster child 
for what a Childish Gambino song 
looked like. Leaving it out was a curi-
ous snub, the musician even shoving 
the single’s iconic, siren-sounding 
intro in between “3005” and “Sweat-
pants” before abandoning the song, 
never returning to it before his time 
on stage was up. As he walked away, 
everyone was floored by the perfor-
mance, but disappointment from the 
lack of “Bonfire” and “Freaks and 
Geeks,” another Camp-era hit, were 
common 
grum-
blings.
Looking at the 
artist’s musical tra-
jectory, since even 
before Camp hit the 
charts, the at first 
strange 
absence 
of these two songs 
begins to make some 
sense. 
Gambino’s 
second studio album 
Because the Internet 
was a step forward 
in production value 
and size from Camp. 
It was experimental 
in its highly sequen-
tial, narrative for-
mat, and though not 
all its risks paid off, 
Because the Internet 
lives on as an interesting attempt at 
using music as a stepping stone for a 
more expansive, multimedia experi-
ence — the album was released with 
an accompanying (near-intermina-
ble) seventy-two-page screenplay as 
well as a short film.
From Because the Internet, we 
got two of Gambino’s biggest hits 
to date, “Sweatpants” and “3005.” 
Both of these Because the Internet 
singles have iconic music videos 
where the artist raps deadpan into 
the camera while absurdities abound 
around him. The two videos have a 
lot of similar qualities and reflect the 
atmosphere of adolescent character 
erosion that the project’s screenplay 
and short film also focus on creating. 
This can be seen as Gambino Mach 2, 
an ambitious artist working on ways 
to connect his two diverging careers. 
Because the Internet has some of the 
same witty qualities of Gambino’s 
earliest work, but already the artist 
was stomaching his ego to try some-
thing new. 
Jumping forward, the R&B styl-
ings of Awaken, My Love! are nearly 
unrecognizable as the future sonic 
direction for the kid behind Camp, 
but looking at his discography from 
10,000 feet up, a clear trend toward 

new directions at every major step 
starts to emerge. Awaken has none 
of the iconic witticisms that so satu-
rated the Camp-era projects. It drops 
the expansive ambition of Because 
the Internet as well, making a point 
to be as simple, and as soulful, a 
showcase of Gambino’s singing tal-
ent as it can be. Hidden beneath this 
10-year discography is an artist with 
an incredible ear and an incredible 
voice, and it seems as he continues 
to make music, these once-hidden 
talents will continue to be paid more 
notice. 
Gambino is not alone in the music 
world as an artist whose later projects 
trend away from the 
sound that originally 
made their name. 
Two 
artists 
with 
similar 
timelines 
and statures, Kid 
Cudi and Chance the 
Rapper, both rein-
vented 
themselves 
in their sophomore 
and junior projects, 
leaving fans of their 
previous work left 
feeling 
slighted. 
Which 
raises 
an 
interesting question 
on 
what 
respon-
sibility (if any) an 
artist has to con-
tinue the spirit of 
the work that made 
them famous in the 
first place. On one hand, an artist 
whose projects seem too iterative on 
past work may be viewed as lazy or 
unoriginal, so caught up in their old 
sound that they’re afraid to push at 
their boundaries.
On the other, an artist whose proj-
ects are always a leap into the avant-
garde may be viewed as too in their 
head — obsessed with the notion that 
they can do anything, that anything 
they try will be great, they consis-
tently work too far out of their ele-
ment, eventually completely losing 
track their roots. In the end, whatever 
choices a musician makes about their 
artistic trajectory will ultimately be 
settled in the court of public opinion. 
The artist shouldn’t lose sleep over 
alienating their base, though they 
should know full well that any step 
outside of their proverbial box runs 
the risk of cutting them off from the 
fans they’ve worked so hard to culti-
vate. If the new stuff is good enough, 
people will stick around. If it’s not, 
we stomach our blows, regress back 
to our path, and we return to form 
with something like Cudi’s Passion, 
Pain & Demon Slayin’.

The temperature in subur-
ban, seaside New Jersey has 
climbed to exactly rosé degrees 
Fahrenheit, which is just a few 
degrees warmer than springtime 
Chardonnay and a full 360 from 
musing autumn Cabernet. Sum-
mertime near the shore means 
one thing: Everyone is grabbing 
for a glass of that chilled, light, 
millennial pink wine and toast-
ing “cheers” as early as 11 a.m. 
on a Friday. But what is it, really, 
about the wine that’s so attrac-
tive when mid-June hits and 
you’re near the ocean? 
Not to make an assumption, 
but I’ll assume most people don’t 
really know why rosé is pink, and 
why other wines are simply red 
or white. Wine is quite the sci-
ence, and winemakers are some 
of the world’s most romantic, 
tipsy scientists in the world. I 
normally don’t take much inter-
est in chemistry, but when wine 
is our final result, I’m listening. 
For Italy’s sake, and the sake of 
celebrating wine and heritage, 
let’s call rosé by its proper name, 
“rosato.” 
When 
winemakers 
make rosato, as opposed to a red 
or white wine, they incorporate 
only some of the color from the 
grape skins — but not enough to 
qualify the beverage as red wine.
Interestingly enough, rosato 
may be the oldest form of wine 
because it is actually the most 
straightforward to make, due 
in part to the light grape skin 

contact method. When making 
rosato, the grapes are crushed, 
and their skins remain in contact 
with the juice for a very short 
period of time — normally, no 
longer than 20 hours. The skins 
are not in contact throughout 
fermentation, as they would be 
with a red wine. The longer the 
skin is in contact with the juice, 
the darker the color will be; 
therefore, making that perfect 
bottle of rosato is a bit of a slip-
pery slope. A bottle of rosato can 
come in plethora of colors: from 
nearly sheer yellow-pink, akin to 
a sweet onion skin, to a vibrant, 
near-fuschia. 
However, 
true, 
authentic rosato tends to lean to 
the lighter side, so, if you’re in a 
wine shop without a clue, reach 
for something that resembles the 
inside of a peach, not the tube of 
baby-pink lipstick. 
It’s been said that many of the 
earliest red wines were made 
similar to modern day rosatos, 
so, our counterparts in ancient 
Roma may have been celebrat-
ing summer Fridays similarly to 
how we are today. One thing they 
didn’t have back then though: the 
marketing paradise we call Insta-
gram. Today, rosato has become 
so much about the look of the 
wine and the appearance of the 
bottle, and not so much about the 
taste. These days, on your white-
painted picnic table overlooking 
the sea, even what’s in your ice 
bucket has to fit the theme, the 
color scheme and the “brand” of a 
Hampton’s summertime, no mat-
ter where you are. Wölffer Estate 
seemed to master this when they 
created Summer in a Bottle Rosé, 

otherwise known as the most 
Instagrammable bottle of rosé 
you’ve ever seen. It costs any-
where between 22 and 25 dollars 
at most liquor stores, and is deco-
rated with multicolored flowers, 
accenting its blush, sunset color. 
The winery has been around for 
about 30 years and calls Bridge-
hampton home, using their loca-
tion to their additional advantage 
in selling cases of the bright rosé 
all over the country.
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t love 
the bottle — the design is beauti-
ful and is the perfect addition 
or centerpiece to any summer 
event. But in the taste and fla-
vor department, it isn’t a winner 
for me. What Summer in a Bottle 
does, gracefully and successfully, 
is mask the relatively tough and 
uncomplex flavor of the rosé with 
an incredible marketing ploy and 
a perfect front cover when what’s 
inside the bottle simply doesn’t 
match such facial excellence.
In spite of any criticism, 
Summer in a Bottle flies off the 
shelves, even when it costs you 
over 30 dollars, which is an over-
priced bill for an almost flavor-
less bottle. The reason being it 
looks the part. We’re so geared 
toward the digital in this tech-
nological age. With all the affir-
mation we gain from Instagram 
likes, we’re willing to sacrifice 
flavor for looks almost immedi-
ately — forgetting the purpose of 
rosé in the first place. The wine, 
like so many Italian food and bev-
erage staples, is about culture.

Rosé all day this summer

Milanese iceberg, 
nearly all of which 
was somehow fea-
tured in the show. 
Neon buzzcuts and flat-ironed manes 
raced down a pink, plexiglass runway 
and around the glossy black body of 
a 1995 Corvette, swathed in a pile of 
matching roses, peonies and orchids, 
glacially spinning as a GIF would in 
the early days of the internet. 
Visual hallmarks of the 1990s 
have been present, often in the form 
of direct regurgitation, in nostalgic 
digital art as well as trends and points 
of reference in the fashion industry 
for some time now. Versace’s visual 
legacy of elevating the gaudy and gar-
ish is cemented within almost every 
creative field that comes to mind, and 
it’s clearly come time to cash in. 
Disparate elements of the Versace 
canon clash and clamor for attention 
yet manage to coincide with bal-
ance thanks to a shared design ethos 
(pure maximalism) and a masterful 
fusion of the two defining elements 
of the show. First is the overwhelm-
ing presence of Versace’s branding 
in all forms of art that fall under the 

umbrella of “Tumblr.” The most fit-
ting example of the vague, amalgam-
ated genre is Vaporwave, the Petra 
Cortright and early-aughts gamer-
inspired atmosphere that playfully 
pokes at corporate identity and often 
features the pink and purple hues 
present in this year’s show.
The second source of inspiration 
is modern masculinity’s relationship 
to the tropes that continue to define 
it. Describing the collection’s archi-
tecture on their YouTube channel, 
the brand asserts that “Stereotypes of 
masculine character are challenged 
through tailoring, fabric and print — 
an interpretation of 
confidence through 
Versace’s maximal-
ist style,” and that 
“The Versace man is 
free to self-express 
with no limitations.” 
It is evident that Ver-
sace not only seeks to 
challenge masculin-
ity, including about 
as many women in 
the show as men and 
pairing emblems of 
virility with color 
palettes and style 
elements that cue 
the unmasculine; it 
mobilizes the irony 
and playfulness of 
those now defunct, yet massively 
influential art forms to inspire the 
same attitude toward the modes of 
social enforcement that attempt to 
dictate what brings us joy, how we 
view ourselves and how we present 
ourselves to others.
Versace is so ubiquitous that it 
doesn’t need to go out of its way to 
sell itself as a brand or try to invent 
something new. The groundwork 
has already been laid for that — the 
brand literally spawned Google 
Images. Much like Chanel and other 
labels of its stature, the house shines 
brightest when it finds new worlds 
to merge with and integrates estab-
lished designs. In doing so, they’re 
taking every aspect of what they have 
come to be known for, a decade that 
they have become synonymous with, 
a creative movement that more or less 
owes its whole self to both, synthesiz-
ing a politics and communicating it 
clearly, which is about as much as 
anyone could ask for.

Before Dr. Katie Bouman became 
the center of a social media firestorm, 
she would sit in “the bullpen” of DB 
Cafe on the University of Michigan’s 
North Campus with fellow members 
of HKN, an electrical, computer and 
computer science engineering frater-

nity, and eat “way too much Domino’s 
pizza.” 
About ten years later, Bouman hit 
“go” on her computer at Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology’s Com-
puter Science & Artificial Intelligence 
Lab to reveal a ring-shaped image 
warped around a backdrop of hot gas. 
A previously unseeable mass, Bou-
man captured the first ever image of 
a black hole, a product of an algorithm 

she helped develop with a team of 
more than 200 scientists.
“I was going between the shock 
that we were getting this — I think I 
really expected things to go wrong,” 
Bouman said. “Although I didn’t want 
to say that out loud, I expected things 
weren’t going to work the first time. 
Going between that, we had to keep 
pinching ourselves that this was real. 
I was going through these emotions 

of disbelief, awe and being afraid it 
might even be fake.”
Bouman was fascinated with sci-
ence from a young age. Almost every 
year starting from the sixth grade, 
Bouman would compete in the junior-
senior high school science fair in West 
Lafayette, Indiana. A few years later, 
as a junior in high school, Bouman 
began conducting image research 
at Purdue University with a group 
of graduate students. At Purdue, 
she aided in the students’ research 
attempting to figure out if they could 
pinpoint from invisible signatures 
which type of camera took which 
image.
Coincidentally, at Purdue, Bouman 
used the same computational device, 
the Event Horizon telescope — a glob-
al array of telescopes coming from 
the South Pole, Chile, Spain, Mexico 
and the United States — as she would 
work with years later to capture the 
first image of the Messier 87 black 
hole.
Because of this work at Purdue, 
Bouman decided it fitting to pursue a 
degree in electrical engineering at the 
University of Michigan. 
“You know, all the people in this 
lab were electrical engineers so I 
wanted to do this,” Bouman said. “I 
guessed I should just be an electrical 
engineer … I was kind of interested in 
images, signals and that kind of side of 
things from an early age. From that, 
that’s what made me decide to go into 
engineering and do research.” 
However, Bouman theorizes her 
early work at Purdue wasn’t the only 
rationale behind her career path. 
It really boils down to biology, she 
admitted. Her father, brother and sis-
ter are all accomplished engineers. 
“It’s one of those things where, as 
a kid, I wanted to be as different from 
my dad as possible,” Bouman said. 
“I think that I thought I was doing 
something very different from him, 
I didn’t really know what he did. I 

knew he was in electrical engineering 
but I didn’t know details on what he 
worked on. Initially, I was doing more 
stuff in the computer vision realm. 
But as I got older, I think biology took 
over, whether that is good or bad, I 
don’t know.”
In 2008, Bouman moved into 
East Quad Residence Hall, a part of 
the Michigan Research Commu-
nity — now the Michigan Discovery 
and Scholars program — and began 
attending 101 classes for her project-
ed degree, electrical engineering. At 
the end of her first year, she received 
the William Harvey Seeley Prize, an 
award given to an electrical engineer-
ing freshman first in their class. 
Clayton Scott, University of Michi-
gan professor of electrical engi-
neering and computer science, cites 
Bouman as the first student whose 
name he remembered in his probabil-
ity class. 
“She answered questions well, and 
asked her own challenging questions 
of me in return,” Scott wrote in an 
email to The Daily. “Her questions 
indicated a clear interest in not only 
learning the basic course content, but 
in applying and extending it in new 
directions.”
After graduating from the Uni-
versity in 2011, Bouman moved to 
Cambridge, Massachusetts to pursue 
a masters degree and eventually a 
post doctoral degree in both electri-
cal engineering and computer science 
at MIT. About two years after her 
arrival at MIT, she joined the Event 
Horizons Telescope project with no 
previous knowledge on black holes.
“I kind of stumbled across the proj-
ect,” Bouman said. “My advisor was 
going to give a talk to the group and so 
I went with him and was looking for 
new ideas or projects to get into.”

To Shimla, through Guava Island, with love

The artists that find a way to 
reinvent themselves with every 
project they put out are some 
of the most exciting to watch. 
After a while, it’s quite easy to get 
bored listening to the same song 
repeatedly or to music that you 
can’t relate to at all. This is what 
I enjoy about Donald Glover as an 
artist. He always manages to cre-
ate new art while being relatable 
and sticking to a common under-
lying theme. It’s like his signa-
ture as an artist which makes it 
authentically his.
I would not have expected for a 
funk and jazz album like Awaken, 
My Love! to follow projects like 
Because The Internet or STN MTN 
/ Kauai, which fit more under the 
rap and pop genre. I also would 
not have expected the actor that 
played the lovable and animated 
Troy Barnes on “Community” to 
play a more serious and painfully 
realistic Earn Marks on “Atlanta”. 
 
Glover’s latest project is his short 
film, “Guava Island”, in which he 
co-stars with Rihanna and Letitia 
Wright.
Most of the reviews that I read 
for this project have been positive 
but there are a handful of them 
that have described it as a great 
Childish Gambino music video 
but a bad movie. While Glover 
does use this film to provide visu-
als for his most recent songs, I 

believe that this short film wasn’t 
made to be a traditional award 
winning film; instead, it was 
made to prove a point and to send 
a message. 
The film circulates around the 
Glover’s character Deni Maroon 
and his love for his home Guava 
Island through its art, music and 
culture. Deni stands for artis-
tic freedom while Guava Island 
is ran by an oppressive body of 
power lead by the main antago-
nist, Red. A thought-provoking 
and critical scene that resonated 
with me was when Deni walks 
into his shift late and overhears 
his co-worker talking about mov-
ing to America and opening his 
own business.
Essentially, he talks about liv-
ing the American Dream. Deni 
scoffs at his co-workers dream 
and points out that America is a 
“concept” and that Guava is no 
different. “We live in paradise 
but we don’t have the means to 
live here”. To be honest, Deni has 
a very valid point here.
For ages, the concept of the 
“American 
Dream” 
has 
been 
sought after and idealized by 
many immigrants. People immi-
grated to America based on the 
thought of opportunity and free-
dom. The opportunity to start a 
family and get a well paying job 
and more importantly to be in a 
position to give their kids more 
opportunities 
than 
they 
had 
growing up. And the freedom 
to live as you want to and more 

importantly in a place that toler-
ates different schools of thought.
However, recently the “Ameri-
can Dream” seems to be a bit 
overrated and honestly under-
delivers on many promises. We 
live in a country where mass 
shootings of schools and places 
of worship have become a com-
mon occurrence. We live in a 
country where undocumented 
migrant families are placed cages 
and forced to live in unsanitary 
conditions while our president 
has some sort of fascination 
with building a wall (and scarily 
enough has a sizable proportion 
of the American population who 
agree with him).
I really could write a couple of 
paragraphs more about the scary 
reality that is America, but that 
would just turn this into a rant. 
And to be honest, I can’t defame 
the American Dream that much 
because I’m kind of living it right 
now. If my parents didn’t believe 
in it, I probably wouldn’t have 
the majority of the opportunities 
I have today. I also acknowledge 
that these are my opinions and 
that everyone is entitled to their 
own. But I think that a promi-
nent thing that we should take 
away from art such as Glover’s is 
that we should all be a little more 
aware of the world that we live in 
and more importantly is that we 
should ask more questions and 
have more discussions about it.
Throughout the film, Deni 
takes every opportunity he’s 

DEVAK NANUA 
Summer MiC Managing Editor

given to convince the audience 
that life on Guava still has the 
potential to be paradise.Deni 
demonstrates Guava’s potential 
by performing many Childish 
Gambino songs in a more simplis-
tic and stripped down way. For 
example, “Feels like Summer” is 
performed with a simple three 
chord loop on the acoustic gui-
tar and “This is America” seems 
to have its background track as 
noises from a working factory. At 
the same time all of these songs 
are given background visuals that 
show off the islands natural beau-
ty and vibrant colors.
***
I originally started writing this 
because while watching this film, 
Deni reminded me a lot of my 
brother, Abhi. He’s actually my 
first cousin, but to compensate 
for being an only child and for 
living in a different country from 
the rest of the family, my mother 
and my aunt raised me, Abhi and 
my cousin/sister, Kushu, as sib-
lings.
We 
built 
our 
relationship 
through my frequent trips to 
India over summer break. As a 
kid, Abhi’s head was dispropor-
tionately big for his body. He was 
quick to flash a smile, as he was 
always up to something. I was 
often an accomplice to his mis-
chief, much to the dismay of the 
rest of the family. Abhi is from 
a small town called Palampur 
in Northern India. It’s close to 
Dharamsala, the city where the 
Dalai Lama lives. It’s also men-
tioned in “Oxford Comma” for all 
of you Vampire Weekend fans out 
there.
Palampur is sort of in a valley 
and is surrounded by a lot of hills. 
It’s a great vacation spot but it’s 
sort of detached from the busy 
metropolises that sprawl across 
India. For some reason, as an 
elementary schooler, I couldn’t 
imagine living in such a small 
town. But to my comfort, at the 
end of each vacation Abhi would 
always reassure me that one day 
he’d move to the United States.
He would always crack a 
goofy smile as we waved good-
bye to each other. The last time 
I saw Abhi was last summer, as I 
returned to India after six years. 
The once short and smiley kid 
that I once knew was completely 
unrecognizable. He’s around 6’ 1’’ 
now and more of an introverted 
brooder. If Drake’s music was a 
person, that pretty much sums up 

my brother.
There were moments during 
my trip when my brother became 
a little more recognizable, but 
this was mainly through the lack 
of coordination he possesses with 
his tall frame. He’s going through 
his first year of college in a town 
called Shimla, which is away from 
home. Therefore, my aunt can’t 
really keep up with him as fre-
quently as she did. Considering 
that I hear about his whereabouts 
from my mother, who hears it 
from my aunt, my reactions are 
pretty delayed
But with every piece of infor-
mation I get, it’s like I’m meet-
ing a new person. Recently, he 
won a personality contest which 
is exactly what it sounds like, I 
think? He also won a traditional 
dance competition with his dance 
team. Another thing that I picked 
up was that he’s kind of turning 
away from the notion of immi-
grating to America and instead 
would rather settle down in his 
hometown. Many of my fam-
ily members sort of scoff at my 
brother like he’s going through 
a phase or that his hobbies take 
away from his time for school 
work.
To be honest, I also thought 
that my brother had sort of lost it. 
But it’s only recently that I real-
ized two things. The first is that 
I should be proud of my brother 
trying to give back to his home-
town. He sees something in those 
people that no one else could pos-
sibly see and as long as he’s pas-
sionate about his work and happy 
where he is, there really is no rea-
son for him to chase the Ameri-
can Dream. The second is that the 
artist that finds a way to reinvent 
him or herself with every project 
that they put out are some of the 
most exciting to watch.
My brother is in the process of 
reinventing himself and I can’t 
wait to see what he becomes. 
I should also mention that he 
turned 19 last week. This is sort of 
a belated birthday gift (sorry). So 
as your older brother, by a whole 
year I offer these words. Good 
luck on your journey to become 
the sort of man that you want to 
be. But always remember that to 
me you’ll always be that kid who 
always seemed to find a way to 
make the ordinary extraordinary 
at our grandparent’s house in 
Delhi. And not to forget the kid 
who mistakenly drank insecticide 
thinking it was sprite.

Jordan Poole selected in first round by Golden State Warriors

BROOKLYN, 
N.Y. 
— 
When 
Jordan Poole declared for the NBA 
Draft after just two seasons, he had 
his fair share of detractors.
People said Poole was being 
rash. That he was leaving too 
early. That he would benefit from 
another year in college, that he 
was dooming himself to a career in 
Europe or the G League.
On Thursday night, Poole took 
the first step towards proving them 
wrong. The Golden State Warriors 
selected Poole with the 28th 
pick in the draft. He’ll be playing 
alongside Stephen Curry next 
season, making nearly $2 million 
on a guaranteed contract.
“I think it was just being able 
just to trust myself, follow my 
deams,” Poole said. “Just having 
hope and faith. That’s all I’m going 
to really say on that. Being able to 
be in the position I’m in now, I feel 
like I made the right decision.”
Poole is John Beilein’s last first-
round pick at Michigan, and by 

getting into the first round, extends 
Michigan’s streak to four years in a 
row with a first-round pick. Ignas 
Brazdeikis was also drafted, going 
to the Knicks in the second round. 
Charles Matthews slipped out of 
the draft after suffering an ACL 
tear during a workout.
At Michigan, Poole left a legacy 
by hitting a game-
winning 
shot 
against Houston in 
the second round 
of March Madness 
in 
2018. 
That 
win 
eventually 
propelled 
Michigan to the 
Final 
Four, 
and 
etched 
Poole’s 
name into program 
lore.
In his second year with the 
Wolverines, 
Poole’s 
play 
was 
marked by its inconsistency. He 
shot 36.9 percent from 3-point 
range, a key part of a team that set 
a program record for consecutive 
wins to start the season, but 
that number dropped to 32.7 

percent in conference play. In 
big games, particularly the Big 
Ten Tournament final against 
Michigan State, Poole struggled, 
and frustrated Beilein.
Any NBA team could have looked 
at Poole and seen an inconsistent 
gunner, or a gifted player who can 
play with or without the ball, and 
shoot it, too.
The 
Warriors, 
evidently, saw the 
latter.
“It’ll 
definitely 
be amazing,” Poole 
said 
of 
playing 
alongside Stephen 
Curry in Golden 
State. “Being able 
to know at the 
same time we’re 
out there doing the 
same thing, and they’re definitely 
going to teach me some stuff right 
away and they’re definitely going 
to invite me into the league.
“Being ready for all challenges, 
but more than anything just 
coming in ready to get to work and 
be excited.”

Fraisse promoted to assistant coach following Byron’s departure

After spending 15 months as 
a volunteer assistant, Jerome 
Fraisse has been named the 
Michigan volleyball team’s third 
full-time assistant coach since 
2015.
The move comes in conjunction 
with the departure of previous 
assistant coach Sean Byron, who 
agreed to become Marist’s new 
head coach in April.
“We are really excited to add 
(Fraisse) full time,” said head 
coach Mark Rosen in a statement. 
“He has a great skill set in terms 
of 
his 
coaching 
knowledge 
working with the setters. His 
personality and view of the game 
match our staff really well and 
makes him a great fit for our 
program.”
As a volunteer member of the 
staff in 2018, Fraisse crafted 
drills for the team’s setters 
and 
developed 
data-oriented 
gameplans. 
He 
crunched 
numbers and watched film on 
Data Volley and VolleyMetrics 
— two of college volleyball’s 
popular analytics services — 

to 
prepare 
the 
Wolverines’ 
scouting reports. From a modern 
analytical standpoint, Fraisse 
understands the numbers that 
go into running a successful 
offense.
As Rosen alluded to, Fraisse 
will 
assume 
Byron’s 
former 
role as the program’s setters 
coach. He inherits one of the 
Big Ten’s best setters in rising 
senior MacKenzi 
Welsh, who has 
tallied 
3,881 
career assists and 
an All-American 
Honorable 
Mention selection 
during her career.
The promotion 
marks 
Fraisse’s 
first 
full-time 
NCAA job at any 
level. That’s not 
for a lack of coaching experience, 
though, 
as 
he 
boasts 
an 
impressive overseas background.
Prior 
to 
arriving 
in 
Ann 
Arbor last year, Fraisse spent 18 
seasons coaching in France — 
three as the men’s head coach at 
Grenoble Volley University Club, 
five as an assistant with L’Asul 

Lyon Volleyball Club and 11 
between L’Arago Sète Volleyball 
Club, Volleyball Romans and 
L’ES Meylan Volleyball Club.
In addition to his coaching 
tenures 
with 
five 
separate 
clubs, Fraisse brings a wealth 
of national team experience to 
the Wolverines’ staff. While 
coaching 
for 
L’Asul 
Lyon 
Volleyball Club, he worked under 
former 
Italian 
national 
team 
head 
coach 
Silvano 
Prandi 
for five years. He 
managed tryouts 
for France’s U17 
and U20 programs 
in 2017 and 2007, 
respectively, and 
has 
coaching 
experience 
in 
Canada.
While coaching in France, 
Fraisse spent time recruiting 
European players interested 
in 
playing 
volleyball 
in 
America. This could bode well 
for Michigan’s international 
recruiting efforts, and with 
Byron gone, Rosen may not 
hesitate to call upon Fraisse in 

that regard.
As a player, Fraisse enjoyed 
a three-year professional stint 
with the Grenoble Volleyball 
Club from 1997-2000. Though 
he only saw time at middle 
blocker 
and 
outside 
hitter 
during his playing days, his 
20-plus seasons around the 

game make him a good fit to 
work with Michigan’s setters.
After losing Maddy Abbott 
to graduation, Fraisse will 
primarily work with Welsh, 
rising 
senior 
Katerina 
Rocafort 
and 
incoming 
freshman Madison Dowd in 
2019.

OMAHA, Neb — In February, 
no one thought 
Michigan’s 
season would 
end on June 
26th. No one 
thought 
it 
would get its 
first 
50-win 
season 
since 
1987 and beat 
the No. 1 team 
in the country 
twice on the 
road to go to its first College 
World Series since 1984.
And most of all, no one thought 
that the feeling of losing in game 
three of the College World Series 
final against the No. 2 team in the 
country would be disappointing.
But it is.
On Wednesday, the Wolverines 
watched Vanderbilt storm the 
field and celebrate its second 
national title in five years, 
coming back to win the last two 
games in a three-game series for 

the championship. They were as 
close as it gets. 
A team that squeaked into 
the NCAA tournament as one 
of the “Last Four In”, and that 
was discounted in Corvallis, Los 
Angeles and Omaha, shocked 
college baseball. 
Since the walkoff win against 
Illinois, Michigan went 12-5 
against some of the best teams 
in the country. A hit that lit a 
flame inside the hearts of the 
Wolverines propelled them to 
simply be better than all but one 
team. 
They showed how much they 
had improved by crushing Texas 
Tech, a team that dominated 
them in March. They showed 
they 
could 
bounce 
back 
from crushing losses against 
Creighton and UCLA with win-
or-go-home victories. 
Junior 
left-hander 
Tommy 
Henry dominated on the mound 
in his last two starts, throwing 
a complete game shutout and 

a game one win, respectively. 
Senior first baseman Jimmy Kerr 
turned red hot, launching seven 
of his 15 home runs in the NCAA 
tournament 
while 
capturing 
the attention of baseball with 
the story of his father and 
grandfather. 
Coach 
Erik 
Bakich 
beat 
possibly the most storied coach 
of college baseball, Mike Martin, 
in his last year, when the world 
was on Martin’s side. In the 
meantime, Bakich made tough 
calls that paid off, such as moving 
Jeff Criswell to the bullpen and 
dropping closer Willie Weiss. 
Over and over, interview after 
interview in Omaha, Bakich 
was asked what this meant for 
Big Ten baseball — for northern 
baseball. 
“The more we can do this, I 
think the more the Big Ten in 
baseball can continue to grow 
and be perceived as a major sport 
on par with some of the other 
major conferences in baseball,” 

Bakich said.
In disbelief, reporters would 
ask how the team got here, how 
Michigan beat the teams that 
it did. The focus was on how 
excited they were, not how good 
they were. 
Bakich never once said, “We’re 
just happy to be here.”

As improbable as it was, the 
Wolverines won their way to 
Omaha. They were playing better 
than every team they faced along 
the way. 
Michigan made it. It was a 
long, uneven road but the eyes 
of college baseball might have 
finally turned north.

Don’t let the end distract from Michigan’s run

Offense quiet as Michigan falls to Vanderbilt in CWS Finals

OMAHA, Neb. – It was almost 
enough.
Deft 
management 
from 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. A 
batting order that had been hot all 
postseason. 
All of these were almost enough. 
But Vanderbilt’s pitchers were 
just too talented, too experienced, 
and Michigan’s upstart offense 
wasn’t 
up 
to 
the 
task. 
The 
Wolverines recorded just 2 runs 
on 6 hits in a 8-2 loss to the 
Commodores.
“The last two days in the red 
zone, I haven’t gotten it done,” 
said senior first baseman Jimmy 
Kerr. “I’ve been striking out with 
runners on base, less than two 
outs, when my team needed me. We 
haven’t got the two-out RBIs that 
we did early on. We didn’t have the 
clutch hits that we got early on.”
In the top of the first inning, 
it looked as if Michigan’s lineup 
would stay hot in the postseason. 
Senior 
second 
baseman 
Ako 
Thomas, thrust back into the 

leadoff role he had occupied 
in years past after an injury to 
sophomore 
designated 
hitter 
Jordan Nwogu, cracked a single 
to left field to kick off the title 
game. He advanced to third on 
a single from sophomore center 
fielder Jesse Franklin and scored 
on an RBI single from junior right 
fielder Jordan Brewer, putting the 
Wolverines on top, 1-0.
But that was all the success 
that Michigan’s offense saw for 
several innings. A few walks saw 
some baserunners, but Vanderbilt’s 
pitching retired the lineup each 
inning with clinical precision. 
The Commodores didn’t allow a 
runner past second base for six 
straight innings. They struck out 
14 Wolverines on the day.
The 
Wolverines 
didn’t 
get 
another hit until the eighth inning, 
at which point Vanderbilt already 
led, 7-1, a chasm that proved too 
wide for Michigan to breach. The 
Wolverines tacked on another run, 
but it was too late. Their bats had 
been quiet for too long. 
Though they ended up totaling a 
respectable six hits on the night – 

just three short of Vanderbilt’s nine 
– they could not capitalize on the 
opportunities they got. Michigan 
left eight runners on base. And as 
a volatile Commodore lineup beat 

up the Wolverines’ pitchers, those 
were 
opportunities 
Michigan 
could not afford to lose.
“We just didn’t execute the 
way we were supposed to,” senior 

second baseman Ako Thomas said. 
“We were kind of on our heels the 
rest of the game, didn’t maximize 
our opportunities. But we fought 
our hardest out there.”

OMAHA, Neb — Michigan 
would not win the national 
championship. Instead, its run 
will be earmarked as another 
remarkable underdog run ruined 
by a perennial power. 
In game three on Wednesday, 
the Wolverines (50-22 overall) 
lost to No. 2 Vanderbilt (59-12) 
8-2. But the game seemed over by 
the fourth inning.
On short rest, Bakich went 
to 
junior 
right-hander 
Karl 
Kauffmann to bring home the 
championship. Early on, he was 
himself. Besides missing a pitch 
up high on Commodores’ Pat 
DeMarco, who hit it out of the 
park for a home run, he struck 
out five and was one out away 
from finishing his third inning.
But a walk, a single, another 
walk and a pitch that had the 
Michigan defense leaving the 
field but the umpire called it 
a ball led to a runner being 
walked in. His first pitch against 
Vanderbilt’s Stephen Scott was a 
two-run single, and just like that, 
the Wolverines were down 4-1. 
“Tonight most of the damage 
was done with two outs, and 
we were just getting that big 
hit, and we were stringing good 
offense together as a team,” said 
Vanderbilt 
centerfielder 
Pat 
DeMarco. “It was team offense 

tonight.” 
And then, similar to the first 
inning, the Wolverines went 
back to the dugout after leaving 
runners on base. They had the 
perfect opportunity to answer, 
to pull themselves back into 
the game, but when they made 
hard contact with the ball, it 
went straight to a Commodore 
defender.
Vanderbilt didn’t let off the 
gas and chased Kauffmann out 
of the game in the 
third inning after 
a leadoff walk, his 
fifth of the game. 
His final line was 
three 
innings-
pitched, five runs, 
five walks, and 
five strikeouts.
But 
nor 
was 
it 
sophomore 
right hander Jeff 
Criswell’s 
night 
who, despite striking out the 
first batter he faced, eventually 
let in two runs in the fourth 
inning, putting Michigan down 
6-1 heading into the fifth.
In the first inning, though, the 
game had a completely different 
picture: Ako Thomas, leading 
off in place of Jordan Nwogu, 
started the game with a single. 
Sophomore center fielder Jesse 
Franklin then singled to put 
runners on the corners before 
junior 
right 
fielder 
Jordan 

Brewer brought in Thomas, and 
it seemed like the floodgates 
were open with the score at 1-0 
and no outs. 
“We came out on the attack,” 
Thomas said. “I think it was 
three hits in a row, scored a run 
first. We just didn’t execute the 
way we were supposed to. We 
were kind of on our heels the rest 
of the game, didn’t maximize our 
opportunities. But we fought our 
hardest out there.”
Added 
Commodores’ 
shortstop 
Ethan 
Paul: “It was the 
first inning and it 
wasn’t like there 
was 
anything 
to really worry 
about. We all trust 
Mason. He’s going 
to give us a good 
outing. 
I 
think 
I just wanted to 
remind him that it’s a big park. 
I wanted him to work down in 
the zone and let our defense 
work. We trust each other in the 
infield, so we wanted to make 
some plays for him.”
But Vanderbilt ace Mason 
Hickman shifted into another 
gear, striking out the next three 
batters in the lineup and setting 
a tone that left the Wolverine 
offense 
unable 
to 
cash 
in. 
Hickman ended the game with 10 
strikeouts through six innings, 

walking three and allowing just 
one earned run. 
The game fell into a rhythm 
after the fourth as both pitchers 
gained control over the game. 
There would be no spark and 
no more rallies. Senior first 
baseman Jimmy Kerr’s hard hit 

fly ball would be caught one foot 
short of a home run and every 
line drive found a defender. 

Vanderbilt 
suffocated 

Michigan and at the end of 
the day, the Wolverines found 
themselves going home empty-
handed.
