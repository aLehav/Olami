STUDENT UIFE
" Survey data
paints portrait
of class of 2015

CIRP: Most
freshmen support
LGBT rights
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
For the Daily
Along with entrance exams
and campus tours, new stu-
dents at freshman orienta-
tion are required to complete
the Cooperative Institutional
Research Program survey, the
results of which were released
for 2011 yesterday, and showed,
among other things, that a
majority supported legalizing
gay marriage.
Administered by the Higher
Education Research Institute
- the graduate school of edu-
cation and information studies
at the University of Califor-
nia, Los Angeles - the survey
tracks behavioral and educa-
tional trends among incoming
college freshmen across the
nation.
One of the areas that the sur-
vey focused on is student opin-
ion on LGTBQ rights. Survey
data showed that 71.3 percent
of incoming freshmen nation-
wide believed that gay mar-
riage should be legalized, while
80.7 percent of the University's
incoming freshmen did.

The executive board of the
Central Student Government's
LGBT Issues wrote in a state-
ment to The Michigan Daily
that it was pleased with the
results of the survey regarding
the support of gay marriage.
"We now hope to see this
level of support reflected on
the state and national levels,"
the board wrote.
However, thesUniversity's
freshmen were less supportive
of affirmative action than their
national peers. In 2011, 42.1
percent of all freshmen were
in favor of preferential treat-
ment in college admissions to
students from disadvantaged
backgrounds, while at the Uni-
versity, 32.7 percent of fresh-
men were.
Malinda Matney, a senior
research associate at the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs, wrote
in a statement to the Daily that
she was not surprised that Uni-
versity students were less sup-
portive of affirmative action
than their peers.
"These debates have been
ongoing in the state of Michi-
gan media since before these
students started kindergar-
ten," Matney wrote. "They
have never known a time in
which this was not an issue of
active debate."

People began lining up for tickets to see President Barack Obama speak at 7:30 p.m. last night. Tickets will be distributed at 9 a.m. today.
Students swarm to Union
for tickets to see president

As of 2 a.m., about
1,000 line up in
Regents Plaza
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
The basement of the Michi-
gan Union reached capacity last
night as nearly 1,000 people lined
its walls with the hope of receiv-
ing tickets for President Barack
Obama's address at Al Glick Field
House tomorrow morning.

Students, faculty members
and Ann Arbor residents began
forming a line at about 7:30 p.m.
that stemmed from the Michi-
gan Union Ticket Office, reached
back toward the connector to the
West Quad Residence Hall and
wrapped around the food court,
U-Gos and Computer Showcase,
before students were forced to
relocate outside at about 1 a.m.
Tickets were scheduled to
be distributed from the ticket
office at 9 a.m., on a first come,
first serve basis. There was
a limit of one ticket per per-

son. The event tomorrow will
be Obama's second visit to the
University, following his Spring
Commencement address at
Michigan Stadium in 2010.
A Department of Public Safe-
ty officer on the scene said he
was there to "coordinate with
staff," and acknowledged there
were no security issues as of 1
a.m. The officer said the Union
would be evacuated at its regu-
lar closingtime of 2 a.m.
But, at about 1 a.m., a Union
employee announced to the
assembled crowd that they

needed to vacate the building
and line up outside.
"Unfortunately, we've
reached capacity, so we have
to move people outside early,"
the official told the hundreds of
people lined up. "So you guys -
when the other DPS officers get
here - please stay ina single file
line. I'm sorry we have to get out
early, we have no more space in
the Union."
After being forced from the
building, the crowd waited in

Though people often conjure
the image of long hypnotic ses-
sions on Sigmund Freud's couch
when imagining psychological
research, that picture isn't the

norm for modern day practice.
As research psychology has
continued to evolve over the
course of the last 40 years, so too
have the ethical guidelines over-
seeing such research. Psycholo-
gists at the university level are
bound by institutional review

Degree to award
degrees from
multiple schools
By ALEX O'CONNOR
For the Daily
In response to the rapidly
growing demand for educa-
tion in the fields of informa-
tion technology and public
health, the University plans
to launch a new Master's pro-
gram in Health Informatics

this fall.
The program will be direct-
ed by Charles Friedman, for-
mer chief scientific officer for
Health Information and Tech-
nology in the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Ser-
vices, and Meghan Genovese,
senior associate director of
Health Informatics. The pro-
gram will combine material
from both the School of Infor-
mation and the School of Pub-
lic Health, and offer students
the opportunity to obtain a
degree from both programs

- making it the only program
in the University for which a
degree will be attributed to
more than one school.
Genovese described Health
Informatics as the develop-
ment of methods and infor-
mation technology that
capitalizes on the digital
age by collecting, analyzing,
storing and communicating
health-related information.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
After three weeks,
21-year-old freed
by Syrian gov't
A 21-year-old who disappeared
for three weeks after returning to
Syria from suburban Detroit was
released by Syrian authorities
yesterday, his family said.
Obada Mzaik, who has citizen-
ship in the U.S. and Syria, had
flown to Damascus from Detroit
Metropolitan Airport on Jan. 3
but wasn't seen leaving an immi-
gration checkpoint.
An uncle in Michigan said
the Syrian government released
Mzaik to his father there yester-
day.
"We're grateful that he's back
with his family, and we're grate-
ful to the community for showing
support to the family during dif-
ficult days," Dr. Firas Nashef, a
dentist from the Detroit suburb of
Farmington Hills, said in a state-
ment.

MSU using $5.8M
Gates grant to
study child deaths
Michigan State University says
it's using a $5.8 million grant from
the Bill & Melinda Gates Founda-
tion to find the causes and seek
to prevent the death of children
from bacterial diseases in sub-
Saharan Africa.
The university says the project
aims to prevent what is the lead-
ing cause of death for children in
the region. The bacterial diseases
include pneumonia, sepsis and
meningitis and they kill more
people in the area than malaria.
The Nigeria-based project
involves collecting local data on
the diseases and promoting the
use and development of vaccines.
Lead researcher professor
Stephen Obaro says Nigeria, and
many of its neighbors trail the
developed world in dealing with
bacterialdiseases because of poor
diagnostic work and lack of access
to vaccines.
ATLANTA
Judges weigh case
of police officer not
hired due to HIV
A panel of federal judges
appeared skeptical yesterday of
the Atlanta police department's
decision to reject a job application
from an HIV-infected man.
The 40-year-old man sued
the city in 2010, claiming he was
denied a police officer job solely
because he has the virus. Atlanta
attorneys argued there are other
officers on the force with HIV
and the police department that
it has no blanket policy disquali-
fying candidates with the virus.
Gay rights groups and police
agencies are closely following
the case.
One of the three judges sig-

naled the lawsuit would likely
be sent back to a lower judge to
reconsider.
"I don't see how we can avoid
a remand in this case," Circuit
Judge R. Lanier Anderson said.
The judges will issue a ruling
later.

IAEA examines
Japanes reactors
A team of International
Atomic Energy Agency experts
is making its first inspection of
a Japanese nuclear power plant
that has undergone official
"stress tests" required after the
Fukushima disaster.
Today, the 10-member IAEA
team was inspecting two reac-
tors at the Ohi nuclear power
plant in Fukui prefecture in
western Japan.
Passing the test is one of sev-
eral steps needed to restart doz-
ens of idled nuclear plants.
Only four of Japan's 54 reac-
tors are currently operating,
so getting some back on line
would help Japan avoid a power
crunch.

Secular activists,
Islamists battle for
influence in Egypt
CAIRO (AP) - Hundreds
of thousands thronged major
squares across Egypt yesterday,
marking the first anniversary of
the uprising that toppled Hosni
Mubarak with rallies that laid
bare the divisions that have
replaced the unity of last year's
revolt.
Cairo's Tahrir Square, the
epicenter of the 18 days of pro-
tests against Mubarak, was
transformed into the focal point
of the rivalry between revolu-
tionary activists intent on show-
ing they can still mobilize the
street, and the Muslim Brother-
hood, who emerged as Egypt's
dominant political force after a
landslide victory in parliamen-
tary elections.
The secular activists want
continued protests to force the
immediateouster of the generals
who took power after Mubarak's
fall, saying they are just as dic-
tatorial as the former president.
The activists touted their pow-
erful turnout as a sign they can
pressure the Brotherhood, who
they fear will accommodate the
military in order to ensure their
own political dominance.
"I have hope that these
marches will bea message to the

Brotherhood as much as the mil-
itary council," said Sahar Abdel-
Mohsen, who walked 3 miles
(5 kilometers) in a giant march
across Cairo to Tahrir.
"We all know even if the
Brotherhood are strong, the
military council isstill stronger.
... What we all want is an end to
military rule," she said.
Both sides were intent on
bringing out as many supporters
as possible to show their weight
in a nation still reeling from the
aftershocks of Mubarak's ouster.
The Islamists got off to a
strong start, taking up positions
in the morning and claiming the
right to police the square, with
Brotherhood volunteers check-
ing the bags of those entering.
From a large stage with
10 loudspeakers, they blared
religious songs and chants of
"Allahu akbar," setting a tone of
celebration for what they called
the successes of the revolution,
particularly the newly elected
parliament.
But a dozen large marches
organized by secular groups
converged on Tahrir from vari-
ous parts of the city, chanting
"Down, down with military
rule!" and filling boulevards
as passers-by joined in along
the way. The "non-Islamists"
swarmed into the downtown
plaza before sunset, jam-
packing it to outnumber the
Islamists.

months of captivity
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
- Held captive since last fall, an
ailing American woman and a
Danish man are safely on their
way home after a bold, dark-of-
night rescue by U.S. Navy SEALs.
The commandos slipped into a

the hostages to freedom.
The raid's success was wel-

promise that if you work hard,
you can do well," Obama said
from a manufacturing plant.
He said most people don't have
unrealistic ambitions about
their economic future but they
do want to own a home, save
for retirement and "achieve
that small measure of an
American dream."
Obama spoke at the start
of a three-day tour of politi-
cally crucial states to sell
his 2012 economic policy
goals and pitch his presi-
dency to a divided public.
Fresh from his address to
a joint session of Congress,
Obama sought to boost his
ideas for more manufac-
turing on American soil by
showcasing a conveyor belt
component manufacturer in
Iowa and an Intel plant in
Arizona.
Running for re-election
against Republicans who've
questioned his economic
stewardship, the president
said he wants to restore the
basic promise of America,
"and it starts with manufac-
turing." Inside the factory,
speaking to roughly 300
workers and guests, Obama
was flanked by machinery
and a banner with his lat-
est slogan: "America Built
to Last."
Presidential travel fol-
lowing the State of the
Union is commonplace,
allowing presidents to tem-

porarily bask in the afterglow of
their prime-time performances,
milking their message before
key constituencies.
Obama will highlight energy
security today in Nevada and
Colorado and wrap up tomor-
row by pushing education and
training proposals at the Uni-
versity of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
Republicans have blasted
Obama for offering divisive pol-
itics and pushing a greater role
for government intervention in
people's lives. "Iowans are still
waiting for Obama to deliver on
the promises of his campaign
and his first term," said Repub-
lican National Committee
chairman Reince Priebus.
Obama shot back that Repub-
licans would prefer a world in
which people are left on their
own, saying he wants to lead a
nation in which hard work has
rewards.
"America is not about hand-

outs," he said. "America is about
earning everything you've got."
Obama toured Conveyor
Engineering & Manufacturing,
a small family-owned Cedar
Rapids company that builds
giant conveyor belt screws,
working primarily with the eth-
anol and food industries
The president is pushing
a litany of tax proposals that
he said would boost manufac-
turing jobs, from removing
tax deductions for companies
when they move their opera-
tions overseas to creating a new
tax credit to offset expenses
for moving operations back
to the U.S. Other proposals
included doubling tax deduc-
tions for advanced manufac-
turing, extending tax credits
for clean energy projects and
creating new tax credits to
encourage companies to relo-
cate in communities that suf-
fered a major job loss, like the
closing of a plant.

Making the call
The 'U' should implement medical amnesty
The University is likely not the only college in the coun-
try faced with the problem of underage drinking. To
address the issue, the state of Michigan upholds a law
that states an intoxicated minor seeking medical aid for an
underage victim of alcohol poisoning can be convicted for
Minor in Possession of alcohol. As a result, students often
ignore medical emergencies to avoid getting into legal trouble.
A new proposal put forward by the Central Student Govern-
ment calls for the implementation of medical amnesty at the
University, which would allow students under the influence
to call authorities to help others without fear of punishment
for doing a good deed. The implementation of this initiative
would allow students to respond quickly to emergency situa-
tions, seek help for others and ultimately save lives.

What has happened in recent years, we were
told a rising tide would lift all boats, but the
rising tide has lifted all yachts."
- Billionaire Warren Buffett said yesterday in an interview with
ABC News about growing income inequality in America.

CSG President DeAndree Watson
described medical amnesty as a "huge accom-
plishment" for the University that would give
students an incentive to seek help. A resolu-
tion in support of the medical amnesty pro-
gram was put forth and approved at the CSG
meeting Tuesday night. While the resolution
calls for the immunity of underage drinkers
attempting to help others, it has other pro-
visions, including online alcohol education
classes and meetings with the University's
Counseling and Psychological Services.
Medical amnesty initiatives are becoming
increasingly popular on college campuses. Cor-
nell University found that there was an increase
in calls for alcohol-related emergencies after
the implementation of the program. Without
the fear of being issued an MIP, more students
are taking prompt action to help a friend. Fines
and community service time - the general
consequences of an MIP - are often insuffi-
cient deterrents for students who have access
to alcohol. More importantly, fear ofsuch puni-
tive measures is certainly not worth the life
of another student. Medical amnesty policies
help students distinguish their own situation
from the condition of a fellow student in need
of medical attention. According to a 2009 arti-
cle in The Heights, Boston College's student

newspaper, medical amnesty programs have
been implemented at more than 90 other col-
leges and universities in the country.
University policies like the mandatory
AlcoholEdu course for incoming under-
graduates are only beneficial to an extent.
Students remain likely to make reckless and
ill-informed decisions, as shown by a 2007
University Student Life Survey, in which 52
percent of undergraduates reported that they
participated in binge drinking and 69 percent
reported that they had taken care of a drunk
person. The University should have a policy
that ensures the safety of students who are
dangerously inebriated as well as those who
look out for them.
Unfortunately, binge drinking is common
on many college campuses. Though under no
circumstances is such behavior encouraged,
any student attempting to aid another should
not be punished, regardless of their blood
alcohol content. A medical amnesty policy
would ensure a more timely reaction on the
part of an intoxicated student's peers and
would result in less hesitation before the vic-
tim is transported to a hospital. The Univer-
sity should implement the medical amnesty
policy because the safety of students needs to
be at the forefront.

RON AND DENISE LANCE I
The origins of a tradition

There's no right way to
experience museums
TO THE DAILY:
I would like to respond to what I thought
was an extremely condescending and acutely
insulting article by Lauren Caserta, "Context
adds an extra dimension to experiencing art,"
on Jan. 23. The article paints her readership
of Michigan students as a bunch of philistines
who need to be led up the steps of a museum
or auditorium by the nose. Of course context
changes the way a work of art is perceived
and understood. Tomes have been written
and paintings have been painted since the
17th century that throw into question the
very accuracy of perception, a viewing con-
text in itself. At the Paris Salon, paintings
that were thought inferior were placed way
up high so that they touched the ceiling, and
the superstars placed at eye-level.
Furthermore, Caserta ignores the 20th
century efforts made by artists like Allan
Sekula, who in the series "Aerospace Folk-
tales" created viewing spaces complete with
potted ferns and recorded audio that added
meaning and therefore dismantled slightly
the framed photographs from their seem-
ingly exalted position. Instead, I think that
Caserta sides with the arbiters of the Salon in
defending the institutional right of museums
in shaping our viewing experience, and that
she is all too impressed by the ritual and for-
malities of experiencing culture that these
authorities dictate. Did the author of this
article ever stop to think that art is not limit-
ed to the high art that is finally selected to be
in these highly exclusive arenas? And what
is to say about artists who consciously reject
such settings, such as sound-artist Max Neu-
haus's needle-in-a-haystack "Times Square"
sound, literally a low-pitched sound which
occupies a carefully sonically delineated
space near a subway exit in Times Square?
When Caserta sees a group of people huddled
around something, does she immediately
follow the "social prompts" that "[provide]
the cues that tell you you're looking at some-
thing that's meant to be meaningful?" Didn't
the Dadaists kill the idea of "meaning to be

meaningful" with automatism? Or with this
statement has Caserta brushed off their con-
tribution to art historycompletely?
Caserta makes me believe that we go to
museums as some kind of bourgeois obli-
gation, in search of something to say at
the next dinner party, or to experience a
commodity - "even the day-long museum
pass you paid for makes you feel as though
you're looking at something special." Fur-
thermore, the white walls, the "Hey! I'm in
a museum!"vibe as bearing on the meaning
of a work, is only applicable to the last 100
or so years of art making and falls into what
Robert Smithson-called 'the secular ambush
of art.' Before, say, the titanium backdrop
for early modernist works at Stieglitz's 291
gallery, works of art were NOT intended to
be placed in such deliberately hollow and
context-LESS vacuums. Malevich empha-
sizes this distinction himself when he dis-
played (originally, and not the way Caserta
described) "Black Square" for the first time
in 1915 in the corner of a ceiling, the place
traditionally reserved in the home for Chris-
tian idols, and thereby nullifying it. But the
dogmas of the past are only replaced by new
ones. The leaders of the French Revolution
founded the Louvre as a museum in 1793 so
that they could hold on to all the sumptuous
art objects they confiscated from church-
es and at the same time quarantine these
sacred objects in a meaningless void: the
museum as we know it today.
Folk art does not become art when a cura-
tor plucks a weathervane off of a barn and
puts it in a museum. It was a piece of art with
a story and a meaning and a purpose all the
while. I would like to read Caserta's article
and be excited about a work of art in a way
that would naturally incline her reader to
make the trek out to the museum and con-
sume the exhibition from the bottom up.
However, what we have here is a prescrip-
tion for the correct way to experience art and
that, I strongly believe, is entirely up to the
individual. And if you just think that muse-
ums are so novel and amazing, then you need
to get out more.

These days the "Blues Brothers Dance" is every-
where Michigan sports seem to be. And isn't it great
fun to see everyone, including sports greats like
Denard Robinson, having such a great time going crazy
for those brief minutes? No doubt it has quickly become
the latest in a long history of Michigan traditions.
Traditions are truly wondrous things, andhavingleft
the Ann Arbor campus ourselves almost 35 years ago,
it's become ever more curious to us just how they seem
to acquire a life energy all their own. But how many
people really know how this zaniness got its start?
Sadly, we believe that all too often, after a few short
years, no one remembers. Classes graduate and no one
pauses to commit the story to writing. Far too many
of today's deeply rooted traditions lack what journal-
ists might call the "back story" on how they came to
exist. For the past few years, we've had the pleasure
of watching a new tradition be born at the University,
and watch it spread across the various sporting events.
This time, however, we felt that the "back story" should
be written down and documented.
The birth of the "Blues Brothers Dance" mania is
recent enough that many people know its genesis is
rooted in Yost Ice Arena with the Michigan hockey
team. Go to any Michigan hockey game and it's the
highlight of the second intermission - it has been for
several years. In the past year or so, the Big House
has been rocking as the band blares out the song and
throngs of students and even arena staff and the crowd,
pump their fists and dance with delight. But just how
many remember how and when it started? Well, here's
that answer.
The atmosphere in Yost on any Friday or Saturday
night the hockey team is in town has long been unique.
Just ask the parents of any visiting team's goalie. The
cheers are special, the student body is bursting to let
off steam and the Hockey Pep Band has always been
more than willing and able to spice up to the mixture.
But in the 2008-09 season, a core of the student sec-
tion seated in Section 18 added a new member, and it
brought something new to Yost. The hockey cheers
have long colorful histories, but this new group kicked
their game up a notch as they began egging on the band
and its newly dancing director to add even more fre-
netic accompaniment to the antics. Visiting goalies,
parents and referees are the long-standing targets of

the student section.
The experience of being in Yost at game time is spe-
cial to those who follow Michigan hockey. Even the
Wall Street Journal took notice, voting the crowd in
Yost one of its notable "best." But this small core of
students worked hard each night to arouse and involve
others around them, and with their success came the
participation of even the working event staff. The pep
band had long played a spirited rendition of the Blues
Brothers song, but it became the channel of this ener-
getic student group for some newly invented craziness.
The new "Blues Brothers Dance" was introduced into
the student section repertoire by one student who con-
vinced his brother and others seated around himto join
in during this 2008-09 season resurgence. It shortly
became an event with a life of its own, and thankfully
intermission lasts only 20 minutes, or there would be
no telling to this day just how long it might go on.
Who were these kids? Well, the hard core member-
ship includes Jeff Lance and Mandy Siegle (an alumni
hockey pep band member). The important new ingre-
dient in 2008, however, was Kevin Lance, Jeff's young-
er brother. It was Kevin who introduced the punching
hand motions and the rest of the dance routine to the
Blues Brothers music the pep band had long been play-
ing. In the earlier versions, there were words to the
dance but they were soon dropped due to the frenzy
taken on by the dance itself. In those first days some
called it "Punch the Giant" as coined by Kevin, its cho-
reographer. It was quickly way beyond being identified
with any one person, however, and the effort of this
small initial core was swallowed up as all of Yostbegan
to feel that rush the minute the band fired up the tune.
Looking back, I wonder if perhaps this is what hap-
pened with so many of Michigan's other fine traditions.
After all, some one individual had to do it for the first
time, and many of those names are now lost to us. From
Yost, it took only a couple of seasons for the dance to
find its way to the Big House in a big way on the shoul-
ders of the band and some of these same hockey danc-
ers. There is no question the Big House and Crisler
Arena versions are fun, but for purists there is nothing
like the original being belted out in Yost by the hockey
pep band and the fans in Section 18.
Ron and Denise Lance are 1976 University alums.

The survey also showed that
University freshmen claimed to
have a higher workload in high
school than other freshmen. At
the University, 63.1 percent of
freshmen said they spent at least
six hours studying, whereas only
39.5 percent of freshmen across
the country said the same.
The survey also found that
46.4 percent of University fresh-

Advanced Placement courses in
high school, compared to 21.7

The Health Informatics pro-

techniques" of the School of
Information with the School of
Public Health's "knowledge of

as their ability to influence indi-
viduals to live more healthy life-
styles," Friedman said.

men who considered the Univer-
sity as their first-choice school.
In 2010, 68.9 percent of incoming
freshmen said the University was
their first choice, and in 2011, the
percentage dropped to 65.5.
Matney wrote in a separate
e-mail interview that the small
margin of difference shows
Michigan's continuing popular-
ity.
"What I take from this is that,
although a much larger num-
ber of students are applying to
Michigan, we are also the most
desired destination for a rising
number of students," Matney
wrote. "(The University) is spe-
cial in the aspiration of thou-
sands."
Authors of the study noted
that rising tuition costs and a
slowly growing economy con-
tributed to a rise in freshmen
debt levels across the country.
Survey data found that the per-
Parent commended Warner
for giving her the support and
independence to start a pro-
gram that joins families and
faculty.
"Families and staff adore
her," Parent said. "She's there
100 percent of the time and
makes herself available, as she
is responsive and truly listens to
their voice."
Scott Newport, a UMHS vol-
unteer and the parent of a former
patient, said he has immense
respect for Warner's longstand-
ing commitment to families over
the years.
"It's people like Pat War-
ner who are great leaders, and
"There is widespread agree-
ment that informational technol-
ogy will be vital in solving the
problems of the healthcare indus-
try," Friedman said.
School of Information Dean
Jeffrey MacKie-Mason said an
aging population and a wealthier
society have contributed to the
growing demand for educational
opportunities in health-related
information technology, and
careers in areas like health analy-
sis, hospital administration and
health insurance.
"Cost of health care will soon
become one of the single most
important expenditures in the
United States," MacKie-Mason
said. " ... It is because of this that
there are a lot more demands for
informational technology in the
healthcare system."

centage of all incoming freshmen
in the nation in 2011 who needed
$10,000 or more in loans to pay
for their firstyear of college more
than doubled the percentage in
2001, from 5.6 percent to 13.3
percent.
University freshmen, on the
other hand, exhibited the oppo-
site trend. In 2011, 3.4 percent
of University freshmen expect-
ed to use $10,000 or more in
loans, while in 2001, 5.6 percent
expected the same.
Matney wrote in the email
that the decrease in loans has
more to do with an increase in
financial aid from the University
rather than a change in the finan-
cial background of attending stu-
dents. She cited the University's
commitment to M-PACT, a finan-
cial aid program that increases
grants and decreases loans for
students in the Ann Arbor cam-
pus.
everything in those kinds of
institutions depends on leader-
ship," Newport said.
Newport said his appreciation
for Warner comes partly from
his gratitude for the doctors who
worked at Mott.
"We work with the doctors
and nurses on a daily basis, and
after all of the visits, we sit back
and appreciate the leadership
that they work under," Newport
said. "She encourages the staff
to be the best they can be. I'm
going to miss her."
UMHS spokeswoman Mar-
garita Wagerson said UMHS
will hold a national search for
Warner's replacement.
LSA senior Kyle Heckaman
wrote in an e-mail interview
that he is applying to the Health
Informatics program for the fall
because it will allow him to utilize
a variety of academic skills.
Heckaman added that he is
considering working in a hospi-
tal as an information officer, and
that a degree in Health Informat-
ics would help him use available
information to address deficien-
cies in the health care industry.
"After I realized that direct
patient care was not for me, I still
wanted to remain in a health-
related field, one that would allow
me to utilize the quantitative and
analytical skills I learned while at
studying biochemistry," Hecka-
man wrote. "A degree in health
informatics will allow me to do
both of those things."

REGULATIONS
From Page 1A
the majority of regulatory work of
psychological studies is done at
the departmental level by institu-
tional review boards. The boards
review proposals for experiments
before they're performed, con-
duct random audits on research-
ers and handle complaints from
participants against researchers
or particular studies.
"It is set up-solely to review
experimental procedures," Seif-
ert said. "The board has faculty
members from across the Univer-
sity, and they reviewthe proposed
procedures to see if they are ethi-
cal or not."
Seifert added that the boards
report to the federal government
if they find evidence of legal vio-
lations that cannot be handled
internally.
"The institutional review
board is there to guarantee that
researchers follow the ethical
principles outlined bythe (Ameri-
can Psychological Association)
and federal law about how partici-
pants can be treated in research,"
Seifert said.
Christine Moretto Wishnoff,
health program specialist at the
National Institutes of Health,
said the "Common Rule" - a
portion of the federal regulation
code on human research subjects
within the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services - is
the main federal law overseeing
experimentation. The rule also
mandated the establishment of
institutional review boards to bet-
ter protect volunteers in psycho-
logical experiments.
"The charge of the institutional
review board is to assess that risk
to subjects have been minimized
and that risks are reasonable in
relation to anticipated benefit,"
Wishnoff said.
The violations NIH deal
with are usually not very seri-
ous, Wishnoff said. Lapses in the
required yearly reviews are the
most common, but she said she
has never seen a study that would
seriously imperil subjects brought
to her office.
She added that a key criterion

for the funding that NIH pro-
vides for psychological research
is based on the ethical consider-
ations of the proposed experi-
ment.
"Typically when we look
at studies that would result in
duress, we would make sure there
is an evaluation of whatever the
research would be," Wishnoff
said. "Issues of subject protection
and concerns are flagged at that
point (of the evaluation). A grant
cannot be paid until those con-
cerns are addressed."
Both Wishnoff and Seifert
agreed that the use of deception
and other misleading techniques
will continue to be necessary in
psychological experiments in
order to obtain honest results
from participants.
"The nature of science has
somewhat changed," Wishnoff
said. "There will always bestudies
that employ some level of decep-
tion or disclosing only certain
aspects of a study design."
Edward O'Brien, a Rackham
student who has conducted psy,
chological research in the past,
said potential ethical dilemmas
concerning psychological experi-
ments were clearly presented to
him, even during his undergradu-
ate years at St. Joseph's University.
Before he could conduct experi-
ments at the undergraduate level,
O'Brien said he had to take a sum-
mer course about experimental
ethics, and he was also required to
complete an online course at the
University of Michigan before he
was allowed to work with human
subjects.
O'Brien said he believes the
greatest ethical concerns facing
psychological research today are
not harm to the participant, but
rather the inadvertent revela-
tion of a participant's confidential
information or results from a test.
"Having personal information
like a cell phone number or an
e-mail address that the participant
didn't agree to give (are more of a
concern), as compared to the old
days like the 'shocking experi-
ment' (application of electric
shocks to participants) that would
physically harm the participant
(by giving them electric shocks),"
O'Brien said.

O'Brien added that institutional
review boards emerged informal-
ly at the Nuremburg trials after
World War II with the revelation
of Nazi experiments. Wishnoff
said these were formalized when
the Common Rule became law in
1991.
Beyond research psychology,
professional psychological care
also receives strictly enforced
regulation. The Michigan Board
of Psychology - whose members
are appointed by the governor -
regulates psychological treatment
and practices and oversees profes-
sional licensing.
Robert Hack, a limited license
psychologist and member of the
Michigan Board of Psychology,
said the board doesn't usually deal
with research issues, but instead
focuses on complaints against pro-
fessionals in the practice. If there
are reported violations against
psychologists, the complaint often
undergoes a process similar to that
of an institutional review board.
"(The complaint) goes to the
office in Lansing which asks us to
investigate and (also) the assistant
attorney general's office to investi-
gate violations," Hack said. "It'sup
to interpretation sometimes. Some
of it's relevant, but sometimes it's
just a therapist not really doing
what (the patient) wants them to
do."
LSA freshman Tonia Ballantyne
said she was required to partici-
pate in basic psychology experi-
ments for her Psychology111class.
Though some of the experiments
were handled professionally, she
said she was correctly debriefed
after, which she said she felt was
an ethical concern.
"(The researchers) had manipu-
lated certain variables, but they
never said what they were on the
debriefing form," Ballantyne said.
"I thought that was very contra-
dictory to what we had learned in
class."
The researchers were flustered
when they encountered a glitch
in their computer system, and
even admitted that their debrief-
ing form didn't say anything about
what the experiment addressed,
Ballantyne said.
"The professionalism was down
the drain at that point"

Peace talks between
Palestinians, Israel end

Abbas to consult
with other Arab
leaders
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)
- A low-level dialogue between
Israelis and Palestinians about
a future border has ended with-
out any breakthrough, the Pales-
tinian president said yesterday,
reflecting the impasse plaguing
the negotiations for at least three
years.
President Mahmoud Abbas
said he would consult with Arab
allies next week to figure out how
to proceed now. While frustrated
with the lack of progress, Abbas
is under pressure to extend the
Jordanian-mediated exploratory
talks, which the international
community hopes will lead to a
resumption of long-stalled for-
mal negotiations on establishing
a Palestinian state.
Israel said yesterday it's will-
ing to continue the dialogue.

Abbas didn't close the door to
continued meetings, saying he'll
decide after consultations with
the Arab League on Feb. 4.
A Palestinian walkout could
cost Abbas international sympa-
thy at a time when he seeks global
recognition of a state of Palestine
in the West Bank, Gaza and east
Jerusalem, the territories Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
The gaps between the lead-
ers are vast, and Abbas believes
there is no point in returning
to formal negotiations without
assurances, such as marking the
pre-1967 war lines as a basis for
border talks and halting Israeli
settlement building on occu-
pied lands. Israeli Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu says
everything should be discussed
in negotiations and insists he is
serious about reaching a deal by
year's end.
Though there have been talks
off and on, the last substantive
round was in late 2008, when
Israel informally proposd a deal

and the Palestinians did not
respond. When Netanyahu took
office the next year, he took the
proposal, including a state in
most of the territories the Pales-
tinians claim, off the table.
A round started in late 2010 by
President Barack Obama quickly
sputtered over the settlement
issue.
Visiting EU foreign policy
chief Catherine Ashton is sched-
uled to meet separately over the
next two days with Abbas and
Netanyahu to try to salvage the
exploratory talks. Two officials
involved in the contacts said she
is trying to put together a pack-
age of Israeli incentives that
would keep the Palestinians from
walking away.
"We need to keep talks going
and increase the potential of
these talks to become genuine
negotiations," Ashton said.
Under Jordanian mediation,
Israeli and Palestinian envoys
have met several times over the
past month, including yesterday.

Teman Evans, a lecturer in the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, began lining up for tickets to see
President Obama speak at 7:30 p.m.

Kelly Clarkson receives
backlash for endorsement

Fans say singer
ignored states
rights issues
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Pop
singer Kelly Clarkson wasn't
expecting such a harsh response
when she tweeted her endorse-
ment in the Republican presiden-
tial race.
"I love Ron Paul," she wrote
late last month. Later, in a radio
interview, she elaborated, "He
believes in states having their
rights, and I think that that's
very important."
Clarkson received hundreds
of replies, some lambasting Paul
and at least one suggesting that
the "American Idol" winner
choose her words more carefully.
In particular, two words:
"states" and "rights."
As the Republican presidential
campaign has turned south, into
the region that seceded from the
Union 150 years ago, old debates
about state and federal author-
ity echo anew in phrases used by

candidates, their supporters and
the news media.
Even before the Civil War,
"states' rights" had become a
byword for the protection of
black slavery. And since the late
Sen. Strom Thurmond ran for
president in 1948 as a States'
Rights Democrat, or "Dixie-
crat," the phrase has sometimes
been labeled a "dog whistle" for
racist elements in the elector-
ate.
None of that was on Clark-
son's mind. After a barrage of
responses to her Dec. 29 tweet,
the 29-year-old Texan told fans,
"My eyes have been opened to
so much hate." And she empha-
sized, "I do not support racism."
Sociologist and author John
Shelton Reed, a professor emeri-
tus at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, was not
surprised that someone of Clark-
son's youth would fail to recog-
nize the "baggage that 'states'
rights' carries."
Still, he says, hearing the term
employed by people like Paul
- and also by Texas Gov. Rick

Perry before he quit the race
- "it's clear that we've turned
some kind of page."
Paul, Perry and others
referred to the Constitution's
10th Amendment, which states,
"The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitu-
tion, nor prohibited by it to the
States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people."
The shorthand "states' rights"
came later.
"Any time I hear it, I get this
sort of little twitch, because I
associate it with Ross Barnett or
George Wallace," says Univer-
sity of Georgia historian James
Cobb, referring to the governors
of Mississippi and Alabama who,
five decades ago, defied efforts
to integrate their states' flag-
ship universities. "But members
of the younger generation, it
doesn't have that kind of conno-
tation to them at all. And wheth-
er this is to some extent the fault
of those of us who are supposed
to be educating the younger gen-
erations about their past, I can't
say."

From Page 1A
Regents Plaza, around the Cube
and toward the Fleming Admin-
istration Building.
Cars traveling on South State
Street in the wee hours of the
morning honked enthusiastical-
ly, elicting cheers from students
waiting in the plaza who were
camping out in tents and sleep-
ing bags.
Architecture lecturer Teman
Evans, the first person in line,
said he decided to come get
tickets since they were open
to the community, and wanted
the chance to see the president
speak.
"I figured that it's a great
opportunity," Evans said.
Ann Arbor resident Andrew
Porter-Price was sitting out-
side an exterior door before the
Union vacated, in hopes of being
at the front of the line when offi-
cials evacuated the building.
Porter-Price said the Univer-
sity is a good location for the
president to visit due to its dedi-
cation to help improve the state's
struggling economy.
"It's the flagship institution
of the state and he's had a lot
of work with Michigan over
the past three years so it makes

sense." Porter-Price said. "It's
a good start on the campaign
trail."
LSA sophomore Joanna Harr
said she was prepared to wait for
more than eight hours with her
friends for a ticket.
"We brought a blanket and
we're going to take a nap," Harr
said. "We brought backpacks full
of clothes, we're readyto bundle."
While some described the
waiting students as overzealous,
LSA sophomore Elizabeth Barns
said camping out was a unique
experience.
"It's college, you're suppose to
do crazy things like this," Barns
said.
LSA sophomore Shelby
Hawkins said her friend who
lives in West Quad was plan-
ning to bring a futon out into the
plaza.
"You can call me crazy, but
I'm going to be watching Obama
on Friday, and where are you
going to be?" Hawkins said.
LSA freshman Neil Patel said
he joined the line because "it's a
one-time opportunity" to watch
the president speak, adding that
its monumental for Obama to
visit the University twice in the
span of two years.
"These are the only chances

you get, and this is the second
time he's coming to the Univer-
sity of Michigan," Patel said. "It's
just a big thing. Not a lot of uni-
versities get to see the president
and twice, which is abigmatter."
LSA freshman Lindsay John-
son said she was surprisedby the
size of the crowd and the perse-
verance of the students waiting
in line.
"I'm pretty impressed with ...
our dedication right now," John-
son said. "A lot of people were
like, 'Oh, we're going to be hard-
core and go at 4 a.m.' We got here
at 11:30 (p.m.) and there were
already like 300 people ahead of
us."
Despite the long wait, John-
son said she wasn't concerned
about lack of sleep.,
"There aren't very many peo-
ple who can say, 'Oh, the presi-
dent of the United States came
to my school, and I camped out
for a ticket,"' Johnson said. "So
I figure in a few years I'm not
going to remember being sleep-
deprived, but I'll remember
watching the president speak."

Wolverines look for
redemption at home
against Penn State

FILE PHOTO/Daily
Former Michigan forward Brian Wiseman celebrates a goal in his senior campaign in January 1995. Wiseman scored 413 goals in a season as a 10-year-old.
Wiseeman remembers 413-goal year,
legacy as Canadian hockey prodigy

'M' assistant coach
made headlines
as goal-scoring
phenom
By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
You've probably heard about
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson's phenomenal six-
goal game with the St. Louis
Blues in 1968. But what about
the record-breaking season of
one of his assistants, who aver-
aged over five goals per game en
route to a 413-goal campaign?
"They didn't even keep those
stats when I was a kid," Beren-
son said.
About nine years after that
magical season, when Berenson
began to recruit Brian Wiseman
to join the Michigan program,
he couldn't avoid hearing the
legend of the Canadian center
who went from typical adoles-
cent to national prodigy.
Wiseman, now a Michigan
assistant coach, was 10 years
old at the time. And no, his
opponents weren't half his age.
In fact, after Wiseman - then
a rising star in the hockey-hun-
gry town of Bothwell, Ontario
- rewrote the record books, he
joined his older brother's team,
who's three years older.

"There was no secret about
Brian Wiseman when we
recruited him," Berenson said.
"He was gifted all the way up....
We knew this kid was prolific."
The winter of 1981 is one
Wiseman won't ever forget.
The national media probably
came calling at about the time
Wiseman scored 17 times in a
single game. Believe it or not, he
wasn't shooting on an empty net
all night.
Local papers took notice
first. But it wasn't long before
Don Cherry wanted to meet the
youngster. So Wiseman went
to Toronto for Hockey Night
in Canada - a wide-eyed boy
excited to meet some of hock-
ey's best, and viewers anxious
to meet a kid with a knack for
scoring goals.
"It was quite the interesting
season, to say the least, with
some of the production that I
was able to achieve," Wiseman
said. "I was a 10-year-old in
some different situations that
a normal 10-year-old wouldn't
be in."
Wiseman adjusted to life as a
child star. He couldn't compre-
hend the novelty of it all, doing
his best to look as comfortable
and answer as professionally
in front of the camera as a kid
in fourth grade possibly could.
Wiseman's penmanship also
had to adapt to his new lifestyle
- autographs were just part of

the gig.
But the highlight of the
season wasn't appearing in a
national hockey magazine or
even meeting the eccentric
Cherry. It was when Wiseman
met the man whose record he
broke. You may have heard of
him - Wayne Gretzky. "The
Great One" once scored 378
goals in a season. It was a nov-
ice-level record never to be bro-
ken - or so everyone thought.
But Wiseman made it look like
child's play, and Gretzky had to
meet the kid that left him in his
dust.
While Gretzky was busy win-
ning Stanley Cups and MVP
awards, he took time off to
meet Wiseman. Wiseman can't
remember any specific words
of wisdom Gretzky had to pass
along, but said Gretzky didn't
have any hard feelings over
having his record snatched
away. The meeting is something
that Wiseman will remember
forever.
"(He) flew to my hometown
for a baseball charity event,"
Wiseman said. "I was then
introduced to him and we had
some time together."
His teammates also reaped
the benefits of playing along-
side the prodigy. An opposing
team, eager to test itself against
the scoring prowess of Wise-
man, flew his team out to New
Brunswick for a series.

"We did a lot of different
things because of...,",Wiseman
hesitated, "my goal production,
I guess."
When you're 10, you don't
understand why the world is
the way it is. To Wiseman, he
was just another kid - the
phone at home just rang a little
more with media requests and
he went off to press conferences
while others were finishing up
homework.
"You just ... do it," Wiseman
said. "Answer a couple ques-
tions - probably not intelli-
gently, obviously, as a 10-year
old. It was kind of fun. ... But it
was obviously not your normal
10-year-old going to the rink to
play hockey."
Obviously. And though play-
ers eventually "caught up," as
Wiseman says, he remained a
good enough scorer to catch
Berenson's eye. Many under-
sized scorers go unrecruited,
but Wiseman was a special kind
of sniper.
Today, he leaves the auto-
graph signing to the athletes
he coaches and the press con-
ferences to Berenson. But the
childhood he enjoyed, along
with the 413 goals he notched
that season, remain extraordi-
nary.
"I did some good things when
I was younger," Wiseman said
sheepishly.
Yeah, 413 of them.

" Athletic Department dispels OHL rumors

OHL team source
says alternate
rink location in
Detroit likely
By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
Rumors swirling that an
Ontario Hockey League double-
header would be played next
winter at Michigan Stadium in
conjunction
with the First reported on
NHL's Win-
ter Classic MichiganDailycom
are "not
true," Associate Athletic Direc-
tor David Ablauf told the Daily
Wednesday morning.
A Tuesday-evening tweet from
* a London, Ontario reporter cover-
ing the OHL said that the outdoor
doubleheader was confirmed and
would be played at the Big House
on Dec. 31.

Since then, an OHL source
with one of the teams involved
informed the Daily that the
league is, in fact, planning an out-
door doubleheader. The source
went on to name Detroit's Comer-
ica Park as the most likely venue.
While an official announce-
ment hasn't been released by
either the Michigan Athletic
Department or the NHL regard-
ing the Winter Classic, the
Detroit Free Press confirmed
earlier this month that the event
would, indeed, be held at the Big
House.
A major sticking point remains
as to whether any smaller events
will supplement the Winter Clas-
sic. It now seems likely that any
other games to be played would
take place at an auxiliary venue.
The speculation is just the lat-
est in the outdoor frenzy sweep-
ing all levels of hockey. Just two
weeks ago, the Michigan hockey
team faced off against Ohio State
at Progressive Field in Cleveland
for the Frozen Diamond Faceoff.

8A - Thursday, January 26, 2012 The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
Burke, Sullinger reunite in Columbus

DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke is used to providing for
others. On the court, he provides
point-scoring opportunities for
his teammates, and off the court,
he is used to hosting friends, like
Ohio State forward Jared Sull-
inger.
*But this weekend, Burke will
have to enter unfamiliar territory:
Sullinger's house.
OK, so Value City Arena isn't
Sullinger's real home, and Colum-
bus - the childhood home of both
Burke and Sullinger - won't be
all that unfamiliar to Michigan's
point guard, either.
But this Sunday's Ohio State-
Michigan matchup allows Sull-
inger to finally host his childhood
best friend in his own confines.
"He'd always be at my house,"
Burke said. "I really didn't go over
his house as much as he came over
mine. There was a couple times
where he would stay over my
house for, you know, five to six days
straight."
Sullinger felt so at home in the
Burke house that he kept sets of
clothes there.
Burke and Sullinger became
best friends when Burke was in
fourth grade. Sullinger - a year
older than Burke -joined the point
guard's AAU team, coached by
Trey's father Alfonso. The Burkes
had high expectations for Jared,
whose brother J.J. was playing for
Arkansas. But at first glance, Jar-
ed's physique didn't seem to match
J.J's stature.
"I knew who J.J. Sullinger was,"
Burke said. "Once I saw (Jared), he
was kind of short, like fat, kind of."
The first impression of Sullinger
as unathletic quickly went by the
wayside. It was soon obvious that
he had talent.
"He could play," Burke said.
"Really, couldn't no one stop him
down low. Even though he was out
of shape, hehadgoodfootworkand
he could finish around the rim."
Burke and Sullinger went on

Freshman guard Trey Burke grew up playing alongside Ohio State center Jared Sullinger. They have played together countless times, but head-to-head just three times.

Sullinger. When Burke continued
to have success, people overlooked
him and said his game wouldn't
translate as well into college.
When Burke finally did commit
to play for the Wolverines, the
opportunity to prove his doubters
wrong was surely a factor in his
mind.
"Once I got here to Michigan,
I saw that this was the best deci-
sion for me and the best place for
me to be, I took it," Burke said.
"And I knew that Ihada chance to
play against them, so it was what
it was."
Burke said family and friends
have been blowing up his phone
with requests for tickets. Players
receive just two tickets for road
games, but Burke said fellow Wol-
verines like sophomore forward
Colton Christian - a native of
Washington - have offered Burke
their tickets.
Burke admitted that his
thoughts have drifted toward
what the crowd will be like and
knows there will be plenty of folks
with mixed emotions during the
40-minute contest.
"I don't really know, honestly,"
Burke said. "Just playing back
in Columbus, my hometown, it's
going to be kind of - I wouldn't
say weird, but it's just going to be
different. There's going tobe a lot
of people that are Ohio State fans
there that I know really well and
they just want to see me do well,
but want to see us lose."
The freshman said that, like all
games, his adrenaline will be rac-
ing in the first few minutes and
that he'll be eager to drive into the 9
paint. In that paint will be a famil-
iar face in an unfamiliar setting.
But if history has taught us a les-
son, don't expect it to faze Burke.
"It definitely won't be weird,"
he said. "It's going to be so com-
petitive. He's going to want to
win so bad and I'm going to want
to win so bad, so it's going to be a
good matchup.
"After my first three or four
minutes in Columbus, I'm pretty
sure I'm going to be relaxing."

to form a dynamic duo and made
headlines that rippled far outside
of Columbus. In the offseason,
they played AAU together until
high school, when Trey stopped
playing an age up. And in school
they became a force, eventually
bringing Northland High School a
state title in Sullinger's senior year.
Some rankings tabbed the team as
the nation's best.
Burke fumbled for words when
asked on Wednesday how many
games they've played together.
"I don't think I could count,"
he said. "It's probably over a thou-
sand."
But how many times have they
gone against each other on the
court? Burke estimated only three
times, and all of those came during
scrimmages in practice. However,
like all best friends, their off-the-
court rivalry brought Burke to
laughter as he reminisced their
childhood.

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.

"Archer"
Tonight, tune in to the best raunchy animated
series on television: "Archer." Airing on Thursdays
at 10 p.m. on FX, "Archer" follows Sterling Malory
Archer (codename: Duchess), the world's biggest
asshole and the best international spy in the biz.
On Friday, check out Daily Arts's blog, The Filter,
for a recap that promises to be as explosive and
vulgar as the show.
"Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"
Seth Grahame-Smith
Anybody ready for some political badassery? No,
I'm not talking about Obama's speech tomorrow
(though that too), I'm talking about "Abraham Lin-
coln, Vampire Hunter," a novel by Seth Grahame-
Smith. With a film adaptation set for a June release
this year, get in the mood for a presidential visit with
this definitive biography of one of America's greatest
leaders and most effective vampire executioners.
"We Need to Talk About Kevin"
In the mood for a darkly haunting flick featuring
a crazy little demon child? If you are, Arts recom-
mends the upcoming Tilda Swinton film "We Need
to Talk About Kevin." Apart from the superb acting
and fearless directing, nothing about the movie is
predictable. Even though we realize the inevitable
ending halfway through the movie, the script is fresh
and keeps us on the edge of our seats.

JEFF WARANIAK/Daily

"I.Need My Girl" - The National
"I Need My Girl" is a lovelorn ballad that can
silence crowds as quickly as a gunshot. When The
National revealed this track on CBC radio station
Q, not a sound was heard beside its thrumming
guitar riff and singer Matt Berninger's vulner-
able voice. This is the type of song that makes you
scared to sneeze. Every note and lyric, however
subtle, cannot be missed.

((B-Side Buzz
James McNamara
Herb David Guitar Studio staff member
What do you like about the Ypsilanti music scene?
(It has a) very healthy open-mic scene, which I think is vital for the
people that need it most.
What makes a good cover song?
I'm always open to hear how one artist is going to interpret or put
their spin on another person's song, especially when the two of
them are radically different.
Any upcoming events in Ann Arbor featuring tribute bands?
I know there's going to be a folk tribute to hip hop at the Blind Pig
called "Folk the Police." It's going to be all kinds of cover bands doing
folk trbutes to hip hop.
Excerpts are taken from the B-Side Buzz video,

A slice of rustic,
tavern comfort

A2 cover bands perform
for passion and payoff

ou would be hard-
pressed to find a dining
experience more casual
than that of Casey's Tavern. In
fact, I hesitate to even call it a
dining expe-
rience - it's
more of a pit
stop for a
hearty plate
of home-
town grub.
As a result,
people from NATHAN
all walks of WOOD
life pop in for
a bite: The
anesthesiologist who just got off
work, the young couple on their
way to a movie, the undergrad
taking a break from studying
and the family on the run all
gather here at dinnertime. These
folks flock for the food - the
crunchy, salty, greasy fare you
can only expect from such an
establishment. But this pub food
is definitely notches superior to
most.
Located on the corner of
Depot Street and 5th Avenue
across from the Amtrak sta-
tion, Casey's is unassuming in
every way. Before becoming the
great bar it is today, the shack
housed a lumber company, to
which Casey's owes much of its
coarse character. The major-
ity of the parking out back, for
instance, consists of single spots
f in a stable-like structure origi-
nally meant for a different use.
On a logistical note, parking is
extremely sparse, so you will
be at an advantage if you come
car-less.
Inside, the lights are dimmed,
but not to the point of intimida-
tion or harshness. Everything
looks worn but not quite weath-
ered, a difference that creates
a comfort factor. My coworkers
and I make our way over to a
booth by a tall, slender window.
The sill is a perfect place to stash
the extra set of napkins I'll soon
need and the incredible variety
of condiments offered tableside.
An autographed photograph of
Michael Phelps as he leaps from
his diving platform hangs next
to my head. Distracting? A little.
Awesome? Totally.
We order drinks from our sar-
castic waitress. She's terse, but in
a way that's backwardly inviting.
Bottles and glasses soon make
their way to the reused Casey's-
emblazoned coasters dashed
about our table.
"So, ya ready for some food?"
she challenges.
Yes ma'am, we are.
For an appetizer, the only
option is onion rings. Even if
you don't usually order appetiz-
ers, make these fried halos your
meal. They're truly heavenly.
To start, thick, fresh Spanish
onions are sliced by hand, yield-
ing big rings of punchy, onion-y
goodness. The rings then make
their way through a stiff batter
of wheat flour and cornmeal jolt-
ed with a bottle of Labatt Blue
and spiced simply with ground

black pepper. But it's when the
coated onions are dropped into
a deep fryer bubbling with light
soybean oil that the magic hap-
pens. The heat of the oil softens
the onion, both in texture and
flavor, and the batter begins to
wrap the rings with a delicate
coat of protective crunch. Luck-
ily, some batter does manage to
stray from the onion, connect-
ing the ring to a web intricately
woven by the fried liquid, which
begs to be broken off and enjoyed
separately from the rest of the
earthy appetizer. Dip these
babies in Casey's homemade-
daily ranch dressing. It's often
thin, but nevertheless cool,
refreshing and boldly flavored
with sharp garlic and bright dill.
The result: hot, cool, crunchy,
creamy, delicate, rustic - and
simply awesome.
The onion rings
are worth the
calories.
If you really must order a
meal, though, Casey's has you
covered there, too. I usually opt
for a burger with grilled onions,
bacon and pepper jack cheese.
The seven-ounce portion of
local Knight's Market ground
chuck is substantial, certainly
enough to split between two
smaller appetites. I have found
that the kitchen tends to under-
cook the burgers, however, so I
would advise going for at least
medium-well when ordering.
Give the patty a quick dousing
of Worcestershire sauce to beef
up the flavor and a dash of salt
for a savory bite. The steak fries
and pickle accompanying the
burger are not at all special,
however, souit's a good thing you
ordered those exquisite onion
rings.
If you happen to go on a day
when the eatery's offering up
its freshly baked coconut cream
pie, finish your meal off right
with a sweet slice. The crust is
solid, neither tough nor crumbly,
the thick filling is sweetened
nicely, the meringue is pillowy,
dissolving easily in the mouth,
and the shaved, toasted coconut
adorningthe golden peaks - the
"cherry on top" - completes the
treat.
Sweet tooth satisfied, you're
free to leave. But as you pull the
heavy door open to exit, peer
over your shoulder in a kind of
satisfied daze. Notice how the
floorboards are worn, the booths
cramped and the tables chipped.
Nothing seems quite right
about this corner joint, but in an
intriguing way. You smile know-
ing that's what makes everything
exactly right.
Wood is looking for another
stack of napkins. To share,

The Remix Band
and The Vintage
find art in live music
By MATT EASTON
Daily Film Editor
Tonight in Ann Arbor, Sina-
tra's voice may fill a local club
where swaying couples hold
each other arm-in-arm. In
Detroit, Led Zeppelin may be
belting out "Black Dog" for a
just-married bride and groom.
In a Grand Rapids coffee shop,
The Beatles maybe harmonizing
for sipping listeners. These icons
haven't played shows for more
than 30 years, but you can still
hear them live. Well, sort of.
This is the beauty of cover
bands, eclectic groups of friends,
families or even strangers tak-
ing a break from their day jobs
as engineers, furniture store
managers or kindergarten
teachers to become rockers and
soulful jammers by night. These
bands bring our favorite tunes
alive while straddling the line
between income and passion -
making money while making
music.
Two Ann Arbor-area cover
bands, The Remix Band and
The Vintage, have been play-
ing shows around Michigan for
about five years. The origins of
Remix are more akin to a fam-
ily than anything else. The four
senior members, Kirk Lawrence
(drums), Doug Haskins (vocals)

and husband-and-wife pair Ross
and Jana Doolittle (keyboards)
had been playing together for
about 10 years as Zero Gravity
before deciding to start Remix.
Kirk's wife, Karen Lawrence
(auxiliary percussion), joined in
2008. In 2010, they were joined
by one of Ross Doolittle's ex-
high-school-band-students, cur-
rent 'U' student Aaron Wallace
(guitar). The beginnings of The
Vintage are slightly less compli-
cated: Five years ago, Ron Tippin
moved from Georgia to Michi-
gan, found drummer Mark Wil-
son and bassist Rik Latta, and
began booking cover gigs.
The bands blur the line
between "original band" and
"cover band." At many events,
Remix intersperses cover songs
with originals from Zero Grav-
ity. The Vintage doesn't pepper
its performances with original
songs, but the group does have
an original band, Wide Track,
which features the same mem-
bers and has released two
albums and plays benefit con-
certs in the area.
"It's really hard when you
try to be an original band and a
cover band at the (same) time.
You're kind of working at cross
purposes," Tippin said.
The bands may have differ-
ent backgrounds and styles, but
their goals remain the same: to
provide the enjoyment of a live
show and supplement their day-
job incomes. Sitting in his home
in Dexter, Kirk Lawrence talked
about part of the motivation

behind Remix.
"We decided, 'Hey, let's do
this, let's start this thing up. See
if we can make a few bucks at it,
because we seem to have a lot of
fun with it.'"
A cover band is a business -
all the passion in the world won't
pay for gas and instruments.
Lawrence discussed how hard
it is to say no to gigs that can't
pay enough to cover Remix's
expenses. Remix goes where the
work is, and Lawrence described
how the band often used to per-
form in Saginaw, but is progres-
sively playing more and more
shows near the bigger cities in
southern Michigan, such as Ann
Arbor, Detroit and Lansing. The
reason is clear.
"The economy is certainly a
lot better here than it is north,"
Lawrence said. "We're hope-
ful we get a little bit more down
in this area ... (but) in this area
there is a lot more solid econo-
my."
Karen Lawrence noted why
Ann Arbor is so appealing for
cover bands: "There's a large
population of younger people
down here."
While a main provider for
shows is weddings, a large
clumping of college-age students
provides a notable opportunity
for these bands. And every band,
whether original or cover, heads
to where the opportunity exists.
For Remix, these gigs aren't
always perfect, but playing in
freezing weather or in clouds
of angry insects is a part of the

job, and they're doing what they
love.
It can be a tough career, but in
Ann Arbor and the surrounding
areas, such hardship can pro-
duce a type of artistic strength.
"It's very blue-collar around
here," said Tippin, who has
lived in Georgia, California
and Chicago. "People are used
to fighting for what they want,
fighting for carving their space
out in the world. I've seen some
amazing original music, and the
cover bands tend to have a more
original approach about them.
There's just a lot of artistic, and
massive (do-it-yourself) ethic in
these parts."
The goal is to be heard, to get
gigs and to provide a great live
show.
"There're a lot of bands, a lot
of musicians trying to do the
same thing," Tippin said.
Aside from money and the dif-
ficultyofgettingshows, the main
thing is the actual music and the
joy of the performance. Tippin
talked about the "immediate
energy" of a live show, which
can't be found anywhere but in
front of a band. For both groups,
the most important thing is giv-
ing the audience a stellar show,
and it's obvious that Remix and
The Vintage can't imagine not
going out and playing music.
"Anytime people are getting
into it, and ready to have a party,
to get down to music, it's going
to be a memorable night. We just

proposed by Amber Fellows, one
of the members of the band Swim-
suit, a local super-group of sorts.
The caf6 hosts performers, and
beginning in February, will imple-
ment a weekly showcase of song-
writers, artists and filmmakers,
called Ypsi Facto. Teachout is also
looking forward to selling more
records with some contributions
from the warehouses of Plym-
outh's record store Cousins Vinyl
starting in early March.
The caf6, open for over a year
now, has been successful. As
Teachout bags glass bottles of
Faygo, cider and caramels for a
string of customers, he chuckles.
"You know, I haven't been to
Ann Arbor in months, except for
maybe a few visits with friends,"
he said. "When you live in Ypsi-
lanti, you eventually just sort of
forget it's even there."

Duringa Saturday-eveningvisit
to Dreamland, the theater showed
a short feature film recorded
entirely with marionettes, accom-
panied by a live-action short and a
puppet show about a robotic baby
Jesus. Marionettes built with
twisted features and mixed media
covered the walls. One of the
performers shot a water gun into
the audience as he gave birth to a
tiny, puppet Judas, and then a cell
phone rang loudly.
"I'm at the show. Yeah. THE
PUPPET SHOW. I'M AT THE
PUPPET SHOW!" a man nearly
shouts over the performance
before sitting back down.
After the film, which featured
warped representations of Mar-
tha Stewart's prison experience,
a horrifyingly life-like Sarah
Palin marionette and a gooey
soundtrack of Elvis and Bee Gees
covers by Ypsilanti's Charlie Slick,
Sandon, smiling, addressed the
cell phone disturbance.
"I see it as a fun thing. You
get used to strange people doing
strange things," he said. "It adds
to the fun of the whole show. I like
when people taunt or do weird
things."
The theater, which recently cel-
ebrated its 10th anniversary, hosts
its share of unconventional per-
formances, films and musical acts.
It's a compact space that Sandon
sees as another one of Ypsilanti's

creative assets.
"Here, you can have a weird
idea and be able to do it," he said.
"That's all you can ask of a space.
To have the freedom to do what
you want to do. I get a weird idea
or some inspiration and I know
that this is a place that I can test
it out."
There andback again
For a prolific musician like Ypsi-
lanti-born Fred Thomas, it's that
same sort of freedom that's guided
more than 20 years of musical out-
put. With a crib sheet too intimi-
dating to abridge, Thomas' music
defies easy categorization. Part of
the trouble comes from the fact
that he seems to have collaborated
with just about everyone in South-
east Michigan.
Known especially for his stint
with the band Saturday Looks
Good To Me, and more recently,
Swimsuit, Thomas has toured
the country, lived in Portland and
New York, and founded a now-
defunct label called Ypsilanti
Records. These days, he works as
an editor for Allmusic.com, while
living in Ypsilanti, where he puts
out cassettes for a new record
label called Lifelike, and continues
to write and record music.
"Nobody is the audience," he
said. "Everyone who I know is a

CHRISTINA

generating songs that topped
charts and became the most
memorable tunes of a genera-
tion. Her voice and musical con-
tent had qualities exceeding the
maturity of an average 19-year-
old. Her demographic expand-
ed outside children and young
adults and her songs became
timeless to her younger fans as
they aged. Sorry, Britney, but
"E-mail My Heart" can only be
taken seriously for so long.
Unfortunately, calling Chris-
tina Aguilera one of the world's
greatest pop artists only holds
true when looking at her a decade
ago. Since then, she's added a
failed album, Bionic, and a singing
competition to her name, wast-
ing her immense talent. And her
song "Beautiful" holds a lot more
meaning now than it did in 2002.
It's better to just pretend she
retired after that year.
-GREGORY HICKS

S always thought I stopped lik-
ing Christina Aguilera because
she had become trashy. Seem-
ingly overnight, she reduced
her amount of clothing by a few
square feet, punched some extra
holes into her face and adopted
the skin color of a carrot. She
began going by Xtina and sang of
desires to sweat until her clothes
come off in songs like "Dirrty."
That was all it took for me to
lump Xtina in with Britney and
other tasteless pop stars and
completely forget about her.
But in returning to her '99
music videos, I realized I made
an error in judgment. Call her
Christina or Xtina, Aguilera has
always been a sexual figure in
the music industry. I wonder if
my parents ever thought it was
awkward when I'd blast "Genie
in a Bottle" from my boombox,
singing along to lyrics pertain-
ing to hormones and wanting to
be rubbed.
While songs like "What a Girl
Wants" and "Come On Over"

stayed in the puppy-love zone,
the dances that accompanied
them were sensual and under-
dressed. And then there's the
"Lady Marmalade" music video,
in which Christina pranced
around stage dressed quite liter-
ally as a whore.
I still stand by my original
reaction to Christina's image
when she acquired the Xtina
persona, and that reaction is, in a
word, ick. I'm not typically criti-
cal of appearance - I'm drawn
to artists with bizarre physical
images. I consider pop stars like
Katy Perry and Nikki Minaj to
be updated versions of Christina
in that they might get criticized
for being garish or vulgar, but
are praised by the masses despite
- and also because - of their
image.
But these modern singers
seem to have a more aesthetic
appeal than Christina. Yes, their
boobs are about to explode out
of their dresses, corsets and cat
suits, but there is something
artistic about that attire that was
lacking in Xtina's girl-next-door-

gone-stripper look.
However, I recently re-
watched Christina's music video
for "Beautiful" and instantly
hated myself for being such a
superficial bastard. I still think
she's wearing too much makeup
in the video, but after watching
it and listening to the damn song,
I've realized it doesn't matter
what I think of how Christina
looks. Where there is confidence,
there is beauty, so people like
myself can shut up and listen to
her sing already.
She's had an incredible voice
since her "Mickey Mouse Club"
days (YouTube it), and while her
image may have detracted from
my appreciation for the artist
- so much so that I never even
listened to post-2002 songs like
"Candyman" and "Ain't No Other
Man" - the fact remains that
Christina Aguilera has always
had an amazing voice.
Her sound is soulful, lucid and
full of passion, exceeding expec-
tations not only in the pop world
but in the entire music industry.
