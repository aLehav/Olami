DOWNTOWN RETAIL
CVS may
displace
Sava's cafe
Historic District
Commission must
approve plans
By LARA ZADE
ManagingNews Editor
The Village Apothecary may
no longer be the only pharmacy
in downtown Ann Arbor in the
near future.
A New York-based devel-
opment company planned last
month to demolish the 209-211
South State street building, which
includes Sava's State Street Cafe
andtwoothervacancies, and erect
a CVS/pharmacy in its place.
The building is located in
the State Street historic district,
which means any demolition
plans must first be approved by
the Ann Arbor Historic District
Commission before they are is-
sued to the Planning Commission
and City Council. The company
submitted its first plan to the
HDC in late April.
Jill Thatcher, the city's his-
toric preservation coordinator,
said that it's very unusual for
the HDC to approve a plan that
entails knocking down an entire
building.
"It's very rare for a demolition
request to be approved because
there are very specific circum-
stances the historic commission
is allowed to approve under state
and city law,"she said.
One example of such a con-
dition would be if the building

City to add more bike lanes

Improvements will
ensure downtown
cyclists' safety
By JASMINE ZHU
Daily News Editor
Ann Arbor is pedaling forward
with a plan to improve its bike lane
system by adding eight miles of
additional lanes and improving the
23.7 miles of existing lanes.
These improvements are part
of the city's goal of encouraging
residents to bicycle and walk more
frequently. Ann Arbor's efforts
over the past year have earned
it the title of a 2009 Spring Bicy-
cle Friendly Community by the
League of American Bicyclists.
Funding for the bicycle lane
improvements will come sole-
ly from federal stimulus funds,
capped at $250,000.
At a public meeting Thursday,
members of the City Transpor-
tation Planning Program sought
input from Ann Arbor residents on
proposed improvements along Ann
Street, Catherine Street, Ashley
Street and First Street. Also dis-
cussed was the plan to add eight
miles of bike lanes along Hill Street,
North University Avenue, East Uni-
versity Avenue, South University
Avenue and others.
After the preliminary plan is
approved by the Michigan Depart-
ment of Transportation, the project

will be set in motion.
Ann Arbor resident Lily Goz-
man said that though Ann Arbor
is, in general, a "bikeable" commu-
nity, she has experienced problems
when bicycling downtown.
"Downtown, I've been 'doored,"'
Gozman said, explaining that she
had been struck by an opening car
door while riding her bicycle.
Gozman added that she was
excited about the prospective
"sharrows," which are shared-use
pavement markings that alert bicy-
clists to the safest place to ride on

the road.
Gozman said that sharrows
would improve bicycle mobil-
ity and eliminate the issue of being
"doored."
Other changes in the downtown
area include "Walk Your Bike"
sidewalk signs that would instruct
bicyclists to walk their bicycles on
sidewalks to protect pedestrians, as
well as "Share the Road" signs for
motorists and bicyclists.
Eli Cooper, City Transportation
Planning Program manager, said
the reason behind the bicycle lane

improvement plan is to clearly dif-
ferentiate bicycle lanes from car
lanes.
"Some of the problems that we
have are that (the roads) are not well
signed, and they're not well marked
using proper pavement markings
and signage," Cooper said. "What
happens then is some motorists
don't realize it's a bicycle lane, and
we believe that by creating a clear
indication by using proper marking
and signage, what's for the motor-
ists will be used by the motorists,
and what's for the bicyclists will be
used by the bicyclists."
Based on the new design for
the existing lanes, where they
begin will be marked with an
arrow pavement mark and bicy-
cle symbol. "Bike Lane Ahead"
signs will notify motorists that
bicyclists should be expected in
the roadway.
Signs spaced no further than
a quarter-mile apart will notify
motorists of continuing bicycle
lanes. The end of the lanes will
be tapered in order to warn bicy-
clists.
According to Pat Cawley, City
Transportation Planning Pro-
gram senior project manager, the
plan for improvingbike lanes still
isn't finalized.
"What we're going to submit
to the Michigan Department of
Transportation in the next few
weeks is a preliminary plan," he
said.
Cawley said there are no plans
to startphysically workingon the
project until spring 2010.

Gupta's words of wisdom

'U' alum and CNN
reporter talks life
lessons, role models
By LARA ZADE
Managing News Editor
Editor's. Note: In a sit-down
interview with The Michigan Daily,
CNN personality Sanjay Gupta
discusses his life as a Michigan
student and his decision to turn
down the surgeon general posi-
tion. Gupta was the speaker at the
Medical School's commencement
ceremony.
Zade: What is your fondest
memory from your time at the
University as a student?
Gupta: There (are) so many
memories here. I was here for
such a long time. It's probably a
good thing that it's hard to distill
it down to just one. But I think
being at the football games was
probably the thing that I remem-
ber the most because you look
around and you're immersed
with all of these people who are
just like you. They're students
- they're curious, they want to
be part of the larger world and
there's a very festive atmosphere,
usually, if it was a good season.
I think that, and all of the sur-
rounding parties around those
games and the spirit of this place
is something that I found is hard
to find once you leave here.
Z: What skills did you acquire
at the University that helped you
be successful in life?
G: I think I really started to
develop my writing skills here at
Michigan, in part -because people
let me write. There wasn't a con-
formist attitude or an idea that
you had to walk in with a certain
skill set to be able to really con-
tribute in some way.
I think when I started writing
I wasn't particularly good at it but
that didn't seem to be a problem.
I think people really helped me
with that. And I think that writ-
ing, for me, has probably driven
every other part of my life, includ-
ing medicine. A lot of what we do
in medicine is contributing to the
larger knowledge of our field, so I
began to write scientific papers, I
worked at the White House. I went
there and was writing speeches for
the.President and the First Lady -
again, a lot of those skills having
first started to germinate here at
Michigan.

And now I'm a journalist, a
reporter, in addition to being a
doctor, and I take great pride
in the fact that I write my own
pieces and a lot of copy for all of
our various mediums. So, I think
the writing in some ways was the
most surprising.
I got a world class education
here, and I became a fully trained
neurosurgeon here, but it was the
writing that I think propelled me
in directions that I would have
never imagined.
Z: Did you have any role models
as a student at the University?
G: (...) The person who I think
had the most overall profound
impact on my life here at Michi-
gan was Dr. Julian Hoff, who was
a chairman of neurosurgery at
that point. He was one of those
guys who I think in many ways
emulated the Michigan tradi-
tion of "we're going to teach you
everything you need, you're going
to walk out of here as educated
and trained as anywhere else in
the world, we're also going to
open your mind in ways that you
can't even imagine."
I think you come to college
with some preconceived notions
of what you want to do and who
you want to be when you grow up,
but when you just sort of let your
mind be open to various things
and ideas it's really an awesome
thing and I think people are bet-
ter because of it.
Z: Can you discuss the process
of how the position of the Surgeon
General was offered to you, and
what factors made you decide not
to take it?
G: The way that was offered to
me was I got a call from the Presi-
dent and he says, "Let's talk about
you being Surgeon General." That
was back in November, he had
just been elected and he was in
Chicago, so I flew to Chicago and
we sat down and talked about
everything related to health and
health care in this country, and it
was a great conversation to have.
It was a real interesting insight
into what the man who is going to
be in charge of not only that but
of the whole free world, (what) his
focus was when it came to health
care specifically.
I was extremely flattered by
it and it was a really tough deci-
sion not to do it, but in the end for
me it really came down to some-
thing personal. I didn't want to
be a commuting dad. My wife was
pregnant at the time, that child is

now six weeks old. I wanted (to)
be around for those things and I
didn't want to only see my kids for
a day or day and a half a week for
several years. That was probably
the biggest thing.
I also found out, which I didn't
know, because you learn things as
you go through the process, that
I wouldn't be able to continue to
practice surgery. And I'm still a
relatively young surgeon, not as
young as a lot, but you know I still
have many years of surgery that

I'd like to be able to practice, and
I think when you walk away from
a field like neurosurgery, for four
years or eight years, depending
on how long he's president, you're
essentially saying bye to it, I don't
think I would have been able to go
back to it.
Most of the people who have
been Surgeon General in the past
have taken the job closer to retire-
ment, at a different phase in their
life, and I think that those were
really my primary reasons.

Obama's poor policies

Emploving federal funds
Senate must pass bills to extend unemployment benefits
As Michigan's economy continues to crumble under the strain of
a failing auto industry, more and more Michigan residents find
themselves without employment. And as Michigan's economy
shifts away from a manufacturing base, these workers need extensive
training to find new jobs. To remedy the problem, the state House of Rep-
resentatives recently passed two bills that extend benefits to unemployed
workers participating in long-term training. Sweetening the deal, the
cash to pay for extended benefits isn't coming out of the pockets of the
state's taxpayers, but from the federal government's stimulus funds. Con-
sidering the positive effects the bills will have, the Senate should ensure
that they make it to the governor's office and become law.

A few more than 100 days
have come and gone since Barack
Obama, our 44th president, took
office. Since then, he has been
busy attempting to fix the many
issues that plague our nation=
domestically and abroad. While
Obama has good intentions and is
extremely popular, the decisions
he has made since his inaugura-
tion are causing the country more
harm than good. For examples of
this, look no further than out of
control spending that has inflated
the national debt and the foreign
policy blunders that are weaken-
ing this country's defenses.
Since entering office, Obama
has passed two budgets and a
stimulus bill. The federal debt is
currently more than $11 trillion
and the recently passed budgets
will only increase this figure. In
order to operate with such high
costs, taxes must be increased -
taxes that more and more Ameri-
cans are unable to pay.
Obama's solution to this prob-
lem has been to promise a tax cut
for 95 percent of Americans. This
means that the tax money must
come from only 5 percent of the
population. While the rich should
definitely paya fair share, or even
a proportional share, they should
not have to support the entire
nation. The government should
not punish those who have been
successful and the strain on this
one segment of our society is
unethical. Our government owes
all its citizens, even the wealthy,
a sense of equality.
Further spending came in the
form of the controversial $787
billion stimulus plan. Much of
this money was spent bailing out
financial institutions and other
programs Obama felt needed to
be funded. The $454 million in
bonuses that were given to AIG
executives after being bailed
out were a good example of the
many problems that result from
the government redistributing
wealth amongst private institu-
tions. The bonuses were given
out at the taxpayers' expense, and
Obama himself took responsibil-
ity for the lack of oversight.

This handling of the taxpay-
ers' money is disturbing. If the
government is going to play fast
and loose with our money, Obama
should have made sure there were
checks in the bailout to prevent
money from going to the execu-
tives.
In addition to his irrespon-
sible taxation, Obama has made
many foreign policy missteps.
He visited Europe to apologize
for what the U.S. has done in the
past. When our president - the
man who represents our nation to
the world - goes to other coun-
tries and apologizes, somethingis
wrong. First of all, the question of
whether or not America has any-
thing to apologize for is certainly
a debate to be had. Secondly, the
U.S. has always been a proud
country, and our leaders have
always defended it in word and
deed. Our new, supposedly more
worldly president has taken it
upon himself to apologize for the
actions of the previous adminis-
tration.
Those who would seek to harm
our nation see these apologies as
a sign of weakness. If they believe
Obama is too fearful of how the
world will react to his actions,
these people will attack us. Obama
has decided to overlook concerns
of national security in favor of
international acceptance.
Obama seems to be more con-
cerned with appeasing our so-
called allies in Spain, Germany
and France than with the nation's
security and defense. Our world
image is important - but not at the
expense of our dignity or security.
Overall, the first 100 days of a
presidency (aside from President
Franklin Roosevelt's) are rarely
indicative of the entire term.
Obama has shown that he's will-
ing to make some radical-- and
hurtful - changes in our nation's
policy right off the bat. And
though only 100 days of his presi-
dency have gone by, the problems
he has already caused will stay
with us far into the future.

The current unemployment
program in Michigan requires
recipients be actively seeking
full-time employment to receive
unemployment benefits. On
Wednesday, the House passed
two amendments to the Michigan
Employment Security Act that, if
signedintolaw,will make26addi-
tional weeks of benefits available
to unemployed workers in state-
approved training programs- and
those looking for part-time jobs.
The money to fund the extension
would come from $138.9 million
in federal stimulus funding that
the state would qualify for if it
passes the bills.
Republicans havejustified their
opposition to the bills by arguing
that after the federal money runs
out, the state will have no choice
but to raise unemployment insur-
ance taxes on businesses. The
House's Fiscal Agency estimates
that costs to businesses would be
$69.7 million annually. Republi-
cans claim that when small busi-

nesses are forced to cut costs to
pay the taxes, they will elimi-
nate jobs and unemployment will
increase.
These are valid concerns -
hurting small businesses won't
heal the economy. But oppo-
nents of the bills fail to account
for their benefits. Workers.
currently unemployed and on
approved job training programs
are eligible for unemployment
benefits for up to 59 weeks. But
some of these workers need
more time to learn new skills
and find a job in an in-demand
field. Supporting workers while
they train will ensure that they
have the resources to adapt to
Michigan's evolving economy.
Educating the workforce will
also fill technical and scientific
positions that encourage eco-
nomic recovery.
Opponents of the bills also
forget that the costs of the
extension will be paid for by
federal stimulus funding spe-

cifically marked for these exten-
sions. Considering Michigan's
current economic crisis, creat-
ing laws to help the unemployed
is a worthwhile effort, especial-
ly with more than $100 million
in federal cash to foot the bill.
And giving workers more time
to complete vocational train-
ing and re-enter the workforce
increases the chance that there
won't be as high a demand for
unemployment benefits as the
federal money runs out.
. According to the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics, Michigan has
the highest unemployment rate
in the country at a depressing
12.6 percent. These bills would
not only provide short-term relief
to workers, but also the necessary
means - by way of training for
high-demand occupations - to
resuscitate the state's economy.
The Senate needs to recognize
that these bills help Michigan's
workers and - best of all - do so
at no immediate cost to the state.

Policing the police

BELLA SHAH
E-MAIL BELLA AT BELLZ@UMICH.EDU

Living in Ann Arbor, rallies
and protests aren'tanything
new to me. But a few weeks
ago I became
curious when I ,
ran across my
friends' photos
of a rally at Pur-
chase College,
located about
a half hour
north of Man-
hattan. EarlierE
that week, Pur- ED
chase held its MCPHEE
annual spring
festival "Cul-
ture Shock," featuring an evening
concert performed by the fairly
well-known ska band, Streetlight
Manifesto. As with many other
ska concerts, a mosh pit quickly
formed and just as quickly grew
out of control. The show even had
to be stopped a few times to ask
the audience to move back from
the stage - and from the cops that
guarded it as well.
Naturally, one student was
pushed too hard out of the mosh
pit and into one of the cops. The
student, Hart Seely, fell backward,
and his hand hit the policeman's
hat. When other students asked
what had happened to Seely after
the show, the police responded
that he had been removed from the
scene for hitting a policeman.
Any sensible person would
realize that this collision was
accidental. And maybe so did the
cop. But something got under his
skin, because he didn't react as
any sensible person would. When
Seely asked why he had been taken
from the scene, the cop responded
with "You know what you did" -
a generic one-liner straight out of
a Bruce Willis movie, rather than
a precise description of formal
charges. It wasn't until 11 a.m.
the next day after a night spent in
transport between three law-en-
forcement facilities that the police
informed Seely of the charges
being filed against him.
At this point, it could only be
assumed that he was beingheld for
assaulting a police officer. What
else could he be charged with? But
by the next morning, attempting
to steal an officer's firearm was
added to the assault charge.
Since his release from jail, See-
ly's life is in shambles - and he
hasn't even stood trial yet. At a
hearing by Purchase College, he
was suspended from the school,
banned from the residence area
and isn't even allowed in his room.
He's been allowed to finish classes
this semester, but his return to the

college afterthatisupinthe air. It's
as if he's already been found guilty
before his trial has even started.
How could he have imagined on
the night of the concert that by the
next morning he would be a crimi-
nal for falling into a cop? Now he's
worrying about his ability to finish
his education and escape the situ-
ation without a conviction for the
ridiculous charges.
Hart's story isn't the first one
about a cop taking advantage of a
citizen. From the 1991 police beat-
ings of Rodney King to Seely's mis-
treatmentinApril2009, policemen
breakingthe lawsthey'resupposed
to uphold is nothing new. But the
practice of cops ignoring citizens'
rights should be the exception, not
the rule. It's as though the police
have forgotten they're supposed to
keep people safe, not cause more
trouble. How can we ever trust the
police when they continue to take
advantage of harmless citizens?
So much for the
call to "protect
and serve" us.
There has to be a check on
the police. Dirty cops seem to be
everywhere, and it's difficult to
tell the good from the bad. Our
legal system frequently doesn't
help the situation, either, as a cop's
word carries more weight in court
than that of a normal citizen. A
cop usually has to get caught in
the act to be charged with a crime
- and that's easier said than done.
In the end, there's no one to police
the police, and as we continue to
see abuse of their authority, a way
to check cops seems all the more
essential.
It's sad that those assigned to
"protect and serve" aren't held to
the same - if not better - stan-
dards of the law than the rest of
society. The police should be held
accountable, so that everyone still
trusts the force as they ought to.
If cops were held accountable,
Hart wouldn't be headed to crimi-
nal trial. His future has been put
in jeopardy by a cop abusing the
system - a cop seemingly disin-
terested in protecting the masses.
If those meant to protect consis-
tently fail at their job, how safe can
we feel?

No more than five minutes
after the marching band
arrived in Columbus for
the Ohio State
football game,
we had already
been flipped
off by about
30 Ohio State
fans, many of
whom were
not students. -
Let me JEREMY
repeat that.
Ohio State LEVY
fans, some well
into their thir-
ties and forties, were giving the
finger to members of the Michi-
gan Marching Band, who ranged
from 18 to 22 years old. Really?
I don't mind being ridiculed by
Ohio State students, but any full-
grown adult who still flips the
bird at a college marching band
needs to get a life.
The problem, of course, was
that these overzealous Ohio State
fans were caught up in the intense
rivalry between the University of
Michigan and Ohio State.
Rivalries and intense compe-
tition in sports are an integral
part of nearly every culture.
Whether you are talking about
enmity between Michigan and
Ohio State, the Red Sox and
the Yankees or even the soccer
teams from Argentina and Brazil,
rivalries are unavoidable in the
sporting world. Of course, these
rivalries can be fun. I enjoyed
lying on my couch with a bag of
chips and a tub of guacamole to
watch the championship round
of the NCAA Basketball Tour-
nament. I would also love to see
our football team demolish Ohio
State next year.
But it's a stretch to assume, as
many people do, that rivalries are
inherently good. As spectators,
overly intense rivalries in sports
shape our views of competition
and can indirectly affect the way
we perceive higher education and
politics.

Let me start with the afore-
mentioned Ohio State fans who
were so entrenched in college
rivalry that they never grew out
of mocking Michigan students. I
hope that by the time I reach my
forties I will have moved on to
better things.
But Ohio State fans are not the
only people who treasure foot-
ball rivalries as one of the most
important aspects of attending
college. As I'm sure you know,
their view is fairly common. Two
of my high school teachers, both
alumni from the University of
Illinois, booed when I told them
I was going to college at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. I know they
were joking and whatnot. But it's
a problem that even among pro-
fessional educators - who are
supposed to encourage higher
education - any mention of a Big
Ten school conjures up notions of
sports rivalries.
Maybe you don't mind that our
society often values sports more
than education. But sports also
seem to reinforce the competive-
ness of politics - and I doubt that
anyone thinks politics should
become more competitive.
After Barack Obama was elect-
ed president last November, the
celebration in Ann Arbor bore a
strange resemblance to a sports
rally. People with cowbells led
the same "Go Blue" chant that is
typically heard in the Big House
and at some points the crowd
often burst into choruses of "The
Victors." Sports and politics are
competitive, but potential voters
should not view both from the
same perspective.
Contrary to Meg Young's
column about March Madness
(An amateur at the Big Dance,
03/23/2009), I am less con-
vinced that competition in sports
encourages meaningful pas-
sion. Young argued that sports
fields were often the place where
important social battles could be
fought. She used events such as
Jessie Owens' victory in the 1936

Berlin Olympics or Jackie Robin-
son's entrance into Major League
Baseball to indicate the uplifting
quality of sports.
But these events were monu-
mental because they were reflec-
tive of the political and social
environment in which they
occurred. Jessie Owens's gold
medal symbolized ideological
differences that already existed
between the United States and
Germany, and Jackie Robinson's
breaking of the color barrier was
one event in a pre-existing move-
ment against segregation. These
events certainly deserve praise,
but they do not prove that rivalry
in sports is intrinsically valuable.
I hope I won't be
flipping off Ohio
State fans at 40.
When I tell people about my
spite forunnecessarysportsrival-
ries, they usually tell me to go
complain in Europe, where soccer
matches often cause riots. While
Americans' sense of rivalry cer-
tainly pales in comparison, it isn't
any more justified. I understand
that rivalry can make sports more
fun, but in many instances it goes
to far. For example, it worries me
that my roommate wants to burn
an Ohio State effigy in front of
our apartment next year.
Sports are intended to be
entertaining, but they can also
influence our societal mindset.
If we recognize this, we can stop
sports from shaping our view of
more socially relevant institu-
tions like education and politics.
In the end, these are the institu-
tions that have a more import-
nant impact on our lives.

GM
From page 1
February and represents the latest
collaboration between the Uni-
versity and GM.
Through ABCD, which is sup-
ported by the United States De-
partment of Energy and the state
of Michigan, about 50 GM re-
searchers and 80 University grad-
uate students have been working
to extend battery life and solve
performance issues.
Dennis Assanis, co-director
of Engine Systems Research at the
GM/UM Collaborative Research
Laboratory and an Engineering
professor, said that after work-
ing with GM for nearly ten years,
the institute "is like a dream come
true."
Assanis and a group of gradu-
ate students have been studying
homogenous charged compres-
sion ignition, which results in low
exhaust emissions and improved
fuel efficiency and can be applied
in plug-in hybrid and electric ve-
hicles.
"We truly feel that combined
with other technologies the HCCI
can give us a 15-percent improve-
ment in fuel economy over today's
(standard) engine," Assanis said.
CVs

was a health hazard to the public.
She said the company pulled
its original plans earlier last week,
instead proposing a new plan that
would keep the existing front fa-
gade of the original building but
knock out the rest of what's behind
it. As of last Thursday, the company
had not resubmitted the plan.
Thacher added that the HDC
would be more likely to pass the
revised plan because it would keep
the front fagade and restore the
building's original windows. A sim-
ilar plan was passed by the HDC
back in 2007, but the construction
company never followed through
with the plan.
Although the development
plan would force owner SavaLelcaj
to move her restaurant elsewhere,
she said it was good timing.
Lelcaj, who opened her cafe in
June 2007, said she's recently been
looking for a new place to relocate
because her business has gotten
too big for 211 State Street.
"I'm looking at a couple differ-
ent locations right now," she said.
"I definitely want to try and stay on
State Street."
Lelcaj named Earl of Sand-
wich's former location as one that

Mark Hoffman, an Engineer-
ing graduate student, has worked
with Assanis the past five years
researching HCCI and the for-
mation of combustion chamber
deposits.
Hoffman said it's an exciting
time for Engineers in the market
because the government is push-
ing Engineers to develop higher
fuel efficiency.
"We now have an opportunity
where everyone is coming and
asking 'What can you give us?"'
he said.
With the state of the economy,
Hoffman added that for engineers,
"to be in demand is a big plus."
Hoffman said if GM offered
him a job after graduation, he
wouldn't turn it down.
Currently, GM employs more
than 2,000 University graduates
and has funded about100 research
projects over the past nine years.
While the University has
collaborated with GM for more
than 50 years on various projects,
Munson said he expects great au-
tomotive innovations will spawn
from the new institute.
"We look forward to the
breakthroughs we expect to
achieve in the academic and com-
mercial successes that will result,"
he said.
she's interested in.
Lelcaj also said that she
thought a CVS in her current loca-
tion would bring more to the com-
munity than just medication and
toiletries.
"I really think we're in need of
a CVS," she said. "I think it would
bring the Main Street locals on to
State Street and blend our city."
Michael Kaplan, a 2009 gradu-
ate from the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts, said thatcafter
attending the University for four
years, he thinks there is a big de-
mand for a second pharmacy near
campus.
"While the Village Apothecary
is nice, I feel like you need more
competition," he said. "It would
make the prices go down. You need
another option."
Ahmad Faik, also a 2009 LSA
graduate, agreed that there should
be another pharmacy downtown
but that it should be a small busi-
ness, not a corporate pharmacy.
"I think it should be a family-
owned pharmacy, he said. "I feel
like the CVS would take away from
other businesses around here."
The next deadline for the com-
pany to submit its plan to the HDC
is May 18 and it would be reviewed
by the committee on June 8. The
public hearing on the proposal
would be on June11.

'College Life'
keeps it real

MTV's latest
reality show
focuses on
student drama
By BRIGID KILCOIN

"It's not 'reality:' it's
real." As
the show's *
bafflingly
inane Li
tagline
might Mondays at

MTV's MTV
series
"College
Life" veers closer to prob-
able occurrence than the

channel's other carefully
choreographed attempts at
slice-of-life programming.
The producers of "College
Life" give handheld cameras
to six University of Wiscon-
sin students and have them
personally film their foibles
and failings throughout the
first year of college. Much
like the cast of "Real World,"
the show's core characters
seem handpicked to embody
every college archetype
(Innocent Christian, Girl
from a Small Town, Over-
achiever, Bro, Rebel and
Kid Desperately-Clinging-
to-His-High-School-Girl-
friend, in case you were
wondering). But unlike
"Real World," the kids are
more intriguing than they
appear at first glance, and

their problems are fairly
representative of the actual
college experience.
Slacker Kevin struggles
to balance constant party-
ing with his parents' disap-
proval of his failing math
grade. Studious Lindsay
deals with the constant
presence of her roommate's
boyfriend in their dorm
room. Artsy Jordan tries to
figure out a way to hide his
new tattoo when he returns
home to visit his parents.
While significantly less
dramatic than the majority
of reality TV, these portray-
als of everyday minutiae
make the show hit closer to
home.
Unfortunately, the show's
editing detracts from its

Sunday.
Since 2004, the festival has aimed to pro-
mote reading, writing and literary apprecia-
tion through author presentations, exhibits
and panel discussions. Booths will be set
up in the Michigan League - as well as out-
side in Ingalls Mall - exhibiting 57 authors,
bookstores and publishers. Presentations
in the League will cover topics such as the
newspaper industry, youth and creativity,
how books change lives and the future of the
book.
The Ann Arbor art
scene thrives
all summer long.
"The organizers who were originally
behind the idea were various people in the
community," said Kathy Robenalt, a Uni-
versity alum and executive director of the
festival.
"Some were University people, book-
store people, library people and a mix of
writers who all felt that the community
can support something like this," Robenalt
added.
Over the past few years, the
festival has brought together over
850 authors and performers and
over 8,000 students. This year
promises to be a continuing suc-
cess. For the third year in a row,
a writing conference will be held M
for those interested in sharpening
their writing skills and interact-
ing with visiting authors. The list
of appearing authors includes Col-
son Whitehead ("Sag Harbor"),
Deanna Adams ("Confession of a
Not-So-Good Catholic Girl") and
Heather Buchanan ("Kiss & Tell").
Guest authors will also be at a
reception at the Ann Arbor Dis-
trict Library following the confer-
ence and at the Author Breakfast i
on Saturday in the League. W-4
The festival is committed to A I

promoting literariness not only through
the written word but also through theater,
dance and music. On Friday, an event called
"The Art of the Play: From Page to Stage"
will feature short performances by Ann
Arbor's Blackbird Theatre and The Per-
formance Network. These performances
will be part of the evening's examination
of play production, which will also include
a panel discussion featuring William Bol-
com, a Grammy Award winner and former
professor in the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance, and OyamO (Charles F. Gordon),
a renowned playwright and an associate
professor of English and Theatre.
On Saturday, Peter Yarrow of the folk
group Peter, Paul and Mary, who is com-
monly remembered for co-writing "Puff
the Magic Dragon," will perform folk
songs from his children's books.
Returning this year is the Ann Arbor
Civic Ballet, which will perform on Sun-
day with original choreography set to the
children's picture book "Llama Llama
Misses Mama," by Anna Dewdney. The
author will narrate her story as the danc-
ers perform.
The festival is accessible to all age groups
and supports the reading and writing scene
not only at the University, but also through-
out Ann Arbor - a town composed of
accomplished and developing writers alike.
"Ann Arbor is a culture
ofideaswherepeoplewant
to come and hear what
others have to say about
different issues, and then
interact with those people
and have Q&A and share
their thoughts," Kobenalt
said. "It's a hotbed of liter-
ary activity."

COLLEGE LIFE
From Page 8
compelling subject matter.
The decision to add and drop
main characters from epi-
sode to episode makes the
show difficult to follow. The
interweaving of the charac-
ters' storylines is choppy and
often confusing; the struggle
of forming a coherent epi-
sode from the footage taken
from the lives of six students
who essentially don't inter-
act with each other means
that the same plot points are
constantly reemphasized.
Another issue is the show's
lack of continuity - the epi-
sodes jump back and forth
between months with no
logical progression through-
out the year.

While this is irritating,
"College Life" is spot-on in
its depiction of realistic rela-
tionships. For instance, the
show's agonizingportrayal of
the on-again, off-again rela-
tionship between Andrea,
an overzealous Christian,
and Josh, her desperate ex-
boyfriend, is just as annoying
and drawn-out as it probably
is in real life.
The show's lackluster pro-
duction values are certainly
another weakness. The nau-
sea-inducing use of shaky
handheld cameras, while
more personal than a typical
multi-camera reality show,
ultimately detracts from the
show's overall quality. The
washed-out, grainy student
footage is strongly reminis-
cent of a YouTube video. The
kids tend to shoot either tight
close-ups of their faces or the

faces of the people they are
talking to, giving the show
an almost claustrophobic
vibe and the viewer no sense
of where each scene takes
place. Multiple tertiary char-
acters refuse to be shown on
camera or to allow their con-
versations to be taped, creat-
ing a strange hybridization of
scripted television and actual
reality.
"College Life," while not
groundbreaking, is a light-
weight and -entertaining
piece of programming that
the majority of college stu-
dents can identify with. In
this case, MTV's decision
to focus on the channel's
primary demographic of
everyday students rather
than wealthy southern Cal-
ifornians or (yet another)
"Real World/Road Rules"
crossover is a shrewd one.

Seniors Teddi Ewing and Megan Gregory lift the Big Ten trophy at Alumni Field Friday.
The Wolverines won 21 oftthe last 22 games to finish their Big Ten title season.
By Michael Florek ( Daily Sports Writer
EAST LA NSING-As Seniors'Teddi Ewing and Megan
Gregory stood by home plate of Alumni Field for their
final regular season game Friday, they were handed a
new addition to the Michigan softball family.
A Big Ten title - the 13th in program history.
As they lifted the trophy to a huddle of teammates, the 1,832 fans at
Alumni Field erupted into rousing applause. The Wolverines had given
coach Carol Hutchins her first title since their National Championship run
in the 2005 season.
After Friday's 8-2 victory, their final regular seasongame ended in a 2-1
loss to Michigan State, but the game meant little for the overall standings.
The eighth-ranked Wolverines had already won the conference title.
"It goes to show you how hard we've worked," junior Angela Findlay said.
"We made a commitment as a teamto focus on playing one-pitch softball."
After sharingthe regular season title with Northwestern last year, this
was Michigan's first outright Big Ten title since 2005.
"It is a big difference (to win outright)," Findlay said. "Last year we
didn't really get to celebrate or anything. ... We got our stuff a couple
weeks later - it definitely wasn't as exciting."
Despite the score, clinchingthe championship wasn't easy. Findlay gave

the Wolverines an early 2-0 lead after
the first inning, but Michigan was
shut out through the middle innings,
and Michigan State tied the game on
a two-run home run.

Joseph switched pitchers in the fifth,
sophomore Dorian Shaw's single
scored two runs and the rout was on.

in both the MICHIGAN 8
fifth and
the sixth innings.
The near-perfect nature of Michi-
gan's Big Ten run made the feat
all the more impressive. After los-
ing their opening Big Ten series to
Northwestern, Michigan rattled off
21 straight wins before Saturday's
loss.
"I thought that was the best thing
that happened to us," Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins said. "It real-
ly forced us back into our moment,
because they didn't get caught up in
the race for a while. Then we really
started gelling, and we had some

people catch fire."
Michigan's pitching has been its
strength all year, and, despite the
streak-ending loss, it was strong this
weekend as well. Junior Nikki Nem-
itz and sophomore Jordan Taylor had
just one problem - the home run.
Both gave up two-run home runs
early in their starts last weekend
while racking up 11 strikeouts.
Michigan has been battling back
from early deficits all season. After
giving up early runs, both pitchers
came back to throw well all season,
giving their hitters a chance to win.
Seven of their 17 Big Ten wins were
in come-from-behind fashion.
"I was concerned that this week-
end would be a little anti-climatic in
some regards," Hutchins said. "But I
thought our kids just gutted through
it. It wasn't one of our best games, yet
we're the

The con-
ference championship also guaran-
tees that Michigan is in the field for
its 15th straight season. Their quest
for a second NCAA Championship in
five years will start at Alumni Field
May 15 against Miami (Ohio) in the
NCAA Regionals.

Steven Moneke finally sealed
the victory at No. 2 singles as he
defeated senior Andrew Mazlin.
"It was a pretty long season
with some ups and downs,"junior
George Navas said. "There's
kind of mixed emotions - I'm
proud of the way we bounced
back from the huge slump to
make the (NCAA) Tournament
and give Ohio State a competi-
tive match two times in a row.
... But we didn't do enough work
during the body of the season to
earn the opportunity to play a

Next year, the team returns
the bulk of its starting singles
and doubles lineup. And with the
incoming tandem of high school
standouts Chris Cha and Evan
King, the top-rated recruit in the
country, the Wolverines could
have an opportunity to contend
for a Big Ten Championship and
to go deeper in the NCAA Tour-
nament.

The win gave Michigan a pro-

The Wolverines used eight
straight goals to beat the Lions
on Sunday and were led by senior
captain Julie Hyrne's hat trick.
