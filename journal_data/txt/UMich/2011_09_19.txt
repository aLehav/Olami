IDs from
abroad face
increased
scrutiny

Shoppers peruse posters inside the newly opened Bongz and Thongz shop on East Liberty Street on Saturday. The store, which opened Sept. 10, is not allowed to
sell the $12,000 worth of merchandise, including sex toys, that the store's owners already purchased but will now sell online instead.

students refused at
some local bars for
unfamiliar IDs
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily StaffReporter
When Business School senior
Weilong Song arrived at Buffalo
Wild Wings on State Street on
his 21st birthday two years ago,
he planned to have a celebratory
drink with a group of friends.
After ordering his drink,
however, his Hungarian ID was
taken by the manager for further
examination.
"I showed him my ID, and he
said he wanted to take a better
look at it, so he took it," Songsaid.
"And then he came back, and he
told me that unfortunately they
cannot accept the ID because
he cannot read what it says and
he cannot verify that this ID is
legitimate."
Song said his friends tried to

convince the manager the ID
was government issued, and
even pulled up a Google image
of a Hungarian ID for the man-
ager to compare to the card Song
presented. Upon comparison, the
manager finally accepted Song's
ID and served him the drink.
"He took my ID and kind of
compared the two and he said,
'Alright whatever,' and he kind
of gave me a very weird look,"
Song said. "I didn't feel very well
(treated), considering it was my
21st birthday, and we were with
a big group of people."
For Song and many interna-
tional students lacking United
States identification, this expe-
rience of additional ID exami-
nation isn't uncommon when
entering bars and ordering
drinks at restaurants.

Madeka wrote in an e-mail inter-

City ordinance
bans 'devices
designed for sexual
stimulation'
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
Though Ann Arbor may be
known as a liberal city, a new
retailerhas found that its inven-
tory isn't receiving as warm a

welcome as it anticipated.
Kilo Hassan and Steve Abou-
na, owners of the store Bongz
and Thongz on East Liberty
Street, are facing difficulties
because of a city ordinance
that outlaws the mass sale of
sex toys in the downtown area.
Hassan and Abouna planned to
sell water pipes and sex toys at
their new store, which officially
opened for business on Sept. 10.
Hassan said he was unaware
of the regulation while plan-
ning his business, which was

supposed to open in July,
according to an Aug. 1 Ann
Arbor.com article. The over-
sight has resulted in Bongz and
Thongz having approximately
$12,000 worth of unsellable
inventory.
Hassan said he and Abouna
discovered the problem when
they applied for an occupancy
license. They were required to
provide the city with an invoice
of purchases for the store and
were consequently told that
their inventory could not be

sold in the downtown area.
"The reason we didn't
research this stuff is there are
other stores in the area that sell
basically the same thing," Has-
san said. "It was bad judgment
on our part, but I guess we can
fix that."
Under the ordinance, the
sale of "devices designed for
sexual stimulation" cannot
account for more than 20 per-
cent of a business's total sales.
Because of this stipulation,

While many University pro-

growing number are embracing
the technology to enhance learn-

Through the program Lee-

The University released a new

Grizzly bear kilk

Man dead after
attack in remote
area of Montana
BONNERS FERRY, Idaho
(AP) - A grizzly bear wounded
by a hunter later attacked and
killed the hunter's partner Friday
after the two men tracked the
animal in a remote area along the
Idaho-Montana boarder, author-
ities said.
Steve Stevenson, 39, and Ty
Bell, 21, members of a hunting
party from Winnemucca, Nev.,
were going after black bears
when the attacked occurred
about 10 a.m. PDT in a mountain-
ous, heavily forested region in

Lincoln County, Mont., near the
Canadian border.
Bell shot and wounded a young
male grizzly, believing it to be a
black bear, undersheriff Brent
Faulkner said.
"They tracked the bear into an
area of heavy cover where Mr.
Stevenson was attacked by the
wounded grizzly bear," Faulkner
said in a news release late Friday.
"Mr. Bell was able to shoot the
bear multiple times, eventually
killing it," he said.
Bell used his cell phone to call
for help but Stevenson died from
his injuries, Faulkner said.
The area is extremely remote,
with no roads and poor com-
munications, said Ron Aasheim
of the Montana Department

hunter
of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
Authorities reached the scene in
helicopters.
"This is big-time back coun-
try," he said. "There are no roads
even close to this thing."
Authorities said the two were
part of a four-person hunting
party going after black bears
in the area when the attack
occurred. Faulkner said the party
had split up earlier into two-
member teams.
The incident is under investi-
gation. It is illegal to kill a grizzly
bear, which is listed as threat-
ened in the Lower 48 states.
There was no immediate word if
Bell would face any charges.
This is at least the third man
killed by a grizzly since July.

Attack on tens of
thousands labeled
deadliest in months
SANAA, Yemen (AP) - Yeme-
ni government forces opened
fire with anti-aircraft guns and
automatic weapons on tens of
thousands of anti-government
protesters in the capital demand-
ing ouster of their longtime ruler,
killing at least 26 and wounding
dozens, medical officials and wit-
nesses said.
After nightfall, Sanaa sank
into complete darkness after a
sudden power outage, as protest-
ers took control of a vital bridge,
halting traffic and setting up
tents. Thousands of other pro-
testers attacked government
buildings and set fires to build-
ings they said were used by snip-
ers and pro-government thugs.
The attack was the deadli-
est in months against protesters
and comes as tensions have been
escalating in the long, drawn-out
stalemate between the regime
and the opposition. The presi-
dent, Ali Abdullah Saleh, left for
Saudi Arabia for treatment after
being severely wounded in a June
3 attack on his palace, raising
hopes for his swift removal - but
instead, he has dug in, refusing to
step down.
The protest movement has

stepped up demonstrations the
past week, angered after Saleh
deputized Vice President Abed
Rabbo Mansour Hadi to negoti-
ate a power-transfer deal. Many
believe the move is just the latest
of many delayingtactics.
At the same time, greater num-
bers of the powerful Republican
Guards force, led by Saleh's son
and heir apparent Ahmed and
armed regime supporters have
also been turning out in the streets
in recent days, raising fears of a
new bloody confrontation.
More than 100,000 protest-
ers massed yesterday around
the state radio building and gov-
ernment offices, witnesses said.
When the crowd began to march
toward the nearby Presidential
Palace, security forces opened
fire and shot tear gas canisters,
they said. Snipers fired down at
the crowd from nearby rooftops,
and plainclothes Saleh support-
ers armed with automatic rifles,
swords and batons attacked the
protesters. Protesters tfak con-
trol of a main bridge, closed off
the entrances and set fire to tents
in a camp used by pro-govern-
ment forces.
"This peaceful protest was
confronted by heavy weapons
and anti-aircraft guns," said
Mohammed al-Sabri, ant opposi-
tion spokesman. He vowed that
the intensifying protests "will
not stop and will not retreat."

26 killed
At the neighborhood of al-
Zubairi in the heart of Sanaa,
troops opened fire at an anti-gov-
ernment force, the 1st Armored
Division led by Maj. Gen. Ali
al-Ahmar, who defected to the
opposition along with his 50,000
troops several months ago.
Witnesses said al-Ahmar's
forces engaged in the fight-
ing yesterday for the first time,
but Abdel-Ghani al-Shemari,
spokesman for al-Ahmar divi-
sion denied that and said they are
"maintaining self-restraint."
Tarek Noaman, a doctor at
Sanaa field hospital, said that 26
protesters were shot dead and
more than 200 were wounded.
"Most of the injuries are at the
chest, shoulder, head and face,"
he said, and said 25 of injured pro-
testers were in critical condition.
He accused security forces
of preventing ambulances from
evacuatingthe wounded and col-
lecting bodies of the slain pro-
testers.
A Yemeni opposition televi-
sion network carried live video
of men carrying injured protest-
ers on stretchers, including a
motionless man whose face was
covered with blood and eyes
wrapped with bandages. Other
young men were lying on the
floor in the chaotic field hospital.
Men on motorcycles rushed the
injured from the square to field
hospital.

RENO, Nev. (AP) - The
death toll rose to nine Saturday
in an air race crash in Reno as
investigators determined that
several spectators were killed
on impact as the 1940s-model
plane appeared to lose a piece
of its tail before slamming like
amissile into a crowded tarmac.
Moments earlier, thousands
had arched their necks skyward
and watched the planes speed
by just a few hundred feet off
the ground before some noticed
a strange gurgling engine noise
from above. Seconds later, the
P-51 Mu stang dubbed The Gal-

immediate nosedive into a sec-

and bodies as screams of "Oh

crowd.

and they were looking at ama-
teur video clips that appeared
to show a small piece of the
aircraft falling to the ground
before the crash. Witnesses
who looked at photos of the part
said it appeared to be an "eleva-
tor trim tab," which helps pilots
keep control of the aircraft.
Reno police also provided a
GPS mapping system to help
investigators recreate the crash
scene.
"Pictures and video appear
to show a piece of the plane was
coming off," NTSB spokesman
Mark Rosekind said at a news
conference. "A component has
been recovered. We have not
identified the component or if it
even came from the airplane ...
We are going to focus on that."
Investigators said they also
recovered part of the tail sec-
tion, where the tab is located.
A tour near the site offered
to journalists Saturday eve-

ning revealed debris spread in
a fan-shape over more than an
acre around a crater roughly 3
feet deep and as much as 8 feet
across. Based on the crater's
location, it appears the P-51
Mustang went straight down
in the first few rows of VIP box
seats, or about 65 feet in front of
the leading edge of the grand-
stand.
Yellow crime tape surround-
ed the scene and spectator seats
remained askew.
Among the dead were the
pilot and eight spectators. Offi-
cials said 69 people were treat-
ed at hospitals, including 36
who have been released and 31
who remain there. Nine were in
critical condition late Saturday.
One of the victims was iden-
tified Saturday as 22-year-old
Michael Wogan of Phoenix,
who was in a wheelchair the
VIP section when the plane
crashed, the Arizona Republic
reported. Wogan, who suffered
from muscular dystrophy, was
killed and his father, Bill, lost
an eye and some fingers and
sustained serious facial inju-
ries, the Wogan family told the
newspaper.

Marine suicide sparks
hazing inquiry in Hawaii

Three Marines face
charges after death
of Lance Cpl.
HONOLULU (AP) - In the
chilly pre-dawn hours of April
3 in Afghanistan, Marine Lance
Cpl. Harry Lew crouched down
in the foxhole he'd been ordered
to dig for disciplinary reasons -
he'd repeatedly fallen asleep on
guard duty - placed the muzzle
of his gun in his mouth and pulled
the trigger.
Three Marines - Lew's squad
leader, a sergeant, and two of his
fellow lance corporals - have
been charged with wrongfully
humiliating and demeaning Lew.
The two lance corporals have also
been charged with assault, and
one was charged with cruelty and
maltreatment.
A military Article 32 hearing
on whether the men should be
court-martialed on these charges
was held earlier this month at
Marine Corps Base Hawaii in
Kaneohe Bay.
In a case with mild echoes of
the 1992 Hollywood movie "A
Few Good Men," the hearing into
the 21-year-old's suicide sought to
determine whether Lew's fellow
Marines hazed him in the hours
leading up to his death. Testimony
was also given that the Marines
were trying to help Lew.
The commander of the Hawaii-
based 3rd Marine Regiment, Col.
Nathan Nastase, will determine
whether the three Marines will be
tried after he reviews the recom-
mendations of the officer who pre-
sided over the hearing.
The hearing depicted a squad
of Marines actively fighting on

the front lines while at the same
time dealing with Lew's problems.
Commanders said in retrospect
Lew may have been suffering from
depression or some other medical
condition.
Lew had fallen asleep several
times on watch duty, when his life
and the lives of his fellow Marines
depended on him being awake and
alert. His leaders tried various
approaches to keep him awake,
including taking him off patrols so
he could get more rest, according to
testimony at the hearing.
But on Lew's last night, those
efforts escalated into alleged
acts of violence and humiliation,
according to the charges heard.
The Marines are accused of punch-
ing and kicking him, making him
do push-ups and pouring sand in
his face.
Lew, the nephew of U.S. Rep.
Judy Chu of California, joined the
Marine Corps after graduating
from Santa Clara High School and
studying at Mission College in Cal-
ifornia. His first assignment was to
join the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines
at Kaneohe Bay.
In November, he deployed to
Afghanistan. Four months into his
tour, the Marine Corps sent Lew to
join a squad at Patrol Base Gowragi
- a remote outpost in Helmand
province the U.S. was establishing
to disrupt Taliban drug and weap-
ons trafficking.
Enemy forces engaged the base
on Lew's first day there, March 23.
That night, Lew fell asleep dur-
ing watch duty - the first of four
times he would do so in his 10days
at Gowragi.
A few days later, while the squad
was on its own ambush patrol, he
dozed off while on watch.
On April 2, the executive officer

of the regiment, a lieutenant colo-
nel, and the battalion executive
officer, a major, found Lewsleeping
on watch duty while they toured
the base at 11 a.m. Lew's head was
tilted back, his mouth was open,
and his eyes were closed, testified
Capt. Michael Regner, the Golf
Company commanding officer who
escorted the other officers.
The platoon's commander, 1st
Lt. Jameson Payne, testified that
removing Lew from the outpost
wasn't an option.
"There was no reserve of
Marines to replace a Marine who
was tired. Everyone was tired,"
Payne said at the Article 32.hear-
ing, which is similar to a civilian
grand jury proceeding.
Lew was found asleep on watch
again the night of April 2 after he
didn't respond to a radio check at
11:15 p.m.
According to a command inves-
tigation report, the squad's leader,
Sgt. Benjamin Johns, told Lew's
fellow lance corporals over the
radio that "peers should correct
peers."
. Johns woke up another Marine
who was due to relieve Lew at 1
a.m. and had him take over the job
early. Lew was ordered to dig a fox-
hole deep enough for him to stand
in, so he would stay awake while on
watch.
The Marines confronted Lew
about his falling asleep and cri-
tiqued his digging of the hole.
After 2 a.m. Lance Cpl. Charles
Orozco III told Lew to do push-
ups, crunches and planks. Orozco
also told Lew to hoist a sandbag
while exercising, and, according to
the command's investigative report
on the incident, stomped on Lew's
back and legs if Lew failed to do his
repetitions properly.

Hugo Chavez to
receive last round'
of chemotherapy

Chavez is
'confident' in
overcoming cancer
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)
- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez headed back to Cuba
on Saturday night for a fourth
phase of chemotherapy that he
expects to be his last round of
treatment for cancer.
Supporters saw off Chavez
with songs and a prayer outside
the presidential palace before
he left for the airport along with
Bolivian President Evo Morales,
who was accompanying him to
the island.
Chavez told the crowd that he
is confident he is overcoming the
illness.
"I'm sure that this week we
will close the cycle of chemo-
therapy and we will be turning
the page," he told supporters,
standing at the doors of the pres-
idential palace.
"Chavez's cancer is now part
of this history," he added, liken-
ing it to the short-lived coup he
survived in 2002.
Chavez waved to the crowd

wearing the red beret and
fatigues from his years as an
army paratroop commander.
He said he expected to under-
go medical tests in Havana on
Saturday night and then resume
chemotherapy Sunday.
Chavez said he and Morales
both planned to meet with
Cuban President Raul Castro.
Later, a military band played
Venezuela's national anthem
at the, airport as Chavez and
Morales prepared to board their
flight to Havana. Chavez said
he would return to Venezuela
before next weekend.
Chavez underwent surgery in
Cuba in June to remove a tumor
from his pelvic region. Since
then, he has undergone three
rounds of chemotherapy treat-
ments, two of those in Cuba.
He has lost weight, and since
the beginning of August he has
appeared with his head shaved
after his hair began to fall out
due to chemotherapy.
The 57-year-old leader has
said that the treatment aims
to prevent any cancerous cells
from reappearing and that tests
have shown no signs of a recur-
rence.

A publicly-owned route
Second bridge to Canada should be state funded
ravel from Detroit to Canada will hopefully be getting
easier in the coming months. A second bridge that would
connect Detroit to Windsor is currently being discussed
between several parties. While many people are in favor of the
project, a large roadblock must be overcome: Who should have the
right to build the new bridge.

If funded by the state, the project, known
as the New International Trade Crossing,
will provide a means for efficient commer-
cial and passenger traffic flow under mutual
ownership by the Canadian and Michigan
governments. However, the Moroun family -
who privately owns the Ambassador Bridge
tharonnects Canada to the United States
- wants the right to build the second bridge
themselves. Lawmakers should not allow the
Moroun family to persuade them, and the
project should remain publicly owned.
Matthew Moroun, vice chair of the
Moroun. family's Detroit International
Bridge Company, is against Snyder's proposal
for a publicly owned, yet privately-operated
project, since the NITC bridge would create
competition with the Ambassador Bridge.
Moroun has stressed the importance of
maintaining complete private sector control
over the bridges. By emphasizing the success
that the Ambassador Bridge has had since
the 1970s as a structure free of government
control, Moroun hopes to persuade legisla-
tors to turn the NITC into a privately-owned
and operated project.
However, a publicly-operated bridge will
boost the state economy. The state will hire
a private company to construct the passage,
but all generated revenue will be granted to
the state treasury. Public construction is a
great way to help decrease Michigan's current
unemployment rate. Since a private company
would construct the bridge, the endeavor
would create much-needed jobs in Michigan.

Construction of a second bridge will give
the state and Canada many financial ben-
efits. Michigan's economy is in dire need of a
boost, and public projects like the NITC can
help. If the bridge is privatized, all the money
goes to the Moroun family, which has had a
monopoly on automobile travel to and from
Canada since it purchased the Ambassa-
dor Bridge. Making the bridge public would
allow the state to implement tollbooths
across the span of the bridge, which would
produce revenue that could further build up
the state's economy.
The project gained the attention of Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder and was included in
his State of the State address last January.
Snyder stressed the importance of inter-
national trade for the Michigan economy,
particularly for the individual farmer and
manufacturer. Adding a second connector
bridge will make trade between the United
States and Canada easier. Engaging in a
strong international trade partnership with
Canada makes the NITC that much more
productive for the state.
Lawmakers should oppose Moroun's
efforts for a privately-owned and operated
NITC. Michigan can greatly benefit from
this second bridge that will become an inte-
gral part of the state. The economic benefits
from the construction of the bridge alone
will be worthwhile. And when one consid-
ers the benefits that will be accrued once the
bridge is up and running, it would be foolish
not to back the state-sponsored project.

arlier this summer, the Mis-
souri and Big Sioux rivers
crested their banks and flood-
ed a wide area
around Sioux
City, Iowa. That
in and of itself is
not news - many
of the major
rivers in the
Midwest flood '
regularly, and
the Missouri had NEILL
already caused MOHAMMAD
hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in
damage to Bismarck, N.D. before the
floodwaters moved further down-
stream and reached Sioux City.
In election years, small, nonde-
script communities sometimes take
on larger meanings. Most of the
time, this happens because politi-
cal pundits need metaphors to make
their jobs easier. A good example
of this would be the victory of a
Republican, Bob Turner, in the
recent special election to replace
former Rep. Anthony Weiner in
New York's 9th Congressional Dis-
trict. He's only one representative
out of 435, and since New York is
about to lose a House seat in the
next Congress, Turner will likely be
out of a job ina few months anyway.
But, like Richard Dreyfuss's mashed
potatoes in "Close Encounters of
the Third Kind," the election has to
mean something.
One of the towns on the banks of
the Missouri that flooded this sum-
mer was Dakota Dunes in South
Dakota. Dakota Dunes is a planned
community, and is home to some
very wealthy South Dakotans as
well as an Arnold Palmer-designed
golf course to entertain them. But,
as a New York Times report gen-
tly pointed out, the name "Dakota

Dunes" was not an accident. The
dunes were created by river floods,
and so it stood to reason that at
some point the floodwaters would
come again.
Of course, just because something
"stands to reason" doesn't make it
a popular or widely-accepted idea.
Only 172 homes in Dakota Dunes
actually had flood insurance when
the disaster struck. Of the home-
owners who were insured, most
of them were forced into carrying
insurance by their mortgage provid-
ers. Anyone who wasn't fortunate
enough to be forced into making
the sensible decision to carry flood
insurance while living in a flood
plain was lost. Except they weren't
entirely lost because the residents
of .Dakota Dunes promptly started
asking for government assistance.
They got $15 million in no-interest
loans from South Dakota, and they
now want the federal government
to cover 75 percent of the remaining
cleanup costs.
Congressman Ron Paul got in
some trouble last week for saying
something honest during Monday's
Republican presidential debate.
Moderator Wolf Blitzer gave him
the sort of pandering, heart-rending
hypothetical question that always
comes up during presidential
debates: Given that you are against
any health care reform that forces
individuals to purchase coverage,
would you be willing to let someone
die who had developed a fatal dis-
ease after opting not to be insured?
In a pique of intellectual honesty,
Paul said "yes," he would. I don't
agree with Paul on a lot of things:
not on health insurance and not even
on what the word "money" means. I
do give him credit though for being
willing to admit the implications of
his politics. He doesn't have a lot of

company in that regard. Republican
front-runner and Texan Gov. Rick
Perry spent most of his week claim-
ing that he doesn't actually believe
Social Security is a bad idea even
though he just wrote a book in which
he called it a "Ponzi scheme."
Sometimes
the truth is
inconvenient.
Admitting those implications is
exactly why Paul isn't going to be
president. No one enjoys being con-
fronted with the long-term impli-
cations of their decisions. Primary
voters, in particular, want to hear
crazy ideas - things that those "fat
cats in Washington don't want you
to hear!" - and they have no inter-
est in dealing with consequences.
Slash taxes, but only stop spending
on those things that benefit "other
people" - spending on projects in
your neck of the woods is always a
good idea. Privatize Social Security,
but pretend that privatization will
never run the risk of more seniors
finding themselves in poverty dur-
ing retirement.
Or, if we start thinking about
South Dakota once again - build
your house in a flood plain, refuse
to purchase flood insurance and
then ask your fellow taxpayers to
foot the bill when your house gets
flooded. It's disingenuous and self-
serving, but it's also where the
smart money is.

Migrate to Detroit

Itwas the firstweek ofasummer, andIhad no
idea what was in store for me as I moved into
my Midtown apartment. I signed up to spend
two months living in the heart of Detroit, tak-
ing classes and interning, as a part of the Uni-
versity's Semester in Detroit program. Having
always been a suburbanite, my migration to
the city may have seemed unusual. I thought
I had already enjoyed most of the city's assets
from the outside by going to sporting events,
concerts and museums. Still, something I
couldn't quite put my finger on compelled me
to join the program.
At first, I didn't realize what an incredible
impact living in an environment removed from
a suburban landscape would have. I can't deny
that I started the program with reservations. I
wasn't quite sure what I would be doing day in
and day out, but the more I explored the sur-
rounding area, the more I realized how stimu-
lating life in Detroit was. The overall character
of the city - which included art-deco skyscrap-
ers, grit and a post-industrial edge - was total-
ly captivating. I was intrigued by the history
and countless opportunities for young creative
types in a place that appeared a sleeping giant.
Aside from classes that better acquainted
me with Detroit's past, what I found most
engaging was my internship with Detroit City
Council member Saunteel Jenkins. Jenkins
serves as chair for the Planning and Economic
Development Committee. Having studied
social work during her undergraduate and
graduate education, she offered a perspective
that was not only business-minded but, more
importantly, took into account what would
most benefit the people in the communities
she represents - exemplifying a kind of com-
passion and understanding that one rarely
comes across.
During the course of my internship, I helped
facilitate the committee's weekly hearings,
and my awareness of trending development
heightened. As I listened, I became further
convinced that Detroit, particularly the down-
town area, was ready to expand dramatically.
New restaurants, bars and swanky loft devel-
opments often graced the weekly agenda con-
cerning the few core blocks that hadn't already
been a part of recent building projects.

My inner real estate junkie thrived as I
grew determined to have a stake in the city's
future. Both the 20-something entrepreneurs
and weathered businessmen actively growing
the economy left me feelingthat anyone could
find his or her niche, especially as the city was
seeking to redefine and heighten its unique
character. That's one of the most refreshing
things about Detroit. There's no exclusive
group that holds the key to its future. The city
has opened its doors to anyone with ambition,
and the results are apparent in examining the
array of new businesses, including a hostel,
boutiques, salons, creperies and cafes.
The entrepreneurial spirit exemplifies a
major component of what will help carry
urban centers in this post-industrial period.
The small business owners who fulfill specific
markets enable differentiation and make an
area more resistant to the rising and falling
tides of Wall Street. It also creates an environ-
ment that is convenient and enjoyable, which
is incredibly important in an age when people
can shop for a city to live in.
Not only by gaining knowledge of what was
happening on the city's development side, but
by taking into account the integrity and enthu-
siasmofmypeersinthe program, diditbecome
undeniable that talented young people want to
be in a place where they can see the tangible
results of their work. As students, we recog-
nized the incredible character of Detroit and
had the ability to see through some of the dif-
ficult circumstances thathave long plagued her
in order to re-imagine the future.
Those two monthsnot only changed my per-
spective on vocation, but by immersing myself
in a program and city that was entirely differ-
ent from anythingI'd ever known, Iwas able to
become more cognizant of my own beliefs and
passions - leaving me forever changed and for-
ever grateful for my experience.
Emily Dabish is an LSA senior.
Today fromS p.m. to 6:30 p.m. there is a
lecture entitled "Economic Development in
Post-Industrial Detroit"featuring Detroit City
Council member SaunteeliJenkins. It will take

Afraid of the dark

What the hell is going on
around campus? It's a
question most Univer-
sity students have been extremely
confused and
frightened over.
Five sexual
assaults have
occurred near
campus since
July - one as
recently as last
week. A hand-
ful of robber- EMILY
ies - armed and ORLEY
unarmed - have
occurred in the
last two months - two being within
campus boundaries. Since July 16, I
have received 10 U-M Department of
Public Safety crime alerts.
At the beginning of the school
year, Ann Arbor Police Chief Bar-
nett Jones met with The Michigan
Daily and told staff members that
students need to take every pre-
caution to ensure they don't find
themselves in a dangerous situa-
tion. But, as shown by the incidents
that have occurred, sometimes you
can take precautions and still get
attacked while waiting for the bus.
And where is the line supposed to be
drawn between being cautious and
being constantly fearful?
I returned to Ann Arbor this year
for my fourth and final year. When
I moved into my freshman dorm
room in the fall of 2008, my mom
put a whistle on my desk and told me
to carry it with me. Never once in
three years did I do so. But last week
- after waking up to yet another
DPS crime alert e-mail - I decided

to pull it out and actually put it on
my key ring.
I believed the person or people
behind the attacks felt confident in
the summer with campus somewhat
empty and thought when campus
filled up again in the fall they would
disappear. But that doesn't appear
to be the case. In fact, some might
argue that copycat crimes are begin-
ning to occur. Though I know my
way around this campus very well, I
find myself extremely nervous walk-
ing around after dark, even with
other people.
The University has created a
website with information about the
attacks and details on how to get
around campus safely or get help.
But the "risk reduction techniques"
are missing one very important skill:
How to protect yourself if you are
attacked. Right before I came back to
school, I read about aclassthat teach-
es self-defense - Psych 401.004.
However, when I went to enroll in
the class, I was unable to because the
class is a 400 level psychology class,
and there is a psych prerequisite. I'm
not sure why it is necessary to have
a prerequisite for a class that teaches
students how to protect themselves.
Am I less fit to take the class because
I am an English major?I would argue
no, and I think many others would
say the same.
The attacks occurring around
campus are not isolated. Something
is going on in Ann Arbor, and the
perpetrator(s) seem to always be
multiple steps ahead of the police.
With more than 600 tips to follow
up on, it is hard to blame the police,
but it is frightening all the same that

this person(s) has continued to be
successful in attacking students and
remaining at large.
Thankfully, none of the survivors
were kidnapped, but the story of
Lauren Spierer is constantly in the
back of my mind. Spierer, a 20-year-
old student, disappeared in June on
a popular street - one similar to
Church Street - at Indiana Univer-
sity. Spierer is still missing. No one
knows what happened to Spierer,
but her disappearance from a big col-
lege town and the continuing attacks
around our big college town are eerie
to me.
Crimes near the
'U' have students
feeling uneasy.
Going to school in Ann Arbor
has made many students feel they
are immune to the dangers of the
"real world." Our bubble was not hit
nearly as hard during the economic
crash, our bubble has not been the
center of any major political issues
and, until recently, our bubble has
been considered very safe. But recent
events have forced me to change my
opinion of Ann Arbor. I can't help
but wonder, what the hell is going
on around campus? And when is it
going to stop?

ID
From Page 1A
The Heidelberg," Madeka wrote.
"More often than not, bars tend
to reject my ID."
According to Jerome Hig-
gins, manager of Ashley's on
State Street, his business does
not always refuse international
IDs, but if the ID presented does
not match up to the picture in an
international ID book, the bar
will refuse customers and sug-
gest they get an alternate form of
identification.
Similarly, Aaron Allen, a man-
ager at Buffalo Wild Wings on
State Street, said the restaurant
currently has an international ID
book employees can use to prove
the IDs are legitimate. Allen said
if the ID is not posted in the book,
which Song's ID may not have
been, the restaurant will refuse
customers if they cannot find a
comparable image online.
However, Allen and Higgins
said their respective restaurants
will accept passports from inter-
national students as a form of
identification. According to Hig-
gins, Ashley's typically accepts
passports since the staff can
verify their legitimacy with more
ease than other forms of interna-
tional identification.
"Passports are a little harder
to forge I think," Higgins said.
"International IDs - we have no

idea what we're looking at half
the time."
Song said he realizes that car-
rying his passport to bars and
restaurants would ease the dif-
ficulties in verifying his age, but
doing so would be difficult and
risky.
'Most of the (local bars), what
they said is that if you have the
passport, that is absolutely OK,"
Song said. "But why would you
carry a passport with you every
day? If I lose it, it's such a hassle
to replace it."
Michael Gradillas, manager
of the Blue Leprechaun pub on
South University Avenue, said the
restaurant accepts passports, but
he prefers international students
to try and obtaina Michigan ID.
"My best advice would be to try
and obtain a state ID from Michi-
gan," Gradillas said. "If they don't
want to do that or can't do that,
just bring their passport and any
other identification that can sup-
port that."
Gradillas recognizes the
inconvenience this poses to inter-
national students, but he said he
believes it ensures the Blue Lep-
rechaun remains lawful in its
practices.
"We've gotten a lot of fake
international driver's licenses
before," Gradillas said. "...We are
just trying to protect ourselves
and make sure the people are
who they say they are and the IDs
aren't fake."

While Madeka, the Engineer-
ing senior from India, wrote that
he understands the prevalence of
fake international IDs on campus
and why bouncers need to scru-
tinize his ID, he wrote that they
should be better trained at verify-
ing international IDs.
"Most international IDs con-
tain smart card chips that are
incredibly difficult to falsify and
numerous other checks," Made-
ka wrote. "Even a basic educa-
tion in these matters could go a
long way in making matters more
convenient for international stu-
dents."
Song also said he understands
the difficulties local bars and
restaurants face as far as verify-
ing international IDs. Though it
may take extra time for him to
order his drinks or enter bars,
he said he feels for the most part
thatthebusinesses treathimwith
respect.
"Sometimes I do feel like I'm
getting a different kind of treat-
ment because they just take much
more time to look at it," Song said.
"But for most of the time I think
they're doinga greatjob."
Nonetheless, Song said he is
considering making the process
easier by obtaining a form of iden-
tification from the United States.
"I've been thinking a lot about
getting a U.S. ID or license so it's
not so much of a hassle and to
make things easier for me and for
them," Song said.

versity Law School press release
that the school will offer its stu-
dents necessary skills to improve
Indian communities. Kumar
wrote that the new project will
allow for "a unique avenue for
teaching, research, training and
capacity-building initiatives for
the study of infrastructure law
and policy."
Vikramaditya Khanna, a Uni-
versity Law School professor and
co-director of the initiative, said
the center's goals are to estab-
lish policy regarding global,
corporate and financial law and
to create an environment where
students can embrace chang-
ing areas of study. Through his
involvement in the development
of the center, Khanna said he is
optimistic about the prospects
the new project provides for
future generations of students
studying at the University and

abroad.
The center will also serve as
a bridge between Michigan and
India, as many jobs continue to
be outsourced to India, Khanna
said.
"Places that students fre-
quent, that you are all aware of,
are moving business overseas,
and that is the reality," Khanna
said. "The vast majority (of com-
panies) receive over 50 percent
of their revenue from outside the
United States."
He added that Coca Cola
receives more than 80 percent
of its revenue from outside the
country, and noted Ann Arbor-
based Domino's Pizza has 300
stores in India with 52 percent of
its revenue being generated out-
side of U.S. borders.
"It's no longer obvious that,
out of college, first jobs will be
in the U.S.," Khanna said. "At
this point, you may even prefer it
elsewhere."
Khanna's attention on India
spans much of his academic
career, and he spends a major-
ity of his time researching the
country because he thinks it is
an important template for infra-
structure projects in developing
countries.
"I partially became interested
in this topic because my family
is from India, but I think what
really got me interested was the
fact that some years ago I start-

ed doing research on corporate
structures in emergingmarkets,"
he said.
Infrastructure issues extend
far beyond India, Khanna said.
He added that he continues to
see similar effects in countries
like Brazil and China.
After teaching a class at the
University on economic devel-
opment in India, he began to
focus on emerging structures
and infrastructure deals in other
countries. He added that the
course made him realize that
the expansion of infrastructure
projects in India could influence
changes in other countries, bear-
ing in mind that cultural differ-
ences impact business.
When developing infrastruc-
ture projects like the initiative
in India, people working on the
projects must be aware of the
cultural and legislative barriers
that could hinder the success-
ful development of projects, he
explained.
"There are myriad impor-
tant and often complicated legal
issues involved in the infrastruc-
ture field," Khanna said. "By
developing courses, research
programs and events, we'll be
able to rely on the considerable
expertise at Michigan, Jindal
and (the Infrastructure Devel-
opment Finance Company) to
begin to address these important
issues."

Hassan said he promised the city
he would not stock any sex toys at
his store. Instead, he is planning
to sell the items he already pur-
chased through an online store he
is creating for Bongz and Thongz.
"(We're selling) just lingerie,
costumes and accessories that
don't have anything to do with
genitalia," said Hassan, describing
his new in-store inventory.
City Council member Sabra Bri-

ere (D-Ward 1) said the ordinance
is "a major part of downtown plan-
ning," and the city is unlikely to
overturn it.
"I think the problem is not the
city -it's the business model," Bri-
ere said. "The people who decided
that this was what they wanted to
open did not check the city's ordi-
nances about what was allowed."
City Council member Chris-
topher Taylor (D-Ward 3) said
changing the city's zoning ordi-
nance is a "relatively long" pro-
cess, and Bongz and Thongz will
probably never be able to return to

its original business plan.
"I have no reason to think that
the ordinance is anything but
good for the city," Taylor said. "I
don't think Bongz and Thongz is
good for the downtown."
Despite difficulties with the
city, Hassan said his and Abouna's
business has been fairly successful
in its first week. He plans to fill the
downstairs area of the store - the
space originally intended for sex
toy sales - with Halloween cos-
tumes for the upcoming holiday
and expects business will contin-
ue to improve.

Three home invasions
reported i n Northwood

Northwood IV
residents report
laptop, cash stolen
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter
Residents of three different
units in Northwood Community
Apartments reported to the Uni-
versity's Department of Public
Safety yesterday that their prop-
erty hadbeen stolen from the first
floor of their apartments while
they were upstairs sleeping,
according to DPS spokeswoman
Diane Brown.
In an interview yesterday
evening, Brown said the alleged
home invasions took place in
the 1100, 1400 and 1500 blocks
of McIntyre Drive - which
constitute Northwood IV. She-
added that police believe the
time frame of the three home
invasions is between 1 a.m. and
11 a.m. yesterday morning. How-

ever, none of the residents filed
reports until yesterday after-
noon.
Brown said there were no signs
of forced entry at the apartments.
"All three had left their sliding
glass doors unlocked and did not
have the security bars in place
either," Brown said.
Brown noted that the residents
were not awakened by the bur-
glars but realized their personal
items were missing yesterday
morning, or in some cases, not
until yesterday afternoon.
The residents reported that
a digital camera, laptop com-
puter, cash and other items were
taken from the three apartments,
according to Brown. The mone-
tary value of stolen goods has not
been determined as of yesterday
evening.
Brown posted a crime alert
on the DPS website, and sent an
e-mail alert exclusively to North-
wood residents as of last night.
She said DPS and Housing Secu-
rity officers also would be going

door-to-door on North Campus
yesterday evening to hand out
crime alert fliers to residents.
Engineering sophomore
Michael Yonick, a resident of
Northwood, said he wasn't aware
of the home invasions until he
received a crime alert e-mail yes-
terday evening. He added that
he's not concerned for his safety
afters hearing about the alleged
home invasions.
"This is the first incident I've
ever seen at Northwood, so I feel
like it's generally safe," Yonick
said.
LSA junior Sara Rivera, a
resident advisor in Northwood
Houses - an area of Northwood
that exclusively houses freshmen
- said she was surprised that
the home invasions occurred but
doesn't feel she is in danger.
"I'm an RA here, so I know
the housing security officers,"
Rivera said. "They are very up
on their game, making sure they
know exactly what's going on at
all times."

BAZAAR
From Page 1A
come in and buy something, you
know you're helping out some-
body locally in your community."
Leyland said the bazaar is fill-
ing a niche for budding artists in
Ann Arbor.
"When you look at all the dif-
ferent art galleries and stuff
in town, there's nothing that's
showcasing emerging artists,"
Leyland said. "(The bazaar is)
givingthem a chance to put their
art out there and see how the
public responds to it."
Corryn Jackson, an art-
ist, curator and co-founder
of Streetheart Gallery in Ann
Arbor, said the bazaar gives
emerging local artists an oppor-
tunity to showcase their art for
a lower vendor fee than other
places like the Ann Arbor Art
Fair. The annual summer fair
costs artists more than $300 for
a booth.
"Most artists can't afford that,
especially ifthey are just starting
off," Jackson said. "(The bazaar)
kind of gives them a stepping
stone."
Leyland and Jackson met in
Ann Arbor more than eight years
ago and ran two gallery and vin-
tage clothing stores together in

Chicago. After those ventures,
they decided to start organizing
the monthly bazaars.
"I love vintage clothing more
than anything, and Corryn loves
making and promoting the arts
more than anything," Leyland
said.
Caitlin Dronen, a recent grad-
uate of the University's School
of Art & Design, was one of the
local' artist featured yesterday
for her handmade jewelry, which
is made from sustainable materi-
als.
"In the past year, I've worked
with alot of found materials and
organic materials - teeth, bone,
wood, crystal, leather," Dronen
said. "And the leather is all scrap
leather."
Dronen said she thinks the
bazaar caters to a different con-
stituency than the Ann Arbor
Art Fair, especially due to the
prices of the products.
"This is definitely, I think,
younger and more appropriate
for students on a college cam-
pus," she said.
Cookie Gomez, owner of
Above Ground Hair Studio, has
hosted previous events, includ-
ing a fashion show, in her salon.
She said she was happy to host
the bazaar in her studio this
month because she believes
it supports community build-

ing and offers a chance for Ann
Arbor residents to connect with
artists.
In June, the bazaar was locat-
ed in the Yellow Barn, a perfor-
mance space on West Huron
Street, and featured a local food
vendor. Leyland said the bazaar's
events depend on the atmo-
sphere and capabilities of the
space they are using.She said the
Above Ground Studio was a par-
ticularly suitable location to hold
the bazaar this time of the year.
"This time, we wanted to try
out State Street since all the stu-
dents are back in town and see
if we can get some foot traffic
from (the University)," Leyland
said.
LSA sophomores Emma Kelly
and Kristen Kiluk were drawn
into the store on their way back
from having lunch. Kelly said she
enjoys shopping at thrift stores
and smaller shops that sell local-
ly made products.
"I prefer to buy at resale shops,
especiallyif it's local," Kellysaid.
"I don't really like shopping at
Macy's or big box stores that
much."
Kiluk commented on the
bazaar's lower prices compared
to other vintage stores.
"Lots of vintage stores sell
things for twice the value now,"
she said.

LECTURETOOLS
From Page 1A
large lecture to be more inter-
active. Samson developed the
program and started using the
first version of LectureTools five
years ago.
Schools around the country
including Indiana University,
The Ohio State University, Mich-
igan State University and Texas
A&M University are also using
LectureTools. Because of the
high demand for the program,
Samson and his team have made
LectureTools into a commercial
product, though professors at
the University of Michigan can
still use it free of charge.

Challenging the assumption
that laptops are always distract-
ing to students, studies con-
ducted by Samson demonstrate
increased student attentiveness
during classes when using Lec-
tureTools. The Center for Learn-
ing and Teaching also conducted
studies that have shown similar
results.
"We're seeing that there is
generally an upside, andstudents
are able to ask questions and
interact more, and we have far
more discourse in class than I've
ever had in my 32 years teaching
here," Samson said.
Samson added that this semes-
ter he is experimenting with
allowing students to access Lec-
tureTools on their laptops dur-
ing his lectures. He has a team
of Undergraduate Research
Opportunity Program students
helping him study the benefits
and drawbacks this has for stu-
dents.
Though he didn't disclose
details of upcoming Lecture-
Tools projects, Samson said
he and his team have plans for
improvements to the program.
"There's something coming
that could literally change class-
es, and the way you study that
would integrate LectureTools
with a variety of other resourc-
es," Samson said.
Mika LaVaque-Manty, an
Arthur F. Thurnau professor
and an associate professor of
political science and philosophy
at the University, has been using
LectureTools for three years.
Though he said it took him a
while to adjust to the multitask-
ing it requires, he also said it has
helped himimprovehis teaching
methods and make his classes
more interactive.
"Students feel more comfort-
able about raising their hands
or they feel comfortable about
having a five-minute conver-
sation during a large class
because of LectureTools," he
said.

The only drawback is the time
it takes for students and teach-
ers to get used to the program's
functions, LaVaque-Manty said.
"Some students have differ-
ent kinds of learning styles so
they prefer old-fashioned pen-
and-paper note taking, and that's
totally fine by me," LaVaque-
Manty said. "I make Lecture-
Tools optional."
Josephine Kurdziel, a lecturer
IV of biology at the University
who has used LectureTools for
three years, said the program
makes it possible for her to gauge
students' understanding of con-
cepts in large lectures. The pro-
gram enables her to get students
actively engaged in the material,
especially because LectureTools
allows students to anonymous-
ly ask questions and receive
answers from her and the gradu-
ate student instructors during
lectures.
"If students are just kind of
there and the instructor isn't
asking many questions, they're
just passively listening, and that
isn't the most effective way to
remember material," Kurdziel
said. "You have to kind of work
with the ideas."
LSA freshman Lindsay Roth-
field said LectureTools is useful
for taking notes and following
along during class, but she wish-
es it had more features.
"It's very limited in how you
can organize so you can only put
bullets, and I like to organize my
notes with many different bullets
and dashes," she said.
LSA freshman Maxwell
Geisendorfer said LectureTools
is useful to him in his politi-
cal science class. His only com-
plaint is that occasionally a slide
doesn't show up.
"Other than that, it's just gen-
erally useful, especially in such
a large lecture hall," he said.
"There are almost 300 people in
that class so it's like each person
has a more personalized way of
looking at the lecture notes."

French flick on 'Point'

"Wait, so ... I can turn left from Packard to Hill, but not Hill to Packard? That's messed up."
'Drive' hits

Gosling the hero
in slow-burning
action film
By ANKUR SOHONI
Daily Arts Writer
"Drive" star Ryan Gosling
has a face fit for a superhero -
appropriately, the 31-year-old
"Notebook"
and "Blue
Valentine"star
has made a Drive
career out of
playing the At Quality16
good guy. The and Rave
gentle, quiet FilmDistrict
approach to his
roles has made
him a subtle director's dream
and a teenage girl's sweetheart,
combining to create one of the
most legitimate, marketable
stars of our time. "Drive" is no
different, but it takes the actor
deeper into the introvert that
his pensive, seemingly unfet-
tered visage perpetually guards.

Gosling plays the Driver -
our unnamed action-over-talk
stunt driver protagonist who
doubles as a freelance getaway
man for heist jobs. Much like
Jason Statham's turn as Frank
in the "Transporter" series,
Gosling's Driver is a structured,
my-way-or-the-highway dude
who keeps his mouth shut just
about all the time. The very
first scene of the film shows him
drive a getaway Chevy Impala
for a pair of thieves, maneu-
vering through downtown Los
Angeles, alternating between a
police frequency and a Clippers
game radio broadcast.
We soon get to know the Driv-
er outside of his criminal acces-
sory role - he's a quiet stunt
driver who works in a repair
shop and is on the verge of
becoming a stock car driver for
a couple of L.A. businessman/
thugs (Albert Brooks, "Find-
ing Nemo" and Ron Perlman,
"Hellboy"). He meets his neigh-
bor Irene (Carey Mulligan, "An
Education") and her son Benicio
(newcomer Kaden Leos). Irene's

husband Standard (Oscar Isaac,
"Robin Hood") is in prison, and
in his stead the Driver quickly
assumes a protective role over
mother and child.
When Standard is released
from jail, our protagonist's con-
flict kicks in - Standard can't
escape from his past, particu-
larly his past creditors, and that
same past threatens to come
after Irene and Benicio. The
Driver befriends the father -
despite his affections for his
wife - and chooses to help him
do a job and get the money he
needs. And as one might expect,
things go wrong. Really, really
wrong. Suddenly, the Driver
becomes the target, running
and driving for his life - and
more importantly, for Irene and
Benicio's lives.
The fascinating transforma-
tion in "Drive" is the Driver's
shift from indifference to pur-
pose - like Travis Bickle (Rob-
ert De Niro) in "Taxi Driver,"
the protagonist in "Drive"
explodes outwards by digging

held style of the
modern gritty action film. After
several tense minutes, the chas-
ers catch up and hold the chasee at
gunpoint, only to watch a speed-
ing motorcycle hit him.
Cut to a hospital room, where
Samuel Pierret (Gilles Lellouche,
"Tell No One") watches his wife
Nadia (Elena Anaya, "Talk to
Her") get an ultrasound. This
marks an abrupt shift in the film's
tone, as the scene is lighthearted
and funny - Samuel is an atten-
tive husband, and the couple is
loving and adorable.
When the first two scenes of
a film portray such disparate
worlds, the audience can be cer-
tain they will collide. And they do.
The chasee from the first scene,
thief Hugo Sartet (Roschdy Zem,
"Days of Glory"), ends up in the
hospital where Samuel works as a
nurse's assistant. Late that night,
a man breaks into the hospital
and attempts to kill the wounded
Sartet, only to be saved at the last
minute by Samuel. Here, only a
few minutes into the film, is where
the action begins - and it never
lets up.
The next morning Samuel
is attacked by a gunman in his
apartment, and his pregnant
wife is kidnapped. He is ordered
to break Sartet out of the hospi-
tal by noon, or his wife will be
murdered. This leads Samuel on

How a 'U' alum
brought Tiesto to
Ann Arbor
By CASSIE BALFOUR
Daily Community Culture Editor
It would be easy to forget that
recent 'U' alum Adam Lynn and
his partner Zach Ruben, decked
out in designer suits while sit-
ting in a makeshift VIP room
overlooking the EMU Conven-
tion Center arena - which in
mere hours would host hun-
dreds of rabble-rousers cluster-
ing around the world-renowned
Tigsto - are recent undergrads
who were putting on events at
their respective campuses just a
couple of years ago.
But when the industrious pair
poses in the DJ booth on stage
and Ruben dons Tiesto's head-
phones for a photo-op, they both
grin with matching looks, know-
ing they've created not only a hot
new event promotion company,
but a dream job.
Well, this isn't so much a job
or even a career as it is a capital-
L Lifestyle.
After Lynn graduated from
both the University and his
undergraduate college event
promotion business (the aptly
named Social Studyz), he con-
nected with an equally entre-
preneurial graduate of the
University of Wisconsin in
Madison, Zach Ruben, who
had founded his own company,
Prime Productions. Despite the
rumors that the New York native
Lvnn had hord abo unhRun's

BEHIND THE CONCERTS
The Prime Social network

Tigsto played a show at EMU Convocation Center on Friday.

hometown of Columbus, Ohio,
being the "devil's land," Lynn
and Ruben found common
ground after collaborating on a
four-day college tour featuring
DJ Steve Aoki. They combined
their shared talents and markets
to create the hybrid promoting
company Prime Social Group.
They've done 40 shows since the
start of the year, featuring tal-
ents like the DJ Avicii and Lupe
Fiasco.
But it didn't come easy.
"I was just the kid who sent
an e-mail every day," Lynn said,
talking about how he found
enouv o nneo~ns no start +he

wa
.i

business. "I called every other
day until I got something. You
know the movie 'Wall Street?'
Bud Fox calls Gordon Gekko
every day for a year until he
finally gets an appointment. I
was like Bud Fox."
"Zach is kinda the work-
horse," Lynn added. "It's a very
good partnership ... we're part-
ners but we're friends too, which
is good since there's a lot of trav-
eling and we spend a lot of time
together."
The suave duo may don
designer duds and sip the kind of
vodka Ludacris raps about with
world-renowned musicians, but
they are forced to apologetically
pause the interview intermit-
tently to attend to their con-
stantly buzzing smartphones to
deal with last-minute details.
Ruben's Blackberry calendar
looks to be as crammed with
dates and exotic locales as the
President's. Lynn confirms that
catering to the rich and famous
and hand-crafting events awash
in strobe ligits atnded by
thousands is a 24-hour-a-day
job.
"I don't think people under-
stand what our job really is,"
Ruben said. "They think we just
post Facebook photos and pass
out flyers. -But we're financing
the entire show. The term pro-
moter has a negative connota-
tion. That's because of mainly
nightclub promoters in big cit-
ies."
Lynn added, despite the
schmoozing with celebrities and
traveling to Europe - where they
have connections in cities like
Barcelona that Ruben hooked up
while studying abroad in Spain
- to produce shows, their job is
anything but a constant party.
"It's a way prettier position
that it actually is," Lynn said.

"People are always like, 'You
have the best job ever.' They see
the picture of us with Tiasto....
I wouldn't trade it for anything
but you have to put in the time.
We're at a critical point in our
career - we can take advantage
of this and work our asses off,
or be complacent and say, 'Hey
we've done great this year' and
be done with it ... that's why me
and Zach sort of feed off each
other."
The job certainly has its
perks, and Lynn and Ruben are
constantly networking and hus-
tling to expand their already
skyrocketing business. They
work with a travel agency called
College Travel Experts to pro-
vide a spring break package not
only drenched in sun, but in
electronic-music in Puerto Val-
larta, bringing musical acts like
Steve Aoki down to Mexico to
play exclusively for these spring
breakers.
Although the duo has a lot on
th orizon, Lynn and Ruben
h eir share of stories and
bate e scars from running these
shows and providing top-notch
comfort to musicians and com-
edy acts. Even though they're
used to dealing with celebre-
DJs, the pair isn't immune to
becoming starstruck.
As the opening act warms up
the hundreds of partiers situat-
ed below in the arena, the beats
start to seep into the makeshift
but appropriately swanky VIP
room. The two undergraduate
party planners-turned-bona
fide, savvy businessmen reflect
on their rise.
"It's a career now," Lynn said.
"I wake up in the morning, and
I'm not worrying about classes.
I'm worrying about contracts ...
as they say, I'm still living the
dream."

deep into his own subconscious
and doing vengeful things he
could only have imagined. The
fruit for the viewer is momentary
- it's the look on his face when
he shocks even himself - like an
innocent child bearing witness
to murder, the shock becomes
another obscuring layer in his
mind. As he opens himself up to
usbyreleasinghisviolenttension,
he simultaneously closes himself
off to the film's other characters,
to whom he is suddenly a com-
pletely different person.
Director Nicolas Winding
Refn (the "Pusher" trilogy) and
writer Hossein Amini ("Shang-
hai") don't fully develop the film's
backstory and characters - and
purposefully so. In a film where
each supporting character's past
is his or her handicap and down-
fall, a protagonist with no more
than a face and a job becomes the
one-eyed man, king of the film's
conflict and the only person with

the freedom to be the good guy.
It's a violent, bloody film with
classic touches dating decades
back, despite its contemporary
setting. Most noticeable are its
retro '80s-style pink font and
synth-backed music selections,
which indeed hearken to images
of a masculine-type shadowy
vigilante patrolling the streets
of L.A., albeit one shot on now-
grainy film stock, not on the
beautiful Arri Alexa camera foot-
age "Drive" employs.
When the brutal final scenes
of the film hit magic hour - that
evening time when sunlight
shines straight on - the mood of
the film is already set; the crimes
that were once limited to the
nighttime have oozed into the
daylight and taken over our pro-
tagonist's life. Like Butch Cassidy
or Bonnie and Clyde, he can only
drive so far from his problems.
With a strong cast fronted by
the stone-faced Gosling, "Drive"

too much deadly possibility for
our characters. Ryan Gosling has
described this film as his super-
hero movie, and the comparison
rings true - it's the bubbling-
under-the-surface, superficially
calm hero pic with a hell of a bite.
Like Gosling's face covered in a
splash of blood midway through

the second act, it's a car colliding
with an unsuspecting audience.
It will shock you, and then calm
you, only to leave you open to the
next bloody smack in the face.
And all throughout, we carry the
understanding that our Driver is
on the same page, the innocent
passenger on the most perilous
ride of his life.

31, Eastern Michigan 3

(Top) Redshirt sophomore running back Fitz Toussaint dives for a goal line touchdown against Eastern Michigan.

Defense allows
fewest points since
shutting out Notre
Dame in 2007
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
The first time Eastern Michi-
gan's football team battled
Michigan to rule the roost in
Washtenaw County, it was 1896.
The Wolverines' opponents
were the Normalites, not the
Eagles. And Eastern Michigan
still was named the Michigan
State Normal School.
On Saturday, it looked like the
Eagles, riding a 2-0 record, had
a chance to topple the giant. But

in Michigan's 31-3 victory Satur-
day, defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison's defense just may
have set the Eagles' progression
back to the Normalite days.
It was all run and no pass,
just like in 1896. Though passing
is now a legal part of the game,
Eastern Michigan hardly tried
it.
But it was the Michigan
defense that looked disastrous
from the beginning. That was
almost expected.
Just as Western Michigan
and Notre Dame sliced up the
Wolverines (3-0) for opening-
drive touchdowns in the first
two weeks of the season, East-
ern Michigan quarterback Alex
Gillett opened the game by com-
mandeering an easy drive into
Michigan territory.

His solution was easyenough:
run the ball. It was the same plan
the Eagles used in weeks one
and two to average 331 rushing
yards per game. Michigan got a
heavy dose of two backs whose
names conveniently match the
Eagles' school colors: Greene
and White.
Running backs Javonti
Greene and Dominique White,
a substitute for injured starter
Dominique Sherrer, that is.
But Greene met Black and
things turned in Michigan's
favor.
After the Eagles (2-1) rushed
for 55 yards into enemy terri-
tory, sophomore defensive end
Jibreel Black jarred the ball
loose from Greene. Redshirt
sophomore safety Thomas Gor-
don recovered the fumble and

ended the defense's early-game
woes.
But then, for the third time
this season, the Michigan
offense failed to record a single
point in the first quarter.
Eastern Michigan's jet sweep
series continued to give the Wol-
verine defense fits.
On the ensuing Eagles' drive,
Gillett and the backs - who
combined for 119 rushing yards
in the first quarter alone -
marched inside the Michigan
one-yardw line facing a fourth
down.
Redshirt junior safety Jordan
Kovacs beat his man to the edge
and made the tackle with his
back to the goal line.
"Every defensive player
wants to be in a fourth-and-one

Eastern Michigan coach Ron
English was asked whether he
had a good game plan in defend-
ing Michigan junior quarterback
Denard Robinson Saturday.
English paused, then let out a
hearty laugh.
"Oh shoot, you know?"
Not many people have expla-
nations for what Robinson can
do anymore.
Robinson completed less than

50 percent of his passes for the
second-straight game. But in
Michigan's 31-3 win over East-
ern Michigan, his running left
more people than Englishlaugh-
ing at what he could do.
Robinson used 26 carries
to gain 198 yards. A quarter of
those yards came on one play.
After their first three drives,
the Wolverines found them-
selves behind, 3-0. Robinson's
first four carries netted him just
19 yards. After getting the ball
back on Michigan's three-yard

line, Robinson kept the ball on a
read option and ran up the mid-
dle. He cut to the sideline and
took off.
Eventually, Robinson was
stuck in between redshirt junior
wide receiver Roy Roundtree
and the sideline. He slowed and
tried to cut back but was swal-
lowed up after 52 yards.
"I was kind of being patient,"
Robinson said. "I thought
(Roundtree) was going to prob-
ably push the guy down or some-
thing and I should've just sped

up and just got him and took a
side."
The rest of the drive consist-
ed of four more Robinson rushes
and two passes. It ended with
Robinson faking the read option
and throwing a quick pass to
senior tight end Kevin Koger.
The Eagles couldn't stop Rob-
inson on the ground. Michigan
realized it and gave him the ball

to score 31 unanswered points,

ORTSMONDAY (LUMN
Hart's long road back to Michigan
starts just up the road

n one of those miserable
days, Mike Hart decided
he didn't want to carry
the football anymore.
After his rookie year, the
thought started creeping into
his mind. Then, the Indianapolis
Colts made the Super Bowl and
he stuck
around. But
the doubt was
always there,
wallowing.
"Part of it
was I wasn't
playingthat

said. "It TIM
wasn't as fun. ROHAN
Real busi-
ness-like. I
mean, I enjoyed it when I played,
but at the same time, I didn't look
forward to going to work every
day. I never wanted to look at
football like that."
He even started to doubt
whether he wanted to become a
coach - which had always been
the plan.
"That's when I knew it was
time for me to get away from
this," he said.
The decision, ultimately, was
made for him. After he rushed
for 264 yards in three seasons,
the Colts declined to offer him a
contract asa restricted free agent
this offseason.
He spent his down time work-
ing out as if he'd get another shot.
Hart thought he'd be picked up
before training camp, once the
NFL's lockout was over. But did
he want to keep playing?
When no one signed him, he
had already decided he wasn't
going to wait.
"I knew that I always wanted
to be a coach," he said.
So Ron English's newest qual-
ity control assistant looked on,
high above the field where he ran
for most of his 5,040 yards, from
his spot in the press box, helping
his newteamtry and topple Goli-
ath, his alma mater.
Michigan won, 31-3, and Hart
didn't sing "The Victors."
His team didn't win.
"I'm committed to this team,"
Hart said during the week lead-
ing up to the Michigan-Eastern

am. I am Eastern Michigan. I'm

what I want to do. I think being Since the 2010 season, Wheat-

ley (who is from Michigan) has
coached Syracuse's running
backs. He immediately inherited
a senior running back named
Delone Carter, who rushed for
1,233 yards and who was a fourth
round pick in the 2010 NFL draft.
Carter's backup that season,
Antwon Bailey, is now the lead
back. Now Wheatley has his
first bigtest - turning a career
backup into a star, on a bigstage.
Stay tuned.
But keep in mind, Wheatley
hasn't said outright he wants
Jackson's job either. And he has
said he has goals of becoming
a head coach some day. So if
Wheatley is Jackson's successor,
it may not be for long.
Hart's still only 25. He still has
time, and he's lucky he's out of
the league with good health.
And when he does come back,
the Michigan community will
welcome him with open arms -
damn what he did in the NFL or
at any other coachingstop before
then - because the 5-foot-9 run-
ning back-that-could is one of
those beloved Michigan figures,
like Carr has become.
"I have a lot of respect for
Mike and what he did for Michi-
gan," Hoke said. "He's a good
man. I like the heck out of him."
Like him enough to give him a
job someday?
"I think all of those guys are
always welcome back," Hoke
said.
Hart may just have to wait his
turn.

In the third and final set of
a match against Texas A&M,
senior middle blocker Court-
ney Fletcher called for the ball.
Freshman setter Lexi Dannemi-
ller delivered it right up the
middle. Fletcher swung, but was
blocked by a pair of high-flying
Aggies.

heny dug the careening ball back

ing for redemption, screamed

straight MICHIGAN 3
into the
hardwood. A cool, indelible
smile spread across her face - it
was a recognition of the pow-
erful force that Michigan had
tapped into; its unbridled con-
fidence.
Michigan (12-0) beat Texas
A&M (10-2) in three sets. On
Friday, the Wolverines defeated
Toledo (5-7) and Xavier (7-5)
in four sets, earning them the
Michigan/Adidas Invitational
championship.
It has been said that con-
fidence does not come from
always being right but from not

fearingto be wrong. Fletcher's
self-confidence exuded most
when she found a way to get her
kill in spite of everything else.
"As a senior I know I'm going
to get blocked sometimes,"
Fletcher said. "Volleyball is a
game of mistakes. So if I make a
mistake, I refuse to let it deflate
me and make me lose confi-
dence. If I get blocked I want
to go out and get another kill.
Dannemiller's been working on
going back to hitters, and I've
been working on going after the
ball strong every time, and that
time it worked."
Michigan stuck to what
it does best - spreading its
offense, servingstrong and stay-
ing composed under pressure
- but this weekend the added
confidence yielded some unex-
pected results.
Sophomore outside hitter
Lexi Erwin had the first kill of
the tournament, the very last
kill and nearly every other one
in between. Against Toledo,
Erwin earned her career-high
of 17 kills. This was not unex-
pected.
Michigan coach Mark Rosen
said that Toledo had scouted
McElheny as a threat and chose
to lock her down at the expense
of leaving Erwin open. Erwin
took advantage of the situation,
but that is something every
member of the squad is capable
of doing under the right circum-
stances. But then Erwin did it
again.

position," Kovacs said. "We were
right on the goal line. What more
could you ask for?"
Added Eastern Michigan
coach Ron English: "I think
you've got to score from the one-
inch line. If you can't score from
the half-yard line then you're
going to have a hard time win-
ning."
Opening the second quarter
with another fourth down, this
time from the three-yard line,
English had learned his lesson.
He kicked the field goal, giving
the Eagles their first and only
lead of the day.
The saving grace for Michigan
actually ended up being the East-
ern Michigan trailing away from
their jet sweep package.
On a first down in Wolver-
ines territory early in the second
quarter, English checked in Tyler
Benz, his backup quarterback to
an unfamiliar formation.
"They gave us a little funky
formation," Gordon said. "We
knew something tricky was up."
Gillett took the snap and threw

left to Benz, who had stepped
back from the line. He took a
look downfield and angled a pass
toward the near pylon.
Gordon, though, had "sniffed
it out." He lunged for the over-
throw with his right hand, hold-
ing the receiver off with his left.
"It just came down in my
glove," Gordon said.
The explanation was simple
enough, but the catch was spec-
tacular.
Then junior quarterback
Denard Robinson and the offense
woke up, tacking on two touch-
downs before the halftime break.
Another pair of touchdowns
in the third quarter all but sealed
the game up.
Gillett finished the first half
with 29 passing yards. He ended
the game with 29 passing yards.
Zero second-half passing yards,
throwing just once while facing a
double-digit deficit - that's rare,
even for a run-heavy team.
Hoke pointed to the pressure
provided by his defensive line as
a key factor, saying he "felt them
a little more this week." The front
four were led by junior defensive
end Craig Roh, who finally made
his mark on the stat sheet - and

on the field - with five tackles
and a sack.
It seemed Mattison and the
defense had figured the Eagles
out - after their wide-receiver
pass and flea-flicker (two of just
five passes on the day) stumped
them in the first quarter.
"They came out and threw the
kitchen sink at us in the first half
- some formations we've never
seen - and we stayed calm and
knew eventually they'd have to
play some football," Kovacs said.
But English had a different
explanation.
"To me, the biggest thing that
happened was, we weren't doing
that," English said, thrusting
his fist forward to simulate his
running backs running straight
downfield.
"We were doing this," he con-
tinued, movinghis fistin azig-zag
pattern. "And I thought Michigan
improved obviously, but I know
we can run it. And you have to be
willing to take those tough yards
as a back. That was disappointing
to me."
The Eagles finished with 207
rushing yards, compared to the
Wolverines' 376.

From Page 1B
were no bright lights, no para-
chutists, no College GameDay,
no Desmond Howard, no special
band performances and certainly
no intriguing matchups - Robin-
son made it worth watching.
Sure, he had his struggles. He
was just 7-of-18 passing for 95
yards, two touchdowns and an
interception.
At times, he looked more
like a shot-put thrower than a
Division-I quarterback. After
Robinson underthrew fifth-year
senior receiver Junior Heming-
way and Eastern Michigan's
Latarrius Thomas picked it off
on the Wolverines' first drive of
the game, I'm pretty sure I heard
a few strands of hair being pulled
out Michigan fans' heads.
A few plays later, with the
Wolverines on their own two-
yard line, Robinson rolled right
looking to pass, couldn't find
anybody, danced around in the
end zone, juked a couple defend-

ers, lowered his shoulder, ran to
his right and was tackled at the
line of scrimmage.
I'm tired just from describing
the play. It was a no-gain and the
drive resulted in a punt and more
groans from the stands.
But in a way, that's part of
what makes watching Robinson
so fun: You never know what he's
goingto do.
Most quarterbacks would've
just thrown the ball away. Not
Denard. He'd rather dance
around all day looking for day-
light to run. He'll run 20 yards
backwards, 30 yards sideways
and then 21 forward just to gain
a yard.
With the Wolverines down
3-0 early in the second quarter, a
radio announcer behind me pro-
claimed, "This one is starting to
have the smell of an upset."
I'm not sure what he was
smelling, but there was no way
the Eagles would keep Robinson
bottled up forever.
Two drives later, Robinson
found the light. With the Wol-
verines on their own three yard
line, he found a seam and burst

"We can't be getting behind
at the beginning of the game,"
Kovacs said. "If we want to be a
great defense, we've got to stop
them in their tracks at the begin-
ning of the game.
"We came out a little flat, got
off to a rough start again. There's
definitely some things that we
need to do. We need to come out
with that intensity every game."
In Michigan's first drive of the
second half, Robinson racked up
29 rushing yards and zero pass-
ing, capping the drive off with a
one-yard run up the middle for
the score to give the Wolverines
a 21-3 edge.
He cut left, cut right, sprinted
forward, ran backward, juked
sideways, turned it all around -
everything short of completing
the Hokey Pokey - for 198 total
rushing yards and one touch-
down.
On a day when his game was
clearly off, he out-rushed all of
the Michigan running backs by
himself. He nearlyout-gained the
whole Eastern Michigan team.
And asked after the game
what he felt was wrong with his
passing game, Robinson paused
for a second.
"I always got room for
improvement," he said. "That's
the biggest room."
Even confined to a press room,
he found the open space. I'd say
he's worth the price of admission.

ROBINSON
From Page 1B
the first quarter 0-0.
"As much as you say to a play-
er, 'He's going to make plays,' I
think it can be demoralizing,"
English said.
It was never the design to run
Robinson as much as they did.
Earlier in the week, offensive
coordinator Al Borges said he
wanted Robinson to carry the

ball about 15 to 17 times.
"We don't want to get him
beat up," Michigan coach Brady
Hoke said.
"We're going to play in a pret-
ty physical league, so we have to
make sure we get other ways....
It takes a toll on your body, and
he's not the biggest guy in the
world."
But, while Michigan got 118
yards from junior running back
Vincent Smith, the Wolverines
needed Robinson to continue

running the football because
of his struggles in the passing
game from the outset.
On Michigan's first drive,
Robinson threw behind his
receiver for an interception
while attempting to convert on
fourth down. Early in the second
quarter, fifth-year senior wide
receiver Junior Hemingway had
beaten his cornerback on third
down. Robinson overthrew the
long touch pass.
Robinson finished the game

7-for-18 for just 95 yards and one
interception. He did have two
touchdown passes - his second
going to sophomore wide receiv-
er Drew Dileo - but it was the
second straight game Robinson
had completed just two passes in
the first half.
"I think we just got to be bet-
ter with our feet, setting our feet
on some throws," Hoke said.
"That's usually is where it starts
with a quarterback."
By the end of the game, Rob-

inson got benched - in a good
way. With 39 seconds left in the
game, sophomore quarterback
Devin Gardner trotted out to
take the last three snaps. Two
were handoffs, the final was a
designed quarterback run for
seven yards.
When a quarterback passes
for less than 100 yards and still
controls the game enough so
that the backup quarterback
comes in for mop-up duty, some-
times all you can do is laugh.
