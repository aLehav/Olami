Last year, LSA sophomore 

Lauren 
Schandevel 
and 

Sociology Prof. Dwight Lang 
had an informal discussion 
about the absence of social class 
in University of Michigan class 
curriculum.

Schandevel 
and 
Lang 

both noted that though the 
University 
has 
a 
Women’s 

Studies 
Department 
and 
a 

Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies, which 
intersect with social class, there 
is no major that focuses solely 
on socioeconomic status. Fast 
forwarding to tjos uear, that 
conversation 
has 
motivated 

Schandevel to recruit a team 
of students and speak to other 
faculty 
about 
developing 
a 

potential new interdisciplinary 
major specifically for the study 
of social class.

Schandevel said though few 

programs on social class exist at 
other universities, the discipline 
is timely and needed because of 
the rise in income inequality 
over the past few decades. 
According 
to 
the 
Ecnomic 

Policy Institute, between 2009 
and 2012, the the top 1 percent 
captured 95 percent of income 
growth in The United States.

“I think we’re at a state right 

now in America where income 
inequality is at an all-time 
high,” she said. “There’s really 

Wednesday at the Ford School 

of Public Policy, Public Policy 
Prof. Daniel Raimi moderated a 
discussion about the two major 
presidential nominees’ energy 
and climate policy plans and 
addressed whether automated 
vehicles will have a negative 
or positive impact on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.

The 
panel, 
which 
was 

sponsored by the University of 
Michigan Energy Institute and 
University of Michigan Center 
for Local, State, and Urban Policy, 
was 
titled 
“Energy, 
Climate 

Change, and the 2016 Elections.”

Panelist Mark Barteau, the 

director of the Energy Institute 
and 
professor 
of 
chemical 

engineering, described the vastly 
different 
proposals 
outlined 

by 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee 
Hillary 
Clinton 

and 
Republican 
presidential 

nominee Donald Trump. He 
characterized Clinton’s proposals 
as drawing on the pragmatism 
and 
progressivism 
that 
has 

marked Obama’s presidency and 
raised concerns about Trump’s 
policy proposals because of their 
emphasis on increasing fracking, 
eliminating energy research and 
development and selling federal 
lands.

Barteau noted that, however, 

though 
policies 
have 
been 

outlined, what happens once a 
candidate takes office could be 
different.

“You would expect (Trump) 

to disassemble the Obama legacy 
but he likes to be unpredictable, 
so you don’t know where he might 
head,” Barteau said.

Rackham 
student 
Nathan 

Wood said after the panel that 
he is not convinced that the 
political will exists in the United 
States to push through major 
environmental legislation.

“There are other countries that 

propose bold policies and even 

they have difficulties in trying 
to trickle them down to the state 
and local level,” Wood said. “It is 
a matter of actually implementing 
changes even though people have 
grown up, very much so, doing 
something else.”

Panelist 
Barry 
Rabe, 

professor of public policy and 
environmental policy, said in 
the last 25 years, nearly every 
combination of different political 
party control of the executive and 

legislative branch has existed, but 
no major legislation pertaining to 
the environment has been passed. 
He said not only have politics on a 
national level become increasingly 
gridlocked, but state politics have 
become increasingly polarized 
as state legislatures drift toward 
higher concentrations of one 
party or another.

“(There is) a tendency to either 

make states red or blue rather than 

With less than a week until 

the presidential election, Sen. 
Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) encouraged 
students to vote for Democratic 
presidential 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton at Western Michigan 
University Wednesday discussing 
key issues of her campaign from 
higher education reform and rising 
economic inequality.

Sanders’ 
speech 
primarily 

focused on issues he highlighted 
during 
the 
primaries 
and 

direct 
attacks 
on 
Republican 

presidential 
nominee 
Donald 

Trump. 
This 
strategy 
differs 

from 
other 
surrogates 
who 

recently held rallies in Michigan 
for Clinton, such as Democratic 
vice presidential nominee Tim 
Kaine, who emphasized Clinton’s 
personal strengths and refrained 
from mentioning Trump by name.

“When we talk about the 

economy, we have got to talk about 
the moral economy,” Sanders said. 
“An economy that works for all 
not just the wealthy … We have got 
to rekindle hope in America and 
create an economy that provides 
opportunity for all.”

Ivanka Trump, daughter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, speaks to supporters of her father at a campaign event at the Marriott Hotel in Troy, 
Michigan Wednesday.

Ivanka Trump, the daughter of 

Republican presidential nominee 
Donald Trump, highlighted a lack 
of safe, affordable childcare and tax 
laws that she said negatively impact 
women returning to the workforce 

at a roundtable discussion and 
community 
Q&A 
session 
in 

Michigan Wednesday.

“Every issue is a woman’s issue,” 

Ivanka Trump said. “That being 
said, there are certain areas that 
disproportionately affect women.”

According to a recent aggregate of 

Michigan polls by RealClearPolitics, 
Democratic presidential nominee 

Hillary 
Clinton 
leads 
the 

Republican nominee by 6.4 points 
six days before the election. Despite 
her lead, both campaigns have 
made numerous stops in the state, 
especially in the past few days, in 
hopes of winning Michigan’s 16 
electoral votes.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Donald 

Trump Jr. were also in Michigan 

Wednesday, campaigning for the 
respective candidates.

During the Wednesday event, 

Ivanka Trump, who is an executive 
vice 
president 
of 
development 

and acquisitions for her father’s 
company, The Trump Organization, 
emphasized 
how 
her 
father’s 

policies could help women.

The 
way 
an 
individual 

perceives his or her neighborhood 
safety and quality is predictive 
of their mortality, according to 
a new study by Shervin Assari, 
psychiatric research investigator 
in the School of Public Health. 
This 
predictivity, 
however, 

differs between Black and white 
people.

The 
study, 
soon 
to 
be 

published in the Journal of 
Racial

Health 

Disparities, used data from the 
Americans’ 
Changing 
Lives 

Study, a nationally representative 
study which interviewed 3,361 
white and Black adults 25 years 
of age and older in the United 
States. Using this dataset, Assari 
assessed 
the 
different 
ways 

in which safety and quality 
are measured to analyze self-
reported 
evaluations 
from 

study participants about their 
neighborhood.

Last Thursday, the Michigan 

Court of Claims ruled that 

residents of Flint may sue the state 

government for damages relating 

to the Flint water crisis. 

The crisis began in April 2014, 

when the Michigan Department of 

Environmental Quality switched 

the city’s water source from Lake 

Huron — which also services 

Detroit — to the Flint River. 

Because the Flint River water 

was more corrosive, lead from 

the popes leached into the water, 

exposing residents to poisioning.

Residents initally filed a 

suit on January 21 against Gov. 

Rick Snyder (R) Michigan’s 

departments of Environmental 

Quality and Health and Human 

Services as well as two former 

Flint emergency managers. In it, 

the residents stated the parties 

knew about the crisis for months 

before taking action.

In the decision written by 

Judge Mark T. Boonstra, the court 

dismissed two constitutional 

challenges brought forth against 

the state. These charges were 

in regards to the definition of a 

“state-created danger” and “fair 

and just treatment.”

However, Boonstra upheld 

two other legal challenges. One 

was in regard to the denial of the 

right to due process clause of the 

U.S. Constitution, and the other 

was about the state’s role in the 

direct cause of personal injury. 

These challenges that were upheld 

empower Flint residents to sue the 

state government.

The court also made 

important jurisdictional 

distinctions regarding the 

Emergency Management Law. 

This law, which empowers 

Michigan’s governor to appoint 

an emergency manager to handle 

the financial recovery of a city, 

was applied by Snyder in Flint 

when he appointed Darnell Earley 

and Jerry Ambrose as emergency 

managers in 2013 and 2015.

Boonstra noted that because 

Earley and Ambrose were 

appointed by the state to oversee 

the management of Flint prior 

to the Flint water crisis, Earley 

was acting as a state official and 

not a municipal authority. This, 

according to Boonstra, made the 

state open to restorative litigation.

The 
Books 
Not 
Bombs 

campaign 
boasts 
that 

students from 173 universities 
internationally 
support 
a 

movement 
for 
scholarships 

geared toward Syrian refugees 
including the University of 
Michigan. As of Wednesday, 
883 
University 
students 

signed a petition calling for 
10 
scholarships 
for 
Syrian 

students.

Syria is currently in an 

ongoing civil war which grew 
out of an uprising against the 
regime of President Bashar 
al-Assad in March 2011. Since 
the war began, at least 470,000 
Syrians have died and as many 
as 11 million refugees are 
displaced.

University students involved 

with the scholarship campaign 
presented 
a 
resolution 
to 

Central Student Government 
last Tuesday asking for their 
support. If approved, CSG will 
being work with University 
administrators on next steps in 
creating the scholarships.

LSA junior Haleemah Aqel, 

the head organizer of the 
University chapter of Books Not 
Bombs, wrote in an email CSG 
had originally planned to vote 
on the resolution Tuesday of 
this week but decided to table it 
until their meeting next week, 
on Nov. 7, to allow the campaign 
time to update the resolution.

If the University agrees to 

provide scholarships, it will join 
the Syrian Consortium, a group 
of institutions responding to the 
breakdown of higher education 
within 
Syria 
by 
providing 

scholarships. The consortium 
is facilitated by the Institute 

of 
International 
Education, 

a 
nonprofit 
that 
promotes 

education 
worldwide. 
Other 

universities in the consortium 
include 
the 
University 
of 

Southern 
California 
and 

Michigan 
State 
University, 

which joined last year, according 
to Chris Records, a Books Not 
Bombs campus coordinator.

Aqel 
wrote 
she 
feels 

education is a human right, and 
the Books Not Bombs campaign 
facilitates that right for victims 
of the political turbulence in 
Syria.

“We, with this privilege, 

need to find a way to make 
accessible those opportunities 
for students, and specifically 
Syrians and Syrian refugees, to 
come learn and hopefully after 
all of this ends, give back to 
Syrian civil society or even help 
our society,” she said.

She cited Michigan Gov. Rick 

Snyder’s attempt to suspend 
refugees’ entrance to Michigan 
last year as an example of this 
Islamophobic rhetoric.

As well, she pointed to the 

large number of Syrian refugees 
in 
the 
state 
of 
Michigan, 

specifically in the Ann Arbor 
area, as the reason national 
organizers 
recommended 
a 

campus campaign in addition to 
the petition.

Records said the University 

was a “priority campus” this 
year, meaning the group is 
working 
more 
closely 
with 

student 
organizers 
and 

providing strategic advice, in 
addition to Berkeley University, 
Yale University and Columbia 
University. However, Records 
also said the control of the 
campaign ultimately lies with 
the student organizers, adding 
that 
he 
appreciated 
Aqel’s 

progress.

“She’s doing great grassroots 

work and all the fundamentals 
are in place,” he said. “I’m 
encouraged to see where it

goes.”

So far, these efforts led by 

Aqel and 10 other students 
include 
hosting 
a 
film 

screening and organizing 
informational 
tables 
in 

University buildings such 
as Angell Hall and the 
Chemistry building. Aqel 
said these efforts aim to 
both increase awareness 
of the educational crisis 
in Syria and find students 
willing to sign the petition, 
which in turn strengthens 
their proposal to CSG.

“If 
this 
campaign 

continues 
to 
gather 

signatures, all of that, and 
even support from various 
student 
organizations, 

that will only make this 
call 
for 
scholarships 

much 
stronger,” 
Aqel 

said. “And then it’ll show 
administrators that it’s not 
just me or my team that are 
interested in this, it’s this 
diverse network of students 
that are very interested in 
this campaign.”

Public 
Health 
student 

Lilah 
Khoja 
is 
another 

organizer of the efforts at 
the University who works 
with the Karam Foundation, 
another Syrian nonprofit 
organization co-sponsoring 
Books 
Not 
Bombs. 

Khoja said the campaign 
resonated with her view 
of education as a human 
right, especially through 
the lens of her identity as a 
Syrian-American and her 
experience working with 
Syrian refugees.

“To 
ask 
elementary 

schoolers, ‘what do you 
want to do?’ and for them 
to say ‘well, what can I do? 
There’s nothing for me’ — 
that’s really why I feel very 
passionately about Books 
Not Bombs and why I think 
it’s so important to give this 
opportunity to those who 
really need it,” she said.

She said she felt the 

University has the potential 
to set an example for other 
public universities around 
the country.

“I think if (Books Not 

Bombs) is a success at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

that will just galvanize 
other students at other 
universities to push for 
the same thing on their 
campuses,” Khoja said.

Khoja also emphasized 

the 
importance 
of 
the 

apolitical nature of the 
campaign.

“Education is a human 

right, and so in a context 
of war where numerous 
crimes against humanity 
and war crimes are being 
carried out, education is 
really oftentimes the first 
thing to be attacked,” she 
said. “Because education 
is all about empowering 
people in communities, it’s 
important for a campaign 
like this to remain apolitical, 
so all communities in Syria 
can benefit from something 
like this, regardless of their 
ethnicity, regardless of their 
religion, of their sexual 
orientation.”

a concentration of wealth with a 
select few people who control all 
of the policies and we don’t really 
talk about class in America. Like, 
everyone is middle-class, you hear 
it in political rhetoric, we avoid 
class, and I feel like it’s time to 
give it the attention it deserves.”

Lang said, when he was in 

college, there were academic 
conversations 
on 
racial 
and 

gender inequality, due to the 
movements surrounding them, 
but socioeconomic inequity was 
not talked about in the same 
fashion.

“I think that’s primarily due 

to the civil rights movements 
and primarily also due to the 
women’s movement of the late 
‘60s and early ‘70s,” he said. “So 
that was on the agenda, race and 
gender inequality, which were 
important topics at the time. But 
social class — or socioeconomic 
status as it’s called by some, I like 
to call it social class — wasn’t on 
the higher education agenda. 

Of course it was talked about 
in different departments, but it 
wasn’t a focus.”

However, Lang said he thinks 

the current election, among other 
personal experiences and issues 
important to students related to 
the political environment over 
the past few years, has piqued 
students’ interest on the topic of 
social class.

“I think the interest in social 

class 
studies 
relates 
to 
the 

political environment that we’ve 
seen, the political debates from 
both Republicans and Democrats, 
students’ lives as they’ve lived 
in different social classes before 
they’ve come here,” Lang said. 
“A lot of students who are here 
now grew up during the recession 
and 
they’ve 
probably 
heard 

a lot of different interesting 
conversations at home, stresses 
and strains, even that middle 
class 
parents 
and 
families 

experienced.”

Schandevel said she thought 

Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders’ 
(I–Vt.) 

speeches during his campaign 
in the Democratic primary that 
highlighted low corporate taxes 

and the economic power of Wall 
Street helped spark conversations 
on 
social 
class 
inequality. 

Additionally, she noted that the 
support Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump receives 
from working-class Americans 
continues to bring the issues in 
the political sphere.

“People have been kind of 

honing in on the demographic 
and trying to figure them out,” 
Schandevel said. “There are a lot 
of subliminal conversations about 
class that aren’t explicitly about 
class.”

So far, Schandevel said, student 

responses 
for 
her 
program 

have been generally positive. 
LSA 
Student 
Government 
is 

supporting the idea as well, and 
is sending out a survey next week 
to gauge interest in the discipline.

Schandevel said she and the 

team of other students working 
to create the major have primarily 
been meeting with faculty to 
discuss the new major this 
semester. Next semester, the team 
plans to focus on independent 
studies looking into the feasibility 
of the new curriculum.

“Three of us on the team are 

doing 
an 
independent 
study 

with our mentor at the School 
of Social Work, who is giving 
us credit to develop a proposal 
for the course, the capstone 
and then the proposal itself and 
throughout that process we’ll be 
working with faculty from across 
departments to develop these 
things,” Schandevel said. We’re 
going to write a letter and have 
faculty members sign it and so 
when we take it to the curriculum 
committee it’s a little bit more 
compelling.”

Ideally, Schandevel said the 

group would get a pilot course 
implemented by next year, which 
students in it would then evaluate 
at the end. She said they will 
conduct focus groups to see what 
the interest for a program is like 
to gain empirical data, and to 
determine if they have enough 
faculty support to introduce the 
proposal 
for 
implementation 

around 2018 or 2019.

Barry Checkoway, professor 

of social work and Schandevel’s 
mentor, said he met her after he 
wrote a “fan letter” to Schandevel 

for her column in The Michigan 
Daily on her initial impressions of 
social class at the University as a 
freshman.

The two have been discussing 

social class for the past year, and 
he supported the idea for the 
new program when she began 
speaking to him about it.

“I thought that social class 

is among the most important 
forces in American society, that 
there are almost no courses at the 
University of Michigan that focus 
on social class, and that if the 
University of Michigan is trying 
to recruit lower-income, first 
generation students, that there’s 
need for a course or courses that 
are responsive to them,” he said.

The program, according to 

the group, would potentially 
be housed in the Sociology 
Department. Lang said he thinks 
the Sociology Department would 
be a logical place for the program, 
though he said there has been 
discussion about housing it in the 
American Studies Department, 
too, or other departments.

“Historically, 
sociology 

has 
always 
studied 
social 

stratification and social class has 
always been part of that,” he said.

While it may be housed in 

the 
Sociology 
Department, 

Schandevel said ideally students 
could take related classes in 
any department because of the 
program’s 
interdisciplinary 

nature, noting many existing 
classes that touch on social class 
could be incorporated into the 
potential program. This would 
mean only an introductory course 
and a capstone project would 
have to be created to tie the 
disciplinary together.

Overall, Schandevel said she 

hopes the major can change 
students’ views on social class 
by studying the issue with more 
nuance.

“I grew up in a working-class 

background so I already have 
thought about these things and 
I want this to be available to 
students who haven’t thought 
about class in this way, so maybe 
students from an upper-middle 
class 
background 
could 
take 

these courses and go through this 
program and see the world in a 
different way,” she said.

Black people differently.

In 
this 
study, 
Assari 

ultimately 
found 
that 
while 

negative perceptions of both 
neighborhood safety and quality 
predict mortality, these factors 
are better predictive of mortality 
for white people than Black 
people.

Similar research has been 

conducted by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
which found that social, physical 
and economic characteristics of 
neighborhoods are increasingly 
recognized as having short- and 
long-term 
consequences 
for 

residents’ lifespan.

Assari noted that there are 

social 
factors 
contributing 

to Black resilience in poorer 
conditions, such as a history of 
oppression. 

As an example, he cited Flint, 

noting that traditionally, the 
poorer areas of the city were 
occupied by low-income Black 
people, more and more white 
people have been moving into 
the area in recent years. Assari 
connected this to his findings, 
saying poor neighborhood quality 
would have more negative effects 
on the newer, white residents. 
This is in part due to traditional 
community 
support 
systems 

Black people tend to have that 
reduce 
their 
neighborhood’s 

effects.

“In the community there 

are sources of support from 
community 
members, 
from 

religion, from connection to God 
which are known to be stronger 
for Blacks,” Assari said.

Assari also noted that an 

individual’s comparison with 
social 
networks 
can 
also 

influence his or her perceptions 
of a neighborhood environment, 
saying it should be considered 
in crafting policy aimed at 

improving neighborhood safety 
and quality.

“There 
might 
be 
certain 

populations 
that 
are 
more 

vulnerable 
to 
the 
same 

exposure,” 
Assari 
said. 
“So 

policies which do not consider 
these group differences may 
fail to reduce health disparities 
because, if you just universally 
promote safety and just ignore 
that safety is going to have 
differential effects for different 
groups, you would not be able to 
predict what (these policies are) 
going to do.

Roshanak Mehdipanah, an 

assistant professor of health 
behavior and health education, 
was not directly involved in 
the 
study, 
but 
highlighted 

Assari’s findings in terms of 
her research, which primarily 
focuses on urban health equity.

Mehdipanah 
said 
both 

one’s 
physical 
environment 

— 
including 
infrastructure, 

housing, public transportation 
and physical access to healthy 
food sources — and social 
factors — such as access to 
clinics, employment programs 
or 
employment 
rates, 

education 
opportunities 
and 

demographics — all contribute 
to one’s perception of their 
neighborhood’s 
safety 
and 

quality.

She noted that in many poorer 

neighborhoods, there is a lack 
of investment that leads to 
physical neighborhood issues 
around safety, lack of resources 
and higher vacancy, all of which 
then contribute to social factors.

“Because 
there’s 
this 

disinvestment, 
resources 

begin dropping out too, so you 
don’t have as many outlets — 
for example, for employment 
opportunities — and so it’s 
this cycle of one contributing 
to the other in creating those 
inequalities between these types 
of neighborhoods,” Mehdipanah 
said.

NEIGHBORHOOD
From Page 1A

Over the past few days, both 

campaigns 
have 
stopped 
in 

Michigan in the last week left on 
the trail. In addition to Sanders’ 
rally, Trump stopped in Warren 
and Grand Rapids on Monday, his 
children Ivanka Trump and Donald 
Trump Jr. rallied in Troy and 
Detroit Wednesday and a Clinton 
rally is scheduled for Detroit on 
Friday.

Support in the state and at the 

University of Michigan has leaned 
in favor of Clinton for most of the 
general election season. The most 
recent 
RealClearPolitics 
polling 

average shows Clinton leading by 
6.4 points, and the most recent 
Michigan Daily election sample 
survey showed Clinton with 70.3 
percent of student support and 
Trump with 13.1 percent.

In his remarks, Sanders stressed 

the importance of voter turnout 
and encouraged students to vote, 
as young people traditionally have 
the lowest voter turnout rates. 
Additionally, he mentioned the 
accusations Democrats have made 
against the Republican National 
Committee for voter intimidation 
efforts targeting minorities.

“We’ve got to do everything we 

can to get more people voting, more 
people engaged in the process,” 
Sanders said. “I want this country to 
have a vibrant democracy.”

The Clinton campaign has also 

stressed the importance of higher 

education 
reform 
throughout 

the campaign season. After she 
accepted the nomination, Clinton 
and Sanders collaborated to update 
Clinton’s New College Compact 
to include tuition-free college for 
families earning less than $125,000 
per year. While the feasibility of 
these plans has been questioned by 
some institutions, higher education 
reform is a popular topic among 
students. 

On Wednesday, Sanders stressed 

that more jobs require a college 
degree than in previous decades, 
meaning higher education must 
be provided at little to no cost for 
maximum employment equity.

“When we talk about public 

education, it is not good enough 
to say kindergarten through 12th 
grade,” he said. “The world has 
changed and education has got to 
change. When we talk about public 
education, it must be making public 
colleges and universities tuition 
free.”

Western Michigan University 

sophomore Mara Minott said she 
plans to vote for Clinton because 
she believes she will best help all 
citizens.

“It was really a moving speech 

that makes you think about what is 
going on in our country,” she said. 
“For African Americans I think 
(Clinton is) for everybody and it’s 
not as if you are this color you get 
looked upon more highly than 
someone — it’s equal. For me, I was 
like, ‘I can be down with that.’ ”

In his remarks, Sanders also 

asked the audience to consider each 
candidate’s stance on the issues 

rather than consider the candidates 
as individuals.

Both candidates have relatively 

high unfavorability ratings, leading 
many voters to feel dissatisfied with 
their two major party options in the 
election.

“There are a lot of people in 

Michigan and a lot of people in 
Vermont who don’t like Donald 
Trump and who don’t like Hillary 
Clinton,” he said. “I am asking you to 
go beyond personality. Take a hard 
look at the issues that are impacting 
the middle class and impact this 
country, and on every issue you will 
find Hillary Clinton’s position far, 
far superior to Donald Trump’s.”

Paul Clements, WMU professor 

and 
6th 
district 
Democratic 

Congressional candidate, in his 
introduction of Sanders praised 
the senator to the crowd for the 
grassroots movement he created 
during the primary election.

“He inspired me, like I know he 

inspired many of us here today, with 
a vision of what government of, by 
and for the people needs to be in the 
21st century,” he said.

WMU junior Erin Huggett said 

Clements, who appeared popular 
among the crowd from cheers and 
numerous , earned her support due 
to his ability to further Sanders’ 
goals on more local level.

“I knew once Bernie wasn’t able 

to make the primary election goals 
that he had that I would want to vote 
for someone who he backed and 
supported for our local election,” 
she said. “I think as the revolution 
goes on, it is important that we look 
at the local elections.”

purple and greater and greater 
difficulty in states being able to 
find ways to work across partisan 
and even regional boundaries,” 
Rabe said.

To illustrate his point, Rabe 

cited the state of Washington, 
which in the 1980s and 1990s 
pushed forward numerous pieces 
of 
progressive 
environmental 

legislation but over the course of 
the last decade has struggled to 
pass any sort of bill. Currently, on 
the Washington ballot this year is 
a proposal known as Initiative 732 
that would place a tax on carbon 
and while the idea of a carbon tax 
has been adopted in countries like 
Canada, Rabe said he thinks the 
ballot proposal will be defeated.

“That will be defeated as we are 

at a point where there is almost an 
even split amongst the electorate,” 
Rabe said. “When you get this 
far into a campaign, the ‘no’ vote 
begins to take over. It is the first 
explicit test of whether or 
not that policy is credible in a 
larger system.”

Lisa 
Wozniak,

the 
Michigan 
League 

of 
Conservation 
Voters, 

a 
nonpartisan

organization 
dedicated 
to 

safeguarding the state’s land, 
air and water, highlighted 
the current state of policy in 
Michigan. Wozniak said since 
2008, a significant amount of 
environmental legislation has 
been proposed in the state 
legislature.

Over the past few months, the 

Republican nominee has faced 
significant criticism on his attitude 
toward 
women. 
Last 
month, 

The Washington Post released a 
2005 tape of Trump in which he 
discussed touching women without 
their consent. Since the publication 
of the tape, multiple women have 
come forward to accuse Trump 
of sexually assaulting them. The 
Trump campaign has denied the 
women’s accounts.

However, 
in 
Troy, 
Ivanka 

Trump’s discussion of her father’s 
policies 
on 
women’s 
issues 

resonated for many in attendance, 
including a collection of local 
businesswomen 
who. 
attended 

the event. Michelle Fint, who is 
employed in the hotel industry and 
expressed support for Trump, said 
she was especially concerned about 
health benefits.

“My concern is primarily with 

women’s issues,” Fint said. “In 
particular, with the plight of 
single mothers. Some places have 
been forced to stop offering the 
same health benefits to those in 
that situation, which can really 
affect people’s future planning.”

Business issues were a frequent 

touchstone for Ivanka Trump, 
who also wove in concerns about 
child care and education, such as 
maternity leave — issues that she 
said are of particular concern for 
women in business.

“One of the areas that my 

father has felt strongly about is 
paid maternity leave,” Trump 
said, prompting a loud applause 
from the crowd. 

Despite 
the 
focus 
on 

women’s issues, some women in 
attendance, like Marian Sheridan, 

did not emphasize women’s issues 
as the most important issues of 
the election.

Prior to the event, Sheridan 

said she believed gender relations 
in the United States were already 
positive.

“We already have the best 

country in the world for gender 
relations,” Sheridan said. “I don’t 
see that as something that needs 
tinkering. I believe that it’s an 
example of how Democrats try to 
find issues with things.”

In her remarks, Ivanka Trump 

also 
discussed 
her 
father’s 

educational plan, in particular 
his proposal for the allocation 
of grants to the states to address 
educational standards, and his 
support for charter and magnet 
schools.

“My 
father 
will 
repeal 

Common 
Core 
when 
he 
is 

president,” Trump said. “He 
has a plan to provide grants 
to the states so that they can 
best address the needs of their 
schools. Additionally, he believes 
in school choice for students … 
There should be no one-size-fits-
all approach.”

Trump concluded the event by 

reaffirming her confidence in her 
father’s abilities to call upon his 
business leadership skills during 
his time in office, if elected.

“My father is someone who 

swings for the fences, but also 
executes,” Trump said. “And 
what you can count on is that he 
is not beholden to anyone but the 
American people.”

Some supporters also gathered 

outside of the event to express 
their sentiments about Trump.

FROM THE DAILY

Extending term limits favors democracy
N

ext week, Ann Arbor residents will vote on a controversial ballot 
proposal to extend the term of office for Ann Arbor mayor and 
City Council members from two years to four years. If approved, 

City Council elections would be held at the same time as general elections, 
meaning Ann Arbor will see increased voter turnout for City Council 
elections, candidates who will take their positions more seriously and council 
members who will be able to take on larger projects that will have lasting 
benefits for the city. For these reasons, The Michigan Daily endorses the 
ballot proposal to extend city officials’ term limits to four years. However, 
this ballot proposal doesn’t get at the fundamental problem that primaries 
are held in August, resulting in a very small group of voters going to the 
polls to decide who even has the opportunity to run. Though extending term 
limits is a step toward a more democratic Ann Arbor, it is not an ultimate fix.

Proponents 
of 
the 
ballot 

proposal argue that extending 
the term limit to four years will 
increase voter turnout. This 
is a much needed effort: Ann 
Arbor’s last odd-year election in 
2015 garnered an unsurprisingly 
paltry 8.7 percent voter turnout, 
allowing a relatively small group 
of highly invested voters an 
outsized voice over the majority 
of city residents. However, voter 
turnout more than triples for 
even-year general elections that 
coincide with larger national and 
state-wide contests. Increasing 
the city officials’ term limit 
from two to four years would 
allow local elections to occur 
concurrently with larger ones 
and draw significantly more 
constituents to the polls, ensuring 
the local government responds 
to the wants of the broader 
population rather than small 
groups of highly invested voters.

At the University of Michigan 

level, 
even-year 
elections 

would likely increase student 
input because more students 
vote during larger state and 
national elections. Input from 
diverse 
populations 
helps 

ensure that local government 
is 
truly 
representative 
and 

accountable 
for 
its 
diverse 

groups of constituents. Though 
some argue that those who do 
show up to vote are voters who 
are well-educated in city issues, 
with longer terms, we hope to 
see candidates who are more 
serious 
about 
disseminating 

information 
about 
their 

campaigns. Ideally, this will 
not only increase voter turnout, 
but also bring those voters to 
the ballot with more adequate 
information 
to 
make 
an 

educated vote for city officials. 

In 
addition, 
four-year 

terms would likely amplify 
the productivity of elected 

city officials while in office. 
Holding elections every two 
years forces officials to divert 
valuable 
time 
away 
from 

governing 
to 
campaigning. 

Expanding 
terms 
allows 

council 
members 
to 
focus 

energy on the types of long-
term 
projects 
critical 
to 

developing cities such as Ann 
Arbor. Furthermore, it gives 
city officials time to gain a 
more nuanced understanding 
of the city’s constituents and 
issues.

Those opposing the proposal 

argue two-year terms actually 
enforce more accountability 
of elected officials — running 
for 
re-election 
means 

officials must engage with 
constituents more frequently, 
and 
potentially 
changing 

seats allows voters to voice 
their concerns about quickly 
changing local events more 
frequently. Though two-year 
terms do force candidates to 
critically engage with voters 
during election cycles, the small 
voter pool in odd-year elections 
reduces accountability to the 
broader population. This also 
encourages more pandering 
to single-issue voters and less 
independence for city officials 
to actually accomplish their 
initiatives for the city.

However, 
increasing 
the 

term 
limit 
is 
no 
panacea. 

While increasing city officials’ 
term 
limits 
may 
increase 

accountability 
and 
enhance 

elected 
representatives’ 

productivity, Ann Arbor still 
must make significant strides 
toward 
a 
more 
democratic 

election 
process. 
Council 

primaries occur in August, 
meaning a very small group of 
voters (and even fewer students) 
decides on the candidate pool 
before 
the 
actual 
election 

in 
November. 
The 
current 

partisan primary system also 
urges candidates to run under 
a party banner. The fact that no 
Republicans have held elected 
office in Ann Arbor in the past 
10 years — and exceedingly 
few even run — exacerbates 
the partisan primary system’s 
stifling of choice. 

Moreover, four-year terms 

may 
prompt 
more 
voter 

participation because a four-
year term in office carries 
greater 
weight. 
However, 

extending terms to four years 
may encourage straight-ticket 
voting, as voters associate local 
officials with candidates at the 
top of the party’s ticket. This 
may lessen serious engagement 
with local candidates and make 
local 
issues 
unnecessarily 

partisan. In fact, Ann Arbor 
is one of the only cities in 
Michigan that still relies on 
partisanship in local elections 
and governance. Many local 
governments 
have 
abolished 

partisan elections to promote 
meaningful engagement with 
local issues rather than voting 
for 
whichever 
candidate 
is 

associated with a preferred 
gubernatorial or presidential 
candidate. Ditching the partisan 
primary system in addition 
to 
expanding 
terms 
might 

significantly 
improve 
Ann 

Arbor’s democratic process.

Expanding 
term 
limits 

from two to four years will 
significantly 
improve 
voter 

turnout across diverse segments 
of 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
population 

and increase elected officials’ 
productivity on complex issues. 
Though much work remains to be 
done on improving the primary 
system, 
the 
Daily 
believes 

expanded term limits will help 
significantly 
strengthen 
Ann 

Arbor’s democratic process.

The Flint-Standing Rock connection

ANU ROY-CHAUDHURY | COLUMN

H

istory, 
unfortunately, 

seems to repeat itself. 
When we say this, we 

really mean that we never learn 
from our mistakes. Last week, 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
held a policy talk on Flint’s water 
crisis. A panel of community 
leaders and a member 
of the governor’s task 
force discussed the 
array 
of 
injustices 

Flint 
experienced 

and 
continues 

to 
experience. 
A 

member of the panel, 
E. Hill De Loney, the 
executive 
director 

of the Flint Odyssey 
House 
Health 

Awareness 
Center, 

said something that’s 
stuck with me the 
past few days: “There’s not a 
race problem in America. There 
is, however, a racism problem in 
America.”

The United States prides 

itself on a unique tapestry of 
cultures and backgrounds and a 
sense of equality tying them all 
together. As much as we want 
to believe this is an accurate 
portrayal of the country, it isn’t 
— and we all know it. Embedded 
inequalities based on race, 
ethnicity and socioeconomic 
status are institutionalized and 
systematic. Minorities in the 
country are among the poorest 
populations. The danger of 
not 
addressing 
inequalities 

is that people in privileged 
positions may take advantage 
of such inequalities. Just as 
we saw discrimination that 
intertwined people and the 
environment in the Flint crisis, 
we see it again in the hills of 
North Dakota.

In American history classes, we 

learned, in a very peripheral way, 
about the historic discrimination 
of 
Native 
Americans, 

characterized by the systematic 
relocation of tribes westward and 
onto isolated reservations. This 
has led to the present 29.2 percent 
poverty rate of Native Americans, 
the highest of any racial group 
in the United States. The newly 
intensified 
situation 
at 
the 

Standing Rock Sioux Reservation 
is a testament to their enduring 
hardships 
and 
yet 
another 

example 
of 
environmental 

racism in the United States. 
Environmental justice is defined 
as 
“the 
fair 
treatment 
and 

meaningful involvement of all 
people regardless of race, color, 
national origin, or income, with 
respect 
to 
the 
development, 

implementation, 
and 

enforcement of environmental 
laws, regulations, and policies.” 
In Flint, this type of justice was 
non-existent. In Standing Rock, it 
still is nowhere to be found.

The Sioux are part of a 

Native American tribe living in 

the Standing Rock Reservation 
in 
North 
Dakota. 
Energy 

Transfers Partners, a natural 
gas company, is constructing 
the Dakota Access Pipeline, 
an underground pipeline near 
sacred Sioux land. The $3.8 
billion pipeline would transfer 

massive amounts of 
oil between states in 
a supposedly safer 
way. However, the 
pipeline 
threatens 

tribal 
rights 
as 

construction is near 
their 
reservation 

and sacred burial 
sites. The pipeline 
also 
poses 
the 

threat 
of 
water 

contamination to the 
Sioux people living 
on and near the land. 

State officials have assured the 
environmental safety of the 
pipeline. However, there have 
been 220 pipeline spills in 2016 
alone, as well as one in North 
Dakota just three months ago, 
and a pipeline explosion in 
Alabama this week. The Sioux 
people 
and 
environmental 

activists have been protesting 
the finishing of this pipeline 
for the past five months, yet 
there has been no agreement 
made to protect their cultural 
and environmental rights.

Just 
this 
weekend, 
the 

situation intensified as police 
arrested at least 142 protesters 
and forced others out of land 
they had occupied in protest. 
The sad irony of this situation 
is that it only perpetuates the 
racial injustice Native Americans 
have faced since Christopher 
Columbus arrived in America. 
The limited land that tribes are 
now entitled to on reservations, 
which was allocated by the 
federal government to begin 
with, is again threatened. I mean, 
what century are we in? The same 
history lesson we learned about 
Anglo-Saxon colonists pushing 
tribes westward and taking their 
land is reminiscent of what is 
happening now. An effort to make 
money and expand a business is 
valued over the environmental 
concerns of a people and their 
culture — more specifically, the 
concerns of a minority group. 
It sounds unfair doesn’t it? To 
take advantage of an already 
disadvantaged 
group? 
Well, 

history shows it happens often.

Racism 
intertwined 
with 

environment is at the heart of 
both situations. The outright 
disregard for the people of Flint 
due to their races and their 
economic statuses resulted in 
a health crisis that to this day 
has not been solved. A question 
commonly posed to illustrate 
the environmental injustice of 
the city is this: Would this have 
happened in a predominantly 
white or subsequently richer 

city? Probably not. The delay 
in government action and the 
neglect 
officials 
showed 
for 

Flint’s concerns would not have 
occurred 50 miles down the 
road in Ann Arbor. At Standing 
Rock, we can ask a similar 
question: Would an oil pipeline 
be constructed near or under a 
cemetery or church in Ann Arbor 
or near the city at all? I think you 
know the answer.

Similar to Flint, the people 

of Standing Rock, who would 
actually live with this pipeline, 
were barely consulted — if at 
all — when it came to the major 
project. According to Seattle 
Times reporter Lynda Mapes, 
the tribe has said it was not 
adequately involved in the 
construction 
decisions 
and 

were not even consulted until 
after the construction started. 
In a press release last month, 
the Sioux people expressed 
that “the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers did not hold 
meaningful consultation with 
our Tribe before approving 
construction of this pipeline. 
They did not conduct a survey 
of cultural resources.” This 
highlights a huge flaw in U.S. 
policy 
making. 
Entering 
a 

community, whether to fix 
a problem or unknowingly 
create one, is dangerous when 
you have no understanding or 
consideration of the people 
who live there.

A solidarity movement on 

Facebook 
has 
drawn 
more 

attention and hopefully advocacy 
for 
the 
environmental 
and 

cultural rights at stake. Situations 
like the one in North Dakota 
have the power to shape future 
relationships 
between 
groups 

and policies on environmental 
protection. The current disregard 
for and lack of true consultation 
with the people of Standing Rock 
cannot be tolerated any longer.

A community’s right to a safe 

environment is a human right, 
as is cultural respect. Both are 
at risk at Standing Rock. The 
United States has a responsibility 
to take care of our own, yet we 
allow the people who have the 
fewest economic resources to 
be taken advantage of. There 
must be a compromise between 
the Sioux Tribe and Energy 
Transfers Partners that doesn’t 
take advantage of the ingrained 
inequalities of a minority. By 
playing 
on 
inequalities 
we 

perpetuate them. If we don’t 
change something now, if we 
don’t start a more understanding 
and 
compassionate 
approach 

to policy, then we run the risk 
of letting history repeat itself. 
Standing Rock is a test for the 
country — and I know we can do 
better than this.

JOE GUITH | OP-ED

T

ake chances. Take the 
job other people don’t 
want and make a success 

out of it. Get your hands dirty. 
Listen to those who can mentor 
you and save you from repeating 
mistakes made by others.

These are the lessons I 

learned 
while 
earning 
my 

MBA at the Ross School of 
Business that have served me 
well through the turns of my 
20-year career in the food 
service, 
consumer 
products, 

technology and retail arenas 
with companies including The 
Coca-Cola Company, KFC, Intel 
and, today, Cinnabon.

One of the key moments of 

insight came for me during my 
MBA program when I founded 
Mcorp, 
an 
internationally 

focused 
volunteer 
student 

organization. At the time, I 
was simply looking for a way 
to spend the last Spring Break 
of my student career. So, I 
decided to build a new student 
organization 
and 
organize 

a volunteer trip to Belize. I 
wanted to unite our classes 
while raising awareness around 
social responsibility. I pitched 
my idea to the administration 
and was funded $5,500 to get 
the operation off the ground. 
Much to my surprise, more 
than 20 people committed 
and joined me for a week of 
philanthropy, self-growth and 
team building.

Moments like this can be the 

building blocks of your career. 
The 
positive 
response 
to 

Mcorp showed me that it pays 
to try something different and 
to put yourself out there with 
your ideas. Don’t count on an 
organization to map out your 
career. Chart your own path.

Experiences like Mcorp are 

why I decided to take control 
of my career, starting with 
pursuing an MBA. Talent and 
skill separate us from our peers, 
but learning and implementing 
the principles of leadership 
move us to a higher plane in 
our careers and beyond typical 
achievements.

I took the lessons from 

Mcorp and other experiences 
with me as I worked at Coca-
Cola as the vice president of 
global business development 
and later as the vice president 
of 
vending 
operations 
for 

North America. Trust me, no 
one was champing at the bit 
to run the vending business. 
It was tedious and could easily 
have become the company’s 
dinosaur 
business 
without 

some 
TLC 
and 
focus 
on 

problem solving by investing 
in new technology. What most 
saw as daunting, I saw as an 
opportunity. We threw out 
the familiar approaches and 
reversed 
double-digit 
sales 

declines and franchise losses. 
The result propelled my career 

onto an executive track.

My MBA experience also 

greatly informed me about 
how to build a team. Too often 
organizations get caught in 
the habit of hiring someone 
with the same experience and 
skills for a given role without 
considering 
someone 
with 

different industry experience 
or from a larger operation. 
As president of Cinnabon, 
I am constantly looking to 
improve the organization by 
hiring people outside the food 
service arena with a fresh 
perspective.

Embracing new opportunities, 

reevaluating existing ones and 
recognizing the value of diverse 
teams has defined my career. 
My MBA experience reinforced 
these instincts by showing me 
the importance of teamwork 
and encouraging new ideas and 
taking chances. I want people 
willing to put themselves and 
their ideas “out there.”

So forge your own path, 

take on challenges that others 
won’t, recognize the strength of 
succeeding as a team and you’ll 
put yourself in a position to 
meet your current career goals 
and hit goals you haven’t even 
dreamed of yet.

Joe Guith is the President of 

Cinnabon and an alum of the Ross 

Schoool of Business.


HAPPY THURSDAY!

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Eddie McDoom has 12 carries as a wide receiver for Michigan this year.
McDoom relishes 
role in ‘M’ offense

Eddie McDoom knew they 

were saying his name, but he had 
to process it for a moment first.

The freshman receiver with 

a name befitting a comic book 
hero had never heard a crowd 
yell “dooooom” before. Not in 
high school, not growing up, not 
until 109,000 did it at Michigan 
Stadium on Sept. 3.

“At first it sounds like ‘Boo,’ ” 

McDoom said Tuesday. “When 
I’m putting two and two 
together, I’m like, it’s ‘Dooom,’ 
but it sounds like ‘Boo.’ ”

The truth is, Michigan’s 

first-year 
standout 
hasn’t 

given anyone a reason to boo. 
Through eight games, McDoom 
has already piled up 12 carries 
as a receiver. He has taken them 
for 148 yards and added four 
catches for 53 yards.

The bulk of those yards 

have come via the jet sweep, a 
reverse or a play 
designed to look 
like sweep but 
evolving 
into 

something else. 
McDoom 
said 

his favorite so 
far was a reverse 
he 
ran 
with 

fifth-year senior 
receiver 
Jehu 

Chesson 
last 

week 
against 

Michigan State, but he has also 
run a play where he mimicked a 
sweep, only to go out for a pass.

McDoom said that when he 

arrived on campus this summer 
he didn’t realize he would be 
so involved so soon. It had 
been just months since he was 
playing at West Orange High 
School in Winter Garden, Fla.

But 
Michigan 
offensive 

coordinator Tim Drevno saw 
potential in McDoom right away.

“He’s very fast,” Drevno said 

Wednesday. “Doesn’t say much. 
Unbelievable worker. You put 
him out there, he’ll just keep 
going and going and going. He’s 
a playmaker, and I knew it when 
he walked in the doors, just 
during training camp, you could 
see he had the speed, he had the 
skillset that you really like in a 
football player.”

The result has been an 

impact larger than might have 
been expected from a freshman 
with just 16 touches. When 
McDoom comes into a game, 
defenses have to prepare for 
him to get the ball. He said that 
the variations off the sweep 
were installed in the beginning, 
which makes sense, because 
otherwise defenses could key in 
on stopping the rush to the edge.

But even if defenses did know 

what was coming, it would be no 

guarantee they could stop him. 
McDoom 
considers 
himself 

the fastest player on the team, 
though he has yet to race any 
of the expected challengers. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
receiver 

Jehu Chesson has long been 
considered the leader, but when 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
was asked if McDoom was as 
fast as Chesson, he posited 
another option.

“How is (redshirt sophomore 

linebacker Jabrill) Peppers not 
the fastest guy on the team?” he 
wondered.

As a competitor, it’s unlikely 

McDoom would ever outright 
concede the title of fastest player 
willingly. But on Tuesday, he 
went a step further than non-
concession.

“Jabrill is fast,” McDoom 

said. “But I feel like I can take 
him.”

As fast as McDoom is, he has 

the confidence to match. He 
declared his intentions to have 

a 
breakout 

season 
next 

year 
(“I’m 

pretty sure I’m 
going to blow 
up,” he said), 
and with what 
he’s 
shown 

already, 
the 

possibility 
is 
hard 
to 

dispute. But he 
stops short of 

taking full credit for all he has 
accomplished.

When asked about his role as 

the go-to jet sweeper, McDoom 
deflected.

“It’s not really mine,” he 

said. “I just, I don’t know, I just 
show the speed. Show I’m the 
fastest guy here, that’s how I’m 
always going to think. Speed is 
my thing. So when they give it 
to me, I try to make the most 
of it.”

Going forward, Drevno said, 

there are “lots” more things 
Michigan can do out of the 
jet sweep package, both with 
McDoom 
and 
with 
others. 

They’re always looking to get 
more dynamic, he said, and with 
McDoom, dynamic seems to be 
the norm.

But Drevno was also sure 

to clarify that his freshman 
receiver could do more than 
sweeps. That speed lends itself 
well to deep balls, too.

Seeing deep balls thrown his 

way seems to fit with McDoom’s 
plan for a breakout 2017, but for 
now, the freshman is enjoying 
every sweep, reverse or decoy 
play thrown his way.

“I didn’t know I was going 

to make this much of a splash,” 
McDoom said. “I’m just taking 
every day as a gift. I’m just going 
with it.”

D-Line gears up for home stretch

At 
this 
time 
last 
year, 

Michigan defensive line coach 
Greg Mattison had to deal with 
injuries on a line that had a lot of 
talent but questionable depth.

With Bryan Mone out all of 

last season with a broken leg 
and Ryan Glasgow sidelined 
mid-season with a torn pectoral 
muscle, 
Mattison 
had 
to 

scramble to find capable bodies 
to fill run gaps. Those problems 
became 
paramount 
last 

November, when running backs 
like Indiana’s Jordan Howard 
and Ohio State’s Ezekiel Elliott 
— both of whom are now starting 
in the NFL — ran roughshod 
over the Wolverines.

A year later, though, Mattison’s 

biggest worry was whether his 
beloved Chicago Cubs would win 
Game 7 of the World Series on 
Wednesday night.

“I don’t want to jinx them,” 

Mattison said. “I just know last 
night, in the seventh inning, 
my wife tried to talk to me and 
I wouldn’t speak to her. ‘Let me 
concentrate on this.’ ”

Stress 
levels 
have 
been 

through the roof for Cubs fans 
the past few weeks, but Mattison 
now has plenty of time to join 
them — his work life couldn’t be 
going much better.

In recent terms, Michigan’s 

defensive line is as healthy as 
it has ever been this late in the 
season. Other than Mone, who 
is still practicing but has battled 
through nagging injuries all 
year, the Wolverines’ four-man 
line has a completely healthy 
two-deep rotation.

Those eight players make 

up what might be the best 
defensive line in the country, 
accounting for 33 tackles for loss 
(for perspective, that’s as many 
as Iowa’s entire defense). More 
strikingly, there often appears to 
be no noticeable dropoff from the 
starters to the backups. Redshirt 
sophomore 
Chase 
Winovich 

leads the defensive line in tackles, 
and redshirt junior Maurice 
Hurst leads it in tackles for loss, 
despite 
both 
playing 
mostly 

second-team snaps.

Given the injury struggles 

Michigan has faced both last 

year and in years past, Mattison 
is very pleased not to have to 
worry about his position group’s 
health again.

“It’s as well as can be 

expected,” he said. “These kids 
are very, very physical football 
players, and they’ve gone against 
some big offensive linemen, 
some physical offensive linemen. 
Having the ability to rotate them 
has allowed for them not to have 
60 or 70 reps. Getting off on 
third down has allowed us not to 
have to play 10, 12 extra reps.”

The line has been so effective 

that none of the players had to 
overexert themselves through 
the first seven games of the 
season. Playing Michigan State 
last Saturday was one of the 
first times they were tested, as 
Spartan running back LJ Scott 
did some damage with 139 yards 
and a touchdown.

By the end of the game, 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
saw a few cracks in his 
defense’s armor.

“I do feel we have some things 

that we can address and coach and 
be better at,” he said. “I thought 

we got a little tired up front. … 
Throughout the team, it was good 
for our defense to be tested.”

According to Mattison, the 

defensive linemen didn’t need 
to be told that. They felt like 
stopping 
the 
running 
game 

was their responsibility, and 
they recognized that they were 
missing tackles and playing too 
high up front.

As it works to correct those 

mistakes, the defensive line is 
showing that its late-season 
freshness is more than just a 
physical advantage.

“Mentally 
and 
physically,” 

Mattison said. “They (all) come 
to meetings every day ready to go. 
They all practice with the kind 
of intensity that we want, the 
alertness we want. It’s a special 
group. … They love playing 
together, they have respect for 
each other. They know the bar’s 
very high for them.

“Some people, when people 

gain a few yards every once 
in a while, they’d say, ‘Ah, no 
big deal.’ This group takes it to 
heart, and that’s what I think 
separates them.”

Wolverines set for exhibition against Wayne State

With 
all 
the 
high-profile 

events in which the Michigan 
women’s basketball team has 
participated 
this preseason 
— the Jumpman 
uniform 
unveiling, 
the 

kids 
clinic 

and the open-
practice 3-point 
shootout 
— 

it is easy to 
forget that the 
Wolverines 
have to yet to 
play a game.

That will change Thursday 

night 
when 
Michigan 
hosts 

Wayne State, a Division II team, 
in an exhibition contest. The 
game will be a rematch of the 
Wolverines’ 2013 season opener, 
when 
Michigan 
topped 
the 

Warriors, 81-55.

And with the season around 

the corner, excitement has built.

“I’m pretty thrilled with how 

practices have been going,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “A lot of ups and downs 
with the beginning of the season, 
but the enthusiasm and the 
excitement is really high.”

On 
paper, 
Wayne 
State 

appears to pose little threat to 
Michigan. The Warriors lost six 
letterwinners from their squad 
that finished 12-16 last year and 
the Great Lakes Intercollegiate 
Athletics Conference’s preseason 

rankings 
have 
Wayne 
State 

finishing sixth out of eight teams 
this season.

The 
Warriors 
are 
not 

completely 
devoid 
of 

playmakers, 
though. 

Guard 

Shannon 
Wilson returns 
this year after 
averaging 
13.6 

points 
and 

four 
rebounds 

in 
2015-16. 

Transfer 
guard 
Ja’Nee 

Williams came to Wayne State 
after 
averaging 
10.9 
points 

last year on an IUPUI team 
that tallied a 29-2 record. 

Wilson and Williams will test a 
Wolverine defense that Barnes 
Arico believes has improved 
from last year.

Thursday’s 

contest 
will 

also 
give 

Michigan 
a 

chance to show 
off its offensive 
weapons, 
the 
most 

noteworthy 
being 
junior 

guard Katelynn 
Flaherty.

Flaherty 

was 
the 

Wolverines’ 
leading 
scorer 

last 
season, 
accumulating 

22.1 
points 
per 
game 
and 

scoring at least 10 points in 

34 of 35 contests. Already this 
season, she defeated senior 
guard Duncan Robinson of 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team in a three-point shooting 
contest. Flaherty made 21 shots 
compared to Robinson’s 20.

“I know he’s a great shooter,” 

Flaherty said of Robinson. “I 
think it was very exciting. I think 
I made every shot up until the 
last ones. It was great to have a 
good atmosphere.”

Thursday will also be the first 

in-game action for freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick.

She 
enters 
this 
season 

with high expectations after 
averaging 
40.5 
points 
for 

Benton Harbor High School 
last year, including a 72-point 
performance in a playoff game, 

a Michigan state record.

“We 
have 
an 
incredible 

freshman in Kysre Gonderzick,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She was 
Miss Basketball in the state of 
Michigan. We now can go 8 or 9 
deep without losing a beat.”

While Wayne State shouldn’t 

pose much of a threat to 
Michigan — barring a stunning 
upset — the Wolverines are 
just excited to finally play an 
actual basketball game against 
another team.

“Preseason 
becomes 
long, 

especially with how hard we go 
every day,” Flaherty said. “You 
just have to realize that there’s a 
light at the end of the tunnel and 
it’s all going to pay off. I think 
we’re just really excited knowing 
how well we can do this year.”

Breaking down the stats 
behind Michigan’s slump

Seven games into the season 

last year, the Michigan hockey 
team was working with a 5-1-1 
record. It was an early indicator 
of the potential it had that would 
lead it all the way to the NCAA 
Midwest Regional Final. The 
Wolverines hadn’t even created 
their lethal first line consisting 
of forwards Tyler Motte, Kyle 
Connor and J.T. Compher, but 
they still managed to rack up five 
wins in their first seven games.

This season, though, Michigan 

is off to a slower start.

The No. 17 Wolverines sit at 

3-3-1 roughly a fifth of the way 
into their season. They have 
three losses at the hands of 
Union (three weeks ago) and 
Vermont and Dartmouth (this 
past weekend).

In 
certain 
areas 
of 

Michigan’s stats so far, the 
reasons for these losses are 
evident. The Wolverines have 
totaled just 156 shots so far this 
season, while their opponents 
have generated 256. In the same 
span last year, they had won the 
shots battle, 285-195.

They’ve totaled 42 penalties 

in seven games, with an average 
of 6 per game — 50 percent more 
than early in last year. However, 
their opponents combined have 
scored just 36. And for two of 
these three losses, Michigan 
wasn’t able to hang onto an early 
lead to clinch a win.

These traits have been clear 

since the season opener against 
Union, and they were still 
present in the Wolverines’ most 
recent game. Against the Big 
Green, Michigan ended the game 
trailing by 11 shots. And despite 
tying up the game in the second 

period, the Wolverines allowed 
a late Dartmouth goal, securing 
their third loss of the season.

“We just kind 

of 
said 
we’ve 

done 
way 
too 

much 
talking 

this year and not 
enough showing 
it on the ice and 
showing it in our 
play,” said senior 
defenseman 
Nolan De Jong. 
 

“I think, like I 
said, we did a 
really good job. 
We did. Especially in that first 
play coming out and showing that 
we had something to prove, and 
we obviously couldn’t maintain 
that style of play throughout the 
entire game.

But we did come out with some 

excitement and we did come out 
like we had something to prove. 
So, like I said, it wasn’t the entire 
60 minutes like we needed, but it 
was a good sign going forward.”

Despite 
these 
problem 

areas, 
though, 
Michigan 
is 

capitalizing on its silver linings. 
The Wolverines’ goaltending, 
for example, boasts a .934 save 
percentage overall, much better 
than their opponents’ .885 and 
their own .882 from the first 
seven games of last season. All 
three Michigan goaltenders that 
have seen action this season have 
above a .900 save percentage, 
with a collective total of 239 
saves this season.

Penalty kills have also been 

a high point for the Wolverines 
this year. Just this past weekend, 
senior 
forwards 
Alex 
Kile 

and Max Shuart both found 
themselves 
in 
the 
penalty 

box during the second period 
against the Big Green. Even 

though Dartmouth had a two-
man advantage, it wasn’t able to 
capitalize. In these tight plays, 

the 
Wolverines 

have shown that 
they can secure 
the defense.

Michigan has 

a lot it needs 
to work on, but 
it’s not without 
its 
strengths. 

And 
since 
the 

Wolverines have 
acknowledged 
their 
downfalls 

early this season, 

it gives them a chance to fix their 
mistakes and capitalize on their 
positives before the bigger games 
roll around later in the season.

Three independent game developers talk 
stress, inspiration and passion for their craft

Cooper Riehl wants to make video games.
He has wanted to since middle school, when he 

played GameCube and RuneScape and discovered 
how to program text adventures onto his TI-85 cal-
culator.

Now, he’s a senior at the School of Engineering, 

and he’s putting that dream into motion as a pro-
grammer and webmaster for Wolverine Soft, a stu-
dent-run organization dedicated to fostering game 
development talent.

“I would love to do it professionally,” Riehl said 

in a Skype interview with The Michigan Daily. “I 
haven’t decided what I want to do finally when I 
get out of college, but I would love to work at a big-
name studio or a small indie studio with a couple of 
friends, as long as we were making enough to sup-
port ourselves. It’s definitely a big passion of mine.”

For Riehl, making games is an opportunity to 

have a career as a software programmer in a field 
that brings people joy.

“I do think games are an art form, but for me 

it’s more about programming something exciting 
rather than some boring old system in a bank some-
where,” he said. “I like the idea of writing code to 
create something that people actually enjoy using 
rather than just another random application.”

He’s not the only one around campus who dreams 

of making video game development a career. Accord-
ing to Riehl, more than 80 new members signed up 
for Wolverine Soft this semester alone — the biggest 
uptick in membership since Riehl joined the club 
three years ago.

It’s not hard to understand why independent 

game development is currently such an appealing 

career venue for young programmers, artists and 
musicians, as both mainstream and game-indus-
try-specific journalists have brought monumental 
attention to indie success stories.

In 2012, Lissanne Pajot and James Swirsky’s 

acclaimed documentary “Indie Game: The Movie” 
told the story of four independent developers whose 
projects turned into landmark commercial and crit-
ical successes, simultaneously making each of them 
millions and skyrocketing them into avant-gardist 
wunderkind status among their industry peers. The 
New Yorker and The Atlantic have also published 
extensive profiles of developers Rami Ismail and 
Jonathan Blow, respectively, highlighting their 
near-overnight successes, their road-hitting indie 
hero lifestyle and their thorough dedication to their 
art.

INDIE GAMES
From Page 1B

More recently, the runaway 

success of Toby Fox’s “Undertale” 
has grabbed the attention of 
young 
game 
developers. 
A 

heartfelt, 
character-driven 

role-playing game with simple 
graphics and beautiful original 
music, “Undertale” was Fox’s 
very first video game (he had 
previously 
worked 
on 
free 

modifications for other games), 
developed in GameMaker: Studio 
using Kickstarter crowdfunding. 
His 
on-the-first-try 
breakout 

hit is one of the reasons aspiring 
developers like Riehl are so 
dedicated to indie success.

“That one (‘Undertale’) was 

huge for a lot of people, and I’m 
certainly included in that,” Riehl 
said. “The impressive part is that 
Toby Fox is just this one man. I 
mean, he had like a few people 
supporting him, but this small 
development team made this huge 
successful game that everyone 
has been talking about.”

It’s estimated by some sites 

that the 25-year-old Fox has 
made eight-figure profits from 
“Undertale.” 

But 
for 
most 
independent 

developers, it’s certainly not just 
about the money. As artists, indie 
developers are given the freedom 
to experiment and implement 
their creative visions exactly as 
they want to. They often work 
on their own schedules, and are 
given agency to choose exactly 
with whom they’d like to work.

According 
to 
Ye 
Feng, 
a 

developer at the new Shanghai-
based indie studio, Pixpil, there’s 
simply a lot to love about working 
as an indie developer.

“That’s too many to list,” he 

wrote in an email interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “Essentially 
everything you can imagine about 
doing your stuff rather than your 
boss’s.”

Pixpil is currently working 

on a post-apocalyptic action, 
role-playing 
game 
called 

“Eastward,” which has recently 
garned a ton of buzz on Twitter. 
They’re a team of eight, and 
a lone third-party investor is 
funding 
them 
independently. 

Their game is inspired by games 
like “The Legend of Zelda” and 
“Earthbound,” as well as Studio 
Ghibli’s unique visual animation 
style. They’re keeping details 
about the game’s plot under 
wraps.

“In 
‘Eastward,’ 
there’s 
a 

middle-age man (who) travels 
with a mystery white-haired 
teenage girl, but that’s all I can 
say for now,” Feng wrote. “Sorry.”

Eastward’s 
pixel 
art 
is 

haunting, stylized and uniquely 
animated and lit, and the beauty 
of its design has caught the 
attention of thousands of fans on 
Twitter. GIFs of Eastward’s pixel 
art frequently go viral on games-
focused corners of Twitter.

“Yes, sometimes we feel just 

lucky on Twitter!” Feng wrote. 
“To be honest, Twitter is more 
developer friendly and gathered 
quite a lot (of) pixel artist and 
retro-style-lover-gamers. 
As 
a 

niche market, people are so eager 
to see something awesome or 
done in a new twist. For example, 
we have an in-house engine 
(that) enables dynamic lighting, 
and sometimes (Pixpil designer) 
Tommo will make some neat little 
animation to make the scene look 
‘alive.’ I think that’s basically why 
we’ve got some warm welcomes 
on Twitter.”

Feng told me that Pixpil 

accomplishes 
their 
beautiful 

3-D lighting effects using tools 
written for Moai, a popular open-
source game engine. He credits 
widely available engines like 
Moai, Unity and GameMaker 
with leading a wave of brand-new 
indie developers making great 
games.

“If you take a look into 

human history, every time a true 
revolution/evolution 
happened, 

there was always a kind of 
massively-easy-to-use technology 
behind it,” he said.

Riehl agrees. “It’s become 

so easy now to get into the 
game development field if that’s 
something you want to do,” he said. 
“Obviously it’s not for everyone, 
but if you’re a programmer and 
you’re interested in game design, 
it’s really easy to just go download 
Unity and just start looking up 
tutorials on how to use it. And 
after you spend a few hours, you 
can make a simple platformer 
where you, like, jump around and 
grab a star, or something. So I 
definitely think the availability of 
these tools has led to an increase 

in volume of indie games and 
possibly quality. Now we have 
people that might have great 
ideas, but before they couldn’t get 
into the field. Now it’s really easy 
for them to get a hand in game 
design.”

Some independent developers, 

though, prefer to write their own 
engines. Chevy Ray Johnston is 
the architect of the FlashPunk 
creation library, a set of tools 
designed for assisting developers 
creating 
games 
with 
Flash. 

Johnston is an indie development 
renaissance man, to say the least 
— he’s also the artist, writer, 
designer and programmer of the 
upcoming indie RPG “Ikenfell,” 
an adventure set in a school for 
witches and wizards. Johnston is 
coding the engine for “Ikenfell” 
from scratch in C#.

“I absolutely love writing tools 

and software, maybe as much 
as developing games,” Johnston 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Michigan Daily. “After 
‘Ikenfell’ is done, I plan on 
ramping up the software portion 
of my company as well, selling 
some cool developer apps. I got 
into it through making games. 
Different games have required 
different editor tools in order to 
design them, so building those 
tools helped me find something 
else that I love doing.”

The game looks incredible 

— the art style feels quirky 
and original, the battle system 
looks like a unique combination 
of “Paper Mario” and “Fire 
Emblem” and the setting seems 
like a brilliant opportunity to 
tell stories of teen angst, explore 
hidden secrets and live out classic 
“Harry Potter”/“Carry On”-style 
magical fantasies. 

Gamers 
are 
showing 
no 

shortage 
of 
excitement 
for 

“Ikenfell.” 
Johnston 
received 

$61,787 in funding for the game 
on Kickstarter against a $25,000 
goal — that’s more than Toby 
Fox 
originally 
received 
for 

“Undertale.” He’s even managed 
to attract aivi & surasshu, the 
composers for Cartoon Network’s 
“Steven Universe” (Johnston’s 
favorite cartoon), to write the 
game’s music. 

“I’m so excited about this,” he 

said. “They’re game musicians, 
and I’m a fairly well-known game 
developer, so we crossed paths 
eventually. We didn’t know each 
other that well, but I cold-called 
(because I adore their work on 
‘Steven’) and (sent) them a bunch 
of screenshots and details about 
the game and asked if they were 
interested. They haven’t started 
working on the soundtrack yet, 
but I’ve told them I want them to 
experiment and try some things 
they don’t normally get to try. I 
want the music of the game to 
have a voice of its own. You can 
expect vocals in at least a couple 
of the game’s tracks.”

“Ikenfell” and “Eastward” are 

both superb-looking projects that 
have managed to secure enough 
funding to last through the course 
of development. But if you’re 
planning on getting into game 
development to make money on 
easy street, you may want to look 
more deeply into the realities of 
the industry.

Recently, 
Vice’s 
Waypoint 

published extensive interviews 
with several game developers 
about the harsh lifestyle that 
comes with game development, 
and 
the 
sheer 
difficulty 
of 

managing large-scale projects 
and experimenting with new 
kinds of game mechanics. To 
make 
matters 
worse, 
other 

journalists, such as The Verge’s 
Casey 
Newton, 
have 
grown 

concerned about the financial 
viability 
of 
the 
independent 

market — especially on mobile 
platforms.

Both of the developers I spoke 

to acknowledged the daunting 
challenges behind indie game 
development, and the behind-
the-scenes stress that goes with 
it.

Feng 
said 
the 
more 

management-related 
aspects 

of game development are the 
toughest.

“(The) first (challenge) is to 

decide when to stop and when to 
polish,” he wrote. “There’s always 
(room) for improvement but you 
have to stop somewhere. Knowing 
when to stop is important. Second 
is to hire the right person. It’s 
quite hard here.”

Johnston says it’s the complex 

systems behind certain game 
mechanics that are the most 
challenging to deal with.

“Balancing 
combat 
is 

ridiculously difficult, and I’m still 
working on it,” he wrote. “I’m 
actually just trucking through 

story, cutscenes and level design 
right now. Once I’ve done all that 
in an area, and I’m comfortable 
with the progression, then I go 
back over it and balance out the 
battles. Balancing it is basically 
just constantly tweaking, testing 
and thinking outside the box 
until it feels fun. It’s so much 
work, and even slight changes can 
have a massive butterfly effect in 
how the game feels. It will be a 
struggle until the very end.”

“Doing 
all 
the 
art, 

programming, design and writing 
for such a large game is such a vast 
amount of work I can barely even 
comprehend it sometimes. I just 
hunker down, put on music and 
work all day,” Johnston wrote.

Independent developers are 

also prone to receiving alarming 
amounts of hate for their projects. 
“Fez” developer Phil Fish, one 
of the subjects of “Indie Game: 
The Movie,” infamously quit 
the video game industry after 
being the victim of coordinated 
attacks from #GamerGate (a 
movement 
against 
increased 

gender inclusivity in gaming 
culture) after expressing his 
vocal support for Zoë Quinn, 
another independent developer 
who made international news 
after being subjected to daily 
harassment and threats from 
#GamerGate. More recently, the 
developer of the extraordinarily 
promising-looking RPG “Knuckle 
Sandwich,” 
Andrew 
Brophy, 

has been the victim of what 
appears to be a coordinated 
hate-campaign from 4Chan’s /v/ 
imageboard, posting swarms of 
negative comments on a recent 
promotional 
gameplay 
video 

uploaded to his YouTube channel.

But despite the challenges 

inherent 
to 
the 
profession, 

the 
independent 
development 

community 
shows 
no 
signs 

of 
slowing 
down. 
The 

in-development games featured 
in this article, “Ikenfell” and 
“Eastward,” are merely the tip of 
the iceberg for excellent-looking, 
ludicrously creative video games 
being made by small teams. 
Johnston recently pointed me 
toward “Cryamore,” an anime-
inspired 
action-RPG 
with 

beautiful pixel art that received 
nearly $250,000 in funding on 
Kickstarter. Gabe and Michelle 
Telepak, 
the 
couple 
behind 

the 
adorable 
puppy-themed 

exploration game “Butt Sniffin’ 
Pugs” is so close to hitting their 
$60,000 Kickstarter goal, with 
less than a day left to go. And 
only Tuesday, a Norwegian indie 
development 
studio 
released 

“Owlboy,” a game nearly a decade 
in the making, to overwhelming 
acclaim.

I suppose that I should admit 

to you that I’ve been working 
on my first independent game 
project since summer semester. 
It’s a role-playing game themed 
around 
sexual 
stigma 
called 

“Post Modern Girls.” And while 
I’m working with some excellent 
people on the project — Music, 
Theatre & Dance junior James 
Fischer is composing the music, 
and Eastern Michigan University 
art student Jane Hodges has 
provided some incredible artwork 
— I’m still nervous about so much. 
Am I actually a competent enough 
programmer to make the project 
work? Am I going to be able to get 
funding somehow? What if I do a 
Kickstarter and it fails? What if I 
get hate? What if I’m not talented 
enough to make video games 
after all?

I pestered Johnston to give 

me some advice. His words were 
stern but salient — and I think 
any independent developer could 
draw something helpful from 
what he had to say.

“Keep it simple, and don’t add 

all this complexity to the game. 
It’s way too tempting to add new 
features because you feel like 
the gameplay isn’t deep enough, 
but adding more stuff is not the 
solution to that. All that does is 
water it down. Find the strongest 
aspects of the system and see 
what you can do with them, how 
you can bend and stretch them 
and create new puzzles and 
problems out of them. ‘Portal’ 
isn’t fun because they kept adding 
new guns, it’s fun because one 
gun is all you really need. I think 
if more RPG developers think 
this way, we could see some really 
interesting new games.”

FILM COLUMN

T

his 
column 
contains 

spoilers 
about 
the 

seventh season of “The 

Walking Dead.”

Last 
Sunday, 

“The 
Walking 

Dead” returned for 
its seventh season, 
carrying 
with 
it 

the promise for the 
resolution of season 
six’s cliffhanger — 
who does Negan, 
the show’s latest 
murderous villain, 
kill? There are so 
many reasons why 
that’s a bad cliffhanger, but that’s 
another column.

Negan’s first victim is revealed 

early on in the episode. Abraham 
— a middle-tier character on the 
fan favorite scale — gets a barbed-
wire-wrapped baseball bat to the 
head. It’s gruesome and hard to 
watch. But it’s nothing compared 
to the next beat down in which 
the show returns to its source 
material and has Negan kill 
Glenn (who barely escaped death 
last season) like he does in the 
comic books. The scene is horri-
ble and unnecessarily so. So much 
visual time and space is given to 
Glenn’s bloody head. Even after 
he is reduced to a pile of essen-
tially meat pulp, the camera con-
tinually returns to his corpse.

Intense violence is not new 

in “The Walking Dead,” or any-
where on screen for that mat-
ter. I’ve heard it preached for 
years that violence on-screen 
makes kids more violent because 
it desensitizes them to it. And 
that’s true, but it’s important to 
acknowledge 
different 
repre-

sentations of violence and gore 
on film. The kind shown on the 
season premiere of “The Walking 
Dead” is some of the most dan-
gerous.

It’s dangerous because it is 

both senseless and glorified. The 

whole plotline hinges on who has 
power and who is powerless, the 
person in power being the per-
petrator of violence. What’s more 

telling is that Negan 
becomes 
the 
cen-

ter point of the epi-
sode. The plot exists 
because of him, waits 
for him and then fol-
lows his actions for 
the remainder of the 
episode. Negan is so 
much the episode’s 
star that he almost 
becomes the hero. 
He’s good looking, 

smooth-talking and easily mis-
taken for an actual badass.

He’s the kind of villain that can 

easily be mistaken — especially 
by people who get most of 
their violent imagery through 
first-person video games and 
television — as the sort of Heath 
Ledger in “The Dark Knight” 
antihero. A clear antagonist who 
steals the show with his charm 
and complexity, which makes you 
— if only for a second — almost 
root for him.

But, there are ways to show 

violence that are much more 
intentional, more careful and 
less problematic. “The Walking 
Dead” has done it before. But, 
I’ve already spent enough of this 
“film” column talking about TV. 
Coming out of spook season, 
I’ve seen — and worn — a lot of 
fake blood in the past week. One 
direction, and really my favorite 
direction, that good gore can go is 
absurd. Slasher films of the 1970s 
overflow with the cherry-red 
blood of over-the-top gore. 

A standout for its blood 

to enjoyment ratio is “Texas 
Chainsaw Massacre.” As a kid 
growing up in Texas, I quickly 
became familiar with the plot 
on the slumber party circuit. 
It has a very classic (duh, 
because it is a classic) plot. A 

van full of teenagers runs out 
of gas in rural Texas and slowly 
become victims of Leatherface, 
whose weapon of choice is, you 
guessed it, a chainsaw. It’s a very 
violent movie, but the violence 
is exaggerated to the point of 
absurdity. The characters are 
chainsawed, impaled on meat 
hooks and otherwise hacked to 
death. “Scream” pretty much 
does the same thing. Its opening 
scene is horrifically bloody, but it 
monopolizes on its own absurdity 
— this time in a far more self-
aware way — to draw a fine line 
between 
whose 
actions 
are 

deemed heroic. It pulls us into the 
violence only to push us, leaving 
us disgusted by the brutality and 
our momentary sympathy with it. 

Where “Scream” finds humor, 

“Texas 
Chainsaw 
Massacre” 

finds moments of real cinematic 
beauty. The final two shots, of 
the blood-soaked sole survivor 
being carried to safety in the 
back of a pickup truck and 
Leatherface 
swinging 
his 

chainsaw against the rising sun, 
are oddly beautiful. They remind 
the audience why good horror 
movies are scary — they make 
us want their characters to live, 
while shows like “The Walking 
Dead” tell us we should want to 
watch them die.

Perhaps “The Walking Dead” 

has fallen victim to its medium. 
No matter how gory or gruesome 
horror movies get, most don’t 
last longer than two hours. “The 
Walking Dead” has already run 
for over 80 hours with no end in 
sight. There’s no condemnation 
of the violence and it instills no 
fear in its audience because after 
80 hours of antagonists that are 
either one-sided or literally brain-
dead, the audience has been told 
“This is the way things have to 
be.” Good gore tells its audience 
instead, “This is way things are, 
but not the way they should be.”

The right kind of screen violence

The best kinds of horror movies don’t go with senseless, glorified gore

MADELEINE 

GAUDIN

One of the essential truths of 

this world is spoken in the first 
minute of “Jennifer’s Body:” 
Hell is a teenage girl.

Teenage girls themselves will 

be the first to tell you this is true. 
Their teenage years are a time 
period of endless oscillation 
between viciousness and vul-
nerability, kindness and cruelty. 
It’s no coincidence that teen-
age girls are the stars of most of 
our modern popular horror and 
dystopian fiction — nothing cap-
tures the melodrama and awe 
and ruthlessness better than an 
environment to match.

Bearing this in mind, “Jen-

nifer’s Body” ranks among the 
most definitive portrayals of 
teenage girls navigating the 
mess of high school. It’s not 
“Mean Girls” or “Heathers,” 
but I’d argue it almost deserves 
a place among their ranks. This 
might be surprising, given that 
“Jennifer’s Body” is a largely 
unnoticed movie from 2009 
that barely recouped its bud-
get, despite starring Megan 
Fox at the peak of her post-
“Transformers” uberfame/over-
exposure.

It’s always seemed strange 

to me that this movie never 
attained legend status, because 
it has all the elements of a cult 
classic: killer soundtrack, poor 
box office performance and 
critical reception, questionable 
special effects, a silly story and a 
genuine emotional core ground-
ing the whole affair. And yet, 
here we stand. Another Hallow-
een season passes by and “Jenni-
fer’s Body” still isn’t getting the 
glory it deserves.

“Jennifer’s Body” tells the 

story of Anita “Needy” Lesnicki 
(Amanda Seyfried, “Love the 
Coopers”) and her best friend 
Jennifer, played by Fox. Needy is 
the beta to Jennifer’s alpha, put-

ting up with all kinds of nasty 
jokes and power plays in the 
name of friendship.

Despite this, Needy is very 

clearly in love with Jennifer. 
One night, the girls go to a local 
bar to see an indie band, Low 
Shoulder. Later that night, the 
band kidnaps Jennifer to use 
her in a virgin ritual sacrifice 
to Satan in exchange for fame 
and success. The only problem 
is that Jennifer isn’t a virgin at 
all, so instead of dying, she’s pos-
sessed by a demon that turns her 
into a murderous cannibalistic 
monster.

Despite all the supernatural 

top-layer shenanigans, “Jenni-
fer’s Body” is maybe one of the 
most painfully honest movies 
I’ve seen in its representation of 
the nastiness of adolescence. Not 
in the sense of what happens, 
but in how it’s motivated and in 
the precision of the character-
izations. There’s the the indie 
pretentiousness of the members 
of Low Shoulder, matching cres-
cent moon tattoos and all — “Do 
you want to work at Costa Cof-
fee forever?” asks the lead singer 
to his hesitant drummer when 
he voices nervousness about 
actually murdering Jennifer, “or 
do you want to be rich and awe-
some, like that guy from Maroon 
5?” There’s the dopey apathetic 
faux-concern of Needy’s boy-
friend, who repeatedly fails to 
believe her when she warns him 
about Jennifer being a demon. 
“Needy, I care about you as a 
person” he says, “not just some 
girl I made love to for four min-
utes the other night.”

Then, of course, there’s Jen-

nifer. She’s mean and callous 
even before the demonic pos-
session, but she’s first and fore-
most vulnerable. You see it in 
the way her voice rises an octave 
as she flirts with the older, more 
sophisticated band members of 
Low Shoulder, in her inability to 
ever hurt her best friend despite 
her all-encompassing demonic 

urges and in the hurt she feels 
when Needy throws her out of 
her house.

There’s a scene late in the 

movie in which Jennifer is get-
ting ready for the big dance. 
We see her reflection up close 
in a small mirror on her desk. 
She’s smearing makeup on her 
face, and the look in her eyes 
is unmistakable if you’re at all 
familiar with the feeling: she’d 
give anything to be anybody else 
in this moment.

Perhaps the most truthful ele-

ment of “Jennifer’s Body” is the 
relationship between Needy and 
Jennifer. They’re deeply devot-
ed to each other in the obsessive, 
intensive way that’s so specific 
to the friendships of teenage 
girls. Their power dynamics 
shift continually from scene to 
scene, minute to minute. They 
love each other, they hate each 
other, they try to kill each other. 
It’s deeply complicated and 
ridiculous in the way only high 
school can be.

The main issue critics took 

with “Jennifer’s Body” was that 
it wasn’t scary enough to be an 
effective horror movie. Now, it’s 
not that the critics were wrong, 
per se, just that I think they 
might have misunderstood the 
movie’s intentions. The movie 
never intended to frighten with 
jump scares or monster makeup. 
“Jennifer’s Body” was about the 
visceral, heart-pounding bru-
tality with which teenage girls 
tear themselves and each other 
apart — all bared teeth, sharp 
smiles and the awful emptiness 
of wanting everything so very 
deeply and for far too much.

So, the weak humor and hor-

ror actually matters very little 
— it’s funny in the ways it needs 
to be, in ways that are true to 
the characters. And it’s scary in 
ways that are true to life. Noth-
ing is more terrifying than a 
teenage girl willing to do what-
ever it takes to get exactly what 
she wants.

‘Body’ mixes teen angst with horror

 Charli XCX is no newcomer 
to the pop scene, and she’s 
not pulling any punches in 
“After the Afterparty.” Featur-
ing Atlanta-based rapper Lil 
Yachty, the song jumps from 
sickly sweet piano pop song 
to rampant party anthem in 
a matter of seconds. This is 

an unashamed, straight-to-
the-point ode to partying all 
night and not regretting it the 
next morning. Similar in tone 
to Miley Cyrus’s “We Can’t 
Stop” (in fact, both videos are 
directed by Diane Martel), the 
lyrics capture the true essence 
of partying, albeit without the 
most quotable words.
 The chorus is definitely the 
highlight, with repetitions of 
“we’re all in love” — destined 
to be repeated at many a house 
party in the next few months. 
Charli XCX’s voice is near-
flawless for this kind of music; 

the harmonies and overlay-
ing vocals really add to her 
appeal as the best party friend 
that you could want. Even Lil 
Yachty’s verse fits well, and the 
inclusion never seems forced, 
like many rap verses in pop 
songs do.
 References to Rihanna and 
partying all weekend mean 
this song was likely never 
something serious. Charli XCX 
is known for her tongue-in-
cheek electropop, and that’s 
just what you get from this 
high-energy collab.

is 
Theo 

Katzman 
— 

drummer, guitarist, 
singer 
and 
2007 

graduate from the 
University’s 
jazz 

program 
— 
best 

known 
around 

Tree Town for his 
work with the funk 
group Vulfpeck and 
former electro-pop 
group, My Dear Disco, currently 
on tour for his next solo album, 
due for release in January. For the 
first time since 2011, Katzman is 
returning to Ann Arbor for a solo 
performance at the Blind Pig this 
Saturday, Nov. 5. 

It has been a swift climb to 

popularity for Katzman, who for 
six years has been collaborating 
with Vulfpeck, while concurrently 
working on his own projects. 
Since graduating, he has been a 
part of the aforementioned My 
Dear Disco, written and produced 
music with the likes of Darren 
Criss and Ann Arbor’s Charlene 
Kaye, released his first solo album 
Heartbreak Hits and collaborated 
on six Vulfpeck projects — four 
EPs and two full-length albums.

Impressive, yes, but even more 

so when considering the broad 
array of genres encompassed 
under all these projects. From 
funk to rock to pop, Katzman has 
covered and mastered it all in his 
written and collaborative work. 
Vulfpeck brings the funk and 
Katzman comes in solo with the 
pop and rock, not to mention a 
moment of Irish-American fusion 
when he toured with The Olllam 
in 2014.

“Nowadays I’m making the 

kind of music I want to make both 
with my solo project and with 
Vulfpeck,” Katzman said. “But my 
thing is more of a rock thing, and 
Vulfpeck is more of a funk thing.”

Originally from Long Island, 

Katzman grew up surrounded 
by music. A professional jazz 
trumpetist, his dad played in the 
studio band during the Johnny 
Carson years at “The Tonight 
Show,” and his grandparents, 
classical musicians, performed 
in orchestras like The Detroit 
Symphony and The Philadelphia 
Orchestra. Music obviously runs 
in his veins, but Katzman insists 
there was nothing forcing him 
into creative arts; he simply found 
himself there by the booming 
progression of John Bonham’s 
groove.

“(Because of my dad) I knew 

it was possible to have a life in 
music. A lot of kids don’t know 
it’s possible, and that makes a big 
difference in whether you take the 
step to try to focus on it,” Katzman 
said.

Katzman formed his first band 

in high school — a little indie 
thing by the name of Lovango. 
They were deep underground, 
too big for Myspace or Bandcamp, 
but not too big for inexplicably 
strange names. From there, he 
entered the University’s Jazz and 
Contemplative Studies program, 
where he contemplated jazz with 
a focus in drums — his weapon of 
choice.

“I was in the Jazz program, and 

I was definitely a lost soul there,” 

Katzman said. “I didn’t feel like 
a jazz player even though I liked 
jazz a lot … I was always kind of 
trying to start a rock band.”

Not exclusively rock, My Dear 

Disco/Ella Riot was a product 
of this pursuit, where Katzman 
played 
with 
future 
Vulfpeck 

members Joe Dart and Joey 

Dosik. 
After 

touring with them 
for three years, 
Katzman 
sought 

his 
own 
solo 

career, beginning 
work on his debut 
album 
Romance 

Without Finance in 
2009 and releasing 
it in 2011. While 
on tour, Katzman 
performed 
with 

Love Massive, a band that also 
included Dart, after releasing 
the first full-length album from 
Vulfpeck that same year.

And with The Beautiful Game, 

Vulfpeck’s second LP, coming out 
only weeks ago, Katzman has once 
again hit the road to promote his 
next solo album after writing and 
producing both albums over the 
course of the last two years. Two 
different sounds at the exact same 
time, but with a similar range 
of artists collaborating — Dart, 
Dosik and Julian Allen, the three 
of whom will be at the Blind Pig, 
along with Woody Goss and Tyler 
Duncan, a producer who recorded 
much of the album at his home 
studio in Ann Arbor. The uniting 
thread between all of these 
absurdly talented artists? Just that 
— absurdity and Ann Arbor.

“It’s sort of like in each different 

project there’s been different 
levels of going back to Ann Arbor,” 
Katzman continued. “It’s a scene. 
Ann Arbor is a great breeding 
ground for the future arties of the 
world.”

So let’s bring on the rock 

now, because despite Vulfpeck’s 
undeniable 
mastery 
of 
funk, 

Katzman’s here to play a rock 
show and give some advice about 
life and the blind chances he takes 
as a multi-instrumentalist in it. 
His next album is “more rock and 
a little heavier” than the acoustic 
lightness of his first; it’s more rock 
‘n’ roll.

“I’m hoping people think (the 

different genres are) interesting 
and not just confusing, but that’s 
the risk you take by just being 
alive,” Katzman said. “People 
project sometimes that they’re 
trying to fit into a particular 
mold because maybe it seems 
like it’s more marketable. But 
our generation will be testing 
the limits of this because we are 
the iTunes generation. We’re the 
kids who grew up listening to 
all different kinds of music, who 
grew up listening to the greatest 
hits.”

And he’s right. In the digital 

age, we have every kind of music 
at our fingertips for the first time 
in history. Not only does this 
give us unbelievable power to 
converge different sounds, but 
it also encourages the testing 
of limits with what can be 
mixed and messed with. There’s 
boundless opportunity to derive 
influence from Funk Brothers 
and Frank Ocean; there are 
endless occasions to match wits 
with James Brown and Jimmy 
Page, as long as there’s something 
to hold the sounds together. For 
Katzman, that something is the 
lyrics.

“What will glue everything 

together is good songwriting. If 
the songs are good it shouldn’t 

matter what the styles are; 
you should be able to pull 
from anywhere in that realm,” 
Katzman said. “Lyrics are my 
favorite 
element 
of 
writing, 

and they’re usually where I get 
my musical ideas. I try to get a 
concept and go from there.”

Maybe that’s why Katzman 

has perfected the pop-rock song. 
Listen to “Backpocket” off of 
Vulfpeck’s Thrill of the Arts, a 
track Katzman wrote, and tell 
me you don’t want to dance. Now 
listen to songs like “Hard Work” 
and “Brooklyn” and tell me you 
don’t want to dance harder. It’s 
not the same funk of the Vulf, but 
it’s the rock Elvis brought when 
he started shaking his hips. It’s 
popular music done right.

“I think quality music is 

becoming very popular based on 
its own merit again,” Katzman 
said. “The independent artists 
movement is finally starting to get 
its own footing with the Internet 
now that streaming is more 
widespread and the technology 
is more readily available to create 
art for everybody. I think good 
music’s coming back.”

This isn’t your Top 40 pop 

that strains the ears with every 
repetitive 
chord 
progression 

after the next. This isn’t your 
New 98.7 radio trash. This is your 
“White Picket Castle” crying self 
who wants to feel those deeply 
buried emotions in the pit of 
your stomach, in your gut; it’s the 
person who wants to shamelessly 
dance to a modern rock song 
without the sub-genres’ smirks 
lingering in your peripheral. 
This is music that makes you 
want to feel expressively and 
unrelentingly.

“I 
want 
people 
to 
feel 

something. I want people to 
feel inspired and moved into 
their 
own 
creative 
power,” 

Katzman said. “I think inspired 
art inspires, and I try to make 
music that emotionally resonates 
with me and try to extrapolate 
real feelings that are human 
whether it’s my own feelings or 
someone else’s and turn that into 
a compelling piece of art. So when 
I play live I really aim to transfer 
that to the audience, the same 
kind of emotion that went into 
making the music.”

And sometimes that feeling 

requires one to sell one’s soul 
to Billy Joel — c’est la vie. But 
no matter the cost, come join 
Katzman, Dosik, Dart and Allen 
in their journey to rock. Try and 
see it as a humanitarian effort or 
a certain kind of charity work.

“Live performance of music 

specifically can bring people 
together; it can bring people in 
better harmony with themselves. 
Not 
that 
I’m 
doing 
it 
for 

humanitarian reasons, I just love 
to rock, I’m a rock dude, and I 
need to play — that’s not the same 
as real charity work. It’s rock n’ 
roll.”

Listen to Dosik sing his soulful 

tunes and witness Joe Dart tug at 
the bass like he’s playing strings 
of a heart as Katzman reminisces 
on his time passing out in the 
green room of the Blind Pig 
after “I-don’t-even-know what 
concert.” Come for the music, 
stay for the living proof that some 
unbelievably talented individuals 
survive to tell their tale of the 
University, even if they lost their 
documented proof.

“I can’t find my diploma, so I 

hope that I don’t actually have to 
present it to anyone,” Katzman 
concluded. “Trust me though, I 
did college.”

Do you ever think about where 

the loaf of bread you just bought 
comes from? Who grew the wheat 
and grinded it into flour? Where 
was it baked and by whom? If 
you’re like most people, then the 
answer is likely “No.”

In today’s world (the first world 

that is), food is pervasively readily 
available for consumption. We 
don’t necessarily think much 
about where our food comes 
from, because we don’t have to. 
Society has become fixated on and 
structured around the practicality 
and ease of mass consumption. 
We have fast food and cupcake 
vending machines, frozen meals 
and restaurant take out. 

But when asked to recall what 

some of our most meaningful 
experiences around a table are 
with friends or family, we’ll likely 
answer with “eating a meal.” At 
least that’s what the students 
who attended the first of three 
cooking workshops hosted by the 
University of Michigan Hillel’s 
Rabbi Lisa Stella this past Sunday 
would tell you.

Before I go any further, I’d first 

like to say that I’m by no means a 
religious or very spiritual person 
and my intention here isn’t to 
proselytize. I was approached 
with the opportunity to share 
my love of cooking while also 
exploring its connection to my 
cultural roots through Rabbi Lisa’s 
cooking seminar. The seminar 
itself is intended to help students 
interested in hosting others for 
Shabbat meals feel comfortable 
cooking by giving them the tools 
and recipes to create both a meal 
and welcome others into their 
homes, while also exploring Jewish 
studies related to cooking and 
hospitality (for those interested in 
coming to the next session, you can 
sign up here). Shabbat is the weekly 
day of rest, which different Jewish 
families celebrate differently.

I gladly took on this opportunity 

to 
examine 
food 
through 
a 

different lens. After all, I am a food 
writer and examining different 
cultural 
practices 
surrounding 

food is part of the job. And through 
the inextricable link between food 
and culture, I have gained a new 
perspective on not only the way I 

cook and consume food, but also 
the way I share it with others.

In the first session, students 

gathered together to learn a 
challah recipe (a Jewish egg 
bread) and discussed the symbolic 
meaning of bread as sustenance. 
While we kneaded, mixed and 
waited for our bread to bake we 
learned to make a few easy dips 
for the bread (recipes below). We 
roasted a head of garlic, smashed 
chickpeas and combined them 
with tahini and green onions for 
a salad and blended white beans 
with garlic and oil for a creamy 
hummus-like dip (all in under 20 
minutes!).

After our rolls turned golden 

brown in the oven and the kitchen 
was filled with the sweet, rich 
smell of baked bread we sat around 
the dining room table, enjoyed the 
product of our culinary labor and 
discussed some Jewish texts.

I was surprised by what I 

learned. I hadn’t known what to 
expect, considering the last time I 
was exposed to any sort of Jewish 
learning was back when I still 
had braces (at the age of 13, prior 
to my Bat Mitzvah). We began 
by discussing the significance 
of the blessing over challah (or 
the “Hamotzi”) — something 
my mother had instructed me in 
saying at every Shabbat dinner 
when I was younger. I’d never 
considered what the rhythmic 
words actually meant. It was 
just something I had to do before 
eating on Friday nights, a measure 
put in place before I could indulge 
in our meal.

I learned that bread in Judaism 

is a spiritual food. It represents 
our ability to create something 
from nothing to sustain ourselves 
— something we don’t often 
recognize when we purchase 
bread at a bakery without seeing 
the work that went into making 
it. How we get our food now, for 
the most part, is so removed from 
the ways in which it’s grown and 
made, especially if we don’t cook it 
ourselves. This underappreciation 
of food in our society makes us 
forget the precarious balance of 
our position within this world. 
Whether you’re religious or not 
(like myself) there’s great value in 
recognizing that our food comes 
from somewhere and had to be 
made by someone.

Although cooking is one way 

that helps remind us of this labor, 
the simple practice of mindfulness 
when we eat — sharing a meal with 
others, setting apart a time and 
space in our days for a meal or sim-
ply taking a moment to acknowl-
edge and appreciate the food we’re 
eating — helps keep us grounded. 
When we’re able to examine the 
seemingly trivial aspects of our 
day-to-day lives, we’re then able 
to consider phenomena of greater 
importance.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

When God called out to 

Abraham, Abraham responded 
simply, “Here I am,” a response 
that brings equal 
parts clarity and 
confusion. It’s so 
simple 
and 
yet 

provokes questions 
like, “Who is he?” 
and 
“Where 
is 

here?” and “Why is 
he there?”

Those 
words, 

and the mess they 
bear, serve as the title of Jonathan 
Safran Foer’s latest book. It’s the 
first novel in over a decade from 
Foer, who will be at Rackham 
Auditorium on Friday for a 
reading and conversation with the 
director of the Helen Zell Writers 
Program, Douglas Trevor.

“Here I Am” follows the Bloch 

family — most closely, its boys, 
men and almost-men — as the 
family navigates death, divorce 
and bar mitzvahs. “Here I Am” is 
all about the placement of things. 
Physical place, emotional place 
and historical place mix and mess 
with each other.

“There’s a funny way in which a 

book can be an expression of one’s 
emotional place but it can also 
place you emotionally. It works 
in both directions,” Foer said in a 
phone interview. This emotional 
placement, 
he 
continued, 
is 

something he strives for in all his 
work.

“I 
wouldn’t 
say 
they’re 

autobiographical 
or 
cathartic 

or therapeutic, but that they’re 
expressive,” he said in reference 
to his novels.

“Here I Am” is a departure 

from Foer’s earlier work. 11 years 

later, he’s much 
closer to being the 
second-coming 
of Philip Roth his 
critics always said 
he should be.

“When I was 

younger 
I 
was 

more into magi-
cal realism and 
big visuals and 

big voices and now there’s some-
thing about a certain kind of pre-
cision … and dialogue that I like 
more,” Foer said.

His first two novels, “Every-

thing 
is 
Illuminated” 
and 

“Extremely Loud and Incred-
ibly Close,” have a whimsical and 
winding style. “Here I Am” has 
its feet more solidly on the earth; 
it’s grounded and sharply real.

Foer painstakingly paints the 

lives of the Blochs, from their 
“Miele vacuum, Vitamix blender, 
Misono knives” to their con-
sumption of “Freudian amounts 
of sushi.” He creates, through 
these meticulous details, a world 
that is so closely related to the 
present world. A world where the 
bodies of Syrian children wash 
up on beaches and Rihanna lyr-
ics can be a personal ethos.

“I don’t know that I’m any 

better at life than I was before 
I knew anything. Sometimes 

knowing things makes it harder,” 
Foer said in regards to the former 
image. The book grapples with 
the reconciliation of mundane 
tragedies — divorce, getting 
in trouble in Hebrew school, 
the death of an internet avatar 
— against the tragedies of the 
rest of the world. As the main 
character’s marriage unravels 
stateside, 
the 
Middle 
East 

unravels following devastating 
earthquakes hitting Israel and 
the West Bank.

With “Here I Am,” Foer 

creates quite the tangle of 
character and storylines, of ideas 
and questions. But it is not his 
intention to untie the knot their 
lives and issues create.

“I think for me a book is not 

like coming upon a jigsaw puzzle 
in the forest and saying, ‘Oh, 
let’s see if I can put this thing 
together,’” he said. “It’s more like 
coming upon … a leaf or a feather 
in a forest and saying, ‘What is 
this? Where did it come from?’”

The success of the novel, for 

Foer, lies not in its ability to 
answer big questions or solve 
big problems, but in its ability to 
capture him emotionally.

“I 
don’t 
really 
have 
any 

definition of good that I care 
about or even aim myself toward 
other than the book being a kind 
of expression of where I am in 
that period of time emotionally.”

Thus, the answer to the 

questions raised by the book’s 
title easily could be both Foer’s 
dining room in Brooklyn and the 
book itself.

I MISS YOU DAD

The Facebook group was created by two Welsh sisters looking for a place to grieve.

I want to tell you about a meme I 

saw the other day.

I’m usually pretty skeptical of 

memes. For some reason, it seems 
that under the shadow of the 
presidential election, memes have 
been co-opted into a lazy form of 
political dialogue. I do not claim 
to understand why Minions, the 
little yellow cartoon characters, 
are frequently juxtaposed with 
strange, 
conservative 
ideologi-

cal statements. Nor do I claim to 
understand why the “Pepe the 
Frog” meme became a war-banner 
for Donald Trump’s alt-right move-
ment. And it’s not just conserva-
tives that use viral images in such a 
bizarre way. I’m sure anyone from 
any political background has seen 
their parents’ friends post unset-
tlingly strange memes on their 
Facebook walls.

Usually I just ignore them, 

because most of the time they’re 
meaningless or vexing. But I saw a 
meme the other day that complete-
ly and utterly stopped me in my 
tracks. A girl from my hometown 
of Dexter, Mich. posted an image 
that was completely black, save for 
white text. It read: “i miss my dad 
so much.”

That was it. No Minions. No 

Photoshop-derived garnishes. Just 
that simple, heart-wrenching state-
ment — “i miss my dad so much.”

Suddenly, I wondered how this 

young lady must have been feel-
ing when she shared the post. 
What was initially bewilderment 
at the fact that such a horrific and 
depressing statement was shared 
via a meme — a theoretically mean-
ingless, vexing meme — quickly 
dissolved into empathy. We’ve all 
lost a family member. This girl 
just had the misfortune of losing 
one of her closest, and at a way too 
young age. And then she posted on 
Facebook about it. I felt really bad. 
Maybe she needed someone to talk 
to.

To my further surprise, this 

image was by no means the only 
one of its kind. As I clicked through 
to the image’s page of origin, sim-
ply called “I miss you Dad,” I found 
dozens and dozens more posts just 
like it, and thousands and thou-
sands of likes and comments, all 
about deceased fathers. Every sin-
gle one. 

“Was this time last year Dads 

chest X-rays came back (sad 
emoji),” read one comment. 

“The beginning of a heartbreak-

ing journey. Wish we had had more 

time together x.”

“My dad has been in heaven for 3 

years now and i miss him very very 
much,” reads another.

“Its very hard for me this time 

of year because he was my hunt-
ing buddy, and we had a lot of good 
times. I love you dad and miss you. 
Thoughts and Prayers to all who 
lost their dad.” 

The page has 484,002 followers. 
“We were very close to our dad,” 

said Rachel, one of the owners of 
the page. She runs it with her sister, 
Michelle. “He wasn’t just our dad, 
but our best friend. We could speak 
to him about absolutely anything.”

Rachel, who declined to give 

her last name, wrote in a Face-
book message conversation with 
The Michigan Daily that she and 
Michelle grew up in a little town in 
Wales. Rachel works as a carer in 
the UK, and has mostly grown-up 
children with her spouse. 

She said, the sisters were devas-

tated by their father’s early pass-
ing from cancer, following a heart 
attack at the age of 39.

“When dad was diagnosed with 

cancer, it felt like our world had 
been blown apart,” Rachel wrote. 
“My sister and I moved in with him 
and cared for him throughout his 
illness, until the end came … We 
were with him when he passed.”

That’s 
when 
Rachel 
and 

Michelle turned to Facebook.

“In the months following dad’s 

death, we searched Facebook for 
others that had been through the 
same as we had and took comfort 
in reading different quotes,” Rachel 
wrote. “We found we could relate to 
a lot of the posts and saw that there 
were others who had lost parents, 
partners 
and, 
heartbreakingly, 

children. We wanted to make 
a page for us. A page where my 
sister and I could post our feelings 
through quotes and pictures.”

And so they did. What they 

didn’t expect was their page to 
get nearly 500,000 followers, and 
dozens of comments on every post. 
Along with their administrators, 
they still post images that go viral 
almost every day. One recent image 
was a photo of an autumn-tinged 
forest, with the caption: “Honestly 
— I spent today missing you and 
that is probably how I will spend 
tomorrow, and the day after that, 
and all of the days after that, too. 
#missingyou.” 
The 
comments? 

Stories 
from 
people, 
mostly 

women, from every background, 
about their fathers.

A father that died in a car acci-

dent. A father that died from can-
cer. Heart attack. Truck wreck. 
A baby girl dying at five weeks. A 

father dying on his son’s birthday. 
A woman pledging to sleep next to 
her father’s metal detector.

“The pain will be with me until 

it’s my turn <3.”

“My dad has been dead for 58 

years.”

“I can’t even describe it.”
Though many of the images 

make references to heaven, “better 
places” and other places of eternal 
rest, Rachel told me that she and 
Michelle are not religious women.

“We respect other religions 

and are aware other people might 
be/are religious,” she wrote. “We 
speak with and help people from 
all over the world and have met 
with some unusual traditions and 
interesting ones too. Religion plays 
a role on the page for those who 
find comfort from it.”

One of Rachel and Michelle’s 

administrators has of late started 
a small business on the page selling 
charms. After receiving requests 
for charms to remember their loved 
ones by, the admin began selling 
metal charms to members of the 
group. According to Rachel, the 
initiative is a new, but successful, 
venture.

But it’s not about the money for 

Rachel and Michelle. For Rachel, 
the true value of the page lies in 
the connections she makes with 
people around the world.

“There are so, so, many (stories 

and) they are all touching in 
different ways,” Rachel wrote. 
“I’ve had a few that have made 
me cry. One young man saw his 
dad killed by a gang … He was 
very descriptive and his words 
will haunt me forever. A lady 
wrote a story about her life with 
her dad, her life after her dad 
and then being diagnosed with 
cancer herself and having to leave 
her own children behind. It was 
beautifully heartbreaking.

“People message me because 

they feel suicidal. Others need 
support or advice. I have made a 
few friends on the page. Though 
we don’t talk away from the page, 
we chat in general and share com-
mon interests, etc. The comments 
and likes on the page? Yes, the 
comments have helped with my 
own tragedy. Talking to others 
and helping others has helped me 
work through some of my pain. 
The likes? I guess it’s nice to know 
people like what you do, but I’ve 
never been big on likes.

“Actual words of support, I find, 

are better,” Rachel said.

How two sisters created a dialogue 
about death and family via Facebook

‘I Miss You Dad’ provides forum for grieving daughters, family members

 There truly could not have 
a been a more wonderful 
surprise for metal/hardcore 
enthusiasts to wake up to on 
Halloween than a new music 
video from Code Orange, 
announcing their upcoming 
album Forever. The music 
video for this title track looks 
like it came straight out of 
a horror movie, as it depicts 
rebirth through death.
 It’s no secret that Code 
Orange is a band known for 
abrasive tunes and violent 

songwriting, and “Forever” 
holds true to the status quo. 
It’s exceptionally gritty, 
completely absent of all color 
except blood red. The video 
quickly cuts between shots 
of the band aggressively 
jamming out and ritualistic 
imagery: a circle of candles, a 
bucket of blood and figures in 
cloaks. It’s the perfect video 
for the Halloween season and 
horror fans, and additionally 
honors the band’s past.
 The ritual contains a lot 
of symbolism about the 
band’s direction with the 
new album. Inside the 
candle circle, the words “It’s 
Almost Forever” are spelled. 
Figures in faceless red suits 

violently destroy a crown 
with hammers. A girl rises 
from the bucket of blood. In 
closing the video, a body bag 
is dragged outside and cut 
open, revealing “I Am King” 
engraved on the victim’s 
forehead, which is the title 
(and literally the album art) of 
their previous album.
 Code Orange has effectively 
set the stage for the January 
release of Forever with their 
new video, and have left fans 
eager for what’s to come in 
the next few months. It’s 
almost forever, and Code 
Orange doesn’t care if you’re 
ready or not.

FILM INTERVIEW

“What happened is that the 

world changed in the last 18 
months,” said Abby Ginzberg, the 
co-director and co-producer of 
the new documentary, “Agent of 
Change,” in a recent phone inter-
view. “Between Black Lives Mat-
ter and college campuses really 
reacting and having their own 
demonstrations, it became anoth-
er activist moment. It connected 
the story we were telling to the 
present, and it totally transformed 
the film.”

The documentary “Agents of 

Change” looks at the untold story 
of the struggle for a more mean-
ingful education for Black students 
on college campuses nationwide 
in the late 1960s. Ginzberg and 
her co-director and co-producer, 
Frank Dawson, were on the cam-
pus of Cornell University during a 
pivotal moment in the movement 
to expose racism in higher educa-
tion — a 1969 takeover of a cam-
pus building by Black students in 
protest of recent discriminatory 
events. They joined forces to cre-
ate a film documenting the expe-
riences they had and witnessed 
during the demonstrations.

“The film’s characters were 

caught at the crossroads of the civil 
rights, Black power and anti-Viet-

nam war movements at a pivotal 
time in America’s history,” Ginz-
berg said. “Today, over 45 years 
later, many of the same demands 
are surfacing in campus protests 
across the country, revealing how 
much work remains to be done.”

Ginzberg asserted that the 

experiences of the characters in 
the film were not unique to Cor-
nell or San Francisco State Uni-
versity — demonstrations and 
demands for more Black students 
and professors took place at col-
leges across the country. She and 
Dawson felt the need to tell the 
story through the film because of 
its lack of representation in the 
media and in history as a whole.

“I don’t know why the story 

hadn’t been told before,” Ginz-
berg said. “Each generation finds 
something in the generation that 
preceded it that needs to be told, 
and it hasn’t been told as well as it 
should have. There are blackouts 
throughout incredible parts of 
American history. I think this is 
just one example of it.”

The film aims to inspire its 

collegiate audiences to look at 
the representation of their own 
schools and consider the racial 
dynamics of the classrooms and 
the dearth of spaces for people of 
color. Ginzberg said she thinks the 
film especially has the potential 
to create open dialogue because 
of the partnership of herself and 

Dawson, as a white woman and a 
Black man.

“We reflect different aspects of 

what the struggle was like, at this 
case in Cornell. The reason San 
Francisco State and Cornell were 
successful was that, over time, 
they were supported by a majority 
of white students,” Ginzberg said. 
“Down the road, there was an alli-
ance between the majority of the 
white students and the demands 
of the Black students. That story 
is told visually in the film, and I 
think that’s an important aspect 
to this.”

The film’s ability to start a con-

versation after it’s over is also con-
tingent on the group of people. 
Ginzberg emphasized the neces-
sity to have both Black and white 
students, faculty and adminis-
trators committed to the issue to 
have a productive dialogue and 
facilitate change on a larger scale.

“We want all people who care 

about issues of race on campus. 
It’s been important that we have 
representations from across the 
campus present at every screen-
ing because the film evokes a 
dialogue,” Ginzberg said. “We’re 
hopeful that the film begins a dia-
logue that can continue long after 
the film screening is over. The 
film is designed to link up with 
the struggles that are taking place 
today, even though on each cam-
pus, it’s a different story.”

BEST CONCERT EVER

In this new miniseries, Daily 

Music Writers reminisce on the 
best live show they ever saw.

If I had asked 14-year-old me 

what I saw myself doing the day 
before graduation, my younger 
self would probably have thought 
I’d be burning all of my homework 
assignments or doing something 
equally exhilaratingly destruc-
tive. Instead, I’m sitting on the 
sun-baked pavement outside of St. 
Andrews Hall in Detroit, trying 
to keep the loose shards of grav-
el scattered about from slowly 
migrating up my shorts.

The exterior of the building is 

worn, slightly graffitied, infused 
with the ghosts of concerts past, 
as if the furious energies of those 
countless nights have bled straight 
through the walls of the hall. I’m 
sweaty and hungry, but the antici-
pation pumping through my veins 
fuels me, keeping my limbs rest-
less and my mood bright.

It starts raining 30 minutes 

before doors open. A few lucky 
people take cover under the 
awnings that poke out from the 
building next door, but most of us 
are vulnerable, left to conquer the 
weather with nothing but the con-
tents of our bags.

When I finally inch into the 

hall, the air conditioning washes 
over me like a calm, fresh wave. 

I find myself shivering uncon-
trollably, partially because of the 
excitement and partially because 
of the rain that has dampened 
my head and back. I head straight 
for the front, delving deeper into 
the mesmerizing fog and danc-
ing lights with each step. I end up 
right at the barricade, mere feet 
away from the edge of the stage. 
People mill around, bodies com-
pacting closer and closer together 
with each consecutive opening 
act.

The wait is long, but PVRIS 

finally comes onstage in a flurry 
of sound and flashing light, diving 
into “Smoke” to lead off the night. 
I’ve listened to their album, White 
Noise, countless times, but never 
like this, with the world feeling 
like it’s exploding apart and the 
decibels roaring so loudly that my 
very bones vibrate. Lynn Gunn’s 
singing isn’t perfectly polished 
the way it is on studio recordings, 
but the tiny imperfections and 
spontaneous embellishments she 
adds to the songs develop them 
into entirely new works of art. I 
scream along as loudly as I can, 
and when my throat starts to feel 
hoarse, I double my volume.

In between songs she speaks to 

us, her voice warm and sweet, a 
clear contrast to the vivid energy 
of the music. She orders us to jump 
and we do, flashing brightly as the 
lights onstage cheer us on. The 
crowd becomes one boisterous, 
thrashing organism and I feel as if 

my body cannot possibly contain 
all of the life I’m experiencing.

My favorite part of the night 

is right at the last song, when she 
leaps down from the stage and 
walks through the pit, along the 
boundary that divides the hall 
between her domain and ours. 
Her voice grows ever powerful as 
she stalks along the line, buoyed 
by the watchful gazes of the burly 
security guards that stand vigi-
lantly within arms reach and the 
force of our fevered screaming. 
She reaches out for us and we 
reach back, still awestruck that 
this lioness is here in the flesh. 
Her hands are small, warm and 
somehow dry despite the heat and 
the effort she’s putting into the 
performance.

The concert ends far too 

abruptly; they finish with their 
most well-known song, then cata-
pult off the stage with a bang. We 
pour out of the space in a mess of 
bodies, and I find myself back at 
the same spot of pavement, slight-
ly unsteady on my feet. When 
people ask me about my favorite 
band, I tell them about the bass, 
the drums and Lynn’s wonderful 
voice, but I never mention the aca-
demic, personal or mental strug-
gles that PVRIS has helped me 
through. The night leaves me bit-
tersweetly nostalgic yet hopefully 
euphoric, ready to face college and
