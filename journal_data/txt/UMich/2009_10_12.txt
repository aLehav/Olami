Helen Thomas,
among others, to
receive honorary
degrees at ceremony
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
In an exclusive interview last
week, University President Mary
Sue Coleman said officials will
announce today that Jeff Daniels
has been chosen to headline Win-
ter Commencement.
Daniels has been selected
to deliver the commencement
address and will receive an honor-
ary degree. Helen Thomas, Edward.
Wilson and Grace Boggs will also
attend winter graduation ceremo-
nies and receive honorarydegrees.
The selections, which require
approval by the University's Board
of Regents, will be released in the
regents' agenda today at noon.
Coleman said she is extremely
excited about the arrival of the
four attendees and looks forward
to their time on campus.
"They're wonderful individu-
als and they will bring some real
distinction to winter commence-
ment," Coleman said.

Daniels, a Michigan native who
lives in the nearby city of Chelsea,
is well known for his Broadway
performances, musical albums and
many film appearances. He has
been nominated three times for the
Golden Globes and once for a Tony
Award. Daniels is the founder of
the Purple Rose Theater Company
in Chelsea and is a spokesman for
the Pure Michigan Campaign,
which aims to increase travel and
tourism in the state.
"The reason we chose him is
because he's been such a pro-
lific actor both in movies and on
Broadway," Coleman said. "We're
very proud of what he's done for
Michigan."
Thomas, a widely known and
well-respectedreporter,has worked
in the White House Press Corps
since JohnF.Kennedytookoffice.
Born in Detroit, Thomas was
the first woman to serve as an offi-
cer of the National Press Club, the
first woman to serve as president of
the White House Correspondents
Association and the first woman to
become a member of the Gridiron
Club- a group of some of the most
influential leaders in the media.
Coleman, who first met Thomas
a year and a half ago in Dubai, said
she is eager to see her again.

Gay prof.'s lawsuit moves on, slowly

Without approval,
letter sent with

By MATT AARONSON
Daily News Editor
In a statement released Friday,
UniversityPresidentMarySueCole-
man hinted at her disapproval of a
letter sent last week to a state legis-

lator with her name on it, but would
not go as far as to denounce it.
The letter, which bore Coleman's
name withouther explicit approval,
advocated for the passage of a state
budget plan that would eliminate
the Michigan Promise Scholarship.
The letterhead included Cole-
man's name along with 70 other
business and political leaders from
the Detroit-based Business Lead-
ers for Michigan. It was addressed
to Dave Hildenbrand (R-Lowell),

the Republican floor leader for the
state House of Representatives. It is
dated Oct. 6.
Coleman and three other state
university presidents - Jerry
Noren of Wayne State University,
Gary Russi of Oakland University
and Lou Anna Simon of Michigan
State University - are members
of the organization, but only Doug
Rothwell, the group's president and
CEO, signed the letter.

Judge sets oral
arguments to be
heard on Nov. 6
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
After more than five years of
delays, a former law professor's
lawsuit claiming the University
discriminated against him because
he is gay will face yet another hear-

ing before determining whether it
will go to trial.
During a phone-in hearing Fri-
day afternoon in the 30th Judi-
cial Circuit Court, Judge James
Giddings set oral arguments to
be heard on Nov. 6 regarding a
summary disposition filed by the
University in March 2008, which
requested that the case be thrown
out. The University filed two sum-
mary dispositions for the case in
the past, both of which were denied
by the court.

Former University Law School
Prof Peter Hammer, who now
teaches at Wayne State University,
is suing the University of Michigan
after being denied tenure in 2003.
He claims the Law School's faculty,
motivated by anti-gay prejudice,

door vote.
The hearing Friday addressed
two motions that were initially
filed by the plaintiff, Hammer. The

UCLA student stabbed during chemistry lab

A University of California at
Los Angeles student was stabbed
multiple times in the neck dur-
ing a chemistry lib Thurs-
day afternoon, the Daily Bruin
reported. The victim, who the
newspaper reported is improving,
was a 20-year-old female student
in the class.
Damon Thompson was arrest-
ed for allegedly stabbing the
woman and is being kept in cus-
tody on charges of attempted
murder. Bail has been set at $1
million and the arraignment is
set for tomorrow.
Thompson, a fourth-year UCLA
student, has no criminal history.
He turned himself into the authori-
ties. The Daily Bruin reported that
he is so far cooperating with the
Los Angeles Police Department's
investigation.
Emergency medical techni-
cians took the victim to the UCLA
Medical Center where she was
listed in critical condition. She is
expected to make a full recovery.

Northern Illinois police chief
threatens student journalist
Northern Illinois University's stu-
dent newspaper, the Northern Star,
published an editorial Thursday call-
ing for the dismissal of campus Police
Chief Donald Grady. The editorial
came about after the editor-in-chief
of the paper accused Grady of threat-
ening him if the Northern Star didn't
publish an article placing a former
campus police officer in a positive
light.
Grady allegedly yelled at the stu-
dent for three hours then offered the
student a job if he agreed to write
an article that positively portrayed
Dexter Yarbrough - an officer who
resigned earlier in the year because of
scandal.
Yarbrough acted as the former
police chief at Colorado State Univer-
sity before NIU hired him as an entry-
levelofficer last June. He resigned two
weeks later when it surfaced that CSU
had investigated him multiple times
because of inappropriate conduct.

NIU will investigate Grady in
response to the allegations, the paper
reported.

"By participating in this pro-
gram, our students will develop

their chosen fields and realize their
full potential by becoming leaders

ties," said Vianne Timmons, presi-
dent and vice-chancellor of the
University of Regina, in the press
release.

NEWS BRIEFS
ROCHESTER, Mich.
" Gitmo detainee
debate reignited in
Standish, Mich.
This month's scheduled shutdown
of the Standish Maximum Correc-
tion Facility and the loss of its 300
jobs are giving new impetus to sup-
porters and opponents of housing
Guantanamo Bay inmates there.
Officials in Au Gres and Arenac
County passed resolutions last week
supporting the transfer of the de-
tainees to Standish, about 150 miles
north of Detroit, to temper the eco-
nomic impact of the prison's sched-
uled Oct. 31 closure. The Standish
City Council is expected to vote on a
similar resolution Thursday.
But opponents will hold a forum in
Rochester, near Detroit, at 7 p.m. to-
day torenewtheir arguments against
housing the detainees in Standish.
"Everyone thinks Standish is off
the table, but it's not," Dave Munson
of Standish, a founder of the Michi-
gan Coalition to Stop Gitmo North,
told the Detroit Free Press for a story
published yesterday. "If they bring
those people here, we become the
center of the bull's-eye."
President Barack Obama has
pledged to close the U.S. military
prison in Cuba by January, but ad-
ministration officials recently said
he might miss that target.
WASHINGTON
Key Democrat wants
increase in forces in
Afghanistanwar
The U.S. mission in Afghanistan
is in "serious jeopardy" and needs
more troops to turn the tide against
an increasingly potent Taliban
insurgency, the head of the Senate
Intelligence Committee said yes-
terday, putting her at odds with an
influential Democratic colleague on
military matters
Sen. Dianne Feinstein's views
are more closely aligned with those
of key Republicans than members
of her own party. Sen. Carl Levin,
chairman of Senate Armed Services
Committee, urged a more methodi-
cal approach that begins with craft-
ing a new, comprehensive strategy
for Afghanistan.
"I'm saying at this time, don't send
more combat troops," said Levin,
D-Mich., who wants the emphasis
to be on strengthening Afghanistan's
own security forces so they can bear
a greater share of the security bur-
den.
ButFeinstein,D-Calif.,whose post
gives her access to sensitive informa-
tion about the war's progress, said
delaying the reinforcements also
puts the forces already in Afghani-
stan at greater risk.
WASHINGTON
DNC cancels health
care advertisement
after Dole objects
The Democratic National Com-
mittee is canceling a television ad
touting GOP support for health care
reform after protests from one of the

Republicans mentioned, former Sen-
ate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
The ad quotes a series of Repub-
licans - including California Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, former
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and
former Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy Thompson - say-
ing the health care system needs to
be reformed.
Dole is quoted saying: "I want
this to pass.... We've got to do some-
thing."
The ad then accuses current GOP
congressional leaders as "siding with
the insurance companies" to fight
health care reform.
DETROIT
Eight vacant homes
in Detroit burn
A spokesman for Detroit Mayor
Dave Bing says authorities will thor-
oughly investigate eight suspicious
fires in abandoned homes on the
city's east side.
Spokesman Edward Cardenas said
the fires late Saturday and early yes-
terday underscore the need for the
city to come together to fight arson.
The Detroit News quoted investi-
gators as saying arson is suspected in
each of the fires, which occurred in
an area where such crimes normally
do not occur.
Each year around Halloween,
thousands of volunteers join police,
firefighters and city workers seek to
prevent arsons by patrolling Detroit
neighborhoods during what's been
dubbed "Angels' Night."

Pakistan attacks
show the Taliban

cates at the start of the National Equality March in Washington yesterday.
March on Capitol for gay ri.ghts

Yesterday's attack, the
third in a week,
leaves 20 dead
ISLAMABAD (AP) - A week
of terror strikes across Pakistan,
capped by a stunning assault on
army headquarters, show the Tali-
ban have rebounded and appear
determined to shake the nation's
resolve as the military plans for an
offensive againstthe group's strong-
hold on the Afghan border.
The 22-hour attack on Pakistan's
"Pentagon" in the city of Rawalpin-
di, which ended with 20 dead yes-
terday, was the third terror attack in
a week to shake this nuclear-armed
nation. It demonstrated the mili-
tants' renewed strength since their
leader was killed by a U.S. missile
strike in August and military opera-
tions against their bases.
The U.S. has long pushed Islam-
abad to take more action against
Taliban and al-Qaida militants, who
are also blamed for attacks on U.S.
and NATO troops in Afghanistan,
and the army carried outa success-
ful campaign against the militants
in the Swat Valley in the spring.
But the army had been unwill-
ing to go all out in the lawless tribal

areas along the border that serve as
the Taliban's main refuge. Three
offensives into South Waziristan
since 2001 ended in failure and the
government signed peace deals
with the militants.
On the heels of the Swat vic-
tory, the military launched a cam-
paign of airstrikes on the militants
in Waziristan and in recent weeks
officials said they were preparing a
full offensive there.
That was before the embarrass-
ing attack on army headquarters
bolstered militants' assertions they
are ready to take on the military,
and threatened to deflate the army's
newfound popularity.
In the wake of the seige in
Rawalpindi, the government said
it would not be deterred. The mili-
tary launched two airstrikes Sun-
day evening on suspected militant
targets in South Waziristan, killing
at least five'insurgents and ending a
five-day lull in attacks there, intel-
ligence officials said.
"We are going to attack the ter-
rorists, the miscreants over there
who are disturbing the state and
damaging the peace," Information
Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said.
"Wherever they will be, we will fol-
low them. We will pursue them. We
will take them to task."

Thousands march,
demand Obama allow
gays to serve openly
in military
WASHINGTON (AP) - Thou-
sands of gay rights supporters
marched yesterday from the
White House to the Capitol,
demanding that President Barack
Obama keep his promises to allow
gays to serve openly in the mili-
tary and work to end discrimina-
tion against gays.
Rainbow flags and homemade
signs dotted the crowds filling
Pennsylvania Avenue in front of
the White House as people chant-
ed "Hey, Obama, let mama marry
mama" and "We're out, we're
proud, we won't back down."
Many children were also among
the protesters. A few counter-pro-
testers had also joined the crowd,
which stretched several blocks by
the afternoon.
Jason Yanowitz, a 37-year-old
computer programmer from Chi-
cagoheld his daughter, S-year-old
Amira, on his shoulders. His part-
ner, Annie, had their 2-year-old
son, Isiah, in a stroller. Yanowitz
said more straight people were
turning out to show their support
for gay rights.
"If somebody doesn't have
equal rights, then none of us are
free," he said.
"For all I know, she's gay or
he's gay," he added, pointingto his
children.
Some participants in the

National Equality March woke
up energized by Obama's blunt
pledge to end the ban on gays serv-
ing openly in the military during a
speech to the nation's largest gay
rights group Saturday night.
The chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee said
Sunday that Congress will need to
muster the resolve to change the
"don't ask, don't tell policy" - a
change that the military may be
ready for.
"I think it has to be done in the
right way, which is to get a buy-in
from the military, which I think
is now possible," said Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich.
Obama's political energies
have been focused on two wars,
the economic crisis and health
care reform, though he pledged
"unwavering" commitment even
as he wrestled with those prob-
lems.
March organizer Cleve Jones,
creator of the AIDS Memorial
Quilt and a protege of gay rights
pioneer Harvey Milk, said he had
initially discouraged a rally ear-
lier in the year. But he and oth-
ers began to worry Obama was
backing away from his campaign
promises.
"Since we've seen that so many
times before, I didn't want it to
happen again," he said. "We're rot
settling. There's no such thing as a
fraction of equality."
Unlike the first march in 1979
and others in 1987, 1993 and 2000
that included celebrity perfor-
mances and drew as many as
500,000 people, yesterday's event
was driven by grassroots efforts

and was expected to be more low-
key. Washington authorities don't
disclose crowd estimates at rallies,
though at least several thousand
appeared to be in attendance.
Also among the crowd were a
couple of noteworthy activists:
Cynthia Nixon, a cast member
from HBO's "Sex and the City"
who hopes to marry partner
Christine Marinoni nextyear;and
Judy Shepard, who became an
advocate for gay rights after her
son Matthew was killed because
he was gay.

If you answered "yes" to these questions,
you are a woman or man over the age of 18,
and NOT taking medications, you may be
eligible to participate in studies looking at
stress hormones.
Both studies involve multiple blood draws and
between 2 and 5 study visits of varying length.

for study participation.

of people you want live with. But there's an important option miss-
ing from the checklist: You can't pick the gender of the person with
whom you're going to live. This may change now that University
Housing is finally taking a closer look at offering gender-neutral
housing - a desired but unavailable option for many transgender
students. To accommodate needs of every student, including those
who wish to live with someone of the opposite gender for any rea-
son, the University should offer this option on the next round of

housing application surveys.
Currently, University Housing only con-
siders the needs of transgender students if
they specifically request separate housing
and have had gender reassignment surgery
- which is not the case for many students
who identify as a gender other thn their
birth gender. In April, the Spectrum Center
proposed changing this policy by adding a
gender-neutral housing option in April. And
with recent support from the University's
chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, University Housing is giving it seri-
ous thought.
Transgender students may be a small per-
centage of the campus population, but that's
no excuse for making it difficult for them
to find acceptable housing. Forcing these
students to go beyond the housing survey
to obtain a suitable living arrangement may
discourage them from even trying, alienat-
ing these students from comfort in residence
halls. It's also likely that University Hous-
ing will discover a greater demand among
transgender students for gender-neutral
housing if it includes it in the survey. The
University must accommodate for greater
diversity in its.housing strategy by provid-
ing its transgender students an option that
fits their personal lifestyles.
But gender-neutral housing isn't just for
transgender students. Many other students
may prefer this living arrangement, and
they should be able to bequest it. The idea

Football seating should go to
those who arrive early
TO THE DAILY:
Chris Koslowski has got it right (First come,
first seated, 10/09/2009). At last year's game
against Michigan State, I had to explain to a
pair of Spartans why, despite the magnitude of
the game, the student section was not already
a quarter full an hour before kickoff. First
come, first served seating would reward those
who want to show up early and allow the more
casual fans to still file in and find a seat (and
honestly, if Michigan is playing, there is no bad
seat in the Big House).
I proudly arrive at the Big House two hours
before kickoff each Saturday and, along with
Koslowski, believe the atmosphere in the Big
House would experience a much needed boost
from first come, first served seating. While I
understand some feel seniority is more impor-
tant, it's key to note that a higher class status
doesn't mean you care more about the game than
other students. That way, the fans who want to
come early have the opportunity to sit with stu-
dents like them, rather than spending much of
the second quarter making sure the drunk girl
in front of them doesn't fall and hit her head.
Rewarding students who get to the stadium early
would hopefully cultivate a more dedicated, pas-
sionate and loud atmosphere throughout the
student section, something even the brand new
skyboxes can only hope to aspire to.

Banning the Diag preachers
would violate free speech
TO THE DAILY:
I can't help but take offense at Mr. Pan-
duranga's column (Ban biased speech on Diag,
10/09/2009). In his short time on this Earth, Mr.
Panduranga has learned exactly the opposite les-
sons that history has repeatedly demonstrated to
mankind. I cannot begin to imagine the kind of
dangerous world that Mr. Panduranga insists we
live in - one where "most" speech is protected,

shouldn't - live together isn't the type of
thinking that residence halls should fall vic-
tim to. Ifa student wants to live with some-
one of the opposite gender, that student
should be able to make that choice. And
according to genderblind.org, 36 colleges
across the country have already demon-
strated the feasibility of allowing members
of the opposite sex to live together by enact-
ing gender-neutral housing in their resi-
dence halls.
There are some concerns that this will
empower couples to live together, which
could lead to messy living situations and
increased domestic violence. While this
concern must be treated with the utmost
seriousness, University Housing could over-
come it with training sessions - at orienta-
tion, for instance - that teaches students
how to avoid and diffuse such confronta-
tions. An additional concern is that the
gender-neutral housing could inadvertently
create a predominantly transgender hall
that could be subject to stigma and persecu-
tion. But as long as the'entire student com-
munity is given the option of gender-neutral
housing, there will be plenty of other stu-
dents entering into opposite-sex living
arrangements, offsetting the stigma.
The University of Michigan thinks of
itself as a progressive leader among colleg-
es, but to live up to this label it must join the
dozens of others that let students choose
which gender to live with.
D LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@UMICH.EDU
but certainly not the kind speech that makes one
"uncomfortable" or "insults one's sensibilities"
(or even - banish the thought - speech that vio-
lates some arbitrary University code). Of course,
I'm confident that Mr. Panduranga, having been
installed as the head arbiter of his imaginary
world, would be able to rationally, without bias,
determine exactly what speech is safe for the
mind and what speech is strictly verboten.
No person on this campus, neither the cam-
pus faith zealot nor the neo-Nazi, is nearly as
dangerous as the kind of person Mr. Panduran-
ga holds himself out to be - that is, the kind
of person who openly and without reservation
condemns the freedoms of speech we hold
so closely and defend so fervently. Countless
numbers of enlightened individuals before us
have debated this issue and have consistent-
ly come to the conclusion that speech is an
inalienable right. Our Founding Fathers found
it to be of such importance that it was literally
placed above all rights granted to U.S. citizens.
In fact, they practically considered this truth
to be "self evident," though that evidence was
apparently lost on Mr. Panduranga.
So, in celebration of the rights afforded to me
by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
tion, I offer this to you, Mr. Panduranga: Better
to be only thought of as an idiot before opening
your mouth and confirming it to the world.

ought to apologize to all my read-
ers for wasting your federal tax
dollars. My alleged transgres-
sion? According to
Sen. Tom Coburn t
(R-Oklahoma),
it's because I'm a
political scientist.
In the summer
of 2007, I earned
about $2,300 as a
research assistant
on a project funded PATRICK
by a grant from the
National Science O'MAHEN
Foundation.
But instead of
providing a mea culpa, I will now chal-
lenge my accuser to analyze the evi-
dence behind his argument - as any
good scientist ought to do - and ask
him to quietly drop his charges.
On Wednesday, Coburn introduced
an amendment that would forbid the
NSF from funding any work in politi-
cal science in fiscal year 2010. He sug-
gested that my field's average funding
of $9.13 million a year over the last
decade diverts money from more
important scientific work.
Leaving aside that $9.3 million is
only .15 percent of the $6.9 billion in
funding the NSF received last year,
Coburn's makes numerous misguided
arguments in trying to axe the fund-
ing.
He claims political science isn't
really science and he argues it doesn't
provide a useful service to society like
curing cancer. He also believes media
organizations provide all the political
analysis people need.
On his website, Coburn suggests
"that the political projects funded by
the NSF have little to do with science."
Here, the senator confuses political
science with practical politics. As I tell
my students every semester political
science is the study of politics, not the
advocacy of a political position. The

evidence gained from scientific study,
however, can certainlyinformpolitical
advocacy. Loosely paraphrasing Karl
Popper, a well-regarded philosopher
of science, scientific discovery rests
on two principles: developing a theory
and using data.to test the theory. Like
physicists and biologists, political sci-
entists do botl of these things in their
work.
Take one of the projects that Coburn
disparages as a waste of money in his
analysis: studying the "costs" of vot-
ing, particularly the amounts of time
voters wait in line to vote. Forty years
of research by political scientists has
confirmed that increasing the time
cost of voting tends to lead to declines
invoter turnout.
How do scholars know this? They
theorized that longer amounts of time
waiting in line or tougher registration
rules made it more "costly" to vote by
taking up potential voters' time. To
test thectheory, politicalscientists then
analyzed different voting laws and
waiting times across states and found
that tougher registration laws and lon-
ger waits correlated with lower voter
turnout. The theory held up against
attempts to control for other factors,
like a lack of opposition candidates.
Coburn's second argument suggests
that political science doesn't provide
anythinguseful to society. Let's extend
the example about voting costs. In a
democratic society based on elections,
it seems important to know about how
many voters get to the polls, especially
if some groups of voters, like African-
Americans, have to systematically
wait in longer lines than others. The
University's own Walter Mebane has
done extensive research into this phe-
nomenon and provided expert testi-
mony in court cases about it.
To take other examples, political
scientists also study how to design
political institutions. Let's say you
want a power-sharing government to

mute ethnic or religious conflict in a
divided country, like Iraq. You might
want to know what sorts of ramifica-
tionsvarious sorts of electoral systems
will have on resource distribution. Or
perhaps you want to explore federal-
ism as an alternative to grant minority
groups local governance. Allen Hick-
en, Jenna Bednar and Ken Kollman,
all political scientists at the University,
study those things, often with funding
from the NSF.
Coburn's reasons
to cut funding
are misguided.
Finally, Coburn suggests that the
news media can provide all the politi-
cal analysis we need. But the truth is
that news coverage, while often pro-
viding valuable insight into politics,
generally focuses haphazardly on
short-term developments and not on
recognizing underlying strqctures.
Political scientists are in it for the long
haul.We're not just interested in who's
going to win the current election and
by how much - although our forecast-
ing models do a decent job predicting
that. Rather, we seek to understand
broader questions underlying political
processes.
So after defending the science and
relevance of political science, I'll take
my last few words to engage in selfish
political advocacy: Please encourage
your senators and representatives to
vote "Nay" on Tom Coburn's ignorant
Amendment 2631 to gut political sci-
ence funding.

The bla-me game and Israel

0

As students at an institute of higher learning, we have
the unique opportunity to explore the intricate dynam-
ics involved in international conflicts and resolutions. We
have the chance to consider all sides of a story, expose our-
selves to others' beliefs, and ultimately formulate our opin-
ions after careful examination of the facts.
In a conflict as divisive and deeply rooted as that in the
Middle East, incongruent narratives inevitably emerge
seeking to explain the past, present and expectations for
the future. But these narratives do not operate in polar
black and white terms - indeed, a great deal of gray area
exists between them. Campus discourse often focuses on
different groups exchanging nothing more than opposing
perspectives. The embittered and accusatory battle for
the "right" story creates an atmosphere of mistrust, which
prevents the conversation from progressing beyond simply
laying blame in a situation where neither side is completely
guiltless.
Mike Sayre's viewpoint last Wednesday accused Israel
- and U.S. support for Israel - of being the sole obstacle to
achieving a just and lasting peace (<em>Seeking solutions
in Palestine</em>, 10/07/2009). But this type of biased
attack refuses to acknowledge the Israeli perspective.
An examination of the United Nations' Goldstone
Report provides an example of the importance of critical
analysis in a situation that is seeped in complexity. Since
Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas's per-
petual bombardment of Israel caused physical damage,
injuries and deaths in Southern Israel, as well as constant
fear. In response to Hamas's violation of international law
and unrelenting bombardment of Israel, with 7,000 rocket
attacks since 2005, Israel acted on its right to self-defense
and launched a counter-terrorist operation last winter.
With a terrorist organization controlling the area and
launching rockets from people's homes, the protection
of civilian lives during Israel's attack on Hamas proved
increasingly difficult. Aiming to preserve innocent Pal-
estinian lives, the Israeli Defense Forces took exten-
sive measures to limit civilian casualties. Such measures
included warnings by phone calls, text messages, leaflets
and radio announcements of impending attacks on Hamas
targets. Israel willingly forfeited its strategic advantage to

minimize Palestinian civilian casualties, only to later be
accused of human rights violations.
The accusations levied against Israel by the Goldstone
Report fail to take into account Israel's right to defend itself
according to international law. It serves as an example of
the polarizing approachto the situation standingin the way
of rational analysis. Its purpose was biased and nonobjec-
tive - the "findings" were predetermined and concluded
before the writers actually began their investigation.
The mandate of the Goldstone Commission calls upon
the Human Rights Council to "investigate all violations of
international human rights law and International Human-
itarian Law by the occupying Power, Israel, against the
Palestinian people." The mandate itself was titled "The
Grave Violations of Human Rights in the Occupied Pal-
estinian Territory." This presumption of guilt before an
actual investigation is a severe problem in the protection
of international human rights. This biased and illegitimate
premise undermines the United Nations' ability to safe-
guard human rights.
To learn from the mistakes of the Goldstone Report,
students on campus have an important obligation to come
together and rationally explore the situation's multifaceted
nature. More comprehensive views lead to critical under-
standing and effective discourse. Michigan's campus is an
ideal place to engage in this kind of effective conversation
because of the rich diversity at the University that lends
itself to healthy dialogue.
We hope that our fellow students will make the cru-
cial distinction between pure bias and analysis of facts in
future campus discourse. As we get further into the school
year, we challenge the Michigan student body to educate,
engage in constructive conversations, and avoid the "right"
and "wrong" rhetoric that so often distracts us from pro-
ductive conversation. The question now is what we can do
to help contribute to a peaceful, fair and sustainable solu-
tion to the Middle East conflict, encompassing aHl views
and sides of the story.

chair of American Movement for Israel and a board

Hit it and quit it

When you devote your-
self to television
fandom, you open up
a vulnerable spot in your heart.
You give a little
piece of your
emotional well-
being to a TV
series, and you
expect that it
will be nur-
tured and kept
safe. Like with JAM IE
any relation- BLOCK
ship, the more your
televised partner supports you,
the closer a bond you will form.
But also like with any relation-
ship, when trust is betrayed for too
long, there comes a time to call the
whole thing off.
I recently sat down for coffee
with "Heroes" to discuss just that.
I was worried it wouldn't return
my calls since it has been neglect-
ing viewer feedback for so long,
but eventually the show called me
back and we agreed to meet. And
as we took our seats that fateful
day, I could tell from the tears in
its eyes that the show knew what
was happening: We were finally
breaking up.
Back in season one, everything
in our relationship had seemed
so great. The "Heroes" plot was
just developing, the characters
had depth and the show held me
close, captivating me with twists
and turns. It was puppy love at its
televised best. But as I reminisced
about the good times, bracing
"Heroes" for the final blow, people
started to stare. Then again, it's not
surprising. "Heroes" has really let
itself go.
Season two was a rough patch,
but I thought it was something we
would get past. "Heroes" acknowl-
edged it was losing its flair and
becoming bloated with unneces-
sary sideplots, but it said it was
going to work to get back on track.
So while I went on to apologize
for my flaws in the relationship -
watching it online instead of when
it aired - I could see "Heroes"
wasn't buying my remorse, and
rightly so. "Heroes" knew it was,
fully at fault. It promised no more
time travel! It promised!
Butthis is when "Heroes," like
anyone who sees it's about nolose
something dear to it, got aggres-
sive. It started to berate me, citing
its many changes for the better,

actually comes
together, manages to be somewhat
funny. Unfortunately, more often
than not, too much of the film
relies on blandness and cheap sight
gags.
The story revolves around four
couples: Dave and Ronnie (Vince
Vaughn, "Wedding Crashers" and
Malin Akerman, "Watchmen"),
Jason and Cynthia (Jason Bate-
man, "Hancock" and Kristen Bell,

"Forgetting Sarah Marshall"),
Joey and Lucy (Jon Favreau, "I

Naturally, by the end of the film
there are startling revelations, the

inevitable reconciliations in which
all past problems are forgotten.
But until then, the couples will
participate in bizarre trust-build-

There are some fairly funny
moments during the therapy,
including an uncomfortable yoga
experience with an incredibly

Tonight's fright

Don't fly with FedEx. Apparently these suckers never saw 'Cast Away.'

COUPLES RETREAT
From Page 5A
they've proven it before numerous times. The problem
here is that they've been handed mediocre material
and were unable to transform it into anything more.
It's a real surprise that this script was written
by Vaughn and Favreau, who should both be able
to write better jokes in their sleep. The problem is
these two men are stuck playing the same character

over and over again. And, while it's still somewhat
funny, it's also getting old. It'll be interesting to see
if they ever realize that maybe it's time to stop rely-
ing on what worked in the past and take some more
chances.
A film like "Couples Retreat" is a pleasant but for-
gettable experience, which isn't always necessarily a
horrible thing. But, for a film that seems to have a lot
of potentially great elements going for it, we are left to
wonder what might have been. Either way, these actors
will recover and will go on to make more (and, hope-
fully, funnier) films.

A low budget turns
in big scares and
a few big laughs in
'Paranormal Activity'
ByJENNIFERXU
Daily Arts Writer
If you're thinking about watch-
ing "Paranormal Activity," do it
- but do it right:
Wait in line for
hours to catch a
midnight screen-
ing; sit down in Pranona
a packed theater Aff
with no legroom
whatsoever At the State
and strangers Paramount
breathing down
your neck; laugh
when the girl in the front row
screamswhenthedoorstartssway-
ing; grumble to your friends about
when the "scary stuff" is going to
start; laugh again. Relax, you can
handleit.And thenscream. Scream
like you never have before while
the guy next to you starts hyper-
ventilating uncontrollably. Scream
because your heart feels like it has
just dropped to the ground and
your mouth doesn't know what else
to do. You want to cover your eyes,
but you can't. You want to leave the
theater, but you can't. All you can
do is scream. If this sounds a tad.
exaggerated, go watch "Paranor-
mal Activity" tonight.
"Paranormal Activity" returns
to the essence of what a horror
movie should be: Without back-
stories and supernatural special
effects, it's a low-low-budget
($11,000, to be exact) movie with
a straightforward plot that can
still pull you in and never let go.
The film has become a nation-
wide phenomenon, advertising
itself as "the scariest movie since
'The Exorcist,' " but it lies in dif-
ferent territory than its supposed
predecessor. Rather than provid-

Just like watching scrambled porn, but with more ghosts.


GHOST LAB
From Page 5A
event led to the creation of the group Everyday Para-
normal - a club in which the members search for
ghosts and wear shirts that say "Everyday Paranor-
mal" on the back. From the seeds of Everyday Paranor-
mal, the concept of "Ghost Lab" was sprung.
The extreme lengths the brothers go to while
attempting to locate paranormal activity are amus-
ing, despite being (and possibly because they are so)
absurd. For instance, the cast goes to the Shreve-
port Municipal Auditorium - the famed spot where
Elvis began his music career - and begins to per-
form rockabilly songs in order to coax any linger-
ing spirits out of hiding. Later in the first episode,
the' gang travels to Myrtles Plantation ("one of
America's most haunted homes") and plays record-
ings of people reading Civil War-era letters. These
methods have dubious results, but any blip on the
radar or whispered voice is met with jubilation: The
brothers high-five and hug each other at anything
that's slightly out of the ordinary. Their reactions in
their ghost search are much more entertaining than

the ghost search itself, primarily because they never
find anything real, yet their reactions are always so
joyous.
Adding to the failure are the faux-scientific inter-
ludes, wedged into "Ghost Lab" at random points
seemingly in an attempt to establish academic cred-
ibility. Long shots of the "investigators" bending over
complicated-looking scientific equipment and urgently
discussing deviations in their instruments are a con-
stant in "Ghost Lab." When Brad and Barry seem on
the verge of discovering the ghost of a dead child, the
last thing anyone wants is an interruption to explain
the parallel universe theory of quantum physics. And
nobody wants to see an interview with a random his-
tory professor as he reviews the Civil War in excru-
ciating detail; while possibly informative, it's related
tangentially at best to riding around in an oversized
car hauler searching for ghosts.
But the show's biggest flaw is its utter inability to
achieve competence as a piece of documentary work,
in large part because there are no clear signs of para-
normal activity throughout it. And it's not even amus-
ing enough to watch simply to mock. While the concept
is interesting, the coupling of complete inactivity with
pompous academic explanations leads toa "Ghost Lab"
that blinds its viewers with failure.

ing any sort of religious expo-
sition, "Paranormal Activity"
jumps right into the action, rely-
ing solely on scare value. There's
a genuine tension in this film -
the kind that builds up drop by
drop until, all of a sudden, the
terror practically explodes out of
the screen. In this effect, "Para-
normal Activity" is highly suc-
cessful at what it sets out to do:
scare the shit out of you.
It's nearly impossible to explain
any aspect of plot in this film
without giving too much away. In
a nutshell, a couple moves into a
new house and tries to investigate
the "paranormal activities" going
on around them: faucets turning
on, light bulbs flickering, doors
spontaneously shutting, etc. They
hypothesize a demon might some-
how be linked to these events.Pan-
demonium ensues.
The movie is filmed with the
worst camerawork known to man,
which makes it all the more con-
vincing. Like its spiritual precur-
sor "The Blair Witch Project,"
"Paranormal Activity" adopts a
documentary style that makes
viewers half-believe these events
are actually happening. And like
"Blair Witch," there isn't a lot of
gore involved. The movie gets by
with few special effects and little
blood, proving that imagination

can be much more powerful than
visuals.
The film's greatest attribute.
is that it's actually funny, so
while audiences are waiting for
the climax to poke its head out,
they can laugh, too. The main
character plays comically pedes-
trian supernatural music before
the psychic arrives. When the
psychic tells the couple that the
demon feeds off negative energy,
he quips: "We shouldn't let your
mother come over anymore."
However, the humor is onlythere
to lull moviegoers into a sense of
complacency - make no mistake:
Many will scream, and they will
scream loud.
Thankfully, these deep-set
fears will not last long after the
movie experience. Essentially,
"Paranormal Activity"will scare,
but it won't scar. Having arrived
home, most viewers will still be
able to climb into their bed, turn
off the lights (except maybe one
distant desk lamp, just in case)
and not have nightmares. The
previously ghastly images -will
fade away into a distant memory.
That is exactly the kind of movie
"Paranormal Activity" is: a neat
little horror movie packaged in
an easily disposable case- - ulti-
mately satisfying, but relievingly
forgettable.

Study: Law-related experience
not required to get into law school

Work experience just
one of many criteria,
according to Kaplan
Test Prep report
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
Jeff Carroll, a first-year law
student at the University, took his
LSAT practice test at a Marriott
Hotel in New Orleans on New
Year's Eve, the night before the
2007 Sugar Bowl. Carroll was cov-
ering Notre Dame football for the
South Bend Tribune, a job he had
held for about a decade.
Carroll had no previous law-
related work experience, but after
10 years on the road covering Notre
Dame football, and talks of starting
a family with his wife, Carroll decid-
ed to take a crack at law school.
Contrary to what many under-
graduates may believe, the fact that
Carroll had never interned at a law
firm and had spent the last decade
in a completely unrelated field
didn't put him at a disadvantage in
the admissions process.
According to a Kaplan Test Prep
and Admissions survey of 152 law
school admissions officers released
last week, more than half of those
surveyed reported thathaving legal
work experience doesn't give an
advantage in admissions.
"What's clear from our survey is
that admissions officers continue to
consider an applicant's LSAT score
to be the most important admis-
sions factor," Howard Bell, execu-
tive director of pre-law programs
at Kaplan wrote in a press release
regarding the study, "followed by
undergraduate GPA, the personal
statement, letters of recommenda-
tion and professional experience."
"While this news should not dis-
courage applicants from interning
or working in the legal profession
prior to law school," Bell wrote,
"they should understand its rela-
tive insignificance in comparison to

LETTER
From Page1A
"I belong to dozens of organiza-
tions where the membership isn't
always in full alignment on all
issues, and this is no exception,"
Coleman wrote in the statement.
"The issues surrounding this
year's budget are very serious, and
they will continue to be so next year
and beyond," she continued. "It is
in the best interests of the state to
look to the long term and focus on
the highest priorities - including
higher education - as we lay the
groundwork forthe future."
In an e-mail to the Daily, Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzger-
ald wrote that Coleman "did not
know about the letter before it
was sent."
The letter expresses disappoint-
ment over the legislature's failure
to pass a budget for the fiscal year
2009-2010 by the Oct. 1 deadline,
and recommends the adoption of a
budgetagreementreachedbetween
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Bishop (R-Rochester) and House
Speaker Andy Dillon (D-Redford
Twp.), according to a copy obtained
by The Associated Press.
Under the terms of that agree-
ment, the Michigan Promise Schol-
arship would be eliminated.
The Promise Scholarship pro-
gram provides money to more than
96,000 Michigan college students
that can total anywhere from $500
to $4,000 over four years.

A merit examination given in
high schools determines students'
eligibilityforthe grants.
Fitzgerald told the Daily last
month that an estimated 6,096 stu-
dents at the University of Michigan
would benefit from the program
this academic year.
As lawmakers race to pass a bud-
get already more than a week over-
due, quarrels over how to close the
deficitgap leave the Promise Schol-
arship hanging inthe balance, with
the Republican-controlled Senate
moving to cut programs and the
Democrat-controlled House look-
ing for ways to increase revenues,
like raising certain taxes.
In the letter, Rothwell is more
sympathetic to the Republican phi-
losophy. He writes, "we discour-
age the adoption of any revenue
enhancements or tax increases,
including the closure of 'tax loop-
holes,' to solve the budget deficit.
Any tax increase would be another
temporarysolutiontothelong-term
structural budgetproblems we face
and would continue to prevent
Michigan's economic revival."
The letter first surfaced in a
Detroit Free Press report Thurs-
day afternoon.
Noren told the paper that the
letter did not reflect Wayne State's
position and was not approved by
him. The report also said Simon
"sent aletterindicatingshe also was
opposed to (the letter's) contents."

SAID ALSALAH/Daily
Officials from the University's Law School Admissions Office say work experience not make-or-break for an applicant.

other admission factors."
Though the Kaplan press release
states that many people may have
previously thought that having
law-related work experience would
give them an edge in getting into
law school, some students at the
University of Michigan Law School
were already aware that working
in the legal field before applying
wasn't a make-or-break factor.
Before applying to law school,
University law student Zach Dembo
worked for Teach for America, an
organization that places college
graduates as instructors in impov-
erished rural and urban centers.
Dembo said that while he had
heard that it was important totake
some time off between undergrad-
uate work and law school, he said
he didn't think having law-related
experience was a necessity, and
that it had turned off some people
that he knevw from applying to law
school.
Sarah Zearfoss, assistant dean
and director of admissions at the
Law School, wrote in an e-mail
interview that while the University

didn't participate in the survey, she
agrees with the results.
Zearfoss wrote in the e-mail that
the Law School tends to admit can-
didates with a wide range of expe-
riences and that working in the law
field before applying may be ben-
eficial because it can help a student
to decide if law school is the right
path for them.
"We certainly like to see that
people have had meaningful work
experience ... but it need not be
law-related in particular," Zearfoss
wrote. "That said, I think it can
be advantageous to the candidate
... to gather some experience with
the world of law before making the
decision to embark on it asa career,
in order to get a clear idea of the
experience and expectations."
Though havinglaw-related expe-
rience might not be a factor in get-
ting in to law school, students said
it certainly brings a level of famil-
iarity and background to the field.
John Calvin worked as a courier
for 15 years at Detroit-based law
firms Butzel Long and Dickinson
Wright before becoming a student

at the Law School. His motivation
for working at these firms wasn't to
gain experience for law school, but
just to earn a living so he could play
music at night in loctl clubs.
"I think a lot of people get a job at
a law firm because they want to go
to law school, so they do it in that
order," Calvin said. "Mine was a
job at a law firm and that made me
want to go to law school."
He said that being around legal
documents and attorneys gave him
the background in legal language
and procedure, and enabled him
to have reference points during
class.
Although Carroll hasn't worked
in the journalism field for years,
he believes that what he learned
covering Notre Dame football has
directly helped him in law.
"Maybe the background knowl-
edge isn't the same as someone who
spent time in a law office,".he said,
"but I guess the main point is there
are other skills you can learn doing
otherjobs that are outside that field
that can give you some skills that
can pay off in law school."

Lawmakers balance business tax with public needs

From Page 1A
that involve increasing taxes and
repealing tax credits in order to fill
the holes left in the pending budget
for the 2010 fiscal year.
In general, the Republican-con-
trolled Senate has favored cutting
state programs as a solution, while
the Democrat-controlled House is
looking for ways to increase rev-
enues, like raising certain taxes.
Last week, the House passed three
revenue-raising bills with provisions
to increase taxes on physicians by 3
percent, freeze the personal income
tax exemption and eliminate credits
that allow companies to avoid the
Michigan Business Tax.
Rep. George Cushingberry Jr.
(D-Detroit), chair of the House
Appropriations Committee, intro-
duced one of these bills, House Bill
5384. Cushingberry said that by
making the Michigan Business Tax
applicable to more companies, the
bill would raise funds for programs
like the Michigan Promise Scholar-
ship, which would be cut under the
current proposed budget.
Inaninterview,Cushingberrysaid
that in this situation, he disagrees
with acommonnotioninpoliticsand
economics that by increasing taxes
on businesses, lawmakers hurt the
state's appeal to companies. Cush-
ingberry said that cutting Michigan
Business Tax credits wouldn't be a
hindrance to business in the state,
as lessthan 10 percentofa business's
decision to open its doors is based on
tax credits.
"That is one of the minimal fac-
tors," he said. "It's a spurious argu-
ment."
LizBoyd, press secretaryforGov.
Jennifer Granholm, said Granholm
supports the bill, which would
generate more than $116 million in
revenue for important state-funded
programs.
"Gov. Granholm believes that
Michigan's future demands a bud-
get that helps us diversify our
economy, attract new investments
and creates new jobs," Boyd said.

all year. It was a "blackout" night
game broadcast on national TV in
a stadium with about a foot and a
half Between the bench a'nd the
first row of fans. And there was a

to when the Wolverines played in
East Lansing.
So there must have been some-
thing there - even though Rodri-
guez kept returning to the same
point: "Don't start off trying to
create something that's not there."
There's no one that wants to win
more than the head coach, and that
was clear when Rodriguez reluc-
tantly and at first hastily answered
questions about the quarterback
decision. For the first time this
season, neither quarterback was
allowed to speak to the media.
But I don't know what that
"something" was.
Maybe something happened in
practice or a film session during the
week. Maybe Forcier's head just
grew too big, too quickly. Or maybe
Forcier talked back to. Rodriguez

was screaming at him (or coach-

ask) on national television.
But why would Rodriguez, who
wants to win more than anyone
else, teach his comeback quar-
terback a lesson with 90 seconds
remaining in a game against the
No.12 team in the country?
Perhaps Rodriguez was in a bad
mood and let it cloud his decision
making - he was visibly angry at
multiple players on the sideline,
including redshirt freshmen J.T.
Floyd and Roy Roundtree. But you
don't notch 112 career wins as a
head coach if you let anger get in
the way.
One explanation is that Forci-
er was just playing poorly and
Rodriguez felt more confident

"Michigan's future demands a bud-
get that keeps police officers and
firefighters on the job and on our
streets, and that helps our children
afford a college education and pro-
tects people at risk during these
tough economic times."
But many GOP lawmakers, like
Rep. Dave Agema (R-Grandville)
disagree.
Agema said the Michigan Busi-
ness Tax is both a deterrent for
businesses looking to open shop in
the state and a strain on existing
businesses. Taxing during a reces-
sion only exacerbates poor econom-
ic conditions, he added.
"The Michigan Business Tax is
one of the most onerous taxes in
any state," Agema said. "Businesses
need to come here and hire people.
That's how we're going to get our
way out of this recession. And that's
going to have to be a profitable
place for businesses to come, both
in regulation and in taxes. Right
now we're not that state."
The bill was passed in the form
of a shell bill, according to Rep. Bill
Rogers (R-Brighton). This prac-
tice allows lawmakers to get a bill
passed while postponing the cre-
ation of specific details, Rogers
said.
"(The) shell bill is a lot of posi-
tioning by both parties to get ulti-
mate goals, which in many cases,
we as legislators, aren't privy to,"
Rogers said.
Rod Byrne, former chair of the
Ann Arbor Area Chamber of Com-
merce, said C-corporations who file
underthe fiscalyear,whichincludes
many manufacturers, would be
most affected by a decrease in tax
credits under the Michigan Busi-
ness Tax.
Though the clear top priority of
state legislators is to create a bal-
anced budget, they also need to
think about the state's long-term
economic goals, Byrne said.
"Right now the goal seems to be
very focused on balancing the bud-
get but if you see economic growth
as a means of long-term balancing
in Robinson leading the offense.
Forcier was having his worst sta-
tistical game of the season, going
8-for-19 with an interception and
a fumble. But he wasn't exactly
making a case for the Heisman
Trophy before he led game-tying
drive against Michigan State.
The most plausible explanation
might be what happened on Forci-
Uer's last orrives
After Michigan's flimsy defense
came up with its biggest stop of the
game - a fourth-down goal-line
stand on the one-yard line - with
nearly 13 minutes remaining, there
was a huge momentum shift.
Forcier took over, standing in
his own end zone. First and second
down went for zero yards. Then, on
third down, with one tick left on
the play clock, the offense was bla-
tantly out of whack. Center David
Moosman snapped the ball through
the back of the end zone as running
back Brandon Minor called Michi-
gan's second timeout so the unit
could collect itself. No one seemed
to know what was going on.
The decision to use a timeout
then was critical. The clock wasn't
moving, and the Wolverines would
have been penalized half the dis-

budgets, you need to find ways to
get businesses to come to the state
of Michigan," Byrne said. "Having
a high or difficult-to-manage or
difficult-to-plan-for business tax is
not a way to do that."
Businesses, initially discour-
aged by the proposal to eliminate
the Michigan Business Tax credit,
were greeted with more optimistic
news for business taxes late Thurs-
day night in the legislature's other
chamber. The state Senate passed a
bill close to midnight that created a
plan to generate funds for the K-12
budget, while also getting rid of the
Michigan Business Tax surcharge.
This proposed repeal of the
22-percent surcharge will greatly
help struggling businesses in the
state, according to Jim Holcomb,
vice president of Business Advo-
cacy and associate general counsel
for the Michigan Chamber of Com-
merce.
"(It) will have a great impact on
economic growth in the state of
Michigan," Holcomb said. "(It will)
help provide jobs, help reduce (the)
unemployment rate ... (It) really
took a positive step for Michigan."
The package of bills passed in
the Senate will modify some of
the credits under the Michigan
Business Tax, which will create
additional revenue to allow for the
phase-out of the surcharge over
three years, Holcomb said.
The phasing out of the Michi-
gan Business Tax surcharge
would cost the state about $159
million, according to Rep. Joan
Bauer (D-Lansing).
Mike Johnston, vice presi-
dent for Government Affairs for
the Michigan Manufacturers
Association, said the various tax
increases in the bill would offset
the decrease in revenue from the
repeal of the surcharge.
But Johnston said Michigan
businesses, especially manufac-
turers - which make up the larg-
est sector of the state's economy
- "truly appreciate" the proposed
removal of the surcharge.
tance to the goal line - just a half of
a yard --ifthey were called for delay
of game. On the replay of the down,
Forcier heaved a bomb into double
coverage that fell incomplete.
There was clearly some miscom-
munication or misunderstanding
going on with Forcier on the field.
On his next drive, Michigan was
called for a delay of game on first
down and the Wolverines were
forced to punt three plays later.
Robinson came in on the next
possession, and then Rodriguez
pulled Forcier off the field for the
final drive - potentially the game-
winning one.
"As the head coach, I can do
that," Rodriguez said snarkily. "We
can decide what we want to do."
But this isn't West Virginia,
where the Mountaineers are only
relevant when they win. At Michi-
gan, winning, and especially los-
ing, is always a big deal.
We all know Robinson's "spark"
was not the only reason Forcier
didn't take the field on Michigan's
final drive.
So what was it, Rich Rod?
- Eisenstein can be reached
at mseisen@umich.edu.

Boyd said Granholm's proposed
budget includes the removal of the
surcharge.
"The Governor has proposed a
balanced budget that funds our pri-
orities and she has also proposed a
solution for phasing out the MBT
surcharge, which is a priority for
the business community," Boyd
said.
Michigan was ranked No. 49 on
Forbes' 2009 list of "The Best States
for Business" and holds the No. 50
spot for both the economic climate
and growth prospects ranks.
Holcomb said the Michigan Busi-
ness Tax could use clarification on
a number of technical points that
will affect business owners.
"If we get this active, it will
repeal the surcharge but there still
are other issues with many busi-
nesses across the state," Holcomb
said. "It's certainly far from a per-
fect tax."
The Senate bill now moves to the
House for deliberation.
According to Bauer, the House
has "a number of concerns" with
the proposal, including the suspen-
sion of the earned income tax cred-
it, which helps the working poor.
"There has to be more study
of this so we think that this way
to raise revenue makes sense for AL GOLDIs/AP
Michigan," Bauer said. The moon rises over the dome of the state Capitol building on Sept. 30.

Prof. Hammer hopes for
quick decision in lawsuit

BOWL GAME ASPIRATIONS

on the University's summary dis-
position filed in March 2008. The
second moved to enforce protec-
tive orders, which would keep
details of the case private. Neither
party has been following the pro-
tective orders thus far in the pro-
ceedings.
The motion to enforce the pro-
tective orders over the case was
postponed indefinitely by the
court, which neither party pro-
tested.
Giddings placed a new protec-
tive order on certain details of the
case duringthe hearing on Friday,
which both parties intend to fol-
low. The information under this
protective order will remain under
wraps until the summary hearing
in November.
Though unwilling to speak
about intimate details of the case,
Hammer expressed relief over the

decision to move the case along.
"I'm very happy the court has
scheduled a hearing date," Ham-
mer said. "Hopefully the court will
determine.that this matter can be
set for trial.
"I'm hoping by getting this
thing all geared up again, we can
anticipate a decision shortly after
the hearing."
The filing of the lawsuit came
after Hammer was denied ten-
ure in 2003. Hammer had been
approved for tenure by a review
board for the University by a 4-1
vote, but his tenure was denied
when tenured Law School faculty
voted 18-12, two votes shy of the
two-thirds vote required to be
granted tenure.
Hammer left the University
shortly after being denied tenure
and filed a lawsuit against the Uni-
versity in 2004, alleging he was
discriminated against because of
his sexuality, which would violate

the University's non-discrimina-
tion policies.
The University initially argued
that an alleged violation of Univer-
sity policy could notbe pursued in a
legal setting, but changed its argu-
ment in 2006 due to pressure from
faculty. Since then, the University
has shifted strategy, instead argu-
ing that discrimination had no role
in Hammer's tenure decision.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham, while unable to
discuss the University's legal
strategy, said the University does
its best to ensure that discrimi-
nation does not occur within the
community.
"The University is committed
to inclusiveness and non-discrimi-
nation for all members of our com-
munity," Cunningham said in an
e-mail. "The university has bylaws
and policies, and entire systems in
place to make sure those policies
are working properly."

first race as a member of the Michi-
gan men's swimming and diving
team. The competition in the first
three legs of the relay were tight,
and by the time he entered the
water, his three relay teammates
had given him a narrow lead of just
over a second and a half.
With the other swimmers in
his lane rooting for him behind
the blocks and his coaches and
teammates screaming and cheer-
ing on the pool deck, Gregg not
only maintained that lead, but
increased it by over three seconds
to secure first place and set a new
meet record.
It was an impressive start to the
meet for the Wolverines and hope-
fully a glimpse of what they can
expect to see from this season's

freshmen class.
This year, Michigan has 16
freshmen, which represents just
less than half the team and is the
largest in the program's 88-year
history. Friday night was the first
chance for coaches and upperclass-
men to see the freshmen perform
in a competitive situation. By the
end of the meet, nine freshmen had
scored points for Michigan.
The meet was hosted by Notre
Dame and featured all relay events.
It was Michigan's first competi-
tion of the year, and the Wolverines
took first place by winning every
swimming event and outscoring
the Irish by 32 points. Oakland,
Valparaiso and Cleveland State also
participated.
"For me it was really nice to see
the guys were workingtogether and
appreciated each other's efforts,"
Michigan assistant coach Josh
White said. "It was a great way to
introduce our freshmen to Michi-
gan and a great way for our upper-

Notjust wins and losses
on the line Saturday

The Big House
streak of 100,000-
plus fans could
be at stake
Iunderstand Football Satur-
days are a lot easier td get
excited about when ,e team
is winning games. Of course,
you'd rather see the Wolverines
play Notre Dame, Penn State or
Ohio State. And we all know with
Fall Break days
away, many of
you are plan-
ning to go
home or visit
friends at other
schools around
the country.
I get it. But ANDY
you should REID
delay those _
plans until Sat-
urday evening
and go watch Michigan demolish
Delaware State in the Big House.
You don't even have to stay
for the whole thing - if the Wol-
verines are up by 30 in the third
quarter and you've had enough
of "The Wave" after it's already
traveled five times around the
bowl, then feel free to get a head
start with your break plans.
Just come.
Have a good time at a game
which, if everything goes to
plan, Michigan will make quick
and easy work of a totally mis-
matched opponent, shake off

the two recent losses and push
forward toward a strong finish
through the meat of the Big Ten
schedule. Then you can proceed
with your Fall Break festivities.
I'm writing this column
because I'm legitimately con-
cerned that Michigan Stadium's
streak of consecutive games with
100,000-plus fans in attendance
is in jeopardy. Not because the
majority of the stadium won't
show up - just the students,
which might think they have bet-
ter places to be during the first
full day of Fall Break.
For 220 consecutive games in
the Big House, at least 100,000
people have flocked to the corner
of Stadium and Main.
Honestly, this is one of the
most impressive fan- and stadi-
um-related records in the coun-
try, and, at an average of seven
home games a season, it would
take Michigan more than 31 years
to reach that plateau again. It
would be completely the fault
of the students, supposedly the
most rabid and dedicated fans, if
the streak fell.
Last Wednesday, I asked a
member of the Michigan Athletic
Department about the potential
problem. He looked at me like I
was crazy - it's been a long, long
time since anyone associated
with Michigan football has been
worried about that.
But he also admitted that he
hadn't thought of the potential
problem that Fall Break pre-
sented. And there are plenty of
reasons students might skip this

game for other plans. I mean,
the Hornets are bad - really
bad. Unlike Appalachian State in
2007, which was one of the most
dominant Football Championship
Subdivision teams ever, there's
nothing about Delaware State
in particular that could get you
excited about seeing them play.
The Hornets lost 9-7 last week-
end to Bethune Cookman, ateam
that was winless until then. This
might as well be a bye week. But
be there. After all; you only have
four more chances to see the
Wolverines in the Big House this
year.
And even if you're not con-
cerned about the streak - think
about what message you're send-
ing to the team if a third of the
student section is empty for
the game. Especially after two
straight close losses, the student
section is the most important fac-
tor in home-field advantage; and
it would be a huge morale booster
for the team to see you come
out in full force for a less-than-
stellar game.
I'm not trying to call you all
out, because for the most part,
the student section has been
excellent this season. You guys
are crazy and definitely louder
than in years past.
It would just be a shame if the
Michigan Stadium announcer
had to restart the tally at one
starting at next weekend's Penn
State game.

NANOOKS
From page 18
it was facing a stingy Nanook
defense that wasn't going to give
them a lot of room.
"You've got to make your chanc-
es count, because goals are precious
against them," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said Oct. 6.
The turning point in the game
came when Michigan junior defen-
seman Chad Langlais was called
for holding 7:34 into the second
period. Alaska couldn't convert on
the power play, but an unsuccessful
Michigan line change at the end of
the man advantage led to an open
shot for Chad Gehon, who put the
Nanooks up, 1-0.
Alaska added another goal in
the third period when Joe Sova
launched a slap shot past the glove
side of Michigan junior goalie
Bryan Hogan.

"The first goal of the game was
really important," Berenson said.
"And Fairbanks, when they got it,
they milked it pretty good. They
played good (defense). And when
they got the second one, that's all
they need.
"We're a team that has to get
something going. And when we
score we get a little better momen-
tum, like any team. But we couldn't
get that going."
Berenson wasn't pleased with
the Wolverines' sloppy passing and
poor execution on offense. The unit
had multiple isolated attacks and
even outshot the Nanooks 23-13,
but Michigan couldn't sustain any
pressure on Alaska goalie Scott
Greenham.
"It's frustrating," senior cap-
tain Chris Summers said. "They're
a solid, shutdown team. You give
them a lot of credit. But we got to
work through that. We've got to
learn to pull out a victory in those

types of situations."
Saturday's win over Alaska-
Anchorage was just the opposite
for the Wolverines, where they
scored early and often. Michi-
gan gained the momentum when
junior Ben Winnett stole the
puck from the Seawolves' goalie
in the first period, who was han-
dling it behind the net. Winnett
then played it off of a Seawolves
defender for the team's first goal
of the season.
"We played harder on the puck,
and when you do that, you get your
breaks," Berenson said. "We were a
different team (Saturday)."
Five different Wolverines scored
and the defense did its part, forcing
Hogan to make just 15 saves.
"Our veteran players, they
now got a feel for this (Michigan)
team," Berenson said. "Now, we're
not going to win the Stanley Cup
because we won one game, but it's
a good sign."

Michigan had just two power

title in impressive fashion, domi-
nating four matches in three days,
all in straight sets.
With her help, the Michigan

The Wolverines absolutely

By FELIX CARREON
Daily Sports Writer
For fifth-year senior Emily
Brunemann, the return to the pool
Friday was met with great relief.
It had been 566 days since her last
meet as a member of the Michigan
women's swimming and diving
team, where she stood atop the
podium at the 2008 NCAA Cham-
pionships to accept her award for
her first-place finish in the 1,650-
yard freestyle.
Last season, Brunemann was
ruled ineligible to compete for
the Wolverines after she took
what she thought was a laxa-
tive but was actually a banned
diuretic. The NCAA champion
began a voluntary sentence prior
to the 2008-09 season and then
received a six-month suspen-
sion from competition. by the
American Arbitration Associa-
tion (AAA). Brunemann had her
eligibility reinstated after it was
determined that the substance
couldn't have improved her per-
formance and its use couldn't
have been used to mask other
banned substances.
It didn't take long for Brun-
emann to make a splash at the
meet. In just the second event of
Saturday's dual meet, Brunemann
captured the 1,000-yard freestyle
event title. Brunemann's main
competition was from her team-
mate, senior Emily Hanson, who
finished in second place. Brun-

the only two-person event, DeJong
and freshman Ryan Feely teamed
up for a time of 9:16.39, more than

Cleveland State.
The all-relay format of the meet
provided the coaches with more
opportunities to help correct some

of the early-season mistakes in
areas like starts and flip turns.
White was pleased with the desire
the team showed for improvement
after each swim.
"A number of the guys came
over looking for feedback and then
applied that in their next race,"
White said. "It was good to have
that opportunity because we've

worked on things in practice, but
there's always that extra step of
taking that practice and applying
it in meets and you can't expect
everyone to be perfect the first
time."
In addition to the chance for
the team to make technical and
stroke adjustments, swimming in
all relays allowed the freshmen to

see their first collegiate action in
an environment with a little less
pressure than a dual meet.
"Everyone just had a lot of fun,"
Gregg said. "It was a nice way to
ease into the season, especially for
freshmen who have never compet-
ed in college. The relay format was
great for camaraderie and helping
us really feel a part of the team."

IOWA CITY - Iowa's defensive
rushing statistics were impressive
enough to scare some teams away.
Quarters without allowing a
rushingtouchdown: 33. That's 337
days, eight games and a lot of frus-
trated opponents.
The 30-28 outcome wasn't in
the Wolverines' favor, but they
quickly managed to render the
Hawkeyes' defensive streak irrel-
evant.
Michigan found an answer to
Iowa's stalwart
rushing defense NOTEBOOK
in senior tail-
back Brandon
Minor. With two rushing touch-
downs, Minor kept the Wolver-
ines in the game when its passing
attack couldn't get off the ground.
"I told him he's on national TV,
and you've got to go out there and
show them what you're all about,"
Michigan running backs coach
Fred Jackson said. "You've got to
prove to the people throughout
this country that you're one of
the top backs in this country, and
that's what he was trying to do."
Minor's numbers don't indicate
that he's one of the best backs in
the country (4.8 yards per carry,
good for No. 428 in the nation).
But in his limited opportunities
this season, he's proven himself as
one of the country's most physical
backs.
Minor has been limited this
season with a nagging ankle inju-
ry and he has recorded more than
10 carries in just two other games.
But Saturday, Minor's ankle
looked like it hadn't been an issue.
The Wolverines managed to
score 28 points against a team
that has allowed just 13.6 points
per game entering Saturday, and
Minor was a huge contributor.
He finished with 95 yards on 22
carries and sacrificed his body
on nearly every play. The Iowa
defense allowed a third rush-
ing touchdown late in the fourth
quarter, when freshman quarter-
back Denard Robinson scored on
the Wolverines' second-to-last
desperation drive.
On Robinson's score, Minor
used his physicality to provide a
huge block near the goal line. It's
that physicality that has earned
him rave reviews, even when
he's been injured. On his second
touchdown drive, Minor carried

Many of the third-downa
troubles can be attributed to
breakdowns in the secondary, a
position group that has been in
flux all season. And that trend
definitely continued Saturday.
Saturday marked the fourth
time in six games that the Wol-
verines boasted a new-look line-

found its groove Saturday. In his play (8-of-18 against Iowa) has the game with a huge fumble on

a punt return. Campbell, now
Iowa's wide receivers coach, was
given the Hawkeyes' game ball.
"He's our rookie coach right
now on the staff, only been here
two years, but I'll tell you what -
we don't have anybodythat's more
of a Hawkeye than him," Iowa
coach Kirk Ferentz said,
Campbell was deserving of
the recognition as the Hawkeye
receivers finished with 284 yards
on 20 catches, highlighted by two
touchdown receptions from tight
end Tony Moeaki.
During his time at Michigan,
Campbell coached some of great-
est receivers in Michigan history
and some of the NFL's top play-
ers, including Charles Woodson,
Jason Avant, Braylon Edwards,
Steve Breaston and Mario Man-
ningham.
"'m thankful to Lloyd (Carr)
that he retired - otherwise we
wouldn't have Eric here right
now," Ferentz said.
PUNTING FAR AHEAD:
Fifth-year senior punter Zoltan
Mesko's 53.8 average yards per
punt Saturday earned him Big
Ten special teams Player of the
Week honors.
Mesko became Michigan's
all-time leader in total punt-
ing yards after Western Michi-
gan. After Saturday's game, he's
just 240 yards short of reaching
10,000 yards. Mesko is currently
the NCAA active leader in career
punting.
Mesko's 61-yard punt was a
relief for Michigan after the Wol-
verines went three-and-out from
their own one-yard line early in
the fourth quarter. But Mesko's
bomb easily beat Michigan's cov-
erage, and Iowa's Colin Sandeman
returned the ball 20 yards to the
Michigan 42-yard line.
The Hawkeyes took all the
momentum after the return,
when Iowa quarterback Ricky
Stanzi connected with Moeaki on
a 42-yard touchdown pass to give
the Hawkeyes a 30-21 lead.
"Zoltan kicked the heck dut of
the ball - I thought it was justtre-
mendous," Rodriguez said. "But
he kicked it so well, I think some
of the things in our coverages
weren't as good as I'd like because
they returned some of those.
"We spend a lot of time on it,
but I've really got to see what
we're doing and making sure
we're doing a better job of special
teams."
had a shot at beating Iowa."
But that shot at a win was jeop-
ardized by excessive turnovers.
Though fumbles and interceptions
were two of last year's fatal flaws,
they hadn't been a major issue this
season - until Saturday. Exclud-
ing Robinson's game-sealing inter-
ception with 46 seconds left in the
game, the other four turnovers
accounted for six of the Hawkeyes'
30 points.
But the damage could have poten-
tially been worse. Three of the Wol-
verines' turnovers gave Iowa (2-0
Big Ten, 6-0 overall) the bal in
Michigan territory, but Iowa kicker
Daniel Murray missed a field goal
on one possession and the Hawkeyes
couldn't convert on a fourth-and-
goal from the Michigan 1-yard line
on another.
Those missed opportunities
helped keep Michigan (1-2, 4-2) in
the game. But in the end, the extra
chances only fueled the Wolverines'
second straight heartbreak.
"I would like to say many of our
games won't go down to the wire,
but I have a feeling a whole bunch
of them will," Rodriguez said after
Michigan's 36-33 comeback win
against Indiana. "At least I hope they
do."
Even after losing two last-minute
road games by a combined eight

points, it's clear Rodriguez has got-
ten what he hoped for.

because he was "banged up." But
after the game, Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez said the Detroit
native was suspended for a viola-
tion of team rules.
"When he comes back, it's
eally up to him," Rodriguez
aid. "He's got certain things

academically and all that, and if
"(Cissoko has)
certain things
he's got to do, on
and off the field."
he does that, he'll be back sooner
rather than later."
Cissoko hasn't seen the field
since the early goings of Michi-
gan's win over Indiana. He was
pulled in the first quarter after he
gave up a 57-yard bomb. Redshirt
freshman J.T. Floyd subbed in
and then recorded his first career
start against Michigan State.
"He's been solid in camp and
n practice, and we've been kind
of waiting for him to produce in a
game, and he's made some great
strides," defensive tackle Ryan
Van Bergen said of Floyd after

the Indiana game. "And it's great
to have a third corner going ...
through the Big Ten schedule."
Floyd played well enough
against the Spartans, but he was
clearly the least aggressive of the
three corners, giving a ten-yard
cushion in some instances and
not charging receivers on passes
to the flats.
But Woolfolk's switch to
corner, his position before this
season, put Floyd back on the
bench and raises more questions
about the most maligned unit on
the team. The Wolverines are
dead last in the Big Ten in pass
defense, giving up almost 250
yards a game through the air,
and the constant lineup shifts
are proof that the coaching staff
is still searching for an answer.
After all was said and done,
the secondary gave up 284 yards
Saturday, 50 more than the
Hawkeyes' season average.
Going forward, Michigan
seems to be taking the secondary
situationonaweek-to-weekbasis.
Woolfolk said he had no idea
whether he'll play corner next
week against Delaware State.
"I just play whatever they
want me to play," he said. "I have
a good aspect to bring to the
team because Ican (be) versatile,.
so I'll go to corner, safety, even
quarterback if you need me to.,"

HAWKEYES
From page 1B
was the last player to leave the Kinn-
ick Stadiumvisitors' locker room, his
head down, averting eyes and obey-
ing orders from his coach not to talk
to the media.
The coach himself was short and
sarcastic during his postgame press
conference when asked about the
quarterback situation, and therest of
his players either pleaded ignorance
or didn't want to talk about it.
"I've got two outstanding quar-
terbacks, three quarterbacks, and
we did it," Rodriguez said. "That's
not the story of the game. All right,
next."
Quarterback questions aside, even
with the cadence of the first 58 min-
utes similar to that against Michi-
gan State, Saturday's two-point loss
to Iowa was more poignant. Led by
senior Brandon Minor and a running
game that returned to form Satur-
day (195 yards, 10 first downs and 3
touchdowns) after hibernating in
East Lansing (28 yards, 4 first downs
and 0 touchdowns), the Wolverines
seemed to be in control against Iowa
more often than they were against
the Spartans.
"We didn't deserve to beat Michi-
gan State," senior offensive lineman
David Moosman said. "I think we

Last-ditch shot falls
short in Wolverines'
shutout loss to
Indiana
By JAKE FELDMAN
DailySports Writer
As Saturday's Michigan men's
soccer game wound down, the
Wolverines trailed Indiana 1-0.
With three seconds remaining,
freshman forward Alex Marti-
nez slipped through traffic in the
oppos-
ing box MICHIGAN 0
and sent INDIANA 1
the ball
toward the net. Indiana goal-
keeper Luis Soffner extended his
long arms and deflected the ball
away, thwarting Michigan's final
attack.
The fans at the U-M Soccer
Complex fell silent as they real-
ized the disheartening outcome.
And as the final whistle sound-
ed, several Wolverines crumbled
to the ground in agony.
"There's two different types of
pain that players feel after losses
- the pain of discipline and the

pain of regret," Michigan coach
Steve Burns said. "The pain of
regret is when you cut corners
and you take chances and it
doesn't pay off for you. The pain
of discipline is playing with a lot
of effort, playing hard, and unfor-
tunately not getting the result.
And I thought it was really the
pain of discipline."
The loss was deflating for a
Michigan team that dominated
the possession battle and out-
played the 14th-ranked Hoo-
siers. Indiana owns a 13-1-1
record against the Wolverines
and knocked Michigan out of the
NCAA Tournament last year.
In past seasons, the Hoosiers
(2-0 Big Ten, 6-4-1 overall) have
fielded more talented squads than
their counterparts in Ann Arbor.
On Saturday, the Wolverines (1-2,
8-3-1) allowed that history to dic-
tate the outcome of the game.
"For the first half, we were
clearly the dominant team,"
Burns said. "But it took us the
entire half to come to grips with
that. Had we been playing an
opponent that didn't have seven
stars on their jersey, I think that
we would have absolutely won
the game in the first half."
Despite numerous Michigan
scoring opportunities, the game

remained scoreless until the 54th
minute. Indiana forward Andy
Adlard intercepted a Michigan
pass in the middle of the field and
sent the ball into the top right cor-
ner, netting the game's lone goal.
The Hoosiers didn't threaten to
score again and relied on stellar
play from Soffner to preserve the
win.'
Senior forward Mauro Fuzetti
was. a nonfactor, facing double
teams for much of the game.
The Wolverines are 1-3-1 when
Fuzetti doesn't score, as the star
forward's goals often provide his
teammates with the momentum
and confidence to score.
The loss all but removes the
Wolverines from contention
for the Big Ten Championship,
since they now trail four teams
in the conference standings.
Nevertheless, players remain
confident that they will thrive
in the postseason and vindicate
Saturday's defeat - if given the
chance.
"We would love to play Indiana
again," senior captain Julian Rob-
les said. "They pretty much stole
one away from us. If we played
them again, our intensity would
be even higher than it was. I think
everyone on our team would just
love that opportunity"

Here's one Mesko for, well, Mesko's punting.
But he was the only special teams player
who showed up. Mathews fumbled a critical
punt and Stonum struggled with kickoff
returns. It was a pretty rough night.

After the first few questions, it looked
like Rodriguez was going to pull a Drew

his "next question" responses. Rodriguez
was pretty ticked, to say the least.

Big Houses beating an eight-point underdog, but Iowa also
