Last week, the University 
of Michigan administration 
responded 
to 
Richard 
Spencer’s request to speak on 
campus, and moved forward to 
negotiate the event. Today, in 
protest of the administration 
refusing to deny the request, 
hundreds of students walked 
out of their classes and rallied 
in the Diag, then marched into 
other classrooms on campus.
A few hundred students 
and 
community 
members 
gathered in the University of 
Michigan Diag at about noon 
on Wednesday, and after a 
short rally, marched to the 
Chemistry Building, Mason 
Hall and the Fish Bowl in 
Angell Hall. The rally is part 
of the #StopSpencer week of 
action, which includes teach-
ins and other forms of protest.
“On Wednesday, November 
29 2017, Stop Spencer at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
is 
organizing a student walk 
out at 11:45 AM in response 
to the failure of University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel 
and 
the 
Regents 
to deny white supremacist 
Richard 
Spencer’s 
request 
to speak on campus,” the 
Facebook 
event 
reads. 
“We 
cannot 
learn 
in 
an 
environment that is constantly 
disrupting our learning by 
threatening our safety and 
dehumanizing us.”
On Nov. 21, the University 
said it was going to proceed 
with 
Spencer’s 
request 
to 
speak on campus, given the 
administration 
can 
ensure 
the safety of students. In an 
emergency meeting of the 
University’s Board of Regents, 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
laid 
out 
“three 
components” to the decision: 
the 
safety 
of 
students, 
protecting free speech in a 

democratic society, and that 
denying the request would 
give more attention to Spencer 
and 
his 
cause. 
Schlissel 
repeatedly said safety must 
be guaranteed in order for the 
event to take place. 
LSA senior and organizer 
Hoai An Pham said, however, 
in a speech to the protesters 
in the Diag, the walk-out 
wasn’t just in protest to the 
University’s 
response 
last 
week.
“This week is not just 
about 
protesting 
Spencer 
coming 
here, 
it’s 
about 
protesting white supremacy 
and it’s about protesting the 
administration’s 
lackluster 
response, inactive, bystander 
response to a literal white 
supremacist coming on this 
campus,” Pham said. “The 
thing is here too, on this 
campus every single day, on 
a regular basis we have hate 
crimes that are coming.”
Spencer’s 
representative 
first requested he speak on 
the University’s campus at the 
end of October. This request 
came 
after 
Spencer 
had 
requested to speak at several 
other universities, including 
Michigan 
State 
University 
and University of Florida. The 
University of Florida initially 
denied a request from Spencer, 
but after being threatened 
with a lawsuit, relented and 
allowed Spencer to speak in 
October.
On Aug. 17, a statement 
released from the Office of 
the President at Michigan 
State 
University 
declared 
MSU would deny the National 
Policy Institute’s request to 
rent space on campus. The NPI 
is a white nationalist think 
tank led by Spencer. MSU now 
faces a lawsuit for not allowing 
Spencer to speak.
The 
lawyer 
representing 
Spencer threatened to sue the 
University earlier in November 
if it did not accommodate 

Spencer’s 
request, 
giving 
the administration a week 
deadline to make a decision. 
This deadline has since been 
extended until Dec. 8.
Previously, 
University 
Regent Ron Weiser (R) said 
in an email Spencer was “a 
dangerous 
and 
disgusting 
man.”
University Regent Denise 
Illitch (D), however, was 
the only regent opposing 
the 
decision 
last 
week, 
stating while free speech is a 
concern of hers, the violence 
that accompanies Spencer 
must be considered.
“Unfortunately, I do not 
agree with the University of 
Michigan 
administration,” 
she said. “While I am a 
staunch proponent of the 
First Amendment, and stand 
firmly in support of our 
constitution, I remain very 
concerned that it is unsafe 
to allow him to speak at the 
University 
of 
Michigan. 
Violence 
follows 
him 
wherever he goes.”
LSA senior Kim Truong, 
said free speech should not 
justify the administration 
potentially allowing space on 
campus for Spencer to speak.
During 
the 
protest, 
a 
situation occurred in the 
Fishbowl where LSA junior 
Princess 
Felix 
challenged 
protesters, arguing it would 
not be fair to bar Spencer 
from speaking. If students 
didn’t like what he was 
saying, 
Felix 
said, 
they 
shouldn’t listen.
“If you’re not going to 
listen to people, then you 
don’t have a right to be heard. 
You listen to others, and you 
will be heard,” she said. “If 
he wants to kill people, then 
he will get arrested when he 
kills someone.”

LSA sophomore Lexi Michaels 
wasn’t expecting to be late to her 
Psychology 280 exam. In fact, 
she thought she was early. But 
when she walked into the testing 
accommodations room a few 
minutes after 2:30 — she’d run 
there right from her last class — 
she realized the exam was not 
being administered on Michigan 
Time, and everyone else had 
already started.
“My expectation was that 
it would (start on Michigan 
Time), 
because 
that’s 
what 
most of my classes and exams 
start on, even if they’re in a 
testing accommodations room,” 
Michaels said. “And it didn’t. I 
walked in really flustered. I was 
like, ‘Are they going to let me take 
the exam?’”
After 
the 
initial 
scare, 
everything turned out fine for 
Michaels. She was still given a 
full two hours to take her exam, 
and no one was angry at her for 
coming in late. However, start 
time confusion is common at the 
University of Michigan, and the 
administration has decided it’s 
time to take action.
Starting May 1, no University 
classes will run on Michigan 
Time, the 10 minute late-start 
built into most undergraduate 
classes 
at 
the 
University. 
Michigan time is a University 
tradition that dates back to the 
1930s. Students and professors 
used 
to 
time 
their 
classes 
according to the chimes of the 
Burton Tower at the beginning 
of each hour, and Michigan time 
was officially adopted to allow 
students to get from class to class 
without being late. Now, to allow 
for students to get to back-to-
back classes, all classes will stop 
10 minutes before the hour.
Though administrators have 
been talking about removing 
Michigan Time for many years 
now — University Provost Martin 
Philbert said there have been 
conversations since he came to 

the University in 1995 — this is 
the first time anything conclusive 
has passed. The change will start 
in May for the Spring and Summer 
terms, so any unexpected kinks 
can be worked out before the Fall 
2018 semester.
“The freshmen will come in 
not knowing a time we had it,” 
Philbert said.
 According to Philbert, it was a 
“tradition born out of necessity.”
Now, 
however, 
some 
see 
the 
once-crucial 
tradition 
as a hindrance. Many newer 
University schools never adopted 
it, and Patricia Hurn, dean of the 
School of Nursing, told The Daily 
in an email Michigan time was 
never an option for the Nursing 
School.

School of Nursing, told The Daily 
in an email Michigan time was 
never an option for the Nursing 
School.
“The major reason our classes 
have not used Michigan Time 
is because we are a clinical 
discipline,” Hurn wrote.
“So we very early on aligned 
our class times, specifically the 
on-the-hour start time, with the 
time of our clinical partners. 
None of these partners recognize 
or utilize ‘Michigan time.’”

Problems 
arise 
when 
University units aren’t operating 
on synchronized schedules, and 
because programs like Nursing don’t 
have the option of Michigan time, 
Philbert thinks going to “clock time” 
is the most logical course of action.
One of the major issues the new 
system aims to fix is the shortage 
of classrooms. When some schools 
are on Michigan time and others 
are not, classrooms are unavailable 
for up to 10 minutes at the end of the 
hour.
“We have the need for more 
classrooms,” Philbert said. “We have 
more sections, which require more 
rooms, and some of these rooms 
require specialized services. So by 
aligning time, we free up the number 
and types of classrooms available.”
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University is 
also hoping the switch will make 
collaboration 
among 
different 
schools and departments easier.
“I’d say one of the hallmarks 
of our campus is cross-University 
collaboration,” 
Fitzgerald 
said. 
“From school and colleges and 
departments 
and 
different 
units who are constantly cross-
pollinating all of our efforts, and this 
really facilitates that… We’re just 
eliminating one of those stumbling 
blocks.”
Though there are clear benefits 
for faculty and administrators, 
students are uncertain about the 
upcoming change. Michaels, even 
after her exam confusion, thinks 
Michigan time works well. She’s 
concerned professors will have a 
difficult time stopping 10 minutes 
short of the hour.
“I really like Michigan time. 
I think it makes so much sense, 
especially when you have back-to-
back classes,” she said. “It gets your 
day rolling. I think that (this new 
system) is just a cause for disaster. I 
think that professors are way more 
aware of starting 10 minutes late 
because they haven’t started yet, but 
if they have to end 10 minutes early, 
they’re not going to know to stop.”
While Michaels understands 
this could eventually be a good 
system, the thought of working

Former students allege 40 years of 
misconduct by SMTD professor 

SAMMY SUSSMAN
2020 Daily News Editor

The University of Michigan hired 
Stephen Shipps as an associate professor 
of music on Sept. 1, 1989. Since then, he has 
had a successful academic career at the 
University. From 2001 to 2004, he served 
on the Executive Committee of the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance. From 2002 to 
2007, he served as the associate dean for 
academic affairs. He is currently the chair of 
strings and the faculty director of the Strings 
Preparatory Academy, a university-affiliated 
pre-college music program for local middle 
and high school students.
A Michigan Daily investigation unearthed 
previously undisclosed allegations of sexual 
harassment and sexual misconduct against 
Shipps. These reports span nearly 40 years, 
from Fall 1978 to a University-affiliated 
summer program in the last five years. 
They include accusations of unwanted 
touching, sexual assault, prolonged sexual 
relationships with teenage students, and 
misogynistic and sexist verbal statements.
Shipps declined to comment for this 
article. His lawyer, David Nacht, also 
declined to comment.
The Daily also found reports that at least 
one faculty member in the Music, Theatre 
& Dance school, Prof. Yizhak Schotten, was 
made aware of some of these allegations 
soon after Shipps’s hiring was announced 
and before he started teaching. It is unclear 
whether he communicated these concerns to 
the University at the time, or if the University 
has ever been made aware of these concerns.

***
Shipps taught at the University of North 
Carolina School of the Arts — known then as 
the North Carolina School of the Arts before 
a 2008 name change — prior to coming 
to the University of Michigan. The Daily 
spoke with a former North Carolina School 
of the Arts college student, who wished to 
remain anonymous, citing professional and 
privacy concerns. She currently serves as 
the associate principal second (the second-
ranked member of the second violin section) 
in a full-time professional orchestra. In this 
article, she will be referred to as Meghan.
Meghan was an international student 
assigned to Shipps’s private studio in NCSA. 
By the end of her freshman year, she felt 
uncomfortable in Shipps’s studio.
“There had been small things that I was 
uncomfortable with,” she said. “I had heard 
rumors of flirting. I had seen flirting. … He 
had overemphasized my talent in master 
classes a number of times, held me up to 
other students. I was a freshman, so it was 
awkward.”
Near the end of the year, Meghan told 
Shipps she wanted to switch studios. Elaine 
Richey was the other violin teacher at the 
UNCSA at the time. Meghan was given the 
impression that she would have no trouble 
switching studios. She began making plans 
for the summer assuming she would be 
studying with Richey in the fall.
In one of her last private lessons, Shipps 
requested Meghan come see him after hours 
for her final private lesson. She had never 
had a late-night lesson before, but she agreed 
nevertheless.

According 
to 
her 
account, as she walked into Shipps’s studio 
that evening, the lights were dimmed. After 
she put down her violin, she says Shipps 
moved behind her and locked the door to his 
office.
“I thought that was very strange, but at 
that moment I didn’t feel threatened by it,” 
she said. “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, that’s 

weird,’ but I probably just cast it aside as being 
secure after hours. I wasn’t really thinking 
about it, but I remember I noticed it and it 
probably made me a bit uncomfortable.”
She pulled out her violin and started to 
play. But after a little while, she remembers 
Shipps stopped her. He told her she wasn’t 
playing with enough passion — that she 

needed to improve her understanding of 
passion in order to improve her playing.
“He kept on talking, talking about this 
and moving closer to me and I was backing 
away just very subtly,” she said.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


In the middle of the Michigan 

League’s 
Maizie’s 
Kitchen 
& 

Market, a dozen undergraduate 
students huddled around a laptop 
to sign in for their canvassing 
shifts. The small group decided 
to brave the January blizzard and 
knock doors for Solomon Rajput, a 
27-year-old Ann Arbor native who 
put his medical studies on hold for 
a year to challenge Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Mich., for Michigan’s 
12th congressional seat.

Dingell has represented the 

district for the last four years. 
Previously, it was held by the late 
John Dingell for 59 years and, 
before that, by his father John 
Dingell Sr. for 22 years. Rajput 
hopes to disrupt this 85-year-old 
political dynasty. 

He said he was interested in 

politics as a teenager but was 
disenchanted with how candidates 
seemed to be controlled by big 
corporations. Still looking to make 
a difference, Rajput decided to 
enter the medical field. 

“I ended up in medicine because 

it is a way to help people in a very 
vulnerable moment, heal people,” 
Rajput said. “I was thinking maybe 
we can change our healthcare 
system from the inside out.”

After Hillary Clinton lost the 

2016 presidential election, Rajput’s 
political ambitions were reignited, 
leading him to found the activist 
organization Michigan Resistance. 
The goal of the group was to 
advocate for local progressive bills 
in the county and state legislature. 
Noting the success of progressive 
campaigns such as those run by 
U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez, D-New York, and Rashida 
Tlaib, D-Mich., in 2018, Rajput 
said he became hopeful that 
he, too, would be able to make a 

difference through politics.

In September 2019, he decided 

to put his medical studies on the 
back burner and run for Dingell’s 
seat. 

“I feel like times are changing, 

and it’s actually really exciting 
because we have a new generation 
of leaders who are running for 
office. We’re saying we’re not 
going to be beholden to corporate 
interest any longer,” Rajput said. 
“It’s so cool to see people like 
Bernie Sanders and AOC and 
Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, 
and what kind of leaders they can 
be when they’re just unapologetic 
champions for what the people 
need. And they don’t need to get 
their permission slip signed from 
their corporate donors before they 
can make any statement.” 

In the corner of the cafe 

checking in volunteers was LSA 
freshman Gina Liu, the campaign’s 
campus 
coordinator 
for 
the 

University of Michigan. As more 
students filed into the cafe, Rajput 
began greeting them personally. 
He aims to not only campaign on 
a strong ideological platform but 
to rely on passionate grassroots 
volunteers while doing so.

“His experience is grassroots 

and his experience aligns with 
a lot of the constituents in this 
district and the young people in 
this district,” Liu said. “Seeing 
someone who actually is willing 
to fight the issues and also just 
not accept corporate money, that’s 
inspiring to me.”

Rajput’s platform is built on 

key 
policy 
pillars, 
including 

aggressively 
fighting 
climate 

change and rejecting corporate 
PAC money. He believes Congress 
needs to pass a Green New Deal. 

Since District 12 has six colleges 

and a large student population, 
Rajput also believes it’s necessary 
to make college free and eliminate 
student debt. He argues that 
Medicare for All and single-payer 

healthcare should not only be 
supported as an opportunistic 
political move, but as a steadfast 
Democratic ideal. 

“Part of the reason why I 

decided to run was because I was 
taking a look at how progressive 
our district actually is,” Rajput 
said. “Unfortunately, (Dingell’s) 
not the progressive champion that 
we need on these issues.”

As 
Rajput 
recounted 
his 

experiences 
canvassing, 
he 

claimed voters are not necessarily 
excited about having Dingell as 
their representative, but feel like 
she will always hold the seat. In 
these instances, Rajput makes his 
case a viable alternative. 

“There’s this perception that 

Rep. Dingell is beloved in the 
community or that she is very 
active,” Rajput said. “(But) when 
we go and talk to voters, it’s 
remarkable 
how 
infrequently 

Congresswoman Dingell’s name is 
brought up.”

However, because he is new 

to the political sphere, Rajput’s 
understanding of some of the 
issues important to voters in the 
district is less developed. One of 
the predominant issues in District 
12 is the man-made water crisis, 
where toxic PFAS chemicals have 
seeped into Michigan’s waters. 
These 
chemicals 
are 
linked 

to numerous health concerns, 
including 
cancer. 
Dingell 

co-authored the bipartisan PFAS 
Action Act, which passed the 
House of Representatives on Jan. 
10. 

While Rajput noted the work 

that Dingell has done to combat 
PFAS, he said he believes she and 
the Democrats are only making 
incremental legislation and not 
considering the larger issue at 
hand — climate change. 

As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 

took a moment to look out onto 
the sea of attendees at his rally on 
the University of Michigan Diag, 
he addressed the crowd: “So 
right now, in this moment, we 
have got to look around us and 
what we have got to determine is 
whether you’re satisfied with the 
status quo.” 

On Sunday evening, more than 

10,000 students, faculty and Ann 
Arbor residents took to the Diag, 
wearing Sanders’s campaign gear 
waving white and blue “Bernie” 
campaign signs. Students began 
lining up as many as five hours 
before the rally was scheduled to 
begin at 6 p.m.

LSA senior Martha Abrams 

got in line at 1 p.m. and said she 
is voting for Sanders primarily 
because 
of 
his 
consistently 

held positions. She also said 
his positions on crime and the 
environment are reasons for her 
support. 

“He has a consistent record 

in regards to criminal justice 
reform and being against mass 
incarceration, 
whereas 
Biden 

definitely doesn’t,” Abrams said. 
“(Biden) has passed legislation 
(...) that really helped establish 
the carceral state as it exists 
today. With the environment, 
Bernie seems to be one of the 
frontrunners in acknowledging 

how pressing that issue is.” 

The rally featured a spate of 

Michigan and national political 
figures 
including 
U.S. 
Rep. 

Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 

D-N.Y., 
former 
gubernatorial 

candidate Abdul El-Sayed and 
state Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 
Arbor.

El-Sayed rallied the crowd 

when he spoke before Ocasio-
Cortez 
and 
Sanders 
took 

the stage. Sanders endorsed 
El-Sayed during his campaign 
for Michigan governor, who said 
his previous conversation with 
Sanders increased his confidence 
in grassroots movements.

“When I ran, I was lucky 

enough 
to 
get 
Bernie’s 

endorsement. Let me tell you 
about the conversation we had,” 
El-Sayed said. “He didn’t ask me 
what I stood for. He said I know 
what you fight for, but I want to 
know why you fight for it. And I 
told him about my grandmother, 
who never got the opportunity to 
go to school, though she was the 
smartest, wisest woman I have 
ever met. She used to remind 
me about when I go visit that it 
wasn’t about me. It was about the 
opportunities that I had.”

Ocasio-Cortez 
introduced 

Sanders, 
thanking 
Reverend 

Jesse Jackson for his March 7 
endorsement of the senator. She 
discussed Sanders’ long-standing 
support for marginalized groups, 
citing it as a reason for her 
support. She also noted how, as 
mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 

1980s, Sanders endorsed Jackson 
for president at the Burlington 
Democratic presidential caucus.

“When it was time for the 

Vermont 
caucuses 
to 
come 

around, Mayor Sanders stood up 
to break the common consensus 
and endorsed Reverend Jesse 
Jackson for president,” Ocasio-
Cortez said. “He stood up and 
delivered that speech in the 
Vermont caucuses. He was yelled 
at, he was hit, but he said this is 
our opportunity to bring millions 
of working people into our 
political process and transform 
who America can work for.” 

Following 
Ocasio-Cortez’s 

introduction, Sanders walked on 
stage as John Lennon’s “Power 
to the People” played in the 
background. Upon entering the 
stage, he thanked Jackson and 
Ocasio-Cortez for their support 
and public service.

“What history is about is to 

understand that there have been 
extraordinarily 
brave 
people 

throughout 
history,” 
Sanders 

said. “People who’ve put their 
lives on the line, sometimes who 
have died, gone to jail in the 
struggle for justice. And that 
is what this campaign is about. 
That is what Jesse Jackson’s 
life has been about, that is what 
Alexandria’s life is about. And 
that’s what I hope all of your lives 
will be about.”

“You were born on purpose,” 

Yusef Salaam, public speaker 
and one of the Exonerated 
Five, said. “If you were born on 
purpose, then you were born 
with a purpose.” 

Salaam spoke to a crowd of 

more than 400 people at the 
Michigan Union Ballroom on 
February 3. Sponsors of the 
event 
included 
Multi-Ethnic 

Student 
Affairs, 
the 
Ford 

School of Public Policy and the 
Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies, among 
many others. 

The 
Exonerated 
Five, 

previously known as the Central 
Park Five, were falsely accused 
of rape in 1989 and sentenced 
for up to 13 years in prison as 
teenagers in New York. The 
defendants’ assault convictions 
were overturned in 2002 and 
the five agreed to a $40 million 
settlement in 2014. A Netflix 
series called “When They See 
Us” shares the true story of the 
Exonerated Five. Salaam was 
only 15 years old when he went to 
prison and was exonerated when 
the actual assailant confessed to 
the Central Park rape. 

DAAS 
Program 
Associate 

Elizabeth James began the event 
with an acknowledgment of the 
Union occupying formerly tribal 
land. MESA staff Leslie Tetteh 
and Saveri Nandigama then gave 
the welcoming address. Three 
poets performed before Salaam 
was introduced to the audience 
with a standing ovation. 

Salaam engaged with the 

audience as he walked across the 
stage multiple times to address 
the large crowd. He shared 
stories about the effects prison 
had on his life and how he grew 
through his incarceration. 

Salaam said an important part 

of his identity is his religion and 
he spoke about how Islam helped 
him grow into a leader during 
and after his time in prison. The 
presence of his religion made 
others aware of his character.

“Six months in jail, this 

officer asked me a question that 
seemed basic,” Salaam said. “He 
said ‘Hey there, who are you? 
I’ve been watching you. You are 
not supposed to be here. Who are 
you?’”

LSA 
freshman 
Temilolu 

Yusuf told The Daily she enjoyed 
hearing Salaam talk about the 
role of religion in his journey 
through prison. 

“I love the fact that he 

really 
incorporated 
religion 

and the role of religion in his 
incarceration process, as well as 
his exoneration,” Yusuf said. “He 
really shows that for some things 
in life, that you really need that 
belief and support system… Even 
in prison, where many people 
use religion as a way to bring 
themselves up and not feel like 
prisoners, feel like they have 
control over themselves. It was 
amazing to see that he’s telling 
us, as people who have never 
been in prison, that religion is 
something that you shouldn’t 
only have when your back is 
against the wall. You should 
have it all the time.”

During his speech, Salaam 

also discussed how, in the 1980s, 
President 
Donald 
Trump, 
a 

prominent business figure in 
New York at the time, wanted the 
five teenagers to be sentenced 
to the death penalty only two 
weeks after their arrest. Salaam 
discussed the horrific statements 
Trump made about them and his 
reaction when Trump became 
president. Salaam spoke about 
Trump while holding up a copy 
of an advertisement Trump paid

The University of Michigan 

announced on Wednesday all 
classes on all three campuses will 
be held online beginning March 16 
through the end of the semester, 
April 21, in response to the COVID-
19 virus. Classes on Thursday and 
Friday will be canceled. However, 
the University will remain open, 
including dorms and dining halls.

In a statement shared on 

Twitter, 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel wrote the changes 
are meant to maximize the safety 
of the campus communities.

“To protect the health and 

safety of our communities and 
minimize the spread of #COVID19, 
@UMich is making changes to 
classes, travel, study abroad and 
large events on our Ann Arbor, @
UM_Dearborn 
and 
@UMFlint 

campuses,” Schlissel wrote.

Events expected to attract 

more than 100 people will also 
be canceled, including Honors 
Convocation. According to the 
statement, updates about plans 
for 
commencement 
will 
be 

provided when more information 
is available.

On-campus sporting events will 

be limited to parents and members 
of the press.

All spring and summer study 

abroad programs through the 
University will be canceled, given 
the severity of the outbreak. All 
other 
University 
international 

travel will also be suspended, 
except under rare circumstances 
requiring approval.

The World Health Organization 

declared the COVID-19 outbreak 
a global pandemic Wednesday 
afternoon as the virus continues to 
spread globally.

The move to online classes 

comes a day after Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer signed an executive order 
declaring a state of emergency 
following the diagnosis of the first 
two cases of the COVID-19 virus in 
Michigan.

In a press conference Tuesday 

evening, 
Whitmer 
said 
she 

declared the state of emergency 
to maximize efforts and to assist 
local governments and officials in 
slowing the spread of COVID-19.

“We’re taking every step that 

we can to mitigate the virus 
spread and keep Michiganders 
safe,” Whitmer said in the press 
conference.

The two diagnosed cases in 

Michigan include a middle-aged 
Oakland County woman who has 
recently traveled internationally 
and a middle-aged Wayne County 
man who has recently traveled 
domestically.

Michigan Medicine announced 

Wednesday morning the hospital is 
treating one of the two confirmed 
Michigan coronavirus cases. 

According to the University’s 

webpage on COVID-19, individuals 
should wash their hands often 
with soap for 20 seconds, avoid 
close contact with those who are 
sick and stay home when sick to 
prevent the spread of the virus.

Prior 
to 
the 
University’s 

decision to move classes online, 
universities across the state had 
already 
suspended 
in-person 

classes. Michigan State University 

suspended all face-to-face classes 
beginning at noon today, March 
11. MSU President Samuel Stanley 
announced in an email to MSU 
students this morning. Online 
class instruction will last until 
April 20.

Central Michigan University 

also asked students not to return 
to campus after spring break and 
announced they will be moving 
their classes online through March 
20. CMU will make a decision on 
whether to continue online classes 
on March 19.

Wayne 
State 
University 

announced Wednesday afternoon 
it will be extending spring break 
until March 23 to help plan for the 
transition to online classes.

Other 
universities 
across 

the United States have called 
off in-person classes this week, 
including Harvard University and 
Ohio State University.

As classes have been canceled 

across the country, some on social 
media have noted the sudden 
requests for students to leave 
campus may be harder to adjust 
to for students who may rely on 
university housing or meal plans. 
Additionally, 
they 
said 
some 

students may depend on work-
study as a source of income. 

Others have noted students 

may not be able to go home 
because of transportation costs 
or travel restrictions, or because 
coronavirus 
may 
be 
more 

widespread in that location.

OPINION
over the
YEARS

As much as I would love to 

find a different topic to write 

about, the COVID-19 pandemic 

has 
been 
the 
only 
relevant 

topic that has been updating 

itself for the past few weeks. 

The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

encouraged all students to return 

to their permanent residence, 

so I left Ann Arbor to fly back 

to South Korea last Saturday. 

When I finally stepped out of the 

airplane full of people sharing 

the same objective of reaching 

their homes after about 14 hours 

of travel, I could see that my 

home country was dealing with 

the whole pandemic situation in 

a radically different manner.

It usually takes about 10 to 

15 minutes to get through the 

passport control and pick up 

your luggage at the Incheon 

International Airport. However, 

this time it took me an hour 

and a half. Several teams of 

airport staff members and public 

health workers lined up the 

passengers where they checked 

if all incoming passengers had 

downloaded 
a 
self-diagnosis 

tracking application on their 

phones. 
I 
was 
given 
more 

than enough information and 

explanation 
regarding 
the 

application and the need for us 

to download it to keep track of 

our health. Then, when I finally 

reached the actual checkpoint, 

a public health official checked 

my temperature with a simple 

electronic 
thermometer. 
I 

recorded 
98.6 
degrees 
and 

was given a piece of paper that 

read “quarantine certificate.” I 

was then asked to fill out brief 

paperwork that asked for my 

address and phone number. When 

I asked the officer collecting the 

paperwork what this was for, he 

kindly answered that the Korean 

government newly mandated all 

its returning citizens to practice 

self-quarantine for 14 days and 

those pieces of information were 

needed for the local government 

of my residence to check on my 

status. Out of curiosity, I then 

asked if there would be legal 

repercussions if I broke the self-

quarantine and the answer was, 

as expected, yes. Noncompliance 

to 
the 
self-quarantine 
order 

is punishable by up to a year 

of imprisonment or a fine up 

to 10,000,000 won, which is 

equivalent to almost $10,000. 

South Korea had two unique 

strategies dealing with COVID-

19 that the United States did 

not. 
The 
first 
was 
testing. 

Korea was much quicker to 

react to the global health crisis 

when compared to many other 

countries, partly because of its 

past experience with Middle 

Eastern Respiratory Syndrome 

(MERS) in 2015. As soon as the 

first confirmed COVID-19 case 

from 
China 
was 
announced, 

Korean companies jumped in on 

developing test kits. Beginning 

in late February, soon after 

the Lunar New Year holidays, 

Korea started to develop the 

capability 
of 
testing 
about 

20,000 people a day and now 

has about 10,000 tests run per 

one million people, which is the 

highest confirmed data among all 

affected countries. 

The 
second 
strategy 
was 

heightened, 
yet 
relatively 

well-accepted, surveillance on 

citizens. This does not mean that 

the Korean government wiretaps 

phone calls or collects all private 

information 
to 
track 
certain 

individuals down. Rather, the 

government effectively utilized 

the recent trend of cashless 

transactions and spiked use of 

smartphones to track people 

who 
came 
in 
contact 
with 

a 
confirmed 
patient. 
Korea 

has 
the 
highest 
proportion 

of 
cashless 
transactions 
and 

one 
of 
the 
highest 
phone 

ownership rates in the world. 

In 
addition, 
the 
government 

was able to successfully trace 

those in mandatory 14-day self-

quarantine; the application I was 

told to download upon arrival 

was not only for self-diagnosis 

reporting but also for location 

tracking to notify the designated 

local government official if I 

leave my self-quarantine spot. 

The designated local government 

official calls me every morning 

to check if I am still in my self-

quarantine spot and asks if I am 

showing any symptoms. Korean 

citizens, including myself, do not 

have much problem with being 

possibly 
traced 
or 
receiving 

phone 
calls 
from 
the 
local 

government 
every 
morning. 

Except 
for 
some 
outrageous 

cases of noncompliance to the 

self-quarantine order, including 

a South Korean student traveling 

to Jeju Island with her mother a 

day after arriving in Korea from 

the U.S., most citizens are taking 

social distancing fairly seriously. 

I am certainly not an expert 

in 
biomedical 
industries 
of 

either country but I doubt the 

U.S. lacks the technology or 

capital to develop testing kits. 

One of the crucial differences 

between Korea and the U.S. 

was the government’s attitude. 

President Trump dismissed the 

potential severity of the virus 

when it first emerged as a global 

health threat while consistently 

labeling it the “Chinese Virus.” 

President 
Trump 
had 
also 

poorly reorganized the National 

Security Council (NSC) so that it 

was not fit to react to pandemics 

like 
COVID-19. 
The 
Obama 

administration had done the same 

but restored the original NSC 

structure after going through the 

Ebola crisis in 2014. In addition, 

the Trump administration was 

recently found to have told 

the federal agency to classify 

COVID-19 deliberations, keeping 

crucial 
information 
like 
the 

scope of infection and quarantine 

restrictions from the public. 

While Korea learned from MERS 

in 2015, it seems as if the U.S. did 

not learn much from Ebola in 

2014. 

I am not saying the U.S. 

should implement such a strict 

enforcement on self-quarantine 

and social distancing without 

much consideration. Americans 

could certainly react differently 

than Koreans if they were legally 

obligated to not leave their 

homes and local government 

agents 
kept 
track 
of 
them 

constantly. However, given the 

recent trend of ever-increasing 

cases, some form of mandatory 

social distancing does not sound 

too egregious. The disease is not 

successfully 
being 
contained, 

especially in Michigan where 

the cases only continue to rise. 

Maybe the society as a whole 

really should consider a hard-

hitting method like that of 

Korea to possibly bring the 

curve down.

What we can learn from Korea

The University of Michigan 

recently announced that it would 

transition to winter rush for social 

Greek 
organizations, 
starting 

in the 2019-2020 academic year 

as part of a plan to improve the 

first-year experience. The new 

plan requires students to have 

completed at least 12 resident 

credit-hours and to be in good 

behavioral and academic standing 

before they can participate in 

the rush process. The change 

will affect about 2,000 students 

annually according to an email 

sent by E. Royster Harper, vice 

president for Student Life on 

March 21st.

The change comes following 

a 
two-month 
self-imposed 

ban on social activities by 

the 
Interfraternity 
Council 

after 
reports 
of 
hazing, 

drug and alcohol abuse, as 

well as allegations of sexual 

misconduct. 
The 
Zeta 
Beta 

Tau 
fraternity’s 
national 

organization also revoked its 

chapter at the University for 

violating multiple policies and 

endangering its members. We 

believe this policy change is 

a step in the right direction 

toward creating a Greek life 

system that exists to improve 

the university experience of 

students, especially freshmen, 

instead of detracting from it.

The 
decision 
by 
the 

University 
will 
be 
most 

beneficial to the new freshmen 

class and allow its members 

more opportunities to become 

better 
acclimated 
to 
their 

campus community. Being a 

new freshman can be daunting, 

and the question of whether 

or not to join social Greek 

life 
in 
the 
first 
semester 

adds to the pressure. When 

freshmen 
arrive 
at 
college, 

their first friends are often 

those who live in the same 

residence halls as them. As the 

semester continues, students 

find 
themselves 
branching 

out and making new friends 

through 
their 
classes 
and 

student 
organizations. 
This 

allows freshmen to try various 

activities and find what they 

like best.

Fraternities and sororities 

often sell the experience to 

freshmen 
by 
promising 
an 

immediate new group of friends 

and a great social life. Greek 

life, however, is an aspect of 

campus life that requires a 

large time commitment and 

could cause new students to 

insulate 
themselves 
within 

their fraternity or sorority. 

With this change, students 

will have more time and energy 

to put towards the equally 

important academic transition 

from high school to college. 

This will also allow freshmen 

more time to find out how they 

want to spend their time on 

campus without first requiring 

them to commit to a time-

consuming rush and pledge 

process.

Additionally, the new winter 

rush process helps new students 

become 
acclimated 
to 
the 

drinking culture on campus. As 

most students are aware, the 

social atmosphere in college is 

usually vastly different from 

high school. The expectations, 

the amount of alcohol and other 

drugs available and the number 

of people with whom students 

can engage in these activities 

drastically 
increases 
during 

Welcome Week. Nowhere is 

this more pronounced than 

in fraternities, who host the 

majority 
of 
Welcome 
Week 

events and provide alcohol for 

thousands of students every 

weekend.

There are obvious dangers 

associated with this newfound 

easy access to alcohol and 

other substances, as evidenced 

by 
more 
than 
30 
hospital 

transports during the weekend 

of the Michigan State game 

and seven during Halloween 

weekend. With winter rush, 

students will still go out and 

experience college life, but will 

be able to make better decisions 

about the drinking culture that 

comes with it, as they would 

have had time to acclimate in 

the fall.

There are, however, some 

concerns about the new policy. 

Suspending 
fall 
rush 
for 

fraternities may also simply 

lead to an informal rushing 

process that may exclude some 

freshmen who do not have 

the right connections. This 

“underground 
rush” 
would 

also be completely unregulated 

by 
the 
University, 
though 

one could possibly argue that 

currently the University has 

very little oversight regardless.

Lastly, 
this 
decision 

also 
could 
unfairly 
affect 

multicultural 
fraternities 

who provide a unique space 

for 
the 
members 
of 
their 

respective communities. When 

minority students arrive at the 

University’s 
predominantly 

white campus, multicultural 

Greek life can offer a support 

system that the transition to 

winter rush could threaten to 

delay.

Overall, however, the change 

to a winter rush process is a 

strong step by the University 

to 
improve 
the 
first-year 

experience 
and 
limit 
the 

insularity of Greek life on 

campus. Freshmen will have 

an 
opportunity 
to 
explore 

their 
interests 
and 
make 

better-informed 
decisions 

about their social life and 

future involvement in student 

organizations. 
And, 
in 
the 

face of recent controversies 

surrounding Greek life both on 

campus and nationally, lifting 

some of the pressure to join the 

Greek 
community 
freshmen 

often face could have long-

lasting benefits.

From the Daily: Winter rush, 
step in the right direction

Just over a month ago, I 

contributed to a Michigan Daily 

Editorial Board article on the 

COVID-19 outbreak, a piece which 

primarily warned the community 

not to panic. In light of recent 

events, it’s almost surreal to 

think about sitting in that room 

now, jokingly passing around 

hand 
sanitizer 
and 
casually 

discussing what I then believed 

to be a novel issue that would not 

have any major impact on life at 

the University of Michigan. And 

coverage did die down, for a time. 

But now, COVID-19 seems to be 

the only thing anyone is talking 

about — and for good reason. 

On 
Wednesday, 
March 
11, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
announced 
on 

Twitter that all classes on the 

University’s 
three 
campuses 

would be canceled for March 

12 and 13 and would move to an 

online format from March 16 

through the end of the semester. 

Events of more than 100 people 

were canceled, along with all 

spring and summer study abroad 

programs. This announcement 

followed similar decisions by 

schools 
across 
the 
country, 

including 
the 
University 
of 

Washington, Harvard University 

and Michigan State University. 

Also on Wednesday, the World 

Health 
Organization 
declared 

the coronavirus outbreak to be a 

global pandemic as it continues 

to spread rapidly. Sporting and 

cultural events — including the 

2020 NCAA men’s and women’s 

basketball tournaments — are 

continually being postponed or 

canceled, and on March 12 Gov. 

Gretchen Whitmer announced all 

Michigan K-12 schools will close 

through at least April 5. All of this 

demonstrates how COVID-19, a 

story I and many others thought 

would be lost to the 24-hour news 

cycle, has rapidly developed to 

impact life on campus, in Ann 

Arbor and across the world 

in a massive and seemingly 

unprecedented way.

Despite 
everything 
that’s 

happened in the past few days, 

however, I stand by the original 

message 
the 
Editorial 
Board 

published in February — don’t 

panic. This is easier said than 

done when it feels like the world 

is crumbling around you. It 

certainly seems that way for me. 

As a junior transfer, my limited 

time at the University has been 

cut even shorter and the social 

network I was growing has 

been blunted. My spring study 

abroad is canceled and I won’t 

be spending this March making 

brackets or watching games. Of 

course, COVID-19 is much greater 

than any individual biography. 

With this outbreak playing out 

on such an expansive — indeed, 

global — scale, broad actions must 

be taken. Likewise, something 

widespread is being revealed. 

This viral event is highlighting 

the fundamental errors in the 

way we live and the way our 

societies are structured. If we pay 

close attention to what is being 

uncovered 
and 
respond 
with 

meaningful action, the COVID-

19 outbreak can be a learning 

opportunity.

The development of COVID-

19 has coincided with the 2020 

presidential 
primaries, 
and 

one of the key talking points 

in the goal to unseat President 

Donald Trump is health care 

reform. Sen. Bernard Sanders, 

I-Vt., argues this outbreak has 

shown America the necessity of 

adopting Medicare for All. When 

a health crisis has the potential 

to impact everyone, it becomes 

clear 
that 
everyone 
should 

have 
access 
to 
high-quality 

care. While some insurers have 

pledged to cover the cost of the 

coronavirus test, the expense 

of further testing and treatment 

that will accompany a positive 

result may prevent individuals 

from seeking the care they need. 

Moreover, 
not 
everyone 
has 

access to health insurance — in 

2018, 27.5 million Americans 

were 
uninsured. 
And 
many 

of those with insurance have 

prohibitively expensive barriers 

to accessing coverage, such as 

high deductibles, copays and 

out-of-network costs, all factors 

which are especially salient given 

the current economic crisis that 

has accompanied COVID-19. 

Even long before the outbreak 

began, the American health care 

structure has been shaping how 

this or any other public health 

concern would play out. Millions 

of Americans are denied the 

preventive care and knowledge 

that 
could 
support 
improved 

outcomes in a crisis, such as 

regular check-ups and diagnoses 

of 
chronic 
or 
underlying 

conditions. Health care is a 

human right and no one should be 

denied the opportunity to achieve 

their best health — or survive 

a pandemic — based on their 

socioeconomic status. COVID-

19 has fully exposed the flaws 

of a largely private insurance 

market and an overpriced medical 

system. It has given us evidence 

of an urgent need to entirely 

restructure how we design and 

distribute health care. 

Beyond treating coronavirus, 

the 
wide-scale 
preventative 

measures enacted to slow the 

disease’s spread provide a chance 

at a re-evaluation of how we work 

in America. Several of the world’s 

largest 
companies, 
including 

Michigan-headquartered 
Ford 

and General Motors, tech giants 

Amazon and Google and financial 

firms 
JPMorgan 
Chase 
and 

Goldman Sachs, have instituted 

work-from-home 
policies 
for 

at least some employees. Like 

the 
University, 
a 
substantial 

number of academic institutions 

are 
transitioning 
to 
remote 

learning. It seems COVID-19 

has finally motivated the world’s 

largest 
and 
most 
influential 

institutions to consider policies 

that disability advocates have 

been pushing: more expansive, 

accessible 
work-from-home 

policies. These remote policies 

can spur innovation which will 

shape a more accessible working 

landscape 
for 
all 
people 
of 

varying abilities. We can discover 

that it is entirely possible to be 

productive from home — for some, 

it may be far more productive 

than sitting in an office. We can 

build a more flexible schedule in 

which productivity is not limited 

from nine-to-five. We can even 

reconstruct 
the 
concept 
of 

productivity, acknowledging the 

importance of work across the 

gamut of pay grades and pushing 

for living wages. 

Of course, not all work can 

realistically be done remotely 

— retail and customer service 

are notable examples. For these 

roles, we must mandate paid 

sick leave, as illness should not 

prevent one from making rent or 

putting dinner on the table. In 

customer-facing roles, especially 

those involving food, people 

should not be working when 

sick — for their own health and 

for the health of others. Across 

the board, we must normalize 

the often-chastised concept of 

taking a sick day. Our current 

working 
environment 
pushes 

for self-sacrifice for the goal 

of productivity, but a rapidly 

spreading and potentially deadly 

virus is a grave reminder of our 

limited time and the importance 

of prioritizing the well-being 

of ourselves and of others over 

monetary gains. This outbreak is 

a call to reconsider how we view 

work in our global society and to 

rediscover a healthier work-life 

balance.

COVID-19 is having radical 

impacts 
on 
both 
local 
and 

global communities, and the 

ramifications will be felt for 

years to come, fundamentally 

changing the way we live. And 

where there is change, there 

is opportunity. It’s absolutely 

justified to feel like the world 

is falling apart and to have the 

associated panic for a period of 

time — my now-private Twitter 

feed 
is 
a 
primary 
example. 

But if we adopt a mindset of 

acknowledging 
the 
flaws 
of 

modernity which COVID-19 has 

brought center-stage and strive 

to take action in response, we 

may emerge from the chaos on 

the path to a society that is more 

fair and equitable than the one 

we had before. In this period 

of temporary social distancing, 

it’s especially critical to keep in 

mind that it’s not me, it’s us. Let’s 

capitalize on this opportunity 

to think and act radically for a 

better future. This contemplative 

approach 
is 
imperative 
to 

emerging 
successfully 
from 

COVID-19 — along with washing 

our hands for at least 20 seconds.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


November has come and gone, 

and Yandhi left with it. Despite 
enthusiastic 
words 
from 
Kim 

Kardashian, it was no surprise that 
Kanye West’s supposed ninth studio 
album did not appear on streaming 
services this Black Friday, a fact his 
legions had earlier been forced to 
come to terms with after Mr. West 
took to Twitter to go back on his 
wife’s promise.

All signs point to Yandhi being a 

spiritual sequel of sorts to Kanye’s 
2013 output, Yeezus (the similar 
title and cover art are the biggest 
clues), but taking into account how 
much Kanye’s career trajectory has 
changed in the half decade since 
the release of Yeezus, this act of 
continuation all seems a farce.

If there’s one thing Kanye has 

done well, it’s constantly evolving 
and pushing boundaries as an 
artist while still keeping everything 
precisely Kanye. Prior to this year’s 
ye, each of his albums ushered in a 
distinct era for the man: in his music, 
his fashion, his character. The best 
part of this was that Kanye always 
seemed to know when to pivot, when 
rockstar Kanye or soulful Kanye had 
overstayed their welcome, and to 
break down, rebuild and rebrand.

I would argue that no Kanye album 

ever needs a sequel. (Yes, I know The 
College Dropout, Late Registration 
and Graduation form a trilogy of 
sorts, but while thematically and 
slightly musically similar, they all 
have their own defining sound and 
Kanye himself was a much different 
person in 2004 than he was in 2007). 
And therein lies the core frustration 
with Yandhi. Any attempt to recreate 
the minimalist panache of Yeezus 
will result in failure. Yeezus is the 
culmination of every Kanye West 
we’ve ever known and every album 
he has ever offered, combined and 
distilled to the barest form. It is 
Kanye at his most complete.

Setting 
the 
contemporary 

politics of Kanye aside for the 
slightest moment, what little he 
has revealed about Yandhi spells 
unfulfillment. Starting with the two 
aforementioned chains which bind 
it to Yeezus, the name and the cover, 
one can infer the only reason for the 
similarity was to drive hype, in the 
same way that the first release date 
we got (“9 29 18”) turned out to be a 
ploy to get the Kanye faithful to tune 
into a “Saturday Night Live” season 
premiere the same day, trading high 
attention and ratings for a surreal 
performance of “I Love It” with 
Lil Pump. But, in order to dive into 
Yandhi, one first has to understand 
Yeezus and what it represents, and 
what happened to Kanye in the 
meantime.

Yeezus’s cover, or lack thereof, 

is the perfect primer to the musical 

equivalent of a dental drill which lies 
within. As noted in a phenomenal 
Daily article regarding the album’s 
relationship with architecture and 
an interview Kanye did with The 
New York Times, Yeezus was in part 
recorded in an acoustically terrible 
Paris apartment, forcing the songs 
“to be super simple, because if you 
turned up some complicated sound 
and a track with too much bass, it’s 
not going to work in that space.” The 
cover is perhaps the simplest it can 
be, and speaking about the sparse 
promotion of the album Kanye 
echoes the same sentiment: “Shit, we 
ain’t even got no cover. We just made 
some real music.”

Regardless of the critical art 

theory lens through which the 
cover can be viewed, it’s clear that 
sound is Yeezus’s main, and perhaps 
only, focus. Which is almost ironic 
considering it came during the 
peak of Kanye’s arrogance: The 
days of VMA-interrupting Kanye, 
whom Barack Obama even freely 
called a jackass, had somehow been 
eclipsed, replaced with a man who 
appeared to have seen it all, teetering 
between insanity and earnestness 
as he drilled hours of apocalyptic 
gospel and sublime self-affirmation 
to unready radio hosts. So, when you 
hear this variant of Kanye is releasing 
an album comparing himself to a 
savior revered by billions of people 
right from the title, you can’t help but 
roll your eyes, all while buckling up 
for the absolute.

And Yeezus immediately thrusts 

you into a car crash, as “On Sight” is 
every part abrasive and boundary-
pushing while still retaining a certain 
charm, everything a Kanye song 
should be. The industrial soundscape 
of this introduction is interrupted 
halfway by something that defined 
early Kanye (what is “soul,” Alex?) 
when the synthesizers give way to 
a choir chanting “He’ll give us what 
we need / it may not be what we 
want.” This austere contrast of “On 
Sight” is a microcosm of Yeezus in 
its entirety: the intersection between 
harsh noise and soothing melodies, 
Kanye honing his craft of dredging 
up the most obscure yet pertinent 
samples and music as the starkest 
representation of the self.

There is no defining sound of 

Yeezus other than abstract sound 
itself. The sirens and distortion 
of “Send It Up” make it a more 
approachable “On Sight;” “Black 
Skinhead” would fit right in with 
Graduation and My Beautiful Dark 
Twisted Fantasy’s stadium rap 
anthems, save the zealous manifesto 
against the establishment and its 
racism; and “Guilt Trip” and its Kid 
Cudi croons feel an extension of 
the love and loss present on 808s & 
Heartbreak. Each song starts with 
a single sound, be it the soft press 
of a piano key or a grisly drone, and 
then takes that sound and smashes 
it open, layering the space inside 

with Kanye’s vocals and stripped-
down drum patterns. And while 
Yeezus definitely pulls from the prior 
discography, it is as much a synthesis 
as it is a reconstruction.

The primary instrument of the 

album is the voice, whether that of 
Kanye, a collaborating artist or a 
sample. The artist’s full vocal range 
is on display, from his booming, 
grumbling bars on “I Am A God” 
to the auto-tuned trill found late 
in “Blood On The Leaves.” It is 
underpinned by a wealth of other 
singers and rappers: Chief Keef, 
Frank Ocean and Bon Iver, to name a 
few. The prolific samples themselves 
take on a life of their own, as Kanye 
and 
his 
legendary 
production 

team revive everything from Nina 
Simone’s rendition of “Strange 
Fruit” to a Hungarian rock power 
ballad. The kicker? The only official 
featured artist is God himself. Kanye 
is at the absolute forefront, asserting 
himself as the divinely untouchable 
and smashing open the musical ore 
to reveal 10 disparate crystals and 
their translucent mystery.

Yeezus is at the same time 

everything 
and 
nothing, 
an 

amalgamation and a destruction. 
I’ve talked about the progression of 
Kanye in a way that could make him 
seem like some “Split”-esque host for 
multiple personalities, whereas in 
reality all of these different Kanyes 
are just manifestations of some facet 
of his personality blown up to larger-
than-life proportions. Work with me 
here, but consider Kanye West as 
a cow: Each cut of meat represents 
the Kanye associated with a specific 
album. They all vary in flavor and 
tenderness, but at their core they 
are all the same, all some sort of 
beef. Yeezus is the meat grinder into 
which everything was shoved in an 
attempt to make the perfect blend, 
employing each cut’s idiosyncratic 
taste and cutting out the fat.

But what do you do with the sonic 

sausage that pops out of the grinder? 
In The Life of Pablo’s case, you 
throw it in the trash. Yeezus broke 
Kanye’s music down and fashioned 
together something more complete 
with the resultant shards, but Pablo 
shattered everything completely. It’s 
hard to expand on perfect, so Kanye 
did what any perfectionist would 
do. He started anew on the quest to 
reach perfection, again. And with 
this blank slate, Kanye continued 
to find ways to innovate, literally 
going beyond the boundaries of an 
album. While it’s completely valid to 
dismiss The Life of Pablo as messy 
and unfinished (“Ima fix wolves”), 
the constant updates and abstract, 
jagged nature of it make sense when 
you view it as, in Kanye’s words, “a 
living breathing changing creative 
expression.”

Surely the second coming 
of ‘Yeezus’ is at hand

“Lady Bird” is now the highest 

rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes. 
Ever. It’s also quite possibly the 
most wonderful movie. Ever. But 
universal acclaim hasn’t saved 
Greta Gerwig’s masterpiece from a 
serving of hot (and very bad) takes.

Recently, an article popped up on 

my Twitter: “’Lady Bird’ and Cycles 
of Abuse,” in which the writer poses 
an argument that “Lady Bird” is not 
a careful portrait of the complexities 
of a mother-daughter relationship, 
but in fact a story about maternal 
abuse.

This is, of course, wrong. And I 

won’t dedicate much more space 
to the ways in which someone 
named “Jim” missed the nuances 
and complexities of the mother-
daughter relationship in “Lady 
Bird” (except to say that he missed 
them all). But his misstep did get me 
thinking about everything “Lady 
Bird” gets right.

Gerwig gets all the details of 

semi-suburban adolescence correct: 
the defiant rejection of Catholic 
school communion, the popular 
girl’s Range Rover, the sensitive 
(and closeted) heartthrob’s puka 
shell necklace. Justin Timberlake 
plays at a party where the parents 
are upstairs, but “they don’t care if 
we drink.”

All those little, carefully chosen 

details create a world that is both 
factually and emotionally real. The 
emotional reality comes from the 
delicacy and honesty with which 
Gerwig handles her character’s 
relationships.

There is no “good” and “bad” in 

“Lady Bird.” We don’t want Lady 
Bird to win against (or despite of) 
her mother or Danny or even Kyle 
or Jenna. Because none of those 
characters, though they make life 
harder for our heroine, are bad. 
And even Lady Bird can fluctuate 
between cruelty and compassion, 

often within the same scene.

Lady 
Bird 
and 
Marion’s 

relationship is built on this duality. 
In one scene, Lady Bird can grab a 
notepad and demand her mother 
tell her how much it costs to raise 
her so she can one day pay her back 
and “never have to see her again,” 
and in another see Marion pick up 
that same pad and struggle to write 
a letter to her daughter as she gets 
ready to leave for college.

And we can understand that 

those actions are both attempts 
at the impossible but inevitable 
process of separation. Lady Bird 
will leave Marion, and sometime in 
the distant but approaching future, 
Marion will leave Lady Bird. And 
neither one of them can be ready for 
either departure.

Before Lady Bird leaves, Marion 

scrambles to prepare her for the 
unknowable beast that is the world 
outside her home. And through 
that rushed preparation, “You’re 
dragging your feet” becomes a 
different way of saying “I love you.”

That moment — which comes up 

twice during the course of the film 
— as the two shop for dresses, is one 
of the most obviously recognizable 
for any mother or daughter. I went 
to prom in 2015 as opposed to 2002, 
so after my mom and I fought in 
a department store I went home 
and bought my dress online. That 
act — choosing a dress without 
my mom — is in the same family 
as Lady Bird choosing to go to 
Danny’s Thanksgiving or hiding her 
college process from her mother. 
It’s a conscious act of exclusion that 
serves as preparation for a time in 
the near future when that type of 
inclusion won’t always be an option.

Lady Bird and her mother spend 

the movie creating space between 
each other. They push each other 
away, but they rarely — save Lady 
Bird’s dramatic exit in the first scene 
— try to escape each other. They 
fight, but stay in the same room 
after.

That’s why Marion’s silence isn’t 

abusive and her criticism isn’t cruel. 
It must be a complicated brand of 
love to prepare your child to leave 
you. Marion wants Lady Bird to be 
the best version of herself she can be 
so she tells her to stand up straight 
and hang up her uniform and apply 
to in-state colleges.

What it takes for Marion’s wish 

to be fulfilled is for Lady Bird to fly 
the nest.

I talk about my mother now in a 

way my 18 or even 20-year-old self 
could never imagine. With a kind of 
love and reverence and frequency 
that I didn’t realize was in such 
opposition to the way I used to talk 
about her until I saw the movie.

I talk about her the way Lady Bird 

starts to at the end of the film. She 
spends the film rejecting everything 
her mother has given her—her 
name, her hair color—and then 
finally, miles away from her mother, 
she starts taking them back.

And that concession of guilt, that 

apology, is an impossible one to 
articulate. So, when she calls Marion 
at the end of the film all she can say 
is: “Did you get emotional the first 
time you drove in Sacramento?”

And we get it. That in itself is a 

kind of apology for a kind of cruelty 
that doesn’t always warrant one. It’s 
a reconnection that tries to do yet 
another impossible thing: make up 
for lost time.

Now, older and wiser, I look back 

on the anger my high school self spit 
at my mother and I regret it. I regret 
all the hours of silence and fights 
in the car and times I slammed my 
door. But I know I couldn’t change 
it.

The stage after teen angst doesn’t 

have a good name. Existential dread, 
maybe? My twenties? Whatever this 
thing is called, I’m in it. And, at the 
end of the movie, “Lady Bird” is 
entering it. Picking up the pieces of 
the things our mothers gave us that 
we threw away and trying to say 
sorry, without being able — of course 
— to actually say it.

2017 Senior Arts Editor

I have a crush on Rachel 

Kushner — everything about her. 
I was initially turned on by her 
debut novel “The Flamethrowers,” 
a smart and stylish sojourn from 
the dirty art hoes of 1970s Soho to 
the political underground of Italy, 
complete with glamorous touches 
of DMT churches, performance 
art and street violence. Swoon.

“The Flamethrowers” is so 

vivid, so bitingly electric and 
feminist-without-the-word 
that 

I got curious about the woman 
behind the pen and slipped into 
a 
forty 
minute 
biographical 

research bender. Rachel Kushner 
is a San Francisco native, the 
certain spawn of beatnik scientists 
that lands a gig at a feminist 
bookstore at the ripe age of five, 
does the Berkeley thing and bools 
around the SF nightclub scene on 
her Moto Guzzi before casually 
saucing over to Columbia for her 
MFA. In author imagery, she often 
appears in front of cars, behind 
Wayfarers and/or clad in leather. 
She’s got three critically acclaimed 
blockbuster novels, a Guggenheim, 
an honorary PhD from Kalamazoo 
and now a spot on the Man Booker 
shortlist with her latest book, “The 
Mars Room.” I repeat: swoon.

“The Mars Room” reads much 

like “The Flamethrowers” in its 

grunge-glamor. Our femme fatale, 
Romy Hall, grew up hard and 
fast in San Francisco, getting into 
catfights and PCP on the weekends 
before working at The Mars Room, 
a low-fi but high-cred strip club in 
the gritty Tenderloin district. It’s 
not a stereotypically secure gig, but 
Romy enjoys the power she wields 
at the club and a steady source of 
income to support herself and her 
son. She’s smart, pragmatic and 
tough (“Every stripper I know 
is clever. Some are practically 
geniuses.”), but she doesn’t have 
the ability to prevent or outrun a 
customer-turned-stalker, and she 
really doesn’t have the cultural 
capital or capital-capital to defend 
herself at court when an encounter 
with the creep turns violent. But 
this is all delivered to us through 
sporadic flashbacks. The novel 
opens in the thick of consequence: 
Romy shackled chattel-style to a 
prison bus, careening nebulously 
into two consecutive life sentences 
in the Central Valley.

“The Mars Room” unfolds like 

this, unsticking and resticking 
in time between its present 
(2003 at the Stanville Women’s 
Correctional Facility) and Romy’s 
shrouded past on the streets 
of SF. Structurally, this can be 
unpopular territory: Novels that 
nix the frameworks of time and 
place run the risk of bleeding out 
into disorganized and disorienting 
masses 
of 
detail. 
Kushner, 

however, is a seasoned rebel. 
She manipulates the timeline 
so deftly that these scenes slide 
into each other with a dreamlike 
logic. Romy’s GED prep session at 
Stanville summons an anecdote 
of teaching her son to count, a 
memory that morphs into musing 
on how counting functions “like 
prison, from a name to a number.” 
This brings us back to Stanville 
where the women on death row 
are sewing sandbags for “five cents 
an hour, minus fifty-five percent 
restitution.” 

The narrative is a ride on Romy’s 

train of thought, a psychological 
portrait made vivid by its very 
meandering. Between the hustle 
for shampoo and tampons, hazy 
recollections of bad lap dances 
and 
dehumanizing 
treatment 

from prison guards and public 
defenders alike, Kushner captures 
the indefinite restlessness of a 
mind pinned between past and 
future, time and place, hope and 
regret. 

That being said, “The Mars 

Room” sprawls. Those who value 
plot will be frustrated with the 
way this one constantly wavers 
between 
absent 
and 
forced. 

Those who enjoy form and detail 
will revel in Kushner’s obsession 
with it, a highly visual approach 
to storytelling singular enough 
to land her on the Man Booker 
shortlist.

Four years ago, I had assumed 

that my parents were complete 

animal enthusiasts. They came 

home every night after long 

shifts at our restaurant seemingly 

eager to turn on Animal Planet. 

My mom would call me over to 

watch, giggling at the frenzied 

yet astute organization of meerkat 

manors. My dad would gawk at the 

ferocious pace of lionesses chasing 

zebras across the Serengeti. At 

garage sales, he could never 

resist bringing home a stack of 

National Geographic magazines. 

We’ve housed nearly every animal 

allowed as a pet by the state of 

Michigan.

I was obviously wrong.

It’s 
clear 
today 
that 
they 

could not care less. My parents 

cheer enthusiastically at “Sing! 

China” and other knock-off music 

competitions. 
The 
browsing 

history of our home computer is 

filled with 2000s-esque online 

tabloids 
divulging 
the 
latest 

Asian celebrity scandal. Their 

smartphones 
constantly 
blow 

up with WeChat pings from 

their friends across the world. 

There are no more Discovery 

Channel 
specials 
documenting 

the inscrutable beauty of wild 

dolphins; instead, now my parents 

only discover the “unbelievable” 

talent of the Dolphin Princess. 

They spend hours glued to a 

screen, eyes welling up when 

prompted and laughing exactly 

as scripted. It’s the mindless 

media every baby boomer life 

coach warns against. But this was 

exactly what I wanted.

There’s a charming simplicity 

and boredom to life in the 

American 
Midwest. 
It’s 
the 

birthplace of the five-day work 

week, the 9 to 5 shift and church 

on Sunday. My parents, however, 

were never part of this simple life. 

They arrived by boat, uneducated, 

unskilled and unable to speak 

a lick of English. They opened 

a small takeout restaurant in 

western Michigan, where they 

worked endless hours to support 

our family in the New World. Our 

restaurant is among the oldest in 

the city; my grandma’s garden 

in the front earned it a mention 

in the Muskegon Chronicle. My 

parents’ 
unmistakable 
effort 

and spirit of entrepreneurship 

fits neatly into the myth of the 

American Dream. It’s exactly the 

false consciousness surrounding 

upward mobility — their success 

obscures how so many others are 

failed by the invisible hand, how 

we lived anxiously without health 

insurance, how we became too 

accustomed to armed robberies.

I could count the number of 

Chinese families I know living 

back home with one hand. Though 

it’s a cliché in the coming-of-age 

stories of other Asian/Pacific 

Islander 
American 
kids 
from 

small-town America, I wrestled 

with the sense of “otherness” 

and assimilation. But it was 

during my senior year of high 

school when I began to think, 

what about my parents? While I 

could easily Facetime people on 

the other side of the planet, they 

were still buying international 

calling cards to reconnect for 

mere minutes with their friends 

back home. In 2013, my parents 

had never logged onto a computer; 

they had never sent a text message 

over the phone. To be frank, they 

were ignorant, but perhaps not in 

bliss. Were they bored? Were they 

lonely these last 20-or-so years? 

Maybe my dad kept replaying the 

same CDs because he had no idea 

where to find new Chinese music. 

Maybe they spent so much time 

watching wildlife because those 

programs didn’t require English 

comprehension.

After lobbying my parents for 

months, they finally bought a 

computer. I sought their digital 

enlightenment. They could chat 

instantly 
with 
their 
friends 

across the world. With Google 

Maps, they could retrace their 

old neighborhoods back in China. 

Though they were comfortable 

with the fact that my brother and 

I had been surfing the internet 

for years, they were ferociously 

resistant to idea that they do the 

same. “We’re too old for this!” 

they’d complain — an excuse 

too 
common 
in 
immigrant 

households.

From 
the 
mundane 
like 

translating during grocery trips 

to the complex like explaining 

tax forms, there are numerous 

moments 
where 
immigrant 

children become the parents. It 

was humiliating for my parents 

to have established a thriving 

business, only to struggle to use 

a keyboard. I’d sit with them 

for hours at a time, guiding 

their mouse across the browser. 

Sometimes when they got it (the 

red “x” means exit), I’d see a 

childlike sense of accomplishment 

spread across their faces. But, 

inevitably, we’d get frustrated. 

We’d argue. They’d call me a si zai 

(Guangdong Province insult of a 

person who should’ve died when 

they were born). I’d tell them 

“I can’t do this anymore!” We’d 

storm off, only later to return — no 

apologies — and simply try again.

Soon, 
they 
became 
semi-

proficient. They could turn the 

computer on and off and learned 

to open Google Chrome. It was 

good enough. Understanding how 

to browse the internet was their 

watershed moment. And before I 

left for Ann Arbor, they wanted 

smartphones with WeChat and 

Weibo, a way to stream Chinese 

cable, and instructions on how to 

download music. I have a disdain 

for mass media, but when my 

mother received her first WeChat 

voicemails from childhood friends 

who asked, “Yan Li! What took 

you so long???” and I saw the 

excitement and joy that raced 

through her existence, I decided 

I’ll always put aside my thoughts 

for them.

One day, my mom caught me 

off guard while I was home for 

Fall Break. She had prepared a 

simple, nostalgic lunch for my 

return: steamed rice with la chang 

(Chinese sausage). As she watched 

me eat, she remarked, “They gave 

our restaurant four out of five 

stars.” The reviews. Who told 

her? For every one bad review, 

there are 20 other to drown them 

out, but everyone, my parents 

included, wants to hear criticism. 

I was annoyed and surprised that 

she had discovered the online 

reviews of our restaurant on her 

own. Perhaps her friend Rose 

from Milwaukee told her about 

it. We chatted about how our 

competitors were only three stars 

and how some restaurants didn’t 

even show up. She was surprised 

that people even liked the food 

in the first place and then joked 

about how funny life was where 

two Chinese “peasants” could 

become successful in America. 

Playing into her humble boast, 

I pretended to be delightfully 

shocked.

“Hunter, can you translate the 

reviews for me?”
Thank God I never taught her 
how to use Google Translate. 
If you’ve interpreted languages 
before, you know the three most 
important things are syntax, 
meaning and context. But it only 
matters if you’re trying to be 
truthful.
I, 
like 
other 
children 
of 
immigrants, chose to lie to my 
parents.
The language barrier that 
had been the root of so much 
childhood 
self-hatred 
and 
embarrassment 
became 
my 
saving grace. I never thought 
that teaching my parents to use 
a computer could ever backfire. 
Right now, my mom doesn’t know 
how to translate and read the 
reviews, but eventually she will. 
She’ll get better on the computer. 
She’ll discover that she doesn’t 
need me. And she’ll read them.
My 
parents 
didn’t 
come 
here to run a Michelin-starred 
restaurant; they came here to give 
their children a better chance at 
life. Leaving their dreams behind, 
they provided me the ultimate 
opportunity to pursue mine: a life 
free from poverty and oppression. 
I can never fully describe the 
sacrifices they made, the barriers 

they overcame. Even if hot 
vegetable oil burns and blisters 
my arms — just like my father’s — 
from stir-frying “cheap” takeout 
food for self-proclaimed Chinese 
culinary experts, my life is still 
better than it would have been.
Instead of a conspiracy of 
ripping 
off 
customers 
with 
“garbage food,” maybe we don’t 
accept credit cards because my 
parents don’t know how to use 
them. Maybe the girl who “is a 
complete moron” struggles on 
the phone because we didn’t have 
money for English lessons. Maybe 
it “is not Chinese at all” because 
actual Chinese people don’t eat 
General Tso’s Chicken as their 
plat principal with a fortune 
cookie as dessert.
Maybe 
the 
reason 
why 
our white rice is “excellent” 
isn’t because we followed the 
directions on some bag. It’s 
because my parents learned to 
cook it perfectly when it was the 
only thing their families could 
afford. That every last morsel 
mattered back then. That even 
when you burned it, you scraped 
the charred bottom crust and ate 
it to ease the pain of hunger. That 
before my dad was even a teenager 
— his house stripped bare by the 
government, his parents sent 
to labor camps, his older sisters 
deported 
for 
“reeducation,” 
his family blacklisted by the 

community and the survival of 
two siblings left in his hands alone 
— he would wait outside homes in 
the middle of the night to wait his 
turn to dig through their trash 
and find smashed remnants of 
soured, rotten white rice, bring 
it home to soak it in water so 
that the ants would float up top 
to be poured away, and fed to his 
younger brother and sister so they 
wouldn’t starve. He’d eagerly eat 
what was left of the rancid slurry.
How can a single comment so 
effectively, so easily erase the 
histories of my family? In this 
digital age, anonymity begets 
such cold cruelty. And in truth, I 
can’t bring myself to blame them. 
It’d be unrealistic to demand that 
customers censor their thoughts 
— they have the right to express 
a 
bad 
experience. 
Honestly, 
the comments people leave for 
our restaurant are hilariously 
creative. 
Nevertheless, 
as 
the restaurant owners’ son, I 
can’t help but overreact at the 
ignorance and insensitivity of 
these comments. I can’t help but 
be defensive.
They probably wrote those 
reviews in less than two minutes, 
mindlessly thumbing characters, 
uncaring about who the audience 
was and what the impact would 
be. Four out of five stars doesn’t 
just represent the success of our 
restaurant; it’s validation of my 

parents’ lives — their journey, 
their challenge, their success.
I know I shouldn’t be worked 
up. I know these comments mean 
nothing. I know my mom is a 
lion, strongest among beasts and 
turns away from no one. Even if 
I translated them faithfully, she’d 
probably be fine; but I have a 
brutal sense of protection towards 
my family. I would never let 
anything, not even the minutiae of 
online restaurant reviews, come 
close or even attempt to chip away 
at their accomplishments.
I will never.
“Mom, they love the food. They 
said everything was affordable 
and delicious.”
Her ears perk up. She sets her 
eyes on me, her subtle smile clear. 
She’s proud — a pride distinct 
from reading any kind of review. 
She’s proud to have kept her end 
of the immigrant bargain and 
prouder that I’m about to keep 
mine. Come April, I will no longer 
be 
a 
first-generation 
college 
student; I’ll be an alum. 
After 
my 
graduation, 
our 
restaurant 
will 
finally 
close 
its doors having achieved its 
purpose.
I wish I didn’t have to lie, but 
then again, I am her stubborn and 
selfish American son. No more 
translations of reviews. “There’s 
no need,” I constantly assure her. 
“Nothing has changed.” Because 

Following 
the 
Black 

Lives 
Matter 
protests 
and 

demonstrations of the past few 

weeks, my African American 

studies professor gave students 

the platform to have a discussion 

in class about how the racial 

tension on campus has been 

affecting our lives. After many of 

the Black students bravely shared 

their stories aloud, shed tears and 

expressed how dehumanizing and 

degrading being called a racial 

slur can make a person, better 

yet, a community feel, a white 

female student decided to speak 

up. She said (roughly quoting): 

“It breaks my heart to hear that 

when stuff like this happens it 

can remain on the backs of the 

Black students for the remainder 

of their day or week or even for 

years. It breaks my heart because 

I know that even though I am sad 

about it, I can leave today and 

remain totally unaffected and 

continue with my day. That is due 

in part to the privilege that I have 

as a white person. It allows me to 

remain unaffected and ignorant 

to what is going on with other 

people in my own community.”

Her statement shook me to 

the core. For the first time since 

I have been on campus, I heard 

a white person admit to the 

privilege of indifference. The 

privilege of neutrality in times of 

racial crisis.

This mindset of neutrality is 

one that privileged whites tend 

to have in the United States (and 

on this campus) regarding race. 

White people who choose not 

to be a part of the conversation 

of 
racial 
tension 
and 
who 

would rather “not take a side” 

perpetuate an endless cycle of 

aggression and attack.

From a distance, it may seem 

as if most of the white students 

do not see what is happening on 

campus. It seems that they are 

totally oblivious to our struggle. 

However, I have found that the 

issues we as people of color 

face are in fact being seen by 

white students on campus but it 

seems that they are only seeing 

us through a TV screen — as if 

these racial attacks are a natural 

disaster 
occurring 
in 
some 

foreign land leaving them totally 

unaffected.

Black 
students 
feel 
as 
if 

they are isolated on an island 

experiencing a calamity and all 

the complacent white students 

act as if all they can do is watch. 

They are not seeing our anguish 

through their own eyes, in their 

own halls, buildings and front 

lawns. They are not feeling our 

pain in their own bodies because 

even hundreds of years after 

being brought to this land, Black 

people still are only seen as 

visitors. As the girl in my class 

said, many white people don’t feel 

personally affected or attacked 

when a Black man is called 

“n*****” because they do not 

view said Black man as a member 

of their community but another 

community completely separate. 

We as Black people are only 

tolerated as guests on a campus 

we have worked equally as hard 

to reside upon. Therefore, when 

something happens to us, the 

urgency of the matter is only our 

issue and no one else’s. It is not 

that these white people are evil 

or would ever themselves attempt 

to dehumanize a person of color, 

it is that they choose to remain 

ignorant to the issues affecting 

people of color and therefore 

choose to remain neutral to any 

remedies.

The only way we can fix what 

is going on here is if we somehow 

make 
the 
complacent 
white 

students, who have no inclination 

toward either side, feel obligated 

to 
defend 
the 
identities 
of 

students of color. They have to 

know that what is happening is 

not fiction. It’s not alien. It’s not 

happening on a TV screen! It’s 

occurring right here and right 

now. The neutral white students 

have to feel personally affected 

when their Black neighbors are 

being attacked and they have 

to view an attack on a person of 

color in this community as an 

attack on everyone.

We can only move forward if 

they know their participation 

is integral to our movement for 

positive social change on campus.

Michigan advances to Sweet 16 on Jordan Poole buzzer-beating prayer

Somehow, some way.
His legs flailing each and every direction 

and a defender square in his face, Jordan 
Poole caught a pass on the right wing from 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
and 

hoisted a prayer.

And as the ball found sweet nylon, the 

prayer was granted — somehow, some way 
— in the wee hours of Sunday morning. 
The freshman guard darted to the opposite 
side of the court, greeted by the rest of 
his jubialant team as they celebrated an 
astonishing 64-63 win.

It was a miracle on the Great Plains the 

likes of which will live in Michigan lore 
right alongside the Trey Burke shot and the 
Denard Robinson pass at Under the Lights 
I.

“I was thirsty,” Poole told a swath of 

reporters after the game. “Definitely 
thirsty. Because I’ve been hitting shots 
like that in practice all year. I just felt like I 
always wanted to be in a situation like that 
at the end in the game, and my teammates 
constantly tell me that I’ve got ice in my 
veins.

“I definitely dreamed about this a long 

time. Actually, before I went out there on 
there, I thought, ‘What if I hit this shot right 
now as a freshman?’ ”

And that he did. On this stage. With 

these implications. Somehow, some way, 
the only player with the personality to 
match the grand moment found the ball 
with 0.8 seconds and a season teetering in 
the balance.

Now Michigan will head to Los Angeles 

next weekend to play its fourth Sweet 
Sixteen game in six years on the back of 
a monstrous defense and one lucky St. 
Patrick’s Day heave.

“I don’t have any words for that one,” 

said fifth-year senior Duncan Robinson. 
“It’s incredible. That’s all I got.”

Somehow, some way.
For much of the game, though, there 

appeared to be no way.

For the second consecutive game, 

Michigan’s offense fell victim to offensive 
lulls that threatened its survival in the 
NCAA Tournament. The Wolverines went 
to the first TV timeout once again without a 
made field goal, this time trailing 6-1, having 
missed their first seven shots including six 
threes.

Robinson broke the seal nearly six 

minutes in, nailing a deep three with a 
hand in his face. He did it again on the next 
possession, pumping up his bench on the 
gallop back down the court.

That was the tone all night, on both sides 

— a tough, physical street fight. It’s a style 
Michigan has come to relish this season.

For all the talk about Cougars guard Rob 

Gray offensively — coming off a 39-point 
performance against San Diego State 
— it was the defense on both ends that 
controlled the game.

Gray, the alpha and omega of Houston’s 

offense, couldn’t find his rhythm in the first 
half, thanks to a swarming defensive effort 
from Michigan guards Zavier Simpson and 
Abdur-Rahkman. Gray finished with 23, 
but on 8-of-22 shooting.

“We just tried to limit his threes, make 

him score tough twos,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said. “He made a lot of them, but that’s all 
you can really do, is try to force him into 
contested shots.”

On the flip side, a physical Houston 

man defense held the Wolverines in check, 
stifling Michigan’s pick-and-roll action 
with athleticism, holding it so just 30 
percent from the field. By the end of the 
game, a dejected Wolverines bench thought 
that would be the culprit of its dying season.

“They were down because we did some 

things that aren’t winning basketball today 
— just a few, but just enough,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “But credit Houston. 
They made us make some of those plays.”

At half, the game was tied at 28, those 

struggles leaving the game back where it 
started, just with a few more bumps and 
bruises.

And while the bumps and bruises didn’t 

subside, the lid on the buckets slowly did.

Then, it was game on.
With 17 lead changes and 12 ties in total, 

neither team took firm control until Gray 
began to come to life midway through the 
half. He scored eight of his team’s 10 points 
at one point, nabbing a six point lead with 
10:43 left on an inexplicably wide-open 
three.

But the see-saw swung right back. 

Michigan 
fought 
through 
recurring 

offensive demons, finishing the game with 
just 36 percent shooting. 

And it has more than just one fortuitous 

bounce to thank for the escape.

Down 51-46 with just over five minutes 

left, Matthews shot a 3-pointer off the back 
of the rim. It careened high into the air and 
through the hoop just as a Houston forward 
was whistled for a foul. Teske made both 
free throws, and suddenly a 51-46 game 
became 51-51 in only a single possession.

The teams traded blows from there, with 

the Cougars grabbing what seemed to be 
the final lead with 44 seconds left on two 
free-throws from forward Devin Davis.

But that wasn’t the last of Michigan’s 

season. It just couldn’t be. There was a little 
more than a strong breeze flowing through 
Intrust Bank Arena on Saturday night. 
Sophomore center Jon Teske could just feel 
it.

“I actually told CJ (Baird), I didn’t think 

we were gonna go home,” Teske said. “I felt 
something special was going to happen and 
I’m just glad he knocked that down. … It’s 
something I will always remember.”

And in a wild back and forth affair, it 

all came down to a howling freshman, 
with the confidence to belt “Ham” — the 
team’s nickname for Abdur-Rahkman — 
with the season on the line. The call was 
“Tennessee,” the same full-court inbound 
play run to beat Maryland early in the 
season as time expired. The senior caught 
the pass at midcourt and then put his season 
and career in the handwwwwwwws of 
Poole, who answered the faith with one of 
the most historic shots in program history.

“I knew they were not going to let me 

shoot the ball. So I was looking for JP,” 
Abdur-Rahkman said. “I knew he could 
knock it down.

“Literally, he makes it all the time in 

practice.”

And as the entire team piled on Poole 

under the hoop, cheers reigned down from 
the traveling Michigan crowd and band.

“It’s great to be a Michigan Wolverine.”

The wins that shaped Michigan’s run

Behind every deep tournament 

run are the wins that shaped the 
team. It was no different for the 
Michigan baseball team’s historic 
– and, at times, improbable – run. 
They don’t tell this team’s whole 
story. Nothing could. But they’re a 
good place to start. The Daily takes 
a look back of some of this season’s 
defining wins.

March 8 – Michigan 7, No. 2 

UCLA 5 

There’s a lot of talk in sports 

about “statement wins.” That’s 
what this was.

In a tough road environment 

against then-No. 2 UCLA, which 
spent most of the season as the 
best team in the country, junior 
left-hander Tommy Henry struck 
out ten over six innings of two-run 
baseball. Michigan scored four 
runs in the first inning, tacking on 
two in the third and one more in 
the eighth for insurance. 

This was the win that showed 

a flash of what this team could 
become, what they would become: 
a national contender. In the face 
and on the home turf of arguably 
the 
toughest 
competition 
the 

Wolverines 
faced 
all 
season, 

Michigan dominated the game. 
They never trailed.

It wasn’t the last time the two 

teams met this season either. 

May 23 – Michigan 5, Illinois 4 
One strike away.
Team 153 was one strike away 

from an early end to its season, 
one strike away from not making 
a postseason appearance at all, one 
strike away from this magical run. 

Luckily, sophomore designated 

hitter Jordan Nwogu had other 
ideas.

Michigan was down, 4-3, to 

Illinois in the bottom of the ninth 
inning. A loss to Ohio State the 
day before meant that falling to 
the Fighting Illini would send the 
Wolverines home for good.

Nwogu stepped up to the plate 

with two on and two out. With 
Michigan’s season on the line, he 
launched a two-run double to left 
center, and the Wolverines walked 
off with a 5-4 victory.

It was exactly the catalyst 

they needed. Since that win, the 
Wolverines have been hot. But 
it’s more than that. That was the 
win that introduced them to what 
Vanderbilt head coach Tim Corbin 
called their “playing personality”: 
free and loose, having fun, and 
playing to win – not just playing not 
to lose.

“We saw the end of our season 

right in front of us,” said senior first 
baseman Jimmy Kerr during the 
College World Series. “That kind 
of made the whole team appreciate 
every single game that we’ve had 
together since then. And that’s kind 
of the bigger picture. It’s not that 
we’re playing in a Regional, Super 
Regional, College World Series 
championship; it’s just that we get 
another game with each other.”

June 9 – Michigan 4, No. 1 

UCLA 2 

UCLA’s lineup was the best in 

the country. No one had been able 
to stop them all season. Michigan 
had as good as lost the game 
already.

Instead, the Wolverines pulled 

out a 4-2 victory to head to the 
College World Series. 

Henry, sick with the flu and 

pneumonia, and still recovering 

from the biceps tendonitis that 
rendered 
him 
inconsistent 

throughout much of the second half 
of the season, pitched seven innings 
of two run-baseball — containing a 
Bruins batting order that seemed 
practically unstoppable.

Sound familiar?
The first time Michigan played 

UCLA, it was just a flash of the 
team they could be. Three months 
later, they had gone even further.

June 15 – Michigan 5, Texas 

Tech 3 

The first time Michigan and 

Texas Tech met, it was proof of 
how far the Wolverines still had to 
go to be an Omaha contender. They 
were swept and outscored 29-10 
over three games.

Three 
months 
later, 
the 

Wolverines 
were 
an 
entirely 

different team — their bats hot, 
their pitchers cool and their 
defense firing on all cylinders. 
The Red Raiders provided the 
perfect litmus test: had Michigan 
really learned from its mistakes, 
and could it really compete at the 
highest stage in collegiate baseball?

The answer to both questions 

was 
an 
emphatic 
yes. 
The 

Wolverines got off to a quick start 
as a sacrifice fly from junior right 
fielder Jordan Brewer scored 
Nwogu in the top of the first. 
They tacked on three more in the 
third as Kerr launched a two-RBI 
triple down the right field line and 
scored on a single from senior third 
baseman Blake Nelson. 

Texas Tech made it close, 

scoring two runs in the bottom of 
the third and adding another in the 
bottom of the sixth, but Michigan 
was unshaken. They added a run 
in the top of the seventh when 
sophomore center fielder Jesse 
Franklin scored on an error for 
insurance, then cruised to a 5-3 
victory on the backs of solid 
pitching from junior right-hander 
Karl Kauffmann (7 innings, 8 hits, 3 
runs) and sophomore right-hander 
Jeff Criswell (two solid innings of 
one-hit relief).

The Wolverines had made a 

statement: they were more than 
just a Cinderella team, and their 
run amounted to more than just 
luck.

Michigan, at long last, was a 

national contender again.

Hutchins reacts to season cut short

In the middle of Thursday’s 

practice, 
Carol 
Hutchins’s 

phone rang. 

It was Michigan Athletic 

Director Warde Manuel. 

Right away, Hutchins knew 

the phone call wouldn’t be an 
easy one. 

She was cognizant of the 

other 
mandates 
that 
had 

trickled in across the collegiate 
landscape throughout the day 
— the PAC-12 and ACC had both 
cancelled all sporting events 
until further notice. So when 
Manuel called, Hutchins knew 
what was coming. 

Manuel’s words, a message 

relayed from NCAA President 
Mark Emmert, only confirmed 
what had grown to be the 
inevitable. Due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, all remaining 
NCAA 
winter 
and 
spring 

championships were cancelled 
— softball included. 

Her players, in an act of 

blissful ignorance, continued 
practice as Hutchins digested 
the news. It was her job to break 
it to them. The news that this 
would be their last gathering, 
that their season was over 23 
games in and at least 30 short. 

She stopped practice and 

pulled her team into their home 
dugout, symbolically a place of 
comfort and unity amidst the 
trying times. A dugout that 
Hutchins calls “her favorite 
place in the world,” a dugout 
those same players wouldn’t be 
able to convene in as one ever 
again.

It was an all-too fitting 

place to cling to whatever last 
semblance of normalcy was 
left. 

The team was ready for her. 

And so Hutchins embarked 
on what she described as the 
hardest thing she’s ever had to 
do as a coach.

“It’s just the worst day of 

every coach’s career right now, 
telling their student athletes 
that they’re done,” Hutchins 
told The Daily. “Probably the 
hardest day is the last day of 

the year and you close your last 
game. But all 36 of my last days 
have never compared to this.

“And it’s for every student 

athlete in the country. Every 
student athlete is affected, all 
the support people. Even my 
managers were crying. They’ve 
worked so hard. Everybody’s in 
this together. It’s really hard to 
put in perspective. Today’s a 
tragedy, in another day this will 
be a new normal.”

For the seniors, the news 

rung 
especially 
harrowing. 

Two days before Saturday, 
what was meant to be their 
final home opener, their days 
as collegiate athletes have been 
cut short. 

Outfielder 
Haley 

Hoogenraad, outfielder Thais 
Gonzalez, infielder Madison 
Uden and catcher Abby Skvarce 
are finished donning the maize 
and blue for Michigan softball. 

“I just hugged them and told 

them and that I was proud of 
them,” Hutchins said. “They 
were a great senior class. They 
came a long way from being 
freshmen and that’s ultimately 

how you judge people. I’m very 
proud of those four. They were 
doing a great job leading us, 
getting through our ups and 
downs. I was really proud of 
them and that’s all I can tell 
them. My heart breaks most for 
them.”

For the players, uncertainty 

lies ahead. Hutchins doesn’t 
know how much longer they 
will be on campus. No one 
knows much about anything 
in a situation so fluid and 
unparalleled. So, as Thursday’s 
practice 
culminated 
and 

the 
news 
reverberated 
in 

shockwaves, 
the 
team 
did 

all they could in such an 
overwhelming moment — rely 
on each other. 

“I know my team will be 

together,” Hutchins said. “I’m 
most concerned for those kids 
right now. What they need 
more than anything is to be 
with each other. We need to be 
together, that’s what we can do 
in times of grief.”

While 
the 
situation 
is 

unprecedented, Hutchins has 
no doubt her team will handle 
it with grace. 

“Our kids are well-equipped. 

They deal with adversity all 
the time. They deal with loss, 
they deal with failure. The 
most important thing they’ve 
learned is it’s not if you fall 
down, it’s if you get up. Our kids 
will get up.

“They’ll be strong.”

Beilein leaves ‘M’ for Cleveland with an unmistakable legacy

The last time the Michigan 
had to replace its head coach, the 
program was unrecognizable to 
those familiar with the current 
Wolverines.
Michigan in 2007 had barely 
scraped relevance since the breakup 
of the Fab Five in 1993. It hadn’t 
made the NCAA Tournament since 
1998 — an appearance later vacated 
by NCAA sanctions. It lived under 
the shadow of the football team and 
a group of recruits who had since 
been banned from the program.
CJ Lee, a Michigan guard from 
2006-09 and current director of 
program personnel, was there 
when then-coach Tommy Amaker 
was fired. Even with Amaker’s 
uninspiring record, his firing still 
incited some disappointment. After 
all, he had helped drag the program 
out of its sanction-induced low 
point in the early 2000s.
Lee, 
though, 
knew 
the 
Wolverines were getting someone 
good in John Beilein. Lee went 
to high school in western New 
York, 
where 
Beilein 
recruited 
some of his AAU teammates and 
had seen Beilein’s success at West 
Virginia. The Beilein he knew of 
back then was a coach who ran a 
unique offense and a 1-3-1 zone, a 
coach with a good reputation but 
questions about whether he could 
stick at a high-major program like 
Michigan.
Twelve years later, when Beilein 
left the Wolverines to take the 
helm of the Cleveland Cavaliers on 
Monday morning, he was a coach 
who still ran a unique offense, 
albeit one of a different vein, but 
had ditched the zone — and ditched 

control over his defense, hiring 
assistants with greater expertise 
in the area. He was a coach whose 
reputation had exploded, who 
hadn’t just succeeded at a high-
major program but taken it from 
no-man’s-land 
to 
consistent 
contender. He was a coach who had 
become, in some ways, impossible 
to replace — the unenviable task 
that now falls on the shoulders of 
athletic director Warde Manuel.
“The first couple years, people 
were 
kinda 
wondering, 
does 
(Beilein) have what it takes?” Lee 
told The Daily. “And it just shows 
that his ability to morph, his ability 
to adapt, his ability to change, his 
ability to figure out that place and 
figure out his way of doing things 
here — it was incredible. And it 
worked.”
Beilein got Michigan back to the 

NCAA Tournament in his second 
year, and the Wolverines have made 
it in eight of the past nine years — 
with five Sweet Sixteens and two 
appearances in the national title 
game. His performance surpassed 
even 
what 
could 
have 
been 
considered the best-case scenario.
“It goes without saying, he 
brought Michigan basketball back 
to prominence,” Lee said. “I would 
say he restored the image in the 
hearts and minds of a lot of people, 
probably in the court of public 
opinion. Certainly, coach Amaker 
did a great job in his time, coming 
out of the sanctions, and then coach 
Beilein took it to a level where you’re 
back in the Final Four.”
Zack Novak, a Michigan guard 
from 2008-12, joined the program 
in Beilein’s early days. Back then, 
the team was filled with Amaker 

holdovers, and Beilein was tasked 
with not only developing his 
young players, but getting buy-
in from his older ones — a test he 
passed with flying colors. Then, 
he began to build the foundation 
of the Wolverines’ new identity. 
Novak saw the beginning of that 
foundation, with Michigan’s NCAA 
Tournament appearance in 2009. 
By the time he left in 2012 — with 
a Big Ten regular-season title and a 
No. 4 seed in the tournament — he 
saw a program that finally stood on 
solid ground.
“From day one, when (Beilein 
started) recruiting me, the first 
step was, get back to the NCAA 
Tournament,” Novak told The Daily 
on April 13. “But he was very firm 
that Michigan should be a premier 
program and we needed to build the 
foundation to get back to where it 

should be. And so, I think from day 
one, he had a vision and he had his 
guys that bought into the vision.
“And I think you gotta give credit 
to a lot of the guys who came from 
coach Amaker, who rolled over. 
Kind of a difficult situation, right? 
Two very different styles of playing. 
And those guys easily could have 
been cancers on the team and not 
bought into the vision, and instead 
they did the opposite. And really 
set the foundation for what was to 
come. Now, with that being said, 
I’m not gonna lie to you and say that 
I thought we’d be in two national 
title games in the next 10 years. I 
think it’s gone a bit beyond what the 
original vision was.”
From 
there, 
Beilein 
built 
Michigan into what it is now, all with 
the perception that he runs a clean 
program. Beilein is one of the few 
high-major coaches who is widely 
believed not to cheat. He instilled 
his values in every player, from 
Lee and Novak until now. Former 
Michigan 
sports 
information 
director Bruce Madej remembered 
Beilein as someone who always 
talked about family and community. 
Even as Beilein began to crave the 
greater challenge that the NBA 
would bring, that community was 
what the Wolverines were to him.
In a way, the NBA is a culmination 
for Beilein. This is someone who has 
never held a permanent position as 
an assistant coach, instead climbing 
the ladder from high school JV 
to community college to Division 
II to mid-major to Michigan. 
Professional basketball was the one 
step he had never taken.
“What has happened to John 
Beilein in his life and in his coaching 
career has been miraculous, it’s 
really been magical,” said Jeff 
Neubauer, the current Fordham 
coach and a former Beilein assistant 

at Richmond and West Virginia 
from 1996-2005. “... Who he has 
been throughout his life is to take on 
a massive challenge — most of them 
were places where people didn’t 
think he could succeed. So he’s gone 
to different schools throughout his 
career and done amazing things 
over and over. So my speculation 
would be that this is his opportunity 
to take on another huge challenge, 
climb another mountain.”
Now, Beilein is firmly entrenched 
as a Michigan legend. No matter 
who you talk to, former players, 
assistants and people around the 
program have nary a bad word to 
say about him — as a person or a 
coach.
And regardless of what the 
future holds, Beilein will always 
be remembered as the coach who 
brought Michigan back to soaring 
heights, the coach who firmly 
implanted a new culture and the 
coach who did things the right way 
— in every sense of the word.
“I tell people all the time when 
they ask me about playing for, 
working for coach Beilein, is that as 
good of a basketball coach as he is, 
he’s a better person,” Lee said. “And 
I think that, over the last 12 years, 
the fan base and college basketball 
in general has got to witness an 
incredible, incredible human being 
who happens to be a basketball 
coach on the sidelines, in Ann Arbor.
“And I really hope that they 
cherish that. I hope they recognize 
how special that is to have the 
human being, the coach, the man, 
the success. How rare that is, for 
it all to come together like that. 
So I just hope that people are 
appreciative and he is honored 
for his time, because he did a 
tremendous job.”

Manuel’s gamble is the right one to make

ETHAN SEARS
2019 Managing Sports Editor

Warde 
Manuel spoke 
directly, with 
certainty and 
confidence.
“We looked 
at 
many,” 
Manuel said. 
“Broad scope. 
I stand here 
today 
with 
my choice.”
Before 
Juwan Howard had stepped 
to the podium as Michigan’s 
new 
basketball 
coach 
and 
before a question had been 
asked, Manuel answered the 
day’s biggest one. Since John 
Beilein left, a coaching search 
unfolded and 
ended 
last 
week 
with 
Howard, there 
has 
been 
a 
not-so 
subtle 
implication of 
nepotism that 
has come with 
the discussion 
of Howard.
Howard has 
the 
requisite 
qualifications, 
it starts, but would he be in 
this position if not for his 
association with the Fab Five? 
Manuel, who has never had 
a hiring of this magnitude 
in 
his 
hands 
completely, 
must be under pressure from 
donors. From regents. From 
Jalen Rose and Chris Webber; 
LeBron James and Dwyane 
Wade.
The 
athletic 
director 
acknowledged 
as 
much 
seconds later, noting Howard’s 
resonance with the university, 
its fans and its donors. 
But, outside pressures being 
as they may, this decision was 
Manuel’s to make. His choice. 
His gamble.
“There’s a whole lot of 
bunch of adjectives like that, 
that have already been used, 
and 
that’s 
fine,” 
Manuel 
said. “If I’m gonna take a 
risk for somebody, they’ll see 
why I took the risk and the 
gamble — and all the things 
you all say about what could 
possibly happen — with Juwan 
Howard.”
To be clear, it is a gamble 
and it does run a risk of 
failure. So would any other. 
That is beside the point. 

Beilein left the Wolverines 
with little warning in mid-
May — when the coaching 
carousel 
had 
already 
slowed. The candidate pool, 
inherently, was thinner than 
it might have 
been a month 
or two earlier. 
And, 
even 
if 
Manuel 
had 
his pick of the 
lot, it would be 
impossible 
to 
hire 
another 
Beilein.
The 
best 
coach 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
program 
doesn’t come around often. 
Particularly not when that 
coach is Beilein, who ran things 
in a way unique throughout 
college basketball.
Howard 
hasn’t 
been 
in 
college basketball. He isn’t 
familiar with a world where 
a slip of the tongue can be 
a recruiting violation, and 
admitted as much on Thursday. 
Even without his ties to the 
Fab Five, the likelihood that 
he 
recruits 
programs 
like 
Mac Irvin Fire, the way his 
name alone makes heads turn 
— that makes him inherently 
antithetical to Beilein. 
And that is fine. 
Juwan Howard isn’t here 
to build on John Beilein’s 
legacy. He’s here to make his 
own. There are no shortage of 
basketball reasons to think he 
can.
Howard 
comes 
with 
endorsements from Pat Riley 
and Erik Spoelstra, two names 
that should carry more weight 
than his former teammates. 
He succeeded as an assistant 
in Miami, unequivocally so. 
The Heat won titles when they 
had the requisite talent, and 
outperformed 
expectation 

anyway 
when 
they 
didn’t. 
Howard 
was 
a 
repeated 
candidate for NBA job openings 
for a reason — he’s developed 
a well-earned reputation as 
a good basketball mind, and 
someone who connects with 
players.
There’s also the intangible 
— which was on full display 
Thursday 
when 
Howard 
stepped to the podium and 
wiped tears from his eyes, 
needing to gather himself 
before he started speaking.
Yes, it’s concerning that 
it may take some time for 
Howard to get a grasp on the 
NCAA’s rulebook. And yes, it 
should raise eyebrows that he 
answered a question about his 
basketball philosophy with, 
“Well, it remains to be seen, 
fellas, right?”
The rest of his answer, 
though, speaks to the qualities 
that got him hired.
“But I can tell you this,” 
Howard 
said. 
“One 
thing 
about me, I’m humble. And 
I don’t have all the answers. 
We’re gonna try to figure out 
solutions together. … Players 
have to be active participants 
in finding solutions. We will 
create this identity together. 
And we will have fun doing it, 
too.”
All that — the emotion 
and 
the 
attitude, 
the 
acknowledgements 
that 
he 
isn’t 
perfect 
and 
the 
willingness to work on it 
— makes it believable that 
Howard will put in the hours 
to fill the gaps. This is no 
reunion tour or nostalgia trip, 
nice as those side benefits may 
be. Howard was hired because 
Warde Manuel thinks he can 
win basketball games, first 
and foremost.
But don’t get it wrong. This 
is Manuel’s gamble. The right 
gamble.

Wolverines’ playoff hopes die in Ohio

COLUMBUS — The No. 4 
Michigan football team was just 
hanging on.
Even when the Wolverines 
went down two touchdowns in 
the first half, and even when 
momentum favored Ohio State 
to begin the second half, they 
hung perilously within reaching 
distance.
But with just under five 
minutes left in the third quarter, 
the floodgates broke open.
It came on a punt, just after 
Michigan had gone down, 27-19, 
on a Buckeye field goal. Ohio State 
receiver Chris Olave took a free 
run at junior punter Will Hart 
and blocked Hart’s kick.
The ball deflected high into 
the air and directly into the 
outstretched arms of Buckeye 
cornerback Sevyn Banks, who 
took it untouched to the house.
The Wolverines had finally 
wilted, like they have against 
Ohio State in 14 of the teams’ last 
15 matchups, and from there they 
could do nothing right, losing, 
62-39.
“It was tough,” said senior 
safety Tyree Kinnel. “We try to 
stay upbeat throughout the whole 
game and trust each other and 
stay in the fight. But I remember a 
point where it just got out of hand. 
Slowly devastated us throughout 
the game. All the yards they were 
putting up, how easily they were 
scoring, it was tough. Extremely 
tough.”
The out-of-hand point may 
have been the punt, or really any 
point after that, but the sings of 

impending trouble were present 
from the beginning.
Michigan started the game 
with the ball and a three-and-out, 
and the Buckeyes promptly drove 
43 yards for a score immediately 
afterward, finishing it off with a 
touchdown to Olave.
Olave, who entered the game 
with four catches all season, 
tacked on another score with 
9:08 left in the second quarter, 
and Ohio State threatened to 
break the game open when wide 
receiver 
Johnnie 
Dixon 
III 
caught a wide-open touchdown 
to extend the Buckeye lead to 21-6 
minutes later.
To these opening blows, the 
Wolverines had answers.
They scored back with a 
fade-route 
touchdown 
from 
sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins. Then, on the ensuing 
kickoff, Ohio State kick returner 
Demario McCall simply dropped 
the ball and Michigan recovered 
on 
the 
Buckeyes’ 
nine-yard 
line. Junior running back Chris 
Evans caught a wheel route for a 
touchdown on the next snap, and 
despite failing to convert on the 
two-point conversion attempt, 
the Wolverines were suddenly 
down just two.
Ohio State drove down to 
Michigan’s two-yard line twice 
in 
its 
next 
three 
offensive 
possessions, but had to settle for 
field goals both times.
“We had our opportunities 
offensively, and you know, the 
defense started the second half 
good and held them to a field 
goal and got a stop, and we had a 
chance,” Patterson said.

That’s 
when 
Olave 
broke 
through the Wolverines’ punt 
protection, 
and 
Banks 
went 
dancing into the endzone.
Junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson threw an interception 
three plays later, and the Buckeyes 
scored two snaps after that. 
As Kinnel put it, things were 
out of hand.
“You know, sometimes you 
get desperate in those types of 
situations,” Patterson said of 
his interception. “Wasn’t really 
trying to force it, I was actually 
trying to throw the ball out of 
bounds. Whoever made that play 
made a good play and hit my 
elbow.”
One last time, Michigan drove 
down the field in an effort to 
battle back, and Collins secured 
another fade route to chop the 
deficit back to two scores.
And then Ohio State wide 
receiver Parris Campell Jr., took 
the first play on the Buckeyes’ 
next drive 78 yards to the 
endzone.
In the end, the statistics are 
hideous 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
They gave up the most points of 
any regulation game in program 
history. Ever. They allowed the 
most yards (567) since coach 
Jim Harbaugh and defensive 
coordinator Don Brown have 
taken over. They gave it all up in 
their biggest game of the year.
After Campbell’s run, the 
metaphorical 
floodgates were 
completely obliterated.
Ohio State spent the rest of 
the game scoring and breaking 
records 
offensively, 
while 
pumping up the crowd and 
dancing on graves defensively.
