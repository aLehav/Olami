Graduate student 
opens classroom for 
discussion on race, 
student activism

Nearly 40 students attended 

a teach-in at Mason Hall on 
Wednesday morning to discuss 
nationwide 
issues 
related 
to 

student activism in light of 

recent events at the University of 
Missouri and Yale University.

which was open to all students 
Wednesday, nearly doubled in 
attendance over the usual 18 
students. McCoy split the class 
time into two parts, giving a brief

Hundreds of 

students gather to 
share stories, call 
for campus reforms

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
candid 
conversation 

about race and diversity at the 
University of Missouri — largely 
led by students — spilled onto 
the University of Michigan’s 

campus Wednesday as hundreds 
of 
demonstrators 
gathered 

on the Diag in solidarity with 
Missouri’s Black community. 

“Voices are being silenced not 

only in Missouri, but right here 
at the University of Michigan,” 
said Social Work student Wendy 
Cortes, 
one 
of 
the 
event’s 

organizers. “And it is our goal 
for you to know that you are able 
to exist without second thought, 
without hesitation and without 
genuine fear.”

Hosted by School of Social 

Work People Of Color Collective, 

the demonstration began at 
the School of Social Work 
Building, 
where 
participants 

created signs and banners using 
#Umich4Mizzou. From there, 
chanting “UMich for Mizzou, 
we support you,” demonstrators 
marched to the Diag, where some 
shared 
personal 
experiences 

about 
being 
Black 
at 
the 

University.

Following a string of racial 

incidents 
targeting 
Black 

students and other students 
of color at the University of 
Missouri, 
Missouri 
students 

held 
demonstrations 
around 

their campus, demanding the 
Missouri 
system’s 
president, 

Timothy Wolfe, resign from 
his position. Wolfe as well as 
R. Bowen Loftin, the school’s 
chancellor, announced Tuesday 
they would resign from their 
positions.

And 
for 
some 
Missouri 

students, the call for change 
resulted in drastic measures.

Panel considers 

available resources, 

recruitment for 

veterans on campus

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

In honor of Veterans Day on 

Wednesday, 
student 
veterans 

joined a group of 50 students and 
community members to highlight 
their transitions from combat to 
classroom.

Held at the Michigan Union, 

the forum was one of many 
hosted 
by 
the 
University’s 

Veteran and Military Services 
this week. Other events included 
panel discussions on the wars in 
Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan and 
Iraq and the Cold War.

Engineering junior Kenneth 

Greene, who served from 2008 
until 2013 at the Marine Corps 

Airspace in New River, N.C., said 
he was pleasantly surprised by 
how generously the University 
community treats its veteran 
students.

“There’s so many resources for 

veterans on campus it’s insane,” 
Greene said. “I don’t think we’ve 
been left out at all, as far as that 
goes.”

These 
resources 
include 

scholarships offered specifically 
to veterans, as well as the 
University’s policy of extending 
in-state tuition to all veterans 
regardless of their residency.

LSA 
junior 
Joshua 
Strup 

served in the U.S. Army from 
2001 to 2010 and was stationed 
in 
Germany, 
Oklahoma 
and 

Michigan. Though Strup said 
the 
University 
community’s 

recognition of veterans is great, 
he added that the University 
could improve the way it targets 
veterans 
in 
the 
recruitment 

process. He said while veterans

Indian holiday 
marked with 

food, traditional 

festivities

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

For 
those 
who 
celebrate 

Diwali, the festival marks a time 
when the darkness of the world 

was vanquished by the return of 
the prince and deity Lord Rama.

“That’s why it’s generally 

known 
as 
the 
festival 
of 

lights,” said Nita Shah, an 
administrative assistant with 
the Global Scholars Program.

More 
than 
100 
students 

gathered 
in 
North 
Quad 

Residence Hall on Wednesday 
to celebrate the holiday, an 
Indian festival celebrated by 
people of the Hindu, Sikh and 
Jain religions.

The Michigan Sahana and 

Maya Dance Team performed 
at an event LSA senior Sindhu 
Kadhiresan called a sort of 
equivalent to Christmas. She 
said there was a shortage of 
Diwali celebrations on campus 
this year, which she said was 
may have been due to the busy 
time of year the festival fell on.

“It’s important for us to show 

people on campus how it holds 
the same value,” Kadhiresan

Medical Students 
launch program 
to guide patients 
through signup

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Many previously uninsured 

Americans gained coverage 
following the implementation 
of the Affordable Care Act in 
2010. However, many people 
still remain uninsured and 
University 
Medical 
School 

students wanted to learn why.

Brent Williams, an associate 

professor of internal medicine, 
and a team of medical students 
run a free clinic in Pinckney, 
Mich. Williams said they 
continue to encounter a large 
number of uninsured patients 
every week. In a recent paper, 

After ACA, 
many still 
lack health

make up 13 percent of the U.S. 
population, they only make up 
1.5 percent of the University’s 
student population.

“We 
are 
a 
very 

underrepresented 
demographic,” 
Strup 
said. 

“What the University might 
want to consider is trying 
to 
recruit 
more 
military 

personnel to pursue a life here 
at Michigan after they get out.”

Robert Kraynak is a first-

year graduate student pursuing 
both an MBA from the School 
of Business and an M.S. in the 
School of Natural Resources. 
Kraynak served in the Navy 
from 2007 to 2015. He was 
deployed to Afghanistan twice.

Kraynak said he had a 

positive 
experience 
with 

Veterans Affairs in the Ann 
Arbor area.

“The VA in Ann Arbor is 

fantastic,” Krayter said. “I’ve 
been very impressed.”

The panelists stressed that 

misconceptions 
regarding 

veterans 
are 
harmful 
and 

inaccurate. Strup said one of 
the most damaging notion 

ascribed to veterans is that 
they are warmongers, and 
having that reputation — which 
he said is skewed from the 
reality — is detrimental to both 
the troops and their cause.

“The majority of the veterans 

I know abhor war,” Strup said. 
“We hate violence. We just 
understand that sometimes it’s 
a unfortunate unnecessary evil 
in the world.”

Strup said more often than 

not 
veterans 
are 
pacifists, 

particularly after returning 
from war.

“I think there are a lot of 

false stereotypes about the 
military,” Strup said.

Greene 
echoed 
Strup’s 

points, 
also 
noting 
that 

veterans tend to be more laid 
back than their traditional 
characterization.

“Civilians think that we’re 

all crazy hard-asses,” Greene 
said. “ I think most of us are 
pretty open and generally laid 
back. You never want to label 
someone an angry person.”

Social Work student Monica 

Flores served in San Diego as 
an air traffic controller from 
2001 to 2010. As a woman, 
Flores 
said 
she 
is 
rarely 

recognized as being a veteran, 

and said she is often asked if 
she was inquiring for services 
for a brother or father.

Kraynak 
said 
the 

oversexualization of war in 
the media acts as a machine 
for 
these 
misconceptions, 

citing the 2008 film “The Hurt 
Locker,” a drama based on the 
Iraq war. He added that the 
unglamorous areas of military 
service, which account for a 
majority of deployed service 
are underrepresented in the 
media.

“ ‘The Hurt Locker’ is 

supposed to be a representation 
of my community,” Kraynak 
said. “They really gloss over all 
the times you’re sitting around 
playing euchre.”

Kraynak 
said 
though 

negative 
stereotypes 

are 
common, 
excessive 

glorification of veterans is 
another form of misconception.

“There are so many different 

ways to serve — not just your 
country but the people around 
you,” Kraynak said. “Don’t put 
us on a pedestal, there’s no 
need to. We volunteered for 
something, we served, did great 
things — maybe sometimes we 
didn’t do great things — we’re 
human.”

College presidents host panel 
on diversity in higher education

As part of weeklong 
symposium, leaders 
consider issues of 
access, inclusion

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

The Office of Diversity, Equity 

and Inclusion hosted a panel on 
the future of diversity in higher 
education Wednesday as a part of 
the University’s week-long cam-
pus Diversity Summit.

More than 150 people attended 

the event in Rackham Ampithe-
atre, which was sponsored by the 
National Center for Institutional 
Diversity. During the event, 10 
officials from a variety of colleges 
and universities around the coun-
try discussed the state of minority 
relations on campuses. John Bur-
khardt, NCID director and School 
of Education professor, intro-
duced the panel by emphasizing 
the importance of the discussion.

“Institutions like Michigan get 

a lot of attention for the stances 
they take on these issues,” Burck-
hardt said. “Our purpose today 
is to give a forceful message that 
higher education is fiercely com-
mitted to these ideals. How can 
we work together … to advance 
diversity?”

Earl Lewis, former dean of 

Rackham Graduate School, mod-
erated the discussion. His open-
ing question, which asked the 
panelists to define diversity at 
their schools, took up the bulk of 
the session. Panel members rep-
resented an array of institutions, 
including tribal, religious, histori-
cally Black and predominantly 
Hispanic colleges.

Panelists opened by explain-

ing the importance of diversity 
in higher education institutions. 
Steven Simpson, the president 
of Baker College, asserted that 
a variety of students facilitates 
intellectual growth, particularly 
when non-minority students are 
not otherwise exposed to other 
experiences.

“We need to help students 

understand how to work with one 
another and how to understand 
each other,” Simpson said. “I 
think we get bogged down think-
ing about career so much. How 
do we bring diversity to an area 
that’s not very diverse? How do 
we instill in our students a global 
perspective?”

Much of the discussion focused 

on how the current state of diver-
sity efforts on college campuses — 
which often focuses on recruiting 
— is problematic.

“I think terms like equity and 

diversity … can often become a 
euphemisms for assimilation,” 
said Nancy Barcelo, president of 
Northern New Mexico College. 
“Enrollment is important, but we 
need to make structural changes 
so that we don’t come back in 
another 40 years to have the same 
conversation.”

The speakers were often critical 

of the University’s diversity policies, 
in particular. As most of the panel-
ists visited from smaller schools, 
several went on the offensive 
against large research institutions. 
James Anderson, the chancellor of 
Fayetteville State University, ques-
tioned the long-term efficacy of 
the University’s diversity for non-
minority students.

“Where is the University of 

Michigan’s white paper that 
shows all the resources invested 
in diversity in the last five to 10 
years?” Anderson asked. “Are you 
producing white students who 
can go out and participate in the 
conversation? People think diver-
sity is to aid diverse students, but 
really, it’s about changing the 
majority culture.”

Christine 
Wiseman, 
presi-

dent of St. Xavier University, also 
spoke to the advantage of smaller 
colleges in implementing diver-
sity reform. 

“The large institutions get all 

the research dollars to tell us how 
to do what we’re already doing,” 
Wiseman said. “Our kinds of 
institutions have the possibility 
to be on the cutting edge.”

the students expanded on the 
reasons that might be.

“With the Affordable Care 

Act and the Healthy Michigan 
Plan, the number of uninsured 
patients in Michigan dropped 
significantly, but they found that 
they were still left with a steady 
flow of patients into the clinic for 
the uninsured,” Williams said. 
“They had a suspicion that there 
were reasons why some of those 
patients could be insured but 
were not and thought it was just 
time to ask them.”

Williams helped the Medical 

School 
students 
with 
their 

research. He said the students 
found many of their patients were 
unaware of how exactly the ACA 
could make health insurance an 
affordable option for them.

“Some patients weren’t aware 

of how the tax credits worked,” 
he said. “You can sign up if your 
income is above a certain level 
and still be eligible for tax credits 
and those come back at tax 
time. But calculating the actual 
effect on your annual budget is 
difficult.”

Based 
on 
this 
finding, 

Williams said students realized 
there are opportunities to help 
patients by providing guidance 
for calculating the impact of the 
ACA on their budgets.

Second-year Medical School 

student Brian Desmond is one 
of the students who works in 
the clinic and conducted the 
research. He said another reason 
people are not insured is that 
they don’t always know how to 
sign up for the insurance they 
qualify for.

“Most 
people 
know 
the 

Affordable Care Act happened 
and 
changed 
insurance 

coverage,” Desmond said. “Not 
as many people seem to know the 
details of how that affects them 
individually.”

As a result of these findings, 

the students thought it was 
necessary to provide insurance 
counseling as a feature of their 
free clinic. The government 
provides some of this training 
under the ACA. Desmond said a 
group of six students completed 
the 
training 
to 
provide 

counseling to patients.

“Essentially, our findings were 

strong enough that we thought 
our patients could benefit from 
one-on-one 
counseling 
about 

their insurance options,” he said.

Desmond said the students 

will mostly help patients with 
navigating 
theHealthCare.gov 

marketplace, as well as sign up 
for Medicaid.

Though the task of educating 

and providing all patients with 
insurance may seem easy for 
some people, Williams said, the 
prospect of a monthly payment 
and large deductibles can be 
daunting when coupled with an 
unstable income. Many patients, 
he said, have only intermittent 
work.

“So even though in a given 

year 
they 
might 
technically 

make enough to qualify for 
a 
tax 
subsidy, 
they’re 
less 

certain 
that 
the 
next 
year 

they’re going to make the same 
amount,” Williams said. “The 
unpredictability of it makes them 
hesitant to commit to something 
that has a monthly payment and 
a big copay.”

However, 
Williams 
said 

having 
insurance 
under 
the 

ACA could allow patients to save 
money in the long term. Under the 
ACA, insurance companies are 
required to cover preventative 
tests such as mammograms, 
which 
could 
prevent 
health 

issues down the road.

Williams listed three main 

problems that come from lack 
of insurance. The first is that 
if patients need to go to the 
emergency room, they have to pay 
the bill themselves. The second 
implication is that it’s harder to 
get care for chronic illnesses, 
including 
hypertension 
and 

diabetes, that, if untreated, can 
have more devastating impacts 
in the long run. The third issue is 
the lack of preventative care.

“We see patients all the 

time who just need the basic 
preventative 
care 
but 
can’t 

get it because they don’t have 
insurance,” he said.

Desmond agreed that health 

insurance is key for providing 
the best patient care and said 
though the free clinic will 
probably always be necessary, 
he hopes their research and 
current counseling services can 
help people achieve optimal 
insurance coverage.

“If you look at studies about 

health insurance, really it’s 
in people’s best interest to 
get health insurance and be a 
part of the formal healthcare 
network,” he said. “Our goal is 
to get as many people affordable 
health insurance so that they 
can see someone else and not 
rely on us.” 

between students during the 
latter portion.

“Many of us have watched 

and wondered at the situation 
in Missouri … and I was sure 
people would want to talk about 
this,” McCoy said. “The question 
is how can we replicate some of 
these events?”

McCoy 
noted 
that 
the 

resignations of the Missouri 
system’s 
president 
and 
the 

chancellor of the flagship campus 
were caused by deep-seated 
tension between students and the 
administration. Student protest, 
which came to a head after 
the university’s football team 
refused to play until the president 
stepped down, stemmed from 
what many saw as the school’s 
failure to address several racist 
incidents on campus.

“Consider 
institutional 

failure,” 
McCoy 
said. 

“Administrations are often either 
oblivious or flat-out resistant to 
what students are demanding.”

The lecture also sought to place 

current events in the context of 
local campaigns — particularly, 
last year’s U.S. Supreme Court 
decision to uphold Michigan’s 
affirmative action ban and the 
#BBUM 
movement, 
which 

organized on campus in 2013 to 
provide a voice to the experience 
on campus for Black students. 
The demands of Black student 
groups at the University, McCoy 
said, have remained largely the 
same since their founding in the 
civil rights movement.

“Both 
external 
forces 
… 

and local grievances sparked 
#BBUM,” McCoy said. “But there 
have been consistent demands, 
(like) 
increasing 
the 
Black 

enrollment to 10 percent of the 
student body.”

The 
following 
discussion 

on diversity and treatment of 
minority students was especially 
relevant 
following 
Tuesday’s 

campuswide diversity summit, 
a week-long effort to encourage 
campus diversity and inclusion 
hosted by Univesity President 
Mark Schlissel. Many chafed 
at the portrayal of diversity 

on campus, and commented 
specifically on the summit.

LSA 
sophomore 
Stephen 

Wallace 
expressed 

disappointment 
with 

administration’s 
response 
to 

student demands.

“Some people really think 

Michigan is diverse,” he said. 
“Like, ‘Two Black people in 
my class is so diverse.’ And 
numbers are important, but so is 
experience. It felt like Schlissel 
didn’t understand that.”

“The 
percentage 
of 
Black 

students on (recruiting) flyers 
is so much higher than the 
percentage 
actually 
at 
the 

University.” 
Engineering 

sophomore 
Raymond 
Smith-

Byrd added. “It makes me feel 
like I don’t want your flyers.” 

Students also discussed the 

relationship between free speech 
and racial sensitivity on campus.

LSA junior Vesal Stoakley 

commented 
on 
the 
recent 

controversy at Yale University 
regarding 
free 
speech 
and 

culturally considerate costumes. 
In advance of Halloween, the 
university 
released 
guidance 

encouraging students to avoid 
wearing 
“culturally 
unaware 

or 
insensitive 
costumes.” 
A 

response letter from a Yale 
faculty member saying students 
should be able to wear whatever 
they want later sparked outrage 
from many students.

“We have to keep a campus 

climate 
that 
is 
welcoming,” 

Stoakley said. “But there has to 
be a balance, where we’re not 
infringing on free speech, but 
we’re also considering the other 
side.”

LSA 
freshman 
Schaefer 

Thelen said creating safe spaces 
on campus takes precedence over 
potentially offensive free speech.

“Arguing for free speech for 

the sake of offending others 
doesn’t 
make 
much 
sense,” 

Thelen said.

McCoy concluded the teach-

in by emphasizing that dialogue 
is the first step to any effective 
change on campus.

“I 
think 
if 
students 
pay 

attention to Missouri and the 
shortcomings at this University, I 
think something will come out of 
it,” he said. “It has to.”

the 
president’s 
resignation. 

Members 
of 
the 
Missouri 

football team said they would not 
engage in any football-related 
activities until the president 
stepped down.

On the Diag on Wednesday 

evening, organizers read various 
posts on social media that 
followed Wolfe and Loftin’s 
announcement, 
including 

one from a Yik Yak user who 
posted they would shoot any 
Black students on the Missouri 
campus. There were also reports 
of unlicensed vehicles circling 
Black students in parking lots at 
Mizzou.

Cortes said she was outraged 

at the University of Missouri’s 
lack of response to threats 
toward Black students on the 
campus.

“Black 
students 
at 
the 

University of Missouri have 
continuously 
experienced 

racism 
and 
discrimination 

on campus, as many other 
institutions of higher education 
have, ” she said. “As stated by a 
Missouri student, the University 
of Missouri administration has 
continued to overshadow the 
racism and violence toward 
students of color with well 
written 
PR 
statements 
and 

movements and initiatives that 
never tackle the issue.”

She added that she was 

disappointed 
that 
professors 

at the University’s School of 
Social Work weren’t providing 
a 
platform 
for 
students 
to 

discuss issues brought to light by 
demonstrations in Missouri. The 
University is currently in the 
midst of aweek-long diversity 
summit 
intended 
to 
garner 

input from the community as 
administrators craft a campus-
wide strategic plan to improve 
equity and inclusion on campus. 

Social Work student Khalid 

Bowens echoed Cortes’ remarks, 
saying he has noticed a lack of 
response from some University 

faculty members.

“I’m tired of teachers sitting 

in my classrooms telling me that 
things that are going on within 
Black America does not matter 
in this classroom because yes the 
fuck it does.” he said. “Because 
I’m in this classroom, this is my 
life and this is what I have to go 
through.”

Engineering and LSA senior 

Will Royster, a Central Student 
Government 
presidential 

candidate for the 2015-2016 
academic year, said both the 
Black 
Student 
Union 
and 

members of By Any Means 
Necessary 
have 
coordinated 

similar efforts in past years, but 
demonstrations at the University 
of Missouri show more effective 
ways to get University officials 
to respond to concerns raised by 
Black students.

In Missouri, the threat of 

football players striking could 
have impacted revenue from 
cancelled games. If the team 
missed its Saturday game against 
Brigham 
Young 
University, 

Missouri would have lost $1 
million due to an agreement 
signed by both schools last year.

“With this Missouri incident, 

we 
saw 
the 
solution,” 
he 

said. “We talk Black politics, 
but everybody talks money; 
everybody talks green dollars.”

He also said that Blacks 

students should build coalitions 
with other multiethnic students.

“Multiethnic people, y’all go 

through some of the same shit 
we go through,” he said. “We 
need to build coalitions. We need 
to support each other. This shit 
is intersectional all day.”

Several other demonstrators 

offered 
remarks 
during 
the 

event, 
drawing 
on 
personal 

experiences 
of 
racism 
and 

navigating 
a 
predominately 

white campus as a student of 
color. One student quoted Martin 
Luther King Jr., and called 
on those in the community to 
remain active in times of moral 
crisis.

Another 
attendee 
on 
the 

Diag said users replied to a 

video of the demonstration she 
posted on Twitter comparing 
demonstrators to “chimpanzee’s 
mating” and something they 
“saw on Discovery Channel.”

“This is what people look at 

us today as: animals,” she said. 
“They don’t see the injustice in 
this world, they don’t open their 
eyes to see what’s really going 
on.”

LSA freshman Jason Young 

said in his remarks that he felt 
devalued and unappreciated at 
the University.

“My presence is not desired 

here,” he said. “But what does 
this ‘M’ mean? If this a symbol 
of hatred and it’s saying that I’m 
not welcome here, what does 
it mean? It hurts me to think 
that I came to this college to be 
accepted and to just learn and 
instead, I’m seen as this oddity.”

Bowens 
echoed 
Young’s 

remarks, and said he’s tired of 
being treated as the token Black 
student in his classes.

“I’m tired of sitting in a 

classroom with Black students 
who look at me like I’m supposed 
to educate them,” he said. “Don’t 
look at me as your token Black 
student to tell you about the 
Black experience because we all 
have Black experiences. Look at 
all these Black faces here tonight 
and I can tell you we all live 
different lives.”

Some 
students 
connected 

events at the University of 
Missouri to the 2014 killings of 
unarmed Black men in Ferguson, 
Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y. In 
his remarks, LSA sophomore 
Theo Nobles, recounted his 
experience his freshman year 
and feelings of shock when these 
events broke.

“I was in my dorm room at 

Mary Markley Hall with my 
roommate, and we just sat 
and looked at each other and 
thought, this is the world we live 
in,” he said. “A man can get killed 
in cold blood and his murderer 
can just walk away.”

Nobles said being a Black 

man at a predominantly white 
institution has caused him to 

be looked down upon by peers. 
It was understood, Nobles said, 
that as a Black man, he would be 
treated differently.

“From the get-go, you are 

looked at as beneath,” he said. 
“From the get-go, you are looked 
at as a future criminal, a future 
statistic. I get asked why I 
decided to go to a predominantly 
white 
institution, 
not 
a 

historically Black college, every 
day. I’m sure people at Missouri 
that look like me get asked the 
same thing.”

Upon request for interview, 

some 
white 
demonstrators 

declined to comment for the 
purpose of elevating the Black 
perspective on the issue. White 
demonstrators 
also 
allowed 

Black community members to 
stand at the front the group 
during the march to the Diag.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily after the event, 
LSA junior Julia Wang, who 
attended the demonstration, said 
she believes giving minorities a 
platform to express themselves 
is an integral part of the process 
toward change.

“It’s a really important event 

to come to as someone who falls 
into the minority category but 
may not always feel the effects of 
it as an Asian woman,” she said. 
“I think really important that 
that platform is available and we 
let those people speak and hear 
the other side.”

She also said she was shocked 

that issues affecting the Black 
community on campus are often 
not discussed.

“Every time I come, hearing 

people’s voices and hearing their 
stories about how they’re treated 
makes me shocked,” she said. “It 
makes me feel very lucky, but in 
the worst way possible. No one 
deserves to feel that way, no one 
deserves to be treated that way, 
and it’s horrifying that this is the 
only way I hear about it.”

said. “The University doesn’t 
really encourage giving us time 
off to celebrate it, so people are 
busy or it gets overshadowed, 
amongst other things.”

The holiday is often celebrated 

by lighting lamps around the 
house and receiving blessings 
from elders. Like many holidays, 
food is also a key part of the 
celebration.

Shah said hosting a celebration 

like Diwali at the University is an 
important way of reflecting the 
campus’ diverse community.

“It is often found that we are 

not well represented in many 
ways, and in order to show 
how are lives are more similar 
than different it’s important 
that we share our celebrations 
with a community that may not 
necessarily know what Diwali 
is all about,” she said. “It’s 
important to allay any fears 
or misrepresentations of the 
festival as well.”

Kadhiresan said this is the 

first Diwali she is spending 
without connecting with her 
family in some way.

“I was actually talking to 

my mom this morning and she 
was really missing us,” she said. 
“It’s the first year we’re not 
completely together. I really 
wish I could be with my family 

at this time because it’s the same 
thing as other people being with 
their families for Christmas or 
for Ramadan. It would be nice to 
be able to go home and see them.”

While 
she 
understands 

that 
the 
University 
cannot 

accommodate 
every 
religious 

holiday with time off, Kadhiresan 
said 
the 
University 
should 

acknowledge the large Indian 
Hindu population on campus.

“It’s 
actually 
kind 
of 

disappointing,” she said. “But I 
think it’s kind of the tradition in 
American school systems to not 
really give days off for Diwali. 
It would probably be possible to 
coordinate one long weekend off 
for Diwali.”

LSA freshman Ayla Ahmed 

and Engineering freshman Arthi 
Nadhan said while they enjoyed 
the event at North Quad, they did 
not feel it accurately represented 
the festival.

“I thought there could have 

been more light, personally,” 
Ahmed said.

Nadhan, who had performed 

at the event as a part of Michigan 
Sahana, said she also was looking 
forward to seeing more lights 
at the event, since Diwali is 
considered the festival of lights.

“I actually knew a lot about 

the holiday, since I celebrate it at 
home,” Nadhan said. “But it was 
nice seeing that people came and 
celebrated it here.”

Me and Ali

A 

few years ago, my older sister 
spoke words to me that I will 
never forget. In the middle of 

a 
conversation 

about diet (which, 
as two physically 
active 
health 

enthusiasts, 
we 

have often), she 
remarked, “Oh, I 
definitely was this 
close” making a 
pinching motion 
with her fingers, 
“to having an eat-
ing disorder.”

She said this 

casually, 
as 

mundane as if she was telling me 
about the weather. I barely reacted; 
the comment registered in the back 
of my mind, but it was probably 
more out of annoyance than any 
real recognition of the problem 
with the words she had just spoken.

Let me stop to clarify that my 

sister never formally had an eating 
disorder. For years, while I was still 
an active gymnast, I was annoyed 
at her dietary habits. In my naïve, 
20-hours-of-practice-per-week, 
racing-metabolism 
mindset, 
I 

couldn’t begin to understand why, 
for example, on her birthday she 
would deny a perfectly delicious 
piece of chocolate cake. If we 
were on vacation in Maine for the 
summer she wouldn’t eat a single 
lobster roll, her favorite food, 
because “she couldn’t afford it.” 
Of course, it was my responsibility 
as the annoying younger sister to 
mock her by eating two of them and 
have ice cream for dessert.

It wasn’t until my senior year 

of high school, when I had to quit 
gymnastics 
after 
repeat 
ankle 

injuries, that I thought critically 
about food for the first time. I 
became 
self-conscious, 
over-

analytical and overly strict on what 
I ate. I still ate enough — for me, 
that has never been a problem — but 
I would be lying if I didn’t admit 
that the struggle was always there. 
I was where my sister had been, 
struggling to adjust to a drastically 
changed lifestyle that, food-wise, 
essentially came down to “calories 
in, calories out” reasoning.

However, my sister and I are lucky. 

She found and then introduced 
me to a gym with a community of 
people I now count as some of my 
closest friends. Not only did the 
coaches and members of the gym 
provide physical activity, but also 
they provided an image of “healthy” 
that I now aspire to. Never, for as 
long as I have been a part of this 
community, has the emphasis been 
on appearance. Together, we have 
performance-based goals, which 
include both nutrition and activity.

Though it took some adjustment, 

I can say today that my definition 
of beauty has changed from the 
physical shape of an individual’s 
body or the number on a scale to the 
capacity of that person to move and 
function. People tell me, “You’re 
not the ‘typical’ kind of skinny,” 
and I respond with, “I don’t want 
or need to be.” I also know people 
who appear thinner than me, but 
who lift twice as much weight, and 
that, to me, is also beautiful. At the 
risk of being cliché, I’ll go as far as 
saying that definitions of beauty and 
strength are not one-size-fits-all.

Though the comment my sister 

made that day was in passing, I expect 
her words are true for a lot, if not the 
majority, of women today. If things had 
not gone the way they had for my sister 
and me, if our gym community had 
not guided me toward a new direction 
of health, I may have become one of 
the 30 million people in the United 
States currently suffering from an 
 

eating disorder.

Inside of the gym there may be 

one, communal understanding of 
beauty and strength, but outside is a 
different world completely. I could 
drone on about the “Barbie culture” 
that’s portrayed in the media; how 
by praising the “thigh gap” and the 
“spring-break bod” society imposes an 
expectation on young women that is, 
simply put, a fantasy.

I’m no expert on eating disorders, 

and I’m fortunate enough to never 
have been the victim of one. For this 
reason, I was hesitant to write this 
article. Who am I to talk about these 
things when the only perspective 
I have is of someone who can 
understand the temptation, but has 
never actually been there herself. 

Out of self-doubt, I asked a few 

friends to read this article, and 
subsequently each of them echoed 
feeling “borderline eating disorder” 
in the past. The position I’m in is 
not uncommon, so what’s to keep 
the scales from tipping? There’s 
more encouragement to succumb to 
these pressures than to go against 
popular images of attractiveness to 
create your own vision of health.

It’s easy to become desensitized 

to this topic, which is why my 
original reaction to my sister’s 
comment 
was 
so 
understated. 

Perhaps it’s because there are 
countless articles, just like mine, 
calling for attention to the fact that 
jokes about body image mask very 
real turmoil within. At the time, 
while I listened to my sister’s words, 
I was one of those desensitized 
people. It’s only after experiencing 
it in a tiny way, and being exposed to 
it through friends and family, that I 
understand the gravity of this issue 
is fundamentally overlooked.

L

et’s establish something right 
off the bat: Knowing things is 
the worst.

I’m not refer-

ring to some sort 
of “ignorance is 
bliss” 
ideology, 

or the distress of 
comprehending 
the world’s prob-
lems, or even the 
annoyance 
of 

being unable to 
recall something 
you 
are 
posi-

tive you know 
when you suddenly need it. Rather, 
knowledge is the worst because 
of the frustration I get from try-
ing to remember what it was like 
not to know something. It’s some-
thing that educators and people in 
communications positions under-
stand deeply and must deal with 
constantly: the challenge of com-
municating or teaching something 
you understand to someone who is 
uninitiated to the topic.

It’s terrible.
This problem, called the “Curse of 

Knowledge,” is something I run into 
primarily in two very specific situa-
tions: when writing essays about top-
ics I’m entirely familiar with, and 
when I’m talking to kids and trying 
to remember what I knew at their 
age. Had I already learned about 
the planets in this grade? Would it 
be strange for me to ask this student 
what they might want to study after 
high school? When was it that I real-
ized that the only thing I really need 
to know is that the mitochondria is 
the powerhouse of the cell?

Thus, I’m taking a very special 

opportunity here to lay out some of 
my current knowledge and assump-
tions on a very specific topic before I 
have the chance to ruin it with actual 
experiences. This weekend, I’m turn-
ing 21 (insert party horn noises here), 
and I will be permitted by federal 
law to partake in the consumption of 
ethanol. Along with this rite of pas-
sage, there will come some oppor-
tunities to try certain activities I’ve 
never had the (legal) opportunity to 
try out — namely, bar-hopping. Cur-
rently, I have a variety of sources and 
media that I can draw on to paint a 
picture of what I think bar life is like, 
but I really can’t be sure just yet what 
is and isn’t true.

So, to date, the mental picture I 

have of bar-going is this: My night 
will start with either an encounter 
with a meaty bouncer outside a bar 
whom I must battle for entrance, 
or I will kick my way through dou-
ble doors to stand in some dusty, 
sepia-colored light while the saloon 
goes quiet. Considering my plans 
for my birthday outing, both seem 
 

equally possible.

Then, I will hang out for hours in 

the same booth with my friends and 
our rotating cast of significant oth-
ers (or did I just get that from “How 
I Met Your Mother?”). At some point, 
there will be a bar fight. Guaranteed. 
It will also possibly be over me, but 
that isn’t guaranteed. It might just be 
over misplaced testosterone.

I realize that some bars are differ-

ent, so some elements of any of these 
possibilities are circumstantial. For 
instance, I’m aware that it’s only in 
particular lounge-like bars that I will 

need to drape myself over a piano and 
sing seductively. Other venues might 
require some seductive dancing 
instead. The bottom line is that I will 
at least be seducing someone (some 
people?) somehow.

Later in the night, I will find 

myself sitting across the bar from 
a worldly and wise bartender who 
will listen to my stories and give 
me sage advice like “That’s rough, 
buddy” and “Please stop opening 
those sugar packets and dumping 
them on the counter. Where did you 
even find those?” Before the night is 
over, we will partake in a piece of 
classic banter: They try to cut me 
off and I claim that I know when 
I’ve had enough. They will then 
nod with approval and I will know 
that I have finished the last stage of 
initiation into bar life. I’ve made it.

Basically, what I’m getting out of 

this exercise is that, even without the 
“Curse of Knowledge,” I have no idea 
what I’m doing, and I’m glad I have 
some older friends to take care of me.

So, there’s my baseline of my 

20-year-old thinking concerning 
my bar expectations: ignorant but 
probably not too far off. I plan to 
use this article in the future as a 
resource to support a larger argu-
ment about how stupid past me 
was — something that far-distant-
future me is probably also thinking 
about not-so-far-distant me as well. 
This is the beauty and the progres-
sion of the “Curse of Knowledge,” 
to always look back on your past self 
and cringe. Nature is amazing.

No help for the highways

The state legislature should be more specific in its road plans

FROM THE DAILY

Y

ear after year, Michigan’s roads deteriorate at a rate that 
ongoing repairs cannot keep up with. In an attempt to 
finally address this issue, the state legislature recently 

passed a comprehensive bill that promises to provide an additional 
$1.2 billion to the Michigan Department of Transportation and 
local governments over the next six years. Despite the near-
unanimous agreement that our roads are in need of repair, the 
spending package — backed largely by Republicans — has proven 
to be quite controversial. While apparent improvements to roads 
are needed now, the proposed solution delays action for years and 
isn’t transparent about its spending re-prioritization. Though highly 
unlikely, Gov. Rick Snyder should consider vetoing the proposed bill 
in the hope of passing a more specific road infrastructure plan. 

Currently, the Michigan public road system 

is the ninth-largest in the nation. Though 
the road system is extensive, just 19 percent 
of Michigan’s local government leaders rate 
their county’s roadways as being in good 
condition. Similarly, the average Detroit-area 
motorist pays $536 on car repairs due to poor 
road conditions, and the annual statewide 
cost of crashes resulting from road conditions 
totals $2.3 billion.

The bill currently on its way to Snyder’s 

desk is hardly the state’s first attempt to 
improve our roadways. In early May, voters 
were presented with Proposal 1, a referendum 
that aimed at increasing funding for highways 
through a 1-percent sales-tax increase, 
alongside other measures. The proposal was 
voted down during the state’s spring election 
with a record-shattering vote of roughly 1.4 
million to 351,000. Many of those who voted 
against the proposal felt it placed an unfair 
burden on households, which is a similar 
sentiment to the opposition the current bill 
faces. However, the public will not have a say 
on the recent roads package since it isn’t a 
ballot initiative.

The proposed legislation stipulates that a 

portion of its funding will come from cuts to 
the state’s general fund. The fund — which 
is responsible for financing state initiatives, 
such as education, healthcare and other public 
services — totaled approximately $10 billion 
at the close of the last fiscal year. Over the 
past few years, the Snyder administration 
has slashed the general fund, including a $103 
million cut that shifted money away from the 
State Police, the Department of Education 
and Department of Environmental Quality to 
decrease the budget deficit. It’s difficult to find 
an area in the general fund that hasn’t been 

diminished by deficit-reduction measures 
and even harder to find an area that is able to 
endure further decreases in funding. 

The Michigan Legislature should have 

specified within the bill currently before 
Snyder exactly what funds will be cut from 
the general fund. This would make Michigan 
residents more aware of potential harmful 
effects of the bill. Currently, the bill offers 
no such specificity, so few assumptions can 
be made other than the fact that critical state 
services could suffer from lower funding.

With a $600 million cut to the general 

fund accounting for half of the bill’s costs, 
the remaining half must come from other 
sources. If Snyder signs the bill into law, 
Michigan citizens would pay more out of 
pocket for vehicle-related costs through a 
20-percent increase in vehicle registration 
fees and an additional fuel tax of 7.3 cents 
 

per gallon.

Though this new tax is presented as an 

equitable solution, the bill’s sponsors do not 
recognize its potential negative impacts on 
certain segments of the population. The new 
policy is effectively a regressive tax — one 
that disproportionately affects citizens of 
lower socioeconomic status.

For a better infrastructure, the state 

legislature must work toward a bipartisan 
solution that spreads the costs in a fairer 
distribution. Additionally, our lawmakers 
must recognize that further cuts to the 
state’s general fund will have significant 
consequences 
for 
citizens 
throughout 

Michigan. The state legislature cannot 
continue 
diminishing 
crucial 
programs 

like public education and health care; our 
government must consider alternative ways 
to raise revenue to improve the road system.

The things we don’t 

like hearing 

TO THE DAILY: 

I’m a proud liberal. I was raised 

in an intellectual household by two 
politically active parents who taught 
me to stand up for those less fortu-
nate than me, those who are bullied 
and oppressed, and to fight for the 
rights of all humans.

What happened at Yale Univer-

sity and the University of Missouri 
this week frightens me. I watched 
the videos. I saw an assistant pro-
fessor, a woman whose job it is to 
teach and stand up for the rights of 
all students, harass and threaten a 
student photographer for taking pic-
tures on public property because he 
was encroaching on a “safe space.” I 
saw students lose their minds that 

a professor would encourage the 
exchange of varying ideas because 
they feel “threatened.” I saw people 
standing up for what they mistaken-
ly believe is their right to stamp out 
voices they don’t agree with.

But the most disheartening thing I 

saw was a young Yale student scream-
ing the words, “(College) is not about 
creating an intellectual space … It’s 
about creating a home here.”

I don’t know about anyone else, 

but I chose to spend tens of thou-
sands of dollars to go to school 
so that I could surround myself 
with ideas and philosophies and 
to learn. If I wanted a “home” or a 
“safe space” that shelters me from 
things that might offend me, I could 
have just stayed home with my par-
ents. We must ask ourselves: is this 
the mentality that will inherit the 
world? It’s one I want no part of, and 

it’s one that scares me.

What about an idea makes a per-

son feel “unsafe,” anyway? There’s 
no threat of physical violence from an 
idea, certainly. The way I see it, what 
it comes down to is basically students 
saying, “I don’t like that people are 
allowed to disagree with me. Change 
it or I will leave the college.” If that’s 
the case for you, maybe you should 
leave. Education is too important to 
bend to your every need.

I hope you don’t leave. I hope you 

find the strength to hear other peo-
ple say things that you may not like. 
I hope you learn that disagreeing is 
not the same thing as not listening. I 
hope you learn to learn.

I’m a proud liberal. This is not the 

liberalism I know

Asking the hard questions

 TO THE DAILY:

The 
Diversity 
Summit 
is 
underway. 

Between Nov. 3 and Nov. 14, we have been, and 
will be, coming together for talks, panels, cafe 
discussions, a community assembly with Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel and more, all 
to mark a collective re-commitment to diver-
sity, equity and inclusion on campus. Many of 
us are hard at work, developing a strategic plan 
that will map the future.

Our summit coincides with a week during 

which, on campuses across the country, stu-
dents walked out, rose up, went on strike and 
banded together in response to racist acts and 
a climate that harbors them. In Berkeley, Calif., 
high school students protested the discovery 
of a computer message that included a racial 
epithet, references to the Ku Klux Klan and 
lynching. In New Haven, Conn., Yale Univer-
sity students gathered to demand a response 
to the exclusion of Black female students from 
a fraternity party. In Columbia, Mo., a student 
hunger striker has been joined by members of 
the football team in a protest against the use of 
racial slurs and the posting of swastikas.

We are not strangers to racist acts and 

exclusion at the University. The #BBUM cam-
paign grew out of this atmosphere. Students 
responded to a theme party, “World Star 

Hip Hop Presents: Hood Ratchet Thursday,” 
which drew upon negative stereotypes of Afri-
can American culture. #BBUM, the “1,000 
Speak Out for Racial Justice” and the discus-
sions that followed reveal how our campus is 
not yet the equitable and inclusive community 
to which we aspire.

The Diversity Summit is an opportunity to 

talk about hard questions. What can we learn 
from the examples in Berkeley, New Haven, 
Missouri and elsewhere? How does our Uni-
versity address incidents on campus? Can we 
prevent them in the future? Will the diversity 
initiative tackle issues like policing and racial 
profiling? How might the University’s strate-
gic plan foster a safe, inclusive and equitable 
climate? How will the University address 
racial tensions in classrooms, residence halls, 
elsewhere on campus and in the Ann Arbor 
community?

Be there, be heard.

O’Korn makes impact on scout team

Houston transfer 
impresses coaches 

with intensity, 

ability to prepare

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

When John O’Korn made the 

decision to transfer to Michigan 
last winter, he was viewed as 
one of a glut of quarterbacks 
Jim Harbaugh had to work with 
during his first few months on the 
job.

The junior quarterback from 

Houston, however, has had a 
different role than the rest of 
them. Unlike Jake Rudock, Shane 
Morris, Wilton Speight, Zach 
Gentry and Alex Malzone, the 
other scholarship quarterbacks 
on Michigan’s roster, O’Korn is 
unable to play this season because 
of NCAA transfer rules.

Other than Rudock, O’Korn 

has had more playing experience 
than the rest of the Wolverines’ 
quarterbacks. He started 11 out 
of 13 games for the Cougars as a 
freshman in 2013, throwing for 
3,117 yards, 28 touchdowns and 10 

interceptions. He was named the 
American Athletic Conference’s 
Rookie of the Year after the 
season.

O’Korn, though, struggled as a 

sophomore, and was relegated to 
the bench after starting the first 
five games of the season under 
a new offensive coordinator. He 
made the decision to transfer to 
Michigan after the 2014 season.

While he won’t see the field for 

the Wolverines this year, O’Korn 
plays a key role 
for the team 
in 
practice, 

leading 
the 

scout-team 
offense. 
He 
mimics 

the 
looks 
of 

Michigan’s 
opponents, 
preparing the 
defense 
for 

what will come 
its way Saturday.

He doesn’t take the task lightly.
“He’s a competitor, a great 

quarterback,” 
said 
Michigan 

defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. 

Durkin. “He doesn’t take any 
B.S. from the defense at all. 
That’s why I like him. He’s got 
a little feistiness to him. I think 

he’s got a really bright future at 
quarterback.”

He will have his chance. The 

starting quarterback spot for next 
season will be very much up for 
grabs once Rudock departs, and 
O’Korn is expected to be in the 
mix.

O’Korn 
and 
Rudock 
are 

currently 
roommates. 
They 

attended St. Thomas Aquinas 
High School in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla. together, though Rudock is 

two years older 
than 
O’Korn. 

The experience 
of living with 
Rudock, 
according 
to 
Michigan 

passing 
game 

coordinator 
Jedd Fisch, has 
helped O’Korn.

“They study 

with 
each 

other, they test one another,” 
Fisch said. “You know, you 
can’t play this game if you only 
look at it within the confines of 
these walls. It’s an opportunity 
for them to go out, and John’s 
growth occurs because of the 
fact that he’s constantly testing 
Jake. It’s like a teacher-student 

type deal. He’s learning from it, 
and they’re continuing to switch 
responsibilities there.”

Because Fisch generally works 

with the first-team offense, he 
doesn’t see much of O’Korn in 
practice when he plays with 
the scout team. He has been 
impressed, though, by what he 
has seen from O’Korn in the 
meeting room. The quarterback 
doesn’t have the demeanor of 
someone who knows he isn’t 
going to play this season.

Fisch has studied O’Korn’s 

game in the past, both from 
when the quarterback was in 
high school and Fisch was the 
offensive coordinator at Miami, 
and from when O’Korn was at 
Houston. In Fisch’s eyes, little has 
changed.

“He’s got a gifted arm, he’s a 

good athlete, and it means a lot to 
him,” Fisch said.

Whether that translates into a 

starting job next season has yet to 
be determined.

‘D’ plays big in big spots

Wolverines’ stats 
solid in red zone, 
in second half, on 

third down

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

By now, just about everyone 

who follows Michigan football 
knows about the team’s stout 
defense.

The 14th-ranked Wolverines 

are first in the nation in scoring 
defense, second in yards allowed 
and are one of just four teams 
in the country to hold every 
opponent under 30 points this 
year.

But unlike other top defenses, 

Michigan’s key to success isn’t 
turnovers, sacks or defensive 
touchdowns, it’s the ability to 
make stops in any situation.

Red zone

Michigan has done a nice job 

keeping teams out of the red zone, 
leading the nation with just 16 
trips allowed. Three of the team’s 
opponents didn’t even reach the 
red zone. But once teams do get 
close to the Wolverines’ end zone, 
the defense really starts to shine.

Fans 
will 
remember 

Michigan’s goal-line stand as 
time expired to beat Minnesota 
on Oct. 31, but they can also the 
credit the defense for its effort a 
week later. Rutgers found holes 
in the unit and made it to the red 
zone four times, coming away 
with just nine points.

“Our red zone defense was 

outstanding again today,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
after Saturday’s win. “It’s been 
something that’s really been good 
for us. Our defensive coaching 
staff is doing a tremendous job. 
I don’t know if anybody’s doing 

a better job of playing defense in 
the red zone. A couple times they 
had the ball in the scoring area 
inside the 20 and we only allowed 
field goals. The only touchdown 
came on the kickoff return, so 
that’s very impressive to me.”

On the season, the Wolverines 

are allowing just 3.56 points 
per red-zone trip — fifth in the 
country. Additionally, Michigan’s 
six 
touchdowns 
allowed 
in 

16 trips is the fourth-lowest 
touchdown rate in the country.

“You never want to allow 

a team in the red zone,” said 
senior linebacker Joe Bolden. 
“But when you get backed up, 
it finally hits you and you can’t 
break. Ultimately, when they’re 
in the red zone, you want to hold 
them to three points. I think our 
mindset, our defensive mindset, 
is we don’t want them to have 
even three points.”

Third downs

Before the red zone — where 

the vast majority of possessions 

against Michigan end — the 
Wolverines are the nation’s 
second-best third-down team. 
Even when offenses get creative, 
desperate 
and 
aggressive, 

Michigan stands tall. Just 21.8 
percent of opponents’ third-
down attempts are successful, 
down 17 percent from last 
season.

“Our mentality is just to get off 

the field,” said junior defensive 
end Taco Charlton. “From the 
first play of the drive, our goal is 
to get off the field. And when it’s 
third down, every guy is thinking 
of how they can be aggressive or 
help.

“I feel like we do a good job 

overall, but when we know we 
have a chance to end the drive 
and give the momentum back to 
the offense, all 11 guys see that.”

The Wolverines have been the 

best in the country at getting off 
the field this season. They lead 
the nation in punts per play, with 
12.2 percent of opponent’s plays 
resulting in a punt — an average 
of seven plays per drive.

Second half

Perhaps the scariest part 

of Michigan’s defense is that 
it 
doesn’t 
slow 
down. 
The 

Wolverines allow 6.2 points per 
game in the first half, but that 
pace improves to 5.22 in the 
second half. While the rest of the 
players get tired, the defense gets 
stronger.

That 
endurance 
was 
on 

display Saturday. After allowing 
69 points in the previous five 
halves 
combined, 
Michigan 

buckled down, holding Rutgers 
to 105 yards and zero points.

After having its shutout streak 

snapped against Michigan State 
and 
Minnesota, 
Michigan’s 

defense looked back to its normal 
self.

“We don’t want to give up 

anything,” Charlton said. “We 
don’t like giving up yards, 
we don’t like giving up first 
downs. We want to be a stingy 
defense.”

They are, especially when it 

counts.

VOLLEYBALL
No. 11 Wisconsin 
sweeps Michigan

Wolverines lose 
fourth straight 

match, drop to 6-9 

in Big Ten play

By ETHAN WOLFE

For the Daily

While Michigan hoped to get 

itself back on track in the Big 
Ten, No. 11 Wisconsin had other 
plans.

Highlighted by a powerful 

offense, the 
Badgers 
(11-4 
Big 

Ten, 
19-6 

overall) beat the Wolverines 
(6-9, 16-10) handily in three sets, 
giving Michigan its fourth loss 
in a row. Wisconsin has caused 
many problems for the Wolver-
ines, who have not beaten the 
Badgers since October 2013.

Sophomore 
outside 
hitter 

Caroline 
Knop 
believes 
the 

team’s recent misfortunes have 
begun to snowball.

“We’ve just 

gotta step back 
and play our 
game and relax 
and have fun 
out there,” said 
Knop. 
“We 

need to go back 
to the basics: 
why we started 
the game, why 
we love the game.”

In a game that featured many 

errors for Michigan, it was never 
able to find any rhythm.

The 
Wolverines’ 
strongest 

set was the first set, when they 
managed to tie the game, 14-14, 
which led to a Wisconsin time-
out. The Badgers finished the 

set on an 11-6 run, winning the 
set, 25-20. Michigan could only 
muster a .147 attack percentage 
to Wisconsin’s .267 attack per-
centage.

The 
Wolverines 
dropped 

their final two sets, 25-19. The 
third set showcased Michigan’s 
weakest set performance of the 
season with a .000 attack per-
centage.

“We’re not executing at a high 

enough level,” Knop said. “We’re 
not playing consistent volley-
ball, and that needs to change in 
practice.”

Knop, who has led the team 

the past five games in kills, led 
the way again with a team-high 
eight kills and 10 digs.

Despite Knop’s stellar perfor-

mance lately, she has kept her 
focus on the team.

“It’s not about me at all,” Knop 

said. “If I hit negative for these 
past five games and we won five, 
I would trade for that in a heart-
beat. That means everyone is 
playing at a high level and being 
consistent night in and night out.”

Michigan coach Mark Rosen 

believes 
mis-

takes 
and 

inconsistent 
play led to the 
loss.

“We’re 
not 

getting enough 
kills. 
We’re 

making 
too 

many errors,” 
Rosen 
said. 

“We had 22 errors, and that is 
too many. You could see us get-
ting frustrated.

“We make two less errors and 

turn them into kills and then we 
have the same attack percentage 
as them. There’s lots of periods 
where we’re doing good stuff, but 
we’re not executing consistently.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Kim Barnes Arico’s team has missed the NCAA Tournament in two straight years.
Michigan’s next 
step is an NCAA 
Tournament bid
Y

es, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team made it 
to the WNIT semifinals 

last season. 
Yes, it was 
great for the 
Wolverines 
to have an 
extra month 
to practice, 
compete 
and extend 
the seniors’ 
careers. And 
yes, Michigan 
was closer 
than ever before to hanging its 
first banner.

But the important part of 

that postseason run in April 
is that it pumped life back 
into the program itself. For a 
team that dropped too many 
one- or two-possession games 
during the regular season and 
suffered through some major 
inconsistencies, the WNIT gave 
the Wolverines a chance to prove 
they had the tenacity to beat 
quality opponents.

Though the WNIT was a 

second chance for Michigan, it’s 
no longer the goal. During the 
team’s media day in October, 
players made it clear that 
their focus was on the NCAA 
Tournament.

Junior guard Siera Thompson 

has had enough of the 
alternative.

“The last two years, I’ve 

been in the WNIT,” Thompson 
said. “It’s cool to still be playing 
in March or whatever, but we 
all obviously want to be in the 
NCAA Tournament. We weren’t 
satisfied with being in the 
WNIT. That’s our goal this year: 
not to let games slip away, like 
we did last year in conference.

“We don’t want the minimum. 

We want everything we can get.”

According to junior guard 

Danielle Williams, that is 
exactly the theme of the season: 
carpe omnia, which translates 
from Latin to “take everything” 
or “take it all.” There is an even 
larger emphasis on becoming 
“the hardest-working team 
in America,” but carpe omnia 
is sparking a higher level of 
motivation and competition 
within the team.

Considering that the 

Wolverines had all but won 
the WNIT Semifinal against 
UCLA before a few critical 
errors gave the Bruins a path 
into the championship, it makes 
sense that Michigan is focused 
on taking it all. Instead, the 
Wolverines learned what it was 
like to lose it all.

“Last year, we were so 

close (to making the NCAA 
Tournament), so that also drives 
us,” said sophomore guard 
Katelynn Flaherty. “I mean, we 
played against some great teams 
in the WNIT, and we should’ve 
beat UCLA. I believe that we had 
the game. That shows not only 
to me, but to the rest of the team, 
that we can compete with the 
best out there.”

The Wolverines did just that 

in their 109-39 win over Ferris 

State in Sunday’s exhibition 
game. Under fourth-year 
head coach Kim Barnes Arico, 
Michigan is loaded with 
underclassmen who are ripe to 
make huge leaps in their career. 
Barnes Arico certainly doesn’t 
lack options to choose from.

As for the returners, they’re 

still carrying a jolt of energy left 
behind by the WNIT run. Maybe 
they still hold a bit of anger, 
which has fueled their drive 
toward reaching carpe omnia.

“We were so angry and so 

upset the way that we had gone 
out of the Big Ten Tournament,” 
said senior guard Madison 
Ristovski. “We carried over that 
anger and put it into practice and 
put it into those games, and try to 
make the end of the year better.”

If that mentality holds firm, 

the team can be successful by the 
time the Big Ten schedule rolls 
around.

Sure, the Wolverines are at an 

enormous disadvantage without 
Cyesha Goree, Nicole Elmblad 
and Shannon Smith. The team is 
going to have to go the extra mile 
even to come close to making 
up for the production the senior 
class left behind on the court, 
but Ristovski said she doesn’t see 
why freshmen can’t do it, adding 
that the returners may even have 
to inhibit new roles.

For Barnes Arico, now is the 

time to make some important 
changes, the time to take her 
best returning players and 
evolve them into new type of 
players that they couldn’t have 
been last season, all while 
nurturing the development of 
key players like freshman center 
Hallie Thome.

It’s a unique time for the 

program, and Barnes Arico is the 
right person to be at the head of it 
— the program recently extended 
her contract through the 2020-21 
season.

This time around, the WNIT 

isn’t going to cut it. Only an 
appearance in the NCAA 
Tournament will, which is 
exactly what the team talked 
about during its fall break retreat.

“What rose up is, ‘Why not 

us, why not now?’ ” Ristovski 
said. “The possibility of a 
championship is in our grasp. 
It’s just what we do every day in 
practice that’s going to decipher 
whether we win or lose (crucial 
games).”

Why not now? Now is a better 

time than ever before. Michigan 
is well-equipped with a variety 
of talented returners, a nearly 
undefeated freshmen class and a 
veteran coaching staff.

The Wolverines are in the 

midst of a revival, one that could 
make their program feared by 
non-conference and conference 
opponents, alike. It may not 
happen this year, but it also 
might.

Though one thing is for 

certain: Michigan is going to try 
its best to take it all. Carpe omnia.

2015 PREVIEW
WOMEN’S
BASKETBALL

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Kim Barnes Arico knows 

replacing the productive trio of 
Cyesha Goree, Shannon Smith 
and Nicole Elmblad will be one 
of the most difficult challenges 
she’s faced thus far in her coach-
ing career.

After graduating the three 

seniors 
who 
finished 
their 

senior years with a 20-15 record 
and a trip to the WNIT semifi-
nal, the Michigan women’s bas-
ketball coach retained a squad of 
just four scholarship juniors and 
seniors.

A group of five sophomores 

and four freshmen make up the 
core of the Wolverines’ 2015-16 
roster.

As in years past, the guard 

position is stacked and will give 
Barnes Arico plenty of options 
off the bench. Michigan will 
likely have to use its range of 
shooters to make up for its great-
est weakness — a lack of proven 
depth in the low post. The Daily 
breaks down the Wolverines’ 
2015-16 roster below:

Guards

The 
collection 
of 
guards 

Barnes Arico has assembled 
may be as deep and talented as 
any other unit she’s had in Ann 
Arbor.

The Wolverines return two 

starters at the position — juniors 
Siera 
Thompson 
and 
Dani-

elle Williams — while fresh-
men Lauren ‘Boogie’ Brozoski 
and Nicole Munger add to the 
already impressive group. As a 
result of the depth at the posi-
tion, Barnes Arico has decided 

she’ll be playing with three 
guards on the court in most situ-
ations.

Thompson is expected to be 

the leader at the point of Michi-
gan’s three-guard lineup. The 
junior is the Wolverines’ most 
experienced player at the ‘1,’ 
starting 65 of 69 games she has 
appeared in. Thompson has 
proven not only to be a shooter, 
scoring 12.1 points per game, 
but also a hard worker in other 
areas.

Despite her proven abilities, 

Thompson’s starting spot isn’t 
100-percent secure with Bro-
zoski pushing her from behind 
every day. With great hustle and 
quick hands, the freshman’s raw 
defensive skill has gotten the 
attention of Barnes Arico. In 
Sunday’s exhibition against Fer-
ris State, Brozoski entered the 
game at the head of Michigan’s 
press, and wreaked havoc for 
Bulldog ball handlers through-
out her first collegiate contest.

With no traditional small 

forward on the roster, the Wol-
verines plan on using two shoot-
ing guards to play on the wings. 
Michigan’s star scorer off the 
bench last season, sophomore 
Katelynn Flaherty, will occupy 
one of the starting wing posi-
tions. Flaherty is primed to have 
a breakout season, not only as a 
spot-up shooter who shot 42 per-
cent from the field last year, but 
also in other areas. The sopho-
more worked hard on her physi-
cality over the summer, and will 
look to drive to the basket and 
become more of an inside pres-
ence as the season rolls on.

Flaherty is expected to face 

tough defensive assignments 
in most games, and will need 

help from the Wolverines’ other 
shooters to overcome the chal-
lenge. Senior Madison Ristovs-
ki started alongside Flaherty 
against Ferris State, and will 
likely be opposite the sopho-
more a majority of the time. 
Ristovski has been a consistent 
scorer for Michigan through-
out her career, shooting 41 per-
cent overall and 39 percent from 
behind the arc.

Right behind Ristovski, Wil-

liams and Munger are fight-
ing to earn important roles in 
Barnes Arico’s lineup as well. 
Williams started 20 games last 
season, but wasn’t an offen-
sive threat, as she scored just 
35 points. The junior will most 
likely be a defensive specialist 
and will look to build upon the 11 
multi-steal games she recorded 
in 2014-15.

Munger will look to fill a 

role similar to Flaherty’s last 
year — Michigan’s lights-out 
shooter coming off the bench. 
Her defensive skills may not be 
at a point where Barnes Arico 
feels comfortable handing her 
a larger role, but Munger will 
be present in situations when 
the Wolverines need points in a 
hurry.

Forwards

The Wolverines graduated 

59 percent of their rebounding 
from last season, and figuring 
out how that number will be 
replaced has been one of Barnes 
Arico’s biggest challenges over 
the offseason. Sophomore Jil-
lian Dunston is the retuning 
forward who grabbed the most 
boards for Michigan in 2014-15, 
at 2.6 per game.

Dunston’s primary role, how-

ever, will be coming off the 
bench behind senior Kelsey 
Mitchell. After injuries have 
hampered a majority of her 
career, Mitchell was finally 
healthy this preseason, and has 
impressed Barnes Arico both on 
and off the court.

The forward position thins 

out after Mitchell and Dunston. 
Freshman Sam Trammel may 
see playing time if the others in 
front of her get into foul or inju-
ry trouble. Otherwise, Barnes 
Arico may have to turn to guard-
heavy lineups to make up for a 
lack of depth at the post.

Center

At 6-foot-5, freshman Hallie 

Thome was a giant recruit-
ing win for Barnes Arico. The 
Wolverines 
need 
a 
special 

frontcourt talent if they plan 
on contending in the Big Ten, 
and Thome has the potential to 
be just that. Thome scored 19.5 
points, grabbed 9.1 rebounds 
and blocked 4.6 shots per game 
in her senior high school season. 
The Gatorade State Player of the 
Year in Ohio brings the com-
bination of height and finesse 
the Wolverines have not seen in 
recent years.

Sophomore Terra Stapleton 

is the only other true center on 
the roster, and she logged just 33 
minutes in her freshman season. 
When Thome’s not on the court, 
the center position will most 
likely be occupied by Mitchell, 
but if the two get in foul trouble 
late in games, or are out due to 
injury, Michigan could be in real 
trouble if it needs experienced 
options to play at the post.

Daily Sports Writer

An icy chill filled the ocean air as shredded 

wooden boards lay broken on the streets of Point 
Pleasant, N.J. Winds ripped houses from their roots, 
and sand and water covered the ruined beach town. 
Hurricane Sandy’s victims tucked into a nearby 
school gym.

The evacuees inside stayed warm, avoiding the 

cold, treacherous weather. Those who lived in sight 
of the coast were forced out of their homes, leaving 
belongings behind, engulfed by the storm. 

One girl, who lived just outside the flood’s reach, 

always used to run outside, but her usual route on 
the shore’s boardwalk was destroyed, flipped and 
swallowed in the deluge. She ran wherever she 
could, away from the scattered debris and past the 
empty remains of one former house followed by 
another. Or when she wasn’t outside, she was down 
in the basement, dribbling in the dark for hours in 
a house without electricity. The now-splintered, 
desolate borough had taken the punch.

The girl had to be tough. She needed to run 

because she had to stay fit. Basketball season was 
coming, and soon, everybody was going to be 
impressed with Katelynn Flaherty.

***

Katelynn Christine Flaherty played her first 

organized basketball game as a kindergartner in a 
first-grade league, began playing against the best 
high-schoolers when she was 13 and, at that age, 
drew attention from then-St. John’s and current 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. A younger 
Flaherty used to watch the best guards in the NBA 
on television — she’s a big Kobe Bryant fan — and 
dream of the opportunity to be like Connecticut’s 
Maya Moore on the national championship stage.

With two parents who played college basketball, 

her father at Seton Hall and mother at The College of 
New Jersey, sports were always Flaherty’s first love. 
She and her father would go out in the backyard and 
hit softballs or shoot around during the summers. 
Flaherty’s father Tom, a guard in his time, taught 
her from the beginning, and he was her AAU coach 
for all four of her high school years.

“You’re gonna be great at something,” Flaherty’s 

dad used to tell her.

Whether she succeeded in academics, with 

basketball or both, making a name for herself was 
just a matter of time.

If anyone was equipped for a career in 

basketball, it was Flaherty, with all the resources 
and knowledge about the sport at her fingertips. 
But even that couldn’t differentiate her from the 
abundant talent base where she grew up. To stand 
out from the crowd, Flaherty had to do it all from 
within. 

She had a “refuse-to-lose” attitude, as Barnes 

Arico put it. She was occasionally caught up in 
the finesse of scoring, but at a young age, Flaherty 
pushed to be a pinch tougher than the opponent.

Since Flaherty was an eighth grader, Barnes Arico 

watched her keep her game above the curve. She’d 
see Flaherty playing basketball on the playground, 
playing against boys, diving out on the concrete 
after loose balls.

“You’re from Jersey!” Barnes Arico still reminds 

Flaherty in practice, edging her star player to bring 
out the old-school, East Coast work engine that 
powers her.

She is one of those spot-up, lights-out, ‘get-her-

the-ball-as-soon-as-she’s-open’ kind of shooters. 
Opponents prepare for her so much that she was on 
their radar before she even showed up for classes 
her freshman year.

Michigan’s 
now-sophomore 
guard 
is 
now 

readying for another five-month-long grind after 
reeling in hype, highlights and accolades throughout 
her freshman campaign.

En route to being named the Big Ten Sixth Player 

of the Year, Flaherty appeared in every game of her 
debut season, knocking down 37.5 percent of her 
3-pointers. She set a new freshman record with 78 
3s to contribute to her 499 points, a team high that 
landed her in the top 20 for scoring in the Big Ten, 
one of just three freshmen on that list.

Her numbers attest to the praise, though while 

her teammates note she’s “a little 
shy” and “very humble,” it’s not 
just her pinpoint splash and Tim 
Duncan-esque 
modesty 
that 

make her such a great competitor.

This season, Flaherty won’t 

be able to rely on simply spotting 
up. She will be the focal point 
of a team that boasts just four 
scholarship 
upperclassmen, 

compared to nine underclassmen. 
Flaherty returns as the team’s 
leading scorer from 2014-15, and 
she wasn’t even a regular starter.

“People will be all over me,” Flaherty said of the 

upcoming season.

Last year, the team’s ‘big three’ was comprised 

of former seniors Nicole Elmblad, Cyesha Goree 
and Shannon Smith, a trio that made up for over 50 
percent of the team’s total scoring, rebounding and 
assists. After the Wolverines fell in the 2015 WNIT 
semifinal, the main focus for Barnes Arico became 
finding a way to refuel a program that was losing its 
core. If the Wolverines were going to be successful 
when the 2015-16 Big Ten season began, they would 
have to find new talent.

Flaherty knows Michigan needs someone to step 

up, and that now is her chance. She’s the face of 
the program as a sophomore, and every opponent 
knows who she is. They’ll put two defenders on her, 
trap her wherever she goes and force her to give up 
the ball. But Flaherty has never been one to take 
adversity lying down.

It all boils back down to her roots, growing up 

and playing in northern New Jersey, a populous 
hotbed of athletic talent.

To put it into perspective, according to ESPN’s 

HoopGurlz, which ranks the top 100 women’s college 
basketball prospects, 10 players in Flaherty’s recruiting 
class came out of New Jersey — the vast majority from 
northern New Jersey — the third-highest among all 
states, trailing just California and Ohio.

“People love to compete up there,” Flaherty said. 

“I don’t know what it is, but everyone’s tough. You 
look at the people going places, and it’s all New 
York/New Jersey. It’s a pride thing. You want to 
represent where you’re from and show that you’re 
the best. Every time you step out on that floor, it’s 
a battle.”

Flaherty rose out of this bunch after throwing 

down uncanny numbers her junior year of 
high school, averaging over 30 points 
per game to lead her team to 

the top of New Jersey’s state rankings.

She worked day in and day out on her ball-

handling skills, endless dribbling, perfecting the 
art that her father instilled in her since birth.

Point Pleasant is a small town on the coast 

that fills with tourists and beachgoers during 
the summer months. Around the Ocean County 
borough, a younger Flaherty could be found jogging 
on the boardwalk, playing ball out on the blacktops 
or riding her bike to the shore, and since the local 
high school enrolled just a couple hundred kids, it 
was easy for some to get trapped in the “bubble of 
Point Pleasant Beach,” as she described it.

But nestled away on the Eastern tip of the 

country, Flaherty always had aspirations to make 
her way out in whatever way she could. 

So Flaherty spent endless 

hours on the court, and 
even when she was 
off it, basketball was 
always on her mind.

***

The first wind 

came in October.

It was 2012, 

and 
President 

Barack Obama 
had 
declared 

a 
state 
of 

emergency 
as 

Hurricane Sandy 
began 
flexing 
its 

muscle all across the 
Eastern seaboard. Eyeing 
coastal 
New 
Jersey, 

Sandy’s 
hostile 
power 

was heading straight for 
Flaherty’s hometown.

Flaherty, luckily, lived about two miles in from the 

shore, but nearly everything in between was ruined.

Point Pleasant was hit hard, and the super storm 

that caused over $70 billion in damages across the 
United States left homes filled with sand, demolished 
the boardwalks and yanked apart countless 
buildings.

“(Hurricane) Irene was a year before, and no one 

thought it was gonna be that bad,” Flaherty said. 
“People didn’t listen and stayed in their homes, and 
they had to be rescued. Even after it happened, the 

National Guard was there, and 
you couldn’t get past a certain 
point without ID because people 
were stealing from homes.”

One of Flaherty’s teammates 

completely lost her house as 
water 
reached 
the 
second 

floor. For the residents who did 
evacuate in time, Manasquan 
High School was the emergency 
destination. The school Flaherty 
attended 
her 
freshman 
and 

sophomore years was able to 

provide a few cots and drinkable water, but evacuees 
still had to bring everything they could.

“People were displaced,” Flaherty remembered. 

“Everything a mile in was gone.”

Without electricity or power for the following 

few weeks, Flaherty’s home remained intact, but 
still not in ideal shape. Somehow, Flaherty didn’t 
miss a day of practice.

Gyms were filled with stranded townspeople, and 

the basketball courts near the beach were lost under 
blankets of sand, but Flaherty couldn’t wait. If she 
wanted to be the best — and she so badly did — not 
even Sandy would bring her down.

The grounds outside were covered with litter, but 

she ran anyway. Her basement was dark and cold, 
but she dribbled anyway.

Flaherty just kept running, avoiding the wreckage 

and refusing to give up the basketball touch she 
had perfected since day one. When the weather 
was too much, Flaherty withdrew to the rug of her 
basement, ball in hand, and she’d sit and dribble for 

hours.
Many 

residents of 

Point Pleasant 

had to sleep and 

shower at the school 

for months afterward, 

and 
even 
now, 
three 

years removed, Flaherty still 

knows of people who haven’t 

been able to go back to their 

homes. 

Looting and crime were abundant, 

and the setbacks of Sandy, both direct 
and indirect, were evident. Still, there was 
Flaherty running outside, routinely dodging 
everything beneath her feet, sidestepping the 

storm to earn every ounce of respect she could 

muster up.
She takes pride in her hard-nosed, view-from-

below mentality. It’s where she comes from, and how 
she envisions success. She wants that challenge, to 
build a team from the ground up, to be an underdog 
who nobody expects to come out on top.

In the world of women’s basketball, it’s all about 

the Tennessees and the Connecticuts, but Flaherty 
wanted to create something new. She craved what 
Michigan had: the sense that it was almost there. It 
was, and is, a time when just a few right moves could 
push the program over the edge.

When Barnes Arico came to Michigan, the same 

year that Sandy hit, she told Flaherty that she would 
turn the program around, which enticed the then-
junior point guard. She wanted to lift the unproven 
team higher, something she had always done.

Back 
at 
Manasquan, 
Flaherty 

remembers 
when 
her 
sophomore 

year team didn’t just set a goal, but 
they made a claim: They were going to 
win the Tournament of Champions, a 
tournnament between the winners of each 
high school division in New Jersey. It’s the 

highest competition that a high school team 
can reach, and they were going to do it.

No one really believed in them, and after a 

loss for the Shore Conference title, the preseason 

statement seemed distant. Dejected and angered by 
the loss, the team turned it around.

The Manasquan Warriors made it all the way to 

the TOC finals, and in a game that strung close all 
through the fourth quarter, Flaherty rallied for 
over 20 points, and the team broke away for the 
championship. Flaherty was be named the final’s 
MVP.

It was the highlight of her high school career, an 

inconsistent four-year era.

Things didn’t work out for Flaherty at Manasquan, 

so she left for the nearby Point Pleasant Beach High 
School, just a short drive down the highway from her 
previous stomping grounds.

Midway through her senior year, after just two 

games at Point Pleasant, Flaherty had to switch 
high schools again, this time moving an hour north 
to Metuchen. Further away from her hometown, 
Flaherty lived with her grandparents for the second 
half of her senior year. But soon, her basketball 
devotion was tested again, just three quarters into 
her first game at her new school.

Flaherty leaped for a rebound and fell down 

awkwardly, crushing her foot.

“I strained all the ligaments in my foot,” Flaherty 

said. “I was out for the whole season. In my first 
game there, I jumped for a rebound and that was it.”

Flaherty had played fewer than three games 

in her senior year. With a few months remaining 
before she left for Ann Arbor, Flaherty rehabbed 
as she finished out school, but she couldn’t play the 
game she loved.

She was committed to Michigan, but grounded on 

the bench.

Few minds are as tough as Flaherty’s, though. If 

a hurricane couldn’t stop her, the injury couldn’t 
either. On a broken foot, she went back down to 
the basement. She took a seat on her chair, with a 
basketball on her side and four years at Michigan 
straight ahead, and she started to dribble. 

Ready for the challenge

“People were 

displaced. 

Everything a mile 

in was gone.”

Big Ten breakdown: 
Terps in front again

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Since the additions of Maryland 

and Rutgers to the Big Ten, 
the state of collegiate women’s 
basketball in the Midwest has 
been elevated. The Big Ten is 
now one of the most competitive 
leagues in the nation, and will be 
well-represented in the NCAA 
Tournament at the season’s end.

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team lost in the WNIT 
semifinals last season and will 
face another uphill battle to make 
it to the NCAA Tournament 
this year. With the Big Ten only 
getting stronger, the Daily breaks 
down Michigan’s top conference 
competition.

No. 6 Maryland

Entering their second season in 

the Big Ten, the Terrapins are the 
strongest team in the conference. 
Led by juniors Shatori Walker-
Kimbrough (13.5 points and 5.3 
rebounds per game last season) 
and Brionna Jones — both first-
team All-Big Ten selections last 
season — Maryland is coming 
off of two straight Final Four 
appearances. Led by Big Ten 
Coach of the Year Brenda Frese, 
the Terrapins went 18-0 in the 
conference 
last 
season 
and 

show no signs of slowing down. 
Maryland could be knocked off 
in conference play this year, but it 
wouldn’t be surprising if it ran the 
table once again.

No. 10 Ohio State

The Buckeyes return all five 

starters from last season, including 
four double-figure scorers. Coach 
Kevin McGuff said he wants his 
team to play even faster, which 
will give teams trouble since 
the starting lineup has all of last 
season’s chemistry to build on. 

Sophomore guard Kelsey Mitchell, 
the preseason Big Ten Player of 
the Year, averaged 24.9 points 
last season and will only further 
develop after a stellar freshman 
year. Ohio State advanced to 
the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament last season and has 
its sights set on a possible Final 
Four appearance this year.

No. 24 Northwestern

At Big Ten Media Day in 

October, 
Wildcat 
coach 
Joe 

McKeown said, “You know, when 
I took the job, we were voted 
12th, and there was 11 teams in 
the league.” Now he has turned 
Northwestern into a conference 
contender, with its first NCAA 
Tournament appearance since 
1997 last season. Junior forward 
Nia Coffey, who averaged 15.5 
points and 8.5 rebounds last 
season, will give teams fits on 
defense. Senior Maggie Lyon will 
provide leadership at the point 
guard position and averaged 14.2 
points in her junior year.

No. 23 Iowa

The Hawkeyes made it to the 

Sweet 16 last year but also lost 
the Big Ten’s highest scoring trio 
of all time from that team. Those 
shoes will be tough to fill, but 
the other two starters from last 
season’s squad, Whitney Jennings 
and Ally Disterhoft, will lead the 
way. Replacing 42.3 points per 
game from three starters will be 
a challenge, but coach Lisa Bluder 
knows how to replace talent 
through recruiting. She brought 
5-foot-4 guard Tania Davis — a 
former Michigan Miss Basketball 
selection 
— 
to 
complement 

Jennings at the guard positions.

Michigan State

The Spartans were on the 

outside looking in at the USA 
Today Poll but drew a No. 24 
ranking in the AP Poll. Injuries 
plagued them last season, at one 
point only being able to field seven 
players. The bulk of Michigan 
State’s scoring comes from junior 
forward Aerial Powers and junior 
guard Tori Jankoska. Powers was 
10th in the nation in scoring last 
season, averaging 21.9 points, 
while Jankoska racked up 17.5 per 
game. The Spartans only finished 
one game above .500 last season 
but will finish well above that 
mark this year if they stay healthy.

Rutgers

Led by the third-winningest 

women’s college basketball coach 
of all time, C. Vivian Stringer, 
the Scarlet Knights can never 
be counted out as competitors. 
Stringer speaks very highly of 
freshman guard KK Sanders, who 
could become a special player 
over the duration of her career 
in Piscataway. Rutgers loses one 
of its two top scorers from last 
season, but the one returning, 
Kahleah Copper (16.3 PPG) will 
likely lead the team in scoring 
again.

Nebraska

The Cornhuskers started four 

seniors in 2014, and will miss 
their collective 350 career starts 
this season. Although Nebraska 
has drastically switched from 
a veteran team to a young 
one, coach Connie Yori will 
make sure the program stays 
on track in this transition. To 
reload, Nebraska recruited Jess 
Shepard, a Lincoln native who 
was the top-ranked forward in 
the country out of high school. 
She scored 42 points in the 
Huskers’ exhibition, proof that 
she’s making an impact and will 
make headlines right away.

says his line is as fast as the snap 
of a finger.

That 
was 
evident 
during 

line rushes on Tuesday at 
the Michigan hockey team’s 
practice. Selman, senior Boo 
Nieves 
and 
freshman 
Kyle 

Connor 
brought 
the 
puck 

through the neutral zone with 
just two passes before Connor 
found twine.

“When we get the puck, next 

thing you know we’re in the 
other end,” Selman said. “Today 
we were talking at practice, and 
we’re like, ‘Wow, we’re fast — 
like two passes and we’re in the 
other end, and we scored.’ ”

None 
of 
that 
would 
be 

possible if it weren’t for the 
line’s youngest player: Connor.

The freshman joined the 

Wolverines 
as 
their 
most 

heralded recruit. It was much 
deserved, 
though, 
after 
he 

notched 195 points in three 
seasons in the United States 
Hockey League.

But 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson 
said 
players 
of 

Connor’s talent level often don’t 
realize the challenge college 
hockey presents.

“We recruit gifted players,” 

Berenson said, “and some of 
them are more receptive (to) 
learning how to play without the 
puck, and some of them don’t 
because they’ve been babied all 
the way up because they are a 
good player. ... We’re not babying 
Kyle Connor.”

Connor knows that, and he 

has been extremely coachable, 
according 
to 
Berenson. 

Moreover, 
Nieves 
said 
his 

linemate is always listening 
to him and Selman on the ice, 
which is refreshing from a 
senior’s vantage point.

However, 
if 
there’s 
one 

blemish to the freshman’s game 
through six contests, it’s his 
play without the puck and in the 
defensive zone. That’s not to say 
his play has been porous, but 
it’s something Connor — who 
has tallied three goals and four 
assists — needs to work on.

“He’s been able to freelance 

all the way up, and now all of 
the 
sudden 

he 
needs 
to 

play better in 
his own zone 
because 
he’s 

not going to 
have the puck 
all the time,” 
Berenson 
said. “He’s not 
going to be as 
dominant 
a 

player as he 
was in the U.S. Hockey League. 
He still will be able to freelance 
to a certain extent, but he will 
have to be more responsible.”

As a comparison, Berenson 

praised former forward Dylan 
Larkin, who is now a rookie for 
the NHL’s Detroit Red Wings. 

“You score your way into the 

NHL by being a talented player 
without the puck,” Berenson 
said. “Dylan Larkin wouldn’t 
be there right now if he weren’t 
one of the top plus-minuses in 
the NHL, so good for him for 
taking care of business without 
the puck.

“And that’s what Kyle Connor 

has to learn.”

The message has been made 

loud and clear to Connor, who 
has already taken the initiative 
to find ways to improve his 
100-foot game. This past week 
during the bye, Connor sat down 
one-on-one with assistant coach 
Brian Wiseman to watch each of 
his shifts against Robert Morris.

Wiseman 
helped 
Connor 

learn 
where 
he 
should 
be 

without the puck and how to 
make the correct defensive play.

“It was good to get a different 

perspective to see what the 
coaches have to say,” Connor 
said. “I think you can always 
work on it and fine-tune your 
defensive game. I think I’ve 
taken a lot of strides in my 
defensive game since my last 
year in Youngstown.”

Those strides were much 

needed. Despite notching 195 
points in three years with 
Youngstown, his plus-minus was 

minus-29. 
In 

other 
words, 

for 
as 
many 

goals he was on 
the ice — and 
that’s a ton — 
he was on the 
ice for more 
goals against.

So 
far 
at 

Michigan, 
though, he is 
already 
plus-

three through six games, and 
his offensive game has been 
invaluable to the Wolverines.

A large of chunk of that 

success stems from his ability 
to 
deceive 
goaltenders 
and 

defensemen. So while he may 
not overwhelm you with his slim 
and fragile 175-pound frame, 
before a defenseman can lay a 
hit on him, the puck is usually 
on its way to the net.

“He’s got a real exceptional 

release on the puck,” Berenson 
said. “He shoots it before the 
goalie is even ready for it. Other 
players will get it and stick 
handle it. I call that telegraphing 
the shot.”

Added 
Connor: 
“It’s 

something growing up through 
all the ranks I tried to work 
on, being indecisive and sneaky 
with my shot. At this level, all 
goalies are good, so you got to 
try new ways to beat them.”

And he has beaten them 

with the puck so far. Now, he’s 
working 
to 
beat 
opponents 

without it. 

“We recruit 

gifted players. ... 
 

We’re not babying 

Kyle Connor.”

Seven days, seven dates: Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Coffee Meets 

Bagel, Match.com and my real life best friends vying to make the perfect match.
 
For context, I have never been on a date with anyone I met online. As a 

20-year-old college senior, I in no way claim to be an expert in anything love, 
sex or relationship-related. The intent of this social exercise was to explore first-
hand some disparities between dating in real life to dating on new media. I sim-
ply posed as the subject of my own experiment, and I’m here to relay my personal 
observations.
 
Since its release as a $750 million start-up in 2012, Tinder has boasted 
 

over 9 billion matches. Match, the parent company that owns Tinder, OkCupid, 
Match.com and other dating apps, touted a $49.3 million profit in the first half of 
this year. The company just filed to go public three weeks ago. 

 
I was born in 1995. I only know of Richard Simmons 

through parodies, self-parodies and commercials, so when I 
decided to try out a new exercise routine and write about it 
in the name of journalism, the little I knew about this char-
acter was a driving factor in my decision to choose his tapes. 
Thanks to the Internet, there are a couple full-length Sim-
mons videos on YouTube, not in the HD quality we’re used 
to but in the nostalgic look of tapes from the ’80s. I was origi-
nally going to follow this routine for a week, but I figured I 
should focus my analysis on the full-length tapes available 
for free (hey, I’m a college student), instead of stumbling 
through disjointed clips.

*Disclaimer: I don’t endorse diets and I don’t particularly 
enjoy them, especially this one. I merely wanted to share my 
frivolous fable of immersion (trying to relate to celebrities 
and failing). If you’re an infant prodigy reading this right 
now, please, continue eating your baby food! It was made for 
you and your underdeveloped masticators!

 
I’m not cautiously restrictive with my food intake. I 

don’t follow any specific dietary regulations. Sometimes I 
caustically limit my gluten consumption to be ironic. Some-
times I swap skim for soy in my morning lattes simply be-
cause I prefer the taste. Sometimes I eat too much cheesy 
bread (who doesn’t?). Sometimes the next day I eat a giant 
bowl of kale for lunch because #balance. My normal diet is 
somewhere between eating what I want with sporadic, al-
beit valiant efforts to maximize longevity — namely, my four 
weekly guidelines: sipping a latte each morning (self-pam-
pering and espresso are crucial), eating two to three serv-
ings of salmon per week, brewing at least two cups of green 
or herbal tea each day and guzzling water around the clock. 
The remaining comestibles and libations are an amalgam of 
overpriced brunches, sugar-fix pilgrimages to Blank Slate 
Creamery, Espresso Royale dirty chais and the occasional 
revisit to South Quad Dining Hall with my “I’m an impover-
ished law student” brother. That’s my sustenance story.

Day One: Aerobics with 

Richard Simmons and the 

Silver Foxes

When I started this video, I 

wasn’t really sure what I expect-
ed the Silver Foxes to be. Some 
svelte figures in metallic jump-
suits were about what I had in 
mind. But alas, the Silver Foxes 
were not blondes in high pony-
tails, but instead the 70-odd-
year-old 
parents 
of 
famous 

figures from the ’80s: the moth-
ers of Farrah Fawcett, Sylvester 
Stallone and Simmons himself, 
as well as the father of Al Pacino. 
Immediately, I knew I made a 
huge mistake, but I had made a 
commitment, so I proceeded on 
my journey with the Silver Foxes.

First thing’s first — Richard 

Simmons doesn’t mess around. 
Maybe there was something in 
the water in the ’80s, but I could 
barely keep up the movement of 
my feet when paired with enthu-
siastic clapping and hip shaking. 
Mrs. Stallone had this thing down 
pat, looking like a goddess in a 
peach sweat ensemble.

It hadn’t even been 20 min-

utes of the 50-minute video 
(read: 17 minutes) when I real-
ized I desperately needed a 
water break. This is coming 
from a girl who does hot Bikram 
yoga twice a week. I’m telling 
myself this has more to do with 
the large plate of sushi I had 
eaten a couple hours earlier that 
stripped me of the moisture in 
my body than with the vivacity 
of the Silver Foxes. It was also 
around this time that I realized 
Sal Pacino looked too much like 
the father of an ex-boyfriend for 
my comfort. My concentration 
was in a shaky place, I needed 
the wisdom of Simmons’s perm 
to bring me back.

25 minutes in. Another water 

break. But I was starting to 
get why these videos were so 
popular. So soothing. So visu-
ally pleasing. I’d love to find a 
way to have Richard Simmons’s 
voice and positive energy inher-
ent in my daily life.

I don’t know if it was the jazzy 

music, the matching velour 
jumpsuits or the ever-smiling 
faces of the Silver Foxes, but 
I had a great time doing this 
video. I’ve never taken a formal 
aerobics class, so I can’t say how 
this video compares to a class 
for those born in the later half of 
the 20th century, but I definitely 
worked a bit of a sweat. Some of 
the exercises were incredibly 
goofy, like the “rump bends” that 
looked undeniably like humping 
the back of a chair. But honestly, 
the Silver Foxes were everything 
to this video. Immediately after 
it ended, I had to look up what 
happened to Jackie Stallone, 
hoping she was still doing high 
knees somewhere. However, I 
wish I hadn’t. It looks like old 
Jacks filled up too much of her 

later years with bad plastic sur-
gery and a role on “Celebrity Big 
Brother.” RIP to the image of 
that goddess in the peach sweat 
suit I briefly knew and loved. 

Day Two: Sweat and Shout

I have a confession to make: I 

took a three-day break between 
the first workout and this one. My 
workload was insane, and my sleep 
levels were subpar, so exercise fell 
to the wayside, per usual. But after 
things settled down, I settled back 
into Simmons.

This second tape starts with 

a much more flamboyant Sim-
mons backed up by a gospel 
choir singing, “Shout!” Before 
I could gain my composure, the 
dancing starts. Already, this 
tape is 100 percent more intense 
than anything the Silver Foxes 
could keep up with. The new 
cast of supporting dancers is 
brightly clad but definitely sec-
ondary characters to Simmons’s 
fabulousness. I’m not sure if 
it’s a year difference (I couldn’t 
actually find the year this video 
was made) or the absence of 
septuagenarians, but Simmons 
definitely expressed his famous 
personality in this video more 
than 
the 
last. 
After 
some 

research, I learned that Sim-
mons has never actually con-
firmed his sexuality, squashing 
my uninformed belief that he 
was some sort of gay icon.

Again, I kept messing up the 

quick movement changes while 
the backup dancers kept up per-
fectly, which led me to ques-
tion how many times they had 
to practice this one-hour rou-
tine without cameras. What if 
someone in the back messes up? 
Do they have to film the whole 
thing over again? This tape has 
literally no breaks, Simmons 
powers through one hour of 
intense dancing without slow-
ing down at all. This tape is also 
significantly more difficult than 
the Silver Foxes — I’m sorry I 
doubted you, Richard. The old-
ies soundtrack naturally made 
me want to dance, and I’m sure 
I could have reached euphoria 
if I weren’t concentrating so 
hard on keeping up with the 
moves. Like the Silver Foxes 
video, there were some weird 
humping maneuvers, this time 
done with less stable eye con-
tact with the camera and more 
vivacity, echoing the younger 
cast of the background dancers. 
Other moves had names like 
“sweating ponies” and “sham 
shammies.” Your guess to what 
those are as good as anyone’s. 

The video’s name did not lie. 

I did sweat, but I did not shout 
because my roommates were 
home and would have been con-
cerned if I had. However, I was 
very out of breath by the time 
the cool down period started. 
Doing weird stretches with my 
arms while the gospel choir 
sang (they came back just for 
the end) was oddly satisfying, 
and I felt a spiritual connection 
to the higher being which is 

Richard Simmons. My potential 
soreness the next day was left to 
be determined.

Day Three: Disco Sweat—

How to lose 15 pounds in two 

weeks

When I stepped out of bed this 

morning, there was an unmistak-
able soreness in my quads from 
my sweating and not-shouting the 
day before. Now with a definite 
sign that these workouts actually 
do something, I culminated my 
three-day experiment with what 
sounded like the hardest Simmons 
workout YouTube has to offer — 
one that guaranteed I would lose 
15 pounds in two weeks, though 
never actually specified how often 
these workouts had to be to accom-
plish this. Once a day? Twice a 
day? I’m unsure.

This time, instead of being a 

recluse in my bedroom vigorously 
dancing alone, I set up the HDMI 
cord in the living room and did the 
workout with my roommate, an 
actual dancer. Though the tapes 
were fun alone, they were defi-
nitely more exhilarating in a group 
setting; I was no longer afraid to 
sing along to the music or “whoop” 
when Simmons did. This was the 
most difficult of the Simmons vid-
eos, and my keeping up with it was 
more than debatable.

We made it a little more than 

halfway through the video, 
slightly after the dance routine 
to “I Will Survive,” when my 
roommate had an epiphany: “I 
HAVE to show you this work-
out video I used to do with my 
mom in our living room.” And 
with that, Richard was hijacked 
and replaced with Billy Blanks’s 
TaeBo workout. Richard, I’m 
so, so sorry. But if your videos 
intentionally had a twinge of 
humor, TaeBo was unintention-
ally the funniest thing I’ve ever 
seen. The background music, 
clearly made for this specific 
workout, made me feel like I was 
in a video game. And though I’m 
sure I would have gotten a fan-
tastic cardio workout with the 
mix of martial arts and aerobics, 
I genuinely could not stop laugh-
ing when Blanks would yell, 
“DOUBLE TIME,” and the room 
would go inexplicitly dark and 
the movements were twice as 
fast, looking like a fever dream. 
We only made it about halfway 
through TaeBo when we both 
called it quits, and I left with an 
unmistakable guilt toward the 
spirit of Richard Simmons.

While I can’t say if I’d 

voluntarily elect to do Simmons 
dance tapes on a regular basis 
again, I understand why people 
do. They’re fun, positive and 
make you feel good about 
yourself. While I’m not sure if 
you’d actually lose 15 pounds in 
two weeks, you probably could 
over a greater length of time, 
because holy smokes, if you put 
all your energy in it you can 
sweat bullets doing these. I’m 
glad I did my little experiment, 
but I think I’ll stick to hot yoga 
after all.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 “I just got here and I think 
I’m losing signal already....
sorry,” says a sepia-toned 
Adele, windswept upon her 
arrival 
to an old, 
abandoned 
house at 
the end of 
a secluded 
country drive. 
 And so we 
enter with her the microcosm 
of a tender, long-hidden 
memory in the balladeer’s 
latest video for “Hello.” This 
abandoned house is a time 
capsule where we relive with 
Adele the narrative of a love 
long lost. Much of the video is 
filmed from the first-person: 
her old boyfriend speaks 

directly to the camera, and 
we see Adele’s hands reaching 
out to him as if they’re the 
viewer’s own. When her ex 
isn’t talking to us, Adele stands 
next to a rusting, ivy-wrapped, 
vintage London telephone 
booth in a sun sprinkled forest 
clearing pouring her heart out, 
a perfect millennial queen.
 Though the narrative 
force behind the video isn’t 
incredibly novel, I call Adele a 
millennial queen for a reason. 
The video is heartbreaking 
but soothing to watch at 
the same time, managing to 
assuage several anxieties of 
the millennial generation. 
The entire thing is saturated 
in nostalgia: the whole video 
is filmed in sepia, Adele is 

visiting an old abandoned 
house, and although there are 
phones in the video, not one of 
them is a Smartphone. Instead 
both Adele and her former 
lover use flip phones — an 
elegy to the 2000s — or corded 
phones in the mysteriously 
placed phone booth or inside 
the house.
 Not only is she letting 
viewers enter a vintage 
fantasy; she’s also overcoming 
other social problems 
prominent in contemporary 
popular media. Adele looks 
absolutely stunning without 
conforming to the standard 
body type of the female 
celebrity, and her ex is 
Black while it’s unfortunate 
that a biracial couple in a 

mainstream music video is 
worth noting, like everything 
else in the video it definitely 
seemed purposeful. All in 
one video, Adele manages 
to answer the millennial 
obsession with nostalgia, 
overcomes unjust expectations 
on women’s bodies, and takes a 
step toward racial equality.
 Though the video doesn’t 
necessarily push artistic 
boundaries, that’s not really 
what Adele is about. She’s 
about the vintage, she’s about 
the nostalgia, and she’s about 
being a champion of capturing 
our emotions. All this she does 
in the video of her latest single, 
“Hello.”

Hello

Adele

As freshmen, my friends 

and I giggled abashedly as we 
downloaded the app – only 
to 
swipe 
sarcastically, 
we 

affirmed. Though we stood 
proudly as anti-slut shamers, 
we turned a side-eye to those 
who prowled for casual sex, 
and even more for long-term 
relationships. Especially with 
aggressive pick-up lines like, 
“Your cute wanna fuck?” — 
there has stemmed a sense 
of stigma with its use. News 
sources have criticized the 
app for “ruining romance” and 
inciting the “dawn of the dating 
apocalypse” — pinning culprit 
on the millennials who use it.

Contrarily, in New York City 

this past summer, with a much 
larger swiping vicinity, my 
coworkers’ solution to all my 
dating woes was always, “Have 
you ever tried Tinder?” In the 
Big Apple, dating apps aren’t 
taboo; they’re simply ways to 
make an isolating city intimate, 
a way to meet like-minded 
individuals 
you 
typically 

wouldn’t. In Ann Arbor, with 
less opportunity for mobility, 
stumbling across friends (or 
GSIs) on the app always feels 
too close for comfort.

However, 
John 
Cacioppo, 

a psychology professor at the 
University of Chicago, found 
that more than one third of 
marriages between 2005 and 
2012 started on the Internet. In 
his 2013 study, he ascertained 
that couples who have met 
online 
have 
1.6% 
fewer 

marriage breakups, and also 
higher marriage satisfaction 
ratings.

Currently, the average age for 

first marriage is 27 for women 
and 29 for women – a wedlock 
rate down 10% from just the 
previous generation. Though 
Cacioppo’s 
study 
proved 

positive long-term effects, how 
does online dating fare with 
casual 
relationships 
among 

millennials at a time when they 
aren’t necessarily looking for 
The One?

So, with mixed responses, I 

delved further into the world 
of cyber-romance — warily, 
but with an open mind. For 
the purposes of my study, I 
limited my age range from 22 
to 30, a pool representative 
of 
“millennials” 
— 
mostly 

upperclassmen and recent post-
grads.

On the first night, Tinder’s 

new “super-like” feature landed 
me at Marnee Thai for dinner 
with 
Matt*, 
a 
24-year-old 

University 
graduate 
student 

whom 
I 
found 
physically 

attractive 
enough 
and 
his 

profile intriguing enough to 
reciprocate his super-like.

However, like many stories 

go, his unkempt facial hair 
didn’t quite mirror the carefully 
vetted photos on his profile 
— and his bio’s claim that he 
had studied across Asia didn’t 
actually 
materialize 
itself 

into a cultured personality. 
On “paper” (online), we had 
common interests in travel, 
literature, and art museums — 
but when discussing in depth 
and in person, we realized how 
vague “commonalities” were 
really just dissimilarities.

After our two hour dinner, 

Matt still had no idea where I 
was originally from, what my 
college major was, what my 
career aspirations were — no 
details about my family, friends 
or hobbies. While I attempted 

to reciprocate genuine curiosity 
about his life in response 
to his online “super-like,” I 
never felt his real-life interest 
reciprocated back.

Had Matt and I initially met 

each other in person, it would 
have 
been 
evident 
within 

the first five minutes that we 
couldn’t be well-suited romantic 
partners. We wouldn’t have 
wasted time over a superficial 
dinner or poured effort into 
online impression management. 
However, offline — in person — 
we probably wouldn’t have had 
the chance to meet each other in 
the first place.

My Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid 

and Coffee Meets Bagel dates 
all ensued in a similar fashion 
— with men where there was 
fleeting cyber infatuation, but 
little chemistry in real life. 
Our lack of connection wasn’t 
necessarily due to a deficiency 
on my or their part. Rather, it 
was simply a lack of social and 
dispositional compatibility that 
a mobile app couldn’t possibly 
discern with six photos and a 
three-line bio.

On day two, I tried Hinge. 

While all the apps paired 
by 
proximity, 
Hinge 
took 

similarity-pairing to another 
level – matching based on 
mutual Facebook friends — 
forming connections that could 
very well be made in person in 
real life. My coffee date with 
Patrick*, a 23-year-old recent 
University grad who shared 
few acquaintances, didn’t incite 
any romantic sparks, but we 
found a platonic affability from 
which we could keep in touch as 
friends.

After OkCupid and Coffee 

Meets Bagel, I had swiped 
through many of the same 
men across the different apps. 
I felt like I had small-talked 
all of Ann Arbor to the point 
where I copied and pasted the 
same responses to the same 
stale questions: What was I 
for Halloween? Did I have a 
favorite travel destination? Did 
I want to come over that night 
at 11 p.m.?

On day five, I explored Bum-

ble, an app founded by Whitney 
Wolfe, the sole female cofound-
er of Tinder, one year after she 
sued her original company for 
sexual harassment. Inspired by 
Wolfe’s experiences with sex-
ism, Bumble contests tradition-
al gender conventions by giving 
females 24 hours to initiate 
conversation before their match 
disappears. Though the men on 
the app should presumably be 
comfortable with women mak-
ing the first move, I received 
comments calling out my “con-
fidence,” “assertive” nature and 
“forward” personality. After 
lunch with Logan*, a 25-year-
old model from London, he 
“teased” that I should pick up 
the bill — because that’s what a 
“feminist Bumble-user like (my)
self would do, right?” Though I 
generally have no issue paying 
on dates, I want my generosity 
to stem from pleasure instead of 
obligation. The criticisms that 
dating apps favored men more 
evidently peaked through.

By day six, I reached my final 

app: the dreaded Match.com. 
Notoriously a serious platform 
geared toward a middle-aged 
demographic, I worried about 
finding men in my 22-30 range. 
Unlike the five free mobile 
apps I tried, Match thoroughly 
vetted potential candidates — 
down to the minutest of prefer-
ences in both appearance and 
personality.

First and foremost, I real-

ized how appearance profiles 
weren’t based on reality — but 
rather on the confidence (or 
cockiness) with one chose to 
convey oneself. Some response 
options to the “body type” ques-
tion included: “slender,” “ath-
letic and toned,” “heavyset” and 
“a few extra pounds.” Not only 
did I have to classify myself, 
but I also had to preference the 
physique of my ideal date — as 
well as the option to make body 
type a “deal-breaker” quality. 
However, even if I demanded 
an “athletic and toned” man, I 
would only end up with some-
one who deemed himself wor-
thy of that title.

I knew I reached a red flag 

zone 
when 
inquired 
about 

my marriage history, poten-
tial children and current sal-
ary – queries rarely of careful 
contemplation to a millennial 
audience. Perhaps more dis-
turbingly, the site forced me to 
preference his relationship sta-
tus and salary range (in case I 
wanted to date a married father 
or a Sugar Daddy).

Ultimately, though I value 

Match’s careful selection pro-
cess, the site certainly revealed 
the discriminatory side of dat-
ing apps. Match.com forced 
me to be picky — but in super-
ficial terms of appearance and 
financial worth. By the end, 
both parties would have quite 
comprehensive outlines of their 
personalities and lifestyles – 
the good, the bad, and the ugly 
up for interpretation.

After navigating through the 

“winks,” “likes” and “faves” 
the site offers, I deemed one 
message 
worthy 
of 
pursu-

ing: Connor* was 29, but his 
photos coddled puppies and 
his four paragraph biography 
detailed his adventures around 
38 countries in the past year. 
His hobbies included tea, yoga, 
and simply, “massage.” I never 
would have imagined I’d be on 
a Match.com date, but there we 
sat at Mani Osteria with our 
napkins in our laps and pizza 
fresh on our plates. Compared 
to the previous five dates, it was 
actually the most pleasant, per-
haps because our similarities 
were so carefully vetted.

However, while all five of the 

apps I tried are free, Match puts 
a $16.99 per month price tag on 
the elusive concept of love — 
which consequently heightens 
the desperation to find romance 
when attached to a financial 
investment. For its target demo-
graphic, Match may be worth 
the pretty penny — but for a 
generation that isn’t looking for 
Mr. or Mrs. Right, it seems silly 
to make a monetary transaction 
for a relationship.

Another 
observation: 
dat-

ing apps bred a desperation I 
never knew I had. As a college 
senior planning to move across 
the country soon, I rarely 
yearn for romantic commit-
ment or even companionship 
at this point. However, after 
just one week perusing six dif-
ferent online sites, I developed 
a vicious addiction to checking 
and rechecking for matches — 
a guilty pleasure in selectively 
replying to messages as it gave 
me a sense of ownership over 
my dating life.

Ultimately, these are all my 

singular experiences with the 
apps — neither representative of 
all experiences, nor my future 
luck on the same apps.

A week before my experi-

ment, I had given my friends 
the task of finding me a blind 
date — a match made the “old 
fashioned” way. After seven 

DATING APPS

entire days, they returned with 
text messages from their male 
friends:

“Lol a blind date? That’s so 

weird.”

“#tbt to the 19th century.”
“How would I know she’s not 

a monster or a serial killer?”

All these messages came 

before even seeing my photo or 
learning any personal details.

Though I expected real-life 

match-making to occur much 
more organically than any app 
encounter, the guys in real life 
seemed to make the situation 
far more awkward (and frus-

trating) than any initial mes-
sage on Tinder or Match.com. 
They may often be labeled as for 
the “desperate” or the “thirsty,” 
but apps have become more 
popular for dating, regardless 
of how stigmatized.

In real life, initial face-to-

face conversations with crush-
es are (and always have been) 
clunky and terse. Perhaps the 
issue 
with 
“the 
millennial 

generation” is not that we’re 
“flighting from conversation,” 
but that we’ve reconstructed 
methods of communication to 
make us feel more comfortable 

– and in turn, make us more 
approachable.

In real life, there’s no way 35 

“matches” could (or want) to 
pine after me. Online, it’s easy 
to feel wanted — lusted after in 
the moment. However, the fal-
lacy of reality is that the initial 
desire often dissipates when 
online chemistry doesn’t trans-
late outside of cyberspace.

Ultimately, 
the 
goal 
of 

any relationship is to build 
a connection. Does it matter 
whether that’s done through 
a mutual friend or through an 
online venue?

Thursday, November 12, 2015 — 3B

Joan Didion once said, “We 

tell ourselves stories in order to 
live.” I believe that, I repeat it to 
myself often and I even reduced 
the quote to an alternative 
version that I find applicable to 
my shortcomings — “Caro tells 
herself lies in order to make up 
for her missteps.” Last Monday, 
I did just that as I promised 
myself I’d embark on a weeklong 
diet: the baby food diet. Inspired 
by Rebecca Harrington, New 
York 
Magazine’s 
designated 

celebrity dieter, and drawn 
to the possibility of having 
something in common with 
Reese 
Witherspoon 
and 

Jennifer 
Aniston 
— 
two 

unconfirmed 
advocates 
and 

survivors of the unbranded 
program — I decided to give the 
baby food diet a whirl.

After perusing Harrington’s 

canon of past experiments, I 
struggled to find one that struck 
a balance between downright 
obscure — I was particularly 
horrified by Elizabeth Taylor’s 
peanut butter and steak diet 
— and seemingly doable. So, I 
retreated to the never-ending 
remainder of the worldwide 
web and somehow came across 
the most bizarre plan of them 
all. Admittedly, I’ve replaced 
baby food for applesauce in 
countless recipes and have 
shamelessly licked the lid of the 
pull-top containers to sample it 
untainted by additional flavors. 
Prior to this attempted diet, 
I genuinely found the fruity 
flavors to exceed expectations, 
but 
steered 
clear 
of 
the 

vegetable varieties.

According 
to 
celebrity 

diet 
blogs, 
the 
unorthodox 

regimen allots those absurd 
enough to attempt adhering 
to the plan (me) a maximum 
of 14 containers of baby food 
interspersed 
throughout 
the 

day with one normal, ideally 
well-balanced meal. I knew it’d 
be a challenge, but I told myself 
I could do it!

Preparation:

Monday

Mid-Monday 
afternoon, 
I 

realized 
the 
essentiality 
of 

prep for this thing. Seeing as 
my barren cupboards house 
only teabags and Keurig cups, 
I needed to rush-order a week’s 
supply of baby food. I opted 
for three bulk variety packs 
promising an assortment of 
fruit and vegetable purees. I 
chose next-day delivery (spoiler 
alert: packages didn’t arrive the 
next day).

That night, I was fraught with 

anxiety over the application of 
this extreme regimen. I couldn’t 
rationalize why I’d ordered 
baby food earlier that day. 
Sure, babies for the most part 
inhabit ideal lifestyles — their 
cuteness is constantly validated 
and their to-do list only seldom 
extends 
performing 
basic 

bodily functions and cooing — 
but did I really want to eat like 
them?

Tuesday

Upon waking up, I tracked 

my package of infant staples. 
According 
to 
Amazon, 
it 

wasn’t 
scheduled 
to 
arrive 

until Wednesday. Excellent! I 
intended to devote the next two 
days to a slight-DIY baby food 
diet, meaning I’d physically 
shop for the food. Alas, both 
Walgreens AND Victor’s did 

not have baby food in stock, so 
I surrendered to my adult-food 
cravings and ordered sushi. I 
later dubbed this Tuesday my 
“prep day,” essentially meaning 
my version of a nightcap was a 
copious amount of fro-yo.

Wednesday

As soon as my iPhone lit 

up with the automated text 
message my apartment building 
sends 
whenever 
a 
package 

arrives in your name, I was 
uncharacteristically 
excited 

to begin my dabble in dieting. 
Directly 
after 
my 
morning 

class, I headed to my building’s 
leasing office to pick up the 
dietary delivery.

“It’s kind of heavy!” said the 

leasing office lady.

“I wonder what it is!” I 

sheepishly exclaimed. I very 
well knew what it was, I 
just didn’t see “ingester of 
baby food” an accurate first 
impression to leave this woman 
with.

As soon as I ascended to 

the fourth floor, I tore the 
box open, but all I found was 
disappointment. 
Online, 
the 

extensive product description 
promised a variety of sweet 
potato, corn, pea, apple and 
banana 
flavors, 
yet 
these 

“variety 
packs” 
merely 

contained banana, apple and 
sweet potato flavors.

Since the plan allotted me 14 

containers a day, I immediately 
tried all three, only to find my 
taste aversion to the sweet 
potato puree. I was pretty 
opposite-of-stoked about this 
since 
it 
was 
approximately 

one-third of my food intake for 
the next week. However, the 
banana and apple flavors were 
unexpectedly delicious.

After my two delicious and 

sole containers, I met up with 
a friend to study. I pretended to 
read, but actually watched said 
friend eat noodles as he scoffed 
at my mention of my new diet. 
For the remainder of the day, 
I 
was 
uncharacteristically 

un-hungry, likely due to the 
combination of conceptualizing 
a baby food-centric eating plan 
and my impending evening 
exam. Following the brutal 
exam, I limped home and simply 
passed out.

Thursday

Thursdays 
are 
my 
early 

class day with an 8 a.m. 
lab, but not even this rude-
awakening hour could deter my 
commitment to the diet. After 
all, each container decorated 
with photos of smiling babies 
radiated positivity. Side note: 
after further examining the 
packaging, 
aside 
from 
the 

cherubic infants, the words 
“made with the help of our tiny 
taste testers” were printed. 
Really? Do babies even have 
taste buds? If so, was I stupid for 
not knowing this? (I Googled it, 
and yeah, they do).

My breakfast consisted of 

three banana containers, but 
afterwards I made a mental 
note to chill with my banana 

intake. I knew I’d really hate 
myself in two days when I’d be 
forced to consider ingesting a 
sweet potato. Post-lab hunger 
led me to my one “normal 
meal,” for that day, a monstrous 
breakfast 
burrito. 
For 
the 

following meals, I consumed my 
remaining 11 containers of baby 
food. I even had an adventurous 
moment and decided to resolve 
woes with the sweet potato. 
After heavily salting, it wasn’t 
half bad. I was proud for having 
a successful diet day, yet irked 
with my bedtime hunger.

Friday

After 
my 
morning 
class, 

two friends and I decided to 
brunch at Afternoon Delight. 
Unable to resist my acclaimed 
brunching spot, I decided to 
maximize the diet and stretch 
the concept of “baby food” for 
more nourishment and less self-
hatred for subjecting myself to 
diet purgatory. I allowed myself 
a daily intake of mushy foods 
in tandem with baby food. I 
justified my oatmeal order by 
its identifiable mushiness.

I ate a few containers of baby 

food later in the day, but Friday 
eventually resulted in a diet 
flop. (I came to The Michigan 
Daily’s Editor in Chief election 
night. I saw the pizza. I ate the 
pizza.)

Saturday

Successful Saturday! After 

two meals of baby food, I was 
feeling 
good 
(but 
hungry) 

and ready for a healthy finale. 
My parents were in town for 
the game and treated me to a 
dinner of French onion soup, 
seared tuna and seaweed salad 
at Weber’s hotel. The hotel was 
even hosting a bar mitzvah just 
begging to be crashed. Seeing 
as approximately half my food 
intake had probably knocked 
me down a few years, I felt 
juvenile and ready to jump up 
and down on the dance floor. 
I didn’t, solely out of mother’s 
disdain.

Sunday

Surrender Sunday! I fully 

realized 
my 
stupidity 
for 

attempting to swap two daily 
meals for baby food and vowed 
to focus on my health. Even 
on 
successful 
days, 
I 
was 

ravenously hungry. I silently 
praised 
Witherspoon 
and 

Aniston for their strong-willed 
dieting habits as I scraped a 
banana container. 

That night, I ate seaweed 

and sushi and felt alive for the 
first time in a while — from the 
food and the sweet freedom 
of releasing myself from the 
shackles and unsophisticated 
palate fare of baby food.

Conclusion:

Though I couldn’t withstand 

a week of ingesting baby food, 
by spotlighting my diet and 
questioning my food choices more 
than usual, I actually learned a 
fucking lot about myself! In most 
respects, babies do indeed appear 
to live the dream, but their food 
is only tasty in small doses and 
simply trash when overkilled. 
After alternating between mush 
and puree, I would only willingly 
return to the infant stage if I had 
both the sophisticated palate and 
mastication mechanisms I do 
now, paired with the cognitive 
abilities to appreciate it all. I’ll 
surely never be a diet-endorsing 
celebrity, but after removing 
myself from the day-to-day, I’m 
content with my brunching, 
Blank Slate visits and brother 
lunch dates. 

BABY FOOD
From Page 1B

“Caro tells 

herself lies to 

make up for her 

missteps.”

L

ast week, The Wall 
Street Journal published 
an article with the head-

line “The Potential Cardiac 
Dangers of Extreme Exercise,” 
which 
stopped 
the 
hearts 
of every 
athlete 
read-
ing the 
page. The 
article 
describes 
findings 
from a 
British study presented to the 
European Society of Cardiol-
ogy last August, which tested 
169 veteran competitive endur-
ance athletes against a control 
group of 171 relatively sed-
entary adults, both free from 
cardiovascular risk factors, to 
highlight how exercise benefits 
(or harms) our hearts.

Indeed, their results supported 

our “Let’s Move!” mentality: Com-
pared to sedentary adults, commit-
ted athletes who ran a maximum 
of 35 miles a week had lower levels 
of coronary artery calcium — the 
plaque that blocks arteries — and 
were less likely to suffer from 
heart attacks and strokes.

But when athletes ran over 35 

miles per week, something weird 
happened. “Athletes who ran or 
cycled beyond that threshold were 
found to harbor higher levels of 
coronary artery calcium than did 
the control group,” the article said. 
Basically, a dedicated runner who 
logged 50 miles a week had the 
same — or worse — heart health 
than a couch potato.

Not so fast. There was another 

factor tested in the study: the inten-
sity of exercise. Results found that 
the slowest men and women had 
significantly lower levels of plaque 
than the sedentary group, which 
is consistent with the American 
Heart 
Association’s 
statement: 

“Walking briskly can lower your 
risk of high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol and diabetes as much 
as running.” Subjects who regular-

ly walked or jogged had healthier 
hearts than those who didn’t. Ath-
letes who trained at higher inten-
sities, however, had more ominous 
results. As women’s training speed 
increased, their plaque levels rose; 
still, they remained healthier than 
the sedentary group.

But the men who exercised 

the most at the highest intensi-
ties — think marathon studs like 
2014 Boston Marathon Cham-
pion Meb Keflezighi — lit up with 
red flags. Their levels of plaque, 
results showed, were significant-
ly higher than sedentary men. 
Why? Doctors cite “inflamma-
tion, changes in the structure of 
the heart or an excess secretion 
of certain proteins or hormones,” 
as potential causes.

The findings are unsettling, 

especially as a committed distance 
runner with a family history of 
heart problems. It makes me ques-
tion my own father’s cardiac inci-
dent, almost 30 years ago. A former 
varsity cross country runner at 
Albion College, my father had a 
sudden heart attack at 26 years old. 
He was young and physically fit, 
fresh out of law school, filling up 
his gas tank when it happened. He 
drove himself to the closest hospi-
tal, hand clamped to his chest — he 
said the pain was excruciating, but 
he’d run enough painful races to 
not be too alarmed.

His doctors blamed genetics 

and diet: his mother had cardio-
vascular problems; he’d eaten too 
many Big Macs. It was the early 
’90s, the era of Jane Fonda fitness 
tapes and jogging, athletes buoyed 
by the running boom of the ’70s. 
Getting too much exercise was 
never a concern. Should they have 
worried then?

Maybe now, instead of warn-

ing 
against 
over-exercising, 

researchers 
should 
consider: 

What makes endurance athletes 
go the distances they do, if not for 
health reasons?

School of Nursing Junior Alex 

Fauer, President of the U-M Tri-
athlon Club, has completed the 
holy grail of endurance competi-
tions — an Ironman Triathlon, 
which begins with a 2.4-mile 

swim, a 112-mile bike and finishes 
with 26.2-mile run (i.e. marathon). 
The races typically start at 7 a.m. 
and pack up at midnight, leav-
ing participants 17 hours to finish 
140.6 miles. It’s one of the longest, 
most grueling physical tests on the 
planet — one that even seasoned 
marathoners are wary of, for its 
brutal toll on the body.

I asked Fauer his opinion on 

potential health risks of too much 
exercise.

“The risk of fatigue from over-

training and overuse injuries are 
already on athletes’ radars. So 
where do we go from this?” Fauer 
said. “Are these athletes safe? I 
think before athletes are scared 
and stop training, they should con-
sider their current health and talk 
with physicians about monitoring 
the possibility of illness.”

He continued, “Personally, I 

think if an athlete has a passion 
for long distance training, he 
should embark on whatever jour-
ney that he feels he can achieve. I 
used this philosophy to motivate 
my training for my first Ironman 
last August.”

What the study doesn’t show: 

the cost of restricting passion. On 
principle, I ignore people who tell 
me what I love is unhealthy. In the 
words of Jonathan Beverly, editor 
in chief of Running Times Maga-
zine, “Whether or not running 
extends your life is irrelevant. We 
run not because it might make life 
longer, but because it makes life 
better — because we love how it 
makes us feel. And because we love 
it, we do it as much as our bodies 
allow. Forget moderation.”

Do I think running a steady 50 

miles per week makes me health-
ier than someone who jogs an 
easy 20? No.

Am I a better person because 

I run? Yes, absolutely. I feel more 
alive, accomplished, sound in my 
mind and body when I go far and 
fast. And if something must take a 
toll on my health, I want my vice to 
be miles.

RC faculty to read 
original work at EQ

EVENT PREVIEW

By NATALIE ZAK

For The Daily

“Those 
who 
cannot 
do, 

teach.” Whoever is guilty of 
construing 
this 
inaccurate 

condescension 
evidently 
never 
encountered 
a 
faculty 

member of the 
University’s 
Residential 
College.

The 
talent 

and experience 
offered 
by 

members 
of 

the Residential 
College faculty 
often 
goes 

unnoticed by the large student 
body that rests outside of its 
doors. 
Authors, 
poets 
and 

artists all lie within the college, 
and to small classes of lucky 
students, they impart their 
talent and wisdom. Among 
these maestros of art are author 
Robert James Russell, author 
and poet Laura Kasischke and 
Ken Mikolowski, a poet and 
retired professor of 38 years — 
all of whom will be performing 
in the RC’s second annual 
“Friday Night’s Alright for 
Reading” this Friday.

Offering selections from their 

past and present work, these 
writers and other members of 
the star-studded faculty will 
perform their award-winning 
poems and short stories. Russell 
and 
faculty 
member 
Laura 

Thomas devised the event last 
winter during Russell’s first 
year working at the University 

to 
display 
the 
talent 
and 

dedication overflowing from 
the RC.

Russell, 
author 
of 
two 

novellas and a collection of 
short stories, is an avid traveler 
who 
addresses 
multifarious 

places and ideas. From settings 
of eerie Japanese forests to the 
19th century West, Russell’s 
repertoire reflects his craftful 
ability to explore subjects he is 
not directly familiar with, but 
can construct nonetheless.

“I like relationships; I like 

space; I like landscape and I 
really like writing about how 
those things intersect; how 
our relationships are formed 
based on the space around us, 
how it informs who we are … 
how every place has its unique 
stories and mythologies to tell 
and how that makes us who we 
are based on where we grew 
up.”

Poetry for Kasischke, on 

the other hand, reflects her 
personal experiences. Though 
she 
incorporates 
tales 
of 

treachery, mystery and murder 
into 
her 
novels, 
Kasischke 

focuses on roots of a more 
intimate nature in her poetry. 
Gifted with the ability to 

write both fiction and poetry, 
she elaborated on the inverse 
processes for writing both.

“I write poetry and I write 

fiction and it’s two totally 
different processes. When I 
write fiction, it’s pretty much 
discipline … When I write 
poetry, it’s because I’ve had 
an idea for a while and finally 
found time to just be alone. I 
can work on a novel for about 
a half hour and then put it 
away; it could take years but I 
can handle that. With a poem, 
nothing is going to interrupt it 
or I’m not even going to try.”

However, after 38 years at 

the University and a lifetime 
of writing poetry, Mikolowski 
has the most experience to 
impart on young aspiring poets. 
Though he kept his writing 
and teaching separate during 
his time at the University, his 
abstract process for finding 
ideas 
and 
meditating 
on 

them before expressing them 
is reflected in his previous 
student Kasischke’s process.

“I walk around and I try to 

not ignore things. I try to pay 
attention. 
When 
something 

speaks to me, I listen. When 
something 
sounds 
right, 
I 

listen, and I go home and 
write it down. I try to convey 
thoughts about my own life 
and my own impending death. 
Everybody hates talking about 
that, but that’s what I try to 
connect in my poetry, and I find 
them pretty funny.”

A witness and partaker in 

the artistic revolution that 
occurred in Detroit in the 
’60s and ’70s, Mikolowski is 
aligned 
with 
contemporary 

poets of that age including 
Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman 
and Alice Notley. As a reaction 
to the insurgencies and riots 
that occurred in the urban 
center, the Artist’s Workshop, 
a run down apartment space 
dedicated to presenting art from 
individuals around the city, and 
Mikolowski’s Alternative Press 
were formed.

Run out of their basement, 

Mikolowski 
and 
his 
wife 

Ann published contemporary 
poetry from artists around 
Detroit on a printing press 
run and kept by the couple. 
To 
this 
day, 
Mikolowski 

finds himself channeling the 
innovative spirit that existed in 

reactionary Detroit by writing 
unconventional poetry. In his 
new collection “That That,” for 
instance, the longest poem is a 
mere three lines long.

One common theme remains 

between 
these 
acclaimed 

writers: Michigan. Although it 
may not have been the driving 
influence for most of their 
works, and could even exist 
entirely separately of what they 
write, these writers have had 
the University as the backdrop 
to their lives for as long as they 
have been in Ann Arbor. 

Though Russell, Kasischke 

and Maslowski all admit the 
themes 
invoked 
into 
their 

writing were kept separate 
from 
their 
teaching, 
they 

are still inspired by the trial 
and 
errors 
their 
fledgling 

writers endure in class. Being 
exposed to the work of young 
hopefuls 
admittedly 
pushes 

Russell to strive to be a better 
writer, and Kasischke, who 
participates in free writes with 
her students, immerses herself 
in the experience. It was in this 

classroom setting, in fact, that 
she began her first full-length 
novel.

Perhaps Mikolowski presents 

the most curious intersection 
of teaching and writing. Rather 
than let the lines between his 
University and writing life 
overlap, he kept them distinctly 
separate, and never let his 
poetic success define what 
writing meant for his students.

“I did not teach people how 

to write. How to write poetry 
is something I don’t even know, 
how do you write poetry? I 
taught them to want to write 
poetry.”

To have acclaimed writers 

and 
poets 
as 
teachers 
is 

humanizing, 
especially 
in 

a community of liberal arts 
students all striving to one day 
be recognized for a creative 
work. Dreams do not appear 
presumptuous or implausible 
or 
even 
irrational 
when 

encouraged by individuals who 
were once in the same exact 
position of hoping, wishing and 
wanting as a young adult.

Cigarette-smoking, 
long-haired youth 
love this Canadian

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

I am standing. I am sweating. 

Surrounded 
by 
cigarette-

smoking, 
long-haired 
youth, 

the crowd sloshes around me 
closer and closer. The opening 
acts, The Courtneys and Alex 
Calder, 
prompt 
appreciative 

head bobbing and shivers of 
excitement 
throughout 
the 

audience. With each strum 
of the guitar or beat of the 
drum the crowd seems to inch 
forward, aiming for the closest 
possible point in space to the 
night’s main attraction — Mac 
DeMarco. As the lights finally 
dim and Mac makes his way 
onto the small stage, the energy 
of the crowd erupts. Hands, 
drinks and cheers are thrust 
into 
the 
air, 
unreservedly 

welcoming the goofy Canadian 
artist. He begins to play. I am 
standing, I am sweating and I 
am happy.

***

Mac DeMarco’s sound is 

jangly 
and 
unconventional 

and funny — just like his 
performance at The Crofoot in 
Pontiac, Mich. on Sunday night. 
Opening with “The Way You’d 
Love Her,” DeMarco had the 
crowd hooked from the first 
wavy vibration of his guitar. 
He touched on fan favorites 
like “Salad Days,” “Chamber of 
Reflection” and “Let Her Go” all 
while maintaining an off-the-
cuff performance style. True to 
form, DeMarco would scream, 
use funny voices and improvise 
with his band throughout the 
set. The band members found 
themselves in various states of 

Mac Demarco is our 
holy lord and savior

composition during the 17-song 
performance. Members of The 
Courtneys and Alex Calder 
backed DeMarco on different 
instruments; a few even flung 
themselves, 
per 
DeMarco’s 

nudging instruction, into the 
outstretched 
hands 
of 
the 

crowd to surf over the fans for 
an entire song.

DeMarco also stepped out of 

his generally swirling realm of 
musicality, covering “Reelin’ 
In The Years” by Steely Dan 
and 
“Enter 
Sandman” 
by 

Metallica. The latter, which 
constituted 
the 
encore, 

spanned ten-plus minutes and 
consisted of absolute insanity. 
“Enter Sandman” in and of 
itself is intense — heavily 
bass and percussion driven 
instrumentation 
coated 
in 

angry vocals. By this point 
in the show DeMarco, some 
of his bandmates and many 
members of the crowd were 
shirtless, sweaty visions of 
the people they were pre-gig. 

DeMarco was drinking on stage 
and screaming to the music. 
A new crowd-surfing fan was 
popping up every minute or 
so. There was a quasi-mosh pit 
going strong and band members 
were eagerly playing off of each 
other.

Fans may have initially been 

drawn in by DeMarco’s laid-
back jangle sound, but what 
really makes him a great artist 
is his sense of self. As proven on 
Sunday night, DeMarco knows 
exactly who he is and what his 
art means to himself and to 
others. On the surface level, 
his performance was relaxed 
and 
spontaneous 
and 
fun. 

But in looking a little closer, 
it is clear that DeMarco lives 
and breathes his profession, 
that his performances are an 
extension of himself rather 
than a meticulously calculated 
production. He was on fire. The 
peak of his inferno occurred 
when he threw himself into the 
audience and crowd surfed his 

way to the edge of the crowd, 
climbed a support pole to the 
upper balcony and shuffled 
along the railing to meet the 
fans on the upper level. He then 
cheekily motioned to the mass 
below then jumped back into 
their waiting hands and hitched 
a ride to the stage.

DeMarco 
and 
his 
band’s 

performance was one of the 
most authentic and welcoming 
shows I have ever experienced. 
He never made the audience 
feel inferior, like he was the 
almighty artist and we were the 
unworthy fans. He was a young 
person hanging out with his 
friends and making music — a 
sentiment most youth can relate 
to in some shape or form. He did 
not concern himself with his 
procured image as an artist or 
his perfection in performance. 
He was a real person. And from 
what I saw on Sunday night, 
Mac DeMarco is exactly the 
kind of person I look forward to 
seeing again in the future.
