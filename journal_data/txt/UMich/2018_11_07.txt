Democratic candidate Gretchen Whitmer elected governor
BUILDING BRIDGES

A 

s the midterm election 
results rolled in late 
Tuesday night, guests 
filled the Sound Board 

Theater at the MotorCity Casino 
Hotel in Detroit for the Michigan 
Democratic Party’s election watch 
night. 
As 
Michigan 
Democrat 

winners 
were 
called, 
they 

addressed an enthusiastic audience 

with victory speeches.

First to be announced were 

U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint, and 
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann 
Arbor. The two took the stage in 
anticipation of the winners soon to 
be announced.

“We’re excited because people 

are not going to worry about 
protecting the Great Lakes, we’re 

going to have a Governor that 
makes sure to protect our water … 
We’re going to make sure that we fix 
the damn roads … and we’re going 
to work hard to make sure every 
American has affordable quality 
healthcare,” Dingell said. “Tonight 
you can party and tomorrow we 
roll up our sleeves and work hard to 
deliver for the people of Michigan 

who voted for us.”

Kildee 
then 
announced 
the 

victory of Haley Stevens in the 11th 
Congressional District. Following a 
period while votes were still being 
counted, 
Lieutenant 
Governor-

elect Garlin Gilchrist was the next 
Democrat announced as victorious. 
He took to the stage and spoke 
on his excitement for the state of 

Michigan as well as his gratitude 
for Michigan voters.
“We stand on this stage upon the 

shoulders of giants who had a vision 
that went beyond generations, and 
it’s our generation’s responsibility 
to live up to that vision to have 
our 
imaginations 
exceed 
our 

expectations,” Gilchrist said. “Tonight 
is a statement that we can accomplish

anything we set our hearts to … 
And if history has not yet been 
made then we can make it.”

Gilchrist then introduced 

Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, 
winner of the governor’s race.

“I am so excited about what 

the state of Michigan is doing 
right now,” Gilchrist said. 
“And the only thing I might 
be more excited about is the 
woman who’s going be the next 
governor and that’s Gretchen 
Whitmer.”

Whitmer 
defeated 

Republican 
candidate 
Bill 

Schuette, Michigan attorney 
general, and succeeds term-
limited 
Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder. 

The 
race 
was 
called 
by 

the Associated Press at about 
10 p.m. with about half of 
Michigan’s polls reporting. At 
that point, Whitmer led with 
53.8 percent of the vote over 
43.3 percent for Schuette.

“I am incredibly, incredibly 

humbled that you put your 
trust in me to be your next 
governor,” 
Whitmer 
said. 

“Early results appear to be a 
record turnout, so this victory 
belongs to you. We may have 
all gone to the polls for very 
different reasons, but today 
we as Michiganders came 

out because we all love this 
state and because we want a 
Michigan that works for every 
one of us.”

She 
then 
described 
her 

campaign’s logo: the Mackinac 
Bridge. 
She 
explained 
the 

bridge, which is the longest 
suspension 
bridge 
in 
the 

Western Hemisphere, opened 
61 years ago but was built 
during a time of divided 
government.

“A lot of people didn’t think 

they’d ever come together 
to build that bridge… and 
yet 
Michiganders 
worked 

together,” Whitmer said. “We 
built a bridge that brought us 
together 
and 
strengthened 

our economy. And at a 
time where we see too 
many people who want 
to divide us through 
building walls, I think 
we in Michigan need 
to get back to building 
bridges.”

Whitmer voiced to a 

chanting and energized 
crowd 
her 
prospects 

for the future. After 22 
months of campaigning, 
she explained, she is 
ready “to hit the ground 
running.”

“To 
the 
people 
of 

this 
great 
state, 
the 

work ahead will not be 
easy… 
but 
no 
matter 

the challenge I want 
you to know I will be a 
governor who works for 
everyone in this state,” 
Whitmer 
said. 
“For 

those who voted for me 
and those who didn’t, 
a governor who brings 
people together to solve 
problems, 
a 
governor 

who always puts you, 
the people, first. Thank 
you Michigan, let’s build 

some bridges.”

Back on campus, student 

political groups had mixed 
reactions to election night 
results. 
LSA 
sophomore 

Dylan Berger, president of 
the University’s chapter of 
College Republicans, said he 
was disappointed by Schuette 
losing. He said the results were 
not indicative of a “blue wave,” 
and he hopes Whitmer proves 
his concerns with her platform 
wrong.

“It was very unfortunate 

that 
Bill 
Schuette 
lost,” 

Berger said. “He ran a solid 
campaign, and I really think 
that 
Michiganders 
will 

regret voting for Gretchen 
Whitmer, but I’ll be praying 
for Gretchen Whitmer tonight. 
I’ll be praying that she does a 
fantastic job for our state, and 
I certainly hope I was wrong 
in everything that I said 
about her. I hope she does a 
 

great job, but I’m certainly 
concerned.”

Public Policy junior Katie 

Kelly, 
Communications 

Director for College Democrats 
said she is excited about the 
hard work College Democrats 
put 
into 
getting 
Whitmer 

elected. After the upset in the 
2016 election, Kelly said she 
didn’t want to trust the polls, 
but they ultimately turned out 
in her favor.

“I believe she is going to be 

a voice for all of Michigan,” 
Kelly said. “She has made it 
very clear by all the times she 
has come to campus that she is 
going to be a voice for students, 
she’s going to be a voice for 
working families, she’s going 
to be a voice for education, 
she’s been heavily involved in 
public schools in our state. All 
around, I think she’s going to 
be a voice for Michigan.”

RESULTS

DEBBIE STABENOW

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., was 

re-elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating 
Trump-backed 
Republican 
John 
James. 

Stabenow was originally elected to the 
U.S. Senate in 2000 as Michigan’s first 
female senator after serving two terms in 
the U.S. House of Representatives. This 
will be her fourth term in the Senate.

Stabenow votes consistently with the 

Democratic 
party 
in 
the 
Senate, 
and 

rooted her campaign around key issues 
of 
protecting 
veterans, 
lowering 
costs 

of prescription drugs, increasing skills 
training and protecting the Great Lakes.

Stabenow 
visited 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan campus in September to rally 
the student vote, along with U.S. Rep. Joe 
Kennedy III, D-Mass., U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
and 
other 
Michigan 

politicians, discussing issues pertinent to 
Michigan students, such as clean water, the 
Great Lakes, net neutrality and college debt.

She held another Get Out the Vote 

rally on campus the eve of Election Day, 
encouraging students to vote ethically.

“We 
are 
committed 
to 
a 
country 

that reflects the right values, and we 
reject what has been spewing out of 
the 
White 
House,” 
Stabenow 
said.

Debbie Dingell was re-elected as the 

U.S. representative for Michigan’s 12th 
District after running unopposed. This 
will be Dingell’s second term, succeeding 
her husband John Dingell, the longest-
serving U.S. representative in history. 

In the U.S. House of Representatives, 

Dingell serves on the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce and as a senior 
whip. Her main issues of focus include 
the auto industry, health care for all, 
the Great Lakes and the environment. 

Dingell visited campus several times 

over the semester to rally the student 

vote, appearing alongside Sen. Debbie 
Stabenow, 
D-Mich., 
Democratic 

gubernatorial 
candidate 
Gretchen 

Whitmer and Dana Nessel, Democratic 
candidate for Michigan attorney general, 
among others. At a rally in October, she 
extended a call to action to students. 

“We cannot let (Republicans) win, 

and 
democracy 
is 
under 
attack,” 

Dingell said. “We need everybody 
across the state to roll up their sleeves, 
to volunteer … Let’s take America 
back to where it’s supposed to be.

Gretchen Whitmer Fast Facts

Whitmer’s election breaks the Republican 

trifecta of Michigan government, with 
the GOP having maintained control of the 
Michigan governorship, state House of 
Representatives, and state Senate since 2010, 
and signals a shift in voter attitudes since 
the state elected President Trump in 2016.

On the campaign trail, Whitmer secured 

the endorsements of big Democratic 
politicians such as former President Barack 
Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, and 

U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., 
Gary Peters, D-Mich., Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. 
She campaigned on expanding health care 
coverage and lowering costs, improving 
the education system, increasing skills 
training so people can secure higher-
wage jobs and “fixing the damn roads.”

Whitmer held a rally alongside Sen. 

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., U.S. Representative 
Debbie Dingell, and Michigan Attorney 

General candidate Dana Nessel at the 
University of Michigan in October to 
 

mobilize 
the 
student 
vote.

“In a political environment where it is 

easy to feel demoralized, easy to feel like it 
doesn’t matter, easy to feel angry about what 
we see every day as breaking news,” Whitmer 
said. “We know we have an opportunity 
in 18 days to show the world what kind 
of leadership we think we deserve.”

In a political environment 

where it is easy to feel 

demoralized, easy to feel 
like it doesn’t matter, easy 
to feel angry about what we 

see every day as breaking 
news...we know we have an 

opportunity...


I’m still in awe of Aida 

Cuevas’s performance of her 
album Totalmente Juan Gabriel 
last Friday night. 

Cuevas is a powerhouse 

performer with phenomenal 
vocals. She has been in the 
music 
industry 
for 
over 

40 years, winning both a 
Grammy and a Latin Grammy 
award. Not only is Cuevas 
an 
incredible 
singer, 
but 

she also has a strong stage 
presence, holding herself with 
tremendous confidence and 
grace. Totalmente Juan Gabriel 
is a tribute to her friend and 
mentor Juan Gabriel, who 

passed away in 2016. 

From 
the 
second 
her 

mariachi 
band, 
Mariachi 

Juvenil 
Tecalitlán, 
entered 

the stage, the audience went 
wild. I could feel the energy 
explode with their opening 
song, and their enthusiasm was 
infectious. Even though I didn’t 
know any of the words and don’t 
understand Spanish well, the 
upbeat tone of the music spoke 
for itself. 

Next to me, in front of me and 

behind me, people were dancing 
in their seats and singing along. 
Towards the end of the night, 
the audience sang so loudly that 
Cuevas — with a huge, shocked 
smile on her face — decided to 
listen instead of sing. She looked 
proud to have an audience so 

engaged, and for others like 
myself who didn’t know the 
lyrics, it was incredible to 
witness everyone else’s passion. 

Throughout 
the 
night, 
it 

became clear that Cuevas meant 
a lot to many of the audience 
members. I couldn’t catch what 
Cuevas was saying in between 
songs in Spanish, but every 
time she talked the audience 
members 
around 
me 
were 

silent, as if savoring her every 
last word. I began to realize that 
for many people, Cuevas was 
the connection to their culture 
and 
home 
countries. 
Many 

parents were there with their 
children, sharing an important 
part of their identities through 
Cuevas’s voice. 

The majority of her songs 

were in traditional mariachi 
style, with energetic beats and a 
general sentiment of happiness. 
There was one slow song where 
the lights dimmed and Cuevas 
poured her soul into the singing, 
but it wasn’t out of place, instead 
reminding us that even when we 
celebrate one’s life, we may feel 
melancholic on the journey of 
accepting their passing. 

One of my favorite parts was 

when members of Mariachi 
Juvenil Tecalitlán band had 
solos. They built off of each 
other, and each instrument 
got its shining moment. The 
band members were overjoyed 
with 
our 
reactions, 
which 

made it all the more exciting 
to not just listen, but to watch 
them perform with the same 
enthusiasm as Cuevas. 

The audience was so thrilled 

with the show that even after 
Cuevas said goodbye and left 
the stage, they chanted loudly 
for an encore, which caused 
her to return for one final 
performance. It was a special 
moment as Cuevas discussed 
how much it meant for her to 
tour in North America and 
share her music. This show 
also fell during Día de Muertos 
(Day of the Dead) — a Mexican 
holiday celebrating friends and 
family who have passed away 
— making the tribute to Juan 
Gabriel all the more powerful. 

Cuevas 
is 
sometimes 

compared to Aretha Franklin, 
and I now understand why. 
With her impressive vocal range 
and ability to project emotion so 
clearly in her voice, Cuevas is a 
distinctive artist and important 
figure in Mexican music. And 
beyond that, she’s an icon who 
offers Latinx Americans the 
chance to reconnect to the 
music of their roots.

SMTD alum Caleb Foote 
on ‘The Kids Are Alright’

ABC’s newest family sitcom 

“The Kids Are Alright” is already 
making waves as one of fall’s best 
new series. Set in suburban Los 
Angeles during the early ’70s, 
the story follows the Clearys, 
a 
dysfunctional, 
testosterone-

filled 
Irish-Catholic 
household 

navigating a politically divisive era 
amid sibling rivalries and working-
class struggles.

Though the show dedicates 

most of its time to lonesome 
middle child Timmy (Jack Gore, 
“Billions”), “The Kids Are Alright” 
deftly 
fleshes 
out 
distinctive 

personalities within the rest of 
the Cleary family, including the 
endearingly goofy Eddie, played by 
University alum Caleb Foote.

As an acting major at the 

University, 
Foote 
performed 

in 
several 
student 
theater 

productions, including “Henry IV, 
Part 1.” In the summer of 2015, he 
participated in the Educational 
Theater Company, an on-campus 
group 
that 
incorporates 

performance 
through 
an 

interactive, educational lens in 
an effort to enlighten incoming 
freshmen about the many social, 
academic and personal issues they 
might encounter during college.

After receiving a Bachelor of 

Fine Arts degree in 2016, Foote 
continued to perform onstage in 
a variety of plays, including “Zoot 
Suit” at the Mark Taper Forum 
in Los Angeles and “Hansel and 
Gretel Blue Grass.” In 2017, he 
was given the San Diego Theatre 
Critics Circle Craig Noel Award for 
Outstanding Male Performance 

for his lead role in “Hand to God.” 
From there, Foote made his way 
onto television, guest starring in 
FX’s “American Horror Story: 
Cult” and “American Crime Story: 
The 
Assassination 
of 
Gianni 

Versace.”

In a recent phone interview 

with The Daily, Foote discussed his 
positive undergraduate experience 
at the University, the perks of being 
a regular player on a network show 
and the differences between acting 
onscreen and acting onstage.

The Michigan Daily: How did 

your education at Michigan shape 
your understanding of acting and 
performing for the camera?

Caleb 
Foote: 
It 
greatly 

shaped it. I can take back all 
my 
professional 
successes 
to 

my education and degree at the 
University of Michigan. In 2016, 
the year I graduated, we had a 
senior showcase and it was the 
first 
school-produced 
senior 

showcase. You do two scenes, 
typically contrasting scenes, and 
you do them in New York and Los 
Angeles and Chicago for industry 
professionals and a bunch of 
people we cold-called — agents and 
managers and casting directors, 
trying to get them to show up with 
the hopes that they would sign us. I 
was fortunate enough to get some 
really cool bites in Los Angeles. I 
got my agent and manager from 
my showcase, and they’re the 
agent and manager I have now. 
Every single professional gig from 
a non-union play, which led to a 
union play, which led to a small 
part on a TV show, which led to 
an important part on a TV show, 
which led to a series regular on the 
ABC network... I can directly trace 
it from the University of Michigan, 

the showcase and the class I took 
for the showcase.

To get into the acting school, 

there’s a lot of natural talent that 
you have to have. You have to be 
good enough to be accepted by the 
faculty. From the early stages of 
the program, you get out of your 
old high school acting habits and 
the things that got you there. From 
there, you expand on what makes 
you unique. That’s what being an 
upperclassman is like; you take 
what you’re really good at, you 
mold it and you challenge yourself 
with the things you aren’t so good 
at. The acting school is just this 
great platform for development 
and risk-taking. If you go in there 
and do something totally stupid, it’s 
not like your peer that’s watching 
you is a casting director that will 
never want to see you again. That 
is where you take those risks, as 
cheesy as that sounds.

TMD: In addition to TV, you’ve 

performed on stage both during 
your time at Michigan and after 
graduating. What have you found 
to be different between acting for 
the screen versus acting on stage?

CF: The payday (laughs). The 

pay is way different for the camera 
because once it’s on camera, it’s 
kind of immortalized forever in 
the history books of television. For 
theater, you spend a month and a 
half, two months if you’re super 
lucky, but you have this extended 
period of time to memorize, to 
rehearse, to get everything set in 
stone. It’s this really great creative 
process and by the end of it, you 
have all of this time to prep and be 
show-ready, which is brilliant. But 
the difference between theater and 
film and television is that with film 
and television, the turnaround is

so fast. You’re shooting an episode 
a week. You’re doing an episode in 
five work days. You have a weekend 
to memorize and when you walk 
on set, you have to be totally off-
book. You basically read it with 
the director and then you kind of 
walk it through, map out whatever 
idea you have or the director has. 
Theater would be like the actor’s 
medium, and television is like the 
writer’s medium. It’s more of like 
what you bring in your impulses, 
and then the director makes his or 
her adjustments and there’s not so 
much of a long process of deciding 
on what should I do and mapping 
out specific blocking.

With theater, you have so long 

to rehearse and to get into your 
character and to stay in it for 
the two-and-a-half hours you’re 
doing the show. For television, it’s 
everything that’s in that box of 
the camera and you’re just doing 
the writers justice and it’s really 
just you at home memorizing and 
trying to understand the joke, 
so that when you walk in on set, 
you’re ready to just do it because 
you gotta knock that out and then 
you have to do two more scenes 
after that.

TMD: “The Kids Are Alright” 

centers a lot around dysfunctional 
family dynamics. What was your 
experience like working with such 
a large ensemble of actors of all 
different ages?

CF: It’s my first time that I’m 

not the youngest person on set. It’s 
great. We’re working with these 
vets Michael Cudlitz and Mary 
McCormack, these people that 
have been in the game for so long. 
You learn that there are so many 
different approaches to the game. 
Like, their process of learning 
the material and then bringing it 
forward to the director and crew, it 
totally varies. And these kid actors 
we’re working with are brilliant. 
There’s so many of them. The only 
downfall to working with these 
kid actors is that they have to go 
to school because you just want to 
hang out with them all the time. 
Being one of the older boys of the 
show, myself and my older bro, 
we get to tackle the young adult 
topics. Meanwhile, the kids get 
to tackle all the mischief, ruffian, 
getting-into-the-neighbors-yard-
and-stealing-a-dog business, and 
the mom and dad can handle 
the housekeeping and then later, 
bigger family mom-and-dad issues.

TMD: Your character Eddie is 

the second-oldest of seven kids. 
How do you think he stands out 
among his siblings?

CF: That’s funny you say that. 

The show was written as a pilot 
and it was based on (“The Kids 
Are Alright” creator and narrator) 
Tim Doyle’s life. A bunch of it is 
pretty close to home and realistic 

to what happened in his childhood. 
The pilot is so fast, and it’s a little 
bit overwhelming and it’s kind of 
hard to distinguish characters. 
But as the show progresses, 
because there are 10 characters, 
in every single scene there are 
10 opportunities to make a joke 
and (our writing team) does such 
a brilliant job of distinguishing 
each character. Eddie specifically 
is so fun to play because he’s this 
impulsive, 
big-hearted... 
total 

goofball. When (the eldest brother) 
Lawrence goes to the seminary, 
(Eddie) kind of takes the role of 
the oldest brother, so you’ll see 
him carrying the baby and stuff. 
But he’s just this light-hearted 
guy who has a girlfriend, and it’s 
the first time anyone in the Cleary 
household has brought a girl home. 
Growing up in a household of all 
boys, they’re kind of unfamiliar 
with how to act around a girl and 
everyone has their input on how 
to be a boyfriend and how to be in 
a relationship and that results in 
some pretty great comedy.

TMD: Do you have any brothers 

or siblings?

CF: Yeah! I grew up in a Roman-

Catholic home, basically Irish-
Catholic. I have three brothers.

TMD: Did your upbringing 

inspire your performance at all?

CF: Even though I didn’t grow 

up in the ’70s, I can still relate 
to the Catholic upbringing with 
all the boys and the chaos and 
Mom trying to get everyone ready 
before Sunday mass and the big 
breakfasts and the “you’re on your 
own, take care of yourself because 
if you don’t do it yourself, someone 
else is gonna eat that drumstick.” 
I’m the second-youngest, third-
oldest boy in my real family. It kind 
of takes me back to being a younger 
guy, which is brilliant because who 
doesn’t want to be young?

TMD: How do you get into 

character and immerse yourself in 
your role?

CF: This is my first time 

reporting to a job in film and 
television like it’s a day job, like 
clocking in and out every single 
day for an extended period of 
time. Something with that is like, 
you want to go in every single day 
being like, “I’m gonna do my best 
work.” But you can’t control what’s 
happening to you that day and 
especially because this is going 
on for a long period of time, every 
single scene can’t be an Emmy-
award-winning scene. Such a big 
part of doing a series regular job 
and shooting four scenes a day and 
then the next day shooting five 
scenes and the next day shooting 
one scene is that you can’t have that 
much weight on you. And after you 
do a scene, even if it wasn’t your 
greatest performance, you kind of 
just gotta let it go and look forward 

and look ahead to your next one. 
You can’t beat yourself up over the 
things you can’t control. Some days, 
you’re gonna totally knock it out 
the park, and the writers are gonna 
give you this brilliant joke and you 
get to be on this great location with 
a trash can. And then on another 
day, you’re gonna be a wallflower 
and you’re gonna have one line and 
you’re gonna feel weird about that 
line but you can’t let that bring you 
down because that’s the beauty 
of being on an ensemble project. 
There are so many people to rely 
on. It’s like a team sport. I believe 
it’s a winning team.

TMD: This wasn’t your first 

rodeo on TV. Your other credits 
include FX’s “American Horror 
Story” and “American Crime 
Story: The Assassination of Gianni 
Versace,” both of which were 
created by Ryan Murphy. How 
different was your experience 
working on a cable drama from 
working on a network comedy?

CF: I can’t get killed off at this 

show (laughs). In all the other 
ones, I was always at risk. Every 
single day is the best day of work. 
That’s why we do it. But with that, 
you’ll get a new script every Friday 
and when you get that new script 
working on the cable shows, you 
sift through the script to see if you 
have any lines, to see where your 
character comes up. It’s so much 
fun, but there’s always that chance 
that your character gets killed off. 
That happened to me in “American 
Horror Story.” I was three episodes 
deep, and I was sifting through (the 
script) and I was like, “Heck yes! So 
fun, so fun.” And I made all these 
friends. And then my character, 
boom, my character gets gunned 
down, four gunshots to the chest. 
All my buds got to keep going on 
and I was like, “Why? Why me?!” 
This is my first job where they can’t 
kill me.

TMD: As the season continues, 

what can viewers expect to see 
from your character and the rest of 
the Cleary household?

CF: A lot of heart from the whole 

family. Our writing room is pretty 
insane and our creative team has 
a really great track record. It’s not 
like this is their big break. They’ve 
been making TV for a while and 
really good TV, so we’re in really 
good hands. Right now, we won’t 
be relying on principal office 
visits because we have such a big 
cast that as the episodes progress, 
our writing team has been able 
to distinguish and expand on the 
characters and make them bigger 
and more specific. I have just so 
much love for our writing team. 
You’re gonna see a lot more Eddie, 
I’ll tell you that.

EVENT REVIEW


Sarah Zettel, University alum 
and author of “The Other Sister” 
recently sat down to speak with 
The Daily about her latest release. 
From starting off at the University 
scribbling in “notebooks with 
friends creating shared worlds,” 
today Zettel has produced over 
18 novels in sci-fi, romance, 
fantasy and various other genres. 
“The Other Sister” is a domestic 
suspense and psychological thriller 
that flips the traditional fairytale 
upside down. The novel follows 
two sisters, Geraldine and Marie 
Monroe through secretive schemes 
and abnormal familial dynamics. 
From my conversation with Zettel 
it is is clear that her latest work is 
laced with darker shades of human 
psyche and the dichotomy of good 
and evil.
Zettel’s inspiration for writing 
“The Other Sister” is tethered to 
her childhood love for the Brothers 
Grimm Fairy Tales. Since she was 
13, she knew she wanted to write in 
a wide variety of literary genres and 
forms. Today her childhood vision 
has blossomed into reality, with her 
various published works ranging 
from science fiction to young adult 
romance to, currently, domestic 
suspense. Zettel recognizes that 
“The Other Sister” belongs under 
the domestic suspense genre.
“It’s more about the idea than 
where it goes on the shelf,” Zettel 

said. 
She is well aware of the good 
and ugly stepsister tropes, but 
what really sparked her inspiration 
for “The Other Sister” was what 
it would be like to be the ugly 
stepsister. She wanted to play with 
a range of emotions and dynamics 
among people.
“Each genre offers you a chance 
to put a new angle on a story,” 
Zettel said. This novel, therefore, 
explores the consequences and 
casualties that occur when darker 
family dynamics are in play.
Fairytales commonly confine 
women to inferior or victimizing 
roles, while men are depicted 
with heroic stature. When I asked 
how Zettel tackled these gendered 
tropes while writing “The Other 
Sister,” she said: “The common 
perception of women that is used 
to keep them in their place is that 
women are not allowed simply to be 
human beings, they are supposed 
to be giving beings.”
This description entails that 
women are expected to give to 
everyone around them.
“If she doesn’t give enough 
and in the right ways then she is a 
bad woman and you can do what 
you want to her,” Zettel said. She 
wanted to explore what happens 
when women don’t “give properly.” 
Zettel 
explained 
that 
women 
simply are not allowed to be angry 
about 
anything, 
neither 
their 
status nor the expectation put on 
them to give to others without any 
reciprocation.

“I also wanted to explore what 
happens when you either refuse 
not to suppress your anger or you 
hide it so well that you are left with 
very few options,” Zettel said. She 
sympathizes with Geraldine for 
this same reason, as Geraldine is 
the troubled and outcasted sister 
in contrast to her more conforming 
sibling Marie.
To Zettel, any form of writing 
or public expression by women is 
inherently a feminist act.
“It’s finally allowing us to give 
voice to the range of what it is to 
be complete human and to be a 
woman,” Zettel commented on 
writing. Zettel described that 
suspense and thriller genres allow 
writers and readers to look at how 
anger, violence and justice uniquely 
affect women. She cites “Gone Girl” 
as a recent example of a suspense 
novel and film that deconstructs 
representations of women as the 
“perfect victim.”
“It is a really interesting piece 
of work,” Zettel said. “Deliberately 
feminist or not, it is a deeply 
feminist piece of work”
In 
the 
past, 
Zettel 
wrote 
full-time nestled in her garret 
with a cat and now finds herself 
working in a well-lit, social writing 
workspace; 
her 
extroverted 
personality is thriving. You can 
tell she is a prolific author with 
exceptional enthusiasm for her 
craft. Zettel is engaging, passionate 
and 
determined 
to 
cultivate 
constructive depictions of women 
in her work.

‘Bohemian’ biopic can’t 
remember that it’s a story

Can a character survive if his 
story is taken away?
This is a risky question for 
any 
storyteller 
to 
entertain. 
Unfortunately, that didn’t stop the 
makers of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” 
a film that markets itself as a Queen 
biopic and waits to deliver on that 
promise until the latter portion of 
its runtime, until it’s too late.
Leading up to that transition 
into 
legitimate 
storytelling, 
Bryan 
Singer’s 
(“X-Men”) 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” is hardly 
a story. Instead, the disjointed 
scenes chronicling Queen’s rise 
seem like a highlight reel: one 
scene per episode of success in 
Queen’s career. The effects of this 
approach are emotionally varied 
but unvaryingly detrimental. On 
one hand, the highlight reel erases 
struggle in favor of a dizzyingly 
rapid, romantic and easy road to 
success. The dialogue also slackens 
without a story to support it, so the 
filmmakers’ habit of writing their 
theses about the significance of 
Queen into conversations between 
members of Queen and record 
executives feels contrived and 
questionable in turn.
The direct consequence of the 
vacancy of story and the attempt 
to fill this void, however, is the 
effects 
on 
Freddie 
Mercury’s 
characterization. Though Rami 
Malek (“Mr. Robot”) makes the 
most of every scene, the answer 
to the opening inquiry — can a 
character survive without a story? 
— is still, by and large: No.
The filmmakers, having opted 
for the convenience of the highlight 
reel over the tedium of crafting a 
story, must then portray Mercury 
within this framework. So, in the 
fragmented spirit of highlight reels, 

they truncate Mercury’s identity 
crises. In doing so, not only do they 
squander Malek’s versatility as 
an actor, but they also ignore the 
realities of how humans come to 

terms with their social identities.
Initially, “Bohemian Rhapsody” 
emphasizes 
Mercury’s 
racial 
identity. A handful of early scenes 
— including a tense disagreement 
with his conservative father about 
nightclub visits and Mercury’s 
family’s 
disappointment 
after 
Mercury had his given name, 
Farrokh Bulsara, legally changed 
— suggest Mercury struggled to 
embrace his Parsi heritage. Then, 
Mercury leaves home, and the 
filmmakers drop this development 
entirely; they fixate abruptly on 
Mercury’s sexual identity instead. 
This truncation is problematic 
not only for the purposes of biopic 
but for intersectionality. Why 
can’t Mercury confront his racial, 
national 
and 
sexual 
identities 
synchronously? Why must anyone 
ever be reduced to one social 
identity? What was convenient for 
the filmmakers disenfranchises 
those who identify with multiple 
marginalized groups.
In part three of Mercury’s 
truncated identity crises, Mercury 
hits a low point and suffers 
from loneliness and substance 
abuse. On the one hand, these 
challenges 
transcend 
social 
identity and initiate a long-awaited 
character arc. In other words, 
Mercury becomes a character and 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” remembers 
it’s his story. On the other hand, it’s 

too late for the film to fully recover 
from the absence of a story, so his 
low point as a character cannot be 
ascribed to a preexisting character 
arc; the only factor audiences 
have to point to is the most recent 
identity crisis, and that is Mercury’s 
coming out as bisexual. Once 
again, the filmmakers’ pseudo-
storytelling inadvertently wounds 
the 
marginalized 
communities 
the film and Mercury’s portrayal 
should have empowered.
Though by no means does 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” becoming 
a story right its wrongs, it gives 
the film the narrative momentum 
it needs. In turn, the film is 
able to work toward a climax, 
and it delivers. The concluding 
sequence, 
capturing 
Queen’s 
1985 performance at Live Aid, 
is the invigorating, rewarding 
antithesis of the highlight reel. It 
is patiently, unromantically shot. 
And for all the ways “Bohemian 
Rhapsody” disrespected Mercury 
as an individual, the film always 
respected Queen’s music, and 
this scene is no exception. Most 
notably, this scene proves one of the 
theses about Queen’s significance 
haphazardly inserted into dialogue 
at the beginning of the film: 
Everything Queen did was out of 
love and respect for their fans. After 
watching this sequence, comprised 
of alternating footage of Queen’s 
knockout performance and the 
audience’s enthusiastic responses 
to it, there is no doubt about Queen’s 
distinctive love for their fan base.
While the recovery portion of 
the film doesn’t compensate for 
its initial series of shortcomings, it 
opens up two possibilities. It will 
likely leave the audience members 
who managed to hurdle the initial 
disappointments with a craving for 
Queen’s music and, hopefully, the 
raw materials to construct a more 
holistic portrait of Mercury as well.

It’s raining on Election Day

It’s raining on Election Day. 
Generally speaking, turnout is 
lower when it rains on election 
day, and when turnout is lower 
it’s bad for Democrats. Now, 
this is an entertainment and 
media column and you might 
think that an entertainment 
and media columnist should 
stick to writing articles about 
blockbusters and pop artists 
and the state of the industry, 
but today is the first Tuesday 
in November. I just got back 
from my voting precinct, and 
it’s raining on Election Day. 
Tonight, Twitter and Facebook 
and all the news networks and 
most of the late-night shows 
will be solely focused on the 
midterms and the incoming 
results. I’d be lying if I said I 
wasn’t focused on them too.
It’s been a long two years. I 
think, regardless of where you 
fall on the political spectrum, 
it’s hard to disagree with that. 
Do you remember Sean Spicer? 
What about the Mooch? That 
Supreme 
Court 
battle 
that 
seemed to last for an eternity? 
Or have there been two of those? 
I may have forgotten. The pace 
of our collective memory has 
become so relentless that the 
controversies of yesterday feel 
like trivialities compared to 
today. It’s not just in politics. 
These past two years since the 
election of Donald J. Trump 
have seen major upheavals 
in the entertainment world 
as well. The consolidation of 
media companies has continued 
unchecked, with Disney and 
Fox set to merge and join the 
AT&T and Time Warner mega-
conglomerate that solidified 
early this year. Three Star Wars 
movies have come and gone, 

a dozen more Marvel flicks 
have hit the screens and the 
DC movie universe collapsed 
before our very eyes. Also, on 
their way out the door, a long 
list of powerful film executives 

and 
creatives 
have 
been 
taken down by the #MeToo 
movement in the wake of the 
Harvey Weinstein scandal.
I sometimes will joke to my 
friends that the 2016 election, 
the success of Michigan sports 
and the quality of various 
entertainment 
products 
I 
enjoy can be directly linked. 
Going into Nov. 2016, Michigan 
Football was undefeated and 
ranked third in the country. 
Four days after Donald Trump 
got elected, Michigan dropped 
a heartbreaker to Iowa and, at 
the end of the month, J.T. was 
stopped short — or at least we 
Michigan fans think he was. 
Going into Nov. 2016, the “Star 
Wars” franchise had made a 
triumphant return and was 
poised to recapture its former 
glory as the granddaddy of all 
film franchises. Two years 
and three controversial movies 
later, 
the 
franchise 
seems 
doomed to relish in its own past 
for eternity. Like America, it 

can’t move forward. Two years 
and seven episodes later and 
George R.R. Martin is nowhere 
close to finishing the books 
series that has become the 
basis for the TV phenomenon 
“Game 
of 
Thrones.” 
He’s 
trapped in stasis. Of course, a 
rational mind knows that none 
of these things are connected. 
In my mind, however, they will 
always be inextricably linked.
This year, Michigan seems 
poised to at long last reclaim 
its rightful place at the top 
of the Big Ten conference. A 
date with destiny in Columbus 
seems inevitable and you can’t 
help but feel that at long last 
our time has come. All of the 
polling seems to indicate a huge 
win for Gretchen Whitmer 
and a strong chance for the 
Democrats to take back the 
House. The leaks coming out 
of Belfast seem to indicate that 
the last season of “Game of 
Thrones” will be good. But with 
Dylan McCaffrey out, Michigan 
is just one bad play away 
from having to start a third-
string quarterback, “Game of 
Thrones” has never been the 
same since they passed the 
books, J.J. Abrams is surely 
just going to remake “Return 
of the Jedi” and it’s raining 
on Election Day. Maybe I will 
wake up tomorrow and all of 
my blue wave dreams will come 
true. But if these two punishing 
years have taught me anything, 
it’s the same thing that has been 
ingrained into me as a Michigan 
and Detroit sports fan since I 
could breathe: “Hope for the 
best, expect the worst.” I think 
I’ll put an old episode of “The 
West Wing” up on the TV to 
cheer myself up. After all, it’s

FILM REVIEW

TESSA ROSE
Daily Arts Writer

Sarah Zettel, on suspense, 
women and ‘Other Sister’

Still to this day, the critical 
acclaim and awe surrounding 
Orson Welles and his classics like 
“Citizen Kane” and “Touch of 
Evil” holds strong. The legendary 
actor / director, who gained 
stardom in the ’40s and ’50s, is, 
no doubt, an icon of cinematic 
history. However, Welles’s latest, 
posthumous release, “The Other 
Side of the Wind,” may not 
resonate with modern audiences 
unexposed to the rest of his body 
of work and reputation. Though 
filled with entrancing cinematic 
techniques 
true 
to 
Welles’s 
style, the plot of the film mirrors 
Welles’s own life, and “The Other 
Side of the Wind” only connects to 
a specific, niche audience, while 
making the typical movie-goer 
feel little more than confusion 
and disjointedness. 
The film revolves around the 
major, yet fading Hollywood 
director 
Jake 
Hannaford 
(John 
Huston, 
“Chinatown”). 
At Hannaford’s 70th birthday 
party, his newest and final film 
is debuted for throngs of rowdy 
party-attendees, reporters and 
fellow 
Hollywood 
associates. 
The film, also titled “The Other 
Side of the Wind,” is unfinished, 
fragmented and likely won’t be 
distributed, as Hannaford has 
only four days to complete it. 
Interspersed between alcohol-
saturated 
conversations 
with 
prodding reporters and fame-
seeking friends at the party are 

sequences of Hannaford’s film 
itself, which can only be described 
as a bizarre, hyper-sexualized, 
semi-romantic chase between an 
attractive man and woman with 
no dialogue. As the party unfolds, 
the reporters and fans become 
increasingly eager to “figure out” 
the mysterious Hannaford, but as 
the night goes on Hannaford only 
becomes more and more closed 

off, seemingly far more interested 
in finding another bottle of booze 
than engaging with his guests. 
Reflective of Welles’s use of 
mirrors and light in “Citizen 
Kane,” 
the 
manipulation 
of 
light, dark, visual and auditory 
synchronization throughout the 
film is captivating. In both the 
segments at the party and within 
the screening of Hannaford’s 
film, 
there 
is 
an 
apparently 
indiscriminate tradeoff between 
black-and-white 
and 
color 
sequences. With no identifiable 
pattern for when and why one 
segment is black-and-white while 
the next is in color, Welles creates 
a feeling of intrigue and surprise 
within viewers. Especially within 
the 
film-screening 
portions, 
the pairing of sound and image 
is mesmerizing. In one part of 
Hannaford’s film, the nameless 
male and female protagonists hop 
into a cab to escape the rain. The 
two begin kissing and touching 

in the back of the car, illuminated 
by the bright green and red of the 
traffic lights and the condensation 
from the rain outside. The scene 
is simultaneously sensual and 
uncomfortable, as the two lovers 
continue to caress to a drum-like 
beat while the cab driver sits only a 
few feet in front of them. As the film 
within the film has no dialogue, 
there is nothing to distract from 
the discomfort we feel, and we are 
thus forced to watch the peculiar 
love scene pan out.
Though Welles’s techniques 
are provocative, eye-catching and 
evidently creative, for the average 
audience member, establishing 
a genuine connection to the film 
proves 
difficult. 
Everything 
about the film is fragmented. 
The movie shown at the birthday 
party is continually interrupted 
by numerous power outages and 
conversations between characters 
at the party are constantly 
cut short, making it difficult 
to invest in anyone on-screen. 
Additionally, there is an overall 
sense of incompleteness that we 
can’t help but feel, brought on 
both by the scattered nature of 
the filming, the incompleteness 
of the screened film within the 
film and the disconnect and 
tension between Hannaford and 
his actors. When the credits role, 
we can’t help but wonder if we 
should have brushed up on our 
knowledge of Welles beforehand 
to 
make 
Hannaford, 
as 
a 
protagonist crafted in Welles’s 
image, more tangible and maybe 
even make the film as a whole 
more enjoyable.

in 
order 
for 
any 
of this anti-racist activism to 
work, you all need to constantly 
be 
checking 
your 
privilege.
That means not telling your 
students they will not succeed 
because of where they are from.
Looking at you, University of 
Michigan,

College 
That means not castigating a 
Black student on her tone and 
thoughts in front of 80 of her white 
peers for saying what she thinks.
And you, University of Michigan 
Professor

not

you,

Do not create class activities 
about race that require the 
Black kids to pretend to be the 
victims in horrible tragedies, 
i.e., the Philando Castile trial.
I’m looking at you, University of

That means listening to the 
concerns of your students of color.
That 
means, 
being 
more 
conscious of the people who 
occupy space in your classroom,

is 
an 
immensely

you haven’t had to go through.

How Not to be Racist: Chapter 2 
Compliments and Comments

Microaggressions, also known 
as the shit white people have 
been doing for years but until 
recently, we never had a name 
for it!
Microaggressions are not an ex-
aggeration of liberal feelings.
They are an insidious and per-
vasive part of American culture 
that repeatedly denigrate the 
efforts and strides of people of 
color and women toward equity.
Columbia University professor 
Derald Wing Sue coined the 
term microaggression to refer 
to “brief and commonplace dai-
ly verbal, behavioral, or envi-
ronmental indignities, whether 
intentional or unintentional, 
that communicate hostile, de-
rogatory, or negative racial 
slights and insults toward peo-
ple of color.”

Microaggressions
Common Examples

 
Saying this to a person of color is 
particularly demeaning.
Calling someone articulate can 
be a nod toward racist ideas that 
a Black person isexceptional for 
being well-spoken, whereas it is 
expected and normal for white 
people to be.

It’s rude to assume someone 
isn’t from where they tell you 
they’re from just because they 
don’t look like you.

A wealth of research suggests 
that people with difficult-to-
pronounce names have a harder 
time finding work and are 
considered less likable. When 
you ask someone their name, 
don’t judge it. Try to learn it. 
You can say Tchaikovsky and 
Rachmaninoff. 
Maybe 
you 
should try unpacking your 
white supremacy instead of 
enforcing it on other people.

“Wow, is that your real hair?” / “You mean you don’t wash 
your hair every day?”/ “So do you take those out at night? 
”/ “Like how do you wash your hair?”

Damn, Becky! Mind your own 
damn business! Please be 
mindful of your comments. 
Nobody likes to be perceived 
as weird, exotic or strange. 
Never ask someone why they 
wear something — whether 
it’s a hijab or hair extensions. 
Let them live.

You probably sound racist/
homophobic/sexist. If you have 
to preface a statement with
saying you don’t want to sound 
a certain way, it’s probably
because you’re about to sound 
that way.

See above.

“I went to the beach the entire weekend 
and look, I’m almost as dark as you!”

This is not a compliment. I am 
not ashamed of my race, and 
there is nothing of which to be 
ashamed for identifying with 
one race or another. There 
are good and bad people of all 
races.

“You all” / “You go, girl” / “Yo,” “Word” and “What Up” 
as an introduction whenever you’re greeting your 
Black peers / saying phrases that end with the term 
“girlfriend” when you’re not referencing a woman 
you’re dating

 “All Lives Matter – not 
just Black people.”

Saying All Lives Matter is like 
saying all diseases matter at a 
breast cancer rally.

All Black people do not do the 
same things.

“I have a white coworker who dates Black men. She 
and her boyfriend at the time were having issues. 
So, she was venting to me about him and called him 
a nigger. Nigger this. Nigger that. After regaining my 
composure, I asked her why she think it’s OK to say 
nigger in my presence. She replied that she should 
get a pass because she acts Black, dates Black and 
considers herself Black.”

Stereotyping Black women as 
sassy is bad. It is damaging to 
Black women, and can even 
lead Black women to have 
health issues, despite them 
telling the truth.
The hell I do. “My African-
American over here”?
“Shithole countries”? Bitch, 
please.

If you need to know why calling a 
Black girl “pretty” is wrong, read 
Mic’s article “9 Things Everyone 
Needs to Stop Saying to Black 
Women Immediately.”

“You should join our company basketball 
team.” (They’ve never seen you play.)

 “Are you real Black?”
“Are both of your parents 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Black?”

For the record, most Black
people in America are mixed 
with something.

Cultural Appropriation 

Cultural appropriation isn’t a 
fuzzy line.
It isn’t hard to discern. It’s 
quite simple.
Cultural appropriation is the 
adoption of elements of a
minority culture by members 
of the dominant culture.

* White people who go to all 
white fraternity parties and play 
all Black music.
* White people adopting AAVE 
to sound funny or “urban” (also 
known as Ebonics).
* White people wearing dread-
locks.
* White people wearing

mockery of a traditional
cultural dress without
expressed permission or
cultural exchange from a
member of that culture.
* White people profiting off of 
culture without a meaningful 
exchange and understanding of 
privilege and power.

Examples Include

Hey, Karen. I Just wanted 
you to know you might want to 
change your Halloween costume 
from Pocahontas to basic bitch.
Please 
stop 
doing 
problematic 
things.
 It’s annoying and I’m tired 
of writing articles about it.
Cultural appropriation turns 
cultural elements into a costume.
 It often goes unchecked in 

beauty. Culture is erased and 
belittled. 
The 
repackaging 
of 
products 
as 
“cool” 
or 
“trendy” 
marginalizes 
those 
whose 
culture 
to 
which 
they belong. Think of Kylie 
Jenner’s 
“birthday 
braids” 
making 
headlines, 
even 
though 
they’re 
the 
same 
cornrows that have been worn 
by Black women for ages.
Or the idea of laying baby 
hairs, even though it’s been 

a staple of Black hairdos for 
ages. Or the use of bindis as 
a “trendy” culture. Or the 
adoption of Tibetan Buddhism 
by mainstream, middle class 
Han Chinese folk to seem 
cool. Or the trend of the large 
beauty supply earrings for $2 
that were sold in H&M for $20. 
This trend is nefarious when 
the cultural appropriation is 
used for profit, which is why it 
may 
soon 
become 
illegal.

Blackface and a short history

Ah, blackface. Old buddy, 
old pal.
We haven’t seen you in a 
while…Oh, wait. That was 
last year.
Blackface is wrong.
It’s not funny. It’s not cool. 
It’s not quirky.
It’s just racist.
So:
From minstrel shows, to 
golliwogs, 
to 
scientific 
racism –
Blackface is used to make 
fun of and demean Black 
people.
Just don’t do it. It’s not that 
hard.

How to not be racist: Chapter 3

“Devil’s 
Advocate” 
and 
“All sides of the argument”
Chad, 
nobody 
wants 
to 
hear you say, “Well, if I was a 
slave owner, I would be mad 
my 
property 
is 
gone 
too!”

Devil’s 
advocate 
can 
be 
used as a tool to know what 
traditionally 
racist 
and 
bigoted 
people 
would 
say.
But please don’t say “If I were” 
to things and then say a sentiment 

of things that are vehemently 
repulsive, or actively threatens 
the livelihood of people of color.
My life is more important 
than your shitty hypothetical 
attempt to devalue my life.

Classroom Etiquette

Power Dynamics: Voices in the Room

Recognizing 
power 
and 
privilege in a room is absolutely 
paramount 
to 
having 
more 
fruitful discussion and discourse.
Meaning, you should step back 
for a second when you’re in the 
classroom talking about racism.
Listen to the people of color 
in the room. The Indigenous, 
Black 
and 
Brown 
voices.
Acknowledge 
how 
you 
move throughout the world 
and 
your 
experiences.

“There is nothing glamorous 
about 
being 
subjected 
to 
racism, and certainly no social 
rewards to be reaped from being 
the victim of oppression in a 
society that heaps disadvantage 
on 
historically 
marginalized 
groups,” Atlantic journalist Simba 
Runyowa wrotein an article 
about 
microaggressions. 
“So 
why would people willingly 
designate themselves as victims 
if they do not truly feel that way? 

The only people who benefit 
from oppression are the ones 
who are exempt from it — not 
the ones who suffer through it.”
Do not talk over women. Do 
not talk over women of color. 
Do not talk over people of 
color when they try to speak 
about 
their 
experiences, 
no 
matter how “offended” you feel.
This 
country 
would 
benefit 
from 
a 
lot 
of 
listening. Please try to do so.

Professors, and People in Power

What is the purpose of saying this? Why are you using your 
perceived darkness as a lighthearted comment to compare 
to your whiteness? Newsflash, you can’t wash my Black off. 
It’s different.

Not all Black people play basketball.
Stereotyping is wrong.

Stop with the foolishness. Do not try to use African-
American Vernacular English as comedic relief.
It’s not your culture, stop saying that shit. I don’t over 
exaggerate my code switching/white accent when I’m 
talking to you.

Not that it’s any of your business, but we can go various amounts 
of time without washing our hair because not all of us get greasy 
and nasty. 
Asking people of color if their hair is real is intrusive and rude. 
This is especially rude because there’s a long history of oppress-
ing women of color in public spaces like schools and offices for 
wearing their hair naturally.

 “You’re so articulate.”

“Why do you wear that
(insert item)?”

“I don’t want to sound 
racist/homophobic/sexist 
but …”

Any phrase starting with 
“So, do Black people …”

“Your name is
impossible to pronounce!”

“No, where are 
you really from?”

“You’re different, not 
like them, the other 
ones …”

 “I want you to be nice
 today… not sassy.”

“You have to
understand Trump.”

“You’re the prettiest black 
girl I’ve ever seen.”

“Not to make it a 
race/gay/gender thing 
but …”

A 

couple of months ago, I 
called my dad to complain. 
I don’t even 
remember 
what 
I 
was 
calling 
to 
complain 
about. 
Before jumping into 
my tirade, I asked 
him how his day was 
going. He said, with 
a big sigh, something 
along the lines of, 
“Well I showed up 
to the scene of an 
accident today where 
the victim was dead on arrival.” 
He wasn’t wearing his helmet on 
his motorcycle and according to 
my dad, “His brains were all over 
the street.” After telling me this, 
he tried to seamlessly transition 
into asking about my day. Suffice 
to say, I no longer had the heart to 
complain.
My 
dad 
is 
a 
federal 
law 
enforcement officer for the USDA 
Forest Service, former emergency 
medical technician, former SWAT 
team sniper and an army veteran. 
After we hung up the phone, I 
thought about what it would be 
like to show up to a scene like that 
even once in my life, nonetheless 
potentially multiple times as part 
of my job. I couldn’t imagine seeing 
somebody’s brains on the street, but 
I knew it wasn’t the first time my 
dad had. In the course of his career 
as a first responder and LEO, he 
has saved people from falling over 
waterfalls, hiked countless miles 
to find missing persons, dealt with 
domestic violence disputes and drug 
seizures, served warrants to violent 
felons and has put his life on the line 
for the sake of justice many times.
For most of my life, when my dad 
suited up and left the house in the 
morning, my family began to hold 
its breath, and nobody breathed a 
sigh of relief until he came home 
again at night. We rarely talked 
about it, but all felt it. When I was 
in middle school, we lived in Scioto 
County, Ohio, which was making 
a name for itself as a county at the 
center of the nation’s increasing 
opioid epidemic. We had the highest 
rates of prescription drug overdoses 
in the state and were fighting drug-
related crime in almost every level 
of society, from upscale doctors 

running pill mills all the way to 
the young addicts robbing houses 
and 
stores 
for 
drug 
money. The more my dad 
enforced the rules and 
cracked down on illegal 
activity, the more hostile 
our environment became. 
People would drive up 
our driveway to confront 
my dad and even threaten 
him. They would drive by 
our house and fire shots 
in the air or into our barn. 
I remember lying in bed 
many nights far past my bedtime 
waiting to hear the sound of his car 
coming up the driveway so I would 
know he had made it home one more 
night.
All of this tension took a toll on 
our whole family. When my dad 
was off work, he was often irritable 
and unsettled. We weren’t allowed 
to wear jerseys to sporting events 
that had our last names on the 
back because it could potentially 
put us in danger. We were never 
to tell anyone who our father was, 
and if anybody asked about him 
we were immediately to call one of 
our parents. We weren’t allowed 
to answer the door or the phone at 
home and we went over multiple 
times where to hide in our house if 
someone were to break in.
The violence and threats against 
our family seemed to be escalating 
for some time and it finally reached 
its boiling point in my eighth-grade 
year. Someone had apparently 
waited on the hill above my dad’s 
parking spot at home to “put some 
lead in him.” They failed to follow 
through on this threat due to 
nothing short of a miracle. That 
very night as he arrived home, my 
dad realized he left something he 
needed for the morning at his office 
40 minutes away. He turned around 
just a few minutes from home and 
because of this he didn’t make it 
home before dark. The next day a 
friend of the man who wished to 
commit the crime came in and told 
my dad of his friend’s plan saying 
the guilt had overwhelmed him 
and that my dad needed to watch 
his back from now on. Not very 
long after this incident, in one final 
attempt to commit violence against 
our family, this same man came onto 

our property and shot and killed our 
family dog, Pepper, just 10 feet from 
our front door.
After this, an investigation was 
finally launched and my dad was 
offered a “safety and security 
transfer” to another region. We 
moved to beautiful Ludington, 
Michigan at the beginning of my 
freshman year of high school 
in hopes of leaving the violence 
and hate behind us. We found 
the people in Ludington and 
the surrounding areas to be 
much more respectful of law 
enforcement in general, but just as 
the tides of fortune were turning 
in our direction, the politics 
surrounding the law enforcement 
community began to heat up. The 
cases of Eric Garner and Michael 
Brown put the law enforcement 
community under intense scrutiny 
as the narratives of police brutality 
and racial discrimination began to 
rise to the surface of the political 
media spotlight.
The 
conversation 
around 
police brutality was obviously an 
important one to have considering 
the grievances so much of our 
nation was voicing. Yet, in the 
wake of the threats and violence 
my family had just faced, hearing 
so much vitriol aimed at the police 
community as a whole was often 
very hard for us all. When friends 
and acquaintances began to tweet 
about police being “pigs” and 
protests against police became 
more violent — with some fringe 
groups of protests even touting 
phrases such as “What do we want? 
Dead cops! When do we want 
it? Now!” — it became apparent 
that the police community was 
undergoing a form of stereotyping 
that, as a police officer’s daughter, 
struck me as very counterintuitive 
in the movement for peace and 
justice. Instead of voicing general 
frustrations at the system, my 
father and other officers we knew 
began to face personal attacks that 
increased the tension of their work 
environments.

“I

t’s a dangerous time to 
be a journalist.” NPR’s 
“Up First” podcast 
ended the discussion of Saudi 
journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s 
alleged 
murder 
with 
this 
remark. All around the world, 
journalists have been dealing 
with physical attacks, as well 
as attacks on their journalistic 
integrity. According to the U.S. 
Press Freedom Tracker, 41 
journalists have faced physical 
attacks in 2018, and five have 
been killed. With Khashoggi’s 
murder headlining the news, 
and President Donald Trump’s 
steady stream of insults aimed 
at the free press while on his 
midterm tours, this attack on 
journalistic integrity and the 
free press is gaining ground and 
making life more dangerous for 
journalists and civilians alike.
Since Trump took office in 2016, 
the idea of “fake news” has become 
a prevalent topic in politics. While 
the term fake news is not one of 
Trump’s own invention, nor is he 
even the first politician to use it in 
such a way as to attack the press, 
it has taken on almost a second 
definition. According to a study by 
researchers Rasmus Kleis Nielsen 
and Lucas Graves, most scholars 
and professionals agree that fake 
news should be, “Associated with 
misinformation 
from 
different 
sources, 
including 
journalists. 
Seen as distinguishable from news 
primarily by degree,” usually in 
relation to perceptions of satire, poor 
journalism, propaganda, advertising 
and false news. However, it is now 
being “weaponized by critics of the 
news media as well as by critics of 
platform companies” to invalidate 
certain news sources, the current 
instigator being Trump.
Time and time again, Trump 
makes remarks about the press 
falsely attacking him, naming them 
a danger to society. Feeling attacked 
due to being under the constant 
microscope of the press, Trump 
chose to return fire to one of the 
most important aspects of a free 
democracy. He has decided that 
he doesn’t like journalists telling 
the public the facts about what his 
administration is doing and that he 
will do his best to invalidate these 

facts by preaching to his followers 
that it is all fake.
“The 
media 
also 
has 
a 
responsibility to set a civil tone and 
to stop the endless hostility and 
constant negative and oftentimes 
false attacks and stories,” Trump 
said at a rally in Wisconsin while 
he was on the midterm tour. What 
Trump is failing to grasp is that the 
press has absolutely no obligation 
to the government. They have an 
obligation to report the truth, no 
matter how it may portray the 
president, 
government 
officials 
or any other figure. Just because 
Trump doesn’t like what the media 
is saying about him doesn’t make it 
false, and it certainly doesn’t mean 
he should be encouraging hateful 
acts toward journalists who are just 
doing their job.
The press is one of the 
most important checks on the 
government. Its role in society is 
to report the truth, and with that, 
hold the government accountable. 
Instead of understanding the 
importance of free press and 
taking their criticisms as an 
opportunity 
to 
improve 
his 
presidency, Trump has instead 
attempted 
to 
undermine 
the 
importance of a driving force of 
American democracy, which poses 
a danger to society. Labeling the 
press as “the enemy of the people” 
is a fear-mongering tactic used 
by an unpopular president who 
wants to hide any unflattering 
portrayals of his presidency and 
personality from the public. And 
yet, it’s kind of working.
According to a survey published 
by CBS, 91 percent of strong Trump 
supporters consider the information 
he delivers to be accurate, but 
only 11 percent trust the media. 
So when Trump spews hate about 
The New York Times and other 
mainstream, historically reliable 
media, unfortunately, people listen. 
This is certainly evident in the 
abusive treatment of journalists 
that has been spreading all over 
the world. Khashoggi is only one 
example of how dangerous it is to be 
a journalist in this current climate. 
Leaders everywhere and in all 
types of government, from Syria to 
Venezuela and from authoritarian to 
populist, are following Trump’s lead 

and attacking the free press. When 
other leaders see the president of 
the land of the free attack one of the 
fundamental aspects of its freedom, 
it seems to give them permission to 
do the same.
Even other U.S. government 
officials are jumping on the anti-
press bandwagon. Trump actually 
praised U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, 
R-Mont., 
for 
bodyslamming 
a 
reporter. I’m no lawyer, but I’m 
pretty sure that would be considered 
civil abuse, which is illegal. While 
this is terrible, considering our 
President’s track record, it’s not 
surprising. What is more terrifying 
is the audience’s response. After his 
statement, they cheered and began 
jeering at other reporters in the 
audience, one man even re-enacting 
a body slam and making threatening 
hand gestures. Some of us try to 
give ourselves peace of mind by 
convincing ourselves that Trump 
is only one heretic and that most 
rational people don’t actually believe 
the absurdities he constantly spouts. 
This attack and response, however, 
reveals the terrifying truth that 
Trump is not alone in his hatred, and 
that we are all in grave danger.
Journalism is absolutely essential 
to a free country and an accountable 
government. We are incredibly lucky 
to live in a country where the freedom 
of the press is a constitutional right 
no matter who is in power or what 
they say about it. But a president who 
constantly threatens and degrades 
the media is not only misguided but 
also dangerous. Unfortunately, we 
live in a world where it is dangerous 
to be a journalist. But that is why 
it’s important. Journalists have the 
power to generate change and have 
been using this power since the 
founding of this country. From high 
school newspapers to The New York 
Times, every level of journalism 
plays a role in making change, 
whether it be at a high school or in 
the White House. We cannot allow 
one asinine blip on this country’s 
timeline destroy a fundamental part 
of our democracy. We cannot be 
considered the land of the free if we 
are not free to speak our minds.

It’s a dangerous time to be a journalist

I 

spent this past Saturday 
morning holding back tears. 
For 
my 
Judaic 
Studies 
class, I went to a conservative 
Shabbat service at a conservative 
synagogue in Ann Arbor. When 
I first saw the assignment on my 
syllabus back in September, I 
didn’t think much of it. I thought 
the conservative service would 
be akin to the services at the 
Reform synagogue I grew up 
going to, but longer and more 
formal. The only difference was 
that it just so happened that the 
Shabbat service was a week after 
the Pittsburgh shooting.
Jews and non-Jews of all 
ages filled the room in a show of 
support. There was a mourners’ 
Kaddish — a prayer for lost loved 
ones — dedicated to the victims. 
After, three rabbis gave eloquent 
sermons about what happened in 
Pittsburgh. And, though it was 
overall a solemn and, at times, 
melancholic two hours in the 
synagogue, I left feeling much 
better, mostly because of the 
head rabbi’s exceptional sermon. 
 
The head rabbi’s sermon was 
delivered at the very end of the 
service. First, he argued that his 
interpretation of Jewish values 
supports tolerance and inclusion 
and that Jews should support 
globalization, 
immigration, 
refugees and diversity because 
of the moral teachings in the 
Torah. He told the congregation 
that Abraham, who was thought 
of as the first patriarch of the 
Jewish people, was a refugee. 
Abraham sought refuge in both 
the promised land of Canaan and 
later in Egypt. His wife Sarah, 
the first matriarch of the Jewish 
people, should be revered for 
her strength because she was 
welcoming of Abraham, even 
though he was born in a different 
land and had different customs. 
 
He concluded that ultimately, 
tolerance and love will defeat 
intolerance and hate.
Continuing with the theme of 
tolerance and diversity, the head 
rabbi argued that adherence 
to the moral and religious 
precepts of Judaism trumps 
having Jewish ancestry as a 
determinant of Jewish identity. 
The rabbi was arguing for a 
more universalist conception of 
Jewish identity, rather than a 
particularist conception where 
shared 
ancestry 
through 
a 
Jewish mother defined Jewish 
identity. The more universalist 
conception of Jewish identity the 
rabbi argued for was primarily 
about 
adherence 
to 
Jewish 
moral and religious values. The 
rabbi 
told 
the 
congregation 
that like America itself, Jewish 
communities 
all 
across 
the 
country were becoming more 
diverse. He contested the view 

retained in parts of the Jewish 
and 
rabbinical 
community 
that 
lament 
intermarriage 
and the loss of a particular 
Jewish ethnic peoplehood. He 
predicted proudly that in 40 
years, the congregation of the 
synagogue we were all sitting in 
would be much more ethnically 
and racially diverse, as would 
America. As a half-Filipino Jew, 
I found this comforting.

I realized during the walk back 
to my apartment that the rabbi’s 
argument about Jewish identity, 
of values versus genealogy, is 
also applicable to American 
identity. In this country, we are 
facing a fundamental choice of 
what it means to be an American. 
Like Judaism, American identity 
has had a tension between 
universalism and particularism. 
The 
U.S. 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
and 
the 
Constitution speak of ostensibly 
universal values, in the form of 
“unalienable” rights, liberties 
and equality. These values are 
central to the American identity 
and what it means to be part of 
“We the people.” But, for much 
of American history, the ability 
to benefit from these values have 
been particular to white men, 
rather than universal. Racism 
and sexism, in the form of 
slavery, segregation and barriers 
to citizenship and other rights 
is omnipresent in our history. 
Some would argue this history 
of particularism is still similarly 
impinging today as it was in the 
past, while others, like myself, 
would argue vast progress has 
been made. But there is still work 
that needs to be done.
As 
Americans, 
we 
have 
a choice. Will we live up to 
the promise of America that 
Martin Luther King Jr. spoke 
of, 
where 
American 
values 
and thus identity are truly 
universal, or will we continue 
the disappointments of the past? 
Fulfilling America’s promise is 
not only a legal matter. Equal 
application of laws and rights 
are an integral part of achieving 
equality. But, fulfilling America’s 
promise is also an extralegal, 
social matter. All Americans 
should be able to reasonably 
feel that they are equal rights-

bearing individuals, free and 
able to pursue their happiness, 
without being limited by race, 
gender, 
sexuality, 
religion, 
among other things.
Yet, 
President 
Trump’s 
Republican 
party 
peddles 
toxic 
rhetoric 
that 
exploits 
prejudicial sentiment embedded 
in our national discourse. This 
type of hateful speech enabled 
the Pittsburgh shooting, the 
Kentucky shooting, the mail 
bombs and the rise in anti-
Semitic hate crimes. Every week 
it’s something new, adding to 
the already extensive annals of 
Trump’s racism.
This 
week, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
is 
fomenting 
paranoia 
about 
a 
migrant 
caravan seeking asylum. Instead 
of portraying the caravan as 
they are — desperate asylum 
seekers who could be accepted 
or turned away at the border — 
the Trump administration has 
turned them into an invasion 
of “gang members.” President 
Trump has said, falsely, that 
there are Middle Easterners in 
the caravan. It wasn’t enough to 
demonize asylum seekers using 
prejudicial tropes about Latin 
Americans, but Trump also had 
to use the stereotype of Middle 
Easterners as terrorists as well. 
A commercial his campaign 
launched about the caravan 
and illegal immigration more 
broadly has been pulled from 
NBC, Facebook and Fox News 
because it was deemed racist. On 
the one hand, the use of racial or 
ethnic stereotypes to demonize 
a group of people by our 
president is an overt example 
of the continuity of racism 
and the failure of American 
values to be truly universal 
— and it presents a very clear 
choice. Trump’s administration 
is moving us away from the 
promise of America Martin 
Luther King Jr. spoke of. Like 
the rabbi I wrote about earlier, 
we can embrace diversity and 
affirm the strength of the values 
that define American identity. 
Or we can do the opposite. We 
can build walls, use divisive 
language and demonize people 
who 
are 
seen 
as 
different 
both inside and outside of our 
country. But as we’ve recently 
seen, doing so comes at a cost. 
So though this will be published 
after the midterms, I hope you 
have voted wisely. The future of 
our country and its communities 
depend on it.

Juwann Bushell-Beatty and the virtue of patience in his fifth season

Juwann Bushell-Beatty had a 
particular confidence about him 
when he first got to Ann Arbor. 
The now-fifth-year-senior says 
he was like most freshman on 
the Michigan football team in 
that way — upbeat that high 
school success would carry over 
to the next level.
“A lot of people coming from 
high school those first few 
years, you have that certain ego 
about you,” Bushell-Beatty said 
Tuesday. “College football can 
be really humbling. You may not 
always get those opportunities. 
There are guys that are better 
than you, there are guys who 
will get more opportunities. 
That may happen.”
That 
was 
Bushell-Beatty’s 
reality.
He did not start his first 
game until 2017 — his fourth 
season with the Wolverines 
— and was in and out of the 
lineup throughout the year. 

The offensive line struggled 
and proved to be the Achilles’ 
heel of Michigan’s lackluster 
offense.
“It 
takes 
a 
while to adjust, 
especially when 
you’re 
young,” 
Bushell-Beatty 
said. “Once you 
accommodate to 
that — you get 
stronger, 
you 
get in playbook, 
you do all these 
things and all 
these 
things 
come together — you get your 
confidence. Confidence is one 
of the most important things.”
During fall camp, however, 
Bushell-Beatty said that he felt 
that old confidence wane. It 
must not have helped when, to 
open the this season, he and 
redshirt junior Jon Runyan Jr. 
— Michigan’s starting tackles — 
were outmatched consistently 
against Notre Dame’s talent-
laden front seven.

“We knew we should be 
playing better ball,” Bushell-
Beatty said. “We knew we had 
to put better stuff on tape.”
That is exactly 
what 
Bushell-
Beatty and the 
Wolverines have 
done. Michigan 
is 
rushing 
for 
an 
average 
of 
237 
yards 
per 
game and have 
allowed just 11 
sacks since Sept. 
1.
Bushell-
Beatty’s personal improvement, 
meanwhile, has caught the eye 
of the coaching staff. In his 
postgame 
press 
conference 
Saturday, Harbaugh noted that 
athletic director and former 
offensive 
lineman 
Warde 
Manuel thought Bushell-Beatty 
had his best game of his career 
against Penn State — two weeks 
after 
Bushell-Beatty 
had 
a 
similarly strong performance in 
East Lansing.

“The last few weeks, I’ve been 
on an upward trend,” Bushell-
Beatty said. “… Being older, I 
don’t really have the classes 
like the younger 
guys do, so I’m 
just 
putting 
more time into 
film, getting into 
the 
playbook, 
paying attention 
to the opponent, 
working 
on 
techniques 
— 
those 
are 
all 
things you have 
to do.”
Rashan Gary thinks Bushell-
Beatty’s largest leap has come 
in pass protection. In previous 
battles, the junior defensive 
end used to take advantage of 
Bushell-Beatty’s impatience at 
the line of scrimmage.
But, 
recently, 
Gary 
has 
noticed a different approach 
from Bushell-Beatty.
“Sometimes, 
he’ll 
be 
aggressive and shoot his hands, 
and I’ll get them down,” Gary 

said. “But it’s like, ‘Alright, 
now what are you going to do, 
Rashan?’ Now, I got to make the 
move, and he’ll counter it. So 
it’s a great battle, 
and he’s getting 
better.”
Added 
Bushell-Beatty: 
“I think that’s 
probably 
one 
of 
the 
biggest 
things for me, 
just focusing on 
being 
patient. 
I pride myself 
on having quick 
feet and being about to adjust 
quickly. Sometimes, it’s not all 
about that. You got to be more 
patient in pass (protect) and be 

more precise and specific with 
your movements.”
Patience has indeed been 
pivotal for Bushell-Beatty — 
both in his current technique 
and career trajectory overall. 
Five years removed from high 
school, the Wolverines’ starting 
right tackle is finally feeling 
confident — and playing the way 
he once expected to.
“Some people need more reps, 
just need more time,” Bushell-
Beatty said. “Since being an 
offensive lineman is one of 
the most difficult positions on 
the field, it’s not something 
that comes to you right away. 
Once you really get it down pat 
and spend a lot of time on it, it 
becomes a lot more natural.”

time.”

Gary returns to strong D-line after time away

There’s a big difference between 
Rashan Gary’s preparation for the 
Michigan football team’s last road 
game and its upcoming one.
Three 
weeks 
ago 
as 
the 
Wolverines got set to face Michigan 
State, Gary was questionable to 
play with a shoulder injury that he 
suffered before the season began. It 
had kept him out of the three games 
before.
On Tuesday, Gary thought back 
on that time.
“I really wanted to come back 
Michigan State, but I personally 
wasn’t ready,” Gary said. “… With 
my range, I felt that I could do a 
little bit, but you know, throughout 
the week, it wasn’t where I think I 
could come out and give my team 
100 percent.”
Heading into Michigan’s game 
against Rutgers, Gary says his 
health isn’t an issue.

Gary played in the Wolverines’ 
win over Penn State on Saturday, 
albeit on a limited snap count. He 
finished with two tackles and made 
his typical impact on the plays he 
was in.
Gary said it gave him chills 
stepping back on the Michigan 
Stadium turf with his teammates 
after his hiatus.
“I’m like, ‘Yeah, I missed y’all. I 
love y’all,’ ” Gary said. “… It felt good 
putting the pads on somebody else.”
It was an odd time away for 
Gary.
By nature of the way the 
Wolverines 
handle 
injury 
news — they hardly divulge 
any information — speculation 
surrounded Gary.
Some said he was more injured 
than Michigan was leading on. 
Some thought Gary would go the 
route of Nick Bosa and sit out before 
declaring for the NFL Draft. Gary’s 
mom added fuel to the fire by 
posting cryptic Facebook statuses.

Gary says he wasn’t perturbed 
by any of this. He said he never 
considered skipping the rest of his 
games at all and that he tried to stay 
away from the speculation.
“I’m the only person that knows 
what’s going on,” Gary said. “You 
know, I’m the only one that can 
really tell you the real story about 
it. So, you know, having my mom 
speak out on it, that’s what she 
did. You know, that’s my mom, so 
I always support her and what she 
feels, but also, you know, things like 
that, I can’t let that get me mad. I’ve 
still got things to do. I’ve still got 
goals to accomplish, and I just need 
to get back to them.”
The rumors were even stranger 
because Gary wasn’t really missed 
that much by the Wolverines’ 
defense.
His 
backup, 
sophomore 
defensive end Kwity Paye, was 
more than solid in Gary’s absence, 
while junior defensive end Josh 
Uche made a major statement — he 

is now 12th in the country in sacks.
Again, Gary claims not be 
bothered by this, rather giving 
positive reviews of his underlings.
“That’s something I’ve been 
seeing since spring ball and camp,” 
Gary said. “You know, just now that 
they got the opportunity to show 
off and showcase their talents, it’s 
crazy. You know, every time Uche 
goes in, I’m expecting him to get 
a sack. Every time Kwity goes in, 
I’m expecting him to hold it down 
and get a tackle, be an impact. And 
that’s the ability that they have and 
that’s what they’ve been showing. 
I feel like, with me not playing, 
they did a great job coming in and 
stepping up and providing for the 
team in the ways that we needed.”
Perhaps that makes Gary’s 
return all the more impactful.
Michigan’s defensive line, which 
was dominating teams without 
Gary, has now returned a potential 
first-round draft pick.
Poor Rutgers.

‘M’ alum takes second 
at World Championship

Adam Coon stepped onto the 
mat one last time for all the marbles. 
The former Michigan heavyweight 
was paired against Russia’s Sergey 
Semenov in the gold medal match 
of the 2018 World Championships 
on Oct. 28. Win and go down in 
wrestling history. Lose and avoid 
satisfaction with the taste of 
victory fleeting your starved pallet.
Unfortunately for Coon, the 
latter would play out before his very 
eyes. After dropping his opponents 
for four straight pins to land him a 
spot in the final bout, Coon’s run 
would come up one match short. 
And in the end, Coon saw his own 
dominant move, the body lock, 
used against him and fell by a 9-0 
technical fall to Semenov.
The 
body 
lock, 
a 
move 
completed by stepping into your 
opponent and clenching your 
arms around his upper body, led 
Coon to execute devastating upper 
body throws and ultimately pin 
his opponents in dramatic fashion 
throughout the tournament.
What makes Coon’s body lock 
so deadly, though, is not his upper 
body strength, but rather shifty 
footwork that tricks his opponents 
into falling into the lock. Coon uses 
hip bumps, turns and false steps 
to lure his opponent into a prime 
position to be taken down. Falling 
for the siren call of the false step, 
Coon’s opponents then fall victim 
to the throw.
“I’ve been working body locks 
since I first started wrestling 
when I was very young, so I kinda 
grew up in it,” Coon said. “I’ve 
very comfortable in that position, 
especially when I know a lot of 
other people are not. Especially 
the way that I hit it. I have a very 
unorthodox type style from the 
body lock.”
Semenov, on the other hand, 
proved apt at countering Coon’s 
trickery 
and 
confounded 
the 

former Michigan star. Also relying 
heavily on the body lock, Coon 
knew the bout would be a fight for 
the position — though this was a 
fight he could not win.
Moving forward, Coon will look 
to diversify his offensive arsenal in 
the Greco-Roman style of wrestling, 
so as to not use the body lock as a 
crutch in future matches. Offensive 
diversification as well as defensive 
adaptability will be the name of 
the game for Coon’s future training 
regimen. And in order to gain that 
extra edge, this training might not 
happen in the United States.
Leaving 
Budapest 
behind, 
Coon fully intends to continue 
competing in the big international 
tournaments in pursuit of the 
ultimate goal — an Olympic gold 
medal. Along the way, Coon will 
look to monetize his efforts in 
next-level wrestling by pioneering 
the freshly minted American 
Wrestling League (AWL).
The AWL is seeking to create 
professional wrestling — not the 
“chair-over-the-head” kind, but 
legitimate, traditional wrestling 
where athletes can make money 
while they pursue international 
glory in the World Championships 
and 
Olympics. 
After 
getting 
drafted by fellow United States 
team member David Taylor on Nov. 
3, Coon will test the waters of the 
AWL and try to spin wrestling into 
a full-fledged career.
Before he gets another crack 
at the next major international 
tournament, don’t expect Coon to 
fade from the spotlight anytime 
soon. Whether wrestling in the 
AWL, playing tug-of-war against 
50 elementary schoolers or pulling 
trucks by rope, Coon’s stardom has 
grown beyond Michigan, and if all 
goes well, will one day land him 
on top of the podium at the World 
Championship.

Season-opening snoozer
Michigan beats Norfolk State, 63-44

Norfolk State didn’t score its 
first points until seven minutes 
and 16 seconds into the game.
By that point, it was far too 
late.
Sophomore 
guard 
Jordan 
Poole found Charles Matthews 
with a nifty wrap-around pass 
in the post, and the redshirt 
junior 
forward 
finished 
off 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s second possession with 
its first two points. That was as 
close as the Wolverines’ season-
opener would get, as they handily 
beat the overmatched Spartans 
(0-1), 63-44, on Tuesday night.
The night’s most eventful 
moments, in reality, took place 
before the game started and 
after it ended. Fifteen minutes 
before tip-off, the banners for 
Michigan’s Big Ten Tournament 
Championship and Final Four 
appearance last year were raised 
to the Crisler Center rafters.
And when the final buzzer 
sounded, it officially marked 
John 
Beilein’s 
800th 
win 
across all levels 
of 
college 
basketball, 
and 
the Maize Rage 
unveiled another 
banner — this one 
congratulating 
the 
Wolverines’ 
coach 
on 
his 
accomplishment.
“It’s 
800 
wins, it will go 
with those other 
basketballs that are back there,” 
Beilein said. “But it was nice to 
have a poster and so many people 
congratulate you.”
Added sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers: “He tried to 
overlook it and just celebrate our 
opening ‘W,’ but we didn’t let 
him go for that. He was trying 
to talk over us, we were like, 

‘Congrats Coach!’ … But you 
know how Coach (Beilein) is. He 
likes to move forward and just do 
everything in a routine.”
Between those two events, 
Michigan (1-0) did what it was 
expected to do against Norfolk 
State, which went just 14-19 last 
season.
The 
Wolverines 
led 
11-0 
before the Spartans found the 
scoreboard, and just in case there 
was any momentum to be had 
from that, Livers and freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis both 
canned corner 3-pointers to go 
up 15 midway through the half.
The Wolverines took a 27-5 
lead after a Matthews steal and 
layup, but went cold for the rest 
of the first half, as the Spartans 
outscored them, 8-5, over the last 
six and a half minutes.
But despite the inability to buy 
a basket for stretches, Michigan 
was never in any danger, as 
its 
physical 
superiority 
was 
ultimately too much for Norfolk 
State to overcome.
Seven minutes into the second 
half, the Spartans’ C.J. Kelly 
scored to cut their deficit to 18. 
The Wolverines 
promptly went 
on a 15-4 run, 
punctuated 
by 
six points from 
Brazdeikis and 
a 
corner 
trey 
by 
sophomore 
guard 
Eli 
Brooks to cap off 
the run and put 
the game to bed 
with Michigan 
leading, 58-29.
Junior 
center 
Jon 
Teske 
was Michigan’s top performer, 
finishing with 13 points, eight 
rebounds — four of them offensive 
— and four blocks. The Spartans 
don’t have a player within five 
inches of the 7-foot-1 Teske, and 
this disadvantage manifested 
itself down low. Norfolk State 

had no success under the basket 
with Teske patrolling and didn’t 
experience much more away 
from it, shooting just 31 percent 
from the field.
The 
Wolverines, 
however, 
were barely better, hitting just 22 
of their 60 shot attempts, six of 
26 3-pointers and a particularly 
hideous 13-for-29 figure from the 
free-throw line.
“If you look at our numbers in 
practice and everything, just not 
happening,” Beilein said. “We 
got to just continue to work at it, 
you can’t dwell on it too much.”
In the end, though, none 
of it would matter — at least 
on Tuesday night. As soon as 
Saturday, when Michigan will 
take on Holy Cross, that might 
change.
“I’m just proud that we were 
able to gut through,” Beilein said. 
“It was a bit of a mess at times, 
but we just kept gutting through 
and gutting through, and our 
kids will see on the film how 
much better we can be when we 
play a little bit more efficiently.”

Jon Teske shows defensive prowess

Early-season non-conference 
games are often blowouts, and 
often purely due to physical 
ability. That came in the form 
of Jon Teske for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team against 
Norfolk State on Tuesday. 
All night, the Spartans (0-1) 
tried to drive into the paint, and 
all night they were met by Teske, 
who affected shot after shot as 
the Wolverines (1-0) cruised to 
a 63-44 win. Teske, whose eight 
rebounds, four blocks and steal 
buoyed a defensive effort that 
saw Norfolk State score all of 13 
first-half points, has always been 
a defensive force. This looked a 
tad different than what we’ve 
seen from him in the past.
Teske moved his feet. He 
wasn’t just tall — the 7-footer 
whose 
presence 
alone 
does 
something on defense — but agile, 
managing to affect shots, yes, but 
also hold his own on switches. He 
stayed out of foul trouble, using 

verticality in the way Michigan 
coach John Beilein has preached.
“He’s not a shot-blocker, but 
he’s a big dude to score over,” 
Beilein said. “So, if he just goes up 
there, man, that used to be a foul 
when you jumped up like that. 
And now, he’s really starting to 
understand the verticality. And I 
noticed it a couple years ago when 
I was demonstrating something 
with him and he was in front of 
me and I couldn’t see anybody. 
He’s just a big wall for us, and 
he’s using that effectively.”
When Teske got on the floor 
last year, it was often for shorter 
bursts. That was in part because 
of Moritz Wagner, part because 
of Teske getting into foul trouble 
and part because Teske simply 
got tired. 
Wagner is gone, off to the 
NBA. Teske, if Tuesday is any 
indication, is making big steps 
in terms of verticality. And 
when asked, Beilein was quick 
to note that he no longer gets 
tired, instead being able to 
play through media timeouts. 

This bodes well for a Michigan 
defense that ranked third in 
KenPom’s 
adjusted 
efficiency 
last year.
“We like his feet,” Beilein said. 
“He’s very unique for a 7-(foot)-
1 guy who has a size-13 shoe. He 
really can move his feet, so we’re 
not hesitant about switching a 
ball-screen late.”
The junior center is soft-
spoken and quick to credit 
teammates, 
the 
way 
you’re 
supposed to do. When asked 
about his assertiveness, Teske 
said that yes, he feels better in 
that area than last year, then 
added, “Austin (Davis) did that 
as well.”
But having a 7-foot-1 center 
patrolling the paint has its perks, 
especially one whose defensive 
prowess 
goes 
beyond 
being 
7-foot-1. 
“Ah man, it’s gonna change up 
their gameplan,” Isaiah Livers 
said. “They’re not gonna go after 
a 7-footer that can move his feet 
and doesn’t foul. You wouldn’t be 
a smart coach to go at Jon Teske, 
I would say.”
Indeed, the Spartans kept 
going at Teske, and it kept going 
badly. He didn’t try too hard to 
affect shots, instead walling up 
and reaping the rewards. 
The Wolverines saw on film 
that the Spartans would attack 
the paint, but it quickly became 
clear that battle was futile.
“We don’t have a 7-footer, 
so he (was) a big challenge for 
us,” Norfolk State coach Robert 
Johnson said. “So you know, we 
won’t see that much size like that 
down the road especially, even 
on non-conference opponents, 
there’s not a lot of (7-foot-1) guys 
right around that we’re gonna 
play, so it’s okay for that. It was 
good to see so hopefully things 
like that, when we play shorter 
guys we’ll be able to finish.”
On Tuesday, Norfolk State got 
no such reprieve.

“I’m just proud 
that we were 
able to gut 
through.”

‘M’ exact revenge for 
first loss to Wisconsin

It felt like one of the key 
moments of the season.
Just over a week after the No. 
14 Michigan volleyball team 
dropped a five-set heartbreaker at 
home to Wisconsin — beginning a 
three-match losing streak — the 
Wolverines came through with 
their biggest win of the season. 
Sunday, Michigan avenged its loss 
to the No. 5 Badgers in Madison, 
defeating them 25-19, 20-25, 
25-22, 25-22.
The Wolverines (19-6 overall, 
8-6 Big Ten) were led once again 
by the duo of senior outside 
hitter Carly Skjodt and freshman 
outside hitter Paige Jones. Skojdt 
had 23 kills on 56 swings resulting 
in 25.5 scoring points, and Jones 
tallied 10 kills on 46 swings for 
10.5 scoring points.
Sophomore 
middle 
blocker 
Dana Rettke paced Wisconsin (16-
6, 9-5) with 17 kills on 35 swings 
for 22.5 scoring points. Redshirt 
junior outside hitter Madison 
Duello added 16 kills on 38 swings 
for 19 scoring points.
Michigan got off to a slow 
start, dropping a first set that 
felt much worse than the score 
of 25-19 indicated. After back-to-
back disappointing performances 
versus No. 3 Minnesota and at 
Indiana, this match seemed all set 
to compound on the Wolverines’ 
recent woes.
But Michigan won the second 
set, making the third feel crucial. 
In a precarious spot down 18-22, 
the 
Wolverines 
once 
again 
mounted a startling comeback 
against the Badgers, ripping off 
seven straight points to take the 
set and momentum, 25-22.
“(Assistant Coach Leisa Rosen) 
made the adjustment, and we 
subbed in (sophomore libero 
Jaqueline) 
DiSanto 
to 
serve, 
which we hadn’t done all match,” 
said Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
“Next thing you know we had a 
five-point run (out of her). Jaq did 
a great job of putting aggressive 
serves on them, and our defense 

did a great job of stepping up and 
closing that one out.”
In contrast to their fourth-
set comeback to force a decider 
last week in Ann Arbor, the 
Wolverines made sure this one 
match wouldn’t slip away.
The fourth set was competitive 
throughout, with neither side 
leading by more than one point 
for most of the set after the 
Wolverines came back from a 
13-9 deficit to tie the score at 
13. Eventually, Michigan pulled 
ahead to finally finish Wisconsin 
off, 25-22.
Redshirt junior middle blocker 
Cori Crocker made her long-
awaited 
return 
from 
injury, 
providing a spark with four kills 
on seven swings for five scoring 
points. She also aided the defense 
with two blocks and two block 
assists — the second-most on the 
day for the Wolverines in both 
categories.
“We actually used her in the 
opposite position today, because 
we still didn’t feel that she was 
ready to move 100 percent and 
cover the range that she’d have 
to as a middle.” Rosen said. “I 
think with Cori coming back, the 
biggest thing is that it gives us 
some options, to really make some 
adjustments 
(with 
blocking). 
Allowing her to impact the other 
team with her blocking presence 
is huge.
“Hopefully within the next 
week, we’ll have her all back to 
100 percent.”
Michigan looks to continue on 
the winning track with six more 
regular season matches before the 
start of the NCAA Tournament.
“I think when you’re struggling 
a little bit, you haven’t had the 
wins, it’s definitely frustrating,” 
Rosen said. “It was a really much-
needed win today, and with sports 
and athletics, the mood (around 
the team) is constantly changing.
“I’m proud of this team for 
fighting really hard when things 
weren’t going great, and still 
finding a way to fight through that 
and keep their wits in a match like 
this.”

Michigan beats PSU in Big Ten Tournament

The Michigan men’s soccer 
team (11-4-2 overall, 4-2-2 Big 
Ten) secured a signature 3-1 
win over Penn State (6-9-2, 
3-3-2) Sunday afternoon in the 
quarterfinals of the Big Ten 
Tournament. The Wolverines 
dealt with several injuries to 
key players, including senior 
center back Daniel Mukuna, 
senior midfielder Ivo Cerda 
and 
sophomore 
forward 
Mohammed 
Zakyi. 
Zakyi 
played through a 
hamstring injury 
while the other 
two didn’t dress.
Early 
on, 
Michigan 
controlled 
the 
game, forcing all 
11 Nittany Lions 
players to defend behind the ball 
in their own half. Sophomore 
forward Umar Farouk Osman 
missed one shot and had another 
go wide before breaking through 
in the 29th minute. A long 
throw-in from the far sideline 
by senior defender Marcello 
Borges dropped to Osman, who 
buried the half-volley into the 
upper right corner.
It was a deserved goal up to 
that point for the Wolverines, 
who 
had 
a 
multitude 
of 
opportunities. Michigan looked 
poised to break the game open 
with a second goal, but junior 
forward Jack Hallahan’s close-
range shot in the 30th minute 
was blocked, followed by Borges 
missing a shot wide in the 38th 
minute.
Penn State capitalized on the 
Wolverines’ poor finishing with 
a goal that was against the run of 
play just two minutes before the 
half. Defender Ryan Gallagher 
headed the ball into the left side 
of the goal off a corner kick by 
midfielder 
Callum 
Pritchatt. 
The corner kick went over the 
attempted punch of sophomore 
goalkeeper Henry Mashburn, 
leaving a wide open net for the 
Nittany Lions to tie up the game.
“Physically, they’re strong, 

they’re 
fit. 
Two, 
they’re 
organized, very well coached,” 
said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. “And three, they’re super 
dangerous in every dead ball 
situation. As a result of that it 
makes it a difficult game.”
It was a frustrating end to the 
half for Michigan, who outshot 
Penn State seven to four before 
the break.
“Yeah, I mean, I think we told 
the guys we missed some passes 
we 
could 
have 
connected,” 
Daley said.“We 
missed chances 
we should have 
taken 
— 
you 
know 
what 
I 
mean — a couple 
half-chances 
we could have 
worked 
the 
keeper a little 
bit more.
“And 
we 
mismanaged 
the game. With three minutes to 
go in the half, the ball is down 
there, we just gotta clear our 
lines a little bit and not overplay 
or have us be too overconfident 
in those situations. You try to 
play out or rally and shield it in 
the corner, and unfortunately it 
didn’t go our way, and they took 
full advantage.”
The 
second 
half 
was 

strikingly more physical. Both 
teams had a player who had 
to leave the game due to blood 
being drawn. The physicality 
came to a head with a yellow 
card issued to the Nittany Lions’ 
Pritchatt for a blatant foul in the 
50th minute.
The Wolverines took back 
control of the match, earning 
three corner kicks, one of which 
was converted by Osman for his 
second of the game. The corner 
was taken by Hallahan and 
flicked by senior 
midfielder Robbie 
Mertz to Osman, 
who left no doubt 
by firing another 
half-volley 
into 
the 
upper 
left 
corner.
“We gotta take 
our 
chances. 
That’s 
what 
(Daley) 
told 
us 
because we got a 
lot of chances in the first half,” 
Osman said. “We just couldn’t 
execute, so we needed to focus 
and we did that.”
The first three goals of the 
game all came off dead-ball 
situations.
“I mean, if you look at the 
statistics of soccer just in 
general most goals happen in 
the first ten minutes or last ten 

of halves typically, and a large 
percentage of them come off of 
set pieces or dead ball situations. 
So the statistics are proven,” 
Daley said. “We focus on them 
before every game. We discuss 
them before every game before 
and at half. And so we’re hyper-
focused I guess when it comes to 
those situations and fortunately 
today they went in our favor.”
Michigan 
continued 
its 
command of the game, ending 
with a 12-4 advantage in shots. 
However, 
the 
game was far 
from 
over 
until Hallahan 
settled 
the 
contest with a 
goal in the 81st 
minute. Junior 
forward Lucas 
Rosendall 
passed the ball 
inside the box 
to 
Hallahan, 
who drove the ball into the 
lower left corner. The goal 
gave the Wolverines a lead they 
wouldn’t relinquish.
“It was a very huge win 
for us, because we didn’t beat 
them earlier (this season),” said 
Osman. “And before the game, 
our coaches told us this might be 
our last game, so we made sure 
it wasn’t.”

Charting the politics of Michigan

2016 ELECTION


H

ad 
I 
owned 
a 

laptop 
in 
early 

high 
school, 
I 

probably would’ve had one 
of those text bubble “*you’re” 
stickers smugly displayed on 
it, announcing to the world 
how grammatically superior 
I was to those who dared 
to write “your welcome.” 

Luckily, I didn’t have a 
laptop, and luckily, my view 
of grammar has changed 
since then.

Grammar has always been 

something I thought was 
both fun and important, 
particularly 
as 
someone 

who considers themselves 
detail-oriented. 
Having 

parents 
who 
routinely 

pointed 
out 
misplaced 

apostrophes 
or 
quotation 

marks on signs and menus, I 
became a grammar stickler 
myself 
and 
had 
proudly 

written my first email to Ford 
Motor Company criticizing 
their use of the phrase “less 
stops” 
[COPY: 
fewer] 
in 

one of their commercials 
by age 13. A source of 
pride for me became my 
knowledge of language and 
grammatical 
structure, 

from 
understanding 
the 

difference 
between 
a 

subject and a direct object to 
noticing dangling modifiers 
and misused commas.

However, I have also 

become a lover of shorthand 
texting. In my everyday 
communications, 
I 
often 

don’t have to worry about 

the 
difference 

between “your” and 
“you’re” 
because 

I have come to 
replace them both 

with 
“ur,” 
and 
I 

now find myself even 

avoiding 
grammatically 

correct structures to be 

more casual with my 

friends. 
It 
would 

seem that my love 

for 
“correct” 

grammar 
and 

disdain for those 

who 
didn’t 
use 

it 
would 
contradict 

my frequent use of 
shortened words and 
texting 
acronyms, 

which 
raises 
a 

question: How could I 
reconcile loving both?

The 
answer, 
I 

found, 
is 
that 
both 

styles 
are 
valuable 

because of their ability 
to accurately convey 
information, regardless 
of 
whether 
they’re 

recognized 
as 
“standard” 

or 
not. 
After 
taking 
a 

cultural 
linguistics 
class, 

I realized that language, 
and 
more 
specifically, 

grammar, exists to allow for 
effective 
communication 

between people, and really, 
its only failure is if it’s not 
understandable. As long as 
I write with a consistent 
style to someone, even if it’s 
not standard English, my 
grammar is doing its job. 
For instance, my friends 

are accustomed to my use 
of “lmao wtf” and “rn,” and 
therefore 
my 
shorthand 

style is perfectly acceptable 
for that context, as long as 
I don’t change the meaning 
of these acronyms without 
telling them.

At The Michigan Daily, 

we use our standardized 
stylebook 
for 
the 
same 

reason: We want our writing 
to be understood. Largely 
based on AP Style, The 
Daily 
Stylebook 
follows 

grammatical 
guidelines 

similar to the ones many 
other newspapers use, as this 
uniformity allows readers 
to understand us, while also 
making sure our paper looks 
precise 
and 
professional. 

While many probably think 
copy editors’ nitpicking and 
subtle changes are largely 
inconsequential, 
using 

the same style for every 
piece 
allows 
for 
clarity 

of our writers’ messages. 
For example, we use “the 
University,” with a capital 
U, to refer to the University 
of 
Michigan 
on 
second 

reference. If we were to edit 
an article that discussed 
“the struggles of a university 
student,” there would be an 
important difference if we 
capitalized the U, as it would 
change the meaning from 
“the struggles of a college 

student” to “the struggles 
of a University of Michigan 
student.” 
If 
we 
started 

capitalizing 
“university” 

arbitrarily, 
the 
intended 

meaning from our writer 
would be lost.

The importance of our 

style, I believe, is not that 
it is standard English, but 
that its uniformity conveys 
the correct meaning of our 
writers’ 
words. 
Realizing 

this is true with all styles 
of speaking and writing, 
whether lingo or standard 
English, has allowed me to 
still do what I love to do: pay 
attention to small details. 
Now, luckily, I do it to make 
sure I understand or convey 
the 
precise 
meaning 
of 

something, and not simply 
to show off my grammatical 
dominance via laptop sticker.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 7, 2018


I

n the spring of 2016, I voted for Sen. 
Bernie Sanders in the Democratic 
primary for president. I’d gone to 

a rally that March, and Sanders had said 
things I’d never heard any politician say. He 
wanted to give Americans universal health 
care, economic equality, affordable college 
education, a more sustainable economy and 
easier access to reproductive health services. 
When I recall my excitement at these 
endeavors — and his — I feel the frustrated, 
pointless burn of misplaced naivete.

The future I imagined through him is so 

very different than the one I live in now.

Even though Sanders lost the Democratic 

primary in June 2016, I was still excited to 
vote in the presidential election. I thought 
that when I voted for former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton, I would be voting for 
America’s first woman president. Besides, 
the fact that Sanders made it all the way to 
the primary felt like an omen of a coming 
progressive wave. This was the world my 
friends and I lived in: one where experts 
told us it was very likely a woman would be 
our next president, one where truth and 
democracy seemed possible even when they 
failed to create justice.

On Nov. 8, 2016, I voted in Palmer Commons 

and immediately texted my mother. She sent 
me a selfie with an “I voted” sticker on her 
forehead. I promised to call her later that 
night so we could celebrate together. My mom 
was one of the 6,972 people in Emmet County 
who voted for Hillary Clinton. 10,616 cast 
their ballot for Donald Trump. Michigan — 
like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — would go 
Republican for the first time since the 1980s.

As I walked through the Diag to my 

Sociology exam on Nov. 9, 2016, I tried not 
to let my mind wander away from Trump’s 
win. Later, my professor projected Hillary 
Clinton’s concession speech live in my history 
class. It seemed to mark the magnitude of 
the occasion. We were unashamed to cry 
with one another. A girl who had defended 
Trump during a class discussion the week 
before excused herself to the bathroom for 
a long time. When she returned, she looked 
embarrassed and only a little smug. I almost 
felt guilty that she was excluded from our 
collective grief. 

As college students, national politics are at 

once distant and immediate. From the protest 
of the Vietnam War at Kent State University 
to the anti-Apartheid demonstrations at 
Harvard University and Wesleyan College, 
college campuses have always been hotbeds of 
political and social anxiety. Protests centered 
on individual issues — U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement, Israel-Palestine, 
Brett Kavanaugh — still abound at the 
University. But many of the anxieties that 
have accompanied the Trump administration 
are difficult to understand and articulate, 
much less protest against effectively. What 
good would it do to march around Ann Arbor 
with signs decrying Russian collusion? To 

chant in the Diag about nepotism in Trump’s 
White House? The menace of the Trump 
administration vacillates between insidiously 
subtle and glaringly apparent, and students 
are coping with this uncertainty in a number 
of ways.

College culture has become self-conscious, 

half-ironic hedonism: Juuling and throwing 
away Juuls, binge-drinking but fetishizing 
health food, using Tinder for meaningless 
hookups while also secretly hoping to find 
love. We want immediate pleasure because 
things seem so bad right now, but we’re not 
ready to abandon a future that doesn’t require 
indulging in these temporary escapes.

Two years after the 2016 election, my 

classmates and I are living in the world that 
many of us feared. I am trying to remember 
a time when there wasn’t an endless barrage 
of news every day –– news that only serves 
as a reminder of how deeply bizarre and 
unbearably tragic Trump’s America is. For 
college students like myself, it’s hard to 
remember anything else. I’ve been having 
an unsettling sense of déjà vu this semester. 
Just as they did during the first semester of 
my freshman year, everyone is talking about 
voting. It’s making me think about how the 
world has changed over the past two years, 
and about how college is both a protection 
against, and a microcosm of, our country’s 
anxieties.

I’ve been wondering recently: Was I just 

guileless before the 2016 election? I know now 
that I entered college lulled to complacency by 
a false hope and security. As a white person, I 
recognize that America has always felt much 
safer for me than it has for people who hold 
minority identities. Still, I think it was more 
than youthful ignorance, white privilege and 
economic security that made the world seem 
so different two years ago. This is why I’m 
struggling to reconcile the near-immediate 
impact of the election on my sense of America 
and of the world.

Has everything always been so hateful and 

violent? Have people always been so cruel and 
selfish?

Sometimes my friends and I play a game 

where we name everything we are worried 
about. We start small and then we work 
our way out, and out, and out. This makes 
the scope and depth of our fears feel almost 
comical. It’s much worse to let the specter of 
our anxieties remain private.

Many of my friends share my identities: 

white, woman, middle-class, heterosexual. 
These majority identities protect us. Like 
numerous students at the University, I do not 
face immediate bodily harm from some of the 
things I am afraid of. At a university whose 
student body is majority white and wealthy, 
there’s a striking disconnect between anxiety 
and tangible impact.

There is a pervading sense on campus — 

among students as well as professors — that 

we are living in an unprecedented time, no 
matter what identities we hold. People are 
constantly making broad reference to the 
news or what’s been going on recently. They 
never need to explain. We all know. We are all 
worried.

What are we worried about? We are 

worried about our exam next week. We are 
worried about paying off our student loans. 
We are worried about getting a job when we 
graduate and about leaving the warm bubble 
of college. We are worried about being shot in 
our classrooms before we even have a chance 
to leave. We are worried about being shot in 
our synagogues and in our churches and in 
our newsrooms and at the movies and at the 
grocery store and in the street. We are worried 
about not being able to get birth control or a 
legal abortion, about being sexually assaulted 
and having our attacker walk free.

We are worried the National Guard will 

fire at the migrant caravan. We are worried 
Trump will issue an executive order to negate 
the birthright clause. We are worried about 
private prisons and nuclear weapons and 
Flint’s water and gerrymandering and voter 
fraud and Russian meddling in the 2016 
election. We are worried about antibiotic 
resistance, PFAS, the UN Climate Report, 
Monsanto and the Sixth Mass Extinction.

Most of all, we are worried that as bad as 

things seem now, we will remember these 
years as the final ones of a dying country and 
a dying world. We are worried that right now 
is when we still had time to act — that these 
are the days and months when we could have 
saved ourselves and yet did not.

Of course, these issues did not begin when 

Trump was inaugurated, and many of them 
have nothing to do with him. Somehow, 
though, they feel connected. The past 18 
months have been struck through with a 
particularly forbidden thrill. There is an 
urgent, awful specialness to being young right 
now. The threat of all-out chaos permeates 
everything, giving each day an aura of tense 
hyperreality.

For college students, it’s tempting to be 

cynical — especially while we’re still on 
campus and shielded, to some extent, by 
the distraction of classes, social lives and 
extracurriculars. It’s much more painful 
to devote ourselves to speaking out against 
what we deplore and still falling short. The 
amputation is far easier if we say we never 
cared about the limb in the first place, that 
it was gangrened and rotted long before 
we tried to save it. What is the limb in this 
metaphor — our rights? Our planet? Our 
future? I don’t know.

I think there are two ways to cope with 

the frantic anxiety of our time: numbing 
ourselves against the fear or trying to live 
with it somehow. I want to say — like we all 
do — that I’m choosing the latter option. I’m 
really trying. It’s just so much harder than I 
thought it would be.

Charting the politics 
of Michigan

Design by Willa Hua | Analysis by Robert Lesser | Written by Brian Kuang

An election is nothing more than a snapshot of the electorate at a given time. Nevertheless, 
the results of the 2018 midterm elections in Michigan help form a wider story of the shifting 
political sands of the state and the nation. To help conceptualize today’s election results, the 
Statement Magazine has charted out how Michigan’s political map has shifted in three pivotal 
elections and how control of local and statewide offices has changed beginning in 2000.

The Obama Coalition

Though Republicans had early hope for contesting 
Michigan, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., ultimately 
had a decisive win in the state, beating Sen. 
John McCain, R-Ariz, by nearly 17 percentage 
points. In his victory, Obama carried not only 
historically Democratic areas, but also swept many 
predominantly white, working-class areas in rural 
and Upper Peninsula counties. The turnout of 
the voting age population for the election was 66 
percent — almost four percent higher than the 
national rate and eight percent higher than 2000. 

Republican businessman Donald Trump took the 
nation by surprise by narrowly winning many 
Midwestern states, including Michigan where 
he beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
by 11,000 votes out of 4.8 million votes that 
were cast in the state. Trump’s victory was built 
on flipping historically Democratic industrial 
strongholds in regions such as Macomb, Saginaw 
and Bay counties — many of which had voted for 
Obama only recently — and relatively weak voter 
enthusiasm in Detroit. Clinton had a relatively 
strong showing in upscale and educated areas 
such as Ann Arbor, but this was not enough 
to overcome Democrats’ historically weak 
performance in Michigan’s rural areas.

Bush v. Gore 

Amid a close national race where Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush ultimately prevailed, Vice 
President Al Gore edged out Bush in Michigan by 
five percentage points. Gore’s victory in the state 
was powered by strong margins out of Detroit, 
and traditionally-Democratic industrial and rural 
areas largely on the east side of the state, including 
Macomb County. On the same night U.S. Rep. 
Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., beat incumbent Sen. 
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., for Michigan’s Senate 
seat by two percentage points in a much closer 
race. Democrats retained control over Michigan’s 
seats in the House — holding 10 out of 16 seats.

o you guys want to hang 
Saturday 
night?” 
I 
text 

some 
guys 
I 
met 
dur-

ing 
Welcome 
Week, 
the 

October 
of 
my 
freshman 
year.

“Sorry, we have to be at our frat party,” 

the reply reads. I already know I’m prob-
ably not getting in, as me being a guy 
would mess up the “ratio” of their party.

Next, 
I 
text 
some 
friends 
from 

home, firing off the same message, 
and a few minutes later my phone 
buzzes again with the same response.

“Sorry, 
we’re 
planning 
on 

going 
out 
to 
some 
frat 
parties.”

This scenario is what I went through 

from September until the beginning of 
March — the majority of my freshman year. 
I’d decided not to rush a fraternity during 
the first month of my freshman year, get-
ting cold feet and sensing I wouldn’t be 
able to fit in. This led to a feeling of exclu-
sion and as a freshman dropped in a new 
environment, it was difficult to cope with.

After a couple months of sitting alone 

in my dorm room on Saturday nights, I 
decided to go down the hall and start a 
conversation with the other people who 
were spending their weekends in the 
dorm because they too weren’t in Greek 
life. That was the point when I started 
to break out of my shell and realize there 
are other ways to enjoy the weekend that 
didn’t involve fraternity parties. And even 
though I may not be friends with most of 
these people from the dorm this year, I 
believe that the initiative I took to start 
conversations in the dorm allowed me to 

step out of my comfort zone and it made 
me feel like I was one step closer to finding 
my place at the University of Michigan.

I had come to realize there are many 

different directions to find a community 
at the University. When starting at the 
University of Michigan, I thought Greek 
life was a common thing that a majority of 
students did, while only about 18 percent 
of undergraduates actually are involved. 
There are other ways for me to make the 
most of my college experience and enjoy 
my time at the University that don’t involve 
having to shotgun a beer in a small, sweaty 
basement in order to impress my friends.

Instead of feeling sorry for myself 

and worrying about what I was going to 
do each weekend, I could stop compar-
ing myself to the people who are out at 
parties with their new group of close 
friends. Most people, myself included, 
don’t become best friends with some-
one the instant they meet them. It seems 
that when you become part of a frater-
nity, you are immediately immersed in a 
community of people who you know you 
will be spending the majority of your 
time in college with. But building friend-
ships took time for me, and eventually, I 
was able to find a community of my own.

Even though it didn’t happen in the 

first couple of weeks, I can say that dur-
ing my second semester I finally found 
my community at the University. And 
that community is the amazing people 
at 420 Maynard St. that spend their 
time working for The Michigan Daily.

I remember walking into a mass meet-

ing as a nervous freshman who wanted to 
get more involved with photography on 
campus. Once I joined the Photo section, I 
began to come in on a weekly basis to work 
at The Daily for production. Each time I 
came in, I spoke to more people. In the 
beginning, it was just other photographers 
who were around me doing similar things. 
As time went on, I began interacting with 
people not only who take pictures for The 
Daily, but also people from other sections 
too, such as Sports, Design and News.

Meeting these people — from fellow 

photographers 
to 
basketball-addicted 

sports writers — is really what allowed me 
to feel part of a community, and perhaps 
form a fraternity of my own. According to 
the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the def-
inition of a fraternity is “a group of peo-
ple associated or formally organized for a 
common purpose, interest, or pleasure.” 
In a way, I realized that I can still be part 
of a fraternity, even if it’s not the stereo-
typical fraternity I initially think of. The 
people of The Daily are always there for 
me when I need it, whether that be with 
academics or not. And I know that the 
building at 420 Maynard can be a place 
to go during both good days and bad days.

Still, from time to time during my soph-

omore year, I am reminded of the fact that 
I am not in a fraternity as I occasionally 
find myself alone on the weekends, look-
ing for people to be with. When I do find 
myself alone, needing someone to talk to 
or do something to ease the stress of col-
lege, I know that I can go to 420 Maynard 
and the people of The Daily will be there.

Finding a community of my own

hile 
at 

times it 
seems 

that we are living 
a 
political 
farce, 

President 
Donald 

Trump’s 
admin-

istration is not an 
exaggerated 
the-

atrical 
mockery 

of politics. It is 
the overt and vio-
lent manifestation 
and expansion of 
American 
imperi-

alism. What is hap-
pening south of the 
U.S.-Mexico border 
— the approaching 
caravan of migrants 
— is a direct con-
sequence 
of 
this 

historical 
legacy.

Though the mid-

term elections are 
often written off 
as 
inconsequen-

tial, the outcomes 
of this election say 
much more about 

the future of the country than before.

American imperialism can be succinct-

ly defined as policies enacted to expand 
American dominion — whether political, 
economic or cultural — beyond its geo-
graphic boundaries. Throughout its his-
tory, American imperialism has come about 
through economic engagement both by way 
of private means, government treaties, mil-

itary interventions or 
regime changes. While 
this is talked about as 
a historical issue, the 
consequences of impe-
rialism 
are 
present 
today.

Central and Latin 

America 
are 
not 

strangers 
to 
these 

political 
interven-

tions. The 1960s repre-
sented an era of social 
hope 
where 
major 

civil wars and com-
munist 
revolutions 

exploded in the Southern Hemisphere.

As a result, the 1980s, under Ronald 

Reagan’s neoliberal agenda with Henry 
Kissinger’s geopolitical games from the 
preceding decades, marked an era of con-
servative backlash. In an attempt to contain 
communist expansion, the United States, 
through its seemingly unlimited resources, 
pushed its interests through puppet govern-

ments and military-backed dissidents. This 
created a growing political divide in Cen-
tral America. Nicaragua, El Salvador, Gua-
temala and Honduras would all be directly 
affected. Today, the legacy of these inter-
ventions are most clearly seen in the privati-
zation of state enterprises, changes in labor 
rights laws, neoliberal trade reforms and 
the overall liberalization of “democracy.”

The 
imposed 
political 
transforma-

tions have left in their wake the dis-
placement 
and 
destruction 
of 
entire 

communities. 
American 
intervention 

has left these countries unable to rec-
oncile the political divide and they are 
crumbling under a neoliberal banner.

The approaching migrant caravan is 

the loud rumbling of this past. Thou-
sands of migrants are embarking on a 
dangerous journey to escape the conse-
quences of American imperialism. They 
are fighting poverty and violence. As they 
travel, they face the dangers of human 
trafficking, 
dehydration, 
starvation 

and death — all for an uncertain future.

As Trump send troops south — mili-

tarizing the border — he further proves 
his ignorance of the country’s historical 
legacy. He uses military power to make 
a political statement — a statement that 
lacks reflection. His comments highlight 
a collective unconscious that has failed to 
problematize the question of America in 
the world. His actions, using the military 
for political gain, as well as his comments, 
reveal the dark and racist underbelly 
of America. He is bolstering an angry 
white constituency that is blind to reality.

However, Trump has made one cru-

cial mistake: People have the ability to 
see through his actions and recognize 
the bigotry behind his words. In these 
turbulent times, the ability to think 
and reflect is our greatest strength.

So as people lined up at the polls, their 

vote was no longer just about healthcare, 
reproductive rights, or tax laws. Their vote 
now represents a shout that we will not tol-
erate the ignorance and blatant violence 
against people who represent the very 
consequence of American intervention. As 
Americans, we have an obligation to under-
stand and question the prevailing history of 
our interventions as they affect the world 
at large. Only by engaging in these con-
versations can we make sure that politi-
cians don’t use generalizations to justify 
their means. Yesterday it was at the polls 
— tomorrow it will be at the dinner table, 
making sure this history is not forgotten. 
This is the only way to live up to the image 
and promise of America as a land of hope.
