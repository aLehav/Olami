The University of Michigan 
is freezing its fossil fuel 
investments — for the time 
being. 
On 
Thursday 
evening, 
during 
the 
University’s 
Board of Regents meeting 
at the Richard L. Postma 
Family Clubhouse, University 
Regent Mark Bernstein (D) 
announced 
the 
board 
is 
looking into the University’s 
policy 
on 
investments 
in 
fossil fuel companies. New 
investments will not occur 

during this time.
“We will not bring forward 
new direct investments in 
fossil fuel companies while we 
study the investment policy 
of the University of Michigan 
with regard to all fossil fuel 
investments in a deliberative, 
thorough, 
inclusive, 
and 
responsible 
manner,” 
Bernstein 
said. 
“We 
will 
proceed with this assessment 
as quickly as possible and 
plan to take any appropriate 
actions in the months ahead.”
After 
Bernstein’s 
announcement, the audience 
immediately 
erupted 
in 

applause. The University is 
the first Big Ten school to 
pause future investments in 
fossil fuel companies.
Approximately 
80 
University 
students 
and 
faculty 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
community 
members 
were 
in attendance to observe the 
meeting. University Regent 
Shauna Ryder Diggs (D) called 
into the meeting from a remote 
location. Acting Provost Susan 
Collins was also present.
University President Mark 
Schlissel took the beginning 
of the meeting to comment 
on 
recent 
allegations 
of 

sexual misconduct that have 
surfaced against prominent 
University 
administrators. 
He encouraged students and 
faculty who were disturbed 
by the allegations to utilize 
University 
resources 
and 
continue supporting those who 
come forward with allegations 
of sexual misconduct.
After 
Schlissel 
said 
he 
condemned 
all 
instances 
of 
sexual 
misconduct, 
an 
audience member interrupted 
his speech, shouting, “You 
knew!” 

The 
campaign 
office 
for 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders 
(D-VT) opened on Stadium 
Boulevard 
in 
Ann 
Arbor 
Thursday 
night. 
The 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate’s event drew more 
than 150 local supporters 
and featured guest speakers 
former 
gubernatorial 
candidate Abdul El-Sayed 
and state Rep. Yousef Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor. 
Sanders 
endorsed 
El-Sayed’s 
campaign 
for 
governor 
in 
2018, 
and 
El-Sayed 
has 
expressed 
his 
support 
for 
Sanders’ 
presidential campaign. 
El-Sayed 
said 
Sanders’ 
consistent beliefs on issues 
like health care and the 
environment resonated with 
him the most. 
“Let me tell you why I am 
so excited to be out here for 
Bernie right now,” El-Sayed 
said. “It’s not just that Bernie 
is the frontrunner among 
candidates for president of 
the United States, it’s that 
Bernie has been talking about 
these issues since before I 
was born; it’s the recognition 
of the kind of policies that 
we need, but even more than 

that, the kind of politics that 
it will take to get it done.”
El-Sayed 
concluded 
his 
remarks 
by 
connecting 
Sanders’ campaign slogan 
“Not 
me. 
Us.” 
to 
the 
Constitution of the United 
States. 
“It goes back to those first 
three words ‘We the People.’ 
That’s not just a statement, 
that’s not just a description, 
it’s 
an 
ideal 
of 
people 
continuously 
choosing 
to 
come together beyond the 
differences that people tell 
them divide them,” El - Sayed 
said. “‘Not me. Us’ is about 
‘We the People,’ it’s about us 
coming together in the best 
interests of our society.”
Rabhi 
shared 
his 
excitement 
for 
Sanders’ 
campaign and vision for the 
United States, especially on 
health care. 
“I am proud to be here with 
so many fantastic people 
to fight for someone who is 
running, not just one person, 
but all of us,” said Rabhi. “To 
fight for an idea that we can 
create a healthcare system 
that leaves more money in 
our pockets and less money 
in the pockets of greedy 
CEOs.”

When 
LSA 
freshman 
Hannah 
Shipley 
started 
learning more about the deaf and 
hard of hearing communities 
in her first-year seminar, her 
interest in taking American 
Sign Language courses piqued. 
Upon further research, Shipley 
found out about the waitlist of 
more than 100 LSA students for 
RCASL 100, the ASL language 
sequence’s prerequisite course, 
which could block her from 
taking any further courses for 
two years. 
After 
speaking 
with 
her 
linguistics professor, Natasha 

Abner, Shipley started a petition 
in hopes of increasing the 
opportunity to learn ASL at the 
University of Michigan for both 
the deaf and hard of hearing 
communities and her hearing 
classmates. 
“She explained to me how 
small the program was, that 
there’s 
only 
one 
professor, 
that the Intro is only offered 
every other year and that the 
waiting list is so long that some 
graduating seniors will never 
get it,” Shipley said. “I was 
really frustrated … The only 
thing that came to mind was the 
petition. So really it started out 
of frustration that a program 
for a community that’s so 

marginalized is so small.” 
According to the University’s 
ASL professor, Paula Berwanger, 
ASL 100 consistently has a 
waitlist of more than 100 LSA 
students in addition to more 
than 20 students from other 
schools across campus.
In RCASL 100, Introduction 
to Deaf Culture, students do not 
learn ASL; rather, they learn 
about deaf culture in the United 
States, deaf identity and the 
historical roots of the language. 
After completing RCASL 100, 
students 
are 
permitted 
to 
continue on to elementary and 
intermediate 
sign 
language 
courses. 
Because all students still 

have to take ASL 100, those who 
place into ASL 102 or further 
get precedence in registering 
for 
ASL 
100. 
Additionally, 
Berwanger wrote in an email 
to The Daily that students who 
are deaf, hard of hearing or 
who have immediate family 
members 
using 
ASL 
get 
preference. LSA students are 
also shown preference. 
“As 
more 
high 
schools 
now offer ASL, the number 
of students testing into ASL 
beyond 
the 
first-semester 
language class has steadily 
increased,” Berwanger wrote.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
NCAA 

Division I standing and 
Big 
Ten 
membership 
provide 
students 
on 
campus with a source 
of spirit. However, not 
all athletes on campus 
compete at the varsity 
level. Many students find 
their desire to compete 
athletically fulfilled by 
membership to club or 
intramural sports teams, 
which 
are 
primarily 
student-based 
and 
organized. 
To achieve club status, a 
team must apply through 
the 
University’s 
Club 
Sports 
Office. 
Before 
this process can occur, 
the Club Sports Program 
must assess their ability 
to add more teams. 
Laurel Hanna, assistant 
director of Club Sports, 
explained how the Club 
Sports Program decides 
to open up more spots for 
student organizations to 
achieve club status.

Amid the usual bustling activity 
in Mason Hall, more than 200 
University of Michigan graduate 
student instructors lined the walls 
on Tuesday afternoon to display the 
labor of graduate student workers. 
The demonstration comes on the 
heels of the University’s multiple 
rejections to contract proposals 
from the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization.
GEO began contract negotiations 
with the University administration 
last November. The organization 
met 
with 
University 
Human 
Resources twice a week for a few 
hours to introduce proposals and 
language crucial to the bargaining 
process.
GEO’s initial bargaining with HR 
resulted in productive developments 
on expanding trans health care 
access and building union security, 
according to GEO’s press release. 
However, GEO’s frustration with 
the University’s administration is 
due to HR’s rejections — with no 
counteroffers — of proposals related 
to climate, housing and food justice, 
a demilitarized workplace, disability 
and mental health accommodations 
and protections against sexual 
assault. 
Both 
GEO 
and 
HR 
have agreed to reach a tentative 
agreement by Mar. 1, 2020.

The University of Michigan’s 
brand new Center for Ethics, 
Society 
and 
Computing 
opened in January with the 
goal of addressing inequality 
produced by digital media and 
computing technology. With 
the prevalence of computing 
technology across almost every 
professional field and modern, 
everyday life, the potential for 
inequity and exclusion exists 
across many disciplines. The 
center aims to use University 
resources to better understand 
this and educate people. 
ESC 
Director 
Christian 
Sandvig, 
associate 
communications 
professor, 
highlighted 
the 
need 
for 
organizations 
like 
ESC, 
especially given how rapidly the 
use of computing has grown.
“Generally speaking, there’s 
a moment at which we as a 
society are reflecting about 
advances 
in 
computing,” 
Sandvig said. “Computers are 
doing these things that they 
never before did, and they’re 
definitely good at things we 
didn’t think they would be 
good at, but they’re often being 

rushed into situations where 
there hasn’t been necessarily 
a lot of thought about some 
of the implications or the 
consequences, and sometimes 
the designs are rushed.”
Recently, interest in ethical 
computing has been on the rise 
as algorithms are implemented 
in everything from deciding 
bail rates in our justice system 
to credit scores and social 
media feeds. Sandvig discussed 
the breadth of this new center, 
emphasizing that prior to its 
launch the University had no 
centralized 
resource 
issues 
related to this new and evolving 
field or students interested in it. 
“If you were interested in, for 
example, the ethics of working 
for different companies in the 
tech industry or interested in 
issues of justice and fairness and 
computing or mass surveillance, 
it wasn’t really clear where 
the community was, so our job 
we think is to answer that,” 
Sandvig said. “We have faculty 
from art, we have faculty from 
architecture, 
music, 
LSA, 
information, public health, it’s 
a pretty broad group of people 
and they’re all interested in 
these problems of computers in 
society.”

The center aims to be a 
research 
hub 
focused 
on 
understanding 
computing 
inequalities. 
For 
example, 
Sandvig brought up a past 
research project in which he 
and a group of students tried 
to determine why a Facebook 
algorithm provided the option 
of a gay pride flag emoji reaction 
to only some users during June 
of 2017.
“It’s pretty interesting that 
Facebook thinks that it should 
be, 
probably 
algorithmically, 
profiling 
your 
support 
for 
homosexuality,” Sandvig said. 
“We tried to reverse engineer 
how Facebook was deciding 
where to deploy the gay pride 
emoji.”
Sandvig said the University 
provided 
ESC 
with 
an 
opportunity to address these 
issues with multidisciplinary 
efforts and fill this unique gap. 
“Michigan 
is 
really 
remarkable in that it has a really 
large group of faculty that are 
experts in areas relating to 
computers, but also to justice, or 
fairness, or ethics or morality,” 
Sandvig said. “The idea was, 
what if we are able to showcase 
our University’s strength in 
this area by organizing all of 

the professor’s together and 
to try and form a community 
around the students that are 
interested in this area.”
Art 
& 
Design 
assistant 
professor Sophia Brueckner, 
former 
Google 
software 
engineer, does research with 
ESC that focuses on people’s 
perspectives 
regarding 
the 
role of technology in the 
future, both good and bad. She 
does this partly by analyzing 
and studying science fiction, 
using a variety of mediums to 
showcase her findings.
“Often I find myself thinking 
about what visions of the future 
are 
industry 
offering 
us?” 
Brueckner said. “Everything 
right now seems to be free 
but really we’re paying for it 
with our attention and our 
data, and that’s what’s shaping 
the trajectory of a lot of these 
technologies, 
in 
particular 
wearable 
technologies 
and 
most internet technologies. If 
we weren’t constrained by that 
what might be a person’s vision 
for how they might live with 
technology or incorporate it in 
their body be?”

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind-the-scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA sophomore Callie 
Teitelbaum on her story “Students protest Paul, Weiss recruiting 
event in support of #DropExxon”:

“When I was assigned the story I immediately started researching 
Paul, Weiss’ relationship with Exxon and reading about different 
lawsuits Paul Weiss defended Exxon in. I interviewed a participant 
and organizer of the protest prior to the event to understand why law 
students around the country are taking a risk in boycotting one of the 
most competitive law firms. I also wanted to understand why this 
battle against Exxon is one law students are particularly passionate 
about. After witnessing the protest, I combined my research of past 
Exxon controversy with the message from law students to Paul Weiss 
to paint a picture of why this national movement is occurring at other 
law schools, and why law students are using this time to take a stand….
The most interesting part of the story is how law students are using 
their power in the process of recruiting to take a stand on climate 
change. The extent to which Exxon’s historical role in climate change 
is causing law students to question the ethics of different law firms is 
extremely interesting.”

Rabhi said Sanders’ health 
care policies would lead to more 
comprehensive 
coverage 
for 
Americans. 
“Too many Americans have 
died because they do not have 
healthcare or they lack adequate 
access to healthcare,” Rabbi said. 
“How many more will we allow 
to die? Not a single one under a 
Bernie presidency.”
Rabhi closed by commenting 
on 
his 
own 
experiences 
in 

government and said he trusts 
Sanders’ judgment to do the right 
thing. 
“One of the things that I 
like about this campaign is as 
someone who has been in the 
hot seat, somebody who has seen 
in the bullpen how things work 
in politics, I can tell you that 
just about every day I am truly 
disgusted that our American 
political system has become what 
it has,” Rabhi said. “They say that 
money influences policy… but I 
have seen it firsthand. And what 
I like about Bernie Sanders and 
this campaign, is that there is no 

monied interest, no corporation 
that he puts first.” 
Medical 
School 
student 
Solomon 
Rajput, 
who 
is 
challenging U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Mich, spoke to The 
Daily about his excitement for 
Sanders’ campaign.
“I am so excited to support 
and endorse Bernie Sanders for 
president of the United States. 
He’s the man with a vision,” 
Rajput said. “He knows what 
we need to get done to improve 
the lives of the regular people in 
America and we’re going to stick it 
to the rich.” 

LSA freshman Porter Hughes, 
a member of Students for Bernie 
at the University of Michigan, said 
he hopes to see the office as the 
beginning of a surge of support for 
Sanders in the coming months. 
“This field office is just one piece 
of the giant grassroots network 
that Bernie Sanders is building 
to help start a movement to not 
only get him elected President but 
change the politics that are in our 
country,” Hughes said. “There are 
so many issues that people are 
passionate about, and they are 
ready to make a change. Bernie 
is that change.”


GEO President Emily Gauld, a 
Rackham student, spoke to The 
Daily before the grade-in and 
described GEO’s disappointment 
with the University’s rejection of 
proposals for promoting equitable 
and accessible working conditions.
“We spent many hours answering 
questions about the language and 
trying to start problem-solving,” 
Gauld said. “They were really 
trying to understand the root of 
the problem we were getting at, 
we were trying to articulate that as 
clearly as possible. We were hoping 
their counters would provide us 
with some sense of how they saw 
we could address the problem or 
where they could meet us in the 
middle. And to get rejections on 
everything felt like all of those 
conversations 
were 
essentially 
wasted.”
In an interview with The Daily 
in Dec. 2019, University President 
Mark Schlissel said he values 
unions and believes in negotiating 
to find reasonable solutions all 
parties are satisfied with. 
“What 
unions 
do 
with 
employers 
is 
they 
negotiate,” 
Schlissel said. “So demands aren’t 
negotiation — they say ’you must 
do this.’ The idea is to spend time 
understanding each others’ goals 
and figuring out which ones are 
the most important, since no one 
ever gets everything they want in a 
negotiation, and then you sit down 
and work. And it’s hard work. And 
they’ll meet a couple of times a 
week for many months trying to 
figure out what’s a win-win. There 
are some things GEO is going to 
want that they just aren’t going to 
get. There are other things they 
want that are reasonable and they 
will get them.” 

In 2017, the University and GEO 
reached a contract agreement 
addressing pay caps on mental 
health 
services, 
formation 
of 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Graduate 
Student 
Student 
Assistant positions and greater 
protections 
for 
international 
graduate students. This contract 
was the result of 27 bargaining 
sessions, 
multiple 
sit-ins 
and 
threats of a walk-out.
Gauld said the purpose of the 
grade-in was both a response to 
HR’s proposal rejections and its 
impact on the future of graduate 
student workers.
“We 
see 
it 
really 
as 
an 
opportunity to make the labor 
that graduate students do visible,” 
Gauld said. “We’ve been asked 
more than once at the table what 
does the University get in return 
for the asks that we’re making, 
which is a bit of a trick question 
because they’re already getting 
our labor. So we want to make sure 
that it’s clear what exactly that 
labor is, how much we put into this 
University, and that our asks do not 
outweigh the work that we do.”
Rackham 
student 
Sumeet 
Patwardhan, co-chair of the GEO 
Bargaining Committee, attended 
the grade-in and spoke to The 
Daily about how GEO’s purpose 
and values impacted him.
“When I first became a graduate 
student here, I didn’t even know 
what a union was, that’s where I 
was sort of coming from into this 
process,” Patwardhan said. “I just 
felt it was very empowering to 
know that I wouldn’t have to fight 
for my rights and protections as 
a graduate student worker all by 
myself but that there is this union 
that would be collectively fighting

“Due to this increase, 
fewer than 12 students from 
the waitlist (who have not 
studied 
ASL 
previously) 
are able to begin the ASL 
sequence each year with 
the first-semester language 
course.”
The ASL program was 
established 
in 
1999 
in 
response to a student-led 
initiative 
to 
bring 
ASL 
courses to the University. 
Though the program was 
originally housed in the 
Department of Linguistics, 
it moved to the Residential 
College with the reopening 
of East Quad Residence Hall 
in 2013. While the RC houses 
ASL, ASL is not part of the 
RC language program.
The fourth semester of 
RCASL satisfies the LSA 
language 
requirement, 
but not the RC language 
requirement. 
Still, 
RC 
Director Catherine Badgley 
said the RC is looking into 
updated plans for all of their 
courses, including ASL, to 
adjust resource allocation 
and waitlists. 
“The 
ASL 
Program 
became 
part 
of 
the 
Residential College in 2013, 

and enrollments in ASL 
courses have been robust 
since then,” Badgley said. 
“In the RC, we are in the 
process of reviewing long-
term plans for all of our 
academic programs in light 
of enrollment trends, faculty 
availability, and resources.” 
According to the Modern 
Language 
Association’s 
most recent report on United 
States 
higher 
education 
enrollments in languages 
other than English, ASL 
is the third most studied 
language following Spanish 
and French. Berwanger said 
the limited number of ASL 
professors is a nationwide 
issue 
and 
Shipley 
noted 
ASL differs from most other 
languages taught because of 
its high student demand and 
low supply of professors and 
courses. Even compared to 
other less frequently taken 
languages, 
Shipley 
said, 
ASL has a long waitlist. 
“There’s obviously some 
languages that most people 
take 
that 
have 
endless 
sections and that don’t have 
waitlists 
because 
there 
are endless sections and 
endless professors,” Shipley 
said. 
“Then 
there 
are 
other languages that have 
the same issue where the 
programs are really small, 
but ASL differs because of 

that waitlist. There’s just a 
higher demand for it.”
Badgley said the waitlist 
signifies growing interest 
from 
students 
in 
both 
ASL 
and 
supporting 
marginalized communities. 
She also praised the student-
led aspect of the petition. 
“We are aware of the 
strong 
interest 
from 
students in having more 
courses in ASL and applaud 
the activism behind this 
petition,” Badgley wrote. 
Dentistry 
student 
Joseph Samona wrote in 
an email to The Daily his 
experience as a deaf student 
at the University has been 
positive 
with 
regards 
to 
accommodation 
and 
interpreters. 
“My 
experience 
at 
U 
of 
M 
has 
been 
great,” 
Samona wrote. “I was born 
profoundly deaf and I grew 
up 
with 
American 
Sign 
Language. At U of M, I have 
been using ASL interpreters 
for 
my 
education 
and 
having 
these 
kinds 
of 
accommodations play a big 
role in my education.” 
While Samona has not 
taken ASL courses at the 
University, he said other 
students 
he 
knows 
who 
have taken it have enjoyed 
delving 
deeper 
into 
the 
language and culture. 

“I have not taken any 
courses but I know few 
students that did,” he wrote. 
“They love learning ASL 
because it is a unique and 
creative language. They also 
got a chance to be involved 
with the Deaf community 
where they can experience 
the Deaf culture.” 
Samona said he supports 
the petition and believes it 
will positively impact all 
students at the University. 
“I 
think 
the 
need 
to 
expand the ASL program is 
important for the University 
of 
Michigan,” 
Samona 
wrote. “There are many 
students that have shown 
strong interest in ASL and 
this will be a wonderful 
opportunity for them to 
learn ASL and the Deaf 
culture.”
LSA junior Zachary Layle 
is president of the ASL Club, 
an 
organization 
bringing 
together hearing, deaf and 
hard 
of 
hearing 
people 
from the University and 
the Ann Arbor community 
to learn and practice ASL. 
Layle agreed that RCASL 
100’s long waitlist, along 
with the course sequence 
having only one hearing 
professor, limits learning 
opportunities for interested 
students.
While 
he 
considered 

taking the University’s ASL 
courses, 
Layle 
ultimately 
decided to learn through 
the club, which he said is a 
decision he is happy with. 
“I’ve learned an immense 
amount just from going to 
meetings and just practicing 
when I can,” he said. “I 
mean I’ll walk down the 
street and see a chair and 
I’ll fingerspell for ‘chair,’ so 
just little things like that. 
And I’ve grown immensely 
from where I started.” 
Layle is also supportive 
of the petition and has 
circulated it through the 
club in hopes of getting more 
professors and resources for 
ASL. 
“I think it’s awesome,” 
Layle said. “I’ve sent it out 
to any other groups I’m 
involved in and I said, ‘Hey, 
please just sign this. This 
is very important.’ Because 
it desperately needs to be 
expanded and even one more 
teacher would immensely 
improve the program at the 
University.” 
While 
Shipley’s 
main 
goal with the petition is to 
shorten RCASL 100’s long 
waitlist, she also wants the 
University to allocate more 
resources to the program. 
She hopes to eventually see 
a minor in ASL through the 
program. 

“The biggest concern is 
eliminating that waitlist,” 
Shipley said. “But with that 
comes a huge bottleneck 
effect, like if you get all 
these 
students 
off 
that 
Intro 100 or 101 waitlist, 
then what are you going to 
do when you get to 102? So 
ideally we’d like to add more 
sections of each course, 
really each level of ASL. The 
end goal would be an ASL 
minor, which doesn’t exist 
right now.” 
Layle 
believes 
the 
University can improve both 
the resources and attention 
it gives to ASL and the ASL 
program. Layle stressed the 
importance of treating ASL 
as its own language and 
allocating 
the 
necessary 
resources to it 
“I think a lot of hearing 
people see ASL and deaf 
culture 
as 
not 
its 
own 
language,” Layle said. “They 
don’t put it on the same 
level as they do say Spanish 
or Russian or French. It’s 
got its own culture, it has 
its own slang, it has its 
own grammar. It’s its own 
language and it deserves to 
be treated like every other 
language.”

“Annually, club sports 
administrators, so myself, 
our 
coordinator, 
my 
supervisor and our financial 
specialist 
look 
at 
our 
capacity to serve the clubs 
that we already have,” Hanna 
said. “And then if we have 
something that’s changed and 
maybe if we have the ability 
to add more organizations, 
which happened last year, 
then we open the application 
process.”
According 
to 
the 
Club 
Sports Handbook, available 
by request at the Recreational 
Sports 
Office, 
there 
are 
multiple requirements that 
teams must meet to apply for 
club status. These include 
being recognized as a student 
organization 
for 
at 
least 
two 
years, 
demonstrating 
fiscal responsibility during 
this time, having at least 
ten 
competitive 
members 
and showing evidence of 
a 
leadership 
transition 
beyond its original founders. 
Potential club sports teams 
must 
also 
have 
a 
non-
student coach and a national 
governing 
body 
for 
their 
sport, which allows them 
to compete against other 
universities. 
The process of reviewing 
the application is then taken 
up by the executive board, 
which is a body of students 
who have been elected by 
the Club Sports Council. 
Hanna said applicants must 
meet with the e-board to 
answer 
questions 
about 
their interest in club status. 
The 
e-board 
then 
makes 

recommendations on if the 
applicant group should be 
granted club status.
“From 
those 
recommendations, 
the 
administrative staff reviews 
them,” Hanna said. “We look 
at our situation as far as what 
our capacity is and where 
our capacity is, whether it’s 
facility space or advising 
time or financial resources. 
Then we look at what the 
need is from the clubs that 
have applied.”
In 2019, the competitive 
weightlifting 
team 
successfully petitioned for 
club status. The team has won 
multiple titles in different 
weight classes at the regional 
and national levels. 
LSA senior Celia Gold, 
co-president of weightlifting 
club, 
said 
club 
status 
achievement was an intensive 
process from the student 
perspective.
“The process to become a 
club sport is very rigorous. 
It includes many components 
that 
must 
be 
signed 
off 
on 
by 
staff,” 
Gold 
said. 
“Additionally, the club must 
prove they will be successful 
and fund themselves in order 
to get off the ground.”
Gold explained how her 
experience 
as 
an 
athlete 
changed as a result of the 
team’s new status.
“Beyond 
being 
able 
to 
utilize the block ‘M’, we 
now have access to club 
sports resources and a whole 
network of teams who have 
succeeded before us,” Gold 
said.
According 
to 
the 
recreational 
sports 
handbook, one of the ways 
club sports provide an inter-

sport network is through 
representation in the Club 
Sports 
Council, 
a 
body 
of 
representatives 
from 
each of the 30 club sports 
at Michigan. The Council 
provides 
the 
opportunity 
for 
teams 
to 
collaborate 
and learn from each other, 
promoting 
camaraderie 
across the University sports 
community. 
The student swim team, 
Swimming 
Wolverines 
At 
Michigan , is an example 
of 
a 
student 
athletic 
organization on campus that 
has faced issues achieving 
club 
status. 
Engineering 
sophomore William Soobert, 
administrative 
chair 
of 
SWAM, explained why a club 
swim team is important to 
non-varsity 
swimmers 
on 
campus.
“A few years ago, Andrew 
Westfall (created) Michigan 
club swimming, SWAM, for 
people like us who want to 
continue to swim in college 
but aren’t necessarily able 
to swim on the DI team at 
Michigan,” said Soobert. “We 
have turned it into more than 
just a swim team. We have 
turned it into a community, 
a family, we have all sorts of 
social events and all sorts of 
meets throughout the year.”
Soobert said the team, 
despite not being officially 
affiliated 
with 
the 
University, has competitively 
represented the University 
successfully this past year.
“We compete on a national 
level every year. Last year 
we placed top 30 out of 
over 
a 
hundred 
teams,” 
Soobert said. “We are pretty 
competitive even though we 
have only been around for 

five years.”
Engineering 
junior 
Robbie Amori, co-president 
of SWAM, explained why 
SWAM 
is 
pursuing 
club 
status so persistently.
“We want to be able to 

represent the University to 
our fullest potential,” Amori 
said. 
“We 
are 
currently 
representing them at the 
national level. We would 
like to do it in a more official 
capacity by wearing the block 
‘M’. It would also be great to 
have other side-benefits, like 
using the natatorium and to 
host meets for club funds.” 
Amori said SWAM has 
been told they are unable to 
achieve club status due to 
their lack of resources.
“I think one of the things 
that they say is that they 
can only support so many 
programs at a time,” Amori 
said. “Which is one reason 
why they won’t let us become 
sports 
status 
because 
they 
don’t 
have 
enough 
‘resources,’ is the word they 
say.” 
Hanna 
explained 
why 
some organizations are not 
offered club status by the 
Club Sports Program.
“Typically 
the 
reason 
that clubs are not offered 
sponsorships when they have 
applied is because there are 
(other) clubs that have a need 
that best matches what we 
have available at that time,” 
Hanna said. “So it’s not that 
they’re being denied, it’s that 
they are not being offered.”

Schlissel addressed the actions 
the 
University 
had 
previously 
taken in response to allegations of 
sexual misconduct against the late 
Robert Anderson, former director 
of University Health Services and 
an athletics team physician. In 
2003, Anderson retired from the 
University.
“The 
patient-physician 
relationship involves a solemn 
commitment and trust,” Schlissel 
said. “The allegations are highly 
disturbing. 
On 
behalf 
of 
the 
University, I apologize to anyone 
who was harmed by Dr. Anderson 
… To those who reported Dr. 
Anderson and to anyone who has 
reported sexual misconduct in any 
case, I express my sincere gratitude 
for your courage.”
Schlissel also commented on the 
recent investigation into Martin A. 
Philbert, the University’s provost 
and executive vice president for 
academic affairs, who was accused 
of multiple allegations of sexual 
misconduct. Schlissel said the 
University has hired an outside 
independent law firm to investigate 
the situation and therefore, he will 

not publicize the specifics of the 
case.
“Because this investigation is so 
critical and because we must ensure 
that the outside independent firm is 
able to conduct their investigation 
in a thorough, reliable and fair way, 
I will not be able to share any details 
while the investigation is underway, 
even though I know that there’s 
wide interest in the case,” Schlissel 
said.
Public Policy junior Ben Gerstein, 
Central 
Student 
Government 
president, 
also 
spoke 
at 
the 
meeting. His address began with a 
statement reaffirming his apology 
for comments he made in 2017 on 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. 
Multicultural 
organizations 
on 
campus called for public apologies 
from Gerstein and CSG Tuesday 
night, as well as anti-Islamophobia 
and anti-bias training for CSG 
members. 
“I want to reaffirm that apology 
and just reference my commitment 
and CSG’s collective commitment 
towards ensuring this campus is 
inclusive for our Palestinian, Arab 
and Muslim students,” Gerstein 
said. “We look forward to getting 
to work in the last four weeks of my 
administration to take action and 
show solidarity with students who 

felt impacted by my past words.” 
Gerstein continued by addressing 
a survey CSG released to the 
campus community at the end of 
December about mental health and 
well-being on campus. According to 
Gerstein, of the 2166 respondents, 55 
percent noted that Counseling and 
Psychological Services appointment 
wait times were a significant barrier 
toward seeking treatment. He also 
described the issue of a lack of well-
being resources for students on 
North Campus.
“I think it’s important that we 
recognize the incredibly difficult 
work of being a CAPS counselor, so 
I want to thank them for the work 
that they do when our students 
are able to see them,” Gerstein 
said. “But because of the extreme 
costs of off campus care, CAPS 
exists as really the only option for 
many students on campus who are 
seeking counseling, and so I think 
it’s important that we reaffirm our 
commitment to those resources and 
ensure that students aren’t waiting 
to seek help.”
The Regents announced the 
creation of a new, permanent 
committee chaired by University 
Regent Michael Behm (D) called 
The University of Michigan-Flint 
and the University of Michigan-

Dearborn 
Committee. 
The 
committee will receive reports and 
data on the finances, enrollment, 
student success, diversity and other 
factors regarding the Flint and 
Dearborn campuses. It will also 
report regularly to the board and 
meet with both campus chancellors.
“After 
holding 
town 
halls 
and each of us (The Regents) 
having meetings with different 
stakeholders of the two campuses, 
we feel it’s important to establish 
this standing committee,” Behm 
said. 
The board approved several 
construction projects to update 
facilities and infrastructure on 
campus. One approved resolution 
is a $145 million addition to the 
Bob and Betty Beyster Building to 
expand facilities for the computer 
science program and provide a 
new location for the School of 
Information. 
Other 
approved 
resolutions include a $4.8-million 
renovation 
of 
Hutchins’ 
Hall 
Auditorium 100, and a $39-million 
design for the proposed Dean 
Road Transportation Facility to 
provide the infrastructure for bus 
transportation equipment.
Bernstein 
commented 
on 
the resolutions to expand the 
Bob and Betty Beyster Building 

and construct the Dean Road 
Transportation 
Facility, 
saying 
that future capital projects should 
line up with the University’s goal 
of achieving carbon neutrality by 
2030. 
“For every major capital project, 
I’d like to see U-M’s architecture, 
engineering and construction team 
… provide a total life cycle analysis 
for a net-zero building,” Bernstein 
said. “What it will demonstrate 
is while the cost of a net-neutral 
building is probably larger up front, 
the longer-term cost of that building 
… is competitive or very likely 
cheaper.”
In a statement released shortly 
after the meeting, the Climate 
Action Movement praised the 
decision to freeze future fossil fuel 
investments while reiterating their 
demand for full divestment from 
fossil fuel companies.
“While this is a major victory 
for the fossil fuel divestment 
movement, it is only the first step,” 
the statement reads. “It is not enough 
to refrain from making additional 
divestments—the University must 
commit to divest the $1 billion it 
currently has invested in the fossil 
fuel industry.” 
 At the conclusion of the Board 
of Regents meeting, 15 public 

commenters had the opportunity 
to directly address University of 
Michigan administrators. Eleven 
of the comments touched upon 
issues of University climate policy. 
The remainder spoke about a lack 
of affordable housing, support 
for international students and 
equity across all three U-M 
campuses. 
Rackham 
student 
Akash 
Shah, co-director of Climate 
Blue, read from the letter 
the organization sent to the 
board and Schlissel last week 
reflecting 
on 
experiences 
from the 25th United Nations’ 
meeting of the Conference of 
Parties 
and 
recommending 
carbon neutrality by 2030. 
Shah called for the University 
to recognize the global impact 
it has on climate change. 
“As a citizen of Kenya 
and India, I can personally 
attest to the disproportionate 
effect of climate change on 
the global south, and U-M 
needs to reiterate its global 
commitment 
through 
local 
action,” Shah said.

Shaping the power of cinema

T

he 
92nd 
Academy 
Awards mark another 
year of cinema in an 
ever-changing social climate, 
one that does not embrace the 
cinematic experience in the 
same way it used to. For this 
reason, two of the Best Picture 
nominees provide particular 
interest in this day and age. 
Both Martin Scorsese’s “The 
Irishman” and Quentin Tar-
antino’s “Once Upon a Time 
in Hollywood” are films that 
attempt to restore themes 
of old cinema. For Scorsese, 
“The Irishman” represents a 
final collaboration between 
the classical acting legends 
Robert De Niro, Al Pacino 
and Joe Pesci. “Once Upon a 
Time in Hollywood” attempts 
to recreate the old Hollywood 
style of film and demonstrate 
its impact in the culture of 
the film’s period. Today, with 
the rise of short-form enter-
tainment and the increased 
“Netflix culture” of college 
students, can cinema truly 
impact our lives like it used 
to, and moreover, should it?
Over Winter break, while 
bickering over which movie 
to watch together one night, 
my family, mainly under the 
jurisdiction 
of 
my 
parents, 
chose “The Irishman.” I spent 
the first twenty minutes on my 
phone, having made up my mind 
that a three and a half hour 
movie starring actors all over 
70 could only be a snoozefest. 
Throughout 
the 
course 
of 
the film, however, I became 
fascinated with the plot and 
particularly the mood. Having 
never 
watched 
“Goodfellas,” 
“The 
Godfather” 
or 
any 
other prominent mob movie, 
I was enthralled by the loud 
personalities of the characters 
shown and the stark contrast 
in theirs to any sort of life I had 
lived or witnessed before. 
Films like “The Irishman” 
make 
one 
question 
the 
values that are drilled into 

us early in our lives about 
the ramifications of morally 
unjust 
actions, 
what 
true 
loyalty means in friendships 
and how much we can judge 
others for living societally 
frowned upon lifestyles. Frank 
Sheeran, as portrayed in the 
movie, fits the description 
of 
someone 
engaging 
inpsychopathic behavior on 
the surface. He killed men 
for a living without thinking 
twice about some of their 
deaths. Yet De Niro is able 
to demonstrate an extreme 
rationality in the character 
in that his ultimate goal is to 
provide for his family and only 
kill when he has to, without 
celebrating 
the 
deaths 
of 
his victims. His decisions 
throughout the movie are to 
protect those he loves and they 
ultimately backfire toward the 
end of his life, when he ends 
up alone as a consequence of 
the violent actions of his past. 
He is forced to ask if it was all 
really worth it.
Too 
often 
we 
watch 
movies 
as 
an 
isolated 
experience, 
nothing 
more 
than an extended amusement 
park ride, meant for pure 
entertainment 
over 
the 
course 
of 
a 
few 
hours. 
However, 
movies 
often 
provide clues about society 
and the state of the culture 
at their time. The movies that 
are able to transcend time, 
however, 
have 
the 
ability 
to shape society and set its 
course for the future rather 
than reflect what society is. 
Cinema is also unique in that 
it can open up new lenses 
and perspectives on life in 
ways no other medium can. 
Nowhere else can you live 
through someone else like in 
the theater and understand 
their struggles, motivations 
and most of all emotions — 
without driving to the closest 
theater and buying a movie 
ticket, that is. Literature and 

physical artwork can paint 
a picture in a viewer’s head, 
but there is something to be 
said for the ability to see a 
thousand 
mixed 
emotions 
in a character’s expression 
and, in a literal sense, see 
the picture the creator of the 
work intended.
As the rising generation, 
our ability to propel the 
future depends on an ability 
to see the present clearly 
from 
different 
points 
of 
view. Cinema can provide 
the opportunity to do that, 
and actually do so in a way 
that 
captures 
attention 
and passion, if we have the 
patience to let it. By showing 
interest 
and 
appreciation 
for 
cinema 
that 
moves 
culture forward, artists with 
revolutionary ideas can be 
given a platform and continue 
to benefit the world around 
us. In the world of short-
form media — from news on 
Twitter to communication 
via Instagram memes — it is 
easy to get sucked into the 
short-term rush of instant 
entertainment. 
While 
this 
form of media consumption 
may have some effect on 
society, much of the time 
there is little thought given 
to what those effects may 
be. As a result such mediums 
do not drive us forward as a 
people. Netflix was the only 
company willing to fund “The 
Irishman,” 
an 
indication 
of the course that today’s 
audience is paving. So as I 
write this article from the 
sudden all-knowing position 
of a college student who has 
seen one Robert De Niro 
movie, I end with an equally 
pompous, 
but 
nonetheless 
true, reminder to my peers: 
Art can only continue to 
shape the world around us if 
we allow it to.

Resist disillusionment in the wake of the Iowa caucus
O

n Feb. 3, millions of Americans, including many in the University of Michigan 

community, tuned in to watch the first votes of the 2020 election cycle. The 

Iowa caucus was supposed to be a night that provided clarity in the crowded 

race for the Democratic nomination and demonstrated Democrats’ first step in their quest 

to win back the White House. Instead, Iowa provided more questions than answers as an 

under-tested app severely delayed the results of the caucuses and underscored concerns 

about Iowa’s spot as the nation’s first primary.

Results from the caucuses were 
delayed by almost 24 hours as a 
hastily built app, meant to expedite 
the tabulation process, made 
reporting more difficult. Iowa 
Democratic Party spokesperson 
Mandy McClure clarified that 
“the app did not go down,” but 
users at the precincts said they 
were unable to connect to the app’s 
central server, and phone lines 
were so busy that in some cases 
the workers were on hold for more 
than an hour.
Iowa is not the only state 
pushing to implement technology 
into the election cycle. West 
Virginia, 
Oregon, 
Colorado, 
California and Utah are all at 
different stages of testing new 
remote voting systems, despite 
strong warnings from leading 
cybersecurity experts. However, 
the decision to use an app in the 
Iowa caucus showed a significant 
failure in judgement. The app was 
the result of a $60,000 contract 
with a software company called 
Shadow Inc., and was put together 
in a matter of months. In such a 
critical and contested election year, 
it’s shocking the Iowa Democratic 
Party decided to implement an 
untested, vulnerable app that could 
have jeopardized the integrity of 
the election. 
The fiasco in Iowa has also 
reignited the debate over Iowa’s 
role as the first state to vote in 
the primaries and the caucus 
system in general. Since 1972, 
Iowa has been the first state to 
vote for both the Democratic and 
Republican nominees. Being first 
gives Iowa outsized influence in 
the nomination process, as well as 
a massive financial windfall, with 
campaigns spending on everything 
from TV ads to hotel rooms.
Additionally, there are some 
valid concerns about the fairness 
and accessibility of the caucuses. 
Just as the outdated nature of the 
caucus system has been mentioned 
across the country, many voters 
have voiced their desire for a more 
representative state to begin the 
primary process as the Democratic 
Party stands to represent a wide 
swath of minority groups. 90 
percent of Iowans are white, much 
higher than the national average 
of 60 percent. The Iowa caucus 
is also held on a specific night at a 
specific time with no exceptions. 
There are no early voting or 
absentee ballots for the caucus, and 
people are forced to spend hours 
participating in them. This can 

be difficult for parents, minimum 
wage workers, students and people 
with disabilities. This year the Iowa 
Democratic Party tried to address 
these problems by adding caucuses 
in places like nursing homes while 
implementing satellite caucuses 
— including one in Ann Arbor. 
However, questions still remain 
about whether the caucus system 
should continue, given that its 
structural inflexibility can be a 
barrier to many voters. States like 
Nevada, which also has a caucus, 
have taken even more proactive 
steps to address these problems by 
instituting early voting and putting 
caucus sites in casinos to give 
casino workers the chance to vote. 
It is changes like these that could 
help make nominating a candidate 
more fair and democratic.

With the Iowa caucus debacle 
remaining 
unresolved, 
the 
Democratic National Convention 
(DNC) head was forced to call for 
a recanvass, causing the race to 
remain in largely the same place 
as it was before voting began 
in 
the 
immediate 
aftermath. 
Despite the claims that Iowa is 
unrepresentative and that it only 
has 41 delegates up for grabs, its 
significance has persisted. Iowa 
has long been used to filter the 
field and narrow the choices for 
the following primary states, and 
for Iowa to signal to the rest of the 
country which candidates have 
support and momentum that can 
be used in the general election. 
The quintessential Iowa success 
story comes from 2008, when then-
Senator Barack Obama increased 
his profile by winning 37.6 percent 
of the vote in Iowa, a result 
which propelled him through 
the primaries and into the White 
House. 
While 
candidate 
Pete 
Buttigieg, Mayor of South Bend, 
Ind., ultimately boosted his profile 
by winning one more delegate than 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the 
results and delegate allocation 
shifted multiple times in the days 

following the caucuses and both 
Buttigieg and Sanders have since 
asked for a recount of select caucus 
sites. Buttigieg and Sanders each 
declaring victory eliminated the 
opportunity for a clear frontrunner 
to take hold before the race moved 
on to the New Hampshire primary 
on Feb. 11.
While New Hampshire only 
has 24 delegates in contention, its 
results stood in as the Iowa of the 
2020 election, helping determine 
which candidates have support as 
the primary schedule heats up — 
again, Buttigieg and Sanders. The 
failure of the Iowa caucus leaves 
the race crowded for voters making 
decisions in early voting states, 
such as California, where 15 million 
ballots were sent by mail the same 
day Iowa voting commenced.
The results of the primaries 
moving 
forward 
will 
be 
increasingly called into question 
and dragged out due to the 
failure of Iowa out of the gate. 
The Democrats cannot afford 
any more mistakes in the coming 
primaries and caucuses. On Super 
Tuesday, one-third of the total 
delegates are available, as 16 states 
and territories will take to the 
ballot booths. A crowded field of 
candidates into New Hampshire 
and a close race into Super 
Tuesday hinders the decisiveness 
that the primaries are meant 
to show to voters moving into a 
pivotal year for the Democrats.
The DNC’s failure in the Iowa 
caucus reflects the need for 
precision and care moving forward. 
The purpose of early primaries 
and caucuses is to signal 
to the coming states which 
candidates have widespread 
support. We, as The Michigan 
Daily Editorial Board, call for 
greater 
transparency 
from 
the DNC and more careful 
consideration 
of 
how 
the 
primaries are to be carried 
out. Through this, we can 
ensure the voices of the nation 
are heard and represented 
equally. Despite the setback in 
the Iowa caucus, we encourage 
our 
readers 
to 
remain 
politically informed and not to 
let this disappointment deter 
them from exercising their 
political vote. Further, we also 
urge voters to resist becoming 
disillusioned with the electoral 
system and to continue to stay 
engaged and up to date ahead 
of the Michigan primary on 
March 10.

A

s a self-proclaimed cof-
fee 
enthusiast, 
I’ve 
always had an inces-
sant curiosity for coffee shops 
— the people, the atmosphere 
and of course, the coffee. The 
process of examining the menu 
of roasts, consulting a barista to 
validate my decision and sipping 
my selection over good conver-
sation is my definition of heav-
en. Unfortunately, as school gets 
busier, heaven becomes a little 
harder to recreate, and good 
conversation is replaced by a 
hurried “please,” “thank you” 
and “have a good one.” Coffee 
culture as a whole has taken on 
a new meaning where the only 
connection we’re seeking is the 
WiFi. 
College has taken my caffeine 
intake to new heights, and I’ve 
learned to embrace my routine, 
from the cup that starts my 
day off to the unapologetic 
second and third coffee runs at 
the UMMA Cafe or Espresso 
Royale. I’m hardly alone in my 
tendencies: Nearly 22 percent 
of all college student beverage 
consumption is coffee, and of 
students who drink “pick-me-
up” beverages, 52.4 percent 
prefer 
coffee. 
Whether 
it’s 
staying holed up at a corner 
table 
of 
the 
ever-crowded 
Starbucks on State Street for 
hours on end or running in and 
out of the store gulping down a 
Venti-sized drink, trips to the 
coffee shop have simply become 
an intermediate between the 
person and their beverage of 
choice. Even the role of baristas 
has been diminished to acting as 
a middleman. As if headphones 
and hectic schedules weren’t 
enough to distract customers 
from 
engaging 
with 
their 
surroundings, 
mobile 
orders 
have granted us a far more 
convenient way to minimize 
any face to face interactions. 
With the introduction of mobile 
orders now making up about 
30 percent of all Starbucks 
transaction 
payments, 
any 
potential 
barista-customer 
conversation has come to a 
screeching halt. I too, the coffee 
aficionado myself, am guilty 
of giving in to the quick swipe 
on my phone, too preoccupied 
with chemistry homework to 
be bothered to walk the five 

steps toward the register. It 
took me several occurrences of 
picking up the wrong drink and 
being envious of the occasional 
customer who was on a first-
name basis with their favorite 
barista to realize that I have a 
problem — never with my intake 
of course, but with my method.
In all the madness that is 
college, I realized I’ve been 
cheating myself out of the coffee 
culture I was once so excited 
about 
experiencing 
here 
in 
Ann Arbor. I’m surrounded by 
coffee joints at every corner, 
but there’s something missing: 
I’m in the coffee shop, but 
I’m not all there. None of us 
are. We’re too engrossed in 
textbooks to notice the barista 
calling our order. We’re too 
consumed by deadlines to hear 
the girl standing in front of us 
ask, “Is anyone sitting there?” 
The campus coffee shops have 
become a place where heads are 
down, and people are not really 
people. 
But this is not how coffee 
shops are meant to function. 
Coffee shops are an example 
of what urban sociologist Ray 
Oldenburg considers a third 
place. Third places, like bars, 
bookstores and cafes, are meant 
to be an escape from work and 
home life. They foster a sense 
of 
community, 
spark 
lively 
conversation 
and 
encourage 
creative interaction between 
the people inhabiting the space. 
Per this theory analyzed in 
Oldenburg’s book, “The Great 
Good Place,” people must find 
their balance between their 
domestic place, their productive 
place and their socially inclusive 
place. 
Leading 
a 
healthy 
lifestyle suggests harmonizing 
these 
“three 
realms 
of 
experience.” For me, that means 
Mary Markley Residence Hall, 
the Chemistry Building and 
Espresso 
Royale. 
Oldenburg 
emphasizes the importance of 
differentiation between these 
three spaces, and therein lies the 
problem. Markley Hall becomes 
so socially inclusive it seems 
to expel a need for the third 
place. The long hours of back-
to-back lab, lecture and study 
group 
make 
the 
Chemistry 
Building seem too much like 
home. And the coffee shop run 

ends up becoming a quick fuel 
recharge of the exhausting two-
model system Oldenburg warns 
against. 
College 
students 
have 
become so reliant on coffee as 
a source of caffeine that we 
lose sight of the rich culture 
coffee shops provide us with. 
We forget that it can serve as a 
third place, as it does in so many 
countries. A coffee shop in the 
Netherlands would mock the 
“to-go” order endlessly. There, 
caffeination occurs gradually, 
in 
small 
sips, 
surrounded 
by good company — which 
sounds much more relaxing 
than downing a triple shot in 
the Hatcher Library reference 
room staring at an outline for 
a nine-page philosophy paper. 
Third places are meant to serve 
as a leveler where inclusivity 
thrives, where workers and 
non-working individuals tread 
the same ground and where the 
purpose of gathering is “pure 
sociability.” The characteristics 
of third places are so vividly 
present in coffee shops, if only 
we had the time to notice them 
and engage in them.
Of course, I understand that 
as college students, we don’t 
have the luxury of being able 
to spend two hours over a dark 
roast pour-over, reminiscing 
about life. We’re busy, and for 
us, coffee is just a means. The 
constant need for a pick-me-up 
is ingrained as part of the college 
student experience, but it’s time 
we reclaim our favorite coffee 
shops on campus. It’s time we 
reinstate coffee culture as a sit-
down experience. We need that 
third place to unwind from our 
busy lives, so why not seek out 
that relief in something that is 
already so heavily incorporated 
into daily routine? Next time 
you’re having an “I need coffee 
in an IV moment,” take a second 
to engage in that superfluous 
conversation with the barista. 
Glance up from your textbooks 
once in a while and notice the 
regulars. Peel away from your 
laptop screen and admire your 
home away from home. For 
your own sake, stop and smell 
the coffee.

As enticing as a story about a manipulative 
mother who systematically poisons her daughter 
for years sounds, Stephanie Wrobel’s debut 
“Darling Rose Gold” manages to add an even 
more interesting wrinkle to this premise. It’s 
likely you’ve heard of Munchausen syndrome 
by proxy (MSBP): A child’s caretaker fabricates 
illnesses to make the child seem sick. This form 
of child abuse is a focal point of depictions 
such as HBO’s documentary “Mommy Dead 
and Dearest” and Hulu’s “The Act.” For the 
most part, such narratives culminate with the 
revelation that leads to the caretaker’s arrest, 
but Wrobel states that her novel “begins where 
most novels … end — with the reveal upfront.” 
Patty Watts has been in prison for five years, 
and the novel begins with the day of her release, 
when her daughter, Rose Gold Watts, takes her 
in, seemingly forgiving her for poisoning her for 
eighteen years of her life. The reader experiences 
the present through Patty’s eyes, and the five 
years during which she’s imprisoned through 
Rose Gold’s eyes, and as these two narratives 
come closer to intertwining, the question 
remains: Why would Rose Gold give her mother 
shelter? Wrobel draws out the suspense of this 
question well, and the uncertainty of the answer 
carries much of the novel’s momentum. But not 
effectively enough. 
I was struck by how poor the novel’s attempt 

was at creating a compelling and realistic 
abusive mother, and when half the novel 
devolves into disengaging and inauthentic first-
person narration, it’s difficult to take the story 
seriously. The concept of “show don’t tell” is 
nonexistent here. Patty is reduced to a hand-
wringing caricature, comically thinking to 
herself about how she can 
manipulate 
her 
daughter 
again, “She’s not the only 
Watts capable of forming a 
plan … Now I know her weak 
spot: Adam,” (Rose Gold’s 
infant son). Patty’s character 
lacks nuance, her reasoning 
is simplistic. While MSBP 
is a real phenomenon, and 
there have certainly been 
individuals similar to Patty 
Watts, Wrobel’s novel lacks 
an 
awareness 
that 
such 
individuals are still human, 
and should still be portrayed 
as such. 
Regardless of the morality of a character’s 
actions, they should still be sincere. Patty 
is jarring, not because of the audacity of 
her actions, but because of the lack of depth 
underlying them. Few people explicitly declare 
and acknowledge the intentions, biases and 
motivations behind their every thought. Wrobel 
hamfistedly pushes the narrative that Patty 
Watts is one-dimensionally bitter, vengeful and 
hateful. Every other page, Patty pats herself 

on the back for pissing off the reader with her 
willful obstinance. All this being said, I had no 
problem with Patty’s actions themselves. Her 
character would have been better served by 
subtlety and humanity. She should have been 
a character who the reader wants to hate, but 
can’t quite hate because the reader understands 
her on some level.
In contrast to this, the 
eponymous character, Rose 
Gold, does add an intriguing 
level of depth to Wrobel’s 
debut. 
Ironically, 
Wrobel 
stated 
that 
her 
biggest 
difficulty in writing the 
novel was “getting Rose 
Gold’s voice right.” While 
Rose 
Gold 
suffers 
from 
some of the artless one-
dimensionality Patty does, 
her character arc throughout 
the novel is both engaging 
and realistic. For the most 
part, satisfactory character 
development is hindered by the time spent on 
her mother’s character, and if more time were 
to be invested in her character (and less in her 
mother’s), the novel would be considerably 
better. Regardless of these caveats, Rose Gold 
effectively inspires pity and dread as the reader 
witnesses her embark on an increasingly toxic 
trajectory. Her struggle to break free from 
Patty’s legacy, even as Rose Gold is haunted by 
similarities she shares with her mother, is tragic 

and sobering. Though a few of the similarities 
Rose Gold begins to show are somewhat 
incongruent with the rest of her established 
character, she remains a grim reminder of how 
children of abuse struggle to break free long 
after they escape the abuser. Thus, much of the 
suspense is built upon whether or not Rose Gold 
is able to mature before her path is cemented.
One of “Darling Rose Gold’s” biggest strengths 
is the novelty of the premise. Though MSBP is 
commonly depicted in media, Wrobel portrays a 
stage of headline-making criminal cases that is 
often ignored: the aftermath. Her novel shows 
the unpleasant reality that, often, after justice 
is served, a happy ending isn’t a certainty, and 
recovery isn’t easy. The novel illustrates one of 
the many shortcomings of the punitive American 
criminal justice system, which often accounts 
for neither the victim’s nor the perpetrator’s 
welfare following the verdict. It’s a relevant 
issue to consider, and the intrigue of Rose Gold’s 
emotional transformation throughout the novel 
demonstrates the potential for such narratives. 
Though the novel’s third act was by far the 
strongest, with a page-turning climax and an 
unexpectedly somber ending, the same could 
have been accomplished if the novel had focused 
solely on Rose Gold’s recovery and struggles.
It’s unfortunate that so much of “Darling 
Rose Gold” was defined by what could have 
been, but the novel struggled to fully develop 
fruitful emotional connections with the reader, 
and what resulted was a so-so character study of 
a warring mother and daughter.

Coming out of the theatre after “Portrait of 
a Lady on Fire,” I felt a little disappointed. The 
plot had seemed right up my alley: in the late 
1700s, a painter (Noémie Merlant, “Heaven 
Will Wait”) and her subject (Adèle Haenel, 
“Suzanne”), an aristocratic woman about 
to be married to a stranger, fall in love. The 
performances were great from the start, which 
was a good sign. Both 
Marianne, the artist, and 
Héloïse, the aristocrat, 
are played wonderfully 
by Merland and Haenel. 
The 
cinematography 
is 
immaculate 
too, 
perfectly 
capturing 
a 
rustic French villa that 
lies next to a sparkling 
sea. Still, for most of the 
movie, I was bored out 
of my skull. 
We 
never 
learn 
much about the two 
characters, except that one is a painter and 
the other is an aristocrat who doesn’t want 
to get married. Certain questions that more 
conventional movies would address, such as 
what it’s like growing up LGBTQ+ in a hostile 
time, are thrown to the wayside for understated 
scenes where little is said. Mostly, characters 
spend time walking on the beach, painting, 
looking at paintings, and making out. I wasn’t 
sure what these women saw in one another, or 
what they got out of their relationship. It’s hard 
to care about them without knowing what’s at 
stake. 
The movie plays out like a long, hazy daydream 
about two 1700s-era women I knew little about. 

There are moments that blow past this subdued 
temporal distance, especially the titular scene: 
a black dress burns while the woman wearing 
it stares intently into the camera. In another, 
a maid discovers she is pregnant and frankly 
admits she wants an abortion, blowing through 
usual “period piece” stereotypes. These piercing 
scenes were few and far between, though, and 
mostly I was underwhelmed. This is a shame, 
because one of my favorite genres is LGBTQ+ 
cinema. 
Why 
didn’t 
“Portrait” 
affect 
me 
like 
“Moonlight,” “Call Me by 
Your Name” and “Love 
Simon” did? On my way 
home from the movie, 
I 
realized 
what 
was 
lacking: joy.
In “Moonlight,” Chiron 
discovers his sexuality 
through a moonlit kiss 
on a Californian beach. 
In “Call Me By Your 
Name,” Elio and Oliver 
first kiss in a whispering 
grass field under a shady 
tree. The kiss in “Love 
Simon” is atop a ferris wheel during a fireworks 
show, while an entire high school cheers the 
couple on. Even “The Favourite” had joyous 
(albeit deranged) love between Queen Anne and 
her female suitors.
The ending of “Portrait” has no crazy leap of 
faith, no unexpected, perfect lovers’ reunion 
and there’s no ferris wheel to be found. It ends 
sadly, and I wonder why these two women 
let things end without putting up any kind of 
fight. Yet is it realistic of me to ask for a happy 
ending for characters who lived in a time when 
LGBTQ+ identities were ignored, marginalized 
and directly attacked?
Perhaps I’ve been a tad spoiled by the 

recent flourishing of queer cinema. While 
essential, and utterly triumphant, the cinematic 
mainstream’s embrace of LGBTQ+ characters 
has been a tad one-dimensional. 
Take two recent examples from this past 
summer. In “Rocketman,” Elton John goes 
through a tumultuous journey of fame and self 

discovery that culminates with the perfect 
American husband and kids. In “Booksmart,” 

Amy’s first time ends with her puking on the 
girl, but she still somehow gets her phone 
number by the movie’s end. 
Love is a spectrum, and queer cinema should 
reflect that. It can be sublime, but more often 
than not it has shades of frustration, confusion 
and, yes, boredom. Endings aren’t always happy, 
and beginnings aren’t either. Would it really be 
realistic for a film set in the 1700s to have two 
women find perfect, unrestrained happiness 
in a relationship deemed a mortal sin by their 
society? In that situation, I’d be hesitant too. 
While it’s been great to revel in the colorful, 
excited sense of romance in recent LGBTQ+ 
movies, more complex fare must be encouraged 
too. 
Other 
countries, 
time 
periods 
and 
experiences should be brought to the table, and 
every queer film is valid no matter the amount 
of fireworks.
In retrospect, I’m glad “Portrait of a Lady on 
Fire” took such a realistic approach, and look 
forward to seeing it again.

Making DIY music work in Southeastern Michigan

DIY can be difficult. Finding venues for your 
band to play can be a nearly impossible task, 
especially when you’re trying to perform outside 
of your hometown. Frantically reaching out 
to strangers or friends that might be loosely 
connected to a scene can be very hit-or-miss, and 
pay-to-play venues rarely work out in your favor. 
However, for bands looking to play Southeastern 
Michigan, it might be easier than you think.
Outta This World Booking is a group that aims 
to help smaller, self-run bands find shows around 
Michigan. 
“I’ve been playing shows since the end of high 
school, and I grew up going to shows,” Pat Ray, 
the founder of the booking group, said in a phone 
interview with The Daily. “I was booking shows 
regularly for a couple years, sort of as a one-off 
thing where I would help out a friend or someone 
would message me and say that they could return 
the favor of booking my band.”
“But since graduating college, and working and 
being more quote unquote adult, I felt like I could 
make this all a bit more organized than the way I 
was doing it. And then, about a year ago, in the spur 
of the moment, I just decided to make a Facebook 
page and come up with a name that I can use as a 
banner to promote shows.” 
From there, Ray recruited some friends and 
started Outta This World Booking, with the 
mission of helping out the local music community.
For many groups without a manager or a record 

label, touring can be a daunting task. 
He added,“It’s hard to be like, ‘I just started this 
band. I want to play a show in New York. I don’t 
know anyone in New York … how the hell do I do 
that?’ And most of the time, you just have to take a 
couple shots in the dark.” 
But Ray hopes to make this process easier for 
bands traveling through Southeastern Michigan. 
“Touring is always hit or miss — sometimes it’s 

a Tuesday night and there’s like, ten people there,” 
Ray said. “The difference I try to make is that 
when these bands come through, I want to make 
sure they feel welcome, and that they’re getting a 
worthwhile experience.”
Since its founding, Outta This World has 
expanded into a team of eight or nine individuals, 
taking more of a do-it-together approach. 
“I don’t really think of it as mine anymore,” Ray 
said. “I have a team of wonderful people that … 

more than pull their weight.” 
Ray said that in the future, they’re hoping to 
expand their base with more like-minded and 
passionate people, and bring more consistency to 
their shows. 
The group is also trying to branch out with new 
events and festivals. 
“We’re also trying to do some more cool 
projects,” Ray told me. “We recently did a new 
event called New Year, New Music, where we had 
a bunch of artists submit demos to us, and then 
we picked the top ten of these artists to perform 
at the Loving Touch. We recorded all of these 
performances, and will be releasing them later on 
this year.” 
Setting up a show can be pretty chaotic. The 
process consists of “a lot of frantic messaging,” 
according to Ray. Bands constantly reach out to 
the group in an effort to find a show in the area. 
After checking out their music, Ray said the group 
will also make sure that the band doesn’t have any 
history of unfriendly behavior. 
“A big part of DIY is the ethical and moral 
beliefs that are inherent to this community,” Ray 
said. “We don’t really think that bands with drastic 
differences in those areas would fit very well in our 
community.” 
Once the booking group has a band they’re 
excited about, they need to find a venue and local 
support for the band. Since a good chunk of the 
members on the team have played frequently at 
venues in the area, the group is at the point now 
where they can find a venue or house show contact 
point quickly in order to get the show set up. The 
next step is reaching out to artists to play along 

with the touring band. 
“Something that I, and I think every booker 
could be better at is … when you’re setting up a bill, 
making sure that it’s not just an all-white-dude 
show, you know?” Ray said. “We want to make 
sure we’re giving a voice to the more marginalized 
communities.”
From there, the group is responsible for 
promoting the show with fliers and Facebook 
events and making sure the show runs smoothly 
the day of. 
Since being exposed to DIY in southeastern 
Michigan almost four years ago (at a show Ray was 
playing, no less), I’ve really been fortunate enough 
to see it grow as much as it has because of people 
that care as much as Ray does. 
“It’s really just a very inspiring community,” 
Ray told me. “I’ve become friends with people all 
throughout the country because of this community. 
And it’s awesome.”

I wasn’t sure what these

Love is a spectrum, and

MUSIC REVIEW
DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

‘And It’s Still Alright’ is 
stripped-back and cliche
Looking back at the brutal 
ending to ‘Animorphs’

The struggle between producing content that 
music consumers want to hear and staying true to 
the artist’s heart is, and has been, the plight of the 
singer/songwriter since the genre gained traction. 
It’s the fine balance every artist struggles with until 
they finally decide to do what every artist before 
them has done — release an album that strays far 
from their traditional sound in an attempt to reach 
new and profound conclusions. Nathaniel Ratecliff 
embraces this cliche on And It’s Still Alright, his third 
solo album. He grapples with his recent divorce and 
the death of a close friend, dedicating the album to 
processing the loneliness and sorrow of loss. After 
breaking into the music scene by belting burly soul 
music with the Night Sweats, Rateliff has swung 
to the other extreme of Americana, designing this 
album to be intimate, confessional and cathartic — 
everything a Night Sweats album is not. 
Taking a more stripped back approach, the album 
focuses on Rateliff’s vocals and acoustic guitar 
while all other elements (soft strings, muted finger 
snaps and quiet percussion) seem to fall around the 
centerpiece. “Time Stands” is a collage of ideas — 
waiting for true love, mourning a failed relationship 
and the harshness of passing time — which ultimately 
creates a meaningless yet profound account of losing 
the one you love. “Time stands in a duel and I stand 
for you,” Rateliff bellows over an acoustic guitar 
backed by a high-pitched organ, as if to create a 

glimmer of light shining through darkness.
The album’s raw aesthetic oddly clashes with its 
intentions for a close listen. Rateliff mumbles over 
twangy guitar riffs, producing a vocal performance 
that lacks any shape or mood. He writes to burrow 
inward, inviting listeners into that part of himself, 
but his slurred phrasing and lazy diction contradicts 
this invitation. The album’s final track, “Rush On,” 
is one of the more somber tracks on the album, 
featuring low guitars, a heavy bass drum and 
Rateliff lethargically stringing together lyrics 
whose meanings get lost in his long, drawn out 
mumbling. 
But Rateliff doesn’t leave the album too somber. 
The album’s first track, “What A Drag,” is a bluesy, 
playful tune that contrasts its rather melancholy 
lyrics. “I left, I left feeling alone / But you can undo 
it, man,” Rateliff sings with twangy optimism. The 
album’s title track is also more optimistic in nature 
with its graceful front porch strides and light, 
upbeat guitar riffs. 
While the album is beautiful in its raw, authentic 
approach to music and the human experience, 
Rateliff has clearly fallen into the cliche singer-
songwriter trap. He uses this album to dig deep 
into his “real emotions,” but takes an exaggerated 
step away from his retro, soulful sound with the 
Night Sweats, overemphasizing how this album 
is supposed to deliver something different than 
anything he’s ever written before. Despite this 
misstep, And It’s Still Alright delivers some heavy 
emotions with grace, and like much of the folk 
music we hear today, reminds us of how music can 
pull us out of our pain and suffering.

To an elementary school kid with an insatiable thirst 
for reading, there was no greater joy than going to 
the school library. In a way, besides the books in your 
own home or the books you might occasionally buy 
from a store, the books contained in a library were all 
that there was. All the books contained in that school 
library were books you could find easily, checkout and 
read. Everything beyond those walls was an enigma, 
out of reach and out of sight. Libraries, by their very 
nature, exist a few years behind in terms of their book 
availability. School libraries even more so. Because of 
this, in the early 2000s when I was growing up, the 
library at Wines Elementary School still contained 
many books from the late 90’s. There were dozens 
upon dozens of “Boxcar Children,” “Goosebumps,” and 
“Babysitters Club,” but by far the coolest looking books 
on the shelf were “Animorphs.”
With each cover showing a kid turning into an 
animal and the scary blurbs on the back warning of an 
impending alien invasion, those books were basically 
crying out to be read by sci-fi-minded children. Our 
library had almost every one of them, books 1-53 and 
a plethora of spinoffs. All except one. The final book in 
the series, number 54 “The Beginning,” was nowhere to 
be found. While kids are certainly curious individuals, 
they don’t quite have the attention span of adults. And 
while I certainly wondered how the whole thing was 
supposed to end, this small mystery, along with most of 
my memories and feelings about Animorphs in general, 
faded into the dark recesses of my mind, packaged away 
with memories of the playground and kindergarten. 
This past summer I while I was interning in LA, I 
took a weekend trip to Portland, Oregon to visit some 
old camp friends I hadn’t seen in years. While there, 
we went to a used bookstore in the city. Lo and behold, 
while casually looking through the shelves, I stumbled 
across the entirety of the Animorphs series, including 
that elusive final chapter. Memories flooding back to 
me, I decided it was long overdue that I found out how 
the whole thing wrapped up. I bought the penultimate 
book as well so I could re-acquaint myself with the story 
and threw the two 100 pagers in my backpack for the 
flight home. How little did I know what was awaiting 
me… 
You see, it turns out there was a reason why 
my children’s library didn’t have the final book in 
this children’s series. While it could be a mighty 
coincidence, after reading the end I’m left to assume 
some adult somewhere decided this was too much for 
kids and removed it from the library. “Animorphs” was 
a kids series through and through for much of its run. 
In every book the heroic “Animorphs” (kids who could 

turn into animals) would acquire a new “morph” (or 
animal to turn into), allowing them to solve the problem 
of the day that usually involved the alien Yeerks who 
were trying to take over the planet. Nothing much 
really changed from book to book and the battle with 
the Yeerks more or less felt like a stalemate designed to 
last forever and make as much money for publishers as 
possible. Not so in the last act. In the penultimate novel, 
Jake, arguably the main character of the series, orders 
a ton of secondary animorphs to their deaths (all of the 
animorphs are children, by the way) and then commits 
an act of genocide by flushing millions of unarmed 
Yeerks into the cold vacumm of space. Book 53 ends 
on a cliffhanger, with the conclusion of the war still to 
come. In 120-page “The Beginning,” the war ends in 
the second chapter. The rest of the book is about the 
aftermath. And what a terribly depressing aftermath it 
is. 
As the final step in his master plan to defeat the 
Yeerks, Jake orders his cousin Rachel to her death. 
Tobias, Rachel’s lover, never forgives Jake and goes to 
live out the rest of his life in exile. Jake himself suffers 
from PTSD and is unable to live a normal life, grief-
stricken over the things he did in order to win the 
war. It’s a coda at the end of what had been a relatively 
breezy series about kids battling aliens that takes a 
sharp turn into major anti-war writing in the last two 
books. I got off the plane and felt cold and empty inside. 
In “Animorphs” there is no “Nineteen Years Later,” no 
“All was well,” no Ewok celebration or fireworks after 
the funeral of Tony Stark. There is only war and the pain 
it inflicts upon all those who take part in it, no matter 
the righteousness of the cause. These are heavy themes, 
certainly not ones that I would have understood at age 
9. But when I got off that plane my mind was totally 
blown. 
I wondered what I would have thought if I had read 
that book all those years ago. I read the penultimate 
book and never realized it was setting up Jake as a 
PTSD-stricken genocidal warmonger, so maybe the 
events of 54 would have gone over my head as well. Or 
maybe not. Maybe some other kid, years before me, 
read number 54 and burst into tears, inconsolable until 
an adult took the book from their hands, locked it in a 
dungeon, and made sure no Wines Elementary school 
student would ever read it again. Whatever the case, 
for a series that I read fifteen years ago to reach across 
time and move me today, I have no choice but to give my 
respects. Not everything needs a happy ending because 
not everything in life has a happy ending. I don’t know 
what I would’ve thought of this when I was nine, but as 
a 21 year old with an uncertain future, I tip my hat to 
K.A. Applegate, Scholastic Books and all the rest. These 
were books about kids turning into animals to fight slug 
aliens. There were trading cards and a crappy TV show 
on Nickelodeon. “The Beginning” had no right to be 
such a moving end.had no right to be such a moving end.

In 
the 
fourth 
inning 
of 
Sunday’s 
game 
against 
Louisville, 
Michigan 
had 
trimmed a two-run deficit to 
one and was threatening for 
more with the potential tying 
run standing at first. Senior 
infielder Madison Uden was 
next in line to prolong the 
rally. 
But instead of letting Uden 
bat, Carol Hutchins opted for 
a change. Michigan’s coach 
looked down her dugout and 
summoned 
junior 
infielder 
Taylor Bump to pinch hit. 
A year ago, the situation 
would 
have 
flustered 
an 
inexperienced 
Bump. 
On 
Sunday, 
it 
did 
anything 
but. She strode to the plate 
unfazed and confident, a sense 
of calmness drowning any 
would-be nerves. 
Moments earlier, Bump rode 
the bench. Suddenly, she was 
mid-home run trot around the 
bases, having reclaimed the 
Wolverines’ lead with a two-
run rocket to dead center field. 
And she had a new mentality 
to thank. 
Pinch hitting is, to any 
softball 
player’s 
admission, 
not easy. It’s a role defined 
by an element of waiting, of 
suspenseful uneasiness, that 
no player welcomes. Starters 
have the luxury of knowing 
when their spot in the batting 
order is up and can prepare 
accordingly. 
Bench 
players, 
meanwhile, can be thrust into 
the fire any second. There’s a 
steep learning curve to such a 
stark role difference. 
Bump — now 2-for-2 in 
pinch-hitting 
opportunities 
this season — seems to have 
found comfort in her role. 
“The reason 
they want you 
to 
pinch 
hit 
in 
the 
game 
is 
because 
they 
actually 
believe you can 
get it done in 
the 
moment,” 
Bump 
said. 
“That’s 
something 
I 
struggled with 
last year. When 
I went in to pinch hit, I was 
putting too much pressure on 
myself in the moment. This 
season, I’m just able to focus 
on the one pitch and not, 
‘What happens if I don’t get 
a hit on this at-bat, are my 
opportunities over?’
“Just 
having 
confidence 
no matter what. Owning that 
role, owning success.”
Bench 
production 
has 
been 
integral 
to 
Michigan’s 
9-0 
start 
to 
the 
season. 
With a roster 
littered 
with 
skilled hitters, 
Hutchins 
has 
taken 
to 
fluidity in an 
attempt to get 
the 
most 
out 
of the team’s 
offensive talent. 
Hutchins 
has 
embraced 
flexibility, showing an affinity 
for mixing and matching, not 
hesitant to yank starters in 
favor of substitutes. 
So far, it’s a tactic that has 
paid 
dividends. 
Freshman 
utility player Lauren Esman 
is the latest testament — she 
followed Bump with a pinch-
hit home run of her own on 
Sunday, this one a go-ahead 
grand slam. 
“One thing we’ve been doing 
well is we’re very engaged,” 

Hutchins said. “Player for 
player, not just the kids who 
are in the game. Everybody 
has a role. Everybody on the 
team has a role throughout the 
game. If you’re not a starter, 
then you’re either going to be 
a pinch-runner, pinch-hitter 
or you may come in as the next 
pitcher. You just need to be 
ready.”
Being ready is, then again, 
the most difficult component 
of coming off the bench. To 
compensate for the fact that 
pinch-hitters are unable to 
thoroughly warm up, Hutchins 
has encouraged her players to 
be aggressive at the dish. It’s 
an approach that Esman put 
to use with her grand slam 
coming on the first pitch she 
saw. 
“I saw that 
pitch on video,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“It 
was 
downtown. A lot 
of kids take that 
because 
they 
just want to see 
one.”
Hutchins, as 
made clear by 
her 
drawn-out 
pronunciation 
of 
‘see 
one,’ 
doesn’t care for merely taking 
a pitch. 
Rather, she stresses that 
her 
players 
stay 
engaged 
throughout 
the 
game 
by 
treating each pitch as their 
own. Everybody in the dugout 
can play every pitch in a sort 
of 
individual 
simulation. 
Track it. Make the decision 
for yourself. Become prepared. 
Breed confidence. 
When 
the 
real 
opportunity 
knocks, taking 
the first pitch 
is 
no 
longer 
necessary to get 
into the flow of 
the game. 
“When 
I’m 
watching 
a 
game, 
I 
just 
think of myself 
in the box every time somebody 
gets up,” Esman said. “What 
would I do with the pitch that 
is given to them, what things 
would I do with it — would I 
take it, would I swing? I just 
put myself in their shoes.”
Staying 
engaged 
has 
become a teamwide initiative, 
embraced by every player. 
Success has, in turn, become 
the expectation. 
“When you get your chance, 
you step up,” Hutchins said. 
“Cause everybody is one pitch 
away from being a starter.”

Every year, the seniors on a 
team graduate and the freshmen 
move in. And along with the 
normal 
first-year 
worries, 
freshman athletes are sometimes 
expected to fill those senior gaps.
For some, it’s a crushing 
pressure, and they never get 
the chance to see the field. For 
Michigan softball, it hasn’t been 
a problem — specifically for 
infielder Julia Jimenez and utility 
player Lauren Esman.
With six Wolverine seniors 
graduating last season, perhaps the 
largest hole left to fill was former 
second baseman Faith Canfield’s 
spot. With multiple candidates 
for the position, it’s been a toss-
up between sophomore infielder 
Morgan Overaitis and Jimenez. 
But this weekend, it seems the 
spot was closer to being solidified.
Jimenez 
has 
quickly 
established herself as the most 
viable candidate to start at second 
base. Starting at the top of the 
diamond for all four games this 
past weekend at the ACC/Big Ten 

Challenge, Jimenez has continued 
to prove her ability to perform. 
She’s meshed well with the 
rest of the infield, especially 
with junior shortstop Natalia 
Rodriguez, her counterpart in the 
middle.
“She came ready to play,” 
Rodriguez said. “I see that heart 
in her, she’s got a good IQ of 
the game. We’ve gelled pretty 
nicely in the middle, we have a 
little handshake. Also just on the 
mental aspect she asks a lot of 
questions and tries to know the 
game better. She’s a good second 
baseman.”
Defensively, Jimenez had six 
putouts and three assists on the 
weekend. She also contributed to 
a double play and had no errors. 
“She fits right in,” Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins said. “She’s 
comfortable, she’s competitive, 
she just has a great presence on 
the field. She’s actually a natural 
leader. We’re looking to find a way 
to put our bats in the game, but 
she really gives a good presence 
out there as a freshman. She 
doesn’t act like a freshman, I 
don’t even think she knows she’s 

a freshman.”
Her ability to play above her 
grade level and establish herself as 
a consistent face in the lineup this 
early in the season, according to 
Hutchins, will be instrumental in 
her potential success throughout 
the rest of the season. As one 
of the only freshmen seeing 
consistent defensive playing time, 
she’s opening up the idea of a 
breakout freshman season.
On the other side of the plate, 
Esman has shone.
On Sunday, the Wolverines 
found themselves tied for only 
the second time this season 
against Louisville. Calling upon 
Esman, Hutchins entered her 
into the lineup as a pinch-hitter 
for Rodriguez. In only her second 
collegiate at-bat, Esman shocked 
everyone with a grand slam. 
Adding four runs to Michigan’s 
total, and giving her a .500 batting 
average, the freshman showcased 
her capabilities at the plate.
“Kids like Lauren Esman are 
only going to get better if they 
play every pitch,” Hutchins said. 
“And everybody in that dugout 
can play every pitch of the game, 

and if they wait until the first time 
they see a pitch is when get their 
chance they’re not going to be 
ready. She swung at the first pitch 
and belted it.”
Esman’s potential to step-up 
with timely hits will be a quality 
that makes her hard to not put in 
lineups. If she can continue her 
success at the plate, that potential 
becomes a stabilizing and potent 
reality.
“Lauren’s a good hitter, I 
recruited her because I thought 
she was our kind of hitter,” 
Hutchins said. “She’s gotta learn 
hitting at this game, and pitching 
at this game, but we’d certainly 
like to get a lot of these young kids 
these bats. We’ve got a lot of good 
young talent, so it is our goal to 
get them in, it’s just a matter of, 
in tight games sometimes you go 
with what you know.”
Tight games are bound to 
happen throughout a season, but 
being able to look toward younger 
position 
players 
could 
prove 
instrumental — not only in the 
Wolverines’ early-season match-
ups, but even further down the 
line.

Michigan’s defense begins to fall into place

With two outs in the bottom 
of the ninth inning on Saturday, 
Michigan was on the cusp of an 
8-5 victory over Cal Poly. The 
bases were loaded when the 
Mustangs’ Nick Marinconz fired 
a chopper down the left side off a 
pitch from freshman right-hander 
Cameron Weston. For a second, it 
seemed a tied game may have been 
in the cards.
But 
junior 
shortstop 
Jack 
Blomgren met the ball where it 
bounced and rocketed it toward 
fifth-year 
senior 
Matthew 
Schmidt at first base to end the 
game.
The team’s defensive sharpness, 
exhibited 
by 
Blomgren 
and 
Schmidt in that game-ending 
play, was a useful complement 
to Weston’s first career save on 
Saturday. It also demonstrated the 
likelihood that defense will be a 
crucial part of Michigan’s winning 
equation.
The 
Wolverines’ 
coaching 
staff has taken an approach that 
emphasizes the infield defense’s 
importance to giving pitchers 
a degree of comfortability and 
providing the offense with some 
cover. 
“That was just the game plan 
that (pitching coach Chris) Fetter 
came to all the pitchers with,” 
junior right-hander Blake Beers 
said following his start against 
Cal Poly. “We have a lot of trust in 
our defense behind us and getting 
ahead was crucial to beating these 
hitters.”
Blomgren, 
now 
an 
upperclassman and elected as 
the team’s captain, anchors this 
season’s reinvigorated defense. 
Against Cal Poly, Vanderbilt and 
Arizona State, he managed to 
extinguish hit after hit with a 
swipe of his glove.
“I really like our infield defense, 
highlighted by Jack Blomgren,” 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich said. 
“I think he’s a star … a tough dude, 
just a playmaker, and any coach 
would want to have him.”

On 
Sunday 
evening, 
his 
dominance was on full display 
against the Sun Devils — who 
are renowned nationwide for 
their power hitters, like Spencer 
Torkelson, who was ranked by 
Baseball America as 2020’s top 
college prospect.
After a leadoff single in the 
eighth inning, trailing by three 
runs, Arizona State had its most 
powerful 
batters, 
including 
Torkelson, on deck. Sophomore 
reliever Jack White had a daunting 
task ahead of him. In a play 
echoing the Wolverines’ final out 
against Cal Poly, the Sun Devils’ 
Drew Swift knocked a fast-moving 
grounder 
toward 
a 
sprinting 
Blomgren. He then lobbed it 
straight 
to 
sophomore 
Riley 
Bertram at second base, who in 
turn connected to Schmidt at first 
to secure a double play and largely 
eliminate Arizona State’s threat.
“He’s as good as they come,” 
junior right-hander Jeff Criswell 
said. “He’s the heart of the infield 
and he’s done a great job with 
(freshman third baseman) Teddy 
Burton and Riley Bertram to his 
right and left, both newer guys 
this year, and helped bring them 
along.

“As a pitcher, it’s definitely a 

great feeling to have those guys 
behind you.”
Schmidt, 
who 
before 
this 
weekend had seen only eight 
career starts at Michigan with 
just one last season, seemed right 
at home as the Wolverines’ new 
starter at first base. Riding high 
off his game-winning home run 
against 
Vanderbilt 
on 
Friday 
evening, he gelled effectively with 
his fellow infielders. 
“Matt 
Schmidt 
had 
been 
patiently 
waiting 
to 
get 
his 
opportunity at first base,” Criswell 
said. “We saw new guys stepping 
up, and I think that was kind of the 
storyline throughout the entire 
weekend.” 
Schmidt, for his part, has 
bought in to Michigan’s defensive 
emphasis. 
“With (Nick) Schnabel, our 
infield coach, we take pride in 
that,” he said. “I think when one 
person makes a good play it feeds 
off to the rest of us … We don’t 
want our pitchers making any 
more extra pitches so we try and 
have their back.”
Among 
the 
“newer 
guys” 
pointed out by Criswell was 
Danny Zimmerman, who took on 

a new role at left field, where over 
the weekend Michigan’s outfield 
looked quite different than it did 
last season. Freshman Clark Elliot 
started in right field in all four of 
the weekend’s games, while senior 
Christian Bullock alternated with 
junior Jordan Nwogu in center 
field. 
Nwogu, whose starts last year 
were mostly at DH, has spoken of 
his self-appointed goal to be a great 
defender. The depth and flexibility 
of the outfield, especially in light 
of 
junior 
centerfielder 
Jesse 
Franklin’s early absence after 
a skiing incident, will also be 
an important component of the 
team’s success.
“I like the depth of some of 
our position players, some of the 
interchangeable parts, especially 
in the outfield,” Bakich said.
As Michigan works to replace 
noticeable gaps in its lineup made 
by departing seniors since last 
season, the defense will prove 
necessary to reinforce its efforts. 
But the importance of defence is 
by no means a new mindset for the 
team. Criswell summed it up well.
“That’s 
what 
we 
really 
stress here — defense wins 
championships.”

Simpson’s 3-point shooting a boon

For 
a 
while 
now, 
it’s 
been evident that Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
has 
transformed the Wolverines’ 
offense to live by one principle: 
If you’re open, shoot your shot.
This wheeling-and-dealing 
style of play has led to a 
much faster-paced Michigan 
team that consistently runs 
the score up far past season 
averages of years past. While 
the philosophy clearly favors 
the team’s best shooters in its 
application, any guard who 
is not known for his prolific 
shooting ability may be placed 
in an uncomfortable situation, 
stuck between wanting to take 
the open shot and wanting 
to generate the most high-
percentage opportunity for the 
team.
Over the course of this 
season, this has been the 
predicament of senior guard 
Zavier Simpson.
Simpson 
— 
assuredly 
not known for his shooting 
prowess — has been trapped 
between the decision to take 
the open 3-point shot or carry 
on with one of the other 
options he is more comfortable 
with, including driving to the 
hoop or finding another open 
man.
But 
in 
an 
unexpected 
development, 
the 
veteran 
guard has added an effective 
3-point shot to his arsenal, 
elevating 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense. The senior made this 
addition even more apparent 
on Wednesday, when he hit 
two threes in the opening four 
minutes to ignite Michigan’s 
offense in its eventual 60-52 
win over Rutgers.
To be sure, this is unlike 
any development Simpson has 
shown before. While the team 
captain has shown progress 
and diversified his skill set 
with each year on the team, 
his shooting was always a sore 

spot.
For 
instance, 
after 
his 
sophomore season, Simpson 
added a now-patented hook 
shot to his shot selection. 
Simpson’s 
main 
source 
of 
offense came around the rim 
where he would consistently 
drive to the basket, so this shot 
— while unconventional — was 
in the realm of possibility given 
his skillset.
But 
3-point 
shooting? That 
was somebody 
else’s problem.
Before 
this 
season, 
Simpson 
was 
a career 28.5 
percent 3-point 
shooter. 
But 
the 
senior 
has 
taken 
great strides and is shooting 
a respectable 37 percent from 
beyond the arc — enough to 
add a paragraph in the scouting 
report 
about 
his 
shooting 
ability. It’s clear, though, that 
this uptick not only in the 
amount of 3s taken per game 
but the amount of makes stems 
from Howard.
“Every shot that goes in is 
important, but it’s good to see 
the ball go in,” Howard said. 
“When they went under the 
screen, he was wide open. I 

wanted him to take it. If he 
would’ve missed those two 
shots, I would say take the third 
shot. Any player, when they see 
the ball go in, it becomes an 
ocean sometimes.”
The 
increase 
in 
3-point 
shots 
could 
be 
attributed 
to 
confidence, 
as 
Howard 
suggests — confidence in his 
own shot selection, confidence 
from his coaches 
— or it could 
be the natural 
marriage 
of 
muscle memory 
and 
instincts. 
After 
all, 
the 
amount 
of 
3-pointers 
Simpson 
has 
taken in practice 
or just shooting 
around 
over 
the years is essentially an 
incalculable number. 
Perhaps that is why this 
new development is not as 
surprising to his teammates 
and coaches.
“It’s nothing new, he’s a 
smart enough player to know 
where the reads are,” Howard 
said. “Any time a guy steps off 
you and you’re able to line it 
up, massage the ball, line the 
seams up and shoot it, it’s great. 
“He was confident enough to 
take the shot; the ball went in.”

Johnson growing as a team leader

An hour before Wednesday’s 
game against Illinois, Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico pulled 
Akienreh Johnson aside. The 
senior guard — after watching 
her best friend go down with 
an injury, the emotional leader 
of the team follow suit and the 
best player on the team battle 
through her own setbacks — 
had seen her responsibility on 
the team grow exponentially 
over the course of the last few 
weeks.
Barnes Arico wanted more 
from Johnson. Wanted her to 
take over the emotion on the 
team, to fight and inspire the 
rest of her teammates.
After 
the 
shootaround, 
Johnson did what she always 
did — meditate. For fifteen 
minutes, she went over what 
Barnes Arico told her, then the 
plays and her role. She ran over 
and over what she needed to do 
in her head, playing out every 
scenario that could happen in 
the game. What if she’s hot? 
What if she’s not? What does 
she need to do to make sure the 
team wins?
On Illinois’ first possession, 
both of Michigan’s bigs were 
pulled up to the top of the 
3-point line, and the Fighting 
Illini 
point 
guard, 
Brandi 
Beasley, tried to lob a pass over 
the top of them — and would 
have connected for an easy two 
points, if not for Johnson. She 
sniffed it out before the pass 
even began, taking two steps 
and knocking down the pass.
“It’s not really about your 
length, it’s about how hard 
you’re going to play,” Johnson 
said. “But I’m not going to lie — 
my length really does help it out 
a little bit, gives me a little extra 
step to get back and get those 
tips.”
It was decided, then, that her 
game would be defensive.
Johnson racked up three 
steals in the first quarter, often 

times being the only thing 
between a hot Illini and a 
bucket.
While the Wolverines fought 
to keep in the game, Johnson 
took every opportunity she 
could to be the emotional 
boost they needed. Handing 
out high fives between plays, 
congratulating players on the 
tiniest thing, she did exactly 
what Barnes Arico needed her 
to.
“She’s stepped up to that 
challenge,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I think she understands what 
it takes to be successful and 
that’s playing with a certain 
type of intensity and a certain 
type of fire. It doesn’t mean 
just shooting the basketball and 
scoring a ton of points, but we 
need to establish ourselves with 
that kind of fire and energy.”
Added sophomore guard Amy 
Dilk: “She’s grown into a great, 
great leader, She has the ability 
to use her voice. It’s tough 
sometimes, when you’re in the 
motion of the game, and you’re 
thinking about 20 different 
things, you like lose your voice 
sometimes. … AK mastered that, 
and her voice on the court, she’s 
a great leader, she’s a great vocal 
leader.”
And then, despite it seemingly 
being 
another 
game 
where 
Johnson would, nearly single-
handedly, limit the production 

of an opposing team, she did 
something 
that’s 
becoming 
more and more common for her: 
scoring.
Her seven first-quarter points 
led the team, and when it looked 
like it would be impossible to 
keep up with Illinois’ explosive 
shooting, 
she 
pump 
faked, 
sending a defender flying past 
her. Her second look clear, the 
ball soared in an arc from the 
corner, giving Michigan a big 
three and narrowing the deficit 
to five, in a game the Wolverines 
would eventually win, 80-59.
In the five games since 
sophomore 
guard 
Danielle 
Rauch’s injury — the team’s 
biggest emotional leader — 
Johnson has scored in double 
digits four times. She’s thrown 
up wild shots that fell despite 
all laws of physics. She’s made 
big 3-pointers when the team’s 
needed her to. She’s sparked 
easy transition buckets that 
shifted momentum with her 
steals.
As the season has progressed, 
Barnes Arico has asked more 
and more from the captain of 
her team. To lock down the 
most potent offensive threat in 
the conference, to replace the 
rebounds of the team’s second-
best rebounder, to get better 
and better.
Every time, Johnson has met 
those expectations.

Slaker’s success leading Wolverines

Jake Slaker finished his lap 
around the ice with a deadpan 
look on his face. The senior 
forward had scored the opening 
goal Friday at Munn Ice Arena, 
and made it a point to turn to 
the Michigan State student 
section.
Until that point, the arena 
had been moderately loud. The 
Michigan hockey team likes to 
joke Munn is a library in terms 
of atmosphere, but the jeers and 
chants rained from all around, 
contrary to its defamation.
And after his goal, Slaker 
faced the student section and 
brought a single finger to his 
lips — doing what any person 
disturbed in a library would do.
“Shhh,” Slaker said, silencing 
the rowdy crowd. 
He skated away with a smirk. 
It was a long time coming. He 
was finally playing with a level 
of confidence that matched his 
skill. He was finally producing.
The silencer was by all means 
intended for the attendees, but 
in a sense, it was aimed at the 
doubters, the skeptics who were 
questioning if his production 
would ever come after a rough 
first half of the season.
Slaker was held without a 
goal in the first ten games of the 
year and had just three goals 
heading into Winter break. 
Since the break, however, he’s 
scored nine goals and tacked 

on eight assists, bringing the 
impact he had been expecting 
to bring all year.
And as he’s found success, so 
has the team. Of the nine games 
he’s scored in, 
the Wolverines 
have 
won 
eight 
— 
he’s 
contributing, 
and Michigan’s 
reaping 
the 
rewards of his 
hot streak.
“When 
(seniors) 
get 
going, it gets 
the entire team 
going,” 
senior 
forward Will Lockwood said 
Jan. 21. “When Slakes gets 
going, he brings a lot of energy 
in the locker room. I always 
say our team is 
doing the best 
when 
Slakes 
is putting the 
puck 
in 
the 
net.”
It’s 
only 
natural 
that 
when 
goals 
are 
scored, 
teams 
find 
success, 
but 
Slaker’s 
goals 
in 
particular 
bring an unmatched vigor that 
trickles down through the rest 
of the team. 
It’s hard to bring positivity 
when there’s no production 
to back it up, even more so 

when the team loses. But as 
he’s scoring, he’s making sure 
people know. His impact lies 
not only in the goals he scores, 
but in the energy he brings after 
each one.
“Energy 
and 
energy 
breeds 
energy,” 
senior 
defenseman 
Luke 
Martin 
said. “Positivity 
creates 
positivity, 
and 
the more we’ve 
been able to have 
success, 
we’ve 
just kind of built 
on it, and it’s 
snowballing now and you know, 
we’re rolling. 
“I think (Slaker and team 
success) 
definitely 
have 
something to do 
with each other.”
It’s 
how 
he 
built his game, 
a 
development 
that’s 
jumped 
since the start of 
his 
Wolverines’ 
career. 
With 
some 
of 
the 
best hockey his 
teammates have 
ever seen out of 
him coming in 
the last couple months, Slaker 
plays a team-complementary 
playstyle. He plays in the 
gritty areas. He cleans up the 
rebounds. He goes after the 
physicality of the game with no 
hesitation.
“He’s not forcing anything,” 
Martin said. “Not to say that 
he was in the first half, but 
now he’s taking what’s coming 
to him and he’s not, you know, 
forcing anything or cheating 
the game, he’s playing the game 
the right way and on the right 
side and he’s having success.”
He’s putting up numbers, 
but not empty numbers. His 
goals make an impact, and as 
he lined up his 12th goal of the 
season Friday, the final nail in 
the coffin in the third period, 
he put his hand to his ear to 
hear if there were any more 
complaints.
Not a single one could be 
heard.
