Court ruling
brings new
energy to
GS fiht

University President Mary Sue Coleman discusses higher education issues at the Lansing Regional Chamber Economic Club in East Lansing, Michigan Thursday
Coleman talks higher ed.

Speech to economic
club addresses
affordability, cost
containment efforts
By JENNIFER CALFAS

LANSING - University
President Mary Sue Coleman
addressed the Lansing Region-
al Chamber Economic Club
Thursday about the importance
of public research institutions
of higher education as federal
and state support dwindles.

The Lansing Regional Cham-
ber Economic Club is devoted
to enhancing economic growth
and professional development
across the state, according to
the club's website. The group
hosts many guestspeakers each
year to provide diverse per-
spectives on issues facing the
state.
Coleman called upon attend-
ees to understand the signifi-
cance of higher education in
the state's development.
"It's the single most driv-
ing force," Coleman said. "It's
why we choose to work here, to
develop our careers and learn
more."

In her speech, Coleman cited
a report that revealed states
are spending 28 percent less on
college students than in 2008.
However, Gov. Rick Snyder's
(R) budget proposal for the
2015 fiscal year will increase
state appropriation for public
higher education institutions
by 6.1 percent - the largest
increase in state funding since
2001. The club hosted Snyder
in 2011, garnering nearly 850
guests.
Coleman lauded Snyder's
budget proposal, adding that it
will expand the state's national
impact drastically.
"We have a chance here in

Michigan to recapture national
leadership with the growth of
our public universities," Cole-
man said. "I firmly believe that
states that do not invest in high-
er education will not win the
21st century, and I want desper-
ately for Michigan to win."
Cost-containment and
affordability were highlighted
several times in Coleman's
speech as she described sev-
eral of the University's primary
goals for the future.
To help accomplish these
aspirations, the University
launched the Victors for Michi-
gan fundraising campaign with

Appellate judge says
parts of a 2012 law
banning unionization
are impermissible
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
After a recent court ruling, the
debate surrounding the collec-
tive bargaining rights of gradu-
ate student research assistants
has gained new energy. The Feb.
6 district court decision declared
parts of a 2012 law barring GSRA
unionization unconstitutional.
However, the decision does not
mean total victory for union orga-
nizers. Instead, it clears the way
for the Graduate Employees Orga-
nization to challenge the exist-
ing classification that prevents
GSRAs from unionizing.
The provisions found uncon-
stitutional last week are a part of
Public Act 45, which was signed
by Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in March
2012. This law included a provi-
sion declaring that GSRAs were
not entitled to unionization.
The provision was thrown out
by the court on the grounds that
it violated the state constitu-
tion's "change of purpose clause."

Since the bill's original draft was
meant to address the power of
emergency financial managers
for municipalities - not collec-
tive bargaining rights - the court
deemed the GSRA amendment
unconstitutional.
The GEO, in partnership with
the Michigan state affiliate of the
American Federation of Teachers,
first reopened the issue of GSRA
unionization in summer 2011,
when it began making plans to
include GSRAs in their represen-
tation.
GSRAs are currently banned
from unionizing in the state due
to a 1981 ruling by the Michigan
Employment Relations Com-
mission. The commission decid-
ed that GSRAs are not public
employees and thus are not eli-
gible to hold a union contract as
a collective group. To pave the
way for unionization, organizers
would need to lobby for GSRAs to
be classified as public employees.
After an original petition to
MERC asking for reconsideration
of the issue was dismissed, the
group secured a special admin-
istrative hearing on the issue in
response to a second petition in
November 2011.
However, shortly after that
decision, State Sen. Randy Rich-

RESIDENCE HALLS
Gelato station
in East Quad
finally opens

Much-delayed ice
cream station will
have grand opening
at 4 p.m. today
By AMABEL KAROUB
DailyStaffReporter
East Quad Residence Hall's
gelato bar is here - but actually.
East Quad's long-awaited gela-
to bar opened in the Java Blue
Cafd, and its official inauguration
will be Friday at 4 p.m. with free
samples and coupons.
The gelato bar features about
12 flavors - including raspberry,
strawberry, raspberry chocolate,
chocolate chip, cinnamon, mint,
natural vanilla bean, chocolate
and chocolate chipotle. East
Quad Sous Chef Jeremy Moser
said the gelato will be made with
all local and fresh ingredients.
He added that the gelato will cost
about three dollars for a three-
ounce cup.
"We're just excited we're mak-
ing gelato here from scratch,"
Moser said. "It's a U of M prod-
uct. It will only get better with
feedback from the students and
everybody else."
The prospect of a gelato bar in
East Quad gained a lot of atten-
tion during the residence hall's
renovations during the 2012 to
2013 academic year, but was not
realized until recently.

The gelato bar was originally
scheduled to open at the start of
lastsemester. LSA freshman Alec
Rosenbaum said housing staff
members' silence on the sub-
ject last semester upset him and
other residents.
"I was very disappointed, just
like everyone else," Rosenbaum
said. "I was told way back at
orientation that we were going
to have a gelato bar when this
place opened. Then I moved in
and there wasn't a gelato bar, and
then they didn't really say any-
thing. The thing that frustrated
me the most is that they didn't
really tell people what was hap-
pening."
Rumors have been flying about
the reason for the unfulfilled
gelato promise. LSA freshman
Joseph Ambrose speculated
about why the gelato machine's
installation took so long.
"They brought the machine,
they had it shipped from Italy,"
Ambrose said "There's a whole
debate whether they broke it or if
it was the company's fault."
Peter Logan, communications
director for University Hous-
ing, provided a clearer account
of what happened. The gelato
machine was part of a bid pack-
age that included all of East
Quad's kitchen and counter
equipment. The machine was
faulty when EastQuad received it
in the fall, so housing staff decid-
ed to exchange the machine at no

Sing-along version
of R. Kelly's 'magnus
opum' a Valentine's
Day treat
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
Since the earliest days of
mass-produced popular cul-
ture, onlya select few works by

a handful of trailblazers have
managed to transcend general
societal acceptance and enter
into the increasingly trea-
sured realm of "cult classic."
R. Kelly's magnum opus, the 33
chapter hip hopera "Trapped
in the Closet," is not only an
undeniable cult classic - it is a
hilarious, gripping, absurd and
addicting masterpiece of sex,
deception, drama and emotion
that is blended together with
an extra-special R. Kelly twist.

Gay priests? Check. Stut-
tering pimps? Of course. Phi-
landering midgets hiding in
cabinets? You betcha. R. Kelly
voicing an entire cast of char-
acters ranging from a nosy old
lady to an ex-convict named
Twan? Yes, yes, absolutely yes.
This Friday, on Valentine's
Day no less, the State Theater
will be hosting a "Trapped in
the Closet" SING-A-LONG for
Kelly diehards and newbies

According to one study of nat-

After leadership
purge in isolated
country, China's
influence unclear
BEIJING (AP) - U.S. Sec-
retary of State John Kerry is in
China on a difficult diplomatic
mission.
Kerry is meeting senior Chi-
nese officials on Friday in Beijing
to seek their help in bringing a
belligerent North Korea back to
nuclear disarmament talks.
Atthe same time, he's demand-
ing that China roll back a series of
increasingly aggressive steps it
has taken to assert itself in ter-
ritorial disputes with its smaller
neighbors.
Kerry faces a tough sell on both
counts.
The extent of China's influ-
ence with North Korea is unclear
following a purge in the isolated
country's leadership.
And, China has angrily dis-
missed U.S criticism over its
moves in the East and South
China seas that have alarmed U.S.
allies like Japan and the Philip-
pines.
In Seoul, South Korea, on
Thursday, Kerry made clear the
Obama administration is putting
new emphasis on getting North
Korea back to stalled six-nation
talks aimed atcgetting it to give up
nuclear weapons.
"Let me be clear," Kerry said.
"The United Stateswill not accept
North Korea as a nuclear-armed
state. We will not accept talks for
the sake of talks. And the DPRK
must show that it will negotiate
and live up to its commitments
regarding denuclearization."
Efforts toward that end, he
said, would rely heavily on China,
North Korea's only friend, put-
ting pressure on Pyongyang.
"China has a unique and criti-
cal role that it can play," he said.
"No country has a greater poten-
tial to influence North Korea's
behavior than China, given their

extensive trading relationship
with the North."
But China's leverage with the
North is being tested.
Diplomats say Beijing received
no prior warning ahead of the
December arrest and execution
of North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who
had been considered Pyongyang's
point man on China affairs and
was a strong promoter of free
trade zones being set up along
their mutual border.
That came on the heels of
Pyongyang's snubbing of Beijing's
wishes when it conducted a mis-
sile test in late 2012, followed by
the underground detonation of a
nuclear device last spring.
Jang's removal was seen as
depriving Beijing of its chief
conduit into the North Korean
regime and in the weeks that fol-
lowed the leadership found itself
at a loss as to how to proceed. A
delegation of Chinese diplomats
led by the Foreign Ministry's
deputy head of Asian affairs vis-
ited Pyongyang last week in a
sign that Beijing was attempting
to renew dialogue with Kim's
government, although it remains
to be seen whether the North was
any more receptive to China's
pleas to return to the nuclear
talks.
Those discussions involving
the twoKoreasthe United States,
China, Russia and Japan, broke
down at the end of 2008 and U.S.
officials say they see no point of
restarting talks until Pyongyang
shows an authentic desire to
make good on its prior commit-
ments to dismantle its nuclear
programs.
Meanwhile, making the U.S.
case for restraint and clarifica-
tion on the competing territorial
claims and China's bitter dispute
with Japan may be even tougher
for Kerry.
Since sometimes violent anti-
Japanese protests rocked major
cities in late 2012, Beijing has
continually stepped up its rheto-
ric against Tokyo, dispatching its
diplomats to make China's case

in the global media and at inter-
national forums, even dogging
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe's recent trip to Africa.
Recent weeks have seen
China's ambassador to London
compare Japan to the evil Lord
Voldemort of the Harry Potter
books in the pages of Britain's
Daily Telegraph newspaper. On
Thursday,theofficialChinaDaily
newspaper devoted a half page to
grievances against Japan, while
the Foreign Ministry revived
the case of a 2010 confrontation
between a Chinese fishing boat
and Japanese coast guard ships
to demand an apology and com-
pensation from Tokyo.
More worrisome, Chinese
patrol vessels have maintained a
more-or-less constant presence
in waters surrounding the dis-
puted Diaoyu islands in the East
China Sea, forcing the Japanese
coast guard to go onthe defensive
to avoid a clash.
Chinese ships have also
stepped up their presence in the
South China Sea, particularly in
regards to the Philippines, which
is seen by Beijing as weak and
overly dependent on the U.S. for
protection. Diplomats are con-
cerned that Beijing may be plan-
ning to declare an air defense
zone above those heavily tra-
versed waters, further raising the
chances of confrontation with
American surveillance planes
and other military flights.
U.S. officials traveling with
Kerry said he would urge the
Chinese to show restraint, cool
down its rhetoric and actions,
and clarify its claims consistent
with international law.
"The perception in the region
and in the United States that is
generated by the incremental
actions that China has been tak-
ing ... is one of a country that is
asserting its position through
extra-legal and non-diplomatic
means," one official said. "That's
not a good image of China, and
it is not a pattern of behavior by
China that the U.S. or others
want to see."

Snyder names John
Roberts new state
budget director
Gov. Rick Snyder on Thursday
named his deputy chief of staff
as the new state budget director
because John Nixon is returning
to his home state for a job at the
University of Utah.
John Roberts, 32, will become
budget chief effective March 1.
Nixon also directs the Depart-
ment of Technology, Manage-
ment and Budget. That job will be
filled by David Behen, 44, Michi-
gan's chief information officer
who will still have his informa-
tion technology responsibilities.
Nixon was the state of Utah's
top budget officer before being
recruited to Michigan after Sny-
der was elected. In three years
at the helm, he has been cred-
ited with helping the Republican
governor wipe out a structural $1
billion-plus deficit and sock away
hundreds of millions into savings.
PHILADELPHIA
Snow-storm hits
the Northeast;
South remains icy
Yet another storm paralyzed
the Northeast with heavy snow
and sleet Thursday, giving the
winter-weary that oh-no-not-
again feeling, while hundreds of
thousands across the ice-encrust-
ed South waited in the cold for
the electricity to come back on.
At least 21 deaths were blamed
on the treacherous weather,
including that of a pregnant
woman struck by a mini-snow-
plow in a New York City parking
lot as she loaded groceries into
her car.
The sloppy mix of snow and
face-stinging sleet grounded
more than 6,500 flights and
closed schools and businesses
as it made its way up the heavily
populated Interstate 95 corridor,
where shoveling out has become a
weekly - sometimes twice-week-
ly - chore.

Democrats want to
force House vote
on minimum wage
House Democrats said Thurs-
day they will try to highlight
GOP resistance to a higher
minimum wage with a tactical
maneuver meant to bring new
attention to an issue they con-
sider a political winner.
House Democratic leader
Nancy Pelosi said her party
will push a "discharge petition"
when Congress returns from its
recess on Feb. 24. If Democrats
can persuade roughly two dozen
Republicans to sign the petition,
it would force GOP leaders to
allow a House vote on the wage

issue.
Most Republican lawmakers
oppose a higher minimum wage.
They say it prompts employers to
cut down on hiring, a claim Dem-
ocrats dispute.
It's by no means clear Demo-
crats can collect enough signa-
tures in the House, where they
hold 200 seats to the Republi-
cans' 232. Three seats are vacant.

Volcano eruption

Indonesia airports
Volcanic ash from a major

First light brought clear the
extent of the overnight explo-

seemed to be a direct targeting
of the GEO's on-campus push to
include University GSRAs in its
representation.

"It was incredibly disappoint-
ing when the legislation passed,"
Skovron said. "We thought it was
veryvindictive."
It's unclear what will happen
in regard to the 2011 to 2012 pro-
ceedings now that the legislative
ban has been lifted. In a state-
ment, Ruthanne Okun, director of
the Michigan Bureau of Employ-
ment Relations, said no decision
on how to respond to the court's
decision has been made.
"The Michigan Employment
Relations Commission (MERC)
has not determined how it will
proceed following the recent
decision by U.S. District Court
Judge Goldsmith," Okun wrote.
"MERC is thoroughly review-
ing all available options before
it decides on its next course of
action."
Skovron said the GEO has
been carefully exploring several
potential paths of action as well,
and hasn't yet chosen which one
to follow.
"We're still sort of takingstock
of where we are," he said.
Another complication in the
matter is a potential appeal of
the district court's decision by
other groups who expressed
opposition in the past, such as

Michigan's attorney general Bill
Schuette (R) or the state legisla-
ture.
Students Against GSRA
Unionization, a University group,
also expressed opposition, but
SAGU founder Stephen Raiman
said the group does not have any
concrete plans in response to
the ruling, and probably will not
take action unless there's anoth-
er large pro-unionization push
on campus.
"We formed SAGU because
we want to just remain students
and we don't want to get involved
with politics and these things,"
Raiman said. "So we're not going
to become involved with anything
unless we feel like it's necessary;
we'd rather just stay out of it."
Skovron said the GEO is still
waiting to see whether an appeal
will occur before it decides on
what to do next, as that will fac-
tor into its deliberations. In the
meantime, he added that the
GEO will focus on continuing to
do what it considers its primary
function: organizing University
graduate students.
"We think it's time to bring
this issue back to campus, instead
of letting the legislature decide
for us," he said.

additional cost.
"It just wasn't a good
machine," Logan said. "So we
finally decided to replace it."
Despite the housing staff's
good intentions, many East

Quad residents are angry about
the long wait. LSA sophomore
Amelia Runco said she feels the
promise of gelato may be too
good to be true, adding that she
thinks there is widespread dis-
content with East Quad's din-
ing services.
"It better be delicious,"
Runco said. "We've waited long
enough for it to be good."

a $4 billion goal - $1 billion of
which will be dedicated solely to
student financial aid. In the world
of higher education, the campaign
remains one the largest fundrais-
ingendeavors of its kind. Harvard
University is in the middle of its
ambitious $6.5 billion fundraising
drive.
"It's tremendously impor-
tant for young people today and
tomorrow to get a great college
education without worrying
about taking on debt that's going
to stomp on their career path in
the future," Coleman said.
Coleman also mentioned Presi-
dent Barack Obama's visit to
Michigan State University Feb. 7
to sign the farm bill, which will
expand federal crop insurance.
She added that the choice to sign
the bill in Michigan serves as an
example of the significance of
public research institutions in the
national sphere.
"Leading public research uni-
versities play a role in the health
of our country," Coleman said.

Before her speech, Matthew
Anderson, the sales and mar-
keting manager for Hager Fox
Heating and Air Conditioning
Co., lauded Coleman for her phil-
anthropic efforts during her ten-
ure.
Coleman has consistently
donated her salary increases back
to financial aid each year. Addi-
tionally, Coleman and her hus-
band Kenneth Coleman donated
$1 million in October toward
global scholarships as part of the
fundraising campaign.
Several University officials
attended the event, including Lisa
Rudgers, vice president for global
communications and strategic
initiatives.
The Economic Club previously
hosted MSU President Lou Anna
Simon at its luncheon Jan. 28.
Deborah Muchmore, vice presi-
dent of the Marketing Resource
Group and chair of the Economic
Club, said the group hopes to
learn from Coleman and Simon
about the status of higher educa-
tion, specifically in the state of
Michigan.
"These schools play a vital role
here, not just locally, but state-

wide and around the world,"
Muchmore said. "We have taken
this opportunity to put a spot-
light on these two leaders who are
absolutely exceptional, remark-
able leaders."
As University President-elect
Mark Schlissel prepares to fill her
shoes this summer, Coleman also
mentioned plans for her upcom-
ing retirement.
Despite working in her role for
12 years, Coleman doesn't planto
take much of a break.
"I won't by lying on a beach
anywhere," she said jokingly.
Once she leaves, Coleman will
co-chair a project for the Ameri-
can Academy of Arts and Sciences
focusing on the significance of
public research universities. She
will also serve on the board of
several foundations, including as
a member of the National Insti-
tute of Health's advisory council.
Currently, Coleman serves on
the board of directors of Johnson
+ Johnson, which she joined in
2003.
As for her future in Ann Arbor,
Coleman plans to get a condo in
town so she can visit in the fall for
football games.

show up and who would really
ensure that it was a great seg-
ment," Manes said.
She said she met Stack at a
conference last year, which is
how she got interested in CPCs.
"She kind of mentored me in
how to get exposure, how tolet
people know the truth about
what a CPC is, and from there
it just kind of took off," Manes
said.
Manes said HBO contacted
Stack to work on an episode
about CPCs, and Stack then
directed the crew to Manes.
"I think it's great that it's
going to get into mainstream
media," Manes said. "I think
it's really, really important that
these stories are told as many
times as possible and that these
stories are widespread."
During the discussion,
stack took time to explain
CPCs and what she sees as
their dangers.
"Crisis pregnancy centers
are really the grassroots army
of the anti-abortion business,"
she said. "They're small orga-
nizations that their goal is to
be a step in between a woman
finding out she is pregnant and
actually interacting with an
abortion clinic."
Stack also discussed her
experience in undercover
operations, during which she
uses an audio recorder, a video
camera hidden in a purse and a
sample of urine to falsify a posi-

tive pregnancy test adminis-
tered by the CPC.
Manes said she has been
undercover five times and
plans to use audio and video
evidence from these operations
to expose the nature of CPCs to
University students. She added
that she hopes students will
learn what these organizations
really do and that CPCs will
begin to advertise themselves
truthfully.
"They call themselves
judgment-free, which they're
not," Manes said. "They call
themselves a place where they
can give you a wide range of
options, which they're not."
Manes said she grew up with
accessible sexual education -
something she was surprised
and upset to learn is not the
case for everyone.
"The problem is that CPCs
are furthering this," Manes
said. "'Young people don't
deserve to know about their
own lives, their own bodies and
we're going to tell them how to
make their decisions.' That's
what CPCs do."
Manes said her work is
focused in Ann Arbor, espe-
cially at the nearby CPC called
Arbor Vitae, but hopes to
expand in the future.
"People telling their stories
is an incredible way of tell-
ing the truth about what these
places really are, and I think
that HBO's highlighting it on
such a national stage is defi-
nitely a step in the right direc-
tion."
The second season of VICE
will air this spring on HBO.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The

stripped by the House. In Indi-
ana, a proposed constitutional
amendment must twice be
approved by the Legislature -
unchanged and in consecutive
biennial legislative sessions -
before making the ballot.
That means the proposed
ban, which sailed through the
GOP-controlled Legislature
during the 2011-2012 session,
won't make the November bal-
lot. The soonest it could go
before voters is now 2016.
But supporters vowed to
continue fighting. Micah
Clark, executive director of
the American Family Associa-
tion of Indiana, said: "We will
be back next year, pushing to

take this issue to the people of
Indiana."
Senate Minority Leader Tim
Lanane said Senate Democrats
also will do everything they
can to keep the issue off the
table.
"This is not something
future Hoosiers say is a good
idea," said Lanane, a Democrat
from Anderson. "It's not good
for the future of Indiana, and
it's not good for the future of
the nation."
Senate President Pro Tem

to continue the debate in 2015

Equal treatment for all students
Transgender children must be respected in public school policies
nn Arbor Public Schools officials have joined school board
administrators across the country in the discussion of unequal school
policies in an effort to protect the rights of transgender students.
Current school policies are generally non-discriminatory, but they don't address
issues such as a transgender student's right to choose his or her bathroom or
which gender's cabin to stay in on a field trip. While we commend the officials
for their dialogue, just having the discussion isn't enough. Ann Arbor schools
need to take substantive action to protect the rights of transgender students.

The (Marcus) Smart thing to say

U nder absolutely no
circumstances can
a player physically
react to a fan."
That
sentiment has
been repeated C
countless times
over the past few
days, as think
piece after think
piece has rolled JAMES
in discussing the BRENNAN
Marcus Smart
incident. Smart,
a 19-year-old
basketball player at Oklahoma State
University, shoved Texas Tech
University fan Jeff Orr after Orr
yelled something at him.
Looking at the tape, it's hard to
gather exactly what Orr actually
said, but rumors are buzzing that
Smart told his coaches Orr yelled a
racial slur; others claim they can see
Orrmouthingoutthe words "goback
to Africa." Orr denies saying either,
but admits that he said something he
shouldn't have.
To say that Orr definitely or prob-
ably used a racial slur is founded in
about as much evidence as saying he
didn't. Other players have alleged
that Orr is known for crossing the
line and that Lubbock, Texas is
notorious for racist fans, but Marcus
Smart is also a player with a well-
documented history of hot-headed-
ness. Maybe Orr used a slur, maybe
he didn't. What I think is more
important is the one-sided debate in
these think pieces about the appro-
priateness of Smart's response -
regardless of what Orr said.
For a moment, let's forget
the Marcus Smart incident and

just imagine it's any other Black
basketball player at any other
stadium. The player tumbles into the
stands and the fan tells him to "go
back to Africa," so the player shoves
him and runs back onto the court.
If I'm that kid's coach, I'd com-
mend him for having the restraint
not to clock that guy across the
face, too. But according to the
consensus opinion of sports com-
mentators, even if Orr did say some-
thing that crossed the line, Smart
couldn't react.
Why not?
To apply the standard "there is
no circumstance where a player can
react"is making a conscious choice to
be blind tothe pure hatred some peo-
ple still openly express and the deep
pain it causes others. When some-
one is called something as horrible
and hurtful as what Orr might have
called Smart, expecting that per-
son to restrain himself is completely
illogical. There is such a thing as
"fighting words" - words so hateful
and incendiary that, when personally
directed at someone, will provoke
hatred or violence right back. Calling
a 19-year-old Black kid the N-word a
foot from his face? Yeah, I would call
those fighting words.
I'm not a person of color, nor am I
gay, Jewish, a woman or of any other
identity that faces a hatred compa-
rable to what African Americans do.
There is no word someone can use
toward me that would sting quite
like a racist, sexist or homophobic
slur. It's not my job to tell some-
one with a different identity how
they should or shouldn't feel when
people spew hate at them. Even if I
were a woman or if I were Jewish, I
shouldn't tell someone who is Black

how to feel when they're called a
name, and vice versa. We don't know
the experiences, thoughts and feel-
ings of other people.
It's a totally unfair double
standard for people who experience
hatred to be expected to act with
uncompromising restraint. This
politically correct, violence-is-
never-okay ideology ignores the
realities of racial animus and hatred
in our society. It isn't 1947 anymore;
stop holding everyone to the Jackie
Robinson standard. Not everyone
can just sit there and ignore it when
someone angrily unloads racism on
a person they don't even know. I'm
not advocating for violence, but I'm
sure as hell notgoing to tell Marcus
Smart how to react if someone says
something hateful toward him.
Saying a situation like Smart's is
unwarranted in all circumstances
applies far too broad a brush.
If you're walking down the
street with a Black friend and some
random guy gets in his face and calls
him the N-word, what are you gonna
do? Yeah, we'd all hold our friend
back, tell him "he's not worth it" and
try to get out of there, but if he ends
up kicking this guy's ass for a couple
seconds, we wouldn't tell our friend
he "crossed a line" and that what he
did was unwarranted. In the heat
of the moment like that, some of us
may even jump in and help teach the
guy some manners.
People who express that kind of
personal, horrible hatred deserve
exactly what they get, and no one
should be made to feel guilty for
giving it to them.

Under current policy, transgender
schoolchildren in Ann Arbor are dealt with
on a case-by-case basis, and there are no
standards in place regarding the treatment
of these individuals. Nationally, no strategies
have been tested or standardized. The efforts
of AAPS officials to better accommodate the
needs of transgender students are positive
and forward-thinking. In Michigan, a
person'sgender is identifiedby his or her birth
certificate, but if a student is over the age of 18
or has his or her parent make a request, that
gender can be changed. Even though these
students aren't old enough to change their
gender without the consent of a parent, they
should be given the right to choose which
bathroom makes them most comfortable or
where to sleep on a field trip. By approving
new policies to help make their educational
environment more inclusive, school officials
will be working to create a positive school
experience for transgender students.
On Jan. 1, California was the first state to
enact new transgender policies for students
in public elementary, middle and high
schools. While students in California now
have equal access to school-based resources,
they also face some risks, including alienation
from friends, discrimination and bullying.
Some students are dissuaded from using
the bathrooms they want to use by the
fear of harassment. It's important for Ann
Arbor to make sure anti-bullying and anti-
discrimination policies are enforced before
transgender laws are implemented. Another

option to consider is using gender-neutral
bathrooms instead of having students choose
between male and female bathrooms.
Still, Michigan shouldn't hold back when
giving students the right to choose their
own gender. They should join other states
like California and Maine in pioneering
policies for transgender equality inside
and outside the classroom. California's law
states, "Students who identify as the opposite
sex can now choose which restroom to use,
which locker room to use and whether to play
on boys' or girls' sports teams." The Maine
Supreme Judicial Court also ruled on Jan.
30 that children should be allowed to use the
bathroomoftheirchoice. Currently, Michigan
doesn't have any laws that expressly ban
discrimination against transgender people,
but in 2007, former Gov. Jennifer Granholm
signed an executive order that prohibits
discrimination against transgender state
workers. These protections have remained in
effect even since Granholm left office.
As AAPS is working on these novel
transgender measures, other school districts
in Michigan may follow its lead. Implementing
equal rights for all students is a great issue
to be spending school board time, effort
and money on. Despite complications, such
as bullying and other students' discomfort,
Ann Arbor should be commended for taking
the initiative to give transgender students
equal rights. The discussion should then be
translated into real policy that will ensure the
rights of transgender students are protected.

POLINA FRADKIN I
Stop hating on snow

"Go back to Russia, Polina." That's what
people tell me when I say I love the snow.
Maybe it did somehow seep down from my
Russian roots, but there's something wonder-
ful that this eternal winter breeds in me.
Despite the thrashing snowy tempest, or
maybe because of it, I woke up this morning
struck with an impulse to write, along with
an unflappable sense of joyous motivation -
a perfect combination, if you ask me. I soon
realized I was walking through campus smil-
ing in the face of the frigid wind. What is
there to complain about? It's a scorcher today
- 19 whole degrees outside!
I bet that along your walk, trek or ice
skate to class today you cursed the snow, the
cold, the winter or maybe the entire state of
Michigan. After class this morning, I checked
my phone and wearily read through a slew
of weather condemnations sent to a group
message from my friends. I responded to the
group with something along the lines of, "As
slippery as it is, can we just take a moment
to appreciate how beautiful Michigan is and
how awesome it feels to walk through the
swirling snow between gorgeous buildings
with the bell tower chiming and how glorious
academia is in general?"
My friend Michelle's immediate response:
"A really sharp snowflake hit me right in the
eye today."
A while ago I read a New York Times

article, "The Longest Nights," by Timothy
Egan, that concisely summarizes the theory
of bad weather and its conduciveness to
creativity. When the blizzard strikes, people
escape to the indoors where their distractions
are limited. Within walls and under roofs
we sit and reflect while a white powder (or
brown slush) temporarily blankets reality.
Frosted windows stir the nostalgic soul.
Creative juices flow. Great works are born.
Productivity peaks. I'm presently at the cusp
of my third hour in the basement of Panera
and I've finished all of my reading for the
week, sent 10 or 15 outrageously overdue
e-mails and am now in the midst of furiously
typing words to form sentences to make up
the article you are now reading.
Even if you slipped on the way to class this
morning, look around and see the beauty
in this opportunity. Quit languishing in
weather-related sorrow. Turn that miserable
pit of despair into a well of creativity. Revel in
the crunch beneath your feet, and when you
get home, bake a batch of cookies that rival
MoJo's, or read the book that's been waiting
on the shelf for months. Take the weather
for what it is and make the best of it. As my
English professor Ralph Williams says, you're
just a guest in life. Wouldn't you hate to be an
ungrateful guest?

I am on a swing. Pushing off the
ground so hard it almost feels like
I can escape my loneliness and fly
away. It'srecess, first grade.Violently,
the rusty chains of the swingshudder
and stop. I fly off and out oftmy happy
place and onto the woodchips. I hate
the smell of woodchips. I look up to
see a group of white boys surround
me. They ask me if I know kung fu.
They throw punches before I can
answer. I don't know kungfu.
Another memory places me on
a baseball diamond, second grade.
A kickball game of girls versus boys
begins. I nervously ask if I can play
on the girls' team. Boys are mean and
all my friends are girls. Everyone,
includingthose on the team I wish to
be on, screams, "You're a girl! You're
a girl!" I don't understand why that's
an insult. I cry anyways.
As I walk away, I hear, "He
probably can't even see through his
tiny Asian eyes."
I'm six. I ask if I can play dress-
up and "house" with the girls, but
my teacher points me towards the
building blocks and toy cars, using
her notion of what it means to be
a boy as her compass. My compass
seems to be broken. Full of confusion
and resentment, I obey.
At an age when I am still too young
to understand how to coordinate my
own wardrobe, I learned what it feels
like to lust after another boy. I am a
Pokdmon Master. I am a child with
one hand in my dreams and another
in my fears. I am a pervert.
My parents are in the kitchen,
arguing. I am in my bedroom,
wrapped in blankets, holding onto
myself so tightly, I wonder how
much harder I will have to squeeze
in order to shrink into nothingness.
I listen to the sounds of hushed,
sharp Vietnamese being thrown
back and forth. The noises pierce
me like daggers. I struggle to
translate the words in my head. I
lose my own language through the
tears falling out of my eyes.
I hesitate to trust my own
memories, clumsily and crudely
pieced together in a fog of guessed
meanings and translations.
I wonder what it'd be like if a
benevolent white family swooped
in and rescued me into a Hallmark
happily ever after - the kind of
family that kissed each other goodbye
before leaving the house and prayed
to white invisible superheroes in the
sky before eating dinner.
It's in these situations where I
begin .to internalize my constant
desire to be someone other than
myself. All my life, I have always
wanted to be something other
than me.
I snap back to last semester. I'm
in a classroom, all eyes on me. The
professor repeats the question,
"What was growing up as a boy like
for you?" I am the only man of color. I
manage to stutter, "It was fine." Eyes
stay locked on me. I feel my queer and
yellow otherness fester. I nervously

[e so we can heal

look down at my hands and notice
the purple polish on my nails. IwishI
could disappear. I clear my throat, "I
can't really think of anything to say."
Even as I claim to be a proud queer
person of color, son of Asian immi-
grant warriors, heir to their sacrific-
es; even as I claim to be a humble and
resilient first-generation cash-poor
college student; even as I claim to be
an activist, an organizer, an educator,
and an advocate; even as I claim to
be made up of stars, all held together
by an inner fire with ancestral magic
fueling my spirit; even now as I write
these words, I hurt.
It is easier for me to rage and
be furious at society for being an
unforgiving place than to admit that
I am hurting because of it - setting
the world on fire versus setting my
heart on fire. Being vulnerable is just
a nicer way of saying, open yourself
up from the inside out, rip your
ribcage apart, and bleed.
I hurt because I am a survivor of
abuse. I hurt because I am putting
words to my agony. I hurt because,
for so long, I was just screaming out
loud without realizing that I could
be putting art and love out into the
world. I hurt because I was killing
myself every day, complying with
those who wanted me to be less
alive because my existence made
them uncomfortable. I hurtbecause
my heart beats within layers of
wounds and scars that I have since
painted over with the colors of my
truths.
My heart is in the center of a
flowerbed, its roots taking hold in
an undeniable aura that reminds
me that I am everythingI am meant
to be.
Being socialized to believe that
we are not worthy of love is painful.
Unlearning that shame and doubt
is excruciating. Excruciating, but
necessary, and part of what it means
to grow, heal, and find community.
Not the theories of "community"
that social justice classes or allyhood
trainings will have students try to
imitate, but the community that is
rooted in survival. The community
that embraces me after my armor
cracks and my fierceness wavers.
The community that jumps into
my car in the middle of the night
and blasts somber electronic music.
The community that replenishes
my spirit after it has been violently
drained and sucked out of me.
The community that affirms and
challenges me in ways that make
me believe I am actually worth
something. The community that
blooms and blossoms as we sit in
a circle to bask in one another's
beauty and strength while healing
through home cooked nourishment.
Whenwetakethe risk toopen our-
selves up and reach out, others will
reach back. They breathe, "You're
hurting. I have hurt, too. I am hurt-
ing, too." I am convinced that those
with pain - real deep, down-to-the-
core pain - also know what it truly

means to love and to love fiercely
As a queer person of color, my mere
existence is an act of rebellion. To
have the audacity to take ownership
of my body, my gender expression,
and whom I choose to love and share
my energy with is to declare war. To
demand to be treated the way I want
to be treated is to declare war against
a society that does not want me.
My community, my comrades in
war, is the difference between life
and death. This community can only
be found in our hearts, our fury, our
art, our words to each other, and our
love for one another.
Admittedly, the process of finding
community is not an easy journey. I
do not mean to suggest that, but the
alternative is not any easier.
On that journey, I have begun
to understand how to be loved and
how to love intentionally, among
many other lessons that I hold dear
to my soul - scrawled in a notebook,
memorialized in a Facebook status
or a tweet, and emblazoned into
the stars that make up my being. I
would not have learned these lessons
without the guidance and support
from so many other trailblazers who
shared their pain and love with me.
With everything I have learned, I
hope to empower my communities to
realize thatwe -no one else -are the
authorities of our own existence and
to embark on the journey of loving
ourselves despite all of the messages
that tell us otherwise. I practice
empowerment through compassion,
vulnerability, and the reclaiming and
construction of spaces.
By refocusing our energies
towards self-healing and radical
love, by cultivating and encouraging
the ability to articulate and make
sense of our experiences, we equip
ourselves with the arsenal necessary
to navigate this world.
We become agents of change that
make things happen. Whether that's
societal change or individual change,
it all makes a difference. We keep our
hearts soft and strong by loving one
another and being accountable to our
comrades, not the systems that seek
to destroy us.
Kim Katrin Crosby, during her
keynote speech at the 2013 Color of
Change Community Summit said,
"Ourmost radical workis to love our-
selves." These words made me realize
how far I had to fall just to get back
up. She changed my life because she
saw me. I now pass on that energy.
The words in this article are not
mine. They belong to those who have
selflessly reached out to me without
even realizing they were savingme in
the process.
I hope others, find community
within these lines.
I hurt. I hurt every single day. I
don't know if I'll ever stop hurting. I
know others are hurting too. I burn
so I can see you. I bleed so I can find
you. I love so we can heal.

PCAP focuses on
art of atonement

Exhibit to showcase
creative work from
the incarcerated
By COSMO PAPPAS
For the Daily
On Valentine's Day, the art
gallery at East Quad will open
an exhibition put on by the
Prison Cre-
ative Arts Hison
Project, or
PCAP as most Creative
call it, to the Arts Project
public. PCAP
was founded Lk
almost 25 Exhibition
years ago by Feb. 14-
English pro- March 14
fessor Buzz
Alexander. MondaytoFuiday,
PCAP "has loam-5pm
a lot of parts," EastQuad
said Vanessa
Mayesky, the Art Gallery
program's
Linkage and Portfolio Coordi-
nator. "But underneath all of
it is our belief in the power of
creativity."
While PCAP works primarily
with people who are currently
incarcerated through weekly
2-hour workshops with stu-
dent facilitators, the East Quad
exhibit will present art by par-
ticipants in PCAP's Linkage
Project.
Through this program, peo-
ple who have served time previ-
ously and participated in PCAP
during their incarceration have

the opportunity to advance and
exhibit their artistic endeavors
once they have been released or
are out on parole.
The theme of this year's
Linkage Exhibition is "Atone-
ment."
Shaka Senghor, the theme's
creator, is an associate of the
PCAP and a former participant
whose work as a writer and
speaker centers on redemption
and guilt with regard to crime
and, according to the biography
on his website, on the "hood
and not-so-glamorous side of
the streets."
Although not every piece
featured at this exhibit will
address the theme, the Atone-
ment Project is, at its root, an
attempt to rethink the process
of restorative justice and work
through Senghor's three-stage
model of atonement.
In Mayesky's words,
this process involves, first,
"acknowledgment that a wrong
was done," then "an apology
for one's actions" and, finally,
atonement.
This last stage centers on
the process of moving forward,
beyond the (self-)perception of
being a "potential threat" as an
ex-convict, and on proving to
oneself that convicted felons
are not excluded from being
"creative people ... artists,
musicians, actors or painters."
When volunteers actually
go to the facilities, they aim at
forging a creative, nonhierar-
chical "space that's welcoming
for everyone in it," Mayesky

said.
Mayesky, who encourages
students and faculty to vol-
unteer for PCAP, said that
"there are different ways to get
involved. If you're a student,
take one of our courses. It'll
change your life,; I'm being hon-
est."
There are courses available
with Alexander, the . English
professor, Janie Paul in the
Penny Stamps School of Art &
Design or Ashley Lucas and
Shaka Senghor in the School
of Music, Theater & Dance and
the Residential College.
Later in the semester, start-
ing March 19 and running
through Apr. 9, the 19th annual
Exhibition of Art by Michigan
Prisoners will open at the Dud-
erstadt Library on North Cam-
pus. Over 400 pieces by more
than 200 artists will be on dis-
play at the event.
"The idea, is that we're not
going in as teachers, not even
necessarily as experts," Mayes-
ky said. The essential part of
the program, for her, is that
"it (doesn't) matter where you
started as long as you just got
started."
The participants of PCAP,
along with their PCAP student
facilitators, come together as
artists in order to move beyond
one-dimensional caricatures
of prisoners as essentially
bad people who are incapa-
ble of creation and humanity.
Empowerment through artistic
creation is the rallying call of
PCAP.

on the record, Alex Petty-
fer is spending Valentine's Day
with his mother. The British
actor, who has starred in "Magic
Mike," "Beastly" and "I Am
Number 4" with a mix of lovely
leading ladies, has often been
featured in tabloids on the arm
of one or another. However, in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily about his new movie "End-
less Love," which comes out Feb.
14, Pettyfer admits that he has
always been a "hopeless roman-
tic."
"Endless Love" is a remake of
the 1981 classic starring Brooke
Shields, and follows a privileged
teenage girl (Gabriella Wilde,
"tarrie") as she falls recklessly in
lose s ith a "bad boy," to the con
steration ofher over-protective
father (Bruce Greenwood, "Star
Trek Into Darkness"). Petty-
fer believes that the remake is a
more modern take on the themes
of the original.
"I think because of the time
period that Brooke Shields made
that movie," Pettyfer said, "It
was very controversial, espe-
cially this subject matter on sex
and lust ... Whereas this is more
about two people in love that are
finding themselves."
Though he has had some
experience playing a romantic
lead, Pettyfer says finding chem-
istry with his partner always has
its challenges.
"It's very hit or miss with
doing a movie like this, because
sometimes when an actor hates
another actor, there can be
chemistry," Pettyfer said. "You
never know how it's gonna turn
out."
Luckily, lie said that wasn't
the case with this movie, hop-

Football is fleeting,

Compagnie Kafig
finds joy in dance

As I sink deeper into the
sands of time and come closer
to understanding the transient
entity that is our own mortality,
I realize that I just don't have
time for the
Super Bowl.
I've become
increasingly
less inclined
to attend

ed parties orE
even pretend
that I have HARWOOD
the slightest
awareness
of who's playing (something
about the two states that legal-
ized weed?). I can no longer be
coaxed with booze, commer-
cials with obscene budgets or
even the camaraderie provided
by friends and family to feign
emotional interest and give up
roughly three hours of my time
here on earth - I just don't care
about the Super Bowl.
This past Super Bowl, I was
obliged to perform my edito-
rial duties at 420 Maynard

this paper day in and day out. A
majority of the staff was enam-
ored with the inflated Ameri-
can tradition, keeping one eye
on their work - while the other
was glued to one of the three
screens in the office playing the
game. As halftime approached,
the argument of Bruno Mars's
worthiness to headline such a
coveted spot grew. As an arts
editor, I felt inclined to form an
opinion on the matter, but once
again, I just didn't care enough.
But as Bruno's performance
began, I started to find myself
feeling like the rest of the
newsroom, unable to look away
- with not one, but two eyes
latched on to the hovering TV.
Yes, Bruno made his descent
onto the-stadium whilst on a
levitating drum set. He also did
the splits while dancing and
didn't look like an asshole. The

What happens when you put 11
male dancers from Rio de Janeiro
under the direction of a French-
Algerian cho-

young age. Beginning with circus
performance and martial arts
training at age 7, Merzouki has a
thrillingmovementvocabulary. As
a teenager, he gravitated towards
the hip-hop trend in the streets
and in the early '90s started danc-
ing with, and choreographing for,
his friends.
Soon he began to create shows.
His first project was called "Kfig,"
a title that carries a meaning close
to "cage" inbothGerman and Ara-
bic. Merzouki is intrigued by the
concept of confinement and the
ways in which dance can tran-
scend the boundaries we create
and connect people. It became the
name and mission of the company:
"Compagnie Kfig."
For the first decade, the compa-
ny's dancers were mostly French
and of Algerian descent like Mer-
zouki. The group you will see
dancing at the Power Center this
Saturday, however, comes from an
entirely different part of the world.
Merzouki met 11 Brazilian
dancers touring with their com-
pany - Urbana de Danga - at
the Lyon Biennial dance festival
in 2006. He was so impressed by
their vibrant energy that Mer-
zouki wanted to get to know them
and their personal stories fromthe
favelas (Brazilian shanty towns). A
few years later, Merzouki created
the dance "Agwa" specifically for
the 11 dancers, and they became
part of the company.

The separate international and
cultural influences are seen clearly
within Merzouki's choreographic
devices. But the combinations of
these dance and movement tra-
ditions from around the world,
paired with core human themes,
create something beyond identi-
fication. Matching hip-hop cho-
reography with lyrical music, or
spontaneous street dance with
conceptual compositions, he asks
the audienceto reimagine.
"(Merzouki) really wants to
show that 11 Brazilian dancers

have a strongimpact wherever itis:
in Asia, in Australia - we've been
everywhere with this show really,"
Gillet said. "The message is really
positive everywhere. It shows that
hip-hop dance can be on stage
- it's not only in the streets. The'
physical aspect ...works with every

can be universal and it's here to

When Mac Bennett walked
into media availability Tuesday
afternoon, he
looked around
the room at the Michigan at

and made a
request. Matchup:
"Don't ask Minnesota
me about Penn 19-4-5;
State," the senior Michigan
14-7-3
defenseman said.

weekend, butT
it has had little BTN (Fri.),
time to dwell on
the loss. Instead,
the Wolverines
have been busy preparing for
their visit to Minneapolis for a
crucial two-game series against
No.2 Minnesota.
The Golden Gophers (8-2-
2 Big'Ten, 19-4-5 overall), one
of the nation's top teams, only

recently relinquished their
stranglehold on the conference.
Two losses at Wisconsin helped
keep Michigan within six
points of Minnesota, opening
up a three-team battle with the
Badgers for the two invaluable
byes in the Big Ten Tournament.
"We need to make sure we get
up for this game," Bennett said.
"They're going to be ready for us."
But as much as Bennett and
Michigan (6-3-1, 14-7-3) would
like to forget about Penn State,
Alex Guptill's body won't let
him. Though the forward skated
Wednesday after suffering an
upper-body injury against the
Nittany Lions, Michigan coach
Red Berenson confirmed that
the junior won't make the trip.
Berenson plans to replace
Guptillby moving junior forward
Phil Di Giuseppe to the top line
alongside freshman JT Compher
and senior Derek DeBlois.,
Guptill's scoring prowess
will be missed against the
Gophers, which rank second
nationally in team defense,
averaging 1.96 goals against.
Much of that is thanks to
netminder Adam Wilcox, who

is following a record-setting
freshman campaign with an
equally stellar sophomore one.
In 27 games this season, he
boasts a .930 save percentage
and three shutouts.
After surrendering seven
goals in two games to Penn
State, Michigan's defensive unit
will have its hands full with the
Gophers, which rank seventh in
the nation in scoring offense.
And focusing on neutralizing
only one forward won't shut
down the prolific attack. Seven
Minnesota players have found
twine at least eight times, led by
Seth Ambroz's 12 tallies.
"They're an explosive team,"
Berenson said. "All three of their
forward lines are about equal."
Both Minnesota and
Michigan, college hockey's
winningest programs, posted
disappointing results last
weekend, but a split or sweep
would put the Wolverines in a
good position for the remainder
of the Big Ten season.
And when the final horn
sounds Saturday night, it'll
mark the end of a series one
team won't want to forget.

the week-long break before the
Michigan State game will give
Beilein's squad its most rest
since December.
When the Wolverines last
played Wisconsin, their win in
the Kohl Center was their first
there this millennium, and the
Badgers were ranked No. 3 at the
time, perched atop the Big Ten.
Since then, the teams have
followed opposite trajectories.
Michigan has won five of
its last seven to stay at the
top of the conference, while
Wisconsin 'coach Bo Ryan's
team has sunk back into the
middle of the pack.
However, after losing five
of six games during a stretch
in January, the Badgers have
found their rhythm again. They
knocked off Michigan State last
week before bringing down
Minnesota Thursday night.
A win on Sunday would
mark Michigan's first sweep
of Wisconsin since 1999, and
it would set up a game the
following week that could very
well decide the Big Ten regular-
season champion.
For a coach who is surprised
by very little, that fact is enough
to bring wonder to Beilein.
"It's great to be in this,"
Beilein said. "I don't know if
we expected this this year just
because we're watching these
two kids (Trey Burke and Tim
Hardaway Jr.) play in the NBA
right now, and they're doing
really well. And I'm saying,
'Jeez, we better have made it to
the Final Four last year - those
were really two good players.'
"When you have that drop
off, we didn't know where it
was going to come from, and
especially our defense. Where
it hasn't been where it needs to
be, it's getting better. And then
we've got some kids that hae

Illinois State, and senior Lyndsay
Doyle matched that on her own.
In the circle, Hutchins
will rotate between Betsa,
Driesenga and junior left-
handed pitcher Haylie Wagner,
matching their strengths with
their opponent's weaknesses
and doling out innings to suit
the pitchers' needs.
"I tell my pitchers, 'You're on
the team. You need to be ready
to pitch,"' Hutchins said.
Michigan's other games will
come against Boston College,
a team it beat 14-2 last season,
and, for the first time in school
history, Central Arkansas.
But behind the Wolverines'
balance of veteran composure
and youthful energy, the
introduction is shaping up as
one that the Bears might want
to forget.

SOCH I 2014
Alumni in Sochi Underclassmen bring depth for

On Sunday, Michigan alumni
Meryl Davis and Charlie White
added another tally to the United
States' medal count at the Winter
Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
The two-time world champion
ice dancers brought home the
bronze medal in record-breaking'
fashion, making it the pair's
second Olympic medal.
The road to bronze started
Saturday, when the U.S. Figure
Skating team sat in seventh place,
about to miss the final cut. But
Davis and White's short dance
performance earned a score of
75.98, putting the United States
in the final five on Sunday. The
duo also beat defending Canadian
gold medalists and training
friends Tessa Virtue and Scott
Moir, who trailed by three points.
Davis and White jumped to
first on the scoreboard with their
best international mark, 114.34,
to earn the bronze medal with 60
total points. Russia claimed gold
(75), its first of the 2014 Games,
and Canada (65) settled for silver
despite the second-place finish for
Virtue and Moir.

Max Pacioretty, who played
for the Michigan hockey team
in 2007-08, showed no signs of
physical damage throughout the
entirety of his ice time Thursday.
He recorded an assist and ateam-
leading four shots in the United
States' 7-1 rout of Slovakia.
Outside of the American team,
Brian Lebler of Austria was
put to the test Thursday night,
playing on a line with two NHL
players - Michael Grabner of the
New York Islanders and Michael
Raffl of the Philadelphia Flyers.
Lebler, who played under
Michigan coach Red Berenson as
recently as the 2009-10 season,
recorded two assists and two
shots on goal in Austria's 8-4 loss
at the hands of Finland.
He and Team Austria will go
against defending gold medalist
Canada on Friday.

After an appearance in the
Women's College World Series
last season, it shouldn't come
as much of a surprise that
Michigan's softball team has
plenty of veteran leadership.
What is eye catching,

though, is how

underclassmen

season-opening
tournament at
South Florida.

filling gaps left by departed
seniors, either - they're
steppingup into important roles.
Left fielder Kelly Christner
pushed hard for playing time
in the preseason and was
ultimately rewarded by starting
the opener against Florida over
returning sophomore outfielder
Sierra Lawrence.
So when Michigan (3-1)
travels to Lafayette, La. for
a five-game invitational this
weekend, it will do so knowing it
has the depth and poise needed
to win games, regardless of
which players have experience.
"The game doesn't know if
you're a freshman or a senior,"
said Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins. "The game only
knows how you play it."
According to Hutchins and
Driesenga, the team is focusing
on playing elite softball.
The Wolverines will open
this weekend's tournament
against Memphis (1-3) on
Friday, a game in which they
will be heavily favored. The
Tigers have mustered just eight
runs in four games while giving
up 17, including nine in a mercy-
rule loss to Troy.
But after thatgame, Michigan
can expect a serious challenge
from No. 20 Louisiana-

Lafayette. The Wolverines
ousted the Ragin' Cajuns (2-2-
1) in last year's Super Regional,
but junior right-handed pitcher
Sara Driesenga insists there
won't be any bad blood - at
least from her dugout.
"I think it's a pretty clean
slate," Driesenga said, smirking.
"We did what we had to do."
According to Hutchins and
Driesenga, the team is focusing
less on what to expect from its
opponents this weekend and
more on playing the type of
softball it knows it can play.
The Wolverines scored seven
runs against Illinois State in
the first half of last Sunday's
doubleheader before crushing
Bethune-Cookman, 12-1, to end
their tournament.
Ramirez and Romero
combined for five hits against

after batting .583 and scoring
six runs in four games this
past weekend, and freshman
right-handed pitcher Megan
Betsa led the sixth-ranked
Wolverines in innings pitched
(10) and strikeouts (13) in her
first tournament. Another
underclassman, sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero, had
a grand slam and nine runs
batted in.

coach Kim MICHIGAN 68

Arico. This
time, Barnes Arico wasn't going
to let that happen.
And she didn't - in the first
half, at least.
Michigan's porous defense,
combined with a disappointing
start to the second half, led to
a 76-68 Wolverines loss to the
21st-ranked Cornhuskers - their
fifth loss in seven games.
Like in its last several games,
Michigan (6-6 Big Ten, 15-10
overall) was able to run with
its opponent during the first
20 minutes of play, but it was
the second half that caused the
problems.
"I think the first five or six
minutes (of the second half)
were a struggle, but I think we
adjusted," Barnes Arico said.
"They were able to get out in
transition, which is what they did
against us the first time at their
place, and they scored some easy
baskets so we got ourselves in a
bit of a hole."
Following the ugly start to the
half, the Wolverines were able
to make a run to close the gap to
as little as six with free throws
from freshman point guard Siera
Thompson, but it was too little,
too late for Michigan.
After allowing the

Cornhuskers (8-3, 18-5) to shoot
67 percent in the first half,
Michigan came out inthe second
aiming to improve its defense,
but the attempts never truly
came to fruition.
The Wolverines turned to
a man defense to try and slow
down Nebraska's offense, but
it didn't work, as it finished
the game shooting 59 percent
from the floor, including 18-for-
21 from the charity stripe.
And, like last time, two-time
first-team All Big Ten forward
Jordan Hooper dismantled the
Wolverines with 23 points and
nine rebounds. Hooper was
8-for-10 from the floor.
"She's a great player," said
junior forward Cyesha Goree. "It
was pretty tough guarding her,
but we did what we could."
Coming out of halftime,
Michigan turned the ball over
during its first possession. Two
possessions later, a backcourt
violation on junior guard
Shannon Smith turned the ball
back to the Cornhuskers again.
A three-point play from
Emily Cady on the subsequent
possession gave Nebraska a nine-
point lead - its biggest lead of
the game at that point. Though
Michigan cut it to six with
under a minute remaining, the
Wolverines didn't score a field
goal in the last 4:52 of the game,
relying on free throws to close
the deficit.
At the heart of Michigan's
struggles was, once again, its
defense. After spending the
first half of the season out-
hustling and outrebounding
their opponents, the Wolverines

are starting to look like a young,
inexperienced team.
In the first half, Michigan's
five offensive rebounds - four
from Goree - kept the team in
the game despite Nebraska's hot
shooting. But in the second half,
the Wolverines'contestedbaskets
were no longer falling, and even
though they were able to grab
three more offensive rebounds,
they were unable to convert the
second-chance opportunities.
"We hit some shots, but there
were so many shots we didn't hit,
and they'd hit those shots and
score," Goree said. "If we had
gotten more stops, it would've
been a totally differentball game."
Like the rest of the team, Goree
shined in the first half but went
quiet in the second. The junior
forward went into halftime with
12 points, six rebounds and four
assists. And while her hustle
remained present in the second
frame, her offense went cold.
Goree didn't hit a field goal
in the second half until 6:52
remained in the game, and by
then, the Wolverines were down
by 13. She ended the game with
20 points, 10 rebounds and a
career-high six assists. Smith
added 12 points and sixrebounds.
"Cyeshahas reallygrownleaps
and bounds, and you saw that
tonight," Barnes Arico said. "I
think our biggest challenge now
with a young lady like Cyesha
is, 'Hey you're doing a fabulous
job on the offensive end. You're
rebounding, you're scoring, but
now you have to contribute on the
defensive end.'
"That's reallyour challenge for
our team right now."

Despite the
significant deficit at the hands
of a ranked opponent which had
already handed it a drubbing
earlier this season, the Michigan
women's basketball team
scrapped, clawed and scraped
its way back. Scrums for loose
balls became the norm, and the
Wolverines sought out physical
contact on every opportunity.
But Michigan fell short
of pulling off the complete
comeback in the 76-68 loss.
The last time the teams
met, the Wolverines barely
made the Cornhuskers bat an
eye in an 84-51 loss in Lincoln

rarely missed,
shooting 26-for-44 in the game
and the Wolverines didn't help
their cause, sending Nebraska
five gifts in the form of turnovers
in the first eight minutes of the
half.But Michigan battled on.
Junior forward Cyesha Goree
seemed to spend more time
on the ground than she did
standing up. And when she was
standing, all she did was score,
gather rebounds and deftly dish
out assists when double teams
engulfed her. Her six assists
were a career high.
"We kind of had a chip on
our shoulders, so we came out
