In her second year of medical 

school 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan, 
Rahael 
Gupta 

contemplated taking her own 
life. While Gupta got the help she 
needed and returned to school 
the following year, she uncovered 
a stigma among the medical 
community 
in 
which 
many 

physicians — and those in training 
— hide their depression for fear 
of 
professional 
consequences. 

Now, in her final year of medical 
school, Gupta is speaking out 
about her struggles with mental 
health and emphasize that, just 
like the patients for which they 
care, doctors are not immune to 
depression.

In Gupta’s second year of 

medical 
school, 
she 
began 

feeling fatigued and upset as 
she fell behind in school work. A 
dedicated worker, Gupta wanted 
to just focus on her studies and 
tried to ignore her increasing 
inability to function in school. 
She never considered she was 
suffering from depression until a 
trusted medical school counselor, 
whom she had visited at the time 
to try to defer a test, suggested she 
might be depressed.

“She 
was 
the 
one 
that 

recognized, ‘Okay, this student 
isn’t just having a hard time, there 
is something wrong here,’” Gupta 
said. “She was the first person to 
ask me, ‘Rahael, do you think you 
could be depressed?’ No one had 
asked me that before.”

For Gupta, her mental health 

had become a secondary concern 
to exam deadlines and school 
work, but as a result, her academic 
performance and her well-being 

diminished.

“I was so low and distraught — 

I was just happy that somebody 
was asking me about how I 
was doing instead of about my 

performance,” she said.

Gupta 
is 
not 
alone 
in 

suffering 
from 
depression. 

A 2016 study conducted by a 
team at Brigham and Women’s 

Hospital and the U-M Medical 
School 
found 
one 
in 
four 

medical students may develop 
depression. Though the intensity 
of medical school would seem 
to be an environment naturally 
rife with anxiety and stress for 
students, study co-author Srijan 
Sen explains there is a taboo 
concerning doctors who appear to 
suffer from such pressures.

“I think there’s a culture that 

we’re supposed to be strong and 
nothing can faze a doctor, and 
they can handle anything and 
continue on,” Sen said.

The team collected data from 

over 200 studies, which examined 
the mental health of 129,000 
medical students in 47 countries. 
In 
addition, 
researchers 

found one in 10 students will 
contemplate 
suicide 
during 

medical school. Though there 
are disproportionate numbers of 
medical students suffering from 
depression and suicidal thoughts, 
results from the study show 
only 16 percent of those with 
depression are seeking help.

Sen has previously worked on 

other studies that examine the 
mental health of medical students 
and professionals. He visited 
study participants years after 
they graduated from medical 
school 
and 
completed 
their 

residences to observe similar rates 
of depression and reluctance to 
request mental health care later in 
the participants’ later career lives.

The 
Vietnamese 
Student 

Association painted the Rock 
— a University of Michigan 
tradition 
— 
with 
their 

names and the name of their 
organization on Thursday night 
. On Friday, VSA students found 
their organization’s name on the 
Rock defaced with lewd graffiti 
and expletives directed toward 
the police.

“We’re saying, we’re here, 

we’re here on this campus, and 
we’re here and we exist,” VSA 
co-president Khang Huynh, a 
Public Health senior, said. “So 

when someone vandalized it, it 
left a sour taste in our mouth. 
If you want me to blunt, it just 
felt like a middle finger to our 
student org. To have your name 
literally vandalized over.”

In a statement shared by 

the VSA on Facebook, which 
received over 300 shares as of 
Sunday night, the organization 
referred to the incident not just 
as vandalism, but as a “hate 
crime.”

“This incident is one of many 

vandalizations targeting people 
and 
student 
organizations 

of color at the University of 
Michigan,” the statement said.

Engineering sophomore Radu 

Tolontan and Education senior 
Nick Maternowski may come 
from different colleges at the 
University of Michigan, but they 
share appreciation of the School 
of Education’s new Education for 
Empowerment minor. 

“I don’t think it’s for LSA 

students, I don’t think it’s for 
Arts students, I don’t think it’s for 
Engineering students,” Tolontan 
said. “I think it’s a minor for 
pretty much anybody who likes 
working with people and bringing 
power to people.”

The 
15-credit 
Education 

for Empowerment minor was 
launched this fall and offers 
students the chance to critically 
examine the role of education in 
social change and justice.

Simona Goldin, director of 

instructional design at the School 
of Education, explained the minor 
was developed after faculty who 
taught the Schooling in Multi-
Culture Society course noted 
students’ continued desire to 
pursue questions of social justice 
and its impact on educational

Seller directed plays at the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre as a student at Michigan

Acclaimed Broadway producer 

Jeffrey Seller, a University of 
Michigan 1986 graduate, spoke 
to a packed auditorium at Palmer 
Commons 
Friday 
afternoon 

about his student experience at 

the University and his success in 
producing hit-Broadway shows like 
“Rent,” “Avenue Q” and “Hamilton.”

Seller graduated with a bachelor’s 

degree in political science and 
worked various jobs while at the 
University, including directing plays 
at the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre 
and writing for The Michigan Daily. 
Seller explained the difficulty he 

faced during his senior year, when 
he was unsure how to navigate his 
goals for the future.

After graduation, Seller moved 

to New York City to pursue a 
career in public relations within 
the entertainment industry. There, 
he met the people who became an 
integral part of his early career.

“Who we team up with helps 

determine our future,” Seller said. 
“The question will be, ‘What can you 
make with yourself and the people 
that you meet from Michigan, and 
the years right after?’”

institutions 
— 
regardless 
of 

whether they were pursuing a 
teaching career.

“Something that we noticed 

in that class (Schooling in a 
Multi-Cultural Society) is that 50 

percent of the students who take 
that class go on to be teachers, 
which is fantastic,” Goldin said. 
“The other 50 percent kept 
speaking in very similar ways; 
even though it was across 10 
years, even though they were not 
standing next to each other, they 
were saying very similar things. 
The things they were saying 

evoked a real hunger. What they 
were saying is, ‘I’m committed to 
social justice, I’m really deeply 
interested in the ways in which 
schools can be a force for justice 
in society.’”

The minor is made up of 

one 
foundation 
class, 
three 

electives, 
a 
field 
internship 

and a final capstone course. 

After completing the initial 
foundation course, students 
have the chance to select 
one of three pathways on 
which to focus: Children 
and 
Youth 
in 
Context: 

Culture, 
Communities 

and Education; Advancing 
Equity through Education 
Policy; and Education in a 
Global Context. There is 
also an option for students to 
create their own pathway.

Goldin said the goal of 

establishing 
pathways 
is 

to ensure students’ gained 
expertise in one particular 
area.

“The reason we have 

these discrete and coherent 
pathways is because we 
want student to have some 
depth and some mastery,” 
Goldin said. “It’s wonderful 
to take something here and 
take something there, but we 
wanted at the end for people 
to say, ‘In these 15 credits, I 
have learned how to do this, I 
have learned about that, and 
now I’m equipped to do this 
great work.’”

Goldin 
also 
reiterated 

Tolontan’s 
earlier 
sentiments 

about the applicability of the 
minor because it emphasizes 
pervasive issues like teaching 
and learning.

“If 
you 
live 
inside 
of 

this 
society, 
then 
thinking 

systematically about schools is 
critical,” Goldin said. “No matter 
what profession you’re going to 
be in, there are so many ways 
– by necessity –you’re going to 
have to think about teaching and 
learning.”

Maternowski added he felt 

the minor presents a way for 
students to explore the world of 
education without commitment.

“It brings the School of 

Education more into the rest of 
the University because often it’s 
like Engineering classes – you’re 
not going to take an engineering 
class if you’re in LSA – and I think 
for the longest time you weren’t 
going to take an education class if 
you were in LSA,” Maternowski 
said. “Now this is kind of like 
there’s a way to dabble in 
education without going through 
all sorts of loopholes.”

While many schools have 

already accepted the minor — the 
most recent being the School of 
Public Health — the College of 
Engineering has yet to follow.

Nevertheless, Tolontan has 

already started taking classes to 
fulfill its requirements. 

UNIVE R SIT Y SYMPHONY ORCHESTR A

While 
many 
University 

business students have come to 
rely heavily upon the schools 
Starbucks for their caffeine 
needs, an institute at the Ross 
School of Business has invested 
in a healthy, energy-boosting 
alternative.

On Tuesday, the Zell Lurie 

Institute 
at 
the 
Business 

School announced a $100,000 
investment from its Founders 
Fund 
into 
organic 
snack 

company SMPL.

The funds will used for 

expanded 
distribution 
and 

marketing efforts.

SMPL sells bite-sized organic 

protein bars in three flavors. 
The snacks incorporate organic 
fruits, 
nuts 
and 
superfoods 

in resealable bags tailored to 
on-the-go consumption. SMPL’s 
target market is busy, modern 
wellness consumers.

According to a press release, 

University alum Ellis Fried 
founded the company to replace 
the 
existing 
unhealthy 
or 

inconvenient energy bars.

“I founded SMPL out of my 

personal dissatisfaction with 
the energy bars on the market 
— they were either filled with 
sugar, didn’t deliver on taste, or I 
never wanted to finish the entire 
bar at once,” Fried said.

During 
his 
time 
at 
the 

University, 
Fried 
earned 

more than $17,000 in the 2017 
Michigan Business Challenge 
and won the Ross School of 
Business BBA Entrepreneur of 
the Year Award. 

Stewart Thornhill, executive 

Director of the Zell Lurie 
Institute, said in the press 
release Fried has shown strong 
potential as an entrepreneur 
since his undergraduate years.

“Ellis 
has 
shown 
great 

initiative and promise as an 
entrepreneur, and we’re proud 
to have supported him at every 
step of the journey. We’re 
committed to helping him on 
his mission to make healthy 
eating convenient, and we look 
forward to his future successes,” 
Thornhill said.

According to Michigan 
Medicine spokeswoman 
Mary Masson, the 
organization offered the 
nurses raises of at least 3 
percent. Masson also said 
the nurse-to-patient ratio is 
in the top 2 percent in the 
nation.

The budget for the project 
is $150 million and would 
encompass a space that is 
200,000 square feet. The 
funds will come from 
investment proceeds, gifts 
and the Student Life 
Student Fee for Facility 
Renewal. The proposed 
renovations come on the 
heels of a $13 million 
overhaul of the North 
Campus Recreation 
Building, recently reopened 
this year.

According to Zhang, a 
Kinesiology graduate 
student, individuals burn 
191 calories an hour while 
walking at a 
one-mile-per-hour pace, as 
opposed to 72 calories 
sitting.

In both the 2014 and 2010 
midterm elections, 
however, voter turnout in 
Michigan was above the 
national averages of 37.8 
and 36.3 percent, respec-
tively. Voter turnout rates 
for the 2018 primary rose 
from 2014 levels, however, 
indicating turnout may 
increase come November.

The University of Michigan 
Board of Regents 
announced a 3.5 percent 
increase in University 
President Mark Schlissel’s 
annual salary as part of the 
president’s yearly evalua-
tion. This is the president's 
fourth pay raise, and brings 
his pay from $820,000 to 
over $850,000...His 
starting salary upon hiring 
in 2014 was $750,000.

This announcement comes 
two weeks after the release of 
Office for Institutional Equity’s 
yearly Sexual Misconduct 
Report which reported an 
increase in sexual misconduct 
reports but a decrease in 
investigations launched by the 
University compared to 
previous data. According to 
the publication, reports went 
up from 218 to 277 while 
investigations went down 
from 28 the previous year to 
20.

Le: What constitutes a hate crime?

Many 
would 
agree 
no 

undergraduate 
experience 
at 

the University of Michigan is 
complete without painting the 
Rock. Last year, I painted the 
Rock for the first time as part of 
an annual event hosted by the 
Vietnamese Student Association. I 
got to meet a lot of new people and 
bond with them as we participated 
in a Wolverine tradition. I wasn’t 
able to make it to this year’s “Paint 
the Rock” event, however, and I 
soon learned of some unfortunate 
news: the freshly-painted Rock, 
which 
bore 
the 
Vietnamese 

Student Association abbreviation 
and 
the 
names 
of 
several 

members, had been defaced. The 
association posted the following 
on its Facebook page:

“On September 21, 2018, it 

came to our attention that our 
organization’s name was defaced 
on the Rock. We had painted 
‘VSA’ on all four sides of the 
Rock. We found that two sides 
were painted over with the words 
‘FUCK 12’ in yellow paint. On the 
most prominent side of the Rock, 
a painted penis defaced ‘VSA.’

This is vandalism, and this 

is a hate crime carried out by 
those with access to our campus. 
This incident is one of many 
vandalizations targeting people 
and student organizations of color 
at the University of Michigan.” 

The statement ended by calling 

VSA and allies to help repaint and 
“reclaim the Rock.”

Initially, I wasn’t sure what 

to think. I just sat in front of 
my computer, rereading VSA’s 
statement, wondering where I 
had heard this sort of rhetoric 
before.

And then it hit me.
Almost exactly a year ago, 

the Black Student Union issued 
anextremely similar statement in 
response to an incident involving 
racial slurs written on dorm room 
name tags:

“On Sept. 17, 2017, three Black 

University of Michigan students 
were 
targeted 
with 
racially 

derogatory language in the form 
of defaced name tags on their 
dorm doors. This is not only a 
crime of vandalism, but also a 
hate crime carried out by those 
with access to our campus and 
residence 
halls, 
presumably 

underclassmen students.” 

What was I to make of this? 

Did the Vietnamese Student 
Association 
knowingly 
copy 

the Black Student Association’s 
words? Or was there some 
protocol that required student 
organizations 
to 
issue 
their 

statements in a very particular 
way? I point this similarity out 
not to accuse Vietnamese Student 
Association of plagiarism, but to 
explain my confusion over the 
whole situation. 

I was also confused by how 

quickly the vandalization of the 
Rock had been labelled a hate 
crime. A hate crime is motivated 
by bias against certain groups of 
people, such as ethnic or racial 
minorities. 
Without 
knowing 

all the details, it’s difficult to 

determine whether the vandals 
specifically targeted VSA.

One might be tempted to 

draw comparisons to yet another 
incident of vandalization last 
year 
in 
which 
welcome 

messages written on the Rock by 
Assisting Latinos to Maximize 
Achievement had been defaced. 
However, one key difference is 
that the graffiti in the previous 
incident 
mentioned 
Latinos, 

whereas, in the case of the 
Vietnamese Student Association, 
there was no reference to the 
supposedly targeted group. It was 
reported “FUCK 12” had been 
painted on the Rock; considering 
that the number 12 is slang for 
“police,” it doesn’t make sense for 
the message to be directed toward 
the Vietnamese. Then again, 
vandals aren’t reasonable people 
in the first place, so maybe that’s 
a moot point.

I know I hold the unpopular 

opinion here, but I must speak my 
truth: I do not view this recent 
event as a hate crime. A crime? 
Perhaps. But a hate crime? No, not 
without more information.

Let me be clear — I’m not 

trying to invalidate anyone’s 
feelings. Vandalism is wrong, 
period. It’s a blatant show of 
disrespect. Anyone who is upset 
about this has every right to be; 
however, to call it a hate crime 
may be a bit presumptuous at this 
point. Someone covered the Rock 
in profanity. It had been painted 
by a student organization just a 
day before. That organization 
was composed of people of color. 
Maybe they were targeted, maybe 
they weren’t. I could imagine the 
same exact graffiti over anyone’s 
name, regardless of race.

Personally, I don’t feel as though 

my identity has been attacked. 
Further, if I were to call the 
incident a hate crime while there’s 
still so much unknown about it, I 
believe I would be undermining 
the experiences of those who 
have been victims of actual hate 
crimes, such as the Black students 
who had their name tags defaced 
or Assisting Latinos to Maximize 
Achievement.

The situation has me reflecting 

on my place among people of 
color. I think a big part of standing 
in solidarity with other people 
of color is recognizing their 
experiences are not necessarily 
my own. Though it’s unfortunate 
that someone painted over the 
Vietnamese Student Association’s 
name, I will not compare it to 
the racial slurs and worse that 
others on campus have endured. 
It’s my responsibility as an ally to 
understand some of the privileges 
that I have. The strength of my 
allyship isn’t based on the idea 
that I struggle in the same way 
that other people of color do, but 
on my ability to see our differences 
so that I may better understand 
and do what I can to help alleviate 
each person’s unique struggle. I 
will not exaggerate the setbacks 
that I face to validate my POC-
ness. I will not use narratives that 
do not belong to me.

Once more, I wasn’t there when 

the Rock was vandalized, and 
I don’t know who did it or why. 
The most I can do now is share 
my opinion, how I was (or wasn’t) 
affected as a member of the 
Vietnamese community. At the 
end of the day, I suppose what’s 
most important is that we get 
past it. While I don’t agree with 
all of the Vietnamese Student 
Association’s statement, at the 
very least, I’m glad that they were 
able to repaint the Rock.

of an email from American 
Culture 
Associate 
Professor 

John 
Cheney-Lippold 
denying 

a student’s request for a letter of

The email was met with outrage 
from various Zionist groups on

Cheney-Lippold’s refusal to write 
the letter of recommendation 
was 
anti-Semitic. 
Boycotting

Cheney-Lippold’s decision is not 
anti-Semitic because religion and

government and military are two 
separate things.

In response to the outcry on 

social media, Students Allied for 
Freedom and Equality released 
a statement Tuesday reaffirming 
SAFE 
“stands 
in 
solidarity 

with students, faculty, and staff 
boycotting Israeli universities” 
and emphasized the University 
was very quick to release its own 
statement to clarify the University 
does not approve of Cheney-
Lippold’s decision and University 
departments do not officially 
boycott.

Yet, as SAFE pointed out, the 

University has never released 
a 
statement 
condemning 
the 

blacklist that many students to 
which are subjected when they 
speak in solidarity with Palestine, 
despite attention to this issue being 
brought to the administration 
countless times. In the student’s 
words, Cheney-Lippold’s response 
to her request was “disturbing 
and unsettling,” but we think 

what’s disturbing and unsettling 
is the University’s failure to 
address 
and 
accommodate 

Palestinian students’ demands 
for years, yet its willingness to 
jump to defend this student and 
condemn a professor who was 
simply holding true to his beliefs 
and solidarity with Palestinian 
people. The stark contrast in 
responses, though unsurprising, 
is too evident to ignore. Though 
one may disagree with Cheney-
Lippold’s decision, one cannot say 
his email wasn’t courteous, honest 
and explanatory.

One thing we would like to 

commend 
is 
Cheney-Lippold’s 

willingness to use his identity as 
a white man, with no formal ties 
to the Palestine-Israel conflict, to 
stand in solidarity with the people 
in Palestine. One of the platforms 
taken by the student who received 
the denial of a recommendation 
letter is the fact that her “work 
habits, diligence, and aptitude as a 
student” should have been the sole 
determinants of the professor’s 
decision to write the letter, and 
that his refusal “allowed his 
personal beliefs to interfere with 
(her) dreams of studying abroad.” 
However, this goes deeper than 
a student’s innocent “dream” to 

study abroad. The country we are 
speaking of is a country with a 
history and present of oppressing, 
murdering, stealing land from 
and denying basic rights to 
Palestinian people. The purpose 
of boycott divestment sanctions is 
to cut any and all ties that would 
support Israel’s government and 
in turn aid in perpetuating the 
violation of Palestinian rights. It 
is negligent to pretend writing 
a recommendation letter for a 
student to study there is completely 
independent and uncorrelated to 
the political climate and taking a 
stance for justice.

It is important for those 

who 
hold 
privilege 
to 
levy 

their position to help the most 
vulnerable in society. That is 
what allyhood looks like. Cheney-
Lippold could have easily refused 
the student’s request for a letter 
of 
recommendation 
and 
not 

provided any answer or provided 
a different one. Rather, Cheney-
Lippold chose to provide the 
student with an honest answer 
that sparks dialogue and causes 
the student to reflect on her 
decision to study abroad at an 
institution that perpetuates the 
oppression of a group of people. 
Furthermore, Cheney-Lippold put 
his reputation at the University 
at stake by making this decision 
and participating in the academic 
boycott.

We hope the University will 

uphold 
their 
commitment 
to 

free speech — which they have 
no problem doing when highly 
problematic and harmful speakers 
like Richard Spencer ask to express 
their dangerous views — and 
will not punish Cheney-Lippold 
or any other faculty members 
who choose to participate in 
the academic boycott of the 
government of Israel.

Standing with Prof. Cheney-Lippold

American Culture professor 

John 
Cheney-Lippold 
of 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
has 

been receiving backlash from 
students, community members 
and administrators alike, with 
University Regent Denise Ilitch 
(D) going so far as to accuse 
the professor of anti-Semitism. 
These attacks come after Cheney-
Lippold, in adherence of the call 
made by Palestinian civil society 
organizations to boycott Israeli 
academic and cultural institutions, 
chose to rescind his agreement to 
write a letter of recommendation 
to LSA junior Abigail Ingber upon 
learning it would be for a study 
abroad program in Israel.

While it is unsurprising the 

University has been swift to 
criticize Cheney-Lippold for his 
decision, the University’s reaction 
to the incident demonstrates its 
ongoing complicity with and 
support for the violent Zionist 
settler colonial project. While 
masking itself in the language of 
political neutrality, the University 
willfully ignores the role of Israeli 
institutions in maintaining and 
expanding the military occupation 
of the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank, and its settler occupation 
of historic Palestine, as well as the 
impact this has on the academic 
freedom of Palestinians.

Curtis Marez, president of the 

American Studies Association, 
notes 
Israeli 
universities 
are 

targeted by this boycott “because 
they 
work 
closely 
with 
the 

government 
and 
military 
in 

developing weapons and other 
technology that are used to 
enforce 
the 
occupation 
and 

colonization of Palestinian land, 
while 
university-associated 

think tanks develop political and 
communications 
strategies 
to 

advance government aims and 
defend them internationally.”

Furthermore, 
Marez 
notes, 

“The Israeli occupation prevents 
Palestinian 
academics 
from 

accessing outside institutions of 
higher learning and professional 
conferences, 
hampering 
their 

ability to do their work, while 
Israeli authorities make it difficult 
for foreign academics to travel 
to Gaza and the West Bank.” In 
other words, Israeli academic 
institutions are not politically 
neutral when it comes to the 

violence of the Zionist nation-
state but are a key apparatus of the 
colonial project. The University 
must consider its students and the 
broader public as naïve to believe 
its propagation of study abroad 
programs in Israel is politically 
neutral and not, in fact, a validation 
of the role of these institutions in 
the Zionist settler project. It is not 
difficult to see the role that the 
Zionist nation-state and Israeli 
academic institutions play in 
limiting the academic freedom of 
Palestinians and those supportive 
of Palestinian liberation.

This is the same University that 

swiftly refused the Central Student 
Government’s 
call 
to 
merely 

form a committee to investigate 
companies in which the University 
invests donor and student monies 
for 
potential 
relationships 

to 
Palestinian 
human 
rights 

violations, 
undermining 
both 

on-campus student governance 
and Palestinian human rights. 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald’s 
statement 
that 

“financial factors such as risk 
and return” are the sole focus 
of the University’s investments 
demonstrates 
the 
University’s 

willingness to put profit over 
morality and Palestinian life. In 
a statement, University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
argues 
the 

previous two divestment instances 
in the University’s history — 
divestment from tobacco and 
from South African corporations 
under apartheid — were unique 
in that they “were inextricably 
linked to immoral and unethical 
actions and ideologies.” This 
grossly undermines the tangible, 
material and ongoing violence of 
Zionist colonialism, occupation, 
apartheid 
and 
displacement 

while clearly demonstrating the 
University’s — or at the very least, 
though no less consequentially, 
Schlissel’s — political position 
that the historic and ongoing 
violence and displacement of 
Palestinians and the theft of their 
land is something the University 
finds excusable and justifiable. 
The University frequently has 
betrayed its support of the violent 
political project of Zionism while 
criticizing its students, staff and 
faculty for challenging oppression 
with actions in accordance to their 
“personal views and politics.” 
The criticisms of John Cheney-
Lippold’s actions are not only 
a recent manifestation of the 
University’s complicity with this 

project, but further reflect the 
de facto political position of the 
University the supports and (given 
its 
investments) 
profits 
from 

Zionist violence and colonialism.

For all its shallow rhetorical 

concern with academic freedom, 
the University chooses to ignore 
the fact that ongoing colonialism, 
displacement, military occupation 
and apartheid policies propagated 
by 
the 
Zionist 
nation-state 

materially 
impact 
the 
ability 

of Palestinians to access such 
educational 
opportunities. 

Military checkpoints and armed 
Israeli Defense Force personnel 
disrupt Palestinians of all ages in 
their pursuit of academic success, 
often 
prohibitively 
and 
even 

lethally. According to the Institute 
for Middle East Understanding, 
a stark 50 percent of children in 
Gaza report a fear of attending 
school. During the first intifada, 
the Israeli army closed Palestinian 
universities for months. In its 2014 
offensive, Israel attacked three of 
Gaza’s seven universities, as well as 
seven United Nations schools and 
about 141 local schools. Displaced 
Palestinians 
face 
prohibitive 

restrictions which often prevent 
them from being able to return to 
Palestine, much less study there. 
Where is the University’s outrage 
for their right to education?

The University of Michigan 

already holds a de facto political 
stance supporting the violence of 
Zionist colonialism and military 
occupation. It cannot continue 
to pretend it is politically neutral 
and believe the public will be 
fooled about its political priorities 
and commitments. It’s time that 
the University not only confront 
and rectify its complicity in and 
support of such violence, but also 
take an active stand in supporting 
and working toward justice and 
liberation for the Palestinian 
people. Rather than attacking its 
own faculty for participating in 
the academic boycott of Israeli 
institutions, 
the 
University 

should acknowledge the merit 
of 
the 
boycott, 
participate 

in it and advocate for it. The 
University’s insistence that it 
is not a political institution is, 
at best, denial and, at worst, 
deception and manipulation. It’s 
time the University abandon its 
empty rhetoric and demonstrate 
a commitment to justice by 
supporting 
liberation 
for 

Palestinians.

SAFE: In solidarity with boycotters

The 
state 
of 
Israel 

actively 
engages 
in 
human 

rights 
violations 
upon 
the 

Palestinian 
people. 
From 

daily home demolitions 
to the 

imprisonment of thousands of 
innocent civilians 
to the illegal 

construction of settlements 
on 

Palestinian land, there is no 
question of the violence and 
inequity perpetuated by settler-
colonial Israeli apartheid.

We 
support 
and 
affirm 

Professor 
John 
Cheney-

Lippold’s 
right 
to 
boycott 

Israel. His actions are the same 
demanded by Palestinian civil 
society, and serve to recognize 
and resist forces committing 
human rights violations. To 
punish 
Professor 
Cheney-

Lippold for his actions would 
curtail 
his 
own 
academic 

agency.

We also want to underscore 

the 
double 
standard 
of 

“consequences” 
faced 
by 

students 
who 
support 
the 

state of Israel. This student, 
for whatever inconveniences 
she may face in securing a 
recommendation 
letter, 
will 

undoubtedly be able to visit, 
study, and work in the country. 
We 
remind 
the 
campus 

community 
that 
Palestinian 

students 
and 
their 
allies 

continue 
to 
be 
blacklisted, 

targeted, 
and 
exiled 
from 

their home country for their 
identities 
. Palestinian students 

do not have the privilege 
of going back to Palestine, 
much less studying abroad. 
Where is the concern for their 
educational opportunities?

Finally, SAFE would like to 

question the speed and force 
with 
which 
the 
University 

administration 
and 
campus 

community 
condemned 

Professor 
Cheney-Lippold. 

For years, students at the 
University of Michigan have 
been 
consistently 
targeted 

on 
international 
political 

blacklists for standing up for 

Palestinian human rights. We 
have brought the blacklist to the 
attention of our administrators 
repeatedly. There has been no 
University statement on the 
matter. This blacklist is just one 
of several tangible barriers for 
students that will prevent them 
from engaging in not just study 
abroad programs, but academic 
programs, jobs, and admittance 
into Palestine/Israel.

It seems as though, the 

administration and community 
are 
more 
interested 
in 

punishing 
a 
professor 
for 

exercising his right to express 
political views —views that may 
offend a powerful community 
on campus—than protecting 
the physical and emotional 
safety of Palestinian students.

SAFE vows to keep elevating 

the voices of Palestinians on 
this campus and around the 
world, and to stand with those 
already doing so in meaningful 
ways.

I

n 
2009, 
Marc 
Webb’s 
directorial debut “(500) Days 
of Summer” was released to 
high acclaim. The film, told in a 
non-linear arc, guides us through 
the eyes of Tom Hansen, played 
by 
Joseph 
Gordon-Levitt, 
a 
hopeless romantic who becomes 
infatuated with Summer Finn, 
portrayed by Zooey Deschanel. 
When the film was released, it 
received high praise from both 
critics 
and 
audiences, 
with 
famed critic Roger Ebert giving it 
a flawless review and applauding 
it as “a delightful comedy, alive 
with invention.”
In the intervening years, the 
movie has undergone several 
autopsies. The current zeitgeist 
has made great strides toward 
creating 
films 
that 
depict 
characters, specifically those in 
marginalized roles, with more 
attentiveness to fleshing out their 
identity and not succumbing to 
pernicious stereotypes. With 
such motions toward fairness 
in representation, we can easily 
reexamine films that may have 
put women, people of color 
and members of the LGBTQ 
community squarely in roles 
that denigrate their identities. 
Triangulating 
off 
of 
these 
specific groups, “(500) Days of 
Summer” is a deeply negligent 
and grossly misogynistic take 
on modern romance, one that 
obfuscates such a fact with its 
quirky and hipster aesthetic.
From the onset, we barely 
know anything about the titular 
character except what Hansen 
leads 
us 
to 
believe. 
We’re 
made aware of her parent’s 
divorce, which is used as a 
proxy to spurn her antipathy 
toward relationships. Yet that 
background 
information 
is 
essentially harnessed as a plot 
device for Hansen to grow from 
rather than as actual insight 
into her as a person. Finn fits 
perfectly into the mold of 
manic pixie dream girl, except 
that her disposition is so static 
(no thanks to the way Hansen 
myopically conveys her) that 
it would be more appropriate 
to just call her a “chill pixie 
dream girl.” In essence, she is a 
smattering of tropes that neatly 
plays into the fantasy of an 
emotionally immature, Smith-
loving 
involuntary 
celibate, 
which is virtually Hansen’s 
character.
Finn 
rejects 
Hansen 
as 
more than a hookup multiple 
times from the beginning of the 
movie, explaining, “this is fun” 
more than once. Each time this 
happens, he goes into violent 
tirades to his equally sexist 
friends, who homophobically 

conjecture 
the 
reason 
she 
doesn’t want a relationship is 
because she is a lesbian. Yet, we 
are expected to sympathize with 
his sensitive nature (I mean, 
he works at a greeting card 
company, right?), even though 
he uses his sensitivity as a guise 
for the toxic way he tries to 
gaslight Finn.
It would be easier to make 
a less critical reevaluation of 
such a movie if, while watching 
it, we viewed Finn as the 
protagonist and Hansen as the 
antagonist. Even Gordon-Levitt, 
an outspoken feminist, has made 
attempts to do so. Still, co-writer 
Scott 
Neustadter 
admitted 
the film was based off a prior 
relationship, 
rendering 
the 
plot even more masturbatory. 
And regrettably, the director 
peddled the idea that Finn was a 
stock character by categorizing 
her as “the one” at the time of its 
release.

Yet to disregard this film as 
an abysmal piece of anti-feminist 
garbage (which it arguably still 
is), would be remiss in taking 
the inadvertent lessons it has 
presented.
From a representational point 
of view, the film’s characters 
are all white, with people of 
color being very much at its 
margins (and, at certain points, 
mocked). 
Its 
overwhelming 
whiteness is a potent reminder 
of the work filmmakers must 
put into creating a diverse 
cast. Furthermore, the lack 
of sensitivity toward Finn’s 
character may have been fixed 
with a female director at the 
helm of the movie. Yet in 2009, 
women only accounted for 7 
percent of directors for the 
top 250 grossing films of that 
year. In 2017, they still only 
comprise 11 percent of directors, 
exhibiting the meager attempts 
made by Hollywood to put 
women in the director’s chair. 
However, when there is at least 
one female director or writer, 
almost half of all major roles in 
a film are women, an important 
insight 
into 
how 
women 
directors improve the overall 
representation of a film.

On a thematic level, “(500) 
Days of Summer” also allows 
the viewer to consider how our 
own expectations can cloud 
judgement much like it does 
for Hansen. We’re all guilty of 
falling for people, and equally so 
for those who don’t love us back. 
But this film demonstrates the 
way expectation can seep into 
reality and ultimately damage 
ourselves. Hansen is constantly 
projecting his ideal girlfriend 
onto Finn, preventing us from 
seeing her as a human being. 
Though pushed to extremes, 
loving someone as an abstraction 
rather than a person is a common 
consequence of infatuation and 
crushes.
In the penultimate moments 
of the film, Hansen goes to a 
rooftop party that Finn invites 
him to as a gesture of friendship. 
The scene parses the screen 
into 
two 
halves, 
with 
one 
presenting “Expectation” and 
the other presenting “Reality.” 
In “Expectation,” the party 
ends with Hansen and Finn 
hooking up again. In “Reality,” 
Finn reveals to her friends at 
the party that she is engaged, 
incensing Hansen and yielding a 
bout of depression.
We all have expectations 
about love and people. Whether 
it’s because we’ve been taught 
to view people as objects of 
affection by movies like “(500) 
Days of Summer” and the litany 
of other problematic romantic 
comedies, or because we get 
trapped in our own thoughts, 
it isn’t a crime to sometimes 
allow expectation to supersede 
reality. But we must learn to 
distill the two, especially when 
it comes to people we like. 
Viewing someone as a whole 
and not an idea grants them 
more humanity and us more 
understanding 
when 
things 
don’t end up working out. We 
can go onto future relationships 
with more healthy attitudes 
and hopefully attempt to better 
understand the other person 
involved. In this sense, “(500) 
Days of Summer” is its most 
successful when we see Hansen 
as the one who brought about 
his own tumbling spiral, and not 
Finn.
As 
romantic 
comedies 
become increasingly self-aware, 
we can use the ones we now see 
as antiquated to understand 
how to make better films, 
have more representation and 
work on cultivating healthy 
relationships.

MARGOT LIBERTINI | COLUMN

1991 v 2018
T

he 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
has 
decided 
to delay the vote on Brett 
Kavanaugh’s 
Supreme 
Court 
nomination in order to receive 
testimony from his accuser, Christine 
Blasey Ford, and Kavanaugh himself, 
in regard to recent sexual assault 
allegations against the Supreme Court 
nominee. This decision comes after 
Ford requested an FBI investigation 
occur before she testified, though 
it appears that will not be the case. 
Further, she and her lawyers have 
complained about the fact that 
the hearing will only involve two 
witnesses: Kavanaugh and Ford 
herself, as they fear it may turn into a 
“he said, she said” scenario.
Ford accused Kavanaugh of 
attempted rape when he was 17 and 
she was 15. Ford originally revealed 
this information in July in a letter to 
her Rep. Anna G. Eshoo, D-Calif., and 
later to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the 
ranking Democrat of the Judiciary 
Committee. Ford requested the story 
stay confidential. Thus, Feinstein 
refused to share the contents of the 
letter with the rest of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee until last week, 
when the story went public.
It is not clear this was the best 
decision, though — there are many 
paths Feinstein could have taken 
to treat the allegations with proper 
urgency 
and 
seriousness 
while 
simultaneously 
keeping 
Ford’s 
identity confidential. Allowing a letter 
consisting of such heinous accusations 
against a potential Supreme Court 
nominee to sit on her desk for six 
weeks was irresponsible on her behalf. 
It merely delayed the firestorm that 
was bound to come, and ironically, 
it left both Feinstein and Ford with 
less agency over the situation than if 
the senator had taken control of the 

situation from the beginning.
Whether 
she 
would 
have 
confidentially shared the story with 
the Judiciary Committee, gone to 
the FBI sooner or even shared the 
essence of the story publicly, there 
could have been precautions taken 
to protect Ford’s identity. Rather, 
the media obtained the story and 
everything else had to fall into place 
within a few days.
This is not the first time the 
highest-ranking Democrat on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee hasn’t 
been responsible about handling 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations 
against a Supreme Court nominee — 
history is eerily cyclical. I’m referring, 
of course, to the 1991 Clarence 
Thomas 
confirmation, 
during 
which Anita Hill testified Thomas 
had sexually harassed her. Former 
Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., infamously 
blocked three other women from 
testifying in order to quickly move 
the 
proceedings 
forward. 
The 
Democrats, the majority party in the 
Senate at the time, were accused of 
rushing the process along and not 
treating the allegations with proper 
reverence. Thomas now sits on the 
Supreme Court.
The Democrats cannot be the 
political party of 1991 in 2018. They 
should be as vigilant as possible in 
opposing Kavanaugh’s nomination 
in light of these allegations. It was 
suggested in The New Yorker that 
Feinstein did not come forward with 
Ford’s allegations sooner because she 
“acted out of a sense that Democrats 
would be better off focussing on legal, 
rather than personal, issues in their 
questioning of Kavanaugh.” However, 
that 
sentiment 
is 
misguided. 
Attempted rape is a criminal act, and 
placing a criminal on the Supreme 
Court 
has 
implications 
beyond 

“personal issues.” Though separating 
personal and political may have 
once been the norm, the #MeToo 
era managed to break through that 
barrier. Additionally, Democrats risk 
succumbing to Republican pressure 
to rush the process: a parallel to 1991.
Less than a year ago, Democrats 
pushed Al Franken out of Congress 
after 
various 
credible 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations 
against 
him surfaced. This modern record 
of holding abusers accountable 
for their actions buffers them 
from appearing disingenuous in 
fighting Kavanaugh’s nomination. 
Rather than appearing politically 
motivated, Democrats only face the 
risk of backing down and once again 
coming off as spineless and without 
any clear conviction.
Dianne 
Feinstein 
won 
her 
Senate seat in 1992, which was 
deemed the “Year of the Woman” 
because a record number of women 
were elected to Congress after 
outrage over the treatment of Hill. 
There were no women on the Senate 
Judiciary Committee to stand in 
solidarity with Hill in 1991.
27 years later and there are four 
women serving on the committee 
(all of whom are Democrats) — I 
hope this means Ford will have 
voices of solidarity, and not that four 
women sit there to maintain the 
status quo of an institutionalized 
boy’s club. I hope she will not be 
deprecated as Hill was, and I hope a 
sexual predator will not be making 
decisions with massive implications 
for sexual assault on campus, birth 
control and abortion access and the 
right to women’s bodily autonomy.

What we can learn from “(500) Days of Summer”

In 
response 
to 
these 
zoning 
changes 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
winter 
rush, a few fraternities have 
decided to disaffiliate from 
the Interfraternity Council 
and form the Ann Arbor 
Interfraternity 
Council. 
With disaffiliation, these 
fraternities 
lose 
the 
oversight, 
regulations 
and processes provided to 
IFC 
member 
fraternities 
associated 
with 
the 
University. In light of this 
new, independent fraternity 
organization, The Michigan 
Daily Editorial Board is 
concerned and curious as to 
how it affects the campus. 
We have rarely thought that 
IFC has gone far enough 
to protect student safety, 
but we are concerned about 
how these fraternities will 
act without any University 
oversight.
IFC 
protections 
include 
an 
alcohol-free 
rush 
environment, 
no 
hard 
liquor 
at 
parties, 
significant hazing oversight 
and a connection to the 
University’s 
investigative 
and 
disciplinary 
system. 
While 
students 
in 
disaffiliated 
fraternities 
will 
still 
be 
subject 
to 
University 
discipline 
should misconduct occur, 
the 
educational 
and 
reporting 
mechanisms 
that IFC provides to Greek 

life will not be available 
without affirmative action 
from the A AIFC. We worry 
without 
these 
University 
connections 
disaffiliated 
fraternities will not educate 
their members and provide 
reporting 
mechanisms 
to 
prevent hazing and other 
offenses. 
In 
addition, 
there has been little to no 
information on what the 

newly formed organization 
plans to do. The decision 
to 
disaffiliate 
seems 
to 
hinge on the need to avoid 
the effects of new zoning 
laws 
and 
in 
particular 
on 
the 
threat 
of 
losing 
the fraternity or sorority 
house. 
But 
that 
brings 
into 
question 
why 
these 
fraternities predicted they 
would lose affiliation in the 
first place.
Students should demand 
the 
A AIFC 
provide 

transparent standards at or 
exceeding the protection 
levels of the Universit y’s 
IFC 
before 
engag ing 
in 
any 
social 
events 
with 
these fraternities. While 
we have been critics in 
the 
past 
of 
the 
IFC’s 
lack 
of 
transparency 
in 
light 
of 
their 
self-
suspension 
last 
year, 
we worr y an institution 
with 
no 
obligation 
to 
provide transparency will 
not provide insight into 
how they seek to protect 
students until it is too 
late. We hope the A AIFC 
will alleviate these fears 
by being forthright with 
both current rushes and 
the public about how it 
plans 
to 
prevent 
sexual 
misconduct, 
hazing 
and 
other 
misconduct 
in 
an 
environment known for its 
desire for secrecy and self-
preser vation.

W

hile University of Michigan students were enjoying their summer, 
the Ann Arbor City Council approved changes to the zoning code for 
fraternities and sororities in the hopes they would improve relations 
between Greek life houses and neighboring Ann Arbor residents. One of the changes 
requires new fraternities and sororities to maintain affiliation with the University 
or another college to be allowed expansion in the city; if affiliation is lost, a fraternity 
or sorority can apply for a two-year exemption to prevent loss of residence.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

Release Date: Monday, September 24, 2018

As a followup to the wild 

success of the award-winning 
TV show “This Is Us,” creator 
Dan 
Fogelman 
(“Crazy, 

Stupid, 
Love”) 
returns 
to 

the big-screen with the star-
studded film “Life Itself.” 
But, Fogelman is experiencing 
a 
burnout. 
“Life 
Itself” 

follows Will (Oscar Isaac, 
“Annihilation”) as he recovers 
from the end of his marriage 
with his college sweetheart 
Abby (Olivia Wilde, “Drinking 
Buddies”). Through therapy 
sessions 
with 
Dr. 
Morris 

(Annette 
Bening, 
“20th 

Century 
Women”), 
Will 

explores the key moments in 
his and Abby’s lives that led 
up to their separation.

Although the monologues 

have the same rhythm of the 
emotional speeches of “This Is 
Us,” a show that redefined the 
quality of network dramas, 

“Life Itself” is too muddled. 
While the multiple timelines 
on “This Is Us” play out 
coherently and impactfully, in 
the limited space of a film only 
confusion results. Fogelman 
also indulges in grotesque, 
sadistic violence, forcing his 
characters to undergo every 
possible avenue of trauma 
with no empathy toward their 
suffering, only an obsessive 
fascination 
with 
torturing 

fictional people. In a teenage-
rage response to the gooey 
sentimentality of “This Is Us,” 
Fogelman packs “Life Itself” 
with every R-rated sequence 
of trauma, from molestation to 
decapitation. 

Every 
actor 
tries 
to 

showcase their chops, but 
the 
terrible 
script 
creates 

unbreakable 
barriers. 

Fogelman, 
in 
a 
show 
of 

pretentious douchery, inserts 
a meta excuse for the haggard 
narrative: 
Abby’s 
college 

thesis that explores unreliable 
narrators, 
challenging 
the 

way stories work. Fogelman, 
in all his ego, believes he 
has imagined a new format 
for stories, one that all the 
writers before him could not 
fathom. But, in reality, he has 
created the scribbled mess of a 
kindergartener learning their 

ABCs. Hold up, I’m sorry — 
that’s the first half of the film. 
Halfway through, Fogelman 

switches 
the 
narrative 
to 

a family in Spain with a 
complete tonal 180° and little 

preparation or 
explanation 
for the move.

The 
story 

refocuses 
on 

olive 
farmer 

Mr. 
Saccione 

(Antonio 
Banderas, “The 
Expendables 
3”) in Spain as 
he navigates a 
love 
triangle 

with the wife 
of his foreman. 
Although still 
interested 
in 

trauma, 
the 

second 
half 

feels like honey 
compared 
to 

the first. But 
the 
storyline 

fades due to 
the distracting 
question: Why 
does it exist 
in 
the 
same 

film? 
Rather 

than lean into 
the success of 
“This Is Us,” 
Fogelman tries 
too 
hard 
to 

prove he could 
do 
something 

different. 
Fogelman 
wants 
the 

parts of “Life 
Itself” 
to 
fit 

together 
like 

a complicated 
knot. Instead, 
he 
shows 

that 
there’s 

a 
difference 

between 
an 
expert 

constructing 
a 
beautiful 

puzzle and an 
amatuer trying 
to undo a knot 
only to make a 
bigger mess.

Prince 
has 
long 
been 

regarded as one of the most 
talented musicians the popular 

music world has ever seen; a 
multi-instrumentalist, he had 
the ability to independently 
churn out hits throughout his 
illustrious 
career, 
striking 

the perfect balance between 
complexity and simplicity. Yet, 
because of his mysterious aura, 
few knew his music making 
process, and even fewer actually 
witnessed it. Finally, with the 
posthumous release of Piano & 
A Microphone 1983, a live album 
that captured Prince sketching 
out song ideas on a piano, fans 
have a window into the Purple 
One’s creative process at the 
height of his career in 1983.

The album’s title is self-

explanatory; the only elements 
featured 
are 
a 
piano 
and 

Prince’s striking voice. With 

such stripped down production, 
the project lures you into 
the basement in which the 
35-minute project was recorded. 
When Prince asks his sound 
engineer to turn his mic down 
in the middle of the first track, 
an “OMG that’s him” reaction 
ensues, and visions of the artist 
stomping to a beat or wincing at 
the beauty of his own falsetto 
populate the mind.

The album’s live and private 

nature 
provides 
extremely 

special insight into how Prince 
worked. On “17,” you can hear 
him 
spontaneously 
voice 
a 

synth rhythm to accompany 
the melody he has already 
tracked out. On “International 
Lover,” Prince begins to beat-
box the drum beat he saw fit 
for the completed version of 
the song. Across the album, 
improvised 
vocal 
riffs 
and 

piano licks provide a refreshing 
twist on Prince’s music that is 
typically only heard polished 
and produced. These elements 
also highlight Prince’s musical 
prowess 
from 
a 
technical 

standpoint that many might not 
be aware of.

However, Piano has one major 

issue: Prince didn’t want you to 
hear it. Historically a pioneer 
for proper compensation for 
musicians, from his dispute 
with 
Warner 
Bros. 
to 
his 

outspoken 
disapproval 
of 

streaming services, he removed 
his entire discography from all 
streaming services when the 
platform became fans’ primary 
mode of consumption. His work 
wasn’t made available on these 
services until after his death, 
posing the controversy between 
the desire to to enjoy his art and 
the obligation to respect his 
wishes.

What’s worse, this album was 

never even intended for release 
on 
traditional 
consumption 

platforms, let alone streaming 
services. It was a secret project 
that sat comfortably in hiding 
until Prince’s archival music 
vault was literally drilled open 
and a deal was struck between 
the artist’s estate and Sony to 
release the vault’s exclusive 
content for profit.

So, if you’re a big Prince fan, 

it’s tough to enjoy Piano without 
the little voice inside your head 
screaming “traitor!” With that 
said, the project is ironically 
most geared towards Prince’s 
admirers who could appreciate 
the value of its look behind 
the scenes. How do you deal 
with such an ethical dilemma, 
with an angel perched on one 
shoulder and the devil on the 
other? My advice: Consume 
with caution and hope Prince’s 
improvisational scatting dilutes 
the heavy guilt that sits in your 
stomach.

MUSIC REVIEW

Sometimes it seems like moms 

are invincible. They find the 
thing we swear we lost forever 
ago. They can tell when we’re 
feeling down, and know exactly 
how to bring us back up. They 
predict when it’s going to be cold, 
even before the weather itself 

does, so that we always have a 
jacket when we need it. Moms 
can seem like superheroes: strong 
women that push through their 
days selflessly and efficiently. 
But as much as we all may say 
our moms are unstoppable, they 
are only human. And sometimes, 
they feel bad. NBC’s new family 
comedy, “I Feel Bad,” tells us 
why.

Sarayu Blue (“No Tomorrow”) 

plays Emet Kamala-Sweetzer, a 
mom that’s constantly concerned 
with the lives of her children but 
tries very hard not to show it. 
And in the first two episodes, 
she feels bad about something. In 
the premiere, she stresses over 
becoming her mother. Next, she 
feels guilty for taking just one 
self-care day from her stressful 
life. Emet takes viewers through 
each story in her voice-overs, 
taking an omniscient approach 

to the events unfolding. Her 
narration is endearing, though 
unnecessary at some points. It 
makes for an easy flow between 
scenes, but this is often broken 
by the inclusion of events Emet 
was not present at, thus making 
her voice useless.

Emet is a busy mom, and 

the people surrounding her 
aren’t exactly lightening the 
load. 
She 
is 
complemented 

by 
the 
quintessential 
goofy 

husband David (Paul Adelstein, 
“Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce”) 
who seems to just be there for 
comedic relief, which isn’t to 
say he’s not good at providing it. 
Her overbearing parents, played 
by Madhur Jaffrey (“The Only 
Living Boy in New York”) and 
Brian George (“The Big Bang 
Theory”), are always around, and 
they never miss an opportunity 
to critique her parenting.

“I Feel Bad” has all of the 

components meant to make it 
a lovable and successful show 
— cute kids, a cohesive theme, 
witty humor — but before it gets 
there it needs some serious TLC. 
This is essentially NBC’s attempt 
to emulate ABC’s “black-ish,” 
just from a mother’s point of 
view. Both shows are narrated by 
an amusing and likable parent, 
and follow that parent through 
both their family and work life. 
In Emet’s case, that work life is 
being the only female artist for 
a video game developer who’s 
primarily interested in nerdy 
men drawing big boobs on 
bikini-clad heroines. It’s a smart 
choice by writers, and easy to 
laugh at, but the men that Emet 
works with are often shown in 
scenes that Emet wouldn’t know 

were happening, like when they 
gather at a bar in one scene to 
discuss Emet’s concern that she’s 
turning into her mother. There 
is no reason these men should 
be given their own scene, and 
Emet having no way of knowing 
this is happening messes with 
the linear narrative that carries 
the show. Much like how Dre 
Johnson’s coworkers in “black-
ish” are nothing more than an 
allegory 
for 
institutionalized 

racism in the workplace, Emet’s 
vulgar coworkers would work 
best if they remained background 
characters, just a representation 
of the sexism woman face at 
work, especially in the field of 
video games.

With funny dialogue, clever 

storylines and a powerhouse 
producing lineup that includes 
Amy Poehler (“Broad City”), “I 
Feel Bad” is certainly not a lost 
cause. It’s genuinely a funny 
show, and the story has depth. 
Emet and her husband have a 
biracial family, and her Indian 
heritage is not something that 
gets ignored. Representation is 
important, especially in a show 
that develops enjoyable themes 
that appeal to the masses, like 
not wanting your daughter to 
join a provocative dance club or 
desperately trying to find just 
10 minutes for yourself. Every 
show has its kinks to work out in 
its first season, and “I Feel Bad” 
isn’t immune to that. But the 
prognosis is a good one, and soon 
enough the characters of “I Feel 
Bad” will be another charming 
TV family millions of everyday 
viewers and critics alike will 
tune in to see time and time 
again.

A brief history of grime

WORLD MUSIC COLUMN

While many would argue 

that grime’s best days were 
more than a decade ago, the 
resurgence of its popularity 
and quality begs to differ. 
True, legends such as Dizzee 
Rascal took long (and rather 
embarrassing) 
digressions 

into pop territory, but both 
old 
and 
new 
artists have 

revived the genre. Perhaps 
more importantly, it has grown 
from London and the UK to 
new markets abroad. Figures 
like Skepta and Giggs have 
found themselves remixed by 
pop stars like Drake and even 
featured on albums by rappers 
like A$AP Rocky.

Purists may bemoan the 

growing influence of American 
hip hop on the scene as a 
whole, but while it is true 
that genre distinctions have 
been blurring, the culture’s 
main 
distinctions 
remain 

prevalent. Skepta’s 2016 album 
Konnichiwa is a prime example 
of grime mixed with more 
pop tendencies. Songs such 
as “Man” and “Shutdown” 
permeated 
the 
mainstream 

charts in the UK and abroad, 
and have contributed to the 
genre’s newfound popularity. 
Others 
such 
as 
Dave, 
AJ 

Tracey (featured together in 
the marvelous “Thiago Silva”) 
and Stormzy have become 
major cultural figures in the 
UK and beyond. While their 
works 
don’t 
quite 
feature 

the level of intensity that is 
familiar to older fans of grime, 
the influence of the genre on 
their work is undeniable. In 
addition to the new bloods, 

stalwarts such as Wiley have 
released critically-acclaimed, 
more reflective albums with 
tracks that will surely become 
future 
classics. 
Old 
feuds 

have been resolved and now 

lay the ground for exciting 
collaborations 
and 
new, 

talented producers have added 
some 
needed 
variety 
and 

creativity.

What may be the biggest 

obstacle in the preservation of 
classic grime culture is the fact 
that it is not entirely an album-
oriented genre that lends well 
to streaming services. Grime’s 
best 
moments 
occurred 
in 

events such as radio mixes, 
where MC’s alternate nonstop 
for hours over a mix of classic 
instrumentals. 
Its 
feuds 

and stylistic transitions are 
labyrinthine in nature and 
hard 
to 
appreciate 
simply 

by listening to playlists of 
selected 
tracks. 
Moreover, 

the genre is borrowing more 
from American hip hop trends, 
including 
trap-style 
beats 

instead of the reggae, ragga 
and garage style beats of old.

Nonetheless, 
grime 
is 

alive and well, and the fact 
that it hasn’t taken over the 
world yet might be one of its 
appealing qualities. The genre 
is unapologetically urban and 
British, a niche subculture 
in the sea of musical styles 
that float around the world, 
co-opted by groups of all 
creed and color. Just as it 
may be difficult to completely 
appreciate a Pakistani qawwali 
tune or a French chanson, it 
may be difficult to appreciate 
the sheer complexity of the 
history of grime. However, it 
can’t stop you from enjoying 
the energy and fun that it 
brings.

What may

The world’s longest recorded 

table tennis rally happened 
on Mar. 23, 2014. Daniel and 
Peter Ives kept their volley 
alive for a total of eight hours, 
40 minutes and five seconds at 
the Plumstead Radical Working 
Men’s Club in London. The ball 
lofted back and forth, back and 
forth — an affirmative ping to 
answer each curious pong.

To 
achieve 
the 
volley’s 

remarkable longevity, the Ives 
brothers had to be on the same 
wavelength, reciprocating each 
other’s 
calm 
and 
collected 

manner as they approached the 
world record. 

In a similar fashion to the 

professional 
table 
tennis 

players, the Sklar Brothers 
were on the same comedic 
wavelength 
during 
their 

show this past Friday. Randy 
and Jason Sklar exercised an 
identical rhythm to that of 
Daniel and Peter Ives, only in 
the context of stand-up comedy.

The 
twins 
returned 
to 

Ann Arbor, their old college 

stomping ground, this weekend 
in a homecoming performance 

at the Ann Arbor Comedy 
Showcase.

I arrived early to the 10:30 

p.m. 
performance 
in 
the 

classic basement club and 
was seated spitting-distance 
from the microphones. The 
brothers met a welcoming 
round of applause as they took 
the stage and opened with 
a 
funny-because-it’s-true 

jab at Ann Arbor’s ceaseless 
construction. The rest of the 
show contained a blend of 
jokes written for parents and 
jokes written for Democrats 
(the Sklar Brothers knew 
their audience). 

That said, the material 

was sophisticated enough to 
earn the label of well-crafted 
comedy without being distant 
from the intended audience 
of graduated Ann Arborites. 
Even though I do not fit the 
profile of a graduated Ann 
Arborite parent, I still found 
myself laughing with every 
punchline, delivered like a 
volley-return.

After 
graduating 
from 

the University in 1994, the 

Sklar 
Brothers 
moved 
to 

New York to begin their 
successful comedy careers, 
making 
appearances 
on 

shows such as HBO’s “Curb 
Your Enthusiasm,” “Law and 
Order,” 
“Grey’s 
Anatomy,” 

FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in 
Philadelphia” and their series 
on the History Channel, “The 
United States of America.”

The duo act in stand-up 

comedy is a bold one, yet 
the Sklar Brothers exceeded 
expectations with a masterful 
cadence and a satisfying flow 
to each bit.

As a duo act, two comedians 

must devote extra time and 
effort 
to 
the 
coordination, 

collaboration and choreography 
of any given set. The Sklar 
Brothers are no exception to 
this added challenge, but the 
two were able to deliver their 
material in a manner that 
showed preparedness and deep 
knowledge of the set without 
seeming too rehearsed. Each 
joke was a satisfying blend 
between the two comedians, 
as 
though 
they 
were 

having a normal (hilarious) 
conversation.

Watching 
the 
Sklar 

Brothers 
is 
like 
watching 

two professional table tennis 
players keep a casual volley 
going for the fun of it. I mean 
that in the best way possible 
— these are truly talented 
performers with the comedic 
equivalent of the table tennis 
expertise displayed by Daniel 
and Peter Ives. If my Friday 
night could consist of watching 
the Sklar Brothers play comedic 
ping-pong for eight hours, 40 
minutes and five seconds, I 
would consider that a Friday 
night well-spent.

Wolverines pummel Cornhuskers, 56-10

Josh Metellus knew it was 

over after the first series.

Already up a touchdown, 

the junior safety noticed 
something askew: Nebraska 
had lost its intensity. He 
could see it in the way the 
Cornhuskers’ receivers ran 
their routes and how he got 
blocked.

“After the first series when 

they went back out there, 
you knew they wanted to 
give up,” Metellus said. “You 
could just see it in their eyes. 
It’s something you feel, it’s 
not anything I can put into 
words.”

Metellus was proven right 

as No. 19 Michigan (1-0 Big 

Ten, 3-1 overall) drubbed 
Nebraska (0-1, 0-3), 56-10, to 
cruise through its Big Ten 
opener. The only sliver of hope 
the Cornhuskers had Saturday 
dwindled within seconds.

After a 32-yard pass on 

the game’s second play, 
quarterback Adrian Martinez 
looked to have a receiver open 
on a slant. But the paw of fifth-
year senior defensive tackle 
Lawrence Marshall deflected 
the pass into Metellus’ arms 
for his second interception in 
as many weeks.

“(Marshall) tipping that 

ball just made a bad play into a 
good play,” Metellus said.

On the ensuing drive, 

redshirt junior running back 
Karan Higdon scampered 46 
yards to set up Michigan’s 

first touchdown — a punch-in 
score for Ben Mason. It was 
one of three touchdowns for 
the sophomore fullback, who 
also lined up as tailback in the 
absence of junior Chris Evans.

It was at that point — just 

one score in — that Metellus 
noticed the game had 
changed.

“We knew they didn’t want 

to play,” Metellus said. “You 
could just tell the intensity 
was kind of flat. It just gives 
you that extra fuel like, ‘You 
just made somebody not want 
to play anymore.’ ”

Nebraska looked like they 

didn’t indeed. After a quick 
three-and-out, Higdon found 
an enormous hole to score 
untouched from 44 yards 
and extend the Wolverines’ 

lead to 14-0. Returning from 
injury, Higdon finished with 
136 yards on 12 attempts — all 
in the first half. His success 
made for another light day 
for junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson, who was again 
highly-accurate with 120 
yards on 15-of-22 passing.

“Karan, I mean, he was 

ready to go,” said coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “He was ready to 
play, you could see it from 
really before the game. It was 
great to have him back.”

Nebraska was out-played on 

offense, too.

Michigan’s defensive 

line was so dominant that 
Martinez seldom had a 
chance to make a play. The 
Wolverines collected four 
sacks and 14 tackles-for-loss, 

adding up to 65 yards lost 
on those plays. Michigan 
domineered the Cornhuskers 
physically and schematically.

“The discipline (by the 

defense) in the run game was 
evident today,” Harbaugh 
said. “They didn’t run by 
the quarterback, they didn’t 
let the quarterback get out 
scrambling and the rush lanes 
were really condensed. And 
they were on the quarterback 
fast. It was good to see all 
those guys play well up front.”

Zach Gentry put the game 

further out of reach during 
the second quarter. After a 
five-yard touchdown catch, 
the redshirt junior tight end 
put his palms up in subdued 
celebration and stared blankly 
into the crowd. He was 

seemingly asking the question 
on everyone’s mind: “It’s this 
easy?”

It was easy because the 

Cornhuskers have a litany of 
issues. That much is wildly 
apparent a month into the 
Scott Frost era. But the 
Wolverines dominated from 
start to finish nonetheless, 
and that has them feeling 
confident after three straight 
wins.

“It’s starting to feel like 

(2016),” said junior guard 
Ben Bredeson. “There’s a big 
maturity jump and people are 
starting to feel it. … We want 
to be that intimidating team 
that we were in ’16. When we 
rolled down the tunnel, people 
would fear us. So we’re getting 
back to that stature.”

The ties that bind Scott Frost and Jim Harbaugh

Scott 
Frost 
sat 
down at the 
podium, 
adjusted the 
microphones 
in front of 
him 
and 
looked at the 
reporters 
waiting 
for 
an 
explanation 
of how his Nebraska football 
team had just lost by 46 points 
at Michigan Stadium.
Frost played with the collar 
of his red sweatshirt as he 
listened to the first question. 
Then he began to speak — 
bluntly and truthfully.
“I told them, I honestly 
believe this is going to be the 
bottom, right here,” Frost said. 
“I don’t know how many times 
I’ve been a part of a game like 
that, but we got beat in every 
phase.”
He paused for a couple 
seconds, and then continued.
“We’re really going to find 
out who loves football and who 
loves each other and who’s 
going to band together.”
As sobering of a message as 
any.
Put yourself in Frost’s shoes 
for a second. When the 43-year-
old coach — widely touted as 
one of the brightest young 
minds in all of college football 
— decided to come home to the 
school he quarterbacked to 
a national championship, he 
surely could not have expected 
his return to have played out 
like this.
His athletic director, Bill 
Moos, couldn’t have either. 
In April, Moos said better 
days 
were 
ahead 
for 
the 
Cornhuskers. Then he said, 
“You’ve got Urban Meyer and 
Jim Harbaugh thinking, ‘We 
better put a little more into 
that Nebraska game coming 
up.’ And that’s the way we 
want it. They’re running a 
little bit scared right now. And 

they won’t admit it. We’ll leave 
that at that.”
But if Saturday afternoon’s 
beatdown was the low point, 
then 
Nebraska 
has been on a 
collision course 
with 
rock 
bottom for quite 
some time now.
On Jan. 30, 
almost 
two 
months 
after 
his hiring, Frost 
stood in front 
of 
reporters 
and 
took 
responsibility 
for 
the 
hospitalization of two of his 
new players, who had suffered 
from rhabdomyolysis.
When the season started, 
the 
team’s 
opener 
against 
Akron was cancelled due to a 
weather-related delay, erasing 

a seemingly easy opportunity 
to start a new era on the right 
foot.
Then 
the 
Cornhuskers 
played Colorado, 
and lost when 
freshman 
phenom Adrian 
Martinez, 
the 
only scholarship 
quarterback on 
the roster, left 
the game with 
a knee injury. 
The next week, 
Nebraska 
lost 
to Troy of the 
Sun 
Belt 
conference. 
That 
brings us to Saturday, when 
the Cornhuskers played one 
of the programs they hope to 
eventually emulate. Of course, 
Brady Hoke left Jim Harbaugh 
a roster littered with highly-
rated recruits. Mike Riley left 

Scott Frost a roster.
Still, Michigan, Ohio State 
and even Wisconsin, are all 
farther in the distance than 
ever. 
Frost 
would have to 
squint to find 
them 
on 
the 
horizon.
Which 
brings 
us 
to 
the concept of 
the 
hometown 
hero, and why 
this is going to 
be so difficult 
for Frost going 
forward.
Everyone loves a hometown 
hero. They grew up alongside 
you, part of the history of 
your village, town or city. The 
place that you call home — 
they did, too, and this is where 
they found their first success, 

success that you shared, took 
part in and still remember, 
even if it was decades ago.
At some point, they might’ve 
left, to chase a 
Super Bowl or to 
win a national 
championship at 
Central Florida. 
You 
watched 
them, adoringly, 
rooting 
for 
them to do well, 
secretly hoping 
that they still 
think of home, 
still 
want 
to 
come home.
And when things do go 
wrong at home, the residents 
don’t pine for the Oregon 
State coach with a west-coast 
offense, or the West Virginia 
coach with his fancy spread 
offense.

Everyone in Lincoln had been 
waiting for the return of the 
prodigal son, the quarterback 
who 
cut 
his 
chops 
under 
the greatest coach in school 
history, just like everyone in 
Ann Arbor had been waiting 
for the return of their prodigal 
son, the quarterback who cut 
his chops under the greatest 
coach in school history.
The 
return 
seems 
like 
the most difficult step — 
convincing the hometown hero 
that his old school is worth 
rescuing, in comparison to 
some moribund NFL franchise, 
or some other Power 5 school 
in need of a boost.
Scott 
Frost 
and 
Jim 
Harbaugh both did return. 
And when they did, because 
of their past, because of what 
they did when they left home, 
because of everything they 
meant to their schools, no 
one expected failure. No one 
expected a loss to Troy. No 
one expected losing to Ohio 
State, year after year.
This 
past 
Tuesday, 
Harbaugh 
was 
asked 
if 
coaching at his alma mater was 
different than his previous 
jobs.
He thought about it, and 
then 
answered 
the 
way 
everyone knew he would.
“Yeah. 
Yes,” 
Harbaugh 
said. “I would say it is. It’s 
heightened.”
These are the ties that bind 
Frost 
and 
Harbaugh, 
two 
men who have unenviable 
tasks ahead of them. Both 
coaches are home now. To 
many, getting here might have 
seemed like the most difficult 
step. But as Scott Frost, and 
maybe Jim Harbaugh, would 
tell you, the most difficult 
part is what happens after you 
come home.

Michigan felt Nebraska “didn’t want it as bad”

Midway 
through 
the 
second quarter, the result of 
the Michigan football team’s 
game against Nebraska was no 
longer in question.
It was 30-0 already, and 
the Cornhuskers (0-1 Big Ten, 
0-3 overall) were backed up 
on their own 20-yard line. 
Nebraska quarterback Adrian 
Martinez 
dropped back to 
throw and faced 
pressure like he 
saw all day. This 
time, fifth-year 
senior defensive 
end 
Chase 
Winovich 
chased 
him 
down 
for 
the 
third 
of 
four 
sacks 
the 
Wolverines (1-0, 3-1) had in 
their 56-10 victory.
Then Winovich stood up and 
motioned as if he was pulling 
something out of his chest to 
take a bite out of it.
“After the sack, I figured if 
I was gonna take their heart 
from their offense, I figured it 
was about time that I took my 
own heart and ate that too,” 
Winovich said. “That’s kind of 
where I was at with that one. 
Some people thought I was 
eating a grenade. That was not 
the case. That was me taking 
my own heart and eating it.”
The 
rest 
of 
Michigan’s 
defense felt similarly, though 
maybe without the ripping-
out-your-own-heart part. The 
Wolverines 
were 
swarming 
all over the field, and they 
held Nebraska to just 132 
total yards, the lowest of any 
Michigan 
opponent 
since 
Rutgers on Oct. 8, 2016.
After 
the 
game, 
the 
Wolverines said they could 
feel the Cornhuskers’ offense 
begin to break, and according 
to them, it happened early.
“After the first series,” said 
junior safety Josh Metellus, 
who 
intercepted 
a 
tipped 
pass to end that first series 
of the game. “… You can just 

see it in their eyes. It’s like 
something you feel. It’s not 
really anything I could put 
into words. You can just tell by 
the way a receiver’s running 
his route or the way you’re 
getting blocked or the type of 
passion they’re playing with. 
We just sensed that they didn’t 
have it, so we just used that to 
our advantage.”
Added Winovich: “You just 
feel it. I don’t 
know, 
there’s 
something 
about 
this 
game. 
There’s 
an energy to it, 
where you look 
at the person 
across from you 
and 
whether 
it’s their play 
calling and how 
they 
operate. 
How they move about. I don’t 
know. I just didn’t feel like 
they wanted it as bad as we 
did.”
That’s 
a 
feeling 
that 
Michigan’s defense has felt at 
times throughout the last four 
seasons. But this season, fair 
or not, the defense has come 

under some fire for giving 
up big plays and untimely 
penalties.
So, save against Western 
Michigan, it would be hard 
to say that the Wolverines 
struck that kind of fear into 
opposing offenses like they did 
Nebraska.
“I feel like every week, 
we’re getting better and better 
with, you know, not getting 
penalties 
or 
not 
blowing 
coverages and 
stuff like that,” 
Metellus 
said. 
“You know, it’s 
a long season. 
You know, it’s 
football. 
You 
mess up, like, 
that’s what the 
game is. But, 
you know, we 
just try to find a way to limit 
each mistake every week. So, 
you know, I feel like going in 
to these next couple of weeks, 
we just still gonna harp on not 
messing up, not getting dumb 
penalties and stuff like that.”
Another 
good 
sign 
for 
Michigan was that it finally 

stopped a mobile quarterback, 
like it struggled to do against 
SMU and, especially, Notre 
Dame. 
Martinez 
finished 
with -12 rushing yards and 
just 22 through the air. The 
Cornhuskers 
averaged 
1.3 
yards per carry and 2.4 yards 
per play. 
So 
the 
improvements 
that 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
talked about are becoming 
noticeable, even 
for 
a 
defense 
that 
didn’t 
have 
all 
that 
much room for 
improvement.
“It’s 
just 
success, 
man, 
it’s 
just 
a 
cyclical nature,” 
Winovich 
said. 
“And 
we’ve 
learned from a 
lot of our mistakes, and, you 
know, we’re not stopping here. 
I think the sky’s the limit. 
You’ve seen how well our 
defense performed today, and 
we’re hungrier than ever.”
In 
Winovich’s 
case, 
apparently, that’s a hunger for 
hearts.

Players getting “2016 
vibe” with dominance

After three blowout wins, the 
Michigan football team is riding 
high. The Wolverines have won 
their last three games — against 
Western Michigan, SMU and 
Nebraska — by a combined 127 
points. It’s the first time Michigan 
has outscored its opponents by 
120-plus points in a three week 
span since the first three games of 
2016.
The Wolverines have scored 150 
points, their highest three-game 
point total since the middle of 
2016 — a stretch against Rutgers, 
Illinois and Michigan State.
Junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson has thrown for seven 
touchdown passes the last three 
weeks, the highest three-game 
total from a Michigan quarterback 
since Wilton Speight in the first 
three weeks of 2016.
Noticing a trend?
“This is the most 2016 vibe I’d 
say we have,” said fifth-year senior 
defensive end Chase Winovich. 
“Just going to work and maturity-
wise, everybody’s accountable for 
their position, you have ballers 
on every level. And it’s a great 
feeling.”
Most remember that 2016 
season for the heartbreak at the 
end, not the utter dominance 
that led up to it. The Wolverines 
ascended to No. 2 in the polls, 
trampling 
opponents 
with 
a suffocating defense and a 
commanding running game. It 
was Jim Harbaugh’s second year, 
and it appeared all of his promises 
were on the verge of fruition.
You know how it ended — a 
troubling night in Iowa City raised 
doubt about a magical run, then a 
loss at Ohio State that will live in 
infamy. 
That was the closest Michigan 
has come to a Big Ten title and 
beyond since the mid-2000s; a 
talented team top-to-bottom. One 
that was generally mistake-free 
and efficient, took care of inferior 
foes, competed with top-notch 
opponents.
Last year, Michigan’s largest 

margin of victory was 25 points. 
The Wolverines didn’t score more 
than 36 points in a single game, 
nor did they allow fewer than 10. 
Above that, though less tangible, 
few games felt comfortable.
Though against clearly inferior 
foes, Michigan is back to that 2016 
feeling.
Harbaugh, 
for 
what 
it’s 
worth, 
has 
been 
especially 
complimentary on the way his 
team practices and prepares.
“What really stands out is, 
our team is working hard and it’s 
paying off for them,” Harbaugh 
said after Saturday’s 56-10 win 
over Nebraska. “It’s showing they 
like to practice, and then they’re 
improving. It’s an improving, 
ascending team. And it’s paying 
off.
“They don’t — they actually 
get it, ramp it up every day. They 
don’t need — they don’t need 
motivational swings or talks or 
any, some of the things that some 
teams need. They just go to work, 
and looks like they enjoy it, that 
part of it.”
The parallels are far from 
perfect, though. For one — an 
especially notable one — Michigan 
has already lost a game, against the 
only nationally competitive team 
it has played. That game revealed 
potentially damming flaws. 
With this recent string of 
dominant 
performances 
over 
inferior foes, sanity and confidence 
have been restored to a fanbase 
that desperately needed both. 
Whether it continues through the 
heart of Big Ten play, of course, 
remains to be seen.
But 
it’s 
notable 
players 
would 
independently 
affirm 
those parallels. It’s a cultural 
comparison as much as any 
statistical, on-the-field similarity. 
If players feel it, maybe that’s all 
that matters. 
“There’s a big maturity jump 
happening, people are starting to 
feel it. We want to be the type of 
intimidating team we were in ‘16. 
When we rolled down the tunnel, 
people feared us,” said junior 
tackle Ben Bredeson. “We think 
we’re getting back to that.”

Hallahan is difference- 
maker once again for ‘M’ 

Jack Hallahan had been there 
before – Penn State, double 
overtime, sudden death, game-
winning goal hanging in the 
balance.
Friday night was a lot of the 
same for the junior, except for the 
fairy tale ending.
Drawing 
1-1 
with the Nittany 
Lions 
(1-0-1 
Big 
Ten, 
2-4-1 
overall), Michigan 
made it a point 
to feed Hallahan 
the ball time and 
time again, hoping 
he would break 
through like he 
did last year in 
the waning seconds to give the 
Wolverines (1-0-1, 5-1-1) three 
points. But he was the reason 
Michigan even got a single point 
in the Big Ten table.
Leading the Wolverines in 
both shots on goal and crosses in 
a game where Michigan clearly 
dominated, 
Hallahan 
netted 
the 
equalizer, 
striking a ball 
that 
deflected 
off a Penn State 
defender before 
bouncing 
past 
the keeper.
“Honestly, 
(assistant 
coach 
Tommy 
McMenemy) 
said to me when 
I’m crossing it, 
when I cut in, aim for the far post 
because if (the ball) misses, then 
it’ll go in the net,” Hallahan said. 
“So, I just kept doing that basically 
until it went in.
“I think that (crossing) is one 
of the key parts of my game,” the 
junior continued. “One of my 
main strengths when I’m playing 
is trying to be a man that can get 
a cross in and normally, we’ve got 
men on the end of the ball and we 

get a lot of goals from that. It’s 
whatever is best for the team in 
that sense and crossing is good for 
us.”
Creating chance after chance, it 
seemed as if Hallahan would serve 
as a hero in the closing minutes 
once again. Dribbling along the 
right edge of the box, Hallahan 
wound up a shot only to have his 
legs taken out by 
the Penn State 
goalkeeper.
“I took a bit 
too 
heavy 
of 
a touch, and I 
wanted to get 
a shot after it,” 
Hallahan 
said. 
“At that point, I 
tried to cross it 
(but) the keeper 
came 
and 
I 
cramped up on my calf.”
As a result, Hallahan spiraled 
into the wall, and a deafening 
silence 
ensued 
around 
the 
stadium as he struggled to get 
up. He eventually hobbled off his 
injury and jogged back to the side 
of the field that he had controlled 
all night.
“He 
carried 
the 
load 
on 
the field,” said 
Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “I 
think (Hallahan) 
got off to a hot 
start 
and 
you 
know, it’s a simple 
equation. 
Like 
any other sport, 
if someone’s hot, 
give 
them 
the 
ball. Let’s see if they can figure it 
out. There’s no real coaching to 
that.”
All 
Daley 
did 
was 
leave 
Hallahan in for all 110 minutes, 
the first time Hallahan has played 
a full game this season. And with 
a goal or assist in the last five out 
of six games as well as a start 
in the last four, it doesn’t look 
like the Englishman will be 
disappearing any time soon.

Seniors propel ‘M’ to impressive weekend

Fall tennis is a time for players 
to get back into their groove and 
tweak their game before the real 
season starts. Because of that, 
the Michigan women’s tennis 
team is already in mid-season 
form. 
While most of the team 
traveled 
to 
the 
Miami 
Invitational, two players — No. 
18 senior Kate Fahey and No. 33 
junior transfer Giulia Pairone — 
were invited to the prestigious 
Oracle ITA Masters in California. 
“I think they try to take the 
best player from each conference 
and then send them out to 
Malibu and then they kind of fill 
the rest of the spots with at-large 
bids,” said Michigan associate 
head coach Teryn Ashley-Fitch. 
“There’s a lot of good competition 
out there. I would say it’s one of 
the biggest events of the fall.”
And it didn’t take long for 
Fahey to prove why she was 
there.
Fahey made an impressive 
run to the semifinals before 
ultimately 
falling 
in 
three 
sets to Pepperdine’s No. 41 
Evgeniya Levashova, 6-2, 1-6, 
6-2. But it wasn’t an easy path 
to get there — Fahey played four 
singles matches in three days, 
including a three-set thriller in 
the quarterfinals where Fahey 
fought off a match point to win 
the third-set tiebreaker for the 
match. 
The 
semifinals 
became 
a 
familiar spot for Fahey as she 
and her partner Stefan Milicevic 
of Minnesota made it to the 
semifinal round in the mixed 
doubles draw. By random draw, 
the pair was thrown together 
and proved to be a dynamic duo. 
They went 18-9 over the first 
three matches before dropping 
the semifinal match, 8-4. 
Fahey 
has 
proved 
herself 
as Michigan’s top performer, 
but due to some newfound 
confidence, she is making a 
bigger name for herself on the 

national stage.
“She’s shown so much progress 
on the court,” Ashley-Fitch said. 
“And mentally, for sure, has 
made some great improvements 
and I think it’s helped her tennis. 
I think she’s finally realizing that 
to get the best out of her, she’s got 
to be in a good frame of mind. I 
think for me that was the biggest 
takeaway from the weekend for 
her.”
While Fahey’s fellow senior 
Brienne Minor was across the 
country in Miami, both women 
are clearly leading the team by 
example. At this point last year, 
Minor was still recovering from 
a knee surgery that sidelined 
her for all of the fall season. 
But the difference of a year can 
be important as Minor took all 
three matches over the weekend 
without even dropping a set. 
And while Minor won her 
semifinal match, finals matches 
were not held in the singles draw. 
But two victories over top-100 
ranked opponents and a clean 

sheet on the weekend is enough 
for Minor. 
“She has a great weekend,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 
Bernstein. “I think for her, all 
three matches (she) played really, 
really well and kept her level up. 
So, if we can get them from her as 
we move into the fall and season, 
you know to have her back at that 
level would be great. 
“So really excited for her and 
she showed a lot of heart this 
weekend. Competed hard against 
three great kids, so definitely a 
good weekend for her.”
While Fahey and Minor may 
have been able to use their 
experience 
to 
power 
them 
through 
the 
weekend, 
the 
Wolverines also feature many 
fresh faces in the lineup who still 
made an impact as well. 
Pairone, a transfer student 
from Arkansas, won her first-
round match before falling in 
three sets. She battled to the end, 
fighting off three match points 
before succumbing to Winthrop’s 

No. 
26 
Lauren 
Proctor. 
Sophomore Bella Lorenzini and 
freshman Anca Craciun won all 
three doubles matches in the B 
draw to win the title. 
And while Michigan had a 
successful weekend, Bernstein 
viewed this opportunity as more 
than a chance to play tennis. 
While fall tennis is often very 
individual, due to the lack of 
team scoring, Bernstein used the 
occasion to let her team bond and 
get used to each other. While the 
veteran players impressed on the 
court, Bernstein was much more 
impressed with them off the 
court. 
“You know they’re cheering 
for each other and supporting 
each other,” Bernstein said. “It 
felt like a team event even though 
it wasn’t. And really the new kids 
feeling comfortable — you know, 
they’re away from home and have 
only been here a couple weeks for 
far, so they really got to know the 
older kids on our team, so it was a 
fun weekend.”

What you missed when you 
left at halftime: Nebraska

Just like its last two games, the 
Michigan football team had fans 
leaving long before the game was 
over against Nebraska on Saturday.
That’s because it was 39-0, and 
the Cornhuskers had 17 total yards 
in the first 30 minutes.
It only got uglier in the second 
frame. But if you were at the game, 
you probably left during the band 
show and missed that part, opting 
instead for a fulfilling postgame 
nap.
So for your information, The 
Daily breaks down what happened 
after you left Saturday’s game at 
halftime.
DPJ punt return touchdown
This was probably the most 
exciting play of the entire game. 
Sophomore 
wide 
receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones has had 
his fair share of struggles in the 
punt-return game.
But on Saturday, Peoples-Jones 
took his second career punt return 
to the house.
Peoples-Jones caught it on 
his own 40, sprinted to his right, 
looped around the punt team, 
cut back to the left, busted a final 
defender with a spin move and 
front-flipped into the end zone for 
a 60-yard score.
“Donovan had a great — 
has been blocking extremely 
well,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “Showed up on the 
punt return, there was some great 
blocks there. Yeah, just, I thought 
physically our team played well 
today.”
The 
play 
was 
fairly 
meaningless, 
as 
the 
game 
was already out of hand. But 
it did exhibit the continued 
development of Peoples-Jones, 
who has showed his ability in 
the receiving game, but had yet 
to break it out in the return game 
this season.
McCaffrey 
continues 
to 
impress
One of the more unsung 
storylines of this season has 
been the steadiness of redshirt 
freshman 
quarterback 
Dylan 
McCaffrey 
in 
the 
backup 

quarterback role.
He first came in against Notre 
Dame and was surprisingly steady 
while starter Shea Patterson 
recovered from cramping issues. 
Then, against Western Michigan, 
McCaffrey threw his first career 
touchdown on his only pass of the 
game.
On 
Saturday, 
McCaffrey 
continued his steadiness.
His first play, he went 75 yards 
to the house on a read option play, 
but it was called back because 
of a holding penalty. No matter, 
as McCaffrey still finished the 
game 3-for-8 for 86 yards, 56 of 
which came on a touchdown to 
freshman receiver Ronnie Bell.
“Dylan continues to improve 
every time he gets in,” Harbaugh 
said. “That’s a position like all 
the positions in football, but 
especially quarterback, it takes 
playing and having time on task 
and being out there. And it — he’s 
getting that. It doesn’t — it’s never 
too big for him. I really like that 
about Dylan. So, all good there.”
Aidan Hutchinson solid in 
relief
Late in the first half, junior 
defensive 
end 
Rashan 
Gary 
seemed to hurt his shoulder. 
After that, freshman defensive 
end Aidan Hutchinson came 
in to replace him. And though 
Hutchinson went down with 
an injury for a short time, too, 
he finished solidly with three 
tackles, including one for a loss.
His most impressive stretch 
came in the early fourth quarter. 
First, the Cornhuskers handed 
it off to running back Devine 
Ozigbo, and Hutchinson squeezed 
through the line and forced 
Ozigbo to bounce outside, where 
Hutchinson and junior VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson wrestled him 
down.
The play immediately after, 
Nebraska 
backup 
quarterback 
Andrew Bunch kept the ball on 
a zone read and ran towards the 
left. 

The good, the bad and the ugly: ‘M’ vs. Nebraska

The good: I have to choose?

The Michigan football team 
(1-0 Big Ten, 3-1 overall) was 
as dominant as it has ever been 
in Jim Harbaugh’s tenure on 
Saturday — almost everything 
that could have gone well in 
the 
Wolverines’ 
56-10 
win 
over Nebraska (0-1, 0-3), did. 
Cornhuskers coach Scott Frost 
acknowledged 
it 
was 
rock 
bottom for his squad and that 
they got “whipped,” a stark 
contrast from Frost claiming his 
UCF team “outhit” Michigan in 
a 37-point loss in 2016.
Shea Patterson once again 
gave 
Wolverine 
fans 
every 
reason to keep smiling. The 
junior quarterback completed 
15 of 22 passes for 120 yards 
and spearheaded the efficient 
offense with an easy touchdown 
throw to redshirt junior tight 
end Zach Gentry. Perhaps more 
reassuring was the performance 
of backup quarterback Dylan 
McCaffrey, 
who 
replaced 
Patterson with 5:23 left in the 
third quarter.
On his first snap, McCaffrey 
flashed his wheels for a near 
75-yard touchdown run, if not 
for a holding call on Oliver 
Martin. McCaffrey, later in the 
drive, had a 17-yard run and 
15-yard toss to Martin. The 
redshirt freshman also threw a 
dime into the hands of freshman 
Ronnie Bell for a 56-yard score 
— his first career reception. The 
resounding performances were 
in part due to a stable showing 
by the offensive line, which only 
surrendered one sack and one 
hurry the whole afternoon.
In the blowout, the offense 
reached far into the depth 
chart; 
Harbaugh 
mentioned 
that 78 players saw the field 
Saturday. After senior running 
back Karan Higdon finished his 
business — 12 carries, 136 yards 
and a touchdown — fullback Ben 
Mason got three touchdowns 
on six carries, and No. 3, 4 and 
5 backs Tru Wilson, O’Maury 
Samuels and Christian Turner 
combined for 22 carries and 121 
yards.

This depth wasn’t just help 
to the offense, however. Senior 
VIPER Jordan Glasgow, who 
replaced Khaleke Hudson in the 
first half because of a targeting 
call last week, impressed with 
a sack and hurry. The whole 
defensive line got to Nebraska 
quarterback Adrian Martinez 
at will to collect four sacks 
and four hurries. Overall, 27 
defensemen recorded tackles 
and kept the Cornhuskers out 
of the endzone until the end of 
garbage time.
“I thought our team played 
very physical, in all phases,” 
Harbaugh 
said. 
“Offensively, 
defensively, 
special 
teams. 
Showed up in a lot of the one-on-
one matchups, showed up in the 
goal-line, short yardage football 
on both sides.”
That plainly sums it up.

The bad: it doesn’t really 
mean anything.

Michigan 
hasn’t 
won 
against a team in the top 70 of 
the S&P+ Ratings — a metric 
that quantifies explosiveness, 
efficiency, field position and 
finishing drives. It has, however, 
lost to Notre Dame, which ranks 
11th — a better indicator of the 
Wolverines’ future that features 

four Top-20 teams.
So yes, Michigan has played 
masterfully 
the 
past 
three 
weeks. But expectations over the 
weaker slate were only slightly 
below what the Wolverines have 
shown on the field.
Thus, the question remains: 
can Jim Harbaugh win a big 
game with Michigan? The loss 
to the Fighting Irish says more 
about that possibility than wins 
against Western Michigan, SMU 
and Nebraska combined.
The coachspeak continues, 
and Harbaugh will list all of 
his players’ accomplishments 
as usual. One question about 
Higdon and Chris Evans evolved 
into praise for Wilson, Turner, 
Mason, Bell, McCaffrey, kicker 
Quinn Nordin and punter Will 
Hart.
“Good to see those other guys 
getting play,” Harbaugh said. 
“I don’t know if this is a record 
or whatever, we played 78 guys 
today. And not only good for the 
morale of the team, but it’s good 
for the progress of the team.”
Oh, 
and 
can 
I 
critique 
Donovan Peoples-Jones’ 60-yard 
punt return touchdown? He 
spun way too early around the 
Nebraska defender in pursuit.

The ugly: targeting … again.

It’s clear why junior VIPER 
Khaleke Hudson was given a go 
in a foregone game in the third 
quarter. After missing the first 
half of Saturday’s game because 
of a targeting call last week, 
Hudson could afford a few drives 
so as to not be any bit rusty on 
the road at Northwestern next 
week.
But up 56-3 with seven 
minutes 
remaining, 
Hudson 
was inexplicably still on the 
field. And again, the junior was 
ejected for a clear targeting on 
Nebraska quarterback Andrew 
Bunch. If you’re Hudson, you 
claim you never really look at 
the scoreboard. But if you’re 
Harbaugh, there is no good 
reason to keep not only a starter, 
but one of your best defenders 
on the field.
Hudson will now miss the first 
half of next week’s game. His 
absence against the Wildcats 
again shouldn’t prove to be 
crucial, but it’s another deficient 
element 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense that has persisted.
Nordin also missed an extra 
point Saturday. He made a 
50-yard field goal and five 
other extra points, too, but any 
coach would rather not put one 
thought into the extra point.

Mason has career day in rout of Nebraska

Ben Mason’s objectives each 
game are simple.
“Just come in, attack people 
and do the best that I can,” the 
sophomore fullback said after 
the Michigan football team’s 
56-10 whooping over Nebraska 
on Saturday.
Mason, commonly referenced 
as the Wolverines’ “toughest 
player,” checked off those boxes 
quickly. And then he added one 
more to-do.
“About midweek, coach (Jim 
Harbaugh) told me that they need 
me to run the ball a little bit,” 
Mason said. “There’s no problem 
with that whatsoever. Just go in 
there and run.”
Mason had six carries for 18 
yards and three touchdowns 
— in the first half. Prior to the 
game, Mason’s career statline 
in five previous appearances 
was six carries, 10 yards and 
three touchdowns. Rushing isn’t 
necessarily the fullback’s bread 
and butter, but he proved it to be 
another weapon in his arsenal 
separate from his run-blocking.
“Personally, I think I can do a 
lot of things as a football player,” 
Mason said. “Today was really 
the first time you got to see me as 
a single back.”
In front of the media on 
Wednesday, running backs coach 
Jay 
Harbaugh 
characterized 
Mason’s mindset acerbically — he 
wants to “smash everything” and 
“bludgeon people.”
On his first and third scores, 
that is exactly what Mason did, 
barrelling up the middle of the 
offensive line. But for his second 
touchdown, Mason sauntered to 
the endzone untouched from four 
yards out — an unusual situation 
for the team’s toughest player.
The scoring outburst garnered 
praise from last year’s fullback 
and touchdown vulture Khalid 
Hill, who was crowdsourcing on 
Twitter to tell Harbaugh to “give 
the ball to Ben one more time” for 
a fourth touchdown.

Mason’s emergence came in 
part because Chris Evans was held 
off the field — the junior running 
back suffered an undisclosed 
injury 
in 
last 
week’s 
game 
against SMU. But Mason made 
his presence known. His punch-
ins were what blew the doors off 
against the Cornhuskers, and kept 
himself, a massive fullback, in as 
the 
impromptu 
No. 2 running 
back.
“Inertia 
was 
the main factor 
in the decision,” 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
said. “When he 
gets going — I 
think he’s 258 
pounds — he gets 
moving fast. He’s 
running 
hard. 
He’s got a talent and ability.
“Like having Ben Mason in 
the game. Talk about physical 
player, he’s known as that on our 
team already, and we’re taking 
advantage of his skillset.”
Mason’s 
touchdowns 
stole 
the show, but he continued to 

excel in what he knows best in 
run protection. At the Nebraska 
44-yard line, Mason sealed off 
a right-side edge rusher while 
Karan Higdon — who toted the 
ball 12 times for 136 yards — 
charged left through a wide gap 
for the Wolverines’ only other 
rushing touchdown.
“Competitiveness, 
hard 
work,” 
Higdon 
said on what he 
admires 
about 
Mason. “He’s a 
hard runner. He 
definitely 
has 
that 
hard-hat 
mindset, and you 
can see it when he 
runs or when he’s 
blocking. I love 
running 
behind 
him.”
Mason’s blocking and all-
around, hard-nosed play was 
emblematic 
of 
Michigan’s 
most 
impressive 
blocking 
performance 
this 
season. 
Mason was not a spark plug 
— he was another cog in an 
unusually cohesive offensive 

line.
“As an offensive line, they 
were pushing people off the 
ball and making enormous 
holes for the backs to run 
through,” Mason said. “It was 
a great thing to see for the 
offense.
“I think today that was a 
great statement for the team 
as far as being a tough physical 
football team.”
Mason’s performance even 
captured 
the 
attention 
of 
SportsCenter, which tweeted a 
comparison of Mason’s statline 
to all of Nebraska’s offense — 
21 total yards to Mason’s 18 at 
the time of his third score.
Mason, of course, didn’t 
chime in on the attention that 
his 
performance 
received 
online. It wasn’t a part of his 
typical game regimen.
“As a team, we just did a very 
good job of doing what was 
asked of us,” Mason said.
Whether it was his running 
or 
blocking, 
the 
team’s 
toughest player can tip his cap 
to something.

And this time, silence

There 
were 
probably 
several 
different 
ways 
Nebraska 
coach Scott 
Frost 
saw 
Saturday’s 
game going.
Maybe he 
expected a hefty loss. Perhaps 
he still expected his team 
to “out-hit” Michigan, as he 
infamously 
told 
reporters 
after a 51-14 loss to Michigan 
in 2016, when he was still 
coaching at UCF. Who knows, 
maybe 
he 
even 
thought 
Nebraska would win.
I’m fairly certain getting 
lambasted by a hamburger 
chain on Twitter by the third 
quarter didn’t cross his mind. 
And 
yet, 
it’s 
the 
most 
succinct summation of the 
utter 
drubbing 
that 
was 
Saturday’s contest — a 56-10 
loss to the Wolverines that 
somehow felt like it should’ve 
been worse. The very epitome 
of rock bottom.
Scott Frost likes to talk. It’s 
a personality trait Michigan 
fans know all too well.
In 1997, some would argue 
his 
impassioned 
plea 
on 
television 
robbed 
the 
Wolverines 
of 
a solo national 
championship. 
After 
winning 
the 
Orange 
Bowl, 
Frost 
made his plea 
for the then-No. 
2 Cornhuskers 
to claim a share 
of the National 
Title.
“You 
know, 
if 
all 
the 
pollsters 
honestly 
think, 
after watching the Rose Bowl 
and 
watching 
the 
Orange 
Bowl, that Michigan could 
beat Nebraska,” Frost said at 
the time, “go ahead and vote 
Michigan, by all means.”

Count 
fifth-year 
senior 
Chase Winovich — less than 
two years old in 1997 — 
among 
those 
who remembers 
Frost’s 
antics. 
After the game, 
Winovich 
unequivocally 
said 
Frost’s 
comments 
were 
used 
as 
motivation this 
week.
“It’s 
been 
all week. Like 
everyone 
finds 
something 
to cling to — locker room 
banter 
almost,” 
Winovich 
said. “For us, it was that for 
this week I’d say. It goes back, 
historically, look back at the 
’97 year, where we had the 
national 
championship 
and 
all the drama that went down 

there. There’s been a lot of 
motivation for us.”
He then added, “Yeah, I 
think we out-
hit them today.”
For 
Frost 
and 
Nebraska, 
though, 
today 
had little to do 
with the past. 
Not while the 
avalanche 
of 
the 
present 
came tumbling 
down into an 
unwieldy mess.
This was supposed to be 
the game to lay a foundation 
for the Frost era. Sure, an 
0-2 start was rocky. But this 
was a chance to show at least 
glimpses of the promise of 
national 
prominence 
that 
came with the Frost era.
That foundation is nowhere 

to 
be 
seen. 
Instead, 
the 
existent 
hole 
just 
keeps 
getting deeper.
It 
wasn’t 
just 
that 
the 
Cornhuskers 
lost, to extend 
their FBS-high 
seven-game 
losing streak. It 
wasn’t even just 
that they lost by 
46. Or that their 
quarterback 
Adrian 
Martinez had 10 
total yards. 
It 
was 
the 
lifelessness, 
the sheer incompetence, the 
demoralization of a once-elite 
program 
discovering 
what 
rock bottom looks like. And 
a coach left to try his best to 
plug every hole just to keep 
the ship afloat.

Saturday when Frost spoke, 
he spoke with a malaise. This 
wasn’t the Scott Frost of his 
boisterous past. 
He pleaded for 
trust 
— 
that 
he could turn 
things 
around 
for a program 
now 0-3 for the 
first time since 
1945. 
When 
he 
answered 
questions, 
he 
looked 
like 
a deer in the 
headlights.
He didn’t dare take any 
silver-linings from this one — 
no subtle jabs at Michigan as 
he did after losing by 37 points 
in 2016. I suppose the 46-point 
margin this time around was 
just a bit too large. He said 
things that sounded nice, but 

really didn’t mean much. 
For example: “We’re not 
ready to beat a team like this 
yet. The key word to me is 
yet. Because I know where 
it’s going. That’s not going as 
quickly as I would like, but 
I’m kinda excited because it’s 
not going to get worse than 
this, it’s only up from here.”
For another: “I think our 
whole team needs to see what 
it looks like now to play at 
that level. We weren’t ready 
to play at that level today. 
Adrian is going to be a great 
player 
at 
Nebraska 
for 
a 
long time. I hope he never 
experiences a day as rough as 
this one.”
And a third: “If there was 
something I could snap my 
fingers and fix, I would.”
And so on, and so forth. It’s 
possible Scott Frost turns into 
the wunderkind that he was 
touted after self-declaring his 
UCF team national champions 
last year; it would be unwise 
to write anything off after 
three games. Michigan fans 
probably don’t care right now.
Despite 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim Harbaugh claiming he 
didn’t know about Frost’s 2016 
comment (one Winovich all-
but debunked minutes later), 
the players made it clear 
there’s 
extra 
satisfaction 
from 
this 
one. That lays 
squarely 
at 
the feet of one 
Scott Frost. 
“I think he 
can he eat his 
words,” 
said 
junior running 
back 
Karan 
Higdon.
Maybe he could wash them 
down with a Wendy’s burger 
and fries, too.
