Increased depression found in 
high-SES Black Communities

Researcher discovers 
 
 
 

high depression rates 

even in wealthy 
communities 

By MATT HARMON

Daily News Editor

In an effort to quantify the 

impact of racism in the United States 
through statistical analysis, the New 
York Times Upshot reportedlast 
March that Black men, even those 
raised in wealthy households similar 
to their white counterparts, tended 
to see their average salaries diminish 
at a higher rate than white men as 
they entered the workforce. Shervin 
Assari’s lab at the University of 
Michigan continues to study this lack 
of equal outcomes between white 
and Black Americans despite similar 
resources, with his recent paper 
finding a higher rate of depression 
among high-socioeconomic status 
Black citizens than white people 
from similar backgrounds.

The paper, which was published 

in “Brain Sciences” last month, 
used data from 810 Black children 
who participated in the National 
Survey of American Life Adolescent 
Supplement 
and 
tracked 
the 

children’s 
levels 
of 
perceived 

discrimination in relation to the rates 
of 30-day, 12-month and lifetime 
major depressive disorder, finding 
a 
positive 
association 
between 

discrimination and depression in 
these higher-SES populations.

Assari, the primary researcher 

on the paper, has been conducting 
research 
with 
this 
model 
of 

comparing the outcomes of Black 
and white American with the same 
resources. This recent paper dives 
into the health implications of such 
a relationship. Assari maintained 
this theory is not limited to this 
specific study but has been explored 
and continually confirmed in other 
papers he has worked on and by 
outside sources like the Upshot 
report.

“Across the board, when you look 

at the effects of economic resources 
like 
education, 
employment, 

income and you look at the health 

outcome, life-expectancy, number 
of years people live, chronic disease, 
how much they stay healthy or 
depression, you see a pattern with all 
white men, particularly boys, being 
… advantaged compared to Blacks,” 
Assari said.

When considering variables such 

as SES, with varying metrics such 
as income levels, position on the 
poverty index, and discrimination, 
Assari’s lab took care to consider 
the differences between subjective 
and objective wealth. According 
to Brianna Preiser, a research 
technician intermediate in Assari’s 
lab and the second author on the 
paper, subjective wealth considers 
how 
well 
off 
people 
believe 

themselves to be while more 
objective studies look strictly at how 
high they are above the poverty 
index. Preiser said the study treats 
subjective SES with high regard 
because the opinions and emotions 
around high-SES populations can 
have a very large impact on mental 
health and depression rates.

AAPD says
break-ins may 
be connected 
A single suspect has 
been identified in 
several home invasions

By ABBY TAKAS 

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor Police Department 

has reported as many as five of the 
recent home invasions that began in 
April may be related. 

The suspect is a white male, 20 to 

30 years in age, and 5 feet 6 inches 
to 5 feet 9 inches in height. Victims 
of the invasions reported he was 
seen in dark clothing and in some 
instances had his face covered. A 
green mask was recovered at the 
home invaded on the 400 block of 
South Seventh St. 

A resident of the home on South 

Seventh Street reported she was 
asleep on her couch when the 
intruder attempted to rape her. The 
woman fought the man off, bit him 
and screamed. The suspect fled the 
scene as a family member ran into 
the room. The female victim was not 
injured. 

In two other incidents, female 

residents awoke to the intruder 
inside their bedrooms. A resident 
living on the 1000 block of Church 
St. reported she awoke to the 
intruder sexually assaulting her. 

Though the number of recent 

home invasions have incited local 
alarm, AAPD has stated the recent 
series of invasions doesn’t indicate 
an increase in overall break-ins for 
the city. As the number of recent 
home invasions have incited local 
alarm, many University of Michigan 
students are taking precautionary 
measures.

New Ford program
funds collaboration

Research and public 
policy program helps 
students engage with 
organizations

By SAYALI AMIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Made possible by a $1.5 million gift 
from the Power Foundation, a new 
program for the University of Michigan 
will be housed in the Ford School of 
Public Policy to engage students and 
faculty with people and organizations 
in public policy.
Elisabeth Gerber, Public Policy 
associate dean for research and policy 
engagement, will be leading the new 
program known as the Program in 
Practical Policy Engagement (P3E). This 
program creates learning opportunities 
for students outside of a classroom 
setting, while allowing students and 
faculty to collaborate with different 
types of organizations whether they 
be governmental organizations or 
nonprofits.
“The intention of the program is to 
make it easier and more accessible for 

students and faculty to engage with real 
world policy organizations, working 
on real problems,” Gerber said. “We’re 
not really organized to engage with 
organizations outside of our campus.”
When finding organizations to work 
with, Gerber said it is important to 
ensure that the skills of the students and 
faculty match the type of problem that 
needs to be solved. P3E can help with 
the matching of these organizations. 
“Finding that match, it’s time 
consuming, it takes practice, it takes 
patience, it takes cultural competency 
depending on the types of organizations 
that we’re working with,” Gerber said.
Methods of engaging with outside 
organizations currently exist within the 
University, however they are disjointed. 
P3E’s goal is to bring together those on 
campus who are working with these 
organizations.

Naud, 
environmental 
coordinator for Ann Arbor, has worked 
on projects with Public Policy students 
before. One of the projects involved

City Council 
tables discussion 
of controversial 
new zoning

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

 
The Ann Arbor City Council 
has tabled a discussion regarding 
potential zoning code changes 
to 
University 
of 
Michigan 
fraternities and sororities until 
June, hoping to work out details 
in the legislation before a vote. 
The 
zoning 
code 
changes, 
which have caused tension with 
U-M Greek life members and 
lawyers, would require future 
fraternities and sororities to 
maintain an affiliation with the 
University or another academic 
body to acquire a city permit. 
Under the proposed changes, 
if a sorority or fraternity loses 
University recognition in the 
future, it can apply for a two-
year special exception before it 
would lose its house.
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, wrote 
in an email interview that the 
zoning code changes entered 
discussion 
after 
numerous 
complaints from neighbors of 
fraternity and sorority houses 
and a recommendation from the 
Planning Commission.

“The 
City’s 
Planning 
Commission 
(a 
body 
of 
volunteer 
experts 
in 
real 
estate, 
architecture, 
and 
sustainability) first took this 
up in response to neighborhood 
concerns,” 
Ackerman 
wrote. 
“Many neighbors of Fraternities 
and 
Sororities 
(more 
often 
Fraternities), have has serious 
issues, which our current Noise, 
Litter, and Nuisance regulations 
cannot 
effectively 
control. 
These existing regulations only 
punish the student tenants, not 
the property owners. By using 
zoning code, the City is better 
aligning the priorities of the 
property owner with the needs 
of the community. For example, 
a landlord may not care if 25 
of their tenants received noise 
complaint tickets. However, that 
same landlord probably cares 
about paying off their mortgage, 
which higher tenant capacity 
allows him to do more quickly. 
Our goal is to get the landlord 
more 
engaged 
in 
problem 
properties and tenants because 
they now have a financial stake 
in their behavior.”
Ackerman 
also 
said 
the 
ordinance would set a cap on 
the number of people allowed 
to live in a fraternity or sorority 
house.

Twenty-six Wolverines 

named Fulbright Finalists

Program funds 
international 
engagement

By ROB DALKA

For The Daily 

The University of Michigan 

boasts 19 students and seven alum-

ni as finalists for the 2018-2019 Ful-

bright Student Program.

The Fulbright program was 

introduced in 1945 when Sen. J. 

William Fulbright presented a 

congressional bill that encouraged 

student engagement in the inter-

national community. The program 

currently offers research, study 

and teaching opportunities in more 

than 140 countries to U.S. citizens 

who complete their undergradu-

ate degree before the grant date. 

The recipients of the grant include 

young professionals that hold or 

are pursuing bachelor’s, master’s 

or doctorate degrees.

The University’s International 

Institute hires Fulbright program 

advisers to help students navi-

gate the application process. The 

advisers hold information sessions 

throughout the year and help stu-

dents make their applications com-

pelling and competitive.

Among the announced final-

ists, 13 U-M students were offered 

English Teaching Assistantships 

through the Fulbright program. 

ETA recipients assist local English 

teachers in classrooms around the 

world, including Bulgaria, China, 

Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Slo-

vak Republic, Spain, Taiwan and 

Turkey.

Eleven students and recent 

graduates were offered the Ful-

bright 
Study-Research 
Award, 

which allows recipients to work on 

research projects at foreign univer-

sities.

Eric Peterson, a recent LSA 

graduate, is one of the named final-

ists for this award. As an under-

graduate, 
Peterson 
researched 

Rydberg atoms in professor Georg 

Raithel’s atomic physics labora-

tory. Last summer, Peterson par-

ticipated in a two-month research 

project at a French university 

through a National Science Foun-

dation grant.

Peterson credited his experi-

ence in France for his interest in 

working with people from differ-

ent countries.

“Science is really an interna-

tional effort, whether that be 

through 
large 
collaborations 

or just through the sharing of 

knowledge, and I think my expe-

rience in France opened my eyes 

to this,” Peterson said.

Under the Fulbright Study/

Research Award, Peterson will be 

working at the ELI-NP research 

facility in Romania, studying 

interactions between high-ener-

gy laser pulses and solid material.

Two other individuals will be 

participating in unique Fulbright 

programs. Laura Lapidus, a recent 

Music, Theatre & Dance gradu-

ate, has been named the final-

ist for the John Wood LAMBDA 

Award in Classical Acting. Each 

year, the award gives one finalist 

the opportunity to pursue a one-

year master’s degree in classical 

acting at the London Academy of 

Music & Dramatic Art.

Another finalist, recent LSA 

graduate Merin McDivitt, was 

accepted 
into 
the 
Binational 

Internship Program in Mexico. 

The program allows fellows to 

intern at a Mexican company or 

organization while taking classes 

at a local university. McDivitt is 

looking forward to working and 

studying in Mexico City.

“I’m so excited to live in Mexi-

co City!” McDivitt said. “I visited 

the city recently and fell in love 

with it — it has more museums 

than any other city in the world 

and is home to literally thousands 

of unique communities, a stun-

ning national park and dozens of 

layers of ancient and modern his-

tory.”

McDivitt 
is 
interested 
in 

sustainable tourism and heri-

tage-based businesses in Latin 

America and hopes that she will 

learn a lot during her experience.

“I hope to gain a much deeper 

understanding of Mexican cul-

ture, particularly the business 

and arts environments.” McDivitt 

said. “Mexico has a rich, impres-

sive tradition of regional artisan 

wares that I can’t wait to explore 

and see how I can collaborate on 

future projects that raise aware-

ness of Mexican heritage.”

When reached for comment, 

the University spokesperson Kim 

Broekhuizen said, “It is always 

great to see our students recog-

nized.”

City election 2018:A breakdown of Ann 

Arbor’s mayoral and council candidates

City primary election 
will be hosted Aug. 7

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor 

The Ann Arbor City Council will 
hold a primary election for mayor 
and five council positions Aug. 7. 
Here is a breakdown of this year’s 
candidates:
Mayoral Candidates:
Incumbent Mayor Christopher 
Taylor will seek reelection against 
Council 
Member 
Jack 
Eaton, 
D-Ward 4.
Taylor admits he’s proud of the 
progress made during his first term 
but feels his work isn’t over.
“Although I feel we have done 
a lot of great work in Ann Arbor, 
there’s still a great deal more to do,” 
Taylor said. “Obviously, we have to 
work to fix our roads; our (storm) 
water infrastructure is aging. Also, 
it’s important that we make Ann 
Arbor the most equitable and sus-
tainable place you’ve ever lived. We 
need to fund and commit to afford-
able housing and implement our 
climate action plan.”
Yet the mayor’s first term hasn’t 
been all roses. After the city voted 
May 2 to repurchase the Y lot from 
local real estate developer Dennis 
Dahlmann for $4.2 million, Coun-
cilmember Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2, 
criticized Taylor for a statement he 
made in which he lamented how 
supporters of the vote cost the city 
“thousands, if not millions, of dol-
lars.”
“The statement is plainly and 
obviously temperate and not a per-
sonal attack,” Taylor said. “It is in 
my view, plainly and obviously fac-
tual: The fact that my colleagues 
made a very poor decision on April 
2 and, in my view, contrary to the 
city interests. I can understand 
why people don’t want to hear that, 
but it was not said with personal-
ity. It did not get to the motive. It 
just got to the effect of the decision. 
That’s public discourse.”
Eaton, on the other hand, attrib-
uted his candidacy to the fact that 
he felt the city was not addressing 
many issues in the way that he pre-
ferred.
“There are a number of issues 
that are very important to me that I 
just feel that we’re not taking a lead 
on,” Eaton said. “I think that I can 
provide leadership on the really 
important issues facing the city.”

Eaton has served on City Council 
since 2013 and specified the issues 
he hopes to improve include infra-
structure, public safety, affordable 
housing and the environment.
One 
environmental 
concern 
Eaton addressed was the 1,4-Diox-
ane plume that contaminates Ann 
Arbor groundwater.
Dioxane is a carcinogenic com-
pound that was widely used for 
manufacturing in the past. Ann 
Arbor manufacturer Gelman Sci-
ences, now Pall Corp., released the 
chemical as an industrial byprod-
uct into an unlined lagoon from 
1966 to 1986. The main concern is 
the plume will reach the Huron 
River and contaminate Barton 
Pond, Ann Arbor’s main source for 
drinking water.
“I would like to join the petition 
that other communities in the area 
have filed with the EPA asking the 
EPA to take a more active role in 
the oversight of the progress of the 
plume,” Eaton said. “I’m embar-
rassed that a city like Ann Arbor 
with a strong reputation for envi-
ronmentalism isn’t more active and 
seeking an actual remedy.”
Yet some critics and council-
members have complained about 
Eaton previously accepting dona-
tions from Dahlmann, the local 
real estate developer who pur-
chased the “Y lot” from the city in 
a failed promise to develop afford-
able 
housing 
and 
commercial 
developing.
“All council members receive 
contributions from people who 
later have business in front of coun-
cil and the efforts to disparage me 
for having received the contribu-
tions from Dennis Dahlmann are 
purely political,” Eaton responded.
Ward 1:
Councilmember Sumi Kailasap-
athy, D-Ward 1, will not be seeking 
reelection. Democrats Ron Gin-
yard and Jeff Hayner are running 
to fill her position.
Hayner sees major concerns 
with the city’s natural resources 
and environmental concerns, spe-
cifically within his ward.
“Especially in Ward 1 where 
I’m running, we have a lot of land-
use issues here on the north side,” 
Hayner said. “We’re the river 
part of the city primarily. We had 
the most vacant land, township 
(island) and agriculture land left 
over.”

Ward 2:
Councilmember Kirk Westphal 
is seeking reelection for Ward 2 
against challenger Kathy Griswold.
Westphal feels the main issues 
the city faces include public safety, 
affordable housing and infrastruc-
ture.
Westphal thinks continued Uni-
versity and city cooperation will 
help address the recent string of 
home invasions and sexual assaults 
near the University.
“I think I speak for all of Council 
when I say we will get resources that 
our police ask for to the extent we 
can within our budget,” Westphal 
said. “I think sexual assault is a com-
plex problem that needs focus and 
cooperation between the city and 
the University to look at the sources 
of the problem and ensure we con-
tinue coordinating and communi-
cating with each other to go after 
what’s driving this latest uptick in 
these assaults.”
Ward 3:
Ward 3 will see a competition 
between 
Councilmember 
Julie 
Grand and Alice Liberson.
Grand claims city affordability 
and public safety are major issues 
in Ann Arbor. As a pre-health aca-
demic adviser in LSA, Grand said 
students often bring up concerns 
with city affordability in advising 
appointments.
“I hear a lot from students on their 
struggles to find housing,” Grand 
said. “If the University is thinking 
about DEI initiatives and bringing 
in students from a range of income 
groups and increasing the number 
of transfer students, I really am con-
cerned about affordable housing.”
Liberson was not available for 
comment in time for publication.
Ward 4:
For Ward 4, Councilmember 
Graydon Krapohl is running for 
reelection against Elizabeth Nel-
son.
Nelson works as a substitute 
teacher for Washtenaw County 
and has been an Ann Arbor resi-
dent since 2004. Her inspiration 
for running for City Council 
came after her realization that 
she does not have to be a spe-
cific type of person to run for a 
council seat.

W

omen 
have 
faced 
inequality for as long 
as we have had written 
history – especially when it comes to 
female athletes. Today, players on the 
U.S. Women’s Soccer Team – the No. 
1 women’s soccer team in the world 
– get paid “as little as 40%” of those 
on the U.S. Men’s Soccer Team. The 
pay gap between male and female 
athletes is glaringly obvious and 
largely unjustified. In fact, it is often 
overwhelming.
Furthermore, there is little to 
no representation of women on 
the governing bodies of sports 
organizations and previous attempts 
to 
achieve 
this 
representation 
have failed. In fact, only 18 percent 
of board members were women 
across the 28 international sports 
federations, and this percentage 
has been static from 2014 to 2016. 
If women can’t even get onto the 
boards of these organizations, how 
can we expect any change?
Even the executives at FIFA admit 
we shouldn’t be holding our breath 
for equality; a former FIFA secretary 
general for the organization stated 
it might be “another 23 World Cups 
before potentially women should 
receive the same amount (of prize 
money) as men.” This pay gap will 
not close, and if it does, it will do so 
very slowly. This means another 
100 years until female athletes can 
expect to be treated as equals to their 
male counterparts. It asks women to 
wait 100 more years to receive equal 
compensation when they often have 
to outperform men by a huge margin 
just to gain any kind of respect. If 

these organizations continue to 
remain ignorant of this pressing 
issue and fail to address it, female 
athletes will never be able to close the 
pay gap. Action needs to begin at the 
top, and that means acknowledging 
the issue, allowing women to speak 
about it and implementing real policy 
change.
At all levels of sport, male athletes 
are held in a higher regard than 
female athletes. Because of this, 
it becomes much more difficult to 
achieve equality. Speaking from 
personal experience, I can say the 
men’s teams always get priority. 
In high school, they got the most 
qualified coaches, the earlier practice 
time and more money to pay for gear. 
The athletic director of the school 
advertised men’s games and not 
women’s games. Our administrators 
and teachers showed up to the men’s 
games and not the women’s games. 
As a result, students followed suit.
In 
collegiate 
athletics, 
this 
systematic inequity is most easily 
seen in ticket prices. This study 
shows men’s teams are thought to 
be better simply because tickets 
to their games cost more due to 
the assumption that the price of a 
product reflects its value. This issue 
can be costly in terms of public 
perception of women’s sports. The 
public needs to understand female 
athletes are just as valuable as male 
athletes, but different ticket pricing 
perpetuates the public’s perception 
that men’s sports are more valuable. 
At the University of Michigan, 
season tickets for men’s basketball 
cost $175; season tickets for women’s 

basketball cost $45. Both teams were 
ranked in the top 25 throughout the 
season, both teams made the NCAA 
tournament, both teams play in the 
Big Ten and both teams play at Crisler 
Center. Despite the similarities 
in merit, location and schedule, 
the women’s team had an average 
attendance of 2,672 people per game 
while the men’s team had an average 
attendance of 11,121 people per game. 
The public, a.k.a. the consumers, 
need to know female athletics are 
just as important as male athletics. 
Without this understanding, the 
sports world will continue to justify 
the pay gap and other inequalities.
College athletes, both male and 
female, put in a lot of time playing 
their sport. It is disappointing to 
know despite equal amounts of 
hours of work, one team is valued 
more by the University and therefore 
its students. It is important that 
inequality is stopped in its early 
stages, and perhaps the University 
can set an example for other colleges 
and universities around the nation 
by starting to level the playing field 
for our young female athletes. They 
work just as hard and are just as 
talented; in fact, Katelynn Flaherty

Careening Towards Uncertainty
L

ast Tuesday afternoon 
marked the beginning 
of 
a 
new 
chapter 
for 
America’s 
Middle 
East 
policy. Ahead of the official 
May 12th deadline, President 
Trump announced his refusal 
to recertify sanctions relief 
for Iran, thereby 
withdrawing 
the 
U.S. 
from 
the 
landmark 
2015 
Iran nuclear deal.
By no measure 
was 
the 
Iran 
nuclear 
deal, 
known 
officially 
as 
the 
Joint 
Comprehensive 
Plan 
of 
Action, 
JCPOA, 
perfect. 
Certain 
aspects 
and 
provisions 
of the deal have 
no doubt proved 
contrary to the interests of 
Israel and the U.S. However, 
Trump’s 
dismissal 
of 
the 
deal 
without 
an 
apparent 
replacement 
or 
follow-up 
plan, 
in 
keeping 
with 
his 
characteristically shortsighted 
style, leaves America’s policy 
towards Iran in a troubling 
state of uncertainty.
The deal, although derided as 
a temporary fix to a permanent 
problem, 
addressed 
several 
components of Iran’s budding 
nuclear program which was 
ostensibly for energy purposes 
only but was agreed upon to 
be military in nature by the 
international 
community. 
All of these comprehensive 
limitations 
were 
enforced 
through mandatory inspections 
by the United Nations’ nuclear 
arm, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, IAEA. 
In exchange for hobbling 
its 
nuclear 
abilities, 
Iran 
would 
be 
relieved 
of 
the 
crippling economic sanctions 
that had followed its nuclear 
development since 2006, which 
had cost it hundreds of billions 
of dollars by isolating it from 
global financial markets and 
limiting its oil exports. The 
provisions of the deal, laid out 
in ten and 15-year segments, 
allowed 
for 
longer-term 
arrangements to be made in the 
interim, which could address 
the larger issue of Iranian 
nuclear capability.
The 
lack 
of 
permanence 
within 
the 
deal 
was 
only 

natural, 
as 
Iran’s 
extant 
nuclear knowledge can never 
be destroyed, nor can it legally 
be denied the right to carry out 
nuclear activity for peaceful 
means. Iran’s regime clearly 
deemed 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
beneficial 
to its foreign 
policy 
goals 
before 
the 
deal, and the 
JCPOA 
did 
what it could 
by successfully 
presenting 
sanctions relief 
as a worthwhile 
tradeoff 
in 
the 
short-
term. Where 
the 
JCPOA 
most 
notably 
faltered, 
however, 
was in the lack of concern it 
demonstrated regarding Israel. 
 
As Iran has collected the 
windfalls 
of 
the 
JCPOA’s 
sanctions relief, it has spent 
billions 
to 
arm 
Hezbollah 
and other Shiite militias in 
Lebanon and Syria, as has 
been adamantly expressed by 
Israel. The use of sanctions 
relief by Tehran to fund proxy 
wars against Israeli interests 
has 
led 
to 
unprecedented 
levels of conflict in the region, 
weakening ties between the 
U.S. and our strongest Middle 
Eastern ally.
Trump’s 
decision 
to 
withdraw 
from 
the 
deal, 
however, was most likely not 
the result of a comprehensive 
and balanced assessment. Since 
his 
presidential 
campaign, 
Trump has maintained the 
deal’s nefarious one-sidedness. 
Additionally, withdrawal from 
the JCPOA is consistent with 
Trump’s 
persistent 
hostility 
towards both Obama’s legacy 
and multilateral deals that 
have taken the place of a more 
traditional emphasis on policy.
The 
long-term 
ambitions 
present in the U.S. withdrawal 
are, instead, represented by 
national-security 
advisor 
John Bolton and Secretary of 
State Mike Pompeo. Bolton’s 
hawkish propensity for regime

’ll have a second helping of that 
wonderful fish you got there, 
Miss Julia.” A man who claims 
to be named William Shakespeare 
addresses me with familiarity. He’s 
a regular at Food Gatherers on West 
Huron Street, as are many locals 
who volunteer their time and serve 
dinner to those who can’t find it 
elsewhere. “You know I’m from the 
Caribbean. This meal tastes like 
home to me.”
As I scoop a little extra fish onto 
the plate of rice and beans I’ve 
already made for William, I think 
about how this meal not only carries 
him back to his roots in Jamaica but 
also nourishes him and relieves some 
of the pressure that homelessness 
places on his shoulders.
Homeless and poverty-stricken 
individuals face food insecurity, or 
simply put, the lack of access to food. 
In an interview, Rackham student 
Vivienne Hazzard, who is pursuing 
a 
doctorate 
degree 
in 
public 
health, explains, “food insecurity 
is linked to lower diet quality,” 
and is associated with “a variety of 
adverse health outcomes, including 
cardiovascular disease, Type 2 
diabetes and cancer.” This link may 
not seem novel; most of us have seen 
or heard about “Super Size Me”, 
the documentary about a man who 
eats nothing but McDonald’s for a 
month and ends up with all sorts 
of poor health conditions. What 
may seem surprising, however, is 
the sheer volume of food-insecure 
adults, seniors and children that 
walk 
through 
Food 
Gatherers’ 
doors, most of whom need a meal 
on a daily basis. Each dinner, Food 
Gatherers goes through countless 
vats of mashed potatoes or multiple 
sheets of peanut butter cake. Last 
week, we exhausted a 5-gallon 
container of strawberries halfway 
through dinner.“Food insecurity 
is much more prevalent than we 
usually think,” Cindy Leung, an 
assistant professor of nutritional 
sciences, said in an interview with 
me. 
Leung 
researches 
dietary 
and 
health 
disparities 
among 
certain populations that are more 
vulnerable than others. She explains 
even those above the poverty line 
may have a hard time accessing 
a sufficient amount of food, thus 
exposing more Americans to hunger 
than to poverty.
“Food insecurity can be as 
simple as worrying about your food 
running out before you have money 
to buy more or not being able to eat a 
balanced meal, and as severe as not 

eating for a whole day because you 
don’t have money for food,” Leung 
said.
Our 
campus 
lies 
within 
Washtenaw 
County, 
an 
area 
with food insecurity rates at 13.6 
percent, higher than the national 
average at 12.3 percent. About 
48,750 individuals, or 13.6 percent 
of our county, report facing food 
insecurity. They make up the 
William Shakespeares, the faces to 
the stomachs that are fed regularly 
on West Huron. Emergency food 
programs 
like 
Food 
Gatherers 
regularly see many of these people. 
In a 2009 report, 85 percent of 

those served at Food Gatherers 
have monthly incomes less than 
$500, 35 percent say a food kitchen 
is their only or primary source of 
food, and only 13 percent eat the 
recommended servings of fruits and 
vegetables. What’s preventing them 
from eating more smoothies and 
fresh veggies, you ask? About three 
quarters of recipients say the main 
obstacle is high costs.
Leung has started challenging 
the assumption that food insecurity 
only affects adults by studying the 
effects of poor access to food in 
college students. In 2015, a doctoral 
student in her department found 
that 41.5 percent of University of 
Michigan 
students 
experienced 
food insecurity at some point 
that year. “The administration is 
starting to work on strategies to 
address this, but it will take a long 
time to understand all the factors 
that contribute to student food 
insecurity and how universities 
should best address food security 
and other basic needs security 
among students.” 
This research is essential because 
good nutrition is also extremely 
important 
in 
fighting 
diseases. 
Millions of studies have been 

published nationwide that show 
the negative effects of a poor diet 
on health. Foods with high fat and 
sugar content are often cheaper 
than nutritious proteins, fruits and 
vegetables, forcing too much of our 
population to resort to something 
unhealthier, like that mysterious 
fast-food 
chicken. 
Because 
Washtenaw has the highest cost of 
living in the state, we can see how 
an inexpensive, low-quality diet is 
often the only option.
How do we put an end to this 
cycle? Leung says, “Food Gatherers 
and other anti-hunger programs 
are vital in helping to alleviate 
food 
insecurity 
in 
vulnerable 
populations, 
but 
unfortunately, 
they are not the be-all and end-all 
solution.” She explains that we need 
to tackle the roots of food insecurity. 
Emergency food programs are used 
at consistently high rates because 
food insecurity continues to persist. 
In Washtenaw, almost half of 
community kitchen users reported 
being “worse off” than they were 
only a year ago. On the bright side, 
with the knowledge that food 
insecurity is related to lower diet 
quality, programs are taking steps 
in the right direction by adopting 
nutrition standards for foods they 
distribute. Food insecurity isn’t just 
a hunger issue; it’s a nutrition issue. 
Food banks should play a role in 
distributing foods of high quality, 
not just high quantity.
Can 
Food 
Gatherers 
meet 
the increased demand for their 
services? Even with the 6.5 million 
pounds of food served in 2017, Food 
Gatherers President Eileen Spring is 
worried many more locals may soon 
struggle to find their next meal. 
This is because of the imminent 
U.S. House of Representative vote 
on the Farm Bill; if passed, it would 
involve huge cuts to SNAP, the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program. You might know SNAP 
by its benefits, which were formerly 
called food stamps. This hunger 
safety net is the largest of its kind 
in the United States and offers 
food assistance to nearly 42 million 
low-income 
individuals. 
The 
Michigan branch of SNAP works 
with neighborhood organizations 
to ensure its nutritional-assistance 
benefits reach all who are eligible. 
If we want our community to 
improve and reach its potential, 
we must do all we can to ensure 
the Farm Bill is not passed. We can 
take action by urging our U.S. Rep.

in hostile states, along 
with Pompeo’s prioritization 
of curbing Iranian regional 
military 
expeditions, 
granted the two a boon in 
Tuesday’s 
nixing 
of 
the 
JCPOA, while only serving 
to worry other signatories to 
the deal. 
These ambitions are left 
empty without immediate 
action to take the place of 
the JCPOA, which Trump 
has failed to put forward or 
even outline. It must be kept 
in mind that the urgency of 
the JCPOA originated from 
Iran’s supposed proximity to 
full nuclear capability, and 
the same should be kept in 
mind for the regime now that 
it will soon be unbounded by 
the deal’s limitations. But, 
tighter sanctions may not 
be enough to force Iran back 
to make a more conciliatory 
deal before it reaches that 
capability.
To begin with, Iran has 
reacted 
towards 
Trump’s 
decision by maintaining that 
the U.S. was bound to break 
its word from the beginning. 
In addition to the general 
tradition of distrust towards 
the U.S. that this inspires 
– namely in regards to the 
upcoming meeting between 
North Korea and the U.S. 
over 
Pyongyang’s 
own 
nuclear arsenal – it forces 
Iran into a corner regarding 
future deals with the U.S., at 
the risk of being portrayed 
as spineless to the Iranian 
people. 
This shortcoming could 
perhaps be overcome, if not 
for the lack of steps that 
have been taken thus far 
to remedy it. Namely, the 
issue of forcing the deal’s 
other signatories to comply 
with a return to secondary 
sanctions places the U.S. at 

risk of clashing head-on with 
the European countries that 
originally helped broker the 
deal. 
Although, in the end, the 
European signatories will 
most likely side with the U.S., 
the case carries the danger 
of blowing up and damaging 
key alliances. The hesitation 
this will likely cause could 
prove lethal as Iran returns 
to a limitless nuclear arena.
Ultimately, 
Trump’s 
refusal to compose anything 
close to a comprehensive 
Middle East policy has been 
adequately reflected in his 
abrupt withdrawal from the 
Iran nuclear deal. As the 
country has seen, Trump’s 
brash “America First” calls 
for 
reduced 
international 
presence on his campaign 
have often been relegated 
to 
distant 
memories 
the 
moment they are confronted 
by 
more 
uncomfortable 
realities, as has been the case 
in Syria and Afghanistan. 
As 
of 
now, 
Iran 
will 
prove no different. The 
result 
of 
withdrawal, 
beyond 
the 
probable 
resumption 
of 
Iranian 
nuclear 
activity, 
will 
be 
boosted Iranian confidence 
in the absence of American 
coherence. Without a plan 
to 
realistically 
reinstate 
sanctions to positive effect 
by ensuring the unwavering 
cooperation 
of 
all 
other 
signatories, the U.S. is left 
with nowhere to turn to 
after the nuclear deal. The 
deal as it stood may have 
instated its own problems, 
but until further action, the 
U.S. is surely worse off than 
it was before.

CANNES INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL

Cannes: ‘Leto’

Cannes: ‘Sorry Angel’ 
delves into the heart

FESTIVAL COVERAGE

I should have taken French 
in school. I opted for Spanish, 
as responsible kids often do in 
California, for it promised to be 
more useful. However, I now find 
myself in the south of France — 
having miraculously schemed 
my way into the 71st Cannes Film 
Festival — knowing very little 
Spanish and even less French. 
I’ve gotten by with “bonjour” 
and “merci” as I continue to mar-
vel at the beauty of the language 
that makes absolutely everything 
sound wonderful, and wish that I 
had been a little less responsible. 
I try to sound out the name of the 
movie that I stand in the queue 
for, “Plaire Aimer et Courir 
Vite,” but it comes out all wrong. 
The American title is “Sorry 
Angel,” two short words that 
don’t seem right at all, and I feel 
as though I’m Bill Murray hold-
ing Japanese whiskey in “Lost in 
Translation.”
“Plaire Aimer et Courir Vite” 
literally translates to “Pleasure, 
Love, and Run Fast,” which 
serves as a much more astute title 
than the translation it is given. 
The moody romantic drama 
from 
writer-director 
Chris-
tophe Honoré (“Metamorpho-
ses”) fallows a gay novelist and 
playwright in 1990s Paris named 

Jacques (Pierre Deladonchamps, 
“Stranger by the Lake”) as he 
meets and falls for Arthur (Vin-
cent Lacoste, “The French Kiss-
ers”), an adventurous student 
who, like most, is still figuring 
things out. Arthur likes to read 

and knows little about authors, 
which is pathetically normal 
for kids who have grand ideas 
about the world but know little 
of what it actually is. Jacques is 
more seasoned, falls into a deep 
depression and can’t seem to put 
to rest the failed loves that dis-
appear only to reappear again. 
Jacques, ultimately, may have 
never loved at all.
“Plaire Aimer et Courir Vite” 
is one of those romantic trag-

edies that is sad in all the right 
ways. 
The 
cinematography 
paints France in blues, deepen-
ing the loneliness of the two lov-
ers stuck in their self-destructive 
orbits and running out of time. 
Rather than making a grandiose 
political statement on gay rights, 
AIDS or a number of other 
themes that the film alludes to, 
“Sorry Angel” is more concerned 
with matters of the soul. Love, 
or at least Honoré’s depiction of 
love, is painful. It hurts. It hurts 
when it is not returned, when it 
doesn’t appear like one hopes, 
and when there just doesn’t seem 
to be enough of it. Love hurts 
when it’s perfect, too.
And for all the heartache 
that “Sorry Angel” so master-
fully creates through Jacques’s 
and Arthur’s own heartache, 
there are moments of pure, cin-
ematic joy that erupt on screen. 
A flirty meet-cute in a movie 
theater, a brainy telephone call 
full of witty banter, a drunken 
living room dance party — ele-
ments that every good romance 
needs, yet few actually master. 
Jacques’s and Arthur’s rela-
tionship is three-dimensional: 
Their interest in each other, in 
the worlds that the characters 
inhabit, both together and apart, 
makes sense. And that is what 
makes this French Cannes selec-
tion so moving, heartbreaking 
and wonderful to witness.

The requiem for the local scene 
— the underground scene, the house 
show scene, the “we’ll never be 
big, that’s okay we just want to be” 
scene — is the greatest kind of music 
movie. To perfectly encapsulate how 
a specific moment in a specific place 
looked and sounded is one thing. 
To recreate its feeling is another 
ambition altogether. Russian film-
maker Krill Serebrennikov’s latest 
film “Leto” does both with a skill 
and joyfulness unmatched in recent 
memory.
The film follows Mike (Alexandr 
Gorchilin), the central and center-
ing figure for the roiling Leningrad 
underground rock scene of the 
1980s. He’s cool, calculatedly distant 
in aviator sunglasses and exudes a 
level of carelessness that cannot be 
matched by the stiff crowd of youths 
at the rock club he and his band 
frequent. Their every foot tap and 
head nod are policed by rule-loving 
adults.
Mike and his crew, including his 
wife Natasha (Irina Starshenbaum), 
amble through the woods sing-
ing about summer. That’s where 
they find Viktor (Teo Yoo) and pull 
him into their circle and really set 
the plot in motion. They dance and 
drink and play guitar. Jump over fire 
and run naked through the water. 
They are young and free.
But “Leto” doesn’t let its audi-
ence believe for very long that these 
are the youngest or the freest or the 
most counter-cultural youth in the 
world. Their exuberance is matched 
by self- and state-sponsored censor-
ship. Unlike its relatives in the music 
movie genre, “Leto” doesn’t look 
wistfully at a time when anything 
was possible, it vividly recreates a 

moment when people did as much 
as they could, as much as they let 
themselves do. That seems to be the 
greatest hindrance to Mike’s rise to 
the top: His inability to let himself 
rebel or succeed fully. That, and his 
proximity to Viktor’s superior tal-
ent, are crippling.
But even for the rest of his crew — 
who aren’t impeded by success, their 
main collaborator and rival — Len-
ingrad has slow suffocating effect. 
Serebrennikov navigates beautifully 
the divide between the intimacy and 
secrecy of their scene and the loud 
rebellion its existence demands. 
Early on in the film, during a train 
altercation, a new character looks 
into the camera and tells the audi-
ence they are about to hear a song 
by “Soviet enemies” The Talking 
Heads. And thus our heroes are off, 
running and jumping and punching 
their way through a heavily accent-
ed, thoroughly charming cover of 
“Psycho Killer.”
In these musical interludes (as 
well as other bursts that are quickly 
noted to be ahistorical) we see these 
kids become the clashing, crashing, 
joyously angry punks their world 
does not let them be. This tension 
— between the narrative and the 
interludes — is where the film finds 
a great deal of its success and proves 
an unexpectedly apt way to navigate 
the disparity between a free mind 
and a policed body. “Leto” has all 
the whispering intimacy of “Inside 
Llewyn Davis” and the joyful noise 
of “Sing Street.”
“Leto” is a standout of its genre 
not for its musical quality or mastery 
of rambling narrative (although both 
are truly exceptional), but for the 
way in which it provides a space for 
a deeply intimate portrait of musical 
moment and an exuberate depiction 
of youth culture to coexist.

The watch list for any academic 
film course almost always rounds 
out to something like: a Chaplain 
comedy, some Technicolor musical, 
four impenetrable foreign films, 
two other silent-era juggernauts 
and Citizen Kane. Which is fine 
— in order to begin to form an 
understanding of how cinema has 
developed and grown and evolved 
in the past hundred years, it’s 
absolutely necessary to revisit the 
timeless classics time and time 
again.
Now, without disputing the 
all too well-deserved status of 
something like “Le Voyage dans la 
Lune” or “City of Lights,” there’s a 
simple question to be asked: How 
beneficial is it to force yourself to 
enjoy something just because of 
the cultural weight it holds? It’s 
essentially an a question of pleasure 
versus purpose; when I sit down to 
read a book, do I try to wade my way 
through Tolstoy, or do I reread “The 
Lightning Thief”? How great can 
something truly be if the process of 
experiencing it isn’t?
In my own personal experience, 
I’ve found plenty of both. I’ve 
sat down to watch classic films 
that I end up loving as truly great 
entertainment, and I’ve stood up 
from watching certain undisputed 
classics to find that the only thing I 
watched in the previous two hours 
was the same two gifs on the front 
page of Reddit. It’s difficult because 
as someone who likes to believe 
they are fan of cinema, to walk away 
from something like “Tokyo Story” 
feeling like I could have dozed off is 
disappointing — more for me than 
for the movie itself.
Which brings us to the French 
New Wave.

I wanted personally to challenge 
myself with learning more about 
cinema’s past, and everywhere 
I looked pointed to this seven to 
eight year period beginning in the 
late 1950s. It’s probably the most 
paradigm shifting movement in 
cinema in the past seventy years. 
It’s probably an era that would 
be mentioned by any accolade-
encumbered director were they 
to be asked about influence and 
produced a great swath of truly 
entertaining pieces of work that 
will burn the whole point of writing 
this column to the ground. 
Along with my decades-late 
judgment for a slate of undisputed 
classics, I hope to provide enough 
historical context for the films so 
that I can fully understand the 
implications of the movement. 
While the main point of this series 
is to look back on these films with 
a modern eye, learning about their 
place in the history of the art form 
is just as important. It’ll be my first 
time viewing most of these films 
as well. Putting it all together, my 
goal by the end is to have created 
something that is as readable as it is 
informative. A lot of the resources 
related to the topic already written 
online read like textbooks, so let’s 
hope this never reaches that.
In order to best understand the 
impetus for such a significant shift 
in the world of cinema, I found a 
good starting point in Alexandre 
Astruc’s 1948 essay “The Birth of 
a New Avante-Garde: La Camera-
Stylo,” an almost prophetic essay 
published ten years before the 
New Wave exploded onto the 
international stage. In his essay, 
Astruc writes about the “tired 
and conventional everyday films” 
which “put our sensibilities in 
danger of being blunted,” a rather 
irate comment on the rote and 

predictable nature of early post-war 
cinema. Largely, this comes from, as 
Francois Truffaut would later write, 
cinema’s plague of underestimate; 
the majority of studio productions 
going to market at that time were 
reproductions or recreations of 
stories already told in some other 
medium, mainly literature and 
theater. It wasn’t until the New 
Wave that cinema began to develop 
its own language as an art form, 
Astruc even writing in his essay 
that “from this day onward it will 
be possible for cinema to produce 
works which are equivalent in 
their profundity to the works of 
Faulkner and Malraux.” It was the 
New Wave that first transformed 
cinema from “nothing more than 
a show” (Astruc) that sold tickets 
and filled auditoriums to an artistic 
medium capable of competing with 
the best. Astruc called this new 
era of cinema the age of “Camera-
Stylo” (or Camera-Pen) in reference 
to the authorship filmmakers were 
beginning to take over their pieces 
of work. Film would no longer be a 
second thought.
It’s difficult to point exactly to 
the first film of the movement, as the 
“French New Wave” designation 
was created retrospectively. After 
a bit of research, I found that 
a good place to start is Claude 
Chabrol’s 1958 film “Le Beau 
Serge” (“Handsome Serge”), as it 
is the first of the major films by the 
New Wave’s six major directors. 
“Serge” is the story of a successful 
Frenchman, Francois, returning to 
the town of his youth and reuniting 
with his childhood best friend 
Serge, a burned-out drunk who 
never left.

Tranquility 
Base 
Hotel 
& 
Casino is nothing like anything 
Arctic Monkeys has done before. 
It is, however, like things other 
bands have done. It’s particularly 
impossible not to be reminded of 
David Bowie and Ziggy Stardust in 
the face of this concept album, full of 
science fiction, rockstars and droopy, 
whispering vocals. Early in a first 
listen, it’s easy to wonder whether 
Arctic Monkeys are trying to pick up 
a mantle that most modern musical 
culture has already abandoned.
Luckily, the album proves to be 
a feat of its own, coming into itself 
with an array of darkly whimsical 
space rock. “Golden Trunks” is 
pleasantly choral, and the layered 
but catchy pop of “Four Out Of Five” 
is only bolstered by 
creative images like 
“special effects of 
my mind’s eye.” The 
lyrics 
album-wide, 
while 
generally 
strong, aren’t quite as 
consistently airtight 
as they have been 
on some of Alex Turner’s previous 
work, but they do play a crucial role 
both in creating some of the album’s 
central confusions and in helping to 
untangle that web later on.
The 
pesky 
question 
of 
genuineness also bubbles up a few 
more times throughout the album’s 
11-track span: After all, the band isn’t 
quite old enough yet to be washed-
out and mopey, but in many of the 
songs here, they are anyway. But 
one has to give the layers of the 
music due credit, and between the 
sweeping, hypnotic backgrounds 
and loungey vocals, there is a 
genuine message here that promises 
that Arctic Monkeys is nowhere near 
done being edgy, creative and above 
all — exploratory.
One of the things that Tranquility 
Base does right is that it grounds 
itself as a concept album and as a 
work of science fiction, it completely 
hits the mark. The album is colored 
with the aloof skepticism that, 
beneath the surface, characterizes 
science fiction as a genre. It’s a lush 
dive into imagination coupled with 
an on-guard wariness of the future.
The album also makes good 
use of its chosen vantage point: A 

hotel and casino on the moon. The 
setting of outer space invites a range 
of perspectives, from the inward 
to the literally astronomical, and 
in the midst of a dreamy, druggy 
environment — a fitting canvas 
for space — Arctic Monkeys make 
an effort to explore them all. 
Sometimes this is to a fault — songs 
like the dread-infused “She Looks 
Like Fun” teeter on the verge of 
being muddled and directionless, 
and “One Point Perspective” is so 
incomprehensible that even the 
narrator himself admits, “Bear 
with me, man, I’ve lost my train 
of thought,” by the end. However, 
this same lyric also confirms the 
album’s self-awareness: For the most 
part, the sprawling confusion feels 
intentional, ultimately leading up to 
a jointed and unified end.
The meaning of the album can 
perhaps 
best 
be 
accessed 
through 
its 
final 
track, 
“The Ultracheese.” 
The 
preceding 
tracks 
are 
often 
showy or occupied 
with 
themes 
of 
entertainment, 
from music to cinema, but this 
is where the trajectory finally 
becomes clear and the work climbs 
to a genuine end. Revelations like, 
“I’ve still got pictures of friends 
on the wall / I might look as if I’m 
deep in thought / But the truth is 
I’m probably not,” expose the gaps 
in the narrator’s own dramatic, 
attractive façades of fame. This final 
narrator questions the authenticity 
of past friendships and laments the 
doomed simplicity of “Just trying 
to orbit the sun / ... Just trying to 
be kind to someone,” allowing the 
album to stretch back toward a kind 
of societal truth linked with humble 
self-acknowledgment.
Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino 
may be bereft of a lot of the 
unapologetic verve that made earlier 
records like AM so electrifying and 
fresh, but it replaces this sentiment 
with a new (and more helpful) axis 
from which to understand the band. 
Although the album does sometimes 
veer into the sort of nettling 
pretension that makes fellow artists 
like Father John Misty stand out in a 
bad way, it is held together by a well 
crafted and ultimately clever story of 
fame, alienation and spectacle.

SINGLE
REVIEW

I love artists who push the 
boundaries of music, who con-
vince us to look beyond the 
boundaries that we create for 
ourselves and to create some-
thing new. However, there is 
also something to be said for 
consistency and the founda-
tion it provides. Dream-pop duo 
Beach House is the best at this. 
For nearly a decade, Victoria 
Legrand and Alex Scally have 
released creatively solid albums, 
proving that sources of inspira-
tion don’t have to be unsustain-
able. Their seventh release, aptly 
titled 7, was released on May 11, 
2018 to critical acclaim.

The fourth single off the 
album, “Black Car,” reveals the 
little tricks that have made Beach 
House great. In place of their 
signature drone (at least for the 
first minute) is an unsteady, cool 
marimba beat that slinks with 
anxiety. Even when the synth 
comes in, and its pitch increases 
steadily, bursting forth from the 
shadows, the marimba melody 
haunts the song like a specter, 
hidden in plain sight. Much of 
7 attempts to bring shadows 
to light, and “Black Car” is no 
exception. When Legrand croons 
“We want to go inside the cold 
/ It’s like a tomb, but it’s some-
thing to hold,” we, too, want to 
the cling to the darkness that 
provides a framework. “Black 
Car” hones in on the thrill fear 
of leaping into darker aspects of 
the soul, where feeling is murky, 
intense and deep.

I miss the old Kanye

As my Black Twitter time-

line blew up with Bill Cosby 

memes and “now this” videos 

about yet another act of violence 

against someone Black, my heart 

dropped to see Kanye West. I 

had recently seen a picture of 

him wearing a MAGA hat posing 

with two other politicians and I 

feared for anything he might say 

to make things worse. Neverthe-

less, I opened the video and tried 

to brace myself for whatever he 

might say. What followed were 

feelings of shame and disap-

pointment. Kanye had done 

the unthinkable, claiming that 

slavery was a “choice” for 400 

years. This was something that I 

may have expected from Stacey 

Dash but coming from the same 

man who released “The Col-

lege Dropout” I was devastated. 

It’s no secret that Kanye has 

long been on the bad side of the 

Black community, but this was 

something that even the biggest 

Kanye critic would have never 

seen coming.

The video spread like wild-

fire, instantly creating a war on 

two fronts. On one side there 

were the people who felt deeply 

offended and disappointed by 

Kanye’s remarks. For them this 

was the last straw, Kanye had 

not just fallen from grace — he 

crashed and burned. On the 

other side were the “stans” who 

tried to rationalize his remarks 

and look for the deeper meaning 

in his poorly worded statement. 

Many made posts about how 

they felt if there were so many 

slaves they should have easily 

overpowered their oppressors. 

While this may seem like a legit-

imate argument at first glance, it 

is very easy to forget the physi-

cal, mental and financial distress 

the people were under. Stripped 

of all resources, only given what 

was provided by a tyrant who 

was considered your owner. 

Over 150 years later, it is easy to 

look at sheer numbers and say 

what “should’ve” been done, not 

to mention how easy it is to over-

look the numerous revolts and 

uprisings that did occur during 

this time. We will never be able 

to put ourselves in the shoes of 

our ancestors and for that rea-

son alone it is not and will never 

be our place to speak on what 

should have and could have been 

done. As my mind filled with 

thoughts and emotions concern-

ing the remarks and how we got 

here, what came to the forefront 

of my mind were not the words 

of Kanye, but those of my broth-

er many years prior.

“When he lost the bear, he lost 

me.” These were my brother’s 

final words on his relationship 

with Kanye West. Following 

the release of the 2007 album 

“Graduation” (the final piece 

of the college-themed trilogy 

that also featured “The College 

Dropout” in 2004 and “Late 

Registration” in 2005), Kanye 

no longer incorporated the griz-

zly who came to be known as 

“Dropout Bear” in his music vid-

eos and cover art. After losing 

Dropout Bear, Kanye released 

“808s and Heartbreaks” in 2008 

which proved to show a more 

emotional side of Kanye and 

then “My Beautiful Dark Twist-

ed Fantasy” in 2010, the album 

that many consider the best of 

Kanye’s career. From there he 

released popular albums like 

“Watch the Throne” made with 

Jay-Z in 2011; however, Kanye 

would also release more contro-

versial albums such as “Yeezus” 

in 2013 (believed to be his worst 

album by many fans) and “The 

Life of Pablo” in 2016. No mat-

ter the project, for me and many 

other fans of early Kanye, no 

sound would be as honest and 

true as those during his tenure 

with Dropout Bear.

However, through his good 

and bad, nothing could seem 

to deter Kanye West fans. We 

were in a musical marriage of 

sorts, standing by Kanye for bet-

ter or for worse. We struggled 

with Kanye, continued to make 

excuses for whatever misun-

derstood actions he made and 

overanalyzed every lyric to cre-

ate even more reason to believe 

in his musical genius. However, 

over time, one by one, fans began 

to lose hope that we would ever 

get “the old Kanye” back. Many 

left in silence, some openly 

expressed 
their 
disappoint-

ment but no criticism would be 

more shocking to me than that 

of J. Cole. Releasing the song 

“False Prophets” in 2016, he 

spoke on his former apprecia-

tion of Kanye that bordered on 

allegiance, only to now be lim-

ited to reminiscing about the 

times when he could appreciate 

Kanye’s music. Now two years 

later J. Cole’s words seem to 

have aged like fine wine, a rather 

apt coincidence considering my 

sudden need for a drink after 

hearing Kanye’s remarks.

In the end, it had a good run. 

My relationship with Kanye was 

once that of an adult and baby. 

The adult is amazed by anything 

the baby does no matter how big 

or small and is seldom upset — 

if so, the anger lasts no longer 

than a few minutes. Kanye was 

the musical genius that could 

do no wrong, a beacon of hope 

for hip-hop and a role model 

for the next generation of eager 

MCs. Almost any aspiring MC, 

including myself, had studied 

“Graduation” and could likely 

rap a verse in every song. Now, 

my relationship with Kanye 

has turned into a cycle of disap-

pointment and forgiveness with 

the hope of a return to grace. 

Similar to the way you watch 

“Saturday Night Live” knowing 

that it will never be as funny as 

it was when they had Will Fer-

rell and Jimmy Fallon.

 May. Not only is it the 
time 
for 
Asian 
Pacific 
American Heritage Month 
(APAHM), but the first Mon-
day of this month signifies, 
essentially, the fashion Super 
Bowl formally known as the 
Met Gala. And per usual, in 
addition to other self-pro-
claimed fashion aficionados, 
I sat with both my cellphone 
in hand and Macbook on lap 
perusing Twitter timelines, 
the Vogue magazine website 
and Getty images— review-
ing each celebrity outfit as if 
we are in the New York City 
front lines as esteemed crit-
ics and not regular people on 
comfy sofas.
(My personal favorites, 
but definitely not all of the 
highlights, included SZA, 
Janelle Monáe, Solange, and 
Zendaya. Rihanna is obvi-
ously one of the best dressed 
as one of three co-chairs 
of the Met Gala adorned in 
custom John Galliano with 
Christian Louboutin heels. 
Shoutout to Chadwick Bose-
man for doing THAT for 
menswear.)
This year’s theme for 
the Met Gala was “Heav-
enly Bodies: Fashion and the 

Catholic Imagination”. This 
theme really spoke to me. 
It brings attention to some-
thing quite prevalent to my 
Filipino American upbring-
ing — religion and specifi-
cally Catholicism.
I grew up Catholic like 
many other Filipinx Ameri-
cans, which makes sense 
because the Philippines is 
super Catholic — 85 percent 
of the Philippines is Chris-
tian. I thought nothing of 
how my Filipino roots were 
related to Catholicism before 
coming to college. These 
important aspects of my life 
seemed rather separate. But 
after learning about Phil-
ippine history and culture 
in college, I realized they 
were not mutually exclu-
sive. Though there is a lot to 
say about Christianity in the 
Philippines, and while I am 
definitely not an expert in 
the matter, what I will say is 
that Catholicism was used 
by the Spanish as a tool with 
the ill intention of colonizing 
the Philippines. In succeed-
ing, interestingly enough, 
Catholicism as a whole? was 
transformed in the Phil-
ippines. 
Filipinx 
claimed 
Catholicism in many ways; 
pre-colonial practices were 
mixed with the religion to 

form Folk Catholicism. In 
times of hardship, like the 
People Powers Revolution 
to overthrow former dicta-
tor Ferdinand Marcos, many 
activists used the figure of 
Mother Mary to empower 
themselves. 

I think because of such 
rich context, I have a spe-
cial connection to this year’s 
Met Gala theme. Where 
many of the looks took to 
European art as reference, 
once I caught word of the 
theme, my mind immedi-
ately shifted to the Catholic 
imagery that situates itself in 

many Filipinx and Filipinx 
American 
communities. 
There is the Santo Niño— 
an icon of baby Jesus who is 
often depicted in a beautiful, 
embellished cape. There is 
also Maria Clara — a fictional 
character of the famous Phil-

ippine hero, José Rizal. She 
is the depiction of controver-
sial Filipina beauty based on 
purity in parallel to the Vir-
gin Mary that inspired a new 
sect of fashion. Moreover, I 
am reminded of the subtle 
moments from my life: See-
ing Santo Niño figures along 
with Catholic symbols on 

shelves in my own family’s 
and my extended families’ 
houses, the different pamay-
pays or fans that many would 
use in churches in the Philip-
pines to combat the intense 
heat. Though fashion can 
be thought of something 
superficial, it can be a his-
torical, artistic vehicle for 
social commentary. As I said 
before, there are many com-
plex implications of Catholi-
cism as it exists in Philippine 
culture that I can’t do justice 
in this musing of the Met 
Gala. There is a lot to say 
about how the conversion 
tactics of the Spanish speak 
to a greater conversation sur-
rounding colonialism. Not 
to mention that the effects 
of colonial mentality con-
tinue to perpetuate harm-
ful beauty standards, such 
as colorism and body image, 
in Filipinx and Filipinx 
American 
communities. 
On a slightly different note, 
there is a lot to talk about in 
terms of how some elements 
of Philippine culture before 
colonial rule have endured 
time and transformed Cath-
olic practices to make them 
unique to the Philippines 
and its many regions. Aes-
thetics here can play more 
sacred roles beyond appear-

ance. I myself frequently 
think about how Christian-
ity has influenced the experi-
ences of Filipinx families in 
the United States. But maybe 
those are even more the rea-
sons why I am so fixated with 
the Met Gala’s theme. I feel 
like “Catholic Imagination” 
fits perfectly in how Filipinx, 
and Filipinx Americans by 
consequence, have histori-
cally transformed practice 
while keeping core beliefs 
intact for the most part. It’s 
always fun to chit-chat with 
friends about which celeb-
rities we loved and which 
celebrities we could not be 
bothered with on that. That 
said, this first Monday of 
May had me thinking about 
myself: the fashion lover, the 
Filipino American, and my 
roots. It would have been so 
interesting to see more of 
how Catholicism has meta-
phorized from cultures that 
have experienced oppression 
from conversion like with the 
Philippines, perhaps even 
from a Filipinx designer.
Now, who would I want to 
style for the Met Gala? A cou-
ple of names come to mind. 
Probably 
eternal 
Filipina 
icon Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach, 
the former Miss Universe. 
Either her or Bretman Rock.

Defense critical 
in success for ‘M’

With one out and a runner on sec-
ond in the 10th inning Sunday after-
noon, junior center fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann gathered a flyball on one 
hop off the wall and fired a perfect 
throw into relay man Jack Blomgren 
who then delivered a strike to cut 
down the potential go-ahead run at 
the plate.
Blomgren exhibited elite range 
at shortstop on the next ball in play, 
sliding to his right to keep a ball in 
the infield and prevent the runner 
scoring from second.
An inning later, Michigan had yet 
another defense-fueled win.
Defense, as much as anything, 
has been the driving factor in the 
Wolverines’ miraculous turnaround 
that has seen them go 28-5 since a 
4-11 start. In its 16 losses, Michigan 
has committed 2.3 errors per game, 
compared to 1.1 in wins.
“We’ve 
always 
talked 
about 
building a program off pitching and 
defense,” said Wolverines coach 
Erik Bakich. “That’s always been our 
calling card.”
This weekend, the gap between 
winning and losing defense was 
clearer than ever. On Friday, four 
errors — all in the Michigan infield 
— led to seven unearned runs and a 
lopsided 10-3 defeat.
“With (sophomore left-hander) 
Tommy (Henry)’s five-spot in the 
second, we had a double play ball and 
we didn’t even get an out,” Bakich 
said. “We dropped it and if we turn 
a double play there, maybe Tommy’s 
whole entire outing is different.
“I think it was a simple lack of 
execution and we just need to be bet-
ter tomorrow.”
They were— but only slightly, 
with three errors including two 
committed by the starting pitcher, 
freshman left-hander Ben Dragani, 
as they fell 10-4.
Sunday was an entirely different 
story, however, as web gem defense 
throughout the game helped the 
Wolverines jump out to a 4-2 lead.
Sophomore right fielder Christian 
Bullock saved extra bases in the sec-
ond with a leaping grab and made 
a sliding catch on a sinking liner in 
the sixth. In the seventh, junior sec-
ond baseman Ako Thomas made a 
spinning play to his left and fielded 

an awkward chopper to make two 
tough outs. Blomgren started the 
ninth with a highlight reel bare-
handed throw across the diamond.
“Pitching and defense were the 
critical factors today,” Bakich said. 
“Defense especially.”
But for all of the Wolverines’ 
defensive excellence through eight 
innings, their flaws shone through 
in a nearly catastrophic ninth, in 
which Illinois plated two runs to 
send the game to extra innings. The 
game-tying play came via a trio of 
defensive mistakes, continuing an 
all-too-familiar 
commonality 
in 
Michigan’s runs allowed.
A wild pitch with runners on first 
and second moved the tying run into 
scoring position. Later during that 
at-bat, junior left-hander William 
Tribucher looked to have induced 
a game-ending groundout to first 
but failed to cover the base, allow-
ing a run to score from third. The 
damage could have ended there, 
but freshman first baseman Jesse 
Franklin did not see left fielder 
Doran Turchin charging home from 
second until the scoreboard at Ray 
Fisher Stadium read 4-4.
“After playing defense so well the 
entire game, we had some miscues 
there in the ninth,” Bakich said. 
“Not covering first, mental mistake, 
allowing a guy to score from second 
on an infield hit.
“You can’t expect to beat very 
good teams and make those mis-
takes, especially late, so it cost us.”
The Wolverines have gone just 
2-4 in their two biggest series of Big 
Ten play— series losses to Illinois 
and Iowa. In those four losses they 
have committed 10 errors, leading to 
the multiple, avoidable losses.
Next weekend’s matchup against 
Purdue in West Lafayette, though, 
provides Michigan an opportunity 
for redemption. The third-place 
Boilermakers pose a formidable test, 
one the Wolverines likely need to ace 
to have a chance at their first Big Ten 
title in a decade.
“There’s no two ways around it. 
The defense we played today is the 
defense we’re gonna need to play if 
we’re gonna be a championship or a 
postseason team,” Bakich said.
“Because the defense we played 
the first two days is not gonna be 
conducive to playing deep into 
June.”

A Crisis of Confidence

BASEBALL

MADISON — It was a long trek 
back to the bus.
The Michigan softball team 
was tired and defeated, and it was 
hard to blame the players. After 
all, it was 1 AM — a result of hours 
of rain delays that pushed the 
Wolverines’ game 
back until after 10 
PM —and every-
thing 
had 
gone 
wrong. 
Having 
swept the season 
series — including 
a run-rule victory 
in East Lansing — 
top-seed 
Michi-
gan was heavily 
favored over No. 
8 seed Michigan 
State in the Big Ten Tournament 
quarterfinals. But instead, it lost 
7-0 in a game even more one-sid-
ed than the score indicates.
And though the Wolverines’ 
season isn’t over, the loss felt 
foreboding. After all, an early 
conference 
tournament 
exit 
never bodes well for a team’s 
NCAA Tournament prospects.
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins stood outside, giving 
an interview.
“I’m sorry you came all the way 
out here to see that,” she said.
Those words said it all.
Behind her, the players filed 
onto the bus. Their faces were 
streaked with water — from the 
rain or from tears, it was impos-
sible to tell. They didn’t talk to 
each other. They were alone with 

their thoughts, and all that was 
left to do was load their suitcas-
es, hop on the bus and wonder, 
“What happened?”
The truth was, everything 
happened. It was a bad game at 
an inopportune time, yes. But 
more than that, it was a deterio-
ration of confidence that failed 
the Wolverines — the very con-
fidence that made 
them the team to 
beat in the first 
place.
It started with 
freshman 
left-
hander 
Meghan 
Beaubien. 
Ear-
lier in the season, 
when nothing else 
was working, she 
put Michigan on 
her back and kept 
the Wolverines in games they had 
no business being in. More than 
that, her tenacity never wavered 
— earning her the nickname 
“Beau-bot.” It didn’t matter how 
big the jam, she could get out of it.
Until Friday.
Even 
before 
the 
Spartans 
struck first — on a two-run sin-
gle by Lea Foerster — Beaubien 
pitched tentatively. She nibbled 
the zone, and Michigan State 
wouldn’t bite. And after the 
Spartans got on the board, it all 
spiraled downward. When she 
got into another jam in the top 
of the fifth, the “Beau-bot” was 
nowhere to be seen. Instead, she 
allowed two runs to score before 
Hutchins took mercy and pulled 
her with the bases loaded and 
still no one out.

It wasn’t just Beaubien. All 
pitchers have off-days, and this 
team is built to pick her up when 
she needed it. But at the plate 
things weren’t any better. The 
lineup at its best is a three-head-
ed monster: contact at the top, 
power in the middle and speed at 
the bottom. 
Against 
Michigan 
State, 
though, the Wolverines struck 
out 10 times. They had just three 
hits, all singles. The more dire 
the situation grew, the more 
Michigan pressed at the plate. 
The grinding at-bats from earlier 
in the season were gone. Instead, 
with two strikes came a sense of 
resignation.
“We talk a lot about trust (but) 
you’ve gotta really believe it,” 
Hutchins said. “And we have not 
shown that we do.”
In their finest moments, the 
Wolverines are full of confidence 
and swagger, always laughing 
and joking and cheering.
On Friday, they were quiet.
Michigan always expected a 
Big Ten Tournament champion-
ship. During the regular season, 
the Wolverines never doubted 
that they were capable.
But the postseason is a whole 
different battle, and Michigan’s 
confidence evaporated when it 
was most vital.
And as the Wolverines retreat-
ed to the bus after the game, the 
only thing left to do was pick up 
the pieces.

It was a bad 
game at an 
inopportune 
time

Jesse Franklin’s incredible freshman turnaround

For the most part, John Morning-
star knew what was about to happen. 
The softball coach was sitting in a suite 
at a Toledo Mud Hens minor league 
baseball game with some friends 
and co-workers watching the Detroit 
Tigers on a TV at the back of the suite.
Detroit was batting with less than 
two outs and a runner on first, so he 
figured that the Tigers would try and 
advance the man on base somehow. 
The niece of one of his coaching part-
ners, a bright-eyed tween softball 
pitcher, suggested that it was a bunting 
situation.
Plop. Indeed, it was a bunt. The 
Tigers advanced a runner. As the game 
progressed, the two continued to dis-
cuss the intricacies of baseball, and 
Morningstar became more and more 
astounded at the child’s innate knowl-
edge of the game.
“I’m sitting here, talking to a 12-year 
old girl about advanced strategy in a 
baseball game like I would talk to an 
adult that played the game all of their 
life,” Morningstar thought to himself. 
“Wow.”
That girl wasn’t the only truly pro-
phetic one sitting in the box at Fifth 
Third Field. It would be years before 
the girl standing next to him would 
lead the nation in victories as a col-
lege freshman, compile a 32-3 record 
with 0.90 earned run average and be 
a successful engineering student, but 
Morningstar knew that very day: he 
was in the presence of a star.Her name 
was Meghan Beaubien.
****
The moment Beaubien stepped 
onto the sprawling green lawns of 
Saint Mary’s Catholic Central High 
School in Monroe, Mich., she already 
had a plan. She was determined to take 
the hardest possible classes and be the 
valedictorian. Hardly surprising for 
someone who scored a 29 on her ACT 
— as an eighth grader.
As if that weren’t enough, she was 
determined to play softball at Michi-
gan. Beaubien went to Michigan soft-
ball games many times during her 
childhood, and she sat in awe of the 
atmosphere there each time she went.
The summer before her freshman 
year of high school, Beaubien was 
already neck deep in the recruiting 
process. Even though she had been 
pitching since she was seven years 
old and paired that experience with a 
longstanding, acute knowledge of the 
game, the possibility of high-level soft-
ball as a future for Beaubien became 
closer and closer to becoming a reality.

Even though Beaubien had been to 
different college softball camps like 
Michigan State’s, Tennessee’s softball 
camp was a watershed moment for 
the left hander. No conference in all 
of college softball was as strong as the 
Southeastern Conference was.
She rose to the moment and clocked 
in at 65 miles per hour fastball on the 
radar gun. Tennessee co-head coaches 
and NFCA Hall of Famers Karen and 
Ralph Weekly were impressed and 
congratulated Beaubien.
“Wow this is a big SEC school,” 
Beaubien thought. “And if that coach is 
impressed by what I did, I can impress 
other coaches as well.”
Beaubien thanked the two coaches, 
but the Weeklys knew they wouldn’t 
have much of a chance with the Michi-
gan native.
“Look,” Ralph Weekly said, accord-
ing to Beaubien. “Call us if [Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins] passes on you, 
but we don’t think she will.”
From that point on, Beaubien — 
who ended up being ranked as the No. 
6 recruit in the Country by FloSoftball.
com in 2017 — was a hot commodity. 
Though she didn’t hear back from the 
Volunteers, she racked up offers from 
Ohio State, Northwestern, Michigan 
State and two SEC schools. But Michi-
gan remained her preference.
The prospect of being a Wolverine 
seemed almost too good to be true. 
Beaubien lived less than an hour away 
from Ann Arbor, had attended games 
at Michigan’s Alumni Field in the past 
and was well on her way to becom-
ing a strong enough student to attend 
the school, with or without athletics. 
Hutchins and assistant coach Jennifer 
Brundage attended a few of Beaubien’s 
games at St. Mary Catholic Central her 
freshman year and remained in close 
contact with the left-hander knowing 
her interest in playing for Michigan.
The coach invited Beaubien — 
like she did with many recruits — to 
watch Michigan football play Ohio 
State. While at first Beaubien assumed 
that this was just another step in the 
recruiting machine for Michigan, 
Hutchins’ words over the phone stuck 
out:
“When you’re there, I want to talk 
about your future,” Hutchins said. “At 
Michigan.”
Beaubien’s heart jumped out of 
her chest. She basically had one part 
of her three-part plan in the bag. Yet, 
when Hutchins pulled her into the 
tunnel at Michigan Stadium during 
halftime of the game and extended her 
an offer, Beaubien didn’t accept the it 
right away. Like any smart player, she 
needed time to think about and comb 

through her options.
No matter where Beaubien visited 
after that, though, it always came back 
to Michigan.
Was this school as academically 
renowned as Michigan?
Even if it was, how good is the soft-
ball program compared to Michigan’s?
Was this school the right fit?
Sure, it might’ve been easy to accept 
the offer from her dream school imme-
diately, but Beaubien took time to look 
at every opportunity in front of her. 
About a month after the original offer, 
all it took was one hour of meetings 
with Hutchins and the coaching staff 
to discuss academics and finances to 
make Beaubien a Wolverine.
But that was just one goal to check 
off her list. With three years of high 
school left, Beaubien had more accom-
plishments in mind. As a sophomore, 
Beaubien led SMCC to its first of three 
consecutive Michigan state champi-
onships. She never allowed a run in 
any of her championship appearances 
— and even threw a perfect game as a 
junior. All three years, she was named 
Michigan Gatorade Player of the Year.
As much as she was on top of the 
softball world, though, Beaubien 
still had yet to quench her academic 
desires. She originally wanted to take 
an Honors Anatomy and Physiol-
ogy class, but didn’t have room in her 
normal schedule to take it with all the 
other Honors and Advanced Place-
ment classes already on deck. Rather 
than just dropping the class, Beaubien 
opted to take it as an independent 
study.
“She is a student that does not just 
settle for the average or norm,” said 
Beaubien’s Honors Anatomy and 
Physiology teacher Scott Hoffmann. 
“She wants to know all the details and 
inter-workings that go with finding a 
solution or answer to a problem. She 
took pride in going above and beyond 
and when she had setbacks, which 
were few, she took it as a personal chal-
lenge to do better.”
After seeing Beaubien thrive in 
the class and find success in calculus, 
chemistry and biology, Hoffmann 
pulled Beaubien aside one day and 
implored her to explore biomedical 
engineering. The combination of math 
and human anatomy piqued her inter-
est, and Michigan happened to have a 
top-ranked program in that depart-
ment.
It’s not hard to see where some 
of those smarts and determination 
comes from. Beaubien’s dad, Jason, 
was a softball coach in his own right, 
while her mom, Kim, was a former 
soccer player at Boston College. Jason, 

in fact, coached Beaubien for much of 
her early softball career and spent time 
coaching with Morningstar as well.
The father-daughter duo worked 
together through Beaubien’s fresh-
man year at St. Mary Catholic Central. 
At that point, however, Jason realized 
that maybe, Beaubien didn’t need him 
anymore as a coach — he was coaching 
to spend time with her rather than to 
actually guide her softball journey.
“From that point on, I had to be a 
supportive parent,” Jason said. “At the 
time it was hard, but looking back on it 
it was a great decision…I still was close 
to her, but I was never on the staff any-
more. But obviously, it worked out.”
That didn’t mean that Jason or Kim 
were not part of Beaubien’s athletic 
life by any means — in fact, quite the 
opposite. Every Sunday, the Beaubien 
family would drive Meghan back and 
forth from their home in Newport to 
Chicago so she could practice with her 
travel team, the Beverly Bandits. Jason 
estimated that going to Chicago cost 
the family about 10 hours in travel time 
per weekend — and that doesn’t even 
include cross-country trips to tourna-
ments.
To whom much is given, though, 
much is expected. In those car rides 
across the Michigan countryside, 
Beaubien never put her feet up on the 
seat and played on her phone. She did 
two things and two things only in the 
back seat of her dad’s car: sleep, or man-
age the mountains of science and math 
coursework she was assigned. On 
some school nights, Beaubien would 
stay up all night doing homework, even 
after long practices or games.
Coaches, teammates and others 
who know Beaubien are quick to talk 
about that kind of determination, her 
aforementioned brand of competitive-
ness and unmatched intellect. What 
they’re also eager to talk about, though, 
is the side of Meghan that the average 
fan might not see from far away in the 
stands, or a school acquaintance might 
see passing her by in the hallway.
In one of her first trips with the 
Bandits, Beaubien and a group of 14Us 
traveled to California for a showcase. 
Before the first game, Bandits head 
coach Bill Conroy and the players 
met for breakfast. He noticed that 
most of the players were in uniform, 
or pre-game clothes, per usual. Beau-
bien, however, showed up in the hotel’s 
bathrobe, donning a shower cap on her 
head like it was a crown. While some 
of her teammates laughed at her outfit, 
the pitcher sat down, ate her breakfast 
and went through the meetings like 
nothing was wrong.
“She was not embarrassed or gun 

shy at all about coming down less than 
her stellar self,” Conroy said. “I thought 
she could laugh at herself, and she has a 
unique personality that I thought was 
a good mix of being really competitive, 
really smart but also being able to have 
fun.”
It didn’t take long for Beaubien 
to prove Conroy right in all three of 
those phases. Beaubien pitched well 
for the Bandits, who despite playing 
up multiple levels to 18Us, beat the 18U 
defending national champions from 
Southern California in the last game of 
the showcase.
At the end of games, Conroy usually 
talks to each one of his players and tells 
each one what she did well during the 
game and where she might improve. 
For players like Beaubien, that usually 
amounted to a good amount of praise, 
with a few adjustments for the future.
As he went down the lineup after 
the victory, Conroy got to one of the 
Bandits’ first basemen and paused. 
He had nothing good to say about her 
— she got multiple people thrown out 
because she didn’t protect them and 
missed a bunch of signs. Before Conroy 
could say anything, though, he heard a 
familiar voice.
“Xio!” Beaubien exclaimed. “You’re 
so beautiful!”
The whole locker room erupted 
in laughter. Conroy chose not to offer 
any criticism of the player because 
Beaubien’s humor served that purpose 
without hurting her feelings. On the 
surface, Beaubien’s comment might 
just seem like a joke, but her quick 
thinking showed Conroy that Beau-
bien was ready more to go far — in the 
softball world and as a student.
“When you have academics and 
athletic ability and you understand 
how to be a good teammate from not 
just a physical standpoint but a mental 
and emotional aspect as well, those 
are the three aspects that I look at as a 
coach to determine what kind of ath-
lete you’re dealing with,” Conroy said.
Indeed Beaubien had, and still 
has, all those traits. Looking back 
at all those years of hard work from 
Conroy’s criteria, Beaubien reached 
perfection. Not only was she able to 
maintain a fine balance between her 
pitching life and taking the hardest 
classes at her school, but Beaubien did 
in fact successfully check off her goal 
of becoming valedictorian and pitch at 
Michigan.
Maybe it was destiny. Maybe Beau-
bien knew from day one that she would 
reach those goals. Maybe her family 
and coaches did too. One thing is for 
certain — Beaubien, just like she did in 
that Mud Hens suite, called her shot.

Five years later, Trey Burke 

discovers a new beginning

Trey Burke lined up across 
from Corey Person with only 
winning on his mind.
This wasn’t a practice drill 
between the two guards — 
Burke a sophomore on his way 
to winning National Player 
of the Year, Person a walk-on 
in his senior year. Nor was it 
a pickup game after practice. 
It wasn’t even on a basketball 
court.
In a football tailgate lot out-
side Michigan Stadium, the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team was hosting an event for 
recruits, and a pickup football 
game had broken out. Playing 
wide receiver, Burke’s competi-
tive urge kicked in.
“He wanted to win so bad — 
not only did he want to win, he 
wanted to embarrass (Person),” 
recalled then-graduate man-
ager Kyle Barlow. “And (Burke) 
dominated him.”
It didn’t matter that this was 
a different sport. It didn’t mat-
ter that this was as informal a 
setting as you could get. Burke 
had to win, and he did.
That was what every bas-
ketball recruit visiting Ann 
Arbor realized that day— and 
what the Wolverines’ coaching 
staff had come to understand 
a year prior—when they saw 
Burke play against live com-
petition for the first time at a 
closed-door scrimmage against 

Toledo. Trey Burke, it turns out, 
makes a strong first impression.
On that day in October 2011, 
Burke had walked into the 
scrimmage with Stu Douglass, 
the presumptive starter at point 
guard. Instead, video analyst 
Pete Kahler, assistant coach 
LaVall Jordan and administra-
tive specialist C.J. Lee watched 
together, mouths agape, as 
Burke came off the bench and 
gave Michigan its answer.
Almost immediately, Burke 
stripped the ball from an oppos-
ing player, blew by Toledo’s 
transition defense and scored. 
He followed that by coming 
off a ball-screen and nailing 
a jumper, then picking up an 
assist. The coaching staff had 
known Burke was good, but not 
this good, and not this soon.
“We’re like, ‘Whoa. We 
might need to give this kid the 
key to the car,’ ” Kahler said. “It 
was just very clear right away 
that (Burke) was just more ath-
letic and more skilled than any-
body on the court.”
“It was the first experience 
of him in live competition,” 
Lee, who played point guard at 
Michigan between 2007 and 
2009, added. “And it was some-
thing that was just noticeable. 
It’s like, ‘This guy is made to do 
this.’ ”
When Burke came out, the 
offense slowed down. When he 
checked back in, it sped right 
back up. This wasn’t just a few 
good minutes. It was a precur-

sor for the next two seasons.
Anyone with eyes knew 
then and there that Burke was 
simply better than Douglass. 
Including Douglass.
“Stu went up to (Michigan) 
coach (John) Beilein and said, 
you know, ‘Coach, we gotta 
start him at the point,’ ” Kahler 
recalled.
It took all of one game — 
the opener against Division II 
Ferris State — for that to come 
to fruition. Three days later 
when the Wolverines faced 
Towson, Beilein heeded Dou-
glass’ advice. The starting job 
belonged to Burke.
Burke’s legend starts there 
and, for now, ends 18 months 
later with a seemingly clean 
block, a whistle and a national 
championship game loss to 
Louisville. 
Everything 
that 
happens after is often consid-
ered a mere footnote because 
until four months ago, Burke 
was just another player who 
peaked in college before flam-
ing out at the next level. Burke 
still may end up being just that, 
but he’s as close to rewriting 
that script as ever.
 ***
There’s a formula to a season 
ending: Coaches frustrated, 
teammates nervous for the 
impending finish, shots that 
normally fall rimming out. In 
the 2013 Sweet 16 against Kan-
sas, Michigan was following 
that to a T—until Burke broke it.
Burke had been trying to 

rally the troops throughout the 
second half, telling his team-
mates in timeout huddles it 
wasn’t over, they could come 
back — all the things you say 
partly because you believe 
them and partly because not 
saying them would be admit-
ting defeat. It wasn’t until the 
Wolverines were down eight 
with two minutes to go and 
Burke forced a 10-second call 
on the Jayhawks’ Elijah John-
son that they became more 
than platitudes.
At that point, LaVall Jordan 
started to holler, using a white 
Gatorade towel to smack the 
raised court, getting louder 
with each shot.
As Burke kept hitting shots 
— a stepback 3-pointer over Jeff 
Withey to cut the deficit to five, 
a transition layup to cut it to 
three — Jordan began ignoring 
the playcalls Kahler suggested 
to him.
“Pete!” Kahler remembered 
him yelling. “Just let that boy 
rock!”
When Burke hit a shot, 
Jordan would scream, “That 
boy is special!” annunciating 
each word by hitting the towel 
against the court, sending fluff 
towards Kahler, as the rest of 
the bench stared, wide-eyed, 
the Wolverines pulling ever 
closer.
Still, Michigan needed to 
foul Johnson and pray for a miss 
on the front end of a 1-and-1 to 
have a chance to tie at the end of 
regulation. Whether Johnson 
made or missed his free throws, 
the plan was the same: get the 
ball in as fast as possible, set two 
high ball-screens for Burke and 
go from there.
Everyone knew the last 
shot — Michigan still needing 
a 3-pointer to tie — belonged to 
Burke. But he wasn’t supposed 
to pull up, at least not from 
30 feet. He did anyway and 
drained it.
“The follow-through was 
like a goose-neck,” said then-
junior guard Tim Hardaway 
Jr. “It was perfect, pretty, you 
couldn’t teach it any better.”
“After (Burke) hit the shot 
… and then we all went to the 
timeout, he kept saying, ‘We’re 
not losing this game,’ ” then-
senior guard Eso Akunne 
recalled.
The Wolverines still had to 
defend with 4.3 seconds left, a 
situation they had blown ear-
lier in the season after a Hard-
away triple had seemingly won 

a game at Wisconsin. But after 
Naadir Tharpe’s try at a game-
winner fell short, Michigan 
could see an impending loss on 
the face of every Kansas player.
Throughout that year — 
even with a starting lineup that 
included three other future 
NBA Draftees — Michigan had 
leaned on Burke, and Burke 
had delivered. Now, with the 
season on the line, he had done 
so again.
“It’s almost like a warm 
blanket,” Kahler said. “You’d go 
on the court and (know) that, 
no matter what happened, we 
had that great chance of win-
ning. We were probably gonna 
win because we had Trey 
Burke on the team.”
The blown lead oozed into 
the Jayhawks’ body language 
and the comeback into Michi-
gan’s, as Burke rollicked around 
the court, scoring the Wolver-
ines’ first five points of over-
time. All the while, Jordan kept 
thwacking that towel.
“Just let him go!” Kahler 
recalled Jordan belting. “Don’t 
need to run plays, just set a ball-
screen, let him go to work.”
When the buzzer sounded, 
handing Michigan an impos-
sible 87-85 victory, it had Burke 
to thank.
“Probably next to getting 
married, one of the best feelings 
in the world,” Kahler said. “I’m 
serious.”
***
Needless to say, Burke hadn’t 
expected to be taking commer-
cial flights to Canton, Ohio and 
Greensboro, and North Caro-
lina four years later. But with 
his basketball career in need 
of a revival, life took Burke to 
White Plains, New York, home 
of the G-League’s Westchester 
Knicks.
Four years after Burke 
played in front of the entire 
country during the Final Four, 
he was running point in front 
of barren arenas off the beaten 
path. At Michigan, Burke had 
been vocal in huddles during 
games, but often led by exam-
ple. Now, at age 25, he was one 
of the team’s oldest, most expe-
rienced players.
With the Wolverines, the 
closest Burke had come to men-
torship was when Caris LeVert 
— another future NBA player 
from the Columbus area and 
a year behind Burke — came 
to Michigan. The two trash-
talked, telling each other, “You 
can’t guard me,” until there was 

no choice but settle it on the 
court. They played before prac-
tice, after practice — even on 
gamedays, at least until Kahler 
kicked them out of the gym.
“They would go back and 
forth — who can’t guard who, 
or who would win 1-on-1 — 
and then there was just sorta, 
‘Alright, shut up and grab a ball,’ 
” Person said. “Next thing you 
know, they’re at it again.”
In 
Westchester 
though, 
Burke embraced being the old 
guy in the locker room.
Burke told teammates where 
they had to be in practice. He 
told them about his time in the 
NBA — about how, early in his 
career, an opposing player blew 
by him for a layup and how 
Burke realized this was differ-
ent than college — and about 
anything else they asked. In 
film sessions, he spoke up.
“We had about seven or 
eight rookies — everybody was 
instantly willing to listen and 
learn, because not too many 
times, coming in your first year, 
you get that cool of an opportu-
nity to have somebody like that 
around,” said Paul Watson Jr., 
a Westchester guard last sea-
son. “... Trey was a leader for us 
instantly.”
And, most importantly, after 
his career had sunk to its low-
est point, Burke was having fun 
again.
In one contest against the 
Fort Wayne Mad Ants, he was 
held scoreless in the first half. 
The Mad Ants focused their 
entire defense around trapping 
him. Then Burke came out of 
the locker room and went on a 
tear, scoring 28 in the second 
half of what became a victory.
“(Burke) told the guys (at 
halftime), he said, ‘I’m good. 
You guys keep doin’ what 
you’re doin’. You guys are open 
and I’m gonna find you,’ ” said 
Westchester 
Knicks 
coach 
Mike Miller. “... And then (in) 
the second half, it balanced out 
and he went on one of those 
runs.”
Miller and Burke’s team-
mates alike all knew from 
the day he signed, the Knicks 
would call him up eventually. 
When that call finally came in 
mid-January—bringing Burke 
a little less than an hour south 
and a second chance— there 
was little room to squander it.
