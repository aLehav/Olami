RHA passes
resolution in
support of
open housing'

RHA and University
Housing will draft
gender-neutral
option plan
By DEBJANI MUKHERJEE
Daily Staff Reporter
The University's Residence
Halls Association passed a reso-
lution last night in support of
bringing a gender-neutral hous-
ing option to University Housing.
The proposal - called the
Resolution to Support and Inves-
tigate Open Housing at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Ann Arbor
- states that RHA supports
gender-neutral housing and that,
by January 2011, RHA and Uni-
versity Housing will draw-up a
gender-neutral housing or "Open
Housing" report.
Drafted by four members of
RHA, the resolution also states
that the Gender Neutral Housing
Working Group - agroup created
by RHA that consists of students
from organizations like RHA, the
Michigan Student Assembly and
the Spectrum Center, Residence
Hall staff members and Universi-
ty Housing administrators - will
continue working on developing
a gender-neutral housing option

at the University next semester.
LSA freshman Trevor Grieb,
next year's RHA president and
one of the four people who pre-
sented the resolution, said- RHA
will have meetings to set goals
for establishing gender-neutral
housing, where it will discuss
various methods of accomplish-
ing these goals. It aims to have
a portfolio of options ready by
January 2011.
"At this point, our ideas are
still very broad; very develop-
mental," Grieb said.
A recent survey conducted
by RHA accelerated the process
of working toward establishing
gender-neutral housing in resi-
dence halls, according to Grieb.
The survey showed that about
67 percent of students who
responded agree that gender-
neutral housing would foster a
more inclusive college commu-
nity. Out of this 67 percent, about
37 percent said that they would
pick gender-neutral housing if it
were an option available through
University Housing. The survey
was sent to 9,545 students and
1,785 responded - a 19-percent
response rate.

Fred Veigel, president of the Huron Valley Central Labor Council, rallies supporters of the Lecturers' Employee Organization outside the Fleming Administration Building yester-
day. The protest came in the midst of LEO's contract negotiations with the University and one week after University officials decided not to re-appoint LEO's vice president.

and 'ot-bllie' asprofssor

At rally, lecturers'
union also protested
non-reappointment
of top official
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
As yellow balloons bearing
the lion crest of the Lecturers'
Employee Organization blew
in the air, about 100 supporters
stood in solidarity with the lec-
turers union outside the Flem-
ing Administration Building
yesterday.

The rally comes while the
union is currently in contract
negotiations with the University
and one week after University
officials decided not to reap-
point Kirsten Herold, the vice-
president of LEO.
Standing on top of a cement
platform, Marc Ammerlaan,
co-chair of LEO and a biology
lecturer, kicked off the rally by
equating the skills and quality
of lecturers - who are not on
a tenure track - with tenured
professors.
"We are just as credentialed
and just as qualified and just as
gray and just as pot-bellied as
the tenured track faculty mem-

bers," Ammerlaan said.
Elizabeth Axelson, lead nego-
tiator of LEO and lecturer in
the University's English Lan-
guage Institute, told the crowd
that LEO demands that lectur-
ers be paid the same salary as a
University professor, excluding
any monetary gains professors
get for research. The Univer-
sity turned down this proposal,
which includes an eight-year
implementation plan, earlier
this year, she said.
Also present at the rally was
a Band-Aid-clad poster signed
by LEO supporters, signifying
the lecturers' opposition to the
University's possible decision

to cut more lecturer positions,
Axelson said.
Axelson told the crowd that
organizing rallies such as this
to garner support is essential
for the success of LEO's negotia-
tions.
"You can't sit in a little room
with management and get acon-
tract on your own," she said.
"You have to have the strength
of your members and your mem-
bers' supporters."
In an interview last month,
University Provost Teresa Sulli-
van said officials in her office have
no plans to lay off lecturers.
"Right now our plans don't

About 50 people from the Ann
Arbor community and the greater
Southeastern Michigan area gath-

ered at the Diag last night for Take
Back The Night, an annual rally
intended to raise awareness about
sexual assault and to show support
for victims.
The national organization of

"We look at this as a celebra-

Race heating up for
seats of state Reps.
Byrnes, Warren
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
With state Reps. Rebekah
Warren (D-Ann Arbor) and Pam
Byrnes (D-Lyndon Twp.) vying
for the seat currently held by state
Senator Liz Brater (D-Ann Arbor)
this November, the race for their

seats is startingto heat up.
Looking to fill Warren's posi-
tion as House Rep. for the 53rd
district are two Ann Arbor Demo-
crats: Washtenaw County Com-
missioner Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) and Ned Staebler (D-Ann
Arbor), the vice president of capi-
tal access and business accelera-
tion at the Michigan Economic
Development Corporation.
A University alum, Irwin said
he studied political science as a
student and throughout his time
as county commissioner.

"I want to change the world,
and this seems like a good place
to continue my efforts in that
regard," he said.
Irwin said he believes that
state-level politics are critical in
addressing issues that will affect
the lives of Michigan residents.
"Ever since I've started get-
ting involved with politics, I've
always been interested in issues
at the state level because that's
where a lot of the most important
decisions are made," Irwin said.

'Smart Grid' will
bring $5M to state
from federal gov't
Michigan is getting about $5
million from the federal govern-
ment to train electricians and other
workers related to "smart grid"
development.
U.S. Energy Secretary Steven
Chu announced the grant yester-
day and said it could help train
about 600 Michigan workers. The
money comes from the federal
stimulus program.
a The retraining program could
coverunemployed workers or those
who have jobs but are looking to
upgrade. The program is aimed at
preparing the next generation of
workers in the utility and electrical
manufacturing industries.
The Michigan Department
of Energy, Labor and Economic
Growth will receive about $4.4
million for the program.

Parents of Detroit
shooting victims to
sue school district
A group of parents is suing
Detroit Public Schools, two
security guards and three men
charged in the fatal shooting of
one teen and wounding of three
others.
The Detroit Free Press report-
ed yesterday that Bridget Walker,
Kenota Slater, Carol Merriweath-
er and Liz McCants have filed a
lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit
Court.
The suit claims school offi-
cials failed to prevent the Oct.
16, 2008 attack near Henry Ford
High School which followed a
fight inside the building earlier
that day.
Walker's 16-year-old son, .
Christopher, was killed.
The three men charged in the
shooting are in their late teens or
early 20s. Two are serving prison
sentences. The third man was
acquitted.
EAST HAMPTON, New York
Marine biologists
try to ease beached
whale's suffering
A team worked yesterday to
ease the suffering of a young
humpback whale as it lay dying on
a Long Island beach.
.The 20- to 25-foot-long whale,
less than a year old, was found
stranded Tuesday. Marine scien-
tists said that if freed, the animal
would not be able to survive on its
own.
David Morin, a marine mam-
mal biologist with the National
Marine Fisheries Service, said
the original plan was to euthanize
the whale. But the plan had to be
changed partly because of con-
cerns that a lethal injection that
missed would leave the drugs in
the water.
"Instead of becoming a eutha-

nasia attempt, it became a seda-
tive attempt to ease the animal's
suffering," Morin said.
The least non-invasive plan
would be to let Nature take its
course, but the animal could
take days to die and would be
suffering, said Mendy Garron, a
regional marine mammal strand-
ing coordinator with the fisheries
service.
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan
Leaders of Kyrgyz
uprising say they

Consolidating their victory after
a bloody uprising, opposition lead-

months and assured the U.S. it can
keep a strategic air base here - at
least for now.
There were signs of instability,
though, as deposed President Kur-
manbek Bakiyev refused to relin-
quish power after the revolt, which
left at least 75 people dead and hun-
dreds wounded. As he spoke, gun-
* fire broke out after nightfall in the
capital, Bishkek.
With darkness descending, rov-
ing bands of armed marauders
trawled the streets of the capital,
despite warnings from the opposi-
tion leadership that looters would
be shot.
Crowds gathering at the ran-
sacked government headquarters
earlier in the day angrily shouted
anti-Bakiyev slogans.

200 feared dead after mudslide in Brazil

Heavy rains in Rio
cause mudslide, 60
homes destroyed
NITEROI, Brazil (AP) - They
are all gone. The Evangelical
church where worshippers were
praying. A daycare center whare
kids were playing. The pizza par-
lor where a family was eating.
All were buried under a moun-
tain of mud, garbage and stone
when yet another landslide hit
metropolitan Rio de Janeiro
late Wednesday. This one swept
through the Morro Bumba slum,
engulfing as many as 200 people
and 60 homes. Nothing was left
behind but a massive crater of
blackened, sodden earth and the
remnants of flimsy brick shacks.
"I had just picked up my
10-year-old son from the day
care. We walked down the hill
to the street, and within 10 min-
utes, my community collapsed,"
said Patricia Faria, 28, crying as
she watched heavy machinery
dump the remains of her life into
a waiting truck. "All I have left is
what you see on me - and my son.
Thank God, I have my son."
Rio state health secretary Ser-
gio Cortes said it was hard to say
how many people were buried in
the latest slide. "A worse-case sce-
nario is 200," he told The Associ-
ated Press. "We know that about
60 houses were buried."
Already 161 people have been
confirmed dead in the heavy rains
that began Monday in Rio, most
of them swept away in landslides
that roared through city slums
built on steep, unstable hillsides.
The death toll surpasses that
of flooding and mudslides in the
southern state of Santa Catarina in

2008, which killed nearly 130 peo-
ple and displaced about 80,000.
"In our experience, it's an
instant death," Pedro Machado,
undersecretary of Rio state's Civil
Defense department, said of the
victims buried by landslides.
Faria said she was certain peo-
ple were buried inside the Morro
Bumba slum's Assembly of God
church, which collapsed during
nightly services.
Clesio Araujo, 39, said he nar-
rowly escaped the slide, leaving
a pizza parlor just a few minutes
before the earth gave way. He said
a family was still inside.
The destruction was com-
pounded because the slum is
largely built atop an old garbage
dump, making it especially unsta-
ble and vulnerable to the heavy
rains, said Agostinho Guerreiro,
president of Rio's main associa-
tion of engineers and architects.
"It is very fragile soil. It
couldn't hold. The houses came
down, destroying the ones below
them," Guerreiro told Globo TV.
"It was a tragedy foretold."
The federal government
announced an emergency fund
of $114 million to help Rio state,
where the slum is located, to deal
with the mudslides and flooding.
But the money will be of lit-
tle help to people who have no
choice but to live in such pre-
carious sections of the city, said
Rosana Fernandes, 43, whose
sister, brother-in-law and two
young nieces were buried under
the mud
Holding a faded photo of the
smiling family, she didn't both-
er holding back the tears as she
explained what it is that leads
families to live atop a landfill

FELIPE DANA/AP
Residents remove belongings from their damaged home after heavy rains and landslides in the Caixa D'agua area in Niteroi,
Brazil on Wednesday.

"Yes, it was a dump. But peo-
ple are desperate to have a home
anywhere," she said. "What else
were they going to do? Where else
were they supposed to go? This is
our reality. They knew the risks,
but when you have no money, you
have no choice," she said.
Rio officials said they are going
to step up forced evictions of slum
residents living in at-risk areas.
Mayor Eduardo Paes announced
that 1,500 families are going to be
removed from their homes in at
least two Rio slums, and that more
evictions are likely.
Officials from Rio state's Civil
Defense department said that at
least 14,000 people were forced
from their homes by the mud-

slides and that potential slides
threatened at least 10,000 other
houses in the city.
Yesterday, scores of rescue
workers poked at the massive
mountain of earth that slid down
the hills of the Morro Bumba slum
toward a paved road in Niteroi,
Rio's sister city of 500,000 people
across the Guanabara Bay.
Mounds of soil and garbage
rose 40 feet (12 meters) high. A
dozen dump trucks were lined
up to carry off the debris. Hun-
dreds of onlookers watched as
firefighters carried at least four
coffins out of the crater created
by the slide.
Homeless residents soughtshel-
ter in two Evangelical churches

just down the road from the slum,
where water, food and clothing
were handed out. Small children
played and slept on dozens of mat-
tresses laid out on church floors.
Niteroi recovery operations
were moving slowly: The wet,
steep terrain posed a continued
threat to anyone trapped in the
wreckage and to emergency crews
as well, said lead firefighter Alves
Souza.
"The work isvery intense, given
the fact that the volume of mate-
rial we have here is very large,"
Souza said.
While it rained only lightly
Thursday, the forecast was for
heavier rains later in the day and
throughout the weekend.


RALLY
From Page 1
to sexual violence, the rally then
turned into a march throughout
downtown Ann Arbor and con-
cluded with a candlelight vigil back
on the Diag.
Ann Arbor Mayor John
Hieftje,spoke during the opening
remarks of the rally about the prev-
alence of sexual assault in the city
and on campus.
"Every year, we have about 30
cases of criminal sexual assault,"
Hieftje said. "The more we educate
people about this, the more we can
bringthat number down."
Keynote speaker Jennifer
Pasquale, a prevention education
specialist, spoke about her daugh-
ter's struggle to recover after being
sexually assaulted. Sheurged those
in attendance to be open to listen-
ing to friends and family who may
be in need after such a situation.
"When someone comes to you
and says, 'Something happened
and it doesn't feel right and I feel
ashamed,' listen to them and sup-
port them," Pasquale said.
It is especially important to be
aware of victims' differing needs
during their recovery, Pasquale
said.
"It doesn't help if we silence the
victim," she said. "It's okay to talk
about it, or to not talk about it."

according to Schwider.
Ann Arbor resident Karaten
Birge said she has been volunteer-
ing with Take Back the Night for
the past few years, and handed out
programs at last night's rally.
"I am a survivor (of sexual
assault), and I'm really passion-
ate about getting the word out,"
Birge said. "I feel this is important
because it's something people don't
want to talk about."
Pasquale highlighted the fact
that one out of every four women
and one out of every 33 men are
sexually assaulted, and stressed
that all people have the right to be
protected from sexual violence.,
"We all have equal value in our
relationships, nomatter what we're
wearing, no matter what we're
drinking, no matter what party we
go to," Pasquale said.

Many of the attendees were sur-
vivors of sexual assault themselves
and wore teal armbands to identify
themselves.
Engineering junior Amanda
Sosne said volunteering with Take
Back The Night and attending the
event has been a meaningful expe-
rience because of a personal inci-
dent.
"My friend was involved in
(the rally) last year, and after I
was attacked, it made sense to get

"Some people really get alot out
of helping others, out of knowing
they're notalone and talking to oth-
ers who have the same problems,"

A timely donation
Students should give back to their community
U niversity students have relatively little to worry about
most of the time beyond the next exam. But that isn't
the reality for many Michigan residents, 14.4 percent of
whom live below the poverty line as of 2008, according to statis-
tics by the U.S. Census Bureau. Fortunately, community service
organizations attempt to combat social problems with the help
of volunteers. And students are prime candidates to volunteer.
Organizations like the Detroit Partnership have launched initia-
tives that provide easy, accessible opportunities for students to
give back to their communities. And with many options available
that require little time and no cash, students should take advan-
tage of opportunities to give back to the state.

Redefining the elite

On Saturday, the University students
participated in the 11th annual Detroit
Partnership Day. The Detroit Partnership
pairs University student volunteers with
schools, churches and community groups
in Detroit to aid efforts to restore and
improve the city. During this year's Detroit
Partnership Day, 1,000 students worked
at 30 sites around the city to demolish
abandoned homes, clean parks and paint
murals. This year's Detroit Partnership
Day put 200 more students to work than
last year's event.
Most students are sheltered from the
most adverse effects of the current econom-
ic recession by attending college instead of
entering the labor market. Students should
utilize opportunities provided by organi-
zations like the Detroit Partnership to take
a day to learn about and donate time to
local communities. It is encouraging to see
that the participation rates have hit new
highs this year, but the need for volunteers
is as high as ever. But students are in a key
position to help Michigan communities.
With opportunities for service so varied in
time commitment, cause and activity, stu-
dents should be able to find the time and
the organization with which to volunteer.
Help need not take the form of monetary
donations or giving clothes and posses-

sions to charity. For students who often
don't have extra cash, donating a few hours
instead of a few bucks to service organiza-
tions is an easy way to connect with the
community and help others. This can take
the form of tutoring at a local school a cou-
ple of times a week or spending a few hours
volunteering at a shelter or food bank.
These opportunities can utilize students'
skills - or simply their spare time - to
make a big difference for real people and
the community.
The Detroit Partnership is just one orga-
nization that facilitates easy access to ser-
vice opportunities. There is a rich array
of volunteer and service organizations
to choose from ranging from cleaning up
parks to mentoring children without stable
role models. On Maize Pages alone, stu-
dents can find a list of 140 organizations
devoted to community service, many of
which allow them to experience first-hand
the problems afflicting those not protected
by the University's ivory towers.
Opportunities for service are plenti-
ful, and the variety of options on campus
makes giving back to the community easy,
accessible and affordable. Students should
take advantage of their removal from the
labor market to help those most damaged
by its collapse.

William F. Buckley, founder
of the conservative news
magazine National Review,
said he'd rather be
governed by the
first 2,000 people
listed in the Boston
phonebook than
by the faculty of
Harvard Univer-
sity, having more
faith in the com-
mon man than the
intellectual elite. LIBBY
Recently, I've heard ASHTON
liberals empathize
with that senti-
ment, recognizing
the failure of some of society's most
intellectually prestigious institutions.
Typically divided, members of the
electorate are united in their disillu-
sionment with the current system of
determiningsociety's leadership.
But when I hear people complain
about the unwarranted control of the
intellectual elite, I wonder what qual-
ities they would look for in choosing
the leaders of finance, government
and business. History has shown us
that wealth, social status and political
connectedness shouldn't be among
them. Beyond that, I'm not sure how
useful history is in telling us where to
look for leaders because the terrain
of the 21st century is vastly different
than anything before it.
As the next generation of society's
leaders, our well-roundedness will
have to surpass that of the genera-
tions before us. Many of the qualities
that will be necessary for success
in this next phase of American life
haven't been necessary before. It
seems as though the game is chang-
ing so we should learn the rules
before we're thrown into it.
I suppose intelligence - at least
the kind we traditionally measure
through the system of higher edu-
cation - doesn't necessarily equip
someone with the potential to lead.
Many of the Wall Street brokers,
whose financial irresponsibility
and lack of foresight facilitated the
nation's worst economic downturn

since the depression, hold fancy
diplomas from top universities.
So should we value a high emo-
tional intelligence over book smarts?
After the 2008 election, New York
Time columnist Maureen Dowd con-
trasted President Barack Obama's
role as "the Convener" to Presi-
dent George W. Bush's role as "the
Decider." She celebrated Obama's
self-deprecating allowance of others'
expertise to guide his decision-mak-
ing. Even if our leaders don't have
all the answers, we want them to be
socially competent enough to work
together and figure them out. Hope-
fully, public policy students learned
something from Congress's nearly
debilitating reluctance to compro-
mise on the health care bill.
The emotional intelligence of our
leaders is also important insofar as it
strengthens their resolve to work for.
the betterment of all people. Lead-
ers of finance must strike a balance
between the moral integrity that pre-
vents their succumbing to greed and
the ambition for profit that promotes
economic growth. Our business
school graduates should look for-
ward to being celebrated for enhanc-
ing widespread prosperity, not being
sneered at for playing the market
game to their advantage.
Daniel Pink, an alumnus of myhigh
school and author of The New York
Timesbestseller"AWholeNewMind,"
suggests that we're transitioning away
from the "Information age" and into
the "Conceptual age," wherein a per-
son's ability to create will be valued
over a person's ability to calculate.
According to this picture of the future
in which the most innovative people
will be the most successful, maybe we
should have more creative expression
requirements than natural science
requirements at the University.
Those who stick with the natu-
ral sciences will be responsible for
restructuring society's treatment of
the environment. As the green move-
ment becomes less politicized, the
most successful industries will be
those that are the least environmen-
tally disruptive. Alternative energy

research is valued for its potential to
drastically enhance American self-
sufficiency, along with its environ-
mental benefits. Innovation in the
sciences is crucial to the success of
almost every facet of our society.
If technology continues developing
at the same pace as it did over the last
decade, computer science will likely
become more commonplace than nat-
ural science. I expect the professions
that are now considered the most
lucrative - medicine and law - to
become less attractive in comparison
to computer engineering. They'll be *
making the most money while work-
ing for forward-thinking companies
that function more like workplace
playgrounds than offices.
Leaders need to *
have more than
just intelligence.
The technological leap forward has
carried us into a globalized world.
Business executives will be work-
ing regularly face-to-face with their
international counterparts, as Skype
becomes the new conference call. Not
only will knowledge of foreign lan-
guages become a crucial element of
success, but cultural awareness will
as well. We'll have to take strides
away from the narcissism that's soiled
America's image internationally.
Criticisms of the intellectual elite
got me thinking about what quali-
ties should be valued in the leaders
of society. Although I maintain that
intelligence is among those qualities,
the others are equally as important.
If creativity, social consciousness
and personal integrity are the deter-
mining factors of Harvard's future
faculty members, maybe Bill Buckley
would prefer them to the phonebook.

The evolution of Pakistan


For a country of its geopolitical stature, Pak-
istan remains a mystery to Western nations.
On campus, there is little discussion of Paki-
stan outside of history classes, even at a time
when the United States is aligning itself ever
closer to the country. For those who view it
from the lens of the international media, Paki-
stan is a land of religious extremism, perpetual
violence, nuclear proliferation and the root of
global terrorism. But Pakistani students on
campus urge others to look at the nation closer
and seea country exploring values like democ-
racy and judicial independence and evolving a
progressive culture - exhibited by an interna-
tionally acclaimed cast of writers, musicians
and filmmakers.
To understand Pakistan, one need not rec-
oncile these alternating views but instead view
the trajectory of its character from an orphan
of colonial India to the nuclear-armed state
of today. While many blindly term it a terror-
ist state, Pakistani students argue otherwise.
They see Pakistan as a complicated country
of 170 million people, divided along ethnic,
linguistic, political and economic lines. It is a
country yet to settle on being a secular state -
as envisioned by its founder - or a religious one
the successive politicians found more conve-
nient. More importantly, it has yet to decide on
its system of governance. Its 63 years have been
divided among military dictators and civilian
democrats - all of whom nurtured a ruling
elite that manipulated the masses and shaped a
policy that served their own interests.
These trends shape the country's fragile, but
increasingly crystallized, identity. It is national-
ist and conservative in terms of country and reli-
gion. Beyond that, it is diverse and pluralistic,
best personified by the 70-plus television chan-
nels that brew a mixture of political talk shows,
Hollywood movies and religious programs.
Crucially, Pakistan's identity is becoming
more assertive, perhaps as a result of a grow-
ing comfort with its unique nature or with the
perceived injustice that the country feels was
meted out from the West. Today, Pakistanis
criticize the Taliban's brutality, the incom-
petence and corruption of successive govern-
ments and discrete American operations in
their country with equal measure. A dichotomy
has emerged: The ruling class looks to the West
for support while the lower classes insist focus
should shift to domestic problems like electric-
ity shortages and education reform.
The only thing more complicated than this
dichotomy is the actual relationship between

Pakistan and the U.S. During the Cold War era,
Pakistan nestled itself in the American camp,
using the relationship as a defensive hedge
against India. However, just as the Soviet dis-
integration signaled a completion of the United
States' short-term interests in the region, the
marriage was over. The military hardware and
billions of dollars of aid were replaced with
suffocating sanctions and international isola-
tion during the 1990s.
Sept. 11, 2001 changed all of that. Pakistan
was recalled to reprise its role as the weapon of
choice during George Bush's 'War on Terror.'
However, two things were different this time.
First, the enemy in the region was the Taliban,
an entity Pakistan had nurtured to protect
its interests in the region during its isolation
phase. And second, the Pakistani generals, who
ran the country at the time, had learned a thing
or two from the time when the Americans had
'deserted' them. They played a delicate dance,
differentiating between the Taliban who were
on their side and those they felt were dispens-
able. The reward was more than $18 billion in
military and civilian aid, which jumpstarted
a fast but uneven economy. The price was the
development of a domestic insurgency, fueled
by an irate section of the Taliban who felt Paki-
stan had sold them out.
Today, Pakistan stands at the crossroads.
The three major issues it needs to tackle are
how to reconcile its infant democratic project
with the burgeoning economic crisis, counter
its domestic insurgency while controlling the
ungovernable parts of the country and deal
with the U.S. At stake is the potential of 170
million people and the peace and security of
the international community.
This Saturday in Hutchins Hall, for the first
time in Ann Arbor, speakers from across the
country will come together to discuss Pakistan
and its relationship with the United States. Pre-
sented by the Pakistani Students Association
on campus, the 2010 University of Michigan
Pakistan Conference provides a window into
multiple issues,. initiating dialogue and debate
between students and experts in the field. My
hope is that this knowledge will enable stu-
dents to forge a more objective understanding
of a country so critical to American foreign
policy at this time and provide future leaders
greater context as they influence policy related
to Pakistan and other developing countries.

Get out of my Facebook

Sitting in my economics lecture hall, I couldn't help but
be irritated by the flashing Facebook pages in front of me.
Let's face it, Facebook is what gets us through our lec-
tures. It's the first page we open each morning and the last
one we exit. But hearing about a friend's death through
someone's Facebook status about a week ago shattered all
my illusions of the purpose of using it. In this age, com-
munication in the form of social networks has increased,
engulfing most people and beckoning the rest into a world
of gossip, drama and pretension. But while many look at
this blessed monstrosity as a way of keeping in touch, I
see the idea of privacy fly out the window.
Facebook is definitely the premier source of news for
many of us. Status messages like "Earthquake in Haiti,"
"Manchester United fails yet again," etc. make me Google
this information and help keep me updated with what's
happening in the world. But a status publicly announcing
grief over the death of a friend is an insensitive move that
is surprisingly accepted as commonplace among Face-
book users. This is one case where I wish I had received
the phone call before the declaration on Facebook.
There are more common instances of tactlessness and
drama on Facebook. For about a month, I watched two
friends exchange wall posts filled with romantic declara-
tions and things that made me blush. The couple even met
through Facebook. It's not that Facebook doesn't provide
us with enough options to have private, personal con-
versations. Everyone just chooses to talk about intimate
affairs in public instead.
It is also replacing text as the more insensitive way to
send invitations, apologize and even to break up. I could
not think of a better way to end a relationship with a jerk
that cheated on me than to simply declare my relationship
status as single and unfriend him. But that isn't a mature
way to end a real relationship.
Facebook has become a channel for users to broadcast
their social networks without being judged as boastful.

Whoever said popularity was only important in high school
was absolutely wrong. Facebook has reinforced the occur-
rence of high school cliques - but on a global level. Even
parents have begun to engage in the "who is more popular"
game. It's all about the number of friends, the number of
pictures, the wall posts, etc. We have essentially built an
alternate personality in this subtlety-deprived network.
And let's consider profile stalking - a creepy but fun
way of passing time. It is easy for anyone to follow a per-
son's life through their Facebook profile. Just consider
the claims of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls
Gaza, which believes that personal information on Face-
book is making it easier for Israelis to recruit the perfect
spies for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Through a look
into the personal life and issues of users plastered all over
Facebook, one can see why it wouldn't be hard to build reli-
able profiles of people and lure them into working as spies.
But there's the direct threat of Facebook stalking as
well. About a month ago, 17-year-old Ashleigh Hall added
a stranger without knowing his true identity.After posing
as a 17-year-old boy, he turned out to be her 33-year-old
sex offender and murderer. It is mistakes like these that
cost dearly. It is a matter of not accepting friend requests
from unknown people, regardless of whom they say they
are. But however much we stress this issue, social net-
working sites still provide us with a weapon that we can
easily turn on ourselves if not used responsibly.
Facebook is definitely one of the innovations that has
defined the 21st century so far. But all it requires is a little
bit of responsible use, so that we don't lose ourselves in
this fabricated, virtual world. Let's keep with Facebook's
purpose of reinforcing our social life, not defining-it. As
for me, sure, I feel a little bit of resentment and disgust
towards Facebook right now, but I know I will soon get
over it and continue to build my cyber image.

'12' jurors take
the stage tonight

A stage adaptation of
'Twelve Angry Men'
0 keeps its made-for-
the-screen feel
By BRAD SANDERS
DailyArts Writer
Though the arduous experience
of jury duty isn't something that
many people
want to experi-
ence, Basement
Arts's new play, Tonight at 7
"12," makes p.m. and 11 p.m.,
the experi- tomorrow
ence actually a7 p.m.
enjoyable. TheS
director, LSA SDtudio Ore Waigreen
drcoLA Drama Center
senior Lincoln Free
Boehm, adapt-
ed it from the
original teleplay "Twelve Angry
Men"by Reginald Rosewith chang-
es that allowed for a co-ed cast.
The show follows 12 white
jurors who must decide whether
a black man is guilty of patricide.
They immediately vote guilty, with
the exception of one juror who con-
vinces the others to think logically
and put their prejudices aside.
"Something that's really cool
about this play, more. so than
any other play, is that there is an
immense transformation of each
character from the first to last
page," said Boehm, who is also an
opinion columnist for the Daily.
"When they first come into the
juror's room they know nothing
about each other, but they develop
these unique relationships that are
very telling about who they are."
Each juror retains an air of ano-

nymity as none are ever named -
only numbered - throughout the
production.
Thomas Wolfson, a Music,
Theatre & Dance senior who plays
Juror 4, commented on his char-
acter's contributions to the group
dynamics.
"I play a man who is less guided
by his emotions and more by his
intellect," Wolfson said. "It's sort of
myfunctiontobethevoiceofreason
in many circumstances, although I
do believe the boy is guilty."
Boehm has been passionate about
this play since high school, when he
picked it for a reportsimply because
it was first alphabetically.
"I sat down with it one night
not really knowing what I was
getting myself into, and then an
hour and a half later my eyes were
glued to the text," Boehm said. "I
think it's a really captivating play
and it's something that draws the
audience in."
Having worked in television,
Boehm has done well in translat-
ing what was originally a television
production into a staged play.
"I've worked for Conan O'Brien
for the past two years, and have had
experience working with directors
in television," Boehm said. "The
staging and everything in '12' has
more of a producing-for-film-and-
television feel to it than the stage.
That's an exciting thing about
showing it here, very few have seen
'Twelve Angry Men' produced
onstage."
According to Wolfson, the cast
of "12" is composed of some of the
most talented students in the Uni-
versity's Performance BFA program
including Joey Richter, a School of
Music, Theatre, & Dance junior
who performed in previous Base-

ment Arts productions "Me and My
Dick" and "A Very Potter Musical."
"This is one of the most excel-
lent casts I've seen assembled in the
Basement Arts program. I think a
lot of people will realize that - that
super group of actors," Wolfson
said. "There's a lot of actors in the
cast that I've known for many years,
so we can sort of all finish each oth-
ers sentences and can predict each
other's moves."
"While the cast is upperclass-
man-heavy, we do have freshmen
and sophomores too," Boehm added.
"It is a diverse cast, and they have
made my job as a director that much
easier. A lot of these people have put
their egos aside to take smaller sup-
porting roles, just because of the
opportunity to work with everyone
that is in this show."
WhileStudio One ofthe Walgreen
Drama Center may not always be the
ideal set for multiple-setting plays, it
has worked very well for "12."
"As far as representing a claus-
trophobic jury room in real time,
I thought it was perfect," Boehm
said. "There will also be filmed
aspects in the show, so it's kind of
a multimedia production. We've
got a very strong set that (has) been
designed from grants that we've
gotten, which not many Basement
shows can do."
One thing that Boehm is sure of
is that the audience members will
not be checking their phones con-
stantly to see when they can leave.
"You don't want people to come
see a show and wish they weren't
there. This is a show I'm 100 per-
cent confident people aren't going
to be sitting there wondering when
it's ending," Boehm said. "They will
be engrossed in the storyline, and
it's going to hit them hard."

A .wonderful 'Life'

By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Senior Arts Editor
BBC and Discovery changed
the television world with "Planet
Earth." This
nature docu-
mentary took us
where no other Lie
cameras had pre-
viously gone. It Sundays at
captured incred- 8 p.m-
ibly rare and Discovery
awe-inspiring
natural moments
on only the best HD cameras, and
most important, it destroyed the
stigma plaguing nature shows
everywhere: that they're boring
and didactic. With the critical
acclaim and popularity of "Plan-
et Earth," BBC and Discovery
teamed up once more to bring us
"Life."
"Life" doesn't really differ much
from "Planet Earth," but why mess
with a good thing? While "Earth"
would center each episode in a
stunning location (deserts, caves,
etc.), "Life" allows for an in-depth
look at unique plants and animals
with each installment focusing on
different types of life (future epi-
sodes are titled "Plants," "Insects"
and "Hunters and Hunted").
Oprah Winfrey offers her voice
for the narration, replacing Sigour-
ney Weaver, who narrated "Earth."
Winfrey's narration is subtle and
not recognizable. It fits appropri-
ately with the BBC/Discovery vibe
- she doesn't give out free stuff or
promote a book club, which might
actually be a downer depending
on how you look at it. Those who
were die-hard fans of David Atten-
borough's calming voice on the UK
version of "Earth" will be pleased
to know his soft British accent has
returned for the British version of
"Life" as well.
"Life" follows the precedent set
by "Earth" of having nothing less
than absolutely stunning footage.
The high-definition, slow-motion
shot of a chameleon extending its
long, sticky tongue to capture a
praying mantis could be replayed
at least 50 times before getting old.
Also following "Earth," each hour-

long episode ends with a 10-minute
short "Life on Location" detailing
the efforts behind obtaining this
spectacular footage. Showing the
great lengths to which the crew
went makes the series even more
impressive.
"Life" attempts to narrow down
the broad subject matter of "Plan-
et Earth," but it doesn't exactly
achieve its goal. The overarching
theme of the episode titled "Chal-
lenges of Life" could be applied to
any living thing. And so, especially
in the first episode, the segments
didn't feel nearly cohesive enough.
The premiere episode alone fea-
tures bottlenose dolphins, chee-
tahs, killer whales, crabeater seals,
tufted capuchins, flying fish, Venus
flytraps, hippos, strawberry poi-
son-dart frogs, giant octopi, chin-
strap penguins, stalk-eyed flies
and ibexes. Each organism could
have had its own episode dedicated
to documenting the extraordinary

challenges it faces, so the few min-
utes each received was nowhere
near enough.
Though perhaps that's what
keeps "Life" fresh and entic-
ing. It's clear the show will never
spend an entire hour on some-
thing mundane; the alternative
Oprah narrates
in Discovery's
new nature epic.
is a bombardment of incredible
images detailing the fantastic phe-
nomenon of life. "Life" definitely
lives up to the precedent set by its
original series, but after a success
like "Planet Earth," it doesn't seem
possible for BBC and Discovery to
do much wrong.

A divine comedy
from Basement Arts

By SHARON JACOBS
Assistant Arts Editor
This week, Basement Arts
wants you to "Raise the Praise."
After playing two shows at Eastern
Michigan
University,
"Altar Boyz"
will take Tonight and
the stage tomorrow at 9 p.m.,
at the Wal- Sunday at S p.m.
green Drama
Center this Walgreen Drama Center
Friday. Free
The show
is a musi-
cal spoof about a fictitious Chris-
tian boy band of the same name.
It follows the Altar Boyz as the
band sings and dances its way
through the last stop on its "Raise
the Praise" world tour. But with a
poppy '90s five-piece headlining
in a Jesus-centric world, this is no
everyday concert.
"(In the musical) Sony has spon-
sored this machine that reads
the souls in the audience - how
many souls are lost and are in sin,"
explained Erik Heitz, the Music,
Theatre & Dance senior directing
"Altar Boyz."
"As the show goes, the Boyz'
goal is - through their teachings,
through the lessons, the things
they've learned in Bible school,
through the songs that they wrote
and stories they tell - to get that
number down and down and
down," he added.
The show pokes friendly fun at
both religion and '90s pre-teen cul-

ture - particularly appropriate for
the college-aged set.
"We all grew up with *NSYNC
and Backstreet Boys and 98, and all
the girls goo-gooed and gaahed and
all the guys pretended to hate it, but
actually secretly at home knew all
the songs," Hietz said.
Music, Theatre & Dance junior
Eric Maier confessed his preference
for *NSYNC as a youth.
"I feel like now (boy bands are)
retro," Maier said. "My friend's in a
band and when they play house par-
ties they'll always throw in one old-
school boy band number, and that's
the number that brings down the
house, because everyone just is like,
'This was my childhood."'
Maier plays Abraham, the "quiet
Jewish boy trying to fit into the
(Christian) boy band."
The Altar Boyz' only non-Cath-
olic, Abraham was recruited to the
group after writing a term paper
for bandmate Luke. But regardless
Boy bands and
Bibles collide at
Walgreen.
of how much religion dictates the
Altar Boyz' motivation, each mem-
ber of the Altar Boyz has his own
boy-band persona.
"Luke wears a lot of ghetto gear
because he's kind of the rapper out
of the gang, and then Matthew is like

the 'heartthrob,' so he's in a tank top
and a bandana," said Cody Davis, a
Music, Theatre & Dance junior.
Davis's character, Juan, was left
on the steps of a church-in Tijuana
as a baby and was raised by nuns.
"The nuns taught (Juan) the
ways of the Bible and how to speak
with a Spanish accent," Davis said.
Mark, the band member of
ambiguous sexual orientation,
"sings a song called 'Epiphany,'
where you think he's going to
come out of the closet, but he actu-
ally confesses that he's a Catholic,"
Davis added.
Heitz said that the show is "very
farcical and it does spoof a lot of
things," but it shouldn't offend the
religious.
"I grew up in Oklahoma, in the
Bible Belt," Davis said. "I still go to
church today, and I love this show. I
think it's hysterical."
Adding to the silly humor is the
synchronized choreography in the
production - all of which, like the
acting and directing, is organized

ed challenge Tickets from $3
(amongothers,
like rehearsing over Groove) helped
to get its production of Tennessee
Williams's "Orpheus Descending"
up to the caliber for which it strove.
The Rude Mechanicals will grace
the stage of the Lydia Mendelssohn
Theatre starting tonight.
Although the actionof"Orpheus"
takes place in an unnamed Missis-
sippi town in the script, director
Kacie Smith, a junior in the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance, was
most interested in emphasizing
that this town is Hell.
"The design elements create a
strange, unrealistic environment
in which these characters move
and live," Smith wrote in an e-mail
interview. "They are never aware
that they are in Hell, but every
character is there for a reason."
"Orpheus" follows a group of
characters, each faced with a set of
oppressions that create his or her
own personal Hell. For instance,

For Saturday, April 10, 2010
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
This is a lovely, feel-good day. You
can enjoy the company of others, or you
can enjoy your own company. Either
way, you'll be happy.
TAURUS
(April 20to May 20)
Conversations with others, especially
female acquaintances, will be particu-
larly warm and friendly today. In fact,
new love could begin for some of you.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
People in authority will notice you in a
favorable way. You look good to them in
their eyes. (You might want to turn this
to your advantage.)
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
Travel experiences or a chance to
explore taking a course, further training
or higher education will please you
today. It could lead to increased earnings
or a chance to travel more!
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Romance with your boss or someone
older, richer or more established might
begin today. Or this person might share
something with you. (This is an interest-
ing day.)
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Today, you'll feel inspired by arts and
crafts or the creativity of other people -
especially those from other cultures.
Enjoy literature, travel and discussions
about philosophy and political ideas.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
This is a pleasant day at work or when
dealing with clients, co-workers and
whoever you bump into in general.
People are easily cooperative and

friendly today. And so are you.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Romance, sports, the arts and playful
activities with children are all wonderful
sources of enjoyment today. Get out and
do something that's fun!
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22to Dec. 21)
This is a lovely day to entertain at
home. Invite friends and family over.
People are ready to have a good time and
share food, drink and ideas.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Accept all invitations. Interaction with
others will be stimulating today. This is
not the day to stay at home; get out and
do something different!
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 18)
Trust your moneymaking ideas,
because they just might pay off!
Discussions with others about new jobs
or ways to earn money are profitable.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
This is definitely a feel-good day for
you. Not only do you feel sympathetic
and warm toward others, you're also
playful, prankish and flirtatious! Laugh
it up!
YOU BORN TODAY Like many
Aries, you are heroic. You are quick to
defend the cause of others who need
your help. You like doing this because
you can demonstrate to the world how
bold and daring you are! (You never
back down from a fight.) It's important
to find a job or a path in life that you
love. This next year might be one of the
most powerful years of your life. Dream

don't include layoffs," Sullivan
said at the time. "But we're a very
decentralizedplace, and what we
end up doing is giving each unit a
budget, and they have to live with-
in that budget."
Though Sullivan couldn't guar-
antee that no lecturers would
be laid off due to the decentral-
ized nature of the University, she
said officials would look for other
! options for cutting costs before
laying off lecturers.
"I would say that we are a
human capital organization, and
the reason we don't look at lay-
offs first is that when we lay peo-
ple off we don't just cut costs, we
cut assets," Sullivan said at the
time. "That's not something that
we want to do, but there aren't a
lot of places to cut in many pro-
grams."
In an interview, Joe Walls,
adjunct associate professor, who
acts as spokesperson for LEO, said
the purpose of the rally was to
make the group's struggles known
to the public. The rally's location
merited special attention from the
" administration, he said.
"I'm sure they're watching,"
Walls said. "I'm sure they're pay-
ing attention to what's happen-
ing."
Walls also said undergradu-
ates should attend the rally and
support the lecturers, as "what

downturn, Kyle Mazurek, vice
president of government affairs
at the Ann Arbor Area Chamber
of Commerce, said the city has
- managed to rise above the reces-
sion by working with the Uni-
versity to strengthen the town's
economy.
"(The University) is a substan-
tial economic engine in our com-
munity that we're very fortunate
to have," Mazurek said. "I think
that all communities across the
state are suffering to one degree
or another, but I think part of the
reason that Ann Arbor has been
able to weather the storm to a
certain extent is because we have
(the University) here to help prop
us up."
Mazurek noted that collabora-
tive programs between the city
of Ann Arbor and the University
as well as efforts to commercial-
ize the "top notch research that is
generated at the University" are
crucial in helping the city's and
the state's economies thrive.
He added that being a college
town is also something that sets
Ann Arbor apart from other cities
in the state.

"Not only do you have a really
great University that attracts
folks from all around, but you've
got, again, a good urban setting
that they want to live in," Mazu-
rek said.
Ann Arbor's drop from the
number one to the number four
spot in the per capita GDP rank-
ing is evident in the financial sit-
uations of some local businesses.
Bill Loy, owner of Campus
Student Bike Shop on Maynard
Street - which has been in busi-
ness for over 40 years - said
he has recently seen a drastic
decrease in sales that has forced
him to cut costs and reduce the

an overall policy change that will
alter the way the University struc-
tures its housing.
"It will make (housing) more
inclusive; make it easier for people
to have the living situation that
they want," Horky said.
It is possible that University
Housing officials will put together
a more complex survey as a follow-
up - based on the decisions of the
working group, according toHorky.

They are interested in seeing
how gender-neutral housing will
affect the University, and how
it might complicate the housing
application, Grieb said.
If officials create this survey, it
will be sent out next year, accord-
ing to Grieb.
As with any large policy change,
the gender-neutral housing propo-
sition will have a number of obsta-
cles, Horky said, though time may

also be a positive for the advo-
cates of gender-neutral housing,
as it will allow them to thoroughly
review the proposal.
"The results of the surveytell us
what we really know - it's a ques-
tion of how we're going to do it,"
Horky said.
Once a final resolution has been
drafted, it will be proposed to the
University's Board of Regents for
approval.


classes they take and who teaches
them and whether the classes are
offered at all."
LSA junior Jody Schechter,
who is also a member of Students
Organizing for Labor and Eco-
nomic Equality, said she came
to the rally not only because she
believes in the cause, but also
because she realizes how she is
impacted by the struggles of the
lecturers.
"I'm here because I believe
that my lecturers deserve fair pay
and because I realize how impor-
tant they are to my education,"
Schechter said.
Despite the fact that the lec-
turers were earlier urged not to
discuss the rally in their classes,
some lecturers brought students
from their classes.
In an article published in the
University Record on Wednesday,
University officials said discuss-
ing the contract negotiations in
class is a violation of state law and
the union's agreement with the
University.
"We believe it is damaging to
our students to divert class time
away from the curriculum and to
this labor dispute less than two
weeks before the end of classes,"
Associate Vice Provost Jeff Frum-
kin, senior director of Academic
Human Resources, said in the
article.
Sullivan echoed in the article
his sentiments, saying lecturers
should not engage in this "imper-
missible action" and instead "con-
tinue to devote their class time to
providing outstanding instruction

to their students during this busy
time."
In a speech at the rally, Rack-
ham student Lauren Squires,
grievance officer of the Graduate
Employees Organization, said her
group stands behind the goals of
LEO, just as they have done in the
past.
The rally also included speech-
es by supporters from Students
Organizing for Labor and Eco-
nomic Equality, the Huron Valley
Central Labor Council and Ameri-
can Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees.
Though contract negotiations
were at the forefront of the rally,
attendees also discussed Herold's
non-reappointment. According to
University officials, the decision
not to reappoint Herold was due
to performance issues that were
found in the midst of her remedia-
tion process.
In an interview after the rally,
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said the University
acted appropriately and in accor-
dance with the contract they have
with LEO and that the timing of
the non-reappointment was also
in line with the contract.'
"The personnel action has
nothing to do with the current
negotiations," Cunningham said.
Fred Veigel, president of the
Huron Valley Central Labor
Council, spoke to the crowd and
said his group can help LEO by
putting pressure on the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents to re-hire
Herold.
"We're going to push these

regents that we helped elect and
we're going to get to them to do
the right thing and reinstate this
person that they fired for no rea-
son," Veigel said.
LSA senior Joel Berger said
Harold's non-reappointment was
one of the main reasons he attend-
ed the rally.
"I think the fact that the Uni-
versity fired the VP of LEO dur-
ing contract negotiations is a little
shady," Berger said.
Near the end of the rally, Herold
stood above the cheering crowd
and said she won't accept her fir-
ing without protest.
"I am going to get angry and I
am going to fight it," Herold said.
"What they did was wrong and
they need to feel that a lot of peo-
ple think it's wrong."
The crowd then marched to the
English Department office on the
third floor of Angell Hall, yelling
slogans as they went.
Though today's march was
unplanned, Axelson said it may
have been more effective than
the march staged last Friday, as
no one was present in the office at
last week's demonstration.
"It seemed worthwhile to come
back when people might be pres-
ent to hear what we had to say,"
she said.
As the yelling quieted down and
people began to leave, Herold said
she is touched by the amount of
concern people showed for her at
the rally.
"This wasn't just about me, but
it's great to see all of the people
and get this support," she said.

number of employees.
"The economy is just way
down," Loy said. "The sales on
new bikes, used bikes and repairs
are all way down. It's the lowest
it's ever been in the last 40 years
in my opinion."
Similarly, Maurizio Grillo, co-
owner of New York Pizza Depot,
said in an interview that his busi-
ness has been struggling in the
faltering economy. Last April, the
South University Avenue NYPD
location closed its doors to allow
the business to focus its resourc-
es more on its other locations,
which include its East William
Street spot.
"If the economy was great, I
would've never left," Grillo told
The Michigan Daily last April.
"But faced with the harsh reality,
we thought it was the best thing
to do."
In a recent interview, Grillo
noted that NYPD only uses fresh
ingredients for its food, but that
the price of these products has
skyrocketed as the economy has
plummeted. He said this has
made it difficult to try to appease
the student body, as the business
hasn't been able to lower prices
recently.
"We are trying our best," Grillo
said.
Just as the University of Mich-
igan provides economic opportu-
nities for the city of Ann Arbor,
city officials from Minneapolis,
which ranked number one for Big
Ten towns in the 2008 report,
said the city's resilient economy
can, in part, be attributed to the
connections made between the
University of Minnesota and the
larger community.
Manager of Business Develop-
ment for the City of Minneapolis
Kristin Guild said she thinks the
University of Minnesota is an
important part of the city's eco-
nomic dynamic, as it provides
many jobs in the research sector.

Phil Park, business incuba-
tion manager of the Chamber of
Business and Industry of Cen-
tre County, said that Pennsylva-
nia State University has "a huge
impact" in terms of the city of
State College's economy, since it's
its largest employer.
Park said in the past, the city
has failed to establish a close
working relationship with the
university but said that this is
something it has been trying to
improve in recent years.
"We don't really have a strong
collaboration with the univer-
sity," Park said. "We're work-
ing on that now as a recruitment
effort. We are undergoing the
initial phase of collaborating for
the recruitment of businesses
that are in the industry cluster of
research and development, tech-
nology, chromotogoly and life
science - areas that Penn State is
very strong on."
Bill LaFayette, vice presi-
dent of economic analysis at the
Columbus Chamber of Com-
merce, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that the city's economy has
remained relatively stable over
the past several years, due, to a

certain extent, to the presence of
Ohio State University.
LaFayette wrote that OSU
plays a large role in establishing
competition between its indus-
tries, including transportation,
entertainment and tourism,
which helps the city grow eco-
nomically.
"The region has a clear under-
standing of the driver industries
of our regional economy - those
that help our region to grow and
thrive," he wrote. "These include
transportation and logistics,
business and financial services,
entertainment and tourism, and
segments of the manufactur-
ing sector. We have initiatives
to enhance the competiveness of
each of those; OSU is one of our
most important partners in these
initiatives."
LaFayette also said Colum-
bus's Attract and Retain pro-
gram, which works to connect
students with local employers
through internship opportunities
during their college careers to
help them network and find jobs
after graduation, is a major asset,
which helps the city retain OSU
students after graduation.

LaMarre's return from a broken
thumb. The Jackson native started
inleftfield againstCentral and went
1-for-3 with an RBI single in his
first batting action since February.
While he says he still isn't 100 per-
cent, his presence should still be a
boost to the Wolverines' lineup.
And after LaMarre's return, the
team appeared to dodge a bullet
concerning senior catcher Chris
Berset. The co-captain - who leads
Michigan with a.389 average and is
tied for the team lead with ten dou-
bles - exited the game Wednesday
after fouling a ball off his leg, but
appears to be fine and will likely still
start against the Boilermakers.
His and the rest of the Wolver-
ines' production will be needed
against Purdue's strong starters if
the team is to achieve its goal and
complete its first Big Ten sweep.

Rich Rodriguez's spread
offense may be predicated on
speed, but as any coach will tell
you, football games are won and
lost in the trenches.
An overlooked transition with
Rodriguez's arrival is the effect on
the offensive linemen within the
offense. Instead of blocking for
a power run game and pro-style
offense, the Wolverines had to
adjust to a quicker offense based.
on spreading defenses out and
effectively using team speed - a
far cry from the three yards and a
cloud of dust days of the past.
Entering the third year under
Rodriguez, Michigan's offensive
line is now getting comfortable
within the system's philosophy.
"We're hoping and expecting
them to be improved, because it's
year three," Michigan offensive
coordinator Calvin Magee said.
"We've got some returning guys
who have been through a lot of
game plays, a lot of game plays, a
lot of practice times. And the more
you do something, the more com-
fortable and better you get with it.
But we're very pleased with those
guys.
"And I think (they're) playing

since we've been here. It's fun to
see all of those guys feel confident
about it."

Sophomore centerfielder Bree Evans went 3-for-4 with five RBIl in the second game of Michigan's doubleheader against Indiana. The Wolverines won the game 14-1.
Blue sweeps Hoosiers in doubleheader,

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
To the No. 2 Michigan soft-
ball team, a doubleheader means
a chance to play 14 innings of
'Michi-
gan Soft- INDIANA 2
ball.' MICHIGAN 8
But
Michigan INDIANA 1
(5-0 Big MICHIGAN 14
Ten, 28-5
overall) needed just 12 innings on
Thursday, beating Indiana 8-2 in
game one before run-ruling them
14-1 after five innings in game
two.
"Playing a doubleheader, you
know what you were messing up
in the first game," sophomore cen-
terfielder Bree Evans said after the
game. "You're really driven to do
better in that'second game. If you
have a doubleheader, your energy
is up and you're more focused
right after, so it helps you succeed.
You know what the pitchers look
like and what they were throwing,
so you didn't lose anything by tak-
ing a break."
The Wolverines - who have

won seven straight games - had
the Hoosiers' number on Thurs-
day. In both games, Michigan
scored two runs in the top of the
first inning, sparking the offense
for the rest of the game.
Game one featured three multi-
run home runs by seniors Roya St.
Clair and Maggie Viefhaus and
junior Dorian Shaw. In game two,
the Wolverines scored 14 runs on
13 hits, most runs manufactured.
Regardless of how the team
crossed the plate, Michigan man-
aged to hit the ball well against
Indiana and translate hits into
runs.
"Scoring first sets the tone in
the top of the inning when we're
not the home team," St. Clair said,
"to get some runs across the board
for our pitchers to give them some
run support so they go out there
and know that the offense is help-
ing."
Taking the mound with the
lead in both games, the pitching
duo of junior Jordan Taylor and
senior Nikki Nemitz kept the
Hoosiers from mounting come-
backs. Even freshman pitcher
Stephanie Speierman saw one

inning of action in the second
game as Michigan had a comfort-
able 13-run lead.
Controlling the tempo from the
get-go, the Wolverines combined
for 24 hits over both games in a
sustained offensive attack.
"We have a number of kids who
are capable, when they get a good
cut at the ball that are capable of
hitting it over the fence," Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins said.
"We are very capable of hitting
it out. We had a few occasions
where we got really good looks at
the ball.
"In the second game we were a
little scrappier but we still found a
lot of ways to score and we hit the
ball well. I like that we can hit for
average and hit for power, to me
it's a great combination."
The leadoff hitter, Evans, found
pop in her bat in the second game
against Indiana, going 3-for-4
from the plate with five RBI. At
the top of the order, Evans needed
to find ways to get on base for the
rest of the lineup to drive her in.
In the second game on Thursday,
the two, three, and four hitters
followed Evans' lead, each tally-

ing at least one RBL
"We're a good hitting team,"
Hutchins said. "We do a lot of
things every time we play. Some-
times we score early, sometimes
we score late, but the most impor-
tant aspect is that we score."
The offense lifted Michigan
to success on Thursday and the
team looks to keep the bats hot as
it travels to Minnesota this week-
end. With just 12 hours at home
before heading to St. Paul, the
Wolverines don't have long to pre-
pare for the weekend series.
"Right now we're going to have
to be in game mode," Hutchins
said. "We talked a lot about not
being complacent, and playing
hard and playing Michigan soft-
ball. I'm certain there are going
to be games that are closer. This
team has been through that,
they're tested.
"They've played a lot of great
teams already. Our goal is to not
let games be close. This team is
pretty talented and pretty senior
led, and I think that's how this
team works and that they should
be able to respond when there are
challenges in front of them."
