Seats in Spanish
and Communication
Studies fill too fast
By JENNIFER DOMINGUE
' Daily StaffReporter
Over the past few semesters,
students have faced increasing
difficulty enrolling in courses
required for their concentra-
tions. While the problem typi-
cally affects incoming freshmen
with low-credit standing, upper-
classmen in certain majors have
also been struggling to get a spot
in required courses.
University officials said reg-
istration difficulties are likely
due to increasing interest in
specific areas and a lack of gen-
eral resources in these depart-
ments, such as the departments
of Romance Languages and Lit-
eratures and Communication
Studies.'
Carin Scott, department man-
ager of the University's Depart-
mentofRomanceLanguages and
Literatures, said that because a
high volume of students always
try to register for foreign lan-

guage classes, those classes
typically fill up fast. But she said
that the Romance Languages
and Literature department is
accommodating and willing to
work with students if they have
scheduling conflicts.
"Students need to register as
early as possible," Scott said.
"We work with students indi-
vidually to try to ensure they
enroll in classes for their con-
centration."
Cristina Moreiras-Menor,
chair of the Department of
Romance Languages and Litera-
tures and an associate professor
of Spanish and Women's Stud-
ies, said registration problems
for Spanish classes are likely
growing due to limited resourc-
es and an increased interest in
the language.
Though students may have
issues registering for courses
they need to complete their
degrees, Moreiras-Menor
said she has never heard of an
instance in which a student's
graduation has been delayed
because of enrollment issues.

nationwide
By DAVID BUCCILLI
Daily StaffReporter
Many students are avid Wol-
verine fans, frequenting Univer-
sity sporting events to cheer on

the teams. But one group of Uni-
versity students has taken this
spectatorship to a new level.
About 30 students have
taken their game day viewing
experience to the small screen.
Through a collaboration with
the Big Ten Network over the
past year, a group of students
working with WOLV-TV has
broadcast live sporting events
at the University for observers

around the nation.
WOLV-TV - the University's
student-run television program
- entered a production agree-
ment with the Big Ten Net-
work's Student U productions
company last spring..
The University is the only Big
Ten school to develop entirely
student-run productions for
the network. LSA Senior Alex
Prasad, the general manager of

the program, said it's "cool, but
challenging" because every-
thing they do isself-taught.
Prasad works with three co-
producers and a group of stu-
dents to stream live sporting
events for the network's web-
site. The group covers about
60 sporting events during the
school year, and almost all of the
events are televised on the net-

Big House lights shine at night ,
as part of security protocol

Professor:
Lighting poses
miniumum harm
to environment
By JEREMY ARMAND
For theeDaily
Even though football season
has ended, lights still shine in
the Big House.
Michigan Stadium keeps
lights on in the stairwells and
club seating areas throughout

the year. While the practice
brings up an environmental
concern and question of fund-
ing, the practice is required for
security reasons, according to
University Athletic Department
spokesman David Ablauf.
It's stadium protocol to keep
the stadium lights on overnight
for "safety and security purpos-
es," he said.
"(Yesterday) for example,
when I came by at seven o'clock,
there (weren't) any lights on at
the stadium other than those
that were required by code to be
on," Ablauf said.

However, not all lights are
left on for security purposes.
As Ablauf explained, blue lights
that can be seen from a distance
are turned on at night for "aes-
thetic reasons."
In addition, lights are some-
times kept on during the day
for special events, Ablauf said.
Among recent events that
required lights were the intro-
duction of new head football
coach Brady Hoke and the
University's Hall of Honor
induction ceremony last week.

Clocks missing
from MLB, North
Quad lecture halls
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Though the minutes fly by in
University courses that are cap-
tivating, there are other classes

during which students anxious-
ly wait for the time to pass. And
the wait can be torturous for
students when there's no clock
to alert when class ends.
In response to a recent survey
about technology in which Uni-
versity students said they would
like to have clocks in more cam-
pus classrooms, LSA Student
Government and LSA officials
are making efforts to fulfill this

request.
LSA-SG conducted the sur-
vey in conjunction with LSA
Instructional Support Service
Undergraduate Technology last
semester. Out of the 835 stu-.
dents who answered the clock
question, 83 percent responded
that there should be clocks in
classrooms.

ban computers due
to distractions
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
Observers gazing into an
occupied lecture hall at the
University would most likely
see laptops aglow and hear the
sound of fingers tapping on

keysboards.
But, unless professors incor-
porate laptops into a course
curriculum, the devices may be
more distracting than helpful to
students, according to a forth-
coming study conducted by the
University's Center for Research
on Learning and Teaching.
Matthew Kaplan, managing
director of the CRLT, said the
study's findings indicate that if
instructors successfully imple-
ment laptops into their courses,

the computers can be learning
tools. When laptops are used in
class but not for specific class
purposes, Kaplan said they
serve as more of a distraction
due to online resources like
Facebook and email.
The data, which was collect-
ed from surveys asking Univer-
sity students how they felt about
the level of distraction laptops
cause in class, will be available
in a paper to be published by the

Immigration bill challenges
citizenship laws for children

Arizona rep. says
citizenship law
increases costs
PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona
lawmakers are again diving into
the national debate over illegal
immigration by proposing a bill
that challenges automatic U.S.
citizenship for children of illegal
immigrants.
The proposalyesterdaycomes
after Arizona last year enacted
one of the nation's toughest local
laws targeting illegal immigra-
tion.
Republican Rep. John Kava-
nagh, who filed the latest pro-
posal, said the goal isn't to get
every state in the union to enact
such a law, but rather to bring
the dispute to the courts in
hopes of reducing the costs asso-
ciated with granting automatic
citizenship.
"The result of that is they

University can also pay to use
the stadium for events like cor-
porate meetings, Ablauf said.
The lighting doesn't cost the
University any money since the
expense of Big House lights is
covered by a separate athletic
maintenance fund, according to
Ablauf.
During the football season,
stadium lights were kept on all
day for the catering and main-
tenance personnel who service
the facility.
Additionally, a permanent
lighting system for the field was
installed before The Big Chill

to full benefits, everything
from welfare to cheese, which
increases the costs to the states,"
Kavanagh said. "And beyond
that, it's irresponsible and fool-
ish to, bestow citizenship based
upon one's GPS location at birth."
This is the second time this
year that lawmakers in a state
have targeted the U.S. Constitu-
tion's 14th Amendment, which
guarantees citizenship to any-
one born in the U.S.
A similar proposal was filed
last week in the Indiana Gen-
eral Assembly by Republican
Rep. Eric Koch. Pennsylvania
state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, who
is leading the effort to get the
measure considered across the
country, said he hopes that law-
makers in 10 to 15 states will file
similar proposals this year.
Supporters of the proposal
argue that the wording of the
14th Amendment, which guar-
antees citizenship to people
born in the U.S. who are "subject
to the jurisdiction" of this coun-
at the Big House hockey game,
which was held on Dec.11.
The University's Board of
Regents unanimously approved
the $1.8 million installation at
its meeting in September.
"The addition of permanent
lights will improve the qual-
ity of viewing experience for
our fans," Athletic Director
David Brandon wrote in a press
release at the time.
The first night game will take
place on Sept. 10, 2011 against
Notre Dame.
Ablauf said these new lights
are currentlyused onbasketball
game days to help guide specta-
tors to Crisler Arena.
Raymond De Young, an asso-
ciate professor of conservation

try, doesn't apply to the children
of illegal immigrants because
such families don'towe sole alle-
giance to the U.S.
Opponents say the proposal
is mean-spirited toward immi-
grants, won't make a dent in the
state's immigration woes, and
will be declared unconstitution-
al by the courts.
Democratic Rep. Daniel Pat-
terson of Tucson, an opponent
of the bill, said the measure
will result in lawsuits and dis-
tract the state from focusing on
improvements to its hard-hit
economy. And, Patterson said, it
won't do anything to repair Ari-
zona's image.
"Bills like this that really
aren't going to go anywhere,"
Patterson said, "they are really
only goingto end up in court and
drive up litigation costs and give
us more of a bad reputation as
kind of a crazy state that I don't
think that most of the people in
this state agree with. It's just a
waste of time."
behavior at the University's
School of Natural Resources
and Environment, said while
the nighttime lighting has a
minimal impact on the environ-
ment, he's curious to see if the
University addresses the issue
from an environmental stand-
point.
"If it's brought up to their
attention, this is a nice sort of
mini-test of how serious they
take (environmental issues),"
De Young said.
According to Ablauf, the
Athletic Department is consci-
entious of environmental con-
cerns.
"We put an emphasis on try-
ing to conserve some energy,"
Ablauf said.

Egyptian activists protested for the third day ina row in response to social networking sites that called for a mass rally in Cairo
after Friday prayers. This was the country's largest anti-government protest inyears.
Hundreds activists
protest outsi'de Cairo

Rioters seek to oust
Egyptian president,
firebomb fire station
CAIRO (AP) - Violence esca-
lated in two cites outside the
capital Cairo yesterday where
anti-government protesters
torched a fire station and looted
weapons that they then turned
on police. Egypt's top democracy
advocate returned to the country
and declared he was ready to lead
the campaign to oust longtime
President Hosni Mubarak.
In the flashpoint city of Suez,
east of Cairo, witnesses said riot-
ers - some wearingsurgical masks
to ward off tear gas - firebombed
the main fire station and firefight-
ers jumped out windows to escape
the flames, as heavy black smoke
billowed from the building. In
the northern Sinai area of Sheik
Zuweid, several hundred Bed-
ouins and police exchanged live
gunfire, killing a 17-year-old man.
About 300 protesters surrounded
a police station from rooftops of
nearby buildings and fired two

RPGs at it, damaging the walls.
Social networking sites were
abuzz with talk that today's rallies
could be some of the biggest so far
calling for the ouster of Mubarak
after 30 years in power. Millions
gather at mosques across the city
for Friday prayers, providing orga-
nizers with a huge number of peo-
ple already out on the streets to tap
into.
Byyesterday evening, Facebook,
Twitter, cell phone text messages
as well as Blackberry Messenger
services were interrupted, possi-
bly a move by authorities to ham-
per protesters from organizing.
Egypt's ruling party said it was
ready for a dialogue with the pub-
lic but offered no concessions to
address demands for a solution
to rampant poverty and politi-
cal change heard in the country's
largest anti-government protests
in years. Safwat EI-Sherif, the
secretary general of the National
Democratic Party and a longtime
confidant of Mubarak, was dismis-
sive of the protesters at the first
news conference by a senior rul-
ing party figure since the protests
began.

"We are confident of our abil-
ity to listen. The NDP is ready for
a dialogue with the public; youth
and legal parties," he said. "But
democracy has its rules and pro-
cess. The minority does not force
its will on the majority."
The 82-year-old Mubarak has
not been seen in public or heard
from since the protests began
Tuesday with tens of thousands
marching in Cairo and a string of
other cities.
Mubarak has not said yet
whether he will stand for anoth-
er six-year term as president in
elections this year. He has never
appointed a deputy and is thought
to be grooming his son Gamal
to succeed him despite popular
opposition. According to leaked
U.S. memos, hereditary succes-
sion also does not meet with the
approval of the powerful military.
Mubarak has seen to it that no
viable alternative to him has been
allowed to emerge. Constitutional
amendments adopted in 2005 by
the NDP-dominated parliament
has made it virtually impossible
for independents like ElBaradei to
run for president.

tering," Moreiras-Menor said.
"They got into classes. This
semester we haven't received
any complaints."
According to Moreiras-
Menor, the Department of
Romance Languages and Lit-
eratures tries to be as accom-
modating as it can.
"In the context of our pos-
sibilities and our resources,
we try to cope. If we can open
classes, we do," Moreiras-
Menor said. "My impression is
we are placing the majority of
students in classes."
The Department of Romance
Languages and Literatures
isn't the only department in
which students have had.diffi-
culties registering for classes.
LSA sophomore Phoebe Barg-
houty said she has encountered
major issues trying to enroll in
Department of Communica-
tion Studies courses that are
already full.
"Because I am a first-year
student with sophomore stand-
ing, and I am trying to gradu-
ate early, it's hard to get all
my required courses because
I'm lower on the priority list,"
Barghouty said. "I got my first
two comm classes, 101 and 102,
by luck. Comm 211 was filled up
in just a couple days, so I had no
chance."
Planning a schedule becomes
frustrating, Barghouty said,
since she's not sure which
classes she'll be able to get into.
"I avoid waitlists," Bargh-
outy said. "I tend to choose the
classes that I want, then if they
are full, I just make a complete-
ly new schedule.".
The problems with register-
ing for required courses, Barg-
houty said, could stem from
students with other majors
enrolling in popular classes to
fill elective credits.
"In lots of cases, people are
just taking them for an elec-
tive, when people need them
for their major," Barghouty
said. "Sometimes I worry that I
won't be able to graduate early."

While some students are dis-
couraged from seeking enroll-
ment if a class has filled up,
others, like Public Policy senior
Michael Bertenthal, attempt to
get into the class by lobbying
professors.
"I think it's common for
students to have this problem,
but talking to professors really
helps," Bertenthal said. "Get-
ting on a waitlist, going to class
and discussing the opportunity
to take the class with the pro-
fessor works pretty well."
He added that registration
issues within other schools
at the University besides LSA
tend to be easier to resolve
since students can receive more
specialized help.
"If you are in a smaller
school, I think youhave a better
chance of getting into classes
you need," Bertenthal said. "I
was in LSA for two years before
I entered Public Policy. In LSA,
you are more anonymous and
dealing with advisers can be
more difficult when trying to
get into courses."
Though a number of stu-
dents pointed out flaws in the
registration process, students
said they had mixed feelings
about whether they would talk
to departments to express their
dissatisfaction.
Barghouty said she has sug-
gestions for improving regis-
tration within the Department
of Communication Studies, but
she wouldn't contact admin-
istrators with a grievance
regarding registration issues.
"I wouldn't file a complaint,"
Barghouty said "But I would
consider giving the comm
department some constructive
criticism."
Engineering freshman Alex
Nagler said his registration
problems for introductory
classes have been aggravating,
but he would rather handle the
situation on his own.
"It's impossible to get into
any 101 classes. Those should
be really easy to get into,"
Nagler said. "I would never
really consider taking it up with
the department. It's a nuisance,
but I can deal with it."

work a few days after they stream
online, accordingto Prasad.
Bruce Madej, the University's
associate athletic director for
special projects, is the liaison
between the University's Ath-
letic Department and the Big
Ten Network. He said though the
University doesn't have a broad-
casting program, a partnership
with the network provides a real-
world environment for students
to learn about broadcast journal-
ism.
"What has been really fun for
me is to be able to see individu-
als getting a background ina pro-
fession that they're interested in
and have fun while they're doing
it," Madej said. "It really is fun to
watch them."
The students mainly cover
home games of non-revenue
sports, including men's soccer
and baseball and women's soc-
cer, basketball and softball. This
year, they've covered all women's
home basketball games except
for last Sunday's matchup against
Purdue. Prasad said this cover-
age has been an important fac-
tor in increasing viewership of
women's sports at the University.
"That's an exposure wom-
en's basketball has never seen
before," Prasad said.
Though they did cover a few
men's basketball and ice hockey
games this year, Prasad said
students don't usually cover
football, basketball or hockey
because the Big Ten Network

typically covers them on their
own, using a satellite truck cost-
ingnearly $30,000.
To reduce the cost of using
the truck, the Big Ten Network
offers student producers at Big
Ten schools what they call "fly
packs" - production equipment
that connects the network and
the conference schools for data
sharing. This makes high qual-
ity production equipment more
accessible to student producers,
and it costs "infinitely less" than
using the satellite truck, Prasad
said.
Rex Arends, the director of
university technical operations
for the Big Ten Network, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
technology provides efficient,
high quality video footage and
facilitates open lines of commu-
nication between the schools and
the network.
"The bandwidth is huge, and
we can send true HD video down
it with very little compression,"
Arends wrote. "It also is bidi-
rectional, which means we can
receive video and communica-
tion from students working on
live sporting events and we can
communicate back to them and
oversee their production from
Chicago."
The technology allows stu-
dents to learn how to broadcast
sporting events in a professional
setting, he wrote.
"The students produce live
sporting events just like we do
at the network," Arends wrote.
"They produce, direct, run cam-
era ... from start to finish, includ-
ing play-by-play and analyst

announcers. They have learned
well how to do this and the prod-
uct continues to get better and
exceed expectations."
When Prasad and his crew first
started working with the net-
work last year, they were asked
to film six baseball and softball
events, which streamed online.
Once the students expressed
a desire to do more reporting,
Madej said he convinced the net-
work to let them produce more
games.
"Because of the passion the
students have for it, we really
have some of the best student
broadcasting on the Big Ten Net-
work," Madej said.
Arends said he is "continually
impressed" with the students'
broadcasts, especially since they
develop the programs on their
own.
"At most of the schools, we
have a video service liaison that
oversees the process," Arends
wrote. "At (Michigan), it is com-
pletely'run by students, and they
do an amazing job."
Though students aren't able
to take courses in broadcast
journalism at the University,
Prasad said working with the Big
Ten Network is a better learn-
ing experience than what is
offered by university broadcast
programs, like the one at Syra-
cuse University's S.I. Newhouse
School of Public Communica-
tions.
"Nowhere at Syracuse (Uni-
versity) can you say to the stu-
dents that their work is being
viewed in over 70 million house-
holds nationwide," Prasad said.



LAPTOPS
From Page 1
CRLT.
Currently, there isn't a Uni-
versity-wide policy specifying
rules or restrictions on laptop
use in class, so professors and
lecturers have the flexibility to
decide whether or not to allow
computer use.
Though laptops can side-
track students from course
material, the CRLT provides
University faculty and GSIs
training resources to help them
effectively incorporate laptops
in lectures.
Some faculty members have
started to use laptops interac-
tively in class in a similar fash-
ion to the iClicker, Kaplan said.
Instead of answering multiple
choice questions on an iClicker,
students type full responses to
questions which promotes crit-
ical thinking.
Kaplan said the laptops also
allow students to send messag-
es to their GSIs and ask ques-
tions that they would not have
a chance to ask in a large class-
room setting.
"The faculty member can
even have a sense of what's
confusing students," Kaplan
said. "What we found is when
laptops are used very intention-
ally that way, they're somewhat
less distracting, and students
feel more like it's contributing
to their learning."
Shazia Iftkhar, assistant
professor of Communications
Studies at the University, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
doesn't allow laptops in her
Communications 101 lecture or

in her smaller classes because
she feels they are a distraction
for students. Banning laptops
generates a more learning-ori-
ented environment, she wrote.
"We feel that not using lap-
tops allows students to listen
and engage in discussion in a
more focused way and to devel-
op critical and engaged note-
taking skills through active
listening," Iftkhar wrote.
With the proliferation of
portable technologies among
students, determining whether
or not to allow laptops in class
is something faculty have to
think about more than they did
10 years ago, Kaplan said.
"I think it's a question of
thinking carefully about what
your goals are and how the lap-
top might help you meet those
goals," he said. "Sort of what we
say about any technology tool,
which is it's a tool, and it should
be connected to your goals for
the class and for student learn-
ing."
LSA freshman Blake Mackie
took a class last semester in
which laptops were prohib-
ited. He said he thinks many
students understand why the
professor would choose not to
allow laptops in class, but it is
an inconvenience for students
who use their computer as a
way to take notes.
"It was my first semester,
and I wasn't allowed to use
laptops in any of my classes
actually, so that's what I was
used to," Mackie said. "I think
it was good because then
people weren't distracted
by Facebook and everything
that you see in all the classes
where you can use laptops."

CLOCKS
From Page 1
ager of LSA ISS, said students
who answered "yes" on the sur-
vey said they wanted more clocks
in classrooms because they can't
use personal electronic devices
during tests or because they don't
have cell phone reception in some
classrooms, which prevents them
from checking the time.
Some students who answered
"no" on the survey said they felt
clocks were distracting, while
others said the lack of clocks isn't
important enough to warrant
additional University funding.
"We recognize that we're not
going to make everybody happy,"
Dressler said. "But I think that,
particularly in spaces where there
are really large exams (that have)
high stakes, havingclocks for stu-
dents to be able to track their time
is really important."
Many small classrooms in
buildings including North Quad-
rangle Residential and Academic
Complex, the Dennison Build-
ing and the Modern Languages
Building don't have clocks. Put-
ting clocks in North Quad is a
priority because of the building's
poor cell phone reception,
Dressler said.
"Insomespaceswherethere
are not clocks, we may just be
able to work with the faculty
members who are working in
those spaces to be more cogni-
zant of student needs and the
fact that students don't wear a
lot of wristwatches anymore,"
Dressler said.
She said most of the Univer-
sity's auditoriums and class-
rooms that hold more than

100 people already have clocks.
However, she said many of these
clocks are in the back of the room,
and ISS is working to evaluate
whether the placement is effec-
tive for students or if more clocks
need to be added in the front of
these rooms.
There are also older clocks in
many of these classrooms that
may need to be replaced with the
wireless clocks, Dressler said.
Dressler said ISS plans to use
wireless clocks powered by trans-
mitters that she hopes will be
installed in LSA classrooms by
next fall.
Each transmitter costs about
$2,500, and each clock costs
about $200 and comes with
a battery that lasts about five
years. Though the plan is still
being evaluated, installation
time and licensing issues are
factors that will affect how
soon the clocks can be installed,
Dressler said.
Justin Leidel and Jeff Larkin,
the LSA-SG representatives on
the Student Advisory Board to
LSA ISS, said they're working
to get more clocks in classrooms
because of the survey results.
In addition to the survey, Leidel
and Larkin are garnering stu-

dent input through an LSA ser-
vice called "This Sucks," which
allows students to e-mail com-
plaints to LSA-SG.
In the "This Sucks" e-mails,
Larkin said, students wrote that
clocks are needed for timed tests
and making sure they get out of
class on time.
"It's always nice to have stu-
dent input when you're talking
about a new project or when
you're talking about ways to
improve our education and the
environment," Larkin said. "I
think it's not only valuable to
hear from, the faculty;perspec-
tive, but it's really for students to
voice your opinion."
Initiatives like the one to add
more clocks in classrooms are
significant, Leidel said, since
they derive from direct student
appeals and can be addressed.
"I think it's important for stu-
dents to know where tuition is
being spent, where the tuition's
going," Leidel said. "I think it's
really important that students,
through advocates like the stu-
dent government, have a way
of connecting with faculty and
connecting with people like
(Dressler) who will push to have
student initiatives taken."

and EMILY ORLEY
EDITORIAL PAGE EDITORS

KYLE SWANSON
MANAGING EDITOR

We conclude first and foremost that
this crisis was avoidable."
- Chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Phil Angelides, said
about the 2008 financial crisis on Thursday, as reported by Time Magazine.
The law school scam

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of the Daily's editorial board.
All other signed articles and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.
Ad just) the system
Swain case could set a dangerous precedent
uilty people go to prison, and innocent people don't. What
seems like the most elementary rule of the criminal justice
system is being called into question in the case of Lorinda
Swain. Swain - convicted of sexually abusing her adopted son in
2002 - currently has her case pending before the Michigan Supreme
Court. The court's initial decision not to hear the case risks compro-
mising the values of the justice system and sets a dangerous prec-
edent in which innocent people are incarcerated and unable to prove
their innocence. The Michigan Supreme Court should re-examine
the case and give Swain the opportunity to clear her name.

In 2002, Swain was sentenced to 25 to 50
years in prison for abusing her adopted son,
according to a Jan. 23 Detroit Free Press
article. Her son - who testified against her
at the time - later admitted to fabricating
the accusations. She has recently been work-
ing with attorneys from the University Law
School's Innocence Clinic who have presented
witnesses who also refute the charges. After
reviewing the evidence, Calhoun County
Circuit Judge Conrad Sind agreed to grant
Swain a new trial and released her on bond in
2009. The prosecution appealed this decision,
which was reversed by the Michigan Court of
Appeals. The case was then taken to the Mich-
igan Supreme Court, which declined to hear it
in a 4-3 vote. Swain has asked them to recon-
sider that decision.
The decision made by the Court of Appeals,
which the Michigan Supreme Court has so far
chosen not to correct, reflects a very narrow-
minded interpretation of the law. The ratio-
nale behind not hearing the case is that the
evidence now presented isn't new because'
Swain's previous lawyers were aware of it,
and chose not to use it or even speak to the
witnesses involved. And while it's true that
her former lawyers were aware of the exis-
tence of these witnesses, it's also true that
they were found to be constitutionally inef-
fective in their handling of the case. That, in
and of itself, isgrounds for a new trial, and the

court's inability to recognize that could send a
likely innocent woman back to prison.
The specifics of Swain's case are trou-
bling, but it also points to many concerning
flaws about the criminal justice system. With
advances in technology and DNA evidence,
people once proven guilty are now being
found innocent with new, concrete evidence.
It's horrific to imagine innocent people spend-
ing years in jail for a crime they didn't com-
mit, but it does happen. Regardless of the need
for finality of judgments, there should always
be the opportunity for innocent prisoners to
prove their innocence in court.
The prosecutors appealed the decision to
grant Swain a new trial, arguing that allowing
her to be heard in court years after her convic-
tion would open the floodgates of appeals by
prisoners. But even if that did happen, if any
prisoner can present the kind of evidence that
Swain has, they should have their case recon-
sidered. To not pursue justice because of pos-
sible inconveniences for the court system is an
irresponsible position that compromises the
right to a fair trial that all people are constitu-
tionally guaranteed.
The Michigan Supreme Court needs to
give Swain the opportunity to have the new
evidence heard in court both to prove her
innocence and to set a precedent of always
allowing the justice system to come to a just
conclusion in all cases.

( on't go to law school."
After a couple gasps,
several nervous laughs
and a few gri-
maces silently
asking "are you
serious," we got
the message.
My LSAT
instructor
uttered these :
very words the
last day of a five- JULIAN
week prepa- TOLES
ration course
offered through
the University's Career Center. And
the suggestion was, indeed, genu-
ine. This meant a lot coming from a
current student at the University's
Law School. Apparently my instruc-
tor isn't the only person echoing this
sentiment. Google's eerily accurate
suggestions feature, also finishes the
words "don't go to" with - yes, you
guessed it - law school.
Almost every profession in every
field has borne the brunt of our cur-
rent recession. And, in the midst of
our economic milieu, people tend
to seek shelter under the roofs of
graduate programs and the particu-
larly paradigmatic "safe bet" that is
law school. The fact of the matter is,
quite frankly, that the legal field is
evolving - rapidly.
As students, we often have the
old, familiar "it won't happen to me"
notion that embodies a naive sense of
optimism. Unfortunately the adage
all too often turns into "I never
thought it would happen to me."
Since 2008, 15,000 legal jobs have
vanished to outsourcing, restructur-
ing and cutbacks, yet the total num-
ber of students enrolled in lawschool
is 20,000 more than it was just 10
years ago. And about 40,000 law stu-
dents graduated last year.
The failure to take note of the
sign of the times is evidenced by the
fact that law school applications
and admissions have soared the

past few years. Between 2007 and
2009, the number of students tak-
ing the LSAT rose 20.5 percent. The
University of Alabama Law School
saw it's applicant pool grow by 70
percent last year.
In light of the changing nature
of the legal market, and students'
apparent refusal to consider market
trends, I suggest that the University
integrate more blunt, "in your face"
dialogue between prospective law
students and students or young pro-
fessionals who hold views similar
to my LSAT instructor. A decision
informed by all relevant perspec-
tives will be abetter one.
There are certainly a wealth of
campus programs and literature
about polishing essays and penning
the perfect personal statement. A
cursory glance at the semester list of
University-sponsored pre-law events
confirms this. But genuine, off-the-
cuff commentary may be the most
valuable of all. While it's certainly
encouraging to hear people's success
stories, it's equally valuable to hear,
stories of those who've become disil-
lusioned or regrettheir decision com-
pletely, as to assist future generations
from committing the same mistakes.
Though my instructor's sugges-
tion shocked me initially, it was
oddly refreshing. It was stimulating
to hear someone honestly tell the
"other side" of the story - a story
told directly from the front lines, as
opposed to a counselor or a seasoned
professional.
It almost seems as if, in the aca-
demic setting, stories of strife, strug-
gle and brute failure are discouraged,
as are routes that stray too far off the
beaten path.
Last year, at a presentation about
what the same LSAT course would
entail, a Law School student sug-
gested that we take a year off before
going directly to school. The coun-
selor conducting the session shud-
dered at the suggestion and swiftly
recommended against it. Frankly,

some counselors may be out of touch
with the stark reality and changing
nature of their respective fields. Or
they base suggestions upon sheer
numbers and statistics, and in this
case, the supposed higher likelihood
of acceptance for students who do go
straight to graduate school.
But using numbers as a strict
guide isn't necessarily the smart-
est route - specially in the midst of
what many have begun to call the
"law school scam."
Genuine, off-the-
cuff commentary
can be valuable.
Law schools willingly present sta-
tistics showcasing the employment
successes of their recent graduates,
which typically looms at about 90
percent. A recent New York Times
article says that law schools tend
to hold themselves to "Enron type
accounting standards," manipulating
data in any way they see fit in order
to boost rankings, ratings and appeal.
And it doesn't take much research
to find legions of disgruntled law
school graduates turned renegade
bloggers who feel betrayed by the
system, and in some cases, their own
personal misconceptions of what
schooling and the afterlife would
entail.
A few dedicated eventsior per-
haps a lecture series from the "I
wish I'd done otherwise" camp,
might rightly avert students on the
fence about their decision. Or it
would at least force them to intro-
spect if law school - or any other
professional program for that mat-
ter - is truly right for them.

Study abroad in Israel
TO THE DAILY:
I studied abroad at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem in the Winter 2010 semester. Yes,
I technically had to take a semester off, get my
classes pre-approved and transfer my credits.
Yes, it was a bit of a hassle. And yes, I had an
amazing, life-altering experience. But I never
felt that my security was at risk. Not once in the
five months I was livingthere. And that's com-
ing from someone who lived on Jerusalem's
Mount Scopus, which is technically behind the
green line. I'll even say that I felt much safer
there than I do in the United States.
The fact that the University doesn't have a
study abroad program with an Israeli institu-
tion is ludicrous. There's no more danger there
than in any other developed country. I can tell
you first-hand, I've been to Israel three times
for a total of more than seven months - the
media seriously over-hypes and blurs the
situation there. It's a peaceful and absolutely
beautiful place with the most amazing people,
cultures and foods. It's also a place with many
universities that are ranked in the top 100 in
the entire world.
Yes, I'm Jewish and proud of it. You can say
that makes me biased, but it still doesn't take
away from the fact that Israel truly is the most
magical place on the planet. Go there, set aside
your political ideologies for a moment and
explore the country. Where else can you go ski-
ing, hiking, scuba diving and explore the most
historically important sites on Earth in a coun-
try that is smaller than the state of New Jersey?
People need to stop basing their viewpoints
about Israel from the things they see in the
media. The field of vision of a television cam-
era isverynarrow, butrthe field of vision ofyour
eyes is as wide as you can travel.
I'm living proof that a study abroad program
inIsraelismandatoryforauniversitythatprides
itself on culturalunderstanding and acceptance.

Catchy slogans will not
deter campus bigots
TO THE DAILY:
What are we trying to accomplish?
Let us all acknowledge that broadcasting
the days since the last bias incident in South
Quad Residence Hall was unsuccessful. The
tactic resembled a junior high achievement
goal: If we can collect $200 in bottle returns
for the food drive everyone gets a pizza
party! If we can have zero bias incidents in
three weeks everyone gets ... oh wait ... we're
in college.
The question I ask is what is the goal here?
Is the goal to change the bigots at Michi-
gan? That would be unrealistic. Is the goal to
combat prejudice? That is a stretch. Posters,
slogans and banners won't erase the preju-
dices of a bigot, but they will make an igno-
rant teenager stop and think about how their
words affect other people. Prejudice isn't "a
swastika on a whiteboard or a friend drop-
ping the word 'gay"' but ignorance is. The
way to combat ignorance is to educate.
A bigot will look at those posters and
shrug it off. An ignorant teenager will look
at those posters and think, "Hey, I use that
language, and it has become a habit that I
need to stop." If one out of every 50 students
who are exposed to those posters stop and
think about their language, I would consid-
er the campaign successful. The goal of the
Residents Hall Council's anti-bias campaign
should be to educate. It's that simple.
A campus committee isn't going to solve
prejudice on Michigan's campus. But I shud-
der to think of what would happen if every
campaign decided it was better to do noth-
ing than try something, no matter how small.
If the best we have to offer is clever T-shirts
and good intentions, then by all means, bring
on the slogans.

hile some see fraternity
men as part of a beer-
slamming, Smirnoff
icing, "bro" cul-
ture, I saw my
experience as
a Greek at the '4
University as a
stepping stone to
my future career
aspirations. If
you believe the
aforementioned RYAN,
stereotype KNAPP
describes all
fraternity men,
feel free to stop reading my column.
To be quite frank, I probably won't
change your opinion of "frat bros."
For those of you still around - per-
haps those past, present or even
future Greeks - you will see how
my current journey has been greatly
affected by my decision to Go Greek.
As I embarked on my journey this
summer in New York City and left
the state of Michigan for the longest
period in my life, I was fortunate
enough to stumble upon intern group
housing. By an interesting twist of
fate, two of my other roommates
were also Greek and both served as
presidents of their chapters at Wil-
liam and Mary University and the
University of Minnesota. Doing our
best to relive the glory days of liv-
ing in the fraternity, the three of us
shared a single bedroom with anoth-
er roommate.
As I started working for one
of the largest international sport
agencies, I began to notice my
experience in my fraternity was
very similar to that of the corpo-
rate culture that I was becoming
indoctrinated into. Aside from the
familiar fraternity attire of Vine-
yard Vines, Brooks Brothers and
Ralph Lauren, or the fact that more
than half our intern class consisted
of Greek members, I noticed the
bureaucratic structure mirrored

fraternity life.
The senior vice presidents of the
company are like Fraternity presi-
dents who work together with their
executive board (vice presidents and
associates) to move the company
forward and steer clear from break-
ing the rules and regulations of the
S.E.C. and other governmental bod-
ies (Interfraternity Council). The
head of the internship program is
similar to a new member educator,
leading new members along the pro-
cess, dispensing advice and guiding
the rest of the intern class like a fra-
ternity pledge class. The IT people
act very much like older members
in the chapter - stopping by to give
words of advice and to help out in a
moment of crisis.
As an intern you are very much
like a fraternity pledge - learn-
ing about the company, fitting into
the current culture and completing
tasks that superiors delegate. You
learn about your fellow interns and
how people around the office oper-
ate in a rapid pace, desperately try-
ing to pick up as much as possible.
As you move along (hopefully) with
improved titles and more responsi-
bility, you may eventually find your-
self in senior position - no different
than serving as an executive board
member of your chapter.
For those fraternity and sorority
members who plan to embark on a
similar journey this summer, I will
impart a piece of advice that was
given to me after another intern -
also a fraternity member - showed
up on the first day of work. While
it's important to stand out, wear-
ing bright blue slacks, a pink button
down and Sperry topsiders is prob-
ably not the best way to catch the
attention of those working around
you. You will earn quite a reputation
around the office for being that guy.
I was fortunate to work with a
great team led by a senior execu-
tive who guided me throughout my

internship. But I can't help but think
my experiences in my fraternity were
a catalyst for my success this sum-
mer. Serving the Greek community
as the Interfraternity Council vice
president of public relations for the
past year, I had a unique experience
that allowed me to feel confident in
working in a team environment and
working on multiple projects at once.
Skills developed
in Greek Life
help in work life.

As I returned to Ann Arbor,
friends in my fraternity and in other
chapters related similar stories of
the fraternity-like culture in the
workplace. It's no coincidence that
people I previously worked with in
my chapter, or in the greater Greek
community, were working in invest-
ment banking on Wall Street, serv-
ing to bridge the gap of educational
inequality by working for Teach for
America or trudging through the
gauntlet known as law school. These
individuals, who have attributed a
lot of their success to their time in
the fraternity, honed their leader-
ship and social skills while they were
in the Greek system.
Whether or not you decide to join
a fraternity while in college, hope-
fully you can at least respect the
core principles of why these groups
exist. Whether you join for the social
aspect, the academic side or to fulfill
the need to belong to something big- 0
ger thanyourself, fraternities help to
provide the necessary skills that are
crucial for succeeding in the busi-
ness world.

Berenson wants Blue
to improve defensively

New diving coaches give
M' a chance for success

But with No. Louis Arena

rently riding a FS Detroit
five-game win
streak and sit-
ting atop the CCHA standings,
the senior alternate captain
said that the Wolverines have
all the confidence in the world
heading into its Saturday night
matchup with Michigan State at
Joe Louis Arena.
"We're not even talking
about that," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said of the win-
ning streak. "We're talking
about how we can play bet-
ter. No disrespect to the win-
ning streak, but we were lucky
(against Alaska). We played
hard at times, we didn't play
well defensively and we got
lucky. That's all I can say."
Berenson commented that
the team has to "get back into
good habits," especially in the
defensive zone. Rust reiterated
that the Wolverines (14-4-1-0
CCHA, 17-6-4 overall) need to
do a better job back-checking
and pickingup opponents in the
defensive zone.
"Little things people don't
recognize when they're watch-
ing our game really do niake
a difference, giving a second
effort on battles in the corners
and things like that," Rust said.
Junior defenseman Bran-
don Burlon added that having
heightened awareness on the
ice could certainly be a contrib-
uting factor to playing better
defensively against the Spar-
tans (6-11-2-0,10-13-4).
So far, Michigan and
Michigan State are having
polar-opposite seasons - the

By ANDREW BAUSCHELT
For the Daily
Al Morrison knows diving.
So when Michigan diving
coach KZ Li came to him about
the open volunteer coaching
position, Morrison jumped at
the opportunity.
"I dove at Wisconsin (from
2007 to 2010), but I'm from
Michigan and trained here over
the summer," Morrison said.
"I really am enthusiastic about
the sport of diving ... and have
always had a little passion for
coaching. So when (Li) gave me
the opportunity to coach, I took
it."
For Morrison, though, being
from Michigan isn't the only
personal connection he has
with the program. His younger
brother Chris, a junior diver, is
the only diver on the squad who
isn't a freshman.
"It's kind of neat, having com-
peted against each other for two
years, to now being on the same
side of the pool," Morrison said.
"Sometimes it's probably tough
for him to listen to his older
brother, but it's a unique oppor-
tunity for both of us."
Chris's initial skepticism of
his brother coaching him quick-
ly dissipated as he saw how
his sibling interacted with his
teammates and the advantages
that came along with having
him on the staff.
"When he first came in,
things went better than I had
expected," Chris said. "He's
been in our shoes before and can
relate to you and give you some-
thing that you haven't really
thought about before."
However, Chris has had to
adjust to competing against his

brother just a year ago to having
him as his coach.
There has also been a full
transition in coaching styles,
after the resignation of former
coach Chris Bergere and the hir-
ing of Li before the start of the
season.
"For the most part, I feel like
the transition has gone pretty
smoothly,".Chris said. "You get
more comfortable as the season
goes along, and while (Li) has a
different coaching style than I
had been used to, the new things
that he's implementing are
starting to work.".
This isn't Li's first head
coaching job. He has previously
coached at Minnesota, Flori-
da International, and George
Washington. Li said Michigan's
tradition is a reason whythis job
is special, but it's also challeng-
ing to live up to past successes.
"I think (Li) brings a new way
of looking at diving to Michi-
gan," Al said. "With having a
lot of freshmen, you sometimes
have to go back and teach a
lot of techniques over again
and they've been making huge
strides since the start of his time
here."
With six of the seven fresh-
men divers this season, Li can
relate to the feeling that the new
divers are going through, as he
himself is a "freshman" coach at
Michigan.
"Since I'm one of the newer
coaches here, I sometimes feel
a little bit like a freshman," Li
said. "You learn a lot of stuff,
have to make a lot of adjust-
ments and every school is dif-
ferent."
With the coaching transition
and surplus of freshmen div-
ers, the younger Morrison has

become the leader of the div-
ing team - a role he is learning
more and more as each week
passes.
"With all the freshmen on our
team, I have kind of taken on
the leadership position," Chris
said. "It's weird going from just
another member on the team
last year to being the team lead-
er this year, but I'm trying to
give these guys a good example
and model for when their fresh-
man classes come in."
Chris can tell that he can still
improve in his leadership role
and Li notes that he has seen
that as well.
In Chris's eyes, Michigan div-
ing has been in the shadows of
the swimming team after a cou-
ple years of poor performances,
and his goal is to bring the div-
ing team back to the forefront,
along with the swimmers.
"The past few years I felt like
we were winning competitions
and advancing mostly because
of the swimming team and not
so much the diving team," Chris
said. "I feel like I really didn't
perform my best in the Big Ten's
and NCAA's in the last two
years, but I'm looking to per-
form better both individually
and as ateam."
For Li and the Morrison
brothers, the goal is simple:
Bring Michigan diving back to
where it once was.
"I think if we can get some
good performances and scores
at Big Ten's then I would say this
season is a success," Chris said.
"With how everything has
gone so far and (Li) bringing in
his own recruits over the next
couple years, I can definitely
see Michigan diving succeeding
right along with swimming."

JAKE FROMM/Daily
Junior defenseman Brandon Burlon has been a consistent member of the
Wolverines' blue line this season, paired with sophomore Lee Moffie.

Wolverines are vying for a regu-
lar-season conference title and
the Spartans are in second-to-
last place in the CCHA. Beren-
son said that with any game
against its in-state rival, you
could throw out records, past
games and historical trends.
On Tuesday, the 27-year-coach
called Michigan State a "better
team" than its positioning indi-
cates.
"We've had our ups and
downs with them and vice
versa," Berenson said. "The
program has been - no matter
how bad or good either teamis,
.it seems like the games are still
close."
A significant reason why
the Wolverines and Spartans
always had competitive match-
ups over the years is because
of the two coaches manning
the programs - Berenson and
Michigan State coach Rick
Comley. This weekend could
potentially be the last time the
two legendary coaches share a
post-game handshake, as ear-
lier this week Comley surpris-
ingly announced his retirement

at the end of the season.
Saturday's contest will place
two of college hockey's all-time
winningest coaches against
each other - Comley is fourth
on the list while Berenson is
behind at fifth. Even though
the Michigan-Michigan State
rivalry will lose one of its key
pieces at the end of the season,
Comley's lasting impact at the
Division-I level is apparent -
just look at his 768 career wins
and NCAA title in 2007 as evi-
dence of his collegiate success.
"When he got the job at
Michigan State then we saw,
him a lot more," Berenson said.
"He's had his ups and downs
there but that national cham-
pionship is pretty neat. We
haven't been close to a national
championship in a number of
years now, so good for him. But
I am surprised (about his retire-
ment).
"I don't know what the sce-
nario is or what prompted that.
Maybe he thought it was time.
He's been a respected coach,
when you look at the longevity,
38 years, and the wins."

MEN S TENNIS
'M' builds confidence after close call against Texas,*

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
Entering its match against
No. 5 Texas, the No. 24 Michi-
gan men's tennis team wasn't
expecting much success.
But after losing a 4-3 nail-
biter to the Longhorns, the
Wolverines are brimming with
confidence and won't go into a
match with low expectations
again - no matter how tough
their future opponents may be.
"I actually didn't think we
were going to come that close,"
senior captain Jason Jung said.
"I mean, obviously you go into
every match thinking you can
win, but I was surprised. It defi-
nitely shows that we're in there
with the best. We'll definitely
have more of a positive approach
this time around, coming in and

facing another top team."
This weekend, Michigan trav-
els to Durham, N.C. to compete
at the ITA Kick-Off Weekend.
It's a four-team tournament,
with the winners advancing to
the ITA National Team Indoors
Championship, held Feb. 18-21
in Seattle, Washington.
Michigan will face No. 14
Duke in the firstround, followed
by either No. 21 Pepperdine or
No. 25 Virginia Tech. The Wol-
verines are the No. 4 seed and
haven't advanced to National
Indoors since the 2008-09 sea-
son.
After the tournament, Mich-
igan will have faced three
top-25 teams in its first four
dual-matches, and the Wolver-
ines better get used to it. Of its 12
non-conference matches, 11 are
against top-50 teams, including

five against top-25 squads.
And in the Big Ten, things
won't get much easier, as Michi-
gan will face perennial powers
No. 4 Ohio State and No. 16 Illi-
nois.
If the Wolverines can make it
through their schedule relative-
ly unscathed, or at least without
third-degree burns, they should
be in fine shape for the NCAA
tournament.
"It's exciting," Michigan
coach Bruce Berque said.
"Because players want to be
tested and they want to be chal-
lenged, and I think you kind of
communicate to them what you
expect from them and what you
think of them with the schedule
you put together.
"I think what we're trying to
communicate to them is that we
are trying to set Michigan up to

And even if they do struggle,
it shouldn't be a major problem,
either.
"I definitely think (our tough
schedule is) an advantage,"
Berque said. "Especially in ten-
nis, where qualifying for (the
NCAA) Tournament is really
based on the number of quality
wins you have. If you take a few
losses along the way, it doesn't
really hurt you.
"The only way it can really
hurt you is if your team breaks
down in their confidence when
they hit a losing spell. And I just
don't think that this would hap-
pen to this group, even if we did
take a few losses ... They're con-
fident."

NOVA K-ING DOWN

CHRIS RYBA/Daily

Juniorguard Zack Novak scored a team-high 19 points and hit six 3-pointers in Michigan's upset over Michigan State.

Novak's triples pace Blue past
MSU for first time since 2007

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily SportsEditor
EAST LANSING - In the
dead of winter, four young men
stood
at the MICHIGAN 61
front MICHIGAN STATE 57
of the
Michigan State student section
behind the baseline at the Bre-
slin Center. Their chests read:
1181.
It was the total number of
days since a Michigan football
or men's basketball team beat
Michigan State.
But at the end of the game
all they could do was grab their
shirts and head for the exits as
the Wolverines (2-6 Big Ten,
12-9 overall) ended that drought
and made those numbers a thing
of the past.
With Michigan's 61-57 win,
the Wolverines snapped a six-
game losing streak and picked
up the Michigan men's basket-
ball team's first win over the
Spartans since 2007.
The young squad showed
a poise that's been missing in
close games as the Wolverines
built upon a seven-point half-
time lead over No. 25 Michigan
State (4-4, 12-8).
The Spartans' poor shooting
and their struggle to finish easy
buckets under the basket sealed
the deal for the Wolverines.
Despite shooting 44 percent
from the floor, Michigan State
missed several layups and put-

backs. And the Spartans only hit
five shots from behind the arc
the entire game.
Junior guard Zack Novak hit
six.
It was Novak's four first-half
3-pointers that gave the Wolver-
ines the cushion heading into
the break, but he came out even
more on fire in the second half
hitting two more shots, finish-
ing with 19 points.
"It was one of those nights,"
Novak said after the game,
unable to hide his smile after
coming out of a locker room that
was raucous with shouts of 'The
Victors.'
Sophomore point guard Dar-
ius Morris added 17 points and
eight assists - the most assists
he's had since the Wolverines
traveled to Indiana two weeks
ago.
But even with Morris' and
Novak's monster games, the
Wolverines never put the game
out of reach. With under two
minutes remaining in the game,
the Spartans cut Michigan's
once 14-point lead to a meager
two points when senior guard
Kalin Lucas drew a foul and
converted on the additional
point from the charity stripe.
Michigan was unable to con-
vert on the ensuing play and the
Spartans found themselves in a
position to steal back the lead.

At Big Ten media day, Zack
Novak had higher expectations
for the Wolverines than others
did.
"We are a young team with
a lot of guys that are kind of
naive because they're young,"
Novak said. "They don't know
that they're not supposed to win
some of these
games. They
don't know
that they
should lose

Kansas. So

help us." ZAK
As Michi- PYZIK
gan entered
Big Ten play
with an 11-2 record, itseemed as if
the junior was correct. The Wol-
verines hung with then-No. 8 Syr-
acuse in Atlantic City, they also
forced No. 3 Kansas into overtime
at Crisler Arena and, in the same
week, they lost to now-No.I Ohio
Statehbyjust four points.
But things changed. The Wol-
verines were blown out at Assem-
bly Hall by Indiana - who hadn't
won a conference game at that
point. After that, John Shurna,
who couldn't jump because of a
high-ankle sprain, led a strug-
gling Northwestern squad to vic-
tory after scoring 24 points on a
Wolverine defense that left their
dignityback inBloomington.
Expectations lessened.
Then when things seemed as
if they couldn't get any worse,
Michiganlostto No.15 Minnesota
athome.
Unfortunately for Michigan
- a team that starts three fresh-
men, a sophomore and a junior
- its youthfulness was exposed,
to the tune of six-straight losses.
Heading into East Lansing to face
Michigan State, we all thought
Michigan had learned how to lose.
How could Novak ever think
that youth, of all things, would
actually propel a team to upsets
over top-25 programs, or a rival
like the Spartans? Novak was
the one who had set his expecta-
tions too high. But on Thursday
night at around 9:30 p.m., I bit my
tongue. As the buzzer sounded
and Michigan State fans began
to pick fights with those wearing
maize andblue, mytongue fell out
of my mouth because of how hard
I bit it.
The Wolverines beat the Spar-
tans 61-57 in East Lansing on
Thursday. It was the first time
Michigan had defeated Michigan
State at the Breslin Center since
1997.I, and manyothers, ruledthe
Wolverines out of this one before
it even started.

I had an entire article writ-
ten as if Michigan lost its seventh
straight game. In fact, I was about
to call Novak out for thinking this
young team could hang with the
big boys of the Big Ten. The same
Novak that notched a team-high
19 points to cash in the upset bid,
the same Novak that scored the
first four 3-pointers he shot on
Thursday, the same Novak that let
me know I was terribly wrong for
passing judgment onthisteamtoo
soon.
Novak said before the Michi-
gan State game that this team
needs to get back ontrack, he even
said how great it would be for the
Wolverines' realignment to come
from beating the Spartans - a
program he said he hates more
than any other.
But not many, includingmyself,
gave Michigan a shot. I mean, do
you blame me? The Wolverines
came in having not beaten the
Spartans in 1181 days. For good-
ness sakes, it wasn't even a gam-
ble, it was a promise.
To my disbelief, the Wolverines
shot SO percent from the field and
48 percent from 3-point range,
Michigan's defense forced 12
turnovers and Wolverine guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. collected a
team-higheight rebounds - more
than Michigan State's Draymond
Green. Michigan did everything
in this one game that it hadn't
done in its last six - it played
sound basketball.
So while I sat in an empty Bre-
slin Center, I asked myself one
question(actuallyIthoughtofone
question because I couldn't speak
since my tongue was still in the
bleachers) - was this a fluke or is
this the start of a new Michigan
team?
And as I was about to write
another 200 wordsato answer that
question, Michigan basketball
Sports Information Director Tom
Wywrot jokingly said, "so much
for your pregame video." He was
referring to the video in which
I predicted Michigan would be
obliterated by the Spartans. At
that point I hit the backspace
button a few times and realized
I couldn't answer that question.
And I shouldn't at this point,
because there's a whole lot of bas-
ketball left.
Because of Thursday night's
upset, I have no idea of what to
expect from this team in the sec-
ond half of their Big Ten season.
But there is one thing I did learn:
don't make expectations, period.
Novak may have been right, you
never know what to expect from a
young teamlike this one.
Tom was right; I'm the naive
one.

give Michigan a five point lead
with under 20 seconds.
"(I've hit) some big shots
(before), but for the situation,
the location and time of season
and just the team that we have,
it was a big shot," said Douglass,
who said he knew it was going in
when it left his hands.

Because when the two teams
face off against each other at
Crisler Arena, that will be the
number of days since a Spartan
team has defeated the Michigan
men's basketball team.

Sheffer's big night gives 'M' series sweep of Buckeyes

ByKEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - The Michigan
women's basketball team defied
history last night.
After trailing by 14 points early
in the second half, the Wolverines
climbed
all the way MICHIGAN 69
back to beat OHIO STATE 66
the six-
time defending Big Ten champion
Buckeyes, 69-66. It was the first
time in Michigan women's bas-
ketball history that they swept the
two-game season series with Ohio
State.
With the Buckeyes' 6-foot-4,
two-time All American Jantel
Lavender lurking in the post,
Michigan knew it would have to
key its defense down low.
And for the most part, the Wol-
verines succeeded. Lavender was
held to just 10 points, which ties
her career low for points in agame.
Michigan hounded her in the post
all night long, often putting three
or four defenders in her face as
soon as she touched the ball.
"It's frustrating when you can't
do what you like doing," Lavender
said after the game. "And (it's frus-
trating when) it's not really hap-
pening throughout the course of
the game."
But in the first half, it didn't

matter what Michigan did defen-
sively.
Ohio State junior guard Saman-
tha Prahalis, was absolutely
unstoppable, going 7-7 from the
field (5-5 from deep) en route to a
19-point first half.
"She was the X factor in the first
half," Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth said. "She was hitting step-
backs, she was hitting pull-ups,
taking it right at us - she was hot
as a pistol"
But Michigan has a few shoot-
ers of its own and they weren't
willing to let Prahalis steal the
show completely.
Sophomore forward Rachel
Sheffer, junior guard Courtney
Boylan, senior guard Veronica
Hicks and sophomore forward
Kate Thompson all had two
3-pointers in the first half.
The Wolverines shot 67 percent
from behind the arc in the first
frame. They still went into the
break down 46-33.
"I thought we did a pretty good
job for the most part in the first
half," Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth said. "At times we got a little bit
nervous, a little bit anxious offen-
sively and turned the ball over.
"I just thought in the second
half if we could get to the free
throw line, continue doing what
we're doing and get to Prahalis a
bit, we'd have a chance."

To start the second half, Ohio
State started hot from deep once
again. After Sheffer hit two free
throws, Ohio State senior guard
Brittany Johnson drilled her third
3-pointer of the contest to give the
Buckeyes a 14-point lead - their
biggest of the game.
But from there, Michigan went
on a run of its own. After a pair of
free throws by junior guard Car-
men Reynolds, an Ohio native,
Sheffer went on a tear, scoring
eight straight points. Her 3-point-
er with 14 minutes to go cut the
Ohio State lead to just four.
Suddenly, it was an entire differ-
ent ball game. The Buckeyes were
wary of a Wolverine comeback.
They became stagnant on offense,
often settling for a contested jump
shot rather than looking into the
post. Michigan took the Buckeyes
right out of their gameplan.
"If you look at the difference
between what they did and what
we did, you'll see that they hit ten
threes," Ohio State coach Jim Fos-
ter said. "But they never forgot the
post."
The Wolverines kept the game
within reach for the rest of the
game. After a jumper by Hicks
with 2:12 remaining, they found
themselves down by just two.
"We just wanted to stay with
it," Borseth said. "We knew if we
stayed close, got stops, and took

care of it, (we would have a good
chance to win the game)."
And Michigan did all three of
those things. After Prahalis hit a
jumper to increase the lead to four,
Sheffer made what was arguably
the best move of her career.
With Lavender guarding her,

A double dose of
Sundance USA

The Swell Season will play tomorrow as part of the Ann Arbor Folk Festival.
A2 festival forI all folk

The Avett Brothers,
Mavis Staples headline
34th Folk Festival
By MIKE KUNTZ
Daily Arts Writer
From its humble beginnings as aone-
night stand at the Power Center in 1977,
the Ann Arbor Folk Festival has become
a celebration of folk
music in all its forms.A
Over the course of its Ann Arbor
more than 30-year Folk Festival
history, The Ark's
annual hootenanny Hill Auditorium
has become one of Todaypandtomorrow
the most popular at6:30 p.m.
musical events in Ticketsfrom $30
town all year.
In addition to
hosting folk legends like Pete Seeger and
John Prine in previous years, past head-
liners Jeff Tweedy, Ben Gibbard and Jay
Farrar, Iron & Wine and Ben Folds are
all names that can be found somewhere
in the average college kid's iPod - a fact
not lost on festival organizers looking to
appeal to both old folkies and University
hipsters alike.
This year's lineup continues the fes-
tival's youth-centric streak with head-
liners The Avett Brothers, Citizen Cope
and the Swell Season, while-also boasting
national treasures like Mavis Staples and
the sweet blue-eyed Judy Collins of the
late-'60s Laurel Canyon scene. As in pre-
vious years,this weekend's festivalprom-
ises to be an eclectic mix of old and new.
Now in its 34th year (the folk fest
skipped '78), the tagline for this week-
end's event is "Find Your Folk," a nod
toward embracing the big tent that folk

music, in all its forms, has become over
time.
"I think people have a lot of precon-
ceived notions about what folk music is,"
said Ark marketing director Barb Chaf-
fer Authier'who recently spoke with the
Daily about the festival's history and why
its connection to University audiences is
so important.
"The whole point of the festival is to
get a taste of all these different artists,"
Authier said. "We want to just remind
people that (folk) is a much broader cat-
egory than they might think ... and we
hope folks will be open to hearing new
things and discovering different artists."
From its more humble beginnings as
a progenitor of acts like John Prine and
Leon Redbone (along with a few rem-
nants of Ann Arbor's thriving late-'60s
singer-songwriter scene), the Folk Fes-
tival - the brainchild and central fun-
draiser for the famed local fixture The
Ark - has been an annual event bringing
together the disparate strands of dusty
Americana under one roof.
In 2003, the festival moved to the
Michigan Theater due to the Hill Audi-
torium being closed for renovation. To
make up for the lack of seating in the
smaller venue, event organizers opted to
add an extra night to the affair to accom-
modate for the same-sized crowd, albeit
split in two. The plan was such a hit that,
once they returned to Hill in 2004, Ark
organizers were prompted to uphold the
two-night format ever since. But there
was some debate onto how the split
should work.
"Once we moved into that two-night
idea, there was a lot of thought going into
how we would distinguish the two nights
from each other," Authier said.
Since the move to separate the festival
across two nights, the festival's M.O. has

generally been to attract hipper, more
up-and-coming headliners Friday night,
leaving the older, more tenured acts to
play Saturday. Recently, however, event
programmers have been considering
changing things up.
"For a while, there was a lot of focus on
the first night being geared toward up-
and-coming artists or people that kind of
push the boundaries of what it means to
be playing folk music,"Authier said. "But
I think we're getting to that point where
you might see the two nights coming a
little closer together in what people's
expectations for the music are going to
be."
Echoing this trend, ticket sales for
this year's festival have shown a rise in
the purchasing of "series tickets" - the
festival's combined two-night ticketing
option - perhaps demonstrating audi-
ences' desire to stick around through the
weekend.
Though the festival has always
attracted national artists that ultimately
demand the most attention (and ticket
sales) from Ann Arbor audiences, Ark
event programmer Anya Siglin - who
also books for the venue year-round
- has been keen to pepper in local or
developing artists in order to expose fans
to similar-sounding and exciting new
breeds of folk music.
"The idea of the festival isn't just to
present the big name headliners," Auth-
ier pointed out. "The other folks on the
bill are artistswe really believe in and the
festival gives them a chance to be seen."
Though Friday night is sold out, tick-
ets are still available for Saturday, with
prices starting at $30.
"Be sure to come at the beginning,"
Authier warned. "You don't want to risk
missing the next great thing because you
didn't get there in time!"

In many ways, the regal red carpet
epitomizes the ideals of big city fame,
especially considering the immeasur-
able wealth and
extravagant apparel Sundance USA
of the film person- C R s
alities and other
socialites who tread Michigan Theater
upon it each day. ButT
one may not realize Tonightatl:30p.m.
that the extensive
acclaim held by the likes of Abigail Bre-
slin, Kevin Smith and Quentin Taran-
tino owes a debt to the Sundance Film
Festival, a humble yet beloved staple of
the independent film community. And
for the past two years, Ann Arbor's own
Michigan Theater has enjoyed a share
of the yearly Sundance hubbub with the
advent of a national publicity initiative
called Sundance USA.
The program includes a bevy of film
screenings and filmmakers' commen-
taries in select host cities across the
country. This year, Sundance USA caters
to the burgeoning arts communities of
eight cities, including San Francisco,
Brooklyn, Seattle and Los Angeles. But
the historic Michigan Theater holds the
distinct honor of hosting two Sundance
feature films.
'Cedar Rapids' is
the Michigan's
second 2011
Sundance film.
Accordingto Drew Waller, director of
marketing at the Michigan Theater, this
opportunity distinguishes the theater
from the other Sundance USA locales
- each of which hosts a single film. Ann
Arbor's small size is offset by its resi-
dents' passion for quality art, and with
two films, most will be able to enjoy a
show without a hitch.
"We've been put in the position where
we're the smallest market with the larg-
est venue. Most of the larger markets
have a modern multiplex with three
hundred or four hundred seats," Waller
said in a recent interview with the Daily.
"In our case, we have a historic the-

ater with a capacity of 1,700 people. So
we're in the best position to get as many
people to come as possible, whereas the
other shows are sold out in a flash."
Last night, the theater featured
Thomas McCarthy's "Win Win" star-
ring Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan.
"Cedar Rapids" will screen tonightat
7:30 p.m. Its inclusion in the showcase
was an easy decision for the film's pro-
duction staff, since the majority of the
movie was shot in Ann Arbor and its
surrounding areas.
"A good portion of the film takes
place in a dilapidated hotel adjacent to
Weber's Hotel off I-94, and it fits the
humor and the tongue-in-cheek tone of
the story very well," Waller said.
Many filmmakers flock to Michigan
for the generous tax credits. However,
the city of Ann Arbor held a unique
allure for the "Cedar Rapids" crew due
to its lack of cumbersome red tape.
"The Visitor and Civics Bureau as
well as the Screen Arts & Cultures
Guild made the whole process very easy
regarding accessibility of resources.
There was plenty of good discussion
before the film was made as to how to
make the process as simple as possible
for the crew," Waller said.
The Michigan Theater's business
relationship with the organizers of the
Sundance Festival is the result of the
yearly Art House Convergence confer-
ence. This year's Convergence ran from
Jan. 17th-20th and brought art house
theater owners from around the coun-
try together under the same roof. Dur-
ing the event, proprietors discussed
ways to keep the unadulterated genre
of art cinema relevant and distinguish-
able from the rote popcorn fluff of main-
stream Hollywood.
"The goal is to develop a new per-
spective of the Michigan Theater. Last
year's Sundance screenings showed
that we have the fortitude and foresight
to organize something of this caliber,"
Waller said. "Not only that, it gave us a
platform to say, 'We don't just do this on
any given weekend, we do it 365 days a
year.'"
Granted, this beautiful venue and its
faithful clientele will have to share their
moment in the sun with the eight other
host cities. But with the Michigan's rich
history and ability to afford an addition-
al screening to spite an array of mass-
manufactured multiplexes, Ann Arbor's
spotlight is sure to shine a bit brighter
this weekend.

Ebert's career has been largely
defined by his role on "At the Movies,"
the long-running TV movie review
series with the iconic thumbs up/
thumbs down rating system. The show
also received mass derision from many
working critics for boiling down the
nuanced prose of their profession to a
simple binary scale - ironic, since "At
the Movies" was never about its thumbs,
but about how its hosts defended those
thumbs, with ping-pong discussions
and heated banter. More importantly,
the hosts' passionate discourse taught
impressionable young film buffs all over
that it's OK to yell at your best friend
over the merits of "Blue Velvet."
Now the latest iteration of "At the
Movies" is upon us. It's a deliberate, PBS-
funded slap in the face to those who say
that criticism is a dying profession, with
Ebert back on TV for the first time since
his thyroid cancer surgery in 2006. And
the brief, two-minute segment when he's

on air - during which he heaps praise
on new animated film "My Dog Tulip"
- is the show's best moment, thanks to
legendary director Werner Herzog's bril-
liant reading of Ebert's prose.
This is Ebert's only physical appear-
ance on the show, but as executive
producer he's definitely making his
presence known. Associated Press crit-
ic Christy Lemire, one of the new co-
hosts, introduces the week's film lineup
by saying "This week on 'Ebert Pres-
ents' " instead of "This week on 'At the
Movies,' " as though the movies them-
selves were being presented by Ebert.
And then there are the old clips of him
and former co-host Gene Siskel, since
deceased, that play over the end cred-
its. If this is indeed going to usher in a
new era of critics, as it's clearly intended
to, Ebert wants to be the newly recon-
structed face of it.
The thumbs are
neither up nor
down for this show.
So what is the new face of film criti-
cism - how is "Ebert Presents" about
what it's about? Well, there are still the
two faces arguing about the films of
the week: Opposite Lemire is 24-year
old, Moskow-born film blogger Ignatiy
Vishnevetsky. She's the traditionalist;
he's the new media representative. She
hates everything; he likes everything,
even "No Strings Attached" and "The
Green Hornet." They boast large, local-
news smiles.

But their discourse - the only reason
a show like this should exist - rarely
sizzles above room temperature. There's
little back-and-forth, and Vishnevetsky
mostly limits his arguments to saying, "I
completely disagree." Siskel and Ebert
never cared about being nice or even
articulate, but they had passion, and
that was the point. The bread and but-
ter of criticism is passion, not simply the
doling out of opinion.
Granted, the task of providing dia-
logue worthy of Ebert's vocal history
is a considerable one, made harder
by his insistence in being the show's
mostly unseen "third man." Lemire and
Vishnevetsky should improve their dis-
course over time. But how are they sup-
posed to distinguish themselves while
working underneath Ebert's enforced
shadow?
Fittingly, there's one figure that hov-
ers over the proceedings even more
than Ebert, and that figure is Orson
Welles. Between a clever introductory
skit parodying the original trailer for
"Citizen Kane," a (somewhat vapid) seg-
ment where Sunset Gun blogger Kim
Morgan celebrates "The Third Man"
and a production company logo that
casts Ebert as the infamous Harry Lime,
there's a distinctly Wellesian undertone
to the first episode of "Ebert Presents."
It makes sense, considering the naked
ambition in Ebert's attempt to revital-
ize the world of film criticism, and the
hubris of making his name so visible on
the marquee.
Will Ebert, as the "third man" of
criticism, succeed? Only if he can heed
his own immortal words and keep the
"how" of the show in the forefront of
his mind. Film buffs everywhere will be
holding their collective breath.

Recently, it seems the mainstream
rap game has become oversaturated
with designer duds and swaggering
wannabes, slathering
their tracks with Auto-*
Tune and gold chains.
But amid the misguid- Talib Kweli
ed hero-worship of
poseurs, Talib Kweli Gutter
has always been a rap- Rainbows
per's rapper.
On Gutter Rainbows, Blacksmith
Kweli gets back to the
basics, with nary a peep about diamond-
encrusted Escalades. He has remained
firmly on the outskirts of mainstream
rap, a genre populated by cocksure hacks
more concerned with chart numbers than
storytelling. With his latest album, Kweli
re-enters the music world hell-bent on
showing these fakes how it's done.
The album's title track is a sprawl-
ing showpiece, with soaring horns and
a hard beat. The song harkens back to
the days when rap advocated for the
have-nots. "Gutter Rainbows" has a dis-
tinctly vintage feel - Kweli humanizes
the marginalized denizens of the ghet-
to, and acts as a powerful "voice of the
voiceless, hope for the hopeless." Kweli's
flow is tighter than ever, and it's no won-
der powerhouses like Jay-Z and Kanye
West claim Kweli as an inspiration.
Kweli sticks to similar themes on
"Cold Rain." The track opens with him
saying "Let's try something new," but
this song is classic Talib. It features a
crooning female gospel singer while
a soulful piano accompanies Kweli's
socially conscious lyrics. "Cold Rain"
recalls a time when rap was a storytell-
ing medium. And Kweli's literate and
astute commentary is a welcome relief
in a rap market that glorifies over-indul-
gent capitalism. Kweli may be "a prod-
uct of Reaganomics," according to the

song's lyrics, but he sings for the victims
of budget cuts: "We're freedom writers
like Bob Moses / the chosen, freedom
writers like Voltaire / For my block, my
borough, my hood, my city, my state,
yeah / My obligation to my community
is so clear / Yeah, we gotta savethem,
this opportunity so rare."
Kweli indulges in some well deserved
boasting and schools all the narcissist
phonies on "I'm On One." The track fea-
tures a raw beat and the artist rapping
on the hook that "Stop posing for the
camera / I'm showing all you amateurs
/ life is a bitch, that's how you handle
her." He spits faster and better than
most of the rappers out there and has no
problem exposing all these fame hoard-
ers for their devious ways. Don't piss off
Talib Kweli, because he will skewer you
in the cleverest way possible.
It seems that skills
sold, truth be told.
The record may be stocked with solid
tracks, but even Kweli isn't immune to
the seductive powers of an Auto-Tuned
slow jam. "How You Love Me" sounds
like a Ne-Yo track (not a compliment)
and comes across as bland with lyrics
too dull to repeat. The track is plagued
by a mind-numbing slow clap, which
seems fitting considering that the song
ends up being so anti-climatic.
Kweli's latest album is a nearly pitch-
perfect masterpiece with the occasion-
al misstep or two. And though Kweli
exposes the crippling bleakness inher-
ent in the ghettos he grew up in, the
album is ultimately optimistic. He finds
beauty even in the artificially created
"gutter rainbow," and on the record, he
blends conflicting emotions to create his
own cacophony of colors.
