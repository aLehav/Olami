A fire broke out at the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity house
early Saturday morning, sending
four people to the hospital.
According to a release, the
Ann Arbor Fire Department
responded to a structure fire
at 1408 Washtenaw Ave. at 5:37
a.m. The address provided in
the report corresponds to the
location of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity.
Four fraternity brothers were
released from the hospital after
precautionary visits for possible
smoke inhalation, according to
Business sophomore Brett Mizzi,
SAE president.
Upon arrival, fire crews
found a fire ina coat closet. First
responders rescued 20 residents
from the building, including the
four taken by ambulance.,Crews
were able to control the blaze
within 20 minutes, keeping it

contained to the front area of the
building.
The cause of the fire is
still under investigation. The
fraternity house suffered smoke
damage on all floors and fire
damage to approximately one
half of the square footage on the
first floor, AAFD Battalion Chief
Steven Lowe said.
Mizzi said the University
helped fraternity brothers
affected by the fire find alternate
housing in hotels while the house
is being repaired. However, many
of the brothers have relocated to
Varsity Management apartments
on amonthlylease.
"They're all taken care of,"
Mizzi said.
Fire and police agencies from
Ypsilanti, Ypsilanti Township,
Pittsfield Township, Superior
Township and University Police
assisted, and no firefighters were
injured.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon is
no longer recognized by the
University after allegations of
hazing led to the fraternity's
expulsionfromtheInterfraternity
Council in 2011.
In November, two males were
stabbed near the house during
an altercation, resulting in minor
injuries.

Two statues representing the
University's desire for academic
and athletic excellence adorn

both sides of the Michigan
Union's main entrance.
However, University alum David
Merritt, former co-captain of
the Michigan basketball team,
wants to show students that
it's possible to bridge the gap
between the two.
Merritt visited the University
Friday to offer entrepreneurial
students advice on how to go
about building their ventures

and start-ups. Though he was
hesitant to call himself an expert
in entrepreneurship, Merritt
turned his experiences and
mistakes in the classroom and
on the court into tools students
can learn from.
The talk was hosted by the
Center for Entrepreneurship as
a part of its Entrepreneurship
Hour series, in conjunction with
the Michigan Engineering Com-

mon Reading Experience. Titled
"Doing Well and Doing Good,"
the discussion focused on doing
business while making a social
impact.
Originally from Detroit,
Merritt earned an academic
scholarship to the University
and enrolled with the hope
that. he would be able to play
on the men's basketball team.

CAMPUS LIFE
Transfers to 'U'
contend with
new challenges

Gathering of students
and administrators
discusses academic
rigor and support
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
Change is never easy, but the
goal is to make it a little less
hard.
Students and administrators
engaged in an open dialogue at
the Commission on Transfer
Student Resources' first
Transfer Student Symposium
Saturday in the Michigan Union.
The day included testimonials
from a panel of transfer students
and collaborative development
of possible plans for the future.
The commission presented
data from a survey it conducted,
sent out to about 3,000 transfer
students, which brought to light

areas of concern.
The data showed that transfer
students struggle most with the
academic transition, regarding
properly transferring credits
and understanding the difficulty
of the classes they signed up for.
Of the 19 percent of transfer
students who responded to the
survey, the top challenges cited
were time management and the
rigor of University classes.
At the discussion, the
participants also expressed
concern with the short length of
orientation for transfer students.
LSA senior Tyler Mesman, chair
of the Commission on Transfer
Student Resources, said the
overload of information in a few
hours is often overwhelming.
Toward the end of the sym-
posium, attendants were asked
to write down goals on index
cards. The goals of administra-
tors and students mainly dealt
with easing this academic tran-

The Ldim Irish Dance
group put on its annual
performance Friday night at

the Mendelssohn Theatre in
front of a crowd of friends,
family and other students.
The group was founded
in 2000 as a platform for
experienced Irish dancers to
foster their love for the dance
and to spread their passion to
other students who wished
to learn it. Ldim hosts one
major performance every
year and is involved in other

small-scale events, including
a performance on the Diag to

Students call for meal p
Forty years ago this week Twenty-four years ago this
(Feb.14,1974) week (Feb. 16,1990)

In opposition to a proposed
increase in residence hall rates
of 8 percent, or $100 per housing
resident, members of the Hous-
ing Policy Committee revealed
their proposal for alternate
budgeting situations that would
avoid the increase.
Several of HPC's sugges-
tions included replacing dorm
staffers with student workers
and closing the Student Activi-
ties Building. HPC member
David Faye told the Daily that
the group's opposition to the
increase stemmed mainly from
the view that it was unneces-,
sary.
CRIME NOTES

Led by several members of the
Michigan Student Assembly, a
petition drive was launched to
reform the University's meal plan
options. The meal plans at the
time were set by meals per week,
and petitioners wanted to change
that to one set number forthe year.
LSA freshman Rob Rielly,
a Michigan Student Assembly
member and one of the leaders of
the push, said the current meal
plans were unfair to students.
"Right now, you get 13 meals a
week, two meals a day and if you
don't eat one of those meals you
lose it," Rielly said. "What we're
pushing for is spreading those

meals out. You get 400 meals for
the year, and you can budget your
meals however you want."

sion policies, spoke at the Univer-

the College Republicans, who
had asked her to talk about her
experience and perspective dur-
ing the court case and as one of
the organizers for a statewide
ban on affirmative action.

Next step uncertain in Woody
Allen assault allegations

Director's adopted
daughter first leveled
accusations in 1992
NEW YORK (AP) - A week
bracketed by op-ed letters of
accusation and denial of child
molestation left little clarity and
scant hope for resolution in a bit-
ter saga that has haunted Woody
Allen and the Farrow family for
more than two decades.
The back-and-forth between
Allen and his adopted daugh-
ter, Dylan Farrow, breathed new
fire into a long dormant scandal,
but what happens next is uncer-
tain, with the possibility of legal
recourse and continued scrutiny
in the weeks and months ahead.
Farrow, in her most detailed
account yet, alleged in an open
letter published Feb. 1 by The
New York Times that Allen "sex-
ually assaulted" her when she
was 7 years old at the Farrows'

Pro-European Union activists stand in front of a barricade of their tent camp to protect it, in downtown Kiev, Ukraine on
Saturday.
Protesters experience upset
after months of non-violence

Anti-government
protesters build
large tent camp in,
Kiev square
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -
Thousands of people angered
by months of anti-government
protests in the Ukrainian
capital converged on one of the
protesters' barricades Saturday,
but retreated after meeting
sizeable resistance.
Although the confrontation
ended without violence, it
underlined the tensions that
persist as the protests slog
through a third month with no
sign of concession from either
side.
The anti-government
protesters have set up an
extensivetent camp ondowntown
Kiev's main square and occupy
three nearby buildings, including
the city hall, that they use for
operations centers, sleeping
quarters and even an improvised
library. They have also built
extensive barricades of earth,
bags of ice and refuse on the
fringes of the area.
About 2,000 people streamed

toward the barricade near city
hall at midday, blocking traffic
on the capital's main avenue and
placing tires in the roadway.
IgorPolishchuk,oneofthe men
placing the tires, said the crowd
intended to show its peaceful
opposition to the protests that
have pushed the country into a
political crisis and complained
that police had done little against
the protesters.
"It's a critical mass in there,
without control," he said. "The
authorities aren't anywhere
inside."
Protesters from the anti-
government side stood atop the
three-meter (10-foot) barricade
and members of the protest
camp's self-defense marshaled,
many of them carrying metal
shields and protectingtheir heads
with cycling or hockey headgear.
After about two hours, the
protesters' opponents pulled
back, with the self-defense
volunteers following, banging
their shields with rods in an
eerie imitation of the technique
used by the country's feared riot
police.
After riot police violently
dispersed two of the early
protest rallies, crowds swelled
- sometimes exceeding 100,000
people - and the protest issues

expanded to denunciation of
police brutality and calls for the
resignation of President Viktor
Yanukovych.
The protests began in late
November after Yanukovych
backed away from an agreement
to deepen ties with the European
Union and pursue closer relations
with Russia. A wide swath
of Ukrainian society resents
Russia's long dominance or
influence on Ukraine and avidly
supports integration with the EU
as a way to bolster democracy and
human rights.
Many of the demonstrators
who challenged the protesters'
barricade on Saturday wore St.
George's ribbons, a traditional
Russian military emblem.
Yanukovych's strongest support
is in the Russian-speaking
eastern part of the country.
Yanukovych met Russian
President Vladimir Putin
on Friday on the sidelines of
the opening day of the Sochi
Olympics. No details of the
meeting were made public.
After Yanukovych shelved the
EU deal, Russia agreed to a $15
billion financial aid package to
Ukraine; his opponents fear that
was a prelude to joining a trade
bloc that Moscow is leading as a
counterweight to the EU.

After two consecutive years of
trying and failing to secure a spot
on the team, he made it onto the
squad as a walk-on and continued
to serve as its co-captain until his
graduation, leaving the University
with a bachelor's degree in sports
management.
After his basketball career
ended, Merritt said he discovered
his passion for education and
fashion and decided to start a
social venture that would be
the confluence between the
two. Merit, his charity-focused
fashion brand, currently donates
20 percent of all proceeds to help
fund college scholarships for
students in Detroit.
As the talk progressed,
Merritt shared his experiences
and coupled them with sports
metaphors such as "your defense
is your best offense." For instance,
Merritt said his initial defensive
approach toward his idea and his
lack of trust of others did not allow
him to gain perspective and insight
from others.
However, when he began open-
ing up his idea to more perspec-
tives, Merritt said he learned that
his venture needed a greater focus.

aims to keep people interested
in the Irish culture. One of the
dances Deloney choreographed
included the song "What Does
the Fox Say?" by Ylvis, during
which performers wore animal
masks.
"We try to combine tradi-
tional music with modern music,
so within our show you'll find
some completely old-school Irish
dance steps mixed in with some
fun steps," Deloney said.
Engineering junior Emma
Backman, dance director at
L6im, said the group does not
incorporate hip-hop, ballet or
any other styles, but instead

"What has really done good for
me is having the desire to learn
from people, to not know it all," he
said. "You need to learn from peo-
ple who have been where you are
trying to go."
He additionally challenged the
studentsinthe audiencetoquestion
"Why?" as they go on to develop
their ventures. Merritt presented
a video, which displayed a series of
statistics regarding education, one
of which was that every26 seconds
a student drops out of high school.
He cited this fact as his inspiration
for working toward entrepreneur-
ship and social change.
Taking his vision further,
Merritt began his own education
program, FATE, to help
academically develop a selected
cohort of students in Detroit.
During the lecture, Paul Sagi-
naw, owner of Zingerman's Deli
and one of Merritt's mentors
through the process, came out and
spoke of Merritt's accomplish-
ments. He said he chose to become
Merritt's mentor since he admires
character over talent or other acco-
lades.
"I think he lives his life with a
lot of life, love and gratitude and he
started a business in what I believe
is a very pure way," Saginaw said.
"(It was) not to maximize his
profits but to give a better life to
people who are often left behind."

popular songs for the audience's
enjoyment.
"Usually I come up with a
vision and then work from my
vision to pick a song, listen to the
music, and think of things that
I've seen before in competitions
and what looks good on stage,"
Backman said.
Additionally, Deloney said
song choice often dictates the
performers' outfits, which
include traditional Irish garb.
"We by no means wear the
thousand-dollar competition
dresses, but we have traditional
Irish skirts," Deloney said.
Deloney added that Lgim is

Haley Gire, recruitment and

important for administratorq

dents beyond orientation. For
her goal, she suggested insti
tuting a strong student ambas
sador program for transfers as
a way to keep communication
open with administrators.
"We need better
communication with student
before they get here, and alsoa
network for them once they'r
here," she said.
Business sophomore Sarah
Beatty wrote down a similar
goal. She said that Transfer
Connections - a studenl
mentor program that placesa
group of LSA transfer student;
with a mentor - is a usefu
program, but is only open
to LSA students. Beatty said
expanding this plan to other
schools in the University would
be helpful to a business studen
such as herself.
Mesman said Saturday'
symposium was important for
fostering future collaboration
between students ant

no Irish dance experience prior
to college, and I've been dancing
now for four years."
LSA freshman Katie Loftus
said she has not danced since
before high school but decided to
get involved when she saw L6im
on campus.
"I'm lucky because I did it
before, so that kind of came back
quickly," Loftus said. "But for
other people who have never
done it before, it's amazing that
they can pick it up as quickly as
they did."
One of the hosts between
acts was University alum Maura
Villhauer, who said she was
a member of Lfim during her
junior and senior years and
misses being part of the group.
"I just love that they called me

"Thatrstudent-administrator
contact doesn't happen as
much as it should," he said.
"The goal was really to get that
I feedback from students and get
administrators to realize that
s the policies they enact have real
s effects on real people."
Gire said the symposium
r was a valuable experience for
- an administrator to connect
- directly with the students.
s "It was eye-opening, espe-
cially for the administrators in
the room, to hear the realities
r of what could happen and what

a she said. "It was one of the most

"Their feet move so fast,"
Kaiser said. "I like how they
integrated songs that were non-
traditional from what I would
think of as Irish music."
Near the end of the evening,
Deloney was one of the members
who were invited to the stage to
be honored in a senior sendoff.
"All in all, I'm really happy
with how the group's going and
I'm happy to be passing it off the

Rain to come to
California after
long drought

Winter weather
comes after long
season of dryness
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Californians accustomed to
complaining about the slight-
est change in the weather wel-
comed a robust weekend storm
that soaked the northern half
of the drought-stricken state
Saturday even as rain and snow
brought the threat of avalanch-
es, flooding and rock slides.,
In Willits, one of 17 rural
communities that California's
Department of Public
Health recently described as
dangerously low on water, City
Councilman Bruce Burton
said he was cheered seeing the
water levels in a local reservoir
and his backyard pond creeping
up and small streams flowing
again. The city in the heart of
redwood country usually sees
about 50 inches of rain a year
and was expected to get about
4 inches by Sunday.
"It's guarded optimism. We
are a long ways from where we
need to be, but we have to start
with some sort of a raindrop,"
Burton said.
The storm that moved in
Thursday, powered by a warm,
moisture-packed system from
the Pacific Ocean known as a
Pineapple Express, dropped
more than 11 inches of rain on
Marin County's Mt. Tamalpais
and on the Sonoma County
town of Guerneville by late
Saturday afternoon, National
Weather Service forecaster Bob
Benjamin said. Meanwhile, San
Francisco, San Jose and other
urban areas recorded 1 to 3
inches of rain.
With areas north of San
Francisco forecast to see anoth-

er few inches by Sunday, the
downpour, while ample enough
to flood roadways and prompt
warnings that parched streams
could be deluged to the point of
overflowing, by itself will not
solve the state's drought wor-
ries, National Weather Service
hydrologistMark Strudley said.
"The yearly rainfall around
here, depending on where you
were, was less than 10 percent
of normal," he said. "The
additions from this last series of
storms and the totals are taking
a dent out of it, but it is not a
significant dent."
The storm deposited a foot
of snow for Lake Tahoe ski
resorts that have relied on man-
made snow for much of the
season, and elevations above
7,500 feet were expected to get
another foot or two by Sunday,
said Holly Osborne, a National
Weather Service meteorologist
in Sacramento.
The additions, which
followed some brief periods of
snow in the last week, already
have improved the outlook for
the Sierra Nevada snowpack,
which provides about a third of
California's water supply.When
state surveyors last checked on
Jan. 30, the snowpack was at 12
percent of normal for this time
of winter. By Saturday, it was at
17 percent of normal.
"At least we are getting
something versus nothing,"
Osborne said.
While the fresh snow
delighted skiers and resort
operators, the Sierra Avalanche
Center warned Saturday that
the danger of avalanches, both
natural and human-triggered,
was high ina wide swath of the
central Sierra Nevada because
wind had blown new snow onto
weak layers of existing ice and
rock.

SMOKING
From Page 1A
ordinance, only the county's
health department has the power
to enforce the law. Under the
newly proposed city ordinance,
the Ann Arbor Police Department
would enforce it as well.
While the current ordinance
enforces a $50 fine for anyone
caught smoking in a smoke-
free area, councilmembers are
working on language for the
law that makes it clear that law
enforcement must first ask the
smoker to move in the form of a
verbal warning before giving any
citation.
The Council voted last week to
postpone any vote on the matter
for another month.
Councilmember Chuck
Warpehoski (D-Ward 5), the
sponsor of the ordinance, said
one of his reasons for calling to
postpone the vote was to ensure
clarity in the ordinance's intent.
"We're not trying to rack up a
lot of ticket revenue; we're trying
to create smoke-free areas,"
Warpehoski said. "If somebody's

smoking and we tell them to put
it out or move and they do that,
that's what we want. We don't
want to go around handing out
tickets for this. We just want
clean air."
The law would also allow the
city administrator to declare
some areas of Ann Arbor
parks to be smoke-free zones.
This matter created some
confusion, Warpehoksi said. He
emphasized that the ordinance
would not ban smoking in all
Ann Arbor parks.
Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) said she does not want
to see smoking outlawed in all
Ann Arbor parks and hopes City
Council will retain the power to
decide on that issue.
"I'm not comfortable with
simply granting authority to the
administrator to decide on the
parks," Lumm said. "I think it
should be a Council decision."
Lumm added that the law
may have the potential to harm
citizens' rights.
"If someone wants to just sit
on a park bench or walk through
the park (with a cigarette), are we
going to ban that?" Lumm said.
"We all want a healthy, smoke-

free environment, but I just want
to make sure we're doing it right
and not going overboard."
Lumm said she believes the
police "have more important
things to do" than enforce
smoking laws, and suggested
focusing on areas where there
are problems rather than broadly
enforcing the law.
She added that the postpone-
ment was necessary due to a
lack of clarity and input from the
Parks Advisory Committee, the
Ann Arbor Area Transportation
Authority and the business com-
munity. However, she said she
would most likely support the
final draft of the ordinance.
In addition to the bars and
restaurants that have become a
smoke-free standard, Atlanta,
Georgia is among other cities
that have already chosen to
implement stricter guidelines
for public smoking. According
to CBS News, since mid-2013,
city-owned parks and public
beaches, college campuses and
other outdoor venues have been
under a smoking ban, because of
the danger second-hand smoke
is thought to pose, especially to
children.

A good first step
Snyder's budget plan increases funding, but leaves green energy behind
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder recently unveiled his plan for the state's
2014-2015 budget. His recommendations include a 6.1-percent
increase in higher education funding, the allocation of $120 million
to the state's Rainy Day Fund, and $120 million toward covering extra Medicaid
costs. Snyder's plan also calls for retroactive tax relief, a $322-million increase
in K-12 school funding and $97 million toward environmental protection and
the improvement of water quality. While it is good that Snyder's latest budget
focuses on health, human services and education, the recent surplus money and
Rainy Day Fund should be used to invest in renewable energy.

Snyder's budget increases higher education
funding. By tying these funds to limits on tuition
increases, Snyder provides incentives for colleges
to keep education affordable. Thirty percent of
Snyder's proposed budget focuses on education,
includingsupport for both universities and K-12
schools. Currently, the funding formula for
higher education links funding to performance,
which has proven ineffective. In the case of
Wayne State University, performance-based
funding has failed to cover the needs of all
students and has forced the university to raise
tuition in lieu of receiving the funds. In addition
to increasing funding to higher education,
Snyder should review existing institutions and
their effectiveness.
It is important that Michigan's workforce
receive the attention it needs, especially in
terms of liability and health obligations. The
budget suggests prefunding the Michigan
Public School Employees Retirement System,
reducing unfunded liability from $46 billion
down to $31 billion. Though this year's budget
will not eliminate unfunded liability entirely,
Snyder has assured the state that progress is
being made. Medicaid expansion is also being
addressed under the new budget with a call
for a $12.3-billion allocation for health care.
This money will be dispersed to 2.2 million
Michigan residents. Funding the health of
Michigan residents is crucial to ensuring the
productivity of Michigan's economy.
In light of his failing Sierra Club rating,
Snyder has proposed environmental and

energy investments; however, he could make
an even greater commitment to green energy.
Rather than maintaining a stagnant Rainy Day
Fund, Snyder could further his development
of renewable energy by weaning Michigan off
harmful fossil fuels. In Snyder's State of the
State address, he pushed for more discussion
on green energy, but only a small portion of
his budget will go toward this area. Snyder
should put more money into the development of
wind turbines, solar energy and other sources
instead ofhousing it in the Rainy Day Fund.
In respect to his budget proposal, Snyder has
worked to appease both parties of the state
government, despite it being an election year.
While his Republican colleagues argues that
this Rainy Day Fund is a result of over-taxation
and that much of the money should be returned
to taxpayers, Snyder is opposed to tax cuts. He
has instead proposed increasing motor fuel
taxes from 19 to 33 cents per gallon, enabling a
$728-million raise in the 2014-2015 fiscal year.
He plans to maintain or raise tax standards in
an effort to further improve health, education
and human services, and he should be
commended for it.
For the most part, Snyder's new budget plan
emphasizes what is important to Michigan
residents. Unfortunately, Snyder still has a
reputation of cutting spending from education.
If he is reelected, Snyder's future budget plans
need to continue to allocate funding for higher
education and health, while pushing the
envelope in renewable energy.

couple of weeks ago, before
I sent in my last article, I
texted my mom and asked
if she thought
publishing what
I had written was
a good idea,
She respond-
ed: "I don't think
that you should
share personal
information
that can be used SOPHIA
against you. You USOW
don't want to
do something
that 10 years down the line you'll
deeply regret."
. Translation: This will come up
when people search your name
on Google.
At first, I shrugged her off. But I
found her plea coming back to me
in quiet, in-between times. Before
bed and on the frigid walk to class I
would wonder to myself: What if she
is right? What if telling my story will
make me unhireable, unlovable and
unstable in the eyes of people whose
respect and trust I'll eventually
need? I worried that instead of the
transparent future I hoped for, being
an adult meant more secret-keeping.
More feeling ashamed. More lying
and saying again and again that
everything was all right so insurance
costs stay down and my future boss
will give me a promotion instead of,
say, Jerry - my cubicle-mate, an avid
Limp Bizkit fan and father of three.
If I followed my mom's advice,
it would mean buckling to the
standards of whomever she was
afraid of. I'd publish nothing
inflammatory. I'd hold onto my cards
and show them only to those who
promised not to tell the graduate
school admissions board or the CEO
of PepsiCo what I should have been
too scared to tell all of you.
But now it's too late.
After I published the article I was
contacted by one of my friends, a bril-
liant student with high cheekbones
and cat eyes, who had also struggled

with an eating disorder. She said she
appreciated the article and that she
wished she could write about her own
experiences. When o encouraged her
to do so, however, she replied no,
never. She said thatshe had only talk-
ed about her disease with two people
other than me. One, an ex-boyfriend,
told her she was "disgusting." The
other, a coworker who she thought
was a close friend, told their boss,
who (in a Philadelphia-esque display
of bigotry) fired her for being "men-
tally unfit" to work for his company.
Mentally unfit? Disgusting? My
friend is anything but. She's the kind
of whip-smart, intimidatingly beau-
tiful woman whoIhope will someday
survey my manuscript/audit/equa-
tion and say, "This is shit. Get out of
my office." I look up to her, and to
hear her be so unequivocally humili-
ated and demonized for a disease she
has the strength to even admit to, let
alone fight, was unimaginable to me.
Perhaps the negative responses
she received mirror the fact that eat-
ing disorders are
seen as bench-
marks for shal-
low, irreversible
female weak- Should ,
nesses. Take,
for instance, content'
the case of John
Prescott, former silei
Deputy Prime
Minister of the
United King-
dom. In the
spring of 2008 he admitted publicly
to having struggled with bulimia
since the 1980s. He said he had kept
quiet about his disease "out of shame
... or embarrassment ... just because
it's such a strange thing for someone
like me to confess to. People normal-
ly associate (eating disorders) with
young women - anorexic girls, mod-
els trying to keep their weight down,
or women in stressful situations,
like Princess Diana." Prescott was
praised for the bravery of his admis-
sion. It was one thing for a woman
to be immature and vain enough

to binge and purge - but an impor-
tant politician? That was something.
Medical professionals and charity
groups heralded Prescott's confes-
sion as a step forward in terms of eat-
ing disorder awareness, despite the
fact that Prescott said he felt like a
"right twerp" while sitting in a doc-
tor's waiting room in which he was
the only man. Nobody questioned
his past leadership as Deputy Prime
Minister because of his disease.
Nobody branded him as "mentally
unfit." Nobody asked him to leave.
it's my friend and I who are the
disgusting ones. No matter how hard
we work and how smart, compas-
sionate and driven we may be, we are
the ones who must hide deep under
layers of hurt and shame, never for-
getting our failure. Take that pro-
motion, Jer, you deserve it. You're a
real adult and we're just broken toys
- wind-up monkeys who don't flip or
do tricks, but instead just stand and
shake. We're teddy bears with only
one button eye. We're Barbies made
out of lead. You
gettin' this, Jer?
Wedon'twakeup

present "they"
that likes steaks

handle the Internet addictions or
ugly birthmarks that come in the
package of imperfect creation?
Should we just be content with
our silence? I, for one, am tired of

that makes us believe that nooian

of eating disorder has the power to

Power of five

The truth behind the ACA

The scene is familiar, even if you haven't seen
the film. It's the first day of class and a professor
pronounces: "Look to your left. Now look to your
right.At the end of this class, only two of you will
be left." The sentiments behind such statements
(supposedly characteristic of rigorous law school
training) waft in and out of most classrooms
and they lodge deep in our minds: "Am I good
enough? is my seatmate smarter than me? What
if I don't make it?"
What lies behind that intimidating phrase
might be "rigor and challenge." But it is also
competition and anxiety. These things breed
what we also find in that half-remembered,
half-imagined film scene: people one-upping
each other and cheating on friendship in an
atmosphere of general nastiness.
I have better ambitions for my classroom
and my campus, and I suspect that you do
too. How about this phrase instead: "Look to
your left. Now look to your right. If any one
of us is not here (and not thriving) at the end
of this class, it will be our collective failure."
That's a very different attitude. It emphasizes
not competition, but responsibility. The
University, at its best, is a responsible
community of teachers and learners. Our
ideal should be that we look out for one
another, that we take collective responsibility
for every single one of our members.
That is an ideal thatalways lies in the distance.
Because we're busy. We already have our friends.
Because this kind of care takes work. Because
some of us - many of us - are shy, nervous and
fearfulofrejection.AsIwalk across campus,Itry
to make eye contact and smile. Too often, no one
looks up. I say "hello." Silence, or surprise. It's all
a little awkward, isn't it? And I'm no better. Too
often, it's easier for me to look at the ground as
well, ortto stare straight ahead into nothingness
because I'm so very lost in my music or my
thoughts. I think we can do better. We should
aspire to do so.
I've been thinking lately about "paying
it forward" in the form of "drive-through
generosity,"in which people in fast-food lines pay
for the food of the car - or the person - behind
them. There was, for example, that moment in
Manitoba when 228 consecutive cars paid it
forward at aTim Hortons drive-through.
Along with some friends and colleagues, I've
been wondering what it would look like for us

to venture something similar at the University.
Those thoughts have been echoed by a gener-
ous donor - an LSA alum - interested in driving
positive change on campus. He encouraged us to
take a chance, and he supported us in doing so.
Today, Feb. 10, marks the first day of a project
sponsored by LSA, #powerof5, which aims to
explore the possibility that a group of individuals
can build a movement to effect change in our
campus environment. The #powerof5 project
begins with 1,000 students in five large classes
in psychology, anthropology, sociology and
philosophy. Each will receive the means - one $5
bill and five cards encouraging acts of kindness.
Five smiles, five hellos, five handshakes, five
high-fives, five thank yous. It could be that
someone buys your meal or your coffee this
week. Or does something else - out of the clear
blue - that makes your day. That person might
be shy, nervous and fearful of rejection, and
so he or she will hand you a #powerof5 card,
which will ask you to pay it forward, to extend a
simple social gesture to a fellow human being. It
could be a smile, a few words, a greeting. Better,
though, will be for the two of you to talk, if only
for a moment. Nothing permanent. No lasting
obligation other than to receive kindnesses and
to continue to pay them forward to someone else.
The power of five: Five classes. Five dollars.
Five acts. Five passings of a little blue #powerof5
card. It could get exponential. It could get viral
- and not online, but in the real world where
we live with one another. We could, collectively,
take a crack - during the coldest and snowiest
seasononcampus- atcreatingathick,pervasive
atmosphere of warmth at the University. Why
not? And why not take the conversation online
too, by using the hashtag #powerof5 to share
your stories and experiences, or submit them to
our Tumbir?
The next time you are in class and look to your
left and to your right, think of yourself not in
competition, but in support.You are a responsible
member of a community that extends kindness to
all its members. So you pay it forward, five times
and then five times after that. And then let's see
what happens.

t seemed as if Christmas came
a little late for Republicans
last week when a report by
the nonpartisan
Congressional
Budget Office
estimated that
the Affordable
Care Act would
result in a
reduction of
approximately
2.5 million PATRICK
jobs by 2024. MAILLET
Every notable
Republican made,
their way in front of a camera and
declared yet another victory against
the evils of the ACA.
Unfortunately, the report's
findings appear to be alittle different
than the GOP would have liked.
The day after the report was
released, CBO Director Douglas
Elmendorf cleared up some questions
at the House Budget Committee
hearing. While Committee
Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had
cited the report by saying the ACA
"will push 2.3 million people out of
the workforce," Elmendorf stated
that the reduction in jobs would be
a result of people choosing to work
fewer hours, and that the report
actually suggests that the ACA will
reduce unemployment.
In our current system, people are
working more hours and sometimes
multiple jobs in an effort to pay for
health insurance. Instead of having
to work multiple jobs to pay off a
health insurance plan that doesn't
cover preexisting conditions or even
certain emergency treatments, the
ACA will allow people to spend more
time focusing on excelling in their
career instead of stagnating and
working multiple, low-paying jobs
with little upward mobility. In fact,
these people are now more likely to
afford an education or even save up
to open a small business - the true
engine of the American economy.

WALTER BIRI/AP
Voters stand in line to vote in Zurich, Switzerland on Sunday. Swiss voters were being asked to decide on a proposal to cap
immigration to the Alpine republic, a long-standing demand of Switzerland's most powerful party SVP.
Voters narrowly approve
Swiss immigration limits

New policy may
have negative
implications for
Swiss-EU relations
GENEVA (AP) - Voters in
Switzerland narrowly backed
a proposal to limit immigra-
tion Sunday, in a blow for
the government after it had
warned that the measure could
harm the Swiss economy and
relations with the European
Union.
The decision follows a suc-
cessful last-minute campaign
by nationalist groups that
stoked fears of overpopulation
and rising numbers of Muslims
in the Alpine nation.
Opinion polls before the vote
put opponents of the plan in the
leadbut asballotdayneared the
gap began to close.
Swiss public television SRF
reported that some 50.3 percent
of voters eventually backed the

proposal to introduce quotas for
all types of immigrants. About
49.7 percent voted against it, a
difference of fewer than 30,000
votes. Support was particularly
strong in rural areas, while cit-
ies such as Basel, Geneva and
Zurich rejected the proposal.
"This has far-reaching con-
sequences for Switzerland...and
our relations with the European
Union," Justice Minister Sim-
onetta Sommaruga said after
the vote. "It's a shift away from
the current system of free move-
ment of people."
Although Switzerland isn't
a member of the EU it enjoys
close ties to the 28-nation bloc.
Bern has painstakingly negoti-
ated a series of bilateral agree-
ments with Brussels, including
one that allowed most of the
EU's 500 million citizens to live
and work in Switzerland with
little formality. Swiss citizens,
in turn, could do the same in the
European Union.
Under Swiss law the govern-
ment now has to renegotiate its

treaty on the free movement of
people, though it is still unclear
what kind of caps will be placed
on immigration, and when.
Switzerland already introduced
quotas for immigrants from
eight central and eastern Euro-
pean nations two years ago.
The latest decision is likely
to have much more far-reach-
ing consequences though, as
hundreds of thousands of well-
educated foreigners from Ger-
many, France, Italy and other
EU countries work in Switzer-
land.
Ahead of Sunday's referen-
dum business groups warned
that many of the 80,000 people
who moved to Switzerland last
year are vital for the country's
economy, and curtailing immi-
gration further could cost
Swiss citizens' jobs too.
The Swiss Bankers Associa-
tion expressed disappointment
at the vote. "We urgently need
to hold constructive talks with
the EU to explain our posi-
tion," it said.

Same-sex couples
to receive new legal
ights and protections

Federal decision will
allow spouses to not
testify against one
another in court
WASHINGTON (AP) - In an
assertion of same-sex marriage
rights, Attorney General Eric
Holder is applying a landmark
Supreme Court ruling to the Jus-
tice Department, announcing
Saturday that same-sex spouses
cannot be compelled to testify
against each other, should be eli-
gible to file for bankruptcy joint-
ly and are entitled to the same
rights and privileges as federal
prison inmates in opposite-sex
marriages.
The Justice Department runs
a number of benefits programs,
and Holder says same-sex cou-
ples will qualify for them. They
include the September 11th Vic-
tim Compensation Fund and
benefits to surviving spouses of
public safety officers who suffer
catastrophic or fatal injuries in
the line of duty.
"Ineverycourthouse, in every
proceeding and in every place
where a member of the Depart-
ment of Justice stands on behalf
of the United States, they will
strive to ensure that same-sex
marriages receive the same priv-
ileges, protections and rights as
opposite-sex marriages under
federal law," Holder said in pre-
pared remarks to the Human
Rights Campaign in New York.
The advocacy group works on
behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender equal rights.
Just as in the civil rights
struggles of the 1960s, the stakes
in the current generation over
same-sex marriage rights "could
not be higher," said Holder.
"The Justice Department's
role in confronting discrimina-
tion must be as aggressive today
as it was in Robert Kennedy's
time," Holder said of the attor-
ney general who played a lead-

ership role in advancing civil
rights.
Human Rights Campaign
President Chad Griffin said
Holder's "landmark announce-
ment will change the lives of
countless committed gay and
lesbian couples for the better.
While the immediate effect of
these policy decisions is that
all married gay couples will be
treated equally under the law,
the long-term effects are more
profound.
Today, our nation moves clos-
er toward its ideals of equality
and fairness for all."
Holder's speech was criticized
by the conservative National
Organization for Marriage.
"This is just the latest in a
series of moves by the Obama
administration, and in particu-
lar the Department of Justice,
to undermine the authority and
sovereignty of the states to make
their own determinations regu-
lating the institution of mar-
riage," said Brian Brown, the
group's president.

Iran insists it never worked

the U.N'.s International Atomic
Energy Agency was pushing
ahead with its investigation
with expectations that Tehran
would continue to assert that
all of its activities it is ready to
reveal were meant for peaceful
nuclear use.

Still, the IAEA's announce-
ment that Tehran was ready
to "provide information and
explanations" for experiments
in a type of detonator that the
agency says could be used to
trigger a nuclear explosion
appeared to be the latest indi-
cation that Iran's new political
leadership is seeking to ease
tensions over its nuclear pro-
gram.

Scientists discover
800,000-year-old
footprints in England

Find indicates
widespread human
activity outside Africa
LONDON (AP) - They were
a British family on a day out -
almost amillionyears ago.
Archaeologists announced
Friday that they have discovered
human footprints in England that
are between 800,000 and 1 mil-
lion years old - the most ancient
found outside Africa, and the
earliest evidence of human life in
northern Europe.
A team from the British Muse-
um, London's Natural History
Museum and Queen Mary college
atthe UniversityofLondonuncov-
ered imprints from up to five indi-
viduals in ancient estuary mud
at Happisburgh on the country's
eastern coast.
British Museum archaeologist
Nick Ashton said the discovery -
recounted in detail in the journal
PLOS ONE - was "a tangible link
to our earliest human relatives."
Preserved in layers of silt and
sand for hundreds of millennia

before being exposed by the tide
last year, the prints give a vivid
glimpse of some of our most
ancient ancestors. They were left
by a group, including at least two
children and one adult male. They
could have been be a family for-
aging on the banks of a river sci-
entists think may be the ancient
Thames, beside grasslands where
bison, mammoth, hippos and rhi-
noceros roamed.
University of Southampton
archaeology professor Clive Gam-
ble, who was not involved in the
project, said the discovery was
"tremendously significant."
"It's just so tangible," he said.
"This is the closest we've got to
seeing the people.
"When I heard about it, it was
like hearing the first line of (Wil-
liam Blake's hymn) 'Jerusalem'
- 'And did those feet, in ancient
time, walk upon England's moun-
tains green?' Well, they walked
upon its muddy estuary."
The researchers said the
humans who left the footprints
may have been related to Homo
antecessor, or "pioneer man,"
whose fossilized remains have

been found in Spain. That species
died out about 800,000 years ago.
Ashton said the footprints are
between 800,000 - "as a conser-
vative estimate" - and 1 million
years old, at least 100,000 years
older than scientists' earlier esti-
mate of the first human habita-
tion in Britain. That's significant
because 700,000 years ago, Brit-
ain had a warm, Mediterranean-
style climate. The earlier period
was much colder, similar to mod-
ern-day Scandinavia.
Natural History Museum
archaeologist Chris Stringer said
that 800,000 or 900,000 years
ago Britain was "the edge of the
inhabited world."
"This makes us rethink our feel-
ings about the capacity of these
early people, that they were coping
with conditions somewhat colder
than the present day,"he said.
"Maybe they had cultural adap-
tations to the cold we hadn't even
thought were possible 900,000
years ago. Did they wear cloth-
ing? Did they make shelters,
windbreaks and so on? Could
they have the use of fire that far
back?" he asked.

Hungarian Jewish group to
boycott Holocaust memorials

Members say they
will not participate
in government
sponsored events
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)
- The Federation of Hungar-
ian Jewish Communities said
Sunday it will boycott all gov-
ernment events commemorat-
ing the 70th anniversary of the
Holocaust in Hungary unless the
government cancels some of the
planned memorials.,
The dispute stems from his-
torical and ideological differenc-
es between the federation and

Government forces
gain upper hand as
rebels restricted to
small neighborhoods
BEIRUT (AP) - Hundreds of
civilians were evacuated Sunday
from the besieged Syrian city of
Homs, braving gunmen spraying
bullets and lobbing mortar shells
to flee as part of a rare three-day
truce to relieve a choking block-
ade. Dozens were wounded as
they fled.
The cease-fire came as Syrian
officials arrived in Switzerland
for a new round of talks with
opposition activists-in-exile to
try to negotiate an end to Syria's
three-year conflict.
More than 600 people were
evacuated from Homs on Sun-
day, said Governor Talal Bar-
razi. The operation was part of a
U.N.-mediated truce that began
Friday between the government
of President Bashar Assad and
armed rebels to allow thousands
of women, children and elderly
men to leave opposition-held
parts of the city, and to permit
the entry of food and supplies.
Forces loyal to Assad have
blockaded rebel-held parts of
Homs for over a year, causing
widespread hunger and suffer-
ing.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's
government about the yearlong
series of remembrances centered
on the 1944 deportation of more
than 430,000 Hungarian Jews to
Nazi death camps.
"The known plans do not take
into account the arguments or
the sensitivity of the victims of
the horrors of the Holocaust,"
the group said, adding that there
had been "no substantive prog-
ress on the government side in
the dispute over the Hungarian
Holocaust Memorial Year." The
federation voted 76-2 in favor of
the boycott, with three absten-
tions.
Mazsihisz, the federation's
Hungarian acronym, wants the

government to abandon plans to
build a memorial of Nazi Ger-
many's 1944 invasion of Hunga-
ry and a project dedicated to the
child victims of the Holocaust.
The "House of Fates" memo-
rial is being built at a Budapest
railway station from which Jews
were deported to Nazi death
camps. The memorial honoring
children will include an exhibit
and education center, and Mazsi-
hisz said it has been sidelined
from the project, whose "histori-
cal approach remains unknown"
to the federation's experts.
Mazsihisz fears both memo-
rials will downplay the role of
Hungary and Hungarians in the
Holocaust.

Dozens of people were wound-
ed when they came under fire as
they waited at an agreed-upon
evacuation point in the rebel-
held neighborhood of al-Qara-
bis, according to three activists
based in Homs, who spoke to The
Associated Press by Skype.
Despite the gunfire and
exploding mortar shells, hun-
dreds of women, children and
elderly men ran toward a group
of Red Crescent workers waiting
less than a mile (kilometer) away,
said an activist who gave his
name as Samer al-Homsy. The
Syrian activists said the gunfire
came from a government-held
neighborhood.
The Syrian news agency SANA
also reported that civilians came
under fire, but blamed "terror-
ists," the government term for
rebels.
At least four busloads of civil-
ians were shipped out, according
to footage broadcast on the Leb-
anese television station al-Maya-
deen. Wide-eyed children, their
prominent cheekbones sugges-
tive of malnutrition, tumbled out
of a bus, assisted by aid workers.
"Our life was a disaster, we
had no food, no water," one dis-
tressed woman said.
"There was nothing, my chil-
dren are all sick. They were
thirsty," she said, standingwith a
group of exhausted-looking chil-
dren as khaki-clad Syrian sol-

diers, Red Crescent workers in
red jump suits and U.N. workers
in blue protective vests gathered
around the buses.
Some evacuees were to be
hosted in government-run shel-
ters, others were going to join
relatives in safer areas, while
still others said they did not
know where they were going.
Khaled Erksoussi of the Syri-
an Red Crescent, which is assist-
ing the operation, told the AP
that the agency hoped to evacu-
ate as many civilians as possible
before the truce expires Monday.
On Saturday, gunmen opened
fire on civilians, leaving aid
workerswounded and two trucks
damaged, Erksoussi said, speak-
ing by telephone from Damascus.,
Despite the violence, the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refu-
'gees, Ant6nio Guterres, said
in a statement that the truce
showed "that even in the darkest
of nights it is possible to offer a
glimmer of hope to people in des-
perate need of assistance."
The Homs cease-fire was
arranged by U.N. mediator
Lakhdar Brahimi, who urged
the warring sides to aid the esti-
mated 2,500 civilians trapped in
the ancient, rebel-held quarters
known as Old Homs, to build
trust during the first face-to-face
meetings of government officials
and opposition figures in Swit-
zerland last month.

ill Rauhauser was
15 years old when
he bought his first
camera for 49 cents - saved
from his earnings from working
at a small
grocery
store in
Detroit, in
the 1930s.
Little did
he know at
the time,
he would PAIGE
continue PFLEGER
taking
photos for
the next
80 years, his craft evolving
from a hobby to a gratifying
and successful career that is
archived through film.
Rauhauser's story begins in
1918 in the heart of Detroit.
He attended Cooley High
School on the northwest side
of the city, then earned his
bachelor's in architectural
engineering from University
of Detroit. He worked in that
field for about 15 years while
pursuing photography on the
side.
In 1947, Rauhauser went on
a business trip to New York
City and visited the Museum
of Modern Art. He was partic-
ularly struck by an exhibit of
photos by Henri Cartier-Bres-
son, and purchased a book
about the photographer that
included the quote: "Photogra-
phy isn't a hobby. It is the art
of seeing."
At the time, photography
wasn't a popular art form, but
Rauhauser managed to con-
nect with other photographers
through camera clubs. It was
there that he met the chair of
the photography department
at College for Creative Studies,
and was offered a job teaching
the history of photography as a
night class.
"I knew right then and there
that I needed to quit my job
and I went to teach photog-
raphy," Rauhauser said. "I
became completely immersed
in Detroit's art world."

Rauhauser credits his wife
with his sudden and drastic
career move. Doris, a kin-
dergarten teacher in Detroit,
understood her husband's love
for photography and support-
ed him throughout their 60
years of marriage, even if he
was late to dinner because he
was combing the city streets in
search of the next great photo.
"We met when I was 20 and
she was 17," Rauhauser said.
"I went iceskating, and she
skated up to me and asked if
we could hold hands and skate
around the rink. We did, and
we were together ever since."
Rauhauser taught three
days a week, and continued
on for many years, teaching
at Wayne State University and
the University of Michigan.
The rest of his time was spent
walking the streets of Detroit
and taking photos of people
going about their every day
lives.
"Most of the work I did,
people didn't notice me at
all," Rauhauser said. "I kept a
low profile and was shooting
with a small camera. It was
very exciting to track down
and hunt for those moments
of real significance in people's
lives. I didn't pose anyone at
all. I wanted to have them
unknown, doing their thing,
but they could still produce
images that were significant'
to show life in Detroit."
His favorite photo is exem-
plary of his practice - a black
and white photo of a soldier
sitting on a bench in front of
the Detroit River. To the right
is a woman that he is kiss-
ing, and to the left is another
girl "just waiting her turn,"
as Rauhauser said. "It turned
out to be an interesting event."
The photo was placed into the
1955 City of Man exhibit at the
MoMA and has been in New
York ever since.
The product of this style of
street photography resulted in
a mass of photos spanning from
the '40s until present day, dis-
playing Detroiters at their best

and their worst with the back
drop of a city decaying behind
them. The change over time
is part of what draws people
to Rauhauser's work, and may
be the reason he was just cho-
sen as the sixth winner of the
Kresge Eminent Artist award
- an award given to an artist
that contributes to the cultural
community and shows dedica-
tion for the city of Detroit and
its residents. And if anyone
knows Detroiters, it's Rauhaus-
er, a man who has been study-
ing them his entire life.
"I kept taking photos until
I had to stop," he said. "But I
used to spend the whole day
walking from morning until
night, stopping for a cup of
coffee and then starting out
again."
Rauhauser has
a collection of
thousands of
unseen photos.
Though his age sometimes
prevents him from pursu-
ing such a rigorous shooting
schedule, Rauhauser still
takes photos, adding onto a
library of about eight to ten
thousand images that have yet
to be printed. He keeps very
busy, planning upcoming gal-
lery shows, going to dinner or
the opera, spending time with
old students and visiting his
hometown of Detroit.
Though the elm-tree lined
city of his youth looks little
like the city that stands today,
Rauhauser is still optimistic
that Detroit will rise again,
as its city motto suggests.
"You can see a change taking
place," he said. "You can see it
happen."

Why cherish disgraceful artists?

ByKARENYUAN
Daily Arts Writer
When Alaric Hunt wrote
for his novel's bio that he
was "currently serving a life
sentence," he wasn't being
figurative.
Huntwrotehis prize-winning
novel, "Cuts Through Bone,"
while imprisoned for starting
a fire that killed a woman. The
novel, which won a mystery-
writing contest in January,
also landed Hunt a publishing
contract and a $10,000 advance.
Rather than follow the adage of
"write what you know," Hunt
wrote a private-eye story aided
by information gleaned from
"Law & Order" episodes.
Hunt is able to earn money
from his book sales, which leads
to this much-debated question:
Should a criminal be allowed
to profit from his writing?
In this case, the art isn't the
artist - the novel's content is
not about Hunt's past crimes.
However, news of Hunt's prize
has distressed the family of
his victim, Joyce Austin. In an
interview with The New York
Times, Joyce's mother stated,
"Knowing this creates a lot of
emotions I don't want to deal
with."
How separately should we
view an artist and their work?
The dilemma of Hunt and his
novel echoes the controversy
surrounding another author,

illustrates the important note
that no one man can be solely
responsible for the atrocious
actions of many, I'm partial
to the idea that Hitler should
be shown as the little shit
that he was (i.e. "Inglourious
Basterds"), not as some
phantom or abstraction.
"The Monuments Men,"
like our founding fathers,
suffers for its patriotism.
The story pushes the United
States as the noble protector
of all the world's culture. And
Uncle Sam's grip gets tighter
and tighter as the film goes
on, culminating with a race
between our heroes and the
Russians, -an overt preamble
to the Cold War.
Another major violation
problem is that the plot
largely ignores the exploits
of actual soldiers in the
war. While the recovery and
restoration of the greatest
art in the world is surely an
admirable pursuit, the voice
of the film seems unaware of
the incredible scope of the
destruction of the war. There
are almost no combat scenes;
the war is simply a backdrop
to the greater purpose of the
protagonists.
"The Monuments Men"
ultimately fails because its
entertainment value is mild,
and in the end it' can't help
but feel like a bunch of old,
artistic yuppies explaining
why they're the real heroes of
WWII.

By REBECCA GODWIN
Daily Arts Writer
J. K. Rowling made waves
recently with the shocking rev-
elation that she believes she had
made a mistake in her seven-
book "Harry Potter" series by
having main characters Herm-
ione Granger and Ron Weasley
get married. In hindsight, she
believed that Hermione should
have ended up with none other
than the Boy Who Lived, Harry
Potter.
Naturally, the fandom erupt-
ed. The fans who believed in
the canonical pairing were out-
raged that Rowling would say
such things about their beloved
Romione. Others, who shipped,
which is the-internet's way of
saying supported, Harmony
(Harry and Hermione), claimed
superiority over the Romione
shippers, claiming they always
knew whom the true pairing
should have been. My reac-
tion was a bit more subdued; it
consisted only of a shrug of the
shoulders and a "Meh? Who
cares?"
My reaction, or lack thereof,
was not caused by apathy toward
the "Harry Potter" series. I love
Harry Potter and everything
about the Wizarding World.
I have read each of the books
several times and I will defend
them to anyone who claims the
books lack quality.
So why am I so unconcerned
with Rowling destroying Romi-
one? Because it doesn't mat-
ter. These relationships were
never a central part of the story,

and if they never existed or if minimally, as it always felt a bit
they changed, the story would forced. We never saw enough of

Ello, mate?
Romione vs. Harmony:
Why do we even care?

Besides, the relationships
were never that believable
to begin with. I never really
bought into the whole Romione
relationship. There was never
anything in the stories that
made me believe the pair had
longevity. Though, I did believe
it more than the whole Harry
and Ginny relationship, which
was just a mess. And to be fair -'
I believe it more than Harmony.
The only couple I actually
ever believed were meant to
be together was Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley. Their relationship
was grounded in love and car-
ing toward each other, and
the fact that Mr. Weasley calls
Mrs. Weasley "Mollywobbles"
is almost too cute for me to
handle. The Remus and Tonks
relationship I believed, but only

ing she can do about it - unless
she goes back and rewrites the
whole series, which seems a bit
excessive to me.
Here's to hoping
Snermione
comes true.
So Romione fans rejoice
because your pairing will
forever remain the OTP (one
true pairing) and Harmony will
only ever be wishful thinking,
like Snarry (Snape and Harry),
Drarry (Draco and Harry),
and Snermione (Snape and

When one
loss feels
like more
Outside the press room in Pegula
Ice Arena, a media director
stops Mac Bennett's walk to
the bus with a tug on his suit jacket to
come speak with
reporters.
Inside, Penn
State coach Guy
Gadowsky begins
to praise his team
for coming together
in Saturday's game.
He's commending
GREG his team for
GARNO bouncing back from
Friday night's game
to earn a win.
But outside, Bennett, the senior
defenseman, stands with his lips
pursed shut and his face drawn. He
wants to hide in his red headphones
and forget Saturday night's 4-0 loss to
the Nittany Lions.
Inside, Penn State goaltender Matt
Skoff calls the game something "he will
remember for a long time." He smiles,
and his coach smiles, and for the first
time since December all feels right in
Hockey Valley.
But outside, Bennett, a normally
talkative, optimistic player who spent 15
minutes talking to reporters earlier in
the week, takes just one minute and one
second to answer questions.
"It's frustrating," Bennett says,
looking up from his downward glance.
"How would you feel?"
Above the hallway the cleaning
crew clears the seats after 6,100 fans
stood on their feet and roared when
the Nittany Lions celebrated near their
own bench like they had just won the
Stanley Cup. The workers cleaned up
the popcorn remnants and thrown
pom-poms after the horn blared louder
and longer than any point in the game at
the end of regulation to celebrate Penn
State's first-ever win in the Big Ten
Conference.
Earlier that week, Bennett talked
about not being "that team" that gives
Penn State its first conference win, like
a baseball team becomes "that team"
that was no-hit.
Just one night earlier, Bennett,
along with Michigan coach Red
Berenson, said the 7-3 score of the
game prior wasn't indicative of how
his team played. They needed to shore
up defensive-zone coverage, Bennett
added.
Even after the first period Saturday,
he told ESPNU reporters that he felt
like his team could comeback from a
three-goal deficit that energized an
already loud Penn State fan base.
"We let up too many goals and we
didn't score any," he said frankly.
It wasn't the fact that Penn State
scored more goals and barely upset the
Wolverines, it's that the Nittany Lions
scored four goals and dominated them.
Penn State was there with a constant
forecheck and pressure in the neutral
zone. The Nittany Lions pushed the
puck forward where multiple forwards
waited around the crease to throw
pucks in the net.
There was Penn State forward David
Glen's first goal, for example, which

found its way in off an awkward angle,
or the second goal five minutes later
that Zach Saar banked off freshman
netminder Zach Nagelvoort.
Without agoal, Michigan never
really inspired hope that a comeback
could happen. Some shots, like
sophomore forward Boo Nieves'
attempt that rang off the post, came
close, but others never even threatened.
It wasn't just a loss, it was an
emphatic loss.
"I think everyone's mature enough
on this team to put this in the past,"
Bennett said.
But it's tough to remember much
from Friday's game after playing
through Saturday.
After the third goal, while fans
hugged one another, the music over the
speakers filled the arena and students
hit the glass and hollered at the
goaltender.
Penn State snapped Michigan's five-
game unbeaten streak on Saturday and
ruined its chance to move back into
second place in the Big Ten standings.

Michigan offenseflails with Stauskas silenced

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
IOWA CITY - Nik Stauskas isn't
much for expressing frustration. If
he's not playing well, he maintains
an even keel and keeps from voicing
displeasure. He's not willing to show
that he's been defeated, even if the
team has been.
So on days like Saturday at Carver-
Hawkeye Arena with Michigan getting
pummeled on the road, 85-67, you
wouldn't know from looking at the
sophomore guard that things weren't
going his way.
It wasn't that Stauskas was having
an off day, but rather that Iowa wasn't
even giving him a chance to have an
off day. For 35 minutes, Iowa guards
Roy Devyn Marble and Josh Oglesby
marked him closely. They denied the
ball when he'd make a cut toward the
ball, and they'd body him when he
tried to cut backdoor.
Just looking at Stauskas' stat line -
10 points on 50-percent shooting, you
wouldn't think it was a case of a star
player having an off game. More like a
role player playing a role-player game.
But make no mistake, the Hawkeyes
knew how important it was to make No.
11 in the blue jersey look like a role player.
"We were pretty much locked into
collectively going after Stauskas," said

Iowa coach Fran McCaffery.
Sixteen days after Stauskas battered
Iowa for a career-high 26 points, he
was unrecognizable Saturday with
a new man guarding him and a new
game plan from McCaffery.
Rather than sticking the big-bodied
Aaron White on Stauskas, Iowa would
follow Indiana and Michigan State's
lead and put its best athlete on the
star sophomore.
"What we did was we decided to
put Marble on him," McCaffery said.
"We thought that would be a better
match, and he was really good."
Marble limited Stauskas to six
field-goal attempts, zero assists and
four turnovers.
"I wasn't about to let him have
another 26-point effort against us,"
Marble said.
Just as Yogi Ferrell did last week
and Gary Harris the week before,
Marble guarded Stauskas tightly
throughout, but also had the game of
his season offensively. He scored 26
points with six 3-pointers, while 22
of those points came in the first half
with the game still in doubt.
"You've got to play both ends of the
court in order to be a great player,"
Marble said. "And I take pride in my
defense and trying to shut or contain
whoever the best player on the other
team is."

When he got his hands on the ball, the
tight defense, or maybe just the bottled-
up frustration forced Stauskas into
turnovers. His shake-and-bake dribble
that had turned Iowa into rubber a few
weeks ago had betrayed him. Twice
he dribbled off his foot and twice he
tried to makea pass to a Wolverine that
wasn't where he was expected to be.
"They made a lot of adjustments,"
Stauskas said. "They did some switches
on our ball screens and handoffs, which
made things difficult. They denied me
theball, andthenwhen Ididtryto drive,
all their guys were in the gaps. They
were trying to clog up the lane, which
made it tough for me to penetrate."
It's the third straight game that
Stauskas was held to 10 or fewer points
after having scored at least 12 in the
previous 12 games. Just as he was
emerging on the scene as a Big Ten
Player of the Year frontrunner, the
increased attention from opponents has
seemed to stymie his groove.
"I think all teams are starting to play
me like that," Stauskas said. "So it's
something I'm gonna get used to."
If this game was played at the
beginning of the season, the blame
for offensive woes wouldn't fall on
Stauskas. But as he has emerged as the
top offensive option, the team's success
in tough games appears to be strongly
correlated to Stauskas's performance.

In November, it seemed that
Robinson would bear a heavy
responsibility in the Wolverine
attack, but his inconsistent play has
rendered him an enigma - a player
with explosiveness, but who can't be
relied on from game to game. That
point was supported with his two-
point performance Saturday on 1-for-
7 shooting on the heels of a 23-point
game in Wednesday's blowout victory
over Nebraska.
Saturday, it was a pair of guards,
sophomore Caris LeVert and
freshman Zak Irvin, filling the
offensive void. Michigan finished
with 67 points, though even that
figure was inflated by late-game
apathy from the Hawkeyes. LeVert
was successful at dribble-driving his
way to 11 free-throw attempts and
22 points, while Irvin sustained his
lights-out shooting. He made seven of
his 12 shots for 19 points.
But to compete with Marble and the
high-octane Iowa attack, Michigan was
going to need more from its star player.
"I blame myself for that," Stauskas
said. "I think I haven't done my part
offensively. I know Caris and Zak, the
last couple games, they've done a great
job of stepping up and doing their fair
share. I think it just falls on me right
now. I've just got to be more aggressive
in finding ways to make it happen."

in what was a memorable
moment for the coach.
"For her to be here for a

"I actually thought we did

Barnes Arico said, praising
her team's ability to limit the
Boilermakers' ability to execute
their half-court offense.
The Wolverine defense
showed encouragingsigns oflife
early in the second half, holding
the Boilermakers without a field

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Separating an investigation and its response

In keeping with Michigan's
mishandling ofthe
aftermath of former kicker
Brendan Gibbons' expulsion
for sexual
misconduct,
Michigan
coach Brady
Hoke's press
conference on
Wednesday
was, again,
unacceptably
lacking. ZACH
Hoke had HELFAND
putouta
statement
to a secretive meeting of five
select news outlets Monday.
Asked again about the Gibbons
situation Wednesday, Hoke
made references to that nebulous
statement. He made a prolonged,
stern stare. He made more
references to that statement.
He talked freely about
recruiting - it was National
Signing Day, after all - but in
his first open press conference
after the Gibbons incident came
to light, he said almostnothing
at all. He said he has "no idea"
how student misconduct is
investigated. He said, of those
who feel the University is hiding
behind something, "That's your
opinion."
He said, again, "Did I give you
a statement?"
This was another misguided,
discomforting response to the
questions over how Michigan
handled allegations of sexual
misconduct against Gibbons.
But it has now become too
easy to confuse Michigan's
botched response for a botched
investigative process. The
Athletic Department and the
University still must answer
questions about that. But there
are two distinct issues here:
how the University pursues
charges of sexual misconduct,
and Michigan's unsettling lack of
transparency.
To be clear: The idea that
the University or the Michigan

"Fort Schembechler" - the
nickname bestowed upon the
football program's nothing-in-
nothing-out tendencies - is
nice for football games, but it
is less so for more important
matters.
So it comes with little
surprise that the Athletic
Department's first reaction was
to deny knowledge of Gibbons'
expulsion. It comes with little
surprise the University's first
reaction was to cite privacy
laws, despite the fact that they
explicitly exclude "a student
who is an alleged perpetrator
of any crime of violence ... or
a nonforcible sex offense." It
comes as little surprise that
Bill Martin, Michigan's athletic
director at the time the alleged
incident occurred, denied
knowledge of any incident
involving Gibbons. And it comes
as little surprise that at the first
public comments made by Hoke
followingthe Daily's reporton
Gibbons's expulsion, the Daily
and other outlets were not
invited. It matters little when the
press conference was initially
scheduled.
Still, all of this is evidence of a
mishandled response to Gibbons'
expulsion. That shouldn't be
confused for a cover-up or a delay
in investigating his misconduct.
Currently, no evidence supports
that claim.
We can't change how the
University investigated Gibbons
or anyone else in the past. But we
can engage in a debate over how
the University can better create
a safe space;while protecting
the rights of all involved. We can
ensure the other incidents, the
ones that don't involve football
players, are handled properly.
But that would require
transparency. The University
and the Athletic Department
have shown that's a non-starter.
Helfand can be reached

on Twitter @zhelfand

Michigan football coach Brady Hoke and the Michigan Athletic Department have responded poorly to the Brendan Gibbons case, writes Zach Helfand.

football team would in any way
obstruct or cover up sexual
misconduct allegedly committed
by Brendan Gibbons doesn't
seem logical.
Consider: Gibbons was, in
2009, a mediocre freshman
kicker who was in his redshirt
year; better players have been
kicked off or disciplined for less;
it doesn't make sense for Hoke to
risk his job by playing Gibbons
in an effectively meaningless
game against Iowa on Nov. 23
- a few days after a University
body found him responsible for
sexual misconduct. The Ann
Arbor police, apparently, did not
have enough to press criminal
charges.
The University's sexual
misconduct policy at the time
required a complainant to
initiate an investigation. Unless
a complainant came forward, the
University had no options. With
no action from the police or from

the University, the football team
did nothing.
In 2013, the same year the
University implemented its
new sexual misconduct policy,
Gibbons was investigated and
expelled.
To this point, the University
acted exactly as it should.
Assuming no complainant came
forward, it had no recourse
against Gibbons. The football
team refrained from punishing
someone who had not been
charged by the police or
investigated by the University.
When the new policy allowed,
the University took action.
Here, though, the questions
begin. When was the Athletic
Department notified?
And, more importantly: this
case receives public attention
because it involves a football
player. But what about the
others?
The most recent statistics

released by University Police
under the Clery Act, from 2012,
show 21 reports of forcible rape,
21 reports of forcible fondling
and three reports of sexual
assault with an object. Yet, there
were zero permanent separations
in the 2011-2012 academic year,
accordingto the recent data from
the Office of Student Conflict
Resolution. With the new policy
in place, what is being done about
the others? Why was Gibbons'
expulsion so rare?
There are answers to these
questions. The University owes
its students and stakeholders
the transparency that can
provide them.
Unfortunately, transparency
is not the default response for the
Michigan Athletic Department.
This is a university that,
according to a 2009 report by the
Daily, holds an unusually narrow
interpretation of Michigan's
Freedom ofInformation Act.

This is an athletic department
that gives no access to football
practices; limits player
availability to internally selected
players (Gibbons faced questions
just once in 2013, followinga
triple-overtime victory against
Northwestern on Nov. 16); and
prohibits contacting players'
families without department
consent.
Some Michigan sports are
more restrictive than others.
Nobody likes to hear reporters
complain about access. And when
we do complain, we are more
often concerned with writing
stories about depth charts
than with serving as a public
watchdog.
Would increased access to
Gibbons or other players or
families have shed any light on
his expulsion earlier? Maybe not.
What this does show, though,
is an athletic department
whose first reflex isto obscure.

Iowa drops Wolverines 7 .

Hawkeyes' Marble
scores 22 in half
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
IOWACITY- Outrebounded,
outhustled and outmuscled, the
No.10 Michiganmen'sbasketball
team couldn't silence the crowd
or stop Iowa, suffering its largest
loss of the season.
With the open concourse of
the Carver-Hawkeye Arena,
it's hard to contain the noise
that flows throughout the
building. As the sound carries,
hitting the ceiling and windows
paneling the concourse, the
volume seems to grow louder
and louder as action unfolds.
Hoping to contain or stop that
flow - highlighted by Iowa's
Roy Devyn Marble outstanding
performance in the first half -
proved to be impossible for the
Wolverines on Saturday.
"Iowa punched us early
today," said Michigan coach
John Beilein, "and it was hard
to respond."
After scoring 13 points in
the team's last meeting in
January, Marble poured in 14
of his team-high 26 points - on
four 3-pointers - in the game's
first 10 minutes to give the
Hawkeyes (7-4 Big Ten, 18-6
overall) a 14-point lead - one
they never looked back from in
their 85-67 win.
"We knew they were going to
come out strong," said sophomore
guard Nik Stauskas. "We knew

the crowd was going to be a big
part of this game. But that's the
same for any game inthe Big Ten.
It means what are we going to do
in response. And I think we did
an OK job at times but overall it
wasn'tgood enough."
As Iowa made six out of
its first seven triples, No. 10
Michigan (9-2, 17-6) made only
one of its first seven attempts.
"You know, it changes
everything," said Iowa coach
Fran McCaffery regarding
Iowa's hot start. "(Do) you shoot
threes? Do you not shoot threes?
Do you drive it? Do you grind it?
When you're behind, it changes
your entire approach."
Stauskas didn't score his first
basket of the game until 7:01 left
in the half, so the Wolverines
rode the hot hands of sophomore
guard Caris LeVert (22 points)
and freshman guard Zak Irvin
(19 points). Behind the duo,
Michigan was able to go on an
8-0 run to cut the lead to 33-25.
But Marble was there to silence
the Wolverines and ignite the
Hawkeye faithful as he had been
from the beginning of the game.
After making a three to end
Michigan's run, Marble made his
sixth triple - for 22 points in the
half - as time expired to end No.
17 Iowa's 7-0 run as it went up 14.
"That was a Player of the Year
candidate performance today,"
Beilein said. "Iowa is blessed
to have a player like him. He is
hungry because Iowa was so
close last year. It is players like
him that are going to make it
happen. He is tremendous."

Marble enabled Iowa to
shoot 53.3 percent from the
field and 73 percent (8-for-
11) from behind the arc
thanks to an 8-for-13 shooting
performance from the field in
the first stanza. Meanwhile,
the Wolverines struggled to
match that shooting, going 27
percent from deep as they were
outrebounded 20-11 with Iowa's
Melsahn Basabe and Aaron
White gathering six apiece.
Even after it shut down the
Hawkeyes to begin the second
half, Michigan failed to box out
and mark defenders in the zone.
The Wolverines allowed nine
offensive rebounds as a result,
while collecting just 17 rebounds
- nine fewer than Iowa.
Offensive rebounding may
have helped put the nail in the
Wolverines' coffin, but it was
Iowa's defense that ultimately
overpowered Michigan.
"We feltlike,tobeatMichigan,
you have to play the kind of
defense we played," McCaffery
said. "They have so many
different weapons. You know,
so it was not only getting stops,
but it was getting stops and then
running, and getting offensive
opportunities in transition and
not givingthem seconds."
The Wolverines were unable
to reduce the deficit below 14
in the second half and never
had a chance to replicate
their second-half play against
Michigan State - where it put
together a stretch of small runs
before unleashing a rash of play
to overcome the gap.

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Freshman goaltender Zach Nagelvoort was pulled after surrendering three first-period goals Saturday night.
'M' thrashed by Penn State

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
STATE COLLEGE - On
Saturday night at Pegula Ice
Arena, David's stone hit Goliath
right
between MICHIGAN 0
the eyes. PENN STATE 4
Penn
State, in just its second year as a
Division I program and winless
through nine Big Ten games,
stunned the Michigan hockey
team with three first-period
goals within 10 minutes to cruise
to a 4-0 win.
The loss keeps the 10th-ranked
Wolverines (6-3-1-1 Big Ten, 14-7-
1 overall) behind Wisconsin and
Minnesota in the conference
standings, though Michigan has
two games in hand.
The Nittany Lions fired
pucks at the net early and
never relented. At 5:31 into the
first period, Zach Saar poked
a rebound past freshman
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort.
Six minutes later, forward
David Glen slid the puck by the
netminder from an awkward
angle after Penn State won a
faceoff in the offensive zone.
And before the sellout crowd
had settled from the second goal,
forward Casey Bailey received a
pass in the slot and ripped a shot
that went five hole on Nagelvoort
to find twine.

"Some nights the puck goes
in, some nights it doesn't," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"The puck went in for them, and
it didn't for us."
The Nittany Lions' trifecta
on nine shots prompted
Berenson to pull Nagelvoort
for sophomore goaltender Steve
Racine. In his first action since
Dec. 28 in the Great Lakes
Invitational, Racine stopped 30
of the 31 shots he faced.
"I don't think Zach was
ready for at least two of them,"
Berenson said.
Down by three, Wolverines
delivered a blow of their own
in the second period, though
it came on the ice and not on
the scoreboard. Freshman
defenseman Michael Downing
cleanly leveled Nate Jensen as
he carried the puck up the ice,
which caused a brief stoppage in
play as the Penn State (1-9, 5-18-1)
defenseman made his way slowly
to the bench.
Sophomore forward Boo
Nieves nearly scored the goal
Michigan desperately needed
later in the period, but his
slapshot effort on a rolling puck
rang off the post and rebounded
harmlessly up the ice.
And early into the third period,
freshman forward JT Compher's
wraparound try crossed the goal
line after a scrum in front of the
net, but officials had already

whistled the play dead.
"The longer we went, the
harder it was to score," Berenson
said.
Forward Ricky DeRosa sealed
the game when he added the
Nittany Lions' fourth goal on a
slapshot from the blue line that
Racine never saw.
Minutes before the final
intermission, junior forward
Alex Guptill skated off the
ice gingerly with an apparent
injury when he was sandwiched
between two Penn State players.
He didn't return for the third
period and left the arena after
the game with a large pack of ice
taped around his right shoulder.
Berenson acknowledged that
Guptill suffered an upper-body
injury, but he didn't comment on
the severity.
After PJ Musico and Eamon
McAdam split time in goal for
Penn State in a 7-3 Wolverines
win Friday, Matthew Skoff
earned the start Saturday.
The sophomore stopped all
32 of Michigan's shots on
the night, and stoned senior
forward Derek DeBlois' partial
breakaway with 10 minutes
remaining.
And when the final horn
sounded, the Nittany Lions
poured onto the ice to celebrate
their first Big Ten win of the
season, an unmitigatedthrashing
of the Wolverines.

on Sunday, the Wolverines (6-2

"(Sunday) was a tough

He defeated Iowa's No. 3 Bobby

record to 27-1 this season.
Redshirt junior Steve Dutton
had the Wolverines' only other
win on Sunday, defeating No. 9
Josh Dziewa (3-2) by decision in
the 141-pound class. The result
moved Dutton's record to 5-2 on

"Steve is just finding out how
good of a wrestler he can really

'M' goes 3-1in opening weekend

By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan softball coach Carol
Hutchins's mantra is that her
team plays "one-pitch softball."
It was fitting, then, that in
the final inning of the fifth-
ranked Wolverines' first
contest of the season, junior
pitcher Sara Driesenga stared
down a batter with an 0-2
count, the bases loaded, two
outs and Michigan up 4-0.
The next pitch was sent
soaring into right field. Just like
that, it was 4-3.
But No. 4 Florida (6-0) didn't
stop there, mounting a furious
comeback to force extra innings
and eventually win the game in
the eighth, 9-4.
"We're not where we need to
be at this point," Hutchins said,
"but it's good to get out on the
dirt and see what we've got and
see where we have to go."
Michigan (3-1) looked strong
early in the game, registering
eight hits and taking the 4-0 lead
after a grand slam by sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero.
Driesenga, who pitched
six scoreless innings against
Florida before falling apart in
the seventh, was the Wolverines'
top pitcher last year, but figures
to share that role more this
year with a deep pitching staff.
Driesenga, freshman Megan
Betsa and junior Haylie Wagner
all saw significant time in
the circle this weekend, with
varying results.
Hutchinsshowed she wouldn't
hesitate to use that rotation when
she wasted no time in pulling
Driesenga after she gave up the
three-run shot to the Gators.
"Against Florida, we played
six great innings," Hutchins said.
"But the game is seven innings
long. You have to play all of them
with the same confidence, the
same intensity, and I think we
failed in that category."
Betsa made her collegiate
debut in the seventh with the
Gators' winning run on base. The
freshman struggled to find the
strike zone, hittingthefirstbatter

and walking the bases loaded
before getting pulled herself.
Driesenga re-entered the
game in the seventh and escaped
the jam after allowing one more
run, but Florida's bats came alive
again in the eighth. The Gators'
Taylor Schwartz sent a ball over
the fence on a pitch Driesenga
left hanging on the inside corner
of the plate, forcing Hutchins to
put Wagner in to finish the game.
"We took Sara out because
she wasn't executing," Hutchins
said. "She wasn't throwing with
confidence. We wanted to win
the game."
It was a tough loss to
swallow for Driesenga and
the Wolverines, but the team
responded in impressive fashion.
Just half an hour later, the team
took on No. 25 South Florida
and U.S. National Team pitcher
Sarah Nevins.
In that contest, the Wolverines
played through another tight
game, but this time limited their
mistakes and took advantage of
opportunities on offense.
Betsa immediately got a chance
toredeemherearlierperformance
against the Bulls (1-2). She pitched
a complete game, registered six
strikeouts and allowed just two
earned runs.
After South Florida
intentionally walked Romero in
the sixth, senior first baseman
Caitlin Blanchard stepped up to
send the tying and winning runs
home. Betsa then finished off the
Bulls with six straight outs.
The 3-2 win propelled
Michigan into Sunday's games,
in which the Wolverines heated
up at the plate with 30 hits and 19
runs inwins agast Illinois State
and Bethune-Cookman.
Against the lesser competition
Sunday, the defense was sound.
Wagner recorded 10 strikeouts
and pitched Michigan's second
completegame ofthe tournament
against Illinois State (1-3).
Freshman infielder Abby
Ramirez also continued her
strong opening weekend into
the morning game against the
Redbirds. She went 3-for-4 in
the contest and 7-for-12 on the


weekend. Hutchins said Ramirez
was a spark plug across the board
and probably the top performer
of the weekend.
Sunday's contest against
an overmatched Bethune-
Cookman team was cut short
by the mercy rule in the fifth
inning, as Michigan rolled, 12-1.
Driesenga and Betsa split the
game, and Hutchins said she
still needed to see Betsa give up
fewer free bases. The freshman
walked five batters while
fanning seven.
"That's not the kind of pitching
that we're going to need from
her," Hutchins said. "I think she's
capable of better."
Pitching wasn't the only
position that Hutchins toyed
with over the weekend. The
Wolverines tried to find the
right fit at third base, starting
sophomore Kelsey Susalla
against the Gators but going with
freshman Lindsay Montemarano
after Susalla committed an error
to help fuelFlorida's compeback.
Susalla did start at designated
player against Illinois State
on Sunday and replaced
Montemarano at third against
Bethune-Cookman.
Also of note was sophomore
Sierra Lawrence's absence in
Saturday's games. Lawrence,
who had a productive season at
the plate last year, was expected
to start in left field. Instead she
was a healthy scratch for the first
two games, though she did start
and play well against Bethune-
Cookman. Hutchins didn't
elaborate on why Lawrence didn't
make an appearance Saturday.
The sting of the Florida game
had worn off somewhat by the
end of the tournament, but for the
Wolverines, which will spend the
next five weekends on the road,
the loss was only one game in a
long and harrowing schedule.
"That's the beauty of softball,"
Hutchins said. "The next game
was 30 minutes away, and we get
a minute to basically take it and
put it where it belongs, which is
in the trash. Whether you win
that game or lose that game, that
game's over."

Redshirt freshman Conor
Youtsey got things going for the
Wolverines on Friday with a
win over Tim Lamber (2-0) by

Youtsey's triumph with two more
victories, redshirt freshman

(7-6) and Dutton over Colton
McCrystal (10-3). Both wins were

redshirt junior Jake Salazar's

(7-6) in the 157-pound class.
Michigan then bounced
back with a victory by fifth-
year senior Dan Yates over
Austin Wilson (4-0) in the
165-pound class. Three more
losses followed before Coon's
clinching victory.
The Wolverines split this
weekend placed them fifth in
the Big Ten standings behind
Penn State, Minnesota, Iowa
and Wisconsin, respectively.
Michigan has one more non-
conference dual meet at
Pittsburgh on Feb. 15 before
the Big Ten Championships.
The Wolverines are looking
to improve on their 2012-13
sixth-place finish at the Big Ten
Championships and 33rd out of
72 at the NCAA Championships.
"I think this weekend was
a good learning experience,
especially for our younger guys,"
McFarland said. "Iowa is one
of the toughest places in the
country to wrestle. We're looking
forward to a rematch with them
and with Penn State in the
championships."
The Michigan wrestlers
have certainly had no shortage
of challenges as of late. But
despite losses to Penn State and
Iowa, they have certainly held
their ground.
