DPS modifies trespass order.
against Assistant AG Shirvell

Reports say charge
against Rodriguez
dropped,'U'officials

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Though The Associated Press
is reporting that the NCAA will
releaseitsrulingonits investiga-
tion surrounding the Michigan
football program today, Univer-
sity officials couldn't confirm
that information regarding the
probe will be released today.
Several top University offi-
cials and spokespeople called by
The Michigan Daily last night
said they couldn't comment on
the rumor that the NCAA's rul-
ing would be released publicly
today or that the NCAA will
drop it's charge against Michi-
gan football coach Rich Rodri-
guez.
Rumors emerged when the
AP reported yesterday that "a
person with knowledge of the
NCAA's ruling" said the final
verdict from the NCAA would
be handed down today and that

University officials were "very
happy" with the final outcome.
The source told the AP later
in the day that the NCAA had
dropped its allegation against
Rodriguez.
Athletic Department spokes-
man Dave Ablauf declined to
comment on the reports in an
interview with the Daily last
night.
"We can't comment," Ablauf
said, explaining that the Ath-
letic Department needed to wait
for word from the NCAA before
providing any comment. "We're
on their timetable."
Asked whether anyone at the
University had received notice
of the final ruling, Ablauf said he
couldn't comment on that either.
"I can't comment on any of
that," Ablpuf told the Daily.
"Until the NCAA releases some-
thing, we can't comment on any-
thing."
However, Ablauf said the
University would receive some
sort of prior notice to the final
ruling being released, but that
he wasn't sure how much notice
was customary in the process.

Shirvell allowed
on campus, banned
from events MSA
president attends
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
The University's Department
of Public Safety modified its
trespass order against Andrew

Shirvell, a Michigan assistant
attorney general, yesterday.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said in an interview yes-
terday that effective immediately
modifications had been made to
the trespass warning issued to
Shirvell on Sept.14. And while the
modifications give Shirvell access
to campus in most situations, his
attorney said he's not ruling out
further action against DPS or the
University.
Shirvell is now allowed to be

anywhere on the University's Ann
Arbor campus, though he is pro-
hibited from attending events at
which Michigan Student Assem-
bly President Chris Armstrong
would likely be in attendance and
must leave events if he sees that
Armstrong is present.
"Mr. Shirvell will be granted
access to the U of M campus,
except he is to have no physi-
cal or verbal contact with Chris
Armstrong," Brown said yester-
day morning. "He's also not sup-

posed to be in the same place on
campus where he can reasonably
anticipate that Mr. Armstrong
will be present."
When asked what a reason-
able anticipation of Armstrong's
presence was, Brown explained
one example with regard to Arm-
strong's involvement in MSA.
"I would think a reasonable
person would believe that Chris
probably would be present at MSA
events, so therefore Mr. Shirvell

7-Eleven to open on State St.

Youth turn out in fewer
numbers for midterms

Slurpee spot to
be open 24hours,
include study space
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
Students looking for a Slurpee
fix will soon need not look further
than across the Diag to South State
Street, where a 7-Eleven is slated to
open soon.
By the end of the year, 7-Eleven
Will open its near-campus location
at 318 South State St. - the build-
ing previously occupied by Ritz
Canera.
Soon after Ritz Camera declared

bankruptcy in 2009, its former
property went on the market and
was purchased by local ophthal-
mologist Reza Rahmani, accord-
ing to the building's realtor Jim
Chaconas. Chaconas said the
building was then rented out to
7-Eleven after the company began
to show interest in the location five
months ago.
Chris Benne, a real estate man-
ager for 7-Eleven, said the store is
in the perfect location because it is
across from the Diag and can serve
the needs of a student on the go.
"(The State Street location) is in
the heart of the retail district and
serves the college campus," Benne
said.
Benne added that the 7-Eleven

will be open 24 hours a day all
week in order to accommodate stu-
dents' needs.
"We are there to support the
morning, afternoon and evening
schedules associated with student
life," he said.
Margaret Chabris, the media
director for the company, said the
first floor of the two-story building
will be a traditional 7-Eleven and
sell products like chips, soda and
the company's famous Slurpees.
Chabris added that the second
floor will be a less traditional con-
venience store that will feature a
study space and sell retail items
and coffee.
Chaconas said that because

Tuesday's midterm election
yielded not only a decline in the
number of Democratic seats in
both the United States Senate and

also a decrease in the percentage
of youth votertturnout in compar-

According to statistics released
by the Center for Information

the age of 30 voted on Tuesday,
down from nearly 55 percent in
the presidential election in 2008
and 23 percent in the 2008 presi-

Locally, voters in 14 student-

Fraternity kicked off
campus in 2007
aims to recruit
campus leaders
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Beta Theta Pi fraternity - one of
the first fraternity houses on cam-
pus was removed from campus in

2007 - is making a comeback to the
University and the Interfraternity
Council, after being dormant for
three years, with a new philosophy
and a renovated house.
Fraternity houses stereotypically
invoke images of beer kegs, blast-
ing music, messy houses and over-
all "frat boys" disconnected from
the non-Greek letter community,
but Director of Reestablishment
Phil Fernandez, a Beta alum from
Miami, Ohio said he hopes Beta's
return will help to change this per-

ception.
Last night in the Michigan
League, men interested in the fra-
ternity, sorority members and Beta
advisors gathered to hear a presen-
tation on the fraternity. Members of
the organization will move into the
house this fall.
Fernandez, who was hired by the
Beta Alumni Association, said the
goal of the event was to introduce
the fraternity to the campus com-
munity.

L imiting government

Leaders of the Univer-
sity's chapter of the College
Libertarians say the group
is trying to distinguisb
itself from other poliical
organizations on0 campus by
ltooking beyond party lines
sod instead ftocusintg on the
issues that shape the nation.
"We're not a traditional
political group," said Busi--
ness Schtool junior and exec-
utive board member Sam
van Kleef.
The Libertarian party,
van Kleef said, supports
issues -that minimize gtov-
erment involvement and
maximize individual free-
donm, like those related to
tax reform, health law and
weapons law.
"We believe there should
be linmited government in
both the social and eco-

ntomic aspects of our lives,"
he said.
During meetings, van
Kicef said the grottp usually
discttsses a particular issue,
how parties approach it, and
how it can be improved.
Van Kizef said the group
focused on Proposition 19 -
a failed ballot initiative that
would have legalized and
taxed marijuana in Califor-
nia - which the group sup-
ported.
Vats Kizef said he and
others were "disappointed"
with the ultimate rejection
of the proposition.
"There's really no moral
backing so allow one person
tto tell another person that
they can't smoke nasrijuana
or do other drugs, as long as
they're ntst hartming other
people," he said.

Among the diverse issues
that interest the group, van
Kleef said they tend to shy
away from debating issues
during meetings over which
members of the group would
be completely polarized.
"Overall, we tend to form
a pretty strong, unified
front," he said.
Van Kleef added that he
hopes to see this "utnified
front" continue to grow,
inviting anyone interested
in the ideals of "individual
liberty, freedotm, and per-
sonal responsibility" to join
the Libertarians.
"We really try to push
the ideology that people are
best off when they're free to
do and act as they wish," he
explained. "I think this is a
positive message."

Paul hopes race will
set standards on
religion attacks
A day after a winning a hard-
fought U.S. Senate race, Republi-
can Rand Paul said he was hopeful
a religious attack that backfired
on his opponent will head off sim-
ilar strategies in future political
races.
Nearly four out of five Kentuck-
ians who voted in Tuesday's elec-
tion said they felt Democrat Jack
Conway unfairly attacked Paul by
running a TV ad that asked why
Paul was a member in college of a
secret campus society that mocked
Christians and claimed his god
was "Aqua Buddha," according
to exit polling conducted for The
Associated Press.
Paul denounced the ad as false
and chastised Conway for run-
ning it. The spot triggered a pub-
lic outcry across the state and
nation.
The Paul campaign aired an ad
in response in which he said he
keeps Christ in his heart. And for-
mer Arkansas Gov. Mike Hucka-
bee, a past Republican presidential
candidate and a Baptist minister,
went on Christian radio calling for
Conway to repent.
ALGIERS, Algeria
Minister: Algeria to
arm citizens in fight
* against terrorists
The interior minister has report-
edly said that Algeria will resume a
policy of arming people to reinforce
the fight against terrorism in the
north African country.
Dahou Ould Kablia says the gov-
ernment would honor a request of
some civilians in insecure areas for
weapons "to fight against terror-
ism."
He didn't specify which peo-
ple would be armed and said the
defense ministry was behind the
decision. Algerian media yester-
day published the comments made
Tuesday.

Al-Qaida's offshoot in North
Africa has its roots and has carried
out killings inAlgeria.
The government had a policy
of arming civilians during the
Islamist insurgency that left up to
200,000 people dead in Algeria in
the 1990s. It was later halted under
amnesty deals.

Somalian gov't to
release child soldiers
from country's army
Somalia's government will work
with the United Nations to release
and rehabilitate child soldiers in its
army, a U.N. envoy who tracks the
recruitment of child soldiers said
yesterday.
The number of children in the
Somali army is unclear, but a plan
to be developed, by the Somali gov-
ernment will help establish the
extent of the problem, said Rad-
hika Coomaraswamy, the U.N. spe-
cial representative for children in
armed conflict.
Human rights groups and media
outlets have been reporting about
the existence of child soldiers in
Somalia for years. -One Somali
* human rights group has estimated
that thousands of child soldiers are
used by both the weak, U.N.-backed
government and Islamist militias
like al-Shabab that have been try-
ing to overthrow it for the past
three years.
In June, President Sheik Sharif
Sheik Ahmed ordered an investiga-
tion into the reports.

One suspect from
St. Louis, one from
Minneapolis
ST. LOUIS (AP) - A federal
grand jury has charged three
men, including one from St. Louis
and one from Minneapolis, with
conspiring to funnel money to a
terrorist group in Somalia that the
U.S. says has ties to al-Qaida.
In an indictment returned Oct.
21 and unsealed Wednesday in U.S.
District Court in St. Louis, prosecu-
tors charged St. Louis taxi driver
Mohamud Abdi Yusuf, a Somali
national who immigrated to the
U.S. as a refugee, with one count of
conspiracyto provide material sup-
port to a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion and three counts of providing
material support to a foreign ter-
rorist organization - the radical
Islamistgroup al-Shabab.
The government contends that
Yusuf and Abdi Mahdi Hussein
sent money through a Minneapo-
lis wire-transfer business where
Hussein worked to al-Shabab sup-
porters in Somalia between 2008
and at least July 2009. Hussein,
who is also of Somali descent, is
charged with one count of conspir-

acy to structure monetary transac-
tions. Yusuf also faces that count.
Duane Mohamed Diriye, who
prosecutors contend was on the
receiving end of some transac-
tions, is charged with conspiracy
and terrorist-funding counts and is
believed to be in Somalia or Kenya.
The government says that
Yusuf used aliases to wire the
funds to al-Shabab supporters in
Somalia through Qaran Finan-
cial Express, where authorities
say Hussein worked. It was one of
three Minneapolis money transfer
businesses searched by FBI agents
in April 2009.
Kulane Darman, president of
Qaran Financial Express, told The
Associated Press he doesn't know
Hussein and the information from
the government is incorrect.
"I don't know this person. This
person never worked for me," Dar-
man said.
According to the indictment,
Yusuf, Hussein and other unspeci-
fied alleged schemers tried to mask
thousands of dollars worth of wire
transfers by breaking them up into
small, independent transactions.
They spoke in code and used bogus
names, all to skirt laws govern-
ing wire transactions and to avoid
detection, authorities said.

said Andi Arief, a staffer in the

Indonesia, a vast archipelago
of 235 million people, is prone to
earthquakes and volcanos because
it sits along the Pacific "Ring of
Fire," a horseshoe-shaped string
of faults that lines the Pacific.
As a reminder of that, a
6.0-magnitude quake hit waters
off the eastern province of Papua
on yesterday evening, rattling sev-
eral villages but causing no known
damage or casualties. At the time,
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton was wrapping up
a visit to Papua New Guinea - on
the same island as Papua province.
She was in the capital, about 1,000
miles (1,600 kilometers) east of the
epicenter, and no shaking was felt
there.
The volcano's initial Oct. 26
blast occurred less than 24 hours
after a towering tsunami slammed
into remote islands on the west-
ern end of the country, sweeping
entire villages to sea and killing at
least 428 people.
There, too, thousands of people
were displaced, many living in
government camps.
In both cases, relief operations
are expected to take weeks, pos-
sibly months.
Helicopters and boats were
delivering aid to tsunami survi-
vors in the most distant Mentawai
islands, more than 800 miles
(1,300 kilometers) west of Merapi.

In court, Chavez
supporters back
Basque separatists

Spanish officials
call for man accused
of aiding militants
to be extradited
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - A
Basque separatist fighting extradi-
tion to Spain testified before Ven-
ezuelan prosecutors yesterday, a
Venezuelan activistsaid.
Spanish authorities want to
try Arturo Cubillas, who holds a
government job in Venezuela, on
accusations he helped the Basque
militant group ETA arrange
explosives training with Colom-
bian rebels in Venezuela. Cubillas
insists he is innocent.
Susana Gonzalez, who leads a
Venezuelan group that supports
Basque independence, said she
spoke with Cubillas and he testi-
fied for two hours. Prosecutors
did not immediately comment on
the hearing, and Cubillas did not
appear in public.
Dozens of demonstrators

voiced support for Cubillas out-
side the attorney general's office,
waving Basque flags and chanting:
"No to extradition!"
The protesters includedbackers
of President Hugo Chavez as well
as Cubillas' friends and co-work-
ers. Some wore T-shirts embla-
zoned with images of Argentine
revolutionary icon Ernesto "Che"
Guevara and held signs condemn-
ing Spain's treatment of Basque
separatists.
Augusto Pena, a co-worker
of Cubillas in the government's
National Lands Institute, called
the charges lies and said: "His
crime is working for Chavez's gov-
ernment."
Cubillas testified voluntarily
after asking Venezuelan authorities
last month to investigate, saying he
has not had access to details of the
accusations against him in Spain.
Cubillas told the Caracas-based
television network Telesur in an
interview posted yesterday on its
website that the charges against
him are part of an anti-Chavez
campaign.

Gay rights groups see midterm results as setback

Activists claim
Republican House
majority will have
negative affect
NEW YORK (AP) - Gay-rights
activists celebrated a few bright
spots on Election Day, but they
also suffered some major setbacks
- including losses by key support-
ers in Congress and the ouster of
three Iowa Supreme Court judges
who had ruled in favor of same-sex
marriage.
On both sides of the marriage
debate, the Iowa vote was seen as
a signal that judges in other states
could face similar punitive chal-
lenges.
. The congressional results fur-
ther clouded the prospects for
repealing the "don't ask, don't tell"
policy so that gays could serve
openly in the military. Democratic
leaders, includingPresident Barack
Obama, hope for a repeal vote in the
Senate during the upcoming lame-
duck session, but the post-election
climate may strengthen the hand of
conservatives wary of repeal.
And leading gay activists
acknowledged that the Republican
takeover in the House of Represen-
tatives likely doomed short-term
hopes for major gay-rights legisla-
tion addressing workplace discrim-
ination and federal recognition of
same-sex couples.
"The loss of the House to anti-
equality leaders is a serious blow,"
said Joe Solmonese, president of
the Human Rights Campaign. He
said the incoming GOP House lead-
ership had a track record of oppos-
inggay-rights initiatives.
Among the Democratic losers

on Tuesday were several staunch
gayrights supporters, including
Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin
and Rep. Patrick Murphy of Penn-
sylvania, an Iraq war veteran who
volunteered to be the House leader
of the effort to repeal "don't ask,
don't tell."
Elaine Donnelly of the Center for
Military Readiness, which opposes
any role for gays in the military,
welcomed the defeats of Murphy
and Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., the for-
mer Navy admiral who lost his bid
for a Senate seat.
"Both candidates tried to dis-
guise their extreme social liberal-
ism with military uniforms they
had previously worn," said Don-
nelly, who noted that Republican
Sen. John McCain - a key to block-
ing repeal of "don't ask, don't tell"
- was re-elected in Arizona.
Perhaps most sobering for gay
activists was the removal of the
three Iowa judges after a campaign
intended to punish them for joining
a unanimous ruling last year that
the state's ban on same-sex mar-
riage violated Iowa's constitution.
That ruling, making Iowa one of
five states to legalize gay marriage,
still stands. But gay marriage foes
said they plan to press Iowa Repub-
licans who took over the governor's
office and the state House to work
toward a new ban.
Justices Marsha Ternus, David
Baker and Michael Streit will be
removed at year's end after about
54 percent of voters backed their
ouster - the first time Iowa voters
have removed a Supreme Courtjus-
tice since the current system began
in 1962.
The National Organization for
Marriage and other foes ofgaymar-
riage around the country spent an
estimated $1 million on the removal

Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), a staunch gay-rights supporter, concedes in the race for his Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat.

effort, while the three judges chose
not to raise money and campaign.
"This spiteful campaign is a
wake-up call to future voters who
must resist attempts to politicize
the courts," said Kevin Cathcart
of Lambda Legal, a national gay-
rights group. "If an embattled
judiciary were to lose its ability to
protect our laws and constitution
with impartiality, that would be a
tragic loss."
Brian Brown, president of the
National Organization for Mar-
riage, depicted the judges' ouster,
coupled with the GOP gains in Con-
gress, as a "historic and stunning"
victory for foes of gay marriage.
The Iowa result, he said, "sends
a powerful message to any judge
who thinks they can impose gay

marriage by judicial fiat against the
wishes of the people."
Evan Wolfson, a gay-rights law-
yer who heads the national group
Freedom to Marry, said the judicial
recall was intended as "an intimi-
dating, thuggish message" to other
courts.
"If I had just mugged a judge, I
wouldn't be running around brag-
ging about it," he said.
The results set the stage for sev-
eral likely state battles over same-
sex marriage next year.
Gay-rights groups said the elec-
tion of governors in Rhode Island
and Maryland who support same-
sex marriage created a chance for
breakthroughs in those states. In
New York, where a gay marriage
bill was defeated in 2009, the pic-

ture was clouded by uncertainty
over control of the state Senate,
but Democratic Gov.-elect Andrew
Cuomo is a firm supporter of gay
marriage.
Foes of gay marriage said
Republican legislative gains could
benefit their cause in Minnesota,
where conservatives would like to
put a gay-marriage ban on the bal-
lot, and in New Hampshire, where
some lawmakers would like to
repeal the 2009 law legalizing gay
marriage.
"The backers of gay marriage are
fond of telling the lie that gay mar-
riage is inevitable in this country,"
Brown said. "What we have shown
in this election is that support for
gay marriage is a career-ending
position for judges and legislators."

Bringing home the batteries
Snyder should travel overseas to attract investors
ollowing the landslide election of Republican Rick Snyder
as Michigan's new governor on Tuesday, it seems that few
people will be sad to see Gov. Jennifer Granholm leave
office. Granholm's governorship was plagued with economic
downturn and drastic budget cuts. But the current governor has
started a few projects that the governor-elect should continue.
Yesterday, Granholm left Michigan for Seoul, South Korea as
part of an investment mission to bring foreign chemical and bat-
tery companies to Michigan. Snyder should pursue international
investment opportunities similar to Granholm's while also seek-
ing out other, diverse types of business.

...got their ass handed to them.

How to be ironic

Granholm left for South Korea yesterday
for three days to promote international
investments in Michigan. According to a
Nov. 1 press release from the governor's
office, Granholm will meet with three dif-
ferent companies involved in the manu-
facturing of technologically advanced
batteries. Granholm said in a statement
that bringing these industries to the state
will help to establish Michigan as a new
center for battery and electric powered
vehicles. Since 2004, Granholm has made
a total of 12 trips abroad in an attempt to
bring more overseas investments to the
state. According to the governor's office,
these trips have collectively brought near-
ly $2 billion into the state.
Michigan has infrastructure and
resources left over from the peak of the
automotive industry that currently aren't
being utilized. There are empty plants sur-
rounding the Detroit area, for example,
that could easily be retrofitted to manufac-
ture electric vehicles, advanced batteries,
solar panels and wind turbines. And if new
businesses settle down in Michigan, these
ready-made factories can be staffed with
already-trained manufacturing workers,
creating jobs the state desperately needs.
We've seen it happen: according to the gov-
ernor's office, Granholm's mission to draw
investors to the state has already created
or retained nearly 20,000 jobs. And one of
the companies that Granholm intends to
meet with in Seoul is expected to employ

400 workers at a Holland lithium-ion bat-
tery plant by 2012.
These technologically-advanced and
environmentally friendly lithium-ion bat-
teries will also help to encourage Michi-
gan's automotive industry to shift its focus
to producing more vehicles that run on
alternative energy. With the components
needed for these vehicles easily acces-
sible and therefore less expensive, Mich-
igan-based automotive companies have a
financial incentive to move forward with
manufacturing greener vehicles.
While manufacturing can't be the sole
source of economic prosperity in Michi-
gan as it has been in the past, it's an inte-
gral part of creating a diverse economy.
Governor-elect Rick Snyder has extensive
experience as a businessman and inves-
tor. This experience should be valuable as
Snyder takes on the challenge of reviving
Michigan's economy. When Snyder takes
office, he should utilize his business expe-
rience and follow Granholm's example to
continue attracting international compa-
nies to Michigan.
Granholm has made an effort to seek
out successful companies and encouraged
them to bring their ideas to the Midwest.
Her work has started to lay the ground-
work for an innovative, diverse economy.
But the job will not be complete by Janu-
ary, when Granholm leaves office. Snyder
needs to make ita priority to draw interna-
tional investors to Michigan.

ut of all the questions I receive
from readers, the most com-
mon one is, "Can you please
stop writing col-
umns?" These read-
ers, of course, are
being ironic.
It's perhaps the
best word that
sums up our gen-
eration, other than
"disappointing."
But what exactly
is irony? And how WILL
does one go about
being ironic? These GRUNDLER
can be difficult
questions for many
students, despite the prevalence of
irony in modern-day art, media, litera-
ture and liberals.
Understanding irony is essential to
making friends, dominating conver-
sations, being elitist, wooing poten-
tial mates, insulting people, watching
reality TV and a whole lot of other
activities that we students practice. It
has revolutionized the field of sociol-
ogy and probably lots of other fields,
too. In short, as the saying goes, if you
don't know irony then you don't know
a zebra from a horse that has stripes
spray-painted on it.
The good news is that irony is not
too difficult to learn. One of the key
skills is saying one thing and mean-
ing another. This is termed verbal
irony and it's practically indispensi-
ble when it comes to being funny and
interesting.
For instance, imagine you've just
finished a romantic candlelit dinner
and your date says, "I had a wonder-
ful time." Should you simply say, "Me
too"? If you wish tobe unremarkable
and boring, go ahead. But a better idea
would be to say, "Me too, and you look
really beautiful in low lighting such
as that provided by these candles."
You're saying your date is beautiful
but you actually mean your date is
ugly, which is flirty and fun, because

you don't really mean that. Otherwise
you wouldn't be dating, obviously.
You're being ironic. Get it?
Another form of irony is situational
irony, which occurs when there is a dis-
parity between what is expected and
what actually happens. A famous case
of situational irony occurred in the
American Civil War, when Union Army
general John Sedgwick chastised his
troops for flinching during a shootout.
"They couldn't hit an elephant at this
distance!" he declared. Well, you know
what happened next: the damn Con-
federates somehow managed to shoot
the Union elephant, even though it was
hidingbehind atree.
No, I'm sorry. They actually shot
Sedgwick below the eye and killed
him. This was quite unexpected and
ironic, and the Union soldiers all had
a good laugh. Now, obviously you can't
do situational ironylikeyou canverbal
irony, but you can recognize it. The
trick is always pointing it out when it
occurs, which makes you seem awful-
ly intelligent. For example, if you are
taking a class on religion and the
topic of sexual abuse by religious offi-
cials comes up in discussion, you can
chuckle and say, "Oh, the irony! Situ-
ational, of course. Who would have
thought?" Many of your fellow stu-
dents, not to mention your GSI, will be
impressed with your knowledge of the
specific type of irony.
Perhaps the most amusing form
of irony you can try is feigned igno-
rance, or Socratic irony. Thousands of
years ago, the philosopher Socrates
would pretend to be stupid during
discussions to draw out the illogic in
his opponent's argument. Tragically,
as you will remember, he eventually
went too far and ate poison hemlock
on purpose to prove god-knows-
what, but his contributions to irony
are still revered today. Basically,
you act rather dumb to tease, amuse,
anger or expose the prejudices of a
fellow human being before getting
punched in the mouth.

Here is a hypothetical conversa-
tion between two students, with Ned
employing Socratic irony:
Ethel: "Republicans are taking
over the House, Ned!"
Ned: "What? When? Do we have
enough food?"
Ethel: "The House of Representa-
tives, Ned."
Ned: "Oh! With guns?"
Ethel: "I hate you, Ned."
(Note how Ned makes Ethel express
her deep-seated, irrational hatred.)
The word that
sums up our
generation.
Oh no; I'm almost out of room and
I've completely forgotten about post-
modernism. okay, real quick: irony and
postmodernism go hand in hand and
it's important to use the term "post-
modern" in as many conversations as
you can, usually with the structure,
"In our postmodern society, however, I
think the concept of X is Y, don't you?"
Y is almost always something negative.
For instance, if someone were to ask
you about art, you would say, "I think
in our postmodern society, the concept
of artis rather artificial, don't you?"
Anyway, I hope this article cleared
up most people's questions about
irony. At this point in our country's
history, we all need a solid grasp of
it, and while there are those who say
that irony is, in essence, cynical, pro-
found negativity that rejects objec-
tive morality and causes the death
of sincerity, remember that they are
probably justbeingironic.

Salvation through equations

It is well established that delinquent behav-
ior is a precipitant of several social and cogni-
tive factors. Instead of facing this fact, the U.S.
Congress continues to support punishment-
driven law enforcement policy in order to
appear "tough on crime." In keeping criminals
off the streets, citizens are given the impres-
sion of reduced crime while our country now
has the highest average incarceration rate in
the world.
You may ask: Who are these offenders? The
answer is that they are primarily the most vul-
nerable of our population - kids in their late
teens and early 20s. Studies have shown that
these young adults generally lack strong sup-
port from conventional adult institutions, like
family or work. Further enveloped by poverty,
racial disparity and our present culture of
punishment, these children find themselves in
what the Children's Defense Fund describes as
a "cradle-to-prison pipeline." No matter how
much we franchise the harsh prosecution of
crime, unless we address the underlying root
cause of criminal activity, we are letting the
actual crime go unpunished.
In Richmond, Virginia, the pilot program
Gang Reduction and Intervention spent $2.5
million in a collaborative effort with the fed-
eral, state and local partners to focus on a
target community. In two years, the city saw
major crimes in that community decline by
43 percent. Homicides fell from 19 to 2. This
program is an example of an evidence-based
strategy. That is, a program that has been
experimentally proven to reduce crime rates in
youth. Though the Richmond example speaks
for itself, it's worth reiterating how prevention
programs can dramatically change the course
of this cradle-to-prison paradigm.
This is what a bipartisan bill called Youth
PROMISE (Prison Reduction through Oppor-
tunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support,
and Education) Act (H.R. 1064/S. 435), intends
to do. The Youth PROMISE Act would provide
support for youth organizations to create a

PROMISE advisory panel. This panel would
highlight specific areas of need for prevention
programs and work with vital support systems
within communities, including parents, com-
munity members, faith-based organizations
and law enforcement. Together, these groups
will evaluate the needs of a specific commu-
nity and implement evidence-based prevention
and intervention strategies, like early child-
hood education, mentoring, mental health and
job training. The bill provides accountability
for these programs through regular reports
to federal and local government and frequent
reviews of current research on societal needs
and youth crime statistics.
The bill is presently in the U.S. House of
Representatives and has come under attack
because it expands federal oversight of state
criminal policy and increases the national
deficit. Though the bill requires $1.6 billion
in funding, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), who
authored the bill, suggests that the cost pales
in comparison to how much is already spent on
punishing young criminals.
In Los Angeles County, it costs $140,000
a year to keep a minor in juvenile hall. The
numbers are equally daunting for Michigan.
In 2009, Michigan spent $34,000 per inmate
while the national average was a little less
than $29,000 per inmate. And while Michigan
residents pay for an incarceration rate that is 5
percent greater than the national average, our
crime rates remain unchanged. It's because
of these policies that we're made to lock our
children in prison for the most formative years
of their lives. Michigan deserves law enforce-
ment policies that work.
Let's create policies that take our kids out of
prisons and put them into schools and the job
market. Let us target the root cause of crime,
instead of placing it out of sight. Please contact
your representatives in Congress to ensure the
protection of our youth and communities.

truggling to understand the
mechanics of an equation,
how it works and when to use
it, is nothing new
to University stu-
dents - particu-
larly engineering
students. Quite
often I've found
myself study-
ing late into the
night, groggily
sorting out Greek
letters,. integrals JOE
and derivatives,
because - as most SUGIYAMA
engineers know
- the best way to
master these con-
cepts is practice, practice, practice.
In spite of the dread soa often
associated with applying equations,
I've come to terms with the fact that
they're needed to describe the natu-
ral and man-made world. Without
Newton's laws or Einstein's famous
energy equation, the science commu-
nity and society as a whole would be
up a creek without a paddle. Though
Newton lived nearly 280 years ago,
his equations are still a critical part
of how we describe our world and
a new breakthrough by University
researchers may have the same last-
ing effect.
Recently, University Professor of
Electrical Engineering Steve Forest
and his team of researchers devel-
oped an equation capable of describ-
ing the electrical current and voltage
properties of organic semiconduc-
tors. This would allow organic mate-
rials to potentially be used for solar
cells and high-efficiency lighting.
According to an Oct. 20 University
of Michigan News Service article,
Forest said that "the field of organic
semiconductor research is still in its
infancy" and it's not possible to make

"complicated circuits with them yet."
But this newborn equation has the
potential to reshape our world in the
same way that Newton did.
What makes this equation so
exciting is that it allows scientists to
understand "the relationship of cur-
rent to voltage at junctions of organic
semiconductors." Organic - mean-
ing carbon-based - semiconductors
are typically large and complex in
their chemical make-up. This poses
some serious problems for research-
ers trying to use organic polymers in
applications that require knowledge
of how electrical current flows in the
material. Being able to describe the
electrical properties of an organic
semiconductor makes it possible for
researchers to explore how carbon-
based materials could be used in a
variety of applications - most nota-
bly, solar panels.
Oneofthemaindrawbacksoftoday's
solar panels is that the polymers used
have a relatively low efficiency rating
of about 13 percent. This means that
of all the solar energy hitting the area
of the panel, only about 13 percent can
be transformed into usable electricity.
Forest's equation opens up the field of
organic materials for researchers to
boost the power output and efficiency
ratings of solar panels.
This higher efficiency rating
would make solar panels a more
attractive alternative energy option
for both commercial and personal
use. If these new organic polymers
could raise the total energy output of
a solar panel by just a few percent, the
fiscal incentives of installing these
panels become more and more entic-
ing. Currently, DTE - the energy
company that supplies power to many
people in the state - has a program
where they help to install solar pan-
els onto homes. The energy gener-
ated by the panels is then fed directly

into the electrical grid - essentially
"charging" the grid.
The electrical bill for a home with
these solar panels reflects the differ-
ence between the power the home uses
and the power its solar panels gener-
ate, which greatly reduces overall cost.
The idea of making homes and busi-
nesses energy self-sufficient is exciting
for homeowners and environmentalist
alike. It could even result in a refund
check from DTE - that is, if the power
generatedby the home is more than the
amount of power used.
New math is
solving the
energy crisis.
Right now, we're using fossil fuels
at an unsustainable rate and we're at
risk of running out sometime in the
next 200 years. The University has
often found itself seeking an answer
to this global problem through both
education and research. The Univer-
sity's effort to raise awareness of the
problems and solutions of the energy
crisis we are currently facing, as well
as the advancements of University
researchers, is deserving of praise.
We have come to realize that the
key to energy of the future is green.
The development of Forest's equation
is one of the many ways the Univer-
sity is attacking this issue head on. If
we're able to lead the charge in devel-
oping energy efficient solar panels,
then University researchers, students
and the state as a whole will benefit.

AAPD: Assaults
Michigan State
weekend were
not connected

Students Against Surveillance meet in the Michigan Union last night to discuss a proposaI that woud prohibit the use of surveillance cameras in Ann Arbor.
Campus group aims to block cameras
for su-rveill*1ance fro-m coming! to city

After cameras put
up in Lansing, group
wants City Council
to pass measure
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
in a dimly lit and nearly empty
room in the Union, William Leaf,
founder of Students Against
Surveillance, asked the photog-
rapher in the room to obtain per-
mission from the other members
of the group before capturing the
meeting.
"This is a privacy club," he
said.
The meeting last night was
called, Leaf said, because of the
recent installment of police sur-
veillance cameras in the Lansing
area.
"There is this idea that there
is no privacy in public. But we
need privacy in public in order
to be free people," Leaf said after
closing the wooden doors to the
Sophia B. Jones Room.
SAS isa new student organiza-
tion that recently announced its
plans to thwart the installation
of surveillance cameras in Ann
Arbor by encouraging the Ann
Arbor City Council to pass The
Ann Arbor Freedom from Sur-
veillance ordinance - a measure
to prevent monitoring of public
areas in the city.
The text of the ordinance
states that cameras need to be
banned in outdoor parks and
residential neighborhoods but
may be permitted on Ann Arbor

ing wrongdoing by the Michi-
gan football program prompted
University officials to launch an
internal investigation into sev-
eral issues within the program.
The NCAA also began inves-
tigating the football program in
October 2009, leading to a notice
of allegations that was publicly
released in February.
At the time, the NCAA alleged
five violations: that the football
program exceeded the number
of coaches allowed to work with
student-athletes and the number
of hours student-athletes prac-
ticed, that Athletic Department

shouldn't be there," she said. "And
if Shirvell finds himself in a place
where he sees Chris is present,
he's instructed he needs to leave."
However, Brown said there
is an exception to the rule, say-
ing that Shirvell and Armstrong
could be at the same event in cer-
tain situations.
"It doesn't include intercolle-
giate events, meaning they could
both potentially be at a football
game," Brown said.
Brown said Shirvell's modi-
fied trespass order carries a new
clause that DPS routinely adds
to modified trespass orders. The
clause stipulates that Shirvell
must "comply with all laws, rules

blocks with unusually high crime
rates. The ordinance also states
that the footage should not be
held by the state for more than
two weeks if there is no inves-
tigation involved and that live
monitoring would be banned.
According to Leaf, an ordi-
nance of this kind has never been
implemented previously in the
city.
Currently, camera technology
has been installed in residential
neighborhoods around Lansing,
allowing the city's police depart-
ment to view the 13 cameras put
in place. There are no known
plans for the installment of sur-
veillance cameras in Ann Arbor.
Leaf said he and other mem-
bers of SAS believe that the cam-
eras are useless and have not
proven to be effective in limit-
ing the incidence of crime, citing
the minimal impact of increased
surveillance measures in Great
Britain.
Leaf added that the ordinancee
would not ban the use of surveil-
lance cameras in Ann Arbor, but
rather restrict it.
"The academic evidence is on
our side. We are actually giv-
ing up our freedom for nothing."
Leaf said. "It's putting the bur-
den of proof on the police depart-
ment."
Leaf said if Ann Arbor is a
model for medium-sized cities,
the ordinance could have nation-
al significance.
According to Leaf, police offi-
cials in Ann Arbor are not con-
cerned with the problem. Leaf
said that a preventative ordi-
nance would be more effective
if any surveillance proposals are
staff monitored student-athletes
in voluntary workouts against
NCAA rules, that Michigan
football coach Rich Rodriguez
"failed to promote an atmosphere
of compliance," that the Athletic
Department did not properly
oversee the activities of the foot-
ball program, and that a graduate
assistant football coach attempt-
ed to mislead the NCAA during
their investigation by providing
false information about his role
in the matters.
The University admitted to
every allegation concerning the
program as a whole in May when
it sent its response to the NCAA.
But Rodriguez disputed the alle-
gation that he failed to promote
an atmosphere of compliance
Philip Thomas, Shirvell's attor-
ney, said he hasn't consulted his
client yet, but that he has mixed
feelings about the modification to
the trespass order.
"In general that portion of the
decision that allows him 100-per
cent full rights to go back on cam-
pus and sporting events, that is
gratifying. It was fair," Thomas
said. "However, what I don't
understand, and I'm not sure
there is authority for, is a provi-
sion in the letter that made refer-
ence to the fact that if (Shirvell)
came into some type of contact
with Mr. Armstrong he would be
obligated to leave."
Thomas added, "I'm not cer-
tain there is authority for that
in the rules and regulations con-
cerning the Department of Public
Safety and I'm aso not certain
that would even be Constitution-

al." w
But what steps Thomas will

presented to City Council in the
future.
"Governments have abused
their power very horribly in the
past, and if they have the poseer
to see where everyone is all the
time, the abuse of power would
be much worse with mass sur-
veillance," he said. "It's a nasty
feeling, and it's not one we should
tolerate in Ann Arbor."
The main challenge to SAS,
Leaf said, is to get the issue of the
breach of privacy into the minds
of students on campus and resi-
dents of Ann Arbor.
Video surveillance in stores
and other businesses would
remain unaffected with the pas-
sage of the ordinance.
A main tenet to SAS's strat-
egy, Leaf said, is to expand the
network so that the organization
can persuade an influential spon-
sor to propose the ordinance to
City Council.
Leaf said he hopes the Michi-
gan Student Assembly will pass
a resolution for the restriction
of camera surveillance during
its meeting on Tuesday, adding
that if the resolution were passed
through MSA, more manpower
would be generated. College Lib-
ertarians is also in support of the
ordinance, according to Leaf.
"The lawyers we talked to said
the ordinance text is good to go,"
Leaf said.
But Diane Brown, spokes-
woman for the Department of
Public Safety, said she's "kind of
confused" by the group's efforts,
adding that she doesn't think
SAS is aware of the number of
cameras already in place in Ann
Arbor.
and did not monitor the activities
of his program sufficiently.
Asked by the Daily in an inter-
view in September whether that
change was more difficult to
swallow because his name was
attached to it, Rodriguez said it
waS.
"Sure," Rodriguez said. "I
think anytime you have your
name on anything like that it's
just something that you ... have
a hard time dealing with, so
that's one reason why we made
our case, but we'll see what hap-
pens."
As part of their response,
University officials announced
several corrective measures
being taken internally and a
set of self-imposed penalties,
take next on Shirvell's behalf
remain unclear. As Thomas
said yesterday, he hadn't had an
opportunity to discuss the modi-
fication with his clent.
"I have not had an opportunity
to speak about it with my client
yet, so where we're going to go
from here I don't know," Thomas
said.
However, Thomas said he
wouldn't rule out further action,
which could include an appeal or
litigation against DS.
"At this juncture I would not
be in a posture where I could
rule out sonme type of further
action regarding that provision,"
Thomas said. "We have the right
of course to go to court and then
in addition to that in the Univer-
sity rules and regulations there
is actually a provision for seek-
ing some sort of limited review

regarding the Department of
Public Safety's decision."

"It makes it seem like folks
don't necessarily recognize that
there are a lot of cameras that
capture what's going on with
people on a regular basis," Brown
said.
Brown added that the Uni-
versity does not plan to install
cameras in places other than
buildings or residence halls.
Michael Kaufman, a senior in
the School of Music and mem-
bers of SAS, said the campus and
the city are downplaying the pri-
vacy concerns.
"This (privacy issue) leads to
consolidation of power instead
of decentralization. This is some-
thing that is fundamental to all
of our identities," Kaufman said.
"We have become more numb to
these privacy issues with social
networking."
Public Policy junior Bennett
Stein, a member of the group,
said despite the openness of the
Internet, the issue of privacy
transcends generations.
"We keep being told that we
are a generation that doesn't
want to have privacy and that
we are a society that doesn't
care about privacy," Smitt said.
"Facebook and other technology
have blurred those lines a bit, but
when it comes down to it, people
do value their privacy."
LSA senior Joe Klaver said
he's pushing for the measure
because he believes that "just
because there isn't a problem
doesn't mean there won't be a
problem."
"Once you spend the money to
get them up it's going to be hard
to get the money getting them
down," he said.
which included cuts to the num-
ber of hours student-athletes in
the football program would be
required to practice over the
next two years - the minimum
probation period allowed by
the NCAA - and a 40-percent
reduction in the number of qual-
ity control staff.
University officials pled their
case during two days of closed-
door hearings in front of the
NCAA Committee on Infractions
in Seattle, Wash. in August.
Many University officials
have said they are ready to move
beyond the alleged rules viola-
tions, including Athletic Direc-
tor David Brandon who said he
was "eager" to move forward in
May.
Shirvell's initial ban from cam-
pus came amid a controversy sur-
rounding Shirvell's blog, "Chris
Armstrong Watch," and several
appearances Shirvell made at
campus events that Armstrong
attended, including an MSA
meeting where Shirvell called
on Armstrong to resign as MSA
president.
Armstrong had sought a per-
sonal protection order against
Shirvell last month but dropped
his petition on Oct. 28, after attor-
neys for Armstrong and Shirvell
reportedly reached a resolution
outside of court.
Armstrong has since retained
Attorney Deborah Gordon and
the two have filed complaints
with the Michigan Attorney
Grievance Commission, seeking
an investigation into Shirvell's
actions and necessary disciplin-

ary actions, up to and including
disbarment.

By LILLIAN XIAO
Daily StaffReporter
An Ann Arbor police official
said in an interview yesterday that
authorities believe that two assaults
that took place during the weekend
of Oct. 15 are not related.
The first case occurred shortly
after midnight on Oct. 15 when an
18-year-old University student was
struck on the head with aglassobottle
at Fifth Quarter, causing significant
injury to his right eye and severe lac-
erations to his mouth, AAPD Detec-
tive David Monroe said. He added
that the suspect was described as a
college-aged white male with light
brown hair that is slightly longer or
curly in the back. Police officials at
first suspected that a particular fra-
ternity was involved in the assault,
but after a period of investigation,
police have not gained any addition-
al information fromtheearlierleads,
Monroe said.
"We had some initial information
thatmaybefraternitymemberswere
involved, but at this point, we're not
certain about it at all," Monroe said.
"It came to a point where wait a see-

who are often attendinguniversities
or beginning careers in new loca-
tions.
"A lot of midterm elections focus
on local issues and young people
are often in a transitional stage in
their life," Traugott said. "So their
involvement and engagement with
local issues is less and therefore they
don't see or attach as much signifi-
cance to participation in these local
elections as they do in a presidential
campaign."
Traugott also called voting "an
acquired habit" and said many
young people are still developing
political activism skills and learn-
ingthe importance of voting in local
and national elections. He said that
decline in youth voting paired with
large numbers of older voters who
supported Republican candidates
due to troubles in the economy, led
to the shift in power seen in this
election.
"It's not surprising to see the
incumbent party lose seats in the
midterm election, especially with
the economy when the conditions
are bad," Traugott said. "The Dem-
ocrats have had unusually large
majorities, so I think it was rea-
sonable to expect they would take
unusually large losses."
Political Science Prof. Vincent
Hutchings echoed Traugott's sen-
timent, saying that because the
economy has been such a prominent
issue in the political conversation
both locally and nationally since
President Barack Obama took office
in 2008, voters were hoping that a
change in party power may lead to
increased solutions.
"Clearly, the mostsalentissue for
most voters - and one doesn't need
the exit polls to see this - would be
the economy," Hutchings said. "I
think the concern with the econo-
my didn't work to the Democrats'
advantage, because they're the party
in power and there's a widespread
perceptionthat the economy's doing
very poorly. That's never going to
work for the incumbent party. "
Hutchings said that a growth in
Republican seats in the Senate and
the House doesn't necessarily mean
that Obama will struggle with main-

taining his presidency in the 2012
election.
He added that Obama's presi-
dency may mirror Ronald Reagan's
in the fact that Reagan faced simi-
lar economic difficulties during his
time in office, but because of eventu-
al economic growth throughout his
term in office, he was able to salvage
his presidency after the Republi-
cans lost many seats in the midterm
results of 1982.
"(Reagan) went on to win in 1984
because the economy had turned
around," Hutchings said. "If that
were to happen, the incumbent
president in this case - Barack
Obama -would have a pretty good
chance of winning actually."
Brendan Campbell, chair of the
University's chapter of College
Democrats, said he was disappoint-
ed that the student voting percent-
age was so low and attributed the
loss of Democratic seats, at least in
part, to the decline in youth voting.
"Ithink it'spretty clear that when
students come out to vote, we elect
people who put policies in place
that exist for students and we elect
Democrats," Campbell said. "When
we don't come out and vote, when

ond, this could be anyone who was at
the bar that night."
Detective Monroe described a
second assault at about 10 p.m. on
Oct.16, following the Michigan foot-
ball team's loss to Michigan State.
The 22-year-old victim, a Washt-
enaw Community College student,
suffered significant injuries to his
teeth and face when struck and
kicked by his attacker. The victim
reported that the attacker said "Go
State" and the victim responded
with "Go Blue," Monroe said. Mon-
roe said the stranger countered with
"F***you" and the victim responded
with the same expletive.
Monroe said the suspect was
described as 5'8" to 6' with a bald
or shaved head, muscular build and
was either a white male with darker
complexion or a black male with
lighter complexion. The attacker's
girlfriend, a white female with curly
black hair, threatened to call the
police, Monroe said. He added that
the police received five different
calls about the incident from nearby
witnesses.
The AAPD has yet to release the
names of any victims.
we stay at home on Election Day, we
end up electing people who really
plan on cutting education funding."
Campbell said that instead of
focusing on the implications of
Tuesday's election may have on
Obama's presidency and the 2012
election, Democrats across the
nation are looking to unite and con-
tinue moving onward.
"I know Democrats right now
aren't focused about what's going
to happen in 2012. Right now,
we're just looking towards working
together and making sure that we
continue to work to move this coun-
try forward," he said.
Charles Bogren, chair of the Uni-
versity's chapter of College Republi-
cans, said he too was disappointed
with the low voter turnout among
young people. Bogren said he thinks
political "apathy" is why students
failed to turn out at the polls.
However, Bogren disagreed
with Campbell by saying the shift
towards electing more Republicans
was due to Democrats, who voted
for Obama in 2008, crossing over
and voting Republican in Tuesdays
election.
"I think a lot of the people who
increased voter turnout in 2008
are people who went out and voted
for Obama and then became disen-
franchised with the whole admin-
istration in the past two years and
decided tojustsit on their hands and
notgo out and vote," Bogren said.
Yonah Lieberman, a member of
Voice Your Vote - the nonpartisan
Michigan Student Assembly organi-
zation that strives to improve elec-
tion participation - said he thinks
students often don't turn out to the
polls because they dont believe they
play an important role in the politi-
cal process.
"i think students don't really
understand the privilege of the vote
because they think they have more
important things to do," Lieberman
said. "And goingtoclass is important
and doing your work is important,
but the voting takes 15 minutes."
Lieberman said he thinks tests
and exams given by professors on
Election Day keep students from
going to the polls, and is something
that should be banned so that stu-
dents have more time to focus on
election related issues.
"An election is more important

than a test," Lieberman said.
LSA sophomore Erin Breed said
she thinks students don't vote in
midterm elections because they
don't realize how policies decided in
local elections affect them.
"People don't realize that the elec-
tions actually affect them and the
people around them," Breed said.
"They think that our rights and laws
were magically put in place, they
don't have anything to do about it."
LSA freshman Caitlin Morath
said she tried to register to vote
based on her permanent address,
but her application wasn't approved
in time to vote on Tuesday. Despite
this, Morath said even if she could
vote, she didn't feel knowledgeable
enough about the candidates or
know what Ann Arbor needs most
since she's new to the area.
"For me I feel like during the
midterm, I don't know what's best
for Michigan at this point," Moreth
said. "I don't know how long I will
stay here and what this will mean
for my future."

BETA
From Page 1A
Though the fraternity is just
getting back to campus this year,
Beta began a self-improvement
campaign about 14 years ago,
when the national fraternity "took
a real honest look in the mirror
and it didn't like a lot of the things
that it saw," Fernandez said.
Many of its chapters had seri-
ous risk management problems,
low academics and dwindling
alumni involvement. To combat
these issues, national Beta lead-
ers created the "Men of Principle
Initiative," which started as an
option for chapters but is now a
mandatory program for all the
fraternity's chapters.
"(The initiative) wasn't neces-
sarily something new," Fernan-
dez said. "It was just the same
things that we are supposed to be
about, but it was repackaged and
rebranded."
The national Beta organization
closed the University's chapter of
the fraternity three years ago, not
for any specific reason they say,
but because of a series of actions
that "didn't meet" or "align" with
the national organization's stan-
dards, Fernandez said.
"The guys weren't bad guys.
They were smart; they got good
grades," he said. "There were just
some things that the (chapter's)
culture holistically wasn't meet-

ing with some of our expecta-
tions."
Fernandez said the chapter had
repeated risk violations and failed
to comply with sanctions from
those violations.
Fernandez said the national
Beta organization wanted to
return to the University because it
is home to "high caliber students."
In addition, Fernandez said the
fraternity has an extensive his-
tory on campus.
The chapter is recruiting new
members using both conventional
and unconventional methods, Fer-
nandez said.
LSA senior Brett Vasicek, vice
president of internal recruit-
ment for IFC, said he was "very
impressed" with Beta's presenta-
tion last night, adding that he sees
the fraternity becoming a very
strong chapter.
Instead of having a traditional
recruitment process, the fraterni-
ty is using an application process,
whereby the fraternity contacts
specific students and asks them if
they are interested in joining. The
chosen students are then given
an application form and awarded
bids on a rolling basis.
So far 25 men have been given
applications and 10 have been
returned. Fernandez said officials
are planning to hand out the bids
by the end of this week and over
the weekend. Fernandez added
that the fraternity is in contact
with about 150 men and is con-

tinuing to contact more.
LSA senior Joseph Eisman,
who was at the meeting last night,
said he's involved in three student
organizations and co-chairs two
of them, but that he's still inter-
ested in joining the fraternity.
Eisman said one of the hard-
est parts of being a senior is find-
ing an organization that utilizes a
senior's unique role. He said Beta
provides this opportunity by
allowing him the chance mentor
younger men.
LSA sophomore Hari Vutukuru,
another interested potential new
member of Beta who is involved
in four student organizations, said
the chance of a fresh start that the
fraternity offers is what drew him
to Beta.
"Having an opportunity to
leave a mark or a legacy on cam-
pus as well as distinguish our-
selves from other fraternities on
campus is what drew me," he said.
"I'm interested in being a part
of enhancing the Greek experi-
ence and shatter the stereotype of
Greek life."
Vasicek said once IFC's official
recruitment period ended, Fer-
nandez began actively recruit-
ing members. Once the chapter is
established with members, it will
participate in official recruitment
like all the other chapters.
Since the fraternity is start-
ing from scratch, all new mem-
bers will start from the same spot
regardless of their year. The exec-

utive positions will be filled by the
accepted numbers in a "hybrid"
form by another application pro-
cess, Fernandez said.
Fernandez added that one of
the main goals of the fraternity
is to bridge the gap between "the
university life and Greek life,
because sometimes, as we know,
they operate separately."
The organization is already
on its way to fulfilling the mis-
sion through creating an advisory
board featuring women, other fra-
ternity members and non-Greeks,
Fernandez said.
Another way Beta is looking to
connect to the University com-
munity is by offering a scholar-
ship to any male that is interested,
regardless of if he is involved in
Greek Life.
"That's something I was
impressed with," Vasicek said.
In addition, Fernandez said the
fraternity is holding itself to much
higher academic standards and
requiring a minimum of 20 hours
of community service to make
membership more than "a mere
social outlet."
Additionally, members of Beta
are required to be part of at least
one other organization on cam-
pus, Fernandez said.
"Beta shouldn't define your
college experience," Fernandez
said. "It should be part of it, but it
shouldn't define it."
Fernandez said the house,
located on State Street where the

The Beta fratnerity house yesterday. Members are slated to move in this

current "Graduate House" resides,
was renovated last summer and
will undergo another renovation
this summer to give it a "classy"
appearance, adding that the house
will be completely substance-free.
"(The house) is a place where
hopefully men are proud to bring
their parents, proud to bring their
friends and their girlfriends," Fer-
nandez said. "It's a place where
(members) can study, where
(members) can have nice things
and when we have events with
alcohol we're going to do it with
class."
Vasicek said Beta's decision

is part of a trend of fraternities
choosing to be substance-free.
"Establishing alcohol-free
housing keeps the focus on the
values of the national fraternity
as opposed to having big parties
at the house," he said. "They also
don't have to worry about some-
one getting hurt or having the
beautiful, historic and expensive
chapter house being destroyed."
Members of Beta will be mov-
ing into the house next fall. The
maximum capacity of the house
is roughly 60, but Fernandez esti-
mates it will probably have 45
members for the next few years.

there is no other 24-hour conve-
nience store in the area, 7-Eleven
will be a good business to have

near campus.
"Students know they're getting
good products for a decent price,"
Chaconas said..
Engineering junior Cailtin
Cramer echoed Chaconas's sen-
timents, saying she was looking

forward to having more options on
campus for food and drinks.
"I'm excited to have new food
choices on campus, including their
Slurpees," Cramer said.
Benne said the 7-Eleven expe-
rience in Ann Arbor will be well-

suited to its customers and their
demands.
"7-Eleven has a sophisticated
system where we know every day,
item-by-item, what is selling and
what doesn't, so we can constantly
tailor the product mix to meet cus-

tomers' needs," Benne said.
Jerome Kamano, owner of Diag
Deli & Pizza, which is located at
340 South State St., said he doesn't
see the new 7-Eleven as competi-
tion because his business provides
good and fast service.

Kamano added that his busi-
ness has the advantage of having
an already established following.
Though convenience stores have
come and gone in the past, they
haven't affected his business,
Kamano said.

J.T. Floyd out for year,
needs ankle surgery

For Michigan, power play
remains a work in progress

ByTIMROHAN
Daily SportsEditor
Just as the Michigan second-
ary tries to get back up and dust
itself off, it gets knocked back down
again.
Before the season, the unit lost its
most experienced player, Troy Wool-
0 folk, to an ankle injury he suffered
in practice. And during the weekly
Big Ten teleconference yesterday,
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
announced that the Wolverines'
current No. 1 cornerback, J.T. Floyd,
would miss the rest of the season
* with an ankle injury.
Floyd injured the ankle during
practice, and Rodriguez said that the
x-rays were negative for a fracture.
But Floyd suffered ligament damage
that will require surgery.
"The unfortunate part of a lot of
it is it's been in practice and we're
not even tackling in practice,"
Rodriguez said. "So it's just kind of
one of those freak things. ... A guy
fell down in front of him and I don't
think he saw it. And he got rolled
up. "
With Woolfolk out before the sea-
son started, Floyd stepped into the
leadership role on an inexperienced
unit. Rodriguez called him the "solid
rock" of the secondary, but now
9 senior cornerback James Rogers,
plus true freshmen Courtney Avery,
Terrence Talbott and Cullen Chris-
tian will have to shoulder the load.
Rogers is a converted wide receiver
who saw little playing time prior to
this season, and none of the fresh-
men have started a single game for
the Wolverines.
Michigan's pass defense has
allowed more than 290 yards per
game with Floyd in the lineup, and
that was only better than three other
Division-I teams - ranking 117th in
the country.
Floyd started all eight games this
season at left cornerback and record-
ed66tackles,four pass breakups and
oneinterception.Rodriguez said that
Avery would start in Floyd's place on
Saturday against Illinois, but that he
would also like to get a couple of the
other younger cornerbacks prepared
to play, too.

Redshirt sophomore cornerback .T. Floyd was Michigan's top cornerback.

"I've been really pleased with
(Avery and Talbott's) development,"
Rodriguez said. "They're both com-
petitive guys, they're just young.
And we know they're going to make
some mistakes and there will be
some growing pains with them. But
they've done a good job in practice
and we're going to try and acceler-
ate the process as far as getting them
ready to play at the level we need
them to play at."
Just five days ago, Rodriguez talk-
ed with the media after the Wolver-
ines' 41-31 loss to Penn State about
how young the secondary was. That
came after a game in which former
walk-on quarterback Matt McGloin
threw for 250 yards and a touch-
down against the Michigan defense.
Rodriguez has maintained all sea-
son that the Wolverines are trying to
get their younger defensive players
up to that level where they can make
contributions.
The defeat at the hands of the Nit-
tany Lions was the third loss in a
row for the Wolverines. And in those
games, the secondary allowed three
touchdown passes against Iowa's
Ricky Stanzi as well as 284 yards to
Michigan State's Kirk Cousins.
Floyd's absence adds injury to
insult.
"I think our guys have seen so
much stuff, whether its injuries or

misfortune or what-have-you, that
it's almostbecome,'Okay, here we go.
We'll hang together. We'll stay all in,'
" Rodriguez said. "It's just another
bump in the road. When you see so
much of it, I don't want to say you get
accustomed to it or get used to it, but
you become resilient toward it. And
I think our guys are very, very resil-
ient. And the next guy will come in,
step up and play."
Michigan's secondary was
already a shell of what it could have
been before Woolfolk and now
Floyd were lost due to injuries. The
Wolverines lost former five-star
recruits Justin Turner (transfer),
Boubacar Cissoko (dismissed from
team) during the past year. And
another potential defensive back,
highly touted Demar Dorsey, was
committed to play at Michigan but
was not admitted to the University
this past spring.
Redshirt sophomore safety Jor-
dan Kovacs is now the only player
starting in the secondary with start-
ing experience prior to this season.
Without Floyd, eight of the 11 players
listed as a defensive back or hybrid
on the depth chart are either true or
redshirt freshmen.
"We're pretty young back there
in the secondary - now we're get-
ting a little bit younger," Rodri-
guez said."

By MARK BURNS
Daily SportsEditor
Before last Christmas, then-
junior forward Louie Capo-
russo had just seven goals and
was nowhere near the torrential
24-goal pace of his sophomore
season. But in the last 15 games
of the season, Caporusso altered
his game mentality to a "keep it
simple, shoot more" philosophy.
And with the modification came
results: 14 goals, 8 assists to be
exact.
This season, the No. 6 Michi-
gan hockey team's power play,
which is converting at a 21-per-
cent rate, could take a page out of
the former Hobey Baker finalist's
book.
While converting one in five
opportunities is certainly respect-
able, with the Wolverines' depth
and senior leadership in Caporus-
so, Carl Hagelin and Matt Rust,
there's no question Michigan (3-0-
1-0 CCHA, 4-1-3 overall) should be
seeing better results with the man
advantage.
"We've turned it over way
too often," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said after Tuesday's
practice. "Certain players have
been guilty of that, and we've got
to change that. ... We know these
teams are good defensively - we
saw it with (Nebraska-Omaha),
we saw it with Ferris (State) -
these teams aren't going to give
you time to look around and
decide what you're going to do
with the puck.
"You've got to do it quick,
you've got to move it and you've
got to know what you're doing
with it."
And as Berenson said, it
starts with not holding onto the
puck for too long and knowing
where the four other players are
on the ice, followed by tape-to-
tape passes, according to Hage-
lin.
"You can see the difference
when we make good passes or
not," Hagelin said. "If you make
a few good passes, the other
team is going to start running
around. If you make a bad pass,
the puck is out (of the zone) right

SALAM 510A/Daily
Senior forward Louie Caporusso will be a key factor on the power play unit this
season for the Wolverines.

away. So, (we're) just making sure
that we're making the right plays
and more patient with the puck
this weekend."
Hagelin added that, in practice
this week, Berenson has the play-
ers executing more of an overload
style of power play before the Wol-
verines' two-game road series at
Alaska (2-1-1-1, 5-2-1) starting Fri-
day. An overload style means the
team attempts to work the puck
off the end boards, as opposed
to an umbrella-type strategy, in
which various plays are gener-
ally executed from the top of the
offensive zone.
But along with a few technical
adjustments, there is definitely
a need to shoot the puck more.
Through the first month of the
season, the Wolverines have accu-
mulated just 49 shots on42 power
plays.
And for Michigan to create

more grade-A scoring opportu-
nities this weekend, it will need
to pepper Fairbanks' netminder
Scott Greenham and future goal-
ies with all the rubber they can
handle.
A certain aspect of the power
play is luck and getting a favorable
bounce here and there. But at the
same time, Hagelin admitted that
with a little persistence and hard
work, the goals are going to come
and the puck is going to bounce
their way eventually.
Said Caporusso, "Sometimes
you get bounces and people will
be like, 'Oh, you have a sweet
power play,' but really you're just
getting lucky. ... It's a lot of luck
actually, when you think about it.
The Pittsburgh Penguins last year
had some of the most talented
guys in the world and the worst
power play in the NHL, so go fig-
ure that one out."

Judging A Book
By Its Cover
Why read a single page when the cover
tells the whole story?

SINGLE REVIEW

For those of you who aren't suf-
ficiently terrified by Nicki Minaj,
check out her new track "Roman's
Revenge." Being
the most con-
spicuous femi-
nine presence in Nicki Minaj
hip hop today, %.Emnem
Minaj certainly
hasalottoprove, "Roman's Revenge"
and this single
off the forthcoming Pink Friday
makes the message resoundingly
clear: Minaj is a "bad bitch," a
"dungeon dragon" and Disney's
Aladdin all rolled into one fire-
breathing package. And if that's
confusing, maybe the legitimately
head-banging beat can help clari-
fy: Don't fuck with her.

But come on, we get it. Here,
Nicki comes on so strong that it
turns the track into a clear case
of overcompensation. The speed-
bag snares, the rabid growling,
the murderous guest verses by a
seething Slim Shady - it's clum-
sily manufactured to sound as
aggressive as possible, thereby
deflating any real fury the song
could have had. Plus, Nicki's
vocal tics have gone from charm-
ing idiosyncrasy to worn-out
shtick before she's even released
an album, which doesn't exactly
augur well for her shelf life. Sure,
Nicki, we'll respect your authori-
ty. But it's just kind of hard to take
you too seriously.

claws and ripping Brave
into the remaining
contestants first.
Ranging from bizarre to boring,
the collections of Gretchen Jones,
Mondo Guerraand AndySouthwere
presented in their full glory. Judges
included fashion editor Nina Gar-
cia, overly tanned designer Michael
Kors, obnoxious supermodel and

host Heidi Klum and, for some rea-
son, musical artist Jessica Simp-
son. While the panel split between
Guerra's Betsey Johnson-meets-
Heatherette collection and Jones's
less-trip-to-the-future-more-dive-
into-the-dumpster palette, South's
Asian-inspired astronomy project
was ruled out less than 15 minutes
in, with no other mention as Klum
shrieked for a pair of boxing gloves
against the aggressive opposition.
Though Guerra proved to be a
fan favorite, Jones, with her urban-
casual collection, was unfortunate-
ly declared season eight champion.
Here's to hoping that next season
is less about tomorrow's trends and
more abouttoday's talent.

Forget other sci-fi time-trav-
eling novels; Cassandra Clare's
"Clockwork Angel (The Infernal
Devices, Book One)" will put the
rest to shame. In 18th-century
London, Samuel Hutchenson
seems just a little out of place,
but when the charismatic Lucy
Greene tries to break open his
aloof and mysterious exterior,
she finds more than she bar-
gained for.
Samuel isn't just a quiet, young
cobbler; he's actually a time-
traveling seraph on a mission for
God. Samuel recruits his young
friend to join him in preventing
the industrial revolution. They
embark on a series of high-stakes
missions to save humanity from
itself.
Never before has a message
been so subtly and intricately

woven into a piece of fiction.
The People's Republic of Heaven
is such a delicate metaphor for
the sublime state of being, only
accessible to those who over-
come dependence on gadgets.
Clare has set up the begin-
ning of what will likely be a very
engaging series. The team of
Lucy, Samuel and their sidekick
dog, Patches, is the most dynamic
since Harry Potter and his gang.
With romantic tensions left unex-
plored and a plan to destroy Big
Ben, we're eagerly awaiting the
release of "Book Two."
If you love gears and top hats,
you'll love "Clockwork Angel."
Modern literature's obsession
with steampunk will only be
fueled after this book is crossed
off everyone's reading list.

departure from 5th Cell's recent,

The teaser trailer offers little

the common expectations for a

out of a "Deus Ex" trailer, which is
just about the best compliment it

Now, 5th Cell has done this kind

while theywere busy makinggames

sounds suspiciously like the fight

If genetic modification is 5th Cell's

let's just take a moment to celebrate
that there are developers out there
capable of catering to both the

In addition to its miscellaneous
collection of discovered objects,
FOUND also provides its custom-
ers with newer items such as soy
lotions and paper products. How-
ever, the store is perhaps most
notable for its diverse assortment
of candles.
"I think we have the best candle
collection in the area," Cambru-
zzi said, picking up a scarlet bird
with a wick on top of its back. On
the shelf below it, more candles are
scattered around: a row of three
green peas squirming in their pods,
twisty birthday candles in the
shape of micelles, fragrant aspara-
gus tapers imported from France,
cylindrical pillars from Charlevoix
that glow from the inside when lit.
FOUND is also known for fea-
turing several works from local
artists in the area, who take recy-
cled items from rummage sales or
antique malls and redesign them to
their own purposes. For instance,
jewelry designer Sue Rosengard,
who ordinarily designs hand-
blown jewelry for the high-end art
gallery Selo/Shevel, has fashioned
for the store a series of green, bud-
get-friendly earrings crafted out of
old sheet music. Local artist Mar-
garet Shaw creates re-purposed
socks out of hand-painted thrift-
store sweaters by re-knitting them
on antique sock machines.
"I like to use old things in my

art. The sock machine kind of goes
hand in hand with reusing things
that already exist," Shaw said.
Shaw initially began learning on
the sock machine with commer-
cialized wool, but made the plunge
into hand-painted sweaters when
looking for new inspiration for her
artwork.
"It was somewhat of a learning
process because the sweaters have
to be taken apart very carefully,
because their knitting is a one-
element process. So when you're
taking them apart, you have to
make sure you're not cutting that
strand," she said.
Another surprising contributor
to FOUND's repository of knick-
knacks is Terri Sarris, a lecturer
in Screen Arts and Cultures who
designs her own "found object
assemblages"- 3-0 collages made
out of letter scraps, rusty nails and
miniature figurines.
"(Found art) is liketelling a story
in a little box," Sarris said. "A box is
a really compellingshape and form
because it's this concise little the-
ater that you build a story around.
I'm also a filmmaker, and I find a
lot of similarity in terms of editing
and putting things together when
telling a story."
Sarris finds inspiration in all
walks of life, from planets to stars
in the sky to birds - even French
martyrs.
"For a while I was doing a Joan
of Arc series," she said. "I had this
little children's book about Joan
of Arc and it told this story of her

Javanese gamelan: from
the World's Fair to the 'U'

True love alters
space and time in
Cloud Tectonics'

By JACOB AXELRAD
DailyArts Writer
Inside a large room in the
School of Music building on
North Campus, the rhythmically
timed sounds of percussion thump.
It's a soft, melodious music, and
distinct from anything else one
might happen to hear around Ann
Arbor. The space is filled with cast
bronze instruments of all shapes
and sizes, arranged in a manner
allowing perfect synchronization.
Everyone sits barefoot and
cross-legged next to their instru-
ments, paying close attention to
a series of numbers written on a
white board. This is the home of
the University's Javanese Gamelan
Ensembles.
Taught at the University since
1967, Javanese Gamelan is musi-
cal style imported from the Indo-
nesian island of Java. A gamelan
is a collection of many instru-
ments meant to always be played
together, comprised of drums,
xylophones and gongs.
"It's a tradition all on its own,
without any standard," said Dr.
Susan Walton, the LSA and Music,
Theater & Dance professor who
leads the group.
Walton describes the gamelan
as "an orchestra, but a specific
orchestra where none of the pieces
can change."
Each gamelan is given a name
that reflects its individual spirit.
"Ours is named Kyai Telaga

Madu, which means 'Venerable
Lake of Honey' because of our
position here in the Great Lakes,"
said Beth Genne, an LSA and
MT&D professor who practices
with the ensemble.
According to Walton, after the
1965 New York City World's Fair
was held, the Indonesian exhibit
tried to auction off its gamelan.
The University went into a bid-
ding war for the gamelan and lost
to Wesleyan University. But when
another gamelan became avail-
able, the University purchased it
directly from Indonesia. Judith
Becker, a graduate student at the
time, hired a Javanese musician
and the first ensemble was born.
Open to all members of the Uni-
versity community, the ensembles
are made up of both a beginning
and an advanced class with two
to three performances each year.
According to Walton, the mem-
bers of the respective groups come
from all areas of the University.
"We've got engineers and
librarians and scientists," she said.
Some students take the courses
to fulfill credit hours, but most
are devoted to the ensembles.
Family is an important aspect of
gamelan, and in Indonesia it's not
uncommon to have both parents
and children involved in the same
ensemble. The University ensem-
bles take this value to heart. From
the students to the faculty, the
participants are committed to this
staple of Indonesian culture.

A musical tradition with deep ed the popularity of the gamelan

"It's not an L.A. of the future,

But it's the play's mysterious and

Celestina meets Anibal, played

hearing voices, and then going

then being burned at the stake.
So I found little things that repre-
sented those various stages of her
life to me."
Among these artists' diverse
found art endeavors, Cambruzzi
maintains that the most popu-
lar items are John Marchello's
silverware bud vases. These
slim vases are made out of a hol-
lowed knife handle with a deli-
cately bent teaspoon as the base.
There's just enough room to hold
a single-stemmed tea rose. Before
he turned his talents to silver-
ware shaping, Marchello used to
design metal hockey and wres-
tling headgear for the Universi-
ty's hockey team back when Red
Berenson played for it. Marchello
also designs silverware angels,
fork wall hooks and spoon rings
for the store.
"I think part of the reason that
they're so popular is because he
writes 'Made in Ann Arbor' and
dates them on the bottom," Cam-
bruzzi said. "For people who are
visiting, what better way to bring
back apiece of the city than to buy
one of these vases?"
Due to the store's limited space,
Cambruzzi must always be selec-
tive about what she brings in.
"I never want to have too much
jewelry or too much old stuff or
too mnch new stiff. hecause the

whole premise of the store is this
mix of the old and the new and
things that are made from recy-
cled, found objects," she said.
This premise even extends to
the objects that she finds.
"Two different times I have
found cabinets that are made of
old wooden cheese boxes," she
said. "Back then, Velveeta cheese
came in (Velveeta-sized boxes),
and in the Depression-era maga-
zines, they have directions on
how to turn those kinds of boxes
into something to store all your
screws in. I've had one that had
four drawers down and six draw-
ers across of just cheese boxes in
a cabinet.
"I love things like that prob-
ably better than anything, things

different purpose."
Indeed, it is FOUND's unique
mixture of vintage knickknacks
and art recycled from them that
have melded the present, past and
imagination into one unforget-
table treasure hunt.
"My store isn't really about
selling old vintage stuff; it's more
about having that element that
is able to connect generations,"
Cambruzzi said. "For instance,
these spoon rings. They used to
be popular when I was a teenager.
Young people come in and buy
them because they think they're
cool or because they want to be
green, but their mothers come in
and say, 'Oh, I remember wearing
those!' There really is that cross-
aenerational link in this store."

SHLIAN
From Page 1B
taught them in class.
In Shlian's Creative Paper Fold-
ing/Engineering class - offered last
semester bythe Lloyd Hall Scholars
Program - students engaged with
paper in a much different way than
they had previously experienced.
Kyla Suchy, a junior in Art and
Design, said that the course was
unique in that the material was the
focus rather than merely a canvas.
"(The class involved) taking
something really two-dimensional
like paper and used it as a medium
to build with instead of something
to draw on," she said.
Suchy said that the course helped
her shift her focus in her own work
from two-dimensional projects to
three-dimensional ones.
"I picked up a lot of skills with
measuring and just being able to
analyze structures a little better,
which are 3-D now and mostly 2-D
before (taking Shlian's class)," she
said.
While some students took a more
formulaic approach in Shlian's
paper engineeringclass, Suchy said
that for her, the class was more of
an exercise in trial and error.
"In order to get things to sit
together right and to open up in
the pop-up books you had to make
sure the angles were right," Suchy
said. "But it was more of an exper-
iment for me. You can be very sci-
entific about it when you're trying
to figure out how things are sup-
posed to function, but you can also
just play around with it."
In the class Tools, Materials
and Processing 1, students collab-
orated on paper sculptures such as
pamphlets and pop-up books, with
each class session geared toward
a different project. Dylan Box, a
junior in art and design as well
as mechanical engineering, said
that paper engineering definitely
played an important role in TMP 1.
"(The class involves) applying
paper techniques to engineering
principles,". Box said. "There's a
lot of work - a ton of math and a
ton of trig to make sure it'll work
geometrically."
"I think that mixing art and
science is very important because
without artistic and creative peo-
ple, the sciences could be a very
un-relatable subject," Box said.
"On the contrary, without sci-
ence and technology, a lot of art
wouldn't exist today. There's an

Matt Shlian started his paper engineering career based on an interest in pop-up books.

animosity between mixing the
two sometimes. But the cross-
disciplinary research is vital to
address the gamut of needs and
issues."
On various projects, Box used
a more scientific approach, which
often baffled fellow art students.
"In TMP1, it wasn't mathematic
to start out with, but I definitely
got really involved mathematically.
I was pulling out my calculator and
protractor while working and get-
ting some weird stares from other
art students," Box said. "There are
a lot of people in the art school who
use math and science without real-
izing it, but you have to know it to
do design work."
Another project in the course
involved packaging design, which
is what Box is currently hoping to
further nursue as a career.

"I'm hoping to do product
design. That stretches everywhere
from the product to the package.
I've definitely applied a lot of Matt
(Shlian)'s principles to current
projects. Without Matt I wouldn't
see package design the same way,"
Box said.
He said that paper engineering
is a combination of the aesthetic
and pragmatic. Not only does the
work have to be visually arresting,
but it must also serve a practical
purpose.
"There's definitely a practi-
cal application. Packaging design,
that's complete paper engineer-
ing," Box said. "Really limited pal-
ate of materials to hold a product,
make sure it doesn't break and
looks nice. If it's not designed well
and engineered well the product
can fall flat."
For a project called "found
typeface," the students were to
construct a version of the alpha-
bet using found materials.
"I took a match and using long
exposure photography I drew
out the letters. Glowing letters
with a little flame at the bottom.
It was really cool," Box said.
Work ethic is crucial in Shl-
ian's classes, and Box said that
it was one of the major aspects
he carried away from Shlian's
class: making sacrifices to mas-
ter a craft.
"I guess one of the big things
was about time, putting in time
for your work," Box said. "We
read the '10,000 hour rule.' The
idea is that to master a subject,
or anything, you have to spend
ten thousand hours doing it.
There are tons of examples,
(like) the Beatles and Bill Gates.
You have to make sacrifices to
become good at what you do. In
the end of it all, you'll be much
better because of it."
In Ann Arbor, outside the
sphere of the University, Shlian
has spawned an artist colony
called (half-seriously) the Dhar-
ma Initiative Artist Collective
- a reference to the television
show "Lost." On the show, the
Dharma Initative is a hippie sci-
entist group from the University

of Michigan that does experiments
on the show's mythical island. The
workspace of Shlian's collective
allows local artists to have a physi-
cal community to share ideas about
their current projects.
Carrie Mood, a local glass art-
ist, was drawn to Shlian through
a mutual friend and is now cur-
rently a member of Shlian's Dhar-
ma Initiative. Since relocating to
Detroit, Mood has switched focus
from high-brow art to more acces-
sible crafts.
Mood met Shlian just over a
year ago when a mutual friend
thought they shared some artistic
interests.
"I'd kind of fallen into the indie
craft scene here," she said, "which
is the furthest from gallery art-
work as possible."
Mood said that the underlying
motivation behind the Dharma
Initiative Artist Collective was to
have a communal space, which she
found difficult to have after college.
"We always talked about having
a studio, but (Shlian) was the one
who really pursued it and got all
these artistson board. Once you get
out of college you don't really have
that community," Mood said. "We
just wanted to influence each other
and inspire each other and help
each other out. We all do our own
separate thing but it's about being
in the company of other artists."
Although artists mostly stick
to their own work, Mood said
that she finds Shlian's presence
beneficial. She is able to use tools
she previously wouldn't have had
access to if not for Shlian, which
has contributed to her personal
growth as an artist.
"It's really nice because (Shlian)
is on the academic side of things so
it's really beneficial for me as an
artist to grow," she said. "There'll
be like some techniques that he
knows and will be familiar with
and help me with my work. I have
some grand ideas to use a Plotter-
Cutter, a machine that cuts paper
that Matt has. I would never have
access to that if it weren't for him."

play's director and a 2010 alum of
the University's School of Music,
Theatre & Dance. "In this case,
time actually does stop."
The two spend a night togeth-
er, represented in the play by a
20-minute scene. When Anibal's
brother Nelson, played by Dear-
born comic Frank Gutierrez, vis-
its the couple, they learn that two
years have passed in the outside
world.
The three characters try to
come to terms with the time that
has passed, which reemphasizes
Celestina's problem of identity.
"She's looking for her place
in the world, because, for her,
time has no meaning, the world
has no meaning," Medelis said.
"She seeks to be always traveling,
always hitchhiking, always wait-
ing for that bus that doesn't seem
to be coming.
"She's lost and looking for
answer that it seems the rest of
the world has."
The first season of TNTP is
themed "Identity," so Med'elis

also chose this play because of its
prevalent questions of personal
place.
Medelis explained that a lot
of Rivera's work is about what it
means to be Latino in America
and how he thinks many Latinos
are losing the identity associated
with their cultural heritage. It
is a theme that touches "Cloud
Tectonics" as well. The play has
a Spanish-language monologue,
but Anibal has forgotten his first
language and can't understand.
If the play investigates the need
for identity and the effects of love,
it also points out that identity and
love can't be understood.
The play's title, "Cloud Tecton-
ics," is the science of how clouds
move. It is drawn from a line in
the play that discusses Celes-
tina's need for love; understand-
ing this necessity is "like trying
to understand the anatomy of
the wind or the architecture of
silence or cloud tectonics."
"Cloud Tectonics" explores the
relativity of time, but finds that
in the complex realm of human
emotion, nothing can provide all
of the answers. Some things -
and people - exist outside the
world of natural lawls.
