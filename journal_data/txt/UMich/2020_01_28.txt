In 2018, Engineering senior 
Barry Chen went to his first 
and last career fair to look 
for 
aerospace 
engineering 
internships. Before the fair, he had 
already done research on which 
companies would be willing to 
hire international students.
“When we had a career fair, we 
had a list of companies, and we 
could also check if they want to 
sponsor international students,” 
Chen said. “I checked it, and turns 
out very few of them (sponsor), 
although there are some. Many 
of them give answers like ‘we 

may sponsor,’ but it’s not for sure. 
Maybe it depends on the job 
they want to offer you, maybe it 
depends on the spots available for 
internships.”
Despite the research he had 
done, after spending his day 
talking to multiple companies, 
he realized he wasn’t going to 
receive an offer because of his 
immigration status. Chen looked 
further 
into 
companies 
and 
realized that many jobs require 
a United States citizenship or a 
green card or a higher educational 
degree. 
“I understand it’s not possible 
for me to find intern(ships) while 
I’m still undergrad,” Chen said.
International students have 

a choice of F-1 — or student visa 
— employment options while 
they are at the University. The 
most 
common 
are 
Optional 
Practical Training and Curricular 
Practical Training for short-term 
employment, such as internships.
Currently, 
the 
processing 
time for OPT applications is 
more than 90 days. In the case 
of 
Rackham 
student 
María 
Alejandra Rodríguez Mustafa, 
the processing time caused her to 
lose an internship offer during the 
summer of 2019.
“I got an offer, but I got it very 
late, so it was very hard to do all 
the paperwork,” Mustafa said. 
“So in the end, the timing was not 
great because I could not start and 

be continuing with the company 
for the time they required me. I 
could not go.”
For 
full-time 
jobs 
after 
graduation, companies must be 
willing to sponsor an international 
student and submit an H-1B, or 
visa for temporary workers, on 
their behalf. This visa allows them 
to stay for up to six years. 
However, according to the U.S. 
Citizenship 
and 
Immigration 
Services, there is a congressionally 
mandated cap of 65,000 H-1B 
visas and an additional 20,000 
“advanced degree exemption” for 
the 2020 fiscal year. In addition, 
according 
to 
the 
American 
Immigration 
Council,

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Three 
historic 
homes 
located on the corner of 
East Huron Street and Glen 
Avenue, currently owned by 
the University of Michigan, 
may be demolished for a 
new College of Pharmacy, 
according 
to 
November 
2019 advertisement for the 
sale and removal of the 
houses. 
The proposal for a new 
$121 
million, 
130,000 
square foot building was 
approved 
in 
May 
2019. 

According 
to 
a 
project 
proposal, 
the 
current 
College of Pharmacy has 
narrow 
structural 
bays 
and shallow floor-to-floor 
heights which do not allow 
for 
reconfiguration 
into 
modern 
classroom 
and 
laboratory spaces. The new 
building will have more 
space to accommodate for 
academic, 
research 
and 
student needs. 
University spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen said in 
an email to The Daily if the 
houses are not purchased 
and moved from the current 

site, they will be demolished 
in the upcoming summer.
“There 
haven’t 
been 
any 
proposals 
submitted 
to purchase, and if that 
remains to be the case, over 
the summer they would be 
demolished,” Broekhuizen 
said.
Ann 
Arbor 
historian 
Susan Wineberg, who lives 
in the District, said she 
was disappointed with the 
decision to demolish these 
houses. 
“I broke it down to myself 
as being bad for three 
reasons,” Wineberg said. 

“One is, of course, historical 
because of the people who 
occupied those houses. It’s 
important to the University 
of Michigan. The second 
reason 
is 
architectural 
because they’re very good 
representations 
of 
three 
different 
architectural 
styles from 1891 through 
1905 and they’re in very 
good condition. The third 
reason is an environmental 
one because we say the 
greenest building is the one 
that’s already built.”

A2 Burger 
joint shuts 
down two 
locations

This 
past 
week, 
both 
of 

Ann 
Arbor’s 
Elevation 
Burger 

restaurants unexpectedly closed 

permanently. A small sign on the 

door alerted customers to the 

closure and thanked them for their 

business. University of Michigan 

alumni Sarah and Mike Tayter 

opened the organic burger joint in 

downtown Ann Arbor in 2015. 

Elevation was known for its 

100% organic, free-range and grass-

fed beef and offered a selection 

of vegan and vegetarian burgers, 

sandwiches, 
fries, 
milkshakes 

and salads. With one location on 

Washtenaw Avenue and another on 

East Liberty Street, the Virginia-

based chain was accessible to Ann 

Arbor locals and students.

regular, 
expressed 

disappointment at the restaurant’s 

sudden closing because it is just one 

of many local Ann Arbor businesses 

that has shut its doors in the past 

year. 

“I just thought it was really sad 

in general just to see so many places 

in Ann Arbor closing, especially when 

Elevation Burger was I think family-

owned, so it’s really sad to see that 

happen,” Khan said. 

Khan also elaborated on Elevation’s 

inclusive menu, explaining that it

Though 
the 
presidential 
debate to be hosted at the 
University of Michigan is nine 
months away, Central Student 
Government 
held 
its 
third 
presidential debate town hall 
Monday 
night 
in 
Pierpont 
Commons to discuss student 
engagement, 
inclusion 
and 
safety. 
Less than half of University 
students voted in the last 
presidential election, a rate 
which 
Catherine 
Carver, 
operations 
co-lead 
of 
the 
2020 Debate Initiative, called 
“extraordinarily low.” Carver 
said 
the 
Debate 
Initiative 
hopes 
to 
increase 
student 
turnout and engagement in the 
democratic process as a whole 
by hosting voter registration 
drives, soliciting student input 
and launching a campus-wide 
theme semester in the fall. 
“A key part of a democratic 
society doesn’t mean just going 
to the voting booths, but that 
there are other things we can 
do to be active and engaged 
citizens,” Carver said. 
Though the Debate Initiative 

wants 
students 
to 
engage 
with the democratic process 
beyond the night of the debate, 
Carver acknowledged student 
frustrations about the limited 
number of seats available to 
students at the debate itself. 
The 
Crisler 
Center 
can 
accommodate close to 13,000, 
but only 800 to 1000 seats will 
be available for the debate 
in 
total. 
The 
Commission 
on Presidential Debates, the 
nonprofit that produces the 
debates, will receive one-third 
of the tickets, and distribute 
a portion to the University to 
allocate. The remaining two-
thirds will be reserved for 
political parties. The Debate 
Initiative will be facilitating 
viewing parties across campus 
for students not selected to 
watch in the Crisler Center.
CSG and the Office of Student 
Life recognized the climate 
surrounding the debate will 
be 
politically 
charged 
and 
may make some students feel 
uncomfortable or unsafe on 
campus. CSG president Ben 
Gerstein, Public Policy junior, 
and Laura Blake Jones, Dean 
of Student Life, created the 
Campus 
Climate 
Advisory 
Council, a standing body that

will be composed of students 
from 
across 
campus, 
with 
inclusion and equity in mind. 
Gerstein told The Daily the 
CCAC application will soon be 
sent to all students by email, 
and the Council will 
select 
students 
with 
the goal of representing 
a diversity of student 
voices. 
“The main thing we’re 
trying to ensure … with 
the selection of groups 
and the way we’ve sort 
of 
put 
together 
the 
CCAC, 
we 
hope 
it’s 
representative 
of 
the 
larger 
organizations 
on campus that already 
reach 
hundreds 
and 
thousands of students,” 
Gerstein said. “Our goal 
would be for those who are 
members of this who aren’t 
in any of those organizations, 
who do not have access through 
any of those organizations, 
to represent the individual 
student 
experience, 
maybe 
that’s not in the organizations 
represented.” 
Gerstein said many decisions 

regarding student participation 
and 
engagement, 
including 
debate day transportation and 
class attendance, will not be 
decided without student input. 
The CCAC will begin biweekly 
meetings 
in 
February 
and 
transition to weekly meetings 
in the fall. 
John Seto, deputy director of 

operations for the Department 
of Public Safety and Security, 
emphasized the importance of 
collaboration in the process of 
securing the campus. 
Seto 
said 
partnerships 
with other law enforcement 
organizations 
have 
already 
been established at the local, 
state and national levels and 

that DPSS plans on utilizing 
student input in the process. 
He also said student concerns 
about residence hall security 
will be integrated into safety 
planning. 
In response to a student 
question about how political 
demonstrations 
will 
be 
handled, 
Seto 
said 
law 

enforcement 
will 
protect 
free speech and the right to 
associate, but will not tolerate 
destruction 
of 
property 
or 
harm to students. Seto also 
stressed 
the 
nuances 
in 
policing the event. 
“A large police presence 
does not always equal feeling 
safer, especially with a lot of 

our communities that are on 
the margins or people that may 
feel the extra police presence is 
actually a threat,” Seto said.
Austin 
Glass, 
Rackham 
student and CSG representative, 
attended the town hall to learn 
more about what will be done 
to ensure a sense of safety for 
students. In an interview with 
The Daily, Glass said he 
appreciates the level of 
planning thus far, but 
urged students to keep a 
close eye on the process.
“Academically 
and 
educationally, 
(the 
debate) provides a lot 
of opportunities, but 
there are a lot of safety 
and cultural challenges 
… There are a lot of 
students, and I’m one 
of them, who have a 
lot of questions and a 
lot of concerns,” Glass 
said. “And that’s not 
to say they’re showstopping 
concerns, red flag, call-the-
show-off concerns, but I think 
that their concerns deserve 
the level of planning that’s 
going into this right now, and 
it deserves our attention to 
make sure that doesn’t fall off.” 

The homes were all built 
before 1944. When acquired 
by 
the 
University, 
the 
houses all served as various 
administrative buildings. 
The home located at 1007 E. 
Huron, currently serves as a 
supplemental building for the 
LSA administration. Charles 
Whitman, 
railroad 
tycoon 
and State Commissioner of 
Railroads, built it in 1891 and 
the University bought the home 
in 1936. 
Wineberg 
said 
the 
community was largely kept 
in the dark on the discussion 
about plans for demolishing the 
houses before the University 
confirmed this location for the 
College of Pharmacy.
“One of the things I wish 
they had done was let us know 
of other sites that would be 
considered for the Pharmacy 

School,” 
Wineberg 
said. 
“I 
still think there might be more 
appropriate places to look for a 
School of Pharmacy than in a 
neighborhood of houses.”
The second house, located 
at 1015 E. Huron, was the 
first place of residence for the 
University’s 
Alpha 
Chapter 
of Nu Sigma Nu, which is the 
oldest medical fraternity in the 
United States. Spier and Rohns, 
a famous Detroit architectural 
firm that also designed the 
University’s Kelsey Museum 
of Archaeology and the Gandy 
Dancer restaurant, built the 
second home. The house is 
currently unoccupied. 
Wineberg said she believes 
the demolition of these homes 
would be contradictory to the 
University’s 
commitment 
to 
sustainability.
“The 
whole 
question 
of 
sustainability 
is 
something 
that they’re (the University) 
proposing 
and 
yet 
this 
is 
not a sustainable behavior,” 

Wineberg said. “Lots of things 
have been dismissed about 
demolition not being a green 
thing to do, so wanting to 
be green and tearing down 
buildings are contradictory.”
The house located at 1027 E. 
Huron was built in 1895 and 
purchased by the University in 
1938. It was built for Josephine 
Murfin, whose son later became 
a regent for the University. 
It is currently the location 
of 
University’s 
Telefund, 
a 
fundraising initiative as part of 
the Annual Giving Department. 
Wineberg 
expressed 
her 
displeasure at the University’s 
decision to destroy historical 
buildings she has worked for 
years to protect, especially as 
these houses are a few blocks 
away from her own home.
“It affects me personally, 
too because I’m thinking ‘Oh, 
they’re creeping down Huron 
and pretty soon they’re going to 
be in my backyard,’” Wineberg 
said. “The last of my 30 years 

of life have been devoted 
to 
preserving 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
historic buildings, so of course 
it’s important to me. I think 
they’re unusually important 
buildings that represent what 
the town was like in the 19th 
century and its connections to 
the University.” 
Pharmacy 
student 
Kevin 
Hosseini said since the College 
of 
Pharmacy’s 
teaching, 
research and office spaces are 
distributed 
across 
different 
locations on campus, a new 
building in the historic district 
will be helpful in meeting 
students’ needs.
“The building is very old, so of 
course I am excited for the new 
building and believe it will help 
future students focus on their 
studies by having their own 
building rather than sharing 
with the LSA college,” Hosseini 
said. “The one limitation to 
the current building is simply 
limited studying space.”

Because of his frustrating 
experience at the career fair 
and finding internships, Chen 
said he does not plan to attend 
another fair. To open up his 
job prospects and cultivate 
his interests, Chen said he is 
planning on attending graduate 
school and has been focusing on 
using his summers for research 
instead. 
According 
to 
Chen, 
his 
struggle is shared by many 
international students. Though 
some are able to find jobs at big 
companies, the opportunities 
are few.
Some 
large 
companies, 
like Google, have branches in 
multiple countries. Rackham 
student Siyin Zheng said she 
tried applying to the U.S. 
branch of global organizations 
but found she was discouraged 
from doing so by the companies.
“Some specific companies 
will tell you that they have 
branches in China or in other 
countries,” Zheng said. “So, 
if you are an international 
student, 
unfortunately, 
we 
encourage you to apply to those 

positions in your own country.” 
LSA freshman Lola Yang 
is from Canada and said she 
is already facing difficulties 
gaining 
work 
experience 
through 
internships. 
Yang 
said she is looking to find 
internships in the U.S. because 
there are more opportunities 
aligned 
with 
her 
interests 
in journalism and language 
immersion.
“Canada is a good country, 
but 
there 
aren’t 
as 
many 
opportunities,” Yang said. “For 
opportunities I’m looking for ... 
there just isn’t an environment 
like that.”
Yang and Chen both said it is 
important to find internships 
in the U.S. if someone wants to 
continue living and working in 
the country after graduation. 
Yang said going home could put 
one at a cultural disadvantage. 
“For international students, 
once you go home, you can be 
really out of touch from the 
country that you attend college 
in,” Yang said. “If you do want 
to gain experience and grow, 
you need to start looking out 
for opportunities early on.”
Engineering 
junior 
Sara 
Bashir is a Canadian citizen 
and green card holder. As a 
nuclear engineering major, she 
said many of the jobs she seeks 
are government contracted and 
require U.S. citizenship. 
“It’s just frustrating because 

a lot of times my advisor 
will forward us emails about 
internships or opportunities, 
and the first thing I do is check 
— does it say that you have to be 
a U.S. citizen?” Bashir said.
Bashir is now looking for 
work in Canada since she 
is barred from government 
jobs in the U.S. To open up 
more opportunities, she has 
worked at Michigan Medicine 
because it doesn’t require U.S. 
citizenship.
“Because medical physics is 
the least restrictive in terms 
of clearance levels, it kind 
of guided me into the field,” 
Bashir said. 
Mariella 
Mecozzi, 
senior 
assistant 
director 
of 
Pre-
Professional Services at the 
University Career Center, said 
in an email to The Daily that 
international 
students 
face 
unique challenges during job or 
internship search processes.
“Job searching is hard for 
all students, but international 
students have the additional 
challenge of having to operate 
within the restrictions and 
timelines dictated by their 
visa type and having to adapt 
to different cultural norms,” 
Mecozzi wrote. “As for the 
reasons why things are the 
way they are, the U.S. is not 
alone in having rules governing 
employment 
eligibility. 
U.S. 
employers 
are 
required 
to 

check the work authorization 
of every worker they hire or 
they can face stiff penalties.”
The 
job 
or 
internship 
application form can also prove 
to be a frustrating process for 
international students. Zheng 
said 
her 
past 
experiences 
with these online applications 
were frustrating because they 
asked whether she was an 
international student or not.
“When 
you 
apply 
for 
a 
job and fill out a form, there 
is an option that you need 
sponsorship in the future or 
not, are you an international 
student?” 
Zheng 
said. 
“If 
you click yes, sometimes the 
computer will automatically 
kick you out. You may not even 
have the opportunity to do the 
next step.”
Mustafa said she encountered 
similar experiences and heard 
that 
once 
students 
check 
the 
box 
marking 
them 
as 
international, their application 
can get filtered out of the 
system.
“It’s 
really 
frustrating, 
right?” Mustafa said. “Because 
you cannot lie, but then you 
know that by checking that 
box, you’re probably getting an 
automatic out.”
Outside 
of 
status, 
international 
students 
said 
they also face another barrier 
— language. 
In an email to The Daily, 

Kerri 
Boivin, 
director 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Engineering 
Career Resource Center, said 
international 
students 
often 
struggle with language and 
lack of awareness about U.S. 
business culture. 
“We encourage international 
students to immerse themselves 
in 
campus-based 
cultural 
experiences such as intramural 
sports, residence hall activities, 
student 
organizations 
and 
project teams,” Boivin said. 
“We’ve seen that those who 
take tangible steps to step 
outside of their comfort zone in 
some of these areas have been 
able to navigate the U.S. job 
search with more effectiveness 
than others.”
Zheng said she has felt 
overlooked as an applicant 
because English is not her first 
language.
“I’m not native speaker,” 
Zheng said. “In this case, I 
might not be as competitive as 
other native speakers. I feel like 
those companies may feel like, 
‘Okay, those native speakers 
meet my needs, so why bother 
other international students?’’”
To 
better 
improve 
her 
prospects, Zheng is involved 
in 
Graduate 
Rackham 
International 
and 
uses 
the 
University 
Career 
Alumni Network to conduct 
informational 
interviews. 
She 
also 
attends 
company 

information sessions to network 
and visits the University Career 
Center to have her resume 
critiqued when gearing up for 
the career fair.
When 
asked 
how 
international 
students 
could 
better 
improve 
their 
application prospects despite 
the 
challenges, 
Mecozzi 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of using University resources, 
creating 
strong 
connections 
and researching the field when 
job hunting.
“Take 
a 
multi-pronged 
approach to your job search by 
becoming more knowledgeable 
about the type of opportunities 
you are pursuing,” Mecozzi 
wrote. 
“But 
perhaps 
more 
important 
than 
anything, 
(leverage) online networks and 
mechanisms to connect with 
alumni and other individuals 
currently 
working 
in 
your 
chosen industry or job function, 
like 
the 
University 
Career 
Alumni 
Network, 
LinkedIn, 
etc.”
While 
these 
approaches 
work 
for 
some, 
Mustafa 
said the University could do 
more 
to 
help 
international 
graduate students. She said 
she 
believes 
the 
current 
resources are targeted towards 
the domestic students rather 
than 
international 
students, 
particularly when it comes to 
graduate students. 

the presidential debates into 
our already existing classes 
and 
thinking 
about 
the 
themes of participation and 
democracy,” Beatty said.
The 
committee 
also 
discussed 
lighting 
standards for the University 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 
light 
pollution. The city of Ann 
Arbor is in the final stages of 
its light pollution policies. 
The committee said the 
University needs to keep up 
with the city’s policies and 
outline the steps they are 
taking to address this issue.
Senate Assembly Member 
Neil 
Marsh 
brought 
up 
electronic 
voting 
as 
a 
potential agenda item. The 
members 
also 
discussed 
the 
policies 
surrounding 
the proper use of e-voting 
and whether e-voting was 
a good way to carry out 
SACUA elections. MaryJo 
Banasik, director of the 
Faculty 
Senate 
Office, 
outlined the issues that 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
before the electronic voting 
platform is in place. 
“I just want to make sure 
that the system is up and 
ready 
in 
time,” 
Banasik 
said. “If we’re going to use 
the voting platform then 
it needs to be set up so 
that there’s a U-M login, 
so that it’s secure and our 
IT surfaces are working 
on securing that and may 
have to have a contract for 
procurement services and 
they have been working 
on finalizing that. So if all 
those items are done then it 
should be available to use.” 
The 
committee 
also 
addressed the possibility of 
reorganizing underutilized 
committees. 
Members 
drafted their reasons for 

merging, discontinuing or 
starting new committees 
and sent those concerns out 
to other senate advisory 
committee members. 
The committees discussed 
merging 
the 
committees 
that are not as active, like 
the Tri-Campus Committee 
and CIU, with those that 
are more productive like the 
Committee on Civil Rights 
and Liberties. They said 
this would increase their 
overall reach and give them 
more of a mandate to act on 
issues. 
“We thought if we could 
put those three together 
that would be a way to make 
sure that there would be 
enough meat for all of them 
to sink their teeth into,” 
Beatty said.
Senate Assembly member 
David 
Potter 
led 
the 
discussion 
on 
 
forming 
a committee for judicial 
review. They acknowledged 
these mergers would also 
result in some members 
being bumped off of certain 
committees due to lack of 
space.
“A 
faculty 
judicial 
committee 
is 
a 
pretty 
standard 
feature 
on 
campuses,” 
Potter 
said. 
“Potentially we might be 
able to find a way to expand 
the curve especially in cases 
of grievances.”

Senate 
Assembly 

member Sara Ahbel-Rappe 
reintroduced 
the 
One 
University Campaign and 
supporting the Dearborn 
and Flint campuses, which 
was brought up in previous 
SACUA meetings. 
“It seems like a time we 
really need to try to think 
about the One University 
issue and how to support 
the 
other 
campuses,” 
Ahbel-Rappe 
said. 
“We 
should devote some love to 
answering this question.”

The importance of the Asian American vote

O

ver winter break, I binged 
the 
recent 
season 
of 
“Patriot Act with Hasan 
Minhaj” on Netflix. In one episode, 
“Don’t Ignore the Asian Vote in 
2020,” Minhaj sat down with 
presidential candidates to discuss 
why Asian Americans — despite 
being one of the fastest-growing 
racial populations — are severely 
underrepresented 
in 
politics. 
During the 2018 midterms, Asian 
Americans made up only 3 percent 
of the electorate. However, Asian 
Americans make up 10 percent of 
the electorate in competitive swing 
states like Nevada and Virginia, 
and they are expected to make up 5 
percent of the 2020 electorate. This 
will likely have a lot of influence in 
the 2020 elections, especially with 
the currently crowded Democratic 
primary field. 
The historical lack of outreach to 
Asian Americans has contributed to 
low voter registration and turnout. 
Andrew Yang, entrepreneur and 
presidential candidate, admits the 
problem is that politicians didn’t 
reach out to Asian Americans. 
According to a 2018 Asian American 
Voter Survey by AAPI Data, the 
majority of Asian Americans had 
little to no contact from Democrats 
or 
Republicans. 
This 
includes 
community 
organizations 
and 
individual candidates. The reality of 
a majority-white party that depends 
mostly on voters of color, yet lacks 
the resolution to reach out to these 
communities, has become clear. 
Candidates like Yang and former 
candidates like Sen. Cory Booker, 
D-N.J., Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. 
and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, 
encourage the public to engage in 
politics by showing that Asians 
and people of color can be political 
leaders as well.
The overall underrepresentation 
of people of color in politics was clear 
on the all-white Democratic debate 
stage in January. A once diverse 
primary field has shrunk down to 
only three non-white Democratic 
candidates. Even Yang, who has 

been consistently polling within 
the top seven candidates and raised 
over $15 million during the third 
quarter, didn’t make the cut for the 
debate. The solution, though, isn’t 
necessarily having more candidates 
and politicians of color. The problem 
itself, as explained by Eugene Scott 
from the Washington Post, is that 
most of the issues “discussed at the 
debate — including health care, the 
economy and the environment — 
are race-related.” And yet, people of 
color, especially Asian Americans, 
are left out of the conversation. These 
issues concern and most significantly 
affect people of color, compared to 
white Americans, but candidates 
fail to show devotion to getting these 
communities involved. 
In 
his 
episode, 
Minhaj 
interviews 
Asians 
in 
New 
York City, and they voice their 
concerns related to “immigration, 
student loans and small business.” 
Having grown up in NYC, I have 
seen first hand that Asian-owned 
businesses dominate the city, from 
cafes to restaurants to salons. 
The Census Bureau reported 
that “between 2007 and 2012, 
the number of U.S. businesses 
owned by Asian-Americans rose 
23.8 percent.” This growth is 10 
times more than that of all United 
States firms over the same period. 
Asians will arguably benefit the 
most from a strong economy 
and, as a growing voting block, 
can influence economic policies. 
This can be seen in the 2018 
midterm elections, a year where 
immigration was — and currently 
is — a widely debated topic. The 
voter turnout rates for both U.S.-
born and naturalized Asians, the 
second-largest immigrant group, 
were up by more than 10 percent 
compared to 2014.
Asian American voter turnout 
rates have always lagged behind 
those of other racial groups. It 
is estimated that about 3 in 10 
eligible Asian voters cast ballots 
in 2018 despite there being a 
whopping nine million eligible 

voters. However, today’s second-
generation Asians, like Andrew 
Yang, are getting involved in politics 
and the younger Asian American 
generations are becoming eligible to 
vote. Hopefully, we can encourage 
Asian participation in politics 
and remind politicians that we 
are part of the conversation as 
well. As a Democratic-leaning 
block, the Asian American vote 
definitely isn’t one to be ignored 
in the Democratic primaries and 
the upcoming election. 
I recently had the chance 
to listen to Edie Goldenberg, 
professor of political science and 
public policy at the University of 
Michigan. In 2017, she helped start 
the Big Ten Voting Challenge, a 
non-partisan initiative dedicated 
to increasing voter registration 
and 
turnout 
among 
college 
students across college campuses. 
At the University, Goldenberg 
started the student group, Turn 
Up Turnout (TUT), to increase 
voter registration and turnout 
among 
all 
communities 
on 
campus. The Edward Ginsberg 
Center for Community Service 
and Learning is spearheading the 
efforts through student-driven 
tabling at campus-wide events 
and orientation, panel discussions, 
workshops 
and 
social 
media 
campaigns. 
As younger generations begin 
to outvote older generations, 
we as young voters need to 
start addressing the problems 
of 
underrepresentation 
and 
involvement in politics not 
only among Asians, but other 
racial groups. We can start 
by registering to vote and 
reaching out to all of our 
communities, 
starting 
with 
our peers. We can get involved 
and volunteer with TUT, or do 
our own part by registering 
to vote before the democratic 
primaries.

Citizens United — a catalyst for corruption
I

n 
mid-January, 
the 
United States had the 
pleasure of celebrating 
the 10-year anniversary of the 
controversial Citizens United 
v. Federal Election Committee 
Supreme Court case. The 
case 
was 
filed 
against 
the FEC by the political 
action 
committee 
Citizens 
United over regulations on 
funding 
and 
restrictions 
on 
advertisements 
before 
elections. 
The 
Bipartisan 
Campaign 
Reform 
Act, 
or 
BCRA, 
prevented 
corporations 
or 
special 
interest groups from funding 
political advertising through 
their 
general 
treasury. 
The 
District 
Court 
for 
Washington, 
D.C. 
upheld 
the law, but the case was 
appealed 
and 
overturned 
in 
the 
Supreme 
Court. 
Corporations had the same 
rights as individuals when it 
came to spending money on 
campaigns, it was decided. 
In the decade since the case 
was decided, the political 
landscape 
has 
morphed 
into 
something 
entirely 
unrecognizable.
In 
the 
2010 
midterm 
elections, 
campaign 
expenditures 
skyrocketed 
from $64 million to $294 
million. Nearly half of that 
money came from newly-
formed 
Political 
Action 
Committees (PACs) that are 
able to conceal their donors. 
This “dark money” had been 
present since Buckley v. Valeo 
in 1976, a Supreme Court 
case that eased disclosure 
requirements 
for 
political 
donations. But, in the wake of 
the Citizens United decision, 
these donations now have 
a sheen of legitimacy. The 
numbers continue to rise, and 
over a billion dollars were 
spent on advertisements for 
the 2018 midterms.
The years following the 
decision also gave rise to 
a 
new 
group 
of 
donors. 
Although this group is small 
in 
number, 
they 
have 
a 
disproportionate sway over 
the electoral process. Out of 
the $4.5 billion dollars raised 
by super PACs in the past 
eight years, $1 billion came 
from only 11 people, who are 
from both Republican and 
Democratic 
backgrounds. 
Funnily 
enough, 
two 
of 
the men on the list were 
Michael Bloomberg and Tom 
Steyer, both of whom are 
now running for president. 
Bloomberg spent a record 
$100 
million 
dollars 
in 
a 
month, 
furthering 
the 
financial bar for entry. 
The shockwaves the ruling 
sent through the legal system 
are even felt in the chaos 

of the Trump impeachment 
trial. Lev Parnas, one of 
Rudy 
Giuliani’s 
associates 
and one of the figures central 
to the Ukraine controversy, 
apparently cozied up to the 
Commander in Chief at an 
event held by the president 
for donors to Trump’s PAC, 
America First Action. The 
donations came through via 
a limited liability company to 
conceal the identity of Parnas 
and his cohort, Igor Fruman. 
Through this, he was able 
to begin negotiations with 
Trump 
about 
the 
Biden 
investigation 
and 
the 
obstruction of the American 
ambassador 
to 
Ukraine, 
Marie 
Yovanovitch. 
The 
Citizens United case allowed 
Parnas to conceal his true 
intentions and easily stay 
under the radar.

A 
few 
more 
examples 
of dark money in politics 
compromising officials can 
be seen in the reluctance to 
combat price-fixing in the 
medical industry and the utter 
incompetence in legislating 
big 
tech. 
In 
2019, 
the 
industry that spent the most 
on lobbying was the health 
sector, coming in at about 
$594 million. A majority of 
that was spent on combating 
legislation 
that 
involved 
price 
control 
on 
certain 
drugs, while another sum of 
it was spent on combating 
the 
Trump 
administration 
agenda 
to 
decrease 
drug 
prices. The industry’s efforts 
to stall regulations stings in 
the face of the absurd and 
unaffordable 
pricing 
for 
prescription drugs.
In 
terms 
of 
tech, 
companies like Facebook and 
Google have been investing 
heavily in lobbying. Their 
spending has been ramping 
up in the face of privacy 
concerns and unfair market 
practices, obviously trying 
to 
influence 
lawmakers 
to get off their proverbial 
backs. 
It’s 
incredibly 
difficult to fully gauge how 
much Capitol Hill has been 
compromised 
by 
lobbying 
and dark money, but the 
mere fact that we have to 
consider the prospect is the 
impetus to reform. 

Despite 
the 
frustrating 
state of campaign finance, 
one 
thing 
rings 
true. 
Americans overwhelmingly 
want to see a decrease in 
political spending. In 2018, 
Pew Research determined 
that 77 percent of people 
believe there should be limits 
in place on expenditures. 
It’s a bipartisan conviction, 
with 71 percent of right-
leaning 
people 
and 
85 
percent 
of 
left-leaning 
people supporting limits on 
money in politics. Recently, 
we’ve 
seen 
candidates 
denounce 
donations 
from 
PACs of questionable origin. 
Candidates for president have 
shown it’s indeed possible to 
sustain a race on small donors. 
Candidates Elizabeth Warren 
and Bernie Sanders have both 
sworn 
off 
PAC 
donations 
altogether, 
each 
raising 
millions of dollars. Despite 
jokes about his wine cave 
fundraiser, 
Pete 
Buttigieg 
has raised nearly half of 
his $50,000,000 from small 
individual 
contributions 
of $200 or less. Grassroots 
campaigning 
has 
become 
more and more popular. 
Tides are changing, but the 
influence Citizens United has 
had on the way politicians 
approach fundraising is clear. 
Dark money is sickeningly 
pervasive, keeping us guessing 
about whether or not our 
elected 
officials 
serve 
the 
people 
or 
special 
interest 
groups. 
Constituents 
have 
noticed and are trying to 
combat that with campaigns 
that draw from smaller donors. 
Large scale donors have upped 
the scale to match, with players 
like Michael Bloomberg and 
Tom 
Steyer 
quite 
literally 
buying 
themselves 
a 
bid 
for the nomination. It’s only 
been a decade, but the nature 
of 
campaigning 
has

Nuclear power — bridging the divide on climate legislation
N

uclear power remains 
the 
United 
States’ 
largest carbon-neutral 
source of energy, and in order 
to 
transition 
to 
a 
carbon-
neutral 
economy 
by 
mid-
century, we must increase our 
reliance on nuclear power. In 
contrast with the majority of 
environmental propositions to 
date, nuclear power has strong 
potential for bipartisan support, 
stemming from demands for 
carbon neutrality as well as 
demands for national security. 
As such, a revival in nuclear 
power is the only realistic way 
to bridge the political divide 
on climate legislation in the 
U.S. and catalyze an approach 
to the climate crisis that is 
proportional to its severity. 
Support for nuclear investment 
is diverse, and consequently 
politically viable in a divided 
congressional 
environment. 
Nuclear technology is pertinent 
in both the industries of nuclear 
power and nuclear weaponry, 
meaning that the benefits of 
nuclear investment are twofold. 
Interests in carbon neutrality 
and 
interests 
in 
nuclear 
deterrence 
and 
global 
non-
proliferation are both satisfied 
by investment in nuclear power. 
According to every realistic 
estimate, 
nuclear 
power 
is 
essential to reaching carbon 
neutrality 
by 
mid-century 
and staying below a rise in 
temperature of two degrees 
celsius. Meanwhile, in order to 
remain at the forefront of global 
nuclear policy, the U.S. must 
build credibility by sustaining 
nuclear 
investment. 
This 
amalgam of political support is 
perfectly exemplified by recent 
bipartisan support for a bill 
from the Senate Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources 
for nuclear investment in energy 
and military applications.
Almost 
every 
Obama-era 
environmental regulation was 
fought to the bitter end by 
Republican congressmen, and 
President Donald Trump began 
his onslaught of environmental 
deregulation almost as soon as 
he was inaugurated. But that 
narrative isn’t holding true 
with nuclear power. Trump 
even claimed that the country 
must “reinvigorate the entire 
nuclear fuel supply chain,” 
claiming that the U.S. should 

pursue 
“national 
security 
and non-proliferation goals.” 
Obviously, Trump’s motives 
are 
rooted 
in 
national 
security goals, but the ends 
justify the means. Nuclear 
power is a bipartisan enigma, 
and in order to realistically 
reach carbon neutrality in 
the U.S., green energy goals 
must reorient around nuclear 
power. 
While the support for nuclear 
power is diverse and bipartisan, it 
isn’t quite broad enough to enter 
mainstream 
political 
views. 
Parroting of outdated arguments 
has trapped many politicians 
in an echo chamber of nuclear 
neglect. 
Even 
presidential 
hopefuls are stuck in this fallacy. 

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren, 
D-Mass. 
and former Vice President Joe 
Biden all reject nuclear power 
as they confidently cite outdated 
evidence. The fact is that new 
technology in the industry 
makes nuclear power safer, 
cheaper and better for the 
environment than it was even a 
decade ago, and politicians need 
to wrap their heads around 
this change. The barriers to 
any significant deployment of 
nuclear energy aren’t technical 
or scientific, they’re purely 
political and social.
Some may argue against 
nuclear 
energy 
because 
of 
concerns about safety or cost-
effectiveness. To start, nuclear 
incidents have been few and 
far 
between. 
With 
17,000 
cumulative years of reactor 
operation 
worldwide, 
only 
three major incidents have 
occurred.
Yet in the radioactive wake of 
Fukushima, political skepticism 
of nuclear power heightened, 
and nuclear legislation became 
taboo. The nuclear industry 
is still rebuilding its public 

image after nearly a decade 
of political neglect. But new 
nuclear 
technologies 
have 
undeniably 
made 
nuclear 
power a safer option, and 
political 
perceptions 
are 
slowly shifting as well. Due 
to 
growing 
demands 
for 
carbon neutrality and national 
security, accompanied by safer 
technologies, politicians are 
slowly regaining confidence in 
nuclear power. To bolster the 
credibility of nuclear energy, 
future 
nuclear 
legislation 
must 
include 
these 
new 
technological 
advancements 
that address the perceived 
concerns 
regarding 
safety 
and efficiency. This requires 
significant 
investment 
in 
existing reactor designs that 
tout increased simplicity, and 
thus increased safety and cost-
effectiveness. 
If 
we’re 
serious 
about 
the significant reduction of 
carbon emissions, we have 
to be for the idea of nuclear 
power. If we’re serious about 
the maintenance of nuclear 
deterrence and international 
non-proliferation goals, we 
have to be for nuclear power. 
We need radical change and 
we need it now. Though green 
legislation is an extremely 
partisan 
issue, 
receiving 
almost 
no 
support 
from 
Republicans in Congress, the 
widespread political support 
for nuclear power makes it 
the ideal path forward for the 
U.S.
As a result of technological 
advances that boast increased 
safety 
and 
cost-effectiveness, 
nuclear power is now both 
economically and ecologically 
practical. 
Moreover, 
in 
this 
treacherous 
political 
climate, 
there’s no chance we can even 
begin to address our situation 
with partisan ideas. Nuclear 
power 
won’t 
single-handedly 
get us to carbon-neutrality by 
2050, but it’s a giant leap in the 
right direction. We need to stop 
dreaming of a political utopia 
and play the hand we were dealt. 
In order to successfully address 
the climate crisis in the U.S., we 
must swiftly enact legislation that 
significantly invests in the next 
generation of nuclear power.

It’s been nearly a year since 
“Broad City” concluded its run, 
leaving a hole in the heart of 
anyone who watched — especially 
for Comedy Central. The apparent 
heir to this is “Awkwafina Is Nora 
From Queens” which should fit 
in just fine, once it settles down. 
After Awkwafina’s recent string 
of success in high-profile films 
like “Crazy Rich Asians” and 
“Ocean’s 8,” and after becoming 
the first Asian-American woman 
to win a Golden Globe for Best 
Actress for her role in “The 
Farewell,” she now steps into 
what could be her hardest role 
yet: filling the shoes of both Abbi 
and Ilana.
It’s 
extremely 
difficult 
to 
judge a show based on its pilot, 
as that first episode serves 
as an introduction into the 
show’s 
universe 
rather 
than 
an actual episode of the show. 
But, in attempting to establish 
the 
various 
relationships 
and dynamics of “Nora From 
Queens,” 
the 
similarities 
to 
“Broad City” become unavoidable 
— and they really just make me 
wish I was watching “Broad City” 
instead. Rather than focusing on 
the relationship between friends 
in their twenties, it’s Awkwafina 
and her family. One thing that 
remains 
the 
same, 
however, 
is that it’s a comedy about an 
entertainingly 
oddball 
young 
woman trying to make meaning 
of her life as she works strange 

jobs, gets high and makes the 
most of living on a tight budget. 
Comparing the show to “Broad 
City” is not the issue at hand. 
After all, imitation is the highest 
form of flattery. Once you stop 
comparing them, however, the 
problems 
become 
apparent. 
The editing and fast pace are 
supposed to provide the show 
with a sort of comedic energy, 
but Nora’s storylines are almost 

too short to become invested 
in. Fans of Awkwafina will feel 
her personality and creativity 
through some goofy montages, 
but that isn’t enough to stop the 
show from burning out fast.
Nora lives with her widowed 
father, Wally (BD Wong, “Jurassic 
Park”), 
and 
her 
unfiltered 
grandma 
(Lori 
Tan 
Chinn, 
“Orange is the New Black”). After 
being mocked for her hoarder-

like messy room and made fun 
of by a neighboring teenager for 
still living at home, Nora decides 
it’s time to move out. She’s going 
to get a job, an apartment and live 
the life she set out to live a decade 
before … except, she’s not! After 
a predictable set of escalating 
twists, she ends up right back at 
home by the end of the episode. 
In all fairness, this first episode 
gives us a taste of what’s to come. 
Nora’s failure to show any sort of 
growth tells us that her family 
will play a major role in the series, 
making this an ensemble comedy.
The scenes with her family got 
the most laughs and present the 
most possibilities for humorous 
interactions, which is why I have 
a feeling the show will improve. 
The pilot relies on Awkwafina to 
carry all the comedic weight in 
far too many of the scenes. This is 
mostly a function of her character 
trying to be something she’s not 
— an adult — which results in 
the episode being something the 
show isn’t going to be — a show 
about her becoming an adult on 
the fly.
As I tried to make meaning 
out of the various roadblocks, 
in some instances literal ones, it 
became increasingly clear there 
was no meaning to make. Far too 
many storylines led to dead ends 
rather than open up possibilities 
for Nora’s character. “Awkwafina 
Is Nora From Queens” should 
be able to find its footing, escape 
the similarities to “Broad City” 
and hopefully find its own path 
forward, but it’s going to take 
Nora much longer than it took 
Abbi and Ilana to grow up.

‘Norah from Queens’ sits 
in shadow of ‘Broad City’

COMEDY CENTRAL

JUSTIN POLLACK
Daily Arts Writer

Jane Hirshfield’s ninth book of 
poetry is an elegy to her lost sister 
and the world she used to live in, 
the world that had her sister in 
it. The collection was strangely 
uplifting, however; Hirshfield 
deals with the challenging topic 
of death by creating poetry that 
finds wonder in mundanity. 
In fact, her book isn’t really 
about death at all. Rather, it is 
the aftermath of death in her 
own mind, the way she deals not 
with the death itself but with the 
way it changed her worldview. In 
her poem “Vest,” she compares 
her memory to a “pocket holding 
the day / of digging a place for my 
sister’s ashes,” then comes to a 
realization of her own mortality 
in the next line when she writes, 
“the one holding the day / where 
someone will soon enough put 
my own.” Death doesn’t hang 
like a dark cloud over “Ledger.” 
Instead, it intertwines with life 
— in nature, in everyday objects, 
in the author’s own ponderings. 
Throughout the collection, the 
poems work together to create 
a unified philosophy of how life 
goes on after death: by taking 
nothing for granted, by finding 
beauty in the everyday and by 
contextualizing a life in terms of 
nature.

Despite grappling with these 
complex ideas throughout the 
collection, 
Hirshfield 
makes 
room to play with form and 
sound. For example, in the 
section of the book with similarly 
titled poems like “My Doubt” or 
“My Dignity,” the final poem 
is called “My Silence.” Calling 
this piece a “poem” proves that 

it has pushed the boundaries 
of the genre, because there are 
no words after the title — just 
blank space. It forces the reader 
to reckon with actual silence, 
rather than its idea distilled 
into 
verse. 
Hirshfield 
also 
includes two “assays,” which at 
first seems like a misspelling of 
“essay,” because these pieces are 

essentially mini-essays, written 
in prose and in a somewhat 
academic tone. In a play on words 
that would require a google 
search for most readers, the 
word “assay” means to examine 
something in order to assess its 
nature. One piece, then, serves 
as a play on words as well as 
an extension of the meaning of 
“poetry” by its very inclusion in 
this collection.
Hirshfield 
uses 
the 
dichotomous 
framework 
of 
something either “continuing” 
or “not continuing” to express 
everyday things we take for 
granted. In the poem “I Wanted 
to Be Surprised,” she writes, 
“What did not surprise enough: 
/ my daily expectation that 
anything would continue, / and 
then that so much did continue, 
when 
so 
much 
did 
not.” 
Implicitly, because of the context 
given by the rest of the collection, 
life is what “did not” continue 
for her sister; still, Hirshfield 
chooses to first highlight the 
remarkable 
fact 
that 
other 
things — most things — did. ‘The 
word keeps spinning’ is repeated 
to the point where the words 
lose their meaning. Hirshfield 
takes this concept and forces 
the reader to relearn it, writing, 
“I did not keep walking. / The 
day inside me, / legs and lungs, 
kept walking.” She separates 
her own experience from the 
rest of the world, sending them 
briefly on two separate tracks. In 

this way, her poetry produces a 
curious dissociative effect which 
demonstrates the walls trauma 
can erect in a person.
Environmentalism 
is 
characterized in this book not 
just as a grand and noble goal 
but a small, personal one as 
well. Nature is one of the ways 
the book deals with death — by 
placing it in a larger universal 
narrative of balance. She writes 
“Today, for some, a universe will 
vanish. / First noisily, / then 
just another silence” and then 
“Something else, in the scale of 
quickening things, / will replace 
it.” If the “universe” in these 
lines is a personal tragedy, she 
is reminding the reader — and 
to some extent, herself — that 
like “the glacier, / the species, 
the star,” things disappear. In 
relation to the existence of so 
many other things, that loss 
is relatively small and even 
expected.

The reconciliation of death 
and 
nature 
helps 
fuel 
the 
reverential 
environmentalism 
of the collection. Hirshfield 
establishes the link between the 
personal and the environmental 
early in the book, writing in 
the third poem, “I don’t know 
why I was surprised every 
time love started or ended” — a 
personal statement — followed 
immediately by “Or why each 
time a new fossil, Earth-like 
planet, or war” — a universal and 
environmental statement. By the 
end of the book, the mourning 
has moved from the personal 
to the global and perhaps to the 
political: “The facts were told 
not to speak / and were taken 
away. / The facts, surprised to be 
taken, were silent.” Hirshfield no 
longer simply grieves for the loss 
of someone in her own life — she 
grieves instead for the planet as a 
whole, condemning carelessness 
and ignorance in the face of 

ecological desperation.
Beautiful 
verse 
aside, 
several poems mention specific 
environmental 
concerns, 
like 
“freighters 
[that] 
carry 
their hold-held oil / back into 
unfractured ground” or “Fish 
vanished. 
Bees 
vanished 
… 
Arctic ice opened.” Hirshfield 
writes 
with 
a 
respect 
for 
nature and a moving plea for 
environmentalism that is all the 
more effective after the many-
pages-long 
emotional 
primer 
of her own personal loss. Now 
compared to the impending loss 
of the planet, the ecological 
grief feels personal, as she says, 
“Hands wanted more time, hands 
thought we had more time.” 
Hirshfield’s subtle handling of 
environmental issues, rendered 
in masterful verse, forces the 
reader to think of climate change 
in terms of personal loss, rather 
than as an abstract and distant 
problem.

When an orchestra finishes 
a musical performance, there’s 
usually a moment of silence and 
stillness. The musicians hoist 
their bows in the air, lift reeds 
and mouthpieces from lips and 
lift drumsticks off the kettles. The 
audience waits as the last note 
finishes rings through the hall 
before showering the ensemble 
with applause.
This scene did not occur Nov. 19 
of 2019. University Philharmonia 
Orchestra 
conductor 
Adrian 
Slywotzky’s 
right 
hand, 
suspended 
in 
midair 
after 
delivering the final cutoff, came 
crashing down onto his podium. 
His baton, enclosed around his 
fist, came to a halt atop the final 
pages — the barnstorming ending, 
if you will — of Dvorak’s Sixth 
Symphony, 
finely 
completed 
under his direction.
“I remember that moment, too, 
because I sort of surprised myself 
when I heard the stick hit the 
stand … ” Slywotzky said. “By the 
time you get to the end of a piece 
like that in a performance, you 
feel the weight, the substance of 
all the work that was done ... it’s a 
very triumphant moment.”
That moment, the polished 
performance 
which 
preceded 
it and a semester of seamless 
transition 
in 
the 
orchestra’s 
leadership, 
were 
statements 
Slywotzky 
— 
a 
first-year 
conductor at the U-M School of 
Music, Theatre and Dance on 
a one-year contract — made by 
letting his job performance do the 
talking.
But when he sat down to do 
some actual talking, he struggled 
to isolate his modus operandi. 
It took 20 minutes before it 
crystallized into words, though 
it’s apparent to anyone who 
watches him conduct a single 
measure. 
Slywotzky 
revolves 
around his love of the music and 
doing it justice. In an industry full 
of musicians with personal and 
political extracurriculars on their 
agendas, that is a beautiful thing.
***
Adrian Slywotzky played violin 
seriously growing up, but entered 
Yale University thinking he would 
wind up in a career that musicians 
call “something else.” Four years 
later, he graduated with a B.A. in 

architecture, but not all had gone 
according to that plan.
“Late in the game (I) made the 
decision to go into music instead,” 
Slywotzky said. “Getting my 
master’s in violin performance ... 
that was a very long transition.”
A 
mainstay 
during 
this 
transition was Yale University 
professor of violin Kyung Yu, who 
taught Slywotzky throughout his 
time as a Yale undergraduate.
“The fact that Kyung was ... 
able to support me and my violin 
playing ... during a time when 
I didn’t think I was going into 
music professionally was crucial 
for me,” Slywotzky said.
His introduction to conducting 
was gradual as well, beginning 
as an assistant of a student-run 
ensemble. Slywotzky’s interest in 
conducting turned into a passion, 
and after a trio of graduate 
degrees — master’s degrees in 
violin performance and orchestral 
conducting at the Yale School of 
Music, and a terminal degree in 
the latter at U-M — Slywotzky 
boasted an extensive resume 
filled with study under the world’s 
finest teachers in both fields. 
Diplomas in hand, he returned to 
the Northeast and began racking 
up diverse work experience, be 
it in a prominent role with the 
nationally 
acclaimed 
Boston 
Youth Symphony Orchestras or 
leading a New Haven, CT-based 
series of contemporary music.
“The fundamental thing is 
the same for every orchestra — 
everyone wants to sound good, 
and the difference is how to help 
each orchestra get to essentially 
the same goal,” Slywotzky said. 
“We’re all on the same path.”
In 
his 
interim 
capacity, 
Slywotzky 
succeeds 
former 
School of Music, Theatre and 
Dance faculty member Oriol 
Sans, now in his first year as 
director of orchestral activities 
at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison. His are large shoes to 
fill.
“I have the highest admiration 
for (Oriol) ... I wanted to continue 
his work to the best of my ability,” 
Slywotzky 
said. 
“Naturally 
things are going to be different ... 
(but) it wasn’t my goal to change 
anything.”
Slywotzky’s expertise when 
dealing with the string section, 
informed by his many years of 
playing in ensembles as illustrious 
as the Tanglewood Music Center 
Orchestra, is evident at every 

rehearsal 
and 
performance. 
Through 
repertoire 
spanning 
from Classical to 20th Century, 
he worked diligently to create a 
unique sound true to the musical 
period and composer. 
Considering 
the 
group’s 
performance of Haydn symphony 
No. 99; written in the 1790s, 
Slywotzky elected to be faithful to 
the style in which it was originally 
played by doing away with any 
vibrato in the string sound. The 
process of weaning the strings 
from their vibrato, often used as 
a crutch to mask poor intonation, 
was tenuous, but ultimately a 
key ingredient for an authentic 
performance.
The 
freshman 
conductor 
made an administrative change 
invisible to audience members but 
instrumental to the growth of the 
violinists of the group: rotating 
the players all over the two violin 
sections.
“UPO players should have the 
experience of playing second 
violin and first violin and playing 
in the front and playing in the 
back,” Slywotzky said. “ ... we’re 
all going to have those seats in 
our professional lives, so why not 
learn them here?”
His repertoire choices are 
far from fan favorites, but his 
conviction in their value bled onto 
his musicians and their audience 
if the standing ovations by the 
latter are any indication.
“The Brahms Serenade (No. 1) 
... it’s just a piece I’ve admired for 
a long time ... I thought it would 
be a fun project for the orchestra,” 
Slywotzky said. “The Beethoven, 
I think the second symphony is a 
little bit underappreciated, partly 
because the third symphony made 
a huge splash and continues to be 
so influential ... (in the second 
symphony Beethoven) expanded 
the dramatic possibility of the 
symphony.”
When asked about his career 
trajectory 
after 
this 
year, 
Slywotzky was tight-lipped. 
“I’m very happy to be here, 
doing the best I can while I’m 
here,” he said. “It’s written 
somewhere in the stars.” 
Even with jobs in his field 
shrinking, 
he 
radiated 
no 
concern about the future — only 
satisfaction in his current work. 
What more could a school want 
out of a professor?

In the current rap arena, 
simplicity is key. Few people want 
to spend hours laboring over a 
heady underground release with a 
fine-tooth comb. The people want 
bangers, and they want them fast. 
The only way to keep up with the 
demand is to strip the songs down 
so only the essential elements 
remain. Those best equipped to 
dominate the current climate 
are those operating in the realm 
of “derivative rap.” That’s not to 
say they imitate other rappers 
in an effort to gain clout; these 
rappers are stripping rap songs to 
exactly what the people want, and 
somehow, they continue to keep 
them fresh and exciting. They’re 
quite literally changing the rap 
game as we know it.
In a match of Derivative Rap 
King of the Hill, the contestants 
include stalwarts like Playboi 
Carti and Westside Gunn and 
newcomers like Lil Keed and 

645AR. Carti and Gunn have been 
at it for years, with Carti starting 
in the mid 2010s and Gunn in the 
early 2000s (2004!). Keed, on the 
other hand, is just getting his start 
after sneaking his way into the 
arena around 2016 and gaining 
notoriety in 2019. Then there’s 
645AR, the absolute newcomer 
in this battle for supremacy, who 
entered the arena in 2019. Who 
will win? Who will fail? Who will 
come in off the top rope and turn 
heads? Stay tuned to find out.

After a mere couple of years 
of toiling under the surface and 
releasing 
countless 
songs 
on 
SoundCloud, joining forces with 
Atlanta’s Awful Records crew and 
later joining A$AP Mob, Carti is 
now a bonafide rap star and has 
shown no signs of slowing. The 
notably reclusive Atlanta rapper 
drops infrequently and at a whim, 
but when he does drop, he takes 
the world by storm with some of 
the simplest songs ever recorded. 
With Carti, the line between 
chorus and verse is blurred. In 
fact, it’s nonexistent most of the 
time. His choruses are his verses, 
and his verses are his choruses. 
Every song he makes is catchy, 
and he doesn’t really have much 
to say, often rotating through a 
set of a few lines and ad-libbing 
constantly. Carti even uses his 
voice as an instrument, rapping in 
various versions of a high-pitched 
yap and his now signature “baby” 
voice. He strips Atlanta-style 
trap music down to its simplest 
elements. Listen to “Magnolia,” 
“wokeuplikethis*” 
and 
Young

buoyant and playful, but most 
importantly, they’re infectious

listener to the diehard fan.
Playboi Carti is an absolute 
behemoth in the derivative rap 
game and will be difficult to take 
down.
Westside Gunn
Having recently signed a deal 
with Eminem’s Shady Records 
and a management deal with 
Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, Westside 
Gunn and his crew Griselda 
are poised for big things. The 
Buffalo, NY crew is known for 
making hardnose revivalist New 
York boom-bap and features two 
outstanding rappers in Conway 
the Machine and Benny the 
Butcher. However, Westside Gunn 
is the standout player. He takes the 
boom-bap sound where no rapper 
ever has. His song “The Cow” is 
a prime example of this. All the 
signifiers of boom-bap (gun talk, 
drug talk, slick talk and bizarre, 
esoteric references to things like 
professional wrestling and high 
fashion) are there, but that’s it. 
There is no fanfare to it. The music 
is barebones, and it’s capturing 
the attention of rap purists 
everywhere. On the surface, his 
songs sound like typical fare, but 
it becomes quickly apparent that 
they are anything but typical. The 
wordplay and lyricism is present, 
but it’s not as complex. He leans 
almost as heavily on ad-libs as 
Carti, but he’s tasteful about it, 
belting out a hearty “doot doot 
doot doot doot” every few lines. 
Gunn also doesn’t use typical song 
structure, depending more on his 
verses and flows than hooks.
Westside Gunn brings boom-bap 
music to its most primitive state. 
He’s an absolute wildcard, and 
that’s why he’s gaining notoriety 
across the scene.
Lil Keed
Who would’ve thought that 
Young Thug would already be 
the most influential artist of his 
generation? Me, that’s who. In his 
brief career, Thug has influenced 
countless rappers, but none have 

ascended to the same heights as 
Lil Keed has. In this proposed 
derivative rap world, Keed is 
certainly the most derivative, but 
he leans into it and fully commits. 
He takes the yelpy exuberance of 
Young Thug and forms his entire 
career around it. And just like 
Thug, Keed isn’t very invested 
in making normal trap music. 
Instead, he wants to make trap 
music that sounds good, and he 
does just that on his recent release 
Long Live Mexico. He uses more 
typical structures, but nothing 
about his delivery and flows are 
typical. On his standout track 
“HBS,” Keed does everything he 
can to challenge what it means to 
actually rap. His flows are bouncy 
and simple. They are perfect 
extensions to his beats, only 
breaking free to occasionally let 
out an autotune-drenched shriek. 
Even when Keed pushes his 
delivery to a lower register, he still 
sounds triumphant and outright 
overjoyed.
Lil Keed is happy to be here, 
but that doesn’t mean he’s not 
aiming for something more. As his 
career develops, it’ll be interesting 
to witness how he uses his 
unconventionality to his advantage.
645AR
645AR has literally appeared 
out of nowhere, but it’s a good 
thing he did. No other rapper is 
challenging rap as we know it like 
he is. He’s a pretty standard trap 
rapper, but with a twist: he raps 
almost exclusively with his pitch 
shifted to the heavens. His voice is 
so high-pitched that it’s difficult to 
discern what he’s rapping about. 
His style has been referred to by 
Twitter users as “Mickey Mouse 
rap,” a hard descriptor to beat. 
Songs like “I Want the Money” 
and “One Way” are normal trap 
songs delivered through a helium-
infused lense, but his most recent 
track, “4 Da Trap,” is where 
he really starts to shine. “4 Da 
Trap” is a sickly sweet trap tune 
about his roots and how he’s now 
created his own movement. As he 
raps, he pushes his voice to the 
limits of human hearing, and the 
internet is loving it.
645AR won’t be turning many 
heads now, but he’s just getting the 
Mickey Mouse trend started and 
could soon be a real force, or at the 
very least a critical influence for 
those to come.
The Fight
Sadly, there is no way to tell 
who the real winner of Derivative 
Rap King of the Hill will be. It’s 
all based on personal preference, 
but in the current arena, personal 
preference is changing by the 
minute. Currently, Playboi Carti 
is still dominating, but that could 
change at any moment. Any one 
of either Westside Gunn, Lil 
Keed, or 645AR could easily take 
the attention away from Carti, 
but that’s the great thing about 
the current scene — prominence 
changes so quickly, each rapper 
could get their chance in the 
spotlight.
Regardless, 
each 
rapper 
is going to continue to tinker 
and augment their respective 
sounds. Playboi Carti is going 
to 
continue 
to 
capture 
the 
attention of the masses with his 
accessible-yet-challenging 
trap 
experimentations. Westside Gunn 
is going to continue to appeal to 
old heads and new fans alike with 
his boom-bap redux style. Lil Keed 
is going to continue to publicly 
question what it means to actually 
rap. 645AR is going to continue to 
do whatever it is that he’s doing, 
and people are somehow going to 
dig it. Each rapper has the ability 
to create genre-altering music and 
is already showcasing that ability, 
so it’s only a matter of time until 
each artist is their own king of the 
hill that is derivative rap music.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
MUSIC NOTEBOOK

JIM WILSON
Daily Arts Writer

If an opera is a feature-length 
movie, Andy Shauf’s concept 
albums are short films, expertly 
crystallized images of one night, 
one character, one lost love or 
the beginnings of another. Neon 
Skyline, the follow-up album to 
2016’s The Party, displays Shauf’s 
skill for creating these carefully 
crafted vignettes of characters 
and their backstories within just 
11 songs. The songwriter has 
refined his storytelling abilities 
throughout his entire career, and 
this record is the very obvious 
fruit of that effort. Lines like “Why 
do I do the things I do / When I 
know I am losing you,” cut right 
to the core of the listener, building 
on one another to create a mood of 
reflection and self-interrogation.
Neon Skyline, much like The 
Party, focuses around a specific 
night and its context in memory, 
this time at the Skyline Diner in 
Parkdale, Toronto, instead of a 
house party. The narrators do 

not change or bump into each 
other like they do in The Party, 
but instead the album maintains 
a steady first-person perspective, 
as the speaker goes through a 
night at the diner with his best 
friend 
Charlie, 
reminiscing 
about 
his 
failed 
relationship 
with 
ex-girlfriend 
Judy 
and 

chatting with whoever comes in 
the door. The album reads like a 
diary entry, tunnelling through 
the narrator’s memories, good 
and bad, as one reminds him of 
another. Each character gets their 
own spotlight, but it always comes 
back to him, each image and line 
of dialogue leading him further 
into himself. 
For a record that centers around 

emotional discord and confusion 
so predominantly, being anchored 
in one location lends itself to 
deeper introspection. The listener 
can hear the door shut behind 
the narrator as he walks in, the 
metallic pop of the waitress, Rose, 
opening a can of beer for him, 
Charlie’s laugh as he stumbles in at 
midnight. It’s a cinematic universe 
held within the bubble of a diner’s 
neon lights and hazy incandescent 
memories. Shauf resourcefully 
revitalizes the familiar sounds of 
his previous discography — lilting 
clarinet, shuffling guitar, soft 
snares and the musician’s husky 
vocals — to create a 360-degree 
view of not only the diner in the 
middle of the night but every 
moment that has brought the 
narrator there in the first place. 
As he watches Rose smoke in 
“Clove Cigarette,” he comes to a 
realization, his emotions coming 
into focus at the same time: “You 
take some steps forward and some 
steps backward,” he sings, “And it 
just doesn’t matter cause I’m on 
track.”

‘M’ beats UCSB to go 3-1 on weekend

The final shot came barrelling 
in, but Heidi Ritner was never 
worried.
The senior goaltender had her 
defense in perfect position and 
the ball sailed harmlessly over 
the net. That strong defensive 
effort led the No. 7 Michigan 
water polo team (5-3) to a 7-6 
victory on Sunday against No. 9 
UC Santa Barbara (6-3) to close 
out the Michigan Invitational.
Playing 
their 
first 
games 
in front of home fans, the 
Wolverines opened up with an 
11-8 win against No. 21 Wagner 
(1-3), which they dominated from 
the start. The team struggled 
against No. 5 UCLA (8-1) and 
took a tough 12-4 loss before 
bouncing back with a 7-4 win 
against No. 11 Pacific (2-3). The 
final match of the day against 
the Gauchos, though, ended up 
being the most thrilling of the 
weekend. 
“That game had so many 
different things that symbolize 
what a championship match 
looks like,” Michigan coach Dr. 
Marcelo Leonardi said. 
The game kicked off with 
an influx of fouls and a lack of 
scoring. Each team took a power 
play but could not capitalize. It 
was not until halfway through 
the first quarter that junior 

attacker Maddie O’Reilly opened 
the scoring with her thirteenth 
goal of the year. She leads the 
team in points and has set the 
tone on offense. 
“We’ve tried to maximize her 
shot selection and she’s doing a 
great job,” Leonardi said. “She’s 
just naturally confident, which 
takes time, but I like her mindset 
when it comes to playing.”
Added O’Reilly: “I’m a junior 
now. I’m trying to be a leader as 
much as possible.”
Her confidence helped elevate 
the rest of the team in the 
second period. The Wolverines 
traded goals with UC Santa 
Barbara, but largely dominated 
the pace of play. Several players 
hit the crossbar and kept up 
the offensive pressure. Junior 
defender Emily Ritner buried a 
shot in the back of the net with a 
minute left to put the Wolverines 
up, 4-2, at the half.
Michigan was in control, but 
the game felt far from over. 
“I thought they were going 
to get opportunities to at least 
get back into it.” Leonardi said. 
“We had to be able to finish the 
game.” 
After Michigan made it 5-2 
with an early third quarter 
goal from Erin Neustrom, the 
Gauchos stormed back. They 
scored two goals within a minute 
to trim the deficit to 5-4 entering 
the fourth.

UC Santa Barbara tied it up 
just forty seconds into the final 
period. The Wolverines took 
back the lead with goals from 
junior defender Sophie Pontre 
and junior utility player Kathy 
Rogers. Michigan held a 7-5 
lead and looked on their way to 
an easy finish until a Gauchos 
goal with a minute remaining 
suddenly made it a one-goal 
game again. 
UC Santa Barbara loaded up 
for one final push to tie the game, 
but ultimately, the defense held. 
“(I was) just making sure 
everyone 
was 
calm 
and 
composed,” 
Ritner 
said. 
“Everyone knew we were going 
to walk out with the W.”
Ritner, who had eight saves on 
the day, led the strong defensive 
effort from her goal. She made 
some difficult saves early on to 
keep the game close and stood 
tall when it mattered most. 
“I have one of the best goalies 
in the country,” Leonardi said. 
“She makes this look easy.” 
In a game of ebbs and flows, 
the Wolverines were able to 
squeeze out a 7-6 victory. They 
now shift their focus to the 
Stanford 
Invitational 
next 
weekend. Having shaken off the 
early season rust, they are now 
beginning to find an identity. 
“(It starts with) our defense.” 
Leonardi said. “Our defense and 
our confidence.”

Big lineup helps unlock Varejão

It was almost too easy for 
Izabel Varejão.
The 
freshman 
center, 
defended by a Rutgers guard 
six 
inches 
shorter 
than 
her, received a pass from 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk in 
the post with her back to the 
basket. Without hesitating, she 
faked one direction, pivoted 
the other, and knocked down a 
turnaround jumper to put the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team up 20 en route to a 71-57 
win on Sunday.
But this mismatch didn’t 
come because the Wolverines 
ran a play that forced a guard 
to 
switch 
onto 
Varejão. 
Instead, it was a choice the 
Scarlet Knights made due to 
the lineup that Michigan had 
on the floor, which featured 
Varejão, sophomore forward 
Naz 
Hillmon 
and 
junior 
forward Hailey Brown — all 
players who typically play in 
the post.
“There were times when 
Izabel was defended by (a 
shorter guard), and we were 
able to post her up,” Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. “So really trying to take 
advantage of the mismatches 
that we’re gonna have if we go 
with that big lineup.”
When 
senior 
forward 
Kayla 
Robbins 
suffered 
a 
season-ending ACL injury last 
weekend 
against 
Nebraska, 
the Wolverines lost a key 
part of their most common 
lineup. Without a clear sixth 
player on the team who could 
step into Robbins’ spot on the 
wing, Barnes Arico looked 
to 
experiment 
with 
some 
different lineups. While the 
big lineup wasn’t used in the 
second half — Brown picked 
up her fourth foul just four 
minutes into the third quarter 
— it was arguably Michigan’s 
most effective group, giving 
Rutgers problems on both ends 
of the court.
While the Wolverines’ style 
of play changed significantly 
with this lineup, it was clear 
that they were comfortable in 

their new roles. Three-point 
shooting was more of a focus, 
as Brown moved from the post 
to the wing, giving Michigan 
the true deep threat that it had 
been lacking on the perimeter. 
The Scarlet Knights devoted 
much of their attention to 
Hillmon and Varejão in the 
paint, 
giving 
open 
3-point 
chances to Brown and senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson.
Defensively, the Wolverines 
switched to a zone, and their 
length down low allowed them 
to close out on shooters and 
prevent Rutgers from getting 
the ball to its bigs — often 
resulting in bad passes when 
it was attempted. Michigan 
forced five Scarlet Knights 
turnovers in the six minutes 
the three bigs were on the floor 
together.
Most 
importantly, 
this 
lineup 
allowed 
Varejão 
to 
get comfortable and stay on 
the floor. Varejão has shown 
flashes of high-quality play, 
but poor defense, foul trouble 
and 
decreased 
offensive 
production 
have 
kept 
her 
off the floor in Big Ten play. 
Sunday, she played 19 minutes 
— her most in almost a month.
The biggest change for her 
was the zone the Wolverines 
played for much of the game 
with her on the floor. Varejão 
has shown immense offensive 
talent at times, but recently, 
teams have gone after her on 
the defensive end, drawing 

fouls from her and forcing 
Barnes 
Arico 
to 
take 
her 
out before she can get into 
a rhythm. The zone took 
pressure off her defensively, 
limiting one-on-one matchups 
and keeping the ball on the 
perimeter.
“Most freshmen come in 
and don’t know how to defend, 
have never had to defend, don’t 
really know the toughness 
of what it takes to play in the 
Big Ten,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I think that’s what Izabel is 
learning now, how to be strong, 
how to be tough, how to be 
physical, and how to defend.”
Because she was able to 
stay on the court, Varejão had 
her best offensive game. She 
scored eight points — tied for 
her most since late November 
— and added two assists, both 
of which came on tough passes 
not typically seen from a 
center.
“She 
came 
in 
with 
a 
confident 
mindset, 
playing 
defense, 
getting 
her 
shots 
off,” Hillmon said. “(Varejão) 
is instant offense, honestly. 
She’s trying to work on the 
little things so she can stay 
on the court, like defense and 
rebounding, but she was really 
confident today.”
Barnes 
Arico 
identified 
Varejão as someone who would 
need to step up in Robbins’ 
absence. Sunday, she found a 
lineup that helped get the most 
out of her.

Michigan hockey’s summer of painting houses

By early April at the latest, 
the 
college 
hockey 
season 
wraps up for all teams. That 
leaves players with a break 
of around five months before 
starting up again.
Such a gap allows players 
to return home to visit their 
families. Plus, they can work 
to fine-tune individual aspects 
of their games to be better 
prepared come fall. 
But the summer break also 
gives the student athletes an 
opportunity to take up jobs 
they wouldn’t have time for 
during the strenuous season. 
Senior forward Nick Pastujov 
and his brother, junior forward 
Michael 
Pastujov, 
are 
two 
members 
of 
the 
Michigan 
hockey team who have taken 
advantage of that.
“They had a summer job and 
they were painting the houses,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. “I don’t know, I think that 
only lasted one summer. I don’t 
think they properly drew up the 
estimates very well, because 
they seemed to be getting a lot 
of work and I don’t know if they 
were making much money.”
It 
was 
the 
summer 
of 
2017, right after 
Nick’s freshman 
year and before 
his brother had 
suited 
up 
for 
the Wolverines. 
The 
two 
of 
them 
worked 
in 
Michigan 
for 
Student 
Painters. 
The 
company 
hires 
college 
students 
and 
gives 
them a chance to learn business 
management skills by letting 
them paint houses and handle 
related business logistics.
The 
Pastujovs’ 
youngest 
brother, Sasha, had already 
been playing hockey in the state 
at that time. So, sometimes, the 

older brothers painted things 
for Sasha’s teammates. Other 
times, they painted for some of 
their own friends.
The majority of their work 
was exterior, but the duo also 
painted the inside of Eric 
Nystrom’s 
house. 
Nystrom 
— a former NHL player and 
first-round pick — is similar 
to the brothers 
in that he, too, 
spent 
time 
with 
the 
U.S. 
National Team 
Development 
Program before 
four years with 
the Wolverines.
“That 
was 
cool 
spending 
time with him 
and painting his 
house,” 
Mike 
said. “It was fun.”
Nick 
employed 
other 
teammates for a few of the jobs. 
For instance, James Sanchez 
— who now plays for Arizona 
State after transferring from 
Michigan — joined the crew 
once. Another time, senior 
defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce 

helped Nick paint two decks in 
the scorching heat.
“Basically what I remember 
is that it was probably one of the 
hottest days of the summer,” 
Luce said. “And both Nick and I 
got pretty severely sunburned. 
I didn’t reapply sunscreen. But 
it was a fun time. He paid for 
my lunch. He gave me some 
benefits 
for 
working 
for 
him.”
Nick 
and 
Luce 
came 
across 
challenges that 
day. Normally, 
Nick 
would 
power 
wash 
a deck before 
repainting. 
But 
on 
this 
occasion, 
the prior paint had a sort of 
stickiness to it and wasn’t 
coming off with ease. So, the 
two had no choice but to roll 
up their sleeves, get down 
and scrape the old paint inch 
by inch under the sun. The 
struggles didn’t stop there. 
They also had to carefully tape 

multiple dowels near the deck’s 
railings before repainting. In 
short, it was an eventful day.
When it comes to hockey, 
there’s likely a dispute as to 
which of the Pastujov brothers 
is the better player. But when it 
comes to painting, there was no 
competition.
“I was probably quicker,” 
Nick said. “He 
got tired pretty 
fast.”
Added 
Mike: 
“Nick definitely 
takes 
more 
precision strokes 
and he uses a lot 
more tape than I 
do.”
A 
return 
to 
painting 
in 
the 
future 
is 
unlikely for the 
Wolverines. Mike mentioned 
that all the hours spent working 
outside made for a difficult 
summer, and Luce is on the 
same page.
“It was a pretty taxing job I 
would say for sure,” Luce said. 
“I don’t know if that’s in the 
future of my career.”

Offensive adjustments 
help Wolverines in win

After 
playing 
its 
first 
three games in the Michigan 
Invitational over the weekend, 
the No. 7 Michigan water polo 
team (5-3) thought it had made 
all the adjustments necessary 
for its offense to dominate in its 
final game against No. 9 UC Santa 
Barbara. 
The team went 2-1 in its earlier 
tournament contests, but its nail-
biting victory was fueled not by 
experience from earlier matches, 
but by mid-game adjustments and 
a stout defensive performance 
against the Gauchos. 
When the two teams played 
last weekend in California, the 
Wolverines were efficient in their 
power plays, but that efficiency 
fell flat in their second meeting. 
Michigan thought it could 
attack UC Santa Barbara with the 
same strategy. But it was wrong. 
“I’m sure that they went back, 
they watched film,” Michigan 
coach Dr. Marcelo Leonardi said. 
“They made their adjustments 
... we had to make in-game 
adjustments to counter their 
adjustments.”
In the first half, Leonardi 
opened up the lineup more — due 
to fatigue setting in after a long 
weekend invitational — rotating 
in more players at a time and going 
deeper into the roster. But as the 
game became closer and closer, 
Leonardi needed to tighten up the 
roster due to some mental lapses 
and personnel breakdowns. 
The 
adjustments, 
mainly 
offensive, 
allowed 
sophomore 
center Erin Neustrom to get 
better looks and draw more 
exclusions. 
“A lot of my game is how 
teammates get the ball into me,” 
Neustrom said. “We have been 
doing a great job of that this year 
and my position is just feeding off 
of them.”

The 
Wolverines 
needed 
offensive adjustments to beat a 
team for the second time in one 
week, but their overall defensive 
strategy remained the same.
“Our defense contained them,” 
Leonardi said. “You hold a team 
like that who I feel like is high 
octane. They play really fast. They 
are going to create a lot of scoring 
opportunities so kind of keep our 
defense in check.”
And a more productive offense 
allowed for the defense to shine 
and play one of their best games to 
date. Praised by her coach as “one 
of the best goalies in the country,” 
senior goaltender Heidi Ritner 
had eight saves and two steals. 
Once the defense locked in after a 
shaky start to the second half, the 
Gauchos’ offense fell flat, allowing 
the Wolverines to maintain their 
slim lead. 
“Ultimately you could look from 
the side of my bench,” Leonardi 
said. “The facial expressions of 
the athletes that we’re facing, you 
could tell that once we locked in 
defensively they really struggled 
to move the ball and create 
opportunities to score.”
Junior defenders Emily Ritner 
and Sofie Pontré also shined in the 
game. Ritner had the most difficult 
matchups of the game, guarding 
the team’s finisher. In addition 
to her strong defense, where she 
tallied one steal, she added two 
goals on offense. As the center 
defender, Pontré guards the best 
weapons and does all the team’s 
dirty work. Pontré scored one goal 
and added one steal defensively. 
“(Emily) really came out of her 
shell and really grew this game,” 
Heidi, her sister, said. “I’m super 
proud of her. She had some big 
blocks on defense and some big 
goals on offense so she really 
helped us with the W.”
Added Leonardi: “Those two 
positions, if you can lock people 
down and contain them, then 
that’s a win in itself.”

Simpson violated team policies, 
won’t travel, Juwan Howard says

The 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team has suspended 
senior 
point 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson for one game, coach 
Juwan Howard announced on 
Monday.
“While we are disappointed 
with what has transpired with 
Zavier, we know there are 
always lessons to learn and 
grow from,” Howard said in 
a statement. “We take these 
matters and consequences very 
seriously. Moving forward, we 
will continue to handle this 
matter appropriately within our 
program and basketball family.”
Simpson informed the team of 
his suspension via text message 
on Sunday night, according to 
senior center Jon Teske. He 
will not travel with the team to 
Lincoln.
While the exact cause of the 
suspension is currently unclear, 
it was labeled a “violation of 
team policy.” Brendan Quinn 
of The Athletic reported that it 
is related to a weekend traffic 
incident.

The Wolverines will now 
be without the nation’s assists 
leader when they travel to 
Nebraska on Tuesday night. 
The length of the suspension 
will be “re-evaluated” following 
Tuesday’s game, according to 
Howard.
Howard declined to share a 
timeline of events, noting it was 

going to be kept “in-house.”
Mired 
in 
the 
program’s 
longest losing streak since 2015, 
Michigan sits in sole possession 
of 12th place in the Big Ten 
standings. When the Wolverines 
attempt to right the ship on 
Tuesday, they will now be forced 
to do so without a player who’s 
given them at least 37 minutes in 
five of the last six games, leaving 

a major void in the rotation.
Beyond 
Simpson’s 
ball-
handling capabilities, Michigan 
is losing its loudest on-court 
voice. Simpson’s leadership has 
been lauded throughout his 
tenure in Ann Arbor and, most 
recently, Howard has made a 
habit of likening him to Tom 
Brady in that regard.
On Tuesday, the Wolverines 
will be tasked with filling the 
void. Howard, Teske and junior 
guard Eli Brooks all voiced 
a desire to take a collective 
approach in doing so.
Though 
Howard 
told 
reporters on Monday afternoon 
that he hasn’t selected a starting 
lineup replacement, sophomore 
guard David DeJulius seems 
to be the likeliest candidate to 
start in Simpson’s place against 
the Cornhuskers.
Tuesday’s 
game 
will 
be 
the first time the Wolverines’ 
starting backcourt does not 
include Simpson in more than 
two years. 
“(Simpson) was disappointed 
for many reasons,” Howard said. 
“Overall, he knows the team is 
going to miss him. He knows he 
let his teammates down.”

Suspension doesn’t spell season’s end
B

efore Monday, the 
circumstances of the 
Michigan men’s bas-
ketball team could probably be 
categorized as run-of-the-mill 
adversity. 
A star 
player goes 
down with 
an injury.
The team 
loses four 
straight 
games — its 
longest los-
ing streak 
since 2015 — 
and five of its 
last six. The 
star player comes back and suf-
fers another injury. A series of 
unfortunate events culminating 
into a bleak situation. And that’s 
all it was supposed to be.
Until senior guard Zavier 
Simpson was served with a sus-
pension.
While the details of the sus-
pension are still unclear and 
coach Juwan Howard is keeping 
the details in-house, Simpson 
will be sitting out Tuesday’s 
game at Nebraska. The Wol-
verines’ identity is crumbling 
before their very eyes, they’re 
seemingly losing their compo-
sure and everyone and their 
mother is throwing out the 
word crossroads.
The question now becomes 
whether or not to slam on the 
panic button as quickly as pos-
sible or take a more measured 
approach to the whole affair. 
Since sports fanatics are 
famously known for making 
long, drawn-out decisions on 
how to feel about a given situ-
ation, I’m sure the public reac-
tion will be more reprehensive, 
akin to simply saying, “Well, 
that sucks.”
Except it’s not. Everyone’s 
going to be screaming and 
Tuesday’s game in Lincoln will 
serve as a complete and utter 
indictment on the team and its 

postseason hopes.
Win and your hopes are alive. 
Lose and you’ve booked a one-
way ticket to the NIT. 
Granted, with a healthy ros-
ter and no self-inflicted wounds, 
the Wolverines trounce Nebras-
ka. With the Cornhuskers 
sitting comfortably in the base-
ment of the Big Ten and ranked 
131st on KenPom.com, Michigan 
has the talent and experience to 
get the job done nine times out 
of 10. 
This game shouldn’t be a 
question.
But the fact that it is now 
doesn’t mean the team is 
cooked. There is a monsoon 
of factors working against the 
Wolverines. Perhaps things 
should be taken day-by-day. 
Take it from Howard himself.
“We’re not drowning in our 
own tears or drowning in a 
lake,” Howard said. “It’s not 
the end of the world. The mood 
of our team is we’re solution-
based. We’re gonna roll up our 
sleeves, figure out how we can 
get better as a group and guys 
are in the gym working hard, 
and they had a great practice 
yesterday, and we expect to have 
a better practice today to prep 
for Nebraska.”
Sophomore guard David 
DeJulius — expected to be the 
starter in Simpson’s wake — 
could very well step up and 
prove to be as effectual as the 
missing leader. After all, it was 
in Simpson’s sophomore cam-
paign that he emerged as the de-
facto leader of his squad.
Simpson could come back 
stronger than ever, having used 
the suspension as a lesson and 
ready to lead his team from the 
bottom to the brink.
DeJulius has shown flashes 
this season and could be a 
perfectly apt placeholder for 
Simpson, averaging 7.7 points 
per game and a much-improved 
player efficiency rating of 14.3. 
Look as far back as the game 

against North Carolina when 
Simpson went out in foul trouble 
— DeJulius stepped up and 
led the Wolverines on a game-
deciding run.
“Dave knows how to get to his 
spots and make shots, and that’s 
something that he does really 
well,” junior guard Eli Brooks 
said after mentioning the game 
against the Tar Heels. “So I just 
try to help him with being able 
to lead the team and getting 
people in the right spots.”
Currently, there are too many 
unknowns to make a definitive 
statement about this season, so 
don’t believe anyone who would 
tell you otherwise.
What is known, though, is 
that Simpson made a mistake, is 
being punished and will show 
the world what kind of person 
he is in his response over the 
coming weeks.
But in the meantime, treat 
the 2019-2020 basketball sea-
son as Howard is treating this 
suspension — witness its events 
day-by-day and reevaluate after 
Nebraska.
Freaking out over a late-Jan-
uary game in a season in which 
Duke lost at home to Stephen F. 
Austin, the Big Ten seems com-
mitted to not having a single 
one of its teams enter the NCAA 
Tournament and college bas-
ketball’s best player is sitting 
out solely to spite the NCAA is a 
fool’s errand.
Look at this game for what it 
is on paper — one of the confer-
ence’s worst teams attempting 
to steal a win from a sorely 
short-staffed, high-potential 
team.
Because if everyone comes 
back healthy and educated, a 
road game against the Corn-
huskers may look more and 
more like a low point rather 
than a crossroads.
