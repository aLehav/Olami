Three-percent 

increase expected 
due to higher cost of 

living, ‘U’ says

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
Residential 
Halls 

Association announced Tuesday 
that student housing fees at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
will 

increase by 3 percent next year.

The 
average 
on 
campus 

residence hall will cost about 
$10,870, 
according 
to 
the 

University. Housing costs for the 
2015-2016 school year averaged 
$10,554. The increase is one 
percent more than the average 
University housing rate increase 
each year, which has been 2 
percent every year since 2003.

RHA hosted a presentation 

Tuesday for students to discuss 
their approval of the increased 
housing 
fees, 
noting 
that 

housing fees pay for a variety 

of essentials but also help fund 
dorm renovations, as part of the 
Residential Life Initiatives.

According 
to 
presenters, 

compared to other Big Ten schools’ 
housing fees the University ranked 
sixth most expensive both this past 
year and for the projected future.

Ohio State University, Rutgers 

University 
and 
Northwestern 

University 
each 
had 
more 

expensive housing fees than the 
University, with Northwestern’s 
projected housing rate topping 
out at $15,412 for the 2016-2017 
academic year.

RHA adviser Beth Radecki, who 

is also South Quad Residence Hall’s 
Director, said she attended the 
discussion because she wanted to 
see the results of the organization’s 
work on behalf of the students they 
represent.

“Housing rates typically don’t 

stay the same from year to year,” 
Radecki said. “I think they did a 
great job explaining where we fall 
within the different institutions 
and 
also 
talking 
about 
the 

reasoning, how we ended up there, 
too.”

During fireside 

chat, students raise 

concerns with 

resources on campus

By LUCAS MAIMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

A new mental health clinic 

at the University of Michigan 
may be in the works, University 

of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel told students at a 
fireside chat on Tuesday.

“We are working on ways to 

potentially open up a mental 
health clinic for students with 
very 
serious 
psychological 

and 
psychiatric 
disorders 

that would be within walking 
distance of the campus and 
that would be able to provide 
ongoing medical, psychological 
and 
psychiatric 
support,” 

Schlissel said.

Schlissel’s 
remarks 
come 

in light of several speak outs, 
most 
recently 
on 
Monday, 

aimed at addressing issues 
of mental health on campus. 
The University also hosted 
a 
Twitter 
chat 
on 
Friday 

featuring Depression Center 
Director John Greden and 
other University officials to 
discuss 
mental 
health 
and 

sexual misconduct.

Improving 
Counseling 

and 
Psychological 
Services 

and 
overall 
mental 
health 

at the University dominated 
conversation 
during 
the 

fireside chat, which also was 
also attended by E. Royster 
Harper, Vice President for 
Student Life. 

Students present at the chat 

expressed multiple concerns 
about the availability of mental 
health services on campus. LSA 
senior Marlee Beckering said 
there is a lack of accessibility

Charlton talks 
tenure while 

Schafer looks to 

body’s future

By TIM COHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Tuesday, newMICH members 

LSA juniors David Schafer and 
Micah Griggs were sworn in as 
president and vice president of 
Central Student Government, 
marking the end of LSA senior 
Cooper Charlton’s and LSA 
junior Steven Halperin’s terms 
in office.

The Make Michigan party 

ticket was elected in late March 
2015 by a margin of only five 
votes, defeating The Team’s 
ticket of then-LSA junior Will 
Royster and LSA sophomore 
Matt Fidel.

The party ran on a campaign 

platform that included a number 
of initiatives to improve campus 
safety, 
such 
as 
introducing 

new 
safety-focused 
mobile 

applications and installing more 

off-campus 
street 
lighting. 

Additionally, Make Michigan 
advocated increasing diversity 
on campus by revamping the 
course certification process for 
Race & Ethnicity requirements, 
improving 
diversity 
and 

inclusion 
training 
and 

connecting admissions offers 
with financial aid packages, as 
well as implementing a school-
wide honor code.

Throughout Charlton’s tenure 

as CSG president, some of these 
goals were challenged by the 
University administration and, 
in the case of the street lighting, 
the city of Ann Arbor.

In 
an 
April 
interview, 

Charlton said the goals often had 
to be redefined to address issues 
of relevance to the student body.

Ultimately, 
many 
of 
the 

CSG resolutions and actions 
implemented 
throughout 
the 

year were in areas not heavily 
emphasized by the Charlton 
and 
Halperin 
ticket 
during 

their campaign. Over the past 
year, CSG pushed for policies 
like renewed student access to 
course evaluation data, early

Five University of Michigan

emergency blue light phones 
located throughout campus. As 
of Tuesday, 233 students have

The petition was created on

SO CLOSE YET SO FAR.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Students at the University 

of Michigan took to Twitter in 
observance of Equal Pay Day Tuesday. 
The national event began in 1996 
to bring awareness to the unequal 
pay women receive throughout the 
country.

In a Tweet Tuesday, College 

Democrats explained the event is held 
in April because that’s how long it 
takes women in this country to make 
the same salary men made the year 
prior.

A tweet from @UmichStudents 

echoed that sentiment.

Despite the passing of the Equal 

Pay Act in 1955, which required equal 
pay for comparable work, women are 
still paid about 77-79 cents for every 
dollar a man makes, according to 
CNN, Pew Research and Fortune. LSA 
freshman Will Kutler was one of the 
students to express his frustrations 
with society’s inability to create an 
equal environment on Twitter.

“Shouldn’t take my sister more 

than 3 additional months to make 
what I do in a year,” Kutler tweeted.

Many supporters of equal pay 

currently advocate for the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, which would give strong 
incentives —like legal implications 

for gender differences in pay— for 
employers to adhere to the Equal Pay 
Act. 

Some students emphasized the 

need to improve equal pay between 
genders, but also between races.

Beyond the University, the day 

was heavily recognized by national 
figures like Madeleine Albright, the 
first woman to become the secretary 
of state, emphasized the need to 
keep working for equal pay in the 
workforce.

“I’ll celebrate when we no longer 

need an #EqualPayDay,” she said. 
“Until then, we must all keep fighting 
to close the gap.”

City of Ann Arbor closes road 
ahead of events for SpringFest

North University will 

be closed between 
Fletcher and Thayer 

Wednesday 

By LYDIA BARRY

Daily Staff Reporter

With SpringFest slated to take 

place at the University of Michigan 
Wednesday, a series of road 
closures approved by the city of 
Ann Arbor will go into effect early 
Wednesday morning.

SpringFest, which is hosted by 

MUSIC Matters, is an annual event 
that features activities around 
innovation, art and music. The 
event will be located on both North 
University Avenue and the Diag.

As a part of the festivities, North 

University Avenue between Thayer 
Street and Fletcher Street will 
be closed all of Wednesday, April 
13. Additionally, event planners 

expect large crowds will be drawn 
to the closing concert featuring 
headliner Migos, which will occur 
at 8 p.m. in Hill Auditorium, 
potentially causing traffic issues 
for local residents.

City 
Councilmember 
Kirk 

Westphal (D–Ward 2), an urban 
planner by trade, saud despite 
closures, 
events 
are 
typically 

welcomed by local residents. 

“Most folks I interact with really 

value all the cultural events going 
on in Ann Arbor, and street fairs 
and events certainly have a role in 
that,” Westphal said. “The beauty 
of events that happen downtown 
is that typically since we have a 
street grid that doesn’t cause more 
inconveniences than benefits. So 
whether it’s University or a private 
organization, historically council 
has 
welcomed 
limited 
street 

closures”

City Communications Specialist 

Robert Kellar said University 
street closures can occasionally 
prompt local resident complaints 

due to the nature of the events, 
but University events specifically 
do not generate a large number of 
complaints throughout the year.

“University 
events 
tend 
to 

generate few complaints as they 
impact mainly those near campus,” 
Kellar said. “Most concerns are 
about 
access, 
inconvenience, 

timing or notification. We try to 
be proactive by asking applicants 
to submit a communication plan; 
we also utilize the city e-mail 
notifications as well as social 
media, and directing residents/
businesses to signing up on the 
street closure website so they are 
aware in advance of closures.”

If local residents have concerns 

or complaints about the traffic 
surrounding University related 
outdoor events, they can share 
them 
on 
the 
city’s 
Traffic 

Complaint page.

LSA freshman Kayla Fong teaches Rackham student Yi Niu how to do CPR as part of the American Red Cross CPR 
promotion event held on Central Campus Tuesday.
Club Sports teaches hands-only 
CPR to students walking to class

Organizers hope 
education can help 

reduce cardiac 
arrest death rate

By CHETALI JAIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Monday and Tuesday outside 

of East and West Halls, U-M 
Club Sports partnered with 
SaveMiHeart to train hundreds 
of 
students 
in 
performing 

hands-only CPR.

Club Sports and SaveMiHeart 

collaborated 
with 
American 

Heart 
Association, 
UM 

Emergency Medicine, Huron 
Valley 
Ambulance 
and 

American Red Cross to put on 
the event, which aimed to raise 
awareness about cardiac arrest 
and to prepare people for these 
emergency situations.

Each day, anywhere from 

five to 12 instructors stood 
beside the practice mannequins 
and 
automated 
external 

defibrillators, ready to train the 
students who were passing by. 
Stephen Dowker, LSA junior and 

SaveMiHeart member, helped 
to both organize the event 
and teach hands-only CPR to 
students.

“We are trying to empower 

people to act in situations where 
cardiac arrest occurs,” Dowker 
said. “The primary goal of 
SaveMiHeart as a nonprofit is to 
double cardiac arrest survival in 
Michigan by the year 2020.”

Robert 
Neumar, 
chair 

of 
emergency 
medicine 
at 

the University of Michigan, 
attended the event to lend his 
support. He said when cardiac 
arrest occurs outside of the 
hospital, the system of care is 
what determines if a person will 
survive or not, and less than one 
out of 10 people who go through 
cardiac 
arrest 
outside 
the 

hospital will survive.

“One of the most important 

things in a patient’s treatment 
is what bystanders can do,” 
Neumar said. “Bystander CPR 
and AED can double a person’s 
chance of surviving.”

Students were trained in 

hands-only CPR in about five 
minutes. 
LSA 
sophomore 

Musaab 
Muhammad 
was 

walking 
back 
to 
his 
dorm 

when instructors at the event 
encouraged him to get trained.

“I’ve never done CPR before, 

and I think it’s a valuable 
skill 
to 
learn,” 
Muhammad 

said. “I feel prepared, and I’m 
happy someone was there to 
actually point out the specific 
techniques.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Charlie Rogers was certified in 
CPR a few years ago and felt the 
event helped refresh his skills.

“This was really great because 

some of the specifics of CPR like 
push down two inches into the 
chest, how you should place your 
hands and the specific steps of 
the AED were just kind of foggy 
so it was a great refresher,” 
Rogers said. “Beginners caught 
on really fast. I think the 
no-breaths thing really helps a 
lot.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Michelle 

Baum said she hadn’t done CPR 
since taking a babysitting class 
in fourth grade. Baum said she 
felt her technique was improved 
and felt the event was helpful.

“I think (a) really important 

thing they are doing is making 
people feel comfortable acting

“

In addition to approving the 

housing fee increase to $10,870, 
the RHA also discussed other 
proposals for next year, including 
upgraded 
drinking 
fountains 

with water bottle fillers and 
extended Java Blu hours when 
dining halls are closed.

RHA 
President 
Lennox 

Ramsey, 
an 
Engineering 

sophomore, said proposals they’ve 
gotten approved by University 
Housing thus far include shifted 
weekend dining hall hours and 
new lobby access for students not 
living in residential halls.

“(Students) can eat earlier in 

the morning, the lobby areas of 
other halls are going to open up 
— you won’t have to wait outside 
anymore,” he said.

Ramsey said though he was 

confident the housing price hike 
is needed due to a heightened 
cost of living and operating 
costs, discussions like Tuesday’s 
were important to give more 
context to students who might 
face financial pressure from the 
change.

in a situation if it did happen,” 
Baum said.

This is the event’s first year, 

and organizers said they hope to 
make it an annual occurrence. 
Wes Vear, LSA senior and 
president of the Club Sports 
Council, said CPR is an easy 
skill to learn, and training 
more people could help raise 

Michigan’s 
8-percent 
pre-

hospital cardiac arrest survival 
rate.

Neumar agreed with Vear 

and said he hopes this event 
will create more promising 
statistics.

“Our mission here is to raise 

awareness of CPR and get as 
many people trained as we can 
in order to save more lives,” he 
said. “Anybody should be able to 
save a life.”

experience they discuss most 
often is their undergraduate 
research experience. Research 
is an opportunity to develop

who work with undergraduate 
students through the UROP

LSA 
sophomore 
Julia 

Kropa, one of the students 
who 
presented, 
discussed 

work on the Tel Kedesh 
Publication Project in which 
she is preparing a manuscript 
looking at the findings from 
the archaeological excavation 
of Tel Kedesh, Israel. The site 
featured more than 2,000 
clay sealings, which were 
used by public officials to 
mark documents and featured 
artistic 
representations 
of 

different mythological figures 
or other symbols or animals.

Kropa’s 
work 
centered 

on organizing the images of 
the sealings online in a more 
accessible format. She said 
this process is key to aiding 
future researchers in better 
understanding her field.

“The 
information 
that 

it 
contains 
and 
that 
the 

manuscript 
will 
detail 
is 

really 
important 
to 
other 

archaeologists 
when 
they 

uncover other research on 
Hellenistic archives,” she said. 
“If these images are uploaded 
in a more accessible format 
it will widen the scope of the 
audience who will be able 
to access it and give other 
archeologists a better idea of 
how this information can be 
used.”

LSA junior Kathryn Zoller 

and LSA sophomore Emma 
Kinery also talked about their 
work, which focuses on the 
History of UM Museums and 
Collections 
project. 
Kinery 

is also a news editor for The 
Michigan Daily.

The research details the 

history of the University’s 
museum system from 1837 to 
1900 and will be published in 
a book in 2017 as part of the 
bicentennial 
presentation, 

which funded their project. 
Zoller said recent contributions 
to the University’s museums 
demonstrate 
its 
continued 

prestige.

“The fact that we were 

given the Bristol mammoth 
— discovered by Jim Bristol 
this past year — is important 
because they still see us as 
a depository for important 
specimens,” she said. “These 
collections help improve the 
prestige 
of 
the 
University 

and the University is seen as 
important because of all of 
these collections.”

LSA junior Victoria Rai 

additionally 
discussed 
her 

research into the methods in 
transcriptional regulation of 
RNA, a step in the process cells 
use to make proteins in which 
DNA is copied to RNA. Rai 
has worked in with the Walter 
Lab in the Department of 
Chemistry since her freshman 
year. Her research aims to 
find ways to regulate the 
transcription process in order 
to combat diseases, which 
can occur due to errors in this 
stage.

She said her research is 

valuable for its ability to 
impact the lives of individuals 
suffering 
from 
genetic 

disorders.

“My research is important 

because there is a lot of genetic 
disorders — I have one myself 
— and it’s hard to deal with 
sometimes,” she said. “It shows 
that we are growing as a science 
community, and the ability 
to grow the technology and 
have these advances to impact 
people’s lives as a researcher is 
really valuable to me.”

to CAPS both online and 
on North Campus at the 
University.

In response, Schlissel said 

the University will continue 
to address these issues and to 
meet as many student needs 
as possible.

“We have to find the right 

level of staffing, a way to 
distribute this resource based 
on acuity of need, a way to 
assure that the wait is not 
beyond 
some 
reasonable 

length of time no matter what 
your problem is,” he said.

Schlissel 
also 
said 
the 

University 
will 
print 
the 

phone number for CAPS on 
the back of student ID cards 
beginning with next year’s 
incoming class and current 
students will receive a sticker 
with the phone number to 
place on their MCards.

During the event, students 

also 
asked 
Schlissel 
and 

Harper about ways to foster 
a relationship between the 
University and Detroit.

In 
response, 
Schlissel 

emphasized 
work 
already 

being done. 

“The 
University 
has 

increasingly been doing more 
projects with Detroit on an 
educational basis,” Schlissel 
said 
of 
Detroit. 
“Around 

1000 
undergraduates 
do 

year-long engaged learning 
and volunteer projects with 
communities in the city year 
after year.”

When asked to critique 

the ways schools within the 
University are connecting to 
Detroit, Schlissel said he did 
not have enough information 
to critique specifically what 
schools are not doing, but 
added that he knows with 
certainty many schools are 
taking initiative in Detroit.

“The Business School is 

involved in Detroit at multiple 
levels, as is the School of 
Social Work and the School 
of Education,” he said. “The 
School of Engineering leads 
a very active effort in Detroit 
high 
schools, 
specifically 

around 
robotics, 
and 
the 

Medical School is also doing 
work.”

Another 
area 
for 

improvement 
Schlissel 

addressed was working with 
deans 
in 
various 
schools 

and cultivating a sense of 
community, particularly for 
those 
who 
were 
recently 

appointed 
within 
the 

University. Nine out of the 
University’s 19 deans are 
currently new or the position 
is currently being filled. 

“There is still relatively 

new senior leadership and 
we’ve come up with new 
ideas and directions that we 
want to take the campus, so 
it’s actually nice to be able to 
hire and appoint deans who 
are in their skills and have 
interests aligned with the 
new things we want to do,” 
Schlissel said. “So there’s 
upsides and downsides to all 
that turnaround, but we are 
getting great people.”

Schlissel also touched on 

the new Munger residence 
halls for graduate students 
and 
students 
pursuing 

professional degrees, saying 
he hoped they would inspire 
intellectual 
interaction 

between students studying 
different disciplines. Munger 
residents 
complained 
in 

March 
about 
a 
change 

in their leases and about 
students of different fields 
being segregated within the 
hall. Several students raised 
concerns over recent changes 
in th ebuilding, which has 
prompted complaints in past 
months, which many students 
felt inhibited their ability 
to continue to live in the 
University’s newest residence 
hall.

In response, Schlissel cited 

logistical 
challenges 
with 

nine-month leases, noting the 
purpose of the program. 

“It’s specifically designed 

to have people from different 
disciplines 
live 
together,” 

Schlissel 
said. 
“I 
think 

putting people together in 
living circumstances allows 
them to come together in and 
outside the curriculum but a 
substantive way that might 
enhance whatever it is they’re 
pursuing.”

FIRESIDE

telephone receiver is removed

for the alert and the dispatch 
of an officer.

LSA 
sophomore 
Helen 

Joa, one of the five students, 
said the camera would be the 
most useful in identifying 
an attacker since sometimes 
a student who was attacked 
or harassed cannot provide 
a good description of the 
perpetrator.

“Once 
the 
camera 
is 

activated, we’re hoping that 
it will help take the pressure 
off from the person who 
was attacked to identify the 
attacker,” Joa said. “Crime 
alert (from DPSS) is a fairly 
good system … but the only 
downfall is that when you 
get to the description of the 
perpetrator, 
it’s 
something 

like ‘they are wearing a North 
Face jacket.’”

Joa added that the cameras 

would be important especially 
given the light of recent 
events such as the anti-Islam 
chalking on the Diag last 
month.

“People come to U of M to 

learn and study,” Joa said. 
“This should not have to be a 
topic of concern for them. So 
anything I can do as a fellow 
Wolverine to make someone 
else feel safer, I’m going to do 
it.”

The 
proposed 
camera, 

outlined in the petition, would 
be activated only when the 
student pushes the emergency 
button, to alleviate concerns 
about privacy.

In response to the petition, 

DPSS 
public 
information 

officer Diane Brown said there 
are 
currently 
discussions 

within the department about 
enhancing 
the 
blue 
light 

system. She added that in 
addition to installing cameras, 
DPSS has considered installing 
public announcement speakers 
on top of the blue light phones.

“We 
could 
broadcast 

outgoing 
messages 
to 
the 

community for emergencies,” 
Brown 
said. 
“There 
have 

been discussions and there 
continues to be discussions 
about 
putting 
cameras 
at 

strategic locations.”

Brown said one strategy 

for cameras on campus in 
general would be installing 
them where infrastructure, 

such as data lines and cyber 
optic lines, are already in 
place. However, she noted that 
most of the blue light phones 
are too far away from such 
infrastructure, 
meaning 
it 

may be difficult to install the 
camera on existing phones.

“It wouldn’t be just placing a 

camera on a top of a pedestal,” 
Brown 
said. 
“Some 
other 

infrastructure 
enhancement 

would have to be part of the 
project.”

She added that the cameras 

do not necessarily have to 
be part of the phone system 
given 
the 
infrastructure 

problem, adding that many 
crimes don’t occur where the 
phones are located. She noted 
that the most common form of 
crime is stealing unattended 
belongings 
at 
libraries 
or 

recreational centers, which 
aren’t near the lights.

“We 
simply 
don’t 
get 

that kind of reports (at the 
phones),” she said. “But there 
might 
be 
locations 
where 

adding 
the 
camera 
would 

help.”

Brown emphasized DPSS 

is 
always 
interested 
in 

enhancing safety and security 
for 
the 
students, 
pointing 

to several existing services 
from DPSS such as using text 
messages to report crimes.

“(Students) can send us a 

text message with specifics 
(of the crime),” Brown said. 
“It’s more consistent with 
the communication devices 
students tend to use regularly.”

LSA 
freshman 
William 

Waters, one of the 233 students 
who signed the petition, wrote 
in an e-mail that interview 
he was motivated to sign the 
petition because he believes 
feeling safe on campus is 
extremely important, adding 
that he felt there is a low 
number of blue light phones 
available on campus.

“I have friends that have 

discussed 
their 
concerns 

about walking home at night 
alone and have noted their 
specific concerns regarding 
the amount of blue lights 
available on campus,” Waters 
wrote. “When visiting other 
campuses, there are so many 
more lights and they’re more 
advanced 
with 
cameras. 

In 
residence 
halls, 
other 

campuses have one in each 
hallway on each floor, but U 
of M does not have a single 
blue light in any dorm to my 
knowledge.”

PETITION
From Page 1A

dining hall hours on game days 
to improve safety during student 
game day tailgating events and 
on St. Patrick’s Day, as well as a 
change to the Board of Regents 
bylaws to reintroduce a provision 
eliminated in 2011, Section VII, 
which would increase student 
voice in University affairs.

The issue of mental health also 

saw sustained attention from the 
assembly. Beginning with the 
class of 2020, all MCards will 
have the 24-hour Counseling and 
Psychological Services crisis line 
printed on the back, in part due 
to CSG advocacy. Another mental 
health 
resolution, 
which 
was 

co-sponsored by Schafer, would 
allocate $900 dollars to produce 
an informational video aimed to 
raise awareness about drug abuse 
on campus.

Many of the body’s actions 

required a reallocation of funds to 
implement the programs. Business 
senior Kevin Ziegler, who served 
as CSG treasurer, said he thought 
financially, the assembly did a good 
job.

“The 
CSG 
Fifth 
Assembly, 

executives 
and 
commission 

chairs also all did an excellent job 
of putting student fees to work, 
benefiting both current and future 
Wolverines,” Ziegler said.

Schafer cited several initiatives 

as strengths of the outgoing 
assembly, 
saying 
he 
thought 

Charlton and the body succeeded 
in advocating for students.

“From stressing the importance 

of 
student 
presence 
at 
the 

highest levels of our university’s 
administration to advocating for 
the release of course evaluations, 
Cooper and his administration 
constantly fought to expand the 
opportunities and enhance the 
voice of students,” Schafer said.

However, Schafer added that 

despite the progress made in areas 
like mental health awareness, 
course evaluations and early dining 
hall 
hours, 
CSG 
experienced 

difficulty putting their plans into 
action in many areas of concern for 
University students.

“Some of our initial work has 

been, and will continue to be, in the 
area of relationship-building with 
both University and city officials 
to achieve some of the goals of 
previous years that might remain 
unrealized,” Schafer said. “This 
involves sitting down and having 
conversations on how to, say, 
enhance off-campus safety.”

Campus Safety
Improving off-campus safety 

was 
one 
area 
where 
Make 

Michigan’s campaign plans lost 
momentum. One proposed remedy 
to off-campus safety concerns 
was the installation of more street 
lights. This idea was proposed by a 
previous administration following 
a lift on the moratorium on new city 
lighting in February 2014. The new 
lighting projects were proposed 
to include the areas of Hill Street, 
Oxford Road and Geddes Road.

Though this campaign promise 

was one that garnered widespread 
support, especially from students 
who live off campus, CSG was 
unable to make progress in this 
area.

Charlton cited the lack of 

cooperation between CSG and the 
city, and the overwhelming costs 
of light installation, as reasons the 
platform point went unfulfilled.

“Off-campus 
lighting 
was 

probably our most ambitious plan 
for this year, but what gave us the 
most hope was the lifting of the 
moratorium by the city on the 
expansion of street lighting so that 
we could have at least a conversation 
about expansion,” Charlton said. 
“But we ran into two issues: the 
first problem is that it can cost as 
much as $400,000 to $600,000 
per corridor for installation, so 
assessing the finances of the 
operation was a hurdle that we 
were unable to overcome. The 
other problem that we faced was 
with cooperation from the city. Ann 
Arbor city officials were not very 
open to collaboration, and I don’t 
think that our relationship with the 
city was nearly strong enough.”

CSG also made little headway 

in the past year on another 
campus safety proposal — the 
development of a campus-safety 
app. The assembly from the year 
before, under alum and former 
CSG President Bobby Dishell, 
launched several projects in this 
area, including SafeRide and Night 
Owl apps.

LSA 
sophomore 
Anushka 

Sarkar, the CSG chief programming 
officer, 
noted 
that 
Charlton’s 

administration 
did 
nonetheless 

address 
multiple 
campaign 

promises succesfully while in office

Sarkar 
was 
newMICH’s 

campaign 
manager 
and 
a 

member of Charlton’s Executive 
Committee. She emphasized CSG’s 
work on mental health issues in 
particular as an area of success this 
past year.

“The work that has been done 

over the past year is impressive 
— between the expansion of the 
Wolverine Support Network, the 
availability of course evaluation 
data and the Race & Ethnicity 
Requirement hearings that were 
held, Cooper, Steven and this 
administration have a lot to be 
proud of,” she said.

Campus Life
Objectives like the expansion of 

the Wolverine Support Network 
— a student-led mental health 
resource — and the implementation 
of the honor code were also all 
campaign platform points for 
Charlton and Halperin during the 
2015 CSG elections.

Last November, CSG proposals 

for the University’s Statement of 
Student Rights and Responsibilities 
were presented to the Student 
Relations Advisory Committee. 
Among the proposed changes to 
the rights and responsibilities 
statement 
was 
the 
proposed 

formalization of a student honor 
code.

The code was an area of 

particular importance to CSG this 
past year after the destruction 
of a ski lodge by members of the 
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity in 
January 2015. The proposal to 
introduce an honor code to the 
Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities was endorsed by 
both CSG and by SRAC chairman, 
Statistics Prof. Edward Rothman, 
who acknowledged the importance 
of building awareness about the 
causes of student misconduct.

Charlton said the proposal failed 

because of dilution by SRAC.

“SRAC was extremely out of 

touch with the student body, which 
left us fighting with them rather 
than working together,” Charlton 
said. “And because of this, the 
honor code that we brought into the 
process, by the time that it made it 
through the process, had essentially 
been disassembled, deconstructed 
into a shadow of what it once was. 
Therefore, it was no surprise that 
once the honor code was brought to 
President Schlissel, he was not able 
to approve it because it lost many of 
the key elements that were initially 
featured.”

Academics
Another 
area 
CSG 
heavily 

emphasized this past year was 
the strengthening of the Race 
& Ethnicity course certification 
process. 
Last 
November, 
CSG 

members heard from students 
about their concerns with the 
requirement.

In January, Angela Dillard, the 

associate dean for undergraduate 
education, and members of CSG 
conducted a review of the course 
certification 
process 
and 
the 

necessary requirements for course 
designation. 

Following the review, CSG Chief 

of Staff Sean Pitt, an LSA junior, 
called for Race & Ethnicity classes 
to be smaller in an effort facilitate 
more discussion and dialogue 
on sensitive issues, implement 
required 
Intergroup 
Relations 

training for GSIs teaching Race 
& Ethnicity classes and to create 
a support network similar to the 
Sweetland Writing Center for 
Race & Ethnicity classes.

One of CSG’s most contentious 

battles this year was over the 
publication of course evaluations 
for student course selections. 
When 
CSG 
faced 
opposition 

from the administration over 
the release of course evaluation 
data, CSG filed a Freedom of 
Information Act request. 

“Our 
biggest 
source 
of 

opposition for course evaluations 
came from the faculty,” Charlton 
said. 
“We 
didn’t 
want 
to 

simply tell the University, the 
professionals who are in charge 
of our education, to do what 
we want them to do. And there 
definitely were collisions and 
conflicts, but because we were 
honest with each other we were 
able to come to a compromise that 
will benefit students, and in time, 
the faculty too.” 

As a result of the FOIA 

request and the compromise 
made between CSG and the 
administration to not release 
course 
evaluations 
in 
their 

entirety, some course evaluation 
data will be available under the 
University’s stipulations for the 
fall 2016 semester with Provost 
Martha Pollack’s approval.

T

hey say you go away to college to 
learn about the world. To learn 
what makes the world spin, where 

your place is in it and how 
to someday change it for 
the better. So that’s what 
I did for the last four 
years.

I passed my classes, 

made 
connections 
and 

got a job — all of the 
things that are supposed 
to happen in college. I 
studied computer science 
and math. I lived in 
this STEM world where 
programming 
was 
the 

future and the world was seen as one big 
beautiful mathematical model.

I liked what I studied. I liked thinking 

in numbers and algorithms. I liked being 
faced with a problem and moving toward 
a solution using the toolsets I had learned. 
Problem solving was the epitome of the 
engineering mindset, and it made sense to 
see the world around me in the same way. 
Observe a problem that’s out there, find 
a way to creatively work through it, then 
move on to the next one.

It’s usually the way things work in 

college, where you find what you enjoy 
and immerse yourself in that paradigm. 
At one point during 
my time here, I had 
the opportunity to talk 
with a visiting priest at 
my parish, who along 
with his ordained role 
was a math professor 
at Xavier University. 
Clearly 
very 
smart 

and passionate about 
his work, he chatted 
with a group of us 
undergraduates 
about 

the way mathematics 
fits into his life and 
his worldview. He said that there was one 
question that every person always asks him. 
 
 
 
 
 

“Do you see beauty in mathematics?”
He said of course there’s such a thing 

as mathematical beauty. Beauty in the 
way the numbers work out, beauty in 
things like Euler’s identity, beauty where 
you somehow combine the three basic 
arithmetic 
operations 
and 
the 
most 

important mathematical constants to 
somehow get e^i*pi = 0. But, what about if 
he actually sees beauty in the world itself 
through math?

He said no, he doesn’t.
Beauty in the numbers is only self-

contained. Numbers may be the governing 
model of the universe, but trying to 
describe the world around us in terms 
of numerics comes up empty and misses 
too much. The world was also meant 
to be described in ways that aren’t 
quantifiable or measurable. It was meant 
to be described with things that you 
can’t reduce into numbers or systems but 
nevertheless exist all around us.

The world was meant to be described as 

a story.

I 
spent 
Spring 
Break 
this 
year 

backpacking and traveling southern Utah, 
and found myself on the last night of the 
trip with a couple friends at a blackjack 
table in Las Vegas before we flew out 
the next day. At its core, gambling is just 
math designed not to be in your favor. So 
we played the odds that night, trying to 
stay afloat just long enough to get our free 
drinks and move on to see the next place 
on the strip. I learned how to count cards 
from a class here at the University, but I 
wasn’t there for the math. I was there to 
share stories and to write new ones.

Looking at the world through stories 

led me here, to the newsroom at the Daily. 
I started as an Editorial Board member, 
served as an editor in the opinion section 
for a time, and then had my own space 
here on this page. There was a time I 
was the only engineering student in the 
opinion section, but there was always 
something 
far 
more 
beautiful 
about 

words and print to me than the numbers I 
surrounded myself with in the classroom. 
So I read stories, I edited them and, most 
importantly, I wrote them.

I had a place to tell inconsequential 

stories, such as the time a squirrel fell 
out of a tree onto my head on the Diag 
one day. I told stories about the campus 
I loved and my hometown that I adored. 
When the Daily asked me to list a topic 

for my columns, I said “not 
politics.” So, I wrote about 
how much I hated politics. I 
wrote about the people who 
met the same misfortune as 
me sitting in the second floor 
of the library on a Friday 
night. I wrote stories about 
newspapers themselves, and 
stories about my high school 
teacher who passed away — 
the one who told me to start 
writing in the first place.

I wrote in a story one time 

about the phenomenon of 

spectators at a baseball game chasing after 
the balls hit into the stands. The souvenirs 
they make, from a price standpoint, are 
worthless, not even sellable on Amazon. 
Yet fans will chase after them with fervor 
and cheer for the lucky ones who can snag 
one. Over the years, I’ve caught a couple 
and lost all but one of them, but never the 
image of the ball falling into my hands 
each time. Just like the baseballs, I’ll leave 
after my years here with many “things,” 
whether it be skills or a diploma. But the 
things themselves become meaningless 
without the stories behind them.

So yes, I did indeed learn about the 

world here at college. I learned from the 
stories that came in and out of this paper 
and this newsroom, the stories I was a part 
of and the ones all around me. Stories have 
an ending, as does mine which ends with 
this, my last column after the years with 
this paper. Yet, there’s always another 
issue tomorrow, because the world always 
has its stories that need to be told.

riting is hard. Not only 
is the process grueling 
(I’ve had this Google 

doc 
open 
for 

an entire week 
with absolutely 
no 
progress 

made 
on

whatsoever), it 
is also risky.

Writing 
for 

a

means 
being 

vulnerable. 
It 

means believing 
your

is 
valid 
and 

informed enough to contribute 
to a dialogue. It means elevating 
yourself to a level at which you 
can be scrutinized. It is long 
nights of research, multiple tabs 
open, scouring the thesaurus for 
another way to say “political” or 
“good.” It is absolute hell.

But at the same time, writing 

is also rewarding. It is a platform

which 
you 
can 
reach 

hundreds, thousands, millions of 
people you will probably never

They could vehemently oppose

Daily, I was unsure of myself and 
my ability to connect with my 
readers. I truly believed that no 
one would find my line of thinking 
relatable enough to appreciate. 
I made my differences known. I 
never shied away from discussing 
heavy topics like class structure, 
politics and sex. I opened myself 

up to an anonymous audience and I 
was terrified of the consequences.

For me, the greatest of these fears 

was being brutally honest without 
actually 
conveying 
anything 

meaningful. I could have easily 
made people very uncomfortable 
while contributing nothing of 
value to any conversation. It was a 
balancing act.

My very first column, in which 

I recounted the events that rallied 
me to political activism, was 
originally part of my columnist 
application. I didn’t realize that it 
would actually be published before 
I had the chance to edit it, so when 
I saw it there on the website — 
my own name tacked onto a very 
passionate and personal piece of 
writing — my stomach dropped. I 
felt like a colossal segment of my 
soul had been extracted from my 
body and thrust into cyberspace 
for my peers to pick apart like 
vultures. There was nowhere for 
me to hide. I was exposed.

I 
imagined 
the 
flood 
of 

inflammatory e-mails denouncing 
me as too liberal, discrediting 
my background, correcting my 
grammar. I firmly believed that if 
people actually cared about what 
I had to say, they would hate it. I 
pined for indifference.

To my complete surprise (and 

contrary to what my paranoia led 
me to believe), the responses to my 
first article were overwhelmingly 
positive. While the compliments I 
received from friends and family 
made the effort worthwhile by 
themselves, it was the praise I 
received from complete strangers 
that really demonstrated to me 
just how powerful writing can 

be. This momentum only built 
over the course of the semester 
when people of all ages and 
backgrounds 
wrote 
to 
me, 

corroborating my words with 
their experiences.

I am not recounting any of 

this to brag about the quality 
of my writing (which I think 
is mediocre at best), and I 
imagine those people were not 
contacting 
me 
because 
they 

believed wholeheartedly I was 
the next Bob Woodward. I am 
just residually astounded that 
real people — people who will 
probably only ever exist as names 
in my inbox — have felt precisely 
what I have felt, seen what I have 
seen, done what I have done and 
believe that I captured aspects 
of their story in my own.

I cannot begin to describe how 

incredible that is.

That is what makes the hours 

spent writing and rewriting and 
rewriting the rewrites — to the 
point where the words swell 
and dance on the page and you 
wonder if they are even spelled 
correctly, or if they are even 
words anymore and not just 
figments of your imagination — all 
worthwhile. They are all worth 
the gratification of speaking to or 
for an audience.

Regardless of whether or not I 

continue to publish my writing, at 
least I can live the rest of my life 
with the knowledge that someone 
else, somewhere, can relate to the 
nonsensical thoughts in my head 
— and sometimes, that is enough.

“I wasn’t there for 

the math. I was 

there to share stories 

and to write new 

ones.”

I don’t spend most Saturdays 

around 
a 
lecture 
hall, 
but 

this past March, I made an 
exception. 
I 
had 
noticed 
a 

Facebook event for the Saturday 
Morning 
Physics 
talk 
series 

titled “Higgs and the Beginning 
of the Universe,” to be given by 
Bibhushan Shakya, a researcher 
here at the University. It piqued 
my curiosity. I couldn’t believe 
it when I arrived early and yet 
found the largest lecture hall in 
the Weiser building (formerly 
Dennison) full, and the overflow 
lecture hall next door, equally as 
large, full as well, a total of more 
than 500 people. Most in this 
crowd, it seemed, were beyond 
their student years. Apparently 
for many, Saturday Morning 
Physics is a weekend staple, and 
some have been attending since 
its inception in 1995.

Some of the facts about Higgs 

I already knew. The discovery of 
the Higgs Boson, as it’s called, 
was predicted by a physicist 
named Peter Higgs back in 1964. 
It was finally confirmed in 2012 
by the large team of scientists at 
the Large Hadron Collider near 
Geneva, 
Switzerland, 
where 

experiments are performed by 
smashing 
together 
particles, 

smaller than the size of atoms, 
at a speed that approaches the 
speed of light. At the time of 
the 
announcement, 
it 
made 

mainstream 
media 
headlines, 

dubbed 
as 
the 
“The 
God 

Particle.” Why the name? Many 
tiny Higgs Bosons, within the 
Higgs Field, impart the property 
of mass upon all objects in the 
universe, and the ability for them 
to interact through gravity. “The 
God Particle” is responsible for 
forming matter into galaxies, 
stars and the planet that has 
provided us with the exact 
necessities for life.

At this talk, I learned new 

things about Higgs, such as the 
answer to how the Higgs field 
gives matter its mass. Think 
of a shoreline where there are 
several different kinds of boats 
moving about. Some boats, like 
jet skis, barely skim across the 
surface of the water. Larger 

boats, maybe the size of a cruise 
ship, are actually substantially 
submerged 
underneath 
the 

water. As a consequence, the 
jet ski can move around more 
quickly than the cruise ship, but 
it wouldn’t be able to move as 
fast as, say, an airplane, which 
doesn’t need to touch the water 
at all. The amount of water they 
touch the water gives them 
different properties.

The 
same 
concept 
applies 

for Higgs. Some objects, like 
planets, which have a lot of 
matter, interact with the Higgs 
field more strongly than other 
objects, like snowflakes, that 
have relatively less matter. And 
like the airplane in the analogy, 
a photon, or particle of light, 
doesn’t even interact with the 
Higgs field, enabling it to travel 
at a much faster speed. The 
amount by which objects interact 
with the Higgs field determines 
how much mass they contain and 
how much gravitational force 
they have.

I 
commend 
Dr. 
Shakya; 

he’s built a career in studying 
theoretical 
physics, 
earning 

degrees at Stanford in physics 
and philosophy, and a Ph.D. 
from Cornell. As a graduate 
student 
studying 
biomedical 

engineering, I’m not unfamiliar 
with science, though theoretical 
particle physics doesn’t pertain 
much to my own field. His talk 
really challenged me, but it also 
fed my curiosity. I’ve found 
it fascinating to consider and 
discuss the big questions in 
science, and learning about “The 
God Particle” serves as food for 
thought.

I would imagine that many 

Michigan 
students 
have 
an 

intellectual 
curiosity 
about 

something unrelated to their 
own 
field. 
People 
shouldn’t 

be completely siloed in their 
one 
specific 
area 
of 
study. 

It’s important to find ways to 
address those other curiosities 
and to make them a priority. 
Learning about something that 
I’m genuinely curious about, 
especially when I don’t know 
much about it, can be truly 

gratifying.

I’ll conclude with my biggest 

takeaway thought from the talk. 
Higgs explains something as 
small as why objects fall when 
dropped, but also, on the cosmic 
scale, the makeup of the universe 
and why it is still expanding in 
size. It explains how it might 
eventually stop expanding, and 
that it might actually begin to 
contract back to its infinitesimal 
size at the time of the Big Bang, a 
theoretical phenomenon known 
as the Big Crunch. Assuming 
humans don’t succumb to climate 
change, to Earth’s engulfment 
by our expanding sun or some 
other, more immediate threat to 
our survival, preventing the Big 
Crunch might be the ultimate 
challenge for our species.

If that sounds grim, it luckily 

won’t become an issue for at 
least tens of billions of years. 
Yet, according to Forbes in 2012, 
from the contributions of several 
countries, $13.25 billion was 
spent to conduct experiments at 
the Large Hadron Collider that 
helped discover Higgs. Peter 
Woit, a theoretical physicist at 
Columbia University, wrote in 
a blog post that, while small in 
comparison to the expenditures 
on 
military 
and 
biomedical 

research in the United States, 
hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 

dollars are still spent by our 
own government and private 
foundations to fund theoretical 
physics research.

But 
why 
would 
these 

establishments provide funding 
for theoretical physics when 
climate change and other issues 
are far more imminent threats? 
I think it suggests that we, as 
humans, 
can 
be 
irrationally 

curious. Or maybe, preventing 
the end of the universe is a 
problem that really will take 
several billions of years to solve, 
and we can breathe a sigh of 
relief that we’ve already begun 
to consider it now.

BIRCOLL

T

here’s a very quick, subtle 
contrast in “Mad Max: 
Fury Road.” Throughout 

the film, we witness the brain-
washed, blindly devoted War 
Boys hurl 
themselves at 
danger with 
the expecta-
tion of dying 
a warrior’s 
death. Just 
before their 
demise, 
they all call 
out to their 
comrades, 
“Witness 
me!” and then give themselves 
to Valhalla, as they believe. But 
just before protagonist Imperator 
Furiosa kills the megalomaniacal 
despot Immortan Joe, she locks 
eyes with him and growls not 
“witness me,” but “remember me.”

Each time I’ve seen the film, 

this line has stuck out to me — 
remember me. On the one hand 
it’s an unusual phrase to utter to 
someone who is seconds away 
from death and will thereafter 
remember nothing. But on the 
other, it’s a very poignant declara-
tion of defiance, power and legacy. 
Something witnessed is fleeting, 
offering only a few moments of 
experience or emotion before van-
ishing. Something remembered 
carries weight; to be remembered 
is not to disappear.

Remembrance has been at the 

back of my mind, because at the 
end of this column I will, in all 
likelihood, never write about film 
again. It’s so strange to think that 
some 60-odd articles linked on 
a webpage will serve as the only 
markers of all of my effort, my 
time, my debates, my research, 
all of my studying devoted to the 
medium of film and all of its intri-
cacies. Some of those articles I like 
a great deal; in others, I squirm 
at my obvious shortcomings as a 
writer and critic. But they are my 
legacy as a film critic. Even more, 
they are proof that I was a film 
critic.

At the end of this page, I can 

no longer call myself a film critic, 
or even a writer. And despite my 
frequent bouts with writer’s block 
as of late, I cannot help but be 
saddened by that realization, for I 
know there’s more that I can say:

I never got to tell you how 

“Lost in Translation” so master-
fully captures emotion through 
a combination of image and 
soundtrack, how the guitar fuzz 
of My Bloody Valentine’s “Some-
times” mirrors the dreamy haze 
of a late-night drive through 
Tokyo. Nor was I able to write 
about Jeff Nichols’s incred-
ible film “Take Shelter,” how 
it thoughtfully and beautifully 
meditates on mental illness, sac-
rifice and family while also serv-
ing as a modern parable of the 
middle class American family liv-
ing in the wake of the economic 
crisis of 2008. I never got my 
geek on and went in-depth into 
my love of “Star Wars” and how I 
live by the words of Yoda: “Only 
what you take with you.”

I didn’t have time to find the 

release I’ve long sought by writ-
ing about my trips to the movie 
theater with my dad as he battled 
cancer in 2010. I couldn’t share 
how movies gave me heroes like 
Clint Eastwood and Harrison 
Ford to look up to, and how I 
grew stronger through them and 
the spirit they embody on-screen.

Many of those articles are 

saved on my computer, critical 
skeletons dancing in the limbo of 
Microsoft Office. I never found 
the right words to complete those 
thoughts, and I probably never 
will. So I can only hope that my 
body of work was enough.

I like to think it was. I like to 

think that my readership includ-
ed more than my parents, their 
Facebook friends, the Arts writ-
ers at The Michigan Daily and a 
couple crass, easily irritable Stone 
Temple Pilots fans. But in the 
end, writing was an activity for 
me and no one else. It was a pro-
cess to sort out my thoughts, to 
challenge myself with new ways 

of thinking about film, creativ-
ity, interpretation and criticism 
itself. That it must end is, simply, 
bittersweet. 

As a result, I’ve thought a lot 

about endings lately. How some 
films have the perfect endings — 
“The Usual Suspects,” “Field of 
Dreams,” “Apocalypse Now,” to 
name a few — and how others 
simply don’t know when to end. I 
think of the ending to “Lincoln,” 
which effectively strips the film 
of the subtlety imbued in its logi-
cal ending shot, a weary Lincoln 
leaving the White House to meet 
his wife at the Ford Theater, to 
give us a “proper” Hollywood 
biopic ending that martyrs the 
man. An ending like that isn’t 
actually an ending: it’s a gift-
wrapped manufacture that tries 
to spell everything out for the 
audience.

In a way I understand it, 

this desire for a well-packaged, 
digestible ending for audience 
and director alike. It’s hard to 
limit oneself, to willingly deprive 
oneself of making that one final 
point, the one that can tie it all 
together and make it pretty. It’s 
hard to know that to add more 
risks detracting from the work as 
a whole. It’s hard to simply walk 
away.

But the proper ending can 

really be the difference between 
jumping out of your seat to beat 
the rush of exiting moviegoers 
and needing to wait for the lights 
to come back on because you’re 
just too moved to rise. It can be 
the difference between good and 
great — between witnessing and 
remembering.

Which is why I leave it here: 

no grand overarching statements, 
no sentimental declarations, just 
an ending. I simply hope someone 
found my words worthwhile. 
Witness me. Remember me. It’s 
up to you.

M83 turns back 
clock with ‘Junk’

Techno-indie group 

channels ’80’s 

television romance

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

As both a musician and 

visual artist, M83 frontman 
Anthony Gonzalez makes his 
music sound as 
though it could 
be a movie or 
TV soundtrack. 
On 
2011’s 

acclaimed 
double-album 
Hurry Up, We’re 
Dreaming, 
Gonzalez 
demonstrated 
his 
love 
of 

Terrence Malik and Werner 
Herzog films by employing epic, 
stadium-ready jams to create the 
sensation of child-like wonder 
and innocence. His band’s latest 
record, Junk, draws inspiration 
from 1980s sitcoms, particularly 
“Punky Brewster” and “Who’s 
the Boss”. And judging from 
Junk’s wacky album cover, 
Gonzalez shows that he isn’t 
afraid to move M83 into new 
directions. 

Though slightly uneven in 

its execution, Junk is M83’s 
weirdest, most ambitious and 
most experimental work to 
date. Similar to how Daft Punk 
revitalized ’70s culture on their 
Grammy-winning 
comeback 

record 
Random 
Access 

Memories, Gonzalez cherishes 
the soul and spirit of the ‘80s 
on Junk, transforming old-
fashioned rhythms into modern 
pop songs. While appreciating 
a simpler time on American 
television, Junk also focuses on 

darker themes of existentialism 
and mortality. As Gonzalez 
stated in a press release, the 
album is about how everything 
we create will become “space 
junk,” 
a 
concept 
Gonzalez 

describes as both scary and 
fascinating. Junk certainly has 
a mystical, philosophical quality 
to it, which only adds onto the 
album’s daring scope.

Sonically, Junk doesn’t stray 

very much from M83’s grandiose 
electronic sound. There are 
still flourishes of saxophone 
solos, 
dizzying 
synthesizers 

and electric guitar breakdowns, 
but M83 goes a step further by 
utilizing New Wave and dance-
pop influences. Though there 
may not be a song on Junk as 
massive 
as 
M83’s 
excellent 

“Midnight 
City,” 
there 
are 

several that come close. On the 
shimmering opener “Do It, Try 
It,” Gonzalez longs for love and 

connection over a glittery, video-
game beat reminiscent of the 
1982 sci-fi flick “Tron.” “Go!,” 
the catchiest track off Junk, is 
bolstered by Mai Lan’s breathy 
voice and renowned musician 
Steve Vai’s monumental guitar 
solo. 
The 
album’s 
longest 

song, “Solitude,” is a chilling 
meditation on the past backed 
by an orchestral instrumental. 
Beck provides a much needed 
assistance on the spacey “Time 
Wind,” a whirlwind of electric 

rock in the vein of Tears for 
Fears. The post-disco jingles 
“Walkway Blues” and “Bibi the 
Dog” each showcase Gonzalez’s 
range, the former throbbing 
with an atmospheric intensity 
and the latter operating as a 
fun, loose groove. 

Junk succeeds in capturing 

the 
ethos 
of 
‘80s 
music, 

television and film, but it also 
delves into the sentimental 
and corny aspects of the three 
mediums with mixed results. 
The funky, string-heavy “Moon 
Crystal,” for example, is both 
captivating and confounding, 
especially 
since 
it 
sounds 

exactly like a mix between 
elevator muzak and a generic 
’80s sitcom theme song. “For 
the Kids” is a dreary, mawkish 
slow jam that is fortunately 
enhanced 
by 
the 
beautiful 

vocals 
of 
Norwegian 
guest 

Susanne 
Sundfør. 
Similarly, 

“Atlantique Sud” suffers from 
an 
element 
of 
unflattering 

schmaltz, but Gonzalez and 
Lan’s 
mesmerizing 
French 

duet saves it from becoming 
too cloying. The two-minute 
interlude “Tension” also starts 
out with a syrupy guitar reverb, 
until 
Gonzalez 
lays 
down 

some tantalizing synths and 
transforms it into something 
awe-inspiring. 

Even with its overly romantic 

tendencies towards the past, 
Junk 
remains 
a 
grounded 

portrait of the importance and 
magic of art and its ability to 
last throughout generations. 
It’s definitely not M83’s most 
accomplished 
record, 
as 
it 

meanders between profound 
and sappy. But despite Junk’s 
imperfections, 
Gonzalez’s 

extraordinary 
vision 
shines 

through in the end.

‘Demolition’ portrays 
midlife crisis in film

By DANIEL HENSEL

Daily Arts Writer

“Everything is a metaphor.” 

A cut, a beat, then he repeats, 
whispering 
to 
himself 
— 

“metaphor.” 
This 
was 

not 
the 
first 

time 
during 

the course of 
“Demolition” 
that 
I 
rolled 

my eyes, and 
it 
certainly 

wasn’t the last, 
but it was perhaps the most 
emblematic. The latest from 
Canadian director Jean-Marc 
Vallée 
(“Wild” 
and 
“Dallas 

Buyers Club”), “Demolition” is 
a midlife crisis comedy-drama 
burdened by its overly clear 
metaphorical premise.

In 
“Demolition,” 
Davis 

Mitchell 
(Jake 
Gyllenhaal, 

“Nightcrawler”) 
is 
an 

investment banker whose wife, 
Julia (Heather Lind, “Mistress 
America”) is tragically killed 
in 
a 
car 
accident. 
While 

Julia’s parents are devastated, 
particularly 
her 
father 
Phil 

(Chris Cooper, “Adaptation.”), 
Davis seems to be all right, 
returning to work very soon 
after. But as Phil recovers 
from his grief, Davis seems 
to descend into it. He writes 
a letter to a vending machine 
company 
complaining 
about 

a stuck bag of M&M’s, which 
quickly devolves into a series of 
rambling confessionals about 
his former life with Julia. The 
customer service representative, 
Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts, 
“Birdman”), is a single mom who 
smokes pot. Concerned about his 
letters, she begins to develop a 
non-romantic relationship with 
Davis as she drifts away from 
her boss, whom she is dating.

The 
key 
relationship 
in 

the film, though, is between 
Davis and Karen’s son, Chris 
(Judah Lewis, “Point Break”), a 
rebellious tween who smokes, 
yet 
chides 
his 
mother 
for 

the same. Chris is stumbling 
through adolescence and finding 
his identity — Davis, whom 
Chris initially despises, comes 
to be his trusted confidant and 
counsel. Together, they become 
a team of demolishers. Davis 
finds that the only way to fix 
his life is to break everything 
in it (except, of course, his car 
and bedroom, because those 
are the important possessions 
for Davis. Can you read my 
sarcasm?), which can either 
happen by high-powered tools 
or by careful deconstruction, 
separating an object into all 
of its parts. Davis finds joy in 
the wreckage and pain. The 
audience will not.

The screenplay by Bryan Sipe 

(“The Choice”) is awkward and 
clunky. In fact, it is like this 
paragraph — there are sentences 
with words in them that fit, but 
— there are no more positive 
attributes. More often than 
not, the sentences do not work 
together. Sipe uses the letters 
as narration instead of using 
dialogue. This is a cop-out. The 
film is billed as a comedy-drama 
but it is not funny. It is not very 
dramatic either. The events in 
the film are melodramatic, but 
there is no emotion.

Vallée, in his prior two films, 

both of which were major 
Oscar contenders, established 
a 
visual 
storytelling 
style. 

They 
were 
subjective, 
in 

which visions blended into the 
screen, memories intruded on 
scenes, and a story was told 
by the sum of its parts. For 
“Wild,” a film especially tied 
to memory, this proved to be an 
adept technique, albeit with a 
side effect of confusion. Here, 

though, Vallée loses his grip. 
The impressionist blend, for 
which Terrence Malick must be 
an influence, fails to unite all 
the moving parts of a needlessly 
complex story. While the film 
never drags (in fact, I was 
surprised by little I was bored 
by it), some transitions and 
images feel jarring rather than 
meaningful.

But whatever can be said 

about Vallée’s visual style, he 
is certainly an actor’s director. 
In fact, “Dallas Buyers Club” 
netted 
two 
acting 
Oscars 

and “Wild” earned two more 
nominations. 
Thankfully, 

Vallée saved this film from 
misery by assembling a terrific 
cast, especially Cooper, one 
of the finest actors living. 
Watts and Gyllenhaal aren’t 
doing their best work here; 
their characters’ emotions are 
infinitely complex and they 
come close, but they never quite 
reach the finish line.

The film is simply never 

compelling. Rather than focus 
on Davis’s inner turmoil, it 
turns to his recovery. But light 
is only valuable insofar as it 
prevents 
darkness; 
without 

understanding what Davis is 
feeling, we can never know 
why his acts of destruction, 
and his compassion for Chris, 
matter. Plus, because Davis’s 
life is so seeped in privilege, 
it’s impossible for us common 
folk to find solace in his 
decisions. Who among us can 
cope with loss by destroying 
all of our possessions and then, 
presumably, 
rebuying 
them? 

Vallée, it seems, wanted to 
make a film that can fit into 
midlife crisis film craze of the 
mid-1990s 
(think 
“American 

Beauty” or “Office Space”) but 
his twenty-first century update 
just doesn’t do anything new. Or 
interesting.

Classic, impossible 
stories in ‘Sotto Voce’

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

It is often remarked that great 

art is “timeless.” It’s a vessel 
which somehow transcends the 
sea of society and temporality to 
approach the 
undiscovered 
country 
of 

an 
aesthetic 

ideal. 
Which 

certainly 
is 

a 
romantic 

thought, 
but 

one 
which 

doesn’t 
necessarily 
hold up under 
close analysis — it could easily 
be countered that great art, 
rather than being “timeless” 
is in fact imbued with an 
excess of time, a multiplicity 
of temporal place. It isn’t that 
great art doesn’t belong to any 
time; it’s that it belongs to many 
times, contains themes with a 
cross-generational resonance, 
captures not only the zeitgeist 
of the era in which it was 
created but also imbibes the 
enduring spirit of humanity. 
And while it certainly is too 
soon to pass any judgments 
regarding its greatness, Ann 
Arbor audiences will have an 
opportunity to experience a 
play next week which embraces 
this principle of multiple times: 
Nilo Cruz’s “Sotto Voce.”

“I was actually going to be 

assisting a director named Peter 
Brook on this play, and it was 
going to be performed in France 
in French,” said Héctor Flores 
Komatsu, a School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance senior and the 
director of “Sotto Voce.”

Komatsu 
said 
he 
was 

initially introduced to the play 
through 
a 
production 
that 

fell through. “I read the play 
and I was immediately struck 
by all these three characters, 
and by the themes of refugees, 
and helping people in need, 
and the impossibility of love, 
discovering ourselves through 
literature, 
through 
reading 

other people’s things.”

After the initial production 

failed to materialize, Komatsu 
contacted the playwright to 
inquire about the possibility 
of putting on a production of 
“Sotto Voce” in Ann Arbor.

“This play has just sat in 

the back of my mind, so I 
spoke (to) Nilo (Cruz) and 
said ‘I would love to do this at 
Michigan’ — it’s not published 
yet, but ‘I would love if I could 
direct it and share it with the 
community 
of 
Ann 
Arbor, 

especially given the subject of 
refugees right now,’ ” Komatsu 
said. “It approaches the subject 
of refugees not in terms of 
key figures, or (statistics), but 
rather in a very human aspect. 
It affects us all; it’s a pain that 
creates more pain here and 
there, and in a way comes to 
affect people from all parts of 
the world.”

“Sotto Voce” tells two stories 

which take place decades apart, 
linked by a common character, 
a 
German 
writer 
named 

Bemadette Kahn. The earlier of 
these two stories takes place in 
the late 1930s; a young Jewish 
man, Ariel Strauss, and his 
sister set sail from Germany 
bound for Cuba, fleeing from 
Hitler’s regime along with 900 
some other Jewish individuals. 
Behind them they leave Ariel’s 
lover, Bemadette — before them 
they face the impassive visages 
of Cuba and America, both of 
which turn away the refugees. 
The ship turns back to Europe, 
and upon arrival the siblings 
vanish among Hitler’s horrors. 
Bemadette later moves to New 
York, where in the ensuing 
decades she has become a 
successful novelist, but has 
never written about her former 
lover.

“Out of nowhere comes this 

young 
Jewish 
Cuban 
man, 

a 
student 
(named 
Saquiel 

Rafaeli), 
calling 
her 
home 

(phone)” Komatsu said. “He 
says ‘I’m here in New York to 
ask you about Ariel Strauss. I 
found the love letter you sent to 
him while he was on the boat, 
and we’re interested in the 
stories of the human tragedy 
that was forgotten, we want the 
world to hear these stories so it 
doesn’t happen again.’ ”

Bemadette 
resists 
talking 

about 
Strauss, 
but 
Saquiel 

persists, communicating with 
the writer through phone and 
the intermediary of Bemadette’s 
Colombian maid Lucila Pulpo.

“Little by little they start 

to develop this very intimate 
relationship, between writer 
and student, young and old-
age,” 
Komatsu 
said. 
“In 

which (Saquiel) becomes the 
imaginary 
Ariel 
Strauss 
in 

(Bemadette’s) mind, because 
she can only hear his voice, and 
it reminds her so much of the 
voice of Ariel Strauss.”

Komatsu 
views 
the 
play 

as containing a great deal of 
meaning beyond the actual 
words, 
conveyed 
through 

human interaction and subtlety 
of expression.

“It’s the experience beyond 

the words that is at the core 

of this piece,” Komatsu said. 
“It’s called ‘Sotto Voce,’ which 
means under voice … there’s 
something about the subtlety of 
words and the silence between 
the words, just like the silence 
between music. It’s a very 
lyrical piece. When you read it, 
it feels like a composition.”

Komatsu 
also 
discussed 

the cast of the play — a small 
production, 
the 
play 
only 

calls for three actors and one 
musician, and is made up 
of students from the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance. 
Bemadette, Saquiel and Lucila 
are played by Larissa Marten, 
Aaron Weinstein and Anastasia 
Zavitzanos, 
respectively, 
all 

of whom are pursuing a BFA. 
Julian Bridges, who is a SMTD 
Percussion and Jazz Studies 
major, will be providing music 
for the production.

“It’s an international cast. 

The girl playing Bemadette 
is 
actually 
German 
… 
she 

was born in America, but she 
speaks German fluently, she 
goes there every summer, so 
she understands things very 
inherently about the character, 
because she understands that 
world a little closer,” Komatsu 
said. “The Colombian maid 
is being played by Anastasia 
Zavitzanos, 
who 
is 
Greek-

American, 
and 
she’s 
quite 

fantastic 
… 
and 
there’s 
a 

connection right now with 
Greece and the refugee crisis, 
so it’s been very close for her.”

Additionally, 
the 
actor 

playing 
Saquiel, 
Aaron 

Weinstein, was born in Puerto 
Rico, but was adopted by a 
Jewish family, thus making 
him almost a mirror imagine of 
Saquiel.

“Each of us have our own 

personal searches that we’re 
figuring out, by reading the 
play,” Komatsu said. “I think 
it’s important then that it’s 
really sensitive actors, who 
really understand it to a much 
more human level.”

The performance of “Sotto 

Voce” in Arthur Miller Theatre, 
which is sponsored by the 
Frankel 
Center 
for 
Judaic 

Studies, the Department of 
Latina/o Studies and Arts at 
Michigan, will be the first 
performance of the play on a 
college campus, and only its 
third performance ever. The 
play itself will be published the 
same day as the performance. 
Komatsu has had conversations 
with Cruz about the work, 
but he also notes much of the 
play has to be discovered in 
the process of rehearsing and 
performing it.

“With any kind of literary 

work you have to sort of 
inhabit it, and figure it out 
with patience,” Komatsu said. 
“There’s nothing that Nilo could 
explain to us that isn’t already 
in the play … the important 
thing is empathy.”

Komatsu also noted several 

themes which he has personally 
absorbed from the play.

“As people who are young, 

we forget that time is a thing, 
and that time exists, but that 
time is also scarce,” Komatsu 
said. “As someone who is young, 
coming into a play like this, it 
has already started to teach me 
a lot, about ‘how can you still 
find life and the desire to live 
when you’re 80 years old, and 
you feel like you have nothing 
ahead of you?’ And then you 
find something that is there. 
There is always something to be 
found if you look.”

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

It is often 

remarked that 
art is timeless.

‘Cleopatra’ is sad 
boy-strumming

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

You thought the last haunting 

echoes of upbeat guitar strums 
and intermittent clapping that 
“Ho 
Hey” 

introduced had 
finally, finally, 
died 
down. 

But The Lum-
ineers are back 
at it again with 
their 
newest 

release, Cleopa-
tra. This album 
is starkly minimalist, with lead 
singer Wesley Schultz’s vocals 
accompanied only by quiet gui-
tar plucks. Devoid of songs that 
are trying too hard to be upbeat 
(as seen in their self-titled first 
album), Cleopatra is unapologeti-
cally bittersweet and nostalgic: 
an ode to the past as much as it is 
hope for the future. 

Despite 
not 
having 
crazy 

rhythms or interesting beats, 
this album is exciting in its bare 
honesty. Cleopatra opens with 
“Sleep On The Floor,” a ballad 
featuring Wesley Schultz sing-
ing fearlessly about leaving the 
place he calls home. “ ’Cause if we 
don’t leave this town / we might 
not never make it out” stands 
starkly against a steady, muted 
background. “Ophelia” holds the 
same austerity (the craziest thing 
this song puts out are wild piano 
solos). Yet, similar to “Sleep On 

The Floor,” “Ophelia” entraps lis-
teners not with glitter or glamour, 
but with its barefaced humanity. 
The same concept is repeated in 
“Gun Song” and “Angela,” with 
both songs quiet yet powerful in 
the way they seem to offer lis-
teners a window into something 
that’s incredibly private and ten-
der. Wesley Schultz seems to be 
singing for nobody else but him-
self, and it comes through in the 
way that these songs are authen-
tic, genuine and a lifeline to the 
very core of The Lumineers.

It’s in this way that The Lum-

ineers’ improvement from their 
first album shines through. With 
songs like “Ho Hey” and “Stub-
born Love,” there was very much 
an apparent desire to create songs 
that were popular, which caused 
many of them to come across as 
stiff and forced. However, four 
years can really make all the dif-
ference: 
Cleopatra 
showcases 

how centered and comfortable 
The Lumineers have gotten with 
their personal voice. The songs 
are more natural, intimate and 
Schultz’s voice has no hesitation 
as he sings about everything from 
lost loves to strained family rela-
tionships.

However, while this album 

does prove that The Lumineers 
can produce meaningful music, 
it still has its faults. While songs 
on Cleopatra are deeply intimate, 
they also can become repetitive 
as the album goes on. There was 

no variation, which meant that 
eight or nine songs in the 11-track 
album, things get a little dull. The 
familiarity established with the 
first couple of songs vanishes, 
the point of no return is hit and 
The Lumineers turns into one 
flat line of sad-boy guitar strums. 
For example, “Sick In The Head” 
is serene, beautiful, melodious 
and delicate. Yet, because of its 
place in the album as one of the 
final songs, its completely lost 
under the cover of uniformity. 
“My Eyes” is similar in the sense 
that it had the potential to be an 
enjoyable song, but its place in 
the album ruined that possibil-
ity. If The Lumineers had used 
the ending portion of Cleopa-
tra to introduce a new sound to 
break the mold of melancholy, 
the album would have finished 
strong.

The genuine emotion this 

album introduces, despite its 
shortcomings, gives hope that 
The Lumineers have a voice 
with which they’re comfortable. 
Now that they’ve established a 
solid base, hopefully they can 
use the next albums they release 
to experiment and create music 
that pushes the boundaries of 
their sound. Altogether, Cleopa-
tra is a solid album; one that not 
only establishes The Lumineers 
as a band who has found their 
voice but also builds anticipation 
for all the future music The Lum-
ineers can produce.

BASEBALL
Michigan falters in 
sixth inning of loss

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
The 

Michigan baseball team was 
engaged in a pitcher’s duel 
through 
the first five 
and a half 
innings 
of 

its contest with Michigan State.

But that low-scoring game was 

a fleeting memory one inning 
later, after the Spartans put up 
eight runs in the bottom of the 
sixth en route to defeating the 
22nd-ranked Wolverines, 11-5. 
The loss for Michigan (3-2 Big 
Ten, 21-9 overall) marked its third 
in a row, its worst losing streak 
since a four-game skid in March 
last season.

“We’ve certainly hit our share 

of adversity the last seven days,” 
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“It happens in sports. It certainly 
happens in baseball. You just 
got 
to 
stay 

positive. 
We 

look forward to 
playing 
better 

tomorrow.”

The 
score 

was tied at two 
in the bottom 
of 
the 
sixth 

when Michigan 
State (5-1, 22-6) 
loaded 
the 

bases with no outs. The situation 
prompted Bakich to replace junior 
left-hander Brett Adcock — who 
had just come on in relief of senior 
left-hander Evan Hill — with 
junior right-hander Mac Lozer.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, Lozer was unable to 
escape the jam.

Right fielder Kris Simonton, 

the first batter Lozer faced, hit a 
single to center field that drove in 
two runs. Third baseman Justin 
Hovis followed up with a sacrifice 
fly to right field to put the Spartans 
ahead, 5-2. Catcher Matt Byars 
then hit an RBI double to extend 
Michigan State’s advantage to 
four. After shortstop Royce Ando 
grounded out, it appeared that 
Michigan might end the sixth 
down by a manageable four runs.

But a fielding error on the next 

at-bat let the Spartans tack on 
yet another run. First baseman 
Jordan 
Zimmerman 
further 

rubbed salt into the Wolverines’ 
wounds with an RBI single of 
his own. One batter later, Bakich 
replaced Lozer with sophomore 
right hander Jayce Vancena.

“(For) guys who pitch in those 

high-leverage situations, there 
are going to be days that are just 
not their day,” Bakich said. “They 
have to have a short memory. 
They have to have amnesia, and 
we’re going to count on (Lozer) to 
make big pitches in big spots again 
this weekend, if not tomorrow 
(against Eastern Michigan).”

Vancena, too, was victimized 

by a fielding error that widened 
Michigan’s deficit to seven. While 
Vancena allowed an RBI single on 
the ensuing at-bat, the carnage 
was ended when senior catcher 
Harrison 
Wenson 
whipped 

the ball to freshman shortstop 
Michael Brdar, who tagged the 
runner at third to finally get the 
Wolverines out of the inning.

“It’s always a relief to get off the 

field after a long inning like (the 
sixth),” said senior outfielder Matt 
Ramsay. “It was great to get back 
in the dugout, because everyone 
looked at each other and we were 
like, ‘It’s go time.’ There wasn’t any 
doubt on anyone’s faces.”

Before 
the 
sixth-inning 

collapse, it was Michigan who 
scored first.

With two outs in the third 

inning, Ramsay stole third and 
scored on a throwing error, and 
the Wolverines then mustered a 
pair of two-out singles. But they 
were unable to extend their lead.

“I think we were hitting the 

ball pretty well as a team,” Ramsay 
said. “But I think what wasn’t 
happening was that we weren’t 
getting those timely hits — those 
hits with runners in scoring 

position.”

With 
the 

bases 
loaded 

on one out, 
the 
Spartans 

struck 
back 

in the bottom 
of the third 
by driving in 
two runs off 
a single and a 
fielding error, 

but Hill limited the damage to 
just that. 

“I thought our defense played 

sloppy 
today,” 
Bakich 
said. 

“Pitching and defense has been a 
staple of our success in the early 
goings, and it needs to continue to 
be a cornerstone of our success. 
We just gotta be better in those 
two areas to be the best team that 
we can be.”

The 
Wolverines 
remained 

down, 2-1, until the top of the fifth, 
when they put runners on second 
and third with no outs. Junior 
right fielder Carmen Benedetti 
brought the tying run home 
when he grounded out to second, 
scoring sophomore infielder Jake 
Bivens. That left Ramsay on third 
with only one out.

But Michigan was unable to 

take the lead, as Wenson struck 
out and senior outfielder Cody 
Bruder grounded out to finish the 
inning. The score remained tied 
until the deluge of the sixth frame.

“We had some spots in the 

early innings where we weren’t 
able to capitalize,” Ramsay said. 
“It’s good to get early runs.”

The Wolverines did show some 

life in the top of the ninth when 
they trailed, 11-3. Senior catcher 
Dominic Jamett roped a bases-
loaded, two-run double to left 
field to cut the deficit to six. But 
the Wolverines’ rally was quickly 
extinguished when Bruder lined 
out and Benedetti was thrown out 
at second base.

“We just got our bats and 

continued to put quality at-bats 
on,” Ramsay said. “It’s a sign of a 
good team that even after getting 
punched in the face, we were still 
able to put together some quality 
at-bats together after that.”

“We’ve certainly 
hit our share of 
adversity the last 

seven days.”

SOFTBALL
Wolverines face struggling Spartans

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

Averaging more than eight runs 

per game, the No. 2 Michigan 
softball team’s offense scores in a 
prolific manner 
and 
receives 

abundant 
production from 
top to bottom.

In their first 

two conference 
series, 
the 

Wolverines 
scored 65 runs 
in six games and 
notched a 5-1 
record. 
Junior 

third baseman 
Lindsay 
Montemarano 
emerged 
during 
that 
stretch 

as Michigan’s most potent bat, 
setting a new career high for 
home runs in a season. Senior 
second baseman Sierra Romero 

also upped her batting average to 
.500, good for fourth in the nation.

Then, in last weekend’s series-

opening game against Nebraska, 
the Wolverines’ offense went 
missing. Facing Cornhusker ace 
Cassie McClure, Michigan struck 
out just twice, but registered a 
meager four hits.

“I think you have to credit their 

pitching,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “(McClure) was 
on her game.”

Frazzled 
by 
McClure’s 

prowess in the circle, Romero, 
Montemarano and junior left 
fielder Kelly Christner were all 
kept hitless in Michigan’s 1-0 loss.

“To give up one run and lose, 

that’s not because of the pitching,” 
Hutchins said. “We were all trying 
too hard, and trying too hard is as 
bad as not trying at all.”

On Saturday and Sunday, the 

Wolverines’ lineup — revitalized 
and eager to move beyond the 
previous 
night’s 
goose 
egg 

— reemerged in commanding 
fashion. Sierra Lawrence homered 
in each game, and Sunday’s two-
run blast was the culmination of 
a late Michigan comeback that 
propelled the Wolverines (7-2 Big 
Ten, 29-4 overall) to their second 
win of the weekend.

For Michigan, a chance to 

improve 
upon 
its 
offensive 

numbers and record another 
conference win presents itself 
Wednesday in the form of a 
struggling Michigan State team.

The Spartans (2-7, 20-19), who 

entered conference play with a 
winning record but without a win 
against a ranked team, have won 
only one of their last six games. 
That lone win came against fellow 
Big Ten cellar dweller Maryland.

However, 
Michigan 
State 

possesses 
ample 
offensive 

talent and is sure to challenge 
the 
Wolverines’ 
inconsistent 

pitching staff led by fifth-year 
senior Sara Driesenga and junior 

Megan Betsa. Ebonee Echols, Lea 
Foerster and Sarah Gutknecht 
each hit over .350, combined for 61 
RBI and have totaled nine home 
runs, which pales in comparison 
to Michigan’s power hitters.

But 
a 
Spartan 
pitching 

staff 
marked 
by 
youth 
and 

inconsistency is sure to be a boon 
for the Wolverines’ prospects. Dani 
Goranson has been plagued by a 
tendency to give up home runs and 
walks, as she has given up 10 and 
18, respectively. Kristina Zalewski 
logs the majority of innings and 
enters the game with a 9-10 record.

Despite its recent skid and 

evident shortfalls, Michigan State 
has played close with top teams this 
year and nearly recorded an upset 
win in Ann Arbor last season. The 
Spartans will be a testing opponent 
for Michigan, one sure to relish the 
chance of potentially knocking off 
their in-state rival. Meanwhile, 
the Wolverines hope their offense 
paves the way to a routine win.

‘M’ dominates Niagara

Wolverines snap 
three-game skid, 
get back on track 
with blowout win

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

It had been a tough stretch for 

the Michigan women’s lacrosse 
team going into a home game 
against 
Niagara on 
Tuesday. 
The Wolverines were coming 
off a three-game losing streak, 
which included a blowout loss to 
No. 16 Northwestern.

For a moment against the 

Purple 
Eagles 
(2-2 
Metro-

Atlantic Athletic Conference, 
6-6 overall), it looked as though 
it might be another tough outing 
for the Wolverines (0-2 Big Ten, 
6-8 overall). Their offense came 
out sputtering, and nearing the 
midpoint mark of the first half, 
they were still scoreless. Then, 
with 16:02 remaining in the 
half, junior attacker Tess Korten 
struck first and Michigan never 
looked back, winning 13-1.

“I 
think 
(this 
win 
is) 

incredibly important for our 
program and for these women 
who work hard every single day,” 
said Michigan coach Jennifer 
Ulehla. “It always comes back 
to us trying to grow from every 
experience and get better every 
single day. When you’re building 
a program, it’s not easy and it 
takes time. It’s a journey. It’s not 
a sprint, it’s a marathon.”

Korten was at the center of 

Michigan’s offense all game, 
with three goals and one assist.

The offensive production didn’t 

stop with her, though. Seven 
different players scored goals for 
the Wolverines, including junior 
attacker Kelly Schlansker, who 

matched Korten’s goal output. 
The pair finished as the game’s 
highest scorers.

“I was just really happy with 

the offense in general,” Ulehla 
said. “So many different people 
had 
opportunities 
and 
took 

advantage of them and scored.”

Not to be outdone by the offense, 

Michigan’s 
defense 
stepped up as 
well. It forced 
20 
turnovers 

and 
held 

Niagara 
to 

only one goal. 
The 
effort 

matched 
the 

best defensive 
output in the 
history of the Wolverines’ three-
year-old program.

“Defense has got to be a 

strong unit, and they didn’t 
play individually today,” Ulehla 

said. “There was a little bit of 
a breakdown at one point, but 
then they regrouped. I thought 
that the 77 defense was strong, 
the goalie performances were 
strong and I thought we did 
a great job in our transitional 
defense as well.”

The tough stretch prior to the 

game 
wasn’t 

the 
first 
of 

the season for 
Michigan, 
as 

it had another 
three-game 
losing 
skid 

from 
March 

4 
to 
March 

18, eventually 
halted 
by 
a 

9-4 win over 

Duquesne.

Now, the focus turns to 

maintaining 
this 
momentum 

and stringing together some 
wins. But the schedule doesn’t 

get easier for the Wolverines. 
They will host No. 12 Penn State 
on Sunday before No. 1 Maryland 
comes to Ann Arbor the week 
after.

“(The win) definitely was 

important for the team morale 
and to get everyone back on the 
same page, to know we have 
something to work towards,” 
Korten said. “We have two, 
three big games coming up and 
then the Big Ten playoff season 
to look forward to.”

Added Ulehla: “(It’s) just great 

for camaraderie, and (we can) 
feel the big pressure off our back. 
We know what’s coming this 
weekend: Penn State. We know 
we’ve got to get back to business.”

If the Wolverines are able 

to get back to business and fire 
on all cylinders like they did 
Tuesday, perhaps they may earn 
their first win over a ranked 
team in program history.

Grading Michigan’s hockey season

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

After 
making 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament for the first time since 
2011, the Michigan hockey team 
ended its season with a 5-2 loss to 
North Dakota on March 26. Before 
we turn the page to next season, 
the Daily evaluates the Wolverines’ 
performance in 2015-16.

Offense: A+

The 
Wolverines 
boasted 

a historic offense this year, 
averaging 4.76 goals per game. 
That mark was good for first 
nationally, and no team has scored 
at that clip since at least the 1999-
2000 season.

Michigan was held under three 

goals just seven times in 40 games 

— one of which came in the NCAA 
Tournament 
against 
eventual 

national champion North Dakota.

The CCM line — composed of 

freshman forward Kyle Connor 
and junior forwards JT Compher 
and Tyler Motte — led the prolific 
attack, combining for 83 of the 
Wolverines’ 181 goals.

Connor notched 71 points, 

while Compher and Motte tallied 
63 and 57, respectively.

The trio was among the top four 

nationally in points. Additionally, 
Connor led the country in points 
and Compher earned the No. 1 
spot in assists.

The 
power-play 
unit 
was 

exceptional as well, ranking first 
nationally 
with 
a 
32-percent 

conversion rate.

After losing Andrew Copp, 

Dylan Larkin and Zach Hyman 

last year, the expectations for 
Michigan’s offense were on the 
modest end. That trio accounted 
for more than 25 percent of the 
team’s points, but the Wolverines 
made it look like they didn’t even 
miss them this year.

Still, Michigan will be faced 

with another retooling process 
on the offensive end next season, 
as Motte and Connor have 
signed professional contracts 
and Compher’s decision has yet 
to be announced.

Defense: B-

It was essentially the same 

story but a different season for 
Michigan’s blueliners.

The 
Wolverines 
strung 

together some stout defensive 
performances 
throughout 
the 

season, 
but 
those 
stretches 

didn’t come nearly often enough. 
Frequently, 
Michigan’s 
potent 

offense carried the team to 
victories even after conceding 
four to six goals.

The team tied for 38th in team 

defense nationally — averaging 
3.03 goals against per game. In 
that category, Michigan regressed 
a bit from last season, when it 
conceded an average of 2.9 goals.

That’s not to say there weren’t 

flashes of success. The Wolverines 
ended the regular season with 
a sweep of No. 14 Penn State, in 
which the Nittany Lions mustered 
just two goals. In November, 
Michigan also held then-No. 11 
Boston University to four goals in 
two games.

But there were always hiccups, 

such as the penultimate series 
against an unranked Ohio State 
team 
when 
the 
Wolverines 

conceded 13 goals.

Sophomore defenseman Zach 

Werenski headlined the defense, 
accumulating 35 points with 11 
goals and 24 assists. His point total 
was good for fourth on the team 
behind the CCM line, and the next-
highest scoring defenseman was 
junior Michael Downing with 20.

Now, Michigan is tasked with 

finding answers in its defensive 
zone, as both Werenski and 
Downing left for the NHL. The 
impacts that freshmen Nicholas 
Boka and Joe Cecconi had, in 
addition to the emergence of 
Nolan De Jong, are encouraging 
for future success.

But the Wolverines certainly 

still have plenty of room left for 
improvement.

Goaltending: A-

The goaltending situation was 

shaky to begin the season, as 
senior Steve Racine and junior 
Zach Nagelvoort looked poised for 
yet another position battle. Racine 
picked up an injury early in the 
year, and Nagelvoort took over the 
starting duties.

But 
Racine 
returned 
from 

the injury in the Great Lakes 
Invitational and firmly seized a 
spot between the pipes for the 
remainder of the season.

For the most part, the senior 

netminder seemed to get better 
with each weekend, culminating 
with two exceptional games in the 
NCAA Tournament. He played like 
a man possessed, making sprawling 
save after sprawling save.

Racine notched 28 saves against 

Notre Dame and played with the 
pressure of a 2-1 deficit on his 
shoulders for nearly two whole 
periods before the Wolverines 
scored an equalizer and sent the 
game to overtime.

Though the final score didn’t 

indicate 
it, 
his 
performance 

against 
eventual 
national 

champion North Dakota was even 
more impressive.

Racine allowed five goals, but 

that was largely due to the fact 

that Michigan was outmatched 
all over the ice. Without him, 
the Wolverines could have found 
themselves in a 5-0 hole as early 
as the first period. The Fighting 
Hawks peppered him with 49 
shots, and two of their goals came 
on the power play.

He finished the season with a 

.914 save percentage and a 2.89 
goals-against average, and given 
his performances to end the 
season, Michigan has a void to fill 
in between the pipes next season.

43,625 students attend the University of 

Michigan. Only 12 are Students of the Year. 
Nominated by their peers and mentors, this 
small handful of students has been chosen for 
a multitude of reasons. An ability to exceed 
in both sport and academics, a commitment 
to community service, a resilience in the face 
of personal struggle — these are just a few 
of the qualities that the students that popu-
late these pages possess. But they, like every 
student, are also much more than 750-word 
profiles. They are dreamers, friends, inspira-
tions. They make mistakes (but maybe less 
than others). They are complex, dynamic 
humans. They are the leaders and best.

Meet the Students of the Year. They’re 

happy to meet you.

“The job is to ask questions—it always was—and 
to ask them as inexorably as I can. And to face 
the absence of precise answers with a certain 
humility.”
— Playwright ARTHUR MILLER, who graduated from the University in 1938, 
on the importance of asking questions..

on the record: university success stories

“The logic of an occupation, I think, is if you feel 
voiceless about a burning issue of great, great 
importance, and the institutions have failed you, the 
only way to get leverage for your voice is to occupy 
their space in order to get their attention.”

—Activist TOM HAYDEN, who graduated from the University in the early 60s, 
and was a major figure of the civil rights movement.

“The worst crime of all would be that a mistake 
happens and no one talks about it or learns from 
it. So, as unsettling as it is to think about, these 
mistakes, complications and unexpected outcomes 
get discussed openly and everyone hopefully gains 
something from it.

—Dr. SANJAY GUPTA, who graduated from the Medical School in 1993.

SA senior Laura Meyer’s immediate 
response to being chosen as Student 
of the Year was to share the recogni-

tion with all the other member of the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness Center.

“It’s really fun to be recognized for some-

thing that I’ve worked really hard on,” she 
said. “But at the same time a lot of the stuff 
that we’ve all accomplished has been done 
together, so I want to recognize the people 
who have also helped make everything hap-
pen.”

Meyer is volunteer coordinator at SAPAC 

meaning she organizes all of the volunteers 
to make sure everything runs smoothly and 
does community organizing and outreach. 
She helped coordinate big events like the 
annual Speak Out, Revolution — a spring art 
show — and the Week of Activism.

Meyer said she first joined SAPAC because 

she wanted to be a part of an organization 
that actually took action on a larger scale and 
made a significant impact on the community 
it is a part of.

“I got involved as a sophomore because 

I was really interested in being involved in 
an organization that had a more formalized 
structure,” she said. “That way I knew that 
the work I did would be executed and be con-
tinued into the future. I was tired of being in 
organizations and them not being organized 
enough to really accomplish anything.”

Meyer has touched the lives of many 

through SAPAC, but more introspectively, 
Meyer said the organization has greatly 
influenced her own life too. SAPAC empha-
sizes reflection for its leadership members, 
which has allowed Meyer to think about her 
own qualities as a leader.

“It has allowed me to think about my val-

ues, leadership style and identity and how 
that impacts how I am as a leader,” she said. 
“It’s sharpened my vision into the future and 
made me think more about what my guid-
ing values and principles are. I’m constantly 
learning from all of these people, and that 
has been the biggest place of growth for me.”

SAPAC also focuses on self-care for all 

those involved in the organization. Meyer 
said if she feels she is not properly taking 
care of herself, then she cannot do as much 
for others as she would like.

“You can’t do this work if you are at 100 

percent yourself,” she said. “Centralizing 
that and focusing on it in my own life can be 
really difficult. I always made to do more, but 
I can’t always accomplish much if I’m not at 
100 percent.”

But, for Meyer, the most important aspect 

of SAPAC is its social justice element. She 
said social justice is a core part of her person-

ality and SAPAC gives her an outlet to apply 
that.

“For me something that guides me and 

is very central to who I am is the vision of 
a socially just world,” she said. “Working in 
SAPAC we centralize our work on one issue, 
but we complicate that with all these other 
issues that also impact that. I am really inter-
ested in social change, and I feel like I can 
accomplish that through SAPAC.”

For Meyer, SAPAC has become an incred-

ibly important part of her life, giving her 
energy and encouraging her to do as much 
as she can to help her community. She also 
noted the importance of community within 
the group, noting one of the reasons she 
became so involved was all of the “bomb-ass 
people.”

“I’ve adored my time at SAPAC,” she said. 

“It is the engine of my life. It drives me for-
ward. It gives me this energy that I did not 
have before. I’m so thankful for the experi-
ence to learn more about who I am.”

Because of her work at SAPAC, Meyer said 

she wishes to continue this sort of work with 
social justice by working in government rela-
tions for a women’s health non-profit follow-
ing her upcoming graduate.

“Working at SAPAC has helped me think 

about what I want to do sort of day-to-day,” 
she said. “And it helps me with thinking 
about the way you can incorporate social jus-
tice into everything you do and make it more 
of a daily practice rather than a broad long-
term goal. I know whatever I do, that I idea of 
justice will be with me and shape what I do.”

ailing from Manhattan’s Upper 
East Side, LSA junior Rebecca 
Rosenthal seems to naturally thrive 

under the fast-paced lifestyle that accompa-
nies the pressure of a busy schedule and a 
variety of extracurricular commitments.

Double majoring in English and Politi-

cal Science, Rosenthal plans to attend law 
school after she graduates. But when she’s 
not writing papers or studying into the early 
morning hours at the library, she’s focusing 
on creating positive change on campus.

She joined the Wolverine Support Net-

work, a peer-led mental health support 
group piloted last winter, during its inau-

gural semester. She has since then played a 
major role in developing and expanding the 
program. Next semester, she will serve as a 
director of the program. 

WSN places participating students, at 

random, into confidential, weekly support 
groups. Student leaders are trained to facili-
tate dialogue between peers coping with a 
wide variety of mental health issues, includ-
ing eating disorders, issues of gender or sex-
uality, anxiety and depression. WSN also 
offers “Kickback Fridays” every other week 
for both members and the campus commu-
nity at large, in which leaders plan activities 
such as yoga or other stress-relieving activi-

ties as relaxing alternatives to other week-
end plans. 

“When I came to college, I was lucky 

enough to find a niche and a group espe-
cially through joining a sorority that I fit 
into quickly,” Rosenthal said, referring to 
her sorority, Delta Delta Delta. “So if I ever 
needed anything, I had friends to turn to, 
but I met a lot of students through different 
classes and activities who I could see were 
struggling with anxiety or depression — and 
they were things that I knew really well — 
and I could tell they had nowhere to turn.”

Rebecca said she sees WSN as an impor-

tant alternative resource for students who 
may not feel comfortable making appoint-
ments at Counseling and Psychological 
Services. She noted that student leaders 
are trained to direct students to other pro-
fessional resource centers on campus, such 
as CAPS or Sexual Assualt Prevention and 
Awareness Center, if they identify a need. 
Currently, WSN has 150 active members 
and 60 student leaders.

“The hour I lead group every week — 

which is Thursday from 8 to 9 p.m. — that’s 
the highlight of my week, and it’s the one 
hour of my week where I feel like I can be 
myself because I know the students enrolled 
in my group don’t judge anything I’m say-
ing,” Rebecca said. “I think it’s helped me 
being a leader just as much as I hope it’s 
helped them.”

As a director of WSN, she plans to both 

expand membership and promote mental 
health awareness on campus by reaching a 
larger audience of students and encourag-

ing them to attend Kickback Friday events.

In addition to WSN, Rosenthal also 

helped found Salad’s UP, a salad restaurant 
on East Liberty that was opened in Decem-
ber 2014 by then University seniors Robby 
Mayer and Max Steir. She currently works 
with managing, menu planning, marketing 
and design for the restaurant, which is set 
to expand this summer.

“It’s been crazy,” she said. “We had no 

idea what we were doing when we opened 
a restaurant, but it’s been so fun, and I love 
that.”

Rosenthal credits her passion and drive 

as an active member of the campus and Ann 
Arbor community to her parents as well 
as her grandfather, who was student body 
president during his time at Michigan.

“I’ve always been a busy person,” Rosen-

thal said. “Some people might say I stretch 
myself too thin, but I love being busy. I 
thrive when I’m busy because I’m more 
focused.”

“Sure, some nights I’m exhausted — I’m 

getting two hours of sleep and I’m miser-
able, and I wish I could stay at home and 
watch Netflix for six hours and go out with 
my friends more, but I wouldn’t change it,” 
she continued. “I’m so thankful for every 
opportunity I’ve been given at Michigan 
and that I’ve done outside of Michigan as 
well, and I think that I’ve become a more 
well-rounded individual.”

After college, she plans to continue 

impacting positive social change, either in 
the nonprofit or human rights law fields.

n paper, LSA sophomore Hannah 
Buck looks like every other high-
achieving person enrolled at the 

University of Michigan. She double majors in 
English and Communications with a concen-
tration in creative writing. She is currently 
acting as the Public Relations Chair member 
for the Groove Performance Group, a per-
cussion team that entertains audiences with 
trashcan drumming and plenty of glow-in-
the-dark paint.

However, the people that she befriends 

(and there are many) might be surprised to 
learn that Buck has more than just a rigorous 
class schedule and Groove performances to 
keep up with. Every day, Buck has to focus on 
her breathing, something that most people 
can take for granted. She is constantly bat-

tling cystic fibrosis, a chronic illness that 
attacks the lungs, causing often severe dam-
age over time as well as many other issues 
that affect quality and duration of life.

“It’s really hard to get out of bed in the 

morning when your body is just fighting 
itself,” Buck said. Yet somehow, she manages 
to not only get out of bed, but also accomplish 
more each day than many people do with a 
healthy set of lungs.

Buck’s disease is something that is hard to 

comprehend and even more difficult to live 
with, so she has dedicated herself to easing 
the burden for others by sharing her story. 
Her YouTube channel, HannahBreathes, 
is where she shares information about how 
she’s feeling, what her current health sta-
tus is, and any helpful tips she has for other 

people with CF. She also runs a blog for the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

“I get messages and e-mails on probably a 

weekly basis, from mostly students around 
the country and around the world either 
saying that I’ve helped them or asking for 
advice,” Buck said.

Her advice is usually about things like how 

to stay organized with the almost 30 differ-
ent medications she has to keep track of. 
However, most of the reason she has such a 
large audience is that her video chats tend to 
spill into general life philosophies and ideas 
that she is passionate about.

“I have so many platforms. I feel like that’s 

what I am on social media, just a human plat-
form,” she said, ticking them off on her fin-
gers. “You should read books. You shouldn’t 
smoke cigarettes. You should be an organ 
donor. You should be an advocate for mental 
health and you should fight the stigma. Just 
be a decent human, really, is my main thing.”

Buck’s life is an open book for the most 

part, even when talking about things that 
most people try and block out of their minds, 
for all the world to see and critique.

“Some things are uncomfortable,” Buck 

said. “More uncomfortable for me to share 
than my cystic fibrosis or my asthma or 
all my physical things was when I started 
speaking out about my anxiety and depres-
sion, because that is something that the gen-
eral public is conditioned to believe should be 
kept secret. You shouldn’t talk about that, it’s 
so embarrassing. And it was embarrassing, 
until I started getting those messages about 

how other people felt the same way.”

Many people that have cystic fibrosis do 

not attend college, and if they do, they take 
courses online or at a community college 
close to home. Just the fact that Buck is here, 
several hours away from home at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, is a huge deal.

“The biggest thing is that it is very hard 

and the balance does not come easily,” Buck 
said. “The semesters where I physically felt 
better, my grades were not as high, because 
I spent a lot more time focusing on running 
every day and I spent more hours doing treat-
ments. The semesters where my grades were 
better, I just felt like crap by the end of the 
semester because I neglected everything.”

It’s easy to forget that this vibrant, well-

spoken girl in the neon pink and yellow 
sweatshirt also sometimes finds herself lay-
ing in a hospital bed connected to a breathing 
tube. It doesn’t happen often, but occasion-
ally her health declines to the point where 
she has to go to the hospital for a few days so 
that they can monitor her breathing and get 
her back on track.

“For the record, cystic fibrosis is the most 

curable incurable disease. All we need is 
funds,” Buck said. “I’m very looking forward 
to new treatments and eventually the cure 
for CF. I am very confident in saying that it is 
within reach within my lifetime.”

In the meantime, Buck will be focusing on 

finding her perfect balance between school 
and health, writing, blogging and, of course, 
drumming on trashcans. 

“

I just love life, I really do,” LSA senior 
Ahmad Hider said with a wide smile at 
the start of the interview, with energy 

and enthusiasm that were present through-
out the entire conversation.

Hider began by listing what he loves 

about his life — family, friends, basketball, 
food and so on. His list was endless, but he 
noted education as his primary focus and 

passion during his three years at the Uni-
versity. He said education is the most pow-
erful tool one can have — it provides people 
opportunities to succeed, and it stays with 
you for life.

“I believe everyone should have all the 

opportunities to succeed in their lives,” he 
said. “You can strip someone of everything 
they have, but you can never strip away 

their education.”

For Hider, it was important to maintain 

a busy lifestyle to get as much out from his 
college education as he could. His main 
motivation is his family, whose early strug-
gles motivated Hider to be passionate about 
education.

“I’m a first-generation college student,” 

Hider said. “I saw the struggles (my parents) 
went through. My father started at a gas sta-
tion before he began working at a mechanic 
shop and was able to raise a family. My mom 
has always been the heart of the home, and 
I can never repay them for their sacrifices.”

Currently, Hider works as an undergrad-

uate researcher in Haoxing Xu’s group. Xu, 
an associate professor of molecular, cellular 
and developmental biology, and his team 
study lysosomes, waste disposal systems 
in the cell. Without lysosomes, the waste 
builds up and ultimately kills the cell.

Hider is involved with a project that 

focused on a disease with defective lyso-
some functions — how mutations in a pro-
tein called TRPML1 causes the defects 
leading to the disease. The results were 
recently published in Nature Cell Biology, 
and Hider is one of the co-authors on this 
publication.

Hider said he initially put in about 10 

hours a week to his experiments, but as he 
gained more responsibilities in the lab, he 
began to put in close to 30 to 40 hours a 
week.

“It got to a point where I went ‘you know 

what, I’m just going to sleep in the lab today,’ 
” Hider said. “The amount of work paid off 

because we got a paper published in Nature, 
which was a major accomplishment.”

But Hider cares deeply about educa-

tion for other students, too. He has taught 
CHEM 125 and 211, which are general 
chemistry and organic chemistry lab cours-
es, respectively. Hider said he loves see-
ing the reactions of the students from the 
instructor’s perspective — another reason 
for him to care about teaching.

“To see the happiness and smiles on peo-

ple’s faces when they learn and understand 
something new is amazing,” Hider said. 
“That really motivates me to focus on edu-
cation.”

His passion for education does not stop at 

the University level. He is constantly keep-
ing himself busy with his ideas — he is plan-
ning to launch a tutoring program for local 
elementary school students because “(edu-
cation) starts there.” He envisions the tutor-
ing to provide a more “hands-on” tutoring 
experience for the students.

“I just want to better the education for 

everyone, not just my own,” Hider said.

As for future plans, Hider said he’s unsure 

where his passions will take him exactly, 
but he intends to go into the medical field to 
help other people because the experiences 
will be rewarding. Right now, cardiovas-
cular surgery is on the top of his list, but he 
also has other interests.

“I really want to go into cardiovascular 

surgery,” Hider said. “But I always wanted 
to go into public health too … to focus on 
global health problems such as HIV.”

SA junior Jaimie Phelan has a lot on 
her plate: playing an instrumental 
role on the Women’s Track and Field 

team while working tirelessly with Athletes 
Connected and the Depression Center Stu-
dent Advisory Board as an advocate for end-
ing the stigma surrounding mental health 
issues. Yet, she never lets herself get too over-
whelmed.

“It definitely feels like a lot, but I also kind 

of have that mindset that I’m still learning,” 
she said. “I’m still growing and I’m sur-
rounded by so many amazing people on cam-
pus at Michigan and on our amazing team.”

Hailing from Ontario, Canada, Phelan 

decided to attend Michigan based on the 
strong psychology program and the success 
of the track and field team where, she imme-
diately made an impact — scoring at both 

Big Ten’s and nationals her freshmen year. 
Despite some setbacks due to injury, Phelan 
continued to persevere and just recently fin-
ished off this past indoor season with an All-
American title in the distance medley relay 
at NCAA Nationals and numerous personal 
records. However, Phelan quickly empha-
sized group effort, pointing to her teammates 
as sources of strength and encouragement 
over the course of the season.

“It felt awesome to be able to share it with 

the three other girls on the DMR team right 
there with us,” she said. “But I think every-
one on our team kind of helped us get there.”

She shows this perspective in all aspects of 

her life, and not just on the track.

“I’m definitely grateful to be a part of 

organizations that are so much bigger than 
myself,” Phelan said. “In Women’s Track 

and Field, we all put on the singlet with the 
block ‘M’, and then as soon as you put on that 
singlet, you’re representing Michigan. Then 
with the Depression Center’s Student Advi-
sory Board and Athlete’s Connected, it’s try-
ing to help everyone else deal with anything 
that they’re dealing with, anything that they 
may be struggling with.”

Phelan got involved with Athlete’s Con-

nected and the Depression Center’s Student 
Advisory Board during her sophomore year, 
and credits Will Heininger, Michigan defen-
sive end, and Trish Meyer, Program Direc-
tor for Outreach and Education, for helping 
introduce her to the programs and devel-
oping her passion for mental health. As she 
continued to attend more meetings, she felt 
like she could open up and share her own 
struggles that she was dealing with, while 
also becoming more aware of the resources 
available on campus.

“My freshman year I feel like I didn’t 

know about the resources that were avail-
able for mental health, and I think with how 
passionate I became for mental health, that’s 
one of the big things for me,” Phelan said. “I 
don’t want other people to feel confused. We 
all want it to be accessible for everyone on 
campus.”

Phelan describes Athlete’s Connected 

as an “open space” where student-athletes 
can come together to discuss anything and 
everything on their minds — whether it be 
academic stress or clinical depression.

“It’s very similar to an athletic injury, 

just the same way as if you were injured 
with anything. Like if we have a hurt ankle, 
we can go into the training room, get help 

from our trainers, it’s the same with mental 
health,” Phelan said. “If you are struggling, 
or just having a rough day and you need to 
take a step back, you can either come to Ath-
letes Connected, or there are the resources 
where you can get help from a professional 
or anyone else.”

Phelan’s joy for life at the University is 

absolutely contagious. This campus, she said, 
had a big impact on her.

“I honestly feel like Michigan is my second 

home,” she said with a smile spread across 
her face. “Every time you walk by and see a 
block ‘M’, it just makes you smile. I just love 
it.”

Her summer plans include continuing 

to advocate for mental health and working 
as hard as she can for her team, but Phelan 
has another noteworthy goal — making the 
Olympic Trials. 

“I’m going to try to go to trials, and with 

Nicole Sifuentes being here, it’s going to be a 
good experience. I get to go back home, see 
people and continue training,” she said.

Though she has big goals and high expec-

tations of herself, as both a national-caliber 
athlete and prominent leader, Phelan stress-
es the importance of taking life day-by-day 
and focusing on the little things. Her favorite 
quote is, “The smallest deed is better than 
the greatest intention.” She aspires to do all 
of the little things she can for the team, and 
all of the little things she can for the Univer-
sity of Michigan.

“I think doing the little things goes a long 

way and can mean a lot to someone,” Phelan 
said.

I

n a campus teeming with innova-
tors and entrepreneurs, Erin Johnson 
stands out. The sophomore, who is 

studying business and international studies, 
wants to clarify, though: hers “isn’t some 
superstar story.”

“I feel like all these other people are going 

to have all these crazy stories,” she said of 
the rest of the Student of the Year nominees. 
“I just feel like I decided to take on this role 
and I took it on to the best of my ability.”

Johnson is the president of optiMize, a 

student organization on campus focused on 
helping student entrepreneurs materialize 
their ideas. Unlike similar organizations, 

optiMize is centered on social impact — a 
phrase that Johnson says guides what she 
does.

“I think it’s just looking at everything 

you do on a daily basis and trying to figure 
out the most positive way to do it,” she said. 
“So if you want to accomplish something or 
make something better, how many people’s 
days can you improve?” she said.

Originally from Orlando, Fla., Johnson 

came to the University after childhood 
visits to Detroit and the surrounding area. 
Having attended smaller schools her entire 
life, the University offered the opportunity 
for “something bigger.” And after a chance 

encounter with an optiMize poster that 
said, “Why not me? Stop waiting for some-
one else to change the world,” Johnson was 
sold.

“That resonated with me just because I 

had never really had something phrased 
like that before,” she said. “I never thought 
of service as social change, as something 
that could have a worldwide impact.”

Johnson joined as a core team member, 

but was quickly moved to the marketing 
team her freshman year. Team leaders try to 
identify each member’s strengths and move 
him or her accordingly.

OptiMize’s main event is the Social Inno-

vation Challenge. Students who have ideas 
for social innovation and entrepreneurship 
apply in October, and over seven months, 
optiMize mentors and various workshops 
provide various resources to help turn these 
ideas into startups, student organizations or 
other. At the end of the year, a few of these 
groups are chosen for funding from opti-
Mize.

This allocation of funding is based on 

each team’s ability to make a social impact, 
its cultural competence and its growth 
throughout the year. The organization’s 
biggest donor is the nonprofit organiza-
tion United Way, and it also raises money 
from anonymous alumni donors. This year 
alone, Johnson and optiMize have raised 
$750,000 and have worked with more than 
250 students.

Johnson is careful to note the difference 

between competition and challenge: teams 
that apply do not get cut; they just don’t get 
all the funding. She distinguishes this kind 
of structure as a “self-challenge.”

“If every team were to be successful, 

everyone would be better off, because every 
team is making social change,” she said. 
“I think that’s the main thing that differ-
entiates optiMize and makes me love it so 
much.”

This summer, Johnson plans to help out 

with the optiMize Fellows program, in 
which she will mentor students who stay at 
the University over the summer and work 
on their projects.

Friends alternately describe Johnson as 

possessing “a kind of energy that lights up 
any room into which she walks” and some-
one who “would rather see someone else 
take ownership of a role and thrive.” It’s 
clear that Johnson, as optiMize’s president, 
is popular.

“We like to think of the environment and 

sustainability, but I like to think of sustain-
ability as also sustainability of people,” she 
said.

After this year, Johnson will no longer be 

the president of optiMize, but her involve-
ment with the organization will not stop 
there. Whether it’s being a future mentor 
or continually helping out and advising the 
group’s fundamental goal of social change 
Johnson has one main objective: “I just like 
making people feel important.”

ackham student Rama Mwenesi means a lot of 
different things to the people who know him. 
Within the University of Michigan community. To 

his fellow engineers — and many others, actually — he is 
the founder of E-MAGINE, a multidisciplinary student 
startup working to bring Internet access to remote areas 
in countries like Brazil, Sierra Leone, Kenya and Zambia.

To those others who know him from academia, he is a 

determined student, who has already completed an under-
graduate degree in Industrial and Operations Engineering 
through the University — accompanied by two minors, no 
less, in International Studies in Engineering and Design 
Engineering as well as a certificate in Entrepreneurship. 
As well, he who will be graduating this spring from an 
integrated master’s program at UM combining IOE and 
Health Management & Policy.

To his superiors and coworkers within the University’s 

health system, he is a health care engineering consultant, 
constantly seeking ways to improve patient care and safe-
ty, looking to avoid what he calls “stop-valve solutions” 
and instead concentrating efforts on long-term solutions 
and policies.

To those he works with through the office of Services 

for Students with Disabilities, he is a member of the Stu-
dent Advisory Board, who has helped students all across 
campus through the development of outreach and men-
torship programs, making the navigation of tumultuous 
waters just a little bit.

To the members of the University’s club boxing team, 

he is a trusted coach (and former four-year captain), 
confident in his athletes’ abilities and endlessly, tire-

lessly cheering them on when they enter into competition 
around the country.

He is all of these things to all of these groups of people, 

yet he still says most people don’t know him all that well. 
This, he elaborates, is because they don’t know where he’s 
come from, what he’s been through and just how difficult 
it has been for him to reach a position where he has gar-
nered not one, but two Student of the Year nominations 
— the first coming in 2013, when he was still an under-
graduate.

What the majority of these people are unaware of is that 

Rama suffered a brain injury due to multiple sports-relat-
ed concussions when he was younger, and his doctors, he 
said, were uncertain whether he’d even be around today 
to tell his story, let alone to be nearing the completion of a 
second degree from an institution of higher learning.

“When I came here to Michigan and I realized I am 

quote-unquote 'disadvantaged' compared to the rest of my 
peers in certain aspects, neurologically that is … the ques-
tion was: Am I going to give this up or not?” he said. “And 
then I reached out to the SSD [Services for Students with 
Disabilities] office and they really just transformed my 
entire experience here in terms of helping me understand 
what it is even that I’m going through.”

“It’s not like a broken arm or a broken leg where you can 

clearly see that so-and-so has, maybe, a challenge here or 
a problem there,” he continued. “The more neurologically 
complex these issues are, the harder it is to even explain 
to just any other person out there.”

Before coming to the University, Rama’s family and 

friends dissuaded him from doing so, saying they didn’t 

think it was worth it, that they thought he “wasn’t neu-
rologically able to make it through.” But Rama was deter-
mined to seek out education in the United States, despite 
the fact that he might someday not remember a thing he 
learned due to neurodegeneration.

“My whole M.O. from the very beginning was, as cli-

ché as it may sound: impossible is truly nothing,” he said. 
“Impossible is nothing, (and) as I look towards graduating 
in less than a month, this whole process — even this inter-
view and everything — I am truly grateful for Michigan, 
truly grateful for the opportunities it’s awarded me.”

So yes, Rama is many things — an international stu-

dent from Kenya; holder of an undergraduate degree in 
Industrial and Operations Engineering; a one-time dou-
ble minor; a former fellow involved with the University’s 
hospital system; founder of E-MAGINE, bringing Inter-
net access to remote areas in Africa and South America; 
a coach for the club boxing team; the list goes on. But the 
one thing he wants you to know is this: he has struggled 
along the way, has tried to be the most genuine version of 
himself he can be and, above all, he just wants to make a 
difference while he still can.

Nearing his second graduation from the University, he 

says, “This is something special, and this is something 
that I hope others can truly just, like, take a page, see, like, 
if this kid can do it, if this kid can do it … ”

And he can’t even finish the thought. He is so humbled, 

so grateful, so overwhelmed to be recognized for this 
award for a second time, that he cannot find the words 
to express what it all means. That’s OK, Rama. We know.

ver her time on campus, LSA senior Fabiana Diaz has 
realized the necessity of advocating to prevent sexual 
assault, even if she herself isn't fully healed.

“It is a privilege to be able to talk about [sexual assault] and 

advocate for it, because not everyone has that opportunity, 
but at the same time sometimes it can be tiring mentally,” 
Diaz said. “Just because I’m advocating for something doesn’t 
mean I’m completely 100 percent healed. There are moments 
where I still feel like a victim. There are moments where I 
still feel like I need support. But it’s hard because there’s like 
people coming to you for support — you have to learn to bal-
ance it.”

On her second night campus, while at the summer Bridge 

program, she was raped, Diaz said.

“I was so alone," she said. "I was coming here and I didn’t 

know anybody, and because I was in the Bridge program, so 
everybody knew something had happened. People talk.”

She said was told if she took her case to court her assail-

ant would not be prosecuted against, and the process of going 
through questioning would be more draining on her. Diaz, 
who was beginning her freshman year on campus — adjust-
ing to college can already be hard, but the experience made it 
even more isolating.

“I had just started. I just started school,” Diaz said. “I was 

missing class all of the time being called in for questioning — 
whatever it was, it was exhausting. It was a very exhausting 
process, and that just makes it harder. Who would want to go 
through that? I would not want to go through that again.”

She said she had been assured she would not see her assail-

ant in her dorm or classes, but on her first day of class, he was 
there.

Diaz said she stayed quiet about her experience for a long 

time, and it was not until her junior year when the “Carry The 
Weight” march happened on campus she felt comfortable 
speaking out and joining the movement. She began volunteer-
ing at Sexual Assualt Prevention and Awareness Center after 
the march and being open about what happened to her.

“I think that’s when I realized I wasn’t alone: It wasn’t just 

happening to me,” Diaz said. “It was kind of silent on campus; 
I didn’t really know any other survivors at all actually.”

Later that year when “The Hunting Ground” — a documen-

tary on campus sexual assault — was screened at the Michi-
gan Theater, she met activists Andrea Pino and Annie Clark 
who were both survivors of rape while at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill and are the primary subjects 
of the film.

Through Pino and Clark, Diaz was invited to stand onstage 

at the Oscars with Lady Gaga and other victims of sexual 
assault. Diaz said the experience was amazing and marked 
the first time she was surrounded by so many survivors, 
but after she needed to remind people of the reason she was 
there. After receiving many texts from people saying she was 
“lucky” for the experience and wishing they were her, Diaz 
felt compelled to write a piece on the reality of her situation. 

“It was very cathartic to write about that, but it was also 

hard because I don’t want people to think I’m not apprecia-
tive of them,” she said. “I just wanted them to further under-
stand I’m not lucky. I’m not lucky for this opportunity. People 
weren’t understanding, like ‘I’m so jealous’ well, I’ll give it to 
you. I don’t want to be at the Oscars for this reason.”

Being open about being a survivor is often a catch-22 for 

Diaz. In some ways it has been a positive experience which 

has altered the course of her life — she now wants to continue 
activism after graduation — but she does not want people to 
see it as her defining quality.

“People would say: ‘I’m so proud of you.’ They are. I under-

stand why people can be proud of me,” Diaz said. “Why I 
decided to write the article is because I don’t want to be 
proud, and I don’t want other people to be proud of me, for 
what someone else did to my body. I don’t want that to be the 
defining factor; I know that’s not how people see it, but some-
times it’s hard to be the face for this movement because I’m so 
much more than my identity as a survivor.”

Continuing to work with Pino and Clark, Diaz has con-

tributed to writing a book titled “We Believe You: Survivors 
of Sexual Assault” which came out on April 12. In it, she and 
35 other survivors share their story of sexual assault on cam-
pus. Diaz said she wished she had a book like this when she 
was assaulted — seeing it at SAPAC or coming across it in the 
library, Diaz said, would have helped her feel less alone.

Being one of the faces of the sexual assault prevention 

movement is difficult for Diaz at times, but she said it’s neces-
sary.

“It’s hard, but it has to be done,” Diaz said. “It’s hard to 

sometimes be the voice because you don’t want to speak for 
everyone. Survivorhood isn’t just like one all-encompassing 
thing: It’s different for everyone. Everyone has their own 
personal story, their own personal narrative. There might be 
commonalities in the sense that, yeah, our schools are betray-
ing us — there are 160 schools under federal investigation for 
potentially violating Title IX — that’s a national narrative 
that’s happening, but at the same time, our traumas are dif-
ferent, and our traumas don’t define us either.”

Family, faith and friends are what LSA 

senior Brittney Williams credits to her success 
today. The presence of all three has empow-
ered her to overcome her own struggles with 
depression, an ill mother and the academic 
challenges she faced during her time as an 
undergraduate student.

Williams, who began her undergraduate 

odyssey in 2005, acknowledges her path to 
graduation later this month has been atypical 
— but don’t try and convince her that she is not 
representative of the leaders and best.

“For many students here, the typical expe-

rience is that you succeeded, you didn’t face 

that many obstacles, and it can make students 
who have had significant challenges feel badly 
or like they don’t fit in,” Williams said. “But to 
me, what I have gone through, and what other 
people who have faced hardships have gone 
through, is the quintessence of what a victor 
stands for. To be a victor and to be a Wolver-
ine means that you have had to fight to get to 
where you are today.”

Williams had to fight harder than most. 

When she enrolled in the University of Michi-
gan in 2005, she planned on pursuing a degree 
in Political Science. Her first four years at the 
University, however, were less defined by her 

academic ambitions and campus involvement 
than by her battle with depression. Williams’ 
depression became so severe in November 
2009 that she attempted suicide and was hos-
pitalized for five days.

Following the hospitilization, Williams was 

faced with the decision of whether to take time 
off from school to focus on her mental health.

“ I was advised by my advisers, my family 

and my friends to take a semester off to figure 
some things out,” Williams said. “I just kept on 
saying, ‘I’m OK’ and so I kept pushing through. 
I would continue to struggle academically, 
personally, mentally. But some of that was the 
culture that exists here at Michigan that com-
pels you to burn yourself out before you take 
any sort of break.”

Williams continued her studies at the Uni-

versity until 2011, when stress caused her aca-
demic performance to deteriorate until her 
academic suspension at the end of the winter 
semester in 2011.

When she returned home, Williams faced 

her next challenge — caring for her mother, 
who had been diagnosed with early-onset 
Alzheimer’s disease in April 2008.

She became the primary caregiver for her 

mother, whose health was quickly worsening.

“When my mother was diagnosed, I was a 

junior,” Williams said “My siblings were, at the 
time, 17, 11, 10 and 9 years old. So it was really 
rough on everyone in my family, but it was 
the most heartbreaking for the youngest, who 
would later struggle to remember her before 
her disease.”

Her mother passed away on Oct. 11, 2013, 

a day after her sister’s birthday. Williams 
assumed responsibility for all of her mother’s 
funeral arrangements, which took place the 
day after her 25th birthday.

The following May, Williams returned to 

Michigan and re-enrolled at the University. 
When she returned, she said she found the 
place that she left in 2011 had changed in many 
ways: some positive, some negative.

Upon her return, she joined the Central 

Student Government and founded her own 
organization, Michigan Organization of Non-
Traditional Students (MONTS), to give voice 
to other nontraditional students.

“When I came back I had a hard time 

because I was so much older than everyone, 
and I did a focus group where the Center for 
the Education of Women was doing a study on 
nontraditional students,” Williams said. “And 
the focus group had such a great conversation, 
and it led me to want to start a student organi-
zation to bring people like this together.

In her typical “victor” fashion, she embraced 

and overcame these challenges. Later this 
month, Brittney Williams will be graduating 
with her bachelor’s degree in sociology. She 
hopes to attend the University’s graduate pro-
gram in Social Work and pursue a career in 
Alzheimer’s advocacy, using her skills in ger-
ontology to help families — especially children 
— of Alzheimer’s patients receive counseling.

“My goal, down the road is to be lucky 

enough to not have a job,” Williams said. “That 
would mean that we have accomplished our 
goal, and Alzheimer’s will be a thing of the 
past.”

Intercultural understanding has always 

been a topic of high importance on campus 
— as evidenced most recently by conten-
tion over anti-Islam drawings in the Diag. 
Hafsa Ghias, an LSA freshman, wants to 
change that.

“The idea behind this project is to use 

art and creative expression as a way to 
reach out to people and evoke emotion,” 
Ghias said of her creation, The Peace Ini-
tiative.

The Peace Initiative is a project whose 

purpose is to promote understanding 
between cultures through artwork, specif-
ically in regard to dialogue between Mus-
lims and some of the larger groups within 
the nation, a cause which is very personal 
for Ghias.

“My parents are Pakistani, but I was 

born and raised here, so I always see 
myself as a blend of both Pakistani and 
American … that’s played a huge role in my 

life,” Ghias said.

Her experience of growing up as a Mus-

lim in Michigan has played an important 
role in her motivation to start The Peace 
Initiative, but she also is driven by her pas-
sion for art.

“I’ve always been an artist, that’s been 

a huge part of my life,” Ghias said. “And 
growing up wearing the hijab, I did get a 
lot of negative comments … so the way that 
I expressed myself is by creating art.”

The origins of the project started in 

Ghias’s senior year of high school. Prompt-
ed by what she saw as a greater number of 
Islamophobic events happening around 
the world, dehumanizing coverage in the 
media, a feeling of frustration and the 
desire to do something, she started work-
ing on an art portfolio for herself.

“(The portfolio was meant) to creative-

ly show that Muslims were just normal 
people,” Ghias said. “We have all the same 
dreams, passions — we want to be success-
ful, we want to have a family — all that.”

Ghias’s personal art portfolio expanded 

this semester into a larger scale project 
after an encounter with the co-founder of 
optiMize, a social entrepreneurship club at 
the University.

“(optiMize) holds a social innovation 

challenge every year,” Ghias said. “And 
basically what you can do is you can apply 
to this challenge with an idea to change 
the world, and they give you the tools to 
expand on your project.”

Ghias’s organization was able to receive 

financial support from optiMize, and she 
and her four co-founders will be giving a 
presentation about The Peace Initiative at 
optiMize’s showcase on April 13. Though 
the project is not yet complete, Ghias 
intends for there to eventually be a show-
case of all the artwork created for it.

In addition to working with optiMize, 

Ghias intends for The Peace Initiative to 
collaborate with other social justice orga-
nizations around campus.

“We’ve reached out to groups like Lean 

In, the Muslim Students’ Association and 
Hip Hop Congress,” she said. “And we 
want to reach out more to ethnic and reli-
gious groups as well, specific groups that 
work with social justice issues, and work 
with them to use art as a medium to release 
information.”

Ultimately, Ghias wants to use art as a 

means to open up discussion in that same 
way, to promote peace and to help create 
a world that is more open, just and under-
standing.

“I want to use art as a way to be that 

pushing point where people are comfort-
able to ask questions in a positive way, to 
reach out to other people,” Ghias said. “If 
we can use art to make people feel empa-
thy, or make people feel anything honestly, 
it will help to overcome the issues we have 
today.”

Wednesday, April 13, 2016 // The Statement 
 
15B

Despite sitting in Starbucks on a rainy April 

afternoon, LSA junior Yumi Taguchi sported a 
warm smile. This, combined with her big eyes 
and sympathetic tone of voice hinted at why 
she might be such a comfort to students with 
mental health difficulties on campus.

Saying Taguchi is a mental health activist at 

the University of Michigan would be putting 
it mildly. She is involved in four different men-
tal health-related extracurriculars — Active 
Minds, the Wolverine Support Network, the 
Counseling and Psychological Services Stu-
dent Advisory Board and the Depression on 
College Campuses Planning Committee.

Taguchi is most heavily involved in the Uni-

versity’s chapter of Active Minds, a club she 
helped found in 2014 and will be co-director 
of in the 2016-2017 school year. Taguchi said 
when she came to the University, there were 
very few mental health organizations com-
pared to now.

“The interest in mental health maintenance 

has risen so much,” she said. “There are so 
many more mental health organizations on 
campus now. We’re really proud that we get to 
be a part of that.”

Active Mind’s goal is to destigmatize men-

tal health problems on campus by providing 

forums where students are encouraged to 
share their stories, as well as by hosting edu-
cational events.

One such event was Send Silence Packing. 

Last September, students walking to class 
could hardly help but notice the 1,100 back-
packs scattered across the Diag, which were 
meant to represent the number of students 
who commit suicide every year in the United 
States. Taguchi co-planned this event along 
with LSA junior Alexandria Kolenda. 

“The feedback we get from people who 

understand that mental health is something 
that is really important to take care of has been 
tremendous,” Taguchi said.

Sharing stories is something Taguchi cited 

multiple times as an important gateway to 
decreasing the stigma around mental health 
so common on college campuses.

“Through story sharing, you get an idea that 

this is not a problem that one specific group 
might have,” she said. “Everyone has feelings; 
everybody doesn’t feel well sometimes.”

Taguchi has experienced mental health 

issues both personally and peripherally. Her 
two sisters suffered from depression as she 
was growing up, and she suffered from an eat-
ing disorder during high school. Taguchi said 
she often shares her story at different events, 
including the Mental Health Monologues, 
where she performed last year.

“One of the most important things I’ve 

learned is for people to be able to open up to 
you, you have to be willing to open up to them,” 
Taguchi said.

As a student adviser for CAPS, Taguchi also 

has an opportunity to see the more adminis-
trative approach to students’ mental health 
difficulties on campus. She acts as a liaison 
between students and CAPS, and she said the 
role has been eye opening.

“Through active minds you hear a lot of 

things about CAPS — people aren’t as happy 
with CAPS,” Taguchi said. “Now that I’m on the 
CAPS SAB I have more of an appreciation for 
what CAPS does. I realize what the hurdles are 
for CAPS to be able to provide more services.”

These hurdles, Taguchi said, include both 

funding and a lack of available staff members 
to accommodate the high student demand.

“There’s not enough people to actually be 

able to provide these services,” she said. “And 
people cost money.”

With the WSN, Taguchi contributes to 

the creation of weekly safe spaces where 
students can share their troubles. As for her 
involvement in the Depression on College 
Campuses conference, she said she helps 
recruit different types of mental health 
professionals from across the nation to come 
and speak on campus.

Through her participation in so many 

mental health organizations, Taguchi has one 
overarching goal: she wants students to feel 
comfortable.

“Making sure people feel comfortable in 

their own skin, where they are currently, and 
they’re able to make the best out of their every 
day because they feel comfortable,” Taguchi 
said. “That was one of the things that really 
attracted me to an organization like Active 
Minds.”

YUMI TAGUCHI

As diversity committee affairs vice chair in 

LSA Student Government and co-founder of 
Books for a Benefit, Public Policy sophomore 
Nadine Jawad has been at the forefront of 
working to address important societal issues 
for awhile, especially when it comes to lit-
eracy.

When asked about how she spent her Sat-

urday night, Jawad admitted she stayed up 
a little too late — later than she should be — 
reading classics.

“I recently bought 10 new classics because 

I love Oscar Wilde and Ernest Hemingway,” 
she said. “They’re taunting me because I’m 

sitting there doing my homework and they’re 
sitting there and I want to read them so 
badly.”

In just two years at the University, Jawad 

has transformed her love of literature into 
founding BFB — a student organization dedi-
cated to promoting education and literacy in 
at-risk and low socio-economic status com-
munities. Now with five chapters at differ-
ent colleges in Michigan, BFB has expanded 
to provide tutoring services and a pen pals 
program with Syrian refugees to help them 
improve their English. BFB also coordinates 
outreach trips a few times per semester to 

Detroit public schools, where its volunteers 
bring books and backpacks and work with 
students to prepare them for high school and 
college.

BFB began as a book club where college 

students could interact with students in the 
Ann Arbor community, but it has grown into 
something much more.

“We want students to realize how impor-

tant school, education and reading is,” Jawad 
said.

Though her family was not well-off, as a 

young child, Jawad said she was fortunate to 
have parents who took the time to read to her 
and take her to get books and go to the library. 
Thinking back on the support she received 
from her family, Jawad recalled the count-
less times she would wake her mom up at 
midnight frantically asking her what a word 
meant so she could continue to read. Read-
ing became a way for her to overcome hard-
ships she faced in her childhood, and she said 
she wants to provide that opportunity for as 
many children as she can. 

That said, though BFB hopes to start a Flint 

chapter, its goal is not infinite expansion.

“We want to make sure that this isn’t a 

thing where people are trying to build their 
resumes or do it for the wrong reasons,” 
Jawad said. “We want to leave a long-lasting 
impact on the communities. We really value 
quality over quantity.”

When describing BFB, Jawad speaks in 

terms of we want, what we value, underscor-
ing her understanding of the organization 

as a collaborative effort. Despite being a co-
founder — the concept of BFB was her idea — 
when talking about the organization, Jawad 
consistently emphasizes that it hasn’t been 
just her. The board of BFB in particular has 
been a driving force in the organization’s suc-
cess and expansion, she said.

“What is most rewarding is not only see-

ing the impact on students we serve but also 
on the volunteer side, seeing people who are 
equally — if not more — passionate about the 
cause than I am.”

Despite the largely rewarding experiences 

she’s had through BFB, Jawad is still ground-
ed in reality, asking herself hard questions.

“Issues are so systemic. When you’re at a 

school, you ask, ‘are you really doing anything 
for these kids? Books, backpacks, do they 
make a difference?’ ” she said. “Giving them 
a book isn’t going to change the fact that they 
are poor, or the fact that their mom’s single or 
the fact that no one pays taxes and they’re so 
poor, so their education system sucks.”

Jawad believes that enacting change it is 

not only about tapping into what you are pas-
sionate about, but also realizing what the root 
cause of the problem is.

“People on this campus are so social justice-

oriented,” she said. “But it’s not just about doing 
what you’re interested in, it’s also realizing the 
root causes of these issues, and poor education 
is a root cause of many issues, whether they 
concern medicine, law or policy.”
