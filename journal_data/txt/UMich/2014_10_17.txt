Decision comes as
part of a series of
requests by CSG
By CLAIRE BRYAN
and MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporters
FLINT, Mich. - Following
Thursday's University Board of
Regents meeting in Flint, the
Athletic Department officially
agreed to a set of policy recom-
mendations made by the Central
Student Government - namely
slashing prices for football stu-
dent season tickets. The 2015
sason prices will be unveiled
next week.
"Michigan Athletics looks
forward to forging a strong rela-
tionship with Central Student
Government," Athletic Director
Dave Brandon said in a state--
ment Thursday night. "This is an
important relationship to us; one
that we need to repair, and one
that will provide mutual support
among all students."
University athletics were at
the center of discussion during
the regents meeting. CSG Presi-
dent Bobby Dishell, a Public Pol-
icy senior, gave a presentation to
the regents and said he negotiat-
ed numerous verbal agreements
with the Athletic Department
based on the results of a CSG sur-

vey distributed Oct. 10.
The survey, which aimed to
assess student experience at
Michigan football games and the
student body's relationship with
the Athletic Department, closed
Tuesday evening with a total of
5,208 responses - roughly 12
percent of the University student
body.
"These past few weeks have
been a troubling time for Michi-
gan students," Dishell said dur-
ing his report to the regents.
"Difficulty in regard to the foot-
ball program, focused primarily
within ..pe Athletic Department's
administration, have made many
students wary of the very thing
that has united them with alum-
ni, family and city residents for
over a century."
He added that current tick-
eting prices have caused a rift
in students' perception of the
Athletic Department, and more
concretely, in many students'
ability and willingness to physi-
cally attend games.
"In one word, students
described the current program
as disappointing, corporate, bad
and embarrassing,". he said of
the survey during his presenta-
tion. "Before coming to the Uni-
versity, students said the word
they would have used to describe
Michigan football was 'tradi-
tion'."

Former Secretary
of State comes as
elections approach
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
ROCHESTER, Mich. - A
week after First Lady Michelle
Obama visited the state in a get-

out-the-vote push for Demo--
crats, Hillary Clinton, former
Secretary of State and former
First Lady, spoke at a Democrat-
ic rally at Oakland University's
athletics center, the, O'Rena,
Thursday evening to deliver a
similar message.
Clinton visited Michigan
to campaign for Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Mark
Schauer and U.S. Rep. Gary

Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.),
who is the Democratic candi-
date for U.S Senate. Schauer is
currently trailing incumbent
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder in
the latest polls by 3.5 percent-
age points, within the margin
of error. Peters, running for the
first open Michigan U.S Senate
seat in 20 years, enjoys a slightly
less tight race, leading his oppo-
nent Terri Lynn Land (R) by 9

points. During the upcoming
midterm elections in Michigan,
Democrats need to turn out vot-
ers to win, Clinton said.
"You know, midterm elec-
tions, not as many people come
out to vote," Clinton told the
crowd. "You never can tell
what's going to happen in an
election. You can't take any-
thing for granted. You just have

The 2014 MSAN Student

Taylor looks to change
zoning for development

I

Mayoral candidate
outlines plans for
building regulations
SByEMMA KERR
Daily StaffReporter
- If elected this November,
Democratic mayoral candidate
Christopher Taylor has said he
plans to initiate changes in zoning
and to further regulate the kinds
of buildings constructed in Ann
Arbor's downtown area if he is
elected mayor in the general elec-
tion this November..
Developmenthasbeen aheavily
discussed topic inthe mayoral race
thus far and a key issue among the
four candidates in the Democratic
mayoral nomination during the
August primary.
Following the crowded primary
in which Taylor garnered a near
majority of the vote as the Demo-

cratic candidate, his name will
appear next to Bryan Kelly's on
the general election ballot. Kelly,
an independent candidate, entered
the race with an emphasis on
downtown development as well,
suggesting Ann Arbor maintain its
green, small-town feel.
The recent increase in the rate
of downtown development in
Ann Arbor has increased tensions
between developers and residents,
and has raised the question of
what type of city its leaders hope
it will become. Specifically, the
development issue regards high-
rise apartments that predomi-
nantly house University students.
One development decision
made in January - the approval
of the construction of a building
located at 413 E. Huron St. - was
heavily debated preceding its
approval, and continues to be a
pivotal issue in this mayoral race.
On his campaign website, Tay-
lor, who gave the deciding vote in

p--p

approving the site plan, calls the
413 E. Huron St. decision "a stark
reminder we need to do better."
The case was characterized as a
lose-lose situation. Councilmem-
bers were caught between facing
a possible lawsuit if they were to
reject the construction of the 413
E. Huron St. building, which was
zoned for such a building and
therefore legal, yet some council-
members and residents felt the
construction would be unattract-
ive and obtrusive.
"I think that the 413 E. Huron
building showed we did not get the
zoning right in that location," Tay-
lor said in an interview with The
Michigan Daily. "We've seen alotof
blocky buildings lately, and I think
people want density downtown and
people want commercial activity
downtown, but they don't like the
way a lot of our new buildings look."
Taylor said, as mayor, he would
take several actions in response
to residents' disapproval of
recent downtown development.
These actions include seeking to
reevaluate zoning throughout
the downtown area, determining
the potential for certain kinds of
buildings and improvements - as
well as the possible consequences
of every building design and con-
struction opportunity - and mak-
ing zoning changes preemptively
when necessary.
He said the general zoning
has served the city well, but only
needs minor adjustments to avoid
incidents like the 413 E. Huron St.
decision and to better meet the
needs of citizens.
"We need to make sure the zon-
ing downtown is proper," Taylor
said. "I don't, however, think our
zoning needs wholesale overhaul."
The process of development
approval includes the approval and
consideration of the Design Review
Board and the Planning Commis-
sion, the members of which are
both chosen by the mayor before
being presented to City Council.

he would make as mayor would

Delta Tau Lambda
brings speakers to
discuss social justice
By TANYA MADHANI
Daily StaffReporter
Drawing attendees from
pcross the state, Delta Tau
Lambda, a Latina sorority at the
University, hosted its 21st annu-
al "Salute to Latinas" event in
the Michigan League Ballroom.
The event aimed to unite
women regardless of their
social and cultural identities
by providing an atmosphere of
empowerment. The night fea-
tured keynote speeches from
prominent social justice activ-
ists in the state.
"We hope that our audience
takes away that while they
might experience something
thdy may not be knowledgeable
about, (they will hear) experi-
ences of another woman and to
be a little more open minded,"
said LSA senior Wendy Cortes,
an event coordinator.
Cortes said she often sees cul-
tural events on campus being pro-
moted by a single diversity group

as opposed to several collaborating
on a larger multicultural event.
"Instead of minority groups
unifying to reach the shared
goal, they kind of separate each
other, and there is a lot of bias.
In my personal opinion I think
there could be a lot more prog-
ress made if groups unified,"
Cortes said.
Though the event was put on
by a Latina sorority, the audi-
ence included attendees of all
genders and ethnicities. Fel-
low Multicultural Greek Coun-
cil members, such as Kappa
Phi Lambda, an Asian-interest
sorority, also attended.
"We like to show up and sup-
port other Greek orgs within
our MGC ... We like to support
each other by showing up to
each of our events," said LSA
senior Rosy Liao, a Kappa Phi
Lambda member.
Ida Lu, another member of
Kappa Phi Lambda, had attend-
ed the event in the past.
"We just want to support the
other Greek organizations and
also learn about the culture and
spread awareness about differ-
ent cultures," Lu said. "Last year
it was in a different environ-

ment, so I'm excited to see what
they have this year."
The keynote speaker for the
event was artist and hip-hop
dancer Piper Carter, who talked
about the importance of people
sharing their own stories and
being able to share them.
"People of color are taught
that our existence is not valu-
able," Carter said.
Carter narrated her child-
hood in New York City, where,
despite being African American,
she lived in a predominantly
Puerto Rican neighborhood and
attended a Jewish school. As she
recounted anecdotes from her
upbringing, several Puerto Rican
audience members clapped and
agreed out loud with similarities
in their own upbringing.
One particular story Carter
told was of how her Puerto
Rican babysitter would give her
a warm milk and sugar bever-
age- a childhood memory still
stays with her today.
"And what's important
about that is ritual and family,"
Carter said. "How many of you
went back and felt really good?
Wasn't that like the best thing?

FOOTBALL
From Page 1A
"The survey showed that we've
reached a tipping point," Dishell
said after the meeting. "Students
said no more. To notice that if you
would have just barely over 10
percent of your over 12,000 stu-
dent section buying tickets again
... that's-not a pretty number."
Subsequently, Dishell said he
and Brandon had agreed on the
reduction of football student sea-
son ticket prices (the recommen-
dation is no more than $150), the
elimination of rental fees at ath-
letics facilities for student organi-
zations with charitable aims, the
creation of new student advisory
boards and regular student meet-
ings with Brandon.
The Athletic Department con-
firmed these stipulations in its
release Thursday night, adding
its commitment to hold monthly
meetings between Brandon and
students to "address topics relat-
ing to all 31 teams and Michigan
Athletics."
The statement also established
the initiative to work with the Big
Ten to create a blackout week-
end where Crisler Center will be
available for MUSIC Matters in
2016. MUSIC Matters is a student
organization that annually brings
in an end-of-year concert per-
former, in addition to facilitating
SpringFest, which spotlights the
work of other student organiza-
tions and local talent.
Other recommendations in
the report that were not verbally
agreed upon with the Athletic
Department included offering
free concessions for students
who attend the game on time
and expanding the men's basket-
ball student section in the lower
bowl.
Regent Andrea Fischer New-
man (R) expressed discontent
with the survey's rate of respons-
es following Dishell's presenta-
tion at the regents meeting and
said 12 percent was not represen-
tative of the entire student body.
"I think (Dishell) is doing a
goodjoboftryingtoworkwiththe
students and the administration
and the Athletic Department,"
Newman said in an interview
after the-meeting. "(But) I was_
disappointed that it represented
only 12 percent of students."
Dishell also responded to this
concern after the meeting.
"Anyone who has done market
research, anyone who has done
statistical, social science sur-
veys ... 12 percent is an incredible

response rate," he said. "And we
also saw that, on these surveys,
when we looked at last year's
CSG surveys, the behaviors that
came out of this response rate are
reflective of the student popula-
tion."
For some administrators, stu-
dents and regents, these policy
changes were only the tip of the
iceberg when examining internal
issues with the Athletic Depart-
ment.
University President Mark
Schlissel opened the regents
meeting with a prepared state-
ment in which he touted the role
of athletics in all facets of the
University community. However,
he also said the Athletic Depart-
ment must reinvigorate its role in
facilitating the safety of student
athletes.
"We have a very passionate
community that cares deeply
about our wonderful athletic tra-
dition as well as the sense of con-
nectedness our programs have
long provided for us," he said. "I
value that connection highly and
want to preserve and enhance it."
He then he addressed the
muddled actions taken regarding
sophomore quarterback Shane
Morris, who was put back into
the Sept. 27 football game against
Minnesota shortly after likely
sustaining a concussion.
"I was deeply disappointed in
the department's initial response
in handling the situation," Schlis-
sel said. "We must be accountable
for the facts with a response that
is timely and takes responsibility
for error. Without this we break
trust with our stakeholders."
Investigation of this mistake
following the game yielded con-
flicting messages from Brandon
and Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
Schlissel noted the University
has made several policy changes
since the Minnesota game, such
as placing a trainer in the press
box with instant replay access
and two-way radio communica-
tion with medical staff on the
sidelines, as well as reinforcing
the practice of taking away the
helmets of injured athletes.
He has also instructed the Ath-
letic Department to conduct a full
review of in-game player safety
procedures. The review is being
conducted bythe department and,
findings and recommendations
will be shared with the regents
and public at appropriate times.
He said the University will
need more extensive, long-term
approaches to address additional
issues.
"We work to establish the right

balance between competitive-
ness, financial stability and the
athletic traditions we hold dear,"
Schlissel said.
Zeid El-Kilani, a Public Policy
graduate student, spoke dur-
ing the public comments portion
of the meeting and said that all
moves beingtaken to appease the
student body - both with regard
to safety and commercialization
- fail to address the overarching-
ly negative atmosphere created by
the Athletic Department admin-
istration. ,
El-Kilani authored the CSG
petition to fire Brandon in the
first week of October, which has
since amassed more than 11,000
signatures.
Analysis conducted by The
Michigan Daily two weeks ago
revealed that the majority of
these signatures were alumni, not
current students.
"We are nauseated by the dou-
blespeak, public relations gap,
and outright contempt that ema-
nate from the Athletic Depart-
ment," El-Kilani said during his
speaking time. "It is clear that
change is necessary. That is why
I, and more than 11,000 other stu-
dents and alumni, respectfully
request the University relieve Mr.
Brandon of his duties as Athletic
Director."
Despite some media specula-
tion, Brandon's job security was
not a topic of conversation at
the regents meeting. El-Kilani
said there were "underlying cul-
tural issues" which would not be
addressed by the current policy
changes atplay.
Even if Brandon's job had been
discussed, firingpowerultimately
lies with Schlissel. Otherwisethe
regents' only role in personnel
oversight is selecting the Univer-
sity president.
"I think (the Athletic Depart-
ment) sees its role as overseer
of the whole Michigan brand,
including everything to do with
how the public perc'eives our Uni-
versity," El-Kilani said. "But in
reality, they're a tool for fostering
community on campus, engag-
ing our students and alumni and
bringing us all together. But I
think they've lost track of that."
Regent Mark Bernstein (D)
alluded to this issue in conver-
sations with the media after the
meeting came to a close.
He said "the board is working
in partnership with our president
to make a thoughtful, deliberate,
responsible decision," and added
that, "this personnel matter is a
delicate matter that is important
to discuss with our president."

CLINTON
From Page 1A
to get out there and work for it.
And trust me, you don't want to
wake up the day after the elec-
tion and wish you would have
done more."
As candidates for state office
took the stage preceding Clin-
ton's remarks, they also spoke on,
voter turnout - a common theme
for Democrats this election year.
In the 2012 presidential elec-
tion, President Barack Obama
won Michigan by 9.5 percentage
points but during midterm elec-
tions Republicans have typically
had an advantage.
"Elections have consequenc-
es," Southfield Mayor Brenda
Lawrence, candidate for the U.S
House of Representatives, told
the crowd. "And I will tell you,
four years ago, many of you in
this room did not vote. You just
sat it out. You said 'Oh, he's a
nerd. How bad can it be?' I don't
think I can tell that to anyone
now."
Lawrence was referring to
Snyder, who ran on the slogan of
'one tough nerd' in his 2010 elec-
tion. Her message was echoed by
U.S. Rep. Sandy Levin (D-Royal
Oak), whose brother, Senator
Carl Levin's (D-Mich.) retire-
ment has led to the state's open
Senate seat.
"You can sum it up this way,"
Levin said. "2016 can wait.
And that's especially true as
to who's going to be the sena-

tor. My brother ... he's up North
campaigning for this ticket and
we owe him gratitude. He never
gives up fighting. This is what all
of us face; who's going to carry on
his work of 36 years?"
"We can do much better than
we did in 2010, and we're going to
do it in the year 2014," he added.
During her remarks, beyond
urgingthe crowd to vote, Clinton
also touched on several specific
policy issues, grouping objec-
tives like pay equity, healthcare
and strengthening the middle
class under the theme of being
pro-family. She cited General
Motors CEO Mary Barra, who
spoke at the University's Spring
2014 Commencement, as a
woman taking hold of a leader-
ship position.
"Let us remember, this is the
state where Rosie the Riveter
inspired a country," Clinton said
on pay equity. "You now have
leaders like Mary Barra cracking
ceilings, showing there's no job a
woman can't do. So just ask your-
self - why is it that women still
get paid less than a man for doing
the same work?"
She spoke extensively on the
auto bailout, which has been
a contentious issue this elec-
tion cycle in Michigan. Peters
has emphasized his support for
the bailout repeatedly during
the campaign - Land, up until
this month, has not, something
Peters has criticized.
"(Schauer and Peters) decid-
ed to take the risk, stand with
President Obama, roll up their

sleeves and get to work," Clin-
ton said. "Now, there are some
choices that define careers and
define what people are made
out of. There are choices that
shape your whole life. This was
a choice that would change the
future of an industry atstake and
a nation."
While Clinton did not men-
tion her plans for 2016 - she has
been rumored to be a possible
candidate for the Democratic
nomination for U.S. President
- during the event, many can-
didates alluded to it, also telling
the crowd that a large Democrat-
ic turnout in 2014 would build a
strong basis for Clinton in 2016.
"I'm so proud that she's got
my back today," Schauer said
in his introduction to Clinton's
remarks. "And whatever the
future holds for you, Madam
Secretary, I will always be on
Team Hillary."
After the event, Oakland Uni-
versity freshmen Aaron Decarie
and Jenna Russell, who will be
first-time voters in this year's
midterm election, said Clinton's
speech had been inspiring.
"It lets you know that your
votes matter, and it can help
(them) win," Russell said.
Michigan will see at least two
more national figures before
Election Day - Clinton's hus-
band, former President Bill Clin-
ton, is expected to rally for state
Democrats Wednesday in Flint,
and President Obama is expected
to visit the state in the week lead-
ing up to the Nov. 4 election.


SNYDER
From Page1A
The city had reached that point,
and Snyder said he had no choice
but to tap bankruptcy lawyer
Kevyn Orr, a University alum,
to the position. Soon after, Orr
filed for municipal bankruptcy
for Detroit, making it the largest
U.S. city ever to do so.
Snyder marveled at the pace of
progress the city has made in the
18 months since Orr's appoint-
ment. He said the Plan of Adjust-
ment, which outlines how the city
will restructure debt and city ser-
vices in bankruptcy, had earlier
that day received approval from
the city's last major creditor and
was now just a month or so away
from court approval. Snyder said
he owed most of the credit to
Orr, Mayor Mike Duggan and the
judges and mediators involved in
the bankruptcy process.
In addition to those leaders,
Snyder said he is also indebted to
the city's retirees for their role in
supporting the so-called "grand
bargain." This plan addressed
the controversy over the bank-
ruptcy's effect of freeing the

city from its obligation to pay
retired city employees the full
cost of their pension they were
promised. The centerpiece of the
adjustment plan will give the city
$816 million over 20 years to help
reduce pension cuts, with funds
comingfromthe state, nonprofits
and the Detroit Institute of Arts.
Snyder noted that as the bank-
ruptcy has gone on, the city has
made strides in other areas. He
said the city is now better lit,
trash is being picked up more fre-
quently, blighted buildings con-
tinue to be removed and crime
has gone down significantly. In
addition, Snyder highlighted that
the residential areas in midtown
and downtown have a 95-percent
occupancy rate. Still, the city
faces significant challenges in
these areas.
With that in mind, Snyder also
made an appeal to the audience
of mostly law students about con-
sidering living in Detroit, citing
its great employment opportuni-
ties and affordability.
"In your lifetime, how many
chances will you have to be on
ground floor of bringing some-
thing back that most people
thought, wasn't going to come

back?" he asked.
In a Michigan Daily survey
from earlier this month, only 22
percent of surveyed University
students saidthey would consider
living in the city after graduation.
Law student Timothy Gar-
cia, who attended the lecture,
appreciated how the governor
addressed the problems the city
needed to fix while also playing
up its exciting potential.
"I was surprised, actually, that
he came to Ann Arbor in the mid-
dle of campaign season," Garcia
said. "I'm really glad he did."
Though Snyder did not men-
tion the campaign explicitly, he
did talk about his role in Detroit
in broader terms, noting that
while being the face of a historic
bankruptcy might create a nega-
tive perception, it will be a good
thing in the end.
"I don't think about legacy,
but when they write the history
books, it'll say, 'Governor Rick
Snyder was the one who put
Detroit into bankruptcy'," Sny-
der said. "That will be a good
thing. Because otherwise the day
after, the day after that and the
day after that would be the worst
in the history of Detroit."


DIVERSITY
From Page 1A
mittee released a report detailing
several potential changes, includ-
ing the creation of a strategic plan
for diversity.
"I look forward to being able
to present new strategies to the
regents and the entire Michigan
communitylater this year,"he said.
He also said the University is
continuing to meet with members
of the University's Black Student
Union.
"These ongoing discussions are
resulting in very productive con-
sultations," he said.
Discussions with the adminis-
tration and members of the Black
Student Union earlier in the year
resulted in a renovation of the
Trotter Multicultural Center while
the administration continues to
search for a new space for a new
multicultural center.
Schlissel noted that two recent
University appointees, Robert
Sellers, the vice provost for equity,
inclusion and academic affairs,
and Kendra Ishop, associate vice
president for enrollment manage-
ment, have assumed their roles and
started developing new approaches
toaddressminorityenrollmentand
campus climate.
He also cited the University's
Change It Up campaign, which
helps students to develop the skills
to intervene when they see or hear
behavior that is harmful to the
campus climate, and the Inclu-
sive Language Campaign kicked
off, which kicked off in Septem-
ber, as examples of new programs

designed to address inclusion.
Regents approve three capital.
projects
The regents also approved three
facilities-related projects, includ-
ing the naming of the new Ross
School Academic Building as Jeff
T. Blau Hall. Blau, a Business alum,
currently serves on the Ross School
Advisory Board. In 2006, he made
a$4milliondollargiftandthisyear
he made an additional $5 million
gift to the Business School.
The regents also approved reno-
vations at the Institute of Continu-
ing Legal Education. The 9,000
gross square feet first floor renova-
tions will remodel existing offices,
create a conference room and
improve heating, ventilation and
electrical improvements. The total
cost of the project is $1.75 million.
Renovations to the Michigan
Memorial Project Laboratory were
also approved. The 2,700 gross-
square-foot renovation plan will
convert an office space into a state
of the art laboratory for creating
prototype batteries.
Regents receive annual invest-
ment report
Douglas Strong, the University's
interim executive vice president
and chief executive officer, pre-
sented the regents with an annual
report on the University's invest-
ments.
The University's endowment
has grown to $9.7 billion in fiscal
year 2014, up from $8.4 million in
2013, making it the eighth largest
endowment fund among American
universities.
According to the report, the
University's fiscal year 2014 invest-
ment return was 18.8 percent.

That figure is up 10.7 percent from
last year. Strong said the increase
could be attributed, in part, to new
donor gifts as part of the Victors for
Michigan fundraising campaign,
which was launched last year.
This report marks the fourth
year of double-digit investment
returns over the past five years.
"This is an indication that
markets, in general, have fully
recovered from the impact of the
financial crisis and the economy
is finally emerging from the sub-
sequent Great Recession," Erik
Lundberg, the University's chief
investment officer, wrote in a
release.
However, lower rates could be
on the horizon.
"While strong. -investment
returns are welcome, such positive
performance appropriately needs
to be tempered by the recognition
that high current returns usually
beget lower future returns as mar-
kets often get ahead of underlying
fundamentals," he wrote.
In fiscal year 2014, the Univer-
sity's endowment funded $283
million in operating expenses, an
increase of $7 million over last
year. The University distributes 4.5
percent of its endowment value for
operations.
In an endowment, the principal
funds are typically left intact, but
the organization often taps into
investment proceeds for needs
such as operating expenses. The
report notes $2 billion is set aside
for student scholarships, for exam-
ple.

CONFERENCE
From Page 1A
ting racism in schools.
The dialogue training was
held among students in a very
full Union Ballroom, with stu-
dents sitting at round tables. The
students were unafraid to share
their thoughts, and there was a
steady flow of student input com-
ing through the speakers as each
student spoke through the micro-
phone. Roger Fisher, associate
director of Intergroup Relations,
spent time passionately leading
the discussion, encouraging stu-
dents to be leaders against racism
in their own classrooms.
"There's a difference between
a rebellion and a revolution,"
Fisher said, addressingthe room.
"A rebellion is just acting out. It's
throwing one real good orga-
nized fit. It's having a tantrum.
Revolution requires change. It
requires strategy. It requires
commitment, intelligence - all
these other things. We have to
decide, am I committed to just
a good old-fashioned tear down
the walls rebellion, or am I com-
mitted to a revolution?"
Walking out of the ballroom,
Farmington High School junior
Margaret Kohler expressed
anxiety about missing a day of
school. With a 4.0 GPA and a
self-described privileged back-
ground, Kohler admits she is
on the high end when it comes

to achievement. Even so, she is
dedicated to raising awareness
about the disparities of achieve-
ment associated with race, and
this was her third year in a row
attending a conference of this
type.
"I could name 20 people who
never talk about this stuff,"
Kohler said. "If we don't do it no
one else will."
Kohler said she has seen an
achievement gap at her school,
and to combat it, students of
different races need to interact
more with one another.
"Farmington High School
in our district has the biggest
achievement gap, and I think
that's super connected to this
whole diversity thing and race
cliques," Kohler said. "I think if
students were to mesh more with
students who aren't like them,
then you'd definitely see lessen-
ing of the achievemefit gap."
This point came up again and
againat the conference - greater
integration between students of
different races makes it easier
to combat the stereotypes asso-
ciated with race. Hafner said
some students feel pressured by
the "mythical" benchmarks for
academic success that have been
constructed for students of their
particular race.
"I think that's where that
comes from, the myth that if
you're smart and you're Black,
you're acting white, or the ste-
reotype that certain groups of
people aren't intelligent," she

said. "I think some kids live into
that expectation placed on them,
and some work really hard to
fight against it."
Still, each student had individ-
ual experiences in their school
and not all of them had witnessed
or experienced directly racial
issues.
Darryl Dunlap, a student at
North Farmington High School,
said he has not personally run
into conflicts with peers or
teachers, but that he has friends
who have told him they feel held
back by their race.
"I wouldn't say my race has
ever held me back; generally I
would say all my teachers like
me," Dunlap said. "Some of my
Asian friends may not be as
smart as they're made out to be,
and they struggle sometimes too,
even though people usually think
they're smart."
Dunlap was on the volun-
teer committee at the confer-
ence, meaning he is one of the
students trusted with helping
to make sure everything runs
smoothly. Last year, Dunlap
attended the 2013 MSAN confer-
ence in Massachusetts. He said
his experiences with the national
conference have been inspiring.
"When I first went last year, I
was kind of like, this is a chance
for me to get out of school," he
said. "But then once you get
into the topics of discussion, it's
an eye-opener. You actually see
what is going on and how you can
help change things."

in and consider developmentoppor-

In addition, he said he plans on
having a more balanced plan for

the kinds of buildings constructed
downtown.
This kind of variety in devel-
opment, Taylor said, will include
employment centers downtown
and possibilities other than resi-
dential buildings, which the city's
zoning currentlytends to favor.
This variety could, as public
speakers at City Council meet-

ings in the past have consistent-
ly advocated for, include more
affordable housing. Affordable
housing has been another major
concern throughout the elec-
tion, though the construction of
affordable housing facilities does
not rest directly on City Council.

Breaking the silence
Clear communication is crucial if CSG is to connect with campus
The Central Student Government voted down a proposed
resolution on Oct. 7 to condemn the killing of Michael
Brown and to stand in solidarity with the protestors of
Ferguson, Missouri. Michael Brown was a Black teenager who,
though unarmed, was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson
in Ferguson. In response to his death, the protesting citizens
of Ferguson were met with forceful police action of various
forms including tear gas and detainment. This has lead to a
national debate on police militarization and legal treatment

Restoring the roar ofDetroit

have a bad history of being a
fan of losing sports teams. The
Detroit Tigers didn't post a
winning season
for the first 13
years of my life. I
inherited fandom
for the Chicago
Cubs, who haven't
won a World
Series since
1908, from my
dad. Somewhere DAVID
in there I was HARRIS
able to fit in the
Detroit Lions. I
promise I still had a good childhood
regardless.
Eventually there comes a point
where the losing is embraced -
specifically on t-shirts. Though
the greatest shirt in Detroit sports
history will always be one that
reads, "DON KELLY TAUGHT
MEGATRON EVERYTHING HE
KNOWS" (there really isn't a need
for explanation there, it's official
dogma of the Church of Detroit
Sports), perhaps the most enduring
one to describe the past three-
quarters of a century is a Detroit
Lions shirt thathas allthe design and
makings of a conference champions
shirt but instead of "Conference
Champions" reads "Conference
Participants." This shirt has become
my go-to apparel for all important
sports games in which the Lions are
participating in, as well as the games
they are not. And one of those games
the Lions have been guaranteed not
to play in: the Super Bowl.
One thing stays consistent
at every Super Bowl party: the
constant making fun of the Lions
fan in the room. Trash talking is

inevitably part of sports culture, but
there's a special sadness from the
soul of any football fan for the Lions;
it's simply no fun to make fun of a
team that has won nothing. So when
the Red Hot Chili Peppers took the
stage for the half time show at the
Super Bowl earlier this year and
their drummer, Chad Smith, who
grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Mich,
had an insignia of the Lions logo
(among other teams) on his drum
set, everyone said, "Look! The Lions
finally made it to the Super Bowl!"
Somewhere during the Seahawks'
43-8 victory over the Broncos the
attention shifted from the game out-
come to the various 25-cent bets we
would make on the game (Will Pete
Carroll be chewing gum in the 3rd
quarter? Over-under on number of
times Peyton Manning says "Omaha"
on this drive: 7) and even Super Bowl
Bingo. Eventually someone asked
me, "Hey David, would you rather
have the Lions continue to not make
the Super Bowl, or make it and get
obliterated like the Broncos?"
It's an easy answer: of course I'd
rather see the Lions make it all the
way than fall short of glory. But
somewhere that question highlights
a deeper perspective.
Somehow missing field goal after
field goal to start the season still
hurts even when you've become
numb to the losses and feelings of
sports heartbreak no longer register.
Somehow every year restores the
confidence that "this is our year,"
with no bearing given to past results.
Theunofficial sloganofthe Lionsfor
the past 50 years has been "Restore
the Roar." It's still the slogan this
year, and it's possible it will be next
year too. But nobody thinks about

next year yet, because just maybe
this is the year.
Somewhere in the seemingly
endless despair the Lions have
apparently become a microcosm of
the city of Detroit. Not only has its
footballteambeen comicallylabeled
as participants, Detroit has lacked
any description of a "winning" city.
It flirts with escape, yet continually
toils in depression, stuck in an age
it can't seem to escape. But there
persists the attitude that the Roar of
Detroit too will be restored.
For the past few years, Ford Field
has been one of the loudest stadiums
in the NFL. It has no name for its fans
like the "12th MAN" of the Seattle
Seahawks or the "cheeseheads" of
the Green Bay Packers. The fans at
Ford Field are nothing more than a
bunch of Honolulu-blue-clad people
with tickets who show up to support
a football team.
So too are the people of Detroit.
There's no collective identity that
defines a Detroiter, no classification
of who the citizens of Detroit are.
They are simply people. And when
a lot of people get together for the
same cause, theymake alotofnoise.
Gov. Rick Snyder said during the
gubernatorial election debate last
week that, "Detroit never had a
brighter future." The Lions haven't
won a Super Bowl yet. Detroit still
has its myriad of problems. But
the bright future of the city shines
through. Its people show up time
and time again for the city because
just maybe this is the year not
just for our football team, but for
our city.

of minorities.
The CSG resolution was proposed Sept. 16
and then postponed from a Sept. 23 meeting
to last Tuesday. Though three amendments
were passed, the overall resolution was
ultimately rejected. It's reasonable to assume
that the extensive scope of political and legal
complexities and unknowns surrounding the
events in Ferguson fall outside of the CSG's
capacity and role on campus. However, a
lack of explanation from CSG has caused an
outrage amongst members of the student
body, who are questioning the rationale
behind the decision.
Regardless of whether or not the resolution
should have been passed, CSG has begun to
demonstrate a patterned failure to clearly
communicate with students, a key factor in
public backlash and anger. Following the
rejection of last Tuesday's resolution to stand
in solidarity with the people of Ferguson,
little to no public explanation was offered
for the decision. Similarly, in March 2014,
a lack of official explanation or statement
was offered following CSG's decision to
table a high profile resolution backed by
Students Allied for Freedom and Equality.
The resolution called for the University to
divest its interests in companies accused of
violating human rights of Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza. CSG initially decided to
permanently table the resolution without any
clear justification. This resulted ina response
from hundreds of students, including
members of SAFE and its supporters to have

a sit-in at the Michigan Union in protest.
In addition to these incidents, while
the CSG website does provide detailed
minutes of Student Assembly meetings, it
only lists meetings up to April 2014. After
cross checking with documented Student
Assembly minutes, it appears that the most
current resolution posted on the website is
from February 2014.
Passing down judgment and decisions
without a clear explanation leaves the rest
of the student body in the dark. Rejected
resolutions receive little feedback and thus no
direction for how to edit, rewrite or proceed
with their championed cause. Unexplained
rejections or approvals of resolutions create
a sense of randomness to the process, as few
people outside the Student Assembly and
CSG understand the underlying logic.
Though members of the Central Student
Government shouldn't be expected to give
individual explanations, after each vote over
a resolution a spokesperson for the majority
opinion in the Student ;Assembly should
consider providing a statement for why they
came to their decision. This would allow for
increased transparency and could provide
the student body with closure and allow for
improvements to rejected resolutions.
In general, there have at times been a
relative disconnect between the student
body and CSG that needs to be mended, and
CSG can begin this process by improving
communication.

Embracing our differences

Acceptance not tolerance

Cultural dances can be deeply rooted
into an individual's past, becoming
a part of their childhood memories
and adult lifestyles. Even
on a busy and modern
campus like Michigan,
there are still those that
embrace their heritage and
share it with the rest of us.
I had a chance to talk with -
Howie Magaro, co-captain
and choreographer for the SARA
Michigan Bhangra Team, SIHAMASKIN
to see how his group has
become a part of campus
while still holding true to
the customary basis.
Bhangra is a Desi-originated dance,
meaning it arose from Pakistani, Indian and
Bangladeshi culture. The dance was originally
meant to celebrate the harvest season, with
different elements to represent the farming,
growing and reaping of the crops. Since
then, the dance has become an international
performance, inspiring competitions
throughout college campuses and large
conferences. Magaro tells me that the
perception of Indian dance is quite skewed,
for many immediately think of Bollywood,
and that the go-to thought of regular dancing
today is only ina modern style.
"When we think of dance, we think very
narrowly, in terms of either hip hop or some
type of Latino dance like salsa. Nobody really
knows of or has been exposed to the Indian
types of dance. It is very exciting to watch,"
said Magaro.
Though the dance's popularization has
vastly increased over the past forty years,
there are still several ties that allow the
meaning and integrity of the Desi cultures
to shine through. Whether it be by means of
dances like "'Fasla' that represent the wheat
going back and forth with with your arms," or
with the traditional dress like thepaagturban,
the turla headpiece or the salwar kameez
harem pants. These clothes, though old in
tradition, are now put into a modern concept
in order to be showcased in performances.
For those outside of the Desi farming
culture,it'simportant toview the displayofthe
traditional Bhangra dance, clothing and props

to learn about what has been so ingrained into
this society. By understanding, and in turn
appreciating, another's cultural practices,
tolerance disappears and acceptance takes its
place. Tolerance doesn't allow us to open our
minds to experience how others may interpret
events, such as a harvest. But acceptance
enables us to willingly compare and contrast
our own events, bridging one's own culture
with another's.
Too many times has tolerance been viewed
as a progressive moment, as if we are allowing
some other person with values different than
ours to continue on, unopposed by us. This
isn't a way in which people of varying cultures
- especially on a college campus - should be
interacting with other students. We should
have acceptance be our goal, not tolerance.
Acceptance allows the playing field to be even.
If there is a discrepancy, a rift begins and then
disunity prevails. Being a cultural perfor-
mance group at the University, the Michigan
Bhangra Team has worked with other groups
as well, promoting themselves, their lesser-
known culture and other groups on campus.
"We've collaborated with various student
organizations ... such as some LGBT groups.
We are very active notonly in the Indian orga-
nization, but we have a very good relationship
with the Central Student Government."
We can see that there is an extensive
amount of diversity on our campus. From the
groups that perform on the Diag and at Hill
Auditorium, to the dozens of tables promoting
various cultural fundraising and appreciation
groups during Festifall. If we attempt to
homogenize the University, what will we have
to offer as students to the campus, and as
members of society to the world?
The experiences that we have while in the
confines of this University will dictate how
we understand or disparage others and their
culture, views and values. Our Michigan
Bhangra Team has become a strong cultural
force on campus, but is merely the tip of
the iceberg in terms of cultural groups that
promote and illustrate to the masses the
aspects of their cultures that are unique and
should be shared with the rest of us.

My fifth grade teacher used
to invite the girls to stay
in the classroom during
lunch and talk
about personal
experiences
and struggles
we've faced. Our
problems were
simpler back then,
but my classmates
and I still brought JENNY
up experiences of WANG
marginalization
on a fairly
consistent basis.
One person felt alienated from
Christian friends discussing the
Bible because she was a Muslim.
Another felt awkward because
she didn't speak English as well as
her friends did. Another felt alone
because the Black character in the
book she was reading didn't talk at
all like she and her family did. We
all sat there and listened carefully
(as well as fifth graders could).
There was no way we could have
experienced everybody's struggles
in the same way, but somehow, we
all understood each other. It was
this wonderful little setting where
we all saw each other's differences
and still treated each other with the
respect we deserved.
I'm not sure when the shift hap-
pened. Middle school? High school?
At some point, I seemed to have
bought into the idea that not seeing
our differences was some kind of
societal ideal. And that seeing differ-
ences - race specifically - somehow
made you racist.
A few weeks ago, I was walk-
ing with a friend, and we happened

to talk about race as a "social con-
struct" (that phrase likes to get
thrown into all sorts of contexts).
"Look," my friend said, "if the color
of your skin has nothing to do with
athletic ability or intelligence or
really anything that we value in our
society, then why do we still make
such a big deal out of it? We might as
well just stop 'seeing it' altogether."
Certainly, I think most of us
(should) agree that race has nothing
to do with our talents and potential.
All races are created equal. But a fact
that my friend ignored was that all
races are not socially created equal;
all races are not socially treated as
equal. We continue to marginalize
people of color, not just in the out-
side world but also here on campus
(think of the experiences brought
forth by #BBUM and the audacity of
the Hood Ratchet Thursday Party).
From micro-aggression to the sys-
tematic exclusion of minorities, race
continues to be salienttoday.
But on the flip side is our identity.
Even though outsiders continue to
call out and notice our race, many of
us still seem to embrace this racial
identity. Perhaps it's difficult to
understand why, given all the stigma
attached to one's race, we still strong-
ly embrace being called Black, Asian-
American, Latin@, etc.
Skin color is one of those things
that stays with me wherever I go.
Maybe I can hide my sexuality, my
class or even my gender, but race
is here to stay with me, whether I
want it to or not. It is permanently
attached to how others see me and
treat me. So like all groups that
have felt stigmatized, our options
are either to embrace ourselves or

hate ourselves. This may sound like
an extreme, but there are so many
cases of this: think nerds or gainers,
who've also faced stigma but now
have formed social communities to
reclaim their identity as something
positive and uplifting. Our desire to 4
rise up and give ourselves agency
amidst overwhelming feelings of
shame is a way to give meaning to
our lives.
OK. So yes. Racial groups continue
to face discrimination and stigma.
And racial groups, in response, work
to reclaim their identities. But that
doesn't change anything, right? A
colorblind society isstill an ideal, just
maybe not now?
Given how frustratingly persistent
stereotypes are, I don't see us
devaluing race anytime in the near
future. Nor do I see minoritiesletting
go of the culture they've created and
shaped. The counter-culture formed
by marginalized groups has deep
roots in our American identity and *
history; they are here to stay. And
that, I think, is not a bad thing at all.
Somehow we've been taught to
think that by seeing one's color,
we can't treat them with respect
and dignity. We've reduced Martin
Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream"
speech to a platitude that supposedly
calls for a colorblind society. But
I believe, in order to make real
progress, we need to rethink what
we consider ideal. We need to learn
not only to tolerate one's racial and
cultural differences, but also to
embrace this difference as a marker
of who we are as individuals.

We must be accountable for the facts with a
response that is timely and takes
responsibility for error. Without this we
break trust with our stakeholders."
- University President Mark Schlissel said during opening remarks
at yesterday's meeting of the University's Board of Regents.

Ivy League haircut

Mulaney' falters
despite great cast

20TH CENTURY FOX

Butt chin.

Polished comedian
doesn't bring
personality to sitcom
By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK
For The Daily
John Mulaney could very well
be the brightest comedian in
America right now - though the
man himself,
with his tidy
combed-back Mulaney
hair, tightly
buttoned FOX
shirt, rail- Sundays at
thin physique 9:30p.m.
and overall
dweebish
presence would probably
disagree. When Mulaney first
auditioned for "Saturday Night
Live" in 2008, his looks had
nothing new to offer among
the other gangly, white male
characters like Bill Hader and
Jason Sudeikis. What did catch
the eye of Seth Meyers, the
head writer at the time, was
Mulaney's extraordinary wit.
Meyers called him back after
the audition, not offering an
acting gig, but rather a writing
position on the show. When The
Chicago Tribune asked Meyers
about working with Mulaney,
he said, "I used to tell people
he brought me stuff on his first
day and, by the second, I was
bringing stuff to him, to make it
better."
So when Mulaney left the
sketch series to build his own
comedic empire in sitcom

television - following in
the footsteps of former staff,
members Amy Poehler ("Parks
and Recreation") and. Tina
Fey ("30 Rock") - with "SNL"
executive producer Lorne,
Michaels as well as a live studio
audience, many believed that
his show had the makings of a
"Seinfeld"-esque masterpiece.
Along with Mulaney, the cast
includes famous funny-people
Nasim Pedrad and Martin
Short, both previous "SNL" cast
members, as well as Sam Seaton,
a newcomer to the comedy
scene who's had success in the
TV series "Comedy Up Late."
The first episode follows
Mulaney, playing a more
amateur version of himself,
as he interviews to be a joke-
writer for fast-talking game
show host Lou Cannon (played
by Short). Meanwhile, his friend
and roommate Motif (Seaton),
also an aspiring comedian, is
trying to make his trademark
"Problem Bitch" joke go viral.
Motif's punchline: "if you don't
know a Problem Bitch, that's
'cause you are the Problem
Bitch!"
Mulaney's other friend Jane
(Pedrad) is recently single
and enjoys hacking into her
ex-boyfriend's e-mails to his
new girlfriend, which has
earned her the name "psycho
lady." As a personal trainer,
Jane is competitive and will
not give up her obsession with
getting closure from the failed
relationship. By the end of the
episode, she finally succeeds by
reading an argument via e-mail

between her ex and his new
girlfriend, in which he accuses
his the girl of being a "Problem
Bitch" and admits that while
Jane is crazy, "crazy calms
down but a Problem Bitch lasts
forever."
So everyone wins: Mulaney
gets his dream job, and after
some tug-of-war with Lou
Cannon, his jokes are finally
on-air, Jane gets her "closure"
because her ex-boyfriend
appreciates her madness and
Motif's "Problem Bitch" joke
catches on.
So what's the show's catch?
"Mulaney," with its brilliant
cast and belly-busting potential,
is just not that funny. But how
can this be? How can the genius
behind the flamboyant, bar-
hopping character of Stefon on
"SNL" not make people laugh?
It's not that John Mulaney
isn't funny. It's that he's a writer
and a stand-up comedian, not an
actor. The episode opens with
Mulaney in his natural habitat:
under a spotlight, mic in hand,
reeling off jokes to an audience.
In this setting, Mulaney's quick
wit and somewhat awkward,
flat speech is appropriate. When
he leaves the stage and enters
the sitcom set, however, things
get weird; Mulaney seems
excruciatingly self-aware,
addressing his friends and Lou
Cannon with a formality that's
clipped and uncomfortable.
While his sarcastic, flat
monotone works in his stand-up
acts, it gets old very fast in the
sitcom sphere - a place equal
parts comedy, and situation.

the boundaries between classic

rather than situational humor.
Cristela responds to every insult
she receives with a joke, then
proceeds to artificially laugh
at her own wit. Though it is
nice to see this human side of
the comedienne, it is difficult
to believe typical families have
dialogue this rehearsed. While
Cristela is naturally witty and
charming on screen, it seems
improbable that she alone can
uphold an entire show where
the material feels forced and the
jokes diluted.
As her sister complains,
"This isn't funny!" Cristela only
replies with, "It would be if you
just laughed!" Unfortunately,
from the basis of the premiere,
the show seems to mirror suit
- we often find it difficult to
laugh. Cristela has already
proven herself a talented writer
and comedienne, but now she
must translate her abilities to
the small screen.

Wolverines fall short against Penn State

Nittany Lions
goalkeeper stout
despite potent
Michigan offense
By MATHEW KIPNIS
Daily Sports Writer
Whenever Penn State
goalkeeper Britt Eckerstrom
made a save and held the ball
in her hands, the Michigan
women's soccer student section
began to chant the number of
seconds she kept the ball.
As the game went on the
student section continued to
count. And count. And count.
Eckerstrom held the ball a lot
Thursday night, because No. 24
Michigan couldn't find a way to
get one behind her as it fell to
the 11th-ranked Nittany Lions,
1-0.
The Wolverines (7-2-0 Big
Ten, 11-4-0 overall) maintained
control of the ball, pushing
into Penn State (8-1-0, 13-2-
0) territory for most of the
game, dominating shots, 18-8,
and corner kicks, 11-2. But
Eckerstrom was a brick wall in
goal, recording nine saves.
"We knew she is a good
goalkeeper," said Michigan
coach Greg Ryan. "I thought she
was good in every phase of the
game tonight. She made some
big saves especially with the
shot she tipped over the bar in
the first half."
Eckerstrom has given up just

t was the frst gme i .'

Sept. 21 that Michigan was held
without a goal and just the third
time all season.
This game was a much
different shutout than the
games earlier in the season,
though. In those three games
the Wolverines were outscored
9-0 and totaled just 19 shots.
On Thursday night, Michigan
tallied 18 shots and only
conceded a single goal, showing
progress from the beginning of
the season.
"Since San Diego, when
we gave up eight goals and
scored nothing, they have just
progressed so far," Ryan said.
"Those shutouts were ugly.
When you dominate a game to
that extent and get that number
of chances and are constantly

you are unfortunate if you don't

"We have never dominated
Penn State, not in seven years.
They have a lot to be proud of."
Although the Wolverines
got more shots off than they
had in previous shutouts and
dominated the possession, they
couldn't get the type of quality
shots they were looking for.
In the second half, the
Wolverines made an adjustment
to try and find higher quality
looksby pushing the ball further
into the box and not settling
for shots outside the box. The
quality of shots looked much
better for Michigan, but Penn
State made an adjustment to
switch from a 3-5-2 to a 4-5-1 as
well as dropping more players

in the second half, but Waldeck
again looked the most likely to
score. On multiple occasions,
she was able to cut in on her
left foot and beat Nittany Lion
defenders, but was unable to
beat the keeper.
Michigan's flair for the
dramatic, which it has shown
on multiple occasions in its
2014 campaign, was lacking
on Thursday night. A late
equalizer seemed to be coming,
but time and- time again, the
ball skipped off the wet surface
away from the Wolverine
attackers.
Despite the disappointing
defeat, Michigan remained
confident that a Big Ten regular
season title was still in reach.
"It's a tough loss and a big
game," Waldeck said. "But
I don't think it'll determine
anything for the end of the
season."

'M' to face fastest competition in Wisconsin

By DAVID FARNUM
For the Daily
The No. 11 Michigan men's
cross country team has faced
tough competition before, but it
hasn't seen a field quite like this.
Featuring 15 of the top 25
teams inthe country,highlighted
by No. 3 Northern Arizona, the
Wisconsin Adidas Invitational
in Madison on Friday could
be its biggest indicator of how
well they stack up against
competition.
After two first-place finishes
earlier in the season, the event
will mark the team's first
competition since two weeks
ago when it won the Blue and
Gold Invitational in South Bend.
That was the first true test for
Michigan on the year, as it faced
a few top-ranked opponents,
including then-No. 10 BYU and
No. 15 New Mexico.
Michigan coach Kevin
Sullivan looks to use the
experience gained at Notre

"We want to keep doing what

The Michigan Daily - michigandailycom

The starter you don't notice on Saturday

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports ditor
The specialists are the first
players out on the field prior to
Michigan football gmes, about
an hour before the team runs
out and touches the banner.
If you arrive early, you watch
kicker Matt Wile and punter Will
Hagerup intently, to see if they
look ready to make the plays that
could determine the game.
But there's another specialist
on the field, one you don'tee.
He's just as responsible for the
success of the Wolverines' special
teams, but he might as well be
invisible He stands 14 y rds in
front of Hagerup, legs spread
apart andthe football in between,
laces up. He hunches over and
throttles the ball through his
legs, a tight spiral directli into
Hagerup's right hip.
He plays the most specialized
position in football, the one were
success is expected so often hat
it goes unrecognized, but the
slightest mistake - even if it'sjust
a couple of inches - can draw the
scrutiny of an entire fan base.5
He's touched the ball on 42 6f
Michigan's 152 points this season,
but he couldn't be happier that
you don't notice him.
He's Scott Sypniewski,
Michigan's redshirt freshman
long snapper, and he hopes you
never say his name during games.
"If I could run onto the field
and run off and no one know I
was even there, that's a job well
done for me," Sypniewski said.
Itwouldtake onlyone snap over
Hagerup's head for Sypniewski's
anonymity to disappear.
That's why Sypniewski treats
every snap the same, whether
it's a game-winning field goal
attempt at Rutgers or a second-
quarter punt against Appalachian
State when the Wolverines
already have a sizeable lead.
He has one goal on every
play: a perfect snap. On punts,

Sypniewski's subtle inaccuracies
when other coaches might not.
"He notices when I screw up
because he also knows what it
is to: screw up, too," Sypniewski
said.
But Hoke also notices when
Sypniewski is doing well. After
Michigan's win over Penn State
in which Wile made three field
goals, Hoke noted Sypniewski
and the rest of the unit when
asked about his kicker's success.
"So we're really, really, really
excited, and you forget" about
Scott Sypniewski, the snapper,"
Hoke said. "You -forget about
Kenny Allen, who holds, and
how much they work together
every day and how successful he
was and a lot of it starts there,
too."
No matter how well
Sypniewski. does, the attention
will always go to the person he's
snappingto. Wile earned Big Ten
Co-Special Teams Player of the
Week, but even he acknowledged
that his kicking is the final
product of the work of the unit.
Sypniewski is satisfied to labor
in the realm of the unknown, he's
too focused on the task at hand.
He doesn't partake in elaborate
celebrations after touchdowns
because he doesn't want to be too
excited and make a mistake on
the snap.
He spends the majority of his
time on the sidelines preparing
for the next time he needs to go
out -onto the field. He snaps to
Allen, Hagerup or the portable
net adjacent to Michigan's bench.
When the likelihood of a kick
increases, Sypniewski advances
toward the field.
When it's time for the kick,
he runs onto the field, makes the
snap and runs off.
Hopefully you don't notice.

Redshirt freshman long snapper Scott Sypniewski isn't often recognized for his crucial role on special teams, which is jsot the way he prefers to go about it:

When he reached his junior

saw the toll
that battling
in the trenches
took on his father's body. Playing
long snapper would incur less
damage.

Because of his father's
knowledge of snapping the
football, Sypniewski worked with
him at a turf facility each day
during his junior and senior years
of high school, taking between
20 to 5t snaps. The monotony of
the job might bore other players,
but Sypniewski focused on taking
perfect snaps, not just snapping
the ball for the sake of doing it.
The recruiting process for long
snappers is the same as it is for
every other position. Sypniewski
attended - numerous camps to
get his name out there. His high
school in Illinois was small and
few college coaches attended
games. But the offer Sypniewski
wanted came from the people
who already knew his name:
the trio who coached his father
in college that now coached at

Michigan.

Long snappers operate. in the.
shadows on many teams, away
from the watchful eye of coaches
who either lack the knowledge to
coach the position or are too busy
with other responsibilities.
The opposite is the case at
Michigan. In addition to playing
linebacker during his playing
career at Ball State, Hoke was
a long snapper. He places a
premium on the position, the
reason he chooses to assign
scholarships to longsnappers.
Hoke pays close attention
to Sypniewski during practice,
and games, helping him along
throughout his first year as
a starter. Hoke recognizes

ROSEMONT, Ill. - A beefed-
up Caris LeVert arrived at Thurs-
day's Big Teri Basketball Media
Day without
braces, and. he NOTEBOOK
got to show off
his smile after being named to
the Preseason All-Big Ten team
by the media.
Thejunior guard is joined on
the team by Indiana guard Yogi
Ferrell, Wisconsin forward Sam
Dekker, Nebraska forward Ter-
ran Petteway and Wisconsin
forward Frank Kaminsky, who
was voted the Big Ten Preseason
Player of the Year.
During a breakout campaign
in 2013-14, LeVert averaged 12.9
points and 4.3 rebounds while
emerging as a secondary scor-
ing threat behind Nik Stauskas.
LeVert shot43.9 percentfromthe
field and will see more attention
this season as he tries to keep
Michigan's young team steady in
a deep Big Ten.
"He was in (the spotlight) a bit
last year," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "There were sev-
eral games where we just went to
him because people were doing
things with Nik or Glenn (Rob-
inson III).
"I love his personality because
he doesn't let things bother him
very much, so I don't think he
gets too excited or gets too wor-
ried about either situation."
The Wolverines didn't make
the media's preseason top three,
which. included unanimous
favorite Wisconsin, followed by
Ohio State and Michigan State.
ROLLING OUT THE WEL-
COME WAGON: Thursday
marked the first Big Ten Media
Day for Rutgers and Maryland,
and the new league members
both expressed their excitement
to get started.
"I've followed a lot of these
coaches for a long time, fol-
lowed the programs, so I know
they're all excellent coaches,"
said Maryland coach Mark Tur-
geon. "Arguably, it'sbeenthebest
league in the country the last
four or five years. So, with that

said, there's a lot of anticipation
going into it, and we're looking
forward to it."
The Terrapins join the Big Ten
from the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence, another basketball pow-
erhouse, and project to be the.
better of the two new members.
Maryland finished 17-15 last sea-
son and features former Wolver-
ine forward Evan Smotrycz as a
key contributor.
As they proved with an upset
win over then-No. 5 Virginia in
2014, the Terrapins are a talented
group. They return 10 members
of last year's team, and while
they could have a tough time
consistently competing with the
conference's elite, they're capa-
ble of turningheads.
Rutgers, on the other hand,
could face a much steeper battle
in its Big Ten debut.
The Scarlet Knights went
12-21 last year in coach Eddie
Jordan's first season at the helm
and are expected to finish near
the bottom of the conference.
Jordan, though, says it's all part
of a greater development process.

"We know where we're com-
ing from," he said. "Even last
year, we thought the process was
successful - the first stage of it.
We were picked last.in our con-
ference. We were seventh. People
thought we would win eight or
nine games. We won 12. So we
feel our kids competed with
(class), and that was the first part
of the process.
"We understand we're going
to a tougher league, and the sec-
ond part of the process is to get
better players, which we think .
we did, to be competitive and to
meet the opponent eye to eye and
play with harmony and effort.
That's the second part of the pro-
cess, and we think we're doing ok
with that."
FORWARD THINKING:
Beilein hinted Thursday at what
many have expected for his
front-court plans. While he has
yet to give any indication as to
who will start at center, he gave
some insight on what to look for
from freshman forward Kam-
eron Chatman.
"He's got a great chance to

start at one of our forward posi-
tions," Beilein said. "He's a very
natural ball handler and really
proven to be a very good shooter
thus far. I'm very optimistic he
can give us quality minutes from
day to day."
One thing Chatman could do
for the Wolverines is provide
much-needed rebounding help.
LeVert led the team in defensive
rebounds last season, pulling
in 141 boards from the guard
position.
And while Chatmanis still fill-
ing out his frame, Beilein thinks
he will be a useful contributor.
"His body is changing daily,"
Beilein said. "I don't think you'll
see his true body until the next
couple years. He's not afraid to
go in (for a rebound) and he's got
great hands and instincts for the
ball."
Beilein has not decided in
which position - the '3' or the '4'
- he will play Chatman, but said
he will decide based on a variety
of factors, including defensive
ability and how he runs the ball
screen.

COURTESY OFTHE COMPHER FAMILY
JT Compher, second to right, is pictured here with teammates from his youth hockey days. Compher progressed thorugh hockey faster than most kids his age before he arrived at Michigan.

COMPHER
From Page 5B
he would stay home. He
couldn't leave his family.
But Valerie held firm. "We
would've never let him stay
home and pass on this oppor-
tunity," she said.
So Compher went to Ann
Arbor and, looking back, he
thinks going to Ann Arbor
was the best his parents
could have made him do
given the circumstance.
The first week of U.S.
NDPT camp is widely
known as the toughest week.
Compher said they put him
through "the ringer." The
players skate twice a day,
condition twice a day and try
to adjust to their new home
in Ann Arbor. Still, despite
the business and distrac-
tions, his father's cancer
still remained forefront in
his head. It stayed that way
throughout the week.
Days were long, Com-
pher admitted. But he never
thought his Dad would lose
his battle. Why? Because
Compher said his competi-
tive nature stems from his
father and the constant sup-
0 port from his billet family,
the Karibians. Bob agreed.

"You want to show your
family you're going to do
what you got to do to get it
done," he said.
And Bob did just that.
Soon after, doctor's success-
fully removed Bob's cancer
and the first person on the
phone with Bob was JT.
After the call, Compher
said he "took a deep breath"
and could focus on what he
originally planned to do it
Ann Arbor: grow as a hock-
ey player. He could go back
normal - competing harder
than anyone else because
if he doesn't, he feels out of
place and he has no room for
regrets.
Not only did Compher
excel in the first year the
NTDP program - notching
50 points in 49 games - but
his mastery earned him a
spot on the U-18 team for
IIHF Ice Hockey U18 World
Championship.
Despite being one of the
youngest players in the tour-
nament, the challenge was
never too great. Compher
tallied four goals in nine
games and scored a goal
in the Gold-Medal game
against Sweden, a game the
U.S. won.
In his second year, Com-

pher registered 57 points in
59 games, garnering serious
interest from NHL teams.
So on Compher went to
New York City, home of the
2013 NHL draft. It was given
he'd be drafted so his nerves
should've been tamer. But
when the Buffalo Sabres
drafted Compher with the
35th pick, shock ran through
his body.
"When you hear your
name called, you're like 'oh
shit, this happened,' " Com-
pher recalled. "You give your
mom a hug, dad a hug, then
you're gone for an hour."
Compher finally felt vali-
dated for his endless hours
of practice, travel to far away
rinks and all the off-the-ice
conditioning. And to Com-
pher, there was no better
way to spend the draft than
with Bob and his entire fam-
ily.
But Compher knew he
couldn't get complacent. He
knew he had bigger goals
in mind, namely a NCAA
Championship. He knew the
grind was only going to get
tougher.
JT Compher is a pest on
the ice. He knows it. Every
teammate he's had knows
it. But they don't complain;

they understand his motive.
"I'm one of the more
annoying guys to play
against in practice; I hear
it everyday," Compher
said. "I do like to try to get
under guys' skins because
some guys need a little bit
of fire to get their practice
going. If they're mad at me
and it helps them to work
harder, it's good for me, it's
good for them, good for the
team."
Jack Eichel, a teammate
of Compher's on the NTDP
team in 2012-13 and cur-
rent Boston University
forward, certainly noticed.
Eichel's projected to be a
top-five pick in the 2015
NHL draft.
"He is just so good wher-
ever he is," Eichel told NHL.
com. "He's a role model to
me and I really look up to
him. He's a great kid and a
great leader. Everyone else
tries to match him. A guy
like that on your team, it's
really good.
"Everyone tries to work
as hard as him, and if every-
one works as hard as JT, you
know you have a good team."
Junior forward Andrew
Copp echoed Eichel's senti-
ment. And Copp knows JT's
intensity as well as anyone

after he played victim to
Compher's antics last season.
"He'll hack you, slash you,
hit you late," Copp recalled.
"He'll do anything it takes to
get under your skin.
"I hate going against him
in practice, but I'd rather
have him on my team than
anyone else's team."
Copp said it best. No mat-
ter how annoying Compher
is to play against, players
wish they could channel the
same work level as him.
Now on the same line as
Compher, Copp no longer
has to deal with the slashes
or late hits, but he knows just
because Compher's lost one
of his targets, his grittiness
won't stop.
Copp said Compher has
"crossed the line" several
times - something Copp
said he never did while a
freshman - and that the
current freshman are well
aware of Compher's practice
intensity. And that doesn't
bother Berenson.
"That's his DNA: If there's
a loose puck, he's going to
win the battle for it," Beren-
son said. "No matter how
hard you try, he's going to
try and try harder. He's got
a compete level that doesn't
stop.

"And you know, JT has
been exceptional player
ever since he was young, but
he doesn't act that way. He
doesn't wear that mantle."
What shows is his disgust
with losing and it's no secret
that Michigan's last two
seasons have ended early
in disappointment. Michi-
gan hockey is a program
that qualifies to the NCAA
Tournament every year. It's
a team that opposing schools
circle in red prior to the sea-
son. Michigan hockey is not
last year's team - a team
that Compher played for. He
knows that, and he uses his
grittiness in practice to show
others what it means to wear
the block 'M'.
Compher has every inten-
tion ofchangingthe program
around. He knows he will do
everything in his power to
reverse the trend even if he
makes his teammates feel
uncomfortable - he doesn't
care. He only cares about
raising another banner in
Yost Ice Arena.
And for the rest, it's
reassuring knowing they
have a hockey player in
Compher, who will fight his
best friends over a game of
PlayStation, to help turn the
program around.

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
Most of its early stats are
unofficial, but two exhibition
contests and a single regular
season game have shown the No.
10 Michigan hockey team to be
deep on both sides of the puck.
In front of two start-worthy
goaltenders, the Wolverines have
the potential to have a breakout
offensive season, if they can stay
healthy.
Forwards: After only one
non-conference game and two
exhibitions, the Michigan hockey
team's forward lines are clicking,
already.
The offense has scored 16 goals
in three contests, an average of
more than five goals per game.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
has pointed to the second line, one
featuring freshman center Dylan
Larkin, sophomore forward Alex
Kile and senior Zach Hyman, as
one he expects to stick together
when the Wolverines enter the
thick of their nonconference
schedule.
Unofficially, Larkin is leading
the Wolverines in scoring. The
Detroit Red Wings prospect has
already shown flashes of the
speed that made him a first-round
draft pick, following up a two-
goal performance against the U.S.
Under-18 National Development
Program with three assists and a
goal against Wilfrid Laurier.
Larkin's presence at center
may be the reason Kile has
emerged as an offensive threat
early on. In two games on the
line, Kile has tallied a goal and
three assists, matching Hyman's
four points over that period. All
told, the trio combined for 15
points in exhibition play, making
it Michigan's most productive
line.
This offense has also matured.
JT Compher, the reigning
Michigan and Big Ten Freshman
of the Year, is now a sophomore,
and an alternate captain at that.
Before the season, the forward
made the switch to wing, flanking
junior center Andrew Copp.
Though the duo sat out against
Wilfrid Laurier last week,
last season's top-two scorers
are expected to be lethal on
Michigan's top line.
Production from the fourth

line, too, proves the offense
is Michigan's deepest unit.
Senior Travis Lynch may be
the Wolverines most improved
player, tallying two key third-
period goals (one official) after
scoring just twice in 29 games
last year. Lynch has been praised
for late-game face-off victories.
Junior forward Justin Selman
also added a goal and an assist in
three contests.
Selman is out indefinitely,
though, after fracturing his wrist
during the second period last
Thursday. It is unclear who will
take his place. The Wolverines
have options, though, especially
once players like freshman
forward Tony Calderone recover
from preseason injuries, which is
expected to be soon.
Michigan's early offensive
success is a product of a strong
presence in front of goal,
somethingtheunitstruggledwith
last season. Combine that with a
set of defensemen with the talent
to shoot from the blue line on the
power play, and the Wolverines
should be able to capitalize when
goals are at a premium.
Defensemen: The late
addition of freshman Zach

Werenski has changed this unit
from Michigan's biggest question
mark to one of its strengths.
In last Thursday's exhibition,
Werenski - a 17-year-old who
completed his high school degree
over the summer - tallied two
goals in four minutes. And he
made it look easy. He might not
be the next Jacob Trouba, but for
a team that lacked a legitimate
scoring threat on defense last
season, Werenski's presence on
the power play will be key.
The Wolverines are also aided
by the full return of sophomore
Kevin Lohan, who missed the
majority of last season due to a
torn anterior circulate ligament. A
6-foot-5, 220-pound defenseman,
Lohan brings both, physical
presence and offensive potential.
On a line with Werenski, Lohan
added a goal and an assist in two
exhibition games.
Should he remain healthy,
Lohan - who did not play the
third period against Wilfrid
Laurier due to a "tweaked" knee,
according to Berenson - will be
an impact player for Michigan on
defense.
Like the offense, this unit has
had a year to mature.
Though the defense is without

former starters Mac, Bennett
and Kevin Clare, players like
sophomores Michael Iowning
and Nolan De Jong are a year
wiser on the blue line. Meanwhile,
senior Andrew Sinelli enters as
a defenseman by trade after a
junior season in which he split
time between units.
Goaltending: Though
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort's
freshman campaign was
impressive enough to earn him
a fourth-round selection to the
Edmonton Oilers in the 2014
NHL Draft, it did not secure
him a starting job as Michigan's
goaltender.
That's because junior Steve
Racine hasn't regressed, despite
his time on the bench last season.
Berenson has said he's not
going to name a starter in the
near future, and that having
two goalies he's comfortable
playing is a good problem.
That's a compliment, given that
Nagelvoort set a program record
for saves in a single game.
In the first three contests, both
netminders have shown signs
of early-season jitters. Against
Ferris State, Nagelvoort allowed
two goals in the opening minutes

of play and four goals total. He
was beaten early again against
the U.S. NTDP, while Racine
allowed a goal just seconds into
his third-period appearance.
Still, Nagelvoort has gotten
the nod in all three contests so
far, and is expected to be in net
Friday, when the Wolverines take
on New Hampshire at Yost Ice
Arena.

fnot on the iceafternearlyevery
elementary school day, JT Com-
pher found himself in one of his
three best friend's basements.
The four friends all lived in the
same neighborhood - a convenient
five-minute walk from the junior
high school - so playing pick up
sports was never a problem. If the
weather didn't hold up, they con-
gregated in front of the television
and played PlayStation 2 for endless
amounts of time.
That is, until, Compher lost a
game.
"Sounds familiar," Compher said
with a smirk. "I guess I broke a few
controllersback in the day."
Those, though, were the mild
outbursts: If it were a had loss, he'd
proceed to fight whoever he played
- punches, tackling and all
"As a mom, you're thinking 'oh
my god, it's just a game, it's just a
game,' said Valerie Compher, JT's
mom. "But to them, nothing was just
a game. EspeciallyJT."
But this isn't out of the ordinary
for people who know Compher. They
understand he's a competitive per-
fectionist who, above all else, hates
losing.
From the outside looking in, peo-
ple who don't know Compher may
think his competitiveness is insane.
But for the Michigan hockey team
that has failed to make the NCAA
tournament two consecutive years,
Compher's compete level is wel-
comed. It's his type of attitude that
Michigan coach Red Berenson pines
for. It's his compete level that will
lead a resurgence effort to make the
Wolverines relevant again.
Bob Compher, JT's father,
coached all of his son's Little League
baseball teams - house league and
travel.
JT, one of the best players,
reached base more time than not.
He'd usually steal second and then
third, but thatdidn'tsatisfy the now-
Michigan hockey standout's inner
competitiveness. So Bob developed
a play unique to his son, one that
would satisfy his son's adrenaline.
On third base, Compher would
look over to his Dad as soon as he
touched the bag. Then, Bob would
perfectly time the catcher throw-
ing the ball back to the pitcher, and
in that short-time span, would nod
his head toward Compher, signaling
him to run. Nearly every time, Com-
pher safely stole home and scored on
a play that only he could do.
Despite the base running hero-
ics, though, both Bob and Compher
knew his talents were better suited
off the diamond.

Compher, an A-team travel base-
ball player, found more success play-
ing for the Northbrook Bluehawks, a
house league hockey team that was
no cut. Compher scored at will and
his team never had issues winning
titles, including the Northern Illi-
nois Hockey League Pee Wee cham-
pionship.
But that was the biggest problem;
hockey was becoming too easy -
playing in house league hockey was
stunting his hockey growth.
"People kept coming to us and
telling us, 'He needs to leave,' " Val-
erie said. "It wasn't until Mark Brun-
ner, Director of Northbrook Hockey,
and his coach Evan Poulakidas came
to us and told us he needs to go that
it hit us."
So on he went to a higher level of
hockey, leaving no time for baseball
and that was bittersweet. Compher,
a family-oriented man, could no
longer spend countless afternoons
on the diamond with his dad. While
this could've been disappointing for
Bob, as well, he always knew this
possibility existed.
Bob, admittedly, didn't closely fol-
low hockey so, in a sense, he learned
the sport with his son and JT loved
that.
"I didn't have a dad telling me
what to do on the ice," Compher
said. "I never had to score five goals
to satisfy him or do certain things. It
was 'if you were working hard, good
job.'"
Soon after Compher's jump
to Triple-A Team Illinois that it,
too, became simple. The forward
notched 39 points in 34 games - at
just 15-years old.
Compher quickly became a hot
commodity amongst the Major-
Junior hockey world despite his age.
The Waterloo Blackhawks, a United
States Hockey League team, noticed
Compher first and offered him a spot
on their team.
The decision seemed obvious for
Compher. Competing with kids six
years older seemed appealing con-
sidering his inherent need of a chal-
lenge. That is until Bob and Valerie
interjected.
"It was gut wrenching when he
walked out of the locker room after
making the Waterloo Blackhawks
literally two months after he turned
15." Valerie said. "Especially him
saying 'I want to play here' and him
not thinking about the fact that at
the time it was because he was so
competitive and he would've been
the youngest one playing in the
league.
"It didn't really click with him
that he'd be moving away. It wasn't

until I said something in the car,
'You know you'd be moving away?'
that he realized. And then I burst
into tears."
That wouldn't be the last time
Compher, and his family, would
have to make a career-changing
decision.
In 2011, Bob, Valerie and JT were
on their way to Ann Arbor to visit
the United States Hockey's Nation-
al Team Development Program, a
highly competitive two-year pro-
gram that boasts the country's best
17- and-18-year old' hockey play-
ers. Players go through a rigourous
selection process and those selected
are required to move to Ann Arbor.
Compher met with program offi-
cials and it became clear a future
offer to join the U.S. NTDP loomed.
While in Ann Arbor, the Comphers'
figured they'd kill two birds with
one stone by also making a stop at
the University of Michigan for an
unofficial visit and chance for Com-
pher to introduce himself to the
coaches.
Already beaming with excite-
ment from a positive meeting with
Team USA coaches and officials, the
Comphers were in for another unex-
pected surprise. In that first meet-
ing with Red Berenson, Michigan's
veteran coach, Berenson offered
Compher a full-ride scholarship - a
thought that never crosses the Com-
phers' minds prior to the trip.
"We were kind of shocked; we

thought it was an unofficial thing,"
Compher said. "It kind of took us
aback. We weren't expecting it and
that's when I thought I could move
on in the sport and someday make a
living out of it."
Added Valerie: "We were com-
pletely blindsided. We didn't know
it was coming at all. We just went to
visit while we were visiting the US
team. We all looked at each other
like we got hit with a hockey puck
in the head because we really didn't
comprehend it."
Bob recalled jokingly asking
Berenson how he knew his son
would be a solid hockey player three
years down the road. But of course,
the offer stood. Better yet, soon
after their arrival back to North-
brook, Compher was offered a spot
to join the NTDP.
This time, though, Compher was
ready to leave home. He was men-
tally and physically prepared to take
on USA hockey.
Compher could've felt invincible.
He'd received a NTDP offer and
a Michigan scholarship in a short
period of time. In other words, he
had been accepted to college before
most kids his age even take the ACT.
Behind the scenes, though, Val-
erie and Bob had more news, but
not the kind they knew how to tell
their son. Bob had been diagnosed
with prostate cancer in May - three
months before Compher was sched-
uled to leave for Ann Arbor - but

they knew they couldn't tell JT,
knowing full well that he'd dwell in
the idea of staying home, ditching
the U.S. program.
"We didn't tell the kids until we
had a good game plan which was
August," Valerie said. "We really
waited until right before he left
because we didn't want him to reso-
nate in the fact that he was going to
think he was going to stay home."
So a week before Compher left,
Bob and Valerie sat him and his two
sisters, Morgan, 18, and Jesse, 14, at
kitchen table to break the news.
"My parents sat us down and my
Dad said, 'In a couple weeks, I'm
going into surgery, I've been diag-
nosed with cancer. Luckily they've
caught it early,'" Compher recalled
solemnly. "But once you hear "can-
cer," it's cancer."
Not only did this news linger in
the back of mind, but Bob's ensuing
surgery in two weeks meant Com-
pher would be away in Ann Arbor
for his first week with the national
program. The question wouldn't
leave his mind: should I stay or
should I go?
Bob and Valerie helped make
the decision easier, telling Com-
pher only one option existed: You're
goingto Ann Arbor. Still, Compher's
kept telling himself he needed to
help his dad: He needed to inject
his competitiveness into his dad.
So the first words out of his mouth
after Bob broke the news were that
