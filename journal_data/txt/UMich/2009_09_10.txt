University officials
don't know how
many doses will be
available or needed
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
As the threat of a swine flu
pandemic looms, a major ques-
tion remains for University of-
ficials preparing for its arrival:
how many students will want to
be vaccinated?
Although the H1N1 vaccine is
not available yet, University and
public health officials estimate it
will be distributed to the public in
late October or early November.
Dr. Robert Winfield, the Uni-
versity's chief medical officer,
said the University ordered ap-
proximately 25,000 doses of the
H1N1 vaccine. While more than
40,000 students attend the Uni-
versity, Winfield said he doesn't
expect more than half of the stu-
dents will want to be vaccinated.
"We don't anticipate every-
body will want to get the vaccine,"
he said, adding that only about 10
percentof University students get
vaccinated for the seasonal flu.
The regular, seasonal influenza
vaccine - which doesn't prevent

people from contracting H1N1
- will be available to students in
late September
Winfield said the University
will practice a mass vaccination
with the seasonal flu shot as a way
to prepare for the HtNl vaccine.
Students and faculty from the
Schools of Public Health, Nurs-
ing and Dentistry and College of
Pharmacy will help with vacci-
nations in the University Health
Service's Allergy, Immunization
and Travel Health Clinic for $42.
The Dean of Students Office will
also offer seasonal flu vaccina-
tions for a discounted price of $15
at Palmer Commons on Sept. 30.
Because University students
were labeled as one of five prior-
ity groups for the H1N1 vaccine
in late July, officials at colleges
around the country are scram-
bling to make last-minute prepa-
rations.
When all people younger than
age 24 became a priority group for
the vaccine, Dr. Robert Ernst, the
medical director of UHS, said the
decision considerably changed

Combination of
academic prestige,
football brings John
Roberts to campus
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
What does it take to get a visit
from the chief justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court? University offi-
cials went with football tickets to
the Notre Dame game. It worked.
This weekend the University of

Michigan's Law School will cel-
ebrate its 150th anniversary with a
full schedule of events, including a
live feed of the Notre Dame football
game in the Law Quad, a panel dis-
cussion of the Law School's contri-
butions to the legal field - in which
all living deans of the Law School
will participate - and a question-
and-answer session with Supreme
Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
In a letter obtained by The Mich-
igan Daily, Law School Dean Evan
Caminker invited Roberts in 2007
to attend the celebrations, offering
him a plethora of amenities includ-
ing seats at midfield to the Notre

Dame game at the Big House.
"I recognize that you receive
many more invitations to visit law
schools than you can possibly ac-
cept," Carminker wrote in the let-
ter, "but I daresay that Michigan
Law can offer something no other
law school can: a seat at midfield in
the Big House!"
"Only at this great law school,"
the letter continued, "can you take a
Saturday afternoon off, walk down
the street, and sing Hail to the Vic-
tors with 110,000 of your new best
friends as you (I hope?) cheer on
one of the best college football
teams in the nation."

Carminker's pitch culminated
with an appeal to the variety of ac-
tivities Roberts could take part in
on campus.
"Given this hat trick of opportu-
nities, I would like to invite you to
come visit the University of Michi-
gan Law School, spend some infor-

THE TEXTBOOK INDUSTRY
A shuttered shop
and changing scene

Stockwell: Men, freshmen out

Other bookstores
try to fill void left by
Shaman Drum
By LINDSAY KRAMER
DailyStaffReporter
As Welcome Week's festivities
come to a close this week, stu-
dents around the country of ev-
ery academic stripe are facing the
same sobering experience: buying
textbooks.
This year, in Ann Arbor, one
campus landmark is nothing but an
empty storefront.
For 29 years, Shaman Drum Book-
shop, known for its selection of spe-
cialty English and history texts, had
beenastaplefor students purchasing
books for class and for leisure.
On June 30, Shaman Drum fell
victim to a changing sales envi-
roment in the textbook industry,
brought on primarily by the In-
ternet, that has hurt independent
bookstores across the country.
With Shaman Drum leaving the
campus textbook market, other
bookstores have been left to pick
up the slack.
Michigan Book and Supply add-
ed an entire wall of English books
that had not been sold there in pre-
vious years. Evan Lee, an employee,
said Shaman Drum's closing was
the reason behind the addition of

new inventory.
Many of the books Shaman
Drum typically carried were for
obscure and advanced courses. Of-
ten, professors for these courses
would only give their book lists to
Shaman Drum. As a result of the
surge in orders of these types of
books from professors, Michigan
Book and Supply ran out of plastic
sleeves used to hold the cards that
identify books for specific courses.
However, not all professors
chose to continue ordering books
through local stores.
"Quite a few more students have
come in asking for books that were
not ordered," Lee said. The students
"were told (by their professors)
they could be ordered online."
This trend has become more
common in recent years, with the
increasing tendency of professors
to post textbook requirements early
on CTools, Wolverine Access and
the UBook program offered bythe
University.
Additionally, students often look
online or to their peers for lower
prices even before they return to
Ann Arbor in the fall.
Shaman Drum owner Karl Pohrt
contends that these developments
contributed to his store's downfall.
"My sense was it was decided
to put everything online to make it
easier for students," Pohrt said. He
also said he understood "the idea

After renovations,
former all-female
res. hall welcomes
new residents
By JILLIAN BERMAN
DailyNewsEditor
The brand new Stockwell Resi-
dence Hall boasts amenities one
would be hard-pressed to find in
other residence halls.
The computer lab's giant moni-
tor and Web cam and the atrium's
natural light enable Stockwell to
offer a different type of on-campus
living experience.
But for LSA sophomore Seena

live in the formerly all-female
residence hall, there's only one
change that really matters.

"We're celebrating the past and
the future today' Coleman said at
the ceremony.
Stockwell's renovation was
part of Coleman's Residential Life
Initiative, a program that has in-
eluded the construction of the
one-year-old Hill Dining Center
and North Quad Residence Hall,
which will open next fall.
In addition to the physical
changes to the building, the resi-
dence hall boasts two other major,
new features. The residence hall,
which has been all female since
it was completed in 1940, will be
coeducational for the first time.
It will also house a new living-
learning community focused on
sophomores.

center assistant who lives in Stock-

The Michigan chapter of the

dents attacked a 16-year-old girl of
Iraqi heritage on a school bus in
Ann Arbor Tuesday.
The family of the girl told CAIR

According to the press release,

"Because of the slurs reportedly

The girl required six stitches

Budget scramble
intensifies as
deadline nears
House Speaker Andy Dillon said
yesterday that Democrats who
control the Michigan House could
start passing revised budget bills
next week for the fiscal year that
starts Oct. 1.
His comments came after
Republican lawmakers and Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm said
they're anxious for House Demo-
crats to pass their version of leg-
islation addressing a $2.7 billion
budget shortfall so final budget
negotiations can take place. Law-
makers say they are trying to avoid
a repeat of 2007, when Michigan
was four hours into a partial gov-
ernment shutdown before the Leg-
islature signed off on a temporary
budget deal.
Speaking yesterday evening on
WJR-AM's "Ask the Governor"
program, Granholm said Michi-
gan would not go through another
shutdown like the one in 2007,
"when we had no budget and no
money. Now we have cash from
(the federal Recovery Act) but
we only have it for two years. We
won't have a cash flow problem but
we still have to get budget under
control."

Colombian police
seize millions in
cash from port
Colombian customs agents say
they seized $11.3 million in cash
from a shipping container in the
nation's largest cargo port.
National customs director
Nestor Diaz says it is the most cash
ever seized by police at a port in
Colombia, which is a major source
of cocaine trafficking. No arrests
were reported.
Diaz said yesterday the cash was
hidden in a shipment of ammo-
nium sulfate that arrived in the
Pacific coast port of Buenaventura
from Mexico. He didn't identify
the company that shipped the con-
tainer.
NEWTON, Massachusetts
Former Bush chief
of staff considers
Senate run
Former Bush White House Chief
of Staff Andrew Card said yester-
day he is "thinking very seriously"
about launching a campaign for the
Senate seat left vacant by the death
of Sen. Edward Kennedy.
"I would like very much to run for
the U.S. Senate," said the longtime
Republican stalwart, who said he
won't make a final decision until he
can discuss it further with his wife.
Card said he will announce his
final decision in the next three to
four days.
State Sen. Scott Brown, who has
been mulling a run for the Senate

seat, said yesterday that he would
urge Republicans to close ranks
behind Card. He said he would
drop his own bid if Card opts in.
"I amgoingto encourage all of you
to support Andy and to encourage
him to run," Brown told a meeting of
state Republicans in Newton, Mass.
Card's years serving in the White
House under former President
George W. Bush could prove to be
a dicey political hurdle in heavily
Democratic Massachusetts.
LOS ANGELES
Mother charged
with two counts of
murder
A mother accused of fatally slash-
ing her two daughters' throats inside
their Los Angeles home has been
charged with two counts of murder.
Antonia Gomez was also charged
yesterday with the special circum-
stance of multiple murders, making
her eligible for the death penalty if
convicted.
Prosecutors alleged Gomez
stabbed her 11-year-old daughter
Edith Moreno and her 17-year-old
sister Diana Moreno on Sept. 2
before cutting her own arms.
Relatives told the Los Ange-
les Times the 37-year-old mother
recently lost her job, could not make
mortgage payments on her Sun Val-
ley home, and had been hospitalized
for stress. Gomez also has a 14-year-
old daughter who was not at the
home at the time of the killings.
Bail was denied and Gomez'
arraignment was reset for Sept. 17.

Obama tries to shift dialogue on health care

In speech before
Congress, President
lays out his plan
WASHINGTON (AP) - Shaking
off a summer of setbacks, President
Barack Obama summoned Con-
gress to enact sweeping health care
legislation last night, declaring the
"time for bickering is over" and the
moment has arrived to protect mil-

lions who have unreliable insur-
ance or no coverage at all.
Obamasaid the changeshe wants
would cost about $900 billion over
decade, "less than we have spent
on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,
and less than the tax cuts for the
wealthiest few Americans" passed
during the Bush administration.
In a televised speech to a joint
session of Congress, Obama spoke
in favor of a provision for the fed-
eral government to sell insurance

in competition with private indus-
try. But in a remark certain to dis-
please liberals, he did not insist on
it, and said he was open to other
alternatives that create choices for
consumers.
Obama said he remains ready
to listen to all ideas but added in a
clear reference to Republicans, "I
will not;waste time with those who
have made the calculation that it's
better politics to kill this plan than
to improve it."

In an unusual outburst from
the Republican side of the House
chamber, Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C.,
shouted out "You lie" when the
president said illegal immigrants
would not benefit from his propos-
als. The president paused briefly
and smiled, but from her seat in the
visitor's gallery, first lady Michelle
Obama shook her head from side to
side in disapproval of the interrup-
tion. Wilson later apologized for
his "lack of civility."

In general, the president shied
away from providing lawmakers
with a list of particulars he wants
to see included in the legislation,
and there was nothing in the
speech to invite comparisons with
Bill Clinton's pen-waving veto
threat more than a decade ago on
health care.
Obama's speech came as the
president and his allies in Congress
readied an autumn campaign to
enact his top domestic priority.


TEXTBOOKS
From Page 1A
that it was going to make buying
textbooks cheaper."
Business sophomore Sara Jablow
said Shaman Drum was useful for
finding specialty and humanities
books, but she ultimately avoided
the store because of its high prices.
"Now people just have to buy
their books online," she said.
"Which is still easy and usually
cheaper anyway."
But despite the wide availability of
books online, many students still pre-
fer to purchase their books at a store
wheretheyknowtheyareguaranteed
to find the right edition and text.
"It's tough to get the right books

when there are a lot of editions of
the same one online," LSA sopho-
more Nicole Simovski said. "Plus
buying the books at a store like Sha-
man Drum was much easier than
spending a ton of time scouring the
Internet and hoping the book I or-
dered was in good shape."
Due to increasing complaints
about the financial burden text-
books place on students, some fac-
ulty like Ray McDaniel, an English
lecturer, have opted to use only ma-
terials that can be accessed by the
faculty and students for free.
"I no longer use textbooks of any
kind in any of my classes," said
McDaniel. "My students reported
the financial burden as unbear-
able. I now onlyuse materials that
are either in the public domain or

held in creative commons."
McDaniel's attitude signifies not
only a change in the textbook envi-
ronment, but also demonstrates the
very behavior that Pohrt said con-
tributed to Shaman Drum's demise.
Pohrt said the loss of Shaman
Drum's textbook sales, as well as
the store's other offerings, will have
a negative impact on campus. He
said the community will also miss
the author readings and workshops
it once hosted and the artsy flare
the shop provided on State Street.
"I argued that it was good to have
a store like that because it made it a

more vibrant and intellectual com-
munity in Ann Arbor."
In the wake of Shaman Drum's
closing, Pohrt uses the bookstore's
website to urge the community to
support other independent book-
shops in Ann Arbor, like Crazy Wis-
dom and Vault of Midnight, in light
of the troubles independent book-
stores are facing.
Because they were not involved
in the textbook industry, these oth-
er local businesses have not faced
the same problems that doomed
Shaman Drum.
In an effort to keep Shaman

Drum's presence on campus, Pohrt
applied for nonprofit status with
the IRS in March 2008, planning to
re-brand the business as the Great
Lakes Literary Arts Center. With
the nonprofit status, he would have
been eligible for government grants
and tax-deductible donations.
He was granted the nonprofit
status, but the business went un-
der before he could follow through
with his original goals. However,
his statement on the shop's web-
site indicates that he still intends
to pursue the Arts Center but as a
separate venture.

A canne ap proach
Amethyst Initiative needed to confront binge drinking
Based on her opposition to Anheuser-Busch's "Fan Cans," it
would seem like President Mary Sue Coleman is concerned
about binge drinking. After the University sent a letter
objecting to the marketing ploy - which would produce beer cans
in blue and yellow and distribute them in the Ann Arbor area - the
beer company agreed not to sell them on campus. But no matter
how justified, Coleman's opposition to the Fan Cans is hypocritical.
If she wants to show real leadership on the issue of binge drinking,
she will reverse her position on the Amethyst Initiative - a sensible
petition that asks Congress to examine the issue of the drinking age

- and, at long last, sign it.
As part of a marketing scheme to appeal
to the college-aged beer drinker, Anheuser-
Busch decided to produce Bud Light cans
decorated with the colors of 27 targeted
universities - the University of Michigan
among them. After the University sent a
complaint to Anheuser-Busch alleging that
such a ploy would increase the prevalence
of binge drinking on campus, the company
agreed not to sell the beer in the Univer-
sity community. But the University went
further, insisting in another letter that the
University community is not limited to its
campus, and that Anheuser-Busch should
not sell the Fan Cans anywhere in the state
of Michigan.
Such insistence should indicate that the
University administration is taking the
problem of binge drinking seriously. But
Coleman's absolute refusal tosign the Ame-
thyst Initiative is sending mixed messages.
It's hard to imagine that the University
is really interested in dealing with binge
drinking when reevaluating the drinking
age isn't even on the table.
The Amethyst Initiative, introduced in
July 2008 and signed by 135 college presi-
dents, does not call for the drinking age to
be lowered. It simply asks Congress to reex-
amine the issue and determine whether
the current drinking age of 21 is a success-

ful policy. This is a legitimate question -
since the drinking age was changed to 21 in
1984 under the National Minimum Drink-
ing Age Act, there has been an increase in
deaths and accidents related to underage
and binge drinking.
Generating discussion about the respon-
sible age for drinking and its connection to
binge drinkingshould never be discouraged.
And considering Coleman's background as
a researcher, it's especially troubling that
she would not agree with an initiative that
only asks for more study to be done on the
relationship between binge drinking and
the current drinking age. Her absolute
rejection of the Amethyst Initiative shows
not only that she stands steadfastly behind
a drinking age that may be unhealthy, but
also that her support for researching new
ideas and possibilities is dishonest.
Taken in stride, the University's strong
reaction to Anheuser-Busch's Fan Cans is
hardly demonstrative of a serious commit-
ment to reducing binge drinking. The Ame-
thyst Initiative is an attempt to deal with
one of the biggest issues on college cam-
puses. Until Coleman's signature is among
the many who have already expressed sup-
port for the initiative, any expressed inter-
est in preventing binge drinking can hardly
be taken seriously.

I am not the first president to take up this cause,
but I am determined to be the last."
- President Barack Obama, referring to his plan to reform
health care, in a speech delivered last night to Congress.

ognize it as such.

Keep smoking on campus

to hard to disagree with the
fact that smoking cigarettes
is an injurious and potentially
annoying habit.
State legislators are
negotiating a ban
on indoor smoking
in most Michigan
businesses in an
effort to protect the
health of employ-
ees and patrons
from the hazards
associated with HARSHA
secondhand smok-
ing. This is thought
by many to be valid
and sensible leg-
islation. But the University's ban on
smoking throughout campus - set to
take effect in July of 2011 - cannot be
described as such.
The innumerable health risks of
cigarette smoke are well known. Peo-
ple who smoke cigarettes, especially
University students, should be aware
of the consequences. A smoking ban
doesn't introduce any new informa-
tion that may encourage an individual
to not start or stop smoking. Chiding
smokers serves no practical purpose
other than to annoy the target.
The main cited reason for the
University's smoking ban is decreas-
ing exposure to secondhand smoke.
Outdoor secondhand smoke is not
completely safe: exposure to it while
sitting next to a smoker for extended
periods of time is harmful. But cam-
pus is not a stagnant location. Many
people walk to class while smoking or
take smoke breaks outside of univer-
sity buildings. So while it's true that

smoke may be inhaled while entering
a building, it's not a health risk - it's
simply an irritation.
Banning a habit for merely being
irritating would be discriminatory,
which sets an intolerable and unfair
precedent. Smoking has an excessive-
ly negative stigma in our society in
comparison to other equally bad and
disgusting behaviors. Obesity has
very similar health risks to smoking:
heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
Still, following this logic, the criti-
cism received by an overweight per-
son eating a rich dessert is not even
comparable to the scolding often ini-
tiated by lighting a cigarette. But a
policy has not been suggested to limit
food types and intake of people in the
University dining halls. People can
eat what they want, and some choose
five slices of pizza and three cookies.,
Following the logic of the smoking
ban, wouldn't limitations on eating
habits improve the health of the over-
all campus? Why has this never been
proposed? Because such a policy,
were it suggested, would be called
laughable, ludicrous and would be
met with an uproar of protest from
students.
Such outrage would not be with-
out good reason. A food intake policy
would greatly impinge on the per-
sonal liberty of both the students
and employees of the University and
violate the principles upon which the
United States was founded. A smok-
ing ban would have a similar effect.
A smoking ban sets a dangerous
precedent for what may follow. That
means standing and talking loudly
on a cell phone in a crowd of people

could be banned because it disrupts
the atmosphere on campus. In reality,
professors may enforce no cell-phone
policies in their classroom since
banter on the phone interferes with
learning, but a cell phone policy could
not be implemented campus-wide
since it's a public area. This makes
any ban on a legal and personal activ-
ity an egregious violation of students'
rights. As a taxpayer-funded institu-
tion, the University should be an all-
inclusive environment. The ban on
smoking contradicts this principle.

4

A smoking ban is
unhealthy for
students' rights.
But even aside from the question of
fairness, the ban would be difficult to
enforce and its effectiveness is doubt-
ful. There is no proposed fine for ban-,
ning smoking on campus,leaving very
little incentive to follow the policy.
This makes having such a policy on
the books even moire ridiculous.
All people have their flaws and
failings: smoking is just one of these
flaws. The President of the United
States even admits to smoking the
occasional cigarette as he battles his
addiction. Regardless, an annoying
habit should not be banned for minor
convenience.

'M' clips Eagles i three sets

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writer
YPSILANTI - Not even a lit-
tle blood could keep the Eastern
Michigan volleyball student sec-
tion from sticking around until the
end of last night's match against
No. 7 Michigan.
Down 4-1 in the second set, Eagle
sophomore Cassie Sowers dove for
a Michigan kill, but instead of com-
ing up with a dig, she left the hard-
wood with a bloody cut above her
left eye.
Sowers' gutsy effort proved
futile as the Wolverines (6-0) even-
tually went on an 8-1 run, winning
the set 25-11.
"One of our goals tonight was
to really develop some depth in
our team," Michigan coach Mark
Rosen said. "Tonight, in games
one and two we were really able
to do that. We didn't experience
any drop-offs in our team's per-
formance.
"Our experienced players did
a really good job playing at a high
level to help those less-experienced
players. Those less-experienced
players then did a nice job of play-
ing their role on the court."
At the end of the second set,
most of the Eastern Michigan
cheering section scattered from
the Convocation Center to grab
free Eastern Michigan football
tickets, leaving only a handful of
students for most of the third set.
With the Eagles (0-8) up 24-22 in
the frame and a potential fourth
set looming, Rosen finally called
his team over to the sideline.

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
He ran for 4,232 yards on 469
carries in high school, averaging
nine yards a touch and a touchdown
every nine chances.
He received a Parade Magazine
All-America selection as a senior
at Heard County High School in
Georgia and then enrolled early at
Michigan, with his speed the talk of
spring practice.
He was considered the fifth-
best running back in the nation by
Rivals.com and Scout.com, a few
spots behind former Ohio State run-
ning back Chris "Beanie" Wells and
a bit ahead of former Georgia Bull-
dog Knowshon Moreno, both first-
round NFL draft picks.
He was supposed to be the next
Michigan star running back.
But after three seasons and one
game, senior Carlos Brown has car-
ried the ball just 130 times for 599
yards and four touchdowns. He
is known for two things: fleeting
moments of brilliance and being
constantly hampered by injuries.
His first season-opening start in
four years was last Saturday against
Western Michigan.
"It felt great," Brown said about
starting the season healthy. "I'm
just hoping that it continues injury-

free all year, hopefully."
That game - where he ran for 54
yardson10-carries -wasagreat dis-
play of what the Wolverine coaching
staff wants out ofBrown this season.
He made second downs manage-
able with his positive-yard gains,
and Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
praised Brown's pass protecting.
Most importantly, he stayed healthy
in the absence of injured senior run-
ning back Brandon Minor.
Though he didn't have the typical
long, breakaway run that's become
his M.O., Brown played much more
consistently when carrying the ball
than in the past.
So far, it seems like the doors are
open for Brown to have the season
he's always been meant to have.
His next big opportunity to shine
is this weekend with Minor's ankle
still not 100 percent and a relatively
weak Notre Dame run defense. Last
week against the Irish, Nevada run-
ning back Vai Taua posted 114 yards
on 18 carries.
Brown will have the chance to
put together solid back-to-back
games for the first time in a couple
years. Last season, a wrist problem
and then an ankle injury limited his
playing time.
He was in the spotlight for just 60
minutes, and that was in the Wolver-
ines' last home game of the season

against Northwestern. He rushed
for 119 yards and earned his only
start of the season the next week
against Ohio State, during which he
proceeded to run for three yards on
three chances.
"It was very frustrating, because
it was something like I don't have
control, you know?" Brown said. "I
came in here everyday, got treat-
ments, justtrying to getback as soon
as possible. But it's a whole lot better
to be out there with the team and be
able to contribute.
"It's not like I just go and trip over
stuff and try to fall, you know?"
For Brown to continue to get
significant playing time even after
Minor returns from injury, he will
have to play like he did in 2007.
That season, with former Wolver-
ine Mike Hart and Minor sidelined,
Brown took over in the second half
of the Purdue game, rushing for 66
yards and two touchdowns.
The next two weeks, he put up
113 yards on a stingy Illinois defense
that hadn't let a running back gain
100 yards in a game all season, and
then 132 yards and two more touch-
downs against Minnesota.
Brown says he's happy as long as
the offense is clicking, but Michigan
fans will only be happy if Brown can
stay healthy and redeem a career
that has seemingly slipped away.

next four points and the match.

ing the stretch to catch the Eagles

"In set three, we didn't execute
that well," Rosen said. "Our play-

insurgency as the other two sets
and we didn't serve the ball as
tough.... It's nice to see at the end

Vaccine priority groups
altered plan for campus

From Page 1A
the University's planning.
"Suddenly our whole campus be-
came a priority group," Ernst said.
"That change kind of pushed back
our plans."
UHS originally made arrange-
ments to vaccinate priority groups
like pregnant women and health
care providers this fall, thinking that
students would not be eligible to re-
ceive immunization until the spring.
"When the priority groups
changed to include the college stu-
dents, we've had to accelerate our
plans to come up with strategies
that would allow for mass vaccina-
tion for the whole campus," Ernst
said.
According to Winfield, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control deter-
mined the priority groups based on
two factors: who gets infected and
who is at risk of death.
Currently, pregnant women are
the first on the list to get vaccinated,
followed by caregivers of children
younger than six months, health
care providers and emergency per-
sonnel, individuals ages six months
to 24, and individuals ages 25 to 64
who have high risk factors.
Winfield said he expects the
groups to change due to the amount
of H1N1 vaccine on hand.
"What we think will happen is
that there won't be enough vaccine,
and they will have to narrow those
guidelines," he said.
Winfield cited the CDC had
dropped its original estimate of 160
million doses of the vaccine being
available by Oct. 15. That figure has
since been reduced to 45 million,
according to The Associated Press.
The reduction appears to be a delay
rather than a shortage though, as
20 million more doses are expected
to be shipped out every week after
that Oct. 15 date, according to the
deport.
When the vaccine comes out, it
will be free of charge for students.
Additionally, public health offi-
cials expect H1N1 will require two
vaccinations about two to three
weeks apart.
Ernst said the second shot could
make it difficult to keep track of
student vaccinations.
"If you imagine we have 40,000
students, and they all become pri-
ority for H1N1 and they all need

two shots plus the seasonal flu shot,
that's starting to sound pretty com-
plicated," he said.
He added that UHS will not be
able to accommodate every stu-
dent seeking vaccinations and that
faculty and students in the health
sciences schools and the health
service are working together to
provide seasonal flu and HINT vac-
cinations.
Because influenza shots are in-
jected in a muscle, a medical degree
is not required to administer the
vaccine. As long as a health official
supervises them, Nursing and Pub-
lic Health students can volunteer to
give the shot to fellow students.
Cindra James, emergency pre-
paredness coordinator at the
Washtenaw County Public Health
Department, said the department
will also recruit University stu-
dents and students from Washt-
enaw Community College to help
administer the vaccine to county
residents.
All vaccine orders from hospitals
and private medical providers will
be shipped to the Health Depart-
ment, which will receive weekly
shipments of the vaccine based on
its availability. The providers will
then coordinate with the depart-
ment to arrange delivery or pick-up.
Although the county's Public
Health Department does not yet
know how many doses it will re-
ceive, James said it has been pre-
paring by purchasing more refrig-
erators to store the vaccine and
working with clinics, homeless
agencies and jails to ensure every-
one in Washtenaw County has ac-
cess to the immunization.
Additionally, the Health Depart-
ment is working with the public and
private schools in the area so they
know how to handle any outbreaks.
"We're working with the schools
to make sure they know they don't
have to close down if H1N1 appears
with their school," James said. "But
they have to work with the parents
to inform them how long to keep
kids at home."
On campus, UHS is encouraging
students to get vaccinated for both
H1N1 and the seasonal flu.
"We expect that there will be
seasonal flu like there is every year,"
Ernst said, "and the H1N1 will pres-
ent in very similar ways, so it's not
going to be very clear if people do

get sick whether or not it's H1N1 or
seasonal flu, so anything people can
do to protect themselves from get-
ting sick we think is a good idea:'
LSA sophomore Josh Symes is
considered at risk for getting H1N1
because he has asthma. Although
he said he usually gets vaccinated
for the seasonal flu and plans on
getting the H1Nt vaccine as an ex-
tra precaution, he's not too con-
cerned about a massive outbreak on
campus.
"I haven't thought about it
enough to get worried about it," he
said.
While only high-risk patients
like Symes will receive medication
if they become infected with H1N1,
all students with the virus will be
asked to wear a mask, which will
be provided in the residence halls.
Logan said the masks are to prevent
healthy students from contracting
the illness.
"We are going to ask students
who are sick to wear a mask when
their roommate is present so as not
to expose them to the droplets of
moisture from sneezes or coughs
that can carry the virus," he said.
Additionally, non-alcohol based
hand sanitizer will be placed in res-
idence hall lobbies, dining halls and
community centers.
In another attempt to reduce the
spread of germs, University Hous-
ing is trying a new tactic that asks
students who eat at the Hill Dining
Center to swipe their own MCard
before entering the cafeteria, in-
stead of a dining hall employee.
"Our greeters typically wear pro-
tective gloves; but any germs from
one card that are picked up on the
greeters' gloves may be passed on to
the next card," Logan wrote in an e-
mail interview. "So having students
swipe their own meal cards reduces
the back-and-forth exchange of mul-
tiple cards through the greeters."
Logan added that the trial effort
has been well-received by students
dining in Mosher-Jordan Residence
Hall, and University Housing plans
to try it at other dining centers.

mal time with our students, help
us celebrate our anniversary and
groundbreaking, and root for the
Maize and Blue," Caminker wrote
in the letter.
In addition to the other oppor-
tunities, the Law School offered
Roberts a $15,000 honorarium. In
response to the Daily's information
request, the University's Freedom
of Information Act Coordinator Pa-
tricia Sellinger wrote that Roberts
did not accept the offer.
"Please note, that the honorari-
um offer was extended as a courtesy
and the Law School did not expect
Chief Justice Roberts to accept it;"
Sellinger wrote, "in a verbal conver-
sation, representatives for the Chief
Justice have confirmed that he will
not accept the honorarium offer."
Margaret Leary, director and li-
brarian of the Law Library, said the
event with Roberts will be an infor-
mal question-and-answer session
with Caminker, allowing for the
possibility of spontaneous ques-
tions.I
Roberts is at least the third Su-
preme Court justice to visit the Law
School in the last five years.

perience program will address the
"slump," which is common for sec-
ond-year students grappling with
academic and social life questions.
"Through SYE, Housing has an-
swered sophomores' cry for help,"
he said at the ceremony.
Linda Newman, University
Housing director, said though it
was a big change to welcome male
residents to Stockwell for the first
time, Housing officials were happy
to do it.
"Students asked for it and we
were able to give it to them," she
said.
Alice Berberian Haidostian, who
lived in Stockwell from 1943 until
1946 and attended the ceremony,
said the residence hall becoming
co-ed doesn't concern her.
"You just expect everyone to be

Leary said some of the events
are already sold out, and others
have limited availability. She added
that officials have already changed
venues for the Roberts event due to
demand from Law School students,
alumni and faculty.
"Chief Justice Roberts was origi-
nally scheduled for 100 Hutchins
Hall that holds maybe 350 people.
We got more than that, so we moved
it to Rackham ... and then we filled
Rackham, so we moved it to Hill,"
she said.
In addition to giving the Law
School community a chance to in-
teract with Roberts, the sesquicen-
tennial will celebrate the school's
achievements, like its international
diversity, Leary said.
"(The sesquicentennial) means a
lot, because one of the qualities this
law school has that makes it stand
out from most other law schools is
that we're old," Leary said. "We've
been around since 1859. We've al-
ways been a large law school. Dur-
ing the end of the 19th century the
largest law school title was bounc-
ing around between Columbia Law
School and Michigan Law School.
We're also celebrating the fact that
we are a public institution, which
takes public service very seriously."
Other scheduled events for the
gentleman and ladies," she said.
She added that it was a different
change that surprised her the most.
"No dining room? That's the big
change," Haidostian said.
Another University alum in at-
tendance, Pauline Walters, said de-
spite the renovation, the building
doesn't look much different from
when she lived there from 1947 to
1950.
"This is still as beautiful as it was
when I first came here," she said.
Newman said keeping the histor-
ical character of the building was a
priority during the renovation.
"The juxtaposition of new and
old embodied in the renovation of
Stockwell Hall is part of the very
character of this University," she
said during the ceremony.
E. Royster Harper, vice president
for student affairs, called the reno-
vation "a dream come true."
"It is particularly fitting that we

weekend include a gala dinner, a
talk given by Leary -- who also hap-
pens to be an expert on William
Cook, the largest donor in the his-
tory of the Law School -- and a live
screening of the Notre Dame game
in the Law Quad.
"We will have tents set up, which
will already have been set up for the
lunch on Friday. And we're going to
have giant monitors, giant screens,
and that will be also basically a tick-
eted event," Leary said.
According to Leary, Roberts
plans to attend the football game at
the Big House.
The event will also include cele-
bratingagroundbreakingceremony
for the Law School's new academic
building and Law School Com-
mons, where University President
Mary Sue Coleman and Caminker
are expected to make remarks. Rob-
erts will be in attendance.
The four-day celebration also
highlights the University's global
leadership in the law, an aspect of
the school that, Leary says, is as old
as the school itself.
"I think we're also celebrating,
as the logo says, 150 years of global
leadership in law," Leary said.

She added that she was particu-
larly excited to reopen Stockwell a
year after cutting the ribbon on the
Hill Dining Center and with the
knowledge that the grand opening
of North Quad is only a year away.
"I am really having a moment

Varilone said he's excited to call
the brand new residence hall home,
adding that he feels privileged to be
one of Stockwell's first male resi-

said. "There's tons of space to do

What are the five strangest theater
productions you've ever seen?
"Fragments From A Trilogy: The Trojan Women" by Andrei Serban at
Cafe LaMama in 1974. It was the first time I saw a multi-national multi-ethnic
cast. There was incredible physicality. The text was comprised of different lan-
guages.
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" by Peter Brook at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music. Fantastic physicality - it used a circus theme with trapezes and acro-
batics. An inspiration for any director of Shakespeare.
"Yerma" by Rogaland Teatr at the International Theater Festival in Balti-
more, 1982. Done in a bullfight ring with Norwegian actors playing Spaniards
and blond actresses painting mustaches on their upper lips.
"Richard III" by Konstantine Raikin at Satyricon Theater in Moscow, 2005.
Great use of symbolic language - the death of Clarence is a wine-throwing
match, the prince's pillow fight on a ballooning fabric "bed," while the feathers
float above them.
"The Tempest" by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Power Center
in Fall 2006. Setting was Antarctica and the character of Ariel was played like
Nosferatu. This concept did not work for me - the power balance was wrong -
Ariel was scarier than Caliban and more powerful than Prospero.

The summer of 2009 belongs to Aubrey "Drake" Graham. Reeling from recent
success with his summer hit"Best I Ever Had," the Canadian-born "Degrassi" alum
has been premiering a stringof monster R&B singles in anticipation of his upcoming
debut Thank Me Later. His latest offering is "Forever," a six-minute smash featuring
an epic lineup of hip-hop royalty. With guest appearances by Kanye, Weezy and
Detroit's finest, the song seems like it should be an incomprehensible mishmash of
heavy hitters, but the combination works. With a steady stream of successful early
releases, Drake is on his way to making his name as a hip-hop powerhouse.

A celebration for Ann
Arbor bibliophiles

Coffee: the experience

BookFest features
book writing, printing
and consumption
By MOLLY MCGUIRE
Daily Arts Writer
The finest members of the Ann Arbor literati will
be hitting the brick and cobblestone
streets of Kerrytown this Sunday for
a day filled with books, high-pow- Kerrytown
ered discussion, a touch of mystery B0kFst
and some delicious and belletristic
confections. It's the seventh annual Sunday
Kerrytown BookFest and, as always, 11 a.m. -5 p.m.
there's a frenzy of book-related Around Kerrytown
activities planned for the day. The Farmers' Market
activities, which begin at 11 a.m., are
centered at the Farmers' Market.
Although the program for the book festival changes
every year, its focus is always the same: the celebration
of reading and Ann Arbor's thriving book culture. In
addition to all the authors and distinguished speakers
who flock to the BookFest, at the heart of the festival
are those who actually create books. The likes of book-
binders, papermakers, letterpress printers and book
artists will be there, some of them showcasing their
craft for visitors.
"There's a big focus on the book arts," President
of the Bookfest Board Robin Agnew, who owns Aunt
Agatha's Mystery Bookshop downtown, said. "It's a
really unusual additional focus for our event."
"Culinary Michigan" is this year's theme, and events
on the topic take up about half of the programming.
Drawing in local food connoisseurs along with gastro-
nomes from out of town, the BookFest will have panels
headed by culinary celebrities. Take for instance Jane
and Michael Stern, the "Roadfood" adventurers from
National Public Radio's "The Splendid Table." They'll
be participating in a panel called "Local Foods in the
World and Global Foods in Michigan" along with Ari
Weinzweig, co-owner of Zingerman's, and Jan Lon-
gone, the University of Michigan Clements Library
culinary historian. And this panel is only one of many
- the rest of the topics are as varied as food blogging in
"Eating Online" and gastronomic whodunits in "Mys-
teries to Cook By."
The Sterns also have a cake job set up judging the
Edible Book Contest. The rules to this contest - which
unites food and literature - are simple. Turn your
favorite novel, author or character into something
edible. Puns are encouraged. For example, "if you had
a beer mug with a hot dog in it, that would be Franken-
stein," Agnew explained. The hottest contenders will
duke it out for such awards as Most Book-Like, Pun-
Intended and Best in Show.
But it's not all about food at this year's BookFest.
SUMMER STORIES
From Page 1B
"Drag Me To Hell"
 The greatest horror film of the summer featured
director Sam Raimi returning to his roots with a ven-
geance. His film "Drag Me To Hell" was a mixture of
gross-out comedy and extremely horrific visuals. One
minute the audience is laughing, the next it's scream-
ing, and the whole thing is way more fun than a horror
film has any right to be. Perhaps there's life in Ameri-
can horror films after all?
"Inglourious Basterds"
Quentin Tarantino's latest film is the most impor-
tant film of the summer, simply because it's by far the
most adventurous, creative and entertaining. "Inglou-
rious Basterds" combines gruesome violence, Brad Pitt
with a funny accent and the best re-writing of history
ever seen in a movie. As always, Tarantino chooses to
let his words do the real heavy lifting, and his dialogue
here is endlessly quotable. It's bravura filmmaking at
its finest, and certainly another Tarantino's master-
piece.
Disney Buys Marvel
Disney bought Marvel Entertainment for $4 bil-

lion, acquiring the rights to more than 5,000 char-
acters, from Iron Man to Baron Von Blitzschlag. But
don't worry about Goofy joining the Fantastic Four
or Wolverine's violent rampages being toned down.
Instead expect more support for films featuring mid-
level heroes like Hawkeye and Namor. That said, you
can worry about the consolidation of the entertain-
ment industry.
Summer Festivals
Starting with May's Coachella, which landed Paul
McCartney, to June's Bonnaroo, which landed The
Boss and Phish (twice), headliners at music fests this
summer seemed surprisingly, well, old. Though Chi-
cago dominated the outdoor hipster music scene with
Pitchfork and Lollapalooza boasting headliners like
Grizzly Bear, Kings of Leon, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the
Flaming Lips, other headlining spots (Nine Inch Nails,
Jane's Addiction, Tool) saw tenured acts favored over
today's tastemakers. The Nineties, it seems, are catch-
ing up to us - and quickly.
"The Hangover"
This is a movie about the kind of night everybody
wants to have. That is, if your idea of a night to remem-
ber is waking up with Mike Tyson's tiger in the bath-
room and a baby named Carlos in the closet. The actors
all work well together to form a lineup that could rival
those in movies like "Wedding Crashers" and "Old
School." If nothing else, "The Hangover" will be giving
students lines to recite for the rest of their lives.

Once they're full, visitors will find the rest of the pro-
gramming offers a wide variety of guests and activi-
ties. Mystery buffs are lucky this year - headlining is
Jeffery Deaver, bestselling writer and author of "The
Bone Collector," who is set to speak at 4 p.m. Continu-
ing along the same hardboiled lines, there will be a
true crime panel featuring writers Mardi Link, Patrick
Brode, Steve Miller and Andrea Billups. Moderated by
writer and blogger Laura James, the panelwill focus on
true crime writing, both contemporary and historical.
There are still dozens of things to do for those
ambivalent about mysterysolving. Aspiring journalists
and newspaper enthusiasts biting their nails over fold-
ing publications might want to check out "The Future
of Print Journalism." Speakers from the Ann Arbor
Chronicle, Annarbor.com, The Ann Arbor Observer,
The Detroit News and USA Today will address the
seemingly grim outlook and share their predictions
on what's to come. There will also be a panel discus-
sion on "Counterculture and Music of the '60s," where
a biography of Ann Arbor native Bob Seger is one of the
featured books.
In addition, Michigan Notable Book Award Winner
Mary Ellen Geist will speak about her winning book,
"Measure of the Heart," which details the relation-
ship between a father with Alzheimer's disease and his
daughter. Lastly, students might recognize some Uni-
versity professors in the crowd, as husband and wife
writing teams Michael Byers and Susan Hutton, as well
as Peter Ho Davies and Lynne Raughley, talk about
their work and their experience as literary couples.
For a more hands-on approach, there's the Hol-
lander's Outdoor Mini Workshops. Visitors can make
collages, recipe books and even papyrus. It's not only
for adults, though - there's an entire children's tent
devoted to crafts for kids like paper making and paper
marbling. And of course there's no children's tent with-
out storytime. Authors Heather O'Neal and John Perry
will come by for a reading, and so will Mother Goose.
In recent years, the BookFest has been wildly popu-
lar, with turnouts of around 4,000 visitors and more
than 100 exhibitors. With the well-known headliners
this year, the seventh annual BookFest promises to
match that and more. And it makes sense: Ann Arbor,
with over 30 bookstores and an exciting literary com-
munity, is the perfect place for a crisp September Sun-
day with the best and brightest from the book world.
"It's a really great way to expose everyone in the
community to writers and to book arts, and just to a lot
of things that go in Ann Arbor that people don't know
about," Agnew said.
The Kerrytown BookFest comes but once a year. "It
takes all year to plan," Agnew explained. So take this
Sunday to go see all literary Ann Arbor has to offer -
mingle with all the erudite exhibitors who do so much
to create everything we read, pick up a snazzy copy of
a book for school and learn about true crime writing
and bookbinding. You might even get a piece ofcake for
your trouble.

'THE BOYS NEXT DOOR' (1985)

'Boys' gone wild

By BRANDON CONRADIS
Senior Arts Editor
Roy (Maxwell Caulfield,
"Empire Records") and Bo (Charlie
Sheen, "Platoon") seem like ordi-
nary boys. They go to high school,
drink booze, play pranks on their
teachers and dread the burden
of post-graduation life, including
having to work in the local fac-
tory. But beneath their wholesome
facades are two deeply disturbed
sociopaths waiting to cut loose.
Roy is an unhinged maniac con-
stantly on the verge of boiling over
into violent rage. Bo is his unques-
tioning follower.
"The Boys Next Door" is essen-
tially a day in the life of these two
young loose cannons, who take a
road trip to Los Angeles one night
and soon find themselves the tar-
gets of a city-wide manhunt when
their joyride turns into a murder
spree.
It's a difficult film to watch at
times. In the wake of recent school
shootings like the 2007 spree at
Virginia Tech, it's hard to imag-
ine a film like this being received
with open arms by contemporary
mainstream critics. Even for a
film made in 1985, it's remarkably
subversive. While most moviego-
ers in 1985 were being spoon-fed
patriotic fluff like "Red Dawn" and
"Rambo: First Blood Part II," "The
Boys Next Door" dared to show
the angrier side of Reagan-era
America.

mended more as a curiosity than
it is as a genuine diamond in the
