CSG president,

By GIACOMO BOLOGNA

It was only a few hours ear-
lier that his flight touched down
in Michigan, but Central Stu-
dent Government President
Manish Parikh made sure he
was at assembly's first meeting
of the semester on Jan.15.
After a frenzied CSG presi-
dential election in March that
left candidates and their sup-
porters completely immersed in
student government, Parikh -
who won a plurality of the stu-
dent vote after barely escaping
disqualification from the elec-
tion - faces a similarly hectic
schedule every day.
A typical weekday for
Parikh can entail responding
to 50 to 60 e-mails, attending
as many as five meetings and
doing other student govern-

days totals eight to nine hours
- all of which results in about
five hours of sleep, he said.
Former CSG President
DeAndree Watson, who now
works in the office of Charles
Pugh, president of the Detroit
City Council, said such is the
life of a student body presi-

"Whenever I wasn't in class

sacrifices" were made. He said
that being a student and student

Group brings
sex discussion to
informal setting
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
LSA sophomore Adam Mol-
nar is the leader of Sex Forum,
a Residential College student
forum that discusses mastur-
bation, fetishes and a myriad of
other topics that would make
most high school sex education
teachers blush,
His parents are okay with it.
"They're all for it; they
thought it was a good idea,"
Molnar said. "They also don't
understand why it's so hard
to receive sexual information
that's not from an awkward,
older adult figure."
That's just one goal of Sex
Forum which is in its seventh
year. The group educates its
members on contraceptives
and safe sex practices, often
using demonstrative condoms
and dental dams. There are also
occasional field trips to Ann
Arbor's Safe Sex Store.
"Last meeting they asked
us what we wanted to learn.
about," Irani said "Topics var-
ied from BDSM to asexual-
ity to sexual fetishes,.and it all

sounds so interestingto me."
At each meeting, the 10-per-
son group discusses a few
issues selected by forum mem-
bers. Molnar said an upcom-
ing meeting will discuss rape,
hook-up and college sex cul-
tures. In the past, the group has
watched documentaries on var-
ious topics including BDSM as
well as videos in the media that
portray gender roles unfairly.
RC forums are student
groups that focus on an inter-
ests including art, LGBTQ
issues or film. RC students can
get credit for their involvement,
and most courses meet for an
hour a week.
"It's also a place where
you're not receiving opinions
or, 'This is what I think,"' Mol-
nar said. "We're trying to give
each other facts. It's not just
like talking with your friends
like, 'So, what do you think
about this?' and just getting an
opinion that could be unsub-
stantiated."
One event at the forum is
the Gender Panel. The panel
consists of members of one sex
who respond to anonymous
questions from members of the
other sex.

75 years ago this week
(January 26th, 1938)
Henry S. Curtis, executive
secretary of the Huron-Clinton
Parkway committee, announced
public ownership of waterfronts
in towns bordering the Huron
River.
"River front is natural park
area," Curtis said in a radio
statement. "Throughout the
nation cities are takin& it over and
using it for recreational purposes
... the land is much more beautiful
when it is used as a recreation
area."
Curtis believed that all
stakeholders - including federal
and state governments, the six
counties and thirteen cities
affected, and industry, should

cooperate in puttingthe plan into
action.

five-year period, book use rose
from 414,756 the first year to
763,896 volumes this year."
Reniston also noted that book
use in other libraries throughout

the University increased after

would not plunge the country
back into authoritarianism.
"There is no going back on
freedom, democracy and the
supremacy ofthe law," he said.
The worst violence this week-
end was in the Mediterranean
coastal city of Port Said, where
seven people were killed on
Sunday, pushing the toll for two
days of clashes to at least 44.
The unrest was sparked on Sat-
urday by a court conviction and
death sentence for 21 defendants
involved in a mass soccer riot in
the city's main stadium on Feb. 1,
2012 that left 74 dead.
Most of those sentenced to
death were local soccer fans from
Port Said, deepening a sense of
persecution that Port Said's resi-
dents have felt since the stadium
disaster, the worst soccer vio-
lence ever in Egypt.
At least another 11 died on
Friday elsewhere in the country
during rallies marking the second
anniversary of the anti-Mubarak
uprising. Protesters used the
occasion to renounce Morsi
and his Islamic fundamentalist
group, the Muslim Brotherhood,
which emerged as the country's
most dominant political force
after Mubarak's ouster.
The curfew and state of emer-
gency, both in force for 30 days,
affect the provinces of Port Said,
Ismailiya and Suez. The curfew
takes effect Monday from 9 p.m.
to 6 a.m. every day.
Morsi, in office since June, also
invited the nation's political forc-
es to a dialogue starting Monday
to resolve the country's latest cri-
sis. A statement issued later by his
office said thatamong those invit-
ed were the country's top reform
leader, Nobel peace Laureate
Mohammed ElBaradei, former
Arab League chief Amr Moussa
and Hamdeen Sabahi, a leftist
politician who finished third in

230 people die in
crowded nightclub
with only one exit
PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil
(AP) - Flames raced through
a crowded nightclub in south-
ern Brazil early Sunday, kill-
ing more than 230 people as
panicked partygoers gasped
for breath in the smoke-filled
air, stampeding toward a single
exit partially blocked by those
already dead. It appeared to be
the world's deadliest nightclub
fire in more than a decade.
Witnesses said a flare or fire-
work lit by band members start-
ed the blaze in Santa Maria, a
university city of about 225,000
people, though officials said the
cause was still under investiga-
tion.
Television images showed
smoke pouring out of the Kiss
nightclub as shirtless young
men who had attended a uni-
versity party joined firefighters
using axes and sledgehammers
to pound at windows and walls
to free those trapped inside.
Guido Pedroso Melo, com-
mander of the city's fire
department, told the O Globo
newspaper that firefighters
had a hard time getting inside
the club because "there was a
barrier of bodies blocking the
entrance."
Teenagers sprinted from the
scene desperately seeking help.
Others carried injured and
burned friends away in their
arms.
"There was so much smoke
and fire, it was complete panic,
and it took a long time for peo-
ple to get out, there were so
many dead," survivor Luana
Santos Silva told the Globo TV
network.
The fire spread so fast inside
the packed club that firefighters
and ambulances could do little
to stop it, Silva said.
Another survivor, Michele
Pereira, told the Folha de S.

Paulo newspaper that she was
near the stage when members
of the band lit flares that started
the conflagration.
"The band that was onstage
began to use flares and, sudden-
ly, they stopped the show and
pointed them upward," she said.
"At that point, the ceiling caught
fire. It was really weak, but in a
matter of seconds it spread."
Guitarist Rodrigo Martins
told Radio Gaucha that the
band, Gurizada Fandangueira,
started playing at 2:15 a.m. "and
we had played around five songs
when I looked up and noticed
the roof was burning"
"It might have happened
because of the Sputnik, the
machine we use to create a
luminous effect with sparks.
It's harmless, we never had any
trouble with it.
"When the fire started, a
guard passed us a fire extin-
guisher, the singer tried to use it
but it wasn't working"
He confirmed that accordion
player Danilo Jacques, 28, died,
while the five other members
made it out safely.
Police Maj. Cleberson Braida
Bastianello said by telephone
that the toll had risen to 233
with the death of a hospitalized
victim - he said earlier that the
death toll was likely made worse
because the nightclub appeared
to have just one exit through
which patrons could exit.
Officials counted 232 bodies.
that had been brought for iden-
tification to a gymnasium in
Santa Maria, which is located at
the southern tip of Brazil, near
the borders with Argentina and
Uruguay.
Federal Health Minister
Alexandre Padhilha told a news
conference that most of the 117
people treated in hospitals had
been poisoned by gases they
breathed during the fire. Only
a few suffered serious burns, he
said.
Brazil President Dilma Rous-
seff arrived to visit the injured
after cutting short her trip to a

Latin American-European sum-
mit in Chile.
"It is a tragedy for all of us,"
Rousseff said.
Most of the dead apparently
were asphyxiated, according to
Dr. Paulo Afonso Beltrame, a
professor at the medical school
of the Federal University of
Santa Maria who went to the
city's Caridade Hospital to help
victims.
Beltrame said he was told the
club had been filled far beyond
its capacity during a party for
students at the university's
agronomy department.
Survivors, police and fire-
fighters gave the same account
of a band member setting the
ceiling's soundproofing ablaze,
he said.
"Large amounts of toxic
smoke quickly filled the room,
and I would say that at least 90
percent of the victims died of
asphyxiation," Beltrame told
The Associated Press by tele-
phone.
"The toxic smoke made peo-
ple lose their sense of direc-
tion so they were unable to find
their way to the exit. At least
SO bodies were found inside
a bathroom. Apparently they
confused the bathroom door
with the exit door."
In the hospital, the doctor
"saw desperate friends and rela-
tives walking and running down
the corridors looking for infor-
mation," he said, calling it "one
of the saddest scenes I have ever
witnessed."
Rodrigo Moura, identi-
fied by the newspaper Diario
de Santa Maria as a security
guard at the club, said it was
at its maximum capacity of
between 1,000 and 2,000, and
partygoers were pushing and
shoving to escape.
Santa Maria Mayor Cezar
Schirmer declared a 30-day
mourning period, and Tarso
Genro, the governor of the
southern state of Rio Grande do
Sul, said officials were investi-
gating the cause of the disaster.

from a prison where the gov-
ernment said 58 people were
killed in one of'the deadliest
prison clashes in the nation's

More than two days after the

an official death toll and said
46 wounded victims remained

wood scraps and sheets of zinc
where some inmates had taken
shelter in the overcrowded
prison.
Varela said that the violence
erupted on Friday when groups
of armed inmates began firing
shots at National Guard troops
who were attempting to carry
out an inspection.
"There was resistance to
what was imminent ... a peace-
ful inspection," Varela said,
adding that groups of prison-
ers had opened fire "on a large
scale."
Those killed included
inmates as well as two Prot-
estant pastors and one soldier,
she said. One victim's body was
burned, Varela said.
The death toll provided by
the government differed from
that given a day earlier by Dr.
Ruy Medina, director of Cen-

had said 61 were reported killed
and about 120 were wounded.
Medina said that nearly all of
the injuries were from gun-

ing where their relatives were

The riot was the latest in
a series of deadly clashes in
Venezuela's overcrowded and
often anarchical prisons, where
inmates typically obtain weap-
ons and drugs with the help of
corrupt guards. Critics called
it proof that the government is

Two-week-long
mission into Mali
targets extremists
SEVARE, Mali (AP) - French
and Malian forces pushed toward
the fabled desert town of Timbuk-
tu on Sunday, as the two-week-
long French mission gathered
momentum against the Islamist
extremists who have ruled the
north for more than nine months.
So far the French forces have
met little resistance from the mil-
itants, though it remains unclear
what battles may await them far-
ther north. The Malian military
blocked dozens of international
journalists from trying to travel
toward Timbuktu.
Lt. Col. DiarranKone, aspokes-
man for Mali's defense minister,
declined to give details Sunday
about the advance on Timbuktu,
citing the security of an ongoing
military operation.
Timbuktu's mayor, Ousmane
Halle, is in the capital, Bamako,
and he told The Associated Press
he had no information about the
remote town, where phone lines
have been cut for days.
A convoy of about 15 vehicles
transporting international jour-
nalists also was blocked Sunday
afternoon in Konna,' some 186
miles (300 kilometers) south of
Timbuktu.
The move on Timbuktu comes
a day after the French announced
they had seized the airport and
a key bridge in Gao, one of the
other northern .provincial capi-
tals under the grip of radical
Islamists.
"People were coming out into
the streets to greet tpe arrival of
the troops and celebrate," said
Hassane Maiga, a resident of
Gao. "At night, youth from Gao
went out alongside the Malian
military. They scoured homes in
search of the Islamists and the
youth smashed the houses."
French and Malian forces
were patrolling Gao Sunday
afternoon searching for rem-
nants of the Islamists and main-
taining control of the bridge
and airport, said Kone, the Mali
military spokesman.
The French special forces,
which had stormed in by land
and by air, had come under fire
in Gao from "several terror-
ist elements" that were later
"destroyed," the French mili-
tary said in a statement on its
website Saturday.
In a later press release entitled
"French and Malian troops liber-
ate Gao," the French ministry of
defense said they brought back
the town's mayor, Sadou Diallo,
who had fled to Bamako.
However, a Gao official inter-
viewed by telephone by The
Associated Press said late Sat-
urday that coalition forces so far
only controlled the airport, the
bridge and surrounding neigh-
hnl-.Ann^a in P-i.a aafrn

ministry official clarified that
the city had not been fully liber-
ated, and that the processoffree-
ing Gao was continuing.
Both officials insisted on ano-
nymity because they were not
authorized to speak publicly on
the matter.
Gao, the largest city in north-
ern Mali, was seized by a mix-
ture of al-Qaida-linked Islamist
fighters more than nine months
ago along with the other north-
ern provincial capitals of Kidal
and Timbuktu.
The rebel group that turned
Gao into a replica of Afghanistan
under the Taliban has close ties
to Moktar Belmoktar, the Alge-
rian national who has long oper-
ated in Mali and who last week
claimed responsibility for the
terror attack on a BP-operated
natural gas plant in Algeria.
His fighters are believed to
include Algerians, Egyptians,
Mauritanians, Libyans, Tuni-
sians, Pakistanis and even
Afghans.
Since France began its mili-
tary operation, the Islamists
have retreated from three small
towns in central Mali: Diabaly,
Konna and Douentza. However,
the Islamists still control much
of the north, including Kidal.
The Pentagon said late Satur-
day that Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta told France the United
States will aid the French mili-
tary with aerial refueling mis-
sions.
U.S. aerial refueling planes
would be a boost to air support
for French ground forces as they
enter vast areas of northern
Mali, which is the size of Texas,
that are controlled by al-Qaida-
linked extremists.
The U.S. was already helping
France by transporting French
troops and equipment to the
West African nation. However,
the U.S. government has said
it cannot provide direct aid to
the Malian military because the
country's democratically elected
president was overthrown in a
coup last March.
The Malian forces, however,
are now expected to get more
help than initially promised
from neighboring nations.
Col. Shehu UsmanAbdulkadir,
a Nigerian in charge of regional
forces heading to Mali, told The
Associated Press that the Afri-
can force will be expanded from
an anticipated 3,200 troops to
some 5,700 - a figure that does
not include the 2,200 soldiers
promised by Chad.
Most analysts had said the
earlier figure was far too small to
confront the Islamists given the
huge territory they hold.
The Mali conflict has been
dominating the African Union
summitinAddis Ababa,Ethiopia,
which runs through Monday. On
Sunday, U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon met in the Ethio-
pian capital with Mali's interim

UK Iawmaker:
Short skirts, high
* heels rape risk
A British lawmaker's sug-
gestion that young women who
wear high heels and short skirts
put themselves at greater risk of
rape has drawn widespread con-
demnation.
"If you are blind drunk and
wearing those clothes how able
are you to get away?" Conser-
vative Party lawmaker Rich-
ard Graham, of Gloucester, was
quoted as saying by his local
newspaper, The Citizen.
Anti-rape activists said Gra-
ham's comments smacked of
blaming rape victims for having
been assaulted.
But Graham said in a blog post
Saturday that his interview "in
no way intimates ANY excuse for
predatory behavior."
In further comments to The
Citizen, Graham said, "Risk
management is a million miles
from saying anything like 'she
was asking for it."'
Graham could not be reached

Auschwitz and across the world

Solemn prayers
mark Holocaust
Remembrance Day
WARSAW, Poland (AP) -
Holocaust survivors, politi-
cians, religious leaders and
others marked International
Holocaust Remembrance Day
on Sunday with solemn prayers
and the now oft-repeated
warnings to never let such hor-
rors happen again.
Events took place at sites
including Auschwitz-Birke-
nau, the former death camp
where Hitler's Germany
killed at least 1.1 million peo-
ple, mostly Jews, in southern
Poland. In Warsaw, prayers
were also held at a monument
to the fighters of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising of 1943.
Pope Benedict XVI, speak-
ing from his window at St.
Peter's Square at the Vatican,
warned that humanity must
always be on guard against a
repeat of murderous racism.
"The memory of this
immense tragedy, which above
all struck so harshly the Jew-
ish people, must represent for
everyone a constant warning
so that the horrors of the past
are not repeated, so that every
form of hatred and racism is
overcome, and that respect for,
and dignity of, every human
person is encouraged," the
German-born pontiff said.
Not all words spoken by dig-
nitaries struck the right tone,
however.
On the sidelines of a cer-
emony in Milan, former
Italian Premier Silvio Berlus-
coni sparked outrage when he
praised Benito Mussolini for
"having done good" despite
the Fascist dictator's anti-
Jewish laws. Berlusconi also
defended Mussolini for allying
himself with Hitler, saying he
likely reasoned that it would
be better to be on the winning
side.
The United Nations in 2005
designated Jan. 27 as a yearly
memorial day for the victims

of the Holocaust - 6 million
Jews and millions of other
victims of Nazi Germany dur-
ing World War II. The day was
chosen because it falls on the
anniversary of the liberation in
1945 of Auschwitz, the Nazis'
most notorious death camp
and a symbol of the evil inflict-
ed across the continent.
"Those who experienced the
horrors of the cattle cars, ghet-
tos, and concentration camps
have witnessed humanity at its
very worst and know too well
the pain of losing loved ones to
senseless violence," U.S. Presi-
dent Barack Obama said in a
statement.
Obama went on to say that
like those who resisted the
Nazis, "we must commit our-
selves to resisting hate and
persecution in all its forms.
The United States, along with
the international commu-
nity, resolves to stand in the
way of any tyrant or dictator
who commits crimes against
humanity, and stay true to the
principle of 'Never Again."'
As every year, Holocaust
survivors gathered in the cold
Polish winter at Auschwitz -
but they shrink in number each
year.
This year the key event in
the ceremonies was the open-
ing of an exhibition prepared
by Russian experts that depicts
Soviet suffering at the camp
and the Soviet role in liberat-
ing it. The 6pening was presid-
ed over by Sergey Naryshkin,
chairman of the Russian State
Duma.
Several years ago, Polish
officials stopped the opening
of a previous exhibition. It was
deemed offensive because the
Russians depicted Poles, Lith-
uanians and others in Soviet-
controlled territory as Soviet
citizens. Poles and others pro-
tested this label since they
were occupied against their
will by the Soviets at the start
of World War II.
The new exhibition - titled
"Tragedy. Courage. Libera-
tion" and prepared by the
Museum of the Great Patriotic

War in Moscow - removes
the controversial terminology.
It took years of discussions
between Polish and Russian
experts to finally complete it.
The exhibition narrates
* the Nazi crimes committed
against Soviet POWS at Aus-
chwitz, where they were the
fourth largest group of pris-
oners, and at other sites. And
it shows how the Red Army
liberated the camp on Jan. 27,
1945, and helped the inmates
afterward.
Also Sunday, a ceremony
was held in Moscow at the
Jewish Museum and Toler-
ance Center, which opened in
November and is Russia's first
major attempt to tell the story
of its Jewish community. The
museum portrays Russia as a
safe and welcoming place for
Jews today despite its history
of pogroms and discrimina-

Women in combat is progressive, but precautions needed
The United States military has once again taken a progres-
sive step in the continuing conversation on inclusion of
more Americans in the armed forces. On Jan. 24, out-going
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and General Martin Dempsey,
chairmgn of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, signed an order to lift the
military's 1994 ban on women in combat. The decision to include
women on the front line comes a year after the repeal of the Penta-
gon's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. Though the action to be more
inclusive and accommodating of female soldiers is honorable, cer-
tain precautions need to be made in order to ensure the well-being
of all military personnel.

The Republican Party has
spent the past few months
licking its wounds and
taking a long, hard look at the
man in the mirror. For the second
straight presi-
dential elec-
tion, the GOP
was trounced
- largely due
to its uncanny
ability to solely
appeal to old,
white men. The JAMES
Republican BRENNAN
Party has dug
its own grave
by taking a far-right stance on
religion, women's health, the envi-
ronment, the military, gay rights
and a myriad of other key issues.
While this may have gotten Presi-
dent George W. Bush to the White
House twice, it's clear that the
country's electorate has changed.
From what I can tell, Republi-
cans of my generation feel little to
no compassion for the policies of
the Bush era. Despite this change,
the GOP platform continues to
deny science, belittle women,
ignore minorities and denigrate
gay rights. This year's election is
proof that the socially conservative
Republican is a dying breed.
Younger Republicans, as
detailed in an article in The New
York Times, are predominantly
less conservative when it comes
to abortion, gay rights and other
social issues. As a whole, the Unit-
ed States supports gay marriage
- a fact expressed in poll numbers
and recent state ballot initiatives.
Moreover, the younger generation
has embraced access to contracep-
tion, the end of the war on drugs
and less military involvement over-
seas. Finally, what's most indica-
tive of the changing guard of the
Republican Party is the country's
changing views on religion. 16 to
20 percent of Americans are affili-
ated with no religion at all, a num-
ber that increases to 25 percent in

young people. The religious right
was integral in the elections of
Presidents Ronald Reagan, George
H. W. Bush and George W. Bush,
but Christianity is losing political
sway in young people.
What all this means is that the
current structure of the Repub-
lican Party - one dominated by
far-right social conservatives - is
inherently flawed. Economic issues
still draw sharp divides, but the
country is slowly uniting around
civil libertarianism. Young con-
servatives do not see former GOP
hopefuls Mitt Romney or Rick
Santorum as ideal candidates com-
pared with someone in the mold of
Ron Paul, one of the nation's most
influential libertarians.
There is a growing demand in
this country for politicians who
want to limit the government's
social and fiscal sway - for people
*who believe in both civil liber-
ties and deregulated free market
capitalism. College libertarian
clubs have sprouted up all over the
country, while college Republi-
cans are increasingly more open to
social freedom. This past year, Mitt
Romney did not win the major-
ity of women's votes and almost
completely failed to attract young
people and minority voters. Presi-
dent Barack Obama did an excel-
lent job rallying his supporters,
but the GOP has failed to embrace
the changing political ideologies of
America.
What the Republican Party
needs to realize is that social prog-
ress has come, apd it stops for no
one. Gay marriage is here to stay.
So is reform of the war on drugs,
women's access to birth control
and further secularization of gov-
ernment. The party will die if it
does not accept these changes,just
as Democrats would have died had
they tried to battle against civil
rights for years after the 1960s.
The Republican Party has
reached a reckoning point. Many
conservatives are angry that Mitt

Romney wasn't genuinely far-right
enough. Had he been a real conser-
vative, they claim, people would
have embraced his message and
voted Obama out of office.
The socially
conservative
republican is a
dying breed.

But as I said, this type of repub-
lican is a dying breed. Poll numbers
show that hardcore conservatism is
a major detriment to candidates in
the new demographics of America.
Obama won the youth, Latino and
female votes 60 percent, 71 per-
cent, and 53 percent, respectively.
Holding archaic stances on immi-
gration, race, sex, war and religion
is killing Republicans, as the num-
bers show.
Libertarianism, whether
through the Republican Party or
some other channel, will one day
soon come to have major political
power in this country. The GOP
can either choose to embrace a
long-term strategy for the future,
as the Democrats did, or they can
continue to be upended time and
again in national elections. Many
pundits and writers have embraced
the idea that Republicans just need
to reach out to minorities a little
more if they want to bounce back,
but that alone isn't enough. The far
right's view on the role of govern-
ment is dying. An embrace of lib-
ertarianism would shrink the gaps
in key demographics, while finally
giving libertarians - a large,
underrepresented political group -
somewhere to go. If the GOP plans
on surviving, they have to accept
the changing face of conservatism
or see their brand go extinct.

For years, women have been serving in
combat without acknowledgment. Due to the
blurring of front lines during recent wars and
the shortage of troops, female members of the
military often participate in combat without
the title or credit men receive. The decision to
repeal the ban - though delayed - will finally
give women the recognition they deserve.
Women will have a better chance at career
advancement in the military with approxi-
mately 237,000 combat-related positions now
open to female applicants. Better financial
compensation and benefits will also be avail-
able to women in combat.
Before women are allowed on the battle-
field, the military must first make some cul-
tural changes. For decades, reports of rape
and sexual assault by military personnel have
plagued the United States' armed forces. The
documentary, "The Invisible War," chronicles
the abuse of women in the military over many
years. Many assaults are reported to authori-
ties but only 16 offenders have been convicted
from 2001 to 2011.
Often times war zones are in areas in which

women are not on equal grounds as men. The
fear that women may be specifically targeted
by enemies on the front line deterred the
armed forces from allowing females in com-
bat. However, women in the military may face
more risks from other U.S. service people.
Women on the front line are often an added
bonus to their unit. Civilians are often more
likely to cooperate with a female soldier than a
male.Women are also able to conduct searches
on female citizens in areas where it is cultural-
ly unacceptable for men to touch women who
aren't their wives.
According to Panetta and Dempsey, the
standards for combat soldiers won't change,
but women will now have the opportunity
to apply. "Not everyone is going to be able to
be a combat soldier but everyone is entitled a
chance," Panetta said at the order signing. The
Pentagon's repeal of the ban works to share the
burden of national defense and allow ability,
not gender, to dictate roles. Now, the military's
next step is to make proactive changes within
their infrastructure to ensure the physical and
mental well-being of each soldier.

I urge the student body and University
administration to consider, discuss and reflect
on the social, political and psychological
implications of participation in and promotion
of a blood drive that prohibits donations from
gay and bisexual men.
Across the United States, businesses, non-
profit organizations, churches, universities
and hospitals regularly hold blood drives to
meet the persistent need for blood for trans-
fusions. According to a recent e-mail sent to
all University students, staff and faculty from
Vice President for Student Affairs, E. Royster
Harper, the donation of blood is a humanitar-
ian act, a civic duty, a way to show your school
pride and the gift of life itself. The Ameri-
can Red Cross, which collects 40 percent of
donated blood in the United States, encour-
ages organizations to hold blood drive events
in order to increase goodwill in communities,
provide an avenue for individual altruism and
save lives. After natural disasters, when cop-
ing with the death or illness of a loved one, or
simply looking for a way to "give back," people
are encouraged by their friends, families and
institutions to donate blood.
Maybe you've given blood, volunteered at
a blood;drive, even spearheaded an event like
the Blood Battle against Ohio State University.
Good. You understand the personal signifi-
cance of participation and you've likely saved
lives. Take a second to consider the following:
Imagine that you are banned from donating
blood startingnow and for the rest of your life.
Your vital blood and your civic contribution
are unwanted and rejected. You are excluded.
You are banned. You are unworthy to donate.
The ban on your blood has nothing to do
with any blood-borne illnesses (you aren't liv-
ing with any) or because of sexual behavior
that puts you at particular risk for a blood-
borne illness (at University-sponsored blood
drives and at blood drives around the coun-
try, a man is barred from donating blood if he
has had any form of protected sexual contact

with another man even once). You are banned
because you are a man who once had a boy-
friend or who comes home every night to a
husband instead of a wife. How does this feel?
Do you feel useless? Unwanted? Hated?
This feeling is the unexamined stigma rei-
fied by the quiet complicity of institutions
like the University and schools across cam-
pus, including the School of Social Work. If
we remain silent about the downsides inher-
ent in holding blood drives and if we refuse to
incorporate discussions about advocacy and
awareness into our promotion of and partici-'
pation in blood drives, then we will continue
contributing to the oppression of gay and
bisexual men.
At the University, we frequently approach
social justice issues from all-or-nothing
perspectives. Things are good or bad - and
right or wrong. There are rarely, if ever, open
conversations about the nuances and para-
doxes inherent in many of the activities. The
current and ongoing University-wide blood
drive, held in classrooms and common areas
all over campus, represents this aversion to
dialogue and self-reflection. Conversations
are limited to the idea that blood drives are
inherently and unassailably good. No ques-
tions, comments or concerns are welcome. No
criticisms or analyses allowed; no education
necessary.
Most things in life are rarely perfect. That
doesn't mean we can't work to make them bet-
ter. We don't have to ignore the stigmatizing
and marginalizing effects of blood drives. We
can promote the incredible benefits of blood
drives without relying on shaming those who
do not or cannot participate in them. We
should hold these events while holding trans-
parent conversations about our complicity in
structural oppression and ways we can work
to oppose it. It's time for us to reflect.

D escribe yourself in
three sentences that
are no more than
eight words each."
Excuse me,
internship appli-
cation: Did you
just give me all
of 24 words to
paint a picture
of the awesome-
ness that is
me? A personal
statement is one HEMA
thing, but being KARUNA-
forced to cut KARAM
down so much
into so little is
obnoxious. How doI pick just the
right words to use? I could just list
24 adjectives about myself - but
that's too boring. I could twist the
rules of grammar and write three
sentences that are not really sen-
tences - butI don't think I should
be experimenting too much on an
application like this. So, where doI
draw the line?
Dilemmas like mine aren't iso-
lated. It seems that the desire for
brevity as a way to measure think-
ing abilities is becoming more wide-
spread. And why not accomplish
two things at once by asking for a
sort of personal statement? A friend
recently shared a question from
a leading company that asked the
applicant to describe, in 100 words
or fewer, why he or she wanted to
work there. While the company
gets the desired information about
the applicant's interest from this,
it's also able to see how creative
the applicant can be in such space
limits.
But this forced conciseness seems
a bit counterintuitive to our edu-
cational methods. So much of our
time in school is spent describing,
expanding and developing ideas in
order to meet word or page require-

ments. We'll flip between online
thesauruses trying to find the
longestword that means what we
intend and add all kinds of "fluff"
to take up space. Even as I type this
column, my eyes are glancing down
to the word count every few min-
utes. While we've been taught not
to ramble and to stick to the point,
we're still encouraged to explain
our ideas as much as possible. And
now, suddenly, it seems that what-
ever we learned from our 25-page
final reports and 5,000-word liter-
ary analyses has gone to waste.
Perhaps this argument that less
is more is about more than just
measuring our creative ability. In
our fast-paced world, people don't
have time to read through anything
longer than a few sentences at a
time. Take the Twitter culture, for
example. With over 200-million
monthly active users, the San Fran-
cisco-based company is one of the
largest online forums - despite the
fact that its users are only allowed
to post 140 characters at a time.
Personally, I feel stifled every
time I'm tweeting and see that
little red counter closing in toward
'zero. I'm that person struggling
to eliminate characters until I can
make it down to exactly 140; some-
times, I'm forced to spread my ideas
across multiple tweets at once. On
principle I refuse to abbreviate
"you" to "u" and "before" to "b4"
- I won't budge when it comes to
good English. But being the word
nerd that I am, it's suffocating to
have to replace a longer, more apt
word with one that is shorter and
more succinct. (And can we take a
moment to acknowledge that "suc-
cinct," at eight letters, is hardly a
succinct word?)
Giving in to the demands of
modern culture shouldn't have to
mean compromising vocabulary.
But maybe, even from a language-

oriented point of view, being short
on space means finding innovative
uses for punctuation or communi-
cating multiple entendres where
appropriate. It's an exercise not just
in creativity, but, perhaps, also in
mastery of language.
When we're
cramped for space,
every letter means
so much more.
Maybe you've yet to face a task
that requires you to drastically cut
down on words. But if and when
you do come across such a situ-
ation, embrace it as a challenge.
Finding the right words to describe
who we are or what we feel is never
easy, but when we have to do so in
such a small space it turns into an
opportunity to truly find the root
of what we're tryingto say. For all
the Twitter fiends out there, think
about what's really important in
every tweet you compose. When
we're cramped for space, every let-
ter means so much more.
As for me, I've tried to turn what
was initially an annoyance into
an exercise in figuring out what
I'm really about. There's some-
thing almost poetic about trying
to describe ourselves with just
the bare minimum. So, here Iam,
stripped down to the root.

seeing more influenza illness,"
Winfield said. "I know several
staff have been out with influ-
enzaeven though they were vac-
cinated."
UHS has also set up hygienic
stations throughout the clinic.
"As we do every year, we have
posts with a hand cleanser dis-
penser and a stack of masks
throughout UHS," Winfield said.
"If we have someone coughing in
the sitting room, we'll ask them to
put on a mask."
In addition to the antibacterial
dispensers, Winfield said some
nurses have been diverted from
their normal duties to vaccinate
students.
Due to UHS's new appoint-
ment-only system, Winfield said
his staff have been able to triage
patients in order to differenti-
ate those with flu-like symptoms
from those that actually have the
flu.
"We're trying to handle a lot of
the influenza-like illness on the
phone, unless someone is very ill
and needs to be seen," Winfield
said. "So we really don't know at
this point if we had the old walk-
in system whether we would be
mobbed."
UHS has adapted to the early
outbreak of this season's influen-
za illness, but UMHS has been hit
the hardest, Winfield said.
"I know that U of M Emer-
gency Department has seen an
increase in the number of influen-
za-like illness in adults and chil-
dren above what is normally seen
at this time of year."

Molnar said it's important that
the group is comfortable with
each other. Anything said at the
meetings does not leave the room.
"The idea is to get the atmo-
sphere comfortable because every-
one isvery exposed at the moment."
With less-somber topics, it's
common to keep the environment
light - cue decorative condoms.
Last semester, the group made pins
out of condoms decorated with
magazine pictures for backpack
decoration.
"There are manyinnuendosthat
come up," Molnar said of discus-
sionsingeneral."It'safunnytopic."
LSA freshman Katherine Irani
joined the forum this semes-
ter, but is looking forward to the
learning opportunity.
"I'm interested in sexual-
ity as a whole and am think-
ing about studying it so I kind
of wanted to learn as much as I
can through as many resources
as possible."
Molnar said a discussion-based
sexual-health student group is
rare on campus, describing other
sexual health groups as "more
pedantic."
"It's a safe place to learn and ask
about sexuality that you normally
wouldn't be able to," Molnar said.
"(Members) gain a sort of security

within themselves in the fact that
they know about sex more. I've
learned things that I've always
wondered about that had Inot been
given that opportunity to learn
* those things that I would still be
confused about."

reproductive health. She hopes
the event would help enlighten
more people on the abortion
laws throughout the country.
"We have so many young peo-
ple and so much support for the
pro-life cause," Criswell said.
"It's just a great way to show
what we're all about and what
we're working towards, which is
ending abortion."
On Saturday, Criswell and
other members of the club
attended the Students for Life of
America conference, the largest
student anti-abortion confer-
ence in the world. Criswell said
over 2,000 students attended
the conference, which aimed to
unify the "pro-life generation"
and to work toward abolishing
abortion.
The University's delegation
was named the 2013 Group of
the Year by Students for Life of
America for the work they did
with the Pregnant on Campus
initiative. As part of the initia-

tive, they created an e-mail
address, pregnantinfo@umich.
edu, where pregnant women
on campus can confidentially
receive free resources as well as
other support. The services pro-
vided include free ultrasounds,
adoption referrals, help with stu-
dent housing arrangements and
financial aid.
Through the Pregnant on Cam-
pus initiative and other efforts,
Students for Life continues to
advocate for anti-abortion causes.
"Even though the life issue
didn't win in this (past) election,
we're still pushing forward,"
Criswell said.
Criswell said the significance
of the 40th anniversary of the
Roe v. Wade decision has ener-
gized the anti-abortion base to
continue to ramp up its advo-
cacy in the future. She pointed
out that many people at the
rally have never known a time
before abortion was legal.
"We can't rely on politicians,
we have to do it ourselves,"
Criswell said about revisit-
ing the debate about abortion.
"Forty years is way too long."

FIRE
From Page 1A
Two Huron Valley ambulanc-
es were also on scene, and Ann
Arbor police vehicles blocked
off Division Street at Jefferson,
and also blocked Williams Street
between Thompson and Division
streets. The house is on the same
block as the University's Insti-
tute for Social Research.
Menard said on scene the
department believes the fire was
started when frozen pipes were
being thawed by a torch.
There were no reported inju-
ries, but AAFD personnel did
rescue two dogs from the house.
Menard said the dogs were fine
and reunited with their owners.
Firefighters brought two
ladder trucks and set up two
additional ladders to reach the
second floor of the house. Fire-
fighters with flashlights were
seen breaking windows - from
inside the house.
There appeared to be little
exterior damage to the building,
and neighboring houses were not

evacuated.
Firefighters deemed the house
uninhabitable Friday night. A
Red Cross vehicle was on scene
later Friday evening to assist and
provide shelter to victims of tie
fire. University Housing officials
were also reportedly on scene to
place affected students in tempo-
rary housing.
Both streets were reopened
to traffic at about 8:45 p.m. as
cleanup and utility crews arrived
on scene.
According to city of Ann Arbor
records, the building permit
granted to property manager Old
Town Realty expired in June of
2011.
Additionally, a 2010 city
inspection cited the building's
landlords for failing to replace
broken smoke alarms in two
of the units. Old Town Realty
manages 25 properties and has
been in operation since 1972.
Company representatives were
unavailable for comment over
the weekend.
Although managed by Old
Town Realty, the property
is owned by Ouimet LLC, an

enterprise registered to for-
mer state representative Mark
Ouimet. Ouimet said he is
unsure when residents will
be able to come back to their
homes.
"As of yet, we do not know a
move-in date," Oimet said. "It's
been boarded up to secure every-
thing in the meantime."
Oimet said he does not yet
know the extent of the damages.
He said the insurance company
will arrive on the scene Monday
to assess the house.
AnnArbor.con reporter Ryan
Stanton lives in the house and his
dog, Stan, was one of those saved
by the firefighters.
"Well, my house might have
caught fire. today, but at least
the firefighters saved Stan," he
tweeted.
Friday night's fire was the
second major fire to catch in an
off-campus apartment complex
in the past month. On Jan. 14,
flames tore through a Packard St.
apartment complex, sending six
residents to the University Hos-
pital and leaving units uninhab-
itable until further notice.


PARIKH
From Page 1A
campaign promises.
' Parikh broke the mold for
CSG when he and LSA junior
Omar Hashwi ran and won as
independents for the presi-
dency and vice presidency. One
of their main promises was to
reach out and turn their former
opponents' platforms into CSG
policy.
Public Policy senior Kevin
Mersol-Barg, who was the presi-
dential nominee of OurMichigan
and is founder of the Coalition for
Tuition Equality, said Parikh has
been supportive of CTE - which
advocates in-state tuition rates
for Michigan's undocumented
residents. Specifically, Mersol-
Barg noted that Parikh has
spoken at meetings of the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents to support
tuition equality.
"I didn't really know what
to expect - certainly when he
campaigned he said that he
would embrace the many cam-
paign goals of his competitors,"
Mersol-Barg said. "I think for
the most part he's made a good
faith effort to reach out with me
at least and see how we can work
together."
No longer a competitor, Mer-
sol-Barg said he's pleased to see
Parikh visibly in favor CTE's
goals.
LSA senior Aditya Sathi, the
presidential candidate from
MForward, said Parikh has
been involved in two issues that
he ran on - medical amnesty
and the Student Association of
Michigan.
Medical amnesty - a pol-
icy of not issuing citations to
minors seeking medical atten-
tion for alcohol-related con-
ditions in many cases - was
signed into law over the sum-
mer, so there was little Parikh
could do for the issue, Sathi
noted. He said, however, that
he was pleased to see Parikh
support a resolution in the fall
to include the medical amnesty
policy in the University's state-
ment of rights. He'll be meeting
with Parikh in the near future
to continue discussion on the
subject.
Sathi, who is also the trea-
surer of SAM, said Parikh has
been supportive of the state-

wide coalition of public uni-
versities - pointing out that
he has sent representatives
to SAM meetings, which past
presidents have not always
been done.
Another campaign promise,
Parikh and Hashwi created The
International Student Affairs
Commission, an organization for
issues affecting international stu-
dents.
Parikh, a dual citizen of the
United States and India, also said
that promoting entrepreneurship
would be a main goal - evidenced
by the new Entrepreneurship
Commission. .
According to the proposed
winter 2013 semester bud-
get, the International Student
Affairs Commission and Entre-
preneurship Commission will
be allocated $8,100 and $6,670,
respectively, for the winter 2013
semester - makingthem the two
most well-funded CSG commis-
sions.
"Every single entrepreneur-
ship organization on campus is
represented on the (entrepre-
neurship) commission," Parikh
said, adding that this March will
be a campus-wide entrepreneur-
ship month with about 15 entre-
preneurship related events to be
held then.
As candidates, Parikh and
Hashwi also promised to bring
more prominent musical acts to
Ann Arbor.
CSG Treasurer Chris Osborn
said the proposed winter 2013
CSG budget allocates $10,000 to
Music Matters - a group dedi-
cated to putting on large concerts
at the University - making CSG
its largest contributor. It did not
receive CSG fundinglastyear.
Furthermore, this semester
marks the inception of a 24-hour
cafe at the Undergraduate Library,
another promise of the duo. Bert's
Cafe is now open 24 hours on Sun-
days through Wednesdays.
While it was not a campaign
promise, a major project under-
taken by Parikh's administration
has been the CSG interns pro-
gram where students work with
CSG members in teams on dif-
ferent projects like the Take U-M
Abroad program.
"Most of these (interns), I'd
say, are way smarter than I am or
other people inCSGare rightnow,
and if we empower them to effect
change when they're freshman

right now, the change that they
will unleash on this University
two years, three years, four years
down the road will be absolutely
historic," Parikh said.
Lastly, Parikh has made good
on another promise - albeit an
aesthetic one. He has largely
refrained from wearing formal
wear while conducting CSG busi-
ness, fulfilling his promise to not
wear a suit or tie, which he said
was to achieve a better connec-
tion with students.
PROMISES PENDING
Parikh and Hashwi promised
that professors would have to
make syllabi for classes publicly
available during enrollment. He
said in a recent interview that
this will "definitely happen."
The University did not immedi-
ately respond to comment on the
topic.
Parikh said CSG has been
advocating more equitable spend-
ing by the University - another
campaign promise - and pointed
to the Peace and Justice Commis-
sion and its action against Adidas
last semester as results of that
campaign. Parikh acknowledged
that his administration was not
directly responsible for this activ-
ity - the commission has been
fighting Adidas since before he
was president.
Lastly, Parikh and Hashwi
also promised that students
would be able to choose their
own commencement speak-
er. While Parikh said he has
spoken with administrators
regarding this idea, he said he
didn't expect to begin work-
ing on it until this semester
because commencement is not
until May.
GRADUATE STUDENT
SECESSION LOOMS
While workingtokeephis cam-
paign promises, Parikh has also
been dealing with other events
that have come up in his term -
most notably, possible graduate
student secession from CSG.
Despite having charges
brought against it in the Cen-
tral Student Judiciary twice, the
Rackham Student Government's
November elections - dur-
ing which 69 percent of the 9.5
percent of voting Rackham stu-
dents voted in favor of secession

- were upheld. Furthermore,
64 percent of the 48 percent of
Law School students who voted
on the issue supported secession
as well.
Watson, who does not sup-
port graduate secession, said
the responsibility of prevent-
ing graduate student seces-
sion will fall solely on Parikh's
shoulders.
"I think that the student body
president serving at that time
owes it to the organization and its
legacy and its historical signifi-
cance and also to the student body
to make sure (secession) doesn't
happen," Watson said. "Because
there's nothing good that can
come of (secession). It will only
divide the student voice."
Watson said the greatest
power of the CSG presidency is
the ability to represent the stu-
dents to the University adminis-
tration.
"I think everybody who has
an opportunity to sit in that seat
understands that there isn't really
muchthatcanbedonewithoutthe
support and the follow-through
of the University administration,"
Watson said. "Being able to sit in
a room with them and discuss the
issues with students concerns'
and serve in an official capacity
as (students') representative is an
extremely powerful and benefi-
cial tool to have."
Parikh also stressed the need
for a single representative for the
entire studentbody.
RSG President Michael Ben-
son, said that while he and his
administration support seces-
sion, it's not because Parikh is
doing an inordinately bad job. He
said he and Parikh even had a sit-
down meeting at the beginning
of the school year, an uncommon
occurrence for RSG and CSG
leaders.
"As far as reaching out to grad
students, I'd say he's doing about

the same as the last few (CSG
presidents)," Benson said.
Benson said he doesn't know
if Parikh has reached out to the
professional student community,
but he said he heard that Parikh
had been in contact with the
Graduate Employees' Organiza-
tion.
Benson did question, none-
theless, whether Parikh's action
have only been in response to the
secession movement.
"It's certainly on his radar, and
that is a step forward," Benson
said.
This is the third major push for
graduate student secession in the
last 50 years. The previous two
attempts failed, but the possibil-
ity of losing about two-fifths of its
constituents is an issue for CSG
and Parikh was clear in his dis-
sent with secession.
"I firmly do believe 100 percent
that being united is the best for
the entire student body," he said.
Nonetheless, Parikh said the
only action he would be tak-
ing against secession would be
reaching out to students, admin-
istrators and the regents about
the historical and future impor-
tance of maintaining the current
structure of student govern-
ment.
"At the end of the day, I'm not
going to impose my will in any
sense,"he said.
Parikl didn't say whether
secession would occur during
his time as president, but only
stressed the importance that CSG
remain intact.
"I sincerely do hope that Cen-
tral Student Government will
for today and for 10 years down
the road and for 100 years down
the road will continue to repre-
sent 42,000 Wolverines on cam-
pus and we'll make every effort
to make sure that it does remain
unified."

TOKYO (AP) - The joint U.S.
and Japanese investigation into
the Boeing 787's battery prob-
lems has shifted from the bat-
tery-maker to the manufacturer
of a monitoring system.
Japan transport ministry offi-
cial Shigeru Takano said Monday
the probe into battery-maker GS
Yuasa was over for now as no
evidence was found it was the
source of the problems.
Ministry officials said they
will inspect Kanto Aircraft

part of the ongoing investigation.
It makes a system that monitors

ture of the lithium-ion batteries.

January, a battery in a Japan
Airlines 787 caught fire while
parked at Boston's Logan Inter-
national Airport.
GS Yuasa shares jumped on
the news it is no longer being
investigated, gaining nearly 5
percent in Tokyo trading. The
issue had plunged 12 percent
after the battery problems sur-
faced in Japan.
Ministry officials stopped
short of saying that Kanto's mon-
itoring system was under any
special scrutiny, saying it was
part of an ongoing investigation.
"We are looking into affiliated

are looking into possibilities."

It is the first jet to make wide
use of lithium-ion batteries, the
kind usually found in laptops and
other gadgets. They are prone to
overheating and require addi-
tional systems to avoid fires.
Investigators have been look-
ing at the remnants of the ANA
flight's charred battery, but it is
unclear whether the battery or a
related part was behind its over-
heating. Investigators have said
the ANA battery and the JAL
battery did not receive excess
voltage.
Japanese carrier All Nippon
Airways was the "launch cus-
tomer" for the 787, and has been
forced to cancel services - 643

Japan Airlines, which has
fewer 787s than ANA, has
deployed other aircraft in its
fleet, minimizing its flight can-
cellations.
Boeing, which competes
against Airbus of France, has
halted 787 deliveries. Boeing has
orders for more than 800 of the
Dreamliner planes.
The 787 is the first airliner
made mostly from lightweight
composite materials that boost
fuel efficiency. It also relies on
electronic systems rather than
hydraulic or mechanical sys-
tems to a greater degree than any
other airliner.
Analysts say customers won't
come back to the 787 unless its
safety is solidly assured.

Tina Fey's farewell

End of '30 Rock'
opens throne for
new comedy queen
By EMILY BODDEN
For the Daily
Will the ending of beloved "30
Rock" on Jan. 31 bring the chance
for a female comedy writer to take
over the reigns from Tina Fey? For
me, Tina Fey is the face of women
in comedy. While I will be sad to
see her show end (I've been an
avid fan for years), Iam excited to
see if anyone will accept the chal-
lenge of taking her spot.
Amy Poehler would be an obvi-
ous fit. Tina and Amy have been
friends since their days at the
comedy company Second City,
and often guestwrite and co-star
in each other's work. As epito-
mized by their performance at
this year's Emmys, they are both
hilarious and work well together.
And though I love Amy, I think
she is already established. Seen in
the recent episode of "Parks And
Recreation," "Two Parties," Amy
is not going anywhere. Her writ-
ing staff is on its A-game and con-
tinually produces inspiring work.
She can't fill Fey's niche because
she isbusy actively filling her own
role in the world of comedy and
maintaining alarge fanbase.
The possible hopefuls that
I am looking at are the newer
generation of funny ladies: Lena
Dunham (HBO's "Girls"), Mindy
Kaling (Fox's "The Mindy Proj-
ect") and Zooey Deschanel (Fox's
"New Girl").
Lena Dunham is unapologet-
ic and awesome. If you've ever
watched an episode of "Girls," it
is more than likely that you have
been one of the hundreds of thou-
sands privy to her naked body. Her
humor is brash and sometimes a
little lost on viewers. That being
said, she rewards her watchers by
building a relationship with the
characters that makes each epi-
sode's jokes hit harder.
Unlike Tina's witty banter and
funny one-liners, Lena creates
humor through situations and
editing. One memorable example

I

"It's shiny, but can I just get a sandwich instead?"

Arn't you an Oscar-nominated actor?
'Hansel & Gretel'hacks
its way to mediocrity

of Lena's humor is in the "Girls"
episode "Welcome to Bush-
wick a.k.a. The Crackcident." In
this episode, we find the tightly
wound and naive Shoshanna acci-
dently smoking crack at a party
in Bushwick and exclaiming, "Oh
my god, don't tell my mom! Don't
even tell me!" Shoshanna running
around pantsless epitomizes Lena
Dunham's talented writing.
I want to like Mindy Kaling's
"The Mindy Project" so badly.
Every week, I watch in hopes that
all of the jokes will land. Mindy
can be so funny, but her show
doesn't always demonstrate that.
There are weeks where "The
Mindy Project" is laugh-out-loud
funny, but are then disappoint-
ingly followed by an episode so
flat that I must force myself to
watch it in entirety. The episodes
that are great keep me hopeful for
her show.
Also, if you're in need of a new
Twitter account to follow, I'd rec-
ommend Mindy's. Her tweets are
sharp and worthy of a retweet.
Plus, she has a great friendship
with BJ Novak, a comedian and
one of the writers of "The Office,"
which results in hilarious Twitter
conversations. I'm optimistic that
her relationships with the other
comedy bigwigs will ultimately
aid in ssving her show.
There are rumors that "The
Mindy Project" will be lucky
enough to receive some of "30
Rock" 's talented writers. Hav-

ing a skilled writing staff to back
up her jokes and ideas can only
strengthen the show's content.
Zooey Deschanel is the most
universally likeable of the three.
Like Tina, Zooey appeals to a
large audience. She is cute and
inoffensive in her efforts. Some-
times, she is arguably too cute.
"New Girl" has the ability to be
more of a mainstream show than
"Girls" and "The Mindy Project."
The show never gets controversial
and relies on the actors to carry
the generally well-written lines.
Unlike boundary pushers
Mindy and Lena, Zooey may
align more closely to Amy than
Tina. Like Amy Poehler, Zooey
Deschanel doesn't actively write
the episodes of her show. She's
funny in character and appealing
in interviews, but isn't as involved
in the creation of a funny series
like Mindy and Lena are. Is this a
problem for me? Not particularly,
but I would like to see Zooey try
her hand at writing some of the
episodes. To be agrue face of com-
edy, one must have the talent to
create written humor in addition
to having an entertaining camera
presence.
While I will mourn the end
of "30 Rock," I am looking for-
ward to the next generation of
female comedians. There is a lot
of potential that needs to be fur-
ther explored, granting 2013 the
makings of a good year for funny
women.

The many
problems with
Project'

'Movie 43' makes a mess

H ere's the thing,"
my housemate
Harrison said
nervously, perched on our living-
room sofa. "I don't actually like
'The Mindy
Project."'
To his sur-
prise, I was
relieved.
We
bonded over
our secret
distaste for KAYLA
the Mindy UPADHYAYA
Kaling-
created sit-
com. Harrison had been scared
to confess, certain that I - like
all our other housemates - was
loving it.
Because what's not to love?
One of my fave comedy hero-
ines finally has her own show,
on which she plays a not-white,
not-stick-thin OB/GYN. Plus, it
stars Ike Barinholtz, a Chicago-
improv vet, and Chris Messina,
who became one of my favorite
TV actors with his multi-season
performance on "Damages." In
other words, when I first heard
of "The Mindy Project" 's devel-
opment, I immediately broke into
a chorus of "These Are a Few of
My Favorite Things."
After the underwhelming
pilot aired, I adamantly defended
the show. The first several epi-
sodes of a sitcom are often the
throwaway batch of too-brown
pancakes. Even some of the best
comedies out there take a while
to find their voice - "Parks and
Recreation" didn't hit its stride
until season two, and "New Girl"
had one of the most dramatic
turnarounds I've ever seen.
And yet, here we are, i2 epi-
sodes into "Mindy" 'a first sea-
son, and I'm struggling to come
up with anything the show does
particularly well, and I'm done
defending it.
A lot of the dysfunction comes
down to the shaky character
dynamics - all of the friendships
seem forced, especially Mindy's
pointless best friend Gwen,
played by Anna Camp, who's
given little more to do than rock
Lands End clothing and talk on
the phone (Camp, thankfully, has
asked to be reduced from regular
to recurring and will hopefully
take her talents someplace where
they're more appreciated).
But it's the relationship
between Mindy (Kaling) and
Danny (Messina), the show's
archetypal will-they-won't-they
pairing, that troubles me the
most. The friendship between
these constantly clashing
coworkers soars past tension-
ridden into downright nasty ter-
ritory. In the pilot, a one-upping
insult session ends with Danny
telling Mindy she should lose
15 pounds. His words just hang
there, and neither the show nor
the characters ever deal with
what has just happened.
"Mindy" doesn't seem at all
concerned with repercussions;
it touches on controversial and
complex topics, only to bar-
rel right past them. Danny and
Jeremy (Ed Weeks) unilaterally
shut Mindy out of the decision-
making process when the three
take over the practice, but the
show is too stuck in its own myo-
pia to touch on workplace gender
dynamics. In fact, all that really
amounts from this is further

establishing Danny as a disre-
spectful jerk. But then the show
turns right around and tries to
make him a lovable, heartbro-
ken jerk. He can't call Mindy fat
one second and then build her a
beautiful gingerbread house the
next... it just doesn't click.
Beyond the stellar cast and
stacked writers room, what had
me most excited about "Mindy"
at the outset was its focus on
women's healthcare providers.
While there's no dearth of medi-
cal programming, TV has been
noticeably silent about the world
of obstetrics and gynecology.
But "Mindy" isn't really break-
ing that silence; patient-doctor
interactions have been minimal,
and the show has yet to engage in
any kind of discourse or even sat-
ire about the highly politicized

world of healthcare. As a sitcom,
it doesn't need to be an all-out
soapbox for political discourse,
but "30 Rock" and "Parks and
Recreation" have proven it's pos-
sible - and quite effective - to
tie national events and senti-
ments into their humor.
And the statements "Mindy"
does make are confusing, like
when Mindy - an intelligent,
supposedly progressive OB/GYN
- tries to stop her teenage neigh-
bor from having sex instead of
providing her with resources
for protection. In the end, she
distributes condoms to all the
girls in her gym class, but it's an
unconvincing change of heart for
someone who was just lecturing
a teen about waiting and refusing
to give her birth control.
In an episode that finds Mindy
asking Danny to be her gynecolo-
gist - again, a character choice
that makes zero damn sense -
Mindy explains how "condom
etiquette" is hard for women.
She implies there's a stigma
against women who have too
many condoms too readily avail-
able, but the characters again fail
to even come close to touching
on why that is or how society's
sexist double standards impact
women's sexual health.
I wouldn't quite say "Mindy"
is sex-negative, but that's
because its attitude toward sex
is so all-over-the-place that
I can't keep up. In the pilot,
Mindy decides that maybe real
relationships really are too dif-
ficult to balance at the moment,
instead opting for a more casual
arrangement with her coworker
in a scene awesomely scored by
M.I.A's "Bad Girls."
So naturally, the title for the
twelfth episode, "HookingUp is
Hard," puzzled me. Sure enough,
Mindy ends up forgetting every-
thing she once thought about
casual sex, as she awkwardly
attempts to hook up with her
midwife enemy Brendan (Mark
Duplass), only to be thwarted
by Morgan, who insists she's
too respectable of a woman to
be dragged into the depths of
hook-up-culture hell. Because
eventhough Mindy is a grown
woman, she needs a man to tell
her what's best for her.
This show is
as messy as its
lead's love life.
And it's for that very reason
that Mindy also just doesn't
quite click asa character.
Unlikeable sitcom leads can
work wonderfully (would you
ever actually want to work for
Michael Scott?), but her emo-
tional immaturity and delu-
sions (before hooking up with
Brendan, she records a video of
herself, outliningwho should
star in the Lifetime movie about
her should she be murdered)
push her so far away from the
empowering vision I initially
had of the character.
She's an awesome female doc-
tor who owns a practice, and yet
her goal in life is to marry rich
and quit her job or marry an old
guy and collect his inheritance
when he dies. She's a gynecolo-

gist who doesn't seem to have
much concern for women's
sexual health. And none of these
contradictions have any comedic
weight to them.
As an Indian-American
woman, I can't stress enough
how significant it is that Kaling
is the only Indian-American
lead on television and the first
Indian-American female lead
ever. It's a huge deal and earns
"Mindy" a spot in television his-
tory.
But that doesn't make it criti-
cism-proof, and it certainly isn't
enough to make me forget about
all the problems I'm having with
the show. So if "The Mindy Proj-
ect" doesn't figure its shit out
soon, can we just replace it with
a "Kelly Kapoor: Business Bitch"
spinoff?

Barely a silver
lining in this
cinematic disaster
By ANDREW MCCLURE
Daily Arts Writer
Seldom does a movie precede
itself with solely B-movie trail-
ers. Seldom does a movie leave
viewers with a
mute car ride D+
home, devoid of
any reflective Movie 43
discourse. Par-
allel with this At Quality16
trend, seldom and Rave
does a movie 'Relativity
equate itself to
"SuperBabies:
Baby Geniuses 2" in terms of cog-
nitive effort. Seldom should we -
or any other species - witness the
self-laughing, entirely unfunny
cinematic mistake that is "Movie
43." It doesn't even qualify for the
"Let's sneak into another flick for
free" list. Yikes.
Turns out, the framework
of "43" had more laugh-factory
potential than its constituent
parts. It's episodic: Picture an
egregious "SNL," full of 10-min-
ute bits, each more irrelevant
than the next. But it's not just any
"SNL"; it's one with multiple star
hosts. Except they're all having a
"tough crowd" sort of night. Den-
nis Quaid ("The Big Easy"), Greg
Kinnear ("Little Miss Sunshine"),
Common ("American Gangster"),
Emma Stone ("Zombieland"),
among other somewhat esteemed
Hollywood regulars, take a col-
lective shit on the chest of their
unlucky viewers - funny, because
shitting on one's chest captures
the miniature storyline of one
episode. And it was actually less

Next week on 'Catfish'...
pitiful than most of its surround-
ing players.
A plot synopsis attempt \would
be futile, but here's the gist: Hugh
Jackman ("Les Miserables")
has bulging balls hanging from
his neck like a pendulum swing,
Naomi Watts ("The Impossible")
plays a homeschooling mom who
insists on giving her son his first
kiss, Richard Gere ("Arbitrage")
innovates the iBabe (life-size nude
broad for randy adolescents), and
Jason Sudeikis ("Horrible Boss-
es") and Justin Long ("Drag Me to
Hell") speed-date as Batman and
Robin. "43" succeeds in interesting
ways, like alternately sucking then
taking a breather from sucking.
Liars will claim they never
laughed. Bigger liars will claim
they laughed more than 12 times.
And the biggest liars will claim
less than 75 percent of said laughs
stemmed from Jackman's tes-
ticular wattle. It was funny, but
the cheapest breed of funny, like

something found in "Dumb and
Dumber" or "Happy Gilmore,"
when cartoonish sound effects
and slapsticks to the face domi-
nate the screen.
Don't get me wrong; it's not
nearly as good as described above.
Absurdity in farce can really
work - just look at "Scary Movie"
and "Not Another Teen Movie" as
semi-recent examples. But farce
still requires something essential:
a scripted film to work with. Rath-
er, "43" is an overdosed marathon
of the arbitrary, from tits and
blood to uncoolvulgarity and livid
leprechauns. It just never feels
right, or funny or rightly funny.
Seldom do critics and genre
junkies share a wavelength.
With "43," unlike other justifi-
able bad films, it's actually both
hip and indie to hate this. Not
even audacious pundits exist for
"43" - you know, the guys who
fight tooth and nail to defend
genuinely bad movies. Why,

because people work in sec-
onds. And this shitshow wastes
approximately 5,400 of them.
Dumb going in, dumber coming
out. Like meth - without the
high.
The best question to ask is
a profound one: How do these
nightmares get green-lit? Who-
ever green-lights must wipe his
ass with green kryptonite.
A final scene, a highlight in
an attempt to a humor-void try,
stages Terrence Howard as he
inspires his high-school hoops
team in the locker room pre-
game. "You're black! They're
white! Dribble up the court with
that foot-and-a-half long dick!"
That's precisely what "43"
is: something that has all the
makings to satisfy a blue whale.
Unfortunately for the creators,
humans aren't blue whales, and
most prefer a. more modest cod-
piece. See Dr. 90210 and we'll
chat later. Or not.

TV NOT E B OK
Californication becomes stale

By MOLLY WEBER
Daily Arts Writer
I'm disappointed in Hank
Moody. Like all of the other
women on his show, I've grown
sick of the bullshit. And I didn't
even need to sleep with him to
find that out.
Season six of "Californication"
returned to the Sunday night
lineup two weeks ago, and to
even higher ratings than its for-
mer season. The show focuses on
the famous misanthropic writer
Hank Moody (star and executive
producer David Duchovny); when
he's not serving up charming,
irreverent quips in the wake of the
newest self-destructive decision,
Hank is having sex with every
beautiful extra or sexy guest star
the show can manage to snag
(Carla Gugino, Meagan Good and
Maggie Grace). And that's just
scrapingthe tip of the iceberg.
But the newest viewers to tune
in will witness Hank's character
slipping away. A character that
was defined by both his similarity
to the actor that played him and,
more importantly, their subtle dif-
ferences.
The problem with "Califor-
nication" isn't the proliferate of
sex, the incessant drug use, nor
the lack of meaningful relation-
ships. That's actually the best part
of "Californication" - it can suc-
cessfully promote lewd vice and
excess as both fun and hilarious
while maintaining a daring sense
of dignity.
"Californication"'s issue began
to manifest itself toward the end
of last season: Hank began to
seem less and less silly, and more
and more stupid. His clearly
insane ex-girlfriend from New
York, Carrie, tracks him down in
California at the close of the last
season. On the cusp of romanti-
cally reuniting with Karen, both
his on-and-off-girlfriend and baby
mama, Hank encounters Carrie
waiting for him in his home. What
turned into a quick stop becomes
a confrontation that Hank allows
to go too far. Though the object of
his pining pursuit for five seasons
is in his grasp, he stops to have a
drink with Carrie.
But Carrie has the drink
drugged; it is intended to kill both
Hank and herself. The success is
only with the latter.
So, season six opens with both
Hank waking up in the hospi-

tal room after the ordeal, along
with my own desperate hopes
that Hank would soon be getting
back to what he does best: loving
women, weed and writing while
seeking misadventure with his
ridiculous agent Harry Runkel
(Evan Handler). Finally, the char-
acter that men want to be and
women want to be with would
come out swinging.
How terribly wrong Iwas.
Hank goes on a month-long
bender that, well, is shockingly
boring. And since when is "Cali-
fornication" boring? If anyone
has seen the "Monkey Business"
episode of season four, they would
agree with me. But the man feels
guilty for Carrie's death, going
even further to say it's because he
broke her heart. While no one dis-
agrees that this is a sad aspect of
the plot, it's confusing and honest-
ly bizarre that his character is so
upset about it. It's forced, almost
unnatural. How many girls'
hearts have you broken, Hank?
Then, Hank accompanies a
Hank Moody is
the problem.
new female friend to her former
lover's funeral. The next thing
you know, the famous writer is
outside being sexually serviced
by the deceased's widow. Really?
Before, Hank was a 'yes man' -
but a'yes man' with taste. Now,
he just chases whatever he can
get, and it seems to be less and
less of the beautiful Karen. No
one is asking for the storyline
to tie up nicely with the couple
happily ever after. "Californica-
tion" is not a romance. And to be
honest, Karen may be the best
character because she's the only
worian that doesn't want to be
with Hank.
In other words, I think the
problem with "Californication"
is Hank Moody. As the lines
that separate actor and charac-
ter seem to slip away more and
more, I can't help but think that
the Hank Moody I wish new
viewers could see has instead
been replaced with the lazy
David Duchovny, simply play-
ing himself. u t
"Californication" used to be

"Welcome to the O.C., bitch."
the cool, hilarious comedy that
possessed subtle zeitgeist under-
currents of a Bret Easton Ellis
novel. Five seasons later, it seems
amateur. Hank Moody, David
Duchcsvny, the writers - they
cannot continue to expect that
continual use of the same ingredi-

ents will yield them a success.
Anyone can follow a recipe.
What makes a show special is the
ability to use those same ingre-
dients, mutter, Screw the recipe,
let's make it our own and serve up
something fresh. "Californica-
tion" has lost that special touch.

TV REVIEW
Intense 'The Following
lacks final destination

Kevin Bacon
sizzles in serial
killer thriller
By RADHIKA MENON
Daily Arts Writer
TV has never been afraid
of serial killers. Most notably,
Showtime's "Dexter" and CBS's
"Criminal
Minds" explore B
the inner work-
ings of these
flawed mur-
derers. Dex- Following
ter Morgan is Pilot
America's most
beloved serial Mondays at 9 p.m.
killer (if that FOX
sort of thing is
even possible),
and the cast of "Criminal Minds"
repeatedly walks us through a
day in the life of solving these
types of crimes. What's distinct
about these two shows is that
they openly take on the perspec-
tive of either the criminal or the
detective - never both - with
little room between the lines.
FOX's "The Following" takes
aim at this middle ground, per-
sonifying both ex-FBI Agent
Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon, "Mys-
tic River") and psychopathic seri-
al killer Dr. Joe Carroll (James
Purefoy, "Resident Evil"). The
new dark drama focuses on Eng-
lish-professor-turned-murderer
Carroll's ability to create a net-
work of followers from the con-
fines of his prison cell using the
Internet. Using these new pawns,
he escapes from jail, setting alco-
holic Hardy back on his trail.
What's most interesting about
the premise is the actual con-
struction of Carroll's followers,
all of them ready to sacrifice

A

"Give me Bacon or give me death"
their lives for his cause. There
isn't much time spent figuring
out the how and why of their
involvement, but the ambiguity is
intriguing and will hopefully be
explored in later episodes.
At a first glance, "The Fol-
lowing" is incredibly smart
in throwing off viewers from
guessing what comes next.
Periphery characters are shown
to be wholly replaceable, which
is both a strength and a weak-
ness: While it shows the truly
ruthless attitude of Carroll, it
also detracts from creating a
set of accountable secondary
characters. Those who populate
Carroll and Hardy's world seem
to have their days numbered -
but maybe that's the underlying
point. Yet, the ability to surprise
the audience with both plot and
character motives is no doubt

the show's greatest asset, and is
one that is called upon time and
time again.
The show is incredibly fast-
paced and entertaining, moving
through each storyline swiftly
in order to set all of the pieces
in motion. Bacon lives up to the
hype of his first notable network
television role, showing restraint
in Hardy's persistence. Purefoy
easily embodies the cruel and
calculating serial killer, mak-
ing Carroll relatable enough to
add dimension. Together, Bacon
and Purefoy rightfully carry the
show - their few scenes togeth-
er are excitingly charged and
intense.
Still, "The Following" feels
incredibly one-dimensional;
beyond the literal good-guy-
bad-guy chase, there are not
many other moving pieces.

The characters - though made
dynamic through the fantastic
performances - don'thave much
meat on their bones. There's a
backstory of the two men shar-
ing a lover, but it doesn't add
much to Hardy's determination
or Carroll's murderous ways.
The whole episode seems to
be building toward one moment;
one unaccomplished goal of Car-
roll's before he was hauled off to
the joint the first time. But that
moment comes and goes within
the hour, leavingthe trajectory of
the "The Following" somewhat
unclear. The show itself has its
moments, but none with such a
distinct destination.
Overall, "The Following" is
immensely gripping and well-
acted; if nothing else, you should
get excited for Kevin Bacon on
your television every week.

er of our dearly departed LCD
Soundsystem. The city is well-
known - among high schoolers,
at least - for its 18-and-under
club nights and men with copious
amounts of hair gel. James Mur-
phy, au contraire, is a style icon
whose former band's final gig
was at Madison Square Garden.
Maybe that's why he took almost
five hours to set up his turntables.
The barrage of no-name open-
ers wasn't particularly offensive,
and the crowd was too drunk to
care - except for the ennui-laden
hipster chick.in front of me, she
seemed miserable. But when it hit
midnight, people started getting
a little antsy.
Finally, at 12:40, we got our
first glimpse of Murphy. The
crowd - which was a head-
scratching combination of Ponti-
ac locals, intoxicated parents and
chambray-clad yuppies - had
been danc-"
ing along First seen on
unper- -the filter
turbed

for a few hours at this point, but
found its second wind upon see-
ing the man with the fantastic
beard set up four -four! - turn-
tables.
As a child of the digital DJ
revolution, I was astonished that
someone could have the manual
dexterity and timing to sync up
everything by hand, but James
Murphy is simply a product of a
more noble time. I could actually
watch him select records for the
hour-and-a-half set he played,
and his choices were damn-near
flawless. He may believe that he's
"losing his edge," but I didn't see
any hint of that. a
Murphy's underground pedi-
gree was on full burn as he
played deep tracks from all sorts
of funk, soul, rap and early elec-
tronic records. His set seemed
like something that would've
been played in the underground
clubs where Murphy developed
his skills. No huge bass drops, no
house beats, just live sampling
and a crowd that would've been
stopped in their tracks had they
been able to stop dancing.

CHAMPAIGON
SUPER
NOVA

Michigan 74, Illinois 60

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
CHAMPAIGN - Just minutes into
the game, redshirt junior forward Jor-
dan Morgan landed funny on his right
ankle and was limping off the court.
He immediately headed to the locker
-oom to get checked out, and freshman
forward Mitch McGary subbed in for
the starter.
Matching up against Illinois' inex-
perienced sophomore center Nnanna
Egwu on Sunday, the Michigan
men's basketball team was hoping
to exploit the mismatch with a rota-
tion of three big men in Morgan,
McGary and redshirt junior Jon
Horford, who is back from a knee
injury he suffered in December.
Morgan's injury didn't help
the Wolverines' plan to attack
the paint, but it wasn't much
of an issue for No. 2 Michi-
gan (6-1 BigTen, 19-1 overall).
McGary, Horford and red-
shirt freshman Max Bielfeldt
lied in for the injured
Morgan, and were big
factors in the Wol-
verines' 74-60 win
over Illinois on
- Sunday.
"(I) love how
many young kids
got out there
and played," sail
Michigan coach
John Beilein.
"Jordan Morgan
getting the ankle
injury early gave

three guys an opportunity to play that
haven't been getting as many minutes as
they'd like. (I was) really impressed with
how our big men filled in there."
. The forwards combined for 31 points
and 22 rebounds, and if the big men
weren't open, it was freshman guard Nik
Stauskas open on the backdoor cut or
sophomore guard Trey Burke driving to
the rim for alayup. The Wolverines tallied
42 points in the paint and shot 53 percent
from the field off a combination of post-
ups and open cutters.
McGary is typically the first man off
the bench for Michigan, and though he
had trouble protecting the basketball and
finishing his layups early on, he became
a force on the boards. The freshman was
often able to outmuscle his defender,
and finished with eight rebounds and six
points.
The Wolverines also had help on the
boards from freshman forward Glenn
Robinson III - the squad's leading
rebounder added six to Michigan's 36
total rebounds. Horford also contribut-
ed seven points and five rebounds in his
season-high 17 minutes, and Beilfelt had a
four point, two rebound effort on Sunday.
The forwards were also successful in con-
taining Egwu and forward Sam McLau-
rin, who totaled just 13 points.
"Guys stepped up toniight, (and) we
knew that with Morgan going down,"
Burke said.:"Coach calls him the minster
of defense - he's one ofthe older captains,
he's been in the program for years - so
once he went down, Jon and Max came in
and stepped up."
Added Robinson: "(Horford and Beil-
felt) are both getting better every day.

their ranking shows it.
Two weeks ago, Michigan
couldn't handle the pressure.
Then, the second-ranked Wolver-
ines walked into Value City Arena
in Columbus with that coveted
top spot within reach. On that
Sunday, just three days after then-
No. 1 Duke faltered against North
Carolina State, they were almost
assured of becoming the top-
ranked team in the country with a
victory.
But Michigan came out flat,
lacking energy in the first half
against the Buckeyes, fizzling
under the pressure. The freshmen
showed nerves and inexperience.
The Wolverines tumbled their way
to a 21-point deficit in the early
going of that contest, only to have a
failed late-game comeback.
Fast-forward to two weeks later.
After a quick re-scrambling of the
top-ranked teams in the national
polls, Michigan found itself in the
same exact position on Sunday,
trailing only Duke in the rank-

The best team you've never seen

c risler Center is home
to three teams. Those
teams are a combined
24-3 in the friendly and reno-
vated confines this year. That's
pretty neat.
You know about the men's
basketball team. You know
about the women's basketball
team, too. But have you taken
a visit4o the Crisler when
the hardwood is lifted, when.
mats and beams and bars are
sprawled across the arena floor?
Probably
not.
Well, let
me tell you
about that
third team
at Crisler.
It's one to be
proud of. It's
the Michigan STEPHEN J.
women's NESBITT
gymnastics
program,
currently No. 1 in the land, and
its success is no fluke.
Still, the gymnastics team is,
for my money, the most over-
looked varsity team on campus.
Meet Bev Plocki.
Her resume lists but one pro-
fessional job - head coach of
the Michigan women's gymnas-
tics program. Plocki took the
helm in Ann Arbor as a 23-year-
old former All-American and
hasn't budged in the last 23
years.
The program she inherited in
1989 was something of a train
wreck.
Michigan was coming off
a 2-19 season and had never
fielded an All-American in the
team's 16-year history.
As a Butler, Pa. native, Ala-
bama graduate and former
graduate assistant at West Vir-
ginia, Plocki - ne Beverly Fry
- had no ties to Michigan or its
suffering women's gymnastics
program.
Early on, she met Jim Plocki,
a strength and conditioning
coach for the Michigan football
and ice hockey teams. The two
hit it off, eventually married
and decided to stay in Ann
Arbor.
And the Michigan commu-
nity should thank its lucky stars
that they did.
A team isn't always hard
to build, buta program is. It
means changing tradition,
changing culture, changing
expectations. And Plocki did it
in two years.
Plocki turned a two-win
team into a 7-15 team in her first
year, then 13-12 the next. Then
the streak began. Michigan won
five consecutive Big Ten titles,
took second in 1998, won seven
more, took fourth in 2006 and
won five more before finishing
fourth again last year.
That's 18 Big Ten titles in 21
years. That's absurd consis-
tency, isn't it? Let's compare
it to the other teams housed
in Crisler: before last year, the
men's basketball team hadn't
won an outright title since 1986,
and the women's basketball
team has never won one.

Senior Katie Zurales, a three-time All-American, helps lead She Na. 1 eymoastics team in the nation. Michigan coach Bev Plocki has held sl one jab, asd is in her 23rd year at the helm of the

As for her coaching quali-
fications, Plocki has won
everything buta national cham-
pionship, and that could be just
around the corner - Michigan
has been runner-up twice. She
has coached six All-Americans,
been named Big Ten coach of
the year 10 times and NCAA
national coach of the year once.
So, I ask, what's kept you
away from Crisler?
The then-No. 2 Michigan
women's gymnastics team post-
ed a 197.350 in its last competi-
tion at Crisler. That might not
mean much to you, but it's the
highest team total since 2008.
A night earlier, No. 6 Ala-

bama squared off against LSU
at Coleman Coliseum in Tus-
caloosa, Ala. Plocki knows the
Crimson Tide quite well: you'll
remember, Alabama is her alma
mater. She understands the
tradition. She understands that
gymnastics just means some-
thing different there.
But she probably didn't
expect this disparity.
Michigan had just 2,114 seats
filled at Crisler. Alabama had a
recorded attendance of 13,912
- higher even than the capacity
of Crisler. A week later, 15,075
were on hand to watch the
Crimson Tide.
That's just a whole different
baligame.
It's easy to see why an elite
recruit would relish an oppor-

tunity to compete at Alabama,
live on TV and in front of sell-
out crowds.
But it begs the question, how
can the Wolverines, with a
roster that lists just one Michi-
gan native, pull in the caliber
of recruits year after year to
remain a national title con-
tender?
Plocki tries to keep the
answer short.
"Until we can get to a point
where we can get that many
people coming to our competi-
tions, it's really a matter of sell-
ing Michigan," she said.
"If you are an individual who
wants the dog-and-pony show,
then Michigan's not the right
place for you to go to school
anyway. You need to be coming

to school here because you're
serious about your education,
you want to get the most valu-
able degree that's available
to you and you want to have a
great experience."
You probably think every
coach claims to sell the educa-
tion. And they do. But there's
something different about gym-
nastics.
"Stereotypically, gymndsts
are very good students, good
time managers," Plocki admit-
ted.
If you think about it, a career
in gymnastics has about the
shortest career span out there.
Gymnastics isn't a profession
for hardly anyone. You're not
going to be competing at 28, so
it only makes sense to sell Mich-

Despite loss, Wolverines turn in
their best performance of year

igan, to sell the education.
The largest circuit is the
Olympics, where gymnastics
truly thrives.and consistently
earns some of the highest view-
ership of the Olympic Games.
But if you're in college, you're
probably past your prime for
international competition, so
selecting a college isn't an ath-
letics decision as much as it is a
career decision.
"We feel like we can offer the
package between the national
championship-caliber athletic
program and the Ivy League-
quality education," Plocki said.
While she didn't hesitate to
praise the dedication of the fans
that do trickle into the Crisler
Center for competitions, Plocki
did admit that finding ways
to fill seats is still a work in
progress. Huge banners are up
around Briarwood Mall, a few
miles from campus, showing an
athlete or two and the season
schedule.
It's hard to attract that atten-
tion.
"We continually strive to get
the word out," Plocki said. "If
people develop an interest in
wanting to come out and check
out the sport of women's gym-
nastics, they'll see why there
are 13,000 people who go to a
gym meet in Alabama, Utah,
Georgia.
"It's really a fabulous event,
These athletes are genuinely
athletes, and the things that
they do are pretty incredible.
It's just a great sport and if you
come once you typically really
enjoy it and want to continue to
come back."
So, surprise yourself and
give ita chance, make your way
down on a Friday night. It'll be
worth your time.
It's tough to get out of the
shadows at Michigan, but there
just might be enough room for
two No. 1s at Crisler.

For The Daily
On Saturday night, the -No. 1
Michigan women's gymnastics
team showed consistency and
improvement by recording its
best road score of the season.
"What we're doing currently
is working really well for us,"
said sophomore Sachi Sugiya-
ma. "I couldn't ask for a better
team."
Michigan finished runner-
up at the quad meet hosted at
the Minnesota Sports Pavilion
by a close margin, losing to No.
12 Minnesota, 196.800-196.775.
No. 20 Central Michigan and
Iowa State finished third and
fourth, respectively.
"I am very proud of this
team," said Michigan coach
Bev Plocki. "I actually thought
that this might have been the
best performance of the season
so far, even though the score

didn't reflect it."
The captains - junior Joan-
na Sampson and senior Katie
Zurales - led 'the team with
second- and third-place finish-
es in the all-around. Sampson
also took first in the uneven
bars while Zurales tied for sec-
ond on the balance beam.
The Wolverines started the
meet with an impressive 49.100
on the uneven bars, and per-
formed strongly despite a fall
from freshman Lindsay Wil-
liams.
The other five Michigan
gymnasts recorded scores of
9.800 or better, dropping Wil-
liams' 9.225 out of contention.
Sampson led with a 9.850 while
Sugiyama and senior Brittnee
Martinez tied for second with
9.825s. Junior Shelby Gies and
Zurales followed with a pair of
9.800s.
Michigan recorded another
49.100 on the balance beam for

a team total of 93.200 - tying
it with Minnesota for the early
lead. Gies and Zurales scored
identically yetagain for second-
place finishes on beam with
9.850's. Junior Reema Zakharia
was added to the beam lineup
for the first time this season,
and her score of 9.775 tied her
career best.
After earning a 49.250 on
the floor exercise, the Wolver-
ines pulled ahead of the Golden
Gophers by a slim 0.100 points
going into the final rotation.
Sugiyama led the team with a
9.875 followed by 9.850's from
Sampson, Zurales, and Zakhar-
ia.
In the final rotation, Michi-
gan scored a season-best 49.325
on the vault, highlighted by
Sugiyama capturing the event
title.
"(Sugiyama) did all solid
events and topped it off by
sticking the landing on her

vault," Plocki said. "She nailed
it cold. Ina meet that was being
judged rigorously, her vault
was that good that they had to
give it a 9.950."
Zurales added a 9.875 on the
vault, while freshman Briley
Casanova and Sampson con-
tributed 9.825s.
"The team was determined
and they knew the meet was
very close," Plocki said. "They
stepped up and had their best
performance (on vault)."
Despite finishing the meet
on a high note, the Wolverines
were unable to hold on to their
lead after Minnesota posted
the top-five floor exercise
scores of the meet and recorded
a season-best 49.450 - narrow-
ly edging Michigan out.
"We did really, really well,"
Sugiyama said. "You know the
scoring was kind of tight, but
we deserved every tenth we
got."

Michigan breaks records, drowns Sparty

By SHANNON LYNCH
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - When
junior Angie Chokran jumpJed
into McCaffree Pool for the first
time at Michigan State, she knew
her family was right there on
deck to motivate her. And by fam-
ily, she meant her 35 teammates
that make up the No. 25 Michigan
women's swimming and diving
team.
Most families like to relax
on Friday nights - whether it's
hanging out at home, falling
asleep on the couch or enjoying a
worry-free evening. But this fam-
ily had a very different agenda.
Mike Bottom - the father, if
you will - was looking for more
than just a victory out of his team:
he wanted to break records. The
Wolverines gave him just that,
outscoring the Spartans 174-120
and shattering four pool records.
Before the team was even able
to jump in the pool for warm-up,

Bottom and his coaching staff
gave his team what they like to
call a "sudden change," and the
meet suddenly became about
more than perfecting skills, tech-
niques and speeds.
It became a game.
"The coaches start looking
at the recordv
board," Chokran
said. "I was like,
'What are you
doing?' They
made this game
out of this meet
and said, 'What
do we love to do?-
We love watch-
ing people break records.'
Added Bottom: "You can see
it's an old facility; it's got alot of
history, which is something I
try to talk up. Those records are
really old, right? They've been,
around for a while, so it's a moti-
vating setting for us as a Michi-
gan team."
McCaffree Pool was built in

1959, and many of the records
held in that facility date back 30
years or more.
The Wolverines took their
coach's challenge to heart, start-
ing off the meet with a victory in
the 400-yard medley relay. They
continued their success through-
out the night,
finishing with
victories in 13 of
16 races and four
pool records in
the 100/200-yard
backstroke and
100/200-yard
breaststroke.
Chokran earned
the latter two records, with times
of 1:01.28 and 2:15.05 respectively.
Chokran's accomplishments
have greatly contributed to the
success of her team. She's cur-
rently the third-ranked, 200-yard
breaststroker and seventh-ranked
100-yard breaststroker in the Big
Ten. Last week, she was named
Big Ten Swimmer of the Week, in

addition to winning three events
on Jan. 18, contributing to the win
over Ohio State.
"I couldn't have done what
I did today without (my team-
mates) behind me every step
of the way and throughout this
week," Chokran said. "Like I said,
the training was more important
and I had people pushing me
every single day."
The victory against Michigan
State was a family victory and
wins in the relay heats showed
the versatility and strength of a
range of Michigan swimmers,
including freshmen Ali Deloof,
Zoe Mattingly and senior Deidre
Jones, whose participation in the
400-yard medley relay and 200-
yard freestyle relay led to two
first-place spots.
"We were only a tenth off in
both relays, which is even more
special to me because that means
our team is coming along," Bot-
tom said. "We have a lot of young
girls so we're excited."

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Freshman forward Andrew Copp scored a power-play goal on Saturday, but it wasn't nearly enough for the Wolverines.
Another week, another sweep

Western Michigan
takes both games
for the first time
since 1986
By MICHAEL LAURILA
DaiUX Sports Editor
KALAMAZOO - Not once,
but twice did the Michigan hock-
ey team squander a first-period
lead against Western Michigan
this weekend.
During Friday's contest, the
Wolverines opened up the game
with a 2-0
lead in the MICHIGAN 2
first six WMU 3
minutes,
only to end MICHIGAN 1
up falling WMU 5
3-2 to the
Broncos. Saturday night's game
wasn't much-different as Michi-
gan took a 1-0 lead into the first
intermission, and again, it didn't
capitalize in a 5-1 loss to complete
the sweep.
"Last night we had a good
start, but then we got behind
in the second period and we
couldn't answer"the bell in the
third period," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson on Satur-
day. "Tonight the second period
was our Achilles heel. We needed
the first goal in the third period
and we never even had a scoring
chance."
The strong first period wasn't
enough for the Wolverines (5-12-
2 CCHA, 8-15-2 overall) to get
going on Saturday, as they went
on to allow three second-period
goals to Western Michigan (11-4-
2,15-6-4).
After Friday's game, which
wasn't overly physical or chippy,
Saturday night had a differ-
ent feel just 34 seconds into the
game. Sophomore forward Alex
Guptill and freshman defense-

man Jacob Trouba were both
given two-minute penalties for
roughing after the whistle along
with Western Michigan's Luke
Witkowski and Nolan Laporte.
This series of events that almost
led to a fight started when Gup-
till and Witkowski nearly came
to blows following a stoppage of
play. All four players were sent to
the box, but neither team played
with a man down.
With Guptill and Trouba still
in the box, sophomore defense-
man Mike Szuma picked up a
tripping penalty, sending the
Wolverines on their first penalty
kill of the night. Michigan's pen-
alty killers, who held the CCHA's
top power-play unit scoreless on
Friday, continued to have success
against the Broncos.
The Wolverines went on their
second power play of the night
with 4:35 remaining in the first
period and freshman forward
Andrew Copp tallied his fourth
goal of the season only nine sec-
onds into the man-advantage.
The play was setup by a faceoff
win by senior forward A.J. Treais
deep in the Broncos' zone to start
off the power play. Despite many
good chances by Western Michi-
gan, Michigan would take the 1-0'
lead intothe first intermission.
With 15:52 left in the second
period, the Broncos got on the
board after a soft slap shot that
was partially deflected found its
way past junior goaltender Adam
Janecyk, tying up the game at
one. When senior defenseman
Lee Moffie took a penalty less
than a minute later, Western
Michigan put in its first power-
play goal of the series to give the
Broncos their first lead of the
game. This livened up the crowd
and took away any of the Wolver-
ines' momentum completely.
"It's a game of momentum,"
Berenson said. "We didn't hold
the momentum and we couldn't
recover the momentum."

The Wolverines had a chance
to tie up the game with 4:56
remaining in the period when
freshman forward Cristoval
"Boo" Nieves flicked a pass to a
rushing sophomore defenseman
Mike Chiasson, who had a wide-
open look, but he misplayed the
puck and barely got off a shot.
Offensive miscues were a com-
mon theme for the Wolverines
this weekend. Whether it was a
missed-timed shot, or a missed
open net, the Wolverines failure
to capitalize plagued them dur-
ing both losses.
Ninety seconds after the miss,
Western Michigan continued to
make the best of its chances on a
3-on-2 fast break, when forward
Colton Hargrove buried his sec-
ond goal of the series off of a one-
timer. Hargrove's goal made the
score 3-I and would conclude the
scoring for the second period.
After the three-goal second
period, the Broncos weren't done
- they scored two goals in the
first four minutes of the third
frame to extend the lead to four
goals, crushing any hope that
Michigan had of making a come-
back.
"Teams and leaders step up
when adversity conies our way,
especially when a team gets two
quick goals like they did today,"
Copp said. "Obviously it's a
momentum shift for them, but we
need to answer that right back."
After the fifth goal allowed
Berenson pulled Janecyk for
freshman Jared Rutledge. Beren-
son said that the decision to
replace Janecyk was a combina-
tion of trying to get Rutledge -
who hadn't appeared in a game
since Jan. 4 when Michigan was
defeated by the U.S. NDTP team
- playing time and also getting
Janecyk out of a bad situation.
The Wolverines will be back
in action next weekend on Friday
night against Michigan State at
Yost Ice Arena.

Sometimes they might be on scout

ing us sometimes on the drills.
They're great players and they
just need to keep doing what
they're doing."
Sunday's game marked Hor-
ford's third game back from his
injury, and though Beilein has felt
that Horford still isn't 100 per-
cent, he's been impressed with his
progression so far.
"For him to get to where he
needs to be, (Horford) needs to
get reps in both practice and in
games," Beilein said. "Because
of injuries, it's been tough to get
him the reps he needs. He needs
high.volume of reps.... I thought
he played really well the other day
against Purdue (and) practiced
really well the last couple days.
He's got enough volume right now
where we felt he could play, and
with Jordan hurt, it expedited it."
But with Morgan in warmups
and Horford in to start the second
half, the Illini (2-5, 15-6) made
some important adjustments.
Instead of settling for outside
shots - Illinois took 15 3-pointers
in the first half alone - it started
driving to the basket with much
success.
Early in the second stanza,
Illini guards Tracy Abrams, Bran-
don Paul and D.J. Richardson
led Illinois on a quick 5-0 run to

pull within five. The trio was eas-
ily able to drive to the basket and
draw fouls - all nine free throw
attempts for Illinois came in the
second half - and combined for
37 of the Illini's 60 total points.
But the Wolverines responded
with a long run of their own to
finalize the 14-point victory. Led
by Burke, Michigan extended its
lead to as much as 18 points late
in the second half. Burke finished
with a game-high 19 points, and
four of the Wolverines' starters
finished in double figures. Rob-
inson and Stauskas each tallied
14 points, and junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. added 12 points.
As a result of the Wolverines'
push, Illinois was forced to speed
up its offense and shoot from
beyond the arc. The Illini finished
at a 24-percent clip from three,
continuing its poor shooting from
the field, and the Wolverines'
defense forced 15 turnovers by
forcing Illinois into a faster-paced
offense.
"The numbers Illinois hit had
a lot to do with a great, tough
attitude by our defense," Beilein
said. "(But) because a lot of my
teams have been based on three
point shooting, sometimes it's
just a matter of having one game
where a couple guys hit a shot and
it gives everybody confidence.
My teams have had incredible
dry spells at times, and when you
play that way, it can get difficult
at times. ...They'll shoot their way
out of it eventually."

RANKING
From Page 1B
last week, the Wolverines were
offered another opportunity to
seize that desired top ranking.
Only Michigan did more than
that with its victory. The Wol-
verines demonstrated that they
could handle the hype, that the
target on their back hadn't got-
ten too big. They played like a
much-improved team from two
weeks ago.
Michigan came out with life
on Sunday. The guards pushed
the ball, and the bigs played
the aggressors on the glass.
And most important of all, the
freshmen rose to the occasion.
Swingman Nik Stauskas led
the team with nine early points,
and together with forwards
Glenn Robinson III and Mitch
McGary, the first-year play-
ers accounted for more than
half of the team's 35 first-half
points. The difference between
two weeks ago and Sunday was
apparent to sophomore guard
Trey Burke.
"I think the freshmen did a
good job of stepping up and not
playing out of control," Burke
said. "They stayed poised"
But that wasn't all. When

dan Morgan exited with a

The Michigan women's basket-
ball team came to play. Well, most
of it did.
The 23rd-ranked Wolverines
were going for a season sweep of
Iowa (5-2 Big Ten, 16-5 overall),
but were IOWA 63

success from a 68-64 victory back
in Iowa City on January 6.
After starting its afternoon
off with a ceremony honoring
senior center Rachel Sheffer's
100th career point accomplish-
ment, Michigan (5-2, 16-4) took
the court against the Hawkeyes.
Little did they know that would
be her last highlight of Sunday's
63-571oss.
Recently Michigan has strug-
gled getting its offense going
in the early part of games, but
Sheffer had proven to be the lone
bright spot, averaging 19.5 points
per game in the last two games.
But in today's loss against Iowa
that was anything but the case.
The Wolverines came outready
on offense and hit 41.5 percent of
their shots, a significant improve-
ment from their 35.2-percent
shooting average over the last
two games. But their bright spot
in Sheffer ended the afternoon

her freshman year. I
Instead, it was senior guard
Jenny Ryan who led the way.
Ryan started the game by taking
the opening tip and pulling up
for a quick jumper, then hustled
back on defense and drew a foul,
setting the tone for the aggres-
sive style of play the Wolverines
embodied until the last seven
minutes of the game when they
lost their spark.

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
It wasn't surprising how
much applause senior forward
Rachel Sheffer received while
accepting a ceremonial ball in a
pregame ceremony to note her
becoming the 23rd player in
program history to score 1,000
career points.What was surpris-
ing was that Sheffer was held
scoreless for the entirety of the
Michigan women's basketball
team's 63-57loss to Iowa (5-2 Big
Ten, 16-5 overall).
After scoring 26 points
against Iowa in their first
matchup of the season earlier
this month and being the Wol-
verines' leading scorer the past
two games by scoring a com-
bined 39 points and grabbing 16
rebounds, it seemed that Sheffer
would continue her hot streak,
or at least contribute ina benefi-
cial way the second time around.
Instead, the four other Michi-
gan seniors combined for 30 of
the team's 32 points-at halftime
and 52 of 57 for the game.
Though the Michigan senior
core carrying the scoring bur-
den for the team is nothing new
- they have combined for 82 per-
cent of the team's scoring this
season - it has typically been
with five scorers and Sheffer as
the second-leading scorer with
13.2 points per contest.
On Sunday, with Sheffer post-
ing her first scoreless game since
her freshman year, the team
relied on a senior quartet of
guard Jenny Ryan, and forwards
Nya Jordan, Kate Thompson,
and Sam Arnold.
Ryan, who entered the game
averaging 11.1 points per game,
realized early on that her scor-
ing would. be needed for the
Wolverines (5-2,16-4). Through-
out the season, Ryan has picked
up her scoring when needed and
continued that trend Sunday by
posting a career-high 20 points

on 9-for-14 shooting from the
field. She started almost imme-
diately against the Hawkeyes,
scoring Michigan's first two bas-
kets while assisting on the third
to give the Wolverines an early
lead.
"As a senior and as a person
on the floor, I have to be a threat
and that's just what happened,"
Ryan said.
Ryan wasn't just a threat on
the offensive end, as she took

production from Michigan's
usual two leading scorers, Shef-
fer and Thompson, ultimately
doomed the Wolverines.
"I think Jenny knows when
Kate and Rachel are struggling
that she really needs to step up,
and she made every bigtime shot
that she needed to make," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "We just couldn't get any-
one else to make them."
Though Thompson scored 10
points in the game, her effort
wasn't enough without pro-
duction from Sheffer. After
recording 23 points, including a
program-record seven 3-point-
ers against Northwestern,
Thompson has cooled off from
behind the arc, making just
7-for-28.
"She's going to have days like
this," Barnes Arico said. "When
other teams are keying on her
like this, other people need to
step up. And when you have both
her and Rachel having a bad day,
it really hurts us."
Without the duo's inside and
outside shooting working, the
team basically had no real offen-
sive plan that would work. It was
strongly evidenced by the team's
dry spell from tle A'd u
seven minutes remaining in the
game. Though they had a series
of free throws fall for them, the
team's lack of depth at the point-
guard position ultimately cost
the Wolverines the game.
Michigan relied on Ryan, who
played nearly 40 minutes for the
third straight game and for the
most part she came through.
But as the game progressed, her
tiredness from playing three
games in one week seemed to
catch up to her.
"I think I took -her out for six
seconds," Barnes Arico said.
"That's probably all she's going
to get. I think obviously she's
worn out. I think the final four
minutes of the game, she was
worn down a bit."

points and seven rebounds Sunday.

'Super' Blue flies past Stanford

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Redshirt senior captain Syque
Caesar set a new NCAA record on
the parallel bars Saturday night
for the Michigan men's gymnas-
tic team.
And Cam Newton was in atten-
dance to see it all.
Okay, the Carolina Panthers'
quarterback wasn't actually at
Cliff Keen Arena, but his sig-
nature "Superman" celebration
was, as performed by Michigan
sophomore Stacey Ervin after
sticking his landing on the vault
that earned him a score of 15.050.
And it was a good thing the com-
ic-book hero was there because
the Wolverines needed a cast of
superhero-like performances -
like Caesar's - to take down their
version of Kryptonite: Stanford.
The third-ranked Wolverines
tallied a total of 439.750 points
to best No. 2 Stanford, which fin-
ished with 429.350. -
Caesar tallied a 15.900 on the
parallel bars - a new NCAA
record. The previous high mark
was 15.850 earnedby Tim McNeil
of California on April 5, 2008.
Led by Ervin's 15.400 mark,
Michigan's floor exercise -
ranked first in the nation - took
four of the top five spots en route
to a score of 74.750.
"We have a strong floor team,"
said Michigan coach Kurt Golder.

it

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Sophomore Stacey Ervin did his best
Superman impression Saturday night.
"(It) just built the energy for the
whole rest of the evening."
The momentum from the floor
carried over into the second rota-
tion - the pommel horse. Junior
Matt Freeman and freshman
Nolan Novak led the Wolverines
to a 71.150 mark for the exercise
while taking first and second
place, respectively.
Following just a .15-point
defeat on the rings, Michigan
swept the final three events.
Sophomore Adrian de los
Angeles, who won the all-around
with a score of 89.200, placed first
on the vault with a 15.300. Four
other Wolverines posted scores of
14.750 or higher to round out the
top five.

De los Angeles finished the
night by placing second on both
the parallel bars (15.400) and the
high bar (14.550), behind Syque
Caesar who notched the top spot
on the final two rotations. It was
de los Angeles' second all-around
victory this season, having also
captured the title last week at the
2013 Windy City Invitational in
Chicago.
"It's not surprising (that de los
Angeles won the all-around),"
Golder said. "He's just a real hard
steady worker.... He's a gamer."
The victory against Stanford
should give Michigan a boost of
confidence moving forward.
"I'm extremely proud of how
this team is coming together,"
Ervin said. "We have a great team
chemistry, and I feel that trans-
lates into our gymnastics so well.
It definitely helps knowing that
(we all have) each other's back."
It will help to have some more
superhero-like performances this
season. And Clark Kent's new
high-energy alter ego, Stacey
Ervin, looks like he'll be a deter-
mining factor in Michigan's suc-
cess.
"I always get excited about my
gymnastics (and) other people's
gymnastics," Ervin said. "During
the competition, we like to keep
the high energy, and I like to lead
through that, you know, try and
get everyone else as excited as I
am. It's definitely working so far."
