MEDICAL MARIJUANA ORDINANCE
* City Council
delays vote on
medical pot
ordinance

Council rejects
amendment to keep
dispensary owner
identities anonymous
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
At its meeting last night, the
Ann Arbor City Council postponed
voting on an ordinance that would
impose legal guidelines on medical
marijuana licensing in Ann Arbor.
S The ordinance already had been
Spostponed at two prior meetings
and nowwill be reconsidered at the
council's next meeting on Feb. 7 in
order to review possible amend-
ments to the proposed law. Midway
through its discussion, the City
Council rejected an amendment to
the ordinance that sought to better
protect the anonymity of cultiva-
tion facility and dispensary own-
ers.
During the public commentary
section of the meeting, several area
residents expressed concerns over
a stipulation in the ordinance that
would require owners of dispen-
saries and cultivation facilities to
place their contact information -
including their names and address-
es - on an official list.
City Council member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) told council
that this requirement is not in the
licensing guidelines for other busi-

nesses like liquor stores.
However, both City Attorney
Stephen Postema and City Coun-
cil member Stephen Rapundalo
(D-Ward 2) said liquor licenses do
actually require licensees to pro-
vide comparable information to
that outlined in the marijua-
na licensing ordinance.
City Council member Christo-
pher Taylor (D-Ward 3) added that
he believes the city law shouldn't
seek to protect the information of
business owners, which includes
dispensaries and cultivation facili-
ties.
"I think that the line of protect-
ing anonymity falls for patients and
caregivers rather than business
owners," Taylor said.
Following the rejection of the
amendment concerning anonym-
ity, Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
proposed that council postpone
voting on the ordinance until Feb.
7 to allow City Council members
time to consider other possible
amendments.
Hieftje added that the extra
time will enable Council members
to consult with the City Attorneys
Office regarding the validity of
possible amendments. Following
Hieftje's suggestion, City Council
member Marcia Higgins (D-Ward
4) motioned to postpone voting on
the ordinance, and the City Council
members unanimously agreed.
Responding to concerns that the
City Council is taking too much

Space to incubate
businesses, spur
economic growth
By CAITLIN HUSTON
DailyNewsEditor
In response to the new busi-
ness opportunities rising out
of campus-based research, the
University's Venture Accelerator
opened yesterday in the North
Campus Research Complex.

As part of the University's
Tech Transfer program, an orga-
nization that finds ways to use
University technology in the
marketplace, the Venture Accel-
erator is laboratory and office
space for new businesses and will
aid with the commercialization
of their products - all with the
goal of helping the region. The
businesses housed in the 16,000
square-foot space all work with
University-owned research.
More than 500 members of the
University community, business

and economic development lead-
ers, entrepreneurs, venture capi-
talists, government officials and
attendees mingled in the accel-
erator offices before filling the
bridges overlooking the Venture
Center.
Speaking before the crowd,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said she believes the
companies in the accelerator,
along with other research and
business centers in the NCRC, can
help revitalize the economy at the
state level and beyond.

"We are eager to collaborate
with companies, to drive trans-
formative research that can
change the world," Coleman
said. "The NCRC, the Office of
Tech Transfer (and) the Business
Engagement Center are launch
pads for this critical work we
have in front of us."
In addition to the Venture
Accelerator,, the Office of Tech
Transfer and the Business
Engagement Center also celebrat-

Shriver remembered for
work with Peace Corps

'U' alumni reflect on
founding director's
committment
to service program
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily NewsEditor
Sargent Shriver, the first direc-
tor of the Peace Corps, died at
age 95 in Bethesda, Md. yesterday
afternoon after an eight-year battle

with Alzheimer's disease.
Shriver's compassion affected
the University, where the idea for
the Peace Corps was given life by
Shriver with the help of then-Uni-
versity graduate students Al and
Judy Guskin. Plans for the pro-
gram were set into motion follow-
ing a speech given by Kennedy on
the steps of the Michigan Union at
2 a.m. on Oct. 14,1960.
After the Guskins rallied for
support on campus, they later met
with Kennedy to begin converting
the idea for the Peace Corps into

a realized organization. Shriver
played a key role in the initial stag-
es of the program after Kennedy
advised him to work as director of
the Peace Corps program- a posi-
tionhe held from 1961to1966.
In addition to his predominant
role in developing the Peace Corps
under the administration of his
brother-in-law, former President
John F. Kennedy, Shriver is also
known for his work on a variety of
initiatives like the War on Poverty
and the Special Olympics, which

By CLAIRE HALL
Daily StaffReporter
Speaking last night before
a small crowd at the Michigan
League, the head of a Jerusalem-
based think tank advocated for a

two-state solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.
In a speech entitled "Partners
for Peace: Do they exist? Where
are they now?" Gershon Baskin,
CEO and founder of the Israel/
Palestine Center for Research and
Information, praised the efforts of
the current Palestinian leadership
while condemning their Israeli
counterparts.
"It saddens me deeply me, as an
Israeli patriot, as anIsraeli citizen,

as someone who defines himself
as a Zionist, that the government
of Israel today is not a partner for
peace," Baskin said.
The Israeli government's reluc-
tance must be overcome soon,
Baskin added, because for the
first time ever, there's a deadline
on the resolution of the conflict.
According to Baskin, the current
Palestinian leadership will lose its
ability to govern by the end of 2011

Engineering prof.
exposes flaws in
India voting system
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Alex Halderman, an assis-
tant professor in the College of
Engineering, was walking down
a street in India when he saw a

newspaper headline that said
he had been deported from the
country.
The Indian Express reported
that Halderman had been deport-
ed on Dec. 12 for attempting to
present his research on problems
with India's electronic voting
system. However, Halderman
and his Dutch research colleague
Rop Gonggrijp narrowly avoided
deportation by arranging to stay
in India for tourism purposes

only and not to present their
research.
Halderman, who teaches
electrical engineering and com-
puter science at the University,
worked with seven colleagues on
a study titled, "Security Analy-
sis of India's Electronic Voting
Machines." The Indian Election
Commission and other govern-

Bringing Colombia to the classroom
Q: What classes do you teach? to Peru, where they stayed in the rural the idea of the museum as a satellite. I'm


I teach Spanish 102 and Spanish 232:
Museum of the Andean Region. It's
about four countries - Colombia, Ecua-
dor, Peru and Bolivia. We mainly learn
about traditions in these four countries,
but for me the most important thing is
how thesetraditions arestillrelevant to
the present. The traditions are the capi-
tal - the human capital of the world.
Q: What experiences made you
familiar with these traditions?
I'm a mountain girl. I was born in
Sogamoso in the Andes of Colombia.
And there was something about Peru
that kind of called me and that I was
kind of intrigued about. I wanted to go
ahead and really experience the culture
and bring it here first hand, so I wrote
a proposal to the University to go to
Peru for two months. I stayed with a
rural community with my friend Maria,
where she taught me how to weave, and
I took more classes in her house. Then
I wrote a proposal to take 10 students

community and learned to weave. Then
last year, again through the Global
Intercultural Experience for Under-
graduates, I took 14 other students to
Peru. After experiencing the culture, I
can transmit that passion, and now they
want to experience and participate in
the culture.
Q: What is your teaching style
like?
Something that I do in my classes
is that I try to bring the culture in the
class materially. I bring a lot of objects.
I've won several grants to go back to
Peru and Bolivia and gather materials
so that's one less degree of separation
between the student and the culture.
I wear my costumes from Peru and
Colombia, and I teach class like that. I
bring a carnival to class withlots of cos-
tumes. That's my goal - that students
do not learn from the book but have a
hands-on experience. I also take my
students to the museum because I like

like I can'tjust teach in my classroom -
there is life outside.
Q: How do you like teaching atthe
University?
Ilove it, and it's all because of the stu-
dents. I can have fun with them. Some-
times I feel I'm in a playground and
I hope they feel like they didn't go to
class, but that they did something. And
the students give so much if you ask.
One of my favorite activities is to have
coffee with my students, especially ex-
students. They talk about what they do,
what they eat, what they watch, same
for me. I like to dedicate time for them.
Q: Do you do research?
My research is going to these places
and bringing the culture back to Michi-
gan. One of my projects is an exhibition
(of photography from the Arhuacos
people of Colombia) that's going to be in
September or October in the Michigan
Union.

as the Palestinian Authority plans
to unilaterally declare statehoodby
the end of the year.
Baskin argued that the only solu-
tion is to create a separate Palestin-
ian state. Otherwise, he said, the
conflict will remain one of identity
rather than territory.
"Today the circumstances are
different because we have a Pal-
estinian leadership which for the
first time in the history of the Pal-
estinian national struggle is doing
everything right," he said.
Baskin noted that Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas and
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad have
committed themselves to imple-
menting the obligations set down
in President George W. Bush's 2003
"road map" for peace.
Meanwhile, Baskin said, the Pal-
estinians are in talks to gain the
support of the United States when
it petitions to become a member of
the United Nations later this year.
Becoming a UN member state,
Baskin said, would be a "game-
changer."
"It may not change anything on
the ground, but ... once Palestine

is 'a member state of t eUnfited
Nations, Israel is io longer occupy-
ing undefined disputed territory,"
Baskin said.
According to Baskin, solutions
do exist for the many conflicts
the Israelis and Palestinians face,
including questions of what to do
with refugees and how to come to
an agreement on the status of Jeru-
salem as the capital of a future Pal-
estinian state.
"This conflict is resolvable, and
we know how to do it," he said.
"There isn't a single issue which we
don't know how to resolve. It is the
mostcresearched conflict in the his-
tory of conflict."
Baskin was invited to speak on
campus by J Street U. In an inter-
view last night, LSA sophomore
Yonah Lieberman, chair of the
organization, said J Street U's mis-
sion is to "fill avoid" inthe dialogue
on campus about the Israeli-Pales-
tinian conflict.
"Our slogan is, 'pro-Israel, pro-
Palestine, pro-peace"' Lieberman
said. "We really think that both
sides have legitimate qualms and
legitimate points when it comes
to where the final status and final
agreements are goingto be."
Baskin, an American by birth,
said he's long been vocal on Israe-

organization, IPCRI, functions
to develop policy options on the
subject, according to the organiza-
tion's website.
"The belief that I grew up with
was that in moving to Israel, it's
important to dedicate my life to
making Israel a better place,"
Baskin said in an interview after
the lecture, "and I have dedicated
the last 33 years that I've been liv-
ing in Israel to working for peace.
Lieberman said he has been
interested in the Israeli-Palestin-
ian conflict for nearly his whole
life, adding that Baskin gave the
best speech he's ever heard about
the topic.
"I've never heard anyone speak
so eloquently and so brilliantly
about the conflict in a way that
matches up with my own ideals,"
Lieberman said.
In an interview after the event,
Baskin said the audience seemed
very receptive of his arguments.
Business sophomore Allison Ber-
man, however, said she wasn't con-
vinced.
"I thought it (was) a lot of rheto-
ric," she said.

Cartoonist faces attacker in court

Man tried to break
into Westergaard's
house with axe
COPENHAGEN, Denmark
(AP) - He lives under round-the-
clock protection and travels in an
armored SUV. Bodyguards are
posted in a shack outside his home,
which is equipped with a panic
room that saved him from an ax-
wielding intruder.
With a few strokes of a pen, Kurt
Westergaard's life changed forever:
hisdrawingoftheProphet Muham-
mad wearing a bomb-shaped tur-
ban has made him a hunted man.
This week, the 75-year-old car-
toonist faces the man police say
tried to kill him on New Year's Day,
2010, as the Somali's terror trial
gets under way.
"I lead an existence that is full of
angst,"Westergaard told The Asso-
ciated Press in a recent interview.
His caricature was considered
among the most offensive of the 12
cartoons of Muhammad published
by Danish newspaper Jyllands-
Posten in September 2005, trig-

gering a firestorm of protests that
rippled across the Islamic world
four months later.
The angry mobs calmed down
after a few weeks, but the Islamist
extremists did not; Denmark,
Jyllands-Posten and Westergaard
became high-profile targets in
their jihad.
Authorities feared Westergaard
- a tall, bearded man who walks
with a cane and speaks in a grave-
ly voice - was at risk of an attack
similar to the 2004 murder of film-
maker Theo van Gogh, who was
killed by a Muslim fanatic angered
by movie the Dutchman made that
criticized Islam.
The cartoonist was placed under
policeprotection inFebruary2008,
after police said two Tunisian men
plotted to kill him. They were
deported without charges.
When the attack finally came,
at his home in western Den-
mark, Westergaard reacted out of
instinct, following instructions
drilled into him by Danish police.
He didn't even see the intruder.
Upon hearing the glass door fac-
ing the garden shatter, he rushed
inside the bathroom - reinforced

with a metal-plated door to serve
as a panic room - and alerted
police."I thoughtto myself: Now it's
happening," Westergaard recalled.
He heard his then 6-year-old
granddaughter Stephanie scream
from the living room, as the ax-
wielding attacker tried to break
down the door of the panic room.
"Then the longest minutes of
my life started," Westergaard said.
"He hammered the ax against the
door and I wondered whether the
door would resist. Would he leave
Stephanie unharmed?"
The door held. The attacker left
the house, and was confronted by
police, who pepper-sprayed him,
then shot him in the knee as he
hurled the ax at an officer, investi-
gators said.
Westergaard and his grand-
daughter were unharmed.
"I got away. But he's the real
victim, who is likely going to sit
behind bars for quite a while and
will have enough time to think
through what happened," Wester-
gaard told AP this week about the
intruder, a 29-year-old Somali
man charged with terrorism and
attempted murder.

Lieberman plans
to announce
retirement today,
officials say
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen.
Joe Lieberman, the 2000 Demo-
cratic vice presidential nominee
who angered the party by back-
ing Republican John McCain for
president in 2008, will retire and
not seek a fifth term, Democratic
officials said yesterday.
Word of Lieberman's deci-
sion came just hours after North
Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad also
announced he would retire, leav-
ing Senate Democrats with two
seats to defend in a difficult politi-
cal environment.
Lieberman plans to announce
his decision midday today at an
event in Stamford, Conn. Lieber-
man nearly won the vice presi-
dency on the Democratic ticket
with running mate Al Gore in
2000.
Democratic officials, who
requested anonymity because
they were not authorized to speak
publicly, said yesterday that the
independent who usually votes
with Democrats would not run for
re-el Iction in 2012.

Lieberman, 68, was defeated
the last time he ran for the Demo-
cratic Senate nomination in Con-
necticut, in 2006, but won a new
term running as an independent in
a three-way race.
Top Democrats like Sen. Chris-
topher Dodd and President Barack
Obama who had supported Lieber-
man in the 2006 primary instead
backed Democratic nominee Ned
Lamont in the fall general elec-
tion. Lieberman was disappointed
that some old friends weren't loyal
to him.
In the years since, he aligned
himself with Democrats in the
Senate, who permitted him to
chair a committee in return. Yet
in 2008 he supported McCain,
the Republican presidential can-
didate, who put the Connecticut
lawmaker on his list of potential
vice presidential running mates.
Lieberman's decision to speak
at the 2008 GOP presidential nom-
inating convention angered Dem-
ocrats, and the speech he gave
contrasting Obama to McCain
angered them more.
"In the Senate, during the 3 1/2
years that Sen. Obama has been
a member, he has not reached
across party lines to . accomplish
anything significant, nor has he
been willing to take on powerful
interest groups in the Democratic

Party to get something done,"
Lieberman said atthe time.
Connecticut Democrats also
have criticized Lieberman's strong
support of the Iraq war, although
they were pleased when he led the
recent Senate fight to repeal the
ban on gays serving openly in the
military.
Lieberman's poll ratings in his
home state had slipped in recent
years, encouraging Democratic'
challengers and sparking specu-
lation about the senator's retire-
ment. Lieberman's colleague,
Dodd, recently retired from the
Senate.
Former Connecticut Secretary
of the State Susan Bysiewicz said
Tuesday she'll run in 2012 for
Lieberman's seat.
Two Connecticut House Dem-
ocrats, Chris Murphy and Joe
Courtney, are also considering a
run.
There had been speculation
about whether Lieberman would
run in 2012 as a Democrat, Repub-
lican or independent.
After the 2008 election and at
Obama's urging, Senate Demo-
crats decided notcto punish Lieber-
man for supporting the GOP
ticket. They voted to let him keep
his chairmanship of the Home-
land Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee.

DETROIT
Undercover police
officer killed while
chasing burglar
An undercover police offi-
cer chasing a burglary suspect
through the back yard of a sub-
urban Detroit home was shot five
times and killed with a gun stolen
from the house, authorities said
yesterday.
Larry Nehasil was hit in the
head, back, buttocks, thigh and hip
Monday evening as he and other
officers tried to arrest two men
suspected in as many as 50 area
burglaries. One suspect also was
shot to death.
Nehasil's bulletproof vest
stopped the shot to the back, but
not the others, including the fatal
shot to the head, said Undersheriff
Mike McCabe.
The 48-year-old Livonia offi-
cer was part of a surveillance
team tailing the two brothers
into Walled Lake, about 22 miles
northwest of Detroit.
COLUMBUS, Ohio
Supreme Court
justice calls for end
of death penalty
An Ohio Supreme Court justice
who helped write the state's death
penalty law three decades ago is
calling for an end to capital pun-
ishment in the state.
Justice Paul Pfeifer was one of
the leading proponents of Ohio's
death penalty law as a state legis-
lator in the 1970s and 1980s.
Pfeifer also said yesterday that
Gov. John Kasich should consider
commuting the death sentences of
all inmates condemned to die to
life without parole.
Pfeifer, a Republican, was

chairman of the Senate Criminal
Justice Committee as Ohio debat-
ed the capital punishment bill that
became law in 1981.
He says the recent decrease in
death sentences is a sign society
believes life sentences are punish-
ment enough.
LOS ANGELES
Classroom gun
accident wounds
two students
A gun in a 10th-grader's back-
pack discharged yesterday when
he dropped the bag, wounding two
students at a high school, includ-
ing one who remained in critical
condition, police said.
A 15-year-old girl with a head
wound underwent hours of sur-
gery at Los Angeles County Har-
bor-UCLA Medical Center, said
Dr. Gail V. Anderson Jr. A 15-year-
old boy was in serious condition
with neck and shoulder wounds.
Both teens were hit with the
same bullet, Los Angeles deputy
police chief Patrick Gannon said.
John Deasy, deputy superin-
tendent of the Los Angeles Uni-
fied School District, said there
was no indication the student
had touched the gun before it dis-
charged.
"He literally dropped his knap-
sack on the desk and it went off,"
Deasy said.
Gannon said the student apolo-
gized before running to another
classroom.

ers and anyone who is involved,"
Hieftje said.
In an interview after addressing

Avery, a medical marijuana pro-

strongly that the city shouldn't

"The best solution is to remove
the temptation to act as an agency
of the federal government ... by not
compiling these lists," Avery said.
When asked how he felt about

prohibits felons from opening
either dispensaries or cultivation

Renee said it is important that
the city of Ann Arbor make it pos-

event.
Coleman and other University
administrators, including the Uni-
versity's Executive Vice President
for Medical Affairs Ora Pescovitz,
the University's Vice President for
Research Stephen Forrest, Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon and the
University's Vice President and
General Counsel Suellyn Scarnec-
chia, cut the ceremonial ribbon to
commemorate the opening of the
three projects.
Pescovitz said she feels that
beyond the NCRC's large space,
the complex has "immeasurable,
infinite potential."
She echoed Coleman, saying
that innovation is essential for the
"future" of the University and for
the nation asa whole.
Forrest said despite his initial
concerns about the cost and pop-
ularity of the accelerator, it will
likely benefit the University com-
munity and state economy.
"It started out as a risky venture
but promises to be an essential
step in the (University's) prom-
ise of being the leaders and best
and encouraging and helping fac-
ulty and students and our venture
partners to start their companies
right here in Michigan," Forrest
said.
Ken Nesbit, executive director
of Tech Transfer, said one of the
goals of the business accelerator
is to help transform small startup
companies into large, powerful
companies that will hopefully stay
in the Midwest and create local job
opportunities.
Jim O'Connell, associate direc-
tor of business formation at the
Tech Transfer Center, said the
accelerator will likely focus on
technology and companies that
have some kind of link to the Uni-
versity before looking to other
companies. The accelerator space,
which can house 10 to 15 compa-
nies, has several potential tenants
waiting to become part of the cen-
ter, he said.

O'Connell added that he feels
there is an increased chance of
a company staying in Michigan
after being incubated in the Ven-
ture Accelerator.
In return for the services
offered by the University, each
business signs on for a one-year
lease and pays a leasing fee.
O'Connell said though the
cost of leasing may be higher at
the Venture Accelerator, the rate
includes many resources available
to the companies.
"This is about adding services
and values beyond what you can
get in a $5 office," O'Connell said.
Acting as a "feeder" space for
beginning businesses, O'Connell
said that after a few years, the
rate may become too expensive for
businesses that no longer need all
of the accelerator's services. The
businesses are then encouraged to
move out into their own space.
A media tour of the facilities
yesterday revealed five startup
businesses housed in the new
offices and laboratories. One of the
businesses, Life Magnetics, moved
in on Dec. 20, 2010 and is current-
ly purchasing lab equipment. The
other four businesses are expected
to move into the space in the com-
ing months.
Founded in 2009 by Brandon
McNaughton, a former University
applied physics graduate student,
Life Magnetics is developing a bio-
sensor to measure the growth of
single bacterial cells and the cells'
responses to antibiotics.
McNaughton works on the proj-
ect with Bill Wood, the project's
interim CEO, and with his previ-
ous adviser, Raoul Kopelman, a
Richard Smalley distinguished
University professor of chemistry,
physics and applied physics.
In an interview after the tour,
McNaughton said the goal of the
device is to determine the best
therapy for a patient with a bacte-
rial infection and to speed up the
process of discovery, which cur-
rently takes two or more days. The
goal for the biosensor is to com-
plete the test within one hour, he
said.

The biosensor's ability to moni-
tor individual cells could also be
applied to track the growth of can-
cer cells, McNaughton said.
He added that he believes a
clinical prototype of the biosen-
sor will be completed within two
to three years, but may be delayed
from going to market pending FDA
approval. The company currently
has five employees and hopes to
have 15 by the end of the year and
90 to 100 within the next four to
five years, McNaughton said.
Next door to Life Magnetics is
3D Biomatrix, a business creating
three-dimensional cell scaffolds
to grow and test cells.
Rachel Cuddihy, one of the com-
pany's researchers and a former
Ph.D. student at the University,
said most drug tests occur in two-
dimensional environments, which
don't mimic the human body. In a
three-dimensional scaffold, cells
act more like the human body and
can beused in the pharmaceutical
industry, Cuddihy said.
In an interview after the event,
Cuddihy said she and her col-
leagues are excited to be in the
"beautiful facilities" and in close
proximity to other emerging com-
panies..
Other businesses in the acceler-
ator include Phrixus Pharmaceuti-
cals, a clinical-development stage
company working on a drug to
treat heart failure, and Civionics, a
company designinglow-cost wire-
less sensors to measure structural
health and energy usage in build-
ings. EngXT is another business
housed in the accelerator, and has
developed an electric-field moni-
toring system that gives off signals
to monitor electrostatic stress on
electronic devices.
In an interview after the tour,
Steven Rogacki, an engineer -for
EngXT and a lead engineer in
research at the University, said the
business resources at the Venture
Accelerator are vital to the future
of the company.
"It's absolutely essential,"
Rogacki said. "I wouldn't know
how to proceed without that kind
of help."

Change intended
for Business and
Engineering
students
By ROBIN VEECK
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Student Assem-
bly unanimously approved a reso-
lution at its meeting last night
supporting a new system for Wol-
verine Access to display degree
audits and grade point averages
for students working toward dual
degrees.
Students in all cross-college
programs must currently audit
their own schedules in each col-
lege they're enrolled in. The
resolution specifically endorses
reform of Wolverine Access to
display degree audits and trans-
fers from both colleges on the
same online document for stu-
dents pursuing dual degrees in
the Ross School of Business and.
the College of Engineering.
Drafted through an MSA part-
nership with the Society of Busi-
ness Engineers, a campus group
made up of students enrolled in
both the College of Engineering
and the Ross School of Business,
the resolution states that "the lack
of appropriate grade point aver-
ages appearing on the transcript
complicates the process of, and/
or places (students) at a disadvan-
tage when applying for a job or
future studies."
The resolution originally
endorsed the reform of degree
audits on Wolverine Access for all
cross-college programs, but the
resolution's authors decided that
limiting the scope of the resolu-
tion to Business and Engineering
students would make implemen-
tation more feasible.
Interim MSA Vice President
Sean Walser said in an interview
after the meeting that the Uni-

versity of Michigan Engineering
Council recently passed a similar
resolution. Both resolutions will
now be sent to Business School
Dean Robert Dolan, Engineering
Dean David Munson, BBA Pro-
gram Director Scott Moore and
Engineering Associate Dean for
Undergraduate Education James
Holloway.
The resolution was written by
Society of Business Engineers
president Zubair Ahsan, Soci-
ety of Business Engineers vice
president Uppili Rajagopalan
and Societyv of Business Engi-
neers member Arshabh Sarda.
All three are both Business and
Engineering students. Walser
and MSA Engineering Rep. Kyle
Summers also contributed to the
resolution.
Walser said he hopes the next
step will be for the authors of
the resolution to meet with the
"appropriate people" to discuss
the implementation of dual-
degree audits on Wolverine
Access.
"We don't know how success-
ful-that will be, but it's definitely
something that I'm interested in
personally, and I know other rep-
resentatives are interested in,"
Walser said.
MSA ADDRESSES
HOUSEKEEPING ISSUES
At last night's meeting, MSA
also passed a resolution amend-
ing attendance policies. Instead
of being required to attend a
committee meeting once a week,
standing rules now allow repre-
sentatives to attend either a com-
mittee or a commission meeting.
Additionally, the power to
excuse absences was transferred
from MSA's president to MSA's
speaker.
MSA also approved Engineer-
ing junior Crissie Zuchora and
LSA senior Adriana Coleska as
new representatives, who were
appointed to fill empty seats.



SHRIVER
From Page 1A
he developed with his wife Eunice
Kennedy Shriver.
In a statement yesterday, Presi-
dent Barack Obama said Shriver
will live on as a symbol of commu-
nity service and humanitarianism
in the United States.
"I was deeply saddened to learn
about the passing of Sargent Shriv-
er, one of the brightest lights of the
greatest generation," Obama said.
"Over the course of his long and
distinguished career, Sarge came
to embody the idea of public ser-
vice."
In an interview with The Michi-
gan DailylastOctober, JudyGuskin
highlighted Shriver's strong work
ethic and dedication to the pro-
gram, noting that he inspired the
workers in the Peace Corps office
to adopt a similar attitude.
"We worked long hours," she
said. "We would stop when it got
dark, and we got too hungry so
we'd go out to eat, and then we'd
come back and look up and see
Sarge Shriver's window was still lit.
People were still working up there,
so we went back to work."
Al Guskin said in an interview
last night that the Peace Corps is
successful on such a widespread
level because of Shriver's undying
perseverance and constant positive
attitude.
"He was a great man," Guskin
said. "He was a giant, really, in
terms of what he accomplished.
The Peace Corps's success is
directly tied to his vision, his
enthusiasm, his ability to create
an organization and a structure

that would outlive him, which is
the greatest compliment you can
make of anyone who was a lead-
er."
Though Guskin said he didn't
interact with Shriver much person-
ally, he said everytime he met with
Shriver, he was awed by his dedica-
tion to the program.
"I didn't know him well, though
I met him at many occasions, both
in this country and when I was
serving in Thailand, and he was
always full of enthusiasm," Guskin
said. "He was always so positive,
particularly about the Peace Corps
volunteers."
Judy Guskin echoed her hus-
band's sentiments yesterday, saying
that it was Shriver's unwavering
optimism that allowed the Peace
Corps to flourish.
"Of all the people I met and
had an opportunity to work with,
he was the most inspiring," Judy
Guskin said. "I loved his optimism
and with his message of service he
touched the hearts of thousands of
Peace Corps volunteers."
John Greisberger, director of the
University's International Center
and a former Peace Corps volun-
teer, said Shriver was "an amazing
individual," who often expressed
his fondness for the University
community's critical role in con-
tributing to the program.
"That challenge was really
picked up by our students here at
Michigan, and what Shriver said
is that the Peace Corps would just
be another idea if it weren't for
the affirmative response of those
Michigan students and faculty,"
Greisberger said.
Since the program's founding,
almost 2,200 University gradu-

ates have participated in the Peace
Corps in more than 44 countries,
according to the University's Peace
Corps website.
Judy Guskin said she also had
the opportunity to work with
Shriver on the War on Poverty,
several years after they first col-
laborated during the Peace Corps's
inaugural venture to Thailand.
"I was lucky to work for him
both through Peace Corps when it
was set up and also the war on pov-
erty," Judy Guskin said. "It was a
great, great pleasure."
Judy Guskin said that in honor
of Shriver's hard work in develop-
ing the program, she and other
volunteers helped to develop The
Sargent Shriver Award for Distin-
guished Humanitarian Service,
which is awarded by the National
Peace Corps Association each year
to a returned volunteer who con-
tinues to work toward humanitar-
ian efforts.
"That was one of the ways we
felt as volunteers we could let him
know how much we appreciated
the inspiration he gave to all of us,"
Judy Guskin said. "He will live on
in memory, and I think I speak here
for all the volunteers who were
touched by him."
Rackham student Alex Pompe, a
former campus coordinator at the
University's Peace Corps office,
said he was constantly reminded
of Shriver and Kennedy's original
message while working for the
Peace Corps, especially during the
50th anniversary celebration of the
program this past fall.
"The loss of such an amazing
person is really felt throughout the
Peace Corps community at the Uni-
versity of Michigan," he said.

VOTING

mhan and Gonggrijp from being
deported from the country.
Halderman said he was in India
to present solutions to problems
in electronic voting machines, or
EVMs, at a conference on com-
puter security issues.
One of Halderman's colleagues,
Indian citizen Hari Prasad, was
arrested and detained by Indian
police in August for trying to
present the research. Halderman
said he believes some Indian offi-
cials may have been upset about
his research, which may be why
Prasad was arrested and why
Halderman was almost deported.
"The research showed sig-
nificant vulnerabilities in India's
voting machines which, up to
that point, Indian authorities had
been claiming were 'perfect' and
'tamper-proof,"' Halderman said.
Technology Review, a publi-
cation from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, reported
that Indian EVMs are the most
widely used voting system in
the world, with more than 400
million Indian voters using the
machines alone.
Halderman said his research
could be disliked by public offi-
cials because it reveals holes in
the Indian voting system that
would undermine the legitimacy
of their political victories. There-
fore, his EVM study could be
interpreted as a means of ques-
tioning whether the offices had
been acquired through ill means,
he said.
"If you were elected fairly, of
course finding out that the system
was-insecure might cast doubt
on your legitimacy. If you were
elected by cheating,. then obvi-
ously you don't want the system
to be improved," Halderman said.
"Now, our studies to date have not
even tried to demonstrate that
previous elections were stolen."
Published in April, the study
found that India's EVMs are "vul-
nerable to serious attacks." It says

that the systems "do not provide
transparency," soresultsfroamthe
machines can't be confirmed to
have been cast honestly.
Halderman said he hoped to
shed light on these issues while in
India. However, when he landed
in India on Dec. 12, Indian offi-
cials told Halderman to return to
the United States on the plane he
had arrived in.
"Luckily, I have a lot of experi-
ence missing planes," Halderman
said. "So I did everything I could
to try to miss that one."
Since Halderman could no lon-
ger present his research, he spent
his time with friends and visited
landmarks like the Taj Mahal.
Though he is now safely at home,
Halderman said his colleagues in
India are still in a tense and dan-
gerous situation because of their
research.
Even so, Halderman said he
plans to return to India and con-
tinue research on the country's
EVMs.
"I'm very eager to go to India
again," Halderman said. "We'll
see what happens."
He said he plans to continue his
work on India's voting systems
because most of the research in
the past has been on systems in
wealthier nations, even though
most of the world's democracies
are in poorer countries.
"We have a lot to learn about
how to make voting systems that
are secure and suitable for the
needs of countries outside of the
U.S. and Europe," Halderman
said.
Halderman and his doctor-
ate students made headlines in
October for hacking the pilot site
of an Internet voting system in
Washington, D.C., which would
have allowed overseas voters to
cast ballots in the United States's
November election, according to
an Oct. 7, 2010 Michigan Daily
article. Halderman and his stu-
dents programmed the system to
play "Hail to the Victors" after
each vote was cast - ultimately
causing administrators to shut
down the online voting system.

Keep our lakes great
Preserve funding for restoration initiatives
The Great Lakes are facing a bigger threat than the Asian
Carp invasion. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative - a
program proposed in 2009 that devotes millions of dollars
to the cleanup and preservation of one of the most environmentally
contaminated areas throughout the country -- is at risk of losing a
large chunk of its federal funding. This proposal has created a stir
among environmental activists. For Michigan, restoring the Great
Lakes will greatly benefit the environment and the economy. Con-
gress needs to ensure that funding for the Great Lakes restoration
initiative isn't cut from the 2011 budget.

Is the Pope Catholic?

According to a Jan. 16 article from MLive.
com, in 2009 the Obama administration
proposed a five-year program to cleanup
the Great Lakes. In 2010, the federal gov-
ernment allocated $475 million to the Great
Lakes Restoration Initiative. But this year
Congress is considering cutting $175 million
from the program. The program's funding
is divided among hundreds of programs in
seven states.
The Great Lakes are an extremely valuable
resource for Michigan's economy, and this
program is critical for future investments.
Cameron Davis, senior adviser to the U.S.
EPA's administrator for the Great Lakes, said
"the Great Lakes are an economic engine
for this region." According to a report by the
non-profit Brookings Institution, the project
would raise property values along the lake-
shore by $12 billion - puttingthem at $19 bil-
lion - just by cleaning the toxic sediments in
the Great Lakes region. Additionally, hunt-
ing, fishing and wildlife industries bring in
more than $4 billion in revenue for the state
of Michigan annually. Also, the industries
based on the Great Lakes could provide up to
$50 billion for the state economy in the long
term. The Great Lakes are also a main tour-
ism attraction in Michigan. If they become-
too contaminated, the state could lose that
source of revenue.
Though the economic advantages speak
for themselves, environmental issues also

need to be considered. Due to toxic sedi-
ments, the natural habitat for fish and other
wildlife has been greatly affected. Cur-
rently, there are two projects funded by the
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The first
focuses on rehabilitating Portage Creek
in Portage, MI. The second is spent on the
removal of dams in Otsego Township and
the city of Kalamazoo from the Kalamazoo
River - one of the mosthighly contaminated
waterways in Michigan. Mark Hatton, the
redevelopment project manager for the city
of Kalamazoo, said the projects will be fin-
ished in 2011 and that "there will be a huge
change seen in this area." It is imperative
that there is funding for these projects to be
completed.
While cutting programs seems to be the
simplest solution to balance the state budget,
it's only a temporary fix. Decreasing fund-
ing for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
may result in more spending in the future
due to accumulating environmental issues.
Congress needs to remember that preser-
vation of the Great Lakes is important for
the state economy and for the well-being of
Michigan residents.
The Great Lakes are undeniably important
to Michigan. They bring in revenue, provide
jobs and house a variety of wildlife. Con-
gress needs to ensure that the Great Lakes
are cared for before the damage becomes too
severe to repair.

f someone asks you a question
that you think has a very obvious
answer in the affirmative, I sug-
gest responding
with this expres-,
sion: "Is the Pope s
Catholic?" For
example, you could
use this if a friend
from another uni-
versity asks wheth-
er these past three
years have been the
worst time to be a DAR-WEI
Michigan student C E
in terms of the foot- CHEN
ball team's success.
I bring up that
expression because President Barack
Obama has recently promised to make
environmental policy a priority for the
new year. Climate scientists all across
the country are wondering why it has
taken Obama so long to recognize that
our environment needs help. Informa-
tion that is almost as obvious as the
fact that the Pope is Catholic.
Obama has been by no means igno-
rant of climate change throughout his
first two years in office. At the end
of his Democratic nomination vic-
tory speech in 2008, he said that "this
was the moment when the rise of the
oceans began to slow and our planet
began to heal." He knew years ago that
there were problems that had to be
dealt with, but it's clear that he didn't
make the environment a priority for
his first two years in office - a time
when he had Democratic majorities in
both chambers of Congress. Now that
the new, Republican-heavy House of
Representatives has been sworn in, it
seems like Obama's vision from two
years ago of healing the planet isn't
goingto come to fruition.
Some conservative readers are
probably saying: "How does a Repub-

lican-controlled House mean our
environment is screwed?" I wouldn't
be so pessimistic if the GOP at least
recognized that our planet Earth is
suffering at the hands of man-made
events. In most of the Western world,
the argument about dealing with cli-
mate change centers on questions like:
"How can we deal with it?" In Ameri-
ca, the debate is: "Does climate change
even exist?"
Let's look at Rep. John Shimkus
(R-Illinois) who spoke in 2009 before
a House subcommittee: "The planet
won't be destroyed by global warm-
ing because God promised Noah." I
wouldn't be so worried if this quote
came from some random crazy guy on
the street. But this is a United States
Congressman. And since the Republi-
cans have taken control of the House,
Shimkus is now a candidate to chair
the House Energy committee this
year. If he assumed this position, prog-
ress toward addressingclimate change
would be in seriousjeopardy.
Other conservatives that deny
global warming include Fox News
host Sean Hannity, who argues that
winter is cold and seems to be getting
colder and more extreme every year, so
global warming cannot be happening.
This theory doesn't hold a lot of water
since climate scientists have already
theorized that climate change causes
extreme weather in general, regard-
less of temperature. His statements
not only demonstrate that he doesn't
have a basic understanding of earth's
seasons, but they also imply that he
should be freaking out whenever
nighttirhe comes around because he
thinks the sun is starting to burn out.
What's even worse is that no sci-
entific body of legitimate standing in
the world has a dissenting opinion on
climate change. In 2006 the Ameri-
can Association for the Advance-

ment of Science issued the following
statement: "The scientific evidence is
clear: global climate change caused
by human activities is occurring now
and it is a growing threat to society
... The time to control greenhouse
gas emissions is now." And that's just
one example. I encourage you to look
up credible scientific organizations
and their official stances on climate
change. I guarantee that none of them
deny it.
The time to control
greenhouse gas
emissions is now.
On one side, we have politicians
from a party - many of whom are so
scientifically ignorant that they deny
evolution who think global warm-
ing is a hoax. The other side consists
of scientific organizations dedicated
to scientific research that agree action
needs to be taken urgently because
climate change is man-made. It's abso-
lutely befuddling how these two sides
are taken with the same amount of
seriousness. Republican House Speak-
er John Boehner once said, "The idea
that carbon dioxide is a carcinogen
that is harmful to our environment is

Celebrate MLK Day

"job-killing" health care law actually kills jobs.

This past Monday, we celebrated Martin
Luther King Jr. Day. The University didn't hold
classes, and there were various groups around
campus putting on events to honor and celebrate
one of the most influential leaders of the past cen-
tury. Yet some schools still had classes that day.
As a public University, we recognize MLK
Day as an official holiday. But not all schools
do. I went to Catholic schools from kindergar-
ten through 12th grade, and Jan. 17 was my
first MLK Day off. Over the weekend, I told my
roommate that this was the first time I wouldn't
be going to school on MLK Day. She went to a
public school in New Jersey and always had
MLK day off, so she was shocked to find that my
Catholic school didn't recognize the holiday.
In high school, one of my best friends was
African American. I distinctly remember our last
MLK Day a year ago, when she didn't come to
school. I texted her while I was in class to ask her
where she was and she replied, telling me "It's my
day! Of course I'm not coming to school! My mom
didn't make me." Her mother was a gym teacher
at one of the local public elementary schools, and
the public schools had the day off. As I laughed
at her response, imagining her saying this to me
with the same energy, I realized there was some
truth to what she was saying.
Our high school was mostly white students,
and I could count the number of African Amer-
ican students on my fingers. But I don't think
that should be any grounds for not celebrating
MLK Day. Catholic schools don't have to follow
the same calendar as the public schools, and
they can choose to have different days off. So
why wouldn't they choose to have MLK Day

off? Would it really be that big of an inconve-
nience to have one less day of school? They
could make up that day by getting rid of one of
the superfluous days we have off for conferenc-
es or other unimportant activities. Celebrating
a man who lived and died for civil rights seems
like abetter use of vacation days.
I'm not African American, so maybe I don't
have the best platform for this argument. But
having a best friend who is African American
has helped me to identify with her family and
culture much better. I don't see why Catholic
schools wouldn't want to celebrate this day.
And I'm not just saying that they should give
kids the day off because they don't want to go
to school. That's not the reason. out of respect,
Catholic schools should recognize this day and
fall in line with the public schools that already
view MLK Day as a holiday.
Catholic schools that do not give students
MLK Day off certainly aren't racist. I can clearly
remember being taught about Martin Luther
King Jr. and the important role he played in the
civil rights movement. I remember doing activi-
ties in elementary school to celebrate MLK Day
in class. Obviously Catholic schools recognize
this important man inother ways. But since pri-
vate Catholic schools have the power to make
their own schedules, they should elect not to
have school on Martin Luther King Jr. Day - not
just so kids don't have to go to school that day,
but as a sign of respect and acceptance of Afri-
can American students across the nation.

Test drive your class

t the start of every semester at
the University, students enjoy
he great tradition of syllabus
week. The time is marked by short-
ened lectures, can-
celled discussion
sections and the
only time outside of
exams that almost
every student will
attend class. While
this process is a
decent way to start
the semester, the
three weeks fol- JEFF
lowing syllabus WOJCIK
week should be
quite the opposite.
Currently, I'm
taking two different courses, either of
which will complete my distribution
requirements and allow me to gradu-
ate in April. One is a natural science
course about the environment, and
the other is a philosophy class about
symbolic analysis. While both cours-
es are interesting, taught well and
will help me in life after I leave the
University, I'm not sure which course
to take because I cannot tell how I'll
do on the exams and papers. The good
news is that both have assignments
due this week that I can use to gauge
how I'll fare during finals, and I can
use the drop/add period to evaluate
the course work that will ultimately
evaluate me. Unfortunately, many
courses don't provide similar feed-
back to students to determine their
ability to succeed.
The drop/add deadline at the Uni-
versity is 20 days after the first day
of classes. This deadline is designed
to afford students a period of time to
better understand the content of their
courses, determine their ability to
interact with the professor and assess
how much they'll likely learn. Dur-
ing this time, students-should receive

some feedback about their ability to
perform throughout the semester.
Instructors can accomplish .this with
small - even non-graded - assign-
ments that students can complete in
the first three weeks of the semester.
These assignments could be respons-
es to prompts that might appear on a
midterm, math problemsets, or abbre-
viated versions of larger assignments.
These tasks should only take a small
portion of students' time, but provide
at least some basic ideaof how the stu-
dent will perform in the class.
I'm not suggesting that students
should be allowed to game the system
by taking only courses in which they
will find success. However, I think
students should be given a solid idea
and expectation of what is neces-
sary for them to perform well in each
course they take. This is good for stu-
dents because they will have a real-
istic understanding of their capacity
to succeed in the course, and - ide-
ally - more courses will evaluate stu-
dents on more than just a few exams
or papers.
There are a few ways to increase
the amount of relevant feedback stu-
dents receive in time to impact their
decision to select courses. First, the
College of Literature, Science and the
Arts must take action to ensure that
all new courses provide students with
some grade or other feedback early in
the class. The LSA Curriculum Com-
mittee - the body that recommends
which courses should be offered in
future semesters - should have a
policy to only approve courses which
include basic assignments in the first
few weeks that are included on the
course syllabus. This policy doesn't
need to be a specific requirement for
course approval, but those who serve
on the committee should only recom-
mend courses that include work for
students to complete within the first

20 days.
Beyond LSA making an effort to
welcome new courses that provide
students with timely and relevant
feedback, students should recognize
instructors who help them determine
if courses are a good fit. LSA Student
Government should provide awards
and recognition for instructors who
provide feedback to students to use in
making course selections. In recog-
nizing instructors who serve students
in this way, their methods should be a
resource for instructors in all depart-
ments. This resource will list the
leading practices in LSA for providing
graded and non-graded work to stu-
dents within the drop/add period.
Some instructors use the first

idea of the best
classes to take.

ABC's 'Off the Map'
is lost in the jungle

COuRTESY OF NBC
"God bless us, every one!"
'30 Rock' steady

By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily TV/New Media Editor
You know what prime time tele-
vision needs? A medical drama!

ic to escape the demons of their
pasts.

interested in learning it) and one

Fey and friends keep
the laughs coming
during fifth season
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Magazine Editor
Not many shows last five sea-
sons. Even more rarely do shows
have original stories and main-
tain a consistent
level of humor
for so long. "30
Rock" has done 30 Rock
all that and more
with a fifth sea- Season Five
son that has been Midseason
just as engaging
as its first four. Thursdays
Liz Lemon at10 p.m.
(Tina Fey) still NBC
makes up for
the deficiencies in her social
life by kicking ass at work. Jack
Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is still
the conservative business mogul.
Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski)
and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Mor-
gan) are still self-absorbed stars
who make Liz's life as difficult
as possible. But after five years of

hijinks, chaos and last-minute tri-
umphs, the writers of "30 Rock"
had to let their characters grow
up.
The fifth season marks the lon-
gest relationships Liz, Jack and
Jenna have had during the series.
Liz has seemingly found a match
for her neuroses in her pilot boy-
friend Carol (Matt Damon, "True
Grit"), who she has been seeing
since the fourth season finale.
Jenna's relationship with the
transvestite Jenna impersonator
Paul (Will Forte, "SNL") reached
the coveted' six-month mark
before seemingly dissolving. And
in almost a year of infrequent
appearances and mentions, Jack's
fiancee Avery (Elizabeth Banks,
"Zack and Miri Make a Porno")
has evolved into more of a billed
character and has started inter-
acting with the rest of the "TGS"
staff where she belongs. While
past seasons indicate guest star
spots generally don't last long,
Carol, Paul and Avery indicate
more stability.
Though the characters are get-
ting more mature, that doesn't
mean "30 Rock" has stopped tak-
ing risks. In fact, the show did

the unthinkable this season with
a live episode filmed in "SNL" 's
Studio 8H. The feat was executed
perfectly, with Julia Louis-Drey-
fus playing flashback-Liz and fake
commercials that featured Dr.
Spaceman (Chris Parnell, "SNL")
and Drew Baird (Jon Hamm,
"Mad Men"). Separate tapings for
the East and West Coasts tailored
the show to different audiences
and offered an alternative view-
ing experience. The episode was
a gimmick and an experiment,
but overall it was a tribute to the
thrills of live television.
Still, "30 Rock" is somewhat
reliant on its guest characters.
The live episode alone utilized
the talents of Matt Damon, Rachel
Dratch, Bill Hader, Jon Hamm,
Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Chris
Parnell. In other episodes, Queen
Latifah ("The Dilemma") will
surely reappear before the end of
the season. Paul Giamatti ("John
Adams") gave a non-noteworthy
performance as a "TGS" edi-
tor and Alan Alda ("M*A*S*H")
returned as Jack's father. While

From punk to parental

Social Distortion
tones it down for
'Hard Times'
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
DailyArts Writer
Social Distortion has come a
long way since the '80s: For the
band, it was a decade of clatter-
ing symbols,
coarse vocals
and bold gui-
tars. The pace SO l
was fast and the
lyrics pumped iStoftion
with angst, Hard Times and
as it spoke ofN
"bruised and Nursery Rhymes
bloodied flesh" Epitaph
and not caring
how worried "Mommy" was about
the singer's alcohol consumption.
In other words, it was a decade of
punk rock, and that rawness runs
through albums like Mommy's
Little Monster and Prison Bound.
Social Distortion was energetic,
passionate and drenched in youth-
ful defiance, embracing the South-
ern California punk genre with
every shout and symbol crash.
With the release of its latest
album Hard Times and Nursery

Rhymes decades later, though, it's
clear the band has undergone a
transformation. In this work, it has
replaced the rapid percussion and
musical chaos with softer melodies
and singing, revealing a more laid-
back, grown-up sound. Though the
album starts with a track reminis-
cent of the old Social Distortion
vibe - featuring a typically aggres-
sive guitar part and a quick tempo
- the rest of the songs embrace a
new, mellow spirit seldom heard
from the band before.
This gentler tone emerges right
away in the second track, "Cali-
fornia (Hustle and Flow)," with
a pleasant mixture of slow per-
cussion, understated guitars and
choir-style vocals cooing in the
background. The song basks in a
calm and easy West Coast vibe -
one not even broken by the guitar
solo erupting halfway through.
The part is neatly woven into the
rest of the instrumentals, diver-
sifying the song without sound-
ing sloppy and out of place. It's a
track that any middle-aged man
could comfortably listen to in his
car, cruising with windows rolled
down as his rebellious teenage son
rolls his eyes.
"Diamond in the Rough" cap-
tures a similar easy-spirited tone.
The instruments sway together in

the breezy track, complete with
harmonizing vocals and a light
melody. It may not be pulsing with
excitement, but the song is a pleas-
ant listen, relaxed and carefree
like a California summer.
After a few tracks, however,
this mellow sound proves to be too
much of a good thing. It's difficult
to tell songs like "Bakersfield" and
"Writing on the Wall" apart from
one another - the seamless way
they flow together loses its relax-
ing appeal and instead borders on
boring. Nothing sets these songs
apart from the earlier ones in the
album: they move with equally
gentle beats, sluggish guitar parts
and nostalgic lyrics. As the vocal-
ist Mike Ness moans about being
stranded in Bakersfield with-
out his true love, it's easy to feel
stranded right there with him in
the song's repetitive nature.
Hard Times and NurseryRhymes
isn't totally barren of excitement,
as the band's edgier roots can still
be traced in tracks like "Machine
Gun Blues." Here, the guitar part
is stronger and tinged with atti-
tude, unlike its passive role in
other songs.
"Can't Take It With You" also
features more assertive instru-
mentals, and the strings wail along
with the choir and piano through-

MAP
From Page 5A
Tommy's problem is that he is
gifted and privileged, but spent
too much time partying, and we're
supposed to feel sorry for him and
see that he's not so different from
the culturally estranged invalid
before him. The misguided mono-
logue does manage to tie things
back together, though, when
Tommy says "I lost my family
because I was proud. I don't want
you to do the samething."
What stands out about the
show's pilot isn't characters, plot
(there was a plot?) or even the
beautiful locale - It's definitely
the blood. Dramas are always
more graphic than other shows,
and for good reason, but "Off the
Map" is just gratuitous. Within a
single hour, the doctors encoun-
ter a man who's been stung in the
ankle by a stingray, and another

whose arm is caught on a zip line.
He later suffers internal bleeding,
which is externally disgusting.
The lack of access to equipment
and technology means that things
can get pretty gross pretty quick,
but viewers can only be expected
to stomach so much, especially in
a pilot episode.
"Off the Map" isn't bad; it's just
more mediocre than memorable.
After watching one episode, it's
hard to even remember the char-
acters' names. If there's one thing
to be learned from the exorbitant
number of medical dramas on TV,
it's that character is of paramount
importance. Shows like "House,"
"Scrubs" and "Grey's Anatomy"
haven't survived on scenery and
spraying blood: They've survived
becausethe audience cares enough
about the characters to turn on
the TV each week and follow their
story. If "Off the Map" focuses
more on the story of what's-her-
name than on the gore, there might
be areason to keep watching. -

out the track. The song's style is
shaded with the blues, and though
it's starkly different from Social
Distortion's past punk sound, it
breaks up the monotony of the
other tracks.
For early Social Distortion fans,
Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes
may come as a shock. It's soft, slow
and even features the soulful voic-
es of a background choir - strik-
ingly different from their former
grittiness. Nothing about the
album inspires listeners to get tat-
toos or start bar fights, but instead
it encourages them to lay on a
beach and reminisce. This musical
metamorphosis may be upsetting
to those clad in denim and ragged
flannel shirts, but to others, it's a
welcome change. After all, some-
times it's just time to grow up.


ROCK
From Page 5A
becomes a one-note "look, it's
Alan Alda." It has always been
this way, but with the matura-
tion of the characters, the writ-
ers should look to better use their
guest stars.
There's a lot of uncertainty fac-
ing the second half of the fifth
season. Here's hoping Liz and

Carol last, because it's about time
Liz Lemon found a decent man.
Who knows if Jack will actually
go through with this marriage
(let's not forget, he's been engaged
twice before), but it certainly feels
like a possibility. Rumors are cir-
culating that the show's sixth
season may be its last due to the
retirement of Alec Baldwin. But
among the questions, there is no
doubt "30 Rock" will continue
with just as much humor and tal-
ent as it always has.

But throughout the coaching
search after the firing of Rodri-
guez, who is known as a pioneer of
the spread-option offense, Bran-
don said it was important that the
schemes maximized the players'
talents and strengths.
The Wolverines return depth on
the defensive line with defensive
linemen Mike Martin, Ryan Van
Bergen and Craig Roh. And the
secondary should improve, with
younger players taking their lumps
in 2010.
Hoke answered critics of the
3-3-5 defense during his press
conference and sounded a lot like
Rodriguez did when the former
Michigan coach was questioned
about his defensive scheme - they
both preached its flexibility.
"You can talk about the 3-3-5,
you can talk about a 4-3, you can
talk about a 3-4, you can go back
and play a 6-2," Hoke said last
week. "I mean, people need to be
educated on what (the 3-3-5) is,
because there's multiple ways to
play that with depending on the
personnel that you want to have on
the field.
"We played with four guys on
the line of scrimmage, five guys on
the line of scrimmage, three guys
on the line of scrimmage. It just
depends. It's flexibility thatit gives
you, is something that was good
for us."
Mattison hasn't had any short-
age of high-profile coaching
experience. He won a National
Championship during a three-year
stint as co-defensive coordinator
at Florida, he coached for eight
seasons in South Bend - serving
in various defensive capacities for

Notre Dame - and he also spent
time at Texas A&M and Navy.
Now, with more than 30 years
of coaching experience, Matti-
son returns to Ann Arbor with a
tall task - to help Hoke restore
the respectability of Michigan's
defense.
"We will miss him because he's
a great coach, but also an even bet-
ter person," said Baltimore Ravens
coach John Harbaugh. "The stu-
dents there are the lucky ones. Not
only will he teach them football
to the highest level, he will influ-
ence them to be the best persons
they canbe. Greg is one of the good
people you are fortunate to meet
in your life. We are disappointed
that he will not be coaching our
defense, but we know thathe is fol-
lowing a true love by returning to
the Wolverines."
MEET THE STAFF: Along with
Mattison, Michigan announced
the hiring of six new staff mem-
bers and the re-hiring of another.
Fred Jackson, who has coached
Michigan's running backs for the
past 19 seasons, will be back for his
20th.
Hoke brought six members of
his San Diego State staff with him
to Ann Arbor, including his offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges, who
will serve that role and work with
the quarterbacks.
The Aztecs' offense was just
seven spots lower than Michigan's
as far as offensive yardage output
- and they scored more points
than the Wolverines.
And Borges previously served
as Auburn's offensive coordina-
tor from 2004-2007, guiding the
Tigers to a 13-0 record in 2004
with running backs Cadillac Wil-
liams and Ronnie Brown and
quarterback Jason Campbell at his

disposal on offense.
Additionally, Dan Ferrigno
(special teams/tight ends), Darrell
Funk (offensive line), Jeff Hecklin-
ski (wide receivers), Mark Smith
(linebackers) and Aaron Wellman
(strength and conditioning) will
come to Michigan after spending
both seasons at San Diego State
with Hoke.

"We have hired some great foot-
ball coaches who will represent
the University and Michigan foot-
ball with great pride and respect
for the tradition of this program,"
Hoke said.
"They are great teachers and
mentors for young men and will
work -hard to help our players
reach their goals."

Senior Ben Baldus-Strauss helped Michigan to a national title in 2010.

Baldus-Strauss perseveres
through injuries for Blue

By MATT SPELICH
For the Daily
Ben Baldus-Strauss, as a gym-
nast at Michigan, sustained five
career-interrupting injuries in the
past three years including multi-
ple stress fractures - a broken left
ankle, a torn MCL and a broken
thumb, which he sustained mid-
skill at the NCAA Championships
last year. But even with the break,
he managed to not only finish the
routine, but he also won the round.
It was later revealed that Bal-
dus-Strauss's contribution had
put the Wolverines just over the
top to win their first NCAA title in
11 years. He celebrated that night
with his arm in a sling - some-
thing he was all too used to as "the
comeback kid."
And to think, Baldus-Strauss
almost gave it all up after an ankle
displacement he suffered at the
NCAA Preliminaries his freshman
year.
"I was seriously questioning
whether or not I was going to be
able to come back," Baldus-Strauss
said. "My parents advised me to
consider quitting the team ... but
I just couldn't let it go, I couldn't
leave my teammates, so I just
pushed through it."
"Pushing through it," meant
surgery a week later, crutches, and
a walking boot for 12 weeks before
Baldus-Strauss was able to begin
physical therapy to prepare for the
next season. On top of that, he con-
tinued to attend every practice in
support of his teammates.
His recovery was not devoid
of problems though. He ended up

In fact, it'd be hard to find a Wol-

we just didn't do that," junior Stu
Douglass said after the game. "I
think we might have been think-
ing too much about switches and
getting overworked a little bit men-
tally more than anything. And we
were just in a scramble a little bit,
too much."
With Shurna's hot hand (he fin-
ished with 24 points), Michigan
(1-5 Big Ten, 11-8 overall) struggled
to find an offensive rhythm early
in the game. Sophomore guard
Darius Morris spent more time on
the bench than on the floor in the
first half due to foul trouble, which
meant Douglass ran the point for
the Wolverines.
But with the team's floor gen-
eral out, Michigan's offensive game
flattened - findingjust eight assists
the entire game. The Wildcats
passed the ball with a military-like

precision, picking up 18 assists and
turningthe ball over just five times.
The Wolverines' first-half strug-
gles carried over to after the break,
with Northwestern (3-4, 12-5)
stretching its 13-point halftime
lead into a 20-point cushion before
Michigan cut the final margin to14
points.
The Wolverines tried to rally late
in the second half, moving into an
aggressive man-to-man defense.
But it was to no avail, as the Wol-
verines had dug themselves in too
deep a hole with their poor shoot-
ing.
Douglass led Michigan with 17
points and was the only Wolver-
ine to shoot better than 50 percent
from the floor. Morris, who played
more in the second half, racked up
16 points and was the only other
Wolverine to score in double digits.
"That's just tough to overcome
especially against a team like that,

that's as good offensively as they
are - you know they're gonna
score," Novak said after the game.
"You do your best and try to stop
them. We had a good gameplan,
tried to execute it as well as we
could but we were gonna have
to make shots and we didn't. We
didn't make enough."
The loss is Michigan's fifth
straight, but the team is sticking
to its positive thinking and focus-
ing on its next game against No. 15
Minnesota at Crisler Arena on Sat-
urday.
"We just have to keep getting
better - that's all you can say,"
Michigan coach John Beilein said.
"You don't worry about that stuff
you just say, 'Hey, it's another day,
another practice. Forget about it.
I don't care if we lost 10 in a row,
forget about it. It's the next day, it's
the nextgame, that's what's impor-
tant."

EVANSTON - It was around
the three-minute mark of the
Wolverines' 74-60 loss to North-
western when Michigan men's
basketball center Jordan Morgan
missed a wide-open dunk.
Everyone at Welsh-Ryan Arena
looked. on as Michigan's only
starting post player couldn't put
home the high-percentage shot.
Morgan has made plenty of
dunks this season, but this time,
the ball hit the back of the rim and
it popped out. Whether it was an
anomaly or not, it was representa-
tive of Michigan's struggles in the
paint all night long and through-
out much of the Big Ten season.
Dunking was the least of Mor-
gan'sproblems Tuesdaynight,but
his miss revealed that the team is
vulnerable and inexperienced in
the paint.
Throughout the evening, the
Wolverines played Morgan,
freshmen Jon Horford and Colton
Christian and redshirt freshman
Blake McLimans in the post, and
all four players had trouble in the
paint.
The four combined for just
seven points and 12 rebounds.
Northwestern completely shut
down the Wolverine big men any
time they even attempted to make
a move in the post. And when a
Michigan post player did get a
shot off, he often couldn't finish.
"I can't explain it," Michigan
guard Zack Novak said after the
game. "We put a lot of time into
that kind of stuff, working on
different types of finishes. Some
nights it just doesn't fall."
Michigan has known all sea-
son that its post players are young

The Wolverines tried dif-
ferent man-to-man matchups,
double-teaming him and even
attempted to leave him open -
no matter the circumstances,
Mirkovic scored.
"I'd like to know
his birthday ...
(he's) older than
our big guys."
"I'd like to know how many
games he's played in the post in
his life," Michigan coach John
Beilein said. "I'd like to know
his birthday, because he's prob-
ably three or four years older
than our big guys. He's played in
Europe, he's played against all
the best post players. I'm not say-
ing he's too old - I'm saying he's
really experienced ... I don't know
where he's played, but he gives
them a great dimension."
Like Michigan's offense,
Northwestern's offense focus-
es a lot on perimeter shooting.
Thus, the 6-foot-11, 248-pound
Serbia native is normally the
Wildcats' only designated post
player. But even with such atten-
tion, Mirkovic continued to back
down any Wolverine that had to
defend him.
"You can't double him because
he's a really good passer," Beilein
said of Mirkovic. "Then they'll get
a three instead of a two."

THE REALITY OF POVERTY
H CO KARU ER REEVEC
A.Y CAROLYN KLARECKI

grew up safe and sound in a middle
class bubble. I wouldn't say I was
privileged - my parents worked
very hard and sacrificed a lot to give
our family what we had. Still, I didn't
have a job until late in high school,
and my upbringing didn't prepare
me for the culture shock that would
ensue from the working experience.
In high school, I worked for a Mich-
igan State Housing and Development
agencythat provides rental assistance
for low-income families. Families
from all over Michigan would send
their applications to our office where
we processed them and determined
how much of the state's rental subsidy
would be sent their way. On paper, the
job looked really good. There were
no public bathrooms to be mopped
or vats of french fries to be cooked; it
was just a less than tumultuous desk
job. I filed paperwork, sorted the mail
and fixed the copy machine in a quiet,

air-conditioned building. What made
it miserable though, was the constant
ringing of phones. This is were I got a
harsh dose of the low-income reality.
I talked to homeless men and
women, who had to collect change
just to make the call on pay phones;
single moms, who were only a few
years older than me with four or five
kids; elderly men and women, who
were days away from eviction; and
crack and meth addicts. Some callers
had lost all hope and would unabash-
edly sob into the phone while I sat
frozen on the other end. Some were
angry and didn't know what else to do
but yell. I wasn't ready for any of this.
I was just a teenage girl with absolute-
ly no power, but they thought I could
change their living conditions.
Before this job, I thought I cared
a lot about the world. I volunteered

cians and newspapers. I was living

that a simple "thank you" or "God

as a powerful reminder that many
people hadn't given up yet.
As much as I hated my job, I hated
myself more for building a numb, pes-

job, I have gained so much respect
for the altruistic people who join the
Peace Corps, volunteer with disaster
relief efforts and dive headfirst into

to forget my trying summer.
And yet for some reason, when

returned to that office, sat behind the
desk, took a deep breath and answered

"If we're going to remain an effec-

will - then we really have to take
leadership in this and not just be sort
of passive learners about how more
advanced universities dothis," Forrest
said. "We have to show the way."
And while the University may be
on the forefront of rethinking the
traditional research model, Coleman,
Hanlon and Forrest all stressed that
m'iking such a move requires endorse-
ment from faculty members and that a
change would not be pushed from the
central administration.
Hanlon stressed that it's not the
administration's place to dictate
research topics.
"We obviously can't tell people they
have to go work on this problem," he
s2id.
Coleman also emphasized that she
doesn't want the administration to
centralize research by trying to man-
date what research faculty members
should do, though she added cluster-
ing research could be beneficial to all
University parties.
"We never want to be in a position
where we are dictating to the faculty,"
Coleman said, "but this is an opportu-
nity that we shouldn't ignore."

the various agencies in Washington ers to develop better methods of detec-

tion for bacteria and algal blooms in
the Great Lakes - both of which have
numerous harmful effects.
The research is just one of many
efforts underway to figure out how to
revitalize the Great Lakes - a problem
that requires several different research
fields to tackle effectively. The diversity
of researchers' expertise is something
Hanlon calls essential.
"In (this) example, there were
approximately 10 technical problems
that, if they could be solved, would
really have a big impact in magnifying
the effect of all the investment that's
being made by the federal government
and the state," Hanlon said of the Great
Lakes research.
"Some of these are biological prob-
lems like the biology of Ecoli, some of
them are policy problems, some are
economic problems," he continued.
"They're intertwined problems. They
aren't sort of sitting by themselves."
But for as far as the work on the Great
Lakes has come - with funding already
rolling in from the federal government
and a private donor interested in the
project - Hanlon seems to want more.
"Right now, I'm sure we have
researchers that arelooking at Ecolijust
on their own, but what we haven't tried
to do is sort of simultaneously address
these problems which are interrelated
problems and often problems that can't
be solved with a single area of exper-
tise," Hanlon said.

Coleman agrees, saying she has
confidence that the clustered research
method can be well utilized in the work
being done around sustainability and
the Great Lakes.
"I think that one of the opportuni-
ties that we have at Michigan, because
we are so big and we do research in
'so many areas, is that we have the
opportunity to tackle some really big
problems, and the Great Lakes is a big
problem," she said. "I have every confi-
dence that (our researchers) can make
great strides to solving some of the
pollution issues and the threats to the
Great Lakes."
Forrest agrees with Coleman's
assertion.
"Obviously a pressing issue in
today's world, making the footprint
left by humans less noticeable is one
issue researchers at the University -
in nearly all disciplines - are working
toward," Forrest said.
However, Forrest counters his sup-
port with a caveat that at the end of the
day, the faculty will determine what
results materialize.
"Really good scholars who are able
to communicate theirscholarship at all
levels, are really the prize of research
universities," he said. "By those people
learning and doing and teaching simul-
taneously, the students get engaged in
this and, when they leave, they have
not a static concept of the world, buta
living concept of the world."

random student intmerv iew byjordan rachelsan

Welcome to the Random
Student Interview,
where the line between
journalistic integrity and person-
al boundaries becomes blurred.
Hello there! What is your name?
Paige
What year are you, Paige?
I'm a sophomore.
And where are you from?
Charlottesville, Virginia
Charlottesville, Virginia!? What
brings you up to blustery Ann
Arbor?
My dad is from Michigan. I have
family here.
And what are you studying at this
university?
History and Political Science
Oh, cool. Are you a feminist?
Uh, I am not.
OK, because you have a nose ring,
and sometimes if you see a girl
with a nose ring and they study
political science, it means they are
a feminist. Do you think that's a
fair stereotype?
Sure, if you'd like to say that.
And how do you like your studies
so far?

I like them. It's been nice.
What has been your favorite
class?
Hmm ... that's a tough one. I always
liked Poli Sci. I really liked my pro-
fessor.
Was he good looking?
I always hit on him, but he's an old
man.
So you like old guys?
Yeah,I just like old guys.
OK then, I guess I'm striking out.
Did you vote in the past Michigan
Student Assembly election?
I did.
You did?
I did.
I don't believe you.
I did! Don't ask me who I voted for.
That's a different question.
Who did you vote for?
I don't remember.
Did your party win?
No, I don't know.
So you put a lot of thought into
your decision.
Yeah, obviously.
If you could pick your next MSA
president, would you want him or
her to beas controversial as Chris
Armstrong?
I mean, yeah. I think it's interesting
so why not?
Do you think it detracts from his
ability to govern?
No, I don't think so.
If you could change one major
thing about this university, what
would it be?
One thing?
Yes. Nude Tuesdays perhaps?
I've proposed that a few times to
University President Mary Sue
Coleman.
Hmm ... that's a good idea!

Nude Tuesdays?
-Yeah!
Do you think most people would
be unwilling to adhere to that?
Yeah, probably. There are a lot of
uptight people at this school.
Are you aware that Facebook...
Do you know what Facebook is?
No, what is that?
(awkward silence)
You don't know what Facebook is?
No.
It's a social networking system.
Oh, OK. Yeah I think I've heard of
that.
Are you aware that Facebook can
now take your phone number and
give it out to companies?
No, I was not aware of that.
How does that make you feel?
That's kind of uncomfortable.
Why does that make you uncom-
fortable?
Because I don't want random people
having my phone number.
Right, can I have your phone num-
ber?
No.
OK, fair. That was a trick question,
good job. Do you think businesses
should be entitled to look at your
pictures and hire you based on
what they see?
Well, I don't have any of those pic-
tures on Facebook.
Not a single one?
Nah ... definitely not.
If you could go on a date with one
of the following, who would it be:
Justin Bieber, Joe Jonas or a mem-
ber of Hanson?
Definitely Justin Bieber.
You're aware that he is not 18?
Yeah, I know. You didn't say we were
hooking up on the date. But yeah, def-

initely him. I like his music.
How many Justin Bieber albums
do you have on your iPod?
I believe there is only one.
And do you have it?
Yes.
So you have 100 percent of his
music?
Yes.
Why not the other two? Why not
Joe Jonas?
Which one is that?
He's the attractive one.
Oh, I don't know. I'd like to go out
with all of them. That sounds fun.
Have you had any New Year's reso-
lutions recently?
No, I didn't make any!
Maybe your New Year's resolution
should be to be less conceited.
You're so right. I'm going to work on
that.
How do you feel about all the new
stores that are going up on Main
street? 7-Eleven, Five Guys ...
Bust a nut on 7-Eleven and on Five
Guys.
Bust a nut?
Yeah, I'm so excited.
I really hope they let me print that.
That'd be terrific. What if they put
up a McDonald's, you'd be OK with
that?
Are you kidding? The golden arch is
beautiful!
So a 7-Eleven and Five Guys. Do
you think they are catering to a
certain type of people?
Like me? Definitely. .
Anything to say to the student
body at large?
1016 is where its at.
I'm not going to ask you what that
means.
Perfect.

Responsibilities.
Two years ago, Page served as a moderator for the MSA presi-
dential debate. As a faculty member at the University, Page has
continued to follow the trends and variations of student activism
on campus, especially the ebb and flow of issues that spark the
interests of undergraduate students.
One of the key differences in activism on campus since he was
an undergraduate student, Page observed, is the decline in the
number of political rallies held on campus, which were prevalent
during the Reagan administration.
Page said there was a "slightly stronger sense of activism" 25
years ago but students are still getting involved in hot-button
issues like the environment, education and fundraising for disas-
ter relief efforts.
"I don't think that we had the tools at the time ... to do the sort
of things that students do now," Page said. "So in some ways it's
more impressive what happens now."
Page's tenure as president also marked the beginning of the
University's first major capital campaign to raise funds and the
start of student-organized campaigns for emergency phones
around campus.
With help from the Women's Issues Committee and other stu-
dent groups, MSA helped organize a sit-in in the office of the Vice
President for Student Affairs to advocate for the installation of
security phones around campus, which are still in place today.
"I deserve absolutely zero credit for that, but the people in the
government that took ownership on that issue did an amazing job
and pushed that through," Page said.
Matt Nolan, a 29-year-old Bay City, Mich., resident, served as
MSA president from 2001to2002. He strove to increase the level
of professionalism of the assembly, which he said consequently
made MSA more effective.
MSA President Ron Elias's speech at the University's New Stu-
dent Convocation in 1999 influenced Nolan's decision to become
involved with the assembly.
"I became convinced that, while MSA is not always success-
ful at achieving positive change on campus, it's definitely a place
where that's possible," Nolan said. "I dove in with both feet right
off the bat."
Nolan was first elected as a representative in the fall 1999
election and later served as the external relations committee
vice chair and communications committee chair. He was re-
elected to the assembly in fall 2000, and in March, he was elected
MSA President.
Nolan said he and then-MSA Vice President Jessica Cash
focused on "fixing and upgrading" the work of the assembly.
"It was something that I think varies year to year from admin-
istration to administration a lot," Nolan said. "I think it has a
huge impact on the ability of MSA to get anything done."
Some of the changes made by the MSA administration during
Nolan's presidency included setting deadlines for when resolu-
tions needed to be presented to the assembly in order to make
it on the agenda and implementing stricter
enforcement of Robert's Rules of Order.
"It made people realize that if you were
going to come and try to do something"
in MSA, that we were going to make sure
that you took it seriously, and by doing that,
we were able to ... focus more on doing the

1976
A t a University with a rich academic and athletic history,
1976 was a momentnus year. Michigan's fontball team
had a 10-2 season, placed first in the conference and went
to the Rose Bowl. While it may be remembered for its infamous
football season, few may remember that the year alsomarked the
establishment of the Michigan Student Assembly.
MSA is one of several names that have been adopted by the
University's central student government, but its establishment
signified a new era of student government and an opportunity
to resolve the shortcomings of the preceding student governing
body, the Student Government Association.
Since 1906, the University has relied on a student governing
organization to act as a leading force for student representation.
Throughout the last century, student government presidents
have tackled campus issues like affirmative action and the cre-
ation of a fall study break. More recently, MSA has advocated for
an open housing in University residence halls, which would allow
students to live with a student of a different gender, and it has
aimed to bolster student relations with the assembly.
After Donald House unexpectedly inherited the position of
first MSA president in 1976, he soon realized that creating a new
and effective student government was not a task that would be
easily accomplished.
House, now 57 and a resident of Chelsea, Mich., became
involved with SGA when he took the position of SGA treasurer
during his first year of graduate school at the University. Accord-
ing to House, he was looking for a way to become involved on
campus after managing the student radio station at Vanderbilt
University, where he had received his undergraduate degree.
After a lawsuit involvingthe SGA president and vice president,
student government members decided to remove both officials
from their executive positions. This made the treasurer next in
line for the presidency.
"I was in shock because I got the notice under my dorm room
door that the president and vice president had been removed
from office," House said. "I (had seen) myself as an accountant or
business manager, clearly not a politician."

The first matter House faced as MSA president dealt with a
referendum from the fall of 1975 that proposed changing the
name Student Government Association to the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly. House said he wasn't prepared for the immediate
name change or the overhaul of student government positions
and regulations that he thought would occur at the end of the
school year in response to the lawsuit.
"I think we naively assumed that we had several months to put
it together and get it set up," he said.
As the new MSA president, House had a lot of work to do to
establish a stable student government, given SGA's history of law-
suits and proceedings that were debilitating to the organization.
SGA left little foundation for MSA to build off, and House's
main goal was to create a new structure for student government,
which included drafting a new constitution and compiled code.
"At the first meeting ... everybody recognized that we didn't
have a constitution, we didn't have compiled code ... we just had
Robert's Rules of Order," House said, referring to a reference
guide on parliamentary procedure. "I think that was the big-
gest issue that we dealt with the first couple weeks, just so that
we would know what the rules were and how we were going to
work."
According to House, the preceding SGA administration spent
an unnecessary amount of time arguing over and dealing with
inconsequential matters. Members of the newly-founded MSA
sought to remedy these practices by using time more effectively.
The members also decided to appoint representatives from each
of the University's colleges to serve in the governing body.
"Having a representative from (every) school or college gov-
ernment changed the mix of who was in the assembly room at
any given time, compared to SGA," House said. "They came with
a bit more sense of responsibility."
Despite his success, about two or three weeks after settling
into his position as president, House decided to resume his posi-
tion as treasurer.
"I learned that I didn't want to go into politics. That was clear
to me probably even before I (became) president," House said.

In the final MSA officer's report of December 1976, House was
called "an unsung, apolitical hero whose efforts (were) greatly
appreciated."
After House stepped down, the assembly voted on the next
president.
Exercising a Voice
Throughout the last four decades, MSA has remained an
essential means for students to bridge the gap between the stu-
dent body and the administration.
Scott Page, the University's Director of the Center for the
Study of Complex Systems and professor of complex systems,
political science and economics, served as MSA president begin-
ning in the fall of 1984.
At the time of his presidency, one of the most controversial
issues on campus was the Code of Non-Academic Conduct pro-
posed by the University. According to Page, the code outlined
rules for what students were allowed to do outside the classroom
and also formed boards of University students to determine the
guilt and innocence of student crimes.
"Most of the students were vehemently against this, so the
main reason to (run for president) was ... to stop the code," Page
said.
Though the administration did not successfully pass the code
while Page was MSA president due to veto power reserved for
the student government, there was concern among MSA mem-
bers that the University would find a back-door way to approve
the code.
"We had to make the University feel that the students were not
going to accept this," Page said. "I think we did an OK job of this."
Despite the efforts of Page and other students, the University
implemented the code inthe late
1980s, after Page's term as presi-
dent had ended. The code still
exists today, but is called the
Statement of Student Rights and

Wednesday, January 19, 2011 // The Statement 5

W ith more than $1.1 billionspent on
research last year, the University
is a major competitor in the global
research community.
It's viewed not only as an economic driver in
the state of Michigan, but leaders throughout the
country and the globe look to Ann Arbor to help
solve real issues affecting our world today. From
legislators in Washington to executives on Wall
Street or in Silicon Valley, the University of Michi-
gan is regarded as one of the world's foremost
research universities.
And now, at a time when advances in technol-
ogy are occurring more rapidly than ever before
and with frequent scientific breakthroughs, insti-
tutions like the University are being thrust into
the spotlight as sources of knowledge and agents
of change that can help address the problems we
face today and the issues of tomorrow.
It's a tall order since many individuals believe
the primary responsibility of universities needs
to be educating students. However, it's something
that top officials at the University of Michigan say
they hope to expand and build on as they rethink
the way faculty and students come together to
learn and research.
A HISTORICAL TRANSFORMATION
Though industry leaders and elected officials
alike look to the University for answers, the role of
research universities hasn't always been placed so
prominently in working to solve the issues of our
era.
In fact, as Stephen Forrest, the University's
vice president for research, said it wasn't until
several decades ago that people outside academia
even viewed universities as a source of creating
knowledge.
"Traditionally, probably up to about 40 maybe
30 years ago even, universities were regarded
as places that stored knowledge ... sort of like a
library," Forrest explained in an interview earlier
this month. "And then a transformation started to
occur."
With the transformation came a new view of
what role research universities could play in soci-
ety - shifting to a system in which universities
could draw students and faculty together through
research to both teach and help combat serious
world issues.
"It really took root as time went on that uni-
versities were places that weren't just repositories
of knowledge, but were places where new knowl-
edge was built primarily," Forrest said. "And
they've really taken that role in our society as the
primary location where new knowledge is gener-
ated."
However, the change has led some to criticize
faculty at major research universities for caring
more about their research than about teaching
students. Many students on college campuses have
grumbled at least once to a friend about how one
of their professors doesn't care about teaching, but
instead only wants to focus on his or her research.
And while such criticism may indeed have
its place with choice faculty members, three of
the University's top officials took a very differ-
ent stance. University President Mary Sue Cole-
man, Provost Philip Hanlon and Forrest told The
Michigan Daily in a series of interviews over the
past month that faculty research is fundamental
to quality student education.

BALANCING TEACHING AND
RESEARCH
In a meeting lastmonth in her second-
floor office suite in the Fleming Administration
Building, Coleman made it clear that she believes
research and teaching go hand in hand.
"A lot of people think about it in two separate
boxes, I don't," Coleman said, responding to a
question about the "proper" balance of teaching
and research at the University.
"What I think about is that if you're able to
expose students to the cutting edge and you're
able to learn from somebody who's actually doing
the work, that you get a richer experience than if
you don't."
This is a view shared by other top leaders at the
University like Hanlon, who said the University's
core missions of teaching, research, patient care
and service are all intertwined.
But it's Forrest who perhaps articulates the
administration's position best.
"From an educational point of view, I think
the research enterprise is absolutely inextricably
linked with the educational mission because to
really learn things, you have to learn things at the
forefront."
Forrest continued by explaining that today's
college students are seeing changes in entire
generations of technology while in school. With
such rapid changes, he said, it's necessary to learn
directly from the people making those changes to
stay up to date when learning.
"What you really want to be doing is learning
from people who are part of that revolution and
become part of that revolution while you're an
undergraduate student and certainly as a graduate
student," Forrest said.
And for Forrest, learning in a laboratory is
much more effective than reading a book.
A graduate of the University of California-Berk-
ley, Forrest took a few years off before enrolling at
the University of Michigan for his graduate stud-
ies. Forrest claims he forgot nearly everything he
learned in his undergraduate studies because he
didn't have any hands on experiences with the
material.
"I actually went through all of my undergradu-
ate education without a research experience in a
laboratory where you're seeking new knowledge,"
Forrest said.
It wasn't until he came to the University for
his graduate studies that he was able to work in
a lab and apply his learning to real world issues -
something he says made the material stick with
him.
"I was amazed at howI had virtually forgotten
everything that I had learned as a physics student
when I came to the University of Michigan," For-
rest recalled. "It was only when I was here as a
graduate student, where I paired the book to the
knowledge that I was generating in the laboratory,
that it stuck."
RETHINKING HOW
RESEARCH IS DONE
But setting up cookie-cutter laboratory practi-
cums for students isn't enough to compete in
today's education and research worlds. Coleman,
Hanlon and Forrest all say there is more work that

the University can do to continue driving the suc-
cess of the University's research enterprise, which
helps to also drive its academic mission.
With that in mind, University administrators
have been working to leverage the breadth and
depth of the expertise of faculty at the University
in clustered research areas like health care ser-
vices and functional, molecular and structural
imaging.
With ongoing efforts in Washington and across
the country to understand what lawmakers
want, University officials work to make sure that
research being done at the University is on track
with regional, national and international priorities.
Doing so helps ensure that researchers at the
University can net funding for their projects. And
with an overall research budget that has almost
doubled in the past decade, the work seems to be
paying off.
But in today's tough economic times - the
State Senate Fiscal Agency projected last month
that the state will face a $1.85 billion deficit in the
next fiscal year - it's more important than ever
that University researchers and administrators do
everything they can to stay ahead of the curve.
"The last couple of years have really changed
everything in the country, and I think everything
requires some rethinking as the state and federal
governments grapple with what appears to be
really daunting budget challenges," Hanlon said
last month. "It's a time to rethink everything."
One way top officials at the University are doing
this is to restructure the way research is conducted.
Instead of taking a more traditional approach
and having faculty members work in small labo-
ratories where they focus on a single aspect of
somethingthey're interested in, many researchers
at the University are now taking a more interdis-
ciplinary approach by teaming up with groups of
faculty members from different disciplines across
campus to attack a problem from its core.
And though strength may come in numbers, it's
still a massive undertaking - not only to solve the
large real world problems being tackled, but also
to coordinate the number of researchers working
on different aspects of the issue and to get faculty
to buy in.
"We have historically had a sort of bottom up
approach to the problems we solve and the impacts
we have. That's great, it allows all the faculty mem-
bers to be entrepreneurs and figure out what it is
they're most interested in," Hanlon said. "But what
it means is that, as a university, you don't take on in
an organized way some really big problems.
"I think it would be really neat if we as a univer-
sity could be coordinated and organized around
some really, really big problems in a sort of deliber-
ate way," Hanlon added. "It's not that we don't end
up looking at important problems, we absolutely
do, but we don't try to organize that effort."
A DIFFERENT BLUEPRINT
Effectively urging researchers to move away
from the current model of research and instead
move to a model where individual research efforts
are clustered around one or two major real world
problems isn't easy.
Despite this, it's something that Coleman says
the University is better positioned to do than most
other universities. And Forrest says it's something
the University must do.
