FINANCING EDUCATION
Regents
approve
tuition
Tuition increases 6.7
percent for in-state
and 4.9 percent for
out-of-state students
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
After a historic drop in state
funding, the University's Board
of Regents voted on Thursday to
increase tuition for in-state and
out-of-state students.
In a 6-2 vote, the regents
approved a 6.7-percent tuition
increase for in-state students and
a 4.9-percent increase for out-of-
state students. The tuition hikes
translate to a net increase of $797
for in-state students and $1,781 for
out-of state students for next year.
Despite the increases, Univer-
sity administrators emphasized
that some students may actually
pay less than they did for the 2010-
2011 academic year, as the amount
of need-based financial aid avail-
able will increase by 10.9 percent to
$137 million.
"These extraordinary amounts
of support mean that a typical
Michigan resident undergraduate,
with a family income of less than
$80,000, pays less today ... than in
2004," University President Mary
Sue Coleman said at the meeting.
In addition to tuition increases,
the University was forced to cut $44
million from the budget in order to
close a $47.5 million shortfall as a
result of a15-percent cut in the state

'U' offers students
and faculty smoking
cessation programs
By BETHANY BIRON and
YOUNJOO SANG
'Editor in Chief and
Daily StaffReporter
As signs begin to appear along
the perimeter of campus signify-
ing the imminent arrival of the
campus-wide smoking ban that
takes effect on July 1, University
officials and students are prepar-
ing for the upcoming change.
The ban is part of a University
initiative to engage the campus
in a "process of social change"

that will encourage healthier liv-
ing, according to Robert Win-
field, the University's chief health
officer, director of the University
Health Service and co-chair ofthe
Smoke-Free University Steering
Committee.
According to the Smoke-
Free University Initiative Report
released in January and devel-
oped by the Smoke-Free Univer-
sity Steering Committee, the ban
will allow smoking only on side-
walks adjacent to public roads on
the campuses of all three branch-
es of the University - Ann Arbor,
Dearborn and Flint - and in the
privacy of one's own vehicle.
In regard to enforcement of
the ban, Winfield said students
who fail to comply will have a

complaint filed with the Office of
Student and Conflict Resolution
where they will undergo a media-
tion process before consequences
are determined.
For faculty who refuse to
adhere to the ban's requirements,
Winfield said they will face a stan-
dard disciplinary process that may
lead to a supervisor placing them
in a smokingcessation program. If
they continue to smoke on campus
property, Winfield said this could
"ultimately lead to serious disci-
plinary action or discharge."
Winfield said that students
and faculty members who may
struggle with quitting smoking
as a result of the new policy have
a multitude of resources available

STATE BUDGET
Gov. Snyder to sign state budget into law

Despite cuts, 'U'
assures students
will recieve quality
education
By SARAH ALSADEN
Daily Staff Reporter
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's
proposed budget - which was sent
to his desk on June 7 for a signa-
ture after receiving approval from
both the state House and Senate
- is expected to be signed into law
within the next week.
The proposed budget includes
a 15-percent cut in funding for
higher education, and once signed,
the University will experience an
approximate $47 million dollar cut
for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, which
begins July 1 - a sizeable cut that
reduces the University to the level
of funding they received in 1964.
Kurt Weiss, public information
officer for the Michigan Depart-
ment of Technology, Management
and Budget, said despite the vast
cuts, Snyder's proposed budget
aims to help students by including
an incentive foruniversities to keep
tuition prices low by mandating
that tuition rates do not increase
more than the five-year average of

71 percent.
"The reason that incentive was
put in there - the 7.1 percent rule
- was to try to hold tuition hikes
down," Weiss said. "The goal was
to try to incentivize Universities
to not hike tuition drastically as a
result of this cut."
In accordance with this pro-
posal, the University's Board of
Regents voted to increase tuition
by 6.7 percent for in-state students
and 2.9 percent for out-of-state
student at their monthly meeting,
according to a June 16 article in
The Michigan Daily.
In a University press release,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said that while the admin-
istration ultimately had to raise
tuition in response to difficult eco-
nomic times in the state, it would
not compromise the quality of edu-
cation provided by the University.
"While we continue to control
costs, we are driven by the funda-
mental missions of academic excel-
lence and affordability," Coleman
said. "On this we cannot and will
not compromise. This generation
of students expects their Michi-
gan education to be the same qual-
ity and deliver the same positive
impact in their lives as all those
who have come before. Our job is to
deliver on that promise."
Weiss echoed Coleman's sen-

timents and said that despite the
cuts, the administration believes
the University can maintain their
level of distinction in providing a
quality education to students.
"From a budget office perspec-
tive and from the administration's
perspective, we feel that the cuts
that have been proposed are doable
and that the University can contin-
ue to provide a great education for
the kids here in Michigan, for our
students," Weiss said.
She added that while the state
itself is looking for ways to cut
costs, so are the various universi-
ties around Michigan. It will ulti-
mately be up to each individual
college to determine how to best
allocate their funds and determine
policy, she said.
"(The state is) looking for uni-
versities to adopt the best practices,
to find savings in operational areas
- whether that be healthcare, non-
instructional line items," Weiss
said. "It would be up to each uni-
versity as to how to become more
efficient."
According to the University
press release, in order for the Uni-
versity to follow these recommen-
dations, sacrifices must be made,
including cutting employee ben-
efits and closing programs.
"The University will ask
employees to pay more for health

benefits, close several centers,
reduce operational staff through
attrition when possible, and reduce
and implement a host of other cost-
cutting measures campus-wide,"
the press release states.
John Jackson, a political sci-
ence professor at the University,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
though he believed the cuts may
be effective in balancing the state
budget, they might not be the most
effective in mitigating damage
done to the state's economy in the
long term, largely because it may
discourage students from attending
and graduating from the University.
"There is very sound research
that shows that economic growth
and performance at all levels -
metropolitan, state and national -
increases with the education level
and with the proportion of college
graduates," Jackson wrote.
Jackson added that research
has presented evidence that a high
number of college graduates is
instrumental in helping to trans-
form ailing economies like Michi-
gan's.
"If the shift from state to per-
sonal funding for college atten-
dance, which has been going on
for decades, reduces the number
attending the implications are
not good for the state's economy,"
Jackson wrote.

University instates new study abroad policy

Students and faculty
must now purchase
insurance, confirm
with registry
By PATRICIA SNIDER
Daily StaffReporter
Changes have recently been
made to the University's inter-
national travel policy in hopes of
improving the study abroad expe-
rience for University members
traveling overseas.
According to John Godfrey,
chair of the International Travel
Oversight Committee, there are
three major changes being made
to international travel policy at the
University, including an alteration
to the University's risk assessment

of possible study abroad locations,
a mandate that all student travel-
ers have insurance and a require-
ment that students register with
the University's travel registry.
Godfrey said previous study
abroad sites were determined
based on State Department travel
warnings, while the new policy
allows the University to evaluate
the risks of locations themselves
and be more involved in the deci-
sion-making process of where to
send students.
"The benefits are going to be
enormous, as far as the Univer-
sity's ability to support all of our
travelers overseas in case they
have any problems," Godfrey said.
"Study abroad is evolving ... with
this new policy at hand, we might
be in a position to better evaluate
current risks and conditions and
make recommendations under

certain circumstances for study
abroad programs going forward."
He added that the State
Department travel warnings are
useful, but can limit the study
abroad experience of students.
"We've been considering this
for a number of years - that our
use of state travel warnings is easy
for us to use ... on the other hand
it comes at considerable costs,"
Godfrey said. "As a policy, we
found ourselves ending programs
in countries that did not have any
considerable risks."
According to a June 15 Univer-
sity press release, changes to the
international travel policy were
decided after Mark Tessler, vice
provost for international affairs,
consolidated a review of peer uni-
versity study abroad policies.
"Knowing where our students
and their mentors are and being

able to reach them is absolutely
essential in an emergency," Tes-
sler said in the release. "The low-
cost insurance coverage provides
a means to get assistance to them
when needed."
Godfrey said the required
study abroad insurance may ease
concerns of travelers and their
families, particularly because it's
cost efficient since its valued at "a
little over a buck and a quarter a
day." The insurance will provide
full coverage, 24-hour emergency
toll-free calls to English-speaking
personnel and evacuation if need-
ed.
While undergraduates have
been required to have Univer-
sity study abroad insurance since
2008, the new policy requires
everyone traveling through the
University to have insurance,

SMOKING BAN
From Page 1
to them. Over-the-counter prod-
ucts - such as nicotine patches
and gum - will be given out free,
and prescriptions will be provided
for a small co-pay for those who
are insured.
Marsha Benz, alcohol and
other drugs health educator at
the University, said that similar
to faculty members, students will
have the opportunity to engage in
smoking cessation programs on
both Central and North Campus,
either individually or in classes
with other smokers.
According to Benz, only about
14 percent of undergraduates
smoke, and of this group most are
just social smokers who smoke
fairly minimally.
"Most of those students are
smoking between one and five
cigarettes a week, so they're not
smoking a lot," Benz said. "And
we hear a lot that they're smok-
ing maybe when they go to the bar,
maybe a couple cigarettes here and
there."
However, in order to effective-
ly send their message to student
smokers who may be facing addic-
tion, Benz said the University held
various focus groups with both
smokers and non-smokers alike to
better determine how to help stu-
dents, concluding that free cessa-
tion aids would be the best route of
action.
She added that the most prev-
alent issue she found among the
smoking group is they don't want
to be "harassed" into not smoking,
but rather instructed as to where
to find resources and help available
to them, as well as to learn how
they could be better spending their

money.
"They don't want to be
preached to," Benz said. "They
don't want to be told about the
black lung and all that kind of stuff
- they know. Essentially they all
wanted to quit, it was just when
they were going to quit that was
the question and they wanted to
be reminded of was how much it
was costing them to smoke and
what types of things they could be
spending their money on instead."
Winfield said that while reduc-
ing secondhand smoke played a
small role in enacting the ban,
it was ultimately part of a larger
initiative to instill a "culture of
health" on campus through estab-
lishing a more healthful living
environment.
He added that the ban is par-
ticularly important for faculty and
staff members, since they often
stay oncampus for upwards of 10 to
30 years - rather than the four of a
typical undergraduate - and thus
are affected by the implication of
the ban for a longer period of time.
Winfield added that smokers in the
workplace are given additional sick
days and often have more breaks
than their non-smoking counter-
parts, which often impedes pro-
ductivity.
Benz echoed Winfield's sen-
timents about establishing a
healthier environment, saying that
smoking is a habit that individuals
start at a young age, and by forcing
them not to engage with the activ-
ity at all, can ultimately prevent
addiction that may develop in col-
lege.
"Smoking is really a behavior
of childhood," Benz said. "People
start smoking when they're in
junior high and high school here
and there. They become regular
smokers once they come to college

though. If we can get them maybe
before they end up becoming regu-
lar smokers, the chances of them
being dependent once they leave
school is much, much lower."
According to Winfield, the idea
for the ban first came to fruition
five years ago when three student
officer members of the Residence
Halls Association became both-
ered by the fact that they could
order student smokers to stand
farther away from dorms to pre-
vent smoke from filtering in, but
not faculty members. The group
met with Winfield and Loren Rul-
lman, associate vice president for
student affairs, who began to dis-
cuss making the University smoke
free.
Many students, both smokers
and non-smokers alike, seemed
largely supportive of the upcoming
smoking ban.
LSA junior Tim Hausler, who
is a smoker, said that he didn't
mind the smoking ban because he
will still be able to smoke in other
areas.
"To me, it doesn't matter all
that much," Hausler said. "Because
of the fact that it'll still be legal in
the city property."
Kevin Joseph, a chemical
engineering junior, said that he
thought the ban was useful, as he
used to live in the dorms and could
remember smelling people smok-
ing outside the dorm buildings.
Joseph added that he would
prefer to not be subjected to sec-
ondhand smoke and the dangers
associated with it while being on
campus.
"I'm pretty sure most of the
student population doesn't smoke
since they're educated of the
dangers, so they're not likely to
smoke," Joseph said. "I think that
they would appreciate it."

Tuition travesty
Students shouldn't bear the entire burden of funding cuts
 n a trend that is becoming regrettably unsurprising, tuition
will be even higher in the 2011-2012 academic year. As of
Thursday, the University has raised its price for 14 consec-
utive years when the University's Board of Regents approved an
increase of 6.7 percent for in-state students and 4.9 percent for
out-of-state students. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's funding
cuts have placed an incredible burden on educational institu-
tions around the state, but the University took the easy way out
by passing the cuts almost entirely on to students with tuition
increases. These measures will only price out lower income
families and place a more weight on those struggling to pay an

National Com-
ing Out of the ANNA
Shadows Week
was held March CLEMENTS
14-21. There is
even a proposed
National Pagan Coming Out Day, on
May 1. Yet despite the growing num-
ber of cognitive disorders, there is no
nationally recognized day for indi-
viduals battling them to reveal their
situation, made all the more difficult
by their ailment's invisibility. From
sexuality to disability status, to polit-
ical stance to dietary habits (have
you ever tried coming out as vegan in
a frat, or as a carnivore in a co-op?),
it seems that everyone has a closet to
exit. But for those types of "coming
out" that do not have a recognized
week, it is sometimes difficult to fig-
ure out how and when is appropriate.
Imagine that you are on a date
with someone. You make small talk,
laugh and joke around and then she
twitches. "It's just a nerve contrac-
tion caused by my cognitive disor-
der," she explains casually, and then
proceeds to elucidate the other, more
severe symptoms. How on earth are
you supposed to react?
Or alternatively, let's say that you
go out with a friend whom you've just
met. Passing by Necto on gay night,
your companion remarks that it's the
best night for dancing and suggests
that the two of you swing by later.
Your conservative religious back-
ground makes going out dancing a
little bit ethically risque. Is it possible
to casually bring up your beliefs and
the limitations they impose, without
putting a damper on the whole eve-
ning?
Supposedly, the U.S. is a place
where diversity is valued in many
realms. It is important to remember
our different characteristics, espe-
cially when passing judgment over
someone who has just come out as
atheist or as a member of the Tea
Party. And even if there isn't outright
or negative judgment, it is probable
for some awkwardness to linger.
The difficulty in coming out is
doubtfully a personal issue, neither
for those who are in the closet, nor
for those on the other side. It must,
then, be cultural. And how can one

affect cultural norms? Creating safe
spaces - physical, like the Spectrum
Center on campus, or calendrical,
such as coming out days - is one
way of providing an arena for people
to open up about the marginalized
facets of their identities. However,
making distinctly separate spaces
for certain groups segregates them,
so there must be ways to incorpo-
rate people's differences to make the
transition out of the closet a smooth
one.
We have a race and ethnicity
requirement in LSA, mandating that
students take a course that "address
issues arising from racial or ethnic
intolerance." This is one wayto facili-
tate discussions on differences. That
doesn't seem to be enough, though.
Many students go through college
without ever learning how to talk
about the sensitive subjects of which
people's identities are composed.
The consequences of this can be
disastrous, both interpersonally and
politically

I find that
closets induce

already high tuition.
The University's funding
dilemma clearly starts with Sny-
der's budget. As emphasized ad
nauseam, education should be
the last public sector to be cut.
Regardless of his claims to the
contrary, Snyder seems eager
to slash the state expenditure
on education and, invariably, its
quality. The "brain drain" that
the state has experienced over
the past decade and other educa-
tion-related problems will likely
become more severe if education
is continuously neglected by the
state.
Nonetheless, the difficult
situation created by the Michi-
gan Legislature does little to
excuse the poor response taken
by the University. Facing a cut
of $47.5 million in state funds,
the University has passed along
$46.4 million, or 97 percent, of
this load on to students. Surely
there are other ways the Univer-

sity could make up this deficit
besides raising tuition. Meth-
ods in previous years included
operational downsizing and the
elimination of certain programs,
such as the Center for Ethics in
Public Life. With such drastic
cuts, students may have to take
on a portion of the state cuts, but
they shouldn't be forced to han-
dle the entire burden.
Every year college students
around the nation are priced out
of education. To the University's
credit, the increase in tuition
has been coupled with a large
increase in financial aid. Families
making $80,000 per year or less
willnot be impacted bythetuition
hikes. Regardless, the increased
strain on families above this cut-
off is substantial. The University
may strive to maintain its qual-
ity by charging increased tuition
rates instead of making tough
expenditure cuts, but socio-eco-

nomic diversity also leads to the
greatness of the University. The
increase in financial aid is not
enough to help every family who
needs extra money, and there are
going to be families caught in the
middle who are unable to afford
the new price tag.
Where will we be in 15 years if
this yearly tuition increase con-
tinues? The trend is unsustain-
able and alarming. The state's
budget created a tough situa-
tion for Michigan's schools, but
instead of working towards a
creative solution, the University
simply passed the problem along
to an economically ailing popula-
tion. The University may realize
it has a duty to provide a quality
education, but it also must make
that education affordable to the
less wealthy students who also
desire it. The University would
do well to remember that the for-
mer is aided by the latter.

claustrophobia.
political or social views in a friendly
way, then politics will continue to
separate from everyday life. These
issues will build a residence within a
vague conceptual framework, rather
than be interwoven with the issues
we confront daily. In short, what is
necessary is not a National Political
Party or a Sexual Orientation or a
Disability Status Coming Out Day (or
week, or month), but more openness
in general.
I mentioned earlier that coming
out is not a personal problem, but
rather a cultural one. The solution
though, has to be both systemic and
personal. If more individuals force
these issues into the open, then the
system will have to accommodate 4
them. If we stay silent about our dif-
ferences, then they will stayinvisible.
You choose. Personally, I find that
closets induce claustrophobia.

MELANIE KRUVELIS| VW POINT
Where's the beef.

JEFF ZUSCHLAG

As I sit here writing this, I
finish my last bite of steak. Not
because I'm particularly hun-
gry, not because I'm iron deficient
- but because I believe in mak-
ing a difference. Standing up for
what's right: eating meat. Why?
Because advocating for animal
rights is essentially an erroneous,
philosophically-flawed argument
that calls for the defamation of the
human condition simply to prevent
the defecation of the animal.
Philosopher Peter Singer
famously argued that our current
perception of humanity revolves
around a wholly speciesist mindset,
noting that the entirety of human
existence is marked by anthro-
pocentric behavior. We're selfish.
We don't exhibit any empathy for
anything beyond ourselves. Maybe
Denny's Maple Bacon Sundae is a
little indulgent. Maybe we should
consider a different societal system,
one that avoids assigning values to
distinctions between species. You
know, stop putting people first.
Maybe. But probably maybe not.
Speciesism is not only difficult to
say, but idealizes the animal king-
dom, turning it into some fairy tale
Disney theme park. The majestic
two-toed sloth does not spare his
victim - why should we? Yes, it
could be argued that since we do
have a heightened sense of moral-
ity, as exhibited by the congrega-
tion of Westboro Baptist Church
and the cast of "Jersey Shore,"
perhaps we should extend our eth-
ics to beings beyond humans. But
come on, an eye for an eye, right?
It's not just some outdated retribu-
tion principle that should probably
be left in Babylonia - no, no - it's
essential in understanding the lack
of responsibility humans have to
protect animals. And of course,
makes intercourse and Helen
Keller jokes possible.
You can read more about specie-
sism in Larry the Cable Guy's lat-
est novella, "Git-R-Done," available
nationwide at Walmart or truck
stop restrooms. But for now, there
are bigger fish to fry - religion, my
friends, religion. Yes, it's true - you
can keep eating your Double Down
- God wants you to. In Genesis 9,
God told Noah that animals were

inferior to humans. They should
fear us, and we should eat them,
or as the Word of God colorfully
raunched it up - "Every moving
thing that liveth shall be meat for
you." And then Noah gets plastered
and naked in a tent by himself, and
poor Ham has to see his dad Noah's
bacon and eggs.
But I digress. Religions, even
those beyond Christianity, uphold
the inherent value humans have
over animals through the wide-
spread acceptance of dualism, or
the doctrine that states humans are
both physical beings and immate-
rial minds. As Descartes explains
it, animals are simply physical enti-
ties, completely barren of any sort
of moral compass. "(Animals) are
destitute of reason...and it is nature
that acts in them (mechanically)."
He then goes on to explain that dis-
secting "the heartof some large ani-
mal possessed of lungs" is so choice,
and ifyouhave the means, he highly
recommends picking one up.
Anyway, the point - based on
the infallibility of the theological
compliance with dualism, we can
of course infer that humans are the
only creatureswith any moral, epis-
temological value. What separates
humanity from other species is that
animals are simply not conscious
beings (though it could be argued
that many of our fellow humans
here at the University are not exact-
ly conscious beings either; at least
on most Friday evenings). Animals
cannot reason, think, feel pain like
humans do. Nor are they capable
of creating the splendor humans
are capable of. War, crime, Michael
Bolton - these are entirely human
constructs that only truly moral
creatures could produce! Yeah,
you're welcome, Simba.
And so, what have we learned
today? One, my neighbor picks up
the paper in the nude. Two, animal
rights advocates incorrectly argue
that creatures beyond humans have
values, when it's quite clear humans
are the only beings that conduct
themselves with dignity and class.
And hey, if you don't believe me, just
look at Michele Bachmann.

Why they hate us

It's no secret that Arab senti-
ment towards the United States is
incredibly negative. A recent Pew
Research Cen-
ter poll of vari-
ous Muslim
nations found
that in Jordan,
Turkey, Paki-
stan, Egypt
and Palestine,
approximately JONATHAN
15 percent of AYLWARD
people viewed
the U.S. favor-
ably. During the Bush Jr. presi-
dency, the question was often
asked, "Why do they hate us?"
We were quick to claim that they
must hate our freedom.
The truth isn't too hard to see,
and it isn't pretty either. That's
probably why we've clung to our
simplistic clich, avoidingthe less
self-affirming truth. One of the
primary reasons for this abundant
anti-American attitude is actually
much different than the afore-
mentioned Bushism. Though we
have labeled ourselves champions
of democracy and human rights,
by blindly pursuing our economic
interests in the region, we actual-
ly help limit the access to freedom
for entire nations.
About a month ago, in a speech
responding to the events of the
Arab Spring, President Obama
asserted his commitment to the
spread of democracy throughout
the Middle East. He boldly pro-
claimed, "It will be the policy
of the United States to promote
reform across the region, and to
support transitions to democra-
cy." After a long history of strong
economic and political relation-
ships with dictators, this was an
incredibly weighty declaration.
Not surprisingly, it has already
proven to be a largely empty
statement.
Let's pretend that Obama's
speech has created a new para-
digm in U.S. foreign policy. In

r the past we acted with economic
interests in mind, and it was
unimportant whether a nation's
government was democratic or
promoted human rights. How-
ever, according to the speech, the
U.S.'s interests now depend on a
shift to the promotion of democ-
racy and human rights. Conse-
quently, in the time since the
speech, we would expect to have
seen a monumental change in our
relations to a number of regimes.
After gently chastising Yemen
and Bahrain (two close economic
and political allies) in his speech
for their prolonged brutal crack-
downs on pro-democracy pro-
testers, Obama has done little to
demonstrate that we are serious
about adhering to our new ideals.
Just as with Egypt and Mubarak,
the U.S. maintained support for
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh up until the point when it
was obvious that he was on his
way out. Two weeks ago, while
hosting the Bahraini Crown
Prince, Obama pledged enthusi-
astic U.S. support and failed to
acknowledge the ongoing violent
government crackdowns.
The clearest indicator that the
United States will continue to
act out of self-interest, and not
out of concern for democracy
and human rights, is our rela-
tionship with Saudi Arabia. An
Islamic monarchy, the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia prohibits free
speech and political parties, dis-
allows women from driving and
only allows them to travel with
the permission of their closest
male relative. It considers death
an appropriate punishment for
homosexuality and actively cen-
sors the Internet. Yet Saudi Ara-
bia is one of our closest allies in
the region. If this seems incon-
gruent, there's one more impor-
tant fact to consider: They are
the number one exporter of oil in
the world. Clearly democracy and
human rights, let alone stopping

the societal conditions that breed
terrorists, can be put on the back-
burner if you have enough oil for
sale. It's no coincidence that Saudi
Arabia is the birthplace of Osama
bin Laden and fifteen of the nine-
teen hijackers involved in the 9/11
attacks.
Despite Obama's lofty asser-
tion, it's clear that we still active-
ly support regimes that repress
democracy and human rights
in the Middle East. This simple
fact goes a long way in explain-
ing the question we've been ask-
ing since 9/11: "Why do they hate
us?" Anti-American sentiment
will continue to grow as the gap
widens between what we say we
represent and what we actually
represent.
The U.S. limits
freedom for
entire nations.
As the democratic fervor of the
Arab Spring lingers on, we are
faced with two paths: we can truly
embrace the ideals of democ-
racy and human rights with our
actions, or we can continue to
simply talk about them. One
choice garners the support of the
masses, one further exacerbates
our current dilemma. As people in
the Middle East continue to reject
dictators and implement democ-
racies more representative of pub-
lit sentiment, the United States'
popularity will shift from a mere
statistic with little consequence,
to the unpleasant political reality
of decreased trade opportunities
and an increasingly isolated role
in the world.

By ANKUR SOHONI
Daily Arts Writer
Movies are miraculous. Pro-
jected illusions of life, engineered
to entertain and
keep us in our ***
seats, collected in
the dark for hours The Tree
on end - it's all Of Life
very silly, after
all. But film taps At the
something inside Michigan
people that noth-
ing else does, hit- F Seanchlighl
ting a rhythmic
visual chord that is - at least to an
extent - organic and natural.
There are rules, though.
Sometimes, you can make a film
like visual poetry, like Godfrey Reg-
gio in his 1980s films "Koyaanisqat-
si" and "Powaqqatsi." Or Ron Fricke
in 1992 with "Baraka."All three pic-
tures were montages of nature and
civilization, without narrative.
Those movies are cool. Awesome,
actually, if you have the energy to
stay awake. But when you see a
trailer for a film featuring Brad Pitt
and Sean Penn in leading roles, you
don't expect that. You expect face-
time, and lots of it. And when that
doesn't quite happen - when a film
experience is so completely differ-

ent than what you expect - how do
the masses in the dark respond?
Easy. They walk out.
Forget the rhythmic chord inside
us. Film is a social thing, not only
independent but something to
facilitate our interactions with oth-
ers. And when the first 40 minutes
of "Tree of Life" turn out lifelessly
incomprehensible, it's not surpris-
ing to see people flocking back to
the ticket counter to retrieve their
12 bucks, or actually boo the film, as
at this year's Cannes Film Festival.
The film has a whispery-beauti-
ful opening set in the 1950s around
the.O'Brien family, a young couple
and their three boys. The mother
(Jessica Chastain, "Jolene") sets
up the opposition of "grace" and
"nature" - the balance of spiritual-
ity and humanity that tugs on both
ends of the film.
That "nature" is presented as
the stern Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt,
"Inglourious Basterds"), who
teaches his sons thatethey must fight
to find their place in the world. His
antithesis is Chastain's delicate per-
formance as his wife, who strives to
be the "grace" end of the equation.
The film begins with the death
of one of their sons, as presented
in mysterious jump cuts and unex-
plained hints. The parents despair

and contemplate the death of a child
in each of their own ways.
Then it all takes a strange turn,
thrusting into a half-hour (or at
least it feels that long) exploration
of forests, the cosmos, dinosaurs
and volcanoes (among many, many
other things) throughout which not
a word is spoken.
And that's when the audience
may become somewhat unruly, and
it's hard to blame them.
But right when you think the
ordeal will never end, it does, push-
ing the story back to the O'Briens
and, in a different time and place,
their grown-up eldest son Jack
(Sean Penn, "Milk"), who barely
says a word but his eyes seem to
contemplate mortality.
Jack is the focus of the rest of the
film - his younger version (newcom-
er Hunter McCracken) grows from
an innocentyouth to atroubled ado-
lescent. He witnesses the drown-
ing of a friend, which prompts him
to whisper to the heavens, "Why
should I be good if you aren't?"
"The Tree of Life" is an utterly
polarizing picture, and not only
in the way you experience it. It's a
story of fathers and sons, death and
God, poetry and pragmatism. As
a whole, though, it's about more,
and it's about you - the way you

approach life, faith and the deci-
sions therein.
By the end of the film, who is still
sitting in the theater? Perhaps it's
the population of only one end of
that central balance.
On the technical side, Emmanuel
Lubezki's ("Children of Men") cin-
ematography is the epitome of stun-
ning. Even in its dullest moments,
the film is an unforgettable pictur-
escape that wows the eyes.
Yet, as sumptuous as it is, the film
struggles to satisfy even the most
patient. Character arcs are told in
glimpses and whispered voiceovers,
not the screams of regular summer
fare. It is a testament to director
Terrance Malick's ("The Thin Red
Line") genius that there are dis-
cernable arcs at all. But if only there
were something more to take away,
an easy reward for our patience. For
a film that seems so meaningful, it
veers awfully close to commonplace
nonspecificity of purpose.
Film professors will tell you; If
you can tell a story without saying
a word, do it. Terrance Malick tries
something in that vein and succeeds
in many ways. The film can change
the way you see storytelling on the
screen. Whether that change is for
the better or worse really depends
on your own outlook.

Unrealized potential ruins 'Green Lantern'

AD
VER
TISE
WITH
THE
CLASS
IFIEDS

By KAVI SHEKAR PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
To directly contradict Kermit the
Frog's proclamation, it's quite easy
being green, especially if you're
the Green Lantern. The DC Com-
ics superhero is
venerated among
comics readers
for his stupen- Green
dous storylines,
and since the
Lantern usually At Quality 16
plays no less than and Rave
third banana
to Batman and Warner Bros.
Superman in the
Justice League, even Joe Schmo has
a passingresemblance to his name.
When the character's ticket
to the silver screen was finally
punched, it was put under the ten-
der-loving care of talented comic
writer Geoff Johns, arming direc-
tor Martin Campbell (who reboot-
ed the shit out of James Bond in
("Casino Royale") with a reported
$200 million budget and casting

Ryan Reynolds ("The Proposal") -
the hubba-hubba hunk that women
throw their drawers at and men
respect, well, because he was once
married to Scarlett Johansson - as
Hal Jordan.
And after all that, "Green Lan-
tern" is a conflagration of ridicu-
lously amateurish storytelling and
pathetically poor characters, think-
ing it can squirrel behind its fagade
of snazzy special effects and call ita
wrap. Well, you can't spoon a dollop
of creme fraiche onto cow dung and
deem it edible. As the Comic Book
Guy would likely say, "Worst comic-
book movie featuring a middle-tier
DC superhero ever."
"Green Lantern" is doomed from
its first act, where wildly confus-
ing exposition, delivered by Geof-
frey Rush's ("The King's Speech")
monotone, rockets the audience
off into the Land of Bewilderment
before introducing us to our hero,
Hal Jordan. That's "hero" in the
lightest sense of the term, since
Hal is a cocky, reckless, woman-
izing blowhard we're supposed to

like anyways because - gasp -
his father died when he was a kid.
Hal will grow up by the end of the
movie, but once he gets the ring he
just becomes drab, and isn't as excit-
ed and/or surprised that he was just
chosen to join an intergalactic force
as he probably should be.
Reynolds is clearly trying his
darndest out there, but he's dragged
down by the insolvent screenplay
and his anti-chemistry with Blake
Lively (TV's "Gossip Girl"). Then
there's the case of Peter Saarsgaard
("An Education"), gagging and
squealing (read: obnoxiously over-
acting) as Dr. Hector Hammond, a
villain so transcendently hideous he
makes Jabba the Hut look like Clive
Owen. Hammond isn't remotely
intimidating (unless fugliness
counts as a superpower) and may
just be the most ineffectual villain
since LeBron James.
What's most disappointing is
Campbell's sloppy direction. He
handles the action well, particu-
larly Hal's training sequence, but
everything else is slapdash. One of

the film's more egregious instanc-
es of Great Moments in Directo-
rial Ineptitude occurs during Hal's
goosebumps-inducing first recital
of the Green Lantern oath, in the
middle of which Campbell inexpli-
cably cuts to Hammond sticking
his hand into a dead alien's open
wound. Gross, in more ways than
one.

the show, bringing the songs that
so many know so well to life. And to
top it all off, Marshall added unbri-
dled energy into the entire set.
"I think the reason Bonnaroo
is so open-minded to (hip hop) is
because it started as a jam band fes-
tival," said Warren Haynes of Gov't
Mule, The Allman Brothers Band
and The Dead at the press confer-
ence. "When the jam band move-
ment started, my only complaint
was, it needs to be more open-mind-
ed."
"It needs to include other genres
(like) bluegrass, jazz, blues, hip hop,
reggae, whatever, because the only
thingyou need to be a jam band is to
improvise and have a mindset that
goes along with this," he added.
Needless to say, the festival had
its fair share of guitar-driven acts as
well with mind-blowingsets from
My Morning Jacket, Arcade Fire
and The Black Keys.
In usual Bonnaroo form, the
lineup paid tribute to the past
with singers like Wanda Jackson
and Mavis Staples being booked
this year. The two legends used
their songs as a backdrop to tell
their life stories, fillingin the gaps
between music with anecdotes
about personal experiences rang-

ity and positive energy once again

Q&A: Boston's Rich Hill

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Entering the 2011 MLB season,
the Boston Red Sox were a favorite
pick to vie for another World Series
berth.
But while Red Sox Nation was
restless for the hyped season to
begin, a longtime Boston fan and
former Michigan pitcher, Rich Hill,
was stuck in Pawtucket, R.I. with
the Red Sox's Triple-A affiliate -
the Pawtucket Red Sox.
Hill grew up dreaming of play-
ing in Fenway Park; his high school
is just nine miles away from the
storied stadium. So while Boston
was off to a sluggish start, Hill's
numbers were impressive. He was
shortly rewarded with a call-up to
the bigleagues.
The Michigan Daily recently
spoke with Hill about his experi-
ences at Michigan and his dream
fulfillment to pitch with the Red
Sox.
Unfortunately, since the inter-
view, he injured his elbow and will
miss the remainder of the season
after undergoing Tommy John
elbow surgery.
The Michigan Daily: As a Bos-
ton kid, what factored in your deci-
sion to come to Michigan?
Rich Hill: The opportunity to
attend the University of Michigan
and play baseball there and obvi-
ously the academic-athletic com-
bination you get there - I don't
think you find that at too many
universities. That's not to dog other
universities; it's just a very unique
situation at Michigan.
TMD: After your sophomore
year, you were drafted by the Ana-
heim Angels. Why did you pass
up that opportunity and decide to
return to Michigan?
RH: To get a year closer to my
degree and also to come back and
play for a Big Ten title. I wanted to
come back and play with a lot of the
guys that I came in with and the
friends that I had over the couple
years. It was that opportunity to
play with them again one last time
and that was pretty special.
TMD: After you left Michigan,
you told the Daily that finishing
school and getting a degree was
important to you. Are you still plan-
ning to graduate?
RH: Yeah, I've been working on
that as of late. The last couple of
years, I've been trying to figure out
when I can do this, but it's been very
difficult with the baseball season

going into late October, when the
first semester is at least a good way
through. (That makes it) difficult
to work through the last year of my
degree. It's been tough, but with a
lot of courses being offered online
now and a lot of universities around
Boston, I could take some classes
in the Boston area and have them
transfer over to the University of
Michigan.
TMD: What were your favorite
parts of being at Michigan and in
Ann Arbor, away from the baseball
field?
RH: When I look back on it, just
the campus itself and going to the
football games and hockey games.
Obviously, those were a , blast.
Wherever you go, you carry Uni-
versity of Michigan with you as
part of your identity. My wife and
I (a graduate of Michigan's Nursing
School) went on a trip to the Gala-
pagos Island and there was a doctor
who was on the trip who's a doctor
at Mott Children's Hospital. We did
some work with Mott (when I was
there). It's just a small world with
over 450,000 alumni.
TMD: For most of your life -- at
Michigan and with the Cubs - you
were a starting pitcher, but now in
Boston, you've found success as a
reliever. Would you like to become
a starter again, or are you happy in
the bullpen?
RH: I enjoy coming out of the
bullpen. It's been something that
I've had to make some adjustments
and find your routine that you stick
with and that's been the biggest
thing - just getting into a good rou-
tine coming out of the bullpen and
sticking with it. I think that's some-
thing that's my niche.
TMD: Growing up in Boston,
you had to live with the Curse of the
Bambino and all the Red Sox's dis-
appointments. This year, Boston is
an odds-on favorite to win a World
Series. Obviously, the Red Sox have
won a few recent titles, but what
would it mean to win a World Series
for your hometown team?
RH: It'd be great. Just to see how
the teams from 2004 and 2007 were
embraced in Boston - and obvi-
ously the fans in Boston are very
studious and they understand the
game and the ups and downs, they
live and die with the team - you're
representing an entire city. In the
end, if it comes to fulfillment with
a World Series Championship, that
would be - for me, especially, being
from the area - something that I'd
never forget.

Michigan should steer clear of a mascot debacle

anny Bleigh isthe only man
inthe world who knows the
feeling.
During a Sept. 17, 1988 matchup
against Miami, Willy the Wolverine
stepped onto the
turf at Michi-

spectators. He

vision, becom-
ing the only
costumed mascot ever to represent
Michigan at the Big House.
Three weeks later, there were
security guards at every gate tasked
with keeping Willy out of the sta-
dium. And only one man truly
understands. Bleigh was Willy the
Wolverine that day.
Thisweek, Athletic Director Dave
Brandon opened a can of worms that
was kept firmly sealed for the past
two decades - and one that was
largely forgotten in the 194 years at
the University of Michigan.
In an interview with Michigan
Today, Brandon said that, given the

right conditions, he would reopen
the discussion on Michigan having
a mascot.
"I'm struck by the fact that when
opposing teams come to our sta-
dium, and they bring a mascot, all of
our young fans are lined up to see if
they can get a picture taken with it,
whether it's the Penn State Nittany
Lion or Sparty," Brandon told Michi-
gan Today. "That's a little annoying
to me."
Brandon's answer certainly
has Michigan fans up in arms, but
this isn't the first time the Athletic
Department has considered adding
a mascotto headlinesporting events.
In 1927, then-head football coach
Fielding H. Yost brought a pair of live
wolverines to patrol the sideline. But
Biff and Bennie proved too danger-
ous and were given the pink slip.
So Michigan became the one
school that prided itself in being rep-
resented by its tradition and history
rather than a visible, cuddly mascot.
The fact of not having a mascot has
become a tradition of its own.
Butinthe late 1980s, a pair ofUni-
versitystudentsbegan acampaignto
give Michigan its first-ever mascot:
Willy the Wolverine. Willy was the
brainchild of Adam Blumenkranz
and David Kaufman, who created

the furry, nine-foot beast and their
store, Willy's, at the corner of Lib-
erty and State.
Willy made his debut at the
Miami game, but his time in the
spotlight was cut short when the
Spartans came to town - along with
the security guards.
"I tell you, everyone who's met
Willy loves him," Bleigh, the one-day
Willy, told The Michigan Daily. "I
put on the costume and step outside
and cars come to a screeching halt.
"The cheerleaders want a mascot,
the fans want a mascot, the students
want a mascot. The time is now."
But the time wasn't "now." And it
still isn't. Then-Daily sports editor
and current NFL Network analyst
Rich Eisen said it right.
"Picture it," Eisen wrote. "A Wol-
verine running all over the place to
lead the crowd in cheers.
"In Michigan Stadium, for crying
out loud. Where Bo works. Just say
no to Willy."
Even Bo himself had some
thoughts on Willy. After a 1989
matchup with Michigan State,
Schembechler sidledup to agroup of
reporters and gave his opinion.
"I've got a wolverine skin - it
looks like a big skunk, but don't put
that down, boys," he said with a
