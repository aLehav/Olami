Research shows 

tailgating could be 
a factor in reported 

offenses

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

There’s nothing quite like 

a fall Saturday in Ann Arbor. 
From the stream of maize 

and blue rolling down State 
Street onto Stadium, to the 
tailgates, to the team, the 
team, the team, football game 
days are largely seen as part 
of the quintessential Michigan 
experience.

But 
other 
game 
day 

traditions are familiar to many 
students as well: traveling to 
the game in packs, keeping an 
eye out for friends at tailgates, 
getting sick from drinking too 

Representative 

shows support and 
offers assistance 
with campaign

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell 

(D–Dearborn) visited campus 
on Saturday to speak with 

members 
of 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

Students for Hillary.

Dingell 
discussed 
her 

reasons for supporting Hillary 
Clinton’s campaign for the 
Democratic nomination and 
said she would help Students 
for Hillary in any way she can 
in its efforts leading up to the 
Michigan primary on March 8.

Dingell 
drew 
from 
her 

personal experiences working 
with Clinton in advocating for 
her candidacy.

“I do want (Clinton) to win, 

to be perfectly frank,” she said. 
“I’m competitive. I worked 
with Hillary. I saw her work 
with John (Dingell) on health 
care in the ‘90s, and she is the 
best person for the job.”

Students for Hillary has 

been organizing phone banks 
since last fall, during which 
students call potential voters 
and attempt to convince them 
to vote for Clinton in the 
upcoming primaries. Recently, 

the 
group 
has 
worked 
to 

call voters in Iowa and New 
Hampshire, but as Michigan’s 
primary 
nears, 
the 
group 

is turning it’s attention to 
Michigan.

LSA 
sophomore 
Anushka 

Sarkar, event coordinator and 
outreach director of Students 
for Hillary, said the group is 
phone banking because it is 
important voters hear why 
supporters 
are 
voting 
for

Business school 
one of first in the 
country to partner 

with company

By JENNIFER MEER

Daily Staff Reporter

Last week, the Ross School 

of 
Business 
announced, 
in 

collaboration 
with 
Nielsen 

Holdings 
N.V., 
that 
MBA 

students will gain access to 
Nielsen’s Answers on Demand 
Core platform and point-of-sale 
data.

Nielsen is a leading U.S. 

company that measures and 
studies 
consumer 
trends 

around the world. Businesses 
utilize Nielson’s data in order 
to improve their marketing 
strategies 
and 
stimulate 

growth. 
Point-of-sale 
data 

refers to raw data that Nielsen 
collects based on consumer 
purchases, 
among 
other 

categories, and the AOD refers 
to their user database where 
businesses come to gather this 
data. Ross is among the first 

business schools to have access 
to the data.

The idea for the partnership 

with Nielsen arose four years 
ago out of a proposal by the 
University’s student-run MBA 
Marketing Club to create a 
Marketing Lab within Ross. 
The lab’s mission statement is to 
prepare students for “marketing 
careers through action-based 
analysis of in-market data.” The 
lab is set to open in fall 2016.

Heather Byrne, managing 

director of the Master of 
Business 
Administration 

program, has been working with 
students and administration to 
establish the lab. She explained 
in an e-mail interview that the 
development culminated with 
Nielsen in recent months.

“Earlier 
this 
year, 
the 

students, myself, our Associate 
Dean for the MBA Program 
got on a call to talk more about 
having access to the Nielsen 
data,” she wrote. “I think 
having that joint phone call 
may have been a turning point, 
because it became clear to 
Nielsen that not only was this 
important to the students but

LSA sophomore Anita Vaishampayan and LSA senior Esha Biswas perform in Swaranjali, a classical Indian dance and 
music show, presented by Michigan Sahana at the Michigan Union on Saturday.

Participants 
emphasize the 

creative nature of 

performances

By MARGOT SHERIDAN

For the Daily

The Rogel Ballroom of the 

Michigan Union filled Sunday 
for a night of Indian music and 

dance.

The annual winter concert, 

Swaranjali, is organized by 
Michigan Sahana, a group 
of 
Indian 
classical 
artists 

focused on the performance 
and 
appreciation 
of 
the 

traditional Indian art forms. 
These 
students 
organize 

concerts 
and 
educational 

events throughout the year to 
spread awareness of India’s 
traditions of music and dance.

LSA 
freshman 
and 

Sahana 
member 
Krithika 

Balakrishnan 
said 
the 

concert allows participants to 
integrate their own creative 
ideas into the performance.

“Swaranjali is an unthemed 

concert, 
so 
musicians 

and 
artists 
can 
explore 

whatever they want. It’s not 
constrained, it’s a lot more 
open,” she said. “The dancers

City Council to 
promote current 
interim to full- 
time position 

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor will conclude 

its months-long, nationwide 
search for a new police chief 
by promoting internally. City 
Council is expected to confirm 
Jim Baird — currently the 
interim 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 

Department chief — as the 
chief of police at its meeting 
Monday.

The search for a new chief 

began following the retirement 
of former Police Chief John 
Seto, concluding a 25-year 
AAPD career. In May 2015, 
Seto took a new position in 
the University of Michigan 
Housing Security and Safety 
Services. Baird was named 
interim chief during the search 
for a replacement.

An estimated 20 
percent of bikes 

left to rust over the 

winter season

By KEVIN LINDER

For the Daily

On March 20, the University 

of 
Michigan 
will 
begin 

removing bicycles that have 
been abandoned at bike racks 

across campus.

In 
an 
e-mail 
interview, 

University 
Landscape 

Architect Kenn Rapp wrote 
that beginning in fall of 2015, 
representatives from the UM 
Grounds 
Department, 
UM 

Parking and Transportation, 
UM Police Department and 
the University Planner Office 
began developing a new plan 
to address the growing issue 
of bicycle abandonment on 
campus. 

“We’ve been noticing an 

increase in the number of 
complaints about abandoned 
bikes taking up space on the 
racks,” Rapp wrote. “The UM 
Grounds Department is out 
on campus every day and the 
number of abandoned bikes 
that are on the racks has 
become more noticeable in 
recent years.”

Currently, it is estimated 

that abandoned bikes take up 
approximately 20 percent of 
bike rack space on campus, 
according to Rapp.

“We estimate that there 

could be as many as 1,500 to 
2,000 
abandoned 
bikes 
on 

campus,” Rapp wrote.

For 
cyclists 
such 
as 

Engineering senior Cat Culkin, 
the lack of bike parking can be 
a nuisance. Culkin said while at 
areas, like the Union, it can be 
difficult to find bicycle parking 
because of its central location, 

she has seen abandoned bikes. 
Culkin said she knows of one 
bike at the EECs which she 
estimates has been parked for 
three years in the same spot. 

“I 
don’t 
want 
anyone 

to have their bike taken 
or something if it wasn’t 
abandoned,” Culkin said, “so 
I totally get why people are 
worried. But, yeah, it would 
be nice to have more bike 
parking open.”

To resolve the issue of bike 

abandonment on campus, all 
bikes assumed to be abandoned 
will be tagged, photographed 
and a description will be 
logged. Bikes suspected to be 
abandoned, based on signs such 
as bent rims, deteriorated tires, 
rusted breaks or chain, will be 
tagged for future removal.

Beginning on May 15, tagged 

bikes will be collected and 
taken to a storage area where 
they will be kept for a 30 day 
period beginning with the 
first day of fall classes. The 
grounds department will be 
cutting locks to remove bikes, 
and students who have locks 
damaged will not be given 

compensation.

The 30 day period is provided 

for students who might want 
to collect bikes that they left 
behind. When this period ends, 
the bikes in holding will be 
removed.

Usable bikes left behind will 

be taken to the University’s 
Property Disposition or given 
to a program to be reused; the 
rest will be recycled for parts.

In addition to the problem 

of taking up space, abandoned 
bikes add difficulty to the work 
of grounds crews, who are 
responsible 
for 
maintaining 

campus space, Rapp wrote.

“The abandoned bikes not 

only look bad but they can make 
the maintenance of the area 
more difficult,” Rapp wrote.

Staff involved in the project 

said they encourage students 
to remove their bikes from 
campus when they leave for the 
summer or graduate.

“If they are unable to take 

their bike with them we would 
encourage them to find an 
alternative place to store the 
bike than on a campus bike 
rack. We want to make sure 
that the maximum number of 
racks are available for active 
bicyclists,” Rapp wrote.

Clinton.

“This is an important state 

for Hillary Clinton because 
she has a lot of strong support 
here,” she said. “We want to 
make sure we do our duties to 
get the grassroots support by 
reaching out and making sure 
they’ve heard from us because 
we know that is probably the 

most important part of any 
campaign.”

Sarkar added that Students 

for Hillary is currently working 
on organizing a joint event with 
Students for Sanders in the form 
of a policy discussion night, 
where panelists would discuss 
issues important to students 
including mental health, sexual 
assault on campus and college 
affordability.

Dingell 
said 
she 
greatly 

appreciates 
the 
efforts 
the 

students are making to support 

Clinton 
and 
expressed 
her 

willingness to help.

“I think your getting on the 

phone, talking as young people, 
telling them why you believe 
in her is really important,” 
she said. “You don’t know how 
much of a difference you make. 
Tell me what I need to do to 
help. I’ll do anything with you 
guys.”

LSA freshman, David Scharf, 

said he attended the phone 
bank to express his support.

“I’m 
very 
passionate 
for 

Hillary for America,” he said. 
“I just really want to help in 
whatever ways I can to ensure 
that Hillary is elected.”

As the March primary debate 

nears, Michigan is slated to see 
an increase in attention from 
both 
Clinton 
and 
Sanders. 

Clinton 
visited 
Flint 
last 

Sunday 
and 
her 
daughter 

Chelsea 
visited 
Thursday. 

Sanders will give a speech at 
Eastern Michigan University 
on Monday as well.

HGTV begins filming in A2

lecture series at Weiser on Feb. 13, 2016.

Home and Garden 

Television Visited, more 
commonly known as 
HGTV, has purchased a 
local property at 730 Spring 
Street for renovations and 
filming, according to The 
Ann Arbor News. The house 
lies within Ann Arbor’s 
popular west side Water Hill 
neighborhood.

HGTV is a home design 

and renovation channel, well 
known for its remodeling 
and makeover programs for 
homeowners. 

Late in 2015, HGTV 

issued handouts to 
residents in the Water Hill 
neighborhood to inform 
them of the upcoming 
development. The note was 
signed by Gary McCormick, 
director of corporate 

communications, marketing 
and communications for 
HGTV.

“If you are not already 

aware, HGTV has recently 
purchased the property at 
730 Spring Street, which will 
be featured in an upcoming 
HGTV program,” the note 
read. “Renovations will begin 
shortly on the home and be 
featured sometime in 2016.”

City records state the 

property was bought by 
Urban Retreat, LLC for 
$225,000 last October. 
According to permits filed 
with the City of Ann Arbor, 
the home will be redesigned 
by Ann Arbor-based Maven 
Development and Canton-
based architecture firm 
Studio Z Architecture.

Companies hired to 

work on the project are 
bound by non-disclosure 
agreements, and are unable 
to answer media inquiries 
about on-going construction. 
McCormick explained that 
HGTV will only release 
additional information when 
the project is announced to 
viewers. 

The two-bedroom, 

single-story property was 
built in 1925. A second story 
will be added, expanding the 
property from 840 to 1324 
square-feet, according to 
plans filed with the City of 
Ann Arbor. Also in the plans 
are an additional bathroom, 
powder room, skylights, 
a covered front porch and 
sliding glass doors to a back 
deck.

each particular song for the 
past two to three weeks.”

Indian classical music has 

developed 
over 
thousands 

of years. However today, it 
can be classified into two 
main 
styles— 
Hindustani, 

which originated in northern 
India and Carnatic, from 
southern 
India. 
Though 

these types of music use 
different instruments, they 
share a similar reliance on 
improvisation.

LSA 
senior 
and 

Sahana 
member 
Shruthi 

Subramaniam 
said 
the 

welcoming atmosphere of the 
group translates into how she 
and others perform.

“I’m a part of one of the 

group performances, so we 
have two vocalists and two 
flautists,” she said. “The 
organization as a whole is 
very open to all members 
so 
there’s 
no 
specific 

qualifications. But to perform 
on this kind of stage you have 
to audition with either the 
music or dance chair.”

Indian 
classical 
dance 

forms are rooted in the Natya 
Shastra, a treaty on Indian 
classical theatre which was 
authored by the Hindu Sage 
Bharatha around the first 
or third century C.E. The 
classical dance forms that 
were performed at Swaranjali 
included Kathak from the 
North and Bharathantyam 
from the South.

Though 
there 
are 

commonalities 
between 

the dances, the structures 
and the costumes worn by 
performers have evolved due 
to the differences in regions.

Along 
with 
seven 

performances, the concert 
also included a slide show 
dedicated to the graduating 
seniors to thank them and 
wish them luck for the future. 
The Sahana board said they 
were very appreciative for 
the strong audience turnout.

“We transitioned into a 

new board about a month 
back, so at the beginning of 
January we started working 
on 
preparations 
for 
the 

show,” Business sophomore 
Dhara Gosalia, the public 
relations chair for Sahana, 
said. 
“Along 
with 
social 

media and flyering around 
campus, 
we 
reached 
out 

to 
professors 
who 
teach 

something related to the 
South Asian performing arts. 
There are also local dance 
and classical music teachers 
who work with us and do 
workshops with us as well.”

Engineering 
senior 

Angelica Okorom said she 
enjoyed all of the different 
aspects of the performance.

“I think the show has 

been really good. I liked 
the performance with the 
dancers doing complimentary 
movements,” she said. “I also 
really enjoy listening to the 
unique instrumental pieces.”

of Ann Arbor resident Aura 
Rosser in 2014.

In 
a 
public 
forum 
on 

police-community 
relations 

in 
October 
2015, 
Baird 

emphasizedthat 
improving 

these 
relationships 
was 
a 

priority for his tenure as 
interim chief.

Baird joined AAPD in 1993, 

holding a number of positions 
within 
the 
department 

— 
including 
professional 

standards 
lieutenant 
and 

crisis response unit sergeant 
— before becoming deputy 
police chief in 2013.

Interim City Administrator 

Tom Crawford cited these 
experiences in a memo to 
City Council recommending 
Baird’s 
confirmation. 
City 

Council will need to approve 
the 
resolution 
confirming 

Baird’s appointment by simple 
majority.

In a Facebook post Friday, 

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor said he looked forward 
to working with Baird in his 
new capacity.

“I’ve very much enjoyed 

my work with Chief Baird 
over the past months and 
look forward to working with 
him to make Ann Arbor’s 
disciplined and professional 
police 
department 
even 

better,” Taylor wrote.

Neither Taylor nor Baird 

responded to requests for 
comment.

also to the leadership of the 
school.”

Co-President 
of 
the 

Marketing 
Club 
Kristin 

Horvath, a Business graduate 
student said using Nielsen 
data and these types of 
tools is something that most 
marketers learn once they’ve 
started working.

“We’re trying to bring that 

learning here so that Ross 
students have an advantage 
going into the workplace,” she 
said.

Business student Joseph 

Chaves, an active member of 
the Marketing Club, has had 
hands-on 
experience 
with 

Nielsen in a previous post at 
General Mills.

“I remember spending a 

significant amount of time 
over the first three or four 
weeks just walking interns 
through how the tool works 
— mostly the mechanics of it,” 
he said.

“They were able to decipher 

the findings but the actual 
mechanism by which you pull 
the data can be a little tricky. 
So I think the overall goal in 
what we see in the Marketing 
Lab really having a lot of 
benefits for students is the 
opportunity to — on day one 
of your internship — already 
have exposure to the tool, 
know how it works, know 
what the metrics mean, know 
how to pull things. So I think 
for Ross, the Marketing Lab 
having access to Nielsen can 
be a really big differentiator 
when it comes to preparing 
students to go into a career 
right in management. 

As of now, Horvath said, 

Marketing 
Club 
members 

are planning a curriculum 
through which MBA students 
can 
attend 
a 
four-night 

learning series to learn more 
about the Nielsen system.

“They are going through all 

of the different metrics, how 
to pull them, and then giving 
students a business taste that 
will be very similar to what 
they would make them do on 
the job,” she said.

Horvath 
also 
said 
the 

long-term goal is to expand 
the program. This expansion 
could include undergraduate 
Business students as well. 

“Right now it’s set up to be 

a little extracurricular,” she 
said. “That being said, we’re 
very open to the idea in the 
future of trying to incorporate 
it more into the curriculum. 
Once we’re through this pilot 
phase — working out all the 
bugs, making sure everything 
works well with the system — 
the goal is to open it up to the 
broader Ross community.”

Horvath added that access 

to the Nielsen data would give 
Business School students an 
opportunity different from 
any other MBA program.

“This 
development 

enhances the action-based 
learning 
opportunities 
for 

our students and also gives 
them more opportunities to 
develop 
analytical 
skills,” 

Horvath said. “It helps set 
us apart from other top-tier 
MBA programs because we 
are the only school to have 
access to the Nielsen Answers 
on Demand system.”

‘U’ researchers 
part of team 
to observe 
gravitational 
waves

Scientists observed 

gravitational waves for the first 
time last September, but have 
just recently made sense of what 
their equipment detected.

Astronomists concluded the 

waves were caused by two black 
holes merging in the distant 
universe long ago to create a 
larger, spinning black hole.

Both gravitational wave 

observatories, located in 
Lousianna and Washington 
state, were concieved and built 
by Caltech and MIT.

The discoverey also lends 

support to Albert Einstein’s 
general theory of relativity, 
which claims the curvature of 
spacetime is directly affected by 
the momentum and energy of 
whatever matter and radiation is 
present.

Astonomists claim the 

discoverey will open the door 
to an entirely new field of 
astronomy wherein researchers 
will be able to hear the universe.

University reseachers have 

been involved with the project 
since 1997.

Candidates claim 
Obama should not 
appoint new court 
justice

Following the death of 

Supreme Court Justice Antonin 
Scalia, Republican presidential 
candidates are claiming 
President Obama ought to 
refrain from appointing a new 
justice, according to The New 
York Times.

Scalia was found dead at a 

west-Texas resort Saturday 
morning, having suffered a heart 
attack.

Republican presidential 

candidates Donald Trump and 
Sen. Ted Cruz have each stated 
Obama should withhold his 
presidential power to seek a 
replacement, instead arguing the 
newly elected president should 
make that choice.

These candidates are 

concerned about how Obama’s 
choice could affect future court 
decisions.

Democratic presidential 

candidate Hilary Clinton said it 
was outrageous how Republicans 
were treating the situation.

Clinton also said the 

Republican Party’s behavior 
was out of step with the nation’s 
history and constitutional 
principles.

‘U’ suspends drone 
activity over Ann 
Arbor campus

The University announced 

Friday that it has temporarily 
banned the use of drones on or 
above campus property until 
a University regulatory policy 
for the devices is finalized. 
This ban prohibits drone use 
in all outdoor campus spaces 
and public indoor spaces on 
campus, but does not apply to 
drone testing and research areas, 
according to a press release.

In the release, University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said 
the ban is an attempt to curb 
future issues with the drones.

“As these types of devices 

continue to gain popularity and 
proliferate, and there is more 
and more of them out, we want 
to make sure that we have a safe 
environment for the University 
community,” Fitzgerald said. 
“Erring on the side of caution to 
give us some time to continue 
the work of developing a more 
comprehensive policy as well 
as a safe place to continue the 
research related to drones, we 
have put this temporary ban in 
place until we can continue that 
work.”

much and even hospital visits.

According to a working 

paper released by the National 
Bureau of Economic Research 
in December, another trend 
might also now be a part of the 
latter list: it shows research 
that links higher reports of 
rape on university campuses 
to Division I football game 
days across the country. Game 
days and tailgates, the report 
suggests, are an opportunity 
for increased partying and 
alcohol consumption, and that 
opportunity can be correlated 
to a rise in “daily reports of 
rape (to law enforcement) 
with 17-24 year old victims by 
28 percent.”

Study 
co-author 
Isaac 

Swensen, 
a 
professor 
at 

Montana 
State 
University, 

said in an interview that the 
results 
corresponded 
with 

data he and other co-authors 
previously collected.

“We’re 
certainly 

aware of all the evidence 
characterizing the partying 
on 
college 
campuses,” 
he 

said. 
“(Division 
I 
football 

games) provide an interesting 
opportunity to learn about the 
underlying causal effects of 
such activities.”

It’s no secret that partying, 

even heavy partying, occurs 
on game days nationwide, but 
the study goes a step further 
in estimating that “football 
games, both home and away, 
cause 253 to 770 additional 
rapes per year across the 128 
schools competing in Division 
1A football.” It also notes a 
spike in other alcohol-related 
crimes in addition to sexual 
assault, like DUIs, MIPs and 
public 
order 
offenses 
like 

disorderly conduct, when the 
home team wins an upset or 
has an exciting game.

Swensen noted that the 

official reports of rape the 
study is based on are often 
lower than the actual number 
of 
sexual 
assaults 
— 
the 

Department of Justice found 
in 2014 that only 20 percent 
of rapes are reported to the 
police. At the University of 
Michigan, only 3.6 percent 
of students who experience 
a 
nonconsensual 
sexual 

experience told an official.

Discrepancies 
also 
exist 

between the official statistics 
on rape the Department of 
Public Safety and Security, 
for example, reports in its 
annual security report, and 
the 172 incidents of sexual 
misconduct fielded this year 
by the Office of Institutional 
Equity. This is due to the fact 
that some instances classified 
as sexual misconduct in the 
OIE report fall outside the 
specific federal guidelines for 
sexual assault outlined by the 
Clery Act.

“(A) main interpretational 

challenge stems from the fact 
that we only observe reports 
of rape, and reports severely 
understate 
true 
incident 

rates,” the NBER report notes 
in discussing its results.

No hard data exists proving 

the study’s findings are true 
at the University. And because 
many game day activities take 
place off campus, it would be 
difficult for the University to 
strictly monitor spaces outside 
of the Big House. Research 
cited by SAPAC coordinator 
Kendal 
Rosalik 
does 
note 

that consumption raises the 
vulnerability of a victim — an 
intoxicated individual is more 
likely to perceive a potential 
partner as sexually available. 

“From our campus climate 

survey, we know alcohol is one 
of the primary contributors 

to 
incidents 
of 
sexual 

misconduct,” 
University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 
wrote in an e-mail to The 
Michigan Daily. “We also 
know that alcohol is an issue 
at most collegiate football 
games, including Michigan, 
and we have many efforts in 
place to address this including 
a comprehensive, evidence-
based approach on any high-
risk day.”

In response to the results, 

LSA senior Kendal Rosalik, 
a Sexual Assault Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 

co-coordinator, 
said 
he 

thought increased rates of 
alcohol consumption aren’t 
necessarily unique to game 
days.

“There are a lot of high-

risk 
events, 
communities 

and 
behaviors 
that 
aren’t 

necessarily specific to college 
game day,” she said. “I think 
you 
would 
see 
the 
same 

thing around Halloween, St. 
Patrick’s Day (and) Welcome 
Week.”

Several 
other 
students 

agreed with Rosalik and said 
they questioned the study’s 
validity in the context of 
game day on the University’s 
campus.

LSA 
freshman 
Aishu 

Chandrakanthan 
said 
she 

actually feels safer partying 
before or after games, as 
drinking often takes place 
in more open and well-lit 
settings. She views the day as 
more of a family affair, and 
one that often revolves around 
the actual football game.

“I’ve 
experienced 

discomfort, but more at bars 
compared to game days,” she 
said. “At game days, there’s 
parents there, and I feel like 
police and security is always 
around. And during nighttime 
parties, a guy can end up 
taking a girl home, but on 
game days, they’ll most likely 
end up going to the game.”

LSA 
senior 
Marlee 

Beckering, former president 
of the Delta Gamma sorority, 
agreed, pointing out the extra 
precaution her sorority sisters 
take on game days.

“People travel in packs, 

it’s daylight, they watch out 
for each other and they’re 
really accountable for where 
their 
friends 
and 
other 

students are,” she said. “In 
my experience, game days are 
a time people are watching 
out for each other a lot more. 
Although Greek tailgates are 
a lot busier, they’re also very 
monitored. The police will 
show up, or fraternities will 
hire private security.” 

Much 
of 
the 
scrutiny 

concerning game days does 
fall on Greek life, Beckering 
said, as fraternity houses are 
typically the traditional and 
well-known hosts of larger 
tailgates and parties. The 
University’s campus climate 
survey 
found 
members 
of 

Greek life were 2.5 times 
more likely than their non-
Greek peers to experience 
nonconsensual penetration.

Partially in response to 

these 
statistics, 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

rolled out an initiative to 
reform 
the 
party 
culture 

associated with Greek life 
earlier this academic year, 
mandating 
educational 

programs 
and 
increased 

dialogue with administration. 
All affiliated organizations 
were also required to send a 
member to SAPAC’s bystander 
intervention 
training 

program.

However, Beckering also 

noted 
the 
importance 
of 

recognizing Greek life as only 
a portion of the solution.

“Greek life is the epicenter 

of drinking and a lot of 
socializing and stereotypes, 
which I think we’re slowly 
breaking down,” she said. 
“When those things happen, 
it’s 
hard 
because 
they’re 

immediately attributed back 
to a certain culture or group.”

What many students and 

researchers alike do seem to 
agree on is the centrality of 
alcohol to sporting events 
in general, and the risks 
associated with it.

Katherine Redmond Brown, 

the president of the National 
Coalition 
Against 
Violent 

Athletes, said she thought the 
relationship between alcohol 
and sports was at the heart 
of the fight to prevent sexual 
assault.

“Football and alcohol and 

partying are all intertwined 
together,” 
she 
said. 
“You 

look 
anywhere, 
at 
the 

advertisements or to college 
coaches on radio talk shows, 
and it’s sponsored by alcohol.”

On the University’s campus, 

administrators and students 
alike are making efforts to 
turn the tide, though. With the 
“I Will” campaign — aimed at 
increasing awareness of sexual 
assault on campus — and 
two campus climate surveys 
seeking data on sexual assault, 
the University has pushed 
for increased awareness on 
campus in past years. It’s also 
begun a process to revise its 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy. 

SAPAC has been a major part 
of the initiative as well, as it 
continues to lead Relationship 
Remix 
workshops 
for 
all 

freshman in residence halls, 
which include facts on safe 
sex and definitions of consent. 
This has all occurred amid 
an investigation started in 
2014 
by 
the 
Department 

of Education into how the 
University 
handles 
sexual 

assault, 
one 
of 
multiple 

investigations 
occurring 

nationwide.

In their annual report, OIE 

cited increased awareness of 
the sexual misconduct policy 
and educational efforts on 
campus as an explanation for 
a 33 percent spike in sexual 
misconduct reports this year.

Rosalik said she would place 

the University at the national 
forefront of college campuses 
improving 
awareness, 
but 

there is still more work to be 
done. She recounted positive 
encouragement from students 
while 
tabling 
a 
SAPAC 

informational booth on what 
happened to also be a game 
day.

“People were yelling like, 

‘Oh my gosh I love consent!’ 
and they were excited, and 
it was a game day,” she said. 
“There’s definitely awareness 
that this is an important issue. 
At the same time, 89 percent 
of first-year students went 
through Relationship Remix 
this year which is super cool, 
but there’s no next step to 
that, or a way to build off of 
that. Our University is one of 
the schools doing the most in 
this work … but that doesn’t 
mean we don’t have more to 
do.” 

Football games may not be an 

isolable, or easily controllable, 
contributor to sexual assault, 
but Chandrakanthan agreed 
that she was still surprised by 
the party culture, both on and 
off game days. 

“I didn’t expect it to be so 

intense, or that guys would 
be so handsy,” she said. “I’ve 
seen guys get very aggressive 
or try and use their influence 
from other organizations on 
campus. I wasn’t prepared for 
that.”

T

he tangerine sun shone 
bright that evening, as 
beads of sweat streamed 

down my back. It 
was week two of 
our Global Ini-
tiative trip here 
in India, and the 
only thing left 
for this rather 
torrid day was a 
cultural visit to 
a Hindu Temple 
— 
Kapaleesh-

warar 
Temple, 

in Mylapore. I’ll 
be frank: In this 
group of eager, curious people, I 
did not share that particular sen-
timent. I was not a follower; I had 
been to enough temples in my life. 
My back had a growing dull pain, 
and I just wanted to lie down. 
Alas, it wasn’t up to me, so into the 
temple I went. I entered through 
the large Dravidian-style gate — a 
gopuram in the Tamil tongue — and 
I did my trained bow of respect. As 
I stood there, staring into famil-
iar, unblinking eyes, I felt an urge 
concerning something I thought I 
had misplaced and lost a long while 
back. The sun grew warmer, the 
noise denser and all I wanted to do 
was pray.

Every childhood morning, I 

woke up to the sounds of my father 
praying and the scent of incense 
sticks that oddly always smelled 
slightly differently than they had 
the previous day. I’d end the day 
silently reciting chants, completely 
unaware of the Vedic phrases I was 
speaking, simply aware that I felt 
better saying them. My parents 
took me and my younger brother 
to many temples, often against our 
admittedly childish wills. This 
was one of those instances where 
I did not take kindly to parents’ 
blatant veto power over their chil-
dren. True, most temples were the 
awe-inspiring, chaotic sanctuaries 
for the tired and the devout, but I 
wasn’t that kind of tired and I cer-

tainly wasn’t devout. But I went 
because I was told, and I believed 
because I was told.

Before long, the nightly recita-

tions stopped. Schoolwork became 
increasingly difficult; I had to think 
about college and what I should 
and wanted to study. More impor-
tant things started coming up and 
I didn’t have the enough hours or 
mental stamina to consider reli-
gion. The sanctuary had gotten a 
little too chaotic. Losing this part 
of my routine wasn’t intentional or 
rebellious, but rather more unspec-
tacular. As I got exposed to differ-
ent personal hypotheses and was in 
my journey to find what was worth 
holding onto, faith seemed a tad too 
weighty. It was one of my extrinsic 
properties that didn’t make the cut.

This is what makes that humid, 

humid evening in Chennai feel so 
dissonant. That urge seemed so 
unreal, so much so that I had no 
semblance of an idea of how to 
deal with it.

Could it have been guilt? I don’t 

think so. I didn’t feel an intense 
constraint because of my religion. 
Yes, my parents might have forced 
me to participate, but never to 
think like them. I think they did 
this because it was our heritage — 
it was tradition. They did it because 

their parents did it and because 
they always did it and because they 
chose to do it. Moreover, I think 
that they wanted their eldest to at 
least be aware of this culture, that 
they believed it was an utter shame 
to have a child grow up and be 
unappreciative and unknowing of a 

tradition larger and more wondrous 
than any one of us could imagine.

But truthfully, I think the rea-

son I encountered that urge to 
pray was dependent on that par-
ticular situation. It was a hectic few 
weeks, there were no familiar faces 
around, I was getting no sleep and 
my body ached all the time. In this 
sea of vulnerability, prayer seemed 
like a solace. It was safe and famil-
iar, like nothing bad would ever 
happen to me here. I remember 
holding out my strained arm so that 
I could touch the ceremonial fire 
that was being passed around. I felt 
a warmth that I had long forgotten, 
a warmth of rare reassurance. A 
feeling that I was all right and that 
everything was going to be OK.

So did I rediscover God? No, I 

don’t think I ever really believed 
in the first place. Fine, then did I 
find God? Not really. I still don’t 
believe religion is my personal 
calling. But I think, at the time, I 
needed help, and prayer was the 
answer. So now would I at least 
pray every night? Probably not, 
but I’m not going to outright deny 
it as a possibility. Perhaps of more 
overall importance, is the fact that 
I believe I found myself, or at least 
a part I had buried. I found the 
little, chubby boy who had once 
prayed before bed. It was a singu-
lar moment of a vague, yet resolute 
sense of being connected to the 
person I once was.

Thus, in a final consideration, 

does this mean something? The 
answer is what it was always going 
to be: not necessarily. I doubt I will 
now live a life dedicated to serving 
or searching for something higher 
and unseen. As it happens, this 
was not some life-altering moment 
of significance. I did not find some 
shiny, new personal truth, rather, I 
was simply reminded of an old one. 
And, sometimes, that’s just what we 
need.

P

olitical tensions were high on June 
28, 2012. All eyes were fixed on the 
Supreme Court, where the constitu-

tionality of Obamacare 
and its individual man-
date would be decided 
by the nine most influen-
tial judicial minds in the 
country. The cornerstone 
of the president’s legacy, 
the historical legacy of the 
Court and the health care 
of millions of Americans 
were on the line. It was at 
this moment that Justice 
Scalia saw an opportunity 
to work the audience, ask-
ing one of the attorneys, “What happened to 
the Eighth Amendment? You really want us 
to go through these 2,700 pages?” implying 
that to read the entire law would be cruel and 
unusual punishment. This humor and levity 
will be sorely missed with the passing of the 
Supreme Court’s conservative anchor.

The vacancy left by the 79-year-old jurist 

Saturday morning has thrown the political 
world into chaos; President Obama has prom-
ised to nominate a replacement, while Mitch 
McConnell and the GOP-controlled Senate 
plan to block any confirmation before the 
next administration. Meanwhile, three cur-
rent presidential candidates sit in the Senate 
and will cast a vote on a nominee who would 
otherwise be theirs. Political pundits and 
journalists are calling Scalia’s death a monu-
mental loss for conservatives, and liberals 
will inevitably see this as 
an opportunity to push 
the Supreme Court left-
ward. As a liberal, how-
ever, I would like to take 
this opportunity to mourn 
the loss of a brilliant legal 
mind 
and 
his 
unique 

brand of conservatism.

It may be difficult for 

liberals, who have long 
painted Scalia as the judi-
cial equivalent of Archie 
Bunker, to reconcile their beliefs with his 
textualism. But this is a lazy oversimplifi-
cation of one of the most brilliant lawyers 
of the 21st century. Though rare, Scalia had 
his liberal moments over the course of three 
decades on the bench. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 
he railed against the Bush administration’s 
suspension of habeas corpus and its treat-
ment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. He 
consistently sided with the liberal justices in 
cases involving law enforcement and the pro-
tections of the Fourth Amendment. Perhaps 
most importantly, he cast the deciding vote in 
Texas v. Johnson, invalidating a law against 
flag burning and upholding a patently liberal 
interpretation of the right to free speech.

Though a hero to the political right, Sca-

lia exemplified professionalism and a refined 
political discourse, separating a person from 
their beliefs. By liberal and conservative col-
leagues alike, he was affectionately referred 
to as “Nino,” and known as much for his love 
of opera as for his infectious laugh. Perhaps 
most famous was his long friendship with 
ideological opposite Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
who once said of Scalia, “I disagreed with 
most of what he said, but I loved the way he 
said it.” His response: “What’s not to like — 
except her views on the law.”

Beyond the camaraderie and respect he 

showed for his intellectual adversaries, Scalia 
presented a compelling view of what a judge 
should be. “We don’t sit here to make the 
law, to decide who ought to win. We decide 
who wins under the law that the people have 
adopted. And very often, if you’re a good 
judge, you don’t really like the result you’re 
reaching.” In his opinions, he quoted Sesame 
Street and Shakespeare. He called an argu-
ment “pure applesauce” and responded to a 
reporter with a Sicilian gesture synonymous 
with profanity. There may never be a justice 
as colorful as Antonin Scalia.

Even if one cannot appreciate the person-

ality and flair he added to the high court, 
liberals should commemorate the ways in 
which Scalia’s conservatism helped refine 
their beliefs. Where would the concept of 
a “living” Constitution be if it had not been 
crafted in response to the emergence of 
originalist jurisprudence?

And that’s what needs to be appreciated 

about Justice Scalia. In stark contrast with 
the fear-mongering brand of conservatism 
that runs rampant today, full of platitudes 
about American values and radicalism, Sca-
lia based his philosophy on the Constitution. 
He based it in irrefutable text and extensive 
research into what the Founding Fathers 
were thinking when they put pen to paper.

Disagreeing with “conservatives” like 

Donald Trump and Ted Cruz is easy. Drum-
ming up an argument against a wall on 
the Mexican border, anti-Muslim rhetoric, 
ostentatious foreign policy or disparag-

ing women is easy. What 
is infinitely harder is 
to read Scalia’s defense 
of Second Amendment 
rights 
in 
District 
of 

Columbia v. Heller and 
figure out why you dis-
agree with it. To piece 
apart his dissents on 
Obamacare and same-sex 
marriage is to investigate 
what it means to be a lib-
eral and how the Consti-

tution not only factors in, but also dictates 
the rhetoric of the American left.

I believe in a “living” Constitution. I look 

at the vast majority of Scalia’s career and my 
brow furrows in disagreement as his bril-
liant prose takes aim at my core beliefs — 
from affirmative action to a woman’s right 
to choose and everything in between. Nine 
times out of 10, I will disagree. But 10 times 
out of 10, I will be challenged and will walk 
away a better liberal for the experience.

In this hyper-politicized climate, Antonin 

Scalia’s passing will be framed in terms of 
winners and losers. Will Obama be the first 
president since Reagan to succeed in nam-
ing three Supreme Court justices? Which 
candidates will get a bump in the polls as 
a result of their support or opposition dur-
ing the nominating process? Can the Sen-
ate GOP hold out for 11 months? Ultimately, 
though, there are no winners. Conserva-
tives lost their champion, and liberals lost 
the man who represented reasonable oppo-
sition and, maybe more than anyone else, 
helped define the constitutional debates of 
the past 30 years.

Liberals, mourn Scalia

O

bjectivity is in many ways 
a myth — but this isn’t a 
novel thought. I think we 

all accept that 
no one can be 
truly objective 
in 
how 
they 

view a situa-
tion. But our 
lack of objec-
tivity goes even 
deeper 
since 

worldview 
is 

continually 
influenced 
by 

environment.

Peer 
pres-

sure is one of the most powerful 
of environmental pressures — so 
powerful, in fact, that it can liter-
ally change what we see. Solomon 
Asch famously put subjects in a 
room with a number of confeder-
ates who, as a group, were asked to 
compare the length of two differ-
ent-sized lines. The confederates 
claimed that the two lines were of 
equal length despite being obvi-
ously different. In many cases, the 
subjects gave in and agreed that 
the two lines were of the same 
length. Peer pressure is not the 
only environmental factor which 
prevents objectivity but it is a 
potent example.

Historically, our belief in objec-

tivity has been used to manipulate 
the public. Because the sciences 
drape themselves in objectivity, 
we place a lot of trust in scien-
tists. These researchers can have 
a profit incentive that leads them 
to abuse this trust. One classic 
example of this is the implementa-
tion of the electric chair. The state 
of New York was trying to find 
the best way to execute criminals 
via the electric chair, and Thomas 

Edison famously advocated for 
inmates to be electrocuted by way 
of the alternating current. Why? 
Edison was trying to expand the 
reach of direct current technol-
ogy and thought that an electric 
chair powered by the alternating 
current would scare the public 
away from his competitor (despite 
its not being any more dangerous 
than direct current electricity). 
Here, we see that our belief in 
objectivity can be turned against 
us and prevent us from realizing 
an objective truth.

This lack of objectivity goes fur-

ther; it permeates deep into our 
very language. Scientific terms are 
often viewed as monolithic and 
all-encompassing. This is not the 
case. Consider the commonly given 

definition of the word “species”: an 
organism that can breed and whose 
offspring can have kids. But there 
are significant exceptions to this 
definition. That isn’t to throw this 
definition out the window, but to 
complicate it and recognize how 
even with science, a unified truth 
doesn’t exist.

This 
definitional 
diversity 

extends beyond the hard science 
to every aspect of our lives. If 
you were to ask 30 people about 
the definition of capitalism, you 

would get 30 different responses. 
Each one will emphasize different 
aspects of capitalism: its capacity 
to create growth or inequality; its 
focus on markets and deregula-
tion, etc. While everyone has the 
same approximate definition, the 
specifics will always be muddled. 
To borrow from Supreme Court 
Justice Potter Stewart: I shall not 
attempt define capitalism, but “I 
know it when I see it.”

Each 
individual’s 
definition 

comes from their own political 
location. Even if we were to turn to 
a dictionary, capitalism’s meaning 
would still be elusive. Merriam-
Webster has a distinct geopolitical 
location: it’s made in the United 
States, a liberal, western, demo-
cratic, capitalist country. If we 
were to compare that definition 
to one which originated from the 
U.S.S.R., Iran or Norway, there 
would be a bevy of differences. 
This isn’t to elevate one over the 
other, but to recognize the validity 
and multiplicity of perspectives; a 
singular objective truth is nearly 
impossible to find.

The lesson here is one of skep-

ticism. We should recognize that 
nearly everything is bent by our 
human perceptions, society or out-
side interests, and thus not truly 
objective. Whenever we encounter 
a new idea, we should approach it 
with a modicum of disbelief: Who 
is making the claim and how did 
they come to their conclusion? 
By synthesizing this skepticism 
with the claims we face every day 
and our own beliefs, we can come 
closer to creating a comprehensive 
perspective.

20TH CENTURY FOX

Strut like you mean it.

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds, 

“The Proposal”) is perhaps 
Marvel 
Comics’ 
most 

memorable 
character 
of 

the ’90s, and 
he sometimes 
feels 
like 
a 

time capsule of 
that 
decade’s 

pop 
culture. 

His 
stories 

are 
self-

referential, 
ultraviolent 
and filled to the brim with 
the 
same 
skateboard-riding, 

backwards hat-sporting ‘tude 
that filled the era’s music 
videos 
and 
professional 

wrestling 
shows. 
Lately, 

though, his books have felt a bit 
dated — the chimichanga jokes 
have been getting a bit tired, 
and the fourth-wall-breaking 
metahumor has, at this point, 
been done better elsewhere.

Thankfully, 
20th 
Century 

Fox and Reynolds’s long-in-
the-making superhero vehicle 
provides a nice update to a 
character on the verge of feeling 
passé. “Deadpool” is a comedy 
surprisingly on the pulse of 
contemporary 
geek 
culture, 

gleefully satirizing the nine-
figure grossing comic book 
films that have skyrocketed 
Disney and Marvel to the 
forefront of the film zeitgeist. 
While he’s killing the bad guys, 
Deadpool loves to spit one-liners 
and make fun of superhero 
tropes. No pop culture is safe 
here — from digs at Reynolds’ 
terrible 2011 “Green Lantern” 
film to a particularly nasty 
“127 Hours” meets Judy Blume 
joke (yeah, I’m not going to try 
to explain that one here — just 
see the movie), “Deadpool” ’s 
referential satire is refreshingly 
on point.

But it isn’t purely a comedy. 

“Deadpool” 
is 
a 
decent 

comic-book 
origin 
story 

sandwiched between two huge, 
extraordinarily 
entertaining 

action scenes. Reynolds is a 
superb Wade Wilson, a lowlife 
gun-for-hire with a heart of gold, 
who falls for Vanessa (Morena 
Baccarin, “Homeland”), a sassy 
but endearing prostitute. The 
two fall into a superficial but 
still rather sweet romance (via 

one of the better meet cutes I’ve 
seen lately), which is promptly 
interrupted by some bad news 
for Wade — he’s diagnosed with 
terminal cancer.

We don’t quite get enough 

time with the two to really 
care about their relationship, 
but we get the point. He loves 
her, he’s going to die and he 
needs to cure himself so he 
can be with her. Wade makes 
a deal with the devil: he’s 
deceived by the Machiavellian 
Ajax (the Jai Courtney-esque 
Ed Skrein, “The Transporter 
Refueled”) into undergoing a 
brutal mutation treatment. He’s 
cured, and given Wolverine-like 
mutant powers to boot — but 
his features are deformed, he’s 
brainwashed and left for dead. 
Deadpool is born, and he’s out 
for revenge.

That 
last 
part 
probably 

sounds pretty familiar, huh? 
For all its innovation as a piece 
of satire (I’ll be spoiling none 
of its jokes here), “Deadpool” 
doesn’t nail the formal meat-
and-potatoes stuff of being 
a 
good 
superhero 
movie. 

Skrein’s Ajax continues the 
long tradition of lame, one-
dimensional supervillains that 
plague the Loki-less Marvel 
films. Vanessa is an initially 
interesting foil for Wade, but 
she’s quickly packed away into 
a damsel-in-distress box and 
isn’t really given space to feel 
interesting again. Perhaps most 
obnoxiously, mutants Colossus 
(Stefan Kapicic, “24”) and the 
insufferable Negasonic Teenage 
Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand, 
“Annie 
Undocumented”) 
are 

shoehorned into the otherwise 
excellent fight scenes for no 
perceivable reason other than to 
promote the upcoming “X-Men” 
film.

But where “Deadpool” fails 

as a straightforward superhero 
movie, it more than makes up 
for in its subversive humor, 
and 
its 
performance 
from 

Reynolds. This is by far the 
most impressive work, comedic 
or dramatic, that Reynolds has 
done. His razor-sharp cadence 
and bravado carry this film 
even when it’s on its most tired 
dregs in the second act. He’s 
dropping six jokes a minute, and 
the majority of them hit hard. 
T.J. Miller (“Silicon Valley”), 
essentially playing himself, is 
another highlight as Deadpool’s 

confidante Weasel, a smarmy 
hipster who somehow ended up 
as the proprietor of the tough-
guy bar where ‘pool hangs out.

“Deadpool” is at its best when 

it’s poking and prodding the 
lurching Kevin Feige-shaped 
blob of the “other” Marvel 
Comics movies, and isn’t quite 
as competent at standing freely 
as its own superhero film. But 
with the exception of a few 
unfortunate clunkers (there’s a 
pretty transphobic joke or two 
in there, ugh), “Deadpool” ‘s 
innovative, hilarious comedy is 
more than enough to justify the 
trip to the theater.

Stay until the end of the 

credits. If you’ve been paying 
attention, I shouldn’t have to 
tell you why. 

‘Deadpool’ excels 
with odd humor

‘Sparkler’ a success

By 
MARIA 
ROBINS-SOM-

MERVILLE

Daily Arts Writer

“I think it’s important to find 

out first, are you one of two writ-
ers? Do you write what you know 
or are you just a vivid imaginer 
— or are you some sort of com-
bination of both?” said Amber 
Tamblyn in a phone interview 
with The Michigan Daily.

The actress and poet’s most 

recent book of poems, “Dark 
Sparkler,” 
strikes 
a 
balance 

between 
Tamblyn’s 
familiar 

and imagined world. The col-
lection focuses on the untimely 
deaths of female actresses from 
the iconic Marilyn Monroe, to 
actresses whose names war-
rant few results from a Google 
search.

“It’s such an interesting topic 

to me — how we immortalize 
celebrities and glamorize them 
after they’re dead and sort of 
treat them like objects and so I 
wanted to give a voice to female 
actresses because I am one. I 
have some sense of what that 
loneliness and life must have 
been like,” she said.

Tamblyn has intimate knowl-

edge of the way that the world 
regards young female actresses. 
Having risen to success in roles 
in “General Hospital” and “Sis-
terhood of the Traveling Pants” 
(a piece of her identity that may 
resonate deeply with the tween 
hearts of University of Michigan 
students) she meditates on the 
destructive nature of fame on 
the psyches and habits of young 
starlets through poetry.

Tamblyn read from “Dark 

Sparkler” on Saturday at Lite-
rati Bookstore in Ann Arbor. Her 
reading was punctuated by can-
dor and hints of dark humor. She 

offered the audience a healthy 
dose of hugs, selfies, feminism 
and her two cents on sexist cri-
tiques of Hillary Clinton.

She discussed her process 

of writing “Dark Sparkler” as 
emotionally taxing. She start-
ed working on the collection 
in 2009 following the death of 
“Clueless” actress Brittany Mur-
phy, and she worked on it for six 
years with a one-year hiatus in 
between. Tamblyn joked about 
taking a year off, suggesting that 
there were a lot of things from 
which audience members likely 
hoped to take a year-long break.

“Can we just get a year off of 

the patriarchy? Y’all can come 
back and swing your dicks 
around — just give us a year off,” 
she said. I laughed — she knew 
her crowd. 

Her experience as a young 

actress is supplemented by a life-
time of writing poetry and expo-
sure to influential female poets 
such as Claudia Rankine, Wanda 
Coleman, Diane Di Prima and 
Marie Howe, all of whom have 
done extensive writing on what 
it means to be a woman.

“She (Wanda Coleman) cer-

tainly wrote about the dark-
est parts of being a woman and 
her mind could go to really 
dark morbid tough places about 
soul-searching and connecting 
herself with the souls of other 
women, so that really influenced 
me,” Tamblyn said.

Tamblyn still has the clear 

and versatile voice of a seasoned 
actress, from precise enuncia-
tion and a style that inflicts dis-
tinct emotional undertones to 
each poem she reads.

Her dark humor is displayed 

in the naturalistic slant rhymes 
in “Untitled Actress” in the 
lines, “Straight teeth a must, 

Must be flexible. Small bust a 
plus. Can do own stunts. Will 
waive rights to image, likeness, 
publicity and final cut.”

Other moments in the col-

lection are more whimsical and 
abstract. The poem entitled 
“Laurel Gene,” from which the 
title “Dark Sparkler” is pulled 
has a few lines that resonate 
deeply within the larger scope 
of the book. Tamblyn writes, “I 
was his dark sparkler. A taran-
tula on fire. / An innocent with 
apple juice eyes and a/ brain full 
of famished birds.” She recog-
nizes a life that is powerful, yet 
volatile and vulnerable.

Amid the recounting of sto-

ries outside of Tamblyn’s own, 
she anticipates a search for her 
personal stake in the matter. 
She included an epilogue to the 
book, that catalogues her pro-
cess of creating “Dark Sparkler” 
through lists, Google searches, 
emails and narratives of her own 
experience generated from a 
good portion of life spent in the 
limelight.

“My editor there was really 

adamant that people were going 
to want to know what it was like 
to be me while I was writing 
those poems. People were going 
to want that meta-experience,” 
Tamblyn said.

The directly personal por-

tion of the book is a point of both 
angst and pride.

“I was proud of that because 

I meditated on it for a long time 
and I kicked and screamed psy-
chologically like a little kid. 
I threw an internal tantrum 
because really, I didn’t want to 
go back over all of the emails and 
the notes I took over five years,” 
she said.

f God were fair and the 
universe were just, Megan 
Fox wouldn’t be funny.

Megan Fox doesn’t need to be 

funny. She is a lot of other things — 
the pouty 
face 
on 

a 
poster 

arranged 
conspicu-
ously 
across 
from 
a 

freshman 
boy’s bed, 
the 
kind 

of 
girl 

who 
has 

“always gotten along better with 
guys” and who gets lower-back tat-
toos as a “form of self-expression.” 
She’s the star of such renowned 
films 
as 
“Transformers” 
and 

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” 
the benefactor of an acting career 
funded by gross bros who will 
pay to stare at her ass while she 
washes a car. It even feels wrong 
referring to her without both her 
first and last name — you need two 
words to encompass the mythic 
sex symbolism that she embodies. 
And ever since she burst onto the 
scene in 2007 (out of nowhere, as 
if she were created in some sex-bot 
science lab), Megan Fox has been 
the one exception to my otherwise 
stringent feminism, the one lady 
I’d bash with utter glee.

Megan Fox has made a few 

forays into comedy in the past, 
which seems natural, because 
there is nothing funnier than a 
Hot Girl who stands there looking 
Hot. 
Megan 
Fox’s 
extensive 

filmography includes a cameo 
in Sacha Baron Cohen’s “The 
Dictator” and a supporting role in 
“This is 40.” Her standout scene 
in “This is 40” involves taking off 
her clothes during a shift at the 
clothing store where Leslie Mann’s 
character also works. Her best joke 
is standing there in her push-up 
bra and underwear, apathetically 
saying “really?” when Mann tells 
her she has a great body. Evidently, 
someone like Megan Fox doesn’t 
have to be funny or talented to 
make millions of dollars starring 
in action or comedy films. She is 
beautiful, which is all you need 

to be successful as a woman in 
Hollywood.

I feel kind of guilty about 

disliking Megan Fox this much, 
especially since I haven’t seen 
“Jennifer’s 
Body,” 
the 
Diablo 

Cody-penned horror comedy that 
Megan Fox headlined in 2009. 
In the movie, she plays another 
untouchable 
Hot 
Girl 
whose 

toxic good looks belie demonic 
possession. She kills a bunch of 
high-school boys. It sounds like 
exactly the kind of absurd satire 
that might speak to Megan Fox’s 
actual talent and reveal her merits 
aside from nice boobs — of course, 
I never wanted to see this movie, 
because it’s easier to just go on 
hating Megan Fox.

You can imagine the distaste 

I felt upon seeing the news that 
Megan Fox would be guest starring 
on one of my favorite comedies, 
“New Girl.” While star Zooey 
Deschanel was on maternity leave, 
Megan Fox would move into the 
schlubby L.A. loft with Nick, 
Schmidt and Winston. There’s 
already a TV show about a hot girl 
who lives with dorky guys, and 
it’s the highest-rated comedy on 
television: “The Big Bang Theory.” 
When “New Girl” premiered five 
years ago, I was worried that the 
show would follow in the steps 
of “Big Bang” and rely on cheap 
jokes about Hot Girls and dweeby 
guys, but Jess Day was always 
drawn with far more nuance and 
generous quirk than Penny on 
“The Big Bang Theory.” With the 
Megan Fox announcement, my 
fears were renewed. I was afraid 
that “New Girl” would lose its 
sense of humor and deliver the 
lazy, 
Hot-Girl-Standing-In-Her-

Underwear comedy that Megan 
Fox seems so adept at.

***
It turns out that Megan Fox 

is adept at a lot of other kinds 
of comedy as well. In “New 
Girl,” she plays Reagan, a tough 
pharmaceutical 
saleswoman 

that Nick and Schmidt meet at a 
doctor’s office. Upon seeing her 
for the first time, Nick is struck by 
the kind of “magic” he has been 
waiting for in a woman — you 
know, that spark of chemistry and 
immediate connection, that kind 

of love at first sight that’s possible 
with women who look like Megan 
Fox. Reagan is looking for a place 
to stay, and Nick is thrilled at the 
possibility of such a Hot Girl living 
with them.

But Reagan is hardly a fantasy. 

She’s cold and kind of a diva (one 
of her sublet conditions is that the 
 

bathroom has a rain shower), and 
she knows how to get what she 
wants (Nick installs a rain shower 
for her). She has a romantic history 
with Cece, one fateful hook-up at 
the MTV Beach House a decade 
ago that freaks the roommates 
out a little bit. She’s way, way 
out of Nick’s league, and all his 
friends let him know, repeatedly. 
And she has a deadpan sense of 
humor that’s miles from Jess’s 
bubbly sincerity. Reagan may be 
a purveyor of romantic “magic,” 
but she’s also kind of psychic and 
weird, and somehow knows that 
Schmidt used to be fat. She pours 
Nick the best Old Fashioned he’d 
ever tasted, and disappears from 
the bar without paying for a drink. 
She’s ephemeral, but she’s no 
dream Hot Girl in a softcore poster.

***
If God were fair and the universe 

were just, Megan Fox wouldn’t be 
funny. But the universe doesn’t 
bless women with just one talent, 
so here we are, surprised by a 
woman who is both gorgeous and 
silly. I’m embarrassed at those nine 
years I spent irrationally loathing 
someone who was never given a 
chance to show off her looks and 
comedic timing, the same kind 
of chance that someone like Zac 
Efron gets almost immediately 
upon arriving in Hollywood. It’s 
a shame that her comedic talent 
has been so obscured by years of 
underwritten roles that reduce 
her to some flat sex symbol. Even 
though she’s only on “New Girl” 
for another few weeks, I’m hoping 
that the show will start a grand 
Megan Fox career revival. She can 
tell a joke with the best of them.

Hairstyles straight out of Yeezy Season 3.

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

The blockbuster game has 

changed since “Avatar” came 
out. In the span of almost 
an entire presidency, we’ve 
observed the meteoric rise of 
the Marvel cinematic universe, 
the domination of the box office 
by young adult sci-fi mega-
franchises like The Hunger 
Games, 
Divergent 
and 
The 

Maze Runner, a whole new 
trilogy of “Lord of the Rings” 
films and the return of Star 
Wars as not just another film 
in the series but basically an 
entire entertainment industry 
of its own.

It seems like no one really 

cares about “Avatar” anymore. 
Most people have left it behind 
as a fun afternoon they spent 
with dumb plastic glasses on 
at the theater, while others 
have joined the recent wave of 
backlash against it. “It’s just 
like Pocahontas,” they say. “The 
plot is so dumb.” “It’s just like 
Dances with Wolves.” “You 
can’t remember a single line of 
dialogue from it.” “It’s Just like 
FernGully.” We hear the same 
criticisms over and over.

It’s been tough to be an 

“Avatar” apologist over the 
last few weeks (while I agree 
the film’s ideology is certainly 
far from complex, I still think 
it’s one of the best action 
movies 
of 
the 
millennium 

and a tremendous example of 
cinematic world-building). The 
backlash hit fever pitch a few 
weeks ago, when Fox announced 
that “Avatar 2” would be delayed 

until 2018 to avoid competition 
with “Star Wars Episode VIII,” 
which had recently been moved 
into the December 2017 slot to 
accommodate a script rewrite.

“My 
God!” 
one 
IGN 

commenter wrote. “By the time 
(Cameron) releases this movie 
either: a) no one will care b) 
everyone will have forgotten 
Avatar was even a thing (from 
seven years ago by the way).”

“If there was ever a movie 

that does not need a sequel 
it’s Avatar,” wrote another. 
“Cameron you are a better 
filmmaker 
than 
this. 
Do 

something else!!”

This is a cycle we’ve been 

through. Actually, we’ve been 
through it several times already: 
20th Century Fox announces 
a new James Cameron film. It 
goes way over budget. The hate 
comes pouring in. Everyone 
says that THIS is the film 
that’s going to ruin Cameron’s 
career. The film comes out. 
It’s critically acclaimed, and it 
makes more money than a small 
country’s GDP. Then another 
Cameron film is announced a 
few years later, and it begins 
again.

“Titanic” 
was 
expected 

to bomb. When analysts and 
critics heard that Cameron 
was creating a 90 percent scale 
model of the infamous ship, 
they 
laughed 
and 
laughed. 

No one had spent this much 
money on a movie before, and 
on Cameron’s obsessive little 
pet project about a shipwreck? 
There’s 
no 
way 
that 
will 

resonate with people.

I know this is an article, but 

I bet you can still hear my eyes 
rolling so hard they hit the back 
of my head.

“Avatar” was also expected 

to bomb. Go back and look 
— people were throwing so 
much shade prior to the film’s 
December 2009 release. It’s 
just the nature of the Internet 
— if it’s not clearly a calculated 
rehash of something fanboys 
already like, it’s going to fail.

Both movies killed it, to say 

the very least. In case you’ve 
been living in a sunken ship 
or on a far-off planet for the 
last few decades, “Titanic” 
and “Avatar” are the top two 
highest-grossing films of all 
time. Why do we keep doubting 
Cameron when literally every 
time he tries, his team puts 
out something that’s a smash 
cultural hit?

“Avatar 2” will be huge. The 

“Avatar” sequel trilogy will be 
as celebrated as the original 
“Lord of the Rings” trilogy, 
will advance film tech by years, 
and will make an absolutely 
stupid amount of money. If 
you’re rolling your eyes at this 
article and already typing out 
an incensed response, consider 
that you might just be acting 
like the people who were wrong 
about “Avatar.” And “Titanic.” 
And 
“Terminator 
2.” 
And 

“Aliens.”

I’m just saying, we’ve been 

here before, and we’ve been 
wrong every time. Cameron 
and his team are the best 
blockbuster filmmakers in the 
business. Hindsight is indeed 
20/20, but let’s try to use some 
foresight this time.

You can be the king but watch the queen conquer.

Feminism comes to 
late-night with Bee

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Samantha 
Bee 
pulls 
no 

punches in the premiere of her 
new TBS late-night on Mondays.

The 
cold 

open of “Full-
Frontal” is a 
sketch in which 
reporters 
ask 

Bee questions 
on 
how 
she 

will be able to 
do things, like 
host 
a 
late-

night 
show, 

specifically as 
a woman. As 
she is the lone 
female host of 
a 
late-night, 

Bee must have 
thought it was 
an 
important 

question 
to 

answer right away. She answers 
sweetly, making a joke about 
needing “a little bit of magic,” 
and then the camera cuts to 
a bloody, cult-like scene in 
which she screams, “We’re all 
witches!”

The first of Bee’s three main 

segments 
in 
the 
premiere 

focuses on the current electoral 
candidates 
and 
the 
general 

mood of the 2016 presidential 
campaign, 
notably 
Donald 

Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bernie 
Sanders, Ted Cruz and Marco 
Rubio. Bee roasts all of them 
equally, softening towards no 
one, but one can tell where her 
political affiliations lie. She 
refers to this electoral year as an 
“electoral shitshow,” explaining 

to the audience how ecstatic she 
is that she now gets to scream 
to people about how much she 
hates the candidates instead of 
just her TV screen. She refers 
to New Hampshire as the place 
that “democracy goes to die” 
and almost offhandedly calls 
Hillary Hermione Clinton. All 
of her jokes in this segment land 
squarely; they’re nuanced and 
accurate, holding developed, yet 
concise, analysis without being 
barbs.

Her cracks about abortion 

are particularly poignant. She 
zeroes in on Marco Rubio’s 
remarks 
on 
Clinton’s 
ideas 

about abortions, saying that 
Rubio meant Clinton would be 
willing to have people deliver 
their babies “into a Vitamix 
so Planned Parenthood can 
sell [them] to Whole Foods.” 
Something about her power 
stance — Bee doesn’t confine 
herself to sitting behind a desk 
— helps drive home her point 
even more.

Her second segment is titled 

the “Elected Paperweight of the 
Month,” which for this episode 
was Kansas state Senator Mitch 
Holmes. The main jokes of this 

segment revolve around the fact 
that Senator Holmes established 
a dress code specifically for 
women testifying in front of 
his committee — the men didn’t 
need one because they “knew” 
how to dress “appropriately.” 
She deconstructs his remarks 
so thoroughly that by the end, 
he ends up looking like a fool.

Her final main joke of the 

episode felt a little too long, but 
that made sense given that it’s a 
mock documentarian look into 
Jeb Bush’s campaign, which 
looks bleaker and weaker by the 
second.

Though her source material 

is 
overwhelmingly 
political, 

Samantha Bee’s timing as a 
feminist comedian could not 
have been better. During the 
past 
few 
years 
especially, 

feminist 
comedians 
have 

been carving out larger and 
wider spaces for themselves. 
Even performers who don’t 
market themselves explicitly 
as feminists have been getting 
more comfortable having social 
overtones in their art. Bee’s 
show fits seamlessly into the 
lineup of art and media with 
overt societal messages weaved 
into the humor and the back-
and-forth with the audience.

So Samantha Bee has picked 

a good time to burst into the 
scene. With the comic timing she 
developed as a correspondent on 
“The Daily Show,” a refreshing 
lack of self-deprecation in favor 
of pointed, focused humor and 
a good relationship with the 
camera, Bee is poised to carve 
out a sizable spot for herself on 
the nighttime circuit.

victory at Crisler
Wolverines upset Purdue as LeVert 
makes return from 11-game absence
Michigan becomes 

first team this 
season to beat 

Purdue on the glass

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team’s upset of No. 18 Purdue on 
Saturday wasn’t the first signature 
win the Wolverines have picked 
up this season, but it certainly 
looked much different than the 
others.

In Michigan’s wins against No. 

24 Texas and No. 2 Maryland, 
the Wolverines excelled largely 

because of their knack for hitting 
long-range bombs — 14 3-pointers 
against the Longhorns and 11 
against the Terrapins.

But thanks to pressure from 

elite 
guard 
Raphael 
Davis, 

the Boilermakers snuffed out 
Michigan’s 
3-point 
chances, 

leaving the team with just five 
successful triples. And things 
weren’t 
any 
easier 
for 
the 

Wolverines down low — in the 
teams’ first meeting this season 
back in January, the monstrous 
trio of 6-foot-9 Caleb Swanigan, 
7-foot A.J. Hammons and 7-foot-
2 Isaac Haas helped Purdue 
outrebound Michigan, 36-28, and 
outscore it in the paint, 42-18.

Instead of succumbing to the 

Walton’s heroics 
lift Michigan to 
big win in game’s 

final seconds

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

After Derrick Walton Jr. 

missed his third straight open 
look in the first half against 
Purdue, 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball coach John Beilein 
called him over to the bench.

“Make the shots, damn it,” 

Beilein told Walton.

The advice wasn’t a quick 

fix. The junior guard missed 
his first nine shots Saturday, 
but Beilein’s belief in sticking 
with Walton paid off on his 
10th attempt from the field, a 
drive to the hoop that pulled the 
Wolverines (9-4 Big Ten, 19-7 
overall) within one point of the 
18th-ranked Boilermakers (8-5, 
20-6) and eventually helped 
push them to a 61-56 win.

With just two minutes left 

in the first half and Michigan 
trailing by three, Walton put 
his head down and penetrated 
toward the rim, laying in a right-

handed lay-up against Purdue 
big man A.J. Hammons, who 
fouled him on the play.

“Honestly, I didn’t see it,” 

Walton said. “I kind of got 
clobbered, kind of reacted when 
the crowd reacted.”

The layup electrified Crisler 

Center and set Michigan up 
for a come-from-behind win. 
Walton missed the ensuing 
free throw, but a defensive stop 
on Purdue’s next possession 
led to a made jumper from 
junior guard Zak Irvin, giving 
Michigan its first lead since 
early in the first half.

The Wolverines put together 

two more stops, forcing the 
Boilermakers to foul. Walton 
went to the line twice in 
the game’s final 15 seconds, 
knocking down four straight 
free throws to clinch the win.

For 38 minutes, though, 

it looked like Walton and 
Michigan’s 
shooting 
woes 

would be the latest excuse 
in another home loss after 
lackluster 
performances 

spelled disaster against Indiana 
and Michigan State at home 
last week. Even with Walton’s 
early 0-for-9 from the field, 
Beilein didn’t want anyone else

A land without (much) Harbaugh talk

N

ORTH CAMPUS — Man, 
it seems like everyone 
is talking about Jim 

Harbaugh 
these days.

He was 

in the news 
Tuesday 
because the 
Southeastern 
Conference 
was upset 
with him, 
then again on 
Wednesday 
because he 
struck back and subtweeted — yes, 
subtweeted — the SEC. He made 
some more headlines later when 
ESPN radio host Paul Finebaum 
compared him to Donald Trump, 
and Harbaugh garnered even more 
face time by playing in a pro-am 
golf tournament this weekend in 
California.

But up until this point, the oft-

repeated refrain that everyone 
is always talking about Jim 
Harbaugh has gone largely 
untested. Sure, his sideline tirades 
dominated Facebook and Twitter 
news feeds during the season, and 
drunk kids at Michigan have a 
tendency to yell his catchphrase, 
“Who’s got it better than us?” But 
nobody has ever really figured 
out if the world actually revolves 
around Jim Harbaugh.

Friday, I decided to take 

matters into my own hands.

Since the Daily — no matter 

how often I asked — refused to 
send me to Mt. Everest to see if 
they were talking about Harbaugh 
there, I went to the second-
most isolated place on Earth: 
Michigan’s North Campus.

North Campus, for those of you 

unfamiliar with the area, is a full 
10-minute bus ride from Central 
Campus. For freshmen, living all 
the way up there is a social death 
sentence. They are forced to spend 
weekends upon weekends sleeping 
on dorm-room futons on Central 
Campus so they can go out with 

their friends at night without 
having to worry about making the 
last bus back to their dorms. I made 
a friend during the first week of 
freshman year who lived on North 
Campus ... I haven’t seen him since.

For older students, going up 

to North Campus is often an 
exercise in frustration. They must 
endure long waits in freezing 
temperatures for Michigan’s 
buses, which run on time about as 
often as a football team botches a 
punt to lose to its in-state rival.

A bunch of smart kids 

supposedly hang out on North 
Campus (trust me, I wouldn’t 
know), and a ton of engineering 
and computer science courses meet 
up there. Most of us Average Joes, 
however, never venture up to North 
Campus. Before Friday, I hadn’t 
stepped foot on North Campus soil 
since my freshman orientation in 
June 2012. But since it’s my last 
semester in Ann Arbor, I decided it 
was time to venture into unknown 
territory with enthusiasm very 
known to mankind.

I didn’t realize how big of 

a risk I was taking by going to 
North Campus until I had been 
on the bus for a few minutes 
and took a good look around. It 
was nearly full, and not a single 
person was wearing one of those 
Carhartt Players’ Tribune hats 

from Harbaugh’s Signing with 
the Stars event. I know, it seems 
preposterous, but apparently not 
a single one of the kids on the bus 
skipped class on a Wednesday 
morning to celebrate 17-year-olds 
making their college choices. That 
was a real wake-up call. You can’t 
even go 10 minutes without seeing 
one of those hats on Central 
Campus these days.

Even more alarming, I didn’t 

hear the word “Harbaugh” 
uttered once the entire bus 
ride. From what I could gather, 
it seemed like these kids were 
more concerned with things like 
“homework” and “midterms” 
than Jim Harbaugh. Weirdos.

My first stop on my North 

Campus journey was at the 
Bob and Betty Beyster Building 
(they really like alliteration up 
there). It’s apparently where all 
of the computer programmers 
study, and it’s probably the nicest 
building I’ve seen in Ann Arbor 
(apologies to the Stephen M. Ross 
School of Business).

I saw a couple of friends and 

sat for 20 minutes in a room full 
of kids doing coding homework. 
I honestly didn’t understand a 
single thing anyone said in that 
time period, but it sounded like 
they were all getting a C++ in 
their class. I was pretty surprised: 

In most of my classes, you can 
only get one plus. 

I didn’t hear any of the students 

in the room mention Harbaugh 
once. But if he ever needs a 
website designed, I’m sure they 
could help him out.

One of my friends told me 

my next stop should be at the 
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud 
Building because it has an 
airplane inside. I went to look at 
the airplane, and figured people 
would be talking about Harbaugh 
there, because he apparently uses 
his private jet a bunch.

But somehow, nobody was 

talking about Harbaugh there, 
either. A few kids were selling 
pizza for a club and others were 
hustling to class, but nobody 
appeared to be riled up about 
Harbaugh’s plan to take the 
football team to Florida during 
Spring Break. Even worse, I 
still haven’t figured out how 
to pronounce Francois-Xavier 
Bagnoud (if you have any idea, hit 
me up on LinkedIn).

After staring at the plane for a 

few minutes, I went to Pierpont 
Commons, which is apparently 
the Michigan Union of North 
Campus. The only downside is that 
it doesn’t have historic statues, a 
monumental JFK speech that took 
place on its steps or really much 

of anything worth noting. It does, 
however, have Panda Express.

When I arrived, most students 

were sitting around doing 
homework or socializing with 
their friends. I didn’t overhear 
any intense debates about 
Michigan football, so I wandered 
into the North Campus bookstore.

Inside, I found 20 racks and 

shelves devoted solely to Michigan 
engineering T-shirts. There 
was not a single rack or shelf for 
Michigan football apparel.

I did find, on a rack of 

miscellaneous shirts resembling 
a clearance rack, three “Welcome 
Home Coach” T-shirts. It 
appeared as though somebody, 
ever so slightly, was aware of 
Harbaugh’s existence on North 
Campus. NASA must’ve felt 
similarly when it discovered 
evidence of liquid water on Mars.

I figured I had to be missing 

something, though. I mean, the 
people of North Campus had to 
have some sort of opinion of Jim 
Harbaugh, so I began asking 
students what they thought about 
Michigan’s football coach.

Some of them, indeed, had 

heard of the guy.

“Love Jim Harbaugh,” said 

Mitch Jacobs, a junior majoring 
in nuclear engineering (I don’t 
know what nuclear engineering 

is, but I think it means he’s 
smarter than anyone reading this 
column). “Love his intensity. He 
might be a little shady in some 
recruiting things, but as far as I’m 
concerned, as long as winning 
happens, that’s what I like.”

Other students saw what I was 

seeing, and agreed there was less 
hype about Harbaugh on North 
Campus than on Central Campus. 
A couple of engineering students 
told me some of their fellow North 
Campus classmates just don’t get 
all that excited about Harbaugh 
or Michigan football.

One of those students, 

Jared Michelson, a sophomore 
mechanical engineering major, 
proved to be a clear exception.

“Jim Harbaugh is the messiah,” 

he said. “He is a gift from God.”

However, many of the other 

students I approached said they 
didn’t have time to talk about 
Harbaugh. Some said they had 
too much homework, while others 
said they had to rush to a meeting.

A few students even indicated 

they had more important things 
to do than talk about Harbaugh.

Maybe they could teach the 

SEC a lesson or two.

Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh may dominate national headlines, but on the University of Michigan’s North Campus, students have bigger things to worry about than a football coach.

‘M’ holds off Purdue

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team almost got a nasty 
taste of déjà vu Sunday.

On Jan. 

3, 
the 

Wolverines 
blew a six-
point lead in the final three 
minutes against Purdue to start 
their Big Ten schedule with a 
loss. One month later, Michigan 
almost found itself in the exact 
same position. 

After the Wolverines’ offense 

ran out of steam for nearly the 
entire fourth quarter Sunday, 
the Boilermakers brought the 
game to within four points in the 
final three minutes. Luckily for 
Michigan, its offense kicked back 
into gear to stay ahead down the 
stretch for a 68-61 win.

“Really happy for our team 

to come out with that win after 
the way we lost at our place,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “It was two similar-type 
games. … I thought they really 
made a run there in the fourth 
quarter. (Junior guard) Siera 
Thompson was able to make 
some big plays, and (senior 
guard) Madison Ristovski scored 
off an inbound, which really 
helped us, because we were in a 
period there where we couldn’t 
really score the basketball.”

With 
the 
Wolverines’ 

postseason momentum on the 
line game by game, they need 
every win they can get in the 
final stretch before the Big Ten 
Tournament in March. Now on 
a three-game winning streak, 
Michigan (7-7 Big Ten, 15-10 
overall) is starting to see its 
season bounce back after a few 
heart-wrenching losses early on.

Sunday’s game almost became 

another one.

Both 
teams 
committed 

17 turnovers, which led to 
inefficient offenses on both ends 
and several prolonged scoring 
droughts, one of which was 
nearly fatal for the Wolverines.

Thirty seconds into the final 

quarter, 
sophomore 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty hit a jumper 
to put Michigan up by 13. Then 

everything went south, as the 
Wolverines didn’t score a field 
goal for the following six and a 
half minutes.

During that time, freshman 

center Hallie Thome — who was 
used sparingly throughout the 
night due to foul trouble — made a 
pair of free throws, but fouled out 
at the five-minute mark.

Without Michigan’s big, things 

looked dismal. But then the 
Wolverines made their next three 
shots: a layup by Ristovski and 
back-to-back shots by Thompson, 
the latter being a 3-pointer.

“For us to come in here and be 

able to pull out a victory against 
a tough, physical, defensive team 
like Purdue when Hallie fouled 
out of the game and really wasn’t 
able to play a lot of minutes,” 
Barnes Arico said, “(it’s) a solid 
win for us for sure.”

Michigan’s 
balanced 
attack 

proved to be the difference maker 
late in the game, as four players 
reached 
double-digit 
scoring 

— Flaherty (17), Thome (14), 
Thompson (13) and Ristovski (11).

“We need additional scorers 

to Katelynn and Hallie,” Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“Usually 
when 

Katelynn has her most high-
scoring nights, we lose the game. 
We need a balanced attack.”

While Thompson found success 

driving into the paint, sophomore 
forward Jillian Dunston and 
senior forward Kelsey Mitchell 
controlled the glass, even though 
Purdue outrebounded Michigan, 
38-37. With Thome out of the 
picture, the Wolverines fell back 
on its next-best duo.

With the much needed win 

in West Lafayette, Michigan 
moves to .500 in conference 
play for the first time since early 
January. More importantly, the 
Wolverines move farther away 
from becoming one of the bottom 
four teams in the conference — all 
of which will have to win a play-
in game to compete in the Big Ten 
Tournament.

But for Michigan to be sure 

of missing a play-in game, it will 
need to avoid more heart-racing 
games like Sunday’s.

SOFTBALL
Michigan wins four of five

By BETELHEM ASHAME

Daily Sports Writer

In its first glimpse of game 

action since losing to Florida 
in the Women’s College World 
Series in June, the No. 2 Michigan 
softball team picked up right 
where it left off.

Putting together a string of 

dominant 
performances, 
the 

Wolverines capitalized on their 
prowess at the plate and on 
the mound to win four out of 
five games at the USF Wilson-
Demarini Tournament over the 
weekend in Tampa, Fla. Their lone 
loss came against No. 1 Florida.

The opening day was smooth 

sailing for Michigan (4-1), as it 
downed both South Carolina 
and 
Illinois 
State 
in 
five 

innings each. With scores of 
15-3 and 12-0, respectively, the 
Wolverines got off to a roaring 
start, making a strong statement 
with a pair of run-rule victories 
to kick off the season.

“We have a really strong lineup, 

it’s really deep,” said junior 
shortstop Abby Ramirez. “We 
have a lot of players who aren’t in 
the lineup who can contribute as 
well. But if we just stay focused 
and keep the one-pitch mentality 
and not make the game bigger 
than it is, we should be fine. I’m 
really excited to see what we do 
this year.”

Two 
of 
Michigan’s 
All-

Americans 
— 
senior 
second 

baseman 
Sierra 
Romero 
and 

junior left fielder Kelly Christner 
— started the team off on the right 
foot. Romero went 3-for-3 against 
the Gamecocks, including a grand 
slam to match a career-best six 
RBI. 
Christner 
followed 
suit 

against the Redbirds, batting 3-for-
4 with three RBI. In both games, 
the Wolverines scored in each of 
their four innings at the plate and 
nine different players contributed 
with hits in the twin bill.

In the circle, junior right-

hander Megan Betsa and fifth-
year senior right-hander Sara 
Driesenga 
shut 
down 
their 

opponents. Betsa allowed only one 
run against the Gamecocks while 
striking out seven to earn the win. 
Meanwhile, 
Driesenga 
struck 

out three and partnered up with 
sophomore right hander Tera 
Blanco to shut out the Redbirds. 
Blanco made some extra noise by 
striking out six of seven batters 
in her first stint as a full-fledged 
member of the pitching staff.

“Strikeouts just come naturally 

to me because I have a lot of spin 
on my ball and never really rely 
on velocity. They’ve always been 
part of my game,” Betsa said. 
“But we’re all different pitchers. 
Sara pitches for contact and 
Tera pitches for both velocity 
and contact, so it’s just having 
different tools in our arsenal.”

Blanco got the start for the 

first game of day two, a highly 
anticipated 
rematch 
against 

Florida. Despite her strong outing 
the day before and her 2-for-2 
performance at the plate, Blanco 
was roughed up by the Gators, who 
scored seven runs — five earned 
— 
on 
seven 

hits in under 
three 
innings 

of 
work. 
At 

the same time, 
Florida pitcher 
Kelly Barnhill 
neutralized 
Michigan’s 
potent offense, 
allowing 
just 

three hits in 
a 
five-inning 

shutout en route to the Gators’ 8-0 
run-rule victory.

“We’re not where we need to 

be, because we didn’t compete 
in that game in any aspect,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“I was disappointed with our 
process the entire game because 
we made it about Florida. If we 
use it for what it needs to be, 
which is it’s not acceptable, it can 
propel us. We don’t need to beat 
ourselves up; if you don’t play 
well, anyone can throttle you. Our 
pitching didn’t set the tone, our 
offense didn’t help us out and our 
defense opened up the door a lot, 
so none of our game was there.

“The good news is we didn’t 

play well. It’d be one thing if they 
beat us 8-0 and we had played our 
best, then I’d be concerned, but we 
just need to show up to play the 
game. The game never changes, 

and the game never knows who’s 
playing. And we can get a lot 
better at that and we will.”

Needing 
to 
bounce 
back 

against South Florida later that 
day, the Wolverines relied on 
Betsa to lead the charge. Betsa 
stepped up in the circle and 
delivered, striking out eight in 
a complete-game effort to seal 
Michigan’s 11-2 win.

At the plate, the Wolverines’ 

offense woke up from its slumber 
in a hurry, scoring five first-inning 
runs to make their play against 
Florida look like an anomaly. 
Homers flew once again, as senior 
right fielder Kelsey Susalla and 
freshman catcher Alex Sobczak 
joined the party with bombs that 
cleared the fence with ease.

The 
Wolverines 
took 
on 

Virginia 
Tech 
early 
Sunday 

morning in their final game of 
the weekend. Driesenga held 

down the fort, 
allowing 
just 

three hits and 
one earned run 
in five innings 
in the circle. 
And the duo 
of 
Romero 

and Christner 
struck 
again. 

In the third, 
Romero 
took 

matters 
into 

her own hands with a solo homer 
to tie the game at 1-1. Two innings 
later, Christner provided the 
game-winning 
RBI 
single 
in 

Michigan’s 3-1 victory.

Even after an opening weekend 

that saw them outscore opponents 
41-14, the Wolverines know there 
is room to grow. Their strong 
wins and their disappointing loss 
provided key learning experiences, 
and Michigan intends to use both 
as the season moves on.

“We have a lot of potential, 

but we have a lot of work to do,” 
Betsa said. “We need to go into 
each game with confidence and 
know that we are good enough 
to beat anyone.”

The Wolverines may be good 

enough to beat any team, but 
only one foe matters most. For 
Michigan, Florida remains the 
one that got away.

“If you don’t 

play well, 
anyone can 
throttle you.”

‘M’ finishes regular season strong

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

Senior Night can often be 

a source of distraction and 
emotions, but the No. 9 Michigan 
wrestling 
team 
was 

able to look 
past 
the 

festivities and finish the regular 
season 
strong 
Friday 
night, 

beating No. 23 Purdue, 30-11. 

The Wolverines (8-1 Big Ten, 

13-2 overall) followed the same 
script they have been using for 
most of the season: Keep it close, 
and the big guys will close out 
the match. 

“The duals are usually real 

close, and then we crush people 
in the last three fights,” said 
sixth-year senior Max Huntley. 

Though the bottom three 

weight 
classes 
secured 
the 

victory and the match, they could 
not do it without the help of some 
of the lighter-weight wrestlers. 
After earning major decisions 
from both redshirt junior Conor 
Youtsey and senior Rossi Bruno, 
the Wolverines jumped out to an 
early 8-0 lead, and they looked 
like they were going to coast to 
victory and head into postseason 
play with momentum. 

However, the Boilermakers did 

not go down easily. Purdue (4-4, 
8-6) was able to take advantage 
of lineup changes by Michigan, 
which suffered a setback at the 
141-pound weight class that has 
struggled most of the year.

“We are still trying to figure 

out 141,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “We are giving 
both guys opportunities to go 
out and compete, and we just 
gotta evaluate them.” 

After the win, Purdue was 

on the board and hoped to 
continue its momentum, but 
Michigan 
sophomore 
Alec 

Pantaleo regained control and 
earned another major decision 
for the Wolverines. It was not 
an easy victory for Pantaleo, but 
he broke open the match in the 

third period by outscoring his 
opponent, 8-1. 

“I think that kid watched a 

little tape,” Pantaleo said. “ (He) 
probably knew what I was gonna 
do, so that shut me down a little 
bit. (Then) a 
thing 
kinda 

twitched 
in 

my head, ‘I can 
score on this 
kid whenever,’ 
so I started 
moving a little 
bit, and I got in 
more angles.” 

The 

Boilermakers 
continued to fight back, and with 
just four duals remaining, they 
found themselves trailing by only 
one point. The next dual played 
a pivotal role in the match, and 
Michigan 
looked 
to 
redshirt 

sophomore Aaron Calderon to 

shut down the chance of a Purdue 
victory. 

This season has been anything 

but normal for Calderon. He 
recently accepted the challenge 
of stepping in for injured redshirt 

freshman 
Davonte 
Mahomes. 
Calderon 
fought 
tough 

and secured a 
victory for the 
Wolverines, 
giving them a 
15-11 lead, with 
Michigan’s 
“Murderer’s 

Row” still left to wrestle. 

“It’s been a great experience, 

really kind of changing my view 
on the team,” Calderon said. “I 
get to be a part of it more and 
go on the trips and build some 
camaraderie with the varsity 

team members that I haven’t 
really gotten too much of a 
chance to get to know.”

With Michigan’s top-three 

wrestlers coming to the mat, 
the match was all but secured 
with the Wolverines up by four. 
The bottom three combined for 
15 points in their matches, with 
Huntley ending his regular-
season career on a high note, 
earning a technical fall and 
giving Michigan a 19-11 lead 
to 
make 
a 
Purdue 
victory 

impossible.

As he has done his whole 

wrestling career as a Wolverine, 
Huntley was lighthearted and 
cracked jokes after the match. 
After all, not only had he 
experienced some Senior Night 
camaraderie, but Michigan had 
just earned the momentum it 
needed to propel itself into the 
postseason.

Wolverines beat 
Michigan State

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

Daily Sports Writer

No matter the competition, the 

rivalry between Michigan and 
Michigan State will always be 
present.

Behind junior Talia Chiarelli 

and freshman Olivia Karas, the No. 
3 Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team was able to win this round 
of competition, 197.225-195.425, 
against the Spartans on Sunday at 
Crisler Center.

Anchored 
by 
a 
stellar 

performance from Chiarelli, who 
scored a career-high 9.925 in the 
vault, the Wolverines started 
strong and never looked back.

Though the rivalry between 

Michigan and the Spartans can 
sometimes 
be 
aggressive, 
in 

gymnastics, the players see it 
differently.

“It’s always fun to compete 

against them,” said junior Nicole 
Artz. “I’d say it’s more of a 
friendly rivalry with gymnastics. 
 

We get along with them, but it is 
also always nice to beat Michigan 
State in Crisler.”

Artz had a successful day 

herself, tying season highs in the 
vault and uneven bars with scores 
of 9.800 and 9.925, respectively.

The Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten, 

8-1 overall) beat the Spartans 
(1-4, 3-5), despite having less 
preparation time than usual 
because of their meet on Monday.

“We’ve never had a Monday 

night meet before, and we don’t 
typically have Sunday meets,” 
said Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 
“We’ve had to be a little bit creative. 
Last week, we took Tuesday off 
and trained Wednesday, Thursday 
and Friday.”

Michigan won the meet even 

though 
it 
competed 
without 

senior Briley Casanova for the 
fourth straight time.

“(Casanova) has a back issue 

going on right now, that we just 
need to get resolved,” Plocki said. 
“(There’s) nothing we can really 
do except for wait. Hopefully it 
will resolve and heal itself and 
she’ll be feeling better.”

Plocki did not give a specific 

time table for Casanova’s return, 
but did not deem it a season-
ending injury.

Even though Casanova could 

not participate, others such as 
senior Lindsay Williams continued 
to perform at high standards. 
Williams notched her career best 
in the beam with a 9.900.

After 
a 
disappointing 

performance in the beam two 
weeks ago against Nebraska, the 
Wolverines’ work in practice has 
shown, maintaining their new 
streak of “49s.”

Before that meet in Lincoln, 

Michigan had five straight meets 
in which it scored at least a 49 
in every event. A disappointing 
showing against the Cornhuskers 
contributed to the streak’s ending, 
but a new one now continues.

Other 
bright 
spots 
for 

Michigan included Karas, who 
after a slight trip at the end of 
her vault routine, attained the 
top floor score in addition to solid 
performances in bars and beam.

Plocki reiterated the friendly 

rivalry concept articulated by 
Artz. Many of the Wolverines 
have preexisting relationships 
with athletes on the Spartans. 
Plocki also spoke of her positive 
relationship with Michigan State 
coach Kathie Klages.

“A lot of times when we go 

to college meets (the athletes) 
have old teammates on other 
teams,” Plocki said. “During the 
competition, it’s very competitive, 
but after they’re going over and 
hugging their old friends.”

And for the Wolverines, they 

had more to hug about than just 
seeing their old friends. 

WOMEN’S GYMNASTICS

Florida tops Wolverines 

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

Six minutes — that’s all that 

stood between the Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team and a 
program-
defining 
upset 
win 

against No. 
7 Florida on Saturday.

But during those six minutes, 

the Wolverines watched their 
lead, and potential first-ever 
win against a ranked opponent, 
slip away.

Florida’s 
comeback 
started 

when attacker Shayna Pirreca 
scored an unassisted goal to 
narrow Michigan’s lead. Just 
45 seconds later, Pirreca scored 
another goal to shrink the Gators’ 
deficit to one goal; 30 seconds 
later, Pirreca scored her third 
straight unassisted goal to tie the 
game at 11. The Wolverines’ lead 
had vanished.

“You slow down for five 

minutes, and they’re going to 
catch up,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Ulehla. “That’s an Xs 
and Os thing, and that’s on me as a 
coach to make sure we’re focusing 
on those things in practice.”

With four and a half minutes 

remaining, and all the momentum 
on 
the 
Gator 
sideline, 
the 

Wolverines were forced to be 
on the defensive for the rest of 
the game. Florida was able to 
consistently hold the ball, taking a 
few shots in the process. As each 
second passed, Michigan’s once-
solid lead was a fleeting memory. 
With 10 seconds remaining, and 
overtime seeming like a possible 
refuge from the disaster of the 
final six minutes, attacker Sammi 
Burgess fired a lethal shot into the 
back of the net, giving Florida a 
12-11 lead.

Michigan managed to win 

the final faceoff, and, with time 
expiring, junior attacker Jess 
Angerman fired a shot at the 
net. But the shot went wide. 
Time expired, and with it went 
the Wolverines’ hopes for the 
program’s biggest win ever.

Despite the heartbreak, the 

loss was a promising result for a 
program that is only in its third 
year competing in Division I. In 

the past two years combined, 
Michigan lost to the Gators by a 
combined score of 41-4.

“The program has come so 

far since the last time we played 
Florida,” Ulehla said. “Are we 
disappointed about the loss? 
Most definitely. But for us, this 
program took big strides today. 
Nationally, as far as gaining 
respect, we’re a program to be 
reckoned with. We’re definitely 
looking forward to this season 
and getting better and better as 
each game goes by.”

Michigan (1-1) opened up its 

second game of the season strong, 
with two early back-to-back goals 
by junior midfielders Madeline 
Dion and Anna Schueler to seize a 
2-0 lead in Gainesville, Fla.

The Gators tallied three goals 

in three minutes to reclaim a 3-2 
lead. The Wolverines responded 
just as strongly, though, scoring 
two goals to take the lead back at 
4-3. Florida had the upper-hand 
for the rest of the half, scoring 
four unanswered goals to take 
a 7-4 lead, before a late goal by 
Angerman narrowed the Gators’ 
lead to 7-5 at halftime.

“I think just the fact that we 

really competed (stood out), every 
single one of us,” Ulehla said. 
“Normally, when you look at the 
stats, it’s very clear as to who our 
big guns are, and today that’s not 

the case. This, overall, was just a 
great team performance.”

After a quick goal 10 seconds 

into the second half, the Gators 
held an even bigger 8-5 lead. Yet 
the goal also managed to have 
another effect: waking up the 
Wolverines’ offense.

Junior 
midfielder 
Kim 

Coughlan started the comeback 
for Michigan, scoring her first 
goal of the game to narrow the 
deficit to 8-6. Within the next 
minute, junior attackers Lauren 
Oberlander and Tess Korten both 
scored to tie the game at eight.

But the Wolverines weren’t 

finished yet. After eight minutes 
of scoreless play, junior attacker 
Allie Breitfeller found twine to 
give Michigan its first lead since 
the 14-minute mark of first half.

Following four more minutes 

of scoreless play, the Wolverines 
further added to their lead. 
Oberlander and Coughlan each 
scored an unassisted goal to take 
an 11-8 lead. On the verge of a 
historic upset, all Michigan had 
to do was survive the final 10 
minutes.

Four minutes ticked off the 

clock. The Wolverines were still 
holding strong with a three-
goal lead.

But from there, it went all 

downhill. Six minutes proved to 
be too much.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Junior midfielder Kim Coughlin scored twice in Michigan’s 12-11 loss to Florida.

Throwers power Michigan

Wolverines set 
21 total personal 
records between 
split-squad meets

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

Just 
seven 
short 
months 

ago, Grant Cartwright started 
training on the weight and 
hammer throw for the first time 
since a lower-back injury in 
high school. But even after a few 
years, the redshirt sophomore 
threw 19.71 meters to place 
fourth overall Friday. 

“Throwing 
this 
mark 
is 

definitely a big milestone for 
me in my athletic career,” 
Cartwright said. “I let myself 
be happy with what I did today, 
but the goal is to keep throwing 
as far as I can and score as 
many points for the team. It’s 
obviously satisfying to throw 
benchmarks, but I don’t get 
satisfied very easily.”

Cartwright and the Michigan 

men’s track and field team 
participated in its fourth and 
final split-squad weekend of the 
indoor season. The Wolverine 
field event athletes traveled to 
Geneva, Ohio, to compete in the 
SPIRE Collegiate Invitational 
for a two-day event, and the 
runners went to Ames, Iowa, 
for the Iowa State Classic. In 
the 
second-to-last 
weekend 

before the Big Ten Indoor 
Championships begin, Michigan 
set a total of 21 personal records.

Adding 
to 
an 
already 

impressive weekend, Cartwright 
participated in the shot-put 
event and threw 19.94 meters, 
the third-best throw in program 
history, on the second day of 
competition. 

“I wanted to do it for my 

team,” Cartwright said. “They’re 
working hard for me, so I should 
work hard for them. Everybody 
really cares about other people’s 
accomplishments. We’re moving 
in a right direction as a program. 
The culture is changing rapidly 
into a highly competitive and 

positive area, where we just try 
to go out there and be the best 
we can. It’s very exciting to be a 
part of it.”

Though Cartwright sustained 

a pointer-finger injury back in 
December, he didn’t let it stop 
him from trying to rehabilitate 
as quickly as possible — a pattern 
in his track and field career. 

“I think I came as far as I have 

because coach Jerry Clayton 
is such a fantastic coach,” 
Cartwright said. “I listen to the 
best of my ability to everything 
he’s told me to do.” 

Added Clayton: “The thing 

with 
(Cartwright), 
he’s 
one 

of the athletes that has really 
focused in, and does everything 
he can, to be the best he can. 
He’s made that commitment. He 
does everything he’s asked, both 
on and off. That’s the type of 
individual we need leading our 
team.”

Cartwright puts emphasis on 

his relationship with his fellow 
thrower and training partner, 
redshirt freshman Joe Ellis, 
for helping him with his focus. 
Ellis, himself, made headlines 
when he threw 20.08 meters 
in the weight throw to finish 
fourth — over Cartwright’s fifth 
— overall. The distance also 
qualified as the third best in 
program history. 

“The two of them are working 

together and focused, and that’s 
the key,” Clayton said. “That’s 
what I’m used to in the most 
successful 
programs 
I’ve 
been 
a 

part of. That’s 
the 
type 
of 

atmosphere, 
leadership 
and 
individuals 
I’m 
used 

to 
working 

with. 
These 

two throwers 
are young and the future of the 
program. 

“They really feed off of each 

other with staying focused. 
It’s not just in athletics, but in 
academics, they make those 
sacrifices, too.” 

Clayton is in his third season 

at the helm of the program 
and 
works 
primarily 
with 

the throwers and jumpers. In 
total, Clayton has coached 16 
individual NCAA Champions. 

Elsewhere in Ohio, redshirt 

junior Steven Bastien set a 
personal record in the pole 
vault, 
clearing 
4.73 
meters. 

Bastien finished fifth overall, 
right behind redshirt freshman 
Kevin 
Haughn. 
Freshman 

Nick Burkhalter also cleared a 
personal record at 4.58 meters. 

During 
the 
second 
day 

of 
competition, 
redshirt 

sophomore 
triple-jumper 

Kevin Stephens Jr. took third 
place after flying 14.89 meters. 
Stephens finished third and also 
claimed the ninth-best distance 
in program history. 

In Iowa, the runners also 

made fast strides en route to the 
Big Ten Indoor Championships. 
In the mile run, all three 
Wolverines set personal bests, 
led by redshirt freshman Chase 
Barnett (4:03.77) in 13th overall. 

In 
sprints, 
senior 
Phil 

Washington III ran 47.99 in the 
400 meter to finish ninth overall 
and second in his section. 
Freshman Blake Washington 
(49.09) ran a personal best in the 
same event. 

Next week’s meet, the Alex 

Wilson Invitational on Saturday, 
Feb. 20, will wrap up the regular 
season, with the Big Ten Indoor 
Championship just two weeks 

away. 

“This is a 

time for people 
to change their 
workload,” 
Clayton 
said. 

“The 
critical 

phase is: are 
they going to 
make 
those 

adjustments? 
We, as coaches, 
don’t 
get 
on 

the track, the athletes have to 
have that confidence. That’s the 
thing I was pleased about this 
weekend. The athletes really did 
compete. We have a lot of work 
ahead of us, but we’re excited 
about the focus going forward.”

quarterbacking his defense.

“There was a point in the 

game where some people on my 
bench were saying, ‘Get him out 
of there,’ ” Beilein said. “But the 
dude scored 26 points the other 
night. I’m not taking him out.”

On a day in which Michigan 

couldn’t 
find 
its 
shooting 

rhythm — it finished the game 
5-for-20 from 3-point range and 
shot at a 36-percent clip overall 
from the field — it took grit from 
Walton and his teammates to 
steal the game against a bigger 
Purdue team.

“Shooting numbers right now 

are just going out the window at 
this point,” Walton said. “When 
guys look back at the stat sheet, 
we don’t really care at this 
point. We just want to make 
sure that we did exactly what 
we needed to and then a little 
more than needed.”

Zak Irvin did more than 

needed in the second half. After 
getting bullied early by Purdue 
forward Caleb Swanigan and 
going just 2-for-7 from the 
field in the first frame, Irvin 
flipped the script. Irvin went 
off for four 3s in the second 
half, including two on back-
to-back possessions to answer 
two straight treys from Purdue. 
Irvin finished with a game-
high 22 points and was the 
only Wolverine to reach double 
digits in scoring.

In the first half, it looked 

like Purdue’s big men would 
overpower Michigan’s, just as 
they had five weeks earlier in 
West Lafayette. Swanigan got 
easy looks in the paint, as did 
Hammons and 7-foot-2 center 
Isaac Haas. But in the second 
half, Michigan outrebounded 
Purdue 23-18 and outscored the 
Boilermakers in the paint.

“I’m just proud of how hard 

we fought,” Irvin said. “I don’t 
think anyone would’ve expected 
us to outrebound them, get more 
points in the paint. Our goal is 
always to hold them to under 
40 percent (from the field), and 
they shot 39 percent, which is 
huge, and you really win this 
game on defense.”

Swanigan outmatched Irvin 

early, bodying his way into 
the paint and putting in easy 

buckets. Forward Isaac Haas 
did the same against Michigan 
forwards 
Mark 
Donnal 
and 

Moritz Wagner, using his 7-foot-
2 frame to bully them down low, 
but the Wolverines were able to 
hang in and take just a four-point 
deficit into the locker room at 
half time, setting up a second-
half comeback.

Beilein called it a “gritty not 

pretty” performance and said 
that it’s proof that this team can 
win in more than one way.

The win gives Michigan its 

second victory over a ranked 
opponent, the other coming last 
month against No. 3 Maryland, 
and helps boost the Wolverines 
resume come NCAA Tournament 
time. The win also marked the 
return of senior guard Caris 
LeVert. LeVert missed the prior 
11 games due to a lower left leg 
injury and was a game-time 
decision.

He came off the bench seven 

minutes into the first half and 
tallied 11 minutes in the frame 
but did not score. He did not play 
in the second half.

Beilein said LeVert is still 

getting back into basketball 
shape and will continue to 
evaluate his playing time.

size disadvantage, though, the 
Wolverines played one of their 
more inspired, physical games 
of the season and wound up 
beating the Boilermakers in 
both categories — 39-35 in the 
rebounding battle, 24 points to 
22 in the paint.

It was the first time Purdue has 

been outrebounded all season, 
and seven different Michigan 
players grabbed three or more 
boards. With the performance, 
the 
Wolverines 
effectively 

proved they have what it takes to 
pull off what they called a “gritty, 
not pretty” win without shooting 
particularly well.

They also managed to hold 

Purdue scoreless for the final 
three minutes of the game, sealing 
the victory with an 11-0 run.

“There are different ways to 

win,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “We have to take what 
the defense gives us. That was 
surprising, because you can’t 
get to the rim as well as you’d 
like to (against Purdue). ... It is 
good for our guys to realize that 
we’re more than just (a 3-point 

shooting team).”

Despite giving up 35 pounds 

in his defensive matchup with 
Swanigan, 
junior 
forward 

Zak Irvin was crucial to the 
Wolverines’ 
effort. 
Swanigan 

still finished the game with 14 
points, but Irvin made a point of 
making the talented freshman 
work hard on the defensive end 
as well.

“(Swanigan’s) a great player, 

a great freshman,” Irvin said. 
“We were battling down low, but 
then also, he has to guard me on 
the perimeter on the other end. 
That’s just the mindset I had in 
the second half.”

It worked perfectly — Irvin 

scored a team-high 22 points, 
including a huge mid-range 
floater that gave the Wolverines a 
57-56 lead with 1:09 remaining in 
the game.

“Zak was the key guy,” Beilein 

said. “There’s always a matchup 
with another team that maybe 
we can exploit, and we tried to 
use whoever was guarding Zak.”

Irvin was really the only 

Wolverine who had any kind of 
shooting success, finishing as 
the only double-digit scorer and 
hitting four of Michigan’s five 
3-pointers.

His explosion was key on a 

day when the Wolverines’ best 
scorers couldn’t knock down 
shots. Junior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. only made one basket 
Saturday, and senior guard Caris 
LeVert — who played in his first 
game since sustaining a lower-
left-leg injury Dec. 30 — missed 
the only shot he took in his 11 
minutes on the floor.

But though those two guards 

weren’t able to contribute to the 
scoring, they boosted Michigan’s 
defensive effort by combining 
for 12 rebounds despite the 
Boilermakers’ daunting size. And 
in the end, that effort was enough 
to pull off the upset on a day when 
the Wolverines honored the 
late Chad Carr and his family’s 
ChadTough foundation.

“If you look at this (box score), 

we outrebounded Purdue — that 
may be the only time you ever see 
that stat,” Beilein said. “We got 
it done somehow — Chad Carr, I 
think, was batting the ball around 
to us as a little angel somewhere, 
and we were getting the ball. We 
ended being able to get enough 
done so they didn’t get too many 
second opportunities.”

Wolverines put 
on the greatest 

show on ice

M

ADISON — Michigan 
is far from perfect 
this season, but there 

may be no 
squad in all 
of college 
hockey that 
is more fun 
to watch.

The 

Wolverines 
are leading 
the nation 
in scoring 
offense 
(4.78 goals 
per game) for the second 
consecutive season, and are 
playing a blend of attacking 
hockey made for primetime.

Take this weekend for 

example, when Michigan fell 
just short of a clean sweep 
against Wisconsin. In two 
contests, the Wolverines tallied 
eight goals, gave away five leads 
and saw three players settle 
into the top four in the NCAA 
for points per game.

There was a shootout, a 

flurry of late-period goals 
and even some official review 
drama. Michigan won Friday’s 
matchup, 4-1, and salvaged 
Saturday’s contest with a 5-4 
shootout win.

Through all of it, the sixth-

ranked Wolverines played a 
wide-open game — beating 
defenders to the net with a 
combination of speed and 
creativity. It’s a contrasting 
style to hard-nosed “East Coast 
Hockey” that has defined the 
NCAA for years, but that’s part 
of the fun.

By playing to its strengths, 

Michigan has eschewed the 
conventional blueprint for 
NCAA title contention in favor 
of run-and-gun abandon. It’s 
tempting to debate whether this 
strategy can pay championship 
dividends, but the better 
reaction might be just to sit 
back and watch history unfold.

* * *

There has perhaps never 

been an offense as prolific 
as Michigan’s in the modern 
history of college hockey.

No team since the 1999-2000 

season has surpassed the scoring 
offense mark the Wolverines 
have set so far this season. The 
closest was Minnesota with 4.48 
goals per game in 2001-2002.

On an individual level, the 

case is perhaps even stronger.

Freshman forward and 

budding superstar Kyle Connor 
leads the nation in points per 
game (1.78) by a staggering 12 
percent. In 
second place 
is his center, 
junior JT 
Compher, 
who leads 
the nation 
in assists. In 
fourth place 
is junior Tyler 
Motte, the 
right winger 
on that line. 
Motte’s tally of 27 goals not 
only leads the country, but is 
also already the highest NCAA 
regular-season total in years.

And that’s just the first line.
The Wolverines have a deep 

roster of speed and finesse. 
Senior Boo Nieves centers the 
second line and became the 
first Michigan player to join the 
100-point club since 2012 on 
Saturday night.

Senior Justin Selman and 

junior Alex Kile have made 
their mark on the score sheet 
as well, combining for a total of 
44 points. And that’s without 
mentioning freshman Cooper 
Marody, who led the team in 
scoring early this season before 
being sidelined by sickness.

The level of success on the 

offensive end, even against 
inferior Big Ten defenses, is 
simply astounding. There’s little 
precedent for how to play such 
an aggressive brand of hockey, 
especially when it comes to 
tournament time, but there 
doesn’t appear to be one for 

defending it either.

* * *

Michigan’s success this 

season has largely resonated 
from an ability to adapt. 
Opponents’ attempts to stifle 
the scoring onslaught have been 
stymied by the the Wolverines’ 
depth and perseverance.

Early in the season, 

rocky goaltending and an 
inexperienced defense 
hampered the team’s offensive 
momentum. Conceding easy 
goals would disrupt the flow 
of the game and leave players 
clearly frustrated. That 
frustration would snuff the 
Wolverines’ offense out like a 
light.

Fast forward to this 

weekend, when a defensive 
gamble resulted in a game-
tying goal for the Badgers with 
26.1 seconds remaining in 
regulation.

This time, frustration wasn’t 

the right word — players were 
pissed off. Compher slammed 
his stick into the endboards 
following the horn, and tempers 
continued to flare long after the 
team left the ice.

But in the overtime period, 

there was no sign of slowing 
down. Michigan’s offense 
continued to push the pace, 
trust the defense and play the 
brand of hockey it knows best.

Senior goaltender Steve 

Racine took the spotlight with a 
string of show-stopping saves — 
including denying a breakaway 
by Wisconsin star forward Luke 
Kunin in the final minute. That 
kind of poise was completely 
absent from Michigan’s net just 
a few months ago, but today this 
is a more complete team.

* * *

The unprecedented offensive 

production shouldn’t come as a 
complete surprise.

Michigan coach Red 

Berenson has been one of the 
game’s great proponents of 
offense, dating all the way back 
to his playing days. His storied 
time behind the Wolverines’ 
bench has long since become 
the focal point of his career, 
but he is also one of just two 
players to score six goals — a 
double hat-trick — in a National 
Hockey League game since the 
end of World War II.

In the week leading up to 

the Wisconsin series, Berenson 
commented that offense wasn’t 
the only key to winning a game, 
but that it was certainly part of 

the answer.

Since 

missing the 
tournament 
for the first 
time in over 
two decades 
in 2013, 
it’s been 
Berenson’s 
formidable 
task to rebuild 
the program 

amid a changing landscape in 
college hockey.

Well, the product finally 

materialized in this year’s team, 
and it’s wildly enjoyable.

College hockey has always 

been about scoring goals, but 
this feels different. Michigan 
threatens to score on every shift 
and its passing around the net 
borders on telepathic.

Maybe the Wolverines’ 

success will usher in a new 
era of offense in the NCAA, 
or maybe it will never be 
replicated again. But those 
aren’t questions that need 
answering right now.

March will likely bring 

Michigan back to the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
since 2012. It’s anyone’s guess 
how this high-octane offense 
will fare in that setting, but 
one thing’s for sure — it will be 
entertaining as hell.

‘M’ settles for shootout win

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

MADISON — With a minute 

to play in overtime, Wisconsin’s 
Luke Kunin barreled down the 
ice toward 
senior 
Michigan 
netminder 
Steve Racine. Racine played the 
breakaway calmly, slamming 
his pads shut and scrambling to 
cover the loose rebound.

It was the save of the game in a 

dramatic 5-4 shootout win for the 
sixth-ranked Wolverines (9-2-3-2 
Big Ten, 18-4-5 overall).

JT 
Compher 
embodied 

Michigan’s frustration at the 
inability to put the game away in 
regulation when he slammed his 
stick against the endboards after 
the horn marked the end of the 
third period. But in a weekend 
full of momentum shifts, odd 
bounces and wacky calls, the 
Wolverines took the result and 
ran for the team buses.

“We were lucky to come out 

of here with two points,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“If it weren’t for our goalie, we 
wouldn’t have gotten anything.”

Added Racine: “Luckily we got 

the extra point, but it still kind of 
felt like a loss.”

The storyline of the first 

period was special teams. After 
taking just two penalties in 
Friday’s 
contest, 
a 
Michigan 

player headed to the box twice in 
the first 20 minutes. Wisconsin 
came out flying in its first power 
play opportunity, moving the 
puck across the offensive zone 
with ease and flustering the 
Wolverines’ penalty killers.

But on the second power play, 

everything fell apart for the 
Badgers. Michigan junior forward 
JT Compher broke up a Wisconsin 
pass in the defensive zone and 
streaked up the ice with fellow 
junior forward Tyler Motte in 
tow. Compher then floated a pass 
to the NCAA’s leading goal scorer, 
and Motte roofed a backhand into 

the upper netting.

The goal was Motte’s 27th of 

the year, his 11th straight contest 
with a goal and his second game-
opening tally of the weekend. All 
series against the Badgers, he made 
the extraordinary look routine.

But Wisconsin wasn’t out of 

fight yet. The Badgers tied the 
game at one apiece for the second 
night in a row on a well-placed 
pass from the point. Freshman 
forward Luke Kunin carved out 
space for himself in the slot and 
redirected the puck just past 
Wolverines’ 
senior 
goaltender 

Steve Racine.

Freshman forward Kyle Connor 

answered with another Michigan 
goal halfway through the period. 
The breakout star (Connor leads 
the NCAA in points per game with 
1.77) fielded a perfect pass from 
junior defenseman Nolan De Jong 
and walked into the offensive 
zone with just the goalie to beat. 
A Wisconsin defender drew a 
penalty with a desperate slash, 
but Connor fought off the contact, 
besting the Badger’s netminder 
with an emphatic one-two move.

It appeared that Michigan 

might fend off Wisconsin in a 

similar fashion to the previous 
night, but Grant Besse changed the 
course of the game. With under 13 
seconds to play in the second, the 
Badgers forward cut down the 
right side of the ice and blasted a 
wrist shot past Racine’s glove.

It was a disheartening goal for 

the Wolverines, and a tally that 
breathed life into Wisconsin.

A wild third period capped off 

the entertaining contest.

Compher wasted no time in 

taking the lead back for Michigan, 
jumping into the offensive zone 
and blasting a wrist shot off the 
cross bar just 15 seconds into the 
period.

Just 30 seconds later, the 

Badgers’ Ryan Wagner tied it 
again with his second goal of the 
series. The sophomore forward 
caught 
Michigan 
sophomore 

defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski 

out of position at the blue line, 
and capitalized on a breakaway 
opportunity. Werenski hooked 
Wagner in an attempt to stop a 
goal, but the shot beat Racine 
between the pads.

Fittingly in a game full of 

penalties, it was special teams 
that gave the Wolverines the lead 

late into the period. Sophomore 
forward Dexter Dancs found a 
chance by creating traffic in front 
and lifting a short rebound into the 
upper left corner.

The goal gave Michigan a 

4-3 lead for which Wisconsin 
appeared to have no answer. The 
final 10 minutes were tense, and 
chances abounded on both ends 
of the ice.

And then, with 26.1 seconds 

to play, a Wisconsin forward 
slipped backdoor and buried 
the one-time attempt. The game 
headed to overtime.

“It was just kind of a D-zone 

breakdown,” Motte said. “We 
basically had two guys covering 
three, which makes it tough, 
especially late in the game. They 
found a way to squeeze one 
by. That’s the second time it’s 
happened this year, which makes it 
hurt a little bit more. Five (points) 
of six on the road isn’t too bad, but 
you always want to get six.”

The extra period was wide open, 

with each team taking chances. JT 
Compher sealed the victory with 
his shootout goal, but it didn’t 
erase the sting of how close those 
three points were for Michigan.
