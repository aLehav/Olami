Five speakers shared their 

research in regulating false 
information online to a crowd 
of approximately 50 students 
and faculty members Tuesday 
night at Rackham Assembly 
Hall. The panel, titled “Catching 
Fake 
News,” 
was 
part 
of 

the University of Michigan 
Dissonance Event Series, which 
focuses on the intersection of 
technology, 
privacy, 
policy, 

security and law.

Panelists 
included 
Mark 

Ackerman, 
a 
School 
of 

Information professor, Ceren 
Budak, a School of Information 
assistant professor, Engineering 

professor Rada Mihalcea and 
Fredrik 
Laurin, 
a 
Knight-

Wallace fellow. The panel was 
moderated by Brendan Nyhan, 
a professor in the Ford School of 
Public Policy.

Nyhan opened the event 

by sharing the history of fake 
news. He said fake news is now 
more widely read than ever 
before. Nyhan also said humans 
struggle to handle the volume 
of content they are exposed to 
daily, so machines can be used 
to help ease the issue of volume.

“‘What should we do about it?’ 

is the values question implicated 
here,” Nyhan said. 

Pulitzer 
Prize 
winning 

author 
Heather 
Ann 

Thompson spoke at Literati 
Bookstore on Tuesday night 
as a part of the Sweetland 
Writing Center’s Writer to 
Writer series. As part of the 
series, the center brings in a 
renowned author monthly to 
speak about their work, their 
process and their advice to 
younger writers studying at 
the University of Michigan 
and in the surrounding area.

Thompson 
works 
as 
a 

historian at the University 
in the Departments of Afro-
American 
and 
African 

studies and History as well 
as the Residential College. 
Additionally, Thompson is a 
critically-acclaimed 
author 

with more than 20 awards 
including a Bancroft Prize 
and Pulitzer Prize for her 
book “Blood in the Water: 
The Attica Prison Uprising of 
1971 and its Legacy.” Since its 
release, Thompson has been 
on a neverending press tour for 
“Blood in the Water”, including 
an interview on “The Daily 
Show with Trevor Noah.”

Shelly Manis who works 

at 
the 
Sweetland 
Writing 

Center and runs the Writer to 
Writer Series, conducted the 
interview with Thompson at 
Literati and organized for it 
to be broadcasted live on the 
student radio station WCBN.

Thompson 
first 
revealed 

that she never viewed writing 
as her calling, nor did it come 
naturally to her, which was 
rather discouraging as she 
began to work in her field of 
study.

“Writing is hard and it feels 

like your identity is always 
on display when you try to 
convey something on paper,” 
Thompson said.

Thompson explained that 

once she found “a passion 

for what I wanted to write 
about,” the process seemed to 
flow. She set out as a writer to 
kindle that same passion in her 
readers because the issues that 
she covers are so important to 
surround with conversation. 
She writes in an “accessible” 
manner so that anyone can 
learn from her research.

“I 
wanted 
my 
random 

relatives in Kansas to pick this 
up and go, ‘Oh, this is a page 
turner,’” Thompson remarked.

“Blood 
in 
the 
Water” 

chronicles 
a 
1971 
prison 

uprising at Attica Correctional 
Facility 
in 
New 
York. 

Prisoners had been trying 
to improve their conditions 
legally 
by 
petitioning 
the 

government, but they were 
met with extreme resistance. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
inmates 

staged an uprising, taking the 
prison guards hostage and 
negotiating with the state.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Central Student 
Government 
met 
Tuesday 

to introduce and discuss a 
proposal 
of 
the 
executive 

team’s new liaison program 
to be integrated within all 
campus organizations.

The mission of the program 

is 
to 
provide 
a 
platform 

for 
students 
and 
their 

organizations to externally 
address 
possible 
issues 

within their groups. It also 
aims 
to 
foster 
a 
greater 

connection between campus 
organizations.

According to LSA senior 

Sena Adjei, CSG senior policy 
advisor, this initiative came 
about after concerns arose on 
how to make the campus more 
connected 
and 
make 
CSG 

more visible campus-wide.

“This is the exec team’s 

best answer to one of the 
most serious ills that campus 
has seen,” Adjei said. “The 
University of Michigan is such 
a big campus and exists in a 
bunch of completely isolated

This 
month, 
a 
team 
of 

political 
scientists 
known 

as the Bright Line Watch 
released 
a 
study 
showing 

that Republicans, Democrats 
and independents are all more 
likely to support candidates 
that respect independent legal 
investigations. 
Bright 
Line 

Watch works to monitor the 
state of U.S. democracy and any

Brendan Nyhan, a professor 

in the Ford School of Public 
Policy at the University of 
Michigan and a co-director 
of the Bright Line Watch 
team, co-authored the study 
along with five other political 
scientists. 

The 
study, 
called 

“Party,

democracy 

and 
candidate 
choice 

in 
U.S. 
elections,” 
was 

conducted 
in 
late

about their preferences for 
candidates’ 
policy 
positions 

in a hypothetical upcoming

These findings come 

amid 
former 
Attorney 

General 
Jeff 
Sessions’s 

forced resignation, which 
has left the future of 
special 
counsel 
Robert 

Mueller’s 
investigation 

into Russian involvement 
in 
the 
2016 
election 

unclear. Trump has since 
appointed 
Matthew 

Whitaker 
as 
acting 

attorney general.

According 
to 
the 

study, 35 percent of the 
respondents 
identified 

as 
Republicans 
or 

independents 
who 

lean 
Republican, 
43 

percent as Democrats or 
independents who lean 
Democratic and 17 percent 
as independents with no 
partisan lean.

The 
survey 
found 

candidates 
who 
favor 

political 
control 

over 
independent 

investigations 
instead 

of neutrality were 5.3 
percentage 
points 
less 

likely to win the support of 
Democratic voters, nearly 
four 
percentage 
points 

less likely for Republicans, 
and 
8.1 
percentage 

points less likely among 
independents.

This specific finding 

stood in contrast to the 
others of the study, in 
which there were sharp 
partisan 
divides 
when 

it came to tax policy, 
discrimination 
and 

affirmative 
action 
and 

voting rights.

Nyhan 
said 
he 
was 

surprised by the bipartisan 
support of independent 
investigations.

“I thought the stream 

of attacks by the Trump 
administration 
on 
the 

Mueller investigation and 
on 
unfavorable 
rulings 

by judges would produce 
a wider partisan divide,” 
Nyhan wrote in an email 

CIT Y LIGHTS

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: HOLIDAY CREATES ‘GHOST TOWN’

John James, the 2018 U.S. 

Senate candidate for the state of 
Michigan, is being considered 
by President Donald Trump to 
replace Nikki Haley, ambassador 
to the United Nations, according 
to recent reports.

James, a Republican who 

served as president of James 
Group International, a firm based 
in Detroit, lost the November 
midterm election for one of 
Michigan’s U.S. Senate seats 
to incumbent Democrat Sen. 
Debbie Stabenow. James ran as 
a “conservative outsider who 
supports the Trump agenda,” 
making issues like border security 
and governmental deregulation 
central to his platform. While 
James was ahead of Stabenow for 
much of the evening, once votes 
were counted from metropolitan 
Detroit, 
Stabenow 
defeated 

James with 52.2 percent of the 

state’s votes, compared to James’s 
45.8 percent. This was Stabenow’s 
weakest showing in the polls 
since her election in 2000, when 
she first took office in the Senate.

During the election season, 

many 
state 
and 
national 

Republicans 
promoted 
James 

as a rising star in the party. Both 
Trump and Vice President Mike 
Pence headlined rallies for James. 
Trump endorsed James during 
the Republican primary cycle and 
invited James to the White House 
in September.

According 
to 
Bloomberg, 

James visited the White House 
last week to talk “about an 
administration post with Trump, 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
and Vice President Mike Pence,” 
adding he is being considered 
to take the position of U.N. 
ambassador.

Current ambassador Haley 

served as governor of South 
Carolina from 2011 to 2017 
and 
was 
appointed 
to 
be 

U.N. 
ambassador 
following 

Trump’s election in 2016. It was 
announced in early October that 
Haley will resign at the end of the 
year. According to the Bloomberg 
report, Trump is also considering 
the U.S. ambassadors to France, 
Germany and Canada to take over 
the position.

LSA sophomore Dylan Berger, 

president of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, stated he supports 
any possibility of James serving 
as U.N. ambassador.

“I’m ecstatic because John 

James is one of the most incredible 
public servants that we have in 
our nation at this point … In the 
beginning (of the Senate race) they 
gave him zero shot whatsoever 
against Debbie Stabenow and he 
ended up getting 46 percent of 
the vote and that’s because of who 
he is,” Berger said. “I can’t think 
of anyone that would represent 
our nation better at the United 
Nations than John James would 

and I enthusiastically support 
his nomination to the United 
Nations. I hope that the president 
makes that decision.”

Public Policy junior Katie Kelly, 

who serves as communications 
director 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
expressed concern over James’s 
qualifications to serve in a 
position within foreign relations.

“John James does not hold the 

proper experience required to be 
an effective UN Ambassador,” 
Kelly wrote in an email interview. 
“With no prior experience with 
international politics or as an 
ambassador, James is clearly 
unqualified 
to 
handle 
the 

intricacies of foreign relations. 
We 
need 
qualified 
people 

representing our country on the 
international level. We hope the 
Trump administration will think 
carefully about who they put into 
this position and that they are 
qualified to speak on behalf of the 
United States.”

November 28, 1988

Although 
about 
900,000 

people gathered on the streets 
of 
downtown 
Detroit 
45 

minutes 
away 
to 
celebrate 

Thanksgiving with a parade, 
Ann Arbor was a lonely town. 
“I can’t wait to get out of here 
— who would be staying?” said 
Amy Keen, an LSA sophomore 
on her way home to Tennessee. 
Yet there are a few students 
who stay behind. And for 
them, Thanksgiving break is 
not spent eating turkey with 
their families and watching 
parades. For Marcus Lien, an 
LSA junior from Pittsburg, who 
stayed “because of the money 
and because I had to study,” 

the atmosphere around was a 
pleasant one. “It was really nice. 
I like it better without people, 
the school is really peaceful.” 
Guo Tao, a graduate student 
in Electrical Engineering who 
stayed for the duration said, 
“most of the time I am working 
or at school — the four day 
break gives me lots of free 
time to do my dissertation.” 
For most local businesses, the 
days of Thanksgiving are too 
slow to stay open. “The place 
looks like ghost town,” said 
Stucci’s manager Chris Fisher, 
who closed all his ice cream 
parlours 
for 
Thanksgiving. 

“As far as the University area 
is concerned, all businesses 
are closed,” he said. The only 

restaurant 
opened 
around 

the University was The Great 
Wall. “Thanksgiving is not a 
Chinese Holiday and besides 
we open all year,” said manager 
Chu Monner. “We think some 
people do not go home because 
they have no place to go so 
they could eat here.” Monner 
reported that business was not 
as good as usual, but it was 
better Thursday than Friday. 
Many don’t realize that some 
students stay behind. “I never 
thought about people who do 
not go,” said Daren Stabinski 
an LSA sophomore who left 
last Friday for Florida. “I 
could never really imagine, it 
seems like a time when you 
should go home or have your 

family here,” said Kathleen 
Klonowski a LSA sophomore 
from Saginaw who went home 
but came back early to prepare 
for exams she has this week. 
Yet Klonowski realizes that not 
everyone, including her brother 
from California, can afford 
to go home for Thanksgiving. 
“We really miss him but it is 
impossible for him to come — 
we call him and try to keep the 
tie. He would be home pretty 
soon too.” Lien also held this as 
a consolation. “I’m going home 
in three weeks and with the 
tuition increase I can’t afford 
to go home (more) often.” Last 
evening the “ghost town” came 
back to life. The parking lots 
were full and the streets came 

alive once again. Computer 
centers filled yesterday with 

people on waiting lists trying to 
do their papers for today.

current moment, not a debate. The 
second part of the event featured 
a 
workshop 
for 
developing 

policy recommendations for the 
University.

“This 
event 
is 
first 
and 

foremost a proactive, student-
generated 
response 
to 
the 

administration’s call to gather 
input from stakeholders across 
the University, and its primary 
objective is to gain insights 
and 
recommendations 
from 

a 
diverse, 
multidisciplinary, 

intergenerational 
and 
multi-

ranked 
community 
for 
our 

provost panel’s consideration,” 
De la Cruz said.

The first panelist, Howard 

Brick, 
professor 
in 
the 
Department 

of History, provided a brief 
overview of political regulation 
at the University in the 20th 
century. He noted the American 
Association 
of 
University 

Professors’ 
declaration 
of 

principles on academic freedom 
and academic tenure in relation 
to the University’s history with 
social activism. Brick highlighted 
the precarity of the AAUP’s 
1970 revision of the 1940 
Statement of Principles on 
Academic 
Freedom 
and 

Tenure, explaining how many 
components are undefined of 
what constitutes academic 
freedom versus violation.

“The point was not to avoid 

controversy, but in fact, the 
1970 statement said that the 
scholar could be controversial 
and polemical provided he or 
she was being so for the sake 
of facing scholarship,” he said.

Brick considered periods 

in 
which 
the 
University 

repressed faculty based on 
social 
or 
political 
views, 

drawing from war periods and 
the Cold War. He compared 
these to the social issues faced 
today on campus and the 
AAUP’s letter statement.

“It 
may 
be 
a 
little 

discomforting to recognize 
that 
oddly 
enough, 
the 

question of whether one has 
the right to deny a letter of 
recommendation on grounds 
other than solely merit,” he 
said. “It turns up here in 
the letter, in the context, of 
course, we would not approve 
regarding the disciplining 
of a student, which only 
shows how these questions 
of academic freedom are so 
fraught and dependent on 
context, and not fixed by 
nature as an absolute.”

The 
second 
panelist, 

Chandler 
Davis, 
was 
a 

University professor in the ’50s 
and was given a subpoena from 
the 
House 
Un-American 

Activities 
Committee 
along 

with three other U-M faculty 
for being branded a communist. 
Davis refused to answer HUAC 
questions, pleading the Fifth 
Amendment in the hopes of 
being convicted and appealing 
the case to the Supreme Court to 
protest against the government-
sponsored 
anti-communist 

campaign. Davis was ultimately 
fired from the University, lost his 
appeal to the Supreme Court and 
served a six-month sentence in 
prison.

“Any faculty member refusing 

to answer questions before the 
red hunter committees created 
a 
presumption 
of 
unfitness, 

I 
summarize 
the 
plight 

administrators face this way: 
They hoped there were no reds 
on the faculty, they hoped nobody 
would ask them if they were, but 
if the inquisitors obliged them 
to fire a red they would go along 
wholeheartedly,” Davis said.

The third speaker, Alan Wald, 

a professor emeritus of American 
Culture and English, compared 
his social activism as a professor 

in the ’70s and ’80s against 
apartheid in South Africa and that 
of the Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions movement in regard to 
Israel. According to Wald, both 
movements focused on economic 
targeting and have a history of 
colonization at the root of the 
problem. He also acknowledged 
the implications and history of 
the oppression of Jewish people 
searching 
for 
survival 
upon 

coming to Israel, and explained 
how discourse at the University 
is vital to understanding the 
multifaceted issue.

“I’ve 
heard 
it 
mentioned 

that everybody supported the 
anti-apartheid struggle,” Wald 
said. “That’s as misleading as 
imagining that the beginning 
of the movement against the 
war in Vietnam that everybody 
supported it. The battle for 
divestment from apartheid went 
on for close to 20 years, day in 
and day out for the core activists 
and U-M was far behind many 
universities. 

Despite 
nearly 
ubiquitous 

news coverage and relatively 
civil negotiations, New York 
state troopers came in with 
force. The troopers tortured the 
inmates but would come to deny 
such proceedings. There were 39 
fatalities.

“This 
book 
is 
about 
the 

uprising, but it was also about 
the coverup,” Thompson.

Thompson spent 13 years 

researching and writing “Blood 
in the Water”. New York sealed 
their archives regarding the 
Attica 
riot, 
so 
Thompson 

said she had to retrieve the 
 

information in a roundabout 
way.

“The 
thing 
about 
being 

a historian, it’s like being a 
detective,” Thompson said. “You 
have to think about where’s the 
secret. Who knows where the 
sources are? That’s the fun part. 
It’s amazing how creative you 
can be. Believe me, the stuff is 
there. You just have to look for 
it.”

Thompson looked at union 

records for prison guards and 
coroner’s reports for autopsies. 
She interviewed inmates, prison 
guards 
and 
state 
troopers 

alike in order to offer every 
perspective.

“Who’s really telling the truth 

of the narrative?” Thompson 
said. “That’s kind of the most 
vexing thing.”

Thompson said she views it as 

her responsibility as a historian 
to tell stories comprehensively 
to the best of her ability. She 
said this is compounded by her 
privilege as a white woman 
covering such volatile research 
regarding race and ethnicity. 
She assured the audience that 

she is “not pretending that it’s 
my story.”

“I see that as a privilege, but 

I also see it as an obligation 
to figure out what the hell 
happened and report back,” 
Thompson said.

Thompson’s 
work 
revolves 

around this idea of responsibility 
to find the truth. Her favorite 
kind of writing is not weighty, 
academic 
works, 
but 
rather 

breaking news opinion pieces 
regarding 
current 
affairs. 

Thompson called this her work 
as a public intellectual and 
describes it as trying “to correct 
the record in the moment.”

Thompson writes often on 

issues 
regarding 
police 
and 

prisons. Public Policy junior 
Bhavya 
Sukhavasi 
said 
she 

enjoyed the fact that Thompson 
delved into this aspect of her 
work at the event.

“It isn’t just about writing a 

professional book, but writing 
just day-to-day,” Sukhavasi said.

Thompson told the audience 

about 
an 
opportunity 
that 

she had to write an op-ed 
for 
The 
New 
York 
Times 

regarding a recent prison riot 
in South Carolina. She publicly 
condemned the story of the 
police — claiming they were not 
telling the whole truth.

Following 
the 
release 
of 

Thompson’s 
op-ed, 
inmates 

came forward with videos from 
inside the prison during the riots 
that confirmed the misdeeds 
of the police. Thompson said 
she enjoys being able to write 
important 
stories 
using 
her 

historical expertise in order to 
facilitate a dialogue about the 
issues at hand.

“There’s 
no 
choice,” 

Thompson said. “You weigh in 
now or you don’t. You write now 
or you don’t.”

It is with this courage that 

Thompson advised her students 
to write. She said she is happiest 
when it seems her students 
portray “a confidence to have 
some mastery of the sources 
rather than the sources master 
them.”

“They need to just have some 

confidence in their own voice,” 
Thompson said. “You kind of 
have to have a little bit of that 
bravery to step in front of it like 
that.”

Julie 
Babcock, 
a 
lecturer 

in 
Sweetland 
Center 
for 

Writing said as an educator, 
she reverberated Thompson’s 
sentiments 
regarding 
the 

necessity for students to present 
confidence in their writing.

“We 
want 
to 
hear 
your 

thoughts, and we want to see you 
engage in such conversations,” 
Babcock said.

In sharing her experience, 

Thompson said she finds one 
of her most important roles is 
instilling hope in her students 
suffering the frustrations of 
entering into writing.

“It’s so overwhelming when 

you’re in it,” Thompson said. 
“It’s important that students 
understand 
all 
the 
barriers 

you have also faced and how 
you overcame them to kind 
of brainstorm strategies for 
moving forward.”

Thompson 
is 
currently 

researching for her next book 
on the bombing of a building 
housing MOVE Black liberation 
activists in Philadelphia in the 
spring of 1985. This past year, 
she was awarded the Bearing 
Witness 
Writing 
Fellowship 

from the Ford Foundation’s Art 
of Justice Fund to allow her to 
conduct more research. Next 
year, she will be teaching at 
Cambridge University and she 
plans to release her next book in 
about three years.

interview. “I find those results 
encouraging - they are a valuable 
reminder that most people don’t 
follow politics very closely and 
that many democratic norms 
still enjoy bipartisan support.”

Both representatives from the 

University’s chapter of College 
Republicans and chapter of 
College Democrats, however, 
said they were not surprised 
by the bipartisan support for 
independent 
investigations. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Dylan 

Berger, president of College 
Republicans, said the study 
reaffirmed what he already 
knew.

“I 
don’t 
think 
that 
(the 

finding) surprised me because in 
this country, it’s very important 
that we put conservative and 
liberal aside and do what’s 
right, and I think the majority 
of people want to make sure that 
we’re bridging those divides and 
have good government,” Berger 
said.

Public 
Policy 
junior 

Katie 
Kelly, 
director 
of 

communications 
for 
College 

Democrats, said she was also 
unsurprised by the results.

“I 
don’t 
think 
that 
this 

finding 
is 
that 
surprising,” 

Kelly said. “In a country where 
bipartisanship has become more 
difficult to achieve than ever 
before, it is very important that 
we focus on the issues that we 
all agree on. This survey shows 
that the majority of Americans 
are united on this particular 
issue, 
not 
just 
Democrats, 

Republicans, or independents.”

The study cautions readers 

from interpreting the bipartisan 
support 
for 
independent 

investigations 
in 
an 
overly 

optimistic 
way. 
As 
Nyhan 

pointed 
out, 
even 
though 

Democrats 
and 
Republicans 

may believe the same underlying 
principle, they could potentially 
interpret 
the 
meaning 
of 

an 
“independent 
and 
fair” 

investigation in different ways.

“As we describe, it is possible 

for a consensus to exist on 
various democratic principles 
but for partisans to disagree 
sharply on how to interpret 
or apply those principles in 
particular 
cases,” 
Nyhan 

wrote. “Imagine two people 
who say investigations should 
be impartial but one opposes 
political interference in the 
Mueller investigation and the 
other thinks the investigation 
is a partisan ‘witch hunt’ that 
should therefore be shut down.”

The study raises questions 

about how the U.S. electorate will 
react if Mueller’s investigation is 
ended prematurely by Whitaker. 
Both College Republicans and 
College Democrats say they 
have conversations within their 
organizations about the Mueller 
probe.

Berger said he is confident 

President Donald Trump will 
allow Mueller’s investigation 
to 
be 
carried 
through 
to 

completion, while Kelly saidshe 
saw real concern among voters 
when canvassing before the 
midterm 
elections 
that 
the 

investigation would be cut short.

“Outside of our members, I 

personally saw a good amount 
of 
discussion 
on 
the 
issue 

when knocking doors during 
the election cycle,” Kelly said. 
“Many people were concerned 
about the investigation being 
cut 
short. 
We 
in 
College 

Democrats share that concern. 
It is important that Robert 
Mueller has the appropriate 
time and resources to complete 
a full investigation.”

Another major finding of the 

study was that parties divide 
sharply on the issue of voting 
rights. Based on the survey, the 
public ranked the importance 
of equal voting rights very high, 
with 89 percent of respondents 
calling it important or essential, 
but the two parties perceive 
this 
democratic 
principle 

differently. 
Republicans 
are 

concerned with enforcing equal 
voting 
rights 
by 
combating 

voter fraud, while Democrats 
are focused on protecting voter 
rights by ensuring equal access 
to the ballot box.

Nyhan made the distinction 

that widespread voter fraud 
is not an issue the U.S. faces, 
whereas voter suppression of 
marginalized groups does exist.

“The problem is there’s a 

factual misperception at the 
heart of this dispute,” Nyhan 
wrote. “Every serious inquiry 
has shown that widespread voter 
fraud is virtually nonexistent. 
By contrast, the risk of voter ID 
laws creating undue burdens 
on voters from disadvantaged 
groups is real.” He also pointed 
out, though, that the literature 
is mixed as to whether stricter 
voter ID laws do reduce voter 
turnout.

Berger said it is important 

to 
both 
protect 
Americans’ 

constitutional right to vote and 
ensure that only those that are 
supposed to vote actually go out 
and vote. He said he believes 
voter fraud is one of the most 
important issues facing our 
country.

“I would really like to see both 

sides become more interested 

in protecting from voter fraud 
because if you have voter fraud 
going on in this country, our 
election system will not be able 
to stand up, because in order to 
retain legitimacy, you’ve got to 
make sure that only those that 
are supposed to vote actually 
vote,” Berger said.

Kelly 
affirmed 
College 

Democrats are concerned about 
voter suppression across the 
United States.

“Both as College Democrats 

and as college students, we know 
firsthand that voter suppression 
is a problem in this country,” 
Kelly said. “As stated in the 
survey, research has shown that 
voter fraud is not a problem 
in this country. I think that 
elections like those in Georgia 
show that we have a long way to 
go to ensure equal voting rights 
for every American citizen.”

Kelly is referring to voter 

suppression efforts in Georgia 
during the midterm elections, 
in which Brian Kemp, governor-
elect and former secretary of 
state of Georgia, purged the 
voter rolls prior to the election, 
under 
the 
justification 
of 

removing people who haven’t 
voted in recent elections, as 
well as those who had died. 
His office held 53,000 voter 
registrations, nearly 70 percent 
of which were Black voters, 
because the name used on the 
registration did not exactly 
match 
one 
on 
government 

records. When ending her bid 
for governor, Kemp’s opponent 
Stacey 
Abrams 
lamented 

an “erosion of democracy” that 
she believed kept some of her 
supporters from voting.

Looking 
forward, 
Nyhan 

believes 
the 
study 
has 

implications 
for 
the 
2020 

presidential 
election, 
mainly 

in 
the 
general 
election 
if 

Trump’s 
democratic 
norm 

violations 
contribute 
to 
his 

underperformance in the polls.

“His approval ratings are well 

below what we’d expect given 
the state of the economy,” Nyhan 
said. “If Trump continues to 
underperform because of factors 
like democratic norm violations, 
it could put him at greater risk of 
defeat in 2020.”

Both Berger and Kelly said 

they think the study indicates 
the American electorate will 
want a candidate who can put 
the needs of the country over 
party and respect American 
democratic institutions.

“I think this survey shows 

that 
there 
are 
issues 
that 

Americans agree upon,” Kelly 
said. “Future candidates must 
focus on uniting our country 
instead of dividing it.”

pockets and CSG has not 
been 
effective 
enough 
in 

accessing those pockets and 
making sure they are seen 
by us and supported by us, so 
we are going out to them, we 
are asking them to come to us 
and meet with us regularly 
so we can serve with them 
regularly.”

The proposed organization 

of the program is to use 
a cohort system in which 
student organizations will 
be separated into groups. 
To determine the groups, 
CSG offered organizations 
several different categories, 
such as “service,” “identity” 
and 
“professional,” 
which 

they could place themselves 
into. 
To 
best 
represent 

their groups, organizations 
had 
the 
option 
to 
place 

themselves 
group 
into 

multiple categories.

“In 
the 
conversations 

to see how we can really 
empower the students and 
give them the platform, we 
decided to compartmentalize 
student orgs based on their 
identities and based on their 
missions,” LSA sophomore 
Jacob Pollitt, CSG external 
relations 
officer, 
said. 

“Hopefully by bringing them 
together, they’ll be able to 
share 
their 
experiences, 

share 
their 
information, 

begin to understand sort of 
how similar orgs face similar 
issues and maybe how they’re 
different and how through 
the collaboration they can 
sort of help each other with 
the issues that they face.”

Every student organization 

will appoint a liaison who 
will work with Adjei and 
Pollitt. 
Each 
liaison 
will 

funnel into a cohort, which 
will interact directly with 
CSG to create action plans, 
facilitate 
activities 
and 

provide necessary resources 
through bi-weekly meetings. 

As part of the program, 

CSG would collaborate with 
student 
organizations 
to 

establish 
workshops 
and 

seminars for the groups to 
attend, potentially discussing 
topics 
such 
as 
money 

management, technology and 
social media.

“The seminars that we 

are going to be hosting, they 
optimize 
the 
benefits 
of 

organizations,” Adjei said. 
“Workshops can focus on 
ways 
the 
administration 

as an entity can work with 
organizations more directly 
to 
remove 
barriers 
that 

they’re facing or to help their 
agendas.”

According to Pollitt, the 

liaison program will provide 
multiple 
short-term 
and 

long-term benefits for the 
University. 
Some 
benefits 

include 
opportunities 
to 

build networks, being able 
to use CSG as a platform 
for advocacy and increased 
accessibility 
of 
CSG 

initiatives.

“Accessibility 
to 
other 

CSG 
projects, 
current 

and future, that’s a really 
important thing to touch 
on,” Pollitt said. “We do have 
projects in the work and the 
Liaison Program will sort 
of smooth the way in terms 
of implementation that not 
only will benefit the student 
orgs and their experience on 
campus, but also will help 

CSG achieve the visibility 
that is necessary.”

During the presentation, 

LSA 
sophomore 
Amanda 

Kaplan, CSG vice chair of 
the 
finance 
committee, 

raised a concern about the 
logistics behind integrating 
student organizations with 
a 
pre-established 
internal 

governmental structure.

“What is your plan for 

different types of student 
groups that kind of already 
have 
an 
established 

government hierarchy like 
sorority 
and 
fraternity 

life, how are you going to 
incorporate them into other 
cohorts?” Kaplan asked.

In response, Adjei and 

Pollitt said even if groups 
such 
as 
sororities 
and 

fraternities 
already 
have 

their 
own 
hierarchy, 
by 

coming to CSG, they can 
receive additional help and 
have an additional resource 
to overcome any barriers. 
Ultimately, they said, CSG 
would just be an additional 
platform to help make their 
voices 
and 
perspectives 

heard.

Toward the end of their 

presentation, 
Adjei 
and 

Pollitt proposed their goals 
for the program in the next 
five 
years, 
stating 
they 

hope for an annual summit, 
guest presenters, consulting 
sessions and more.

“Ideally we want the entire 

campus to be in on this,” 
Adjei said. “In five years we 
want to be up and running 
fully efficiently at maximum 
velocity. 
We 
want 
every 

corner of campus to at least 
know that we are there as a 
resource and have a direct 
line to us.”

T

his 
year, 
I 
recently 
enrolled 
in 
the 
Ross 
School of Business from 
the College of Literature, Science 
and Arts to be on track for 
pursuing dual degrees in English 
and Business. Now that the first 
semester is nearly over, I’ve 
noticed some notable differences 
between 
the 
schools. 
More 
specifically, I’ve found that the 
Business School is very different 
from what I expected.
One key difference is that the 
Business School focuses on the 
future while LSA focuses on the 
present. As a Business student, 
I’ve noticed that I am constantly 
pushed to think about the future: 
There are recruiters in the Winter 
Garden most days and I constantly 
overhear people talking about 
upcoming interviews and job 
offers. 
Every 
sophomore 
is 
required to create a résumé and 
refine it until we get a certain 
score on an online résumé grader 
— VMock — as part of one of our 
classes.
In contrast, my LSA professors 
rarely discuss our future careers, 
and instead will only ask about 
my major. Sometimes, they’ll 
ask whether or not I have any 
idea what kind of career I want 
to pursue. Granted, most of my 
courses were humanities and 
social science-related, so I don’t 
know if this is the same in other 
disciplines. I’ve also found that 
my LSA professors are much more 
likely to discuss current issues 
than my Business professors are 
(though instructors in general 
usually shy away from such 
topics), and that the coursework 
more easily ties in with non-
business related current events 
than my Ross coursework does.
Other differences include the 
ambience: While LSA courses 
are so diverse and plentiful that 
defining an exact atmosphere is 
impossible, Ross is most decidedly 
cutthroat and stressful. This is 
largely due to the Business School 
distribution (or the “Ross curve”) 
that assigns a certain percentage of 
students to a grade range for each 
class. While this system suggests 
that receiving good grades in 
Ross courses is easy, the exams 
are extremely difficult, making it 
difficult to receive an A. Moreover, 
because 
of 
the 
distribution, 
students don’t necessarily have 
to do well on the exams to receive 
a good grade: They just need to 
do better than their peers. This 
creates an extremely competitive 
atmosphere in which students are 

constantly worried about their 
peers’ performances just as much 
as they are worried about their 
own.
Interestingly, 
the 
Business 
School also places a great deal of 
importance on teamwork. Most 
of our assignments are completed 
in groups and often take hours to 
finish, requiring students to meet 
with their teams on a regular 
basis. We’re provided with tutors 
who are available multiple times 
a week, as well as peer advisors 
with whom we can speak should 
we have any questions about 
academics or recruiting.
This stark contrast between the 
nature of the distribution, which 
pits students against each other, 
and the need to work in teams, 
which connects students, baffles 
me. How can a school that stresses 
the importance of collaboration 
in every part of its curriculum 
use a grading system that fosters 
unhealthy competition among its 
students? I do understand that 
the grading system does mimic 
the business world — people in 
business all compete for the same 
opportunities. However, having 
to work with other students 
while knowing that they probably 
secretly want me to fail my exams 
so that they do better, and at 
times feeling the same way about 
them, makes me feel as though 
our collaboration is marred by 
superficiality. This isn’t to say 
that Business students don’t care 
about each other — students in 
the Business School commiserate 
about their shared classes (we all 
take the same core courses) and 
are always much more willing to 
help each other than I’ve noticed 
students in my LSA courses are.
The part about the Business 
School that surprised me the 
most, however, is how different 
it is from its reputation, which 
can be surmised in one word: 
Rosshole. There’s a clear image 
of who exactly a “Rosshole” is: 
He’s a rich white guy from New 
York whose parents work on Wall 
Street. He wears Patagonia and 
Canada Goose, interned or plans 
to intern at Goldman Sachs and is 
a frat bro. He rides a Bird around 
campus in a suit. Do these types 
of students exist in the Business 
School? 
Absolutely. 
However, 
they don’t make up the entire 
student population, and the term 
“Rosshole” is based on mostly 
false assumptions.
There’s a statement that a 
senior at the Business School 
I spoke with last year told me 

that sums up what it is like as a 
student at the business school. She 
said that if I do join the Business 
School, I’ll meet both the best and 
worst people I’ll ever meet. This 
is pretty spot on. I’ve met some 
really wonderful people at the 
Business School whom I hope I 
can continue to get to know even 
after I graduate. Most people in 
the Business School, including 
people I don’t even know, have 
extended offers to help me with 
anything I need, whether that 
be with fine-tuning my résumé, 
completing my homework or just 
venting about school. I’ve only met 
a couple of people who I wouldn’t 
mind never seeing again.
In addition, the awful people 
at the Business School aren’t 
exceptionally meaner or more 
annoying than the generic asshole 
(more 
high-strung, 
maybe). 
But the truth is that there are 
annoying and privileged people 
everywhere. Business students 
aren’t special in that department. 
“LSAhole” just doesn’t have the 
same ring to it that “Rosshole” 
has — and truthfully, because 
the 
Rosshole 
stereotype 
has 
little merit, I find the term to be 
strangely endearing.
Of course, the Business School 
is far from perfect. According 
to the Office of the Registrar, 
about 63 percent of students 
enrolled as of fall 2018 are male, 
while only about 37 percent are 
female. There are also 2,208 
white students out of the 4,223 
enrolled and only 142 Black 
students 
and 
218 
Hispanic 
students. These numbers belie 
the need for more diversity in 
the Business School, and while 
they have been becoming more 
even in recent years, Ross must 
be held responsible for working 
towards more diversity.
Therefore, stereotypes such as 
the “Rosshole” that are parroted 
by students are mostly untrue and 
oversimplify the real problem of 
diversity in the Business School 
and the University as a whole. 
As a student enrolled in both 
the Business School and LSA, 
it’s become clear to me that the 
strange tension between the two 
schools that is unnecessary and 
founded on misguided beliefs. 
Being in both schools certainly 
requires finesse at times, but 
it shouldn’t be because of any 
friction between the two schools.

I

n December, world leaders will 
gather in Katowice, Poland 
for the 24th Conference of 
the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, dubbed COP24, to review 
the ongoing implementation of the 
2015 Paris agreement and discuss 
the next steps in combating climate 
change. An air of fresh urgency 
surrounds the summit following 
the release of a special report from 
the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, which warned of 
catastrophic consequences unless 
the world cuts its carbon emissions, 
substantially and immediately.
The conference comes shortly after 
the publication of an ominous U.S. 
government report last week. The 
report projects climate change will 
cost hundreds of billions of dollars 
due to extreme weather, decreasing 
agricultural yields, fatal heat waves, 
the spread of vector-borne diseases 
and other adverse health effects, 
ultimately shrinking the American 
economy and endangering millions 
of lives.
Despite withdrawing from the 
Paris agreement, President Donald 
Trump’s 
administration 
will 
send representatives to Katowice. 
However, rather than participate 
in 
meaningful 
discourse, 
the 
American delegation plans to give 
a presentation on the merits of coal. 
Yes, at an international summit to 
combat climate change, the Trump 
administration will be promoting the 
dirtiest fossil fuel.
Trump’s refusal to acknowledge 
the climatic impacts of coal is 
absurd, but frankly unsurprising 
given his long history of denying 
human-caused climate change and 
its grave implications. Trump and 
the Republican Party’s stubborn 
refusal to believe proven climate 
science contributes to the American 
public’s ignorance on the matter, 
particularly amongst their base. A 
majority of Republicans don’t believe 
humans cause climate change and 

say the seriousness of global warming 
is exaggerated. The result is the 
extreme politicization of what should 
be a nonpartisan, non-controversial 
issue. After all, with the exception of 
the U.S., every country in the world 
— including those ruled by both left-
wing and right-wing governments — 
is part of the Paris agreement.
While the rest of the world seems 
committed to solving the issue of 
climate change, this is not an issue 
that can be solved without American 

involvement. The U.S. is the world’s 
second-highest emitter, accounting 
for 15 percent of total emissions in 
2015 and has among the highest 
emissions per capita. Given the 
urgency of action outlined in the latest 
IPCC report, the world simply cannot 
afford for any major country, much 
less the U.S., to not aggressively cut 
emissions if the world is to avoid the 
severe consequences of warming in 
excess of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The U.S. 
prides itself on being a global leader, 
but when it comes to international 
efforts to alleviate climate change, 
the U.S. has shown little interest in 
participating, much less leading.
The scary thing is that the Paris 
agreement was just the first step of 
many in truly cutting emissions. The 
agreement instructed each country 
to devise its own emissions reduction 
target and a plan to reach it, but it 
stopped short of requiring a certain 
level of emissions cuts by any given 
time or mandating certain types 
of emissions-cutting mechanisms. 
The agreement was obviously a 
significant first step, but countries 
must now reevaluate their targets to 

ensure the world collectively reaches 
the 1.5 degrees Celcius target (or get 
as close as possible), and establish a 
concrete plan of action to achieve their 
individual targets then.
Emissions reductions will not 
happen automatically. Governments 
must be prepared to implement 
policies to guide the economy to 
lower emissions levels. There are 
two main ways to do this. First, by 
implementing carbon pricing through 
either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade 
system, which forces companies and 
consumers to consider the external 
costs (i.e. climate change costs) of 
carbon emissions. This way is the 
most efficient and effective but 
also the most politically difficult 
to accomplish — President Barack 
Obama tried to establish a cap-and-
trade system in the early years of 
his presidency but failed, despite 
Democratic majorities in Congress. 
The second way is through a bundle 
of individual regulations, such as 
fuel efficiency standards in cars and 
subsidies for renewable energies. 
In this realm, President Trump 
is derailing existing regulations, 
lowering fuel efficiency standards, 
slashing 
funding 
for 
renewable 
energy research and development 
and proposing subsidies for derelict 
coal-fired power plants to keep them 
profitable.
These actions defy logic and have 
serious implications. The time for 
dragging our feet has passed. The 
world has an extremely narrow 
window to address climate change, 
yet the Trump administration is 
pulling the U.S. backward. U.S. non-
involvement will sink international 
efforts, and that will sink the planet. 
The upcoming conference in Katowice 
is a reminder that the current U.S. 
response to climate change is not just 
inadequate, it is pitiful.

There is also a new caveat that 
allows both the accuser and the 
accused to cross-examine each 
other through an adviser or lawyer 
in what will essentially become a 
full-on trial that colleges are not 
necessarily trained to handle. It 
also creates a narrower definition 
of sexual assault, referring to it 
as an act “so severe, pervasive 
and objectively offensive that it 
effectively denies a person equal 
access to the school’s education 
program or activity.” This will 
make the line between what is and 
is not considered sexual assault 
blurrier and effectively harder 
to prove in this new courtroom-
type setting. In essence, these 
new proposals set forth a rhetoric 
that aligns with the air of doubt 
so often attributed to sexual 
assault survivors. The Michigan 
Daily Editorial Board opposes 
the new proposals and urges the 
University to continue to support 
survivors in the face of these 
changes.
Most at stake with the new 
proposals is the fact that the 
University not only has a recent 
history of sexual assault cases but 
the existing investigation process, 
though comprehensive, has flaws 
in implementation. New proposals 
would build upon an already 
unstable investigation process. 
Just recently, the University has 
faced several sexual assault cases. 
Samuel Schultz, a New York-
based baritone, accused School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance professor 
David 
Daniels 
and 
Daniels’s 
husband Scott Walters of sexual 
assault. Daniels has taken a leave 
of absence from the University 
but still denies the allegations. 
An investigation is active but 
no arrests have been made, 
according to The Daily. In another 
instance, a senior in the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance reported 
being sexually assaulted by her 

Graduate Student Instructor. As 
highlighted by The Daily, the 
student’s experience with the 
current Title IX reporting process 
was tedious and slow. These are 
just a handful of the known Title 
IX cases that have occurred at the 
University. We can only imagine 

how many more instances like 
this have affected students across 
campus.
The new Title IX rules will also 
essentially make schools less liable 
for sexual assault charges. Under 
the new proposal, schools are 
only responsible for investigating 
if they have “actual knowledge” 
of the assault, meaning a formal 
complaint would have to be 
correctly reported to the right 
person or group to take care of 
the claim. Not only does this 
inhibit the reporting procedure, 
but the requirement of “actual 
knowledge” 
inherently 
casts 
doubt 
on 
those 
who 
come 
forward.
In a similar affront to reporting 
procedures, schools are no longer 
required to deal with off-campus 
assaults, where 68 percent of the 
student body live and where many 
sexual assaults may occur. Victims 
must also prove their case through 
“clear and convincing evidence,” 
making proof of sexual assault 
elevated to a higher caliber. This 
is in stark contrast to the lower 
evidentiary 
level 
established 

by President Barack Obama’s 
administration. With the ease of 
liability, the new provisions could 
make the investigating procedure 
more difficult for survivors and 
also further deter universities 
from 
taking 
action. 
This 
is 
unsurprising, given the amount 
of time and money that goes into 
a sexual assault investigation, 
and the damage it can do to a 
school’s 
reputation. 
Instead 
of 
supporting 
sexual 
assault 
survivors, DeVos, responsible for 
the true well-being of students, 
has proactively inhibited the 
reporting process and effectively 
introduced proposals espousing a 
rhetoric and subsequent actions 
that do the opposite of protecting 
student’s well-being.
With these new rules close 
to being enacted, we implore 
the University, and all other 
universities 
and 
colleges, 
to 
hold itself to higher standards. 
The University owes it to its 
students, past and future, to 
keep survivors and students in 
mind when navigating these 
cases, and most importantly, safe 
from harm. For those who have 
been affected by sexual assault 
and violence, we encourage you 
not to be deterred by these rule 
changes. Your experience matters 
and your safety is of the utmost 
importance.

harder to prosecute through new Title IX rules. In an overhaul of 
campus sexual assault rules, DeVos reduced the liability of colleges and

THEATRE REVIEW

TV REVIEW

“come out and 

play”

Billie Eilish

Interscope Records

The 
night 
that 
Brett 

Kavanaugh was confirmed as 
an Associate Justice of the U.S. 
Supreme Court was bitterly 
cold outside. Early October — 
too early to dig out your winter 
jacket, but too late for thin 
windbreakers. As I was leaving 
a restaurant with my friend, I 
glanced up at the TV screen set 
on CNN news: “Breaking News: 
Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to 
U.S. Supreme Court.”

The 
hundreds 
of 
sexual 

abuse 
victims 
stepping 

forward to tell their stories had 
shattered my spirit over and 
over again this year, but this 
seemed like the icing on the 
cake. Then my friend asked, 
“Who’s Brett Kavanaugh?” 

The terrible thing about 

ignorance is that it’s so easy. 
It takes no effort at all to push 

away the world around you and 
focus on more pressing things, 
such as exams or what you’re 
doing 
Friday 
night. 
That’s 

why, when I saw Musket’s 
production of “Cabaret” at 
the Power Center this past 
weekend, I knew it was vital to 
our times. 

Musket, 
the 
largest 

student-run musical theatre 
organization at the University, 
puts on one Broadway-style 
production 
per 
semester. 

“Cabaret” 
was 
their 
latest 

musical venture, set in 1929 
Berlin — the most liberal city 
in Germany with a vibrant, 
sultry nightlife that openly 
embraced 
homosexuality 
— 

four 
years 
before 
Hitler’s 

appointment as Chancellor of 
Germany. The story follows the 
relationship between Clifford 
Bradshaw, a visiting American 
novelist played by LSA Fifth 
Year Casey Board, and Sally 
Bowles, a cabaret singer played 

by SMTD Sophomore Caroline 
Glazier. “Cabaret,” based on 
the play by John Van Druten, 
was directed by SMTD and 
LSA Junior Isabel K. Olsen 
and choreographed by SMTD 
Sophomore Johanna Kepler. 

“Cabaret” opened in a burst 

of energy with “Willkommen,” 
which welcomed audiences to 
the seedy Berlin Kit Kat Klub. 
Emcee Wilson Plonk (SMTD 
Junior) 
deserves 
special 

mention 
for 
his 
excellent, 

exuberant 
performance. 

Plonk 
skillfully 
embodied 

the 
overwhelming 
passion 

of Berlin in the 1920s while 
simultaneously 
keeping 
the 

audience at ease with the 
flamboyant backdrop of the 
production. 

Musket did a wonderful job 

of giving the audience glimpses 
at 
the 
underlying 
fascist 

regime 
while 
maintaining 

that, on the surface, life still 
contained parties and wild 

TRINA PAL

Daily Arts Writer

Musket puts on pertinent 
performance of ‘Cabaret’

entertainment. 
“Money,” 

a 
number 
evolving 
from 

embracing 
the 
grandeur 

of 
wealth 
to 
desperation 

at not having it, was the 
performance’s first look at 
the dichotomy of Germany 
in the 1920s. After using the 
first half of the production to 
establish 
relationships 
and 

set 
the 
scene, 
“Tomorrow 

Belongs 
to 
Me,” 
directly 

before intermission, stunned 
the audience with its sudden 
display of the hidden Nazi 
culture in Berlin. Clifford’s 
friend revealed an armband 
emblazoned 
with 
a 
black 

swastika and the cheerful, 
sultry dancing changed to 
dark, ominous stomping. 

As 
a 
character, 
Sally 

Bowles chose to ignore the 
hints of Hitler’s rise even 
when 
blatantly 
obvious. 

Glazier’s rendition of “Maybe 
This Time,” reflecting her 
happiness 
at 
finally 
being 

in a stable relationship with 
Clifford, was artfully done and 
did justice to her character. 
Sally stays in-denial, singing: 
“Life is a cabaret old chum,” 
until 
the 
very 
end. 
The 

simplicity of detachment is 
written all over her face, but 
the audience senses the danger 

in remaining idle, a message 
incredibly 
relevant 
to 
our 

current political climate. 

The second half of “Cabaret” 

included the memorable “What 
Would You Do?” performed by 
Fraulein 
Schneider 
(SMTD 

Sophomore Samantha Buyers), 
a poor landlord in love with 
a 
Jewish 
fruit-seller 
Herr 

Schultz (SMTD Junior Aaron 
Robinson). Fraulein Schneider 
ends her engagement to Herr 
Schultz in the wake of the 
Nazis’ rise to power, but Herr 
Schultz firmly believes that “it 
will pass,” even after bricks are 
thrown through his window in 
an effort to drive him out of 
town.

Denial can only persevere 

for so long. The last scene 
shows 
a 
spotlight 
shining 

on a missing orchestra, with 
instruments lying haphazardly 
across the floor and music 
stands upended, but music 
continued to play. We see the 
Emcee rip off his suit to reveal 
an 
inmate’s 
concentration 

camp uniform with a bullet 
hole in his chest, while other 
members of the cast, wearing 
white, stare at a bright light 
in the middle of the stage. 
Strobe lights flash on and off 
and we see the cast contort, 

as if being shot, before finally 
collapsing, lifeless. Everyone 
is taken in the end — the 
orchestra, the cast, even the 
audience. Seeing intricately 
developed characters die is 
heartbreaking, 
reminding 

us of the full consequences 
of Hitler’s power and how 
the 
current 
sociopolitical 

divide in the U.S. seems to be 
converging on the same path. 

A musical as relevant as 

“Cabaret” was a wonderful 
selection, but I would have 
liked to see more explicit 
connections 
to 
our 
times. 

“Cabaret” is a wake-up call for 
its audience, but still largely 
sticks to the original script. 
Deviations to move from the 
past to the present would 
have allowed the audience 
to resonate more with the 
message. 

“Cabaret” shows us how 

easily one can focus on the 
beauty of the world and ignore 
the 
reality. 
This 
country 

currently hosts a president 
who openly shames women, 
racial minorities and the queer 
community. How long can we 
keep up this complacency? 
Letting our minds become 
numb to atrocities is as good 
as joining the perpetrator. 

ALEC COHEN / DAILY

No matter how many Nicki 

Swift videos accuse Catherine 
Zeta-Jones (“Red 2”) of being 
one of the haughtiest stars in 
Hollywood, I constantly find 
myself arguing in her defense. 
What is it about her that draws 
my unwavering allegiance? Is 
it her marriage to fine wine 
Michael Douglas (“Ant-Man 
and the Wasp”)? Is it because 
I cannot separate her from 
her character of Velma Kelly 
in the 2002 adaptation of 
“Chicago”? Or is it because 
she has mastered an American 
accent despite hailing from 
Wales? It’s probably Michael 
Douglas, but while the actress 
reportedly may not be a delight 
to work with, she consistently 
turns out a great performance 
no matter the quality of the 
project. Zeta-Jones can act 
her ass off, and nowhere is this 
superhuman ability to salvage 
a script as evident as in “Queen 
America.”

Much like its central star, 

I have mixed opinions about 
“Queen America.” Due to the 
irreversible trauma inflicted 
upon me by “Insatiable,” I 

entered into pageant-centric 
“Queen America” expecting 
the absolute worst. After all, 
the shows resemble each other 
so much they could be cousins: 
Southern-fried teen pageantry, 
overbearing and appearance-
obsessed coaches, the promise 
to highlight messages about 
body image — the list goes on. 
Additionally working against 
my first impression of the 

show was the idea that it had 
acted 
as 
an 
opportunistic 

rip-off meant to capitalize 
on 
the 
newsworthiness 
of 

“Insatiable.” No one likes a 
copycat.

Very early on, the show 

distinguishes 
itself 
from 

“Insatiable” 
by 
putting 
its 

central focus on the coach 
Vicki Ellis (Zeta-Jones), rather 
than the individual competing 
in the pageant. Vicki Ellis is the 

best pageant coach in Tulsa — 
scratch that — all of Oklahoma, 
in the midst of creating her 
next star. Her protegée, Hayley 
Wilson 
(Victoria 
‘I 
Think 

We All Sing’ Justice, “The 
Outcasts”), is the reigning 
Miss Tulsa and a favorite to 
take home the crown of Miss 
Oklahoma. When we first meet 
Vicki barking orders as Hayley 
sprints on the treadmill, she 
appears to be nothing more 
than another two-dimensional 
character used only as a vessel 
to make overdone jokes about 
the superficiality of pageants 
or lazily embody everything 
wrong 
with 
this 
specific 

subculture. Vicki’s vitriol is 
more sloppy than sharp, and 
she seems to be judgemental 
of her anti-pageant niece Bella 
(Isabella Amara, “Spider-Man: 
Homecoming”) because she is 
overweight.

As the episode progresses 

and 
more 
information 

about Vicki’s family life and 
background is uncovered, she 
becomes a much more complex 
and purposeful character. The 
bourgeois, 
Escalade-driving 

Vicki is not all she appears 
to be; behind her façade is a 
white-trash girl who betrayed 
her roots in favor of pursuing a 
life she assumed to be superior

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘COME OUT AND 

PLAY’

INTERSCOPE RECORDS

Billie Eilish may only be 

16, but it seems like she’s 
been around forever. A year 
after her big break into 
the music industry, Eilish 
has already established a 
clear 
brand 
of 
stripped-

back, atmospheric pop that 
showcases her unique voice. 
This bare yet poignant sound 
reaches a melancholic peak 
on her recently released 
single “come out and play,” a 
song perfect for the holidays 
without any direct ties to the 
season. Listening to Eilish’s 
voice is like holding a hot 
cup of tea in front of the fire 
— it is comforting most of the 
time, but occasionally rises 
with a sharp pang of emotion, 
burning the listener with 
momentary glimpses into the 
singer’s darker thoughts. She 

is complex, but so is her art, 
offering her audience a way 
to understand the turmoil 
that seems to lay under 

Eilish’s 
languid 
exterior 

through her poetic lyrics and 
simple orchestrations.

“come out and play” clocks 

in at a typical pop single 
length of three minutes and 
30 seconds, however, the 
song could easily go on for 
several more verses without 
losing the listener. Eilish 
merges the crackling spirit 

of the holidays with a solemn 
longing to produce the kind 
of mood that is found in 
only some winter songs, like 
“River” by Joni Mitchell and 
Luther 
Vandross’s 
“Every 

Christmas.” 
While 
Eilish 

is a newcomer compared to 
legends like Mitchell and 
Vandross, she displays the 
kind of soulful sorrow of an 
artist with legitimate talent 
that will last the test of time. 
The single’s simplicity and 
earnest narrative ring true to 
this talent, surprising anyone 
who takes the time to listen 
with an outstretched hand, 
asking them to leave their 
worries behind and come out 
to dance in the snow.

to the one she was born into. 
This denial of her history cuts 
much deeper than mere class 
tension: In order to pursue 
this luxe life, she abandoned 
Bella at birth to be raised by 
her sister. It is this connection 
to Bella that serves to explain 
why Vicki has so much stake 
in, and concurrently, so much 
disappointment with the way 
that Bella has turned out under 
her sister’s care.

“Queen 
America” 
is 
not 

perfect by any means: Jokes 

fall flat, exposition can be 
clunky and the only overweight 
character is still positioned 
as the binary opposite of 
class and beauty. Its central 
character is no paragon either. 
Vicki actually believes that 
she is unerring in most of her 
stances, and that in projecting 
her own insecurities onto the 
likes of Hayley or Bella she is 
helping them. However, it is 
this intoxicating imperfection 
that makes “Queen America” 
a relative stand-out among 

the array of recently debuted 
web series — especially those 
released on Facebook Watch. 
The show does not attempt to 
delude us into believing they 
have the solutions for these 
large 
overarching 
issues. 

Rather, it plunges beneath the 
simplistic surface of pointing 
the finger at the wrongness 
of pageants in order to give 
us an in-depth look at how 
class, beauty standards and 
body image interact to create a 
horrendously damaged woman.

Way before that guy in your 

English class discovered NPR, 
audio entertainment had been 
amusing audiences for decades. 
While today it seems everyone 
and their mother has a podcast, 
the renaissance of the art form 
is a revival of the old time 
radio technology on which it is 
based. The rebranding of radio 
programs as podcasts is the best 
thing to happen to the medium 
since it was replaced by television 
back in the ’50s. Podcasts today 
have occupied every realm of 
entertainment that radio once 
had a monopoly on: There are 
dramas 
like 
“Serial,” 
news 

programs like The New York 
Times’s “The Daily” and even 
comedy shows like “WTF with 
Marc Maron” and “2 Dope 
Queens.” Podcasts have most 
certainly declared themselves 
the second golden age of radio 
and more importantly, I would 
say, the second golden age of 
radio comedy.

The Golden Age of Radio 

was a time period in American 
entertainment lasting from the 
1930s until televisions entered 
nearly 
every 
home 
in 
the 

country by the mid 1950s. Back 
in the day, families gathered 
around the radio weekly to tune 
into 
beloved 
comedy 
shows 

like “The Goldbergs” or “The 
Aldrich Family.” Like podcasts 
today, these shows survived on 
advertisements, but instead of 
ads for Blue Apron and Gillette, 
they were sponsored by Camel 
cigarettes 
and 
Pepsodent. 

Many comedies in the radio age 
were episodic and situational. 
“Abbott and Costello” used the 
medium for clever wordplay 
and endless puns to crack up 
listeners 
everywhere. 
The 

original “Funny Girl,” Fanny 
Brice, portrayed the silly young 
girl Snooks Higgins on “The 
Baby Snooks Show,” sometimes 
called “Baby Snooks and Daddy.” 
Bob Hope — usually recognized 
for hosting the Academy Awards 
a record number of 19 times 
and 
earning 
five 
honorary 

Oscars — was a massive part 
of the radio industry. For his 
64-year broadcasting run he was 
closely associated with NBC. 
He performed everywhere from 
Broadway to US military bases. 
On Hope’s show he had celebrity 
guests like Al Jolson, Jack Benny 
and Doris Day. A comedian in his 

own right, Hope’s show, “The 
Pepsodent Show Starring Bob 
Hope,” was wildly popular. The 
show boasted some 15 writers, 
including a young Sherwood 
Schwartz who would go on to 
create “Gilligan’s Island” and 
“The Brady Bunch.”

While 
much 
of 
radio 

comedy and radio in general 
was superseded by TV in the 
’50s, one very important radio 
comedy show made itself known 
in the peak of TV’s reign in 
the early 1970s. It ran weekly 
sketches and musical parodies 
from 1973 until 1974. That show 
was “The National Lampoon’s 
Radio Hour” starring the likes 
of John Belushi, Chevy Chase, 
Bill Murray, Gilda Radner and 
Harold Ramis. Like the Lampoon 
itself, the show was chock full of 
controversial and crude material, 
making it difficult to keep 
advertisers. The radio hour was 
even cut down to half an hour 
after 13 weeks. While the show 
only lasted a year, its alumni 
went on to change the history 
of comedy. Most of the alumni 
went on to work at “Saturday 
Night Live,” the show’s creator, 
Michael O’Donoghue was even 
head writer at “SNL” for its first 
three seasons.

Today, 
the 
selection 
of 

podcasts is, to put it lightly, 
overwhelming. 
Comedy 

podcasts are no exception, as 
there are hundreds of pods 
out there with the chief goal 
of making you chuckle on your 
morning commute. Earwolf — 
a podcast network part of the 
Stitcher family — is putting out 
some of the best comedic content 
thanks to the genius of comedy 
podcast king, Scott Aukerman. 
The comedy writer and improv 
master 
started 
the 
podcast 

“Comedy Bang! Bang!” under 
the name of “Comedy Death-

Ray Radio” in 2009. The show is 
an improviser’s dream as it runs 
on witty rapport and impressive 
character work. It is goofy, 
weird and sometimes downright 
bizarre, but always hilarious. 
Featuring special guests every 
week, “Comedy Bang! Bang!” 
never 
fails 
at 
keeping 
our 

attention. Some of my favorite 
recurring guests include Jason 
Mantzoukas 
(“Big 
Mouth”), 

Paul 
F. 
Tompkins 
(“Bojack 

Horseman”), 
Lauren 
Lapkus 

(“Crashing”) and Nick Kroll 
(“Big Mouth”). Aukerman and 
his business partner launched 
Earwolf 
in 
2010; 
now, 
the 

network hosts over 35 different 
comedy 
programs 
including 

Paul Scheer’s “How Did This Get 
Made?” and Jonathan Van Ness’s 
“Getting Curious.” Aukerman 
has also recently launched a 
podcast with Adam Scott of 
“Parks and Recreation” fame. 
The show in question, formerly 
known as “U Talkin’ U2 To Me?,” 
is now called “R U Talkin’ R.E.M. 
RE: ME?” The hilarious pod was 
previously devoted to delving 
into the discography of the rock 
band U2 and has now shifted its 
focus to the band R.E.M. — they 
have amazing banter that makes 
you wish you could be in the 
studio with them.

If you want to get into 

humorous podcasts but fear 
the incessant banter of improv-
based 
and 
character-focused 

pods of Aukerman fame, have a 
listen to my personal favorite, 
“My Dad Wrote a Porno.” The 
British show is hosted by James 
Cooper, Jamie Morton and Alice 
Levine. Each episode, Morton 
reads a chapter from his father’s 
self-published series of erotic 
novels, “Belinda Blinked.” Every 
moment is a cringe-fest verging 
on tears from laughter. The three 
friends tear apart the novel with 
hilarious running commentary, 
making the most uncomfortable 
moments of the highly sexual 
erotica laugh-out-loud funny. 
The pod is now on their fourth 
season, 
as 
Morton’s 
father 

continues to publish his work, for 
which we are eternally grateful. 

The art of radio comedy is 

alive and well with the plethora 
of comedy podcasts in our midst; 
the only thing left to do now is 
to get listening. And with that, 
Dear Reader, I bid you happy 
listening! 

Oh my pod! The new radio 

comedy golden age

PORTMAN

Just a little over a week 

before dropping their long-
awaited album A Brief Inquiry 
into 
Online 
Relationships, 

The 1975 released the music 
video for “Sincerity is Scary.” 
Departing from the moody, 
jazz-influenced 
pop 
sound 

of 2016’s I Like It When 
You Sleep, For You Are So 
Beautiful yet So Unaware of 
It, their sophomore effort 
ABIIOR seems destined for 
a more uplifting and radiant 
resonance 
with 
singles 

such 
as 
“Give 
Yourself 

a 
Try” 
and 
“TOOTIME 

TOOTIMETOOTIME.” 
However, “Sincerity is Scary” 
fits the bill in a different 
fashion.

Whereas 
The 
1975’s 

most recent videos veered 
more 
towards 
abstract 

visuals, “Sincerity is Scary” 
tells 
a 
story. 
Classically 

misanthropic, 
danceable 

and a bit condescending, the 
video mimics the song on an 
acoustic and aesthetic level. 

The visuals take a turn from 
the fluorescent pinks and 
blues we would expect from 
The 1975, and the first scene 
features a disheveled Matty 
Healy in a completely white 
room, the only exception 
being 
his 
navy 
forearm 

tattoo that reads “WEAK 
MESSAGES CREATE BAD 
SITUATIONS.” The camera 
then pans to a black-and-
white piece of art on the wall 

before landing on a vivid 
urban scene. From then on, 
Healy takes to singing in the 
streets and adapting to the 
various dance scenes and 
street illusions he encounters 
throughout 
his 
leisurely 

stroll.

While 
seemingly 
unfit 

for a song about a difficult 
relationship, 
the 
music 

video suits the narrative in 
its capacity to foster a fun, 
upbeat energy in the face of 
the various difficulties Healy 
faces throughout it. Though 
characteristically 
pedantic 

and corny in its delivery 
and aims, it showcases The 
1975’s undeniable strength 
in generating an appeal and 
sound that is genuine and all 
their own.

Self-help goes beyond the 
self in Havrilesky’s essays

I love the genre of self-help. I 

love its relentless optimism, its 
fundamental belief in our ability 
to cultivate positive change 
and the way it encourages 
us to see ourselves as active 
participants in our lives rather 
than as victims. In an age of 
overwhelming anxiety, I love 
being told that the problems 
of the world are simple and 
individual, and that if only I 
were to meditate / journal / pray 
more, I would be able to insulate 
myself against universal human 
emotions 
like 
fear, 
anger, 

insecurity and loss.

But I don’t entirely trust 

self-help, 
for 
exactly 
these 

reasons: its oversimplification, 
its insistence that we exorcize 
our 
uncomfortable 
emotions 

and the way it puts the onus for 
change on the individual rather 
than on the society. The “self” 
in self-help is important, even 
essential, but in a world where 
we are hyper-connected — our 
circumstances largely dictated 
by power structures beyond 
our control — it can’t be the 
whole story. Don’t we have a 
responsibility at some point to 
stop navel-gazing and help the 
world around us too?

Heather Havrilesky’s latest 

collection 
of 
essays, 
“What 

If This Were Enough?” does 
exactly 
that, 
directing 
the 

introspective and philosophical 
tools 
of 
self-help 
not 
only 

at the individual, but at the 
society at large. Havrilesky’s 
project is simple in theory, 
but fascinatingly nuanced in 
practice: to diagnose our shared 
cultural 
values, 
anxieties, 

obsessions and illusions in order 
to better understand the way 
they influence our individual 
emotional landscapes.

The essays in this collection 

are richly layered, emotionally 
evocative and often profoundly 
funny. Havrilesky focuses mostly 
on popular culture as a medium 
for our shared preoccupations, 
and moves nimbly between 
analytical investigations of what 
our cultural artifacts tell us 
about our priorities and deeply 
personal reckonings with how 
those priorities infiltrate our 
psyches.

In “The Smile Factory,” she 

explores how the phenomenons 
of Disney and Buzzfeed have 
created a culture of obligatory 
cheerfulness 
and 
constant 

distraction. In “The Land of 
Heroic Villains,” she connects 
our narrative fascination with 
antiheroes to the elevation of 
figures like Harvey Weinstein 
and Donald Trump. In “The 
Popularity 
Contest,” 
she 

analyzes how the numbers game 
of social media has warped the 
way we evaluate our own worth. 
Other essays, like “Adults Only” 
and “Playing House,” take a 
more personal turn, recounting 
Havrilesky’s own experiences 
with hard-earned wisdom and 
haunting vulnerability.

Pulling together all these 

loose threads is Havrilesky’s 
overarching 
emphasis 
on 

mindfulness and gratitude — 
not in the shallow, gimmicky 
ways these terms often get 
thrown around in the rhetoric 
of self-care, but as the only 
logical remedies for a sick 
culture. 
She 
encourages 
us 

to be more cognizant of the 
ways we’ve internalized our 
society’s poisonous values and 
assumptions, 
and 
crusades 

against distraction, asking us 
to look closely at our difficult 
experiences 
and 
emotions 

rather 
than 
pathologically 

turning 
away 
from 
them. 

Havrilesky’s 
insistence 
that 

we face this darker side of our 
humanity might come across 
as depressing if it wasn’t such 
a refreshing change from the 
enforced perfection we so often 
experience, and if it wasn’t 
balanced with an unrelenting 
compassion 
for 
our 
shared 

humanity.

Again and again, she comes 

to the conclusion that the 
only way for us to live full, 

meaningful lives is to do what 
we can with what we have, 
to live for the present and to 
“embrace the conflicted nature 
of humankind.” Ultimately, she 
writes, “We have to rediscover 
how to navigate each day. We 
have to learn how to embrace 
the imperfection of the present 
moment and accept the wide 
range of experiences that fall 
between happiness and sadness, 
success and failure, true love 
and 
hatred, 
popularity 
and 

invisibility.” 
Only 
when 
we 

release our belief in perfection 
and get comfortable with that 
uncomfortable 
middle-ground 

will we be able to see that 
what we have right now, in this 
moment, is enough.

T

he No. 7 Michigan men’s 
basketball team enters 
Wednesday’s top-15 
showdown 
with North 
Carolina 
ranked just 
four spots 
ahead of 
the Tar 
Heels.
How they 
got there 
couldn’t be 
more dif-
ferent.
North Carolina’s high-pow-
ered offense is averaging 96.6 
points per game in its 6-1 start. 
The Wolverines, meanwhile, 
have ascended to their highest 
regular-season ranking in six 
years on the back of a defense 
that allows just 48.8 points per 
game.
One — or more likely, both 
— of those numbers is going to 
change Wednesday evening. 
The question for Michigan 
is where that balance will be 
struck.
Because if its defense can 
stop the Tar Heels, it can stop 
anyone.
North Carolina’s offense 
isn’t the best in the country — it 
currently ranks fourth in Ken-
Pom adjusted offensive effi-
ciency, behind Nevada, Duke 
and Gonzaga. But as far as the 
Wolverines are concerned, it 
may as well be. The difference 
between the Tar Heels and the 
three teams ahead of them is 
negligible and, more impor-
tantly, they may be the team 
best built to overcome Michi-
gan’s stifling defense.
As Villanova learned two 
weeks ago, the Wolverines’ 
defense makes it extremely dif-
ficult to score once an opposing 
offense settles into the half 
court. It chases shooters off 
the perimeter, and uses quick 
hands to stop guards from pen-
etrating into the lane.
What Michigan hasn’t faced 
— since its 86-71 loss in Chapel 
Hill a year ago — is an offense 
that can run like North Caro-
lina’s. Transition offense has 
always been a staple of Roy 

Williams’ offenses, but this 
team is unique. Of Williams’ 
five teams that have ranked in 
the top-10 in adjusted tempo, 
two won the national champi-
onship. This year’s version of 
the Tar Heels is 11th through 
seven games. The Wolverines 
have yet to face a team in the 
top 200.
“When they’re running, they 
are running downhill,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
on Tuesday. “It’s like a freight 
train coming at you.”
Last year, against a less 
talented North Carolina 
team, the Wolverines couldn’t 
handle that tempo. But, as 
sophomore forward Isaiah Liv-
ers notes, that was just their 
eighth game under assistant 
coach and defensive specialist 
Luke Yaklich. Since that loss 
last November, Michigan has 
allowed more than 72 points 
just twice — against Purdue 
and Villanova, the nation’s two 
best teams by adjusted offen-
sive efficiency.
“We were experimenting 
with a new defense,” Livers 
said of last year’s game. “And 
now, I feel like our defense is 
experienced enough and (has) 
more veterans to understand 
our roles.”
As good as last year’s defense 
was, Wednesday is the Wol-
verines’ opportunity to prove 
that this group is deserving of 
its billing as the nation’s best. 
It hasn’t allowed more than 61 
points in a game and held Vil-
lanova — at Villanova — to its 
lowest point total in six years.
But the Wildcats are still 
finding themselves after losing 
their top three scorers from 
last season. The Tar Heels, at 
least offensively, know who 
they are — and it works.
Point guard Coby White 
looks like a star, averaging 
26 points and 5.5 assists last 
weekend at the Las Vegas Invi-
tational. Guard Cameron John-
son is shooting 48.5 percent 
from three. Forward Nassir 
Little, who played with Michi-
gan freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis in a high school 
showcase, is projected to be a 

top-five NBA draft pick.
“He’s just one of those play-
ers that can do it all,” Braz-
deikis said. “It’s just gonna be 
exciting to matchup with a guy 
like that.”
That’s before you get to 
forward Luke Maye, who was 
a Wooden Award finalist last 
year and is one of the early 
favorites to win it this year. 
Maye presents a unique prob-
lem for Michigan because of 
his ability to play as a stretch 
‘5,’ countering the Wolverines’ 
small-ball lineup that features 
Livers at the ‘5.’
If there’s a trick to beating 
the Wolverines’ defense — 
whether that be speed, talent 
or style — North Carolina has 

it. Michigan could give up 90 
points on Wednesday and still 
have a very good defense. But 
if the Wolverines are able to 
extend their streak of holding 
opponents under 62 against the 
Tar Heels, they’ll prove that 
they can stop anybody.
Just ask Beilein.
“Don’t hand national cham-
pionships to anybody until 
you see this team tomorrow,” 
Beilein said, referring to North 
Carolina.
Then he paused.
“These two teams tomor-
row.”

Wolverines to take on Navy in Tournament

With Thanksgiving now in 
the rearview mirror, the end of 
November means one thing for 
Division I women’s volleyball: 
the Big Dance is upon us.
This Friday, the No. 18 
Michigan women’s volleyball 
team (22-9 overall, 11-9 Big 
Ten) will travel to Pittsburgh 
to take on unseeded Navy (23-8 
overall, 13-3 Patriot League) 
in the opening round of the 
NCAA Tournament.
Friday’s clash features two 
programs that took drastically 
different paths to the Steel 
City. 
Though 
Michigan 
finished seventh in the Big 
Ten 
standings, 
its 
fourth 
consecutive 
20-win 
season 
proved strong enough to earn 
an at-large bid. The Big Ten has 
seven teams in the field — more 
than any other conference in 
the nation.
Despite being seeded outside 
of the top-16, the Wolverines 
still enter the Tournament 
as one of the most polished 
teams in the field of 64. With 
2017 
All-American 
Carly 
Skjodt leading the charge on 
offense and senior libero Jenna 
Lerg anchoring the defense, 
opponents have struggled to 
find a weak link in Michigan’s 
starting lineup.
After beginning the season 
unranked, 
the 
Wolverines 
clawed their way up to as high 
as No. 12 in the AVCA Coaches 
Poll before closing out the 
regular season ranked 18th in 
the poll and 21st in RPI.
The team lost redshirt junior 
middle blocker Cori Crocker 
to an ankle sprain and junior 
opposite Sydney Wetterstrom 
to an undisclosed injury for 
the entirety of October, but 
both starters made their way 
back into the fold during 
November. Their absences gave 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen 
a chance to develop young 
talent under authentic match 

conditions, which could be a 
key component of the team’s 
potential tournament run.
On the other hand, Navy will 
be making its first tournament 
appearance in program history 
after 
securing 
the 
Patriot 
League’s autobid. The Mids 
guaranteed themselves a spot in 
the Big Dance by upending top-
seeded American University in 
the conference championship 
game behind a match-high 25 
kills from sophomore outside 
hitter Maddi Sgattoni.
Under the guidance of first-
year head coach Paco Labrador, 
Navy has relied on Sgattoni 
to spearhead its offense all 
year long — she has recorded 
1,252 attack attempts, while 
none of her teammates have 
even eclipsed 725. Though she 
has regularly posted high kill 
tallies, quantity hasn’t yielded 
quality 
for 
Sgattoni, 
who 
finished the regular season 

with 
an 
inefficient 
attack 
percentage of just .181.
In order to compare the 
Wolverines and the Mids on 
the same scale, take a look 
at each team’s result against 
Rutgers, one of their common 
opponents during the regular 
season. The Scarlet Knights 
are 1-99 — yes, you read that 
correctly — against Big Ten 
opponents since joining the 
conference in 2014, with their 
lone triumph coming against 
Maryland in 2015. 
Rutgers defeated Navy in 
four sets on Sept. 8, outscoring 
the Mids by 17 in the process. 
Meanwhile, 
Michigan 
trounced Rutgers to the tune of 
a 3-0 sweep on Sept. 28, while 
holding the Scarlet Knights to 
under 15 points in two of the 
three sets. The discrepancy in 
each team’s outcome against 
the same opponent in a 20-day 
span shows a wide gap in talent 

between the rosters.
Navy 
comes 
into 
the 
tournament slotted at 90th in 
national RPI, 69 spots behind 
the 
Wolverines. 
The 
Mids 
are the Patriot League’s only 
team ranked in the top 100 
of the RPI rankings, while 16 
of Michigan’s regular season 
opponents — 13 of which 
compete in the Big Ten — 
finished in the top 100.
The 
big 
takeaway? 
The 
Wolverines, who have made 
the tournament in 17 of Rosen’s 
20 seasons at the helm of 
the program, are far more 
prepared for the tournament’s 
level of competition and its 
accompanying pressure than 
their rookie opponent.
When push comes to shove, 
Michigan’s first round fate will 
lie in its ability to keep Sgattoni 
in check while simultaneously 
varying 
its 
own 
offensive 
attack.

Michigan coach Mark Rosen is preparing the Wolverines to play against Navy in the NCAA Tournament on Friday.

Johnson adds depth, 
leadership to lineup

Three days after Hailey 
Brown went down with a leg 
injury last February, then-
sophomore 
guard 
Akienreh 
Johnson scored a career-high 
19 points against Minnesota.
From that point on, Johnson 
— “AK” as she’s known by her 
teammates — was a staple 
of 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball lineup. She went 
from seeing barely any minutes 
off the bench to excelling as 
the Wolverines’ sixth-woman 
— scoring in double figures in 
three of the last six games of 
the season.
“AK 
had 
an 
outstanding 
finish 
to 
last 
season,” 
said 
Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico. “She really 
came on strong 
late. She helped 
in the Big Ten 
Tournament and 
helped us in the 
NCAA Tournament. So I think 
she brings a level of experience 
playing in big games.”
That stretch did wonders 
for Johnson’s confidence. Her 
ascent to the starting lineup — 
or at the very least, significant 
minutes 
off 
the 
bench 
— 
looked within reach heading 
into 
her 
junior 
campaign. 
Unfortunately for Johnson and 
the Michigan team as a whole, 
she suffered a broken hand 
right before the season got in 
the way of that. She missed the 
first three games of the regular 
season and only returned to 
practice a few days before her 
season debut against Missouri 
in the Gulf Coast Showcase.
“I was a little nervous 
because 
I 
had 
only 
had 
like 
a practice and 
a 
half 
before 
getting into the 
game,” Johnson 
said. “So I was 
a little nervous 
to get my feet 
wet. But I think 
coming 
back 
was good for me 
mentally, 
too, 
because I came 
back against such competitive 
teams that I’ll be ready for the 
rest of the season.”
Over the course of the Gulf 
Coast 
Showcase, 
Johnson 
averaged 
14 
minutes 
per 
game against the likes of the 
21st-ranked Tigers, No. 5 Texas 
and Washington — a figure 
that will likely increase as the 
season goes on.
The benefits of her return are 
two-fold for the Wolverines.
On the court, Johnson’s size 
at the guard position makes 
her a tough matchup for a lot 
of players. She has shown an 
ability to both shoot from the 
outside and drive the basketball 
with success, but her real 
contribution takes shape in her 
rebounding ability.
“I’m more of a taller guard,” 
she said. “A lot of guards are 
smaller than me so they don’t 

expect the wings to be able to 
rebound. So I think I’m more 
of 
a 
rebounding, 
stronger, 
physical guard that can get to 
the basket but also shoot the 
wide-open jump shot.”
Now a junior, her feel and 
game experience also suits 
a relatively young Michigan 
squad.
“She’s 
been 
through 
practices,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I think the game is starting 
to slow down for her. She 
has a good feel for the game. 
She knows how to cut, she 
knows how to read, she’s 
really a student of the game. 
I think she’s really going to 
provide a lot 
of experience 
at the guard 
spot.”
The 
second, 
and 
arguably more 
important, 
aspect of her 
return is her 
development 
as 
a 
team 
leader.
Following her stellar end to 
last season, Barnes Arico and 
the other coaches encouraged 
Johnson to be more outspoken. 
Sidelined with her hand injury, 
she finally embraced a more 
vocal role in practice and 
during games.
“Off the court, I do a lot like 
take the freshmen places,” 
she said. “If they need a ride, 
I’ll do that to try and build a 
relationship off the court, so 
that on the court, I can be more 
trustworthy to people and I 
can have a better relationship 
with them.”
Johnson’s 
experience 
at 
Michigan thus far is one that 
resonates with her younger 
teammates. 
Her 
basketball 
career 
has 
been 
riddled 
with adversity. 
Two 
ACL 
injuries 
over 
the course of 
three 
years, 
having to bide 
her time on the 
bench 
until 
her 
number 
was called at 
the end of her 
sophomore 
season 
and 
then 
getting 
injured again shortly after is 
a sequence of events not easily 
overcome.
And yet, Johnson has battled 
through it all.
“She is a kid that didn’t play 
much in her younger days,” 
Barnes Arico said. “For the 
younger kids to see that and to 
see her growth and now where 
she is, I think they believe 
‘Hey, that could be me. I need 
to buy in and I need to keep 
working.’
“AK is soft-spoken, but she 
connects with everyone, and 
I think she’s helped the rest 
of the players in our program 
really believe in that vision.”
Johnson may not be a starter, 
but 
her 
continued 
growth 
as both a player and a leader 
could be a major asset for the 
Wolverines going forward.

The first overtime period 
of the season didn’t amount to 
much for the No. 14 Michigan 
hockey team.
Against Penn State on Nov. 
16, the extra period lasted 
approximately 
six 
seconds 
when Nittany Lion forward 
Sam Sternschein scored the 
overtime goal.
So 
the 
first 
real 
taste 
of overtime came in this 
weekend’s 
series 
against 
Wisconsin, 
with 
both 
a 
double-overtime win and a 
shootout loss.
And Hayden Lavigne stayed 
front and center.
The 
junior 
goaltender 
played a major factor during 
regulation 
in 
both 
games, 
allowing only one goal in 18 
attempts Friday and two in 37 
attempts Saturday. It was in 
the overtime periods that he 
shined the most, however.
Lavigne has struggled to 
maintain his spot in the net. 
After coming into the season as 
the unquestioned starter, his 
shaky performances pushed 
freshman Strauss Mann in the 
rotation to add competition. 
Against Penn State, though, 
Mann received starting nods 
to start the entire weekend, 
rather 
than 
splitting 
with 
Lavigne — a rotation Michigan 
has maintained throughout 
the season.
So this weekend’s extra 
periods were, in a sense, 
redemption.
“Hayden 
Lavigne, 
excellent,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson. 
“He’s 
the reason we got the point 
tonight. Good for him. That’s 
the Hayden that we’ve come 
to expect and know, so a really 
good weekend for him.”
It didn’t come easy. Friday, 
Lavigne fended off two Badger 
pushes in overtime before 
forcing 
a 
double-overtime 
period 
that 
ended 
briefly. 

But after Quinn Hughes, Will 
Lockwood and Josh Norris 
took control of the puck, little 
needed to be done goaltending-
wise. The Wolverines had 
scored in their first offensive 
possession.
And it came to Lavigne’s 
relief. The fast-paced nature of 
three-on-three hockey makes 
Lavigne “really anxious,” and 
the team doesn’t practice any 
three-on-three.
That was until Saturday, 
when Michigan found itself 
in another double-overtime 
period. Except this time, it 
was in a worse situation. The 
Wolverines had committed a 
penalty right before the initial 
overtime period ended, which 
carried into the next period.
So rather than playing an 
already 
troublesome 
three-
on-three hockey, Lavigne had 
to battle against Wisconsin’s 
man-advantage.
“I just kind of knew that 
there was going to be a guy 
open at all times, and look for a 
one-timer like how they scored 

their first power play goal on,” 
Lavigne said. “Sure enough, 
we did a good job of getting in 
lanes. So there wasn’t an initial 
shot option for most of the 
guys, and I just tried to try to 
stay calm and make sure I was 
making reads and knowing 
where everybody was.”
Added Pearson: “They made 
a couple nice plays, had guys 
all alone, and Hayden made 
key saves. He battled tonight. 
He competed tonight. He was 
sharp, he was sharp. You could 
tell he was on it and he made it 
look pretty easy.”
Staying calm was a strategy 
that 
proved 
successful 
in 
double overtime for Lavigne. 
So when play extended to a 
shootout, he did it again.
“I try to stay calm,” Lavigne 
said. “The biggest thing is 
outwaiting the shooter.”
In the first shootout attempt, 
the patience paid off. Choosing 
to put pressure on the shooter, 
Lavigne positioned himself out 
far to block off the shot lanes. 
He inched back to the goal, 

facing the shooter as he slid 
back into the net.
Wisconsin 
defenseman 
Wyatt Kalynuk couldn’t find 
any openings and tried a 
backhand flick as the ice in 
front of him wound down. It 
was a save to extend the game 
at least one more play.
The 
second 
attempt, 
however, 
showed 
a 
brief 
moment 
when 
Lavigne’s 
patience didn’t benefit him.
“I did well on the first 
one, the second one I might 
have waited a little bit too 
long, he kinda beat me on 
that,” Lavigne said. It’s kinda 
patience pretty much, just wait 
for him to make a move and 
wait for that instead of trying 
to make a move first.”
The skater took his time, 
curling in an “S”-shaped route 
before centering himself in 
front of Lavigne. Not wanting 
to bite too quickly on a 
potential fake, Lavigne stayed 
up and wasn’t able to react to 
the five-hole shot that ended 
the game.

Notebook: Pastujov 
sees offensive uptick

Last season, junior forward 
Nick Pastujov recorded just four 
goals and 11 assists in 36 games. 
This season, he has seven goals 
and four assists through 13 
games — nearly doubling his 
scoring production just a third 
of the way through the season.
The New York Islanders’ 
draft pick saw an increase in 
offensive production from his 
freshman season — where he 
scored one goal and added 
two assists in 28 games — to 
his sophomore campaign. The 
trend has quietly continued 
into his third year with the 
Michigan hockey team.
Being a point producer has 
never been Pastujov’s calling 
card, but he thrives when 
embracing physicality, creating 
havoc in the offensive zone and 
winning faceoff battles. This 
season, he is second on the 
team in faceoff-win percentage 
at .571, an increase from last 
season’s .452-win percentage in 
the circle.
The jump in production has 
not gone unnoticed by Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson.
“He’s so much better than 
he was offensively,” Pearson 
said. “I think he’s hitting the 
net more, more confidence. 
He was playing with a couple 
freshmen last year and they’re 
sophomores now — they’re both 
having better years than they 
did last year, too. So, I think it’s 
a combination.”
After practice on Tuesday, 
Pearson also noted that this past 
summer was Pastujov’s most 
impressive as far as training.
“(I) worked on little things 
like 
winning 
battles 
and 
winning 
stick 
battles, 
winning corner 
battles, 
getting 
stronger,” 
Pastujov 
said. 
“Just 
getting 
stronger, faster 
and a little bit 
smarter.
“We’re 
on 
the power play 
now, too, and gotten some goals 
there, so we’re getting a lot 
more ice time. Getting to create 
more chances, getting out there 
more and being able to get in a 
groove as the game goes on. And 
I think that’s played a big role in 
that uptick in production.”
One area of play that has 
been an issue for Pastujov this 
season, though, has been his 
plus-minus. He currently sits at 
minus-four, which would be the 
lowest of his collegiate career.
“It’s something where we’ve 
been in the room a lot watching 
video, focusing really heavily 
on turning that minus into a 
plus,” Pastujov said. “Hopefully 
before Christmas but definitely 
very, very quickly. That has to 
be the biggest thing to work on, 
just keeping that production up.
“Just gotta score, or get 
scored on.”

Goaltender 
competition 
continues

For 
two 
consecutive 
weekends 
now, 
Pearson 
has opted to start the same 
goaltender 
on 
back-to-back 

nights, after previously rotating 
starters 
for 
each 
game. 
Freshman Strauss Mann got 
the nod in net for both games 
against 
Penn 
State, 
while 
junior Hayden Lavigne started 
this 
past 
weekend 
against 
Wisconsin.
Michigan came out of both 
weekends with three points 
and 
all 
four 
games 
were 
competitive to the final buzzer. 
The difference? Mann allowed 
11 goals to a high-powered 
Nittany Lions offense while 
Lavigne surrendered just three 
to Wisconsin.
“It just depends on how they 
play,” Pearson said. “If Hayden 
gets the opportunity to play 
Friday and plays like he did 
this past weekend and strings 
games together then I think 
he’s making a strong case to 
be ‘the guy.’ And Strauss, it’s 
a little bit of work in progress. 
He’s very capable, I’ve got a 
lot of confidence in him, as the 
team does. But he did give up 11 
goals — whatever way you slice 
it — against Penn State, and he 
played well.
“But Hayden comes in and 
gives up three goals. Now 
different teams — you look at 
where they are in the offensive 
stats in the country and you take 
that into consideration, too, but 
no timeline at this point.”

Luke Morgan and Adam 
Winborg record first goals of 
season

There were times during 
practice coming into this season 
where 
redshirt 
sophomore 
forward Luke Morgan looked 
like the best player on the ice, 
according 
to 
Pearson. 
And 
on Saturday — 
his 13th game 
of 
the 
season 
— 
he 
tallied 
his 
first 
goal 
in a Michigan 
sweater.
“It felt good, 
definitely,” 
Morgan 
said. 
“It’s a big relief, 
it 
took 
a 
lot 
longer than I’d 
like it to, but 
it’s definitely a big relief going 
forward knowing I don’t have to 
worry about it.”
Junior 
forward 
Adam 
Winborg 
joined 
Morgan 
in 
recording his first goal of the 
campaign over the weekend. 
The 
Stockholm 
native 
saw 
plenty of ice time in his first 
two seasons, playing in 30 and 
39 games, respectively. Thus 
far, he has played in seven of 
thirteen regular season games, 
but has been a mainstay in the 
lineup since the Lake Superior 
State weekend series.

Cam 
York 
announces 
commitment to Michigan

Cam York, a defenseman 
for the U.S. National Team 
Development 
Program, 
announced his commitment to 
Michigan on Tuesday. He has 
recorded 16 points through 21 
games this season. York — a 
five-star prospect and likely 
an eventual NHL-first rounder 
— decommitted from Boston 
College in September and joins 
fellow USNTDP forward John 
Beecher as a Wolverine commit.

“I didn’t realize academia 
was a career for me”


S

ometimes I dim my computer screen 
and meander down the streets of my 
hometown via the panoramic lens of 
Google Street View. This is a pathetic confes-
sion, I know, but also an unexpected remedy 
for the occasional pangs of nostalgia.
In my head, I relate these virtual escapes 
to the same sort of self-reflection preached 
by Henry David Thoreau and his transcen-
dentalist clique. I’ll pause for a second and 
admit that this analogy would have undoubt-
edly yielded a sarcastic red pen comment 
from my high school literature teacher, but I 
couldn’t resist the opportunity.
Anyhow, I bring this guilty pleasure of 
mine up not to embarrass myself, but rather 
to provide the context for how I found my 
2007 Subaru Forester parked in front of my 
high school on Google Street View. That is 
right, my car has preserved a high school 
legacy that beats any state championship 
trophy or school newspaper byline.
I am rather proud of this accomplish-
ment. Not just because securing this park-
ing space likely required pressing the 
snooze button only once and successfully 
parallel parking. But also, because my car 
is scrapbooked into the town’s internet 
identity — an achievement much more 
impressive than any yearbook superlative.
Before I go any further, I should clarify 
that while I will refer to the car as “mine” for 
simplicity’s sake, it is not. It is my parents’. I 
didn’t sign the check at the used car dealer-
ship. It was my dad who spent hours perusing 
Craigslist and chatting with car salesmen. 
And it was my mom who researched “safest 
cars for teenage drivers.” This is how it was 
decided I would drive a Subaru.
Subaru. The car breed synonymous with 
Vermonters who I would imagine spend 
Saturday mornings loading their mountain 
bike into the trunk along with a packed 
lunch of Clif bars and Soylent. Subaru driv-
ers wear flannel, don handlebar mustaches 
and will likely be the first ones to slap on 
a Bernie 2020 bumper sticker. In other 
words, my L.L. Bean cable knit sweater 
probably isn’t enough to earn the distinc-
tion of an archetype Subaru driver.
Yet, the transaction that resulted in me 
driving a Subaru eerily resembles the sig-
nature “precious little girl” trope beloved by 

the Subaru marketing team. This probably 
also explains why my parents affixed a “Cau-
tion New Driver” bumper sticker to the rear 
window. I think that is all the evidence you 
need to confirm I was the oldest child.
My car is named Silvia. I am not sure 
what prompted my 16-year-old self to 
select that name. Most obviously, the nick-
name aptly matches her grey exterior and 
silver spray-painted rims –– the handi-
work of her previous owner.
Assigning a name to your first car was a 
routine practice among my high school peers. 
Silvia’s friends included a sedan named Ruby 
and a Jeep named Conrad. I think the tradi-
tion humanized the metal frames of our lit-
eral high school ride or dies.
Silvia’s upholstered seats reeked of chlo-
rine from all the swim team carpools where 
we opted to not change out of our swimsuits. 
Her glove compartment housed a collec-
tion of guilty pleasure CDs that would likely 
cause embarrassment if my Spotify account 
now showed them as recently played. Besides 
the sticky residue of unidentifiable liquids 
from can drive fundraisers, the trunk stored 
a snow scraper that was tossed between my 
sister and me after removing the inches of 
overnight snow accumulation.
As I would often explain to my mother 

when justifying Silvia’s unkempt nature, the 
cleanliness of the car often correlated with 
the stress I was experiencing that particular 
week. The ACT was looming that coming 
Saturday? Please excuse the loose practice 
tests strewn across the backseat. Oh, the AP 
Spanish midterm was tomorrow? Look for 
the dozens of subjunctive verb flashcards 
crammed into the center console. It was peak 
swim season with 14-hour days? I am sorry, 
Dad, for the six water bottles that never 
seemed to return to the dishwasher.
I admit that the first time I shifted Sil-
via’s gear into drive I felt like I had finally 
earned the classification of a true Ameri-
can teenager. The mobility allowed by 
the automobile had propelled generations 
of teenagers to engage in the most lauded 
pop culture shenanigans. I felt empowered 
by the possibility of cutting class like Fer-
ris Bueller, dancing with the T-Birds to 
Greased Lightning or speeding down main 
street like in “Herbie: Fully Loaded.” 
For a moment, a limitlessness to my exis-
tence was introduced. An existence beyond 
hometown borders or parent drop-offs. 
However, in reality, Silvia’s rebellious pos-
sibility was quelled by my own conserva-
tive personality. That is, I can count on my 
fingers the number of times she reached 60 

mph while I was driving. In fact, her driv-
ing record while I manned the wheel prob-
ably more closely resembled a car parked in a 
Florida condominium.
Silvia rarely traveled more than a few 
miles at a time. This is evidenced by the rare 
occasions that the heater would actually 
warm up before reaching the destination. 
Most subzero mornings were spent driving 
with mittens and relying on the liquid heat of 
Earl Grey tea to warm my body.
So, unlike what the ’80s movie canon 
had led me to believe, my car did not deliver 
many crazy adolescent escapades. It did not 
cruise rural Michigan till godless hours of 
the night. She never went to a drive-in movie 
with a boy. Nor was the hiding place for illicit 
substances. I guess sometimes I swore in the 
car, but that doesn’t necessarily qualify as 
material for the next teenage flick.
I occasionally dwell on the rather pla-
tonic highlight reel of my high school 
years. But then, I remember perhaps the 
most valuable tenet of Silvia’s companion-
ship was beyond the coming of age narra-
tive we liken to teenage car ownership.
Silvia listened to me rehearse Spanish 
oral conversaciones. She patiently endured 
the endless duets of “Wicked” with a best 
friend whose friendship later crackled 
amidst the changing leaves of our first 
college semester. She guarded the confes-
sions that were divulged during gossip ses-
sions about school dances. I opened college 
acceptance emails in Silvia. I slammed her 
door when group projects failed miserably. 
And she comforted me when the lingering 
goals of high school slipped away from the 
window of attainability.
Our first cars see us at our most raw 
moments of adolescence. They are our 
most intimate confidants throughout high 
school. For those of us without cars in col-
lege, the discretion that a high school car 
was able to provide is no longer guaranteed. 
Emotion is harder to conceal with the per-
petual company of 28,000 undergraduates. 
I think that is why I take comfort in the abil-
ity to plug in an address and see sweet little 
Silvia right where I remember her the most. 
Just waiting for a hometown visit and the 
chance to plug in the aux cord for the best 
type of high school reunion.

O

ne afternoon in late May 2017, 
my family and I pulled our 
Ford Escape into the drive-
way — we’d just gotten back from a 
short Memorial Day weekend trip — to 
find a small, red chicken coop sitting 
on our lawn.
I dashed over and lifted up the roof 
of the coop, exposing two anxiously 
clucking, rust-colored hens cowering 
in the sawdust-covered nesting box. 
The birds were afraid to let me touch 
them, but I released them from their 
pen and spent the rest of the after-
noon watching them explore our small 
backyard, scratching at fallen leaves 
and nibbling on crabgrass. My parents, 
brother and I named the smaller, more 
nervous hen Egglantine, after a char-
acter in the “Guardians of Ga’hoole,” 
and the more robust one Yolklanda, a 
cringe-worthy egg pun.
The hens were a surprise for my 19th 
birthday, a gift for which I’d begged my 
parents after hearing of other chicken 
owners in greater Boston. The idea of 
raising farm animals in a suburban 
area was appealing, and quite honest-
ly, the chickens served as a welcome 
distraction. I’d just returned home 
from an exhausting first year at the 
University of Michigan. It had been a 
long, lonely two semesters — I’d found 

it nearly impossible to branch out and 
make friends, and had struggled with 
anxiety and low self-esteem. That 
spring, I’d come home feeling depleted, 
unclear on who I was or what I wanted.
Pouring my energy into the chickens 
helped me to feel grounded in a way I 
hadn’t during my first year of school. I 
turned the chickens into my personal 
project, building new additions to their 
pen, ordering bulk quantities of feed 
and treats off the internet, noticing 
and researching every new sound or 
behavior. Driven to own the happiest 
suburban chickens ever, I’d rush home 
from work each afternoon to release 
the hens for their free-range time. I 
worried constantly about the chickens’ 
well-being and picked up the slight-
est signs of discomfort. On hot days, 
Egglantine and Yolklanda were pam-
pered with frozen treats and ice-cold 
water, changed every few hours.
Not only did the chickens give me 
purpose, but I found them incredibly 
calming. Each morning before work, I’d 
collect their eggs, change their water, 
clean the cage and then sit on my porch 
with a cup of tea and a crossword puz-
zle, watching the hens scratch around 
the yard. I loved the routine, and the 
chickens looked so focused and peace-
ful foraging for their breakfast that it 

was hard to not feel relaxed.
As I settled in to the summer and 
slowly processed my freshman year, 
the chickens transitioned in their own 
way. Yolklanda quickly became com-
fortable with her new home and own-
ers, but Egglantine adjusted a bit more 
gradually. For the first few weeks after 
her move, she refused to lay eggs — a 
sign of stress — and was skittish around 
people. Eventually, Egglantine began 

laying, and by the end of the summer 
she was confident enough to run up to 
me and accept treats from my hand.
It wasn’t easy for me to part with my 
chickens that August, because they’d 
come to represent the comfort and 
routine of home. For the first semes-
ter of sophomore year, each time I 

called home, I’d ask for details about 
Egglantine and Yolklanda — did they 
seem healthy? Had they done anything 
funny or cute?
I pushed myself to find my place at 
the University that fall, joining student 
organizations and connecting with 
new people in my classes and clubs. 
Even as my schedule filled up and I 
slowly started to recognize more faces 
on campus, the chickens remained an 
important piece of my identity. They 
were my go-to fun fact, a dependable 
conversation starter. Owning chickens 
didn’t help me make friends, but did 
make it easier to introduce myself and 
give others a glimpse of my personality.
By second semester sophomore year, 
I was finally feeling adjusted. I’d devel-
oped close friendships with my room-
mates and a few classmates, forming a 
small but closely-knit social network. I 
still had moments of anxiety and lone-
liness, but I was paying much more 
attention to my mental health, and 
overall felt more centered and confi-
dent.
I thought of the chickens occasion-
ally, asking my family for updates and 
stories, but as the University became 
home, they gradually faded into the 
periphery of my mind. I was busy, 
immersed in my friends, clubs and 
classes, fully present. No longer was 
the fact that I raised chickens my 
default “about me” — I had new ways 
to connect with people, friends in com-
mon, shared clubs and extracurricular 
interests. My social circle expanded 
more over the summer, as I stayed in 
Ann Arbor for an internship at a local 
tech company.
One morning in August, I was 
running along Washtenaw Avenue, 
engrossed in my thoughts about the 
day ahead. I was happy, looking for-
ward to an afternwoon swim in 
the Huron River followed by a 
game night with friends. When 
my brother called and told me 
he had bad news, I wasn’t sur-
prised by the words that came 
next: Egglantine, sickly as ever, 
had died. Her sister was headed 
back to the farm where she’d 
been born, because hens don’t 
like living alone.
The news hurt to hear, but I 
didn’t feel sad, only reflective. I 
kept running, lost in the rhythm 
of my steps on the pavement, contem-
plating my one year and three months 
as a chicken owner. The hens had given 
me structure when I felt untethered, 
a sense of self when I needed one. For 
one-pound birds, Egglantine and Yolk-
landa had carried a lot of weight.

I 

remember it vividly. It was summer 
of 2015 and I was receiving emails 
from the University of Michigan 
about something called the “Undergradu-
ate Research Opportunity.” I had no idea 
what this meant, nor did I take the time 
to care. I was excited to be attending the 
University in just a few months, but was 
not one to open seemingly-superfluous 
emails. It was probably spam or a solicita-
tion for funding, but certainly not some-
thing that required attention from me 
— an incoming freshman with absolutely 
no idea what was going on.
Fast forward to the winter semester 
of my sophomore year, I took a class on 
sociological research methods and fell 
in love. I ultimately majored in Sociol-
ogy and Political Science, and became 
involved with the Sociology Depart-
ment’s research programs. By conducting 
research, mostly under the supervision of 
Sociology graduate students, I glanced a 
simple, yet significant, window into aca-
demia.
In my time reading academic arti-
cles for classes and conducting my own 
research, I have learned a lot. If you were 
to ask me about the difference between 
big “G” and little “g” globalization; or 
about why philosopher John Locke 
would support gun rights; or about what 
influences where college students want 
to live in the future; or about how gender 
and sexual orientation relate to one’s feel-
ings on the environment, I could talk your 
ear off. Though this knowledge doesn’t 
serve any immediate practical function, it 
has piqued my interest for the past three 
years,, and for that reason, I value it.
The University has been ranked the 
number one public research university 
in the country by the National Science 
Foundation. It spends nearly $1.5 billion 
annually on research. And its Under-
graduate Research Opportunity Program 
alone allows more than 1,300 undergrad-
uates to work with more than 800 faculty 
members on research projects each year.
But why, I wondered, does one come 
to dedicate their life to research? Where 
does this research go once it leaves the 
University? And how does it function in 
the everyday world?
To answer these questions, I spoke 
with four professors in the humanities 
and social sciences about their work and 
came to the realization that what profes-
sors lecture about in their courses is just 
the tip of the iceberg in terms of their 
knowledge and experience. Entering 

academia from a variety of backgrounds, 
they explore the nuances of their fields. 
They engage with colleagues across the 
world, and they face challenges, such as 
how their work fits into the public sphere.
F

or Fatma Müge Göçek, a profes-
sor of Sociology and Women’s 
Studies, a career in academia 
was not her original course in life. She 
was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. 
Like her family, she planned to go into 
business. But, as she finished high school 
and started college, student movements 
broke out in Turkey, which brought with 
them a wave of violence and political 
repression.
“I couldn’t, I decided, in good con-
science, make money when the whole 
society was crumbling around me,” she 
said. “As a consequence, I switched from 
being a business major to social sciences, 
and eventually to sociology.”
She was initially interested in why Tur-
key could not transition from an empire 
to a republic and sustainable democracy. 
While researching the topic, she wrote 
several books. She said she believed that 
for Turkey to have normalized violence, 
there must have been violence in its past 
that was never accounted for and that is 
what became normalized.
She looked at the Armenian genocide, 
which occurred between 1915 and 1917, 
and said she was able to understand why 
a heartless government was able to com-
mit such a massacre, but she was unable 
to understand why the Turkish people 
put up with it. In Turkey, there is still 
denial of the genocide and, in fact, its rec-
ognition is legally punishable. After the 
assassination of one of her good friends — 
an Armenian journalist — in 2007, Göçek 
fully devoted herself to the topic.
“From that point onward, I’ve been 
very active,” she said. “But as a conse-
quence — as I was working on this, giv-
ing talks — people wanted to, they think, 
slander me… (by) saying that I was Arme-
nian. There were these awful things. I 
received death threats.”
Nevertheless, Göçek has continued her 
work, although she doesn’t travel to Tur-
key but anymore. After completing her 
most recent book on the Armenian geno-
cide, “Denial of Violence,” she moved on 
to exploring Turkish violence aimed at 
the Kurdish people.
L

ike Göçek, Mai Hassan didn’t 
initially intend to pursue a 
career in academia. 
When she was a third-year undergrad-

uate at the University of Virginia in the 
mid-2000s, she learned about the Ralph 
Bunche Summer Institute. RBSI is named 
for the first African American to receive 
the Nobel Peace Prize for helping with 
mediation efforts between Israel and Pal-
estine.
It is a pipeline program for minority 
students who are interested in pursuing 
careers in academia. As Hassan noted, 
minorities are not well-represented in the 
field.
“I didn’t realize academia was a career 
for me, I (figured I would) go to law 
school, lots of political science majors do 
that,” she said.
Hassan worked on a research project 
through RBSI and conducted research 
with an economics professor at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. Through both oppor-
tunities, she learned about academia. 
When she graduated college in 2008, she 
was accepted into grad school, and since 
2016, she has been an assistant professor 
of political science at the University of 
Michigan, with a focus on African poli-
tics.
Having emigrated from Sudan to the 
United States in the 1990s, Hassan ini-
tially wanted to focus her research on 
Sudan, but found it was extremely chal-
lenging to get access and be taken seri-
ously as a young woman in the field. She 
then turned to sub-Saharan Africa, and 
her initial research focused on decentral-
ization processes in Kenya.
Hassan’s first book project looked at 
the Kenyan bureaucracy, and she is now 
looking at land allocation and registration 
in Kenya and Sudan.
F

or some of the other professors 
I spoke to, their paths into aca-
demia came as a result of their 
upbringings. In the Department of His-
tory, Jonathan Wells’s research interests 
were similarly influenced by his child-
hood in the South. 
A professor of history in the Depart-
ments of Afroamerican and African Stud-
ies and History, as well as the director of 
the Residential College, Wells has always 
been interested in American politics. His 
father was a professor of American litera-
ture, so the life of an academic appealed 
to him.
“In some ways, I grew up with a very 
privileged understanding of what does it 
mean to get a Ph.D., what do you have to 
do to get a doctorate, what does the life 
of a professor look like,” he said. “In that 
sense, I had a really early understanding 

of what it meant to be a researcher, what 
it meant to be an academic, and what it 
meant to teach in colleges.”
Wells grew up in North Carolina, and 
later near the University of South Florida, 
as his father was a professor there. He 
decided to study the history of the Ameri-
can South, as he became interested in the 
cultural and political differences between 
the regions.
His first book, “The Origins of the 
Southern Middle Class,” focused on a 
segment of the white Southern population 
that came to have careers in professional 
fields, as well as in careers as merchants 
and business leaders. 
Over time, Wells became more and 
more interested in African-American his-
tory. He was particularly interested in the 
Fugitive Slave Act, passed by Congress 
in 1850. Wells became interested in the 
implications of the law, and specifically 
the impact it had on the Northern think-
ing about slavery and the Civil War.
O

ther social scientists have 
ended up in their respective 
fields after radically pivoting 
from another area of study, which has 
helped them to engage broader audiences 
with their work. Erin Cech, an assistant 
professor in the Department of Sociol-
ogy, was an electrical engineering major 
in her undergraduate program, where 
she was interested in developing assistive 
technologies for the disabled.
However, she picked up sociology as a 
second major and became interested in 
the broader social issues of STEM educa-
tion and professions. In order to make a 
difference in the fields of STEM, she said, 
she decided to pursue an advanced degree 
in sociology.
“As I was taking my engineering 
courses, I enjoyed them, I thought it was 
interesting, but I found myself asking 
questions that my professors couldn’t 
really answer about issues of access and 
finances and things like that,” she said. 
“I sought out sociology as an intellec-
tual space that had the tools for thinking 
around those things.”
From there, Cech continued to look 
at inequality in STEM, but also at issues 
of inequality across the country broadly. 
Currently, she is interested in the cultural 
mechanisms of inequality reproduction, 
and specifically the way that certain 
taken-for-granted cultural practices and 
beliefs can help to reinforce inequality.
Most of Cech’s networks are outside of 
the University, and she collaborates with 

people across the country. She spends as 
much time on Skype calls as she does in 
in-person meetings.
Her background as an engineer has 
allowed her to engage with audiences 
outside of sociology, setting Cech apart 
from other sociology professors who 
might be only able to connect with their 
fellow social scientists. She has presented 
to chemistry departments and at National 
Academy of Engineering events, among 
other places.
Cech believes bridging this gap will 
become even more crucial in the future. 
She explained that science and engineer-
ing fields have traditionally been resistant 
to the reconciliation of the disciplines, as 
they only look to address technical issues, 
but Cech believes there needs to be more 
engagement now.
“Especially as the technical world 
becomes so much more complicated and 
the technologies that we have in our 
day to day lives are interfacing with us 
at a very high level, at great frequency, 
it means that the people designing and 
managing those technologies are going 
to need more and more knowledge of how 
the social world works,” she said.
C

ech’s multidisciplinary work 
points to a much broader ques-
tion — that of connecting aca-
demia to the public more broadly, an issue 
that is very prevalent among scholars. 
In our interview, Cech expressed that 
academics should do a better job tak-
ing advantage of “translational spaces” 
to make their work more accessible to a 
broader audience.
For 
academic 
historians, 
Wells 
explained, this has always been a chal-
lenge.
“There’s a problem in that so many of 
us write academic history that only sells a 
few hundred copies to the main resource 
libraries at other universities, so that 
means we’re essentially only talking to 
each other,” he said.
Wells pointed to David McCullough, 
who wrote a famous biography on John 
Adams, and described him as an ama-
teur historian, in order to distinguish him 
from academic historians. Wells noted 
that McCullough sells thousands of cop-
ies of his books and thus has a much more 
direct impact on the public perception of 
history than an academic historian.
“Many of us (academic historians) 
have argued that we need to be more con-
cerned about publicizing our work in the 
broader public arenas,” he said. “And the 

reason is because history, since it’s the 
study of change over time, really helps us 
form a contextual understanding for cur-
rent problems.”
Both Wells and Hassan suggested 
that the public does not necessarily have 
a good understanding of what academ-
ics do, as so much of their work occurs 
behind the scenes.
Hassan also agreed with Wells that 
perhaps academics have not done a good 
enough job conveying their work to the 
public. If an undergraduate at the Univer-
sity were to be a handed an article she has 
written, chances are they wouldn’t really 
understand it, but that isn’t necessarily 
their fault.
“It’s because we’re talking in really pre-
cise terms, there are these really highly-
defined concepts and ideas that we’re all 
trying to build on top of each other,” she 
said. “There’s a requisite level of knowl-
edge that is necessary to be able to make 
advances on some things. So I understand 
why it happens.”
She said that academia may not be 
addressing the most pressing public poli-
cy questions of the day; however, she sug-
gested this isn’t necessarily problematic. 
Many pressing questions are not theo-
retically interesting, and if a question isn’t 
theoretically interesting, it’s not going to 
appeal to academics. She explained that 
it is the role of academics in the arts and 
sciences to create new theory and allow 
people to think about things that they’ve 
never thought about before.
Göçek, on the other hand, feels she has 
been able to engage the broader commu-
nity. She explained that over the years 
she has become very interested not only 
in Turkey, but also in the United States. 
After 9/11, she began giving talks about 
Islam at churches, for instance, and 
became very interested in the perspec-
tives of minorities.
“Being a sociologist enabled me to 
engage much more in the social problems 
here, that I wouldn’t otherwise,” she said.
She has also looked for ways to engage 
students by appealing to topics they are 
interested in, such as making her classes 
relevant to them. One extremely popular 
class she has taught is called Sociology of 
Culture: From the Kennedys to the Kar-
dashians — the title alone is a draw. 
With regard to Sociology, Göçek joked 
that many people may not know the dif-
ference between a socialist and a soci-
ologist, while Cech explained that, by 
nature, people aren’t really interested in 

accepting academic notions of society.
“There’s something about the way that 
Americans tend to think about the world 
that actually, I think, limits the ability for 
social sciences, particularly sociology, 
which focuses on group processes, to 
resonate,” she said. “That’s because peo-
ple tend to think about life and their own 
experiences and the experiences of others 
in a very individualistic way.”
Nevertheless, despite the constraints 
that exist in academia, all four professors 
pointed to alternative outlets, primar-
ily in the media, as ways to communicate 
with the general public — something they 
believe is important. 
For example, Cech would “translate” 
gender research into a less jargon-y form 
for the Stanford Clayman Institute for 
Gender Research during her postdoc 
years and Göçek blogs about Sociology in 
The New York Times in Education, which 
is targeted to K-12 students, as well as col-
leges and universities.
I

f I could go back in time, I abso-
lutely would have opened those 
UROP emails my freshman year. 
I’m not sure if it would have made much of 
a difference in the end, but it would have 
given me two additional years of research 
exploration and experience.
Though I am still unsure if academia is 
the path for me, pursuing social research 
has been crucial to my time at the Univer-
sity. I have discovered that research is an 
excellent way to learn about the world, 
but also to learn about where all of the 
things taught in school originate. Profes-
sors don’t pull information out of thin air, 
despite often seeming that way.
“I think social science research is so 
important, I really feel everyone should 
give it a shot for a semester or a year — 
just to be a good citizen,” Hassan said, 
explaining that by conducting research, 
one can become confident about the infor-
mation they acquire. Otherwise, how can 
people know that what they read in news-
papers and other articles is true?
Cech echoed Hassan on the impor-
tance of the “production of knowledge,” 
but emphasized the importance of also 
making research accessible to the public. 
This type of work, she explained, could be 
extremely important for people who plan 
to pursue careers in activism or nonprofit 
work, among other opportunities.
Coming from such different back-
grounds, it stuck out to me that the four 
individuals ended up in the same place, all 
extremely passionate about what they do.

very 
semester 
starts 
with 
the 
same 
ice-
breaker: 
Where 
are 
you from, what year are you and 
what is your major? I always got 
tripped up by the first question.
I was born in Santiago de Chile 
but I left before my first birthday. 
I lived in in Pittsburgh for five 
years and by the time I was six I 
had already crossed into new state 
lines. I lived in Jonesboro, Ark., 
only to move a year later to Fayette-
ville, Ark., where I would live for 
10 years. I have spent the last four 
years in Michigan and I expect 
to spend the next seven months 
in Germany. Home, as a physical 
place, has never been something 
I can pinpoint in my mind. I can’t 
tell you what home looks like, but 
I can tell you what it feels like.
Home has always been an 
idea — it is my mom’s arms, her 
soft cadences, the smells of len-
tils cooking and my dad’s voice. 
It is these images that constitute 
my home because I have always 
left a place never to return.
I moved to Michigan while in 
the process of inventing myself. 
So, in an attempt to affirm who 
I thought I was, I hastily closed 

my chapter in Arkansas. I left in 
a flurry of emotions, and while I 
promised others I would return, 
I vowed myself to never do so. 
My story in Arkansas was an 
anomaly I wanted to let go of.
Yet, I found myself one Thanks-
giving Break in the Detroit Met-
ropolitan Airport with a ticket to 
Tennesee in hand. I sat at the gate 
and there I did the math I had 
avoided doing — it had been five 
years since I had been in Jones-
boro. As I boarded the plane, I 
didn’t feel like I was just flying 
back to the Natural State, it felt 
instead like I was going home.
I lived in Jonesboro, Ark., when 
I was six, and in this tiny town of 
75,866 residents I found my best 
friend and a family. Sierra has 
flaming red hair that glimmers in 
the sun, and in one of those magical 
coincidences of the universe she 
became my friend. I don’t remem-
ber much about my time in Jones-
boro, but I remember her. I spent 
most of my weekends at her house 
playing and eventually her parents 
became a part of my family. They 
easily adopted me. Their house is 
so ingrained in my memory that if 
I close my eyes I can walk through 

it remembering where the paint is 
chipped or the feel of the couch. 
This is what I was flying back to.
Janelle and Marcus, Sierra’s 
parents, picked me up from the 
airport — smiles adorned their 
faces, and in Janelle’s hands were 
two homemade chocolate muffins. 
These muffins were the flavor that 
greeted me every Saturday morn-
ing as Sierra and I ate breakfast. 
As I stood in the glimmering sun-
shine of the South, all the memo-
ries I had kept locked up began to 
overflow the banks of my mind.
I began to remember the South-
ern hospitality that had caught me 
off guard as I rushed around the 
airport hardly making eye contact 
and avoiding the five seconds it 
takes to say hello. I remembered 
the warm Southern air. I remem-
bered the house and all its noises.
The first hours I noticed I had 
forgotten how quiet Jonesboro 
was. I woke up my first morning 
to a silence I couldn’t remember. 
In this silence I began to stitch 
back up a past I had ignored.
Walking through the house, I 
remembered spending the morn-
ing in the window room gazing out 
to the vast open yard covered in 

autumn leaves. I remembered the 
nooks and crannies that Sierra and 
I discovered as we played hide and 
seek. I remembered sitting under 
the piano while Marcus played. I 
remembered the dining room and 
how I had learned the word vege-
tarian there. I remembered sitting 
in Michigan thinking of Janelle’s 
chair empty when she told me she 
had been diagnosed with cancer.
On returning home I realized 
the immense hurt I had caused 
myself. Being back allowed me to 
reclaim this past but most impor-
tantly to embrace it as part of who 
I am. Maybe my time in Arkan-
sas doesn’t make sense, maybe 
there were episodes in my child-
hood there I wished had never 
occurred, but by ignoring those 
I was also shutting out home.
I was erasing my childhood 
with Sierra. I was erasing Janelle 
and Marcus who have never 
stopped inviting me back. Their 
small family, of quirky English 
professors and my best friend, 
were the ones who encouraged 
me to keep reading and writing.
For me home is still the 
idea but it is now also that 
house 
on 
Church 
Street.

The Comical Strangeness of 
Second-Hand Embarrassment

BY SAM ROSENBERG, SENIOR ARTS EDITOR
H

eavy breathing, a rapid heartbeat, trem-
bling knees, a tightened throat — these are 
typical symptoms for someone who expe-
riences performance anxiety. You know, that noxious 
feeling you get when you’re about to go onstage and 
speak, dance or sing in front of a crowd of people. I’ve 
had that anxiety for most of my life. Depending on the 
circumstances, I naturally become nervous and over-
whelmed when the attention is put on me, especially 
when I don’t see it coming. And while I have been 
able to find healthy coping mechanisms for combat-
ing these nerves, there is another anxiety I have that 
is a bit harder to figure out: “second-hand embarrass-
ment” — that icky, white-hot, skin-crawling panic 
you get when you watch someone else perform, wor-
ried that they might mess up or when you’re in a con-
fined setting and something uncomfortable occurs.
Like most of my neuroses, this anxiety stems from 
a somewhat traumatic experience I had growing up. 
When I was about three years old, my family and I 
saw a kids-only production of “Peter Pan” that my sis-
ter starred in. She played Jane and was hooked onto a 
wire in order to create the illusion that she was flying. 
Even though she didn’t fall, just the mere thought of 
her crashing down onto the floor was enough to make 
me erupt into a volcano of tears. Ever since then, I find 
myself on edge whenever I’m among a large gather-
ing of spectators at all kinds of public events — movie 
theaters, lectures, plays and musicals, you name it.
As a prepubescent boy, this anxiety manifested most 
often whenever I heard sexually explicit rap and pop 
music at parties, particularly ones of the bar mitz-
vah variety. The fact that there were adults around 
us while Lil Jon yelled, “To the sweat drop down my 
balls!” made me want to collapse into oblivion. Hear-
ing LMFAO talk about getting their cocks sucked was 
equivalent to nails on a chalkboard. And I’m pretty 
sure Kesha’s “Blah Blah Blah,” with its cringe-wor-
thy, hypersexual lyrics, almost gave me a heart attack 
once — no offense to Kesha. I love her other songs, just 
not that one. At my own bar mitzvah party, I specifi-
cally told the DJ to bleep out the cuss words in “Boom 
Boom Pow” by The Black Eyed Peas, but imagine my 
horror when I heard Fergie rap “I’m on that next shit 
now” as I danced with my oblivious aunt. That period 
of awkwardness has thankfully subsided, but look-
ing back on it, I’m a bit sad this unshakable dread 
robbed me of having a good time at these kinds of 
parties, frequently forcing me to leave the dance 
floor and seclude myself in a bathroom or somewhere 
far enough away where I couldn’t hear anything.
Watching movie trailers in a movie theater can also 
be really difficult for me. I know that sounds strange, 
but just hear me out. I tend to watch a lot of movie trail-
ers on YouTube out of paradoxical boredom and obses-
sive interest, and I’ve seen so many that I am able to 
distinguish which trailers are bad and formulaic. If it’s 
a trailer for a studio comedy, there’s likely going to be 
quirky characters in quirky situations, jarringly swift 
editing, a light pop song to lighten the mood and some 

cheesy line of dialogue that doesn’t line up with what 
the character is saying on-screen. If it’s a trailer for a 
drama, there’s usually a solemn orchestral score, sad 
or serious-looking characters undergoing a serious 
change, a morose indie folk song or a funny moment to 
lighten the mood. These kinds of repetitive formulas 
might not bother the regular moviegoer, but for some 
reason they unsettle me. Maybe it’s because I find dis-
comfort in their emotionally manipulative attempt at 
advertising the movie. Maybe it’s because I worry about 
how those around me might react, and that their reac-
tions will be negative. Maybe I’m just too quick to judge.
Whatever the case, it’s something I have a difficult 
time controlling. It’s even more disorienting when 
movie theaters put trailers that don’t match the tone or 
genre of the movie that I’m there to see. This past sum-
mer, I went with my family to see “Tully,” a dramedy 
about a struggling mother of three who hires a night 
nanny, and the trailers that played before it were “The 
Darkest Minds” (a boilerplate “Divergent” ripoff), 
“Johnny English Strikes Again” (that goddamn Brit-
ish action comedy franchise that has zero justification 
for its continuance) and “Hotel Transylvania 3: Sum-
mer Vacation” (are you fucking kidding me?). Knowing 
how out-of-place these trailers were and the mortified 
response they could elicit from the audience, I looked 
straight down at the ground for the entire duration of 
the trailers because I knew I would probably explode 
right there on the spot if I glanced up at the screen.
It seems odd that visual and aural stimuli are the 
main agents that stir this stress inside me, consider-
ing how much I love music and film. Even when I’m 

not at a movie theater or at a party, I somehow am 
still capable of experiencing second-hand embarrass-
ment induced by mundane, everyday occurrences. 
For instance, witnessing a technical malfunction 
or interruption during a lecture — like when a video 
has trouble buffering, when there’s a commercial for 
a movie that plays beforehand or when the professor 
forgets to turn off AutoPlay and another video appears 
— is probably one of my top 10 fears of all time. See-
ing a college a cappella group perform a medley of 
suggestive pop songs is also a big no-no for me — if 
I wanted to watch a sexy rendition of a Top 40 jam, 
I’d just watch “Pitch Perfect.” Both situations, while 
equally upsetting, can trigger me for different rea-
sons. I tend to cringe at the incompetence of the for-
mer scenario and the ostentatiousness of the latter.
Suppressing this anxiety has not been easy. It’s 
one of several insecurities I have that I’ve only been 
able to curb either by managing it or discussing it. 
My strategies for managing it range from incessantly 
doodling in my journal to typing out my thoughts in 
the Notes app on my phone to excusing myself and 
waiting alone outside for an extended period of time. 
And usually, I get a mix of bewilderment and fasci-
nation when I tell my family and friends about this, 
which is expected because it’s not something people 
tend to talk about when it comes to mental health 
discourse. Anxieties are strange, especially ones 
that feel very specific to who we are. It is only when 
we can share our experiences that we can maybe 
harness some power over the things that inhibit 
us from being the very best versions of ourselves.
