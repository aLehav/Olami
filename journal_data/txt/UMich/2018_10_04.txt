Over the past several years, 

University of Michigan-based 
startup Moxytech has been 
developing an app that lets 
medical patients explain their 
pain to a doctor by drawing it 
on a 3-D model. Founded in 
2014, the company allows users 
of the app GeoPain to highlight 
which areas hurt and indicate 
how much pain they are in to 
professionals.

Moxytech 
Co-Founder 

Alexandre DaSilva, director 
of the University’s Headache 
and Orofacial Pain Effort, said 
the app — which was released 
to the public in September — 
is an invaluable resource and 
part of a logical progression in 
evaluating patients.

“I’m a clinician, and when 

I was doing my doctorate I 
was looking at the brain of 
patients with pain, and with the 
technology they have, they were 

much more precise,” DaSilva 
said. “But in the clinic, it was 
always subjective. Even though 
I could look at very high-tech 
things in the research side, in 
the clinical side, to correlate 
things, it was much harder, 
because I had to ask my patients, 
‘zero to ten, what’s your pain,’ 
which was very subjective.”

DaSilva also believes the app 

is useful for patients because 
makes it easier for them to 
accurately 
describe 
their 

symptoms.

“I started to create a grid so 

the patient could put not only the 
intensity of the pain but where 
the pain was,” DaSilva said. 
“So that started to really help 
me with my research. When I 
arrived here in Michigan, then 
I realized that the 2-D map, the 
drawing, was not really good 
for the patients, because a body 
is in 3-D. The patients in the 
studies, and even those in the 
clinics, they were excited about 
this. ‘Hey, I want to use that, for 

At the first panel of the 

Carceral 
State 
Project 

Symposium 
Wednesday 

night, panelist Justin Gordon, 
an activist and University of 
Michigan 
alum, 
asked 
the 

crowd of University faculty 
and students to listen and 
care about young Black people 
affected by inequality and mass 
incarceration.

“Why don’t you all listen to 

us?” Gordon said. “Why don’t 
you all listen to young Black and 
Brown people until it happens? 
You all don’t listen to nobody, 
until they make you listen. Until 
they break into your house 
because they ain’t got no food. 
Or because they sell your kids 
drugs. That’s why I’m up here, 
because you all don’t listen, you 
all don’t care unless somebody 
do something and make you all 
care.”

This roundtable, the first 

in a yearly series presented by 
the Carceral State Project with 
support from other University 
departments, centered around 
the challenge of defining the 
carceral state. Panelists with 
expertise on criminal justice and 
defense, mass incarceration, and 
conditions in prisons engaged in 
a dialogue on how to attempt to 
solve these issues.

Before introducing all the 

panelists, 
moderator 
Ruby 

Tapia, an associate professor in 
English and Women’s Studies 

and one of the Carceral State 
Project’s founders, explained 
the term carceral state for the 
audience.

“The 
carceral 
state 

encompasses 
the 
formal 

institutions 
and 
operations 

and economies of the criminal 
justice system proper, but it also 
encompasses logics, ideologies, 
practices and structures that 
invest in tangible and sometimes 
intangible 
ways, 
including 

orientations to difference, to 
poverty, to struggles for social 
justice, and to the process of 
constructing orders at all times,” 
Tapia said.

The Carceral State Project 

is a new cross-disciplinary 
initiativeby various professors 

to open a new center dedicated 
to research of America’s prisons 
and criminal justice system, 
as well as granting degrees 
to incarcerated individuals in 
Michigan correctional facilities. 

After the panelists introduced 

themselves, Tapia asked them to 
recall an experience illustrating 
the importance of the work 
they 
do. 
Ronald 
Simpson-

Bey, the director of Outreach 
and Alumni Engagement at 
JustLeadershipUSA, 
talked 

about his time in prison and how 
his experience led him to show 
mercy for the teenager who 
killed his son. Simpson-Bey also 
spoke of how his experiences 
led him to JustLeadershipUSA, 
an organization dedicated to 

decreasing 
the 
incarcerated 

population.

“Being someone that had been 

in the system and experienced 
what I 

experienced, I did not want to 

see that child being treated the 
way I’d seen people treated in 
prison,” Bey-Simpson said. “So I 
advocated for him to be tried as 
a juvenile, instead of as an adult 
… Fast forward, the work that I 
do now for JustLeadershipUSA, 
we are committed to cutting the 
national prison population in 
half by 2030.”

Mary Heinen McPherson, 

co-founder 
and 
program 

coordinator 
of 
the 
Prison 

Creative Arts Project, also talked 

A new form of teaching 

dubbed “active learning” has 
started to slowly make its way 
into a variety of classrooms at 
the University of Michigan.

This new model attempts to 

engage students more deeply 
with content through more 
mandatory 
participation 

in discussions and small-
group work. This operates 
in contrast to the traditional 
“passive learning” technique 
used in the typical lecture 
format. 

Students 
often 
admit 

to 
missing 
their 
packed, 

300-seat lectures or losing 
their attention span. LSA 
sophomore Victoria Sheetz 
said she is barely awake when 
she attends lectures.

“I constantly find myself 

falling asleep due to the 
monotonous structure of my 
lectures,” Sheetz said. “A 
lot of classes have aspects 
of 
repetition 
that 
don’t 

make

panel Wednesday, which drew 
approximately 60 people for

Despite conventional wisdom 
that computer labs are in decline, 
whenever I go by the “fishbowl” on 
the #umich central campus, nearly 
every station is in use. Perhaps due to 
larger monitors, or printers, or quiet 
workspace, but I don’t see demand 
waning any time soon.

cultural understanding and 
bilingualism in the education 
system. 
The 
discussion 

also included strategies for 
students to find success in 
school and the workforce.

According to Social Work 

student Stuart Inahuazo, the 
discussion 
offered 
support 

and encouragement for first-
generation 
students 
while 

commenting on the poor state 
of the education system for 
Latinx students. 

“As someone who is a first-

generation college student, or 
college graduate now, I really 

enjoyed how they spoke of 
what the pressing issues are 
for the Latinx community,” 
Inahuazo said. “I really do 
think to give the students 
access and to be able to give 
them an opportunity to grow 
and to obtain these resources 
is important, but it does show 
we don’t have the resources 
currently to get that for the 
Latinx community.”

Last school year, the Latinx 

Alliance 
for 
Community 

Action and Support published 
demands 
calling 
on 
the 

University to increase the 
share of Latinx executives, 
staff 
and 
faculty 
across 

campus. A recurring message 
in 
the 
discussion 
was 

increasing staff members in 
the education system who 
were culturally competent, or 
more aware of other cultures, 
to 
relate 
with 
students. 

Inahuazo said though there 
were 
many 
conversations 

during the panel, cultural 
competency was one of the 
most important lessons. La 
Casa also requested a “LatinX 
Campus Climate Study” to 
assess the opinions of Latino 
students, faculty and staff 
on campus and to further 
support additional programs 
— a campus climate survey 
last 
year 
found 
Hispanic 

students are 132 percent more 
likely than white students to 
experience discrimination. 

“One of the biggest 

takeaways was, in the 
whole 
sense, 
cultural 

competency. To be more 
open-minded 
on 
how 

(the staff) perceive their 
students, 
especially 

people of color and Latinx 
students, 
just 
because 

many could be first gen 
or it could be their first 
time far away from home,” 
Inahuazo said. “To be 
able to understand their 
perspective, to be able 
to give them a chance to 
speak up in classrooms 
or to give them resources 
necessary, 
I 
think 
it’s 

important for teachers and 
faculty to understand to be 
much more open-minded 
of other cultures.”

LSA 
sophomore 

Thania 
Flores 
said 
it 

is encouraging to hear 
successes of other women 
like her.

“It’s important to have 

Latinx representation and 
see other Latinx alumni 
(and to) see what they’re 
doing,” Flores said. “That 

will motivate me to see what 
my future has as a Latinx 
woman.”

Martinez hopes students 

will 
use 
the 
panel 
and 

discussion as an opportunity 
to work together to progress 
the state of Latinx education.

“I hope that they take away 

that we are at a critical point 
in history where we must lock 
arms with one another in order 
to identify low-hanging fruit 
and opportunities to create 
greater clarity for parents and 
great clarity for students on 
how to access post-secondary 
opportunities.”

MICHIGAN CONCE RT BAND

RUCHITA IYER/Daily

Michigan Concert Band performs at Hill Auditorium Wednesday night. 

YouTube clip or a segment 
from a television show, but 
more often than not you can 
expect the same structure 
every time you attend. A lot 
of the time, the simplicity 
of the lectures rarely leave 
any room for discussion. 
I feel like I would retain 
the information better by 
learning it myself.”

The 
University 
will 

attempt to broaden its usage 
of the novel model with the 
help of a recent $1.8 million 
grant from the National 
Science Foundation. Cindy 
Finelli, the director for 
engineering 
education 

research at the University, 
will work with a group 
of 
professors 
–– 
Maura 

Borrego, Jenefer Husman 
and Michael Prince –– in 
attempt to research the 
fundamentals 
of 
active 

learning and distribute the 
findings to U-M faculty. 
Finelli hopes the findings 
will 
bolster 
student-

classroom participation and 
communication.

“When 
instructors 

successfully 
use 
active 

learning in a classroom, 
students 
can 
learn 
the 

material more deeply and 
apply principles better in 
different contexts,” Finelli 
said in a press release. 
“Their self-confidence and 
their ability to communicate 
with 
each 
other 
can 

improve, and they often 
begin to identify themselves 
as future engineers instead 
of as students just taking a 
required course.”

In 
some 
classrooms, 

active learning can already 
be found in the required 
discussion sections of many 
STEM-based classes, such as 
organic chemistry, physics 
and biology. In a similar way, 
writing 
workshops 
serve 

this function through essay 
and short story analysis 
during class discussions, in 
addition to peer-reviewing 
classmates’ work.

LSA 
sophomore 
Sofia 

Salinas 
has 
observed 

the 
active 
learning 

approach in two of her 
classes, 
Introduction 
to 

Anthropology and Creative 
Writing, but she said she 
had mixed thoughts about 
the changes.

“I feel like the active 

learning 
isn’t 
successful 

in my anthropology class. 
In small groups, we get 
distracted and talk about 
other 
things. 
I 
would 

rather have the GSI go 
over things that we find 
confusing. 
However, 
I 

do find it engaging and 
think 
it’s 
healthy 
to 

build 
relationships 
with 

classmates 
and 
bounce 

ideas off of each other, but 
I would also like some more 
structure,” 
Salinas 
said. 

“In my creative writing 
class, I like talking about 
the readings. It helps a 
lot actually. It helps me 
understand 
better 
–– 

hearing 
other 
people’s 

ideas 
and 
perspectives. 

But I don’t think it would 
work for chem or math, 
because I think that with 
those classes, having the 
professor go step-by-step 
with the problems will help 
you, rather than trying to 
figure it out with other 
confused students.”

On 
the 
other 
hand, 

LSA 
sophomore 
Kendall 

Johnson praised the honors 
study group offered by her 
Structure and Reactivity 
class. She said she found the 
option to attend the group 
that meets in the classroom 
once a week for two hours 
necessary for success in the 
class.

“We don’t have any class 

time for assignments –– 
they pretty much have to 
be complete by the time 
you come to class. We peer-
review, though, and quick 
fixes are allowed. Overall, 
you kind of have to know 
what you’re doing in order 

to 
participate 
in 
class 

discussion,” Johnson said. 
“It’s not boring, and it’s 
definitely a lot of learning 
and practicing the material. 
I’m not a huge chemistry 
fan, so I wouldn’t call it the 
most engaging or exciting, 
but that’s part of the reason 
I wanted to do the group. I 
wanted to study and work 
in a way that would make 
sure I really got to know 
the material in the hopes 
that it would help me when 
it comes to the actual class 
and tests.”

Public policy senior Tom 

Aiello agreed that active 
learning has been a positive 
addition to his University 
courses. 
He 
thinks 
it’s 

improved his understanding 
of class materials. 

“Active learning is a good 

way to break up otherwise 
monotonous lectures and 
try 
to 
explain 
complex 

concepts in my own words,” 
Aiello said. 

A 
downside 
of 
active 

learning is that the format 
is enacted through another 
class, thus failing to replace 
the 
traditional 
lecture 

model. Though it encourages 
students to interact more 
intimately with the content, 
it increases pressure on 
students to participate.

In the case of the second-

year Italian program, for 
example, the entire course 
is structured as a “flipped-
classroom.” This requires 
students to complete online 
homework 
and 
grammar 

lessons alone, and in class 
employs group-work that 
spans for the entire 50 
minutes.

Prof. Michela Russo, one 

of the multiple second-year 
Italian 
instructors, 
said 

she finds active learning 
beneficial 
for 
language 

students because it mirrors 
real-life 
situations 
when 

traveling 
to 
a 
foreign 

country.

“You do in class what 

you cannot do by yourself. 
When you put in the effort, 
that is when you really 
begin to understand things 
and allows you to speak 
a wider majority of (the 
language), beyond just basic 
grammar structure,” Russo 
said. “When a student is an 
active participant in class, 
it is more effective in the 
language context because 
it’s similar to what you 
would be doing in a real-
life situation when you’re in 
the middle of the street, or 
you’re in a new city. You’re 
not going to be thinking 
about grammar, you’ll just 
be reacting to different 
situations. You need to find 
your own strategies and 
make 
people 
understand 

you, so this is why we 
discuss in class.”

Nonetheless, this form of 

active learning still comes 
with some pushback. LSA 
sophomore Jillian Rice feels 
as if the class has begun to 
feel like a lecture. Rice said 
she expects the same type of 
lesson every day; though it 
is delivered differently than 
the conventional lesson, it 
has none of its own variety.

“I do not find the active 

learning model effective at 
all,” said Rice. “In class, we 
do not address what we are 
supposed to be learning at 
home. This causes confusion 
while doing the homework 
because we must learn all of 
the topics strictly from the 
textbook. In my opinion, it 
is much easier and clearer 
to learn from a teacher and 
in-person. I would benefit 
much more from a mixed 
classroom model. I believe 
that the point of homework 
should be to practice and 
reiterate what was learned 
in class, rather than the 
other way around. There 
is almost no incentive to 
come to class because all 
of the class time is spent 
talking to other classmates 
about 
things 
that 
most 

likely will not be covered on 
exams or anything else that 
determines our grade in the 
class.”

about her time in prison. She 
talked about the sexual assault 
women in prison experienced, 
and the extreme overcrowding 
creating unlivable conditions. 
The most dangerous aspect of the 
carceral state, McPherson said, is 
the invisibility of the issues.

“The 
malignant 
carceral 

state is by and large invisible,” 
McPherson said. “You can’t see 
it, you don’t know what’s going 
on back there because they block 
access to mail, to the phones, to 
visits, to your money. You have no 
way of being able to communicate 
with the world what is happening 
to you.”

According to Victoria Burton-

Harris, 
a 
criminal 
defense 

attorney, the unlivable conditions 
McPherson described change 
the mentalities of incarcerated 
individuals. When released, the 
individuals may find it difficult to 
adjust to the outside world. When 
prisons treat people like animals, 
Burton-Harris said, these people 
return to the civilian world with 
animalistic survival instincts. 
For this reason, among others, 
Burton-Harris said she aims 

to 
humanize 
her 

clients.

“They’re traumatized, they 

can’t find jobs and they are 
on survival mode,” Burton-
Harris said. “They oftentimes 
commit more crimes simply in 
an attempt to survive. And we 
don’t understand that, and we 
as a society tend to judge that … 
My job is to try and humanize 
my clients. I don’t call my client 
defendant in the courtroom. 
That’s not who they are. They’re 
Mr. Jones. Mrs. Smith. They’re a 
mother, father, a husband. And I 
need the judge and the jury to see 
them as who they really are.”

When Tapia asked about 

how the University can use its 
resources to find solutions to 
these social justice problems, 
panelists 
had 
a 
variety 
of 

responses. 
Burton-Harris 

emphasized the need for people 
to visit prisons and interact with 
those communities.

“I don’t think that sitting in a 

building doing research is going 
to solve it,” Burton-Harris said. 
“Get out on the streets. Go to the 
prisons. See what I’m saying, see 
what all of us are saying. See what 
they’ve lived. Smell the air. That’s 
the research you need to do.”

Simpson-Bey built on Burton-

Harris’ 
point, 
stressing 
the 

necessity 
of 
research 

that needed to encompass the 
perspectives of people who have 
lived in prison.

“Research is necessary, and 

I think research needs to be 
updated because there is a lot of 
research out there, but it doesn’t 
include the voices of those 
directly impacted,” Simpson-
Bey said. “The majority of the 
research out there is done by 
people basing their papers on 
theories and suggestions instead 
of talking to people who have 
actually lived these experiences.”

Monica 
Lewis-Patrick, 
an 

activist from Detroit at We The 
People, 
also 
discussed 
how 

crucial it is to speak with these 
communities and learn about 
their experiences. She urged 
the University to take greater 
concern with education and 
housing crises in Detroit as well 
as the Flint water crisis.

“You tell me on God’s green 

earth, why is Flint still not fixed 
when I’m sitting at one of the 
greatest engineering schools in 
the world?” Lewis-Patrick asked.

Gordon 
spoke 
about 
the 

Ann Arbor-Detroit divide and 
the privileged bubble of the 
University, 
which 
recently 

received an F in representation 
of Black students on campus. 

Gordon 
pointed 
out 
the 

audience was majority white, 
and expressed how people in his 
Detroit community don’t have 
the same luxury to attend these 
types of talks.

“Why is it all white people in 

the audience when we talking 
about jail?” Gordon said. “I mean, 
like what? That’s cool, I’m glad 
you’re all here to listen … but we 
don’t have these conversations 
in my neighborhood, because we 
don’t have time. You all have the 
privilege to be up here and take 
notes and absorb. We want that 
privilege.”

LSA senior Hoai An Pham said 

Gordon’s point resonated with 
her, as she feels students often 
speak about liberal topics but 
often don’t go the extra mile in 
taking actual action.

“I think what Justin was 

saying about the disconnection 
between Detroit and Ann Arbor 
was really important, because I 
think oftentimes students forget 
what a privileged place this is,” 
Pham said. “People often think 
that learning about things is 
enough, we oftentimes have the 
privilege to do more than that.”

To help inspire the audience

the center was found to be no 
longer cost-effective.

“Following 
the 

recommendations 
of 
a 

recent internal review of the 
China Data Center, it has 
been determined that the 
University will not undertake 
remediations that would have 
been required to continue 
hosting 
the 
CDC,” 
the 

statement read.

CDC Director Shuming Bao 

explained the University sent 
him notice Sept. 24 that the 
center would be closed within 
days. Bao says the University 
provided 
vague 
responses 

to his inquiries about the 
internal review and he is still 
largely unaware of why the 
University made the sudden 
move to disaffiliate from the 
center.

“They did address some 

concerns but nothing really 
solid,” Bao said.

Broekhuizen explained the 

internal review concluded the 
CDC site would have required 

the University to make costly 
repairs and upgrades.

“The 
review 
identified 

serious technology upgrades 
that were needed, which were 
not the best use of university 
resources,” 
the 
statement 

provided read. “As a result, 
CDC and its related websites 
and tools will no longer be 
available from or associated 
with 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan or ICPSR.”

However, Bao claimed the 

CDC receives private funding 
and the center paid the ICPSR 
for technical assistance.

“The 
CDC 
has 
been 

financially 
on 
its 
own 

resources for years, and CDC 
paid ICPSR for computing 
support,” Bao said. “I am 
not sure how it will cost the 
ICPSR for those technological 
upgrades.”

Additionally, 
Bao 
said 

he was unsure as to which 
technological upgrades the 
University was referring in 
the statement. He explained 
the CDC had a security issue 
two years ago with a hacker, 
which 
was 
resolved 
with 

help from the University’s 

Information and Technology 
Services. 
But 
since 
then, 

the CDC has adopted more 
intense 
security 
measures 

and not detected any security 
issues. 

Bao also said the CDC has 

a significant amount of funds 
that can be allocated to any 
technological upgrades the 
University deems necessary. 
He still has hope the CDC can 
reconcile with the University 
and ICPSR.

“CDC left over $1 million 

on our account to ICPSR 
at the time of its closure, 
which probably should be 
good enough to fix any tech 
upgrades if there are some 
issues there,” Bao said.

For now, the CDC has moved 

to a separate online domain 
but remains unaffiliated with 
the University. While many 
users are satisfied that they 
can access the data center 
through the alternate website, 
scholars and other academic 
professionals shared concerns 
about a data center unlinked 
to an institution.

Christoph 
Steinhardt, 

University of Vienna assistant 

professor 
of 
East 
Asian 

studies, has previously used 
CDC data numerous times for 
various research projects, but 
said he is unlikely to utilize 
the unaffiliated center.

“I would be hesitant to use 

their data until I know more 
details on the reasons behind 
their separation from UMich 
(the 
currently 
released 

information is cryptic and 
sounds like something was 
seriously wrong),” Steinhardt 
wrote in an email.

Steinhardt explains it is 

critical for a data center to be 
affiliated with an accredited 
university, and until there is 
more information about the 
CDC’s new host, he will not be 
using the center’s data.

“Data from China is more 

trustworthy 
if 
a 
reputed 

Western university is behind 
it,” Steinhardt wrote. “At 
present, 
it 
seems 
some 

company 
from 
Beijing 
is 

running the site. Without 
more 
information 
on 
the 

sponsor, I would probably 
rather look for other sources 
of data.”

my own good, and show it to my 
doctor,’ (they said).”

Moxytech’s other co-founder 

Eric Maslowski discussed how 
important it is to ue technology 
in the medical fields in order to 
optimize medical procedures.

“When I was at Michigan, I’d 

always been captivated by the 
meaningful uses of technology,” 
Maslowski 
said. 
“Not 
just 

technology for technology’s sake, 
but to actually use it as a positive 
agent on larger groups of people.”

The app is now used in various 

medical offices across the state 
of Michigan, including those 
of Dr. Thiago Nascimento, a 
pain research investigator in 
the University Research Lab. 

At the time the app was first 
being developed, Nascimento 
was a student of DaSilva’s, 
allowing him plenty of hands-
on experience with the app. 
Nascimento explained how the 
app played a valuable role in 
patient evaluation.

“The drawing of the pain (was 

useful). Every time somebody 
had pain, you ask them ‘one 
to 
ten,’” 
Nascimento 
said. 

“However, that doesn’t really 
paint the picture of how they’re 
feeling, it’s not very precise, not 
very accurate. We were studying 
the technique of giving the 
patient a 2-D or 3-D space, so 
they can visualize it, something 
better than a number. It’s easy 
for us to kind of to see what the 
patient is feeling, although it’s 
just a drawing … For me, a more 
visual guy, it was useful. ‘Okay, 

you have pain in your head,’ is 
okay, but to have the patient 
draw for you how it spreads 
and the progression of the pain 
(was 
helpful).”Nascimento 

said the app helped bridge the 
gap between the rudimentary 
medical knowledge of most 
patients and the expertise of the 
doctors.

“You kind of find common 

ground,” Nascimento said. “You 
can remove that gap. The doctor-
to-patient relationship, it makes 
it easier for them (the doctor) to 
explain what’s going on. We’d 
start with the app: ‘Okay, just 
tell me how you’re feeling and 
let’s try to see the picture and 
compare.’ Like, let’s look and 
see how you were feeling a few 
months ago, and how you’re 
feeling today … It was easier for 
us to even track the follow-up 

– Are you feeling better or not – 
instead of just choosing a random 
number, like, ‘Before it was a 7, 
now it’s a 6.’ You can really see, 
‘Oh, you’re getting better.’ It was 
clear for us to see.”

According 
to 
Nascimento, 

the app had helped him learn 
as a student as he studied under 
DaSilva.

“Back 
in 
the 
day, 
with 

their first versions, just to be 
optimized, it was good for 
them to also use our feedback, 
not only the feedback from the 
patients, but ours (the students),” 
Nascimento said. “You have the 
theory in the classroom, and you 
try to apply the concepts. For 
us, it was like, ‘Okay, we learned 
that, but we don’t see it used in 
the app.’ So it was good for us 
to give them some feedback as 
well.”

n 2017, Under Armour CEO 
Kevin Plank said President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
“pro-
business” policies are 
“a real asset” to the 
country, 
and 
Under 
Armour stock fell 40 
percent. Sam Poser, an 
analyst for Susquehanna 
International 
Group, 
told Business Insider 
Plank’s 
praise 
for 
Trump made it “nearly 
impossible to effectively 
build 
a 
cool 
urban 
lifestyle brand in the 
foreseeable future.”
In 2018, Nike released a new 
marketing campaign, the face 
of which is Colin Kaepernick, 
the former San Francisco 49ers 
quarterback who Trump once 
called a “son of a bitch.” Kaepernick 
is best known for protesting police 
brutality by kneeling for the national 
anthem during professional football 
games, a move that has been highly 
criticized 
primarily 
by 
those 
who identify with a conservative 
political ideology. Kaepernick no 
longer plays professional football, 
allegedly because his protests 
are so controversial that no team 
wants to deal with the backlash 
that will come with signing him. 
The New York Times described 
Kaepernick as “the most polarizing 
figure in American sports,” saying 
“outside of politics, there may be 
nobody in popular culture at this 
complex moment so divisive and 
so galvanizing, so scorned and so 
appreciated.”
When he became the face of 
Nike’s new marketing campaign, 
Nike’s online sales increased 31 
percent and its stock closed at $85 a 
share, a company record.
This is the young, urban 
consumer base. You can love 
them, you can hate them. You can 
disagree with them. But if you’re 
in marketing, none of that matters. 
Your goal is to make money. If 
you’re marketing for an athletic 
wear company, you make money 
by appealing to the young, urban 
consumer base.
Kaepernick kicked off Nike’s 
marketing campaign on Sept. 3 
by tweeting a picture of his face 
and a message that read, “Believe 
in something. Even if it means 
sacrificing everything.”

This post, and Nike’s campaign 
video (which now has more than 
26 million views), sparked a fire. 
A 
Quinnipiac 
poll 
showed the majority 
of those 18 to 34 years 
old approve of Nike’s 
Kaepernick ads, while 
the majority of those 
65 years and older 
disapprove of the ads.
Customers 
(and 
former 
customers) 
on both sides made 
their 
views 
known. 
Kaepernick supporters 
applauded Nike for “doing the 
right thing” as if it was a purely 
altruistic decision in which Nike 
sacrificed profits to show its 
support for racial justice. Critics of 
Kaepernick had equally loud voices, 
as #BoycottNike and #JustBurnIt 
trended on Twitter the whole day 
Nike released the ad campaign.

The 
reactions 
of 
both 
sides show Nike executed this 
marketing campaign effectively: 
Nike convinced its consumer base 
that it used Kaepernick as the 
face of its campaign because it 
wanted to make a statement about 
his protests, not because they 
used statistics and data to make a 
risky but well-calculated business 
decision. 
Matt Powell, a vice president 
and senior advisor at The NPD 
Group, confirmed this analysis; 
“I think Nike went into this 
absolutely knowing what they 
were doing, with the intention that 
some people would be offended,” 
he told the The New York Times. 
“But the people buying their 
products, whether they are a 
millennial or a Gen Z consumer, 
those consumers want their brands 
to take visible, social positions, and 
this is an opportunity for Nike to 

do just that.”
In fact, Nike had initially been 
planning on dropping Kaepernick 
completely. It made logical sense: 
Kaepernick is no longer signed 
with any NFL team, so they can’t 
put his name on any jersey. But 
as an undisclosed former Nike 
employee told the New York 
Times, Nigel Powell, Nike’s head of 
communications, “went ballistic” 
when he heard this decision. 
Analysts say “the largely white, 
older N.F.L. fans angry at the league 
over (Kaepernick’s) protests” aren’t 
a priority for Nike.
Instead, their target customer 
base is a younger, more urban 
demographic who is passionate 
about racial justice and tends to 
support Kaepernick’s protest. As 
Fast Company noted, “The bulk 
of Nike-sponsored athletes are 
young and black, so the company 
is already aligned with Kaep’s 
issue and why it matters.” This 
group would have undoubtedly 
been furious if Nike dropped 
Kaepernick, and this is the group 
whose support Nike needs. As Josh 
Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth 
Management, tweeted, “Nike is 
marketing to their customer of the 
next thirty years, not the last thirty 
years.”
Granted, it was a risky decision. 
But in this day and age, companies 
don’t have much of a choice when 
it comes to taking a risk. If a 
company chooses not to speak 
out about a controversial social 
issue, it risks losing its customers 
to a company that will speak out. 
According to a recent survey from 
Morning Consult, urban and young 
consumers “were more likely to say 
they would react favorably to a 
company that advocated the right 
of protesters to kneel during the 
national anthem.”
Sports 
apparel 
companies 
learned the hard way last year that 
one mild comment in support of 
Trump can be detrimental. This 
year, they learned that what may 
appear to be an extreme and risky 
decision in support of an anti-
Trump public figure is a fantastic 
business decision. Love it or leave 
it, that’s what the market demands.

Hard change is good change
“

My parents took me to Paris 
when I was 13 and the minute 
I saw the Eiffel Tower, I knew 
I was going to study abroad here, 
eventually.”
“My mom studied abroad in 
Spain, so I want to follow in her 
footsteps.”
“I’m trying to visit a new 
country every weekend. I’ve had 
this planned out since freshman 
year.”
None of these thoughts were 
going through my mind. To be 
completely honest, I didn’t submit 
my abroad application until the day 
it was due. My hesitancy to commit 
was a result of mixed emotions, an 
internal battle and parental and 
peer influences.
Growing 
up 
in 
Michigan, 
having 
some 
of 
my 
closest 
childhood friends follow me to the 
University of Michigan and being 
a short 45-minute drive from my 
parents all made my transition 
from 
high 
school 
to 
college 
smooth. As much independence 
as college life provided me, I still 
felt like I was in my senior year of 
high school; I had the same friends, 
the same interests and the same 
need to text my mom every day. I 
consistently have had the comfort 
of entering a new space with at 
least one person with which I’m 
familiar. I haven’t been challenged 
to navigate a new place on my own 
or make an entirely new friend 
group. Some may think of this as a 
privilege, but to me I felt sheltered. 
 
Junior year came around and 
the talk of the campus was, as per 
usual, the question of whether 
people would be studying abroad. 
I knew I was behind my other 
classmates who had already filled 
out their applications. On the 
other hand, I was still making pro-
con lists every day, having tense 
conversations with my parents, 
and spending hours opening and 
closing the Center for Global and 
Intercultural application page. I 
kept thinking: What do I want to 
do? What do others want me to 
do? My parents were anxious and 
uncomfortable with the thought 
of me living in another country 

for four months. In relation, none 
of the friends in my apartment 
were going abroad, so they eagerly 
started making exciting plans for 
next semester. Meanwhile, my 
mind was racing with opposite 
feelings: This would be an entirely 
unique experience. I’ve never left 
home before. I’m the type of person 
who needs this.
Despite 
these 
contrasting 
opinions, I still decided to research 
what programs would fit me best. 
The Danish Institute for Study 
Abroad seemed like a match made 
in heaven. I could get credit on 
my transcript, the classes seemed 
educationally engaging and I guess 
living in Copenhagen, Denmark, 
for four months is a perk as well. 
Step one was complete once I 
was able to convince my parents, 
ignore the external pressures and 
verify my beliefs about how a study 
abroad experience could benefit 
me.
Arriving 
in 
Copenhagen 
was an adventure itself. I truly 
didn’t know what I was getting 
myself into. However, the minute 
I stepped into my apartment 
and met my roommates, I felt a 
sense of belonging. These were 
my people and this was my place. 
It’s crazy how being in the right 
environment made me feel right at 
home so quickly.
The first day of class rolled 
around and, of course, I was 
nervous. Psychology classes with 
less than 20 people? Does that 
even exist? Where’s the graduate 
student instructor? My worries 
continued throughout the day 
into my developmental disorders 
class. The teacher went around 
the room and asked each of us to 
complete the sentence: “I’m the 
type of person who …” As it got 
to my turn, I just stated what was 
on my mind. I quietly said: “I’m 
the type of person who wouldn’t 
go 
abroad.” 
Everyone 
turned 
their heads with a puzzled look. 
I went on to explain I have lived 
a life of sameness without any 
drastic changes. I explained I’m 
not usually someone who would 
be confident in moving across the 

world for four months, meeting 
new friends and navigating a new 
city. This seemed to be a sufficient 
answer as everyone nodded and 
smiled.
However, at the end of the 
semester, our teacher asked us 
the same question with a twist. 
She wanted us to complete the 
following sentence: “After this 
semester, I’m now the type of 
person who …” I didn’t even have 
to hesitate. My answer was: “I’m 
now the type of person who would 
feel comfortable going abroad.” 
In other words, after befriending 
my amazing roommates, learning 
a new language, meeting Danes, 
figuring out how to bike and use 
the transportation in a new city, I 
truly felt like I could do anything. I 
gained more knowledge about the 
benefits of change and just how 
much I am capable of. The friends 
I made also pushed me to be my 
most confident and best self.
In conclusion, my decision 
to go abroad was not something 
that had been part of my life-long 
plan. It was more of a spontaneous 
reaction to my gut feelings. I’ve 
never been happier that I was able 
to put all other doubts and negative 
feelings aside. If there’s one thing I 
recommend, it is to push yourself 
out of your comfort zone. For those 
of you who are not sure whether 
you have the “right personality” 
or “are capable of such a dramatic 
change,” try not to let those 
thoughts affect your decision. 
As much as jumping out of a 
plane or summiting a mountain 
can feel like being out of your 
comfort 
zone, 
nothing 
beats 
living in a new place, with new 
people, in a new culture and only 
letting yourself make the decision 
of whether to take advantage of 
these opportunities. By allowing 
myself to do what I wanted to do, 
in this case, something different, 
I eventually became the person I 
wanted to be.

Why Nike really made Kaepernick the face of its campaign

The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board 
calls 
upon 
the 
Ann 
Arbor City Council and the 
state of Michigan to take more 
affirmative steps to inform the 
Ann Arbor community of the 
dangers of PFAS, mitigate the 
damage that has been done and 
implement strategies to protect 
citizens from further harm.
Perhaps the most concerning 
aspect of the growing threat 
posed by PFAS is the fact that it 
is a relatively unknown danger. 
PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances, encompass a wide 
family of chemicals that are 
used in industrial, agricultural 
and manufacturing processes. 
PFAS can be found in many 
everyday objects and goods, 
including commercial household 
products, drinking water near 
contaminating 
facilities 
and 
organisms like fish that live in 
contaminated 
water 
sources. 
Because the PFAS family of 
chemicals does not naturally 
occur, 
they 
take 
years 
to 
decompose. Consequently, the 
buildup of PFAS in the body can 
cause devastating health effects.
While PFAS is a growing 
danger for all who work, live 
and play around Michigan’s 
waters, the efforts to alert the 
public to the potential hazards 
of PFAS exposure have been 
minimal. Though signs do warn 
residents against drinking the 
foam buildup in the Huron River, 
little has been done to make 
citizens aware of the existence of 
PFAS in the water supply and the 

potential harm of overexposure. 
The state of Michigan’s website 
does have a “Frequently Asked 
Questions” page about PFAS, 
but the answers downplay the 
severity of the issue. This lack of 
information stands in contrast 
to the way a public health crisis 
should be handled.
As a result, many affected 
residents are unaware of the 
danger they are in. Not only does 
the city of Ann Arbor need more 
information, less affluent cities 
in northern Michigan require 
assistance and attention. So far, 
the state — and country — have 
put profitable companies before 
residents’ health and passed 
lax regulations regarding water 
safety. This is especially true in 
areas that do not have the money 
in their city budgets to challenge 
the companies responsible for 
pollution or decontaminate the 
water supply themselves.
The 
lack 
of 
information 
circulating 
about 
PFAS 
is 
exacerbated by weak federal 
standards 
regulating 
the 
chemicals. 
The 
absence 
of 
national 
benchmarks 
(aside 
from 
unenforceable 
recommendations) means Ann 
Arbor 
is 
completely 
reliant 
on its City Council and state 
government 
for 
spreading 
information, 
enforcing 
protection 
mechanisms 
and 
conducting 
damage 
control 
where necessary.
Adept Plastic Finishing, Inc., 
an industrial plant in Wixom, 
plans to install a filter to reduce 

PFAS 
contamination 
in 
the 
Huron River. To compensate 
for Environmental Protection 
Agency standards, Adept Plastic 
Finishing developed its own 
filter and will enforce its own 
regulations. In a perfect world, 
all 
PFAS-emitting 
companies 
would follow the example set by 
Adept Plastic Finishing.
However, 
until 
business 
interests stop being prioritized 
over clean drinking water and 
the health of Michigan residents, 
regulatory 
legislation 
is 
necessary to protect Michigan’s 
water supply.
The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board urges the Ann Arbor City 
Council to inform and protect 
its citizens from the dangers 
of 
PFAS 
and 
contaminated 
drinking water. At the same time, 
we urge the state of Michigan 
and the federal government to be 
more proactive and to prioritize 
environmental 
health 
over 
corporate bottom lines. Without 
action, this pattern will become 
debilitating – much like the PFAS 
in our water.

What even is Michael Cera Day?

Dear Michael Cera,
You may be wondering why the 
heck a college student newspaper 
in Michigan is dedicating a day to 
you in print. Truthfully, Mr. Cera, 
I have no freaking clue. What I 
do know is that discussing your 
filmography brought a zealousness 
out of my fatigued staff of writers 
that I haven’t seen since Oscar’s 
season.
In the sad spread of September 
wide 
releases 
and 
mediocre 
streaming 
specials, 
the 
film 
writers of The Daily were out of 
sorts, dejected and depressed by 
the outlook of the film industry. 
But you, Mr. Cera, you brought 
us out from this dark place and 

invigorated our creative juices. 
You reminded us what we college 
journalists and movie snobs love 
about your films. We love the nice 
guy. You know, the character you 
play in each of your films is the 
quintessential nice guy. Whether 
it be the adorkable, tic-tac-tossing 
Paulie Bleecker in “Juno” or baby-
faced Nick from “Nick and Norah’s 
Infinite Playlist” or even the boyish 
charm of George Michael Bluth 
in “Arrested Development,” we 
know your honest and realistic 
performance of nerds in love won’t 
disappoint. We can count on you, 
Mr. Cera, to remind us of the kind 
of guy we want and need in this 
time of toxic masculinity, rampant 
sexism and misogyny. You are a 
good one, or at least we think so. 
Please don’t make us regret this.
You embody the sweet chump 

that society tells us will finish last 
and probably will, but we keep 
rooting for you. You are the vice 
president of pasty white dorks 
because President Pete Davidson 
got more votes than you, by like, 
a lot. You are the cousin our mom 
tells us we need to bring to prom 
even though you go to a different 
school and it would be really nice 
and maybe there’s a set of air 
pods in it for us. Even though we 
thought it would be rough, we had 
a great time. You sprained your 
neck trying to do the worm and 
slipped on some punch, but overall, 
solid time. You are the one who at 
parties stands in the corner and 
nods nonchalantly, kind of just 
looking around in a way that’s less 
creepy and more just odd. And 
every time you wave to someone, 
they either pretend not to see you 

or just ignore you, so you are left 
there just sort of waving at nothing. 
So you use the hand that’s waving 
and scratch your head or start 
doing the “Single Ladies” dance 
to cover up the fact that no one is 
responding to your wave.
So Mr. Cera … can we call you 
Michael? Are we on that level yet? 
Yeah, we like it better too. Michael, 
we just want to say thanks. Thanks 
for making films that always make 
us a little uncomfortable, but in 
a good way, usually. Thanks for 
reminding us that sometimes the 
nice guy does get the girl. Thanks 
for unapologetically being your 
awkward, high-pitched, delightful 
self: We appreciate you. On this 
Michael Cera Day, we honor you. 
Happy you day! 
Love,
The Daily Film Writers

‘Superbad’’s perfect straight-man

Let’s 
be 
honest, 
“Scott 
Pilgrim vs. The World” wasn’t 
ever going to age gracefully. 
As a film, it’s essentially the 
embodiment 
of 
late-2000’s 
internet 
culture, 
from 
its 
frequent references to retro 
video games to its slightly 
dated slang to its pink-haired 
“Manic 
Pixie 
Dream 
Girl” 
love-interest. So yeah, “Scott 
Pilgrim” is pretty unapologetic 
about what it is, and this can’t 
really come as a surprise. I 
mean, it’s a movie about a guy 
who has to fight a girl’s exes 
to be with her. It’s not exactly 
going to pass the Bechdel test 
with flying colors. 
Most films don’t age well. 
I don’t think that’s a very 
controversial 
statement. 

So long as a movie is given 
time, it will likely find itself 
in violation of some now-
unacceptable social norm that 
was once the status quo. “Scott 
Pilgrim” definitely falls victim 
to this phenomenon, flaunting 
incredibly 
dated 
messages 
about gender and sexuality. 
Ramona 
(Mary 
Elizabeth 
Winstead, “All About Nina”) is 
written with little depth and 
exists more like an aloof and 
quirky accessory to Scott’s 
story (Michael Cera, “Arrested 
Development”) than a three-
dimensional character with her 
own desires and motivations. 
At multiple points throughout 
the movie, I found myself 
thinking, “Why is she with 
him?” and found little in the 
way of a convincing answer. If 
this weren’t enough, the film’s 
LGBT characters — like Scott’s 
roommate 
Wallace 
(Kieran 
Culkin, “Infinity Baby”) and 

Ramona’s ex-girlfriend (Mae 
Whitman, 
“Duck 
Butter”) 
— 
are 
little 
more 
than 
hypersexualized punchlines. 
As we’ve established, plenty 
of films age poorly and are 
still enjoyed today (looking at 
you, “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”), 
but something makes “Scott 
Pilgrim” especially graceless. 
Let me preface this by saying 
that I love video games and 
I had fun with the movie’s 
use of video game tropes and 
references. But here’s the thing 
about people who love video 
games: Some of them are the 
worst. My friends can attest 
that I would never be caught 
dead referring to myself as 
a “gamer,” and with good 
reason. A not-so-insignificant 
number of 2010’s nerdy, retro-
loving white guys are 2018’s 
QAnon, 
4chan-esque 
red-
pillers 
espousing 
obscenely 
hateful, misogynistic rhetoric. 

Of 
course, 
“Scott 
Pilgrim” 
couldn’t have known this, but 
while watching it one can’t help 
but feel that they’re watching 
something that contributed to 
a toxic internet culture that 
normalized 
misogyny 
and 
ignorance. 
Despite all of this, “Scott 
Pilgrim” director Edgar Wright 
(“Baby Driver”) still managed 
to do what he set out to do: He 
kept me entertained. “Scott 
Pilgrim” 
is 
an 
undeniably 
impressive 
effort 
from 
a 
filmmaking perspective, one 
that crackles with energy and 
creativity. At this stage in his 
career, 
Wright 
had 
proven 
himself to be a master of 
creating visually compelling 
films, and “Scott Pilgrim” is 
legitimately a joy to watch. The 
fight scenes are impressively 
choreographed, the editing is 
smart and genre-relevant and 
the integration of visual effects 

is clever and fun. It would be 
very easy for me to write off 
“Scott Pilgrim” as yet another 
stylish film with little in the 
way of compelling characters 
and messages.
It would be easy, but it 
wouldn’t exactly be honest, 
either. 
Despite 
its 
flaws, 
“Scott Pilgrim” isn’t just some 
heartless slugfest. Scott is a 
surprisingly deeper character 
than Michael Cera’s typical 
man-boy 
persona; 
he’s 
an 
awkward jerk, yes, but Cera’s 
signature brand of passivity 
and low self-esteem makes 
him just endearing enough to 
root for. His character arc is 
both satisfying and believable, 
and Wright manages to do the 
unthinkable: He actually turns 
Michael Cera into kind of a 
badass. To stroll into spoiler 
territory for a moment, Scott 
realizes he must defeat Gideon 
(Jason Schwartzman, “Golden 

Exits”) — Ramona’s final ex — 
not with the power of love, but 
with the power of self-respect 
during 
the 
film’s 
climax. 
It’s a surprisingly touching 
moment, and one that sends an 
important message: The only 
kind of love that can fix your 
self-esteem is the kind you give 
yourself. 
“Scott Pilgrim” falls victim 
to a trap that’s essentially 
unavoidable for filmmakers: 
Culture changes, and what was 
once relevant, funny or socially 
acceptable can now prove to be 
none of those things, and there 
are moments of the film that 
fail on all three fronts. Like 
hanging out with your grandpa 
who sometimes says some stuff 
he doesn’t mean, there remains 
enough at the core of the film 
— mostly stemming from Edgar 
Wright’s inimitable style and 
heart — for the experience to 
feel rewarding.

Reappraisal: ‘Scott Pilgrim’ ages poorly, retains its fun

Michael Cera cut his teeth 
as George Michael Bluth on 
“Arrested 
Development,” 
acting alongside one of the 
best comedic straight men of 
his generation, Jason Bateman 
(“Ozark”). 
By 
the 
time 
“Superbad” 
introduced 
the 
younger actor to mainstream 
audiences, it seemed like some 
of Bateman’s gift for po-faced 
wit had rubbed off on Cera. The 
opening credits, which feature 
brightly-colored silhouettes of 
Cera and co-star Jonah Hill 
(“Maniac”) 
dancing 
in 
the 
style of a ’70s porn film cement 
this: Hill’s dancing is animated 
and confident, while Cera’s is 
more reserved. On more than 
one occasion, Hill stops Cera 
to demonstrate how the job is 
really done.
It’s an early glimpse into 
the relationship that defines 
the film. Cera is far from the 
buttoned-down 
introvert 
stereotype that most comedies 
would have rendered Evan 

as, but he’s still restrained 
in comparison to Hill’s Seth 
and spends a good deal of 
“Superbad,” or at least the 
first 
half, 
reacting 
to 
his 
friend’s insane quest to lose 
his virginity. It 
would have been 
easy to turn the 
performance into 
a 
perpetually 
raised 
eyebrow 
and 
shaken 
head, but Evan 
is so much more 
than 
that 
in 
the 
same 
way 
“Superbad” is so 
much more than 
a typical romp. 
In Cera’s hands, 
he becomes the 
perfect 
straight 
man 
for 
the 
perfect teen sex 
comedy.
Much of what works about 
the performance can be traced 
to what works about the film 
as a whole. It allows him to be 
hilarious — “Fuck off, Greg, 
it’s soccer. It’s soccer” — but 
it also treats Evan as a fully-
formed character, giving Cera 

space to portray a believable 
emotional struggle. For all 
the weird, outlandish crap 
that they get into over a single 
night, Evan and Seth always 
feel like real teenagers with a 
real friendship. 
They talk like 
real 
teenagers, 
overanalyze 
every 
social 
interaction like 
real 
teenagers 
and do nothing 
but try to prove 
to 
themselves 
and 
others 
that 
they’re 
adults, like real 
teenagers. They 
clearly 
love 
each other even 
before they say 
it out loud — 
a fact that is 
never played for 
laughs, a rarity even now, over 
10 years later — and they’re 
wondering what life is going to 
be like without each other, just 
like teenagers.
When they fall out, it’s 
a 
genuinely 
heartbreaking 
scene, and Cera doesn’t pull 

his punches. Most of the scene 
is Evan rebuking Seth, as the 
former wants to mature but 
isn’t sure how to reconcile 
that with their friendship, 
and the latter doesn’t want 
to grow up if it means losing 
their closeness. By the end of 
the movie, both will have been 
confronted with the flaws in 
their thinking. Seth has to grow 
up and own his immaturity 
in his interactions with Jules 
(Emma Stone, “Maniac”), and 
a drunk-out-of-his-mind Evan 
must depend on Seth in order 
to “escape” the police. Much 
of “Superbad” acts as either 
a satire or subversion of the 
unhealthy ways men express 
their masculinity — through 
guns, sex, booze or fighting 
— but Evan and Seth discover 
that the best way to grow up 
and “be a man” is to actually 
grow the hell up.
And of course, it almost 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
“Superbad” is incredibly funny 
and Cera is incredibly funny in 
it. Much of the humor hasn’t 
aged a day, and the scene where 
the world was introduced to 
the wonder that is McLovin 

JEREMIAH VANDERHELM
Daily Arts Writer

If not an advert for life after 
love and a belief in the universe 
of 
second 
chances, 
“Juno,” 
the 2007 epitome of indie, is 
a stalwart defender of orange 
tic-tac 
aphrodisiacs, 
color-
safe bleach and the idea that, 
to the question of belonging, 
there’s not one answer that fits 
everyone. 
Centered 
around 
16-and-pregnant 
Juno 
(Ellen 
Page, 
“Flatliners”), 
Diablo 
Cody’s (“Tully”) script aims 
at evaluating a few particular 
cross-sections 
of 
modern 
(white) American life, pulling 
the 
poignancy 
of 
the 
film 
out of the thin intersections 
between 
them. 
Just 
about 
every important character in 
the film is a part of a romantic 
couple, each binary pair mired 
with their own setbacks and 
emotional deficiencies.
The juxtaposition of these 
couples is the heart and soul of 
this coming-of-age spectacle, 
specifically how one character’s 
hoard of life-experience versus 
another 
character’s 
dearth 
can change how each of them 
responds to a certain situation. 
It’s fantastic writing, and for 
once a Best Original Screenplay 
winner that isn’t masochistically 
sad. Now, without reducing 
the girl-power of this female-
written, female-starring teen-
pregnancy-flick, 
I 
want 
to 
bring to the forefront of the 
conversation the men in the 
proverbial overly knick-knacked 
Minnesota living room. 
Cody’s excellence with the 
pen can be seen in just these 
three 
characters 
alone, 
the 
three 
father 
figures 
almost 
as different as they could be, 
however fundamentally linked. 
Juno’s father Mac MacGuff 
(J.K. Simmons, “Whiplash”) is 
on his second of two marriages, 
content in his new life, though 
inexorably linked to his ruinous 
first 
attempt. 
Mark 
Loring 
(Jason 
Bateman, 
“Horrible 
Bosses 2”) is a dream-chasing, 
middle-aged man who believes 

he has not chased his rock-star 
aspirations far enough. Feeling 
unfit for the suburbs, he comes 
to question all that had brought 
him there in the first place. 
And at the head of this paternal 
Cerberus, the most biologically 
potent of AP chem students, the 
cross-country runner batting 
1000 from downtown, gold-
shorts Paulie Bleeker (Michael 
Cera, “Superbad”) himself — a 
geeky high-school junior who 
must deal with the fact that he’s 
impregnated his gregarious best 
friend (and that he’s also in love 
with her).
Cera plays the most pivotal 
role of the three fathers in the 
movie. Complete with all the 
awkward, 
endearing 
charm 
he has brought throughout his 
career, Cera plays Page’s more 
timid opposite — the more 
reserved, simpler one of the 
two, whose wholesome honesty 
with Juno is able to bring her 
back around in the end. Cera has 
played these types of characters 
before — his style as an actor is 
the perfect counterpart to the 
standard, precocious to the point 
of annoyance, a role that a lot of 
young actors/actresses bring to 
the table. Cera’s characters are 
always approachable, because, 
for better or for worse, there’s 
not much intimidating about 
him. I think in a slightly skewed 
way, Cera’s late 2000s run can 
find an analog in Adam Driver’s 
recent success. Both are actors 
who play a perfect “everyman” 
— solid performers who don’t 
look like traditional movie stars, 
and who are able to peel back a 
layer of ego to bring roles down-
to-earth. Of course, this type 
of character, this type of actor, 
isn’t going to find their way 
into every big role in every big-
budget movie. Their niche is, for 
better or for worse, in the types 
of heartfelt indie projects that 
come out of individual creative 
minds like Cody’s. They’re the 
Alfonso 
Gomez-Rejons 
and 
Bo Burnhams of the world, 
directors who can pick out talent 
that turns characters into real 
people on screen. And at least to 
me, there can never be enough of 
them.

introvert and ... 
a father figure?

MICHAEL CERA DAY

remains one of the high points 
of comedy in the 21st century. 
Hill’s infuriated shouting is 
what most will remember, but 
Cera’s deadpan summation of 
the whole ordeal is the perfect 
punchline: “This guy is either 
gonna think, ‘Here’s another 
kid with a fake ID’ or ‘Here’s 
McLovin, 
the 
25-year-old 
Hawaiian organ donor.’”
It could certainly be argued 
that Cera has never gotten 
another 
role 
as 
perfectly 
suited 
for 
him 
as 
Evan, 
another part that lets him 
loose low-key gut busters with 
dizzying frequency yet also 

tap into surprising emotional 
depth. 
“Scott 
Pilgrim 
vs. 
the World” comes close, and 
he voiced the best onscreen 
Robin of all time in “The 
Lego Batman Movie” just last 
year, but that unquantifiable 
something has never clicked 
back into place. This shouldn’t 
be seen as a condemnation of 
his career in the years since, 
however, though it’s certainly 
regrettable. Rather, it should 
be a reminder, should we 
ever need one, of the quality 
of 
“Superbad” 
and 
more 
importantly, the quality of its 
pasty co-lead.

It could certainly 
be argued that 
Cera has never 
gotten another 
role as perfectly 
suited for him as 
Evan

and that guided how we created 
the musical. We created it in a way 
that lends itself to having a strong 
story at its core that has the ability 
to be adapted — hence the novel. So 
much so that during the process, 
sometimes Justin would say, ‘Are 
we sure we want to make this a 
musical and not a play?’” 
The path of sharing the story 
with the world at large begins in 
early Oct., when the creators will 
embark on a 10-day book tour to 
speak to audiences and promote the 
book. On Oct. 11, the duo will return 
to Ann Arbor, the place where it all 
began. Justin Paul and Benj Pasek 
met in Ann Arbor, where they 
both studied for a BFA in musical 
theatre, and feel very passionately 
about coming back to the place 
where it all started.
“I think it’s a really sweet 
time because as we look back on 
everything, it reminds us how it 
isn’t that far away — college and 
learning things and our very early, 
mediocre, 
sloppy 
attempts 
at 
writing songs. That all happened in 
those practice rooms late at night. 
Our first songs together started 
in our friends’ apartments in Ann 
Arbor, in Kerrytown Concert 
House performances. This is all 
the beginning of what has led us to 
come back and speak to students,” 

began Justin Paul, sentimentally.
Benj Pasek picked up his 
statement with similar emotive 
feeling.
“It feels like such a long time 
ago, but it also feels so grounded, 
and it gives us so much hope for 
people. This is what happens when 
you’re surrounded by incredible 
people who are passionate about 
collaborating and learning. That’s 
what we learned at Michigan.”
It’s a really special thing to 
think about the places that we, as 
University students, go every day: 
the practice rooms we play the 
piano in for hours, the lecture halls 
where we learn and the studios 
where we create. We think about 
the potential before us, and about 
those who have been here and gone 
on to achieve greatness.
As a huge fan of Levenson, Pasek 
and Paul, I was curious as to what 
advice they have for young people 
interested in a career in the creative 
arts.
“Before you can be a theatre 
major, you need to be a theatre 
watcher. So much of the curve you 
go on as an artist is to find what 
electrifies you. Get as many free 
tickets as you can. See as much as 
you can. Read as much as you can,” 
Paul said passionately.
Pieces of art like “Dear Evan 

Hansen,” a musical where story 
makes love to melody and lyric, 
electrify so many of our tired, 
trying, anxious artist hearts. In 
the last moments of such a fervent 
conversation, I was excited to find 
out why the creators believe the 
book is a necessary installment 
in the modern American literary 
world.
“I think we’re really struck with 
the fact that we’re living in a time 
that people don’t want to speak to 
each other. ‘Dear Evan Hansen’ 
is about our desire and our ability 
to connect with people,” Pasek 
claimed, and without missing a 
beat, Paul picked up smoothly mid-
sentence:
“We all feel a little bit lonely. 
We all feel a little bit detached. 
And we all feel a longing to be 
a part of a community. We see 
these characters having to cross 
difficult lines or have difficult 
conversations. That’s the message 
of this piece.”
The novel is guaranteed to 
open the door (or window, rather) 
for difficult conversations, inner 
exploration 
and 
eye-opening 
truths. It is a truly sensational 
addition in the world of young adult 
fiction, a piece of art that will last 
in our minds and our hearts “for 
forever.”

“Ok Michigan Daily! We see 
you!” was the greeting Benj Pasek 
and Justin Paul welcomed me with 
in a spare moment of their busy lives 
as burgeoning Broadway legends. 
To my elation, the University 
alumni were thrilled to converse 
with a fellow Wolverine.
Coming off of their 2017 Tony 
Award for “Dear Evan Hansen,” 
2018 Oscar for Best Original Song 
for “La La Land” and 2018 Grammy 
for Best Musical Theatre Album 
for “Dear Evan Hansen,” the pair 
is on the precipice of embarking on 
a national book tour, following the 
release of a “Dear Evan Hansen” 
novel.
Their 
acclaim, 
fame 
and 
popularity 
run 
rampant 
in 
mainstream pop culture and the 
theatre world alike these days. 
Writing the score for 2017 smash 
hit “The Greatest Showman,” 
Broadway musical “Dear Evan 
Hansen” and Oscar-nominated 
“La La Land” certainly fostered 
quite the following. In addition 
to a resume stacked with film 
and stage musicals, the duo has 
also written original material for 
NBC’s “Smash” and the 2012 Off-
Broadway musical “Dogfight.”
Their newest project takes them 
away from their home in musical 
theatre and into the literary world, 
pairing them with author Val 
Emmich and “Dear Evan Hansen” 
writer Steven Levenson to create 
a novelization of the cherished 
Broadway musical, allowing the 
musical to fill the minds of those 
who don’t have access to seeing the 
musical live.
When asked if he anticipated 
that “Dear Evan Hansen” would 

blow up the way it did the duo and 
writer Steven Levenson laughed.
“If we said yes, would you believe 
us?” Levenson asked, pausing. “No, 
we didn’t know. All three of us 
can confirm that when we began 
working on this show, we knew it 
would be incredibly fulfilling in the 
process of writing it — but we didn’t 
know the world would gravitate 
toward it.”
The 
world 
is 
more 
than 
gravitating toward “Dear Evan 
Hansen” — they are ravenous for 
it. This past week the New York 
musical grossed $1,444,251, with 
average ticket prices at $181 and the 
top ticket going for $488.
The audience reaction was 
nearly immediate — when the team 
saw the audience respond to the 
out-of-town tryout in D.C., they 
realized that people were going to 
truly fall in love with the characters 
they had created.
Putting characters that have 
been created for the stage on the 
page is unusual in the theatre 
world. Society is familiar with 
page-to-screen adaptations, or even 
page-to-stage, but the concept of 
transforming a musical into a novel 
is uncommon.
When the team first brought the 
show to Broadway, they started 
to notice that people were really 
connecting to the story and wanted 
to make it their own. People were 
hungry to dig into these characters 
and go deeper into their journey. 
And that’s the moment the team 
knew that the piece would thrive in 
a variety of mediums.
They wanted to expand to reach 
more people — especially those 
who do not have access to seats 
in New York’s Music Box theatre 
or the newly-launched national 
tour. They had to stop and ask 
themselves how they could reach 

a wider audience and go deeper — 
finding pieces of the story that were 
lost in the process of writing it. This 
in and of itself is a thrill — being 
able to find nuggets of story and 
character they had to omit in the 
musical, and breathe them back to 
life. They wanted to make this story 
as accessible as possible, and that’s 
just what the novel seeks to do.
Responding 
to 
questions 
with 
a 
synchronized 
passion 
and heightened enthusiasm, it is 
clear that the three creators are 
mastering the art of collaboration. 
Where one leaves off, the other 
picks up seamlessly — almost 
sounding like one mind. For them, 
working together is a special 
alliance.
When Benj Pasek and Justin 
Paul went looking for authors 
who could work with them on the 
novel, they looked for the same 
things they had found in Steven 
Levenson (who wrote the book of 
the musical). They wanted to find 
someone who was in the world of 
Evan Hansen with them, who had 
the same language, who found the 
same things funny or ironic or sad. 
And that’s how they found author 
Val Emmich. They wanted this 
story, in all its forms, to fit together 
seamlessly — to feel like it has one 
voice.
After having the privilege to 
see the musical, it certainly feels 
as though the piece has one voice, 
and the novel is no exception to 
this sentiment. One thing that truly 
sticks out to me as exceptional in 
the musical is the dialogue. Pasek 
and Paul give the credit of such 
wonderful dialogue and character 
development to Levenson.
“‘Dear Evan Hansen’ the musical 
is basically a play with songs,” Pasek 
said. “Steven is a master of dialogue 
and character and relationships,

Novelist Sigrid Nuñez on 
her process & inspiration

ARTIST PROFILE

When I asked novelist Sigrid 
Nuñez about the inspiration behind 
her latest book, “The Friend,” her 
answer was both surprising and 
not surprising.
“A few years ago,” she said, “I 
realized that I had several friends 
who had started thinking about 
suicide. Not necessarily that it was 
something they were going to do, or 
that they were threatening, or that 
they were in immediate danger 
— but it had started becoming 
part of the way they thought, a 
stronger and stronger possibility 
that (suicide) was something that 
very likely might happen to them 
sometime in the future.”
On Sept. 27, Nuñez and poet 
Aracelis Girmay spoke at UMMA 
as part of the Zell Visiting Writers 
Series. Nuñez read from her 2017 
novel “The Friend,” which is 
longlisted for the 2018 National 
Book Award in Fiction.
A 
pattern 
of 
philosophical 
repositioning 
among 
Nuñez’s 
friends may seem like unlikely 
source material for a novel, but 
Nuñez, a prolific and uniquely 
talented writer, mines inspiration 
from all parts of her life. She is 
emphatically unafraid to draft 
responses 
to 
the 
questions 
and curiosities of the human 
experience. “The Friend” is the 
most recent result of this eager 
attentiveness to the world.
On “The Friend”
At turns heartbreaking and 
delightful, “The Friend” traces 
the interior life of a writer 
whose mentor has committed 
suicide. While taking care of her 
mentor’s aging Great Dane, the 
writer expounds on the nature of 
companionship, aging, love and the 
act of writing. “The Friend” is a joy 
to read, for both its language and 
the urgent necessity of its content.
There 
are 
two 
central 
relationships guiding the narrative 
of “The Friend” — one between 
the writer and her mentor, and one 

between the writer and the dog. 
Nuñez leaves it ambiguous which 
partnership the title refers to; 
perhaps it is about both. Nuñez’s 
frank empathy for humans and 
animals structures the novel’s 
dense interiority and grounds its 
frequent digressions into history, 
literature and culture.
“I’ve always been interested 
in animals, I’ve always been 
fascinated by animals and I always 
wanted to write something that 
would have an animal that would 
be a main character,” Nuñez 
explained.
Of the novel’s relationships with 
other texts, Nuñez explained that 
her own experiences as a writer, 
reader and teacher pushed her to 
write about the role of literature in 
a writer’s life. 
“I’ve spent my life reading, 
writing and teaching literature and 
writing,” she said, “and I’ve been 
so engaged in that for such a long 
time that there was a lot I had on 
my mind about that.”
Suicide, a dog and literature 
are an uncommon trifecta of 
ingredients, but Nuñez manages 
to combine them exceedingly well.
“I felt I had a story that could 
bring these three things together,” 
she 
explained. 
The 
elements 
converge organically, which says as 
much about the material as it does 
about Nuñez’s writing style and 
methodology.
On the writing process
Nuñez’s writing materializes 
spontaneously.
“I’ve never worked from an 
outline for any of my fiction books,” 
she said. “With the fictional work, 
I never have an outline — not for 
short fiction or long. I just start 
writing. I make a beginning and 
then I proceed from there.”
She doesn’t rush the writing 
process, either.
“I work in sections,” she said, 
“linearly, 
chronologically, 
one 
thing after another, and I don’t 
move on to the next section until 
I’m more or less satisfied with 
what I have. Everything comes out 
of what was written before.”
While writing, Nuñez uses both 

a computer and handwritten notes.
“I’ll use the computer as a 
word processor — as a typewriter, 
basically. I’ll type something out 
and then make some changes and 
then print it out and work on the 
printout by hand. But most of it, 
really, at this point, is done on the 
computer,” she said.
“It 
probably 
has 
changed 
things,” Nuñez said of her use of 
technology as a tool for writing. 
“But it’s too hard for me to see 
how, because other things — such 
as time and life and experience 
and practice and age and all those 
things — have also changed, so it’s 
hard for me know, actually, what 
has changed, going from somebody 
who did write in longhand a long, 
long time ago.”
Still, Nuñez emphasizes the 
importance 
of 
incorporating 
handwritten notes into her editing 
practice.
“There always has to be a 
hardcopy and a pencil in my hand 
for the final draft,” she explained.
In both form and content, 
Nuñez’s work pushes its reader to 
think more deeply about the world 
and its inhabitants. In regard to her 
intended audience, Nuñez does not 
write with one in mind.
“I don’t really think about the 
audience of my work. I guess I 
just have in my mind some kind 
of ideal reader, and that would 
just be a person who likes to read, 
who likes to read fiction and who is 
interested in the same things that 
I’m interested in.”
On becoming a writer
Becoming a writer was not a 
difficult choice for Nuñez, and 
books have been an important part 
of her life since childhood.
“Something that was really 
important to me when I was a 
little kid was being read to, before 
I could read myself, and then 
reading,” she said. “So I was one of 
those kids who loved to read, it was 
a favorite activity. I loved children’s 
books; I was always trying to get 
my mother to read to me. And then, 
you know, that made me want to 
do that. It was really as simple as 
that.”

MIRIAM FRANSISCO
Daily Arts Writer

“Books and writing and stories 
made me happy,” Nuñez explained. 
Literature is not Nuñez’s only 
creative pursuit; as a teenager, 
she became obsessed with ballet. 
“I did do that very seriously, and I 
thought, ‘Oh, I want to be a dancer, 
there’s nothing I want more than 
to be a dancer and that was closer 
to a fantasy than a reality.’ But 
that’s the only other thing, really, 
that I could say was an idea for a 
career.”
Rather than pursue dance, 
though, Nuñez committed herself 
to the world of reading and 
writing.
“There was always creative 
writing,” she said of her of 
childhood 
and 
adolescence. 
“Then, when I got to college, there 
were creative writing workshops. 
It was always there; it was always 
encouraged.”
Nuñez’s 
natural 
tendency 
toward keen observation helped 
her 
coalesce 
her 
childhood 
interests in literature and writing 
into a career.
“I think it was Henry James 
who said that a writer is somebody 
who has to notice everything, 
who can’t miss anything,” Nuñez 
explained.
Nuñez certainly does not miss 
anything, and she fills her books 
with the kinds of details that only a 
writer would think to articulate. It 
is this earnest perceptiveness that 
bridges the divide between fiction 
and reality, interior reflection and 
outward-facing analysis.
“You can almost tell who is a 
writer or who could be a writer,” 
Nuñez began, “by the fact that 
they are always noticing things.”

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘DADDY’

“Daddy”

Tommy Genesis

Interscope Records

It’s time to hide all your dads, 
because Tommy Genesis fans 
are officially on the hunt after 
the release of her newest single 
“Daddy.” The track — featuring 
production from Charlie Heat 
(credited on one of her other 
singles “Tommy”) — opens with 
a staccato flurry of high-pitched 
moans before dropping into the 
immediately provocative opening 
line: “He like me better with no 
makeup / Oh, you wanna get it, 
daddy?” From the start, Tommy 
opens the gates to her chaotic, 
alluring fantasy of raw desire and 
unbalanced attraction.
Tommy 
is 
masterful 
at 
painting these fantasies, speaking 
to our deepest, darkest desires 
for the glamorously taboo — road 
head, coke and sexual fluidity are 

just a few of her favorite topics. 
Her music’s subject matter is 
thrilling, delivered with an air 

of complete nonchalance that is 
almost intoxicating in context. 
How could you not want to be 
her?
“Daddy” is Tommy at her 
most biting, most menacing 
and certainly most enticing. 
“He just say he love me, I can’t 
say it back / He just bought me 
diamonds, I don’t feel bad,” she 

quips softly over the disorienting 
production with an enviable 
hint of detachment. Her brand is 
inspiring, awakening a demonic 
hunger for material satisfaction 
without 
the 
emotional 
investment.
Whether or not she’s an actual 
witch we may never know, but her 
music is undeniably spellbinding, 
hypnotizing 
and 
addictively 
sexy. With “Daddy,” Tommy 
perfectly mixes all of the most 
attractive aspects of her music 
with precision and ease. With 
a self-titled debut album on the 
way, we’re left hoping she’s able 
to maintain her charm and power 
while remaining true to form.

Wolverines place 12th at Windy City Classic

Losses come in many ways. 
Sometimes your opponent beats 
you, sometimes you beat yourself 
and sometimes you’re just plain 
outmatched. On Monday and 
Tuesday at the Windy City 
Collegiate Classic outside of 
Chicago, the Michigan women’s 
golf team managed all three by 
placing 
12th 
of 
14 
teams 
amid 
fierce 
competition.
From 
the 
beginning, the 
Wolverines 
were 
fighting 
an 
uphill 
battle. 
Stiff 
competition 
filled the field 
that 
included 
four 
top-ten 
teams and no team ranked below 
No. 75.
Going into the meet wary of 
its chances of walking away with 
the victory, Michigan wanted 
to prove it could play with the 
best of the best and gain some 
exposure to elite competition 
ahead of the upcoming high 
stakes tournaments.
Early 
into 
the 
fledgling 
2018-19 season, it appeared the 
Wolverines were overmatched. 
But Michigan coach Jan Dowling 
tells a different story — one of 
failure to reach potential rather 
than David v. Goliath.
“I 
don’t 
think 
we 
were 
overmatched,” 
Dowling 
said. 
“If anything, we weren’t even 
close to full cylinders. I hope 
our team walks away feeling 
pretty confident about what our 
program can do and about our 
potential.
“In order to win the National 
Championships, you gotta be 
playing and winning against 
these teams, so I think by the 
time we get to the end of the 
year, we’re not intimidated by 
seeing these teams, and we know 
that if we clean things up and get 
a little bit better, than we can 
compete with them.”
Despite the elite play of its 
competition, 
the 
Wolverines 

beat themselves after falling 
behind in the second round. 
Shooting a combined 302 strokes 
on the first round of day one, 
they subsequently let the course 
slip away from them with a 307 
on their second time around.
Be it due to weather or mental 
adjustments, though, Michigan 
found its shot again and finished 
with a strong 299 total on the 
third round.
Leading 
the 
charge 
for 
the 
Wolverines 
was 
junior 
Hannah 
Ghelfi. 
Ghelfi
 
completed a career 
performance 
in 
which 
she 
set 
personal bests in 
individual 
finish 
(24th), 
single-
round total (72, 
E in first round) 
and 54-hole total 
(222).
“I think mostly my mental 
game (was my biggest strength), 
just getting comfortable, and 
this week, I think my putting 
was definitely a strength,” Ghelfi 
said. “I was having a lot of putts 
drop. I think I had five birdies 
my first round which is cool.”
Ghelfi, while not the most 
experienced 
Michigan 
golfer 
having to fight for her place in 

the lineup, has found herself 
thrust to the top of the pack due 
to an insatiable work ethic and 
improved 
mental 
toughness. 
After making her first start in 
late October of last year, Ghelfi
 
has only trended upward and 
doesn’t seem to be slowing down.
“It’s so cool to see,” Dowling 
said. “She’s a really hard worker, 
and has really improved a lot 
every season, and a lot of that can 
be accredited to 
her hard work. 
To 
have 
her 
come in here, 
and 
I 
think 
this 
was 
her 
lowest 
three 
rounds total of 
her career, and 
to do it in this 
field is pretty 
impressive, and 
the whole team 
is super excited 
for her.
“She’s a leader on our team, 
and 
just 
from 
a 
character 
perspective, she always works 
really hard, and to see her make 
the improvements that she has 
over the last two and half years 
is pretty awesome.”
Other 
Wolverines 
supplemented 
Ghelfi’s 
stellar 
outing with solid rounds of 
their own, including sophomore 

Ashley 
Kim’s 
Michigan-low 
73 in the third round. After 
consistently gaining and losing 
momentum 
throughout 
the 
tournament’s first and second 
rounds, Kim finally found her 
groove and sailed to her best 
round to close out the event.
“She really played well the 
first two days as well, but she had 
a couple holes that really killed 
her momentum,” Dowling said. 
“Then (Tuesday), 
same thing, she 
played 
well, 
then she had one 
double bogey on 
her 
11th 
hole, 
so 
that 
killed 
her 
momentum 
a little bit. So 
her scores don’t 
really reflect how 
well she played. 
Golf 
doesn’t 
really work that 
way, but if you can eliminate five 
holes, then she’s got a lot of really 
good positives to take away.”
In Kim’s case, she beat herself. 
In Ghelfi’s case, her opponent 
beat her. For the team itself, it 
was simply outmatched. As the 
Wolverines move on to the rest 
of their fall season, the goal is to 
limit mental mistakes and beat 
all opponents regardless of skill 
level.

Wolverines ready for a 
second course this year
A

s Mel Pearson sits down 
in a plush, blue Michigan 
armchair in Yost Ice 
Arena’s media room, something is 
hiding under 
his trademark 
calm 
demeanor.
Pearson 
was collected 
like that 
last year, no 
matter the ups 
and downs of 
his inaugural 
season as 
the coach 
of the Michigan hockey team. 
Back then, nobody thought the 
Wolverines would be within miles 
of where they are today — it was 
supposed to be a slow march back 
to respectability, a gradual rebuild 
in the shadow of the retired Red 
Berenson.
Understandably, Michigan 
was unranked following a 
13-win season the year before. 
Questions about whether or not 
forward Cooper Marody could 
stay healthy, if the front line could 
score consistently enough to keep 
the Wolverines competitive and 
just how long it would take for 
Michigan to return to prominence 
all loomed largely.
And yet, Pearson and the 
Wolverines defied all of those 
modest expectations, doubling 
their previous win total, catching 
fire mid-season, rallying from a 
disappointing start to the Frozen 
Four and being seconds away 
from playing for a title. More than 
anything, that Michigan team 
started a new era. It wasn’t Red’s 
former team anymore. It was — and 
is — Mel’s team.
“Last year, that was the 
appetizer,” Pearson said. “We got to 
the meal, we’ve got the appetizer, 
and we didn’t get a chance to finish 
the full course. Now, we’re still 
hungry. We want to sit down and 
make sure we have that full course 

— and eat it.”
Questions, though, remain 
abundant even for a team that had 
the season that Michigan did.
Who will step up to replace last 
year’s departed “Run DMC” line 
of forwards Dexter Dancs, Cooper 
Marody and Tony Calderone, and 
their combined 122 points?
How long will it take the ten 
freshmen on the team to adjust to 
college hockey?
Will there be regression back 
to the mean after last year’s 
improbable run?
Can they do it again?
“No college hockey team has 
played a game yet, so nothing really 
matters,” said junior forward Jake 
Slaker. “They can talk about last 
year as much as they want, but 
every team has new players and 
new identities on their team, so we 
just have to play the way we want 
to play.”
For Slaker, Pearson and the rest 
of the Wolverines, a clear-cut recipe 
to success has emerged: just as they 
formed a new identity and style 
regardless of the past, they must 
do the same this year to replace the 
seven departures from the team.
Michigan won’t be sneaking 
up on anyone anymore — the 
United States College Hockey Poll 
has them as the No. 4 team in the 
country, and there’s a year of film 
for opposing coaches to dissect.
Behind the calmness, it’s obvious 
that Pearson is excited to continue 
building on the success of last year. 
While last season was, by all means, 
a taste to remember, it would serve 
Michigan well to cleanse its palate, 
christening Yost’s ice this year 
with a fresh outlook, while still 
remembering the joys of last season 
in the back of its mind.
One might say the Wolverines 
are ready for what’s next on the 
menu.

Lavigne benefitting from starter’s confidence

Earning the job was the hard 
part. Keeping it? Well, that’s just 
a confidence booster for Hayden 
Lavigne.
The junior goaltender, this 
time last year, was fighting 
tooth-and-nail 
for 
playing 
time, competing practice after 
practice just to see who would 
start.
But this season is different. 
With the job firmly in his 
possession, Lavigne’s attention 
is elsewhere. He doesn’t have 
to worry about competing for 
playing time, but rather can 
focus on improving himself and 
preparing for upcoming games.
“It definitely kinda just adds 
a little bit of confidence and 
calmness to every day, coming in 
and knowing what I’m going to 
be doing is focusing on Saturday, 
and I know Saturday, I’m going 
to be starting in between the 
pipes,” Lavigne said. “So it’s just 
a little bit of confidence, little bit 
of calmness, plus I know I can 
worry about just getting ready 
for Saturday and not so much on 
out-competing each practice.
“Not 
that 
I 
don’t 
do 
that, 
but I don’t have 
to worry about 
earning my game 
time 
during 
practice, 
which 
allows me to work 
on a couple things 
I want to without 
hesitation 
of 
kinda not making 
saves 
that 
I 
should.”
For goaltenders, confidence 
is everything. The difference 
between a lucky, shaky goal can 
be as simple as thinking you can 
save it. And even if that random 
bounce happens and a goal 
occurs, the stability to know you 
won’t get pulled only helps.
“The goalies that question 
themselves, there’s a lot of 
times that there’ll be goals that 

go in that the confident goalies 
won’t let in,” Lavigne said. “The 
confidence just leads to not just 
your performance, but your 
team, your teammates really see 
that, especially in a game.
“You’re kind of the backbone 
being the last man back there, 
so I think being confident 
shows 
a 
lot; 
just kinda team 
momentum, 
your 
momentum, 
and it helps in 
preparation 
knowing 
that 
you’re confident 
about 
what 
you’re going to 
do.”
Lavigne’s 
confidence can be attributed to 
building momentum from last 
year, when Wolverines coach 
Mel Pearson named him the 
starter midway through the 
season. After former Michigan 
goaltender 
Jack 
LaFontaine 
allowed 
six 
goals 
against 
Bowling Green on Jan. 1, Lavigne 
was made the permanent starter 
and proved it was the right 
decision.

Though he ended the season 
with a middle-of-the-road .908 
save 
percentage, 
he 
strung 
together a series of stellar 
performances 
in 
high-profile 
games — averaging a .947 against 
Notre Dame, Penn State and 
Minnesota 
— 
while 
having 
clutch performances throughout 
the backend of the 
season, 
including 
a 
career-high 
48 
saves 
against 
Wisconsin.
And while that 
would 
sit 
well 
with most players, 
Lavigne is focused 
only on improving.
“This 
summer, 
I’ve been working 
on my patience,” 
Lavigne said. “I’ve been waiting 
for that shot to be released before 
I decide if I’m going down, if I’m 
going to move left or right, and I 
kind of noticed in practice when 
I noticed not to stay on my feet as 
long, not to be as patient, that’s 
when I get beat really easily.”
And though he worked on it 
during the summer, patience 
is an ongoing process. It’s not 
easy being patient. You can ask 

anyone, but Lavigne will tell you 
himself.
“Patience is a hard thing to 
kind of figure out, but that’s been 
my key thing so far,” Lavigne 
said. “So that was kind of my 
big thing over the summer that 
I worked on hard to fix and 
work on, obviously it’s an ever-
changing 
thing.”
And one of 
the 
biggest 
boosts to his 
confidence 
comes 
from 
the 
people 
standing 
in 
front 
of 
him 
— 
his 
defensemen.
Returning 
is one of the more talented 
groups of defensemen, one that 
Lavigne proclaimed no other 
team had. The communication 
between them is there. The 
trust is there. And inexplicably, 
the confidence between them is 
there as well.
So yes, it’s his job to lose, as 
Pearson likes to put it. And that’s 
enough to inspire confidence that 
Lavigne uses to elevate his game.

MEN’S SOCCER
‘M’ beats Oakland, 2-1, 
in final Big Ten tune-up

It was only a matter of time 
before the Michigan men’s 
soccer team broke through.
That moment came in the 
dying embers of the first 
half, as junior attacker Jack 
Hallahan made a marauding 
run into the penalty box. 
After gliding past a number of 
last-ditch tackles, an Oakland 
defender chopped Hallahan 
down in the box, and the 
Wolverines were awarded the 
penalty kick.
Sophomore 
midfielder 
Marc 
Ybarra 
stepped up to 
the 
spot 
and 
coolly 
slotted 
it past Golden 
Grizzlies’ 
goalkeeper 
Sullivan 
Lauderdale 
to 
open the scoring 
right 
before 
halftime.
The 
goal 
was a sign of things to come, 
as Michigan (8-1-1) would 
dispatch Oakland (5-4-2), 2-1.
Problematic 
field 
conditions translated into a 
sloppy opening 15 minutes 
from both sides. Once the 
Wolverines 
were 
able 
to 
gain a foothold, though, the 
Grizzlies couldn’t keep up.
“We still tried to play,” 
said Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley. “As the stats suggest, 
we 
dominated 
possession 
and dominated the quality 
chances. Sometimes having 
a lot of scoring opportunities 
doesn’t always mean getting 
the goals, but fortunately for 
us tonight it did.”
If the stats favored the 
Wolverines at the end of the 
first half, they definitely did in 
the second. From the whistle, 
Michigan 
played 
almost 
exclusively in Oakland’s half. 
Shot on goal after shot on goal, 
corner kick after corner kick, 

the 
Wolverines 
gradually 
wore their opponent down.
In the 58th minute, one of 
their 13 second-half shots was 
parried by Lauderdale right 
to the feet of senior striker 
Noah 
Kleedtke. 
Kleedtke, 
who has been filling in for 
injured sophomore goalscorer 
Mohammed Zakyi, one-timed 
the rebound into the net for 
what would be the game-
winning goal.
“Noah’s contribution this 
season has been tremendous,” 
Daley 
said. 
“He’s 
been 
committed and has stepped 
right in. I thought he deserved 
a 
goal 
from 
two, 
three, 
four 
games 
ago from all 
the hard work 
he’s 
been 
doing for the 
team.”
The Golden 
Grizzlies 
would pull a 
goal back late 
in the match, 
which made for a testy final 
five minutes. The Wolverines 
refused to allow all their hard 
work to go to waste, though, 
and took control of possession 
once again to close out the 
game with the ball at their 
feet.
This 
game 
marked 
Michigan’s final tune-up game 
before Big Ten juggernaut, 
No. 2 Indiana, comes to Ann 
Arbor on Sunday afternoon. 
The Wolverines, having won 
seven of their last eight, seem 
unfazed by the impending 
challenge.
“Indiana is a perennial 
powerhouse,” Daley said. “So 
we’ll have great perspective 
going into the game, but our 
guys are ready. We tied them 
down at Indiana, 1-1, last year, 
and I believe our group will be 
ready on Sunday. I certainly 
believe our guys are going to 
put their best foot forward 
and we’re gonna go for it.”

Ed Warinner explains strategy for coaching Michigan’s offensive line

Ed Warinner’s first year 
with the No. 15 Michigan 
football team (4-1 overall, 2-0 
Big Ten) didn’t get off to the 
best start. 
The offensive line coach’s 
unit was torn to shreds against 
Notre Dame to open the season 
on the field, but also off it, 
as the front five was widely 
blamed 
for 
the 
offense’s 
shortcomings.
The 
criticisms 
came 
from a few places. For one, 
the offensive line play was 
suspect in that game, and it 
was suspect last season as 
well. Additionally, Warinner 
brought with him a pedigree 
for producing NFL talent at 
places like Ohio State and with 
the Fighting Irish.
Since then, though, the line 
has improved drastically, albeit 
against 
worse 
competition. 
In fact, Saturday’s win over 
Northwestern 
might 
have 
been the Wolverine offensive 
line’s best game to this point, 
especially in pass protection. 
This season, they have given 
up just eight sacks this season. 
Through 
five 
games 
last 
season, Michigan had given up 
16 sacks. 
“That’s 
pretty 
good,” 
Warinner 
said. 
“We’re 
trying 
to improve that 
area. 
We’ve 
simplified 
our 
protections, 
and 
our 
guys 
are getting real 
comfortable 
with them.
“… 
I 
think 
it’s 
just 
consistency 
in 
their 
technique 
and 
then 
understanding the protections 
and then not changing them on 
them.”
Those things are what is 
always brought up when asking 
about the offensive line. 

It seems every player or 
coach, when asked about the hog 
mollies up front, mentions the 
importance of communication 
and technique and consistent 
play. 
Those 
same 
things are true 
with 
many 
positions, 
but 
especially with 
offensive 
line 
play, there isn’t 
much more to 
be said, because 
there 
aren’t 
many 
stats 
that 
properly 
quantify how well an offensive 
line is playing. 
Despite the slow start, the 
Wolverines’ front has passed 
the eye test in the past four 
weeks. That’s something that 
wasn’t true very often last 

season without Warinner. 
To Warinner, it’s a product 
of the things mentioned above, 
but it’s also due to the dogged 
pace and perfectionism he has 
tried to instill in 
the unit.
“You just gotta 
push 
people, 
make 
them 
uncomfortable, 
you gotta make 
them 
do 
stuff 
they really don’t 
want 
to 
do,” 
Warinner 
said. 
“That 
comes 
with trust. So, 
they have to trust that what 
you’re doing and what you’re 
telling them will make them be 
a better player, make the team 
be a better team. So you develop 
trust, then you push them to 
challenge them to do more than 

they’ve done in the past, do 
it better than they’ve done in 
the past. And you hold people 
accountable. 
“… I just think that until 
something 
you 
tell them shows 
on film, where 
they 
can 
see 
themselves 
doing 
that 
against our team 
or 
somebody 
else, that’s when 
it really becomes 
reinforced. Like, 
‘I haven’t given 
up a sack this 
year. These pass protection 
drills — cause we didn’t do 
these drills last year. Or I never 
did these things.’ ”
Another thing that Warinner 
was said to have helped with 
this offseason was simplifying 

the play calls for the offensive 
line in an effort to help with 
understanding and, as a result, 
speed.
That, too, is hard to see as a 
casual observer, 
but 
Warinner 
explained it in 
simpler 
terms, 
saying on each 
play, 
he 
gives 
his 
offensive 
linemen 
two 
options to limit 
thinking. 
And 
if 
the 
defense 
forces 
a 
third 
option, 
it’s 
on Warinner to adjust the 
gameplan.
“That’s how I envision it,” 
Warinner 
said. 
“Cause 
the 
more you put in there, the 
slower they play. And the less 
confident they are. ‘What if he 

does that?’ You know. You get 
that question a lot. So I love to 
tell them, ‘Don’t worry about 
that. That’s on me. You worry 
about this stuff.’ Know what I 
mean? That’s my job. And then 
make adjustments. 
“And if something happens 
that we’re not prepared for, 
nobody’s 
getting 
yelled 
at. 
There’s no stress, it’s just, ‘Hey, 
this is the answer.’ We have 
tools in our toolbox to fix all 
problems, but you can only 
have two tools in your hands at 
once. One in this hand and one 
in that hand. Here we go. You 
can’t have more than that. So, 
we need a new tool, we get the 
new tool out, next series, here 
we go.”
As is always the case with 
the 
offensive 
line, 
or 
the 
Wolverines as a whole, it is 
worth noting that they still 
have to prove they can stand up 
against a defensive front like 
Wisconsin’s, Michigan State’s, 
Penn State’s or Ohio State’s. 
Those tests will come soon 
enough. For now, though, the 
improvement 
is 
all 
anyone 
could ask for. Michigan was 
supposed to play well against its 
last four opponents, and while 
this last weekend was a closer 
game than many expected, 
the offensive line wasn’t the 
reason. 
If 
you 
had 
read 
that 
sentence 
four 
weeks ago, you 
would have been 
shocked. 
“The 
narrative 
has 
been 
going 
in 
ever since I’ve 
been here that 
the 
Michigan 
offensive 
line 
hasn’t been up to the standards 
that people outside this building 
would like,” said redshirt junior 
tackle Jon Runyan Jr. “We take 
that personally, and we’ve been 
trying to (change that) every 
day.”

Don Brown sees ‘maturity’ in defense

The 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 
defense 
couldn’t 
have 
started 
much 
worse 
last 
Saturday. 
Heavily 
favored in a de facto neutral-
site 
game, 
the 
Wolverines 
allowed touchdowns on two 
of 
Northwestern’s 
opening 
three 
drives, 
as 
penalties, 
missed tackles and a locked-
in 
quarterback 
dismantled 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown’s group early.
It was their second poor start 
this year. In the season-opener, 
Michigan spotted Notre Dame 
three first-half touchdowns.
But in both games, Brown’s 
group adjusted. His defense 
had little room for error last 
Saturday after falling into a 
17-0 hole, and it responded 
accordingly. After the first 
quarter, the Wolverines allowed 
just 119 yards of total offense 
and prevented Northwestern 
from scoring after the 12:56 
mark in the second quarter.
And 
though 
Michigan 
couldn’t complete the comeback 
in early September, its defense 
gave it a chance — the Fighting 
Irish only scored a field goal in 
the second half.
Despite 
his 
perpetual 
expectation 
of 
near 
perfectionism, 
those 
turnarounds 
have 
Brown 
encouraged. 
“I’m also going to tell you 
this: A year ago if the wheels 
came off, the wheels were off,” 
Brown said during Wednesday’s 
press conference. “This group 
has the ability to have wheels 
off, (then put the) wheels back 
on. I think that’s a little bit 
of a sign of the maturity of 
this group and the quality of 
the character our guys have. 
There’s no doubt about that.”
Michigan’s defense — despite 
finishing 
with 
a 
top-three 
ranking nationally — indeed 
had boom-or-bust tendencies 
in 2017, unraveling in losses to 
Penn State and South Carolina.
This season, however, the 
Wolverines 
have 
showed 
resilience, which has helped 

them allow the fewest yards in 
the country, averaging 4.1 yards 
per play.
But that doesn’t mean it’s all 
roses for Brown and company.
Michigan 
has 
struggled 
with penalties all season, with 
an average 9.2 calls accepted 
per 
game. 
The 
secondary, 
especially, has been targeted 
— though that’s partially a 
byproduct of Brown’s man-to-
man scheme.
Junior cornerbacks Lavert 
Hill and David Long were 
caught 
with 
holding 
and 
pass 
interference 
penalties, 
respectively, 
during 
critical 
moments of both Northwestern 
touchdown 
drives. 
Junior 
VIPER Khaleke Hudson and 
junior safety Josh Metellus, 
meanwhile, have missed parts 
of games due to suspensions 
after targeting penalties.
That’s 
caused 
Brown 
to 
adjust how he teaches tackling.
“I’ve never had to transition 
due 
to 
how 
things 
are 
officiated,” Brown said. “I don’t 
recall that ever in my coaching 
career that happening, but now 
I feel that happening. It’s a 
tough deal but, you know, (you) 
get it done.”
Frustration lies in what isn’t 
being called, too.
Fifth-year senior defensive 
end Chase Winovich said he was 
“baffled” by the lack of holding 
calls 
against 
the 
Wildcats’ 
offensive 
line 
Saturday 
— 

something that’s also bothered 
Brown.
“You know what’s shocking 
to me? We’ve played two Big 
Ten games, we have 10 sacks 
and 24 TFLs, but we don’t get 
held,” Brown said. “Take a look 
and compare to the other teams 
around our league. That one is a 
little tough.”
Brown is also annoyed with 
the wide-spread criticism his 
players 
have 
received 
over 
social media. Sunday morning, 
Long tweeted, “If you’ve never 
played man to man please 
refrain from making comments 
about secondary play.”
Brown would rather you take 
up your concerns with him.
“Be critical of the old guy. 
Don’t be critical of the players, 
now,” 
Brown 
said. 
“That’s 
crossing the line, in my opinion. 
I guess that could be a topic we 
could stand here and argue. 
All they do is do what they’re 
asked.”
Despite 
the 
poor 
start, 
Michigan’s defense did just that 
Saturday. In the halftime locker 
room, Brown told his players 
that they’d need to pitch a 
shutout to win. The Wolverines 
did as they were asked, saving 
their season in the process.
“I thought that was a good 
test for us,” Brown said. “Every 
experience you go through 
… you’re looking to build on. 
We (knew) how to handle this 
situation.”
