After 
President 
Donald 

Trump 
signed 
an 
executive 

order last week to reverse carbon 
emission regulations on coal-
fired power plants enacted by 
former President Barack Obama, 
members of the University of 
Michigan community reacted, on 
the whole, with criticism.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said University leaders 
are working to understand the 
full implications of Trump’s order, 
and are still working toward a 25 
percent decrease in greenhouse 
emissions.

“As we work to understand 

the implications of the executive 
order, sustainability remains an 
important topic for our university 
community,” 
Fitzgerald 
said. 

“We’ve invested significantly in 
this area, and are in the process 
of implementing key efforts to 
increase progress toward our goal 
to reduce carbon emissions by 25 
percent by the year 2025.”

Engineering 
Prof. 
Richard 

Rood teaches a class on climate 

change, and said he considers the 
regulation rollback to be harmful 
and will degrade progress made 
to reduce carbon emissions under 
Obama.

“Many climate scientists find it 

hurtful and also a very backward 
stepping political position,” Rood 
said.

Rood 
said 
he 
considers 

Trump’s actions to be a strong 
political statement to the coal 
industry, but said he ultimately 
believes the bringing back coal 
jobs — one of Trump’s campaign 
promises — will not happen 
because of the economy moving 
toward alternate forms of energy.

“From my point of view, its 

position that it will reinstate coal 
jobs is not something that’s going 
to happen, that’s driven more by 
economics,” Rood said. “In that 
regard, I think it (the executive 
order) is hollow.”

Ross also said he believes 

Obama’s 
executive 
orders 

accelerated the development of 
renewable energy sources, but 
the United States could now be 
at a disadvantage with Trump’s 
reversal of the order.

“I think what it does is it takes 

Chants of “Free the Weed!” 

could be heard and cannabis 
flags were raised high on the 
Diag on Saturday afternoon 
as an estimated 6,000 people 
gathered to participate in the 
46th annual Hash Bash. Leading 
activists, medical researchers, 
community leaders and citizens 
spoke on behalf of the support 
and legalization of marijuana 
consumption, followed by live 
music.

One 
of 
the 
speakers 
at 

the 
event 
was 
30-year-old 

Zahra Abbas, a University of 
Michigan-Dearborn 
student 

who, after being prescribed 
medical 
marijuana 
for 
her 

severe 
epilepsy, 
has 
been 

seizure free for almost two 
years. Abbas left the University 
three years ago because of her 
medical condition, but said she 
was able to return to her studies 
this past fall because of medical 
marijuana.

“I was never seizure free 

without the cannabis,” Abbas 
said. “The most I made it 
seizure free before was three 
months and that was right after 
brain surgery. Without brain 
surgery, I would only make it 
a week or something at a time, 
and that would be a good week, 
but on the 13th, it’ll be two years 
seizure free.”

Abbas said, as a student, 

she has been met with an 

overwhelming 
amount 
of 

support 
from 
faculty 
and 

students who support the use of 
medical marijuana.

“I even had one teacher that, 

he was really happy about it,” 
she said. “He was a psychology 
teacher and his wife used it.”

Richie 
“Free 
the 
Weed” 

Clement, the legislative assistant 
to Detroit City Councilmember 
George Cushingberry Jr. (D–
District 2), spoke at the event, 

urging 
people 
to 
vote 
for 

representatives who support the 
legalization of recreational and 
medical marijuana usage. 

“If you don’t support weed, 

you’re not the one we need!” 
Clement chanted.

Clement 
discussed 

the 
significant 
amount 
of 

misunderstanding 
he 
feels 

surrounds the plant and the 
implications of its consumption.

“F—k the box, think outside 

the box,” Clement said. “It’s 
time that people wake up and 
put to rest all the lies that’ve 
been told about the plant, it’s 
time to get away from this 1939 
bullshit mentality.”

CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

DETROIT — For the seniors, 

for a banner and to prove the 
NCAA 
selection 
committee 

wrong — these three reasons 
urged the Michigan women’s 
basketball team forward during 
its postseason appearances.

It’s for those three reasons 

that the Wolverines, led by 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico, battled Kent State, Wright 
State, St. John’s, Virginia Tech 
and Villanova to get to Saturday’s 
contest against Georgia Tech. 

And, most importantly, it’s 

for those three reasons that 
Michigan is going to get to hang 
its first banner in Crisler Center, 
after 
defeating 
the 
Yellow 

Jackets in triple overtime, 89-79. 
It was the first time in history 
that a WNIT final went into 
even a single overtime.

“Our mood was ‘We have 

another quarter,’ ” said senior 
guard Siera Thompson. “They 
keep giving us another chance 
to win this game and we never 
had any doubt in our mind. We 
kept fighting, we came this far, 

and we weren’t gonna lose this 
game.” 

The Wolverines (28-9 overall) 

hosted Georgia Tech (22-15) 
at Detroit Mercy in Calihan 
Hall on Saturday. The last 
time Michigan and the Yellow 
Jackets met was on Dec. 1 for the 
Big Ten/ACC Challenge, where 
the Wolverines broke away with 
a 92-52 victory. But, like Barnes 
Arico warned after the Villanova 
game on March 29, this would be 
a completely different team.

With nine seconds left in 

the game, the Wolverines were 
down by three. Junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty, though, had 
the ball, took a deep three and 
made the shot. It was tied at 67 
with 9.6 seconds left. 

“I took the shot,” Flaherty 

said. “I knew we didn’t have 
much time left. I figured it was 
the best shot to take and it just 
happened to go in.”

Georgia Tech still had a 

chance to claim victory, and with 
0.6 seconds left in the game, a 
foul was called on Michigan. An 

excruciating minute later —in 
which the referees reviewed the 
play — it became clear that the 
game was going to be decided 
by a pair of free throws. But 
the 
Yellow 
Jackets 
couldn’t 

capitalize and went 0-for-2, 
sending the game to its first 
overtime. 

Five minutes were put on the 

clock, and sophomore center 
Hallie Thome beat out Georgia 
Tech’s center in the tip-off, 
leading to a personal layup not 
long after. Williams then went 
1-for-2 on free throws, pushing 
Michigan ahead, 70-67. 

With a minute to go, the 

Yellow Jackets hit their own 
three. Again, the game was 
tied. Thompson took the ball 
downcourt, and a timeout was 
called with 10.9 seconds left to 
go, but Michigan couldn’t put 
the game to bed.

The Wolverines went into 

their second overtime. It was 
76-74 with 14.1 on the clock, 
and a Georgia Tech player broke 
away for a layup, leaving senior 

guard Danielle Williams on the 
floor and the Wolverines with 
possession. Michigan couldn’t 
take the game, though, and — 
once again — it was pushed into 
its third overtime. 

This time, sophomore guard 

Jillian 
Dunston 
predicted 

her team would win by 10 — a 
prediction that pushed the team 
through.

“We 
knew 
this 
was 
it,” 

Flaherty 
said. 
“We 
were 

running out of gas. We knew 
they were tired. We just pushed 
through. 
(Dunston 
said 
it) 

at the beginning of the third 
overtime. It happened, and we 
just believed her.”

After four points by Thome 

and two apiece for Flaherty 
and Munger, the game had 
19.5 seconds left and Michigan 
was sitting with a 10-point 
advantage. 

Barnes Arico threw a thumbs 

up to the crowd, the clock 
wound down and Michigan had 
a championship victory on its 
resume.

As part of its eighth annual 

Marshall 
M. 
Weinberg 

Symposium on Saturday, the 
Weinberg Institute for Cognitive 
Science hosted Noam Chomsky, 
an 
MIT 
professor, 
linguist 

and 
cognitive 
scientist. 
The 

interdisciplinary symposium titled 
“The Architecture and Evolution 
of the Human Language Capacity” 

showcased speakers from the 
fields of philosophy, psychology, 
linguistics and cognitive science. 

The event itself appealed to 

people from many backgrounds, 
including 
Naila 
Ashraf, 
a 

University of Michigan alum.

“I’m not a linguist,” she said. 

“I don’t know anything about 
cognitive science. I came to see 
him because he’s a living legend. 
I am really interested about his 
political activism and his critique 
of American democracy as well as 

global political systems.”

Chomsky’s 
presentation 

centered 
on 
the 
Galilean 

Challenge, where Galileo urged 
linguists to show how just a few 
sounds can construct “an infinite 
variety of expressions (that) reveal 
all the secrets of the mind.”

University alum Mahela Ashraf 

questioned the challenge’s premise 
of infinite language. 

“Isn’t there going to be a point 

at which you come to a realization 
that everything meaningful that 
had to be said will have been said 
by 2050, and from then on, you 
are only trying to interpret those 
really original thoughts?”

Chomsky explained how he 

has addressed this aim and how 
the challenge itself has evolved, 
asserting the challenge had not 
been taken up until the mid-20th 
century because the intellectual 
tools were not available. However, 
mathematicians have established 
a theory of computability, which 
illustrates how our brains can 
generate infinite variations of 
expressions.

In doing so, mathematicians 

have made possible the “basic 
property” of human language — 
the ability to digitally build an 
infinite amount of structured 
expressions, 
which 
can 
be 

interpreted into a thought and 
externalized. The product of this 
is what he calls “the language 
of thought,” or the system of 
thoughts that, when externalized, 
can be used for communication. 

“The language faculty of the 

human brain provides the means 
to construct a digitally infinite 
array of hierarchically structured 
expressions,” he said. “Each of 
which is semantically interpreted 
as expressing thought, and each 
of which can be, and sometimes 
is, externalized in one or another 
sensory modality.”

However, Chomsky believes 

internal language is used more 
than external language. Internal 
language refers to the linguistic 
knowledge inside the mind of 
the speaker; therefore, external 
language is only internal language

Ann Arbor residents and 

Detroiters alike worked together for 

the University of Michigan’s largest 

day of service learning this past 

weekend, as over 900 University 

students traveled to the city for a series 

of volunteer projects centered around 

clean-up and farming. 

The event was organized by The 

Detroit Partnership, a student-run 

nonprofit aiming to unite Ann Arbor 

residents and Detroiters. This year 

marked the 17th annual day of service 

connecting students to volunteer sites 

across the city.

“Volunteers participate in various 

hands-on projects throughout the city 

of Detroit, from urban gardening, to 

clean up and demolition with a focus 

on community revitalization,” the 

organization’s website reads.

Twenty-one service sites from 

around the city participated in DP Day. 

At each site, Community Coordinators 

helped to run volunteer projects and 

lead reflections at the end of the day, 

with assistance from student site 

leaders.

This year, University students 

also partnered with volunteers from 

University of Detroit Mercy, Wayne 

State University and UM-Dearborn.

LSA sophomore Myka Yamasaki is 

a member of the education team of The 

Detroit Partnership. She participated 

in the day herself, volunteering at 

Greydale Farm in the Brightmoor 

neighborhood.

“It’s an urban farm, so we did 

mostly a lot of trash pickup,” she said. 

“A lot of people were helping create 

dirt piles that will be used to help 

grow produce.”

Yamasaki said she and other 

student participants felt they were 

really making a difference through DP 

Day, and were glad they could offer 

real assistance to the farm’s owner.

“The woman who owns the farm 

… said she was really happy we were 

there,” Yamasaki said. “She said that 

the amount of trash pickup on the 

farm and in the surrounding area, 

and the woodchip and leaf litter piles, 

would’ve taken her three months to do 

on her own. It was pretty good to hear 

that we could actually do something 

helpful for them, instead of them just 

feeling like they’re hosting us.”

The stated goal of the day was to 

involve students in the city and begin 

to build a connection, and Yamasaki 

said she saw students becoming more 

invested. She said there was a lot of 

interest in The Detroit Partnership’s 

weekly volunteer programs, which 

connect students to the city 

throughout the school year.

“People were really willing to ask 

me questions about what (else) Detroit 

Partnership does besides DP Day … 

which is really cool, because that’s 

something we want to encourage,” she 

said. “It’s not just one day, volunteering 

and forming a partnership with 

Detroit, so it’s really great to see.”

also spoke about the merits of 
petitioning the government.

“We’re the ones with the 

petition for the legalization of 
recreational marijuana here in 
the state of Michigan,” Spencer 
said.

An couple from Novi, Mich., 

who 
requested 
to 
remain 

anonymous because they were 
talking about drug use, outlined 
the routine for their celebration. 

“We smoked before, in the 

mosh pit, walking out of the 
mosh pit,” they said.

One of the two, a prospective 

student, talked about how Hash 
Bash makes her feel about the 
University.

“I 
was 
going 
to 
apply 

anyways, but this is just an 
added bonus, I guess,” she said. 
“The atmosphere was pretty 
cool because everybody was 
doing the same thing.”

Chris Zane of Washington, 

Mich. said he hopes Michigan 
will 
legalize 
weed 
for 

recreational use, and added that 
Hash Bash offered him a chance 
to spend time “just chilling with 
my buddies, smoking.”

Patrons 
of 
Hash 
Bash 

included 
people 
who 
were 

involved with the cause to 

various 
degrees. 
Another 

woman, 
who 
requested 
to 

remain anonymous, was in Ann 
Arbor for her first Hash Bash.

“We’ve been growing for the 

last three years and we kind of 
wanted to see what it was about 
and, honestly, it’s not what I 
thought it was,” she said.

She attested to the broad 

scope of patrons in attendance.

“I mean it’s actually super 

controlled 
and 
I’m 
really 

surprised there’s actually a 
plethora of people here,” the 
woman said. “Honestly, I was 
surprised to see some older 
people here and it’s kind of nice

inspires 
you 
to 
continue 

participating 
in 
discussion 

surrounding 
gender-based 

violence,” Dunbeck said.

More than 30 works were 

displayed, including drawings, 
poems and film. Participants 
and 
attendees 
agreed 
that 

regardless of the art form, the 
entire display was extremely 
impactful.

LSA junior Yaya Sun said the 

event was more empowering 
than she expected, especially as 
it was her first year attending. 

“I really think it is a great 

way for survivors to get their 
message out,” she said. “It’s an 
opportunity to have a safe space 
that they can explore their 
message through art. Art is a 
really good way of expressing 
your emotions that you can’t 
normally say. I think my favorite 
piece was Sam Kennedy’s ... it 
was very relatable.”

The work Sun referred to is 

“Boys Talk About Me,” which 
Kennedy, an LSA sophomore, 
described as “a collage of stupid 
things boys have said to or about 
me.” The collection includes 
tweets, texts and other posts 
of degrading statements about 
Kennedy, many of them sexist 
and, at times, explicitly violent.

Many other similar pieces 

expressed sometimes shocking 
stories and occurrences, or 
hopes for a better understanding 
of sexuality- and gender-related 
sexual matters.

In a multi-paneled layout 

titled “When You Get It,” LSA 
junior Maeve Pascoe placed a 
drawing of a girl alongside the 
words “just going through an 
endometrial shift.”

“As I sat in the laundry room 

of East Quad making this piece, 
a male student looked over as 
he was loading his laundry and 
remarked that he was impressed 
by my art,” Pascoe wrote. “He 
asked what the words meant. I 
explained, and he became silent. 
… It’s not something most people 

are proud of. In fact, most women 
view it as a burden to bear. But 
why would it be a burden? Should 
our lives be a burden? It’s a natural 
part of life. Embrace it or not, it 
happens, and it’s something I’ve 
come to peace with. After all, it’s 
just a shift.”

A film played behind the art 

displays, which was an original 
creation by LSA freshman Shreya 
Patel for a class project.

“My first attempt at tackling 

this 
concept 
took 
a 
subtle 

approach using poetry as the 
audio component and abstract 
cultural patterns for visuals,” 
Patel said. “I decided to try and 
make a video that attempts at a 
resolution to the biggest area of 
neglect within my life.”

Many 
SAPAC 
volunteers 

expressed that they wanted 
the event to be focused on 
empowerment for individuals 
affected by sexual and gender 
violence, sexism and other 
related issues.

“I wanted to tackle my fear of 

coming out about sexual abuse,” 
Patel finished.

the federal government out of 
the 
important 
technological 

and economic benefits that we 
would realize from accelerating 
renewable energy as well as our 
participation in global markets,” 
Rood said. “Countries like China 
and Germany and other large 
economies will keep going on 
with technological innovation in 
addressing climate change, so it 
isolates us in that way.”

Conversely, 
LSA 
junior 

Enrique Zalamea, the chair of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans chair, said he favors 
Trump’s executive orders, and 
believes less regulation is key to the 
United States’s competitiveness in 
the global market.

“Global climate change is a 

universal issue; shouldering the 
burden of restrictive climate 
change regulations should not fall 
on countries like the U.S., while 
free-rider countries like India 
and China continue to increase 

their (carbon dioxide) emissions, 
and with it their GDP,” Zalamea 
said. “We need to become more 
competitive in the global market, 
and one way to get there is 
through less regulations from the 
EPA.”

In the long-term, Zalamea 

said, he wants to see the move 
to more efficient alternative 
energy sources and currently 
favors a plan proposed by 
conservatives that would roll 
back EPA regulations while also 
instituting a carbon dioxide 
emissions tax to slowly shift to 
cleaner energy.

“I do hope that one day we can 

transition into more affordable 
and efficient alternate energy 
sources such as solar power or 
nuclear energy,” Zalamea said. 
“One of the ways we can make this 
big transition is through the zero-
sum carbon tax plan, proposed 
just a few months ago by a group 
of Republican congressmen.”

Contrary to Zalamea, LSA 

junior Rowan Conybeare, the 
chair of the University’s chapter 
of College Democrats, said she 
believes 
Trump’s 
executive 

order is “backwards” and will 
have a negative impact on the 
climate and air quality.

“Trump’s executive action 

to roll back climate regulations 
is 
incredibly 
dangerous; 
it 

will negatively impact the air 
quality in every state, including 
Michigan,” 
Conybeare 
said. 

“We, as a state, have some of the 
most precious natural resources 
in the world — our state, and 
the livelihood of millions of 
people, are in danger because of 
Trump’s actions on climate.”

Conybeare also said she 

believes Trump’s order will not 
succeed in creating jobs since 
it does not focus on long-term 
renewable energy.

“Fortune 
reported 
earlier 

this year that renewable energy 
is creating jobs 12 times faster 
than the rest of the economy,” 
Conybeare 
said. 
“Trump’s 

executive order isn’t about 
boosting the economy — it’s 
about 
denying 
the 
impact 

and 
existence 
of 
climate 

change in favor of appeasing 
large 
corporations 
and 

manufacturers.”

made audible.

He stated languages seem very 

complex, and this view was held 
by professional linguists just 60 
years ago. However, a new program 
called the Biolinguistic Program has 
shown how languages, in reality, are 
consistent from one to another. He 
briefly discussed the importance 
of biology in his work by hinting at 
some of his most familiar discoveries 
— language acquisition devices.

“At peak periods of language 

acquisition, children are acquiring 
about a word an hour, that is, often on 
one presentation,” Chomsky said. “It 
must be, then, that the rich meaning 
of even the most elementary words 

is substantially innate.”

He 
continued 
by 
saying 

linguistics, 
in 
particular, 
faces 

difficulty with Galileo’s objective 
because it must account for evolution. 
He asserted the language faculty 
emerged with modern humans, but 
not too much information is known 
about the evolution of modern 
humans. This, in Chomsky’s mind, 
complicates the primary goal of the 
Galilean Challenge — to determine 
the genetic structures that allow for 
language.

Chomsky, also a renowned social 

critic and political activist, was 
asked by an audience member what 
could be done to turn the United 
States around from its current 
state. He urged listeners to do 
anything to speak out, asserting the 
United States is still a free society 

with many opportunities to have 
individual voices heard. He also 
concluded that there is popular 
base of people capable of enacting 
serious changes to the current 
governmental practices. One of 
the necessary changes, Chomsky 
argued, is campaign finance.

“For 
well 
over 
a 
century, 

elections in the United States have 
been essentially bought,” he said. 
“You can pretty well predict the 
electability simply on the basis of 
campaign funding.”

LSA senior Anthony Quail shared 

Chomsky’s hopes for uniting and 
mobilizing the public.

“In the present climate, it’s easy 

to forget that change starts with 
individual actions,” he said. “We 
cannot allow ourselves to feel 
powerless.”

“It was a long battle through 

the year, but at the end we’re 
on top and that’s what’s good,” 
Thompson said, who currently 
holds three program records 
for games played (41), minutes 
played (4,776) and total assists 
(545). She played for the 
entirety of the game. 

The game started as tense 

and hectic as the ending. 
Within 34 seconds, Thome 
committed her first personal 
foul, ensuring the first two 
points on the board were from 
Georgia Tech’s forward Zaire 
O’Neil in a pair of free throws.

It was fitting that the 

Wolverines’ two seniors made 
the team’s first five points 
of the game, with Williams’ 
classmate, Thompson joining 
her on the statsheet with 
a field goal after Williams 
converted from beyond the 
arc.

It was sophomore guard 

Nicole Munger who pushed 
the Wolverines ahead of the 
Yellow Jackets for the first 
time with a 3-pointer that 
made the game 15-14 with 
just over a minute left of 
play in the first — a scoreline 
that 
remained 
unchanged 

going into the second period. 
Michigan was winning despite 
shooting just 27 percent from 
the floor.

In a media timeout with 

4:44 left to go in the second 
quarter, each team totaled 
four fouls and Michigan was 
down by four. Notably, up to 
this point, Flaherty had only 
posted a pair of free throws.

In true Flaherty fashion, 

though, 
this 
slump 
didn’t 

last for long. After going 
0-for-7 in field goals and 0-4 
in 3-pointers, Flaherty hit 
a layup and a 3-pointer to 
push the score in favor of the 
Wolverines. After taking a hit 
in the face during a frenzy dive 
for the basketball — something 
the referees didn’t make a call 
on — Flaherty got called for 
her own foul downcourt on the 
same player, Georgia Tech’s 
O’Neil. 

The 
game 
got 
uglier, 

another foul got called on 
Georgia Tech and Thome 
converted in the bonus to 
leave the score at 28-25. Going 
into 
halftime, 
the 
Yellow 

Jackets had made a pair of 
free throws, making it a one-
point game. 

The first major advantage 

of the game — a lead over 
four points — went to the 
Wolverines after a field goal 
from 
junior 
guard 
Jillian 

Dunston. Another two-point 
field goal from Thome had 
Michigan in a 38-33 position 
in the third quarter. 

The 
Wolverines 
lost 

that 
edge, 
though, 
with 

around a minute left to go 
in the third period when the 
Yellow Jackets tied it at 40. 
With a defensive rebound, 
Georgia Tech was able to 
bring it down court for a 
layup with no Wolverine to 
defend them. Another foul on 
Georgia Tech’s O’Neil gave 
Flaherty a chance to make 
three 
free 
throws. 
Going 

3-for-3, Flaherty brought her 
teammates into the fourth 
period leading, 43-42. 

The game wound down in 

a back and forth affair, and 
with roughly five minutes to 
go in the game, Barnes Arico 
called a time out with her 
team trailing by four. The 
Wolverines were in a hole, but 
a shallow one. The crowd’s 
roar overtook the stadium, 
deafening 
the 
arena. 
The 

championship 
victory 
was 

still possible. 

From there, the Wolverines 

managed to push the game to 
three overtimes.

“We wore the other team 

down,” Barnes Arico said. 

 And the rest — as Michigan’s 

future banner will tell — is 
Crisler Center history.

workforce,” Andrasko said. “Lean 
In is all about creating an open 
dialogue and trying to talk about 
issues that are sort of brushed under 
the rug, so we wanted to bring in 
influential speakers to talk about 
intersectionality and diversity.”

In her speech, Congresswoman 

Dingell 
emphasized 
how 

important it is for women to 
support one another, saying her 

network of women was an integral 
contributor to her own political 
successes politically. 

“Trust me when I tell you 

the 
importance 
of 
building 

relationships with your female 
peers,” Dingell said. “I’ve been 
where you are, I’ve been in your 
shoes. As women, we are all on the 
same team. We need to lift each 
other up, we need to celebrate one 
another’s successes.”

She 
also 
brought 
up 
the 

difficulties of balancing different 
aspects of her life, as childcare 

and personal relationships are still 
more of an issue for women in the 
workplace than they are for men. 
Dingell said while it was difficult 
having to respond to sexism, she 
did not allow it to discourage her 
and instead focused on proving 
those who doubted her wrong.

“You have a lot of the same 

problems that I did, which is how to 
get the door open,” Dingell said.

F

or the past seven years, 
a specter has been 
haunting my classes.

I have been teaching classes 

on United States political and 
social movement history and on 
the history of race in the U.S. 
at the University of Michigan 
since the mid-1990s. Sometime 
around 2010, I noticed a change 
in my classrooms. My classes, 
I came to realize, had been 
profoundly altered by Proposal 
2, the statewide referendum 
that in 2006 banned the use of 
affirmative action in college 
admissions in Michigan.

It was not so much that there 

were fewer Black, Latinx and 
Native 
American 
students. 

There probably was a slight 
decline, but I had taught classes 
that were all-white or nearly 
all-white before. Nor was there 
a significant change in the 
political viewpoints expressed 
by students.

The change was less tangible 

and at times felt difficult to put 
a finger on. Gradually, I began to 
realize that the students of color 
in my classes had become less 
vocal, less assertive. When they 
did talk about their experiences 
at the University, I sensed that 
they 
felt 
significantly 
more 

isolated 
within 
the 
campus 

community than had previous 
generations of my students. As a 
result, they seemed less willing 
to engage white students in 
discussions about racial justice.

But it was the difference in the 

white students in my classes that 
was even more striking to me. 
They clearly had less experience 
interacting with students of 
color than previous generations 
of white students and less of 
a sense of how the University 
experience was different for 
students of color than it was for 
members of the white majority.

With 
students 
of 
color 

making up a smaller proportion 
of 
the 
University’s 
student 

community, students of every 

race and ethnicity came into 
my 
classroom 
with 
fewer 

cross-racial 
experiences 
and 

therefore with less confidence 
in their ability to honestly 
discuss the complexities of U.S. 
race relations in a mixed racial 
setting. Increasingly, I came 
to feel that my classes were 
haunted by the ghosts of the 
students of color who were no 
longer able or willing to enroll at 
the University because of Prop. 
2. Without the voices of these 
missing students, the quality 
of learning in my courses on 
the U.S. racial experience was 
fundamentally compromised.

For the University bicentennial 

exhibit 
titled 
“Remembering 

Students Missing After Proposal 
2,” I have estimated that, in the 
decade since voters approved 
Prop. 2 in November 2006, at 
least 1,102 Black, Latinx and 
Native American undergraduate 
students were either unable 
or chose not to enroll at the 
University. I arrived at this 
estimate 
by 
comparing 
the 

number 
of 
underrepresented 

minority freshman who enrolled 
in the University between 2007 
and 2016 with the number who 
would have enrolled in those 
years if the University had been 
able to maintain the percentage 
of underrepresented students 
who were enrolled in 2006. (You 
can read about how I made this 
calculation on the bicentennial 
exhibit’s website.) It is the 
specter of the missing 1,102 
unenrolled students of color that 
haunts my classroom.

In 
an 
undergraduate 

population of nearly 30,000 
students, the loss of just more 
than 100 students of color 
per graduating class wouldn’t 
seem to have such a dramatic 
impact. In fact, according to 
the Office of the Registrar’s 
enrollment reports, the number 
of URM undergraduates was, 
at its low point in 2014, only 
11 percent lower than it had 

been before Prop. 2 went into 
effect. Still, the loss of these 
students 
has 
fundamentally 

remade the campus climate and 
educational environment.

Why did the loss of this 

relatively 
small 
number 
of 

students have such a significant 
impact in my classroom? The 
answer, I believe, lies in the 
concept of “critical mass,” the 
idea that it takes a critical mass 
of minority faculty and students 
not only for students of color to 
thrive within a predominately 
white institution, but also for 
the entire campus community to 
realize the educational benefits 
of racial diversity. The concept of 
“critical mass” was crucial to the 
U.S. Supreme Court decision in 
the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger and 
Gratz v. Bollinger cases, which 
ruled it was constitutional for 
the University to use race as a 
factor in admissions.

Since I first entered college in 

1981 and for most of my years as 
an undergraduate, as a graduate 
student and finally as a faculty 
member, I had been a beneficiary 
of “critical mass.” But it wasn’t 
until I saw the impact of 
Prop. 2 in my classroom that I 
came to fully appreciate how 
important critical mass was 
to the experiences of students 
of color and therefore to the 
realization of the educational 
benefits 
of 
racial 
diversity. 

Students who feel invisible and 
marginalized within the larger 
college community are unlikely 
to feel the confidence necessary 
to speak up and have an impact 
on classroom discussions even in 
those rare occasions when they 
are not the only person of color 
in the classroom. All of us in the 
University 
community 
suffer 

when the promise of “critical 
mass” goes unrealized.

T

he 
cat’s 
out 
of 
the 

bag: We won’t have a 
commencement speaker 

at 
the 
class 
of 

2017’s 
graduation 

ceremony. 
The 

University 
of 

Michigan, 
once 

again, has bucked 
concerns 
that 

students 
who 

were part of the 
Bicentennial 
Commencement 
Student 
Advisory 

Committee 
raised. 

Personally, I’m a little frustrated 
about how much outrage this 
has caused in comparison to 
more pressing social issues in 
our community, such as the 
Ann Arbor Police Department’s 
killing of Aura Rosser in 2014. 
But, I do understand that having 
a commencement speaker is 
important to a lot of people, so 
I think it’s worth reflecting on 
what we would want from a 
commencement speaker. Like a 
missing jigsaw piece, it’s often 
easiest to appreciate the ideal 
qualities of something when you 
don’t have it. 

The 
best 
commencement 

addresses I’ve heard offer us 
words of wisdom. As I’ve written 
in the past, I think one of the 
University’s great pedagogical 
weaknesses is that there isn’t 
enough of a focus on creating a 
personal ethos, a code to live by. 
A speaker could partially rectify 
this problem. In David Foster 
Wallace’s famous speech “This is 
Water,” he extols the importance 
of empathy. Wallace is acutely 
aware of how a cynic could 
easily reduce this to a bromide, 
remarking, “Stated as an English 
sentence, of course, this is just a 
banal platitude, but the fact is that 
in the day to day trenches of adult 
existence, banal platitudes can 

have a life or death importance, 
or so I wish to suggest to you on 
this dry and lovely morning.”

But his telling of a 

story makes the lesson 
meaningful. We need 
someone who can tie 
together our four years 
of education, who can 
show us how to be as 
compassionate people, 
who has led by example, 
who can show us to do 
the same. Essentially, 
to me, a great speaker 
would give us guidance 

on what it really means to be the 
Leaders and the Best.

Secondly, the speech should 

be 
uncontroversial. 
I 
don’t 

subscribe to the belief that 
inviting someone to give a speech 
is an endorsement of their views 
and finding someone who is 
totally 
uncontroversial 
has 

become 
increasingly 
difficult. 

Just ask the Dalai Lama, who 
was protested by students at 
University of California at San 
Diego after being invited as its 
commencement speaker.

Last year, the University chose 

to bring Michael Bloomberg, 
who, while I don’t agree with all 
his political views, I thought was 
an admirable choice. However, 
many students were upset after 
Bloomberg delivered his address. 
We could reduce his speech 
to a truism about engaging 
with people who disagree with 
you. But just like David Foster 
Wallace, the devil is in the details. 
He chose to deliver his message 
by attacking student activists 
who have the noble goal of trying 
to 
help 
make 
marginalized 

students feel more comfortable 
at our University. It’s important 
to critically discuss the methods 
they’ve used to achieve that goal, 
but I wonder if commencement 
is the right place for that. We 

deserve a speech which makes all 
students feel included.

The 
speech 
should 
also 

address what it means for us to be 
graduating, right here, right now. 
What do 200 years of excellence 
from the University mean? We’re 
graduating into a world that is 
increasingly fractured along lines 
of race, class, geography, nation 
and culture. The list goes on. I 
appreciate that it may be difficult 
to balance these last two goals, but 
I think with careful deliberation, 
it’s possible. Recently, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

co-authored an op-ed about the 
importance 
of 
continuing 
to 

attract international scholars in 
our current political climate. We 
don’t need a polemic, but advice 
on how we, as global citizens, can 
navigate this fractious world.

Lastly, 
the 
University’s 

bicentennial 
should 
be 
a 

celebration 
of 
200 
years 
of 

excellence. Let’s be frank: This 
is likely a major fundraising 
opportunity for the University by 
building a connection to its alumni. 
But I feel that the administration 
swung too far in that direction. 
Our 
commencement 
may 
be 

part of a larger ceremony, but it’s 
still our commencemnet! The 
University could have picked an 
alum to give our commencement 
speech, which would have allowed 
the administration to celebrate the 
bicentennial without sacrificing 
the address.

Truth be told, I don’t have 

anyone particular in mind, and 
I doubt that the University will 
change course this late into the 
process. But I think at the very 
least, we should all do some 
reflecting on what the past four 
years have meant to us.

E

very time I walk into 
the 
humorless, 
dry, 

corporate 
settings 

that 
are 
career 

networking 
events 

on campus, a poison 
is mainlined directly 
into my soul, further 
transforming 
the 

unique, 
colorful 

qualities 
of 
my 

creative 
identity 

into the gray, bland 
qualifications 
of 

a 
future 
“adult 

who sits behind an 
expensive desk.”

Despite the dread associated 

with 
these 
numerous 

networking 
events, 
I, 
like 

nearly every other student on 
this campus, have willingly 
submitted 
myself 
to 
this 

pre-professional, 
LinkedIn-

required, 
handshaking 

environment that dominates 
campus — an environment 
that permeates nearly every 
major and school here at the 
University of Michigan.

On this campus, we are 

offered 
an 
overwhelming 

number of workshops, résumé-
building exercises, company 
immersions and career fairs 
that we, as one of the most 
competitive 
and 
successful 

student bodies in the country, 
utilize aggressively.

But 
in 
the 
process, 
a 

smothering 
competitive 

culture is created that has a 
profound effect of distorting the 
judgments and true motivations 
of 
students. 
Individuals 
on 

campus are forced to sacrifice 
passionate 
talents 
and 

interests during the seemingly 
endless competition of career 
planning, campus involvement, 
networking and studying.

Arriving at the University, 

students are advised in a 
rational 
manner 
to 
choose 

a major that both captures 
their 
interests 
while 
also 

being 
career 
conscious. 

Essentially, do what you love, 
but make sure there are jobs 
on the other end. Choosing 
to study political science, I 
made 
a 
mature 
concession 

from my previous desires to 
study writing and history. I 
believed the major would still 
offer courses and assignments 
that 
would 
capture 
my 

creativity and curiosity, while 
simultaneously being one of 
the 
undergraduate 
degrees 

that demonstrated intellectual 
maturity and competence and 
a future career path in law, 
public policy or business. As 
opposed to pursuing a major 
more suited for writing or 

studying history, I would be the 
conscious adult planning his 
responsible future — a modest 

sacrifice that was 
sure to pay academic 
and 
professional 

dividends.

Yet this sacrifice 

grew in size and 
nature due to the 
environment 
here 

on campus. I was 
suddenly acquainted 
with the ever-present 
campus 
social 

pressure and anxiety 

that forces students to join 
every 
goddamn 
professional 

club associated with law, health 
and business. In addition, I felt 
pressure to begin to utilize the 
seemingly endless opportunities 
offered through the campus 
career center.

As 
I 
took 
on 
these 

opportunities, 
the 
creative 

elements and unique talents I 
once believed to have needed 
to be stamped, pressed and 
molded through a series of 
deathly 
corporate 
résumé 

workshops 
and 
internship 

preparation seminars in order 
to present myself, with a 
plastic smile and customized 
name tag, to an interviewer 
waiting to see how well my 
professional qualities matched 
up against my fellow peers in 
a desperate attempt to be an 
intern for their multinational 
risk management corporation.

And all of this was due 

to 
the 
level 
of 
aggressive 

competitiveness 
that 

dominates nearly every field of 
study on campus. The amount 
of dialogue dedicated to the 
stories of secured internships 
in New York City, Washington 
D.C. and San Francisco must 
fill the halls of every building 
on campus. Students openly 
brag about how busy their 
color-coded schedules are as 
they work toward their double 
major and minor while also 
serving 
in 
leadership 
roles 

within multiple clubs and still 
finding time to tour companies, 
attend career prep courses, 
handle phone interviews and 
refine their résumés.

The competition is seemingly 

endless with students securing 
undergraduate spots only to 
apply for new more prestigious 
and 
well-connected 
schools 

within the University, such 
as the Ford School of Public 
Policy or the minor in business 
through the Ross School of 
Business. 
And 
even 
more 

anxiety-inducing, 
students 

from other fields of study 
often come charging into new 

double majors to “diversify” 
their 
academic 
background, 

because why wouldn’t you take 
18 credits a semester? You want 
a job, don’t you?

I personally know a double 

major 
in 
neuroscience 
and 

English pursuing a business 
minor from the Business School 
with the intention of applying 
for a joint JD-MD program at 
Duke University. Yes, a brain 
surgeon 
lawyer 
who 
also 

owns a small business while 
simultaneously writing for The 
Atlantic.

This 
induces 
anxiety 

and professional panic that 
reverberates 
throughout 

campus, 
distracting 
and 

distancing students from their 
original academic intentions and 
goals. I wrote a piece previously 
about the incredible nature 
and necessity of substantive 
learning. Essential to that was 
the curiosity and interest found 
within the student. Creativity 
and uniqueness can easily die 
within the hyperconnectivity 
of 
competition 
for 
careers. 

The LinkedIn profiles, text 
of 
résumés 
and 
leadership 

experience 
can 
often 

permanently steal a talented 
student away from a piece of 
work or an assignment that 
had the potential to create 
something infinitely greater.

And as I stumbled around 

career fairs pretending that I 
would secure a position within 
the Business School later in my 
academic career, I put on hold 
talents and specific interests 
that made me unique. I did not 
utilize my curiosity and passion 
in a manner that exponentially 
increases my performance and 
quality of work. Writing and 
studying history were central to 
my sense of intelligence, and the 
eventual embracement of both 
increased the success I’ve had 
academically, 
professionally 

and socially.

This is not a piece against 

hard work, networking and 
professionalism — instead, this 
is a simple observation that 
students on this campus often 
over-exhaust 
their 
unique 

potentials 
in 
a 
desperate 

competition among themselves 
pursuing fleeting internships, 
professional experiences and 
future careers. There are other 
methods and routes to the 
career and professional goals 
that may seem unorthodox or 
daunting, but often prove to be 
far more beneficial in the end.

‘“Five Came Back” now streaming on Netflix
‘Came Back’ fascinates as 
meditation on war & film

Star-studded cast explores the travesties of wartime filmmaking

Sometimes, 
the 
greatest 

weapon to use in a war is 
not a gun, but a camera. By 
capturing 
the 
grittiness 

and travesties of battle, war 
documentarians 
have 
the 

power to shape the story 
they are telling, subsequently 
educating 
and 
influencing 

their audiences. This kind of 
tactic became essential during 
World War II, when five Old 
Hollywood 
filmmakers 
— 

John Ford (“The Searchers”), 
John Huston (“The Maltese 
Falcon”), George Stevens (“A 
Place in the Sun”), Frank Capra 
(“It’s a Wonderful Life”) and 
William 
Wyler 

(“Mrs. Miniver”) 
— enlisted into the 
army to document 
American efforts 
in 
fighting 
the 

menacing 
Axis 

Powers. 
The 

stories of these 
famous men, all 
of whom risked 
their 
lives 
and 

their 
status 
as 

top 
Hollywood 

directors 
during 
WWII, 

are 
given 
a 
documentary 

treatment of their own in 
Netflix’s beguiling three-part 
series “Five Came Back,” based 
on the book by film historian 
Mark Harris.

Firing 
on 
all 
cinematic 

cylinders, “Five Came Back” is 
enlightening and entertaining 
even for non-history buffs. 
The 
documentary 
operates 

as 
an 
absorbing 
take 
on 

1940s filmmaking, a complex 
exploration 
of 
American 

propaganda and a haunting 
depiction of post-war milieu.

Meryl 
Streep 
(“Florence 

Foster 
Jenkins”) 
narrates 

the background behind these 
efforts 
with 
natural 
poise 

and 
thoroughness, 
while 

five 
current 
Hollywood 

filmmakers — Francis Ford 
Coppola 
(“Apocalypse 

Now”), 
Steven 
Spielberg 

(“Bridge of Spies”), Lawrence 
Kasdan 
(“The 
Accidental 

Tourist”), 
Guillermo 
del 

Toro (“Pan’s Labyrinth”) and 
Paul 
Greengrass 
(“Captain 

Phillips”) 
— 
discuss 
the 

social impact of the films 
made before, during and after 
the war. But perhaps the 
strongest pillar of “Five Came 
Back” stems from the prolific 
backbone and perceptive eye 
of director Laurent Bouzereau 
(“Roman 
Polanski: 
A 
Film 

Memoir”), who has produced a 
plethora of behind-the-scenes 
documentaries for decades.

Though 
“Five 
Came 

Back” has some difficulty in 
structuring 
its 
formidable 

subject 
matter, 
Bouzereau 

unfolds 
enough 
compelling 

social context to reflect an 
entire half-decade of history 
into three hours. Tracing from 
the late 1930s to the late 1940s, 
“Five 
Came 
Back” 
tackles 

cinema’s importance during 

WWII-era America, using the 
work of Capra, Stevens, Huston, 
Ford and Wyler as examples. 
Along with being thematically 
engrossing, “Five Came Back” 
pleases aesthetically, as well. 
There’s 
an 
inventive 
title 

sequence, an epic horn-heavy 
score from composer Thomas 
Newman (“American Beauty”) 
and a gorgeous mix of color 
and black-and-white archival 
footage from the 1940s. 

With 
each 
blistering 

detail 
and 
newsreel, 
the 

documentary tracks how the 
styles and approaches of these 
five 
influential 
filmmakers 

ultimately shaped their outlook 
on the war. Capra and Wyler 
sensed the threatening rise 
of Hitler and Nazism before 

Hollywood did, 
while 
Ford, 

Huston 
and 

Stevens 
were 

simply 
looking 

for 
adventure 

when 
deciding 

to join in the 
war effort. The 
differences 
in 

incentives 
to 

enlist — personal 
histories versus 
patriotism 
— 

makes the documentary all 
the more enriching as the 
directors’ attitudes toward the 
war change over time.

We observe Capra and Wyler 

struggle 
under 
the 
weight 

of 
governmental 
pressure 

and box office failure with 
their propaganda films. We 
see Stevens, who was known 
for 
directing 
light-hearted 

comedies and musicals, grow 
hardened and alienated by the 
war when filming in Tunisia. 
We watch as Ford and Huston 
were subjected to immense 
scrutiny from the armed forces 
they worked with.

On 
the 
battlefront, 
the 

directors especially struggled 
much more in trying to combine 
their artistic vision with their 
real-war 
experiences. 
War 

propaganda may not have been 
the most ethical of decisions 
on 
Hollywood’s 
part, 
but 

“Five Came Back” shows the 
manipulation of World War 
II through film in all of its 
complexity.

Capra and Wyler initially 

abandoned and reassembled 
a film project titled “The 
Negro Soldier” with African-
American playwright Carlton 
Moss. 
By 
subverting 
the 

standard negative Hollywood 
portrayal of Black people, the 
film gave a realistic depiction 
of 
the 
Black 
American 

experience during WWII, as 
it garnered rave reviews and 
attracted 
Black 
Americans 

to join the war. At the same 
time, Capra had created war-
themed 
cartoons 
with 
Dr. 

Seuss and Walt Disney to 
amuse and motivate American 
soldiers, but at the expense 
of drawing racist caricatures 
of the Japanese. Such irony 
demonstrates 
the 
dynamics 

of race in WWII America and 
how film as a medium had a role 

in perpetuating perceptions of 
different racial groups.

To 
see 
these 
highly 

respected directors become 
grounded by the war is as 
gripping as it is troubling. 
As the war pushed these 
directors to their filmmaking 
limits, they each found ways to 
highlight the humanity within 
the 
inhumane 
atmosphere 

of war, all while taking an 
emotional and artistic toll by 
being on the battlefront.

If there’s anything to take 

away from “Five Came Back,” 
it’s that the power of film isn’t 
just in storytelling, but the 
emotional and social context 
behind 
the 
storytelling. 

Capra, Huston, Stevens, Ford 
and Wyler weren’t just great 
American filmmakers for their 
compelling movies; they were 
great because their movies, 
war-related or not, were deeply 
rooted in something that was 
authentic 
and 
devastating 

enough to move audiences.

Back”

Series Premiere

Netflix

Dive into Tei Shi’s ‘Space’ 
of indie experimentalism 

It’s hard to directly capture the 

essence of Argentinian singer-
songwriter Tei Shi’s newest 
album, Crawl Space. A patchwork 
quilt of sounds: echoing melodies 
dissolve into bold synth-pop 
harmonies, 
discombobulated 

beats peeter off into steady 
instrumental 
backgrounds. 

Crawl 
Space 
almost 
seems 

unfinished, a scrapbook of odd 
bits and pieces; as you rifle 
through its mismatching pages, 
you are plunged into Tei Shi’s 
dreamscape, her most intimate 
moments, her darkest fears.

While this album is more 

complex than any of Tei Shi’s 
previous 
EPs, 
incorporating 

more elements and drawing 
from a wider variety of musical 
genres, it is infinitely more 
private 
than 
anything 
she 

has created in the past. Crawl 
Space is an exorcism: Tei Shi 
confronting her demons one 
angelic note at a time.

Tei Shi’s style has significantly 

matured 
since 
the 
release 

of her very first EP Saudade 
in 2013. However, there are 
certain components that have 
remained constant. The simple 
combination 
of 
airy 
vocals 

and 
dynamic 
background, 

most 
prominently 
found 
in 

songs “Keep Running” and 
“Creep,” directly parallels songs 
“Basically” and “Nevermind the 
End” from previous albums. But 

while these past releases were 
heavily minimalist, not allowing 
songs to evolve into greater 
complexity, Crawl Space dives 
into the unknown with verve. 
Its songs are varying, relying 
less on vocals and allowing 
background rhythms to take a 
more prominent role in creating 
dynamism. 

For instance, in “Baby,” the 

smooth blend of electronic and 
instrumental components help 
bolster Tei Shi’s 
croon 
of 
“Oh, 

baby 
love” 
and 

turn the fourth 
track 
of 
Crawl 

Space 
into 
an 

otherworldly blur. 
Contrastingly, “Justify” is all 
sharp edges, honed beats daring 
anyone listening to “justify me, 
now.” The final song, “Sleepy” 
takes an entirely new direction 
altogether, with soft piano chords 
forming a lullaby-esque eulogy. 

Tei 
Shi’s 
music 
is 
an 

adventure. Like an antiquated 
mansion, Crawl Space is a maze 
of winding corridors and hidden 
rooms, every turn of the corner 
revealing a new surprise. Layers 
upon ghostly layers, the tracks 
in Crawl Space consistently work 
to uncover fresh perspectives on 
Tei Shi.

For example, “Como Si” stands 

out as the only track sung in Tei 
Shi’s native language, Spanish. 
It offers a glimpse into an aspect 
of Tei Shi that had never been 
significantly 
explored 
within 

her 
music. 
The 
song 
itself 

is 
achingly 
vulnerable: 
The 

muted atmospheric background 
conceding the beauty of the 
language itself to encompass 
a majority of the song. Even if 
you can’t directly translate the 
lyrics, the caring devotion in Tei 
Shi’s soft utterances makes the 
significance of “Como Si” clear.

Though long, Crawl Space 

is enticing. Each song hints at 
something you can almost see, but 
not quite. Largely abstract, what 
helps ground this constantly-

evolving 
album 

are 
the 
brief 

interjections 
of 
spoken 
word 

recordings. Songs 
“way to record,” 
“bad singer” and 

“bad girl” feature solely the 
bold voice of a little girl. These 
fleeting 
moments 
of 
clarity 

help structure and ground the 
sprawling album. They also 
help construct a narrative; the 
unflinching declarations of “I’m 
a bad singer / I can’t do anything 
well” and “I’m the baddest singer 
/ I confess it” found in “bad 
singer” and “bad girl” provide 
insight into Tei Shi’s fears, 
perhaps displaying the voices 
she has to overcome whenever 
producing a new album.

Crawl Space shines a spotlight 

on the skeletons in Tei Shi’s 
closet. Every track is unique, 
forming an album that shines 
with creativity, ingenuity and, 
most importantly, honesty. With 
it, Tei Shi stands bare, facing 
the dark expanse of covert fears 
and insecurities with dauntless 
confidence.

DAILY MUSIC COLUMN

The reason ‘emo’ just isn’t 
as sad as everyone thinks 

Every genre of music inevitably 

gets reduced to a stereotype in 
the eyes of the public. Hip hop is 
often cast as bluntly misogynistic 
party music. Jazz is thought 
to be impenetrable, highbrow 
virtuosity. The two words “heavy 
metal” immediately call to mind 
dudes with long beards, tattoos 
and leather jackets.

And for “emo” rock — a label 

now so derided that many bands 
who come close to the phrase will 
immediately disavow it — most 
people will picture immensely 
sad teenagers, the drama of their 
privileged lives so overwhelming 
that they can only find solace 
in overly emotional, directly 
relatable guitar music. You’ll 
hear the adjective “whiny” to 
describe every vocalist. The word 
“wristcutter” might be thrown 
around. 
It’s 
an 
unpleasant, 

derisive view of a subculture, 
and it’s no surprise that no band 
wants to be associated with it.

For 
this 
image, 
I 
blame 

Rivers Cuomo and Weezer. Of 
course, they didn’t invent emo 
(that dubious honor often gets 
awarded to ’80s D.C. hardcore 
band 
Rites 
of 
Spring), 
but 

Weezer parlayed its early success 
into 
1996’s 
Pinkerton. 
Their 

sophomore record was a vast 
departure from the often kid-
friendly, goofy image of The Blue 
Album, which propelled the band 
into stardom with hit singles like 
“Buddy Holly,” “My Name Is 
Jonas” and “The Sweater Song.”

Instead, Pinkerton followed in 

the footsteps of the first album’s 
“Say It Ain’t So,” a beautiful, 
personal 
ballad 
by 
Cuomo 

about his parents’ divorce, his 

stepfather and alcoholism. But 
where “Say It Ain’t So” felt 
perfectly crafted and poetic, 
these new songs were messy 
diary entries scrawled at 2 a.m., 
filled with awkward moments 
and way too much information. 
Pinkerton 
explores 
Cuomo’s 

Asian fetish, his infatuation with 
a lesbian and all of his deepest 
insecurities about fame and sex 
in the most painful detail.

While initial reaction was 

infamously negative, the record 
soon gained a cult following 
and an eventual reputation as 
the best Weezer album — which 
means that plenty of bands still 
cite it as an influence. Within 
less than ten years, emo went 
mainstream, 
as 
groups 
like 

Brand 
New, 
Paramore, 
My 

Chemical Romance and Simple 
Plan wrote catchy, overwrought 
anthems of the suffering caused 
by teenage hormones.

While I think all of these bands 

are great in their own right, 
their hit songs, coupled with the 
lesser efforts of trendy imitators, 
created the idea of the “emo 
aesthetic.” This label is perhaps 
best exemplified by Dashboard 
Confessional, whose frontman, 
Chris Carrabba, is the platonic 
ideal of emo. He’s a heavily 
tattooed, broodingly handsome 
acoustic-guitar 
strummer 

whose songs are almost always 
addressed to a beautiful female 
“you” who constantly gives him 
unbearable stress, hope, joy and 
pain.

Carrabba’s 2002 performance 

on on “MTV Unplugged” might 
be the defining moment of emo. 
He wasn’t an especially famous 
artist at that point in his career 
(Unplugged is his only album to 
go platinum), but Carrabba is 
surrounded by adoring young 

fans who sing every word back 
to him throughout the entire 
show, amplifying and validating 
all his most personal lyrics. It 
establishes 
this 

relative 
unknown 

as a great leader, 
a 
quasi-spiritual 

guide 
whose 

messages are filled 
with great meaning 
for his followers, 
and it opens your 
mind to how much 
impact a non-pop 
emo artist can have 
on 
people 
who 

understand 
what 

they’re saying.

As 
more 
and 

more kids became 
devoted 
to 
what 

these singers had to say, the 
oversharing 
and 
spitefulness 

of many emo rock artists soon 
spread to other genres. Kanye 
West’s 808s and Heartbreak and 
Yeezy’s general lack of a filter 
call to mind Pinkerton, while 
Drake’s tendency to name and 
describe his exes in vivid detail 
feels petty while also giving 
his songs an extra level of 
relatability. For many of these 
artists, authenticity is no longer 
the rejection of corporations 
or the cultivation of a “tough 
guy” image — it’s the revelation 
of their darkest secrets for the 
entertainment of a paying crowd.

But when painful emotions 

become a path to money, how do 
we actually deal with the pain?

In a piece for The Ringer from 

last year, Rachel Premack looked 
at the popular community of 
Tumblr users that suffer from 
depression. They post black-
and-white pictures of a sad, 
lonely looking Lana Del Rey, 
or quotes like: “It’s not that I 

Lo Theisen explores the misassociation of emo and angst

don’t enjoy being alive, but my 
favourite part of being alive 
is 
being 
asleep.” 
Premack’s 

piece 
explored 
the 
conflict 

and challenges of creating a 
community that accepts and 
destigmatizes 
mental 
illness 

without romanticizing it.

“It became cool to define 

yourself by mental illness (on 
Tumblr),” one user is quoted 
as saying. “Like, in order to be 
interesting or valid, you had to 
have some kind of it.”

In the same way, new emo 

artists 
are 
often 

judged by the depth 
of their backstories 
and pain of their 
past 
experiences. 

The 
traumas 
of 

songwriters 
make 

them 
interesting 

and cool. The worst 
thing 
that’s 
ever 

happened to them is 
the best thing they 
have to offer the 
public.

To quote fellow 

columnist 
Will 

Stewart, “When did 
hating yourself and 

feeling like you’re going to have 
a heart attack become a bragging 
right?”

But a new wave of bands is 

cutting against the trend of 
aestheticized pain, using their 
music as a path for real artistic 

catharsis and reminding us of 
its true power. Modern Baseball, 
originally a catchy band that 
whined about girls a lot, has 
matured a great deal and now use 
their platform for social activism 
and the destigmatization of 
mental illness. The Hotelier 
consistently has some of the 
best lyrics in rock, words that 
perfectly 
characterize 
the 

psychological 
fight 
against 

darkness. Meanwhile, Hop Along 
vocalist Frances Quinlan imbues 
every words she sings with 
nearly unfathomable emotion 
and power, and Kevin Abstract 
continued to tell heartfelt stories 
and create better representation 
for queer rappers with last year’s 
American Boyfriend.

Most recently, the punk band 

Sorority 
Noise 
has 
released 

You’re Not As_____As You Think, 
already one of the best records 
of the year and a potential 
landmark work in how we think 
about pain and art.

To get the elephant out of the 

room, yes, You’re Not As_____As 
You Think is “depressing.” In 
“Disappeared,” singer Cameron 
Boucher notes that “just this 
year I lost a basketball team to 
heaven,” and of this group, the 
suicide of a friend named Sean in 
particular hangs heavy over the 
music. The opening track sees 
Boucher forget that Sean is dead 
and make an impromptu visit to 

his old house. “I saw you in there 
/ But I was looking at myself,” 
he sings hauntingly. Each track 
that follows continues to explore 
Boucher’s isolation, the pain 
and the grief caused by these 
tragedies.

But Boucher is not simply a 

man wallowing in his sadness, 
looking for pity from fans. 
You’re 
Not 
As_____As 
You 

Think is a brief album, and each 
word he sings sounds carefully 
considered, straining to hold 
the weight of a thousand other 
sentiments 
left 
unsaid. 
He 

pictures these touching images 
of where his friends are now, 
imagining them listening to The 
Gaslight Anthem in heaven or 
“shooting jumpers with Jesus, 
Mary and Joseph.” He’s trying so 
hard to fight against numbness 
and 
anxiety 
and 
loneliness, 

searching for humanity and 
connection and reality.

All 
stereotypes 
are 

dehumanizing, and while some 
are more harmful than others, 
the idea of emo rock as a genre for 
privileged kids to whine about 
their lame problems has never 
been more untrue or unfair to its 
artists. These melodies and lyrics 
are vehicles for connection and 
sanity in a terrifying, sometimes 
awful world. At the core of emo 
isn’t a glamorization of sadness 
or death, but an all-out, high-
stakes battle for life.

‘Turtle’ tells simple but 
enchanting tale of hope

SONY PICTURES CLASSICS

Still from animated film ‘The Red Turtle’

Most survival movies end 

in rescue. In “The Martian,” 
Matt Damon makes it home to 
tell his tale; in “127 Hours,” 
James Franco, albeit painfully, 
escapes 
the 
boulder 
that 

entraps him; in “Cast Away,” 
Tom Hanks makes it off that 
godforsaken 
island, 
sadly 

without Wilson. While these 
films 
follow 
the 
familiar 

structure of shipwreck, despair 
and rescue, “The Red Turtle,” 
directed by Michaël Dudok de 
Wit (“Father and Daughter”) 
details a similar narrative in 
completely 
different 
terms. 

There is no 
physical 
rescue 
in 

“The 
Red 

Turtle,” 
no 

return home, 
no 
grand 

welcome 
reception, 
no 
special 

on the news. 
The rescue is 
the life that 
our castaway 
makes on the island that 
imprisoned him. Perhaps what 
the film reveals is that survival 
is 
more 
about 
improving 

the 
present 
situation 
than 

escaping it. “The Red Turtle” 
is a beautifully animated film 
about survival, but moreso 
about life and the events that 

define it.

“The Red Turtle” begins 

with an unnamed castaway, 
thrust from his small boat 
onto an isolated island. He is 
frustrated, 
fed 

up and alone. He 
sets sail thrice 
on a handmade 
raft, 
but 
each 

time the raft is 
mysteriously 
hit from below 
and dismantled. 
Our castaway is 
then forced to 
swim back to the 
island, left alone yet again. He 
discovers that the source of 
his raft’s destruction is a large 
red turtle. The turtle makes 

its way to the 
island, and in 
a 
blind 
rage 

our 
castaway 

kills the turtle, 
leaving it for 
dead. 
Days 

pass 
and 
he 

feels 
remorse 

for 
killing 

the 
turtle; 

he 
attempts 

to 
revive 
it 

and fails. The 

turtle then transforms into a 
beautiful red-headed woman. 
Long story short, the castaway 
and 
turtle-turned-woman 

fall in love and have a baby, 
who 
possesses 
the 
human 

appearance of his father, but 
the aquatic (and turtle-like) 
capabilities of his mother. The 

son leaves to explore what else 
the world has to offer, leaving 
his parents alone on the island. 
Years pass and the couple has 
gone gray with age, our castaway 

dies in his sleep as 
an old man, lying 
next to his love. 
She wakes up to 
find 
him 
dead, 

cries over his body 
in mourning and 
turns 
back 
into 

the red turtle. The 
screen 
fades 
to 

black as she returns 
to her home in the 

ocean.

“The Red Turtle” is subtle 

both in narrative and animation. 
The film’s aesthetic is minimal, 
yet breathtaking. The simple, 
line-drawn characters contrast 
nicely with the deeply textured 
landscapes of the island and the 
ocean. The lack of dialogue, while 
sometimes slow, is a welcome 
change 
from 
the 
talkative 

anthropomorphic characters of 
animation’s past and present. 
The creatures in the film are 
full of personality without the 
need for excessive chatter. For 
example, 
the 
crabs 
develop 

their own dance through their 
charming actions and antics, like 
following our castaway around 
wherever he goes.

The narrative is simple, but 

with a magical, beautiful twist. 
“The Red Turtle” may be a tale 
of survival, but tells the story in 
a way that emphasizes thriving 
over surviving.

Michigan defeats Yellow Jackets in triple overtime 

to claim first championship in program history

DETROIT — The Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team 

needed 
a 
miracle 
and 

then 
some 
to 
become 
the 

Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament champions.

Tied at 67 with 10 seconds left, 

Georgia Tech was taking the 
ball up for the final possession 
of the quarter and potentially 
of the season. Staunch defense 
forced a routine, long-range 
two from Elo Edeferioka. Her 
shot appeared wide right, but 
not before the whistle blew 
on a shooting foul by senior 
guard Siera Thompson with 0.6 
seconds left on the clock. Any 
energy that the Wolverines had 
was sucked out of the room.

Edeferioka 
went 
to 
the 

charity stripe in what would 
have decided the game’s fate. 
With 44 years as a program 
under its belt and nothing to 
show for it in the Crisler Center 
rafters, it appeared that one 
controversial foul call could 
dash the hopes of changing 

that.

“I was praying that they 

wouldn’t go in,” Dunston said. 
“It’s a very hard moment to be 
in, to win the game on free-
throws. I was hoping that she 
was going to miss.”

Hopeful booing from the 

Wolverine faithful permeated 
Calihan Hall as Edeferioka 
stepped to the line for her first 
attempt. 
The 

shot 
clanked 

off the back of 
the 
rim, 
flew 

in the air and 
hit the ground 
— the thought 
of her missing 
the second free 
throw becoming 
a reality in the 
minds 
of 
the 

thousands 
of 

fans looking on.

As Edeferioka 

released the ball on her second 
attempt, she found the inside 
of the rim, only for it to bounce 
out to the right into the arms 
of Dunston, whose prayers 
were answered. In improbable 

fashion, Michigan was neck-
and-neck in overtime with a 
team they beat by 40 points 
earlier in the season.

“We’ve been in that situation 

before and I’m like ‘Not again. 
Let the kids win the basketball 
game.’ ” Barnes Arico said. 
“Our kids just played their butt 
off and when you get that call at 
the end of the game it’s a tough 

one.”

From 
there, 

the 
rest 
is 

history. 
The 

back-and-
forth 
nature 

of 
the 
game 

continued 
for 

two 
overtimes 

with both teams 
struggling 
to 
capture 

momentum, 
before 
the 

Wolverines blew 

the door wide open in the third 
and final overtime period, in 
which they came out with an 
89-79 win to become WNIT 
champions.

The thought of Michigan as 

WNIT champions, and especially 
the 
missed 
free 
throws, 
is 

remarkable 
considering 
how 

the Wolverines fought to tie the 
game. Georgia Tech appeared 
poised to win after an and-one 
layup put the Yellow Jackets up, 
67-61, with 1:23 remaining in 
the final quarter. The entirety 
of Michigan’s season, marred 
with program record-breaking 
victories 
alongside 
extreme 
disappointment, 
would come to 
a 
close 
in 
83 

seconds.

The 

Wolverines were 
gassed, 
and 

sought the hero 
that 
they’ve 

rarely 
needed 

this season. And 
they found one 
in Katelynn Flaherty.

The junior guard received a 

pass at the top of the arc from 
Nicole Munger, where Flaherty 
danced around screens set by 
Jillian 
Dunston, 
ultimately 

launching a 23-foot trey that 
found the bottom of the net 
to bring Michigan’s deficit to 
three with 1:06 remaining.

After an errant Georgia Tech 

layup attempt, the Wolverines 
called a timeout to draw up 
what could have been their 
final play of the season.

But it seemed as if the 

final play was decided before 

Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico 
said 
a 

word 
— 
the 

ball had to be 
in 
Flaherty’s 

hands.

Sure enough, 

coming out of 
the timeout, she 
was in a similar 
situation 
with 

the ball at the 
top of the arc, 
looking 
for 

separation to launch a three. 
With 12 seconds remaining, 
Flaherty dribbled to the right 
corner 
behind 
the 
3-point 

line, using all of her might and 
kicking her legs mid-air to 

rocket the ball, arching over the 
height of the shot clock.

Flaherty drained the three 

to tie the game, and she jumped 
into Dunston’s arms at halfcourt 
with the accompaniment of a 
roaring crowd and the entire 
Michigan bench out of its seats.

“I saw two good opportunities 

to shoot the ball,” Flaherty said. 
“I knew that was as much space 
as I was getting so I just relaxed 
and shot. That was the big 
thing. A lot of my other shots 
I was tense and it’s funny how 
when I just relax and do what I 
had to do I made it.

“Watching 
UConn 
and 

Mississippi 
State 
yesterday, 

when the girl hit the final shot 
I was like, ‘Wow, I wonder what 
that feels like.’ And then we got 
on a similar stage. It’s smaller, 
but it’s awesome.”

Call it luck, or call it hard-

fought will, but Michigan finally 
made it over the hump to hang 
a banner. For the Wolverines, 
they needed a flawless final 
minute of regulation. And in 
that minute, 44 years of waiting 
materialized right on cue.

“I knew that 
was as much 
space as I was 

getting.”

praying that 
they wouldn’t

One final test of will

T

hrough all the smiles and 
joy on the court Saturday 
afternoon, after the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team won 
the WNIT, 
it would 
have been 
easy to 
forget 
where the 
team was 
nearly three 
weeks ago.

On that night, a night where 

they expected to break a 
three-year NCAA Tournament 
drought, the Wolverines had 
their hearts ripped out. Sitting 
at Revel and Roll bowling alley, 
the players watched, hopefully, 
as each region was revealed, with 
confidence that the team would 
soon hear its name called.

How sure did the team seem 

that it had earned a place in 
the field? As the final pairing 
in which the Wolverines 
would have fit was about to 
be announced, sophomore 
center Hallie Thome put on a 
wide smile, anticipating the 
good news. Instead, the names 
“Kansas State” and “Drake” 
came through the speakers. Her 
expression turned to shock.

Even after the best regular 

season in program history, 
Michigan would once again be 
relegated to the WNIT.

“The night we didn’t get into 

the NCAA’s I felt heartbroken 
for (seniors Danielle Williams 
and Siera Thompson),” said 
sophomore guard Nicole Munger. 
“But the next day in practice, we 
said we were doing it for them 
and we were winning it for them. 
This is for them.”

It would have been 

understandable if, given that 
heartbreak, Thome and the 
Wolverines hadn’t wanted to play 
at all in the WNIT. It’s possible 

that, in the immediate aftermath, 
they didn’t. It would have even 
been understandable if, after 
the NCAA selection committee 
doubted them, they started to 
doubt themselves. But after the 
way they played their final game, 
through three unprecedented 
championship overtimes, one 
thing was clear: they learned to 
embrace a tournament that they 
didn’t want, and they proved 
they would have belonged in the 
one that didn’t want them.

Looking back, maybe it 

shouldn’t have been much of 
a surprise that Michigan won 
the WNIT Final. It had already 
beaten its opponent, Georgia 
Tech, by a 40-point margin 
earlier this season in Atlanta. 
The Wolverines were probably 
the biggest snub from the Big 
Dance, and their talent made it 

easy enough to pencil them into 
the semifinals, where Barnes 
Arico had led them in each of the 
previous two seasons.

But there was something about 

a deep WNIT run that seemed 
less than inevitable.

In the WNIT, as with most 

tournaments, it takes more than 
talent to win it all. To win six 
straight games against teams of 
relatively comparable skill levels, 
no matter who is on your roster, 
takes will power. There’s little 
room for passivity.

And that’s where the 

uncertainty came in.

There is a reason the NIT and 

WNIT are so hard to predict. 
There is simply no telling how a 
team will respond to letdowns, 
no way to gauge whether a team 
will respond with motivation or 
resignation.

For the Michigan women’s 

basketball team, there must 
have been at least a fair share of 
each. The Wolverines knew they 
were one of the 64 best teams 
in the country — particularly 
considering they were ranked 
in the top 25 just weeks before 
the selection show — and that 
must have made them irate. It 
also could have made them feel 
defeated. All that hard work, all 
those wins, and they’re stuck in 
the same tournament they’ve 
been in both the previous two 
years? It’s not hard to see how 
that might have led to some 
passivity when the tournament 
began.

But whatever their immediate 

reaction, it was clear on Saturday 
afternoon that motivation 
eventually won out.

“They just wanted to prove 

the world that they had made 
a mistake and that Michigan 
basketball is a great team,” 
Barnes Arico said. “They refused 
to go away and it was just 
awesome to watch.”

It was only fitting, though, 

that there was one final test of 
will awaiting the Wolverines, 
even as they climbed through the 
tournament and ended up in the 
finals in nearby Detroit.

Trailing by three points with 

just 10 seconds remaining, junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty hoisted 
up a prayer that, somehow, went 
answered to tie the game.

Then, the unthinkable. 

Thompson was called for a foul 
while contesting Georgia Tech 
forward Elo Edeferioka’s jump 
shot with 0.6 seconds remaining. 
Seldom, if ever do referees call 
foul in moments in like that, but 

the whistle blew. It looked like 
one more shocking outcome 
awaited the Wolverines.

Instead, Edeferioka missed 

both free throws. Michigan did 
nothing to influence that, and 
no amount of will could have 
induced those misses. But given 
another chance, the Wolverines 
fought like hell. The game went 
into overtime, and then it went 
into another, then another. No 
other WNIT Championship 
had ever even gone to overtime 
before Saturday, but this one just 
wouldn’t end.

By the third overtime, the 

Wolverines had apparently had 
enough of leaving matters to 
chance. They put away the game 
and took home a double-digit win 
in triple overtime. Margins don’t 
usually get that steep in games 
that require so much extra time. 
Fifty-five minute games are rare, 
and the games that do make it 
that long are usually so close that 
they come down to one or two 
small plays.

Overtime is often decided by 

free throws. Triple overtimes are 
decided by will.

And on Saturday, Michigan 

was the team that wouldn’t let 
go. The Wolverines won the 
game, stormed the court and 
won the tournament they hadn’t 
even wanted to be in three 
weeks ago.

There was no way to go 

back and reverse the selection 
committee’s decision, no way to 
unfeel the emotions they felt in 
that bowling alley almost three 
weeks prior.

Instead, they felt something 

new: vindication.

‘M’ track enjoys success at Battle of the Blues

Last 
year, 
the 
Michigan 

women’s track and field team 
won the Battle of the Blues in 
Durham, N.C. while the men’s 
track and field team took 
second. This year, though, 
the roles reversed, and the 
men came out on top with 
the women following in the 
runner-up position. 

The 
Wolverines 
traveled 

south together to compete 
against 
Duke 
and 
North 

Carolina to open up the outdoor 
season. While the women’s 
competition 
was 
relatively 

close — Michigan’s women 
took second with 62 points, 
just 10 points below Duke and 
six above North Carolina — the 
men’s team claimed victory 
with 101 points with Duke 
trailing by 47 points. 

“It was really fun to be out 

there with all the guys, and the 
women’s team, too,” said senior 
thrower 
Grant 
Cartwright. 

“Something 
about 
outdoor 

season is a lot more fun than 
indoor season.” 

Cartwright, 
along 
with 

fellow All-American thrower 
junior Joe Ellis, contributed 
16 total points to the team’s 
overall score. Ellis claimed 
the hammer title with the 
second-best 
throw of his 
career 
(66.34 

meters) 
and 

Cartwright 
took the discus 
title 
with 
a 

career-best 
throw of 55.40 
meters. 

Michigan 

men’s 
coach 

Jerry Clayton 
was impressed by Cartwright’s 
performance, considering he 
was in three events in one 
day — discus, shot put and 
hammer. Cartwright, however, 
didn’t see that as a “burden” 
and focused instead on finally 
getting outdoors after a long 

indoor season. 

Joining 
the 
impressive 

throwing squad this year is 
freshman Andrew Liskowitz, 
who took the title for shot put. 
Cartwright believes it was the 
“highlight of the weekend” 
and emphasized how much the 
team rallied behind Liskowitz. 

Other notable 

performances 
from the men’s 
side included a 
one-through-
five 
sweep 
in 

the 1,500-meter 
run and the top 
two spots in the 
steeplechase. 
Senior 
sprinter 

Khoury 
Crenshaw 

claimed wins in both the 100-
meter run and 4x100 relay. 
The distance runners took four 
event titles with 11 top-four 
finishes. 

“It was an excellent meet,” 

Clayton said. “We had great 
performances in all the areas. 

Anytime you can win as a 
team, that’s what it was about. 
It was a really good day for the 
team.” 

Though the women didn’t 

fare as well as the men, 
Michigan 
women’s 
coach 

James Henry wasn’t looking 
to win — similar to his attitude 
last year. For him, the meet is 
meant to open the season with 
good competition and scoring 
is the least of his concerns. 

Senior distance runner Gina 

Sereno, though, still pushed 
forward to take first in the 
1,500-meter race with a time 
of 4:21.38 — a full two seconds 
over runner-up and teammate, 
senior 
mid-distance 
athlete 

Jamie 
Morrissey. 
Sereno, 

combined with the rest of 
the distance squad, racked 
up almost half of their team’s 
total. 

Although both Sereno and 

Morrissey don’t run the 1,500 
— it was Sereno’s first time — 
the duo pushed through the 
first 800 meters together. 

“As you’re running together 

you have a sense someone is 
running with you,” Sereno 
said. “It makes it easier to 
know someone else is there. 
(The race) was a product of us 
training together and working 
hard in pushing each other. 
Every race situation lends itself 
to a different outcome. But, 
being able to practice every day 
and knowing how we run led to 
this.”

Like the men’s side, the 

throwers contributed a great 
deal to the overall total. Junior 
Bailey Baker notched three 
points in the hammer throw 
with a distance of 55.17 — a 
full four-and-a-half feet better 
than her throw the previous 
week in the Pac-12 vs. Big Ten 
Challenge. 

“We got eight more meets 

before 
our 
conference 

championship,” Henry said. 
“This is one meet down and 
seven to go. This is a long long 
year, we want to improve and 
stay healthy and come together 
as a team. Those are our goals.” 

Men’s and women’s teams finish first and second, respectively, in Durham

take me home.” 

Though 
the 
Michigan 

women’s gymnastics team was 
350 miles from Ann Arbor, 
the Wolverines felt right at 
home at the NCAA Regional in 
Morgantown, W.Va. Michigan 
scored 197.50 points, which 
was enough to secure its 12th 
NCAA Regional victory. The 
Wolverines won five individual 
titles, tying a school record.

“They’re 

probably 
a 

little 
tired,” 

said Michigan 
coach 
Bev 

Plocki. 
“But 

right after the 
competition, 
they 
were 

definitely 
excited. It was 
a lot of fun.”

Michigan’s 

star 
performer was 
undoubtedly 
junior 
Paige 

Zaziski, 
who 

accounted 
for 
three 
of 

the 
Wolverines’ 
individual 

championships. Zaziski earned 
victories 
in 
the 
all-around 

(39.575 points), vault (9.875) 
and bars (9.950). As if all of 
that wasn’t enough, Zaziski 
was also substituted into the 
floor event at the last minute 
for junior Lauren Marinez, 
and subsequently placed third 
(9.900).

“My teammates talked to 

me before I went on the floor,” 
Zaziski said. “And I think that 
was really helpful. I was just 
ready for whatever happened 
and to do whatever was best for 
the team.”

Added Plocki: “Floor is an 

event that we’ve been trying 
to get (Zaziski) ready on. She’s 
done well at it in practice, but 
we’ve given her a couple of 
opportunities 
in 
exhibitions 

earlier this year and they didn’t 
go so well. So we just kept 
plugging away at it in practice 
and building up her confidence. 
We made a decision that we 
would see how the meet was 
going and where we were 
sitting. If things were looking 
good, we were going to change 
the lineup.”

But 
sophomore 
Emma 

McLean wouldn’t let Zaziski 
have all of Michigan’s glory. 

McLean excelled 
on the vault as 
well, 
tying 
for 

first place with 
Zaziski 
— 
not 

that 
Zaziski 

minded splitting 
a 
championship 

with 
a 
fellow 

Wolverine.

“I’m just glad 

that we all came 
up 
big 
today 

and won (as a 
team),” 
Zaziski 

said. 
“I 
didn’t 

really care about 
the 
individual 

awards.”

Senior 
Nicole 

Artz also earned a victory on 
the beam, tallying a season-high 
score of 9.925. Artz’s win was 
made more impressive by the fact 
that she was the only gymnast at 
the regional to score higher than 
9.900 in the beam event.

Michigan’s 
triumph 
in 

the 
Morgantown 
regional 

secured its spot in the NCAA 
Championships — which will 
be its 23rd appearance — in St. 
Louis, Mo. on April 14.

And 
if 
the 
Wolverines 

perform 
in 
the 
NCAA 

Championships like they did at 
the regional, Michigan will feel 
just as at home in St. Louis as it 
did in West Virginia.

Michigan sweeps Northwestern with 4-0 win

Before 
Sunday’s 
matinee 

against Northwestern, the No. 20 
Michigan softball team — including 
coach Carol Hutchins — seemed 
looser during warmups than before 
its other games. As dancing and 
trust falls commenced, the Alumni 
Band, stationed in the right-center 
field bleachers, played the “Mission 
Impossible” theme song. 

Their song selection foretold 

the story for the visiting Wildcats 
(1-5 Big Ten, 13-19 overall). Their 
mission to even ruffle the feathers 
of the Wolverines’ senior right-
hander 
Megan 
Betsa 
seemed 

impossible.

In the final slate of the three-

game series, Michigan (6-0 Big 
Ten, 26-7-1 overall) completed the 
weekend sweep with a 4-0 victory, 
its 12th consecutive win and 
seventh straight shutout.

Betsa pitched her own seventh 

shutout in a row, raising her 
scoreless inning count to 48. The 
senior fanned nine Northwestern 

batters while allowing just two 
hits and two walks. Though not 
her typical double-digit strikeout 
outing, Betsa didn’t appear fazed, 
eventually settling in during the 
middle innings.

Admitting that some of her 

mechanics were not their best early 
on, Betsa tried to find the “fast and 
fluid” attack of the strike zone that 
has made her one of the nation’s 
best hurlers. But with considerable 
adjustments from pitch to pitch, 
Betsa was able to find her rhythm. 
After squandering a single in the 
first and a double in the second, she 
retired the next 11 batters.

Prior to Betsa catching her 

stride, Hutchins made one of 
multiple trips to the circle — an 
unusual occurrence with Betsa 
pitching. She tried to calm her 
ace down and get her command 
back in check, focusing mostly 
on mentality over mechanics. 
Hutchins reminded Betsa that just 
because 
Northwestern 
already 

faced her Friday in a 10-0 Michigan 
win didn’t mean she had to try 
harder to be more effective.

“You don’t have to be better 

than zero. I don’t think you can 
be better than zero,” Hutchins 
said. “She’s a human, she’s going 
to have moments of doubt or just 
trying too hard. She wasn’t always 
in a good flow, but the fact that she 
responded was huge.”

Added Betsa: “My body speed 

wasn’t as good the first two innings. 
My arm speed wasn’t whipping. 
That was something that we talked 
about inning by inning, just staying 
loose, whipping my pitches, and I 
thought that got better as the game 
went on.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
offense, 

meanwhile, was better than zero, 
boosting Betsa with just enough 
run support to pick up the win. 
Steadily increasing its lead with 
one run in four straight innings, 
Michigan created more breathing 
room for its ace.

In the third inning, after a 

lengthy at-bat, sophomore catcher 
Katie Alexander hit a two-out 
single up the middle to drive in 
junior pinch runner Nikki Wald 
for the Wolverines’ first run. 

Junior first baseman Tera Blanco 
and sophomore outfielder Natalie 
Peters each tallied an RBI to 
increase the lead over the next two 
innings.

In the bottom of the fourth, 

sophomore second baseman Faith 
Canfield hit a long two-run homer 
to left field, only to have it called 
back due to Peters leaving first 
base early — an automatic out. 
The miscue negated much-needed 
insurance runs, instead leaving 
Michigan in a closely-contested 3-0 
battle.

“We had to celebrate (the home 

run),” Hutchins said. “She womped 
it, so we just had to say, ‘It is what it 
is. We’re ahead, let’s play.’ ”

The fifth inning saw Michigan 

load the bases on two walks and a 
hit-by-pitch, and senior shortstop 
Abby Ramirez added a fourth run 
onto the scoreboard with a sacrifice 
fly.

As much as they looked to 

be having fun before the game, 
Hutchins believes it didn’t translate 
to the game itself, where she 
thought her players got into their 
own heads.

“They want things to go their 

way, and I thought today they let 
the fact that things weren’t going 
their way just deflate us,” Hutchins 
said. “We’d go up to the plate and 
have an opportunity, (but) the 
person at the plate would have a 
poor at-bat and that would deflate 
us. Just have a good at-bat because 
if you hit it hard, we can all be 
excited about that, but we were 
pretty outcome-oriented today and 
that doesn’t really work.”

But while the entire team 

may have struggled with mental 
deflation, Betsa remained her usual 
confident self, and that proved to be 
the difference.

“I honestly just feel confident, 

and I think it’s true confidence this 
time,” Betsa said Friday. “In the 
past, I’ve said that I’m confident, 
but I didn’t feel like I feel now. … I 
feel like most people aren’t going 
to score many runs off of me, and 
when runners get on base, I pretty 
much know I can get myself out of 
a jam.”

BASEBALL
‘M’ routs Penn State 
to claim series sweep

One-third of an inning – that’s 

how long Penn State’s starting 
pitcher lasted on Sunday. 

In that short time, the No. 22 

Michigan baseball team tallied 
five runs against right-hander 
Eric Mock – and didn’t stop there.

In the final game of their 

series against the Nittany Lions 
(0-3 Big Ten, 10-16 overall), the 
Wolverines blew out Penn State, 
14-1. Throughout the three-
game sweep, Michigan (4-2, 
22-6) produced 39 runs, tallying 
an impressive run differential of 
30.

After surrendering a 1-0 lead 

in the top of the first inning, the 
Wolverines’ offense erupted in 
the bottom half of the first.

Upon being hit by a pitch, 

sophomore second baseman Ako 
Thomas advanced to second on 
an error by Nittany Lion first 
baseman Willie Burger. After a 
fly ball moved Thomas to third, 
the sophomore scored on a wild 
pitch by Mock.

Then, junior third baseman 

Drew Lugbauer ripped an RBI 
double down the right field line, 
scoring senior shortstop Michael 
Brdar. In the very next at bat, 
redshirt sophomore left fielder 
Miles Lewis hit an RBI double, 
scoring Lugbauer and making 
it 3-1. Following back-to-back 
singles by sophomore designated 
hitter 
Nick 
Poirier 
and 

sophomore right fielder Jonathan 
Engelmann, the Wolverines’ lead 
increased to four before the end 
of the inning.

After Sunday’s win, Michigan 

improved to 11-0 when leading 
after the first.

“I think in any sport, at any 

level, you want to get ahead and 
stay ahead,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “So it’s good that 
we’re getting ahead and staying 
ahead.”

In the third inning, Michigan 

extended its lead to 6-1 with a 
sacrifice fly off the bat of senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson.

After tallying another run 

in the fourth, the Wolverines’ 
offense exploded again in the 
fifth, scoring six more runs. 
The inning was highlighted by a 
bases-loaded line drive to center 
by Lugbauer, which Nittany Lion 
centerfielder Jordan Bowersox 
bobbled. The ball proceeded to 
the wall, allowing all three base 
runners to score and Lugbauer to 
advance to third. And after a wild 
pitch scored Lugbauer, Michigan 
led 13-1.

While the Wolverines’ offense 

received an all around effort – 
eight of nine starters scored a 
run and all nine reached base – 
Poirier stood out. The designated 
hitter went 3-for-3, with a walk, 
an RBI and three runs scored.

“(I) was just sticking to the 

approach that (Bakich) gives 
us,” Poirier said. “Just being 
relaxed, seeing the pitches and 
pretty much trusting our plan as 
a team.”

In a game that featured a large 

offensive 
output, 
Michigan’s 

pitching could have been easily 
overlooked.

Nevertheless, the Wolverines’ 

starter, 
junior 
right-hander 

Michael Hendrickson, recorded 
a career-high eight strikeouts 
over six innings. Additionally, 
the junior allowed just one run, 
one walk and three hits.

“Even in the run they scored, 

(Hendrickson) 
was 
making 

quality pitches,” Bakich said. “He 
was very efficient attacking the 
zone (and) he put the necessary 
zeroes up that we needed so we 
could separate offensively.”

In Michigan’s five games last 

week, it went 5-0, scoring 64 
runs. If the Wolverines continue 
to have that level of offense 
production, they will be hard to 
beat. 

New batting stance aids Christner

Kelly Christner’s new stance 

at the plate takes some time to 
get used to.

From the left-hander’s batter 

box, 
the 
senior 
outfielder 

starts with her bat out in front 
of the plate — almost as if she’s 
preparing to drop down a bunt. 
But then, just as the opposing 
pitcher is winding up, she pulls 
her hands back and waits for 
the pitch.

That approach, which is 

meant to improve timing, has 
helped Christner climb out of 
a brutal 10-game stretch, one 
in which she hit 6-for-29 (.208) 
with just two runs batted-in 
and no extra base hits.

“She went to it on her own,” 

said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “She went to it a 
little bit last year because 
timing is her issue.

“I moved her down because 

she wasn’t hitting well. If 
she stays consistent then I’ll 
certainly consider (moving her 
up).” 

Despite 
a 
team-leading 

batting 
average 
over 
.400, 

Christner was dropped down 
from the top of the order to the 
seventh spot in the lineup last 
Saturday against Penn State 
— a move that didn’t surprise 
the centerfielder even with the 
team’s triple crown in hand.

“I had some games when I 

wasn’t really hitting well and 
other people were,” Christner 
said. “(Hutchins) is going to 
move it around by who is hot 
at that time, so I wasn’t really 
surprised by it.”

But the relief of pressure 

that 
comes 
with 
hitting 

in the bottom third of the 
lineup didn’t help Christner 
immediately break out of her 
slump. In that series against 
the Nittany Lions, she was held 
to only one hit, finishing the 
trio of games 1-for-5.

Then, in a trip to Central 

Michigan 
on 
Tuesday, 

Christner 
finally 
broke 

through her slump. Setting her 
hands in front of the plate, she 
pulled back and blasted a solo 
homerun off the top of the right 
field-wall — her first extra-
base hit in over two weeks. 

Later in the game, she notched 
an RBI single to supply the 
entirety of the Wolverines’ run 
production in a 2-0 win.

On 
Friday 
against 

Northwestern, 
her 
rebound 

continued, as Christner plated 
four baserunners via an RBI 
single and double.

In her last four contests, 

Christner is batting .636 with 
six RBI and two extra-base 
hits — a stark contrast to her 
previous dismal stretch.

“My main thing is getting 

in my legs and having rhythm, 
and (the batting stance) really 
helps me with that,” Christner 
said.

Hitting 
close 
to 
.500 

with 
power 
through 
the 

first month of the season, 
Christner anchored the top of 
the Wolverines’ batting order 
early on, driving in runs with 
consistency from the third and 
fourth spots.

But with Christner in the 

seventh spot, Michigan has 
scored 50 runs in seven straight 
wins, proving her potency 
throughout the batting order.

Her 
production, 
coupled 

with the emergences of junior 
designated 
player 
Amanda 

Vargas and sophomore second 
baseman Faith Canfield, made 
Hutchins comfortable with the 
current lineup.

“This lineup has gotten us a 

lot of runs,” Hutchins. “She’s 
pretty comfortable down there 
— we’re hiding her. It’s nice to 
get in that part of the order and 
look who is up.

“I count on Kelly Christner. 

If the seniors don’t have good 
weekends, we’re not going to 
have one. Your best players 
have to contribute regularly.”

With the new mechanics 

at the plate, the consistency 
that 
Christner 
brought 
to 

the lineup early on seems to 
have 
emerged 
once 
again. 

And considering Michigan’s 
success with its current lineup, 
perhaps Christner is where she 
belongs.

It might look odd, but her 

new stance is what might help 
to carry Christner and, in turn, 
the Michigan offense.

Wolverines’ offense comes alive

In the last game of the series, 

the Nittany Lions put up a run 
in the first inning — attempting 
to 
salvage 
the 
weekend. 

Michigan had no need to worry, 
though, as it knocked in five 
runs in the first inning alone, 
and then nine more to take the 
game, 14-1, to clinch the sweep. 

The offensive burst was just 

more of the same from the 
Michigan baseball team as it 
scored a total of 39 runs this 
weekend against Penn State — 
not surprisingly the most the 
Wolverines have scored in a 
weekend series all season.

While Michigan has been 

impressive on both sides of the 
ball all year, its bats have been 
steadily hot as of late.

Entering the series against 

the 
Nittany 
Lions, 
the 

Wolverines were fresh off two 
high-scoring midweek games in 
which they decisively handled 
Toledo and Central Michigan, 
12-0 and 13-4, respectively.

“The 
more 
experience 

you can get, more reps, more 
live at-bats that you can get, 
the better you’ll be,” said 
sophomore 
right 
fielder 

Jonathan Engelmann. “If you 
take four, five games off, it’s 
hard to get back into a rhythm, 
so 
having 
those 
five-game 

weeks are really nice.”

In the past, the Wolverines 

have 
struggled 
to 
remain 

consistent all game, but the 
depth of the lineup has proven 
that they can continue the 
momentum from inning to 
inning — having scored in 15 of 
24 innings this weekend.

And in all three contests 

against 
Penn 
State, 
every 

Michigan player that stepped 
in the batter’s box was a threat.

In 
Friday’s 
10-6 
victory, 

the 
Wolverines 
tallied 
11 

hits. Engelmann, sophomore 
second baseman Ako Thomas 
and 
junior 
first 
baseman 

Jake Bivens were the most 
dangerous. All three had two 
hits on the day, batting eighth, 
first and sixth in the lineup, 
respectively.

Saturday saw three different 

Wolverines hit balls out of the 
park to contribute to a 15-2 
triumph. Junior third baseman 
Drew Lugbauer hit two over the 
wall — one even landed in the 
outfield of Alumni Field — and 
he picked up four runs-batted 
in on the day. Engelmann also 
got in on the action, hitting his 
first career home run over the 
left-field wall in the seventh 
inning.

But no home run was quite 

as exciting for Michigan fans 
than that of redshirt freshman 
infielder Joe Pace. Not only did 
he get his first hit in a Wolverine 
uniform, but he also sent it over 
the centerfield wall. He was 
swarmed by his teammates and 
met with wild cheers as he tried 
to re-enter the dugout.

“He earned that moment,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Erik 

Bakich. “That was everyone in 
the dugout genuinely excited 
for Joe Pace because he’s such a 
team guy. He doesn’t get to play 
much but he works just as hard 
as everybody else. He’s just a 
great kid, great person so for 
him to have a big hit like that.

“For his first career hit 

happens to be a two-run, two-
out, two-strike home run, you 
can’t script that stuff out any 
better. I’m happy for him.”

The bottom of the lineup 

impressed the most Sunday. 
Engelmann 
and 
sophomore 

designated hitter Nick Poirier 
each tallied three hits and 
one RBI. Even senior catcher 
Harrison Wenson, batting in 
the nine slot, singled through 
the gap between second and 
third base for his first hit of the 
series. 

“It’s just a matter of getting 

in every day and taking pride 
in the work that you do,” 
Engelmann said. “Luck favors 
the prepared mind and today 
we got to see that hard work 
come into formation and we’re 
happy that it came out that 
way.”

It 
appears 
that 
the 

Wolverines bats have come 
alive, as they are about to 
enter the heart of their Big 
Ten season. For Michigan, the 
next test will be sustaining 
the production and proving it 
didn’t peak too early.

Wolverines finally get to cut down net

DETROIT — The Michigan 

women’s basketball team has been 
in existence for 44 seasons. Prior 
to Saturday, the Wolverines — 
despite several NCAA Tournament 
and Women’s National Invitation 
Tournament appearances — did 
not have a banner in Crisler Center 
to show for those 44 years. Nor had 
they ever been able to cut down the 
net at an arena before.

That all changed with Michigan’s 

89-79, triple-overtime victory in 
the WNIT championship game 
against Georgia Tech. Starting next 
season, the Wolverines can look up 
in Crisler Center and see a banner 
of their very own, a tangible reward 
for over four decades of hard work.

“I think we had a refuse to lose 

mentality,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “They refused 
to go away and it was just awesome 
to watch.”

Though the Michigan players 

received trophies and exchanged 
hugs and autographs immediately 
after the game, the most exciting 
event for the Wolverines was 
cutting down the net at Calihan 
Hall. The Wolverines took turns in 
the first-ever net-cutting ceremony.

First up with the scissors was 

sophomore center Hallie Thome, 
whose heroics played a huge role 
in putting Michigan in the WNIT 
championship 
game. 
Coming 

into Saturday’s game, Thome had 
netted at least 20 points in three of 
Michigan’s five WNIT games.

Despite missing her first three 

shots, Thome once again proved 
indispensable for the Wolverines. 
She finished the game with 25 
points, including eight in the third 
quarter, which allowed Michigan 
to take a 43-42 lead into the fourth 
frame.

“I’m really proud of everyone, 

definitely 
going 
into 
all 
the 

overtimes and not giving up, and 
still giving the same amount of 
effort each time,” Thome said. 
“Coach Arico had talked about it, 
we ran so much during preseason 
and just how we can outrun them 

and keep pushing. If it’s a battle on 
the run, we’ll be able to make it, so 
I think it definitely helped in our 
favor at the end of the game.”

Yet if junior guard Katelynn 

Flaherty wasn’t mobbed by fans 
and reporters, perhaps she would 
have gotten first dibs at trimming 
the net. Flaherty was named the 
WNIT’s Most Valuable Player after 
scoring 21.3 points per game in the 
tournament and netting 27 against 
the Yellow Jackets.

While Flaherty, like Thome, 

struggled early in the game, 
she 
came 
through 
when 
it 

mattered 
most 
for 
Michigan. 

As 
the 
Wolverines 
trailed 

Georgia Tech 67-61 with 1:06 
remaining in regulation, Flaherty 
singlehandedly erased Michigan’s 
deficit with two 3-pointers to force 
overtime. She netted five more 
points in the overtime periods in 
order to ensure that she would have 
her turn with a pair of scissors.

“This is great,” Flaherty said. 

“It’s awesome to be able to win a 
championship and put your school 
on the map. This is the result of all 
our hard work all year whether we 

made the NCAA Tournament or 
not. It’s a great moment.”

Junior forward Jillian Dunston 

took her turn with the scissors 
between Thome and Flaherty. 
Although Dunston’s point totals 
in the WNIT were dwarfed by 
Thome’s 
and 
Flaherty’s, 
she 

led the Wolverines in rebounds 
through the first five games of the 
tournament with 41.

Dunston played no small part 

in 
Michigan’s 
championship 

victory either. During the second 
overtime period, she pulled down 
four boards and made both of her 
free throws, which propelled the 
Wolverines into the decisive third 
extra frame.

“I told myself my free-throw 

percentage this year was subpar,” 
Dunston said. “So I was like, ‘This is 
the last game. You have to go 2-for-
2.’ So I was locked and loaded at the 
line. Luckily they went in.”

But the most emotional player 

after Michigan’s win may have 
been senior guard Siera Thompson, 
who is the Wolverines’ all-time 
leader in minutes played. She 
lived up to her no-rest reputation 

Saturday, playing all 55 minutes 
and tallying 15 points, eight assists 
and four rebounds in the process. It 
was fitting, then, that she was the 
one dribbling the ball in the waning 
seconds of the game before tossing 
it in the air in celebration.

“It was surreal,” Thompson said. 

“You dream about that when you’re 
a kid — winning a championship 
in college, it’s great. It’s a surreal 
feeling I’m so happy. I’m happy for 
myself and my teammates and my 
coaches.”

Though 
Michigan 
is 

understandably 
proud 
of 
its 

WNIT 
championship, 
the 

Wolverines attention will now 
turn to the NCAA Tournament. 
Michigan made earning a bid in 
the tournament a top goal at the 
beginning of the season and was 
stunned when it found itself outside 
the 64-team field.

Yet whatever happens from 

now on, everyone who walks into 
Crisler Center will see a new team 
represented in the rafters. And the 
Wolverines will always be able to 
say that they got to trim the net 
after a championship win.

Then O’Neil elbowed her in 

the face.

Flaherty’s jaw dropped in 

shock and she looked over at 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico, who watched furiously 
from the sidelines. Flaherty 
pulled herself up and jogged 
down the court shaking her 
head to catch up with the play. 
As she cut across the top of the 
arc, O’Neil guarded her closely.

Flaherty had enough. She 

lowered 
her 
shoulder 
and 

knocked into O’Neil, who let 
herself fall and skid back several 
feet.

Flaherty earned her second 

foul, but didn’t look remorseful. 
She was having a tough time. 
The normally 20-point scorer 

had just seven points, and 
missed every field goal attempt 
in the first quarter. By the 
second 
quarter, 
the 
Yellow 

Jackets’ pep band was chanting 
“airball” every time Flaherty 
was in a scoring position, after 
two of her first shots fell short of 
the net.

“I was just frustrated at that 

point,” Flaherty said. “My shots 
really weren’t falling and then 
I had a stupid foul on the way 
back. After that my team talked 
to me and I kind of just settled 
down and that helped me get 
back into the flow of the game.”

Still, 
Flaherty 
found 
a 

different way to contribute for 
the Wolverines in her work from 
the free-throw line. She drew 
as many fouls as she could, and 
her strategy started working. 
She shot 7-for-9 from the charity 
stripe, earning more attempts 
than anyone on either team. She 
avoided attempting 3-point tries 
in favor of driving down low and 
drawing fouls, and attempted 
just two field goals in the entire 
third quarter. 

But with 5:08 left on the 

clock in the fourth quarter, 
the Wolverines trailed by four 

points and it was time to shoot 
again. Flaherty aimed from the 
arc and missed her first attempt, 
but after a hard-fought rebound 
by 
senior 
guard 
Danielle 

Williams, Flaherty was blessed 
with a second shot from the 
same location. This time it went 
in.

Flaherty’s 
confidence 
was 

back, and when Michigan was 
back in offensive range 30 
seconds later, she shot from 
beyond the arc and scored again. 
Despite her earlier shooting 
difficulties, Flaherty was tied 
with sophomore forward Hallie 
Thome for a team-high 19 points.

Despite Flaherty’s success, 

the Wolverines still trailed by 
one. Georgia Tech seemed an 
unstoppable force in the paint, 
while Michigan struggled to 
finish its shots. The deficit 
grew to five with just over a 
minute left, and a win looked 
improbable.

But Flaherty still had a few 

tricks up her sleeve. With 1:06 
on the clock, she launched a shot 
from several feet outside the arc, 
and it sunk through the netting. 
Just three points differentiated 
the Wolverines and the Yellow 

Jackets.

Then, with 10 seconds left, 

Flaherty did it again.

“How crazy of Kate,” said 

sophomore 
guard 
Nicole 

Munger. “That one three was 
NBA range, amazing shot, hand 
in her face. And then it was just 
like, ‘Wow, we’re alive.’ She kept 
us afloat. She kept us alive. And 
all we kept saying was just get to 
overtime, just get to overtime.”

Georgia Tech was not able to 

capitalize on its last-second free 
throws that could have given 
the Yellow Jackets a victory, and 
Flaherty found herself playing 
another five minutes.

“It was a big relief,” said 

senior guard Siera Thompson. 
“(Flaherty) is a great player. 
She loves taking big shots and 
we want her to take all the big 
shots. She delivers every time. 
We have all the faith in Katelynn 
Flaherty, and I’m so happy she 
hit those shots tonight.”

But in overtime, Flaherty 

missed her first 3-point attempt. 
Then she missed a layup, and 
then another. Yet sophomore 
forward 
Hallie 
Thome 
had 

picked up a layup, and senior 
Danielle Williams made a free 
throw, tying the single 3-pointer 
made by the Yellow Jackets. 
 

Flaherty had done her job and 
put her team in a position to take 
the game over.

The Wolverines went into 

double overtime, where Flaherty 
earned her last 2 points, helping 
to keep the score tied and 
send Michigan into its third 
overtime. The tired Wolverines 
outlasted Georgia Tech, scoring 
13 points in the final overtime 
to finally take home the WNIT 
championship.

Without Flaherty, Michigan 

could not have earned it’s first 
ever banner — so it was no 
surprise when she was named 
tournament MVP. 

“It’s indescribable,” Flaherty 

said. “I can’t put it into words 
right now. … We just really 
wanted to be successful this 
season. We faced a lot of 
adversity and had so many 
setbacks, so it’s incredible to end 
the season on a win.”

Wolverines wrap up 
season with banquet

The Michigan hockey team 

had its final official meeting of the 
2016-17 season at the Junge Family 
Center on Sunday. The Wolverines 
were honored with the program’s 
annual banquet at the Dekers Club. 

The banquet was an awards 

ceremony and a time to honor the 
roster’s six seniors — Evan Allen, 
Max Shuart, Alex Kile, Nolan 
De Jong, Kevin Lohan and Zach 
Nagelvoort — and reflect on the 
previous season.

Michigan’s season ended in 

the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament with a 13-19-3 overall 
record, and most speakers focused 
on the future of the program 
rather than reflecting on the past.

Michigan coach Red Berenson 

did not fail to acknowledge 
the 
team’s 
record, 
though, 

highlighting 
the 
improvement 

that would be necessary next 
season. Berenson did not comment 
on whether or not he would be 
returning as the head coach for the 
2017-18 season.

He announced that a meeting 

with Michigan Athletic Director 
Warde Manuel would take place 
later this week to assess the 
coaching situation and determine 
the plan for next year.

The honors were awarded as 

follows:

Carl

forward Evan Allen

Michigan remains 
undefeated in B1G

The wheels on the No. 9 

Michigan women’s tennis team 
just keep on rolling. 

The 
Wolverines 
defeated 

Wisconsin 
(0-7 
Big 
Ten, 

4-12 overall) on Friday and 
Minnesota 
(2-4, 
10-9) 
on 

Sunday. With the wins, the 
Wolverines remain perfect in 
Big Ten play, and now have six 
consecutive wins (5-0, 13-3).

The Golden Gophers saw a 

glimpse of hope after winning 
the doubles point in dramatic, 
tie-break 
fashion. 
But 

the Wolverines 
quickly 
thrashed 
any 

confidence 
that Minnesota 
may have had, 
winning every 
singles 
match 

to 
take 
the 

6-1 
victory. 

After 
beating 

Wisconsin 
on 
Friday, 
4-0, 
Michigan 

impressively dropped only one 
match on the weekend.

“We work on the doubles, 

and we take pride in our 
doubles,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “But with the 
format, it’s tough to win every 
doubles point.”

Singles play has been a 

strength for Michigan this 
year. 
With 
the 
wins 
this 

weekend it has improved to 
20-1 in conference action. The 
team looks strong from top 
to bottom led by sophomore 
Brienne Minor in the No. 1 
spot for the weekend. Minor 
appeared 
confident 
on 
the 

court and bounced back after 
losing the second set, to take 
the win 6-0, 3-6, 6-3.

“I think we are solid all the 

way down,” Bernstein said. 
“We have a shot one through 
six, and I don’t know if we’ve 
had that all the time in years 
past, so I feel like we have a 

really solid singles lineup.”

Junior 
Alex 
Najarian 

proved 
her 
coach’s 
point, 

providing stability at the No. 
3 spot. Najarian’s net play was 
flawless, and she used it to 
capitalize on two break-point 
opportunities, 
allowing 
her 

to take the first set, 6-3. After 
trading leads in the second set, 
Najarian broke serve to ignite 
a two-game swing, taking a 
6-5 lead by winning a crucial 
deuce point. Najarian secured 
the victory for Michigan by 
winning her match in a tie 
break 6-3, 7-6(2).

Najarian was 

conscious about 
the 
different 

weapons 
she 
used 
on 

the 
court 

in 
Sunday’s 

matchup, 
and 

although 
her 

serve was not 
up to her own 
standards, 
she 

managed to get 
the job done.

“Usually (it’s) my serve, but 

today it wasn’t very on so then I 
rely somewhat on my backhand 
and my volleys, just not my 
forehand,” Najarian said with 
a chuckle.

The Wolverines continue to 

improve as their season nears 
the heart of conference play. 
Taking one matchup at a time 
seems to be working, as they 
continue to ride their unbeaten 
streak. Yet Michigan will be on 
the road for three straight away 
matches, which could be a test 
of the strength of this talented 
team.

Bernstein, though, doesn’t 

seem overly concerned.

“We have a tough weekend 

coming up with three on the 
road, but I feel like we have 
played a really tough schedule,” 
Bernstein said. “The goal is 
obviously to get better and 
peak in May, so I think we are 
headed in the right direction 
for sure.”

For the Daily

“We work on 
the doubles, we 

take pride in 
our doubles.”
