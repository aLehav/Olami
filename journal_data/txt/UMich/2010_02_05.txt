ULTIMATE LATE NIGHT

In Obama's
budget, help
for students,
researchers

Budget proposal
would increase Pell
Grant amounts,
research funding
By BETHANY BIRON and
MIKE MERAR
Daily StaffReporters
University officials say they're
optimistic about the benefits the
University could see from Presi-
dent Barack Obama's recently
proposed budget, which includes
plans to increase funding for Pell
Grants and loan assistance, and
could mean more money for Uni-
versity researchers.
The $3.8 trillion budget for the
upcoming year, which Obama
released on Monday, calls to
increase Pell Grants to a maximum
level of $5,710 up from $5,550 this
year. In addition, the budget allots
$66 billion for research not related
to defense and development proj-
ects, a 5.9-percent increase from
the 2010 budget.
Pamela Fowler, executive finan-
cial aid director at the University,
said students would directly ben-
efit from the proposed increase in
Pell Grant funding.
"Any increase in Pell Grant

funding will positively affect UM
students," Fowler wrote in an
e-mail interview.
She added that though there
are over 4,000 University students
currently taking advantage of Pell
Grants, it's too early to determine
how many would be affected by
the proposed changes.
Cindy Bank, assistant director of
the University's Washington, D.C.
Office, said the increase in money
for Pell Grants, which provide
funding for low-income students
to attend college, will further aid
students already reaping the ben-
efits of the program.
"It will help all the students
who have Pell Grants," Bank said.
"Throughout all three of our cam-
puses, it' will greatly help those
students who have the most need."
Bank added that she was pleased
to see the president continue his
support for making higher educa-
tion affordable.
"It's great that there is this
commitment to increase the Pell
Grants," she said.
In addition to increasing fund-
ing for Pell Grants, Obama's pro-
posed budget would provide other
benefitsforstudents includingloan
assistance, United States Secretary
of Education Arne Duncan said
in a conference call with college

Housing considering closing
Betsy Barbour's dining hi

Students say closure
could hurt hall's
sense of community
By DEBJANI MUKHERJEE
Daily StaffReporter
To the chagrin of many stu-
dents living in Betsy Barbour, the
residence hall's dining hall may be
closed come next year.
According to University Hous-

ing spokesman Peter Logan, the
possible closure would reduce
Housing's operating costs by a
significant amount.
Every year Housing officials
revisethe budget and look for ways
to reduce operating costs before
presenting a room and board rate
proposal to the Board of Regents
for consideration, Logan said.
Though Housing officials typi-
cally make a final decision on the
Housing budget in March, Logan
said officials in the Division of

Student Affairs could decide the
fate of the Betsy Barbour dining
hall today, due to protests from
the residents.
' Logan said officials are con-
sidering closing the dining hall
because of the opening of North
Quad in the fall, which will be
located at the intersection of
Washington and State streets.
Betsy Barbour is a few blocks
away at 420 State Street.
University Housing officials
held ameetingwith Betsy Barbour

residents Wednesday night to dis-
cuss the dining hall's potential
closure. Residents in attendance
were opposed to the possible shut
down of the dining hall and said
it would hinder the sense of com-
munity that it brings to the resi-
dence hall.

Diagnosis trends offer look
at racial attitudes, prof.says

Metzl: Black men
first over-diagnosed
with schitzophrenia
in Civil Rights era
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
Current debates on the nation's
health care system have been
focused on the future. But for one
University researcher, it is the
examination of the past that is key
to finding solutions.

Jonathan Metzl, director of the
University's Program in culture,
Health, and Medicine, recently
wrote a book using historical con-
text to provide reasons for the
over-diagnosis of schizophrenia
in black men - a problem that he
says persists to this day.
Accordingto Metzl the trend of
over-diagnosis began during the
1960s and 1970s as a way to quell
civil rights era protest activity.
Metzl, an associate profes-
sor of Psychiatry and Women's
Studies, said the idea behind his
book, "The Protests Psychosis:
How Schizophrenia Became a

Black Disease," arose as he exam-
ined historical records from
the Ionia State Hospital for the
Criminally Insane. He said these
records show that black men were
increasingly over-diagnosed with
schizophrenia during the 1960s
and 1970s.
Metzl said he took this infor-
mation and examined how "the
diagnosis itself in this hospital
and in certain aspects of society
became racialized."
"I found that there was a pretty
dramatic transformation in the
demographics in not only who

City still waiting on Argo Dam decision

Doug Strong says
hospital wants to be
a leader in 'creating
the future'
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
Doug Strong, chief executive
officer of the University's Hospi-
tals and Health Centers, spoke to
a group of about 100 people on the

vital role the University's health
care system plays in bringing both
state and nationwide economic
growth, at a panel discussion yes-
terday.
In addition to Strong, panelists
discussed the importance of sus-
taining and innovating the health
care system at the talk held in the
Michigan Ballroom of the Four
Points by Sheraton Hotel in Ann
Arbor.
Strong said the University holds
a very strong position in the Ann
Arbor community and the medi-

cal world, stemming from the fact
that the University's medical cen-
ters employ 17,000 practicing staff
members. Because of this, Strong
said the institution has an imme-
diate responsibility to advance the
industry.
"Wehopetobenationalandstate

said. "And for us the future can be
a long time, but it also extends to

City Council sent
report to state office
lauding dam's safety
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
Daily StaffReporter
Though the issue of the Argo
Dam has been much-discussed
by the Ann Arbor City Council for
more than six months, the future
of the dam is still in limbo.
In response to concerns about

the safety of the dam brought
by the Michigan Department of
EnvironmentalQuality inAugust,
city council hired a consulting
firm to gather information about
the security of the dam. Though
MDEQ concluded that the dam
either needed to be removed or
repaired, the firm's report found
that the dam was safe and did not
need repairs.
On Tuesday, the council sent
this report to the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources
to receive approval to keep the

dam as it is.
Argo Dam was built in 1920 to
provide hydroelectricity to Ann
Arbor residents. Since then, it has
come to benefit residents in other
ways, mainly through the use of
Argo Pond, the body of water pro-
duced bythe dam's blockage.
Several local boating groups,
including the Michigan Men's
Club Rowing Team, use the
pond, both for competition and
for leisure. But, these groups are
in danger of losing their venue

Airplane terrorist giving ~
U. S. info to find his mentor

House of Reps.
faces tough vote*
over $1.9 trillion
additional debt

Democrats say
Obama was right
to handle case as a
criminal matter
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Nigerian suspect in a failed Christ-
mas Day airliner bombing turned
against the cleric who claims to
be his teacher and has helped the
U.S. hunt for the radical preacher,
a law enforcement official said
yesterday.
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab,
the 23-year-old Nigerian who faces
terrorism charges in the Christmas
bombing, has been cooperating
with the FBI for days, providing
information about his contacts in
Yemen and the al-Qaida affiliate
that operates there.
His cooperation talking about
U.S.-born Yemeni radical Anwar
al-Awlaki is significant because
it could provide fresh clues for
authorities trying to capture or kill
him in the remote mountains of
Yemen. Al-Awlaki has emerged as
a prominent al-Qaida recruiter and
has been tied to the 9/11 hijackers,
Abdulmutallab and the suspect in

November's deadly shooting ram-
page at Fort Hood, Texas.
The law enforcement official
would not say what information
Abdulmutallab provided, but al-
Awlaki himself said in a recent
interview that he and Abdulmutal-
lab had kept in contact. A senior
U.S. intelligence official said al-
Awlaki represented the biggest
name on the list of people Abdul-
mutallab might have information
against. Both spoke on condition of
anonymity to discuss the sensitive
ongoing investigation.
Abdulmutallab's cooperation
with U.S. authorities is at the cen-
ter of a political dispute in Wash-
ington. Democrats say it proves the
Obama administration was correct
to handle the case as a criminal
matter. Republicans accuse the
administration of leaking details
for political purposes.
Abdulmutallab agreed to coop-
erate after FBI agents flew to Nige-
ria and returned to the U.S. with
Abdulmutallab's family members.
In a federal prison outside Detroit,
Abdulmutallab's father and uncle
persuaded him to cooperate with
the FBI, according to a U.S. official
briefed on the talks who also spoke
on condition of anonymity to dis-

cuss the ongoing case.
A month before the attack,
Abdulmutallab's father warned the
U.S. Embassy in Nigeria that his
son might be dangerous, a warn-
ing that officials failed to connect
to other evidence that intelligence
officials had gathered. President
Barack Obama has said the U.S. had
enough information to prevent the
attack.
Al-Awlaki, who once preached in
mosques in California and northern
Virginia and posted fiery English-
language Internet sermons urging
Muslims to fight in jihad, said in an
interview released Thursday that
he taught the Christmas bomber
and supported his efforts but did
not call for the attack.
"Brother mujahed Umar Farouk
- may God relieve him - is one of
my students, yes," al-Awlaki said
in the interview, which Al-Jazeera
reported on its Web site Tuesday.
"We had kept in contact, but I
didn't issue a fatwa to Umar Farouk
for this operation," al-Awlaki was
quoted as saying.
Understanding Al-Awlaki's con-
nection to Abdulmutallab and to
al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula is
a key to the U.S. investigation of
the attack and its effort to disrupt

other plots.
On Nov. 11, British intelligence
officials sent the U.S. a cable reveal-
ing that aman named Umar Farouk
had spoken to al-Awlaki, pledging
to support jihad, or holy war. The
cable did not contain Abdulmutal-
lab's last name, an omission that
made it harder for analysts to con-
nect it to the warning his father
would make one week later.
The contents of the cable were
described by intelligence officials
who spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because they were not autho-
rized to discuss the matter.
There were other early warn-
ings, too. A U.S. wiretap referred to
a Nigerian being trained for a spe-
cial mission. And another intercept
mentioned "some type of operation
on December 25th," Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., said.
Awlaki's family and many mem-
bers of his powerful Awalik tribe
deny the 38-year-old is a member of
al-Qaida. They depict him as a vic-
tim of Yemeni and U.S. persecution.
The Yemen government, which is
increasingly working closely with
U.S. intelligence, is negotiating
with tribal leaders, trying to per-
suade them to hand over al-Awlaki,
tribal members have said.

Democrats passed
the bill through the
Senate last week
WASHINGTON (AP) - Facing
a politically excruciating vote,
House Democratic leaders are
counting on new budget deficit
curbs to help smooth the way for
a bill allowing the government to
go $1.9 trillion deeper into debt
over the next year - or about
$6,000 more for 'every U.S. resi-
dent.
The debt measure set for a
House vote yesterday would raise
the cap on federal borrowing to
$14.3 trillion. That's enough to
keep Congress from having to
vote again before the November
elections on an issue that is feed-
ing a sense among voters that
the government is spending too
much and putting future genera-
tions under a mountain of debt to
do it.
Already, the accumulated debt
amounts to $40,000 per person.
And the debt is increasingly held
by foreign nations such as China.
Passage of the bill would send
it to President Barack Obama,
who will sign it to avoid a first-
ever, market-rattling default on
U.S. obligations. Democrats bare-
ly passed it through the Senate
last week over a unanimous "no"
vote from GOP members present.
To ease its passage, Demo-
crats attached tougher budget
rules designed to curb a spiraling
upward annual deficit - project-
ed by Obama to hit a record $1.56
trillion for the budget year end-
ing Sept. 30. The new rules would
require future spending increas-
es or tax cuts to be paid for with
either cuts to other programs or
equivalent tax increases.
If the rules are broken, the
White House budget office would
force automatic cuts to programs
like Medicare, farm subsidies
and veterans' pensions. Current

rules lack such teeth and have
commonly been waived over the
past few years at a cost of almost
$1 trillion.
Skeptics say lawmakers also
will find ways around the new
rules fairly easily. Congress,
for example, can declare some
spending an "emergency" - a
likely scenario for votes later
this month to extend jobless
benefits for the long-term unem-
ployed.
And, indeed, there already are
exceptions to the new rules, such
as for extending former President
George W. Bush's middle-class
tax cuts past their expiration a
year from now. That would add
$1.4 trillion to the federal debt
over the next decade.
In agreement with Obama's
budget earlier this week, there is
no exception for taxpayers in the
two highest tax brackets whose
marginal rates are due to rise by
3 percent or 4.6 percent to a pre-
Bush maximum 39.6 percent next
January.
But some new White House
initiatives, such as doubling the
child care tax credit for families
earning less than $85,000, also
would have to live within the
rules, as would continuing sub-
sidies for laid-off workers to buy
health insurance - unless law-
makers make another exception.
The so-called pay-as-you-go
rules have been a mantra with
conservative "Blue Dog" Demo-
crats in the House, who insisted
they wouldn't vote to raise the
debt ceiling without them.
"We don't have a choice," said
Rep. John Tanner, D-Tenn. "We
are on an unsustainable march
toward a fiscal Armageddon."
Obama's budget projects the
government's debt doubling to
$26 trillion over the next decade.
It offers few solutions for seri-
ously closing the gap other than
promising to appoint a bipartisan
commission to come up with a
plan to address the problem.

The White House says Mark
A. Goldsmith was nominated yes-

seats on U.S. district courts. U.S.
Senate confirmation is needed for
the judges to take office,
Goldsmith has been on the state
court since 2004. Before that,
he was a trial lawyer with the

WASHINGTON
Obama to meet
with Dalai Lama
over China-U.S.
relations
President Barack Obama will
welcome the Dalai Lama to the
White House this month for a
meeting sure to enflame tensions
between China and the U.S.
Yesterday's announcement from
the White House, which had long
been expected, is the latest in a
series of blows to a relationship
the United States views as criti-
cally important. The U.S. wants
China's help in solving nuclear
standoffs with Iran and North
Korea and economic and climate
change crises.
China, which believes that shun-
ning the exiled Tibetan monk
should be a basic principle of inter-
national relations, was quick to
denounce the meeting.
Wang Baodong, spokesman for
the Chinese Embassy in Washing-
ton, said in an interview that China
has been regularly pressing the
United States on the Dali Lama,
whom China accuses of pushing for
Tibetan independence.

" Costa Rican voters appear likely
to elect the country's first female
president, a protege of Nobel lau-
reate Oscar Arias who holds a
nearly 20-point lead over two male
rivals ahead of Sunday's balloting.
Laura Chinchilla's election
would mark another political tri-
umph in the storied career of out-
going President Arias, who has
been regularly called on to put out
Central America's political fires.
Chinchilla was Arias' vice presi-
dent before launching her cam-

paign. Ifvictorious, she has pledged
to continue Aria's moderate free-
market policies in what is consid-
ered the most politically stable
country in the region.
Costa Rica "got on the right
path four years ago and now is the
moment to stay the course," Chin-
chilla said during a recent debate.
"It's not the moment for some
change that will take us down a
road we don't know."

10 American missionaries charge
with kidnapping Haitian children

Baptist missionaries
face up to 15
years in prison
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
- Ten U.S. Baptist missionaries
were charged withkidnappingyes-
terday fortrying to take 33 children
out of Haiti to a hastily arranged
refuge just as officials were trying
to protect children from predators
in the chaos of a great earthquake.
The Haitian lawyer who repre-
sents the 10 Americans portrayed
nine of his clients as innocents
caught up in a scheme they did not
understand. But attorney Edwin
Coq did not defend the actions of the
group leader, Laura Silsby, though
he continued to represent her.
"I'm going to do everything I
can to get the nine out. They were
naive. They had no idea what was
going on and they did not know
that they needed official papers to
cross the border," Coq said. "But
Silsby did."
Family members of the Ameri-
cans released a statement late last
night saying they were concerned
about their relatives jailed in a for-
eign country.
"Obviously, we do not know
details about what happened and
didn't happenonthis mission," the
statement said. "However, we are
absolutely convinced that those
who were recruited to join this
mission traveled to Haiti to help,
not hurt, these children."
TheAmericans,mostmembersof
two Idaho churches, said they were
rescuing abandoned children and
orphans from a nation that UNI-
CEF says had 380,000 even before
the catastrophic Jan. 12 quake.
But at least two-thirds of the chil-
dren, who range in age from 2 to 12,
have parents who gave them away
because they said the Americans
promised the children a better life.

The investigating judge, who
interviewed the missionaries
Tuesday and Wednesday, found
sufficient evidence to charge them
for trying to take the children
across the border into the Domini-
can Republic on Jan. 29 without
documentation, Coq said.
Each was charged with one
count of kidnapping, which car-
ries a sentence of five to 15 years in
prison, and one of criminal associ-
ation, punishable by three to nine
years. Coq said the case would
be assigned a judge and a verdict
could take three months.
The magistrate, Mazard Fortil,
left without making a statement.
Social Affairs Minister Jeanne
Bernard Pierre, who has harshly
criticized the missionaries, refused
to comment. The government's
communications minister, Marie-
Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue, said
only that the next court date had
not been set.
U.S. Ambassador Kenneth
Merten showed up after 5 p.m. out-
side judicial police headquarters,
where the Americans are being
held and where President Rene
Preval and top ministers now have
temporary offices because theirs
were destroyed in the quake.
"The U.S. justice system cannot
interfere in what's going on with
these Americans right now," he
told reporters. "The Haitian justice
system will do what it has to do."
U.S. consular officials have been
making regular visits to the mis-
sionaries.
On Wednesday, Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton called the
Americans' behavior "unfortunate
whatever the motivation."
State Department spokesman
P.J. Crowley said the U.S. was open
to discuss "other legal avenues" for
the defendants, an apparent refer-
ence to the Haitian prime minis-
ter's earlier suggestion that Haiti
could consider sending the Ameri-

cans back to the United States for
prosecution.
It's unlikely the Americans could
be tried back home, according to
Christopher J. Schmidt, an expert
on international child kidnapping
law in St. Louis, Mo. U.S. statutes
may not even apply, he said, since
the children never crossed an
international border.
Silsby waved and smiled faintly
to reporters but declined to answer
questions as the Baptists were
whisked away from the closed
court hearing back to the hold-
ing cells where they have been
held since Saturday. People ren-
dered homeless by the quake sat
idly under tarps in the parking lot,
smoke rising from a cooking fire.
Earlier, Silsby expressed opti-
mism about being released.
"We expect God's will will be

done. And we will be released.
And we're looking forward to what
God is going to do," she told APTN
before learning they would be
charged.
Coq complained about condi-
tions where the Americans were
being held. He said they are sleep-
ing on the floor without blankets
and aren't being provided with
adequate food. He said he had
delivered pizza and sandwiches.
Silsby had begun planning last
summer to create an orphanage for
Haitian children in the Dominican
Republic. When the earthquake
struck she recruited other church
members to help kick her plans into
high gear. The 10 Americans rushed
to Haiti and spent a week gathering
children for their project.
Most of the children came from
the quake-ravaged village of Calle-

bas, where residents told The Asso-
ciated Press that they ha ndedo scr
their children to the Af\rericarns
because they were unahJo to feed
or clothe them after tire erth-

Settlers' house

EU leaders: Obama's absence

to be evacuated at summit won't be a problem

in Jerusalem

Mayor agrees to
tear down Israeli,
Palestinean homes
JERUSALEM (AP) - The
Jerusalem mayor has agreed
to evacuate a Jewish settlers'
house built illegally in the heart
of a predominantly Palestinian
neighborhood - but also plans to
demolish dozens of Palestinian
buildings erected without per-
mission in the area, his spokes-
man said yesterday.
Sovereignty over east Jerusa-
lem and its Old City holy sites is
one of the most explosive issues
in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Evacuations and demolitions on
either side of the political divide
have sparked violence inthe past.
Also yesterday, a roadside bomb
exploded near a convoy of Red
Cross vehicles driving through
northern Gaza, blowing out the
windows of one car but injuring
no one, a spokesman for the group
said. There was no immediate
claimof responsibility.
Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat,
who opposes sharing Jerusalem
with the Palestinians in any final
peace deal, had tried to buck an
evacuation order against the sev-
en-story structure, built in 2004
in east Jerusalem's Silwan neigh-
borhood by an ultranationalist
settler group.
Buttheattorneygeneral'soffice
backed the order, and forced Bar-
kat to drop his resistance.
Barkat announced in a state-
ment released yesterday that he
would evacuate the structure,
named after the convicted U.S.
spy Jonathan Pollard. The state-
ment also said Barkat had been
"forced to take action to carry
out all the demolition orders in
the Silwan neighborhood."
The municipality said not all
of the 200 Palestinian structures
set for demolition were homes
but it did not have an accurate
breakdown.
Palestinians say they can-
not obtain building permits from
Israeli authorities, and argue the
planned demolitions are meant to
assert Israel's controlover the city.
"This is a provocation that
sabotages the peace process," said
RafiqHusseini, atop aideto Pales-
tinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

"Nopeaceprocesscansurviveand
no negotiations can begin while
people's homes in Jerusalem are
being demolished."
Jerusalem is one of the most
intractable issues in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict because of
the conflicting claims. Israel
annexed east Jerusalem imme-
diately after capturing it from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu claims the entire city as
Israel's capital, but the interna-
tional community does not rec-
ognize the Israeli claim.
The Palestinians want east
Jerusalem for their future capital.
The four-car convoy carry-
ing International Red Cross staff
was driving in Gaza toward Isra-
el's Erez border crossing when a
roadside bomb exploded near the
vehicles, said Iyad Nasr, a spokes-
man for the Red Cross in Gaza.
The foreigner staffers were
unharmed and dropped off at the
border post, Nasr said.
The blast, which took place
about half a mile (one kilome-
ter) from the frontier, ripped a
crater in the ground about three
feet (one meter) across and two
feet (half a meter) deep. An AP
reporter at the scene saw glass
from broken car windows scat-
tered on the side of the road.
Hamas security officials said
police pursued a car seen fleeing
the scene.
Therewas no immediateclaim
of responsibility.
A Hamas official, Ehab Ghus-
sein, said old Israeli ordnance
might have exploded, although
that appeared unlikely. The
Israeli military said it had no
involvement in the incident.
Palestinian militants have
targeted foreigners working in
Gaza in the past. .
The Hamas-allied Popular
Resistance Committees group
was the prime suspect in a 2003
bomb attack on a U.S. Embassy
convoy that killed three U.S.
Marine guards. That bombing
took place near the site of Thurs-
day's explosion..
Last June, Hamas security
found whatappeared tobeexplo-
sives buried in a sand dune next
to the route taken at the time by
former President Jimmy Carter.
It was unclear whether Carter
was the target.

European media
reading too much
into it, leaders say
PARIS (AP) - French Presi-
dent Nicolas Sarkozy and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel brushed
off President Barack Obama's deci-
sion not to attend an annual sum-
mit with European leaders while
stressing yesterday the importance
of Russia as a European partner.
A U.S. State Department deputy
briefingreportersmadetheannounce-
ment Monday that Obama would miss
the EU-U.S. summit in May that will
take place in Spain, which now holds
the rotating EU presidency.
Since then, European media
have been awash with commentary
wondering what the White House's
snub means for Europe as it strug-
gles to find a united voice in for-
eign affairs following the creation
of the new posts of EU president
and foreign minister.
"With the United States, I don't
understand the debate," Sarkozy
told a news conference with
Merkel after a joint meeting of the
entire French and German gov-
ernments in Paris.
"Where is the drama? Is that
our only problem in the world
today?" he continued.
Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero also
expressed understanding yester-
day for Obama's decision, telling a
meeting of the Atlantic Council in
Washington that European lead-
ers "do not think he has lost inter-
est in the EU."
Obama already had miffed
Merkel by skipping the ceremonies
marking the 20th anniversary of
the fall of the Berlin Wall in Novem-
ber, and she was more taciturn. She
said that along with Sarkozy and
other EU leaders, she would discuss
the issue at an informal summit in
Brussels next week.
Sarkozy indicated that Obama
might choose to meet with Euro-
pean leaders in the fall when the
U.S. president would be expected
to attend the annual NATO lead-
ers summit which this year is in
Portugal - a combined solution
the French leader said was a "rath-
er good idea."
"If the summit is in November
instead of May, it truly doesn't
matter. My feeling is that there
are too many summits. There are
too many trips. There is too much
time lost," Sarkozy said.
Zapatero, who spokebriefly with
Obama earlier yesterday echoed

that idea, indicating the timing of
the next sumnit would be based on
"content" and not a specific date.
"We will be holding an EU-U.S.
summit whenthe agendaso allows,"
Zapatero said. "By that I do not
mean dates, I mean the content."
The U.S. leader traveled to
Europe half a dozen times last year
and met European leaders at other
international venues, including at
the United Nations.
Sarkozy and Merkel stressed the
importance of their relationship
with Russia. Both Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Min-
ister Vladimir Putin are scheduled
to visit France in comingmonths.
The French leader said that he
wanted France and Germany to be
in total harmony regarding rela-
tionswith Russia, while Merkelsaid
Russia's relationship with Europe
was a "central question."

"We have to end the Cod iat,"
she said.
Sarkozy and Merkel er rrert

man leader's re electon.' they

Bring out the bins
'U' needs to increase easy access to recycling in Lawyers Club
S tudents who live in the University's Lawyers Club experience
elegant architecture, pristine surroundings and, apparently,
a surprising vacuum of recycle bins. Residents of the Law-
yers Club, a residence hall located in the Law Quad, are expressing
frustration over a lack of recycling options in their residence hall. In
attempts to explain the absence, administrators have offered excus-
es that simply don't fly. Recycling serves an important environ-
mental purpose, and the University needs to ensure that recycling
receptacles for paper are readily available in the halls and rooms in
residence halls, including in the Lawyers Club.

An immodest proposal

0

As reported in the Daily on Monday,
there are no recycling bins available with-
in the halls or rooms of the Lawyers Club.
Residents who wish to recycle must walk
their recyclable materials to a separate
location because there are no receptacles
in the actual living area. Students say
they are being discouraged from recycling
because it's simply much more convenient
to throw away recyclable materials like
plastic and paper in much closer trashcans.
In the past, the University hasn't been
blind to the value of recycling. The Ross
School of Business, for example, recently
introduced composting and recycling pro-
grams to reduce its waste. And in the 2010
College Sustainability Report Card by the
Sustainable Endowments Institute, the
University received an 'A' for its efforts.
Recycling at the University is an effec-
tive way to reduce waste and help the
environment. With landfills overflowing
and the U.S. annually producing 251 mil-
lion tons of garbage, according to a 2006
report from the Environmental Protection
Agency, trash is aserious problem. Recy-
cling also supports the environment by
reusing materials that take energy, natu-
ral resources and pollution to make. The
simple act is clean and efficient, and there's
no reason that it shouldn't be available to
students.
But the recycling problems at the Law-

yers Club are a black mark on the Uni-
versity's record. It's both surprising and
inexcusable that students living in the
Lawyers Club don't have easy access to
recycling options within their residence
hall. Students shouldn't need to search or
trek through snow to find a place to recycle
their trash. Recycling bins need to be avail-
able in prime locations, including students'
rooms or surrounding hallways.
Perhaps as pitiful as the absence of recy-
cling options at the Lawyers Club are the
excuses being offered by administrators,
who cite a lack of space and fire safety con-
cerns as the reasons recycling has been
neglected. But if trashcans can be provid-
ed within the hall, as they have been, it's
absurd to suggest that a recycling program
can't be implemented. To make matters
worse, the Law School has also neglected
to recycle the paper waste produced in an
office space it rents within the Lawyers
Club. Administrators at the Law School
and the Lawyers Club can't agree who is
responsible for overseeing recycling in
,the office - so recycling has simply been
neglected. But these excuses are laughable
and could be easily overcome.
The truth of th m terjt }gXputtjg gtt,
recycle bins in the Lawyers Club shouldn't
be a difficult process. The University needs
to stop its bureaucratic excuses and get
recycling into the Lawyers Club.

Last weekend, University Health
Service's peer sexual health
education group, Sexperteam,
presented its sec-
ond annual three-
day seminar called
"Sexpertise: Con-
versations about
relationships,
sexual health, and
sex."
Wendy Shalit,
author of "A Return
to Modesty: Dis- LIBBY
covering the Lost ASHTON
Virtue" and "Girls
Gone Mild: Young
Women Reclaim
Self-Respect and Find It's Not Bad
to Be Good," helped to launch the
weekend's events, serving as the key-
note speaker for the panel discussion
Wednesday night titled "No Strings
Attached? A Conversation About Sex
and Relationships on Campus."
Shalit's motivation in writing and
speaking about the status of sexuality
today seems to be twofold: she's both
urging young people to consider the
negative implications of the "hook-
up" scene (which refers to anything
from a long kiss to sex) and facilitat-
ing our realization of our own dissat-
isfaction with it.
After reading aloud the saddening
personal accounts of young people
who sought her counsel regarding
their feelings of worthlessness after a
nightofhookingup, Shalitspoke about
the pluralistic ignorance she's found to
be binding young people to the empty
reality of casual sex. According to her,
we're wrong to assume that everyone
around us is hooking up with each
other and probably even more wrong
to assume that those who are hooking
up feel satisfied by their hookups. She
reminded the audience of the impor-
tance of emotional intimacy in experi-
encing fulfilling physical intimacy and
asked,,rletorically, "What's thepoint.
of casual sex if it isn't any good?"

Although many of Shalit's obser-
vations contained kernels of truth,
something about the way she articu-
lated her message was off-putting.
Shalit calls for a reconsideration of
whether or not sexual prowess is a
means to empowerment. She seems to
have a visceral, negative reaction to
the relationship between sexual lib-
eration and personal empowerment.
This reaction, I suspect, follows from
an insight that a failure to honor the
intimately personal nature of her
body would allow a feeling of worth-
lessness to seep into her innermost
self-regard. She extrapolates from
that personal insight (one to which I
and probably many others can relate)
to prescribe that all people must
honor their bodies, with a behavioral
lifestyle of "modesty" and "virtue," in
order to be truly empowered.
Shalit seems to have mistaken the
foundational problem of the cyclically
devaluing hookup scene as being an
oversexed culture with no care for
the private realm. She sees a genera-
tion of young people who blindly fall
prey to the precedent of sexual free-
dom established in the '60s and - as
her narrative samples illustrated -
wake up the next morning feeling self-
loathsome and inauthentic.
That diagnosis, however, ignores
those who do have a foundation of
self-respect and aren't emotionally
repressed but still choose to engage
in behavior that Shalit may not deem
"modest." To imply that one must
either be emotionally repressed or
sexually repressed leaves everyone
powerless in some respect. While our
hypersexual culture certainly facili-
tates the devaluing of physical inti-
macy and the repression of emotional
intimacy, the primary cause of con-
sistent self-inflicted degrading sexual
behavior is a pre-existing lack of self-
worth and self-awareness.
The general insecurity that seems
to plague many young people features
a variety of symptoms including binge

drinking, bullying, eating disorders
and injurious sexual behavior. If, in
attempting to remedy this societal ail-
ment, we distract ourselves by focus-
ing too heavily on one of the products
of the insecurity, we'll allow the inse-
curity itself to continue masquerading
as other (seemingly more pertinent)
self-destructive behaviors.
Hookups don't
equal an unhealthy
sexual attitude.
Near the end of the panel discus-
sion, Shalit suggested that perhaps
people are reluctant to accept the
reality of a problem when no obvious
solution seems to be available. The
prospect of somehow lessening this
mass psychological handicap (which
could be a timeless characteristic of
youth) is daunting, but not impossible.
As Shalit noted, the necessary
first step toward solving a prob-
lem is accepting that it exists. This
would require a lifting of the veil of
pluralistic ignorance and an admis-
sion of the fear of vulnerability and
rejection that guides so many people
down a path of unfulfilling, mutually
destructive relationships.
Applying Shalit's rather abstract
conversation about sexual emotional
health to a Saturday night in Ann
Arbor is similarly daunting, but not
impossible. As you walk into the bar
or your friend's house or the frater-
nity house, make a commitment to
honor your own fragility and that of
those around you. Guide your actions
by a doctrine of respect. Modesty
may (or may not) follow.

Entering the Tyson Zone

Want to make $32 billion in a year? That's
more than Nike, Starbucks and Google com-
bined. Go to your local massage parlor, nail
salon, ethnic restaurant or men's club to find out
the secret. India, Thailand and the Philippines
know as well. What's the answer? Just join the
sex trafficking industry.
If you think this only happens in poor,
Southeast Asian countries, reconsider. People
are sold as sex slaves right here in America and
right here in Michigan.
For almost a year, Katya, a 20-year-old
Ukrainian college student, was forced to work
in Detroit strip clubs, according to a December
2007 MSNBC.com report. She was enticed by
two men who, using a waitressing job as bait,
lured Katya into coming to the United States.
Upon her arrival in the country, however, she
was imprisoned along with 15 other women in
separate apartments around Detroit. They were
threatened with violence to force them to work
12-hour shifts, earning up to $1,000 a night. But
they never saw a penny of the money. The men
controlled their every movement. These women
were imprisoned and exploited, without any
freedom or any way of finding help.
There are stories worse than this. Young
teenage girls are sometimes kidnapped from
their driveways and forced into sex slavery.
Girls are gang raped, brutally abused, threat-
ened to submission, treated worse than animals,
locked up in cages or dresser drawers during the
day and brought out to work entire nights with
their every action closely monitored.
These are modern-day slaves. Females are
exploited to work for sex without pay. You
would be shocked to find out that the U.S. is the .
second largest destination of sex trafficked vic-
tims. These people can be found in New York
penthouses, Nevada's brothels, California's
massage parlors and in our very own metropo-
lis, Detroit City's strip clubs.
Traffickers use children to sell sex in big cit-
ies and small towns across the United States.
Victims are tricked into the business through
jobs and educational opportunities or sold
by parents or spouses. Sex trafficking often
includes exploitation through prostitution,
pornography and stripping.
Some sources will tell you there are around
27 million slaves in the world right now - more
than at any time in history - making the trade
the most lucrative and fasting growing crime
industry in the world, behind the illegal drug

trade. Over 2.2 million children are sold into
slavery every year, though not all to perform
sex work. There are girls who start working
as sex slaves at the age of 10 or even younger;
for boys, the average age is between 11 and 13
years old. In India, 40 percent of prostitutes
are children ages 12 to 14. Every year, 244,000
to 325,000 American children and youth are at
risk for sexual exploitation and sex trafficking.
According to a 2006 U.S. Department of State
Trafficking in Persons Report, an estimated
14,500 to 17,500 victims of all ethnicities, rang-
ing from 12 to 18 years old, are brought into the
U.S. against their will.
But this doesn't have to continue. We can
be the new abolitionists of this century to free
these people. There is hope: There are already
victims who have survived, rebuilt their lives
and even reached out to help others suffering
as they once had.
We can raise awareness within our commu-
nities. No longer can people be ignorant of this
issue by thinking that human trafficking only
occurs in foreign places. No community is seen
as untouchable in the eyes of human traffickers.
We can change the conversation. Children
are too young to consent to sex so they should
not be viewed as entering prostitution, but as
victims of human trafficking. Victims should
not be punished;as is the law now. Those on the
demand side - buyers and pimps - are the ones
to be held responsible.
We should be on the lookout. If you suspect
slavery or exploitation, call the National Traf-
ficking Hotline at (888) 3737-888.
Be informed. Fact sheets and articles on this
issue are easily accessible online. Organizations
like International Justice Mission will send you
updates when you sign up online at www.ijm.
org/justicecampaigns. Go to the website now to
read and sign a petition asking President Barack
Obama to push for further change in this area.
We must reduce demand. Fight sex tourism.
Ask travel agencies, hotels, tours to sign the
Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children
from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism
at www.thecode.org.
And go to the League this Friday. At 7:30
p.m., Emmanuel Jal, a former child soldier
turned musician and human rights activist,
will speak about similar issues at the 6th Annu-
al Midwest Hip Hop Summit.

The Rip Torn story, currently
buried on the third page of
most national newspapers,
may very well be
the most under-
rated celebrity
scandal of all time.
It has now made its
way up the hierar-
chy of crazy celeb
stories with the h
likes of Eddie Mur-
phy receiving fel-
latio from a tranny LINCOLN
hooker, Rob LoweBM
filming a sex tape BOEHM
with a 16-year-old
and Kanye West's
infamous - yet underrated - "George
Bush doesn't care about black people"
comment. (You do realize he was talk-
ing about the sitting president, right?
Cajones.)
For those of you who don't know
who Rip Torn is or what happened, let
me break it down for you. Rip Torn is
a hilarious actor. You have most likely
seen him in films and would without
question recognize him. He played
Zed in both "Men In Black" movies,
he was the coach in the wheelchair
in "Dodgeball" and he played Artie
on what is in my opinion the best TV
show of all time, "The Larry Sand-
ers Show." Rip Torn is a legend. Some
may say a comedic God - he even did
the voice of Zeus in the Disney movie
"Hercules." Coincidence? I think not.
The question is, if he's so amazing
and so important, why haven't you
heard about what he did one week ago
today? And if you have heard about
it, why haven't you heard more about
it? Rip Torn is 78 years old, and last
Friday night he got incredibly drunk,
loaded up his revolver and broke into a

bank in Connecticut.
Pause for disbelief.
That's right. This 78-year-old mhan
broke into a bank with a loaded gun
while he was close to over three times
the legal blood alcohol level, accord-
ingto reports by The Associated Press.
When I first heard this story, I didn't
believe it. It's not that I didn't believe
it could have happened - I just didn't
believe it could have happened and not
garnered appropriate attention from
the media.
In my mind, this story has five
unbelievable parts to it, but it only
needs two or three of them to be a
front-page story. Part one: We have
a 78-year-old man. That's older than
a lot of your grandparents. Part two:
He's piss drunk. Part three: He's car-
rying around a loaded revolver. Part
four: He breaks into a bank. Part five:
He is a very well-known celebrity. Put
two or three of those parts together
and you have a shocking story. All five?
That's pure chaos.
lsat down with one of my friends to
try to figure out why this wasn't front-
page material. We determined that it's
because society has thrown Rip Torn
into the Tyson Zone. For those of you
not familiar with writer Bill Simmons,
the Tyson Zone is a group of people
who have displayed such craziness
that they can do anything, and if you
heard about it you'd believe it and
not be shocked. Other members of
the Tyson Zone include Mike Tyson,
Ron Artest, Gary Busey, Tom Cruise
and Flava Flav. For example, if some-
one said to me, "Yo, Lincoln, did you
hear that Ron Artest is going to fight
a caged lion on national television to
raise money for Haiti?" My response
would be "Dude, not now, I'm in the
middle of writing my column."

My friend and I determined that
Rip Torn is the first person in history
to be retroactively inducted into the
Tyson Zone. He hadn't done anything
too crazy prior to this, but once it hap-
pened it came as no surprise. Most
people's responses were something
like, "I've been expecting Rip Torn to
do this for years." I don't get how this
made so much sense to everyone, but
it did. Nobody seems to be surprised
by this story, but I think the idea of
anybody older than my grandpa rob-
bing a bank is nuts - not to mention
that the culprit is Zed from "Men In
Black."
The most crazy

celeb story you
haven't heard.
You may be asking yourself, "Why
would you write your column about
Rip Torn, Lincoln?" Well, that's a
valid question. The answer is simple: I
refuse to be a part of this conspiracy
to ignore Rip Torn and his ridiculous
behavior. The man was too much of an
influence on me as a child. I respect
him too much as a human being to let
this slide. Someone needs to put a foot
down and say: "Did nobody see that
this just happened? For the love of
God, someone please care." So I'll take
it upon myself to say: Did nobody see
that this just happened? For the love of
God, someone please care.

Gainsbourg
sees the light

"Maybe if you stopped hiding things like this from me, we could let you out of the garage more often."
Gibson's dull 'Edge'

Derivative story and
execution taint Mel's
return to the screen
By NICK COSTON
Daily Arts Writer
Imagine you're spending the day at an
amusement park. You've already been
on a couple awesome rollercoasters. One
had four loops in a row.
Another had a 90-foot
vertical drop. The third
ride, however, creaks
along at about five
miles an hour. There DarkeSS
are no twists, no turns, At Quality16
no loops, no shocks. It
wasn't a memorable ride, and Showcase
but hey, at least you're Water Bros.
not at work or in class.
The same is true of "Edge of Darkness,"
Mel Gibson's first starring vehicle since
2002's "Signs." In "Darkness," Mel repris-
es his patented anguished dad role from
"Ransom" and "The Patriot." He kills some
anonymous bad guys, and narrative incon-
sistencies are largely ignored. You'll be
perfectly content to watch how the events
unfold; -you just won't-eare why they're
unfolding.
Mel is Boston detective Thomas Craven.
After his daughter takes a fatal shotgun
blast to the guts, Craven begins the inves-
tigation assuming the hit was intended for
him. He soon realizes that his daughter
was working for a company with shady
business practices and sets out to avenge
her death and bring down the evil dudes

with a conviction that only a grieving
father can possess.
It's not entirely surprising that "Dark-
ness" would color so completely within the
lines, as it's helmed by Martin Campbell.
Campbell struck creative gold with 2006's
"Casino Royale," but has otherwise deliv-
ered a career filled with standard action
fare. He seems to value simplicity and clar-
ity over all other artistic tenets of filmmak-
ing: His camera moves in straight lines,
his editing is conventional and the per-
formances he gets from his actors clearly
separate hero from villain without much
engagement from the audience. These
things do not unmake a film - they merely
inhibit its reach.
Case in point: the opening of "Dark-
ness." The viewer sees grainy home video
footage of Craven's daughter as a toddler.
There's a timestamp in the corner of the
screen. The daughter addresses the cam-
era as "Daddy," so we know Craven is the
one filming her. But there's no cut to cur-
rent Mel watching it on his TV. There's no
off-screen dialogue about how it's time
to put the camera down. The scene sim-
ply switches to Craven at the train station
waiting for his now-adult daughter (Bojana
Novakovic, "Drag Me to Hell"). There's no
indication that this footage exists for any
-other-reason than to flatly-and lazily edu-
cate the audience of Craven's love for his
daughter.
This indolent footage is rendered fur-
ther useless by the validity of Mel's pained
performance. Few leading men can deliv-
er the blank face of loss like Mel, and his
admirable delivery conflicts with one of
the central problems of the film.
"Darkness" continually flips its emo-

tional output like a new driver alternating
between the gas and brakes. Cravenbreaks
into an apartment and has a body-slam
contest with the man inside, but imme-
diately thereafter stands solemnly in his
daughter's room, contemplating the brev-
ity of her life.
Compare such a sudden contrast with
the strength of the scenes in which Cra-
ven hallucinates that he's communicating
with a younger version of his daughter -
far more believable than the magical home
movies.
The second crippling error is Jedburgh,
the character played by Ray Winstone
("Beowulf"). Jedburgh is some sort of
shady federal cleaner whose every action is
above the law. He converses publicly with
both Craven and the ever-growing laundry
list of bad guys, from CEOs to senators to
CIA operatives, without any fear for his
security. It's never clear who he works
for, what his motivations are or what his
purpose is besides the maintenance of the
plot even when he, not Mel, concludes the
volatile events of the film. It's an enor-
mous oversight and an aggravating deus
ex machina, and the character is not even
close to being effective.r
"Edge of Darkness" could have been
worlds better. The loss of a child is a
bottomless,-well-of drama upon-which
filmmakers can draw and find new per-
spectives. Though Mel demonstrates
his own grasp of such drama, the film
around him alters its course at inoppor-
tune moments, leaving the viewer ulti-
mately apathetic to his behavior. And
speaking of Mel's behavior, if you're
worried about it, don't be. The film is
100-percent kosher.

Daily Arts Writer
Charlotte Gainsbourg was born to
make music. The songstress and occa-
sional actress is the daughter of two of
the 20th century's most
gifted European artists,
giving her the genes and w
the connections to fruit- iOtte
fully pursue her own
creative endeavors. Her GHlsbouI
father, the late French IRM
pop singer Serge Gains- Because Music
bourg, was one of the
most exalted figures in
the '70s Parisian rock scene. Charlotte's
mother Jane Birkin is equally talented,
renowned for her own musical and direc-
torial pursuits and as a frequent collabo-
rator with Serge.
With such a formidable artistic pedi-
gree, it's surprising that IRM, Gains-
bourg's most recent effort, is only her
third full-length album. The album and its
2006 predecessor, 5:55, follow a 20-year
gap in the singer's recording history. Per-
haps apprehensive of endless compari-
sons to her parents, Gainsbourg spent her
formative years pursuing creative works
outside the realm of music, before finally
returning to her singingcareer. Produced
- and almost entirely written - by Beck,
her latest record is an engaging collabora-
tion of talent and a testament to Gains-
bourg's own artistic roots.
A near fatality inspired Gainsbourg to
record her latest album. After a minor fall
while water-skiing, she suffered a brain
hemorrhage that nearly killed her. In
the ensuing months, Gainsbourg became
increasingly preoccupied with her recov-
ery, undergoing a series of magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scans to check on
her brain's recuperation. This brush with
death jolted the singer toward a period of
artistic creation, which led her to collabo-
rate with musical virtuoso Beck.
Drawing inspiration from the MRI's
hissing distortion, the record is an atmo-
spheric wonder that touches upon various
disparate genres, from rugged blues to
Francophone balladsto angstyrock'n'roll.
The album's title, IRM, is the French ver-
sion of MRt. While Beck's influence is
clearly present, Gainsbourg dominates
throughout and the album is decidedly
her own work.
A simplistic banjo chord opens the
album on first -thack "Master's Hand."
Despite the song's bluesy feel, it hardly
defines the rest of the record. Oscillat-
ing between Gainsbourg's breathy whis-
pers and distorted vocals, the song adds a

spark of experimentation to an otherwise
uncomplicated track.
The succeeding track, "IRM," takes
the album in an entirely different direc-
tion. Drawing inspiration from the
album's namesake MRI soundwaves,
this abrasive cut alternates between jar-
ring electro-scratches and Gainsbourg's
steady voice before erupting into a pure
atmospheric haze. The sharp juxta-
position of these introductory tracks
signals the album's diversity, prepar-
ing the listener for an electronic-tinged
trip through various musical genres.
Although the varied mix of styles can
feel abrupt at times, it allows the two art-
ists to explore the depth of their creative
potential.
The remaining cuts off of IRM exem-
plify Gainsbourg's and Beck's willing-
ness to experiment within the confines of
established musical genres. From boom-
ing rocker chords ("Trick Pony") to heav-
ily distorted sonics ("Greenwich Mean
Time") to wistful balladry ("In The End"),
the work crosses into various musical
planes, relying on Beck's inspired direc-
tion to guide the path. The two artists col-
laborate directly on the cutesy "Heaven
Can Wait," featuring a spirited duet that
recalls some of Elliott Smith's more opti-
mistic efforts.
Art from a near-
death experience.
The brooding "Le Chat Du Cafe Des
Artistes" is the sole song written entire-
ly by Gainsbourg. Sung in her native
French, the track combines her flut-
tery vocals with sharp strings, evoking
a caustic tension between the singer and
the instrument. Lacking Beck's signa-
ture electro-beats and distorted touches,
the track is drastically different from
IRM's remaining selections. Nonetheless,
Gainsbourg's exquisite voice still radiates
-without these embellishments, proving
that Beck's absence isn't necessarily a
detriment.
On her latest album, Gainsbourg has
finally cut away from her parents' legacy
and now stands as a musician in her own
right. While Beck's participation in IRM
is evident throughout, Gainsbourg's voice
gives the album life and stands as its most
important element. By exploring a multi-
plicity of genres, Gainsbourg has branded
herself as a multifaceted musician with
enormous potential.


Laughing at death's door

Midlake goes green on 'Courage'

By ANU ARUMUGAM
Daily Arts Writer
Theater is at its best when it can make
you die from laughter and maybe even laugh
at death. Tackling the issues of death and
the media's response to
it, the dark comedy "After After Ashley
Ashley," a play presented
by student-run theater Tonight
organization Basement at7 p.m.
Arts, successfully accom- and 11 p.m.,
plishes these two tasks in tomorrow
a sensitive and thought- at 7 p.m.
provoking piece. Walgreen
"After Ashley," writ- Drama Center
ten by Gina Gionfriddo, Free
follows the life of Jus-
tin Hammond, a teenager whose mother
Ashley has been brutally murdered. Ham-
mond's story focuses on his grief follow-
ing his mother's murder, juxtaposed with
how the media covers the tragedy.
"What it focuses on is how in our
culture the media has become a tool of
exploitation for tragedy. If something
terrible happens to a family, it becomes
everybody's issue. The whole nation
knows about it, and it gives people an
opportunity to adopt other people's trag-
edies," said director Emilie Samuelsen, a
Music, Theatre & Dance junior.
"You hear about a terrible news story,
and you feel bad. On the surface, you
(empathize), but when it gets deeper,
what you're really doing is taking some-
one else's tragedy and pretending it's
your own. That's kind of what the show
explores," she added.
"After Ashley" also revolves around
a memoir Hammond's father writes to
honor his deceased wife. However, the
father's portrayal of Ashley causes con-
flict within his son.
"It also deals with how people are
remembered after they have passed
away. One of the main frustrations that
(Justin) deals with is that everyone is
remembering his mother as this saintly,
cartoon version of who she was, instead
of recognizing her flaws and shortcom-
ings," Samuelsen said. "Is it better that we
remember them as these sugar-coated,
rose-colored versions of themselves or
should we remember them for who they

are despite their flaws?"
Samuelsen's point brings to mind recent
celebrity deaths. The faces of Michael
Jackson and Brittany Murphy were plas-
tered all over the Internet and dominated
the news upon their deaths. Despite their
eclectic media lives before their deaths,
Jackson's and Murphy's careers were por-
trayed in an extremely positive light upon
their passing. We weren't told to remem-
ber them for both their fortes and their
failings. This notion of looking favorably
upon the dead is just one of the concepts
that "After Ashley" seeks to explore.
So, as opening day approaches, how do
the cast and crew feel about bringing the
play to the stage?
"Everyone is really excited. The thing
about doing a theatrical production is that it
is stressful because it's a lot of pressure and
work, buteveryone is so invested in the proj-
ect that even though you are overwhelmed,
you are happy to be so," Samuelsen said.
Samuelsen hopes that students will
come and see the play for many reasons.
"Everybody loves a dark comedy," she
said. "It's the perfect balance between
funny and heartbreaking because it is
dealing with death. The characters are
Staging the media's
portrayal of death.
so smart and the dialogue is so sharp that
even though you are watching small, inti-
mate interactions between two or three
people, it's such smart conversation that it
really holds your attention. It makes you
think about things that you'd never con-
sider before."
Samuelsen's personal investment in the
performance is evident from her enthusi-
asm.
"For me, that's one of the main reasons
that I love theater, because what you're
doing is you're watching these stories
unfold that make you reconsider things in
your own life," she said. "Shows don't nec-
essarily aim to change how you live your
life, but what they want to do is make you
think about how you live your life."

an enjoyable listen, but it lacks

the overall effect is lack- bearded, pastoral bands like
rr. Throughout the record, Fleet Foxes and Blitzen Trapper,
music floats on, fluttering Midlake focuses not on man's
ly in the background and harmonious relationship with
r quite transcending pretti- nature, but on the struggle and

pursuit of meaning within its
boundaries. The record doesn't
try for the same commercial
appeal of Midlake's previous
album, but aims to convey the
trouble and hardship of "earthly
minds" interacting with a high-
er being (as stated on "Core of
Nature"). Still, the albumlacks a
big, sweeping chorus that could
garner Midlake any radio play,
like its superb indie-hit "Ros-
coe" did in 2006.
Midlake is already an excel-
lent live band, and maybe what
the songs need is an injection
of life on the stage. Until then,
the would-be mountaineers of
Midlake will probably still be
wandering through a pine for-
est, ever ruminating on their
next attempt to deepen their ties
with Mother Nature.

IFC sees record number
of winter rushees this year

Governing body
employs new tactics
for recruiting, sees
48rpercent increase
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
While manystudents choose to
go through the fraternity recruit-
ment process in the fall, Inter-
fraternity Council officials say
they've seen an unprecedented
number of rushees this win-
ter, stemming from changes in
recruitment tactics, they say.
According to Ryan Knapp, IFC
vice presidlent of public relations,
215 students accepted bids during
winter recruitment. This number
represents a 48-percent increase
from last winter semester, dur-
ing which 145 students accepted
bids.
Knapp, a Kinesiology junior,
added that 75 percent of students
who registered ~ for recruitment
decided to join a house, com-
pared to 61 percent last year. The
two fraternities with the high-
est number of new members are
Sigma Phi Epsilon with 22 new
members and Phi Gamma Delta
with 16 new members.
IFC President Michael Fried-
man said there are three main
reasons for the high numbers:
increased optimism of the nation-
al economic situation, the extend-
ed length of recruitment and new
dynamics of the rush process put

in place by the chapters.
Friedman, an Engineering
senior, said after IFC - the body
responsible for governing 30 fra-
ternities on campus - heardfeed-
back that the length of the winter
recruitment period was too short,
the originally three-day rush pro-
gram was expanded to four days.
"That gave our members more
time to get to know the potential
new members," Friedman said.
"They were able to talk to more
people and make the best deci-
sions."
Friedman said last semes-
ter the chapters had a semi-
nar called "Phired Up" which
encouraged IFC fraternity mem-
bers to search for new recruits
rather than simply waiting for
new members to come to the fra-
ternities. This gave them a head-
start for finding more potential
new members.
"I think today, given our cur-
rent economic state, everyone
is weighing things in terms of
costs and benefits," Friedman
said. "Our organization has a lot
to offer, whether talking about
academics, philanthropy and net-
working our organization brings
a lot to the table and we made
sure the people we reached out to
knew that."
Zach Schwartz, IFC vice presi-
dent of recruitment, also said that
tweaking recruitment allowed
the fraternities to have a more
successful rush season. Schwartz
wrote in an e-mail interview
that most of the chapters are
beginning to use more proactive

recruitment strategies.
"Whether it being meeting
potential recruits in the gym or in
class," Schwartz wrote, "chapters
are beginning to seek recruits
more actively during non-recruit-
ment periods, rather than simply
waiting for recruitment to begin
and recruiting those who walk
through their doors."
Schwartz, a Business junior,
wrote another way chapters
reached out to potential rushees
was by making incoming fresh-
men aware that IFC organiza-
tions have scholarships available
for their members, which encour-
ages them to join the Greek Com-
munity.
"There's no way to be certain,"
Schwartz wrote. "But I do think
that the increase in recruitment
numbers this winter are repre-
sentative of a larger trend and
will continue in the fall and lead
to more sustained growth for the
Greek Community."
Vinnie Caruso, vice president
of recruitment for Sigma Phi
Epsilon, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that his fraternity was bet-
ter able to cater to the needs of the
rushees, because he's a freshman
who went through recruitment
recently and knows from his own
experience what worked and
what didn't.
"After going through the
recruitment process," Caruso
wrote. "I was able to take things
that I liked and things that I
thought were lacking and use
them to tailor our chapter's own
recruitment plan."

Students gather to speak to company representatives in Pierpont Commons as part of the Winter Engineering Career Fair.

BUDGET
From Page 1
reporters yesterday.
Duncan said Obamabelieves that
stimulating the country's education
system will play a crucial role in
helping to improve the struggling
economy, which is why the budget
includes the Pell Grant increase
and funding for loan assistance.
"The president understands
deeply that America's economic
security depends on improving
education," Duncan said. "In ten
years, the jobs that employers will
be looking to fill will require a col-
lege degree or at least a professional
certification. We're convinced we
have to educate our way to a better
economy."
Duncan said that a major part of
Obama's plan is in its ability to help
nearly 1 million graduates to repay
their loans. It also provides the
opportunity to forgive their debt if
they enter a job within the public
service sector.
Under the Income Based Repay-
ment Plan, which was passed on
July 1 of last year, students entering
a public service job will pay a maxi-
mum of 15 percent of their income
towards theirloans and the remain-
ing debt will be forgiven after 10
years of work. Obama is currently
working to reduce the percentage
of income to 10 percent.
"We're trying to remove all the
financial impediments from bring-
ing talent into the public sector
and obviously we're particularly
focused in bringing the next gen-
eration of great teachers into our

country's classrooms," Duncan
said.
According to Duncan, the money
needed for this project will not
come from taxpayers and will not
add to the national debt. The funds
will instead be generated through
ending the federal government's
subsidizing of banks' studentloans.
"This bill would basically fund
our entire early childhood educa-
tion agenda and our higher educa-
tion agenda," Duncan said. "And
we can do all of this and support
these subsides without going back
to taxpayers for an additional dime
and without raising the national
debt at all, simply by stopping sub-
sidizing banks and investingscarce
resources into students."
While the increase in Pell Grant
funding and loan assistance will
affect University students, Sarah
Walter, director of federal relations
for research at the University, said
the increase in research spending
will directly benefit the University
itself.
"It's going to give some great
opportunities to purse competitive
grants in a wide variety of areas
that are high priority at the Univer-
sity like health care," Walter said.
The University Research Corri-
dor - a collaboration between the
University of Michigan, Michigan
State University, and Wayne State
University - will also benefit from
more funding, Walter added.
"The increases proposed by
the administration will largely go
to grant opportunities and also
opportunities for fellowships to
grad students which will create
opportunities for collaboration

between the three universities,"
Walter said.
Congressman John Dingell
(D-Mich.) wrote in an e-mail inter-
view thathe welcomed the increas-
es in funding to Pell Grants and
research.
"This increase in the maximum
Pell award will clearly extend the
buying power of this award, help-
ing more than 317,000 students in
the state to afford college," Dingell
wrote.
"This increase is critical as many
colleges and universities in Michi-
gan have had to increase tuition as
a result of declining state aid," he
added.
Dingell also highlighted his sup-
port for the increase in research
funding.
"It is my hope that the proposed
increases in research funding by
the Obama Administration will be
of benefit to UM, in particular, to
help increase the opportunities for
UM faculty and graduate students
to continue their work," he wrote.
Dingell wrote that he was espe-
cially pleased with the President's
proposal for an emphasis on fund-
ing for science projects inside and.
outside the classroom.
HIowevier,he emphasized that the'
budget proposal still needed to be
fully reviewed by members of Con-
gress and passed in both the House
and Senate before the plans set forth
would actually be enacted.
"I must emphasize here that the
Obama budget is just a proposal,"
Dingell wrote. "As the House and
Senate formulate the Congressional
budget resolution, we'll see what it
looks like in comparison."

matter what Washington decides
to do with that," she said.
Jean Chenoweth, senior
vice president for performance
improvement at Thomson Reu-
ters, also spoke on the panel. She
said that in the early 1990s, states
in the South and West saw the
best outcomes in health care, but
in recent years the Midwest has
become the primary leader in per-
formance levels.
Michigan is the leading state
"in having the most top perform-
ing hospitals," she said.
Publicizing the little-known
success of Michigan hospitals
should be a top priority, Che-
noweth added.
"In an economy that's so weak,
and particularly here in Michigan,
(few people know) how good the
healthcare is in this state - par-
ticularly in Southeast Michigan
and Ann Arbor," she said. "It's our
best kept secret and it's one of our
tasks to make that known more
broadly across the U.S."



ARGO DAM
From Page 1
if the city is forced to implement
MDEQ's recommendation to
repair or remove the dam.
In an August letter sent to City
Administrator Roger Fraser, offi-
cials from MDEQ wrote they were
concerned with the dam's struc-
tural integrity, specifically regard-
ing the security of the man-made
soil embankment that sits beside
the dam itself.
In the letter, MDEQ request-
ed the dam either be repaired
or removed by April 2010. In
response, the city hired the con-
sulting firm, called Stantec, to
gather data on the embankment
and its integrity.
Councilmember Mike Anglin
(D-Ward 5), said Stantec's find-

ings suggest that "the dam is in
good shape."
He added that the dam is in no
imminent risk of leakage or col-
lapse.
In light of Stantec's favorable
report and the cost to the city of
removing the dam, Anglin said the
dam is likely to remain in place,
though city officials can't make
a decision until they receive a
response from the Department of
Natural Resources.
With no official word yet, Char-
ley Sullivan, the coach ofthe Mich-
igan Men's Club Rowing Team,
said he's still concerned about the
fate of Argo Pond and of the impli-
cations for the rowing team.
Sullivan said the rowing team
receives limited funding from the
University because it is not a var-
sity team, adding that most of the
funding for the team's activities

comes from club members them-
selves.
If the dam is removed and the
pond disappears, Sullivan said
the team will have to commute to
Ford Lake in Ypsilanti, which he
fears would increase costs to the
point where it could put the team
in jeopardy.
"It would make it harder for us
to put together a team," Sullivan
said. "We'll lose guys because of
the cost."
Sullivan acknowledged that
the dam's removal seems unlikely,
however, and said if the dam stays,
the team can focus on competition
rather than costs.
"As long as there's an. Argo
Pond there," he said, "I think that
the issues facing our team are
only ones of being competitive
with people that we need to race
against."

DINING HALL
From Page 1
dents asked Coleman about the
fate of the dining hall.
In response Coleman said she
believed getting student input
will be essential to making an
informed decision about the din-
ing hall.
Coleman added that she had
also just discussed the topic with
E. Royster Harper, vice president
for student affairs, earlier in the
day.
Harper, who was also present
at the fireside chat, told a student
that she still had several concerns
about closing the dining hall for
the all-female residence hall.
"I'm really concerned. I'm
concerned about night. I'm con-
cerned aboutspace," Harper said.
"I'm concerned about the fact
that, while we're having some
conversations, it probably has not
been enough conversation."
Harper also said she under-
stands that closing the dining
hall could alter the culture of
comradery created in Betsy Bar-
bour.
"I do understand that that
decision is a big decision for us
and it needs to be made careful-
ly," she said. "I'm not sure we are
in a position to make that deci-

sion (yet)."
However, Harper said she
couldn't promise the dining hall
would be saved from closure.
"It would be premature for me
to say, 'don't worry, not going to
happen,'" Harper said. "I would
be surprised if we were there this
year, because we've not had the
full enough conversation about it
I don't believe."
"It's really important that the
residents speak their mind about
it and not experience the conver-
sation as 'it doesn't matter what
we say, you're going to do what
you want to do,' because that's
not the case," Harper said.
Nasiera Foflonker, an LSA
sophomore and Betsy Barbour
resident, said she opposes clos-
ing the dining hall, as it would
represent unequal treatment to
residents of different residence
halls.
"Considering the Barbour
dining hall only costs about
$400,000 to operate, and a new
dining hall in North Quad is tak-
ing $2 million to build, while it
will only-hold fifty more people,
it's obvious that there is a severe-
ly uneven distribution of funds
among the residence halls," Fof-
lonker said.
Betsy Barbour residents are
also worried about their safety,
as the dining hall's closure would

require them to walk to other
dining halls for dinner.
If the dining hall does close,
residents said they would prefer
a food retail establishment to
replace the dining hall. The stu-
dents said they would be willing
to work with University Housing
officials to negotiate a decision
that could work for both parties.
"We have been taking action,"
said Seher Chowhan, an LSA
sophomore and Betsy Barbour
-resident.
Some students who live in
other residence halls, like LSA
freshman Brad Damron, are also
upset about the possible closure.
Damron - who lives in Fletcher
Residence Hall - said he and
other Fletcher residents often eat
at Betsy Barbour.
"Every time I can't take the
time out to walk to another din-
ing hall, my parents lose that
money," Damron said.
Logan said housing officials
are also considering other ways
to streamline costs and are con-
sidering the students' sentiments
in their decision.
"We're looking at other
options," Logan said. "It is like-
ly that we may move in another
direction than Barbour."

DIAGNOSIS
From Page 1
was sent to that hospital but who
got diagnosed with schizophre-
nia," he said.
According to Metzl, the major-
ity of black men diagnosed with
schizophrenia were forced to
move away from the Detroit area -
where many of themwere involved
in civil rights protests and rioting
- to the mainly white rural com-
munity of Ionia, Mich.
During this time period the def-
inition of schizophrenia was also
changing, hesaid. The demograph-
ic that had been most frequently
diagnosed with schizophrenia was
white women, but during the civil
rights movement, black men who
were considered to be "violent"
were increasingly diagnosed with
the disease.
Metzl said misdiagnosis wasn't
only a problem in the Detroit area.
"American society came to see
schizophrenia as an illness that
was linked to bigger stories of anx-
ieties about the Civil Rights Move-
ment," he said.

This historical development
laid the foundation for the over-
diagnosis of schizophrenia of
black men today, which Metzl said
is still a problem.
"Minority populations, and par-
ticularly African-American men,
continue to be over-diagnosed
with schizophrenia and under-
diagnosed with illnesses like
depression," he said.
The era also brought forth the
idea of the "criminalization of
mental illness" and created a "stig-
ma against schizophrenia," which
are still implicit in modern society,
according to Metzl.
"All of these are directly related
not just to attitudes about men-
tal illness but also about race," he
said.
By examining history, Metzl
said he is also able to better under-
stand how these historically racial
stereotypes play a role in the dis-
cussions on health care today.
"Categories of health and illness
are incredibly political at differ-
ent points in time, so we can't just
assume that they're just totally
neutral categories," he said.
With the current health care

debate at the forefront of the
nation's political conversation,
Metzl said the public must be open
to different definitions of health
and illness and not just assume
that all "health is good" and all
"illness is bad."
"I think we need to pay atten-
tion to the different meanings
of health or illness in different
populations and really interrogate
what that means," he said. "We
shouldn't just assume we know
what it means."
Metzl said being open to dif-
ferent interpretations of what it
means to be well or ill might help
address minority populations'
"mistrust of psychiatry."
Though health care providers
have begun to implement some
"cultural competency" train-
ing, Metzl said they have "just
scratched the surface" and could
benefit from a deeper understand-
ing of the problems of the past.
"I feel like history provides us
with a really important lesson
about what happens when you're
not paying attention to the ways in
which culture is reflected in psy-
chiatric diagnosis," he said.

'M' holds on for midweek win

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
BOWLING GREEN - Two
goals, both scored during a five-
minute power play in the first
period,_
proved MICHIGAN 2
to be all BOWLING GREEN 1
the Wol-
verines needed to defeat Bowling
Green 2-1 at BGSU Ice Arena last
night, propelling the team to the
coveted fourth-place position in
the CCHA.
It all started when Falcon sopho-
more Brennan Vargas made a quick
cut towards the goal from the neu-
tral zone and the Bowling Green
forward received a crisp pass.
All that was between him and
the goalie was senior defenseman
Chris Summers. Vargas could spark
a great start for the Falcons -he just
had to get by the Michigan captain.
But Summers poked the puck
away, into the corner of the defen-
sive zone. Players from each team
started to pile up and chaos ensued.
Cheers roared down from the
crowd as shoves were exchanged,
and Bowling Green forward
Tommy Dee wrapped his arms
around Michigan freshman Chris
Brown and took him to the ice.
Dee received a five-minute major
and a game misconduct for his role
in the brawl and the Michigan
hockey team took full advantage.
Junior Matt Rust cleaned up a
rebound on a shot from the pointby
senior defenseman Steve Kampfer.
Then, Brown exacted some revenge
with awristshotfromthe lowerleft
slot. He was wide open and placed
the puck top shelf on the stick side
of the goal.
Michigan took Thursday's game
as a chance to wash the bad taste
out of its mouth against the Fal-
cons. Last time the teams played,
the Wolverines split a disappoint-
ing series with Bowling Green, the
11th-place team in the CCHA.

Freshman Chris Brown (pictured above playing in Michigan's lossto Bowling Green in November) scored one of the Wo ser-
ines' goals in their 2-1 victory at Bowling Green yesterday. Brown is third on the team in scoring this season.

Michigan led 2-1 entering the
third period at home on Nov. 20.
But the Falcons (3-14-4-3 CCHA,
4-19-4 overall) capitalized on two
power-play opportunities in the
final period, three unanswered
goals to win the game 4-2.
It was the only time the Wol-
verines (11-9-1-0, 16-12-1) have lost
a game that they led entering the
third period all season - they are
15-1 in such instances.
Play got sloppy after the first
period, but Michigan held to the
win in the defensive contest.
"A lot of turnovers, a lot of chanc-
es, I can't tell you much more,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson said.
"It was mostly a shinny game more
than a hockey game."
The Wolverines had to hold back
the Falcons, and had a little luck on
their side.

Junior goaltender Bryan Hogan
came out of the net to play a puck
and disaster almost struck the Wol-
verines similar to previous games
against Boston and Michigan State.
The puck bounced awkwardly off
of the zamboni door and right out
in front of an open net.
"It was a miracle they didn't
score onthat," Berenson said. "That
might've been the closest chance of
the period."
Berenson has been concerned
about his team's five-on-five play
lately, and it wasn't exactly an area
the Wolverines excelled in last
night. Michigan did clamp down
for the final forty-plus minutes
of the game to seal the victory -
something the Wolverines couldn't
accomplish two months ago at Yost.
"We're trying to win the third
period," Berenson said. "And we

didn't win it, but we tied it at least.
We didn't give up a goal. You don't
know what's going to happen. And
I feel fortunate to come out of here
with a win."
With the win, Berenson moved
into a tie for sixth place for NCAA
hockey all-time coaching wins. He
is tied with former Clarkson and
Boston College coach Len Ceglar-
ski with 689 wins.
But Berenson's accomplishment
was drowned out by the team's..
The Wolverines and Berenson have
made it clear that one of their goals
is to finish in the top-four of their
conference this season, which is
where they stand after last nights
win.
Now, the Wolverines head out-
doors and take on No. 3 Wisconsin
in the Camp Randall Classic on Sat-
urday.

Michigan's Vinson
becomes driving force
n her senior season

Basement-dwelling Northwestern ends
Blue s three-game conference winstreak

By CASANDRA PAGNI
For the Daily
Next time you hop on one of the
Michigan blue buses, check quick-
ly and see if the driver is decked
out in Michigan track and field
apparel.
"I drive the blue bus," redshirt
senior Shana Vinson said. "I drive
all the routes, really: commuter,
Bursley-Baits. I've been driving for
going on four years. It's one of the
better paying student jobs."
While she admits she doesn't
have much free time in addition to
working and training during the
indoor and outdoor seasons, that's
something the senior can live with.
Vinson, a Detroit native, walked
on to the Michigan track and field
program in her freshman year. As
a sophomore, she made the travel
squad and began competing, even
though her premier high school
event - the 400-meter dash.
"When I first actually started
competing," Vinson said, "I was
excited, new to the scene. We had
a lot of girls already on the team
who ran the 400. So, my sopho-
more year, I ran the 4x400(-meter
relay). I was an alternate (in the)
DMR (distance medley relay) at
nationals."
Today, the 400-meter dash is
again her premier event, but Vin-
son has tried a few different events
along the way. She regularly com-
petes in the 200-meter dash, the
400-meter dash, and runs the last
leg in the 4x400-meter relay.
This season at the Simmons-
Harvey Invitational, Vinson com-
peted in a new event, the 60-meter
dash, to prove to herself and
her coach that she "had speed."
Michigan coach James Henry said
he "would never let her run the
60-meter dash" as a regular event,
but admitted that her desire to
show versatility will prove valu-
able in her other events.
"She knows if she can utilize her
foot speed in her premier event,
she can make significant improve-
ments," Henry said.
Henry, who named Vinson as
one of three captains this sea-
son, said that he has seen Vinson
develop into an incredible athlete
over the past four years, adding
that the program will miss "one of
our greatest quarter-mile runners"
when she graduates.
"She already has the third-fast-
est time at Michigan ever (in the

400-meter dash), and she's only
a snap away from becoming our
best 400(-meter) indoor runner,"
Henry said. "I think she's also
overlooking the possibility that
she can become our 200-meter
record-holder as well. She's capa-
ble of being one of our best ath-
letes ever."
Breaking the Michigan indoor
record for the 400-meter dash is at
the top of Vinson's 'to-do list' these
days. The time she ran last week-
end at the Rod McCravy invita-
tional was 54.74. The school record
- held by Serita Williams - is just.
.34 seconds faster.
"It would mean a lot to me (to
break the school record)," Vin-
son said. "I've been trying to get
there. I feel like I've always had
the potential but this year I feel a
lot stronger and a lot faster. Right
now, it means the world to me. I'm
giving everything for it."
Some extra incentive for Vinson
to break Michigan's 400-meter
dash record is that the provisional
qualifying time for indoor nation-
als in that event is 54:40, just one
hundredth of a second faster than
the school record.
While Vinson may be deter-
mined to break the school record,
she doesn't let that imopact her
training on a day-to-day basis. Her
level head and lead-by-example
attitude was one of the reasons
Henry selected Vinson as a cap-
tain this year. She trains the same,
regardless of the outcome at a
meet.
"I just count every day as
another day for me to get better,"
Vinson said. "After I have a good
meet, of course I'm excited, but I
always think about what I could've
improved on and what I could've
changed in the race. It probably
gives me more inspiration to train
harder because I know I can get
there."
When asked if running profes-
sionally was in her future, Vinson
said she was unsure. Right now,
she's moving along with plans to
attend graduate school for pub-
lic health, but said that she will
always "run for fun."
"She is a perfect example of
someone that walks on to the pro-
gram and finds her spot the hard
way," Henry said. "She developed
into being both (a student) and an
athlete. The program is going to
miss someone that is a star in the
making."

EVANSTON - It was the Wol-

man
guard Dayeesha Hollins dribbled
the length of the court, passed it
off to sophomore forward Carmen
Reynolds who, unable to find an
open look, dished it to classmate
Courtney Boylan for a desperation
3-pointer that was tipped as it left
her hand.
The series of events epitomized
the Wolverines' 64-60 loss at
Northwestern yesterday - they
tried hard and came up just short.
"We drew a play up, and it didn't
work," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said. "I should've just
taken a timeout and organized -
and I didn't. And that, really, that's
the thing right now, that probably
bothers me more than anything."
Michigan's second loss to the
Wildcats (7-7 Big Ten, 14-9 over-

all) this season ends the Wolver-
ines' three-game conference win
streak.
Despite shooting 44 percent
from the court and 10-of-25 from
downtown, the Wolverines never
seemed to develop a rhythm
against Northwestern's bigger for-
wards.
"It didn't even look like we
played organized basketball,"
Borseth said. "We never really had
rhythm, the entire game. That's
the second time we've played them
and never had rhythm."
The lack of cohesion on offense
was largely a result of the team's
inability totake care of the ball. In
their win over then-No. 23 Penn
State on Sunday, the Wolverines
had a season-low 11 turnovers.
Yesterday, Michigan (5-7, 13-9)
committed 16 turnovers, including
nine in the first half.
The Wildcats mixed and
matched defenses all game. From
possession to possession, the
Northwestern defense would run
a full-court press, half-court trap
and drop back into zone. The var-

Wolverines look to avenge pre

The last time Michigan played
Wisconsin, senior DeShawn
Sims started his midseason tear
through the Big Ten schedule.
The forward led

the Wolverines
with 23 points
and 13 rebounds
in perhaps his
most impressive
effort of the sea-
son.
Unfortunate-
ly, the Wolver-
ines blew a lead
that they held for
the game's first
26 minutes. The

State in the heart of its Big Ten
schedule.
One of the biggest reasons for
the loss was Sims's lack of touches
in the final minutes. While the
senior dominated in a physical
low-scoring matchup against the
Big Ten's top defense, Michigan.
(4-6 Big Ten, 11-11 overall) settled
for low-percentage jump shots
when Wisconsin made it close.
The Wolverines started a three-
game skid that likely sealed their
fate as a middle-of-the-road Big
Ten team that may not make the
NIT.
Despite the disappointment in
the last five games, Michigan will
look for redemption this Saturday
when it takes on Wisconsin (7-3,
17-5), this time at Crisler Arena.
While the Badgers have always
played tough defense - they
lead the conference in the fewest
points allowed per game - the
Wolverines are a surprising sec-

ond.
Coming into this season, Mich-
igan was expected to win games
based on its three-point shooting.
But despite shooting poorly from
the field the Wolverines stayed
in games by holding opponents to
just 61.3 points per game.
But, in last Monday's contest,
Michigan started to show some
chinks in the armor. While North-
western didn't score much more
than the average allowed, win-
ning the game 67-52, it was the
way the Wildcats took over the
contest that was concerning.
"I think they continued to hit
shots," freshman Darius Mor-
ris said. "You would think they
would probably let up, but not in
their house, they just keep get-
ting wider and wider, and we just
didn't convert on the offensive
end."
Not only did the Wildcats just
pour it on from behind the arc,

shooting 50 percent, but they
Wildcats slashed through the
Michigan defense, scoring 28'
points in the paint.
"We got off to the bad start to
start the second half," Michigan
coach John Beilein said. "We still
hung with them because they
missed some shot or we played
good defense, but once they hit a
three and hit another three and
got a back door basket all of a sud-
den it was 12 or 13 and it was very
difficult for us to come back from
that far."
While Wisconsin prides itself
on fundamentals, this season,
Michigan hasn't been able to
pride itself on anything on a con-
sistent basis. Perhaps that's why
both these teams are heading in
opposite directions.
"They just do not beat them-
selves," Beilein said last time the
teams played. "They play tremen-
dous fundamental basketball."

Badgers went on
a 24-9 run to finish the contest,
giving Wisconsin the win at home
54-48. Michigan lost its next two
games to Purdue and Michigan
