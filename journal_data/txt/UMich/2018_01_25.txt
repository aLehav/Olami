Former 
USA 
Gymnastics 

and Michigan State University 
doctor 
Larry 
Nassar 
was 

sentenced to serve 40 years 
to 175 years in state prison 
Wednesday afternoon at the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
week-long 

trial. More than 150 survivors 
of 
sexual 
assault 
delivered 

statements over the course 
of the week, testifying to the 
molestation and abuse they 
suffered at the hands of Nassar 
under the guise of medical 

treatment over the past 30 
years.

Upon 
Judge 
Rosemarie 

Aquilina’s verdict, survivors 
shed tears in the audience. 
Aquilina was defiant. 

“You played on everyone’s 

vulnerabilities,” she said. “I am 
not vulnerable.”

Nassar will serve his state 

sentence 
after 
his 
60-year 

federal sentence on charges 
of child pornography handed 
down in December, Nassar, 
54, for a minimum total of 
100 years. Nassar also faces a 
sentence next week in Eaton 
County on three charges of 
criminal sexual assault due to 
treatments he administered at 
the Twistars gymnastics clinic 
in Dimondale, Michigan. 

Nassar, 
a 
University 
of 

Michigan alum, pled guilty to 
the criminal charges of first-
degree sexual conduct last 
November — the maximum 
sentence on his plea deal was 
40 years. Testifying in Ingham 
County Circuit Court this week, 
survivors revealed more than 
three decades of sexual abuse, 
some of them only six years old 
when they began seeing Nassar.

Rachael Denhollander was 

the first survivor to go public, 
contacting a reporter from 
IndyStar after the publication 
of their investigation into the 
abuse in US Gymnastics in 
September 2016. Her allegations 
began a new wave of reports 
and 
lawsuits. 
Denhollander 

delivered 
the 
final 
victim 

impact statement Wednesday 
to tears and applause from the 
survivors and their families 
assembled in the courtroom.

“How much is a little girl 

worth? How much is a young 
woman 
worth?” 
she 
asked 

Nassar and the court. “Every 
woman who stood up here, 
truly loved you as an innocent 
child. Really truly loved you. 
And it did not satisfy you,” 
Denhollander said. “And that’s 
a joy you’ve cut yourself off 
from ever experiencing. And I 
pity you for it.”

“And this is what it looks 

like when people in authority 
choose 
not 
to 
listen, 
put 

friendships over the truth, 
and refuse to hold enablers 
accountable,” she continued. 

“(We) are fighting because no 
one else would do it.”

Aquilina 
showered 
the 

hundreds of survivors who 
stood before the court with 
affirmation. 
She 
called 

Denhollander 
“the 
bravest 

person I’ve ever had in my 
courtroom.”

Before 
delivering 
her 

sentence, Aquilina addressed 
the survivors one last time, 
reminding them they are no 
longer 
victims, 
calling 
on 

them and anyone watching to 
continue to fight for change.

“Speak 
out 
like 
these 

survivors,” she said. “Become 
part of the army.” 

Following public pressure 

placed on the NCAA for a more 
comprehensive response to this 

abuse, members of the USA 
Gymnastics Board of Directors 
tendered 
their 
resignations 

Sunday, including Chairman 
Paul Parilla, Vice Chairman 
Jay Binder and Treasurer Bitsy 
Kelley.

Tuesday 
evening, 
MSU’s 

athletic department received 
notice 
of 
an 
investigation 

opened by the NCAA into the 
assaults “Nassar perpetrated 
against girls and young women, 
including 
some 
student-

athletes at Michigan State.”

MSU trustee Joel Ferguson 

shrugged at the idea of the 
NCAA investigating MSU in 
a 
Lansing 
radio 
interview 

Tuesday afternoon. Ferguson 
also said the trustees had

Michigan State University 

President Lou Anna Simon 
has 
tendered 
her 
official 

resignation, 
according 
to 
a 

statement 
released 
on 
the 

school’s 
website 
Wednesday 

night.

MSU 
Board 
of 
Trustees 

President Brian Breslin wrote 
the trustees approved Simon’s 
resignation. Simon has served 
as president for 13 years, and 
has worked at MSU for the last 
30.

“To the survivors, I can 

never say enough that I am so 
sorry that a trusted, renowned 
physician was really such an 
evil, evil person who inflicted 
such harm under the guise of 
medical 
treatment,” 
Simon’s 

statement reads. 

Simon says the scandal has 

been “politicized,” and it is 
“understandable” she is the 
focus of public anger and blame. 

A source told the Detroit 

Free Press potential interim 
presidents 
in 
the 
trustees’ 

succession plan include former 
Michigan 
Govs. 
Jennifer 

Granholm, James Blanchard 
and John Engler.

Calls for Simon to resign 

peaked after Nassar’s sentence 
— 40 to 175 years on first-
degree sexual misconduct — 
was handed down Wednesday 
afternoon. 
Simon 
was 
first 

informed of survivors’ reports 
and Title IX investigations into 
Nassar in 2014.

“I told people to play it 

straight up, and I did not 
receive a copy of the report,” 
she saidafter an appearance at 
Nassar’s hearing. “That’s the 
truth.”

Nassar 
molested 
and 

sexually 
abused 
hundreds 

of women and girls while on 
medical staff, both with MSU’s 
women’s gymnastics team and 

USA Gymnastics. 156 survivors 
delivered 
statements 
at 

Nassar’s week-long sentencing 
hearing 
in 
Ingham 
County 

Circuit Court, detailing three 
decades of abuse under the 
guise of medical treatment. 
Multiple survivors called for 
more accountability at MSU, 
and 
accused 
Simon, 
public 

officials and coaching staff of 
glossing over their reports. 

Rachel 
Denhollander, 
the 

first survivor to go public with 
accusations against Nassar in 
2016, blasted MSU’s handling 
of the case in the final victim 
impact 
statement 
delivered 

Wednesday.

“(MSU) did not listen in 1997 

or 1998 or 1999 or 2000 or 2004 
or 2014,” she said. “Victims 
were silenced, intimidated, told 
they were receiving medical 
treatment, and at times sent 
back to be further abused. This 
is what happens when a person 
puts their selfish desires over 
the people around them. This 
is what it looks like when 
institutions create a culture 
when a predator can behave 
unabated.”

Simon 
made 
brief 

appearances during the trial, 
but said repeatedly she did not 
want to take away from the 
survivors by attending the trial. 

“Lou Anna Simon, why are 

you not here?” survivor Alexis 
Alvarado asked in court Friday. 
“I do not want to hear another 
bullshit excuse from you.” 

Within 
hours 
of 
Judge 

Rosemarie Aquilina’s verdict, 
the 
Michigan 
State 
House 

of 
Representatives 
passed 

a resolution asking MSU to 
resign Simon from her position.

“We have lost confidence 

in the ability of President 
Lou Anna K. Simon to lead a 
transparent investigation, to 
implement changes that will 
ensure it never happens again, 
to protect students, and to 

MSU president resigns after months of scrutiny & scandal

ACTION 

...AND A VOICE AND

HAS HAPPENED IN 

THIS COURT.”

“more to worry about” than 
the Nassar case.

“This is not Penn State,” he 

said, referring to the school’s 
sex abuse controversy with 
ex-football 
coach 
Jerry 

Sandusky several years ago. 
“They were dealing with their 
football program. ... They’re 
smart enough to know they’re 
not competent to walk in here 
on this.”

MSU’s 
athletic 
director 

released 
a 
statement 

Wednesday 
annoucing 
his 

department 
will 
cooperate 

with the investigation. 

Both MSU — where Nassar 

worked as a gymnastics team 
coach 
and 
medical 
school 

faculty 
member 
for 
more 

than 20 years — and USA 
Gymnastics 
came 
under 

fire 
for 
enabling 
Nassar’s 

crimes. 
Though 
Nassar 

remained employed at MSU 
until early 2017, a Detroit 
News investigation released 
last week found more than 
a dozen MSU officials had 
been made aware of survivors’ 
reports in the last five years. 
Complaints 
were 
made 
as 

early as 1997, when then-high 
school student Larissa Boyce 

reported Nassar’s assault to 
Kathie Klages, the women’s 
gymnastics coach at MSU. In 
an interview with the Detroit 
News, Boyce told the Detroit 
News Klages told her she must 
have been misunderstanding 
what 
happened, 
and 

discouraged her from filing an 
official report.

Delivering one of the final 

victim 
impact 
statements 

before 
the 
sentencing 
on 

Wednesday, Kaylee Lorincz 
directly implored Nassar to 
tell the court who knew of 
his abuse, mentioning MSU 
president Lou Anna Simon. 
In 2014, Simon was informed 
of a Title IX complaint and 

police report filed against 
Nassar, 
though 
she 

claimed it was reported 
to her as an “unnamed 
physician.”

“I was informed that 

a sports medicine doctor 
was under investigation,” 
she 
said 
outside 
the 

courtroom 
following 

victims’ impact statements 
on January 17. “I told 
people to play it straight 
up, and I did not receive a 
copy of the report. That’s 
the truth.”

Lorincz asked Nassar 

use his time to speak 
before 
sentencing 
to 

provide the survivors with 
answers.

“Did Lou Anna Simon 

know? And lastly, did John 
Geddert know you were 
stealing the innocence of 
little girls in the backroom 
of his gym?”

In 
addition 
to 
the 

university’s 
mishandling 

of 
the 
reports 
of 

abuse, 
survivors 
have 

also 
criticized 
the 

administration’s behavior 

throughout the duration of the 
case and sentencing hearing. 
In court Friday, Boyce said 
she asked Simon to be there to 
hear her impact statement, but 
was told by Simon she couldn’t 
fit it into her schedule.

Following 
an 
emergency 

meeting on Friday, MSU’s 

Board of Trustees announced 
their continued support for 
Simon, saying they would not 
act to remove her as president. 
They also asked the state 
Attorney General’s office to 
investigate MSU to determine 
if any officials played a role 
in 
suppressing 
complaints 

against Nassar.

Trustee Mitch Lyons was 

the only one to call for Simon’s 
resignation. In a statement 
released 
to 
MLive, 
Lyons 

said he didn’t believe Simon 
had knowingly engaged in 
any wrongdoing, but needed 
to resign in order for the 
community to heal.

“While 
President 
Simon 

has done many great things 
during her time at MSU, this 
atrocity is simply too much to 
overcome and our institutional 
accountability 
has 
been 

compromised,” he said. “I have 
empathy for the position she is 
in but her legacy does not take 
precedence in this situation.”

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

Every Thursday, The Michigan 
Daily will feature a member of 
the campus community. This 
week we asked: What would you 
do with 24 hours to live? 

“I really think that I 
would just try and go 
about my usual life. I 
would probably want to 
spend it with my family, 
doing average things. 
I’d probably try and 
pretend it wasn’t my last 
24 hours.”

Project Moxie, a research 

project at the University of 
Michigan, focuses on increasing 
transgender youth access to 
HIV testing kits. The project is 
in its pilot stage, and working on 
recruiting participants.

Rob Stephenson, the project 

director and a vice chair for 
research in the Department of 
Health Behavior and Biological 
Sciences, said he hopes Project 
Moxie will help break down 
social and economic barriers 
that 
transgender 
individuals 

face when receiving health care.

After participants fill out a 

series of surveys, HIV testing 
kits are sent to their homes in 
an effort to help them avoid 
the stigma often associated 
with either publicly purchasing 
these kits or going into a clinic 
to get tested. Participants then 
schedule a time to have a video 
chat session with one of Project 
Moxie’s 
trained 
counselors, 

where they can test themselves 
in front of the counselor and get 
help building a prevention plan. 

If the test is positive, they will 
receive help on how to get care 
and live with HIV.

“Throughout my work, I’ve 

noticed 
that 
young 
people 

in particular face a whole 
range of barriers to accessing 
health benefits, and one of the 
things I’m passionate about 
is understanding how stigma 
and discrimination influences 
health,” 
Stephenson 
said. 

“If you just watch the news, 
you can see the incredible 
amounts of stigma experienced 
by transgender youth, and I 
thought this is a way to provide 
an intervention in their own 
home that tackles some of those 
barriers.”

Though 
Stephenson 

couldn’t say for sure whether 
participants in the study would 
have found alternate testing 
without Project Moxie, he did 
say 
participants 
expressed 

appreciation for the at-home 
testing kits.

“We send them an HIV 

testing kit which they could 
find themselves at CVS or 
Walgreens, so I always ask, 
‘Why didn’t you just do this 

yourself?’” 
Stephenson 
said. 

“And they say, ‘Well, we were 
scared, we don’t want to test 
on our own without anyone to 
talk to.’ Other common issues 
I hear are, ‘I don’t know where 
to go,’ or ‘I live in a rural area 
and there is nowhere to go,’ or 
‘I don’t want to have to discuss 
my behavior or my identity with 
somebody.’”

So far, the study has reached 

100 youth participants across 
the country. In order to recruit 
for the study, Project Moxie 
advertises on Facebook, Twitter, 
Instagram 
and 
Craigslist. 

Project Director Erin Riley said 
that of these various platforms, 
Instagram and Craigslist are the 
most effective. She said she was 
surprised to find Craigslist to be 
so effective.

“Craigslist is a bit archaic 

and it can be a little shady, so 
we didn’t add Craigslist until 
maybe three months ago when 
we were having some issues 
with recruitment,” Riley said. 
“But since we began putting up 
ads on there every day, we’ve 
gotten quite a few participants.”

LSA senior Michael Miller-

Perusse began working with 
Project Moxie in September. He 
discussed the importance of the 
study for its target population.

“I 
think 
that 
it’s 
really 

important, 
just 
the 
impact 

of having studies out there,” 
Miller-Perusse said. “We know 
that when we created this study 
that there was no published 
research examining the need 
for HIV testing for transgender 
men, and we’re aiming for half 
of our cohort to be trans men 
and half to be trans women. So, 
even just having this research 
out there is great, regardless of 
the result.”

Stephenson said if the project 

is successful, he would love to 
try and expand it.

“Right now it’s only a pilot 

study,” Stephenson said. “If 
it’s proven feasible, I’d love to 
scale it up. We’re focusing on 
transgender youth now, there’s 
no reason we can’t expand this 
to other vulnerable groups as 
well. People who, for social, 
cultural or economic reasons, 
don’t have access to services; we 
can take the services to these 
people.”

Tuesday 
afternoon, 
the 

University of Michigan’s Office 
of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 
announced Krishna Han will 
serve as its new associate 
director. 
Han’s 
position 

will begin on Jan. 29 and is 
currently being held by interim 
MESA Director Lihn Nguyen.

MESA Director Nadia Bazzy 

welcomed Han in an email 
to 
Student 
Life 
affiliates, 

and 
described 
Han’s 
past 

experiences 
working 
with 

multicultural 
organizations 

such as Black Student Union, 
Muslim Students’ Association, 
World Student Association and 
more. Han has also worked 
as the assistant director for 
Diversity 
Education 
and 

Cultural Programs at Bowling 
Green State University for more 
than five years. 

Bazzy’s email also described 

Han’s passion for ensuring that 
students from all backgrounds 
can access safe environments 
and equal opportunity.

“Krishna 
is 
passionate 

about 
transforming 
student 

experiences to build inclusive 
spaces 
and 
equitable 

opportunities for all and brings 
nearly a decade of experience 
working with minority groups 
in student life and university 
administration both nationally 
and 
internationally,” 
Bazzy 

wrote. “He describes himself as 
a professionally trained Social 
Environmentalist who fell in 
love with student affairs.”

However, Han’s appointment 

was not without controversy. 
The 
hiring 
process, 
which 

began in December, faced a 
boycott from several student 
organizations, such as La Casa 
and 
the 
Muslim 
Students’ 

Association, after individuals 
from the Latino community 
criticized MESA for the lack 
of Latino representation in the 
search for the new associate 
director.

An earlier statement from the 

Latinx Alliance for Community 
Action, Support, and Advocacy 
pointed out the absence of 
any Latino candidates from 
consideration.

“Members 
of 
the 
La 

Casa board were invited to 
participate in student sessions 
for the hiring of candidates for 
the Associate Director position. 
None of the candidates are 
Latinx individuals and across 
all of their cover letters and 
resumes, 
Latinx 
students 

were only mentioned by one 
candidate in a singular past 
experience,” 
the 
statement 

reads.

Yezeñia Sandoval, external 

director 
for 
La 
Casa, 

explained in an email to The 
Michigan 
Daily 
that 
while 

the organization fostered no 
resentment toward Han, they 
were disappointed with the 
inattention given to Latino 
input.

“La 
Casa 
is 
deeply 

disappointed to see MESA’s 
disregard for the Latinx voice 
in this hiring,” Sandoval wrote. 
“Without the Latinx voice at 
the table, along with other 
important voices from minority 
communities, 
MESA 
should 

have reconsidered its hiring 
practices, including its pool 
of applicants and job posting 
locations. This is not a personal 
attack on the person hired 
or their qualifications, but it 
creates a pattern of untouched 
potential 
in 
Latinx 
hiring 

pools.”

Sandoval 
furthered 
this 

sentiment by discussing how 
excluding members from the 
Latino community contradicts 
the efforts of the University to 
increase diversity. Enrollment 
reports released last semester 
showed Latino students make 
up about 6 percent of the 
student body. 

“The diversity the school 

seeks 
to 
achieve 
must 
go 

beyond 
proclamations 
of 

support.” 
Sandoval 
wrote. 

The University of Michigan’s 

Office 
for 
Institutional 

Equity 
released 
its 
annual 

reportconcerning 
prohibited 

student conduct on Wednesday. 
The report details outcomes of 
all investigations carried out by 
the OIE under the direction of 
Pamela Heatlie, the University’s 
Title IX coordinator and senior 
director of OIE.

“U-M encourages individuals 

to report misconduct to the 
University and, if the behavior 
is criminal in nature, to law 
enforcement,” Heatlie said in a 
University press release. “We 
are deeply invested in providing 
resources and support as well as 
addressing these issues through 
a fair and effective process.” 

The 2017 investigation found 

a 40 percent increase from 2016 
in the number of misconduct 
reports filed. The OIE received 
218 reports of prohibited conduct 
between July 2016 and June 2017, 
and 157 reports the previous 
year. The OIE conducted 28 
investigations in this period, up 
from 18 in the 2015-2016 report.

The OIE concluded after the 

28 investigations that eight policy 

violations had occurred over the 
past year: Five sexual assaults, 
two incidents of stalking and a 
violation of interim measures. 
The report stated the OIE carried 
out disciplinary action for these 
violations, including educational 
measures, 
employment 

restriction, 
suspension 
and 

expulsion.

The 
increase 
in 
reports 

could be partially due to the 
broadening of the University 
policy’s definition of misconduct. 
As 
of 
last 
year, 
prohibited 

conduct now includes intimate 
partner violence, gender-based 
harassment 
and 
violation 

of 
interim 
measures. 
These 

collectively 
counted 
for 
15 

percent of the reported incidents 
last year, or about 30 reports. 
This indicates that reports still 
surpassed the previous year’s 
number, despite the newly added 
categories.

 Heatlie, however, believes 

this change is due to increased 
awareness 
of 
gender-based 

discrimination and misconduct 
rather than a rise in the actual 
conduct on campus.

“We believe that this increase 

is 
the 
result 
of 
enhanced 

awareness on campus of these 
issues 
and 
how 
to 
report 

concerns, as well as the addition 

of new types of allegations now 
covered under the policy that 
were previously addressed under 
different 
university 
policies,” 

Heatlie said in the release.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said though there is 
no way to determine a definitive 
cause for the increase in reports, 
an 
increase 
isn’t 
inherently 

negative — an increase can 
signify heightened support for 
survivors and more awareness 
of the University’s system for 
investigating assault. 

“Reports go up each year, but 

that is possibly a good sign,” 
Fitzgerald said in an interview 
with The Daily.

After the policy revision in 

July 2016, the Sexual Assault 
Awareness 
and 
Prevention 

Center began a campus-wide 
campaign 
called 
“Start 
by 

Believing.” It aimed to increase 
awareness of sexual misconduct 
as well as support and reporting 
resources. It is likely that both 
factors influenced the increase 
in reporting over the following 
year.

Former 
SAPAC 
Volunteer 

Coordinator Laura Meyer was 
a part of the campaign. She 
expressed her confidence in 
the program and its work in an 
April 2016 interview about their 

efforts.

“There is a generally greater 

awareness of SAPAC and its 
services on campus when we 
are out in the community, and 
the volunteer coordinators have 
received even more outreach 
from community members and 
organizations who are eager to 
partner with SAPAC,” Meyer 
said.

Meyer 
also 
encouraged 

students to take advantage of 
the resources available through 
SAPAC 
and 
other 
campus 

organizations, 
specifically 

commending the Peer Education 
and 
Bystander 
Intervention 

and 
Community 
Engagement 

programs, 
which 
work 
to 

engage and educate students 
on sexual assault awareness 
and prevention. She also named 
Know Your IX, an education and 
advocacy group focused on Title 
IX, as an excellent source for 
information.

“Students should be ready 

to engage their communities 
in conversations about sexual 
assault 
and 
sexual 
violence 

by believing and supporting 
survivors, centering the voices 
of survivors, and respecting the 
agency and choices of survivors,” 
Meyer said.

lead Michigan State University 
forward,” the House resolution, 
supported by House Speaker 
Tom Leonard, reads.

Statements 
from 
MSU’s 

trustees have been conflicting 
in the last week. Though the 
board publicly renewed their 

trust in Simon’s leadership 
Friday 
afternoon, 
trustees 

Dianne 
Byrum 
and 
Michel 

Lyons 
called 
for 
Simon’s 

resignation Wednesday. 

“I support the resignation 

of President Simon, effective 
immediately, and I support the 
investigation by the Attorney 
General that will provide a full 
accounting of what happened 
and take an important step 
toward restoring trust, which 

has 
understandably 
been 

shaken,” Byrum wrote in her 
statement.

Vice Chair of the board of 

trustees Joel Ferguson affirmed 
his faith in Simon on a Lansing 
radio show WVFN, citing her 
strong fundraisers skills. 

“I mean, when you go to the 

basketball game, you walk into 
the new Breslin [Center], and 
the person who hustled and got 
all those major donors to give 

money was Lou Anna Simon,” 
Ferguson said in the interview.

In the interview Ferguson 

was quick to discredit the 
possibility of the NCAA getting 
involved. 

“To do what?” he said. “This 

is not Penn State. They were 
dealing 
with 
their 
football 

program. They’re smart enough 
to know they’re not competent 
to walk in here on this.”

The 
NCAA 
opened 
an 

investigation 
into 
Michigan 

State’s handling of the Nassar 
investigation later that day. 

Sens. 
Debbie 
Stabenow, 

D-Mich., 
and 
Gary 
Peters, 

D-Mich., released statements 
echoing 
calls 
for 
Simon’s 

resignation Wednesday as well. 

“It has become clear that 

the leadership at Michigan 
State University has failed to 
adequately prevent, address or 
respond to the victimization 

of young women and girls on 
its campus, and the crisis at 
MSU continues despite today’s 
verdict,” 
Peters’ 
statement 

reads. 
“Michigan 
State 

University has a long way to 
go in rebuilding trust with 
its students, athletes, faculty, 
alumni and the entire state 
of Michigan. To do so, it must 
have new leadership.”

T 

he recent passing 
of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act has 

been proclaimed as one of 
President Donald Trump’s 
greatest achievements since 
entering the White House 
last year. The bill is a major 
legislative 
win 
for 
fiscal 

conservatives who advocate 
for low taxes and minimal 
government spending.

Americans across the board 

will see a reduction in the 
taxes that come out of their 
regular paychecks, but the 
wealthiest citizens will reap 
the greatest benefits from 
the bill. Besides individual 
income tax cuts, the bill 
consequentially 
impacted 

the private sector with its 
substantial reduction in the 
corporate income tax rate, 
from 35 percent to 21 percent.

The tax cuts were touted 

by 
Republicans 
as 
the 

most effective way to spur 
economic 
growth 
in 
the 

United States. The private 
sector, along with wealthy 
Americans, 
are 
expected 

to invest their tax breaks, 
thus propelling the economy 
forward. Tax investments at 
the top then trickle down to 
affect the broader economy. 
This idea that the private 
sector 
and 
the 
wealthy 

have the power and scale to 
impact the entire economy 
has been touted for decades 
by 
fiscal 
conservatives. 

Former 
President 
Ronald 

Reagan is one of the most 
famous proponents of the 
ideology, even though the tax 
cuts implemented under his 
administration were regarded 
as relatively unsuccessful at 
promoting economic growth.

Fiscal conservatives want 

to believe that corporations, 
with 
the 
increased 
cash 

from the tax break, will 
increase 
wages, 
boost 

employment 
and 
invest 

more in the U.S. economy. 
The increase in wages and 
employment should put more 
money in the pockets of 
American consumers, making 
everybody better off through 
heightened consumption.

The 
slashing 
of 
the 

corporate 
income 
tax 

rate 
additionally 
served 

to 
incentivize 
businesses 

to 
continue 
operating 

domestically. 
Companies 

based in the U.S. have been 
relocating left and right to 
European countries in order 
to benefit from their low 
corporate income tax rates. 
Ireland, for example, boasts 
a 12.5 percent basic corporate 
tax rate, compared to 21 
percent in the United States. 
However, relocation of jobs 
abroad comes at the expense 
of American jobs and the 
American economy. 

Fiscal conservatives may 

feel certain that the expected 
advantages from these tax 
cuts will be realized in due 
time, but I wonder if they 

will truly come to fruition. 
Many, including myself, fear 
that companies will simply 
distribute the increased cash to 
shareholders through healthy 
dividends. Will firms realize 
their potential and make the 
most of their tax break to help 
the broader economy?

There have been a couple of 

hopeful signs since the bill’s 
passing 
that 
may 
suggest 

it could be effective. For 
example, Walmart recently 
announced that it plans to use 
its tax break to give bonuses 
to current employees and 
raise their minimum wage 
to $11 per hour. Considering 
Walmart 
employs 
nearly 

1.5 million Americans, this 
seemingly 
slight 
increase 

could 
have 
ripple 
effects 

throughout 
the 
economy. 

AT&T and Comcast reported 
that they plan to give out 
bonuses 
as 
well. 
Finally, 

because of a provision in 
the 
bill 
that 
incentivizes 

major corporations to bring 
offshore cash holdings back 
to the United States, Apple 
plans on bringing its overseas 
cash back to the U.S. in order 
to invest $30 billion over the 
next five years while creating 
20,000 new jobs.

Despite these hopeful signs, 

many still firmly believe that 
shareholders, who are usually 
wealthy already, will reap the 
greatest benefits from this 
bill. An analyst at Gordon 
Haskett Research Advisors 
wrote, “The $300 million of 
incremental labor expenses 
in 2018 only represents about 
15 percent of the potential 
cash windfall” that Walmart 
is expected to enjoy from the 
break. Though the minimum 
wage hike is a good sign, 
the company could be doing 
more. As for Apple, analysts 
are already expecting a large 
increase in share buybacks 
and dividends, which are 
unlikely to trickle through 
the economy.

Initially, I was in support 

of the bill as it represents 
everything 
that 
fiscal 

conservatives 
stand 
for. 

I’ve 
always 
thought 
of 

myself 
as 
socially 
liberal 

and fiscally conservative, a 
characterization that I know 
many of my peers share. 
But after researching the 
bill and reading the cynical 
views of its prospects, I’m 
not so sure anymore. I like 
the idea of making the U.S.’s 
corporate income tax rate 
more 
competitive 
among 

other industrialized nations, 
but I wonder whether or not 
everyone in the American 
economy, not just the wealthy, 
stand to be better off because 
of it.

If 
companies 
simply 

distribute the value of their 
tax break to shareholders, the 
bill has no chance of fulfilling 
its proponents’ expectations. 
I believe this reduction of 
the corporate tax rate will be 
a good test as to whether or 
not trickle-down economics, 
a 
cornerstone 
of 
fiscal 

conservatism, will truly work 
for the American economy.

New tax bill tests trickle-down economics

L

ast 
year, 
I 
had 
a 

memorable 
encounter 

after 
I 
decided 
to 

participate 
in 
the 
2017 

Women’s 
March; 
someone 

asked me what I thought I was 
accomplishing by marching. 
While he was the only one who 
inquired, there’s undoubtedly 
many who either question the 
Women’s March or choose 
to ridicule it. Conservative 
commentator Tomi Lahren is 
one of these people, tweeting 
sarcastically about the 2018 
Women’s March: “Nothing 
says ‘take me seriously’ like 
marching around in a pussy 
hat 
screaming 
profanities 

and demanding free things. 
#womensmarch.”
 To address Lahren’s tweet, 
the pink “pussy hats” that 
she’s referring to are not 
meant to be raunchy. These 
hats act as an undeniable 
display of femininity that 
reclaim the derogatory term 
“pussy” from those who use 
it both to objectify women 
and 
perpetuate 
the 
gross 

stereotype that women are 
weak. While there has been 
some backlash about the hat 
excluding women of color and 
women without vaginas, the 
creators of the hats are aware 
of the controversy and have 
addressed it. On Pussyhat 
Project’s 
website, 
project 

member 
Jayna 
Zweiman 

wrote, 
“There 
are 
some 

people who have felt invisible 
because of this project… our 
intent was and always will 
be to support all women. We 
hear some of you saying that 
this symbol has made some 
women feel excluded.” She 
also added that she is open 
to suggestions about how 
to make the hat inclusive 
for all women. While the 
Women’s March isn’t perfect, 
Zweiman’s 
willingness 
to 

listen is an example of how 
marchers are open to ideas 
to improve so that the march 
truly represents every woman 
who wants a voice.
 In addition, it’s clear that 
Lahren, who is notoriously 
anti-transgender, 
isn’t 

referring to how it excludes 
some women when she mocks 
the Women’s March in her 
tweet. Rather, she finds the 
hats ridiculous because they 
represent 
female 
genitals, 

and mocking them is an easy 
(and cheap) way to imply that 
the marchers are vulgar.
 As for the “screaming 
profanities 
part,” 
unless 

Lahren happened to attend 
every single one of the 673 

marches 
that 
took 
place 

worldwide 
Saturday, 
she 

clearly 
made 
a 
sweeping 

generalization 
about 
an 

entire group of people based 
on the actions of some of its 
members. At the march that I 
went to last year, only cheers 
and uplifting chants filled 
the air after powerful women 
like U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D–Mich., gave empowering, 
vibrant 
speeches 
urging 

everyone to fight for not just 
women’s rights, but human 
rights as well. There were 
no profanities being tossed 
around, nor did anyone shout 
insulting 
remarks 
about 

President Donald Trump or 
his 
administration. 
These 

things might have happened at 
other marches, but to reduce 
all Women’s Marches to the 
hate-filled chaos of a few is 
unfair. The women’s march is 
called the “Women’s March” 

rather than the “Anti-Trump 
March” or “Anti-Republican 
March” for a reason — it is for 
women and other feminists 
to stand together and show 
solidarity with one another, 
so that they know that they 
are not alone in the fight for 
gender equality.
 It most certainly is not so 
that women can ask for “free 
things.” What we want is 
for people of any gender to 
be treated fairly and with 
respect, whether it be in 
the workplace or out on the 
streets. We want the wage 
gap to disappear. We want 
access to healthcare. Many 
of 
the 
signs 
that 
people 

display in the marches show 
that what they want is better 
treatment — an end to sexual 
harassment is not a frivolous 
“free thing” that should be 
brushed aside.
 However, Lahren is only 
one of many who choose to 
ignore 
the 
reason 
people 

march, 
whether 
it’s 
for 

women’s rights, immigrants’ 
rights or for the Black Lives 

Matter 
movement. 
Trump 

made 
the 
march 
about 

himself, tweeting: “Beautiful 
weather all over our great 
country, a perfect day for 
all Women to March. Get 
out there now to celebrate 
the historic milestones and 
unprecedented 
economic 

success and wealth creation 
that has taken place over 
the last 12 months. Lowest 
female unemployment in 18 
years!” Trump’s tweet is an 
embodiment of why women 
march. We are sick of men 
trying to take control of our 
narrative. We are tired of 
having our voices unheard.
 Last year, I told the person 
who asked me why I wanted to 
march that I wanted to show 
solidarity with the women 
of my community. Now, one 
year after the presidential 
inauguration, 
I 
want 
to 

expand on that answer.
 I did not march expecting 
the results of the election 
to change, or for Trump to 
somehow be impeached. I, 
along with everyone else who 
marched either this year or 
last, am aware that crowding 
the streets with signs and 
chants will not magically 
make Trump liberal. The 
people 
who 
march, 
both 

women and their supporters, 
do it to show solidarity and 
build morale. So while the 
women’s 
marches 
might 

not 
result 
in 
immediate 

government 
action, 
this 

movement 
is 
impactful 

because it reminds not only 
feminists, but the world, that 
women will continue to speak 
out about issues that directly 
affect 
them. 
People 
like 

Lahren criticize the Women’s 
March for showing immature 
behavior, but there’s nothing 
juvenile about a group of 
passionate feminists standing 
up for what they believe in. 
It’s what Martin Luther King 
Jr. and other supporters of 
the Civil Rights Movement 
did; it’s what Alice Paul and 
other 
women 
suffragists 

did to advocate for the right 
to vote; it’s what members 
of the LGBTQ community 
did to fight for their rights. 
Like those before us, we will 
continue to stand in solidarity 
and let our voices be heard so 
that the world knows we are 
not afraid to fight for what we 
believe in.

Arts
Thursday, January 25, 2018 — 5

Opera, ballet and classical 
music 
are 
frequently 
shrouded in auras of elitism. 
During the Classical period, 
famous composers would be 
commissioned by rich aristocrats 
to compose for private events. 
Opera was quite expensive — 
the average person could barely 
afford to attend more than one 
opera performance every year. 
Ballet was also associated with 
wealth, 
royalty 
and 
elitism 
— it was initially an art form 
commissioned by the royal court 
to display the wealth and cultural 
magnificence of the court.
Over time, however, these 
genres of performance art have 
become increasingly accessible to 
the masses. The divide between 
upper class performance art 
and popular performance art 
has faded. The elitist appeal of 
these previously upper class art 
forms has faded as they become 
increasingly accessible to all, and 
audiences are becoming defined 
not by class, but by interest and 
aesthetic taste.
Though these art forms are 
beginning to react to this change 
in consumption, this reaction 
seems to not be occuring fast 
enough. 
Modern 
orchestras, 
dance 
companies 
and 
opera 
companies are facing diminishing 
financial returns and diminishing 
attendances. 
Many 
smaller 
companies are being forced to 
close due to lack of attendance, 
and many others are decreasing 
the number of performances that 
they give per year.
Overall, it seems as though 
these traditional art forms face a 
bleak future. This is a narrative 
pervasive throughout the cultural 
lexicon — the slow and painful 
demise of these “higher” art 
forms. The loss of many of the 
smaller, local performance arts 
institutions seems to foreshadow 
the loss of all performance arts 
institutions.
The 
solution 
to 
these 
diminishing 
performance 
attendances, however, may be 
the very step that many are 
hesitant to take. While many 
are tentative to embrace the loss 
of elitism, this may be the only 
means for these great art forms 
to support themselves. This loss 
of elitism need not be accepted 
begrudgingly — artists, genres 
and concepts of great artistic 
merit are already forming around 
this new intersection between the 
popular and the elitist.
Orchestras are increasingly 
turning to popular music and 
movie music as a means of 
drawing previously uninterested 
audiences 
into 
the 
concert 
hall. The advent of the “film in 
concert,” for example, seems to 
be providing the financial returns 
that 
many 
orchestras 
need, 
though they go against the elitist 
connotation 
many 
orchestras 
would like to preserve.
Modern dance, in addition, 
is 
similarly 
changing 
its 
programmatic habits as a means 
of maintaining their financial 
well-being. 
Performances 
of 
modern dance forms or with 
modern music are slowly entering 
even the most conservatively 
programmed company seasons. 
These 
performances 
draw 
the younger and more diverse 
audiences that these companies 
know they need to sustain 
themselves though they challenge 
the sophistication traditionally 
associated with formal dance 
companies.
Opera has also seen changes 
geared towards attracting and 
engaging new audiences. Modern 
operas depicting contemporary 
events are quietly changing the 
subject matter of traditional 
opera. John Adam’s “Nixon in 
China” challenged a generation 
of 
composers 
to 
compose 
operas about current events and 
non-traditional 
stories 
from 
the Western canon. This has 
challenged the refined taste of 
many die-hard opera enthusiasts, 
though it has restored opera’s 

relevance to the larger lexicon of 
mass culture.
This 
loss 
of 
elitism 
is 
an 
inevitable 
result 
of 
the 
increasingly 
interconnected 
world that we live in and the 
gradual 
loss 
of 
boundaries 
between art forms and genres. 
Whether we like it or not, this 
process will only accelerate as 
time and technology progress.
Not all of these changes, 
furthermore, are regrettable. The 
growth of niche art communities 
has helped develop increasingly 
specific ensembles and companies 
dedicated to the performance of 
specific artists, time periods and 
other definable artistic traits. 
Early music has become a staple 
of some communities, as has 
specific types of opera and ballet. 
Increasingly specific marketing, 
furthermore, 
has 
allowed 
audiences and performers to be 
more specific and selective in 
their programming and ticket 
consumption. It is not uncommon 
to see opera companies plan 
whole seasons around common 
themes or common historical 
eras.
The loss of elitism in classical 
music, modern dance and opera 
seems to threaten the prevalence 
and dominance of specific time 
periods and creators within these 
art forms. Though these classical 
performance arts remain more 
resistant to change than most 
popular art forms are, all art 
forms must select specific creators 
and eras from the past to value 
more than others. The constant 
redefinition and reorganization 
of previous artistic periods based 
on current artistic trends is as 
inherent to performance art as 
is the creation of new work. The 
loss of elitism is most threatening 
in that it will upend the general 
aesthetic consensus that has 
developed around these art forms 
over generations.
In 
this 
new, 
non-elitist 
understanding of classical music, 
for example, Romantic composers 
could be ignored while early 
Baroque and Medieval composers 
became popular. German and 
Italian opera could be shunned in 
favor of the early British operettas. 
Ballet could be rejected in favor of 
hip hop or other modern trends. 
The 
ever-changing 
Western 
canon of performance art will by 
defined by audience interest and 
not by academic expertise.
This loss of centralized and 
standardized repertoires may be 
frightening, but it is also thrilling. 
It represents one of the biggest 
changes that these performance 
art forms have seen in hundreds of 
years — tremendous opportunities 
for audiences, performers and 
creators to pluralize and diversify 
these art forms.
This 
past 
weekend, 
for 
example, Pulitzer-Prize-winning 
composer Julia Wolfe spoke to 
students in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance about her music 
and her creative process. Her 
recent composition “Anthracite 
Fields,” for example, explores 
the lives of early 20th-century 
miners. It is a composition 
geared towards both classical 
and popular audiences. Wolfe 
claims that this composition 
has garnered more mail than 
any other composition that she 
has ever written — drawing 
many previously uninterested 
music listeners into the realm of 
contemporary classical music.
Artists such as Julia Wolfe 
are 
redefining 
the 
divisions 
between classical and popular art 
forms. Audiences are redefining 
the consumption patterns and 
programmatic tendencies of these 
classical and popular art forms. 
Performers, in turn, are learning 
to execute increasingly diverse 
swathes of performance arts. This 
is nothing if not a time of change; 
a time of radical redefinition 
and drastic reevaluation. It is 
a loss of elitism, and a time of 
empowerment for the masses. 
The average person has more say 
in performance art then was ever 
possible before, carrying a voice 
that matches or even triumphs 
over the elitism of traditional 
performance arts.

The Fading Role 
of Elitism in 
Performance Art

DAILY COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

Stephen Kellogg has been 
one of my favorite artists for 
a long time. I first heard the 
Americana 
singer-songwriter 
almost seven years ago, and 
I’m still listening to what 
he — in all of his graceful, 
heartbreaking simplicity — has 
to say. In anticipation of his 
upcoming performance at The 
Ark’s Folk Festival this Friday, 
Kellogg spoke with The Daily 
on the heartbeats that keep him 
running, and the storytelling 
that has kept fans like me 
around for the long-haul.
There’s a certain fearlessness 
required in writing the way 
Kellogg writes. In “The Open 
Heart (South),” he sings, “And 
I still shudder at the memory of 
my failures and mistakes / Hey 
so what, it opened up my heart.”
He tells us exactly what he 
means, every time, and it’s not 
because he’s disingenuous, or 
he doesn’t care. It’s because he 
is, genuinely, unafraid to share 
himself with us. We get to hear 
his highest highs and his lowest 
lows because “Hey so what … 
(he’s) got an open heart.” What 
he does fear only makes him 
that much more human.
“I fear what I think many 
of us fear,” he said. “That 
somehow, the bottom’s going 
to drop, and you’re not going 
to be able to keep making art 
and expressing yourself. You’re 
afraid you’re going to run out 
of money, or nobody’s going to 
care.”
Allowing himself to ruminate 
in 
his 
own 
vulnerabilities, 
he progresses with a level of 
effortlessness that, as far as I 
can tell, only means one thing: 

This is what he’s supposed to be 
doing.
“The thing about me, and 
what keeps me going, and 
whatever drives me, is that I 
need to do it. It has never been 
an option,” he said. “When 
an opportunity comes up, I’m 
inclined to say yes: always. 
And I don’t think that that’s 
because I’m so driven. I think 
it’s just because — it’s just 
because I need to do this. I 

need to write, I need to play, I 
need to go out into the world 
and share it, and connect with 
others, and say, ‘Here’s what I 
think about things’ and have 
a dialogue — as much as that’s 
possible when you’re up there 
with a microphone, performing 
a show.”
Kellogg’s work is vocational 
for him, and, lucky for us, he’s 
good at it. Really good. He’s 
been in the game for a minute 
now, 
having 
led 
Stephen 
Kellogg and the Sixers for nine 
gorgeous years. The group went 
on hiatus in 2012, after playing 
over 1200 shows together.
“It was a little bit like a 
divorce where the couple still 

loves each other and, you know, 
hugs and cries and then moves 
out of the house,” he said. “As 
time has gone on, I think we’ve 
all done things that we might 
not have done had we been 
playing together, and you sort 
of look at it and go, ‘Well, this is 
exactly how it had to be,’ … and 
eventually, as happens when 
you go through some kind of 
breakup, it became not painful 
to talk about them, and it didn’t 
hurt.”
So, he kept on. As Kellogg 
grew — learning to do so both 
with and without The Sixers — 
his lyrics evolved in tandem.
“At some point, I decided 
that I wanted my songs to be 
vignettes of everything I need 
to say before I die,” he said.
He places so much weight 
on every word he articulates, 
and that’s why his music hits 
as hard as it does. It’s sincere, 
and it’s him. When I asked what 
inspires him, he responded in 
the most Stephen Kellogg way 
that he could have:
“This is going to sound hoity-
toity, 
but 
Charles 
Dickens. 
When I read Charles Dickens, 
I want to go write lyrics. That 
brings out the rock ‘n’ roll in 
me.”
It’s hard not to like him 
— whether that be for his 
unabashed 
honesty, 
his 
never-ending love for his four 
daughters or the fact that 
he married his high school 
sweetheart (or all of the above).
“I think so many of us,” he 
said, “are trying to balance our 
lives in a way that feels healthy 
and right, and sometimes you 
get it more right than others. 
The biggest thing that I end 
up doing is … I love. I love my 
family so much, and when I’m 
home, I really try to be there. 

To really go for it.”
“But whenever there’s an 
opportunity 
professionally 
that I feel like I have and I 
should do, I really force myself 
to say yes. Even though it’s 
hard,” he continued. “I’m still 
a wimp though, when it comes 
to leaving the house. I’ll be 
blubbering as we pull down the 
road, you know, driving away. 
But you do what you’ve got to 
do.”

And, that’s exactly what he’s 
doing. Stephen Kellogg will 
play at The Ark’s 41st Annual 
Folk Festival this Friday.
“I am so honored to do that 
gig and to do that show,” Kellogg 
said. “The people who are 
playing it (and) running it — it’s 
just people I have tremendous 
respect for. It always, always 
feels amazing to be in company 
that you’re proud to keep.”
Go for the music and stay 
for his stories. I’ll be there 
(crying, probably), and singer-
songwriter Joe Pug is set 
to emcee. Tickets are still 
available for both Friday and 
Saturday online and at the 
Michigan Union Ticket Office.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘THE GOOD SIDE’

 Troye Sivan’s newest single, “The 
Good Side,” is his most mature release 
yet. Its attraction lies in the fact that 
it invites the listener to mature along 
with him.
 “The Good Side” deals with a 
breakup. The beginning of the song 
is soft and acoustic, a combination 
that always feels like it lends itself — 
whether this is true or not — to authen-
ticity. Sivan’s polished lyrics reinforce 
this, as he acknowledges, “I got the 
good side of things / Left you with both 
of the rings.” He’s refreshingly self-
aware, not only professing what he’s 
learned from the relationship, but he 
also admits that his job as a musician 
might have made things harder for his 
ex (“The people danced to the sound 
of your heart / The world sang along 
to it falling apart”). This is a position 
of sympathy that is surprisingly rare 
in breakup songs. One gets the sense 
that Sivan is trying to treat the other 
person justly and compassionately, at 
one point claiming: “So many thoughts 
I wanted to share / But I didn’t call 
because it wouldn’t be fair.”
 The soft feeling never really leaves 
the song, but around halfway through, 

it blooms into a much more expansive 
wall of sound. The suddenly synthy 
atmosphere doesn’t seem like it would 
blend so well with the acoustics of the 
rest of the song, but it actually does. By 
the four-minute mark, the song itself 
has matured into a self-conscious act 
of poetry dressed up in dazzling elec-

tronica. It’s starry but not flashy, deep 
but not at all empty.
 “I’m sure we’ll meet in the spring 
/ And catch up on everything,” Sivan 
sings in the final verse. And you can’t 
help but hope that they do.

SUNDANCE REVIEW

There are worse problems 

in the world, but I fear Keira 
Knightley has been typecast. 
Consider, for a minute, the 
sheer 
amount 
of 
British 

period dramas she’s appeared 
in (and yeah, “Pirates of the 
Caribbean” counts). There’s 
her 
Joe 
Wright 
trilogy, 

with 
“Pride 
& 
Prejudice,” 

“Atonement” 
and 
“Anna 

Karenina.” There’s the David 
Cronenberg film “A Dangerous 
Method.” And her most recent 
Oscar nomination came for 
“The Imitation Game.” This 
is no insult to Knightley, who 
reliably fills her characters 
with a vitality that brings 
relevance 
to 
characters 

otherwise faded from memory.

“Colette” marks Knightley’s 

return 
to 
the 
genre 
and, 

once again, she brings her 
trademark vigor to the role. 
Knightley 
portrays 
the 

famous French writer of the 
title 
(real 
name 
Gabrielle 

Colette) through a decade and 
change as she develops her 
writing with the publication 
of the “Claudine” series of 
somewhat-autobiographical 
novels. Colette, a poor country 
girl, marries the wealthier 
Henry 
Gauthier-Villars 

(Dominic West, “The Square”), 
who “writes” novels under the 
pseudonym Willy, relying on 
his employees to do the grunt 
work while Willy markets the 

novels. After frustrating his 
laborers, he turns to Colette, 
oftentimes locking her in a 
room to force her to write. As 
it turns out, Colette, whose 
utterances themselves have 
something of a beguiling ring, 
is quite a talented writer, and 
“Claudine at School” is a hit.

The 
film’s 
first 
half, 

depicting the couple’s ascent, 
is rather dull, if not perfectly 
delightful. 
You’ll 
like 
this 

section 
if 
you 
enjoy 
the 

work of Tom Hooper or Joe 
Wright, 
who 
consistently 

churn out indelible British 
period dramas, with a few 
jokes sprinkled in to satisfy 
a 
“wholesome” 
movie 

experience. 
But 
otherwise, 

patience may be required for 
those 
desiring 
something 

less risk-averse, since what 
may have remained a stodgy 
and 
stuffy 
chamber 
piece 

transforms into full-on erotic 
drama by the second half, as 
Colette explores her attraction 
to women. Once Colette and 
Willy find success, and the 
luxuries of upper class life 
are available to them, the 
story opens up to a sometimes 
bold 
character 
exploration, 

especially 
of 
Colette. 
One 

scene, in which she flirts with 
an American woman through 
hair play, sparkles with sensual 
tension. A montage depicting a 
number of sexual encounters 
including both Colette and 
West is strangely charming.

Unfortunately, 
West’s 

character remains somewhat 

enigmatic. The screenplay sets 
up a series of contradicting 
behaviors, abusing his wife 
and professing his love as if it 
were the most obvious fact in 
the world to himself, her and 
us, and West doesn’t do much 
to elucidate his thoughts. And 
while the screenplay is plagued 
by 
lifeless 
and 
expository 

dialogue and relies much too 
heavily on the tiresome tropes 
of the genre — Knightley gets 
her Oscar nomination clip 
with one particularly powerful 
monologue, a feat of acting but 
embalmed by stale writing — 
the film is bubbly and pleasant 
enough to enjoy two hours 
with. 

***
There’s a line in the film 

“Frances Ha” in which the 
titular Frances, finally finding 
an 
opportunity 
to 
smoke 

indoors rather than leaning 
cautiously out the window, 
says that she feels “like a 
bad mother from 1957.” For 
better or worse, I think we 
all know what she’s talking 
about: The archetypal mother, 
frustrated by domesticity yet 
without a Betty Friedan book 
to articulate it, smoking and 
neglecting her children.

Leave it to Carey Mulligan 

(“Mudbound”) 
to 
breathe 

glorious life into Frances’s 
vision. In “Wildlife,” with 
the 
exceptionally 
assured 

directorial debut of Paul Dano 
(“Okja”), she’s a mother in 
1959, newly moved to Helena, 
Montana. Jeanette’s husband, 

SUNDANCE

‘Colette’ & ‘Wildlife’ hint 
future Oscars at Sundance

Jerry 
(Jake 
Gyllenhaal, 

“Stronger”), works at a golf 
course and plays football with 
his son, Joe (Ed Oxenbould, 
“Better 
Watch 
Out”), 
who 

seems less enthused with the 
rough sport. After he loses 
his job, Jerry refuses to take 
a job that a teenager would 
do. He tries to reaffirm his 
masculinity 
by 
leaving 
the 

family to fight a wildfire raging 
nearby. Jeanette is devastated 
and, beginning to consider 
leaving her husband, starts 
to clue in Joe to the couple’s 
marital stresses. 

“Wildlife,” adapted from a 

1990 Richard Ford novel of the 
same name, is a horror movie 
cloaked in coming-of-age and 
kitchen sink drama. Joe plays 
witness 
to 
the 
crumbling 

foundation 
of 
his 
family. 

Oxenbould, 
with 
a 
demure 

and somewhat downtrodden 
expression plastered on his 
face, is excellent as Joe becomes 
disillusioned 
watching 
his 

mother’s life unravel. This is 
Joe’s story, after all, and Dano 
trains his focus on him — his 
confusion, his friendship with a 
classmate and his employment 
at the local photography studio.

Dano 
lets 
his 
characters 

live 
in 
the 
scene, 
often 

choosing to keep the camera 
stationary, 
highlighting 
the 

characters’ raw movements and 
emotions. Oxenbould is a great 
protagonist, a blank canvas 
for 
audience 
participation, 

while Mulligan and Bill Camp 
(“Molly’s Game”), who plays 
Jeanette’s lover, inhabit their 
roles with audacity and passion. 
Gyllenhaal, 
who 
disappears 

for a large segment, seems too 
young and boyish to play this 
role, but at certain moments, 
especially in a late scene in a 
bar, his intensity matches the 
others in the cast.

The word or phrase “wild 

life” appears, by my count, 
twice in the film: Once around 
the middle, when Joe asks 
Jeanette what happens to the 
wildlife when a fire ravages 
their habitat, and second when 
Jerry, upon returning home, 
castigates his wife for her 
infidelity by exclaiming, only 
half sarcastically, what a wild 
life this is. That change — from 
one word to two — is crucial, 
because among the pastoral 
and eerily quiet landscapes 
of Montana, neither families 
nor 
the 
environment 
that 

surrounds them can stay intact 
for too long.

Books that Built 
Us: ‘The Glass 
Castle’’s legacy

In the spirit of honesty, 

writing this scares the shit out 
of me. Sometimes, a story hits 
so hard it knocks the wind out 
of you. There’s never going to 
be a right way to verbalize the 
feeling, but you blunder on 
anyway. So it goes.

“The Glass Castle” (2005) 

is a memoir by Jeannette 
Walls in which she details 
her experiences growing up. 
It’s frighteningly poignant, 
and it reads as a series of 

memories, giving a face to 
human fortitude and finding 
love in the trenches of broken 
promises.

Jeannette’s 
upbringing 

was unconventional, to say 
the least. Constantly moving 
her and her three siblings 
around 
the 
country, 
her 

parents couldn’t afford to 
stay in one place for too long, 
so they made every spot on 
the map an adventure. Rex, 
her father, was a visionary, 
an entrepreneur, a romantic. 
He was also an alcoholic, 
spending the little money 
they had on booze. He would 
disappear for days until finally 
arriving home, bruised and 
enraged. Rose Mary Walls, 
Jeannette’s mother, was an 
artist. Her art was passionate, 
and she loved it like a child. 
She was also self-indulgent 
and sometimes reckless with 
her energy, spending it on her 
paintings rather than feeding 
her children.

This book took me a whole 

summer to read because I kept 
having to put it down. At every 
shout, every manipulation, 
every door-slam, I had to 
put the story to bed — partly 
because it hit too close to 
home, and partly because I 
felt guilty for thinking that it 
did.

Walls — whose world never 

ceased to disappoint her and 
whose hero never ceased to 
fail her — forgives. She seeks 
out love, and she’s ready for 
it when it comes, in whatever 
form it may take. My world 
has been terribly charmed, 
and 
my 
hero 
was 
never 

supposed to be perfect — but 
I can’t open myself the way 
Walls opens herself. I don’t 
know how to.

It didn’t take me long to 

figure out that my heroes 
are human like the rest of 
us. 
Reading 
Jeannette’s 

memories, where this truth 
glimmers throughout, forced 
me to revisit every moment 
that led to this revelation. It 
took me to the raging letter 
— tucked away in my sock 
drawer — that I never had 
the guts, or the heart, to read 
aloud. It took me to the top 
of the steps, where I’d perch 
myself, waiting for the other 

shoe but never hearing it drop. 
It took me through the anger, 
through the pain, and shot me 
into the most confusing part: 
the love.

Unconditional 
love 
is 

complicated and exhausting 
and, more than anything, 
it hurts. The moment you 
realize that the person you 
treasure most in the world 
— the one on your highest 
pedestal, who’s never going 
to hurt you, never going to 
let you down — isn’t perfect 
is the moment that leaves the 
biggest hole in your heart. But 
you love them nonetheless.

Near the beginning of the 

memoir, Jeannette recounts 
a Christmas when her family 
had no money. Her dad takes 
her and her siblings out under 
the stars, telling them to 
pick their favorite. Jeannette 
writes, “We laughed about all 
the kids who believed in the 
Santa myth and got nothing 
for Christmas but a bunch 
of cheap plastic toys. ‘Years 
from now, when all the junk 
they got is broken and long 
forgotten,’ Dad said, ‘you’ll 
still have your stars.’”

Rex shattered every piece 

of her, but when Jeannette 
finally 
put 
herself 
back 

together again, she found 
herself loving him, still. Years 
later, she still has her star, 
and it’s because of this feeling 
— this inexplicable, messy 
intangibility in clutching on 
to someone so tightly that 
you can’t imagine a life in 
which you ever let them go. 
Her story, regardless of how 

far she strayed from it or 
how abstract the connection 
became, 
always 
revolved 

around her relationship with 
her father: learning to loathe 
him, learning to leave him 
and learning to live without 
him.

Jeannette 
Walls 
doesn’t 

want your pity. She doesn’t 
want people to villainize her 
parents or place blame for 
how she grew up. Everyone 
has a story, and I think she 
wanted 
us 
to 
recognize 

flickers of ours in hers. I

I’m left to dance with is love.

Hot Wolverines humbled by the strength of the rest of the conference

With consecutive sweeps for 

the first time in three seasons, 
the No. 17 Michigan hockey team 
has positioned itself in the top 
half of the Big Ten standings and 
is back in the hunt for an NCAA 
Tournament bid.

Since defeating then-No. 9 

Minnesota and then-No. 12 Penn 
State, the Wolverines (7-7-2-1 
Big Ten, 12-10-2 overall) have 
jumped from No. 27 to No. 15 in 
the PairWise rankings. These 
rankings are annually a solid 
indicator of qualifiers for the 
16-team NCAA Tournament and 
Michigan is within the cutoff, 
determined not to dip out of 
contention.

The Wolverines, after being 

sixth in the conference standings 
earlier this season, are now the 
sole owner of third place with 24 
points — only one ahead of the 
Nittany Lions and one behind No. 
6 Ohio State. They look primed 
to host a best-of-three series for 
the first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament.

But in one of college hockey’s 

most dominant conferences, all 
can change in a moment’s notice. 
And with eight Big Ten games left, 
Michigan knows that.

“We could easily be on a four-

game win streak or a six-game 

losing streak, so I think we know 
to take it game by game, weekend 
by weekend,” said sophomore 
forward Jake Slaker. “We don’t 
try to look ahead or look in the 
past, we just kind of take it how it 
comes.”

The 
Big 

Ten 
has 
seen 

unprecedented 
depth, with six of 
the seven teams 
in the top-20 in 
PairWise and the 
conference 
foes 

splitting 
series 

regularly.

At the end of 

last season, the 
point differential 
between 
the 

second and fifth-ranked teams 
in the Big Ten standings was 14 
points. This year, it’s currently 
five.

That’s not to say the standings 

won’t revert to last year’s larger 
gaps between teams. But by the 
looks of it, most of the conference 
order — apart from No. 1 Notre 
Dame, which is 14 points ahead 
of the pack — may not be decided 
until the final weeks of the regular 
season.

Slaker 
acknowledges 
the 

newfound parity in Big Ten 
competition has led to a tighter 
race for the back half of the season.

“From last year playing in the 

Big Ten, it was a little bit more 
separated, but I think this year 
it seems every team is equal,” he 
said. “No matter what, any team 
you play, it’s going to be an absolute 
battle and any team can win any 

game. Every game 
is so important 
in the Big Ten 
because 
you 

know 
everyone 

is 
flipping 
and 

flopping, between 
second, 
third, 

fourth, whatever 
place.”

From 
a 

practical 
standpoint, 
the strength of 

conference opponents helps with 
PairWise rankings. Wins against 
highly-ranked Big Ten teams 
catapult the victors to greater 
positioning — a la Michigan 
moving 12 spots over the past two 
weekends. Falling to these same 
top-tier teams doesn’t hurt the 
losers much — because of its RPI, 
Penn State dropped just four spots 
from No. 12 to No. 16 after being 
swept by the Wolverines.

The new conference intensity 

hasn’t only kept programs afloat 
in the rankings, though. The 
toughness has also led to an 
improvement 
in 
overall 
play, 

according to Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson.

“It’s made us better,” Pearson 

said. “It’s forced us to be better 
because if you don’t, you’re going 
to get your rear end handed to you 
every night and you have to show 
up and compete. 
Fortunately, 
we’ve been pretty 
good 
lately. 
I 

think 
the 
first 

half, you saw we 
were inconsistent, 
giving up six goals 
and five goals and 
now we’re a little 
bit more locked in.

“There’s 
no 

trap 
game 
or 

sandwich 
game 

because you just have to keep 
going. The biggest thing is keeping 
the energy level up because week 
after week after week, you keep 
playing good teams.”

For 
Pearson, 
it’s 
vital 
to 

block out the noise and outside 

distractions. 
He 
constantly 

reminds his players to concentrate 
on the tasks at hand — building 
on recent successes, continuing 
to improve in weaker areas and 
maintaining momentum down the 
stretch.

“It’s just human 

nature 
to 
look 

at the standings 
or 
people 
talk 

to you about the 
standings 
or 

ask 
you 
about 

the 
PairWise,” 

Pearson 
said. 

“They’re all aware 
of it, they look at 
it. But right now, 
as coaches, we 
have to try to — 

when we have the opportunity 
with them — get them to focus on 
the other things, the other things 
that we need to do that’ll help.”

The focus has worked up 

to this point. A second-half 
resurgence for a once-sluggish 

team, contributions from skaters 
starting to rise to the occasion and 
statement wins have all propelled 
the Wolverines lately.

Despite the turnaround hot 

streak to start off the new year, 
Pearson sees his team completely 
differently 
heading 
into 
the 

weekend road series against the 
Buckeyes — not as a team that is 
already in contention but one that 
still has much yet to prove.

“We’ve been fortunate because 

every team has been ahead of us,” 
Pearson said. “Minnesota was 
ahead of us, we leapfrogged them. 
Penn State was ahead of us in the 
standings, then we leapfrogged 
them. And now we get another 
opportunity (at Ohio State).

“At some point, we might 

become the favorites, but we’re 
still going to relish that underdog 
role and the role fits us well. I 
don’t pay much attention (to the 
rankings), I just know we have 
to continue winning and then 
everything takes care of itself.”

Wolverines looking to hammer their opponents

This season, there’s been an 

additional factor motivating 
the Michigan wrestling team 
to compete at its best week in 
and week out and it’s exactly 
what you would expect: a toy 
hammer.

A replica of Thor’s hammer 

to be exact.

Mjolnir, 
the 
name 
for 

this 
fearsome 

hammer, 
is 

wielded by the 
Norse 
god 
of 

thunder, 
Thor, 

and is one of the 
most ubiquitous 
symbols 
of 

strength 
in 

existence. 
Capable 
of 
leveling 

mountains, 
the 

fabled tool struck fear into 
the eyes of the beholder and 
propelled Thor into eternal 
notoriety, a legacy that still 
holds today.

Now, 
Mjolnir 
serves 
a 

slightly different purpose as 
the Wolverines compete each 
week for control over the 
hammer.

The object is simple. Score 

the most individual points in a 
match and the hammer is yours. 
Obtain a pin and the wrestler is 
rewarded with an additional 15 
points towards the hammer.

If a wrestler happens to win 

the hammer that week, they 
are forever immortalized as 

their name is 
drawn on the 
hammer 
as 
a 

symbol of their 
triumphant 
victory.

While 
the 

incentive 
of 

winning a small, 
toy 
hammer 

seems to pale 
in 
comparison 

to the feeling of 

winning a match outright, this 
intrasquad rivalry has worked 
wonders 
on 
the 
wrestlers’ 

aggressiveness.

“We want to make sure that 

we’re 
constantly 
out 
there 

aggressive and scoring,” said 
fifth-year senior Adam Coon. 
“A person who only gets a 
takedown at the end would 
only get two points toward the 
hammer, but a guy who wins 
seven to nothing, obviously 
that guy was more involved, 
but in the match score it’s still 
only three points. So we want 
to make sure we are rewarding 
the guy who’s attacking.”

The tradition began last 

season 
as 

associate 
coach 

Sean 
Bormet 

introduced 
the 

concept to inspire 
more 
individual 

points and team 
competition.

The team has 

been 
incredibly 

receptive to the 
new trophy, even 
silently 
keeping 

track of the standings during 
the meet to see where they 
rank. Some of the athletes 
will even strive for additional 
takedowns in a match in order 
to compete for the hammer.

For instance, in the Dec. 

10 bout against Oregon State, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Myles 

Amine strategically positioned 
himself to score a last second 
takedown by ostensibly letting 
his opponent escape to compete 
for the hammer, a feat he then 
split with Coon as they both 
secured 20 individual points.

“It gets these guys competing 

with each other,” said Michigan 
coach Joe McFarland. “We just 

don’t throw it 
out there all 
the time and 
internally, 
it 

gets these guys 
competing 
with 
each 

other over who 
can score the 
most 
points. 

Not 
all 
the 

fluff 
stuff, 

just 
in 
our 

practice room from weekend to 
weekend.”

Across all collegiate sports, 

many 
teams 
have 
certain 

motivational props used to 
galvanize support for their 
program. Whether it be the 
Miami football team’s turnover 
chain, Ohio State’s pin chain 
or the variety of different 
turnover trash cans, all of these 
items seek to add an additional 
layer of competition to give a 
team the extra edge.

What separates Michigan’s 

Mjolnir, however, is its lack of 
glitz and glamour. All of the 
other items are brandished on 
the arena of competition, while 
the hammer humbly awaits its 
victor at the Bahna Wrestling 
Center.

The week’s winner does not 

pound his chest or find the 
nearest camera to advertise 
his new accolade. Rather, he 
returns to his teammates with 
bragging rights and a will to 
defend his title in the coming 
week.

CAT MYKOLAJTCHUK/Daily

Coon’s quick pin helps 
Michigan earn victory

Occasionally great feats can 

occur in short periods of time.

For 
example, 
Thomas 

Jefferson wrote the Declaration 
of Independence in just 17 days. 
Similarly and maybe even more 
impressive, 
Beyonce 
and 
the 

The-Dream composed the 2000s 
anthem “Single Ladies” in a mere 
twenty minutes. Kobe Bryant once 
dropped 81 points on Jalen Rose 
and the Raptors in 42 minutes of 
action and Usain Bolt became the 
world’s fastest man after running 
200 meters in 9.58 seconds.

And 
yet, 
these 
all 
pale 

in 
comparison 
to 
fifth-year 

heavyweight 
Adam 
Coon’s 

performance Friday night at Cliff 
Keen Arena.

Satirical comparisons aside, in 

the first matchup of the night, Coon 
pinned his Wisconsin opponent, 
Ben Stone, within 40 seconds. 
From the start of the match, Coon’s 
intentions were clear.

“You could tell he was really, 

really looking for it,” said Michigan 
coach Joe McFarland. “Right 
away I turned to our 125-pounder 
and said, ‘You better be ready to 
go. This thing is not going seven 
minutes.’ ” 

Coon 
was 
placed 
in 
the 

unfamiliar position of wrestling 
first in a dual-meet. The NCAA 
stipulates that in a dual-meet 
setting, both teams’ coaches must 
agree on which weight class to 
start the meet with. Traditionally 
they decide on 125 pounds. If 
there is no agreement, the starting 
weight class is drawn randomly 
and the other weight classes follow 
sequentially. This time around, 
heavyweight was drawn.

“That was different,” Coon 

said. “I haven’t started a match 
since sophomore year, and that 
was my only time starting one. It 
is definitely a different experience. 
I’m used to ending it, not starting 

things up, so there’s a little bit (of) 
different nerves there.”

Whatever nerves Coon had 

before the match were alleviated 
pretty quickly as he hip tossed 
Stone to the mat. Michigan fans 
in attendance weren’t in their 
seats long before Coon delivered 
the fall. In addition to firing up 
the crowd, Coon’s quick pin also 
helped galvanize his teammates in 
the 29-10 rout of the 23rd-ranked 
Badgers.

“That’s always good to start off 

like that,” said 184-pound senior 
Domenic Abounader, who also won 
his matchup in decisive fashion. 
“It gets the team going, gets some 
momentum going and gets some 
confidence going for our team.”

The momentum was evident, as 

the next four Wolverine wrestlers 
won their matches. This run 
included another first-round pin by 
149-pound redshirt junior Malik 
Amine, who was quick to praise 
Coon.

“I love it,” Amine said. “I think 

Coon’s a pinner. I think he’s one of 
the best pinners in the country and 
he doesn’t get a lot of attention, but 
the kid’s a great wrestler.”

Coon improved to 17-0 on 

the season with an 8-0 record in 
dual-meets this season after the 
win on Friday night. While the 
goal from the outset has been 
to win a national championship 
both individually and as a team, 
excellent 
performances 
like 

Fridays are always welcomed by 
Coon.

“I thought I kept calm and just 

worked my way back into it,” he 
said. “When (Stone) started to 
move, I kind of set myself up for 
that throw. I was just calm and 
worked position.”

Though the match went well 

for Coon — the No. 2 heavyweight 
in the nation — there will 
undoubtedly be bigger tests ahead 
in both the Big Ten and NCAA 
Tournament, especially if he wants 
to put a ring on it.

In No. 3 Purdue, Michigan faces toughest test

John 
Beilein 
believes 

Purdue might be the best Big 
Ten team Michigan has faced.

No, not this season. The best 

ever.

Beilein began Wednesday’s 

press conference by saying as 
much, comparing the third-
ranked Boilermakers to great 
teams of the past.

“I’ve 
been 

here 
long 

enough to tell 
you 
there’s 

some 
pretty 

good 
teams 

in this league 
we’ve 
seen,” 

Beilein 
said. 

“Look 
at 

the 
great 

Wisconsin 
teams, 
the 

terrific Purdue teams from 
earlier in my career that were 
so good. Indiana, ourselves 
had games where there were 
just incredibly talented, these 
guys are still playing in the 
league. Purdue has everything 
that all those teams had. And 
maybe more than any of those 
teams, they have incredible 
experience. … I haven’t seen 
anything like this.”

It’s high praise, but with the 

way Purdue has been playing 
recently, it’s easy to see where 
Beilein is coming from.

The Boilermakers (8-0 Big 

Ten, 19-2 overall) have won 
three straight games by at least 
23 points, rising to the No. 2 
spot in the KenPom rankings 
along the way.

They’re the same team the 

Wolverines (6-3, 17-5) lost to by 
a point two weeks ago in Ann 
Arbor. They still impose their 

will on the inside 
with 
7-foot-2 

center Isaac Haas 
and his backup, 
7-foot-3 
Matt 

Haarms. 
They 

still 
threaten 

teams with their 
outside shooting 
— they made 20 
3-pointers 
in 

their 
win 
over 

Iowa. And they 

still play elite defense both on 
and off the ball. 

Michigan 
was 
able 
to 

counter all of that to make the 
first game close.

If anything, though, the first 

matchup has propelled Purdue 
to new heights, as its last three 
outcomes may indicate. 

Needless 
to 
say, 
the 

Wolverines have their work 
cut out for them.

“It 
presents 
a 
great 

challenge for us — a really 
good opportunity,” said fifth-
year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson. “Like (Beilein) said, 
they’re a really tough team to 
beat, especially at their place. 
But we’re excited for the 
opportunity for sure.”

Perhaps the biggest thing the 

game against the Boilermakers 
did was give the blueprint on 
how to guard the Wolverines. 
Purdue switched on every 
ball screen in 
that 
matchup, 

refusing 
to 

allow 
junior 

forward 
Moritz Wagner 
get 
open 
for 

his 
patented 

pick-and-pop 
3-pointer.

Since 
that 

game, Nebraska 
guarded 
Michigan the same way, quite 
successfully. It’s a problem 
that Beilein’s teams have faced 
before, but even he admits that 
it’s been an easier conundrum 
to solve in the past.

On Wednesday, he cited how 

former guard Trey Burke was 
able to break those defenses by 
simply shooting over them.

This year’s team has tried 

a variety of solutions, such as 
attempting to feed Wagner 

on the post and drive past 
bigger defenders with guards. 
Against the Cornhuskers — 
and the Boilermakers, to an 
extent — that strategy didn’t 
work.

But in the end, Beilein 

says, there’s only so much 
gameplanning the coaches can 
do. At some point, the players 
have to be the ones to beat the 
defense.

“It’s not only a schematic 

thing,” 
Beilein 

said. “It is a 
thing, 
‘Alright, 

can you actually 
score 
against 

somebody doing 
this? Can you 
actually 
score 

— guard score 
on a big, and a 
big score on a 
small? Can you 
make that entry 

pass in there? So we’ve tried 
to think of everything, and I 
know I grow as a coach every 
day of what we can do. But I 
don’t feel, like, ‘I can’t wait 
until people switch on us right 
now, because we’ve got the 
answers.’ We’re still solving 
that.”

In the end, Thursday’s game 

will be a litmus test for the 
offense against a particular 
defensive scheme, sure, but it 
will also mean more than that.

With the relative lack of 

depth in the Big Ten, this 
game will be one of the 
Wolverines’ final chances to 
prove themselves against an 
elite team. They don’t play 
Michigan State again, and 
their one remaining game 
against a ranked team is at 
home against No. 13 Ohio 
State.

It’s not like Michigan is in 

need of a resume boost with 
the successes they’ve had so 
far this season, but Thursday’s 
game is one of the last regular 
season opportunities for the 
Wolverines to prove they can 
hang with the upper echelon 
of college basketball.

It’s one of the final chances 

for 
Michigan 
to 
prove 
it 

belongs.

Michigan men’s basketball coach John Beilein believes that Purdue may be the best Big Ten team he’s ever seen.

“Purdue has 

everything that 
all those teams 

had.”

“But we’re 

excited for the 
opportunity for 

sure.”

Three plays that told the tale of the first game between ‘M’ and Purdue

For 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team, quite a bit has 
changed in 15 days. 

It 
went 
to 
in-state 
rival 

Michigan State and won by double 
digits, clung to a narrow one-point 
victory over Maryland and got its 
doors blown off at Nebraska in its 
worst performance of the season. 
While the offense has hit a bit of 
a funk, the defense has sustained 
itself as the backbone of the team.

The Wolverines are a different 

team than they were when they 
lost by a point at home to No. 3 
Purdue 15 days ago.

Thursday, we’ll find out how 

different.

Thursday, we’ll find out if 15 

days were enough to correct the 
errors that became apparent 
in the narrow defeat to the 
Boilermakers. In preparation, 
The Daily reviewed the tape 
from that game, noting three 
plays that defined the struggles 
— and arguably turned the tide — 
in the one-point loss:

1) The Play: Purdue 0, 

Michigan 0. 19:51 left in the 
first half. Purdue ball.

Center Isaac Haas stands at the 

top of the key with the ball and 
an arsenal of shooters on each 
side — each of whom essentially 
requires being face guarded at 
all times. Purdue runs an on-ball 
screen 
with 
Haas 
clipping 

Duncan Robinson after a dribble 
handoff — to try to free guard 
Dakota Mathias — and guard PJ 
Thompson screening sophomore 
point guard Zavier Simpson off 
the ball to free Carsen Edwards. 
Robinson and Simpson recover 
perfectly, fighting through the 
screens to stifle the motion. The 
pass to the wing deflects off the 
leg of Vincent Edwards, who has 
to chase back to half court to 
recover. Michigan defends to a 
T for the first 15 seconds of the 
clock.

But here’s the problem with 

defending 
Purdue’s 
shooting 

ability: They force you to defend 

for all 30 seconds, and any 
defensive lapse will be punished 
swiftly.

Mathias sets a screen off the 

ball, but doesn’t make contact 
with any defender. It doesn’t 
matter. 
Matthews, 
expecting 

to switch onto the cutter in the 
lane, loses Mathias off the ball. 
He and Robinson pick up the 
same Purdue player who cuts 
into the lane. Mathias swishes a 
warmup 3-pointer, and Purdue is 
off. Before the ball falls through 
the twine, Matthews throws his 
arms up in frustration. 

The adjustment:
There were several instances 

— largely in the first half — of 
simple 
miscommunications 

that 
resulted 
in 
Purdue 

3-pointers. 
That 
may 
seem 

easily correctable, but those 
miscommunications 
or 
failed 

rotations will only be augmented 
in 
a 
hostile 
environment. 

The 
Boilermakers 
shoot 
44 

percent from three, trailing 
only Wofford and William and 
Mary nationally. They have five 
players who shoot better from 
beyond the arc than Michigan’s 
best shooter. After the game, 
freshman forward Isaiah Livers 

said he thought the team was 
overly concerned about Haas in 
the post, to the detriment of the 
3-point defense. This cannot 
happen the second time around, 
or Purdue will simply bludgeon 
them from deep.

“You’ve 
got 
to 
just 
give 

multiple efforts on the defensive 
end,” said redshirt sophomore 
wing 
Charles 
Matthews 
on 

Wednesday 
afternoon. 
“You 

can’t just come in there and take 
away the lane and leave shooters 
all around. You can’t just say, 
‘We’re going to take the shooters 
away and leave our big on a 
7-foot-3 (guy).’ ”

Much of guarding Purdue 

requires a degree of chaos. You 
have to chase and fight through 
screens, 
hedge 
on 
shooters, 

collapse on the big, then spring 
back 
to 
the 
shooters. 
But 

controlling that chaos may be 
the key to containing the high-
octane offense. Minizimizing 
such perimeter breakdowns — 
as easy as that may be to write, 
rather than execute — could be 
the biggest key to winning the 
game.

2) The Play: Purdue 5, 

Michigan 2. 18:16 left in the 

first half. Michigan ball.

The Wolverines bring the ball 

up the court effectively amid 
some light pressure, and get into 
one of their basic sets — some 
on-ball and off-ball movement. 
Simpson gets the ball at the top 
of the key and takes a screen 
from Wagner on the right wing, 
getting the switch he wants 
with the 7-foot-3 Haas. This is a 
matchup Michigan theoretically 
wants, and will likely get again, 
assuming Purdue comes out 
switching every screen. 

But just because it wants 

this matchup does not mean its 
consistently capable of exploiting 
it. Simpson settles back into 
isolation and realizes he has no 
viable path to the hoop. Haas, 
meagerly respecting Simpson’s 
jumper, lags three steps from 
Simpson. Simpson dishes the 
ball away, only to get it right 
back in the same position with 10 
seconds on the shot clock. Trying 
to make something happen, he 
aimlessly dribbles into the lane, 
where Haas is easily able to 
recover. Wagner gets the ball, 
attacks the lane and is met at the 
rim by a camping Haas for an 
easy block.

The adjustment:
Herein lies the problem with 

this matchup. With a score-first 
guard like Trey Burke or Derrick 
Walton Jr. the Wolverines would 
be chomping at the bit to get 
Haas switched onto a guard. 
Either could simply pull up from 
3-point range, or pump fake 
and explode past the slower 
Haas. But neither Simpson nor 
senior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman 
is 
naturally 

comfortable 
generating 

consistent 
offense 
in 
the 

isolation. In a vacuum, them 
attempting to do so is not a recipe 
for this team’s success. 

“If we have Trey Burke right 

now — an experienced player 
at the point — that’s just got the 
entire package, it’s a little bit 
different,” Beilein said. “When 
they switched on McGary and 
McGary 
is 
big, 
rebounding 

inside. We said, ‘Alright Trey, 
you shoot it, Mitch, you rebound 
it.’ That was our solution.”

But 
as 
Beilein 
noted 

Wednesday, 
they 
have 
little 

choice but to try to attack those 
mismatches off the switch. He 
noted that it merely comes down 
to guards making plays on bigger 
defenders, rather than a grand 
schematic change.

3) The Play: Purdue 69, 

Michigan 69. 1:16 left in the 
game. Michigan ball.

Simpson 
started 
the 

possession with heavy pressure 
near halfcourt. With the game 
tied at 69 and just over a minute 
left, this out-of-timeout play 
respresented the closest thing 
to a “make or break” possession. 
Yet, 
as 
Simpson 
is 
being 

pressured there is little, if any, 
off ball movement. He picks up 
his dribble, and only Abdur-
Rahkman cuts toward him to 
get the ball, catching it nearly 30 
feet from the basket, and the shot 
clock dwindled down to 15. 

It seems unlikely Beilein told 

his team “Let the clock trickle, 
and get Abdur-Rahkman and 
Wagner in a pick-and-roll,” but 
that was the result. 

Finally, with eight seconds on 

the shot clock the senior guard 
dribbles into a Wagner pick, 
once again earning the switch. 
If either Abdur-Rahkman was 
confident enough to exploit Haas 
or he could get the ball to Wagner 
on the guard, a go-ahead bucket 
would seem imminent. Instead, 
a 
hesistant 
Abdur-Rahkman 

stutters right, trying to finesse 
himself free on the seven-foot 
defender. The result? An errant 
step-back, 
fadeaway 
three 

pointer that clangs the back right 
portion of the rim. 

The adjustment:
This 
play 
was 
just 
one 

of 
several 
poorly 
executed 

possessions down the stretch 
of the 70-69 loss. Michigan 
failed to score in the final 2:54 of 
this game, and while some can 
point to the referees as blame 
for the loss, a lack of late-game 
execution played a major role. 
For neither Wagner or Matthews 
to get a touch on this possession 
(Wagner didn’t touch the ball 
in the final three minutes) 
represents a negligence on the 
Wolverines’ part.

And that was not a result 

of Wagner being smothered 
defensively, either.

“Give Zavier Simpson credit, 

he almost beat us. My man didn’t 
beat us — Moe Wagner,” said 
Purdue coach Matt Painter. He 
destroyed us last year. I wasn’t 
going to watch that again. I’ve 
got all the respect in the world 
for (Simpson), but Moe Wagner 
is a stud.”

That perspective, from the 

opposing coach, about sums it up.

For a team that lacks dominant 

perimeter 
scoring, 
it 
must 

position Wagner for success on its 
most important possessions. He 
is the team’s most gifted offensive 
player, and the advantage he 
presents with his ability to stretch 
the perimeter is only amplified by 
Purdue’s plodding big men. If this 
game is close late, he must have 
the ball in his hands — or at the 
very least, be directly involved in 
the play.

Munger adjusting to 
new role as a starter

“I hate starting.”
That’s not something you 

would expect to hear from one 
of the starting guards on the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team.

But Nicole Munger prefers to 

analyze.

The junior misses the days 

of her sophomore year, when 
she would sit on the bench and 
watch. She would carefully 
observe her opponent and then 
go in and provide a break for the 
starters and, more importantly, a 
spark of energy.

But this year 

Munger 
has 

embraced her role 
as a starter — and 
playmaker — for 
the Wolverines.

“I 
think 
for 

this 
team 
to 

be 
successful, 

(Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico) wanted me 
to be in that role 
but it’s just different, just trying 
to come in and be ready very 
quickly, it took time,” Munger 
said. “The first couple times I 
was very nervous because it’s a 
different feel to the game. You 
don’t get to sit there and watch 
it and get your feet wet. I liked 
coming in when everyone else 
got a little tired and then I could 
turn up the energy.”

It took some adjusting but 

now Munger seems to be more 
comfortable. She has assisted 
Michigan in a five game winning 
streak, which included a victory 
each over rivals Ohio State and 
Michigan State.

She scored a career-high 20 

points at Ohio State on Jan. 7 and 
had another career high of five 
steals against Illinois on Jan. 20.

“She’s 
playing 
with 
an 

extreme amount of confidence,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She was an 
outstanding player last year as 
well but she didn’t have that 

same confidence and now it’s 
nice to see her growth. She’s 
doing a little bit of everything 
for us.”

Along with her role as a 

starter, Munger has also become 
Barnes Arico’s voice on the 
court.

“I’ve kind of turned to her 

a little bit as the voice of the 
team because she has great 
recognition 
and 
she 
sees 

things,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She’s a student of the game, 
she really knows the situations 
and the game a lot so I’ve been 
relying on her a lot to be a voice 
out there for our team, and I 
think she’s really embraced that 

role.”

Whenever 

Munger 
is 

subbed out, she 
sits 
directly 

next to Barnes 
Arico on the 
bench. Side-by-
side, the coach 
and her player 
break down the 
plays and their 
opponent.

“She listens to me the whole 

time as to what I’m saying,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We’re kind 
of on the same page. She thinks 
the same way that I do, she 
doesn’t say it that much so now I 
want her to say it when she’s out 
on the court. She knows what 
I’m thinking and she’s thinking 
the game the entire time. I’ve 
challenged her with becoming 
more vocal and she’s embraced 
that.”

While other teammates, like 

senior forward Jillian Dunston, 
have a fire in their belly and 
provide 
the 
energy 
to 
the 

court, Munger is clearly more 
analytical, providing a different 
dimension for the Wolverines to 
balance Dunston’s attack.

It’s a formula that seems to 

to be working, as indicated by 
the Wolverines’ success this 
season. Surely, part of that can 
be indicated to Munger, even if 
she’d prefer a different role.

“She listens to 
me the whole 
time as to what 

I’m saying.”

Sophomore guard Zavier Simpson and the other guards will need to prove more capable of driving past Purdue’s big men.
