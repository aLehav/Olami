CELEBRATING OUR ONE-HUNDRED-TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Improving the climate of the 
Business School

Residential College 
students consider 
#BlackLivesMatter 

movement

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

Though demonstrators call-

ing for an end to police brutality 
covered the Diag in December 
and marched to Ann Arbor City 
Hall in January, the #Black-
LivesMatter movement is now 
taking center stage as part of a 
new class in the Residential Col-
lege.

In response to the deaths of 

two unarmed Black men in Fer-
guson, Mo. and Staten Island, 
New York at the hands of police 
officers, the Residential College 
has developed a seminar-style 
mini-course titled “Black Lives 
Matter.” The course is designed 
to give students a space to share 
their concerns and frustrations 
over recent incidents of police 
violence.

Charlie Bright, acting direc-

tor of the Residential College, 
said the program originated 
during a meeting of faculty in 
the Residential College’s Social 
Theory and Practice major. Sev-
eral of the faculty noted the sig-
nificant amount of emotion their 
students expressed incidents 
related to police brutality .

Following a grand jury’s 

decision not to press charges 
against 
the 
Ferguson 
offi-

cer who shot and killed an 
unarmed Black man, students 
held a vigil on the Diag and 
later organized a “die-in” in 
front of the Crisler Center after 
Winter Commencement.

“There was a realization 

among us that an interdisci-
plinary program like ours had 
resources and perspectives to 
bring to bear on the issues raised, 
and the learning community of 
the RC had the framework to 
foster a thoughtful conversa-
tion about the concerns students 
shared,” Bright said.

dar, a student in the class, said 

Former fraternity 

members must 
vacate chapter 
house by May 3 

By EMMA KERR

Daily News Editor

The University’s chapter of 

Sigma Alpha Mu was suspended 
and permanently closed by the 
fraternity’s international board 
of directors following its partici-
pation in a January ski trip that 
resulted in property damages val-
ued at more than $250,000.

In an e-mail to The Michigan 

Daily, SAM Executive Director 
Leland Manders wrote that resi-
dents currently living in the SAM 
house on Oxford Road will be 
forced to move out by May 3. He 
said he could not discuss future 
plans for the house.

Current 
University 
chap-

ter members will be placed on 
alumni status as a result of the 
board’s vote. According to Man-
ders, alumni status means that 
the members cannot affiliate 

with another chapter, do not have 
the rights associated with under-
graduate membership and are 
ineligible for SAM scholarships.

A press release sent to The 

Michigan Daily from the fraterni-
ty’s national headquarters stated 
that the actions of the University 
chapter violated SAM’s values 
and standards of conduct.

According to the national 

office’s 
press 
release, 
senior 

members of the University’s SAM 
chapter refused to cooperate in 
the national office’s investigation 
of the incident, particularly by 
refusing to name the members 
involved in the ski trip and van-
dalism and the lack of action from 
bystanders in attempting to halt 
the vandalism.

“It is regrettable that these 

vandals, as well as the officers of 
the chapter decided that avoiding 
personal accountability and/or 
university sanctions took prior-
ity over the welfare of the entire 
chapter; their lack of cooperation 
led to the university’s withdrawal 
of recognition of the entire chap-
ter for a four-year period,” the 
release read. “Sigma Alpha Mu 

Arab Heritage Month 

event embraces 
unique identities

By SAMIHA MATIN

Daily Staff Reporter

In honor of the University’s 

second annual Arab Heritage 
Month, about 70 students gath-
ered in Rackham Amphitheater 

Tuesday evening for a keynote 
address by Sa’ed Atshan, a post-
doctoral fellow at Brown Uni-
versity, about coming out as a 
gay Palestinian.

Atshan has served as a lectur-

er for peace and justice studies 
at several universities includ-
ing Harvard, Brown and Tufts. 
Besides his work advocating for 
Palestinian rights, Atshan is also 
an active member of Al-Qaws, 
an organization that promotes 

LGBTQ rights in Palestinian 
society.

Sponsored by the Trotter 

Multicultural Center, Arab Her-
itage Month provides a platform 
for students to embrace their 
Arab identities.

This year’s theme, “Arabiyon 

Ana: I am Arab,” was chosen to 
explore multiple aspects of Arab 
identities and their impacts and 
influences in the world.

Daily reporters 
ride along with 

Ann Arbor officers

By DAILY STAFF

Daily staff reporters filled the 

passenger seats of Ann Arbor 
Police Department and Universi-
ty of Michigan Police Department 
cars throughout the day Tuesday 
to get a taste of officers’ experi-
ences on one of the most notori-

ously rowdy holidays of the the 
year — St. Patrick’s Day.

Each reporter was assigned to 

an officer with whom they would 
spend the next few hours.

7:00 a.m.
St. Patrick’s day shifts began 

early. With bars such as the Blue 
Leprechaun, Ashley’s and Conor 
O’Neills opening as early as 7 a.m., 
AAPD Lt. Renee Bush met fellow 
officers at 6 a.m. by the Cube to 
divide and conquer over bagels.

For the alcohol prevention 

team, St. Patrick’s Day began 

when the Ann Arbor police, along 
with volunteers from the Univer-
sity programs Beyond the Diag 
and Expect Respect, met to hand 
out cream cheese and bagels along 
with fliers that provided tips on 
how to “Stay in the Blue.”

The group divided the bagels, 

split up and headed to their 
respective 
locations, 
focusing 

on popular bars. At 7 a.m. people 
were already lined up to take part 
in this day of drinking and merri-
ment; there was a line of about 20 
people in front of the Blue Lep-

rechaun, and an estimated 60 in 
front of both Ashley’s and Conor 
O’Neills.

While the intent of giving out 

breakfast to the public was to help 
keep people who planned to drink 
in safe health, the gesture sug-
gested the public and the police 
work together on major holidays 
to ensure safety for all celebrat-
ing.

After handing out the bagels, 

groups reconvened in the Michi-
gan Union to discuss how every-

STUDENT PETITION

Rodney Cohen, director of the 

Afro-American Cultural Center at 
Yale University, resigned almost a 
month after 147 students signed 
a petition asking for his removal, 
the Yale Daily News reported.

A campus-wide e-mail from 

Yale College Dean Jonathan Hol-
loway sent Monday informed stu-
dents that Cohen had resigned 
after findings revealed his vision 
for the cultural center did not 
align with the community’s.

Complaints against Cohen had 

already been lobbied after his 
first semester in 2010, said peti-
tion organizer Micah Jones. The 
most recent petition discussed 
complaints about Cohen, includ-
ing him rarely being present at the 
house and not making funding 

opportunities easily accessible to 
students. The petition ultimately 
called for Cohen to step down.

In a statement to the Yale Daily 

News from Yale’s Black Student 
Alliance, Jones said Cohen’s res-
ignation was, “the best decision 
for everyone involved” and was 
appreciated by the community.

NYU professor barred entry

Ross, a member of the Coali-

tion for Fair Labor at NYU and 
the president of NYU’s chapter 
of the American Association of 
University Professors, planned to 
research labor issues surrounding 
migrant workers on NYU’s Saadi-
yat Island campus.

The Coalition for Fair Labor 

condemned the travel ban and 
said in a statement, “The fact 
that professor Ross was barred 
from travel to the UAE, the site 
of NYU’s main ‘global network’ 
campus in Abu Dhabi, represents 
a gross violation of academic free-
dom,” The Washington Square 
News reported.

Netanyahu wins after 
tight PM race in Israel

Presidents’ Climate Commitment during the Central Student Government meeting on Tuesday in the CSG chambers .

Likud and Zionist 
Union parties must 
compete to form a 
parliament coalition

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli 

Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu appeared to fend off a strong 
challenge from the country’s 
opposition leader in parliamen-

tary elections Tuesday, emerging 
from an acrimonious campaign in 
a slightly better position to form 
Israel’s next government.

But with the sides nearly evenly 

divided, a victory by Netanyahu’s 
Likud Party still was not guaran-
teed. His chief rival, Isaac Herzog 
of the Zionist Union, said he would 
make “every effort” to form a gov-
ernment, and an upstart centrist 
party led by a former Netanyahu 
ally-turned-rival was set to be 

the kingmaker. The country now 
heads into what could be weeks of 
negotiations over the makeup of 
the next coalition.

Both Netanyahu and Herzog 

will now compete for a chance to 
form a coalition that commands 
a majority in the 120-seat parlia-
ment, a daunting task in Israel’s 
fractured political landscape. 

Netanyahu appeared to have a 

better chance of cobbling together 
a government with right-wing and 
religious parties that he calls his 
“natural allies.” Herzog would 
have to appeal to more ideologi-
cally diverse parties.

Either will likely need the sup-

port of Moshe Kahlon, whose new 
Kulanu party captured nine or 10 
seats, according to polls. Kahlon, 
whose campaign focused almost 
entirely on bread-and-butter eco-
nomic issues, refused to take sides.

“I am loyal to my way,” he told 

his supporters, saying he would 
work to form a government com-
mitted to social justice.

The election was widely seen as 

a referendum on Netanyahu, who 
has governed the country for the 
past six years, and recent opinion 
polls had given Herzog a slight 
lead.

As the results were announced 

on the nation’s three major TV 
stations, celebrations erupted at 
Likud’s campaign headquarters in 
Tel Aviv.

“Against all the odds we 

obtained a great victory for the 
Likud,” Netanyahu told the gath-
ering. “Now we must form a 
strong and stable government that 
will ensure Israel’s security and 
welfare,” he added, in comments 
aimed at Kahlon.

He said he had already been in 

touch with all other nationalist 
parties in hopes of quickly form-
ing a coalition.

Netanyahu focused his cam-

paign on security issues, while 
his opponents instead pledged to 
address the country’s high cost of 
living and accused the leader of 
being out of touch with everyday 
people.

Sustainability efforts

at the University

The LSA Student Government’s 

Taking 
Responsibility 
for 

the 
Earth 
and 
Environment 

subcommittee 
presented 
a 

resolution 
to 
encourage 
the 

University 
and 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
to 

sign the American College and 
University Presidents’ Climate 
Commitment.

The 
ACUPCC 
is 
an 

undertaking 
by 
a 
network 

of colleges and universities 
to 
address 
global 
climate 

change. Signatories pledge to 
eliminate net greenhouse gas 
emissions from certain campus 
operations 
and 
encourage 

institutions of higher learning 
to 
conduct 
research 
and 

educate society on how to 
better the climate.

LSA freshman Joseph Hansel, 

an 
LSA 
student 
government 

representative, spoke on behalf of 
the organization at the meeting 
Tuesday.

Hansel said for a university to 

join the network, it must agree to 
meet at least two of seven actions 
to reduce greenhouse gases as 

outlined by the ACUPCC. He said 
the University currently meets 
two of these tenets with certainty, 
and possibly a third.

“The tenets that we currently 

practice 
strongly 
are 
public 

transportation being available 
to all faculty, staff, visitors 
and students, along with our 
participation in Recyclemania,” 
Hansel said.

Recyclemania is a competition 

designed to bolster university 
recycling programs.

The Ohio State University, the 

University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign and the University of 
California, Berkeley, are among 
more than 690 schools that have 
already signed the commitment.

“The ACUPCC does offer a 

network of different universities 
that we are in close contact with,” 
Hansel said. “We plan to work 
with all three of those schools to 
examine how we can take their 
sustainability practices and either 
amend them or apply them to our 
University to make us the most 
sustainable campus that we can 
be.”

He said CSG support for this

secure jobs and housing. The 
organization would steward the 
money, rather than give the funds 
to the Chavez’s directly.

Funkhouser wrote in a Face-

book post that people claiming 
to be Mat Chavez’s relatives had 
contacted him, warning that the 
couple was on the street because 
of drug use, not due to an illness 
that resulted in a lost job and ulti-
mately homelessness. He added 
that he had reached out directly 
to Danielle Chavez’s family, who 
corroborated this story and said 
the couple should not receive the 
money.

“If Mat and Danielle are on 

drugs and not responsible with 
what they are given or are not 
willing to accept the help that is 
offered, the charity would use 
the money towards helping the 
homeless community of Ann 
Arbor,” he said.

The Michigan Daily could not 

confirm these comments from 
family members. Mat Chavez 
declined to comment Tuesday 
afternoon.

Funkhouser noted that he has 

no proof of the allegations and 
does not know if they are true, 
but felt that he had to inform the 
donors because he doesn’t want 
them to feel deceived.

“I don’t have any, like, cold 

hard evidence either way,” Funk-
houser said in an interview with 
the Daily. “I just know what Mat 
and Danielle have said. And I 
know what the people that know 
them and other people have said. 
As of right now I don’t know 
what’s true and what’s not true.”

Before deciding to leave the 

money in care of a non-profit, 
Funkhouser laid out new options 
for donating the money raised. 
These included giving the money 
to Danielle’s parents to start a col-
lege fund for the Chavez’ daugh-
ters, giving the money directly 
to the couple, or refunding the 
donors — though he would have 
to check if this is possible and, if 
so, to what extent. He asked for 
donors’ feedback to determine 
which option he would choose.

Funkhouser said he personally 

thought giving the money to the 
charity would be the best option. 
From his Facebook post, he 
explained that the money would 
still go toward helping the rest of 

Ann Arbor’s homeless communi-
ty if the Chavez couple is not eli-
gible to receive funding through 
the charity.

He added that most of the peo-

ple who contacted him after he 
posted the update on social media 
and the fundraising page agreed 
that this would be the best course 
of action.

“I don’t want anyone who 

donated or anyone who helped 
out with this to feel bad about 
happened because we still have 
the chance to make the money go 
to a really good cause,” he said. 
“We just have to figure out that 
cause now. So it’s a little disap-
pointing but it’s not the end.”

Funkhouser said the new 

developments were disappoint-
ing because the campaign had 
seemed to be so successful and 
for a good cause.

“The original goal of this cam-

paign was to help a homeless 
family get off of the streets and 
this solution will do that, wheth-
er that be Mat and Danielle or 
another family,” he wrote on the 
fundraising page. “I believe that 
by giving the money to a charity 
that is experienced in these types 
of situations is the most respon-
sible decision at this time.”

the course incorporates many dif-
ferent subjects, including socio-
economic 
class, 
environment, 

policing and colonial history.

“Through it, I feel that every-

one that participates learns about 
the historical and methodological 
underpinnings to many intersec-
tions of the Black Lives Matter 
movement; I know I have,” Razdar 
said.

The course began in February 

and will end in April, culminating 
with a panel discussion involving 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel and LSA Dean Andrew Martin. 
The panel will allow students and 
faculty to discuss the University’s 
plans to improve inclusion and 
diversity on campus — topics that 
have been a focus of campus con-
versation in the last two years. In 
November 2013, members of the 
University’s Black Student Union 
launched 
the 
#BBUM 
Twit-

ter campaign —which garnered 

national recognition— to allow 
students to share their experienc-
es as Black students on campus.

Each session focuses on a dif-

ferent sub-topic, organized to 
encourage discussion among stu-
dents. The four course sessions to 
date have each dealt with a differ-
ent aspect of racial inequality in 
contemporary society.

The first half of each class in 

the course includes a presentation 
given by a Residential College fac-
ulty member and a guest speaker. 
Lectures so far have included 
“Police Violence in Black America: 
Past and Present” and “Bad Jobs, 
Black Lives and Young Workers.” 
After the presentation, students 
break into smaller groups to dis-
cuss the material and reconvene 
as a class to report back on their 
conversations.

Razdar said the course empow-

ers students, community members 
and experts in the field to all learn 
from each other.

“Most of all I will take with me 

powerful knowledge which I can 
use both in my studies and activ-

ism,” he said.

In an interview with the col-

lege’s blog, LSA Today, LSA junior 
Gina Goldfaden said she enrolled 
in the course because she wanted 
to discuss issues surrounding 
inequality with a wide range of 
people.

“I enrolled in the course 

because I wanted the opportunity 
to have an extended dialogue on 
race, discrimination and social 
inequities with other students,” 
Goldfaden said. “The collabo-
ration between a wide range of 
people from, in and around the 
University made me feel as though 
everyone was welcome to learn, 
share and discuss.”

Bright said the class aims to 

open the floor for student discus-
sion, rather than provide answers 
to problems.

“We’ll discuss the problems 

raised by police violence and of 
the reactions of undergraduates 
— their fears and frustrations in 
trying to grapple with the implica-
tions they see in these incidents of 
police violence,” he said.

worked in cooperation with uni-
versity officials and regretfully 
agreed with their request to close 
the chapter.”

At the conclusion of the Uni-

versity’s judicial process in Feb-
ruary, the University announced 
it would no longer recognize SAM 
as a campus organization. The 
University also requested that the 
national office revoke the chapter 
and take further sanctions.

Sigma Delta Tau, the sorority 

that accompanied SAM on the trip 
to Treetops Resort in Gaylord, was 
placed on a two-year disciplinary 
suspension by the University.

Four other Greek life chapters 

also faced sanctions for damages 

to the Boyne Highlands Resort in 
Harbor Springs during the same 
weekend, but the University’s dis-
ciplinary proceedings determined 
those damages were not inten-
tional.

In the weeks following the 

incident, CSG President Bobby 
Dishell, a Public Policy senior; 
Interfraternity Council President 
Alex Krupiak, an LSA senior; and 
Panhellenic Association Presi-
dent Maddy Walsh, a Business 
junior, released a public apology 
on behalf of SAM and the other 
organizations involved.

Dishell said in a statement on 

behalf of CSG that the decision of 
SAM’s international board is an 
important step in ensuring justice 
for those involved in the incident.

“We commend the Univer-

sity for remaining proactive in 

its investigation and for hold-
ing the involved organizations 
accountable,” he wrote Tuesday. 
“We hope to continue working 
with the administration, and we 
look forward to achieving greater 
reparative progress in the weeks 
and months ahead.”

In a statement on behalf of IFC, 

Krupiak noted that the ski trip 
incidents were unfortunate and 
disappointing.

“Sigma Alpha Mu is not a fra-

ternity recognized by IFC any-
more as a result of the university’s 
ruling a few weeks ago,” he said. 
“We are confident that the Greek 
community will move forward 
from these events and will con-
tinue to have a positive impact on 
this campus.”

Guest speaker Ron Scott, spokesperson for the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, discusses his personal 
experiences with racial history in Detroit during the fifth meeting of the mini course “Black Lives Matter” in East Quad on 
Monday. 

“This keynote address was par-

ticularly chosen because it was 
a really good way of tying in the 
way a person’s queer identity can 
affect their Arab identity,” said 
event organizer Farah Erzouki, a 
Public Health student. “We want-
ed to explore those interactions 
between two such marginalized 
identities.”

During 
his 
speech, 
Atshan 

shared his story about struggling 
to come to terms with his sexuality.

“I, 
alongside 
others, 
were 

constantly accused of being per-
verts,” Atshan said. “People failed 
to see that homosexual love is 
between two consenting adults.”

Atshan also addressed how his 

sexuality affected his family.

“Coming out as gay created 

repercussions for my family,” 
Atshan said. “The family honor 
was tied to my decisions. This is 
because sexuality is a topic that 
doesn’t come often in the public 
forum, especially in the Middle 
East.”

Atshan is involved in several 

efforts to create a safer environ-
ment for the LGBTQ community, 
such as organizing the first Glob-
al Queer Palestinian Solidarity 
Movement.

Atshan also briefly discussed 

Palestinian living conditions in 
the West Bank territory.

“Their freedom is taken away 

from them,” Atshan said. “There 
is 
segregation 
everywhere 

between the Palestinians and the 
Israelites. Palestinian children 
come home to find their houses 
demolished, unarmed women and 
children are constantly interro-
gated by Israeli soldiers. It’s abso-

lutely heartbreaking.”

Atshan concluded his speech 

by congratulating members of 
Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality and the University’s 
chapter of Students for Justice 
in Palestine for launching cam-
paigns to encourage the Boycott, 
Divestment and Sanctions move-
ment on campus, as well as for the 
opening of Edward Said Lounge 
in North Quad Residence Hall.

“It’s important to talk about 

Palestinians and intersectionali-
ties in an Arab context,” said LSA 
junior Hind Omar. “Events like 
these definitely create awareness, 
and there needs to be more about 
it. Palestine is a topic that nobody 
can avoid anymore.”

Other Arab Heritage Month 

events include the Ann Arbor Pal-
estine film festival, belly dance 
lessons and a group discussion on 
sexuality.

thing went and ways to improve 
next year.

Bryan Baker, the University’s 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security’s liaison to the Office of 
Student Life, said he was happy 
with the way their initiative 
turned out.

“I thought the bagels went real-

ly well this morning,” Baker said. 
“The students and the audience 
that we were trying to reach were 
very receptive to the messaging of 
us having them think before they 
drink and get some food in their 
bellies before they go out and have 
any type of alcohol.”

Students were the targeted 

audience of the campaign, but 
Lt. Bush handed the bagels with 
attached safety fliers out to anyone 
who wanted them.

“It’s an important message no 

matter how old you are,” Bush 
said. “We don’t want anyone going 
to the hospital or getting hurt — 
nothing is worth that.”

In addition to this event, last 

Saturday, the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter held a bystander interven-
tion training session, hosted by 
Beyond the Diag at the Luther 
Buchele Cooperative House. The 
aim of these programs was to help 
inform students on how to react 
to potential dangerous situations 
and stay safe during the holiday 
and the weekend following.

Baker said the outreach done 

this year, such as the free bagels, 
will continue next year. He 
reported the number of students 
drinking in the dorms the Satur-
day prior to St. Patrick’s Day was 
down by 50 percent from last year, 
but noted that Dance Marathon 
being held Saturday through Sun-
day was a contributing factor.

“I think that we will continue 

on with these types of educational 
efforts and really getting out there 
and talking to the community.” 
Baker said.

After the discussion was over, 

Bush went back to her duties as an 
officer and patrolled the streets, 
making sure to pass all of the pop-
ular bars and observe the crowd 
size in and out of the bars.

By 9 a.m., the lines were gone 

and the bars were full. HopCat 
and Scorekeepers did not open 
until later on in the day, but Bush 
said that in previous years she 
remembers lines down the block 
in front of Scorekeepers, and that 
the amount of people out on St. 
Patrick’s day is really dependent 
on the weather and day the holi-
day falls on.

1:45 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.

During the day, campus was 

quiet and most students attended 
class. AAPD Officer Jaime Craw-
ford was assigned to traffic patrol 
as usual. She left the department 
around 1:45 p.m. and began her 
patrol.

Not following a specific route, 

Crawford spent her traffic patrols 
cruising around town. Sometimes, 
she parked and used her speed 
laser to catch speeding cars.

While most of the time on traf-

fic patrol is spent driving around 
and looking for disobedience to 
traffic laws, Crawford was con-
stantly on the lookout for abnor-
mal behavior.

On holidays like St. Patrick’s 

Day, officers like Crawford look 

for students who are displaying 
disorderly conduct.

“We’re 
looking 
for 
people 

that can’t handle themselves, are 
stumbling and putting their own 
safety at risk,” Crawford said.

The difference between issuing 

an Minor in Possession and deliv-
ering a warning is a gray area for 
many officers, Crawford said, not-
ing that student interaction with 
the officer plays a big role.

“Compliance and respectful-

ness can go a long way. The way 
you respond can determine if you 
get a ticket or not,” Crawford said.

Crawford said she specifically 

looks for students who are posing 
danger to themselves. Though if 
the police see a house party, they 
will not always choose to inter-
vene.

“We’ll address parties if we get 

a complaint,” Crawford said. “We 
will also proactively make contact 
with a party if it’s spilling out onto 
the street, blocking pedestrian or 
foot traffic, if people are throw-
ing glass or displaying destructive 
behavior, or if there are fights.”

Back at the station, there are 

holding cells for civilians that 
have been arrested and may be 
taken to jail. Bush said though it is 
not common, belligerent students 
have been brought to these cells in 
the past.

“Generally we write tickets, 

unless they’re really assaultive, in 
which case we bring them back 
here,” Bush said.

St. Patrick’s Day has tended 

to be a busier holiday when it 
comes to tickets given out. The 
holiday is infamous for having a 
large amount of house parties and 
underage drinking. Bush said she 
believes this is due to the arrival of 
warmer weather.

“Well, it is a holiday, and we do 

have people that want to celebrate 
that holiday,” Bush said. “Christ-
mas, students are gone, and same 
with Thanksgiving. This is a sign 
of spring, and people have cabin 
fever; they want to get out of their 
apartments and dorms and have 
fun.”

3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.

Officer Dennis DeGrand left 

the Ann Arbor Police Department 
for his midday patrol at approxi-
mately 3 p.m.

Just 25 minutes into his shift, 

Officer DeGrand was dispatched 
to the scene of an assault near the 
entrance of the Main Street Party 
Store. Two witnesses described 
the altercation: an intoxicated 
white male directed racial slurs at 
a man before punching him twice.

Both parties involved left the 

scene before Officer DeGrand 
arrived. The witnesses noted the 
assailant may have proceeded to 
enter the Heidelberg Restaurant 
down the street. The establish-
ment’s bouncers said that he was 
denied at the door.

Approximately one hour later, 

the officer received a call about a 
male lying semi-conscious on the 
couch inside Bubble Island. Upon 
arrival, paramedics were alrea dy 
on the scene, transporting a stu-
dent on a stretcher into the ambu-
lance.

Several of his friends on the 

street noticed, and tried to plead 
with the officer and paramedics 
that he was fine, and asked they be 
allowed to take him home. They 
were rebuffed by the officer.

“He’s incapacitated, passed out 

in a business, unable to take care 
of himself. So we need to take him 

into protective custody,” DeGrand 
said.

MIPs are very common among 

students, while DUIs and other 
forms of alcohol arrests are less 
common among students.

“It’s not usually college students 

drinking and driving because they 
either walk or catch a cab to the 
bars,” DeGrand said. “It’s usually 
out-of-towners, who come into 
town to drink at the bars and then 
drive afterwards. If you’re in the 
drunk tank, it’s usually because 
you’ve been fighting or disorderly 
conduct. If you’re just drunk and 
haven’t done anything wrong 
you’ll go to the hospital.”

7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

By the evening, things seemed 

to be settled down.

Tony Ricco of the University 

Police saw no St. Patrick’s Day-
related mischief during his shift.

A member of UMPD for 12.5 

years, Ricco described patrolling 
the streets as 90 percent quiet and 
10 percent excitement.

Ricco noted that there is 

increased enforcement for drunk 
driving on St. Patrick’s Day in Ann 
Arbor, though he issued no arrests 
during this time frame.

Though he did spot a notice-

ably drunk man stumbling by the 
Power Center, he did not con-
front him because the man was 
not causing harm to others and 
appeared over the legal drinking 
age.

As a UMPD officer, Ricco spent 

much of his night in University 
buildings; he helped turn off a 
fire alarm in Schembechler Hall, 
patrolled the mostly empty hall-
ways of Angel and Mason Halls 
for non-students, faculty or staff 
members and also circled Michi-
gan Stadium and Crisler Arena.

His unique role as a University 

officer means that only University 
buildings and the streets adjacent 
to those buildings are within his 
jurisdiction, excluding Ann Arbor 
city bars, shops and even frater-
nity houses from his daily respon-
sibilities.

At the same time, Officer 

Anthony Petterle was on duty 
starting at 7:00 p.m. for the AAPD. 
Petterle, with the force for about 
three years now, said AAPD and 
UMPD work well together, help-
ing each other when necessary 
and thus better serving the com-
munity.

Petterle worked the second-lat-

est shift of the day, the last being 
the “party patrol,” which is usu-
ally reserved for weekends and 
game day evenings.

Much like for Ricco, Petterle 

didn’t have to attend to St. Paddy’s 
shenanigans between 7:00 p.m. and 
10:00 p.m. Petterle responded to a 
call about a domestic issue, issued 
a ticket for an expired license plate 
and helped get a car towed that was 
blocking a driveway.

Along Main Street and Hill 

Street, green-clad students moved 
peacefully to the bars or back 
home. Petterle said he was basi-
cally looking to “keep the peace.”

“A lot of people think we’re 

out here just trying to slam every 
single person we come into for an 
MIP or whatever, but most of the 
time we’re actually out here just 
making sure everyone’s having 
fun but being safe,” he said.

initiative would show Schlissel 
that students are united in their 
support for campus sustainability, 
and 
would 
subsequently 

encourage 
him 
to 
sign 
the 

commitment.

The proposal was referred to 

the resolutions committee.

MUSIC Matters asks CSG 

for sponsorship

Business senior Darren Appel, 

MUSIC Matters president, also 
presented a resolution asking 
CSG to provide funding for the 
MUSIC Matters 2015 concert and 
SpringFest.

Since 2011, MUSIC Matters, 

one 
of 
the 
largest 
student 

organizations at the University, 

has planned a day of festivities 
in the spring to raise money for 
philanthropic initiatives. In the 
organization’s first three years, 
it raised $10,000 for C.S. Mott 
Children’s 
hospital, 
$50,000 

for a need-based scholarship at 
the University and planned a 
leadership camp at the University 
for Detroit children.

Appel said the festival would 

unite 
the 
entire 
University 

campus.

“The idea behind SpringFest is 

that we have this decentralized 
campus — it allows everybody to 
come together for one day and 
sort of bring the campus and 
celebrate the University,” he said.

Several other campus student 

organizations will be involved in 
the event, which will include a 
“Shark Tank” pitch competition, 

a sustainability zone, live music, a 
fashion show and food trucks.

“This 
festival 
brings 

between 40 and 50 student 
organizations 
together 
and 

celebrates everything that they’ve 
accomplished in an interactive 
way to engage with the students,” 
Appel said.

In 
the 
resolution, 
MUSIC 

Matters requested a total of 
$8,000 from CSG — $4,000 from 
its 
Legislative 
Discretionary 

Account and $4,000 from its 
Sponsored Activities fund.

Appel said this amount would 

render CSG an official sponsor 
of the event; CSG gave MUSIC 
Matters $10,000 for its 2014 event.

The proposal was referred to 

the finance committee.

I

magine, for a moment, the University 
suddenly devoid of women. All female 
students, 
professors, 
staff 
members 

and administrators vanish 
from campus. A multitude 
of seats in lecture halls 
and classrooms would be 
vacant. A number of classes 
would lack instruction from 
professors. 
Administra-

tive issues would remain 
unresolved. The progress of 
research projects and initia-
tives would slacken. Dining 
halls would operate under-
staffed. Portions of on-cam-
pus residences — without 
the contributions of staff members — would 
remain unkempt. Student organizations and 
committees across campus would struggle to 
function without a vast portion of their mem-
bers and their leadership. Without its female 
writers, copy editors, videographers, design-
ers, photographers and editors, the publi-
cation you’re currently reading would lack 
content to provide to the student population. 
In short, the University, as it currently stands, 
would struggle to function during this hypo-
thetical scenario.

Although the scenario I describe above is 

merely my own personal musing, March 8, 
on International Women’s Day, women van-
ished from advertisements, posters, publica-
tions and billboards throughout New York 
City in an effort to raise awareness of the 
gender inequality continuing to permeate our 
society. Sponsored by the Clinton Founda-
tion, the disappearance of female bodies, in 
combination with displaying the web address 
Not-There.org, was meant to call attention to 
data compiled by the foundation’s No Ceil-
ings initiative to measure and gauge the 
worldwide condition of all women. By enter-
ing the web address into a 
browser, members of the 
public were able to view 
a female celebrity-filled 
YouTube video explain-
ing the disappearances, 
and they were presented 
with the opportunity to 
discover alarming facts 
and figures regarding the 
contemporary magnitude 
of gender inequality.

Aptly titled, the cam-

paign illustrates that gender equality remains 
out of reach for women throughout the globe. 
Of the numerous facts given to describe the 
current state of inequality, the website notes 
that the United States stands as “one of nine 
countries worldwide that doesn’t provide for 
paid maternity leave.” Highlighting the danger-
ous prevalence of violence against women, the 
No Ceilings initiative provides the statistic that 
“one in three women suffers physical or sexual 
violence” within society. The site also address-
es issues surrounding the gender pay gap, inac-
cessibility to education, Internet service and 
child marriage. According to an estimate from 
the Clinton Foundation, “the Not There website 
had been viewed at least 104, 680 times” as of 
the evening of March 8.

Gathering data and promoting a forum of 

discussion is crucial to making progress for 
women’s rights. Succeeding in its attempt to 
capture attention and garner support for equal-
ity among genders, the Not There campaign is 
certainly a poignant and powerful one. Katie 
Dowd, the director of digital strategy at the 
Clinton Foundation, noted in an interview that 
one of the goals of the campaign was “to cre-
ate a moment that feels meaningful.” However, 
no matter how revolutionary the campaign was 

in its commencement last week, the commit-
ment to dismantling gender inequality must not 
remain limited to a single day. The effect of this 
campaign shouldn’t just be a noteworthy news 
event with a notoriety that fizzles out over time.

In addition to the mysterious departure of 

women from newsstands and advertisements, 
another component of the campaign featured 
erasing the voices of females from contempo-
rary music featured across roughly 186 radio 
stations owned by iHeartMedia across the 
nation. As a heavy critic of the usually over-
sexualized and over-photoshopped manner in 
which women are often portrayed in ads and 
magazines anyway, I found this removal of 
voices to be more significant. In my opinion, 
demonstrating the lack of voices is more impor-
tant than a lack of today’s societal depictions.

Providing spaces for women’s voices to be 

heard is instrumental to achieving true equal-
ity. In regards to remedying the ridiculous pay 
gap between men and women, I have often 
heard cultivating a larger number of women 
in STEM fields proposed as a solution. More 
women in STEM careers, as suggested by an 
article on the No Ceilings initiative’s website, 
would propel women into “some of the fastest 
growing, best paying, and highest-need fields 
in today’s economy.” Increasing the number of 
women in these careers would most likely aid 
in alleviating the pay gap as women with STEM 
careers earn 33 percent more than their female 
counterparts in other sections of the workforce.

However, the pay gap is merely one issue, 

and equality isn’t obtained from the shifting of 
a comma on a paycheck. Women, in numerous 
fields, are absent from positions of leadership. 
According to the Center for American Progress, 
they possess 52 percent of all professional-level 
jobs, yet only 14.6 percent of American women 
hold executive officer positions. Women, in a 
profitable sector of the economy such as the 
legal field, consist of 45.4 percent of associ-

ates. Yet just 25 percent of 
women maintain the sta-
tus of non-equity partners, 
while a mere 15 percent of 
women are equity partners 
at a firm. Returning once 
again to the influential mar-
ket of advertising, women 
constitute three percent of 
creative directors. In other 
fields where shaping mes-
sages and opinion is at the 
forefront, men continue to 

dominate. Women in the film industry com-
prise only 16 percent of the directors, executive 
producers, producers, writers, cinematogra-
phers and actors responsible for creating the 
most profitable films in 2013. If this percentage 
were increased, more complex, intriguing and 
independent female characters would appear 
in our narratives.

To move women toward our desired desti-

nation in society, we absolutely need to under-
stand the data, raise awareness of the issues to 
both men and women and recognize the role 
women play in our world. However, rather than 
take away images of women, the next step needs 
to involve re-imagining the role women play in 
our society. We need women in the advertis-
ing, marketing and communication realms to 
continue redefining societal notions of woman-
hood. We need female representation in gov-
ernment and public policy to enact legislation 
necessary to improve overall living conditions 
for women. We need women with vast techno-
logical knowledge to continue advancing soci-
ety. To achieve equality, society, overall, needs 
women in sectors and roles that are diverse.

O

n Saturday, March 7, a video 
was leaked of students 
from the University of 

Oklahoma’s 
Sigma 
Alpha 

Epsilon fraternity 
chapter 
singing 

a 
racist 
chant 

in 
unison. 
The 

chant 
included 

claims that Black 
students 
could 

never be a part 
of the fraternity, 
using the n-word 
and 
making 
a 

reference to lynching: “You can 
hang him from a tree, but he’ll never 
sign with me. There will never be a 
***** in SAE.”

Since the incident, the University 

of Oklahoma’s SAE chapter has been 
suspended by the university and its 
national chapter. Two students who 
were identified as leading this chant 
have been expelled.

The video is blatantly racist. 

Students 
lightheartedly 
chanted 

about lynching, an act that is a 
reminder of America’s grim white-
supremacist past, making it clear 
that the sentiments are in no way 
eradicated from our present-day 
society. Lynching was a way to strike 
fear into the hearts of the Black 
community both during and after 
the post-Civil War, to make them 
feel weak and like they would never 
be equal. To bring such a gruesome 
image back into the minds of Black 
Americans is unsettling, especially 
in this day and age.

This incident was extremely 

shocking and eye-opening for many 
people 
throughout 
the 
nation, 

although in the eyes of many within 
the Black community, the only thing 
unique about this incident is that it 
was recorded. Megan Johnson, a 
Black student from the University of 

Oklahoma stated, “Personally I was 
outraged, I was upset, but shocked 
was not an emotion that I had … 
These 
racist 
situations 
happen 

every day and we encounter them. 
It took this group of students to be 
on camera and caught for it to get 
national attention.”

The incidence that was caught on 

tape goes beyond just the actions and 
beliefs of a few fraternity brothers 
on a bus. Rather, this was a small 
reflection of much of the racism 
that is still prevalent within the 
United States today. Although many 
Americans still deny that racism is 
a prevalent issue in America, racial 
inequality 
exists 
in 
education, 

the criminal justice system and 
finances, among others according to 
a Pew report.

Racism 
infringes 
upon 
the 

rights of Black 
Americans, even 
at a young age. 
Black 
children 

are more likely 
to be suspended 
for 
the 
same 

infringement 
as their white 
counterparts, 
— 
even 
in 

preschool — and 
are more likely 
to be placed in juvenile detention 
throughout their schooling. This 
severely limits their ability to reach 
higher education, which is already 
impeded by the history of racism 
in America, which includes slavery 
and Jim Crow laws.

The hope that many rely on is the 

idea that the upcoming generations 
are more racially accepting and 
open-minded than people of the 
previous 
generations. 
Although 

this generation is statistically the 
most diverse thus far, the reality, 
as highlighted by this incident, 

is that whites within upcoming 
generations may not be as racially 
accepting 
as 
many 
may 
have 

previously thought.

An evaluation of racial stereotype 

battery in the 2012 American 
National 
Election 
Study 
shows 

that 61 percent of white Americans 
under 30 view whites as more 
intelligent and hardworking than 
Black Americans, almost as much as 
their older counterparts; 64 percent 
of those 31 and older believe white 
Americans are more intelligent.

As a community, it’s important 

to realize that racism still is very 
much alive today, and that the Civil 
Rights Movement didn’t end with a 
happily ever after just because we 
have a Black president. It includes 
every instance of racism that occurs 
in society today and it begins and 

ends with our 
actions. 
Many 

people 
have 

ignored 
the 

institutional 
racism 
and 

police brutality 
prevalent 
in 

our time. We 
should 
learn 

from the stories 
of our past and 
present, and ask 

ourselves what we want to tell our 
grandchildren about.

I hope to be standing on the side 

of history that speaks for truth 
and justice. Malcolm X, a once-
misunderstood man, said, “I’m for 
truth, no matter who tells it. I’m 
for justice, no matter who it is for 
or against. I’m a human being, first 
and foremost, and as such I’m for 
whoever and whatever benefits 
humanity as a whole.”

The dangers of plastic

T

he 
week 
before 
Spring 

Break, 
my 
environmen-

tal psych class turned my 

whole 
world 

upside down. I’m 
sure 
any 
read-

ers out there who 
are familiar with 
environment 
or 

psychology class-
es know that a 
little information 
goes a long way to 
sending students 
down 
doomsday 

spirals. Now just 
picture these two 
topics combined into one and then 
drop in a passionate guest speaker 
and you have a clear image of what 
caused me to question everything.

Or, at least, everything I knew 

about plastic. And honestly, once 
the guest speaker opened my eyes, 
I realized I really didn’t know shit 
about plastic. Because who even 
thinks about it, really? It makes up 
my adorable reusable (and therefore 
eco-friendly, or so I thought) water 
bottle, my pitcher I use for water, my 
shampoo and conditioner containers, 
the knife-fork-spoon hybrid I eat all 
my meals with and god only knows 
what else. Plastic is everywhere and 
it’s wreaking havoc on our world and 
our bodies. No one even knows what 
it’s made of, because the people who 
make plastic do not have to disclose 
the ingredients that make it up.

For example, in the early 2000s, 

when numerous studies came out 
explaining that the chemicals in the 
BPA plastic that make up most water 
bottles and baby bottles disrupt hor-

mones and cause cancer, most people 
were quick to leap onto the BPA-free 
bandwagon. I know my family was. 
Basically, during my entire child-
hood, I instinctively knew that BPA-
free water bottles were safe.

According to a Mother Jones arti-

cle, BPA substitutes are unregulated 
chemicals made into plastic in pri-
vately owned businesses which do 
not have to release this information. 
Similarly, according to Journalist’s 
Resource, new studies have shown 
that the same endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals found in BPA can be found 
in its widely favored replacement.

This information is frighteningly 

hidden. Until plastic is more close-
ly regulated by the government, it 
will be impos-
sible to know the 
breadth of dan-
ger that comes 
from these mix-
tures of chemi-
cals. And plastic, 
the material that 
makes up throw-
away packaging 
and 
non-reus-

able 
grocery 

bags, will never 
decompose into nature because, 
“due to the nature of plastic (it) 
often can only be ‘downcycled’ rath-
er than recycled.”

Some plastic is sent to be recycled 

in developing countries, which often 
involves open-air burning. But most 
plastic doesn’t even enter the shoddy 
recycling system. Thirty-four mil-
lion tons of plastic were disposed in 
the United States in 2008, 86 per-
cent of which ended up in landfills. 

Landfills are deeply unsustainable 
and diminish land resources. Other 
options, such as incineration, dan-
gerously release carbon dioxide and 
other air pollutants.

It seems to me that the entire 

recycling and waste removal system 
needs to be revitalized. But until 
that day, try to creatively reuse plas-
tics, maybe for flower pots or pencil 
cases. However, do not eat out or off 
of them. As well as increasing our 
risk for cancer and disrupting our 
hormones when plastic leeches from 
our water bottles and plastic dining 
ware into our food and water, it’s also 
destroying the only home we have.

Change starts with a small step in 

the right direction, so switch from 

plastic to metal 
or glass today. 
I did, and my 
metal water bot-
tle holds water 
in basically the 
same way! I’m 
sure some people 
will 
read 
this 

and think I am 
crazy for putting 
so much empha-
sis on avoiding 

plastic. It’s easy to write off these 
findings as pieces of propaganda and 
insanity, but that’s just being will-
fully blind. Scientists aren’t lying. 
It’s better to take preventative steps 
now by cutting as much plastic out of 
our lives as possible. It’s the only real 
chance we have at saving this glori-
ous planet. And ourselves, too.

Decreasing 
asthma 
and 

environmental pollution 

TO THE DAILY: 

Did you know that Michigan has an asth-

ma contraction rate 10 percent higher than 
the national average, and that southwest 
Detroit has the third-most polluted zip code, 
48127, in the nation? Environmentalists have 
established a link between environmental 
pollutants and adult-onset asthma. In addi-
tion, pollution frequently induces asthma 
attacks in those who already have the disor-
der. We all directly or indirectly have people 
we know who have asthma; obviously this 
issue is immediate.

The Clean, Renewable and Efficient Energy 

Act, which requires that electric companies 
in the state of Michigan, such as DTE Energy, 
have 10 percent of their energy come from 

renewable resources, expires at the end of this 
year. The issue is that once 2015 ends, the act 
expires, and electric companies lack incentive 
to continue using renewable energy.

In order to protect those close to us, we 

should all advocate for sustainable energy pol-
icies that keep us all healthy and worry-free. 
Gov. Rick Snyder recently announced that 
he hopes to expand energy policy so that we 
get 30 to 40 percent of our power from clean 
renewables by 2025. In order to persuade the 
Michigan Legislature to vote in the affirma-
tive, he needs our help. It’s imperative that we 
all contact our legislators in order to aid Sny-
der in the passing of a renewable energy act, 
which would reduce air pollutants and thus 
asthmatic prevalence in Michigan for those 
around us and our posterity.

‘Frozen on Ice’ is 
faithful to film

Movie adaptation 
exceeds writer’s 

expectations

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

“Why are you going home 

this weekend?”

“I’m going to ‘Frozen on 

Ice,’ ” I said, 
straight-faced. 
I don’t mess 
around 
when 

it comes to the 
“awesomely 
cool” 
new 

age 
classic 

(the 
tickets 

were free, so 
that didn’t hurt either). But no 
matter the ticket price, it was 
certainly a spectacle worth 
seeing.

Before the show at The 

Palace, a cast of classic Disney 
characters glided across the 
ice gracefully to get the child-
dominated crowd prepped for 
the show. Princes, princesses, 
lions, fish and a nightmarish 
Pumba did rounds with their 
specific theme songs before 
the show got underway. Mickey 
began to tell Minnie (let the 
record show that they are 
married, 
NOT 
brother 
and 

sister, as I have thought my 
entire life) a story about true 
love, between sisters. It was 
a progressive message that 
most Disney stories haven’t 
yet embraced compared to the 
typical prince/princess story 
lines.

Out 
of 
excitement 
for 

“Frozen,” 
moments 
before 

the show began, I had a minor 
panic attack, a reaction friends 
who I brought for moral support 
successfully made fun of. Wait, 
will it be the actors’ voices? Or 
the ice skaters’ voices? Will it 
be the skaters singing? I do not 
give a shit about their voices. 
GIVE ME IDINA MENZEL 
AND KRISTEN BELL OR GIVE 
ME DEATH. After a vocally 
questionable intro with Sven 
and Kristoff, it was clear they 
kept near identical voices to the 
movie and the exact soundtrack 
recording 
for 
the 
musical 

numbers. Phew.

Furthermore (and I guess 

more 
importantly 
than 
my 

burning 
questions) 
the 
ice 

skating adaption stayed true 
to the film’s plot points, with 
minor cuts due to restrictions 
by the live production. Elsa and 
Anna’s parents were not present 
in the performance (But do we 
care? They were kind of dicks). 
Anna falls into a fruit stand 
instead of a boat when she first 
meets ultimate fuck-boy Prince 
Hans. But no worries, the really 
important stuff is still there. 
Olaf’s head comes off as many 
times as I could’ve asked for, Elsa 
whips off her cape in her fuck-
you-guys-I’m-awesome anthem 
“Let it Go,” and of course, there 
was 
an 
impressively 
large, 

inflated snow monster, which 
successfully scared the shit out of 
the young children surrounding 
me.

The 
live 
production 
was 

impressive to say the least. It 
came with snow falling from the 
ceiling, sparks and the occasional 
flame. A contraption on the 
ceiling worked in tandem with 

a staircase on the floor to give a 
buyable version of Elsa’s HGTV-
dream ice castle.

The biggest disappointment 

of the show was definitely when 
several green balls (presumably 
trolls) rolled across the ice into 
a woodlands set. We waited 
and waited for people on skates 
to burst out of their balls into 
full-on troll-hood, but to no 
avail. Soon after Anna and 
Kristoff’s dialogue, the balls 
rolled away and skaters came 
onto the ice separately. A small, 
yet 
extremely 
disappointing 

moment.

Sans 
some 
ball-enclosed 

Trolls, “Frozen on Ice” was 
everything I expected it could 
be. I got to sing “Let it Go” 
alongside an arena full of 
tiny humans, and believe it or 
not still got a little choked up 
when Anna saved Elsa. The ice-
skating added another aspect 
to the “Frozen” story, and the 
actors skated flawlessly around 
the arena floor for two hours 
slowing 
through 
dialogue 

and catchy musical numbers. 
Leaving Ann Arbor for the 
day and missing that party at 
Tower Plaza that was all over 
Yik Yak was totally worth it. 
“Frozen on Ice” was totally 
worth it.

‘Returned’ mimics 
French predecessor

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

A bus full of high schoolers 

careens off a mountain side. 
Four years later, a girl named 
Camille Winship (India Enne-
ga, 
“Treme”) 

climbs 
up 

from the same 
spot 
the 
bus 

fell. She walks 
home through 
her 
town 
of 

Caldwell, 
Washington. 
She gets home, 
where 
her 

mother Claire 
(Tandi Wright, 
“Jack the Giant 
Slayer”), 
hav-

ing just lit candles at a shrine for 
her daughter, stares at Camille. 
While Claire stands silently 
shocked but happy, Camille 
remains oblivious, not know-
ing she’s been dead for four 
years and hasn’t aged a day.

Based on the Internation-

al 
Emmy-winning 
French 

drama “Les Revenants,” “The 
Returned” 
is 
a 
perplexing 

remake developed by the pro-
lific Carlton Cuse who also 
produces A&E’s “Bates Motel,” 
a show which “The Returned” 
complements nicely consider-
ing both of their dark natures. 
At least for its first episode, 
“The Returned” remains large-
ly, sometimes overly, faithful 
to its French counterpart and 
effectively captures a sense of 
psychological complexity and 
unease within its small town 
setting.

Just like the idea of people 

returning from the dead, “The 
Returned” is a difficult show 
to initially wrap one’s head 
around. The show challenges 
viewers to think of the conse-

quences that a person returning 
from the dead might yield. None 
of the answers are exactly easy 
to grapple with. 

By 
primarily 
maintaining 

focus on the Winship family in 
its first episode, the show gauges 
the effects that a loss can have on 
a family and how this supernatu-
ral interference can further open 
these wounds. The home Camille 
returns to is drastically different 
than the one she left four years 
ago. Her parents are divorced, as 
her father Jack (Mark Pellegrino, 
“Lost”), is particularly embit-
tered, angrily attending group 
grief counseling sessions led by 
Peter Lattimore (Jeremy Sisto, 
“Suburgatory”) – who is now see-
ing Claire. Meanwhile, her iden-
tical twin Lena (Sophie Lowe, 
“Once Upon a Time in Wonder-
land”) has aged four years and 
deals with her problems by par-
tying at the local bar.

The family’s reactions to 

Camille’s return run the gaunt-
let of emotion. Claire’s initial 
happiness contrasts with the 
almost horror experienced by 
Lena. While Jack emotionally 
questions, “What kind of accep-
tance am I supposed to have 
now?” when talking to his wife 
and Peter, he reflects the inher-
ent sadness of what Camille will 
have to face, saying, “She has 
absolutely no idea what she’s 
returned to.” The performance 

of Pellegrino is the strongest 
from any actor in this impres-
sively acted premiere. Jack is a 
troubled man who now has to 
wrestle with the guilt of seeing 
his daughter return to a broken 
home.

Camille is not the only 

deceased to return though. 
There’s Simon Moran (Mat 
Vairo, “Revolution”) who wan-
ders the town trying to find his 
bride-to-be Rowan (Mary Eliz-
abeth Winstead, “Scott Pilgrim 
vs. the World”). And there’s the 
mysterious silent boy known 
only as Victor (Dylan Kin-
gwell, “Big Eyes”), among sev-
eral other plotlines introduced. 
There is an unease in the pre-
miere regarding these returns. 
The night of the returns cov-
ers the town in shadows and 
characters attempt to navigate 
the unknown territory they are 
experiencing. The efficient use 
of the Dutch angle in cinema-
tography makes several interac-
tions with the title “Returned” 
feel effectively off, as though 
reality were rejecting the very 
concept that has been made 
real. The use of these tech-
niques displays an influence 
of horror in the series which 
is further reinforced by turns 
“The Returned” makes near the 
end of its premiere.

The 
success 
of 
“The 

Returned” lies in it being able 
to distinguish itself from its 
acclaimed predecessor. In the 
coming episodes, the show will 
need to take opportunities to 
diverge, tinker or subvert what 
came before instead of strictly 
following the blueprint of “Les 
Revenants.” The pieces are 
there for a strong debut season, 
but it’s up to Carlton Cuse and 
his writers to effectively adapt 
the source material beyond a 
simple copy.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW
‘Rainbow Curse’ is 
lazy game-making

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

“Kirby and the Rainbow Curse” 

looks absolutely amazing. Its 
unique blend of Claymation and 
CGI gives the 
game a fabu-
lous, 
colorful 

look that’s much 
more 
consis-

tently 
appeal-

ing than other 
games like “The 
Neverhood” and 
“Clay 
Fighter” 

that attempted 
video 
game 

Claymation 
back in the ’90s.

Unfortunate-

ly, it’s also total-
ly boring. Its unique look just isn’t 
enough to make up for its lacklus-
ter level design and heavily flawed 
cooperative gameplay.

“Kirby and the Rainbow Curse” 

is a 2-D platformer controlled 

exclusively using the Wii U Game-
pad’s touch screen. Kirby (whose 
limbs have been compacted in 
what we can only assume was a 
truly horrific accident) takes the 
form of a sphere, which the player 
controls using rainbow pathways 
he or she draws with the stylus. It’s 
the same system used in the early 
DS game “Kirby: Canvas Curse,” 
only it’s way less interesting here. 
Kirby can’t copy the abilities of 
his enemies, and the gameplay 
of “Rainbow Curse” feels empty 
without this staple ability that 
has consistently been the most 
interesting part of “Kirby” games 
throughout the series’ long history.

Perhaps I have been spoiled by 

Nintendo’s other recently released 
platformers, like “Donkey Kong 
Country: Tropical Freeze” and 
“Super Mario 3D World.” These 
games are highly regarded for 
introducing a new gameplay con-
cept into every single level, always 
shaking things up enough to 
keep its solid base of platforming 

mechanics interesting through-
out. “Rainbow Curse” fails to 
reach this high bar. By the second 
world, I was tired of controlling 
Kirby with the stylus and the over-
ly simple mechanics introduced 
as I progressed had me clamor-
ing for complexity. I can remem-
ber most of the levels in “Super 
Mario Galaxy 2,” because of the 
new gameplay dimensions it intro-
duced in each of its dozens of lev-
els. I’d be hard-pressed to come up 
with more than a few innovative 
mechanics introduced in “Rain-
bow Curse.”

The game tries to shake up the 

typically bland level design with 
simple vehicle-based segments. 
Sadly, these levels fail to interest 
after their initial impact, and they 
quickly become just as boring as 
their more standard counterparts.

The game’s end-of-world bosses 

are initially moments of intrigue 
among the blandness, but only for 
the first three worlds. The bosses 
of worlds four through six are re-

skins of the first three bosses. It’s 
an 
inexcusable 
corner-cutting 

measure, proving that this game 
likely would have been better if it 
had more development time.

The game offers cooperative 

play for up to four players, but this 
cooperative experience is heavily 
flawed. No matter what, the first 
player dictates the boundaries of 
the screen as Kirby (the other play-
ers follow along with Wii remotes 
as secondary “Waddle Dee” char-
acters). While I played through 
World One with two other players, 
the newcomers were consistently 

warped to my location after lag-
ging behind or running ahead of 
me. Besides being able to attack 
foes, they had no agency over the 
level’s progression and quickly 
became frustrated. The co-op in 
“Rainbow Curse” typically boils 
down to “run around pointlessly 
while player one actually accom-
plishes things,” completely defeat-
ing the purpose of multiplayer.

To 
make 
matters 
worse, 

playing in co-op mode adds a 
tedious mini-boss fight into each 
level, in which the non-Kirby 
players must defeat an enemy that 

grabs and restrains Player One. 
It feels like a lame concession 
to the co-op players, with the 
designers acknowledging the 
lack of substantive multiplayer 
gameplay.

If you’re looking for a great 

Wii U platformer, leave “Rain-
bow Curse” in the dust and head 
straight for “Donkey Kong Coun-
try: Tropical Freeze,” a game 
with infinitely better level design 
and a whole lot more heart.

Vic Mensa shows 
talent in Chicago

Kanye cosign has 
potential, needs to 

drop live band

By YARDAIN AMRON

Daily Arts Writer

I bussed to Chicago this past 

weekend to visit a high school 
friend at Northwestern Univer-
sity and to escape the Ann Arbor 
bubble for a second. We went to 
a Vic Mensa show in the city Fri-
day night, at some spotless meat 
shop with an indoor-venue in the 
back — stage, lights, visuals, sec-
ond floor gallery; a lot of buttons, 
heels and man buns. Lux under-
ground, you could call it. 

I had not heard of Vic Mensa, 

but I learned about his recent 
successes, coming off a feature 
on Kanye’s recent drop “Wolves” 
and a European tour that just 
returned from London and Paris. 
“That was all cool, but it’s about 
Chicago,” Mensa said to an eager 
crowd. It’s unclear how much of 
this is due to the “Kanye Effect” 
(hanging out with Kanye and 
earning his respect brings fame).

There was a good-sized mosh 

already formed when we arrived 
– maybe 300 heads. We found 
some space towards the front 
right, by the un-dancy VIP sec-
tion with its table of unopened 
waters. I liked feeling like a 
plebeian. A part of me wanted 
to mosh and completely let go 
for a night, but I was worried 
my friend wasn’t as keen, so we 
danced hard and sober among 
stiff people, even though I usu-
ally say I only can dance when 
I’m drunk.

Mensa is a natural performer, 

which also helped, and held the 
crowd’s attention well. I chanted 
“Save Money” and “Los Angeles” 
when he told me to. I jumped up 
and down when he told me to. 
I turned my phone into a faux-
lighter when he told me to. He did 
at one point ask the soundboard 
guy to “turn it up” because “I 
gotta keep these people moving,” 

but I still saw a talented kid my 
age with a few catchy songs, lyri-
cal chops and serious potential. 
He mixes vocal melodies around 
his raps and makes you want to 
dance. There’s a lot to compare 
with Chance the Rapper, which 
makes sense considering the 
two plus a few other dudes make 
up a Chicago crew called “Save 
Money.” Think the next Odd 
Future.

Looking at Mensa, I saw in 

him the moment I dreamed about 
when I was younger – traveling 
the world with a band and fame 
and all that. Sure I’m a bit envi-
ous, but of Mensa, not his band. If 
he wants to be a Chance-caliber 
superstar, he needs to either get 
some actual talent supporting 
him — not a drummer that can’t 
even follow a backing track with 
an electronic kit, and not a gui-
tarist named Juicy Jack whose 
pick was more often in his mouth 
than his fingers — or, he needs 
to embrace what it means to be a 
solo artist. 

Take the low point of the show 

for example: Juicy Jack mistimed 
a sound cue at the climax of a new 
track, and while Mensa tried to 
save the moment by improving 
a vocal line, Juicy Jack took his 

white tee in his teeth and shook 
his head offstage at some friends 
in the VIP section. Big-time per-
formers sell their mistakes. 

But I believe it’s kind of silly 

there’s anyone onstage besides 
Mensa. The guitar and drums 
were more visual placeholders 
than anything, since he uses a 
pretty loud backing track. And 
the audience didn’t come to see 
anyone but Mensa in the first 
place. Why play the music any 
differently than how you made it? 
And if you think a band is crucial 
for a live performance, at least get 
a good one.

Mensa can write solid verses 

and has a knack for squeezing 
syllables into small phrases. He 
can produce a catchy dance tune 
and performs like he knows he 
has it. But his lyrics aren’t on an 
Earl Sweatshirt or J.Cole level, 
and he doesn’t have the vocal 
chops of a Frank Ocean or Child-
ish Gambino. At least not yet.

When the show ended and 

the mosh-pit unpacked, there 
were a bunch of shirtless boys, 
dazed and smiling, dripping 
sweat. Mensa’s music clearly 
has power. I just hope the fame 
doesn’t get to him like it did for 
Mac Miller.

“Kanye told me to get Thai food.”

Romans don’t 
know winter

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Arts Writer

Today it was a warm 61 

degrees out. There I was walk-
ing to class in my trench coat, 
my short sleeve shirt and my 
ballet flats — clearly loving life. 
Listening to the sensual sounds 
of Drake in one ear, coupled 
with the noises of the non-stop 
honking of smart cars in the 
other (real talk, I have never 
been more afraid of being hit by 
a smart car than here in Rome).

As I get closer to my school, 

I see more and more cool Ital-
ian students (they travel in 
packs, I need to be one of them) 
with their backpacks, perfectly 
coiffed hair and … parkas?

Maybe it’s the fact that I hail 

from Michigan — OK it most defi-
nitely is — but Europeans don’t 
have any idea of what it means to 
be “cold.” The first day it hit 50 
degrees here, some people on my 
program went to the beach. Now 
that may have been a stretch, but 
Romans seem to think there are 
only two seasons that exist, and 
they therefore dress accordingly 
— hot and cold, summer and win-
ter. Apparently, we are still in the 

thick of winter. Girls run around 
the streets of Rome with their fur 
hoods and their jackets zipped all 
the way up. Don’t get me wrong, 
underneath, they are dressed like 
Kim Kardashian post-Kanye (Her 
bleached hair is genius, don’t try to 
say otherwise). But here I am wor-
ried that sweater-weather is over 
and I didn’t bring enough spring 
clothes, and yet, I don’t know if 
the concept even exists here.

Regardless of the fact that there 

is clearly a seasonal identity crisis 
occurring, the “springtime” cloth-
ing people (especially students) 
wear here is impeccable — knit 
sweaters with skirts and tights, 
skinny black jeans paired with 
their LBBs; guys in their peacoats 
with their fingerless gloves, it’s all 
straight out of a street style blog.

All I can do at this point is copy 

and hope they think I’m one of 
them.

Tobias Jesso Jr.’s 
melancholic ‘Goon’

By CLAIRE WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

Well, somebody woke up on the 

wrong side of the bed this morn-
ing. Crotchety philosopher? Well-
dressed inmate? 
Mop-head teen? 
Not quite. The 
above 
photo 

displays 
the 

black-and-white 
headshot 
of 

pop star Tobias 
Jesso Jr., artist 
of the recently 
released 2015 album Goon.

If the untamed mound of hair 

and moderately attractive frown 
didn’t give it away, this chap obvi-
ously isn’t the happiest moose 
in the market. His debut album 
seems, unsurprisingly, to reflect 
the musician’s pining, lonely heart.

“Why can’t you just love me?” 

the rising star beckons us in a 
heartbroken first line. Sung with 
a sense of deflation more intense 
than a balloon in a vacuum, Jesso 
Jr.’s “Without You” is mopey, 
mushy and most likely your go-to 
during the Thursday morning 
thunderstorm. Throughout his 
12-track record, the singer-song-
writer certainly doesn’t win the 
variation award. “Without You” 
isn’t alone in its mellow melan-
choly — the vast majority of Goon 

sings of heartbreak and regret. 
Jesso Jr. confesses to making 
“you cry all those lonely tears” 
and bids “so long my only friend” 
above waw-waws of bluesy elec-
tric guitar and McCartney-esque 
piano. The titles don’t scream 
sunshine and daisies either: from 
“Can’t Stop Thinking About You” 
to “How Could You Babe,” it’s one 
lugubrious love after another. It’s 
the classic rainy day album: slow 
piano, light cymbals and 16 sad 
repetitions of “without you.”

Despite the excess sadness, 

the gentle piano, light percussion 
and unique vocals that define the 
album aren’t so bad. The album is, 
in fact, very pretty. Jesso Jr. boasts 
an original sound — the artist’s 
voice is intentionally flat, poignant 
in its lack of vibrato and dynam-
ics. Jesso Jr. asks, “won’t you come 
on home?” with gentle hesitation 
that translates into the beauti-
ful authenticity of “Bad Words.” 
The piano in “Can’t Stop Think-
ing About You,” notwithstanding 
its simplicity, is rather alluring 
and the unison voices of violin 
and vocals in “For You” give the 
song an acute sense of purity. The 
ringing instrumentals, slow drum, 
light cymbals — it all adds up to 
soft, mellow bittersweet.

The album’s content sports a 

sense of familiarity. Goon builds 
on an eclectic group of musicians 

and styles, cultured with the 
aspects of all sorts of artists. The 
Beach Boys’ “Sloop John B” pours 
through the arpeggiated guitar 
of Jesso Jr.’s fifth number “The 
Wait.” Chopin’s “Raindrop Pre-
lude” echoes in the closing sounds 
of “For You” and the groovy 
piano of Sara Bareilles shim-
mers in “Crocodile Tears.” Tones 
of John Lennon shine through 
“Without You” and traces of Paul 
Simon flicker in “Can We Still 
Be Friends.” And honestly, that’s 
part of the allure. Tobias Jesso Jr. 
appreciates, rather than shuns, 
the colors of past artists, giving 
his album a #throwbackThursday 
feel.

It’s this quality — comfort-

able familiarity yet distinct 
individuality — that makes 
Tobias Jesso Jr.’s album so 
appealing. It’s nothing ground-
breaking, but then again maybe 
“revolutionary” is over-rated. 
We’re not swept off our feet, 
and we don’t jump up and 
squeal, but Goon is a genuinely 
pretty album with pretty songs 
and we enjoy the listen.

So, despite my initial knee-

jerk reaction to the repetitive 
melancholy, 
it’s 
endearing. 

Innocent, almost naive piano, 
jazzy cymbals, pained vocals. 
There’s a certain beauty in its 
mellow simplicity, and I like it.

‘M’ places seventh 
at Wildcat Invite

By SAMANTHA MARSH

For the Daily

With 
underclassmen 

leading the way at the Wildcat 
Invitational in Arizona, the 
future looks bright for the 
Michigan women’s golf team.

Freshman Kathy Lim started 

off the tournament strong with 
an even-par 72 in the first round 
with birdies on holes five, six 
and 10. Closely behind were 
sophomore 
Grace 
Choi 

and freshman 
Megan 
Kim 

with 
74s, 

contributing 
to a team total 
of 296.

The second 

round of play was suspended 
until Tuesday morning due to 
darkness, and the Wolverines 
fought hard despite different 
weather conditions, shooting 
a 298. Michigan coach Jan 
Dowling said she was proud 
of the way her team handled 
themselves.

“The course that we played is 

desert golf so your ball can take 
a lot of unpredictable bounces 
that 
aren’t 
always 
great,” 

Dowling said. “They adjusted 
well and they were emotionally 
resilient throughout the whole 
week.”

The team finished the final 

round with a score of 300, 
contributing to a team total of 
894 for the tournament.

“Our final round wasn’t our 

best round,” Dowling said. “But 
they fought hard, and because 
of that we ended up nipping 
some teams and finishing in the 
top eight.”

Choi led the Wolverines and 

finished 16th overall after firing 

a pair of 73s during the second 
and third rounds and finishing 
with a total score of 220. It was 
a productive day for Choi, but 
one particular highlight stood 
out to her.

“On my 36th hole, I made 

a-25 footer in front of my 
teammates, so it was a pretty 
cool way to finish a long day of 
golf,” Choi said.

Her individual performance 

aside, Choi is optimistic about 

her 
team’s 

improvement.

“We 
are 

constantly 
putting 
ourselves 
up 

against 
the 

best teams in 
the 
nation, 

and that’s the only way to get 
better,” Choi said.

Among those teams was 

Southern 
California, 
which 

finished first with a combined 
score of 834, 60 strokes lower 
than Michigan.

Lim and freshman Emily 

White followed close behind 
Choi, shooting 225 and 227 
respectively. 
After 
playing 

as an individual in the last 
tournament, White was able to 
rejoin the lineup this week.

“She had a pretty solid 

tournament at the Hurricane 
Invitational,” 
Dowling 
said. 

“She deserved a shot at getting 
in the lineup.”

Three freshmen made up 

the team of five, and Dowling 
relied heavily on their talent 
throughout the tournament.

“Their potential is pretty 

vast,” Dowling said. “They’re 
a very hungry bunch. They are 
comfortable, they are really 
wanting to learn, and they are 
gaining a ton of experience.”

WOMEN’S GOLF
Wolverines kick off WNIT play

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is playing in 
the postseason, but it isn’t quite 
under the same circumstances it 
hoped to be in at this time of year.

After 

missing 
out 

on an NCAA 
Tournament 
bid, 
the 

Wolverines 
will kick off 
their Women’s 
National 
Invitational 
Tournament 
run Wednesday 
night 
when 

they take on 
Cleveland State 
(10-6 Horizon 
League, 
19-12 

overall) at Crisler Center.

“My staff met with each 

player individually (after the 
Big Ten Tournament), just to 
kind of refocus, regroup and talk 
about winning a championship,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico on WTKA Radio 
Tuesday morning. “Even if it is 
the WNIT championship, it’s 
something that hasn’t been done 
in Michigan women’s basketball 
(history).”

Michigan 
(8-10 
Big 
Ten, 

16-14 overall) is coming off 
a 
disappointing 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament in which in-state 
rival Michigan State handily 
defeated the Wolverines two 
weeks ago, 69-49.

In the game, Michigan was 

unable to get going offensively, 
shooting just 27.1 percent in its 
lowest-scoring output of the 
season.

“(The Spartans) were super 

fired up,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They came out really sharp, 
really crisp, shooting the ball 
especially well, so it was a tough 

game for us and a tough way to 
finish the season.”

If 
the 
Wolverines 
want 

to 
bounce 
back 
from 
their 

performance in Hoffman Estates, 
Illinois, senior forward Cyesha 
Goree is going to need to step up.

In her last two games, Goree 

has put up just two and five 
points, respectively, well below 
her season average of 13.8.

Michigan’s 3-point shooting 

arsenal of sophomore guard 
Siera Thompson, freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty and junior 
guard Madison Ristovski will 
also need to step up its game after 
shooting just a combined 11-for-
40 against the Spartans.

On 
the 
opposing 
side, 

Cleveland State comes into the 
game after being bounced from 
the Horizon League semifinals 
by Wright State, 99-87.

The 
Wolverines 
and 
the 

Vikings 
have 
played 
three 

common opponents this season: 
Minnesota, Detroit and Eastern 
Michigan. Cleveland State is 1-3 
in four contests against these 
opponents, splitting its season 
series with Detroit and dropping 

its 
games 
against 
Eastern 

Michigan and Minnesota.

Michigan, on the other hand, is 

3-1 against the three squads, with 
its only loss coming in double 
overtime to the Golden Gophers.

While the Vikings are 14-2 

at home, they are just 5-9 away 
from campus, which gives the 
Wolverines 
an 
advantage 
at 

home, where they are 12-4.

“They’re a team that has won 

19 games,” Barnes Arico said. 
“But we feel extremely fortunate 
that they are coming to Crisler, 
and we have an opportunity to 
play at home again.”

Cleveland State is led by 

first team All-Horizon League 
forward Imani Gordon, who 
leads the Vikings with 16.3 points 
per game, while second team 
All-Horizon League guard Cori 
Coleman averages 16.1 points.

“Cleveland State’s a team 

that has been really solid year 
in and year out,” Barnes Arico 
said. “They have three primary 
scorers, two kids who average 
over 16 points per game. They 
really shoot a ton of (3-pointers). 
They do a lot of dribble-drive, 

they get to the line a ton, so it is 
going to be a team that tests our 
defense and makes us get out and 
contest 3-point shots, as well as 
contain off the bounce.”

The Wolverines have shown 

this season that they can handle 
most teams that lack height, and 
the Vikings fit right into that 
formula with just one player 
taller than six feet.

But 
Michigan 
has 
also 

struggled down the stretch, 
having lost eight of its last 11 
games.

A win over Cleveland State 

could jumpstart a long run in the 
WNIT, as the Wolverines have 
just one opponent in their region 
with a higher RPI — Kansas 
State.

A win would also stretch out 

the illustrious Michigan careers 
of Goree, senior guard Shannon 
Smith and senior forward Nicole 
Elmblad just a little bit longer.

“I don’t think they’re ready 

to hang up their shoes just yet,” 
Barnes Arico said. “They want 
to put on that Michigan uniform 
again, so it’s really an exciting 
time for them.”

Michigan looks to keep up 
streak over Bowling Green

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan softball team 

hasn’t lost to Bowling Green 
since 2003, winning the last 
nine matchups 
between 
the 

teams.

But 
that 

doesn’t 
mean 

that anything 
is guaranteed 
Wednesday, 
when 
the 

Wolverines 
will host the 
Falcons 
at 

Alumni 
Field 

in their final 
game 
before 

Big Ten play 
begins Friday 
in Columbus.

Michigan (24-4) is looking 

to cap off its non-conference 
schedule with a win against 
Bowling Green by applying 
lessons learned from a gut-
checking loss to Kent State in the 
first game of its home-opening 
series last weekend.

“We’ll just focus on being able 

to make adjustments quicker,” 
said sophomore left fielder Kelly 
Christner. “Obviously in the first 
game (Saturday), we couldn’t 
make the adjustment of laying 
off the high pitch. Even in the 
game (Sunday), we couldn’t do 
that until the end of the game. So 
(we’ll focus on) trying to adjust 
pitch to pitch or at-bat to at-bat, 
instead of game to game.”

The Falcons (7-12) will enter 

Wednesday’s one-game contest 
riding the momentum of back-
to-back wins, but they will need 
to improve at the plate to upset 
the Wolverines.

Bowling Green sophomore 

Aspen Searle stands to be the 
biggest threat in the batter’s 
box, having contributed four 
home runs and a .426 on-base 
percentage in 19 games played 
this season. But other than 
Searle, the Falcons have just 
three players with a batting 
average greater than .300 — 

Michigan has six. And they will 
be facing a Wolverine pitching 
corps that has been excelling in 
the circle.

Sophomore 
right-hander 

Megan Betsa and senior left-
hander 
Haylie 
Wagner 
are 

coming into the game having 
allowed a combined five runs in 
three games against Kent State.

There is one chink in the 

Wolverines’ armor that may be 
exploited, however. Michigan 
senior catcher Lauren Sweet 
suffered an injury in a play 
at home plate on Saturday. 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
indicated that Sweet might need 
significant recovery time, but 
the diagnosis is not yet clear.

Sweet will likely be replaced 

by freshman Aidan Falk on 
Wednesday. 
Though 
Falk 

put 
together 
a 
respectable 

performance behind the plate 
Saturday, Michigan will miss 
the experience and leadership 
Sweet has accumulated in her 
three years at the position.

Losing Sweet’s bat will be 

a hard pill to swallow as well, 
given that she has tallied six 
home runs and 27 RBI so far this 
year while posting a .329 batting 
average.

Despite the setback, Hutchins 

emphasized that it won’t serve as 
a distraction, and that the team 
will still do what is necessary to 
win.

“I want to see us continue 

(taking it) one pitch at a time,” 
Hutchins said. “Winning the 
(Kent State) series was big, and 
hopefully that can give us some 
confidence. To get where we 
want to go, we have to be able to 
chip away and win tight games.”

Bowling Green right-hander 

Braiden Dillow will be the 
biggest threat in the circle, 
battling against a powerful 
Wolverines lineup that has hit 
48 home runs this season.

Dillow has a 3.79 earned 

run average through 16 games, 
and the other members of the 
Falcons’ pitching staff — right-
handers Jamie Kertes and Briana 
Combs — have accumulated 4.59 
and 4.74 earned-run averages, 
respectively.

Bowling Green will be in 

pursuit of its first win over 
Michigan in 12 years when 
it arrives in Ann Arbor, but 
Michigan won’t soon forget the 
upset it suffered against Kent 
State four days ago.

Goaltending solution a key
before Big Ten Tournament

By ERIN LENNON 

Daily Sports Editor

Though 
this 
year’s 
Big 

Ten field looks far different 
than it did in the conference’s 
inaugural season of hockey 
competition, one thing has 
stayed 
the 

same: 
strong 

goaltending.

Michigan State goaltender 

Jake Hildebrand stole the show 
in the regular-season finale 
against Michigan to secure 
his title as both the Big Ten 
Goaltender and Player of the 
Year. In doing so, the junior 
became the second straight 
netminder to earn both honors 
after Minnesota’s Adam Wilcox 
did last year.

If the Wolverines can get 

past 
Wisconsin’s 
standout 

goaltender 
in 
senior 
Joel 

Rumple — who led the Badgers 
to a Big Ten Championship and 
an at-large bid to the NCAA 
Tournament last season — they 
will face Hildebrand for the 
sixth time this season in the Big 
Ten semifinals Friday.

Of course, Michigan will have 

to overcome its own goaltending 
woes if it hopes to advance past 
Thursday’s first-round contest.

Having played 52 percent of 

the 
Wolverines’ 
goaltending 

minutes, junior Steve Racine 
carries the league’s worst save 
percentage (.892) among Big Ten 
netminders who have logged 
significant time. And though his 
counterpart, Zach Nagelvoort, 
is currently the conference’s 
second-best 
netminder 
on 

paper, the sophomore hasn’t 
been 
consistent 
enough 
to 

prevent Michigan from falling 
off the NCAA Tournament 

bubble.

In two starts last weekend, 

Nagelvoort 
allowed 
five 

goals. Saturday, he gave the 
Wolverines one of his best 
performances but was bested 
by 
Hildebrand 
in 
the 
2-1 

goaltending battle. He wasn’t 
stellar, but he kept Michigan in 
the game — something coach 
Red Berenson has been looking 
for in a starter all season.

But 
against 
proven 

postseason 
goaltenders 
in 

Rumple 
and 
Hildebrand, 

the 
Wolverines 
will 
need 

to be stellar if they want a 
championship of their own.

“I’m 
a 
one-goalie 
coach, 

but we’ve got two goalies,” 
Berenson said.

WOLVERINES 
DRAW 

WISCO: As the No. 3 seed for the 
second straight year, Michigan 
will play the conference’s last-
place finisher. This year, the 
Big Ten bottom feeder was 
Wisconsin by a landslide.

On paper, the quarterfinal 

matchup — which will take 
place Thursday night at Joe 
Louis Arena in Detroit — 
should mean an easy ‘W’ for the 
Wolverines. Michigan swept 
the Badgers in four games this 
season. And Wisconsin won 
just two conference matchups, 
compiling 
a 
4-25-5 
overall 

record and marking one of 
the worst seasons in program 
history.

Then again, that’s what was 

said about Penn State one year 
ago.

In their second year as a 

varsity program, the Nittany 
Lions entered the tournament 
having 
dropped 
16 
of 
20 

conference games — despite 
picking up two wins against 

Michigan — before playing 
spoiler in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Like 
Wisconsin, 
Penn 

State had skated with teams 
like Minnesota all season, as 
the Nittany Lions had eight 
conference games decided by 
one goal. They, too, were a young 
team improving by the day.

Two 20-minute overtimes 

later, Michigan walked off the 
ice having been stunned, its 
postseason plans erased.

So with nothing in terms of 

reputation or “status” to lose 
and a surprise Big Ten automatic 
bid to gain, the Badgers are as 
dangerous as anyone heading 
into the first round of the 
conference tournament.

“The last two games they 

played 
here, 
they 
were 
a 

different 
team,” 
Berenson 

said. “I think they got a little 
confidence here even though 
they lost.”

COMPHER 
COMING 

BACK?: Forward JT Compher 
is listed as day-to-day, Berenson 
said Monday. The sophomore 
left the game in the second 
period after taking a hard hit 
into the boards in East Lansing 
on Friday.

He did not return in the third 

period and missed Saturday’s 
season finale at Yost Ice Arena.

Compher has held one of 

Michigan’s hottest sticks down 
the stretch, having notched 
two hat tricks in his last five 
games. After a quiet first half, 
Compher — last year’s Big Ten 
Freshman of the Year — scored 
seven goals in four games to tie 
his career record for goals in a 
season (11).

The final decision on his 

return will be made Wednesday 
after practice, Berenson said.

NOTEBOOK

Baxter building special 
teams from ground up

The coordinator 

is focusing on 

teaching the basics 

this spring

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan football team 

didn’t make a single field goal 
in 
practice 

Tuesday. 
But 
for 

special 
teams 

coordinator 
John 
Baxter, 

things 
are 

going just as 
planned.

A 
year 

removed from 
his last stint 
at 
Southern 

California, Baxter is building 
his special teams unit from the 
ground up. After losing punter 
Will Hagerup and kicker Matt 
Wile to graduation, Baxter has 
his hands full tweaking the 
replacement candidates.

“What we’re doing is what 

pro baseball players call ‘the 
bullpen,’ ” he said. “They’re 
just spinning balls into the net, 
they work the mechanics from 
the ground up, and that’s what 
we’re doing here. I’m taking 
these guys, and they’re kicking 
way less than they probably ever 
have, and we’re rebuilding them 
from the ground up.

“Once the season gets going, 

it’s going to get hot out there, 
its going to get dicey, and if you 
can’t bring a kid back to some 
place he’s familiar with, he’s 
going to spend the fall lost.”

Anticipated starter Andrew 

David doesn’t arrive on campus 
for a few months, but in the 

meantime, Baxter is treating 
all of his players like starters. 
Sophomore 
Kyle 
Seychel, 

freshman Ryan Tice and senior 
Kenny Allen are all getting 
equal reps — albeit into the net.

In addition to the kicking 

game, 
Baxter 
tried 
out 
14 

Wolverines in the kick return 
position Tuesday.

“My job at this point is not 

to pick a starter, name a starter, 

or 
even 

think 
about 

a 
starter,” 

Baxter 
said. 

“My 
job 
is 

to 
build 
as 

much 
depth 

as 
possible. 

I’m just trying 
to build a GM 
car, 
where 

you can take 
a 
carburetor 

on an Olds, put it on a Buick 
and keep going — build as much 
depth as possible.

“Someone will be standing 

out there at the stadium in Utah, 
but I’m not sure who it’ll be.”

Regardless of who it is, there’s 

a good chance Baxter will know 
him well. The only coach who 
didn’t go on any of the team’s 
flurry of recruiting trips, Baxter 
stayed in Ann Arbor to help 
implement his trademarked and 
nationally utilized “Academic 
Gameplan” 
program, 
which 

focuses on strategizing academic 
success.

With many players taking 

extra credits to create wiggle 
room in the fall, Baxter knows 
that building a program from the 
ground up requires persistent 
support both on and off the field.

“(In the past,) we were 

drinking out of a garden hose. 
Today they’re drinking out of 
a fire hydrant,” Baxter said of 

academics today. “So we need 
to help them sort through that 
chaos. It’s one thing to say we 
have student-athletes — it’s 
another thing to live it.”

On 
the 
field, 
Baxter’s 

grassroots 
special 
teams 

campaign involves a lot of 
strategizing, but not a lot of 
results. Not yet, at least.

“Imagine being a swing coach 

in golf,” Baxter said. “If you’re 
going to break a guy’s swing 
down and make changes, you 
can’t expect him to be hitting 
great drives down the middle 
right away. There’s going to be 
some glitches.

“But it’s March. I’m not 

really worried about March, I’m 
worried about September. So if 
we don’t take this time to make 
fundamental changes — their 
mobility, their core, all that kind 
of stuff — then we’ll never have a 
chance to change them.”

For a team that made just 

71.4 percent of its field goals and 
ranked 127th out of 128 teams 
in return yardage last season, 
Baxter knows the ‘swing’ won’t 
come right away. But with plenty 
of depth in all units returning 
to campus, he feels that the 
talent is there, it just needs to be 
discovered.

“If you’re going to work on 

their swing, you’ve got to take 
the results away, because they’ll 
worry about the results,” Baxter 
said. “I’m not worried about 
the results. I’m worried about 
getting that swing right. The 
results will be there.

“There are guys out there 

right now that you’ll say they’ll 
never see the field that will be on 
the field. There’s a guy that you 
don’t even know his name that’s 
going to make the play of the 
season, and I don’t know who it 
is either.”

“So we need to 
help them sort 
through that 

chaos.”

L

ast St. Patrick’s Day, I 
remember 
leaving 
the 

house with one of my room-

mates on a people-watching expe-
dition. Before either of us partook 
in any of the celebrations, we 
wanted to take the time to take 
full witness of the carnage that 
was ensuing just south of campus.

If you’ve ever been in Ann 

Arbor on a football Saturday, you 
can probably picture the scene: 
kegs, mud, orange construction 
fences, mud, bro tanks, funnels, 
mud, and music. The difference 
was the substitution of green for 
the customary maize and blue.

As 
we 
walked 
passed 
an 

unnamed fraternity house on 
our way home for the afternoon, 
I noticed a group of middle-aged 
men and women standing on the 
sidewalk observing the destruc-
tion. They were all Ann Arbor 
residents and, despite the occa-
sional shamrock pin, they were 
not there to celebrate. They were 
there to protect the students.

As partygoers exited the fra-

ternity’s backyard, I watched as 
these adults stopped particu-
larly intoxicated boys and girls 
to check their condition, asked if 
they needed transportation, and 
— in the most severe cases — con-
tacted the proper authorities to 
get students the help they needed.

I 
remember 
immediately 

feeling embarrassed as a group 
of partygoers, obviously more 
concerned 
about 
preserving 

the health of the party than the 
health of their peers, gathered 
on the porch and heckled these 
Good Samaritans as they relayed 
information to paramedics and 
police.

Though visibly disturbed, the 

vigilant group of Ann Arborites 
did not waver from their spot. 
They held their ground as two 
paramedics and a police officer 
entered the yard to retrieve a 
young girl who appeared uncon-
scious. Only as the party began 
to dwindle down — presumably a 
shortage of green beer — did they 
move down the block to the next 
party.

I don’t know any of the people 

that were in that group of citizens. 
They don’t know me. But, that 

day, they were out there to make 
sure our student body was safe. 
At worst, they shut down a couple 
parties. At best, they may have 
protected someone from serious 
injury or death.

This 
school 
is 
a 
world-

renowned institution and natu-
rally elicits a sense of prestige 
— and a fair share of perks — to 
those fortunate enough to have 
the chance to enroll. But, like 
other universities across the coun-
try, it places students in an envi-
ronment that breeds a sense of 
entitlement while simultaneously 
clouding students’ perceptions of 
the “real world” outside this two-
mile bubble.

That entitlement includes a 

belief that someone else will step 
in to protect us when we do stupid 
things. While this becomes the 
case in practice, it should not be 

the expectation. The old motto, 
“college is the place for making 
mistakes,” is not a free pass to 
make your safety — potentially 
your life — someone else’s respon-
sibility.

I didn’t end up drinking last St. 

Patrick’s Day. Witnessing so many 
“close calls” killed my desire to 
celebrate Christianity coming to 
Ireland and PBR coming to Hill 
Street. This year, I’ll likely cel-
ebrate with a non-green beer as I 
edit installments for next week’s 
magazine.

But if the group of unappre-

ciated guardians decides to do 
their holiday service once more, I 
hope they are at least treated with 
respect — maybe even offered a 
passing “thank you” for keeping 
watch over crazy crowds of kids 
decked in green.

Becoming a Townie: How to read in Ann Arbor

A

nn Arborites know how to 
read, but for newbies to the 
city, perfecting this takes 

some time.

Moving to a new city is like get-

ting a new credit card — you’ve got 
to think about every area of your 
life in which this personal infor-
mation is recorded and update it. 
You don’t realize the full impact 
until Netflix is randomly can-
celed in the middle of your House 
of Cards episode, until you end 
up spending unnecessary time 
changing your Amazon informa-
tion, until you can’t Venmo a friend 
on a Friday or until your new com-
pany cancels the card when they 
see an “unusual charge” in another 
state that your old company knew 
you visited every month.

Moving 
means 
unexpected 

changes, unforeseen costs and 
unnecessarily spent time trying 
to figure it out. Once you’re done 
changing your mailing address, 
finding a new doctor in the area 
and whatever else comes up, 
you’re eventually going to have to 
find your reading nook — everyone 
must have a good reading nook!

Luckily for us, Ann Arbor’s full 

of them, and the day will 
come as you are settling 
in to your new community 
that, if you’re anything like 
me, you’ll want to get away 
from it all in exchange for 
your fictional world, but 
this isn’t so easy.

With a roommate and 

a rowdy hall, I remem-
ber moving to Ann Arbor 
and reading in the UGLi, 
which is completely laugh-
able now. Sure, I knew how 
to read, but in this city, I 
didn’t really know how to 
read. Immersive reading is 
all about letting your novel 
consume you, but trying to 
immersive yourself in the 
wrong location can inter-
rupt your thought process, 
detract from your reading 
experience and just gen-
erally violate the author’s 
intention for how their 
work was to be read.

To read immersively, I 

highly suggest you get the 
heck off campus, espe-
cially if it’s a Saturday in 
the fall.

It wasn’t until I spent my first 

summer here that I realized just 
how vast the reading culture 
extends, and all of the prime read-
ing real estate I had been ignor-
ing. If you go far enough north of 
central campus, before actually 
making it to what I consider north 
campus, you will find two parks 
adjacent to one another that I have 
now discovered are called Broad-
way and Riverside parks, respec-
tively.

These are really just a couple 

patches of open space and a few 
trees, but they are settled on either 
side of the Huron River, making 
for an ideal summer spot. With-
out walking all the way to the Arb, 
having to deal with parking or the 
crowds that, at least for me, were 
a little distracting on summer 
weekends, you can sit nestled next 
to the river and trees with a good 
book for hours here.

When Ann Arbor started to get 

a little chilly — and then when Ann 
Arbor became utterly unbearable 
— going to Literati to peruse books 
and then taking them over to 
TeaHaus became a regular routine 
for me. I’ve also checked out the 

Dawn Treader, which I don’t think 
is great to read in, but it’s a pretty 
good, cheap Literati alternative. 
There’s also Kaleidoscope Books 
and Collectibles, if you’re into that 
sort of thing, which is conveniently 
next to my second favorite winter 
reading location, the Food Co-op 
in Kerrytown. (Although, as a fair 
warning, this place also gets a little 
too loud on weekends!)

Practicing these patterns of 

good reading is the only way I have 
ever been able to hold myself to 
reading all of the lovely, perspec-
tive-shaking, 
thought-inducing 

novels I’ve read during my time 
at college. Spending my free time 
engulfed in the thoughts of Maya 
Angelou, Arthur Golden, Albert 
Camus, and George Eliot has a 
way of providing clarity to every-
thing else, but being distracted by 
phones, roommates, and perpetu-
al chatter has a way of ruining the 
experience. Go out into the world 
and find yourself a nook: it’ll do 
you and your mind some good, and 
you can explore the weird little 
corners Ann Arbor hides at the 
same time.

Rethinking Ross

The unglamorous realities of a business school education

K

endall Cortez was immediately sold on 
what he was getting into. 

The sophomore was just getting set-

tled in at orientation as a new member of the 
Ross School of Business, and was being intro-
duced to his orientation group’s assignment. 
The idea was to use a competition to bring the 
section together while introducing principles 
of business to the newly admitted students. The 
goal: create a Kickstarter for a business that 
wanted to supply computers to underprivileged 
youth in Detroit.

Cortez, who grew up in a lower-income 

Detroit family, applied to the Business School 
for social change and effective community 
action just like this. He was a business student 
for less than a day, and he was already living his 
dream.

But almost as quickly as he was sold on the 

project, he realized that the dream was going 
to have to wait. There were roughly 85 other 
students in his group, and he got a taste of what 
happens when that many high-minded and 
motivated individuals are asked to collaborate 
and compete.

“As we start working and separating our-

selves into teams, you can see the alpha dog-
ness in a lot of people,” Cortez said. “I like to be 
around a pretty diverse group, people who are 
knowledgeable and socially conscious, so I’m 
used to kind of stepping back, give your idea, 
and come to some consensus. But a lot of people 
came in feeling like they had the idea, they had 
to take charge.

“Everybody is trying to take over and rule 

this room. That’s really not how to get things 
done, so I just immediately was sensing trouble. 
At first, I just tried to kind of bring the group 
together and even try to take a leadership role 
until I realized that no one was listening, every-
one has their own opinion, nobody is willing to 
listen to anybody else’s thoughts.”

Cortez could tell right away that it was trou-

ble. Just a few rooms over, fellow Business soph-
omore Emily Yerington was struggling through 
a very similar experience.

“I really didn’t know what to expect, so I was 

trying to be open-minded about it going in,” 
she said. “What ended up happening was that 
it became a shouting contest and it was actually 
very much male-dominated. That was the only 
experience I’ve ever had where I felt like I was 
at a disadvantage for being a girl.”

“The only people that were getting their voic-

es heard were these guys and most of them were 
bigger and almost scary.”

It’s no secret that the Ross School of Business 

is an elite institution. It regularly ranks among 
the top five undergraduate business schools in 
the world, and 92 percent of its students have a 
job offer within six months of graduation. Last 
year, 1,139 freshman — 19 percent of the Uni-
versity’s class of 2017 — applied to the Business 
School, a number that has continued to grow 
year after year. About 400 students were admit-
ted at the end of their freshman year — accom-
panying about 100 pre-admitted students — to 
make up the entering sophomore class.

But if the Business School is so popular and 

successful, why do students want to leave? Both 
Yerington and Cortez left the Business School 
after their first semester, and roughly 3 percent 
of students drop the program each semester.

Though the magnitude of the dissatisfaction 

will vary, stories of herd mentality, arrogance 
and a lack of a voice inside the Business School 
leave many dismayed and even upset with their 
collegiate path.

“There is a lot of ‘Oh my god, I hate this place. 

I’m just here because I know I’m going to get a 
job,’ “ Cortez said. “When I decided to drop, I 
heard a lot of ‘Kendall, that takes so much cour-
age, I wish I had dropped.’ There’s definitely a 
sense within the Business School that people 
who are in it love to hate it.”

Always at the forefront of academic pres-

tige and success, the school now finds itself at 
the forefront of a much less desirable position. 
The negative internal and external perceptions 
of the Business School are mounting, and the 
school must find a way to respond.

***

For whatever reason, many students love to 

hate the Business School.

Some people dislike the Business School 

for the building, already critiqued as overly 
extravagant with expansions on the way. Others 
dislike the seemingly endless supply of funds 
for students, artwork, and — of course — mov-
ing trees. Others still disapprove of the exclu-
sionary culture, one in which students try to 

separate themselves from the remainder of the 
student body, with exclusive classes, recruiting 
opportunities, and even a separate name.

For Lynn Wooten, the associate dean for 

undergraduate programs, however, it’s the 
internal dissatisfaction that’s most problematic. 
A longtime researcher in strategy, management, 
and organizational behavior, Wooten knows the 
dangers of these competition-filled communi-
ties.

“We try to reach out to every student and to 

practice what we preach with this notion of self-
authorship and finding your passion,” she said. 
“But no matter how much we say it, research 
says that students are going to follow their 
peers. You can come in wanting to use business 
for social change, but then you see everyone is 
doing finance. I’ve heard some students say they 
feel marginalized, and then they ultimately 
went into finance because they felt a big push to 
do so.”

In total, around 40 percent of the Business 

School students go into finance, making it far 
and away the most popular component of busi-
ness, though Wooten said there was similar peer 
pressure felt to go into accounting and consult-
ing as well.

Both Cortez and Yerington applied to the 

Business School with ambitions surrounding 
social change, but both felt that it wasn’t the 
peers that did the funneling into finance — it was 
the coursework structure. Beginning a business 
curriculum with quantitative and foreign con-
cepts of accounting and business analytics only 
furthered the bitter taste, Yerington said.

“I was never mainstream business, which is 

a vast majority of what Ross is.” Yerington said. 
“As much as they pretend that they aren’t about 
that, that’s exactly what they are. (The adminis-
trators and faculty) act as if they want to make 
us all individuals who are going to go out and 
change the world, but they make it so all of our 
resumes look exactly the same, our interviews 
are trained to be exactly the same way, and basi-
cally they just funnel you into paths and you’re 
going to be a little clone with everyone else.”

Added Cortez: “They need to do a better job 

of letting kids know that there’s more to busi-
ness than three fields … Yes, these are the most 
popular, but there’s a slew of other things that 
you can do and be happy doing with a business 
degree.”

This narrow focus goes with what Wooten 

describes as a herd mentality — a process of 
assimilation and conformity that the dean sees 
as the school’s greatest flaw. There are a number 

of factors that go into this practice, but Wooten 
believes the dynamic is already in place before 
the students enter the Business School.

With this year’s introduction of a more flexi-

ble curriculum that will, for the first time, allow 
students to study abroad during the academic 
year beginning next year, along with enhanced 
programs to ensure a thriving culture and posi-
tive influences, Wooten said she feels that the 
next two years will be a major step for the Busi-
ness School to increase student happiness.

However, admittance and core classes begin 

in sophomore year, which means most students 
may already be a part of communities on cam-
pus. This may narrow students’ focus both aca-
demically and socially, hindering the influence 
of added programs.

“The question becomes, how do we get peo-

ple to find where they can thrive and fit into the 
culture, and how do we change the perception 
of the culture to make everyone feel welcome?” 
Wooten said. “That involves trying to get people 
to know each other better through teamwork 
and group projects.

The focus on technical skills and quantitative 

specialization is a growing trend among most 
business schools, but, according to a 2012 report 
by The Wall Street Journal, employers don’t 
agree with this trend.

Employers need “flexible thinkers with 

innovative ideas and a broad knowledge base 
derived from exposure to multiple disciplines,” 
but don’t find it in the business world because 
“the undergraduate degrees focus too much on 
the nuts and bolts of finance and accounting 
and don’t develop enough critical thinking and 
problem-solving skills through long essays, in-
class debates and other hallmarks of liberal-arts 
courses,” the article read.

Around the same time that the report came 

out, Wooten and fellow Business School admin-
istrators were beginning to finalize plans to join 
a growing number of business programs with 
redesigned curriculums. The changes are only 
beginning to take place, but it was clear from the 
start what the goals were.

Through revised curriculum, supplemen-

tal programs and an enhanced support staff, 
Wooten and the rest of the administrators are 
looking toward customization and a sense of 
purpose for all 500 students in each grade level.

“What keeps me up at night is thinking about 

how I can make sure Ross is the best business 
school and transformational experience for 
everyone,” Wooten said. “If I think about the 
changes I want to make, I want to have engaged 

learning experiences inside and outside of the 
classroom.”

The new design increased the number of 

business classes — something Wooten said had 
to be done to keep up with other schools — but 
also increased flexibility. For the first time, 
business undergrads are able to study abroad 
and now have the opportunity to schedule core 
classes to their choosing.

But Wooten’s ultimate goal is to increase stu-

dent happiness while continuing the same prac-
tices that make the Business School one of the 
world’s premier business programs each year.

***

Cortez watched in dismay as his fellow stu-

dents took over the project at orientation. He 
didn’t mind taking a backseat, but couldn’t quite 
grasp just how misguided the self-appointed 
drivers were. With the task of providing com-
puters to Detroit youth, Cortez knew right away 
that this was a far cry from the environment of 
his roots.

“A lot of people weren’t sensitive to Detroi-

ters, Detroit kids,” Cortez said. “A lot of words 
or ideas that were problematic to me. ‘We have 
to save them, they’re not advanced enough,’ and 
as a native Detroiter, I’m just thinking ‘Really?’ 
There was just a lot of problematic stuff that I 
took issue with right away, and I could already 
tell that the environment was going to be dif-
ferent.”

There are plenty of opportunities for the 

Business School to grow, but perhaps none are 
as measurable as the lack in diversity in the 
program. In the most recent cohort of accepted 
students, just 4 percent of the Business School 
bachelor’s degree program identified as an 
underrepresented minority. More remarkable 
is that that number is actually an improvement 
from each of the last two years.

For Cortez, who is Black, this is far from 

ideal.

“There’s definitely some added pressure,” 

he said. “Especially when I was first thinking 
about leaving Ross. I remember thinking, am I 
letting everyone down by leaving? What mes-
sage does that send to everyone that helped get 
me there or might be trying to follow me? Is 
that a slap in the face?”

Katrina Vegter, the school’s academic advis-

ing director, and Business School adviser Mat-
thew Turner said this is a problem that goes 
beyond numbers and takes time and flexibility 
to solve.

“We look at and meet every student individu-

ally,” Turner said. “We don’t group students 
together, so no one’s a minority when they meet 
with us. So we meet with students and let them 
know, ‘No, this is where you should be, there’s a 
place for you to be here.’ ”

Added Vegter: “I’ve had female students 

come in and say that all the male members of 
their group expected her to be the secretary and 
take notes. So what are you going to say to them 
if that comes up again, what steps need to be 
taken? Because some of these problems aren’t 
going to leave once you get out in the workforce 
either. I think we play that role of helping stu-
dents effect change, but those are tough issues 

to overcome, as we’re seeing nationwide.”

Programs enforcing awareness and inclusiv-

ity are put into place each year, but Cortez feels 
that having a dominant majority is a problem 
that can’t necessarily be solved, only improved 
upon.

“I don’t know if there’s anything the school 

itself can do about that. How do you go about 
making sure that everybody (accepted to) Ross 
has the right motives? All you can do is read two 
(application) essays.”

***

Just as the Business School’s heavy emphasis 

on group projects makes a cohesive culture ben-
eficial for students, the school’s notorious curve 
can often turn students against each other.

With participation, homework, assignments, 

projects, and exams all held to a curve or set 
standard, students are constantly competing 
with one another, making buy-in on programs 
to develop cohesion a tough sell.

“There are a lot of resources there already 

that students might not really come to,” Veg-
ter said. “One of the challenges we face is teas-
ing out what the student’s needs and finding 
out what is going to be the right combination 
of clubs and programs and classes to get the 
results. But we find things to get drowned out 
by the competition of it all.”

Even though core business classes are 

curved to a B+ average, among the highest such 
curves at the University, Yerington felt that the 
lack of control over your own destiny can take 
a toll, especially when grades can vary wildly 
and not be made known until the very end of 
the semester.

“I feel like if a teacher is doing their job, it 

should be possible for everybody to succeed,” 
Yerington said. “Even though they curve it 
high, it’s just a bad mentality when you’re not 
worried about how much you’re learning, 
you’re worried about how you’re doing com-
pared to everyone else.”

Added Turner: “The curve is a blessing and a 

curse. In the quantitative classes, most students 
find it awesome, but in qualitative classes, the 
scores become very tight. But again, it’s one of 
those things that out in the world, it’s some-
thing as simple as a small typo that can be the 
difference in who gets the job, so they’re kind of 
life lessons.”

The real-world application is what Turner 

believes is the school’s greatest strength, but 
with students barely into adulthood with no 
idea of what they want to do for the rest of their 
life, is there a limit?

Cortez felt that there was. An explorative 

learner who’s now majoring in history and ecol-
ogy, Cortez felt the core classes — which include 
accounting and business analytics in the first 
semester — weren’t conducive to finding one’s 
passion in business. Cortez could tell it was a 
problem in the classes, where the majority of 
students appeared bored, confused or annoyed 
at the material.

When weighing the idea of dropping, how-

ever, Cortez suddenly found himself standing 
out with his beliefs.

“I remember when I was thinking about 

leaving, people came up to me and said ‘You are 
crazy. I don’t really like it either, but you have to 
stay. This is great, this is how you’re going to get 
a job.’ ” he said. “I’m thinking about how that’s 
great, but I’m not going to like myself.”

“If your motives aren’t right, like mine 

weren’t — I saw dollar signs when I saw Ross, 
not a real institution that can help me change 
things — it’s going to add up quickly,” he added.

Though Cortez and Yerington are among a 

small minority of students who leave the pro-
gram, the school’s staff notice. They also notice 
that, despite the favorable job and compensa-
tion prospects, business majors are regularly 
reported as among the least happy in school 
and the workplace nationwide. They notice the 
complaints from current students too, and con-
stantly look to keep up with the increasingly 
aware and strong-willed student voice.

“I think the student population is by its 

nature a group that’s really tough on us, con-
stantly asking the hard questions,” Vegter said. 
“Why are we doing things this way? Why are 
we doing this? Has it always been this way? Can 
we do something differently? Students push us 
to think critically and keep up and strive to cre-
ate new things and ideas.”

With the help of the Ross Undergraduate 

Student Advisory Board, a council of students 
who report feedback from students on curricu-
lum, programs and more, the Business School 
has undergone a series of changes, with more 
on the way.

The new curriculum, which was piloted by 

this year’s sophomores, includes a sophomore 
seminar, increased flexibility in what classes 
to take and when and supplemental programs 
to ensure a sense of purpose throughout their 
three years.

Next year’s incoming class can anticipate 

smaller class and orientation sizes, additional 
programs on diversity in the workplace, and an 
increased solicitation of feedback to ensure sat-
isfaction for years to come.

“We try to get students to think about busi-

ness as not a job, but as a profession, a societal 
entity that has the potential to make a positive 
difference,” Wooten said. “People are happy 
when they find jobs that play to their strengths 
and also like who they’re working for and what 
they’re doing.”

“Let’s create this roadmap, create this pas-

sion, let’s combine this business degree with 
other education and find a way to fulfill that 
passion in the short term and the long term 
and get them to see that potential that you have 
with that business degree.”

For whatever reason, 
many students love 
to hate the Business 

School.

“I saw dollar signs ... 
not a real institution 

that can help me 
change things.”

Women in Leadership Lessons 

fosters necessary conversations for young professionals

by Natalie Gadbois, Deputy Statement Editor

T

he statistics are well-worn but still concerning: 
women comprise only 4.6 percent of Fortune 500 
CEOs. Only 9 percent of the top 250 films released 

in 2012 were directed by women. The contentious pay gap 
— argued by many as an effect of environmental choices 
rather than institutionalized sexism — does exist, with 
women making only 77 cents for every dollar their male 
counterparts earn.

It can be a murky world out there for women, particu-

larly those with professional ambitions. However, there 
are resources for young women hoping to move forward 
in their careers. The Business School offers a longstand-
ing club called the Michigan Busi-
ness Women, and, in the past year, 
a chapter of Lean In — the national 
non-profit organization dedicated 
to promoting equality for women — 
was introduced at the University.

For women in the LSA Organi-

zational Studies program, Women 
in Leadership Lessons — otherwise 
known as WiLL —fosters the com-
plex conversations women need 
to have when considering their 
futures.

The 
Organizational 
Studies 

major, a competitive program com-
bining disciplines such as psychol-
ogy, sociology and economics, hosts 
a wide range of students, from those 
pursuing consulting and non-profit 
work to environmentalism, public 
health, and marketing. WiLL was 
founded seven years ago as an OS 
group by professors and students 
who saw a need to support women 
as they began to enter their various 
workforces.

Originally, the club was relatively 

unstructured, focusing on a few 
capstone events a year. Last year 
current LSA senior Jenna Fiore saw 
a new potential in the informal club, 
and she restructured it to build it into a support system 
with weekly meetings alongside the larger events.

“The group was really small and I wanted to revitalize 

it, so I registered it as a formal group on campus, wrote 
a constitution, got a faculty advisor from OS,” Fiore said.

The group is still small — around twenty-one official 

members — but this smaller atmosphere contributes to 
the intimate camaraderie and support found at the weekly 
meetings.

***

It’s 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday, and girls are shuffling in 

one by one to the Sophia B. Jones room at the Michigan 
Union. Quiet conversation ranges from Spring Break trips 
to upcoming group projects to advice on how to find sum-
mer housing. Fiore begins the meeting with an icebreaker: 
the usual highs and lows of the week and spring break 
highlights, plus one question unique to this organization: 
“Who is your female role model?”

As the ten or girls go around, their answers are varied 

— some say their mothers, others mention public leaders 
like Malala Yousafzai and Michelle Obama, others jok-

ingly cite fictional characters like Julia from “Parenthood” 
— but there is a collective warmth as the conversation 
develops around inspiring women. It’s small, supportive 
gestures like this that show WiLL’s value, something that 
incoming club president Grace Fisher, an LSA junior, was 
initially drawn to.

“We are able to share our experiences in terms of intern-

ships and give each other some recommendations, and 
help each other in a more professional capacity,” Fisher 
said. “But we also are able to have real conversations about 
women in the workforce.”

WiLL holds resume, salary negotiation, and LinkedIn 

workshops and hosts guest speakers addressing their 
paths as women in the workforce — all ways to educate 
members on how to navigate male-dominated spaces suc-
cessfully. However, each week the group also discusses 
the broader social implications for working women by 
reading feminist articles and watching TED talks from 
speakers like Sheryl Sandburg, Chief Operating Officer of 
Facebook and author of “Lean In.” It’s this combination of 
goals — both to assist women in a still unequal world and 
directly address the problematic structures women face 
— that club adviser Sara Soderstrom thinks makes WiLL 
so empowering.

“Some of (WiLL) has been focused on those individual 

skills that women can develop to navigate (the workforce), 
and other parts have been thinking more broadly,” said 
Soderstrom, an assistant professor in OS and Program in 
the Environment. “What are some of the types of changes 
that we would like to see? How can we see them through?”

This multifaceted approach allows the group to be 

positive and supportive while still recognizing the issues 
women face, an aspect that was really important to Fiore.

“It’s easy to see WiLL as ‘Oh, women have all these chal-

lenges in the workforce, you need to discuss how to over-
come them,’ but it’s not really just about that because it’s 
not straightforward like that,” she said. “There are other 
things, regardless of gender, issues that can come up and 
you want to be able to talk about them.”

WiLL is in many ways a focused contribution to the 

increasingly widespread public discussion about women 
in the workforce. Both Fiore and Fisher recognize that the 
environment women face today is vastly different than the 
one women a generation before encountered.

The popularity of movements like Lean In or actress 

Amy Poehler’s “Smart Girls at the 
Party” — an online women’s advo-
cacy forum — show that gender 
inequality is at the foreground of 
the zeitgeist now more than ever. 
Soderstrom reflects this, admitting 
that as an Engineering undergrad-
uate she didn’t fully understand 
the idea of gender inequality and 
misrepresentation.

“I was naïve to a lot of it,” Sod-

erstrom said. “With engineering, 
everything was so much focused 
on ‘how do you solve these prob-
lems?’ There is a right answer and a 
wrong answer … Not as much about 
the social navigation side. So I 
found myself recognizing the num-
bers piece, but not thinking about 
social dynamics side of gender in 
the workplace.”

Soderstrom 
applauded 
the 

actions of the women in WiLL to 
proactively 
educate 
themselves 

about the future they face. Beyond 
the weekly meetings, on March 
31 the organization is also host-
ing a public panel, titled “WiLL 
Presents: Working Women,” that 
will be open to students across all 
majors and disciplines. This panel 

will feature four women from the Ann Arbor area — repre-
senting the Center for Education of Women, the Ann Arbor 
Community Foundation, the Conservation League of Vot-
ers, and the Ann Arbor Google office — as they answer 
questions about their careers, the obstacles they faced and 
the accomplishments they had.

Fiore hopes this event will provide insight for college-

aged women as to what they can expect entering the work-
force, which is why they focused on bringing in a wide 
range of speakers.

“We tried to bring in people with different areas of 

expertise, at different places in their careers,” she said.

Though WiLL is still reserved for OS students, both 

Fisher and Fiore hope that this flagship event will be a use-
ful resource for women on campus as they begin to figure 
out what they want to do with the rest of their lives.

WiLL’s goal is ultimately to empower women to be lead-

ers in whatever path they choose, recognizing current 
obstacles but providing the support and the confidence to 
allow women to jump over them. To get to a place where 
female leadership is not the exception but the norm.

Personal Statement: Undress the Doll

by Aiko Fukuchi, LSA Senior

U

ntil I was eleven years old, my family would take 
trips to Japan each summer. I would help my 
aunt pick plums from a tree in her backyard, and 

she would tell me stories. But I don’t speak Japanese, so I 
wouldn’t understand, and we would laugh because of this, 
and she would continue telling me stories that I wouldn’t 
understand.

We were such a great inconvenience to them, to my 

father, coming home with his American wife and his Amer-
ican children, who looked a lot like them but didn’t know 
how to interact and needed their translating father as their 
voice in every setting.

At my grandfather’s house, my aunt would take me into a 

side room where she would dress me in layers of fabric — in 
a yellow kimono with beautiful patterns and sleeves that 
almost touched the floor. She would fix and put up my long 
hair with an elegant comb made of bamboo and tell me how 
beautiful it all was. My father came in and translated for 
her; he would tell me my actions should mirror the beauty 
of how I was dressed. Sitting around a low table in the main 
room of the house, we would light incense and candles in 
my grandmother’s shrine and someone would tell the story 
of how she had been stronger than many soldiers who cried 
and crumbled at the pressure of herding families to shel-
ter during the fire bombings of WWII. Sometimes, my aunt 
would tell stories of running through streets surrounded 
by crumbling, flame-filled buildings with her mother, try-
ing to find somewhere to go. But grandfather didn’t seem to 
like those stories, and, after a few years, they ceased to be 
recognized or shared to my knowledge.

Shortly after the stories, a deliveryman usually arrived 

with boxes of sushi strapped to his bike. We sat at the table 
and ate together. There was a lot of talking; I didn’t under-
stand anything. My dad would translate every now and 
then but had trouble carrying us through the quick flow of 
conversation and would eventually give up. So I would sit 
silently with my feet tucked perfectly under my legs, smil-
ing at someone every so often to appear engaged and atten-

tive. After a few hours, someone would comment on how 
well-mannered I was. My grandfather would beam that 
my beauty and perfect manners — my sweet silence — was 
that of old, traditional, Japanese ways that had been lost 
on today’s youth, but I had shown that these ways had not 
been lost on me.

“How could a little girl raised in America be more Japa-

nese than all the little girls raised in Japan?”

Everyone would laugh. I hoped he knew I was only so 

“perfect” because a language barrier restrained me from 
participating any further.

As a child, to the relatives on my father’s side, I felt more 

like a paper doll than a part of the family. My cousins and 
aunts would gush over my snow white skin, paler than their 
own, and they would touch it, and I would feel naked, and 
my father would laugh and tell me that I am so loved, and I 
would think, there is a difference between praise and love, 
and I would tell him I didn’t feel accepted and he would tell 
me that this makes sense because I’m not truly a part of this 
world, of his world — I am only an American.

***

Twenty crushes, thirteen big lies, ten weeks of being 

grounded, seven transitions to “new homes,” three cats, 
two dogs, and one “first love” later, I was beginning my first 
year of college.

By then, most people I met didn’t call me by my name. 

I was more commonly addressed as “Asian Princess” and 
“Asian Goddess” and more often than not, felt like I was 
back in my grandfather’s house, folding my feet perfectly 
under my legs. I was picked up and spun, the same way I 
had been as a child. I was carried and talked to and talked 
at. Boys would place me on their laps and have conversa-
tions with other boys about topics I knew too little about 
to participate in. It felt the same. In my dreams, my aunt 
would take off my American clothes to make me into the 
Japanese doll she always wanted. Then men would unwrap 
me, layer by layer, to get to the Japanese doll they always 
wanted. My new nicknames found themselves a companion 

when a boy, who was pledging for a fraternity, was given 
the pledge name “Hiroshima” for having sex with me.

***

On the seventieth anniversary of Pearl Harbor, I’m 

standing outside, smoking a cigarette when two boys walk 
up to me. One asks me if I’ll feel Franklin Roosevelt spank-
ing my ancestors into internment camps when I close my 
eyes tonight. The other asks me if spanking is what I’m 
into. They tell me they wouldn’t be surprised to find out the 
Asian princess is dirty in bed. We all laugh and they walk 
away while I stand there in shock, wondering how this was 
my reaction.

***

When you ask me where I’m from, you want to know 

about my race or my ethnicity. You want to know about my 
history. You believe by knowing this about me, you’ll know 
so much about me. I imagine you don’t, but always won-
der if you pick up on my sudden shortened breathing pat-
terns due to the slight pinch of pain I feel when I tell you my 
mother is white and my father is Japanese. If you inquire 
further about family, trying to decide for yourself how Jap-
anese I really am — or how white I really am — eventually 
you start to notice discomfort weave its way through my 
body language as my eyes disengage from yours, and my 
mind wanders somewhere else, because I don’t want to talk 
about it.

I don’t want to talk about how the strongest ties I feel 

to my Japanese heritage are through micro-aggressions 
and the consistent sexual objectification of my body, orga-
nized through other’s perceptions of my race, experienced 
in the country I was raised in. I don’t want to talk about 
how almost every person I meet feels they have the ability 
to judge “how Japanese I really am,” and that I don’t even 
know what this means. What am I being judged on? What 
is the criteria? No one will tell me and my Japanese father 
will tell me if I was really Japanese I wouldn’t have to ask, 
and the stinging tears that fall from my almond-shaped 
eyes know that he’s right.

Over half a century ago, Martin Luther 

King Jr. preached at the Brown Chapel AME 
Church in Selma, Alabama — inspiring 
masses of people to risk their lives for 
freedom during the civil rights era. A teenage 
Ora Gamble was among those inspired and 
marched through the streets of Birmingham, 
where the Alabama State Troopers shot her 
down with a hose. At the 50 year anniversary 
of Bloody Sunday on March 8, 2015, Ora stood 
behind me as present-day State Troopers 
blocked the church to protect the tens of 
thousands of people who showed up for the 
jubilee. In front of us, Michael Brown Sr. led 
his family hand-in-hand, reminding us of how 
the fight for justice is not over. This union of 
past sacrifices and current movements was 
a constant presence as participants from the 
original marches crossed the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge next to young marchers singing and 
holding signs for Black Lives Matter.
