ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Friends, family 
members offer 

remarks on campus 

impact, legacy 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

The sixth annual Campus 

Memorial Service — hosted by 
the Division of Student Life and 
the Association of Religious 
Counselors — honored three 
students 
who 
passed 
away 

during the academic year with 
more than 100 students filling 
the Vandenberg Room in the 
Michigan 
League 
Monday 

afternoon. 

The 
service 
honored 

Engineering freshman Tyler 
Barthel 
and 
LSA 
seniors 

Joshua Brigham and Benjamin 
Moray. In her remarks during 
the event, Dean of Students 
Laura Blake Jones said the 
memorial was an opportunity 
for the entire community to 
come together to reflect on how 

the students impacted those 
around them and to support 
one another in a time of loss.

“This is a time to come 

together 
to 
remember 
and 

to share,” she said. “A time 
to 
grieve 
collectively 
as 

a community. The loss of 
your 
sons, 
brothers, 
loved 

ones, advisees, students and 
friends 
has 
impacted 
and 

forever altered our campus 
community.”

Prior 
to 
the 
service, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel met 
with 
family 
members 
and 

friends of the students. He did 
not attend the memorial itself.

Following 
her 
opening 

remarks, 
Jones 
read 

descriptions 
of 
the 

accomplishments of each of 
the students as a community 
member and placed a yellow 
rose next to their photograph 
in remembrance.

Friends and family members 

of each of the three students 
offered 
words 
of 
tribute 

after a musical interlude and 

Over 60 share stories 
at speak out hosted 

by LSA Student 

Government

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

More than 60 University of 

Michigan students gathered 
in the Vandenberg Room of 

the Michigan League Monday 
night to tell stories, share 
experiences and support one 
another during a mental health 
speak out sponsored by LSA 
Student Government.

The event came at a time 

when 
student 
demand 
for 

mental health resources is 
on the rise — the University’s 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services reported a 17-percent 
increase 
in 
demand 
for 

counseling service in 2014-

2015, more than four times its 
expected increase. The CAPS 
report specifies the top five 
student-identified 
mental 

health concerns as anxiety, 
depression, 
self-esteem, 

academic 
problems 
and 

relationship difficulties.

During 
Tuesday’s 
event, 

speakers shared their history 
of dealing with mental illness 
throughout college and the 
stigmas they encountered.

LSA 
sophomore 
Anna 

Giacomini, former vice chair 
of the health committee for 
LSA student government who 
helped organize the event, 
said it was based off a January 
speak out against Islamophobia 
and aimed to raise awareness 
and initiate further discussion 
about mental health on campus.

“We wanted to host an event 

that provided a safe space and 
a safe environment for people 
to talk about mental health

Faculty body tells 
Provost Pollack 

current misconduct 
policies are vague 

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs heard remarks from 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 

and 
University 
Enrollment 

Manager Kedra Ishop during 
their meeting Monday.

After 
hearing 
updates 

from Pollack on the progress 
of searches for several dean 
positions, 
SACUA 
asked 

questions of Pollack about the 
Standards Practice Guide. The 
SPG is a set of policies and 
procedures that apply to all 
University staff and faculty. 
The Office of Institutional 
Equity oversees these policies 
and sanctions.

Within the SPG, SACUA has 

been discussing over the past 
year the current grievance 
policy determines by OIE in 
the case of sexual harassment 
charges 
against 
faculty. 

At 
a 
February 
meeting, 

SACUA 
Chair 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck, prof. of comparative 
literature, said the grievance 
policy is currently unclear and 
requires clarification.

During Monday’s meeting, 

Weineck emphasized that the 
current policy is overly vague 
and makes it easy for faculty 

to be accused of not following 
the policies.

“We’re worried because you 

could argue that any behavior 
could 
violate 
the 
SPG,” 

Weineck said.

In its meeting last month, 

SACUA 
compared 
faculty 

policies on sexual misconduct 
to the newly released updated 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy 

for students, which allows 
students to file grievances on 
findings of sexual misconduct. 
Under 
current 
policies, 

University faculty may file 
grievances against sanctions 
but not against findings on 
cases of misconduct.

Pollack declined to discuss 

SACUA’s 
requests 
at 
the 

meeting and did not comment 
on the vagueness of the guide, 
though she noted she was 
open to conversation in the 
future. Pollack also said the 
University wanted to see the 
student policy roll out before 
considering a change to the 
current faculty process. In 
September, Pollack saidseveral 
changes had been made to 
how grievances function for 
faculty — including a second 
step in the process and a 
standardized e-mail template 
— in response to a SACUA 
request.

“There’s too many moving 

parts,” Pollack said. “I want 
to see student policy put in 
place, and then I am willing 
to entertain consideration of 
what we might do for faculty. 
But I have not had time to 
entertain and consider what

Students say Ryan 

Ball’s teaching 

prepares them for life 
outside the classroom

By NEIL SCHWARTZ

Daily Staff Reporter 

Ryan Ball, assistant professor 

of accounting at the Ross School 
of Business, is the 2016 recipient 
of the Golden Apple Award.

Created in 1991, the Golden 

Apple Award seeks to honor 
teachers who consistently teach 
every lecture as if it were their 
last. As a part of the award, each 
recipient is invited to speak to 
the University of Michigan on a 
topic that they would choose as 
their “last lecture.”

LSA sophomore John Petrie, 

who serves on the Golden 
Apple selection committee that 
determines the winner each 
year, said Ball’s nomination 
was a standout among the 
approximately 1,000 votes the 
committee received this year 
from students. 

“This year it was an easy one,” 

Petrie said. “Because when you 
have a record-breaking number 
of nominations (for Ball), many 
of which are heartfelt and 
lengthy, it’s not too difficult of a 
selection to make.”

Petrie 
emphasized 
the 

comprehensive selection process 
that 
goes 
beyond 
just 
the 

quantity of votes each nominee 
receives from students.

“There’s not a rigid criteria

In remarks at 

ceremony, Schlissel 
notes importance of 
research preservation

By CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

After being closed for more 

than two years during a $17 
million renovation, the William 
Clements 
Library 
officially 

re-opened 
with 
a 
ribbon 

cutting ceremony Monday.

The new library, located 

on 
South 
University 
Ave, 

includes 
a 
structural 

addition of a 3,000-square-
foot underground space for 
rare document preservation 
beneath the library’s front 
lawn.

Other 
updates 
to 
the 

building 
include 
a 
new 

digitization lab, a relocation of 
the reading room to the main 
floor, a redone basement office 
space for library staffers and 
a basement space for lectures 
and presentations.

Additionally, the library’s 

security, 
climate 
control, 

electrical 
systems 
and 

plumbing were updated.

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

gave remarks at the ribbon 

cutting 
ceremony, 
speaking 

on the library’s steps about its 
unparalleled opportunity for 
education and research.

“The Clements is one of 

the 
premier 
depositories 

of American history in the 
entire world,” Schlissel said. 
“It provides an advantage to 
the University of Michigan 
that 
very 
few 
can 
claim; 

having access to the materials 
that we have here leads to a 
superior learning and research 
experience.”

The library was built in 

1923 by William Clements, a 
University alum who served 
as a regent from 1909 to 1933.

Alpha Epsilon Pi 
hosts performance 
featuring comedy 

sketches

By EMMA PERPICH

For the Daily

The 
Lydia 
Mendelssohn 

Theatre was filled with glow 
sticks, glow in the dark juggling 
and the laughs of more than 
300 community members at the 
comedy show and charity benefit 
“Laughter is the Cure,” hosted 
by Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity 
Tuesday.

“Laughter is the Cure” is 

a comedy tour group whose 
performances feature stand up 
comedy, video skits and juggling 
performances. Funds raised at 
the performances go toward the 
C.S. Mott Children’s hospital.

Michigan 
State 
University 

student Sam Silverstein, who 
created “Laughter is the Cure,” 
did much of the comedy alongside 
friend Nick Tangalia, a Berkeley 
resident. The two comedians 
said “Laughters is the Cure” 
performances allow the audience 
a night of laughter, while giving 
back to the children at Mott.

”It was a way to do something 

greater with comedy, a way to do 
something better for the world 
while getting our names out 
there,” Silverstein said.

The two are both relatively 

new to performing, and said 
they use the shows as a chance to 
gain some recognition while also 
benefitting a greater purpose.

“It’s a ‘you scratch our back, 

we scratch yours’ kind of deal,” 
Tangalia said.

The 
comedy 
duo 
has 

performed at Michigan State 
University, Grand Valley State 
University and other comedy 
clubs in Michigan. This was their 
first show at the University of 

Michigan.

As 
a 
visiting 
Spartan, 

Silverstein opened with a few 
jokes to ease the tension between 
the two rival schools.

“You guys have a business 

school called Ross — I have a 
drug dealer named Ross who I do 
business with,” he said.

He also found common ground 

between the two schools when he 
had the whole audience scream 
an epithet against Ohio State 
University.

Along with stand-up comedy 

routines, the performers also 
used glow in the dark juggling, 
morphsuits and Neil Diamond 
sing-alongs 
to 
entertain 
the 

audience.

Education junior Sammy Dean, 

a longtime friend of Silverstein 
who attended Tuesday’s show, 
said he’s been impressed with the 
success of “Laughter is the Cure.”

“I remember when he first 

got started with everything — I 
didn’t know how it would turn 
out and it was unbelievable,” 
Dean said. “He is just so funny 
and so talented.”

Engineering 
sophomore 

Justin Rogers said he both 
enjoyed 
the 
show 
and 

appreciated 
that 
the 
funds 

would be going toward benefiting 
children in need.

“It was great to see (Silverstein) 

and the others doing things that 
they love and also doing it for a 
great cause,” Rogers said. 

Silverstein said they raised a 

total of $4,500, not including tips 

and lobby donations, at the show 
to benefit the children’s hospital. 
The proceeds will go toward toys, 
games and other entertainment 
to make a patient’s hospital stay 
more comfortable.

Moving forward, the duo has 

a few more shows on schedule 

in the southeastern Michigan 
area, and said they’re looking to 
expand their tour in upcoming 
shows to other universities like 
OSU.

“We want to keep the focus on 

helping children, on bringing fun 
to the kids,” Silverstein said.

Over the years, the collection 
has since expanded to include 
over 
80,000 
books, 
letters 

written by George Washington 
and Christopher Columbus, as 
well as maps of the Americas 
from the 15th through 19th 
centuries.

“Our mission is collecting, 

preserving and making available 
for research original primary 
sources on American history 
from 1492 through the 19th 
century,” said Clements Library 
Director Kevin Graffagnino at 
the ceremony.

Schlissel 
joked 
that 
he 

was grateful that the noise 
that came with the library’s 

renovation 
was 
finally 

complete, given the proximity 
of the president’s house to the 
construction site.

“I live right next door, so, 

as any neighbor would say, 
I’m actually delighted that the 
construction part of this is 
done,” Schlissel said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Christy 

Finkenstaedt, 
William 

Clement’s 
great-great-

granddaughter, said Clement’s 
contribution to the University 
in 1923 continues to have an 
impact today.

“Today, with the dedication 

of this expanded space, the 
inspiration contained in the 
collections will continue to 
be accessible to many future 
generations of students and 
historians,” Finkenstaedt said. 

Following the ribbon cutting, 

Mark Dimunation, chief of the 
rare book division at the Library 
of Congress, gave an address 
at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art, stressing the 
importance of libraries such as 
Clements in preserving original 
documents.

“We must remember that 

even ordinary objects allow 
us insight into the emotional 
and 
intellectual 
experiences 

of those who lived with them, 
providing visible, tangible links 
to an otherwise unrecoverable 
past,” Dimunation said.

Dimunation also said the new 

digitization lab in Clements 
will allow the past to be better 
preserved and accessible.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Javier Taylor said he had always 

been curious about the library, 
and was walking by Tuesday 
when he noticed it was the 
re-opening.

“I’ve always walked by the 

library, but for as long as I’ve 
been here it’s been closed,” 
Taylor said. “I honestly didn’t 
know much about it before, but 
it seems like a very cool place.”

Taylor added that he will 

utilize the Friday hours when 
the library is open to the public, 
saying it could potentially be a 
good alternative to the louder 
atmosphere 
of 
the 
Shapiro 

Undergraduate Library.

Starting 
this 
week, 
the 

library will be open for research 
Monday through Wednesday 
from 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and 
Thursday from 9 a.m. to 7:45 
p.m.

Phi Delta Epsilon and EkoAmazon 

fundraised near the posting wall in 
Mason Hall yesterday for seperate 
nonprofits. 

 Pre-medical fraternity Phi Delta 

Epsilon sold Krispy Kreme doughnuts 
in Mason Hall for the Children’s 
Miracle Network, an organization 
that raises money for local children’s 
hospitals.

LSA sophomore Heather Martin 

said Phi Delta Epsilon primarily 
fundraises for CMN. She added that 
Phi Delta Epsilon’s president recently 
attended CMN’s national convention 
in Florida and found it to be a positive 
experience.

“(The chapter president) learned 

all these great fundraising ideas and 
they even met a few of the kids and 
saw where our money goes,” Martin 
said. “They had such powerful stories 
and she came back and shared them 
with us. We’re just picking up more 
fundraisers so that hopefully we can 
give more money to our foundation.”

Martin noted the group has 

encountered some difficulties because 
they are a new student organization.

“Our last founding member is 

graduating this year, so we’re about 
four or five years old,” she said. “We 
have been fundraising in the past, 
but it’s a slow process getting started, 

and there’s so many organizations 
fundraising, so we’re constantly 
coming up with new ideas, whether 
it’s small ones like bake sales or our 
student convention we had a couple 
of months ago, where we brought in 
some guest speakers.”

The University of Michigan’s 

chapter of EkoAmazon, a larger 
nonprofit organization that promotes 
health care sustainability through 
education in Peru and villages across 
the Amazon River, also tabled near the 
posting wall to raise funds for a trip to 
Peru this summer and next year.

LSA freshman Anu Roy-

Chaudhary said because their 
organization has only existed for one 
year, they were not able to take any 
of their members on the alternative 

Spring Break trip offered by their 
national organization.

Roy-Chaudhary added that 

the ASB trip, as well as summer 
expeditions that are offered, allow 
students to volunteer in different 
villages along the Amazon.

“They get you to interact with the 

kids; you teach and you also help with 
sustainability — so bringing water 
filters down and things like that,” 
Roy-Chaudhary said. “There’s a huge 
disparity in water allocation and clean 
water in Peru.”

Roy-Chaudhary said she had 

taken a trip to Peru during her junior 
year of high school and was inspired 
to join EkoAmazon because of her 
experiences.

Deaths tied to 
Legionnaires’ 
disease grows to 
12 in Flint area

State health officials added 

two more counts to the number 
of deaths associated with 
Legionnaires’ disease — a severe 
form of pneumonia — in the 
Flint area, bringing the total 
to 12, the Detroit Free Press 
reported.

During a 17-month period 

in 2014 and 2015 there were 
91 confirmed cases in Genesee 
County where Flint is located. 
In previous years, six to 13 cases 
generally would be confirmed 
each year.

The outbreak has not been 

definitively linked to the 
water crisis in the area, but 
the increase in instances of 
the illness began after Flint 
switched its water supply to the 
Flint River in 2014. 

Investigators have been 

looking at potential exposure 
sites including hospitals, water 
and community venues. 

McLaren Flint — an area 

hospital — tested for the 
Legionella bacteria in 2014 while 
there was an increase in concern 
over the number of cases and 
the safety of the water supply. 
The hospital found low levels of 
the bacteria, but officials said 
they responded rapidly with 
preventative measures.

The hospital and several 

current and former employees 
of the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality are being 
sued by families who suffered or 
died from the disease.

Michigan nuclear 
plant cleans up 
following oil spill

There was an investigation 

into and a cleanup of an oil spill 
at a southwest Michigan nuclear 
plant on Monday, the Detroit 
Free Press reported. 

The spill occurred at the 

D.C. Cook nuclear plant on the 
shore of Lake Michigan after a 
transformer failure resulted in 
approximately 25,000 gallons of 
oil being released. 

Most of the oil released was 

contained by a protective berm 
surrounding the transfomer, but 
approximately 2,000 gallons 
escaped to spill onto the ground 
outside of it. However, there is 
no current radioactive threat.

Oil did not reach the nearby 

drains or Lake Michigan, so the 
cleanup is limited to the soil, 
where the oil will need to be 
recaptured. 

The cause of the failure is 

currently under investigation. 
The transformer in question is 
relatively new, so it is unknown 
why it broke down. 

The plant has an additional 

transformer unit, so it will 
remain operational. 

‘U’ to co-sponsor 
annual e-waste 
recycling event

The University will host a 

three-day e-waste recycling 
event in coordination with Ann 
Arbor Public Schools, working 
toward campus sustainability 
goals that focus on engaging the 
community, according to a press 
release.

As a part of the event, 

the University will accept 
electronics such as laptop and 
desktop computers, tablets, 
cellular phones and audio and 
video equipment to be recycled. 

The event will be open to 

the public, local businesses and 
nonprofit organizations. 

E-waste is currently the 

fastest growing municipal waste 
stream in the country. Rapid 
techonology changes and falling 
prices have caused surplus 
waste as individuals quickly 
switch to new devices, according 
to the release.

Electronics often contain 

toxic materials, which can leak 
into ground water resulting in 
pollution. Proper recycling of 
technology can curb this risk.

the recital of the Litany of 
Remembrance.

Brigham was a member of 

Chi Phi fraternity who, Jones 
said, dreamed of graduating 
from the University with a 
degree in psychology. She said 
he wanted to use his degree to 
work with children, which was 
one of his greatest passions as a 
Special Olympics coach.

Michelle 
Leiterman, 

Brigham’s mother, spoke about 
her son, recalling his great love 
for the University. She pointed 
to the maize and blue tie he was 
photographed in that had been 
passed down from his great-
grandfather, and said the day he 
was accepted to the University 
was the happiest day of his life.

She said the only aspect 

of Brigham greater than his 
kindness was his smile.

“The only thing bigger than 

Joshua’s heart was that grin 
he always wore,” she said. 
“Looking back it really is a rare 
photo where he wasn’t smiling.”

Jones 
said 
Barthel’s 

professors characterized him as 
an eager and talented student, 
noting his passion for robotics 
and computer science, and that 
he was a dedicated volunteer at 
his church.

Angela Farrehi, director of 

the Office of Student Support 
and Accountability, spoke about 
Barthel by reading an excerpt 
from his admission essay for the 
College of Engineering. Barthel 
wrote he felt most at peace 
when using his computer, as it 
gave him access to countless 
possibilities.

“My desktop is a window into 

the larger world,” he wrote. 

“There is nowhere that I feel 
more content than siting at my 
computer. When I’m sitting at 
my computer I can do all sorts of 
work. I can also have a limitless 
source of entertainment.”

Moray was a member of 

Sigma Alpha Epsilon — prior 
to its disbandment — who 
was studying screen arts and 
culture. Jones said he dreamed 
of one day graduating and rising 
to the top of the entertainment 
industry.

Business 
senior 
Anthony 

Clewlow spoke about Moray, 
who was his fraternity brother 
and roommate. He said Moray 
was one of the happiest people 
he knew and had more friends 
than he could count. Moray 
was the pledge-class president 
for Sigma Alpha Epsilon their 
freshman year. Clewlow said 
Moray’s confidence and fearless 
leadership created a strong 
bond within their pledge class.

“Although he only lived a 

short 22 years, he did more than 
most people do in a lifetime,” 
he said. “As a leader he was 
fearless and above all confident. 
He turned a random group of 20 
guys into friends.”

Both 
Barthel 
and 
Moray 

will be awarded posthumous 
degrees during the upcoming 
spring commencement.

LSA junior Joel Battsek, 

a friend of Moray, said he 
appreciated 
the 
University 

hosting the event to create a 
space for the community to 
come together to remember 
those who have left it.

“I think it was really nice 

that they do this for you,” he 
said. “It was really touching 
to hear from everyone, and it’s 
very important to reflect not 
just in the moment but at a later 
date.”

as to how the selection goes,” 
Petrie said. “Some years there’s 
going to be the person who has 
the most in number as far as 
nominations. And some years 
it’s not, because there are going 
to be some comments that seem 
very heartfelt and long.”

Originally an engineer by 

trade, Ball said credited his 
success as a professor to his 
wife’s decision to return to 
school 
and 
his 
accounting 

professor 
who 
drove 
him 

to enroll in MBA and Ph.D. 
programs at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

“In my first accounting class 

I took, my instructor made a 
blanket offer to the class,” Ball 
said. “And he said, ‘Hey, there’s 
a real shortage of accounting in 
academics. I would like any of 
you to come talk to me about a 
Ph.D.’ So I took him up on the 
offer and the rest is history.”

Speaking to his decision to 

transition from engineering 
to business, Ball highlighted 
the human interaction aspect 
of business that may not be as 
large a part of engineering.

“Engineering tends to be 

focused on the known aspect, 
you design stuff the way you 
know it,” Ball said. “Whereas 
in business it’s about human 
interactions with real financial 

models and financial markets. 
It’s got a little bit of everything 
having to do with the human 
race.”

Concerning the classroom, 

Ball said he likes to bring a 
sense of importance, energy 
and compassion to both his 
work and interactions with 
students.

“It’s about bringing energy 

and enthusiasm and just a little 
bit of compassion and caring 
to the classroom that I think 
goes a heck of a long way,” Ball 
said. “I think that’s important 
in 
today’s 
environment 

where business schools are 
always at the leading edge of 
innovation.”

Attesting to these qualities, 

Business 
master’s 
student 

Celia Boren, one of Ball’s 
accounting students, said she 
enjoys the way Ball makes more 
convoluted material become 
straightforward.

“He 
makes 
the 
topic 

(of 
accounting) 
extremely 

approachable,” 
Boren 
said. 

“And something that is complex 
makes sense to people with a 
wide variety of experiences.”

Ball 
also 
cited 
taking 

feedback seriously as a vital 
part of classroom learning. To 
demonstrate his commitment 
to it, he asks students to voice 
that feedback through his 
own form at the start of the 
semester. 

“I 
distribute 
my 
own, 

personal mid-course feedback 
form three weeks in,” he said. 
“And a lot of time, there are 
things in there that I can do to 
change (the class).”

Through placing importance 

on hearing what his students 
have to say about, Ball said 
he strives to create a unique 
dynamic in each of his classes.

“Every class is different, so 

every class requires a different 
approach,” Ball said. “It’s not 
that I’m trying to find the one 
size fits all. What works for 
one class may not work for next 
year’s class. It’s always about 
adjusting and adapting.”

Business master’s student 

Abbey Maglaris, another of 
Ball’s accounting students, said 
she now feels more confident in 
applying accounting material to 
real life situations.

“I think Ryan and his 

class 
have 
given 
me 
the 

ability and the confidence 
to understand what’s in the 
content,” Maglaris said. “(I) 
feel comfortable looking at it 
on my own or taking a stab at 
interpreting something that I 
wouldn’t have felt comfortable 
doing before.”

Maglaris 
and 
Boren 

both 
compared 
Ball 
to 
a 

dolphin, saying he is fluid, 
energetic, intelligent and very 
approachable.

“He sets the bar high,” Boren 

said. “But he also never doubts 
that you can get there.”

we could do with faculty.”

Pollack added that faculty 

sexual 
harassment 
policies 

are much more complex than 
student policies.

“You can’t just cut and paste 

because student issues usually 
don’t have a power imbalance 
for the most part,” Pollack 
said. “Technically, faculty are 
employees so there are a whole 
bunch of different laws.”

In a recent interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Pollack 
said Weineck and SACUA were 
aware the University intended 
to focus on student sexual 
misconduct 
policies 
before 

revising policies for faculty and 
other employees.

“I have said to SACUA all 

along — and Silke knows this, 
she’s on board with this — that 
we were updating the student 
sexual misconduct policy, and 
when that was done, we would 
revisit the appealing processes 
for faculty,” she said.

During the interview, Pollack 

declined 
to 
discuss 
what 

processes for amending current 
policies for faculty and staff 
would entail.

SACUA also raised questions 

about a possible social media 
policy for faculty during their 
conversation with Pollack. The 
University does not currently 
have a social media policy for 

faculty to follow.

Pollack said she would 

consider the idea, though 
she 
noted 
many 
issues 

stemming 
from 
social 

media could apply to other 
policies.

“You 
could 
imagine 

cases that could fall under 
other 
policies,” 
Pollack 

said. “For example, if you 
were threatening a student 
directly, that would fall 
under another category.”

John Lehmanm SACUA 

member and Professor of 
Biology, said governing OIE 
and SPG go hand-in-hand 
and 
said 
administration 

should address the issues 
together.

“There’s going to have 

to be some dovetailing of 
SPG and OIE discussions,” 
Lehman said.

The 
committee 
also 

addressed 
recent 
anti-

Islam chalkings on the Diag 
which University President 
Mark Schlissel and Central 
Student 
Government 

President 
Cooper 

Charlton responded to in a 
University-wide e-mail last 
week.

“You have to respect free 

speech no matter how heinous, 
and also be respectful of the 
fact some students feel very, 
very hurt,” Pollack said.

Ishop, SACUA’s other guest, 

the enrollment manager at the 
University answered questions 

largely about admissions, as 
well explained how faculty is 
involved in admissions. She 
also addressed financial aid, 
diversity on campus and how 
each of the schools differ in 
admissions processes.

“The faculty engagement is 

done at a committee level about 
helping us make decisions about 
students we admit,” Ishop said.

During her remarks, Ishop 

highlighted how the University 
has increased its yield over 
the last year — meaning a 
higher number of the students 

accepted are committing to the 
University.

“What you would have seen 

prior to the last couple years 
was a little bit of a decline,” 
Ishop said. “What we’ve seen 
in the last two years is a steady 
uptake.”

and stop the stigma that mental 
health issues are a bad thing,” 
Giacomini said. “Because a lot 
of people suffer from them.”

Giacomini noted that she 

and other student government 
students are also currently 
working on initiatives to get 
CAPS 
extended 
to 
North 

Campus. She also stressed that 
given the prevalence of mental 
health issues on campus, it’s 
important for students to know 
they are not alone and have a 
large student support system 
available.

LSA 
freshman 
Michael 

Sacchetti, current chair of the 
health committee, said the 
event was meant to create a 
welcoming 
environment 
for 

students battling mental health 
issues.

“It’s 
really 
important 

especially to make it aware 
that students do battle mental 
health 
issues 
on 
campus,” 

Sacchetti said.

At the event, many students 

were hesitant to share their 
stories at first, but eventually 
one by one — even those who 
said initially they were not 
planning to speak — shared 
stories expressing the need for 
compassion, 
awareness, 
and 

increased resources for those 
with mental health issues.

In 
her 
remarks, 
LSA 

sophomore 
Lauren 
Matson 

expressed frustration with the 
University’s response to student 
demands for more resources, 
though she also acknowledged 
the work administrators are 
doing in an interview after the 
speak out.

“Mental health stigma on 

this campus and on any college 
campus 
is 
so 
prevalent,” 

Matson said. “And, because it 
has been something that I have 
been constantly dealing with, I 
really wanted to come and just 
encourage others that they’re 
not alone in this.”

Marjorie 
Horton, 

LSA 
assistant 
dean 
for 

undergraduate education, said 
she attended the event because 
she believes faculty support was 
crucial to supporting students 
with mental health problems.

“The 
event 
was 
really 

valuable both in terms of giving 
students a safe space to share 
their stories and also inform 
other students here about the 
range of resources and how 
important it is to support 
friends 
who 
are 
suffering 

from mental health concerns,” 
Horton said.

LSA 
senior 
Marlee 

Beckering, who also attended 
the event, is a part of the 

“Help 
CAPS 
Catch 
Up” 

project, an initiative centered 
around collecting names from 
students to later use in letters 
to 
administrators 
regarding 

requests for increased mental 
health resources on campus. 
Beckering 
said 
the 
largest 

demand “Help CAPS Catch Up” 
is pursuing is to increase the 
budget for CAPS, echoing some 
of the concerns of speak out 
participants.

“(We will be) asking for 

specific things that we want to 
see enacted on campus in terms 
of mental health resources,” 
Beckering said. “Right now, we 
are not covering the entirety of 
our campus.”

“S

o the men turned from 
there, and went toward 
Sodom, while Abraham 

remained 
standing before 
the LORD. Then 
Abraham 
came 

near and said, 
‘Will you indeed 
sweep away the 
righteous 
with 

the wicked? … 
Far be it from 
you to do such a 
thing, to slay the 
righteous 
with 

the wicked, so 
that the righteous fare as the wicked! 
Far be that from you! Shall not the 
Judge of all the earth do what is just?’ 
” — Genesis 19:22-25 

One person should not be punished 

for the acts committed by another. 
Most people, regardless of whether 
they abide by the moral codes of 
the Abrahamic religions, probably 
agree with this basic moral principle 
and therefore exclude collective 
punishment from their conceptions 
of justice.

Unfortunately, the Jewish state, 

the Judge of all between the Jordan 
and the Sea, has regularly imposed 
collective 
punishment 
on 
the 

Palestinians. We could cite many 
examples, from the killing of more 
than 50 inhabitants of the Palestinian 
village of Qibya in October 1953 to 
the two major Israeli assaults on 
Gaza since my Bar Mitzvah, in 2008 
and 2014. But the example that I 
want to highlight here is Israel’s 
policy of punitive home demolitions, 
whereby the Israeli military, the 
Israeli Defense Forces, demolishes 
the homes of Palestinians suspected 
of crimes against Israelis.

The 
IDF 
began 
demolishing 

Palestinian homes as punishment in 
1967, when Israel first occupied the 
West Bank and Gaza. By the outbreak 
of the first intifada (i.e., Palestinian 
uprising) in December 1987, the IDF 
had demolished almost 1,400 housing 
units. During the first intifada, Israel 
increased the rate of punitive home 
demolition, destroying 431 housing 
units as punishment in just four 
years.

From October 2001 to November 

2004, during the second intifada, also 
known as the al-Aqsa intifada, Israel 
demolished 628 housing units. These 
628 units were demolished because 
of the acts of 333 Palestinians, but 
they were the homes of almost 
4,000 people. Roughly half of the 
homes 
demolished 
were 
never 

home to a Palestinian suspected of 
attacks against Israelis. According 
to the Israeli human rights non-
governmental 
organization 

B’Tselem, in only 3 percent of cases 
did the IDF give the occupants prior 

notification before demolishing their 
homes.

To its credit, the IDF temporarily 

stopped 
demolishing 
homes 
as 

punishment in 2005 after an Israeli 
government report found that it 
rarely worked as a deterrent for 
terrorism — the avowed purpose 
of the program — and instead only 
further inflamed hostility. However, 
the memory of its own governmental 
report apparently faded, as in 2009 
the IDF sealed two housing units 
and demolished another in East 
Jerusalem, causing 28 people to lose 
their homes.

Since 
the 
summer 
of 
2014, 

after three yeshiva students were 
abducted and killed, the Israeli 
government officially decided to 
re-implement the ineffective policy. 
In July 2014, the IDF demolished the 
homes of two Hamas men suspected 
of carrying out the attacks, leaving 
eight people homeless, including 
four children. By year’s end, the IDF 
had demolished four homes, leaving 
27 people homeless, including 13 
minors. In 2015, 11 apartments 
were demolished by official order, 
rendering an additional 14 nearby 
apartments uninhabitable, leaving 
85 people homeless, including 43 
minors. Since last October, the IDF 
has demolished and fully or partially 
sealed 36 homes.

Just last week, the IDF demolished 

four families’ homes, punishing 28 
people, including six minors, for the 
actions of three Palestinians, who 
were already dead at the time of the 
demolitions.

Please pause to reflect on these 

numbers.

How does Israel justify its return 

to this policy? In November 2014, 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu, 
vowed 
to 
demolish 

the homes of more families of east 
Jerusalem attackers. He said, “We 
have nothing against the residents 
of eastern Jerusalem, but we will 
not tolerate attacks on our citizens 
and we will act against those who 
do these things and against those 
engaged in incitement … With a 
determined and vigorous hand, we 
will restore security to Jerusalem.”

That same week, the IDF released 

this statement: “The destruction of 
terrorists’ homes sends a sharp, clear 
message to those who wish to harm 
Israeli civilians and security forces, 
that terrorism and causing harm 
to innocents carries with it a heavy 
price.”

A moment’s reflection reveals 

how these justifications are totally 
bankrupt. Rarely do these home 
demolitions 
amount 
to 
acting 

directly against those who attack 
Israelis, 
because 
typically 
the 

assailants 
aren’t 
living 
in 
the 

homes at the time of demolition, as 

Netanyahu is no doubt well aware. 
Furthermore, home demolition itself, 
the “heavy price” imposed by the IDF 
for terrorism and causing harm to 
innocents, amounts to terrorism and 
causing harm to innocents. Hence 
Israel cannot pretend to hold the 
moral high ground over Palestinians 
terrorists when it, too, engages in 
terrorism and harms innocents.

Aside 
from 
transgressing 

conventional morality, Israel’s policy 
of punitive home demolition violates 
international law (see here, under 
the headings “war crime,” “collective 
punishment” 
and 
“denying 
the 

right to due process” for further 
discussion). The United States, for 
our part, supports Israel as it runs 
afoul of international law, to the tune 
of billions of dollars in annual aid. So 
long as the United States continues 
to support Israel, you and I, insofar 
as we pay our taxes, bear personal 
responsibility for these illegal and 
immoral punitive home demolitions.

Lastly, a personal note: As a Jew, 

I am acutely aware of how anti-
Semitic regimes throughout history 
— in Czarist Russia, Nazi Germany 
and elsewhere — denied my people 
our right to housing, and so I believe 
it is a moral imperative to speak out 
when this right is denied to others, 
especially by the Jewish state.

During our Passover seders in 

a few weeks, we Jews will both 
celebrate the Israelites’ liberation 
and our current freedom as well 
as 
observe 
how 
today 
people 

throughout the world still live in 
slavery and oppression. It has been 
my understanding throughout my 
Jewish upbringing that, as Jews, we 
are meant to feel others’ oppression 
as our oppression, since we, too, 
know what it is like to have been 
slaves, to be forced from our homes 
in Russia, in Germany, Poland and 
elsewhere.

Perhaps one might argue that it 

is not our duty, Americans and Jews 
alike, to eradicate oppression from 
the world. Very well, but let us at 
least not participate in it. Let us, the 
Jews, not repeat the crimes of our 
historic oppressors by denying the 
Palestinians their right to housing, 
among so many other rights that 
Israel denies them. We should 
demand that the government of Israel 
immediately 
cease 
demolishing 

homes as punishment. In 1953, 
following the Qibya massacre, the 
United States temporarily suspended 
all economic aid to Israel in order to 
express its disapproval. The United 
States should do so again now until 
Israel agrees to end its policy of 
harming the innocent for the crimes 
of the wicked.

W

hen I get home, my daily 
routine usually involves 
throwing 
my 
phone 

on the charger 
before 
it 
dies, 

figuring out what 
I am going to 
eat and starting 
on 
whatever 

homework 
awaits 
me 
for 

the 
evening. 

Given 
recent 

advancements 
in 
charging 

technologies, my 
phone 
reaches 

100 percent before I even sit down 
to eat. Despite nearing the brink of 
a dead phone battery every day, I 
cannot remember the last time my 
phone actually died.

However, I can tell you about the 

exhaustion I feel every day when 
I finally sit down for dinner. It is a 
known fact that college students sleep 
less than the general population. As 
extracurriculars, student jobs and 
GPAs become more important for 
getting a job after graduation, this 
trend seems to be here to stay. In 
fact, it is quite commonplace for me 
to hear my friends discuss pulling 
multiple all-nighters in the UGLi 
during finals week.

The technology we rely on to 

conduct such exhaustive work has 
advanced to a point that exceeds 
our bodily output. While I sit on 
my couch at 8 p.m., writing a paper 
and fighting off the urge to sleep, 

my phone and my laptop sit plugged 
in, fully charged and ready to keep 
working. As my roommate downs 
a can of Red Bull in a computer lab 
on North Campus at 2 a.m., the 
computer he is using stares back 
at him, seemingly unaware of the 
concept of exhaustion.

This 
dynamic 
of 
always-on, 

always-ready 
technology 
has 

created a society that never sleeps. 
Students 
clamor 
to 
work 
for 

technology companies despite the 
impending 
more-than-full-time 

workload they know awaits them. 
In the off chance we do catch 
some Z’s, our phones often lie on 
our nightstands, alive and ready 
for work the moment we wake up. 
While human beings physically 
need eight hours of sleep per night 
to function properly, I cannot tell 
you the last time my phone sat docile 
and in a state of sleep for more than 
eight minutes.

As finals approach, this situation 

will only get worse. The nature of 
high-pressure, high-reward exams 
forces college students to overwork 
their power cores. In this context, it is 
understandable to think of our brains 
as computers; we try to cram as much 
information into them every day 
without stopping to think about the 
recharge cycle necessary to power 
our internal batteries. However, it is 
important to remind ourselves of the 
ramifications of these actions.

Consider your current phone. 

Odds are good that you bought that 
device within the past two years. 

With the way cell phone upgrades 
go, the odds also suggest you will 
replace that device within the next 
two years, if not sooner. Though the 
batteries on these devices may seem 
invincible while you use them, they 
will be thrown away in less than 
one-fortieth of the average lifespan 
of a human heart. Unfortunately, 
humans cannot swap out their hearts 
for the iHeart 6S next year.

In 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 

condition of our one and only 
battery, we must turn off. Much 
to our chagrin, there is no quick 
charging, wireless charging or 
battery swapping allowed. Sleep 
is the only way to adequately 
recharge our batteries for proper 
functioning. As much as we like to 
believe energy drinks, coffee and 
Adderall can replace sleep, these 
only serve to attack and weaken our 
batteries themselves. It is tempting 
to compete with our electronic 
devices and their never-ending 
persistence, but we must cede the 
battle and shut down every day.

As I type this, my eyes are 

beginning to tire and my thoughts are 
starting to fade. My laptop’s battery 
reads full, but I know there is no way 
I can keep up until it dies. I’m asking 
you to consider your battery the next 
time you ponder an all-nighter. After 
all, if it dies, there will be no way to 
plug it in and recharge for your exam 
next week.

RAINS 

E

very 
semester, 
I 
spend 
hours 

researching classes and professors 
before registering for the upcoming 

term. I read course guide 
descriptions 
and 
old 

syllabi, talk to friends or 
alumni who’ve taken the 
classes 
I’m 
considering, 

scroll through the lists 
of best and worst classes 
maintained 
by 
several 

student organizations I’m 
part of, read reviews of 
the professors and classes 
I’m considering on Rate 
My Professors, and ask 
favorite professors for their 
opinions on courses and colleagues in their 
department.

But information about some classes is hard to 

come by. For small classes or those with highly 
specific subject matter, I often find myself 
relying on the opinions of one or two people, 
which can cause problems because it’s almost 
impossible to tell whether those few students 
have given me a picture of the class or if they 
represent the minorities at either end of the 
spectrum who either loved or hated the class. 
In other words, do they fall in the red, yellow 
or green zones of this hypothetical bell chart 
about a hypothetical class that does not exist?

There is, of course, a fairly simple way to 

solve this problem — make course information 
available for every class. In late March, the 
University of Michigan released Academic 
Reporting Tools 2.0, a new tool for students 
that does just that. Well … kind of.

ART 2.0 provides basic information about 

the major, year and school distributions, as 
well as the pre-, co- and post-enrollment data 
of every student who’s taken the class in the 
past five years. It also gives their aggregated 
course evaluation responses to at least two 
questions: Their desire to take the course 
and whether or not they learned a lot from 
the course. For some courses, the site also 
provides information on whether students 
thought the class had a heavy workload.

The University has been using ART 

internally since 2006, but, for the first time, in 
March 2016, they made certain data available to 
students. Releasing course evaluation data has 
been extremely controversial among faculty: 
The Faculty Senate voted in the fall to suspend 
releasing the information to students until it 
could draft policies to govern the information.

Physics Prof. Gus Evrard, who leads the 

ART 2.0 project, told the Daily, “Originally, 
we had some ideas of showing more 
information, and then in consulting with 
faculty colleagues we decided to step back … 
there were some trade-offs that we needed to 
make in order to get here.”

Despite the fact that access to any course 

evaluation data at all is a win for students — 
who pay to take these classes — the limited 
amount of information available through 
ART 2.0 substantially undercuts the site’s 
utility. The course evaluation data provided 
on ART 2.0 is exclusively quantitative and 
never provides information on specific 
professors — just classes.

The site includes aggregated answers to 

just two of the four questions asked on all 
evaluations. Strikingly, the omitted questions 
are the ones that ask students to indicate 
the degree to which they agree with the 
statements: “Overall, this was an excellent 
course” and “overall, the instructor was an 
excellent teacher.” The site only reports the 
percentages of students who “had a strong 
desire to take this course” and “learned a 
great deal” from this course.

The site only provides one metric that 

assesses the quality of a course: The percentage 
of students who polled that they either “agree” 
or “strongly agree” that they “learned a great 
deal” from the course. For one thing, I’m 
not sure that I’ve ever not responded that I 
“learned a great deal” from a class on a course 
evaluation, partly because it’s a pretty vague, 
broad question.

Even if a professor graded unfairly, almost 

never engaged with students and aimlessly 
rambled during lectures, I think it would be 
hard not to learn a great deal from a course, 
as long as my prior exposure to the material 
was limited and I completed a majority of the 
required work. I could probably “learn a great 
deal” from a class just by doing the assigned 
readings and studying for the exams.

But, because “learned a great deal” is not 

defined in course evaluation questionnaires, 
other students may interpret that question 
differently. Some may respond according to 
whether they learned a great deal relative to 
what they learned from other courses. Still, 
others may give unfavorable answers if they 
disliked a class’s professor, even if they really 
did “learn a great deal.” Some students may 
associate learning with work and mark that 
they learned a great deal even if they really 
didn’t, just because the class kept them busy. 
Because it’s the only metric of its kind reported 
on ART 2.0, it’s almost impossible to infer what 
students really meant by their answers.

Qualitative data, like students’ comments 

to written course evaluation questions, would 
serve as a far better indicator of course quality. 
Written comments and course reviews would 
provide a more complete picture of what 
students did or didn’t like about a class, and 
why. Students have different preferences and 
learn differently. A lecture style that allows 85 
percent of students to “learn a great deal” from 
a course might pose a huge barrier to learning 
for some students. That would be helpful to 
know before signing up to take the class.

The idea that qualitative information would 

be more useful for students is supported by the 
fact that — at least according to the survey I 
unscientifically conducted with 63 University 
undergraduates — students already express a 
preference for qualitative information about 
courses and professors.

Thirty-three percent of people surveyed 

responded that they are most likely to seek 
information about a class (or a class’s professor) 
from peers, older students or alumni, while 57 
percent primarily use Rate My Professors, a site 
that offers both numerical rankings and scores 
on professor quality and written reviews about 
professors and classes. Given that ART 2.0 went 
live less than two weeks before I distributed the 
survey, I did not include it as an answer choice.

Eighty-four 
percent 
of 
students 
said 

they primarily use qualitative information 
like reviews when using sites like Rate My 
Professors. Students who talk to peers, older 
students or alumni about courses are almost 
certainly going to get qualitative information 
like a friend’s description of his or her 
experience with a class or professor.

This speaks to the main concern I have 

with the new ART 2.0 site: By only providing 
quantitative data — and not student comments 
about teaching quality or course material 
— the site fails to provide students with the 
information that they find most useful to their 
decision-making process.

There are, however, certain circumstances 

under which purely quantitative data could be 
useful — for example, for students selecting 
a required class taught by several different 
professors during the same term. In this 
scenario, rankings of different sections taught 
by different professors may facilitate easier 
comparison. However, because ART 2.0 doesn’t 
provide data by professor, it’s not even possible 
to see whether more students “learned a great 
deal” in Mitchell Dudley’s or Justin Wolfers’ 
section of Econ 101.

I understand that professors would be 

hesitant to support a website that makes it 
clear that, of all the professors who have 
taught sections of a class in the past five years, 
their students ranked them the lowest. But 
professors can’t prevent students from making 
enrollment decisions based on professors’ 
reputations among students. Given that many 
students will be able to find information about 
instructor quality by talking to older students or 
clicking through Rate My Professors, it seems 
that preventing students from accessing course 
evaluation data on teacher performance only 
lessens the chance that students’ enrollment 
decisions will be based on a representative 
sample of student opinion.

By 
incorporating 
more 
qualitative 

information 
and 
aggregating 
more 

information than exists through current 
sources, ART 2.0 could prove incredibly 
useful to students. The University has 
indicated that the user feedback is likely to 
shape future iterations of the site. I’ve used 
the site, and the main suggestion I have for 
its developers is simple: Provide students 
with the information most likely to help them 
make the best course decisions possible.

Besides, wasn’t that supposed to be their 

goal in the first place?

EVENT PREVIEW
Xu Weixin paints a 
real portrait of China

By MERIN MCDIVITT

Daily Arts Writer

Many a Chinese artist has 

painted a portrait of Chairman 
Mao, the country’s leader dur-
ing 
and 

after 
the 

Communist 
Revolution. 
His 
like-

ness, which 
adorns 
buildings, 
Tiananmen 
Square and 
an 
enor-

mous 
gold 

statue, even 
inspired an Andy Warhol por-
trait still on display at the Detroit 
Institute of Arts.

But contemporary painter Xu 

Weixin’s take on the famous lead-
er is a little different. Viewed on 
its own, his portrait of Mao looks 
similar to more conventional 
depictions — painted on a grand 
scale, the monumental portrait 
seems to reflect Mao’s stature in 
Chinese society, accompanied by 
a small plaque with a brief biogra-
phy of his life. But in the context 
of Weixin’s exhibition “Monu-
mental Portraits,” his American 
debut, the Mao painting takes on 
a greater significance.

Next to Mao’s portrait is 

another portrait, identical in size 
and style, depicting a young boy. 
As you turn away from the wall 
and scan the gallery, you take 
in dozens of these paintings, all 
the same larger-than-life size, 

portraits of miners and school-
teachers, politicians and busi-
nesspeople. The paintings come 
from one series in which Weixin 
painted contemporary Chinese 
miners, and another in which he 
depicted figures from the 1966 
Cultural Revolution in China 
based on old photographs.

There is something immensely 

powerful about standing in the 
gallery, surrounded by faces and 
figures, many unknown or mar-
ginal even in China, on such a 
monumental scale. Weixin paints 
in a realist style infused with 
pathos, his muted color palette 
reflecting the melancholy air of 
many of his subjects. Taken on 
their own, unaccompanied by the 
text on or beside each painting, 
they remind me of Dennis Hop-
per’s work — the loneliness of 
humanity etched in each line on 
the faces of the solitary figures. 
Weixin has a real gift for captur-
ing the nuance of facial expres-
sion, and I often recognized 
myself or someone I know in the 
mischievous sparkle in a child’s 
face or the worn-out frustration 
of an overworked bureaucrat.

But the text, as in Mao’s por-

trait, provides a short and dispas-
sionate biography of the subject’s 
life which packs a huge emotion-
al punch. These figures, seem-
ingly anonymous and distant, 
are revealed to be as enormously, 
overwhelmingly human as their 
oversized visages. Weixin chose 
to paint figures from all facets of 
the Cultural Revolution, which 
remains the most contentious 

period in modern Chinese his-
tory.

The 1960s saw a change in gov-

ernment policy and grassroots 
actions which sought to purify 
the country of any remaining 
non-Communist, 
pre-modern 

influences. Weixin paints top 
party leaders like Chairman Mao 
and his wife, Jiang Qing, but also 
supposed “nobodies,” from emi-
grants who left China to victims 
who died during the era’s politi-
cal purges. Many landholders, 
intellectuals and political dissi-
dents died during the time peri-
od at the hand of the Red Guard, 
teens and college students who 
wanted to cleanse China of dis-
sent.

Weixin doesn’t leave any 

of these stories out. He paints 
victims, like a Peking Univer-
sity professor who was beaten 
to death by her own female stu-
dents, or a fifth grade girl who 
was “re-educated” after she 
wrote a letter asking the govern-
ment to put an end to the vio-
lence. And he paints Red Guard 
leaders, telling their stories of 
youthful optimism that fueled 
periods of militant violence, but 
also of times of hard labor and 
incredible 
achievement. 
The 

United States doesn’t have a par-
ticularly nuanced view of con-
temporary China, the Cultural 
Revolution or even Chinese art. 
Weixin’s diverse, multifaceted 
portrait of his country’s history 
is a poignant reminder of the 
complexity of the human experi-
ence.

McCarthy is 

talented but needs 

better movies.

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

Melissa McCarthy (“Spy”) is 

hilarious, but sadly, most of her 
movies aren’t. In “The Boss,” she 
once again 
stars as an 
over-the-
top char-
acter on 
a journey 
filled with 
poor humor 
and no pur-
pose.

This time, she’s the boss — For-

tune 500 CEO Michelle Darnell. 
She looks ridiculous, always 
wearing turtlenecks and a gin-
ger haircut that says “I want to 
speak to your manager.” But don’t 
be fooled: Michelle has built an 
empire through sheer strength 
of will, and swears like a sailor to 
boot. It’s very jarring when she 
does so around children. Though 
a tragic backstory is presented to 
explain her difficult nature (she 
kept being returned to an orphan-
age as a child), it’s not enough to 
make her wild personality feel 
plausible. She doesn’t back down 
to anyone. Her ex-boyfriend 
Renault (Peter Dinklage, “Game 
of Thrones”) brings Michelle’s 
world crashing down when he 
exposes her illegal insider trad-
ing. After a short amount of time 
in a comfortable jail, Michelle 
looks for someone to help her get 
back on her feet.

At this point, I wondered if 

“The Boss” was aiming to satirize 
certain influential rich people 
whose egocentric ruthlessness 

propelled them to such highs 
and lows in their careers. The 
film’s faithful focus on Michelle, 
at times treated like an antihero, 
makes it impossible to tell. Is this 
a cause of bad character devel-
opment, or an over-reliance on 
cheap humor? Who knows.

Not surprisingly, no one helps 

Michelle until her kind assistant 
Claire (Kristen Bell, “Veronica 
Mars”) takes her in. Michelle is as 
rude and unappreciative as ever, 
complaining that the accommo-
dations do not meet her five-star 
hotel standards. The fact that 
Claire is a single mother does not 
interest the washed up boss until 
she invites her ex-employer to 
her daughter’s Dandelions (read: 
Girl Scout) meetings. Once there, 
Michelle finds her passion of 
business again. She tries to start 
a new venture by selling Claire’s 
homemade brownies through 
the Dandelions, and aggressively 
directs the girls to maximize 
profits.

McCarthy’s titular “Boss” 

character is, in general, unlike-
able. That’s the joke, but it’s not 
funny after being repeated for 
nearly two hours straight. In a 
similar vein, some of the jokes 
are just plain mean-spirited. One 
that particularly rubbed me the 
wrong way (and is featured in 
the trailer to attract viewers) is 
when the Boss introduces Claire 
as her partner at the first Dande-
lions meeting, and then cries “no 
homo.” “No girl-on-girl action,” 
she insists. When a wide-eyed girl 
asks what she means, she answers 
that it’s “something you’ll dabble 
in in college and never do again” 
(She then points to another Dan-
delion girl for whom lesbianism 
will fit “like a glove”). I know 
Melissa McCarthy is not homo-
phobic and is trying to show 
what an uncompassionate person 

Michelle is. Hell, she crashed a 
huge lesbian party in the simi-
larly ridiculous “Tammy” just to 
say how much she admired lesbi-
ans’ strength. But such derisive 
comments stuck with me as both 
North Carolina and Mississippi 
pass anti-LGBT legislation. It also 
hit too close to home, as about 
25 percent of my own Girl Scout 
troop was queer (and proud of the 
organization’s tolerant policies).

This is the second collabora-

tion between McCarthy and her 
husband, the first being the afore-
mentioned “Tammy”. That was 
a red flag before I even started 
watching. Director Ben Falcone 
does not do much directing. His 
shots and scene transitions aren’t 
strong or attentive to detail, let 
alone interesting. And he cer-
tainly doesn’t inspire the cast to 
match the comedic prowess of 
his wife.

The husband-and-wife team 

also wrote the script together, 
to poor results (again). The plot 
is poorly developed. Each scene 
feels like a separate gag about the 
same horribly unlikable woman. 
The characters stubbornly stay 
the same even as they interact 
with strikingly different person-
alities. Why does Claire bother 
to help such a nasty woman after 
working for her for only a short 
period of time? Only McCarthy 
makes this film palatable. And 
the premise of Michelle making 
a comeback after a high-profile 
crime through Girl Scout cookies 
isn’t sound in the first place.

Melissa McCarthy deserves 

much better than this. She is a 
talented comic actress, as dem-
onstrated in “Bridesmaids” and 
“Spy”. But until she lands in 
better movies where she plays 
a genuine human and not a car-
toon character, her talent will be 
wasted in such silly roles.

Ramakers lectures 
on artistic passion

By ERIKA SHEVCHEK

Daily Arts Writer

Amsterdam 
native 
Renny 

Ramakers made her first visit to 
Michigan Thursday as a Penny 
Stamps distinguished speaker. 
The co-founder of the design 
company Droog, meaning “dry” 
in Dutch, Ramakers presented 
her business’s work to the peo-
ple of Ann Arbor. However, her 
designs were the complete oppo-
site of “dry.”

Eclectic and energetic, Ramak-

ers creates functional pieces of 
art and open design spaces for 
others to access.

“Droog is a paradox,” Ramak-

ers said during her presentation. 
“It’s taking what is simple and 
making it not so simple.”

Whether you’re a tea-drink-

ing human or even a tiny gold-
fish, Droog considers all beings. 
Projects like House of Droog, a 
modern Amsterdam exhibit that 
flips the ideas of a hotel or Stu-
dio Droog, the birthplace for the 
adornments, products and fur-
nishings created by Droog design-
ers (including a restaurant design 
for a fish tank) all carry the same 
theme: “function and fiction.”

“It is out of the box and playful, 

but very serious,” Ramakers said 
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily.

With a strong focus in contem-

porary design, she presented on 
many of her impressive projects 
through the years, such as the 
New York-based Museum of Sex’s 
exhibit “Splendor in the Grass,” 
a 
camping-themed, 
hands-on 

experience that educates patrons 
on eroticism and sexuality. 

Starting up in 1993, Ramak-

ers’s “Droog” created the plat-
form for further projects like 
“The New Original” in Shenzhen, 
China and “Open House” in the 
suburbs of New York City. With 
inspiration from the common 
people and an urge for a domes-
tic change, Ramakers found the 
perfect project that she titled 
“Design+Desires”.

Design+Designers, Ramakers 

said, was about depth.

“How can we (the design team) 

create a city in which the diver-
sity of desires could be brought 
together?” she asked.

The company started their 

efforts in the impoverished city of 
Rotterdam, Amsterdam, in which 
they hoped to improve living 
standards artistically.

“People over there sent us 

away … They didn’t believe we 
could be any meaning for them,” 
Ramakers said.

Nonetheless, Ramakers and 

her team were determined to 
start up a social and urban proj-
ect, thus leading to Social City — 
an online space in which people 

can create avatars, shape their 
living situations and share their 
dreams and wants for their per-
fect lifestyle. With more ideas 
and people on board, Social City 
hopes to transform these dreams 
into a reality.

“I wanted to bring people’s 

desires into Social City,” Ramak-
ers said. “Some don’t have the 
imagination to think further than 
things around them. So, we as 
designers need to be creative, go 
further and be innovative.”

When asked where she got her 

inspirations, Ramakers said she 
didn’t know.

“Everything can inspire me,” 

she said. “An article, a product, a 
movement, something.” But she 
also believes that “imitation can 
be inspiration” and she hopes that 
people are also getting inspired 
by Droog projects. These inspi-
rations were evident to the audi-
ence when Ramakers displayed 
her vibrant and eccentric designs 
on the screen.

“I want people to understand 

why I am doing what I am doing 
… celebrating imperfection,” she 
said.

And 
although 
Droog 
and 

Design+Desires feels like an 
idea beyond imagination, Renny 
Ramakers proved that with resil-
ience and passion, any exotic 
design can be brought to be a real-
life function.

I

n September of 2015, com-
edy queen Amy Schumer 
(“Inside Amy Schumer”) 

sold a memoir to publishing 
house Simon & Schuester for 
8 to 10 mil-
lion dollars. 
She’s in 
good com-
pany — in 
the past 
few years, 
comedians 
have been 
flocking to 
literature 
from televi-
sion.

It started, as it always 

seems to for me, with Tina 
Fey (“Sisters”). The year 
was 2011, and the television 
show “30 Rock” was teaching 
me everything I needed to 
know about insults, gender, 
mentor-mentee relationships 
and Ronald Regan. And 
then I heard about Fey’s 
memoir “Bossypants.” I got it 
immediately. I read it roughly 
twelve times before I got the 
CD audiobook. I listened to 
it every night before bed for 
months, often falling asleep 
to Fey teaching me about the 
patriarchy and telling me to 
“do your thing and don’t care if 
they like it.”

Fey’s twenty year long career 

in comedy permeates every 
page of “Bossypants.” The 
skillfully written vignettes, 
which range from detailing 
her awkward childhood to the 
success of her professional 
life, are composed with the 
same carefully planned, taut, 
comic dexterity of an episode 
of “30 Rock.” The ensemble 
cast of “30 Rock” averaged 
over 100 verbal jokes for every 
twenty-two minute episode and 
“Bossypants” achieves similar 
wit, with interconnected 
callbacks, reveals and cultural 
references spanning all 
chapters of the memoir.

In the same vein came 

“Is Everyone Hanging Out 
with Me?.” The memoir, by 
Mindy Kaling (“The Mindy 
Project”), so closely resembles 
Fey’s that she calls herself 

out on it within the first few 
pages. “Why isn’t this book 
more like Tina Fey’s book?” 
asks an imaginary reader. 
To which Kaling responds “I 
know, man. Tina’s awesome.” 
Kaling, whose book the press 
dubbed ‘the little sister to 
Bossypants’ writes less like Fey 
and more like the content to 
which her millennial readers 
are accustomed. There’s a 
blog-esque feel to the short 
chapters, with a few listicles 
masquerading as chapters 
— she calls them ‘pliests,’ a 
contraction meaning “a piece 
with a list-y quality.” Kaling 
persistently hurls jokes at her 
readers, sticking to what she 
knows; the virtues of cheap 
Forever 21 coats when pulling 
an Irish good-bye at a party, 
the perils of dating and the 
occasional name drop that cues 
a collective reader swoon.

After “Bossypants” and 

“Everyone” came out, they 
were everywhere, at least 
among my friends from home, 
self-identified fellow feminists 
and book-lovers. I couldn’t 
walk into a bedroom without 
seeing at least one of the 
distinct covers — Fey’s has her 
face iconically photoshopped 
onto the torso of a furry man in 
a tie, while Kaling surrounds 
herself with pink and florals 
to complement her side eye. 
This ubiquity makes sense 
when you consider that Fey 
sold almost four million copies 
of “Bossypants” and Kaling 
stayed on the New York Times 
Bestseller List for months with 
“Everyone.”

The memoir cycle 

continued with “Yes Please” 
by Amy Poehler (“Parks and 
Recreation”). Poehler’s memoir, 
especially when compared to 
those of other writers, feels 
forced, which she recognizes 
fully — in the preface, she 
acknowledges that she “had no 
business agreeing to write this 
book … it has been like hacking 
away at a freezer with a 
screwdriver.” We get it, Poehler 
is a busy lady. With two sons, 
a prolific film and television 
career and her extensive 

philanthropic work, she has 
other things on her mind. But 
there’s a lot of filler and not 
nearly enough substance in the 
memoir, which pains me to say. 
Poehler is a hugely talented 
and intelligent woman, but 
literature isn’t her medium.

Everyone I think of who 

has written a memoir like 
this is a phenomenal TV actor 
(Poehler, Fey, Aziz Ansari) and 
even though it’s not always 
the right fit, every one of 
them is so successful. These 
books are popular because 
they’re easy, in every aspect — 
sentence structure, ideas, jokes. 
They don’t make us labor for 
meaning or substance. When 
they work, they’re relatable 
and fun. When they don’t, it’s 
forgivable because these aren’t 
authors we want to harshly 
judge; they’re fan favorites we 
want to cheer on.

We’re also willing to forgive 

mediocre writing because 
this isn’t the principal work 
of any of these authors. Yes, 
Aziz Ansari spent years 
interviewing people and 
researching the cultures of 
different cultures for “Modern 
Romance,” but if you ask almost 
anyone what he’s been up to in 
the last year and half, they’ll 
most likely say “Master of 
None.” The transitory state of 
medium for these comedians 
means that these books will all 
be listed under “other work” for 
their Wikipedia pages. They’re 
thought of as side projects.

That’s a mistake. Speaking 

from the perspective of 
an English major, literary 
columnist and passer of ECON 
101, comedian memoirs have 
huge potential. The huge 
compensations for these 
memoirs, including Schumer’s 
and Lena Dunham’s 3.5 million 
dollars for her hilarious and 
confessional “Not That Kind 
of Girl,” prove that though the 
content of these memoirs may 
be funny, that doesn’t mean we 
shouldn’t take them seriously.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

There are a lot of things 

that make me sad. When my 
avocados turn brown before 
I have time to eat them. The 
2000 film “Rugrats in Paris: 
The 
Movie.” 
The fact 
that Huma 
Abedin is 
married to 
Anthony 
“Carlos 
Danger” 
Weiner.

What 

makes me 
saddest 
though, is the answer my mom 
gave to a question I asked her a 
few weeks ago. In anticipation 
of this, my final column as the 
Gender and Media Columnist 
for The Michigan Daily, I asked 
people in my life what in pop 
culture gives them hope for 
the future of feminism. Her 
answer?

“Nothing.”
In some ways, she’s not 

wrong. We have a woman 
running for president being 
attacked left and right because 
of her “ambition.” Of the top 
250 highest-grossing films 
that have been released in the 
past two years, only 9 percent 
were directed by women. Last 
week, Donald Trump said that 
women who had undergone 
abortion procedures should 
be punished. Olivia Wilde was 
considered “too old” (she’s 32!) 
to play Leonardo Dicaprio’s 
wife in “Wolf of Wall Street.” 

My mom may be cynical, but 

she has a point: it’s still hard 
out there for us ladies. But even 
though there’s a lot to bemoan 
about the status of women in 
American society, I am more 
interested in the small, bright 
sparks guiding us to the light at 
the end of the tunnel. Because 
despite the obvious uphill 
battle towards equality and 
equity ahead of us, I do find 
hope for women.

I find hope in the complex, 

fully-charged, dynamic 
female characters peppering 
television; from Alicia Florrick 
on “The Good Wife” to “Mad 
Men” ’s Peggy Olsen to Sarah 
Paulson’s intensely humanizing 

take on Marcia Clark in “The 
People vs. OJ Simpson.”

Despite the murky muck 

that is the current political 
landscape, I find hope that 
we do have a woman running 
for president, even if her 
run is breathtakingly more 
difficult than those of the 
men around her. At least she 
has the chutzpah to fight on. I 
find hope in the fact that our 
maple-syrup sweet neighbor 
to the North is led by a man 
who insists he won’t stop 
calling himself a feminist, and 
who urges other men to say 
the same. (I also find hope in 
the fact that men like Justin 
Trudeau even exist, let alone 
run a country — have you seen 
the gentle, Paul Rudd eyes on 
that man?)

I find hope in artists like 

Lady Gaga and Hozier, who 
bravely use their platforms 
to speak out against sexual 
assault in personal and 
powerful terms. Gaga’s Oscars 
performance, in which she 
surrounded herself with 
survivors of sexual assault, was 
a urgent reminder to the world 
that this epidemic has faces 
and names, and stories to go 
along with it. It gives me hope 
that this charged performance 
was introduced by the Vice 
President of the United 
States, a man whose complex 
relationship with women’s 
issues may be changing for the 
better.

I find hope in “Star Wars,” 

which I saw in theaters three 
times, mesmerized by the 
woman unapologetically at 
the forefront of the film. Rey 
is unlike any woman in the 
sci-fi genre: obviously strong 
and scrappy, but also emotive 
and joyful. Sensitive but brave, 
smart but not faultless. Never 
sexualized. Daisy Ridley’s Rey 
proves that movies are better, 
and can even make more 
money, when they don’t resort 
to limiting stereotypes and 
ways of silencing women.

“Broad City” gives me 

hope for the power of female 
friendship, and for greater 
recognition of the tender 
impact women can have on 
each other’s lives. Abbi and 
Ilana’s relationship is one of 
the strongest on television, and 
the lack of a man in that dyad 
cannot be ignored. Rebecca 
Traister’s book “All the Single 
Ladies,” which lays out the 
positive political and social 
implications of a society in 
which women delay, or even 
opt out of marriage, gives me 
similar hope.

Just as I’m hopeful about the 

world out there, the world of 
real jobs and scary choices and 
adult implications, I’m grateful 
for the world in here, the small 
spaces filled with stunningly 
smart, kind and empowering 
people in which I’ve been lucky 
to spend my life. So many other 
people contributed to this list, 
others that too, give me hope.

My teachers and mentors, 

who showed me how to write 
and then let me break the rules 
when I wanted to. Professors 
who taught me the nuances 
of feminism and gave me 
the space to babble in their 
classroom. Others still that 
let me teach them, who gave 
me respect when I told them 
I thought they were wrong. 
Hope comes from the women 
who came before me, who had 
it so much harder in their battle 
against the patriarchy. Even as 
I sat here and wrote this, two 
Daily alums in their sixties 
walked into the newsroom to 
hand out fliers about National 
Equal Pay Day. They came 
up to me and asked if I know 
women still get paid 25 percent 
less than men. I can’t help but 
smile, grateful that women like 
them are still fighting after so 
many years.

Hope comes from my 

Daily co-workers, who sang 

JoJo with me and bought me 
cupcakes on my birthday and 
even now comfort me as I 
stand, paralyzed, at the edge 
of college. They were the ones 
who let me begin this column, 
who gave me constant fodder 
for ideas and who made me 
feel like I could do it. They lit 
the small fire in my head, the 
thought that I might actually 
be good at this.

My friends, smart and savvy 

almost-graduates, who poured 
in new perspectives and ideas, 
showing me how potent women 
can be when they support 
each other. They were there 
for me in these last moments 
as they have been from the 
beginning, letting me rant 
about something long enough 
that it finally coalesced into 
an idea for a column, bringing 
me coffee and snacks when 
needed (and when not), and 
giving me the strength to write 
about things that are personal, 
to write about things that 
frightened me. Knowing that 
women and men like them are 
entering the world, with the 
power to make change both 
micro and macro, gives me 
hope. Knowing that they will 
always be with me gives me 
more.

I wrote about my dad in my 

very first column, using him as 
a scapegoat for unenlightened 
men everywhere. I’m lucky 
that he let me make him that 
scapegoat, that his support 
included letting me throw 
him under the bus. He is never 
stingy with his pride in me, 
even when I’m railing against 
the entirety of his gender. That 
kind of support is more than 
rare, and I think it has buoyed 
me more than I’ve given him 
credit for.

When I asked my mom that 

original question about her 
hopes for feminism, and she 
gave her original answer, I 
laughed. That kind of sharp, 
intellectual cynicism would 
make sense for a woman who 
has been defying the status quo 
her entire life. The obstacles 
she has had to overcome in 
order to be the woman she 
is have allowed me to be 
optimistic in a way she can’t be. 
But she always surprises me, 
and she soon sent a barrage of 
texts about her hopes, giving 
me new ideas and avenues to 
pursue. All that I am — a pop 
culture obsessive, a planner, a 
businessperson, a good friend, 
a dreamer, a feminist — I am 
because of her. Mom, thanks 
for letting me pretend for even 
a second that I achieved any of 
those identities on my own. It’s 
all because of you.

Last Saturday, before going 

to Rick’s with my roommates 
to revel in our final weeks in 
Ann Arbor, I hid in my room 
and watched “Sisterhood of 
the Traveling Pants.” I had 
always identified as a Carmen, 
resonating with her pluck 
and her anger, her insistence 
that people care about her as 
deeply as she cares about them. 
Watching it again ten years 
after it first captivated me, I 
began to weep. How much my 
life has changed since I was 
a fifth grader, dreaming of 
meeting a Kostos on a Greek 
island and road tripping with 
my best friends who knew me 
better than I knew myself. How 
powerful it is, that a movie 
about four young girls, a movie 
that emphasizes friendship, 
came out when I was ten and 
just beginning to understand 
the prices and joys of being a 
girl. How powerful too that 
last year, when my best friend 
and I flew across the Atlantic 
Ocean to traverse Europe, on 
a whim I carried a copy of the 
“Sisterhood” book with me.

That’s what gives me hope 

as I move across the country, 
away from my family and 
friends. Yes, we’ll talk every 
day and visit one another 
and develop new memories, 
but it will be their years of 
support and empowerment that 
strengthen me — as a friend, a 
student, a sister, a daughter and 
as a feminist. I’ll carry them 
with me, like a well-worn book.

GENDER & MEDIA COLUMN

Lame ‘Twenty88’

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Big Sean and Jhene Aiko live 

in the shadows. I don’t mean that 
in a positive, atmospheric sort 
of way. Aiko 
is 
undoubt-

edly 
best 

known 
for 

her features 
— 
either 

for 
quality, 

like Drake’s 
“From 
Time,” or for 
topical gim-
micks, 
like 

Omarion’s “Post To Be” (“he gotta 
eat the booty like groceries”). 
Sean, on the other hand, seems to 
thrive on the fringes of his own 
projects, his biggest moments 
arriving as tag-alongs to more 
prominent artists, like “Bless-
ings,” which buzzed thanks to 
Drake and Kanye, and “Control,” 
which is memorable only for Ken-
drick. Sean and Aiko have a habit 
of appearing like decorative bows 
on the successes of others, color-
ful, if non-essential. 

With both artists inhabiting 

similar spaces, it makes sense 
that Aiko and Sean have shown 
chemistry 
before. 
“Beware” 

from Sean’s Hall of Fame, was a 
momentary highlight from the 
two, a side by side love-lament as 
they do best. But the two have less 
in common as artists than meets 

the eye, and TWENTY88, their 
joint project, finds the two real-
izing this deficit.

This helps explain the sole 

focus of this project: the romantic 
life of twenty-somethings. There 
seems to be little else the two can 
find common ground on, and thus 
they settle on cultivating a pre-
tend, media-tailored relationship, 
reminiscent of the fake marriage 
between Drake and Nicki Minaj. 
It’s reality television meets the 
music industry. Tabloid-pushing 
aside, there are moments when 
the chemistry works nonethe-
less. Opening track “Déjà Vu” 
sees Aiko and Sean playing into 
each other’s strengths, Aiko’s 
no-games mentality (“Tonight 
you gon’ learn / it’s your turn”) 
balancing 
Sean’s 
playful-to-a-

fault worldview (“No but for real, 
how’s ya sister / Hit her up, tell 
her I miss her”). While “Beware” 
kept their voices on separate 
planes, they melt into one another 
here, sharing the spotlight.

But that interplay begins to feel 

tired as the project progresses, 
teetering on dull. There’s only so 
much they both have to say, no 
matter how much surface-level 
innovation they attempt to bring. 
Take “Talk Show,” for example, 
where Aiko and Sean act as a 
couple appearing on a televi-
sion talk show, arguing back and 
forth. The concept is interesting 
on paper, and is unique enough to 
break up the monotony the album 

falls into. After a single listen, 
though, there’s little to come back 
to, its new toy shine worn out.

Any hope that these artists 

would push each other to new 
heights now seems ill-conceived. 
Aiko is at her best on airy, impres-
sionist tracks, her voice occa-
sionally bringing a lingering, 
ethereal quality, as on “Wth” and 
“The Worst.” That atmosphere 
is never even attempted here, as 
she grounds herself to equate 
her voice with Sean’s. For Sean’s 
part, this joint project feels like 
a reach toward R&B. He leaves 
behind his base of almost joke 
rap, which produced some of his 
best works (“Paradise”), bring-
ing along the lyrical clunkers, but 
too often without the confident 
flow to accompany. On “Selfish,” 
he half-sings “You know I’m 
from a tribe called questions / I 
need them answers now like it’s 
test time.” It’s lazily constructed 
and awkward, indicative of the 
level of rapping Sean reaches on 
TWENTY88.

The sum is a frustratingly 

reductive album, a result found 
far too often when major artists 
collaborate on joint albums. Ide-
ally this should work: “Let’s take 
two famous artists, throw them 
together and figure something 
great will happen!” But the com-
promises in style that must be 
made can be too great to tran-
scend. TWENTY88 falls into this 
trap.

Throwers fuel ‘M’

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

The field events have led the 

Michigan 
men’s 
track 
team 

recently, 
with 
the 
throwers 

especially finding success. This 
past weekend was no different, 
as the Wolverines traveled to 
Auburn, Ala., to compete in the 
Tiger Track Classic.

Junior 
thrower 
Grant 

Cartwright continued to shine in 
the field events by setting a new 
personal record in the shot put 
with a throw of 18.44 meters. The 
throw placed him in second for 
the event.

Being at the top of the 

leaderboard 
is 
something 

Cartwright has gotten used 
to since the outdoor season 
began. He suffered an injury in 
December and spent a majority 
of the indoor season trying 
to get ready for the outdoor 
season.

“As we’ve moved outdoors, he’s 

been able to train a lot differently,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jerry 

Clayton. “We had to cut some 
things out to get (Cartwright’s 
injury) calmed down. So now he’s 
back into training and getting 
really consistent, which is what 
we’re looking for this time of 
year.”

Not 
to 
be 
outdone 
by 

Cartwright’s 
success, 
senior 

decathlete 
Steven 
Bastien 

separated from the rest of his 
team to compete in the Bulldog 
Decathlon/Heptathlon meet in 
Athens, Ga., on Thursday. Not 
only did Bastien finish in the top 
10, but he also set a school record 
in the decathlon and posted the 
ninth-best national score in the 
event this year.

The 
meet 
marked 
the 

first time Bastien had ever 
competed in the decathlon for 
the Wolverines. However, the 
senior has been training for the 
event for a while.

“Coach Clayton has had it all 

planned out pretty well,” Bastien 
said. “I think it’s been planned out 
since the beginning of the season, 
even. We just throw a little bit 
every week. We do jumping and 
pole vaulting every week. I run 
two times a week, one day a (400-
meter) workout and the other 
day is more of a (1,000-meter) or 
(1,500-meter) workout.

“I 
guess 
the 
training 
is 

designed to make it so you keep in 
touch with each of the events and 
are able to build on things you’ve 
worked on in prior weeks.”

In addition to Clayton’s help 

in preparing for the decathlon, 
Bastien could also turn to his 
previous coach. His father, Gary 
Bastien, not only coached Steven, 
but also ran the decathlon in 
college with Eastern Michigan. 
In fact, according to decathlon 
historian Frank Zarnowski, the 
father-son combined score of 
Gary and Steven is the highest 
such score of all time.

“Since I’ve gotten to Michigan, 

(my dad) has really let Coach 
Clayton do whatever and coach 
me entirely,” Bastien said. “I 
wouldn’t say he’s (like) any parent, 
because he knows so much about 
it. But his role as a coach isn’t as 
much as it used to be.”

Despite the success of Bastien 

and Cartwright, the team still 
has work to do before it reaches 
the 
postseason 
tournaments. 

According to Clayton, though, 
this weekend was a step in the 
right direction.

“What we did in the first two 

(outdoor) 
meets, 
those 
were 

scoring situations very similar to 
what you get at the conference 
meet, the preliminary rounds 
and the NCAA Championships,” 
Clayton said.

Though the team can revel in 

the building success with each 
passing meet, its focus is firmly on 
the future, and more specifically, 
the end of the season.

The Michigan rowing team lost to Ohio State, but beat Rutgers at the Big Ten Double Dual in Princeton, N.J., on Saturday. 
Buckeyes dominate B1G Double Dual

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

For the past few seasons, 

Ohio State has had the Michigan 
women’s rowing team’s number. 
Saturday, that trend continued.

“Ohio State is the defending 

national champs and is a really 
good program,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rothstein. “They got 
the better of us.”

Competing at the Big Ten 

Double Dual in Princeton, N.J., 
which featured the sixth-ranked 
Wolverines, Michigan State, No. 3 
Ohio State and Rutgers, Michigan 
rowed against the Buckeyes in 
the morning before matching up 
against the Scarlet Knights in the 
afternoon.

In the morning meet, the 

highlight for Michigan was the 
second varsity eight race. The 

boat narrowly won the race over 
Ohio State, finishing with a time 
of 6:49.6.

The rest of the meet, though, 

was all Buckeyes.

Ohio State’s first varsity eight 

handily beat Michigan, defeating 
the Wolverines by a full eight 
seconds with a winning time of 
6:34.8. The Michigan first and 
second varsity fours also both 
lost to their respective Buckeye 
counterparts. While the first 
varsity four narrowly lost by under 
two seconds, the second varsity 
four was not as competitive, losing 
by almost six seconds.

“I was pleased with our second 

eight beating Ohio State, and I 
thought our first eight learned 
some things in the morning and 
did better in the afternoon,” 
Rothstein said. “I thought our 
first four, even though they 

came up short, raced well in the 
morning against Ohio State. It 
was a good day, good learning 
experience.”

In the afternoon — with 

strong winds slowing all four 
teams — the Wolverines had a 
much better showing. In the first 
varsity eight, Michigan trounced 
Rutgers, finishing with a time of 
7.14.5 for a 40.2-second margin 
of victory. The second varsity 
eight was even more dominant, 
jousting the Scarlet Knights by 
44.1 seconds with a winning time 
of 7:27.6.

Both of the Wolverines’ varsity 

fours were stellar in the afternoon 
as well, defeating Rutgers by huge 
margins. The first varsity four 
won by almost a minute — 8:29.1 to 
9:23.6 — while the second varsity 
four won by just 50 seconds, 
8:03.56 to 8:54.3.

While 
the 
higher-ranked 

Buckeyes tripped up Michigan, 
Rothstein was happy to be able 
to compete against another good 
team, especially with both the Big 
Ten and NCAA Championships 
quickly approaching.

“We need to evaluate what we 

did well and areas that we need 
to shore up,” Rothstein said. “I 
think the biggest thing is just to 
practice really hard over the next 
week. We’ll see some fast teams 
in Clemson (next weekend), so 
we’re excited to go down there, 
and it should be really good 
racing.”

Though Rothstein is optimistic 

for the future, he is still careful 
about getting his hopes up for the 
end of the season.

“It’s 
a 
fast 
conference,” 

Rothstein said. “We’ll see how we 
perform.”

Two years in, players love Leonardi

By TYLER SCOTT 

Daily Sports Writer

When Marcelo Leonardi was 

hired as the Michigan water polo 
coach, he didn’t expect to reach 
this point in less than two years.

Saturday 
at 
Canham 

Natatorium, the eighth-ranked 
Wolverines 
entered 
their 

contests ranked ahead of their 
conference foes, No. 13 Harvard 
and No. 16 Princeton, and went 
on to beat them in back-to-
back games. But before all that, 
Michigan wrapped up the last 
home invitational of the year 
with a short ceremony to honor 
the team’s graduating seniors.

Before the game against the 

Crimson, senior attackers Ali 
Thomason and Emily Martin, 
utility player Emily Sejna and 
goalie Julia Campbell stood on 
the edge of the pool deck, draped 
in bouquets and surrounded by 
balloons. Leonardi gave a short, 
emotional speech in front of a 
crowd several hundred strong. 
He thanked his seniors for doing 
the work of “rebuilding the 
program,” but paused when his 
voice shook.

“I’m proud of you all,” he said.
Thomason followed up by 

scoring four goals in the ensuing 
match. Martin added three and 
Campbell made critical saves 
late in the game that secured 
Michigan’s victory. The seniors 
showcased the type of play 
indicative of a team sitting at the 
No. 8 spot in the national polls. 

The Wolverines seem to have 

worked through any transitional 
period since Leonardi’s hire, and 
found success in the process. 
They have more wins this year 
than either of the past two 
seasons, with a week of regular-
season play still on the schedule, 
not 
to 
mention 
postseason 

tournaments.

“My past few years here have 

been rough,” Martin said. “We 
haven’t really done the best. This 
year, we’re really performing. 
We’re a great team.”

Martin and the three other 

graduating 
seniors 
were 

originally part of a 13-member 
freshman class. After Michigan 
appointed 
Leonardi, 
several 

players transferred. Campbell, 
Sejna, Martin and Thomason 
were the ones who stayed.

Saturday was the first time 

Michigan has been able to beat 
Princeton in four years, including 
a 9-7 loss late last season. The 
Wolverines have also failed to 
reach the NCAA Tournament 
every year since 2009.

Leonardi installed a system 

that was entirely different from 
what his four seniors — just 
sophomores at the time — were 
accustomed to. He immediately 
reworked the schedule to give the 
Wolverines tougher competition 
for future seasons, even though it 
meant Michigan would only host 
one home contest that first year.

But 
Leonardi 
didn’t 
stop 

with the schedule. He changed 
everything 
for 
his 
players 

across the board — from how 
they practice to how they eat 
— standard protocol for an 
incoming coach. But Leonardi’s 
changes brought results in his 
second year — results that have 

led to more wins in the record 
book and more satisfaction to the 
minds of his players.

“We have a base of culture,” 

Thomason 
said. 
“We 
know 

everyone’s working hard, and 
everyone has put in the work this 
year.

“He’s only been our coach 

for two years, but all four of us 
(seniors) have formed this bond 
with him. He took us under his 
wing and helped this program 
transform into something that 
the four of us envisioned for it. 
It truly means a lot to us to see 
that our love for the game and 
love for everyone around us is 
reciprocated in how he feels.”

The 
exposure 
of 
being 

nationally ranked could give the 
Wolverines a recruiting boost, 
as long as they keep winning. 
Current senior leadership is 
already going a long way to help 
sell Leonardi’s message to the 
underclassmen.

Freshman 
attacker 
Kim 

Johnson is Michigan’s second 

leading goal-scorer with 48 so far 
this season. She chalked up five 
more goals against Princeton. 

“One of the reasons why I 

came (to Michigan) was because 
I wanted to be a part of building 
this program,” Johnson said. “I 
love being on an underdog team 
who comes back, builds up and 
surprises everybody. And I felt 
like that’s really what we’ve done, 
and I feel like we’re going to stay 
on top the rest of my time here.”

Leonardi admits that while 

he expected to be competitive 
in conference play, he didn’t 
expect to become nationally 
ranked so quickly. In the quest 
to build a winning, competitive 
program, Leonardi is ahead of 
schedule.

He credits much of that to his 

seniors.

“Those are the four that bought 

in,” Leonardi said. “(They) really 
helped me change the climate 
and the culture of the program. 
They were the first ones on the 
bus.”

Weather shortens 
tournament as ‘M’ 
finishes in seventh

By LANEY BYLER 

Daily Sports Writer

Almost four hours past the 

official start time Saturday, 
the Michigan men’s golf team 
finally received word that the 
Kepler 
Intercollegiate 
Golf 

Tournament 
in 
Columbus 

would begin.

At 
one 
point, 
it 
didn’t 

even look like there would 
be a tournament at all. The 
possibility of rain and snow 
had 
been 
threatening 
the 

competition all morning. The 
Wolverines had been hoping 
that the tournament would go 
on as it was the last regular- 
season tournament before the 
Big Ten Championships. 

And they got their wish, 

albeit without the results they 
hoped for. Michigan finished 
the two-day tournament at 
seventh place with 599 strokes. 

“Our guys knew they had to 

be ready whenever we decided 
it was time to play, and we 
didn’t know when that would be 
exactly,” said Michigan coach 
Chris Whitten. “We wanted to 
play this tournament, and at 
one point in the morning, it was 
looking like we wouldn’t play 
any golf. We were happy just to 
have an opportunity to play.”

Bad weather wasn’t the only 

setback the 16-team bracket 
faced 
this 
weekend. 
The 

original 54-hole tournament 
was reduced to 36 due to 
weather, and that reduction left 
little room for errors.

Despite the circumstances, 

sophomore 
Kyle 
Mueller 

wasn’t deterred. On day one 
of the tournament, he led the 
Wolverines with 73 strokes, 
placing him among 14 athletes 
tied for ninth after the first day.

On day two, he jumped one 

spot in the standings after 
shooting another 73. Mueller 
was the Wolverines’ biggest 

contributor, finishing with an 
overall score of 146.

Freshman 
Nick 
Carlson 

trailed closely behind Mueller 
with Michigan’s second best 
performance, tying for 23rd on 
the first day after shooting a 74. 
He mimicked this score on the 
second day, tying for 13th with 
148 strokes.

The Wolverines settled into 

the middle of the pack after the 
first day, tying for eighth with 
West Virginia with 302 team 
strokes. Additional help from 
senior Chris O’Neill and juniors 
Reed 
Hrynewich 
and 
Tom 

Swanson 
bumped 
Michigan 

to seventh place on day two, 
where the Wolverines tied Kent 
State with 599 strokes.

“The 
guys 
were 
really 

battling to make the best of 
the round they had in front 
of them,” Whitten said. “The 
conditions were so extreme this 
week. I really don’t remember 
a tournament in 10 years of 
coaching where it was this cold 
and this windy all at the same 
time.”

Hrynewich scored a 77 on the 

first day, with Swanson trailing 
two strokes behind him. They 
both improved on day two, each 
scoring 75. Hrynewich ended 
day two with a final score of 
152, and Swanson finished with 
a score of 154.

O’Neill rounded out the team, 

shooting a 78 on both days. He 
ended with a score of 154.

As the regular season draws 

to a close and the championships 
begin, this tournament gave the 
Wolverines a good idea of what 
they need to work on.

“I know that we’re going to 

have more normal weather (at 
the Big Ten Championships),” 
Whitten said. “Obviously that’s a 
more important tournament for 
us. I think we need to reset and 
get back to some fundamentals 
before the Big Ten.”

MEN’S GOLF


‘M’ ready to 
end WNIT 

streak in 2017

A

fter four seasons at the 
helm, Michigan women’s 
basketball coach Kim 

Barnes Arico 
has made 
the NCAA 
Tournament 
only once 
— her first 
season when 
she took over 
the head 
coaching job 
in the 2012-
13 season. 
However, 
over the past three seasons, the 
Wolverines have failed to make 
the Big Dance, instead settling 
for the Women’s National 
Invitational Tournament.

Now in Barnes Arico’s fifth 

season, she’ll finally have a team 
consisting solely of players she 
has recruited. And in the 2016-17 
season, Barnes Arico will have 
the right pieces to lead Michigan 
back to the NCAA Tournament 
for the first time since 2013.

Last season, the Wolverines 

had the 14th best recruiting 
class in the nation, according 
to ESPN. That class was 
highlighted by center Hallie 
Thome and guard Nicole 
Munger, who were ranked as 
the 64th and 68th best recruits 
in the country, respectively. 
Thome lived up to the hype, 
racking up the second best field 
goal percentage in the country 
while averaging 14.4 points per 
game. Munger averaged just 
under five points, but showed 
flashes of potential. Others from 
the class, such as guard Boogie 
Brozoski and Sam Trammel, 
displayed promise as well in 
their positions and will likely 
gain more playing time next 
seasons with the graduations of 
guard Madison Ristovski and 
forward Kelsey Mitchell.

This incoming recruiting 

class isn’t as highly touted as 
last season’s, but it is talented 
in its own right. The class 
includes four-star forward Kayla 
Robbins, three-stars KeAsja 
Pierce and Akienreh Johnson, 
and guard Kysre Gondrezick, 
the No. 70 recruit in the nation, 
according to ESPN’s HoopGurlz. 
Gondrezick was named 
Michigan’s Miss Basketball 
and is the first winner of the 
award to attend Michigan 
since Ristovski first came to 
Ann Arbor. Like Ristovski, 
Gondrezick could leave a lasting 
mark on the program after 
changing the state of Michigan 
high school women’s basketball 
records when she was the first 
player to ever average over 40 
points per game during her 
senior season. She even put up a 
72-point performance in the first 
round of the district playoffs.

If Gondrezick continues 

her stellar play into college, 
she could earn playing time 
alongside the Wolverines’ best 
player — rising junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty. Flaherty is 
coming off a season in which she 
garnered Honorable Mention 
All-American honors after 
averaging 22.1 points per game 

— good for 10th in Division I. 
She shows no signs of slowing 
down, hungry to get her team 
closer to a Big Ten title in her 
third season. While that goal 
may be tough with Maryland, 
Ohio State and Michigan State 
having had the Wolverines’ 
number, this upcoming season is 
Flaherty’s best shot yet at finally 
leading Michigan over the 
WNIT hump.

While the Wolverines showed 

last season that they are capable 
of stepping up to win a game if 
Flaherty has an off night, they’ll 
still need Flaherty to lead the 
way to reach their full potential. 
Thome will have a year under 
her belt, more experience and be 
stronger, helping her dominate 
the paint on both sides of the 
ball. Guard Siera Thompson 
will be a senior, looking to 
continue to be one of Michigan’s 
best perimeter shooters while 
locking down the opposing 
team’s best scorer. Players like 
rising junior Jillian Dunston, 
rising senior Danielle Williams 
and Munger should continue 
to pull down rebounds, take 
charges and step into any role to 
give the team a boost like they 
did last season when Michigan 
needed it most.

Dunston, Williams, Munger, 

Brozoski and Gondrezick will 
likely battle for the final two 
starting spots behind Flaherty, 
Thompson and Thome. No 
matter who is chosen, the 
Wolverines have depth and 
experience on the bench, which 
is needed in the scrappy Big Ten 
conference.

Michigan picked up only 

one more win this season than 
it had in the 2014-15 season, 
finishing 21-14 overall and 9-9 
in the Big Ten. However, in this 
past season, Michigan averaged 
8.7 more points (78.6) than 
the season before with a team 
that featured just two seniors 
playing consistent minutes. 
Now that the Wolverines will 
be older while still bringing 
in young talent, they’ll be in 
great position to end their 
WNIT streak after ending their 
season in the semifinal round 
of the tournament the past two 
seasons.

Fans, players and even 

Barnes Arico have preached 
a NCAA Tournament-or-
bust mentality. Falling to the 
WNIT again would be a severe 
disappointment. A deep run in 
the NCAA Tournament may 
still be a few years out, but 
simply playing in at least one 
game in the Big Dance is a step 
forward for the program. It’ll 
give Michigan more exposure in 
the women’s basketball spotlight 
while giving the returning 
players more confidence for the 
next year to make it back again.

Next year, the Wolverines 

won’t likely win the Big Ten 
title or the WNIT or hoist their 
first banner in Crisler Center. 
But Michigan is poised to 
accomplish something more that 
it can rest its laurels on, paving 
the way for the teams that will 
come after it.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Senior outfielder Olivia Richvalsky was tagged out at third base to end the Wolverines’ 1-0 loss to Nebraska on Friday.
Small mistakes hamper Wolverines

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 1 Michigan softball 

team entered its Friday game 
against Nebraska as the highest-
scoring team in the country. 
In its previous Big Ten series, 
the Wolverines swept Indiana, 
outscoring the Hoosiers, 31-9, 
driving its ascension to the top 
spot in the national rankings.

Friday, though, the Wolverines’ 

offense tallied only one extra 
base hit. They reached base just 
eight times, a far cry from their 
previous nation-leading offensive 
output. And present throughout 
the game were subtle errors 
that added up to a 1-0 loss to the 
Cornhuskers.

Trailing by one in the seventh 

inning Friday, Michigan (8-1 
Big Ten, 29-4 overall) made a 
baserunning error that cost it a 
chance to tie the game. While 
the top of the order awaited the 
chance to tie the game or take 
the lead, senior outfielder Olivia 
Richvalsky entered the game to 
pinch-run for sophomore infielder 

Aidan Falk at second base. As 
senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero — who leads the team in 
most batting statistics — stood 
in the on-deck circle, senior 
centerfielder Sierra Lawrence hit 
a ball to left field.

Richvalsky chose to tag up on 

the fly ball and found herself out at 
third thanks to a pinpoint throw 
from Cornhuskers’ left fielder 
Gina Metzler. Game over.

As well as the Wolverines have 

performed this season, their past 
series against Nebraska (6-5, 
25-14) made them appear, well, 
normal.

In its two victories, Michigan 

defeated the Cornhuskers by 
just a combined five runs. Part 
of this struggle can be attributed 
to its troubles on the basepaths 
throughout the series.

Richvalsky’s mistake proved 

to be the most costly, but she was 
not the only Wolverine to have 
a base running error. Saturday, 
sophomore outfielder Nikki Wald 
attempted to steal her first base of 
the season, but was thrown out. 
The Wolverines failed to mount 

an attack the rest of the inning and 
maintained a slim one-run lead 
until the seventh when Lawrence 
hit a two-run home run.

Michigan will focus on base 

running and communication this 
week in practice before facing 
Michigan State on Wednesday 
and a weekend home series 
against Ohio State. Lawrence 
emphasized that in order to 
perfect these techniques on the 
basepaths, players must change 
their mentality.

“(It’s) important to look up as 

you’re rounding the base, see if 
(Michigan coach Carol Hutchins) 
is gonna send you or hold you up,” 
Lawrence said. “(Hutchins) likes 
to hold you up at the last second, 
so you gotta go hard all the way 
around third and then brake if you 
need to.”

In the third game of the 

weekend 
series, 
with 
the 

Wolverines holding a 6-5 lead, 
junior third baseman Lindsey 
Montemarano walked up to the 
plate with runners on second 
and third with one out, eager 
to extend the Wolverines’ lead. 

Unfortunately 
for 
Michigan, 

another costly base running error 
doomed its rally. Montemarano 
hit a hard line drive to third 
base 
caught 
by 
Cornhusker 

MJ Knighten, who tagged out 
Lawrence, 
who 
was 
slightly 

leading off.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

came back to win in their past 
two games, the closeness of the 
final score is cause for concern. 
Hutchins said Sunday that the 
game felt similar to a postseason 
matchup.

Hutchins 
need 
not 
worry 

about her team scoring runs, as 
Michigan leads the Big Ten in 
nearly every offensive category 
and consistently gets on base. But 
the Wolverines sometimes show 
lapses in these minor yet equally 
important areas: running on the 
basepaths and tagging up.

The 
Nebraska 
series 

demonstrated 
that 
Michigan’s 

bats know the opportune time to 
come alive. Still, the Wolverines’ 
activity on the basepaths — while 
not the primary focus of the game 
— can clearly affect its result.

Michigan readying for Spartans

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

After a disappointing weekend, 

Michigan’s 
anticipation 
is 

running high to reestablish itself 
near 
the 
top 

of the Big Ten 
pecking order. 

The 

Wolverines (3-2 
Big Ten, 21-8 
overall) — who 
dropped 
out 

of the national 
rankings 
after 

this weekend’s 
two-loss 
performance 
against 
Minnesota 
— 

will head into a 
pair of midweek 
games 
against 

Michigan State 
and 
Eastern 

Michigan hoping to end their 
losing streak. 

“We’ve played at a high level 

consistently,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich last week. 
“You’re not always gonna have 
your ‘A’ game, you’re not always 
going to be 100 percent, so I think 
our guys have done a good job of 
responding to the adversity we’ve 
experienced.”

The weekend series against 

the Golden Gophers (4-1, 18-10) 
fell short of expectations as 
the Wolverines were fraught 
with unexpected adversity — 
Minnesota won both games in 
Friday’s doubleheader — and 
unexpected weather. Michigan’s 
last chance at redemption in 
the third game of the series 
was 
cancelled 
due 
to 
cold 

temperatures, and it won’t get 
another chance again this season 
against the Golden Gophers. 

The Wolverines’ first contest 

this week will be against the 
Spartans on Tuesday, but will 
count 
as 
a 
non-conference 

matchup. 
Michigan 
has 
had 

three games cancelled so far this 
season, and the rivalry game was 

scheduled just five days ago. The 
two teams will have a chance to 
compete again the last weekend 
in April in conference play. 

The last time 

the teams met 
was last season 
at 
Comerica 

Park in Detroit, 
where 
the 

Spartans took 
home 
a 
4-2 

win. 
Though 

Michigan 
leads 
in 
the 

all-time series, 
Michigan 
State has gone 8-6 against the 
Wolverines under current head 
coach Jake Boss Jr. since 2008. 

Boss’s team will host Michigan 

at McLane Baseball Stadium in 
East Lansing. The Spartans are 
currently ranked second in the 
conference in batting average (.311) 

and first in team pitching with an 
earned-run average of 2.36. 

The key Spartan that Michigan 

will have to watch for is junior 

first 
baseman 

Jordan 
Zimmerman, 
who ranks in 
the top 10 in 
the conference 
in 
batting 

average, 
slugging 
percentage, 
on-base 
percentage, 
runs, hits, total 

bases and doubles. Most notably, 
he’s ranked first in batting average 
(.437) and second with on-base 
percentage (.521).

Despite 
the 
less-than-

stellar 
hitting 
performance 

the 
Wolverines 
had 
against 

Minnesota, Michigan’s average 
 
 

of 9.9 hits per game is comparable 
to the Spartans 10.7 hits per game. 

The second matchup of the 

week will be back at Ray Fisher 
Stadium against the Eagles, who 
boast a win against Michigan 
State from last Tuesday. 

Left-hander Tyler Butzin is 

currently leading the Eagles with 
a 2.11 ERA. The freshman hasn’t 
allowed an earned run in his last 
four starts through 28 innings. 

But neither Tuesday’s nor 

Wednesday’s 
battles 
will 
irk 

the Wolverines steadfast motto: 
getting better each day. 

“We just talk about getting 

better,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“We 

talk about today. Today’s our 
opportunity. 
Everything 
in 

the future will take care of 
themselves and will only happen 
as a byproduct of attacking each 
day. That’s what we’re going to 
do.”
