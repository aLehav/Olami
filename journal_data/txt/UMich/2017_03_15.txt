All three University of Michigan 

students mentioned in this article 
requested anonymity due to concern 
for their own safety and the safety of 
their family. The country of origin of 
one of the students is also withheld 
out of the same concern.

All under the age of 5 when they 

left, memories of home remain 
vague for three University of 
Michigan students since arriving in 

the United States on now-expired 
visas. Though protected now under 
the Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals, uncertainty for the future 
under the Trump administration 
looms.

The students went without legal 

protection until former President 
Barack Obama signed the DACA 
executive action in the summer 
of 2012. While the action does not 
grant a pathway to citizenship for 
recipients — who are often referred 
to as “Dreamers” — it provides the 
ability to work and deportation 
release.

One of the requirements to 

qualify for DACA includes arrival 
in the United States before the age 
of 16. For one female LSA junior, 
though her family avoids the 
topic of their citizenship, she still 
remembers arriving in the United 
States.

“I arrived when I was four 

and a half years old from (a South 
American country),” she said. “I 
don’t remember much other than 
saying goodbye to family members 
and … arriving in Florida. We all 
left on visas. This is what makes it 
hard because it’s something that my 

parents don’t like talking about a lot, 
and so … I never know exactly how 
things are, like really are. Like how 
did we get here, what did they do to 
get here. Then again, they didn’t tell 
me until I was in seventh grade.”

It wasn’t until fifth grade, when 

he started asking questions, that 
another LSA junior learned of about 
his immigration status. His family 
arriving to Detroit from Mexico 
on a visa when he was 4 years old, 
immigration and their status did not 
become an issue until later in his life.

“Around when I was 11 or 12, 

that’s when we started having 

more and more anti-immigrant 
sentiment,” he said. “We started 
seeing it, both in politics and in life. 
Especially around the time when 
the economy started going down.”

As these students grew older, 

enrolling 
in 
college 
became 

an issue. This was before the 
University of Michigan decided to 
allow undocumented immigrants 
to qualify for in-state tuition. For 
one Rackham student who attended 
college in Oregon before 2012, 
applying to college was a challenge 
before the state of Oregon passed a 
law in 2013 to allow undocumented 
students to receive in-state tuition 
under certain conditions.

“Back then when I was going 

to college, there was no in-state 
tuition policy, so the only schools 
that I could apply and even be 
granted in were private schools,” 
she said. “On paper, I was a really 
good student and I was a qualified 
person to go to college, but given 
my status, I applied to 15 schools 
and was rejected to 14 of them 
because they said, ‘Hey you’re a 
great student but when you can get 
this situation figured out, give us a 
call.’ ”

Despite being accepted to one 

of the schools she applied to, the 
tuition of a private school was still 
more than she could afford. As an 
undocumented student, she could 
not qualify for any loans or federal 
aid.

“Luckily 
that 
with 
private 

institutions … they can give you 
personal grants, so they are able 
to fund you (through means) not 
tied to things like FAFSA or Federal 
Financial Aid,” she said. This 
allowed her to qualify for merit-
based aid.

The male LSA junior from 

Mexico, he graduated from high 
school in 2013, the same year that 
the University of Michigan changed 
its tuition policy for undocumented 
students, so he was not yet eligible 
for in-state tuition when he needed 
to apply to the university. Due to this 
cost barrier, he spent three years at 
a community college, and still faced 
challenges qualifying for in-state 
tuition when he transferred to the 

University.

Undocumented 
students, 

including those protected by DACA, 
can only qualify for in-state tuition 
for up to 28 months after graduating 
high school, according to the 
University’s in-state tuition policy. 
Under that rule, he didn’t qualify for 
in-state tuition.

“I had to jump through a lot of 

hoops trying to get that sorted out 
because nobody on the paid staff 
knew what to do,” he said. “Not (a lot) 
of people know that that’s an issue. I 
know a lot of other undocumented 
undergraduate students who have 
gone through that, and not just 
undergraduate, graduate students 
as well.”

In-state 
tuition 
for 

undocumented immigrants varies 
from state to state; in Michian, 
the University is the only in the 
state that grants in-state tuition to 
undocumented students.

According to the Migration 

Policy Institute, 66 percent of 
approximately 1.9 million eligible 
undocumented immigrants have 
applied to and received the benefits 
DACA has to offer.

Still, despite what DACA can do 

for undocumented individuals, it 
is not a legal immigration status. 
DACA only grants temporary legal 
presence and the ability to work. 
While there is a path for some DACA 
recipients to receive a green card, 
there is not a clear pathway for many 
to achieve citizenship.

“This whole concept of ‘go 

back and do it the right way,’ don’t 
you think if that was the case we 
would’ve done it the right way the 
first time?” the undocumented 
Rackham student said.

“I can speak with confidence that 

a lot of people have been brought 
here as children and only know the 
United States as their home … they 
would love to be citizens,” the male 
LSA Junior added.

Living without citizenship stokes 

fear and uncertainty for students 
and 
mixed-status 
communities, 

or even communities where both 
documented and undocumented 
peoples live — some as nearby as 

The 
Office 
of 
Academic 

Innovation partnered with edX, 
a massive online open course 
provider, on Tuesday evening to 
hold a Design Jam for University 
of Michigan students. The event 
was held so edX could hear from 
students about its program and 
get a new perspective on the 
issues within their platform they 
want to solve.

MOOCs are online higher-

education classes available to 
learners at all levels and with all 
interests. The University partners 
with edX, as well as with other 
providers like Coursera, to create 
classes 
taught 
by 
University 

professors for the platform. 

The event aimed to facilitate 

the discussion of solutions and 
creation of prototypes to solve 
some of the challenges edX faces 
within their company. According 
to Rachel Niemer, director of the 
University’s Gameful Learning 
Lab and the organizer of the 
event, design labs are important 
because they allow students 
to enter conversations about 
innovation that are traditionally 
faculty-based.

“Our mission is to create a 

culture of innovation on campus, 
and we interact a lot with faculty 
… but we love to go directly to 
students and get their fantastic 
ideas,” Niemer said. “We find that 
the students, because they are 
immersed in the act of learning 
right now, have really unique 

insights.”

While the edX lab did not 

draw a large crowd of students, 
the handful present were able to 
interact directly with edX team 
members and faculty from the 
Office of Academic Innovation in 
a collaborative discussion.

Iain Kennedy, vice president 

of product at edX and Ross 
School of Business alum, began 
the event with an overview of 
edX’s history and mission. In 
the five and a half years since its 
creation in 2012, edX has gained 
10 million registered “learners,” 
or people who take classes on the 
site. As a nonprofit organization, 

it partners with more than 120 
academic institutions — including 
the University — to create classes 
that are generally free and open to 
the public.

“Our mission as an organization 

… is to make the best education in 
the world available to anyone in 
the world,” Kennedy said. “What 
we’re hoping to get out of today 
is some insight from folks such as 
yourselves into how we can advise 
that mission.”

After Kennedy’s statement, 

students grouped together to 
discuss the questions posed by 
edX. Some of these questions dealt 
with increasing interactivity and 

communication among learners 
and making the experience more 
reputable and meaningful.

Students 
began 
by 

brainstorming solutions to the 
questions edX asked them as they 
compared and contrasted MOOCs 
with their in-person University 
courses. LSA freshman Amar 
Srinivasan quickly turned the 
conversation to how questions 
should be asked and answered in 
the online format.

“If I was in this situation, 

what would I want?” Srinivasan 
said. “Open forum would be 
interesting, one where you can 

Effective May 1, former U.S. 

Attorney Barbara McQuade, a 
University of Michigan alum, will 
join the Law School faculty as 
a professor of national security, 
criminal 
law 
and 
criminal 

procedure.

McQuade was appointed by 

former President Barack Obama 
in 2010 as the first woman to serve 
as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern 
District 
of 
Michigan, 
which, 

according to the Detroit Free Press, 
covers 34 counties and 6 million 
residents. During her tenure, she 
oversaw over 1,000 cases and over 
100 attorneys a year.

After resigning from her post 

following 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s inauguration, McQuade 
told the Law School she is excited 
to begin teaching here, especially 
given the circumstances of the 
times.

“I am honored to return to 

Michigan Law School to teach the 
next generation of law students at 
a critical moment in our nation’s 
history,” McQuade told the Law 
School.

This article is the second part of 

an ongoing series of articles outlining 
specific initiatives of Central Student 
Government on campus.

Providing 
financial 
support 

to more than 300 active student 
organizations on campus, the 
Student 
Organization 
Funding 

Commission is the funding body 
of Central Student Government’s 
executive commission.

Every semester, SOFC receives 

more than 400 requests from 
several 
student 
organizations 

asking to be supported by CSG. This 
semester, the body reviewed about 
50 groups each Sunday. SOFC has 
funded groups such as the Solar 
Car Team, Dance Marathon and 
TedxUofM.

SOFC Chair Kevin Yang, a 

Business junior, said though they 
have a substantial amount of 
money — about $200,000 — to 
award to student organizations, the 
process of reviewing applications 
is difficult, and requires them to 
expand and add several positions.

“We award about just shy of 

half a million dollars every single 
year to these student organizations

Students seeking to celebrate 

Pi Day by consuming massive 

amounts of pies of all sorts had a 

variety of on-campus locations to 

choose from on Tuesday.

Pieology Pizzeria offered 

specially priced $3.14 pizzas at all 

locations — however, because of 

heavy student demand for pies, 

Pieology ran out of dough and was 

forced to close at 5:30 pm for “a few 

hours” in order to restock. 

Tau Beta Pi, a University of 

Michigan engineering honor 

society, is no stranger to this 

predicament. Last year, the group 

planned to hand out free slices of 

pizza to students on campus, but 

ran out in 40 minutes. However, 

the group was much better 

prepared for Pi Day 2017.

Stationed in the lobby of the 

Duderstadt Center, they made 

their slices much thinner than last 

year to produce enough for hungry 

students and pi-lovers alike.

Engineering junior Joanna 

Ciatti, Tau Beta Pi secretary, told 

MLive the organization bought 

100 pies and sliced each pie into 

eighths.

“Last year we had 70 pies and 

we ran out in 40 minutes,” she said. 

“This year we got 100 and we 

sliced them into eighths, so we’ve 

got 800 slices.”

Students who could not 

make it to State Street or North 

Campus also had the opportunity 

to partake in Pi Day at one of the 

many on-campus dining halls. 

Michigan Dining celebrated the 

world-renowned mathematical 

constant by fueling potential 

mathematicians with a many 

pie-themed foods, including 

savory pot pies and sweet 

desserts. According to a blurb 

on its website, the food service 

calculated that it would need an 

immense number of pies needed 

to serve the campus community.

“What day is infinitely better 

than all the rest?” the blurb read. 

“Pie Day! All dining halls will be 

serving pie inspired foods at all 

meals! We calculated that we’ll 

need hundreds of pies to satisfy 

your never-ending appetite for 

circular foods! Selections include, 

chicken pot pies, fruit pies, pizza 

pies, dessert pizzas, and much 

more!”

on campus, and we consist of a 
group of around 35 (commission 
members),” Yang said.

The CSG budget comes from the 

$9.19 each student at the University 
pays per term.

LSA junior Amanda Hampton, 

a 
SOFC 
chair, 
added 
SOFC 

currently has two different types 
of applications: reimbursement 
funding and advance funding.

Reimbursement 
funding 

has 
traditionally 
been 
the 

most common way for student 

organizations to receive money 
from SOFC because they are able 
to present receipts for costs they 
have incurred while putting on 
events or organizing activities, and 
are compensated by CSG for these 
costs.

“This is just a way for us, as an 

organization, to give out the most 
money possible to student orgs and 
make sure that every dollar that 
is handed out goes toward events 
that student orgs want to put on,” 
Hampton said.

Advance funding is a new 

method 
the 
commission 

created this semester. Student 
organizations can request funds 
before their events in advance, 

providing receipts afterward and 
return any money not used.

“We 
realized 
that 

reimbursement 
really 
benefits 

student orgs that … are financially 
well off.” Hampton said. “It is 
disadvantaging to orgs that are 
maybe brand new, and don’t really 
have the funds to put on events or 
afford things they need to rent.”

Hampton also mentioned SOFC 

focuses on ensuring every student 
organization has equal access to 
funds.

“We’re trying to expand our 

reach as an organization and 
help as many student orgs as 
possible,” Hampton said. “We’ve 
allocated a certain amount of 

funds to each week, to ensure 
that every student org has 
the same chance of getting 
funding each wave. Before 
then, we didn’t do that and so 
it would end up that the first 
wave, a lot of student orgs 
would get a lot of money, and 
then we’d run out of money 
by the end of the semester. So 
we’ve really been stepping up 
and making sure we are on 
track with our funds.”

The 
chairs 
also 
offer 

office 
hours, 
where 
they 

give 
members 
of 
student 

organizations 
the 
option 

to sit down and talk with 
SOFC members about their 
applications. Because SOFC 
only has a limited amount of 
money to award organizations 
and the application process is 
competitive, the chairs feel 
this is the best way to receive 
the 
maximum 
amount 
of 

money for them.

“If it’s a student org’s first 

time applying and they’ve 
never gone through a financing 
process 
or 
an 
on-campus 

funding body before, a lot of 
the times we do recommend 
that they stop by and say 
hello in office hours,” Yang 
said. “We want to give them 
the whole plan of how to go 
about approaching it as well as 
point them to other sources of 
funding available for them. We 
see student orgs who do that 
come in with a lot of success in 
their funding process.”

The Michigan softball team 

is ranked No. 19 in the nation 
and stacked with solid players 
up and down its roster, but has 
continued to underperform 
through the first five weeks of 
the season. As the Wolverines 
(14-7-1) prepare for their home 
opener 
this 
week 
against 

Bowling Green, contributions 
from both experienced players 
and 
relative 
newcomers 

will be needed to reverse 
what Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins 
has 
deemed 
a 

season where her team is 
just “not playing the game of 
softball.” The Daily breaks 
down the Wolverines position 
by position: Pitchers: A fall 
season without softball in 
order to heal nagging injuries 
helped boost senior right-
hander Megan Betsa to a 
new high so far this year. 
Betsa returns to the No. 1 
starting role and has already 
demonstrated her prowess in 
the circle early on. While a 
6-5 record may look unnatural 
for a pitcher who went 28-5 
last year, it’s not indicative of 
her production. Betsa boasts 
a stellar earned run average 
of 1.99 and ranks third in the 
nation with 134 strikeouts in 
14 appearances — on pace for 
her best-ever season total. 
She has also reduced her walk 
total and pitch count, both 
of which have been major 
concerns in the past. Her 31 
walks in 77 innings and 4.32 
strikeout-to-walk 
ratio 
put 

her on track for career-best 
marks 
in 
both 
categories. 

With the graduation of right-
hander Sara Driesenga, the 
Wolverines have looked to Tera 
Blanco as a dependable starter 
behind Betsa in the rotation. 
And that’s exactly what the 
current Big Ten Pitcher of the 
Week has done, posting an 8-2 
record and a 2.08 ERA. The 
junior right-hander is coming 
off her best outing of the 
season, striking out a career-
high 13 batters and allowing 
just two hits, one unearned 
run and no walks in a 5-1 win 

against Kent State last Sunday. 
Rounding out the rotation is 
sophomore 
Leah 
Crockett, 

who has allowed a grim seven 
hits and six runs in just three 
innings of work. Catchers: The 
past two weekends have given 
clarity to the starting catcher 
role. After being behind the 
plate for a majority of the early 
season — with juniors Aidan 
Falk 
and 
Amanda 
Vargas 

receiving intermittent starts 
— sophomore Alex Sobczak’s 
performance 
declined. 
She 

batted a dismal .194 with just 
six hits, committed two errors 
and allowed seven passed balls. 
That left the door open for the 
starting job, and sophomore 
Katie Alexander rose to the 
occasion. 
Starting 
nine 
of 

the last 10 games, Alexander 
notched 12 hits in 36 at-bats 
and scored five times, with 
no errors and only one passed 
ball. First Base: When not in 
the circle, Blanco starts at 
first base for her third straight 
year. Though touted as one of 
the purest Wolverine hitters 
in previous seasons, she has 
struggled thus far, hitting .218 
with just two extra-base hits 
and a .291 slugging percentage 
— the second lowest among 
players who have started more 
than seven games. At this time 
last year, Blanco enjoyed a 
.426 batting average and .607 
slugging 
percentage. 
With 

Blanco pitching almost half 
the games so far, Falk has 
primarily taken over the duties 
at first, hitting .317 and leading 
the team with 10 extra-base 
hits, including seven doubles. 
In the field, Falk ranks third 
on the team with 55 putouts 
and has yet to make an error 
through 21 games. Second 
Base: With the graduation 
of one of Michigan’s all-
time greats, Sierra Romero, 
sophomore 
Faith 
Canfield 

earned 
the 
job 
as 
her 

replacement. 
Canfield 
has 

proven her value as a starter, 
sporting a .333 batting average 
and tying for the most home 
runs with four, already besting 
her total from last year. A go-to 
utility player as a freshman, 
Canfield 
transformed 
into 

a 
more 
consistent 
player 

and has been a bright spot 
despite 
the 
Wolverines’ 

offensive 
struggles. 
Third 

Base: Though she is hitting a 
disappointing .261 — senior 
Lindsay Montemarano’s track 
record of turning it around 
at the plate and dominant 
defensive 
command 
gives 

her a strong footing at third. 
Coming off a junior season 
with career-bests in seven 
offensive categories — earning 
All-Big Ten second team and 
Big Ten All-Defensive Team 
honors — Montemarano could 
be primed for another solid 
season once she starts hitting 
her stride. Shortstop: Senior 
Abby Ramirez continues to 
lead the infield in her fourth 
year starting at shortstop, 
putting up Michigan’s third 
best batting average at .373, 
and appears on pace to surpass 
her season-high in hits with 
25 to date. Ramirez’s presence 
toward the top of the order 
affords the Wolverines quality 
at-bats and speed, as she 
already has eight steals in 
10 attempts — matching her 
career-best as a freshman. 
Outfield: After a major drop 
in offensive production last 
year, 
senior 
center 
fielder 

Kelly Christner looks like 
she 
has 
returned 
to 
her 

sophomore form, when she 
was unanimously selected to 
the All-Big Ten first team. 
The 
second-year 
captain 

ranks first on the team in 10 
offensive categories, including 
a career-high .476 batting clip 
and a .730 slugging percentage. 
Christner leads an outfield 
that includes two new faces — 
sophomores Natalie Peters and 
Courtney Richardson. Peters 
has effectively transitioned 
into her leadoff role after 
being a utility player as a 
freshman. The speedy slap 
hitter is hitting .400, second 
highest on the team, with 24 
hits and 15 runs. Richardson, 
despite a .257 batting average, 
has seen spurts of success at 
the plate, including a three-
run home run and five-hit 
weekend 
in 
the 
season’s 

opening tournament.

Michigan’s positional breakdown

BENJAMIN KATZ

Daily Sports Writer

new world of ideas for me when 
I was a student there, and I am 
thrilled to join its great faculty. 
Helping students to develop a deep 
understanding of our laws, courts 
and legal system has never been 
more important.”

Law School Dean Mark West, 

the Nippon Life Professor of 
Law, said in the same statement, 
given McQuade’s work ethic and 
extensive legacy, she will bring 
experience and perspective to the 
classroom.

“Her 
legacy 
includes 
an 

impressive number of important 
convictions, and our students will 
benefit tremendously from the 
experience and perspective she 
brings to the classroom,” said West 
in a statement. “I am thrilled to 
welcome Barb home to Michigan 
Law as a member of our faculty.”

Shelley 
Rodgers, 
Chief 

Communications Officer of the 
Law School, said in an interview 
McQuade has a strong reputation as 
a mentor to students.

“As a Michigan Law graduate, 

Barbara McQuade has had a 
connection with the Law School 
since her days as a student,” 
Rodgers said. “She has a long and 
distinguished career in practice and 
teaching and can really make the 
law come alive for our students with 
practical legal training that is rooted 
in real world experience. She also has 
a strong reputation as a mentor and is 
dedicated to counseling students to 
become effective lawyers. We have 
been hoping to find ways to work to 
work with her for a while and the 
timing is right.”

Some 
of 
McQuade’s 
other 

accomplishments 
include 

convicting more than 30 public 
officials in Detroit on public 
corruption 
charges, 
including 

former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. 
She also was integral in convicting 
the Al-Qaeda operative who tried 
blowing up a plane over Detroit on 
Christmas Day in 2009.

McQuade also has previous 

experience teaching, having taught 
criminal law at the University of 
Detroit Mercy from 2003 to 2009 as 
an adjunct professor.

easily ask questions and get them 
answered.”

The facilitation of questioning 

eventually became the focus of 
the student group. While students 
discussed the issues in their own 
teams, the Office of Academic 
Innovation and edX staff formed 
teams themselves. The groups 
eventually 
came 
together 
to 

collaborate and discuss some of the 
solutions they came up with.

Noni Korf, the director of the 

University’s Digital Education and 
Innovation Lab, brought up the 
idea of using “bots” and systems 
of artificial intelligence to keep up 
with the magnitude and speed of 
questions that might come into an 
edX course.

“We were in a talk this morning 

and someone was talking about 
having used the IBM Watson 
(an artificial intelligence system) 
to be on the discussion boards, 
answering questions, and that 
was apparently very successful 
with a speedy response,” Korf said. 
“When you post something and 

nobody answers it, it’s really lonely, 
and there you are, with 50,000 
people. It’s horrible to be lonely 
with 50,000 people.”

After a collaboration session, 

the 
students 
regrouped 
to 

discuss further and pose their 
final ideas to the edX team. 
They discussed how to establish 
credibility and trust among 
students who wanted to answer 
their 
classmates’ 
questions 

themselves, as well as how to 
find questions that might have 
been asked in the past. LSA 
sophomore Alex Wilf proposed 
a tiered system for finding 

previously asked questions or 
those asked by other students.

“I think it might be cool if 

you gave people the ability to 
search not only the discussion 
but the module, then the unit 
module, and then you could 
bring that out to a class level, 
and then you could bring that 
back to previous classes as well 
to see that data,” Wilf said. “This 
would create a tiered system that 
would go beyond just the in-class 
discussion (forum).”

Participants 
stated 
they 

left the event feeling excited 
about the future of edX and its 

relationship with the University. 
Kennedy said he found the 
session helpful and engaging, 
and was ready to work on 
expanding the ideas brought up 
at the Design Jam.

“I’m really impressed with 

what the Michigan team is 
doing,” he said. “I think this is a 
group of people who really get it 
… Michigan’s really taking this 
very seriously but at the same 
time, Michigan has a personality 
and they’re bringing that to the 
online space and as a graduate of 
the school, I think that’s really 
fantastic.”

Ypsilanti. Even though DACA 
recipients 
receive 
deportation 

relief, in most cases their parents 
are still vulnerable.

“Every morning you wake 

up, like not knowing, especially 
now, knowing whether or not 
my parents will get in trouble at 
work or something, especially 
now given that there have been 
a couple ICE (Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement) raids in 
east Michigan,” she said. “That’s 
always been kind of scary. It’s one 
of those things where you still are 
always worried whether you come 
home or you get a call saying this 
happened. You never know.”

ICE is the law enforcement 

agency that enforces federal laws 
regarding immigration, trade and 
border control. ICE has become 
known for conducting raids on 
homes and place of residence of 
undocumented citizens and mass 
deportations

Most recently, there was an 

ICE raid in Ypsilanti on Feb. 24 
that arrested four undocumented 
immigrants. This raid took place 
a three days after an ICE raid in 
Detroit.

These raids have proven to 

bear 
considerable 
effects 
on 

communities 
and 
individuals 

alike, a phenomenon studied by 
William Lopez, a postdoctoral 
fellow in the School of Social Work. 
Lopez’s work has examined how 

communities respond to ICE raids, 
specifically researching the effects 
of an ICE raid that took place in 
2013 in Ann Arbor.

“So you have the individual 

trauma of being in this raided 
building in a situation where you’re 
wondering if you’re going to live 
to see the next day,” he said. “Two 
people said, ‘I didn’t know if I was 
going to get shot.’ And then in 
the community level, there’s this 
enormous, just fear of police as 
folks are reminded of this tenuous 
hold they have on their lives in the 
U.S. One day you’re here, the next 
day you could be removed.”

The trauma of ICE raids is 

amplified when a child’s parents 
or caregivers are deported, Lopez 
said. This can have many adverse 
effects on children, depending on 
the situation the child is left in.

“You get this question often; 

it kind of feels like the question 
is going towards, like do kids get 
depressed or have anxiety or have 
(post-traumatic stress disorder),” 
Lopez said. “So the answer I 
usually say is, probably.”

In 
many 
situations, 
single 

caregivers often have to prioritize 
children going to school or feeding 
them instead of taking them to see 
a counselor to treat the trauma.

“Do these mothers want to take 

their children to a counselor to 
get a diagnosis of mental health 
or are they trying to get them to 
school every day, are they trying to 
feed them, are they going to their 
lawyers?” Lopez said.

Fear of police, especially in 

collaborative 
raids 
in 
which 

ICE works with local police 
departments 
in 
deportation 

raids, leaves lasting marks on a 
community.

“You come in for graduation and 

your parents get a parking ticket — 
it’s not a big deal,” Lopez said. “But 
for many of these folks that are 
worried about ‘If my mom’s going 
to come for graduation and there’s 
a security guard, is the security 
guard going to ask for a license if 
she double parks? Is that going to 
be the end?’ ”

Undocumented 
immigrants 

are left without driver’s licenses 
issued by the United States, which 
forces them to drive illegally, if they 
choose to drive at all.

“I know my parents, they don’t 

drive with licenses and stuff like 
that,” the female LSA junior said. 
“There’s a reason why they’re 
really good drivers.”

In 
attempt 
to 
protect 

undocumented immigrants within 
their jurisdictions, many cities have 
declared sanctuary status. Still, no 
real definition of a sanctuary city 
exists. Law Prof. Margo Schlanger, 
an expert on civil rights issues, said 
no expert can determine exactly 
what a sanctuary city is.

“I don’t know what a sanctuary 

city is and neither does anybody 
else,” Schlanger said. “It is a phrase 
that some places have used, it’s not 
a phrase that we’ve used.”

To begin to define what a 

sanctuary city is, experts have 
looked to an executive actionsigned 
by President Donald Trump, which 

threatens to cut federal funding to 
so-called sanctuary cities.

“The president recently released 

an executive order, which says 
that sanctuary jurisdictions will 
have some repercussions in terms 
of federal funding and seems to 
define a sanctuary jurisdiction as 
a jurisdiction meaning a state, or a 
unit of a state, which includes us,” 
Schlanger said. “And so it seems 
to define a sanctuary jurisdiction 
to be that: a jurisdiction that is 
violation of 8 USC 1373.”

The University has not used 

this term to define recent action or 
campus jurisdiction, but University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
has 

affirmed the University will not 
share information regarding the 
immigration status of students. 
The Ann Arbor city council is 
currentlydiscussing an ordinance 
that would prohibit police from 
soliticing 
immigration 
status. 

Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton 

(D-Ward 4) said the Council has 
refrained from using the term 
“sanctuary city,” in any of its 
ordinance because of its lack of 
legimate legal defintion. 

Councilmember Jane Lumm 

(I-Ward 2) has pushed back against 
the 
new 
proposed 
ordinance 

fearful of the effects it could have 
on Ann Arbor’s federal funding. 

“So the University has been 

really clear that unless they are 
legally compelled to do so, they’re 
not going to share information 
about 
people’s 
immigration 

status, and even if they are legally 
compelled to do it, since they 

mostly don’t collect it, they don’t 
have it to share,” Schlanger said.

For now, it remains to be seen 

whether the threats of funding 
cuts from Trump, the Department 
of Justice and the Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
will 

materialize into anything more 
than threats. Schlanger noted 
outcomes depend on a number of 
factors.

“They haven’t defined sanctuary 

jurisdiction, they haven’t specified 
what the funding streams are, they 
haven’t described the mechanism, 
they haven’t given anybody notice 
about what any of that would mean, 
and if they don’t do all of those 
things, it will be illegal for them 
to withhold funding on the basis 
of it,” Schlanger said. “Once they 
do all of that stuff, then it might or 
might not be illegal, depending on 
the content of all of the answers to 
all of those questions.”

The new administration has 

many immigrants, documented or 
not, wondering what will happen 
today, tomorrow or a week from 
now. Though Trump has said 
deporting anyone here illegally 
is a priority, any difference from 
Obama regarding the number of 
people deported remains to be 
told.

Under 
Obama, 
roughly 

2.7 
million 
undocumented 

immigrants were deported, more 
than any other president to date.

W

hen discussing my 
enrollment 
here 

at 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
with 
anyone 

other than a fellow 
student, I am always 
asked 
the 
classic 

question “What are 
you studying?” and I 
always hesitate before 
I say, with a cringe, 
“I’m 
undeclared.” 

I quickly follow up 
with a rushed answer 
of what I am planning 
on declaring. It does 
not matter that this 
is my first year, or that I have 
another year before I need to 
decide; it is expected that I 
have an answer. 

But there is a problem 

with trying to force students 
into a major too quickly. By 
pressuring myself to have an 
actual answer for everyone 
who asks me this, I now have 
tunnel vision. My constant 
repetition of this one answer 
has solidified it in my mind as 
my only option, and it leaves 
no room for consideration 
of other majors. It is like a 
brainwashing 
technique 
I 

have performed on myself.

In addition to needing my 

major decided upon, I also 
apparently need to know what 
job I want, what kind of career 
I want to dedicate my life to. 
This has happened to many 
of us. When your answer to 
“What’s your major?” is met 
with more questions like “And 
what can you do with that?” 
instead of offering words of 
encouragement 
for 
having 

one part of our life decided, 
we are expected to not only 
know our five-year plan, but 
also our 10-year plan, even 
our 15-year plan.

Our lives are expected to 

be planned out by the time 
we graduate, with an outline 
that includes not only the first 
job we have lined up, but also 
our entire career plan for the 
rest of our lives. According to 
our family and bosses, if we 
do not know where we want 
our lives to go, we will forever 
be wandering, lost with no 
purpose motivating us to go 
to work. We are told our key 

to success is to plan out every 
second of our future so we 
always know what the next 
step is.

As a result of this 

pressure, we begin 
to force ourselves to 
make choices that 
limit our options 
for the future. We 
see this in the types 
of internships we 
choose, the classes 
we take and the 
higher 
education 

we pursue. Rather 
than keeping our 

doors open when searching 
for jobs after graduation, we 
are narrowing our focus to 
a one-way track that can fall 

apart if one step does not 
happen as planned.

For instance, if one wishes to 

become a professor, a Ph.D. is 
required. You make it through 
graduate school, potentially 
incurring 
thousands 
of 

dollars of debt, and enter the 
job market ready to change 
the world by teaching the next 
generation. However, based 
on a study done on the 2014 
U.S. Ph.D. recipients, a little 
less than half with definite 
job commitments said they’d 
hold a job in academia. This 
shows that even after earning 
a Ph.D., it’s not unusual for 
your career plan to change 
and force you to adapt to the 
new circumstances you find 
yourself in.

With no alternative, we 

leave ourselves with no room 
for the unexpected, no room 
to adjust to unplanned events 
that can put damaging kinks 

in our tightly wound plans. 
For example, there is that 
one class, possibly a few 
classes, in every major that 
is critical to moving on to the 
higher-level 
requirements. 

We try hard to do well in 
those classes, and we tell 
ourselves if we are meant for 
that major we should do well 
in them, but when some of us 
still end up with a far less-
than-satisfactory grade, that 
may throw a wrench in the 
coveted life plan we have been 
prompted to establish.

We begin to question if 

this major is what we should 
do, 
yet 
because 
we 
have 

only devoted our time and 
thinking into this one option, 
we have no backup plan. So, 
instead of asking students to 
force themselves into making 
decisions some may not be 
ready to make, we should 
be allowed to consider all 
options one at a time and not 
be afraid to diverge from the 
original plan if necessary.

We need to accept that 

there is no one specific path 
for each of us as individuals or 
even to get to a specific career; 
everyone will get to where 
they are in life a different 
way. At one of the workshops 
during my orientation last 
summer, we were shown the 
familiar diagram that links 
some of the larger majors in 
LSA to the numerous careers 
each can lead to. We should 
refer to this to inspire us, and 
relieve some of the anxiety of 
picking a major and deciding 
upon a career.

Therefore, answering the 

question “What job can you 
get with that major?” does 
not need to bring us to our 
knees in an effort to explain 
our reasoning for making 
this choice. We must remind 
ourselves that a career is not 
made out of one decision we 
make when we are 19, and 
we must trust ourselves to 
eventually find the job and 
career path that suits us — 
something no one can tell us.

S

pring Break may be over, 
but for me, profound 
experiences 
remain. 

It was my first time leaving 
and 
returning 
to 

the country as a 
green-card 
holder. 

The 
most 
salient 

moment 
of 
my 

trip 
was 
coming 

back to the United 
States 
through 

immigration 
with 

such 
ease. 
The 

swiftness 
of 
the 

process startled me 
because that was not 
the case 11 years ago when I 
first came to the United States 
from South Korea with a visa.

When I first arrived to the 

States, I was 10 years old — 
quiet, 
unfamiliarized 
and 

curious about the new life 
ahead of me. This anticipation, 
however, did not begin with 
hopes and dreams but was 
sunken by a skeptical Customs 
and Border Protection officer 
who scrutinized me and my 
family. 
At 
immigration, 
I 

observed my parents trying 
their best to catch the officer’s 
quick utterances and articulate 
back a response with their very 
imperfect English.

After many questions and 

answers that went back and 
forth, there came a moment 
that I’ll never forget. My mom 
answered no to a question that 
actually applied to us. My dad 
corrected the answer but this 
confusion put us aside for a bag 
search. I observed the people in 
dark blue uniforms take out my 
personal items one by one. If 
you don’t know what this feels 
like, imagine being stripped of 
your clothes in public piece by 
piece. That’s what it felt like 
to me, as a 10-year-old in a 
strange, new place, naked and 
violated.

Because of this incident, 

airports 
quickly 
became 

unpleasant and invasive places 
for me. What used to symbolize 
freedom, 
bravery 
and 

adventure, I no longer believed 
in. Since then, when I would 
hear friends were flying out 
to places such as the Bahamas, 

Cabo, Cancun, etc., 
it never occurred to 
me that I, too, could 
enjoy the process. 
I wanted to travel, 
but I felt restrained. 
I wanted to explore, 
but I felt unable.

As 
a 
result, 

I 
avoided 
any 

subsequent 
opportunities 
to 

travel by air. And I 

became envious of those who 
led exuberant lifestyles, not 
because they flaunted their 
wealth, 
but 
because 
they 

embodied something that I 
didn’t — carefreeness.

In 2009, I became a green-

card holder. From what I 
understand, holding a green 
card 
makes 
things 
easier. 

People question you less. You 
blend in more with the crowd. 
Your 
contributions 
to 
the 

country start to be recognized. 
I knew these things to be true 
because this sense of belonging 
grew inside of me.

While these feelings grew, 

they were still small and 
incomplete. After years of 
saying no to visiting friends 
from out of state and family 
back in South Korea, a friend 
approached me to go on an 
international trip this Spring 
Break. 
I 
was 
conflicted. 

All the excuses that I’ve 
collected 
in 
my 
lexicon 

swarmed over me — flights 
are too expensive, planning 
a trip is hectic and traveling 
is just not worth the energy. 
Boy, was I wrong. Deciding 
to go on this trip changed my 
life. There were challenges 
along my travel but it taught 
me many things that may 
be trivial to most people but 
nonetheless invaluable to me.

I learned that I can’t use my 

nickname on the travel-agency 
site. Otherwise, I can’t fly out. 

(Yes, I missed my flight.) I 
learned that I have to put my 
laptop in a separate bin than 
my backpack for security. In 
addition 
to 
navigating 
the 

rules of travel, I learned that a 
tennis player from University 
of Toledo was headed to San 
Diego and takes pride in his 
bad haircut. I learned that a 
generous man who let me get 
in line before him had missed 
his flight the day before like 
me. (We exchanged a few 
chuckles.) These social aspects 
of a hectic day of travel were 
delightful. 

Above all, I learned that 

it is possible to feel safe 
and secure while traveling. 
Coming back, I was guided to 
use the mobile passport app 
to hasten the customs process 
like everyone else. Passing 
immigration, I was put in the 
same line as U.S. citizens, 
and the CBP officer greeted 
me with a “How are you?” 
without one question about 
my travel. I was stunned at 
the difference between going 
through security 11 years ago 
compared to now. 

This trip was significant 

because I was finally able to 
experience traveling in the 
way that people always spoke 
about. And I realized that 
this was a privilege. I came 
to understand how my visa 
status has determined my 
sense of personal freedom 
thus far. Therefore, I felt 
proud, and not ashamed, of 
my immigration status and 
was humbled by the privilege 
that 
came 
with 
being 
a 

permanent resident in the 
United States.

“Never forget where you 

come from,” they say. My 
parents worked hard to come 
to this country. And this was 
a special moment for me to 
remember that fact.

I 

hated Hebrew school. The 
monotonous 
repetition 

of prayer and cultural 

history always went in one ear 
and out the other — I found 
more joy in the laughter of my 
classmates after I was sent 
to the principal’s office for 
intentionally frustrating my 
teachers. Nevertheless, my 
parents insisted that Judaism 
remain a part of my identity, 
whether or not this learning 
occurred in a stained-glass 
sanctuary.

What stuck with me most 

growing up, unsurprising for a 
kid too stubborn to comprehend 
the religious significance of 
the events, was the celebration 
of holidays. Celebrated last 
weekend, Purim is one of the 
holidays that struck a chord 
with me. While much of my 
Jewish experience as a kid 
felt forced, such as my parents 
making me keep Kosher and 
attend synagogue on Shabbat 
mornings, Purim’s festivities 
never felt this way.

Purim, 
at 
its 
core, 
is 

a 
celebration. 
Barely 

understanding why, I dressed 
in 
elaborate, 
carnivalesque 

costumes with my younger 
sister as we sang and danced 
in place of traditional prayer. 
The festiveness of this holiday 
shines through its customs 
— eating Hamantaschen (a 
traditional 
Jewish 
dessert), 

using noisemakers and adults 
getting drunk (at the judgment 
of a rabbi, of course). I kind 
of thought of it as the Jewish 
version of Halloween.

But it was only recently, as 

I reflected on recent events in 
our community and country, 
that I began to grasp the 
underlying significance of the 
celebration of Purim.

Over the past few months, 

Jews across the country have 
experienced a shock with the 
prevalence 
of 
anti-Semitic 

threats 
toward 
schools, 

synagogues and other Jewish 
institutions. 
On 
March 
7, 

Chicago Jewish Day School, a 
mere 30 minutes from my house, 
received a bomb threat. This hit 
home. Even at the University 
of Michigan, threats in the 
form of hacked emails have 
rocked students like myself 
who never believed this hatred 
could exist on our campus. 
Coinciding with the rise of 
xenophobic, 
un-American 

attitudes and ethnically driven 
immigration bans, the anti-
Semitic sentiments come at a 
time when much of the country 
lives in fear.

Of course, these attitudes 

are not news to Jews across 
the world; some have even 
compared Trump’s rhetoric to 
Adolf Hitler’s use of the “Big 
Lie” during the rise of Nazism. 
And it was not until Feb. 21, 
after weeks of criticism from 
Jewish organizations for his 
lack of interest in the anti-
Semitic threats, that President 
Trump 
issued 
a 
public 

statement about these issues.

So, when the highest official 

in our country neglects to 
pay proper attention to the 
dangers of these ideologies, 
manifested in threats toward 
our communities, where do 
we turn?

Though we can look to 

our government for answers, 
hope for change can be found 
much closer to home, in the 
shape of a three-cornered, 
jelly-filled cookie.

Purim 
celebrates 
the 

Jewish victory over Haman, 
an evil associate of the Persian 

King who devised a plot to 
wipe out all of the Jews. Ring 
a bell? At no better time does 
this holiday, commemorating 
the defeat of anti-Semitism 
in ancient history, fall on our 
calendar.

No FBI investigation will 

completely stop the wave of 
recent threats, and it will 
certainly not eradicate the 
pervasiveness of anti-Semitic 
ideology across the country. 
Purim reminds us that one 
way to combat the hatred 
prevalent in our society is to 
laugh, dance and celebrate.

Acting as a festival of 

sorts, Purim encourages even 
the least religious people to 
come together in a joyous, 
collective motion of pride, 
identity and hope. Eating 
the 
Hamantaschen 
cookie, 

symbolizing 
the 
three-

cornered shape of the villain 
Haman’s hat, represents in 
a 
comical 
yet 
significant 

way 
our 
destruction 
of 

discrimination.

So, last weekend, although 

I did not dress up or attend 
services with my family, I 
kept in mind the significance 
of the holiday. Whether it 
occurred in the kitchen making 
cookies or in a sanctuary, Jews 
across the world celebrated 
a previous defeat of anti-
Semitism in an attempt to 
make change in the present. 
And in the process, many 
realized that their Jewish 
identity is not grounded in 
education, but in thought and 
action that lie beyond the 
constraints of a classroom.

Maybe 
I 
did 
learn 

something in Hebrew school 
after all.

Dancing in the face of anti-Semitism

‘Cries From Syria’ gives 
crisis needed humanity

New HBO documentary a laudably sobering look at Syria’s plight

You’ve seen the pictures. 

Two of them, specifically. 
You’ve seen the image of 
three-year-old 
Alan 
Kurdi, 

face down, dead, on the shores 
of a Turkish beach, lifeless 
in a bright red shirt and blue 
shorts. You’ve also seen five-
year-old 
Omran 
Daqneesh, 

painted 
grey 

in 
rubble 
and 

caked with blood 
against the stark 
orange backdrop 
of his chair. It’s 
quite 
startling, 

then, when these images begin 
to move — when the waves 
keep crashing into and passing 
over 
Kurdi’s 
body, 
when 

Daqneesh 
absent-mindedly 

picks at the blood on his face 
and examines his arms and 
feet.

“Cries From Syria,” Evgeny 

Afineevsky’s (“Winter on Fire: 
Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom”) 
new HBO documentary about 
the ongoing Syrian Civil War, 
is bookended by the footage 
from these two viral moments. 
It’s fitting. The youth — and, by 
extension, Syria’s increasingly 
uncertain future — are the 
focal point of Afineevsky’s 
unsparing film, the prism 
through 
which 
he 
frames 

each chapter and political 
development. Children, the 
movie argues, are the ones 
who have lost the most in this 
abhorrent humanitarian crisis 
(one of the world’s largest and 
most urgent), and it’s they 
who stand to gain the most 
if peace is to be achieved. 
In 
the 
documentary’s 

most disturbing scene, the 
aftermath of the sarin gas 
attack in Ghouta is laid bare 
for the audience to witness: 
Teenagers, toddlers, infants 
choking and unable to breathe, 
piles of convulsing bodies 
strewn about a chaotic hospital 
floor, children whose pupils 
have rolled back into their 
heads as their mouths foam 
viciously. 
It’s 
unwatchable, 

horrific, utterly depressing — 
and, at the risk of sounding too 
cliché, morally necessary.

Indeed, “Cries From Syria” 

is, at its most basic level, a 
profoundly 
graphic 
visual 

document of the atrocities 
of war. It is not a political 
film, insofar as its producers 

do not posit a critique of the 
Syrian opposition’s treatment 
of 
religious 
minorities 
or 

suggest the refugee crisis as 
an indirect result of American 
foreign 
policy. 
The 
movie 

is obviously positioned on 
the side of the Syrian Free 
Army, but its point of view is 
purely ground-level; the only 
voices heard in interviews 
are Syrian activists, refugees 
and defected army members. 

Outside 
of 
a 

particularly 
scathing 
segment 
critical of Putin 
and 
Russian 

airstrikes, 
the 

film doesn’t aim to persuade 
viewers 
on 
one 
political 

ideology over the other.

Rather, “Cries From Syria” 

subjects its audience to two 
hours of relentless carnage 
and bloodshed, focusing on the 
war as, objectively, a sickening 
global crisis. It sounds brutal 
to watch — and it is — but as 
the film makes clear, there is 
no other option. You have the 
luxury to gripe about having 
to endure two hours of misery 
on your TV screen — imagine 
that as your everyday, lived-in 
reality.

In 
fact, 
what’s 
most 

remarkable about Afineevsky’s 
documentary is that, well, it’s 
not really his. The footage is 
almost entirely amateur video 
from activists and citizen 
journalists as the events took 
place, and consequently, the 
film doesn’t pretend to be 
concerned with artful camera 
angles or an overproduced 
score. Save for what one 
assumes 
was 
a 
grievously 

difficult editing assignment, 
the documentarians recede 
into the background, silent, 
instead letting the cruelty of 
war and those who suffered 
— and still suffer — speak for 
themselves.

And as the film is structured 

chronologically, 
the 
final 

chapter ends, elegantly, with 
an honest look at the refugee 
crisis in our current political 
context. Each chapter, from 
Al-Assad’s appalling cruelty 
in Ghouta to ISIS’ barbaric 
takeover 
of 
Raqqah, 
has 

constituted a broad, forceful 
argument 
to 
bolster 
this 

declaration: 
A 
piercing 

portrait of families stranded, 
separated, 
displaced 
and 

utterly, completely abandoned. 

There are no easy answers, but 
it’s clear compassion is the only 
way forward. Yet as thousands 
of women and children are 
rejected, rounded up, or forced 
on to the streets by supposedly 
developed countries, we hear 
testimonials from a number of 
young orphans. Their families 
ripped apart, these children 
have no other outlet with 
which to air their titular cries.

It is sobering, to say the 

least, to confront your own 
inaction. Once you remove 
political 
inclinations 
and 

theorizing from the equation, 
you are left with nothing 
but a stark portrait of people 
less fortunate than you, and 
for whom you have done so 
shamefully little to help. What 
Syrian children, what Syrian 
women, what Syrian men, 
what all victims of the Syrian 
Civil war have endured is, for 
the most part, a concept in 
the abstract for many of us, 
a reality so far removed from 
our own that to even consider 
the possibility of a government 
using chemical weapons on its 
own citizens is to entertain 
the ludicrous. When the dust 
settles, then, when the picture 
is clearer and the gasbag 
rhetoric deflated: We will be 
remembered for a systematic 
dehumanization of a people 
who have done nothing but 
suffer; 
we 
will 
celebrate 

whatever supposed progress 
the world makes in the coming 
years, and it will be irrevocably 
tainted by the unequivocal 
shame of Executive Order 
13769; 
we 
will 
confront, 

without pretense, our refusal, 
both collective and individual, 
to fight for children who could 
be our own but, unfortunately, 
whose 
names 
sound 
too 

different and whose prayer 
rugs look too Middle Eastern; 
we will be forced to reckon 
with the profound idiocy of 
categorizing refugees as the 
terrorists they so desperately 
seek shelter from; we will, 
eventually and much, much 
too late, come to terms with 
the sadistic moral calculus 
our leaders feel the need to 
compute to determine who 
is worthy of safety and who 
is deemed a threat to this 
ethically 
bankrupt 
nation. 

The children of Syria have 
suffered, and we have ignored 
them; the cries have fallen 
on deaf ears, and indifferent 
hearts.

Snarky Puppy to take on Hill

Eclectic, 
funk-pop, 
jazz 

quasi-collective Snarky Puppy 
is about to inject some soul into 
Ann Arbor.

The band itself was formed 

in the college town of Denton, 
Texas while members were 
attending 
the 

University 
of 

North Texas.

 “I was writing 

music 
that 
sat 

somewhere 
between 
jazz, 

pop, 
and 
God-

knows-what, 
and asked 9 of 
my 
friends 
to 

play it with me 
every week,” wrote Michael 
League, bassist and bandleader 
for Snarky Puppy, in an email 
interview. “Things really just 
snowballed from there.”

Now based in Brooklyn, the 

group has evolved to grace the 
international landscape with 
its innovative sound.

“I 
find 
inspiration 
in 

many, many different musical 
traditions from around the 
world,” League wrote. “Each 
one 
teaches 
me 
something 

different. Piazzolla tells me to 
wear the emotion on my sleeve. 
Sufjan Stevens tells me never 
to show it. Stravinsky tells me 
to explore the entire universe 
of harmony. Ali Farke Touré 
tells me that two chords is all 
you need (if that). The whole 
universe of music is constantly 
offering you food if you’re 
hungry for it.”

With strands of everything, 

nothing 
and 
yet-to-be-

discovered melodies, Snarky 
Puppy 
rests 
in 
profound 

instances of utter originality, 
separating them from other 
contemporary 
instrumental 

groups.

The 
band 
is 
big 
(both 

literally 
and 
figuratively), 

consisting of instrumentalists 
Michael League (bandleader, 
composer, bass), Bill Laurance 

(keyboards), 
Justin 
Stanton 

(trumpet, keyboards), Shaun 
Martin 
(keyboards), 
Cory 

Henry 
(keyboards), 
Bob 

Lanzetti 
(guitar), 
Mark 

Lettieri 
(guitar), 
Chris 

McQueen 
(guitar), 
Mike 

Maher (trumpet), Jay Jennings 
(trumpet), Chris Bullock (tenor 
saxophone, 
flute, 
clarinet), 

Bob 
Reynolds 
(saxophone), 

Nate 
Werth 

(percussion), 
Marcelo Woloski 
(percussion/
drums), 
Keita 
Ogawa 

(percussion/
drums), 
Robert 

“Sput” 
Searight 

(drums), 
Larnell 

Lewis 
(drums) 

and Jason “JT” 

Thomas (drums).

An 
eccentric 
force 
of 

sound, Snarky Puppy recently 
won their third Grammy in 
February, taking home “Best 
Contemporary 
Instrumental 

Album” for their 11th record, 
Culcha Vulcha. Their music 
has no concrete destination, 
yet it hits every dot on the 
map. Spontaneous, carefully 
practiced, huge and miniscule 
all at once, their sound is one 
like no other.

“We 
never 
expect 
to 

win 
awards 
because 
we 

were unknown for so long. 
Although it doesn’t make you 
a better band, it creates new 
possibilities creatively. People 
trust and value you more, so the 
crazy ideas that we’ve always 
had in our heads can actually 
become reality. That’s what 
I’m most grateful for,” League 
wrote.

Propelled by their deserved 

recognition, the group isn’t 
afraid to take chances. They 
use their live performances as 
a time to delve into what makes 
their music so invigoratingly 
distinctive.

“One of my favorite things 

about Snarky Puppy is the 
way in which we improvise 
as a group,” League wrote. 
“The same song can be almost 

unrecognizably 
different 

from night to night based on a 
single thing that a single player 
contributes in a single moment. 
Everyone’s 
ears 
are 
open, 

receptive 
to 
the 
subtleties 

floating 
around 
the 
stage 

from each individual player, 
but 
without 
disrespecting 

the essential content of the 
composition itself. This allows 
us to consistently deliver the 
emotional content of the songs 
each night while allowing the 
music to grow and breathe, 
creating 
a 
unique 
musical 

experience 
each 
night 
(for 

better or worse!).”

League’s 
personal 
favorite 

songs 
to 
perform 
live 
are, 

“the 
ones 
that 
have 
the 

strongest melodies,” he wrote. 
“‘Shofukan,’ ‘Thing of Gold,’ 
‘Sleeper,’ ‘Flood’–– tunes like 
that. I feel that a good melody 
never gets old.”

Deeply 
passionate 
about 

their work, the group has an 
undeniably 
genuine 
nature. 

They understand their roots and 
challenge themselves out of a 
pure love for what they do.

“The band started much more 

acoustic, much jazzier. We were 
white college students from the 
suburbs who had grown up in 
garage rock bands and got swept 
away by jazz,” League wrote. “I 
think this is evident in our first 
few albums. But when we started 
playing on the predominantly 
black gospel/R&B scene in Dallas 
(and when people like Bernard 
Wright, Robert ‘Sput’ Searight, 
Shaun Martin and Bobby Sparks 
joined the band), the sound of the 
band changed dramatically. It 
got funkier. We started focusing 
more on groove and melody 
rather than complex harmony. 
But I think the most important 
change was that we became 
more 
communicative, 
and 

consequently, more accessible to 
audiences.”

Fearlessly 
exploring 
the 

limitlessness 
of 
their 
own 

abilities, Snarky Puppy is set to 
share their passion with Ann 
Arbor tomorrow, March 16, at 
Hill Auditorium.

SINGLE REVIEW

Frank Ocean has made it. If you 
didn’t believe that after Channel 
Orange, you do now after Blonde 
took over the world, sound-track-
ing that last hour of every party 
you’ve been to in the last seven 
months. He’s created a niche that 
few knew we needed, a mellow, 
brooding croon that fits better on 
midnight drives than the dance-
floor. Ocean has become a pop 
titan with only one true radio hit, 
now bigger than most straight-
edge pop artists. He is the new 
commercial.
You can recognize this on “Cha-
nel,” his first solo single since 
Blonde. The track is immediately 
recognizable as Ocean’s, the pen-
sive piano coupled with a mov-
ing, rhythmic syncopation that 
he mastered so well on Channel 
Orange. Though he left that pair-
ing behind a bit on Blonde in favor 
of more guitar and synth, it still 

sat beneath the surface of each of 
those tracks, and “Chanel” offers 
the perfect bridge to easily under-
stand how Orange and Blonde are 
two sides of the same coin. It’s 

also one of his most assured vers-
es in a while, more reminiscent 
of his verse on Earl Sweatshirt’s 
“Sunday” — “I mean he called me 
a faggot / I was just calling his 
bluff / I mean how anal am I gon’ 
be when I’m aiming my gun” — 
than most of the poetic muses on 
Blonde, which ruminated on love 
and loss.
On “Chanel” he dives into the 
theme of duality that he devel-
oped on Blonde, asserting that he 

“sees both sides like Chanel,” a 
reference to the two-sided Cha-
nel logo. He paints a beautifully 
jagged and seemingly contradic-
tory portrait of images that never 
stop to reassess, only to march 
on. Many have made the over-
simplified connection that this 
refers specifically to bisexuality, 
even though Ocean has publicly 
shirked that term. That ignores 
the dynamism that Ocean has 
long discussed, the power of 
ambiguity. He has always refused 
to be placed into a category.
“Chanel” is no different, and like 
all of his tracks, exists on a plane 
of its own. It, like Ocean himself, 
resists easy classification, clear 
only in the power to mesmerize — 
the power of perfection.

Flubs & Fury: The online 
crucifixion of the famous 

Let’s say a famous person — 

be it Beyoncé, Chrissy Teigen, 
Zach Galifianakis or Jason 
Derulo — made an ignorant 
comment on social 
media 
or 
in 
an 

interview that went 
viral. How would 
you react? Would 
you recognize that 
that person made a 
mistake? Or would 
you 
criticize 
and 

attack the person 
online, disregarding 
any 
possibility 
of 

giving the person a 
chance to apologize 
or clarify first? 

For most people, the latter 

seems like the more common 
response.

Because social media exists 

in a vacuum, there is no middle 
ground or room for when a 
person, particularly a celebrity 
or 
notable 
personality, 

receives 
vehement 
outrage 

for doing or saying something 
wrong. 
Online 
users 
have 

built idealistic expectations 
for how famous people and 
activists 
should 
present 

themselves 
without 
taking 

into consideration that famous 
people 
sometimes 
make 

mistakes and not everything 
they say should be taken at face 
value.

Even when celebrities make 

a statement or do something 
that isn’t inherently wrong 
or malicious, people will still 
react negatively if it’s even 
remotely problematic.

Take Emma Watson, for 

example. 
This 
past 
week, 

the “Beauty and the Beast” 
actress stirred some online 
controversy 
after 
posing 

semi-nude for a Vanity Fair 
photoshoot. Folks on Twitter, 
such as talkRADIO host Julia 
Hartley-Brewer, 
saw 
this 

as hypocritical to Watson’s 
proactive stance on feminism. 
In response, Watson defended 
herself in a press tour interview, 
remarking 
that 
she 
was 

stunned by misconceptions on 
her photoshoot and reiterating 
how 
feminism 
is 
“about 

freedom. It’s about liberation. 
It’s about equality. It’s not — I 
really don’t know what my tits 
have to do with it.”

Apparently, 
that 
wasn’t 

enough 
for 
some 
people. 

Several 
Twitter 
users 
dug 

up a 2014 interview with 
Watson that revealed her own 

discomfort 
with 

Beyoncé’s 
“Drunk 

in Love” video as a 
positive expression 
of 
feminism, 
as 

well as her own 
distaste for posing 
nude. 
Again, 

Watson 
defended 

herself, 
tweeting 

a 
screenshot 
of 

that 
interview, 

expanding on the 
context of her words 
that 
had 
become 

diluted by devout Beyoncé 
fans. 

What’s 
incredible 
about 

this kind of attack against 
Watson is not just that she 
had to defend herself twice 
for expressing herself, but that 
people took her words from an 
article from three years ago 
to justify Watson’s so-called 
“white feminism.” It’s almost 
as if people online can’t give 
famous people like Watson a 
break and recognize that their 
views and beliefs can change 
over time.

In 
addition 
to 
Watson, 

“Americanah” 
author 

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie 
caught some flak on social 
media recently for comments 
she made in an interview 
with Channel 4 News. When 
asked about whether or not 
transgender 
women 
should 

be 
considered 
“women,” 

Adichie responded by saying 
that “trans women are trans 
women,” 
a 
statement 
that 

many, specifically the trans 
community on Twitter, deemed 
transphobic. “It’s difficult for 
me to accept that then we can 
equate your experience with 
the experience of a woman,” 
Adichie said further, “who has 
lived from the beginning as a 
woman and who has not been 
accorded those privileges that 
men are.”

After her comments went 

viral 
on 
Twitter, 
Adichie 

clarified 
her 
position 
in 

a 
lengthy 
Facebook 
post, 

reinforcing her support for 
the rights of trans people 
and explaining the societal 
privileges 
and 
differences 

between cis and trans women. 
Some trans women, including 
Marit 
Stafstrom, 
embraced 

Adichie’s 
clarification, 
but 

others nevertheless remained 
bitter.

In one particular criticism, 

trans activist Raquel Willis 
tweeted 
in 
response 
to 

the 
interview, 
stating: 

“Chimamanda 
being 
asked 

about trans women is like 
Lena Dunham being asked 
about Black women. It doesn’t 
work. 
We 
can 
speak 
for 

ourselves.” Granted, in this 
case, it’s important to call out 
Adichie for saying something 
that may not have intended 
to be harsh but nevertheless 
was. In fact, Willis’s thread, 
which explained at length 
about the significance of trans 
representation in mainstream 
society, was a great, nuanced 
teaching moment for Achidie.

But what is also important 

for online users is to recognize 
that we should be open-minded 
to the idea that someone, 
celebrity or not, can take 
responsibility for their actions 
and realize their mistakes. 
There are plenty of celebrities, 
such as Alec Baldwin, Justin 
Bieber and Justin Timberlake, 
who 
have 
been 
guilty 
of 

saying something stupid and 
getting 
brutally 
ridiculed 

online before they could even 
apologize. Impact is always 
more important than intent, 
but we can’t expect everyone 
to know that. Social media 
has condensed information so 
immensely through sound-bite 
headlines that we’ve become 
so accustomed to accepting 
whatever is thrown at us, 
especially when it’s taken out 
of context.

There’s this presumption 

that 
famous 
artists 
and 

activists should conform to 
our own system of beliefs and 
values online. As a matter of 
fact, it is dangerous to presume 
that a famous person should 
simply be morally conscious 
24/7; 
it 
suggests 
that 
we 

possess moral entitlement and 
authority over other people. 
If we don’t take a grain to 
salt 
every 
time 
someone 

famous did or said something 
egregious, then there may be 
no celebrities left to trust.

For over two decades, The 

Shins 
have 
been 
pumping 

smooth, altruistic indie jams 
into the hands of their fans. 
Most recently, their fifth studio 
album Heartworms, comprised 
of 11 tracks, proves that The 
Shins still have a firm grasp 
on that alternative melancholy 
feel 
that 
they 

hone so well.

Like 
their 

other 
albums, 

the majority of 
the 
songs 
on 

Heartworms 
embody 
a 
similar 
sound. 

Perfect for background noise 
while studying or chilling, the 
asethetic of the album can best 
be described as gypsy, yoga, 
riding my bike through Cali 
with the wind and beach breeze 
blowing 
my 
way. 
Though 

the album in its entirety is 

enjoyable, it can be hard to pick 
a single track that stands from 
the rest. Still, three songs feel 
distinct: “Rubber Ballz,” “Dead 
Alive” and “So Now What.” 
Each possesses unique rhythms 
and lyrics that are memorable 
both in the context of the album 
and in isolation.

“Rubber Ballz” begins with 

some ping-pong Beach Boys-
esque 
vocals; 
the 
jubilant, 

upbeat rhythm and safe, PG 
lyrics work together to paint 

a 
portrait 
of 

nostalgia 
and 

better times.

“Dead 
Alive” 

brings the edgy 
melancholy. 
With 
unique 

instrumentation 
and 
an 

undoubtedly catchy rhythm, 
it feels like an ode to a chilly, 
mysterious October evening.

The most iconic song on the 

album, though, is “So Now 
What,” which was a single on 
the motion picture soundtrack 
for the 2014 critically acclaimed 

film 
“Wish 
I 
Was 
Here.” 

Featuring The Shins’ hallmark 
shimmering 
instrumentals 

and ethereal vocals, “So Now 
What” preys on your emotions 
in every way music is supposed 
to. It culls dusty memories to 
the forefront of your mind, 
makes you think and analyze 
again and again.

The remaining eight tracks 

on the album are not auditory 
flops, but they do lack the 
distinction of songs like “So 
Now What” provoke. All in all, 
Heartworms is a fine album. 
The thing about The Shins is 
that all of their albums, when 
analyzed as a collective unit, 
aren’t 
anything 
amazing. 

There’s no The Life of Pablo 
or Revolver; to make a perfect 
album where each song is great 
on its own and as a part of the 
album is rare. Still, The Shins 
always manage to produce at 
least two great songs on every 
album that will stand a decent 
test of time; at the end of the 
day, that’s still respectable.

‘A United Kingdom’ is a mess

Feel-good movies about race 

relations are an oxymoron, and yet 
Hollywood just keeps churning 
them out, doesn’t it? They’re easy 
to pick out by virtue 
of always having 
one “Good White 
Person” amidst all 
the 
“Bad 
White 

People.” You know, 
someone kind and 
so ahead of their 
time that they don’t 
even see color and 
they’ve always thought racism was 
bad, see, they just needed a push 
to stand up to their “Bad White 
Friends.” White viewers watch 
these movies, and we identify with 
the “Good White Protagonist,” of 
course. Because we totally would 
have been Kevin Costner beating 
down the sign in “Hidden Figures” 
if we had been alive at that time, and 
we definitely wouldn’t have been 
complicit in the institutionally-
mandated racism.

Yeah, I didn’t like “A United 

Kingdom” very much. Directed by 
Amma Asante (“Belle”), the film 
tells the real-life story of Seretse 
(David Oyelowo, “Selma”) and 
Ruth Khama (Rosamund Pike, 
“Gone Girl”), a biracial couple 
grappling with British imperialism 
in the late 1940s. Seretse is the heir 
to the throne of the African country 
Bechuanaland (now Botswana). 
He meets Ruth, a British secretary, 
while in law school in London. 
The two fall in love and decide 
to get married, a choice which 
threatens the diplomatic security 

of 
Bechuanaland, 
a 
British 

protectorate state. They receive 
opposition from both the British 
government and Seretse’s tribe 
back home, who see Ruth as an 
extension of Britain’s imperialist 
arm, trying to co-opt their years 
of tradition and national pride. 

The film details the 
couple’s 
attempts 

to become accepted 
by the people of 
Bechuanaland 
while 
grappling 

with the diplomatic 
nonsense 
the 

British government 
continually throws 

at them.

I’m sure that the real life Seretse 

and Ruth Khama were absolutely 
incredible, 
wildly 
interesting 

people. They led their country to 
independence, overcame horrible 
intolerance and devoted their lives 
to serving their people. Their film 
counterparts, however, have all 
the personality of some very pretty 
blocks of wood. Oyelowo and Pike 
are both wonderful, charismatic 
actors, but they’re not given very 
much to work with here, as their 
characters are simple bastions 
of pure good, free of any flaws or 
conflicts. They know exactly what 
they want secure in the knowledge 
that what they want is just right. 
They don’t grow or change at all 
throughout the film, because they 
are both perfect to begin with, 
without any second thoughts or 
excuses. Needless to say, watching 
perfect people be perfect together 
isn’t very interesting.

What is interesting is how much 

the film downplays the actual 
romance between the two. There’s 

a notable lack of chemistry between 
the leads, a fact which isn’t helped 
by the movie’s odd pacing that all 
but skips their initial courtship. 
They kiss for the first time with no 
sparks, and their wedding night is 
perhaps the least sexy sex scene 
since maybe the one in “Gone 
Girl” — and someone was literally 
murdered in that scene. We’re 
supposed to believe their love is 
strong enough for both of them to 
risk their entire families and homes 
for each other, but I don’t buy it for 
a second.

But perhaps the most offensive 

thing about “A United Kingdom” 
is the fact that it’s simply littered 
with “Good White People.” In fact, 
the white people are so good that 
most of the actual intolerance we 
see is on the part of the citizens of 
Bechuanaland towards Ruth. It’s 
really baffling for a movie that is 
quite literally about colonialism 
to frame her as the victim of some 
sort of nonsense reverse racism. 
The white disgust for Seretse and 
Ruth’s relationship is only spoken 
of, hinted even — but never shown.

I really wanted this movie to 

be excellent. It’s about genuinely 
important, 
groundbreaking 

people who made a significant 
impact on the world. They 
deserve to have their story 
told, and told well. They didn’t 
deserve a schmaltzy, feel-good, 
watered down version of what 
happened, too boring to be a 
good love story, and too scared 
of offending anyone to be a 
thoughtful meditation on the 
history. It leaves the viewer 
neither empowered nor inspired 
nor angered. “A United Kingdom” 
makes you feel nothing at all.

In final season, Christner sheds the pressure

Between 
innings 
against 

Arizona State on Feb. 26, the 
Michigan 
softball 
Twitter 

account posted a video of senior 
centerfielder Kelly Christner 
gathered around her fellow 
outfielders, 
dancing 
to 
Pat 

Benatar’s 1983 hit, “Love is a 
Battlefield.”

It was the final day of an 

arduous five-game Mary Nutter 
Classic, and time had just 
snatched a possible win against 
No. 1 Florida State away from 
the Wolverines. A drop-dead 
travel rule was imposed in the 
middle of the eighth inning — 
just as Michigan had its chance 
to score a runner from second 
and avenge its eliminating loss 
to the Seminoles from the 2016 
Women’s College World Series.

Visible 
frustration 
and 

disappointment would have been 
justified to see from the trio of 
outfielders before the final inning.

Yet, there was Christner, 

waiting for the song’s piano 
notes to cascade from the field’s 
speakers. When they did, she 
threw her arms up dramatically 
and turned around at the 
camera behind her, cracking up 
her teammates.

“I looked like an idiot,” 

Christner said. “But it’s just 
little stuff like that to try to 
loosen everyone up.”

But Christner hasn’t always 

been able to carry that relaxing 
sense of humor on the field.

***

It’s the second game of the 

2016 WCWS, and Michigan 
is down by a run to No. 3 
Oklahoma. Christner steps up 
to the plate with two outs and 
the bases loaded.

The pressure mounted — she 

could drive in a game-tying 
or go-ahead run. She takes 
two balls before taking a pitch 
down the heart of the plate and 
pulling another foul, evening 
the count at two. The fifth pitch 
of the at-bat is fired home and 
curves away from Christner, 
nipping the black of the plate. 
She never pulled the trigger, as 

the voice behind her screams 
“strike-three.” 
Christner’s 

frustration is apparent as she 
turns to the umpire, arguing 
the call with just a dejected 
look on her face. 

Michigan would never get 

that 
game-

tying 
run, 

losing its first 
contest 
in 

Oklahoma City 
before 
getting 

eliminated 
a 

day later.

***

This season, 

however, 
Christner 
has 

pulled 
the 

trigger on that powerful sense 
of humor.

It comes — just as her game 

does — from years of practice 
with her older sister, Katie, who 
played softball at Wisconsin 
from 2013 to 2016.

“Both of us like to have fun,” 

Katie said. “You can always 
see both of us dancing before 
games, and doing things and 
doing funny, weird stuff to 
make our teammates laugh.”

The Christner sisters grew 

up under the tutelage of their 
dad, a former college baseball 
player at Cornell. Their love 
of softball dominated their 
childhood, 
creating 
shared 

afternoons in the cage and on 
the diamond.

As they grew up with a love 

for softball, with countless 
teams, practices and days on 
the diamond between them, 
the logical college decision 
for Christner might have been 
Wisconsin, where she would 
get to play with her sister 
for three years. A visit to 
Michigan, though, persuaded 
her otherwise.

“The first time Kelly went 

to Ann Arbor, she fell in love 
with (Michigan) and its softball 
culture,” Katie said. “Even 
though we’re so close and she 
would’ve liked to have gone to 
school with me, visiting sealed 
it for her.”

Added Christner: “It would 

have been so much fun to have 

her at college with me, but I 
wanted to take her out of the 
equation and make the decision 
based 
upon 
every 
other 

factor. When I did that, it was 
Michigan all the way.”

Still, the two found playing 

one another in the 
Big Ten schedule 
quite difficult.

“One 
of 
the 

weirdest 
things 

I’ve 
ever 
gone 

through is seeing 
her on the other 
side,” Katie said.

Perhaps 
the 

time away from 
her sister drew 
Christner further 

from that enjoyment brought 
by those afternoons on the 
diamond with their father.

Though 
there’s 
no 
way 

to know for sure, one thing 
is certain: that bond from 
childhood has become vital 
to 
Christner’s 
senior-year 

resurgence. Her older sister’s 
perspective 
and 
words 
of 

wisdom have given her the 
necessary mindset to start the 
season so strongly, with less of 
an emphasis on statistics.

“My sister told me: nobody 

asked what her batting average 
was, but they ask how it made 
(her) into a better person,” 
Christner said. “So, I think all 
of us have tried to focus on that, 
working on letting (softball) 
make us better people.”

But in case anyone does 

ask Christner what better in 
college — partially thanks to 
her sister’s advice — she’ll 
be able to give them a damn 
impressive answer.

***

Christner and fellow seniors 

Megan Betsa, Abby Ramirez 
and Lindsay Montemarano all 
live together in an off-campus 
house — just as they have since 
their sophomore seasons. On 
the field, they have experienced 
two runs to the WCWS and 
three Big Ten championships. 
Off it, friendships and life-long 
bonds have strengthened like 
an aluminum bat cooling from a 
molding fire.

“A lot of people think we 

get sick of each other because 
we’re literally with one another 
24/7,” Christner said. “But 
we’ve gotten to know each 
other so well now that we know 
how to handle one another in 
certain situations. I think that 
helped on the softball field and 
helped us come even closer 
together.”

The roommates have learned 

each other’s quirks — Christner 
knows “almost every song” or 
the story behind Ramirez’s 
walk-up track, “Gasolina.”

But the willingness to speak 

bluntly is one of the first things 
her teammates will concede 
about Christner’s personality. 

“She’ll 
tell 
you 
how 
it 

is,” Betsa said. “She doesn’t 
sugarcoat things, so you don’t 
have to worry about that.”

As her senior year progresses 

and Christner continues to 
pick her spots to be blunt, 
she’s 
forced 
to 
reflect 
on 

her career. And having gone 
through a final season herself, 
Katie knows exactly what will 
become most nostalgic for her 
sister.

“I think she’ll miss the fun 

times with her teammates the 
most on and off the field,” she 
said. “The bus trips — and 
everything that doesn’t look 
too enjoyable on the surface — 
you realize were fun.”

Maybe her three senior 

housemates were the perfect 
catalyst to help her remember 
that this season, following a 
year in which the fun had 
escaped Christner entirely.

After Christner broke 

out to hit .393 with 21 
home runs and 67 runs 
batted her sophomore 
season, the accolades — 
including All-American 
honors, 
a 
place 
on 

the All-Big Ten First 
Team, and a nod for 
NCAA all-tournament 
team — piled as high 
as 
expectations 

for the next year. 
And 
following 
a 

national 
runner’s 

up finish and a 

return of a plethora of key 
players, the pressure stacked 
upon Christner and the rest of 
the Wolverines in 2015.

But the stress of reliving a 

breakout season affected her, as 
a focus on matching statistical 
benchmarks 
backfired. 

Christner’s average dropped 
80 points, and she hit just six 
home runs in her junior season.

“I think she put a lot of 

pressure 
on 
herself,” 
said 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“You feel like you’re supposed 
to be hitting .400, hitting home 
runs, and be an All-American. 
And she allowed that to build 
into the expectations.”

Added 
Christner: 
“This 

past summer, I looked at my 
sophomore year to junior year, 
and I saw obvious mistakes 
that I made last year. So this 
summer, I really worked on 
getting back to that swing I had 
sophomore year.”

With her sister’s advance and 

swing 
new 
changes, 

2017 
has 

been a renaissance of sorts for 
the senior. Twenty-two games 
into the year, Christner is 
hitting .476 with for home runs 
and 22 runs batted in — on-pace 
for the team’s triple crown.

“I think it’s hard to watch 

anyone struggle,” Megan Betsa 
said. “You want to see them do 
well but can’t do it for them. 
She did a good job working 
through it, as you can see her 
performance now.”

***

Fast-forward 
to 
that 

Mary 
Nutter 
Classic 
last 

February. The Wolverines find 
themselves in a similar position 
— down in the latter innings — 
against an inferior team in New 
Mexico State. A loss could have 
had demoralizing effects. With 
runners on first and second and 
Michigan trailing by two runs, 
Christner makes a return to the 
plate. 

But this time, she remembers 

the joy of playing softball 
— the type she felt on 
the empty Illinois field 
with her sister and dad 
— and she ignores the 
pressure.

The 
pitch 
comes 

toward 
home. 

Christner 
picks 

the bat off her left 
shoulder and takes 
an aggressive cut. 
The softball blasts 
through 
the 
air 

and 
clears 
the 

fence, giving the 
Wolverines a lead 
they 
wouldn’t 

relinquish.

Kelly 

Christner 
is 

just 
playing 

softball 
now 

— maybe more 
dancing 
in 

centerfield 
has 
its 

rewards.

“I needed 

to just have 
more 
fun 

with 
it,” 

she 
said. 

“It is just a 
game.”

The risk Michigan took

M

ichigan junior right-
hander Tera Blanco 
struck out the final 

batter of the game Saturday 
against Kent State, capping 
off a complete-game, two-hit, 
13-strikeout masterpiece. If that 
wasn’t enough, Blanco helped 
her own cause, knocking in 
three runs with the bat en route 
to a 5-1 win for the 19th-ranked 
Wolverines. 

The outing was what her 

season was supposed to look 
like.

For a team that came into 

the season with question marks 
throughout its lineup and in 
search of pitching depth, Blanco 
represented a rare opportunity 
to provide stability in both 
areas. 

So far, Blanco has struggled to 

juggle the extra responsibility, 
serving as an example of her 
entire team’s issues.

“It’s a lot to handle mentally, 

probably, I think that’s the 
biggest thing,” Blanco said. “Just 
controlling your mind, and just 
relaxing, taking one pitch at a 
time. That’s how I deal with it.”

As a stalwart in the middle 

of the order for last season’s 
offensive juggernaut, Blanco’s 
production ballooned, as she 
posted a .404 batting average, 
with a slugging percentage 
(.748) and home run total (12) 
that trailed only the legendary 
Sierra Romero for best on 
the team. She was a key cog, 
instrumental to the offensive 
success of a team that made it 
to the Women’s College World 
Series.

An experienced, productive 

hitter, Blanco seemed set to 
match or exceed her strong 
production from a year ago, and 
provide a stabilizing force in the 
middle of the Wolverines’ order 
that lost much of its veteran 
presence. But last season is long 

in the rearview mirror — the 
Wolverines already equaled 
their loss total (seven) from 
the entire 2016 season — and 
as Blanco continues to learn, 
past success does not guarantee 
future production.

She now sports a .218 batting 

average and managed just two 
extra-base hits over the first 22 
games, prompting a demotion 
in the lineup as Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins tries to find 
her spark from last season. 
Blanco’s on-base plus slugging 
(OPS) sits at a startlingly low 
.688, nearly half the number 
she posted in her breakout 
sophomore campaign (1.285). 
It’s a small sample size, and 
Blanco could very well turn her 
season around at the plate going 
forward.

But maybe we should have 

seen this coming. 

Blanco thrived last season in 

her specialized role: playing first 
base and hitting behind some 
of the best players in program 
history. She pitched on occasion 
— amassing a total of just 29.1 
innings in mostly low-pressure 
situations. 

This season, with the 

graduation of right-hander Sara 
Driesenga, Hutchins slotted 
Blanco into the second spot 
in the rotation, in addition to 
her regular position at first 
base. Given her pedigree as a 
top pitching recruit — ranked 
the No. 1 pitcher in 2013 in 
the softball hotbed of Orange 
County, Calif., according to the 
Orange County Register — the 
move seemed natural. 

And in the beginning of the 

season, the extra responsibility 
didn’t concern Hutchins.

“I don’t think (pitching and 

the loss of offensive production) 
has to go hand-in-hand,” 
Hutchins said at her season-
opening press conference. “Tera 
improved last year. She spent 
most of the preseason pitching, 
but she was first-team All-
American because of her bat. … 
Tera’s definitely a gamer.”

In retrospect, though, 

expecting her to match 
Driesenga’s 130-plus innings 
with an earned run average 
near two, while still producing 
offensively at the same rate, may 
have been naive.

To her credit, Blanco has 

undoubtedly matched, or even 
exceeded, expectations on 
the mound. With an ERA of 
2.08, she continues to provide 
a compliment to senior right-
hander Megan Betsa to create 
a formidable rotation that has 
become this team’s strongsuit. 
Her efforts this past weekend 
even earned her the Big Ten 
Pitcher of the Week Award.

But the offense — which has 

mustered just 1.8 runs per game 
against nine ranked opponents 
this season — misses her bat 
dearly, which has shown few 
signs of life in the beginning of 
the season. Perhaps that’s just 
an inherent consequence of 
Blanco’s expanded role.

Fortunately for the Michigan 

softball team, the story of 
the 2017 season has yet to be 
written — nor will it be written 
for awhile. But it seems hard to 
imagine a happy ending to that 
narrative without an offensive 
rejuvenation from Tera Blanco.

That’s no easy task, and the 

road forward won’t be any 
easier on the right-hander. 
There is a certain attention to 
detail incumbent upon starting 
pitchers — scouting opposing 
lineups, mixing pitch selection, 
recalling past at-bats, etc. — 
that can inevitably be mentally 
consuming. When combining 
that with hitting in the lineup 
on a regular basis, you invite the 
danger of spreading a player’s 
talents thin. Sometimes being a 
“gamer” isn’t enough.

That was a risk the 

Wolverines were willing to take.

Now they’re paying the price 

for it.

A breakdown of the Big Ten race

Last 
season, 
the 
Michigan 

softball team clinched its ninth-
straight Big Ten title after playing 
like the top team in the conference 
all season long. 

This 
season, 
though, 
is 
a 

different 
story 
for 
the 
now 

nineteenth-ranked 
Wolverines 

(14-7-1). Michigan no longer looks 
like the dominant Big Ten team. 
Not only is a 10th-straight title 
not a shoo-in for the Wolverines, 
but Minnesota — who edged 
out Michigan, 4-3, for the 2016 
tournament 
championship 
— 

appears to be the front runner for 
the conference crown this year.

Michigan’s 
first 
encounter 

with rival Minnesota — the 
only higher-ranked team in the 
conference — won’t be until the 
Big Ten Tournament in May, so the 
Wolverines will have ample time to 
improve.

Last season during conference 

play, the Wolverines were upset by 
both Northwestern and Nebraska. 
While those losses did not prevent 
Michigan from taking its 19th 
conference title, Minnesota is 
better than ever, and the team with 
the ability to generate offensive 
production against both strong 
opponents and smaller teams — an 
element the Wolverines have had 
problems with so far — will be able 
to come out on top this year.

The Daily broke down the teams 

that have the opportunity to make 
waves in Big Ten play and compete 
for the conference title this season.

No. 8 Minnesota (22-2)
Though it may get cold in 

Minnesota, the Golden Gophers 
don’t seem to be cooling down 
anytime soon.

With an elite .341 batting 

average, Minnesota ranks first in 
the conference and has collected 
227 hits over its 24 games played. 
The Golden Gophers return ace 
right-hander Sara Groenewegen, 
who boasts a 0.71 earned-run 
average — the best of any Big Ten 
hurler.

Minnesota’s skills aren’t just 

limited to the circle, however, with 
powerhouse 
infielders 
Maddie 

Houlihan, Sydney Dwyer and 
MaKenna Partain leading the 
way in the batter’s box. Houlihan 
earned Big Ten freshman of the 
year honors last season and posted 
a .464 batting average during 
conference play. Dwyer currently 
leads the Big Ten in runs batted in 
with 32 and bats a commanding 
.417, while Partain sports the 
second-highest batting average in 
the conference at .486. 

Early season highlights for 

Minnesota 
include 
overtaking 

No. 13 Louisiana State University 
(3-0), demonstrating the Golden 
Gophers’ ability to hold their own 
against other ranked opponents — 
an area in which the Wolverines 
have struggled. 

If its performance so far is any 

indication, Minnesota looks to 
have the tools to compete for a 
Women’s College World Series 
berth and holds the biggest 
threat to Michigan’s quest for a 
10th-consecutive conference title.

No. 24 Wisconsin (20-2)
Riding a hot 11-game win 

streak, 
Wisconsin 
should 
not 

be 
underestimated 
entering 

conference play, boasting its best 
start in program history and 
earning 
a 
USA 
Today/NFCA 

Coaches top-25 ranking as of this 
week.

The team that lost to Indiana in 

the first round of last year’s Big Ten 
Tournament appears dramatically 
improved. So far, the Badgers have 
suffered just two losses, one of 
which to No. 12 James Madison. 

Wisconsin is blessed with a key 

element that many Big Ten teams 
lack: pitching depth. Right-handers 
Kirsten Stevens and Kaitlyn Menz 
post the second and third best 
ERAs in the conference, 0.77 and 
1.41, respectively. Though only 
a freshman, Menz has seen 13 
starting appearances in the circle.

Utility player Chloe Miller 

leads her team and conference 
in multiple offensive categories, 
including a batting average with a 
.543 clip and hits with 38. 

Michigan State (15-7)

Michigan State, one of the 

lowest seeds heading into the 
Big Ten Tournament last season, 
now claims the second-highest 
batting average in the conference 
at .337 heading into Big Ten 
play. Individually, outfielder Lea 
Foerster and utility player Kaitlyn 
Eveland post top-10 conference 
batting averages, with .457 and 
.420 clips, respectively.

However, the Spartans have 

serious concerns in the circle with 
a 4.43 ERA — one of the highest in 
the conference — which is likely 
to hurt Michigan State when it 
faces conference opponents with 
powerhouse hitters. 

Illinois (12-7)
Illinois is off to a strong start this 

season, with a winning record and 
a majority of its seven losses coming 
at the hands of ranked opponents.

Minnesota knocked the Illini 

out of the Big Ten Tournament in 
the second round last year, after 
sitting in the middle section of the 
conference throughout the season.

This season, though, Illinois has 

already shown its promising future 
at the top of the standings, sporting 
the fourth-best batting average at 
.320, the fifth-best ERA of 3.29 and 
the second-best fielding percentage 
of .974 in the conference.

Ohio State (10-6)
Ohio 
State’s 
pre-conference 

performance has been marred 
with inconsistency, with tough 
losses to ranked opponents as well 
as lopsided victories, often splitting 
games against the same team.

While the Buckeyes sit around 

the upper quartile of the Big Ten 
offensively with a .293 batting 
average, they really thrive in the 
circle, ranking third with a 2.21 
ERA due to right-handers Shelby 
Hursh and Lena Springer. The 
pitching duo sport the fourth and 
seventh best conference ERAs of 
1.53 and 2.24, respectively.

If Ohio State can foster greater 

offensive production from players 
other than outfielder Alex Bayne, 
who is tied atop the conference 
with seven home runs, it will have 
a chance to compete with the top of 
the Big Ten.

My whole life I had been told
That there was but one substrate I could hold
A substrate in every way perfect for me
Together an enzyme-substrate complex we would be
 
Oh how I dreamt of her every night
Desperate to fill the void in my active site
For a time I didn’t mind the wait
Knowing somewhere out there was my structural mate
 
But time grew cruel, and I began to question my conformation
Was it possible that mine was a mutation
What if there was no product for this reaction
No substrate with whom I could share my attraction
 
Was mine a lineage without nomenclature
One destined for a slow denature
 
I had been burned before
A competitive inhibitor known only as whore
She’d taken my active site
For which she had no reason but spite
 
My faith was waning,
My beta pleats tired from straining
But then I remembered what my RNA had said
Perhaps I wasn’t better off dead
 
See he had told me of a way to adapt
A way to harness my potential that remained untapped
All I needed was to induce a fit
I could find another substrate to permit
 
And so I did, a dazzling 6 carbon carbohydrate
Though she could easily have been an eight
Like a lock and key we meshed
I’d never felt so blessed
 
Yet as quickly as she had come, she left
Leaving behind an empty cleft
I was devastated until I saw
A grand sucrose without a flaw
 
I soon learned, that together glucose and me
Had created something of a larger degree
Our love had given the world a disaccharide
And I couldn’t feel a thing but pride
 

Love I had learned was fleeting
But with a little heating
It would find me again soon
Another substrate to make swoon

I am a scientist.
I believe in method and procedure.
I only see what is in front of me.
I draw conclusions upon proof.
Science has given me reason.
 
There is a rule in science:
Three trials make your findings significant,
For someone to acknowledge that your attempts have meaning.
I have known this rule since I can remember.
But I look back,
And I remember that you have broken my heart four times.
Four times I have had you and lost you.
It happened once, twice, three times, and then four.
You have destroyed me from the inside out.
There has been cause and effect.
I have seen it with my own eyes,
I have felt every vessel in my heart get torn by you.
 
I have learned
That science does not apply to love.
That science is for the real world.
And that love—
Well love doesn’t exist in the mind where science lies.
Love is not made by the brain.
Love is not the set of chemical reactions I have learned it is.
Love is waking up every day
Desperate for a fifth trial.

And in that moment I was a tiger,
my prey’s blood matted into my fur
as I carried you, dangling between
carved fangs, afraid and afraid.
 
The days passed maliciously since our lips
had met in comfort; but here I was deafened
and defeated by the way you stroked my hair,
fingers braided into tangles and knots.
 
And in that moment I was a tiger,
and I kissed the earth and her leaves.
the greens dissolved on my tongue,
the meat and the veins as they fell from the sky
 quivering at my sight.
 
Spirituality sang in cycles, drifting
and wavering. Excuses always came easy to us.
We left each other in favor of a silicone
meditation, where thoughts ran endlessly
and affectionate rivers dry.
 
But in that moment I was a tiger,
and I danced to the jungle’s songs,
a humming rhythm as you fell into my grasp;
limb by limb, consumed.
 
Fugitive, you said from between my teeth.
 my tiger teeth.
 
And in that moment I loved
And in that moment I loved
And in that moment I loved.

Gaze

In a place of space

BY ZOYA GURM, LSA Freshman

ILLUSTRATION BY
CAROLINE KIM, LSA Junior

BY MILES GROFSOREAN, LSA Senior

He went to fill the space again once more,
Noticing there was more room than before;
 
The light was gone that made his life so keen,
Before the boy had reached the hollow scene.
 
He stretched his hands as far as they would go,
He threw his love as far as he could throw;
 
But she had gone her way beyond his gaze,
And he was left to drift under a daze.
 
“All must be,” he cried within his heart,
“Whether they live together or apart.”
 
The thought of life and death seemed all the same,
Once he had acquiesced, and laid his claim,
 
And more so contrasts between nil and naught,
Seemed to be more worthy of his thought.
 
But before he could plunge into the dark,
It caught his hand and showed what it had marked
 
Forth from its depths the planets did expand,
A bounty more than any could demand;
 
Of beasts and fish and birds, the day and night,
Of love and hate and peace, the dark and light.
 
She cupped his cheeks, and brought his eyes to hers,
To bear witness. Suddenly, in a blur
 
The herald of the void at once let go
Of his hand and quickly started to grow
 
On and on, this way and that, ‘twas obscene!
Till only space between her dust was seen.
 
But when the boy looked up and fixed his eyes,
He saw her glittering ash adorn the sky;
 
Her spirit thusly kindred to the stars,
Felt almost as near as it did afar.
 
And so it was that she led him to see,
He too was from the nothingness as she;
 
A truth that shook his being to the bone,
So that he would no longer walk alone.
 
“All must be,” the boy hummed in his heart,
“Whether they live together or apart.”

A Peculiar Love for Nuts

a short ficton story

b y B e n R a p p o p o r t, LSA Freshman
J

ames Jameson? Yeah, I know him. He 

works with me at the office. Gotta feel 

bad for a guy with a name like that; his 

parents must have hated him. I think 

he runs numbers for the guys upstairs. I guess 

management thinks he’s hot shit or something. A 

while ago he threatened to quit unless he got a 

promotion. They gave him an intern who gets his 

coffee once a week, and that shut him right up.

Yeah, I’d say James has always been a little bit 

nutty. No pun intended. A real nut case, ha. You 

can sorta pick up on that just from talking to him. 

He had these … mannerisms. One is this twitch 

in his eye. He’ll be talking to you and then he 

just starts winking at you. First time it happened 

to me I thought he was coming on to me. I said 

nuh-uh, sir. There’s nothing wrong with that way 

of life, but that’s just not the book I’m reading if 

you get what I mean. Later I found out about his 

twitch from someone at the watercooler, and I 

felt kinda bad about the way I acted. I came by 

his cubicle to be polite and to welcome him to 

the office and did a sort of half-assed knock on 

the wall with my third and fourth knuckles. He 

looked up from his computer, and that’s when 

I discovered his second mannerism. He had a 

mouthful of nuts — I mean full to the brim. He 

looked like a goddamn squirrel stocking up for a 

long-ass winter, “Day After Tomorrow” shit, you 

know what I’m saying? He had another fistful of 

nuts ready to pop in as soon as he was done with 

the current set. Pistachios, cashews, almonds, 

peanuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts 

overflowing out of his lanky, crooked fingers — 

I could tell this man loved his nuts, but I didn’t 

realize just how much he loved nuts. How could 

I? You see a man with a face and fist full of nuts 

you just think, damn, this guy really likes nuts, 

then you move on with your life; that’s just what 

you do.

My office had a window. I thought I made it 

big: my own office, my own window, my own 

door with my own name on it. Then one day, 

this GODdamn bird flies into my office through 

my open window — it was such a nice day, I had 

to open the window — and it trashes my whole 

office. This two-pound ball of shit and feathers 

slammed into all of the family pictures that I had 

just hung on the walls — shattered the glass. It 

knocked over my computer monitor, scratched 

my nice leather office chair that I bought with 

my own money, and took a fat-fucking shit on my 

desk. Then it flew back outside like nothing even 

happened — like it coulda popped out any time it 

wanted to — like it just flew into my room to shit 

on my desk and ruin my day. Management made 

me move out of my office for two weeks so some 

fed dipshits in hazmat suits could kick it in there 

for a few hours and come out each day claiming 

that my office is “uninhabitable due to the pos-

sibility of the excrement contaminating the air 

with a viral disease” or some shit. I don’t know 

why they couldn’t just spray some Lysol up in 

there and call it — probably too tantalized by the 

fat government check cushioning their wallets.

As it turns out, I later found out from Biff (he’s 

got the office next to mine) that Jameson had been 

by my office earlier that day looking for me — that 

he’d come by with his fistful of nuts and poked his 

head in my door, and when he hadn’t found me he 

stuck his head in Biff’s door and asked where I 

was. Don’t know what he needed me for. Biff said 

the guy just wanted to see me. Anyway, Biff told 

me he suspects that James dropped a few nuts 

in my room when he did poke in, cos that’s what 

he did in Biff’s office, and a bird musta seen the 

nuts through my open window or something and 

decide to come and get a snack. Well sure enough 

I found a few cashews lying by my door when I 

was finally let back into my own office.

Till then though, I had to work in a cubicle 

that shared a wall with Jameson’s. That was just 

great. Obviously I was still bitter about the nuts 

he left in my office, but what am I gonna do, bully 

the new guy? During those two weeks, I saw 

James every single day. Every day when I’d get 

up from my cubicle to go to the watercooler I’d 

peek at him when I walk by, not in a spying sorta 

way, but a curious sorta way, and every time he’d 

have his mouth full of nuts and a fistful waiting 

its turn. When I’d get up to go to the bathroom, 

mouthful and fistful. When I’d go to lunch, fist-

ful and mouthful. He must have gone through at 

least a pound a day.

Though on the fourth day — maybe it was the 

fifth — I walked by his cubicle and this time he 

wasn’t munching his nuts. This time he only had 

one nut in his hand (an almond I’m pretty sure) 

and he was holding it up like so, like he’s trying 

to suffocate the tiny thing with his thumb; and 

he was holding it up to his ear and squinting his 

eyes like he was dead-ass focused on something. 

I thought what a weirdo and got on with my life; 

that’s just what you do. Some people are into 

weird-ass shit; you just gotta carry on.

He wasn’t holding it anymore when I got back 

to my desk. He wasn’t munching his nuts either.

Here’s where this shit started turning into 

a real chin-scratcher. The first time I actually 

wondered if Jameson had fallen off his rocker 

was when I heard him murmuring through the 

cubicle wall — those things ain’t soundproof 

for shit. Now that in and of itself wasn’t that 

weird. You know, I get it. Some people talk to 

themselves when they’re working — helps their 

train of thought or whatever. My wife, she does 

it when she’s especially stressed; that’s how I 

know when to order pizza for dinner. Anyway, 

I hear him murmur and mumble and it starts to 

grind my gears after a while. I’m about to put on 

my headphones just to block it out but not with-

out walking past his cubicle and shooting him a 

dirty look so he knows what’s up — I’m petty like 

that. I walk up to his cubicle and set the nastiest 

look on my face — my mom used to tell me not 

to make faces or they’ll get stuck; if my face had 

gotten stuck right then I’d have been screwed — 

then when I come around the corner, I see James 

holding the almond in the palm of his hand right 

up close to his face. He doesn’t seem to notice 

me standing there staring at him — he’s too busy 

whispering sweet-fucking-nothings to this nut. I 

swear to God, I’m telling you, this is some weird-

ass shit. I didn’t know what to say; I didn’t say 

anything. I walked back to my cubicle and sat 

my ass down, put my headphones in and went on 

with my life. Cos that’s what you do, right? None 

of my business.

I shoulda kept thinking about it like that: 

“none of my business.” Curiosity killed the cat, 

they say. I wish I’d forgotten all about it and 

never looked into his cubicle again. The very next 

day, I walked by his cubicle, and I just glanced 

over my shoulder and James — I swear, you can’t 

make this shit up, I swear to fucking God you 

can’t — James is holding this exact same almond 

to his lips, puckered like a fish. Now if I didn’t 

know any better, I’d think he was just kissing this 

nut. Crazy, right? Batshit! He caught me looking 

though. He dropped the nut like it just burnt him 

or something and he turned hot red. He didn’t say 

anything though. I didn’t say nothing either; just 

walked on by. But tell me, how the hell am I sup-

posed to just move on from that shit? I couldn’t 

help myself from thinking: was Jameson just 

kissing a fucking nut?

You can’t tell me that I needed to get over it — 

just don’t think about it, right? How could I not 

think about that? I kept thinking about it after I 

went home. My wife was talking to herself that 

night, but I didn’t order pizza. I just couldn’t stop 

thinking about what the hell happened in the 

office that day. Sherry got mad at me — that’s my 

wife — guess she wanted me to order pizza or ask 

her about her day or whatever it is women want; I 

don’t know. I wasn’t really listening.

I spent a lot of time at the watercooler the 

next day, mostly because I couldn’t focus on my 

work, but also because I wanted to avoid see-

ing James do any weirder shit. A few of my co-

workers stopped by to take a break, and I chatted 

with them. I asked the usual shit like, “How’s the 

wife,” even though I didn’t care and what’s the 

weather look like for tomorrow even though I 

already knew. What I really wanted to know was 

if anyone else picked up on James acting strange 

lately, but nobody seemed to notice anything dif-

ferent about him. I didn’t bring up the nut thing; 

I didn’t want them to think I was the crazy one.

I had half a week left in this cruddy cubicle 

next to James, and dammit I needed to figure out 

just what the hell it was that he was up to. Last 

few days, I remember, he’d starting eating lunch 

in his cubicle, but he stopped eating nuts. I saw 

him eating salads, sandwiches, spaghetti — nor-

mal shit. Maybe he pulled himself together, I 

thought at one point. Maybe it was just a phase — 

an adjustment period. I invited him out to lunch 

one of those days, told him I knew this great deli 

that had just opened down the block; they’ve got 

this apple-brie melt that’ll make your heart melt. I was hoping that 

we’d talk over lunch and that he’d say normal shit, and I’d be like 

damn I was wrong, he’s no weirdo after all.

Turns out, I was wrong about being wrong. I asked him to 

lunch, but he politely declined, saying he already had made plans 

for a lunch date today, and maybe we could go some other time. 

Whatever, that’s fine. It was just a gesture anyway. Except, when 

I walked by again in an hour, I saw him eating a plate of pasta, 

two forks on the plate. Across the plate, he — I kid you not — he 

put that same almond on this, this chair that he made out of a 

cotton ball and a tissue. He was on a lunch date with an almond. 

Lemme say that again, a lunch date with a fucking almond. I went 

home from work early that day — told my boss I was feeling sick 

and I wasn’t lying. Felt sick in the head for the rest of the day. 

Barely said two words to Sherry that night, even. I think she went 

out and got pizza by herself. Not sure; I went to bed early. When I 

came back to work the next morning, James said “morning” and I 

gave him this half-assed smile ‘cause I had nothing to say to him. 

A little while later though, I’ll admit, I came around the corner 

and asked how his date went. He smiled this toothy smile like 

he’d been with Olivia Wilde and she was all over him. “I think 

I’m in love, Michael.”

I got an invitation in the mail three days later. You wanna 

know what it said?

James Jameson

&

Almonda Nutt

Cordially request the pleasure of your company on the joyous 

occasion of their marriage.

Now picture me going through my mail: bill, catalogue, ad, bill, 

ad, almond wedding invitation. At this point I don’t even know 

what’s going on. This nut is getting married … to an almond. Is 

that legal? How did he even find an officiant who’d agree to do 

that? Is this not concerning to anybody else? Is he planning on 

having kids with this lady? Has he met her parents? How are they 

going to have sex on their honeymoon? If they don’t have sex will 

their marriage be consummated? How are they supposed to have 

sex?

What? Of course I went. How many times in my life am I going 

to have the chance to see a man get married to a nut? Jameson’s 

guests all had this look — some combination of pity and concern 

— not the kind of look you’d want your wedding guests to have. 

Almonda’s guests were all nuts; not sure what I expected there. 

The usher carried a bowl of mixed nuts with him and placed each 

one in a seat. Jameson’s vows were heartfelt; I’ll give it to the 

guy, he honest to God cares very deeply about his bride. He talked 

about how he had always turned to nuts in times of hunger and 

boredom, that is, until he met Almonda. She opened his eyes to 

see that eating nuts is wrong, and she showed him how to love. A 

guest from James’ side was sniveling audibly by the end of it. The 

minister’s invitation for Almonda to share her vows was met with 

silence. Somebody coughed and then they were pronounced 

husband and wife.

I’ll be damned if the couple’s first dance wasn’t the sweetest 

strange thing I’ve ever seen. James was just beaming as he held 

onto his wife and swung her around in the spotlight. After din-

ner, I spied James trying to feed Almonda a piece of cake. He was 

failing of course, but it was kind of cute. And he was happy.

Me and Sherry were sitting at a table with some of my co-work-

ers and their wives. I remember Rob’s wife cooing about how cute 

the newlyweds looked together, then she asked Rob if he remem-

bered their wedding night and how in love they were.

Sherry wasn’t having a good time that night. I asked her when 

we were alone for a second how she felt about the marriage and 

she made some comment about how ridiculous this whole thing 

is and a waste of money and peoples’ time. I don’t see it that way, 

but I guess I know where she’s coming from. I came to this wed-

ding feeling a bit like she did, but James was happy with his wife 

— dammit, happier than I am — and I don’t think it’s my place to 

look down on him for that. It’s a pity that Sherry can’t see it like 

that. After the wedding we went home and went to bed. Then the 

next morning the sun came up and we got on with our lives; that’s 

just what you do.

To the grandmother
in me
who rocks in
her chair
her bones
creak and she
still, frets.
Her knitting needles
scepters, pointers
of the getting
and fetching
and hurry
and less salt
please.
The grandmother in me
always asks
when will I bring
my boyfriend home
for thanksgiving
and when I do
she’ll forget to
set a place for
him because
passive aggression
is just her way.
When I am angry
full of exuberant
rage, the grandmother
in me is just
stern, her mouth in
a tight frown,
dentures cooling in
a bedside jar
because those who
“chomp gum so unladylike
are asking for it,”
she says.
She regards
my reluctance to
sunscreen as the
abominable sin
but refuses to
rub my back in
because she
finds my posture
unsatisfactory.

Ode to the Grandmother in Me

F 

eet shuffled across the courtyard, sneakers and flip 

flops and sandals against the scorching black pavement. 

Voices rose and fell periodically, calls of “Hey!” and 

“How was your summer?” rippling through the air. 

Hands reached out to tap shoulders, heads turned 

around in greeting, arms circled each other in hugs.

In the middle of it all, a girl stood alone. Her hands gripped the straps 

of her teal backpack. She turned her head from side to side, watching 

as kids talked about their camping trips and trips to Disney World and 

world-traveling to London or Paris or Barcelona.

The bell rang, and the students moved forward to the open doors, 

jostling the girl a little as she followed them into the belly of the beast, 

where she would have to navigate on her own through the unknown 

hallways and classrooms and students.

***

“OK, everyone, settle down, settle down.”

The kids all plopped down into their desks, watching their homeroom 

teacher for the new year, Ms. Smith, pull up the attendance sheet.

“Ah, it looks like we’ve got a new student this year!” She lifted the 

paper closer to her face, eyes squinting slightly as she adjusted her 

reading glasses.

The girl with the teal backpack gulped, already waiting for what was 

coming, what every new teacher she had at her old school went through.

“
Jee — Ji? — Ji yee own Lee?”

“It’s Jiyeon,” her voice squeaked, and everyone turned around to stare 

at her. She said it like Jee-yun. “But you can just call me Jen.”

“Ah, Jen! Much easier. Well, welcome to Brook Hills Middle School, 

Jen. I’m going to go through the rest of the attendance, so please let me 

know if anyone else wants to be called something different or have a 

nickname you’d like to be called.”

Jen slumped in her chair, taking a deep breath as Ms. Smith read 

through the list. Her face felt hot.

“OK! Now for some icebreakers. I want you all to turn to the person 

next to you and talk about something fun you did this summer.”

Jen turned to the boy to her right, who was wearing a New York 

Yankees hat. He pointed to the hat. “I went to a Yankees game this 

summer. It was really cool. My dad and I got to sit in like really close to 

the front probably like four rows away from the field, and Derek Jeter hit 

a homerun, and they won.”

“That’s cool,” Jen said. She didn’t know much about baseball, but she 

did know who the Yankees were. Everyone knew who the Yankees were, 

even her parents. “I went to summer camp at the YMCA for a few weeks 

this summer.”

“Cool,” he said, though to Jen it looked like he was still thinking about 

Derek Jeter’s home run. There was a pause. Then, “So where are you 

from?”

“Oh, I’m from a small town in Pennsylvania. It’s only a few hours 

away from here.”

The boy looked confused, his eyebrows scrunched together. “No, I 

mean, like, where are you actually from?”

Now it was Jen’s turn to be confused. “Like, in Pennsylvania?”

The boy threw his hands up in the air. “No, I mean like, in Asia. Like 

are you from China?”

“Oh,” Jen understood now. “I mean, I was born in Pennsylvania but 

my parents moved from South Korea two years before I was born.”

“Oh,” The boy said. They were both silent.

“OK! Looks like everyone’s done with the icebreaker.” Ms. Smith, 

thankfully, broke up the silence before it could grow any longer. “Make 

sure to meet back here every morning so we can take homeroom 

attendance.” The bell rang. “Have a good rest of the first day!”

***

The rest of Jen’s classes before lunch went basically the same way. 

Teachers and the trouble with her name, other students asking where 

she was really from, awkward silences. She couldn’t wait until lunch, so 

she could have a break from it all.

She went to her locker and pulled out her lunch box, a bright pink one 

to clash against her bright teal backpack.

The girl at the locker next to her turned to her and scrunched up her 

nose, making a face. “What is that smell?”

Jen could feel her cheeks getting hot again. “Oh, sorry — I think it 

might be from my lunch.”

The girl pinched her nose. “What could you possibly eat that would 

make it smell like that?”

Jen shrugged, throwing her lunchbox back into her locker and 

closing the door shut. “Maybe the heat’s making it smell like that,” she 

said, though she knew that wasn’t it.

The girl fanned the air in front of her face. “Well thank God you closed 

that locker door.” She walked away. Jen waited a few seconds before 

walking behind her, to the crowded cafeteria.

She found herself alone, again, in the middle of a crowded room, 

students passing her by with black trays filled with pizzas or hamburgers 

or salads, or kids clutching lunchboxes or brown paper bags. They all 

turned to glance at her and her lunch-less hands, but soon turned away 

to go find others to sit with.

A girl with curly brown hair came to her side. “You’re Jen, right? The 

new girl?”

Jen nodded. She didn’t trust herself to speak.

“Do you want to come sit with us?” She jerked her head toward a 

round table near the cafeteria doors, where three other girls sat, talking 

animatedly.

Jen felt a wave of relief course through her and nodded, smiling at the 

girl. “Yeah, that would be awesome.”

“Cool,” the girl smiled back, and they walked toward the table. “I’m 

Callie, by the way.”

“Nice to meet you, Callie,” she replied as they sat down at the table, 

the other girls looking at them.

“Everyone,” Callie announced, “this is Jen. She’s new and in my 

homeroom class. Jen, this is Mary, Leslie and Julia.”

“Hi,” Jen said, smiling at each of them.

“Where’s your lunch?” The girl called Leslie asked, taking a bite out 

of her pizza.

“Oh,” her stomach dropped. “I forgot it this morning. Almost missed 

the bus.”

“Aw, that really sucks,” Callie said. “You can have one of my cheese 

sticks if you want.” She held one out to her — the twisty kind that Jen 

always ate.

Her stomach grumbled, but she shook her head. “That’s OK, I can 

wait until after school.” She stopped for a beat, then remembered: 

“Thank you, though.”

***

“Hi, Jiyeon, how was your first day of school?” Her mother kissed her 

on the cheek as she plopped down to sit at the kitchen table, legs splayed 

out in front of her.

“It was OK,” she answered, rubbing her eyes. She heard her mom 

unzip her backpack, and before it was too late, she had already taken out 

her untouched lunch.

“What happened? Why didn’t you eat your lunch?” Her mother held 

the pink lunchbox out in front of her, dangling it like a cat’s toy.

Jen gulped. “Sorry. I wasn’t really that hungry.”

Her mother tsked. “Not eating on the first day! That’s bad for you. You 

must be so hungry now. Here, eat it.” She slid the lunchbox across the 

table.

Jen opened it up, feeling bad. She knew her mother woke up 

at six o’clock every morning — she did this at her other school — 

taking time to cook the rice to fluffy perfection, fold the kimchi 

into a different container (she liked to eat her foods separately), 

and pack it with a different kind of banchan — side dish — every 

day. She quickly ate the rice and kimchi, soothing her growling 

stomach.

“Did you meet some nice kids? Make any friends yet?”

Jen swallowed, the rice sticking a little too long in her throat. 

Images of the boy in the Yankee hat and the girl at the locker flew 

by in her mind. But she also remembered Callie.

“Sort of,” she said, chewing. “Yeah.”

Her mother nodded, kissing the top of her head. “That’s great 

to hear. Well, I’ve got to get back to work in my office. Call me if 

you need anything.”

Her mom left, and once she heard the front door close and 

the car’s engine rev and the wheels of her mom’s car skid out the 

driveway, she let her first tear fall.

Runs through the book is a dark poem

The black foot that throttle

Drinking

Grumbling

Brawling

Troubled brother who lived

At more intimately full rivers

Trout and flying fish

But more tragic death

The story brutal beating

His body left in a dark alley

About the family who loved him

But couldn’t save him

Haunted man being

Found the book published

When he was 73

Drawn from personal experience

In my family flying fish

Are spiritual dimensions

Communicating in disasters

He talks

About going to the river

Because he couldn’t stay anywhere else

Do you remember the last time you went fishing with your father?

Tears in his eyes

Drove up a road that spirals high above the river

We stopped

The Black Foot runs straight

Erupts

Rifles

Then slams into the mountain

After crawling to a deep hole

Repeats its cadence

Away in time

The book is written

To this rhythm

Finished my question

About father’s last fishing trip

He sat down

Tired

I could get you something

To drink for him

A drink

I fixed it

Didn’t taste good to him

Old fisher man

Silent in movement

He’ll never land

He was silent

Trout fishing

Learn

To

Read

The

Water

Cruising fish makes soft kiss

A rise

Beneath the surface

Rings mark

The soft kiss

Rise

O

n the once pearlescent edges of fleshy pink, there was decay, like that 

on the teeth of young boys and girls who dread nothing more than the 

taste of toothpaste. There was now a numbness where they had been 

filled with thought: the edges, consisting of those sensations of falling asleep or 

being woken up, now startled but unable to process.

“Are they in pain?” His wife looked at the lined hospital beds, each sectioned 

portion a more vibrant and clean white than the last.

“I don’t think so”, the doctor responded, his mask drawn up over his nose and 

lips. If anything, they are in the opposite, just numb and euphoric.

She walked home in a purplish haze. Her eyebrows were furrowed with worry; 

her husband was left there, that maze of pristine hallways that felt like a clean 

pair of dentures — mechanical, pretending to function like nature’s intention. 

Someone must come up with a word for that, the opposite of pain. I’ll ask him to 

think one up when he comes home. He’s felt it, anyway.

The more you try to filter your thoughts, the less filtered they become, as if it is 

the brain’s way to exert its dominance over itself, over its container of a body and 

the burdens that came with it. It’s an inconvenient thing, the universe. Why can’t 

it leave me to think? I have such endless capacity restricted by the time and place.

“The skies look less blue to people with tinted eyes”, she said, staring upward 

at violet clouds, violent delights. Her free hand pushed her black fringe from 

her olive-toned face, her other hand held blindly onto the idea of fate governing 

those numb minds, fixing the disease so carelessly described as Mother Nature’s 

anesthetic for the mind. It will be all right, she resolved.

The clouds in the skies were lightening to a lilac, more white brightening the 

gloomy blossoms.

Her mother had planted the seed of anxiety in her daughter when she gave 

birth. Could it have happened similarly to her husband? Maybe his father’s mind 

had faded at the edges, dead weight with the consistency of a well-used coffee 

filter. They had no way of knowing — he barely lived a breath past 30. But young 

men and old men are different — their bodies, their frames of mind, how could 

this have happened?

The clouds had lightened considerably since she had begun her walk, 

brightening the sky along with them. Birds with ravenesque colors and forms 

became visible; though they once swooped past her dizzied head unseen, they 

now soared in the sky as visibly as the sole light in a dark night. It had been quite 

a number, the bustle they moved in, uncomfortably exposed as their camouflage 

had been lifted.

She too felt exposed to an open field of spectators. She had heard all the 

questions — how did he lose his job, why couldn’t he function in the mechanical 

way he once had, why did his language turn so foul and his communication so 

weak? She had asked them herself. But now she had an answer, and it would 

inevitably circle through the community, who had excitedly watched the dark 

situation unfold as she lost her grip.

She wanted the sky to return to a deep and violent violet. She wanted to be 

engulfed by the heroic clouds, housing the least refreshing precipitation to grace 

the earth. She wanted to be up there, hidden in the wings of the raven birds. She 

wanted to be something else.

“I seldom have reason to feel anything but happiness”, she told the doctor, his 

mask drawn up to cover his nose and mouth. “Yet lately, I have been praying that 

my brain go numb as well. When she arrived back home she shut all the blinds, 

afraid of any small beam of light. She sat in a wooden arm chair and stared at 

the blankest wall. One of these days”, she thought as she buried herself in the 

plumage of a feather cushion, “one of my prayers will be answered.”

we could make beaches of the ashes

we burnt those summers.

 

ashes to ashes my sister told me

nothing was worth keeping,

don’t hoard memories or places

or people.

 

ashes to ashes the crematories rose

with white petals and thorny stems,

men with dark beards carrying them

between their teeth.

 

ashes to ashes my mother caressed

another child’s face. we lost the days we

grew up in, we lost the sock puppets that

covered our scorched fingers.

 

ashes to ashes piled up under clouds of

smoke with the consistency of milk,

at our feet and plastered to the skin, melted under

the heat of the real sun and our manmade one.

 

haunted beaches,

but beaches nonetheless.

If at some point we all succumb

For goodness sake, let us be young.

‘Cause time gets harder to outrun,

And I’m nobody, I’m not done.

-The Vaccines

 

I respect youth. I value it, fight it, fear it. Having completed only my first year of college, I’ve not been responsible for a career, a home, another person. I’ve 

never worried about angering a boss for fear of losing my job and my income. I’ve never worried about losing my home, failing my children. The only things I am 

responsible for at this stage in life is myself and my own future.

 

I possess vitality and exuberance (when I get enough sleep). I have the energy to go to class, then the gym, then to parties. I can stay awake through the night to 

write an essay. I can drink enough to drown most women of my stature and still function pretty well. I can do this for a few days in a row and still enjoy it. I have 

the opportunity to learn about anything — Buddhism, cells, the stock market. There are so many professors who want to teach me how to write or how to conduct 

research. I revel in the company of my friends, hoping that nights with them will be eternal, that naïve political debates and deep concern for the future of our 

civilization will never wilt. I desperately hope that I will always feel anger, nervousness, joy, and love as powerfully as I do now — love for friends, family, strangers. 

That I will continue to wake up most days with excitement.

 

And yet, I crave maturation. There sits within me a deep-rooted desire to fall in love. Instead of appreciating my independence and self-sufficiency — my 

opportunity to play by my own rules, to not worry about someone else’s reactions to my personality and choice — I search desperately for love. And while I search as 

if love would deliver me from suffering, I live a paradox. In the darkest recesses of my mind, I don’t resent this or any suffering. It will help me grow. And grow up.

 

Living in an apartment, I’ve started to understand what it’s like to have my own place. While the decision to live off campus was partly compelled by a desire to live 

with friends far away from security, I also wanted to learn to pay electric bills, cook my own meals, and clean my own house. I want to be responsible for something 

larger. I wanted to cultivate the feeling of being home away from my parents, and now I wonder what it would be like in a house where my friends are replaced by 

my children. I look forward to rising up a branch on the family tree (when / if I’m ready) and being shrouded in its foliage rather than hanging off of the lowest limb.

 

Again, I crave maturation. As a young person, I wish that my optimism would be appreciated rather than mocked. I wish that my thoughts and opinions would be 

taken seriously- that I would be respected for what experience I have and accepted for that which I do not.

 

Another paradox — I fear age. I fear that I will not be able to do all the things I want to do, say the things I want to say. There are so many people that I want to 

befriend, to love, and simply not enough time to do it all. I fear losing my optimism and my energy. I forever want to be able to socialize with my friends, get to know 

them more deeply, meet strangers. What happens when I start to discuss the weather with others more than I discuss life? What kind of identity will I possess then?

 

I fear that age will change me in unnatural ways, that I will lose myself — this self that I have worked so hard to cultivate and to love. I beg you — youth, age, be 

gentle with me.
