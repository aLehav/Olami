Dr. Robert Ernst, University 
Health 
Services 
executive 
director 
and 
associate 
vice 
president 
for 
Health 
and 
Wellness, 
addressed 
student 
concerns about the University’s 
recent policy change to UHS 
coverage for sexually transmitted 
infection testing at Tuesday’s 
Central 
Student 
Government 
meeting. 

Ernst explained the reasoning 
behind removing STI testing 
from the Health and Wellness fee 
was to allocate funding toward 
other priorities within UHS, like 
mental health resources. 
“There’s 
ongoing 
concern 
about student mental health, 
and we’ve made a number of 
initiatives at Health Services 
over the last year trying to 
elevate physician resources and 
have plans to grow that,” Ernst 
said. “There’s always a concern 

about access to health service 
in a timely fashion and trying 
to reduce our wait times. It 
was really clear to make those 
investments while, at the same 
time, being respectful to the 
growing cost of attendance, many 
in leadership were expecting 
we try to tap into alternative 
revenue sources to try and fund 
those priorities.”
Ernst 
addressed 
student 
backlash to the policy change by 
assuring the Assembly student 

voices were heard. 
“I think the personal stories 
people have about their anxieties 
and experiences were sufficient 
for us to say we can make an 
amendment 
to 
what 
we’re 
doing,” Ernst said. “So, the plan 
would be to try and find some 
additional resources to address 
some of those pressing health 
and wellness issues for students, 
but we would carve out a not-bill 
for STIs and other potentially 
sensitive things.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

As the threat of climate change 
continues to dominate national 
and political discourse, Wallace 
House 
hosted 
environmental 
journalist 
McKenzie 
Funk 
to 
discuss the political and economic 
ramifications of the issue. Funk 
shared his findings from his book 
“Windfall: The Booming Business 
of Global Warming,” addressing 
how 
businesses 
often 
take 
advantage of environmental issues 

to generate a profit.
The Knight-Wallace Fellowship, 
based in Wallace House, gives 
practicing 
journalists 
the 
opportunity to take a step back from 
their careers and take classes at 
the University to refine their craft. 
Funk, a 2012 Knight-Wallace Fellow, 
is this year’s featured journalist for 
the 34th annual Graham Hovey 
Lecture entitled “Seeing Green: The 
Business and Inequity of Climate 
Change.” The lecture, named after 
former journalist Graham Hovey 
who directed the fellowship from 

1980 to 1986, is an annual event in 
which the fellowship welcomes 
its incoming class and highlights a 
former member whose work relates 
to issues prevalent in the national 
conversation.
Director 
of 
Wallace 
House 
Lynette Clemetson opened the 
event, 
introducing 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
and 
emphasizing the need for more 
public support for journalists. 
“We know that in (University) 
President (Mark) Schlissel we have 
someone who not only supports 

our programs, but who supports 
the vital role of journalism in our 
society,” Clemetson said. “Having 
that support publicly is evermore 
important today at a time when 
the press has often been maligned, 
often been called ‘enemies of the 
people,’ and to know that we have a 
space here at the University where 
we uphold the role of journalism 
and we support the careers of 
journalists means so much to me 
personally and to everyone who 
passes through this program.”

Soul Smoothie & Bowls, a 
student-run smoothie and açaí 
bowl company, opened in the 
Seigle Cafe in the Ross School 
of Business last Tuesday. 
The company was created 
last year by DJ Bailey, a 2019 
graduate of the Business School, 
after he assessed the potential 
profitability and demand of the 
cafe using market research and 
surveys. Bailey said he got the 
idea when he and a group of 
Business School seniors found 
the market for smoothies and 
bowls in Ann Arbor lacked 
healthy options that offered 
fresh ingredients or convenient 
locations. 
According to Business junior 
Sabeen Khan, Soul’s director of 
marketing, the process behind 
the opening on Tuesday was 
extensive. Once the menu was 
set, the team had to figure out 
their 
suppliers, 
packaging, 
design, go-to-market strategy 
and operation analytics, which 
included answering questions 
like how many employees they 
needed or how many smoothies 
they could sell in an hour, 
as well as the technological 
aspects of the app.

In 
light 
of 
the 
2020 
budget’s impending due date, 
Oct. 1, the Washtenaw County 
Board 
of 
Commissioners 
rejected 
a 
proposal 
for 
increased funding for the 
Community Mental Health 
program 
in 
Washtenaw 
County. The potential budget 
cut came last Wednesday, 
when the commission began 
reevaluating 
funding 
for 
several county programs.
The 
program 
has 
continually received support 
from the county and provides 
mental health resources to 
adults 
and 
children 
with 
emotional disturbances and

This

explained.
Washtenaw 
County 
Commissioner 
Katie

that 
this

The Dingells have been 
a household name in Ann 
Arbor politics for more than 
85 years since John Dingell 
Sr. began representing the 
15th Congressional District in 
1933, now known Michigan’s 
12th Congressional District.
Second-year 
medical 
student Solomon Rajput has 
decided to challenge this local 
political dynasty.
Rajput 
announced 
his 
campaign 
against 
Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., on 
Thursday. He is running on a 
progressive platform with the 
slogan, “We’re done waiting.”
“I care about a couple key 
progressive issues that a lot 
of other key progressives care 
about as well, like getting 
money out of politics, fighting 
climate change through an 
aggressive 
mobilization 
of 
our economy through the 
Green New Deal, making 

college 
tuition 
free 
and 
eliminating student debt and 
Medicare for All as well,” 
Rajput said. “And for many 
issues, 
unfortunately, 
our 
current representation with 
Congresswoman Dingell is 
not. She is not a champion for 
these issues.”
Students 
have 
varying 
levels of support for their 
current representative. Public 
Policy senior Noah Rothstein, 
who previously worked on 
Rajput’s campaign, said while 
Dingell represents some of 
his political views, he wishes 
she would take more radical 
action against climate change.
“In some areas, I think 
she 
does 
well,” 
Rothstein 
said. “On local issues, such 
as PFAS, she has delivered. 
But, on the whole, I think 
Congresswoman Dingell has a 
lot of room to improve. Climate 
change, which is personally 
my most prioritized issue, has 
been one that she has not given 
enough serious attention to.”

County Board votes 
not to increase monetary
funding for programs


In the midst of an ongoing 
discussion over immigration policy, 
the Washtenaw County Board of 
Commissioners unanimously voted 
in favor of supporting a Michigan 
House of Representatives bill 
extending immigrants’ civil rights 
protection Wednesday.
As one of the largest counties 
in the state of Michigan, state 
Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, 
emphasized how significant it is 
that the county advocates in favor 
of the legislation in order to garner 
more support statewide. 
“Washtenaw is part of the 
broader discussion,” Rabhi said. 
“We’re one of the larger counties 
in the state of Michigan and having 
our voice at the table as (the) state 
government has this discussion is 
extremely important.”
State Rep. Abdullah Hammoud, 

D-Dearborn, has partnered with 
numerous organizations across the 
state including Michigan United, 
American Civil Liberties Union 
and Emgage to introduce the 
House bill, which would prevent 
local governments from using their 
own resources to enforce federal 
immigration laws. 
According to Hammoud, the 
bill would not only make Michigan 
a more “welcoming state,” but it 
would also prevent distrust from 
brewing in the community and its 
local police force. 
“First and foremost, a local 
community 
police 
force 
does 
not receive any resources from 
the government to do the job of 
federal 
immigration 
officers,” 
Hammoud said. “So, we should 
not stretch an already stretched 
police force to take on new roles. 
Secondly, when police officers in 
the community start taking on 
the roles of immigration officials, 

they break the trust and bond they 
have within communities — largely 
within communities of color and 
immigration communities.”
Like Hammoud, LSA senior 
Leena Ghannam said they believe 
this legislation could be a step in 
the right direction to mending 
Washtenaw 
County’s 
already 
strained relationship with local 
law enforcement. Ghannam cited 
the death of Aura Rosser, an Ann 
Arbor resident who was fatally 
shot in 2014 by Ann Arbor Police 
Officer David Reid, as a catalyst for 
residents’ distrust with the local 
police force.
“I 
think 
that 
the 
people 
in 
Washtenaw 
County 
have 
distrusted the police immensely,” 
Ghannam said. “(Rosser’s) death 
represented 
a 
fundamental 
problem with police, not only 
because of their abundant racial 
and gender profiling, but also their 
willingness to breach privacy and 
act violently. The greater 
Ann Arbor area will develop 
a better relationship with 
the police if the police show 
that they are actually here 
to protect the community.”
In addition to the House 
bill, 
other 
prospective 
legislation include a bar on 
stop-and-search 
policies 
without 
reasonable 
suspicion, a bill that prevents 
immigration hold requests 
in county jails, a proposal to 
provide legal assistance to 
immigrants for deportation 
hearings 
and 
multiple 
proposals that would restrict 
state schools and universities 
from refusing admission due 
to immigration status. 
For Ghannam, allowing 
immigrants 
the 
equal 
opportunity to study at 
Michigan 
universities 
is essential, due to the 
state’s 
incredibly 
diverse 
population. 
With 
this 
education, she believes the 
state could help immigrants 
navigate the lengthy process 
of becoming a U.S. citizen.
“The 
University 
of 

Michigan is an institution that 
should give universal access to 
deserving 
students,” 
Ghannam 
said. 
“Immigration 
policy 
constantly shifts to what the nation 
and federal administration fears 
most at any given moment. I believe 
that undocumented students are 
innocent — they are not criminals. 
A safe pathway to citizenship can 
more easily occur if undocumented 
immigrants are allowed equal 
opportunity to study and work in 
the United States.”
According to the Office of 
Financial 
Aid, 
the 
University 
“welcomes the application and 
enrollment 
of 
undocumented 
students” and offers a pathway for 
undocumented students to receive 
in-state 
tuition. 
Additionally, 
advocacy groups like Student 
Community 
of 
Progressive 
Empowerment work to promote 
resources 
for 
undocumented 
students and build a sense of 
community on campus.
Despite local support, House 
and Senate Republicans have rolled 
out counter bills such as the “Local 
Government Law Enforcement 
Protection Act and the County Law 
Enforcement Protection Act” that 
would ignore local laws preventing 
peace officers or local officials from 
working with federal authorities 
regarding 
an 
individual’s 
immigration status.
One of the sponsors of the 
bill, state Rep. Beau LaFave, 
R-Iron Mountain, believes state 
officers have a duty to honor the 
federal 
government’s 
requests 
if an individual is wanted by the 
government.
“The problem in our republic is 
if one state says they’re a sanctuary 
state and says ‘You want to come 
here, so we’re going to give you a 
driver’s license and be included in 
all of the benefits of this state, then 
the immigration laws of California 
are superseding that of Iowa, 
and that is not appropriate in a 
republic,” LaFave said.

Trade Center collapses after attack

September 12, 2001
Students were left stunned, 
saddened and frantic to reach friends 
and family yesterday morning after 
a pair of hijacked airliners slammed 
into and demolished both towers 
of New York City’s World Trade 
Center. The attack is the worst 
terrorist episode ever carried out in 
the United States. 
Television stations carried live 
footage of the buildings’ collapse, 
including pictures of a hijacked 
Boeing 757 slamming into the 
south tower. The attack began at 
about 8:45 a.m., and by 10:30 a.m. 
both buildings were absent from 
the city’s skyline. In Washington, 
about 100 people died when a plane 
crashed into the Pentagon. 

“Our society changes as of today. 
This is a watershed event,” said Law 
Prof. Robert Precht, the attorney 
for one of the four men convicted of 
bombing the World Trade Center in 
1993.
 “I’m overwhelmed. I kind of 
wish I was back in the city – I can’t 
reach my friends, the lines are 
down. I used to work down there, 
on the 82nd floor of the World 
Trade Center… I don’t know if any of 
my co-workers actually survived,” 
said Phillip Ng, an LSA sophomore 
from New York. 
Classes for the day were canceled 
around 
noon. 
About 
15,000 
students attended a vigil in the Diag 
last night, shortly after President 
George Bush made his first address 

from the Oval Office.
“I’m a former student from 
(New York University) and I’m still 
waiting to hear from people,” said 
LSA sophomore Anna Szymanski at 
the vigil. “One NYU dorm is a block 
away from the trade center - I’m 
praying every-one is safe.”
At the Michigan Union shortly 
after the bombing, LSA freshman 
Aubair Simonson purchased a 
poster of the New York City skyline.
“I’m going to hang it. I’m never 
going to forget this day,” he said. “All 
we have left now of the World Trade 
Center, which is almost the center-
piece of the New York skyline which 
I love, is just pictures.”
In Ann Arbor, city and federal 
buildings also closed around noon. 

So many people responded to a call 
to donate blood, hospitals were 
forced to turn them away.
The events began to unfold 
early yesterday morning, when 
knife-wielding hijackers sent the 
two planes into the twin 110-story 
towers. The deadly calamity was 
witnessed on televisions across the 
world as another plane slammed 
into the Pentagon, and a fourth 
crashed outside Pittsburgh.
Said Adm. Robert J. Natter, 
commander of the U.S. Atlantic 
Fleet: “We have been attacked like 
we haven’t since Pearl Harbor.”
Establishing the U.S. death toll 
could take weeks. The four airliners 
alone had 266 people aboard and 
there were no known survivors. 

At the Pentagon, about 100 people 
were believed dead.
In addition, a firefighters union 
official said he feared an estimated 
200 firefighters had died in rescue 
efforts at the trade center - where 
50,000 people worked - and dozens 
of police officers were believed 
missing.
“The number of casualties will 
be more than most of us can bear,” 
a visibly distraught Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani said.
No one took responsibility for 
the attacks that rocked the seats 
of finance and government. But 
federal authorities identified Osama 
bin Laden, who has been given 
asylum by Afghanistan’s Taliban 
rulers, as the prime suspect.

Aided 
by 
an 
intercept 
of 
communications 
between 
his 
supporters and harrowing cell 
phone calls from at least one flight 
attendant and two passengers 
aboard the jetliners before they 
crashed, 
U.S. 
officials 
began 
assembling a case linking bin Laden 
to the devastation.
“I think Bush and the people 
around him really don’t understand 
what is going on in world politics,” 
said University political science 
Prof. Emeritus J. David Singer. 
“This might help because it’s a 
demonstration that America is so 
vulnerable to other kinds of attacks 
and weapons and that defense 
against missiles should be low 
priority.”


Ernst said UHS continues to 
work toward a long term solution 
to satisfy student needs. 
“Going forward, carving out 
the billing for STI testing is 
going to have us rethink the 
budget in the near term, and 
that’s okay — we can still do 
that with prioritization,” Ernst 
said. “The plan moving forward 
would be to work to actually 
bring the analyzers into our 
UHS lab. That’s going to take 
some time, but once we’re able 
to do that, then we’ll be able 
to reduce those costs and get 
back on track from a budget 
standpoint.”
Following the guest speaker, 
community members Mozhgan 
Savabieasfahani 
and 
Blaine 
Coleman 
spoke 
urging 
CSG 
members to pass a resolution 
against military aid to Israel. 
Savabieasfahani and Coleman 
held 
signs 
reading 
“We 
are against military aid to 
Israel,” the phrase they asked 
CSG members to turn into a 
resolution. 
Each 
community 
member spoke for three minutes 
regarding the Israel-Palestine 
conflict and advocating for the 
resolution.
Savabieasfahani 
referenced 
the 
divestment 
resolution 
passed by CSG in 2017.
“I assure you, you will make 
headlines — global headlines,” 
Savabieasfahani said. “What you 
did with divestment did make 
headlines, it went all over the 

world. There are still headlines 
coming out talking specifically 
about Michigan. You have this 
huge power in your hands.” 
CSG President Ben Gernstein 
then 
summarized 
recent 
initiatives from the executive 
branch, including taking steps 
to re-authorize the New York 
Times Readership Program, a 
project which provides students 

access to the New York Times 
through their University email 
accounts. 
Gernstein also discussed the 
introduction of a Well-being Fee 
Working Group. Originally the 
Well-being fee, which was added 
to tuition last year, provided 
for this group in addition to 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services and Maize & Blue 
Cupboard.
“This group is going to have 

the goal of improving and 
enhancing the resources for 
those two entities on campus, 
but not through a fee,” Gernstein 
said. 
Gernstein aims to complete 
the subsidization of Group-X 
gym passes to be set up by 
next Tuesday. CSG is also 
continuing to work with the 
Michigan Unions and Libraries 
to provide more microwaves on 
campus.
“The Campus Affordability 
Task Force from the previous 
year recommended that this is 
an important fixture for food 
insecurity on campus as it is a 
short term project that allows 
for students who might bring 
lunch from home because they 
cannot afford to purchase lunch 
on campus the opportunity to 
heat up that lunch in a library 
or one of the unions,” Gernstein 
said. 
Additionally, Gernstein spoke 
about 
working 
to 
revitalize 
the 
Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship, created in 2016 
with the goal of eliminating 
financial barriers for students 
to be active leaders. Because 
the money provided in that 
scholarship has decreased over 
the years, Gernstein hopes to 
increase funding for it. 
Gerstein also spoke about 
goals of expanding the Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
distribution 
requirement to every school and 
college within the University, 
as well as ensuring the current 
requirement within LSA is as 
meaningful and up-to-date as 
possible.

“It was a lot of trial and 
error,” 
Kahn 
said. 
“But 
operational challenges are 
a part of growing as a team 
and a business.” 
The current menu was 
created after months of 
testing. It includes popular 
menu items like the Soul 
Bowl, an acai based bowl 
topped with granola and 
various 
fruits, 
and 
the 
Hail Kale, a kale blend 
smoothie that’s a playful 
nod to Michigan school 
spirit. Kahn said the team 
went 
around 
to 
various 
local towns over fall and 
spring break last year to 
look up menus and scout out 
people’s preferences. 
“We went to someone’s 
apartment with a bunch of 
Nutribullets and a bunch of 
ingredients from Meijer to 
test out different variations 
and alternatives to some 
of the smoothies we liked 
back in our hometowns,” 
Kahn 
said. 
“We 
pride 
ourselves 
on 
our 
fresh, 
local, organic ingredients 
so we had to make sure that 
we were being cost efficient 
but also getting that proper 
healthy ingredients that we 
wanted.”
Soul Smoothies & Bowls’ 
marketing strategy relies 
on various social media 
platforms and has captured 
the interest of students, 
including 
LSA 
freshman 
Maddy Wolkov.
“Considering I’m not even 
in Ross and I walked all the 
way here for it, I feel like it 
will be really popular and 
draw people in, especially 
after you work out or even 
if you’re just passing by,” 
Wolkov said. 
Soul Smoothies & Bowls 
CEO Justin Schulman, a 
Business senior, explained 
the company is far more 
than just a smoothie stand 
that’s conveniently located 
— it is intertwined with the 
culture the Business School 

fosters. 
“People 
believe 
that 
there is a culture that’s 
cultivated 
within 
Ross 
and 
that 
definitely 
exists in certain areas,” 
Schulman 
said. 
“We’re 
clearly catering towards a 
very specific audience. I 
don’t think there’ll be the 
same level of attention or 
popularity if it was in any 
other school. We know the 
certain demographic that 
studies in Ross, that is in 
Ross, that’s looking for this 
type of food: quick, healthy 
and aesthetically pleasing.” 

As an organization, Soul 
Smoothie aims to parallel 
the 
values 
of 
positive 
business 
and 
action-
based learning that Ross 
fosters in their academic 
environment, Khan said. By 
creating a business founded 
on good principles and an 
outlet for students to learn 
how to run a business, Soul 
Smoothies & Bowls has 
created a space for students 
to apply some of the skills 
they learned within their 
classrooms 
toward 
real-
world business operations. 
According to Khan, this 
was one of the reasons 
why 
the 
initial 
pitch 
to 
the 
Business 
School 
administration 
was 
so 
successful. 
“(The 
Ross 
administration) was really 
receptive because it’s a 

good manifestation of the 
principles and ideas that 
they want their students 
to carry forward — it could 
really be something that 
students can run as well as 
a Michigan student start-up 
that can continue,” Khan 
said. 
At the end of the day, 
however, Khan thinks it 
was also simply a good 
business model. 
“For 
them, 
Ross 
and 
Seigle make money and 
they’re 
a 
business 
as 
well,” Khan said. “(Soul 
Smoothies & Bowls) was a 
good way for them to have 
the 
customer 
base 
that 
they’re targeting actually 
be the ones who’s doing the 
marketing and making the 
smoothies.”
As for their future plans, 
Khan said the team is 
prioritizing expanding the 
business outside of Seigle 
and diversifying the menu.
“Menu 
expansion 
for 
sure will happen,” Khan 
said. “We are constantly 
testing 
our 
current 
smoothies. 
We 
want 
to 
do seasonal offerings and 
want to expand that. Part 
of that comes with making 
sure that we have the ops 
down and being receptive 
to student feedback.”
Soul Smoothies & Bowls 
hopes to join the list of 
startups, such as the popular 
coffee 
chain 
Espresso 
Royale or the downtown 
bookstore 
Literati, 
that 
have left a permanent mark 
on Ann Arbor as well as the 
University campus. 
“At the end of the day, 
our strength comes in our 
team as well as a general 
hustle that each one of 
us 
possesses,” 
Schulman 
said. “That team-oriented 
atmosphere 
has 
allowed 
us to form a lot of close 
relationships in the Ann 
Arbor area. And that hustle 
has been the driver that has 
allowed us to persevere in 
a lot of the similar areas 
that other small businesses 
might have faced.”

Dingell, a top progressive 
in the Democratic Party, 
has been serving Ann Arbor 
since 2015. Dingell has also 
been a long-time proponent 
of Medicare for All and 
founded a Medicare for All 
caucus in July 2018.
When asked how the two 
candidates differ on this 
point, Rajput acknowledged 
that Dingell has been a 
proponent of the policy.
“Congresswoman 
Dingell is an advocate for 
Medicare for All and I am 
grateful that she has taken 
a progressive stance on that 
front,” Rajput said. “I think 
that is something that many 
progressives appreciate. But 
I think for me, part of the 
reasons why I’m running 
are for the areas we disagree 
on.”
One of Rajput’s biggest 
differences with Dingell is 
her support of the Green 
New Deal. The Green New 
Deal, introduced by Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., currently has 94 
cosponsors including two 
Michigan 
representatives 
— 
Rep. 
Rashida 
Tlaib, 
D-Mich., and Rep. Andy 
Levin, D-Mich. — but not 
Dingell. 
In a statement earlier 
this 
year, 
Dingell’s 
Communications 
Director 
Maggie 
Rousseau 
said 
Dingell has urged Congress 
to take more aggressive 
stances 
on 
combating 
climate change.
“Mrs. Dingell has been 
reviewing the Green New 
Deal, but believes it is time 
Congress 
takes 
serious 
action to address climate 
change,” Rousseau said.
When asked to comment 
on 
Rajput’s 
campaign, 
Kellie Lounds, the Dingell 
campaign’s political director 
and 
a 
recent 
University 
graduate, 
restated 
the 
congresswoman’s 
commitment to the issues in 
the district.
“Congresswoman Dingell 
is focused on continuing to 

lead the fight in Congress 
for 
quality, 
affordable, 
healthcare safeguarding the 
environment, and delivering 
for 
hardworking 
men 
and women in Southeast 
Michigan,” Lounds wrote 
to The Daily over a text 
exchange. “Across the 12th 
Congressional 
District, 
Mrs. Dingell meets with 
everyone, and this August 
held 10 Congress in Your 
Community events at local 
farmers 
markets, 
hosted 
seven town halls and has 
gone to more than 200 
meetings and events. People 
who know her, know she is a 
fighter.”
Rajput 
said 
he 
felt 
compelled to run for office 
because people are looking 
for ambitious new ideas and 
not safe solutions.
“I think they are trying to 
solve very big problems with 
very small solutions,” Rajput 
said. “That even if they were 
to get implemented, would 
not have any meaningful 
impact on anyone’s life. That 
is what I fundamentally 
disagree with. I think we 
need to dream up a solution 
that will actually solve the 
problems and not kick the 
issue down the road.”
Rajput said even though 
he’s never been an elected 
official, he does have a 
political 
background. 
He 
began grassroots political 
organizing by organizing 
for 
former 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 
presidential 
campaign. 
After 
her 
election 
loss, 
Rajput said he felt an urge 
to stay politically engaged 
and that he saw a similar 
sentiment 
on 
campus. 
That’s when he decided 
to start a local grassroots 
organization, the Michigan 
Resistance. 
“After 
the 
Hillary 
campaign, 
we 
ended 
up 
having 
many 
volunteers 
who really wanted to keep 
fighting but didn’t really 
know what to do,” Rajput 
said. “And we had heard 
that there were a lot of bad 
bills, anti-progressive bills, 
coming through the state 
legislature and we heard 
that even a few dozen calls 

could make a difference 
on the state level. So we 
organized and we did what 
we knew how to do as 
organizers and made tons of 
calls and got volunteers to 
make tons of calls. We were 
calling about six bills and 
we were able to help stop all 
of those six bills.”
Rajput acknowledged that 
taking on an established 
figure such as Dingell will 
be challenging. He cited his 
lack of name recognition as 
one roadblock.
“Nobody 
knows 
me,” 
Rajput said. “That’s the fact 
of the matter. But I need 
to get my name out there 
and I need to get people to 
know who I am and know 
what I stand for. So we’re 
just going to have to do a lot 
of talking with voters and 
building a grassroots army 
to educate voters about this 
campaign.” 
He cites Ocasio-Cortez 
as a source of inspiration, 
both ideologically and due 
to the challenges she faced 
when campaigning against 
then-incumbent Rep. Joe 
Crowley, D-N.Y.
“I 
am 
inspired 
by 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” 
Rajput said. “I think that’s 
another thing that everyone 
could probably guess. She 
inspired me because she 
believed that you don’t need 
to be a dynasty, you don’t 
need to be a millionaire or 
have corporate connections 
to win an election.”
Rothstein 
also 
has 
a 
message for future students 
who may be hesitant to vote 
for a name they aren’t as 
familiar with.
“Keep an open mind,” 
Rothstein said. “Solomon 
is addressing some of Rep. 
Dingell’s 
shortcomings. 
Being that he grew up in the 
era of skyrocketing student 
debt, mass shootings and 
worsening climate change, 
Solomon will be able to view 
these issues from a more 
personal perspective that 
aligns more closely with our 
generation.”

During his introduction of 
Funk, Schlissel said many of 
the highlights in his six years 
at the University have been 
at Wallace House events. 
He expressed appreciation 
for the program and the 
opportunities it offers.
“My secret jealousy is I 
don’t qualify to be a Knight-
Wallace fellow, but think 
about how cool it would be to 
be able to sit in at any class 
you want at the University 
and not have to take any 
testing or grades and not have 
to take any prerequisites,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“It 
really 
sounds like college heaven.”
After 
introducing 
this 
year’s 
Knight-Wallace 
fellows, Clemetson turned 
the podium over to Funk. 
According 
to 
Clemetson, 
journalists 
often 
report 
on 
the 
topic 
of 
climate 
change with a scientific or 
political lens and analyze 
the tension between the two, 
but Funk’s work is unique. 
He 
approaches 
climate 
change with a business lens, 
investigating 
how 
hedge 
funds 
and 
organizations 
twist 
the 
issue 
to 
their 

benefit.
Funk 
explained 
how 
he became involved with 
environmental 
journalism. 
He was working on narrative 
stories for magazines in 2006 
when he received an email 
from 
the 
Environmental 
News Network about the 
Canadian military heading 
north to claim the melting 
territory. 
He 
described 
joining their expedition and 
learning what motivated it.
“The reason that Canada 
was up there was one, the 
Northwest 
Passage 
was 
melting, and two, there was 
a ton of oil there, maybe 
a quarter of the world’s 
undeveloped oil,” Funk said. 
“And so the moment the 
ice started pulling back in 
the Arctic, you can see this 
opportunity and you can see 
people begin to scramble for 
it.”
Funk 
then 
shared 
his 
discoveries from years of 
investigative 
work. 
According 
to 
Funk, 
businesses 
use 
their 
influence 
with 
the 
wealthy 
people 
to 
profit 
from the effects of climate 
change. He gave numerous 
examples, 
including 
how 
insurers fortified valuable 
homes on the East Coast and 
in California from natural 

disasters 
while 
ignoring 
those of poorer residents. 
He focused in particular on 
border walls and companies 
that 
take 
in 
revenue 
building structures between 
countries.
Funk pointed to a $10-12 
billion plan made by Dutch 
architects to protect New 
York City from storms like 
Hurricane Sandy as a useful 
framework for understanding 
his area of focus. 
“The clear favorite was a 
seawall that would go across 
the 
Verrazano-Narrows 
(a strait separating Staten 
Island and Brooklyn) and it 
would block any storm surge 
coming toward Manhattan,” 
Funk said. “It would also send 
even more water to the poor 
areas on the side. So what we 
had was a seawall that would 
protect the wealthiest part of 
the wealthiest city perhaps 
in the world while drenching 
the poor.”
Clemetson opened up the 
event to questions from the 
audience. Funk responded 
to an audience member who 
asked about positive efforts 
to combat the climate crisis.
“I 
don’t 
think 
we’re 
doomed,” Funk said. “I think 
it’s a question of how many of 
us are saved.”

“One of the main problems 
that we’re seeing here is that, 
really, the state is not funding 
mental health in the way that 
it needs to be funded,” Scott 
said. “So, we know that we’re 
providing great services for 
people in this county, but 
the state is not fully funding 
mental health programs across 
the entire state.”
The 
state 
of 
Michigan 
has yet to approve a budget, 
which means county officials 
remain unclear about what 
cuts need to be made. Scott 
says one of the reasons for 
the 
county’s 
rejection 
of 
Community Mental Health’s 
proposal was that it failed 
to include recommendations 
made by the county that 
would allow for a potentially 
smaller budget.
“There’s a big budget crisis 
looming at the state level too,” 
Scott said. “The state doesn’t 
have a budget, hence we don’t 
have a budget, so we’re going on 
a lot of numbers and assuming 
different things. Community 
Mental Health assumed a 4 
percent rate of growth in the 
amount that they’re getting for 
the budget.”
LSA junior Elizabeth Einig, 
a member of both the Active 
Minds 
club 
and 
Mentality 
Magazine at the University of 
Michigan, said budget cuts in 
any form to an organization 

like Community Mental Health 
may have drastic effects on the 
treatment and support patients 
are able to get from the county.
“There’s 
already 
a 
tremendous amount of social 
stigma and financial barriers 
for mental health, and I feel 
like that proposal is definitely 
going to make things worse, as 
far as the situation of not being 
able to access treatment,” Einig 
said. 
Budget 
concerns 
often 
lead to cuts to mental health 
resources, 
but 
the 
county 
would be unlikely to take away 
funding from an organization 
providing support to those with 
physical illnesses, Einig said. 
“Mental 
illnesses 
are 
definitely more invisible, and 
so it’s harder for people to 
emphasize and want to allow 
more funding for it,” Einig said. 
“I think physical illnesses are 
much more understood. We’re 
more comfortable with it.”
Cuts 
to 
the 
Community 
Mental Health budget could 
potentially affect students in 
Washtenaw County as well. 
LSA senior Sarah Avery works 
with U-M students who seek 
out resources for mental health 
at Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center and 
as a Residential Advisor in 
a 
freshman 
dorm. 
Avery 
explained it can be difficult for 
students to find help.
“One of the main reasons 
students don’t ask for help is 
because they either don’t know 
where to go for help, or they 

can’t afford it,” Avery said. 
“Having 
affordable 
options 
that are clear and out there for 
people to use in Washtenaw 
County 
will 
make 
people, 
hopefully, more drawn to use 
those programs to get the help 
they need.”
Despite 
concerns 
over 
potentially 
reduced 
mental 
health funding, Scott said the 
county has been looking only 
at 
administrative 
cuts 
and 
potential ways to consolidate 
services, so as to manage the 
money 
Community 
Mental 
Health takes out of the county 
general fund without affecting 
the people the organization 
serves.
“It’s hard work, and I want 
them 
to 
be 
compensated 
fairly — to have retirement 
and medical benefits and paid 
time off — all the things that 
we know are so important 
for everybody working, but 
especially working when you’re 
doing hard physical and mental 
work every day,” she said.
Scott, who also works as an 
intensive care unit nurse at 
Michigan Medicine, said she 
understands 
the 
challenges 
Community 
Mental 
Health 
faces 
in 
maintaining 
its 
services.
“In 
my 
day 
job, 
I’m 
a 
nurse,” she said. “I know how 
important it is to make sure 
people are taken care of, and 
I just want to make sure we 
have these services continue 
to be provided for Washtenaw 
County.”

“We’re clearly 
catering towards 
a very specific 
audience. I don’t think 
there’ll be the same 
level of attention or 
popularity if it was in 
any other school.”

“Going forward, 
carving out the 
billing for STI testing 
is going to have us 
rethink the budget 
in the near term. The 
plan moving forward 
would be to work to 
actually bring the 
analyzers into our 
UHS lab.”

T

hough it seems like it is 
in the news quite often, 
particularly because of 
the #MeToo movement, sexual 
harassment is an everyday 
concern. 
It 
is 
especially 
a concern for workers in 
restaurants, cafés and retail, 
where most employees are 
young adults. While this can 
be beneficial, it can also create 
a toxic environment for women 
and students 
– an environment 
that 
unfortunately 
includes 
sexual harassment.
Since the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, sexual harassment in the 
workplace is considered illegal. 
Companies have since created 
policies to prevent harassment, 
but this does not completely 
stop it. Rather, no-tolerance 
sexual 
harassment 
policies 
exist to encourage individuals 
to report. However, companies’ 
investigations 
can 
be 
as 
damaging as the harassment. 
Reporting and investigation 
processes 
need 
reform 
to 
eliminate victim-blaming and 
retaliation. Victims should not 
be on trial.
I 
experienced 
a 
poor 
investigation first-hand. At a 
café job in the summer of 2018, 
a worker 10 years my senior 
took advantage of the freezer’s 
tight space, and he groped and 
rubbed my body against my 
will. I avoided him the rest of 
my shift and tried to ignore 
what 
happened. 
But 
once 
home, I obsessively recalled 
every detail. It was not the 
first time someone hurt me, so 
I convinced myself I deserved 
what he did. I mapped what I 
did wrong and what I should 
have done to escape his grip 
sooner. 
To 
escape 
further 
harm, I quit before my next 
shift and returned to my 
previous movie theater job. I 
was severely depressed and 
terrified to report. After all, I 
had been there for two weeks 
and my assailant had been 
there for a decade. However, 
the general manager at the 
café was suspicious and told 
a worker whoever harmed me 
would be fired. So, a week after 
quitting, I emailed a report 
to the manager. I assumed 
corporate 
would 
become 
involved, they would interview 
my assailant and the decision 
would be made without any 
drama. I assumed incorrectly. 
They 
investigated 
the 
abused instead of the abuser. 
Corporate talked about my 
mental well-being to workers 
uninvolved. They threatened 
write-ups if the situation was 
discussed, 
yet 
called 
staff 
repeatedly for questions. In 
the 
end, 
the 
environment 
became hostile and fearful, 
as my assailant was declared 
innocent. I resented myself for 
reporting.

Yet, I am not the only one 
who has felt this way or who 
has 
experienced 
retaliation 
after 
reporting. 
Sexual 
harassment is an epidemic 
in the United States, and it is 
not only a problem when the 
news deems it one. Fifty-four 
percent of women surveyed in 
a 2017 ABC News-Washington 
Post poll reported they had 
been sexually harassed, and 
30 percent said they had been 
sexually harassed by a man in 
the workplace. Moreover, 23 
percent said it was a superior 
who harassed them. Power 
dynamics already take control 
away 
from 
subordinates. 
Whether it be boss to employee 
or professor to student, the 
superior can abuse their power 
and 
attack 
young 
women 
and students without fearing 
consequences. 
Superiors 
keep their position without 
worry, while victims’ lives are 
dissected.

Workers are then not only 
in danger of being sexually 
harassed but are in danger of 
physical and mental outcomes 
of harassment and retaliation. 
According 
to 
NBC 
News, 
sexual 
harassment 
victims 
can experience physical side 
effects including headaches, 
muscle pain and “chronic” 
high blood pressure and blood 
sugar 
issues. 
Furthermore, 
mental health issues such as 
depression, anxiety and post-
traumatic 
stress 
disorder 
are prevalent among sexual 
harassment survivors. For me, 
I sank deeper into my self-
harm. For some, it can result 
in suicide. Obviously, reform is 
needed, but change can happen 
only through proactive efforts. 
Thoughts and prayers will not 
solve the sexual harassment 
crisis.
Companies must improve 
training 
and 
investigations. 
According to a study reported 
by 
the 
Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commission, 
75 
percent 
of 
those 
who 
report 
harassment 
in 
the 
workplace 
face 
retaliation. 
The retaliation can vary from 
gossip, undeserving discipline, 
reassignment, demotions and 
being fired. A University of 
Massachusetts Amherst study 
found two-thirds of victims 
who press charges are fired. 

Despite the fact that firing an 
employee for pressing charges 
is illegal in the United States, 
it is overwhelmingly common. 
Hence, only companies can 
change their behavior when 
they do not abide by the law. 
The BE HEARD Act is a great 
legal start, but if companies 
do 
not 
already 
follow 
laws, we cannot anticipate 
strong results. The sexual 
harassment 
reporting 
and 
investigative processes need 
to be analyzed and reformed 
to aid the victims, not further 
attack them further. Workers 
should not be at risk when on 
the job. For student workers, 
they already are at risk on 
campus for sexual harassment 
and retaliation. They deserve 
to be safe at their jobs. 
Workspaces should be positive 
environments 
spurring 
productivity, not trauma. 
Women 
and 
students 
can take action by starting 
the 
conversation, 
perhaps 
meeting with supervisors to 
discuss 
sexual 
harassment 
policies 
and 
prevention 
training. 
Students 
can 
be 
ambassadors 
to 
provide 
a 
testimonial 
perspective 
and be their own advocate. 
However, the extra effort is 
not solely the responsibility 
of women and students. It is 
not up to the oppressed to 
overthrow the oppressor when 
companies are a resourceful 
bystander. It is impossible 
to change workplace sexual 
harassment without company 
involvement. 
While 
many 
have 
training 
explaining 
the no-tolerance policy, it 
obviously does not do enough. 
When I worked at the café (a 
major chain), the only sexual 
harassment training was the 
scheduling 
manager 
saying 
it was a no-tolerance policy. 
In a place where most of the 
staff are teenagers and young 
adults, 
this 
is 
dangerous. 
Women and students are in 
peril when companies do not 
value employees. The training 
must focus on how sexual 
harassment harms people, not 
how it harms the company. 
People 
are 
more 
invested 
in learning when it directly 
involves 
them. 
In-depth 
workshops 
should 
discuss 
how sexual harassment affects 
the work environment, how 
it affects life outside the 
workplace and how it affects 
mental health. Each side effect 
impacts the other and can 
take years to heal from, if the 
survivor heals at all. Sexual 
harassment 
goes 
beyond 
causing a bad day – sexual 
harassment sabotages daily life 
and can even end one.

Young, working and sexually harassed

A

t the end of July in 
downtown Detroit, the 
crowded Democratic field 
of presidential candidates took 
the stage at the Fox Theatre in the 
midst of what could be another 
severely divisive election cycle in 
America. 
Discussing some of the most 
pressing matters across our nation 
in an effort to ultimately take 
the White House from President 
Donald Trump in 2020, the 
candidates blasted each other, as 
well as the current and former 
presidents on a wide range of 
controversial 
issues, 
especially 
stressing 
immigration, 
climate 
change, healthcare, gun violence 
and criminal justice. 
But the truth is that virtually 
all 
American 
politicians 
are 
disregarding an issue that could 
be the most serious threat to this 
nation’s survival: our staggering 
national debt. 
Conservative or liberal, we 
should all be alarmed by this 
deepening 
crisis. 
Currently 
standing at over $22 trillion and 
growing with no end in sight, our 
debt is continuously forcing our 
country further into a hole that 
could one day be inescapable. 
Unfortunately, 
politicians 
for 
decades 
have 
determined 
that 
combating 
this 
financial 
catastrophe is not worth the 
political price of being voted out of 
office, deciding instead that their 
careers take precedence over our 
country’s future. 
The blame should not be placed 
on any one party. While our 
federal government did achieve 
a surplus during the Clinton 
administration when there was 
more support for measures aimed 
at cutting back the debt, we have 
since then experienced immense 
irresponsibility, 
making 
our 
nation more vulnerable with each 
passing year.
Under President George W. 
Bush, the national debt rose $5.8 
trillion, 
more 
than 
doubling. 
The problem continued under 
President Barack Obama, with the 
figure growing by a shocking $8.6 
trillion during his two terms as he 
was forced to deal with the worst 

economic crisis since the Great 
Depression, leading him to increase 
government spending to stop the 
economy from sinking further into 
recession. And, should President 
Trump remain in the Oval Office 
until 2025, he is expected to 
contribute a disturbing $9.1 trillion.
The truth is that while these 
developments are dangerous for 
everybody, the future is looking 
the worst for young people who 
will have to bear the brunt of this 
economic crisis if politicians fail to 
act now. 
Without proper and effective 
bipartisan action on this issue, we 
are set on a course to economic and 
social unrest that will spell disaster, 
especially for millennials and 
Generation Z. As the debt continues 
on its alarming climb, the large 
figure will ultimately drive interest 
rates to high, unhealthy levels as 
other nations — which already 
own much of America’s debt — will 
require more persuasion to invest 
in our fiscally irresponsible nation. 
In response to rising rates — 
which will dramatically discourage 
business investment, slow our 
economy and lead to lower wages 
— the federal government will be 
forced to subsidize the heavy cost 
of the interest by cutting spending, 
especially through a reduction 
in social programs such as Social 
Security and Medicare. With a 
decrease in social aid programs, 
our country could be plagued 
by turmoil and riots as everyday 
citizens become unable to put food 
on the table for their families. Still, 
even after making these significant 
cuts, the government will also likely 
need to sharply raise taxes, which 
again will steer our country toward 
a severe economic downturn. 
That is not all. In a scenario 
that 
becomes 
more 
probable 
as this harsh reality worsens, 
our government, in the face 
of 
uncontrollable 
debt, 
could 
even fail to pay back some of its 
debt, precipitating a worldwide 
depression 
and 
calling 
into 
question the survival of this nation 
itself.
Putting this aside, we have much 
to worry about. In the midst of such 
dangerous fiscal conditions, it is 

only a matter of time before our 
government may become unable 
to borrow effectively in order to 
solve situations currently posing a 
threat to our nation, including war, 
public health crises and natural 
disasters. As the Committee for 
a Responsible Federal Budget 
states, 
“Governments 
often 
borrow to address unexpected 
events... This is relatively easy 
to do when the federal debt is 
small. However, with a large and 
growing federal debt, government 
has fewer options available.” The 
speed and efficiency with which 
our government is routinely able 
to respond to society’s needs, 
which is taken for granted 
now, will undoubtedly become 
challenging to maintain under 
these circumstances. 
Even our national security 
is threatened by our debt crisis. 
In February of this year, a bill 
was introduced in Congress to 
officially consider the debt a 
danger to our national security. 
“If we do not change our course, 
we will be responsible for one 
of the (worst) catastrophes this 
nation has ever experienced: the 
crash of the American economy 
and the demise of a superpower,” 
Congressman 
Andy 
Biggs, 
R-Ariz., a bill co-sponsor, said in 
a statement. Truthfully, we are 
in trouble. Our politicians have 
kicked the can down the road 
for years, passing this crisis on to 
the next generation. They have 
greatly feared the political price 
of attempting to address this issue, 
but we can no longer ignore this 
glaring problem. We must all, 
regardless of political affiliation, 
begin to make difficult choices 
that will require strength and 
compromise, resulting in a better 
future for generations to come. 
Whether we raise taxes, cut 
spending, or both, we must 
remember what is at stake, set 
aside our differences and act with 
a purpose. We owe it to ourselves, 
our children and our nation. 
We have an obligation to act 
immediately.

The serious crisis nobody is talking about

Yin and Yang: Restoring the order of politics

EVAN STERN | COLUMN

A

t the first Democratic 
debate, 
he 
proposed 
giving $1,000 to every 
American over 18. This is an idea 
that few presidential candidates 
have advocated for as openly as 
Andrew Yang.
At the second Democratic 
debate, he presented himself as 
the antithesis of President Donald 
Trump. “... an Asian man who 
likes math,” Yang said, drawing 
cheers from the crowd.
Throughout the 2020 race, 
Andrew Yang has consistently 
distinguished himself from long-
established politicians currently 
dominating the field. With a kind 
of honesty hard to find in politics 
these days, he seems to genuinely 
care about putting the people first. 
As Yang explained in the second 
debate, politicians are getting 
caught up with what he called 
“political theater” and losing 
sight of what is important. At 
these debates, policy is neglected 
as those on stage are fighting to 
come up with the best comebacks 
for a few memorable seconds. It’s 
tiring to see candidates attacking 
each other when they should 
be trying to convince us to vote 
for them. Yang, however, stays 
focused on what he believes in — 
helping the people — and never 
wavers in reminding us through 
every response he gives. Amid the 
chaos of Joe Biden takedowns, 
Yang always manages to bring 
back the discussion to the central 
issue and educate people about it. 
 
While all of these candidates 
are running as the solution to 
replacing Trump, their success 
is contingent on what they have 
to offer and on what makes 
them stand out. At the end of 
this campaign cycle, the final 
nominee will have won their 
spot because they were able to 
convince the American people 
they can deliver what is best for 
the country. As voters, we should 
look for a candidate who cares 
about fixing our problems, and 
Yang is slowly convincing me he 
is the one. Throughout this race, 
Yang is slowly bringing change 
to the way we see politics and 
setting a standard for the kind 

of political leader we need. From 
the start, he has been different 
from the others with his complete 
transparency in describing issues 
and how he plans to solve them. 
Despite being a political outsider, 
he manages to command respect, 
politely sharing what he has to 
offer without stepping on the 
other candidates. With Yang, it is 
refreshing to see someone up on 
the stage who is rising above party 
politics to bring a “Humanity 
First” campaign. His goal here is 
to fight for the people and solve 
problems that affect Americans, 
not to bring a political party back 
to power. This is the direction 
that politics should be moving 
in, away from partisanship and 
toward securing the future of the 
people that politicians represent.
In 
addition 
to 
affecting 
political change, Yang is also a 
fighter. If his campaign journey 
shows us anything, it’s that he 
has potential to be an underdog. 
As a former entrepreneur with 
no political experience, he had 
less than three minutes to speak 
in the first debate. The lack of 
airtime is unfortunate; with the 
amount of proposals listed on his 
website, Yang could give fellow 
candidate Elizabeth Warren a 
run for her money for having a 
plan for everything. His proposed 
policies cover everything from 
family needs to federal reforms, 
and he even provides a section 
of miscellaneous ideas tailored 
to improving everyday lives. No 
other candidate has as many 
ideas as thorough and detailed 
as Yang’s. America needs a leader 
who is able to deliver what they 
are promising and is transparent 
with the people in how those 
plans will be achieved. Clearly, 
Yang’s leadership qualities have 
spoken to the people; he has been 
performing far better than anyone 
expected from a political novice 
and became the ninth candidate 
to qualify for the next debate.
Despite his lack of political 
experience, Yang has proven 
himself to be an educated and 
eloquent speaker. He can tie 
everything from health care 
to climate change back to his 

central point: lifting up the 
American 
people. 
While 
I 
think providing $1,000 to those 
over 18 would never work on 
a national scale, he has slowly 
led me to the realization that 
our economic problems are 
the root causes of all of our 
other issues. It really does 
seem simple from Yang’s point 
of view: If we work to improve 
American lives economically, 
we are a step closer to equality 
on so many levels. We can stop 
scapegoating immigrants for the 
loss of jobs, healthcare can be 
affordable, and we can actually 
address 
racial 
inequality 
beginning with the wealth gap. 
Yang is a forward-thinker and 
anticipates new issues, showing 
us, while he is aware of our 
present problems, he is already 
looking to fix upcoming ones 
like the implications of artificial 
intelligence.
I know it is unlikely Yang 
will 
secure 
the 
Democratic 
nomination. America is still 
far from being ready for such a 
straightforward leader like Yang, 
much less an Asian-American 
president. But even if he falls flat 
in the primaries, he has shown 
himself to be the type of leader 
we need. Throughout this race, 
he has brought a new perspective 
to 
politics, 
challenging 
our 
current system with his honesty. 
At the very least, his foresight 
has made us more aware of the 
imminent problems and pointed 
us in the direction of finding a 
candidate who is focused on the 
bigger picture for the future. 
If we can learn anything from 
Yang’s platform, it is that we 
need to progress forward, and we 
need a leader who can lead that 
movement. 
American 
politics 
needs to move in the right 
direction, away from the last few 
years of hatred and divisiveness 
and towards acceptance and 
unity. As part of a generation 
finally able to vote, we should 
take Yang’s message to heart: 
“Not left, not right, but forward.”

Wednesday, September 11, 2019 — 5A

More than 25 years after the 
release of their debut album Enter the 
Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers, the Staten 
Island hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan 
still occupies a prominent place in 
the genre’s (and popular culture’s) 
collective memory. 
Backed by RZA’s 
diverse, 
lo-fi
 
production, 
the 
original members 
of 
the 
Wu-Tang 
Clan helped create 
the 
dark, 
gritty 
sound that would 
influence 
many 
East Coast records 
in 
the 
coming 
years.
The Hulu miniseries “Wu-Tang: 
An American Saga,” produced by RZA 
himself and Alex Tse (whose writing 
credits 
include 
“Watchmen” 
and 
“Superfly”), explores the lives of the 
rappers around the time of the group’s 
inception, in and around backdrops 
such as Staten Island’s Stapleton 
Projects, stylized in the group’s music 
as the chaotic, dangerous Shaolin. 
The narrative centers around RZA 
(Ashton 
Sanders, 
“Moonlight”), 
introduced by his real name Bobby 

Diggs. Disillusioned by the crime and 
violence surrounding him, his friends 
and family, he attempts to withdraw 
into his passion for music, bolstered by 
an eclectic taste in everything from old 
soul records to kung-fu films.
Even for those familiar with the 
Wu-Tang Clan and its rather extensive 
mythology, the series can be difficult 
to track. While some characters 
such as Russel Jones (T.J. Atoms, 

“Orange is the New Black”), eventually 
the 
infamous 
Ol’ 
Dirty 
Bastard, 
are 
instantly 
recognizable, 
other 
members of the Clan are much less so, 
complicated by the fact that there is also 
a wide set of supporting characters. 
RZA is the most sympathetic of the 
bunch, torn between the necessity to 
support his family by participating in 
the low-level street hustle like many of 
his friends are and the desire to escape 
it all through music.
The other founding members of 

the clan are no less precociously 
talented in their own abilities, but are 
portrayed as much more cynical about 
the prospects of using hip-hop as an 
out from the reality of their lives. RZA 
is in many ways the main protagonist 
of the story simply because of his 
stubborn ambition and vision — since 
uniting the Wu-Tang Clan involved 
reaching across several types of 
dividing lines, mostly drawn up by the 
loosely organized 
crime rings the 
members 
were 
involved in.
“Wu-Tang: 
An 
American 
Saga” 
is 
much 
less 
“Bohemian 
Rhapsody” 
and 
much more “The 
Wire,” with the 
first few episodes 
chugging 
along 
at a rather slow pace. This pacing does 
make it easier to eventually decipher 
the webs of alliances between the 
characters, but perhaps is not the 
simplistic biopic many fans were 
probably 
expecting. 
Ultimately, 
“Wu-Tang: An American Saga” is 
less about the music of the Wu-Tang 
Clan and more of a step back from the 
legend, letting the world know just how 
difficult and impressive the group’s 
meteoric rise was in every aspect, from 
financial to logistical to personal.

‘Wu-Tang’ is an American saga

TV REVIEW

“With 
the 
whole 
world 
crumbling, we pick this time to 
fall in love.” 
So 
says 
Ingrid 
Bergman 
(“Gaslight”) 
as 
Ilsa 
in 
“Casablanca,” 
Michael 
Curtiz’s 
1942 masterpiece of American 
cinema. Thanks to Ann Arbor’s 
Michigan Theater, I’ve had the 
good fortune of seeing the film at 
the theater’s Historic Auditorium 
twice during my time as a student 
here. It’s hard not to think about 
history when you step inside the 
venue, built in 1928. The decor 
makes you feel as though you’ve 
left the 21st century and entered 
the days of Old Hollywood, when 
everything 
cinema 
would 
one 
day become was ahead. For all I 
know, Ann Arborites in the 1940s 
probably saw “Casablanca” for the 
first time in the same exact place 
I did. 
The 
world 
has 
undoubtedly 
gone through some major changes 
since 1942. Although we may not 
be in the middle of a major world 
war like our protagonists Rick 
(Humphrey Bogart, “The Maltese 
Falcon”) and Ilsa, humans in 
2019 carry the weight of our 
own unique set of challenges — 

climate 
destruction, 
economic 
inequality, 
overpopulation, 
the 
list goes on. Our attitudes about 
social justice have also changed 
tremendously, admittedly making 
certain aspects of “Casablanca” 
difficult to stomach, particularly 
its 
treatment 
of 
women 
and 
Sam 
(Dooley 
Wilson, 
“Stormy 
Weather”), 
a 
black 
musician 
at 
Rick’s 
nightclub. 
In 
many 
respects, “Casablanca” is very 
much of its time, for better or for 
worse. 
Yet, there’s something about the 
movie that separates it from the 
conventions of its era, accounting 
for 
its 
popularity 
worldwide, 
across all age groups. Its central 
story, that of Rick and Ilsa’s 
complicated, whirlwind romance, 
feels timeless and widely relevant, 
despite the World War II-specific 
politics and culture it’s steeped 
in. As Sam sings time and time 
again throughout the film, “It’s 
still the same old story, a fight 
for love and glory.” “Casablanca” 
tells a universal tale, one of 
love and death and war and the 
things we sacrifice for what we 
know to be important. It poses 
genuinely 
thought-provoking 
questions 
about 
responsibility 
and patriotism that are as old as 
time itself. What do we owe to 
the greater good? What must we 
sacrifice for what’s right? Did 
Rick make the right decision in 
forcing Ilsa to get on that plane, 
even though it may have cost him 
his last chance at a great love? Or 
was this decision simply the best 
way he knew to express his love 
for her?
As 
I 
asked 
myself 
these 
questions 
while 
watching 
the 
movie, I found myself wondering 
about the people I was watching 
it with. How many had seen 
“Casablanca” before? Why did 
they decide to come tonight? 
What were their relationships to 

the movie? Was anyone here even 
alive during World War II?
That final question is the one 
that sticks with me the most. 
Before we know it, there will 
be no one left to remember what 
life was truly like then. Yet, it’s 
still a comfort to know that, in a 
world that’s constantly changing 
and where people are constantly 
dying, there are some things that 
will never die, like “Casablanca” 
itself, and the memory of the 
way Ingrid Bergman looks at 
Humphrey Bogart in that final 
scene. “Casablanca” has stood and 
will continue to stand the test of 
time, to serve as a testament to 
what we valued, how we loved 
and the things we were willing to 
do for each other. In that sense, 
“Casablanca” is immortal. 

As time goes by, ‘Casablanca’
remains a classic for the ages

FILM NOTEBOOK

ELISE GODFRYD
Daily Arts Writer

When I find a song to share with my mom, 
I always wait until it’s the two of us in the car. 
It would be difficult to trace how many of our 
shared obsessions began with this exact scene, 
but I imagine the fugitivity of the moment and 
ourselves on the road — minds and bodies alike 
— are somehow linked.
It’s something to do with not having to 
watch her face if I don’t want to, which is 
something to do with fear of finding disinterest 
in it, which is something to do with how 
absurdly high stakes these transactions feel 
to me. It doesn’t make me feel like I’m in the 
crosshairs; instead, it calls my understanding 
of the person sitting beside me into question.
A folk cover of a Nirvana song played 
between those seats, as did my mom’s first 
contemporary hip-hop record, as did the song 
that initiated our (neverending) Solange phase. 
Once, on a night drive during my new wave 
spurt, I queued a sequence that started with 
The Replacements’ “I Will Dare,” probably 
included a Cars song I thought she might be 
able to pretend wasn’t the Cars (Dad loves, 
Mom hates), definitely included Echo & the 
Bunnymen and concluded with Iggy Pop. She 
told me she hadn’t listened to those songs since 
she was around my age, commuting to college 
at U-M Dearborn. 
Those 
moments, 
identifying, 
then 
translating across a synapse I hadn’t detected, 
are the ones I wait for. The ones that 
compensate for the face she made when, say, I 
tried to convince her Bob Dylan could sing.
***
I don’t know if I should be writing about 
this. I wasn’t there to see how it began: with the 
artful labor of creating a mixtape. I’ve never 
had a cassette slipped into my hands, never 
consulted someone’s carefully printed, cryptic 
title to gather a hint as to what I might hear. 
I’ve come of age in the days of Spotify and 
other digital streaming services. I don’t tend 
to look at the past in a way that lends itself to 
longing, so I quickly adapted to an increasingly 
intangible experience with music. Even after 
admiring box after box of vinyl, I rarely make 
purchases at the record stores I visit, and I 
don’t miss the choreography of extracting a 
CD without leaving fingerprints on it. Does 
that mean that I have no taste of that old-school 
magic?
I don’t think so. I think when I pull up the 
Spotify playlist I commissioned from a friend 
after hearing his favorite Kendrick Lamar 
song by chance and finally admitting that I 
had neglected a revolutionary genre for too 
long, I know something of its charms. I don’t 
think that because the songs on the digital 
counterpart of a mixtape were easier to compile 
that less attention and care were devoted to the 
act of compiling them. I don’t think that kind of 
transaction will ever depreciate if music is still 
part of it.
***
I’ve begun to confuse the absence of a 
person with the absence of their music. I’ve 
begun to confuse the presence of a person 
with the sound of their music. I’ll give you an 
example: It’s not when I visit the house where 
my Pa once lived that I perceive his absence 
most clearly. That might proceed in part from 
my Nana’s refusal to move anywhere else and 
curator-like preservation of the home they 
once shared. Regardless, it’s when I listen to a 
song and think, I know exactly who would love 
this song, and that person is him, and the music 
sharing comes to a sad, jolting halt that I know 
what it means for him to be gone.
It got worse when my Grandma Laura died. 
Unlike my Pa’s heart attack, her death was 
anticipated, slowly, painfully ambled toward. 
At one point, she gathered her grandchildren 
around her chair and presented us with paper 
butterflies, glued to adjustable clips so that we 
could attach it to something. It was supposed 
to be her way of being with us, even as her 
mobility slipped away. I cried in the bathroom: 
 
Because of what it meant, I both wanted and 
didn’t want it in the most severe way.
Six years after her death, in the process 
of moving in and out of college dorms, I lost 
the butterfly. One of the most fragile, most 
important belongings I have ever had, and ever 
will have. Telling my mom was much more 
shameful, much more distressing than any 
Catholic sacrament I had ever been forced to 
participate in. How could my grandmother 
ever be present if I lost the object in which she 
vested that presence?
I don’t know, but I can tell you that I turned 
to music.
“Paper Butterfly,” I titled it. The caption 
adds, “favorite songs of and songs inspired 
by the favorite songs of my grandma, Laura 
Leigh Schmidt (1948-2012).” It’s a playlist on 
Spotify, with a foundation of Paul Simon and 
Queen (her favorites), a few songs of special 
significance interspersed (Elton John’s “Your 
Song”: the song my mom told me my uncle 
and Grandma Laura danced to at his wedding) 
and, of course, songs I wish I could play for her. 
Yusuf’s “If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out.” 
Paul Simon’s not the only one with the voice 
of an angel. Grace Potter & The Nocturnals’s 
“Stars.” I can’t look at the stars / They make me 
wonder where you are. Aretha Franklin’s “You 
Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman.” Tell me 

what that feels like.
That’s more than translating across a 
synapse. It’s the letter I’ll never send because 
I can’t. It’s a language for grief, a less painful 
iteration of the imagined conversation, 
where at least the silence, still impervious, is 
disturbed.
***
So I’m confessing once and for all: I’m your 
Spotify stalker.
I can’t tell you how many essays and sorrows 
and long nights your playlists and inadvertent 
recommendations have gotten me through, so 
what I should say next is thank you.
Thank you for luring me into the worlds of 
dream pop and contemporary R&B, worlds 
I’m not sure I could have found the entrance to 
without you.
Thank you for dismantling the concept of 
“guilty pleasure,” for listening publicly, so I can 
also listen publicly to songs I worshipped in 
ninth grade, when I need them to remind me 
of what that time felt like.
And no, I’m not proud of this one, but 
thank you for showing me you’re alive when 
sometimes I wonder. When I haven’t heard 
from you in a few days, sometimes I stakeout 
the “Friend Activity” sidebar. Then I’ll see your 
name and your song and the speaker with the 
arcs representing sound, and I exhale. You’re 
okay. It’s post-punk, so you’re probably not 
happy. But the music is on, so you are alright. In 
adequate hands, for now.
***
I’ve used playlists as the language of my 
grief, so, naturally, I’ve also used them to try 
to make legible fleeting, off-mark feelings that 
could have thickened into something like love. 
“Could have” because I should preface this 
with another confession, that I forgot how the 
story goes. It was the same promising, blinding 
boy-meets-girl, followed by the same violation 
of boundaries, the levying of power dynamics, 
for which boy expresses guilt and girl comforts 
boy. (Who comforts girl?)
But between points A and B of course, 
there was music. There were songs that said, 
I’m trying to figure out my feelings for you. 
There were careful recommendations that 
said, You might understand this, even though 
no one else has. The songs added up in our 
minds and told us what we wanted to believe 
about one another. For me, that was that I 
found a man who wasn’t just luring me in with 
feigned respect for boundaries and limits, 
who wouldn’t take advantage. (I was wrong.) 
For him, it seemed something more like I was 
the antidote to some part of himself, with 
involuntary powers of healing. (He was wrong, 
too.)
These 
song 
statements 
and 
misrepresentations were housed in Spotify’s 
collaborative playlist function. We had two 
of them; especially in the beginning, I would 
contemplate my contribution obsessively. I 
tried to calculate all the ways it could misfire, 
both in terms of whether he would actually 
like it and whether it would say what I wanted 
it to say. And I would wait for his response 
song, check the playlists obsessively, listen the 
moment he added something. 
One day, close to the end, at a time where I 
was somewhere between wanting to see him 
often and feeling like I was supposed to want 
to see him often, I was walking to work. It 
was cold and I’d forgotten the earmuffs he’d 
once complimented. To make matters worse, 
my hair was pulled back, so the wind gnawed 
mercilessly at both ears. I inserted an earbud in 
each, numbness still blossoming, and queued 
the most recent songs he added to one of the 
playlists. 
One was about finding a reason to live in 
another person, which he had promised I 
wasn’t, that he wouldn’t let one person be 
that, but the song still had warmth. Another 
was about a couple’s atypical, wonderfully 
awkward track to falling in love. I felt a flood 
of warmth, starting with my ears. His songs 
playing in them, their lyrics I figured might as 
well be his words, warmed me from the inside 
out, swirled around my head, dizzying, almost 
fashioning a pair of earmuffs out of thin air and 
a few well-sung notes.
After the boundary violation, I grew 
resentful of his music. I didn’t look forward to 
adding songs to our playlists anymore; when 
I did, it was perfunctory and begrudging. 
I shuddered when I saw him listening to a 
song I’d recommended or whenever his name 
displayed on my “Friend Activity” (“friend,” 
the word I questioned). When I realized how 
not only permissible but also how simple 
it would be to escape this dimension of his 
lingering, it was ridiculously liberating. How 
unburdening it was to unfollow the playlists, 
to delete the one I made for him and lastly to 
unfollow him.

It’s unnerving how still, when I listen to a 
song by an artist he liked and I once liked, it 
carries a new weight of having been part of a 
trust I developed with someone but deeply 
regret. Maybe it’s that we surrender pieces 
of ourselves to our songs, the transaction, the 
dialogue that they are. We must because the 
associations between a person and their music 
is wonderful sometimes, unbearable other 
times and always incontrovertible.

A love letter from your
grateful Spotify stalker

“God damn, man-child,” pens Lana Del Rey in her love 
letter to America — fitting, perhaps, within the contemporary 
culture of “fuckbois,” casual hookups and sneakerheads. Del 
Rey’s latest album, however, is no feminist rage against the 
patriarchy. No, Norman Fucking Rockwell! is all at once a 
condemnation and celebration of American culture; an ode 
to the complex, bittersweet history of the “American Dream.” 
Disregarding layers of thematic symbolism and metaphor, 
the album itself is a walk down memory lane. Del Rey’s 
style has always held an a vintage flair, from her slow, 
traipsing vocals to the timeless quality of her songs. Del Rey 
often appears to be old beyond her years, as if a ghost from 
centuries past inhabits her body, rather than a young woman 
of the 21st century. 
Throughout the album, Del Rey recalls artists and 
genres from throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. The 
opening of her first track, “Norman fucking Rockwell,” 
is reminiscent of classic Hollywood soundtracks with its 
flowing orchestration. “Fuck It, I Love You” echoes the big-
band era, borrowing from Doris Day’s “Dream a Little Dream 
of Me.” Del Rey’s “Doin’ Time,” a cover of the Sublime’s 1996 
song by the same name, recalls both the music from the end 
of the 1990s and the artistry of George Gerswhin, whose 
piece “Summertime” is sampled in the song. “The Next Best 
American Record” references Led Zeppelin’s “Houses of the 
Holy,” further reinforced by the track “The Greatest,” where 
Del Rey croons “Me and my friends, we miss rock n’ roll.” By 
the end of the album, Del Rey has given us a grand tour on the 

history of American music 
and culture.
But 
where 
the 
album 
shines isn’t simply in its 
extensive 
name-dropping 
of 
other 
prolific 
artists. 
No, Lana Del Rey can stand 
confidently 
on 
her 
own 
two musical feet, no piggy-
backing necessary. Rather, 
this 
walk 
down 
memory 
lane 
provides 
momentum 
for 
an 
overarching, 
far 
more important theme: the 
simultaneous 
oppression 
and empowerment of the 
American Dream. 
Del Rey sets the scene 
by evoking the legacy of 
Norman 
Rockwell, 
both 
in the title of the album, 
the titular song and by 
referencing 
his 
name 
throughout 
the 
fourteen 
tracks. Rockwell, a popular 
artist throughout the 20th century, made his career through 
illustrations which depicted domestic scenes of American 
everyday life. Through his art, Rockwell captured the very 
essence of the American Dream. However, these works, 
unsurprisingly, focused on the greener side of the grass, 
romanticizing much of the true American experience. 
In reality, the American Dream excluded many from its 
idealistic embrace. The dark underbelly absent from much of 
Rockwell’s artist works was — and still is — characterized by 
rampant racism, poverty, drug use, inequality and more. In 
fact, it was Rockwell’s idealism of American daily life which 
earned him varying degrees of condemnation from critics, 
despite his popularity and success. Thus, Rockwell’s legacy 
recalls not only what is evident in his artwork, but more so 
what is absent from his work. 
Wielding Rockwell’s legacy as her own painter’s brush, Del 
Rey explores both the American Dream, and its ever-present 
shadow of nightmare. This comparison is consistent throughout 
her every song; Del Rey sings of dysfunctional, often toxic, 
relationships, echoing the duality of the American dream and 
the American people’s love-hate relationship with its mythic 
ideal. This is further emphasized through the album’s striking 
lyrics. In “Venice Bitch” Del Rey sings, “You’re beautiful 
and I’m insane / We’re American-made,” referencing how 
the American 
Dream 
has 
been a sort of 
ever-present 
torment: 
always just out 
of reach, but 
close 
enough 

to taste. 
The American Dream, while a grand standard to strive 
for, has always been poisoned by its diminishing tangibility. 
“Fuck It, I Love You” reaffirms this. “Maybe the way that 
I’m living is killing me” — whether it be back-breaking work 
for a livelihood afforded to only the lucky few, or the self-
destructive rebellion that followed post-’50s disallusionment, 
the American Dream often has inspired more harm than good. 
Yet at the same time, Del Rey’s emotional, provoking 
exploration of the American Dream in itself confirms that 
she, like everyone, cannot help but be hypnotized by this 
distant shore. Even in her criticism, Del Rey simultaneously 
celebrates America in all its glory and shame. Just as love and 
hate are said to walk the same thin line, so too does desire 
and rejection of the American dream exist on two sides of the 
same coin. 
As a conclusion hovers over the final lines of this review, 
one thing becomes starkly apparent: Despite all these words 
strung together in an attempt to express the pure, radiating 
power of Lana Del Rey, there is so much more to say. With 
every replay of the album, more and more is unpacked within 
Del Rey’s masterful singing and imaginative lyrics. Complete 
comprehension of Norman Fucking Rockwell! may very well be 
just as unattainable as that beautiful, cruel American dream. 
But the thing about Lana Del Rey is that understanding is 
irrelevant to enjoy the hypnotic, spine-tingling power of her 
music. 
So, go take a well-deserved listen to Del Rey’s new release. 
Call it a mandatory exercise of patriotism, if this review 
isn’t motivating enough. In true American spirit, bring your 
speakers, find a lawn chair somewhere sunny and grab an 
ice-cold Coke, because “baby, remember, I’m not drinking 
wine / But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine.”

Norman Fucking Rockwell!

Lana Del Rey

Polydor & Interscope Records

Returning to Ann Arbor this past 
week for my senior year has caused me to 
reflect upon my first fall in Ann Arbor. 
Coming from a small town in Florida, I 
knew I was about to be inserted into a 
very different environment, but I had no 
idea how different it was going to be. 
My town had a relatively small local 
music scene; cover bands played at bars 
every Friday and Saturday night but 
that was about all that I knew of. I was 
ready to get involved in a college music 
scene, but because I didn’t know a soul 
in the state of Michigan, I really didn’t 
know what to do in order to get involved. 
Then, someone that I met through some 
huge Facebook page, who would later go 
on to become one of my closest friends 
freshman year, invited me to go to a 
show for a local emo/pop-punk band, 
Seaholm. They sent me an address, and 
said that music was going to start around 
8:00 p.m. or so.
I showed up at around five after 
eight, terrified that I was going to be 
late and miss the concert, and was 
immediately terrified. There were so 
many faces I didn’t know, all dressed in 
shirts for bands I had never heard of. I 
was nervously anticipating someone to 
prompt me with the classic, “Who do 
you know here,” but luckily, I finally 
found my friend and we made our way 
to the basement where Christmas lights 
hung across the ceiling like a line of 
frozen fireflies. 

We stood right in the front for the 
entire night, listening to loud chaotic 
guitars 
accompanying 
the 
moaning 
vocals that flooded the room. But 
somehow, it still felt inimiate. It felt 
unapologetically Midwestern to me. 
There’s a subgenre of emo music called 
“Midwestern emo” that’s known for open 
tuned, twinkly guitars and lyrics about 
growing up and melancholy. People 
often think this music sounds juvenile, 
but I don’t think that’s a negative thing. 
Standing in that basement listening to 
people I never knew sing about feelings, 
I felt myself coming into this strange, 
foreign place.
As the crowd started to disperse after 
the final set of the night, my friend 
and I approached the current singer/
guitarist for Seaholm, and tried not to 
fangirl as we complimented them on 
their set. I had been to very few concerts 
outside of the realm of jazz, classical 
and the occasional big name rock band, 
so being able to just walk up to band 
members seemed like an insane concept. 
However, Jake and the rest of the band 
members were incredibly nice and told 
us to come to more shows, giving us 
some information on the scene and just 
making polite conversation with two 
wide-eyed freshman. 
As I walked out of the venue, I saw 
people sitting on the porch talking, joking 
and hanging out as the night started 
to emit the magical sort of presence it 
has in the fall. This was the first “DIY” 
event I had ever been to, and I can pretty 
confidently say that if I hadn’t gone to 
that event, I probably would have had a 
very different collegiate experience. As I 

plunged into the local music scene more 
and more, I realized how creative Ann 
Arbor really is, and how many distinct 
and diverse ways there are to express 
yourself.
So, if you’re a freshman and you’re 
reading this: Go to a show. Even if you 
don’t know anyone. Even if you have a 
9:00 am the next day. Even if you don’t 
like the bands playing. Even if you 
don’t like music. Shows like these don’t 
happen anywhere else in the world, and 
they really are a special experience that 
I hope everyone can enjoy.

With injuries in the past, Black 
hopes to key offensive progression

As soon as Tarik Black heard 
the 
question, 
a 
contagious 
smile took over his face.
He had just been asked about 
his week one touchdown — his 
first since a nearly-identical 
one in his Michigan debut two 
years earlier. That was back 
when Black was the future of 
the Wolverines’ wide receiver 
corps, the promising freshman 
who tallied 149 yards in his 
first three games.
Then, just as soon as his 
career had taken off, he broke 
his foot, sidelining him for the 
season. Less than a year later, it 
happened again — same thing, 
different foot.
“I knew exactly what it was,” 
Black said of his second injury. 
“… I simply just ran a route and 
I guess the way I broke, the 
way I planted, my foot didn’t 
like it.”
By 
now, 
Black’s 
injury-
related struggles have been 
well-documented. He returned 
to play three games late last 
season, but was never 100 
percent. He finished the year 
with just four receptions for 35 
yards.
In 
the 
meantime, 
conversations with his mom 
helped him get through it all. 
When a reporter asked him 
Tuesday whether he considered 
quitting football, an automatic 
“absolutely not” shut down the 
question.
Because now — for the first 
time in two years — Black is 
ready to move on.
“I’ve never been hurt playing 
football in my life,” Black said. 
“So it was kind of something 
new for me and I kind of got 
a little PTSD from it coming 
back. But now I think I’m out 
of that phase, just past that and 
ready to move forward.”
With 
the 
injury 
behind 

him, Michigan’s new offensive 
era 
was 
beginning, 
even 
with Donovan Peoples-Jones 
temporarily sidelined.
Everything, 
it 
seemed, 
was falling into place. Then 
the Wolverines nearly lost to 
Army as that offensive promise 
floundered in a game that went 
to overtime tied at 14.
“Our guys have made some 
plays and I wish we had some 
big plays that we’ve missed 
cause they’ve been big plays,” 
said 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh Gattis. “But we’ve just 
got to continue to work on 
... the timing, the speed of 
routes, releases. When we have 
guys wide open, we’ve got to 
cash in on those. So our kids 
understand it and we’ve gotta 
make those plays.”
And Black, despite his seven 
receptions and 104 yards in 
two games, knows it. Through 
two games, Michigan has just 
nine self-described “explosive” 
plays — passes of 16-plus yards 
or rushes of 12-plus. The 
Wolverines 
have 
repeatedly 
been within inches of breaking 
games open with big plays. 
Instead, balls have bounced off 
receivers’ hands or just beyond 
their reach and the big-play 
potential of their receiving 
corps has only fleetingly come 
to fruition.

“I think we can go way up 
from here,” Black said. “If you 
watch the film, there’s a lot of 
plays that we can make going 
forward. And I think you guys 
will see — trust me, you’ll see 
— that this offense is going to 
be crazy.”
Black stands at the center 
of the Wolverines’ offensive 
dichotomy. When Michigan’s 
offense was at its best in its 
27-point 
first 
half 
against 
MTSU, he was its standout 
performer, notching 80 yards 
before halftime. Late in the 
second quarter, he missed a 
drive with cramps — a product 
of not having a full workload in 
two years. Since then, he has 
just 24 yards on three catches.
Conditioning is one of the 
key areas that Black says the 
Wolverines’ current bye week 
will 
help 
with. 
Continued 
familiarity in Gattis’ offense 
is another, as is Peoples-Jones 
potential return to health.
And 
maybe 
Michigan’s 
offensive promises won’t have 
to be promises anymore.
“I want our play to do the 
talking for us,” Black said. 
“And I think moving forward, 
you guys will see that we are a 
really good group of receivers 
and we’re going to work our 
tails off to do whatever we can 
to have our team win.”

How one yell changed the game

Michigan’s defense had its back 
against the wall. 
It was one thing to fall a 
touchdown behind to an unranked 
foe in the first half. Three lost 
fumbles tend to produce such 
tenuous positions, and Army 
had done its best to capitalize. 
But a two-touchdown deficit in 
the second half against a ball-
controlling savant — in the midst 
of offensive woes — would’ve been 
another mountain to scale entirely. 
Perhaps even a death knell.
The Black Knights completed 
a 29-yard pass to vault into the 
Wolverines’ territory, then slowly 
marched inside the 10 with under 
nine minutes to play in the third 
quarter. That’s when Don Brown’s 
defense toughened up and made its 
game-changing sequence happen.
“Now, it’s 1st and goal at the 4. 
We gave up two explosive plays 
— one run, one pass,” Brown 
said Monday, gesticulating and 
enunciating 
in 
a 
professorial 
manner. “We gave up the explosive 
pass, now they’re 1st and goal at 
the 4. They run speed option to the 
right. Jordan Anthony goes in, he 
grabs one leg. Ben Mason’s trying 
to get in, he grabs another. And 
then Glasgow comes over the top 
and shoulders him, and then Uche 
pulls him back to keep him out of 
the end zone.”
In the moment, the touchdown-
saving play seemed to only delay 
the inevitable. Army had the ball at 
the one-yard line. Giving a triple-
option side three plays to get one 
yard is akin to baking a cake with 
all the ingredients already poured. 
Placing it in the oven is nothing 
more than a formality.
“What do you think our shot is 
to stop 2nd and 1?” Brown asked, 
rhetorically. “Pretty hard, right?
By the skin of its teeth, 
Michigan’s defense lived to play 
another down. That’s when it all 
turned. 
What first appeared to be 
merely a boneheaded mistake 
by Army — the fullback moving 

prematurely for a false start, 
sending the offense back five yards 
— turned out to be a shrewd tactic 
by the Wolverines.
It was all part of a plan the 
defense 
had 
been 
practicing 
beforehand.
“So, we come out and we’re 
going to move the defense. We’re 
going to show them the three-
man front and we’re going to go 
ahead and step in the front two 
to try to stop this fullback. So our 
call is “MOVE!” ’ Brown yelps, 
his violent cadence re-enacting 
that of his team. “So when we 
made the move call, the fullback 
went *stutter steps* and that 
moved them back five yards.”
Senior 
cornerback 
Lavert 
Hill flashed a sly smile when 
that stunt comes up in media 
availability three days later. 
“We had practiced it a couple 
times and we decided to just call 
it in the game,” he said.
Is he surprised it actually 
worked?
“Yeah,” he chuckled, “a little 
bit.”
The 
off-schedule 
play 
subsequently forced Army into a 
play it almost never makes. The 
Black Knights finished 129th (of 
130 teams) in both interceptions 
and turnovers in 2018. But there 

it was — senior VIPER Khaleke 
Hudson in the quarterback’s 
face, ball fluttering well short of 
an intended target, then falling 
helplessly into the arms of an 
awaiting Lavert Hill. 
Perhaps unexpectedly, they’d 
chosen to throw the ball, and 
the defense was prepared. Hill 
made amends for his dropped 
interception 
a 
week 
prior, 
securing the pick, returning it to 
the 22-yard line and breathing 
life into a team that had been 
slowly succumbing to a relentless 
Army offense.
The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 
marched right down the field, 
traversing 78 yards in 12 plays to 
tie the game up on a touchdown 
from freshman running back 
Zach Charbonnet. It was a 
14-point swing in no more than 
a half-dozen minutes of game 
time.
It’s hardly hyperbolic to say 
the play salvaged a game that 
was rapidly extending beyond 
the team’s grasp. It may have 
saved a season from crashing 
before it could even take flight.
“That’s probably the key of 
the game,” Brown said, “because 
if we don’t make that stop there, 
who knows? You can’t predict 
it.”

Michigan bounces back from loss 
to Stanford, dispatches California

With less than a minute 
remaining, the No. 7 Michigan 
women’s field hockey team 
(2-2) was in a pinch.
Defending 
a 
one-score 
lead, the Wolverines defense 
watched a California player 
bring the ball just outside the 
Wolverines’ goal in a last-ditch 
effort to score. But after an 
errant pass led to a scramble 
for the ball, Michigan senior 
Guadalupe Fernandez Lacort 
managed to scoop up the ball 
and take it out from the goal, 
capping off the team’s road 
weekend with a win. 
“I was proud of our team, 
at 
how 
hard 
they 
fought, 
especially in the second half,” 
said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. “… I think (junior 
back) 
Halle 
O’Neill’s 
been 
playing amazing defense; she’s 
really been our field general 
and just the foundation of the 
backfield, and really proud of 
her play. She’s been playing 

really inspired field hockey.” 
But the Wolverines faced a 
heartbreaker of their own on 
Friday in Palo Alto against No. 
21 Stanford. Michigan started 
with a two-score lead following 
a goal by sophomore forward 
Tina D’Angolell early in the 
second half. That advantage 
soon collapsed, though, when 
Stanford’s 
Corinne 
Zanolli 
scored 
twice 
in 
just 
five 
minutes to tie the game. 
The score remained tied 
through two overtime periods, 
eventually going to a shootout 
competition. The Wolverines 
looked to have the game in the 
bag after the Cardinal failed to 
score on their first three out of 
five attempts, while Michigan 
had scored on its first two. 
But the Wolverines fell apart 
thereafter, failing on their next 
three attempts while Stanford 
rallied to tie the shootout. 
In the next round, Michigan 
again was denied, and Zanolli 
scored to win the upset for the 
Cardinal.
“It was a long, hard-fought 

game,” Pankratz said. “I think 
our team’s really resilient, so 
they’re positive and supportive 
of each other and just moving 
forward to learn and grow and 
get better.” 
Sunday’s win over the Bears 
brought a gratifying end to a 
weekend that was bitter at first 
for the Wolverines. Michigan 
was able to protect its lead, 
O’Neill was a standout on 
defense and freshman Sarah 
Pyrtek secured the win late 
in the game by scoring off a 
rebound for her first collegiate 
goal. 
Pankratz indicated that going 
forward the team would look to 
improve one-on-one defense 
and find combinations with 
good chemistry on the field, 
as well as focus on recovery 
following a demanding road 
trip — one that tested the 
resolve of her team.
“We’re still growing, it’s a 
process,” Pankratz said. “We’re 
getting better every day. I think 
we can always get better at 
everything, like any team.” 

‘M’ glides to 3-0 victory over Cornell

With 11 minutes remaining in 
the first half, Michigan senior 
forward Jack Hallahan sped 
down the right side of the field, 
lofting a pass over the head of 
a bystanding Cornell defender 
into the box to graduate student 
forward Nebojas Popovic.
Popovic instantly redirected 
the ball towards junior forward 
Mohammed Zakyi, who fired a 
point-blank shot past the arms 
of diving Big Red goalkeeper 
Brady McSwain to give the 
Wolverines (2-1-0) the lead, 1-0.
Michigan never looked back 
on Friday night, scoring two 
additional goals to shut out 
Cornell (0-1-0) 3-0, in a match 
highlighted by a suffocating 
Wolverines defensive unit and 
opportunistic forward play. 
Prior to Zakyi’s goal, each 
team held the other to brief 
possessions 
in 
the 
middle 
of the field and struggled to 
advanceinto their opponent’s 
territory.
But 
Michigan’s 
defense, 
anchored by veteran junior 
defender Jackson Ragen, soon 
clamped down on Cornell’s 
forwards and disbanded their 
efforts, 
giving 
its 
offense 
the 
necessary 
possessions 
to 
produce 
goal-scoring 
opportunities.
“The defense 
kept 
shutting 
them out and 
getting us the 
ball. And that 
just put more 
pressure 
on 
their 
defense,” 
Popovic 
said. 
“Because 
of 
that, 
we 
got 
more space in 
the middle of the park.”
As the pendulum swung in 
their favor, the Wolverines 
were able to spread out the Big 
Red’s defense, allowing their 
forwards to open up the field 
with long passes and run their 
offense 
through 
Hallahan’s 
swift ball-handling on the right 
side.
“(Hallahan) 
opens 
teams 

up with his dribbling and his 
eye,” Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley said. “(The forwards) 
are 
all 
benefitting 
because 
of the attention put on Jack. 
We are fortunate to have him 
facilitating for the others.”
Three 
minutes 
into 
the 
second 
half, 
the Wolverines 
capitalized on a 
free kick from 
junior midfielder 
Marc 
Ybarra. 
Ybarra rocketed 
the 
ball 
deep 
into 
Cornell’s 
box 
towards 
Ragen, who then 
launched a tight-
angled shot from 
the back post behind McSwain 
to extend their lead, 2-0.
As the game progressed, 
Michigan 
only 
intensified 
its 
stifling 
defensive 
play, 
limiting the Big Red to only 
three shots in the second half. 
Senior 
goalkeeper 
Andrew 
Verdi tallied all four of his 
saves during the half in his first 
shutout since returning to the 

starting position.
“(Verdi’s) done great. After 
not playing for a little while, 
it’s definitely hard to adjust,” 
Ragen said. “I will bet that he 
will be even more comfortable 
now.”
Just like their defense, the 
Wolverines’ offense refused to 
let up on the gas pedal at any 
point throughout the rest of 
the game. With two minutes 
remaining 
in 
the 
contest, 
Popovic tapped a goal past 
McSwain to ice the game for 
Michigan.
Despite a slow start in which 
neither team could seem to hold 
onto possession, the Wolverines 
eventually clicked into the right 
gears to generate a dominating 
performance on both sides of 
the ball.
“We talk a lot about getting 
momentum. If we win the first 
ball, let’s get the second ball. 
And then connect the first 
pass,” said Daley. “If we can do 
those things, we think we have 
enough in the locker to unlock 
teams or keep going until they 
make a mistake.”

University of Michigan Law School, 1225 Jeffries Hall

4:10–5:30 p.m. 

Sponsored by U-M Office of the Provost

A CONVERSATION WITH 
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE 
JUSTIN AMASH

The cavernous arena in 
Minneapolis was nearly empty. Few 
were there to witness Michigan, a 
team that began the season with so 
many expectations, limp off the ice 
one last time. 
It was early March, just the first 
round of the Big Ten Tournament, 
and the season was over. When it 
ended, it felt sudden, though the 
writing had been on the wall long 
before.
A year after coming within six 
seconds of playing for a national 
title, the Wolverines were going 
home prematurely.
Six months to the day later, 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson strode 
into the media room at Yost Ice 
Arena on Monday, fresh from the 
team’s first practice and ready to get 
going on a new season.
“Fire away,” Pearson said. “I’ve 
got all sorts of (answers).”
Within moments, Pearson was 
asked about how he’s approaching 
this season given what happened 
last year. A record of 13-16-7 — 
the same number of wins as Red 
Berenson’s final year, when it 
became clear it was time for a 
change — is not what Pearson was 
hired to produce. He knows that. 
Everyone in the program knows 
that.
But Pearson has been in hockey 
for his entire life. He’s been 
coaching hockey since 1982 — 
before some members of his staff 
were even born.
“I think one of the worst things 
you can do is to overreact one way 
or the other,” Pearson said. “When 
you look at the year, I think we were 
disappointed in the end result, but 
when you realize (if) you win one 
more game you finish second place 
in the Big Ten, you’re not that far 
off of a really good league. You don’t 
overreact.”
Over the course of the 
conversation, it became clear 
that the coaching staff would 

be all but the same this fall if 
former Michigan assistant Brian 
Wiseman hadn’t taken a job with 
the Edmonton Oilers. Part of 
not overreacting is not making 
sweeping changes based off of one 
year, and that was the group that 
took the Wolverines to the Frozen 
Four in 2018.
But the staff isn’t the same. 
Wiseman did leave for the NHL, 
and Pearson suddenly had an 
opportunity to reevaluate some 
things. He didn’t go looking for 
things to change after last year, but 
all of a sudden, he was forced to.
“It just gave myself and our staff 
a chance to reevaluate our program 
and what we needed to help make 
us better,” Pearson said. “That’s 
what you’re trying to do. You’re 
trying to make the program better.”
Pearson knows this program 
better than just about anyone not 
named Red Berenson. He spent 
23 years at Berenson’s side as 
an assistant, building Michigan 
into the program that made an 
unprecedented 22 straight NCAA 
tournaments.
But since 2013, when the streak 
was broken and Pearson was 
two years into his tenure as head 
coach at Michigan Tech, things 
have been different in Ann Arbor. 
The Wolverines have fallen into 
a pattern of a couple of bad years, 
followed by a good year, and then 
another down year after that. 
Michigan hasn’t made the NCAA 
Tournament in back-to-back years 
since the streak ended.
A down year in 2017 was 
followed by a Frozen Four run in 
2018. If the pattern holds, a down 
year in the 2018-19 season could 
well be followed by another strong 
season.
And now, Pearson has new 
perspectives inside the program. 
Mayotte was brought in to run the 
penalty kill and is the first full-time 
goaltenders’ coach at Michigan in 
Pearson’s memory.
“As much as you hate to see a 
guy like Brian leave — he was great 

for our staff, great in the transition, 
you really hate to see him go,” 
Pearson said. “But it’s a great 
opportunity for him and it gave us 
an opportunity to do some things 
we maybe couldn’t if he was here.”
While Pearson isn’t overreacting 
to last year, he took the chance 
presented by Wiseman’s departure 
to mix some things up. With 
Mayotte’s hiring, associate head 
coach Bill Muckalt moves from 
running the penalty kill to running 
the power play. Volunteer assistant 
Steve Shields, previously the 
Wolverines’ only goaltender coach, 
is now part of coaching team with 
Mayotte.
Fresh voices and fresh 
perspectives can always be useful 
to a coach. Overreacting to last 
season would be a mistake, but 
not changing anything would be 
equally incorrect. Pearson was 
forced into making changes with 
Wiseman’s departure, and it may 
well be the best thing that could’ve 
happened to Michigan this season.
In the last weekend of the 
regular season this year, the 
Wolverines return to that 
cavernous arena in Minneapolis. 
Maybe there will be a few more 
fans, and maybe, if Pearson’s 
changes work, the team slowly 
skating off the ice will be different 
this time.

The sisterhood 
of carnage 
century


T

he mattress section of Art 
Van Furniture looks like an 
upscale prison — long rows of 
stripped beds, designated strips of plas-
tic to place your feet, employees mean-
dering through the aisles as guards. I 
visited the store in Canton for the first 
time while mattress shopping with my 
mother a week before moving into my 
new college apartment. That’s when I 
met Jeffrey, Mattress Salesman Extraor-
dinaire.
Jeffrey was a little too excited about 
mattresses. His face lit up when he 
explained the difference between foam 
and springs, how the foam is actually 
sturdier than the coils I’d been sleep-
ing on for years. But being just over 100 
pounds, it was natural that I couldn’t 
feel a difference in the two mattresses he 
had me try out. Jeffrey, in his “I-went-
to-business-school” voice, had me try 
out at least three more. 
“Okay, but this one…,” “You know, the 
price of this queen mattress is unparal-
leled…,” “Actually, I know this is the one 
you’re looking for. …”
I still didn’t have a preference. 
Jeffrey sighed as he sat down next to 
me, sweaty, and asked, “Well, then can I 
ask a personal question?” Without wait-
ing for an answer, he asked it anyway.
“What type of men are you interested 
in?”
Shocked, I didn’t respond. Jeffery 
continued to compare my body type to 
his wife’s and pointed out their foam 
mattress doesn’t move her side of the 
bed when he gets up for work, despite 
their 200-pound weight difference. He 
explained if I didn’t have a preference 
between mattresses, I should “think 
about what would work best for my 
future husband’s body type” — and if I 
knew what that would be, I could “accu-
rately choose to fit his needs.”
I think about this day a lot. As a femme 
woman, people often assume that I’m 
straight and looking for a partner. Fam-
ily members often ask whether or not I 

have found a new boyfriend yet, think-
ing it’s been enough time since my last 
long-term relationship that I’d be in the 
market for someone new. What if they 
knew I’m bisexual and not looking for a 
relationship at all?
My last boyfriend — whose 
middle name was Jeffrey, 
ironically enough — is to 
thank for getting me to this 
point. When I told him I might 
be attracted to women during 
my junior year of high school, he 
felt threatened and assumed I was 
going to cheat on him with my col-
lege roommate. For the entire three 
years we were together, I pushed 
the thought out of my head and 
assumed I had “chosen a side” 
by being with him. For a while, 
I really thought we were going 
to get married — until I real-
ized I’d given up all of my 
independence for him.
I took the bus to his col-
lege and ended it before I 
could change my mind. And 
afterward, I felt like the most 
powerful person in the world. 
I joined new clubs, wrote 
music, spent more time with my 
friends and went on trips with 
the money I would’ve spent on 
bus tickets to see him. I start-
ed going on dates with women 
for the first time. The thought 
of tying myself down to a man 
again felt ridiculous.
But according to the rest 
of the world, I was supposed 
to want to do it all over again. 
Women are supposed to thrive 
in the Art Van Furniture Store, 
eyes lingering over curated 
showrooms that seem to repre-
sent the perfect life. We should 
want the living room with navy 
leather chairs and a rustic coffee 
table, ready to hold a conversation 
that never develops past small talk; 

the burgundy loveseat where a married 
couple may share a glass of wine after 
work; the kitchen table for a family of 
four. I saw how my mother looked while 
walking through the showrooms, sure-
ly 
making 
mental 

notes about which pieces would match 
our living room.
When I walk through the mattress 
section at Art Van it feels exactly the 
same way it looks: a prison. Buying fur-
niture for a hypothetical self would 
be like locking myself up 
for life because I might 
one day commit a crime. 
Buying a mattress for my 
future partner means I’ll 
be sleeping next to an empty 
void for the next decade or so, 
just waiting for someone to fill 
the spot next to me. But maybe I 
don’t want to get married — and, 
if I do, there’s a fair chance it 
will be to a woman and not until 
long after my college mat-
tress will have worn out.
I never answered Jef-
frey’s question. Instead, I 
bought a double bed rath-
er than the queen size he 
had recommended. I left 
through the sliding doors 
with my mother, receipt in 
hand, feeling like Princess 
Leia escaping from Jab-
ba’s Palace. I even had my 
hair tied into space buns to 
match.
When the delivery men 
dropped off my mattress a 
week later, it was the first 
time I was alone in my new 
apartment. I watched their 
truck struggle to pull out of 
my tiny driveway and waited 
until they were out of sight 
to test out the new bed. I 
stretched out my body so it 
took up the entire mattress, 
fingertips reaching towards 
the edges and toes touching 
the corners. I let myself sink 
into the foam. 
This bed is my double for a 
single, and it’s all mine.

Modern Love: Should I buy a mattress for 
my future husband?

BY HANNAH BRAUER, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

ILLUSTRATION BY MAGGIE HUANG


I 

woke up Sunday morning with faint 
images of a happy dream lingering 
in my brain. I couldn’t remember 
exactly what it was about, but I knew it had 
involved flying motorcycles. And being at 
peace. 
“Good morning, love,” Finn said. 
“Good morning!” I responded, grinning 
and stretching out my arms to hug him. 
“You ready for work today?”
“I guess so. Gotta love the Sunday to 
Thursday schedule,” he said.
I was not ready for work. The day before 
I’d followed along as the details of the 
horrific shooting at a Walmart in El Paso 
unfolded in news coverage and press brief-
ings. The night of the shooting, as Finn and 
I rode the New York City Metro to see Once 
Upon A Time...in Hollywood at the theater, 
I looked out the window and wondered if 
this movie would be my last. 
I was interning at USA TODAY, and, as 
Sunday’s only breaking news intern, I knew 
my day would be filled with the shooting’s 
aftermath — with the livestreamed press 
conferences, the terrifying footage of shots 
fired, the endless “thoughts and prayers” 
tweets.
“I have to tell you something,” Finn said. 
“There was another mass shooting last 
night. In Dayton. Nine people died.”
I turned away and closed my eyes. I took 
a deep breath and tried to will myself back 
to sleep. I didn’t want to face the world and 
I especially didn’t want to report on it.
Finn put his arms around me and kissed 
the top of my head. 
“I know, love. I know.” 
He understood. We all do. We’re part of 
a generation where mass shootings are the 
norm in our country, a fact of life that every 
few weeks or so will pop up in our push 
notifications. Sometimes, I’ve felt almost 
numb to it — until it hits close to home. 
March 16, 2019 started out as an ordi-
nary day in Ann Arbor. Well, not totally 
ordinary. It was St. Patrick’s weekend, 
everyone was wildly drunk at frat parties, 
and rumor had it that Sasha Obama was 
visiting. For the most part, though, it was 
a typical college Saturday. I went out with 
some friends during the day, ate a much-
needed quesadilla at BTB and went home 
for a refreshing nap. 
Nada texted our group chat, reminding 
everyone to come to the vigil in the Diag 
for the victims of the recent shooting at 
the mosques in Christchurch, New Zea-
land. When I woke up, Finn and I met and 
headed over with our backpacks, planning 
to study for our upcoming midterms after. 
When we got there, I found my friends 
standing together holding plastic candles. 
I hugged Nada, and then squeezed into 

the crowd next to Soraya, who promptly 
grabbed my hand. In front of me, I saw 
Amara. We smiled at each other.
The vigil was powerful. I stood there 
silently, still grasping Soraya’s hand. As 
people got up to speak, sharing poems, 
terrorism statistics and the list of those 
killed, I imagined the pain and terror of 
the mosque-goers in Christchurch. I imag-
ined that whatever grief and fear I feel, the 
Muslim community on campus felt it even 
more. Then, all of a sudden, I was running 
for my life.
I heard campus police officers shouting 
“MOVE! MOVE!” and I saw people scat-
ter. Soraya’s hand was ripped from mine, 
and I saw Finn standing ahead of me. He 
grabbed my arm and yelled at me to run. It 
clicked in my head that someone probably 
had a gun and I ran. I accidentally bumped 
into another girl and whispered “I’m so 
sorry, I have to keep moving.” 
We ran two blocks, then three, as an 
ambulance whizzed past. My mind jumped 
to blood and death and injury, and I felt 
my heart sink and a desire to scream. Finn 
kept dragging me along, but I told him, my 
throat raw, that I couldn’t run anymore. 
At that moment, I saw Annika walking 
in our direction. She was late to the vigil, 
and she looked at our horrified faces with 
bemusement.
“What happened?” she asked. 
I could barely get the words out. There 
may be a shooter, people might be hurt 
and we don’t know where the rest of our 
friends are. Annika still looked confused, 
and pulled out her phone to see if any of our 
friends had texted. 
“We can’t just stand out here, let’s go! 
Right now!” Finn yelled, bringing us 
back to reality. 
So, we ran all the way down State 
Street and into the Ford School. As soon 
as we entered the building, the reporter 
in me kicked in. I checked my phone 
and saw dozens of text messages from 
people in my clubs and my roommates. 
People on campus were confused and 
terrified, and alerts from the University 
weren’t coming fast enough. I knew I 
had to do something. 
Finn, Annika and I piled into a class-
room with a bunch of other people who 
had been having some conference in 
the building, people who at first were 
confused by our frantic faces and then 
heard the reports of a possible active 
shooter. We sat in the back, listening to 
the police scanner and whispering. 
Mostly to keep my terrified thoughts 
at bay, I dove into action. Editor in Chief 
Maya, my co-Managing News Editor 
Grace, the Senior News Editors and I 

texted frantically, trying to find out what 
had happened, praying no one was hurt. 
We split up tasks and people to call, we 
started a Google Doc, but frankly, we didn’t 
know what to do. This wasn’t some abstract 
event we were covering as student journal-
ists. This concerned our friends’ lives and 
our own. 
Eventually, it became clear that this was 
a false alarm, and that everyone was, at least 
physically, okay. About three hours after the 
initial scare, police declared an all-clear. I 
holed up in my room and wrote the story 
as quickly as I could, scanning social media 
and conducting phone interviews. 
I stayed in the thick of it, reliving every 
second of the afternoon, until Maya pub-
lished the story online. It was only later 
that night when the reality of the day fully 
hit me. 
I laid in bed, and when I closed my eyes, 
I imagined what would have happened if 
someone had shot into the crowd. What if 
I had lost someone I loved forever? What 
if someone I didn’t know, someone full of 
youth and promise, had been killed? And 
what if I had had to report on it, asking 
their closest friends to tell me about an 
unthinkable loss? 
The journalist adrenaline keeping me 
afloat dissipated and I broke down. How 
does anyone do this work without feel-
ing crippled by the horror around them? I 
didn’t want to be a journalist — I wanted 
to curl into a ball and sink further into my 
bed. 
In the aftermath of the scare, The Daily 
dealt with the consequences of sending 
out tweets with unconfirmed informa-
tion, ultimately writing an apology letter 

and refining our news emergency protocol. 
The News Section wrote a follow-up story 
on the particular terror felt by the Muslim 
community. I helped a team of reporters 
write about the University’s emergency 
alert system. For the rest of the week I felt 
off, shaking at loud noises and suspicious 
figures. 
But then I grew angry. News broke about 
mass shootings almost daily, and with each 
death toll, I felt my helplessness slowly turn 
into resolve. If no one reported on the vio-
lence, reminding people in power of every 
tragic death, nothing was going to change. 
Without persistent conversations on cam-
pus and push from students, the Univer-
sity felt pressure to improve its emergency 
notifications. Someday, maybe, this could 
finally register with national leaders. 
So that summer Sunday morning, I 
pulled myself together and got myself to 
work. I faced the grueling details of the 
weekend’s shootings. After work, I dis-
tracted myself with the second season of 
Fleabag. 
Later that week, I watched from home 
as my coworkers were evacuated from USA 
TODAY headquarters after an active shoot-
er scare. I thought about how scheduling a 
doctor’s appointment that day might have 
saved my life. And I felt a massive wave of 
relief when everyone was safe. 
Every once in a while, even at the start 
of this school year, I glance at The Diag and 
remember the screams as people sprinted 
in all directions. I remember the sinking 
terror and adrenaline that consumed me. 
I hope that no one has to experience that 
fear again. But I know for the foreseeable 
future, that fear isn’t going anywhere.

Into the chaos: Facing gun violence as a 
student reporter

T

he century is young, but not 
naive. Ask any person you know, 
who inherited its turn, about its 
carnage. They might recall for you mass 
shootings and gun violence, or catalogues 
of assaulted women around the world who 
are forced to hide, or mounting xenophobia 
worldwide. They might tell you about 
genocides and civil wars, naming Syria 
and Sudan on a long list of their griefs. 
Make no mistake that promises made in 
the 2000s are tied to guns, wrapped in 
disrepair, and stacked alongside economic 
hardship and nationalist violence. Make 
no mistake that the century has been one 
of carnage. Millennials have survivor’s 
guilt just by being alive. 
But be alive we must. 
I moved to Delhi for a summer at 20 and 
was welcomed by triple-digit temperatures 
that held me like the swaddle of a woolen-
blanket. The cab ride from the airport 
north was a long journey, with traffic in a 
dozen lanes at a near standstill for hours. I 
was not bothered by the delay, enraptured 
instead by the breadth of movement on the 
streets — busses and trucks, motorcycles 
filled beyond capacity, cows and their 
herders, open-air rickshaws, and sellers 
of fruits all sharing the lanes. I felt 
charmed by the functioning of a system 
which moved with a set of rules I had 
yet to understand. “This is why we have 
bad air in Delhi,” the driver said, “too 
much traffic.” Still, I found the roads 
miraculous, density and all. As we passed 
through the city, he informed me of the 
sight on my right, which without affection 
he called “trash mountain.” The Ghazipur 
landfill, I would learn, was rivaling the 
Taj Mahal in height.
I remember June for its late dinners of 
paneer paratha and steaming chai at the 
local dhaba, where a sisterhood was born 
among women with immeasurable dignity, 
strength, and certainty — each woman 
an opus of her own. Among the sisters 
was Aditi, who always saw things as they 
were, and graced every conversation with 
a quiet knowingness only she had. Tanya 
was bold and unafraid and brought out 
others’ truths by admitting to her own. 
Vishi could impose levity at any moment, 
conjurable only by a quick and pointed 

humor like hers. Nivedita used historical 
fact to invoke in us a contemplation of our 
ethics, reminding us of our situation in the 
broader arc of humankind. Meghna gave 
us anecdotes laden with a deep sincerity, 
and Garuika’s habitual thoughtfulness 
combined with her embrace of freedom 
made her a fast friend to any lucky enough 
to know her. My worthiness for sitting 
at the table could be contested, and my 
frequent inability to fulfill its social graces 
goes undisputed, but the chorus which 
resounded from our coming together grew 
only louder, clearer and more melodious 
with each passing day.
Many breezeless nights we spent on 
the dhaba’s lawn, sometimes in shared 
quiet contemplation and others loud 
laughter. We joined together in the way 
sisters often come to unite: by exchanging 
stories of our liberation. Praises we sung 
for our independent journeys toward 
self-fulfillment, 
consensual 
intimacy 
and political freedom. “What a queen!” 
someone would say, and the rest of us would 
coo in support. Bound in these stories of 
small victories we’ve accumulated toward 
our autonomy were the harsh anecdotes 
of assault that we, too, have accumulated. 
But a bruised sister in a sisterhood heals, 
and their company made Delhi a home 
without fear.
This isn’t to say the city was entirely 
free of danger. Heavily armed officials 
and being alone in night alleys brought 
their risks. It seems that no matter 
what corner of the world we sit in, the 
unlikelihood of our survival against the 
forces-that-be seems something worth 
celebrating. To be 20 in this era is to ask, 
“why did the gunman skip my school, and 
the movie theatre I attended? Why must it 
be my democracy, and these borders? By 
what accident was I born inland? By what 
accident born at all?” 
Each of us has a fragile body that 
somehow makes it out alive every day, 
damaged as we are, by similar forces of 
patriarchy or poverty or grief. None of us 
is spared, but some of us, it seems, entirely 
by accident, have dodged the worst of 
it. I know the world is unequal in its 
distribution of pain, and that my share has 
been comparatively small. But no matter 

what size slice of the ache we’ve been 
dished, we’ve all been dished it and — if 
you’re reading this — been spared some 
of it. 
And yet, despite our perseverance thus 
far, some forces will not spare a single one 
of us. The grief which looms, casting its 
shadow on the unfolding 21st century, is 
climate change.
Not a day passed in Delhi without 
reference 
to 
some 
climate-induced 
ailment. For those living through the 
Carnage Century in an air-conditioned, 
Western home with plentiful water and 
clean air, the conversation may seem 
confined to the dystopia of late-night 
news. But in India, where a single summer 
bred witnesses to a deadly month-long 
heat wave, an outbreak of Encephalitis 
claiming over 200 childrens’ lives in 
Bihar, Chennai’s fatal water shortage, and 
unbreathable air suffocating the capital, 
the conversation is a staple.
India’s complexity mimics that of the 
new century, riddled with paradoxes and 
imposing on us a cognitive dissonance 
we must perpetually untangle. The 
century knows both heat waves and the 
polar vortex; India itself fends off floods 
and droughts simultaneously. Paradox is 
written into millennials’ way of life. In 
every corner of the world, insufferable 
pain and unimaginable beauty walk hand 
in hand.
Yes, alongside Carnage Century’s aches 
are its gifts, too numerous to count and 
too frequent to forget. Take for instance 
Tanya’s 
20th 
birthday. 
She 
danced 
through the night, friends in tow, glowing 
with a joy unparalleled. How beauty 
pervades! That night, she blocked all 
climate change tags from her social media. 
“My gift to myself,” she said proudly, “is 
to pretend for a single day that it isn’t 
happening.” (The next morning, she said 
grimly, “Back to reality,” and the tagged 
news flooded back in.) Another afternoon, 
Gauri and I were sharing ice creams, the 
sweetness of mango rivaling all other 
modes of refreshment, when she laughed 
and said, “At least I don’t have to plan for 
60. I mean have you ever even pictured it? 
Being so old?” I hadn’t. “It’s only going to 
get worse, you know,” she said morosely, 

slurping sweet pulp from her cup. “More 
violent. I didn’t sign up for going through 
what we’ll have to go through.” How pain 
pervades.
An undying sense of entitlement in the 
generation before mine makes it hard to 
believe that young people can remark 
about their short, climate-bound lifespans. 
Gen-Xers assume they will have long lives, 
actively plan for them, and feel slighted by 
any mention of potential ruin. 
“I’ve always wanted to live there,” Vishi 
said about the islands near the country’s 
southern coast. It was another dhaba 
lunch, the paneer gloriously thick and the 
chutney miraculously spicy. This was my 
classic order at the neighborhood hut, and 
I ate it with such focus that I often lost 
my sense of time in conversation around 
me. “Then no Ph.D. for you,” Gaurika 
retorted. “I give them five years before 
they go under.” Suddenly swallowing was 
a challenge. I pried about the question of 
choosing a place to live. “It’s just a choice we 
make,” Tanya said. “If I’m not asthmatic, 

perhaps I’ll pick Delhi, and willingly give 
up that decade I thought I’d have, had the 
air quality not prematurely destroyed my 
lungs.” I nodded. “But, maybe, instead I 
risk it on Bombay, which gives me at least 
a decade before the sea takes it back. Not 
enough time for children, but who wanted 
those anyway?” No matter which way 
you spin it, we’re running a race against 
time and circumstance that’s stacked 
against us, and stacked unfavorably 
for those in places dense with careless 
multinational corporations, coastal cities 
and unbalanced ratios of populations and 
resources. 
Weeks later, I traveled south to Mumbai 
where monsoon season was in full force. 
Refreshing, hot rains soaked me to my 
bones. 
We 
played, 
laughed, 
danced. 
Strolling by the ocean was an untamable 
joy, though momentary, for the dangers 
were pronounced.

Stopped railways, canceled flights, pollutants 
lurking in deep street water and innumerable 
car crashes dotted the city. Before I was to travel 
farther, Vishi called to warn me of the floods and 
wish me safety. My dance turned to a tiptoe.
I’m still learning how to understand my 
experience in a world bent into paradoxes. Am 
I allowed to love it? Am I allowed to mourn it? 
Cities made unlivable by the forces of the century 
are stacked, too, with breathtaking landscapes 
and a heritage so rich, ancient and particular that 
all other parts of the world pale in comparison. 
Must beauty and pain walk hand-in-hand?
At the end of July, I went to a posh concert 
hall tucked in the city’s southside with Garui 
and Nivedita. On the way there, we piled onto 
each other on the rickshaw—some rules I was 
beginning to understand. Ditty, a spoken-word 
poet and musician extraordinaire, sang gorgeous 
melodies with captivating lyrics about the slow 
dying of the planet. We drank sweet, red wine 
and listened to her Eulogy of a Sparrow. My heart 
felt full, and laden with the ache of awareness. 
If I report to you the world beautiful, will you 
think me naive? If, instead, I paint the world 
with its ails, will you blame me for not looking 
hard enough? 
I don’t know how we will greet our existential 
crisis as it knocks on the door. I don’t know 
whose door it will come to first, or if it has been 
knocking and we have been telling it we aren’t 
home. I only know the knocks will get louder as 
well as more persistent with time, 
and we’ll need to hold one another 
close when they come to stay.
On my last Saturday in Delhi, 
Tanya squeezed my hand while 
I added three piercings to my 
already-decorated 
ears. 
I 
am 
always afraid of how it will hurt. I 
imagine it unbearable, asking the 
piercer repeatedly to tell me the 
length of time I will experience 
pain. (He always exaggerates.) And 
I emerge smiling, ears anew, friends 
close. I know that being loved and 
heard in Carnage Century does not 
make pain obsolete, but does make 
it bearable. 
The decade has made each of us 
witness to emerging recklessness 
and greed, as well as unquantifiable 
technological 
advances 
for 
connectivity and meaning. Neither 
the ills nor joys of the era can be 
totaled (though those of us in 
empirics keep trying). Many days, 
the aches grip us, sometimes 
prompting awareness and action, 
and 
sometimes 
only 
apathy. 
Still other days remind us how 
much goodness persists without 
our asking it to. Luckily for us, 
alongside destruction and grief 
have emerged sisterhoods, thick 
enough to withstand the melting 
century. 

If instead 
I paint the 
world with its 
ails, will you 
blame me for 
not looking 
hard enough?

F

or me, reading someone else’s 
words, or formulating thoughts 
in my own mind, was never 
enough; I always had to write it down on 
paper. Writing my own stories made the 
simple descriptions come alive, placing 
me in a different world of my own 
choosing. Microsoft Word became my 
escape hatch from the doldrums of my 
humdrum life in suburban New Jersey. 
Finding my own life to be too boring, 
I put myself in the place of people I 
wanted to be, even for a day. Using 
various movies and television shows as 
inspiration, I created new worlds filled 
with fascinating characters, either by 
reaching back into the past or extending 
into the future. I dovetailed my desire 
to write with my budding interest in 
history, attempting to see what life 
was like in a different era by recreating 
it on paper. I would base stories off of 
Sherlock Holmes in order to understand 
life in Victorian England. I would write 
a murder mystery based off real events 
in 1940s Los Angeles to recreate the Noir 
Era. I would put myself in the shoes of an 
American soldier in Afghanistan (mixed 
with some futuristic Frankenstein-like 
technology) to try and see the conflict 
that has been raging nearly all my life. 
And, by putting myself in a different 
place, I tried to discover the underlying 
emotions in things I did not experience 
much in everyday life: grief, tragedy, 
loss. 
Despite 
my 
escapist 
desires, 
however, the one story that sticks out in 
my mind actually became a reflection 
of my own life, allowing me to connect 
more deeply with the experiences I had 
in this world.
One day, my teacher gave us an 
assignment to write a story from the 
perspective of an inanimate object. I 
ended up writing from the perspective 
of a baseball, since baseball was my 
favorite sport growing up. I played 
baseball from kindergarten up until 
seventh grade. Some of my fondest and 
earliest memories recount me posing in 
a high school gym with my bat in hand 
and crisp yellow tee-ball uniform on. My 
dad and I bonded in our shared devotion 
to the New York Mets, even though 
they constantly disappointed us with 
stunning collapses or outright bad play. 
We would watch every game, whether 
they were in the cellar or on their way 
to the World Series. The minute spring 
came, my dad and I would try out my 
new glove in the backyard, prepping 
for my own season. Even though I quit 
playing in eighth grade (and I often 
regret that I didn’t put enough effort 
towards the game), it still holds a special 
place in my heart. Ironically, a baseball 

was the perfect vehicle to express 
feelings of tragedy and loss, since I was 
most familiar with that object, and it 
held meaning far beyond the red laces 
for my own childhood.
Though a baseball is just any old 
object, I tried to inject as much feeling 
as I could into its own thoughts. I 
recounted the trepidation the baseball 
had sitting in a bin with hundreds of 
other similar looking baseballs, worried 
that no one would ever buy it. I recalled 
how nervousness filled the entirety of its 
sphere as the new owner held it, unsure 
whether he would treat him better than 
the salespeople. I described how panic 
consumed it as it wondered whether it 
would be relegated to another dustbin. 
In the bin, it was just another object, 
faceless and meaningless. In a kid’s 
baseball glove, it brought joy to the boy’s 
face, nurturing his love of the game. The 
boy would recognize and appreciate it, 
understanding how much joy it brought 
to him. These feelings were my way of 
expressing my own trepidation about 
growing up. I was painfully shy and 
reserved in social interaction, loathe to 
reveal any personal reservations I had 

about myself. My constant worry about 
meaning something to another person, 
to not just be another soul walking 
the earth, were encapsulated in this 
baseball.
Though seemingly a minor object, 
this one baseball alone had significant 
events in its existence, which I tried to 
convey in the grandest terms possible. 
It faced a winding journey from the 
bottom of a sporting goods store bin, 
to a boy’s shelf in his room, to the 
dustbin many years later. It faced many 
threats to its survival, from its spot 
in the bottom in the bin, to the boy 
growing up and cleaning out his room 
of childhood objects. However, the 
baseball withstood it all. Why? 
Well, it wasn’t just any baseball. It 
was the last object the father got for his 
son before he died in the Twin Towers 
on 9/11. (Admittedly, I got some of the 
ideas from the trailer for “Extremely 
Loud and Incredibly Close,” with the 
key switched out for a baseball.) 
Looking back, this story presented a 
tragic version of what-could-have-been 
for my own life. My own father was in 
New York City on 9/11, sitting on the 

train as he watched the towers burn. 
He, somehow, made it on the last train 
back to New Jersey, even after he took 
the time to go to Virgin Records for 
a new Bob Dylan CD (which earned a 
stern reprimand from my mother). This 
story was my way of being thankful 
for having my father be there all those 
years, nurturing my love for baseball. 
Instead of having a baseball stand in for 
my father, he was always there, ready to 
catch my throws. I never had to throw 
pop ups to myself, or always run after 
the ball; my dad was there to do it for 
me. Especially since there were not 
many kids in my neighborhood, having 
my father was a lifesaver. Just saying 
“thank you” to my dad for being there 
would have never been adequate; writing 
allowed me to express that gratitude. By 
writing from the perspective of another 
boy who had the same childhood in 
nearly every way save one, I was able 
to fully appreciate the impact my own 
father had on my development, and why 
baseball is such an important facet of 
my own character.
