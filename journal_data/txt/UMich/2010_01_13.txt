STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE
'U' mulls
changes
to student
health plan

DETROIT ON DISPLAY

Officials want more
healthy people to
enroll in plan to
stem rising costs
By DARRYN FITZGERALD
Daily Staff Reporter
As lawmakers in Washington
work toward a national health
care overhaul, University Health
Service officials are discussing the
restructuring of students' insur-
ance plans for the next five years.
The Michigan Student Assem-
bly's Student Health Insurance
Committee and UHS Student
Insurance officials are currently
in the process of deciding to either
revamp or replace the health insur-
ance plan offered through the Uni-
versity, which has been affected
by rising health care costs, despite
University efforts to stem those
increases.
The student health insurance
premium went up to $1,000 in
the early 2000s, dissuading stu-
dents from buying the University's
option, Robert Winfield, the direc-
tor of UHS said. As the premium
price continued to rise, healthy
people continued to drop out of
the plan, leaving a group of policy-
holders who caused the number of
claims per individual to increase.
"It progressively became more

and more expensive until itgot into
the $2,000 range," Winfield said.
The University's current policy,
which is covered by the health
insurance provider Aetna, costs
students an annual premium total-
ing $2,490.
Before the national health care
bills were being seriously negoti-
ated in Congress, UHS administra-
tors and student officials on MSA's
SHIC had worked extensively to
create a new policy that would
require all students to come to
campus with health insurance.
"But then the financial crisis
came, and there wasn't sufficient
financial aid to do that," Winfield
said.
Economic restrictions coupled
with the passage of the Senate
health care bill have led Univer-
sity officials to postpone efforts to
increase healthy enrollment in the
Aetna plan and require all students
to be insured.
"While I was pushing hard a
year ago for required level health
insurance for students, now I rec-
ommend to wait and see what hap-
pens," Winfield said. "It may just
be something that is out of our
hands."
Whether the ultimate health
care bill will mandate all citizens
to have health insurance has yet
to be determined, but if it does, it
would greatly affect the Universi-
ty's negotiations for student health

Landlord says he
'plans to hold
onto the site'
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily Staff Reporter
More than two months after
a fire ravaged the former Pinball
Pete's location on South University
Avenue, the spot where the aban-
doned building used to stand is a
little more than dirt lot covered in
straw.
And, the property owned by

Dennis Tice may stay that way for
a while.
Prior to the demolition, Tice
told The Michigan Daily that he
had been looking to sell the prop-
erty for five months before the fire
occurred. At the time of demoli-
tion - which took place over win-
ter break - Tice was in talks with
a developer about what to do with
the property, but he couldn't dis-
close further information.
Tice, who also owns Pizza
House on Church Street, told the
Daily in an e-mail interview yes-
terday that he currently plans to
"hold onto the site."

Stewart Beal, president of JC
Beal Construction, was hired by
Tice to demolish the remains of
the building - which was mostly
destroyed in the fire - on Dec.
26. He said the demolition was
delayed two days until Dec. 28
because landfills were closed for
the weekend.
Once the week began, Beal said
demolition went as planned with-
out complications, even though
the construction closed portions
of South University Avenue.
The project was completed and
the street reopened by Jan. 8, only
two days behind the initial sched-

ule.
Beal said he had not yet spoken
with Tice about any future devel-
opment of the lot.
The former location of Pinball
Pete's became a ruin after it was
ravaged by the Oct. 24 fire. Two
homeless men, Justin Arens and
Ian MacKenzie were charged with
starting the blaze that lasted for
hours as firefighters struggled
to keep it under control. The fire
destroyed the structure andcaused
minor damages to both University
Towers and Momo Tea.

State official says
p marijuana 'not the
answer' to Mich.'s
economic woes
By BETHANY BIRON
 Daily StaffReporter
With the recent openings of
two medical marijuana centers in
Southeast Michigan, advocates of
medical marijuana speculate that
the legalization of medical mari-

juana might blossom into a bus-
tling industry that could help boost
Michigan's ailingeconomy.
But state officials say the drug's
legalization isn't the answer to the
state's economic woes.
Proposal 1, which was passed
by 63 percent of voters in the Nov.
2008 election, legalized the drug
for medical use. The law also
allows Michigan citizens to apply
to become either patients or care-
givers, who can grow plants for
those who have a medical mari-
juana card.
Anthony Freed, executive direc-

tor of the Michigan Medical Mari-
juana Chamber of Commerce and
founder of a new medical canna-
bis center that opened in Ypsilanti
on the first of this month, said the
center has the potential to play an
important role in fixing the state of
Michigan's economy.
Freed's center - which is serv-
ing its maximum number of clients
and has 400 people on the waitlist
- evaluates people to assess their
need for a medical marijuana card
and has a "compassion club" or
patient support group that meets

For the Daily
United States Ambassador to
Russia John Beyrle spoke at the
University's Alumni Center yes-
terday to advocate attempts by
the U.S. government to bolster
relations between the two coun-
tries.
A roughly 120-person audi-
ence, filled every available seat
in the Founders Room, as the
ambassador discussed the "reset"
- a term coined by President
Barack Obama's administration
to describe strategic efforts to
improve relations between Rus-
sia and the United States.
In his speech, Beyrle explained
that strengthening relations
between the two countries would
be vital for the United States in
upcoming years, because both
countries hold strong political
positions in the international
community.
"A productive, constructive
relationship between the United
States and Russia is essential for
the national interests of the Unit-
ed States," Beyrle said.

DEARBORN, Mich.
Dog owner pleads
guilty to animal
cruelty
A man who had hundreds of
live and dead Chihuahuas and
Chihuahua mixes in his Detroit-
area home has pleaded guilty to
an animal cruelty charge in a deal
that keeps him out of prison.
Fifty-six-year-old Kenneth
Lang Jr. of Dearborn made the
plea yesterday in Wayne County
Circuit Court. He had faced up to
four years in prison.
Under the deal, Lang gets five
years' probation, may not own
animals and must pay $3,000
restitution to the Animal Legal
Defense Fund.
In July, authorities found Lang
was hoarding the dogs. They say
some dead dogs in freezers in the
home may have been killed with
an injection.
Defense lawyer James Schmier
says his client needs treatment
for an obsessive-compulsive dis-
order.
KANSAS CITY
Woman unhappy
with McDonald's
cheeseburger
A woman has been charged
with trashing a McDonald's res-
taurant in Missouri because she
was unhappy with her cheese-
burger. Police said they received
many tips after releasing video of
the Dec. 27 incident.
In the video, which has been
viewed hundreds of thousands of
times online, a customer is seen
throwing a sign and a water dis-
penser over a counter and pushing
three cash registers to the floor.
Yesterday, the Jackson Coun-
ty prosecutor's office charged
19-year-old Alesha McMullen of
Kansas City with Class D felony
property damage. It wasn't imme-
diately known if McMullen has an
attorney. A phone listing for her
could not be found.
Police say McMullen told offi-
cers her order was prepared
wrong and the restaurant refused
to give her a refund.

j U.S. pilots face
charges in Brazil
A Brazilian appeals court has
ruled two American executive
jet pilots should face negligence
 charges for a 2006 midair colli-
sion that killed 154 people.
The ruling overturns a judge
lwho dismissed those charges in
2008 against Joseph Lepore of
Bay Shore, New York, and Jan
Paladino of Westhampton Beach,
New York.
Defense lawyer Joel Weiss said
yesterday he would likely appeal
the new decision.
The executive jet collided over
the Amazon with a Boeing 737 on
Sept. 29, 2006 - killing all aboard
the Boeing.
Prosecutors accused the pilots

of accidentally turning off a tran-
sponder that transmitted the
smaller jet's location and failing
to follow their flight plan. Weiss
says Brazilian controllers set the
planes on a collision course.
TOKYO
Man kills 2 patrons
 in Japanese bar
A man opened fire at a bar in
western Japan yesterday, killing
two people and wounding one
seriously before taking his own
life.
Guns are strictly controlled
in Japan, and shootings are rare.
When such attacks do occur, they
are often linked to gangsters
known as yakuza.
Police in Habikino City in
Osaka prefecture were inves-
tigating the gunman's motive,
police official Mitsuyuki Oda
said. The Kyodo News agency said
the gunman was a city employee
and could have been targeting
his mother-in-law as a result of a
family dispute. Police are trying
to confirm if an elderly women
who was killed was a relative of
the gunman.
Both the elderly woman and a
man in his 20s were pronounced
dead at a hospital. A man in his
5s is in critical condition, Oda
said.
Oda said the gunman - identi-
fied as 49-year-old Yasuhisa Sugi-
ura - was also pronounced dead
at the hospital.

Regent Ilitch exploring
gubernatorial bid, had
meeting at White House

President
Obama asks
Congress for
more war funds

After Lt. Gov. drops
out of Democratic
race, nomination
is wide open
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
University of Michigan Regent
Denise Ilitch met yesterday with
White House officials to explore
a possible Democratic bid for
Michigan governor.
Ilitch, whose father owns the
Detroit Red Wings and Tigers,
met with staff there Tuesday,
with President Barack Obama
"stopping by the meeting,"
according to a White House offi-
cial.
The official spoke on the con-
dition of anonymity because of
not being authorized to discuss
the matter publicly.
Denise Ilitch is not the first
Michigan gubernatorial hopeful
to meet with White House staff,
and the meeting indicates the

White House has not yet settled
on a favorite. Obama is keeping
an eye on the contest in this bat-
tleground state, which he doesn't
want to see slide into GOP hands
as New Jersey and Virginia did
last year.
Several Democrats are look-
ing closely at the race now that
presumptive Democratic front-
runner Lt. Gov. John Cherry has
withdrawn, including House
Speaker Andy Dillon and Lan-
sing Mayor Virg Bernero. Both
have set up committees to raise
money and explore a possible
run.
Ilitch has not established
an exploratory committee, but
could set one up soon. A lawyer
who owns Ambassador Maga-
zine and Denise Ilitch Designs,
she brings a combination of
business and political experi-
ence that could make her a good
choice to replace Gov. Jennifer
Granholm.
State Rep. Alma Wheeler
Smith has been in the hunt for

the Democratic nomination
since mid-2009 and Sen. Han-
sen Clarke was the first to jump
in last week after Cherry with-
drew. U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak, for-
mer Genesee County Treasurer
Dan Kildee and Michigan State
University Trustee George Per-
les are among other Democrats
contemplating a run.
Yesterday marked the end of
the governor's race for former
state Rep. John Freeman. Like
Cherry, he cited problems raising
money as the reason he dropped
out, noting in a statement that
"the amount of money required
to runa viable campaign was out
of reach."
Freeman served six years in
the state House representing the
area around Madison Heights
before leaving because of term
limits in 1998. He most recently
led a group pushing for changes
to health care in Michigan. He
announced his withdrawal from
the race on Facebook and Twit-
ter.

Additional $33 billion
would aid war efforts
in Iraq and Afghan.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Obama administration plans to
ask Congress for an additional
$33 billion to fight unpopular
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, on
top of a record request for $708
billion for the Defense Depart-
ment next year, The Associated
Press has learned.
The administration also plans
to tell Congress next month that
its central military objectives for
the next four years will include
winning the current wars while
preventing new ones and that its
core missions will include both
counterinsurgency and counter-
terrorism operations.
The administration's Qua-
drennial Defense Review, the
main articulation of U.S. military
doctrine, is due to Congress on
Feb. 1. Top military command-
ers were briefed on the document
at the Pentagon on Monday and
yesterday. They also received a
preview of the administration's
budget plans through 2015.
The four-year review outlines
six key mission areas and spells
out capabilities and goals the
Pentagon wants to develop. The
pilotless drones used for sur-
veillance and attack missions in
Afghanistan and Pakistan are a
priority, with a goal of speeding
up the purchase of new Reaper
drones and expansion of Preda-
tor and Reaper drone flights
through 2013.
The extra $33 billion in 2010
would mostly go toward the
expansion of the war in Afghani-
stan. Obama ordered an extra
30,000 troops for that war as part
of an overhaul of the war strategy
late last year.
The request for that additional
funding will be sent to Congress
at the same time as the record
spending request for next year,
making war funding an espe-

cially difficult pill for some of
Obama's Democratic allies.
Military officials have sug-
gested that the 2011 request
would top $700 billion for the
first time, but the precise figure
has not been made public.
U.S. officials outlined the
coming requests on condition of
anonymity because the budget
request will not be sent to Con-
gress until later this month.
Obama's request for more
war spending is likely to receive
support on Capitol Hill, where
Republicans will join moderate
Democrats to pass the bill.
But the budget debate is also
likely to expose a widening rift
between Obama's administra-
tion, - it sees more troops and
money as necessary to winning
the war - and Democratic lead-
ers, who have watched public
opinion turn against the mili-
tary campaign.
"The president's going to have
to make his case," House Speak-
er Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told
reporters last month at her year-
end briefing.
The 2010 budget contains
about $128 billion for military
operations in Iraq and Afghani-
stan.

Rescue teams sent
to Haiti civilians
facing disaster
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
U.S. yesterday was dispatching
disaster rescue teams to earth-
quake-stricken Haiti, where a U.S.
official said a "serious loss of life"
was expected.
President Barack Obama said
his thoughts and prayers were
with the people of Haiti and that
the U.S. stood ready to help the
impoverished Caribbean nation.
While telephone lines were
down in the Haitian capital of
Port-au-Prince and cell phone
communication was spotty, U.S.
officials there reported "signifi-
cant damage."
"There were some people (from
the embassy) in the city when
the earthquake first happened,"
State Department spokesman
P.J. Crowley said. "They reported
structures down. They reported
a lot of walls down. They did see
a number of bodies in the street
and on the sidewalk that had
been hit by debris. So clearly,
there's going to be serious loss of
life in this."
Frank Thorp, a retired rear
admiral who ran the Navy's public
information office until recently,
said he believed his daughter-in-
law was trapped in the rubble.
Thorp said he was told last night
that his son's wife, Jillian Thorp,
24, had used her cell phone to call
from help from a Haitian Minis-
tries mission house run by Nor-
wich.Missions based in Norwich,
Coon.

White House officials said
Obama had asked aides to make
sure U.S. personnel at the embassy
were safe. There are fewer than20
U.S. military personnel in Haiti,
largely working with the embassy
there. Officials said Obama told
them to start preparing in case
humanitarian assistance was
needed.
The State Department, the U.S.
Agency for International Develop-
ment and U.S. Southern Command
have started to coordinate. USAID
said it was sending a disaster
assistance response team and had
activated its partners, the Fairfax
County (Va.) Urban Search and
Rescue Team and the Los Angeles
County Search and Rescue Team.
USAID disaster experts also
would assist.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton said from Hono-
lulu that the U.S. was gathering
information about the quake and
its impact, and that the U.S. was
offering full assistance - civilian
and military - to Haiti.
Clinton spoke with the deputy
chief of U.S. Embassy in Port-au-
Prince, David Lindwall, before
making a speech in Honolulu.
"We have been in touch with
the embassy," State Department
spokesman Gordon Duguid said
in Washington. "They report
significant damage in town, but
the embassy is unaffected. The
embassy is workingto get in touch
with Haitian government as well
as trying to ... account for Ameri-
cans."
"Haitian phone lines are down
and cell phone coverage is under-
standably unreliable," he said.
The U.S. ambassador to Haiti

was in the country, but was at his
residence, which is in Petionville,
and the phones lines were out,
Duguid said. "The embassy is in
touch with ambassador via radio."
The State Department set up a
toll-free number to call for infor-
mation about family members
in Haiti: 1-888-407-4747. The
department said some callers may
receive a recording because of
heavy volume of calls.
"Our embassy is also trying to
make contact with the Haitian
government," Duguid said late
Tuesday. "There are emergency
meetings going on right now in
Washington to identify assets that
can be moved quickly into the
area. U.S. search and rescue teams
have been put on alert, and we are
trying to assess the status of the
airport. As President Obama has
said, we will assist in any way we
can."
"Our people in Haiti are literal-
ly in the dark," Crowley said. "And
now the people at the embassy
actually - they've got generators
there, so our embassy has to be
able to function," but with lim-
ited abilityto assess what has hap-
pened outside and how to-begin
sending assistance.
The Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance will be assembling a
team to send to Haiti, Crowley
said, including search and rescue
experts from the U.S.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., chair-
man of the House Foreign Affairs
Western Hemisphere subcommit-
tee, said, "This is the worst pos-
sible time for a natural disaster
in Haiti, a country which is still
recovering from the devastating
storms of just over a year ago."

Revitalizing education
Teaching fellowship is necessary investment in education
While the state continues to struggle with severe budget
cuts, the introduction of an education program may
spark a glimmer of hope for the state's recovery. On
Thursday, Gov. Jennifer Granholm and officials from six Michi-
gan colleges, including the University of Michigan, announced
the creation of a fellowship program to train students for their
master's degrees in education and place them in some of Michi-
gan's most underprivileged school districts. The program will
help to fill the needs of these struggling districts. The University
should encourage enrollment in the program and encourage the
state to expand its support to improve all levels of education.

The real Farmville

I

Perhaps you're familiar with
the Facebook sensation that's
sweeping the nation: Farm-
ville. For those of
you who aren't,
Farmville is like
"TheSims" video-
game, except it's
on Facebook. If the
number of people I
know who use it as
their primary pro-
crastination tool
is any indication, RACHEL
Farmville is awe- GLE
some. I don't play VAN GILDER
Farmville. And
here's why: I'm
actually from a farm. So for me, Farm-
ville is kind of like Keith Richards
playing "Rock Band."
My fellow college students seem to
think that harvesting virtual fields is
fantastic, but it's not exciting for me
because I've actually helped harvest
fields. There's no novelty. For me,
novelty is a city with more than one
stoplight. And though Ann Arbor isn't
a large city in the grand scheme of
things, to a girl from a town with only
one high school, Ann Arbor is practi-
cally Metropolis.
I hail from the great village of
Webberville, Michigan, not far out-
side of East Lansing. Population:
1,500 (give or take). My graduating
class numbered 51. I grew up on 80
acres of farmland that my father, an
engineer for General Motors, rents to
his cousin, a career farmer, to plant.
Usually, my father's cousin plants
corn or soy beans in our field. Very
rarely, he plants wheat, and then it's
like living inside a Pepperidge Farm
commercial.
When I tell people here at the Uni-
versity that I grew up on a farm, I
get all sorts of questions. Among my
favorites are: "Do you have, like, cows

and chickens and stuff?" and "OMG!
Do people drive their tractors to
school?" I usually answer questions
like this patiently, with a slight sense
of annoyance. In case you're curious,
my family doesn't own cows or chick-
ens, but we do own horses, and my
mother raises pigs.
And Webbervillians only drive our
tractors to school once a year on Drive
Your Tractor to School Day, sponsored
annually by the Webberville Chapter
of the FFA, which is a leadership orga-
nization based in agriculture. (This is
not a joke. This actually exists.)
The grand total of Webberville
Community High School graduates
currently enrolled here at the Univer-
sity is four (Represent: Mike, Hannah
and Jeanne). And I'm sure they've had
some of the same experiences dealing
with you fancy city-folk that I have.
I've lived in Ann Arbor for three years
and learned to navigate the things that
made me uncomfortable at first. But
my initial transition to Ann Arbor's
metropolitan, artsy and very liberal
atmosphere was as jarring as putting
Julie Andrews in a KISS video.
My first introduction to the new
environment came on move-in day in
the fall of 2007 at Mary Markley Hall.
Or, more accurately, it came when I was
introduced to my roommate, who was
about as different from me as possible.
Caitlin was easily 5'7", as blonde as can
be and easily beautiful. She looked like
she belonged on "American's Next Top
Model." Caitlinwas from well-to-do St.
Clair Shores, Michigan, was a liberal
and was the most cosmopolitan person
I had ever met. She had pink and lime
green bedding, a whole bin full of high
heels, and she promptly rushed a soror-
ity. I was intimidated.
We passed most of the year in
silence. Don't get me wrong. She was
a friendly person, and we got along
quite well for two people who didn't

share any interests. We just didn't
have any common ground to start on,
and so conversations were hard. Not
having anything to say to someone -
especially someone with whom I lived
- was bizarre.
Just a small town
girl, livin' in a big
university world.

The program, called The W.K. Kellogg
Foundation Woodrow Wilson Michigan
Teaching Fellowship, is expected to be a
competitive program that will accept 240
students from the six participating univer-
sities in Michigan, according to an article
in the Daily on Friday. The fellowship took
shape after the W.K. Kellogg Foundation
awarded $16.7 million to the Woodrow
Wilson National Fellowship Foundation
last November. The program will allow
teachers to receive their master's degrees
in either science, technology, engineering
or mathematics, known as STEM fields.
At the completion of the program, the
new teachers will work for at least three
years in one of five of the state's struggling
school districts, including Detroit, Grand
Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek and Ben-
ton Harbor.
Programs like the teaching fellowship are
a chance for the state to support an educa-
tional system that will revitalize Michigan's
economy. The state's economy is shifting
toward a basis in developing technolo-
gies. But to make this change successful,
Michigan residents will need more edu-
cation opportunities to prepare them for
knowledge-based jobs. Since it is the goal of
Michigan to expand education in the STEM
fields, the fellowship's focus on these aca-
demic areas will improve the quality and
quantity of the type of teachers Michigan
needs. This will compound the benefits of
the new program as a new wave of well-
trained and engaged teachers will inspire
even more students to take up studies in
STEM fields.
The new teaching fellowship is an invest-
ment in education. It provides teachers to

districts which are most desperately in need
of resources. Often, struggling districts can't
obtain the resources they need to improve.
And each time a school fails to make "Ade-
quate Yearly Progress," as defined by the
Bush administration's No Child Left Behind
Act of 2001, it loses more government sup-
port and sinks deeper into the hole. But the
way to improve a school is to give it more
resources, not to punish failure with loss
of income. The fellowship offers a valuable
resource to struggling schools.
At the same time, early placement in
underfunded districts is a valuable learning
experience for teachers who may have never
experienced the more troubling aspects of
the public education system. And educa-
tion of teachers prepares them to tackle the
problems that education faces.
Sending aid to underprivileged school
districts will also help to narrow the
socioeconomic divisions in institutions of
higher education. When students in under-
privileged schools receive insufficient
educations, they are less likely to attend
institutions of higher learning. But col-
lege should be accessible to people from all
backgrounds. Efforts to give schools more
resources - like highly-educated teachers
from successful colleges like the University
- are the only way to help bridge the gaps
between wealthy districts and traditionally
under-performing districts.
Because it is an institution of higher
learning, it's the University's responsibility
to encourage all forms of education. This
fellowship is one way to do that. But the
state can - and should - go further by pro-
tecting education funding and expanding
programs that invest in education.

I also learned pretty quickly that
safety was going to be different from
that back home. I'd gotten the obliga-
tory spiel from the Department of Pub-
lic Safety at Orientation.and I wasn't
stupid. I knew that it was easier to stay
safe in Webberville, which doesn't
reallyhave crime except for afew cases
of superficial vandalism and speed-
ing, than on a campus with 40,000
students. My father took it to the next
level. He armed me with a safety flash-
light (available at Cabela's) and a guilt-
inducing reminder to always carry it
with me because he wanted me to "be
safe, honey, because I love you and I
don't want anything to happen to you."
And they saythat mothers are the mas-
ters of guilt-tripping.
I learned to deal, of course. And
while I still get annoyed by sirens
at night and the light pollution that
obscures the stars, I think I've bal-
anced my down-home desires with
some big-city sensibilities.
But I'm still not such a city-slicker
that I think that virtual orchards are
fun. So stop sending me Farmville
invitations.

PHIL POWER I
Fleming set standard for 'U'

Robben W. Fleming served as the Univer-
sity's president from 1968 to 1979 and again
as interim president in 1988. He was widely
recognized as among the University's wis-
est and most successful presidents, admired
and respected by the University community,
including by those who disagreed with him.
He was a lawyer, an arbitrator and an expert
on labor-management relations. Fleming came
to Ann Arbor following his years as chancel-
lor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
During his time in Madison, he was famous for
bailing out students who had been arrested for
protesting the war. His training and personal-
ity served him well when he was forced to lead
the University through the turbulent times of
the Vietnam War and the peak of student oppo-
sition on campus.
In Ann Arbor, he constantly urged restraint,
reason and thoughtful listening by all sides.
When Washtenaw County Sheriff Doug Har-
vey was anxious to arrest and jail protestors,
Fleming interceded in a way that was both firm
and flexible. He later faced the Black Action
Movement strike of 1970, when groups led by
the Students for a Democratic Society called
for more minority admissions to the University.
The strike eventually resulted in a wide variety
of affirmative action programs in admissions
and increased minority composition on cam-
pus. Throughout this entire period, he avoided
the violent clashes that took place atnother uni-

versities. I believe that his patience, grace and
unpretentiousness elevated him to national
renown without ever turning his head.
His posture during these eruptions was
simple. He believed that it was important to
listen carefully and to make a sharp distinc-
tion between often inflated rhetoric and actu-
al demands. He once said that his experience
taught him not to be particularly disturbed by
what opponents might say to each other (or
to him!) but that consistency and calm could
defuse almost any inflammable situation.
I remember talking with him in 1988, when
I was serving as a regent. Sitting in his office
with his manual typewriter on his desk - he
preferred to write his own statements rather
than dictate them - he said: "The entire histo-
ry of human progress has always been accom-
panied by conflict. It's an ordinary part of
moving things along. You simply have to expect
it." Then he pushed his chair back, chuckled,
threw his hands in the air and said: "So, let's
have some conflict!"
He was a perfect leader for his time. And his
grace, humor and sensible behavior set a stan-
dard for all subsequent University presidents
to follow.
Phil Power was editorial director of The
Michigan Daily in 1960. He has published numerous
community newspapers in Michigan and served
as a egent of the University from 1987 to 1999.

There's no denying that diver-
sity benefits college campuses
and society as a whole. In his
book "The Differ--
ence," University
Prof Scott E. Page
shows that diversi-
ty results in a soci-
ety that is better
at problem solving
and is more pro-
ductive. A diverse
community allows
us to celebrate what TOMMASO
makes us uniqueP
while simultane- PAVONE
ously respecting
our differences.
A plethora of research also shows
that when minority students are
given the necessary tools, they per-
form as well, if not better, than their
white counterparts. In a recent book
titled "The Shape of the River," Wil-
liam Bowen and Derek Bok found that
African-American college graduates
achieve above average civil participa-
tion rates and marriage rates. It follows
that performance isn't a derivative of
identity but rather a product of oppor-
tunity. So why do I find the affirmative
action concept problematic?
Hint: It's not because I am a conser-
vative (I am not).
Many make the mistake of equating
affirmative action with diversity and
conclude that to be against affirmative
action means being against diversity.
But affirmative action is only a means
of achieving the goal of diversity, and
- as is often the case in the policymak-
ing process - it is our dependence on
this method, not its goal, that I contest.
In essence, while affirmative action
may be necessary in the short run, we
should seek to make it unnecessary in
the longrun.
Consider some common - and often
factually fallacious - criticisms of
affirmative action. We have all heard
the argument that affirmative action
constitutes reverse discrimination.
Critics who argue this reduce affir-
mative action to a system of quotas,
which allows minority candidates to

enter into programs at the expense of
their white counterparts. On the flip
side, some, including Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas, have argued
that affirmative action causes minority
students to develop inferiority com-
plexes. While one can question the
validity of these arguments, as I often
do, the result is undeniable - affirma-
tive action remains a divisive and con-
tentious topic.
And, as University students, we find
ourselves at the heart of the storm.
Repeatedly, liberals have had to defend
affirmative action policies. Surely
there's a better long-term means to
promote diversity on college campuses
without facing continuous charges of
sponsoringreverse discrimination.
An alternative solution exists. But
it's not simple, nor is it cheap. It entails
tackling the root problem which affir-
mative action seeks to remedy: the fact
that minority students are often dis-
advantaged compared to their white
counterparts. According to the Kai-
ser Family Foundation's State Health
Facts, approximately one-third of all
African Americans live below the pov-
erty line, compared to only approxi-
mately 12 percent of whites. The
imprisonment rate among young Afri-
can-Americans who drop out of high
school is almost 23 percent, according
to a new report released by a national
coalition sponsored by the Alternative
Schools Network. In short, minority
students find themselves coping with
no after-school programs, rampant
crime, overpopulated schools lacking
in supplies and unstable family nucle-
uses. It's not easy to prioritize getting
into college in such an environment.
Sadly, many policymakers try to
reap support in minority commu-
nities by flashing their affirmative
action credentials. Thereafter, they
never make the effort to solve the
problems necessitating affirmative
action programs in the first place.
This amounts to indirectly support-
ing systematic inequality.
We should stop turning a blind eye
to the racially driven inequality that
exists throughout the United States,

only then to attempt to remedy the
situation through the college admis-
sions process. If we wish to promote
diversity on college campuses the
right way, we should actively support
anti-crime policies in troubled neigh-
borhoods, restructuring inner-city
schools and expanding after-school
and recreational programs. This would
allow minority students to compete4
on a leveled academic playing field,
and affirmative action would become
increasingly obsolete.
The solution to
racial' inequality is 1
inner-city reform.
Such reforms won't be easy. They
require time, solidarity and, even
worse, some charity on the part of
those fortunate enough to reside in
privileged communities. But to suc-
ceed in these policies would mean
providing minority students with the
necessary tools to compete with their
white counterparts. Diversity within
college campuses is sure to result.
What's more, nobody will be able to
accuse liberals of promoting reverse
discrimination.
I don't seek to provide a mind-
blowing solution to systematic racial
inequality. Instead, I wish to high-
light it as the primary problem and
propose a more constructive way
of framing the affirmative action
debate. Noting affirmative action's
problems and recognizing that racial
inequality won't be erased overnight,
we should consider affirmative action
anecessary - buttemporary - means
of ensuring diversity.r t
I, for one, await the day when we
can achieve diversity on campus
without having to tinker with college
admissions.

Duffy's prized poetry
brings in the crowds

Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell stood in for the late Heath Ledger, who passed before the movie was completed.
The Doc.tor isin

Heath Ledger takes a final bow
in 'Imaginarium,' Terry
Gilliam's whimsical new film
By TIMOTHY RABB
Daily Arts Writer
Film critics and movie enthusiasts alike have
long been awestruck when confronted with the
eccentric mind of direc-
tor Terry Gilliam ("12 Mon--
keys"), a Monty Python alum.
His visualizations can only The Imainarium
be characterized as schizo- of Doctor
phrenic, aberrant fascina-
tions that take full advantage Pamassus
of the free range of graphical
capabilities offered by modern At the State
cinema. Gilliam's latest fare, Sony
"The Imaginarium of Doctor
Parnassus," is an epic tale that bears the atypical
themes of his previous works - surrealism, fantasy
and hellish spectacle - while also unintentionally
plunging viewers into new depths of morbidity by
means of Heath Ledger's posthumous appearance.
"Imaginarium" tells the tale of a wizened old man
known as Doctor Parnassus who leads the humble
life of a monk. He finds purpose in the medium of
spiritual storytelling, a process he and his follow-
ers consider essential in facilitating earthly order.
Desiring more time to tell these stories, Parnassus
(Christopher Plummer, "Up") makes a Faustian bar-
gain with the classiest Satan (Tom Waits, "Coffee
and Cigarettes") since Meryl Streep in "The Devil
Wears Prada." Upon winning his mysterious wager,
Parnassus earns eternal life.
Unfortunately, he underestimates the frivolity of
humankind, and his stories soon become trivial in
an increasingly fast-moving world. Seeing Parnas-
sus's despaired condition, the devil exploits him
with another, more sinister wager: The vitality of
youth and the woman of his desires will be given to

him, so long as he relinquishes his firstborn child
when he or she reaches the age of 16. Years later, as
Parnassus's daughter approaches her 16th birthday,
the Doctor realizes he must satisfy the terms of a
final diabolical wager to save his daughter's immor-
tal soul.
Though viewers have come to expect the ominous
in Gilliam's films, there's not enough set-up in "Par-
nassus" for what must be one of the most haunting
scenes in recent film history. We are first introduced
to Heath Ledger's character Tony as he hangs by
a noose under a bridge, his lifeless expression and
deathly pallor accentuated by intermittent flashes of
lightning. Though we later find Tony alive and well
due to an ingenious method of sustenance, nothing
can remove the grotesque premonition of a dead
Heath Ledger from the minds of the audience.
Tony joins Parnassus as a makeshift marketing
representative, convincing the careless, materialis-
tic inhabitants of our modern world to embrace the
anachronistic moving stage upon which the Doc-
tor performs his masterwork. Parnassus's imagi-
narium, which exists behind an enigmatic onstage
mirror, is akin to the musings of Salvador Dali; it's
a landscape in which ladders extend to the strato-
sphere, giant lily pads bridge an endless oceanic
expanse and winding rivers form a purgatorial rift
between the hellish and the heavenly.
Bizarrely detached as this fantasy world maysound,
one of the film's biggest shortcomings is the unjusti-
fiably short time it spends exploring the facets of the
imaginarium. The immersive atmosphere behind the
mirror is every bit as captivating as "Avatar," but with-
out necessitating any hipster Real-3D glasses.
Gilliam managed to resourcefully combine the
shots of the late Ledger with the contributions of
Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell in a sur-
prisingly seamless manner that may earn "Imagi-
narium" a rightful designation as the director's
magnum opus. Unlike the oft-undeserved attention
many talentless artists earn posthumously, Heath
Ledger's final performance proves he left us at the
acme of his acting career, and it serves to remind us
all'of just how much we sorely miss him.

enough to hear the poetry recita-

"I'll be talking about the stories

As Great Britain's Poet Laure-

poetry. To her, the honor is more of
a reflection on her country, not the
individual poet who receives it.
"Poet Laureate simply means to
me that a country values its poets
and that one poet is the repre-

Converted from the older stan-

"It's given by the Sherry Insti-
tute in Spain. So, I will be getting
700 bottles of sherry, but over ten

When asked if she had already
taken the opportunity to taste her
gift, Duffy responded in the affir-
mative.
"I've tasted lots of it I get
a different type every year,"
Duffy added. "So I'm going to go

Vampire weakened

By JOSHUA BAYER
DailyArts Writer
You know what kind of movie
you're watching when some ran-
dom dude with
a shiny bald
head appears
onscreen for a Daybrekers
second - just
minding his own At Quality16
beeswax - and and Showcase
the first thought Lionsgate
that comes to
mind is, "He's
probably going to be impaled."
You really know what kind of
movie you're watching when said
baldy is skewered with an anony-
mous dart about two seconds
later.
"Daybreakers" is "that kind
of movie" - but it probably
shouldn't have been. Starting off
as more of a dystopian think piece
than a kerosene-soaked gore-fest,
the film is especially disappoint-
ing because of its squandered
premise. The opening 15 minutes
violently dump the viewer into
a vivid parallel universe where
over 90 percent of the human
race has been turned into blood-
thirsty vampires, making humans
a sought-after endangered species
and their blood a rapidly dwin-
dling commodity.
The stark world that the Spier-
ig brothers ("Undead") create
makes for some genuinely affect-
ing, socially conscious eye candy.
"Daybreakers" drives a stake into
the heart of the sensational, "I
vant to suck your blood" vam-
pire archetype, opting instead
to portray vamps as mundanely
human-like - albeit with pastier
skin and significantly sharper
teeth. There's something incred-
ibly unsettling alout watching

Investigation into incident
at Chi Psi house dropped

AAPD: Sexual
assault case closed
at victim's request
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily StaffReporter
The investigation of the sexual
assault of an 18 year old girl at a Chi
Psi fraternity party in November
has been closed, according to the
Ann Arbor police.
AAPD Lt. Angella Abrams told
the Daily yesterday that the case

contract that requires them to
return the book by the last Fri-
day during finals. Students must
also provide a credit card, which
would be charged for the price of
the book plus a 10-percent process-
ing fee in case the rented book isn't
returned.
Riedman said she hopes the
program will help the bookstores
effectively compete with Chegg.
"We've started to see more
competition in that area," she said.
"We knew that rentals were an
area that we needed to explore as
well."
While the rental program is new
this semester, Riedman said "it's
been hugely successful."
Riedman said the Nebraska
Book Company is committed to
continuing the program in upcom-
ing semesters.

weekly.
"My idea when it comes to
cannabis is to bring it to a level
that any other industry is, and in
this case it's a multi-billion dol-
lar industry that just needs to be
legitimized," Freed said. "Within
that industry I do believe is the
salvation of the state of Michi-
gan."
Freed said Michigan is the
perfect setting for this industry
to flourish because of its envi-
ronmental landscape and soaring
unemployment.
"Michigan, more so than Cali-
fornia or Oregon, has this ability
because we have the farmland,
we have the unemployed people,
we have these empty factories,"
he said. "Everything's already
here and most of this is green
industry and a lot of it can be gov-
ernment funded."
But James McCurtis, public
information officer for the Mich-
igan Department of Community
Health, said because caregivers
are limited by state regulations
to growing a certain amount of
the plant, the idea that medical
marijuana industries could solve
the economic woes of the state is
unrealistic.
"Honestly, I don't think it
could fix Michigan's economy,"
he said. "The way the law's writ-

insurance manager at UHS said.
"Student insurance people are
sort of on hold in essence to what
the government's plans are going
to do and how it's going to affect
it," Klever said.
Anticipating several different
outcomes, Klever said her office is
"keeping an open mind" but is not
doing anything differently during
this year's negotiations.
The uncertain nature of the
bill leaves many unknowns for
student insurance plans in the
2010-2011 school year, potential-
ly making current negotiations
obsolete.
"This insurance has to be effec-
tive for fall 2010 and I have to have
alternatives available for the stu-

request."
AAPD Lt. Dave Monroe told The
Michigan Daily at the time of the
incidentthatpolicerespondedearly
on Nov. 22, 2009 to a call reporting
sexual assault at the South State
Street fraternity house.
Monroe said at the time that
both the victim and the sus-
pect were 18 years old and knew
each other before the incident
occurred.
Michael Taub, president of Chi
Psi, told the Daily at the time that
the suspect was not a member of .
"I think in the future what's
important is to give students a
choice so that if they want to buy
the textbook new or used they can,
or if they want to rent they can,"
Riedman said.

gram are largely positive, though it
remains to be seen if the program
will catch on and compete with the
various other options, including
online retailers, traditional meth-
ods of purchasing books and buy-
ing from friends.
Engineering freshman Matt
DiTullio said he didn't know
whether students would begin
renting books more often than
buying them.
"I think that students who buy
from a bookstore will use books,
but I think that a lot of students
prefer buying books cheaper from
friends," he said.
Though DiTullio didn't buy any
books from Ulrich's this semester,
he said he would be willing to give
the new program a try.

"The person that this affects is
a person who is not affiliated at all
with the fraternity," Taub said in
a Nov. 23 Daily article. "He was
not a guest at the event nor was
he at all affiliated as a brother or
pledge."
AnnArbor.com reported yester-
day that the suspect is a Michigan
Football player, who was arrested
the morning of the reported sexual
assault.
The football player remains on
the team, according to AnnArbor.

LSA sophomore Ben Sackett said
he wouldn't rent books because he
doesn't think it would save him
any money.
"Generally, I found that it's not
really that much of a better deal,"
Sackett said.
While he said he wouldn't use
the program, he thought it would
catch on with a majority of stu-
dents.
Engineering sophomore Mal-
colm Hegeman is aware of the
new program, but said he will
most likely only rent books for
classes that don't pertain to his
major.
"If it's a class that isn't really
important to me or to my field of
study or major, then I would be
more likely to rent a textbook," he
said.
Hegeman added that he thought
the new service will be competi-
tive with websites like Chegg.com.
"I could see the program here
on campus being just as success-
ful," he said.

ten, people aren't compensated
for providing marijuana or any-
thing like that. (Caregivers) are
reimbursed," McCurtis said. "It's
not anything where they can
make a profit from it, they can't
open up a medical marijuana
store...medical marijuana is not
the answer for the economy."
But officials at the Med Grow
Cannibis College, in Southfield,
Mich. disagree.
The school - founded last May
by 24-year-old Nick Tennant
- has about 80 to 120 students
enrolled each month and a cur-
riculum with classes on cannabis
horticulture, legal issues, history,
cooking, advocacy and politics,
according to Tennant.
Perry Belcher, a professor at
the college, teaches the history of
cannabis from 6000 B.C. through
modern day, which analyzes the
various perspectives of marijua-
na throughout time and the pro-
paganda that has contributed to
its negative stigma.
Belcher said the medical mari-
juana industry has the prospect
to offer vast job opportunities
for the unemployed in the state,
especially for those interested in
becoming caregivers.
Because Michigan's medical
marijuana law limits patients and
caregivers to grow the plant, as
opposed to purchasing it at a dis-
pensary - as is the case in other
states like California - Belcher
said most of the jobs that are
dents, and so I can't put things on
hold for what might be," Klever
said.
She said her office's current
strategy is to establish a plan that's
"flexible" so that it could be re-
adjusted easily to fit any changes
that may come in the upcoming
months with the national health
care legislation.
It is still unknown what, if any,
components of student insurance
policies will change, or if existing
plans will be replaced completely
by a public option.
Despite the uncertainty of next
year's insurance plan, Klever said
Michigan Blue Cross Blue Shield
entered into the bidding for the
first time this year. Continued
corporate interest demonstrates
that private insurance compa-
nies - many of which are directly
involved in the creation of the bill
- are not concerned that the leg-

becoming available because of
the legalization of medical mari-
juana in the state are in the hor-
ticultural sector.
"It's incredible to watch actu-
al farming come back into style
and become a powerful occu-
pation for somebody," Belcher
said. "These are really jobs that
are happening and income that's
being made and it's all by the
people for the people. What I'm
seeing is great success, not just
for the college but for the state
of Michigan."
Chris Chiles, an LSAsenior and
founder of the University's chap-
ter of Students for Sensible Drug
Policy, said he thinks the indus-
try could greatly help Michigan's
economic situation.
"I think people will very soon
realize the benefits of the emerg-
ing medical marijuana industry
because more revenue will stay
in-state instead of being fun-
neled away to illegal markets,"
Chiles said.
The medical marijuana eco-
nomic sector also provides
entrepreneurial opportunities
for people out of work or recent
graduates looking for employ-
ment, Chiles said.
"It's creating more revenue
and giving people the knowledge
to create their own businesses
and become entrepreneurs in
this industry," he said. "Soin this
respect, I think it's nice to see
that open up."
islation will affect their student
plans with universities adversely,
she said.
Students covered under the Uni-
versity's current student insurance
plan receive the same University
Health Service benefits that stu-
dents under their parents' insur-
ance have, in addition to coverage
under the nationwide Aetna net-
work. The policy covers doctor
and specialist visits and medical
testing procedures, among other
services-.
"It's a very good policy, it's a
very rich policy," said Klever.
Other unique benefits of the
plan are that it doesn't require pol-
icyholders to be full-time students
and it offers inclusive coverage for
students' spouses, according to
Klever. ,
"We don't exclude anyone who
is working towards their degree, "
she said.

narcotics, human trafficking and
other forms of lawlessness over

He added that the FBI and the
Russia Federal Security Service
have already begun collaborating
to specifically fight international
cybercrime.
Though Beyrle admitted that
many U.S. presidents have made
similar promises to improve
U.S. relations with Russia with
little success, he said the Obama
administration is taking a differ-
ent approach.
At a July 2009 summit, President
Barack Obama and Russian Presi-
dent Dmitry Medvedev agreed to
form a bilateral commission, which
wouldfocusonanexchangeof ideas
between the two countries.
"It was agreed there would be

tence after making a deal with
Prosecutor Karen Field.
tn preliminary court proceed-
ings, Field dropped the additional
charge of arson of personal proper-
ty for both defendants, stating that
the arson of a vacant building fell
more accurately under real prop-
erty. The dismissal of the personal
property charge removed 10 years
from Arens's maximum sentence.
Arens faced problems earlier in
court proceedings when a request
to lower his $100,000 bond was
denied in his preliminary exami-
nation by Judge J. Simpson, who
cited his previous criminal record.
Inthe past,Arens was convicted
about 16 working groups under
this presidential commission,
focusing not only on nuclear secu-
rity or health, but also issues like
space, cultural exchanges, sports
and a whole range of issues to
build a structure of interaction
below the level of presidents,"
Beyrle said.
He said though presidents of
the U.S. and Russia have had good
relationships in the past, it is vital
to take steps to unite the constitte-
ents of the respective nations.
The ambassador said Russia
experiencedgreatchange inthelast
few years, edging closer to democ-
racy and to a healthier relationship
with America. He said Russian citi-
zens are traveling across national
borders more than ever and have
uncensored Internet access, despite
previous restrictions.
"Russia has never been more
open to the outside world, and the
Russian people have never been
more free to express their opin-
ions," Beyrle said.
But he said the state of human

of home invasion and retail fraud.
With such a history, Judge Simp-
son said Arens's release would be
"detrimental to the safety of the
community."
Arens remains in custody and
will stand before Judge Morris
again for sentencing on Feb. 22.
Mackenzie, 18, stood in front
of Judge Morris on Jan. 4 for his
pretrial conference, which was
adjourned until Jan. 25.
At the time of the adjourn-
ment, the court was made aware
that Mackenzie intended to sub-
mit a written request to post the
$50,000 bond and be released
from custody.
rights in Russia remains a problem
and added that organized political
activity and television broadcasts
are still closely controlled.
In his closing remarks, the
ambassador said the United States
has a responsibility to help Russia
reach its democratic potential.
"Our national interest demands
that we maintain a productive,
constructive relationship with
this country to ensure that her
transition to a prosperous democ-
racy - the democracy that my
Russian friends in Moscow tell me
that they deserve after all they've
been through in the last 20 years
- happens sooner rather than
later," he said.
Joanna Steele, a graduate stu-
dent in the School of Information,
said she felt encouraged by the
ambassador's speech.
"I attended a talk at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow in 2006 and
was very disappointed by the atti-
tude of the embassy at that time,"
Steele said. "After hearing the
ambassador today, I'm hopeful."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

What is wrong with Michigan basketball?

On Monday, I wrote a column
addressing the Michigan
basketball team's need to
focus on what it is about the team
that causes it to
shoot itself in
the foot.
I said tack-
ling those
internal strug-
gles should be
the Wolverines'
main focus JOE
right now.
In response, STAPLETON
I received
plenty of comments on the article
asking the same relevant, obvious
question: so what are these internal
struggles?
It's a good question, and one
that's extremely tough to answer.
But let me outline for you what I
think the problems are, and what I
think the problems aren't.
Defensefrom offense
This is a generalization, but
really good teams - teams that go
to the NCAA Tournament - create
offense from their defense.
If shots aren't falling, good teams
buckle down on defense and create
fastbreak opportunities and easy
buckets through steals, blocks, or
long rebounds.
Why do great teams operate this
way?
You can't have an off day on
defense - you're either trying or
you're not, and that holds true with
the even talent level in the Big Ten.
Even if you're shooting poorly, you
can rely on your defense to create
layups.
Yeah, I know, sounds like some-
thing you heard from your 4th-
grade YMCAbasketball coach, but
it's true.,
Unfortunately, the Wolverines
appear to be working on the oppo-
site premise-their at times lacka-
daisical defense seems to stem from
missingshots.
When their offense isn't work-
ing, their defense breaks down.
This was painfully apparent against
Northwestern on Sunday. As Michi-
gan began to have serious trouble
cracking the Northwestern zone
in the second half, the team's frus-
tration showed on the other end.
In the first half, the Wolverines

allowed the Wildcats to shoot just
34 percent from the field.
The second half? 56 percent.
"Because (Northwestern's zone)
took us out of rhythm (on offense),
our defense in the second half was
not good," Michigan coach John
Beilein said after the game. "We
just got distracted by our lack of
offense, and that's the story of this
team."
So, there's the major problem
with the defense. But if the defense
is lacking when the offense slips
up, why has the offense been strug-
gling so much this season? If the
Wolverines could find consistency
on offense, they presumably would
play much harder on defense and
they'd be a pretty good team -'
maybe the team people expected to
see at the beginning of the season.
The pointguards
I'm pretty sure you know who
I'm talking about, but I'll say it
anyway. The freshman, Darius
Morris and the shooting guard,
sophomore Stu Douglass.
Morris was declared the starter
at the beginning of the season
because of the promise he showed
in high school. He's quick, has great
vision, can penetrate and can dish.
But he's still a freshman, and we
can't all be John Wall.
He has shown flashes of bril-
liance, and fans can see him devel-
op every game, but he's not quite
ready to lead a college team at that
spot yet. I'm confident he will be
capable, just not yet.
So instead of Morris, Beilein
went with his next-best, and safer,
option - Douglass.
Douglass handled the transition
from shooting guard very well, cut-
ting down drastically on his turn-
overs during the season, improving
his defense and providing the Wol-
verines with a steady, experienced
hand on offense.
Unfortunately, Douglass is not
a point guard - he doesn't slash
and he doesn't drive-and-dish. He's
simply a shooting guard who was
'asked to play point guard.
The result? Michigan is still
without an experienced point
guard.
How important is having an
experienced point guard? Ask
almost any recent NCAA Tourna-

ment Champion: 2009 North Caro-
lina - Ty Lawson, junior; 2008
Kansas - Mario Chalmers, junior;
2006 and 2007 Florida - Taurean
Green, sophomore and junior; 2005
North Carolina - Raymond Felton,
junior.
The position is a lot like quarter-
back in football, and Michigan fans
know all too well what it's like play-
ing with a freshman quarterback.
Starting an inexperienced point
guard leads to two intertwined
issues: not only is there no one who
can get the ball in to DeShawn Sims
in a way that puts him in a posi-
tion to score, but there is also no
one who can penetrate, draw the
defense and kick out for wide-open
shots. Good entry passes are abso-
lutely essential to a player like Sims,
who goes one-on-one in the post
with bigger players most nights.
And when there's no point guard
who can penetrate and draw the
defense away from the shooters,
the Wolverines end up taking more
contested shots, which leads nicely
to my next point...
3-point shooting
To be fair, Michigan's shooting
has improved lately, but the team
is still shooting a mediocre 29 per-
cent for the season. The shooting
woes on this team have been so
widespread that I'm going to tackle
the worst offenders on the team
player-by-player. For the sake of
brevity, I'm making a SO-shots-or-
more rule.
Stu Douglass (32 percent from
3-point line, 33 percent from the
field) - Here's my argument, with
little statistical or anecdotal back-
up: playing point guard threw off
Douglass's shot. As a spot-up shoot-
ing guard, it's critical to develop
a catch-and-shoot rhythm during
games. It's a mentality more than
anything - "IfI get the ball and
I'm open, I'm shooting it." Douglass
being forced into a playmaking role,
one that doesn't suit him switched
his mentality from shooter to dis-
tributor, and all of a sudden, he
started missing open shots. He just
stopped looking comfortable.
Manny Harris (28 percent, 46
percent) - Hamstring. Hamstring,
hamstring, hamstring. I know it
sounds like a convenient excuse,
but it's much more than that. Imag-

ine going up for a jumpshot, except
when you jump, you can only jump
off of one leg. You think that would
throw you off a little bit? That's
what Harris has had to deal with,
especially at the beginning of the
season. And while it is healing, he's
still dealing with it now. Now, you
may be thinking, "But Joe, that's
not really Manny's game. He's a
slasher, right?" You're right, per-
son I just made up, but consider
this: When Harris has the ball,
defenders usually have to think
about three things -1) is he going
to shoot? 2) is he going to drive? 3)
dang it. When Harris can't hit his
shots, all defenders have to think
about is his ability to drive, which
allows them to play off him, making
him easier to guard.
Laval Lucas-Perry (35 percent,
39 percent) - Tough to criticize,
since he's been the team's best
shooter, but at the same time he did
barely cracked the 50-shotbarrier
with 54. And while Lucas-Perry
started the season strong, notching
18 points in Michigan's first game
of the Old Spice Classic against
Creighton, his shooting has disap-
peared in some important games.
Utah - zero points, 0-1.
Kansas - two points, 0-2.
Indiana - zero points, 0-2.
Of course, against Penn State he
had 16 points and led an improb-
able comeback effort. Lucas-Perry's
problem is consistency, and, as
weird as it sounds, his problem is
not shooting enough. Take another
look at those stats - lots of 0-i's and
0-2's up there. Generally, when he
shoots more, he makes more. His
best games?
Creighton -18 points, 4-6.
Penn State - 16 points, 4-8.
More shots seem to lead to more
makes. Lucas-Perry needs to adopt
more of a shooter's mentality. The
only way to make shots is to take
them, so when the redshirt sopho-
more catches the ball at the 3-point
line, just fire away. That way, he
gives himself a chance to develop
an in-game rhythm. Lucas-Perry is
simply not aggressive enough, and
the numbers show that when he
asserts himself, he makes shots.
Zack Novak (28 percent, 38
percent) - OK. Him I'm having
trouble with. Last year, Novak shot
34 percent. This year, he's tied with

Harris for last in this group. And
I'm just as stumped as he is. He
does have an unorthodox shooting
motion, one that leaves him fad-
ing away almost every time, but
he doesn't need to change up his
form justbecause he's having a bad
year-it's obviously worked for him
in the past, it will work for him
again. Fortunately, my inability to
make sense of Novak's poor shoot-
ing leads us to my next point.
While Michigan is shooting the
ball very poorly frombeyond the
arc this year, they didn't exactly
shoot the lights out last year. Thir-
ty-three percent? Not great.
The bigger difference is that last
year, the Wolverines made shots
when they absolutely needed them.
Remember Douglass's two huge
triples against UCLA? Or the four
from Novak againstDuke? While
Michigan didn't light the world on

fire frombeyond the arc, they made
them when they needed to. For
some reason, that's not happening
this year.
No, it doesn't appear to me that
there is any sort of internal conflict
on this team. It's not like I hang out
with these guys every day, but I do
have more access than most, and
this does seems like a group of guys
that like each other. After games,
nobody complains about touches,
the play of their teammates, the
coaches or anything like that.
These guys seem to havebought
into Beilein's philosophy, and
they're just as confused as the fans
are about what has happened s6 far
this season. The really unfortunate
part of all this is that while I believe
this outline pretty clearly explains
the troubles Michigan is experienc-
ing this year, time may have already
run out.

Don't count Blue out

The Michigan hockey team
couldn't have been too
excited when coach Red
Berenson had
his players
to gather at TIM
the south end ROHAN
of the rink
towards the On Ice Hockey
end of Tues-
day's practice.
They knew what was coming.
Berenson held a stopwatch and
made sure that when each group
of players approached the red line,
they understood their goal. The
Wolverines started the workout
rigorously - they had to skate
down and back twice in the time
designated by Berenson - but
exhaustion soon set in.
Players bent over to regain their
breath. And sophomore David
Wohlberg, who missed last Fri-
day's game due to illness, had to
stop and skate to the bench. A trash
can stood in front of him.
When Wolverines began to pour
off the ice, team trainer Rick Ban-
croft stopped Wohlberg to remind
him that he still had to do the last
interval he had missed.
Without hesitation, the sopho-
more forward turned around and
skated the rounds he still owed
Berenson.
Wohlberg and his teammates
know that it's gut-check time for
the Wolverines.
Don't give up on this team just
yet. Michigan (7-7 CCHA, 12-10
overall) still has a chance to turn
its season from ordinary to NCAA
tournament-bound, and it starts
this weekend against Alaska.
In the past four years, four
CCHA teams have made the
16-team tournament each season,
and Berenson has repeatedly made
it clear that one of the team's goals

is to finish the season in the top
four of the conference. But there
isn't much room left for error.
Michigan faced a similar situ-
ation a year ago when it was 14-6
after the Great Lakes Invitational
in December 2008. Granted, the
Wolverines had four more wins,
but they dominated the second half
of the season and lost only three
games the rest of the year.
"They were expecting alot of
things from us (last year)," senior
captain Chris Summers said. "We
expect a lot of things from our-
selves as well. Just fine tuning
things and having the right atti-
tude I think is the most important
thing."
Michigan is taking the right
approach to the uphill climb they
face in the last 15 games of the
season - treating each game as if
it's the most important one of the
season. And it's easy to talk the
talk, but now Michigan has three
season-defining chances to walk
the walk.
Currently, the Wolverines are
smack dab in the middle of a tight
CCHA race, in a three-way tie for
seventh place in the conference
with Nebraska-Omaha and Notre
Dame. But Michigan faces a slew of
conference contenders in the next
three weekends: No. 1(tied) Ferris
State, No. 3 Michigan State and
No. 4 Alaska.
The Wolverines have backed
themselves into acorner due to
early-season splits with Ohio
State and Bowling Green. And
getting swept by Michigan State
and Miami (Ohio) sure didn't help.
Now, Michigan cannot afford to
get fewer than four or five wins in
these upcoming six games.
A 23-14 record is within the
Wolverines' reach and would put
them on par with those teams from

the CCHA that have made the
NCAA tournament in recent years.
But that would mean Michigan
could only lose four games the rest
of the season.
The 2009-10 Wolverines haven't
had a winning streak longer than
three games, though. And Michi-
gan hasn't shown that it can per-
form against the conference's best.
Those skeptical of a bigturnaround
have all the evidence they need.
The Wolverines have also been
inconsistent in all phases of five-
on-five hockey this season.
Still, all it takes is one solid
weekend, one sweep - or maybe
three - to turn around a season. It
is still possible.
A top-four finish in the confer-
ence would also give the Wolver-
ines a first-round bye in the CCHA
tournament. The momentum of
a second-half surge could push
Michigan to win the Mason Cup
and an automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament. Now, all the Wolver-
ines have to do is win 11 of their
last 15 games.
Berenson said his freshmen
have grown up and his seniors are
realizing their time is running out.
Like last year, the team is starting
to get it.
And the CCHA is strong enough
this year that Berensonbelieves up
to five teams from the conference
could make the NCAA tournament
"If you finish in the top four at
least you're putting yourself ina
position to do well in the playoffs,
Joe Louis, and then see what hap-
pens," Berenson said. "Because
how we do from here until the end,
every game is just as important."
Crazier things have happened.
With Berenson in charge, we do
know that no one will cut any
corners - or miss a sprint for that
matter.

PERSONALSTATEMENT

TSK, TSK, TSA
B R S
BY REBECCA SOLOMON

consider myself an expert traveler at
this point in my life. After four years
and countless flights commuting
between Philadelphia and Ann Arbor,
I've mastered the art of packing and
I can put my shoes on and my laptop
back in its case in record time.
As winter break ended last week, I
decided that despite my unshakable
skills as alonectraveler I'd still get to the
airport a little earlier, conscious of the
inevitable repercussions in the wake of
the failed Christmas-day bombing.
Check-in went off without a hitch,
vnd once I reached the front of the
security line, I was ready for my usual
routine. I took off my coat and sweat-
shirt and put my scarf and shoes in the
bins. I took out my laptop, placing it in
a separate container, and sent it down
on the conveyer belt.
I was the epitome of compliance and
wentcthroughthe detector without any
roblems. But as I reached to reclaim
my bag, a TSA officer stopped me and
wouldn't return my things.

sorority as a whole would not be
okay with it.
This groupthink mentality is some-
thing that Javier said he thinks still
holds true within the Greek-letter
community today.
"I would imagine that people in fra-
ternities and sororities feel that they
todividually would be really affirm-
ing or supportive of an LGBT friend
or person, but as they got further out
from themselves, so perhaps a small
group or their chapter, or the Greek
system in general, they might feel like
it's less affirming," Javier said. "That
tends to happen in groups, so the goal
is to help us think about if everyone
hinks they're cool with it but they
also think their peers are not, then
someone has to do something.
"Whose job is it if we all say we
believe something but we don't think
the person next to us believes that?"
Ari Parritz, last year's IFC presi-
dent, said he thinks the results of the
LGBT climate survey still hold true,
despitegreatersignsofnationalaccep-
tance of LGBT individuals like the
introduction and passage of same-sex
marriage legislation in some states.

He informed me that that if I
answered him truthfully, I'd be fine.
Just be honest, he said. I panicked. Had
I accidentally packed shampoo in my
carry on? Did I keep my Swiss Army
knife on my keys? I had been so careful
when packing that I couldn't imagine
what I could have done wrong.
Then he reached into my computer
case and pulled out a small baggie of
white powder. Before I continue, I'd
like to review my thought process as
he said the words "where did you get
this from?"
My first thought: I left my bag on
the floor when I was reaching for my
license to show the attendant. A terror-
ist slipped bomb-detonating powder
into my bag. The terrorist wants me
to get through security and then once
I'm airborne, he'll find me, reclaim the
substance and blow up the plane. I'm
going to be responsible for a terrorist
attack.
My second thought: This is a bag of
drugs. I have just been made part of a
"There's been gay marriage propos-
als in a variety of states since that sur-
vey, so I think maybe that influences
peoples' perceptions of how they
interact with the LGBT community,
but I don't know how much or if it
has at all," Parritz said. "I don't think
much has changed on campus."
But current IFC President Mike
Friedman said he thinks the Greek
system's view toward LGBT individu-
als is, for the most part, accepting, and
that the community's attitude toward
LGBT individuals runs contrary to
the groupthink mentality found in the
2007 survey.
"Under no circumstances would
it be acceptable for people to speak
out against that specific community,"
Friedman said. "And in fact you would
be looked down upon if you did so. So I
think as accepting as people are indi-
vidually, as strongly as people hold
their beliefs on an individual level, that
is translated to the beliefs and accep-
tance of the organization asa whole."
Parritz said that when he was IFC
president, the biggest challenge his
executive board faced while trying
to address LGBT issues within the
Greek system was garnering the sup-
port of individual chapter presidents

other TSA employees because his job
was to train the staff to detect bombs
and other contraband. Here was a man
at the forefront of our fight against
terror, making a joke about one of the
most serious issues facing our country
right now.
And that was it. I got on my flight
and landed safely in Ann Arbor.
Sure, the airline was apologetic, but
instant action wasn't taken. Two days
later I received a call from the airport
- only after I had first called them -
informing me that disciplinary action
had been taken.
As passengers and patrons of air-
ports, we have a lot of responsibility
to comply with airline security. Our
safety depends directly onhow well we
follow the rules. This same standard
needs to be applied to the staff.
Cooperation is necessary for suc-
cessful system operation, especially on
a scale as large as an airport. In order
to cooperate with airlines, I want to
believe that they will show me the
same respect I show them as I comply
with their rules and regulations.
One man's actions aren't enough to
tarnish the reputations of the many
hardworking airline personnel, but it
does open my eyes to how small mis-
takes can have big consequences.

who are willing to push the surge to
work on it and who want to partici-
pate in the programming, want to
keep doing what we're doing. I think
that for any issue you're going to have
to work harder because I think people
may support something but not neces-
sarily want to act on it."
Ohlinger also said that something
more than just ally training needs to
take place to further the conversation
on the issue, and said he thinks the
most effective approach to creating
LGBT awareness in the Greek sys-
tem is not through formal training or
ally workshops, Instead, it is through
LGBT-identified peoples' coming out
to their brothers."
Ohlinger recalled what an older
brother said to him: " 'They don't
know anything. A gay guy might as
well be an alien. But they meet you
and they see you're cool, like all of a
sudden being gay isn't some weird
thing, some strange alien, not some
crazy thing they've just hear about,"
Ohlinger said. "(It's) like, oh, yeah,
that's JD, he's our friend, it doesn't
matter.'"

and general members.
Though members of the execu-
tive boards of IFC and the Panhel-
lenic Association, an organization
comprised of lb sororities on campus,
attended the ally training workshops
last year, Parritz said no non IFC or
Panhel executive board chapter presi-
dents showed any interest in attend-
ing the training.
The Lambda Alliance, too, faces its
own challenges, Javier said, because
people who join or show an interest in
the group may face questioning about
why they care about LGBT issues.
"One of the reasons straight-iden-
tified men don't identify as allies is
because they don't want to be mistak-
e, quote unquote mistaken, as gay,"
Javier said. "They don't want to be
perceived as gay, so that's a road block
to someone who actually does care
about LGBT people."
Even with the formation of the
Lambda Alliance in 2007, there still
remains a lacking voice of out-LGBT
students in the Greek system. The fact
that there are still LGBT-identified
students who don't feel comfortable
comingoutto their fraternitybrothers
is an indicator that something more
needs to be done than programming

like ally training. Because despite get-
ting some people involved, education-
al workshops such as those tend to be
insular events that only involve a very
small percentage of Greek community
members.
While the Lambda Alliance and
workshops are valuable tools, Javier
said, the best approach to further-
ing the awareness and acceptance of
LGBT students in the Greek system is
for people to come out as allies. Javi-
er said people need to demonstrate
openness and tolerance of LGBT indi-
viduals instead of just sitting back and
being apathetic on the issue.
"If people in the Greek community
feel like allies... (for) whatever reason;
whether they have a best friend, broth-
er, sister, cousin, uncle, aunt, parent,
whatever reason - to think about that
reason, reflect on that reason and then
come out, come out as an ally."
Claire Sabourin, the current presi-
dent of the Lambda Alliance agreed,
saying that, in her experience, apathy
was the greatest roadblock to improv-
ing the anti-LGBT perception.
"I think it's more of an apathy,"
Sabourin said. "Not about this partic-
ular issue, but about a lot of things in
general. ButI have met a lot of people

random student interview

ello
Hi. Is Jillian there?
No. Who's this?
Uh ... who's this?
This is her roommate, Sara. Who's this?
Trevor Calero. I'm the magazine editor
at The Michigan Daily.
Oh, OK. No. I'm her roommate.
I don't know if you read the Daily last
week but we're doing this thing called
Random Student Interview. And Iran-
domly chose your roommate, Jillian,
from the student directory. But if you
wouldn't mind doing the interview,
that'd be fine too.
What do I have to do?
Really just talk to me for a couple min-
utes.
Oh, OK.
Have you ever been to Studio 4?
I went there for the first time this week-
end. It was my friend's birthday so we
went out with her. It was OK.
Just OK?
Yeah, I don't know. If I never go back to
that place again I'd be OK.
Why's that?
it wasn't quite what I expected. It was

really just a lot of freshman, a lot of the
same type of people.
I know what you mean though. I used
to go to Studio a lot during my fresh-
man year. It's always one of those, it's
Thursday night, you're in the dorms,
you really don't want to but the kid
down the hall convinces you to go
and you go because you just know it's
going to be the best night of your life
and if you don't go you'll be missing
out. And just like every weekend its
the biggest dissapointment.
Everyone comes back, like, 'Oh my god,
that was so much fun.' But then you
really ask and they're, like,'that sucked.'
So I just figured I'd give it a chance. But
it's really just a lot of the same people.
Exactly, like when you go its just you
and everyone on your floor from Alice
Lloyd.
Exactly, or everyone in ... I'm in a soror-
ity, so it's all my sorority sisters.
What sorority are you in?
I'm in (sorority name removed).
How's that going for you?
Honestly, part of me regrets going
through with it, that I gave rush a

chance. I almost feel like I was tricked,
'cause everyone is, like, 'just wait until
you get to rush, just wait 'till you get to
initiation, just wait till you get, here.'
It's almost, like, just wait for the next
step. But when you get to that next
step, it's never what you thought it
would be.
Right, yeah.
What was rush like?
The first two days you visit all the hous-
es and it's 15-minute segments that
you're at each house. And you just have
these really fake conversations about,
you know, what dorm you're in, what
classes you're taking. And the next set
is a little bit longer and the conversa-
tions just get more fake.
Why do you keep doing it then?
I have this friend who convinced me
it was going to be a good thing. We're
going to room together next year.
Apparently if you have enough priority
in the house, if you go to enough things,
then we can live in the apartments
across the street from our house. So
we're going to try to get as much prior-
ity as we can sowe can live in the apart-

ments and not in the house.
So you're going to do as many soror-
ity-focused events as you can so you
can leave the sorority?
Yes, exactly.
What kind of things do you have to do?
Like, bea sober monitor at parties.
Do you know how awful that's going to
be? I'm just going to tell you right now,
that's going to be awful. Have you ever
been to a fraternity house not drunk?
No.
It's going to be terrible.
Really?
Yeah,it'sgoingto be bad'cause you're
going to look around at all the ridicu-
lously wasted people and you're going
to think, 'Oh my god, this is me when
I'm drunk.'
If it really sucks the first time maybe I'll
just de-pledge. That's how much I'm
devoted to this.
Next week you're totally going to be
out of this sorority.

POLISCI 489:
Law and Social
Change
With an advisory prerequisite
of "seniors only," it might seem like
securing a spot in PoliSci 489 would
be a relatively easy task considering
you'd only have to beat out a quar-
ter of the undergraduate population
in the rush to register. Think again.
The once-a-week lecture, combined
with Professor Richard Bernstein's
positive reputation and the relevant
subject matter, has once again made
the class one of the hottest commod-
ities of the semester.
After the first class, the waitlist
remained at a solid 50-plus students
for a course held ina lecture hall big
enough to accommodate a cool 300-
something bodies.
The course centers on its so-called
"paradigm," which is to explain how
"the legal process can impact the
political process tobringaboutsocial
change." Through guest speakers
such as attorneys, plaintiffs and pub-
lic officials, students will come to
comprehend court rulings that have
brought about monumental change
in law, politics and society.
Kasey King, an LSA senior who
took the course during fall 2009,
cited the variety of topics as the
course's major draw.
"It's something different every
week," he said. "So that's pretty

CICS 101: AMCULT 208:
Intro to Beatniks, Hippies
International Studies and Punks

If you're one of the many students
who's lobbied the University for an
international studies major, congrat-
ulations, it now exists.
The excitement over the new major
has manifested in a rush to enroll in
this introductory class, with a wait-
list that currently boasts 63 students
and was at one point over 100.
With preference given to official
International Studies concentrators,
rumors are circulating that students
have begun declaring as CICS majors
solely to get into the overwhelmingly
popular class.
While it's designed as your basic
introductory course - a broad over-
view of various aspects of globaliza-
tion- Prof. Bradley Farnsworth has
added some wrinkles to the tradi-
tional formula. In addition discuss-
ing everything from "democracy, to
Chinese porcelain, to 'Avatar,' " Farn-
sworth will be bringing in 12 guest
lecturers throughout the semester to
provide a more localized focus.
Farnsworth seems likely to pro-
vide a refreshingly career-oriented
perspective to the course, already
making an effort to tie ideas of "cul-
tural imperialism" to actual real word
applications in only the second class.

Magazine Staff Writer

If you're looking for a fun class to
transfer into, Bruce Conforth's 'Beat-
niks, Hippies, and Punks' is not it. It's
not that the class is unpopular with
students- quite the contrary. After
the first day, the waitlist had over 50
students - far more than your aver-
age.
For anyone who has experienced
one of Conforth's courses, the long
waitlist isn't surprising. During his
second lecture of the semester, Con-
forth, clad in a leather vest and jeans,
played the song "What is Hip?" by
Tower of Power before warning, "one
thing you need to know is that what is
hip today could become passe."
If the auditory aides make the class
sound like a breeze, think again. Stu-
dents have to think in Conforth's class.
"Democracy in America is an inherent
contradiction," he explained in the
same lecture. It's "individuals versus
conformity."
Even after one lecture, AmCult
208 students seemed to have nothing
but positive things to say. LSA junior
Killian Brady said that since Conforth
grew up during the decade he teaches,
he "seems more authentic."
Conforth himself says the class's
popularity is because of the subject
matter. "I like to think it's a topic stu-
dents relate to," he said.

CAAS 358:
Michael Jackson
Race and Genius in
America
As students filed into the first lec-
ture for CAAS 358, "The Way You
Make Me Feel," "Black or White," and
"Thriller" played to a YouTube mash-
up of famous Michael Jackson music
videos. The course, more commonly
referred to as "the Michael Jackson
class," will focus on the legend's reign
as the King of Pop, from his portrayal
in the media to the role race played in
his life.
Held around a large conference
table in Haven Hall, every chair was
filled by the 30-something students
registered for the class, while those
on the extensive waitlist leaned
against the walls awaiting their fates.
Professor Nesha Haniff began by
sayingshe'd"neverbeensoinundated"
by a class before, going on to explain
that while most of the class promises
to be discussion and analysis-based,
guest lecturers will contribute top-
ics like the multicultural
aspects of
Jackson's
dance and
its impactr
on the
world.

tep back and view the sys-

tem as a whole, he said, that the perception
of how Greek members view LGBT people
changes.
"I think at the group level, kind of a pack
mentality (exists)," he said. "Whenever
someone starts jerking around and saying
(homophobic) things, but not necessarily
meant to be derogatory, that kind of feeds
into those perceptions."
John, a freshman in another IFC fra-
ternity, has only come out to a few of his
brothers. He spoke about his thought pro-
cess behind telling some of his brothers
that he is gay.
He said he first decided to come out to a
few of his fraternity brothers, mostly peo-
ple in his pledge class, just a few months
ago. He said he didn't want to tell everyone
because it's an extremely personal part of
his life that he doesn't want to share with
everyone.
"It's just kind of like a family history
story," John said. "Like you tell the people
close to you, a bonding thing. It's like get-
ting to know each other, gain their trust."
During the rush process, John said it
was important for him to find a frater-
nity that he felt would be accepting of his
sexual orientation. And while he said this
is a characteristic of his fraternity, some of
the others on campus may be a little more
close-minded.
John said that while he has received
positive responses from the brothers he's
told thus far, their reactions are generally
all the same: surprised.
"I get the same reaction, like 'no way,
like I don't see it at all,' and then I start
explaining and then it totally makes
sense," he said.
But because he is still not out to most
of his brothers, John feels that he still has
to act a certain way - especially in social
settings like fraternity parties, where the
brothers are expected to interact with
girls.
"If I just want to talk to my fraternity
brothers or something like that I can't do
that," he said. "Or if some of my LGBT
friends come over, I know, like, they're
always, like, 'Dude, why are you hanging
out with a bunch of dudes? Go find some
chicks.'Those are the guys that don't know
that say that to me."
John said that having to change how
he acts in certain situations is difficult for
him, and he has found himself having to
embrace some of the stereotypes of frater-
nity members to blend in more easily.
"You know, you kind of have to act a
certain way," he said. "It's kind of like not
a complete change of who I actually am as
a person; it's just the small details. I think
it's dumb that I have to focus my attention

on making sure I act that way because it's
kind ofthe antithesis of what I'm supposed
to be doing, but as of right now it's just the
small changes that I'm sure I'll get rid of."
John spoke about being most uncom-
fortable when his brothers ask him about
his sex life, something he said guys dis-
cuss on a regular basis, but that he avoids
divulging any information about.
Paul, a junior in an IFC fraternity who
is also only out to a few of his fraternity
brothers, expressed similar feelings of
having to change how he acts in certain
situations.
"There are comments Iusually wouldn't
be making if I were around friends who
knew," Paul said. "But you know you need
to put up some sort of fagade, it's part of
something that you learn growing up that
most people, most gay guys do and I've
talked to other gay guys who are the same
way. You just need to throw in a comment
here and there.
"Like, I've hooked up with girls in the
past, but it was really just to put on, you
know, a show, not for personal gratifica-
tion," he said.
Greg, a junior in an IFC fraternity,
hasn't yet come out to anyone in his fra-
ternity except for one other brother who is
also gay. His parents and a few of his close
friends know, but he said he doesn't feel
the need to share this information with his
entire fraternity.
"For me it's stupid because people don't
say 'Oh, by the way, I'm straight,' " Greg
said. "I don't feel the need to come out
because I'm going to act how I want to
act and I'm going to do what I want to do
regardless of what people know and what
people don't.
"I've had a relationship and I brought
my boyfriend around the house and I'm
sure some people knew and some people
didn't," he said. "But you just do what you
do and its atthe point that I'm comfortable
with myself to do what I want to do. I don't
feel the need to announce it."
ne major factor that contributes
to the perpetuation of the Greek
stereotype on campus is the lack
of visibility of gay students in fraternities.
Because many gay students feel uncom-
fortable coming out to their brothers and,
in turn, don't come out, people both inside
and outside the Greek community are
unaware gay members exist within the
system.
Gabe Javier, assistant director of the
Spectrum Center, the University office
for LGBT issues and awareness on cam-
pus, works with the executive boards of
all four Greek councils to promote LGBT

awareness in the Greek system. Javier,
who came out to his fraternity brothers as
an undergraduate at Rockhurst University
in Kansas City, Mo., spoke about the ste-
reotypes and perceptions that surround
the Greek community and the psychol-
ogy behind why many gay students feel
uncomfortable coming out.
Even if the perceptions are not true, if
the fraternity brothers would be accepting
of a brother who comes out, Javier said,
these issues need to be addressed because
those perceptions still exists.
"I think perception is reality, right?"
Javier said. "I think whether or not it's
true, if it's what you feel then it's what you
feel. So whether or not it's true that they
will be deactivated or beat up, if someone
thinks that's goingto happen, then there's
perception to be busted, myth to be bust-
ed."
To address these concerns, a group
called the Lambda Alliance was cre-
ated in 2007 that aims to bridge the gap
between the LGBT and Greek communi-
ties on campus. The group was founded by
members of all four Greek councils - in
collaboration with the Michigan Student
Assembly's LGBT Commission and the
Office of LGBT Affairs (this office changed
its name to the Spectrum Center in 2007)
- in an effort to combat the unfriendly
environment of the Greek system toward
LGBT students.
Kristefer Stojanovski, currently a Uni-
versitygraduatestudent,played an integral
part in the formation of Lambda Alliance.
Stojanovski came out to his fraternity, Chi
Psi, while he was an undergraduate at the
University.
Former-IFC president Jose Nunez was
also a member of Chi Psi at the time, and
upon hearing that his fraternity brother
had come out, Nunez realized there was a
need for a greater push for LGBT aware-
ness in the Greek system and worked with
Stokanovski to form the Lambda Alliance.
Since its formation, the Lambda Alli-
ance has held events like ally training
workshops, which aim to educate mem-
bers of the Greek system on how to be sup-
portive allies to LGBT brothers or sisters.
In 2007, around the same time the
Alliance was formed, the Office of LGBT
Affairs released a survey to the Greek sys-
tem to measure the community's level of
acceptance of LGBT people.
The survey asked questions that
addressed how people would feel about
a brother or sister coining out. Most said
that individually they would be comfort-
able with a brother or sister's coming out,
but that they thought their fraternity or

sidered joining. Even after him and his
friends received a bid to the same fra-
ternity, Alpha Delta Phi, Ohlinger still
opted against it.
It wasn't that Ohlinger didn't enjoy
the people he had met - some of his
best friends decided to join. But, rather,
Ohlinger thought he wouldn't be wel-
come in the fraternity once the brothers
found out he was gay.
"I didn't think the whole, being in
a frat and being gay went together at
all," Ohlinger said. "(I didn't know if) it
would be OK with those people having
guys come backto the frat... if it would be
awkward in front of people, or if people
would have a problem with it. So I just
turned down my bid right up front. They
gave it to me and I turned it down."
The following day, a few of the ADPhi
brothers called Ohlinger to ask why he'd
turned down the bid. "Oh, I didn't tell
you guys, but I'm gay," Ohlinger told the
brothers. "And they were, like, 'Oh, so
why'd you turn it down?"'
But even after turning down the bid,
he still hung out with some of the guys in
the fraternity, still attended parties with
them throughout the semester.
Throughout the rest of the fall semes-

grCLC1 LVLU 1Z"-1, 1 d lLU11
near the end of the fall semester that
Ohlinger seriously considered it.
"One of the older guys (in the fraterni-
ty) came up to me the end of the semes-
ter. He was always telling people he was
homophobic, just that kind of person,"
Ohlinger said. "And I forget what he said
exactly, but he said 'I just wanted to say
I hope you rush the house, because you
made me question what I always thought
(about gay people).'
"So what I was thinking," Ohlinger
said, "what it really came down to was,
if I could change the opinion of how 60
straight frat guys viewed one gay per-
son, or the whole gay community, while
I hung out with my best friends and had
a really good time, why wouldn't I do it?
So I ended up deciding to do it."
Ohlinger rushed ADPhi that winter
and hasn't looked back since. "It was
this huge relief," he said. "There were
no negative outcomes. So many people
surprised me by the things they said and
they did.
"I'd do anything for a lot of the guys
in there," Ohlinger said of his broth-
ers. "For me to keep something like that
from them would be horrible and would
