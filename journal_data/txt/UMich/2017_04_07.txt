Despite 
frigid 

temperatures, 
about 
100 

students 
and 
community 

members marched through 
the streets of Ann Arbor 
on Thursday night to “take 
back the night” and raise 
awareness for sexual assault 
on college campuses.

Though 
Take 
Back 
the 

Night is believed to have 
originated 
in 
19th-century 

London 
when 
women 

marched for safer streets, 
it has since evolved into an 
international 
movement 
of 

over 1,000 annual marches 
and rallies. These events, 
such as the one in Ann Arbor, 
work to provide a safe place 
for survivors of sexual assault 
to come together and share 
their stories.

Take Back the Night and 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Students 
Against 
Rape 

organized the Ann Arbor 
march and rally, and allowed 
organizations with similar 
goals 
such 
as 
SafeHouse, 

Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 

and Awareness Center and 
Planned Parenthood to table 
inside the Michigan Union, 
where the rally was held.

Ann Arbor residents Tom 

and Pam Swider kicked off 
the rally, themed “The Power 
of Words,” noting it was their 
ninth year of organizing the 
event and the 39th annual 

rally in Ann Arbor.

Pam Swider emphasized 

the importance of the rally as 
a way to create an accessible 
space for victims of assault 
to reach out to others, as well 
as to overcome the feeling of 
shame that sometimes follows 
an assault.

“Shame is such a powerful 

and harsh aspect of sexual 
violence,” she said. “But the 
more we talk about it, the 
easier it is for someone who 
has been assaulted to reach 
out to others for support and 
help.”

State Sen. Rebekah Warren 

(D–Ann 
Arbor) 
gave 
the 

opening 
address, 
during 

which she emphasized the 
power of events like Take 
Back the Night to incite 
dialogue surrounding sexual 
assault. She presented the 
statistic that only 20 percent

of

Bicentennial 

Office held a Feast of Ideas 
on Thursday night, providing 
an “intellectual sampler” of 
short talks representing some 
of the University’s academic 
offerings.

More 
than 
a 
dozen 

University staff and professors 
went to local businesses around 
Ann Arbor as part of one of 
the University’s bicentennial 
celebrations 
intended 
to 

highlight 
the 
University’s 

impact and contributions to 
the community-at-large.

The 
multi-part 
event 

featured 
a 
diverse 
lineup 

of 
professors, 
providing 

expertise in all areas of the 
University.

In a University press release, 

Michelle 
French, 
associate 

director of the Bicentennial 
Office, said the event was 
intended to strengthen the 
ties between the Ann Arbor 
community and the University 
it houses.

Covering 
 
issues 
such 
as 
higher 

education 
and 
influencing 

change 
through 
academia, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

highlighted on Thursday what 
he considers the importance 
of being a research institution 
socially, 
economically 
and 

internationally.

However, Schlissel veered 

from the central topic of the 
colloquium — a President’s 
Bicentennial Colloquium event 
held at the Rackham Graduate 
School featuring four former 
University presidents, including 
Harold T. Shapiro, James J. 
Duderstadt, Lee C. Bollinger 
and Mary Sue Coleman — to 
speak about issues he found 
more significant: immigration 
and a university’s responsibility 
to speak out within the current 
political climate.

“The challenge we’re going 

to confront in this very political 
era is: How do we walk that line 

between picking on issues that 
we can contribute to that make 
our mission stronger, make our 
University stronger and more 
valuable to society without 
being categorized or dismissed 
as inappropriately acting in 
the political space?” Schlissel 
asked.

Beforehand, 
Gary 
Krenz, 

director 
of 
bicentennial 

planning, 
wrote 
in 
an 

email interview the event’s 
significance was twofold.

“First, to be able to have a 

group of people together who, 
all told, can reflect on such a 
large portion of the University’s 
history 
is 
very 
exciting,” 

Krenz wrote. “It allows us 
to compare similarities and 
differences across time. Second, 
these presidents collectively 
represent an amazing amount 
of experience in higher ed 
leadership, so having them 
together to discuss challenges 
will be very enlightening.”

engagement, was joined by

Students, faculty members also face challenges, see room for improvement with the portal

School of Information Prof. 

Charles Severance has been 
interested in Massive Open 
Online 
Courses 
since 
the 

moment he was first introduced 
to them.

“When MOOCs came along in 

2011 or 2012, I was like, ‘this is 
going to be the biggest use of the 
internet for teaching that the 
world’s ever seen, and I got to be 
part of it,’ ” Severance said. “So 

I sort of shoved my way in and 
got to be part of the first round 
of courses that the University of 
Michigan published on Coursera 
(a host website for MOOCs), 
which were really the first real 
MOOCs.”

Just as Severance expected, 

MOOCs have exploded in the 
past five years, and both he 
and the University have been 
on the cutting edge of MOOCs 
production ever since.

James DeVaney, the associate 

vice 
provost 
for 
academic 

innovation for the University, 

told the Daily in an email 
interview the University was 
one of the first four schools 
to partner with Coursera in 
2012. Since then, the school has 
produced over 100 MOOCs and 
forged strong partnerships with 
both Coursera and edX, another 
host website for MOOCs.

Currently, the University’s 

MOOCs alone have reached over 
5.6 million people from around 
the world, according to DeVaney, 
and the University shows no 
signs of slowing production any 
time soon.

“It’s really pretty when it’s 

done, but it takes a lot longer 
than it used to.”

The first major MOOC — 

an introduction to artificial 
intelligence — was launched 
by Stanford University in 2011, 
and out of this experiment 
came MOOC provider websites. 
In most cases, these providers 
act as intermediaries between 
universities 
and 
“learners,” 

which is the MOOC-jargon term 
for a student.

Amid heavy rain and wind on 

Thursday, the National Weather 

Service warned of possible Huron 

River flooding in Ann Arbor, 

according to MLive.

Wednesday evening, the 

National Weather Service issued a 

hydrologic outlook report, noting 

potential flooding in the area, 

including Swartz Creek in Flint and 

the Huron River.

As of Thursday afternoon, the 

river reached 14.9 feet. At 15 feet, it 

could flood Riverside Park, Island 

Park and the Fuller Recreation Area 

— frequented city destinations. At 16 

feet, the dirt parking lot of Riverside 

could face flooding and nearby city 

drains could face backups.

The river’s “action stage,” which 

requires the National Weather 

Service or a partner to mitigate 

effects, occurs at 13.5 feet. Its “flood 

stage” occurs at 16 feet, according to 

the National Weather Service. 

A special weather statement 

released around 8:30 p.m. Thursday 

night indicates light snowfall across 

the region for the remainder of the 

evening. The statement also warns 

of slippery conditions on roadways, 

wind gusts up to 45 mph and 

decreased visibility due to snow.

A wind advisory was in effect 

until 6:00 a.m. Friday morning.

ON THE DAILY: STORM MAY CAUSE FLOODING IN HURON RIVER

Students eat lunch with University alum Dr. Allison Davis, cultural property analyst in the Cultural Heritage Center of the U.S. 
Department of State, to discuss her career in Latin America on Thursday.

CONVE R SATIONALIST

of assaults are reported, and 
Take Back the Night raises 
awareness for such a relevant 
issue.

“For 
one 
night 
every 

year, the rally provides an 
exceptional 
opportunity 

to raise awareness for this 
issue that is so critical, and 
unfortunately for many of us, 
too close to home,” Warren 
said. “So we march tonight, we 
rally today in solidarity, with 
countless survivors.”

In lieu of a keynote speaker, 

event organizers chose to have 
Public Health student Traci 
Ayub 
and 
LSA 
sophomore 

Vivian Trutzl recite personal 
poems 
regarding 
their 

experiences 
with 
sexual 

violence.

“It was from a rape poem 

that I discovered I was a 
survivor too,” Trutzl said. 
“Keep writing rape poems, 
keep getting pissed.”

Throughout 
the 
event, 

volunteer 
psychological 

counselors, 
identifiable 

by white arm bands, were 
available for those who needed 
to discuss the heavy subject 
matter. Furthermore, those 
who chose to identify as 
survivors wore teal armbands.

March participant Kimmy 

Thompson, 
a 
student 
at 

Concordia University, said she 
believes getting students to 
participate in sexual assault 
awareness is more impactful 
than using adults and other 
organizations.

“Get 
students 
involved, 

make it heard through the 
students,” she said. “Adults 
and organizations can say all 
they want, but making the 
issue more student driven is 
important.”

Following the completion 

of 
the 
speeches, 
march 

participants picked up colorful 
signs 
and 
blue 
balloons, 

signifying those killed in acts 
of sexual violence, and began 
reciting the organization’s list 
of demands. These demands 
ranged from “no means no” 
to ending sexual violence and 
other forms of oppression.

Once outside, the group 

released the balloons into the 
air as a symbol of hope for 
survivors, before commencing 
the march and chanting to end 
sexual assault. 

LSA junior Kelly Guerin, 

student leader of Michigan 
Takes Back the Night, said 
she 
first 
became 
involved 

with the organization after 
taking a self-defense class in 
high school and realizing she 
wanted to get involved with 
sexual assault prevention on 
campus.

“I’m a junior now, but when 
I was a senior in high school, 
they made all the girls take 
a self-defense course, and 
half the self-defense course 
was about awareness about 
rape and sexual assault and 
how to prevent it on college 
campuses, and the second 
half was self-defense,” she 
said. “I did karate so I knew 
all about the self-defense 
part of it, but I really 
wanted to get more involved 
with the activism side of it, 
because I was never really 
exposed to that in high 
school.”

She explained how the 

organization 
aided 
her 

in deciding to become a 
lawyer, as well as largely 
impacted her life in general.

“I feel like it’s really 

impacted my life because 
I want to be a lawyer, I 
want to advocate for people 
who are victims of rape 
and sexual assault, so this 
organization has definitely 
had a huge impact on my 
life,” she said.

Interim Provost Paul Courant, 
who was a moderator of the event 
and introduced the overarching 
topic to be addressed.

“The bargain between the 

research university and society 
is under much greater stress 
than we imagined it could or 
would be,” Courant said before 
introducing Shapiro.

Shapiro, who was president of 

the University from 1980 to 1987, 
agreed with Courant’s initial 
sentiments.

“It is critical to acknowledge 

as a nation we currently face an 
environment characterized by 
such a high level of cultural, social, 
economic and political anxiety,” 
Shapiro 
said. 
“Michigan’s 

commitments to its teaching 
and research programs rest on 
a 
foundational 
commitment 

that facts do matter and that 
centuries of scholarship have 
created a legacy that continues to 
contribute to the ongoing vitality 
of our society.”

Duderstadt, 
who 
held 
the 

position from 1988 to 1996, 
followed Shapiro’s thoughts on 
the role of scholarship in a modern 
liberal state by adopting a phrase 
that considers the University 
a 
“privately 
supported 
but 

publicly committed institution.” 
Duderstadt 
acknowledged 

contemporary 
challenges 
the 

University may face.

“More 
specifically, 
our 

challenges have been first, to 
develop a financial paradigm that 

could address the disappearance 
of state support and second, 
to 
sustain 
our 
fundamental 

mission,” Duderstadt said.

Bollinger, president of the 

University from 1996 to 2001, 
considered 
the 
University’s 

responsibility 
to 
be 
engaged 

in the current political sphere, 
which Schlissel echoed in his 
comments later.

Bollinger 
recognized 
the 

ability 
of 
the 
University 
to 

bring the next generation into 
an intellectual life, and the 
important role of universities to 
establish an understanding of 
issues of social importance.

“You can’t have a love of 

humankind unless you start with 
a deep sense of love and affection 
for 
the 
people 
immediately 

around you,” Bollinger said. “We 
have to be in alignment more or 
less with human needs and issues 
and I’ve come to believe that 
we are not in proper alignment 
today.”

Coleman, 
who 
was 
the 

University’s first female president 
and served from 2002 to 2014, 
focused her individual speech on 
the efforts she took to digitize the 
University’s books.

“By digitizing today’s books 

through our own efforts and 
partnerships with others, we are 
protecting the written word for all 
time,” Coleman said. “By making 
them available online, we would 
expose them to the possibility of 
commercial success.”

Schlissel 
though 
quickly 

pivoted the conversation to a 
conflicting set of political issues.

“In the public space, our 

political 
leaders 
are 
talking 

about 
clamping 
down 
on 

immigration as a mechanism 
to make our nation safer, and 
it’s certainly a legitimate worry 
of the government to make the 
United States as safe as possible 
for its citizens,” Schlissel said. 
“Many people are concerned in 
this era of economic insecurity 
that immigrants may somehow 
make it harder for them to get a 
job.”

Yet Schlissel referred to the 

presence of students who benefit 
from the Deferred Action for 
Child Arrivals program in the 
University 
community 
and 

those 
affected 
by 
President 

Donald Trump’s recent ban on 
immigration from predominantly 
Muslim countries.

“Here’s 
the 
challenge 
for 

us: Not only are we a nation of 
immigrants, we are a university 
of immigrants,” Schlissel said. 
“The 
folks 
that 
come 
here 

to do research are actually 
contributing to the innovation 
pipeline that comes out of our 
great University … The students 
that we educate here that go back 
to their own country, they take a 
little bit of America with them. 
They demystify our country.”

Schlissel finalized his remarks 

by noting his necessity as a 
University leader to speak out 
ethically and morally.

Krenz, a professor for the 

bicentennial course Philosophy 
162, The University of Michigan: 
A 
Moral 
Institution, 
had 
a 

number of students present at 
the event, including Engineering 
senior Jesse Newton. 

“(The class focuses on) mostly 

just the role of the University 
and how they play in society and 
different ethical problems that 
the University can run into,” 
Newton said. “We went over 
in class before we came to this 
Shapiro’s role in making us a more 
exclusive university, Duderstadt’s 
role in focusing on engineering 
and that science (and) Coleman’s 
role in development of the North 
Campus Research Center.”

Elizabeth Harlow had posed 
a question to the panel of how 
a university president can be 
effective in exercising power in 
the political realm, especially in 
response to Bollinger’s discussion 
of the evolution of a global 
communication system. Later, 
Harlow said she believed the 

presidents were appropriate in 
their responses.

“I 
thought 
that 
the 

conversation 
about 
academic 

freedom 
and 
the 
existential 

threat of the political climate to 
what a university is was really 
fascinating,” Harlow said. “I’m 
a member of the graduate class 
that’s been convened around the 
question of the bargain between 
the University and society and 
it’s something that we’ve been 
struggling with all term and it 
was really interesting to think 
about how the University can and 
needs to negotiate the political.”

Robin Washington, ’84 alum 

and member of the President’s 
Advisory 
Council, 
said 
she 

wished more current students 
had attended the event.

“It’s 
phenomenal 
to 
bring 

together all the ex-presidents 
and 
get 
their 
perspectives,” 

Washington said. “It’s clear to see 
their passion for the school, but 
also their acute awareness of the 
importance of the University as 
well as the culture and tradition, 
which I think they all have great 
respect for.”

Washington noted Schlissel’s 

ability to navigate significant 
issues in a local and national 
context.

“It’s rare to get that type 

of continuity and just to hear 
the likeness of thought, the 
complementary, but also the 
variation in their viewpoints 
of what matters,” Washington 
said. “I love (Schlissel’s) courage 
and his awareness to talk about 
critical but politically sensitive 
issues.”

University President Mark Schlissel discusses the “Evolving Bargain between Research Universities and Society” at the President’s Bicentennial 
Colloquium in Rackham on Thursday.

“We 
want 
to 
provide 

a 
sampling 
of 
what 
our 

students 
experience 
every 

day in the classroom,” she 
said. “We’re pleased to work 
with 
local 
merchants 
to 

connect the campus with the 
community.”

Barry Fishman, a professor 

in the Schools of Information 
and Education, gave one such 
talk — “School is a Game … 
But is it a GOOD game?” –– 
at 826michigan, a writing 
workshop that provides free 
tutoring for K-12 students 
in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and 
Detroit.

In 
his 
talk, 
Fishman 

criticized the way the K-12 
system is designed, saying 
it 
discourages 
risk-taking 

and intellectual creativity. 
Asking the audience what 
they most wanted out of 
education or their children’s 
education, 
many 
audience 

members agreed that student 
engagement and investment 
in the learning process were 
most important.

“Where high school used 

to be preparation for college, 
it is now preparation for your 
college application,” Fishman 
said. “The fear is that if I 
make one mistake, I won’t be 
able to apply to the college I 
want.”

Suggesting 
education 

should be designed like a 
game, Fishman stated any 
successful video game also 
provides a good learning 
environment.

“A really good game gets 

you involved to the level 
where you feel like you’re a 
partner with the character, 
or you are the character,” he 
said. “I would argue that’s 
actually the ultimate aim 
of literature, or science or 
anything. When students are 
in science class, you want 
them to be thinking like a 
scientist, and that’s a very 
important challenge.”

a double is $10,872 per 
occupant and a triple is 
$9,612, dependent on size 
and 
whether 
the 
rooms 

include private bathrooms. 
The 
average 
costs 
for 

next year are expected to 
increase to $13,363 for a 
single, $11,198 for a double 
and $9,900 for a triple.

The cost hike is necessary 

to 
maintaining 
a 
high 

standard of living in the 
residence halls, with the 
3-percent increase identical 
to the rate increases in the 
past two years, according to 
Shetty.

“The 
rate 
increase 

reflects 
the 
increasing 

cost 
of 
operations 
and 

improvements 
to 
the 

residence halls,” Shetty said.

Rushton said the RHA’s 

goal is to maintain a high 
standard of living and food 
quality for residents while 
keeping costs under control 
as much as possible.

“Ultimately, 
we 
want 

things to be affordable,” 
Rushton said. “If students 
are to come to this university 
they need to be able to pay 
for it — and not just through 
receiving aid.”

While the rate of inflation 

in the United States has been 
2.2 percent, Rushton said 
this 3-percent increase in 
funding is expected and will 
likely remain at a similar 
level in the future. 

“It is a continual effort; 

it’s not something where 
we say ‘well now we never 
need to improve again,’ ” 
Rushton said. “We don’t see 
a foreseeable drop in the 
future because we always 
need to be improving.”

While the RHA committee 

approved of the 1-percent 
operations 
increase, 
they 

conditionally endorsed the 
2-percent RLI increase if, in 
the long term, an alternative 
source of funding can be 
found.

“A one percent increase 

to room and board rates 
for operational purposes is 
modest,” the committee’s 
recommendations 
stated. 

“The Committee approves 
the 
two 
percent 
rates 

increase for RLI this coming 
year, although expects a new 
financing solution to be fully 
fledged to the satisfaction 
of the residential student 
body.”

The 
passed 
resolution 

also states the RHA believes 
the burden of the RLI costs 
should not continue to fall 
on University residents, and 
there should be an alteration 
in the future.

“RHA believes that the 

current system of annual 
2% 
increases 
in 
Room 

and Board Rates for the 
Residence 
Life 
Initiative 

(RLI) is not sustainable long 
term, and that the burden of 
RLI improvements should 
not continue to fall upon the 
residents of the university,” 
the passed resolution states.

was one of the first four 
universities to partner with 
MOOC 
provider 
Coursera, 

launching 
its 
first 
course 

through the platform in 2012.

In fall 2015, the University 

also aligned with edX. With 
over 
100 
courses 
currently 

running or in production, the 
school is now well on its way 
to accomplishing its goal of 
transforming over 200 courses 
into full-fledged MOOCs by 
the end of 2017, according to 
DeVaney.

In the early days of University 

MOOCs, professors were mostly 
self-motivated, creating entire 
courses by themselves in their 
spare time. Severance said his 
first MOOC, a course about the 
history of the internet, which 
he describes as a way to turn 
history buffs into technology 
nerds, 
arose 
out 
of 
pretty 

rudimentary materials.

“In 2012, we just found a way,” 

Severance said. “In the early 
days, I just bought a camera and 
stuck it on my computer and 
started talking … you used to be 
able to get these things done in a 
weekend!”

Two years later, in 2014, as 

MOOC production started to 
pick up, the University started 
looking for a way to incorporate 
them into the greater University 
experience. This spurred the 
creation of the Digital Education 
& Innovation Lab, now housed 
within the Office of Academic 
Innovation. Today, MOOCs are 
collaborative projects between 
the instructors of the courses 
and the DEIL, which is home to 
studios where instructors can 
film their classes.

In Severance’s opinion, this 

change is positive, but he noted 
it also comes with its own 
difficulties. MOOCs now require 
a major time commitment from 
instructors — gone are the days 
when an entire course could be 
completed in a weekend.

“Now, it’s very organized 

and 
there 
are 
professional 

studios and professional camera 
people with professional lights, 
professional 
microphones, 

professional 
everything,” 

Severance 
said. 
“It’s 
really 

pretty when they’re done, but 
it takes a lot longer than it used 
to.”

Currently, MOOCs generally 

take about three to six months 
to complete, and the process 
involves many more people than 
it did five years ago. DeVaney 
said MOOCs are now much more 
collaboratively created.

“Faculty submit a proposal 

first to their college or school 
and then to a University-level 
faculty committee for feedback 
and approval,” DeVaney said. 
“Once approved, the faculty 

team will work with the Office 
of 
Academic 
Innovation 
to 

design and develop the new 
MOOC.”

Always 
on 
the 
forefront 

of 
MOOC 
production, 
the 

University has several bigger 
projects in the works that are 
among the first of their kind.

Last month, the Office of 

Academic Innovation announced 
at its Innovation Forum the 
University would begin a Teach-
Out Series to inform the public 
on a large scale about current 
issues. Dean of Libraries James 
Hilton, who is also the vice 
provost for academic innovation, 
said the courses would help 
inform citizens about relevant 
current events topics on a large 
scale.

“The University of Michigan 

Teach-Out Series can be a model 
for a new era of engagement 
between institutions of higher 
education 
and 
the 
global 

communities 
they 
serve,” 

Hilton said at the forum. “Part 
of our public mission is to create 
opportunities for citizens to 
be informed, because the more 
informed people are, the more 
informed debate can be.”

Additionally, students in a 

School of Natural Resources 
and Environment seminar are 
creating the first-ever student-
led 
MOOC, 
which 
will 
be 

released in early May.

“They’re only going to help 

us.”

Though the University is a 

big proponent of MOOCs, there 
are some aspects of the process 
that seem daunting to potential 
instructors.

As 
mentioned 
above, 
the 

time 
commitment 
can 
be 

nerve-wracking 
for 
some. 

Rachel Niemer, the director 
of the University’s Gameful 
Learning Lab, recently made 
a 
MOOC 
about 
gameful 

learning pedagogy with Barry 
Fishman, a professor from the 
Information School and the 
School of Education. She said 
Fishman came to the project 
with concerns about how much 
time the project would take up.

“In the beginning, Barry … 

was nervous about how much 
time it was going to take,” she 
said. “In the end, he ended 
up being a much bigger fan of 
the process than he expected 
to be. Most people find that 
it’s challenging to figure out 
how to fit it all together, but I 
think faculty are pretty used to 
situations where they had to (do 
that).”

DeVaney 
echoed 
Niemer’s 

sentiments, saying most faculty 
find the MOOC creation process 
to be rewarding and informative.

“The most common feedback 

from faculty is that the effort 
required to create a MOOC 
was more than they expected, 
(but) that the experience was 
transformative, 
that 
they’ll 

never teach on campus the 
same way, and that they want to 
create another,” DeVaney said.

This 
idea 
of 
changing 

campus climate is one that 
comes up frequently in talks 
about MOOCs, and people are 
generally 
undecided 
about 

whether this change will be 
for better or for worse. Here 
at 
the 
University, 
though, 

most people think the rise of 
MOOCs will only improve the 
college experience. Severance 
thinks there’s no possibility 
of harm from MOOCs — only 
improvement.

“They’re only going to help 

us,” he said. “There might be 
others that are harmed by this, 
but not us. I think ultimately 
what is going to happen is 
we are going to find ways to 
smooth everybody’s transition 
into higher education and have 
people arrive on campus better 
prepared to make the most of 
their time on campus with us. 
We will teach less remedial stuff 
and more fun stuff.”

“We’re going to continue to 

break this mold of what a MOOC 
is.”

Of course, MOOCs are not 

perfect, 
and 
the 
University 

constantly working to improve 
them. One area Niemer is trying 
to change is the relatively 
rigid pedagogical structure of 
MOOCs. Her course, which was 
released last month on edX, is 
about gameful learning, and it 
was important to Niemer that 
the class use the method she 
was trying to teach. This proved 
to be difficult.

“MOOC platforms tend to 

assume one kind of delivery, 
and they’re really designed 
with an implicit pedagogy,” 
she said. “And even though 
MOOCs themselves are really 
innovative, I see that as a space 
for further innovation. Over the 
next few years, we’re going to 
continue to break this mold of 
what a MOOC is and really bring 
new and exciting … learning 
experiences.”

Natural 
Resources 
and 

Environment student Dahlia 
Rockowitz is currently enrolled 
in the MOOC creation seminar 
and has had the unique ability 
to 
experience 
MOOCs 
as 

both a learner and a creator. 
She and her classmates in 
the 
seminar 
are 
creating 

a 
course, 
tentatively 
titled 

ActOn Climate, which aims to 
introduce learners to climate 
action by presenting different 
ways people experience the 
environment.

Though Rockowitz enjoys the 

creation process and finds it to 
be a great experience, she said 
being both a full-time student 
and an instructor has some 
challenges, especially within 
the MOOC format.

“We’re 
trying 
to 
do 

something brand new, in that 

we’re designing a brand-new 
course and it’s people most of 
whom don’t have a background 
in online education,” she said. 
“Everyone’s really committed to 
making sure the MOOC is really 
interesting and engaging and 
motivating, but also recognizing 
that we have other obligations 
of students and the timeline of 
the world doesn’t always match 
up with the timeline of the 
University of Michigan.”

Rockowitz sees some room 

for 
improvement 
from 
the 

learner’s side of MOOCs, too. 
She thinks more engagement 
and communication between 
students is necessary for future 
MOOCs. 

“I 
remember 
thinking 
it 

was really cool to be sitting in 
my living room and watching 
a lecture,” Rockowitz said. “I 
remember it being hard to wrap 
my head around that there 
were so many other people like 
me around the world taking 
the course … I also remember 
wanting to dedicate more time 
to (a) course than I actually 
could. There are quizzes and 
assignments and stuff, but not 
that 
same 
accountability 
… 

also, I’m a people person, and it 
would’ve been nice to interact 
with others.”

On the other hand, LSA 

freshman Boyang Yu felt the 
fluidity and independence of the 
MOOCs he’s taken were major 
assets to the courses. While he 
has not taken any MOOCs since 
coming to the University, he 
completed two in high school 
and greatly enjoyed them.

“I’m not one of those people 

who needs to study in groups 
and I really like the freedom a 
MOOC has of starting whenever 
you 
want 
and 
repeating 

whatever you want,” Yu said. 
“In certain ways, it works better 
than physical classes.”

MOOCs are a new concept, 

and they will undoubtedly grow 
and change. The focus going 
forward, though, will likely be 
on what the learners want — 
whether it’s more structure, like 
Rockowitz prefers, or less, as Yu 
would like. Regardless of what 
changes will be made, the most 
important thing, as Severance 
said, will be improving access 
to a University of Michigan 
education to anyone around the 
globe.

“(The 
learners 
are) 
the 

reason I got into it,” Severance 
said. “I got into it to impact 
lots of lives in a positive way. I 
love programming and I love 
technology and I think everyone 
should love it, but I can’t get to 
meet everyone. With the MOOC, 
I can affect all these people’s 
lives in a positive way, and there 
are tons and tons of stories 
about people who take one class 
and it changes their life … that is 
so gratifying … I’m the luckiest 
person in the world!”

O

n Saturday, I participated 
in Detroit Partnership’s 
annual 
Detroit 

Partnership Day for the 
second year in a row. 
This time, thankfully, 
there 
was 
no 
self-

congratulatory rhetoric 
or 
encouragement 

to “fix Detroit.” We 
were there to learn 
about the community, 
do what we could in 
the few hours we had 
and leave with the 
understanding that we 
hadn’t even made a dent 
in the process. Residents thanked 
us, but no one praised us for being 
decent, as they had in years past. 
Because of this, I was afforded the 
clarity to connect with residents of 
the city, and in doing so, I realized 
the extent of their resilience in the 
face of extreme adversity.

My 
group 
was 
sent 
to 

Brightmoor, a four-square-mile 
residential district on the city’s 
northwest 
side, 
characterized 

by abandoned homes, mounds of 
garbage and a savannah’s worth 
of overgrown grass. It’s an area 
so presumably rough that people 
who attempt to be clever and edgy 
have nicknamed it “Blightmoor.” 
A little online digging revealed 
it was once a stable community 
for working-class families to 
purchase affordable housing, but it 
took a hit after population decline 
and institutional racism worked 
their ways through Detroit like 
tornadoes. Now it’s a ghost town, a 
reminder of the city’s devastating 
decline. At least, that’s what the 
dominant narrative dictates — but 
it’s far from the truth.

Our first stop in Brightmoor 

was 
a 
park 
with 
wooden 

benches wrapped around a 
large tree in an amphitheater-
type fashion. A neighborhood 
organizer spoke to us about the 
residents’ 
accomplishments: 

They built a greenhouse, they 
grow their own food, they run 
their own leadership academy 
for the neighborhood’s ambitious 
children. Following her speech, 
we broke off into our groups and 
received our assignments.

My group was paired with a 

guy around his mid-30s named 
Andrew, who pulled the 10 or so 
of us to his house in a makeshift 
flatbed trailer. When we arrived, 
he explained our tasks (turn over 
the dirt in the gardens, remove 
the tree stump near the beehive, 
etc.) and distributed some tools. 
Soon, we were joined by his three 
children, the eldest of whom was 

only four, digging and chatting 
excitedly alongside us.

I was bursting at the seams 

with 
questions, 

but 
Andrew 
was 

preoccupied 
with 

making maple syrup 
over the fire, so I 
waited 
until 
his 

wife emerged from 
the house to begin 
my inquiry.

With a cautious 

eye 
on 
her 

daughters, his wife 
told me she had 

lived in Brightmoor 

her whole life and that the 
area had actually improved 
significantly in recent years, 
contrary 
to 
what 
people 

believe about it. Because city 
services are scarce, residents 
of 
the 
neighborhood 
have 

been 
developing 
innovative 

alternatives. 
For 
example, 

instead of waiting hours for 
police to arrive to the scene of 
a crime, they created a texting 
system that sends a crime alert 
to neighbors, who can organize 
and chase away the perpetrator.

One of the biggest problems, 

she 
explained, 
was 
people 

commuting from the suburbs 
to dump trash into empty lots 
around 
the 
neighborhood, 

rather than paying to have it 
dumped in a landfill. She told me 
her husband had chased these 
invaders out of the neighborhood 
on numerous occasions and 
even took their information 
to the police, but nothing had 
come of it. The city is slow to 
demolish abandoned properties, 
too, and residents often have to 
personally board up the houses, 
which seem to inevitably catch 
fire and burn down.

Despite the local government’s 

complete 
disregard 
for 
the 

area, 
she 
spoke 
highly 
of 

the neighborhood’s sense of 
solidarity and strength. She 
described the various gardens 
and farms — honey, vegetables 
and even something called a 

“pizza 
farm,” 
which 
grows 

tomatoes for an annual pizza 
picnic — and gushed about the 
park down the road, which had 
new equipment, winding trails 
and nearby Little Free Libraries. 
Though she said she worried 
about the local elementary school 
closing because of population 
decline, she seemed confident in 
the abilities of both the charter 
schools and the resident-run 
educational programs to pick up 
the slack.

At the end of the day, my 

group waved goodbye to the 
family, boarded the bus and 
headed back to Ann Arbor 
in the detached manner that 
spontaneous 
community 

service dictates. But something 
must have stuck, because I 
haven’t 
stopped 
thinking 

about the neighborhood since. 
How can a community so 
egregiously neglected by the 
people designated to serve it 
manage to essentially govern 
itself? What will happen to 
Brightmoor in the next five 
years? Ten?

I didn’t tell this story to 

push the age-old “bootstraps” 
narrative that everyone can 
be successful if they just work 
hard enough. No one deserves 
the kind of gross callousness 
and disregard for human life 
that permits heaps of trash to 
be dumped on their property, 
near their homes, around the 
areas where their children 
play. No one should have to wait 
hours for police to respond to 
their requests for help. No one 
should have to grow their own 
food out of necessity, because 
they cannot afford or access a 
marketplace.

No, 
my 
mixture 
of 

astonishment and anger comes 
from watching people serve 
themselves when they can no 
longer rely on others to serve 
them. Detroit may be bouncing 
back, but it’s not because of 
gentrification 
in 
Midtown 

or expensive downtown and 
riverfront developments — it’s 
because its residents are sick 
and tired of being treated like 
shit by their own government, 
and they’re doing something 
about it. When all is said 
and 
done, 
Detroit 
doesn’t 

need University of Michigan 
students to save it; it’s saving 
itself from the inside.

U

niversities 
are, 
by 

definition, 
places 
of 

learning and growth. 

And while I’d say a 
vast majority of my 
learning happens in 
the 
classroom 
and 

through my personal 
engagement 
with 

class material, there 
are still some things 
school can’t teach you.

I lean on some 

outside 
sources 

for 
personal 

betterment, such as 
online tutorials, interpersonal 
relationships and séances with 
spirits. And for everything else, 
there’s MasterCard.

Just kidding, I actually rely 

on eavesdropping.

I honestly don’t intend to 

eavesdrop; sometimes I’ll even 
actively avoid it with earbuds 
and a 20-foot-wide personal 
bubble. 
However, 
Americans 

are notoriously noisy people, 
and my first-floor apartment 
gets a lot of foot traffic outside, 
so sometimes I’m made privy to 
pieces of knowledge I’m perhaps 
not meant to be in on.

From 
these 
accidental 

eavesdropping 
sessions, 
I’ve 

learned 
about 
gossip 
and 

parties on campus, found out it’s 
extremely common for people 
to sing while walking alone 
and heard bits of discussion on 
topics ranging from grades to 
relationships to why the phrase 
“tight budget” doesn’t sound 
quite right.

Occasionally, 
though, 
the 

things I inadvertently snoop 
on can be extremely thought-
provoking. Recently, I overheard 
someone 
worry 
aloud 
that 

sending a thank-you note to their 
former host family would be an 
annoyance or a burden of some 

sort since they probably receive 
tons of that sort of thing.

The person’s companion (out 

loud) and I (silently) 
were 
in 
complete 

agreement: Showing 
gratitude is rarely a 
waste or unwanted, 
and that host family 
would 
probably 

be thrilled to hear 
something kind and 
unprovoked from that 
individual. Plus, the 
person would benefit 

in return from having 

conveyed the thanks.

According to a TED Talk by 

David Steindl-Rast, “It is not 
happiness that makes us grateful. 
It’s gratefulness that makes us 
happy.” It may seem like happy 
people have the most to be 
grateful for and the people being 
thanked would benefit most from 
demonstrations 
of 
gratitude, 

but the ones doing the thanking 
may actually emotionally benefit 
more than anyone.

Research 
on 
gratitude 

also 
demonstrates 
that, 
for 

emotionally 
mature 
people, 

showing thankfulness is not only 
connected to greater happiness 
but also increased optimism, 
healthier 
social 
relationships 

and better physical health than 
those who are less forthcoming 
with their thanks.

In 
my 
opinion, 
being 

cognizant of the ones who 
helped you get to where you are 
can be an exercise in humility as 
well as in gratitude. While U.S. 
culture often puts emphasis on 
individuals in driving their own 
fate — pulling yourself up by 
your bootstraps and all that — 
it’s important to recognize that 
everything you’ve built has been 
made possible by the people who 
have supported you in the past.

So, knowing the wonderful 

benefits of showing gratitude, 
and knowing that I would 
be 
neither 
successful 
nor 

graduating without some of the 
wonderful people in my life, I 
would like to do a quick bout of 
thank-you’s before the proverbial 
award ceremony music comes to 
play me out.

I have to thank my parents for 

financing me, feeding me, driving 
me to school when I missed the 
bus and a small handful of other 
things. I appreciate it.

I’d like to thank my lovely 

professors for not only putting 
together amazing lesson plans 
and teaching me so much, 
but also for their noble but 
ineffective efforts to get me to 
speak in class. Sorry about that.

To my wonderful friends: I 

have nothing snarky to say here, 
I just really appreciate that you 
put up with my nonsense.

I have to thank anyone who 

read these articles and allowed 
me to give them secondhand 
embarrassment as I shared details 
of my life they probably didn’t want 
to know. Remember when I told 
everyone that I accidentally slept 
on some chocolate and it melted 
in my hair and I went to class like 
that anyway? Good times. Thanks 
for putting up with being forced to 
read that with your own two eyes.

I also have to thank the editors 

at the Daily for parsing through 
and publishing my improperly 
edited, regurgitated words.

And, perhaps most importantly, 

thank you to the people who 
(incidentally) 
allow 
me 
to 

eavesdrop 
and 
inhabit 
their 

world, even for just a moment; I’ve 
absorbed more of your secrets and 
wisdom than you’ll ever know.

P

resident Donald Trump’s 
second 
month 
in 

environmental policy has 

continued down a dangerous path. 
Policies that prioritized clean 
energy, environmental health and 
sustainable 
business 
practices 

during former President Barack 
Obama’s administration are being 
dismantled step by step.

On 
March 
24, 
Trump 

announced the granting of a 
permit for construction of the 
Keystone XL pipeline. Obama 
had stopped this construction 
in 
2015, 
acknowledging 
the 

pipeline would carry crude oil 
from tar sands, which requires 
a particularly energy-intensive 
process to extract and ultimately 
contributes to climate change. 
A 2015 study conducted by the 
Department of Energy found 
this extraction process emits 18 
percent more greenhouse gases 
than traditional U.S. crude oil 
when processed into gasoline. 

Additionally, 
the 
Trump 

administration’s promise of the 
pipeline’s job creation is deceptive. 
After the pipeline was projected 
to be completed in 2019, it was 
calculated that only 35 permanent 
employees and 15 temporary 
contractors 
will 
be 
needed 

to operate the pipeline. The 
disturbing neglect of scientific 
facts regarding climate change is 
predicted to continue as Trump 
has noted the pipeline will be 
“the first of many infrastructure 
projects” he plans to approve in an 
effort to create more jobs.

The construction of the Dakota 

Access Pipeline is also now well 
underway. Though a federal judge 
denied a motion brought by the 
Standing Rock and Cheyenne 
River Sioux tribes, who sought 
to prevent the flow of oil through 
DAPL, the $3.8 billion project 
has continued to face significant 
opposition. Chase Iron Eyes, the 
lead counsel of the Lakota People’s 
Law Project, acknowledged the 
motion, saying that “once again, 
the federal government and the 
Army are treating the original 
inhabitants of this land as though 
we are less than human, as though 
our lives and lands are something 
to be ignored and discarded in the 
never-ending quest for profit.”

While March 22 brought the 

annual celebration of World 
Water Day, there have already 
been 
numerous 
dramatic 

changes 
in 
water 
policy 

during the second month of 
the Trump administration. 

Trump has been planning a 

97 percent cut to the EPA’s Great 
Lakes 
Restoration 
Initiative 

funding, which has been central 
to over 3,000 projects tackling 
issues like wetland restoration, 
algae blooms in western Lake 
Erie, invasive Asian carp in the 
lakes and improving shoreline 
habitats. 
This 
initiative 
has 

spent over $2.2 billion since 
2010 on improving and restoring 
the Great Lakes. The proposed 
budget includes a 30 percent cut 
to EPA funding for state-level 
enforcement of the Clean Water 
Act, Clean Air Act and other 
federal environmental laws.

John Stine, a commissioner for 

the Minnesota Pollution Control 
Agency, says cuts to programs 
like the Great Lakes restoration 
project “would drive up the costs 
of water treatment, which in turn 
will be passed on to consumers.” 
U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D–Mich.) 
highlighted the flaw in Trump’s 
attempt to save money and 
generate jobs, explaining that the 
Great Lakes sustain 1.5 million 
jobs in the boating, fishing and 
tourism industries, bringing in 
billions of dollars each year. U.S. 
Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.), 
who represents Ann Arbor, added 
“(the Great Lakes) are vital for 
clean drinking water, jobs and 
our economy. This shortsighted 
attempt to zero out funding for the 
GLRI is unacceptable.”

Also of importance to Michigan 

residents, on March 17, three 
years after Flint River water 
started flowing into the city 
and beginning the water crisis, 
the 
Environmental 
Protection 

Agency awarded $100 million 
to the Michigan Department 
of Environmental Quality in a 
package signed off on by Obama 
in 2016. The funds will go toward 
making critical changes to Flint’s 
crumbling water infrastructure, 
specifically to contribute to the 
city’s goal of replacing 6,000 pipes 
by the end of 2017. Though this 
funding is a critical first step in 
Flint’s recovery process, it fails to 
provide an immediate solution to 
residents who do not have access 
to safe drinking water.

While Flint has benefited, the 

general pattern of budget cuts 
has extended beyond the EPA, 
as Trump announced his plan to 
cut 18.3 percent of the National 
Institutes 
of 
Health 
budget, 

accounting for a nearly $5.8 billion 
reduction. This cut is premised 
on reducing administrative costs. 
However, over 80 percent of the 
NIH’s current budget goes toward 

funding 
biomedical 
research 

projects, training programs and 
science centers. In 2016 alone, 
the NIH was able to award 
832 
research 
project 
grants. 

Additionally, the NIH partnered 
with the EPA to create five new 
research 
centers 
focused 
on 

improving health in communities 
that 
face 
health 
disparities 

brought about by pollution and 
other 
environmental 
factors. 

Funding to the NIH will be critical 
to continuing this groundbreaking 
research and supporting scientific 
advancement.

Trump’s attempts to create jobs 

by undermining environmental 
regulations 
continued 
as 
he 

signed the “Energy Independence 
Executive Order” on March 28. 
The order launched a review of 
Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a 
policy proposed by the EPA in 
2014 that puts a cap on the number 
of greenhouse gases that can be 
emitted from power plants. This 
executive order is predicted to 
have significant adverse effects 
on both the environment and 
the economy. A 2006 study by 
Nicholas Brown, the former chief 
economist at the World Bank, 
detailed 
that 
human-caused 

climate change could result in 
the “equivalent to losing at least 5 
percent of global GDP each year, 
now and forever.” Moreover, 
deregulating our existing climate 
policies will compromise our 
position and credibility as a global 
leader in climate change issues.

After 
another 
tumultuous 

month, 
funding 
for 
vital 

environmental 
protection 

programs 
and 
agencies 
has 

been threatened and cut, while 
plans for projects that threaten 
long-term environmental health 
are underway. In light of these 
changes, in a meeting with the 
University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, state Rep. Yousef 
Rabhi (D–Mich.) and former state 
Rep. Jeff Irwin highlighted that it 
will be essential to actively remain 
in contact with our local elected 
officials and educate ourselves 
about 
these 
environmental 

issues. 
This 
community-level 

involvement will be critical in the 
months ahead as we continue the 
fight to protect our planet and our 
quality of life.

Detroit doesn’t 
need University 

of Michigan 

students to save it; 

it’s saving itself.


When you live with 13 people, 

it gets a little hard to coordinate 
family-style dinners. You may 
have stopped reading after “13 
people.” Trust me, I understand. 
But it somehow works — and 
so can making a family style 
dinner big enough to feed the 
Von Trapp family on a budget.

Gathering with others for a 

meal is a deeply rooted tradition 
in our society and within my 
own experiences at school. For 
many reasons, which vary from 
table to table and group to group, 
a family-style dinner is one of 
the beloved and pure customs 
that bind us together. Ever 
heard of blue zones? Those are 
the few and ostensibly thriving 
locations in the world whose 
populations live to the age of 
150, because they eat almost all 
of their meals together (don’t 
fact check that). 

As graduation quickly and 

menacingly approaches (if you 
haven’t guessed from the tone 
of that statement, I’m nervous 
about it, but so is everyone, 
right?), the pressure is on to 
make the most of the time spent 
with friends, who will soon 
be fragmented by the reality 
of adult life (read: jobs, for 
many). With time, and likely 
discretionary income, running 
out, how does one take full 
advantage of this short period?

My answer to this inquiry, 

as with most things, is food 
of course. Though making a 
reservation for a large party 
at a great restaurant on a 
bustling Friday night can be 
enjoyable, it’s not as memorable 
as spending some extra quality 
time with friends cooking a 
meal together. And though 
that seems daunting (again, 
refer back to my current living 

situation), it can actually be a 
lot easier and cheaper than you 
may think.

Behold: the meal guide of all 

meal guides. Below, I’ve listed 
a few easy recipes inspired by 
a spur-of-the-moment family 
dinner I made with a few 
friends and some of my own 
hybrid recipes. So, if you’re 
either intrigued because you’d 
(A) rather be reading this than 
thinking about how another 
school year has raced by and 
graduation is imminent, or (B) 
you’re genuinely interested in 
this proposed guide to uniting 
with friends around a meal, 
then read on.

First, the pizza:

This one’s a no-brainer. Pizza 

is easy to make (if you buy the 
dough, but don’t tell anyone 
you bought it) and feeds a 
large group. Depending on the 
number of people partaking, 
two balls of dough should 
suffice for about 10 — and you 

can buy them at Trader Joe’s for 
under two dollars.

Full disclosure, this is maybe 

less of a recipe and more of a 
suggestion. Once you roll out 
the dough on a floured surface 
and transfer it to a greased (and 
I mean greased) parchment 
paper lined baking sheet, it’s 
basically a free-for-all.

While a simple marinara 

sauce (oil, garlic, and canned 
tomato sauce brought to a 
simmer) or the jarred variety 
can be used for a traditional 
pie, I’ve found that plenty 
of olive oil or a thin layer of 
heavy cream provide a good 
base for cheese and veggies. 
For the cheese, I like to use a 
mozzarella (fresh or shredded 
will work) and parmesan blend. 
After spreading a thin layer 
of sauce over your rolled out 
dough, 
sprinkle 
generously 

with cheese and top with your 
preferred variety of ingredients 
(I would suggest mushrooms, 
bacon and spinach).

Herbs — a hearty blend of 

oregano, fresh or dried basil, 
red chili flakes and salt and 
pepper — will elevate the 
pizza to restaurant-level. Pizza 
is typically a crowd pleaser 
and, unless you find yourself 
arguing with your friends over 
what toppings to use, they’re 
pretty fun to make. The dough 
package should contain baking 
instructions — otherwise, bake 
at 10-15 minutes (until the crust 

is slightly brown and the cheese 
is bubbling and golden on top) at 
about 500º.

Next, is the Sage and Brown 

Butter Pasta:

(Recipe adapted from The 

New York Times)

Pasta and butter are as cheap 

as cheap gets. They also happen 
to be delicious when combined 
using the following method. 
Before starting that tasty pizza, 
bring a large pot of salted water 
to a boil and cook a package (or 
two) of your desired noodles 
(I prefer rigatoni) just until 
almost al dente (not cooked 
all the way, so the pasta is still 
firm). While the pasta is boiling 
and the pizza is baking, begin to 
brown that butter. Throw in the 
sage and cook until the sage has 
shrunk and the butter is a deep 
golden brown.

Drain the pasta, reserving 

some of the pasta water to add to 
the sauce. Add the pasta to the 
butter and sage, increasing the 
heat to medium before adding 
the pasta water and stirring to 
combine. Add parmesan, salt 
and pepper, and that’s it! For a 
dairy-free version (we all have 
those friends), olive oil can be 
substituted. Heat the oil in a 
large skillet, add minced garlic 
and sage and the cooked pasta. 
Top with a squeeze of lemon 
and the parmesan.

Now, on to my favorite part — 

the garlic bread:

By now you may be thinking 

that this dinner is pretty carb-
heavy, and you’re not wrong. 
Bread, and other flour-based 
products are incredibly cheap 
and easy to prepare in large 
quantities for a big group of 
people. And there’s nothing 
wrong with that.

The preparation is simple. 

Heat butter and olive oil in the 
microwave until the butter 
has melted. Stir in about 1-1½ 
tablespoons of minced garlic 
(depending on the size of your 
loaf), salt and pepper, oregano 
and dried or fresh chopped 
parsley. Slice a baguette in half, 
spread the mixture over evenly 
and top with parmesan cheese. 
Bring the oven temperature 
down to 400º and bake until 
the cheese is bubbling and the 
edges of the bread turn golden 
brown (about 10 minutes).

And to break up the copious 

varieties of carbs in this meal, 
here’s a simple salad:

In a bowl, massage (yeah, I 

said massage) a large container 
of pre-washed baby kale with 
olive 
oil 
and 
lemon 
juice. 

Let rest for a few minutes 
before adding salt, pepper and 
parmesan cheese, tossing to 
combine.

‘Vice’ explores amateurism

HBO

When 
the 
NCAA 
was 

established 
over 
a 
century 

ago, its central mandate was 
to ensure to the sanctity of 
“amateurism” in the realm of 
college sports. The attitude 
remains stubbornly unchanged 
today. While the 
general philosophy 
of what upholds 
the 
NCAA’s 

existence 
is 

relatively laudable 
— on paper, non-
professionals 
being treated as 
professionals likely dampens 
the integrity of student athletics, 
sure — the general bone to pick 
regarding the organization’s 
operations lies in the fact that 
the social and cultural fabric of 
American sports has changed 
dramatically in the century 
since the NCAA came to being. 
College sports used to be an 
intramural outlet for American 
collegiate students looking to 
spend their free time somewhat 
productively. 
Recruitment 

wasn’t 
exactly 
a 
reality. 

Professional athletes made a 
pittance, 
oftentimes 
playing 

for teams started by factory 
workers that could barely stay 
afloat in the long-term. But the 
reality now? The NCAA rakes in 
absurd amounts of money, with 
its most recent broadcast deal 
with CBS Sports and Turner 
Broadcasting being penned at a 
valuation of $10.8 billion. Is this 
the same world of amateurism 
that 
the 
NCAA 
sought 
to 

regulate in 1906? It’s a point of 
contention for many, but none 
more so than the athletes, both 
former and current, that enable 
the NCAA to sign such deals.

College 
sports 
has 

transformed into a money-
making 
body 
that 
allows 

university 
football 
coaches 

to be the highest-paid state 
employees, while the athletes 
under 
their 
tutelage 
aren’t 

even allowed to see a dime. It’s 
a bizarre reality that “Vice” 

correspondent Gianna Toboni 
intimately and comprehensively 
explores in recent episode, 
“The 
End 
of 
Amateurism.” 

Talking both to a variety of 
former athletes who have been 
calling for institutional justice, 
and current collegiate athletic 
directors (many of whom are 
vehemently in support of the 
status quo), Toboni constructs 

a laudable and 
steady-handed 
look at a subject 
of debate that is 
(more often than 
not) painted as 
being far simpler 
than reality.

Titled 
“The 

End 
of 
Amateurism,” 
the 

episode openly notes that the 
end isn’t particularly nigh. 
Rather, a lot of the episode’s 
focus lies on the fight to bring 
upon that end — the rhetoric, 
its pitfalls and the struggle’s 
main protagonists — largely 
former athletes who have been 
wronged and forgotten by the 
system that promised them 
a share of their own spoils. 
The episode also comes at a 
pointedly opportune time, with 
March Madness having just 
concluded and the NFL Draft 
just on our horizons — sports 
are fresh on the mind of the 
American psyche, so it’s only 
fair for “Vice” and HBO to 
strike when most effective.

While many of the viewers 

this episode may have appealed 
to probably have a fair handle 
on the fundamentals of the 
amateurism debate, rarely are 
audiences afforded as intimate 
of a look into the issue as 
“Vice” provides here. One of 
the most sobering moments of 
the episode comes on the heels 
of Toboni following former 
Auburn running back Peyton 
Barber alongside his draft day 
travails. Projected to be a sixth-
round pick in the draft, viewers 
watch as Barber agonizingly 
waits until the draft concludes, 
with no team having called his 
name. Barber left Auburn as a 
sophomore due to the possible 
financial incentives he could 

offer his family — a common 
gamble 
by 
many 
college 

athletes who see it as the only 
bonafide route toward a better 
life for themselves and their 
kin. But as said, such a move 
is still a gamble, and, as seen 
through the eyes of Barber, a 
rather sad one at that. “No one 
ever considered he wouldn’t 

get drafted,” remarks Toboni. 
That much is clear to Barber 
and 
his 
immediate 
family. 

Earlier on, Barber notes that 
he probably wouldn’t have left 
Auburn so early had he seen 
some form of compensation as 
a student athlete. Now he is in 
a situation far more tenuous 
that he could’ve expected — and 
he hopes that doesn’t remain a 
reality for athletes that come 
after him.

For a topic touted so often 

in the public sphere, “Vice” 
and its sobering, constructive 
take on the issue seems to 
be a rare example of what 
public discourse regarding the 
amateurism debate should look 
like. Student athletes have a 
tenuous journey ahead of them, 
that much we know. Never 
letting 
the 
spotlight 
waver 

on their issues will do them 
more good than venerating 
their athletic successes. “Vice” 
ensures we don’t forget that.

AVINADAV

The quick and dirty guide 
to a family (friend) dinner

FOOD COLUMN

“The Last Word” is written 

in such a way that’s it is almost 
certain first-time screenwriter 
Stuart Ross Fink knew a version 
of Shirley MacLaine’s (“Bernie”) 
Harriet Lauler in real life. Only 
that would explain his script’s 
blind lionization of a deeply flawed 
character and implicit accusations 
that anyone who sides against her 
“just doesn’t get it.” In his haste to 
paint a picture of this seemingly 
perfect woman, he forgot to make 
good on a premise with some 
charm and instead focused his 
energy on characters that never 
once rise above boring and drama 
that 
somehow 
continuously 

outdoes its own one-notedness. 
Its 
talented 
performers 
are 

completely stranded in some of 
the most predictable, trite baloney 
to hit the silver screen this year.

The story involves Harriet 

Lauler, an elderly woman who 
wants a say in how her obituary 
is written and hires the local obit 
writer (Amanda Seyfried, “Pan”) 
to ensure a suitable job is done 
before her death. There’s some 
promise to this story, particularly 
in its originality and potential for 
dark comedy, and 
initially it appears 
it will make good 
on 
that 
promise. 

An early montage 
of people, including 
a 
spiteful 
priest, 

saying nothing but 
negative 
things 

about 
Lauler 
is 

genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, 
and MacLaine play Lauler with 
the wit and nuance her character 
needs.

MacLaine is hands-down the 

best part of the movie, but she 
can only hold a script like this 
afloat by will alone for so long, 
especially when her character 
is the flick’s biggest problem. 

Lauler is portrayed as an overly 
controlling force of nature who 
makes life miserable for everyone 
around her. You would think that 
this character arc writes itself. 
You would be wrong. Instead, 
Fink decides that it isn’t Lauler 
that is the problem; it’s everyone 

else. 
She’s 
only 

controlling 
because 
she’s 

perfect 
and 

knows 
better 

than 
everyone 

else 
how 
they 

should live their 
lives. 
Everyone 

who 
complains? 

They just don’t understand that 
she’s “trying to help them reach 
their full potential.” She’s like the 
end-all-be-all, the perfect human 
specimen, a god with a drinking 
problem.

And none of this makes for good 

drama. When the main character 
of a film is so overwhelmingly 
flawless 
and 
only 
nominally 

human, it becomes impossible to 
relate to anything that’s going on. 
The brunt of the burden falls on the 
supporting cast, which crumbles 
as well. Seyfried co-headlines 
as the obituary writer Lauler 
hires, and the actress quickly 
finds herself in a role that forces 
her to be completely passive, lest 
she accidentally share or even 
– Heaven forbid – steal Lauler’s 
spotlight. She is relegated to be yet 
another one of the older woman’s 
pet projects and friend, despite 
an entirely one-sided dynamic. 

AnnJewel Lee Dixon, in her 
onscreen debut, rounds out the 
main trio in a role that forces her 
to take on a bevy of problematic 
stereotypes. With that in mind, 
the weakness of the resulting 
performance is more forgivable.

If Lucille Bluth from “Arrested 

Development” was given a feature 
film and the writers didn’t just 
ignore that she’s a fundamentally 
domineering, 
narcissistic 

alcoholic of a character but 
actively glorified those qualities 
while stripping her of most of the 

wit that made her funny, it would 
look something like “The Last 
Word.” No drama can arise from 
such 
monotonous 
characters, 

yet the audience is continually 
asked to root for them even when 
anyone who has seen any movie 
in the last hundred years can 
guess exactly where this one is 
going from the first ten minutes. 
Without anything to relate to, 
“The Last Word” may not be a bad 
movie, but it is a dreadfully boring 
one that lacks the humanity for 
which it strives.

‘Discovery’ looks at death

Released 
on 
Netflix, 

romantic science fiction film 
“The 
Discovery” 
reveals 

scientific proof of life after 
death. But the real discovery 
is yet to come. When mass 
suicide phenomena erupts to 
“get 
there,” 
the 

meaning of death 
evolves. 
“The 

Discovery” eagerly 
trips over itself to 
preach on how.

In 
his 
only 

public 
interview, 

Dr. Harbor (Robert Redford, 
“All The President’s Men”), 
the neurologist who made the 
breakthrough, is asked whether 
he feels responsible for the 
thousands of suicides:“No” His 
face remains stoic.

“That’s it?”
“That’s it.”
That’s not it. The interview 

results in an on-air suicide 
by a crew member, and Dr. 
Harbor retreats into sudden 
and 
mysterious 
seclusion. 

Two years later, his son, Will 
(Jason Segel, “How I Met 
Your Mother), visits him in a 
repurposed mansion on an off-
peak tourist island. Devotees in 
prison jumpsuits meditate in its 
dreary halls, and in operating 
rooms under passcode security, 
they die and shock themselves 
back to life to “reset the brain.”

To Will’s dismay, his father 

unveils a new device that he 
claims will record what the 

brain sees during the brief 
minute of death, and allow 
those curious to see what, 
really, is in the afterlife. A 
budding romance between Will 
and Isla (Rooney Mara, “The 
Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”), 
a girl he met on the island, leads 
to Will questioning how their 
relationship fits against the 
backdrop of life, death and the 
discovery.

“The 

Discovery” 
raises 
interesting 
questions about 
bioethics 
and 

metaphysics, 
but 
the 
film 

exists 
purely 
as 
a 
means 

to 
that 
end, 
prioritizing 

philosophical 
musing 
over 

character development. While 
it 
successfully 
mobilizes 

serious thought in an accessible 
way, 
it 
does 
so 
through 

monologues about the meaning 
of life artificially inserted into 
dialogue. Within minutes of 
Will and Isla’s first meeting, the 
pair is already opining about 
the afterlife. With inherently 
unnatural-sounding 
lines, 

their delivery comes across 
as stiff, dissolving thematic 
development into tedium. Even 
as their romance progresses, 
they are defined more by their 
circumstances than by who 
they are.

The plot twist at the end 

sheds some clarity on why 
that is, but isn’t remarkable 
enough to overcome the lack of 
characterization 
throughout. 

Most times, the script seems 

exceedingly pleased with its 
own intelligence, and tries its 
hardest to create opportunities 
to hear itself spoken aloud.

Still, the actors do their 

best 
to 
personalize 
their 

lines. One of the few realistic-
sounding discussions is when 
a 
supporting 
actor 
(Riley 

Keough, “American Honey”) 
talks about how it may be 
easier to justify murder. She 
sounds irritated, mentions the 
comment off-hand in between 
slips of another conversation 
— the idea of death has been 
normalized.

Also, the tightly stylized 

creative elements help add 
dynamism. 
The 
cool-toned 

color palette moodily matches 
its subject matter, setting up 
gorgeous 
contrasts 
between 

dreary shadows and glowing 
light. 
The 
cinematography, 

adds a humanizing dimension, 
taking special care to highlight 
movement through the screen 
in way the script fails to do. 
The mansion’s design, which 
nixes glossy futurism typical 
in science fiction in favor of 
clunky, homegrown machinery, 
feels believable and unique.

With a talented cast and 

crew, “The Discovery” had 
potential to be more compelling 
than it was. But instead of 
setting 
its 
philosophical 

dilemma as a foundation to 
build upon, the film did the 
opposite, creating an elaborate 
plot just to prop up one lucky 
writer’s conjectures. It feels 
hollow, and the audience never 
gets the chance to connect with 
its characters.

‘Poets at Michigan’: A 
reflective look at MI poets

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Poetry has played an integral 

role in literature and the arts 
for 
generations. 
From 
epic 

poetry to contemporary poetry, 
it has simultaneously reflected 
and created culture.

At the University itself, poets 

have had a far-
reaching influence, 
impacting 
students, 
faculty 
and 
the 

community. 
To 
showcase 

these 
poets 
and 

their works, the 
Department 
of 

English Language 
and 
Literature 

will 
present 
the 

symposium “Poets 
at Michigan, Then and Now.”

This symposium is a part 

of the University of Michigan 
Bicentennial 
celebration, 
a 

celebration that also includes 
events like Stumbling Blocks, 
themed classes, Spring Festival 
and more. The event is comprised 
of three panels that are split up 
based on the time period.

“It’s going to cover the 

range of poets at Michigan,” 
said Cody Walker, professor 
of English and director of the 
Creative Writing minor. “We 
are looking at poets who taught 
here or were students here — 
sometimes both — and we begin 
with Robert Frost.”

The 
morning 
panel 
will 

cover 
Robert 
Frost, 
the 

Hopwood 
Awards 
and 
the 

History of Poetry at Michigan. 
Frost played an active role as 

a professor at the University, 
hosting many readings and 
engaging 
with 
Ann 
Arbor 

residents through his work. 
Archival 
research, 
edited 

letters and other information 
on Frost will be presented. This 
panel also includes the History 
of Poetry at Michigan and the 
Hopwood Awards, which are 
contests and prizes granted 

to students for 
their 
writing, 

established 
in 

1931.

The 
next 

panel is titled 
“The 
Middle 

Years,” covering 
Robert Hayden, 
Theodore 
Roethke, Donald 
Hall, 
Jane 

Kenyon 
and 

more. Similar to 

the first panel, it will present 
a mix of research and work by 
the poets.

The final panel, titled “The 

Art Continues: Contemporary 
Michigan Poets,” will mostly 
include readings performed by 
current faculty or graduated 
MFA students. Through this 
structure of the symposium, 
each panel will highlight the 
changes in poetry through 
the 
years, 
showcasing 
the 

development of this art form 
through time at Michigan.

Keith Taylor, undergraduate 

creative writing coordinator, 
professor of English Laurence 
Goldstein, alum Paul Diamond 
and Walker are the creators 
of the event. Goldstein came 
up with the idea behind the 
celebration, 
and 
Walker 

became involved because he 

teaches a class titled “Michigan 
Poets, Then and Now.” The 
symposium will loosely follow 
the structure of Walker’s class.

“I 
hope 
that 
this 
is 

something that people will 
really remember as important … 
that it stays with them,” Walker 
said.

Walker acknowledged that 

many of the poets — like Frost 
and W.H. Auden — who either 
were students or taught at 
Michigan may not be widely 
associated with the campus 
community. This event could 
help draw attention toward 
Michigan’s history of poets, 
therefore acknowledging both 
the poets and the University 
itself.

“Frost was a presence on 

campus, and he helped to 
establish the idea that having 
a poet on campus might be 
a valuable thing, besides for 
teaching,” Walker said.

Walker 
also 
noted 
that 

several 
of 
the 
professors 

involved with the symposium 
are retiring after this year, 
have retired recently or will 
retire soon, including Nicholas 
Delbanco, 
Goldstein 
and 

Taylor. While the retirement 
of these professors is not the 
main focus of the symposium, 
Walker believes it is significant 
for them as well. The event 
serves not only as a public 
act for them, but as an act of 
commemoration.

“These people have been 

here for decades and decades 
and decades, and they are 
the institutional memories of 
this place,” Walker said. “The 
conference gets to celebrate 
them as these fonts of wisdom.”

Jukebox the Ghost to bring 
their passion to the Pig 

“We’ve always been willing 

to do anything to get our 
music heard or jump on an 
opportunity,” 
wrote 
Ben 

Thornewill, the vocalist and 
pianist 
for 
indie-pop 
band 

Jukebox 
the 

Ghost, in an email 
interview.

Embodying 

the trio’s fervent 
restlessness, 
Jukebox the Ghost 
never 
cease 
to 

chase possibilities. 
They’ve 
been 

hopping 
from 

gig to gig for the 
past 
10 
years, 

constantly working to sharpen, 
develop and spread their sound.

“We played on the David 

Letterman show some years 
ago now – but we got the call 
to be on the show at 10 p.m. 
the night before. I was living 
in Philly and the other guys 
were in NY — but the van was 
in NY and the instruments in 
Philly. Tommy and Jesse drove 
down, we loaded the van, drove 
through the night to get back 
to NYC, slept for two hours 
and then rushed to the studio,” 
Thornewill wrote, summing up 
their attitude as a band.

Other members are Tommy 

Siegel (guitar, vocals) and Jesse 
Kristin 
(drums, 
vocals) 
–– 

together the group has played 
almost 1,000 shows together, 
slowly creeping their way up 
the power-pop landscape and 
collecting an ardently loyal fan 
base.

“We 
started 
playing 

together in college (at George 
Washington 
University) 
— 

Jesse (the drummer) and I lived 
next door to each other in the 
dorms, and we met Tommy 
through a flyer he put up in the 
music department,” Thornewill 
wrote. “It started out as us 

playing in basements and frat 
houses and somehow now we 
are still a band. The world is a 
mysterious place.”

Easy 
on 
the 
eyes 
and 

outrageously 
passionate, 

Jukebox the Ghost has been 
riding their dream for quite the 
hot minute, managing to inject 
the same dynamism into their 
performances now as they did 

10 years ago.

“It’s all about 

the audience for 
me — playing for 
new people gives 
an energy and 
life to the songs,” 
Thornewill 
wrote 
about 

their 
concerts. 

“Hollywood 
is one of my 
absolute 

favorites (to perform live) — 
Jesse comes out from behind 
the drum set and for a moment 
embodies a classic crooner.”

The trio screams vitality, 

constantly touring because they 
love it and they’re ridiculously 
good at it. They’re like your 
older brothers, best friends and 
the nonchalant dudes who jam 
across the street — unabashedly 
fun, yet the kind of cool you 
always hoped to be. They’re so 
eager to continue exploring the 
world of music that you can’t 
help but groove through it with 
them. With nowhere to go and 
everywhere to be, their vigor 
for life is so pure it’s almost 
tangible.

Despite 
being 
danceable 

as hell, Jukebox the Ghost’s 
music avoids falling into the 
nonsensical trap of lyrics that 
pop 
music 
is 
occasionally 

victim to.

“It varies,” Thornewill wrote 

when talking about the group’s 
creativity. “Sometimes it’s a 
good book, a new song, bad 
TV, relationships … Inspiration 
can come from anywhere if you 
keep your eyes open.”

With endless muses, their 

songs are about irresistibly 

normal human triumphs, losses 
and fates. They’ve got oomph.

Their 
latest 
record, 
the 

self-titled Jukebox the Ghost, 
encompasses the progressive 
fruition of the band. The 23 
tracks hold true to their pop 
background yet venture into 
the realms of jazz and hip hop. 
Including a solo piano version 
of each song, the album is 
reflective of the experiences, 
nuances and distinctions the 
group has accumulated over 
their time together.

“We are currently working 

on our fifth studio album,” 
Thornewill said. “I think when 
music is your life, it constantly 
evolves. The evolution is a 
byproduct of years on the 
road, getting older, growing 
increasingly senile and falling 

in and out of love with the 
sound of a cowbell.” 

Continuing 
their 
voyage 

through pop, the group is 
rearing to experience fresh 
territories with their audiences. 
Fans can expect to party their 
hearts out and newbies should 
anticipate bopping around to 
their tunes long after the night 
fades.

Playing some new songs and 

keeping on with their easygoing 
power-pop gusto, Jukebox the 
Ghost is set to take the stage at 
the Blind Pig next Friday.

Speight and Hamilton quickly develop working relationship

The first time Pep Hamilton 

ever saw Wilton Speight, it 
had nothing to do with the 
Michigan football team.

Speight wasn’t the starting 

quarterback for the Wolverines 
yet. In this case, he was just a 
high school lacrosse player.

Hamilton, then at Stanford, 

had made his way down to 
Richmond, Va., to watch the 
lacrosse game of a defensive 
end he was recruiting. Speight 
just happened to catch his eye 
as a player who was “extremely 
quick and athletic for his size” 
on the lacrosse field.

Hamilton later found out 

who the “scrawny” 6-foot-5 kid 
really was: Collegiate School’s 
starting quarterback who was 
supposedly heading to North 
Carolina State to play football, 
and that was the full extent of 
the interaction back then.

Lo 
and 
behold, 
Speight 

never played for the Wolfpack, 
despite holding a childhood 
affinity for them. He ended up 
in Ann Arbor. So did Hamilton, 
many years later.

And it didn’t take long for 

Michigan’s 
new 
associate 

head coach and passing game 
coordinator 
to 
realize 
the 

connection he had with his new 
pupil.

“I knew as soon as I decided 

to be a part of coach Harbaugh’s 
program who I was going to 
have an opportunity to work 
with,” 
Hamilton 
explained 

Tuesday.

The two have built what 

appears to be a solid working 
relationship through the early 
part of spring practices. Both, 
as Hamilton relayed, have a 
good understanding of what his 
job is, which is to help Speight 
become the best quarterback he 
can be.

That has clearly resonated 

with the redshirt junior as 
he 
enters 
his 
first 
spring 

entrenched 
as 
Michigan’s 

quarterback. For once, there 
is some comfortability in his 
position 
— 
though 
Speight 

and Hamilton have said the 
customary 
things 
about 

fending 
off 

internal 
competition 
— 
and 
that 

has 
allowed 

Speight to set 
his 
eyes 
on 

further goals.

He 
doesn’t 

want 
to 
be 

just the best 
quarterback on 
the team. Now, 
he wants to be the best in the 
entire conference.

“It’s always, ‘OK, if I can 

check this off, then it’s (the) 
next (box),’ ” Speight said. “It’s 

not, ‘OK, let me sit in this little 
checked-out box for as long as 
I can and be comfortable.’ It’s 
‘OK, I need to keep achieving 

every little goal 
that I have on my 
list.’

“Obviously, I’m 

still doing my best 
to make sure that 
box 
is 
checked 

off and I’m the 
quarterback here, 
but at the same 
time, I’m trying 
to check that next 
box off.”

How 
he’ll 

achieve 
that 

next step will surely involve 
the 
tutelage 
of 
Hamilton, 

who replaces former assistant 
Jedd Fisch — a coach Speight 
described as being “on the same 

page all the time” with.

Despite any unfamiliarity, 

the new mentor and mentee 
jumped into things from the 
very 
moment 

they 
met 
in 

person. Speight 
recalls 
shaking 

Hamilton’s 
hand 
before 

immediately 
heading 
to 
a 

whiteboard 
together, where 
Hamilton 
quizzed him on 
his 
decision-

making 
versus 
certain 

defensive looks.

“His big thing was we’ll get 

to know each other as time 
goes on, we’ll build a good 
relationship, but right now it’s 

about football,” Speight said. 
“That’s what I love — a working 
relationship first.”

Hamilton had a lot of praise 

for what his new 
quarterback 
brought 
to 

the 
table 

performance-
wise 
— 

especially from 
what 
he 
saw 

watching 
last 

year’s tape.

“I 
thought 

that 
(Speight) 

had 
above-

average physical 
stature for the 

position,” Hamilton said. “He 
can function from the pocket, 
he has great field vision and 
he can deliver the ball under 
duress. And I felt like that was 

an extreme positive.”

Speight’s 
mental 
grasp 

of the game, especially as 
Hamilton adds new concepts 
and terminology to the pre-
existing offensive scheme, has 
impressed the coach as well.

“Wilton 
is 
a 
conceptual 

learner, and so some of the 
things that we’ve put on his 
plate up until this point in the 
spring, he was a quick study,” 
Hamilton said. “... It’s preferred 
that 
you 
have 
guys 
that 

understand the why, that get it 
the first time. I think it helps 
them to ultimately be good 
decision-makers post-snap, and 
that’s something that you see in 
Wilton when you watch him.

“You just go back and watch 

his film. He can manage bad 
plays, and he does a good job of 
playing situational football.”

While Hamilton and Speight 

have hit the ground running 
on the field, there doesn’t 
appear to be much of a personal 
relationship. 
Hamilton 
even 

said he didn’t know that he 
would label what the two have 
as a relationship yet.

That won’t be an issue as 

Hamilton seeks to build the 
offense 
around 
Speight’s 

strengths. His new pupil has 
the keys to the Ferrari, and 
their utmost concern is making 
sure Speight knows just how to 
handle that responsibility while 
continuing to elevate his game.

But it wouldn’t be a surprise 

if the two became even closer as 
they continue to work alongside 
each other. After all, they have 
the most important thing in 
common — they want to win.

“I think once we finish spring 

ball and maybe while we’re 
over in Europe, we’ll have a 
chance to actually sit down and 
get to know each other better,” 
Hamilton said. “A lot of our 
time is spent just grinding on 
football right now, and thank 
goodness Wilton is mature 
enough to manage all his affairs 
very well off the field. It’s been 
all ball, all the time.”

Redshirt junior quarterback Wilton Speight and associate head coach Pep Hamilton have emphasized a football-first focus to their relationship in the early going.

“I’m trying to 
check off that 

next box.”

“It’s been all 
ball, all the 

time.”

Wolverines ready for
clash with Buckeyes 

It will be strength against 

strength when the No. 18 
Michigan softball team (6-0 
Big Ten, 26-7-1 overall) visits 
No. 25 Ohio State (6-0, 27-7) 
this weekend.

The Wolverines’ top-ranked 

pitching 
rotation, 
which 

hasn’t surrendered a run in 
Big Ten play thus far, will 
face a Buckeye offense that 
hits .444 and averages over 
11 runs per game — good for 
the conference lead in both 
categories.

Ohio State’s run production 

was 
apparent 

against 
Rutgers 
last 

weekend, 
as 

it 
outscored 

its 
opponent, 

32-3, 
in 
a 

brisk 
sweep. 

The Buckeyes 
also 
notched 

three victories 
against 
Maryland 
to 
open 

conference 
play 
in 
late 

March.

Sophomore 
Lilli 
Piper, 

who hits .443 with nine home 
runs and 38 RBI, leads Ohio 
State offensively. She 
will 

undoubtedly be the toughest 
matchup both senior right-
hander Megan Betsa and junior 
right-hander Tera Blanco have 
faced in the last month.

But it’s not a one-woman 

show for the Buckeyes. Seven 
players are hitting over the 
.300 mark, including junior 
Taylor White, who has hit 
seven home runs in 2017.

“You look at Taylor White — 

she’s a player,” Hutchins said. 
“They hit very well.”

In the circle, Ohio State 

right-handers Shelby Hurst 
(1.79 earned-run average) and 
Lena Miller (2.08) are talented 
starters who can capitalize on 

Michigan’s struggles against 
effective pitching.

When 
facing 
pitchers 

with an ERA under 2.00, the 
Wolverines are averaging just 
1.625 runs per game and have 
been shut out three times. 
That shortcoming proves to be 
the culprit behind Michigan’s 
lackluster 2-6-1 record against 
ranked opponents this season.

If 
that 
trend 
is 
any 

indication, 
the 
Buckeyes’ 

ranking isn’t promising for the 
Wolverines.

Then 
again, 
Michigan’s 

offense has excelled recently, 
averaging eight runs per game 
in Big Ten play. Sophomore

After rain and snow hit the 

Columbus area this week, a 
doubleheader is now scheduled 
for Saturday with the series 
concluding Sunday afternoon.

With six days in between 

games, Hutchins will put an 
emphasis on “playing live” in 
Friday’s practice, scrimmaging 
for an abbreviated session. By 
doing so, she hopes to prepare 
the Wolverines to add to their 
12-game winning streak.

But 
Hutchins 
is 
still 

very aware of Ohio State’s 
capabilities.

“They’re a talented team,” 

Hutchins 
said. 
“They’re 
a 

balanced team, hit for power, 
and pitch well. We have our 
hands full.”

‘M’ riding seven-game win streak into Illinois

The No. 18 Michigan baseball 

team’s scheduled game against 
Bowling Green was cancelled 
Wednesday after just half an 
inning due to rain. That has been 
just about the only thing capable of 
putting out the Wolverines’ fire the 
last two weeks.

Michigan’s bats took off against 

Toledo, Central Michigan and 
Penn State last week as its offense 
drove in 64 runs, while the 
pitching staff was as dominant, 
allowing just 13. And after five 
straight routs, the Wolverines 
showed they still have what it 
takes to win close battles, rallying 
from a three-run deficit to defeat 
Notre Dame on Tuesday.

Michigan (4-2 Big Ten, 23-6 

overall) will look to extend its 
seven-game winning streak at 
home against Illinois (0-3, 10-16) 
this weekend. While the Fighting 
Illini are experiencing somewhat of 
a down year, they have historically 
been one of the Big Ten’s stronger 
teams. During coach Dan Hartleb’s 
11-year tenure, Illinois has won two 
conference titles, in 2011 and 2015, 

and has finished lower than sixth 
just twice. 

Illinois’ season so far has been 

heavily influenced by the long 
ball. Despite ranking in the middle 
of the Big Ten in most offensive 
statistics, the Fighting Illini lead the 
conference with 30 home runs. But 
Illinois ranks last in terms of giving 
up homers, having surrendered 40 
this season.

With Michigan’s offense the 

most productive as it’s been this 
season, it has a perfect opportunity 
to keep its momentum going 
against the Fighting Illini. The 
Wolverines rank third or higher 
in the Big Ten in every offensive 
category aside from home runs, and 
lead in on-base percentage (.396) 
and stolen bases (67).

Junior third baseman Drew 

Lugbauer, who bats .286 with eight 
home runs and 34 runs batted in, 
is Michigan’s main power threat. 
But the entire lineup has been 
impactful as of late. Sophomore 
right fielder Jonathan Engelmann 
has hit .700 over his last six games 
to vault from ninth to first on the 
team in batting average, while 
sophomore designated hitter Nick 
Poirier – who normally bats one 

spot ahead of Engelmann – has put 
up a .556 clip of his own.

Two 
Wolverines 
possess 

impressive streaks they will look 
to continue against Illinois. Senior 
shortstop Michael Brdar is riding 
a 15-game hitting streak into the 
weekend, while sophomore second 
baseman Ako Thomas has reached 
base in every game this season.

The Fighting Illini possess 

a young lineup, with only one 
upperclassmen 
among 
their 

top 
seven 
hitters. 
That 
one 

upperclassmen, however, is senior 
first baseman Pat McInerney – 
the Big Ten leader in slugging 
percentage (.727) and home runs 
(11).

But McInerney doesn’t do it 

alone. Outfielder Jack Yalowitz has 
boosted his batting average from 
.227 his freshman year to .355 this 
season, and forms a formidable 
middle-of-the-order 
duo 
with 

McInerney. Casey Dodge and 
Michael Massey also contribute 
with solid batting averages of .299 
and .291, respectively.

Illinois’ 
pitching 
staff 
is 

equally youthful, and has shown 
its inexperience this season – its 
team earned-run-average of 6.20 

is ahead of only Rutgers in the 
Big Ten. However, freshman Ty 
Weber gives the Fighting Illini 
hope. In seven starts this season, 
he has compiled a 3.80 ERA and 
has held opponents to a .210 
batting average. 

While McInerney and Yalowitz 

are two of the Big Ten’s best hitters, 
they’ll have their work cut out for 
them against Michigan’s pitching 
staff.

Junior left-hander Oliver Jaskie 

(4-1) is coming off a career-high 
12 strikeouts against Penn State 
and leads the conference in that 
category, while juniors Ryan Nutof 
and Michael Hendrickson round 
out the starting rotation, coming 
off quality outings of their own 
last week. And when it comes time 
to shut the door, the Wolverines 
know they can turn to senior closer 
Jackson Lamb, who has saved 
seven games and has yet to allow an 
earned run this season.

Illinois does boast its fair share of 

talent, but with the way Michigan 
has been playing lately, and barring 
more 
inclement 
weather, 
the 

Wolverines appear to be in a good 
position to extend their winning 
streak this weekend.

For Wolverines, three voices form one vision

Every year, Carol Hutchins’ 

phone rings.

It’s the athletic department of yet 

another college, and they want to 
offer associate head coach Bonnie 
Tholl and assistant coach Jennifer 
Brundage head coaching positions.

And every year, these programs 

receive the same answer.

The assistants always turn the 

offers down. 

When 
asked 
why 
this 
is, 

Hutchins doesn’t need a second to 
hesitate.

She provides a simple, yet 

authentic, answer.

“I think they bleed blue.”

***

When Tholl graduated from 

Michigan in 1991, she had already 
made a name for herself in the 
softball sphere.

As Hutchins put it:
“She was one of those kids who 

was kind of a program changer.”

And that wasn’t an exaggeration. 

Tholl — a four-year starter at 
shortstop for the Wolverines from 
1988 to 1991 — made history when 
she became the first player to net 
All-Big Ten First Team honors four 
times.

During her tenure as a player, 

Tholl was a captain, a record-setter 
and a role model. She could have 
left Michigan after her senior year 
knowing she had already made 
her mark, but she and Hutchins 
both knew she wanted more. They 
both knew she was meant to be a 
Michigan coach.

“I think when you leave a place 

that’s so special to you, you kind of 
compare any other place you go to 
the place that was special,” Tholl 
said. “My vision and my thought 
process was that someday, I wanted 
to come back to Michigan.”

After working for two years as 

an assistant coach of Indiana while 
simultaneously obtaining a master’s 
degree in athletic administration, 
Tholl had the chance to return 
to Ann Arbor much sooner than 
she had anticipated. The current 
assistant coach for the Wolverines 
could only work part time, but 
Hutchins was doing a majority of 
the heavy lifting by herself and 
needed more experienced hands on 
deck. Tholl was the clear woman for 
the job.

She returned to Ann Arbor for 

the 1994 season, diving into her 
second assistant coaching role just 
three years out of college. She found 
herself in uncharted territory, 
working side by side with Hutchins 
for the first time, instead of playing 
for her.

It’s been 24 years, and Tholl has 

never looked back.

***

Hutchins still remembers the 

first time she saw Brundage play 
softball up close. It was in a 1995 
game 
between 
Michigan 
and 

UCLA, one of the best softball 
programs at the time.

When the game ended, though, 

the Wolverines were triumphant, 
proving themselves worthy of 
competing 
with 
the 
big-name 

teams. Despite the end result, 
Hutchins found herself intrigued 
by one Bruins player: Jennifer 
Brundage.

“I just remember, I’m on third 

base (as coach) and Jenn’s the 
third baseman,” Hutchins said. 
“And I admired her game and her 
style.”

Brundage, a senior during that 

game, batted .518 on the season, 
above any other NCAA Division I 

player that year. That season, she 
broke the UCLA records for home 
runs, runs batted-in and doubles. 
After coaching as an assistant at 
Tennessee-Chattanooga for a year, 
she went back to UCLA for the 1997 
season, having been offered the 
assistant coaching spot. 

At this time, Kelly Kovach 

Schoenly, now the head coach at 
Ohio State, worked as Hutchins’ 
pitching 
coach. 
But 
in 
1998, 

Schoenly had been offered a position 
at Penn State, a job that would be 
both an upward move for her and 
closer to her home in Pennsylvania. 
Hutchins needed a new pitching 
coach, and she thought of Brundage.

Having started in the circle just 

five times for UCLA, she may have 
seemed like an unusual choice at 
first glance. But Hutchins had done 
her research. 

“(UCLA) was the only school 

that didn’t recruit (Brundage) to 
pitch,” Hutchins said. “If she’d have 
played at Ohio State, she would have 
been a pitcher, and so I knew, when 
the job opened up, that she had an 
extensive pitching background.”

In her interview, Brundage 

convinced Hutchins that she could 
take the pitching program and run 

with it. Brundage was hired as an 
assistant coach for the 1999 season, 
joining a team that Hutchins 
and Tholl had already brought to 
four-straight 
Women’s 
College 

World Series appearances. It was 
this season that the foundation of 
Michigan softball, as it is known 
today, came together. And 19 
seasons later, the core still hasn’t 
left.

***

When the trio began working 

together, a few questions remained 
about how the dynamic would 
shape out. For the first time, Tholl 
began taking on many duties, 
spearheading 
the 
program’s 

recruiting efforts and coaching the 
outfield. How would she handle 
these newfound responsibilities? 
And 
while 
Hutchins 
knew 

Brundage could pitch, there was 
still the question of how she would 
bode supervising the position as the 
primary pitching coach.

The coaching staff had to 

overcome 
these 
hurdles, 
but 

with a little bit of time, they 
metamorphosed into a cohesive 
unit.

“When I was here my first couple 

years, I wasn’t mature enough 
to make all the decisions I make 
today,” Tholl said. “And I think 
under Hutch’s tutelage, I’m now a 
product of all of her teaching.”

One thing that didn’t take time, 

though, was for each coach to 
bring their unique knowledge and 
experiences to the table, something 
that proved vital to building the elite 
program that stands today.

Hutchins 
brought 
expertise. 

When Brundage joined the program 
in 1999, Hutchins had already been 
Michigan’s head coach for 14 years. 
Just a year later, she notched her 
638th victory, putting her in first 
place for all-time wins among 
Wolverine coaches. With upward of 
1,500 wins today, she is the NCAA’s 
winningest softball coach of all time 
and arguably the greatest coach in 
the history of the sport.

Brundage 
brought 
a 
rare 

combination of skilled pitching and 
slugging knowledge. In her tenure 
at Michigan, she has helped in the 
batter’s box while also coaching 
nine players to Big Ten Pitcher of 
the Year honors. And Hutchins was 
quick to note that no school has had 
more All-Americans in the circle 
than Michigan since Brundage 
joined the staff.

Tholl brought creativity to the 

team with defensive coaching, 
mainly in the outfield, and an 
aptitude for recruitment. Right 
off the bat, in her first recruiting 
class, she found Sara Griffin and 
Kellyn Tate, the class that propelled 
Michigan into its first WCWS in 
1995. Tholl’s hard work and skill led 
to a promotion for the 2003 season 
to associate head coach.

“She has an even better mind 

for the game than I do, and she 
has a better recruiting mind than 
anybody in the country,” Hutchins 
said. “She’s like a Rolodex.

“People from all over the country 

would call her and say, ‘Hey do you 
remember this kid that played for 
a certain team?’ and (Tholl) knows 
her name, she knows the year of 
graduation, she knows all about 
her. If Bonnie sees a kid play she 
remembers them for life. She even 
remembers their birthday.”

And with such a strong knack 

for recruitment, it would have been 
easy for Tholl to take every step 
of the recruitment process under 
her wing. But that was never how 

the Michigan coaching dynamic 
worked. Everyone was invested in 
the future of the team, and everyone 
wanted to be involved in all aspects 
of coaching.

The 
recruitment 
of 
senior 

centerfielder Kelly Christner was a 
clear illustration of that.

Christner 
still 
recalls 
that 

Brundage was the first to see her 
play in a game in high school, and 
that she left quite an impression 
on the assistant coach. During the 
game, Christner went for a foul ball 
before colliding with a fence and 
flying off of it.

“I’m pretty sure that’s why 

(Brundage) called Hutch and was 
like, ‘You should check this kid out, 
she’ll do anything.’ ” Christner said. 
“But honestly, she and Bonnie and 
Hutch all rotated around. … I think 
they try to work that in with every 
recruit just so they aren’t focusing 
on one coach.”

While 
this 
deep 
level 
of 

investment 
and 
involvement 

from Hutchins’ coaching staff 
has become commonplace in the 
Michigan 
program, 
Hutchins 

doesn’t take it for granted.

She remembers what it was like 

before having Tholl and Brundage 
around and is very grateful for 
their 
consistent 
presence 
and 

commitment to the program.

“I’m glad I have them,” Hutchins 

said. “I wouldn’t want to live 
without them again.

“Everyone expects that the 

head coach is really invested in 
the program, but the key to our 
success has been that my assistant 
coaches are every bit as invested 
than I am.”

The three core coaches’ equal 

investment in Michigan softball 
comes along with their three 
distinct and strong personalities. 
Because of this, the staff is not 
always in agreement on every small-
scale decision regarding the team.

Every day, the coaches work 

together to prepare their next 
practice — and the planning sessions 
are not always simple. When the 
meetings get heated, and they often 
do, they can last upward of an hour.

But at the end of the day, the 

coaches can consistently agree on 
one thing: They want what’s best 
for the softball team. And given 

the unique circumstance Hutchins 
and her assistants find themselves 
in, they have had more time to 
formulate and perfect a singular 
vision for the team than most other 
coaching units.

“We walk in every day to make 

this program better and to try to 
get us to the College World Series,” 
Hutchins said.

Michigan has seen this vision 

realized many times. With the 
earliest in 1995 and the most recent 
just last year, the Wolverines have 
made 12 WCWS appearances, with 
the trio being together for the last 
eight.

The triad’s cohesion has numbers 

to show for it as well. It has netted 
the Great Lakes Region Coaching 
Staff of the Year accolade on 12 
separate occasions, including the 
last four consecutive years.

In 2005, the coaching staff 

earned Michigan’s first Speedline/
NFCA National Coaching Staff of 
the Year honor. The season was 
monumental, as the Wolverines 
claimed their only NCAA national 
championship and finished the 
season with a program-best 65 
wins.

Undeniably, 
the 
Michigan 

softball program has a lot to be 
proud of.

Yet it is equally important, if 

not more so, that coaches of such 
a celebrated program understand 
how to work with failure and not 
just success. Whether an individual 
is struggling or the team as a whole 
is in a slump, performance will not 
always meet up with expectations.

Last 
year, 
Christner 
dealt 

firsthand with not meeting up to 
her own expectations at the plate. 
Under the tutelage of the seasoned 
coaches, she was able to take on a 
new mindset for this season.

“I think I’ve become much more 

comfortable with failure,” Christner 
said. “Being mentored by them has 
really taught me how to handle it 
and how to come back from it.”

Part of what has made Michigan 

players like Christner feel that they 
are able to come back from a slump 
is having three supportive mentors 
to go to.

And Hutchins shared these 

sentiments.

“We’re very lucky,” she said. “We 

have three people that are all head 
coaches, really.”

Hutchins, from the start, has 

treated her assistants with the 
responsibility 
and 
respect 
of 

equals. This coaching style has paid 
dividends both for the team and for 
the tight-knit nature of the coaching 
staff.

“(We) all have a voice in our staff 

meetings and she wants input from 
everyone,” Brundage said. “She 
doesn’t have an ego where she has to 
be right all the time. It’s pretty cool 
that arguably the greatest coach in 
our sport wants to hear what the 
rest of us think and allows us to 
have a voice.”

The way in which Hutchins 

supervises the staff has given each 
coach the opportunity to learn 
from one another. The Michigan 
coaching philosophy is that no 
matter one’s success and expertise, 
there is always room for growth. 

“(Coaching) 
doesn’t 
get 
old 

for us,” Tholl said. “The game is 
always changing and we are always 
learning. It doesn’t matter if Hutch 
has been the coach for over 30 years 
here, she’s still learning different 
parts of the game.”
