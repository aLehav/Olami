Blood Battle chair 
says changes are 
a step in the right 

direction

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

After a ban that lasted more 

than 30 years, gay and bisexual 
men will soon be able to donate 
blood.

The U.S. Food and Drug 

Administration has recommend-
ed a change to the blood donor 
deferral period for men who have 
sex with men, or MSM. Previous-
ly, MSM were indefinitely barred 
from donating blood. Now, they 
are only prohibited from doing 
so within one year of their last 
sexual contact with a male.

The American Association of 

Blood Banks, America’s Blood 
Centers and the American Red 
Cross issued a joint statement on 
Dec. 23 endorsing the proposal 
which stated the “current life-
time deferral is unwarranted.” 
This is largely due to the effec-
tiveness with which donated 
blood is now tested for diseases. 
Under current policy, all blood 
donations are tested for many 
infectious 
diseases, 
includ-

ing HIV, Hepatitis B and C and 

Syphilis.

LSA senior Samantha Rea, 

chair of the University’s Blood 
Battle, said the recommenda-
tion for change is encouraging, 
but still not enough due to the 
persisting regulation on MSM 
to wait a year after male sexual 
contact to donate. The Blood 
Battle is an annual event held by 
Blood Drives United, a Univer-
sity student organization. Last 
year, BDU started an initiative 
called Bleeding for Equality to 
raise awareness about the FDA’s 
blood donation policy pertaining 
to MSM.

“It’s a step in the right direc-

tion, and it’s exciting that they 
have considered changing the 
policy,” Rea said. “We still don’t 
think it’s enough because it still 
discriminates based on sexual 
orientation.”

The FDA enacted the ban on 

homosexual males and bisexual 
blood donors in 1983 as an early 
response to the AIDS epidemic. 
According to the Center for Dis-
ease Control, MSM are more 
affected by HIV than any other 
group in the United States. At the 
end of 2011, 57 percent of persons 
living with HIV in the United 
States were gay or bisexual men.

According to a December 

article in The New York Times, 
blood can now be better tested

Regulation to 

restrict building 
heights for some 

downtown properties

By EMMA KERR

Daily News Editor

The Ann Arbor City Coun-

cil unanimously voted Mon-
day to regulate future building 
construction on the corner of 
Main Street and William Street, 
changing the zoning of the prop-
erty from D1, core downtown 
area, to D2, or downtown inter-
face area.

Because there were previously 

no lots zoned as D2 within the 
Main Street character district, 
which provides additional regu-
lations for buildings in that area, 
a new rule was also created that 

limits the heights of buildings to 
60 feet on the south side and 120 
feet on the north side when they 
are both in the Main Street char-
acter district and zoned D2.

Property owners and inves-

tors, not the local government, 
determine the types, designs 
and quality of buildings built 
in downtown Ann Arbor. Resi-
dents of Ann Arbor, however, 
took to City Council Monday 
night to voice opinions for and 
against proposed regulations for 
the property at Main Street and 
William Street. The property is 
currently owned by DTE Energy, 
though there are no plans for 
construction on the site at this 
time.

Councilmember Jane Lumm 

(I–Ward 2) said she hopes this 
preventative 
measure,

Imagine using “House of 

Cards” as your political sci-
ence education.

Members of the School of 

Public Health are launching a 
course this semester that they 
hope will engage students in 
a unique dialogue about the 
U.S. health care system based, 
in part, on lessons from the 
entertainment industry. First-
year medical and dental stu-
dents will be required to take 
the course.

The six-week online class 

beginning 
Jan. 
12, 
titled 

“Understanding and Improv-

ing U.S. Healthcare,” is the 
brainchild of Matthew Davis, 
professor of public policy,

In new year, 

state to consider 
education funding, 
LGBTQ proposal 

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Last week, Republican Gov. 

Rick Snyder was sworn in for 
another four years as Michi-

gan’s chief executive.

During his inaugural address, 

Snyder expressed enthusiasm 
about his first term and opti-
mism for his second.

“We were a broken state,” he 

said. “We are a comeback state 
now, a state that is growing and 
thriving.”

Snyder called his efforts to 

improve the state’s economy and 
bring Detroit out of bankruptcy 
as significant accomplishments 
during his first term as gover-

nor. However, he said there is 
more to accomplish in his sec-
ond term.

As discussed in his speech, 

here are five things to keep track 
of during the governor’s second 
term.

Road improvements

The Snyder Administration’s 

main focus is to develop a plan 
to increase funds for Michigan’s 
roads and infrastructure.

Last month, the state legis-

lature approved a ballot initia-
tive to pump an estimated $1.3 
billion into transportation by 
increasing the state sales tax 
and removing the sales tax on 
motor fuel. The proposal will be 
on the May 2015 ballot.

Of the $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion 

will be allotted to renovating 
roads, and $112 million will go 
toward public transit.

The bill passed through the 

State House and Senate with 

Regulators 
relax blood 
donation 
restrictions

SEXUAL ASSAULT

Michigan State University 

administrators update sexual 

misconduct policy

Michigan State University 

has finalized an update to its 
sexual misconduct policy, The 
State News reported. The new 
Relationship Violence & Sex-
ual Misconduct Policy prohib-
its dating violence, domestic 
violence and provides a more 
detailed definition of consent.

The updated policy gives 

amnesty for drug and alcohol 
use to students reporting cases 
of sexual violence. In addition, 
MSU’s website now presents 
clearer descriptions of proce-
dures for investigations and dis-
ciplinary processes in cases of 

sexual misconduct.

Last February, The State 

News reported that the U.S. 
Department of Education was 
investigating MSU’s response to 
allegations of sexual assault.

UCLA announces new 

entrepreneurship minor

The College of Letters and 

Science 
and 
the 
Anderson 

School of Management at the 
University of California, Los 
Angeles, are jointly offering a 
new undergraduate minor in 
entrepreneurship beginning the 
Winter 2015 quarter.

Anderson spokesperson Elise 

Anderson told The Daily Bruin 
that staff from both schools 

began working on the proposal 
18 months prior to submitting 
the minor for approval.

UCLA created the minor in 

response to increasing demand 
from students interested in pur-
suing a career in business.

“There are no undergraduate 

business programs in UCLA,” 
said Linton Wang, a sophomore 
studying business economics. 
“Many (students) who are in the 
major of business economics can 
only take classes on economics 
and accounting, and I think it 
will be a good learning experi-
ence for them.”

Arrest statistics point 
to police slowdown 

Arrests decline in 
New York after two 
police officers killed

NEW YORK (AP) — Despite 

efforts by New York City 
officials to tout a dip in seri-
ous crime, another statistic 
is getting more attention — a 
steep decline in the number 
of arrests across all five bor-
oughs in the two weeks since 
two police officers were shot 
dead in their patrol car.

The 
totals 
suggest 
that 

a rumored work slowdown 
has taken hold amid discord 
between the rank and file and 
Mayor Bill de Blasio, and raise 
questions about what impact it 
could have on the city’s crime 
rate.

Patrick Lynch, head of the 

powerful Patrolmen’s Benev-
olent 
Association, 
insisted 

Tuesday that the union was 

not sanctioning a labor action. 
He pointed to a shootout dur-
ing an armed holdup late Mon-
day that left two plainclothes 
officers wounded as proof that 
it was business as usual at the 
nation’s largest police depart-
ment.

Officers, who are working 

without a contract, are “put-
ting themselves in danger to 
keep this city safe just as they 
always do,” Lynch said.

But the enforcement statis-

tics strongly indicate that the 
slowdown is real, even if it 
was initiated at the grassroots 
level.

Last week, the number of 

summonses for minor crimi-
nal offenses and traffic and 
parking violations decreased 
by more than 90 percent com-
pared with the same week a 
year earlier, statistics show. 
For example, summonses for 
urinating in public were down 
to 347 from more than 4,077 

last year.

Arrests citywide last week 

for more serious offenses were 
down 55 percent. In midtown 
Manhattan alone, they fell to 
112 from 348.

Thomas Reppetto, a police 

expert and author who has 
written extensively about the 
New York Police Department, 
called the results too “over-
whelming” to be coincidental 
and said there could be real-
life consequences for the pub-
lic if left to fester for too long.

“If the law is not being 

enforced in the street, we’re 
all in danger,” Reppetto said. 
“The criminals take their cue 
and run wild.”

The figures first plummeted 

in the week after the two offi-
cers were killed on Dec. 20 in 
a brazen daytime ambush by 
a fugitive who had ranted on 
social media that he wanted 
to avenge the police killings of 
Michael Brown and Eric Gar-
ner. 

The 
patrolmen’s 
deaths 

exacerbated tensions between 
de Blasio and police officers 
already upset by the mayor’s 
remark 
sympathizing 
with 

protesters who claim a pattern 
of excessive force in minority 
communities.

The potential for a slow-

down was evident the day after 
the killings, when word began 
circulating among officers that 
they should wait to respond to 
every radio call with two cars 
and not make arrests “unless 
absolutely necessary.” A recent 
online posting on a site popular 
with police officers referred 
to the stance as “Operation 
Stand-down, Protect Yourself, 
Do Nothing.”

Sgt. Ed Mullins, head of the 

Sergeants Benevolent Asso-
ciation, argued that in the 
current climate, it would only 
make sense that police offi-
cers would take extra precau-
tions that could result in fewer 
arrests.

Chinese goverment 

manages family 
members’ visits to 

site of disaster

SHANGHAI (AP) — Some 

wailed and some staggered with 
grief as relatives of the 36 people 
killed in Shanghai’s New Year’s 
Eve stampede visited the disas-
ter site Tuesday for seventh-
day commemorations that are a 
revered ritual in China.

But each family was allowed 

to stay only about five minutes in 
the tightly managed visits, and 
government workers roughly 
dragged away one middle-aged 
woman when she began crying 
out emotionally.

The 
government’s 
strict 

arrangements 
reflect 
efforts 

to keep tight controls over the 
disaster’s aftermath and pre-
vent distraught relatives from 
coalescing into a critical group 
that would draw sympathy and 
galvanize public calls for greater 
accountability.

“Such a major public safety 

incident can tug the heartstrings 
of the public, and the acts and 
words by victims’ relatives can 

make the public sentiments 
swing, making it a key task for 
authorities to control the fami-
lies, limiting their contacts with 
each other or with the media,” 
said Zhao Chu, a Shanghai-
based independent commenta-
tor.

“Struck by the same trag-

edy, the relatives can easily 
resonate with each other, and 
it’s only natural they want to 
band together to take collec-
tive actions and make collective 
appeals to the public, and that 
could mean the authorities los-
ing control over the social senti-
ments.”

The authorities’ grip over 

such sentiments comes at the 
expense of the victims’ fami-
lies, Zhao said. “The method is 
brusque toward the families, 
preventing them from resorting 
to law and to the media, but — 
in a positive way — it can indeed 
alleviate the shock to the pub-
lic.”

The victims’ relatives laid 

bouquets of white and yellow 
chrysanthemums and bowed 
deeply to the statue of the city’s 
first Communist mayor that 
overlooks the 17 concrete steps 
on Shanghai’s famed riverfront 
known as the Bund where the 

stampede took place.

Three dozen people, includ-

ing a 12-year-old boy, were 
trampled and asphyxiated amid 
a crowd of hundreds of thou-
sands of New Year’s revelers.

Late Tuesday night, Chi-

nese state media reported that 
national authorities as well 
as governments in Shanghai 
and Beijing planned to tighten 
crowd controls during holiday 
events and other mass gather-
ings. The reports in the official 
Xinhua News Agency didn’t 
specify what additional mea-
sures would be taken other than 
canceling events if they violated 
safety rules and enforcing exist-
ing regulations on sales and 
promotions.

Accompanied by government 

workers, the families Tuesday 
were kept in vans waiting for 
their turns to mourn on the 
seventh day after death, when 
the deceased person’s soul is 
believed to return to the earthly 
world after disappearing. Some 
relatives brought photos and 
offered fruits and burned some 
fake money.

Journalists were corralled 

several 
feet 
away 
only 
to 

observe the occasional wails 
from the grieving.

ing, ensures residents are pleased 
with new buildings downtown.

“We did not want to repeat 

the mistake of 413 East Huron, 
creating a massive building that 
overwhelms 
the 
residential 

neighborhoods next to it,” Lumm 
said. “This site, at 425 South Main 
is one that has the same potential, 
and fortunately we do have the 
opportunity to address that risk 
before it becomes a reality.”

Source: City of Ann Arbor
The site at 425 Main St. cur-

rently includes a surface-level 
parking lot and the DTE Energy 
building.

Downtown development has 

been an ongoing conversation in 
the City Council, and when the 
proposed zoning changes to this 
area were presented to the coun-
cil for its first reading on Dec. 1, 
three council members believed 
a D2 limitation was not strict 
enough. There was also some con-
fusion among council members 
as to the meaning of D2 zoning, 
and the council went considered 
multiple amendments to the ordi-
nance, all of which failed. The 

zoning proposal has been under 
consideration since June 2014.

Councilmember Stephen Kun-

selman (D–Ward 3) expressed 
concerns about enforcing strict 
height restraints on downtown 
buildings. He also referred to 
the risk of a repeat of the experi-
ence with the building on 413 E. 
Huron.

“Height limits create blocky 

buildings. I want to see some-
thing different, something more 
palatable to this community,” 
Kunselman said

Other discussions at Monday’s 

meeting surrounded the need 
for an amendment to the city’s 
chicken ordinance (which stipu-
lates regulations for residents 
who wish to have chickens on 
their property) ultimately post-
poned until September, with mul-
tiple council members asking why 
they needed to worry about fixing 
something that is not broken.

City Council is scheduled to 

meet next on Jan. 12 for a Plan-
ning Commission working ses-
sion at the Community Television 
Network building. The Council’s 
next regular meeting will be Jan. 
20 in the normal council cham-
bers in City Hall.

time I looked at myself as a stu-
dent. I studied something I real-
ly love and then all of a sudden 
this kind of put me on the map.”

Prince Charles attended the 

concert and personally gave 
Chan her award. Chan said she 
didn’t know she would meet 
him and was occupied with the 
opportunity to conduct the Lon-
don Symphony Orchestra.

“He was trying to talk to each 

of the contestants and when he 
saw me, he just came straight 
to me and he was just like, ‘You 
know you’re amazing, right?’” 
she said. “I could see that he was 
so moved. That he felt something 
in the concert, in the music and 
he was just like a normal per-
son.”

As winner of LSO’s conduct-

ing 
competition, 
Chan 
will 

receive a year-long contract as 
assistant conductor of the LSO 
and receive a cash prize.

Chan said she is happy to 

receive the award as a female 
artist and hopes it leads the con-
ducting field to acknowledge 
more of its female members.

“There have been female 

conductors out there in leader-
ship positions,” she said. “But of 
course if you compare it to the 

other men out there, we don’t 
have a lot of us working.”

While Chan had a musical 

childhood singing and playing 
piano, her interest in conducting 
derived from the first orches-
tra concert she attended, which 
coincidentally was orchestrated 
by a female conductor.

“It’s so interesting what the 

conductor does,” she said. “You 
don’t make a sound. You make all 
these gestures and people will 
play. And it’s interesting because 
that first concert that I’d seen in 
my life, the conductor was also 
a female conductor, so immedi-
ately something kind of stirred 
up in my heart.”

Chan said the best part of con-

ducting is the leadership aspect 
of the role.

“In the end, you really make 

the team better,” she said. 
“That’s what I love about it. You 
inspire people to become better 
and at the same time you become 
the spirit behind the team.”

After she completes her con-

ducting degree in May, Chan 
hopes to join the LSO and put 
on a concert in her hometown of 
Hong Kong sometime this year.

“It has also been a dream for 

me to bring what I have been 
learning back home to share 
with people back there, like 
my family,” she said. “It would 
be wonderful if a concert could 
happen.”

16 dissenters in the House and 
only Sen. Coleman Young Jr. (D–
Detroit) dissenting in the Senate.

Snyder told the Detroit Free 

Press he found it difficult to find 
an agreeable plan to increase 
revenue for roads during the pri-
mary and general elections last 
fall. However, Snyder urged the 
audience during his inauguration 
address to vote for the initiative 
in the spring.

“We have more work to be 

done in, for example, transporta-
tion,” Snyder said. “No one still 
likes our roads, and we have an 
opportunity to fix that this May.”

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, the Michigan Chamber 
of Commerce and the Detroit 
Regional 
Chamber 
originally 

criticized the plan. The groups 
wanted legislatures to directly 
vote for road improvement laws 
instead of putting an initiative on 
a ballot.

The 
Michigan 
chapter 
of 

Americans for Prosperity, a con-
servative group aligned with the 
Tea Party, has also criticized the 
proposal for increasing taxes on 
the middle class.

Education funding

The ballot initiative to raise 

the sales tax will also determine 
whether $300 million a year will 
be added toward Michigan’s pub-
lic schools.

The bill, which will remove 

sales tax on motor fuel, will sub-
sequently freeze the School Aid 
Fund that relies on funding from 
this tax.

To help offset losses from this 

fund, part of the new statewide 
sales tax will go toward educa-
tion, on top of additional funding 
from the general fund.

Snyder also lauded his admin-

istration’s investment in pre-
school 
education 
during 
his 

inaugural address, which was 
included in his $15.8 billion bud-
get in June.

In 2011, the governor cut fund-

ing to higher education by 15 
percent, but has since increased 
funding by 3.1 percent, 2.2 per-
cent and 6.1 percent in 2012, 2013 
and 2014, respectively.

Employment

The governor also mentioned 

the need to foster innovation and 
creative thinking in the state. He 
discussed the need to reinvigo-
rate skilled trades, such as con-
struction and manufacturing, as 
an “honorable career path,” while 
making technical education a pri-
ority.

Michigan’s 
unemployment 

rate currently stands at 6.7 per-
cent, 0.9 percent higher than the 
national average. According to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
the state’s unemployment rate 
has dropped 3.2 percent since 
November 2008, though 193,909 
citizens have left the labor force.

During his first term, Snyder 

created and funded various pro-
grams to promote skilled trades 
as a way to boost the state’s 
employment. The largest, Skilled 
Trades Training Fund, was cre-
ated in 2013 to expand training 
and hiring for trade-skilled busi-
nesses.

In October, the governor estab-

lished the Community College 
Skilled Trades Equipment Pro-
gram to work with community 
colleges to provide skilled trades 
training for students. The pro-
gram cost $50 million.

Throughout his first term, Sny-

der also promoted technical edu-
cation through various pieces of 
legislation, including Senate Bill 
66, which requires public schools 
to provide information on oppor-
tunities in technical careers, as 
well as guidance for including 
career and technical educational 
classes in the core curriculum.

Snyder’s inauguration address 

suggested continued focus on 
these areas to lower the state’s 
unemployment numbers.

“Let’s lead the nation in the 

career tech education and the 
skilled trades,” he said in the 
address.

Detroit’s revitalization

During his inaugural speech, 

the governor said one of his 
proudest accomplishments dur-
ing his tenure was his work with 
the city of Detroit.

“Detroit has a bright future, 

and I’m committed in supporting 
the city and achieving that goal,” 
he said.

In 2013, the city filed for bank-

ruptcy, making it the largest city 
in American history to do so. At 
the time of bankruptcy, Detroit 
was $18 billion in debt.

In 2013, Snyder appointed Uni-

versity alum Kevyn Orr as the 
city’s emergency manager. The 
two devised the “grand bargain,” 
a controversial bankruptcy-exit 
plan that shed some of the city’s 
debt to pensioners, but involved 
work with the government, busi-
nesses and the Detroit Institute 
of Arts to slowly contribute $816 
million over time to reduce the 
financial impact on pensioners.

Though the bankruptcy con-

cluded, critics have said the 
“grand bargain” has not resulted 
in sufficient funds for the city. 
The plan only generated about 
$900 million and projected rev-
enue remains almost stagnant 
until 2023.

In October, Snyder touted the 

city’s comeback during a talk at 
the Law School.

LGBTQ equality

Though the governor did not 

mention social issues directly in 
his speech, he has come under 
criticism throughout his term for 
the state’s legislation regarding 
LGBTQ rights.

During 
the 
state 
Senate’s 

recent lame-duck session, the 
legislature failed to pass amend-
ments to the Elliott-Larsen Civil 
Rights 
Act, 
which 
currently 

protects citizens from discrimi-
nation based on religion, race, 
ethnicity, age, weight and marital 
status, but not for sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity.

Michigan 
gained 
national 

attention when the Sixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals issued a stay 
on U.S. District Judge Bernard 
Friedman’s decision to allow 
same-sex marriage in the state. 
The circuit court upheld the ban 
this May.

Many critics have called for 

Snyder to take a stronger stance 
on these issues during his second 
term.

which will feature a variety of 
documentary-type video seg-
ments, video interviews with fac-
ulty and interactive elements such 
as games and online forums.

The course creators said they 

sought to approach online edu-
cation in a unique way not yet 
seen at the University, which 
has made efforts to implement 
a range of online offerings in 
recent years.

“This is the first time a course 

has been offered in this way,” 
Rubyan said. “Not that we’re 
presenting a drama, but what we 
try to do is bring different nug-
gets of that type of thought pro-
cess into this space, so that when 
people are watching they have a 
sense of scope and feel like it’s 
moving, it’s dynamic.”

Presented 
in 
hour-long 

weekly installments, the course 
aims to provide students with 
knowledge of the U.S. health 
care system, Davis said. The 
lessons will help students learn 
their place in the system — an 
effort that frustrates and con-
fuses many Americans — and, 
more importantly, learn how 
they can work to improve the 
system in the future.

Though ongoing health care 

reforms, such as the 2010 Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care 
Act, will be discussed, Davis 
said the course is designed with 
ample historical context. He 
wants to demonstrate that many 
of the current issues have been 
going on for at least 70 years. 

Davis and Rubyan pulled vid-
eos from historical archives and 
presidential libraries to demon-
strate how various administra-
tions have approached health 
care since the time of former 
President Harry Truman.

“The Affordable Care Act 

becomes so much more under-
standable through this lens of 
history,” Davis said. “We’ve 
taken the time to boil down 70 
years of history into key themes 
that have an arch through all 
these presidents.”

The course will also feature 

filmed interviews and panel 
discussions with experts from 
the University’s Institute for 
Healthcare Policy and Innova-
tion. Unlike some online cours-
es, which consist of a professor 
lecturing over a video slide-
show, Davis said the format is 
intended to engage students 
and make the material enter-
taining to watch.

“Another 
benefit 
of 
the 

online format … is the chance to 
combine many different teach-
ing and learning approaches,” 
Davis said. “In many cases, 
online learning at (the Univer-
sity) is a video of a lecture — 
that’s not what this is.”

As is typical with online 

courses 
currently 
offered 

through the provider Cours-
era, students have the ability 
to earn a certificate acknowl-
edging their completion of the 
course, but cannot get Universi-
ty credit. Davis said the course 
is intended as a “co-curricular” 
opportunity, one which stu-
dents from across the Universi-
ty could use to supplement their 
standard course schedule.

to ensure it does not contain the 
AIDS virus. Modern tests can 
detect and diagnose a human 
immunodeficiency virus infec-
tion, which causes AIDS, with-
in nine to 11 days of exposure. 
The article also highlighted 
data from Australia that con-
cluded that after a 12-month 
period, there was no significant 
increase in the risk of trans-
fusion-transmitted HIV from 
MSM donors.

Rea added that a more equita-

ble policy change would ensure 

the safety of all blood from all 
sexually active donors, rather 
than solely MSM.

“The FDA needs to test 

unsafe sexual practices for all 
donors,” she said. “It’s abso-
lutely unwarranted to do so just 
based on sexual orientation.”

Rea said BDU plans to keep 

advocating for more accepting 
policy changes.

“We will continue advocat-

ing for a greater change, but 
now hopefully we will get more 
donors,” she said. “It gives some 
hope that there will be more 
changes made in the future, but 
we still want to be pushing for 
more.”

Venezualan textbooks teach socialism

Math and science 
are taught in the 

context of the 
government

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) 

— Students here study math 
by calculating the benefits of 
government 
land 
takeovers. 

They practice English by recit-
ing where late President Hugo 
Chavez was born and learn civ-
ics by explaining why the elderly 
should give him thanks.

Pro-administration messages 

scattered through the pages 
of Venezuela’s textbooks have 
become yet another point of 
conflict in this hyper-polarized 
country, where Chavez’s social-
ist party won a bare majority in 
the presidential elections of 2013.

Parents recently tossed books 

into the streets in front of some 
schools and burned them, acts 
the loyalist media compared to 
censorship by the Nazis in 1930s 
Germany. As children head back 
to school after winter break, 
many Venezuelans remain out-
raged over texts that treat the 
founder of a deeply divisive 
socialist revolution with the 
sort of reverence U.S. textbooks 
reserve for George Washington.

Math lessons include calcula-

tions of how much production 
has increased as a result of the 
government’s agrarian reform 
initiative, and how much land 
the government still has to 
reclaim from private owners. 
Students are asked to figure out 
how much shoppers save at gov-
ernment-subsidized 
appliance 

stores created by Chavez.

Learning English? Answer 

the question, “Where was Hugo 
Chavez born?”

“They are brainwashing our 

kids, erasing our nation’s his-
tory, and replacing it with their 
own version,” said information 
technology worker Hector Cue-
vas, who was appalled when his 
son brought home the books as a 

sixth-grader.

For defenders, the “Bolivar-

ian” textbooks introduced in 
2011 include history traditionally 
left out of grade school educa-
tion, and tie lessons to real-life 
examples in socialist Venezuela.

Minister of Education Hector 

Rodriguez defended the books 
this fall, and also urged critics 
to work with the government to 
improve the collection.

“Certainly 
they 
can 
be 

improved, 
like 
any 
human 

endeavor,” he said, according 
to Venezuelan news website 
Noticias24. “Those who want to 
criticize should read the books, 
and when they find an error they 
should let us know to correct it.”

But for opponents, the prob-

lem is not errors so much as what 
they see as attacks on govern-
ment foes and propaganda for 
controversial programs.

An early edition of the gov-

ernment’s social studies book 
shows a photo of an elderly per-
son writing, “Thanks, Chavez” 
and instructs students to explain 
why.

One book interrupts an expla-

nation of fractions to praise a 
food program “developed by the 
Bolivarian government to ensure 
that the poor can eat.”

While all students receive the 

books, they are in widest use 
in poor areas, where they are 
often the only option for teach-
ers. At Consuelo Navas Tovar 
high school at the fringes of one 
of Caracas’ sprawling slums, 
students in navy blue uniforms 
study their English textbooks 
at grimy desks crammed into a 
bare-walled classroom.

The book has students discuss 

a study hall sponsored by a gov-
ernment agency known by an 
arcane acronym.

“It’s a project of FUNDABIT!” 

one student is told to say.

“That is excellent!” the part-

ner replies.

Geometry professor Tomas 

Guardia of Central University 
of Venezuela has spent months 
documenting what he and his 
colleagues call basic errors in 
math books. One defines a square 
as a shape with four sides, when 

that could be a rectangle or a 
rhombus.

“I’m not a historian, but if the 

math textbook is so problematic, 
there’s a good chance this book is 
also full or errors and propagan-
da” he said, gesturing to a photo 
of Chavez embracing a child in 
social studies book captioned, 
“The future of the land of Bolivar 
is her children.”

Cuevas, 
meanwhile, 
often 

pulls out his father’s old math 
textbook to use as a reference 
for his son. He fantasizes about 
a collection of textbooks that 
would reflect his less-sunny 
vision of modern Venezuela.

“They always use examples 

like, ‘If your mother goes to a 
government-subsidized 
super-

market and buys two pounds 
of sugar and three pounds of 
meat, how many pounds does 
she have?’” he said. “Why don’t 
they use an example like, ‘If you 
mother spends two hours in lines 
waiting to buy sugar, and later 
waits three hours to buy meat, 
how many hours has she wait-
ed?’”

A

lthough the season of giving 
recently ceased, the need 
for donations of one of the 

most 
necessary 

resources 
remains constant. 
Blood 
circulates 

unceasingly 
through 
our 

veins, 
providing 

our bodies with 
components 
essential 
for 

survival. 
Yet 

dependence upon 
this combination 
of cells is overlooked until dire 
circumstances lead to a deficiency. 
Due to a tremendous ability to 
replenish it, we can donate blood 
to individuals in drastic need. The 
demand, however, still outweighs the 
supply. Therefore, blood collection 
agencies 
should 
unquestionably 

maximize the entire population of 
eligible donors. Doing so requires 
banishing unfair deferral practices. 
Though 
the 
Food 
and 
Drug 

Administration recently announced 
plans for the upheaval of a ban on 
donations from homosexual and 
bisexual men, its revised policy 
remains far from inclusive.

According to the American Red 

Cross, less than 10 percent of eligible 
donors give blood, but roughly 
38 percent of the United States 
population is currently deemed 
eligible. I, for numerous years, 
have constituted a part of this tiny 
percentage of donors. I’ve both 
worked and participated in blood 
drives, and I still donate annually. 
Unlike some of my more squeamish 
counterparts, I’m not bothered by 
needles or the sight of blood.

I’ve also been lucky — consider-

ing my astoundingly low iron lev-
els — to have consistently met all of 
the requirements. Friends, family 
and classmates were deferred from 
donating. Some didn’t meet the mini-
mum weight requirement. Some pos-
sessed low iron levels, while others 

were unable to donate due to recently 
traveling abroad or getting a tattoo. 
However, falling under the status of 
“men who have had sex with men” 
(MSM) was, by far, the most discrim-
inatory reason why those close to me 
were deferred. Even today, friends of 
mine — some who are far healthier 
than me and are probably capable 
of making double red cell donations 
— would be unjustly deferred on the 
basis of sexuality.

Previously, a ban upheld by the 

FDA — initiated in 1993 — prohib-
ited “men who have had sex with 
other men, at any time since 1977” 
from donating blood. On Dec. 23, the 
agency proposed to remove the pol-
icy and instead institute a 12-month 
deferral period. Gay and bisexual 
men, under the revised program, 
could now donate blood, but there’s 
a stipulation. In order to remain 
eligible donors, the men must not 
have engaged in sexual activity with 
another man for a year.

Eliminating 
the 
heavily 
dis-

criminatory and archaic prohibi-
tion on donations from the gay and 
bisexual community undoubtedly 
demonstrates an attempt at embrac-
ing equality and good intentions to 
amend issues. However, good inten-
tions don’t suffice. The new deferral 
period is meant to increase the pool 
of eligible donors. By finally grant-
ing bisexual and gay men the ability 
to donate, the prospective expansion 
is expected — according to a study 
by the University of California, Los 
Angeles — to raise the current blood 
supply by two to four percent.

For the University and other 

institutions holding extensive annu-
al blood drives — such as the Blood 
Battle — the inclusion of this student 
demographic would lead to more 
successful efforts and more patients 
receiving crucial aid. However, the 
new policy stigmatizes individuals 
in a manner similar to the previous 
restriction. Men from the gay and 
bisexual communities are eligible 
to donate only if they don’t possess 

active sex lives. Even if the student 
or individual is in a monogamous, 
responsible relationship, they still 
will be denied. No identical policy 
requires heterosexual individuals to 
remain celibate for a year in order to 
donate. Rather, the policy suggests 
gay and bisexual individuals must 
alter an aspect of their relation-
ships that remains unquestioned for 
heterosexuals. According to a state-
ment by FDA, the rationale for the 
new restriction is that “compelling 
scientific evidence is not available 
at this time to support a change to 
a deferral period less than one year 
while still ensuring the safety of the 
blood supply.”

Even if testing methods for HIV 

were inefficient in earlier decades, 
technology is far more advanced at 
discovering infections within the 
blood — discerning issues within a 
matter of nine days. To further ensure 
no problems arise, each sample of 
blood is examined — regardless of the 
donor’s gender. The same measures 
utilized to ensure the safety of the 
blood donated by sexually active 
heterosexual individuals can be used 
for gay and bisexual donors.

Many countries utilize a similar 

deferral, but others collect blood on 
a case-by-case basis. If thoroughness 
in guaranteeing safety is the concern 
supporting this method of collection, 
then institute the deferral period 
on a very limited basis as definitive 
research is conducted to determine 
the magnitude of any potential risks 
and to promptly revise the policy to 
be more realistic — by focusing upon 
individual donations instead of ste-
reotyping. Although it demonstrates 
some progress, the deferral is unnec-
essarily discriminatory. Blood drives 
are meant to aggregate life-saving 
resources. 
Donation 
regulations 

shouldn’t unfairly require one’s abil-
ity to do a good deed to be dictated by 
their sexuality.

A new year, a new Schlissel? 

I

, 
for 
one, 
have 
been 
thoroughly 

underwhelmed by University President 
Mark Schlissel since his installment 

as the 14th president of the University of 
Michigan. To be fair, I was underwhelmed at the 
announcement of his presidency last January, 
prior to public acceptance of the job. Based on 
his background in higher education, his visible 
identities and his expressed intent in taking the 
most highly esteemed position at this university, 
I didn’t see what he could bring to a campus such 
as ours. For much of the University community, 
the 2013-2014 academic year was one of 
community upheaval and nationally publicized 
campus turmoil. I wasn’t sure what expertise 
Schlissel could bring to our campus community 
that would help address the institutional fault 
lines and communal fractures that were so 
clearly in need of attention, resources and just 
blatant recognition.

Six months in to his official term as the 

supreme power of all things Michigan (empha-
sis on the block ‘M’), I still haven’t quite figured 
out what exactly that special something is. In 
the past six months, Schlissel has really let me 
down. Not that I expected anything outside of 
the administrative status quo from him, but 
even with the tragically low expectations I had, 
Schlissel had some pretty impressive moments of 
blatant disregard for the student communities he 
was hired to represent. Ranging from his com-
ments on student-athletes as not all academically 
“qualified,” to his dismissal of student demands 
in relation to sexual assault on campus, he hasn’t 
exactly proven his commitment to the various 
student communities.

The good news, though, is that Schlissel is only 

six months into his inaugural term. He still has 
plenty of time to really prove his commitment 
to students and show us that he is more than an 
administrative mouthpiece — that he is an educa-
tor committed to investing in all students, in all of 
their interests and in all of their identities; that he 
is committed to actualizing the concept of “diver-
sity” in all of its forms, not just using the word in 
public forms. So as I write my own resolutions 
for the New Year, I have decided to take it upon 
myself to write a couple for Schlissel as well.

1) Uplift Student Voices
In a statement published by the Daily on 

Nov. 30, Schlissel responded to a list of student 
demands regarding sexual assault on campus 
by saying, “The one thing I will object to, which 
drives me a little nutty, is framing things as 
demands. I think that makes it really difficult to 
have discussions.”

This statement dismisses and silences stu-

dents’ feelings and experiences with sexual 
assault on campus, as well as their efforts toward 

change. It shows a blatant disregard for some 
survivors’ and allies’ frustration with the cur-
rent administrative dialogue and action around 
assault at the University.

In December, University of Pennsylvania 

President Amy Gutmann joined students at 
her annual holiday party as they staged a “die-
in” after the no-indictment verdict in both the 
Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases. This is 
the type of administrative action that empow-
ers students. Regardless of how Gutmann feels 
about the verdicts, she was showing solidar-
ity for her students and affirming their feelings. 
While Schlissel didn’t have to agree with any of 
the demands, he needed to affirm the feelings of 
those who wrote them, not mock his students, 
both survivors and their allies.

2) Stop “Listening,” Start Engaging
I really do commend Schlissel on the dozens 

of campus conversations he has held with stu-
dents over the past six months. It’s critical for any 
administrator making decisions on behalf of stu-
dents to actually meet with the students whose 
lives their decisions impact. But there is a differ-
ence between simply listening to and actually 
engaging with student concerns. And from what 
I have personally experienced and heard from 
my peers, there has been a lot of selective listen-
ing and very minimal active engagement.

While recognizing six months is a very short 

period of time, it’s inexcusable to be in several 
intentional meetings with the president and not 
once have him, or anyone on his behalf, take a 
single note on the “student feedback and input” 
that was requested. During numerous fireside 
chats (conversations where invited “campus 
leaders” met with Schlissel for an hour to talk 
about campus concerns), not once did Schlissel 
write down a student concern, publicly acknowl-
edge and engage a student grievance or (to my 
knowledge) schedule follow-up meetings with 
any of the students in those meetings.

So for the next convergence of “student lead-

ers” that Schlissel plans to hold, it would be wise 
for him to make a sincere effort to actively engage 
with the invited students. This means doing 
homework about who is in the room, what kinds 
of experiences have students in the room had and 
what work have they already done on the initia-
tives being discussed.

While I may not be his biggest fan, it’s one of 

my resolutions in the New Year to not freeze peo-
ple in time, and to allow others the space to learn 
and grow as I have been afforded.

So, happy New Year, President Schlissel. Let’s 

make this one better than the last.

The economics of oil

Y

ou’re going to get groceries, either in 
your car or in the passenger seat of your 
friend’s car. You notice the car’s gas 

tank is on empty, and either 
you or your friend drives the 
vehicle into a gas station. 
You expect to spend around 
$4 a gallon. However, to 
your elation, you realize that 
gas prices are incredibly low. 
It’s probably around $2 per 
gallon.

With the recent dip in 

gas prices, I’m sure that 
many of you have either 
experienced or seen some-
one else’s excitement over low gas prices. It’s 
great to save a nice chunk of money without 
sacrificing consumption.

But it’s interesting to see how your saving at 

the pump is influencing the entire world.

The reason for your savings is actually quite 

an extensive tale. A few months ago, production 
of oil in the United States rose dramatically as 
a controversial rock-splitting process known 
as fracking exposed significant oil deposits in 
North Dakota and Texas.

With the United States adding extra supply 

of oil into the international market, basic 
supply and demand models inform us that the 
increased supply spurs a decrease in price. 
This implies that for prices to remain the 
same, international countries must decrease 
oil output.

This simply wasn’t going to happen.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting 

Countries — OPEC for short — is an 
organization that works with the world’s 
largest oil-exporting countries (besides Russia) 
to regulate the market for oil. The organization 
met for a regular meeting on Nov. 27 to discuss 
whether to produce less oil, which they decided 
against. Since these countries are economically 
dependent on the oil market, losing a piece of 
the market pie to America would be detrimental 
to the countries’ long-term financial stability 
— even if they must endure lost revenue from 
lower prices in the short run.

So, major oil producers like Saudi Arabia — 

the country in OPEC that supplies the most oil 
— are taking the hit. They’re willing to let oil 
drop to $20 per barrel compared to the $110 per 
barrel prices over the summer.

And while OPEC is indifferent to these 

reduced prices, Russia, the largest exporter of 
oil, is terrified.

The ex-finance minister of Russia is quoted 

as saying, “We are entering a full-fledged 
economic crisis.” Being the largest exporter 
of oil in the world, the country is on the brink 
of a two-year recession. Russia spiked interest 
rates to the highest rate in 16 years to stabilize 
their economy, and inflation is predicted to be 
12 to 15 percent. This all results in a predicted 
economic output contraction of 7.9 percent. Not 
good for the former Soviet Union.

I’m sure you’re reading this and asking why 

this international economics influences college 
students. Perhaps I’m being a tad of a nerd, but 
isn’t it at least slightly fascinating that your 
economic saving has such a wide impact? That 
it’s the topic of conversation in OPEC meetings 
involving 12 countries?

Plus, decreased oil prices could lead to 

decreased costs for plane travel and express 
delivery companies, which could translate 
to cheaper expenses for you flying home or 
ordering textbooks via FedEx.

These prices also influence your spending 

in areas outside of traveling. If you’ve saved 
money, you’re likely spending it elsewhere. 
More consumption equals a boost in production, 
labor and company revenues benefitting from 
heightened purchases. Your Espresso Royale 
owners, Uber drivers and producers of Crystal 
Palace are probably feeling these effects.

Additionally, 
even 
though 
your 

consumption contributes to the negative 
economic echoes in Russia and Saudi Arabia, 
you may also be their savior.

While a decrease in international supply 

could take prices back to normal, so could an 
increased demand.

Saudi Arabia believes this too, as stated by 

their oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi. The intuition 
behind this is that the dip in gas prices 
will incentivize drivers to drive more. This 
increased demand for gas would eventually 

T

his Winter Break, I took a 
three-week solo road trip 
down the West Coast. I 

started in Seattle, worked my way 
down to Portland, to San Francisco, 
to Los Angeles and finally to 
 

San Diego.

It was my first time traveling by 

myself for such an extended period 
of time. Needless to say, it was a 
thrilling, life-changing experience, 
but it was also a terrifying one.

I am a 19-year-old female, and I 

was traveling alone in parts of the 
country I had never visited before. I 
was equipped with no acquaintances 
and a delusional sense of direction in 
each city. I intended to embark open-
mindedly with the belief that every-
one I met had the best intentions. On 
the contrary, I found myself much 
more distrustful and wary — some-
thing that still deeply disturbs me.

Before I left, I packed my bags 

with paranoid precaution. I made 
sure to remove my lanyard from my 
wallet, just to eliminate easy access 
for thievery. I sewed pouches into 
all of my underwear so I could carry 
my cash and cards by hand. I double-, 
tripled-checked to make sure each 
pair of pants I brought had pockets so 
I could store a pepper spray in each 
one. I crossed off skirts, short-shorts 
and any sort of V-neck shirt from 
my packing list just to eliminate any 
potential desire for my body. Perhaps 
these were subconscious, automatic 
instincts or perhaps they were 
conscious ones that represented a 
cumulative understanding of what I 
learned growing up.

I wanted, so badly, to trust every 

single person I met on the way — but 
society has raised me with an innate 
stranger-danger mindset. As a young 
woman, I have naturally grown to 
fear all unfamiliar men, especially 
if they are walking in my direction 
late at night. It feels ridiculous as a 
modern-day woman to guard myself 
with this mentality, to keep my walls 
up because of this anxiety. I should 
not have to take these precautions 
simply because I am female, nor 

should I harbor this inherently 
terrified mentality. But I do.

I began to wonder: Could my 

mentality be categorized as sexist? 
At a superficial level of generalizing 
all men as potential threats: yes, that 
is sexist. However, when it came 
down to resorting to stereotypes to 
determine my safety, I justified it as 
a pass I could give myself. I saw all 
those Lifetime movies and Dateline 
20/20 episodes where women met 
awful fates simply because they 
didn’t take enough caution. The 
prevalence of female victimization 
stories in the media has elevated the 
statistics to feel higher than they 
actually are. This is not to say that 
assault should be downplayed or 
ignored — it’s certainly important 
to be updated and reminded of their 
occurrence. However, their domi-
nance in the news makes it easier 
to spotlight all men as individuals 
with suspicious intentions.

I began to ponder: If I was walking 

down a city street alone late at night, 
and there happens to be a male walk-
ing in my direction, what would I do? 
Though I certainly wish I could say 
I would brush the thought off and 
continue on my way, that is not true. 
I admit, I would instantly clutch onto 
the mace in my pocket and automati-
cally label him as a potential threat 
to my safety — just in case anything 
were to happen. I realize it’s terrible 
to categorize all men into this hurt-
ful stereotype, but in a situation that 
involves my safety, I often give myself 
an excuse to use this “sexism.”

Then, I began to contemplate 

more complex situations. Say it 
was late at night and I was walking 
down an urban street alone. On 
my left, a white male was strolling 
nonchalantly in my direction. On 
my right, a calm black male was also 
moving in my direction. Upon first 
impression, neither may pose an 
immediate threat — but I can’t help 
but wonder which side of the street I 
would naturally veer toward if forced 
to make an on-the-spot choice.

I have never been in this specific 

situation, but I unfortunately have 
a terrible hunch. As a woman of 
color raised by school systems 
that emphasize diversity, I have 
been taught values of equality 
that I wholeheartedly believe in. 
I would like to think of myself 
as a progressive individual far 
beyond discrimination of any kind. 
However, how is it that society — or 
something inherently wicked within 
me — has made me naturally and 
subconsciously succumb to racism 
and sexism? Even as an educated 
millennial, why do I still carry these 
thoughts? We all carry an obscure 
xenophobia 
based 
on 
negative 

stereotypes, but we cannot pinpoint 
exactly why. We intrinsically fear 
other sexes and diverse ethnicities 
— simply because our culture has 
constructed and heightened this fear 
from a young age.

As a woman, I don’t want to 

carry around four pepper sprays 
everywhere I go. I don’t want to 
have to think about a man’s crotch — 
specifically, how I can possibly knee 
him there — whenever I encounter 
the opposite sex. I’d like to not worry 
about how provocative my clothing 
may be or how to possibly keep my 
belongings intact.

I am not the only female who 

carries these fears, and also not 
the only one who takes precautions 
based on stereotypes. So how do we 
change this widespread xenophobic 
mentality and exaggerated fear? 
More important than creating this 
change on a societal level, it’s vital 
we first change these thoughts 
within ourselves. Clearly, this is 
easier said than done. Where do we 
distinguish the fine line between 
protecting 
ourselves 
and 
not 

generalizing based on typecasts? I, 
like many others, am still searching 
for the complex, nuanced answer to 
all these queries, but the solution 
seems to be just as ambiguous as 
the questions themselves.

Protection or generalization?

compensate the oversupply of oil 
in the economy. Therefore, your 
purchase of more gas could increase 
prices, reviving the Russian economy.

So, two weeks from now, when 

you and your friends are planning 
that spring break trip to Florida or 
Cancun, the thought will cross your 
head that you have to tell your par-
ents. Maybe they’ll be fine with it, but 

if they’re not, you have an out. If they 
raise concerns about the boozing and 
risks associated with partying in the 
sunshine, fire back at them that this 
trip has nothing to do with Spring 
Break. Rather, your road trip or flight 
is a calculated attempt at consuming 
gas to create an equilibrium in the 
international economy. You’re trying 
to stimulate Saudi Arabia’s economy; 

you’re trying to be the Mother Teresa 
to the entirety of Russia. Advising 
against this trip is simply a disservice 
to the goodwill of the world.

Okay, maybe that won’t work, but 

if it does, you’ll be thanking me for

Class of 2014 winter graduates listen to NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden, Jr., the commencement speaker, discuss 
the importance of love prevailing in the face of conflict and tragedy.

Demonstration 

draws attention to 
policy brutality

By JENNIFER CALFAS and 

SAM GRINGLAS

Editor in Chief and 

Managing News Editor

Multiple keynote speakers 

called on graduates to use their 
diplomas to promote positive 
change at the 2014 Winter Com-
mencement on Sunday. But after 
the ceremony, guests exited the 
Crisler Center to find about 60 
students taking that drive to 
heart.

Outside Crisler, protesters 

gathered for a “die-in” to call 
for an end to police brutality 
and racial profiling. The event 
follows several similar events 
held on campus in recent weeks 
to protest grand jury decisions 
not to indict police officers 
responsible for the deaths of 
two unarmed Black men in Fer-
guson, Mo. and Staten Island, 
New York.

Among several speeches and 

musical performances during 
the ceremony, University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel, Univer-
sity Provost Martha Pollack and 
NASA Administrator Charles F. 
Bolden, Jr., the commencement 
speaker, pushed graduates to 
challenge the status quo as they 
begin their lives outside of the 
University.

In opening his speech, Bold-

en echoed the remarks of the 
2013 Commencement Speaker 
Michele Norris, a renowned 
journalist, who said love should 
prevail in light of conflict and 
tragedy across the nation.

After protests and calls for 

reform erupted across the coun-
try over the last few months, 
Bolden called on University’s 
graduates to play a part in fos-
tering change.

“Much as it was for the class 

of (2013), you arrived at this day 
of celebration with our nation 
still struggling to provide peace 
and justice for all its citizens,” 
he said. “You are well prepared 
and ready to make a difference.”

Under 
his 
leadership 
as 

NASA’s first Black administra-
tor, NASA landed a rover on 
Mars and launched a spacecraft 
to Jupiter, among other feats, 
after President Barack Obama 
nominated 
Bolden 
to 
head 

NASA in 2009.

“It’s time for you to go out 

and challenge the status quo. 
It’s the mission of the Univer-
sity of Michigan to, and I quote, 
‘Educate leaders and citizens 
to challenge the present and 
enrich the future.’”

During his first commence-

ment ceremony, Schlissel said 
he had been looking forward to 
this day since he was selected 
as the University’s 14th presi-
dent in January. In his address, 
Schlissel asked graduates to 
chart their own “Michigan sto-
ries.”

“I ask, because the stories 

that intrigue me most, those 
that drive me and inspire me, 
are the stories yet to be writ-
ten,” he said. “You have the tools 
to help individuals and entire 
populations. You can create new 
knowledge and inspire commu-
nities. You have the optimism 
and entrepreneurial spirit to 
take on the biggest challenges 
– and you have your Michigan 
family to cheer you on and sup-
port you every step of the way.”

University Provost Martha 

Pollack opened the ceremony, 
thanking students for their 
activism on campus and passion 
for social justice. One of her 
main wishes for graduates, she 
noted, was for them to take risks 
and challenge existing social 
norms.

“I don’t think you (will) shy 

away from, but instead will seek 
out challenges throughout your 
life,” Pollack said.

When 
listing 
possibilities 

for students to promote change 
after graduation, Pollack lauded 
student activism and the stu-
dents’ desire for an equitable, 
diverse campus.

“Perhaps, as so many of you 

have done during your time 
at Michigan, you will become 
involved in social activism, 
challenging all of us to become 
a better, more equitable and 
inclusive society.”

After 
Schlissel 
conferred 

degrees, hundreds of under-
graduate, graduate and doctor-
ate students, family and friends 
exiting Crisler were greeted by 
dozens of protesters laying on 
the plaza.

Though die-in protests held 

across the country over the 
past few weeks typically last 
4.5 minutes to represent the 
4.5 hours Ferguson resident 
Michael Brown spent on the 
ground after he was shot and 
killed by a police officer, pro-
testers remained in position 
until the hundreds of com-
mencement guests funneled out 
of Crisler.

As commencement attend-

ees exited Crisler, they walked 
around — or through — the 
group of protestors on the 
ground. 
Some 
encouraged 

them, while others voiced dis-
taste in their choice of timing 
the protest after the graduation 
ceremony.

LSA senior Canon Thomas, 

one of the event’s organizers, 
said demonstrating after the 
commencement ceremony pro-
vided an opportunity to reach a 
wider audience beyond Univer-
sity students. He also empha-
sized the ties between the 
occasion of receiving a degree 
and taking steps to enact posi-
tive change.

“Once you get your degree, 

as I understand from the mis-
sion statement, you’re supposed 
to go out in the world and make 
change,” he said. “You’re sup-
posed to take your degree and 
make the world a better place. 
So yes you have your degree, 

you have it in hand, now what? 
Come join us and tell everyone 
with your degree that Black 
lives matter. We didn’t do it 
before or during, we did it after. 
As you walk to your car, I want 
you to remember Black lives 
matter. If it’s not appropriate, 
when is the time? When is the 
right time for justice?”

Law Prof. Martha Jones, who 

stood beside the students for 
several minutes during the pro-
test and teared up as she spoke 
about the demonstration, said 
she couldn’t imagine a better 
moment to communicate to the 
graduates’ family, friends and 
supporters what students have 
been working on and thinking 
about during the past semester.

“It 
makes 
me 
optimistic 

because I think that when we 
charge students with gradua-
tion and commencement and 
(think about) who they’ll be… 
we want them to be citizens of 
the world and to not only have 
ideas, but to act on their ideas 
and this to me seems to be abso-
lutely the embodiment of that.”

Jones also said this type of 

broad discussion pairs well with 
the conversations about diver-
sity and inclusion currently 
underway at the University.

“We still have a serious 

conversation in house about 
students, and numbers and per-
centages that shouldn’t be lost 
even as we’re now very much 
part of this national conversa-
tion that is focused on police 
violence — that the experience 
of our students at Michigan is 
still very much tied to our num-
bers. So I hope that we’ll contin-
ue with that commitment and 
still working on that very chal-
lenging problem while we’re 
also part of this bigger discus-
sion. They’re really companion 
pieces,” she said.

LSA junior Rachel Webb, 

another organizer for the dem-
onstration, worked with Uni-
versity Police to ensure the 
protest was peaceful and did not 
obstruct the ceremony. While 
Webb recognized the need to 
end police brutality, she noted 
that protesters must not assume 
all officers profile citizens based 
on race.

“We were proud of the police 

officers who stood in solidar-
ity with us,” Webb said, noting 
that her father is a police officer. 
“They were very adamant about 
us exercising those rights.”

In response to those criticiz-

ing the protest for its placement 
after the ceremony, Webb said 
the demonstration did not aim 
to take attention away from the 
graduates, but rather serve as a 
forum to both educate attendees 
and provide a voice for concerns 
with which many University 
students are grappling.

“We didn’t want to take 

away from graduation at all, 
but there’s a lot of Black grads 
in that crowd that are feeling 
these things, and it doesn’t just 
stop because things are happy.”

President to 

announce executive 
orders ahead of State 
of the Union address

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

President Barack Obama will 

visit Metro Detroit Wednesday 
as part of a three-city tour lead-
ing up to his State of the Union 
address, the Detroit Free Press 
reported Saturday afternoon.

Citing a statement by White 

House spokesperson Eric Schul-
tz, the Free Press reported 
Obama’s visit would highlight his 
administration’s 2009 efforts to 
bail out Michigan’s auto industry 
through a series of intentional 
bankruptcies and federal loans.

The statement also said his 

remarks 
would 
include 
the 

announcement of several legis-
lative proposals and executive 
orders.

No 
further 
details 
about 

Obama’s visit were available Sat-
urday. The White House did not 

immediately respond to a request 
for comment. There are no Mich-
igan events currently listed on 
the president’s public schedule 
for Wednesday.

Wednesday will mark the 

president’s second visit to Michi-
gan in recent months. In Novem-
ber, he spoke at Wayne State 
University to campaign for Dem-
ocratic candidates in a number 
of statewide elections. The auto 
bailout emerged as an issue dur-
ing this year’s fall election season 
and was also highlighted during 
the president’s November visit.

Vigil honors Pakistani 
students slain in attack

Over 100 gather to 
remember people 
killed by Taliban

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

As part of a candlelight vigil 

honoring lives lost in Tuesday’s 
Taliban attack on the Army Pub-
lic School and Degree College 
in Peshawar, Pakistan, over 100 
members of the University com-
munity gathered on the Diag 
Wednesday evening to reflect on 
the recent violence in the coun-
try.

In the Taliban’s most recent 

attack on Pakistani schools, 148 
people were killed — 132 of which 
were children — and at least a 
hundred more hospitalized with 
injuries.

At the vigil, which was orga-

nized by the Michigan Pakistanis 
and the Muslim Students’ Associ-
ation, many of the students stood 
on the Hatcher Graduate Library 

stairs holding Pakistani flags and 
signs reading, “The smallest cof-
fins are the heaviest,” “Today we 
bleed together” and “#PrayFor-
Peshawar.” At the bottom of the 
steps candles were arranged to 
spell “Peshawar.”

Before student leaders shared 

their thoughts on the events, the 
group was silent for 10 minutes of 
reflection. Most of the speakers 
were of Pakistani heritage and 
several spoke of personal experi-
ences dealing with violence in the 
country.

“It’s amazing to see all the 

solidarity,” said MSA President 
Saher Rathur, an LSA senior. 
“People of all ethnicities attend-
ed the event to show their sup-
port for Pakistan.”

Many of the speakers dis-

cussed their hope that the media 
does not define all of Pakistan 
by these attacks. Speakers asked 
attendants to pray for Pakistan 
and the families affected by the 
attacks.

MPak 
President 
Mansoor 

Saqib, an LSA senior, said he 

hopes the media depicts these 
attacks with nuance.

“Instead we should focus 

on why this attack took place,” 
Saquib said. “What were the real 
political agendas of these groups 
or monsters? What is our govern-
ment and the Pakistani govern-
ment doing to perpetuate such 
violence? And more importantly, 
what can we as citizens of this 
world do to stop violent tragedies 
like this from frequently repeat-
ing?”

Following the vigil, organizers 

held a traditional funeral prayer 
in Mason Hall and prepared a 
card for attendees to sign and 
send to Peshawar.

LSA junior Haider Malik’s 

family lives in Peshawar and 
he attended school there before 
coming to Michigan for college. 
He said he hopes the United 
States does not react with force as 
it did in its response to the Sep-
tember 11 attacks.

“Let us not seek to respond 

to force with more force,” Malik 
said. “That’s not the answer.”

LSA senior Nadir Rehman reminds attendants never to conflate the oppressed with their oppressors at vigil for Peshawar

Divers search for crash 
remnants in Indonesia

ACHMAD IBRAHIM/AP

Divers from the National Search And Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) on a rubber boat conduct their search operation for 
the victims of AirAsia flight QZ 8501 at Java Sea, Indonesia.

European Union likely to 
 

continue with sanctions

EU divisions make 
measures against 
Russia difficult to 

overturn

PARIS (AP) — EU sanctions 

against Russia over the crisis in 
Ukraine are cutting both ways: 
hurting Russia as well as pinch-
ing some big European compa-
nies. 

But economic relief isn’t 

likely any time soon, diplomats 
and analysts say, since EU divi-
sions make the sanctions tough 
to overturn.

France, 
Germany, 
Russia 

and Ukraine are trying to set 
up talks next week in Astana, 
Kazakhstan, to ease the ten-
sions behind the punitive mea-
sures that, along with slumping 
oil prices and U.S. sanctions, 
have sent the ruble sinking. 

The sanctions, and Rus-

sian retaliation, have in turn 
squeezed corporate Europe — 
including banks, oil companies, 
machinery makers and food 
giants that do business with 
Russia.

European Union rules com-

plicate any attempt to modify 

the sanctions put into place last 
year amid the separatist vio-
lence in eastern Ukraine and 
after Russia’s annexation of 
Crimea. A unanimous decision 
by all 28 EU nations is needed 
to change the sanctions, and 
analysts say such unanimity 
doesn’t exist.

The main EU sanctions — 

which have hit Russian banks 
and oil companies and have 
banned arms exports and the 
export of dual-use goods — are 
in place until the end of July. A 
first review of some sanctions 
could come in March.

“We don’t turn any sanction 

screw just for the sake of turn-
ing,” German Chancellor Ange-
la Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen 
Seibert, told reporters Monday. 
“The sanctions are responses 
to concrete situations from the 
Russian side and concrete situ-
ations in eastern Ukraine.”

Under the combined blow 

of sanctions and slumping oil 
prices, the ruble has lost about 
half its value this year and the 
Russian economy has drifted 
into recession. 

President 
Vladimir 
Putin 

has promised the economy will 
rebound, but he has failed to 
offer a specific plan for easing 

Russia’s heavy dependence on 
oil and gas revenues.

Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow 

at the Bruegel think tank in 
Brussels, said France and Italy 
are among the nations more 
open to lifting the sanctions 
while Poland, Britain and the 
Baltic countries want to stand 
firm.

It’s not certain the talks 

scheduled for Jan. 15 in Astana 
will take place — diplomats say 
high-level 
preparatory 
talks 

are planned Friday. French 
President Francois Hollande 
told France-Inter radio that he 
would only attend the Astana 
talks if progress could be made 
in easing the tensions.

“The sanctions should be lift-

ed if there’s progress. If there’s 
no progress, the sanctions will 
remain,” he said Monday, add-
ing that Putin “of course is not 
letting on that he has the slight-
est difficulty.”

“The sanctions ... and the 

decrease of the oil price ... 
weaken him. 

He doesn’t say it of course, he 

doesn’t let people think that he 
has any kind of difficulty, but he 
has some difficulties.”

So do some European corpo-

rate titans.

Pieces from AirAsia 

crash discovered 

after weeks of 

recovery

PANGKALAN BUN, Indone-

sia (AP) — At least two divers 
plunged into the choppy waters 
early Wednesday during a break 
in the bad weather to search for 
two large objects suspected of 
being chunks of the fuselage of 
the AirAsia plane that crashed 
more than one week ago, an 
Indonesian official said.

A U.S. Navy ship, the USS 

Fort Worth, detected the lat-
est two objects on Tuesday at a 
depth of 28 meters (92 feet) near 
the Karimata Strait off Indone-
sia.

“We will start to identify the 

wreckage, which appears to be 
part of the jet’s body, as quickly 
as possible,” Indonesian search 
and rescue operation coordina-
tor Tatang Zainudin said, add-
ing that teams equipped with 
a remote-operated vehicle will 
also try to capture images of the 
objects.

So far, seven objects sus-

pected to be parts of the plane 
have been detected by sonar on 
the ocean floor, but strong cur-
rents, silt and mud have kept 
divers from seeing or reaching 
them.

Zainudin said the bad weath-

er that has held up the search 
was “frustrating.”

Two 
more 
bodies 
were 

retrieved Tuesday, bringing the 
total to 39. But there are con-
cerns that it will become harder 
to find the remaining corpses 
from Flight 8501, which crashed 
Dec. 28 with 162 passengers and 
crew aboard.

The crash has put a spotlight 

on Indonesia, where dozens of 
new airlines have popped up in 
recent years to meet booming 
demand, but a string of deadly 
accidents has raised concerns 
about safety.

Experts say poor mainte-

nance, 
rule-bending 
and 
a 

shortage of trained personnel 
are largely to blame. Infrastruc-
ture has also failed to keep pace 
with exploding demand.

The country’s transportation 

ministry said it was cracking 
down after it was discovered 
that Flight 8501 did not have a 
permit to fly between Surabaya, 
Indonesia, and Singapore on the 
day of the crash. 

It suspended two ministry 

officials and five workers at 
Surabaya’s main airport Tues-
day for allowing the flight. 
Others are still under investi-
gation.

All AirAsia flights on that 

route also have been canceled 
for the time being.

It is not known what caused 

the Airbus A320 to crash into 
the Java Sea 42 minutes after 
takeoff, 
though 
Indonesia’s 

Meteorology, Climatology and 
Geophysics Agency says bad 
weather appears to have been 
a factor.

Just before losing contact, 

the pilot told air traffic control 
he was approaching threat-
ening clouds, but was denied 
permission to climb to a higher 
altitude because of heavy air 
traffic. No distress signal was 
issued.

No pings have been detected 

from the plane’s all-important 
cockpit voice and flight data 
recorders. That’s because high 
waves 
have 
prevented 
the 

deployment of ships that drag 
ping locators. 

The batteries in the pingers 

on the black boxes are likely to 
go dead in about 20 more days.

“We are confident that res-

cuers would be able to locate 
them in time,” said Nurcahyo 
Utomo, an investigator for 
Indonesia’s National Commit-
tee on Transportation Safety.

The search for the remain-

ing bodies has been exhausting 
for family members anxiously 
waiting to identify and bury 
their loved ones.

Eight Islamic clerics flew in 

a helicopter over the site Tues-
day and scattered rice into 
the sea, a local tradition, and 
prayed for those who perished.

South Korea threatened by 
North Korean technology

Seoul’s Defense 
Ministry reports 
6,000-member N. 
Korean cyber army 

ISEOUL, South Korea (AP) 

— South Korea said Tuesday 
that rival North Korea has a 
6,000-member cyber army dedi-
cated to disrupting the South’s 
military and government, a dra-
matic increase from an earlier 
estimate of 3,000 such specialists.

Without elaborating, Seoul’s 

Defense Ministry also said in 
a report that North Korea may 

also have gained the ability to 
strike the U.S. mainland because 
of its progress in missile tech-
nology demonstrated in recent 
long-range missile tests. 

It also said North Korea is 

advancing in efforts to min-
iaturize nuclear warheads to 
mount on such missiles.

There is considerable mys-

tery, and outside debate, about 
the state of North Korea’s 
opaque nuclear and missile pro-
grams, which it has persisted 
in pursuing for decades despite 
widespread domestic poverty 
and heavy international sanc-
tions and criticism.

North Korea has conduct-

ed three nuclear tests since 
2006, the most recent in early 
2013, and experts believe it 
has a handful of crude nuclear 
bombs. 

Many 
outside 
observers 

speculate that it has not mas-
tered the technology to make 
the bombs small enough to 
put on long-range missiles, 
although some say it may be 
able to arm shorter-range mis-
siles with warheads.

North Korea has conducted 

several long-range rocket tests, 
which are seen as covers for 
banned tests meant to develop 
missiles that could hit main-
land American shores. 

North Korea says its launches 

are meant to put peaceful satel-
lites into orbit, and that its nuclear 

program is crucial to protecting 
itself from U.S. hostility.

The South Korean Defense 

Ministry 
report 
said 
North 

Korea’s 6,000 cyber warriors 
are dedicated to “paralyzing 
the South psychologically and 
materially” and have been con-
ducting cyberattacks to disrupt 
the South’s military operations 
and main government systems. 
It didn’t describe how it made its 
assessments.

The United States accuses 

North Korea of a cyberattack 
on Sony Pictures over a movie 
depicting the fictional assassina-
tion of the North’s leader, Kim 
Jong Un. 

Washington 
has 
slapped 

sanctions on government offi-
cials and North Korea’s defense 
industry. There are doubts in 
the cyber community, however, 
and North Korea has denied 
any involvement in the breach 
of tens of thousands of confi-
dential Sony emails and busi-
ness files.

Former South Korean Defense 

Minister Kim Kwan-jin said in 
2013 that North Korea was oper-
ating a cyberwarfare staff of 
3,000. 

South Korea accuses North 

Korea of conducting at least six 
high-profile cyberattacks since 
2007 and many more unsuc-
cessful attempts to infiltrate 
computer systems of businesses 
and government agencies.

Do you hear anyone laughing?
‘Interview’ fails 
to live up to hype

Rogen-Franco 
comedy short on 

laughs 

By CONRAD FOREMAN

Daily Arts Writer

With its release abruptly can-

celled amid a hacking controversy, 
“The Interview” became perhaps 
the most polar-
izing movie of 
the 
crowded 

holiday film sea-
son. Sadly, the 
tale of the film’s 
release is more 
compelling than 
the actual plot.

Of 
course, 

longtime writ-
ing and direct-
ing partners Seth Rogen and Evan 
Goldberg (“This is the End”) didn’t 
set out to tell a heart-wrenching 
story, but rather to simply make 
people laugh, and give a big middle 
finger to Kim Jong-un.

“The Interview” opens strongly 

with Dave Skylark (James Franco, 
“127 Hours”), famous celebrity-
interviewer, and his producer, 
Aaron Rapoport (Rogen), during 

an interview with rapper Eminem, 
resulting in the funniest scene of 
the entire film. Soon, it’s revealed 
that North Korean dictator Kim 
Jong-un is a big fan of Skylark, 
and requests that Skylark come 
to North Korea to interview the 
supreme leader for the exclusive of 
a lifetime. Seizing the opportunity 
to strike a vulnerable enemy, the 
CIA intervenes and assigns Sky-
lark and Rapoport the mission of 
assassinating Jong-un which they 
accept. However, when the pair 
arrives in the enigmatic country, 
they find that things aren’t what 
they expected. They have doubts 
about the integrity of the mission, 
and their plain bone-headedness 
jeopardizes the entire operation.

Given the hullabaloo surround-

ing the film, one would expect 
“The Interview” to incite more 
anti-North Korean sentiment than 
it does. While Kim Jong-un is cer-
tainly the bad guy, the plot goes to 
significant lengths to humanize 
him and even generate some sym-
pathy for his position — pressure 
from his father, insecurity in his 
masculinity, etc. During the cli-
mactic interview, Jong-un’s own 
dialogue even flips the script on 
audiences, as he recites facts that 
call the U.S.’s moral superiority into 
question.

Aside from the political tones of 

the film, “The Interview” means 
to garner laughs, which it does 
only mildly. In this regard, the film 
falls short of most of Rogen and 
Goldberg’s previous efforts, such 
as “Pineapple Express” (Rogen 
and Franco’s first film together 
as co-stars) and “Superbad.” Par-
ticularly unfunny is Franco, whose 
character’s humor stems from his 
stupidity and relies on dick jokes 
and ambiguously gay puns. The 
funniest sequences of the film 
come from minor roles — the afore-
mentioned Eminem interview and 
a short scene with Anders Holm 
(Ders from “Workaholics”), who 
belittles Rogen about the type of 
“news” he produces.

Ultimately, “The Interview” 

proves more silly than serious, 
an escapist comedic fantasy that 
incorporates elements of real 
geo-political conditions, rather 
than a dramatic epic that incor-
porates comedy. Only someone as 
oppressive as Kim Jong-un could 
view this film as a threat. The 
most interesting legacy of “The 
Interview” might be its reception 
among the few North Koreans 
who get a hold of a copy, though 
Western society will likely never 
know if that reception is favor-
able.

New option for non-
drinkers at Brillig

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

If you’re hoping for a fun night 

out without the typically embar-
rassing occurrences of a liquor-
soaked night, at long last, your 
wishes have been granted by Bril-
lig Dry Bar.

If you’ve never experienced the 

dry bar scene, just as I hadn’t, you 
might assume it to be similar to a 
restaurant or coffeehouse. I was 
also unsure of how those of legal 
age would respond to the non-
alcoholic principle. I expected the 
atmosphere to be just as dry as the 
bar, but the latest addition to Ann 
Arbor’s nightlife scene is modern 
and upbeat, while also alcohol-
free. One can enjoy him/herself 
at Brillig and leave without the 
regrets of drunken texts and Ins-
tagram posts.

Throughout 
the 
month 
of 

December, Brillig has hosted mul-
tiple pop-up events to introduce 
itself to Ann Arborites. Hosted in 
its daytime coffee shop, Mighty 
Good Coffee, Brillig is not a perma-
nent gathering place yet. However, 
its pop-up event on Dec. 26 boasted 

a buzzing crowd with a line out the 
door, foreshadowing a promising 
future for the unconventional bar 
concept.

As a viable alternative to both 

the late-night coffeehouse and bar 
scenes, Brillig is essentially the res-
urrection of the soda fountain, yet 
it caters to the new-age customer. 
Structured similarly to Mighty 
Good, customers order at the coun-
ter, then their food and beverage 
orders are called out for pickup. 
Seating ranges from couches, the 
bar and high and low tables. The 
eclectic décor, with bikes strung 
from the ceiling with various maps 
to educate customers on coffee pro-
duction, adds to its unpretentious, 
homey diner vibe.

Unlike the usual bar scene, Bril-

lig’s energy is sophisticated, not 
inebriated. It’s loud, but the noise 
is categorized by the pleasant 
cadences of everyday life — friends 
and families greeting and catching 
up, with a live band adding sooth-
ing sounds of light jazz in the back-
ground.

In addition to the usual fare of 

Mighty Good Coffee beverages, 
the drink menu ranges from the 

popular Brooklyn Egg Cream to 
the Cranberry Sour that I sampled, 
a deliciously tart and sweet con-
coction of Michigan-made Ver-
nors and cranberry juice.

Brillig also caters to snack 

cravings, with its pastry case and 
menu of small plates — snack trays 
of cheeses and fruits, meats and 
mustards and the winter cookie 
sampler.

As a Michigander through and 

through, my usual hangout spot 
has been Coney Island since I 
was approximately 12 years old. 
Though Ann Arbor never ceases 
to amaze me with its seemingly 
endless selection of restaurant 
and nightlife options, I was always 
homesick for my familiar diner 
scene. Yet after my positive experi-
ence at Brillig, I now hope to fre-
quent the kitschy hotspot.

Brillig fits in seamlessly to the 

city, as it’s everything Ann Arbor 
is: casual, clean and conceptually 
innovative. Though Brillig may be 
overlooked by college students at 
first glance, it’s a nice alternative 
to the standard collegiate night 
out, without wreaking havoc on 
your liver.

That’s not how you ride a motorcycle!
Minaj reveals mature 
sound on ‘Pinkprint’

Nicki Minaj bucks 
hip-hop trends on 
her third release 

By ADAM THEISEN

Senior Arts Editor

Nicki Minaj became a legend 

before she even dropped an album. 
Back in 2010, she stole the spot-
light 
on 
one 

of the biggest, 
greatest 
rap 

albums of all-
time, 
produc-

ing the furious, 
instant-classic, 
schizoid 32 bars 
that 
defined 

Kanye 
West’s 

“Monster” (off 
My 
Beautiful 

Dark Twisted Fantasy). Not only 
that, she spent the start of her 
career making relatively bland 
top-40 radio hits infinitely better, 
going on an unprecedentedly kill-
er run of guest verses that would 
showcase her seemingly unlim-
ited drive and talent, blast loudly 
at high-school dances and induce 
nostalgia today.

Unfortunately, 
Minaj’s 
first 

album, Pink Friday, was a disap-
pointment. A few strong verses 
here and there were overwhelmed 
by bland pop songs. While there 
were obviously plenty of incentives 
($$$) to go for hits, all of Minaj’s 
character was lost in the meander-
ing tracks (bonus-track-turned-
surprise-smash 
“Super 
Bass” 

notwithstanding).

Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded 

seemed to fix that problem. The 
delirious weirdness of “Come on a 
Cone” and the legit hip hop of “Beez 
in the Trap” found a comfortable 
home next to sugary pop numbers. 
Minaj’s sophomore release struck a 
perfect balance between all facets 
of her personality.

Minaj’s new record, The Pink-

print upsets that diverse balance 
a little bit, but all in the name of 
artistic evolution. It’s more sub-
dued, developed and mature, and 
it’s definitely a must-hear release. 
At 60-plus minutes (even longer 

with bonus tracks), it’s a beast of an 
album, a sprawling work that pres-
ents one of today’s strongest, most 
versatile artists in a creative sweet 
spot. Minaj never lets up or coasts 
throughout the entire album, and 
she delivers a new high for an 
already impressive career.

Opening track “All Things Go” 

is a stark beginning, with Minaj 
getting deeply personal right off 
the bat. She raps about her teen-
age pregnancy and abortion and 
the shooting death of her little 
cousin, starting the album with 
sober, powerful words that make 
you take a deep breath when the 
track ends. The production on “All 
Things Go” and many of The Pink-
print’s other tracks recalls Drake’s 
Nothing Was the Same. The dron-
ing keyboards and slow tempos 
evoke a dreamy, reflective mood, 
though instead of Drake’s often 
drug-induced haze we get Minaj’s 
more wistful remembrances.

The Pinkprint starts to accelerate 

after the first few songs, and really 
gets into gear once the guest stars 
show up. Track four, “Get On Your 
Knees,” is a solid, well-produced 
pop song, even if perpetual-preteen 
Ariana Grande still seems way too 
young to be singing what she’s sing-
ing. And then things really turn 
up on the subsequent song, “Feel-
ing Myself.” The absolutely stellar 
dream team of Minaj, Beyoncé and 
Hit-Boy (can you even imagine a 
better pop-music trio?) join forces 
to produce a more-than-worthy 
follow-up to “***Flawless (Remix).” 
Wrapping themselves in a blan-
ket of utter coolness, Hit-Boy once 
again pushes boundaries with 
his heavy, sway-inducing instru-
mental, Minaj fires off lines like 
machine gun rounds and Yoncé lit-
erally stops the world for a moment 
before allowing us all to carry on.

Elsewhere, Dr. Luke handles a 

plurality of the production duties. 
Putting recent unsettling allega-
tions aside, the hitmaking super-
producer does exactly what he’s 
supposed to do and does it well. He 
brings a sparse, chilly beat to the 
recent single “Only,” which show-
cases a confident-as-always Minaj 
but also contains a juvenile verse 
from Drake, some uninspiring bars 

from (still relevant!) Lil Wayne and 
Chris Brown, for some reason. Dr. 
Luke also pilots the formulaic-but-
catchy “The Night Is Still Young,” 
with its M83-esque chorus and 
fierce Minaj verses, and first single 
“Pills n Potions.” The beginning 
of the album’s comedown, “Pills 
n Potions” would be a typical 
slow-burn lighter-waver in most 
hands, but Minaj elevates it with 
her meaningful lyrics and emo-
tional delivery, creating a hip-hop 
“Someone Like You” that’s sweet 
and wistful with a shade of dark-
ness layered in.

Hm, am I forgetting anything? 

Oh yeah, just “Anaconda,” one of 
the craziest, most talked about 
songs of the year. In a party-
starting, furiously chaotic career 
highlight, 
Minaj 
subverts 
the 

misogynistic rap classic “Baby Got 
Back,” turning it into an empower-
ing celebration of her own sexual-
ity. Almost all of Minaj’s work on 
The Pinkprint is more subdued than 
in her early days when she tore 
“Monster” to shreds like a hungry 
lioness would devour a zebra, but 
“Anaconda” brings back the unpre-
dictable maniac Minaj, and my god 
is it glorious.

2014 was certainly not the year 

of the hip-hop album. Aside from 
probably ScHoolboy Q, there were 
no huge album releases this year, 
with most rappers electing instead 
to release material as quickly as 
possible over the Internet, or not 
release anything at all (looking 
at you, Yeezy). But Nicki Minaj 
changes everything. At over an 
hour long, The Pinkprint is almost 
impossible to swallow whole in 
the Internet era, but even on a 
track-by-track basis the work is 
still stellar. Minaj is confident and 
impenetrable, not failing once 
while taking even more artistic 
risks. On the last track, “Grand 
Piano,” she even brings a beautiful 
singing voice out of nowhere. Even 
if the song gets a little schmaltzy, 
it’s just so impressive that Minaj 
continues 
to 
achieve 
success 

beyond her audience’s high expec-
tations. As fantastic as she is, she’s 
still continuing to grow as an art-
ist, and I already can’t wait to hear 
what comes next.

Sid the Sloth? Really?!
‘Imitation Game’ 
takes few chances 

Historical 

drama sidesteps 

controversial themes

By ZAK WITUS

Daily Arts Writer

Richard Lewis, my “Introduc-

tion to Cognitive Science” profes-
sor, might blush 
when he reads 
the 
follow-

ing 
anecdote. 

In lecture last 
semester, while 
introducing our 
class to Alan 
Turing, whom 
many 
praise 

as the founder 
of 
computer 

science 
and 

computational 
theory, Rick suddenly stopped his 
perpetual pacing and his voice 
dropped out. All of us in the lec-
ture hall stopped scribbling and 
typing and raised our heads. Rick’s 
eyes welled up with tears. “See, 
Alan Turing was gay,” he said. 
Now, you might be thinking: “that 
Richard Lewis is a terrible, preju-
diced, homophobic bastard!” but 
Rick wasn’t crying because Tur-
ing was gay. Rick got all weepy 
because even after Turing’s scien-
tific breakthroughs, which we still 
talk about today (e.g., my philoso-
phy professor this semester (Win-
ter 2015) just assigned our class 
Turing’s 1950 paper, “Computing 
Machinery and Intelligence” for 
Thursday), and even after helping 
break the Nazi encryption code — 
the infamous “Enigma Machine” 
— the British government arrest-
ed, tried and convicted Turing 
of “indecency,” or, simply being 
gay. Rick explained that the Brit-
ish court offered Turing a choice: 
chemical castration or two years 
in prison. Turing chose the for-
mer, and then, after one year of 
hormone therapy, he committed 
suicide.

“The Imitation Game” tells the 

same story but with the grand 
gesticulation 
and 
technicolor 

pathos of a film with the name of 
another man on its mind: Oscar. 
As they sometimes say about good 
film actors, “The Imitation Game” 
hit every mark. The filmmakers 
did what they thought would win 
the affection of the Academy: they 
had the actors spiel pseudo-wis-
dom that viewers could recite on 
their drive home from the theater; 
they told a story using the two 
big Oscar buzzwords (gay and 
war); and they told a story that’s 
exoterically enjoyable but makes 
you feel smart and sophisticated. 

That’s not to say that it’s a bad 
film, because it’s not. By dress-
ing itself up in the generic Oscar 
garments, “The Imitation Game” 
ends up looking pretty good. But 
by imitating greatness instead of 
creating it itself, the film is just 
mediocre — which people often 
think means “bad,” but actually 
just means “medium.”

Though Turing was, as they say 

in the film, a “poofter,” the film’s 
depiction of Turing is not homo-
sexual enough. The film appro-
priately doesn’t depict Turing’s 
gayness with as much flamboy-
ant fabulousness as, say, “Paris is 
Burning.” On the other hand, the 
film shows almost none of Tur-
ing’s gay behavior. The emphatic 
absence of romance between 
Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch, 
“Star Trek Into Darkness”) and 
Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley, 
“Pirates of the Caribbean”) makes 
sense in this film, especially 
because Hollywood audiences 
would typically expect a hot, sexy 
romance 
between 
Knightley’s 

and Cumberbatch’s characters. 
But it’s worth pausing over the 
fact that though this violation of 
our expectation serves the gay 
theme on the surface we still get 
to gawk and drool over the heart-
wrenchingly gorgeous Knightley. 
IEssentially, the film (again) is too 
hetero, and Clarke/Knightley’s 
sexiness, instead of just echo-
ing down the empty corridors of 
Turing’s homosexual desire, also 
resonates with the heterosexual 
male audience’s libidinous (ahem) 
“tuning fork.”

Despite being frequently mis-

taken for Sid the Sloth from the 
“Ice Age” saga, Cumberbatch 
has the perfect face for this 
character and he manipulates 
it 
masterfully. 
Cumberbatch 

adopts a refined countenance 
that conveys the depth of Tur-
ing’s intelligence even when he 
isn’t speaking. He’s had plenty 
of practice making the smart-
guy face on his television show 
“Sherlock.” 
Throughout 
the 

film, his face often evokes that 
peculiar feeling you sometimes 
experience when conversing 
with an exceptionally intelli-
gent individual — which, now 

that I think of it, is just the feel-
ing of someone actually listen-
ing to you. As in real life, we 
respond to Turing’s (i.e., Cum-
berbatch’s) careful listening by 
listening more carefully our-
selves. Turing’s attentive gaze 
and bright eyes make us realize 
that we’re dealing with a formi-
dable intelligence, but, before 
Turing verbally responds to 
who or what he’s attending to, 
we don’t know what that intel-
ligence is currently calculating 
or computing, so we lean in fur-
ther. Cumberbatch completes 
his construction of the (ahem) 
“enigma” that is Alan Turing by 
adding in nervous twitches and 
stuttering, thus transforming 
what might otherwise be, and 
often still is, an arrogant and 
narcissistic English professor 
into an endearingly awkward 
but exceptionally brilliant war 
hero.

As previously mentioned, the 

film riffs on two of modern Holly-
wood’s most popular themes: gay 
identity and war. But we have to 
ask: What image of war does this 
film project? What message about 
war does it try to convey? Just as 
the film avoids direct contact with 
Turing’s gayness, it also avoids 
direct contact with war. Just as 
we see (virtually) no gay romance 
or sexuality, we also see no bloodi-
ness, brutality or violence. (The 
most physically violent image is 
a firm shoulder bump that sends 
the feeble Turing to the floor.) The 
absence of physical violence serves 
the film’s subject matter: The film 
has no superfluous pretenses about 
the kind of war film it’s trying to 
be. It’s the kind of war film where 
the most violent image (physical, 
psychological or otherwise) is the 
unplugging of the code-breaking 
computer.

But it’s worth noting how 

war is present in the movie as it 
is in the consciousness of most 
Americans — a mere abstrac-
tion — and therefore it doesn’t 
present us with any sights or 
sounds that could potentially 
challenge or offend our soci-
ety’s “civilized” (i.e., dull) sen-
sibilities. Even with Turing’s 
gayness, which serves as a cor-
nerstone of this film, we don’t 
see much of his suffering (e.g., 
his hormone therapy). In short, 
“The Imitation Game” doesn’t 
challenge its audience enough: 
By avoiding the naked reality 
of Turing’s gay identity as well 
as World War II, the film avoids 
too much of its potentially 
very upsetting and hence very 
controversial subject in favor 
of appealing to a wider PG-13 
audience.

Daily Book Review: 
Endearing ‘Janice’

Refreshing cop 
novel humanizes 

the NYPD

By KATHLEEN DAVIS

Senior Arts Editor

In an intensely polarizing 

year, it’s hard to find a subject 
more relevant than attitudes 
towards police. Between the 
shootings of Michael Brown 
and Tamir Rice (among others) 
and protests for “Black Lives 
Matter” as well as pro-police 
“Blue Lives Matter,” it seems as 
though everyone has an opinion 
regarding the role of cops in the 
United States. Whether your 
recent thoughts toward the boys 
in blue have been critical or 
defending, it’s important to step 
back and realize one universal 
truth: when it comes down to 
it, policemen are just everyday 
people. There are going to be 
good ones and there are going 
to be bad ones, and sometimes 
it takes one appropriately timed 
book to bring this to light.

“Uncle Janice,” the sopho-

more novel by Matt Burgess 
(“Dogfight, a Love Story”), is 
a refreshing cop novel featur-

ing an unlikely yet necessary 
hero: Janice Itwaru, a mixed 
race, take-no-shit young police-
woman from Queens. It’s Jan-
ice’s attitude toward her career 
choice, motivated substantially 
by both the need to support her 
dementia-stricken mother and 
her childhood love of superhe-
roes, that allows the reader to 
step back from recent good cop 
versus bad cop dialogues and 
view the profession from a sub-
jective point of view.

Janice’s role in the NYPD is 

that of an “uncle,” an undercover 
cop who tries to buy drugs off the 
street so her backups can arrest 
the dealer for possession charges. 
It’s a dangerous job, and Janice is 
quite literally dying to become a 
detective, a job that requires a cer-
tain amount of “buys” off dealers 
before she can be promoted. Jan-
ice wants to be a detective more 
than anything, and “Uncle Janice” 
follows the titular character as she 
pushes through adversity from her 
co-workers to make her last buys. 
This is all while navigating dan-
gerous drug slingers, her personal 
life and her deteriorating sanity.

Burgess’s portrayal of work-

ing class New York City pro-
vides a view unseen in popular 
works like “Sex and the City” or 

“The Wolf of Wall Street.” This 
city is a community of working-
class people trying to get by, 
and sometimes that means tak-
ing on a dangerous career that 
requires no college education, 
like a cop or drug dealer.

The witty internal mono-

logue Burgess gives to Janice 
allows the reader to melt into 
her world, as one could be lis-
tening to a friend as she trashes 
her colleagues after a long day 
of work or explains how her lack 
of a boyfriend is due to the time 
commitment her job requires. 
Janice Itwaru isn’t a typical 
narrator, but that’s what makes 
her character so believable and 
endearing — even when her 
decision-making skills lead her 
into cringe-worthy situations. 
Like a real person, Janice has 
good qualities and bad ones, 
and she makes both good and 
bad decisions. The reader fol-
lows her through the realiza-
tion that she may or may not be 
an alcoholic like her father and 
that she may be falling prey to 
the same early onset dementia 
as her mother. “Uncle Janice” 
may be primarily a cop novel, 
but its strength lies in the fact 
that this is a novel about people, 
and realistic ones at that.

Do you know how hard it is to act with all this makeup on?
Dark ‘Foxcatcher’ a 
Freudian nightmare

Strong performances 

fill character-
driven drama

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editor

Bennett Miller’s “Foxcatcher” 

derives little of its suspense from 
the climactic spoiler the entire audi-
ence knows is coming. As it should 
— the 1996 trial 
of 
paranoid-

schizophrenic 
John du Pont 
held 
national 

interest because 
of its titillating 
combination 
of 
American 

aristocracy and 
Olympic lore. On 
the 
cinematic 

stage, it plays out a more psycholog-
ical brand of strife: brother against 
brother, father figure against father 
figure.

The brothers of “Foxcatcher” 

are Mark and Dave Schulz, two 
Olympic 
gold-medalist 
wres-

tlers. Post-victory, Mark (Chan-
ning Tatum, “Magic Mike”) lives 
in moderate poverty, training all 
day before returning to his dim 
apartment to eat Ramen and play 
Nintendo in solitude. In contrast, 
older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo, 
“The Avengers”) has a successful 
coaching career and a loud, happy 
family no doubt aided by his easy 
charisma, which Mark holds in 
taciturn resentment. So when, out 
of the blue, billionaire John du Pont 
(Steve Carell, “The Office”) of the 
eponymous pharmaceutical com-
pany (and fortune) offers to sponsor 
Mark’s training at his Foxcatcher 
training center, he takes it up with-

out any hesitation. Mark, with his 
clumsy muteness, isn’t a personable 
character, but his immediate and 
childlike trust pangs the audience’s 
heart.

Du Pont is the dwindling end of 

the du Pont family line: with no role 
in the company and an endless sup-
ply of money, he lives in the sprawl-
ing estate with his domineering 
WASP mother, who together, live 
out — surprise! — a veritable knot of 
Freudian neuroses. Du Pont isn’t a 
good coach or wrestler; he has more 
money than sense, along with a 
bevy of substance problems. How-
ever, he longs to exert a paternal 
influence over the fatherless Mark. 
Du Pont eventually lures Dave to 
coach the Olympic-hopeful Fox-
catcher team. From here, the duel-
ing personalities drive the second 
half’s tension, as Mark struggles 
to emerge from his brother’s influ-
ence, and John sucks Dave into a 
petty, unrequited rivalry.

In “Foxcatcher,” the sport of 

wrestling is stripped from its patri-
otic residue. Sure, Mark and du 
Pont laud it as the embodiment of 
America’s noble, patriarchal values, 
but their wistful reminiscences feel 
as outmoded as the du Pont family. 
This isn’t “Rocky,” where boxing’s 
potent masculinity is the saving 
grace for an outsider. Here, wres-
tling chisels away at all respites to 
the outside world, until its protago-
nists teeter on an unsustainable 
sliver.

It’s the exquisitely directed 

scenes that illustrate just what an 
animalistic and low (as du Pont’s 
mother puts it) sport it is. In one 
scene, Mark pins down his oppo-
nent, whose legs release spastic 
tremors like an agitated animal in 
its death throes.

This is in contrast to the train-

ing scenes, which feel balletic 

in their choreography. They’re 
important because they work out 
Mark’s intensely physical char-
acter, the type of man who feels 
through doing. In an early scene 
with Dave, their well-practiced 
movements glide from broth-
erly intimacy into tempestuous 
spates of simmering resentment. 
Needless to say, Tatum’s atten-
tion to detail is remarkable in his 
performances — Mark is mental-
ly slow and quiet, but never flat. 
Ruffalo brands Dave with his 
signature sincerity, saturating 
him with all the natural charm 
and likeability that overshadows 
his younger brother.

Perhaps it’s because du Pont 

receives little respective charac-
terization that his role is stagnant. 
While prosthetics and makeup 
transform Carell’s personable face 
into a creepy mask, his performance 
is Michael Scott on ego-maniacal 
overdrive. In real life, paranoia and 
schizophrenia probably drove du 
Pont to murder Dave, but in “Fox-
catcher,” 
deep-seated 
mommy 

issues and jealousy are positioned 
as the unsatisfying motives.

As it stands, a quieter ending 

would have better fit “Foxcatch-
er” ’s modus operandi for the bulk 
of the film: to telescope the imper-
ceptible, unstable and familial 
politics of the trio. The film is 
threaded with Miller’s skillfully 
composed glimpses, which illus-
trate du Pont’s power maneuvers. 
In one scene, du Pont’s lawyer 
prods Mark with a series of ques-
tions, like whether he owns prop-
erty, when his parents divorced 
and who raised him, that method-
ically reveal Mark’s isolation. But 
for this nuanced and un-theatri-
cal atmosphere Miller superbly 
crafts, that final gunshot is too 
loud, too disruptive.

My Cultural Currency: Commercial Christmas

D

espite the fact that I 
belong to a long line of 
practicing Hindus, I 

am, surprisingly, a big fan of the 
holiday season — in particular, 
Christmas. 

You’d think I’d be uncomfort-

able at the sight of predominant 
Christian imagery and music dur-
ing this time of year. But I take it 
in stride. 

I’ve bought into the commer-

cial hype of Christmas. Maybe it’s 
the result of living in the United 
States for so long, but as soon as 
my calendar shifts to December 
my entire demeanor changes.

I’m in it for the aesthetic appeal, 

for the very fact that everything 
just looks prettier around the fes-
tive time of year. Mall and home 
décor — considering the amount 
of tinsel and sparkles that occupy 
every corner — look like they’ve 
been blessed by the ghost of Lib-
erace. 

It seems as if, almost overnight, 

I turn into an ugly-sweater-wear-
ing, Vanilla-Bean-Noel-smelling, 
compulsive 
candy-cane-eating 

version of myself. 

I know Christmas is a sig-

nificant and auspicious time for 
Christians, but I guiltily get excit-
ed just at the prospect of listen-
ing to Wham! and Mariah Carey 
Christmas tunes 24/7 without 
judgment.

December is my moment. It’s 

what I’ve been waiting for since 
practically the day after Christ-
mas the year before.

I can blast my Christmas Spo-

tify playlist, appropriately titled 
“YAS CHRISTMAS YAS,” and 
put on an elaborate one-woman 
lip-sync performance of “Baby It’s 
Cold Outside” — which is ordered 
four times consecutively in the 

playlist — without the intense, 
burning shame that usually fol-
lows when I do the same thing in 
the middle of July. 

As an outsider from another 

faith, even the commercial build-
up around Christmas can’t avoid 
reminding me about the true 
meaning of the holiday. Believe 
me, I’m aware that Christmas is 
about family, charity and worship. 

Diwali, the festival of lights, is a 

particularly important holiday for 
Hindu families, where, in a man-
ner similar to Christmas, loved 
ones make an effort to spend time 
together. During the holiday, fam-

ilies will decorate their houses 
with lights — again, like Christ-
mas — and eat special, celebratory 
meals. 

But, because of the relatively 

small Hindu community here, I 
haven’t been able to enjoy Diwali 
the way it’s mean to be celebrated. 
There are no light-adorned hous-
es in the middle of October, no 
Diwali songs playing on the radio 
and no special ABC Family movie 
countdown. 

It’s just another October. And 

although it’s irrational — con-
sidering Hinduism is a minority 
religion in America — the lack of 
awareness never fails to disap-
point me. 

Because my own religion isn’t 

practiced as widely in the U.S. 
as Christianity, communal cel-
ebrations of big festivals such as 
Diwali have been missing for the 
majority of my life. 

Christmas is a national phe-

nomenon and by partaking in the 
hype around Christmas — the 
ridiculously-decorated 
houses, 

the red Starbucks cups — I feel 
like I make up for Diwali’s lack of 
festivity for myself. 

It’s comforting to know that 

when I’m jamming out to “Last 
Christmas” and starting on my 
15th box of candy canes, the rest 
of America is doing the same. 

And I don’t feel so alone.

Welcome to The Statement.

T

wo months ago, a can of 
beer was thrown from 
the second floor of a 

fraternity house that will remain 
unnamed. Said beer can hap-
pened to find my head, and while 
the bruise healed, my motivation 
to #turnup has remained a little 
weak these days. 

Early in December, a new bar 

hosted its soft opening, and it 
was packed. Every two weeks at 
Mighty Good Coffee, this pop-up 
event draws people from all over 
Ann Arbor to its non-alcoholic 
bar. 

It is safe to say the organizers 

of Brillig Dry Bar are not aiming 
to attract undergraduates on a 
Saturday night, but as a 19-year-
old living in a world where under-
age drinking is not only common 
but expected, having a social 
experience that doesn’t involve 
sweaty frat bros, Natty Light, 
skin-tight skirts in the middle 
of December or the lonely, emo-
tional hangover that follows is 
rare, and the whole idea sounded 
pretty rad to me. 

Frankly, it’s classy. And while I 

might read George Elliot and Jane 
Austen for Intro to Victorian Lit-
erature, my regular mono-meals 
of Swedish Fish and the credit 
card bill I got last week filled with 
Pizza House entries don’t indi-
cate I do much classy shit. 

So this got me thinking. Ann 

Arbor is one of the best college 
towns in the nation, if not the 
best, and I rarely see it. When 
Ann Arbor is relatively student-
free over breaks and summers, 
townies jump for joy. But why?

If we never leave South U. and 

State St., we might never find out. 
I know that it’s a place of hippies 
and killer food, that it retains a 
small-town feel while offering 

some of the perks of a city and that 
weed has been decriminalized for 
years, but what exactly does the 
off-campus scene have to offer?

Alcohol and substance abuse 

at the University of Michigan — 
the campus of work hard, play 
hard — is a problem, and I’m 
definitely not the only one who 

thinks this way. The Uni-
versity cut Welcome Week 
short this year for a rea-
son, and according to the 
National College Health 
Assessment, 70 percent 
of undergraduates con-
sumed alcohol in the past 
month and of those, nearly 
half did something they 
regretted in the past year. 
Not to mention the 18 per-
cent of students who had 
unprotected sex. 

But it’s more than the 

numbers. It’s someone’s 
abortion story that will 

stay with them forever. It’s a 
ruined friendship resulting from 
a drunken mistake. It’s the need 
for an emotional crutch — a.k.a. 
alcohol. 

So, it’s events like a non-alco-

holic bar — away from the party 
mentality — that have an unusu-
al sense of freshness. Where 

I can sip on a Vernors Cran-
berry Sour wearing an entirely 
mismatched patterned outfit, 
discussing the next Ferguson 

meeting scheduled downtown 
or Michigan’s win in the GLI 
final. It’s the diversity of people 
at these kinds of events — events 
that just scream Ann Arbor — 
that is so attractive, and it’s the 
opportunity to engage in conver-
sation with a clear mind in a new 
and unusual environment that 
will keep me coming back. 

In this column and over the 

coming semester, I plan to see 
what makes the real Ann Arbor 
tick. Off-campus events — what 
it means to live off-campus and 
what your neighborhood says 
about you, new restaurants, old 
restaurants, the people who make 
Ann Arbor what it is, and what 
it would mean for students to 
engage in their town as invested 
citizens. 

As I write this, watching my 

childhood best friend twist open 
another Smirnoff Ice, I resolve to 
enjoy all that the college experi-
ence has to offer, but also to allow 
myself to resist succumbing to the 
expectation of perpetual intoxi-
cation — one might throw around 
the phrase binge drinking — for 
the refreshing, unusual, poten-
tially 
pretentious, 
innovative 

offerings residential Ann Arbor 
presents.

Wednesday, January 7, 2015 // The Statement 
5B

Since he graduated from the Uni-

versity of Michigan in May 2014, Louis 
Mirante has hitchhiked via cargo ship 
in the Maldives, attended a class taught 
by the Dalai Lama on Tibetan Buddhism 
and spent a month living in Chile.

Before Easter, the LSA graduate plans 

to live in Southern India for a month or 
more before he heads to Northern India 
and, most likely, to Nepal to live and 
teach at a monastery.

Mirante is traveling the world, but not 

on his own dime: he is a part of the inau-
gural class of the LSA Bonderman Trav-
el Fellowship, and was given $20,000 
to travel the world for eight months or 
more.

Piloted with the class of 2014, the LSA 

Bonderman Travel Fellowship grants 
four LSA graduates each year the chance 
to travel the world. They can go wher-
ever they want, when they want for eight 
months or more.

The only restrictions?
Fellows must travel independently 

and can only be with friends or family 
from home or a travel group for up to 10 
days. They must go to at least two regions 
of the world and six countries, and are 
discouraged from traveling to western-
ized countries, including Australia, New 
Zealand, Canada and nations in West-
ern Europe.

2014 LSA graduates Tyler Mesman, 

Erin Busbee, Ashline Hermiz and Louis 
Mirante make up the first class of fel-
lows, selected from a pool of about 100 
applicants in the spring of 2014.

Since leaving the U.S. on or by Aug. 

31, collectively, they have traveled to 
Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Peru, 
Bolivia, Croatia, Hungary, Jordan, Tur-
key, Cyprus, Zimbabwe, South Africa, 
India, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, 
Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Malaysia.

The program is the brainchild of 

David Bonderman, an investment advis-
er and businessman who graduated in 
1963 from the University of Washing-
ton, which has hosted a similar program 
for about two decades.

After 
graduating 
from 
Harvard 

University’s law school, Bonderman 
received a Sheldon Fellowship, which 
gave him the opportunity to travel the 
globe. The experience had such a pro-
found impact on his life that he was 

inspired to start the Bonderman Travel 
Fellowship at the University of Wash-
ington in 1995. Today, Washington’s 
Bonderman fellowship is awarded to 
seven undergraduates and seven gradu-
ate students each year.

Bonderman’s daughter and her hus-

band are both University graduates, and 
it was their idea to start the fellowship in 
Bonderman’s name. Plans for the pilot 
program began in September 2013, and 
the first class of fellows was notified in 
April 2014.

Mesman, who is from Grand Rapids, 

began his travels in Istanbul on Aug. 25 
and has since gone to Turkey, Cyprus, 
Zimbabwe, South Africa and, for the 
past month, India. He originally planned 
on going to Israel as well, but had to 
change his plans after it was placed on 
the University travel restriction list.

Which brings up another program 

rule: fellows cannot visit anywhere that 
is restricted according to the Universi-
ty’s Travel Warning and Travel Restric-
tion Destinations. When they applied to 
the program, all applicants submitted 
a sample itinerary, and must work with 
Rachel Reuter, the University’s Center 
for Global and Intercultural Study’s 
Health & Safety Coordinator, to ensure 
their final itinerary is realistic and 
doable.

In recent years, two Washington 

Bonderman fellows have died abroad 
— Jennifer Caldwell traveled with the 
Fellowship in 2007 and died in a 2009 
car accident in South Africa, and Alena 
Suazo was travelling with the fellow-
ship in Guatemala when became ill and 
died in 2011. Jordan said they encour-
age fellows to extensively research any 
place they plan to travel to, and fellows 
must e-mail the CGIS office every other 
week with updates on their whereabouts. 
Additionally, if fellows want to make 
changes to their approved itinerary after 
the program begins, these changes must 
be approved by CGIS.

“It’s a hands off program,” Reuter 

said. “But we’re certainly there if they 
need it.”

After India, Mesman plans on going 

to Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and Viet-
nam. He also wants to try to go to Burma 
and Laos.

“Each country and culture has its 

own surprises that come along with it 
and eventually you kind of learn to go 
with the flow,” Mesman wrote in an 
e-mail — Internet where he was staying 
in India was not strong enough to sup-
port a video call. “I have actually been 
more surprised by how similar people 
are rather than the differences. I’ve been 
surprised by the culture shocks between 
each country though — going from Tur-
key to Zimbabwe is quite the physical 
and cultural leap. I don’t have the oppor-
tunity to go back to the U.S. and push the 
‘cultural reset button’.”

In addition to the basic stipulations, 

Bonderman fellows budget their travels 
themselves. They are given $8,000 up 
front, and starting one month after they 
leave the United States, they are given 
$1,500 a month. Within their budget, 
they must purchase University travel 
insurance.

Reuter said managing a budget is part 

of what makes the program a great learn-
ing experience. $20,000 may seem like a 
lot, but over eight months expenses can 
add up fast.

“Seeking out things that they wouldn’t 

typically do if they had more money is 
part of the experience,” Reuter said.

Hermiz said she was initially very 

careful about budgeting her money, but 
has found that travel is cheaper than she 
expected.

“In the beginning I thought $1,000 

per country would be appropriate,” she 
wrote in an e-mail.

Hermiz has been to Turkey, Croatia, 

Hungary, Jordan, Cambodia and Malay-
sia.

“I have found that I spend much less 

than that and I really pay attention to 
ways of saving money as well as when it 
is OK to splurge,” she said.

During the first application cycle 

for the program, around 100 seniors 
applied. A selection committee consist-
ing of CGIS staff and faculty reviewed 
18 finalists, and nine candidates were 
interviewed. CGIS director Michael 
Jordan said they hope to expand the pro-
gram gradually in the future, although 
Bonderman’s daughter and her husband 
plan to keep it as an undergraduate LSA 
program.

Jordan said they look for students 

who haven’t had significant internation-

al travel or study abroad experiences, 
who are open to new experiences and 
the kind of people who would make good 
connections and reflect on their experi-
ences.

Before the fellowship, Mesman had 

only been outside of the United States 
once: to Spain in 2010 on an organized 
high school trip. He described this expe-
rience as “insulated” because he stayed 
with a group the entire time and didn’t 
interact with locals or plan his own trav-
els.

“Even though I’m traveling indepen-

dently I am never truly alone,” he said. 
“(There are) always new people to meet 
in hostels and around.”

Mesman said the hardest part of 

the experience, for him, has been the 
“impermanence” of relationships with 
the people he’s met while traveling.

“These relationships are temporary. 

At some point either they or I have to 
say goodbye and keep traveling,” he 
said. “Wash, Rinse, Repeat. I’m really a 
people person and I like having a sense 
of community — so I miss the way it felt 
to walk around campus and just run into 
people that you already know instead of 
just walking around as another face in 
the crowd.”

Mesman doesn’t currently have a plan 

to return home. After the eight months 
of the fellowship ends, he hopes to travel 
for as long as possible. He is also making 
plans to travel with his mother after the 
fellowship to wherever she chooses.

Like Mesman, Erin Busbee, who 

majored in anthropology, rarely traveled 
outside of the United States before the 
fellowship. A varsity track athlete at the 
University, she spent so much time prac-
ticing and competing that she wasn’t able 
to study abroad either.

Busbee has been in South America for 

almost five months, but she nearly didn’t 
apply for the fellowship in the first place. 
Two of her friends sent her information 
about the program months in advance, 
but she glossed it over while applying to 
policy fellowships in the United States.

She always dreamed of traveling but 

never thought something like the Bond-
erman fellowship would become a real-
ity.

“It kind of came naturally,” she said. 

“Traveling is something I’ve always 

wanted to do.”

Busbee said her experiences so far 

have been greatly enriched by the people 
she’s met in Santiago, Chile; Mendoza, 
Argentina; Cordoba, Argentina; Buenos 
Aires, Argentina; Montevideo, Uruguay; 
Salvador, Bahia in Brazil; and Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil.

“Most of my experience has been 

made by the people that I’ve met,” she 
said. “Going to so many places is nice. 
I’ve enjoyed experience different places, 
but after a certain point, being in Chile, 
Uruguay, Argentina, everything begins 
to look the same to me and the languages 
are similar. The people I’ve met and the 
things I’ve done have stood out.”

Once Busbee leaves South America, 

she will travel to South Africa and then 
the Phillipines and Thailand. She also 
hopes to add another country — if her 
visa allows her to, she would like to go to 
Mozambique after South Africa. If not, 
she might try to go to Japan.

Busbee said, the fellowship has 

opened her mind to a host of opportu-
nities she had never thought she would 
experience before. It has been a learning 
experience in every sense of the word.

“I’m thinking about things like living 

abroad for a few years whereas I always 
shied away from this sort of thing before,” 
Busbee said. “I’m definitely more open 
to not being in the United States and not 
quite having an exact career path. I can’t 
imagine being back and going to work 
every day.”

Louis Mirante also said the fellow-

ship, for him, has been about meeting 
and learning from the groups of people 
he has met. He had previously traveled 
in Europe and Mexico, but never to Asia 
or South America, and said that going to 
countries that aren’t dominated by the 
European way of thinking was one of the 
best experiences he had.

“You learn new ways of thinking,” he 

said. “Internalizing these new ways of 
thinking can help you learn about prob-
lems in new ways and think about solu-
tions to things you might not even have 
considered to be problems.”

At the time of his interview, Mirante 

was in the Maldives, a small island 
nation off the coast of Sri Lanka that 
wasn’t originally on his itinerary. He 
decided to travel here after finding cheap 

round trip tickets for a four-day trip — 
but stayed for a month.

Mirante was in the Maldives when he 

found himself in the middle of a water 
crisis. After a fire at the country’s main 
water plant, the entire northern part 
of the country had no running water. 
Mirante was in the Maldives the entire 
time, and he saw how they responded to 
the crisis, rationing out water from pub-
lic buildings and eventually, Sri Lanka 
and India.

“The way that they distributed it was 

from their main cultural centers, which 
are the mosques,” he said. “I stood in line 
for water at mosques with everyone else 
so I could have something to drink. That 
was definitely a really interesting expe-
rience.”

Mirante said he realized how much 

more he engages with a place when he 
does not set himself a date on when he is 
leaving.

“When you have an expiration date 

for an experience or a place, it really lim-
its how you think about traveling there,” 
Mirante said. “I really go with the flow. If 
I feel like its time for me to leave a place, 
I leave. If I feel like I should stay longer, 
I stay longer.”

Before the Fellowship began, Her-

miz’s only international travel was to 
France with her high school French 
class. She said the most surprising thing 
was how prevalent Western culture is 
internationally.

“In some places I was not expecting to 

see Starbucks or KFCs everywhere,” she 
said. “And it is not something that really 
surprised me, but it saddens me to see 
so many products that encourage skin 
whitening and to hear many young Cam-
bodian girls state that they do not like 
their skin because it is darker. I know 
how pervasive the white beauty stan-
dard is, but it is really crushing to see just 
how ingrained it is and how normative it 
is in both western and non-western cul-
tures.”

Though study abroad programs at 

the University can be expensive, the 
Bonderman Fellowship is free for all 
applicants. Mesman transferred to the 
University from a community college 
and only spent three years on campus. 
He always dreamed of traveling, but 
didn’t study abroad for financial reasons 

and to make the most of his time in Ann 
Arbor. When he discovered the Fellow-
ship, he said it was “too good to be true” 
and dropped all of his job applications at 
the time so he could focus on applying.

“I knew I would regret it for the rest of 

my life if I didn’t at least apply,” he said. 
“And now here I am.”

Mesman studied political science and 

philosophy at the University. He origi-
nally planned on going into domestic 
U.S. politics, but after traveling since 
August, his plans have changed.

“I’ve been looking into careers that 

are more internationally focused so I 
can combine my passion for travel with 
my work,” he wrote in an e-mail. “(I’m) 
not exactly sure what that looks like 
for me yet but I’ll begin exploring more 
options once I get back to the U.S.”

All four fellows agreed that the fel-

lowship has been a life changing experi-
ence, but in different ways. Hermiz said 
she has grown immensely because of her 
travels. She plans on going into Social 
Work, but said her experiences have 
helped her understand that internation-
al issues are just as important as social 
inequality in the U.S.

“I feel so much more independent now 

than I did before I left,” she said. “I take 
more risks and I am much more outgoing 
and patient. I am also constantly able to 
reflect on my experiences, but also ana-
lyze social issues in broader context.”

Mesman said the impacts of the Fel-

lowship on his life have forever changed 
him.

“I don’t think I’ll fully understand 

how it’s changed my life until it’s over 
and even some months beyond that,” 
Mesman said. “But right now I can say 
that I feel like the Fellowship has made 
me a more authentic me and tapped into 
my passion for exploration and learning. 
It’s simultaneously made me more confi-
dent and more humble about my under-
standing of the world and my place in 
it. It’s definitely shifted my perspective. 
There truly is nothing else like it.”

The 2015 application is open to any-

one who will have graduated between 
December 2014 and May 2015. The 
application requires a trip itinerary, 
three essays and two recommendations. 
Recipients will be notified by mid-Feb-
ruary.

Students abroad grapple with cultural consciousness

by Michael Sugerman, Daily News Editor

W

ith the plethora of opportuni-
ties for students to study abroad 
at the University of Michigan, 

it is nearly impossible to avoid destinations 
where the history is fraught with past vio-
lence or political tumult. In fact, it seems 
study in some of these places is encouraged 
so students can understand there is more to 
them than can be written in the pages of a 
history book.

Such is the opinion of Thuy’Anh Nguyen, 

a lecturer of Vietnamese language in the 
Department of Asian Languages and Cul-
ture. For years, Nguyen, who was born and 
raised in Vietnam, led a summer trip there 
through the University’s Global Intercultur-
al Experience for Undergraduates program. 
The last trip she led was in 2013.

“It’s the experience for the students, not 

just to be in Vietnam as a tourist, but to have 
an actual living experience, working experi-
ence in Vietnam,” Nguyen said.

The trip is about more than building 

knowledge, but also a “friendship” with both 
the people and the country, she added. The 
GIEU trips to Vietnam, she said, integrated 
Vietnamese students with University stu-
dents, and this exposure to even the most 
basic cultural differences was important.

“When they share experience with stu-

dents, it can be something like … TV shows 
that they watch,” Nguyen said, laughing that 
the students bonded over their love for the 
CBS sitcom “How I Met Your Mother.”

“Even experiences like (when) they share 

the rooms together. Vietnamese students 
may have different experiences using air 
conditioner. Because here it’s very cold and 
in Vietnam it’s very hot.”

Nguyen said a huge difference is the use 

of the bathroom. In Vietnam, something as 
simple as toilet paper is seen as “fancy” — 
sometimes, locals use crumpled-up news-
paper. She added that people flush very 
infrequently, which came as a surprise to 
American students who thought it was “less 
hygienic.”

However, Nguyen said, bridging cultural 

divides was often not the biggest hurdle; 
rather, it was exposing the American stu-
dents to the remnants of Vietnam War vio-
lence that was the hardest.

This manifested itself in a trip to the vil-

lage of My Lai, where in March 1968 Ameri-
can soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War 
killed the majority of Vietnamese locals — as 
many as 500 people — including children, 
women and the elderly.

“We went there, and we had first-hand 

experience seeing what happened and how 
Vietnamese people see it,” Nguyen said. 
“And then the U of M students would say, ‘Oh 
we feel very bad. We think that our Vietnam-
ese students would hate us because of what 
Americans have done.’ ”

However, Nguyen said, there was not 

hatred, but constructive discussion and sub-
sequent community service work to learn 
more about Vietnamese experiences and 
help ameliorate them. These efforts ranged 
from planting trees to building houses to 
simply exploring old war sites and gaining a 
better understanding of the history.

LSA junior Caroline Hickey was on the 

2013 trip to Vietnam and agreed that locals’ 
reception of Americans was far from hateful. 
Though she sometimes felt she “stuck out” 
because she is tall, blonde and white, she felt 
that the students were received with open 
arms.

“As far as the way people treated us, espe-

cially in small villages … people who were 
living there … who remembered the war very 
well were so kind to us, and invited us into 
their homes, and spoke with us and told us 
about their experiences,” she said.

The personal anecdotes were one piece 

in changing Hickey’s perspective. Another 
was the opportunity to walk through a field 
where there were still active landmines from 
the Vietnam War. She said the location was 
one where safe paths had been carved out by 
local researchers, but the prospect of having 
active landmines just inches away from her 
feet was enough to keep her on the sidelines 
instead of walking around.

“It’s very clear that we’re still part of their 

country and still harming people in such 
grave ways,” Hickey said.

For Hickey, this was the greatest takeaway 

— learning the nation’s history from the per-
spective of locals instead of U.S. history text-
books. Upon returning home, she said she 
felt that the U.S. education system “glosses 
over” the Vietnam War, and leaves little to 
no time for their side of the story.

The importance of learning new perspec-

tives, it seems, is what drives many of the 
University’s study abroad programs, espe-
cially in regions known for political unrest.

This lesson is true of Taglit-Birthright, 

which offers a free, 10-day trip to Israel for 
“young Jewish people” ages 18 to 26 in an 
effort to “strengthen Jewish identity, Jew-
ish communities and solidarity with Israel,” 
according to the program’s website. The Uni-
versity of Michigan Hillel organizes spon-
sored Birthright trips each year.

Gita Karasov, Hillel’s Director of Engage-

ment, staffed this winter’s trip, and said this 
summer’s heightened conflict between Israel 
and neighboring Arab populations in the 
Gaza Strip — which resulted in thousands of 
deaths in Palestine and hundreds of deaths 
in Israel — yielded not fear from students but 
an eagerness to gain a deeper understanding 
of the conflict.

“The group of students were well aware of 

the political climate in Israel this past sum-
mer,” she wrote in an e-mail interview, later 
adding that, “While on the trip, students had 
a heightened awareness to our surroundings 
and our proximity to places such as Gaza, the 
West Bank, and Syria, which led to thought-
ful discussions and questions throughout the 
trip.”

LSA sophomore Anna Marie Mondrusov 

went on this winter’s Birthright trip to Israel 
through Hillel, and said it was an opportu-
nity for her to learn more about Israel first-
hand, as opposed to what she had learned 
and followed growing up.

“You get to see the people, meet the peo-

ple, talk to them,” she said. “So you get to 
learn personal stories, not just what you 
heard on the news.”

Mondrusov said the summer’s violence 

is not a huge concern for those traveling in 
Israel — she never felt unsafe — but certain 
infrastructure in Israel serves as a constant 
reminder of potential attacks.

“The bus stops are all made of concrete; 

there are bomb shelters everywhere,” she 
said. “You can see that the city has had to 
change their lives to adapt to what’s happen-
ing to them.”

One striking reminder, she said, was that 

most if not all Israelis join the army after 
graduating from high school. She said their 
involvement in the Israeli Defense Force 
made these people more aware of their coun-
try’s politics and history than students in 
the United States, and at times more mature 
than their American counterparts.

“All of the Israelis my age there are work-

ing in the army. Some of them are working on 
the border, near Gaza,” she said. “So you get 
to hear actual stories of what happens on a 
day-to-day basis. We had the opportunity to 
stand on the hill bordering Gaza and Israel … 
where that summer, reporters were standing 
and they could see the rockets flying.”

She found, however, that the Birthright 

participants and younger army members had 
a great deal in common. One anecdote that 
sticks out to her was their shared love of tak-
ing selfies.

Ilan Ofir, a former Israel Fellow through 

Hillel who helped lead Birthright trips, just 
finished leading a two-week program in Isra-
el with MBA students from the University of 
California, San Diego. He said travel within 
the country, despite the summer’s conflict, is 
very safe.

“Most (of the students) have never heard 

of Israel before this (summer’s) events and 
yet chose to go to expose themselves to its 
strong startup culture,” Ofir said in an e-mail 
interview.

T

he word mostly sits there unpondered. But beneath 
it patiently tugs its historical baggage, all smudged 
with connotation and etymology and by roots of 

dead languages. The word is remarkable. The word is a 
minute palimpsest.

Whenever I ask my dad to proofread my essays, his 

Markup Word document comes back with a dense ladder 
of blue boxes, all variations of “John Gonzalez deleted the 
word autotelic” or “John Gonzalez replaced the word lacu-
na with gap.” I diligently heed the comma insertions and 
mend the split infinitives, but I keep the fancy words. My 
dad sighs in frustration. To him, good writing is practical; 
it communicates clearly and concisely.

But I love the words that puzzle and initially withhold, 

yet once Googled, snap the sentence into alignment the way 
the simple word couldn’t. Take the word susurrus, which 
I first came across in Charles Wright’s “The Southern 
Cross.” The word means “whispering, muttering, rustling.” 
All three synonyms in the definition have an onomatopoeic 
quality, but susurrus is particularly swaddled in its raspy 
ss sounds.

The word rustle evokes the clumsy jostling of leaves in a 

tree, but I imagine the susurration of leaves is finer, like a 
rain stick gently tipped.

The perfect word can be clear, but it must be lyrical. The 

perfect word shouldn’t worry about being recalcitrant to 
the languid reader’s gaze. Send her to the dictionary! The 
bon mot isn’t there to roll over and play dead. The word is 
alive, goddamn it! Tell me the word tipple doesn’t bubble 
effervescently on your tongue like a sip of champagne.

When I was reading “Lolita” a few years ago, I became 

overwhelmed by Nabokov’s luscious prose. I mean that 
hyperbolically, but also because I was reading an annotated 
edition, densely peppered with footnotes which even still 
couldn’t elucidate words like phocine (seal-like) and favo-
nian (of a western wind). I started a list on my iPhone and 

it grew into the sprawling 15-page Word document I keep 
continuously open on my computer.

I write down the words that bind an abstract concept 

into a small bundle of syllables — a word like slatch, which 
means an interval of fair weather. When I added that word, 
it was July in Ann Arbor and amidst the thick, nagging 
heat I couldn’t remember what a slatch was. Now that the 
days are sharp and short, I pray in vain for slatches, but the 
delight of the word itself is almost enough.

There are words that linger on the list that I’ve never 

used: I’m never going to write down “Assignation with C. 
– 9 p.m.” on my calendar, because assignation is one of the 
un-sexiest words for an illicit affair.

Then there are words that I wish I used more, like parox-

ysm, which just by saying elicits the spontaneous, splutter-
ing onset of emotion it describes. I love words so saturated 
with their meaning, they ooze on delivery.

It is funny that my dad is the most ardent crusader 

against my more self-indulgent vocabulary (restraint was 
used here to not substitute the word sybaritic), because he 
is the one who instilled my love of lexicon.

Almost every morning in fifth grade, we would hunch 

over the Word Jumble in the Union Tribune on the dining 
table. He knew the answers of course, but bit his tongue, 
letting me clench my teeth and scribble on the newspaper 
until it was time to go to school.

It was also around this time that he gave me his bat-

tered copy of “Animal Farm” and, shortly after, “1984.” I 
read them, absorbed probably nothing from them, but these 
inductive tomes were important. Over the years, I read and 
re-read them and by the time I was in junior high, I’d spent 
so much time in “1984” that Orwell’s lucid yet evocative 
prose felt mine as well.

Of course, Orwell detested the murky language of dou-

blespeak, but only because it obstructed his quest for preci-
sion of word and freshness of imagery. Too often, the fancy 

word slackens the taut cord of a sentence, rather than yank-
ing it tighter. Hence, my ever-growing word list remains 
perpetually perused, yet mostly unused.

But when the moment is right, I’m unafraid to use the 

fancy word. For every utilitarian Orwellian sentence, there 
is one by Nabokov, or, to return to my childhood, Snicket. 
Lemony Snicket, that is: the erudite, elusive author who 
penned my favorite series ever (sorry, Harry Potter), “A 
Series of Unfortunate Events,” the sardonic post-modern-
lit books tamped with literary references. Snicket taught 
me the words xenophobic (useful for a child of the Bush era) 
and ennui (perfect later for a teenager prone to overstate-
ment), but more so, he illustrated how the fancy word could 
pirouette spryly in the sentence between form and func-
tion.

The fancy word is adroit but aware of its witty immod-

eration, the guest at the cocktail party well-practiced with 
nimble ripostes. And more than that, when Snicket said “I 
know that having a good vocabulary doesn’t guarantee that 
I’m a good person, but it does mean I’ve read a great deal. 
And in my experience, well-read people are less likely to 
be evil,” I smiled at the snark, but swallowed the message.

The fancy word pays homage to a literary history; it skirts 

the stage of celebrity and zeitgeist — the fancy word will 
not be Oxford Dictionaries’ Word of the Year, it stubbornly 
protests the modern art of Internet speed-reading. The 
fancy word requests your attention and your intelligence, 
but it compensates generously for your time. It is the visible 
leaf in a long family tree of forgotten language and it asks 
you to sift through its branches. In a moment when beloved 
niche publications are being artlessly corporatized, raided 
for efficiency and use value before being jammed into a 
slick brand that slips off the mainstream tongue, the fancy 
word is a petite protest. It demands more from language 
and sentences and novels than easy consumption. It asks to 
be critically considered.

Childhood aspirations become reality

S

ince he was a child, Jim 
Harbaugh has imagined 
leading Michigan to a win 

over Ohio 
State.

“I’ve been 

thinking 
of (playing 
Ohio State) 
since I 
was eight 
years old,” 
Harbaugh 
told the 
Daily before 
the 1986 season. “Playing against 
the Buckeyes in Ohio State’s 
stadium for the Big Ten title 
— that would be a dream come 
true.”

During the week before The 

Game that year, Harbaugh 
guaranteed Michigan 
would beat the Buckeyes in 
Columbus. So confident was 
the quarterback that he and 
co-captain Andy Moeller had 
purchased a plaque for coach Bo 
Schembechler commemorating 
his 166th victory in Ann Arbor 
— a result that would put him 
ahead of Fielding H. Yost as the 
Wolverines’ all-time leader.

And Harbaugh backed up 

his guarantee, playing game 
manager for Jamie Morris as 
the running back slashed Ohio 
State for 210 yards to key a 26-24 
victory.

“I didn’t say it to be cocky or 

arrogant or anything,” Harbaugh 
said of his promise after the win. 
“I just said what I felt.”

Then he and Moeller 

presented Schembechler with 
his plaque.

* * *

N

ow that he’s Michigan’s 
coach, Harbaugh isn’t 
making any more bold 

predictions.

“I made a guarantee a long 

time ago, and I’ve learned from 
that,” he said last Tuesday.

But it isn’t hard to imagine 

greatness with Harbaugh at the 
helm. After all, he has succeeded 
everywhere he has been, 
including at Michigan as a player 
from 1983-86, 
at San Diego 
and Stanford 
as a college 
coach from 
2004-10, and 
with San 
Francisco fom 
2011-14.

And there 

is returning 
talent across 
the board. The offensive line, 
which was passable despite its 
inexperience in 2014, returns in 
its entirety. The running back 
trio of Derrick Green, De’Veon 

Smith and Drake Johnson will 
be joined by a former five-
star recruit, Ty Isaac, who 
transferred from Southern 
California and sat out last 

season. The 
secondary 
corps is solid, 
as are the 
linebackers 
and the 
receivers — 
though the 
Wolverines 
will need to 
replace Devin 
Funchess.

Get a decent defensive line 

and forge a reliable quarterback 
out of either sophomore Shane 
Morris, freshman Wilton 
Speight or early enrollee Alex 

Malzone, and suddenly you have 
pieces for what could be an elite 
team.

And have you seen Harbaugh’s 

track record 
of improving 
quarterbacks? 
Can you 
imagine 
how good 
Michigan’s 
defense could 
be with D.J. 
Durkin at 
coordinator 
and Greg 
Mattison coaching the 
linebackers?

“There are no turnarounds 

at Michigan,” Harbaugh said 
during his introductory press 
conference last Tuesday. “This 

is greatness and a long tradition 
of it.”

Maybe Harbaugh hasn’t been 

following the Wolverines since 

2008. Then 
again, maybe 
Harbaugh’s 
Michigan will 
look more like 
the Michigan 
of 1986 than 
anything we’ve 
seen lately.

H

arbaugh can’t win the 
big game. That’s what 
his critics say.

His 49ers reached the 

NFC Championship in three 
consecutive seasons but never 

won the Super Bowl. He didn’t 
go out a winner at Michigan, 
either — he lost the Rose Bowl 
his senior year.

But he’s the right man for 

the job. And — with apologies 
to Jim Hackett — it’s not just 
because he’s a “Michigan Man,” 
either. He turns mediocre 
quarterbacks into great ones 
and turns losing teams in 
championship ones.

“There is no quarterback in 

the country that I’d rather go 
into the season with than Jim 
Harbaugh,” Schembechler said 
in 1986.

There’s no coach Michigan 

would rather go into the 2015 
season with, either.

One recruit expects 

Harbaugh to land several big-
name recruits before signing 
day. Many current players 
expressed their disbelief and 
excitement that Michigan had 
hired such a big name. A former 
player said he wished he could 
re-enroll and run onto the Big 
House turf again.

What would Schembechler 

say of Michigan and Harbaugh 
now?

“ ‘You got the right guy,’ ” 

Lloyd Carr imagined. “ ‘Hackett, 
you did a great job. Harbaugh, 
get to work.’ I think that’s what 
he’d say. He’d be awfully happy.”

As for Harbaugh? Well, he 

isn’t making any promises. 
But it’s time to get to work — 
starting with a team meeting 
Wednesday night. After all, 
Michigan hosts Ohio State in 
just 325 days.

Harbaugh has been preparing 

for that moment since he was a 
child.

Michigan appoints 
Harbaugh as coach

By MAX BULTMAN AND 

GREG GARNO 

Daily Sports Editor and Daily 

Sports Writer

Jim Harbaugh’s first press 

conference as Michigan football 
coach was filled with laughter 
and clapping from the players, 
coaches and family looking on.

But the room of hundreds went 

quiet when Harbaugh was asked 
if he was inheriting a turnaround 
program.

“This is Michigan,” Harbaugh 

said. “There are no turnarounds 
at Michigan. This is greatness.”

He added in his statement: 

“Throughout my life I have 
dreamed of coaching at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Now I have 
the honor to live it.”

The Michigan Athletic Depart-

ment announced the hiring of 
the former San 
Francisco 49ers 
coach on Tues-
day afternoon, 
the 20th coach 
in 
program 

history. 
Har-

baugh 
agreed 

to a seven-year 
contract paying 
a base salary of 
$5 million per 
year.

Hoarse-voiced from a gatorade 

bath in his NFL-finale Sunday, he 
handled his first press conference 
nearly an hour after address-
ing his team for the first time. 
Harbaugh didn’t give a timeline 
for when he planned to name a 
coaching staff.

A former quarterback under 

Bo Schembechler, Harbaugh was 
an All-American and Heisman 
Trophy finalist, but he’s been part 
of the Wolverines’ program since 
he was nine years old. Harbaugh’s 
father, Jack, was the defensive 
backs coach at Michigan while 
Jim was growing up.

It was then, Harbaugh said, 

that he first dreamed of coaching 
at Michigan.

“When I was nine to 10 years 

old, there was a time when I was 

sitting in coach Schembechler’s 
office. I was sitting in his chair; 
I had my feet up on his desk,” 
Harbaugh recalled. “He walked 
in and said, ‘How ya doin’, Jim?’ 
And I said, ‘I’m doing great Bo, 
how you doin’? He said, ‘Whatta-
ya doin?’ and I said, ‘I’m sitting in 
your chair, coach!’ ... There’s just 
been times in my life where I’ve 
thought about it, dreamed about 
it, and now it’s time to live it.”

In addition to his $5 million 

base salary, Harbaugh’s contract 
includes incentives for playing in 
($125,000) or winning ($250,000) 
the Big Ten Championship Game, 
a $50,000 bonus if he is Big Ten 
Coach of the Year and a $150,000 
bonus for each year the team’s 
Academic Progress Rate is 960 
or higher. He can also earn 
$300,000 for playing the Col-
lege Football Playoff or $500,000 

for 
winning 

the 
national 

championship.

His 
con-

tract includes 
a $2 million 
signing bonus.

Michigan 

marks 
Har-

baugh’s fourth 
head coaching 
job in the last 

10 years, most recently in San 
Francisco, where his base salary 
is roughly the same as it will be 
with the Wolverines.

“I kind of think of myself as 

a construction guy,” Harbaugh 
said. “You build this home, and 
hopefully it’s a great cathedral, 
and then afterwards they tell you, 
‘Go build another one.’ And I feel 
like that again. … But I’d really 
like to live in one permanently. 
And that’s what I’m really hope-
ful for here.”

Harbaugh insisted his decision 

to take the Michigan job had little 
to do with his salary or financial 
considerations.

“I really made a decision from 

the heart, which I thought was 
best for myself and my family,” 
Harbaugh said. “I’m very excited 
by it and very challenged by it.”

“There are no 
turnarounds at 
Michigan. This 
is greatness.”

Sharp shooting powers 
Wolverines over PSU

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

STATE COLLEGE — From the 

moment Zak Irvin’s midrange 
jumper on the game’s first 
possession went through the net, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team finally shot the ball the way 
it’s supposed to.

Coming 

off a game 
against 
Purdue in 
which they shot 18.2 percent in 
the second half, the Wolverines 
rode a much-improved shooting 
effort to dispatch the Nittany 
Lions, 73-64.

Junior guard Caris LeVert 

finished with 18 points and 
Irvin added 17, both bouncing 
back from an ugly game against 
the Boilermakers that saw the 
pair shoot a combined 4-for-
20 from the floor. Tuesday, the 
two combined to shoot over 70 
percent.

“I think we slowed the game 

down,” LeVert said. “We took 
(much) easier 3s, and when the 
shot clock came (down) I think 
we got good shots.”

Despite Michigan shooting 

53.3 percent from the floor, the 
Nittany Lions hung around the 
whole way. Even when freshman 
forward Aubrey Dawkins used 
back-to-back 
3-pointers 
to 

stretch the Wolverines’ lead to 
double digits with 11:40 to play, 
the Nittany Lions had an answer.

D.J. Newbill, the Big Ten’s 

leading scorer, and John Johnson 
kept Penn State alive until the 
game’s final minute, making 12 
of the Nittany Lions’ 22 field 
goals and finishing with 20 and 
16 points, respectively. After 
Dawkins appeared to create some 
separation in the game, Newbill 
led a 12-2 run that knotted the 
game at 53 with 7:40 remaining.

But down the stretch, LeVert 

looked 
cool 
and 
composed, 

creating space for himself on one 
jumper in the lane and beating 
the shot clock on another from 
the wing to keep Michigan 
steady.

“They went to that matchup, 

that little 2-3 zone, and we kind 
of were stagnant a little bit,” 
LeVert said. “I just tried to take 
it upon myself to get some easy 
baskets.”

Finally, Irvin got loose on a 

fast break and threw down an 
easy dunk to put the Wolverines 
up by eight with under a minute 
to play. And while Johnson 
knocked down a corner 3 to 
keep it close, Penn State couldn’t 
make another rally.

Michigan (2-1 Big Ten, 9-6 

overall) might have been able to 
run away with the game in the 
first half had it not committed 
nine turnovers. The Wolverines 
shot 12-for-23 from the floor 
and 85.7 percent from beyond 
the arc in the first frame, a huge 
turnaround from their abysmal 
performance against Purdue. 
Irvin and LeVert combined for 19 
of Michigan’s 36 first-half points 
and went 3-for-3 on 3-pointers.

Normally, that kind of showing 

would have given the Wolverines 
a large lead against a poor-
shooting Nittany Lions squad.

But Penn State (0-3, 12-4) 

wouldn’t go away, thanks in 
part to several sloppy first-half 
mistakes by Michigan. Junior 
guard Spike Albrecht — who 
started 
alongside 
sophomore 

guard Derrick Walton Jr. in the 
backcourt — even took points 
off the board when he made a 
3-pointer but had it washed out 
due to an up-and-down call. 
Albrecht 
was 
also 
whistled 

for an early out-of-bounds call 
along 
the 
baseline, 
looking 

uncharacteristically unaware of 
his position on the court.

“We would drive into that 

jungle (down low), and they 
weren’t giving a lot of help,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“You get in there and there’s all 
these tall trees, and all of the 
sudden we were just throwing 
the ball all over the place.”

While Albrecht didn’t score 

a point, he recovered from his 
early turnovers to record six 
assists and served to take the 
pressure off Walton, who has 
been battling a toe injury since 
the Progressive Legends Classic 
in November.

Michigan desperately needed 

a win in Happy Valley to avoid 
getting left behind in Big Ten 
play before taking on the elite 
teams in the conference. And if 
the Wolverines can build off their 
improved 
showing 
Tuesday, 

which saw their freshmen rack 
up 24 points, they may be able to 
generate some momentum.

“The basket is getting a little 

bigger right now for some of our 
guys,” Beilein said. “It’s not going 
in the way it will, hopefully, in 
the future, but it seems they’re 
a little bit smoother in their 
stroke. They’re just feeling a 
little bit better.”

Irvin, LeVert lead resurgence

Shooters break out 

of slumps to key 
offense in win

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

STATE COLLEGE — For a few 

minutes just three days ago, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
looked like it may never score 
again.

A dismal showing against 

Purdue last Saturday was the 
low point for an up-and-down 
Wolverine offense, which has 
been prone to tremendous cold 
stretches.

Deepening the severity of 

the team’s recent struggles, 
junior guard Caris LeVert and 
sophomore forward Zak Irvin 
— Michigan’s two main options 
for carrying the offensive load 
— had both struggled with 
bouts of inconsistency since 
the Wolverines’ victory over 
Syracuse on Dec. 3.

But in Tuesday’s game against 

Penn State, Michigan’s shooters 
— who shot 53.3 percent from 
the floor, including 9-for-15 on 
3-pointers — orchestrated a far 

more efficient offensive attack. 
Rather than forcing their shots, 
the Wolverines instead focused 
on picking their spots to create 
better scoring opportunities.

“(If you average) eight shots 

a game, maybe if you shot six a 
game, you still might make three 
out of six and you won’t give up 
two possessions,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “We all were 
a lot more selective today.”

The resurgent offense — led by 

LeVert and Irvin, who finished 
the game with 18 and 17 points, 
respectively — was the deciding 
factor 
in 
Michigan’s 
73-64 

victory over the Nittany Lions.

In the first half, Irvin looked 

like a different player than the 
one who went 2-for-12 from the 
floor in West Lafayette. After 
exhibiting poor shot selection 
and execution against Purdue — 
including several missed layups 
— Irvin was back on his game 
early against Penn State. He 
drilled a long, contested jumper 
for the first points of the game 
and also knocked down his first 
two 3-point attempts.

More 
importantly, 
Irvin 

exhibited both patience and 
confidence with the ball in his 
hands. Instead of taking shots 

early in the shot clock and 
looking unsure of himself — as 
he did for long stretches against 
the Boilermakers — he seemed 
content to pass the ball around 
and wait for a better chance.

“I just let the game come to 

me,” Irvin said. “You don’t want 
to force anything. (I tried) to 
just take open, good shots that I 
can make. I think that was a big 
reason why we won today.”

Added Beilein: “(Irvin) has 

the ability to get (his) own shot, 
but that doesn’t mean it’s a 
good shot all the time. Just (by) 
waiting, getting a little bit more 
space, a little bit more rhythm, 
your shooting percentage will 
go up.”

And even when Irvin missed a 

shot, he refused to give up on the 
play. After clanking a wide-open 
triple off the left side of the rim 
midway through the second half, 
he hustled to the glass to grab his 
own rebound. Seconds later, he 
kicked the ball out to freshman 
guard Aubrey Dawkins for an 
easy corner 3.

In 
a 
game 
where 
the 

Wolverines 
committed 
15 

turnovers 
and 
allowed 
36 

combined points from guard 
D.J. Newbill and backup John 
Johnson, 
it 
was 
Michigan’s 

shooting that averted a second-
half collapse. But with 7:40 
remaining, Penn State used a 
12-2 run to tie the game at 53.

Then it was LeVert’s turn to 

pull his weight.

Despite 
receiving 
heavy 

attention 
from 
the 
Nittany 

Lions’ defenders, LeVert had no 
trouble finding scoring chances 
in key situations. In two separate 
instances when Michigan was 
clinging to a one-possession 
lead, LeVert nailed both a step-
back jumper and a difficult 
banked shot off the glass. Having 
no trouble finding shots, LeVert 
stifled Penn State’s comeback 
attempt.

Ultimately, the Wolverines’ 

shot selection proved to be the 
difference in an otherwise ugly 
victory.

Michigan holds off late push

Wolverines race out 
of gates, withstand 

late run

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Writer

With 3:52 left in the game, 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico called a timeout.

After 

jumping 
out of the 
locker 
room, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team had started 
off the second half with eight 
unanswered points in the first 
two minutes, leading to the 
Wolverines’ biggest lead of 
Sunday afternoon, 49-31.

But No. 24 Michigan State 

was able to steadily hack away 
at the difference, cutting the 
lead to just seven points. Barnes 
Arico needed to steady her team.

Her 
methods 
worked. 

Michigan was able to hold off 
the Spartans in a 74-65 victory.

“I 
think 
we 
started 
to 

struggle and started to lose 
our confidence a little bit — 
especially our young kids,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We called 
a couple timeouts, just saying 
‘Keep trying to stay aggressive, 
keep trying to get to the free 
throw line.’ … It was great for 
us to have to be in that situation 
and pull one out.”

No one expected Michigan 

State to start off the Big Ten 
season 0-3. Nor was it expected 
that 
the 
Wolverines 
would 

shock 
the 
Spartans, 
who 

previously led the series by 
63-16 and had won nine of the 
past 10 meetings.

Because 
Michigan 
State 

(0-3 Big Ten, 8-6 overall) was 
without two 6-foot-7 forwards 
with injuries, the Spartans had 
a tough time guarding senior 
forward Cyesha Goree.

Goree shot 4-for-6 in the 

first half and scored 14 points 
overall. Michigan State charged 
Becca Mills with the task of 
defending Goree by herself, a 
role that is usually covered by at 
least two players.

Though the Spartans were 

limited, Michigan State leaned 
on forward Aerial Powers. The 
redshirt sophomore recorded 
her 11th double-double of the 
season and scored 26 points 
against 
Michigan.

Sophomore 

guard 
Siera 

Thompson 
set the tone 
early 
when 

she 
scored 

the 
first 

points of the 
game in the 
form of a long 
3-pointer. 
Freshman 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty would follow suit, 
shooting 4-for-4 from beyond 
the arc for 12 first-half points.

Flaherty later came off the 

bench again, replacing junior 
guard 
Madison 
Ristovski 

five minutes into the game. 
Flaherty’s presence helped lead 
a 20-5 run midway through the 
first stanza.

With five minutes to go until 

halftime, the sizable Spartan 
road crowd was given hope 

when guard Lexi Gussert flung 
up a trey from the corner to 
lessen the gap to nine points. 
The 
Wolverines 
(2-1, 
10-4) 

headed to the locker room with 
a 10-point lead.

Michigan 

State couldn’t 
catch a break, 
failing 
to 

score in the 
first 
four 

minutes of the 
second 
half. 

The struggles 
continued as 
the Spartans 
were limited 
to five points 

in the first 10 minutes of the half.

But then the momentum 

shifted. Michigan State went 
on an 11-0 run and guard Tori 
Jankoska hit a long 3-pointer 
to lessen the Michigan’s lead 
to eight points. Crisler Center 
erupted into chants of “Go 
Green, Go White.”

The Wolverines and Spartans 

went on to match each other 
shot for shot, but nerves started 
to wreak havoc on Flaherty. In 
an uncharacteristic showing, 

Flaherty missed two wide-open 
threes and turned the ball over 
to Michigan State to give the 
Spartans their best chance at 
overcoming the deficit.

But 
she 
regained 
her 

confidence and shot a perfect 
3-pointer, followed by two made 
free throws and a step-back 
jumper.

“My team really helps me, 

even when I’m missing my 
shots,” Flaherty said. “They just 
tell me to stay confident, same 
with my coaches. I went on a 
streak when I couldn’t really hit 
anything and they both told me 
‘Keep shooting, keep shooting,’ 
so I kept doing that and when 
things fell, I think that really 
pulled us away.”

Added 
Barnes 
Arico: 

“(Flaherty) 
made 
some 
big 

buckets for us down the stretch 
and she made some key free 
throws for us down the stretch. 
Anytime a freshman is in that 
kind of pressure situation is 
really impressive, and I think 
she handled it extremely well.”

Her late poise might have 

saved Michigan from Michigan 
State.

Focus keys victory 
over Michigan State 

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

In three of the Michigan 

women’s basketball team’s four 
losses this season, one of the 
main problems plaguing the 
team was a lack of focus on 
both ends of the court. Confu-
sion on defense, an ineffective 
transition game and inconsis-
tent late-game shooting were 
the Wolverines’ undoing in one-
sided losses against Pittsburgh, 
Princeton, and Wisconsin.

Facing a crucial rivalry game 

against No. 24 Michigan State 
on Sunday at Crisler Center, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico knew her team simply 
had no room for those kinds of 
errors.

The Wolverines clearly knew 

it, too.

From the opening tip, Michi-

gan’s defense brought the inten-
sity Barnes Arico has been 
looking for all season, grabbing 
15 steals and forcing 24 Spar-
tan turnovers. In a memorable 
stretch to start the game, the 
Wolverines forced 11 turnovers 
before their offense gave away 
the ball even once.

“We really came out and 

surprised them right away,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We were 
super aggressive and were on 
the attack. Our kids were really 
focused, playing hard, diving on 
the floor, doing what we had to 
do to be successful.”

Just as important to the vic-

tory was the consistent ability of 
Michigan’s offense to capitalize 
on the defensive plays. Instead 
of throwing errant passes or 
taking quick, ill-advised shots 
in transition, the Wolverines 
made sure the Spartans paid for 
their mistakes.

In a dominant first half, 

Michigan parlayed Michigan 
State’s errors into a 20-5 scor-
ing run, including 12 straight 
points.

Freshman guard Katelynn 

Flaherty, who has occasionally 
struggled with her shot against 

stingy defenses, buried her first 
four 3-point attempts against 
the Spartans.

All in all, the Wolverines 

scored 27 points off of turn-
overs, most of which came in 
the first half.

“Our best offense was off of 

our defensive pressure,” Barnes 
Arico said. “When we had to set 
up in half-court in the second 
half, we kind of got a little stag-
nant and weren’t as aggressive 
attacking.”

The importance of focus 

for the Wolverines became 
even clearer when they almost 
allowed their lead to slip away 
late in the second half. Despite 
holding Michigan State to two 
separate five-minute scoring 
droughts in the second frame, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
let 
up 

temporarily with 10 minutes 
remaining, allowing an 11-0 
run.

The offense fell a bit out of 

sync in the later stages as well, 
finishing the game with 14 turn-
overs after playing a relatively 
clean first half.

“We had a couple lapses,” 

Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“When 

you’re playing an opponent 
that’s beaten you 23 out of the 
last 25 times, you can’t take a 
possession off. You can’t relax.”

But in the end, the Wolver-

ines regained their focus to 
pull away with a 74-65 win. By 
getting back to knocking down 
shots and executing the intan-
gibles — which Barnes Arico 
always stresses — Michigan 
was able to pick up its second 
straight victory over a defend-
ing Big Ten co-champion.

“We really talked about stay-

ing focused, playing hard, doing 
the intangible things, and I 
thought we did (today),” Barnes 
Arico said. “We forced turn-
overs, we got a 10-second vio-
lation, we got a 30-second shot 
clock violation, we were diving 
on the floor, we were taking 
charges … we played incredibly 
well and made (the win) happen 
for us.”

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Kim Barnes Arico’s team held on after a strong start against No. 24 Michigan State for a rare upset of the Spartans.

“It was great for 
us to have to be in 
that situation and 

pull one out.”

GLI, World Juniors highlight 
successful break for Wolverines

‘M’ wins GLI 

down four players 
competing with 

Team USA

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

No starts, no problem for Steve 

Racine.

Though it had been nearly two 

months since his last start, the 
junior goaltender looked right 
at home between the pipes at 
the Great Lakes Invitational in 
Detroit. Racine stopped 71 of 73 
shots and led the Michigan hockey 
team to consecutive 2-1 victories 
en route to the Wolverines’ 16th 
GLI title on Dec. 29.

“I had my fingers crossed,” said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson 
about the decision to start Racine. 
“When you’re coaching a team 
and you get players on the team 
that aren’t playing well, they’re on 
the team for a reason. You know 
you’ve seen them play well. That’s 
why you recruited them. It’s just a 
matter of, ‘Can you do it now?’

“I 
thought 
Steve 
Racine 

stepped up and did it now.”

In addition to Racine, Michigan 

(2-1 
Big 
Ten, 
10-7 
overall) 

exceeded expectations at the GLI. 
Despite losing four key players to 
a brief stint with the United States 
World 
Junior 
Championship 

team, the Wolverines were able to 
avenge previous losses to then-No. 
5 Michigan Tech before beating 
Michigan State the following 
night.

Senior forward Zach Hyman 

led the way with two game-
winning goals, but Berenson was 
pleased with the entire team’s 
effort.

“If you were to ask me a couple 

weeks ago about our chances in 
the GLI, I would have said that 
our team is really going to have to 

overachieve,” Berenson said. “We 
had players that hadn’t played 
that well. Our team hasn’t played 
that well. Our goals-against has 
not been what it should be. Now 
we’ve got some players missing, 
so we really had to step up.

“Players that hadn’t been in 

the lineup on a regular basis were 
going to have to step in and do a 
job, and they 
did that.”

The 

tournament 
win 
was 
the 

first of any kind 
for 
Michigan 

since 2011, and 
it comes at a 
crucial 
time. 

Stumbling 
to 

a 2-5 start to 
the season — 
the team’s worst since 1986 — 
the Wolverines have won eight 
of their last 10 games to put 
themselves back into the mix for 
the NCAA Tournament.

“This is exactly what we 

needed coming into the second 
half of the year,” Racine said. “We 

know it’s only two games, but it’s 
something to build off of, and 
we’re excited for what the rest of 
the year has to hold.”

The 
wins 
seem 
more 

impressive when factoring in the 
Wolverines that didn’t contribute 
to the tournament title. Four 
of Michigan’s top eight scorers 
participated in the WJC, where 

the Americans 
went 
3-2 

before falling 
to Russia in the 
quarterfinals.

Freshman 

forward Dylan 
Larkin led the 
U.S. team with 
five goals and 
two 
assists, 

and 
was 

named one of 

the team’s top three players by 
his coaches. Sophomore forwards 
Tyler Motte and JT Compher 
and freshman defenseman Zach 
Werenski also contributed to the 
team’s tournament run.

Though they weren’t able to 

aid Michigan over the break, the 

four look to utilize the added 
game experience in the second 
half of the season.

“It’s 
really 
nice 
because 

we just played in a bunch of 
pressure-packed 
games, 
very 

high intensity,” Compher told 
MGoBlue.com. “To come back 
and know that there’s something 
to look forward to right away 
with a really big series helps get 
my mind off of what wasn’t a 
great tournament really.”

While Compher and company 

competed at an international 
level, the Wolverines still in Ann 
Arbor were able to rest for the 
first time since the season began. 
Based on the results in Detroit, it 
was much-needed.

“The break was a good chance 

for us to regroup,” Racine said. 
“The first half of the season didn’t 
go exactly how we wanted it to 
go. So we went home, had some 
nice time with our families. We 
knew coming back that we had 
to step it up, and that guys that 
hadn’t had opportunities before 
would be called on and had to 
make the most of it.”

‘M’ wins 3rd straight 
Orange Bowl Classic

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

For the Daily

When it comes time for the 

Michigan women’s swimming 
and diving team to compete, 
coach Mike Bottom leaves his 
athletes with one expression to 
draw inspiration from.

“Why not me?”
This past weekend in Key 

Largo, Florida, the Wolverines 
responded with a first-place 
finish in the Orange Bowl Swim 
Classic, 
marking 
the 
third 

straight victory at this short-
course meter event.

The team placed either first 

or second in eight of the 10 
individual events. In three of 
those events — the 100-meter 
free, 
100-meter 
backstroke 

and 50-meter backstroke — 
the Wolverines placed in the 
top three spots. Michigan’s 
swimmers set four Orange Bowl 
Swim Classic records.

One of Michigan’s record-

setters 
included 
junior 
Ali 

DeLoof, who, despite primarily 
swimming 
backstroke 
and 

freestyle, placed first in the 
50-meter 
butterfly 
(28.02). 

Three of her teammates also 
earned first with record times: 
freshman Gillian Ryan in the 
400-meter freestyle (4:16.17), 
freshman Clara Smiddy in the 
100-meter backstroke (1:01.44) 
and 
sophomore 
Madeline 

Frost in the 50-meter freestyle 
(26.36).

Along with the four record-

setting times, DeLoof also took 
first in the 50-meter backstroke 
(28.90) and Kopas won the 
50-meter breaststroke (32.91) 
and the 100-meter breaststroke 
(1:11.15). 
Junior 
Marni 

Oldershaw also added a pair of 
first-place finishes in the 100-
meter butterfly (1:04.11) and the 
200-meter individual medley 
(2:19.14).

“Realizing that I can swim 

the 50-fly event made me more 
comfortable training,” DeLoof 
said. “It was nice to swim 
something different.”

Michigan’s 
dominance 

extended to the relay races, 
where the Wolverines finished 
in first place. The 200-meter 
medley relay was raced by 
DeLoof, Kopas, Smiddy and 
junior Zoe Mattingly. Frost later 
replaced Kopas in Michigan’s 
winning 200-meter freestyle 
relay.

The success caps off the 

team’s winter training sessions, 
which culminated in a dominant 
showing at the Orange Bowl 
Swim Classic, as was expected.

“This was not a big meet,” 

Bottom said, “so those people 
who 
have 
not 
scored 
for 

Michigan can see that scoring is 
a possibility.”

More importantly, this meet 

inspired the athletes to push 
themselves harder with the 
‘Why not me?’ campaign at the 
forefront.

Added 
Oldershaw: 
“My 

parents have always said ‘Why 
not me?’ to me, so it was touching 
to hear my coach say it too.”

Michigan is showing that 

success and progress comes 
from a positive mindset, and 
Bottom has made it increasingly 
important 
that 
any 
athlete 

can envision herself atop the 
podium.

With attention turning to the 

upcoming dual meet against 
Notre Dame and Northwestern, 
the battle between the schools 
will come down to total team 
points rather than single events.

The Orange Bowl Classic was 

more of an individual swimmer’s 
race 
rather 
than 
a 
team 

mentality, and that mindset 
will shift to the opposite this 
weekend.

“We’ve been underdogs, we’re 

rising and it’s becoming ‘Why 
not us?’ ” Oldershaw said.

‘M’ takes 5th in Tennessee

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

In 
early 
January, 
in 

Chattanooga, 
Tennessee, 
the 

Michigan wrestling team had 
a championship atmosphere to 
compete in.

That 
served 
as 
good 

preparation, 
because 
the 

15th-ranked 
Wolverines 
will 

have plenty more in the coming 
months during Big Ten season.

Five was the magic number 

for Michigan, as it finished fifth, 
with 
five 
wrestlers 
earning 

points, at the Southern Scuffle on 
Thursday and Friday.

“This tournament was a really 

positive experience for us,” said 
Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“It had an NCAA championship-
caliber feel to it.”

The tournament got off to a 

fast start for the Wolverines, 
as they went 5-0 in the first 
round on Thursday. Redshirt 
sophomore 
Conor 
Youtsey, 

redshirt freshman George Fisher, 
sophomores Brian Murphy and 
Domenic Abounader and fifth-
year senior Max Huntley each 
posted victories.

Fisher 
rode 
the 
early 

momentum 
with 
a 
strong 

showing 
in 
the 
141-pound 

class. 
He 
defeated 
Drexel’s 

Franco Ferraina, 19-4, with six 
takedowns and five back points. 

Despite falling to Oklahoma 
State’s Dean Heil, 7-2, he later 
rebounded to top Heil in a 9-3 
decision to place seventh.

Not to be outdone, sophomore 

heavyweight Adam Coon fought 
his way to a runner-up finish. 
His signature win came when 
he pinned Kent State’s Samuel 
Breese 4:27 into the match, while 
his only blemish was a loss to No. 
4 Austin Marsden of Oklahoma 
State in the finals, 7-3.

“(Coon) 
was 
disappointed 

with his last match,” McFarland 
said. “He couldn’t score when he 
needed to.”

Junior 
Rossi 
Bruno 
also 

placed second for Michigan at 
133 pounds. He topped North 
Carolina’s Troy Heilmann in 
an 11-1 major decision and No. 6 
Mason Beckman of Lehigh in a 
7-5 tiebreaker. But Iowa State’s 
No. 13 Earl Hall kept Bruno from 
the top spot, 5-2.

Abounader built off his first-

round success to leave the 
tournament with a 6-2 record 
and a fifth-place finish in the 
184-pound class, topping No. 9 
Willie Miklus of Missouri, 4-3, 
Nebraska’s T.J. Dudley, 4-3, and 
Oklahoma State’s Nolan Boyd, 
5-3, in the process.

Huntley followed his first 

triumph at 197 pounds with two 
more victories, including one over 
the Golden Flashes’ Cole Baxter, 

13-2. He lost to Penn State’s 
Morgan McIntosh, 7-4, in the 
quarterfinals before rebounding 
for two wins and then defaulting 
out due to injury and ending the 
tournament in sixth. McFarland 
said he didn’t expect the injury to 
be a long-term problem.

Although they both missed 

placing by a single match, Youtsey 
and Murphy left Chattanooga 
with 4-2 records in the 125-
pound and 157-pound classes, 
respectively.

“There 
were 
some 
tough 

losses late in the tournament,” 
McFarland said. “But we had a lot 
of great individual performances, 
and that’s something we can 
build off of.”

The Southern Scuffle was 

the 
Wolverines’ 
last 
contest 

before conference play begins. 
Including Michigan, 10 Big Ten 
teams are currently ranked in 
the top 25 nationally, with Iowa 
and Minnesota at No. 1 and No. 2, 
respectively. Michigan will have 
to wrestle against seven of those 
teams, but McFarland believes 
his team will be healthy and 
ready for the daunting task ahead 
of them.

“We were a little undermanned 

entering the tournament, and 
that was frustrating,” McFarland 
said. “But right now we’re 
focusing on conference play, and 
we should be ready to go.”

Barnes Arico rekindles old 
rivalry with newcomer Rutgers

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Writer

This weekend, the Michigan 

women’s basketball team bathed 
in the glory of 
defeating 
its 

in-state 
rival, 

then-No. 
24 

Michigan State.

The 

Wolverines’ 
victory 
was 

hard-earned, 
given that they 
have 
dropped 

their last three 
meetings with 
the 
Spartans. 

The 
win 

embodied 
the 

idea 
of 
the 

“Michigan way” that coach Kim 
Barnes Arico has alluded to in the 
past — a style defined by physical 
and mental grit.

That same toughness must 

continue for Michigan (2-1 Big 
Ten, 10-4 overall) to defeat No. 
24 Rutgers when the Wolverines 
travel 
to 
New 
Jersey 
on 

Wednesday.

“I tried to get away from 

(Rutgers) when I left the East 
Coast, 
and 

here 
they 

are again in 
our 
league,” 

Barnes Arico 
told 
WTKA 

Radio 
on 

Tuesday. 
“Anytime 
you 
go 
to 

the 
(Rutgers 

Athletic 
Center), 
it’s 

going to be incredibly difficult.”

Before 
moving 
from 
the 

American Athletic Conference 
to the Big Ten, Rutgers ended 
last season with a 2014 WNIT 
Championship. Luckily for the 
Scarlet Knights, they still have 
their ace — their coach.

Vivian Stringer — the third-

winningest coach in women’s 
basketball history — will return 
to the Big Ten for the first time 

since 1995, when she coached her 
12th and final season with Iowa.

During her time with the 

Hawkeyes, Stringer went 269-
84, 
including 
a 
Final 
Four 

appearance in 1993, the year 
she was awarded the Naismith 
College Coach of the Year. She 
has also led Cheyney State 
College (1982) and Rutgers (2000, 
2007) to the Final Four, making 
her the first coach to guide three 
different programs that far in the 
postseason.

In her last 17 seasons in 

Piscataway, Stringer has led 
the Scarlet Knights to 14 NCAA 
Tournaments. And now with 
the thought of national success 
still fresh in Rutgers’ mind, 
Stringer is poised to have another 
memorable season.

But she knows the Big Ten 

won’t be a cakewalk even with 
her team returning all of last 
season’s starters.

“We know that (joining the 

Big Ten is) going to be tough,” 
Stringer said at Big Ten Media 
Day in October. “I can’t think of 
one team that is weak in the Big 
Ten. … We do come with a veteran 
team and one that is itching and 
excited about the possibility of, 

one, qualifying 
for the NCAAs 
and 
(two), 

going 
much 

further.”

Stringer 

said 
that 
in 

the Big Ten, 
the 
scouting 

focus 
would 

need to shift 
from athletes 
to 
coaches. 

By taking a look at Barnes 
Arico — who battled the Scarlet 
Knights many times during her 
10-year stint at St. Joseph’s — 
Stringer will find a fresh coach 
still developing a program. 
Rutgers (1-2, 10-4) will need 
its best players to fight Barnes 
Arico’s hard-pressing strategy 
to overcome its sluggish start to 
the conference schedule.

Despite 
returning 
from 

a 
sprained 
thumb, 
forward 

Betnijah Laney has been the 
Scarlet Knights’ leading scorer 
in their three Big Ten matchups 
thus far. With four players taller 
than her on the roster, Laney has 
managed to become the team’s 
leading rebounder with 163 — 
18 more than Michigan senior 
forward Cyesha Goree, who has 
a four-inch advantage over the 
6-foot Laney.

Rutgers will also look to 

leading 
scorer 
Tyler 
Scaife, 

who is shooting a team-high 50 
percent from beyond the arc 
while averaging 16.6 points per 
game — more than any Wolverine. 
After being ranked the top point 
guard in the country during her 
recruitment, she was named the 
2014 AAC Freshman of the Year 
after a breakout season.

Michigan, meanwhile, is on 

a hot streak. Freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty hit five treys 
against the Spartans, Goree has 
registered five double-doubles in 
her last six games and the team 
has been smooth sailing since 
its last loss, which came against 
Wisconsin on Dec. 28.

But now, Barnes Arico’s team 

will have its hands full against an 
old Eastern foe.
