TAXING PHILANTHROPY
Oba-ma tax policy could hurt'U'

Officials confident
decrease in taxable
* deduction won't
discourage donations
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
President Barack Obama may be
confident about his budget plan for
next year, but his proposal is leav-

ilg some at the University and in
the nonprofit community uneasy
about the impact it could have on
donations.
Because of a tax change out-
lined in Obama's proposed budget
plan, couples making more than
$250,000 jointly each year would
not receive as large of a tax write-
off for donations to nonprofit
organizations, like the University.
Because of this, some on campus
think the University could see
fewer or smaller donations next

year.
Prof. Joel Slemrod, who teaches
business and economics, explained
Obama's proposal by saying it
would cost approximately seven
cents more per dollar for couples
making more than $250,000 to
make a donation.
"If you're in the top bracket and
... you're an itemizer, right now it
costs you 65 cents to give the Uni-
versity of Michigan a dollar," he
said. "Under this proposal, for that
group of people, the cost of giving a

dollar goes up to 72 cents."
In a press conference Tuesday
night, Obama defended the tax
plan saying it would level the play-
ing field so anyone giving a dona-
tion qualifies for the same tax
credit.
"People are still going to be able
to make charitable contributions,"
he said in response to a reporter's
question. "I think it is a realistic
way for us to raise some revenue

At Big House, no more
priority for A2 students

others are working
with administration
to rethink teaching
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
Dave Metler isn't a teacher yet,
but he's already looking for ways
to transform the profession. The
School of Education senior founded
the Michigan Education Reform
Club, which aims to address stu-
dent concerns with the teaching
profession.
Metier said he hopes to create
a space in which education pro-
fessionals and undergraduates in
education can converse about their
own teaching concerns, as well as
compare techniques and ideas for
creating the most stimulating edu-
cational environments.
"I think reform begins with our-
selves first," Metler said. "There is
no consensus in the nation for how
to prepare teachers. I am work-
ing with the club in developing an
assessment of the science of educa-
tion that kind of sets standards for
teacher prep."
He added thatbefore becoming a
successful teacher, one mustmaster
a particular set ofskills and practic-
es, and he hopes that club members
will learnthese skills by interacting
more with their professors.

Flint, Dearborn
students won't get
worse seats after
policy change
By ERIK TORENBERG
For the Daily
This past football season, a
freshman University student had
a better chance of getting a front
row seat to a football game than a
senior from the University's Flint

or Dearborn campuses.
But that won't be the case this
football season.
When students from the Uni-
versity's three campuses - Ann
Arbor, Dearborn and Flint - pur-
chase football season tickets,
which went on sale Tuesday, Ann
Arbor students won't be given pri-
ority over students at the Flint and
Dearborn campuses.
Athletic Department officials
abandoned the policy they issued
last year to give seating priority
to students in Ann Arbor. After
last year's ticketing policy was put

in place, the number of Dearborn
students buying tickets declined
from 900 to 650.
Flint students complained that
the policy did not promote equal-
ity among the students.
The decision to reverse the
policy came after a committee of
12 students from the three schools
told Athletic Department officials
the original policy was unfair.
Marty Bodnar, associate direc-
tor of ticketing services at the Uni-
versity, said treating students from
every school equally is a priority

SIMULATING HUNGER

Big House bonds

Every Saturday in the
fall, Michigan Stadium
plays host to more than
100,000 people. But fund-
ing the project in 1927 was
not as smooth as some may
now suspect.
The Big House opened
its gates for its first game
against Ohio Wesleyan
on 0ct. 1, 1927. By 1951, it
proved itself to he the most
prized and profitable ath-
letic facility for the Univer-
sity of Michigan, according
to the Bentley Historical
Lihrary wehsite.
But hefore it hecame a
University staple, Athletic
Department officials had
to figure out a way to raise
the money to build it. Real-
izing that a new stadium
would increase football
attendance and therefore

increase profits, then-Ath-
letic Director Fielding Yost
began to work in the 1920s
on plans to build a new sta-
dium, accordingnto the weh-
site.
On Aug. 20, 1926, the
Athletic Department
issued 3,000 honda to
6,000 alumni to raise
money to build the new
stadium, according to the
wehsite. Each had a value
of $500 with 3 percent
interest. The hoods, which
featured a picture of a wol-
verine and a guaranteed
two seats at the 20-yard
line for 10 years, were a hit
with alumni.
But Yost still had trouble
selling all of the honda. He
turned no Phil Pack, the
first Athletic Department
publicist, who helped to

sell all the honda by the
season opener of 1927.
From 1927 to 1930, the
Athletic Department had
enough funds to maintain
the regular operations of
the Big House, as well as
fund additional construc-
tion, according to the web-
site.
In 1930, Athletic
Department officials felt
it was time to refund their
bond debt so they selected
550 bonds randomly to be
retired, according to the
website. But the Great
Depression prevented the
University from retir-
ing the rest of its bonds.
Though it could still man-
age to pay its bills, it was
unable to retire any more
bonds until 1927.

Under pressure,
Cockrel goes public
with finances
Mayor Kenneth Cockrel Jr.
has gone public with his person-
al finances under pressure from
opponent Dave Bing, who had said
he'd refuse to debate Cockrel oth-
erwise.
Less than an hour before his
Wednesday night debate against
Bing, Cockrel disclosed that he was
paid $109,000 as City Council pres-
ident and mayor last year, while
his wife Kimberley made $65,000
from the Detroit Public Schools
and Detroit Medical Center.
Cockrel also listed ahome carry-
ing a mortgage balance of $132,973;
two cars; investments including
stocks, mutual funds, retirement
accounts; and college savings
accounts.
Bing released financial state-
ments last fall indicating his worth
is less than $3 million.
Cockrel and Bing, a business-
man and former Detroit Pistons
star, face off May 5 to complete the
term of former Mayor Kwame Kil-
patrick, which expires Dec. 31.

State to help give
cash influx to
automakers
Struggling auto suppliers who
need a quick infusion of cash and
are already receiving state tax cred-
its would get a lump-sum payment
under a plan being considered by
the Michigan House.
The proposal passed Wednesday
by a House committee would give
auto suppliers who already receive
multiyear Michigan Economic
Growth Authority tax credits all the
money up front before 2011. In some
cases, the credits now are provided
over a decade or more.
The proposal is designed to give
financially troubled auto suppli-
ers a cash infusion and give them
an incentive to consolidate their
operations and preserve jobs in
Michigan.
The proposal, which likely soon
will come up for a vote on the House
floor, would be limited so it could
not cost the state more than $250
million. The bill itself does not pro-
vide a way to pay for the program,
but House Speaker Andy Dillon said
I he is working with the state Trea-
sury on a possible mechanism to
avoid costing the state any general
tax revenue. That mechanism could
include a revenue bond that would
bepaid off with revenue from Mich-
igan's main business tax.

mayor face-off

David Bing and
Ken Cockrel Jr.
clash in debate
DETROIT (AP) - The two can-
didates vying for the Detroit may-
or's office outlined their plans to
turnaround the cash-strapped
city in their first one-on-one
debate last night.
During a sometimes fiery event
held in front of a capacity audi-
ence at the Charles H. Wright
Museum of African American
History, businessman Dave Bing
said "Detroit is in a crisis" and he
wants to end the city's failed lead-
ership and restore integrity to the
mayor's office.
Mayor Ken Cockrel Jr. said
Detroit faces "significant challeng-

es" but he's been a calming influ-
ence in city government during his
short time as mayor. He touted the
opening ofpolice mini-stations and
efforts to secure federal stimulus
funds under his watch.
The nearly hour-long program
included questions posed by jour-
nalists from The Detroit News
and Detroit Free Press.
Bing criticized Cockrel's plan
for a 10 percent wage cut and lay-
offs of about 57 workers as a way
to help cut the budget deficit.
"That's a drop in the bucket
relative to the deficit we're fac-
ing," Bing said of the layoffs. "I
think the sense of urgency was
never there. It seems to me that
all we're doing is slowing the
process down so we don't have to
get people angry when we go to
the polls."

Incoming PM says
Israel will be a
"partner for peace"
JERUSALEM (AP) - Incoming
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanya-
hu said Wednesday his government
will be a "partner for peace with
the Palestinians," the latest sign
that the new Israeli leader is soften-
ing his stand as he prepares to take
office next week.
Netanyahu, who has been skepti-
calofpastpeaceefforts,deliveredhis
pledge a day after President Barack
Obama said the U.S. will push for
creation of a Palestinian state.
The prime minister-designate
said he will seek parliamentary
approval for his new government
next week. Then he would take over
as head of a government dominated
by hawkish parties, but potentially
moderated by the presence of the
centrist Labor Party.
Labor has been at the forefront of
Mideast peace efforts, while Netan-
yahu has a record of rebuffing peace

moves that require Israeli conces-
sions. To entice a reluctant Labor
into his coalition, Netanyahu had
to promise to pursue peace with
the Palestinians, but stopped short
of pledgingto work for creation of a
Palestinian state - a cornerstone of
peace plans for more than a decade.
In the campaign before the Feb.
10 election that propelled him
toward the premiership, Netan-
yahu disparaged talks on a peace
treaty, saying the proper approach
was to first build up the Palestinian
economy.
Palestinian leaders rejected
that, and during her visit here this
month, Secretary of State' Hillary
Rodham Clinton made a point of
calling for creation of a Palestinian
state at every opportunity.
That set up a possible head-on
clash between Israel and its most
powerful allybutNetanyahuinsists
this won't happen and put a positive
face on the situation in a speech to
a joint Israeli-Palestinian economic
conference.
Peace is a "common and endur-
ing goal for all Israelis and Israeli

governments, mine included,"
Netanyahu said. "This means I
will negotiate with the Palestinian
Authority for peace."
He said the Palestinians "should
understand that they have in our
government a partner for peace, for
security, for the rapid development
of the Palestinian economy."
In the West Bank, officials in
the Western-backed government
of President Mahmoud Abbas were
skeptical, andspokesmanNabilAbu
Rdeneh dismissed Netanyahu's call
for economic development.
"Any solutions with other slo-
gans and titles are only an attempt
to escape the commitments of the
peace process," he said, listing the
main issues in negotiations for a
state: borders, settlements and
Jerusalem.
At a news conference Tuesday,
Obama said the makeup of the
new Israeli government was still
unclear, and peacemaking is "not
easier than it was, but I think it's
just as necessary."
Besides Labor, Netanyahu's main
partner is Yisrael Beitenu.

If print goes extinct
Journalistic integrity will decline as newspapers go online
Thanks to a failing economy and a slumping market for
print journalism, the city of Ann Arbor will soon lose one
of its oldest public patrons. The Ann Arbor News, which
has served the city as its primary daily newspaper since 1835, plans
to shut its doors in July. While the paper will still publish stories
online, its print version will only exist on Thursday and Sundays
in a format that is still unclear. This comes with serious ramifica-
tions for the state of news coverage in Ann Arbor. Print newspapers
like The Ann Arbor News serve a vital purpose that can't always be
fulfilled on online, and readers both in Ann Arbor and across the
country must realize that the decline of print journalism is bad for
responsible reporting.

'Fair trade'tragedy

With the growth of the Internet, the
number of advertisers still looking to
invest in print resources is declining. The
Internet is perceived as more convenient to
readers with its constant updates and easy
access. Due to this trend, The Ann Arbor
News, like many other newspapers in the
industry, will publish primarily online.
While it's fortunate that the newspaper
isn't facing complete extinction, it's likely
that much of the staff will be left unem-
ployed and that on the whole, the Ann
Arbor community will be less exposed to
local news coverage.
When at its best, the Ann Arbor News
served a strong public purpose by inves-
tigating and reporting on local news that
affected its residents. While the quality
declined as the newspaper struggled to
stay afloat during the past few years, it's
reasonable to think that few media orga-
nizations will be able to completely fill the
News's shoes anytime soon. That's a shame
for this city.
This reality is even more disheartening
because of the state of newspapers across
the country. The shrinking of the num-
ber of available newspapers leaves those
that do survive with a responsibility to
fill the coverage gaps. This forces them to
become less specialized and obligates them

to report on a greater number of issues,
diluting content. This, in combination with
decreasing competition in the daily news-
paper market, threatens the overall quality
and value of the existing papers. Part of the
benefit of having many newspapers is that
they must compete to offer their readers
the most reliable, detailed and vigilant cov-
erage. Diminished competition results in
the same thing that happens in other mar-
kets- alower-quality product.
Arguably, those who still care about the
city will seek out news from the Internet,
and it's good that newspapers can still sur-
vive in this medium. But the self-filtering
quality of online news coverage is problem-
atic. When readers search for news in mas-
sive databases, it's likely they will choose to
read only the news that already confirms
their own beliefs. This results in a populace
that is less informed and, ultimately, more
bitterly polarized.
As newspapers like The Ann Arbor News
rapidly approach their final days, readers
must be aware that print journalism serves
a necessary purpose in society that can't
always be replaced by simply moving online.
Vigilant, objective and responsible coverage
necessitates competition among print news-
papers. As the saying goes, don't believe
everything you read on the Internet.

ot too long ago, I was walk-
ing across the Diag and saw
a group of students speak-
ing out (very loud-
ly) against child
labor. I respect the
desire to prevent
minors from hav-
ing to work, but to:,
call for an outright
end to child labor is
absurd.
I agree that
in a few specific IBRAHIM
cases, there are KAKWAN
problems with the
practice. In central
Congo, for example, children work
in diamond mines for under a dollar
a day. They are surrounded by guns
and unstable mud walls, and many
are killed. But on the whole, child
labor provides an avenue for mil-
lions around the world to survive. It
may not be progressive or ideal, but
it keeps them alive and can be much
better than the alternatives. Plus, it
makes things cheaper for Americans.
Sometimes, it's better to make soc-
cer balls than to be on the streets or
forced into prostitution. In the mid
'90s, a UNICEF study found that an
international boycott of Nepali rugs
that aimed to stem child labor result-
ed in the loss of several thousand fac-
tory jobs held by children. Many of
these children, mostly girls, wound
up as prostitutes.
In the late 1980's, the Bangladeshi
textile industry (which today employs
thousands of children) was still
under development, and many chil-
dren were on the streets as beggars,
prostitutes or hard laborers. With the
expansion of the textile industry and
the emergence of sweatshops, many
of these children were taken off the
streets. If there is any doubt that
child labor was responsible for this
positive change, then an Oxfam study
illustrates the consequences of facto-
ry closures: in one case, up to 30,000
children lost their jobs, many became
prostitutes and some even starved.

The factories were closed in response
to international discontent with their
use of child labor.
What needs to be understood is
that the alternative to work is not
school or a "normal" childhood. If
activists force the closure of factories
employing children, then the chil-
dren will suffer. If there is no work,
there is no food. The children know
this, so they will take whatever work
manifests itself.
There are also less savory forms of
child labor, but even those can pro-
vide salvation in desperate situations.
It's possible that parents may place
their children into indentured ser-
vitude. Often, this results in exploi-
tation of the children, but in many
places it functions as a last resort. A
typical arrangement will involve a
(low) lump sum payment to the fam-
ily in return for a 2-3 year period of
work from the child. If a family is
faced by hardship - a debt, backed
rent or parents who are temporarily
incapacitated - such an agreement
can keep the entire family off the
streets, including the child.
This is part of the reason why indi-
viduals who choose to boycott firms
or products that involve the use of
child labor may unintentionally be
harming the children. A multination-
al company is probably among the
best possible employers for a child.
The wages tend to be more regular
and are generally higher than the
local alternatives. Plus, there is no
danger of indentured servitude. Even
the adults.benefit: when a big factory
opens, the local demand for labor
increases, and so can wages. In most
cases, sweatshop wages even exceed
the local average.
And don't be fooled by companies
that promote "fair trade." At the end
of the day, if a company has a slogan
thatemphasizes its"no-sweat"stance,
then it's simply attempting a different
approach to product differentiation.
Buying from such a company doesn't
actually help the individuals who
are in sweatshops - it just makes the

buyers feel better about themselves,
allows them to "make a statement"
and drains their pockets. It also
diverts business from employers who
keep children off the streets.
How child labor
actually saves
kids' lives.

6

On a larger scale, the movement
against anti-child labor can become
entangled with protectionism. It is all
too easy for an industry to seek pro-
tection by lobbying to limit imports
under the veil of promoting chil-
dren's rights. Better yet, it is not only
politically correct, but can improve a
company's image in the eyes ofawell-
intentioned public. Of course, there is
no real benefit to those abroad - on
the contrary, any import restrictions
will only result in the children losing
their jobs and livelihoods.
If you drink Coca-Cola, know
that the sugar may have come from
a plantation in El Salvador, employ-
ing a contingent of child laborers. But
be happy: you have done your part to
prevent those kids from joining vio-
lent gangs like MS-13 or 18th Street.
My family is from that country, and
let me tell you, it does make a differ-
ence. I remember watching an old
lady have her head bashed open in a
grocery store, presumably by a gang
member.
When children as young as seven
are being recruited by these same
people to traffic drugs or engage in
gang warfare, labor provides a safe
alternative. It's a win-win: the chil-
dren are safe and paid, the multina-
tionals make money and it can even
prevent crime.

Educating from the bottom

Avoiding anti-Semitism

President Barack Obama has certainly taken
his Bob-the-Builder philosophy to heart. "Can
we fix it? Yes we can!" Unfortunately, while he
seems to be trying to attack each problem indi-
vidually, I'm not convinced that his education
policy will make the cut. Obama's most recent
speech discussing education policy took place
on Mar. 10. His speech was great, as we can usu-
ally expect, and he engaged his audience. In it,
he outlined five different "pillars" that he would
like to see implemented in his education policy.
As a tutor for America Reads, I am all too
aware of the increasing education gap in Ameri-
ca's schools. Not only are American schools fall-
ing behind the rest of the world, but inner-city
and other under-privileged schools are falling
behind the rest of America. One of the bestways
to improve this inconsistency is to help students
improve the foundation of their education. You
can't teach children algebra without first teach-
ing them addition.
Thankfully, Obama's first pillar focuses on
investing tax money in lower elementary and
preschool programs. This is an excellent area
on which to concentrate, since our elementary
schools and younger children are often neglect-
ed. This is partially because of the increasing
financial crisis for higher education. As Obama
stated, we save $10 for every dollar invested
in childhood education programs. This extra
money could, in the long run, be put toward
higher education.
But saving money and helping younger chil-
dren is only one-fifth of the plan Obama wants
to implement. The other four-fifths attend to
other education problems like the financial cri-
sis for higher education. Obama wants to make
sure that every kid has the chance to attend
college, partially by providing better financial
aid. The problem with this plan is that it leaves
children at a distinct disadvantage. There is
no point in sending everyone to college if they
never learned the fundamental skills in elemen-
tary school.
The rest of the plan, as outlined by Obama,
also sounded a little reminiscent of former Pres-
ident George W. Bush's policies. Obama decided
to set up a system of accountability and fix No
Child Left Behind, which is arguably one of the
worst plans ever implemented by the govern-
ment. What Obama doesn't seem to realize is
that we already have a system of accountability
that places unbending and misrepresentative
academic requirements on schools, teachers

and, most importantly, elementary school stu-
dents. I would be more bolstered by Obama's
plan if he could outline how he plans to change
the assessments used to determine who is doing
well and who is doing poorly.
Once Obama has changed these regulations,
he needs to also recognize that when schools
- usually inner-city and under-privileged -
cannot make the grade, the worst thing to do is
simply cut funding. The current plan has arbi-
trary rules that cause schools that most need
funding to lose it.
This plan aims to change the current system
by putting the states in charge of education. But,
again, one major problem with the current sys-
tem is that states all have different standards. Of
course, Obama mentioned state accountability
with the same breath he also used to talk about
inconsistent regulations that need to be changed
at a federal level. It is not currently clear at what
level the regulations will be implemented, but it
should be a federal system of accountability.
Unfortunately, Obama will only give his new
Early Learning Challenge Grant to states that
have demonstrated a concrete plan to fix the
quality of their programs. But what does this
mean for Michigan - a state so failing in its
economy that it can't fix its budget, let alone
establish programs for early learning? If Obama
can talk about inconsistent state regulations,
he should also be able to set up a federal plan to
help the states and schools who are falling into
the cracks.
And most importantly, a working system
of accountability can only be realized once all
schools have the tools and ability to meet the
standards. Teachers can't keep teaching to tests
and hoping that students will be able to perform
the same in all areas of the country. This system
is cyclical and perpetuates what the Obama calls
a "race to the bottom."
Once we have improved the state of lower
education, we can finally focus on allowing
everyone to have an opportunity to get higher
education. As a college student, I would love
to see the cost of tuition go down. But Obama
is not necessarily talking about lowering that
cost - he just wants to make sure everyone has
a chance to pay the bill. That will only happen
when all students are taught effectively at the
elementary level. You wouldn't build a house by
starting with the roof.

n a campus with roughly 6,000
Jewish students, identifying as
a Jew isn't something I usually
worry about. Anti-
Semitism is largely
a topic for lecture
halls rather than a
fact of everyday life.
But in the past few
months, particular-
ly during the recent
violence in the Gaza
Strip, I have expe-
rienced a torrent of MATTHEW
bitter arguments GREEN
about my support of
Israel. -
To be sure, dis-
agreeing with the Jewish state is not
the same as hating Jews. There is a
nuanced distinction between anti-Zi-
onism and anti-Semitism, and indeed,
many Jews take issue with Zionism.
But the lines are blurry. Particularly
in attempts to embolden otherwise
legitimate arguments against Israel,
students occasionally support their
opinions with unintentional anti-Jew-
ish sentiment.
"The U.S. only supports Israel," I
have been told, "because American
Jews control Washington." Ignorant
remarks likethis one are especially dis-
appointing as they serve to dilute very
real concerns about Israeli politics.
Those concerns are moreover under-
mined because condemning Israel as a
nation of bigoted jingoists has become
the latest posh opinion of leftist pseu-
do-intellectuals.
Even when the Israel debate steers
clear from cultural epithets and chic
cluelessness, the dialogue generally
follows the same script. Opponents
insist that Israeli statehood goes
against the natural order of the region,
arguing that Israel denies basic rights
to Palestinians while accepting too
much money from the U.S., among
other concerns. Israel supporters then
assert that it's a thriving democracy
in the Middle East, a loyal ally of the

United States and that it has the right
to defend itself from countless enemies
in the region. The debate is an exhaust-
ed war of words and leaves little room
for consensus.
Clearly, Israel needs to be more
responsive to the humanitarian needs
of Palestinians rendered powerless by
poverty. Israel's actions in Gaza this
winter had understandable intentions
but also exemplified an Israeli callous-
ness that shocked many in the West. As
the rightist administration of Benja-
min Netanyahu likely comes to power
in Israel, it must be open-minded to all
possibilities on the path toward peace.
It has to prove the world wrong.
If you don't like Israeli politics, keep
in mind that there's a way to criticize
it without calling for its destruction
or resorting to anti-Semitic slurs. See
the above paragraph for an example.
Emotions and an overall disregard for
pragmatism have gotten the best of
people in the throes of this philosophi-
cal debate, and it's time to stop raising
the same talking points.
I'm not worried that Israel-bashing
will morph into a new wave of anti-
Semitism. But I'm sad to see discussion
focused solely around conflict when
there is so much else to talk about and
so much to love about Israel. Blinded
by one element of Israeli politics, the
world neglects to see the seemingly
impossible accomplishments achieved
by the Jewish state in only 61 years of
existence. From a barren desert, the
first Israelis built a modern nation that
enjoys a Western standard of living.
While the American economy may
be lucky to grow at all this year, the
Israeli economy continues to grow at a
rate of roughly 4 percent, according to
the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Much of this growth is a result of enor-
mous Israeli investment in technology
that has given the world the cell phone,
AOL Instant Messenger and the ingest-
ible video camera used in colonosco-
pies.Thestudyofmedicine,specifically,
has been significantly advanced by the

ingenuity of Israeli hospitals and tech-
nology. But the Israeli story does not
end there.
Criticism of Israeli
politics shouldn't
turn to hatred.

6

Before becoming the second nation
in modern history to elect a female
head of government, Israel addressed
equal rights for women in the early
1950s, a decade before the United
States had the same dialogue. In addi-
tion, Israel is the only nation on the
planet that entered the new millen-
nium with a net gain of trees, thanks
to efforts bythe Jewish National Fund.
In fact, the overall dedication Israel
has shown toward environmentalism
- from water conservation to reducing
air pollution - is unparalleled, particu-
larly amongyoungnations.
Yet more importantly, Israel is the
cultural and spiritual homeland of a
people spat upon by the world since
its genesis. All biblical or religious rea-
soning aside, the Jews deserve a home.
Jews have clung to books and bagels in
the world's cities and villages for most
of their existence. A definite homeland
has beenthe missingpuzzle pieceinthe
collective Jewish psyche for too long. 6
Nevertheless, that doesn't give Israelis
the right to deny anything to Palestin-
ians. Rather, Jewish past should give
Israelis an understanding of what it
means to be evicted from history.
So disagree with the Israeli gov-
ernment, by all means. Just don't get
carried away with blind, categorical
assertions - because when you do,
your opinions are only extra shrapnel
in the conflict.

Santander's mental
focus key for Michigan

ARIEL BOND/Daily
Sophomore Aaron Palushaj has scored three goals and notched seven assists in the Michigan hockey team's past six games.
Palushaj hot a ain
after midseason lull

By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
For some gymnasts, it's a good
sign when the crowd goes wild
after pulling off a particular skill.
But when junior Mel Santander
is in perfectform, he often inspires
an awed, breathless silence. His
graceful lines are unmistakable as
he pulls off skills that seem physi-
cally impossible. And the crowd
seems almost afraid to move, as
if it might somehow spoil the per-
fection.
"He has fantastic basics and
gorgeous lines," senior Scott Breg-
man said. "When he's able to hold
onto both of those when he does
hard skills, he makes some of the
most difficultthings look easy and
beautiful. ... You watch it and you
go, 'That's pure. That's what you
want it to look like.' "
And to succeed, all Santander
has to do is get out of his own way.
Santander, who was voted Michi-
gan's MVP by his teammates last
season, tends to put unreasonable
pressure on himself. That's usu-
ally the case at the annual Win-
ter Cup competition in February.
Until this year, Santander had
bowed out on the first night of
competition.
This season, Santander wanted
to make the second day so much
that he stressed himself out of
a great performance on the first
night. But he still qualified for the
second round - where, all of a
sudden, the pressure was off.
"It felt like another, 'Oh, here's
anotheryearI'mnotgoingto make
second day again,' " Santander
said. "Kind of depressing. But
after knowing that I made second
day, itnkind of made me realize that
I was sort of good. I was decent.
Then, second day, I had nothing to
lose. I just wanted to show every-
body what I can do."
On that second day of competi-
tion, he proved he was more than
simply decent. Among the best
gymnasts in the country, San-
tander finished fifth on pommel

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
Over the past two seasons, he's
tallied 71 assists, the most in the
country - and he's just a sopho-
more.
But in the first 14 games of 2009,
that was barely apparent.
After representing the United
States in the World Junior Cham-
pionships in late December, for-
ward Aaron Palushaj tallied points
in just six contests.
The playmaker didn't complete-
ly fall off in production - he just
wasn't the player most were used
to seeing on the ice.
"I didn't really get too much of a
break there when I went to World
Juniors - it was kind of a grind
that whole month while everybody
was resting," Palushaj said. "So I
came back those few weeks after
and I wasn't myself.
"I think it was just ... my lack
of effort just because I was so
exhausted those weeks coming
back."
Even more taxing may have
been the mental battle of playing
in the high-pressure champion-
ships, in which the United States
placed fifth.
"You try to serve your country
well, then you come back without a
medal (and) it's kind of a little dev-
astating," Palushaj said. "Truth
is, after we came back, we played
Miami (Ohio) twice, and it's a com-
pletely different level of play. You
really don't want to play hockey
the next few days."
Palushaj elected to jump right

back into the lineup instead of
taking time off when he returned
to the Wolverines. He even got on
the board with a pair of assists in
his first game back, but Palushaj
noticed he wasn't moving his feet
well enough, skating hard enough
or passing the puck crisply enough.
Those were his best attributes in
the first half of the season, when
he led Michigan in points with
eight goals and 17 assists.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
saw Palushaj return with less con-
fidence than when he left to don
the USA sweater in Ottawa, Ont.
"They're in a different situation
with different players and coach-
es," Berenson said about players
leaving to play in the champion-
ships. "They're chosen on the team
but sometimes they don't get used
the way they get used here. They
come back second-guessing them-
selves. We've had kids leave here
when they were leading our team
in scoring and then they hardly
play on the world junior team, for
one reason or another.
"We've supported the program,
but it hasn't always been a win-win
for our players."
After three or four weeks,
Palushaj again began to look like
his normal self on the ice.
And in the final weekend of the
regular season, the points started
pouring in, with Palushaj nabbing
two assists against Ferris State at
the start of a hot six-game streak.
In the last six games, Palushaj
has lit the lamp three times and
assisted seven goals. Berenson
said the sophomore is close to

where he was in the beginning of
the season when he "started like a
house afire."
Palushaj's greatly improved
defensive play is a major reason
he has improved from a plus-10
forward last year to one boasting a
plus-25 plus-minus ratio this sea-
son. The coaching staff is seeing
him buy into Michigan's empha-
sis of playing strongly without the
puck.
"We rarely recruit a player
strictly because he's good defen-
sively," Berenson said. "We recruit
a player because he's good offen-
sively, or he's got the smarts, or he's
got a great combination of skills, a
package of skills. Then we'll teach
them how to play without the puck
if he doesn't know. Most of them
don't know."
And reuniting with his line-
mates from last year, sophomores
Matt Rust and Carl Hagelin, cer-
tainly helps, too.
Alongside his classmates,
Palushaj put up six points in the
NCAA Tournament last season,
including three assists in the Fro-
zen Four.
"When they got Palushaj back,
it was like getting an old family
member back in the fold," Beren-
son said. "Then they produced as
well."
Palushaj realizes his role as a
playmaker, and his confidence is
finally back up to normal after a
mid-season lull.
"t've just been playing hard,"
Palushaj said. "That's why I think
the points have been coming late-
ly."

horse.
Santander's development hasn't
gone unnoticed, either. Michigan
assistant coach Derek Croad has
seen dramatic changes in San-
tander since his freshman year,
when Santander was one of the
most reserved athletes the Michi-
gan men's gymnastics team had
ever seen. On his recruiting trip,
he was so shy that he sometimes
didn't even respond to questions.
Now Santander has become
even more motivated in the gym
and has enjoyed himself outside
the sport, too.
"When it comes to gym, I have
not seen him more intense than
this year, how concentrated he is
at what he does, how focused he
is on any corrections," Croad said.
"You really can't see him getting
distracted at all. When he start-
ed off, he could have been easily
distracted. ... He's matured into a
very good young man and a good
athlete."
And he has come out of his shell.
From being the kid who didn't
speak up, he's become almost a
chatterbox who amazes his team-

mates with his side talent of danc-
ing. Bregman said he often tiptoes
past Santander's room in hopes of
catching his housemate practicing
new moves.
The mental pressure of the
sport might stillbe problematic for
the junior. But as the postseason
approaches, the Southborough,
Mass., native's physical prowess
could make up for it. Against Illi-
nois, he hit his most difficult high
bar routine for the first time. In
Michigan's recent win in Colum-
bus, he hit four of his five sets,
including his trademark routines
on pommel horse and parallel
bars.
He's capable ofcompetinginthe
all-around along with sophomores
Chris Cameron and Thomas Kel-
ley, and Santander's scores will be
a key part of Michigan's Big Ten
title run two weekends from now.
"Mel used to be the guy where
he got up and you had no freaking
clue what was going to happen,"
Croad said. "You just sat there
and prayed to God that he would
stay on. Now, it's the opposite. We
know he's going to hit."

African-American scholar dies State senators

Author who penned
'From Slavery to
Freedom' passed
away at 94
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - John
Hope Franklin, a towering scholar
and pioneer of African-American
studies who wrote the seminal
text on the black experience in the
U.S. and worked on the landmark
Supreme Court case that outlawed
public school segregation, died
yesterday. He was 94.
David Jarmul, a spokesman at
Duke University, where Franklin
taught for a decade .and was pro-
fessor emeritus of history, said he
died of congestive heart failure at
the school's hospital in Durham.
Born and raised in an all-black
community in Oklahoma where he
was often subjected to humiliating
racism, Franklin was later instru-
mental in bringing down the legal
and historical validations of such a
world.
As an author, his book "From
Slavery to Freedom" was a land-
mark integration of black history
intoAmericanhistorythatremains
relevant more than 60 years after
being published. As a scholar, his
research helped Thurgood Mar-
shall and his team at the NAACP
win Brown v. Board of Education,
the 1954 case that barred the doc-
trine of "separate but equal" in the
nation's public schools.
"It was evident how much the
lawyers appreciated what the his-
torians could offer," Franklin later
wrote. "For me, and I suspect the
ALUMNI

who have been affected by (the
economy), and they're looking for
anything or anyone that they can
turn to help them out."
According to an Alumni Asso-
ciation press release about the
Economic Hardship Fund, traf-
fic to career-related pages on the
Alumni Association's website has
increased about 32 percent since
December.
Alumni Association member-
ships are normally $64 per year
and provide members with ben-
efits like discounts on cell phones
and computers.
Sigler said depending on the
response from alumni donating to
the Economic Hardship Fund, the
Alumni Association might provide
emergency loans to alumni in dire
need.
Sigler added that in addition to

same was true for the others, it
was exhilarating."
Franklinhimselfbrokenumerous
color barriers. He was the first black
department chair at a predominant-
ly white institution, Brooklyn Col-
lege; the first black professor to hold
an endowed chair at Duke; and the
first black presidentof the American
Historical Association.
He often regarded his country
like an exasperated relative, frus-
trated by racism's stubborn power,
yet refusing to give up. "I want to
be outthere on the firing line, help-
ing, directing or doing something
to try to make this a better world, a
better place to live," Franklin told
The Associated Press in 2005.
InNovember, after BarackObama
broke the ultimate racial barrier in
American politics, Franklin called
his ascension to the White House
"one of the most historic moments,
if not the most historic moment, in
the history ofthis country."
"Because of the life John Hope
Franklin lived, the public service he
rendered, and the scholarship that
was the mark of his distinguished
career, we all have a richer under-
standingofwhowe are asAmericans
and our journey as a people," Obama
said in a statement. "Dr. Franklin
will be deeply missed, but his legacy
is one that will surely endure."
Obama's achievement fit with
Franklin's mission as a historian,
to document how blacks lived
and served alongside whites from
the nation's birth. Black patriots
fought at Lexington and Concord,
Franklin pointed out in "From
Slavery to Freedom," published in
1947. They crossed the Delaware
with Washington and explored
the Economic Hardship Fund, the
Alumni Association is also devel-
oping a series of networking events
over the nextfew months, including
one that was held Tuesday in Chi-
cago. Other upcoming networking
events include ones in Flint, Detroit
and potentially, New York.
"We're looking right now at
the primary areas that we can be
helpful with - the career services,
networking, volunteering and get-
ting the alumni network to help
support each other and looking at
some other benefits that we offer
that might help alumni save some
money right now," Sigler said.
Sigler said the Alumni Asso-
ciation has also had conversations
with alumni associations from
other Big Ten schools about col-
laborating on a future networking
event or job fair.
The events the Alumni Asso-
ciation is hosting now are geared
toward helping alumni find jobs

with Lewis and Clark.
The book sold more than 3.5 mil-
lion copies and remains required
reading in college classrooms. It was
based on research Franklin con-
ducted in libraries and archives that
didn't allow him to eat lunch or use
the bathroom because he was black.
"He was working in a profes-
sion that more or less banned him
opment. In addition, Sigler said
the Alumni Association has also
increased its career counseling
programming to provide career
advice to alumni struggling in
today's job market.
In order to gauge the need for
their services, the Alumni Associa-
tion recently surveyed its members
about their current career situa-
tions, and 5 percent responded say-
ing they are currently unemployed
and actively looking for a job, said
Kathy Noble, vice president of
research, new product develop-
ment and program implementation
for the Alumni Association.
Noblealsosaid37percentofmem-
berssaidthey arecurrentlyemployed
but worried about their job security.
"We really hear the pain
throughout our alumni and rec-
ognize the hardship that this
economy is causing," Sigler said.
"We want to be as responsive and
responsible and want to help them
leverage the strength of the Uni-

at the outset and ended up its lead-
ing practitioner," said Tim Tyson,
a history professor at Duke. "And
yet, he always managed to keep his
grace and his sense of humor."
Late in life, Franklin received
more than 130 honorary degrees
and the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple's Spingarn Award.
versity and the strength of Alumni
Association network to help get
them through this troublingtime."
Doug Baruchin, director of
operations for MyWorkster.com,
a career-networking site for col-
leges and universities, said he has
also seen an increase in requests
for services. In the past six to nine
months, website registration has
increased by 1,500 percent, he said.
"What's happening is so many
people are all vying for the same
jobs," Baruchin said. "People are
looking for whatever possible
advances they can get."
MyWorkster.com links alumni
working in various industries to
alumni from the same schools
looking for jobs.
"And one of the things that we
do is we enable them to stay in
touch with people from their uni-
versity and who works at a specific
company so they can actually get
their foot in the door that way,"
Baruchin said.

Where the kitchen and the closet collide

Just as fashion has its "haute
couture," food has its own
"haute nourriture." Both
share amore
humble culture
characterized
by discreet style
choices for fash-
ion or simple but
delectable mid-
night dishes for KARA
food. And going MORRIS
beyond the cul-
tural parallels, there are more con-

crete connections between food and
fashion on campus. But first, let's
explore the intangible characteris-
tics that relate the two cultures.
Fashion doesn't have to be
haute couture. It doesn't have to
be designer names or expensive
watches, and it doesn't have to
make you feel like you're not cool
enough to write about it. You might
have heard: Fashion is a means of
self-expression.
Sure, you'll find those students
who actually wear those quirky,

straight-off-the-high-fashion-run-
way outfits. Others dress unyield-
ingly to their stereotype - hipster,
conservative, punk, prep - or just
pick up on current trends.
Consider black nail polish.
Before its recent rise to style, it was
worn as an act of rebellion. One
might even say that it was in its tru-
est form of self-expression before
everyone started wearing it.
But some don't pay attention
to clothing choices at all. Plenty
of people are content with an

unkempt mane, jeans and a sweat-
shirt - the my-work-is-more-
important-than-my-style look.
Regardless of whether you're actu-
ally trying to say something, you're
still making a statement. Even
though you may not have heard of
Dior or Yves saint Laurent, when
you dress yourself, you express
yourself-- and that is fashion.
Like fashion, food also has an
expensive side. Why is caviar so
revered? Is it really that delectable?
No. It's expensive and wild and
showy, just like some elements of
high fashion. Though you might
enjoy celebrating the high points
of food, you don't need to eat some
gourmet chef's two seared scal-
lops with a grass blade garnish for
dinner to be satisfied.
Good food doesn't have to be
fancy or daunting. A simple pasta
carbonara dish with freshly grated
Parmesan cheese and enough
warm bacon bits will satisfy you
and your roommates on a late Sat-
urday night. Even Gourmet maga-
zine, a Cond6 Nast publication
that features "haute nourriture,"
has found its humble roots in its
fervor for food politics and in W.
Hodding Carter's "Extreme Fru-
gality" series.
So that was the intangible con-
nection - but how and when do
food and self-expression literally
collide on campus? Just take a
look at Ann Arbor's party scene.
I've always thought that the best
parties are those that involve food
and require guests to arrive in cos-

tume, threatening dire consequenc-
es for those who don't. We have
our highlighter, toga, foam and
stoplight parties, as well as our food
gatherings: tailgates, barbecues and
dinner parties. Every so often these
events blissfully combine into a
costume-food party.
One of my favorite parties was a
friend's autumn "lumberjacks and
flapjacks" party. Attendees donned
flannel shirts and construction
paper axes and consumed pancakes
alongside their warm spiced cider
drinks. Guests explored their lum-
berjack alter ego through costume
and further expressed themselves
by getting into character. The party
was thrown by a friend of mine who
enjoys the intricacies of good food,
but who also revels in the pleasure
of sharing more simplistic foods
with friends.
Another party that invited
friends in costume for a bite to eat
Dressed to
digest.
was a white-trash deer roast put
on by a house of Men's Glee Club
members and a neighboring house
of students who enjoyed hunting.
The food of the hour, venison, was
wild and maybe slightly showy,
but it was meant to be shared and
enjoyed.
For the ultimate mix of food
and fashion, I recommend a
food-costume party of your
own. Scrap your "everything but
clothes" party for an "anything
as long as it's food" event. Think
of the Hershey's challenge from
"Project Runway," where contes-
tants visited the Hershey's store
in Times Square and had to dress
their models in candy wrappers
and Twizzlers. I once dressed up
as "Princess Lolly" from Candy-
land, and glued oven-flattened
lollipops to a homemade dress.
Although I brought extra lol-
lipops for hungry partygoers,
a friend still took a bite out of
ny candy crown. So watch out
for that: Don't make your outfit
too delectable or you may walk
home wearing a lot less than you
arrived in.
Morris made a dress entirely
out of roasted ham hocks and
gelatin. If you want a bite, e-mail

NELSON
From Page 6B
ca - moved around a lot, and
her designs display her ability to
combine fashion influences from
all over the world. A short-sleeve
sweatshirt in the new collection
displays' her interpretation of a
Nigerian Ife bronze head. The
sculpture is made with ridges
pulled out in the sweatshirt to
make lines that cross over the left
shoulder. Where the lines end on
the back, she placed the number
"27,000,000" - the estimated
number of people forced into
slavery all over the world today.
"I want things to be not too
dense, but not too shallow," Nel-
son said of her clothing.
One of Nelson's personal favor-
ite pieces is a pair of brightpurple
and yellow high waist shorts. The
shorts feature details including
material-covered buttons and a
pull-away flap. On the inside of
the flap is a Maya Angelou quote:
"Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise that
I dance like I've got diamonds
at the meeting of my thighs?" A
small diamond image lies in the
cuff of the shorts.
"I'm first a graphic designer,
before a fashion designer," said
Nelson, who makes all of her
own patterns starting with hand-'
drawn sketches.
She then scans images - pho-
tographs, prints from art books or
handwritten messages - and uses
Adobe Photoshop and Illustra-
tor to make a final design before
screen-printing it onto plain fab-
rics like jersey.
"To succeed here, you really
need to push down the wall to
do what you want to do," Nelson
said.
She's proven that she's capable
of doing exactly that, and one can
only guess what she'll be up to
come May. But there's no doubt
that she'll keep producing origi-
nal creations and staying ahead
of fashion trends while always
stayingtrue to what's Beneeth.

a community - they keep a blog
on their website, which they use
for sharing art, music and fash-
ion links. By keeping the brand
locally based, STROKE has a
personal connection with its
customers.
According to Sulaka, STROKE

SCHUMAKER
From Page 6B
her website, junimadethisforyou.
etsy.com, Schumaker features
designs that range from a long black
jacket with a gigantic hood to cuffs
with practical pockets that the
wearer could actually fitthings in.
"I got the idea (for the cuffs)
from a friend who kept losing his
guitar picks - like three or four a
day," she said. "I think pockets are
key and I also like drawstrings so
that people of all sizes can buy the
same garment. Versatility is really
important as well."
Using recycled vintage fabrics
is not only an economic move on
Schumaker's part, but also an envi-
ronmentally friendly one.
"I live in a co-op, and we're very
much into being sustainable - we
recycle and reuse a lot of things,"
Schumaker said.

One garment that's a prime
example of the designer's philoso-
phy of recycling and reusing is the
All Tied Up Skirt.
"Someone gave me a bunch of
neckties and I was trying to fig-
ure what I could do with them,"
she explained. "I started laying
them side by side and realized that
they're tapered like a skirt."
During school, Schumaker is
content working on new projects,
like a dress with about 30 different
pieces of fabric and lace in it.
"It's very piecy and fabulous -
I'm really excited about it," Schu-
maker said. "Some of (the design
style) is recreating, taking it a little
from here and there, and then put-
ting it all together. It's like a 'Fran-
ken-dress' I suppose."
With her focus on recycling and
versatility, Schumaker is commit-
ted to producing fashion that is
friendly to both the environment
and the consumer.

Rediscovering our roots
By Whitney Pow I Senior Arts Editor

America has always been
nostalgic for Americans.
Beneath all the current
social, political and cultural ruckus,
there seems to always be an ideal-
ized America in our past that we
constantly try to revisit. We see this
urge to reconnect with the past in
our need to go to Encore to update
collections of already obsolete vinyl
records, to dirty our fingers on
typewriter ribbons while we tap on
manual typewriters, to pine for the.
apple pie we return to as a symbol of
America as much as a tasty dessert
- Don McLean would agree.
We can see this American nostal-
gia even more intimately through
the clothing trends we revisit.
There are closets full of styles that
have seen the light of day not once
but twice. These styles include
bleached bell bottoms, headbands
and long, flowing hair as well as

checkered shoes, skinny ties and
cheap plastic Ray-Bans.
Today, it seems like the newest
fashion trend revisits blue jeans,
plaid shirts, cowboy boots, high-
top shoes and red, white and blue -
Americana chic. The style surfaced
in the late '40s and early '50s and,
this time around, we are revisit-
ing Americana without irony or
kitsch; we are honest-to-god try-
ing to emulate the feel of that era
in our clothing and, of course, in
the way we view and try to present
ourselves.
Why are we attracted to Ameri-
cana? The look is rustic and work-
ing-class; it's earthy and grounded,
playing off the traditional patterns
and colors that symbolize an histor-
ical, ideal sense of individuality and
the preference of labor and utilitari-
anism over the more recently popu-
lar trend of cultural froth and foam

- everyone's 15 minutes of fame had
been spent on superficial carica-
tures on realitytelevisionshows and
drunken paparazzi photographs.
Our attraction to Americana
might reveal our efforts to connect
with the essentials of living with
manual labor and the land - things

to sustain themselves. This con-
nects people more closely with the
products they consume (don't eat
out - make your own food; don't
throw it out - reuse), re-iterating
a growing sense of self-awareness
and the individual drive to sustain
oneself.

garments.
Schumaker's interest in clothes began when she needed
a prom dress in high school.
"My mom made a dress for me a couple years before,"
Schumaker said with a chuckle. "She said that she wasn't
going to do it again and that I had to do it. It was very '50s
and it was bad, but that's where it started."
After improving her skills, Schumaker has begun selling
her pieces online, in addition to taking custom orders. On

And perhaps our movement
toward Americana aesthetics has

ashiioning tion with the present. Maybe it's

re people are planting veg- tural trends - an attempt to move
gardens and applying for forward, to change and be aware
n, lower-tier jobs in order of who we were and who we would

like tobe as a society.
We hope to embody the values
blue jeans and plaid signify by,
well, putting them on our bod-
ies. We look back to Americana to
find ourselves and our identities in
this current period; '50s America
is something of a role model - a
big sister we look up to as an ideal-
ized version of ourselves we have
yet to grow into, even if that view
is grounded more in unconditional
admiration than realism.
Fashion trends are more than
just an aesthetic statement; they
are a way for us to commune with
past cultures and future trends.
They are a way for us to reconsider
our values and reflect our changing
mentalities in the way we outward-
ly appear, manifesting our renewed
belief in America in our un-ironic
revisiting of blue jeans, cowboy
boots and plaid flannel.

"Consume Information, Gain Knowledge, Find Truth."
This is the philosophy of student-run street-wear line
STROKE. The mantra reflects style as a mode of confident
personal expression.
"To keep it simple in life, you have to be able to enter a
situation, whether familiar or unfamiliar, learn from that
experience, and in turn develop your own ideas to improve
yourself or your work," said Business sophomore Michael
Sulaka, co-founder of STROKE. "In regards to STROKE,
we try to form our own distinct identity and create our own
path to success."
This identity is heavily influenced by current popular
media and trends. Hip hop is the primary source of inspira-
tion, and the creative businesses of music and fashion have
never been more interwoven than
they are now. Kanye West's line of
Louis Vuitton shoes, for example,
is almost as highly publicized as
his album releases.
Though music personalities
are launching fashion labels more
quickly than remixes, Sulaka and
his partner, Art & Design sopho-
more Justin Finkelman, believe
they have tapped into a unique
market in the Midwest through
their line of culture-conscious
PE T-shirts.
Rather than imitating musi-
cians, the STROKE team pays
tribute to the music that inspires
themthrough clothes. Their shirts
sport bold block lyrics of rap icons
like Notorious B.I.G. and Jay-Z,
juxtaposed with funky and col-
orful graphic design. Sulaka and
Finkelman view hip hop as having
Ladies the power to transcend and blur
v *conventional labels.
"People are looking for some-
B Drafts thing different," Sulaka said. "Kids
is l4ght who used to wear Abercrombie
and Fitch are now wearing fitted
hats and graphic tees. We're all
h Platters trying to be unique. There's only
4.995100 so much that Polo can say - that's
! IaWt boring."
