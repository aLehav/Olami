Curriculum group to 
gather feedback from 
students, intergroup 
relations facilitators

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The LSA Curriculum Committee 

is planning to review the college’s 
Race and Ethnicity requirement 
during the next academic year. 
Currently, the Race and Ethnicity 
committee, a subcommittee of the 
Curriculum Committee, is working 
on a plan to consider a framework 
for reviewing the requirement.

Angela Dillard, the LSA associ-

ate dean for undergraduate edu-
cation, is spearheading the effort. 
According to Dillard, LSA Dean 
Andrew Martin has requested a 
plan to address the requirement no 
later than July 1.

The final proposal will need to 

gain the approval of the Curricu-
lum Committee, which approves 
any changes to the college’s under-
graduate curriculum, including 
concentration proposals, course 
listings and degree requirements.

LSA officials have been work-

ing on the requirement since last 
year. In October 2013, Public Pol-
icy senior Carly Manes, a former 
LSA representative in the Central 
Student 
Government 
assembly, 

met with University administra-
tors and discussed reforms to the 
requirement.

Dillard made it clear that the 

LSA Executive Committee is not 
currently considering structural 
changes to the requirement.

“Recommendations to alter the 

requirement in whole or in part is 
one possible outcome of the review,” 
she said. “But speculation of this 
possibility is a little premature.”

Dillard plans to consult with LSA 

Student Government, Intergroup 
Relations, learning analytics spe-
cialists and others in the college.

“One of the things that we hope 

to do in the review process is to 
make sense of student feedback 
and opinion about the require-
ment,” Dillard said. “It’s really 
hard because LSA has a lot of stu-
dents and you all don’t agree.”

She also stated she is keeping 

campus climate and student activ-
ism in mind while evaluating the 
requirement, citing Twitter cam-
paigns like #BBUM and #Black-
LivesMatter that have spurred 

ACADEMICS

Interim athletic 
director engages 
with students in 

fireside conversation 

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

As a University alumnus and 

former Michigan football play-
er, Interim Athletic Director 
Jim Hackett had been watching 
the events of the 2014 football 
season transpire from afar in 
Grand Rapids.

But then came a call from 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, asking him to take 
over the Athletic Department 
on an interim basis after Dave 
Brandon’s resignation on Oct. 
31. Hackett did not even know 
what Schlissel looked like until 
he arrived on campus for the 
announcement of his hiring. 
Suddenly, he was thrust into the 
role of Athletic Director.

He spent the early portion of 

his tenure evaluating the state 
of the football program, his 
department’s most crucial sport. 
Now, after firing former coach 
Brady Hoke on Dec. 2 and hiring 
Jim Harbaugh to replace him on 

Dec. 30, the status of the pro-
gram has settled down to a point 
where Hackett feels comfort-
able looking toward the future 
of Michigan athletics as a whole.

Wednesday evening, Hack-

ett met with about 20 students 
in the Hussey Room in the 
Michigan League for a fireside 
chat to discuss the most perti-
nent issues in Michigan athlet-
ics. The chat was the result of a 
combined effort by CSG Presi-
dent Bobby Dishell and the Ath-
letic Department.

Hackett engaged in dialogue 

with the students for an hour, 
looking relaxed and at ease. In 

his introduction, Hackett told 
the students that he “went from 
building seats to selling seats,” a 
reference to his former position 
as the Chief Executive Officer of 
Steelcase Furniture. By taking 
on his new role, Hackett put his 
retirement on hold.

Hackett held the fireside chat 

to engage the student body of 
Michigan to ensure that their 
experience with athletics is as 
fan-friendly as possible.

One such way to accomplish 

this goal was brought to his 
attention by the owner of the 
NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, Paul

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Make Michigan, 
The Team both 

found not guilty in 

UEC cases

By SAMI WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

After the final Central Stu-

dent 
Government 
election 

hearings Monday evening, the 
University Election Commis-
sion 
announced 
Wednesday 

morning that it had found both 
Make Michigan and The Team 
not guilty of harvesting e-mails.

While the hearing results 

signify that neither party will 
be disqualified, both parties 
have 24 hours to file an appeal 
to the Central Student Judi-
ciary. When the appeal process 
concludes, the UEC must then 
vote to certify the final results. 
If that process concludes with-
out appeal, Make Michigan will 
retain its hold on the presidency 

and vice presidency.

Since 
unofficial 
election 

results released last week that 
announced Make Michigan beat 
The Team by five votes, there 
have been a total of nine com-
plaints filed among both parties. 
The election was the closest CSG 
race in the last decade.

Law student Paige Becker, the 

University’s elections director, 
said the UEC found that neither 
Make Michigan nor The Team 
committed any of the pending 
election code violations the UEC 
had yet to rule on. As a result, the 
UEC assessed no demerits.

The CSG Compiled Code 

states that an election code vio-
lation may warrant a specified 
number of demerits, depending 
on the severity of the violation, 
to either a responsible individu-
al or an entire party.

An individual is disquali-

fied if he or she receives five 
demerits, and an entire party 
is disqualified if it receives 10 
demerits. The Team had previ-

Early Saturday morning, many 

students woke up to a 5 a.m. 
alarm they did not set. The alert 
was no accident; it was an Amber 
Alert for a missing 6-year-old girl.

The Michigan State Police 

issued the Amber Alert as part 
of an ongoing search for Hailey 
Betts, who was potentially in 
danger at the time. This was 
the first time the state police 
had used a system to deliver the 
alert through mobile phones. 
Though Michigan State Police 
Lt. David Kaiser told MLive 
he has heard some complaints 
about the early morning alert, 
he said it was crucial to spread

Difference honors 
100 individuals and 

organizations

By COLLEEN HARRISON

Daily Staff Reporter

Students, faculty and mem-

bers of the University commu-
nity gathered Wednesday night to 
honor students who were nomi-
nated for their leadership on cam-
pus.

Hosted by the Division of Stu-

dent Life, the Michigan Differ-
ence Student Leadership Awards 
recognized about 100 student 
leaders and student organiza-
tions, chosen from several hun-
dred nominations. Nearly 400 
people attended the fourth annual 
event.

Awards recognized students 

and groups in various categories, 
including art, philanthropy, ath-
letics and academics. For example, 
the Markley Hall Council won an 
award recognizing best teamwork 
by a student organization. The 
Detroit Partnership was noted as 
the group with the most impact 

on the campus community.

Steven Bodei, assistant direc-

tor of student development and 
experiential 
learning, 
helped 

coordinate the event, and noted it 
focuses on recognizing students 
in all arenas of campus life.

“The 
Michigan 
Difference 

Student Leadership Awards is to 
recognize students who are doing 
really amazing things, not neces-
sarily in the classroom,” he said.

Bodei said, as the event has 

evolved over the past few years, 
it’s become distinct from other 
award ceremonies because it 
focuses on more than just the 
awards, and aims to create a fun 
atmosphere.

“Five or six years ago they used 

to do an event that was similar to 
this and it was kind of your tra-
ditional everyone sits in an audi-
torium and people call people’s 
names,” Bodei said “It wasn’t very 
fun to be at, so unless you were 
winning there was basically no 
need to be there.”

Working with what Bodei 

described 
as 
“Oscar-esque 

style,” this year’s ceremony 
featured the two masters of 
ceremonies, LSA senior Simon 
Rivers 
and 
LSA 
sophomore 

Joshua Hobson, opening with a 

parody of “I Believe I Can Fly,” 
changed to “I Believe I Can 
Win.”

“There is a lot of effort that 

goes into this and I’m glad 
because we have so much tal-
ent within our university, and 
it’s something that (the Divi-
sion of Student Life doesn’t) take 
lightly. They’re really trying to 
recognize these individuals and 
give them an opportunity to 
shine and be in the spotlight,” 
Hobson said.

Those in attendance walked a 

blue carpet as they arrived, and 
a photographer snapped pho-
tos of attendees both individu-
ally and in groups. The Friars, a 
University a cappella group, also 
performed halfway through the 
ceremony.

“One of the things we’ve kind 

of transitioned from is that, 
although professional staff and 
student life help organize the 
event, it’s very driven by stu-
dents so all the awards are for 
students, most if not all of the 
presenters are students, per-
formers are students, it’s very 
student-driven, whereas in the 
past it was very staff driven,” 
Bodei said.

Acoustic Eidolon 
band plays to raise 
money for Micah 

Smiles fund at Mott 

By ALEX JUNTTI

For the Daily

Guests hurried into the audi-

torium at The Ark as the lights 
dimmed and the band Acoustic 
Eidolon took the stage during 
Wednesday night’s second annual 
Micah Smiles Benefit Concert.

The 
performance 
drew 

applause from the filled audito-
rium, but an even more notice-
able excitement radiated from the 
audience as the band and event 
organizers took time to talk about 
the event’s charitable mission: 
to continue to expand the music 
therapy program at C.S. Mott 
Children’s and Von Voigtlander 
Women’s Hospital.

The Micah Smiles Fund for 

Music Therapy was founded in 
December 2012 by Micah Can-
vasser’s mother, Jennifer Can-
vasser. Micah spent 10 months 
at Mott battling an intestinal 
disease before passing away at 11 
months old. Throughout Micah’s 
time at Mott, she and her family 
cherished the music therapy pro-
gram.

In Micah’s memory and in the 

support of the music therapy pro-
gram, The Micah Smiles Benefit 
concert is a way to gather pro-
ceeds in an effort to enrich as 
many lives as of pediatric patients 
as possible through the healing 
powers of music.

Canvasser said the concert 

aims to raise awareness for the 
public about the power of music 
therapy.

“This is a therapy that is very 

powerful and can really uplift 
the kids’ spirits and help connect 
families together, bring a smile to 

the child’s face and get their mind 
off the painful surgeries and com-
plications that they’re having,” 
she said.

Since its founding two years 

ago, the Micah Smiles Fund has 
raised $63,000 for music therapy 
at Mott and has seen the depart-
ment triple from one full-time 
music therapist to two full-time 
employees and a new music ther-
apy fellow.

Meredith Schlabig, Mott’s sec-

ond full-time music therapist, said 
she tries to get to know patients 
on a personal level to better reach 
them through music.

“The main overarching thing 

for me as a music therapist is to 
really hone in on who the patients 
are as individuals and bring who 
they are into the room through 
music 
when 
sometimes 
they 

may not feel like who they are,” 
Schlabig said.

Schlabig works with patients 

on singing, songwriting, creative 
self-expression, 
pain 
manage-

ment and positive coping skills. 
She also teaches instruments such 
as the ukulele, guitar and piano.

“My philosophy is if I go into 

a patient’s room and the child 
hasn’t smiled, I haven’t done my 
job,” Schlabig said. “The amount 
of smiles and laughter and con-
versation and beautiful music I 
get to make with patients every 
day is very rewarding to me.”

Mia Litzenberg, an 11-year-old 

singer who was recently hospital-
ized for severe eczema, has wit-
nessed the benefits the program 
has to offer. She said the music 
therapists, particularly Schlabig, 
have always been extremely kind.

“They encourage you and they 

are always there for you,” Litzen-
berg said. “When I was getting my 
treatments, I was really depressed 
and sad, but when I met Meredith 
she was always helping me and she 
just brought me a smile.”

Liztenberg’s 
mother, 
Lisa, 

added that the music therapists 
completely changed her daugh-
ter’s attitude about her illness.

conversation around race.

The 
#BBUM 
campaign, 

which stands for Being Black 
at the University of Michigan, 
was launched by the Univer-
sity’s Black Student Union in 
2013 to share the experiences 
of Black students on campus. In 
a follow up to the Twitter cam-
paign, BSU lobbied the Univer-
sity to meet a list of demands, 
including implementing a Race 
and 
Ethnicity 
requirement 

within all the University’s 
schools and colleges.

“I would never advocate 

doing the review despite these 
tensions but because of them,” 
Dillard said. “If we’re smart 
we’ll think with these tensions 
and concerns and protests and 
demands, all of which reflect 
similar tensions in our nation-
al and global history and in 
contemporary society.”

Dillard said Martin has held 

formal and informal conversa-
tions with students about the 
subject since January. Dillard 
plans to launch a public histo-
ry project on the requirement 
with the Bentley Historical 

Library. The project would be 
open to the community, and 
involve undergraduates in the 
archival research.

She would also like to work 

with the LSA SG on a series of 
open forums and discussions 
based on their expressed inter-
est in ensuring the inclusion of 
student voices and opinions.

Every year, one LSA SG 

executive sits on the Curricu-
lum Committee.

LSA 
sophomore 
Rachel 

Liang is this semester’s LSA 
SG representative on the com-
mittee. Liang and LSA senior 
Rachel Rickles, last semes-
ter’s 
representative, 
have 

been the primary students 
involved with committee’s 
work on the requirement.

LSA senior Natasha Dab-

rowski, outgoing president of 
LSA SG, said the governing 
body is an integral part of the 
review process.

“LSA SG is currently play-

ing a role in making sure that 
we can communicate with 
students on what the evalu-
ation process and what the 
requirement will look like,” 
she said.

Last semester, Dabrowski 

and LSA senior Corey Walsh, 

LSA SG vice president, includ-
ed a question at the end of the 
fall election ballot to gauge 
student opinions regarding 
the requirement.

The ballot question asked 

LSA students if current cours-
es that satisfy the require-
ment should either remain 
unchanged, be redefined to 
include course options that 
discuss multiple social identi-
ties or include course options 
that primarily focus on any 
individual social identity.

With 478 votes, most vot-

ers wanted the requirement 
to be redefined to include 
course options that discuss 
multiple 
social 
identities. 

Additionally, 275 students 
voted the requirement should 
remain as it is now, and 168 
voters wanted it to include 
course options that primar-
ily focus on any individual 
social identity.

“A 
lot 
of 
students 

were 
talking 
about 
(the 

requirement) 
and 
we 

wanted to capture it a little,” 
Dabrowski said. “Now, the 
evaluation will be able to 
really capture student and 
faculty sentiment in a more 
concrete way.”

ously been assessed four demer-
its for the destruction of Make 
Michigan campaign materials.

Two 
candidates, 
one 

from The Team and one 
from Make Michigan, have 
already been disqualified for 
e-mailing listservs that did 
not belong to them.

The Team filed a complaint 

accusing 
Make 
Michigan’s 

campaign 
manager, 
LSA 

freshman Lauren Siegel, of 
harvesting 5,719 e-mails by 
gathering uniqnames from 
the “Crush the Calendar” 
UPetition, which she cre-
ated. Had the UEC found the 
party responsible, it could 
have been assessed as many as 
17,000 demerits.

Make Michigan had alleged 

that The Team’s Representative 
Manager, LSA senior Andrew 
Loeb, had harvested 534 e-mails, 
which could have earned The 
Team over 1,000 demerits.

If Make Michigan had been 

disqualified for the e-mails 
violation, but The Team was 
found not responsible, The 
Team could have secured the 
executive seats. If both par-
ties had been found respon-
sible and were disqualified, 

the 
Defend 
Affirmative 

Action candidates would have 
assumed the presidency and 
vice presidency.

In its opinion for these 

cases, the UEC defined “har-
vesting” for the purposes of 
the code.

“(An e-mail) must have 

been removed from its origi-
nal context without any form 
of 
mutual 
understanding 

between the harvester and 
the owner of the address,” the 
UEC wrote in the decision.

According 
to 
the 
UEC, 

harvesting has not occurred 
when a student voluntarily 
provides his or her e-mail 
address for a given purpose, 
such as to receive messages 
from a party concerning the 
election. However, if a party or 
candidate recompiled e-mail 
addresses that were provided 
for one given purpose to use 
for a different purpose, that 
would constitute an election 
code violation.

The UEC further defined 

what could constitute e-mail 
harvesting as according to the 
Election Code.

“If 
candidate 
A 
goes 

through a listserv in order to 
find the e-mail addresses of a 
subset of that listserv — such as 
his friends — who he/she rea-
sonably could believe would be 

more likely than the average 
student to support his cam-
paign, he has not ‘harvested’ 
e-mail addresses within the 
meaning of the Code,” the UEC 
wrote in the decision.

In the case where a party 

or candidate copies all, most 
or even a random sample of 
the e-mails from a listserv 
whose purpose provides no 
reason to believe that those 
on the listserv would be more 
likely to support the party 
or candidate’s message than 
any other person, that party 
or candidate has acted in 
violation of the code.

In the decision, the UEC 

first held that because Loeb 
is neither a candidate nor a 
party, it does not have juris-
diction to determine his guilt 
or innocence. Thus, the UEC 
could not assess him or The 
Team any demerits for his 
actions.

In the case of Siegel’s 

actions, the UEC ultimately 
concluded in its decision 
that it cannot hold Siegel 
accountable for a campaign 
violation because it is possible 
that she may have reasonably 
believed that the students to 
whom she sent promotional 
e-mails would be more likely 
than any other student to 
support Make Michigan.

the information quickly.

“If it was their 6-year-old girl, 

they’d want us to do everything 
in our powers to make sure their 
girl was safe,” Kaiser said. “Time 
is of the essence in something 
like this.”

The alert included the model 

and license plate number of a 
truck the police suspected the girl 
might be in. The alert was sent 
to all cell phones in a 200-mile 
radius of Flint, where the girl was 
reported missing. Thousands of 
people were notified of the details 
of Betts’ case.

Betts was located at about 11 

a.m. Saturday and the alert was 
subsequently canceled. Betts was 
found unharmed at an apartment 
complex in Port Huron with her 
father, according to MLive.

Sergeant Sarah Krebs, who 

works in the state police’s Missing 
Persons Coordination Unit, said 
the Amber Alert played a key role 
in locating the girl. She went on 
to specify a few of the many ways 
Amber Alerts can be sent out.

“They can be done by regions, 

or you can do a radius of so many 
miles from the epicenter of where 
the child was missing, which 
is what they did in this case,” 
Krebs said. “You can also alert it 
statewide, meaning everywhere 
in the state of Michigan will get 
the alert.”

Though Amber Alerts intend 

to inform people of missing chil-
dren, Krebs said not all miss-
ing children fit the criteria the 
state police follows for issuing 
an Amber Alert. The police must 
determine the child — which 
they define as below 17 years of 
age — is at risk for serious bodily 
harm or death. Police must also 
believe an immediate broadcast 
through an Amber Alert would 
decrease the chances of harm to 
the child.

Other factors in determining 

the necessity of an Amber Alert 
include if the child suffers from 
mental or physical disabilities 
that impair his or her ability to 
care for himself or herself.

It was believed that Betts’ 

father 
had 
kidnapped 
her. 

Though he is her parent, Krebs 
said he could still be seen as a 
kidnapper in certain circum-
stances.

“The parent has to have put 

them in some great bodily harm 
and risk of death,” Krebs said.

Amber Alerts are only one of 

several ways authorities employ 
the Wireless Emergency Alert 
system. Other alerts include 
extreme 
weather 
and 
other 

threatening emergencies. Even 
presidential alerts can be sent 
out during a national emergency. 
The alerts appear like a text mes-
sage, except with a unique tone 
and vibration. Amber Alerts and 
weather alerts can be turned off 
on some phones, but presidential 
messages cannot.

The University also has its 

own methods to alert students 
of possible danger. The Division 
of Public Safety and Security 

sends out the types of alerts that 
inform students of potential dan-
ger.

The first way the University 

warns students is through its 
Emergency Alert System which 
is a mass, urgent notification 
system that can notify students, 
faculty and staff of any major 
campus 
emergency. 
These 

emergencies could include, but 
are not limited to, when an active 
shooter is at large, when there 
is a tornado warning for the 
county or when there is a large, 
hazardous spill on campus.

The second type of alert is a 

Crime Alert. A Crime Alert is 
sent out by DPSS when a crime 
has been reported to the law 
enforcement and DPSS believes 
it is important to warn the 
University community.

DPSS 
spokesperson 
Diane 

Brown said the Emergency Alert 
System is used when students 
need to take action, whereas the 
Crime Alerts are meant merely 
to inform students.

“The Emergency Alerts are 

used when there’s something 
that people need to do,” Brown 
said. “We don’t put Crime Alerts 
out on the emergency system, 
because 
the 
whole 
campus 

doesn’t necessarily have to take 
shelter or be aware or anything. 
They need to be aware of it, they 
need to know that there was still 
a threat. It doesn’t mean that 
everybody has to suddenly lock 
down and evacuate.”

Follow-up 
notifications 
are 

sent out at the discretion of DPSS. 
The Emergency Alert System may 
be used to update students when 
it is safe to continue with their 
day or when severe weather has 
passed, for example.

The two alerts are implement-

ed as part of the Clery Act, which 
requires universities and colleges 
participating in federal financial 
aid programs to disclose informa-
tion about crimes that may affect 
students in any way.

“We have a legal obligation 

to tell people, which is why it’s 
different than the police in your 
hometown,” Brown said. “They 
don’t have a legal requirement 
to tell people about crimes, but 
we do. The crime alerts and the 
emergency alerts are part of that 
requirement.”

Students may elect to receive 

Emergency Alert texts if they 
register their phone number on 
Wolverine Access. All students, 
faculty and staff also receive 
an e-mail with details of the 
emergency. Individuals can also 
check the University’s website 
and Twitter feed.

Though the alert is spread 

through many different mediums, 
Brown believes the best option for 
students is to sign up to receive 
texts and phone calls. She said she 
believes the number of students 
who do so is not high enough.

“We’ve never gotten over 

40-percent penetration of people 
signing up for the text messages 
and phone calls,” Brown said. 
“We would strongly recommend 
that people register, because 
we rarely use them, but they are 
important.”

Allen, perhaps as a thank-you for 
hiring Harbaugh away from his 
team’s most hated rival. Though 
the conversation started off with a 
discussion about Harbaugh, Allen’s 
“nemesis” when he was the coach 
of the San Francisco 49ers, it soon 
soon shifted to ticket policy. Allen 
suggested the idea of e-tickets, tell-
ing Hackett that fans enjoy being 
able to access their tickets on their 
phones.

Though Hackett said he does not 

yet have anything to show for the 
improvement of fan experience at 
Michigan athletic events, he hoped 
the fireside chat would help him in 
his research-gathering phase.

The first question was asked by 

John Lin, a third-year Law stu-
dent and CSG’s general counsel. 
He wanted to know Hackett’s feel-
ings on Adidas’ alternate uniforms, 
a topic that has seemed to divide 
fans in recent years. Hackett treat-
ed the question as a two-part issue, 
the first of which addressed the 
school’s use of Adidas as a whole.

“In my first months here, the 

question of which brand we wear 
is a big one,” Hackett said during 
the fireside chat. “We’ve organized 
— this is a secret — a project team 
to look at the question of, there’s 
really three players: Adidas, Under 
Armour and Nike.”

Hackett said the process of 

evaluating which brand of apparel 
Michigan’s teams will wear going 
forward is still in its early stages. 
The Athletic Department has sent 
out questionnaires to student-ath-
letes, and Hackett has spent time 
calling athletic directors at other 
schools to gauge their thoughts, 
in addition to speaking with for-
mer Michigan football players now 
playing in the NFL. After the com-
pletion of the fireside chat, Hackett 
told the Daily that if Michigan aims 
to switch from Adidas, it will have 
to do so by the end of the year.

In terms of alternate uniforms 

for individual games, Hackett 
noted that Harbaugh will have a 
strong influence on what the foot-
ball team wears.

“All the shoes are going to be 

black, he’s making it more conser-
vative, Harbaugh-esque,” Hackett 
quipped, accompanied by a laugh 
from the crowd at his new adjec-
tive. “We’re letting him go. Hey, 
you’re the coach, and he has rea-
sons for this.”

Soon after invoking Harbaugh’s 

name, Hackett took the opportuni-
ty to make sure the students were 
satisfied with his highest-profile 
hire. It proved unnecessary.

“Are you happy with him as a 

coach?” Hackett asked.

Hackett burst into laughter, and 

so did the rest of the room. Hackett 
remembers Harbaugh when he was 
a small child, when Hackett played 
for Michigan and Harbaugh was 
known as “Jimmy.”

Though 
Hackett 
admitted 

excitement about the upcoming 
Harbaugh era, he encouraged 
the students to keep things in 
perspective.

“We’ve got to keep our expecta-

tions (reasonable),” Hackett said, 
creating an imaginary ceiling with 
his hands. “They just have to get 
the team right. From the stuff I’ve 
seen, I’m really excited.”

The topic of conversation soon 

shifted to the student experi-
ence at Michigan Stadium and 
the tendency of many students 
to leave games well before they 
end. Hackett believes the issue 
will most easily be resolved by 
the improvement of the on-field 
product.

“I don’t want to sound sarcas-

tic,” Hackett said. “What I don’t 
want is more entertainment that’s 
not football. I think that works 
in the pros, but we’re in college. 
I believe college shouldn’t be like 
the pros. It shouldn’t cost like the 
pros.”

Hackett specifically noted that 

he didn’t want the games to feel 
“corporate,” a complaint that was 
commonly voiced by Michigan 
fans during Brandon’s tenure.

David Hershey, an Engineer-

ing senior, stated his displeasure 
with the piped-in music at Michi-
gan Stadium, greatly preferring 
the band. Once again, Hackett 
deferred to Harbaugh.

On Harbaugh’s first day in 

Michigan, right before his intro-
ductory press conference, Hackett 
went with Harbaugh to the suites 
in Michigan Stadium for a confer-
ence call. The pair looked out to the 
field, and Hackett asked the new 
coach what he thought of piped-in 
music during warmups. Harbaugh 
was firm in his answer.

“I don’t care. We don’t need it,” 

Harbaugh said.

Prof. Edward Goldman as well 
as to Sandra Gregerman, the 
director of the Undergraduate 
Research Opportunity Program. 
The award acknowledges indi-
viduals at the University who pro-
mote equity and social change.

Martin began her address by 

recounting historical advance-
ments, including lowering the 
voting age, the election of the 
first Black mayor in Detroit and 
the invention of in vitro fertil-
ization. She used these exam-
ples to demonstrate the impact 
individuals have had and still 
do have on the environments 
they inhabit.

“The world was changing 

even then as it is now,” she said.

Martin also spoke about 

her experiences reporting for 
the Washington Post, the Wall 
Street Journal and Nightline, 

as well as hosting the NPR 
show, “Tell Me More,” which 
was one of the few public radio 
programs designed to primar-
ily appeal to audiences of color. 
When the show was canceled as 
a result of budget cuts in 2014, 
many media critics saw the 
decision as a loss for coverage of 
diversity. Martin remains with 
NPR as a special correspondent 
focused on race, identity and 
gender, among other issues.

In her lecture, wielded her 

journalistic 
experience 
to 

discuss the current state of 
news media.

“We as a country and we 

very much in the media are still 
figuring out who has a voice 
and who does not,” Martin said.

She also spent time promot-

ing the importance of listening 
to all voices and not silencing 
minority opinions. To under-
stand the full truth in a story, 
Martin said all different per-
spectives and narratives must 

be heard.

“Listen to voices that make us 

uncomfortable because they are 
not going away,” Martin said.

She also discussed the ways 

she thinks news media should 
change to better reflect the 
nation’s 
population. 
Martin 

said heterosexual white men 
are more represented in media 
even though they are not the 
majority of the population and 
urged attendees to work toward 
changing media.

“I hold all of us responsible 

for failing to demand a dis-
course … with the kind of real-
ism about the world that we 
know exists,” she said.

Martin concluded her lec-

ture with tips on how to start 
conversations on difficult sub-
jects. She emphasized listen-
ing to others as well as asking 
thoughtful questions. Martin 
encouraged attendees to recog-
nize that they are engaging in 
difficult work.

Liztenberg’s mother, Lisa, 

added that the music therapists 
completely changed her daugh-
ter’s attitude about her illness.

“When Meredith appeared 

with her guitar and keyboard, 
Mia forgot all of her problems,” 
she said. “She was a different 
person … it really got her mind 
off of the difficult times and 
treatments at the hospital.”

At the end of their first set, 

Acoustic Eidolon stepped aside 
and welcomed Mia to the stage 
to perform a cover of Sara 
Bareilles’ “Brave” with guitar 
accompaniment from Schlabig.

Acoustic Eidolon is com-

posed of a double neck guitar 
player and cellist husband-

wife combo. A cancer survi-
vor herself, Acoustic Eidolon 
cellist Hannah Alkire said she 
can relate to stories like Mia’s, 
and is a strong advocate for 
the power of music to heal and 
inspire.

“I remember saying, ‘If I get 

picked to survive cancer, I’m 
going back and I’m going to take 
our music into hospitals and 
help other people through their 
journeys,’” Alkire said. “Any-
thing that we can do to make a 
journey easier is worth it.”

LSA 
senior 
Amanda 

Schoonover, who volunteers 
with the music therapists, said 
the mission behind the benefit 
concert means a lot to her.

“It’s near and dear to my 

heart,” Schoonover said. “I 
volunteer at the hospital with 
the music therapists. It’s really 

cool and the artists are amaz-
ing.”

The Canvasser family and 

Mott hope to further expand 
the program every year by 
hiring more musical thera-
pists and providing further 
treatment for those who need 
it most.our mission to work 
with people in the commu-
nity, to keep the patients in 
their community who can 
be cared for in their commu-
nity.”

Lawrence said, overall, he’s 

preparing to head a center 
that’s already on solid footing.

“It’s a very strong center 

with a lot of resources to start 
with, but I think there are 
things that we can build on 
that can make it a great cen-
ter, and that’s my goal,” he 
said.

I

’ll be candid. I’m sure that 
you’re not incredibly interested 
in a mildly dense recounting of 

Europe’s current 
economic 
state. 

But I promise that 
it’s intriguing and 
worth 
knowing 

about, and I have 
a point to make 
about it. Plus, if it 
somehow 
comes 

up in conversa-
tion, you’ll sound 
like a genius. Oh, 
and 
you’ll 
get 

to learn the fun 
word “grexit” — a combination of 
the words Greek and exit. I like to 
imagine it with a hashtag in front of 
it. #Grexit.

I knew that #Grexit would win 

you over.

Many European countries are part 

of the Eurozone — a group of coun-
tries that all use the euro as a form 
of currency. In many circumstances, 
this unified currency has a variety of 
advantages, but currently Greece’s 
economy is on the verge of bank-
ruptcy. Since Greece is part of the 
eurozone, this could spell disaster for 
a variety of countries. It could even 
impact the United States.

The trouble began years ago, 

when Greece began spending far 
more than it could afford. Both 
the government and individuals 
continually overspent, and while 
this would appear to be a problem 
that other countries would quickly 
realize, Greece was able to provide 
fraudulent information to mask 
 its deficits.

They could have continued hid-

ing this information if it weren’t for a 
financial crisis.

From 2007 to 2009 a financial 

crisis sent ripples throughout the 
national economy. The downturn 
unintentionally 
spotlighted 
the 

country’s immense debts and defi-
cits that defied Eurozone regula-
tions. This quickly led to panic at 
the fear of Greece going bankrupt, 
causing harm to both the country 
and other European countries.

The downturn created a need for 

bailout money, which would attempt 
to protect Greece from bankruptcy. 
Eurozone countries approved 110 
and 130 billion euros worth of rescue 
money in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

While this seems like a bless-

ing, Greece has received this money 
with reservations, much to the 
 

country’s dismay.

The bailout money came with 

strict regulations on the country’s 
spending habits. Spending cuts on 
defense, education, public sector 
wages, social security and civil ser-
vant jobs being decreased as people 
retire were some of the major sanc-
tions. This coincided with an incred-
ibly high 28 percent unemployment 
rate to create an agonizing climate 
for Greek citizens.

These living conditions created 

unrest within the country, and in 
late 2014, when Greek parliament 
failed to elect a prime minister, these 
issues surfaced. This spurred a new 
election in 2015 in which a member 
of Greece’s anti-
austerity 
party 

was elected into 
office. This man, 
Alexis 
Tsip-

ras, 
demanded 

changes to alle-
viate 
some 
of 

the 
regulations 

hurting 
Greek 

citizens.

Though Tsip-

ras 
promised 

large changes, and he did negotiate 
a four-month extension to Greece’s 
bailout, his election has caused 
incredible controversy within the 
Eurozone.

Greece is required to comply 

with a list of reforms to receive 
more bailout money, but given its 
current stance, there’s a large pos-
sibility that this won’t happen. 
Without this money, Greece may be 
unable to make its next repayment 
of 460 million euros on April 9, 
causing the country to go bankrupt.

This bankruptcy could cause 

Greece to exit the Eurozone, an 
action which has come to be known 

as a Grexit, and instead use its own 
currency instead of the euro. This 
could lead to large impacts, not only 
for Greece, but also for the rest of the 
Eurozone. If Greece tosses the euro, 
investors may recognize the possibil-
ity for other countries in poor eco-
nomic condition to exit the eurozone. 
This could cause the bankruptcy of 
Portugal, Italy and Spain. Multiple 
countries leaving the eurozone could 
send a wide ripple throughout the 
economy, potentially even affect-
ing the United States by decreasing 
employment and exports.

Now, why does all this matter to 

you? It’s because of the last sentence 
I wrote: that this economic crisis 
on the other side of the world has a 
power to impact America’s economy 
and your job. Every day that you lay 
your head on your pillow is another 
day closer to April 9, when Greece’s 
economy could land in total failure, 
and it has the power to impact you.

I don’t like telling people to 

know things for the sake of know-

ing things. It’s 
not my place to 
spew economic 
information 
at 

you because I 
think it’s inter-
esting. However, 
it is important 
that you have a 
working knowl-
edge about how 
larger 
issues 

could affect you. 

It keeps you prepared for a large cri-
sis and it allows you to have a voice 
in the conversation. Do you think 
Greece is demanding too much? Do 
you think the Eurozone is fair with 
their punishments? Regardless of 
your answer, if the entire inter-
national population held a mostly 
unified stance, I believe it’d be pos-
sible to effect an outcome that could 
deeply impact you.

And if that’s not enough, at least 

you learned the context for the 
 

word #Grexit.

When I was three, momma told me to believe
She said if I prayed I would get what I wanted
So I asked for Mrs. K to give me a gold star 

that week

For my good behavior, and for Beanie Babies 

and a new

episode of Barney

When I was five, dad told me that if I was 

good

I would be rewarded. If I served others and 

wasn’t mean

then I would get something even better.
“Better than gold stars and new toys?” I 

asked.

When I was seven, I went to Sikh camp
They taught me about being selfless and kind
How the company I kept was just as impor-

tant

As who I was
And what I did
So I listened and learned and went home 

with new pen pals

When I was ten, middle school started
Suddenly, I knew I was different
My hair black, the rest blonde
My eyes brown, the rest blue
My skin tan, the rest white
I knew I hadn’t changed, but their minds 

had

Suddenly, they saw me differently
And because it was Them, it meant I had 

become different

When I was thirteen, we moved
I remember driving down Fieldstone Court
for the last time, not wanting to turn around
and lose sight of that house forever
I remember seeing my dad cry for the first 

time

He asked my mom for a Kleenex and wiped 

away

the fear that rolled down all our faces
in the form of clear, wet, broken hopes

When I was fourteen, I was new again
I walked into the labyrinth of my new education
Afraid and alone

Knowing that I had to hide
Myself
So far from fourteen to eighteen
My faith became internal, and I
a turtle, hiding in her shell
Sikhi was for Sundays and home
And my whitewashed, convenient identity
created for the ease of those around me
was my mask

But, slowly, I forgot the mask was a mask
and my true self stayed in the shell
because I forgot to ask it to come out

When I was eighteen, I came to Ann Arbor
Unaware of the transformations to come
I met other Sikhs and they reminded me of 

my inner self that I had hid away

Told me it was time to take off the mask
and let go of my fear

So I did, well, for some time
but then I was nineteen and They killed my 

family friends

And then I was twenty and They beat up and 

elderly man as he took his evening stroll

And then I was twenty-one and They told me 

I didn’t belong

I wonder how
if I prayed like momma asked
and was good like dad told me
and served like camp taught me
Why does this all happen
Why is there so much
Hate, leaving no more room for
faith, hope, God

So, now, where am I?
I am afraid
I do believe I might die for my faith
But I would be honored
And I know that, for the sake of us all, I have 

to believe

That change will come
Change will come

Change from the School of Social Work. The 
combination of my major and minor often 
creates perplexed faces on whoever is asking 
the question. The responses are typically along 
the lines of “engineering and social work — that 
doesn’t make sense.”

This is the constant ideological and 

pedagogical struggle that has dominated my 
undergraduate educational experience. At 
the end of my undergraduate career, I feel 
it’s important to emphasize the underlying 
connection between these two apparently 
polar 
opposite 
academic 
pursuits. 
The 

unifying concept inextricably linking science, 
engineering, technology and mathematics 
to social science, arts, humanities and social 
justice is the principle of understanding 
the world around us to make life better for 
humanity as whole.

At first it may be a challenge to see the 

relationship between this principle and STEM 
fields. However, a closer examination elucidates 
the connection. I believe that Albert Einstein said 
it best with, “All religions, arts and sciences are 
branches of the same tree. All these aspirations 
are directed toward ennobling man’s life, lifting 
it from the sphere of mere physical existence and 
leading the individual towards freedom.”

In my opinion, STEM is more than equations, 

mathematical models and data; I prefer the 
view that these are techniques to understand 
the world. This understanding of the world 
can eventually lead to developments that can 
change our society as a whole. I believe STEM 
fields can realign themselves with a holistic 
understanding of the world by engaging 
STEM students in meaningful reflection and 
education around the people and communities 
that their work will ultimately impact.

In my experience, cultural and social 

competence is a low priority in most STEM 
education programs. Now, I’m speaking on 
my own experience within the College of 
Engineering, however, there are applications and 
implications to the STEM community at large. 
In the College of Engineering in the Department 
of Biomedical Engineering, there has been, at 
times, a complete disregard shown for those 
whom our work is inherently supposed to benefit. 
Peers and professors have made comments that 
forsake the integrity of patients for the pursuit of 
ideal data. There are complaints that blame the 

poor and “Obamacare” for taking away funding 
from their niche research directed at helping the 
wealthy, and there’s a constant stream of micro 
aggressions against anyone who isn’t a rich, 
white, heterosexual, “American” man of ideal 
body size. The social acceptance of complaining 
about the intelligence of GSIs based solely on their 
accent is just one example of the lack of cultural 
competency in the engineering community.

Being able to effectively work with people who 

are different from you is a skill that’s essential to 
success in the modern world. It’s important to 
not only examine your own experience in the 
interaction but those of the person or community 
you’re working with. An impressive final product 
doesn’t mean a team was able to effectively work 
together. Teammates could be dismissing the 
ideas of others based upon preconceived notions. 
The product could be successful, but the potential 
of the product is reduced by the exclusion of 
teammates and their ideas. It’s important to teach 
cultural competency skills, such as balancing 
power dynamics, respecting and acknowledging 
differences and creating opportunities for many 
diverse voices to be heard.

A 2005 article in the Research Journal 

for Engineering Education by Chubin, May 
and Babco explains, “Given the relatively 
homogeneous composition of the engineering 
faculty, and the profession’s workforce more 
generally, it behooves engineering education 
to assist current and future practitioners in 
becoming culturally competent.”

Social and cultural competency should not 

be an afterthought. It should not be something 
that’s assumed to be trivial and not worth the 
time. Cultural competency isn’t a distraction 
from scientific work, but rather a realignment 
with its original intention. As the “Leaders 
and Best,” it’s our responsibility to provide 
our students with all the skills they need to be 
successful in their future careers.

The 
College 
of 
Engineering 
and 
all 

undergraduate STEM programs at the University 
should implement cultural competency into 
their curriculums. This should not be thought 
of as a burden brought about by a liberal agenda, 
but instead as a means of equipping our future 
world-leading scientists, engineers, professors, 
mathematicians and members of the community 
with a complete set of skills to make our world a 
better place to call hoMe.

JAKE HELLER | VIEWPOINT

When STEM lost its way

HARLEEN KAUR | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

If I could ensure one thing as 

a result of reading this article, it 
would be that you learn from my 
mistakes without enduring similar 
ones yourself. Yet this is not how life 
works. You must make mistakes, you 
must fail. The ironic fact is that any 
attempt to shield you from making 
mistakes will lead you to them fast-
er, and with greater gravity. Here at 
the University of Michigan, we rep-
resent top students from the across 
the world, “the leaders and the best,” 
and, for most of us, the idea of failure 
has been conditioned to be thought of 
as unacceptable. This idea can be so 
profoundly instilled that many of us 
have likely never experienced much 
failure in our lives; it was simply not 
an option. Sure we have all forgotten 
about a spelling test once or forgot-
ten our clothes for gym class and had 
to take the zero, but in few of these 
circumstances have we stood back 
afterward with new wisdom toward 
life. This was my case.

The son of a former army cap-

tain with a doctorate in Ceramic 
Engineering and a first-generation 
American mother raised by a single 
mom, my life was very structured. 
Boy Scout, Eagle Scout, two-sport 
varsity athlete and valedictorian; 
my pre-collegiate life was close 
to perfect. I never drank, smoked, 
went out at night or on weekends 
or got in trouble. Now this didn’t 
mean I was never curious; you can’t 
help but peek over the fence to the 
neighbor’s yard sooner or later. 
Going through high school, I was 
very aware of the separate life many 
of my friends were living. It wasn’t 
a question of popularity, but rather 
a question of “was I missing out?” 
The bottom line was that there 
was no way I could ever have tried 
these things due to the nature of my 

household, and also that I was OK 
with waiting. Sure, everyone wants 
to be cool in high school, but no TV 
show or movie about high school 
could compare with those of col-
lege. In my mind college equated to 
freedom, a chance to grow, a chance 
to not miss out. College was the fin-
ish line and the trophy.

College is not the finish line; if any-

thing, it’s the starting line following 
a long warm up. Yes, this sounds like 
common sense, but to a high schooler 
who has waited 18 years to get away, 
patience is nearly gone. More impor-
tantly, common sense isn’t common. 
Many may have it, but this doesn’t 
mean it gets used.

When I went to my college orien-

tation, I heard the drinking lecture 
from advisors, police and students. 
Bottom line: “don’t be stupid.” Well 
duh! Come on, you don’t have to be 
a rocket scientist to understand how 
to not get caught. I was the top of 
my class; I had never once been in 
trouble, it could never happen to me. 
More importantly, I was “different 
than everyone else.”

Unfortunately, it was this mind-

set that I wasn’t warned about, 
or if I was, I didn’t listen to it. I 
was untouchable because I had 
never made a mistake before. In 
this sense, even if I did listen to 
it, I’d never be able to appreci-
ate it because of hubris. The mis-
take is thinking that years of hard 
work or fortune in high school 
will carry through college. When 
you get to college, no one knows 
you were a straight-A student or 
community volunteer. Your past 
doesn’t define you, your actions 
 

now do.

The second mistake is thinking 

that just because you reached junior 
year without any mess-ups or an 

MIP, you truly are “special.” No, this 
is just how long it takes to get care-
less, to push the bounds a little fur-
ther. The problem? When you finally 
do mess up, and everyone does, you 
won’t know how to react. You have 
been so used to avoiding failure that 
you don’t know what to do.

That was my case. That’s how an 

Aerospace Engineer graduating early 
in three and a half years woke up in 
a holding cell with an mip, breaking 
and entering, attempted resisting 
arrest and obstructing charges. Not 
only could all of these events have 
been avoided entirely, but there is 
also no reason they should have been 
anything more than an MIP, as the 
officer told me himself. I honestly 
believe that it was my shock in that 
situation that escalated things into 
the mess that it is now. I could not 
accept being in trouble as reality to 
the point that I fought it.

The message I am sending is 

not that I wish I had drank in high 
school or participated in other mis-
chief. What I am saying is that we 
only learn from our mistakes, and 
we need to be open to making them. 
It’s important to test the waters, but 
don’t dive in headfirst because you 
think you’re untouchable. I serve 
as living proof that failure happens 
to the best of us. I failed because of 
my hubris, because I believed that 
I couldn’t get in trouble, because 
I thought I was smarter or better 
than everyone else. I failed because 
when I made a mistake, I did not 
learn from it; I panicked and tried to 
run from it. Reading this isn’t going 
to keep you from making mistakes. 
I only hope it makes you aware that 
even you will make them.

To celebrate this great 

Planet Earth we all inhabit, 
Central Student Govern-
ment and Michigan Dining 
are co-hosting an Earth Day 
extravaganza on Fri., April 
3, from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 
p.m.

Focusing on the ideas of 

sustainability and engage-
ment, the celebration will 
take place at two locations: 
the Diag and Palmer Com-
mons.

On the Diag

All environmental enthu-

siasts will be able to par-
ticipate in the events that 
will be taking place on the 
Diag. More than 20 groups 
will be hosting activities for 
students to participate in. 
Whether you enjoy games, 

moss graffiti, trivia or even 
taking part in a take-the-
tap-water taste test, there’s 
something for everyone.

Along with these events, 

Michigan Dining chefs 
will present cooking dem-
onstrations and pass out 
free samples of things like 
donuts, apples, and trinkets 
to visitors.

Of course, no environ-

mental celebration would 
be complete without some 
educational information. 
The Office of Campus 
Sustainability and vari-
ous environmental student 
organizations will share 
with students ways to “go 
green” at the University.

Public Policy senior 

Bobby Dishell, Central Stu-
dent Government president, 
said he is happy to see the 
University collaborating.

“It is great to see the 

University coming together 
to celebrate the great work 

that is being done by stu-
dents, faculty and adminis-
tration alike,” Dishell said. 
“I look forward to seeing 
the celebration and hope 
the festivities spark even 
more change surrounding 
sustainability.”

At Palmer Commons

After taking more than 

your fair share of free 
donuts, head over to Forum 
Hall in the Palmer Com-
mons for a free showing of 
documentary “Farmland” 
at 2:30 p.m. 

The film follows the live-

lihoods of 20-something 
farmers and ranchers who 
have a passion for farm-
ing as it is passed down 
through generations.

Keith Foster, a University 

Dining manager, said he 
thinks the screening of the 
film will be interesting and 
enlightening for students. 

He added that there will be 
a panel following the film, 
which will include several 
farmers that the University 
works with.

“I think it will show 

students the importance 
of bringing sustainability 
to our work and how 
we can make an impact 
collectively,” Foster said.

WNIT run ends for ‘M’

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

As the door closed on the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s season, the three seniors 
— forwards Cyesha Goree and 
Nicole 
Elmblad 
and guard 
Shannon 
Smith — all broke down into 
tears.

Not only was the Wolverines’ 

69-65 loss to UCLA in the WNIT 
semifinal their last game at 
Crisler Center, but their last game 
in a Michigan uniform.

The tears flowed from the trio, 

especially considering how close 
they came to winning the game.

“The emotions were running 

because we were so close,” 
Elmblad said.

After back-and-forth scoring 

for most of the second half, Bruin 
guard Nirra Fields sank a jumper 
to put UCLA up by two.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico called a timeout to set up 
a play, “Purple Three,” which 
would 
put 
freshman 
guard 

Katelynn Flaherty wide-open at 
the top of the arc with a chance to 
put the Wolverines (8-10 Big Ten, 
20-15 overall) up one with less 
than a minute in the game.

The play worked to perfection, 

as UCLA left Flaherty open at the 
top of the arc and she let the ball 
fly.

The 
ball 
hit 
iron 
before 

UCLA 
(8-10 
Pac-12, 
18-18 

overall) gobbled up the rebound, 
seemingly shutting the door on 
the Wolverines’ season.

Even then, there was a glimmer 

of hope less than 30 seconds later 
when Bruin forward Lajahna 
Drummer missed the front end of 
her one-and-one.

But UCLA came up with 

a crucial offensive rebound, 
and Michigan was forced to 
foul Bruins sharpshooter Kari 
Korver, the cousin of NBA player 

Kyle Korver.

Korver, 
who 
killed 
the 

Wolverines all game, shooting 
5-for-7 from beyond the arc 
and 7-for-9 overall, sank both 
free throws to give UCLA an 
insurmountable four-point lead 
with 21 seconds left in the game.

Much of Korver’s success was 

attributed to her lanky 5-foot-9 
frame, which gave her a height 
advantage 
over 
Michigan’s 

guards. Korver would finish 
with a game-high 19 points, 13 of 
which came in the first half.

“Early in the game, she killed 

us,” Barnes Arico said. “We knew 
she was a great shooter, and I 
don’t think we contested her shot 
enough.”

On the other side of the court, 

Michigan’s sharpshooting duo of 
Flaherty and sophomore guard 
Siera Thompson couldn’t get it 
going, shooting a combined 5-for-
25, as Thompson missed all 11 
shots she took.

But the seniors picked up the 

slack, as Smith led the team with 

20 points, Elmblad finished with 
16 points and seven rebounds 
and Goree totaled 11 points and 
10 rebounds for her 18th double-
double of the season, a fitting 
ending to their Michigan careers.

“Everyone needs to give a 

hand to these seniors,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They’ve taken us. 
This has been their journey. This 
past month, we’ve been on their 
shoulders. They’ve carried us.”

The first half saw much of the 

same back-and-forth action as 
the Bruins led the Wolverines by 
one at the break.

For the game, Michigan shot 38 

percent, a huge difference from 
the Bruins, who shot 52 percent.

As the Crisler Center lights 

turn off for the last time this 
season, the Michigan careers of 
Goree, Elmblad and Smith end.

And after the record-setting 

season the three put together, in 
which the Wolverines played in 
its first April contest in program 
history, they will be sorely 
missed.

DELANEY RYAN/Daily

Senior forward Cyesha Goree closed her career with another double-double.

Closer than ever before
T

he Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s season 
ended when the buzzer 

sounded. 
Senior for-
ward Nicole 
Elmblad 
bit into her 
jersey and 
rested her 
hands on 
her hips as 
she watched 
UCLA cel-
ebrate a 
WNIT championship berth, 
something she has never expe-
rienced. The senior’s decorated 
career was over, and all she 
could do was stare at the ground 
as her teammates lined up to 
congratulate the victors. Along 
with her teammates, she waved 
to the crowd for their support 
before hustling into the tunnel 
one last time.

After a 69-65 loss to 

the Bruins that ended the 
Wolverines’ season in the WNIT 
semifinals, they left behind 
a crowd that filled Crisler 
Center with more noise than 
ever before. More importantly, 
though, they left behind an 
empty space above the team’s 
bench — one that will have to 
wait a little longer to be filled by 
a banner.

During postgame interviews, 

Elmblad was red-eyed as she 
rested her hands on her cheeks. 
Emotionally overwhelmed by 
both the loss and the effort her 
team had put in until the end, 
she knew it was her last time 
donning the maize and blue.

But Elmblad and her team 

didn’t go out without a fight. 
Michigan refused to turn down 
the high-tempo game that led the 
Wolverines to a WNIT semifinal 
for the first time in five years. 
Even after a season filled with 
over-the-top victories coupled 
with heart-wrenching losses, 
the spirit was still alive and the 
confidence continued to grow.

A few weeks ago, it was no 

different when the reality sunk 
in that Michigan would miss 
another NCAA Tournament. 
Elmblad and fellow seniors 
Cyesha Goree and Shannon 
Smith got together for dinner 
before the WNIT and vowed 
that they would maintain the 
winning mentality, even if it 
wasn’t for the national title.

“We want to do something 

— make a name for ourselves,” 
Smith said. “I feel like we put it 
all out there.”

Michigan did put it all on the 

floor. The Wolverines could have 
packed it in after a blowout loss 
to Michigan State in the Big Ten 
Tournament, but they stuck with 
it and ended up being one of the 
final eight teams in the country 

still playing basketball.

And they were so close to 

being one of the final four.

They were so close when 

sophomore guard Danielle 
Williams hustled back on 
defense with UCLA guard on a 
breakaway, eventually planting 
her feet and drawing a charge.

They were so close with 52 

seconds left, when the team put 
the “Purple Three” play into 
motion, designed to get Flaherty 
open. It worked in getting 
Flaherty open at the top of the 
key, and she let loose a 3-pointer 
that could have given Michigan 
the lead.

Goree thought they were close 

in that moment. Eagerly waiting 
under the basket for the rebound, 
she remembered Flaherty 
sinking the exact same shot from 
the exact same spot months 
earlier against Ohio State, a shot 
that ultimately paved the way 
for a win. But this was different. 
Instead, Flaherty’s 3-pointer 
rimmed out before dropping 
into the hands of a Bruin. Goree 
thought that maybe Flaherty was 
“just too open.”

Michigan was so close 

each time 
sophomore 
guard Siera 
Thompson 
planted her 
foot and 
launched the 
ball, putting 
fans on the 
edge of their seats as they hoped 
she could finally make one. 
Instead, Thompson was held 
scoreless for the first time in 
her career. A California native, 
Thompson’s nerves got the best 
of her as she played against 
players she grew up with.

“She’s been having a hell of 

a career,” Barnes Arico said. 
“And then tonight, she’s playing 
against her best friends she grew 
up with. That killed her. … That 
one’s gonna bother (Thompson) 
for a long time.”

And it was so close when the 

Wolverines were down by three 
and UCLA missed the first of 
a 1-and-1 opportunity. But the 
Bruins grabbed the rebound, 
forcing Michigan to foul 
once more and make it a two-
possession game.

“We’ve had a lot of games that 

have went down to the wire like 
this, we’ve kinda been through 
this before,” Goree said. “We 
thought we had it and knew what 
to do at the end.”

When the day comes for a 

banner to fill the only gap left 
inside Crisler, Barnes Arico said 
she is going to give this year’s 
senior class the net that she cuts 
down. They not only allowed the 
team to get this far by embodying 
the grit and passion Barnes Arico 

wants to instill in every player, 
but also by setting the example 
that playing hard is mandatory, 
even if it’s the WNIT.

Because Michigan still wanted 

to rewrite history, and it will.

Elmblad, Goree and Smith 

represent Barnes Arico’s most 
successful experiment.

During Barnes Arico’s second 

year, Elmblad became a more 
efficient player, ultimately 
finding a new niche at the 
forward position and improving 
in nearly every statistical 
category. In her final two 
seasons, she was the unanimous 
choice for the team captain.

Smith was a latecomer, joining 

the squad in Barnes Arico’s 
second year, but still scored 920 
points during her two years at 
Michigan, eclipsing 1,000 career 
points. Barnes Arico took a 
5-foot-7 point guard and turned 
her into a versatile and speedy 
guard-turned-rebounder that 
was ruthless in transition.

Then there’s Goree, who tore 

her anterior cruciate ligament 
twice and played just 32 total 
minutes before Barnes Arico’s 
arrival, but ended her career 

as the only 
Michigan 
player to post 
back-to-back 
seasons with 
300-plus 
rebounds.

Even in 

their absence, 

Smith, Goree and Elmblad will 
leave around a legacy that will 
live with the program for years 
to come.

For the returners, 

Wednesday’s loss means one 
thing.

“It’s, ‘Hey, if I’m ever in this 

position again, I’m gonna make 
this play,’ ” Barnes Arico said. 
“I hope they come back super 
motivated that this is never 
going to happen to (them) 
again.”

No matter how close the 

Wolverines came to reaching the 
WNIT championship, getting 
this far has meant enough. 
Elmblad, Smith and Goree defied 
the odds even after they had 
switched coaches or switched 
schools.

They showed anything is 

attainable. And next year, when 
— not if — Michigan reaches 
the NCAA Tournament, the 
Wolverines will continue to inch 
even closer toward banner.

Wednesday night, the record 

book didn’t close. In fact, it has 
turned to a blank page, because 
Michigan is closer than ever 
before.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Wolverines keep rolling

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

Daily Sports Writer

Coming 
into 
Wednesday’s 

game against Central Michigan, 
the Michigan baseball team’s 
offense was 
simmering. 
Over 
the 

previous 
three games, the Wolverines had 
averaged more than seven runs 
per game. In Tuesday’s win over 
Toledo, Michigan blasted nine 
hits — two of them going over the 
wall.

The 
offensive 
production 

continued Wednesday, as the 
Wolverines welcomed in April 
with a 5-3 win over Central 
Michigan. On what felt like the 
first day of spring, Michigan (2-4 
Big Ten, 16-12 overall) won its 
fourth game in a row to cap a six-
game homestand.

After neither team recorded 

a hit in the first three innings, 
the Wolverines broke it open 
in the fourth inning. Senior 
outfielder Jackson Glines began 
the frame with a leadoff walk 
before the Chippewas (5-1 MAC, 
18-11 overall) brought in Braxton 
Markle in relief. But Michigan 
gave the new pitcher no time to 
get comfortable.

Sophomore outfielder Carmen 

Benedetti, the first batter Markle 
faced, knocked a first-pitch single 

and advanced to second on a 
sacrifice bunt by junior outfielder 
Cody Bruder. Finally, junior 
infielder Travis Maezes put the 
Wolverines on the board with 
a two-run single. Wednesday’s 
game was Maezes’ first time 
playing since March 13, when he 
suffered a strained oblique.

“It feels great to get back 

there,” 
Maezes 
said. 
“No 

problems, no pain, no setbacks. 
It’s a good feeling to be in the 
lineup.”

And the damage wasn’t done 

there. Freshman catcher Drew 
Lugbauer drove Maezes in with a 
single of his own, giving Michigan 
a 3-0 lead to end the inning.

The 
Wolverines 
continued 

to pour it on in the fifth inning, 
as 
junior 
infielder 
Jacob 

Cronenworth blasted a solo home 
run to open the frame. It was 
Cronenworth’s third home run in 
as many games.

In the seventh, Benedetti, 

one of the most feared hitters 
in Michigan’s vaunted lineup, 
drew an intentional walk as he 
came up to bat with a runner on 
third base. But even from the 
base paths, Benedetti did his due 
damage: He stole second base 
and forced a throw from Central 
Michigan catcher Tyler Huntey. 
The runner on third, freshman 
shortstop Jake Bivens, stole home 
to give the Wolverines a 5-0 lead.

“We knew we were up against 

a tough opponent,” Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich said. “And 
we knew we were going to have 
to call on a bunch of people, but 
we trust those guys and we can 
count on those guys.”

In the eighth inning, Benedetti 

came 
on 
in 
relief. 
Central 

Michigan had runners on first 
and second with nobody out. 
This time, the Chippewas did 
slice 
Michigan’s 
lead. 
After 

Benedetti forced his first batter 
to pop out and struck out the 
next, designated hitter Daniel 
Jipping drove in both runs with 
a two-out single. After eight, the 
Wolverines led 5-2.

Freshman 
pitcher 
Bryan 

Pall came in to close out the 
ninth inning. Central Michigan 
shortstop Zach McKinstry scored 
on infielder Cody Leichman’s RBI 
groundout, but no further damage 
was done. After chipping into the 
lead, the Chippewas ultimately 
could not break the dam.

Michigan went 5-1 on its first 

homestand of the season. After 
being swept by Nebraska last 
weekend, the Wolverines look to 
be hitting their stride.

“After Nebraska, our backs 

were up against the ropes,” 
Bakich said. “But we’re not going 
to back down. We’re going to 
keep throwing punches and keep 
fighting.”

Walk into Chela’s, a small 

Mexican eatery on South Maple 
Road just off West Liberty 
Street, and you’ll notice a fairly 
large, seemingly old, blown-up 
photograph tacked up onto one 
of the walls near the back. The 
photo is in black and white, and 
displays an overall-clad young 
child standing lazily in a dusty 
parking lot. There’s a small 
food stand behind him with the 
emboldened word “Taquería” 
pasted on its storefront. With-
out context, this picture is sim-
ple and mismatched against the 
colorful chairs and small pec-
cadilloes dispersed throughout 
the eating room.

But ask Adrian Iraola, the store’s 

owner, about the photo in the 
back. Ask about the little boy in 
the photo, and how long ago it was 
taken, and why it hangs so proudly 
from the store’s back wall.

Ann Arbor residents and 

University students swim in 
a sea of food varieties. From 
Main Street to Kerrytown to 
the perimeters of the suburbs, 
good food isn’t hard to find. It’s 
the glory of the college town 
atmosphere: a large population 
of 20-somethings interested in 
providing genuine support to a 
food culture for their university. 
We benefit, in reputation and 
recognition, for the culture and 
tradition that this excellence 
provides. 
Zingerman’s 

Delicatessen, Fleetwood Diner, 
Frita Batidos, Blimpy Burger; 
Ann Arbor’s best is a seemingly 
endless 
list 
that 
is 
slowly 

expanding to the outskirts of 
our campus, just a short drive 
away, to Chela’s.

Adrian Iraola, a former archi-

tectural engineer and project 
manager for the city of Ann 
Arbor, 
had 
been 
searching 

for an accurate recreation of 
authentic Mexican cuisine. His 

wife Lori Iraola, an Ann Arbor 
native, experienced his insatia-
ble plight. 

“When he moved here, he 

couldn’t find it,” Lori said. 
“He could find a lot of very 
tasty food, a lot of variation 
of Mexican food, but we were 
looking for more of the original 
street food.”

Their search was vehement 

and 
vast; 
Adrian 
chuckled 

even at the recollections he has 
amassed from his search. He 
referenced one attempt at a res-
taurant in Ypsilanti. 

“The 
dishes 
didn’t 
even 

resemble what they said they 
were selling! My wife and I came 
out and we got in our vehicle and 
we both reached for a piece of 
candy from the ashtray,” Iraola 
said. “We turned to each other 
and we asked, ‘Are you trying to 
get the taste out of your mouth, 
too?’ and we both said, ‘Yes!’ ”

The couple faced constant 

disappointment in their search 
for an authentic Mexican taste. 
Dreamily and constantly, they 
would discuss the possibility of 
opening a restaurant of their own, 
one where Adrian could provide 
“real tortillas and rich carnitas 
and homemade asada. None of 
this queso dip on the tacos. I was 
going to have onion and cilantro 
and a slice of lime, the way that it 
is supposed to be!”

But this dream was slow in 

coming to actual physical form. 
Its first foundations were first 
laid as far back as 27 years ago 
when Adrian signed himself up 
for small-business classes and 
courses in addition to his numer-
ous early architectural projects. 
Adrian and Lori allowed life’s 
milestones to fill the next few 
decades of the couple’s lives, 
complete with marriage, chil-
dren and career success, but the 
flame was never extinguished 
from the proverbial back burner 
on which the dream was placed. 
And Lori reiterates this, relay-
ing their late night quiet discus-
sions of the topic. 

“We didn’t imagine the level 

of popularity we had coming. 
We thought it would be a little 
‘Ma and Pa’ diner kind of place 
and we’d maybe have some reg-
ulars,” Lori said. “Lying in bed, 
we used to think, ‘What kind of 
numbers are we going to do?’ ”

The couple’s experiences with 

specious Mexican restaurants 
did continue to stockpile. This 
built-up disquietude, working 

in tandem with the ever-pow-
erful passage of time, pushed 
Adrian and Lori to inch closer 
and closer to their dream. Edg-
ing into his 60s, and following 
the completion of an especially 
large parking garage project, 
Lori finally motivated Adrian 
enough with the first moves of 
the Chela’s project. A former 
stay-at-home mom and suc-
cessful equestrian coach, Lori 
visited numerous auctions and 
started buying kitchen equip-
ment. Drawing up the business 
plans and designing kitchen and 
eating space floor plans, the side 
project and buried dream slowly 
started to build from its hypo-

thetical bedrock. 

Adrian and his wife Lori 

opened Chela’s doors in May 
2012 to critical success. They 
were, as Lori explains, unknow-
ing of the void they were about 
to fill for so many people. 

“Just in the first few days we 

opened we were running out 
of food,” Lori said. “We had 
to immediately hire new staff 
because everything just explod-
ed. And it’s still growing.”

Harnessing the powers of 

authenticity, passion, incred-
ible work ethic and simplic-
ity, Chela’s seeks to amaze each 
and every customer who strolls 
through the door. As natives of 
Mexico City, both Adrian and 
the store’s manager, Enrique 
Aquino, inherently understand 
what flavors do and do not 
belong in authentic Mexican 
street cuisine. Perhaps even 
more importantly, the three 
have worked to buttress their 
restaurant with the same prin-

ciples of proper Mexican street 
food: an appreciation of sim-
ple flavors and well-prepared, 
properly selected ingredients. 

Adrian, Lori and Enrique 

couldn’t repeat the importance 
of 
simplicity 
enough. 
The 

greatest 
aversion 
and 
the 

greatest 
success 
of 
this 

institution is held in Chela’s’ 
refusal to tarnish or distract 
from the naturally abundant 
and richness of flavors that 
has always existed in authentic 
Mexican cuisine. Adrian likened 
it to a musical symphony. 

“There are the classics, like 

in music, that you don’t tamper 
with,” Adrian said. “To improve 

them would be to destroy them. 
We feel that way about our foods 
here. We stick to the basics, and 
don’t tamper with them, but are 
always focusing on the little 
ways we can improve things.”

Take the restaurant’s vegeta-

ble tacos as an example. 

“In Mexico, it’s probably not a 

very popular item,” Lori, a veg-
etarian herself, said. “And there 
are a lot of vegetarian options 
here. We take what would be 
carne asada or barbacoa and 
replace them with potatoes 
and a sautéed vegetable mix.” 
They’re creating an innovative 
version of an unpopular option 
using simplicity, authenticity 
and a particular knowledge of 
what does and doesn’t belong in 
their foods.

The freshness of Chela’s’ pro-

duce and basic ingredients is 
another disciplined standard of 
their food service. Some of the 
produce is hand-selected, while 
the rest is specially ordered for 

daily deliveries from the mar-
kets that the team has deter-
mined are the best. Typically, 
Lori or another member of the 
Chela’s family ventures to local 
food markets daily to find and 
purchase the best vegetables 
and ingredients for the next 
day’s meals.

“As soon as the farmer’s 

market opens, we start to get 
our zucchini and other fresh 
vegetables,” Lori said. “And 
here’s one of the surprising 
things: People notice when I 
serve corn or lettuce that was 
cut that day. And so yes we are 
good at what we do, but people 
notice best when you don’t serve 
with any additives. You can 
taste the freshness.” 

Using her developed, touchy-

feely selection process and the 
use of high standard produce 
providers, like the avocado rip-
ening center at Ann Arbor’s 
Frog Holler Produce, Lori is 
generating the axiom in all of its 
food service.

 Embedded within the restau-

rant’s ethos, in tandem with the 
authenticity, simplicity and high 
standards of freshness, exists an 
incredible sense of work ethic. 
As Aquino describes, the pas-
sion for their product drives the 
incredible work ethic of each 
employee. 

“That is something that I 

would like people to know. It 
tastes good because it is good, and 
it’s healthy,” Aquino said. “But it’s 
also so much closer to my heart, 
and our true passion, seeing a 
taco that is being made right, or a 
salsa that is made right.”

Like Adrian and Enrique, 

who 
both 
emigrated 
from 

Mexico City to the United 
States, many of the employees 
of the restaurant are first or 
second-generation immigrants. 
In 
American 
culture 
today, 

the stigma of the Mexican 
immigrant can be incorrectly 
perceived. When asked about 
this all-too-common societal 
blemish and his experiences 
with it, Aquino spoke seriously 
and passionately. 

“These are people, myself 

included, who are motivated 
for more,” he said. “They have a 
passion for a better life, and are 
willing to work as hard as pos-
sible to reach their dreams. We 
have 
high-quality 
employees 

because Chela’s is surrounded 
by these ideas.”

To provide more context, 

Adrian provided an analogy: 
“Imagine the first-generation 
immigrants in any family. They 
had to work the hardest, taking 
any and all jobs as best they can 
so that they can give their ances-
tors a better life.” 

Both Lori and Adrian could 

describe 
working 
minimum 

wage jobs at exceedingly young 
ages; for Adrian, he was driv-
ing a car for his father’s parking 
lot business at the age of 11. Lori 
used money from her various 
jobs growing up to buy clothes 
for herself.

“It isn’t that there is a lack 

of motivation among third-, 
fourth- or fifth-generation fam-
ily members. It’s just that the 
circumstances 
are 
different,” 

Adrian said. “We’ve provided a 
great life for our children, and 
now they are learning how to 
build off of that.”

Before exiting Chela’s, upon 

finishing my interviews with 
Adrian, Lori and Enrique, and 
after being filled with delicious 
samples and treats, I looked back 
at the photograph hanging on 
the wall. It’s a picture of Adrian 
as a young boy, standing in a 
parking lot that his father built. 
Adrian’s father owned a parking 
lot business that placed taquería 
stands in each lot his company 
built. Light Mexican music plays 
from the speaker above as deli-
cious smells start to emerge from 
the nearby kitchen. It’s 11:00 in 
the morning and the custom-
ers have already started to pour 
in. Sipping on a sample of their 
homemade limeade — the only 
ingredient are limes, sugar and 
water, just like grandma made it 
— an involuntary smile is paint-
ed across my face. Gazing at the 
photo, and then back at Adrian’s 
kind eyes as he stands next to 
me, I now understand the magic 
of this photo. The creation and 
success of Chela’s isn’t illusory, 
nor is it a result of fate, coinci-
dence or highly strategic plan-
ning. This is authenticity.

LITERARY COLUMN

What’s your 
favorite book?

D

ear readers, my time 
with you is quickly 
drawing to a close. In 

a few short weeks I shall walk 
out of The Big House and into 
the 
swirling 
mists of 
uncer-
tainty 
known 
as the 
real 
world.

It 
is 

my duty, 
there-
fore, to use this, my penulti-
mate column, to settle a matter 
of some dispute. It’s a question 
that invariably comes up, from 
icebreakers in classes to small 
talk with strangers. The question 
I refer to is, of course, “What’s 
your favorite book?”

Readers, I must confess to you, 

this question terrifies me. I usual-
ly give some elusive non-answer 
about how it’s too hard to choose 
just one book. But that’s not quite 
the truth. In reality, I fear that 
fellow readers may judge my lit-
erary tastes as too pedestrian.

I can’t rattle off a list of up-

and-coming writers to check 
out, as I much prefer reading the 
time-tested “classics.” And even 
then, I’d rather watch “Hamlet” 
than “Titus Andronicus,” and I’d 
rather read “Pride and Prejudice” 
than “Mansfield Park.” (Seri-
ously, get outta here, Fanny.) If 
something as personalized and 
expressive as my literary tastes 
veer toward the commonplace, 
what does that say about me?

Well, instead of playing into 

this fear, I am confronting it head 
on. Because I’m a rebel at heart 

(just one that usually follows all 
the rules), instead of naming my 
10 favorite books, I shall instead 
name 10 writers who have great-
ly influenced my own literary 
world. Presented in chronologi-
cal order of when they appeared 
in my life, I am proud to claim all 
of these writers as mentors.

Edgar Allan Poe

I’ve mentioned Poe in several 

of my past articles, and he’s 
been an invaluable part of my 
literary life from the time I saw 
“The Raven” segment from “The 
Simpsons” ’s first “Treehouse of 
Horror” special. He had a hand 
in developing science fiction and 
mystery, and he forever changed 
the landscape of horror. Though 
many of the myths surrounding 
Poe stem from the lies of rival 
writer Rufus Griswold written 
after 
Poe’s 
death, 
there’s 

something 
oddly 
satisfying 

about being able to match the 
psyche of a writer to their work, 
and Poe and his work remain 
shrouded in mystery.

J.K. Rowling

There are people who will no 

doubt say I’m blinded by nos-
talgia in choosing Rowling for 
this list. To those people I say, 
“Come at me.” J.K. Rowling is 
nothing less than an outstand-
ing writer for both adults and 
children. Say what you will 
regarding style — in terms of 
structure and actual storytell-
ing, Rowling is a master. And in 
all her works, from “Harry Pot-
ter” to “The Casual Vacancy,” 
Rowling has the rare ability to 
make a reader truly care about 
a character.

Jane Austen

I love Jane Austen. People 

who dismiss her work as vapid 

chick-lit completely miss her 
unique and biting critique of 
class and upper-class mores — 
which is unrivaled to this day. 
Yes, you can expect a happy 
ending, but so what? I’m not 
of the school of thought that 
everything worth reading has 
to end in doom and gloom. Per-
haps most importantly, Austen 
led me to other great female 
authors like the Brontë Sisters, 
Elizabeth Gaskell and even 
Edith Wharton. And of course, 
her works provided hours of 
quality 
miniseries 
material, 

complete with attractive Brit-
ish men in cravats. Is there any 
greater legacy?

Wilfred Owen

I first discovered the poetry 

of Wilfred Owen in AP English 
when we read his poem “Dulce 
et Decorum Est.” Owen, a British 
solider who died in WWI, docu-
mented the horrors and atrocities 
he saw while in battle. He was the 
first time I recognized that poetry 
could be deeply political without 
sacrificing its linguistic beauty.

Nathaniel Hawthorne

I, like many, first read “The 

Scarlet Letter” in high school. 
To be honest, all I really got 
from that first reading was that 
Puritans were tools. My real 
interest in Hawthorne came on 

GRACE 
PROSNIEWSKI

the heels of visiting the actual 
House of the Seven Gables in 
Salem, Massachusetts and the 
house Hawthorne was born in. 
After this visit, I was better able 
to understand and appreciate the 
dark romanticism of Hawthorne’s 
work as well as his contribution 
to the mythologizing of Old New 
England. His collection of short 
stories, “Twice-Told Tales” and 
“Mosses from an Old Manse,” are 
required reading in my book.

Pablo Neruda

I first heard of Pablo Neruda 

as part of a joke on, you guessed 
it, “The Simpsons.” However, my 
first experience with his work 
came first semester of my fresh-
man year in my Spanish 232 
class. As part of our final exam, 
we had to conduct a conversa-
tion with the teacher on a topic 
of our choosing. I chose to talk 
about Neruda’s poem “Puedo 
escribir los versos más tristes 
esta noche,” or “Tonight I can 
write the saddest lines.” While 
my conversation never got much 
past variations of the phrase “es 
muy bueno, pero muy triste,” I 
did come to appreciate Neruda’s 
exquisitely haunting style.

H.P. Lovecraft

I’ve already written an in-depth 

analysis of my admiration for the 
undisputed king of weird fiction, 

H.P. Lovecraft. His tales of 
darkness and madness are beyond 
explanation or embellishment. 
“Ph’nglui 
mglw’nafh 
Cthulhu 

R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.”

E.E. Cummings

E.E. Cummings has a won-

derfully distinctive style and 
wit about his work, so much so 
that when you see one of his 
poems you know it’s his before 
anyone has to tell you. Immedi-
ately noticeable in his poems are 
the unique typography and play 
with grammar and punctuation. 
But as with all poetry, the emo-
tions behind the words are what 
truly set Cummings apart. His 
sweet descriptions of love and 
nature remind the reader of the 
best parts of this strange phe-
nomenon known as life.

bell hooks

Excuse me, my Women Stud-

ies degree is showing. I debat-
ed on whether or not I should 
include hooks on this list, as 
the other entries work primar-
ily in fiction while hooks writes 
in the realm of critical theory. 
However, hooks taught me one 
of the most important lessons 
regarding writing, specifically 
academic writing. Namely, if 
you alienate an entire portion 
of the population just to prove 
how smart you are by throw-

ing in jargon and obscure ref-
erences into your work, your 
writing’s not worth the paper 
it’s printed on. Needless to say, 
hooks’s “Theory as a Liberatory 
Practice” should be mandatory 
reading for all professors.

Warsan Shire

Warsan Shire is the most 

contemporary writer on this 
list. She’s only 26 and has one 
published 
poetry 
pamphlet, 

“Teaching my Mother How to 
Give Birth.” However, it’s quite 
possible you may have already 
heard one of her works, “for 
women who are ‘difficult’ to 
love,” which went viral in 2011. 
A Kenyan-born, Somali immi-
grant living in London, much of 
Shire’s work deals with themes 
of home, love and belonging, all 
weaved into a brutally beauti-
ful language that is both foreign 
and familiar.

While this is by no means a 

complete list, I believe this is a 
fairly illustrative snapshot of my 
literary life thus far. If you feel 
so inclined, why not take a walk 
down your own literary memory 
lane? You might be surprised 
what you discover.

FOOD COLUMN

Eating to a sense of 

where you are

A 

block away from my apart-
ment in Rome, next to the 
barber and the stop for the 

44 bus, is a small, red restaurant 
called Home Baked. When I first 
eyed it two 
months ago, 
I assumed 
it was just a 
normal café, 
the name due 
to the Italian 
love of English 
phrases like 
“Snack Bar” 
or “Happy 
Hour.” But 
Home Baked 
serves “American” food — you 
can get a latte there, or a bagel, or 
a bacon-egg-and-cheese. When 
my professors were introducing 
the neighborhood the first day 
of class, one of them mentioned 
Home Baked, and quietly advised 
us to “not let it become a crutch.”

I harrumphed at his warn-

ing, not because I thought it 
was wrong, but rather because I 
assumed it could never apply to 
me. I was in Rome, for Jupiter’s 
sake — why would I waste even one 
meal on American food? I couldn’t 
even fathom why Italians would go 
there, when they had cappuccinos 
and cornetti on every corner.

But then again, I often find 

myself becoming obsessively, even 
fanatically locavore here in Italy. 
Not in a slow-food, “These onions 
were grown a mile away away and 
the chicken’s name was Beyoncé,” 
kind of way. It’s more a heightened 
sense of regionalism, an acknowl-
edgement that Italy is, in a sense, 
made of many different countries.

For a long time, this was a lit-

eral truth. Italy was fragmented 
into various city-states. There was 
a Kingdom of Sicily. There was a 
Republic of Venice, whose power 
ebbed and flowed like its famous 
canals. Rome was, naturally, an 
independent territory ruled by 
the Pope. These mini-nations had 
their own governments, their own 
armies, their own culture, even 
their own loosely related languag-
es. What we think of as “Italian” 
today is really just the dialect of 
Medieval Florence, which Dante 
famously wrote in.

This system continued until 

the 1860s, when the various 
Kingdoms were pieced together 
(after many battles) to form one, 
Frankenstein-like nation. So vast 
were the cultural, economic and 
linguistic differences between the 
new citizens that one statesman, 
Massimo D’Azeglio, claimed “We 
have made Italy. Now we must 
make Italians.” And after decades 
of television, highways, education 
(and fascism), Italy has succeeded 
somewhat. But there remains an 
intense spirit of regional identity, 
with many people considering 
themselves Neapolitan or Roman 
or Sicilian before Italian.

With all of this in mind, I always 

make a point of sampling the deli-
cacy of any new city or region I 
travel to. In this food-obsessed and 
fragmented country, those two 
descriptors can be one in the same. 
And in the last month, I’ve made 
quite a journey.

I started out in early March, in 

Calabria, the toe of the boot-like 
Italian peninsula. In the small 
town of Paola, where my bus had 
stopped on a windy afternoon 
for lunch, I hunted for something 
— anything — to eat indigenous 
to the area. Ducking into a small 
salumeria with two friends, I cau-
tiously approached the counter 
and asked the grizzled proprietor 
if he had any ’nduja (ahn-doo-ya), 
the uniquely Calabrian cured pork 
spread made with red chilis. He 
broke out into a huge smile, and 
replied that he had a jar of his 
homemade version. A few euros 
later, and I received a plate with 
several slices of toast, thickly 
spread with dense, artery-red 
’nduja. The fat seeped through the 
bread and glistened on my finger-
tips, as I took less-than-delicate 
bites and felt my lips glow from 
those incredible peppers. It tasted 
like Calabria.

Two days later, I took a ferry 

from the lapis-lazuli waters of Cal-
abria, onto the periwinkle shores 
of Sicily. I could devote a bakers 
dozen columns to everything I saw 
and ate there, but my first meal felt 
the most emphatically Sicilian. In 
Taormina, a seaside town in the 
northeast corner of the island, at 
a restaurant named “La Grotta 

Azzura” tucked away in an alley, I 
waited a half-hour before the pasta 
arrived to the table on a silver plat-
ter. Our scruffy Adonis of a waiter 
tossed the linguine before doling 
out the portions. The long noodles 
were coated with a silken sauce of 
cherry tomatoes, flakes of sword-
fish, and caperberries the size of 
gumdrops. It was one of the most 
intense things I had ever tasted; 
those tomatoes, jiggled in a hot 
pan until they burst, were the most 
tomatoe-y tomatoes I’ve sampled. 
It tasted like Sicily.

My next stop: Ann Arbor. I flew 

back there after Sicily, and in the 
days leading up to it, all I could 
think of was the food there. Not 
with dread or disgust, but hungry 
anticipation, like a man about to 
be released from prison. And yet, 
I wasn’t craving American food, 
but rather the cuisines of Viet-
nam, China and Mexico. My entire 
frigid week there, I ate nothing but 
bibimbop, burritos and baozi. It 
tasted like America.

Italy and America are very 

different, 
gastronomically 

speaking. Not simply because 
disparity in ingredients or cook-
ing methods, but more a matter 
of focus. If I could narrow “Ital-
ian” food down to one ethos, it 
would be making things taste 
like themselves. An orange in 
Palermo tastes like a whole grove 
of oranges. A slice of prosciutto 
in Ravenna tastes like the pig 
was eating other pigs. I can only 
narrow down American food 
to an ethos of non-narrowness. 
Whatever it sacrifices in terms 
of intensity of flavor, it regains in 
diversity, for better or for worse.

Since I’ve come back to Rome, I 

always look at Home Baked a little 
differently, trying to imagine what 
an Italian might think of it. Maybe 
they really do think of it as a for-
eign invader, peddling fodder for 
flabby tourists. But maybe it’s an 
amusing little addition to the sta-
tus quo, an occasionally fun treat, 
never a member of the family, but a 
good neighbor, nonetheless.

Bringing the arts 
behind cell bars

PCAP helps 
find beauty in 

unexpected places 

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

When you picture prisoners 

making artwork, what do you 
imagine? Is it something dark, like 
a roughly etched skull inspired by 
some grisly tattoo? Or a bitterly 
quipped poem, dripping with edge 
and resentment?

In a correctional facility void of 

color and the vivacious hum of life, 
it’s difficult to believe that creativi-
ty can thrive — like plants, art must 
be tended to, pruned by its habi-
tat and nourished by its creator. 
Beautiful art comes from beauti-
ful situations, not necessarily in 
the literal sense, but abstractly: 
the artist seizes a desire, a motion, 
then encapsulates it. But first, he 
must have the knowledge to exe-
cute his art, from hours of school-
ing and practice. He must have 
the agency to learn, to rove and be 
inspired by his surroundings — all 
privileges that are unavailable to 
people who are incarcerated.

Though in spite of this, prison-

ers — perhaps more than anyone 
else — have a desire to create art, 
not only for self-expressive and 
rehabilitative purposes, but also 
because of a humanistic need to 
produce something of value.

What makes something valu-

able? We treasure Leonardo Da 
Vinci’s Mona Lisa because of its 
antiquity and haunting realness; 
we prize our mother’s jewelry col-
lection because of its sentimental-
ity and hushed worth. We value 
our friends, our essays, the college 
acceptance letters we ecstatically 
received. We latch onto land-
mark paintings in the Louvre and 
our own tiny trinkets of memory 
because of their uniqueness, for an 
object’s value comes from it being 
one of a kind.

Sometimes the sheer knowledge 

of one’s own value is the tipping 
point between a deadly fall down 
the wrong path and the drive to 
do something great in life. Ashley 
Lucas, director of the University’s 
Prisoner Creative Arts Project, 
found herself teetering on this 
point at age 15, when her father 
was summoned to a long prison 
sentence. In his absence, Lucas 
floundered in school and drifted 
toward a rough crowd, struggling 
to find a purpose each day.

“Theater saved her life,” said 

Phil Christman, Lucas’s husband 
and editor of the PCAP Literary 
Review of Creative Writing by 
Michigan Prisoners. “As a teen-
ager, Ashley took refuge on stage 
and threw herself into acting. 
She eventually performed a one-
woman play expressing the clash-
ing emotions she had been feeling, 
which drew University attention 
and earned her a scholarship to 
study drama.”

Realizing the power of art, 

not just as an outlet for creative 
expression but as the turning key 
to a meaningful, fulfilling life, 
Lucas was inspired to give the men 
and women incarcerated in Michi-

gan the same experience through 
PCAP. Initiated by University stu-
dents in 1990, the project has since 
expanded its outreach: hosting 
annual events, including the Exhi-
bition of Art by Michigan Prison-
ers; showcasing the best artwork 
and writing submitted by Michi-
gan prisoners, as well as a juvenile 
art show; directing the Portfolio 
Project, a one-on-one program 
that assists prisoners in preparing 
portfolios of their artwork to pres-
ent to judges and future employers, 
and the Linkage Project, which 
provides a creative community for 
adults returning from incarcera-
tion.

PCAP also organizes collabora-

tive workshops within correction-
al facilities and urban high schools 
for theater, creative writing, art, 
dance and music, driven mainly by 
small groups of University under-
graduates. Facilitating these work-
shops is a richly rewarding way to 
get involved as an undergraduate, 
not only because they give volun-
teers insight into the justice sys-
tem and allow them to tune their 
own artistry, but also because of 
the impact they make on those 
incarcerated.

At the book release and read-

ing of the Literary Review on 
Sunday, Barbera Montez, wife 
of Steven Montez, read the essay 
“Confluence” on the behalf of her 
husband, who wrote it. Before 
beginning, she addressed PCAP 
by saying, “Thank you for giving 
the voiceless a voice. Even more, 
thank you for listening to what 
they have to say.”

The Literary Review, published 

annually, is a compilation of the 
best creative writing submissions 
from prisoners, as voted on by a 
large group of readers in the Ann 
Arbor area. I was fortunate to be 
one of the readers for this year’s 
volume, working with Christman, 
assistant editor Denise Dooley, 
copy editor Ian Demsky and oth-
ers to determine which works to 
publish. Submission criteria are 
simple: anything goes, from poet-
ry to essays, as long as the con-
tent is not explicit enough to shut 
down PCAP.

“Really, 
criticisms 
of 
the 

Department 
of 
Corrections 

should be made,” Christman said, 
explaining what can and cannot 
be published. “But there’s a big dif-

ference between writing a memoir 
about how bad prison food is and 
saying that you want to harm a 
particular officer.”

The fact is, writers write from 

experience. It only makes sense 
that 
frustration, 
confinement, 

isolation and homesickness are 
recurring themes among submis-
sions. These themes come even 
more alive when reading the writ-
er’s personal statement — a note to 
the reader that often describes the 
circumstances that led to his or 
her prison sentence, told in heart-
breaking honesty.

For me, these notes made it dif-

ficult to reject submissions; I won-
dered what Christman thought.

“Deep down, you know that 

these are people who have been 
told ‘no’ their entire lives,” Christ-
man said. “But you have to look 
past this and read them critically 
like anything else. The crueler 
thing would be to accept every-
thing — it would devalue the writ-
er’s integrity.”

“One time a writer we published 

asked me, ‘Are you all just doing 
this to be nice?’ It broke my heart,” 
Christman continued. “He wanted 
so badly to be taken seriously that 
it was impossible for him to believe 
that we heard him, that he had 
made something beautiful.”

The man was Thomas Engle, 

a talented writer who has been 
featured in several volumes of 
the Literary Review. Having now 
returned 
from 
incarceration, 

Engle appeared on Sunday to read 
his own story, “Jim.” I was able to 
catch Engle on his way out of the 
Art & Architecture Auditorium, 
where the reading was held. I 
hoped that he could reveal how, 
despite being removed from much 
of life’s beauty, creative inspira-
tion still thrives within prisoners 
through PCAP.

“Their 
minds 
have 
been 

untapped — they have the focus 
and determination of those that 
have had no chance to express 
their talent,” Engle said. “The 
sad and lonely have a story to be 
heard.”

Though the sad and lonely may 

be imprisoned in body, they cannot 
be confined in mind. The mission 
of PCAP is to sift through the feel-
ings of hate, of hopelessness and 
hurting, to seek a light and pull it 
shining to the surface.

Rihanna said she wants 

her eighth album, currently 
referred to as R8, to be “time-
less.” 
Not 

long 
after, 

we 
get 

“Bitch Bet-
ter

My Money.” 
Will every-
one still be 
“turning up 
to Rihanna 
while 
the 

whole club 
fucking wasted” in 40 years? I 
mean, I probably will be, but I 
may be a poor judge of timeless-
ness.

Rihanna gave us her time-

less “FourFiveSeconds,” and I 
am happy to see Riri return to 
some of her signature thump-
ing in-you-face fighting lyrics. 
She knows she is hot; we know 
she’s hot; and she knows that we 
know that she’s hot.

The beats are surprising 

minimalist for producer Kanye 
West; without any deep bass 
drops, this song gets its flow 
from Rihanna’s lyrics and their 
delivery. Her flow is infec-
tious, especially in lines such as 
“Louis XIII and it’s all on me,” 
and “Shit, your wife in the back-
seat of my brand new foreign 

car.” At first listen, the song may 
sound as if it lacking a catch, but 
after a few more plays it will 
have listeners chanting along.

I don’t know if this bitch has 

Rihanna’s money, but I will 
gladly throw her my $1.29 to 
have this sure-to-be hit in my 
music library.

The evaluative index for scary 

movies is rarely their ability to 
be re-watched. Even the scariest 
disintegrates under a second 
viewing — neither makeup nor 
special 
effect 
nor 
narrative 

arc can launch itself very far 
without the element of surprise 
propelling it. “It Follows” is 
different. Traditional scares still 
abound in the film, mechanized 
by the now-famous score and 
figures that loom into central 
focus. But just as “It Follows” 
raids the toolbox for formal 
techniques, its real sticking 
power is less synthetic.

“Sticks” is a fitting word. 

After all, the fear “It Follows” 
generates isn’t of the atomized 
variety, like in a movie like “The 
Conjuring” where the monster 
can be categorized, and there-
fore predicted, by its phenome-
non. The monster of “It Follows” 
is formless: With no backstory or 
recognizable figure, the monster 
is a flytrap for the characters’ 
various psychic configurations. 
Fathers and mothers take on the 
nude form of “it,” a trick which 
exploits our visceral disgust to 
anything Oedipal.

The movie harnesses yet 

another 
Freudian 
principal, 

the uncanny. On one hand, 
unheimlich, its German term, 
connotes 
the 
familiar 
and 

at-home; on the other hand, its 
second meaning refers to the 
concealed and secret. So the 
word itself holds a dialectic 
set of meanings at its pole and 

antipode: the domestic and the 
strange. Under the uncanny, the 
entire landscape becomes fair 
game for this ambivalent hold. 
“It Follows” plasters pulpy 
references across the screen 
— 
female 
protagonist 
Jay’s 

lurid blonde hair and lingerie 
glisten 
in 
the 
moonlight 

while she makes seamy love 
in an old sedan’s backseat. 
But the film’s most potent 
chemical for the uncanny is 
nostalgia. Teen crushes are 
imbued 
with 
life-or-death 

stakes; childhood friends band 
together to ambush the monster 
like the gang in Scooby Doo. 
Though Michigan natives will 
recognize some locations, the 
suburbs are indistinguishable 
from Anywhere, USA. Most 
importantly, parental figures 
are 
reduced 
to 
generic 

peripheral blurs that hover in 
the background.

And instead of thrusting the 

teens into the realities of adult-
hood and responsibility, the 
monster is an extension of ado-
lescence. After all, the purely 
physical aspect of sex is not the 
ground that the monster preys 
on. Rather, it’s teenage sex’s 
clearinghouse of lore — its urban 
myths, its allures, negotiations 
and anxieties — that produces 
the monster. Even the name 
“it,” which is all one can call the 
monster, turns a condition into a 
taboo. If a 30-year-old contracted 
“it,” she would go to a doctor cov-
ered by ObamaCare or take the 
morning-after pill. But for the 
adolescent sequestered from the 
adult world’s decisive rationality, 

the monster festers.

This dark side that dims ado-

lescence’s halcyon glow marks “It 
Follows” ’s turn into the uncan-
ny, because there is something 
off about the world. Unlatched 
from temporal referents, the film 
derives its nostalgia from cans of 
soda with brands that don’t exist 
and a strange e-reader nestled 
in a clamshell compact, all cast 
under a Polaroid hue. The result 
is a familiarity that is hollow, a 
nostalgia that rings false. Even 
the camera lacks a grip on iden-
tity. In one shot, Jay, tied down 
to a wheelchair, shudders. And 
almost imperceptibly, the camera 
shudders as well, as if it forgets 
who it is. It forgets what its job is 
too. During moments of suspense, 
the camera discards its role to 
telescope details with a hyper-
aesthete’s eye, lingering on vivid 
green grass à la “Blue Velvet” or 
a shock of shimmering hair. In 
another much talked about shot, 
Jay and company talks to a school 
administrator as the camera scans 
the office in a slow, 360-degree 
circle of paranoia, trying to appre-
hend if “it” is among the strangers 
in the room.

The evaluative index for a 

scary movie comes down to “does 
it scare you?” “It Follows” doesn’t 
just scare, it crawls under your 
skin and casts the film’s aesthetic 
gaze on everything you see. I saw 
“It Follows” twice. The first time 
I jumped more, the second time I 
was no less engaged. The adrena-
line spikes are exhaustible, but 
what pervades is the sense of 
dread — not an accelerating anxi-
ety, but a deadening gloom.

fear in ‘It Follows’

The Kellogg Eye Center looks 

a lot like Hogwarts.

At least, from where I’m 

standing it does. I’m in the 
heart of Riverside Park on 
a very cloudy, very British 
day. The grass looks mossy; 
my boots are getting wet and 
muddy. The Kellogg Eye Center 
is peaking through the back of 
the field, its impressive stature 
reminding me of J.K. Rowling’s 
famed school of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry despite the two’s 
architectural differences. But 

all that doesn’t matter. There’s 
a quidditch game going on.

Founded 
in 
2010 
and 

originally 
a 
subset 
of 
the 

Michigan 
Muggles, 
the 

University’s quidditch team is 
on the rise. Later this month, 
they’re sending a 21-person 
roster to the World Cup in Rock 
Hill, South Carolina, where 
they’ll be among 80 other teams 
from around the country — and 
they’re doing all this with a 
less-than-magical catch.

“Having a broom between 

your legs is really hard,” said 
LSA 
junior 
Lisa 
Lavelanet, 

quidditch team beater. “It’s just 

very foreign for people, so it’s 
hard to really gauge how good 
they’re gonna be once they get 
used to it.”

Though 
growing 
in 

popularity, quidditch remains 
a bit of a mystery to the typical 
sports-minded public. The team 
broke it down for me.

“It’s a poor man’s lacrosse, 

basically,” said keeper Eric 
Wasser, 
a 
University 
alum. 

“There’s no sticks, but you’re 
still scoring on, you know, a 
pitch — four on four with the 
quaffle play, with the added 
addition 
of 
dodgeballs 
as 

bludgers. And those bludgers, if

you get hit by one thrown by the 
other team, you have to step out 
of the play and touch your own 
hoops before you can continue 
playing in any way.”

LSA 
junior, 
quidditch 

publicity 
chair 
and 
chaser 

Meaghan O’Connell notes the 
roughness of the game.

“I kind of call it a mix 

between rugby and handball. 
The rugby part is because it is 
full contact,” O’Connell said. 
“We don’t do it much at practice 
because we’re trying not to kill 
each other, but if you go to a 
tournament, you see people just 
getting tackled, like full-out 
taken down.”

Prior sports experience is 

a must. Everyone on the team 
has some athletic background, 
according to Wasser. No spell 
can poof you away from the 
tackling, sprinting, throwing 
and catching.

“If 
you’ve 
never 
played 

contact sports and you’re not 
comfortable getting hit, this is 
not the place for you,” Lavelanet 
said, chuckling. “People figure 
that out pretty quickly once 
they’re actually at tryouts.”

A standard broom-riddled 

year looks like this: after 
advertising at Festifall and 
gaining solid exposure, tryouts 
happen right after Welcome 
Week. 
Midwestern 
regional 

qualifiers are in early November 
— and then there’s April’s 
coveted World Cup. Even when 
they’re given a break from this 
hectic schedule, the team still 
must stay in shape.

“Especially because we have 

an off-season, I’ve gotten more 
disciplined. When we’re not 
playing in the winter, we do 
workouts on our own. A lot of 
us have started lifting, which 
I didn’t have to do in high 
school,” O’Connell said. “It’s a 

lot of like doing stuff on your 
own, knowing that it’s going to 
pay off in the spring.”

Wasser 
recognizes 
the 

dedication the seemingly trivial 
sport demands, as well.

“90 percent of the team who’s 

going to World Cup works out 
three or four days a week and 
stuff. It’s just like any other 
sport in that aspect, and we 
get looked down upon because 
it’s quidditch, but at the same 
time, for most of us, we don’t 
even think about Harry Potter 
at all,” Wasser said.

That last statement was an 

Avada Kedavra to my heart. 
“Really?” I inquired.

“For me, there’s no more 

Harry Potter,” Wasser said. “I 
read Harry Potter as a kid, and 
then, like, I don’t know. I came 
out to play this because I didn’t 
wanna like commit to a super 
serious club sport or varsity sport 
in college. This is more relaxed; 
we have more control over it 
because it’s all student-run, but 
like when we’re actually playing, 
it’s serious.”

O’Connell elaborated on the 

death of The Boy Who Lived in her 
teammates’ eyes.

“I was like, ‘Oh, quidditch! It’s 

Harry Potter! That’s cool!’ when 
I was like interested from the 
beginning, but, like Eric said, after 
my first week of practice I wasn’t 
thinking about it,” O’Connell said.

“I feel like I’m a huge anomaly,” 

Lavelanet said. “I’m a super-fan. I 
love it so much. I like it probably 
more than the rest of the whole 
team combined.”

All three answered promptly 

when asked what their favorite 
books were, though. For Wasser, 
it’s “The Order of the Phoenix;” 
O’Connell likes “The Prisoner of 
Azkaban,” and “The Chamber 
of Secrets” occupies a particular 
place in Lavelanet’s memory.

“I’m really attached to two 

because two was like the first one 
I could really, like, read on my 
own at a good pace, just because 
I was little when they came out,” 
Lavelanet said. “So I have, like, a 
special attachment to that one.”

Though small in numbers at 

today’s practice due to injuries and 
the like, passion is not lost among 
the team. O’Connell is eager to tell 
me about one of the coolest real-
life revisions quidditch has to offer. 
In the Wizarding World, tiny gold 
spheres are self-navigating and 
airborne, but “Muggle” quidditch 
is a little different.

“The third element we didn’t 

play with today is the snitch. So, 
that’s a person with shorts and 
like a little ball,” O’Connell said, 
gesturing to her backside.

After 18 minutes pass in a 

game, the snitch is released, 
and each team’s seeker (Harry 
Potter’s position) strives to 
catch it.

“And that kind of looks a lot like 

wrestling, like more than you’d 
expect,” Lavelanet said of the 
catching maneuver. “It’s evolved 
into being a wrestling match.”

O’Connell 
and 
Lavelanet 

hunch over and start to simulate 
a spirited, intense duel for 
me. After, Lavelanet muses on 
quidditch’s vitality.

“It’s like playing any sport. 

I feel like especially since it’s 
full contact, you’re much more 
energized — at least, for me. 
I used to play volleyball, and 
I’d always feel like there was 
something missing, and it was 
contact,” Lavelanet said. “As 
a beater, you’re out there with 
one other beater, so it’s kind of 
like you and your partner. So, 
especially if someone is like 
roughing up your partner, it’s 
definitely just like a very good — 
I don’t know, it gets you going. 
You want to win.”

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Take 
a 
moment. 
Remi-

nisce on Queen Elsa’s com-
ing-of-age, 
I’m-a-boss-
ass-bitch 
moment 
in 

“Frozen.” 
The 
ridicu-

lously catchy 
“Let It Go” 
backs 
her 

up as ice — 
crystalline, 
Disney ice — streams seam-
lessly from her hands, creat-
ing a lovely little mansion for 
her and only her. Charming, 
right?

Well, Azealia Banks ain’t 

Elsa. The queen of throw-
ing mad ice on Twitter just 
dropped her new video for 
“Ice Princess,” off the great 
Broke With Expensive Taste, 
and it’s mystifying but unde-
niably Banks.

She’s 
a 
fierce, 
frozen, 

Medusa-esque 
dictatress 

owning her throne in a uni-
verse of arctic blue. Every-
thing is surreal — from her 
army of ice robots to her giant 
chrome snake, which takes 
her wherever she needs to go 

in her gangster winter won-
derland. It’s creepy, to be sure, 
but so chill (no pun intend-
ed). The groove of the song 
matches the low-key colors 
and overall pace of the video 
— everything is going swim-
mingly, so far.

Soon, random conglomera-

tions of rainbow colors appear 
in the sky as Banks is over-
looking her splendor. So she 
goes off to battle them on that 
weird-ass snake, eventually 

freezing the volcano they’re 
coming from. But her army 
betrays her, picking at that ice 
until the volcano erupts and 
Banks is engulfed in kaleido-
scope flames. Does she die? Is 
this a metaphor for the impli-
cations of totalitarian leader-
ship or her career?

We’ll never know. Banks is 

a super-diva enigma. That’s 
the madness and the genius of 
the “Ice Princess.”

EPISODE REVIEW

“The Fosters” can be a deeply 

frustrating 
show 
sometimes. 

There 
are 

times 
where 

it, brilliantly, 
tells 
stories 

untouched by 
anything else 
on television. 
Yet, its need 
to amp up the 
drama to arti-
ficial 
levels 

plays 
other 

moments as fake. The finale 
amplified both the good and the 
bad of the series.

The series has mostly done 

well by its two main characters, 
siblings Callie (Maia Mitch-
ell, “Teen Beach Movie”) and 
Jude (Hayden Byerly, “Parent-
hood”), and the finale was no 
exception, bringing both of their 
season-long arcs to their natu-
ral conclusions. The moment 
between Callie and her father, 
Robert (Kerr Smith, “Life Unex-
pected”), allowed their relation-
ship to deepen to a point where 
they actually felt like father and 
daughter. Over the course of the 
season, the series did an excel-
lent job portraying the relation-

ship between Jude and Connor 
(Gavin MacIntosh, “Parks and 
Recreation”). The moment when 
Jude finally calls Connor his 
boyfriend is a beautiful payoff to 
their love story.

However, what doesn’t work 

about the finale is the cliffhang-
er ending involving Mariana, 
Jesus and Anna crashing their 
car. The episode takes a slow 
approach, showing them driv-
ing, then Anna going into labor, 
then the decision to continue 
driving despite that, then the 911 

call stating there was “one con-
firmed fatality.” It was a mad-
dening way of building tension, 
ultimately ending in a crash that 
wouldn’t have been there if it 
wasn’t the finale. It felt artificial 
and out-of-place from the rest of 
the episode.

It’s a shame that the series 

had to force a cliffhanger ending, 
because the other stories involv-
ing Callie and Jude were lovely 
closings to their arcs and the sea-
son as a whole.
