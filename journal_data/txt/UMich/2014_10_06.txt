Rich Magner, the owner
of Blimpy Burger, was in
the kitchen. He opened the
fridge to check on the ham-
burger meat, which he and
his employees still prepare
the old-fashioned way: hand-
grinding it.
Once he finished checking
the beef, he returned to his vat
of onion ring coating, mixing
in vinegar and then pouring in
a barrel of raw onions. He then

strained the onions before
covering them in seasoning
and a dry rub.
At one point, he turned
away from the work and said
with a weary grin, "Let's be
honest. The bottom line is
that we're tired."
Blimpy re-opened Friday
at 304 South Ashley Street
- just over a year after clos-
ing its original location on
South Division and Packard.

Robert Axelrod takes
interdisciplinary
approach to social
science inquiry
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
President Barack Obama's Friday
announcement of this year's recipi-
ents of the National Medal of Science
included, among nine others, Univer-
sity Prof. Robert Axelrod. The award
is "our Nation's highest honors for
achievement and leadership inadvanc-
ing the fields of science and technol-
ogy," according to a White House press
release.
The President will honor Axelrod
andhis fellowmedalrecipientswithaan
Oval Office ceremony and dinner.
"These scholars and innovators
have expanded our understanding of
the world, made invaluable contribu-
tions to their fields, and helped improve
countless lives," Obama said in a White
House press release. "Our nation has
been enriched by their achievements,
and by all the scientists and technolo-

gists across America dedicated to dis-
covery,inquiry, and invention."
In a Friday interview, Axelrod said
he was informed of the award by the
White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy earlier this week.
He added that he was especially excit-
ed to be the first political scientist to be
honored with the award.
Axelrod is currently spending the
academic year at the U.S. State Depart-
ment as a Jefferson Science Fellow, a
program that promotes cooperation
between scientific experts and the gov-
ernment. His areas of focus are nation-
al security policy and mathematical
models of politics, making his work
very interdisciplinary.
He encouraged students to branch
out andtake classes across the Univer-
sity to get a truly interdisciplinary and
well-roundededucation.
"Don't settle on a focus for your
career or your major too early,"he said.
"Look around at all kinds of stuff at
the University ... Find a good teacher
and take a course almost regardless
of what they're teaching. Follow your
nose in terms ofwhatinterestsyou.You
don't have to explain those interests to

Silicon Valley
business incubator
offers office hours
to entrepreneurs
By RACHEL PREMACK
DailyNewsEditor
The Silicon Valley startup
business incubator that invest-
ed in Reddit, Airbnb and more
than 700 other tech companies
visited Ann Arbor Friday to
hear student pitches and dis-
cuss entrepreneurship.
Qasar Younis, a partner from
Y-Combinator, which accepts
less than 3 percent of applicants
to its intensive seed accelera-
tor program, as well as Jesse
Vollmar, a co-founder of a YC-
backed startup, spoke about
how to compose a solid team
of founders, campus entrepre-
neurship resources, the value
of not working for a corporation
and other related topics. More
than 100 students crowded into

a room at TechArb in down-
town Ann Arbor to hear the talk
and visit office hours with YC
officials.
MPowered Entrepreneur-
ship hosted the event. LSA
senior Saad Jangda, vice presi-
dent of programs for MPow-
ered, said YC's visit to the
University shows that Michi-
gan's entrepreneurial icons are
noting the University's startup
savvy.
"This is big," Jangda said.
-"And I keep telling everyone it's
big because it means that people
have started noticing that Mich-
igan is a place for entrepreneur-
ship. It's something we've been
tryingto do for 10 years now."
"It's not just about Silicon
Valley anymore, it's about the
Silicon Mitten."
YC is rated first among
business accelerators
by publications such as
TechCrunch and Forbes. Its
three-month-long program
provides seed funding, which

Daily StaffReporter
After a tumultuous week for
the Athletic Department, the
athletic community gathered
together to show their support
for the football team with a
formal send off.
Student-athletes, coaches,

athletic administrators
and alumni gathered in
Schembechler Hall Friday
afternoon to cheer on the
football team as they boarded
the buses to Piscataway, New
Jersey for Saturday's game at
Rutgers University.
The energy was positive at
the indoor field. Pompoms were
passed out to students as they
created a tunnel down the center
of the field. Members ofthe base-
ball and volleyball teams came
dressed in uniform.
"We thought it would be a

great way to show our support
for our football team, cheer
them on, let them know we got
their back and that we are here
as a family," Associate Athletic
Director David Ablauf said.
The Student Athlete Advisory
Council, a committee consist-

'U' hit with drop in state support

Forty years ago this week
(Oct.9,1974)
Republican Gov. William
Milliken warned University
President Robben Fleming
to expect at least a 4-percent
decrease in state funding for the
1975-1976 academic year.
Milliken also instructed
Fleming that "tuition increases
and enrollment decreases are not
viable alternatives" to compensate
for the lower funding. ,
However, Fleming said he
wouldn't rule out a tuition increase
and saw no other path toward
increasing University revenue.
"Our financial future is a
very serious problem and I don't
know the answer to it," he told

the University community in his
annual State of the University
speech earlier that week. "This is
the most dismal financial picture
we've faced inthe lastdecade."
Twenty-eightyearsagothis
week(Oct.9,1986)
Members ofthe Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs
asked University administrators
to form a committee to review
spendingpriorities.
The request followed a five-year
study on funds distribution at the
University conducted by a SACUA
subcommittee, which led to the
sentiment among some faculty
membersthatcertaindepartments
are routinelyoverlooked.

First U.S. Ebola case leads
to travel ban consideration

H--,m

Health officials
advise maintaining
open borders
(AP) - Top government health
officials said Sunday that they
are opposed to placing a ban on
travelers from Ebola-infected
countries, warning that shutting
down borders could impede
efforts by aid workers to stop the
spread of the deadly virus.
The idea of a ban gained cur-
rency this past week after the na-
tion's first case was diagnosed in
Dallas. Proponents have argued
that it would help ensure public
safety.
Anthony'Fauci, director of the
National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, part of the
National Institutes of Health,
said a travel embargo on West
African countries that are strug-
gling with Ebola would make it
much harder for them to control
the virus.
"You isolate them, you can
cause unrest in the country," Fau-
ci told "Fox News Sunday." "It's
conceivable that governments
could fall if you just isolate them
completely."
British Airways and some oth-
er airlines have suspended flights
from those countries, and overall
traffic to and from the affected
areas has dropped.
Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois
Republican, has said the federal

government should gradually
halt flights to the region to pro-
tect Americans. Rep. Tim Mur-
phy plans to conduct hearings
on the policy this coming week.
He leads the House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations.
Asking travelers to report their
own activities at airports "has
been a demonstrated failure, and
it is nearly impossible to retrace
steps to try and track down ev-
eryone who has been in contact
with a carrier taking multiple
international flights across the
globe," Murphy, a ,Pennsylvania
Republican, said Friday.
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal,
a physician, said the U.S. should
halt flights from Ebola-stricken
countries.
"The Obama administration
keeps saying they won't shut
down flights. They instead say
we should listen to 'the experts,"'
Jindal said Friday. 4In fact, they
said it would be counterproduc-
tive to stop these flights. That
statement defies logic.'
Tom Frieden, director of the
federal Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, said on ABC's
"This Week" that the administra-
tion was open to practical sugges-
tions that won't backfire.
"We don't want to do some-
thing that inadvertently increas-
es our risk by making it harder
to stop the outbreak there, be-
cause if it spreads more widely
throughout different countries in
Africa, that will be even more of

a risk to us," said Frieden, whose
agency has cautioned against
non-essential travel to Liberia,
Sierra Leone and Guinea.
Frieden has also noted that a
ban on incoming flights could af-
fect Americans trying to return
home from those countries.
"There are many other people
who have the right to enter into
this country," he said during a
Saturday briefing. "And we're not
going to be able to get to zero risk
no matter what we do unless and
until- we control the outbreak in
West Africa."
An airline passenger traveling
from Liberia to Dallas brought
Ebola into the U.S. last month. He
is hospitalized in isolation, and
public-health officials are moni-
toring a few dozen people who
may have been exposed to the
virus.
U.S. officials have empha-
sized that the United States has
a modern medical system that is
far better equipped to contain an
outbreak than the African coun-
tries where Ebola is currently
spreading. ,
Airline passengers have their
temperatures taken as they board
planes in the outbreak zone, al-
though those infected with Ebola
can go up to 21 days before they
exhibit symptoms. Passengers
are also asked about contact with
infected people, but that process
would not be useful if a passenger
lies or simply does not realize the
medical condition of people they
have encountered.

EBOLA UPDATES
DALLAS
U.S. Ebola patient
in worse condition
After hospital officials on
Saturday said the condition of
the lone Ebola patient diag-
nosed in the U.S. has worsened,
the woman he came to Texas to
visit said she is praying for his
recovery.
Louise Troh said thatshe was
not aware until a reporter told
her that Thomas Eric Duncan's
condition had been deemed crit-
ical and that she had not spoken
with him Saturday.
"I pray in Jesus' name that it
will be all right," Troh said in
a telephone interview from the
home where she and three oth-
ers are being isolated.
Texas Health Presbyterian
Hospital Dallas didn't provide
any further details or respond
to questions about Duncan's
health on Saturday.
WORCESTER, Mass.
Doctor treated for
Ebola hospitalized
A doctor admitted to a
Massachusetts hospital this
weekend for an apparent respi-
ratory infection after surviving
the Ebolavirus was instable con-
dition and feeling better Sunday,
but still has a fever and cough,
hospital officials said as they
awaited Ebola testing results.
Officials at UMass Memorial
Medical Center in Worcester
said Dr. Richard Sacra remained
in isolation as a precaution. He
was admitted Saturday and is
being treated for an upper respi-
ratory infection that doctors
believe is not related to Ebola he
contracted in Africa.
Dr. Robert Finberg, who is
leading Sacra's medical team,
said at a news conference Sun-
day that doctors are confident
Sacra's symptoms are not related
to the Ebola he contracted in
Africa.

LOS ANGELES
Heat spikes in Calif.,
as does drought
Temperatures approached triple
digits in much of California on Sat-
urday afternoon and surpassed100
degrees in inland areas as a steam-
ing autumn in the state seemed
more like an endless summer.
Heat in the low 90s was felt in
the normally temperate San Fran-
cisco Bay Area, and it reached the
upper 90s in the Sacramento area.
Throngs of thousands who
crammed Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco for the annual Hardly
Strictly Bluegrass festival were
chugging water and dumping it
on their heads as they danced
to banjos and fiddles in the mid-
day swelter, with many wearing
shorts and little else.
The mercury was at 95 degrees
in downtown Los Angeles by mid-
day and over 100 in the suburbs of
San Bernardino County.

BLIMPY
From Page 1A
"Grand 0," who is propped up
adjacent to the cash register.
The polar bears stem from an
old tradition. Blimpy Burger's
mascot is a bear, and Magner built
snow-bears outside the restaurant
one winter in the 1990s to attract
clientele. Since then, the joint has
been celebrating polar bears even
when the sun is shining.
Tom and Johanna Westrick,
who are from Dundee, Michigan,
were the first to get their burgers.
Tom got two double burgers with
cheese, mustard, ketchup, pickle
and onion, while Johanna had
one double with cheese, lettuce,
tomato and mayonnaise.
"We've been waiting all sum-
mer for it to open, so we thought
we'd come down and check it
out," Tom said.
The two, who live 30 minutes
south of Ann Arbor, have been
Blimpy Burger patrons for years.
"I worked in Ann Arbor and
used to eat there numerous times
per week," Tom said. "(The food
is) just like I remember it. Seems

like it was still at the old place."
Returning customers report-
ed they like the new restaurant,
which is roomier than the old
space. This one provides a sepa-
rate ramp on the side where cus-
tomers can line up and order, as
opposed to queuing in between
tables as they used to.
However, one customer,
21-year-old William Scott, an
Ann Arbor resident, said it's "too
clean and too new," and that he
misses "that vintage feel, like the
resurrected from some hole-in-
the wall back in the '50s feel."
"They could put some laminate
flooring down so it gets sticky
again, that would be nice," he
said.
Small details aside, Magner
said the feedback has been posi-
tive.
"Most of the comments that
I've had arethat the burgers taste
the same," Magner said.
Magner and his wife, Chris,
said it has been a long year pre-
ceding the business' re-opening.
They closed in Aug. 2013; their
final days had queues up to three
hours long.
The couple was originally con-
sidering a storefront on East Wil-

liam Street, which fell through,
before choosing their current
location on Ashley. They also ran
an Indiegogo campaign which
raised 34 percent of its $60,000
goal.
Blimpy had a soft-opening
last week, where Magner invited
50 people who were involved in
getting the restaurant running
again.
Ultimately, they said they were
happy to be back.
"It means a lot of things to a
lot of people," Chris said. "Just
because of the years they've been
here and been goingto it."
Nostalgia was pervasive as
customers filled the eatery, many
discussing their meal plans and
Blimpy memories.
University alum Herm Stein-
man began eating at Blimpy
Burger in 1958.
"I'm at the point where if I
don't have my Blimpy fix at least
once a month; I get shaky," he said
after finishing his burger. "I have
brought two wives, several girl-
friends, four kids, seven grandkids
and one great-grandkid so far."
Steinman's enthusiasm for
Blimpy extends beyond inhaling
cheeseburgers: he's known to

provide in-house tunes. A bag-
pipe player for 30 years, Stein-
man has marked several Blimpy
milestones in a kilt and the Celt-
ic wind instrument.
"I piped 'em out when they
closed the other one, and I piped
'em in. I'm the house piper,"
Steinman said. He also plays at
weddings and funerals, even
having performed at the funer-
al of the restaurant's original
owner.
What Steinman said he loves
most about Blimpy is the rap-
port. As a regular customer for
the last 56 years, employees
know his order by heart. For
years, he brought his grandkids
here as a last day of school tra-
dition.
He taught them how to order
in the Blimpy way. The cook
asks if you're ordering anything
fried, you respond; the cook
asks how many burgers you're
having, you respond; the cook
asks what you want on your
burger(s), you respond; the cook
asks what kind of bun you want,
you respond; the cook asks if
you'd like the bread to be grilled,
you respond.
Customers who diverge from

this system risk getting yelled at.
"If you weren't embarrassed
at Blimpy's, you should feel
offended," Steinman said.
The favorite memory of
another loyal patron, Ann Arbor
resident Daniel Webber, involves
just that. Webber, who came to
the opening with his mother
Nancy, has been frequenting
Blimpy for 12 years.
Former University President
Mary Sue Coleman was in line in
front of Webber once and would
not get off her phone. Phone
chatting while in line is verbo-
ten at Blimpy's.
"This 50-year-old woman
who used to work here came
and grabbed her by her arm and
pulled her out of line," Webber
said. "(Coleman) said, 'Do you
know who I am?' and the lady
said, 'Yes, leaving."'
Ann Arbor resident Jeania
Getty has eaten at Blimpy for the
last 25 years. She said Blimpy is
"the only place and time that I
ever drink chocolate milk." The
beverage, alongside a triple burg-
er with provolone on an onion
roll with everything on it, is her
tradition - one of many that were
revisited on Friday.


MEDAL

exciting to you and you don't even
have toknow why."
Axelrod received a B.A. in
mathematics from the University
of Chicago in 1964 and completed
his Ph.D. with distinction at Yale
University in 1969. Prior to com-
ing to University, he was an assis-
tant professor in the University of
California, Berkeley Department
of Political Science.
He came to the University in
1974 and holds joint appointments
in the Department of Political Sci-
ence and Gerald R. Ford School of
Public Policy. In 2006, he became
the Mary Ann and Charles R.
Walgreen Professor for the Study
of Human Understanding, and
received the Regents' Award for

Distinguished Public Service in
201.
If given the chance to speak
with the President, Axelrod said
he had a couple areas he would be
interested in addressing.
"I'd like to talk to him about
America's role inthe world," Axel-
rod said. "About how we can con-
tribute to international peace and
global prosperity, without ... disre-
specting other cultures."
He added that he'd also like
to talk about the U.S. economy,
especially in regards to income
inequality and the distorting
effects of money in elections.
"I know the economic difficul-
ties we've had in the Great Reces-
sion have somewhat undermined
our own self-confidence, but as
the economy gets better I think
we'll restore our sense of valuing
our own potential at home and
abroad."

SUPPORT
From Page 1A
participating in big competitions
or tournaments, such as the
NCAA Final Four, Ablauf said.
"Our goal is to help the student
athletes and coaches," he said.
"We want to go out and support
them, weather it is in celebration,
weather it is in time of need, for
whatever reason or what ever they
are going to do."
Junior Volleyball player Olivia
Reed found out about the send off
through e-mails from her SAAC
representatives. Right before leav-
ing for Michigan State, the volley-
ball team found it important to
support their football team, Reed
said.
"Right now it is important for
all of us to come together as a

community," Reed said. "To be
supportive of our football team
as they are maybe going through
a harder time than we would
expect."
Senior Baseball player Eric
Jacobson also attended with his
teammates before their afternoon
practice.
"We really want to show the
football team that we have a lot of
faith in them and that their suc-
cess is important to us," Jacobson
said."In light of the negativity
there are still positives to be found
in our community.
The football team has a 2-3
record going into its game against
Rutgers, and the program itself
has been criticized with regards
to its coaching staff.
Students rallied Tuesday call-
ing for Athletic Director Dave
Brandon to be removed from
his position. Brandon is directly

responsible for football coach
Brady Hoke's performance,which
is under scrutiny from media out-
lets for his handling of sophomore
quarterback Shane Morris' con-
cussion in the team's game against
Minnesotalast week.
"Obviously this week has been
tough on our football program,"
Ablauf said. "We wanted those
student-athletes to know that we
are all here, we are supporting
them, we are going to give them
all the energy we possibly can, so
they can go out and have a great
game on Saturday."
Ablauf said players and coach-
es need to stay focused and the
send off was just part of that ini-
tiative.
"You want to try to keep things
as normal as possible for them and
not alter their routine," Ablauf
said. "I think we have been able to
do that."


ACCELERATOR

during is earliest stage, as well as
advice from YC partners about
how to develop ideas and pitch
startups to potential investors.
Prominent techies also host
weekly talks for YC participants,
including speakers like Facebook
co-Founder Mark Zuckerberg.
The experience culminates in
a Demo Day, in which about 450
top investors hear presentations
from YC-backed startups and
- hopefully - invest in the
fledgling companies.
University alum Harry
Zhang, co-founder of Lob, a San
Francisco-based printing and
mailing service, participated in
YC in the summer of 2013. The
company has since raised $9.4
million from investors, according
to CrunchBase.
"Overall, it's easily the best
incubator in Silicon Valley and
has one of the best brand names
in the Silicon Valley community,"
Zhang said.
He said the advice and
structured program that YC
offered were invaluable.
"It helps you sort of get the
traction that you need to launch
your startup in a structured
environment," Zhang said. "It
helps you internalize what the
most important thing is that you
should be focusing your time
on when you're building your
company."
The YC-backed company that
was represented at the event
was FarmLogs, an Ann Arbor-
based company focused on
servicing farms and optimizing
crop rotation. FarmLogs CEO
Jesse Vollmar co-founded the
company in 2012, and it has since
produced a profit of $5 million.
Vollmar presented a storyline
of FarmLogs' early days. After
he and his co-founders were
accepted into YC, via an e-mail
that "completely changed (his)
life," he moved to San Francisco,
lived in a tiny apartment with
only an Ikea mattress on his floor
and assumed 100-hour work
weeks of coding - 14 hours per
day, every day.
"Our life just became
completely consumed by the
startup," Vollmar said.
He emphasized the need
to find co-founders who were
equally dedicated to the intensive

lifestyle, after one person in
his three-person team left one
month into the YC program.
"We weren't on the same
page," Vollmar said. "We didn't
all have an agreement that we
were going to pour everything
we had into this company. It's
something that you should
definitely get straight is building
a strong relationship with your
co-founders first."
YC partner Younis echoed
tlis sentiment during his
talk. Younis, whose feedback
platform TalkBin was acquired
and then phased out by Google,
also discouraged attraction to
the image of the dropout startup
founder, such as Bill Gates, Steve
Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.
Younis also emphasized the
value of working for oneself
rather than for a corporation. He
said the latter option often offers
a larger salary and more security,
but foraying into the startup
world is a priceless experience.
After the talk, University
students with early-stage
startups had the opportunity to
have 10-minute office hours with
Younis.
One attendant was
Engineering alum Tim Jones,
the founder and chief technology
officer of Cribspot, a housing
website that he said has helped
more than 60,000 students find
housing since September 2013.
After attending office hours, he
said he is considering applying
to YC.
"Y-Combinator is really
focused on high-growth
companies," Jones said. "You
have to grow or you die. Office
hours really emphasized how
we need to stay focused and
that every week we should grow
7 to 10 percent. That's really
important to us."
Business senior Jay Raina
said the office hours with Younis
gave him "great wisdom." He is
in the process of establishing
an app that will allow users to
pay their bills at restaurants
electronically, cutting waits of
up to half an hour to process
credit cards and split checks.
"This is absolutely a problem
that needs to be solved and
several people have attempted
to solve this problem but they
failed," Raina said. "One big
takeaway (Younis) gave us is to
look at those failures and avoid
them to make sure our app is
successful."

in place.
Current legislation requires driv-
ersto stopforpedestriansifthey are
standing at a curb, curb line or ramp
leading to a crosswalk. The new
ordinance would amend that rule to
include the phrase,"If the driver can
do so safely."
In December 2013, Mayor John
Hieftje vetoed an amendment that
was passed by the City Council to
maintain the requirement that driv-
ers stop for waiting pedestrians.
The amended ordinance would still
require drivers to stop, but would
add language to protect drivers
who are unable to safely stop before
reaching a crosswalk.
Resolution/Ordinance:
Doglicensing
The City Council will be pre-
sented with a resolution and ordi-
nance pertaining to the fees and
procedures associated with dog
licensing in Ann Arbor. In its sec-
ond reading, following little con-
versation at the previous meeting,
councilmembers will discuss
eliminating an explicit fee from
the original dog leasing ordinance

and adding different time length
options for owners.
The new resolution will
determine the fees that will apply
to each corresponding license
time. The ordinance is meant to
offer citizens more options when
purchasing tags and to allow the
establishment of online licensing
procedures.
Ordinance: Stormwater
Management and Soil Erosion
and Sedimentation Control
Water Resources Commission-
er Evan N. Pratt has submitted a
request to the Council to amend
current rules and regulations sur-
rounding pollution caused by con-
struction in Washtenaw County,
including the city of Ann Arbor.
The University is required to
operateunder WashtenawCounty's
National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System and follow
this amended protocol. Ann Arbor
along with much of Washtenaw
County is considered an urbanized
area, meaning it requires a water
permit, which is expected to be
reissued this year. The amended
rules, which have not been updated
since 2000, are meant to better
protect the environment from
pollutants and any other adverse
effects of stormwater runoff.

MARK KILLINGSWORTH |
A tale of two programs

Last Saturday night, Rutgers, which joined
the Big Ten in July, beat Michigan, one of the
conference's founders. Michigan athletics is
reeling from a week-long public relations night-
mare. No wonder the Wolverine community is
feeling, well, seriously blue.
But the Michigan-Rutgers matchup wasn't
just a game. It highlights some of the worst
features of today's college athletics - but it also
offers a glimpse of a different future.
As an undergraduate, I loved Michigan
athletics. I've returned for homecoming,
sung "Varsity" and "The Victors" endlessly,
and walked through the Big House admiring
the displays: the winningest program, 42
conference championships and 11 national
championships - at least one every decade from
the'00s to the'40s.
But after Bennie Oosterbaan's 1948 team,
Michigan was unable to win a national title
until 1997, and after that ... nothing.
How come? Schools everywhere now hope
to vault to prominence, attract more and better
students and get more money via big-time
sports. Michigan State was one of the first,
followed by upstarts like Central Florida and
Boise State. Not surprisingly, older programs
are sometimes elbowed aside.
We haven't won national championships
lately, but we still generate enormous revenues.
Athletic program profits were over $23 million
in 2011-12, and almost $12.5 million in 2012-13,
NCAA reports.
Joining the Rutgers economics faculty in
the 1970s, I found an athletic program that was
very different from the booming enterprise in
Ann Arbor. The stadium was less than half the
size of the Big House. Rutgers played schools
like Colgate. It had traditions - after all, in
1869, Rutgers beat Princeton in the first-ever
college football game - but the program was
pretty sleepy.
Then the Board of Governors decided that
Rutgers should go big-time.
So began a long, largely unimpressive and
painfully costly saga. Simply put, Rutgers'
athletics program doesn't generate nearly
enough revenue to cover expenses, resulting
in huge annual deficits. Between 2004-
05 and 2012-13, the cumulative deficit was
$237.9 million, which Rutgers has financed by
tapping student fees (over $300 per year per
undergraduate on the New Brunswick campus)
and its discretionary fund.
In 2013, Rutgers President Robert
Barchi admitted that Rutgers athletics is
"siphoning dollars off from the academic
mission." This moment of candor has never

returned. Instead, Barchi and the BOG have
a new mantra: be patient; huge Big Ten media
revenues are coming.
But Rutgers' current financial plan for
athletics actually forecasts an additional $183
million in deficits between 2013-14 and 2021-
22, even after including these revenues. The
athletic director recently disclosed that the
2014-15 deficit will be over $4 million larger
than forecast. Last month Rutgers raised the
football coach's salary by $200,000 while telling
the library to cut $550,000 from its budget.
Michigan and Rutgers have one thing
in common: athletics is autonomous and
enormously powerful, either because itis hugely
profitable (Michigan) or because the school's
governing body is completely indifferent to
huge deficits (Rutgers).
Either way, athletics becomes a law unto
itself Rutgers athletics gets a blank check;
Rutgers academics covers it. Michigan athletics
gives back only a sliver of its profits to the
academic enterprise, and management - from
the athletic director on down - is seemingly
incapable of managing competently, as witness
the flurry of conflicting statements about the
Shane Morris affair.
In both places, commercialismruns rampant.
Rutgers Stadium is now High Point Solutions
Stadium and will have enhanced cellphone
service (does that ring a bell, Wolverines?). In
a special promotion, Michigan sold football
tickets for the price of two Cokes (the result of
yet more "miscommunication," according to
the program). Aping the NFL, the Big House
blasts Eminem over the loudspeakers instead of
featuring the marching band. Both schools run
seat-licensing schemes that let rich fans write
off high-ticket prices as a tax deduction.
No other country - not Canada, Australia or
anywhere else - has the U.S. mania for college
sports. Turning things around will be difficult.
But the protests in Ann Arbor this week mean
that change is possible. My reading of the blogs,
posts and tweets suggests that many of the pro-
testers are angry not just about the failure to
protect Shane Morris, but also about the relent-
less commercialization of Michigan athletics.
Change needs leaders as well as protesters.
It's early in Mark Schlissel's tenure, but it's not
too early for him to build a coalition with other
college presidents to get the economic insanity
of today's college athletics under control. After
all, aren't we the leaders and best?

10 years old
I shrink away at the sight of my
mother struggling to make sense of
what the tall man in the white shirt
says to her. I hunch up my shoulders
instinctively, digging my hands into
the folds of her pleated skirt as if it
would be enough to keep me still.
Keep me rooted. Keep me grounded.
He speaks harsh sounds and stings
of pain, as if he pinches, prods, and
pulls at our skins, scoffs at our fur-
rowed brows and obscenities sent
our way.
"Go back to where you came from."
I learn to become ashamed of stut-
ters and broken English; I promise to
myself I will not become my mother.
I learn to distance myself from her.
Her identity will not be mine. She
will not be a representation of me.
I'm better than that.
12 years old
"That's disgusting!"
My friends laugh, crinkling their
noses and pushing it around the
table. The distinctive smell and taste
of home becomes a joke; everything
becomes slow and sleepy and hazy.
My throat closes up and I feel
the familiar sting of burning acid
threatening to drip out of my eyes.
My friends look at me with a weary
expression, rolling their eyes and
laughing. All of a sudden, all I can
taste is my own words and laughter,
"I know, right?"
I pack up my favorite meal, and
throw it out.
I tell my mother that it was
disgusting.
Next time she asks what I want for
lunch, I point to the white bread in
favor of the white rice. Peanut butter
in exchange for the dried seaweed.
An apple replacing the kimchi.
Lunch becomes the first step away
from my parents' culture.
They're different. I don't want
to be different. I don't want to
be foreign.
I just want to be American.
13 years old
The people who looked like me
were the people I didn't want to be.
Awkwardly short with chubby faces,
we seemed to blend into each other.
I was called three different names in
the same hour.

"Lisa! No. Yuan. Wait no ... I got it
- just wait for it. It's on the tip of my
tongue. It has to be ... Susanna?"
Even in middle school, I under-
stood we were all perceived in the
same way - smart, submissive, shy,
quiet, second-rate objects to satisfy
the nearest diversity requirement.
In group projects, we were given the
most responsibility, and assumed
to complete the project on our own
means. We were talked about as the
"model minorities," the ones who
would get 'A's to attend prestigious
universities. My race, it seemed,
embraced the pressure to be perfect.
Surrounded by these representa-
tions, I believed that this was all that
I could be. All that I would ever be.
To break away from that stereotype,
I spent time unfairly judging my
own outward appearance. If I could
change what I looked like, I believed
that it would change what other peo-
ple expected of me. I thoughtthat if I
looked like other girls - tall, skinny,
shiny, and happy, I could break away
from the stereotype that followed
me. Trying to contort my body to
gain acceptance, I skipped meals and
chewed gum. My appetite and hun-
ger began to disappear. So did I.
15 years old
I wish I could say that the first
time I stuck my fingers down my
throat would be the last time I ever
did something carelessly harmful
to myself. I felt my own ghosts sink
down the drains and transform
themselves into something clear,
something pure. As if purging my
insides-would transform my bruises,
self-inflicted by my own distaste for
my appearance. It made me forget
I needed to write out an excused
absence for my sister, that I needed
to read documents and explain to my
mother what it meant in elementary
English, that I needed to find a
plausible excuse for why I wasn't
feeling up to eating lunch again.
Throwing up food to maintain my
unnaturally slim figure was some-
thing that I could control in a world
where I was being labeled, used, and
expected to hold up the image that
was thrown upon me the moment I
stepped into rooms. Purging became
a coping mechanism; it became away

of life; it began to define me,
Last year
I thought I understood my
intentions for turning my insides
out, for sticking my fingers down my
throat, for refusing anything but a
handfulofgrapes aday. I never really
thought to see how fragile it all ways,
how deep it went. Just like everyone
else, I only saw the top layer, where
I was close to the size 0 jeans and
Western standard of thin beauty, and
never cared to go to the root of the
problem. Iwasdesperate,frightened,
and my coping mechanism became
my downfall; it ate me up when I
was young and impressionable, and
I clung on to it with hopeful despair
until destruction.
Now
Living with an eating disorder is
a permanent battle between what
I know is right and what I feel is
right. After multiple fainting spells
and even greater health problems, I
steadily forced myself to eat three
meals a day and keep it inside my
stomach. However, I began to feel
as if I was losing a piece of myself
with the improvement of my health.
I felt as if I had no control over who
I was becoming.
This feeling of helplessness is
what makes it easy to fall back
into familiar patterns. It's easy to
resort to a coping mechanism that
seemed to quench my thirst for
control because the number on the
scale was the only tie I had with
self-confidence. Just as it became
easier to allow others' preconceived
notions of what I should be to sculpt
me into an image of impossibility.
I never once tried to explain that
their idea of perfection based on my
race eventually molded me into a
misunderstood mask of repressed
desire for control over who I wanted
to be. My weight became represen-
tative of everything that I desired
to attain but was out of my reach -
acceptance, perfection, admiration,
assimilation into American society
when I looked and was born into
someone that seemed completely
misaligned with stereotypical social
norms. Similarly, my weight became
the only thing that I felt I could con-

trol about myself. Every
pound I lost became a step
further from the bookish, nerdy
Asian stereotype and a step
closer to attaining a beach body
of Californian girls who were
attractive, alluring, accepted. It
was hard to ignore expectations,
but it was harder still to change
myself to meet different
standards. I always thought that
people wouldn't accept me until
I perfectly met these irrational
demands of societal convention.
It's hard to understand the

essence of acceptance, and it's
hard to describe the transition
from self-hatred to self-love.
I still have some days when I
wake up and shrink away at
the sight of my skin, pinching,
prodding, and pulling at my ribs.
But most days, I know that it's
okay to be in love with myself.
That it's okay to care about me.
I understand that I'm not vain
when I look into the mirror to
admire what my weight gain has
done to me. I'm not conceited
when all I am is looking out for
myself when I need it the most.
I would much rather be called
arrogant than be shamed for,
admiring the person that I've

grown to be so proud of.
It's through this journey that I
realized that I'm not invincible;
I found out that I'm a little more
than a larger pile of mistakes.
It allowed me to grow, to know
that I'm no longer afraid of
disappointing others or proving
them wrong.
I'm not afraid of not being
perfect.

High: Optimism
Broadcast television rat-
ings have eroded so quickly
over the past few years that
each premiere week, the only
silver lining is that it wasn't
that bad. No,really. It wasn't
that bad. ABC's "Thank God
It's Thursday" Shondaland-
infused lineup brought in
huge numbers - including big
gains for flagship "Scandal"
at a time when veteran series
continue to decline. NBC's
"The Blacklist" showed signs
that a possible sophomore
surge is on its way, while
"The Voice" and "Chicago
Fire" continued to be reliable
players. CBS continued to
thrive in the <em>My Grand-
ma loves that show</em>
market (three hours of its
schedule now have "NCIS" in
the title). And even FOX had
a few great premieres with
"Gotham" and its "Family
Guy"/"Simpsons" crossover,
even if that's all that can be
said about the network.
Low: FOX
And finally, here we are.
While many insiders - and
outsiders - were looking at
ABC to take the unwanted
title of "being the new NBC,"
FOX has not only earned
the distinction, but forged
an entirely new low for net-
works to fear. For years, the
perennially fourth-place
NBC was the industry laugh-
ing stock. But with Robert
Greenblatt (formerly of
Showtime) at the helm, NBC
has corrected course in an
astonishing way, emerging as
the No. 1 network last year
and holding onto its lead
early this fall. But for FOX,
the story is an entirely differ-
ent one. Once No. 1 for many
consecutive years, thanks in
no small part to "American
Idol," the network is now
nearly devoid of bright spots.
"New Girl," still the net-
work's biggest comedy debut
in 13 years, and its compan-
ion "The Mindy Project" are
now blips on viewers' radars.
New series "Red Band Soci-
ety," "Gracepoint" and "Uto-
pia" (the latter of which has
already been pulled from both
of its nights on the sched-
ule) all premiered to dismal
numbers while older series
"Sleepy Hollow" and "Bones"
have taken year-over-year
hits. FOX is going to need a
hero to get out of its increas-
ingly desperate situation,
but unfortunately, in prequel
series "Gotham," Batman
won't be around to save the
day for another 20 years.

Director
John R.
Leonetti has done it again:
After working on such movies
as "Insidious" and "The
Conjuring" he's developed an
elegant philosophy on scaring
people. Keep it simple. Take it
slow. There's no hurry. Put the
audience in charge. Keep a wide
camera angle. Let them see
things. And make them believe.
This is why his movies speak
to fears that we all really hold.
There's something scarier about
demons and spirits than there is
about ghosts. We don't believe
in ghosts, says Leonetti, but we
believe in demons and spirits.
So just as in "Insidious" and
"The Conjuring", Leonetti
appeals to the religious
sensibilities of the audience.
The priest, Father Perez (Tony
Amendola, "The Legend of
Zorro"), is a hero in the film.
He gives the church-going

"The Wolf of Wall Street") and

"Gone Girl" is the type of

film, but an experience - thanks
in part to masterful acting,
excellent direction and the eerie
score provided by Trent Reznor
and Atticus Ross. "Gone Girl" is
often emotional, darkly comic,
terrifying and always, always

Comeback effort thwarted

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
BIG RAPIDS, Mich. -
Conceding Iwo goals in the first
63 seconds of the season didn't
help erase the question marks
surrounding the Michigan
hockey team's defensive corps.
Turnovers and defensive laps-
es plagued the Wolverines during
Ferris State's three-goal barrage
in the first period. Despite out-
shooting the ninth-ranked Bull-
dogs, 27-22, in the final two
frames to mount a threatening
comeback, No. 8 Michigan suf-
fered a 4-3 defeat to open its
2014-15 campaign.
"I thought our team stayed
with it and we had a chance,"
said Michigan head coach Red
Berenson. "But goals are hard to
come by when you've given up
four goals against. Defensively,
we have to be better and we gave
them opportunistic goals."
Just 27 seconds into the
game, a giveaway in the neutral
zone and a poorly executed line
change led to Kyle Schempp's
breakaway tally past sophomore
netminder Zach Nagelvoort.
Soon after, woes in the defen-
sive zone started to pile on top of
each other.
With all five of Michigan's
players sucked deep into its own
zone, sophomore Chad McDon-
aid found himself wide open at
the point to rifle one home at the
1:03 mark of the first period to
give Ferris State (1-0-0) a comfy
two-goal cushion. The Bulldogs
would eventually extend their
lead to three before sophomore
forward Tyler Motte put Michi-
gan on the board 10 seconds into
the second period.
"Tyler, you know, wants to
play well in this situation and
he did play well," Berenson said.
"That was an important goal for
us and he got us going." "
Eventually facing a 4-2 deficit
in the final minutes of the game,
Michigan wouldn't sit down
without making a sell-out crowd
at Ewigleben Ice Arena visibly

Tyler Motte scored against his older brother, C.J., in Michigan's 4-3 losssto Ferris State in the season opener.

tense. Sophomore forward Evan
Allen helped put Ferris State on
the ropes after jamming home
a rebound with just under five
minutes to play, cutting the defi-
cit to one. Minutes later, the Wol-
verines earned apower play with
1:13 left on the clock.
Freshman forward Dylan
Larkin had a glorious chance
from the slot with under a half-
minute to play, in which he sent
a screaming shot toward the left
side netting. Michigan coach
Red Berenson thought it was in.
Motte thought it had a chance.
Both were left disappointed.
Ferris State's senior goalten-
der C.J. Motte, Tyler's brother,
lunged to his right, barely getting
a piece of the puck to send it sail-
ing toward the corner of the rink.
With that, Michigan's fate was
sealed.
Special teams weren't espe-
cially kind to the Wolverines
(0-1-0) all evening. They went
0-for-2 on the power play, and
the penalty-killing unit conceded
a late goal in the first period. On
the Bulldogs' first try with the
man-advantage, sophomore Ryan
Lowney sprung freshman Mitch
Maloney on a breakaway where
he executed a smooth finish past

Nagelvoort, who made 27 saves in
the loss.
The Holland, Mich. native
earned the starting nod in favor
of junior netminder Steve Racine.
Berenson has expressed firm
interest in both goaltenders shar-
ing time in net to begin the sea-
son.
"Nagelvoort finished up the
year last year," Berenson said. "I
thought he looked good. Lets face
it: he gave up a breakaway goal on
the first shot of the game. That's
not a good start to put your goalie
in.
"I thought he hung in there
and he gave us a chance."
But when Michigan could ill-
afford to concede another goal
- late in the second period, down
3-1 while on the power play - it
got beat on an odd-man rush in
which McDonald scored his sec-
ond of the game.
Yet, the Wolverines responded
quickly to start the third period.
Michigan's fourth line garnered
good chunks of offensive zone
time all night, and was awarded
for its effort 3:45 into the final
stanza. Junior forward Justin
Selman dished a backdoor pass
to senior forward Travis Lynch,
who hit twine to cut the deficit to

two goals.
"That was good, that was
really good," Berenson said. "We
can't be a one-line team, or two-
line team. Travis Lynch scored a
nice goal and that line was work-
ing hard all night so that's a good
sign for our team.".
Despite the loss, the ability to
mount a comeback in a hostile
environment remained one of
the brightspots for Berenson and
company. Additionally, fresh-
men that the Wolverines will
need to rely on this season - for-
ward Dexter Dancs, defenseman
Zach Werenski and Larkin - all
showed glimpses of promise.
"In the first game of the sea-
son, you like to see this resilien-
cy," said junior forward Andrew
Copp. "We didn't overcome the
adversity tonight, but we showed
up and we battled through it,
which is good to see."
Berenson, nor Copp, will
like how Michigan started the
season, but with a new season
comes a new learning curve. If
the second half of Saturday's loss
is any indication of this team's
mentality, bouncing back in
the midst of a demanding non-
conference schedule shouldn't
come as a surprise.

Wolverines earn chippy win

Michigan avenges
2013 Big Ten
Tournament loss,
beats Iowa
By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS
For the Daily
Atthe beginningof the second
half in its game against Iowa,
the Michigan women's soccer
team was facing a question of
identity: Would the Wolverines
be able to continue their recent
string of wins, or would this
game set them back to their
early-season inconsistency?
Michigan began the final
frame with urgency, peppering
the penalty area with pressure.
Early on, the ball fell to the feet
of freshman forward Taylor
Timko, who curled a wondrous
strike past the Iowa goalkeeper.
Just like that, the Wolverines
led the Hawkeyes, 3-2. The
question was answered.
The Wolverines (6-1 Big Ten,
10-3 overall) didn't let up for the
rest of the match, dominating
both the possession and the run
of play. Michigan even added a


fourth goal, treating the home
crowd to a gratifying 4-2 win.
The Wolverines' dominant
second half followed a first
frame that Iowa dictated,
thanks to a capable, swift
counterattack.
In the 21st minute, the
Hawkeyes earned a free kick.
Michigan was unable to clear
the ball out of the dangerous
area, and Iowa defender Melanie
Pickert was
there to reap -
the reward,
striking the "W e got

(4-3, 9-4) -
continued to
control the possession and
pace of the match, but the
Wolverines took a 2-1 lead in
the 41st minute when junior
forward Lulu Haidar crossed
the ball for sophomore forward
Nicky Waldeck to head home. It
was Waldeck's ninth goal of the
season - the second most goals

in the Big Ten.
The final moments of the
first half were more even, with
chances coming for both sides.
In the half's waning
moments, Iowa sophomore
midfielder Natalie Krygier
curled a marvelous shot from 18
yards out that tucked under the
crossbar, knotting the game at
two before intermission.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan

lose in Ann Arbor this season,
winning all nine of their home
contests, but have fallen three of
four times on the road. Ryan is

confident his team will perform
up to expectations away from
home.
"We just have to keep doing
what we're doing," Ryan said.
"As long as we're fresh, we're
going to be a good road team
as well. We're playing quality
soccer, and we just have to keep
getting better each week."
The frigid temperatures and
the raucous Hawkeyes' fans who
traveled to U-M Soccer Stadium
created an intense environment.
In the first matchup since No.
7 Iowa eliminated No. 2 seed
Michigan from the 2013 Big
Ten Tournament, the intensity
boiled over at times on the field.
Midway through the second
half, senior defender Jen Pace
had some harsh words for Iowa
forward Bri Toelle, who then
shoved Pace in the back. The
referee was quick to book Toelle
with a yellow card.
"We got in each other faces
a little bit in the heat of the
moment," Pace said. "Iowa's
always a physical team, so we
knew we had to come out and
match that physicality."
Ryan laughed when asked
about the altercation.
"I didn't even see it," he said.
"I thought (Toelle) was going to
have a stroke. It got chippy out
there today. I was glad our girls
fought back."

Run defense
lone highlight
in forgettable
Weekend
By GREG GARNO
ManagingSports Editor
The Michigan football team
continues to find itself on the
wrongside of history, this time
giving Rutgers its first Big Ten
win. The Wolverines walked off
battered as students stormed
the field.
After all that was in another
dreadful weekend, the Daily
looks at the good, the bad and
the ugly.

Albeit against a team
without its leading rusher, the
Wolverines once again held an
opponent under 100 yards on
the ground.
The Scarlet Knights finished
with 74 total rushing yards,
but only 49 of those came from
running backs.
Michigan's own rush attack,
meanwhile, quietly had an
impressive game, as it combined
for 158 yards and three
touchdowns.
Sophomore running back
Derrick Green led everyone with
74 yards while fifth-year senior
quarterback Devin Gardner
rushed for two touchdowns.
But there wasn't much beyond
rushing to brag about.

yards and no touchdowns. His
best pass may have been in the
third quarter, when he pump-
faked his own wide receivers
and threw right to Rutgers
defensive back Davon Jacobs.
The offensive line continued
to disappoint, breaking down in
pass protection to allow three
sacks. But its ability to move the
ball on the ground kept it from
being any worse.
And thetudents' choice to
rush the field at the end of the
game was a poor one. The Scarlet
Knights, with a4-1 record, were
favorites to win and had a better
record enteringthe game.
Forgive them, though, they
don't get these moments too
often.
The Ugly:
The Wolverines' defensive
line probably couldn't have
made it through part of the
crowd considering how they

played. It finished with
two sacks, but gave Rutgers
quarterback Gary Nova plenty
of time to set his field and find
an open receiver.
Of course, it was the
secondary'sporousperformance
that left receivers open for much
of the game. Senior cornerback
Blake Countess broke down in
coverage, junior safety Jarrod
Wilson wasn't up top to help out
and the experienced linebacking
corps couldn't contain easy
screen passes.
Perhaps Saturday's roughest
moment was the Daily football
beat's drive back home, which
left four writers sleeping on
one another's shoulders, two
photographers without an hour
of sleep and a carsick Editor in
Chief. It lasted more than 10
hours and cost more than $200
in gas.
Thank God for Taylor Swift's
music.
