MICHIGAN FOOTBALL
. What can be
done before
Ohio State

SPECIAL EP0RT: PATOLING CAMPUS POLICE
versight Cmte. may
be in violation of state law

MADISON -
A11 right - thank good-
ness that's over.
Now it's Michigan-
Ohio State week.
The Wolverines' second-
to-last game of the season has
always felt a little less important
than the others, knowing the
greatest week of the college
football
season --
is right
around the
corner. s,
It's not
hard to
sum up
Saturday's
debacle in COURTNEY
Madison, so RATKOWIAK
I'll do that
quickly.
After all, it sounds quite similar
to the other 14 losses I've cov-
ered over the past two years.
The back seven is so bad that
it doesn't give the offense a
chance. Tate Forcier maintained
after the game that he can't
blame the loss on the defense,
since it forced turnovers and
the offense couldn't capitalize.
Sorry, Tate, but you know two
defensive turnovers don't make
up for 45 points allowed.
But oh well - on to The
Game.
Last year, Buckeye Nation was
laughing at the 3-8 Wolverines
by the third quarter of the 42-7
blowout in Columbus. This year,
even with much more at stake -

bowl eligibility and credibility
- the thought of Michigan lin-
ing up against the Buckeyes on
Saturday is still just as cringe-
worthy as it was last November.
That's because at this point,
with (likely) just five days left in
the 2009 season, issues like the
talent level of the back seven are
unfixable.
But I still firmly believe Sat-
urday will prove to be Michigan
coach Rich Rodriguez's ultimate
test.
That's because in a game
where team chemistry means so
much, his ability to control the
controllable things this week
- off-the-field nonsense and
rivalry education - could very
well determine if the Wolverines
can keep it close on Saturday.
"You know, you want to ask
one thingl've learned?I've
learned that, probably being qui-
eter is being better. Coach Tressel
and I talked about that before the
game. Isaid, 'Tress, the quieterI
am, the less drama I have to deal
with."'
- Rodriguez, talking about
off-the-field issues after last
year's Ohio State game
But it seems like he hasn't
learned that - or, at least, he
can't make his players do the
same. For the second straight
year, the Wolverines are finding
themselves addressing off-the-

Concerns about
elections, meetings
and representation
abound for cmte.
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The Department of Public
Safety Oversight Committee was
created to hold the campus police
accountable.
But widespread negligence of

internal policies and of the state
laws from which those policies are
derived raises important questions
about how well the body is fulfill-
ing its role.
The Michigan state legislature
gave four-year public universities
the right to form their own cam-
pus police forces in 1990. The act
granted campus police the same
authority as state police but just
within universities' jurisdiction.
As a condition, the law required
each institution to create an over-
sight committee to act as a check
on their respective police depart-

ments - a committee that can
make recommendations for disci-
plinary actions against officers.
Section 390.1511 of the law, Pub-
lic Act 120 of 1990, also specified
that these committees must be
composed of two students, two fac-
ulty members and two staff mem-
bers, all "nominated and elected by
the faculty, students, and staff of
the institution."
At the University of Michigan,
the Department of Public Safety
was created in 1992 and the corre-
sponding DPS Oversight Commit-
tee was created the same year to

meet the requirements of this state
law. A governing set of bylaws was
also created to guide the commit-
tee's work and election procedures.
Since then, the DPS Over-
sight Committee's track record
has shown that in several crucial
respects it is neither meeting the
requirements of the state law nor
following its own procedures.
Potential problems exist in the
election of representatives from
each of the groups, the fulfillment
of the necessary student represen-
tation, the frequency of the com-

REFORM PASSED DOWN 0RO FATHER TO SON
For Dingell, health reform bill is
a legislative, familii lndmark

4* McGee is suing 'U,'
alleging wrongful
dismissal from
research post
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
and STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporters
A verdict is expected today in
the wrongful termination suit
being brought against the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents by a
former University graduate stu-
dent.
Robert McGee, 54, claims
he was fired from his job as a
research assistant for reporting
his supervisor's safety violations
in February 2008.
The jury will finish hear-
ing deliberations at 10 a.m. this
morning. A verdict is expected
later this afternoon.
McGee testified in the Washt-
enaw County Circuit Court last
Tuesday that on Feb. 16, 2008,
Michael Hartman, professor of
nuclear engineering and radio-
logical sciences, put him at risk of
exposure to a highly radioactive

isotope after Hartman ignored
access restrictions on a lab adja-
cent to his and entered without
proper safety equipment.
Shortly after the incident,
McGee sent an e-mail reporting
his possible radiation exposure
to the University's Radiation
Safety Service. He was fired the
next week.
McGee took the jury through
his day on Feb. 16, 2008, when
Hartman asked him to help
install a safety door in Nuclear
Engineering Prof. Kimberlee
Kearfott's laboratory on North
Campus. Kearfott's lab contains
a source of Cesium 137, a highly
radioactive isotope, which is
held in a machine. Only four
people have permission to be in
the vicinity of the material and
McGee and Hartman are not
among the four.
McGee testified thathe agreed
to go with Hartman because he
trusted him. McGee said when
he asked Hartman if he had
Kearfott's permission to enter
her lab, Hartman replied that he
did.
Once inside, the two discov-
ered they couldn't install the

Student paper faces harassment claims

CATCHING SOME AIR

A student newspaper at Fairfield
University that came under fire last
month after running a provoca-
tive column now faces harassment
claims from four students, accord-
ing to The Associated Press.
In the column, called "He Said:
The walk of shame," writer Chris
Surette advocates engaging in one-
night stands while characterizing
the women in such arrangements as
shameful. "Remember to be ruth-
less and have no shame," he wrote.
University administrators want
editors from the paper to stand
before a student conduct board. The
same board is reviewing the com-
plaints from the students who say
they "felt harassed and offended by
the column," according to the AP.
ACLU IMPLORES NEVADA
TO LET ACTIVISTS SPEAK

encouraging the school's president
to allow a controversial anti-illegal
immigration activist to be a panelist
in a forumscheduled for Nov. 19, the
Associated Press reports.
Some students and faculty at the
university have voiced opposition
to the panel's inclusion of Jim Gil-
christ, a co-founder of Minuteman
Project - a civilian border control
group - according to the Reno
Gazette-Journal.
Rebecca Gasca, public advocate
for the Nevada ACLU, told the Reno
Gazette-Journal that Gilchrist's
controversial opinions should not
interfere with his ability to speak at
a university, saying, "disagreement
can't be a justification for censorship,
especially in an educational forum."
TENNESSEE FOOTBALL
PLAYERS CHARGED WITH
ARMED ROBBERY

arrested Thursday and charged
with attempted armed robbery after
police say they approached aparked
car with a handgun and demanded
money, only to leave empty-handed
because none of the three victims
had money in their wallet, accord-
ing to the Associated Press.
The AP reported 'that Jan-
zen Jackson, Mike Edwards and
Nu'Keese Richardson, all 18, were
accompanied in the robbery by
Marie Montmarquet, 22.
According to the police report,
the victims showed their money-
less wallets to the robbers. The
victims correctly identified two
of the football players as the rob-
bers after police detained a vehi-
cle matching their description,
according to the AP.
First-year Tennessee football
coach Lane Kiffin refused to com-
ment on the situation until more
information surfaces, according to
USA Today.

NEWS BRIEFS
. DETROIT
Stimulus brings few
private-sector jobs
The federal stimulus funding
that has reached Michigan so far
has created few private-sector jobs
and some recipients of the cash
have overstated the number of jobs
created or protected, an analysis by
the Detroit Free Press shows.
The newspaper's examination
of the more than 1,800 awards to
agencies, departments, municipali-
ties and firms in Michigan under
the stimulus act found the biggest
impact was spurring or protecting
public-sector or summer jobs - not
private-sector jobs.
At first glance, the impact of the
federal stimulus act thus far looks
like good news for Michigan, which
in September had the nation's high-
est unemployment rate at 15.3 per-
cent.
Officials said that by Sept. 30,
some 22,500 jobs had been cre-
ated or saved in roughly the seven
months since Congress passed the
stimulus plan.
Michigan was promised $5.2 bil-
lion in stimulus money, $.2 billion
of which had arrived.
Close inspection reveals flaws
in the claims and raises doubts
about the mammoth spending bill's
impact to date. The Free Press'
analysis revealed that some stimu-
lus money recipients have greatly
overstated the number of jobs cre-
ated or protected.
PESHWAR, Pakistan
Militants attack two
anti-Taliban figures
Militants staged a pair of attacks
against anti-Taliban figures in
northwestern Pakistan yesterday,
killing one of the men as part of an
escalating campaign to weaken the
country's resolve to fight Islamic
extremism.
Suspected militants have killed
more than 300 civilians and secu-
rity personnel in the last month in
retaliation for an army offensive
launched in the tribal area of South
Waziristan, where al-Qaida and
Taliban leaders are believed to be
hiding.
The government has supple-
mented its military campaigns by
helping tribal leaders and local
government officials set up militias
to battle the Taliban. The militias,
known as lashkars, have been com-
pared to Iraq's Awakening Coun-
cils, which helped U.S. forces turn
the tide against al-Qaida there.
As in Iraq, militants in Pakistan
have targeted the leaders of such _
groups.

were killed on Sept. 11. If someone

The Michigan Public Service
Commission says Michigan resi-

The Flint Journal says the com-

ing costs will decline by as much as
16 percent compared with last year
due to a mild winter forecast and
adequate supply.
The panel says last winter was
4.8 percent colder than normal and
a return to normal temperatures
could reduce monthly heating bills
by tens of dollars.
The outlook for motorists

An aerial view of the maximum-security Thomson Correctional Facility in Thomson, III. on Saturday.
Oficials diOscuss plans to
relocate Git-mo inmates

Facility 150 miles
west of Chicago the
primary location
of interest
CHICAGO (AP) - Gov. Pat
Quinn and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin
yesterday tried to build support
and counter criticism of a proposal
to sell a prison in rural northwest-
ern Illinois to the federal govern-
ment to house Guantanamo Bay
detainees and other inmates.
Federal officials are expected to
visitthe maximumsecurity Thom-
son Correctional Center, about 150
miles west of Chicago, today.
Both Quinn and Durbin said
the possibility of selling the prison
to the federal government was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
help create about 3,000 jobs, both
at the prison and directly in sur-
rounding communities in an area
where unemployment has topped
10 percent.
"We have an opportunity to
bring thousands of good-paying
jobs to Illinois when we need them
the most," Durbin said at a news
conference in Chicago, one of sev-
eral Illinois stops yesterday. "We
have an opportunity to bring them
to a part of our state that has been
struggling and that's an opportu-
nity we are not going to miss."
Critics, including Republican
members of Congress from Illinois
and GOP candidates for governor,
have been quick to condemn the

prospect of the sale because of
safety concerns.
GOP gubernatorial candidate
Andy McKenna said Quinn's plan
to cut spending and create jobs
includes bringing "terrorists to
Illinois."
"I wholeheartedly oppose
Governor Quinn and President
Obama's efforts to move Gitmo
detainees to our neighborhoods,"
McKenna said in a statement.
The plan to consider using the
Thomson facility was first report-
ed by the Chicago Tribune.
Thomson has been largely
vacant since its construction in
2001 because of budget problems.
The prison was built with 1,600
cells, but only about 200 minimum
security inmates are held there.
Durbin brushed off security
concerns, saying convicted ter-
rorists are already incarcerated in
federal prisons without incident.
He said fewer than 100 of the
inmates at Thomson would be
Guantanamo Bay detainees if the
Federal Bureau of Prisons buys
the facility. Federal officials would
even erect a more secure perim-
eter around the prison to beef up
security, he added.
"We're here today to let the peo-
ple know we're not going to let the
fearmongers carry the day," Quinn
said. "We're going to do things
right, the Illinois way."
President Barack Obama's
administration wants to close
Guantanamo Bay, a military run
detention center in Cuba, and
move the detainees to the U.S.

so they can be prosecuted for their
suspected crimes.
The detainees are alleged ter-
rorism suspects who have been
held often without charges since
the beginning of the war in
Afghanistan.
Local and state officials will be
at Thomson today for an inspec-
tion by the Federal Bureau of Pris-
ons and Department of Defense
representatives.
U.S. Rep. Donald Manzullo,
a Republican whose district
includes Thomson Correctional
Center, was invited to today's
meeting with federal officials at
the prison but he did not plan to
attend, his spokesman Rich Carter
said Sunday.
Manzullo said he adamantly
opposes the proposal, despite the
jobs it would bring to the area.
Federal officials were consider-
ing Thomson along with a facility
in Florence, Colorado and a site in
Hardin, Montana.
Some 215 detainees remain at
Guantanamo Bay, and Durbin says
the administration has talked to
other countries about taking some
of them.
Durbin said he didn't know
when the Obama administration
would decide, but hoped Illi-
nois would have an advantage
because of Obama's connection
to the state.

In Shanghai, Obama
to hold talks with
local politicians today
SHANGHAI (AP) - President
Barack Obama is walking a tight-
rope on his first trip to China,
seeking to enlist help in tackling
urgent global problems while
weighing when and how - or if -
he should raise traditional human
rights concerns.
Obama arrived in Shanghai late
at night, in a driving rain, hustling
through a phalanx of umbrella-
holding dignitaries to reach his
limousine. Today, the president
is holding talks with local politi-
cians and, in one of the marquee
events of his weeklong Asian trip,
conducting an American-style
townhall discussionwith Chinese
university students.
Thirty years after the start of
diplomatic relations between the
two countries, the ties are grow-

The two nations are partnering
more than ever on battling global

that cause it: China has supported
sterner sanctions to halt North

but it still balks at getting more

China is a huge and lucrative

services, and yet it has a giant.
trade surplus with the U.S. that,
like a raft of other economic
issues, is a bone of contention
between the two governments.
The two militaries have increased
their contacts, but clashes still
happen and the U.S. remains wor-
ried about a dramatic buildup in
what is already the largest stand-
ing army in the world.
Amid all that, Obama has
adopted a pragmatic approach
that stresses the positive, some-
times earning °him criticism for

being too soft on Beijing, particu-
larly in the area of human rights
abuses and what the U.S. regards
as an undervalued Chinese cur-
rency that disadvantages U.S.
products.
Obama recognizes that a rising
China, as the world's third-largest
economy on the way to becoming
the second and the largest foreign
holder of U.S. debt, has shifted
the dynamic more toward one
of equals. For instance, Chinese
questions about how Washington
spending policies will affect the
already soaring U.S. deficit and the
safety of Chinese investments now
must be answered by Washington.
Second, Obama wants not to
anger Beijing, but to encourage it
to pair its growing economic and
political clout with greater lead-
ership in solving some of the most
urgent global problems, includ-
ing a sagging economy, warming
planet and the spread of danger-
ous weapons.
Obama has talked warmly
toward China, particularly in the
days leading up to his visit.
"The United States does not
seek to contain China," Obama
said in a speech from Tokyo on
Saturday. "On the contrary, the
rise of a strong, prosperous China
can be a source of strength for the
community of nations."
One test of the line Obama is
walking on China will be human
rights, including religious free-
dominthe officially atheistnation.
Aides said in advance that Obama
would raise several human rights
issues privately with Chinese
leaders, including President Hu
Jintao.
But it was unlikely he would
repeat those messages too stri-
dently in public, out of concern for
angering his hosts. Even before
arriving in China, for example,
he declined to get specific about
human rights concerns with
China in his Tokyo speech and
eschewed the traditional presi-
dential meeting with the Dalai
Lama while he was in Washing-
ton in June.

Abusing Bridge Cards

n these hard economic times, state legislators have had to
make tough choices on howe to save money. In many cases,
they have made mistakes like the decision tocut the Mich-
igan Promise Scholarship, which hurts thousands of students who
are trying to pay for college. But it's also important to acknowledge
the fact that some college students are hurting the state by unfairly
taking advantage of a welfare program called the Michigan Bridge
Card. This program is intended for people who are struggling to
make ends meet. The state should end the widespread fraud tak-

Last week, the University held
its first public forum to dis-
cuss implementation of the
campuswide smok-
ing ban. While not -
really answering
questions like,
"Whose idea was
the smoking ban?",
the University
clarified what will
happen to stu-
dents who violate
the ban. No tickets ROBERT
will be issued - SOAVE
instead, smokers
will be urged to
attend workshops
to curtail their offensive behavior. As
of July 2011, the University will be, in
the words of School of Public Health
Dean Ken Warner, quitting smoking
"cold turkey."
Why wait two years? The admin-
istration claims it wants to take this
time to gather input from students
and faculty. That, of course, makes
sense, since it didn't bother to inform
the Michigan Student Assembly or the
Senate Advisory Committee on Uni-
versity Affairs until the day before the
policy was announced last spring. But
I find myself wondering if the Univer-
sity set a date so far in the future in
order to minimize complaints from
students, most of whom will graduate
before being affected by the ban.
Whether intentional or not, this
tactic maybe working.I'veheard some
people who aren't thrilled with the
idea of a ban say that they don't care
too much because it won't ever affect
them. But regardless of how many stu-
dents this will impact, all members of
the campus community have an obli-
gation to voice their opposition to an
unfair policy that sets a dangerous
precedent against students' rights.
I'm not a smoker, and never have
been. But the ban isn't just a concern
for smokers. The issue at hand isn't
even public health. If it were, this issue

would already be settled, since out-
door smoking is neither widespread
nor particularly harmful to non-
smokers. While I can see the merits'
of banning smoking inside University
buildings (which is already in effect)
and preventing smoking directly out-
side building entrances and windows,
outdoor smoking only poses health
risks to the smokers themselves. The
University, then, isn't attempting to
improve public health - it's seeking to
regulate the health of individual peo-
ple, the smokers themselves.
Such a move raises troubling ques-
tions about how far the University will
go to regulate health on an individual
level. Can you imagine the University
putting limits on how many desserts
you can eat in residence halls? Requir-
ing you to visit the CCRB a couple
times a week? Measuring your waist
and forcing you to diet if you weigh in
at an unhealthy size?
I know some people hate this "slip-
pery slope" argument. But this isn't a
joke - take a look at Japan. According
to The New York Times, the Japanese
government passed a law last year that
required companies and local govern-
ments to pay fines for employing over-
weight people who fail to slim down.
Blatantly absurd policies like this one
don't appear on their own: They come
about after society has acclimated to
policies that are less absurd. And those
policies were preceded by ones that
were only slightly absurd. The "slip-
pery slope" exists.
Just as Japan's policy discourages
companies from hiring overweight
people, the University's smoking ban
will eventually turn away prospective
students who are smokers. That's a
shame, since smokers disproportion-
ately fall into lower income groups.
The ban broadcasts the message that
.these students aren't good enough
for the University unless they can
quit smoking. Dissuading such peo-
ple because their habit isn't favorably
regarded by the administration direct-

ly contradicts the role of an institution
of higher learning. Instead, the Uni-
versity should welcome students of
all different beliefs, backgrounds and
habits. Smokers should feel included
in a tolerant, freethinking campus,
without being ostracized or forced to
conform.
'U' can't regulate
health on an
individual level.
Even if you accept the University's
argument that it wants to bring down
health care costs, I questionhowmuch
money will be saved by banning an
activity that only about 14 percent of
employees and 16 percent of students
engage in. Keep in mind that smokers
won't be forced to quit, they just won't
be able to smoke on campus. So instead
of significantly reducing health care
costs, all this ban will do is further
inconvenience and alienate smokers.
The University is free to promote
public health all it wants by offering
programs to assist smokers who want
to make the choice to quit. It can hand
out pamphlets on the risks of smoking.
It can offer discounted smokingcessa-
tion products, as it plans to under the
ban. Buttheactivityitselfmustremain
a right of all students on campus.
I urge everyone to attend the next
forum, which will take place at 5 p.m.
on Nov. 19 in the Walgreen Center's
Stamps Auditorium on North Cam-
pus. Students and faculty must make
it clear to the administration we aren't
comfortable on a campus that tram-
ples the rights of individuals so easily.

mental affections
over some beefy

organized with the support of 350.org,
an international grassroots environ-
mental-action organization focused on
what is perhaps the greatest challenge
facing our generation - to sustain the
environment by keeping carbon diox-
ide levels in the atmosphere below 350
parts per million.
There are three important things
about the number 350. The first is that
peer-reviewed science says a planet
with more than 350 parts per million
carbon dioxide in its atmosphere isn't
compatible with the environment that
allowed life on Earth to evolve. To
cross that line for any extended period
of time will almost certainly pose a
serious threat to the survival and live-
lihoods of organisms across the planet,
including people. The second thing to
know iswe've already passed that: C02
levels are roughly 390 ppm. Third, get-
ting back to 350 ppm is going to be a
tremendous challenge that will require
dramatic economic changes to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
A lot of people count on the federal
government to confront the climate
change challenge. But we shouldn't
hold our breath waiting for the sort
of swift, decisive public policy deci-
sions that climate change demands.
Experts are pretty confident that even
the watered-down cap-and-trade bill
now being considered by Congress
won't pass this year (and it's already
years overdue). The sad political real-

ity - and one that may not change for
quite some time - is that there aren't
enough votes on Capitol Hill to get
strong greenhouse gas legislation onto
the president's desk. Any action the
federal government takes is likely to be
too little, too late. And any action state
governments take is, for the most part,
limited only to individual states.
Luckily, this doesn't mean our plan-
et is doomed, because strong federal
action isn't the only route back to 350.
Private-sector solutions and ordinary
people could also get us there. In fact,
they're already outpacing the federal
government.
Nonprofit organizations are one of
the focal points in this trend. Grass-
roots organizations like 350.org, the
Sierra Club and Greenpeace have
made headway by successfully promot-
ing both conservation and awareness
about the environmental impacts of
individual and group decisions. And
other nonprofits are taking fresh, effec-
tive and less obvious approaches to
environmental problems. For instance,
the environmental think tank World
Resources Institute is partnering with
business powerhouses like Goldman
Sachs to funnel investments into green
companies and turn clean technologies
into profitable opportunities.
Meanwhile, clean technology com-
panies are pushing the envelope by
advancing earth-friendly technolo-
gies and bringing them to the market.
Solar panels that were prohibitively
expensive a decade ago have become
increasingly cost-effective as technol-
ogy has advanced, and solar panel sales
have grown by more than 50 percent
annually in recent years. In a similar
vein, newborn "smart grid" compa-
nies are using IT and new devices to
help electricity producers generate
and distribute electricity more effi-
ciently, reducing their usage of dirty
fossil fuels. As technologies like these
become cheaper and more efficient,
they're likely to replace fossil fuels,
with or without a government man-
date.
Of course, reaching 350 requires
changes from most businesses, notjust

clean tech companies. Big companies
produce high greenhouse emissions in
everything from generating electricity
to making chemicals to producingcon-
sumer goods. But there's a silver lining
here, too. "Sustainability" has become
a common and oft-repeated buzzword
in leading firms and business schools,
and smart companies are cutting their
carbon emissions and marketing them-
selves as green companies. Google, for
instance, recently set a goal to go car-
bon neutral.
Private sector
solutions lead the 0
green revolution.
Consumer intervention can serve
as a substitute for government man-
dates, as conscious consumers use
their purchasing decisions to sup-
port green companies and apply pres-
sure to firms that waste and pollute.
New websites, like carrotmob.org,
are emerging to help environmentally
conscious consumers organize boy-
cotts of firms that aren't being friend-
ly to Mother Earth. And companies
that sell environmentally damaging
products may take a hit as competi-
tors' products are marketed and sold
as greener alternatives.
Global climate change screams
for government action, but until that
happens, students, people and private
organizations can't afford to wait.
The 350 goal is daunting, critically
important and will require a revolu-
tion in the ways people consume and
produce. And students at the heart of
cutting-edge environmental research,
and who are just beginning careers in
new industries, are likely to play a key
role in gettingthe planetbacktowhere
it should be.

"So you want two soft tacos, a crunch wrap and cinnamon twists?"

Three guitar heroes
share their love of
their instrument

not dead, then at

ated by new-age
fizzy emo bands Itmih
like Fall Out Boy
and Paramore. Get Loud
Now, don't mis- At the State
understand; it's
not that these Sony
bands aren't
talented. It's just that the idea of
rock music has been shifting a lot
in the last few decades, from the
three-chord paint-by-numbers
structure of the late '50s to the
falsetto-tinged pretty boys of
today.
And among the many musicians
who have lived in the in-between,
Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack
White stand out. Maybe not as the
best guitarists, necessarily (that
is a separate, immaterial debate),
* but as three guitarists who under-
stand the ways of the guitar. They

know how to bend the sound
around their environment, how to
fiddle with their amps to produce
crazy but not overloaded effects
and how to simply make their
instruments their own.
Putting these three masters in
a room together with their gui-
tars sounds more like an epic
jam session than a full-fledged
documentary film. And yet here
we are with "It Might Get Loud,"
the new movie that does exactly
that. Even though the film isn't
interested in revealing great, hid-
den truths about its subjects, it's
still an absurdly fascinating ride
through the past and present of
three crazy good musicians.
If nothing else, "Loud" most
closely resembles a 90-minute
free-form rock song. The film
cuts between the backstories of
White from the White Stripes and
the Raconteurs, The Edge from
U2 and Page from Led Zeppelin
as though telling different verses
with the same melody. It doesn't
go chronologically, and the film-
makers aren't trying to tell the
life stories of the three so much
as they're on the hunt for clues
as to what influences and experi-
ences make up a rocker. There's a
mixture of archival footage and

on-location shoots in which the
musicians tour their old stomping
grounds and point out which fur-
niture they would move to make
room for their instruments.
In between the three different
stories, we're treated to Page, The
Edge and White sitting on couch-
es inside a giant, cavernous sound
studio, talking about how awe-
some blues music is and teach-
ing each other their tricks. And
director Davis Guggenheim ("An
Inconvenient Truth") is smart
enough to know that he can show
five minutes of The Edge naming
chords as he teaches the others
"I Will Follow" and the audience
will still be hooked.
Out of the mountains of footage
that were probably shot for this
film, Guggenheim is able to latch
onto the images and sequences
that leave a lasting impression on
viewers. Like White playing blues
music with his young son, whom
he dresses in miniaturized ver-
sions of his own outfits much like
Ben Stiller's character in "The
Royal Tenenbaums." Or Page's
humongous record collection,
which stretches from floor to ceil-
ing along all the walls of a room
in his mansion. Or White again in

bine everyone's desire to play along
with same kick-ass tech. Could there
honetly be anything more enjoyable
than playing along with a full episode
of "Tie Price is Right?" To bid on every
show to play every pricing game, to
spin that lovely illuminated wheel -
oh,'twould be rapturous. And to play
"Lingo" and "Chain Reaction" against
those nincompoops they disguise as
contestants, even just on my com-
pute screen where only I would know,
woud be the greatest vindication
against GSN I could ever imagine.
'The LiveScience.com article
alsocites data from Nielsen Media
Research - for which I made my feel-
ingsquite clear a fortnight past - that
many people are also interacting with
other viewers online while watching
shows. This is called an "interactive
experience," though taking a shot of
your favorite mind-number every time
"Family Guy" pulls a cut-away gag or
referencesa previous episode seems
more interactive to me. But there are
plenty of TV shows using the Internet
as well. ESPN's "SportsNation" uses

online polling to the point of irritancy.
Maybe someday live online polling
could actually guide the course of a
television show as it airs. Multiple end-
ings are often filmed for movies and TV
shows alike - why not make a veritable
vote-your-own-adventure show? Sure,
it would be extremely time-consuming
to shoot, and a lotof footage would be
wasted, but it would also be, without
question, the bestthing to ever happen
to my TV screen. Ever.
The best thing, that is, before we
combine these two kinds of interactiv-
ity. The pinnacle of television and the
ideal future of new media (a vague
term to which this column should also
supposedly pertain) would be partici-
pating visibly via avatar in a television
broadcast ina way that can actually
change an outcome. Sure, racing in
NASCAR would be fun and gratify-
ing. And voting the outcome of a TV
show could be incredibly intriguing,
both seeing the show unfold and see-
ing how America tends to vote when
it comes to potential moral dilemmas.
But the ultimate enterprise would
be to combine the two, watching a
character you control yourself going
through one of many possible live-
action stories written by some of the

best TV writers in the business.
Some people would argue this
has already been done. Video games
follow generally this formula. Obvi-
ously, some distinctions between the
two exist, and more would have to
be made. In the new-media utopia
of interactive TV, you aren't able to
"lose." Also, there are no save points
or going back and trying again in
interactive TV - if you fuck up your
character's life, you have to deal
with it, because there's no rewind or
load button on interactive live TV. It
essentially becomes "Second Life,"
but with well-written plot twists,
pretty celebrities and a half-hour
time slot to stop you from pissing
away your life.
So that's probably way too ambi-
tious for right now, but hey, why not
put it out there? For now, let's start
kicking "Law & Order" cast members
in the crotch and throwing tomatoes
at the little tykes of "Secret Life of the
American Teenager." It may not be
able to alter world just yet, but dear
lord would it be satisfying.
Block's next column is a write-your-
own-adventure. To write it, e-mail

GET LOUD
From Page 5A
performance footage,
shredding through a ren-
dition of "Blue Veins" that
makes his fingers bleed
profusely over his guitar's
body.
Now, we could get into
nitpicky, personal things
with "Loud." We can admit
that it's annoying when a
picturesque shot of Times
Square, accompanied by a
voice-over from The Edge
gushing over how his first
visit to New York City was
"like the movies," is fol-
lowed almost immedi-
ately by grungy footage of
Detroit as White makes
a lot of ambiguous, may-
or-may-not-be-dismissive
statements about his old life
there. Detroit made White
who he is today, and the
city's influenced so many
other rock musicians over
the years that its subdued
appearance in this film is

an insult, especially when
compared to the elegant
treatments that London and
Dublin are given.
Yes, White's made it
very clear in other inter-
views that he still admires
Detroit. But whether he just
didn't want to talk about his
hometown here or the film-
makers had already decided
they were going to paint
Detroit as a music waste-
land, there's almost none of
that admiration on display
in the movie.
But ultimately, of course,
where they came from only
supplements the music that
they play. And "It Might
Get Loud" is unquestion-
ably about the music, from
the opening credits that
fetishize every possible
aspect of the guitar to the
end credits that scroll
over the guys' dirty, gut-
tural cover of The Band's
"The Weight." Come for
90 minutes of pure unfil-
tered guitar bliss, and leave
chanting, "Long live rock."

PIRATE
From Page 5A
silent midnight DJ who, at the baf-
flement of everyone else, attracts
scores and scores of women without
uttering a word.
It's the interaction of these kalei-
doscopic personalities that gives
"Pirate Radio" its engrossing driving
force. From the harmless jokes they
play on each other to the betrayals
that threaten to tear them apart, the
crew's experiences aboard the Radio
Rock are bittersweet, memorable
and ultimately triumphant. Charac-
ter development is such that it's easy
to instantly love or hate someone, but
at the same time, it's just as easy to
identify with everyone.
"Pirate Radio" is a magnificent
film that places the limelight on
men not normally accustomed to
it. But beneath the debauchery and
ridiculousness is a story of friend-
ship and steadfast resolution. Each
DJ is imperfect by himself (except
for maybe Mysterious Mark), but
together they make an unstoppable
team united under one cause: the
love of music.

8A - Monday, November 16, 2009

The Michigan Daily - michigandzily.com

Concerns abound for DPS Oversight Committee .

From Page 1A
mittee's meetings and the number
of grievances reviewed each year.
This catalog of systemic prob-
lems calls into question whether a
committee tasked with holding the
campus police accountable has ful-
filled that role and whether it even
can.
A LACK OF STUDENT
REPRESENTATION
Many of the most serious con-
cerns about the DPS Oversight
Committee rest with the two seats
devoted to students.
Sometimes vacant for months at
a time and arguably filled in a way
that violates the provisions of the
state law, the two student seats on
the committee have historically
been mishandled by the commit-
tee and by the Michigan Student
Assembly, which has been tasked
with filling the seats.
Since the committee's establish-
ment, a formal election involving all
students at the University has never
occurred, according to MSA Presi-
dent Abhishek Mahanti. Instead,
already-elected MSA representa-
tives are appointed to the commit-
tee based on an internal application
process and assembly-wide confir-
mation.
Stephen Hipkiss, chair of the DPS
Oversight Committee and facil-
ity manager at the Harlan Hatcher
Graduate Library, said this is war-
ranted because the student body
elects MSA representatives.
"The thought there is that they
are in fact elected," Hipkiss said.
"They're elected to MSA, and MSA
selects them from there."
When presented with the state
statute and a description of the Uni-
versity's current practices, inde-
pendent attorneys The Michigan
Daily spoke with disagreed with
this theory.
According to David Einstandig,
an attorney for Thav, Gross, Stein-
way & Bennett P.C. in Bingham
Farms, Mich., the practice of MSA
representatives electing the com-
mittee members doesn't comply
with the state statute.
"(The statute) doesn't say elected
by the 'student representatives,'
it says the 'students,"' Einstandig
said. "it appears that the law is not
being complied with. The statute
appears not to give the right to elect
to MSA. The right is given to the
student body. MSA is not the stu-
dent body."
Jonathan Jones, an attorney who
practices in Southfield, Mich., had a
similar stance. He said that state law
dictates that all students participate
in the election and that the appoint-
ment of representatives by MSA
denies students their right to vote.
"Unless it's placed in a formal bal-
lotwhere the entire student body has
an opportunity to nominate some-
one and/or vote for nominated can-
didates, then the students are being
deprived of the voice that the statute
gives them," Jones said.
Currently, student body-wide
elections for MSA happen twice a
year.
Einstandig said the University
could solve the student voting issue
by creating a similar process to
elect student representatives on the
DPS Oversight Committee.
Mahanti disagreed with the fea-
sibility of holding an election spe-
cifically for representatives to the
DPS Oversight Committee. If MSA
were to do this, he said, it would

also have to organize an election
for representatives serving on other
University committees and that the
election would not generate many
votes.
"We have enough problems as it
is getting voter turnout and enough
candidates to fill our slates," Mah-

field garbage this week. There's not
room for that in Ann Arbor, espe-
cially not now.
Former coach Lloyd Carr largely
refused to address those controver-
sies - he would just say the mat-
ter was being handled internally.
Carr's intimidating staredowns
with reporters and his refusal to
answer off-the-field questions
may have been frustrating for the
media, but it sure kept the focus on
the field.
Last year, during Ohio State
week, Rodriguez announced Zion
Babb and Jason Kates had left the
team. Artis Chambers broke the
news via Facebook that he was "no
longer a Wolverine," and it was
heavily rumored Sam McGuffie
was close behind. That kind of dis-
traction duringthe biggest week of
the season is ridiculous.
Even more disturbingly, it seems
like Rodriguez still hasn't learned
to control that.

Committee on University Affairs
and executive committees of the
College of Literature, Science and
the Arts, the College of Engineer-
ing, the Medical School and the
School of Education. Once elected,
each faculty committee member is
supposed to serve a two-year term.
However, according to a Uni-
versity response to a Freedom of
Information Act request on July 17
that was obtained by The Michigan
Daily, the last faculty member to
be elected to the committee was in
April 2000.
SACUA chair and Engineering
Prof. Michael Thouless admitted
in an e-mail interview that SACUA
has not held an election for the DPS
Oversight Committee since 2000.
"It appears that the DPS Over-
sight Committee simply fell off the
radar screen of SACUA, its previ-
ous chairs and the four college
executive committees that are also
charged with overseeing the nomi-
nation process," Thouless wrote.
He wrote that the terms of office
are not clearly stated in the pro-
cedures and that since the same
elected faculty members are. still
serving on the committee, "nothing
triggered another election or the
attention of SACUA."
Thouless first found out about
the election violations in May,
when he became chair of SACUA
and after he worked on an audit
of all the committees SACUA is
responsible for.
"When we found the current
procedures, I was concerned by the
fact that they are vague in places,
and the election rules are rather
cumbersome," he wrote. "(They) do
not clearly define terms of office and
do not make it clear how to ensure
all members of the UM community
get a voice in the elections."
Thouless wrote that he has been
communicating with the Univer-
sity's Human Resources Office to
rewrite some of the procedures in
order to solve some of the problems.
Tim Wood, senior director of
Human Resources, said his office
is mainly in charge of elections for
staff representatives on the com-
mittee, but that he didn't know why
there has not been an election for
faculty representatives since 2000.
"I don't know if it's a lack of inter-
est in people participating or they
just haven't done it," Wood said.
Thouless wrote that drafting a
new procedure may "take some time"
and that SACUA may hold an election
despite the unclear procedures.
"If it looks like the re-drafting
process is going to take too long,
and SACUA decides holding a new
election is more urgent than clean-
ing up the rules that govern the
DPS oversight committee, we may
decide that we need to try and
organize one using the existing, but
somewhat unsatisfactory proce-
dures," he wrote.
SELECTIVE STAFF VOTING
Some concerns - including legal
concerns - surround the process
by which staff members elect rep-
resentatives to the DPS Oversight
Committee. Though staff members
have been elected to the committee
on a regular basis, voting restric-
tions and low election participation
underscore how staff representa-
tion on the committee suffers from
flaws similar to those of the student
and faculty representation.
The DPS Oversight Committee
bylaws mandate that both union
and non-union staff members

nominate their peers. From there,
the University's Office of Human
Resources conducts staff elections
for one position each year - alter-
nating between union and non-
union groups.
The concerns arise, though, from
the fact that only members in each

group may vote for their respective
labor representative.
Jones said this election policy
also appears to violate the state
statute because different members
of the staff are excluded from exer-
cising their right to vote each year.
But Wood said the election pro-
cedure does not breach the law.
"I think we're confident that
it's appropriate that it's just a split
between the unionversus non-union
seat," Wood said. "Each employee
has the right to vote. It's just which
election they're voting in."
The last staff election was held
in June 2009 to elect a union repre-
sentative. While elections are con-
ducted in a timely manner, there
has been a great deal of variation in
voter participation during the last
few years.
The FOIA response from the Uni-
versity on July 17 reveals that there
were 84 votes in the 2009 election
for a union representative. How-
ever, in2008, there were 1,521 votes
for a non-union representative.
Hipkiss said he didn't know why
there was such a large difference in
the votes.
"The election for the (non-union)
position seems much more straight-
forward, and to my knowledge the
only one that is announced in the
University Record priorto the actu-
al soliciting of votes," he said.
Wood also did not know why there
was a disparity of more than 1,400
votes. He said one explanation may
be the difference in the amount ofeli-
gible voters. But numbers from a July
2009 Human Capital report show
thatthousandsofmorestaffmembers
could be voting in each election.
According to the report, the
University's Ann Arbor campus
employs 27,464 staff members.
About 6,982 staff members belong
to a union, and 20,482 do not belong
to a union.
These numbers demonstrate a
very low voter turnout. And though
the number of union and non-union
staff fluctuates from year-to-year,
there was similarly low turnout in
each election. For non-union staff
only 1,521 votes were cast in 2008
out of a potential voter pool similar
to the staff's current size of 20,482.
And for union staff, only 84 votes
were cast in 2009 out of a potential
voter pool similar to the staff's cur-
rent size of 6,982.
Though these numbers do not
violate the state law or the commit-
tee's bylaws, they raise concerns
about how aware staff members are
of the committee's existence and
how well the votingprocess reflects
the concerns of its constituents.
Fitzgerald admitted that the
University may need to look into
restructuring the election process
for students, faculty and staff.
"Maybe it's time to kind of look
at those established processes and
review whether they need some
updating or changing," he said.
SPORADIC MEETINGS
Compoundingthe problems with
elections and representation are
concerns about the body's everyday
functioning.
Infrequent meetings, an agenda
thinned out by DPS's internal com-
plaint processes and little aware-
ness of the body have limited the
DPS Oversight Committee's role as
a check on the campus police.
According to the committee's
bylaws, the DPS Oversight Com-
mittee must meet monthly unless
otherwise determined by the com-

mittee chair. Hipkiss said the com-
mittee meets "as needed" - when a
complaint is filed. He added that it's
not unusual for the committee to
meet only once a year.
"If there are no complaints filed
with us, there's not much more for
us to discuss," he said.

Chaness said that durirg his
time on the committee, he attended
one meeting per semester, which he
thought was sufficient.
"It's overkill if we're constantly
asking (DPS) for clarificatim on
things,"-he said. "As long as ve're
satisfied with what they're coing
then there really isn't any nee for
us to step on their feet and get in the
middle of their work."
Other than presenting infosma-
tion as requested, DPS spokeswom-
an Diane Brown said DPS doesnot
play a role in the decisions of the
committee.
"We're only requested to corte at
their request - whenever that is -
to discuss whatever it is that they
are asking for, and that changes all
the time," she said. "Not that they
meet all that often, but we are at
their bidding."
Most of the time, Chaness said
the committee heard complaints
from people who said they were
mistreated by a police officer at a
traffic stop or didn't like the way
they were treated while issued a
minor in possession.
But in the past, the committee
has received more delicate griev-
ances. After four years of inactiv-
ity, the committee received its first
grievances in 1996. One of those
grievances received in 196, came
after John Matlock, assitant vice
provost and director of tle Office of
Academic and Multicultral Initia-
tives, was arrested.
Matlock was chaged with
assaulting a DPS officert the Cen-
tral Campus Recreation Building,
where he was officiatirg a basket-
ball game sponsored b the Black
Volunteer Network - aUniversity
student group. Matlocli contended
that the officers treatd him in a
disrespectful manner because of
his race. The charges egainst Mat-
lock were eventually dopped.
Following the Matlck incident,
the committee looked nto why it
had not received morezrievances.
It found that DPS recived about
10 complaints each yer, none of
which were filed as griences with
the committee.
In a 1996 Investigatnn of Poli-
cies and Practices of Ie Depart-
ment of Public Safety ad Security
report, the DPS Oversigt Commit-
tee recommended that he Univer-
sity's Office of the Geneal Counsel
hire an attorney to advie the com-
mittee on legal issues ad that the
committee receive all omplaints
and grievances reported o DPS.
Though an attorney as never
been hired to provide dvice, the
director of DPS gives n annual
report of all complaints snt to the
oversight committee.
However, according ton Oct. 9
University response to aFreedom
of Information Act requesthat was
obtained by the Daily, IPS gave
no annual complaint or Frievance
reports for 2007 and 2008The last
known report was for 200
Hipkiss confirmed DPShas not
yet given a report for 2009.
He added, though, thatPS fields
about eight to 12 complains a year,
and the committee deals vith an
annual average of two gravances
each year.
He said the committeedoesn't
hear more grievances becase peo-
ple choose not to file them.
"Why they do that is a mtter of
speculation," he said.
Chaness said the grivances
brought to the committee se usu-
ally from people who drectly
contacted the committee trough

e-mail or by phone, with te rest
coming from DPS.
"Typically, DPS took are of
internal stuff, and we didn't lave to
get involved because we wee sat-
isfied with their investigatin and
what they came to the concusion
of," he said.

However, Hipkiss - who has
chaired the committee for the last
10 years - said late last month that
the committee had been waiting to
find out from MSA who the replace-
ments would be weeks before the
appointments occurred.
Chaness said student vacancies
on the committee don't cause a
problem unless a major complaint is
filed during the transition period.
"I hope that somebody on MSA
is getting word if there has been a
complaint or anything, and I hope
that they would ask for a student
representative before they took
further action," he said, "but unless
something comes up, it's not an
ing a coach who still laments about
all the "drama" instead of simply
refusing to address it, Michigan
also has a publicity-happy quarter-
back who is great at sending Wol-
verine Nation into a frenzy. There's
no reason for Forcier to text ESPN.
com's Pat Forde on Friday night to
say, "NO!", he's not transferring.
It's also not appropriate for him
to tell the world after Saturday's
game about the details of a dis-
agreement with his coaches.
It's supposed to be about "the
team, the team, the team," right?
Well, the Wolverines' freshman
quarterback definitely didn't sub-
scribe to that this week, and that
adds up to nothing but trouble for
a Michigan team that desperately
needs to focus. If Forcier really
wants to lead his seniors to a bowl
game, Rodriguez needs to manage
the Tate Forcier sideshow much
better than he has.
"I've been herefor one ofthem. So
that's the only one I can really com-
ment on, They've got one in a row on

MISSING FACULTY
ELECTIONS
Another key concern about the
DPS Oversight Committee's prac-
tices is the fact that the faculty seats
have not been filled by election in
nine years, which runs contrary to
the bylaws' procedures.
According to DPS Oversight
Committee's bylaws, faculty mem-
bers are supposed to vote for two
representatives from a pool of four
candidates. These candidates are
chosen by a nominating committee
of five faculty members appointed
by the chair of the Senate Advisory
us,from whatI've seen."
- Rodriguez, talking about
Michigan's five-game losing streak
after last year's Ohio State game
Rodriguez may continue to
ignore history, but he'll continue
to look ignorant. It doesn't matter
if he wasn't here for the first four
losses --he needs to stop discount-
ing the fact that the Wolverines
haven't won against the Buckeyes
since 2003. Taking the approach
that he has only "been there for
one of them" is the wrong way
to show his team how much this
game really matters.
After all, educating the team on
the importance of series history
has proven to be a difference-
maker - at the expense of the Wol-
verines. First-year Purdue coach
Danny Hope was seven years old
in 1966, the last time the Boiler-
makers had won in the Big House.
Even in a game that isn't a rivalry,
he forced his players to look at the
past.
"We came here today to make
history as a football team," Hope
said after his team's comeback win.
"What a great motivating factor for

a football team, to know we were
coming up here to Ann Arbor, to
the Big House, to make history."
Caring about games he didn't
coach in worked pretty well for
him, huh?
This is Rodriguez's chance to
prove he really gets the emotion of
the rivalry, something he couldn't
have possibly understood before
last year's game. Saturday will be
about re-invigorating a matchup
that has fallen flat in recent years.
It's about making sure the seniors
aren't the third straight class to
leave without a win against Ohio
State. And, yes, it's about showing
that Rodriguez's Wolverines can
add a valuable chapter to the big-
gest rivalry in sports.
"I think everybody understands
the importance of this game,"
quarterbacks coach Rod Smith
said. "We're not idiots. We know
exactly what's at stake and who
we're playing. We understand."
For the sake of the team, I hope
that's truer than last year.

Police looking
for suspect in
Friday's parking
structure assault

Official says two
men approached
man who was
urinating in lot
By MATT AARONSON
Daily News Editor
Ann Arbor police are looking
for two suspects in connection
to an alleged assault in a Forest
Street parkingstructure early Fri-
day morning that left a 20-year-
old University of Michigan student
hospitalized with a broken jaw.
Detective Dave Monroe said the
victim, who was alone at the time
of the alleged assault, told police
he was urinating in the parking
structure at about 2:30 a.m. Friday
morning,whenhewasapproached
by two men. The victim told police
that the men were angered by
his urinating, and that they con-
fronted him about it, according to
Monroe.

Monroe said that, according to
the victim, one of the men then
assaulted the victim before leav-
ing the parking structure with the
other man.
The man who allegedly assault-
ed the student, described by Mon-
roe as a 5'9" to 510", 175 to 180
lbs. white male in his early twen-
ties wearing a white t-shirt and
jeans, may have mentioned being
a United States Marine or being
affiliated with the Marine Corps
during the course of the alterca-
tion, Monroe said.
Monroe described the other
man as a 5'6" to 5'7",145 to 150 lbs.
white male in his early twenties
wearing a dark collared shirt at
the time of the incident.
Monroe said the two unidenti-
fied men may be connected to a
"red-colored pickup or SUV."

Department at (734) 794-6911 or

ARIEL BOND/Daily
Rep. John Dingell speaks at the Ann Arbor Community Center on Thursday. In an interview that day, Dingell discussed the passage of landmark health care reform legislation.

and pay for health care, Dingell
said,byprovidingsubsidies forlow-
income individuals and lowering
health insurance costs for business-
es. The thought is that this would in
turn make industries in Michigan
more competitive.
For Michigan citizens living in
the 15th congressional district,
the new legislation would provide
34,000 uninsured individuals with
health coverage, provide 160,000
families with health coverage cred-
its and prevent 1,800 families from
going bankrupt by insuring protec-
tion for health care costs, according
to the Committee on Energy and
Commerce's website.
Businesses with more than a
$500,000 payrollwill berequired to
cover all of their employees' health
insurance. But if a business choos-
es not to, Dingell said, it would be

door. Though they didn't have
radiation protection devices like a
survey meter or dosimeter, Hart-
man continued to walk further into
the lab.
Hartman then turned to McGee
and asked him if the machine that
contained the Cesium 137 was on or
off, McGee testified.
McGee said he thought Hartman
knew what he was doing, and when
he proved he didn't know if they
were protected from radiation,
McGee said he immediately left.
McGee said he then went home
and called Joseph Miklos, an Occu-
pational Safety and Environmental
Health coordinator for the Uni-
versity, to find out if he had been
exposed to radiation.
In his testimony last Thursday,
Miklos said he told McGee that he
couldn't have been exposed to radi-
ation because the Cesium had been
inactive since December.
However, McGee said in his tes-
timony that Miklos told him at the
time that he didn't know for sure
and that Kearfott would have a bet-
ter answer.
McGee contacted Kearfott, who
became upset upon hearing that
McGee and Hartman entered her
lab without permission, contrary to
what Hartman told McGee.
The two then met at Kearfott's
lab to check on the machine and

penalized with a graduated tax of
up to 2.5 percent.
Changes to business tax poli-
cies in the legislation will allow
for improved coverage for 488,000
residents in the 15th congressional
districtwho rely on employer-based
health insurance and provide tax
credits to 11,600 small businesses in
the district, according to the com-
mittee's website.
Opponents of the new legisla-
tion say the bill is too repressive in
requiring individuals to purchase
health care and small businesses
to provide health care for their
employees or face penalties.
In response to these arguments,
Dingell said the health care system
must be reformed to address the
health care needs of the 40 mil-
lion Americans who have no health
care. Because the legislation would
provide a variety of options for
individuals and businesses, Ding-
ell said people will have the choice
between continuing their current

health care plan or to decide which
new health care option best suits
their needs.
"We cannot afford the current
system and have to make signifi-
cant changes," Dingell said.
The legislation also includes
the recently added Stupak amend-
ment that prevents insurance plans,
including private plans paid for
through government subsidies, to
pay for abortions.
For opponents of abortion, the
amendment's inclusion in the
legislation was seen as a big vic-
tory for the pro-life cause. But for
those in favor of a woman's right to
choose, the amendment was seen
as a big step back, or as "the great-
est restriction of a woman's right to
choose to pass in our careers," as
Rep. Diana DeGette, (D-Colorado)
told The New York Times.
Dingell, anoted supporter of the
pro-choice community, said that
the amendment goes too far.
"Originally we had tried in the

drafting of the bill to see to it that
the bill was absolutely neutral and
that nothing change per federal
law with regard to abortion," he
said. "The Stupak amendment goes
further than that and says that
now private policies offered on the
exchange will not, or cannot offer
abortion."
The health care bill now faces a
tougher test in the Senate, where
the Democrats hold a smaller
majority.
Dingellsaidhe can'tpredictwhat
the Senate will do with the bill but
said he is hopeful the Senate will
move the bill forward soon.
"As we go through and see how
the due legislation works, if we're
able to get it to the president, which
I contend that we shall, how it
works so that we can then figure out
what will be the next steps in terms
of seeing to it that every American
has health care and that health
care is no longer a privilege and has
become right," Dingell said.

Kearfott found that it was off,
McGee testified.
In her testimony last Thursday,
Kearfott said the safety system pro-
tecting the source was not working
correctly prior to when the two men
entered the lab, but claimed this
would have made it more difficult for
the men to be exposed to radiation.
McGee claimed he was termi-
nated for reporting Hartman's
safety violations to Radiation Safe-
ty Service.
In his testimony Friday, Hart-
man said he wanted to dismiss
McGee weeks before the incident
because he was not fulfilling his job
responsibilities.
Hartman testified that the timing
of McGee's termination was coinci-
dental and that it did not have to do
with the incident in Kearfott's lab.
McGee started working for
Hartman in July 2007, when Hart-
man became director of the Neu-
tron Science Lab.
McGee's job was to finish the
safety systems and shielding for a
neutron generator in the lab. Hart-
man testified that McGee agreed to
have the projects completed by fall
2007,butthathe endedup finishing
the shielding in September 2007.
On Dec. 4 Hartman said he
e-mailed McGee a number of jobs
he wanted to be completed by the
end of the year, in addition to the
completion of the safety system.
Over the next two months, Hart-
man said McGee had only finished
four of the tasks on the list.

Hartman testified that he con-
tacted William Martin, chair of the
Nuclear Engineering and Radio-
logical Sciences department, about
terminating McGee at the end of
the semester.
However,.Hartman said Martin
encouraged him to keep McGee and
proposed that the department pay
for McGee's winter 2008 salary.
Hartman complied with Mar-
tin's request, but told McGee he
wanted the safety system com-
pleted by Feb. 1.
According to Hartman, McGee
constantly missed deadlines and
didn't show up to work.
In his testimony, McGee said
he had a-good relationship with
Hartman until the safety vio-
lations occurred. He cited- an
instance in January in which his
friend passed away and that Hart-
man had been very sympathetic -
letting him take time off to attend
the funeral.
But, McGee said, Hartman's
friendly demeanor changed after
the incident. He said Hartman
didn't speak to him at work.
OnFeb.19 Hartmansent McGee
an e-mail that included targeted
dates for McGee to complete his
assignments. Hartman also asked
McGee to call him to talk about
the schedule.
After McGee did not respond,
Hartman sent him an e-mail on
Feb. 20 informing McGee of his
dismissal, but said he would be
paid for the rest of the semester.

The seven-member jury was dis-
missed Friday evening after nine
and a half hours of testimony. The
trial was scheduled to resume this
morning at 10 a.m, and the jury is
expected to reach a verdict this
afternoon.

Sophomore Darryl Stonum is flipped during a kickoff return in Michigan's 45-24 loss to No. 20 Wisconsin. The Wolverines now need to beat rival Ohio State next weekend in order to qualify for a bowl game.
Blue's defensive woes |o Even after shaky week,
continue in blowout |Forcier has big game

By ANDY REID
DailySportsEditor
MADISON - With about two
minutes left in the Michigan foot-
ball team's 45-24 blowout loss to
No. 20 Wisconsin, the raucous,
"Jump Around"-crazed Badger stu-
dent section started to chant, "Let's
get wasted."
For different reasons - namely,
to drown their sorrows and forget
about the game - Michigan fans
surely were thinking the same
thing. For the fourth straight week,
the Wolverines were blown out,
showed serious flaws on the defen-
sive side of the ball and inched
closer to clinching their second
consecutive bow-less season,
which hasn't happened since 1974.
But most frustrating of all,

for the fourth straight week, the
game's storyline was exactly the
same: keep up for two quarters,
built some offensive momentum
and then completely shut down
after halftime.
The Badgers racked up 469 total
yards, and quarterback Scott Tol-
zien became the sixth person ever
to throw four touchdown passes in
a game against Michigan.
Defensive coordinator Greg Rob-
inson, who declined to speak with
the media for the second straight
week, decided to switch up his
scheme a little bit this week.
"We were really, defensively,
really reaching to find an answer
and to try tostop people," Michigan
coach Rich Rodriguez said.
Redshirt sophomore Brandon
Smith started instead of safety

Mike Williams. But he cheated up
to the line of scrimmage all game,
which left walk-on safety Jordan
Kovacs as the last line of defense.
More surprisingly, junior Dono-
van Warren, one of the best cover
corners in the Big Ten, logged some
time at safety. He drifted back
while J.T. Floyd and Troy Woolfolk
covered the Wisconsin receivers.
"I actually have no idea," middle
linebacker Obi Ezeh said of War-
ren's switch. "Monday we just kind
of go out, and they tell us where to
line up and that's how we practice."
But before the break, Michigan
(1-6 Big Ten, 5-6 overall) hung with
the Badgers and was actually beat-
ing them at their own game. The
Wolverines held the ball for more
than 20 minutes in the first half,

Daily Sports Editor
MADISON - Tate Forcier's
freshman campaign peaked nine
weeks ago.
The quarterback completed
nearly 70 percent of his passes for
240 yards and two touchdowns
against then-No. 18 Notre Dame as
he led Michigan to a come-from-
behind win.
From there, Forcier's play slow-
ly declined from very good to very
freshman. The late-game heroics
ran out, the losses piled up and
Forcier threw just as many inter-
ceptions as touchdowns in the
next seven games.
But this past Saturday was
statistically his best game since
the Fighting Irish visited the Big
House.
Forcier completed 20 passes for

just the second time this season
at an outstanding 77-percent clip.
Though there wasn't any reason to
bask in the 188-yard, two-touch-
down performance after Wiscon-
sin's dominating 21-point victory,
Forcier's game seemed to take its
first uptick in quite some time.
"Tate made some very good
decisions on some plays," offen-
sive coordinator Calvin Magee
said after the game. "The progress
is going with Tate, and we see dif-
ferent things every week that he's
picking up."
Wisconsin defensive back Niles
Brinkley wasn't short with the
praise, either.
"He's a very good quarterback,"
Brinkley said. "We've seen a lot
of good quarterbacks this year
against the spread offenses, and I
feel like he's one of the top quar-
terbacks in the conference and he

will be inthe future."
But just two days before the
game, it looked like Forcier
wouldn't be the one running the
offense againstthe Badgers. Forci-
er missed a study table session
earlier in the week, and the coach-
ing staff was unaware that he was
making the time up in another
way.
Once the situation was cleared
up, Forcier made his 11th start of
the season over freshman Denard
Robinson. Robinson ended up get-
ting just 10 touches, half rushes
and half passes, most of which
came in the game's waning min-
utes.
"Denard, he took a lot of reps
throughout the week - I actually
expected him to start," Forcier
said about Robinson. "But Coach
Rod threw me out there and I

Michigan State
sweeps Icers as 'O'
continues struggling

Harris posts triple-double in victory

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - As Michigan
hockey fans took their seats in Yost
Ice Arena on Friday, they figured
a home win over rival Michigan
State would speed up the Wolver-
ines' slow start this season. After
all, Michigan had beaten the Spar-
tans six straight times.
Instead, a 3-2 loss, followed by
a 2-0 defeat at Munn Ice Arena on
Saturday, only added to the early-
season doldrums. Michigan has
now lost four straight games.
"The only barometer we have is
the games," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "I would've told
you that we would have been bet-
ter this weekend. Were we in some
areas? Yeah. But as far as the whole
package, good enough to win, good
enough to beat a top 10 team - no."
Michigan's losses overshadowed
the return of Spartan forward
Corey Tropp to Yost Ice Arena after
0 his on-ice assault last season on

senior defenseman Steve Kampfer
earned Tropp a suspension for the
rest of the year. Last season, Kamp-
fer was knocked down on a cheap
shot late in the game, and Tropp
came and slashed Kampfer in the
head region while the defenseman
was motionless on the ice.
While the Children of Yost
booed Tropp everytime hetouched
the puck, it didn't stop the CCHA's
third-leading scorer from beating
Kampfer one-on-one with a toe-
drag and a wrist shot over junior
goaltender Bryan Hogan's shoul-
der. The goal was the Spartans'
second of the night.
"At Michigan, that's a really
tough situation for a young kid
to handle," Michigan State coach
Rick Comley said. "I thought
their crowd was fine, though. ... I
thought both teams kind of let it go,
and it was a non-incident."
Perhaps the crowd should have
saved its boos for the Wolverine
power play. The unit failed to score

A triple-double is arguably the
rarest of feats for a Michigan bas-
ketball player.
For 22 years, Gary Grant was
the founder, president and lone
member of the club.
Make room for Manny Harris.
During Saturday's season-
opening 97-50 win over Northern
Michigan, amid questions about
his health and conditioning level
due to a lingering hamstring inju-
ry, Harris made history.
With 8:52 left in the game and
Michigan dominating the game,
the junior small forward passed
the ball to freshman guard Matt
Vogrich, who then drained his
fourth 3-pointer of the night. It
was a basic play and a nice shot,
but the pass was the special part.
It was Harris' 10th assist,
which earned him just the sec-
ond triple-double in program his-
tory - and made Harris the first
Michigan player to do it in Crisler

Harris wasn't even alive on
March 14, 1987, the night Grant
recorded Michigan's first triple-
double. Still, the junior knew
what was at stake. When the

Wolverines' coaching staff told
Harris just three assists stood
between him and the milestone
partway through the second half,
he relaxed. He knew he had plen-
ty of time to dish out a few crisp
passes. Less than three minutes
later, the achievement became
history.
"The game has just slowed
down so much (for Harris),"
Michigan coach John Beilein
said. "He trusts these shoot-
ers, and he relishes the assists as
much as he does the points."
Harris' 18 points, 13 rebounds
and 10 assists certainly jump off
the page, but perhaps the most
important stat of the game was
Michigan's 57.4-percent field goal
percentage.
"Actually, anybody can get 10
assists, because we shoot the ball
so well," Harris said.
Harris has a good point - four
of the Wolverines' five starters
tallied at least two assists, and
every player who played signifi-
cant time scored at least a bucket
or two.

in either game this weekend. After
starting the season 4-for-8 with
the extra-man advantage, it has
scored just three goals on its last
49 chances.
Trailing 2-0, Michigan had
four-and-a-half minutes with the
man advantage in Saturday's third
period. The Wolverines worked
the puck around the perimeter
and kept the pressure going in the
offensive zone, something they
failed to do in other power plays,
but Michigan State shut down the
middle and cleared the rebounds
with the man advantage. Of
those potentially game-changing
chances, the Wolverines gener-
ated just two shots.
"It's just execution," Kampfer
said. "Coach (Berenson) has given
us a very simple plan to go out
there with. ... I think we need to
get shots through and start crash-
ing the net."
The power play is just a small
part of Michigan's early-season

offensive woes. The Wolverines'
goals on the weekend came from
junior Carl Hagelin, one of the
few players consistently scoring
points, and freshman defenseman
Lee Moffie, who has been in and
out of the lineup.
Despite facing 31 shots Satur-
day, Spartan goaltender Drew
Palmisano was rarely forced to
make anything more than a rou-
tine save in his second career shut-
out. A little bit of bad luck and alot
of missed chances have resulted in
just four Michigan goals in its last
four games.
While the Wolverines have a
chance to find their scoring touch
next weekend in a home-and-
home against Bowling Green, the
conference's second-worst defen-
sive team, the series could end up
being a lot more complicated.
"We're not that good," Beren-
son said. "We've got one returning
20-goal scorer, and he's got one
goal, and outside of that, every-
body else - they're doing what
they can, but we don't have alot of
prolific offensive players."

and the Wolverines didn't let up as
the game went on.
They were clicking on fast
breaks. They were trapping oppo-
nents on defense. And even the
freshmen looked comfortable
doing it. -
Some very impressive individ-
ual achievements were overshad-
owedby Harris' triple-double, too.
Vogrich, in his college basketball
debut, went 5-for-5 from beyond
the arc. And while reporters con-
tinuously asked questions about
Harris, Beilein made sure to point
out another player in the post-
game press conference.
"Look right next to (Harris')
name," he said.
Next on the box score was
senior forward DeShawn Sims, of
course. Sims recorded a double-
double, which included a game-
high 22 points.
Sims, along with Harris, came
out of halftime on fire. He quickly
scored a layup, and Harris drilled
an easy 3-pointer. After that, the
two created fast break opportuni-

ties and dunks as if they were put-
ting on a skills clinic.
And the scariest part for Michi-
gan's future opponents might not
be the multitude of points from
the potent duo. It could be their
defense, which was highlighted by
16 combined defensive rebounds.
Harris in particular impressed
fans with his hustle while fighting
for the ball, especially considering
his health concerns coming into
the game.
"I just want to be an all-around
player and crash the boards," Har-
ris said. "That's my mindset - just
attack, and try to get rebounds."
If Harris continues to concen-
trate on rebounding and tallying
assists, he could grow into an even
more dangerous, multi-faceted
player this season. Throw in a
quicker and stronger Sims, and,
well, there's a reason the pair has
been garnering a great deal of
attention.
"If Manny and (Sims) play
like they did (Saturday), shar-
ing the ball, getting rebounds,
doing all the little things, it's
going to be a great year for us,"
Vogrich said.:"We're going to be
hard to beat."

MADISON -
This is one of the all-time
worst stretches in the
history of the Michigan
defense.
Since padding the stats against
Delaware State,
the Wolverines
have given up
more than 1,800
yards and 156
points in four
games. As a
frame of refer-
ence, it took 11 ANDY
and a half games REID
for Michigan to
surrender that
many points in 2006.
Two quarterbacks - Penn State's
Daryll Clark and Wisconsin's Scott
Tolzien - have each thrown four
touchdown passes during that skid.
Before this season, just four quar-
terbacks had ever reached that feat
against the Wolverines. Even the
much-maligned 2008 defense isn't
on that list.
And even though Brandon Gra-
ham called Michigan a second-half
team after the Iowa game, the Wol-

verines have been outscored 99-19
after the break in the past four
games.
The Michigan defense is bad.
Understatement. The Wolverines
have given up 309 points this sea-
son, four more than at this point
last season, which was the worst
statistical defense in the history of
Michigan football.
But that's not what this column
is about. It's not hard to point out
that the unit is bad. What I want to
know is who is being held account-
able.
Rich Rodriguez will answer
questions about the defense in his
press conferences, but the head
coach is notoriously hands-off with
the defense, focusing instead on the
other side of the ball.
His defensive staff should be
answering some of the questions.
Where are the halftime adjust-
ments? What was going on with
switching Donovan Warren to
safety? How did Wisconsin "keep
getting stuff behind us," as middle
linebacker Obi Ezeh said?
But they won't even give report-
ers the time of day.

Greg Robinson has talked to the
media once in the last four weeks.
That one time, he was briskly walk-
ing toward Schembechler Hall as
myself and another reporter tried
to keep up and ask him a few ques-
tions.
After the Wolverines were torn
up for 500 yards against Purdue?
"Not today," Robinson said to
reporters. His defensive line coach
Bruce Tall also declined comment.
What about this week?
Linebackers coach Jay Hopson
told reporters he didn't want to talk
and then said, "Greg will handle
that." Robinson exited the locker
room five minutes later. He said
no, looked back and said, "You guys
- tomorrow. I'll talk to you tomor-
row."
There has never been media
availability on a Sunday, and Rob-
inson has never come to a midweek
press conference.
Last season, I almost felt bad
for Scott Shafer. Every week, the
defense looked inept. Every week,
Michigan gave up big play after big
play. But every week, as it became
more obvious that Shafer wasn't fit-

ting in and was probably going to be
let go at season's end, the defensive
coordinator still forced a smile on
his face, asked reporters how they
were doing and let them grill him
for a few minutes.
Robinson should be more than
comfortable with fielding tough
questions. He had to have gotten
his fair share of them while he was
the head coach at Syracuse, when
his teams went a combined 10-37.
As the defensive coordinator
of the Michigan Wolverines, you
should be willing to answer ques-
tions about your unit - even when
you give up 45 points and the ques-
tions will undoubtedly be negative.
Robinson should feel compelled
to at least give an update about
the defense every once in a while,
even if it's for nothing else than
the 100,000 people packing the
stadium every Saturday, for one of
the most loyal fanbases in college
sports.
I'm not asking for much. Just
answer a few questions.

Disappointing 10th-place finish
ends Michigan's postseason hopes

By MICHAEL LAURILA
For the Daily
BLOOMINGTON- The Michigan
men's cross country team couldn't
outrun illness and injury in the
Great Lakes Regional meet on Sat-
urday.
The team's 10th place finish
proved to be a disappointing step
back from last season's second-
place triumph.
Fifth-year senior Sean McNa-
mara, who tied for 10th in last
year's regional meet, strained his
Achilles tendon with 1,000 yards
to go Saturday, causing him to lose
about SO places.
Sophomore Bobby Aprill, who
placed 84th at last year's meet,
couldn't run due to illness.
Freshman Dallas Bowden, who
was slotted to run, did not com-

pete for undisclosed reasons.
Even though the Wolverines
facedeproblems outside of their
control, Michigan coach Ron
Warhurst wasn't going to blame
his team's mediocre performance
solely on that. After 35 seasons
as head coach, Warhurst knows
that every team faces these same
issues.
"We've been pretty affected by
illnesses and stuff," Warhurst said.
"Everybody is going through it. We
just didn't run well. Period."
Coming into the meet, Michi-
gan was hoping to qualify for
the NCAA Championships for
the second straight year. The top
two teams at the regional receive
an automatic bid into the NCAA
meet, and 13 other teams receive
an at-large bid.
With the Wolverines' 10th-place

finish, they were nowhere near
qualifying.
"We ended up 10th, and you're
thinking coming into it that you
can get second or third," Warhurst
said. "It was very disappointing."
Leading the way for Michigan
was redshirt junior Peter Christ-
mas in 29th place. Following close
behind him were freshman Bren-
don Blacklaws, finishing 31st, and
fifth-year senior Brandon Fel-
lows, finishing 33rd. The race is a
10-kilometer run, or approximate-
ly six miles.
"I did great up until about 7K,"
Christmas said. "About everybody
on our team just had a bad day.
Personally, I just had a cramp in
my lung.
"Not really anything I can do
about that."
Christmas knows the Wolver-

ines had an outside chance to make
it to the NCAA Championshipmand
didn't perform to their maximum
potential.
"I would say it was a mediocre
race for me at best," Christmas
said. "I didn't have a horrible day,
but I didn't have a great day, just
not a good one."
With this meet, the team is done
for the year.
Warhurst wasn't very pleased
with the team's performance
throughout the season, but he
knows it can bounce back. The
Wolverines had plenty of talent,
but just couldn't tie it all together.
"I just don't think we performed
well in a lot of situations, at least
up to their capabilities," Warhurst
said.
"We'll have to reevaluate and
find out what the deal is."

Blue qualifies for NCAAs with at-large bid

Peale leads
Wolverines to
third-place finish at
Regionals
By CAITLIN SMITH
For theDaily
BLOOMINGTON - Thanks to a
strong performance at the Great
Lakes Regional Tournament and
some at-large points accumulated
throughout the season, the Michi-
gan women's cross country team
will advance to the NCAA Cham-
pionships.

This weekend's regional meet
provided the ultimate spectator
sport. Family, friends and fans
raced up hills and through fields
of waist-high grass to follow the
stampede of runners as they took
on the 6,000-meter course.
The Wolverines came in third
place (104 points) at the meet, and
were just two points shy of auto-
matically qualifying for Nationals.
Notre Dame and Ohio State took
first and second place, respective-
ly. Redshirt sophomore Kaitlyn
Peale led the Wolverines with a
second-place finish overall (20:51),
which means she will automati-
cally advance as an individual to
Nationals.

The race began with a lot of
pushing for a good position, but
Notre Dame runner Lindsey Fer-
guson forged a large lead early
on. Peale kept her initial pace and
stayed close behind in the chase
pack.
"I could tell (Ferguson) was
fading the last 2K or so, and
(Michigan coach Mike McGuire)
kept telling me that I could catch
her," Peale said. "So, I just kept on
my pace and stayed with Emily
MacLeod from Michigan State.
Once you catch someone at the
end, it is a big mental boost. So I
knew once I had that, I would fin-
ish strong."
Peale made her move and fin-

ished strong, just nine seconds
behind MacLeod. Although Peale
had felt under the weather before
running, she still felt good about
her race.
"It was a battle," McGuire said
of the meet overall. "You could tell
during the course of the race that
it was just back and forth."
Four freshmen also helped score
points for the Wolverines. Rebecca
Addison (13th) and Jillian Smith
(21st) both placed among the top
25. Kaitlyn Patterson claimed 27th
place, and Lindsey Hilton followed
behind in 45th.
The NCAA Championships will
be held Monday, Nov. 23, in Terre
Haute, Ind.

1:20 left in the game.
On the other hand, the Wol-
verines only had 21 offensive
plays after the break - seven of
which came in the last minute
and a half of the blowout.
"In the second half, it just
seems like, defensively, we're
not able to get off the field,"
Rodriguez said. "Our offense,
we need to be in some rhythm,
and when we're not on the field
much offensively and the other
team is controlling the ball, it's
hard to get into a rhythm offen-
sively.
"We need to evaluate every-
thing: the players, scheme, and
try to come up with answers.
That's my job to do as a coach."
Rodriguez's job as coach is
now to get Michigan prepared
for college football's greatest
rivalry. Although the Michigan
Ohio State game traditionally
decides the Big Ten title, the
Wolverines are shooting for a
much lower goal this week:
Bowl eligibility.
"It's not a game that's gonna
be hard for either team to get
fired up for. It's Michigan and
Ohio State," Rodriguez said.
"We got a lot at stake.
"The focus this week should
be great. I just hope the play
next Saturday is."
too early.
And after halftime, the fresh-
man didn't play nearly as well
against an adjusted defense. Just
as Purdue successfully switched
schemes last week, Wisconsin
changed its techniques on the
defensive line and disguised its
safeties better.
"The techniques were
designed to keep him out of the
pocket and (give) him less time
to throw the ball," Brinkley said.
Those adjustments, coupled
with Michigan's seven minutes
of possession in the second half,
limited Forcier to just 5-of-8
passing and 49 yards.
But as he said last Monday and
echoed after the game, Forcier is
focused on improving his play
to achieve one goal: "getting the
seniors to a bowl game.
"If I have to spend 10 hours
on film this week, I'm going to
do it," Forcier said. "But we're
gonna get them a bowl game
and we're going to come out and
do what we can do against Ohio
State."

By RUTH LINCOLN
DailySportsEditor
MADISON - Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez has said it time
and time again - the Wolverines
are a different team with Brandon
Minor in the game.
The senior tailback has battled
a high ankle sprain all year, and he
suffered a bruised shoulder during
his three-touchdown performance
against Purdue.
Those injuries NOTEBOOK
forced Minor to
disappear after just seven carries
for 26 yards against Wisconsin.
Minor was just one lowly com-
ponent of the Wolverines' dismal
rushing attack Saturday. The Wol-
verines had just 71 yards on 32 car-
ries and went without a rushing
touchdown for the first time since
losing to Michigan State on Oct. 3.
"After that first touchdown last
week, (Minor) was kind of hurt a
little bit," senior defensive end
Brandon Graham said. "He was
just telling me how I wish I could
go for you, but I was like, 'Don't
worry, we got people that's gonna
pick up where you left off.' "
One of those to pick up in
Minor's place was freshman Vin-
cent Smith.
Michigan fans have seen little
of the 5-foot-6 tailback during the
conference season. Excluding his
17 carries against Delaware State,
Smith had just 15 carries heading
into Wisconsin.
But Saturday, the pint-sized
Smith used his versatility and
flashiness in Michigan's produc-
tive first half as he pounded away
for 26 yards on seven carries.
"For being such a little guy,
especially in the Big Ten, you don't
see little backs too often," fresh-
man quarterback Tate Forcier.
"Look at Wisconsin. Twice the
size of him. But Vince played great
today. He made some key blocks
for me. He made some big plays."
Matched up against the tower-
ing Badger defense, Smith's big-
gest plays came in the passing
game. He gained impressive yards
after each catch and tallied six
receptions for 55 yards by half-
time.

The Pahokee, Fla., native's
most impressive play came when
Forcier connected with him on a
21-yard swing pass to tie the score
at 7-7 early in the first quarter.
But besides Smith's unexpected
receiving performance and sopho-
more slot receiver Roy Roundtree's
seven receptions for 56 yards, the
Badger defense shut down the
Wolverine receivers in the second
half. After notching 15 receptions
in the first half, Michigan man-
aged just six after the break.
"Our defensive line was active,"
Wisconsin defensive lineman
O'Brien Schofield said. "Guys were
running to the football and mak-
ing some plays that normally you
wouldn't think a defensive line
would make on some screens. Just
running to the receivers catching
the ball and trying to get in there."
D-LINE IMPRESSIONS: Very
rarely in college football do you
see a team relying solely on its
front four to carry its defense.
The Wolverines clearly aren't
moving in that direction under
defensive coordinator Greg Rob-
inson. But the performances
Michigan are getting upfront from
Graham and defensive tackles
Mike Martin and R-yan Van Ber-
gen makes the thought somewhat
appealing.
Despite giving up a season-high
45 points to Wisconsin, the trio
had career days.
Martin tallied a career-high
nine solo tackles, including three
for loss. The sophomore stifled
Badger quarterback Scott Tolzien
on a number of occasions.
Van Bergen's fumble-recov-
ery-turned-touchdown gave the
Wolverines critical points. It was
the first recovery turned score
since former Wolverine and two-
time Super Bowl winner LaMarr
Woodley did it against Notre
Dame in 2006.
Graham, who is easily the Wol-
verines' best player each game,
moved into second place for career
forced fumbles (seven). He now
trails just Woodley (10) for first
place.
The Badger defense couldn't
keep Graham out of the pocket
throughout the game. His two

sacks for 25 yards, four tackles for
a loss of 28 yards and his mouth
had everyone taking notice.
"They were definitely strong,"
Wisconsin tight end Lance Ken-
dricks said. "They talked a lot of
junk too. ... (Saying) 'You can't
hold me. Anybody want to hold
me? Somebody better hold me.'
Especially No. 55, Graham, he
was messing. But it was a good
time."
RED ZONE WOES: Examining
Wisconsin's 95.1 red zone conver-
sion rate would make any Wolver-
ine fan envious.
One can point to Wisconsin's
old-school, smashmouth offense
that works especially well at the
goal line.
"Welcome to Wisconsin foot-
ball," Badger head coach Bret
Bielma said. "That's what we do. It
may not be pretty."
With Minor limited, the Wol-
verines couldn't match the same
physicality at the goal line. After
going just 2-for-3 in the red zone
against Wisconsin, Michigan now
finds itself ranked last in the Big
Ten with alowly 68.9 percentage.
"It could be playcalling, you
know, it could be really anything,"
Forcier said.
The Wolverines' biggest blow
came when Michigan couldn't
convert on a first and goal from
the Wisconsin six-yard line late
in the first quarter. Michigan's
19-yard field goal attempt was
blocked.
"You want to put those into
touchdowns - any time you're
down there, you want to punch
it in," offensive coordinator Cal-
vin Magee said. "It was good to
come away with points the sec-
ond time, but of course you want
those extra few points, and we

that down."

made the most of it. You know, we
at just got a little bit of an argument,
" but me and Coach Rod are fine."
10 The most impressive part
9 about Forcier's performance
may be that it was in the absence
4 of senior running backs Brandon
3 Minor and Carlos Brown, who
were limited to a combined nine
2 carries due to injury. As a result,
2 the Badger defense focused pri-
g marily on Forcier rather than on
stopping the ground game.
But that isn't to say Forcier is
playing as well as he needs to for
the Wolverines to have a chance
s against Ohio State.
Forcier missed a few throws
when receivers got behind the
T ,nt defense, according to Magee.
a 1 He also struggled with negative
rushing yardage. Though Forcier
was sacked just twice (once on
L9 TO third down), he lost 24 yards on
15 N the ground and hurt Michigan
12 o at times by pulling the ball down

From the Editor: In celebra-
tion of Michigan-Ohio State
Week, we dove into the Daily
archives to find game stories
from seminal Michigan wins
in the series. Here's the story
from the Wolverines' 86-0 vic-
tory in 1902, one ofFielding H.
Yost'sfamous "PointA Minute"
teams. We hope you enjoy the
quirky writingstyle of the era.
What will we do,
What will we do,
We'll rub it into O. S. U.
That's what we'll do.
Thus sang the Michigan
rooters yesterday afternoon in
answer to the old Wah-hoo yell
raised proudly by 2,000 wearers
of the scarlet and gray.
And rub it in they did with
both hands and feet by the abso-
lutely unhoped for score of 86 to
0.
The Ohio rooters began to
arrive at 9:30 a. m. and special
train followed special train at
short intervals until the whole
city was thronged with the
excursionists. They overran the
campus in all directions and
penetrated into every building
including the Anatomical Labo-
ratory.
Shortly after 1 o'clock the
crowd began to stream out
toward Ferry Field and by a
quarter past two every inch of
available room on the big stands
and bleachers was occupied,
the late comers being forced to
stand up along the wire fences

enclosing the field.
The O. S. U. rooters filled
the whole east half of the south
bleachers and part of the grand
stand while the supporters of
Michigan swarmed on both
sides of the field.
The rooting before the game
was by far the best ever heard
on Ferry Field, song answering
song, and yell answering yell in
never ending succession. Michi-
gan seemed to have a shade the
best of it principally on account
of their forces being on both
sides of the field where the could
applaud each others efforts.
The O. S. U. band and the
Michigan band took turns at
working up the enthusiasm and
at 2:15, when the Michigan men
trotted on the field, followed
almost at once by the Buckeyes
the excitement was at the high-
est pitch.
The halves agreed upon were
35 and 25 minutes. O. S. U. won
the toss and chose to defend the
east goal.
Michigan having had no dif-
ficulty in stopping the visitors
rushes decided to punt at ()
expectingtowinonanexchange
of punts or else regain the ball
on downs and so advance more
rapidly than by a rushing game.
McLaren, the veteran half-
back, who had grown gray in
his service on the O. S. U. team,
became obstreperous at this
juncture and it looked for a
minute as though there would

be a little trouble but Hoagland
warned him for rough playing
and Hinkey gave a short lecture
to the two captains and the play
went on.
As usual Sweeley punted at
once and as usual the Ohians
were held for downs. While
Cartet was getting his hand ban-
daged, Weeks called for a play
and it went just the same with
only 10 men in the line-up...
0. S. U. has come and gone
and Michigan is eighty-six more
points to the good. We won
the game fairly and squarely,
and every point was contested
freely. But the overwhelming
victory was almost as much of a
surprise to Michigan as to Ohio
State. We had expected victory,
but had hardly hoped for a land-
slide.
This decidedly removes all
doubts as to the team being in
the best of shape next Saturday.
The apparent slump of a week
or so has done the team a great
deal more good than a week of
ordinary practice. It has brought
the team and the rooters to a
thorough realization of the fact
thatthe stiffestkind of work and
absolute unity must be the price
of the championship. This spirit
pervaded the team yesterday,
and the rooters did their full
share in encouraging them.
The rooting was much better
yesterday than it has been at any
time this year, a fact due in great
measure, no doubt, to the suc-
cessful singing.

THE QUICK BREAKDOWN
M A IZE GAU GE The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score. The Mesk-o-Meter measures the success of special teams, the Rod-o-Meter
judges how emotional (positive or negative) Rich Rodriguez was following the game and the Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

ROD-O-METER
2 Another defeat, another defeated Rich Rodriguez
,, postgame press conference. The questions were the
Rich Rods same, the answers were the same, his demeanor
was the same. lt's getting depressing, really.

MESK-O-METER
Well, not much to see here. Mesko punted just three times,
/1 4 Stonum only ripped off one decent return and Olesnavage's
Zoltans chip shot field goal was blocked. None oftthose mattered in
the end. It was a less-than-average special teams game.

HYPE-O-METER
3/ The student section missed Wisconsin's first score because of
Summ, drinking, but the students came through loud and clear
Big Houses after that. "Jump Around" made the stadium shake. We're
also fans of the "Let'sget wasted" chant. Need we say more?

LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

THE CLAWWWWWWWWWWW!
Former Daily Sports Editor Naweed Sikora lost his battle with
testicular cancer in mid-October, and a memorial service was held in
his honor in Ann Arbor two weekends ago. He was just 27 years old.
When he worked for Daily Sports, Sikora led a campaign to change
Michigan fans' post-defensive stard cheer from a Florida State-
like Tomahawk Chop to what he deemed The Claw, invoking the
ferocity of a Wolverine. This was the trend for a while, but students
have reverted back to the Chop.
Against Ohio State, try the Claw. After all, the Wolverines need all the
help against the Buckeyes they can get.

the ball for just over seven minutes after
the break.

2. ALABAMA (4): Mark
Ingram made Heisman
inroads with 19 carries for
149 yards and two TDs.
3. TEXAS (2): Colt McCoy
