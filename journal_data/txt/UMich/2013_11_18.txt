STEM passion starting early


FEMMES hopes
to inspire young
girls to pursue
science fields
By BROOKE PEARCY
For TheeDaily
Most fourth, fifth or sixth
graders don't get the chance to
learn from a college professor
about how the brain sends sig-
nals to muscles or how a pros-

thetic limb works.
That's unless they attended
the capstone event held Satur-
day by Females Excelling More
in Math, Engineering.
FEMMES is a student-run
organization that hosted the
first of its two capstone events.
The group of both graduate
and undergraduate students
arranged for girls to spend a
day participating in activities
in different science, technolo-
gy, engineering and math fields.
The Michigan chapter of the
organization was started in

2011 after the national group
was founded in 2006 At Duke
University.
Glory May Bradley, one of the
130 girls from nearby schools
who attended, has returned to
the event for the third time to
further explore scientific con-
cepts.
"I like doing all of the experi-
ments," Bradley said. "And I've
liked science since I could talk."
Rackham student Abigail
Garrity, the co-president of
FEMMES, hopes the girls will
leave with exactly the feeling

Bradley described.
"I want them to walk away
with asense of self-efficacy and
empowerment," Garrity said.
"I want them to walk away
inspired and excited about the
experiments and the activities
that they participated in."
Each of the activities at the
event was created and taught
by students and University
professors. Activities ranged
from making ice cream with
liquid nitrogen to creating glow
sticks.

Centralization of
support services
will move HR and
finance staffs
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Though many faculty and staff
have expressed concern with the
implementation of the University's
new Shared Services Center, Uni-
versity officials assured faculty
last week that no layoffs will result
from the planned integration of
human resource and financial ser-
vices into the consolidated office,
From the centralized location,
they will provide those services to
the University at large, rather than
being placed with specific depart-
ments or colleges.
In preparation for the merging
of services, 50 finance and human
resources positions were unfilled
over the last few months, allowing
the University to maintain posi-
tions for all current employees

impacted by the change.
Additionally, staff members
who accept similar positions in
the Shared Services Center are
not likely to see a decrease in their
base salaries. University spokes-
man Rick-Fitzgerald said admin-
istrators completed individual
meetings with affected staff mem-
bers Friday.
Many of the employees affected
are responsible for services like
billing, employee expense reim-
bursements, travel benefits, ven-
dor payments or registering new
employees through Wolverine
Access. Traditionally, departments
or colleges have retained their
own employees who handle these
duties.
Inthe new Shared Services Cen-
ter, each employee will likely spe-
cialize in one of these tasks. Each
staff member would focus on one
area of the shared services spec-
trum at a University-wide level.
The center will open in April
and the remaining department-
level finance- and human-resourc-
es staff will transition there by

Saturday
EVANSTON, Ill. - For almost
58 minutes of game time, this
was about as bad as football can
'be played. Neither Michigan nor
Northwest-
ern could
score points
- not because
the defenses'
were play-
ing particu-
larly well, but
because the EVERETT
offenses were COOK
just that bad.
Atonepoint
in the fourth quarter, the Wild-
cats had the ball deep in their own
red zone and were forced to punt.
It traveled a grand total of seven
yards. The Wolverines got the ball
on the 10-yard line. You couldn't
ask for more of an offensive gift.
They lost a yard and had to kick
a field goal.
It was ugly football. North-
western dropped four potential
interceptions. Two of them would
have been pick-sixes. There were a
combined 14 punts. On top of that,
it was rainy and windy, aprecursor
to the massive storm that hit Chi-
cago on Sunday morning.

produce research that will have a
large societal impact.

A "cube" is made up of three
University faculty members
from different disciplines who

Midwest tornadoes, storms
cause damage, injury, death

Boeing 737 crashes on its way
to Russia,killing 50 passengers

I

At least three
people are dead in
central Illinois
CHICAGO (AP) - Dozens
of tornadoes and intense thun-
derstorms swept across the
Midwest on Sunday, causing
extensive damage in several
central Illinois communities,
killing at least three people
and prompting officials at Chi-
cago's Soldier Field to evacuate
the stands and delay the Bears
game.
"The whole neighborhood's
gone. The wall of my fireplace
is all that is left of my house,"
said Michael Perdun, speaking
by cellphone from the hard-hit
town of Washington, where
he said his neighborhood was

wiped out inamatter of seconds.
"I stepped outside and I
heard it coming. My daughter
was already in the basement, so
I ran downstairs and grabbed
her, crouched in the laundry
room and all of a sudden I could
see daylight up the stairway and
my house was gone."
An elderly man and his sister
were killed when a tornado hit
their home around noon in the
rural community of New Min-
den, said Mark Styninger, the
coroner of Washington County
in southern Illinois. A third
person diedin Washington, said
Melanie Arnold of the Illinois
Emergency Management Agen-
cy. She did not provide details.
By mid-afternoon, with com-
munications difficult and many
roads impassable, it remained
unclear how many people were

killed or hurt by the string of
tornadoes. In a news release,
the Illinois National Gnard said
it had dispatched 10 firefighters
and three vehicles to Washing-
ton to assist with immediate
search and recovery operations.
"I went over there immedi-
ately after the tornado, walking
through the neighborhoods, and
I couldn't even tell what street I
was on," Washington Alderman
Tyler Gee told WLS-TV. _
"Just completely flattened -
some of the neighborhoods here
in town, hundreds of homes."
Steve Brewer, chief operat-
ing officer at Methodist Medi-
cal Center of Illinois in Peoria,
said 14 people had come to the
hospital seeking treatment for
minor injuries, while another
Washington area hospital had
received about 15 patients.

Plane caught on
fire while landing
at Kazan airport
MOSCOW (AP) - A Boeing
737 jetliner crashed and burst into
flames Sunday night while trying
toland at the airport in the Russian
city of Kazan, killing all 5o people
aboard in the latest in a string of
deadly crashes across the country.
The Tatarstan Airlines plane
was trying to make a second
landing attempt when it touched
the surface of the runway near
the control tower, and was
"destroyed and caught fire," said
SergeiIzvolky, the spokesman for
the Russian aviation agency.
The Emergencies Ministry
said there were 44 passengers
and six crew members aboard the

evening flight from Moscow and
all had been killed. Kazan, a city
of about 1.1 million and the capi-
tal of the Tatarstan republic, is
about 720 kilometers (450 miles)
east of the capital.
The ministry released a list
of the dead, which included
Irek Minnikhanov, the son of
Tatarstan's governor, and Alex-
ander Antonov, who headed the
Tatarstan branch of the Federal
Security Service, the main succes-
sor agency tothe Soviet-eraKGB.
Some Russian air crashes have
been blamed on the use of aging
aircraft, but industry experts
point to a number of other prob-
lems, including poor crew train-
ing, crumbling airports, lax
government controls and wide-
spread neglect of safety in the
pursuit of profits.
The Emergencies Ministry

released photographs from the
nighttime scene showing parts of
the aircraft and debris scattered
across the ground. Ambulances
lined up in front of the airport
building.
It was not clear why the plane's
first landing attempt was unsuc-
cessful. Boeing said it would
provide assistance to the investi-
gation into the cause.
"Boeing's thoughts are with
those affected by the crash," the
company said in a statement on
its website.
A journalist who said she had
flown on the same aircraft from
Kazan to Moscow's Domodedo-
vo airport earlier in the day told
Channel One state television that
the landing in Moscow had been
frightening because of a strong
vibration during the final min-
utes of the flight.

ill, can't speak,
former wife says
South Africa's former presi-

"quite ill" and unable to speak
because of tubes that are keeping
his lungs clear of fluid, though he
is relaxed, his former wife told a
South African newspaper.
"He remains very sensitive to
any germs, so he has to be kept
literally sterile. The bedroom
there (in his suburban Johannes-
burg home) is like an ICU ward,"
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela told
the Sunday Independent. "He is
95 years old and it is difficult for
him, because of all the tubes that
are in his mouth to clear the (fluid

from his) lungs, and prevent an
infection recurring." Because of
those tubes, she said, he commu-
nicates through his face.
"But the doctors have told
us they hope he will be able to
recover his voice," she said, add-
ing that he is being treated by 22
doctors at his home.

U.N. climate talks
this week to discuss
global failure
U.N. climate talks head into a
tense final week Monday after the
diplomatic effort to reduce global
warming gases was hit by a series
of setbacks, including Japan's
decision to ditch its voluntary
emissions target.
The two-decade-old negotia-
tions have so far failed to achieve
their goal of slashing emissions of
C02 and other greenhouse gases
that scientists say are warming
the planet. They don't seem to be
getting any closer after a tumul-
tuous first week at this year's ses-
sion in Warsaw.
Despite a tearful call for
action from a delegate from the
typhoon-ravaged Philippines,
no major carbon polluter raised
their pledges to cut emissions.

Half of the Senate
approves military
sexual-assault bill

In this Wednesday, April17, 2013 file photo, Pakistan's former president and military ruler Pervez Musharraf, center,
leaves after appearing in court in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
Pakistan to try its former
president with treason

Musharraf to be
first military ruler
tried for crime
ISLAMABAD (AP) - Paki-
stan's.government plans to put
former President Pervez Mush-
arraf on trial for treason for
declaring a state of emergency
and suspending the constitution
while in power, the interior min-
ister said Sunday.
Musharraf, a former army
chief, would be the first military
ruler tried for treason in a coun-
try that has experienced three
military coups in its 66-year
history. He could face the death
penalty or life in prison if he is
convicted of treason, but some
question whether the country's
powerful army actually will
let that happen. Musharraf has
maintained his innocence.
The government plans to send
a letter to the Supreme Court
on Monday asking that treason
proceedings begin under Article
6 of the constitution, Interior
Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali
Khan said during a news confer-
ence. The government made its

decision after an inves- ti-
gating committee formed under
the direction of the Supreme
Court collected enough evi-
dence for a trial, Khan said.
"Gen. Musharraf is accbunt-
able to the nation and the consti-
tution," Khan said.
He specifically mentioned
Musharraf's decision to sus-
pend senior judges, including
the chief justice of the Supreme
Court, and detain them after he
declared a state of emergency on
Nov. 3, 2007. He was apparently
concerned they would challenge
his re-election as president.
"The constitution was ruined
and violated,"Khan said. "The judi-
ciary was humiliated. Judges were
manhandled physically, confined
along with family and children."
The interior minister insisted
that the government's decision
to put the former president on
trial for treason was not a per-
sonal vendetta by Prime Min-
ister Nawaz Sharif, who was
toppled in a military coup by
Musharraf in 1999.
The government didn't indicate
it would press charges against
Musharraf for his coup, perhaps
because the move was retroac-

tively approved by the Supreme
Court and parliament at the time.
One of Musharraf's lawyers,
Ilyas Siddiqui, said the former
president's legal team would
decide its strategy once the court
formally begins proceedings.
The prime minister said
in June that the government
intended to try Musharraf for
treason, but would consult with
other political parties on the
move. Senior lawmakers from
the two main opposition parties
expressed their support for the
government's plan to try Mush-
arraf at the time.
Musharraf 'governed the
country for nearly a decade after
the 1999 coup but was forced to
step down in 2008 after grow-
ing discontent with his rule. He
left the country soon after. He
returned to Pakistan in March
after years in self-imposed exile,
with the hope of running in the
national election that was held
in May. But he was disqualified
from participating in the vote
because of his actions while in
power and has spent most of his
time battling legal cases.
Musharraf was held under
house arrest for months after

Legislation proposes
giving special
counsel to survivors
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen.
Kirsten Gillibrand has secured
public support from nearly half
the Senate, but not enough votes,
for her proposal to give victims
of rape and sexual assault in the
military an independent route
outside the chain of command
for prosecuting attackers.
Gillibrand's solution for a
problem the military calls an
epidemic appears to have stalled
in the face of united opposition
from the Pentagon's top ech-
elon and its allies in Congress,
including two female senators
who are former prosecutors.
Opponents of the proposal by
Gillibrand, D-N.Y., :insist that
commanders, not an outside mil-
itary lawyer, must be account-
able for meting out justice.
Even so, major changes are
coming for a decades-old military
system just a few months after
several high-profile cases infu-
riated Republicans and Demo-
crats ina rapid chain of events by
Washington standards.
"Sexual assault in the mili-
tary is not new, but it has been
allowed to fester," Gillibrand
said in a recent Senate speech.
The Senate this week is set to
consider an annual defense policy
bill that would strip commanders
of their ability to overturn jury
convictions, require dishonor-
able discharge or dismissal for
any individual convicted of sexu-
al assault and establish a civilian
review when a decision is made
not to prosecute a case.
The bill would provide a
special counsel for victims and
eliminate the statute of limita-
tions.
Those changes in military
law are backed by members of

the Senate Armed Services
Committee. But overshadow-
ing the revisions is the testy,
intense fight over Gillibrand's
proposal to strip commanders
of their authority to prosecute
cases of sexual assault. She
wants to hand responsibility
to seasoned military lawyers
outside the chain of command.
Her solution has divided
the Senate, splitting Republi-
cans and Democrats, men and
women, even former attorneys
general, into unusual coalitions.
The lobbying has been fierce,
with dueling data, testimonials
and news conferences with vic-
tims. Opponents invited Marine
Corps Brig. Gen. Loretta Reyn-
olds to the closed-door Republi-
can caucus last week.
Among Gillibrand's 47
announced supporters are con-
servative Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Tex-
as, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., along
with 16 of the Senate's 20 women.
Standing against the plan
is the chairman of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Commit-
tee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.;
the panel's military veterans
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Jack
Reed, D-R.L, and three of the
committee's women - Sens.
Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and
Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., both for-
mer prosecutors, and Sen. Deb
Fischer, R-Neb.
Gillibrand says she privately has
received backing from more than
50 senators, but support remains
short of the filibuster-proof 60
votes that likely will be needed for
her amendment to the defense bill.
To secure more votes, she said last
week she was considering scaling
back her plan to focus solely on
sexual assault and rape instead of
all serious crimes. That prompt-
ed complaints from her original
backers that it would create "pink
courts," and Gillibrand said on
ABC's "This Week" Sunday she
wasrevertingto herinitialbill.

Libya residents protest city's
recent violent militia attacks

Syrians flood into
Lebanon amid fights

Fights over
weekend resulted
in nearly 50 deaths.
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -
Residents of the Libyan capi-
tal launched a general strike
Sunday and held protests,
demanding the city's myriad of
powerful militias be disbanded
after violence in which nearly
50 people were killed over the
weekend.
Tripoli residents are seeth-
ing with anger over the violence
that erupted Friday, particular-
ly directed at powerful militias
from the western city of Misra-
ta operating in the capital. The
violence broke out when thou-
sands of protesters marched"
on a neighborhood controlled
by a number of powerful Mis-
rata militias, prompting some
militiamen to open fire, killing
43 people. A day later, another
militia attempted to overrun
a military base, resulting in a
clash with government forces
that left four dead.
In an apparent angry
response at the popular pres-
sure, Misrata's city council
announced late Sunday that it is
withdrawing its representatives
from the interim national par-
liament and from the Cabinet.
Misrata has at least two min-
isters in the government: the
economy and culture ministers.
The Misrata city council also
called on all armed groups, even
those who are working under
the government, to withdraw
from the capital for a 72-hour
period.
In its statement, the Misrata
city council held the govern-
ment responsible for the secu-
rity situation in Tripoli and for
the safety of citizens originally
from Misrata. There was no
immediate government reac-
tion to the decision.
Earlier Sunday, a security

official said the deputy intelli-
gence chief was abducted as he
left Tripoli's airport. It was not
clear who abducted Mustafa
Nouh, whose family is original-
ly from Misrata.
Public anger had been direct-
ed at the militias from Misrata,
who had developed a strong
presence in the capital follow-
ing the fall of longtime dictator
Moammar Gadhafi in 201L
Except for several protests,
streets were deserted as the
vast majority of Tripoli's busi-
nesses and schools were closed,
with bakeries, pharmacies,
hospitals and gas stations the
main exception. The head of
Tripoli's city council, Al-Sadat
al-Badri, said the strike is to
last three days.
Fearing renewed violence,
armed residents have set up
checkpoints to protect their
neighborhoods.
On Sunday, nearly a hundred
protesters entered the parlia-
ment building while lawmakers
were in session, demanding leg-
islation to disband the militias
and forcing the session to break
up.
Lawmaker Fatma al-Misbari
said the interim parliament was
under strong pressure, but it did
not specify from whom.
"There is no consensus.
There is pressure on the council
and the government," she said
at the parliament building.
Libya's militias originated
in the "revolutionary" brigades
that fought against Gadhafi's
forces in 2011. Since his ouster
and death, they have refused to
disarm and have grown in size
and power. Many have been
enlisted by the state to serve as
security forces, since the army
and police remain weak, unde-
requipped and underpaid. But
many continue to act as armed
vigilante factions with their
own interests, sometimes turn-
ing political feuds into armed
conflicts.

Too weak to disarm the mili-
tias, the military, police and
government have tried to co-
opt them, paying them to take
on security roles such as guard-
ing districts, facilities, and even
polling stations during elec-
tions. But the policy has back-
fired, empowering the militias
without controlling them.
At the parliament, protesters
carried a coffin draped in Lib-
ya's post-Gadhafi flag and held
posters declaring those killed in
the recent violence to be "mar-
tyrs of dignity."
Speaking to Libya's Al-Ahrar
TV, Ali Azouz said the protest-
ers had entered the building to
demand that legislators order
the disbanding of militias and
their removal from Tripoli.
"We were revolutionar-
ies since (the start of the 2011
uprising) but when we were
asked to hand back our weap-
ons we did so and went back to
work," Azouz said, denounc-
ing the existence of the armed
groups.
Libya's state news agency
LANA said Sunday that the
Misrata militias accused of
being responsible for Friday's
killings in the southern Tripoli
neighborhood of Gharghour
had abandoned their bases
there. The militias had turned
villas and residential com-
pounds of former Gadhafi-era
officials into camps where they
stashed weapons.
It is not clear where the Mis-
rata militias went.
A government-affiliated mili-
tia, the Libya Shield-Central
Command, announced late Sat-
urday that it had taken control
ofGharghour, declaring it a mil-
itary zone and vowing to turn it
over to the government. 'The
majority of Libya Shield's mili-
tiamen also hail from Misrata.
Many Tripoli residents also
marched in protest against
Libya Shield's takeover of
Gharghour.

Clashes occur as
government tries to

BEIRUT (AP) - Thousands
of Syrians poured into Lebanon,
taking shelter in wedding halls
and makeshift shacks after flee-
ing heavy fighting in a moun-
tainous region across the border
in Syria, while a massive explo-
sion Sunday targeting a govern-
ment building outside Damascus
killed at least 31 soldiers.
The clashes in Qalamoun, an
area that stretches north of the
Syrian capital along the Leba-
nese frontier, appeared to be
part of a long-anticipated gov-
ernment offensive aimed at cut-'
ting an important rebel supply
route and cementing President
Bashar Assad's hold on a key
corridor from the capital to the
coast
- A government victory in the

strategic region would deal a
severe blow'to the already belea-
guered rebels on Damascus'
doorstep. Over the past month,
Assad's forces have made head-
way against the rebels on two
key fronts, capturing a string of
opposition-held suburbs south of
Damascus and taking two towns
and a military base outside the
northern city of Aleppo.
Still, the opposition remains
firmly entrenched in other areas
around Damascus and capable
of carrying out large attacks. A
massive bombing Sunday leveled
a government office in the north-
eastern suburbof Harasta,killing
at least 31 soldiers, according to
the Britain-based Syrian Obser-
vatory for Human Rights.
Three brigadiers and one
major general were among the
dead, according to the group's
director, Rami Abdurrahman.
There was no immediate con-
firmation from government offi-
cials or state media.

Uprooted without engagement
University administration shouldn't suppress staff input
University administration's plans to consolidate some support ser-
vices drew ire from members of the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee for University Affairs last week. As part of the University's
Administrative Services Transformation project, the University plans on
bringing together human resource and financial services into one main
center at the University. While University officials maintain that no firings
will occur as part of the planned transition, the administration's disregard
for faculty involvement in the project raises red flags.

Under the administration's plan, the new
Shared Services Center will move human
resources and financial staffs from indi-
vidual departments into one centralized
location. According to MLive, these posi-
tions work in "accounting, billing, financial
accounts for units, expense reimbursement,
benefit administration, data management,
and employee time tracking." In a letter
written to University President Mary Sue
Coleman on behalf of the Department of
History, faculty members argue that moving
the department's financial administrators
could hinder the department's productivity:
"(AST's) short-sighted focus on task efficien-
cy will undermine the long-term productivity
that emerges from the daily personal interac-
tions between staff, students, and faculty."
While it's clear that the University's plan to
integrate these services into one building is an
attempt to efficiently cut costs through stream-
lined services, the purported financial benefits
of centralizing services appears to be, at the
very least, questionable. Initially, AST's project
was intended to save the University $17 million,
but now is "expected to be just $5 million in
four years." Plans similar to the consolidation
project have had mixed results at other uni-
versities, such as the University of California,

Berkeley; Yale University; and the University of
Texas system. At Texas, for instance, the con-
sultingfirm that devised the university's shared
services program cost the UT system nearly $1
million, angering staff within the Texas State
Employees Union, which argued that the con-
sultants based their restructuring recommen-
dations based on "undisclosed research."
Department heads were notified of this
change in September with the caveat that they
not discuss it with faculty and staff. Kathleen
Canning, the chair of the Department of His-
tory, said the gag was unprecedented. "It's a
bit confusing when you're a public university
professor and you're told you're not allowed
to speak (about the changes)." The limitations
on deans and department heads only adds to
growing concern of the University's lack of
transparency.
While streamlining services are no strang-
ers to universities, the move to both consoli-
date staff members and suppress the voice of
their respective departments is unprecedented.
With questionable benefits and poor methods
employed to reach its decision, the administra-
tion appears to have handed out a top-down
order without regarding its employees. The
University should not uproot its employees
without, at the very least, engaging them.

Economic inequality affects all

As presidents of the Graduate Employees
Organization and the Lecturers' Employee
Organization, we must express our extreme
concern regarding the Administration Ser-
vices \Transformation Project, euphemis-
tically referred to as a "shared services"
model. This model means that University
employees in a wide range of financial and
human resources positions are currently
being required to reapply for new and fewer
redesigned positions with no guarantee of
rehire. Whether at this stage of the projec-
tor the next, some staff members will lose
their jobs and others will be moved to a dif-
ferent employment unit. Reapplication is a
degrading and fear-producing experience
for workers.
Years ago, LEO fought against a similar
process that kept lecturers in a perpetual
state of being new employees by requiring
them to reapply on a yearly basis. This is not
good for employees or the colleagues who
rely on them. Uncertainty in one's employ-
ment leads to anxiety in the workplace, loss
of employee loyalty and increased tension
between laborers and their supervisors. The
University is promoting this as a cost-saving
measure, but the estimates of just how much
these drastic measures will save is continu-
ally dropping according to revisions. Based
on the corporate model of downsizing, this
"cost-saving measure" is a step toward the
dehumanization of University employees
and our working environment.
In addition, the top-down and secre-
tive nature of the Administrative Services
Transformation Project flies in the face of
shared governance, a cornerstone of aca-
demia. As academics, GEO and LEO mem-
bers are committed to the concept of shared
governance as an essential aspect of the
University. The designers of ATS did not

fully engage faculty in the planning stages,
and thus failed to understand that central-
izing Information Technology Services
and accounting services would cause utter
havoc, especially in departments and col-
leges with multi-million dollar grant pro-
grams, with large numbers of graduate
students employed as research assistants.
Decreased efficiency and productivity has
been the result of this model when tried
elsewhere, including the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley.
GEO and LEO, as unions of laborers,
stand in solidarity with the non-organized
staff members who are being most affected
by the current "shared services" reduction
in force. We are committed to fair employ-
ment practices for all. We are opposed to
the top-down management style of corpora-
tions becoming the operational style of our
University.
We call for full disclosure of the long-
term shared services plan and for the inclu-
sion of faculty in all future planning of the
ADT Project. As committed members of this
educational institution, we stand with our
academic and staff sisters and brothers. We
all have a stake in keeping the University a
humane workplace, where workers and aca-
demics are a respected part of our educa-
tional community.
Representatives of our unions will be
participating in ongoing discussions with
other faculty and staff with a view to ensure
that our University does not pursue restruc-
turing fads, originating in the for-profit
corporate sector, that are at odds with our
public mission and our tradition of shared
governance.
Bonnie Halloran is the president of LEO
and Liz Rodrigues is the president of GEO.

ast week I had the oppor-
tunity to interview Jacques
Mistral, a French economist
with extensive
private and pub-
lic sector expe-
rience who also
happens to be a
visiting profes-
sor at the Uni-
versity this fall.
I started with a LISSA
simple question: KRYSKA '
Why should stu-
dents care about
economic inequality?
It's a question that I ask myself
every time I write this column,
and while I have my own reasons
for caring, I think the reasons that
Mistral presented do an excellent
job of summing it up. His response
not only encompassed the moral.
implications of inequality, but also
provided economic, social and
political reasons that we should
care about as well.
The moral questions are the most
obvious ones. Religion plays a role in
many people's moral compasses, and
allthreemajormonotheisticreligions
include mandates to care for the less
fortunate among us. Conversations
about inequality also tend to include
discussions of work ethic, individual
responsibility and fairness. Person-
ally, I think it's a moral imperative to
work toward a less unequal society;
but the moral question is something
that everyone has to examine and
decide for themselves. Mistral feels
that it's about finding the right bal-
ance of liberty and equality.
There are also more concrete rea-
sons why we should be concerned
about rising inequality. On the eco-
nomic side, Mistral noted that the
common belief that inequality is the
"price to pay" for an efficient econ-
omy doesn't actually seem to hold.
He pointed out the growing body of
evidence showing that more equal

societies are also more

Fitzgerald said the University
would recoup savings not only
from employing 50 fewer staff
members, but also by making
operations more efficient, saving
about $5 million during the first
few years.
"As you move forward, the
data indicates we'll continue to
have savings through more effi-
cient operations," Fitzgerald
said. "By having skilled special-
ists in place working together, we
believe we'll continue to handle
an increased number of transac-
tions more effectively."
The University piloted this
model by centralizing servic-
es for offices in the Fleming
Administration Building with
no adverse effects, Fitzgerald
added.
However, at the Senate Advi-
sory Committee for University
Affairs meeting Monday, faculty
voiced concerns regarding the
University's handling of the

He added that he could not

He also noted the University

said the University could have
done better in addressing con-
cerns earlier on.
"There's been some level of

clear we didn't communicate

into something salvageable.
The stuck around until the
end to see a wide receiver with
nine catches for the season save
the game with a slide and a kicker
that couldn't win a game despite
three chances in Happy Valley last
month nail a 44-yard field goal at
literally the last possible moment.
They stuck around to see a
player who has taken more criti-

two months pass for a touchdown
and then run for another before
converting a two-point conver-

They stuck around because
at its core, this is what college
football is all about, the chance
to see something like the last
120 seconds on Saturday, even if
the first 58 were maybe the most
unimpressive minutes they've
witnessed in recent memory. The
odds for that type of ending aren't
high, but they exist.
And for once this season, it
doesn't have to be more compli-
cated than that. it doesn't have to
be about offensive coordinator Al
Borges and his repetitive play call-

the University community.
"It is clear we were not sensi-
tive or consultative enough in the
planning and communication of
this initiative," they wrote. "We
deeply value every member of the
university community, and regret
that the early stages of the pro-
cess did not live up to our shared
values."
The administrators added that
the University did not clearly
articulate available support for
staff affected by the transition.
"As this process has moved
forward, we do now have enough
information about the process to
address at least a couple of the
important concerns that were
raised," Fitzgerald said.
The letter stated that the Uni-
versity would provide training
for every member who accepts
a new position. In addition, the
University plans to provide sup-
port for units whose relocated
staff held additional duties in the
department or college.
"It is true that we sometimes
have to make difficult chang-
es to continue to protect the
resources that are so vital to
our core academic mission, but
it is our responsibility to do so
in the most respectful and sup-
portive manner possible," the
statement read.

DAAP is the oldest party to run
candidates in the student govern-
ment elections. Created in 1997
before CSG existed in its current
constitutional form, the party is
known for its longstanding sup-

action when the Michigan Stu-

student government - endorsed
affirmative action at the Univer-
sity-level in 2001.
ning back Derrick Green hasn't
been getting more carries up
until this point, or about how this
affects who goes to whatbowl.
We don't need'to draw out big
conclusions or make sweeping
judgments, just like we do every
other week of the year.
None of that stuff matters. For
the most part, this is not a good
football team. The 2013 season is
not going to go down in the hal-
lowed annals of Schembechler
Hall. So, whether this team plays
in the Outback Bowl or the Gator
Bowl or the Buffalo Wild Wings
Bowl is not important.
What's important is the last
two minutes of Saturday's game,
and the potential for those two
minutes that kept 50,000 soaking
people in their seats, waiting for a
miracle ending from a team that
gave no indication of being able to
pull off such an ending.
People left the stadium
drenched, cold and sniffling. They
left with their wallets lighter.
But they also left with an
improbable memory, of slides
and overtimes. Maybe the season
doesn't matter anymore, but for a
night, nobody cared.

The program was original-
ly scheduled to end in August
2014. However, during the event,
MCubed announced the launch
of the External Funding Pro-
gram, which will allow outside
investors to get involved with the
projects on the MCubed website.
The MCubed Symposium was
the first gathering of all 222 cubes.
More than 1,200 people attended
the event, including University
faculty, staff and students.
"Only at Michigan would
we see political scientists and a
computer engineer using satel-
lite data to study how variations
in energy access lead to political
unrest," wrote University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman in the
symposium's brochure. "MCubed

innovation that drives this insti-
tution, whether in the labora-
tory, studio, clinic, classroom or
library."

ed States are not fully prepared
for science and math when they
get to college."
State Rep. Adam Zemke (D-
Ann Arbor) also attended the
FEMMES capstone event and
was able to engage in activi-
ties with the kids. Zemke,
who has worked with the
state government to increase
grant opportunities for orga-
nizations like FEMMES, said
Tony Fadell, CEO and founder
of the technology company Nest
and inventor of the iPod, deliv-
ered the keynote address.
"Don't do something just
because it is the way it is has
always been done; think of new
ways to innovate and improve,"
Fadell said.
The symposium highlighted
specific cubes,. including the
Holy Braille, which sought to
create technologies that would
allow blind people to use devices
like smart phones. The project
brought together professors from
the School of Engineering and the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance.
Sara Soderstrom, an assis-
tant professor of Organizational
Studies and the Program in the
Environment, said the program
offered a lot of flexibility in
research. She said the money pro-
vided by MCubed was very gen-
erous, especially for research in
the social sciences.
"All you had to have was an
idea, and they would give you the
money," Soderstrom said.
Soderstrongs cube included

professors from the Business
and Kinesiology Schools. Their
research focused on food sus-
tainability, in partnership with
FoodLab in Detroit. Soderstrom's

undergraduates and one graduate
student over the summer to con-

Rackham student Nayiri
Kaissarian said she attended

Public Policy senior Kelsey
Rhodes assisted in planning
for the MCubed Symposium
as a speaker liaison and coach
because of her previous experi-
ence with TEDxUofM. She said
members of the MCubed board
admired TEIDxUofM and wanted
to bring some of the spirit of TED

"When you go to research con-

"It doesn't compare with seeing

His partners-in-crime Jake

experience they hope to bring

is the longest running show
on CollegeHumor, and the two
have been dubbed "comics to

As pretentious as it sounds,
there's really something to
binge-watching a TV show that
reminds me of getting lost in
a great book, especially when
said TV show is HBO's "The
Wire."
The epic crime drama is
joined by "The Sopranos" and
"The West Wing" in the cat-
egory of "great shows not on TV
anymore but everyone should
still watch" - along with new-
est member "Breaking Bad."
But these shows aren't alone.
"Freaks and Geeks." "Firefly."
"Twin Peaks." So many great

close to him say he tends to sim-
ply stare at people, absorbing
them, dissecting them, appreci-
ating them. He transposes this
practice onto the set of "Blue,"
where, at all times, two cameras
float in front of each actress's
face. You can't cheat expression
with that closeness. For better or
for best, he sought to remove fab-
rication and make them confess
to the camera with everything
they have. And only through this
dear bond between him and his
leading ladies could he portray
the film's beating heart: One per-
son can change your life.

'Floor' avoids generic love story

avoid the trap- TBS
pings of this
generic setup.
It delivers a good mix of comedy
and lighthearted drama, enough
to satisfy and amuse even if you're
familiar with the material.
The premise is basically Shake-
speare-lite, evoking ideas from
"Romeo and Juliet" but without
the drastic stakes. Skylar Astin
("Pitch Perfect") plays Brody
Moyer, a successful banker who
has a one-night stand with Jenny
Miller, played by Briga Hee-
lan ("Cougar Town"). Feelings
between the two linger past the
night, but problems ensue when
Brody discovers Jenny comes from
the bottom of the social ladder,
working in the maintenance room
of Brody's workplace.
The socioeconomic differences
threaten to end their relationship
before it even begins, and though
this may seem dire, I would say
chances are "Ground Floor" won't
be an epic tragedy on the scale of
"Romeo and Juliet." Instead, much
of the show's humor is derived
from the tension their different

social backgrounds create. Not
only are Brody and Jenny unsure
what to think of their romance, but
their coworkers are rather frus-
tratedwiththeirbrewingrelation-
ship and warn the couple against
moving forward with things.
This is where the supporting
cast really shines. Rory Scovel
("Conan") plays Mark "Harvard"
Shrake, a maintenance worker
who also expresses interest in
Jenny. The conflict between him
and Brody never becomes too
serious, and really he just high-
lights the amusement one can get
from watching people from such
different backgrounds interact.
Meanwhile, John C. McGinley
("Scrubs") has a standout perfor-
mance as Brody's boss Remington
StewartMansfield, acrazedwork-
obsessed man who acts as a carica-
ture ofaone-percentbusinessman.
The writers wisely use McGinley's
talent sparingly, so he still man-
ages to steal the scenes he's in but
without undermining the rest of
the cast's effort.
Despite the sometimes shallow
portrayals of both the rich and the
poor, both sides probably wouldn't
take much offense to "Ground
Floor"'s material. The pilot always
retains a sense of fun exaggera-

tion, so that one never takes it too
seriously. Regardless, this doesn't
mean the actual drama fails to be
interesting. Jenny and Brody's
romance is perhaps the show's
weakest element by itself, but it
doesn't drag the first episode down
too much, seeing how much of
the comedy spins off from their
growing feelings and how their
coworkers react. Still, as the show
progresses, this factor needs the
most improvement if the show's to
reach greater heights. The humor
isn't always on target either, but for
now it's solid and makes the show
worth checking out.
A new take on
boy-meets-girl.
Though it sometimes becomes
a little generic, thanks to a seen-it-
before setup, the show has a good
handle on its comedic elements
and develops a great supporting
cast. As it stands by itself, the pilot
is a little rough around the edges,
but nonetheless, "Ground Floor" '
has a strong opening and plenty of
promise.

Just 2:18 remained, and the

9-6 to Northwestern. The Wol-

own 22-yard line, desperately
trying to mount a final drive.
About even with the line of
scrimmage, on the sideline, Gib-
bons was kicking away.
Something seemed strange:
the net was positioned a few
yards in front of a patch cut out
of the Ryan Field grass. Each

Five Things We Learned:

Gardner makes final escape Michigan vs. Northwestern

Daily Sports Editor
EVANSTON - There was
one more pack of people for
Devin Gardner to weave
through, one more escape to
make before answering ques2
tions from the media about
one of the craziest, improb-
able wins of his career, a 27-19
triple-overtime victory over
Northwestern on Saturday.
After wading through a
throng of fans, the redshirt

junior quarterback hugged his
family, whispering into their
ears and smiling before walk-

fans - were the last obstacle
that remained for the Wolver-
ine that hadn't been able to
avoid any sort of contact the
last three weeks.
They swarmed, just like
Michigan State, Nebraska and
Northwestern had, and sur-

ner took a step back. He wasn't
going to get trapped again.
Last week, the same player
that had 584 total yards against
Indiana was struggling to get
off the turf after yet another
failed third-down conversion
that ended in a sack. For much
of Saturday, not much seemed
to have changed.

times on Saturday by the Wild-

1. The flaws remain, despite the
win.
Everything had fallen into
place for the Michigan football
team's offense. The execution,
the bounces, the luck - it had all
gone Michigan's way to set up
the best scoring opportunity of
the game.
Michigan trailed by six to
open the fourth quarter when
senior receiver Joe Reynolds
downed a punt from junior Matt

Wile on the 1-yard line. Reynolds
tiptoed the goal line before fall-
ing into the end zone.
The defense did its part, suffo-
cating the Northwestern offense
and allowing just two yards on
the drive. Even the Wildcats
pitched in with a miserable,
seven-yard punt that set up the
Wolverines on the 10-yard line.
If Michigan could score a touch-
down, it would take the lead.
But Michigan went backward.
After a stretch run to freshman
Derrick Green lost a yard, red-
shirt junior quarterback Devin
Gardner threw a badly under-

thrown pass to sophomore Devin
Funchess and then a badly over-
thrown pass to senior Jeremy
Gallon. Michigan settled for a
field goal.
Michigan won, ultimately,
and the 27-19 score betrayed
what was another anemic offen-
sive performance. In regulation,
Michigan scored just nine points.
It was 0-for-13 on third down
before overtime.
There were improvements.

Michigan (9-1-1 Big Ten, 16-3-

its sixth shutout in eight games.
Besides the early near-goal,
the Wolverines were strong from
the outset, recovering from a
first-round Big Ten Tournament
loss last week.
"We weren't satisfied, weren't
happy with what happened at the

5 Things We Learned: UNO

Is two good goalies
really a good problem ?

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
1. The power play is emerging as
one of the nation's best.
Just two weeks ago in Michi-
gan's series against Michigan
Tech, the power play was doing
just fine. The Wolverines had
converted 25 percent of their
power-play chances heading into
Nebraska-Omaha but had netted
only one goal on the man advan-
tage since Oct.18.
That all took a turn for the bet-
ter when Michigan capitalized
on three of its eight power-play
opportunities this weekend, good
for a 38-percent success rate.
"It's funny because a lot of
them were broken plays," said
senior ; forward Andrew Copp.
"But the two (Friday), we ended
up hitting Moffatt in the middle
for a good play."
Boasting the fourth-best
power play in the nation - con-
verting on 11-of-40 opportunities
this season - the Wolverines'
offense now has something to
build off of after a slow start to
the season.
2. .T. Compher is finding his
groove.
The highly touted freshman
forward hadn't scored in any
games leading up to the weekend
series in Omaha but hit twine
twice to silence the critics.
To be clear, there wasn't much
skepticism about Compher's abil-
ities as a first-line center to begin
with. But this week after prac-
tice, some of his teammates jok-
ingly told him to talk to the media
about how he hasn't gotten his
first goal ina Michigan sweater.
Compher's first tally came off a
one-timer from the left circle late
in the second period in Friday's
loss. He had been working from
that spot in practice all week and
watched the puck fly into the top
corner tobreak his drought.
Compher is now second on the
team in points, tied with junior
forward Phil Di Giuseppe with
eight.

3. The defense was exposed for the first
time all season.

You could say Nebraska-
Omaha's explosive, speed-laden
offense was the reason Michi- '4$ &
gan's defense didn't look like a3
unit that's allowing just two goals
per game. Boasting one of the

OMAHA, Neb. -
T he members of the
Michigan hockey team
are doing what any good
teammates would do after split-

between that
of a broken record and a prere-
corded answering machine.
"We're definitely confident in
both of those guys, and I defi-
nitely think it's a huge bonus for
us to be confident in two guys,"
said sophomore forward Andrew
Copp.
Added senior forward Derek
DeBlois, "We know we have two'
great goalies that can come in and
win us games. It's a great situa-
tion to be in."
Earlier in the week, associate
head coach Billy Powers added:
"If the goalies can make it hard
on you, then that's a good prob-
lem."
But there's no need for it to be a
problem in the first place.
When Nagelvoort filled in
admirably after Racine suffered
a groin injury on Oct. 18 at New
Hampshire, the problem was
solved. It wasn't until almost a
month later, the week leading up
to the series against Nebraska-
Omaha, that Racine said he was
100-percent healthy.
. And now, Nagelvoort should
continue to start this season until
he gives his coaches a reason to
replace him. He may not be the

better of the two goalies, but he
does have the hotter hand, and at
this point in the season, it's neces-
sary to find consistency.
After all, the Wolverines have
almost always been a one-goalie
team - it's a strategy that worked
well enough to qualify for 22
consecutive NCAA Tourna-
ment appearances. It helps that
Michigan has had standouts like
Josh Blackburn, Marty Turco, Al
Montoya and Shawn Hunwick in
net, but they all had the spot to
themselves.
The Wolverines used a two-
goalie system three years ago,
when Berenson and the rest of the
coaching staff alternated Hun-
wick and Bryan Hogan between
the pipes until the Big Chill at the
Big House, when Berenson opted
to start Hogan.
If anything, the decision
proved to be more stressful than
effective for Hunwick. A junior at
the time, Hunwick felt the pres-
sure to win when he lost or keep
looking over his shoulder when
he did win.
"I've never really done well
when we are splitting like that,"
Hunwick said in an interview
two years ago during his senior
season. "I get a little bit too wor-
ried about the other guy, and all
that other stuff before worrying
about myself. I definitely was way
too nervous and worried about
Hogan way too much, how the
team was playing in front of him
and how they were playing in
front of me. It was hard for me
just to concentrate on the game
at hand."
But Hogan injured himself
before the game, so Hunwick
stepped in as a result. From that
game on, Hunwick continued to
play extremely well, even after
Hogan recovered.
Michigan rode Hunwick all
the way to a runner-up finish in
the NCAA Tournament later that
season.
Last season, the Wolverines
played three goalies throughout

the season. Michigan got off to
one of its worst starts in recent
program history and never recov-
ered until, you guessed it, it found
consistent goaltending.
If the system has worked so
well for so long, why change it up?
Nagelvoort allowed three
goals in Friday's loss, and Racine
allowed three goals the next
night ina win. Who's to say the
Wolverines couldn't have done
the same on Saturday in front of
Nagelvoort?
Berenson wanted to see his
original starter tested after his
absence, which of course makes
sense. But it helps when the
offense steps up, and the defense
prevents open looks.
It's not quite fair to replace
one goalie after a subpar perfor-
mance, especially after he has
posted a 1.47 goals-against aver-
age, a .947 save percentage and a
4-1-1 record prior to the weekend.
His performance would earn
him a starting job in almost any
other program. Even after his
worst performance statistically,
Nagelvoort still sits sixth nation-
ally among goaltenders in goals
allowed and save percentage.
Starting Nagelvoort allows him
to be more comfortable and find
consistency in arguablythe most
important position in hockey, on
top of helping his teammates do
the same.
Berenson can switch up the
two all he wants since both have
proved they're capable. But when
the season comes down to a do-
or-die game, and one needs to
stand out above the rest, Beren-
son will have to choose.
If it didn't work for one of the
best goalies in Michigan history,
why would it work for a true
freshman?

wins. So what?
This was a battle between
the Legends Division's bottom
dwellers, and it showed. Now, the
game hung in the balance on this
final drive of regulation. To start
it off, Gardner looked to Dileo.
His first reception went for six
yards.
He hurried back to the line as
the clock ticked away. The race
was on.
Only on big plays would Gib-
bons stop and watch. Back, back,
back, back. Right, right. Pause.
Now it was 4th and four, so
Gibbons looked up.
Gardner found Devin Funch-
ess. Michigan stayed alive. Gib-
bons resumed, striding over that

awkward divot.
Thump.
Dileo's struggles continued.
On the next play, Gardner threw
another pass Dileo's way, but it
was incomplete again. Two more
plays, and Michigan faced anoth-
er 4th and four.
Again, Funchess made the
reception. But now time had
become an issue.
Gardner was sacked for a loss
of 13 yards. The field goal would
be 60 yards from there, out of
range. Less than 30 seconds
remained. Another pass went
incomplete. Michigan needed
yards, but it also needed to stop
the clock, and it was third down
and no timeouts remained.
At some point, Matt Wile,

Michigan's long-distance kicker,
grabbed Gibbons and took him
near the line of scrimmage and
close to Michigan coach Brady
Hoke. Gardner flung a pass to
Jeremy Gallon. He caught it 16
yards down the field, inbounds.
Twelve seconds remained, and
counting.
Half the team was running off
the field and the field goal unit
was running on.
"Hurry, hurry up!" Gibbons
heard Hoke yell, as the coach
waved his hands. "Hurry up!"
And so he ran onto the field.
Dileo had run a route on the
opposite sideline, so he was the
farthest player from the line of
scrimmage. The line was just
about set, but Dileo, the holder,
was still on the wrong side of the
ball. Six seconds remained, then
five.

Michigan practices these hur-
ried field goals often. The team
runs them four or fives times
a week during fall camp, Hoke
said. Each Friday during the
season, it practices more. Hoke
counts down, and he counts fast.
Still, Hoke said he's never been
in a game situation this tight.
Now, the crowd counted down
for him
"Four!"
Rain had fallen steadily
throughout the second quarter,
and the field was muddy.
"Three!"
Dileo sprinted, and he needed
to stop, quick.
As Dileo ran, Gibbons started
his routine. Back, back...
"Two!"
There wasn't enough time.
Gibbons shuffled to a spot that
looked right. The field was slick
and divoted, and now, one more
obstacle: time.
For 59:48 this was a miserable,

meaningless game. But now the
win was achievable, and the side-
line buzzed. Michigan was play-
ing for their teammates and for
themselves and it didn't matter
what it was playing for because
it was playing to win. Still, the
Wolverines only had aprayer.
Dileo slid like a baseball player
does into second base. Gibbons
is a lefty, so Dileo was already on
the correct side. Now, kicker and
holder were together.
"One!"
Gibbons didn't even havea
chance to pause. Jareth Glanda
threw back the snap.
Soon, the rain picked up,
and the wind whipped up loose
objects and made it so loud that
you had to yell to the person next
to you. Michigan would dogpile
after three overtimes, victorious
27-19. Fans would crowd over the

stands lining the walkway next
to Michigan's locker room likea
canyon. Gallon and Gardner and
Taylor Lewan lingered there in
the driving rain, basking in the
feeling. Lewan disappeared into
the locker room, then reemerged
to give a sweatband toa young
child.
Hoke would say, "It might
be the best single play I've ever
seen. 'Cause it was a team play."
Michigan didn't need any--
thing extra to play for. There was
a game to be won. But Gibbons
still had to make the kick. The
routine had gone to hell. There
was another obstacle to dodge.
Dileo's slide stopped him at,
the right place.
Thump.
Gibbons knew it was good the
moment it left his foot.

ESCAPE
From Page 1B
been holding onto the ball for
too long while working with a
helpless offensive line, one of
the best athletes in the Big Ten
rendered ineffective by way of
brutality.
Northwestern dropped four
woald-be interceptions against
Gardner. Two of those likely
would have been returned for
touchdowns. Gardner ran for
jest 19 yards and completed 56
Tercent of his passes. He was by
no means perfect.
But at the end of the game, a
Northwestern player crouched
in the end zone, head down and
eyes closed before flinging his
helmet away. That was because
of Gardner.
On the last drive of overtime,
on 3rd and 23 with 16 seconds
left and no timeouts, he com-
pleted a sixteen-yard pass to
set up the game-tying field goal
from fifth-year senior kicker
Brendan Gibbons.
He threw the go-ahead
touchdown pass in the first
overtime, and then in triple
overtime, he faked an option
pitch and barreled through two
Wildcats for what would wind
up being the game-winning
touchdown. The two-point
conversion was finished by a
Gardner run, too, even though
it was a designed quarterback
run and Northwestern knew it
was coming.
"At that moment, you aren't
worn out," Gardner said. "If
you're worn out, you're not a
competitor. I gotta give it all I
got, and that's what I did."
Gardner looked like a com-
pletely different player once
the regulation clock turned off

and overtime rules were on the
table. With his back to the wall
and a fire of disappointment
licking at his heels, Gardner
made Michigan's season into
something salvageable.
"I don't know if there's any
one thing," Michigan coach
Brady Hoke said. "I wouldn't
think he was any more focused
or anything else, maybe he just
got into more of a rhythm."
Of course, none of this hap-
pens without a miracle field
goal at the end of regulation
that required a slide from hold-
er Drew Dileo and a conversion
from Gibbons on a wet, windy
field.
Without that, there are no
smiles or two-point conver-
sions. If Gardner leads Michi-
gan down the field but Gibbons
misses, it's a completely differ-
ent story.
But the hypothetical game
doesn't exist in college foot-
ball, so Gardner ran off the field
with his arms outstretched and
a grin on his face, ready to slap
hands with the fans who booed
this team a week ago. He took
their praise, took their congrat-
ulations, and ducked into the
locker room to sing The Victors.
Before heading to the media
room and after hugging his
family, he stopped for the group
of children. In unison, they
raised their hands. Some held
up one, some held up two. Gard-
ner slapped them all.
Walking into the media
room, where he would smile in
a press conference for the first
time in a while, Gardner heard
one of the children say, "That
was awesome! I got a high five
from.Devin Gardner!"
He turned around and
grinned. Being Devin Gardner
was fun again.

over once.
But that was largely because
Northwestern dropped four
would-be interceptions.And when
it counted, Michigan often came
up short. There was the failure to
capitalize on the short punt. And
then on the next drive, Michigan
went for it on a fourth-and-two
instead of kicking the game-tying
field goal. Gardner ran the ball on
a keeper. He lost ayard.
"Well we wanna score more,"
said Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
"But I think everyone in the coun-
try wants to score more. But I like
how we ran the ball. That's the
first time I guess we were in posi-
tive yardage. That's the first time
in three weeks, so we'll take that."
2. The kids are alright.
Fitzgerald Toussaint stood on
the sideline Saturday, his helmet
in hand. For about two and a half
seasons now, Toussaint has been
the Michigan football team's pre-
ferred choice at running back.
But now the fifth-year senior
watched as two true freshmen
took the snaps that usually go to
him. Hobbled with an unspeci-
fied injury, Toussaint was unable
to practice for much of the week,
according to Hoke. He didn't play
a single snap. Hoke said he held
him out of the game because he
didn't get enough work in practice.
Instead, Green and De'Veon
Smith shared every carry from the
tailback position. Together, they
totaled 120 yards on 27 carries. It
was Michigan's first game in posi-
tive rushing yardage in the last
three weeks.
Green got the start and the bulk
of the carries, but Smith rushed

just as well. He averaged 5.1 yards
per carry on eight rushes - the
highest average from a Michigan
running back except for Green's
5.3 yards per carry in the season
opener. Toussaint's highest aver-
age was 5.0 against Connecticut.
Hoke said Toussaint will still
the be the starter moving forward,
but the Wolverines finally saw
some life from its young rushers.
3. Found: Pass rush.
Michigan has been searching
for a pass rush all year, and it may
have finally found the right combi-
nation. Senior Jibreel Black,junior
Frank Clark and freshman Taco
Charlton pressured each of North-
western's quarterbacks for much
of the game.
The Wolverines finished with
two sacks, but the pass rush
showed life and collapsed the
pocket often. On one play, Clark
beat his lineman with a spin move,
but he was unable to get the sack.
Still, the pressure forced a quick
throw and an incompletion.
"We're trying out new stuff,"
said Black, the only defensive line-
man with a sack Saturday. "We're
not going to get it right away. And I
feel like we're really starting to jell
together."
4. Dileo is a good base runner.
Gardner ran off the field so
quickly on the final play of regu-
lation that he missed the last-
second, 44-yard field goal from
fifth-year senior Brendan Gib-
bons. That meantS he also missed
fifth-year senior Drew Dileo's
rather unusual hold.
After the game, Gardner said,
"A lot of guys were in the locker
room talking about, 'Did you see
Dileo?'
"I was like, 'He's the holder,

TERESA MATHEW/Daily
Redshirtjunior Devin Gardner led Michigan to an overtime win on Saturday.

what do you mean did I see Dileo?'
What he missed was a play
more often seen in baseball. Dileo
was the furthest player from the
line ofscrimmage, so he had to run
to get back for the snap. With awet
field, Dileo slid like a base runner
to stop himself at the right spot.
In fact, Dileo was a talented
baseball player in high school,
winning three varsity letters and
two Louisiana state champion-
ships. For Michigan, that paid off.

5. Bold Prediction: Derrick Green
will get more carries than Fitzger-
ald Toussaint for the rest of the
season.
Toussaint is still the presumed
starter, but Green showed promise
on Saturday. At this point, is he a
better option that Toussaint? It's
close.
But Green is the running back
of the future. My guess is Michi-
gan will work on his development.

4B - November 18, 201-

in loss, a silver lining: McGary

By SIMON KAUFMAN*
Daily Sports Writer
AMES, Iowa - With 16:17
remaining in the first half, Mich-
igan basketball fans rejoiced
as sophomore forward Mitch
McGary entered the game for the
Wolverines to make his season
debut.
At the 14:50 mark, Michigan
coach John Beilein nodded his
head as McGary went up for a
defensive rebound and came
back down with the ball in his
hands - a familiar sight for the
big inan who averaged more than
six rebounds per game last year.
A little more than two min-
utes later, the Wolverines' bench
stood up when McGary put up
an offensive rebound for his first
points of the season, then fol-
lowed it up 18 seconds later with
a steal and finish on the other
end.
With 11:5 on the clock in the
first-half, McGary fell backward
while trying to make a defensive
play. He lay on his back - the
back that until Sunday night had
been injured and kept him side-
lined this year - and for just a
moment, Michigan waited. The
6-foot-10 forward shot up his
hands, but not in pain, and he
reached for the hands of team-
mates who pulled him up.
McGary stood up, and the
maize and blue breathed a collec-
tive sigh of relief- a little longer
this time, a little more stress-
free.
Before the season started,
the country was told to keep its
eyes on McGary. He was one
of five players named to the
AP preseason All-American
team, and on Sunday night in
Michigan's game against Iowa
State, McGary found out that
the country listened to the pre-
season predictions - he was a
target. He endured tough physi-
cal defense, and perhaps an even
,more grueling assault of verbal
abuse thrashed out by the stu-
dent section at Hilton Coliseum
where lowa State (3-0) upset No.
7 Mchigan, 77-70.
"They have great fans. It's a
little shaky when they single out
one person," McGary said.
The insults didn't seem to faze
him, but his presence alone on
the court couldn't propel Michi-
gan toward a win in its first road

Sophomore forward Mitch McGary made his season debut after sitting out the first two games of the year with a back injury,

game of the season. It did, how-
ever, allow for a sneak peek of
what's to come from the Ches-
terton, Ind. native in his second
year. ,
Michigan (2-1) 'started the
game with the same lineup it had
used in its first two games, but
McGary came in early to replace
redshirt junior forward Jon Hor-
ford who has started at center
in McGary's absence. He made
a quick impact, putting in eight
points in the first'half.
McGary had only one point
in the second half, but still he
brought elements to the game
that Horford and fifth-year
senior forward Jordan Morgan
simply cannot. He scrapped for
tough rebounds, fighting off sev-
eral Cyclones by himself around
the rim, and came up with four
steals, grabbing and clawing at
Iowa State players with the ball.
"It was great to be back,"

McGary said. "(I'm) just trying to
find the chemistry on the court.
It's difficult in the first game."
Some parts of McGary's game
did look rusty. He struggled
at times to keep up with the
Cyclone's fast pace and his tim-
ing on offense appeared delayed
- all byproducts of not having
played at game speed since April.
"Now he's got to get into shape
to be able to play," Beilein said.
"The bigs can't play for more
than three to four minutes any-
how because of the fact of how
busy the game is for bigs right
now. So he'll go in, and he'll go
out, but the timing is the thing
that he's got to work on now."
Certainly, this is a different
Michigan team with McGary
healthy. If he's able to adjust
his timing and show the same
dominance that brought him
the spotlight during his perfor-
mance in the NCAA Tournament

last season, he'll quickly learn to
embrace being the target.

letter word preceding it.
"It was alittle shakywhen they
single out one person," McGary
said about the crowd. "But they
got a good atmosphere."
Down the stretch, an inability
to secure the ball doomed Michi-
gan. Passes were tipped, dribbles
were interrupted, and even if the
Wolverines retained possession,
their rhythm was thrown off,
and they couldn't get open shots.
Sophomore guard Nik Staus-
kas did what he could to keep the
Wolverines in it. With no clear
option on the team to make the
difficult shot, Stauskas seemed
ready to take the responsibility.
He led the team with 20 points
and six assists.
With sophomore wings Glenn
Robinson III and Caris LeVert
struggling to find the basket,
Michigan coach John Beilein
started to call plays for Stauskas.
"Mitch had just one full prac-
tice under his belt," Beilein said.
"Glenn was not having his best
day. He'll have better days ahead
of him. So Nik had the hot hand,
it made sense. We'd do the same
thing if Glenn had the hot hand

that guys nor-
mally make. So we're not going to
be to worried about it. Hopefully
next game those shots go down
for us."
After the Iowa State lead
advanced to 69-63, Stauskas
tried to bring Michigan back
with an off-balance 3-point make
and a nifty bounce pass to assis
a Robinson layup, but the offense
came to ahalt there.
Down five, Robinson missed
a 3-pointer and after a Staus-
kas offensive rebound, LeVert
missed another one. The
Cyclones would close the game
out from the free-throw line, and
then the Cyclone faithful would
spill onto the court.
Fans danced, they held up
signs. Iowa State coach Fred
Hoiberg cracked jokes after-
wards, and the home players left
smiling.
It was an occasionto celebrate,
and Michigan was unlucky to be
excluded from the afterparty.
"It was an awesome environ-
ment for anyone that loves the
game of basketball," Stauskas
said. "I think both teams had a
lot of fun out there."
