Joe Palca, an award-winning 

science 
correspondent 
from 

National Public Radio, visited 
the University of Michigan 
Thursday afternoon to give a 
talk 
titled 
“Communicating 

Science for Fun and Profit” at 
West Hall. The talk focused 
on how to better communicate 
science with the general public.

Palca, who has worked for 

NPR since 1992, has covered 
a large range of science news, 
such 
as 
the 
new 
genome 

editing technology and the first 
snapshots of Jupiter’s north 
pole. He used his previously 
written stories as examples to 
illustrate several points, like 
the low scientific literacy of the 
U.S. population. According to a 
survey in 2013, just 58 percent 
of 18- to 29-year-olds answered 
correctly that carbon dioxide is 
the gas associated with climate 
change.

Palca said he constantly asks 

himself what he can expect his 
audience to know. Using his 
recent article on Jupiter’s north 
pole as an example, he explained 
how scientific research always 
has jargon, like “aurora” — 
lights caused by the interaction 
between particles from the sun 
and the Earth’s magnetic field. 
Palca said, as a writer, he needs 
to first understand the jargon 
to translate it into simpler 
language.

“There is always a certain 

amount of jargon,” he said. 

“Now, aurora — people don’t 
really, really know what aurora 
was. I had to go and look it up 
and remind myself what an 
aurora was. And I certainly 
didn’t explain why there are 
poles (on Jupiter) and why 
magnetic fields come together at 
poles. … I tried to, in the piece, 
keep the simplest words I can.”

He also spoke of his efforts 

to portray scientists as people, 
not as “body of brains” [COPY: a 

body of brains? Bodies of brains? 
Plural bc we’re talking about 
scientists] without passion or 
interest who sleep in the lab or at 
their computer. To illustrate the 
human side of scientists, Palca 
pointed to comments made by 
several competing scientists he 
interviewed who said though 
they would be happy for anyone 
to discover the ninth planet, 
they would be happier if they 
were the ones who find it first.

“Scientists have said, ‘look 

it’s not about me, it’s about my 
science,’ ” Palca said. “You can 
say that to other scientists when 
you’re talking to them, but when 
you’re on the radio and you’re 
talking to me, it’s about you. I 
think people respond to people.”

Finally, Palca said while 

there are many new findings 
in science covered by media, 
they are not necessarily the 

The Trotter Multicultural 

Center kicked off the year 
with its A Peace of Trotter 
event, which offered a variety 
of global activities Thursday 
evening.

The 
event 
featured 
an 

assortment 
of 
international 

cuisine, yoga on the lawn, 
Congolese dancing and Paint 
No Pour — a program based 
off Painting with a Twist, a 
painting studio that includes 
in class instruction, without 
alcohol 
or 
other 
altering 

substances.

The 
activities 
were 
all 

led by various members of 
the University of Michigan 
community, 
including 

professors, faculty and staff.

Program Manager Jessica 

Thompson said she wanted 
this event to demonstrate what 
students can expect from the 
Trotter Center for the rest 
of the year. Looking ahead, 
Thompson said Trotter will 
continue to host its regular 
events — like Paint No Pour, 
Soul Food Sundays and Congo 
dancing lessons — in addition

The City of Ann Arbor is 

working to develop a new long-
term plan recycling in the city 
after being sued by the city’s 
former 
recycling 
operator, 

ReCommunity.

Currently, recycling in the 

city is being managed by a 
short-term 
operator 
put 
in 

place to temporarily continue 
recycling services while an 
interim company is found.

On 
July 
27, 
Resource 

Recovery Systems LLC and 
FCR LLC, better known as 
ReCommunity, filed a federal 
lawsuit against the city of Ann 

Arbor 
alleging 
a 
wrongful 

termination of its contract. 
ReCommunity says the city 
violated terms of its contract 
by failing to pay the costs of 
revenue shortfalls and repairs, 
and used wrongful means to end 
the contract when it saw it as no 
longer financially beneficial.

The city of Ann Arbor 

alleges 
the 
contract 
was 

terminated 
due 
to 
safety 

concerns and a multitude of 
fires at ReCommunity plants. 
ReCommunity 
managed 

the city’s Material Recovery 
Facility on Platt Road, as well as 
the city’s recycling facility and 
transfer station.

University President Mark Schlissel listens to speakers at the regents meeting at the Michigan Union Thursday.

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents held its first 
meeting of the academic year 
Thursday afternoon, passing 
measures including a pay raise 

for University President Mark 
Schlissel, new renovations and 
new bylaws concerning student 
input on the board’s decisions, 
along with the announcement 
of a new robotics laboratory.

New renovations to Dental 

Building, Kraus Building and 
LSA Building

The board approved a $122 

million renovation project to 
the W.K. Kellogg Institute and 
Dental building. The repairs 
will cover 172,000 square feet 
of the current buildings and 
add 37,000 square feet to the 
complex, addressing concerns 
such as patient accessibility 

and 
deferred 
maintenance. 

Upon approval by the state 
legislature, $30 million will 
come from the state, while the 
Office of the Provost will front 
the remaining cost. The board 
also authorized architecture 
firm SmithGroupJJR to oversee

The University of Michigan’s 

Monitoring the Future survey 
announced last week that they 
found college-aged adults’ use 
of marijuana has continued to 
steadily increase since 1975, 
while the rate of “being drunk” 
has held at near 60 percent 
prevalence level since 2000.

Lloyd Johnston, the study’s 

principal investigator and a 
senior research scientist at the 
Institute for Social Research, 
said 
alcohol, 
marijana, 

narcotics and cigarettes are 
among the most frequently 
used substances on campus. 

Alcohol
Johnston said one of the 

more significant and relevant 
facets of the study is its focus 
on alcohol use among college 
students, a demographic which 
often drinks in excess in short 
periods of time.

Johnston said the numbers 

on alcohol use are concerning, 
“particularly for people who 
are binge drinking and doing

binge drinking, which is very 
dangerous — having 10 or 15

RESEARCH

University survey shows 
trends in college drug 
and alcohol use

ALEXA ST. JOHN
Daily Staff Reporter


 

The University of Michigan 

received 
a 
$3.9 
million 

grant 
from 
the 
National 

Institue of Health to fund its 
musculoskeletal 
research, 
a 

program which involves several 
schools including the School of 
Dentistry, the School of Public 
Health and LSA on Aug. 30.

Musculoskeletal 
work 

involves the way the muscles, 
skeleton, tendons and more 
relate to one another and work 
together.

The grant funds will be 

utilized 
by 
the 
Michigan 

Integrative 
Musculoskeletal 

Health 
Core 
Center 
— 
a 

program which combines all of 
the musculoskeletal research 
being done at the University by 
researchers across a variety of 
fields. It centralizes certain ideas 

for testing, such as how strong 
one’s bones or muscles are, so 
that the money will be utilized 
by researchers across a variety 
of 
departments 
conducting 

musculoskeletal research.

Core 
Center 
Director 

Karl 
Jepsen, 
professor 
and 

associate chair of research in 
the Department of Orthopaedic 
Surgery, said the interest in 
musculoskeletal 
research 
is 

massive at the University.

“In 
every 
corner 
of 
the 

campus, someone has some 
sort of interest in bone, muscle, 
tendon, ligament, cartilage,” he 
said.

For example, he said, the 

Dentistry School is interested 
in tissue regeneration, while 
the 
College 
of 
Engineering 

is interested in orthopedics. 
The field also includes a lot of 
research in aging and ways to 
stay fit.

“Michigan 
really 
pushes 

the boundaries for integrated 
research,” Jepsen said. “A lot 
of research that is going on is 
funded at a single, investigated 
level tend to be very reductionist. 
People who study bone will only 
study bone. People who study 
muscle will only study muscle.”

Jepsen said what is missing 

from the field is people who 
study the interactions between 
bone and muscle. The Core 
Center allows the study of that 
intersection, 
pushing 
those 

boundaries 
to 
study 
these 

interactions.

Susan 
Brooks, 
associate 

director of the Core Center 
and professor of molecular and 
integrative physiology, wrote 
in an email interview that the 
Core Center uses the diverse 
schools within the University 
to advance its research beyond 
what would have been possible 

in an individual’s laboratory 
and works to bridge different 
fields.

“It is a major challenge to 

track down the knowledge 
that one needs at such a large 
institution,” she wrote. “This 
Core Center will facilitate 
bringing people in contact 
with the expertise that they 
need, and perhaps didn’t even 
know existed on campus.” 

Jepsen and Brooks both 

expressed that they hope the 
research done with the grant 
funds will push for change in 
the musculoskeletal research.

“The result, we hope, will 

be to increase the impact of 
the collective activities of basic 
scientists, clinicians, engineers 
to improve musculoskeletal 
health 
throughout 
the 

lifespan,” Brooks wrote.

Jepsen said the NIH was 

very interested in the ways the 
program was bringing people 
together.

“We had an opportunity to 

create an impact on the field,” 
he said.

On June 10, 2016, the city 

gave ReCommunity notice that 
if perceived safety concerns 
continued, the city reserved the 
right to terminate the contract. 
On 
July 
7, 
ReCommunity 

was given a letter informing 
them their contract would be 
terminated effective July 11.

On Sept. 2, the city responded 

to the lawsuit with a motion for 
partial dismissal and a motion 
requesting extended time to 
answer complainants. Lazarus 
was unable to comment on 

questions relating directly to the 
lawsuit. 

Since 
January 
2016, 
the 

city has been working with 
consultants 
from 
energy 

infrastructure company CB&I to 
develop a new plan for recycling 
in Ann Arbor. City Administrator 
Howard Lazarus wrote in an 
email to the Daily on Wednesday 
that the development of that plan 
is still in progress.

“CB&I 
is 
under 
contract 

with the city to assist in the 
development 
of 
a 
long-term 

approach to recycling, including 
addressing 
composting 
of 

organics and recommendations 
for physical modifications to our 
MRF,” Lazarus said.

Ann Arbor is currently on 

the search for a more long-term 
interim operator to take over 
while it continues development 
of long-term ideas with CB&I.

“The 
city 
is 
currently 

soliciting a contract for an 
interim operator. The responses 
are due back at the end of 
September,” Lazarus said. “We 
anticipate an interim operational 
period of 12 to 18 months, during 
which time we will develop a 
long-term approach to recycling 
of materials for the city of Ann 
Arbor.”

Sean Duffy, ReCommunity 

president and chief operating 
officer, did not respond to a 
request for comment.

Regents approve new robotics 
lab for School of Engineering

‘U’ to partner with Ford Motor Company on project

Thursday, the University of 

Michigan’s Board of Regents 
approved 
an 
estimated 

$75 
million 
new 
robotics 

laboratory, 
made 
possible 

through a leasing partnership 
with Ford Motor Company, 
that will be used as a research 
lab and teaching space for the 
College of Engineering.

Ford will use the fourth 

floor of the lab to conduct its 
own research, an agreement 
to 
allow 
for 
collaboration 

between 
University 

engineering students and Ford 
researchers.

The new lab will include 

offices for 30 faculty members 

and more than 100 graduate 
students 
and 
postdoctoral 

researchers.

The amount of funding from 

Ford will be determined by the 
final cost of the project but 
will not exceed $22,822,909. 
Under the lease, Ford will pay 
for expenses incurred during 
the lab’s use and adhere to 
University 
rules 
regarding 

use.

Upon 
completion, 
the 

University will join a small 
group of colleges that have 
a robot-specific laboratory. 
Unique to the University, 
however, is the new lab’s 
close proximity to Mcity, a 
test facility for driverless 
cars.

The lab will be on the 

northeast 
corner 
of 
the 

University’s North Campus. 
Construction is expected to 
be completed by winter 2020.

Engineering 
prof. 
Jessy 

Grizzle 
noted 
that 
the 

University will be one of the 
only universities that offers 
both learning and hands-
on application in the field of 
robotics.

“Many places with strong 

robotics 
reputations 
are 

computer science-dominated 
and they don’t test their 
theories on machines to the 
extent that we do,” Grizzle 
said in a press release. “At 
UM, most of our faculty 
members have an in-house 
robot. We put our algorithms 
in motion.”

to more spontaneous events 
depending 
on 
the 
needs 

reflected by students.

“What I wanted was for us 

to create the experience for 
all of our students, kind of the 
way in which we will show up 
all school year,” she said. “I 
wanted to give them a little 
taste of what we offer.”

Thompson added that her 

goal this year for the Trotter 
Center 
is 
to 
expand 
its 

outreach to all students and 
groups.

“I want to create those 

experiences 
where 
we 

are 
fostering 
stronger 

connections,” she said. “We 
are absolutely thinking about 
the communities who we have 
not yet reached and making 
sure the campus as a whole 
knows that we are a space for 
everyone.”

Social Work student Noran 

Alsabahi, who attended the 
event, said Trotter is a place 
she 
finds 
welcoming 
and 

where she enjoys spending her 
time.

“I love Trotter,” she said. 

“Trotter is basically a home 
away from home. It’s a safe 
place to be in; it’s a fun place 
to be in, a warm place to be in. 
I want to be here as much as 
possible.”

Medical 
School 
student 

Michael Bourke said he met 
many 
friends 
through 
the 

center the previous year, which 
motivated him to return.

“I came last year, and they 

had really good food,” he said. 
“By that I got involved in a lot 
of the Friday programs they 
have here and met a lot of my 
friends here, so I wanted to 
come back this year.”

Public 
Health 
student 

Wenwen Jiang said she had 
attended the Trotter Center’s 
final event of the semester last 
year and wanted to return.

“I saw the event on the 

Umich website, and I thought 

it might be interesting,” she 
said. “I went here last semester 
… and it was pretty great so I 
tried this time again to see if 
this looks fun to me and if I 
want to go for it.”

most interesting or important. 
For example, Andre Geim and 
Konstantin Novoselov, who won 
the Nobel Prize in Physics in 
2010, first published their study 
on graphene — a material that 
has the thickness of one carbon 
atom and has unique properties 
enabling scientists to test several 
fundamental theories in physics 
— in 2004. According to Palca, 
only a few, small news outlets did 

a story on the study that year. It 
was not until Geim and Nobeselov 
received the Nobel Prize in 2010 
that more mainstream news 
outlets covered the story.

Palca’s latest efforts to address 

such issues has culminated into 
Joe’s Big Idea, a special series he 
said focuses on interesting and 
important 
scientific 
research 

rather than the latest trend.

Rackham 
student 
Midhat 

Farooq said she attended the talk 
because invited speakers are not 
usually from outside the world 
of academia. She said she even 

forwarded the event information 
to the rest of the physics graduate 
students.

“I think it would encourage 

the department to do more 
things like this if there’s a better 
turnout,” she said.

Farooq said she especially 

liked the format of Palca’s talk, 
which was different from what 
academic speakers usually use.

“(Palca) 
stood 
up 
and 

told stories, and it was very 
communicative 
with 
the 

audience instead of him giving a 
slideshow,” she said.

drinks in a row.”

Though the study revealed 

alcohol use among college 
students has faced a sharp 
decline 
between 
1991 
and 

2000, the rate of having “been 
drunk” has remained steadily 
near the 60 percent prevalence 
level in more recent years. For 
lifetime use, the percentage is 
closer to 70 percent.

“In college we see about one 

in every nine college students 
indicate that in the past two 
weeks — two weeks before the 
survey — that they had had 10 
or more drinks in a row at least 
once,” Johnston said.

This 
nationwide 
trend 

increase seems to have been 
reflected in the number of 
alcohol-related offenses on the 
University campus in recent 
years. There were 515 incidents 
regarding illegal possession 
or use of alcohol in the 2013-
2014 school year, compared 
to 490 incidents in the year 
prior, according to the Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution 
annual report.

Johnston did not attribute 

the high rate of alcohol usage to 
any new developments, socially 
or otherwise. However, he said 
he has noticed a narrowing 
gap in alcohol consumption 
between males and females.

“Drinking 
and 
heavy 

drinking 
have 
been 

characteristic 
of 
American 

universities for a long time,” 
Johnston said. “There hasn’t 
been a lot of change in the 
drinking 
rates, 
except 
a 

little decrease over a long 
period of time among males 
but practically none among 
females. 
What’s 
happened 

actually is females have gotten 
close to catching up to their 
male 
counterparts 
in 
the 

amount that they drink.”

Marijuana
According to the report, 

college 
students’ 
use 
of 

marijuana 
has 
increased 

steadily since the survey’s 
initiation in 1975. More than 

50.4 percent of respondents 
reported using the drug in 
2015, a 4.1 percent increase 
since the survey’s inception.

In addition to an overall 

increase in use, Johnston also 
noted a rise in the daily use of 
marijuana. College student and 
young adult levels of daily use 
showed an increase of almost 
1 percent from 2007 to 2015, 
from 5.1 percent to 6 percent, 
respectively.

Johnston attributed both 

spikes to cultural shifts in 
perception 
and 
nationwide 

policy changes.

“With 
marijuana, 
the 

perception of risk has gone 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction 

(from 
narcotics),” 
he said. 

“We’ve seen a big drop in the 
proportion of college students 
or people their age who see 
even heavy marijuana use as 
risky.”

Johnston said the increase 

in public discussion about 
the advantages of medical 
marijuana has aligned with 
perceptions that the substance 
is less dangerous — an idea 
that he noted has not yet been 
confirmed due to a lack of 
long-term data on the topic.

There has been much debate 

surrounding the legalization 
of marijuana, along with its 
associated 
health 
effects 

nationwide.

One 
recent 
study 
from 

the University has indicated 
marijuana 
can 
negatively 

affect neurological responses 
such as pleasure, memory, 
judgment and coordination. 
However, 
some 
medical 

experts recommend marijuana 
— at least for medical use — 
due to its pain relieving and 
side-effect reducing qualities, 
according to the University 
Health System website

Johnston 
suggested 
that 

perhaps as more long-term data 
is accumulated — much like 
how cigarettes were found to 
be dangerous only after years 
of collecting usage data — more 
of the health consequences 
surrounding 
marijuana 
use 

will be established.

Narcotics
Johnston said in the past, 

perceived risk for narcotics 
has been relatively low among 
high school and college-aged 
populations. However, these 
perceptions have changed as 
college-aged adults recognize 
greater risk, according to the 
study — a trend that Johnston 
noted is particularly beneficial 
both in the short and long run.

“The fact that these two 

groups are not (using narcotics 
heavily) is important because 
they are not currently putting 
themselves at risk and because, 
as they grow older and replace 
the 
older 
generation, 
the 

less likely they’ll be carrying 
with them a narcotic habit,” 
Johnston said.

He said he believes this 

decline 
in 
narcotics 
use 

among young adults is likely 
due to social movements and 
news outlets outlining more 
sensationalized 
cases 
of 

overdose.

“Narcotics have been getting 

a lot of national press related 
to increase in overdose deaths 
and so I think that probably 
has 
influenced 
people’s 

willingness to use narcotics,” 
Johnston said.

Cigarettes 
The study also revealed a 

significant shift in cigarette 
usage among college students. 
Smoking among the young 
adult subgroup dropped to 17 
percent in 2015 from its recent 
peak of 31 percent in 1998.

One 
caveat 
Johnston 

mentioned was a discrepancy 
between the rate of cigarette 
smoking 
among 
college 

students 
and 
the 
rate 

of 
smoking 
among 
their 

unenrolled same-age peers. He 
found a dramatic difference 
between the two populations, 
highlighting 
more 
frequent 

smoking tendencies in the 
latter demographic.

“The change in cigarette 

smoking 
has 
been 
very 

substantial, 
particularly 

among 
college 
students,” 

Johnston 
said. 
“That, 
of 

course, bodes well for their 
future health and longevity, 
and for their present budget, 
since 
smoking 
is 
a 
very 

expensive habit.”

the project.

Repairs and remodeling of 

the Kraus Building and the 
first floor of the LSA Building 
approved Thursday will cost 
an estimated $120 million and 
$35 million, respectively. The 
LSA building will be renovated 
to 
house 
the 
new 
LSA 

Opportunity hub, a center for 
LSA internships and strategic 
advising.

“Our goal is to help students 

more

explore 
their 

interests and passions, and 
to give them an even greater 
advantage 
to 
thrive 
after 

graduation in work and in life,” 
LSA Dean Andrew D. Martin 
told the University Record.

Donations
Jerry May, vice president of 

development at the University, 
announced 
the 
University 

received $440 million this past 
fiscal year in cash gifts, the 
most the University has ever 
received in cash donations. 
May attributed this success 
to President Schlissel and the 
regents.

He also announced that the 

University is 87.5 percent to its 
fundraising goal for this fiscal 
year, and expects to go well 
past their goal. He said the 
University plans to allocate 
extra resources to other needs 
of the University.

May also noted that student 

support 
is 
high 
compared 

to 
previous 
years, 
saying 

students have donated about 
$609 million, both in cash and 
pledges to be received within 
the next five years. Giving 

Blueday, an annual day of 
giving that will be held for the 
third time this year, has helped 
the University acquire more 
young alumni donors.

“This is the first time we 

have had students actively 
engage in fundraising,” May 
said of the event.

Students pledged $1 million 

of their own money and raised 
$3 billion from others during 
last year’s Giving Blueday and 
events centered around it.

CSG committee report
David 
Schafer, 
Central 

Student Government president, 
spoke to the board about CSG’s 
policy initiatives for this year. 
These included implementing 
safety precautions on game 
day, addressing the cost of off 
campus housing, dedicating 
more resources to student 
mental health and recognizing 
diversity throughout student 
groups on campus.

For the past two Saturdays, 

CSG has partnered with the 
Panhellenic Association, the 
Interfraternity Council and 
LSA student government to 
put hydration stations at high 
risk areas. Schafer reported 
that they served more than 
5,000 students water over 
the two game days. students 
water. CSG has also partnered 
with MDining to open South 
Quad Dining Hall at 8 a.m. 
on Saturday, allowing 865 
students 
to 
swipe 
in 
for 

breakfast 
between 
8 
a.m. 

and 9 a.m. This Saturday, 
CSG will additionally host an 
alternative tailgate with pizza 
and water.

Schafer 
also 
told 
the 

board that CSG is starting 
discussions with Ann Arbor 

City Council and committee 
officials about the potential 
rise in off-campus housing 
costs, especially in light of the 
approval of a new high-rise on 
East University Avenue.

“This issue of increasingly 

costly 
off-campus 
housing 

affects 
everyone,” 
Schafer 

said.

He 
also 
thanked 
the 

administration 
for 
its 

continued 
support 
in 

improving student access to 
mental health services and 
increasing both CAPS funding 
and staffing, saying CSG plans 
to release student surveys 
on the issue sometime this 
October.

“Once we collect data, we 

expect to reconvene to decide 
how to move forward,” he 
said. “We hope to best match 
student needs with policy 
initiatives.”

Additionally, Schafer urged 

the regents to reinstate bylaw 
7.1 
to 
incorporate 
student 

voices in the decision-making 
process. The regents voted to 
do so later in the meeting.

T

oday, 
in 
many 
households 

throughout the Bay Area, football 
jerseys are being 

set aflame. This is not 
necessarily 
an 
earth-

shattering 
revelation 

for avid sports fans, as 
a 
good-ol’-fashioned 

jersey 
burning 
has 

become an off-season 
staple in recent years, 
a tradition akin to a 
bonfire in the fall. But 
this is a unique case. 
The 
passion 
of 
this 

situation 
runs 
even 

deeper than the vitriol that the city of 
Cleveland displayed in 2010 when Lebron 
James decided to take his talents to South 
Beach. This is not a city reacting to the 
scorn of a jilted lover; rather, this is an act 
that has transcended even the ironclad 
bonds of team loyalty and penetrated the 
core of our collective patriotism, leading 
many to question what it means to be an 
American.

On Aug. 26, San Francisco 49ers’ 

quarterback 
Colin 

Kaepernick 
refused 
to 

stand during the national 
anthem 
performed 
at 

a 
preseason 
football 

game against the Green 
Bay 
Packers. 
Instead, 

Kaepernick 
elected 
to 

sit as a peaceful protest 
to what he views as the 
unfair treatment of African 
Americans in this country. 
“I am not going to stand up 
to show pride in a flag for 
a country that oppresses 
Black people and people of 
color,” Kaepernick claimed 
after the game.

This statement immediately generated 

immense backlash and led to many people 
criticizing Kaepernick as un-American and 
ignorant. They insisted that the refusal 
to stand was an insult to members of the 
armed forces. While the quarterback did 
receive support from many of his fellow 
NFL players, some of whom have since 
adopted similar pregame gestures, he also 
took into consideration the opinions of his 
critics.

After 
speaking 
with 
former 
Staff 

Sgt. Green Beret and current NFL long 
snapper Nate Boyer, Kaepernick has since 
decided to kneel during the anthem as 
a show of respect to military tradition. 
Despite this compromise, the criticism has 
only intensified, as many groups like the 
Santa Clara Police Officers’ Association 
have expressed their displeasure with 
Kaepernick’s actions.

Both sides of this debate have had 

powerful reactions. There is no doubt that 
the men and women of our armed forces 
deserve more thanks and respect than we 
as a nation could ever give them, and I am 
aware of the fact that issues pertaining 
to patriotism and national pride are very 
emotional ones. At the same time, it’s hard 
not to see the irony in a peaceful protest 
being deemed as “un-American” or that 
the person participating in it should be 
considered ignorant for doing so.

The truth is that peaceful protests 

are every bit as American as apple pie. 
For generations they have served as a 
fundamental tool in the American citizen’s 

arsenal 
of 
democracy, 
bringing 
about 

change and sparking important national 
discussions on topics such as race, gender 
and the right to unionize.

In fact, the history of the state of 

Michigan is deeply intertwined with 
that of the peaceful protest. One of the 
first sit-down strikes in the history 
of America occurred in 1936, in Flint, 
when autoworkers peacefully protested 
against General Motors and eventually 
gained recognition of the United Auto 
Workers as bargainers for GM’s employees. 
Furthermore, here at the University of 
Michigan, the first teach-in in history was 
held in 1965 to protest the war in Vietnam. 
These events are two of the most important 
actions in the history of our state, and still 
only represent a fraction of our nation’s 
many great peaceful protests.

Despite the prominence of these protests 

throughout history, there has been a strange 
tendency by the media to treat this type of 
action as some unheard-of occurrence, 
when in reality this situation is not even 
entirely new to the sports world. From a 
historical perspective, Kaepernick has 

some very distinguished 
company. In his 1972 
autobiography “I Never 
Had It Made,” Jackie 
Robinson — one of the 
most iconic heroes in 
the history of American 
sports (and a former 
member of the armed 
forces himself ) — stated 
plainly, “I cannot stand 
and sing the anthem. I 
cannot salute the flag; 
I know that I am a black 
man in a white world.”

These 
words 
came 

from 
a 
man 
who 

experienced the evils of racism firsthand on 
his way to breaking baseball’s color barrier. 
While great strides have certainly been 
made since Robinson’s time, turning the 
news on just about any given day provides 
a sobering reminder that his statement still 
rings true today. There may be a Black man 
in the White House, but this is still a white 
world. With this in mind, it is important 
that we have a true, open discussion about 
the realities of racism in this country, and 
Kaepernick has helped to reenergize this 
conversation through the nonstop media 
coverage that has surrounded his protest.

While his actions have rubbed many 

people the wrong way, part of the beauty 
of being American citizens is that we have 
freedom of speech, and as a result we are 
often forced to deal with situations that 
make us uncomfortable. As individuals, we 
rarely grow in situations in which we are 
comfortable, and I believe that this goes the 
same for our society as a whole. In my eyes, 
the tensions and disagreements that our 
society is currently facing are signs that we 
are on the precipice of progress.

While Kaepernick’s critics may not agree 

with his actions, I certainly hope that they 
will respect his right to speak his mind and 
will make an earnest attempt to understand 
the position that he is coming from. 
Kaepernick is continuing a long tradition 
of peacefully pushing for much-needed 
changes in society, and there are few things 
more American than that. 

—Jeff Brooks can be reached 

at brooksjs@umich.edu. I 

live in an apartment in 
a 
subdivided 
house 
in 

Kerrytown — which is to say 

that 
despite 

the 
slanted 

floor and lead 
paint 
(I 
had 

to 
promise 

my 
mom 
I 

wouldn’t chew 
on the window 
sills), 
the 

amenities are 
surprisingly 
good.

The 
house 

must’ve 
been 

beautiful when it was first built in 
the late 1800s, and certain features 
remain, namely a spacious living 
room and a big kitchen. When 
my roommates and I first moved 
in a year ago, I decided I’d take 
advantage of the latter.

Part of this is a matter of personal 

preference. Eating in, on average, 
is less expensive than dining 
out. There’s the added benefit of 
dictating your own serving size and 
adjusting recipes to your own tastes. 
I also just happen to enjoy cooking. 
It’s fun and relaxing for me.

Enter: meatloaf.
I can’t tell you why, but making 

a meatloaf puts a smile on my 
face. There’s an unparalleled 
satisfaction 
that 
comes 

from 
mixing 
together 
eggs, 

breadcrumbs, 
ground 
meat 

(turkey, beef, pork … you name 
it), spices, herbs and sauces. It’s 
ingredient teamwork, and the 
result is hearty, juicy and filling.

Our apartment dynamic is 

also 
meatloaf-esque. 
Matt, 

Casey and I are indiscriminate 
ingredients that come together 
to make something great. The 
likelihood of a nursing student 
from Oakland, Calif., a pre-med 
kinesiology student from Grand 
Rapids, Mich., and a public 
policy student from Los Angeles 
who met during Welcome Week 
their freshman year becoming 
close friends and living together 
is just as crazy as someone, 
eons ago, realizing meat could 
somehow be more delicious in loaf 
form. But it just works.

Meaty 
analogies 
about 

friendship aside (there is more 
to me than a love of meatloaf ), 
cooking 
in 
our 
Kerrytown 

kitchen is important to me 
because it brings us together at 
the end of the day.

Our experiences are vastly 

different. 
Matt 
conducts 

clinicals in the hospital, Casey 
works in a lab on North Campus, 
and when I’m not doing policy 
reading, 
I’m 
writing 
these 

sentimental columns. But the 
few times a week when we are 
able to gather, cook a meal 
together, sit down at our kitchen 
table and talk about anything — 
from classes to politics to funny 
Facebook videos to existential 
crises — those times are among 
my most cherished.

Those are opportunities for 

us to decompress, to bond and to 
grow. The significance of home-
cooked meals in our lives is no 
anomaly. Eating dinner with 
family is associated with better 
dietary patterns, job and work 
productivity and psychological 
well-being.

My 
takeaway? 
Long 
live 

meatloaf.

I found happiness in meatloaf 

Over the past year or so, and 

especially 
recently 
with 
the 

University of Chicago dean of 
students’ letter, trigger warnings 
and safe spaces have become a 
widely debated topic on campuses 
across the country. Like every 
issue these days, it too has become 
politicized 
along 
extremely 

polarized party lines. I’m here to 
argue that truth exists on both 
sides, and in these truths we can 
find a clear justification for trigger 
warnings and safe spaces that are 
so hotly contested.

Social 
conservatives 
argue 

that 
justifications 
for 
trigger 

warnings and safe spaces reflect 
a general coddling of college 
students, while liberals argue 
we should respect the traumatic 
experiences of people in general 
— 
especially 
those 
exhibiting 

symptoms of PTSD or who fall 
into marginalized social groups.

Though I don’t agree that 

college students are being coddled 
with safe spaces and trigger 
warnings, there’s something to 
be said for the argument that 
our generation is more openly 
emotional than generations past. 
Millennials are often described as 
sensitive, empathetic and open to 
change — some argue too much so.

Maybe this is true because of 

what Princeton professor and New 
York Times opinion writer Christy 
Wampole 
calls 
“the 
emotive 

spectacle” in her new book of 
essays, 
“The 
Other 
Serious: 

Essays for the New American 
Generation.” 
Wampole 
writes, 

“There seems to be an emphasis 
on showing people in the process 
of feeling strong emotions.”

Wampole suggests that maybe 

this emphasis “works in lieu of 
audience members experiencing 
real emotions themselves.” I’ll be 
the first person to tell you that 
my generation’s habit of assigning 
emotionally difficult interactions 
to the realms of texting (versus 
speaking face-to-face) has a dulling 
effect on emotions. But I’d like to 
offer a slightly different argument: 
With the media millennials have 
been faced with most of their 
lives — a large portion of which 
is likely to have been emotionally 
focused — it’s likely this generation 
is at least more aware of a wider 
sample of emotional experiences 
across demographic groups than 
generations past.

Wampole mentions, “All of this 

is staged to toy with our mirror 
neurons. 
Somebody 
wants 
to 

use empathy against us.” Here 
Wampole suggests that mass media 
outlets know we’ll feel affected by 
these accounts and images of the 
affected person. They’re using 
people’s emotional experiences 
to draw the consumer in, to get as 
many clicks as possible.

Perhaps 
millennials, 
to 
a 

greater extent than any preceding 
generation, 
have 
been 
made 

the commodities of mass media 
outlets owned by big corporations 
and 
media 
conglomerates. 

But maybe there’s something 
redeemable in this kidnapping of 
our mirror neurons. Maybe the 
influx of emotional images has 
made us, at least in part, more 
empathetic in very real, very 
deep ways that can allow us to 
better understand one another 
across demographic groups.

I say this all only to highlight 

that, yes, our generation is more 
openly or outwardly emotional 
than 
prior 
generations. 
The 

origins of this could be in mass 
media’s 
emotive 
spectacle, 
it 

could be in Facebook or it could 
be a revolt against less emotional 
previous generations that are seen 
as oppressive (of such emotions, 
of 
marginalized 
populations). 

An effect could be that we’re too 
sensitive of each other’s emotions 
at times. But I argue these 
occasions are the exceptions and 
not the rules.

So when it comes to trigger 

warnings, one may ask: What is 
it people are asking to be warned 
about, exactly? What is it people 
are asking to be kept safe from? 
Groups that come to mind, which 
can intersect with one another, 
are 
the 
LGBTQ 
community, 

people of color, Muslims who walk 
to class in the morning only to find 
the words “stop Islam” written 
on the Diag. These are all groups 
that face different but interwoven 
systems of oppression that often 
manifest themselves in distinct 
events that can be traumatic for 
some. To claim trigger warnings 
and safe spaces are unwarranted 
delegitimizes these experiences 
for marginalized groups. To 
borrow from a recent piece 
by 
Daily 
columnist 
Clarissa 

Donnelly-DeRoven, if someone 
says they’re hurt, you don’t get 

to tell them they’re not.

It is also crucial to consider 

who, exactly, is speaking out 
against 
trigger 
warnings 
and 

safe spaces. At the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
2016 
Spring 

Commencement 
ceremony, 

Michael Bloomberg spoke out 
against 
safe 
spaces, 
trigger 

warnings and code words, saying, 
“Microaggressions 
are 
exactly 

that: micro.” It’s worth noting 
that Bloomberg is a white male 
who grew up in a middle-class 
Boston suburb which was more 
than 75 percent white. During 
Bloomberg’s time as mayor of New 
York City, he ran an administration 
that was, according to Federal 
District Judge Shira Scheindlin, 
“deliberately indifferent” toward 
discriminatory 
stop-and-frisk 

policing. Today, Bloomberg is 
worth more than $48 billion. 
I’d say it’s clear that Bloomberg 
is hardly one to talk about how 
universities 
might 
approach 

creating a welcoming and inclusive 
campus for marginalized groups.

Another recent example whom 

I mentioned previously is the 
University of Chicago’s dean of 
students, 
John 
“Jay” 
Ellison. 

Ellison, also a white male, is the 
son of an epidemiologist and 
spent most of his childhood in 
Georgia (and some of it in a small 
community in Minnesota that 
is more than 80 percent white). 
Here he eventually served as 
a police officer for four years 
before finishing his education 
at 
Southeastern 
University, 

which 
the 
Harvard 
Crimson 

describes as a “Bible college in 
rural Florida.” While I’d like 
to avoid stereotyping, Ellison’s 
background makes me doubt the 
validity of his criticisms of safe 
spaces and trigger warnings.

Yes, 
millennials 
are 
too 

sensitive, but we are a generation 
that is considerate of others. 
Because of globalization, we 
are more connected than ever. 
Many of these sensitivities aim 
to respect experiences of our 
friends 
across 
demographic 

groups 
who’ve 
experienced 

hardship 
at 
the 
hands 
of 

systematic oppression built over 
centuries. And that is something 
honorable.

FROM THE VAULT
Why ‘Jack and Jill’ 
will never be a classic

By WILL STEWART

For the Daily

In “From the Vault,” Daily 

Arts takes a new look at old films.

Adam Sandler’s career is 

that of an 8th grade boy who 
gains 
overnight 
popularity 

from a hidden talent — making 
strangely accurate fart noises 
under his armpit during lunch-
time. The entire grade cannot 
get enough of this talent, and 
it never fails to win over the 
laughter and hearts of his class-
mates. But one day, the entire 
grade suddenly realizes how 
immature this gag was all along, 
ending the joke’s reign. The 8th 
grade boy is forced to quit the 
act and resort to sitting alone at 
lunch, just like old times. Adam 
Sandler, unlike the boy, never 
stopped making the same joke.

Sandler’s 
filmography 

includes comedies that domi-
nated the ’90s, like “Billy Madi-
son” and “Happy Gilmore.” 
He proved his capability for 
serious roles in Paul Thomas 
Anderson’s 
“Punch 
Drunk 

Love.” Sadly, audiences would 
never see another Sandler per-
formance as captivating, as the 
actor moved on to a series of 
movies condemned by fans and 
critics alike.

In 2011, Sandler reached a 

new low point as an actor and 
screenwriter with “Jack and 
Jill.” He stars as the two titu-
lar characters, a pair of twins 
engulfed in years of trivial fam-
ily turmoil. Sandler doesn’t shy 
away from unleashing his arse-
nal of poop and offensive Mexi-
can immigrant jokes that would 
make 
even 
Donald 
Trump 

cringe. The film lasts 90 min-
utes and feels as if it were cre-
ated in 30.

At five years old, “Jack and 

Jill” can be evaluated different-
ly. Already lampooned by critics, 
the film might offer more than 
what was initially perceived. 
It is possible that this disaster 
can be such a mess that it man-
ages to pick up a few laughs and 
warm the hearts of its viewers. 
Certainly, the aforementioned 
armpit-farting 8th grader could 
be somewhat laughable; every-
one can appreciate the intricacy 
of a well executed fart joke.

“Jack and Jill,” on paper, 

has the potential to be a cult 
classic. Weak acting, lazy plot-
twists and uninspiring dialogue 
are qualities that define such 
movies, like Tommy Wiseau’s 
catastrophic masterpiece “The 
Room.” To much disappoint-
ment, in “Jack and Jill,” these 
qualities are just brutal. 

Subtlety was never Sandler’s 

forte, and this movie is no 
exception. Every joke feels like 
it is forced down the viewer’s 
esophagus until it aggressively 
hits the stomach, leaving noth-
ing but nausea. A scene in which 
a grandma menacingly stares at 
Jill during a Mexican family’s 
outdoor party — which doesn’t 
shy away from cheap jabs — 
has potential to be so bizarre 
that it’s enjoyable, but even this 
fails. The gags revolve around 
lazy slapstick comedy — in the 
party scene, the elderly woman 
is hit over the head with various 
objects and fed habanero pep-
pers until she is revived.

The choice between sitting 

through “Jack and Jill” and 
ingesting a raw habanero pep-
per is conflicting. The most 
painful quality of the movie is 
Sandler’s performance as Jill. 
Her shrieking voice will haunt 
the viewer for days. It feels 

forced but seamless, contrived 
while effortless. Often, soap 
opera-esque acting can be the 
funniest of all; cringeworthy 
displays of emotion can just 
bleed hilarity. Here, any effort 
just feels pathetic.

If Adam Sandler weren’t such 

a phenomenon, the acting and 
cheap gags would maybe go 
over better. But audiences are 
too familiar with his style that 
it is hard to disassociate the 
actor from the character. The 
world knows Adam Sandler far 
too well for “Jack and Jill” to 
ever feel like an accidental gem, 
a work that is so awful that it’s 
really an artistic feat. It could 
be that the film feels passion-
less. With movies like “The 
Room,” at least every line of dia-
logue and every shot was fueled 
by a deep love for the project. 
It’s impossible to believe that 
Sandler ever thought this work 
was even worthy of his own 
approval.

“Jack and Jill” will never gain 

a cult following; the world will 
never see the day where its mid-
night showings will flood with 
devoted fans quoting Sander’s 
jokes and dressed as Jill. As ter-
rible as it is, laughing at others’ 
pain or failures can be fun, but 
even that is nearly impossible 
with “Jack and Jill.”

FILM REVIEW
‘Equity’ is anti-
feminist & weak

This gender-

reversed “Wolf of 
Wall Street” is just 

as sexist

By SYDNEY COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

“The Wolf of Wall Street” and 

“The Big Short” are giants in 
the realm of films about invest-
ment 
bank-

ing. 
Their 

exclusively 
male 
casts 

are expected, 
with big name 
actors fulfill-
ing 
roles 
of 

power-hungry men infiltrating 
the system and climbing the 
financial ladder. However, as 
the first in this genre to sub-
stitute male protagonists for 
women, ‘Equity” heavily dis-
appoints on its promise of a 
feminist look at the high stakes 
world of investment banking.

“Equity” tells the story of big 

shot investment banker Naomi 
Bishop (Anna Gunn, “Breaking 
Bad”) as she works on a deal 
with a startup to market their 
IPO. Simultaneously, federal 
prosecutor Sam (“Alysia Rein-
er, “Orange is the New Black”) 
works to uncover a thread of 
corruption and insider trading 
centered around Naomi’s boy-
friend Michael (James Purefoy, 
“The Following”). It is a classic 
white-collar crime thriller, but 
one with a female protagonist.

The film is a weak attempt at 

female empowerment. Naomi is 
characterized as the archetyp-
al independent and ambitious 
Manhattan working woman, 
her voice working to break 
the taboo of women speak-
ing openly about money and 
power. A supplementary female 
cast includes Naomi’s VP Erin 

(Samantha 
Megan 
Thomas, 

“Backwards”), 
and 
banking 

corruption investigator Sam, 
both professional women work-
ing in male-dominated fields.

Throughout the film, the 

leads struggle to maintain their 
power, status and reputations 
among other male professionals 
in their field who consistently 
undermine 
and 
undervalue 

them. However, these women 
are wholly one-dimensional. 
Their uncomplicated person-
alities are emphasized through 
acting and dialogue that is flat, 
predictable and cheesy, doing 
nothing to add complexion to 
the characters or the plot and 
becoming essentially unneces-
sary. The result is that these 
elements work to undermine 
what the film is trying to do. 
Instead of portraying realistic 
and strong women, the film 
offers stale and robotic women 
acting in ways expected of the 
independent female Hollywood 
stereotype — that is to say, 
unwaveringly 
power-hungry 

and unabashedly ambitious.

Somehow a film that is sup-

posed to be about women winds 
up being about men, as femi-
nism is shredded even further in 
“Equity.” The two major motifs 
in the film are perception and 
manipulation, with men pre-
sented as malleable objects 
whom the women must mold 
for their own personal gain. 
For example, in regards how 
Erin should interact with IPO 
founder Ed (Samuel Roukin, 
“Salem”), Naomi advises her to 
handle him “very, very gently.” 

Ed is not a free agent in this 
relationship, but clay in Erin’s 
hand; she has the power to 
influence him and his business 
decisions. In this way men are 
both powerless and powerful, 
as their thoughts and actions 
are controlled by women but 
drive the entire plot.

While the female power to 

manipulate men may seem 
feminist at first glance, it is 
actually extremely sexist. In 
“Equity,” the female power lies 
in their perception under the 
male gaze — or in other words, 
their sexuality. For one, Erin 
only influences Ed in tight 
cocktail dresses at sexy, dimly-
lit sushi restaurants. Further, 
Sam 
only 
gets 
information 

out of one of Michael’s insider 
trading buddies through a fla-
grant and uncomfortable scene 
of flirting and sexual baiting. 
Ultimately, the film works to 
reinforce stereotypes of women 
as sexual objects whose only 
power lies in the use of their 
bodies. Interestingly enough, in 
“Equity” this use is conscious-
ly wielded. The women of the 
film understand that their only 
means of power is sex, and they 
wield it strategically and often; 
the film consistently drives the 
message that women can attain 
and maintain power through 
their sexuality, as long as they 
know how to “play the game.” 
This consciousness is perhaps a 
tiny feminist nugget hidden in a 
mountain of objectification.

“Equity,” is not a film about 

women in the word of invest-
ment baking, but instead about 
men who are manipulated by 
women in cunning and sexu-
ally-driven ways. The film is 
glaringly antifeminist and dis-
appointing as a work intended 
to break cinematic tropes of 
the male-dominated banking 
industry. Also, the acting is just 
plain awful. 

Adam Sandler’s 

career is that 
of a farting 8th 

grade boy.

On new LP, Wilco 
still rock-solid vets

By JOEY SCHUMAN

Daily Arts Writer

On “Shrug and Destroy,” the 

ostensible comedown on Wilco’s 
latest release, Shmilco, frontman 
Jeff Tweedy 
repeats 
four 
words 

— 
“Noth-

ing is left, 
rejoice”— 
as the final 
chords ring 
out. 
Four 

words, 
as 

enigmatic as four words can be 
and yet entirely accurate. Wilco 
rests comfortably atop the perch 
of 21st century folk rockers; they 
don’t have much to prove. It’s 
appropriate, then, that Shmil-
co — clocking in at 37 minutes 
long — continues the trend of 
last year’s 34-minute Star Wars 
and is one of their most succinct 
releases to date. Short in length, 
there’s a palpable innocence to 
the album. Instead of walking 
us through emotion, they reflect 
upon it, and there’s something 
peaceful in that.

The opening track, “Normal 

American Kids,” is emblematic 
of this style. The relatively iso-

lated vocals and vulnerable lyri-
cism are fitting, and the combo 
is a nice reminder of the early 
moments of “I Am Trying to 
Break Your Heart” — the mag-
num opus of an opener on their 
magnum opus of an album, 
Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Tweedy’s 
winding voice sounds as genu-
ine now as it did in 2002 along-
side a lone acoustic guitar. He 
goes out on one of his furthest 
extending limbs yet with lines 
like “All of my spirit leaked like 
a cut / I knew what I needed 
would never be enough / I was 
too high to change my bed / 
Always afraid to be a normal 
American kid.” For a band that’s 
been accompanied by seemingly 
every possible instrument, such 
simplicity is both welcome and 
well-executed. In fact, it essen-
tially legitimizes their vul-
nerability. Wilco seems to be 
imperfect by nature and stoner-
ish in character — this winding 
ballad of solitude consequently 
tells more than enough about 
where 
Tweedy’s 
been 
and, 

possibly, informs us about the 
future direction of the band.

This introspectiveness hasn’t 

previously been on such an 
album-wide display. On “If I 

Ever Was a Child” there are 
snippets like, “I’ve never been 
alone / Long enough to know / 
If I ever was a child.” Satisfying-
ly straightforward “Someone to 
Lose” finds Tweedy wishing an 
ex-lover has her heart broken 
again, all the while trying to 
understand his own place in it 
all. “Locator,” “We Aren’t the 
World (Safety Girl)” and “Just 
Say Goodbye,” each of which 
has its own sound founded in 
stripped down instrumentals, 
gracefully close out the album. 
Maybe Tweedy and co. feel con-
tent (or at least comfortable) 
enough with their past work to 
make what most would consid-
er, more or less, a 12-track long 
musical diary, but maybe not. 
He has entwined many of his 
songs with a hint of apathy, so 
while fully absorbing the band’s 
new material is important, over-
ly digging for some type of read 
on their trajectory really might 
just be superfluous. The music is 
only there to feel.

And, at its purest, Shmilco is 

12 tracks of calm sentiment. The 
grandeur from “I’m the Man 
Who Loves You” isn’t there, but 
it’s just the right feel for Wilco 
this time around.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Classical Music Columnist
T

his is a true story.

It was late night in 

June of 1937, and the 

young 
composer 
sat 
alone 

in 
his 
Moscow 
apartment, 

bent over his work. The room 
was 
quiet 
except 
for 
the 

metronomic ticking of the clock 
on the mantle and the furious 
scribbling of the composer’s 
pen. In the opposite corner his 
piano stood untouched — he 
didn’t need it.

Peering at the tiny notes on 

his manuscript through the 
smoky haze around him, the 
composer pushed his round 
spectacles back up the bridge of 
his sweat-covered nose before 
nervously 
lighting 
another 

cigarette, 
his 
thin 
fingers 

fumbling for a moment with 
the lighter. It was probably his 
20th cigarette of the evening — 
he always smoked when he was 
anxious. He jumped at a sudden 
noise outside in the hallway; 
for a while now he has been 
expecting Stalin’s Narodnyu 
Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del 
to pay him a midnight visit.

After a moment, he returned 

to his music. He was writing 
a 
very 
important 
work, 
a 

symphony, perhaps the most 
important work of his life — 
more important probably than 
his previous four symphonies, 
or his opera “Lady Macbeth,” 
and with luck Stalin wouldn’t 
hate this one. If all went well 
this piece would redeem his 
reputation, remove him from 
the blacklist of “formalist” 
composers 
and 
reinvigorate 

his career. If he isn’t caught, 
that is. That’s a very important 
detail. It’s crucial that Stalin 
can’t know that his symphony 
of “rejoicing” is really a work 
of satire and mockery. That 
would be the end of him. They 
had already killed plenty of 
his acquaintances, and the 
composer 
could 
never 
be 

convinced 
that 
Mayakovsky 

had actually shot himself.

The composer didn’t really 

know why he was taking the 
risk of writing a satire. Perhaps 
he simply couldn’t stomach 
the idea of writing a joyful 
work among the horror around 
him. Besides, it’s not as if 
people would really be able to 
understand what he was saying 
— only the clever ones would get 
it, the ones who would notice 
the 
soul-crushing 
sadness 

of the third movement and 
sarcastic bombast of the finale. 
And honestly, most people are 
rather stupid if you think about 
it, so the risk was very low. 

This is what the composer told 
himself. He told himself this 
very often. So he was writing a 
symphony of false rejoicing, for 
better or for worse.

•••
The above is a tableau from 

the life of the Soviet composer 
Dmitri Shostakovich, in which 
he composes one of the most 
enduringly popular symphonies 
of the 20th-century, his fifth. 
Additionally, 
it’s 
almost 

certainly a lie — or, if not quite 
that, it’s hyperbolic in the 
extreme.

But it is a very compelling 

lie. A very large and influential 
part of me wants to buy into 
the above image, wants to 
see Shostakovich as a quiet 
dissident, as a frightened artist 
silently struggling against the 
brutal Soviet machine — and 
that’s not only because I wrote 
it. The words are mine, but 
the story is the same one I’ve 
always heard in classical music 
circles. It has been part of my 
perception of the composer for 
as long as I can remember.

And I’m certainly not alone; 

if you opened a Shostakovich 
program note or asked any 
random classical musician or 
regular American concertgoer 
about the subject, you almost 
surely will receive the same 
description you just read, i.e. 
that 
Shostakovich 
subtlety 

slipped little anti-Sovietisms 
into his music and quietly 
fought against Stalin’s tyranny 
through his art.

But the story’s prevalence 

doesn’t make it any more true. 
This particular version of the 
composer came almost entirely 
from one source, inculcated 
by 
a 
1979 
book 
called 

“Testimony,” 
by 
Solomon 

Volkov. The book claims to be 
the memoirs of Shostakovich, 
merely arranged and edited 
by Volkov — however, there’s 
a litany of reasons to doubt 
its authenticity (which I won’t 
bother going into here), and 
its veracity has been a point 
of heated scholarly debate for 
the better part of 30 years. I’m 
sure you have already deduced 
which side of the argument I 
fall on, but for the time being 
I ask you to forget about that. 
Right now, I’m not really 
concerned with whether or not 
the image is a lie. Right now, 
what I care about is whether it 
really matters that it’s a lie.

Before you roll your eyes, 

dismiss me as just another 
relativist and abandon the rest 

of this article, let me clear up 
a few things. I realize that I’m 
starting to sound dangerously 
similar to that one student in 
your mind-numbingly tedious 
freshman English class (“You 
can’t really say that, because 
everything is relative”), so let 
me quickly allay some fears. Of 
course objective truth matters. 
Shostakovich 
either 
worked 

anti-Soviet messages into his 
music or he didn’t — that’s not 
going away, and musicologists 
certainly 
shouldn’t 
drop 

the subject. But at the same 
time, we’re talking about the 
ever-elusive 
(capital-A) 
Art, 

where human perception is a 
necessary conduit for meaning. 
So as frustrating as it is to 
hear, in such a nebulous and 
perception-oriented 
realm 

as this, everything really is 
relative. That’s not going away 
either.

As it pertains to Shostakov-

ich, this question of truth is a 
very interesting one. He’s unde-
niably one of the most popular 
composers of the 20th-century, 
and I personally think that 
this has a great deal to do with 
the image you read above. 
Shostakovich-as-dissident 
is 

a very emotionally satisfy-
ing identity, particularly in 
the United States, where the 
residual ethos of the Cold War 
linger still: The idea of the-
artist-as-hero is a striking one 
— powerful in the Romantic 
sense — which easily fuses 
with the American passion 
for individualism, all of which 
I think enhances Shostakov-
ich’s fame in the United States. 
This version of Shostakovich 
has seeped into everything. 
For example, just this year the 
Grammy for Best Orchestral 
Performance went to Andris 
Nelsons and the Boston Sym-
phony 
for 
“Under 
Stalin’s 

Shadow,” a recording of Shosta-
kovich’s Symphony No. 10.

None of which is to say 

that I think Shostakovich’s 
popularity is unwarranted — 
he was my favorite composer 
for a time, before I decided 
that having explicit favorites 
was sort of impossible/limiting 
— or that “Under Stalin’s 
Shadow” doesn’t deserve a 
Grammy (I heard the Boston 
Symphony Orchestra perform 
it last summer, and it certainly 
does), but simply that his fame 
is augmented by his story, 
however fictitious. So much of 
his notability is constructed on 
a falsehood. And yet, I would 
postulate that in this context, 
the idea of Shostakovich-as-
dissident is not necessarily 
false, even if it’s a lie.

Without getting into too 

much technical detail, there 
is a concept in philosophical/
literary theory called verisi-
militude, or the idea that one 
thing can be less false than 
another, perhaps even if the 
first is a lie and the second the 
objective “truth,” in the sense 
that the second only expresses 
what something is, while the 
first expresses what something 
means.

As Tim O’Brien succinctly 

notes in his excellent Vietnam 
War novel “The Things They 
Carried,” “A thing may happen 
and be a total lie; another thing 
may not happen and be truer 
than the truth.” So perhaps 
that’s what all the Shostakovich 
stories are — truer than truth 
because of what they mean to 
the audience. Ultimately, you 
just have to listen and decide 
for yourself.

Shostakovich, Stalin, 

Terror & Truth

M.I.A. takes ‘AIM’ 
and misses the mark

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

Unabashed activism is impor-

tant. Important, and danger-
ous. The more radicalized we 
become, the 
less we allow 
our 
posi-

tions to be 
challenged 
and 
our 

understand-
ings 
to 
be 

broadened. 
It’s easy to 
scream talk-
ing points over confrontation — 
nuance is hard. AIM, the fifth 
and supposed final album from 
the Sri Lankan refugee artist 
M.I.A, would have benefited 
from some confrontation and 
nuance.

The 
production, 
handled 

by Diplo, is “bigger” here than 
on nearly any of her previous 
works — though not necessar-
ily better. Right from the start 
a pounding bass is placed at the 
foreground. “Borders” pulses 
with the familiarity of any num-
ber of Electric Daisy Carnival 
headliners: swirling synths, the 
pause of the production on a 
high pitched hook and the quick 
return, accompanied either by 
the sound of a car zooming or, 
maybe, a refrigerator powering 
up.

Much 
here 
resembles 
an 

echo, and not always in the most 
pleasant or successful way. The 
beats can echo into redundancy. 
M.I.A.’s delivery echoes her pre-
vious work, often incorporating 
and rehashing lyrics and refer-
ences from her own discogra-
phy. And the album itself echoes 
what once was, distant from the 
greatness of earlier albums like 
Kala and Arular.

AIM does have its moments, 

though. “Go Off” is exciting and 
catchy enough to feel in your 
bones, and manages to make 
some of the subtle, yet biting 
critiques of Western society that 
she’s done so well in the past: 
“At least you tell your children I 
came from London.” The bragga-
docious “A.M.P.” recalls some of 
her more successful tracks, like 
“Bamboo Banga” and “Boyz.” 
But it’s the final — and best — 
track, “Platforms,” which offers 
us the most powerful reminder 
of that burning yellow roman 
candle we once knew, with con-
templative, cryptic lyrics and 
a confident flow that demands 
attentiveness. That it took 16 
tracks to reach this level of suc-
cess, though, is telling.

What’s certain is that there 

is nothing here even remotely 
comparable to her ceiling-shat-
tering single “Paper Planes” or 
the unforgettable “Bad Girls.”

The rest of the album, frankly, 

is almost entirely forgettable. 
This is especially frustrating 

given the reputation that she’s 
built as a kind of global ambas-
sador in recent years. Where she 
once stitched sounds and ideas 
from Bollywood films and pre-
teen Australian rap groups, she’s 
now rapping about Proactiv 
over commercialized beats and 
shouting out R. Kelly. It’s almost 
baffling the lack of actual sub-
stance included on this album, 
given the ongoing migrant cri-
sis, increasing global xenopho-
bia and the increasing growing 
disdain shown to refugees today. 
These are all issues M.I.A. has 
been a fierce critic of before. 
Why she isn’t making an equally 
fierce album in response is any-
one’s guess.

When she does makes state-

ments here, they come across as 
confusingly boring and underde-
veloped, like she’s listing talking 
points, not arguing for them. She 
opens the album with a series of 
questions: “Borders / What’s up 
with that? / Politics / What’s up 
with that? / Police shots / What’s 
up with that?” The ideas here 
have potential, which makes it 
all the more frustrating that she 
only brushes them with vague 
and lazy hands — there’s so 
much that she could have done, 
and has done before, that she 
hardly even attempts on AIM.

Perhaps M.I.A. fans would be 

better off simply omitting this 
final album. There’s too much to 
praise, to admire, before this.

‘Our Little Sister’ is 
sluggish & minimal

By JOE WAGNER

Daily Arts Writer

“Our Little Sister,” direc-

tor Hirokazu Koreeda’s most 
recent film, 
based 
on 

the popular 
manga series 
“Umima-
chi 
Diary,” 

which liter-
ally 
trans-

lates 
to 

“Seaside 
Town Diary,” is a modern tale of 
divorce. It endeavors to address 
the slew of consequences relat-
ed to divorce and moreover, and 
perhaps unfortunately, to life in 
general.

Three sisters, Sachi Kouda 

(Haruka Ayase, “Ichi”), Yoshi-
no Kouda (Masami Nagasawa, 
“From Up on Poppy Hill”), 
Chika Kouda (Kaho, “A Gentle 
Breeze in Village”) live togeth-
er in the house in Kamakura 
that they were raised in until 
their parents divorced, and 
their mother then abandoned 
them while the eldest was still 
in high school. After not talk-
ing to their father for 15 years, 
the three sisters attend their 
father’s funeral, where they 
meet their younger half-sister 
Suzu Asano (“Suzu Hirose, 
“Chihayafuru Part I”). The 
eldest sister offers to have Suzu 

come back and live with them 
at their home in Kamakura. As 
far as plot goes, this is about the 
extent of the movie. What fol-
lows is the dealings of the four 
sisters living under the same 
roof.

Each of the three blood-relat-

ed sisters clearly represents a 
certain type of person. Sachi, 
the eldest, is serious, work-ori-
ented and struggles with love. 
Ironically, she has an affair 
with a married man — the same 
action that destroyed her fam-
ily. Yoshino is constantly falling 
for different men and cares lit-
tle about her job. Chika is in cer-
tain ways the most immature, a 
bit ditsy, but overall, seems to 
be the happiest and maintains 
a healthy relationship with her 
boyfriend. Yoshino and Chika 
call Sachi “Sis” in a way that 
is reminiscent of how a more 
typical family might address 
their mother as “Mom.” When 
Suzu comes to their home, she 
helps to put all of their lives in 
perspective. Suzu is happy, or 
at least relatively so, even after 
her father has passed, constant-
ly cheerful while simultane-
ously acting quite mature for 
her age. As a result, these char-
acters feel flat and their actions 
are predictable. 

The sisters learn from each 

other and attempt to find pas-
sion in each of their lives. With 

the death of their father and 
the terminal diagnosis of a 
close family friend who runs 
a diner, their lives are put into 
perspective. The sisters learn to 
value their sisterhood, and try 
to reconcile relationships with 
their mother. They grow to 
understand that relationships, 
particularly familial ones, are 
give and take, that they are two 
sided. These same deaths teach 
them beauty and its value. The 
most memorable line from the 
film is when Suzu recalls sit-
ting next to her dying father 
in the hospital and he remarks 
about how he is happy that, 
even while dying, he is still able 
to appreciate beauty. But the 
plot simply isn’t strong enough 
to warrant the exploration of 
these large themes.

While “Our Little Sister” 

examines so many beautiful 
and touching themes, the nar-
rative is so minimal it is diffi-
cult to maintain interest in this 
rather sluggishly paced film. 
The soft focus compositions of 
the Japanese countryside seem 
like paintings, lending a fantas-
tical aura to “Our Little Sister.” 
These shots are true highlights 
throughout the film. The movie 
feels like a fable. But every 
good fable has not only strong 
themes, but a strong narrative 
through which those themes 
can be explored.

What Michigan and Colorado lack in years of memories on the 
football field, they make up for in drama. The two met for one of 
the wildest finishes in college football history when the Buffaloes 
stunned Michigan on a last-second Hail Mary in 1994. This time 
around, Colorado has struggled as a program but appears to be 
on the upswing. We’ll see how far they’ve come on Saturday.

Michigan wraps up non-league 
schedule at home vs. Colorado

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

And now, a test.
The No. 4 Michigan football 

team (2-0) steamrolled its first 
two 
opponents 

by a combined 
107 
points. 
It 

left 
no 
doubt 

in 
Michigan 

Stadium 
either 

time as to which 
was the better 
team.

Saturday, the 

Wolverines host 
a Colorado team 
that 
has 
also 

clobbered its first 
two 
opponents. 

The 
Buffaloes’ 

combined 
margin 
of 
victory 

through two games is 86, and 
they have yet to allow more than a 
touchdown in a single game.

While those numbers are against 

inferior 
competition, 
Colorado 

(2-0) should be the toughest 
challenge Michigan has faced thus 
far. Whereas Central Florida did its 
damage on the ground against the 
Wolverines, secondary coach Mike 
Zordich is bracing for the Buffaloes 
to attack through the air.

“This’ll definitely be more of a 

challenge than the first two games,” 
he said Wednesday. “No disrespect, 
but it is what it is. They’re better 
receivers, and the quarterback is 
a much better quarterback. He’s a 
guy that actually has time to throw, 
and he’s got three or four good guys 
to throw to.”

Five-foot-eleven 
receiver 

Shay Fields is Colorado’s leading 
receiver so far, hauling in five 
catches for 157 yards, but the group 
is deep. Devin Ross has caught the 
most passes, 11, for 124 yards and 
a pair of scores, and junior Bryce 
Bobo is off to a strong start as well.

Michigan has given up a total 

of 207 passing yards through two 
games, and Colorado seems poised 
to match that total — at least — if it 
has its way.

The Wolverines will likely still 

be playing without all-American 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis, leaving 
senior 
cornerback 
Channing 

Stribling and fifth-year senior 
Jeremy Clark to hold Colorado 

in check. They have performed 
admirably so far, but after Stribling 
and senior safety Delano Hill each 
returned an interception for a 
touchdown against Hawaii, the 
Knights didn’t really attack the 
Wolverines through the air.

Colorado 
quarterback 
Sefo 

Liufau 
presents 
a 
legitimate 

threat to that end, averaging 10.4 
yards per attempt this season. 
Complementing that are his 6.0 
yards per carry, which makes 
Liufau the type of threat Michigan 
was vulnerable to last week — 
the Wolverines allowed UCF to 
repeatedly break contain and rack 
up 275 rushing yards.

On the flip side, Michigan’s rush 

attack managed just 119 yards. That 
gave the Wolverines plenty to focus 
on in their week.

“I’m very excited as a coach, that 

you can win a game 51-14 and then 
you still have things to go in and 
coach and feel like you can improve 
your play on,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said Monday. “There’s 
probably no better feeling as a coach 
than to start the week that way. And 
it makes me very optimistic that 
there’s ways that we can improve, 
there’s things that we can fix.”

Against the Buffaloes, Michigan 

will once again rely on its stout 
defensive line to lead the way. Fifth-
year senior defensive tackle Ryan 
Glasgow is off to another strong 
start in the middle, and freshman 
defensive end Rashan Gary made 
his first major mark with a sack 
last week. Add in fifth-year senior 
defensive end Chris Wormley 
and 
redshirt 
junior 
defensive 

tackle Maurice Hurst, and the 
Wolverines’ line should remain 
sturdy despite being banged up.

On the other side of the ball, 

the Wolverines boast one of the 
nation’s top scoring offenses to 
go against a Colorado defense 
that hasn’t seen anything close to 
Michigan’s talent.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback 

Wilton Speight has tossed seven 
touchdowns to date, and with fifth-
year senior receivers Amara Darboh 
and Jehu Chesson to go with senior 
tight end Jake Butt, Michigan’s 
offensive weapons seem capable of 
overwhelming Colorado.

And that’s the crux of Saturday’s 

game. Colorado should be the best 
opponent the Wolverines have 
faced, and not by a small margin. 
But against Michigan’s talent, 
even a close game would count as 
something of an upset.

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Michigan Stadium is usually silent.
It is silent through the offseason. 

It is silent at night. It is silent today.

And then there are the rare 

moments of silence when the largest 
building in football is packed with a 
crowd of 100,000-plus people who 
don’t make a sound. For some, that 
silence can drown out any of the 
roars from past memories — John 
Wangler to Anthony Carter in 1979, 
Desmond Howard’s Heisman pose 
in 1991, the first night game against 
Notre Dame in 2011.

That 
hush 
descended 
upon 

Michigan Stadium on Sept. 24, 1994, 
when Colorado quarterback Kordell 
Stewart launched a 64-yard Hail 
Mary to Michael Westbrook, who 
jumped and caught it in the end 
zone to cap a remarkable comeback 
and stun the Wolverines. The play 
became known as the “Miracle at 
Michigan,” etched in the minds of 
both fan bases forever.

Colorado returns to Michigan 

Stadium this weekend for just the 
second time since that game and the 
first time since 1997. To some, the 
Buffaloes’ first trip is but a memory. 
To others, it’s not even that.

Just 23 players on Michigan’s 

current roster were born before the 
“Miracle at Michigan” in 1994. But 
the former players, coaches, staff and 
reporters in attendance will never 
forget it.

***

‘The world changed’

The battle between No. 4 Michigan 

and No. 7 Colorado was one of the 
biggest matchups in the country that 
week. The Wolverines were coming 
off a 26-24 victory at Notre Dame 
two weeks earlier, in which Remy 
Hamilton kicked a game-winning field 
goal to improve Michigan to 2-0. The 
Buffaloes, meanwhile, had trounced 
then-No. 10 Wisconsin, 55-17, the 
previous Saturday.

Both rosters featured loads of 

future NFL talent. Todd Collins 
quarterbacked the Wolverines, who 
also boasted a defense led by Steve 
Morrison, Ty Law, Jarrett Irons and 
Chuck Winters. Running backs Tyrone 
Wheatley and Tshimanga Biakabutuka 
and wide receiver Amani Toomer went 
on to have long pro careers. Colorado 
may have had even more offensive 
firepower, with Kordell Stewart under 
center, Michael Westbrook and Rae 
Carruth at wide receiver and Heisman 
Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam at 
running back.

Jon Falk, equipment manager, 

1974-2013: “Everybody knew that 
it was going to be a tough game. We 
practiced hard. The focus was really 
good for the whole week. All the 
players were psyched, and we went 
out there. And it was a tough week 
of practice, and it really was geared 
to win that daggone game. And to 
be honest with you, they had some 
better players than we did. They 
were pretty daggone good that year.”

The Buffaloes struck first, driving 63 

yards in 11 plays for a Salaam touchdown 
in the opening quarter. After a Michigan 
field goal, they scored again in the 
second on a 27-yard pass from Stewart 
to 
Westbrook 
before 
Biakabutuka 

answered with a four-yard run that 
trimmed the deficit to 14-9. Just before 
halftime, Colorado lined up for its first of 
two Hail Mary tries.

Chuck Winters, free safety, 

1992-1996: “The same exact play 
that happened at the end of the 
game, but the difference was that we 
weren’t on the field right before — 
like a two-minute drill — so we were 
fresh. … All the receivers never made 
it down the field, and I ended up 
getting the interception going into 
halftime. We walked into halftime 
feeling good.”

Michigan came out with new intensity 

in the second half, running its streak 
of unanswered points to 23 in the third 
quarter. Wheatley gave the Wolverines 
the lead, and Hamilton added to it 
with another field goal. Collins threw 
a 65-yard bomb to Amani Toomer to 
make it 26-14 — though, importantly, 
Michigan missed its second two-point 
conversion of the game.

Still, that lead stood with three 

minutes to go in the game. Colorado 
drew within 26-21 on a one-yard run 
by Salaam with 2:16 left, and the 
Wolverines couldn’t run out the clock 
on the ensuing possession. Colorado 
took over on its own 15-yard line with 
15 seconds to go, and a 21-yard pass 
from Stewart to Westbrook put the 
Buffaloes in position for the Hail Mary 
try with six ticks left.

Steve 
Morrison, 
linebacker, 

1990-1994: “The thing I remember 
is just the seconds weren’t flying off 
the clock. They got more plays than 
we thought you’d normally get. … It 
wasn’t like anybody was celebrating 
early. But we were certainly focused, 
and we went back on the field and the 
world changed.”

The two teams called their final 

plays of the game: “Rocket” for 
Colorado, “30 Victory” for Michigan, 
the “30” signifying a three-man 
front with two defensive ends and 
one tackle. With just six seconds left, 
many fans had left the stadium, and on 
the field, the Wolverines knew a huge 

victory was within their grasp.

Morrison: “We certainly weren’t 

thinking we were going to give up 
a whatever-yard touchdown pass 
there. I think we were just concerned 
about finishing the game and doing it 
the right way. There wasn’t anything 
in retrospect, looking back, that I 
saw, you know, ‘That’s a problem’ or 
‘We got cocky’ or anything.”

Thomas 
Guynes, 
offensive 

lineman, 1992-1996: “It’s a little bit 
easier for me to expect the worst, 
but you’re hoping for the best. 
That’s where my head was at — not 
so much that my guys couldn’t do 
it or anything like that, or there 
was any doubt. But just the way the 
momentum shifts were going back 
and forth, I don’t know, it was weird. 
It just kind of felt like there might be 
some shenanigans in the works.”

***

The miracle

Colorado lined up with Westbrook, 

Anderson and Carruth all split wide 
to the left of Stewart, who was under 
center. Salaam was in the backfield, 
with a fourth wideout to the right.

Keith 
Jackson, 
play-by-play 

commentator, on the broadcast: 
“One more, with six seconds.”

Bob Griese, color commentator, 

on the broadcast: “I think he just 
went over and said, ‘Just throw it up.’ ”

Just Michigan’s three linemen were 

even visible in the TV shot, the rest of 
the defenders back deep to guard the 
pass.

Stewart 
took 
the 
snap, 
and 

immediately Colorado double-teamed 
each of Michigan’s defensive linemen: 
right tackle and guard against left end, 

center and left guard against defensive 
tackle, left tackle and running back 
against right end. The pocket formed 
around Stewart as all four receivers 
sprinted toward the end zone.

Jarrett 
Irons, 
linebacker, 

1992-1996: “My job was to jam the 
inside receiver and then kind of just 
fall back in case someone catches 
something underneath. So I jam my 
guy and obviously get him out of his 
route, and I was kind of falling back.”

Winters: “We only rushed three, 

but we felt like if we rushed three, we 
would have more guys in coverage, 
which would allow us to get more 
jams. Now a different philosophy is, 
you can rush four and then put more 
pressure on the quarterback and 
don’t allow him time.”

Stewart dropped back as far as his 

own 26. He moved 
forward, 
then 

backward to elude 
the right end, then 
forward again to 
gather momentum. 
An 
instant 
after 

the last second ran 
off the clock, he let 
the ball go with his 
front foot at the 
27-yard line.

Falk: “We were 

within his grasp two or three times, 
and then all of a sudden, he had 
enough room to launch it like a shot. 
The ball was up in the air, and we’re 
all standing there, looking at the 
ball.”

Guynes: “The offensive line, we 

were on the south side of the sideline. 
So our bench, before you got to the 
cutoff on the sideline, was right there, 
and that pass was thrown into the 
south end zone. So I was pretty much 

right there. I just don’t recall seeing it 
live. I feel like I was sitting on the bench 
and just waiting to hear, ‘Interception, 
ball batted down, incomplete pass,’ 
whatever. I’ll just go grab my helmet 
and let’s get out of here.”

Morrison: “I was kind of hovering 

there, and the rocket ball went up in 
the air. I remember glancing over my 
shoulder and tracking the ball with 
my eyes and at the same time trying 
to run towards it. When I got there 
(Westbrook) was probably one or two 
or three yards deep in the end zone. 
I don’t remember, but I was probably 
around the 10-yard line, five-yard 
line. I wasn’t that far. I saw it go in 
his hands. I had a really good view of 
it, actually.”

As the ball started to fall, Westbrook, 

Robinson and Carruth had all gathered 

around the five-yard 
line just outside the 
left 
hash 
mark. 

Michigan had five 
players in coverage 
— Winters and Law 
among them — with 
Morrison 
among 

three 
stragglers 

behind them.

Falk: 
“To 
be 

honest with you, 
I thought it was 

going to fall at the 15- or 20-yard line. 
I looked up and I said, ‘There’s no way 
it’s gonna make it into the end zone.’ 
But all of a sudden, it was just like the 
wind (lifted) the ball up, and that ball 
was headed down, and all of a sudden 
it just lofted back up in the air.”

With Colorado’s three receivers in 

position, Robinson, Carruth, Law and 
Winters all jumped for the ball at the 
same time around the two-yard line. 
The ball bounced off their bodies and

WESTBROOK 
FOR 
A 

TOUCHDOWN! 
INCREDIBLE!”

Westbrook, 

in the following 
Monday’s 
edition 
of 
the 

Daily: 
“I 
have 

never 
had 
a 

feeling like this 
in my life. It was 
tipped. There was 
nobody else around. It was just me 
and the football. All I had to do was 
catch it.”

Gary Moeller, Michigan head 

coach 1990-1994: “I can’t believe 
this one. That’s about what was going 
through my mind. I can’t believe this.”

Stewart: “I saw the ball go up 

in the air, and I saw this big ol’ arm 
come out of nowhere, and it was 
Michael. … I’m like, ‘This dude went 
up to get this!’ And before you know 
it, I looked to the sideline, everybody 
was running on the field. I saw Rae 
Carruth jumping in the air, and 
James Kidd. I was like, ‘Oh my God! 
We caught that!’”

Winters: “I just figured, ‘OK, I’m 

gonna take the closest guy to me, 
and he’s not catching the ball.’ So as 
I jumped up to swat the ball down, I 
can kind of see at the time someone 
coming from my right. I didn’t know 
who it was at the time, but you watch 
him and you see his side. I’m trying 
to knock the ball down and Ty was 
trying to intercept the ball, and we 
just collided shoulder pads. From 

my vision and what I always recall, 
it appeared that the ball hit right 
between our shoulder pads. We 
bumped shoulder pads, and the ball 
hit directly on our shoulder pads 
and bounced up in the air, and Mike 
Westbrook dove and caught it in the 
end zone.”

Stewart: “This is exactly how 

we draw it up. 
Literally. 
Some 

people say that. 
No, I mean, that’s 
exactly how you 
draw it up. One 
hundred percent.”

Falk: 
“For 

Kordell 
Stewart 

to throw that as 
high and as long 
as he did, you 
gotta 
give 
the 

man credit. It was a heck of a throw. 
I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a guy 
throw a 70-yard pass like that. It 
was 70 yards in the air.”

Irons: “I don’t think we could 

have defended it any better, or them 
doing anything out of the ordinary. 
We practiced that play — it just was 
a fluke play, and it happened. We had 
the right defense that we wanted, and 
we executed what we were supposed 
to do. I just think he made a hell of 
a play.”

Morrison: “I was a coach for a long 

time. We always looked for a better 
way to build the mouse trap. We let 
guys behind us. You just can’t do that. 
We let a guy with a cannon of an arm 
throw a ball that still, to this day, 
I’ve not seen a more beautiful ball. I 
haven’t. It was pretty spectacular.”

Guynes: “I was probably just sitting 

there hoping to get out of here with a 
‘W.’ I don’t recall seeing it live. What I 
do recall is when it happened and I saw 
the ball in the air coming down, I was 
waiting for somebody to throw off the 
reaction. I’m hearing this roar coming 

from the Colorado sideline, and I stood 
up, and I’m like, ‘Man, they caught the 
ball.’ That’s when everything kind of 
kicked in. I stood there for a minute, 
in disbelief and shock like everybody 
else, and I just kind of sat back down 
like, ‘This just happened. These guys 
came into Michigan Stadium and stole 
one from us.’ ”

Doug 
Kanter, 
Daily 

photographer: 
“I 
remember 

everyone was just following the ball, 
and it was going toward the end zone, 
and I was just shooting, shooting, 
shooting. Photographers have this 
thing that if you saw it, then you 
missed it. I actually was shooting 
when the ball was coming down, but 
afterwards, a couple seconds later, 
I looked up and I still didn’t know 
whether he had caught it or not or 
who had caught it.”

Several reporters had already begun 

to come down from the press box to the 
concourse through the seats.

Michael Rosenberg, then Daily 

reporter, now at Sports Illustrated: 
“If you go at the wrong time, it’s a 
nightmare, right? Well, I was at the 
wrong time, because it was the end 
of the game, but there was nobody 
moving. It was a wide-open aisle.”

Rachel Bachman, then Daily 

reporter, now at the Wall Street 
Journal: “I remember walking down 
a stadium aisle from the press box, 
thinking about how I would write 
the Michigan victory. I was about 
30 rows from the field when Stewart 
launched his pass. When it became 
clear that Westbrook caught it, the 
stadium just froze.”

Falk: “I can’t overemphasize how 

disheartening it was.”

***

‘You just felt numb’

The Michigan players on the field 

stood still in shock or remained on the 
ground. Morrison put his hands on his 
head. Other players such as Law and 
free safety Stephen L. King fled the end 
zone as the Buffaloes stormed from their 
sideline to where Westbrook had landed.

Guynes: “I remember just sitting 

on the bench, because I didn’t want 
to have to run through the Colorado 
side, and they’re going nuts over 
there. … I’m taking it all in, and I’m 
not taking it all in. I’m experiencing 
it, so to speak, but it’s just not really 
registering either. … It’s like you know 
you’re there, but you’re not cognizant 
of where you’re at, so to speak.”

Morrison: “It’s disbelief, it’s shock, 

it’s all those things rolled into one. 
You can’t believe it. That’s exactly 
how I felt, and probably to this day 
still feel. You’re stunned by it.”

Winters: “I immediately knew 

that he had caught the ball, and then 
just by the reaction of the crowd. 
I immediately put my head on the 
ground. I was in awe.”

Irons: “I was on the field for a 

little bit — I was in shock, obviously 
— but I got into the locker room, and 
it was a very somber locker room. We 
all were in shock. It was horrible.”

Falk: “We were like, ‘What just 

happened here?’ And the next thing 
you know, the whole Colorado team 
came running across that field just 
running and screaming at us and 
really putting it in our face to be very 
honest with you. I 
was shocked at that 
— of course, we 
were all in shock. 
We just couldn’t 
believe 
what 

happened. We had 
them.”

Bruce 
Madej, 

Michigan 
sports 

information 
director, 
1982-

2010: 
“I 
remember 
(equipment 

manager) Bob Bland smacking the 
desk area, and me just putting my 
hand on my head, putting it down on 
the desk area. It just was one of those 
things that you can’t believe.”

Winters: “Ed Davis and Amani 

Toomer came over and kind of picked 
me up, like, ‘Hey, man, let’s get off the 
field.’ But you could see them running 
around excited, and some of their fans 
excited, and you could just hear our 
fans, they kind of gasped. Almost a 
sigh of disdain, just ‘Wow, this really 
just occurred.’ It was just quiet.”

Bachman: 
“Today 
fans 
react 

immediately: 
People 
watch 
the 

replay, curse, file out of the stadium. 
In 30 seconds, memes are up on 
social media and people at home are 
flipping channels. That day, people 
just stood there. There was no replay 
board. No one had smartphones. 
People just stared in shock. It seemed 
like even the scoreboard operator 
took minutes to put the final points 
on the board. It probably wasn’t that 

long, but the entire sequence felt 
surreal and slow.”

Jackson on the broadcast: “There 

is no time remaining. There are no 
flags on the field. Only despair for the 
maize and blue, joy and exultation for 
the Buffaloes of Colorado.”

Rosenberg: “It was not like any 

other game I’ve ever been to, except 
perhaps the Michigan State game 
last season. Just the idea that people 
were there and nobody was moving, 
and the stadium was just a traffic 
jam, especially back then, just people 
trying to get out at the time.”

Jackson on the broadcast: “It’ll 

be hard, hard, hard to find a play 
that will be remembered more than 
this one in the 1994 college football 
season. … All those who were 
involved will never forget it, either 
for the joy of it or for the pain of it.”

Slowly, the Wolverines made their 

way to the locker room as Stewart and 
the rest of the Buffaloes raced to the 
end zone to celebrate.

Madej: “All of a sudden, the 

sounds of the excitement of the 
locker room are not there. All you 
hear are helmets being thrown into 
the bin. A couple things get tossed on 
the floor. Disappointment. Disgust.”

Falk: “It was dead quiet. Nobody 

said a word. (Moeller) walked in, 
and he didn’t say anything, and he 
just looked around and said, ‘Let’s 
get the next one. Let’s start over 

again 
tomorrow.’ 

Because that’s all 
you could say. It’s 
just a real numbing 
loss. … Everybody 
got dressed and got 
out of that locker 
room about as fast 
as I’ve ever seen 
everybody out of 
the locker room.”

Moeller: 

“(There’s) 
one 
thing 
you 
don’t 

want to do, and that’s start finger-
pointing this guy, that guy. It’s just, 
‘Hey, gentlemen, this is a tough 
football team. This is a tough football 
game, and it played like that. And 
you’ve always got to be ready for all 
conditions in any game.’ ”

Winters: “Our defensive backs 

coach, Billy Harris, came in and it 
was kind of quiet. Everybody was 
kind of sitting there on their stool 
at the locker, and I can recall him 
kicking in the door and just going off. 
Cursing, blaming people for the loss, 
‘It’s your fault! You lost this game!’ 
That kind of approach for the players, 
and he went down the line. He was 
going down the line from each player, 
and then eventually Lloyd told him, 
you know, ‘Go into the coaches’ 
locker room.’ ”

(Asked what Harris said, Winters 

replied, “I don’t think you can put that 
in the paper.”)

Irons: “He was going off. He kept 

saying, ‘30 Victory,’ asking everybody

one. That’s about 
what was going 

through my mind.”

it’s shock, it’s

where they were and why did this 
happen. He was livid. It was a bad 
locker room.”

Later, Falk went to the visiting 

coaches’ locker room to see Colorado 
coach Bill McCartney, who was an 
assistant at Michigan before he took 
the Colorado job.

Falk: “I went in to see him after the 

game. Of course, Bill McCartney is a 
really religious guy. Very religious. 
And I walked into the coaches’ locker 
room after the game, and I said, ‘Well 
Bill, congratulations, but that was a 
really tough loss 
for us.’ And Bill 
looked at me and he 
says, ‘Well Jon, you 
know, the Lord was 
with us today.’ And 
I looked back at 
him and said, ‘The 
Lord was with you 
today? 
Bill, 
that 

was nothing but a 
long pass.’ That’s just the way it went 
right there.”

Morrison: “My wife now, my 

girlfriend at the time, as a lot of 
people tend to do, they leave games 
early. She had no idea that we lost 
the game. I saw her back at the 
apartment, I came right home, and 
I think I got a ‘Congratulations.’ 
She obviously didn’t know what 
happened in the game.”

***

‘It’s a lifetime thing’

After one of the wildest finishes in 

college football history, the Wolverines 
still had eight more regular-season 
games to play. They fell to No. 7 in the 
poll, behind the fifth-ranked Buffaloes. 
They still had a chance for a Big Ten 
championship, but moving on from 
the devastating loss proved to be an 
arduous task.

Morrison: “I don’t know if we 

did, I’ll be honest. You go back and 
you say, we played this Notre Dame 
team and we beat them in the last 
second, and probably riding as high 
as a team could have at the time. 
We’re moving up in the ranks, we’re 
going to play this team that in our 
minds, we had them beat. But that 
only goes so far. Obviously you gotta 
finish the job.”

Moeller, 
in 
the 
following 

Tuesday’s edition of the Daily: 
“You never get over it. You’re not 
supposed to. It’s a lifetime thing.”

Falk: 
“That 
was 
such 
a 

disheartening game that it just took 
an awful lot out of our football team 
for the rest of the year.”

Moeller: “Everything in sports 

doesn’t come out your way, and 
sometimes you’ve got to live with the 
tough ones, and not let it conflict with 
your growing in the next month or 
the next two years or whatever. You 
gotta continue to grow and continue 

to want to do well.”

Without the Hail Mary, Michigan 

would have finished with its first 3-0 
non-conference record since 1986, 
preparing to take the next step beyond 
a Big Ten championship.

Rosenberg: 
“So 
that 
Hail 

Mary changed the story from a 
breakthrough moment to one of the 
worst in the team’s history.”

Guynes: “That game screwed our 

season up, honestly. We won a lot 
of games still, but I think that game 
put a funk on us as a team and it was 

such a tough week 
afterward because 
that’s all you saw. 
So obviously being 
an 
athlete, 
you 

get home, you’re 
watching 
ESPN, 

and that’s all they 
keep 
showing. 

You’re 
just 
like, 

‘Dude, let’s move 

on to something else.’ That funk 
lingered over that Michigan football 
team for that season.”

Rosenberg: “If they had just held 

on and won that, people would have 
said, ‘Is this the best team in the 
country?’ Because they would have 
accomplished more than anyone 
else. Now, you could argue that these 
things kind of even out — I mean, 
they barely won one the week before, 
and they lost that one — but to lose 
one like that, it was in the stadium, it 
was silence.”

In 
the 
following 
two 
weeks, 

Michigan beat Iowa and Michigan 
State but then welcomed No. 3 Penn 
State to Ann Arbor. Still reeling from 
the Colorado game, the Wolverines 
lost a close one, 31-24, and the Nittany 
Lions finished undefeated to win the 
Big Ten.

Morrison: “We played Penn State, 

which had a fantastic offense that 
year, probably one of the better ones 
ever, and we needed a stop late, and 
we didn’t get it. I can’t help but think 
we just didn’t have a lot of confidence 
in our ability as a team for finishing. 
You can hide that, fake it all you want, 
but I still think it had something to 
do with the way (we lost). I think we 
were a better team than an 8-4 team, 
I really do.”

Michigan’s last two losses came 

against Wisconsin and Ohio State, and 
the Wolverines finished 8-4 by beating 
Colorado State in the Holiday Bowl. 
But the two teams that beat them by 
a touchdown or less — 12-0 Penn State 
and 11-1 Colorado — ended up at Nos. 2 
and 3 in the polls, respectively.

The Buffaloes’ only loss came on 

Oct. 29 against eventual national 
champion Nebraska. The following 
spring, both teams proved their talent 
in the NFL Draft, where Colorado 
had a whopping 10 players selected — 
including Westbrook and Salaam in 
the first round — and Michigan had 
five. Wheatley, Law and offensive 

tackle Trezelle Jenkins were all first-
rounders. The miraculous play that 
connected the teams in college followed 
them for years.

Morrison: 
“Ironically 
enough, 

when I played professionally in 
Indianapolis two years later, my 
roommate was from Colorado. He 
was an offensive lineman. We were 
sitting on the couch that night, and 
he gets his rookie card or baseball 
card delivered to the house, his first 
one, and he starts reading the back. 
And it says something to the effect 
of ‘Helped Colorado beat Michigan 
on a last-second Hail Mary pass by 
leveling hard-charging linebacker 
Steve Morrison.’ I swear to God, it’s 
on his card. Couldn’t make this stuff 
up. And I’m like, ‘You had somebody 
make this. This can’t happen. We’re 
roommates now.’ That was probably 
one of the first times I got a chance 
to actually laugh about it and actually 
put it behind you.”

Most of those involved with the 

game 22 years ago did so, but all of 
them are still left with the sour taste of 
a life-changing defeat.

Tyrone 
Wheatley, 
running 

back, 1991-1994: “I was there and I 
was on the sidelines and I thought 
we had the game won. And to have a 
Detroit native come in the freaking 
building and steal one from us and 
go back to Colorado wasn’t a great 
feel. Just certain things you kind 
of carry with you and it sticks with 
you, and I didn’t play that much in 
that game. You’re just like, ‘Man, 
if I was healthy, maybe could have 
helped a little bit.’ It’s still a bad 
feeling. I think that was also a year 
that we had national contention 
aspirations and things of that such, 
so just a bad taste.”

Morrison: “God bless the Big Ten 

Network, but when that came out, 
that game was on. And people would 
call, ‘Hey, you’re on TV right now! 
And I’m like, ‘Yeah, 
OK. It’s either the 
Michigan 
State 

game 
when 
we 

lost — that, the 
Penn State game 
where we lost or 
the Colorado game. 
Which one is it? 
Because I’m not 
watching 
any 
of 

them. For a long 
time.’ ”

Madej: “We’ve had our fair 

share of great wins. I was on the 
field when Anthony Carter scored 
that touchdown against Indiana. I 
remember in the press box watching 
the catch by Desmond Howard 
against Notre Dame. Last-minute 
field goals, last-minute touchdowns, 
last-minute plays. It goes both ways. 
Sometimes you get the bear, and 
sometimes the bear gets you. And 
unfortunately, that day, the buffalo 
got us.”

Guynes: “Never been in that 

situation since then as a player. I made 
it to the (NFL) and bounced around, 
went to the CFL, NFL Europe, arena 
ball and stuff, so played a lot more 
football after U-M, but nothing to 
that magnitude of emotional ‘What 
the hell?’ And that’s all I can really 
call it is just an emotional ‘What the 
hell just happened?’ ”

In May 1995, eight months after the 

Colorado game, Moeller resigned after 
a drunken incident at a local restaurant. 
His defensive coordinator, Carr, took 
over. Michigan lost four games in 

each of Carr’s first 
two seasons before 
breaking out with 
an 
undefeated 

season and national 
championship 
in 

1997.

Asked 
if 
he 

ever thinks about 
what could have 
happened 
if 
the 

Wolverines 
had 

beaten 
Colorado, 

Moeller said, “Oh, I don’t know. Yeah, 
but they don’t erase ’em and change 
the plays very often. … Boy, if the kids 
could have gotten that one, what a 
great record that could have been, or 
a great win that could be.”

With the tailspin of the Rich 

Rodriguez and Brady Hoke years still 
more than a decade away, the “Miracle 
at 
Michigan” 
didn’t 
permanently 

stunt the team’s momentum, but 
it represented a key point in the 
trajectory of the program.

Rosenberg: “That game might 

have changed the course of Michigan 
football if you think about it. Because 
that team was really good. They 
finished 8-4, which was like the 
apocalypse at that time in Michigan’s 
history. … They lost to Penn State, 
which was one of the two best teams, 
but they were in it with them. I 
don’t know, maybe they go 10-2, or 
whatever it is, and Moeller doesn’t 
feel as stressed and doesn’t have the 
incident next May. Who knows what 
happens? … Even if the incident does 
happen, if they had a better year, 
maybe they keep him.”

The Buffaloes are back in town 

this weekend for the teams’ third 
meeting since that 1994 classic. 
McCartney retired after that season, 
and Colorado has had more than its 
share of struggle in the two decades 
since, going 117-141. The program 
maintained decent success under Rick 
Neuheisel from 1995 to 1998, but it 
has gone through seven head coaches 
since 
McCartney, 
suffered 
four 

double-digit loss seasons and not had 
a winning season since 2005.

And while both programs have 

shifted several times since they created 
a miracle, this weekend’s matchup 
brings back memories for everyone 
who stood in silent Michigan Stadium 
that day.

Falk: “That damn game lives in 

my soul. It really does. Every time 
I see Colorado, every time we play 
Colorado, I want to beat them as bad 
as I can for them to remember the 
day they beat us.”

Breakdown: ‘M’ vs. Colorado

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

After two stress-free wins over 

Hawaii and Central Florida, the 
No. 4 Michigan football team will 
finally face a bigger challenge this 
weekend in the form of Colorado, 
the Wolverines’ first Power Five 
opponent of the season.

Though 
Michigan 
remains 

strongly favored, the Buffaloes 
(2-0) are also coming off a pair 
of routs, trouncing in-state rival 
Colorado State, 44-7, and FCS 
opponent Idaho State, 56-7.

In the spirit of competition, 

neither team has released a depth 
chart this week. The Wolverines 
(2-0) haven’t put one out all season 
— coach Jim Harbaugh recently 
called the practice “outdated” — 
and Colorado responded in kind by 
releasing a mock chart consisting 
of all pop culture figures and even 
some fictional positions, including 
“roamer dude” and “costly safety.”

Unfortunately, the Daily isn’t 

qualified to speculate on new 
quarterback Elmer Fudd’s pocket 
presence, but we will break down 
the matchups we expect to actually 
see on the field Saturday.

Michigan rush offense vs. 
Colorado rush defense

Michigan’s run game had a 

down week against UCF, thanks 
largely to the Knights stacking 
the box and taking away that part 
of the Wolverines’ game. That 
strategy ultimately led to UCF 
getting torched by Speight in the 
play-action passing game, though, 
so Colorado might simply have to 
pick its poison.

Running backs coach Tyrone 

Wheatley and fifth-year senior 
offensive lineman Kyle Kalis weren’t 
at all concerned about the running 
backs’ quiet performance last week 
(just 2.9 yards per carry), saying it 
was more flattering than anything 
that the backs got so much attention 
from the defense. Still, Michigan’s 
stable of backs could stand to prove 
itself against a better defense — 
senior De’Veon Smith is a proven 
bruiser, 
but 
speedy 
freshman 

running back Chris Evans probably 
won’t be seeing many gaps as big 
as the ones he ran through against 
Hawaii two weeks ago.

Getting the best of the Buffaloes’ 

defensive line and linebackers could 
silence some of the running game’s 
doubters. Colorado comes in having 
allowed just 98.5 yards per game, 
good for 30th in the FBS. Granted, 
the Buffaloes’ first two opponents 
carried the ball just 48 total times 
after quickly falling behind on the 
scoreboard. Also, Colorado has just 
10 tackles for loss and three sacks 
(for reference, Michigan has 22 

and seven, respectively, while UCF 
had eight tackles for loss last week 
alone).

Expect the Wolverines’ backs to 

snap out of it against a run defense 
that hasn’t really been tested yet 
this season.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan pass offense vs. 
Colorado pass defense

Redshirt sophomore quarterback 

Wilton Speight has had about as 
strong a start as can be expected, 
throwing 
for 
457 
yards 
and 

tying a season-opening program 
record with seven touchdowns 
in two games. He hasn’t made a 
major mistake since throwing an 
interception on his first play as 
the starter, and he has proven that 
he’s capable of making plays under 
duress, like when he turned a near-
sack into an 8-yard dump-off pass 
to redshirt junior fullback Henry 
Poggi last week.

The 
Buffaloes’ 
secondary 

should be a huge step up from 
what the Wolverines have seen so 
far, though. Cornerback Chidobe 
Awuzie is an NFL-level player who 
had 85 tackles, seven pass breakups 
and two interceptions last season, 
and he already has one pick to his 
credit this year. Awuzie can’t cover 
three receivers at once, though, 
and Speight has to like his chances 
if any of the three find themselves 
in a one-on-one matchup.

Edge: Michigan

Colorado rush offense vs. 
Michigan rush defense

The Wolverines’ run defense 

allowed UCF to pick up 275 yards on 
the ground last week — most of them 
on a few big plays, like an 87-yard 
touchdown run in the second 
quarter and a few quarterback 
scrambles. When asked about it 
earlier this week, both fifth-year 
senior defensive tackle Matt Godin 
and redshirt sophomore defensive 
end Chase Winovich identified 
communication issues as the main 
culprit.

Michigan will have to be careful 

not to allow a repeat performance, 
as 
Colorado 
quarterback 
Sefo 

Liufau has a proven ability to 
scramble out of the pocket. The 
junior quarterback ran for 266 yards 
and five touchdowns in 2015 and 
already has 120 yards and a score in 

two games this year. The Buffaloes 
use a stable of backs, with Phillip 
Lindsay and Kyle Evans getting the 
bulk of the carries, but have no real 
standout runners. Still, the group as 
a whole has averaged 261 yards in 
their first two games.

After having a week to clean 

up their mistakes though, the 
Wolverines’ elite defensive line 
and solid linebacking corps should 
be able to play up to their usual 
standard this week.

Edge: Michigan

Colorado pass offense vs. 
Michigan pass defense

Michigan is still missing senior 

All-American cornerback Jourdan 
Lewis, but the rest of the secondary 
has more than made up for his 
absence at this point in the season. 
He remains questionable for this 
weekend, but senior cornerback 
Channing Stribling, fifth-year senior 
cornerback Jeremy Clark and senior 
safeties Delano Hill and Dymonte 
Thomas have allowed the ninth-
fewest passing yards per game in the 
country even without him.

Like the Wolverines, though, 

Liufau has a three-headed monster 
of receiving targets at his disposal. 
Receivers 
Shay 
Fields, 
Devin 

Ross and Bryce Bobo each have 
eclipsed the 100-yard mark already 
this season, meaning Michigan’s 
secondary will have its hands full.

The Wolverines have yet to 

allow a reception of longer than 
28 yards this season, but it’s a safe 
bet the Buffaloes are poised to 
change that this weekend. Lewis 
or no Lewis, this will be the biggest 
test Michigan’s defensive backs 
have faced all year, but a wealth of 
game experience makes them well-
equipped to handle it.

Special teams

Apart from one dropped snap 

by fifth-year senior kicker/punter 
Kenny 
Allen, 
the 
Wolverines 

had a near-perfect performance 
on 
special 
teams 
last 
week. 

Sophomore safety Tyree Kinnel 
got his fingers on two punts, while 
fifth-year senior defensive lineman 
Chris 
Wormley 
blocked 
one 

field goal and altered the path of 
another. Michigan also recovered 
a fumble on a kickoff and had 
redshirt 
sophomore 
linebacker 

Jabrill Peppers return a punt all 
the way to the 12-yard line, while 
Allen went 3-for-3 on field goals to 
remain perfect for the season.

The Buffaloes haven’t had many 

spectacular displays on special 
teams so far this season, ranking 
68th in the country in ESPN’s 
special teams efficiency metric. 
Kicker Diego Gonzalez is 3-for-3 on 
field goals this season, but he has yet 
to try a kick longer than 30 yards.

Last season, though, Colorado 

struggled 
immensely 
in 
this 

area. Gonzalez was just 18-for-29 
on field goals and the Buffaloes 
had field goals blocked in losing 
efforts against USC and Utah. The 
Wolverines are not likely to be a 
good matchup for this unit.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

For the second straight week, 

most of the talk surrounding 
Michigan’s opponent has stemmed 
from events that occurred 20 
years ago. After former Nebraska 
quarterback and current UCF 
coach Scott Frost resurrected 
memories of the 1997 national 
championship 
controversy 
last 

week, the Buffaloes now bring 
memories of the “Miracle at 
Michigan” — a 64-yard Hail Mary 
touchdown pass from Kordell 
Stewart that guided Colorado to an 
upset of the Wolverines in its last 
visit to Ann Arbor in 1994.

No one at Michigan has had much 

to say about the game — less than 
a quarter of players on the roster 
were even alive when it happened 
in the first place — but the Buffaloes 
certainly haven’t forgotten about 
it, opting to wear 1994 throwback 
jerseys on Saturday.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
have 

coincidentally entered both games 
being ranked fourth in the country, 
but this is far from the same 
Colorado team that was ranked 
seventh 22 years ago. Michigan 
has the second-highest combined 
margin of victory in the country, 
and Harbaugh has made it clear that 
the Wolverines aren’t taking the 
Buffaloes lightly with the Big Ten 
schedule on the horizon. Michigan 
has too much at stake to let a similar 
letdown happen this weekend.

What to Watch For: Secondary, 
Michigan run game, miracles

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

As the No. 4 Michigan football 

team gets ready for its third 
straight 
game 
at 
Michigan 

Stadium, the preparation will 
be slightly different this time 
around. The Wolverines (2-0) 
were heavy favorites over both 
Hawaii and Central Florida, and 
though they’re still a 20-point 
favorite 
over 
Colorado, 
the 

margin is significantly smaller 
than the ones they have had in 
prior weeks. 

Michigan 
coasted 
against 

Hawaii, winning by 60 points, 
and was challenged slightly more 
by Central Florida the following 
week but still ran away with a 
51-14 victory. Now, the Buffaloes 
pose the Wolverines’ first real 
threat of the season. 

Here’s what to watch for on 

Saturday:

1. How does Michigan’s 

secondary hold up against 

talented receivers?

Secondary coach Mike Zordich 

has a lot of talent in their group, and 
it has shown in the first two games. 
Against Hawaii, senior safety 
Delano Hill and senior cornerback 
Channing Stribling each recorded 
pick-sixes, and the following week, 
sophomore safety Tyree Kinnel 
showed his athleticism on special 
teams by getting a hand on two 
different punts. 

Though the secondary has 

excelled so far this season, 
Zordich knows that Colorado will 
put up more of a battle.

“They’re better receivers and 

the quarterback is a much better 
quarterback,” Zordich said. “He’s 
a guy that actually has time to 
throw, and he’s got three or four 
good guys to throw to.”

The secondary fared well in 

each game, despite the most 
talented member of the group 
missing both. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said that senior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis sat 
out against UCF due to an injury 
different from the one that kept 
him out of the Hawaii game, 
which doesn’t bode well for 
Lewis. As of Wednesday, he was 

still working with the trainer, 
but anything could happen come 
Saturday.

2. Which part of the offense 

will the Buffaloes target?

Much to the fanbase’s chagrin, 

Michigan’s 
running 
game 

sputtered 
against 
UCF. 
The 

Knights loaded the box with five 
to six players at all times, forcing 
the Wolverines to go through the 
air. Redshirt sophomore Wilton 
Speight ultimately was able to 
get the job done, throwing for 
312 yards and four touchdowns, 
proving that Michigan’s offense 
can succeed either way.

But 
Saturday’s 
game 
will 

provide 
a 
tougher 
test 
for 

the offense and could expose 
potential weak points. Colorado 
was able to stifle Colorado State 

and Idaho State’s attack, holding 
each team to a touchdown apiece 
an average of 2.7 yards per play. 
Its opponents were also only 
able to convert on third down 23 
percent of the time, and though 
Michigan’s 
a 
much 
different 

competitor 
than 
what 
the 

Buffaloes have seen so far, the 
numbers speak for themselves.

3. Running game concern?

If the running game still 

struggles despite less pressure in 
the box, it may actually be time 
for fans to start worrying. 

Michigan averaged just 2.9 yards 

per carry against UCF, but had 
no such trouble against Hawaii. 
Led by true freshman running 
back Chris Evans, the Wolverines 
opened the season by rushing for 
306 yards on 39 attempts.

Tuesday, 
fifth-year 
senior 

offensive lineman Kyle Kalis 
told fans to calm down about the 
running game, and Wednesday, 
running backs coach Tyrone 
Wheatley echoed the sentiment. 
He was flattered that the Knights 
took notice of the running game 
enough to load the box like 
that, taking it to mean that the 
Wolverines 
have 
nothing 
to 

worry about. 

4. Will “Miracle at Michigan” 

memories be refreshed?

Though this will be just the 

fifth meeting between Michigan 
and Colorado, a great deal of 
history surrounds the matchup.

In 
1994, 
the 
“Miracle 
at 

Michigan” 
stunned 
a 
near-

empty Big House. The Buffaloes 
scored two touchdowns in the 

final 2:16 of the game, with the 
final score coming on a 64-yard 
Hail Mary pass to end the game. 
The Colorado receiver, Michael 
Westbrook, was a Detroit native, 
and that made things sting even 
more for Wheatley, who was a 
running back for the Wolverines 
at the time.

“(I don’t want to talk about it) 

because I was there and I was 
on the sideline and I thought we 
had the game won,” Wheatley 
said. “To have a Detroit native 
come in the freakin’ building 
and steal one from us and go 
back to Colorado wasn’t a great 
feeling.”

The Buffaloes definitely haven’t 

forgotten it, and they won’t 
on Saturday, either — they’ve 
already announced that they 
will be wearing 1994 throwback 
uniforms this weekend.
