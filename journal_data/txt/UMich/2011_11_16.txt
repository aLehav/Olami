STATE LEGISLATION
'U' opposes
elimination
of partner
benefits bill

Inletter to Senate,
Coleman, Hanlon
decry bills that
rid health benefits
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily Staff Reporter
In defense of employees
with same-sex partners, Uni-
versity officials are fighting
against potential state legis-
lation that would eliminate
domestic partner benefits.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman and University
Provost Philip Hanlon sent a
letter to Michigan state sena-
tors on Nov. 8 that expresses
their opposition to House Bills
4770 and 4771, which would
prohibit the University and
other public entities in the
state from offering benefits to
domestic partners. House Bill
4770 passed in the state House
of Representatives on Sept. 15,
but is currently latent pending
a vote on House Bill 4771 in the
Senate.
"There is no evidence (elim-
inating benefits) will reduce

health care costs," Coleman
and Hanlon wrote.
If passed by the state Sen-
ate, same-sex partners of pub-
lic employees would lose their
health insurance and, accord-
ing to Coleman and Hanlon,
the bill would hinder the
University's ability to recruit
talented faculty members.
Coleman and- Hanlon wrote
in the letter addressed to state
Senate Majority Leader Randy
Richardville (R-Monroe) that
if the University can't offer
benefits to domestic partners
it would have a hiring disad-
vantage compared to institu-
tions in other states.
"Fortune 500 companies
nationwide and in the state of
Michigan offer partner ben-
efits: It is simply good business
that produces an excellent
return on investment," Cole-
man and Hanlon wrote in the
letter.
The University provided
domestic partner benefits to
570 qualified adults and 48
dependent children this year.
On average, the cost of the ben-
efits is $3,072 per person and 0.7
percent of the University's total

Panel organized
by Washtenaw
Community
Action Team
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Maureen Taylor, state chair
of the Michigan Welfare Rights
Organization, unwittingly
boarded a train a few weeks

ago to Oakland, Calif. from San
Francisco and stumbled upon
the city's Occupy encampment.
The protesters were, at the time,
striving to shut down the port of
Oakland, and as Taylor arrived
and watched them the next four
hours, they succeeded.
At a Social Forum on Rebuild-
ing Working People's Power - a
panel discussion organized by the
Washtenaw Community Action
Team - Taylor spoke last night
about rising unemployment, the
decline of the manufacturing sec-

tor and the state's cutting of wel-
fare beiefits..
Taylor lauded the Occupy
movement as one that has suc-
ceeded in being accessible to aver-
age people. She said corporations
and the rich have benefitted from
the financial crisis at the expense
of the working class.
"This is going to require
a change in philosophy, and
that's why Occupy is so doggone
impressive," Taylor said. "Occupy
doesn't have any rules. They've
got a vision, and the vision is that

we have to do something about
corporategreed.".
Taylor was joined by fellow
panelists Jane Slaughter, a labor
journalist and activist, and Tom
Weisskopf, a University professor
emeritus of economics. Each pan-
elist delivered 15-minute speech-
es to a room of about 70 students,
Ann Arbor residents, Occupy Ann
Arbor members and WCAT orga-
nizers.
Weisskopf discussed the eco-
nomic origin of the financial cri-

Six students plus
write-ins running
for two open seats
on committee
By YOUNJOO SANG
Daily Staff Reporter
Despite a lack of student
interest in the past, six students
and an unknown number of
write-in candidates are vying

for a seat on the University's
Department of Public Safety
Oversight Committee.
In this week's Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly election, the
candidates are running for two
student seats on the DPS Over-
sight Committee, an advisory
group comprised of two faculty
members, two staff members
and two students who are in
charge of making recommen-
dations to University officials
about grievances filed against
DPS officers. The election began

yesterday and ends tomorrow at
11:59 p.m.
Only one student, LSA senior
Ellen Steele, ran for the posi-
tion in the winter election. She
and LSA senior Michael Pry, a
write-in candidate in the win-
ter election, currently hold the
positions. Neither Steele nor
Pry are running for their posi-
tions again. In order for the
committee to operate accord-
ing to state law, at least two new
student members will need to be

Daily StaffReporter
With elections starting today,
16 students are campaigning in
hopes of securing 10 of the open
representative seats in LSA Stu-

dent Government.
LSA-SG President Anne
Laverty wrote in an e-mail
interview that this semester's
candidate pool is a diverse
group reflecting a variety of
backgrounds and perspectives.
The candidates, who range
from freshmen to seniors, are
focused on different issues in.
the areas of academics and stu-
dent life, according to Laverty.
"The candidates have a vari-

ety of experience on LSA-SG,
which only enhances the elec-
tion process because this allows
for a greater array of platforms
and perspectives," Laverty
wrote. "I am enthusiastic to see
such variety and know that any
of these candidates have the
capacity and passion to affect
change on this campus."

M-Fly, a student club that
builds aircrafts for competi-
tion, takes engineering to new
heights.
M-Fly's members design,
build and fly remote-con-
trolled aircrafts and compete
each year in the Society of
Automotive Engineers Aero
Design Competition. Accord-
ing to Engineering junior Jor-
dan Hall, M-Fly president, the
organization gives students
the opportunity to apply con-
cepts learned in class to the
real world.
"I joined M-Fly because it
was a chance for me to apply
the things I'd learned in the
classroom to hands-on expe-

rience," Hall said. "It's nice
to see how this sort of thing
actually works."
Hall said that though the
club, which is a Society of
Automotive Engineers team,
is open to all majors, it is
mostly comprised of Engi-
neering students.
The nearly 40-member
M-Fly team works through-
out the year to build a plane
for eight of their members
to compete at the SAE Aero
Design Competition. This
year, the team will partici-
pate in the West competition
in California from March 16
to 18.
Last year, the majority of

the fall semester was devoted
to designing the plane, which
left little time for building the
aircraft. This year M-Fly is
planning a more basic design
so the team members can start
building sooner. Engineer-
ing junior Josh Matthews,
M-Fly's chief engineer, said
this allows more time to make
changes after test flights.
Matthews attended the
competition last year and said
the club's hard work is worth
it whenthe final producttakes
flight.
"It all becomes real at the
point where the airplane flies
for the first time," he said.

budget, or $1.9 million out of $302
million, according to the letter.
Senate Minority Leader Gretchen
Whitmer (D-East Lansing) is one of
the 37 state Senators who received
the letter. She said she is adamant-
ly opposed to the efforts to scale
back benefits for domestic partners
because she also thinks it will have
a "chilling effect" on the University's
ability to bring in the "best and the
brightest" researchers.
"(The effort to eliminate bene-
fits) sends a message that Michigan
is intolerant and not interested in
being a serious contender... for peo-
ple that are doing the best things in
their field," Whitmer said.
Whitmer commended Coleman
and Hanlon for doing "the right
thing" by sending a letter voicing
their concerns with the House bills.

Richardville could not be reached
for comment after multiple inqui-
ries.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the fact that Coleman
and Hanlon wrote the letter demon-
strates the significance of the issue
to the University. He added that
Coleman and Hanlon want the sena-
tors to know what the anticipated
consequences would be if the bills
pass both chambers.
"They both felt it was very impor-
tant that the senators hear from the
University of Michigan directly,"
Fitzgerald said.
Already some if their domestic
partner benefits are eliminated.
Whitmer said the bills are not jus-
tified and are instead an effort to dis-
tract the state from more important
issues like unemployment, which
was at 11.1 percent in Michigan as of
Sept. 2011, according the the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
"It's like the bullying issue," Whit-

mer said, referring to a bill passed
in the state Senate on Nov. 2, which
contains a clause offering what some
legislators say is legal protection for
bullies.
"When you focus on one small
social issue, you endure all the evi-
dence that shows it's going to have
much bigger ramifications to our
detriment," Whitmer said.
Kate Barald, chair of the Senate
Advisory Committee on University
Affairs, wrote in an e-mail interview
that lead faculty body agrees with
the content of Coleman and Hanlon's
letter and recently passed a unani-
mous resolution condoning the two
bills. The University's Senate Assem-
bly passed a similar resolution with a
vote of 49-1.
"This letter is essentially what
both our SACUA resolution ... and the
Senate Assembly resolution (said),"
Barald wrote. "We on SACUA, of
course, endorse (the) letter, unani-
mously."

sis by presenting income and wealth
inequalities like the ratio of salaries
for CEOs to workers' wages, which he
says grew exponentially between 1970
and 2006. In particular, Weisskopf
saidhedisapprovesofthelackofsocial
mobility in the United States - some-
thing he said the country previously
led the world in, but has since fallen
behind in because of the "the erosion
of socially accepted norms of fair pay,"
the shrinking manufacturing sector,
the declining purchasing power of the
minimum wage and decreasing power
of trade unions as a result of legisla-
tion.
In an interview after the forum,
Weisskopf said he hopes University
administrators and faculty use their
knowledge about the issues to help
change the economic system.
"It's their responsibility as well
as everybody else's to do something
about it," he said. "We've come to
a point, I think, where we need to
devote some of our time to political
activism."
Though Weisskopf said he does not
think the Occupy movement can pro-
duce major changes by itself, others
said they were impressed by the gains
it has shown in just a few months.
Slaughter said the accomplishments
of the movement outpace those of
A4

unions, which have been trying to
fight corporate greed for decades. Last
year, unions recorded their second
lowest total number of strikes in his-
tory, second only to the year before,
accordingto Slaughter.
Organizers of the forum and Uni-
versity students who attended said
they would like to see the Occupy Ann
Arbor movement reach out more to
otherlocal groups.
In an interview after the event, LSA
and Art & Design junior Ian Match-
ett said he would like to see Occupy
Ann Arbor members coordinate more.,
with the University's chapter of Col-
lege Democrats and Students Allied
for Freedom and Equality - a campus
group that advocates for human rights
for Palestinians.
The forum also included a com-
ponent in which attendees split into
groups to discuss issues of local
importance and ways to solve them.
Matchett and others said the forum
was important in bringing together
individuals.
"It's the movement of the 99 per-
cent, not the 10 percent who are here
and the 10 percent who are there,"
Matchett said.
LSA junior Greta Taylor said
she appreciated the opportunity to
exchange ideas with others and hopes
the event will facilitate more dialogue.
"When on Earth would these peo-
ple all get together at a different time
to talk about something as important
as social justice?" Taylor asked. "This

is why something like this is impor-
tant. It's getting everybody together
and getting the information and doing
something about it."
Adam Warner, a WCAT organizer
who coordinated and led the forum,
said in an interview after the event
that he hopes it stimulates conversa-
tion about the suffering of the poor.
Warner pointed to what he said was
the inordinate influence of corpora-
tions in politics as a factor in govern-
mental policy that doesn't favor the
lower class. However, Warner added
that he could not predictwhat impacts
the movement might have.
"We know that there are people
who are suffering out there," War-
ner said. "We know that there are
problems. The only way we're going
to address them is by talking to each
other to see how they are articulat-
ed."
Police subdued Occupy movement
camps nationwide yesterday includ-
ing Zuccotti Park, where members
of Occupy Wall Street have been sta-
tioned since September. New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg authorized
the eviction of the park onthegrounds
that it wasn't meeting health and safe-
ty standards, The Associated Press
reported.
Still, Warner, like the ousted pro-
testers in New York, said he was dis-
mayed but not discouraged by the
nationwide evictions.
"As they say, you can't evict an idea
whose time has come," Warner said.

Judge rules free
speech does not
justify protests
NEW YORK (AP) -
Crackdowns against the
Occupy Wall Street encamp-
ments across the country
reached the epicenter of the
movement yesterday, when
police rousted protesters
from a Manhattan park and
a judge ruled that their free
speech rights do not extend
to pitching a tent and set-
ting up camp for months at
a time.
It was a potentially dev-
astating setback. If crowds
of demonstrators return to
Zuccotti Park, they will not
be allowed to bring tents,
sleeping bags and other
equipment that turned the
area into a makeshift city of
dissent.
But demonstrators
pledged to carry on with
their message protesting
corporate greed and eco-
nomic inequality, either in
Zuccotti or a yet-to-be cho-
sen new home.
"This is much bigger

than a square plaza in
downtown Manhattan,"
said Hans Shan, an orga-
nizer who was working
with churches to find plac-
es for protesters to sleep.
"You can't evict an idea
whose time has come."
State Supreme Court
Justice Michael Stallman
upheld the city's eviction
of the protesters after an
emergency appeal by the
National Lawyers Guild.
The protesters have been
camped out in the privately
owned park since mid-
September. Mayor Michael
Bloomberg said he ordered
the sweep because health
and safety conditions had
become "intolerable" in the
crowded plaza. The raid was
conducted in the middle
of the night "to reduce the
risk of confrontation" and
"to minimize disruption to
the surrounding neighbor-
hood," he said.
By early yesterday eve-
ning, some protesters were
being allowed back into the
park two by two. But they
could each take only a small
bag.
Still, some protesters

believed the loss of Zuccotti
Park may be an opportunity
to broaden and decentralize
the protest to give it staying
power.
"People are really recog-
nizing that we need to build
a movement here," Shan
said. "What we're dedicated
to is not just about occupy-
ing space. That's a tactic."
But without a place to
congregate, protesters will
have a harder time commu-
nicating with each other en
masse. The leaders of the
movement spent most of
Tuesday gathering in small
groups throughout the city
- in church basements and
on street corners - and
relaying plans in scattered
text messages and email.
Robert Harrington,
owner of a small importing
business in New York, stood
outside the barricade with
a sign calling for tighter
banking regulations.
"To be effective it almost
has to move out of the park,"
Harrington said. "It's like
the antiwar movement in
the '60s, which started as
street theater and grew into
something else."

Snyder signs sex
offender license,
bowling bills
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder
has signed three bills making it
easier to permanently revoke the
licenses of health care profession-
als who commit criminal sexual
conduct, and a fourth measure
protecting bowling alleys whose
customers fall while wearing
bowling shoes outside.
Snyder's office says he signed
the bills yesterday.
One bill allows for the per-
manent license or registration
revocation for health care profes-
sionals convicted of first-, second-
or third-degree criminal sexual
conduct. Another lets offenders
seek reinstatement only if their
convictions are for fourth-degree
offenses or for intent to commit
criminal sexual conduct.

an effort to improve campus sus-
tainability.
"I want to make student life
easier and more enjoyable while
making the campus more sus-
tainable," he wrote.
Hoffman added that his inter-
est in student government began
when he arrivei on campus and
it comes from his desire to help
spur change. Hoffman wrote
that though he is still new to
campus, he feels his previous
experience in high school stu-
dent government will help him
in the position.
"Although this is my first
semester at Michigan, I have
already attended a few general
meetings, and I'm actively par-
ticipating on the Communica-
tions Committee right now,"
Hoffman wrote.
LSA freshman Kendall John-
son, who is also running for
a position, wrote in an e-mail
interview that she decided to
run because she feels passion-
ate about representing students
and making sure their voices
are heard. If elected, Johnson
said she plans to help implement
programs geared toward student
health. As part of this initiative,
she would plan seminars to edu-

will win a $100 prize.
Engineering senior Matt
Friedrichs introduced the
competition to the Univer-
sity following his participa-
tion in a summer internship
in 2010 with the founders of
the Kill-A-Watt competition
at the University of Central
Florida.
"(The competition was
about) getting involved in
the environmental movement
on campus," Friedrichs said.
"I saw it as something (our)
campus lacked and thought it
would be a valuable addition
to campus."
According to Friedrichs,
the competition has been suc-
cessful at the University of
Central Florida and resulted
in a 10 to 15-percent reduc-
tion in energy consumption.
Friedrichs said he hopes to
see similar results on the Uni-
versity's campus, though he
does not anticipate dramatic
or immediate change.
"We just want to raise as
much awareness and thought

about these issues as pos-
sible," Friedrichs said. "(I
expect) moderate energy
reduction, not substantial,
and students being more
aware of energy use in gen-
eral."
University Housing
spokesman Peter Logan
said the competition should
inspire a more environmen-
tally-conscious mindset in
students.
"It's certainly a good way to
engage the students in think-
ing in terms of how they, indi-
vidually and as a community,
can help conserve energy and
be more sustainable in prac-
tice in terms of daily living,"
Logan said.
LSA senior Katie Kent, co-
founder of Kill-A-Watt, said
the goal of the competition
is to provide an easy way for
students to join the environ-
mental movement. She said
there are a variety of ways
students can contribute to
energy reduction in their resi-
dence halls.
"(Students can do) simple
actions like turning off lights
in common areas, unplugging
devices not in use like cell
phone chargers or Xboxes,
coming to Kill-A-Watt events
and learning more about it
and spreading the word,"
Kent said.

cate students on health issues
in addition to arranging for free
miniature hand sanitizers and
tissue boxes to be passed out to
students.
Though this is Trupp's first
time running for an LSA-SG
position, she said she has been
involved with the organization
since her freshman year when
she got involved with LSA-SG's
Taking Responsibility for the
Earth and Environment Sub-
committee, or TREES.
Trupp said her position as
vice chair of TREES has helped
her realize the impact she can
make working with members of
LSA-SG.
"I would really like to contin-
ue being a representative on stu-
dent government to give others
a voice that they don't have and
also have my input in student
government," Trupp said.
She added that her election
platform focuses on improving
communication within LSA-SG
and between LSA-SG and the
student body. Trupp said she
wants to start holding town hall
meetings where students can
ask questions and voice their
opinions about LSA-SG initia-
tives.
"The things that we do as
student government are for the
students, so if they're not happy
about what we're doing, then
we're not doing our job," Trupp
said.
Similarly, LSA-SG Vice Presi-
dent Jeffrey Larkin said he and
other members of LSA-SG want
to hold college-wide town halls
and round tables to get student
input on which measures the
student government should
focus on.
"LSA-SG is a great resource
for all LSA students, and we're
always trying to strengthen and
broaden that resource," Larkin
said.
Larkin said he is excited
about the large candidate pool

and the wide range of represen-
tation among existing student
government members and new
candidates. According to Lar-
kin, this semester's candidate
pool is the largest in more than
three years.
"It's always nice to have a lot
of people interested, and I think
it shows that there are students
that take a very vested interest
in their education and obviously
want to see things improve,"
Larkin said.
Larkin added that because
there are so many projects and
initiatives - ranging from com-
munication with constituents
to academic projects and cam-
pus life - within the LSA-SG
domain, there's a place for every-
one to get involved.
"I think that when you bring
a wide range of ideas to the
table, that's what makes student
government special in a sense
because no two people are the
same, and that's what brings us
different project ideas and a lot
of perspectives on the work,"
Larkin said.
The other candidates run-
ning for seats on LSA-SG did
not respond to several inquiries
from The Michigan Daily.
In addition to voting for can-
didates in this week's election,
LSA students will have the
chance to answer three ballot
questions regarding their expe-
riences as undergraduates in
the college. The ballot questions
ask student views on a potential
minor. in the School of Art &
Design for LSA students, what
buildings students would want
to see water bottle refill stations
in and whether students would
want to receive an automatic
notification from Wolverine
Access when grades are posted.
The election began last night
at midnight and polls will close
at 11:59 p.m. tomorrow. Students
can cast their ballot at vote.

COMMITTEE
From Page 1A
elected to the committee.
MSA President DeAndree
Watson said he believes more
candidates are interested in run-
ning for the position this semes-
ter because MSA has successfully
publicized the vacancies. In an
attempt to make students aware
of the openings, MSA e-mailed
the University student body to
encourage them to apply. MSA
cannot control who runs for the
election or choose candidates -
which the assembly did before
2009 when The Michigan Daily
reported that the nomination
process for the committee was in
violation of state law.
"We don't control (the) num-
ber of students," Watson said.
"We only notify students that
the election is coming. It really
depends on the student body."
LSA sophomore Lucy Zhao,
a candidate for the DPS Over-
sight Committee, wrote in an
e-mail interview that she found
out about MSA on her first day
on campus. She wrote that she
wanted to get involved in stu-
dent government to impact the
campus community.
Zhao added that she has
joined various student govern-
ment commissions and decided
to run for the DPS Oversight
Committee because she is pas-
sionate about equality.
"Students are not always able
to have their voice heard in deal-
ing with the authority ofthe DPS
officers," Zhao wrote. "I want to
change this. I want to hear what
students think and have the abil-
ity to make a difference in the

way that they experience this
campus."
Public Policy junior Brock
Grosso, a write-in candidate for
the DPS Oversight Committee,
said he is interested in issues
related to civil liberty, crimi-
nal justice and policing. Grosso
said he thinks working with the
DPS Oversight Committee could
allow him to affect how these
issues play out on campus.
"I wanted to help students
with liberties and thought the
DPS Oversight Committee
would be the place for it," Grosso
said.
He added that with the recent
assault cases on and near cam-
pus, the committee could pro-
vide a voice for students and
cultivate increased transparency
between students and police on
campus.
"I want to improve com-
munication lines between DPS
and the students," Grosso said.
"I want them to feel comfort-
able going to DPS for concerns.
I want to foster that relation-
ship."
Engineering freshman Timo-
thy Newberger, also a candidate
for the committee, wrote in an
e-mail interview that he read
about the committee's vacancies
in the Daily.
"I found this bizarre consid-
ering the large size of the Uni-
versity and decided it would be
best if someone filled the empty
spots," wrote Newberger, who is
also running for an MSA repre-
sentative spot.
The other candidates running
for the DPS Oversight Commit-
tee seats did not respond to sev-
eral interview requests from The
Michigan Daily.

Liberty for all?
Pledge shouldn't be mandated in public schools
tate lawmakers are apparently very concerned about dis-
plays of patriotism by students in Michigan. The state Senate
recently passed a bill that would require all public schools to
recite the Pledge of Allegiance each school day. The bill is an attack
on free speech in Michigan's public schools, and Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder should not allow it to become law.

The Type 3 gaffe

n the modern American news
media's coverage of politics,
every event
needs a narrative
so that people
keep watching.
Whenever a
candidate for
an office says or
does something,
pundits acrossD
the country rush DAR-WEI
to label what CHEN
happened or out-
line the ramifi-
cations of said event. One of these
labels is called the "gaffe."
For political purposes, gaffes can
assume a few forms. Sometimes
a politician will accidentally say
something that doesn't accurately
portray what he or she actually
thinks. One example of this form is
Republican presidential candidate
Herman Cain's latest statement
about the sexual misconduct allega-
tions coming from various women
he's worked with: "For every one
person that comes forward with a
false accusation, there are probably
thousands who will say that none
of that sort of activity ever came
from Herman Cain." Many comedi-
ans and liberal analysts are having
field days with this quote because
it seems to imply that Cain is using
the "I've only groped a few women"
defense, butI will defend Cain here.
What he probably meant was: The
vast majority of people who know
Cain would say that he's not capable
of such misconduct.
Other times, a politician says
something he clearly believes, but
states it in such an awkward man-
ner that the candidate's clumsiness
overshadows the message. Republi-
can presidential candidate Rick San-
torum has become famous for one
particular incident where he had
one of these gaffes. On a campaign
stop in Iowa earlier this summer,
Santorum pointed to a napkin on a

table and stated, "This is a napkin -
I can call this napkin a paper towel,
but it is a napkin," making the case
that gay marriage is actual marriage
to the same extent that napkins are
paper towels. His main point is clear
(gay marriages are not legitimate),
but the news media covered this epi-
sode as a gaffe because the analogy
was such a strange one.
The funny thing about this year's
GOP presidential nomination pro-
cess is the invention of a new type
of gaffe (let's call these "Type 3
gaffes"). Type 3 gaffes happen
when politicians clearly and sen-
sibly delineate what they believe,
but receive backlash because their
opinions run counter to all cred-
ible research or mainstream public
opinion. During the summer cam-
paign season, Republican presiden-
tial candidate Rick Perry talked to a
young boy in Iowa about how "evo-
lution is a theory that's out there ...
it's got some gaps," and with respect
to the evolution-creationism debate,
"You're smart enough to figure out
which one is right." Some media
members pounced on these quotes,
tagging them as gaffes from Perry
(Type 3), even though few in Repub-
lican circles believe in evolution to
begin with.
I cannot bring myself to accept
this incident as a mere gaffe. To
me, a gaffe involves a mistake.
Remember what happened in the
GOP debate last week when Perry
couldn't name the third government
agency he'd eliminate? That's agaffe
because his memory lapsed, and he
couldn't locate his notes (and it's
inconsequential because he'll have
his notes if he becomes president
of the United States). On the other
hand, what Perry said on evolution
is what he meant exactly. The media
does everyone a disservice by using
the gaffe label because what Perry
says will have very real consequenc-
es if he wins the presidency.
GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney

also had a Type 3 gaffe this sum-
mer when he infamously said "cor-
porations are people." With citizens
struggling across the country and
corporations earning record profits,
many people took offense because
corporations cannot be treated like
people, especially with the economy
in bad shape. This quote was labeled
a gaffe by many in the media, but
Romney honestly meant what he
said and how he said it.
Unfiltered looks
at GOP candidate
comments.
When the media calls something
agaffe, they seemto imply that there
was something inadvertent about
it. The "gaffe" label also too eas-
ily sweeps nonsensical statements
under the rug when substantive
policy discussions arise. Nothing
was inadvertent about Perry's state-
ments on evolution and Romney's
statements on corporate person-
hood. These Type 3 "gaffes" have
serious consequences, such as teach-
ing schoolchildren pseudoscience or
allocating the country's resources
inefficiently. Sure, President Barack
Obama has once said that he's vis-
ited 57 states (Perry supporters are
happy to tell you about this), but
unless he's going to waste federal
money on imaginary states, his gaffe
will have no tangible consequenc-
es. I don't know what to call them,
but maybe Type 3 gaffes should be
named something else that reflects *
how terrifying they are. Maybe
"unfiltered looks at Perry and Rom-
ney" will do.

In addition to the required recitation of
the pledge, the bill mandates that schools
purchase an American flag for each class-
room and ensure that it is on display. The bill
passed in the Senate on Nov. 10 with a 31-5
vote. While most members of the Republi-
can-led Senate voted in favor of the bill, some
expressed concerns about whether it would
foster love for one's country.
The bill would force students to recite the
pledge, potentially against their will, and is a
violation of free speech rights in schools. The
bill does provide an opt-out policy in which
students would not be mandated to recite
the pledge if they or their parents object. But
while students technically have the option to
not participate, the pressure they will likely
face from peers and teachers will place a bur-
den on them to make this choice.
Lawmakers are under the impression that
forcing students to recite the pledge each
school day will teach students American val-
ues and their importance. The pledge cer-
tainly features buzzwords that represent the
country's value system, but whether or not
the words teach students anything is debat-_
able. In reality, forcing students to robotically
recite the pledge without teaching them what
it means or why they are saying it strips the
pledge of all meaning, instead of making it a

beacon of patriotism as lawmakers intend.
The appropriate way to encourage stu-
dents to state the pledge is through educa-
tion. Michigan schools should teach students
what the pledge means and why it is thought
to be important. After students have learned
about the pledge, they can make their own
educated decision about whether or not to
recite it. But this should be done with older
students - not third-graders who may not
understand the impact of their words. Forc-
ing the recitation of the pledge not only voids
it of meaning, but it discourages freethinking
and personal decision-making among young
people.
Every minute that is spent debating and
voting on this bill is a slap in the face to the
thousands of unemployed people throughout
Michigan who are looking for help from their
lawmakers. Legislators need to stop wast-
ing time and resources on arbitrary bills and
show a commitment to legislation that will
increase Michigan's economic strength.
While ensuring first-graders are patriotic
is a noble goal, Michigan lawmakers should
consider focusing on rebuilding the economy
and creating jobs. Public school administrators
should handle the task of overseeing the Pledge
of Allegiance, and state lawmakers should
begin tackling Michigan's real problems.

Lea.ving leasing for later

What the frack?'

Simply put, housing is a mess. It's a big-
ger mess than a front lawn the morning after
game day. It's more complicated than a biol-
ogy exam the day after Halloween. Most
stressful of all, thoughts of where to live, who
to room with, what to pay for and which com-
panies to deal with engulf students' minds. If
first-year students haven't already found an
apartment or house by the time this is pub-
lished, say "hello" to another 5-by-5 dorm
room with that same roommate you haven't
decided if you like or not.
In February 2006, Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil passed an ordinance stating that lease-
signing would be prohibited until one-third
of the current lease period has passed. The
ordinance also allows house showings to
prospective tenants after a quarter of the
lease period has passed.
However, this ordinance only affects Sep-
tember-to-September leases. To evade this
ordinance, many landlords changed their
leases to May-to-May. This loophole in the
language exempts many properties from the
ordinance's measures, which are clearly ben-
eficial to students.
Tearsdo not need to be shed over this prob-
lem - there are simple solutions. Ann Arbor
needs to set a standard date for all landlords
to begin signing on houses or apartments,
regardless of a September-to-September or
a May-to-May lease. That date needs to be
in the second semester. Freshmen should
not have to scramble to decide which people
they met within the past few blurry weeks
they actually could live with. Students con-

sidering study abroad for the following year
should not have to chose to live in a dorm in
September. You may have been best friends
with your roommate in the beginning of the
year and then find out your personalities
don't mesh just right. Unfortunately, you've
already signed a lease - tying yourself to that
person for at least the coming year.
The solution is simple: Give people more
time. We need it. College is a time of growth
and discovery - people change and that's ok
and expected. Please give us the beginning of
the year to worry about exams, papers, social
lives, money and the football season, instead
of housing. Winter semester is generally less
dramatic than the fall. Housing crises may
actually be entertaining at that point.
Setting a standard for when house and
apartment leases are allowed to be signed will
not stop students from knocking on doors in
October or recruiting people to live with early
on. It will, however, give students time to fig-
ure out their wants and needs, who they can
envision as a roommate and their best option
for the following year. This way, students can
be flexible early on and focus on more impor-
tant activities. Ann Arbor's economic vitality
is dependent on its 25,000 students. Allowing
students to sign a lease at a reasonable time
will not harm landlords - their properties
will still sell out. City Council should push the
ordinance's dates to the winter semester. It is
the simplest way to end the unnecessary and
untimely stress placed on students.

ydrofracking is one of
the most volatile forms of
fossil
fuel extraction
around. I say
this not as an
environmental-
ist, but as an
engineer. My
classmates can
vouch for me
when I say that JOE
engineering stu- SUGIYAMA
dents are drilled
in the art of
logical deduction. We understand
that opinions and actions can have
repercussions that can affect the
lives of millions. Without adequate
logical planning - and I'm not even
talking about something crazy sci-
entific, simply weighing the pros
and cons would suffice - any proj-
ect can turn disastrous. This was
clearly not the approach taken by
the New York based group, Clean
Growth Now, when they decided
that hydrofracking can be safe.
Just like that, huh? The self-
proclaimed "moderate voice" of the
hydrofracking debate - which has
conspicuously forgotten to include
any environmentalist experts on its
panel - appears to have turned a
blind eye to the laundry list of prob-
lems associated with the practice.
For those of you who may not be
familiar with hydraulic fracturing
known as hydrofracking - here's
the lowdown. It's a method used to
extract natural gas that channels
millions of gallons of highly pressur-
ized water - along with hundreds
of toxic chemicals and particulate
matter - to break through bedrock
and reach natural gas deposits deep
below the surface.
This method of extraction poses
a serious threat to the health of
people as well as the environment.
The water that is used to break
up the bedrock is ridden with
chemicals that contaminate the
groundwater in the vicinity of the
hydrofracking. The Environmental
Protection Agency has recently
been investigating this matter in
Pavillion, WY, where concerns
have grown over the levels of

contaminates in drinking water
caused by local hydrofracking.
The EPA has advised the resi-
dents of the city to not cook with or
drink the water. It has also advised
that showers should be taken only
with adequate ventilation to avoid
the inhalation of the chemicals.
Encana, the company respon-
sible for the hydrofracking in the
area, has taken necessary steps
- including providing alternative
water sources to the citizens - to
lessen the blow of probable law-
suits. Once further investigation is
done, the company will surely be
responsible for the ensuing reme-
diation processes.
Unfortunately, this is not a unique
situation throughout the country,
and it begs the question: How can
something so destructive be allowed
to occur in populated areas? The fis-
cal benefit of hydrofracking seems
to have put health concerns on the
back burner.
A Feb. 26 New York Times arti-
cle assures us that poisoning our
groundwater is not the only problem
associated with hydraulic fractur-
ing. The water used to break through
the ground can sometimes be taint-
ed by radioactive materials that
exist naturally below the surface.
The highly pressurized slurry of
water injected is pumped out of the
excavation and placed in a retention
pond for decontamination and then
shipped off to the nearest wastewa-
ter treatment plant.
However, negligent laws gov-
erning the on-site treatment have
allowed the radioactive levels of
the water to go largely untouched.
Wastewater plants don't have the
capacity to treat the high levels of
radioactive materials present in the
drilling water and have no choice
but to discharge the contaminated
water into local water supplies. In
Pennsylvania, the radioactive levels
detected were thousands of times
greater than federal standards.
Although treatment of this con-
taminated water occurs before the
water reaches our faucets, farming
and fishing don't have the benefit of
this secondary treatment, and peo-
ple are thus exposed to the radia-

tion by way of ingestion.
Many proponents of hydrofrack-
ing have argued that natural gas is *
a cleaner energy alternative to coal,
which is certainly true. There is
nothing clean about the burning of
coal, which is a major contributor to
globalwarmingand other air quality
issues. However, coal appears to be
the lesser of two evils. The benefits
for the atmosphere associated with
using natural gas simply don't out-
weigh the irrefutable damage done
to our water supply.
This method to
extract natural
gas is dangerous. *
So how do we stop such a terrible
innovation in energy technology?
With alternative energy sources.
Original, no? Though this point has
been belabored by environmental-
ists across the board, it should be
noted that even natural gas wells
will someday run dry. We need a
logical approach to this situation
and address it before we have an
energy Armageddon. If we divert
the money from hydrofracking to,
say, creating a more efficient solar
panel, the looming energy crisis for
our grandchildren could potentially
be averted, and millions of people
can stop thinking twice before run-
ning their faucets.
So next time you see one of
those ExxonMobil hydrofracking
commercials - laced with inspi-
rational music and scenic nature
shots - or hear the Clean Growth
Now group raving about the ben-
efits of hydrofracking and natural
gas, please admire their sheer igno-
rance toward human health. Yes,
hydrofracking is big business, but
with a little more time and funding,
renewable energy could be big busi-
ness as well.

Berenson says Michigan is
freelancing, getting'cute'

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 7 Michigan hockey
team can only dream of execut-
ing a trick shot like the game-
winner in Saturday night's
sudden-death shootout.
As Miami (Ohio) forward
Bryon Paulazzo skated to take
the shot, he paused at the crease
in front of Michigan fifth-year
senior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick.
He then proceeded to make
a 360-degree turn; lobbing the
puck over Hunwick's left shoul-
der.
That trick shot worked for the
RedHawks and iced the game in
the blink of an eye. But it may be
a long time before you see the
Wolverines pull a stunt like that.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
says he still can't even trust his
team get the puck from point A
to point B.
"If our players get too loose,
then they start doing things
that are not in the game plan,"
Berenson said.
"They start freelancing to a
point where it's not in sync with
the team."
Junior forward Chris Brown
was adamant that these prob-
lems shouldn't plague a highly

ranked program. But somehow,
Michigan still struggles.
That begs the question: what
exactly does "making simple
plays" mean?
More than anything, it means
keeping possession of the puck.
Too often, when the Wolverines
take command of the puck, they
quickly lose it. A pass gets inter-
cepted or sometimes a player
just loses control. In the worst of
these situations, the turnovers
result in goals for Michigan's
opponents.
It happened on Saturday
when freshman defenseman
Mike Chiasson's attempt to
clear Michigan's zone eventu-
ally resulted in a Miami game-
tying goal.
All season long, Berenson has
preached the importance of not
playing "cute." But for some rea-
son, the message isn't sinkingin.
This isn't a problem that can
be blamed on the team's young
blood. According to Brown, it
"happens all the time, to guys
that are 18 to 24."
Berenson says he always
makes his expectations explic-
itly clear. But when confidence
- instead of common sense -
takes over for Michigan, it's easy
for the simple things to get lost
in the madness of the game.

"There are players that think
they can make a move, and then
it doesn't work out and they
regret it," Berenson said.
"It's up to (the coaches) to
communicate what's expected.
We need everyone on the same
page."
The problem is becoming so
serious that Berenson is even
prepared to threaten the players
- too many fancy antics on the
ice will lead to "a lesser role on
the team."
The coaches are frustrated,
and the captains are too. The
seniors have been trying to
emphasize the importance of
staying in the right mindset
before games.
"It's not a light switch that
you can just turn on," Brown
said.
"You've got to make sure that
before you take a pregame nap
or pregame meal that you're
thinking about doing the little
things correct."
Until the Wolverines prove
that they can master the basics
of hockey, Berenson has no
plans to allow them to freestyle
on the ice.
"We've got a lot of work to
do," Berenson said. "We don't
have time for players improvis-
ing outside the team."

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Sophomore forward Jon Horford started the season opener last Friday against
Ferris State but came off the bench Monday night against Towson.

Beilein is very aware of the
free throw issue. He said Monday
night that his team can't contin-
ue to shoot 50 percent from the
line and win (that's just a luxury
of starting the season against
a Division-II opponent and an
opponent with no returning
starters).
But what can Beilein do?
He'll just have his players
shoot a few extra free throws in
practice. He's a Division I col-
lege basketball coach, not acamp
counselor teaching a three-day
seminar for Detroit youths on
proper form.
Beilein recruits shooters. And
over time - though sooner would
be better than later - they'll
shake off that early-season rust
and start knocking down free
throws. Remember, even Ray
Allen misses from the line some-
times.
But I would recommend that
the Wolverines try to penetrate
a bit more so his players could
get to the free throw line more
frequently. It's hard to do in his
shoot-happy offense, but we

could see more free throw oppor-
tunities if the bigs emerge from

When do you think Stu

-Erin Hutchinson
I'm not sure you watched the
same game I did on Monday.
Douglass was relegated to the
sixth-man role he owned through
most of last season, while fresh-
man stud Trey Burke took over at
the point, and it will likelybe that
way for the long haul.
It's easy, really. Burke is the
only true point guard on the
roster, and Douglass is a natural
shooter who thrives in the two-
guard position.
Beilein was actually ready to
make that move for the season
opener last week, before Burke
showed up late to the team walk-
through on the day of the game.
The coach benched him for dis-
ciplinary reasons, but both have
now dismissed the issue as a
rookie mistake that won't hap-
pen again.

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Courtney Boylan was the only
player in Crisler Arena yesterday
afternoon at 12:30 p.m. - well,
besides her rebounder.
It was before the Michigan
women's basketball team started
practice, and the senior guard -
the team's leading scorer - was
shooting 3-pointers and practic-
ing various post moves.
"This is a pretty typical day for
her," said Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth. "She's in here everyday.
I don't want to say seven days a
week, but she's working on her
gameyear round. She realizesshe's
not very big so she's got to take her
advantage where she can."
In last Friday's season-opener
against Florida, Boylan scored a
team-high 21 points, which was
also a career high. After her per-
formance, she received her first
Big Ten Player of the Week award,
making her the first Michigan
player to do so since graduated
Veronica Hicks did last season.
"(Winning the award) was a
nice honor," Boylan said. "I really
wasn't expecting it at all, but it
was a big win for the team so it
was exciting. I'm not looking into
it too much, just trying to help our
team win."
Last season, after junior Nya
Jordan suffered a knee injury,
Boylan was thrust into a starting
role. Since Hicks was the go-to
scorer for the Wolverines, Boylan

mostly ran the point, which lim-
ited her scoring production.
At home against Florida Atlan-
tic on Monday, Boylan's offensive
success continued. Though she
wasn't Michigan's leading scorer
- junior center Rachel Scheffer
took that honor with 20 points -
she was a close second with 18.
"I've seen her score on small
kids, big kids, fading away and
stepping through," Borseth said.
"She can do a lot of things with
that ball, but most importantly
she can handle it. And we need
her to be able to do that."
Boylan's 70-percent mark from
the field is 17 percent higher than
the team average, a large margin
for any player. Last season, she
shot a mere 32 percent from the
field and only averaged 6.8 points
per game, which was a career
high. But she was consistently
taking 3-pointers, contributing to
her low percentage.
Her high percentage this year
has partially been because she
hasn't attempted a three-pointer
in either game, instead mostly
scoring near the basket. At 5-foot-
7, she is the smallest player on the
Wolverines' roster. But, that has
not stopped her from also averag-
ing 4.5 rebounds per game - dou-
ble her career average.
"It's going to get a little bit
more demanding for her as people
figure out some of the things she's
good at," Borseth said. "She's like
abowlinachinashop around that
basket. She's tough."

ALBUM REVIEW
'Camp'not childish

FILM REVIEW
'Jack and Jill' falls hard

Donald Glover's
new LP struggles to
set itself apart
By GEOFF MARINO
DailyArts Writer
There's something inherently
disarming about Donald Glover.
Sure, his stand-up can get a bit
dirty, but the
fact that he has ***
written for "30
Rock" and stars MiMdish
in "Communi- Gambino
ty" produces a
charming aura Camp
that makes
itself known Glassnote
every time he
melts into his toothy, childish
smile.
Yet Glover's rapping persona
mocks this assumption. With his
first label-backed album, Camp,
he moves beyond the embodi-
ment of the "childish" part of
the moniker, suggesting it's just
part of a darker identity. Though
Glover claims the name "Child-
ish Gambino" came from a Wu-
Tang Clan name generator, it's
obvious he keeps it for a reason:
to lull listeners into a false sense
of security before he brashly
unleashes the darker parts of his
soul.
It's easy to grow bored with
the familiar trope that is a rap-
per's identity crisis - here is yet
another young person who grew
up alienated and disrespected,
and is looking to music to rise
above the oppression of society.
MUSIC NOTEBOOK

But Glover didn't grow up in the
streets. He left Atlanta and went
to art school, eventually gradu-
ating from NYU.
To view Childish Gambino
through the confines of such a
common theme is like making a
kaleidoscope with one color: It
neglects the inherent richness of
his story.
The deepest parts of the
album are painful reflections of
how his identity clashes with -
and cannot escape - the stereo-
types of his race. In "Outside,"
he confesses a complex rela-
tionship with his upbringing.
He never felt part of the 'hood
culture, "They talkin''hood shit
and I ain't know what that was
about." Glover felt his upbring-
ing did not lead to camarade-
rie with his peers - instead, he
experienced alienation.
His parents ultimately decid-
ed to move away, but Glover
maintains the struggles weren't
left behind: "Truth is we still
struggle on a different plane."
Though he is surely surround-
ed by a fulfilling life, Glover
still wrestles with his race. To
emphasize the tragedy of soci-
etal pressures on identity, he
laments his relationship with his
cousin, who seems to have been
an early hero now consumed by
the callousness of the streets.
Unfortunately, the quality of
Camp's rich lyrics are not con-
sistently paralleled by the music.
He raps about creating a brand
of "black rock," but for the most
part, there's nothing that dis-
tinguishes his beats from what
we've heard elsewhere. Some

songs come together in a spe-
cial way, but more often the jazz
influences and sweeping orches-
tral and choral productions have
been thrown in without a char-
acteristic touch.
Perhaps "Sunrise" achieves
Glover's lofty goal. It's a sum-
mery coalition of rock and hip
hop, with a web of voices weav-
ing around Glover's in the form
of a rallying cry. It's a new form
of pop. "That Power" builds on
it, with the beginning forming
out of a dark, choral style of pro-
duction invoking Kanye before
the track mellows out into a jazz
monologue.
Sadly, beyond "Sunrise" and
"That Power," Camp is disap-
pointing. Gambino is a new
entry to the constantly expand-
ing definition of "rapper," but his
music as a whole, with its gran-
diose plan of being a new "black
rock," doesn't feel as fresh. The
beats often seem recycled, and
listeners are left to puzzle at
how a creative genius like Don-
ald Glover doesn't offer any con-
sistent musical innovation.

The movie is about two twins,

How I fell in love, drifted and returned to the Decemberists

By ELLIOT ALPERN
DailyArts Writer
About four years ago, I alight-
ed upon the love of my life. We
had been introduced by a mutual
* friend, and though the two of us
were caught up in our own sepa-
rate lives, there was an air of inevi-
tability to our acquaintance.
Still, the timing was inconve-
nient. I turned my concentrations
to my schoolwork, and though I
often revisited that piece of har-
mony that was our introduction,
I found I just couldn't donate
enough time for the two of us to
coexist. I consented to hoping
one day we might find ourselves
together again, with nothing to
stand in our way.
During my freshman year of
college, the object of my infatu-
ation slowly but surely seeped
back into my life. Coupled with

turned out to be just as fruitful as

that bobbing for apples on the

be a futile effort. "E. Watson" and
"Burying Davy," both exquisitely

So when I then turned to the
recent iTunes music session - an
assembly of eight songs re-record-

once more. The Decemnberists had
placed into my hands a veritable
photo album of our time together.
Snapshots from The King Is Dead
(consisting of "June Hymn" and
"This Is Why We Fight," two
of my favorites) evoked warm
memories of summer: sipping iced
tea, poised on my front porch as
Meloy's harmonica diffused out-
ward into the balmy July night.
"Shankill Butchers," from The
Crane Wife, brought back those
days during freshman year when,
with our affair rekindled, the fat
snowflakes would drift leisurely
past my bedroom window.
Nothing, though, could pre-
pare me for the flood of nostal-

swept up in it, powerless against
the currents that pulled me to

of time had piled up, and eventu-
ally buried my fond recollection
of our beginnings together. And
as Meloy sang softly of "tawny
gypsy girls" and "bootblack fin-
gertips," I knew this breakup was
for the best. These songs, this
new material, it all helped me to
realize the special time we had
together, and the time we one day
might spend together again.

comedian remained remarkably
engaged in the conversation, fir-
ing responses that ranged from
insightful to did-he-really-just-
say-that?
Known. for his roles in films
like "Forgetting Sarah Mar-
shall," "Get Him to the Greek"
and "Arthur," Brand also has a
long history as a stand-up come-
dian. On his "Keepinglt Simple"
tour, he plans to shock, enter-
tain and perhaps invite audi-
ence members to join in on his
act at EMU Convocation Center
tonight. In an equal combina-
tion of sharp-tongued banter
and fervent viewpoints, Brand
gave a preview of his routine in
Ypsilanti. He was actually quite
specific as to'what to expect.
"It's going to be absolute
unbridled insanity," he told The
Michigan Daily. "No universities
are going tobe the same. We're
going to transform everyone's
mentality, everybody's outlook.
... It's going to be absolute devil-
ment, ribaldry and chaos. I imag-
ine that after this gig, the student
pregnancies will go through the
roof. There's gonna be a lot of
erotica and a lot of mating."
Hold on.Did Russell Brand just
say people are going to be having
sex during his comedy act?
"Sure, there's gonna be con-
ceptions happening all over the
stage," Brand claimed.

Russell Brand encourages heckling.
His lighthearted response
was not completely unexpected
(maybe the orgy part was a little
surprising). But while Brand
was joking (hopefully), he also
stressed the importance of rec-
ognizing when a certain situa-
tion calls for seriousness. Toting
a long history of addictions and
arrests, Brand was comfortable
discussing his past and how he is
able to morph it into a humorous
subject
"You think about your own
personal experience," he said.
"Drugs are aserioussubject... but
also very, very funny."
He added, "In certain situa-
tions people are ready for certain
kinds of information. The ability
as an artist, you have to recog-
nize the situation in context and
make sure that the narrative you
give people is the narrative that
they're ready to understand."
But rather than reiteratingthe
age-old idea of a fine line between
comedy and tragedy, Brand pro-
vided his own interpretation.
"There's a massive great big
tangent between comedy and
tragedy," he said.
His responses were emphatic
and charged with a sense of
authenticity not commonly seen
in modern celebrities. Brand
upholds this realness in his
own comedy routines. While he
admires comedians like Richard

0

Pryor and Bill Hicks, a key inspi-
ration for his jokes is his own
story.
"The embarrassing things in
my life, the peculiar things that
people around me say... canmake
you laugh a lot more than things
on the TV," he said. "So that's
what you look out for. Situations
where I'm embarrassed, and I try
to overcome that embarrassment
through comedy."
Sometimes Brand actually gets
comically inspired mid-routine.
What does he think of people
who interrupthis act?
"That's someone auditioning
for a part in your show," Brand
said. "I encourage people to
heckle and be ready for the con-
sequences."
A true comedian, Brand revels
in the opportunity to make light
of any situation. When asked
whether he prefers the volatility
of stand-up or scripted comedies
like "Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"
Brand seemed almost indignant
at the question.
"Stand-up! Scripted comedy ...
it's fuckingboring," he said.
While fans of his films would
probably disagree that there's
anything boring about them, it's
hard to argue with the opinion-
ated comedian. If you really want
to take it up with him, just pipe up
during his act in Ypsilanti - he'll
be happy to respond.

ALBUM REVIEW
Heroes are nearing zero
By EDITH FREYER

By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Daily Arts Writer
The CW's new witchy drama,
"The Secret Circle,"doesn't waste
any time before racking up its
body count. The
show kills off
the lead char-
acter's mother 'k Secret
in a cold open
reminiscent of Crcle
the first scene Midseason
of "The Vam-
pire Diaries" - Thursdays
chilling, quiet at 9 p.m.
and beautifully The CW
shot. It contin-
ues to take risks and while it's far
from perfect, the first nine epi-
sodes pack just enough character
development and exposition to
prove that this show is up to its
pointy black hat in potential.
"The Secret Circle" is set in the
fictional town of Chance Harbor,
which becomes Cassie Blake's
(Britt Robertson, "Life Unex-
pected") new home after her
mother is murdered. Having lost
her father many years ago, Cassie
moves in with her grandma (Ash-
ley Crow, "Heroes") and attempts
to start over at a new high school.
Five students, all of whom lost
parents around the same time,
approach Cassie and give her the
real news: She's a witch. They are
all witches and need her to com-
plete the circle with a binding
ceremony that will strengthen
their collective power.
Spoiler Alert: The writers take
a risk by killing off a member
of the circle just five episodes
into the first season. Nick (Louis
Hunter "Out of the Blue") wasn't
working as a character and won't
be missed, but for a brand new
show to step up with a bold move
like that is impressive and unex-
pected. Nick's death allows the
introduction of a more mysteri-
ous character: Jake (Chris Zylka,
"Kaboom"), Nick's older brother
who returns to Chance Harbor
after Nick's death. He is both a
witch and a witch hunter, a walk-

ing contradiction with some
serious identity problems. Jake
bounces between being a possible
hero and a threat to the circle. The
duality of Zylka's performance is
almost unsettling to watch, but
it's one of the show's strengths.
But "The Secret Circle" could
improve by developing Cassie.
She's often clueless and shows
little emotional range in com-
parison to Faye (Phoebe Tonkin,
"Home and Away"), a standout
player and one of the best new
female characters on television
this fall. She is the most unpre-
dictable and unstable member of
the circle, following cruel insults
with moments of sincerity.
Though Faye is all over the place,
Tonkin approaches the role with
a finesse and precision that make
it hard to believe she's so young
and inexperienced.
The love triangle that forms
between unofficial circle leader
Diana (Shelley Hennig, "Days of
Our Lives"), her longtime boy-
friend Adam (Thomas Dekker,
"Terminator: The Sarah Connor
Chronicles") and Cassie might
make the show look like a super-
natural teen soap at the surface
level, but in reality "The Secret
Circle" is dark in tone and story.
Someone is always out to get the
circle, and when the witches final-
ly attempt to have some normal
fun at a Halloween party, they're
kidnapped by witch hunters.

"The Secret Circle" has a
strong start, but there is vast
room for improvement. Upping
the horror will definitely help.
"Slither" is the best episode so
far - frightening and shocking, it
allows the cast to show its range.
The midseason finale established
that Cassie comes from an evil
lineage, which opens up plenty
of opportunities for dark drama
that will hopefully allow Robert-
son to prove she has more than
just one facial expression.
Something good
this way comes.
Before tackling a complicated
character arc, the writers need
to focus on making the show's
mythology and timeline air-
tight. It's odd that the genera-
tion above the the current circle
all had children around the same
time and at very young ages. Cir-
cle magic is confusing, and it's
unclear just how many other cir-
cles exist. Most of the questions
that arise stem from careless
writing and not mystery. These
gaps need to be fixed and the
less-developed characters need
to grow before this show can
make the transition from enjoy-
able to noteworthy.

Remember Gym Class Heroes?
They're the band that hit it big
on the hip hop-
rock fusion
scene around
2006 with
songs like
"New Friend H&e ,
Request" (that's ThePapercut
2006 for you, hronicles l
huh?). Fans of
the group have Decaydanse/
been in the dark Fueled by Ramen
since 2Q08,
when they released The Quilt.
Fast forward three years and
one solo-career (the group's rap-
per, Travie McCoy), and Gym
Class Heroes are back with their
fifth studio album, The Paper-
cut Chronicles IL The record is
a sequel to 2005's The Papercut
Chronicles, and by the looks of it
the band would have been better
off starting from scratch.
The cornerstone of this
album is the less-than-stellar
single "Stereo Hearts," featuring
Maroon 5's Adam Levine. It's no
more than a dime-a-dozen pop
song, and even worse because it
resounds with the vocalist's hor-
ribly nasal falsetto. Need more
proof? The song equates Leyine's
heart to a stereo and includes
these headache-inducing lyrics:
"I only pray you'll never leave me
behind / Because good music can
be so hard to find." Commence
eye rolling.'
"Life Goes On," a collabora-
tion with Denmark's red-hot
pop star Oh Land, is the record's
greatest triumph (but that's not
saying much). Her breezy, clear
tones appear oddly sentimen-
tal against the gritty rapping,
and it works. This song is the
most unique (and repeatedly
listenable) of the bunch, though

PERSONALSTATEMENT

MORE THAN EXPERIENCE
REFLECTING ON A SUMMER OF
.MOUSE EARS AND MOTORS
BY COURTNEY MURPHY

After completing fall semes-
ter of my junior year,
decided to change things up
a bit. I was lucky enough to get a job
offer, and instead of registering for
classes to complete another semes-
ter in Ann Arbor, I decided to take
the semester off to gain some work
experience.
I was offered an internship
position in Walt Disney World's
Industrial Engineering depart-
ment in Orlando, Fla. Disney, I
learned, has its own set of terms it
uses to describe the layout of the
park. They use "on stage" and "off
stage" to classify different areas on
Disney property. "On stage" was
anywhere an employee could be
seen by guests, and "back stage"
included areas where guests are
not allowed. As an Industrial Engi-
neering intern, I was usually "back-
stage," while working in a building
at Disney's Hollywood Studios. It
was right behind the Rockin' Roll-
ercoaster attraction. I worked on
projects at all four parks as well as
some of the Disney resorts. During
lunch breaks, the other interns and
I would usually go on a ride or two

is where I developed

udent housing for the
o quickly became my

close friends.
I worked as a global purchas-
ing and supply chain intern in
the Outbound Vehicle Logistics
group. My responsibility was to
communicate with different car-
riers, present sourcing recom-
mendations and reward business
to the best fitting carrier for vari-
ous vehicle distribution centers
across the United States. I was
also in GM's Ambassador Pro-
gram, which allowed me to test
vehicles. I had a yellow Camaro
SS (Bumblebee from "Transform-
ers") in June, and orange Corvette
Grand Sport in
than August. Between
my friends and
s on a I drove at least
one fun car each
week, and we took
full advantage of
the opportunity.
When I first began my search
for an internship, and when I
eventually got a job offer in my
junior year, I honestly had no idea
what to expect and didn't know
where I would end up or what the
internship was good for in the long
run. However, looking back on
this past year and the experience I
obtained through my internships,
I realize how much I learned
about myself in the process.
Not only did I get a better
understanding of myself through
these internships, I found out
what I wanted out of a career and
formed some great friendships

with the other interns.
I've always been the kind of
person who likes to experience
and learn new things. I want
to continue to learn and move
around as much as possible.
Interning in the Midwest and then
driving to the South allowed me to
do exactly that. From developing
strategies, to making a parkgoers'
experience better, to test driving
brand new sport cars, I learned
what I needed to focus on while
building my career.
Going into my full-time job
search, the past year has steered
the type of positions I have looked
for. My main focus has been look-
ing for positions in consulting
firms because I feel it's similar to
the internship experience: travel-
ing to different locations, learn-
ing about different companies and
working with different people as
the projects evolve and grow.
Typically, I have always viewed
the word "internship" as a sum-
mer job that would look good on
a resume, but I found out that the
relationships, experiences and
self-development that come out
of an internship are real rewards
that I will live with forever. An
internship can be more than just a
couple of bullet points on a resu-
me - it's a guiding experience that
gave me confidence I can survive
in the rat race.

JOBS
From Page 5B
because of the University's pres-
tige and the employment aid
alumni provide.
"I think (finding a job) is get-
ting better as the economy gets a
little better," Zikakis said. "But
I think at other schools that cer-
tainly remains an issue that there
are not enough jobs available for
all the undergrads that are finish-
ing up. I think we just happen to
be in a really good situation here
at Michigan."
The University has more than
500,000 living alumni - making
it one of the largest living alum-
ni bases in the country. Luckily
for University students, Sebille-

White said many University
alumni look to hire fellow Wol-
verines when possible.
"U of M has such an extensive
alumni network and alumni who
are just so passionate about }the
institution and giving back to the
institution and helping current
students and recruiting current
students," Sebille-White said.
"I've seen it make a difference."
Along with a strong supportive
alumni base, even just the words
"the University of Michigan"
helps students when applying.
The number of University
graduates at a company is used
as a statistic of pride for many
employers - similar to the num-
ber of University of California-
Berkeley and Harvard University
graduates, Sebille-White added.

"U of M is always on that tar-
get list," Sebille-White said.
"(Employers) may not always be
able to hire, (and) they may not
always be able to hire in the same
numbers, but U of M is probably
going to be one of the last institu-
tions that they drop off their list."
Steele Paddon said she feels
like the University name will
help her, even if it's just ensuring
recruiters will read her resume.
"I think people might look at
my resume a little bit faster, being
like 'oh, University of Michigan.
It's a super prestigious name, they
produce great students, they have
a very rigorous academic pro-
gram,"' she said. "But at the same
time, if I don't have any experi-
ence to back that up, it doesn't
really mean a lot."

random student interview by kaitlin williams

Welcome to the random
student interview,
where the official lan-
guage is English.
So Molly, what are you study-
ing?
I'm undecided right now. I've got
to figure that out.
No kidding. You're a freshman.
Get on that. So what are you
taking right now?
I'm taking Great Books. I'm taking
Spanish 277, a psychology in lin-
guistics class and a science semi-
nar on oceans.
OK. So you're obviously slack-
ing.
(Laughs)
tHablas Espafiol?
Si, un poco.
Yo tambien. Fantastico. And
we're done with that. This is
America. I would continue, but
I don't think that whatever
readership I have would appre-
ciate having to go to Google
translate.
Yeah.
Do you learn dolphin as a part of
your ocean class?
That would be incredible, but
sadly I'm not.
They might add it to the curric-
ulum you know. They get those
weird mini-courses going. I

wouldn't doubt it if Intro to
Dolphin popped up.
Yeah.
So have you already backpacked
all of your classes for next
semester?
I'm actually going to talk to my
adviser in a couple minutes. I
haven't backpacked yet.
Oh OK. You're still young and
think they can actually help
you. How proactive. Have you
gone to advising before?
Umm, during orientation.
Were they really any help?
Yeah, actually. Considering the
amount of classes there are at the
University, in order to help, having
someone who can point you in the
right direction in terms of what
classes to take is very helpful.
Yeah. Is undergraduate advis-
ing paying you to say this?
No. I mean, even if I routed
through the course guide there's
no way I could know completely
what classes are going to be appro-
priate for me.
Yeah. So, you must be Honors
since you're in Great Books. How
great are those great books?
Umm, they're very difficult. I
mean, who am I to say what books
are the best or contribute the most
to society or anything like that?

You're an Honors student! I
did Honors in my day. Ivaguely
remember reading an awful lot
of Greek stuff.
Yeah for sure.
So, you're undecided. What
would be the thing you're most
interested in going into? You
know, if money and job security
weren't a persistent and fright-
ening worry.
Yeah, unfortunately that wor-
ries everyone. But currently, I'm
actually thinking about going into
speech pathology.
OK, cool.
Although I'm not so sure. There's
still so much I have to learn about
how to get into careers and dif-
ferent things. Right now what I'm
trying to do is try to think about
what kind of career I want to have
and what kind of degree might get
me there. And at the same time, it
has to be a degree that I'd be inter-
ested in studying, in a subject that
I would want to know.
OK wow. Still so young. Call me
when you give up and decide to
become an English major like
me. I would say you're focusing
right in on something wonder-
ful there. I was pre-med once
and full of optimism. Those
were the days...

(Silence)
So, why the Spanish language
class? You obviously tested out
of the requirement.
Yeah I tested out of the require-
ment. It's just a personal thing. I'm
a very talkative, outgoing person,
and I'd like to be able to talk with
more people, and if I can talk in
Spanish as well as English it great-
ly expands my ability to do that.
Yeah I can tell. You stopped
for the interview. Most people
breeze on by. Or they give me
one-word answers, which allows
me to ramble on asa representa-
tive of The Michigan Daily.
My brother actually wrote for the
Daily a couple of years ago.
Oh, what section did he write
for?
Sports.
News is better.
He wrote about football his senior
year.
Oh in that case, everyone wants
to write about football.
Yeah he had a great thing going.
So, I'll let you get to your advis-
ing appointment. Wouldn't
want to hold you back, such
a gung-ho freshman. Adios
amigo.

Wednesday, November 16, 2011 // The Statement B

answer questions about what they're
F rom the first day of preschool, tots
going to do when they "grow up." As
first graders, students aspire to have
jobs like a zoo keeper, circus performer,
astronaut or the president. But as the years
go on, the career ideas grow and become
more realistic - more individualized.
During the four-year college experience,
students refine their skills and interests so
that after they walk across the podium and
throw their mortar board, they know how
they are going to define their success. But
with a dismal financial outlook, students
don't always think about what they want to
do when they "grow up" as they did when
they were in first grade - instead it's what
they have to do to get by.
With an economy that is not exactly
booming, the idea of securing a job imme-
diately post-graduation is not what all
students opt for. Instead, graduate school
furthers knowledge and postpones loan
payments until there is a concrete income
to pay the bills. In about five months, the
roughly 6,000 seniors will make the deci-
sion of what's next for them. They won't dis-
cuss what they're planning to do when they
"grow up" - because they already have.
FINDING HER WAY
LSA senior Layne Steele Paddon isn't
worried about the days after graduation
on April 28. Not only does she have a plan,
but she thinks the majority of her peers feel
they have a plan as well.
"I think it's not only societally forced on
us that once yougraduate you need a job, but
being in this kind of environment where it's
so rigorous and everyone's at the top of their
game, that we're all really competitive (to
get a job)," she said.
There isn't a twinge of fear as Steele Pad-
don talks about her future. She speaks with
confidence as she explains that through her
internships and firsthand experience she's
decided she wants to go into a career in digi-
tal advertising and marketing. She plans to
use her degree in communication studies
and work in Chicago or Detroit.
However, Steele Paddon can't currently
get a job because the advertising field moves
so quickly that jobs become available and
need to be filled within two weeks. Though
there isn't a job waiting for her, Steele Pad-
don says she's not scared she won't get one.
"Through the amount of networkingcthat
I've done and connections that I've made ...
I've established myself well enough where
HR recruiters have said to me, 'I'm going to
help you get a job, even if it's not at my com-
pany,'" she said.
LSA senior Cassie Mills accepted a full-
time job offer with Target Corporation after
her internship with the company last sum-
mer. At Target, she worked as a business
analyst in merchandising operations for
Target India and knew that 80 percent of
the interns would be offered full-time posi-
tions after completing the 10-week intern-
ship.
Target is currently holding her position

as an associate business partner for organi-
zational effectiveness until June when she
will start working.
"It feels good because I didn't know I
wanted (the position at Target)," Mills said.
"But at least having that, I came in this year
just so much more relaxed."
Mills is graduating in December with a
degree in organizational studies and plans
to take a semester off "to enjoy life" before
she starts her job.
"I think (the time off is) something that
everyone needs," Mills said. "Everyone
advises you not to go into the work force
right away because college is so demanding,
and then you need that time off. It's the one
time in your life when you'll get vacation."

business and

a lot easier for them to find a job," Zikakis
said, "because it's easier for a hiring com-
pany to just sort of slot them in."
Last year's Business School class had 87
percent of its 334 graduates employed with-
in three months after graduation, according
to Zikakis.
Steele Paddon said of all concentrations
and programs for undergraduate students
to pursue, business is the best choice for job
security.
Yet while explaining her non-business
career path post-graduation, Steele Pad-
don glowed with excitement, somethingshe
said is important for her peers to feel about
their careers too. Steele Paddon is going
into advertising because she enjoys it, not
because of the money.
"I'm actually really excited because I feel
like my job, still right now, is my hobby," she
said. "It's not anything I specifically study
so when I get to do it I'm still kind of giddy.
I just love it."
Steele Paddon pointed out that some of
her peers get stuck because they think their
first job defines all subsequentjobs. She said
she's comfortable with the idea that she can
change her mind and that she might not do
what she starts off doing for the rest of her
life.

that makes me happy, or if it's going poorly
or I'm just not achievingthe kind of success
that I want."
THE LOST GENERATION?
The slow economy is leaving highly edu-
cated students without the jobs they desire,
and instead, they are working to make ends
meet through multiple jobs that don't nec-
essarily require a degree. Recent articles
in publications like The New York Times
and The Atlantic have described the cur-
rent generation of
20-somethings as
"stuck in limbo"
' r V seen and "the lost gen-
eration."
- Generation X
.,increase was the subject of
a study published
ber of last month by
Jon Miller, a Uni-
w h o versity research
scientist at the
ba ck to Center for Politi-
cal Studies. Miller
found that mem-
re r u it. bers of "the lost
generation" do
lle-W hite not embody their
common stereo-
types of being
misunderstood
ior and underachiev-
ing.
Miller wrote
in the report that
the three words
that describe Generation X are: "active, bal-
anced and happy." The study found that the
most educated GenX'ers were more likelyto
be employed and worked the longest work
weeks. It also found that two-thirds of
GenX'ers were satisfied with their current
job - debunking the idea that finding a job
post-graduation is impossible.
Lynne Sebille-White, senior assistant
director at the University's Career Center,
said she doesn't think the students she sees
in her office are complacent about the job
search.
"It seems like students are more engaged
now," Sebille-White said. "Certainly, atten-
dance is back up to normal levels at things,
and campus recruiting is busy and resume
drops are back up."
A growing number of companies are
interested in recruiting University students,
according to Sebille-White. The Fall Career
Expo this year had to add an entire day
because more recruiters were interested in
coming to campus.
"Things are improving greatly," Sebille-
White said. "Certainly, we've seen a huge
increase in the number of employers who
are coming back to campus to recruit either
through the career fairs or campus recruit-
ing."

Beside hosting career fairs, the Career
Center works with students to develop resu-
mes, cover letters and a general career plan.
Mills found her internship with Tar-
get through the Career Center, which has
postings for positions available at various
corporations. She said she sees a disparity
between positions made for Business and
Engineering students and those posted for
LSA students.
"I feel bad because I know a lot of my
friends in LSA don't have a lot of the
resources and it's discouraging," Mills said.
"I think that the school does need to do a
better job of that. I think the Career Center
is OK, and they do try to do their best, but
they need to be making sure that LSA stu-
dents are getting as much of an advantage as
Engineering and Business students because
employers should be comingthere too."
Another option students have after grad-
uation is to take a "gap year" Sebille-White
added. Some students choose to get involved
in the Peace Corp or Teach for America
because they want time to learn more and
make more informed decisions regarding
their career, Sebille-White said.
"It's not necessarily the fallback that
they want to do Teach for America (or that)
they want to do Peace Corp," Sebille-White
said. "Maybe they've been really involved in
working on social justice issues or interna-
tional kinds of development issues or (want'
to understand) the different dynamic of the
educational system in the U.S. ... they feel
like now is a good time for me to be able to
do that."
Sebille-White added that the dynamic
between parents and students has changed
over time, and students are more willing to
seek their parents' advice which slows their
decision-making process.
"Younger folks in general have more
access to information than previous genera-
tions," Sebille-White said. "So they're going
to check those points of access, whether
that's their parents, their friends, other rel-
atives ... before they make decisions."
Steele Paddon said she's not worried
about life after graduation because she
always has her parents' support and can live
at their house if necessary.
"I'm going through the motions, I'm
doing the most that I can, so if I don't have
a job coming out of graduation, they're not
going to be upset with me, which is com-
forting," Steele Paddon said. "I don't feel
like I have tons of pressure because I have a
good support system."
THE MICHIGAN
DIFFERENCE
Try yelling "go blue!" in an airport and
not getting a response back. The phrase can
unify strangers and be common ground for
recruiters and students.
Sebille-White and Zikakis said attend-
ing the University is an advantage to stu-
dents. Zikakis suggested that students may
be more immune to the economic slump:, ,
