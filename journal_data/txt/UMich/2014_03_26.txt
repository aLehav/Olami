D ivest resolution r

CSG proposal
voted down after
extended public
comment period
By WILL GREENBERG and
KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily News Editor and
Daily Staff Reporter
After hours of discussion
and debate, the Central Stu-
dent Government reversed the
indefinite postponement of the
controversial divestment reso-
lution and subsequently voted
to not pass it in a 25-9 vote with

five abstentions early Wednes-
day morning.
Hundreds of students lined
the second floor of the Michigan
Union and entered the Rogel
Ballroom on a first-come, first-
served basis Tuesday evening,
and more than 2,000 viewers
watched CSG's live-stream of
the six-hour-long event. Uni-
versity Police regulated the
large crowd that formed both
inside and outside the Union
and organized the crowds to
line up on State Street. Students
allowed into the meeting were
given tickets and encouraged
not to leave the room once they
entered. When the meeting
began, the number of people in

the room exceeded its 375-per-
son capacity. An additional 200
students were seated in the
nearby Pendleton Room as an
overflow space.
On March 18, many mem-
bers of SAFE and its support-
ers attended the CSG Student
Assembly meeting to advocate
for a proposal to encourage
the University to divest from
certain companies allegedly
involved in human rights viola-
tions against Palestinians. After
the CSG assembly chose to post-
pone the vote indefinitely, SAFE
and its partners staged an indef-
inite sit-in in the CSG chambers
and formed "calls for account-
ability," asking CSG to make

amends for what SAFE viewed
as its poor handling of the situ-
ation and to bring the proposal
to a full vote.
The sit-in garnered atten-
tion across campus leading up
to Tuesday night's meeting.
This week, individuals both
supporting and opposing the
divestment resolution attended
in significant numbers. SAFE
representatives and members
of the 36 student organiza-
tions that have pledged support
for the resolution spoke to the
assembly about the proposal.
Students who spoke against the
resolution did not identify with
specific organizations, but were

With revised election
codes, candidates to
face strict guidelines
for two-day event
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
With recent rule changes to an
already strict election code, Cen-
tral Student Government presiden-
tial candidates will need to remain
cautious during the next two days
after the CSG election polls opened
at midnight Wednesday.
Changes to Article VI of the
CSG compiled code have increased
the severity of consequences for
all levels of infractions. Demerits
are assigned at the authority of the
University Election Commission
to individual candidates or parties
based on violations of the code.
In the past, demerits did not
affect a candidate until five demer-
its were accumulated, at which
point that candidate would be
removed from the election. If a
party received 10 demerits, the
entire party would be disqualified.

Under the new code, each demerit
results in a 3-percent deduction of
total weighted votes in the elec-
tion.
The UEC now also has the
power to issue an official warning
instead of a demerit. The warning
does not carry any penalty like a
demerit does.
One of the minor infractions
that a warning has been used for
was the absence of several candi-
dates at the mandatory candidates'
meeting that took place Feb. 27. A
violation at this level usually calls
for one to two demerits to be issued
to the individual candidate.
Prior to the hearing, Law stu-
dent Bryson Nitta, election direc-
tor, said the precedent of issuing
a warning for this offense was a
likely possibility.
"The way that we're approach-
ing this is with an awareness that
there can be big consequences
down the road that might not be
commensurate with the prob-
lem that arises when a candidate
doesn't come to the meeting," he
said.

hearing regarding these infrac-

MRacing celebrates
latest innovations
at Crisler Center
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
An army ofstudents wearing
khakis, brown shoes and blue
button-downs embroidered in
maize with "MRacing" on the
front, stood smiling around
their preliminarily finished
product Tuesday evening: a
Formula SAE race car.
The unveiling of the team's
MR-14 car came in the Col-
lege of Engineering-sponsored
program's 28th year and after
nearly 10 months of work
designing and manufacturing
this year's vehicle.
The event, held in the Junge
Family Champions Center at
Crisler Center, celebrated the
completion of this process. In
the presentation, College of
Engineering Dean David Mun-
son spoke about the location's

significance.
"Right here, adjacent to
Michigan Stadium ... it is a
perfect setting to recall the
oft-repeated phrase from our
legendary football coach, Bo
Schembechler: 'The team,
the team, the team,"' he said.
"MRacing is successful year
after year because talented and
generous individuals dedicate
themselves to the team."
Munson spoke of the state-
of-the-art engineering facili-
ties that allowed students to
create a Formula SAE car. He
complimented the "creative
community" of "bright minds"
and innovative problem-
solvers" spanning from all
disciplines of campus that con-
tributed to the project.
Engineering senior Joe
Martin, MRacing team cap-
tain, said the main issue this
year's team faced in building
its car was to improve its aero-
dynamics package.
This package, he said, has

Yale develops Shanghai school

Yale University announced
an official collaboration with
Shanghai Jiao Tong University,
a leading research institution,
The Yale Daily News reported
Monday.
Yale President Peter Salovey
and SJTU President Zhang Jie
signed the agreement last week
in Shanghai.
The new research center,
which will be located in
Shanghai, will specialize in
biostatistics.
"An ultimate goal is to identify
and facilitate research collabo-
rations not just with biostatisti-
cians at Yale, but colleagues at
Yale School of Medicine inter-
ested in clinical issues that

are a priority at SJTU, such as
lung cancer and diabetes," Paul
Cleary, the dean of Yale's School
of Public Health, said Monday.
So far, more than six
professors have planned to
relocate to conduct research at
the facility and collaborate with
SJTU faculty and students.
Cleary and Zhi-Jie Zheng,
the SJTU dean of public health,
began discussing plans for the
collaborative research institution
in 2012.
James Franco films scene on
Princeton Campus
Actor James Franco appeared
on Princeton University's campus

as filming commenced for "The
Sound and the Fury," The Daily
Princetonian reported Monday.
Washington Road, a
thoroughfare close to campus,
was shut down for filming.
Franco will act in and direct
the movie - a period drama set
in the early 20th century and
based on William Faulkner's
novel of the same name.
Kurt Enger, the film's
production supervisor, said
the campus location was ideal
because it so closely resembled
the setting of the film -
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Student-driven book series
to inspire entrepreneurship

Children's literature
aims to present
achievable goals
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
While the University has
launched a host of initiatives
designed to encourage student
innovators, a new children's
book series titled "Visionary
Kids" is aiming to spread the
entrepreneurial bug beyond
campus and to a younger
cohort.
Four months ago, two Uni-
versity students interested in
entrepreneurship and educa-
tion began writing their first
book in a series designed to
present the stories of famous

entrepreneurs in a kid-friendly
format. After its completion,
the two are now looking to pub-
lish more in their series.
Both of the authors pulled
from their studies to conceive
the idea for the book project.
LSA senior Sara Abraham is
planning to pursue a degree
in education and Reda Jaber
is pursuing an M.D., MBA and
MSCR combined degree, with
a focus in entrepreneurship at
the Ross School of Business.
The two teamed up with
illustrator Joaquin Arias to
complete the visual aspects of
the story.
"The Ross B-school heavily
influenced Reda in terms of
entrepreneurship, and with
regards to myself, I am pursuing
education and was really drawn
to the educational aspect of the

book," Abraham said. "With
that combined, I would say the
University of Michigan really
catalyzed this whole project in
regards to support and ideas."
Though small children are
often inventive and curious,
Abraham and Jaber said
children are rarely exposed
to the real-life success stories
that could instill the drive to
pursue creative ideas from a
young age. Jaber mentioned
that after strolling through
the children's book section
in several book stores, he and
Abraham were disappointed in
the way modern-day children's
stories are framed.
"A lot of them are fantasy,
fairytales; none of them were
real-life success stories,"
Jaber said. "Especially with
the growing emphasis on
entrepreneurship around
not just the University of
Michigan, but throughout
the country, we wanted to
get kids more interested
in entrepreneurship from
the get-go when they're
younger."
Jabersaidwiththecurrent
pressure on young people to
pursue degrees in STEM
fields such as medicine and
engineering, parents and
educational materials don't
place enough emphasis on
entrepreneurship.
"Before this program,
I really wasn't exposed
to entrepreneurship very
much," Jaber added. "But
entrepreneurship was this
really fun topic - it brings
out the kid in you."
The first book in the
series tells the story of Apple

co-founder Steve Jobs. The
book tackles the struggles he
faced, such as growing up as an
adopted child and later drop-
ping out of school. Though the
stories address delicate topics,
the authors portrayed each as
a struggle eventually overcome
with perseverance.
"The main theme stretch-
ing through all of them is that
they're working really hard,"
Abraham said.
Funded through an online
Kickstarter campaign running
through March 27, the pair's
$2,500 fundraising goal has
already been surpassed by
more than $300. The authors
included their backers in the
creative process by asking for
suggestions as to who the next
"visionary kid" should be.
For the next book, Jaber
and Abraham said they would
like to focus on local entrepre-
neurs, such as Dan Gilbert, the
founder of Rock Ventures and
Quicken Loans, who has most
recently spearheaded efforts to
redevelop Detroit's downtown.
The authors said they expect
the first book to be published
by June through CreateSpace, a
self-publishing company affili-
ated with Amazon. In its early
stages, the book will be sold
exclusively online, but the team
hopes to spread their work to
local Ann Arbor bookstores
and eventually larger national
chains.
E-books will be sold on Ama-
zon.com for $10 and paperbacks
for $12. Additionally, Vision-
ary Kids' official website will
accept preorders in the coming
weeks.

tions were a mix of warnings and
demerits. According to the depo-
sitions, candidates who were able
to present evidence of "extenuat-
ing circumstances" were issued a
warning, while those whom the
UEC ruled did not sufficiently
justify their absence were issued
one demerit each. In total, 24
candidates were issued demerits
and 10 were issued warnings.
Another example of a minor
infraction is the posting of cam-
paign materials in prohibited
areas. The only places where
campaign materials may be
posted in University buildings
are in designated spaces within
those University buildings and
residence halls. One of the pro-
hibited areas includes the CSG
chambers themselves. No infrac-
tions on prohibited posting have
been issued thus far.
Major infractions earn three
to four demerits and include
offenses such as influencing stu-
dents while voting and violat-
ing rules governing campaign
finances. Egregious infrac-
tions call for a minimum of four
demerits with at least 12 per-
cent of votes deducted These
violations include voting fraud,
bribing voters and preventing
students from voting.
Campaign spending is also
limited, according to the code.
Individual legislative candi-
dates may only contribute up to
$50 toward his or her campaign.
Presidential tickets may only
spend up to $1,000. Addition-
ally, parties are only allowed to
spend up to $1,000 per presiden-
tial ticket and $50 per individual
legislative candidate.
Individual voters are permit-
ted to donate up to $25 per leg-
islative candidate and $100 per
presidential ticket, with no more
than a combined total donation
of $150. Any donations accepted
from sources other than individ-

ual candidates, parties or eligible
voters are prohibited.
The revised code also increas-
es the authority of the UEC with
regard to the official campaign
period. Under the previous code,
there was no restriction to cam-
paigning before the official start
of the campaign period at the
conclusion of the mandatory
candidates' meeting. Now any
possible violations duringunoffi-
cial campaigning can be ruled on
by UEC in a hearing to take place
during the official period.
Nitta said the change was
made as a precaution for a theo-
retical violation and no such
problems regarding unofficial
campaigninghave occurred.
He added that he is working
to increase communication with
executive candidates and party
chairs in order to prevent pos-
sible infractions.
"I think opening wider com-
munication and informal conver-
sation will be a way to stave off,
hopefully, from litigation that
might be controversial," Nitta
said.
Nitta said he has received
multiple e-mails from candidates
regarding specific rules of cam-
paigning outlined in the code.
"It's really positive," he said.
"It shows that people are trying
to stay within the confines of the
rules, and I think that's great."
However, other student gov-
ernment bodies have recently
faced election controversies.
The Central Student Judiciary
recently invalidated the Decem-
ber 2013 elections for the Uni-
versity of Michigan Engineering
Council, ordering that those
elected executive officers be
removed from their positions.
Candidates from two of the
parties running in the March
26-27 CSG elections, Make
Michigan and FORUM, said they
are avoiding such controversies.
Both campaigns emphasize a
shift away from political agen-
das.

encouraged by several members
of Hillel to attend.
CSG President Michael
Proppe, a Business senior,
motioned to allow a reconsid-
eration of the indefinite post-
ponement of the divestment bill
once the assembly reached the
Motions and Other Business por-
tion of the meeting. This motion
passed with five dissenting
votes, followed by a revote on the
motion to indefinitely postpone
the bill again, which failed with
only seven in support. Proppe's
motion to reconsider Resolu-
tion 3-050 then passed with only
three dissenting votes.
Despite an amendment to line
105 of the resolution, adding the
phrase "pending the results of
the ad hoc committee," the pro-
posal did not pass. It was voted
on ins' secret ballot, an atamend-
ment to the rules decided by the
assembly to ensure the safety of
individual representatives.
LSA senior Suha Najjar, one of
the original authors of the reso-
lution, said while it wasn't the
complete outcome that members
of SAFE wanted, she was happy
their voices were not silenced
this time.
"I am upset. I am disappoint-
ed. But more so, I am very proud
of what we've accomplished,"
she said. "Last week there was a
decision to indefinitely postpone
and resolutions likethat don'tget
called back in here, but because
of our persistence and because of
our determination we came back
and we fought and we got to say
what we wanted to say."
She added that the sit-in is
now over and SAFE members
will not no longer occupy the
CSGchambers.
After the vote, supporters of
the resolution left the chambers
in silence to rally at the Cube in
front of the Fleming Adminis-
tration Building. Speakers at the
Cube shared their plans to take
a divestment proposal to the
University's Board of Regents,
thanked the resolution's sup-
porters at large - particularly
the large number of non-Pales-
tinian supporters - and advised
all members to remain cautious
on their way home given the per-
ceived hostility on campus after
last week's vote.
During the Community Con-
cerns portion of the meeting,
selected membersofthe audience
are given a three-minute time
allotment during which they are

allowed to make statements to
the assembly. During the bill's
second reading, authors of the
resolution continued the discus-
sion. Guest speakers opened the
meeting, followed by 90 minutes
of Community Concerns. Usual-
ly, only 30 minutes are allocated
for Community Concerns, but
the CSG assembly voted twice to
extend this time limit.
Max Blumenthal, a Jewish-
American author and journalist,
served as guest speaker on behalf
of SAFE. He was the first speaker
of the meeting and opened by
praising students of SAFE who
have been protesting for the past
week. SAFE members responded
with sign language applause,
since audible cheers were banned
by assembly rules.
Guests on behalf of Hil-
lel discussed alleged flaws in
the divestment resolution. Four
speakers on behalf of Hillel were
present, including Yael Aronoff,
associate professor of interna-
tional relations at Michigan State
University, and four University of
Michigan law students.
Law student Scott Bloomberg
said the resolution indicates
there will eventually be a broad
and consistent consensus on
divestment. He said due to the
diversity of views regarding this
issue, no such consensus will
ever be reached.
History Prof. Victor Lieber-
man, who recently received the
Golden Apple Award for teaching
and currently teaches the course
"The History of the Arab-Israeli
Conflict," delivered a presenta-
tion on the history of the conflict.
LSA senior Bayan Founas, a
SAFE member, said the group
was not consulted by CSG about
which professor would be pre-
senting to the assembly. She
added that several students vis-
ited with Lieberman and asked
him not to speak because they
disagree with his interpretation
of the history of the West Bank
conflict. Founas said SAFE mem-
bers requested that Proppe find
a different speaker a few hours
before the meeting, but were
informed it was too late.
In response to a question from
LSA sophomore Jacob Ruby, an
LSA representative, Lieberman
said he believes the passage of the
divestment resolution would fur-
ther the broader Boycott, Divest-
ment and Sanctions campaign
against Israel.
Speakers heard in random
order during Community Con-
cerns included students both
for and against the resolution at
hand. Several students in support

in the DIA yard," Orr noted. "If
you don't think that can hap-
pen, there are many sovereign,
wealthy, Russian oligarchs, Bra-
zilian millionaires who are call-
ing and inquiring."
Marieke Van Damme, LSA
museum project manager, who
attended the talk, criticized Orr
for neglecting to mention arts as
an asset to Detroit's future.
"It was hard to hear him not
mention arts and culture to revi-
talize the arts at all, and instead
hear him say that he was going
to have a yard sale," Damme said
"He had an incredible opportu-
nity in this presentation to sell
Detroit on its history of art and
culture, I think creating more
sports stadiums is not the way to
empower a city."
Rackham student Kumar Raj,
an event volunteer, said he appre-
ciated the opportunity to hear
firsthand what was happening
in Detroit, especially as a student
who hoped to live inthe city after
graduation.
"I think you learn a lot of the
academic side, and it's nice to
have a practitioner come and
speak to all of us on a topic as
important as Detroit," he said.
of divestment shared personal
stories of life in the Middle East
and Palestine specifically. Stu-
dents against the resolution reit-
erated sentiments that passage
of this resolution would further
divide the student body.
While CSG executive officers
are not permitted to vote on mat-
ters of the assembly, they did
address the room before mem-
bers of the assembly began their
debates.
Proppe advised representa-
tives to consider the strong divi-
sion of student opinion regarding
the resolution when considering
its passage. He added that he does
not think those representatives
who voted to indefinitely post-
pone the resolution did so with
the intent to silence students.
CSG Vice President Bobby
Dishell, a Public Policy junior,
said as a student leader, he less-
ened his involvement with pro-
Israel groups once he became a
representative. He reiterated that
he remains pro-Israel, but does
not want his own political beliefs
to influence his role as vice presi-
dent.
Dishell and LSA sophomore
Meagan Shokar, speaker of the
assembly, said the hostile cam-
pus climate in the wake of the
March 18 meeting threatens the
democratic process and would
not be tolerated. SAFE represen-
tatives told The Michigan Daily
that members have been receiv-
ing racist comments, have been
yelled at on the street by people
driving by and have been classi-
fied as extremists. CSG members
claimed to receive similar threats
and members ofbothgroups have
reported some individuals do not
feel safe enough to attend their
classes.
Administrators have met
repeatedly with SAFE and the
members of the sit-in, as well as
other groups, hearing the vari-
ous accounts of threats received

by CSG representatives as well as
members of the sit-in. In antici-
pation of the meeting, E. Royster
Harper, vice president for student
life, sent a campus-wide e-mail
early Tuesday evening reminding
students of the University's poli-
cy regarding freedom of speech
and artistic expression outlined
in its Standard Practice Guide.
She urged students to remain
respectful and tolerant of diverse
viewpoints.
Harper referred to a previous
Daily article, an official response
from Proppe and a statement
from Palestinian students and
allies to provide students with
context of the issue.

The ice cream base will consist
entirely of eggs, cane sugar and
milk, free of any added preserva-
tives, stabilizers or emulsifiers. All
of the add-ins, such as peanut but-
ter cups, will also be organic or
natural.
"We're trying to make an all-
natural product, that even though
you're indulging, you can feel good
about eating - something that's a
whole food," Segler said.
The store will feature a glass
wall to allow customers to look in
onthe processofmakingice cream.
The store will also include games,
chalkboards and slates for children
to draw on - providing inspiration
for the creamery's name.

"It kind of sucks the car down
to the ground," he said. "It's the
same concept that keeps air-
planes in the air, just reversed to
keeping the car on the ground."
Engineering Prof. Jason Martz,
MRacing's faculty adviser, said
the program's value comes from
students' ability to learn by doing.
"FormulaSAE providesuswith
a beneficial, real-world aspect
to our students' education," he
said. "The strong fundamentals
acquired here in the classroom
at the University of Michigan are
applied to real-world problems
through participation on this
team."
Martz addedthatconcepts such
as internal combustion theory and
thermodynamics find practical
application in the building of a
motor vehicle, which makes them
more pertinent to study.

and a local chocolate store to add
to her bank of flavors. Though
Segler wants to keep the focus on
ice cream, sundaes and shakes, she
also mentioned the possibility of
introducing soup to the menu dur-
ing winter months.
Segler's idea to open a new ice
cream store did not materialize
overnight. She first first conceived
the idea when she was in her twen-
ties. To start, she visited an inde-
pendent shop in Massachusetts to
learn how all-natural ice cream is
made and to see whether opening
a store was something she really
wanted to do. After learning the
basics, she returned to Michigan
to perfect her flavors and propor-
tions.
Segler said she hopes to bring
something newto Ann Arbor while
keeping a local feel.
"We think our product is a good
match with what people in the
downtown area are looking for,"
Segler said. "We didn'twantto be a
Joe Fadool, the president of
BorgWarner Morse TEC, spoke
at the event as well. BorgWarner
- an international company that
develops technologies to improve
motor vehicle emissions, fuel
economy and performance - is
MRacing's title sponsor.
"We believe in the work that all
the administrators and professors
are doing right here in Ann Arbor,"
he said. "It is this type of work that
develops the next generation of
scientists, engineers and leaders
that we need for our industry."
Fadool also encouraged the stu-
dents involved with MRacing to
consider the automotive industry
as a viable future career option
- contrary to what some might
argue.
"The automotive industry is
back," he said.
In the comingweeks, MRacing
students will test-drive the For-
mula SAE car. Four of the orga-
nization's members, all of whom
have some form of previous rac-
ing experience, will operate the
vehicle in upcoming competi-
tions.
The vehicle will compete in
three races: one at the Michigan
International Speedway, another

shop in atypical strip mall."
Rather than thinking of the new
store as competition, the owners of
other ice cream shops in Ann Arbor
said the Blank Slate Creamery will
be a good addition to the commu-
nity.
LSA senior Nick Lemmer, owner
of Iorio's Gelateria on East William
Street, said ice cream and gelato
are very different products.
"Gelato is made with different
ingredients, so while it is a little bit
of competition, it's not direct com-
petition," Lemmer said. "We're
excited that another frozen dessert
place will be coming to Ann Arbor
because I think it's important for
the market itself."
Chera Tramontin, owner of
Kilwin's on East Liberty, said she
did not have any concerns with
competition posed by a new ice
cream establishment.
"I think that's great for Ann
Arbor, and I wish them the best of
luck," Tramontin said.

the Hockenheimring, a race track
in Germany.
Martin said the unveiling is an
important "first milestone" for
the team prior to competing in
the string of racing events.
"It's the first time that every-
body gets to see all the compo-
nents together," he said. "You get
to see all of your work culminate
into something that looks like
a car instead of just a bunch of
parts lying around."
Regardless of the vehicle's
performance in upcoming races,
Munson added, the MRacing
program's value exceeds its com-
petitive results. That said, an
MRacing vehicle has placed in
the top 10 in nine out of its last 10
competitions.
Martin added that their orga-
nization ranks 36th out of 500
teams in the world.
"We look forward to this year's
Formula SAE competition series,"
Munson said. "Yes, we want to
win, but regardless of the out-
come, because of the experiences
and the skills created by this
opportunity, every team member
is a winner, and those of you who
support them are victors."

Vote FORUM
The Michigan Daily editorial board endorses Manes and Abraham
entral Student Government's main purpose is to represent the
student body, to gauge the needs of University students and work
to implement beneficial changes. While current CSG leadership has
been effective in bringing about change - such as working to implement a
new football seating policy - its efforts have not encompassed the entirety
of campus. The next leaders of CSG should strive to fairly incorporate
traditionally unheard voices in student government in order to better
represent all students at the University. Except for one party, most of the
CSG presidential and vice presidential candidates are running on a platform
that is either too vague or overly narrow to the point of being exclusionary.
The Michigan Daily's editorial board is endorsing FORUM candidates
Carly Manes and Pavitra Abraham for CSG president and vice president
because of their inclusive vision and their plan to empower students.

Weight of thaw
. -

While Make Michigan candidates have solid
experience in student government, their plans
for the future do not fully address current
campus concerns. Presidential candidate Bobby
Dishell, a Public Policy junior, is currently
serving as CSG vice president and vice
presidential candidate Meagan Shokar, an LSA
sophomore, is the CSG speaker of the assembly.
Their proposed initiatives for next year focus
primarily on improving the student experience
through campus technology - namely the
Michigan smartphone app - and mental
health. While mental health is an issue that
should be addressed by student government
- and something FORUM should emphasize
- there are other areas of campus life that
deserve attention as well. Specifically, campus
diversity, as proven by the #BBUM movement,
is an issue the future student government
should be concerned with. Bringing together
the large campus community and ensuring
every voice is heard should also be a major
focus. Make Michigan's past experience in'
student government may prove valuable, but its
lack of a comprehensive vision is problematic.
Independent candidate Aristide
Coumarbatch, an LSA senior, is running
under the premise of setting a good example
for other students, showing the importance of
creating equality and implementing diversity.
Coumarbatch decided to forgo the support of a
party to demonstrate to students that running
for CSG president is achievable by everyone.
Having no affiliation with a previous party or
experience as a representative, Coumarbatch
is completely new to CSG. Though he stresses
a "fight for change" and a need to "increase
diversity," Coumarbatch doesn't offer any
specific direction toward execution of these
goals. With a lack of objective and no previous
experience with the inner workings of the CSG,
we're uncertain as to what Coumarbatch would
be able to successfully accomplish.
From the Defend Affirmative Action Party,
LSA sophomore Mical Holt and LSA freshman
Taylor Jones are running for CSG president and
vice president. The party offers a strong vision
for improving the climate around social justice
on campus and should be commended for its
initiative in tackling one of the University's
most pressingissues. Whichever partyiselected
should strive to increase underrepresented

minority enrollment and serve as advocates for
affirmative action should the opportunity arise.
Especially in light of recent campus events, the
goals of DAAP deserve recognition from CSG.
However, as a single-issue party, DAAP's focus
is too narrow to fully serve the needs of the
entire student body.
Capitalizing on the noticeable lack of
student engagement with CSG, the Party Party
has established itself as a new alternative.
Unfortunately, the Party Party has no tangible
initiatives to support its unique approach.
The party has said that expressing specific
goals contradicts the notion that the student
body should direct CSG action. While this
philosophy is admirable, the Party Party's
lack of concrete goals is concerning and begs
the question of what exactly LSA junior Ryan
Hayes and Business junior Brennan Woods -
the party's presidential and vice presidential
candidates - would do if elected. Their call
for increased attention to student engagement
is certainly warranted, but CSG needs a leader
with a concrete vision to improve the school.
FORUM presidential candidate Carly
Manes is a Public Policy junior who has held
leadership positions in multiple student
organizations on campus and has served
on LSA Student Government as a freshman
and sophomore. Vice presidential candidate
Pavitra Abraham is also in her junior year
in LSA and is experienced in working as a
community organizer on campus. FORUM's
goal of creating a student position on the
University's Board of Regents is indicative of
the party's main focus of improving student
representation. FORUM has prioritized
students' voices by pushing an outreach
agenda to bring campus perspectives together.
In addition to an idealistic vision, Manes and
Abraham have specific proposals aimed at
improving student life. A bus route to local
grocery stores and a SafeRide app to ensure
student safety will benefit all of campus.
While such an ambitious agenda may seem
overwhelming, FORUM's plan to empower
passionate students in specific fields is a smart
and inclusive strategy.
This year, The Michigan Daily's editorial
board endorses FORUM candidates CARLY
MANES and PAVITRA ABRAHAM for CSG
president and vice president.

inescapable heaps.

probed the frozenground for morsels
each day before tucking their faces
under their wings at night.
As my senior year plodded
along, the consistently negative
temperatures made my every outdoor
movement robotic and hasty. My
friends and I would help each other
across glinting layers of sidewalk ice,
laughing in disbelief as we slipped
and gripped each other's arms.
We became both quick-footed and
cautious, learning to exploit areas
with the most traction - the blotches
of new-fallen snow, the places where
slush had formed around footprints
and then refrozen.
Our bodies ached from struggling
with gravity - spines twisted after
retracting missteps, hips wrenched
from halting mid-fall - and we
bitched over beers about kinks in our
necks like the arthritic members of a
Red HatSociety.We cobbledtogether
poetry portfolios, and wrote lengthy
theses about security checkpoints
and feminist anarchy, but even our
most vibrant conversations always
turned back to the snow.
Time compounded, as it tends
to do - days diffusing into weeks
and then into months. Months of
lungs lined with stubborn phlegm;

months of fingers fumbling withkeys
in the cold; months of smug couples
strolling around campus with their
hands tucked sweetly in each other's
parkapockets. Meanwhile,loneliness
slowed my blood flow; warmth barely
worked through me, like a weak
current trickling over a frozen river,
turning my skin gray and chilly to
the touch. Any time I left the house, I
keptmyhead down to protect myraw
cheeks from the wind; I didn'tlook at
the sky all winter.
Some moments inspired the
exaggerations I'll feed my children
when they complain about having
to don their coats on Halloween.
I'll mention the most frigid night
of the year, when my housemates
and I stayed up singing and sucking
down pulls of whiskey, afraid the
heat would silently fail and give
us over to hypothermia as we
slept. I'll tell them about how my
parents feared their roof would
collapse under the weight of its ice
blanket, and in the mornings, in
that moment between dream and
waking, I imagined my childhood
home as a mound of white rubble,
the family dog barking and digging
desperately through the snow.
But, despite all doubts, this
morning I looked out my window to
find March waiting for me - as she
always does at this time of year -
with the gift of thaw in her hands.
The sidewalk ice is receding to
reveal lost treasures - car keys,
lipstick tubes, pushpins, dropped
tampons, hubcaps, that lone
and forsaken mitten. The geese
survived. My parents' roof isstill
intact. But as its shingles reemerge,
and the mountains of plowed snow
on the Diag shrink to nothing, all of
that weight remains.
Though I'm no longer skidding
down these streets, bent and

VIRGINIAEASTHOPE/Daly
braced for the cold, my shoulders
don't seem any looser or lighter.
While I should be rejoicing -
cartwheeling across the prickly
grass and inhaling a little sunshine
- I actually feel heavier than I did
in the midst of the Polar Vortex.
The weight of ice has been
replaced by the reality of spring, the
reality that this is my last month of
living my current life. The monot-
ony that was encouraged by this
urban tundra - circuits between
class, work, bar, sleep, class, work,
bar, sleep - seduced me into this
city's collective hibernation, and
tricked me into thinking time had
slowed. But now that my internal
calendar is thawing out with the
rest of our campus, it feels like I've
overslept for months and missed
every class, every deadline, every
party, every interview, every Sun-
day brunch.
of course, this isn't a new
discovery; all students fear the end
of school, and a little panic nourishes
both ambition and the soul.
However, wisdom and reason
don't seem totake the edge off of this
trepidation, or make me any more
sure-footed as I polish off the year.
Like every senior class before us,
we face a future full of winters. Like
every class before us, we will slip
before catching ourselves on a good
friend's shoulder. Eventually, we will
land firmly on the ground, though
whether we make contact with our
feet or asses first depends entirely
on the way we fall. Either way, it will
hurt - our bodies will ache along
with-our hearts. But our lives are
changing as quickly as ice can melt
out of existence, and we have to brace
ourselves for the sudden heat of it all.

LAUREN GROSSMANN I
Stop hating and try a little empathy

Everyone carries their own problems on
their back and tries to find some blame for
things beyond their control. This past week,
we saw tensions rise at the University over an
issue about disinvesting fromthe State of Israel,
and there has been much controversy over the
result. I will be the first to admit Iam biased in
this issue. I amJewishandpro-Israel.However,
I do not think resolutions like this belong in
the hands of our student government. Its job
is to enhance the life of students on campus
and it should not be forced to play a role in a
highly polarizing issue that divides members
of the campus. People have been arguing that
members of Central Student Government have
been "cowards" because they ended the debate
on the issue by tabling the motion to end the bill
indefinitely. However, not all members of CSG
are personally invested in the issue and may
not know enough about either side to make a
justified stance on the issue. Tabling the motion
might not have been the right decision, but it
was the best given the options.
This resolution would've separated people
on campus. Yesterday, I was talking to
someone about the issue and she feared there
might have been a race issue that the campus
is ignoring. She asked me, "How does a white
privileged girl like yourself know about the
shame that the minority students feel on
campus?" My answer: I don't. I personally
cannot know what it was like to grow up as

a racial minority in white America. But, I
am Jewish and I've been a victim of anti-
Semitism. I've witnessed people putting
swastikas at a high school in my hometown,
I've been called Christ-killer, I've been told
I am going to hell for just being Jewish, and
that hurt. My grandparents were Holocaust
survivors; my grandfather survived
Mauthausen Concentration Camp. Anyone
that is a minority faces some kind of stigma
that some members of society won't accept.
I am not asking for sympathy, everyone
has their own problems. We should look past
our own problems and try to find common
ground among our social groups. We are all
students at this University who come from all
backgrounds. We come together to make this
campus a diverse and enriching atmosphere.
We should embrace those differences and find
things that make us the same. People reading
this might call me a racist just because of my
stance on the issue. Iam willing to sit and talk
in an open forum. I am willing to talk and
listen - you might find out we have more in
common than we realize.
People need to stop blaming others for
actions that are beyond their control. It hinders
cooperation and growth. It divides us. Blaming
CSG is not goingto solve the issue,.it's just going
to raise tensions further.

There's a certain excitement
thatcomes from seeingafaceyou'd
typically view from the comfort
of your bed, via Netflix, on a big
screen. TV has been the starting
point for many successful film act-
ing careers: Sally Field, Meg Ryan
and George Clooney are a few
names that should ring a bell. In
recent years, however, as TV has
grown to the level of film in popu-
lar culture and households, many
actors are making the transition in
the other direction.

as I know, no one throws viewing
parties for the Emmys.
That being said, in the last
decade, TVhas undergone a trans-
formation in that it now strives for
more than entertainment value
and ratings; it is aspace for artistry
and style, in the same waythat film
has been from its onset. The shows
that are products of these recent
years have offered us profound
social commentary, masterful act-
ing and significantly more exciting
weeknights. Series such as "The
Sopranos," "Breaking Bad" and
"Mad Men" demonstrate TV'strue

TV is sexier

Withthisinmind, it'snowonder
that film stars, such as Halle Berry
and Kevin Bacon, are making the
crossover. Suddenly, opportunities
for stimulating and rewarding
work have snowballed. In the
search for dynamic characters
and meaningful stories, actors are
no longer limited to film scripts.
Being in a TV show expands the
horizons in other ways as well. A
film script offers the rising action,
climax and resolution of a story
in a single read. Of course, this
means faster gratification for both

in this for actors who are hungry
for greater personal freedom and

TV is sexy in a way that mov-
ies can't be; its indefinite resolu-
tions, longevity and the continual
necessity for surprises make it
unique. It's not as if people didn't
catch onto this earlier, but the
results are most evident today. If
the trend continues, and actorslike
McConaughey or Kevin Spacey
continue to recognize and appre-
ciate the merits of TV roles, then
we can expect TV's golden age to
continue. absurd in the process.

Reveling in the
'McConaissance'

ByKARENYUAN
DailyArts Writer
It's 2005. "Sahara," a movie
starring Matthew McCo-
naughey and Penelope Cruz,

College Chicago. After the
screening, the producers -
one of whom is McConaughey
- hold a Q&A session with
their audience. The theater is

is less surprising than it ini-
tially seems, because McCo-
naughey was never necessarily
a bad actor. He was just con-
stantly typecasted, featured
in the same genre of movies
as the same kind of character
again and again. It's entirely
possible, however, to be simul-
taneously typecast and good at
acting, as evidenced by John
Wayne (macho gunslinger)
and Morgan Freeman (wise
old sage).
"How to Lose a Guy in 10
Days" (2003), for example,
includes perfectly timed
comedic delivery from McCo-
naughey, down to the careful
pauses between words and
subtle expressions. Though
the movie's story is nothing
groundbreaking - it's a run-
of-the-mill fluff piece on rela-
tionships - McConaughey
works as much as he can to
flesh out his character. Even
in his films from the 2000s,
we see a watered-down but
certainly visible glimpse of
McConaughey's true acting
potential. The McConaughey
of today is not a new person,
but rather a more ambitious
version of yesterday's.

plete disregard for melody. Still,
more than any other album, I
love putting it on in my car with
the volume on full blast and
screaming along to every word.
I was so happy when I found
more of the same music with
your old band, Lifter Puller, and
I'm just as big of a fan of all the
other Hold Steady records. But
when I heard your last album,
Heaven is Whenever, a record
that had some perfectly crafted
songs but also a softened edge, I
started to brace myself for this.
Teeth Dreams, your latest
effort, is the inevitable aging of
a band that I've always wanted
to stay young. Instead of the
unhinged ranting about "the
scene" and the kids who inhabit
it, you're slipping soft rock into
your setlists now. Truthfully, it's
not all bad, but I still can't help
being disappointed.
You actually sing now, Craig.
You're less primal and, frankly,
less exciting. The Hold Steady is
playing more straight-forward
rock, and you've lost the thrill-
ing danger of not conforming
to old notions about vocals and
melodies. You're classic rock
now, not anything resembling
punk. It's quaint, and it's also
much more normal and play-by-
the-numbers. Lyrics that were
once so specific they made you
feel like you were there with the
song's characters are now just
vague "anthems." Even the first
two singles, "I Hope This Whole
Thing Didn't Frighten You" and
"Spinners," are less memorable
than the weakest stuff on Sepa-
ration Sunday.
I really hate to be the guy
who never wants the bands he
loves to change their sound, but
Teeth Dreams is a frustrating
album. It's just not charismatic
or emotional enough for the bar
you've set. However, that's not
to say this is all terrible. Right
in the middle, with songs like
"On With the Business" and "Big
Cig," you still prove you have
that attitude, that snarl. Sure,
you're getting older, Craig, but I
still love your voice when it's at
its best, spitting out portraits of
life around you like a Beat poet.

It's a little more restrained, but
that's understandable, and I
can't fault that.
It's hard to know if I should
judge the album on normal-
band standards, or compared to
your old stuff. Oddly, the singles
might be the weakest songs, the
ones with the fewest risks. It's
all fine rock music, but you guys
just have so much more to offer.
Even "Oaks," the closing track -
a spot on your albums that has
been home to some true classics
- can't match the power of the
old closers.
Maybe this album is a grow-
er. Maybe I'm rushing to judge
because this isn't what I was
expecting. I don't want anoth-
er album, though, where I can
listen and say "Oh, this song
sounds like Pearl Jam. This one
sounds like Wilco. This one
sounds like Tom Petty," because
when The Hold Steady is at its
best, you can't compare it to any
other band.
What gives me hope, more
than anything, is the second-to-

last song, "Almost Everything."
It's an optimistic acoustic love
song - something I don't think
you've ever done before. I love
it. You still so enjoyably describe
the smallest details with pin-
point accuracy. I just feel good
listening to it, and I'm extremely
confident that you have so much
great music left in you, Craig.
Growing up isn't an artistic
death sentence, but it does force
you to adapt. Teeth Dreams is the
often-awkward sound of The
Hold Steady trying to navigate
this adaptation. As much as I'll
miss the tales of Suburban Min-
neapolis, I'm very excited for the
next chapter of your career.
Sincerely,
Forever a Member of The Uni-

Offensive line

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
Minus-48.
Kyle Bosch's first career start
at Michigan is one he's not likely
to forget. On Nov. 2, 2013, the
guard was part of an offensive
line that was systematically
embarrassed by Michigan State
to the tune of seven sacks and
nearly half a football field of
negative yardage.
Months later, the sophomore
still hasn't forgotten the
surprise of being at the top of
the depth chart for that game,
or the speed with which the
Spartans played. But some of
the Wolverines' shortcomings
weren't just physical, and they
should be fixed this fall, he said.
According to Bosch, one
of the offensive line's biggest
issues last year was schematic.
The transition from former
offensive coordinator Al
Borges to Doug Nussmeier has
been welcomed because of an
increase in simplicity, leading
to players actually knowing
where to go.
As a result, Michigan has
managed more long-yardage
running plays than last year so
far in its spring practices.
"Coach Nussmeier's system is
much easier to apprehend than
Coach Borges' because some of

the names of plays - they're
names of animals, it's common
terminology," Bosch said. "It's
not a numbered system, so it's
easier to pick up.
"We've definitely dumbed it
down. One call is one call. In the
last offensive system, one call
could mean you're going right,
or it could mean you're going left
- you had to distinguish that
call with another call. So three
offensive linemen would be
going right, two would be going
left. That's why we would get
negative 15 yards. Now, we're
all on the same page when we're
runningthe play."

native, who is -

The offensive line lost two
NFL-bound tackles in Taylor
Lewan and Michael Schofield
from last year's unit, but that
hasn't all been detrimental.
In 2013, the group didn't bond
very well - both because of
the playbook difficulties and
incompatibilities off the field.
So far this spring, that hasn't

been an issue, and the line
spends much of its free time
together.
"I think the five of us all
being young is really allowing
us to mesh and come together
the way we didn't last year,"
said redshirt sophomore guard
Kyle Kalis. "I think we're going
to be pretty good this year.
"Having (Lewan and
Schofield) was crucial for
helping us grow and stuff,
but it's a totally different
experience now."
The revamped offense will

fall, especially during the

"The fact
that we played 24 straight games
on the road is in itself its own
challenge," said Michigan coach
Erik Bakich. "It's going to be
good to start playing some home
games."
Michigan hasn't won a home
opener since 2010, and 17 of its
24 games this season have ended
in a one- or two-run differential.
If the Wolverines can't produce
at the plate, Wednesday may be
no different than home openers
in years past.
Last weekend, the Broncos
(1-2 Mid-American Conference,
10-10 overall) competed in
their first conference games
against Miami, but Tuesday's
nonconference game against
Northwestern was canceled due

to poor field conditions.
Western Michigan's biggest
offensive weapon is third
baseman Kurt Hoekstra, who is
hitting .480. From the mound,
the Broncos have a 3.93 ERA,
good for third in the MAC, and
will start Derek Schneider.
The left-hander earned a win
against the Wolverines last year,
allowing only one run and two
hits through two innings.
Opposite Schneider is senior
right-hander Alex Lakatos, who
has pitched seven innings with a
1.73 ERA, including the last out
of a fifth-inning jam in Sunday's
4-3 win over Indiana.

Know your foe: Getting to know Tennessee

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
Fans of the Michigan men's
basketball team aren't that
unfamiliar with Tennessee,
the Wolverines' Sweet 16
opponent. In a first-round NCAA
Tournament game just three
years ago, Michigan dismantled
the Volunteers, 75-45.
But this Tennessee team is
a completely different squad,
beginning at the top. Michigan's
blowout was a clear enough
sign to the Volunteer athletic
department that coach Bruce
Pearl had lost his team, ushering
in the Cuonzo Martin regime.
Martin himself was on the
hot seat just a few weeks ago, but
three NCAA Tournament wins
in the past week have prompted
some analysts to label Tennessee
the hottest team in America.
The Daily breaks down
the Volunteers so you'll be
prepared for Friday's matchup in
Indianapolis.

feature a lineup that's filled with
talent - especially in forward
Jarnell Stokes, who averages a
double-double, and guard Jordan
McRae, who shot his way to seven
games of 25 or more points - but
the team's effort has come into
question at times.
That dichotomy shows in the
highs of Tennessee's wins -
including a 35-point December
blowout over Virginia, currently
a No. 1 seed in the Sweet 16
- and the lows of some of its
losses, including a season sweep
at the hands of a mediocre Texas
A&M team and an early-season
loss to UTEP.
Playing in the top-heavy SEC,
11of the Volunteers' 12 conference
wins were by double digits, six of
those by 18 or more. Only one of
their 12 losses this season, a 67-41
drubbing at No. 1 Florida, was by
double digits.
After inexplicably losing
six conference games that

The fact of the matter is that
the Volunteers are, again, a
talented team that, since the end
of February has finally begun to
play up to its potential.
Tennessee began its
Tournament path against Iowa
in what's technically the first
round, but is reserved for the last
eight teams in. In that game, the
Volunteers needed overtime to
get past the reeling Hawkeyes.
It took a late-game comeback
for the Tennessee defense to
come alive. When it did, it flexed
its muscles in style, holding the
dangerous Iowa offense to a

"We're not promoting conflict, we're
promoting discussion," he said. "And
we're promoting justice, through BDS or
whatever campaign it is to bring awareness
of this."
Both Erzouki and Kherallah stressed
that SAFE does hold dialogues and teach-
ins -the group held a dialogue after the
mock eviction, for example - but as an
activist organization, they also find it
important to take on projects such as the
mock evictions.
Not a silenced campus: Moving forward
It's unclear what will happen next: if
this is just a temporary rise in activity
around the issue, or if the increased focus
is here to stay.
This isn't the first time BDS, or the
conflict in general, has made waves on
campus. In 2005 and 2011, CSG voted
down resolutions to divest, though the
subject of the 2011 vote was broader than
just companies tied to Israel and Palestine.
In 2012, campus erupted in response to an
e-mail sent out by a member of a pro-Israel
student group accusing Omar Hashwi, then
a candidate for CSG vice president, whose
platform included advocating for "socially
responsible investments" of being anti-
Israel and homophobic. For at least the past
decade, there has been a succession of well-
attended, high-energy protests on campus.
In the end, none of these high notes were
enough to change the persistent issues of
identity and campus climate still reported
by students today.
However, this academic year isn't over
quite yet.
Two weeks ago, SAFE introduced a
resolution before CSG that would use the
body's influence to call on the University to

divest from the four companies it views as
assisting the Israeli military in committing
alleged human rights violations against
Palestinians.
On the night of the March 18, CSG
representatives voted to postpone the
resolution indefinitely, sparking protests
both that night and the following days
in the form of a SAFE sit-in at the CSG
chambers, which lasted seven days as of
Tuesday.
At Tuesday's meeting, CSG president
Michael Proppe, a Business senior,
motioned to reconsider the tabling of
the divestment resolution. After a series
of votes by CSG members, which were
preceded by a speaker and a 90-minute
community concerns section during which
proponents of both sides expressed their
opinions, the vote on the resolution was
opened early Wednesday morning.
After five hours of debate and discussion,
at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, the
divestment resolution failed to pass.
Following the announcement of the vote,
a speaker for supporters of the resolution
told attendees to walk out silently, and that
the next step was the University's Board of
Regents.
In the end, the visibility that the BDS
campaign has garnered over the past two
semesters - from the mock evictions to the
resolution and protests - might be what's
most important, regardless of its success in
getting the University to divest, Hamdan
said.
"That's the reality check, why do a lot
of students want a divestment?" Hamdan
said. "I think the BDS movement is a way to
understand a little bit what other students
on campus are feeling. And even if it makes
them uncomfortable and raises conflict, it's
better than us living on a silenced campus.

r ann arbor affairs: just words by tanaz ahmed

My fourth grade teacher, Ms.
Savur, probably had no idea that
her praise of my mystery pic-
ture book, painstakingly woven
together with pale blue yarn and
featuring a madcap plot of miss-
ing jewelry and secret bathroom
passageways, would lead to argu-
ments with my parents at age 18
and, eventually, culminate in the
first English major in my family.
Ever since I learned how to
read, I loved doing it. I read every-
thing I could get my hands on. I
was an avid reader of cereal boxes,
airplane safety guides, "The Baby-
sitters Club" books ... You name
it and I probably wanted to read
it - that is, if I hadn't gotten to it
already. I was proud of this fact
about myself. I beamed when, in
third grade, I read the most books
of any student in my class. I held
my head high when, during the
summer before fourth grade, my
d d
family made fun of me for read-
ing (attempting, really) "The
Fellowship of the Rings" and car-
rying around a dictionary. I barely
understood what was going on
and it scared the shit out of me, but
I loved every minute of it.
It wasn't until Ms. Savur told
me what a good writer I was that
I got this notion in my head - I

could be some-
one whose
works other
nerdy kids (like
me) could pick
up and read one
day. Starting
that day, I was a
writer. Thus, it

may, this was not just a phase
that I eventually grew out of or a
dream that I soon became disillu-
sioned with.
Everything came to a head dur-
ing my senior year of high school.
All anybody - including my par-
ents - wanted to know about me
was what I wanted to major in, and
what my future career plans were.
I was honest. I wanted to spend the
rest of my life writing. I wasn't sure
if it would be through journalism,
creative fiction, technical writing
- but I was going to always write.
This was mostly met with a range
of negative reactions. "What will
you do with a major in English?"
"You won't be able to support your-
self!" "There's a high chance you're
going to be living with your par-
ents for the rest of your life."
I disregarded all the negativity.
Maybe I was - and am - delu-
sional, but only time will tell and
I'm willing to see it through.
My parents and I have come to
an understanding of sorts by now.
They have accepted that I'm stub-
born and pigheaded. Conversely,
I've accepted that in a family of

engineers, doctors and lawyers,
it's hard to have a daughter who
wants to be a writer. However,
many still don't understand why
I do what I do. I could tell people
about becoming an effective com-
municator or developing criti-
cal thinking and problem solving
skills, but the truth is, I write
because it's what makes me happy.
Perhaps this is a cliche, but it's at
the heart of my ambitions. Spend-
ing hours trying to pin down my
floating thoughts, obsessing over
synonyms and comma placements
fills me with a kind of frenzied
excitement that I can't adequate-
ly explain. Writing is painful,
frustrating, time-consuming but
ultimately the most rewarding
activity that I do. Nothing can
come close to the sense of ful-
fillment that comes from look-
ing at one of my finished writing
pieces. Words on a sheet of paper
are not just words for me. With-
in the graceful curl and sharp
edge of each and every word, my
emotions, thoughts, desires and
dreams are embedded.

"What would you like, Ma'am?" Outside,

"Grande, extra-hot-no-foam latte,

tongue like a prayer. No foam, I've learned,

"Ma'am, that's your 12th star. This

She spreads a satisfied smile. Starbucks

"Water, please," I say. It's vacation, and
coffee - for me - is off the menu
I must have been about seven years old
when I first encountered the drink. I was
always an early riser and so was Mom, and
she had her routine - a breakfast of one
mug, French-pressed, no sugar. Nothing
else.
I would sit across the table, more focused
on landingthe perfectratioof syrup to chal-

I had assumed. And then she asked,"Wanna

I had looked into the brown blackness
and wondered how old grown-ups were. I
sipped, and yucked.
"Bitter," I said.
Mom smiled. She knew I wouldn't like it.
But then Mocha Frappuccinos happened.

It's visiting day, and my first summer as a
"two-monther," at camp. I'm twelve maybe.

"I need a coffee," Mom says. I groan and

"What would you like Ma'am?"
"Grande iced dopio, please." Her summer

"I'll have a small Mocha Frappuccino,"
my older sister says.
"Whipped cream?"
"Yes, please
The barista looks at me. I usually settle
for a hot chocolate, but I like the sound of
'whipped cream.
"Um ... I'll have the same please, with

Mom looks at me, surprised.
"Dain, you know that has caffeine in it?"
"I know it has whipped cream in it."
"Please make it decaf, miss."
I couldn't have cared less. The frappa-

was even caramel drizzle on top.

Discovering identity: Birthright trips as individual experience
by Katie Burke

the thought bubble

Free trips are often advertised as a sweep-
stakes grand prize or a selling point for a
family vacation. For Jewish youth, however,
one free trip in particular provides a way to
explore and experience an ancient and com-
plicated identity.
Taglit-Birthright is a 10-day, expenses-
paid trip to Israel for Jewish 18 to 26 year
olds around the world. Charles Bronfman,
former co-chairman of Seagrams, and
Michael Steinhardt, an American hedge
fund manager, founded the program in
1999, in cooperation with the Israeli gov-
ernment, the Jewish Agency of Israel,
private philanthropists and international
Jewish communities.
Israel was established as a Jewish state
in 1948, fueling territorial disputes that
have at times escalated to armed confron-
tations, and continue today.
The area in which Israel is located has
ties to all three major monotheistic reli-
gions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
The city of Jerusalem is home to major
holy sites for each religion, from the
Western Wall to the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre to the Dome of the Rock, and
attracts millions of tourists each year.
The Taglit-Birthright program has
sparked similar trips, such as Birthright
Armenia, Reconnect Hungary and Birth-
right Greece.
To be eligible for the trip, one mustbe able
to trace Jewish heritage from at least one
parent and have not been in Israel for three
consecutive months since the age of 12.
More than 350,000 people from 64 coun-
tries have participated in Birthright trips
since 1999, with 65,000 of those being from
Israel - Israeli citizens join trips for about
half of the 10-day period. About 80 percent of
participants are from the United States, with
most Americans coming from New York.
The word 'Taglit' means discovery in
Hebrew, and with about 20 different Birth-
right trip providers, participants are able to
discover what it means to be Jewish with
an array of trip options. Noa Bauer, vice
president of international marketing at
Birthright Israel, said trips range from high-
tech-focused to LGBTQ-focused to culinary-
focused.
"(The trip providers) have different
visions," Bauer said. "But at the end of the day
they give a very similar trip."
Common aspects shared among these
trips include visits to Jewish holy sites in the
Old City of Jerusalem as well as interactions
with Jewish Israeli citizens that are the same
age as trip participants. For trips consisting
of 18 to 22 year olds, this means their Israe-
li counterparts are members of the Israeli
Defense Forces, as two years of military ser-
vice for women and three years of military
service for men are compulsory after gradu-

ating from high school.
"(Trip participants) get to be in contact
with people their own age that serve the
country, which usually has a big impact,"
Bauer said. "And they keep in touch, that's
their connection to Israel."

LSA junior Natasha Dabrowski, a Birth-
right representative on campus, is a self-
proclaimed Hebrew school dropout, but said
her experience on Birthright allowed her to
connect with the Jewish faith on a more per-
sonalized level.

Bauer said there have been no major safety
concerns since the program's founding, other
than a few minor incidents of which she
could not provide details.
She added that the program has received
some negative attention internationally
through social media, though such criticism
has not been taken further.
University students have the chance
to travel on Birthright through Hillel, a foun-
dation on campus that provides program-
ming for Jewish students. Hillel provides its
Birthright trips through IsraelExperts, with
a focus on University students forming their
own experience and connection to their Jew-
ish identity.
According to Rosen, the University has
sent between 100 and 200 students on Birth-
right trips for the past threeyears. Trips
are led by one Hillel staff member, one stu-
dent staff member and one tour guide pro-
vided by IsraelExperts.
Assistant Director of Hillel, Davey Rosen,
said students who participate in trips through
Hillel are not steered toward one specific def-
inition of what it is to be Jewish.
"Michigan Hillel is a pluralist organiza-
tion," Rosen said. "We want students to expe-
rience different ways of being Jewish and to
make your own decision of what it means to
be Jewish, because we believe there are many
ways to be Jewish and Birthright also offers
that opportunity."

"While I don't consider myself the most
religious person, I do think that the lessons
learned through religion can shape how you
live your life and how you perceive others,"
Dabrowski said. "I take it through an educa-
tional perspective and as a basis for commu-
nity relations."
Students must go through an application
process in order to travel on a Birthright
trip. The first step is a general online appli-
cation through Taglit-Birthright, followed
by another application through the trip pro-
vider, then in-person interviews with Hillel
staff.
Rosen said the multi-step process is to
ensure students fit the Birthright eligibility
requirements and thatstudents are genuinely
interested and open-minded toward connect-
ing with their Jewish identity.
During the trip, students have the chance
to reflect on their personal connection with
their faith through spending time in the des-
ert and hikes up Masada, a plateau in South-
ern Israel that was the site of some of King
Herod's palaces and fortifications.
LSA junior Rachel Rickles said visiting
these sites was especially significant during
her trip.
"To be there where all this history had
taken place, it was a relatively unique experi-
ence for me," Rickles said. "Visiting the city
of old Jerusalem, that was something I had
been learning about in Hebrew school and

throughout my childhood and to then see it
in real life and see things come alive is really
special."
Hillel trips attempt to focus on the diver-
sity of the country of Israel during the 10-day
span. Rosen said topics such as environmen-
talism and what it means to be a part of a
national Jewish majority are discussed
throughout the trips.
"We don't shy away from politics,"
Rosen said.
While trips stay within the borders of
Israel and do not travel to the disputed
regions of the West Bank or Gaza Strip,
students do have the opportunity to inter-
act with people outside of the Jewish Israe-
li community.
Business sophomore Sam Klein said
he gained greater insight into the variety
of political divisions existing within the
country during his trip.
"I was able to hear from an alternate
perspective, one morning we had a talk
with a Palestinian living in Israel and it
was interesting to hear what it was like for
her," Klein said.
Rosen said students also have the oppor-
tunity to travel to the city of Sderot in the
Western region of the country. The city
is within a mile of Gaza and is subject to
daily rocket attacks, which have caused
13 deaths since 2001, according to BBC
reports. However, there have been no secu-
rity issues on Hillel-provided trips in its his-
tory.
He added that Hillel occasionally receives
questions and comments from University
students of Palestinian descent when adver-
tising Birthright trips on campus. While Hil-
lel advocates for open discussion on campus.
Rosen maintained that Birthright trips are
specifically designed for students of Jewish
heritage.
Dabrowski said the experiences on Birth-
right trips can help facilitate a more informed
discussion of the problems surrounding the
area when students return to the United
States.
"These issues are so complicated, you do
need a starting point so you have more of a
general background, whether that's through
a history class at Michigan or something to
understand the nature of the conflict, then
you can more understand the modern inter-
actions of people," she said. "I do think that's
something we can bring back to campus."
Rosen said Birthright trips aim to high-
light these complexities and continue to
spark curiosity and conversation about the
region.
"Israel is complicated, and beautiful, and
sad all at the same time." he said. "It would
be sad if a student thought Israel is perfect. It
wouldn't lead to a lasting, realistic relation-
ship."

' ' on the record
"While I would have preferred the decision to have
been made by Michiganders themselves or their elected
representatives, I'm happy that I and so many others now
have the same right to marry as straight Wolverines in the
state of Michigan."
- RUSSELL HAYES, LSA senior and chairman of the
University's chapter of the College Republicans
"I remind everyone of the lesson we learned from
Athletics: administrators might not have all the
answers."
- MICHAEL PROPPE, Business senior and CSG president
"The fact of the matter is, unlike what Newt Gingrich
would have you believe, Palestinians are not an invented
people and neither are the realities we are telling you of.
The occupation has real consequences, on real people,
with real lives. And our University's investments have
real consequences."

've always been aware of the Palestinian
struggle and the Palestinian cause before
coming to college," said LSA senior Bayan
Founas. "But at the time, I never understood
how important it was to connect it to my
personal identity."
Founas is a member of Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality - a campus organization
thatpromotes activismregardingissues related
to Palestinian social justice and human rights.
She said her experiences with identity politics
and Arab- and Muslim-American issues at the
University pushed her to get involved in the
Arab-Israeli debate on campus.
For many students, the history and politics of
the conflict between Palestine and Israel might
have been issues that were made familiar to
them by their upbringing. But for others, these
topics may be completely new.
"Before you're aware of all these things,
you don't really engage with them," said LSA
senior Yazan Kherallah, referring to many of
the same issues Founas brought up, such as
identity politics and challenges faced by Arabs
and Arab-Americans.
Kherallah, SAFE's Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions chair, became motivated to engage
in issues related to the conflict as a freshman
in response to the Arab Spring, a wave of
government-topplingcivil protests that started
in Middle Eastern countries in 2010. As a
Syrian, Kherallah said he wanted to learn more
about the region and even his own identity.
"The Arab Spring, what it really spurred me
to do is just to engage with things and figure
out what can you do on a concrete basis to
improve situations, and stand up for my rights
and other people's rights," Kherallah said.
LSA sophomores Erica Mindel and Becca
Levin, of I-Lead and the Israel Cohort,
respectively, said they became more engaged
in the issues surrounding the conflict early on.
Both took a gap year in Israel before coming to
the University.
"I think that I've always been aware that
there's a conflict in the region," Levin said.
"I definitely see my awareness of it and my
interest in it starting in high school and then
growing in Israel because I was able to explore
it firsthand as much as I could."
Other students did not become involved in
the issues of the region until they came to the
University.
"I think when you're in high school, you
don't necessarily see the link between yourself
and BDS," said LSA senior Farah Erzouki,
SAFE co-chair. "But once you step onto a
campus where the funds of the University are
going to these companies, there's a much more
direct link."
However, for most University students,
what's going on in the Middle East or how it
may factor into their lives as students isn't
something that they're often exposed to.
In the early hours of Dec. 10, SAFE members
and supporters went to six residential dorms
and slipped mock eviction notices under the
doors of 1,500 residents as a part of the group's
boycott and divest initiative.
The notices referred to Israel's practice of
settlement building in Israeli-occupied areas
following the Six Day War in 1967. These areas,
which include the West Bank, East Jerusalem

and the Golan Heights, are generally already
populated by Palestinians. The mock eviction
notice charged that Palestinian residents are
forcibly evicted in order to make room for the
Israeli civilians who inhabit the settlements,
and asked students to imagine themselves
going through the same experience.
Overall, the goal of SAFE's Boycott,
Divestment and Sanctions campaign is to call
on the University to sever its financial ties with
several companies that hold contracts with the
Israeli military that are involved in abuses of
Palestinian human rights and the occupation
of the territories. These companies include
General Electric, Caterpillar, Heidelberg
Cement and United Technologies.
The sparks of the debate
As students woke up to the mock eviction
notices throughout the day, questions and
arguments were sparked across campus.
LSA sophomore Micah Nelson, executive
board member of JStreet Umich, a student
organization that supports a two-state solution
- a right to a homeland for both Israelis and
Palestinians - said that for her, the reactions
to the mock evictions were almost more
upsetting than the evictions themselves.
"It felt like an argument on campus to me,
between Hillel and SAFE, and I didn't feel
really comfortable in either of those spaces,"
Nelson said. Hillel is one of the largest Jewish
organizations on campus, and provides
programming for Jewish students on a variety
of issues relating to politics, faith and culture.
Many students and campus organizations
tweeted in support of SAFE with the associated
hashtag, #UMMockEvictions, but a large
number of students also expressed feelings of
being triggered and targeted by the eviction
notices.
This, in turn, led to further backlash. The
discussion not only involved BDS movements,
but also examined why the mock evictions
made people uncomfortable, questioning what
it meant to hold Jewish, Israeli or Palestinian
identities on campus.
Several months later, these questions are
still ongoing, reinvigorated by the submission
of a divestment resolution to Central Student
Government. The resolution, which would call
on the University to establish a committee to
investigate the conduct of the four companies
and divest from them, was indefinitely tabled
by the CSG Student Assembly on March 18,
leading to asit-in protest by SAFE members
and supporters.
The debate surrounding both actions has
prompted the question:What is the appropriate
way to address these issues of identity and
climate on campus?
In this case, most of the disconnect seems to
come from drastically differing views on what
student activism is and what it should achieve.
Navigatingidentities
Students with identities tied to the conflict,
suchasIsraeli,JewishandPalestinianstudents,
often find the political biases, stereotypes and
ramifications of the conflict hard to avoid even
on days where there aren't protests.

The groups' ideal outcome is a non-polarized,
non-binary campus - a place where the focus is
on dialogue between the two groups.

need to hear and celebrate all narratives.
"I don't think we're looking to just stop at
dialogue, but the point is that we need to get
back to dialogue."
Overcoming dominant viewpoints
In contrast, both SAFE and PSA
representatives, two Palestinian-focused
groups on campus, viewed actions like the

mock evictions and the BDS campaign as
necessary in challenging and overcoming what
they see as a pro-Israel dominant viewpoint on
campus and beyond.
"We live in a society where there is a very
one-sided discourse on Israel and Palestine, and
the mock eviction challenged that," Kherallah
said.
When it comes to an ideal outcome, both
SAFE and PSA are striving to avoid perceived
one-sidedness of the issue. For SAFE that means
developing mock evictions and BDS campaigns,
dialogues and teach-ins. For PSA that means n
creating opportunities for Palestinian students
to share and celebrate their cultural identity,
instead of a politicized one.
Kherallah said SAFE chose to take a more
controversial action like the mock evictions,
which have occurred on other campuses as
well, to have a more far-reaching impact.
"A lot of the time activism on this campus
is really institutionalized," Kherallah said.
"People sometimes have a very sanitized view
of what activism is. With this, it was really
groundbreaking in the sense that people who
never heard about this issue - the conflict or
the fact that their tuition money is invested in
this - had their eyes opened."
Erzouki said that SAFE felt actions like the
evictions were ultimately about expanding the
discussion and information available on the
issue.
"The University is a place where all of your
views are going to be challenged," Erzoukisaid.
"The mock evictions didn't target anybody.
They may have challenged political views, and
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
I think we're at this University to receive an
education, and to be challenged on what we've
been taught, and formulate on our opinions on -
those bases."
PSA's Batchelor expressed a similar
sentiment. He said that he viewed BDS and
similar campaigns as an opportunity to expand
the discussion to include more perspective
from the Palestinian perspective, not halt it.
