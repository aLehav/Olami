TICKET CONFUSION
Big Ten.
tickets?
Loyalty,

Policy shift awards
tourney tickets
based on mobile
app, attendance
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The senior who has missed two
home basketball games in four
years didn't receive an offer for a
student ticket to the Big Ten Men's
Basketball Tournament from the
Michigan Athletic Deparment.
Other students waited for an email
notification that never came. One
house of basketball fans hoping to
go to Chicago was led in circles by
the Michigan Ticket Office.
As the Big Ten Tournament
approaches this year, Michigan
students face two novelties: the
fourth-ranked Wolverines are
considered an earlyfavorite, and
many fans don't know how they'll
get in the building for the potential
coronation.
In a policy shift, the Michigan
Athletic Department this season
distributed student tickets to the
tournament based on loyalty to
the program, measured by game

Law dean

Caminker leaves
legacy of expansion,

By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
After lunch Friday, Law School
Dean Evan Caminker leaned back in
one of the leather armchairs in his
bright Hutchins Hall office.
"What'd I do this morningDefine
this morning," he said.
Even as Caminker concludes his
second, final term as dean he doesn't
have much time to relax. After a
decade at his post, Caminker hasn't
slowed down - his days typically
begin before dawn and end after 2
a.m.
Nodding at the can of Diet Dr.
Pepper resting on a coaster in front
of him, Caminker talked about the
e-mails, reports and appointments
that kept him awake until 4 a.m. the
night before.
"The day is so jam packed with
doing things and meeting with
people, I don't have time during the
day to make decisions or execute,"
Caminker said. "And maybe that
means I'm not the most efficient per-

Taxi driver, arraigned

Assault allegation is
third against cab drivers
since late January
By DANIELLE STOPPELMANN
Daily StaffReporter
A taxi driver for the Blue Cab compa-
ny who is accused of making unwanted
advances on a 23-year-old Ann Arbor
woman during the weekend pleaded not
guilty to two misdemeanor counts of
assault and battery during an arraign-

ment in the 15th District Court Wednes-
day. Ann Arbor Police have acknowledged
that the case is the third allegation of
"assaultive behavior" - including a rape
- that has been made against Ann Arbor
taxi drivers since late January.
The driver, Ypsilanti resident
Mohamed Ahamok, is accused of touch-
ing the passenger's leg while driving,
then parking and kissing her before she
exited the cab.
The woman - who is not a student at
the University - was picked up on the
1200 block of South University Avenue at
3:30 a.m. on Feb.10.

Judge Elizabeth Hines scheduled Aha-
mok for a pre-trial hearing on Feb. 25
and appointed him a lawyer, accordingto
court documents. Ahamok is prohibited
from having any contact with the victim
in the case.
Ahamok was released on a $10,000
personal recognizance bond, AnnArbor.

requires a defendant to pay if they don't

Students want 'U' to

By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
Led by former garment worker
Aslam Hidayat, the voices of nearly
50 students filled the Union Pond

Room chanted in Indonesian:
"Long live the workers."
With the help of a translator,
Hidayat and his co-worker Heni -
who only disclosed her first name
- shared their personal experi-
ences and financial troubles of liv-

allege are owed to-them and other
workers by the Adidas company.
Since the closing of the PT
Kizone factory - a facility that

produced Adidas apparel - in
April 2011, Hidayat and Heni have
struggled to find new jobs and pro-
vide financially for their families.
The factory owner fled the
country after the company's bank-
ruptcy, failing to pay 2;700 workers
at least $3.3 million. Nike and the
Dallas Cowboys - the two other
companies who contract with the
factory - contributed $1.5 million

Colonel Al Worden, received
two Maaters degrees in 1963
ond an honorary Doctorate of
Science in 1971, ond wos the
command module pilot for
Apollo 15, the fourth manned
lunar landing miaaion.
What did you do on the
Apollo 15 excursion?
Iflew everyone from earth
to the moon, so I got the fly-
log time. While in lunar
orbit, 80 percent of the time
I looked at the surface and
analyzed the macro-features
on the lunar surface, while
Dave Scott and Jim Irwan,
on the surface of the moon,
looked at the micro-features
such as small rocks and dust.
Ilooked at the large features

like meteor impact basons,
volcanic basons and that
kind of thing.
what did you study at
the University?
Icame hack in 1961. I was
in the Air Force, and the Air
Force had a program where
they sent some of their offi-
cers back to college because
they were in the missile busi-
ness and they needed techni-
cal people to take care of the
rockets: and 'missiles. I went
back in the guided misnile
program at the University
of Michigan, which is some-
thing that I used extensively
when I got down to Houston
because it was allf about
inertial guidance, orbital

activities, and trajectories, in
addition to all of the aviation
stuff we were taught, so it
made an ideal background to
go to Houston.
How did you get involved
Inthse space program?
I was selected because I
was good at what I did. I was
in the Air Force; and I decided
that I would be the best pilot
in the Air Force that I could
be, which meant I vsent to the
University of Michigan, got
a couple of masters' degreea,
and when they had a selection
at NASA, I had everything
they wanted.

Landowner asks
$3.9M for part of
historical land
One of the country's poorest
Native American tribes wants to
buy a historically significant piece
of land where 300 of their ances-
tors were killed, but tribal leaders
say the nearly $4 million price tag
for a property appraised at less
than $7,000 is just too much.
James Czywczynski is trying
to sell a 40-acre fraction of the
Wounded Knee National'Historic
Landmark on the Pine Ridge Indi-
an Reservationto the Oglala Sioux
Tribe. The land sits adjacent to a
gravesite where about 150 of the
300 Lakota men, women and chil-
dren killed by the 7th Cavalry in
1890 are buried.
Czywczynski, whose fam-
ily has owned the property since
1968, recently gave the tribe an
ultimatum: purchase the land for

$3.9 million or he will open up
bidding to non-Native Americans.
He said he has been trying to sell
the land to the tribe for years.

6 people in phone

British police investigating
computer hacking and privacy
offenses by the media on Wednes-

mails for the defunct News of the
World tabloid.
Authorities said the six former
journalists for the tabloid were
arrested in a new line of inquiry
to the ongoing investigation in
Operation Weeting, which is one
of three investigations into press
wrongdoing.
Britain's power structure has
been rattled by allegations that
the now-closed News of the World

The allegations and scandal have
touched off dozens of arrests.
Police say the new suspected con-
spiracy is believed to have taken

Pope Benedict XVI greets the faithful at the end of the Ash Wednesday mass in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican,
Wednesday.
Popebids tearful goodbye to
citizens at final public mass

Benedict XVI leads
Ash Wednesday
service in last
days as Pope
VATICAN CITY (AP) -
With a humble "Grazie" as
bishops doffed their mitres
and applause echoed through
St. Peter's Basilica, a frail Pope
Benedict XVI began his long
farewell by presiding over Ash
Wednesday services in a tear-
ful, final public Mass.
"We wouldn't be sincere,
Your Holiness, if we didn't tell
you that there's a veil of sadness
on our hearts this evening,"
said Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone,
Benedict's longtime deputy, his
voice breaking.
"Thank you for having given
us the luminous example of
the simple and humble worker
in the vineyard of the Lord,"

Bertone said, quoting Bene-
dict's own words when he first
appeared before the faithful
,above St. Peter's Square after
he was elected pope.
Smiling and clearly moved,
Benedict responded, "Grazie.
Now let us return to prayer" -
his words bringing to an end
the resounding applause that
had grown in intensity over
several minutes.
Then, in a rare gesture and
sign of respect, the rows of bish-
ops, some with tears in their
eyes, removed their mitres. One
prelate dabbed at his eyes with
a handkerchief.
"Viva il papa!" someone in
the crowd shouted as the pope
slowly made his way down
the steps of the altar, assisted
by two clergymen. He then
departed St. Peter's for the last
time aboard a wheeled plat-
form, sparing him the long
walk down the aisle.
Ash Wednesday marks the

start of Lent, the most solemn
season on the church's liturgi-
cal calendar that ends with Holy
Week, when the faithful com-
memorate the death of Christ
and his resurrection on Eas-
ter Sunday. By this Easter, on
March 31, the church will likely
have a new pope.
In his final homily as pontiff,
Benedict sent a clear message
to his successor and those who
will electhim of his hope for the
future: a united church that isn't
"defiled" by internal rivalries.
Each Christian, he said, is
called to bear witness to the
faith. "I think in particular of
the attacks against the unity of
the church, to the divisions in
the ecclesial body," he said.
"ExperiencingLent ina more
intense and evident ecclesial
union, moving beyond individ-
ualisms and rivalries, is a hum-
ble and precious sign for those
who have drifted from the faith
or are indifferent to it."

Carnival disputes
passenger accounts
of conditions
HOUSTON (AP) - Carni-
val Cruise Lines has canceled
a dozen more planned voy-
ages aboard the Triumph and
acknowledged that the crippled
ship had been plagued by other
mechanical problems in 'the
weeks before an engine-room
fire left it powerless in the Gulf
of Mexico.
The company's announce-
ment on Wednesday came as
the Triumph was being towed
to a port in Mobile, Ala., with
more than 4,000 people on
board, some of whom have
complained to relatives that
conditions on the ship are dis-
mal and that they have limited
access to food and bathrooms.
The ship will be idle through
April. Two other cruises were
called off shortly after Sunday's
fire.
Debbi Smedley, a passenger
on a recent Triumph cruise,
said the ship had trouble on
Jan. 28 as it was preparing to
leave Galveston. Hours before
the scheduled departure time,
she received an email from Car-
nival stating the vessel would
leave late because of a propul-
sion problem. Passengers were
asked to arrive at the port at 2
p.m., two hours later than orig-
inally scheduled.
The ship did not sail until
after 8 p.m., she said.
"My mother is a cruise trav-
el agent so this is not my first
rodeo. I have sailed many, many,
cruises, many, many cruise
lines. This was, by far, I have to
say, the worst," said Smedley, of
Plano, Texas.
Robert Giordano, of the
Oklahoma City suburb of
Edmond, said he last spoke to
his wife, Shannon, on Monday.
She told him she waited in line
for three hours to get ahot dog,
and that conditions on the ship
were terrible.
"They're having to urinate
in the shower. They've been
passed out plastic bags to go to
the bathroom," Giordano said.
"There was fecal matter all
over the floor."
Even more distressing, Gior-
dano said, has been the lack of
information he has been able to.
get from Carnival, a complaint

shared by Vivian Tilley, of San
Diego, whose sister is also on
the vessel.
Carnival, she said, has not
told families what hotel passen-
gers, will be put in or provided
precise information about when
they will arrive in Mobile, Ala.
And that came after the cruise
line switched the ship's tow-
ing destination from Progreso,
Mexico, to Mobile.
Tilley said her sister, Renee
Shanar, of Houston, told her the
cabins were hot and smelled
like smoke from the engine fire,
forcing passengers to stay on
the deck. She also said people
were getting sick.
"It's a nightmare," Til-
ley said, noting Shanar and
her husband chose a four-day
cruise so they wouldn't be away
from their two daughters for
too long.
After losing power on its
most recent journey, the ship
drifted until Tuesday, when
two tugboats began moving it
toward shore.
Tilley said late Wednesday
that she had received an update
from Carnival saying the Tri-
umph had again rendezvoused
with another cruise line, taking
on more supplies and food, and
that a third tugboat had also
arrived to bring the ship to port.
Passengers have had lim-
ited cellphone service because
of the power failure, but many,
were able to make calls to
friends and family when the
Triumph rendezvoused with
another Carnival ship that
dropped off food and supplies.
The other ship had a working
cellular antenna.
Meanwhile, officialsinMobile
are preparing a cruise terminal
that has not been used for a year
to help passengers go through
customs after their ordeal.
The Triumph is expected to
arrive Thursday afternoon.
The cruise ship company has
chartered 15 buses to haul pas-
sengers to hotels in New Orleans
and -downtown Mobile, said
Barbara Drummond, a spokes-
woman for the city of Mobile.
Carnival said passengers
would also be able to fly home
on chartered flights.
The company has disputed
the accounts of passengers who
describe the ship as filthy, say-
ing employees are doing every-
thing to ensure people are
comfortable.

Michigan students need a globalized learning experience
 tn a stunning blow to education and diversity, state Rep. Phil
Potvin introduced a bill that would remove foreign language
requirements in high schools earlier this month. Potvin argued
that Michigan's current curriculum standards, which began to include
world languages in graduation requirements in 2010, "forces kids into
frustration," which pushes students to drop out of high school. While
Potvin believes his bill will protect Michigan's students, in reality, his
proposal will do exactly the opposite. If Michigan legislators wish to
keep the state's students competitive in both college admissions and
the job market, they shouldn't pass Potvin's bill. Foreign language must
remain a top priority for educators and students in the state.

I think it just shows that while Americans
are united in their support for the Second
Amendment, it needs to go hand in hand
with keeping guns out of the hands
of dangerous individuals."
- Zach Pohl, executive director of Progress Michigan, said in response to a EPIC-MRA poll conducted last week.
The poll showed that a majority of Michiganders support ban on assault weapons and background checks.

Under the curriculum changes implement-
ed in 2010, Michigan students are required to
take at least two credits of a language other
than English inorder to graduate high school.
While this was a good step in ensuring global
education for Michigan's students, foreign
language classes should be implemented from
an even younger age - which many schools
already offer - and certainly not done away
with all together. Though researchers dis-
agree on the specific time when studying a
foreign language becomes more difficult,
most agree that before puberty is the best
time to learn a new language. The brain plas-
ticity theory argues that the younger the
brain, the more receptive it is to learning a
new language. These studies suggest that
foreign language studies would be more suc-
cessful at younger ages, ensuring that these
classes would no longer be a "frustration," as
Potvin contends.
Many colleges, public and private alike,
require a foreign language when a student
is applying., At the University, for example,
two years of high-school foreign language is
requited for consideration, while four years
are highly recommended by the Office of
Admissions. Often, high-school students don't
begin finalizing future plans until later in
their high-school career, when it's too late to
begin a four-year foreign language require-

ment for an application. By keeping, and even
expanding the foreign language requirement
in Michigan public schools, students would
be more prepared for college when the time
comes. Furthermore, for students who don't
plan on immediately 'entering higher educa-
tion, foreign language skills are critical in the
workforce. According to Euro London, a multi-
lingual recruitment agency, bilingual workers
can expect to earn 10 to 15 percent more than
English-only speakers. Whether it's the U.S.
government or international business, experi-
ence in multiple languages attracts countless
employers, throughout the world. Removing
this requirement in Michigan schools will not
protect Michigan students as Potvin argues;
rather, it will only make them less desirable to
both universities and employers.
The foreign language curriculum in Michi-
gan public schools should be reviewed to make
sure that the classes teach more than vocabu-
lary. Foreign language classes offer students
an opportunity to engage in cultures that don't
otherwise fit into the high school curriculum.
World language educators have an opportunity
to breakstereotypes, and explore identities that
Michigan students may not otherwise experi-
ence. Michigan's current language require-
ments can offer students exposure to different
cultures - and it would be ill-conceived to
remove that opportunity.

she were at
Sava's with the
strappingguy who will never notice
her. There's also a woman going
bananas over a heart-shaped box of
chocolates with a pair of diamond
earrings hidden inside. But the
Valentine's Day dog and pony show
isn't necessarily for everyone.
Asa recovering serial dater, I've
experienced a variety of these cel-
ebrations ranging from the nice to
the terrible. My most memorable
one was when I was 14 and my first
boyfriend pulled out all the stops. He
got me jewelry and chocolates, and
played his own arrangement of "All
the Things You Are" on his trom-
bone, but by the end of the day he
was crying while he rubbed my feet.
I don't remember what triggered his
breakdown - maybe it was the day's
pressure or his deep-seeded oddness
- but I do remember my toes were
wet with tears and that moment set
the tone for my future run-ins with
classic romance.
You could argue that this experi-
ence was a fluke, and if I were with
someone else then the schmaltz of it
all wouldn't have failed me. But that
wasn't the only Valentine's Day I've
had that ended with a cry instead of
a bang, and I've since learned that
the holiday's expectations don't

ever she wanted.
It's possible that people who
believe in the one-fits-all stereo-
types might think the day she
described sounds like a way to
cover up her tragic loneliness with
material goods and eaten feelings.
However, if you've met my friend,
you'd know that she's actually a
super sexy, independent catch who
- despite her mother's incessant
skepticism - has no interest in a
relationship, let alone being pam-
pered by a dude on Valentine's Day.
"I'm excited," she said while -
snacking on a box of crackers in
our kitchen. "I deserve it."
Another friend of mine said she's
also over the world of chocolate
and flowers, and even monoga-
mous sex. "I just want something
casual," she wrote via Facebook
Chat. "Nothing uber-romantic, that
would be soooo uncomfortable."
She's also not alone on this one.
It seems like a lot of women my
age, myself included, aren't only

The Valentine's Day
dog and pony show
isn't necessarily
for everyone.

So, if you're currently in love and
jazzed about the Valentine's Day
you have planned, then that's swell.
If you got the reservations at the
fancy restaurant with the tinfoil
swans, and have 50 bucks' worth
of rose petals in the fridge and
the stars aligned with your period
so you can tear off your partner's
clothes and make sweet, clean love,
that's awesome. Go for it.
Just remember that if a girl is
skipping out on the Valentine's Day
hype, there's a detent chance that
it's her choice. She doesn't need to
be pitied or told it's just another day
on the calendar because you never

time for rewarding her daily hard
work with a shoppingspree and
some casual carnal activity.

Foreign language requirements in public
schools are too restrictive. House Bill 5534,
currently in the Michigan legislature, would
do away with them entirely, shifting educa-
tion focuses to more vocational opportunities.
This legislation is misguided for a number
of reasons. Learning a foreign language has
been shown to have cognitive advantages,
and it exposes students to cultures and basic
college prerequisites. Not only should foreign
language requirements remain in Michigan,
but they should be expanded to include pro-
gramming languages.
Any definition of "language" is likely to
include points on translating signifiers into
signs into symbols (letters and words) that can
be arranged and rearranged by certain rules
(syntax and grammar) to communicate a mes-
sage. Languages are tools of communication.
Were they not adequate mediums of expression,
languages would have begun and ended in the
grunts of our ancestors, never having risen to'
their place amongthe chief accomplishments of
the human race. So engrained in our minds are
the effects of language that we have a hard time
picturing our lives without them - from speak-
ing to, writing, thinking to doing, languages
pervade nearly every aspect of everything we
do. This is entirely true of programming lan-
guages as well.
And yet there is reticence to expanding for-
eign language requirements to include com-
puter languages. Some contend that foreign
language requirements should only extend to
human languages spoken predominantly in
other countries. There are three main argu-
ments to this point: one, learning a language
that's spoken by a large portion of the popula-
tion opens up more possibilities; two, there's a
deeper and more meaningful "cultural" signifi-
cance conferred by spoken human languages;
and three, programming languages are con-
structed and are therefore more "artificial"
than other languages.
Let's consider these points in reverse order.
All human language is human-made and arbi-
trary distinctions made in favor of a preferred
language smack of warrantless elitism. Fur-
thermore, while history does bestow a certain
cultural inertia to many traditional languages,
to automatically dismiss the modes of thinking,
types of expression and social aspects of pro-
gramming misses a significant reason why we
should try to learn second languages. And final-
ly, there are millions of programmers across the
world whose words have global effects; after

all, the Internet is nothingshort of the collected
works of countless coding authors. Program-
ming languages matter.
Eventhe U.S.government agrees.Inhis State
of the Union address, President Barack Obama
reiterated a point that his administration has
stressed time and again: The country is in dire
need of computer scientists, technicians and
engineers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics pre-
dicts that there will be more than two-million
additional jobs requiring computer specializa-
tions by 2020. How will these demands be met
with such a dearth in supply? We need people
who can speak these languages. Without being
able to communicate with professionals in a
field - without understanding how computers,
servers and just about every electronic device
on the planet uses language to operate - there's
quite literally little to be said on the matter. We
simply cannot solve our problems if we don't
know how to convey them.
Beyond the real-world applicability of
learning a programming language as a second
language, there are pedagogical benefits. Pro-
gramming languages have fairly loin barriers to
entry in that one's thoughts can be translated
quite easily from one's primary language. This
easy translation is also coupled with instan-
taneous feedback (whether one's words, logic
and syntax are correct will be checked almost
immediately), removing' the temporal lag in
uncertainty and reducingthe problem of work-
ing bad habits into one's vocabulary. More-
over, creativity can flourish almost as quickly.
Though you may be able to talk about your trip
to the library and how nice the tables at the res-
taurant were after a semester of Spanish, after a
semester of nearly any programming language
a person is equipt to do everything from find-
ing the first million prime numbers to creating
a personal version of Tetris. The fact that com-
puter languages are also uniquely positioned
to take advantage of the recent trends in edu-
cation toward online learning and massively
distributed courses is one that shouldn't escape
educators and legislators alike.
Programming languages are languages.
Their importance is obvious and should be
translated to our nation's students. As our globe
becomes increasingly interconnected, we need
ways of transcending borders. The students of
today must be able to greet this reality in as
many ways as they can.
Barry Belmont is an
Engineering graduate student.

ike most students, I'm a bit
cynical when it comes to
student government. Year
after year we
vote to put our
peers into office,
never to hear
back from them
again. However,
with so many
resources at
their disposal, KEVIN
our elected MERSOL-
representatives BARG
can potentially
serve students
in a way no other student organi-
zation can. The Central Student
Government commands a budget of
more than $700,000 each year and
wields significant influence when
dealing with the University's top
decision-makers.
Historically, it has played a criti-
cal role in everything from holding
University administrators account-
able to funding important programs.
According to a document submit-
ted to the Board of Regents, CSG
investigated University policies as
a community watchdog and in 1978
"spearheaded a student-led refer-
endum to bring (Student Legal Ser-
vices) to campus."And just last year,
CSG helped realize initiatives to
expand access to childcare subsidies
for students with children and install
more water-bottle refill stations
around campus. To achieve this, CSG
provided funds that incentivized
the University to act, which helped
resolve intractable talks between
students and administrators.
Next month, we have an oppor-
tunity to shape the future of CSG
and our University. CSG will hold
elections for offices such as student
body president and representatives.
I encourage prospective candidates
to embrace progressive issues in
their platforms and, if elected, act
on them.,

I call upon them to leave their
mark on the University - to
address issues of accessibility and
campus climate.
More than ever, students are
struggling to meet the cost of a
higher education. Accordingto the
Record Update, students' "tuition
bill ... has gone up an average of 5.56
percent in each of the last 10 years."
In other words: in-state, lower-divi-
sion LSA undergraduate students
in 2002 paid about $7,500 and now
pay nearly $13,000 per year. Tuition
increased dramatically more for
out-of-state students. Of course, stu-
dents must cut checks for more than
tuition - they have to pay for books,
housing and other sundries.
The cost of a university educa-
tion has long been prohibitive for
bright students in Michigan and
beyond. For those of us fortunate
enough to afford it, it poses a great
financial burden - in the form of
student loans - that will haunt us
for decades. CSG has the power to
lobby decision-makers and fund ini-
tiatives that can reduce this burden
to great effect.
And while the state of affirma-
tive action in Michigan remains
in flux, the University needs all
hands on deck to recruit and retain
students from minority communi-
ties. First generation students,
low-income students and students
of color enhance diversity on cam-
pus. Greater diversity on campus
assures greater diversity in other
areas of society, exposing and
sensitizing more people to others
with different identities and experi-
ences. The University plays a key
role in transforming our world for
the better, and, as part of the Uni-
versity, CSG can do this too.
More than just concerns of
accessibility weigh heavy on the
minds of many students on cam-
pus. Another widely held concern
looms: How can we, as a University

community, confront bias incidents
and create a healthy campus cli-
mate? Incidents arise all too often,
such the torn down flyers in Haven
Hall last October. As a nexus of
communities on campus, CSG is
uniquely positioned to provide
a forum for students to dialogue
about bias incidents,.exploring the
underlying issues while creating
safe spaces for minority students.
Student leaders must
go beyond small
projects and promote
ambitious vision.
As a former candidate for student
body president and a student gov-
ernment veteran, I ask this year's
candidates to heed my advice. Look
beyond small tangible projects and
promote an ambitious vision for
what campus life could look like five
or ten years from now. Rather than
campaign on 'making student gov-
ernment relevant,' promote solutions
that are more relevant to students.
Gauging student input is important,
yes, but you should confront issues
proactively because we've already
identified some large ones and
they're becoming worse with time.
As a concerned student, I intend
to support candidates who cham-
pion progressive causes. Of course,
this requires that progressive can-
didates join the race. When eyeing
a run for elective office, consider
ways to tackle social inequities
at the University. Break the mold
traditionally cast for student gov-
ernment. Dare to envision a pro-
gressive future and act on it.

I can't deny the possibility that
someone could do this job more
quickly than I could."
But for Caminker, speed is not
crucial, quality is.
"I think that in everything
I've tried to do here, I've tried to
maintain authenticity and integ-
rity," Caminker said. "There are
lots of splashy ways to pretend
you are doing something new and
different.,I think we try and do
things the right way and for the
right reasons."
Before his appointment,
Caminker served as U.S. Depu-
ty Assistant Attorney General,
clerked for U.S. Supreme Court
Justice William Brennan and prac-
ticed law in public interest and
private firms. After a diverse range
of legal experiences, Caminker
entered education as a faculty
member at Universityof California,
Los Angeles Law School.
In 1999, Caminker joined the
University's Law School faculty
and was later appointed as associ-
ate dean for academic affairs.
In addition to passion for teach-
ing, Caminker said legal study
opens possibilities not available to
those who practice in government
or private sectors.
"I really liked the idea of being
able to select the problems that I
wanted to try and solve, and one
advantage of being a scholar is
you generally have free reign to
figure out what are the problems
in society that really need atten-
tion and how you could you then
go figure out how to best contrib-
ute to a conversation."
Caminker's attention to detail
and pressing issues is a trait that
has permeated most aspects of his
time as dean, including the massive
facilities project of constructing
Aikens Commons and South Hall.
Michele Frasier Wing, the law
school's director of finance and
planning, spent the last three
years working with Caminker
on initiatives such as the build-
ing projects and financial aid
improvements.

"The safety of our passengers is
our highest priority," Etter wrote.
"Any complaints concerning
our service are thoroughly and
promptly investigated. We do not
knowingly tolerate any abusive
or inappropriate conduct on the
part of the drivers who lease our
vehicles."
A female student reported that
on Feb. 3, a taxi driver raped her
/in his cab in a parking lot on the
300 block of East Madison Street.
The suspect in that case is still at
large. He is described as a white
male, in his mid to late 20's with
short brown hair.
In a written statement Wednes-
day, AAPD Det. Lt. Robert
Pfannes acknowledged a third,
earlier assault previously unre-
leased to the media. A 19-year-old

University student alleges that
on Jan. 23, a taxi driver acted
towards her in an unwanted man-
ner after dropping off two other
passengers.
The student alleges that, after
parking, the suspect made "inap-
propriate advances," including
tryingto take off an article of her
clothing. The student reportedly
kicked the driver before exiting
the cab. The suspect in that case is
described as a male with medium
olive complexion.
Pfannes wrote that AAPD is
still investigating the Jan. 23
and Feb. 3 incidents, and are
"exploring the possibility that
the crimes may or may not be
related."

deliberative person, but the thing
that I think stands out the most
for me is that he has a tremendous
amount of integrity in the way he
approaches all of the decisions he
has to make," Frasier Wing said.
"He takes it extraordinarily seri-
ously."
Frasier Wing said Caminker
cares deeply about the student
experience, a characteristic that
may help him as he moves on to
become a member of the school's
faculty. She said he worked
diligently to ensure the largest
expansion to the law school cam-
pus since its construction.
Law School student Elizabeth
Och, president of the school's
senate, said the upgrades have
drastically improved the student
experience.
"The space that has opened up
has completely changed the face
of the law school and a change in a
really positive way - the waythat
students are able to engage with
each other," Och said. "Nobody
really imagines what life was like
before it. It feels like it belongs."
In addition to spearheading
the construction projects, which
continue with renovations to the
Lawyer's Club, Caminker has
ushered University law education
into the 21st century.
While in previous decades
law firms often trained new
hires in firm-specific techniques,
Caminker said most firms are now
looking for graduates to be ready
to begin practice right away.
To prepare graduates for these
demands, Caminker led the effort
to more than triple the number of
clinical programs, which provide
experiential training and allow
students to provide real repre-
sentation to clients under faculty
guidance. Many of the new clin-
ics, which include topics such as
human 'trafficking and environ-
mental law, are housed within the
recently laid stone of South Hall,
visible just outside Caminker's
window.
On a different wall in Camink-
er's office, there's a framed black
portrait of the Supreme Court
in Washington D.C. - another
emblem of Caminker's tenure.
Caminker has organized lectures
by three Supreme Court justices

in his-time here.
The portrait is also representa-
tive of his firstday as dean in 2003
- a day when the U.S. Supreme
Court handed down itsdecision in
Grutter v. Bollinger, the landmark
affirmative action case against
the school. University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman worked
closely with Caminker during the
court proceedings, which eventu-
ally upheld the University's nar-
row use of affirmative action in
race-based decisions.
Och, who has closely worked
with Caminker during her term as
Law School Student Senate presi-
dent, recognizes his ability work
through any problem whether
they are student complaints or new
projects for studentorganizations.
"First and foremost, he's very
thorough," Och said. "He's defi-
nitely always willing to listen to
any sort of complaint or listen to
input on how to solve a project.
He always does his homework to
get the full picture moving for-
ward. He makes sure to involve
lots of different viewpoints in
his decisions, and he's also very
mindful of making decisions that
fit with the spirit of the school and
the character of Michigan Law."
Och remembers sitting next
to Caminker at an event, where,
after speaking to a student about
his interests and law school
experience, he was concerned he
couldn't remember the student's
name. Och said Caminker could
have brushed it off, but he instead
asked her about it so he could put
a face to a name.
Whether he's dancing on a
table to raise money for public-
interest summer programs, or
speaking on a serious topic with
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena
Kagan, Och said students admire
the dean.
And for Caminker, it's all part
of maintaining the culture that
drew him to the University in the'
first place.
"The thing that attracted me
(to the University) was this sense
of community and culture,"
Caminker said. "There was a com-
bination of seriousness of purpose
but a friendliness and playfulness
that I don't think I've ever seen at
any other law school."

TICKETS
From Page 1A
attendance and usage of the
department's H.A.I.L. mobile
application. The department,
which has already distributed its
allotment, will still pay for many
of those tickets, as it has in the
past.
Though most students had
little issue with the policy itself,
many felt misinformed or misled
by the department. Many never
received word from the depart-
ment about the policy shift.
Others took issue with the pol-
icy's enforcement, particularly
with the use of H.A.I.L., which
some fans argued was an ineffec-
tive gauge of loyalty.
"I think it's a really good pol-
icy, and I'm personally in favor,"
said Jason Okrasinski, a Business
senior. "I just assumed that they
would, at some point, email us or
at least just say they're going on
sale, or at least the process, how
it's going to go."
All parties agree that the pol-
icy was unclear until the middle
of the season. Typically, the Ath-
letic Department has paid for
the school's allotment of student
tickets and given them to the
Maize Rage, Michigan's fan sec-
tion, to distribute as it sees fit.
With demand surging and
supply still limited, according to
Associate Athletic Director Dave
Ablauf, the Athletic Depart-
ment's marketing office decided
to alter that policy in the middle
of this season.
"We're now taking over the
administration and distribu-
tion of the ticket in that we're
rewardingthe students who have
the greatest loyalty to the pro-
gram during the season - that's
the difference," Ablauf said. "We
wanted to have at least the over-
sight of it to know that we were
giving it to the students that
showed the most loyalty to the
program throughout the year."
Ablauf said the change was
soon communicated to the Maize

Rage and that a portion of the
tickets still went to the organi-
zation. Sasha Shaffer, vice presi-
dent of the Maize Rage, called
the policy "different" but added:
"We're not mad about it."
Many students not active in
the organization remained in the
dark. The problem was exacer-
bated by an apparent disconnect
between the marketing depart-
ment and the Michigan Ticket
Office.
One student who contacted-
the email address for the Ticket
Office on Jan. 29, for example,
received the following reply from
an unnamed responder: "I have
been told that the Marketing
Team will send an email in the
next week or two to students that
ordered student season tickets.
When you read the email, make
sure you understand the guide-
lines. The email will explain
everything in detail."
The emailnever came, though,
leaving those fans waiting in
vain.
Those who independently
sought out a ticket paid for
their preemptive purchase. Eric
Hutchinson, the Engineering
senior who has missed two home
games overall and just one game
this season, bought student tick-
ets in advance through the Big
Ten website. Though he poten-
tially could have been eligible
for the free ticket offer based on
attendance, he said his purchase
disqualified him. He said he ulti-
mately paid about $65, including
fees, for the student ticket.
The students whg bought tick-
ets early "kind of got screwed
over by that too, showing their
dedication and buying a ticket,"
said Hutchinson, who is a mem-
ber of the Maize Rage core.
"The Athletic Department did
not want to help them out there
because they had already bought
a ticket."
Members of the Maize Rage
and others who did not buy
in advance, and who were not
offered free tickets, were left
scrambling. With less than 100

tickets initially available, and
less after the free tickets were
distributed, only the very early
responders found student tick-
ets.
One member of the Maize
Rage, who wished to remain
anonymous, said that once word
spread, "It was kind of a rush."
He added: "I imagine some
people didn'tgetitiftheyweren't
fast enough, but that's, obviously,
I guess an advantage to having
been at that one meeting."
Another portion of the student
section attended games but rare-
ly checked in with the H.A.I.L.
application.
"I guess I just go to the games
and my phone's in my pocket,"
said Ari Kurzmann, a LSA senior.
"Watching the game I might take
a picture or two, but I'm not real-
ly trying to check out any apps....
I just wish I would've known at
the beginning of the season that
(a Big Ten Tournament ticket)
was on the line because I prob-
ably would've just gone to those
games and checked in."
Added Hutchinson: "I like
the thought to try to get more
people down there, but they gave
the free tickets to people who
had checked into H.A.I.L. every
time, not the people who show
up early, get the front row, orga-
nize the cheers and all that kind
of stuff. The people who really
show dedication to the school
were not rewarded for it."
Some students, like Sam
Gross, the LSA senior who had
looked for tickets along with his
housemates, still said he would
consider attending the tourna-
ment, which will be held at the
United Center in Chicago.
As of Wednesday night,
MGoBlue.com contained a mes-
sage saying that all tickets to the
Big Ten Tournament had sold
out, with a link to StubHub.com,
an online ticket marketplace.
There, a pass for all six sessions
for the tournament started at
$397.00, plus fees, for a ticket in
the upper corner of the United
Center.

to the severance payments, but
Adidas has yet to pay its $1.8 mil-
lion.
The University's chapter of
United Students Against Sweat-
shops hosted the event with the
goal of persuading University
President Mary Sue Coleman to
give Adidas a 90-day notice
to pay the former workers the
severance pay they're owed. If
Coleman leveragesi the Univer-
sity's $60-million contract with
Adidas - the largest collegiate
agreement the company holds -
the group hopes Adidas would be
persuaded to pay up.
Hidayat said during his time
working at the factory from 2001
until the factory's' abrupt clos-
ing, the workers received with
low wages, worked overtime
and were sexually harassed. As
the head of the workers' union,
he said the company threatened
to kill him twice and put him in
jail for four months after he had
attempted to begin discussion
about minimum wage.
In late September, Coleman
wrote a letter to Adidas Ameri-

ca President Patrik Nilsson and
Gregg Nebel, the head of the
company's social and environ-
mental affairs, expressing con-
cern over the treatment of their
former employees. In the letter,
Coleman requested a monthly
report from the company and
assistance to the former employ-
ees.
Heni said Adidas compen-
sated the former employees in
vouchers to a market that did
not supply specific necessities
for her family. Without unem-
ployment benefits, Heni and
Hidayat both said the vouchers
were not effective in alleviating
the hardships of,being without
a job.
"This suffering is not some-
thing made up and not some-
thing manipulative," Heni said.
"This is something that I and my
friends truly experienced. Oth-
ers suffered even more than I
did, and, for this reason, we ask
for your solidarity."
USAS's national organiza-
tion pays for former PT Kizone
employees, including Hidayat
and Heni, to travel the nation to
inform college students of the
situation.
LSA junior Katherine Corbit,

a member of USAS, said Univer-
sity students should take notice
of the issue because Adidas is
the brand displayed on much of
their maize and blue merchan-
dise.
"Think about all the t-shirts
for basketball and for football
with the Adidas logo on it,"
Corbit said. "Students have a
relationship with these workers
because these workers made our
apparel."
Michigan apparel was being
produced when the factory shut
down, meaning that the employ-
ees were not paid specifically
for making University-licensed
clothing.
Concluding the event, Public
Policy senior Abigail Williams,
a member of USAS, said the
University is legally obligated to
demand that Adidas pay the sev-
erances because of the its con-
tract with the company.
"We have a power," Williams
said.
Corbit said Coleman and
members of a University adviso-
ry committee are working with
the company to develop a plan.
She said USAS hopes to meet
with the advisory committee to
talk more about the issue.


said. He said he would like to see
money saved through decrimi-
nalization go toward budget pri-
orities, such as education.
"I think this issue is impor-
tant enough that our political
leaders really ought to put aside
the potential controversy of it,"
Irwin said. "I think we're going
to find out that decriminalizing

marijuana is an excellent first
step that will make our kids safer,
take a whole lot of money and
energyout of the hands of violent
criminals and (will allowi us) to
put more energy inthe issues that
we should be focusing on, includ-
ing education, making college
more accessible and affordable,
and improving our roads."

that fit well into Borges's roles for
the position.
The only spot of potential con-
cern in the class is wide receiv-
er, the lowest-rated position in
Michigan's class. The coaches
signed three receivers - Jaron
Dukes from Ohio and a pair of
in-staters in Da'Mario Jones and
Csont'e York - but most analysts
regarded each as a three-star
recruit.
It's clear the coaches value size
at receiver - each recruit checks
in at 6-foot-2 or taller - but
speed is a question. Wide receiv-
ers coach/recruiting coordina-
tor Jeff Hecklinski downplayed
that aspect of the position, saying
that "speed is overrated" and that
it's difficult to even determine
a recruit's speed since he likely
rarely touches the ball in high
school.
"If you can't catch, we have
issues," Hecklinski said. "All of
our guys, if you watch them on
high-school film, they have great
hands, theyadjust to the ball, they
track the ball very well in the air
and theygo up and they catch it.
"We can judge that on film, so
let's get the best hand-eye coordi-
nation guys, guys that can catch
the football,. let's bring them in
here and let's develop them in
other areas."
Though the coaches assembled
an extremely talented offensive
class, it wasn't necessarily easy.
Borges and his cohorts had to
convince recruits that they'd be
playing in a system they wanted
to play in, which wasn't neces-
sarily the spread-hybrid they saw

times you have to go back and
show them stuff you've done in
the past (at otherschools) because
they got to see what you're getting
to. ... But we showed them, and
they understood, they know what
direction we want to go in, and
that's why they decided to come
here."
With the 2013 class in tow and
Borges closer than ever to his

days of the coach needing to dig
into the film archive for recruit-

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Junior defenseman Mac Bennett sustained an upper-body injury Jan. 8, and Michigan coach Red Berenson said he rushed Bennett back to help the reeling Wolverines.
Bennett gains coach's perspective

Junior defensemen
said he felt helpless
while nursing a
month-long injury
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
In the past month, Mac Ben-
nett discovered a newfound
respect for the Michigan hockey
team's coaching staff.
It dates back to Jan. 8, when
the junior defenseman sustained
an upper-body injury in Michi-
gan's game against Bowling
Green. Since then, Bennett could
do nothing but watch from the
stands as the Wolverines stum-
bled their way through the rest of
January.
It was during this month-long
absence that he gained a new per-
spective on some of the team's
problems.
"If anything, it's frustrating," .
Bennett said. "I'm helpless stand-
ing up there, you want too yell
down to the ice and grab someone
and say, 'Do it this way,' but you
can't do that.
"Now I understand what it

would be like to be a coach ... when
they're trying to getcthrough tous
and tell us to do things certain
ways and we're just not doing it.
It's frustrating to watch."
The bulk of the Wolverines'
injuries this season have been to
their defensemen, so Bennett's
absence on the blue line was a big
enough blow in itself.
But even more worrisome
for the Wolverines was that

everyone's happy. That was kind
of my role while I was out."
Michigan coach Red Berenson
knew this off-ice leadership could
'only do so much. Though Bennett
tried his best to carry the team
off the ice, just being a presence
in the locker room didn't seem to
be enough to get the team back on
track.
"I can tell you through these
last eight games of hell that

had the Wolverines been faring

too little, too late for the Wolver-
ines, who ended up surrendering
13 goals on the weekend.
After Saturday's game, Ben-
nett admitted that though he
had physically recovered, he still

ed to be in order to productively
contribute to the defense. He
said having to take time to think
about his actions as a result of los-
ing muscle memory over the.past

his game.
That's why the upcoming bye

time for Bennett.
"It's coming back," Bennett
said. "I want to get back to the

.to the circle for the Wolverines
(3-1), which may- have found
another ace for their rotation.
Wagner, a 32-game winner
and unanimous Big Ten Pitcher
of the Year in 2012, was expect-
ed to retain her leadership role
this season. But her absence
from practice and Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins' vague
words suggest that the pitcher is
suffering from a health-related
issue.
"We don't really like to talk
about injuries," Hutchins said.
"She just isn't in the lineup yet.
We're hopeful that we'll get her
back in a relatively short period
of time."
Driesenga made the most of
her opportunity, pitching 23
innings on the weekend and
W allowing just three earned runs.
Her efforts were capped by a
complete-game shutout in the
Wolverines' 4-0 blanking of
Samford on Sunday, when Dries-
enga added two hits and an RBI.
"I thought (Driesenga) han-

died it well," Hutchins said.
"She's a fit kid, she's a strong kid.
... The competition isn't going to
get any easier."
Though not as impressive as
Wagner, Driesenga's freshman
year was also solid. In2012, she
made the All-Big Ten first team
as a utility player after splitting
time on and off the mound. Still,
her performance last weekend
demonstrated marked improve-
ment since the successful fresh-
man campaign.
"Sara is definitely better now
than she was at the end of last
season," Hutchins said. "She
still isn't quite where she needs
to be. ... (Driesenga and Wagner)
are both going to pitch for us,
and we'll see where that goes."
But the competition for
playing time is far from over.
Hutchins stressed that they

weeks before Big Ten play will
allow players to earn bigger
spots on the team. Freshman
pitcher Alice Fitzpatrick made
her collegiate debut on Feb. 9
against Florida Atlantic by strik-
ing out a batter in 0.2 innings,
and she will be used more
this weekend. Senior pitcher
Stephanie Speierman also saw
action against the Owls, but was
chased after allowing two runs
- one earned..
Two other starting slots are
up for grabs as well. Before the
season began, Hutchins named
four players who might take
over the vacant first base posi-
tion. Junior Taylor Hasselbach
held the spoton opening day, but
freshman Kelsey Susanna also
saw time by the end of the week-
end. Juniors Nicole Sappingfield
and Lyndsay Doyle have secured

starting roles in the outfield, but
Hutchins said the third position
was still undecided.
Winners of five consecutive
conference titles, Michigan is
still searching for its 2013 iden-
tity. Before the season-opening
tournament in Florida, Hutchins
- who has been a part of the
program since 1983 - claimed
she had no idea how the team
would perform in game situa-
tions. Though the team's week-
end was marred by a close loss
to No. 12 South Florida, she was
pleased with the way the team
was coming together.
"We did play well," Hutchins
said. "If we keep getting runners
on, then there's going to come
that big hit where we do score
and we do get that extra run
across the board that will push
us over and help us win."

WE ON.
The moniker, nothing but irrel-
evant semantics, originated when
someone from the basketball
team stumbled upon Adidas shirts
that bore the phrase - entirely
unrelated to Michigan untilithe
* Wolverines donned the shirts at
Madison Square Garden and won
' the NIT Preseason Tip-Off.
The phrase could've stopped
there, until someone decided to
give the tagline a meaning: When
Everyone Operates N*Sync (you
know, like the boy band).
Michigan would go on to claim
the No.1 ranking, and all was
well, until a tough loss at Indiana
turned into another road loss at
Wisconsin and then spiraled out
of control in East Lansing.
ack Novak was in the
building, enjoying part of
his midseason week off
from his professional team in the
Netherlands.
Walking to and from his seat
nestled inside the student sec-

tion, Novak condescendingly
smiled, waved and even yapped
back at each Izzone member who
screamed obscenities at him. He
didnt just embrace the vulgarity
thrown at him, he invited it.
"I beat you guys all by myself
two years ago," he chirped at a
group of students sitting behind
him before even settling into his
own seat.
The game he was referring P
to, an upset over the Spartans in
2011, cemented Novak's legend in
Michigan history when he went
on a screamingtirade at his team- %
mates in a second-half timeout.
But Tuesday, sitting just a
mere five or six feet from where
he laid out the tongue-lashing,
he watched silently as time and
time again, Michigan coach John r j
Beilein called timeouts, onlyto

Not necessarily a glowing
endorsement.
The issue with effort,
or toughness, or what-
ever you want to call it -
which Tim Hardaway Jr. said has
"been going on for the last couple
of games" - almost necessitated
someone getting in someone's
face.
By all accounts, senior captain
Josh Bartelstein is a great leader,
but did anyone expect him to
turn in a Novak-esque moment on
Tuesday night?
Hardaway and Burke, both
hard workers who lead by exam-

ple, probably aren't the type to -
either.
And is there anyone on this
year's squad with enough guts to
return to the Breslin Center in
two years and smuglytaunt the
Izzone?
Michigan doesn't have a
tough-as-nails leader like Novak,
and now it's becoming more of a
stretch to even call the Wolver-
ines anything other than timid
and soft when they're onthe road.
Michigan earned the No.1
ranking based on its talent, now
it'll have to earn its respect back
with something more than skill,
talent on paper or off-the-court
hype.
"We've got to look at ourselves

and ask how much we really want
it," Morgan said. "We want to
win championships, we say that
everyday, but at the end of the day,
we've got to make a commitment
to do our job.
"It's going to come down to just
makinga decision how good we
want to be."
Right now, theyoff. The Wol-
verines have the talent to get back
ON, but do they have the tough-
ness?
That question is worth a lot
more than the price of those
t-shirts.

The King croons on in A2

India's awards

Elvis impersonator
to perform on
Valentine's Day
By ANDREW ECKHOUS
Daily Arts Writer
"I sound 85 percent like (Elvis),
but if somebody's been drinking,
it's 95 percent."
And he's right. When I sat
down with 70-year-old David
Joseph - the Elvis aficionado in
question - in the University Hos-
pital's lobby, he gave me a short
preview of what to expect from
one of his performances.
Softly crooning lines from
"Memories," his favorite Elvis
song, Joseph transformed. His
voice quivered as he emulated his
icon, encapsulating, well, about
85 percent of what made "The
King's" baritone so distinctive.
Joseph's velvety tone ain't quite
as deep as Presley's, but it was
pretty damned impressive none-
theless.
Joseph has been an Elvis Trib-
ute Artist (or ETA, for you pro-
fessionals out there) since two
decades before most current col-
lege students were born. He has
played music since he was 13, and
has been part of a few bands, but
it wasn't until 1972 that he began
his rhinestone-encrusted hobby.
Joseph had watched local Elvis
Tribute Artists for a few years,
and decided to give it a go at the
Bell Bar in Ypsilanti, one of his
favorite hangouts.
"It was scary, but it went
alright," said Joseph of his first
time performing. "It felt good;
the audience liked it; the people
in the bar liked it. I felt good since
I sound a little bit like Elvis, so it
went pretty good, you know."
A little bit is an understate-
ment. But Joseph radiates mod-
esty. Contrary to the ostentatious
decadence of Presley, Joseph
speaks relatively quietly and was
dressed simply when we met.
Aside from the Graceland hat on
his head, you'd never know that
Joseph moonlights as an enter-
tainer, though he has slowed
down recently.
Joseph was born as the eighth
child in a family with 16, and
works part-time as a stock keeper
in the very same hospital where
we spoke. Joseph has lived his
entire life in Washtenaw County,
and has been a part of the Univer-
sity of Michigan Health System
for about 30 years. He always
loved' Elvis, and as a kid, he had
a hunch that they sounded alike.
Eventually, he decided to test out
his theory.
"With a tape recorder, I would
have an Elvis record playing, then
I would sing into the tape record-
er. Then the tape recorder would

Through the years, David Joseph has found peace and relaxation through listening to Elvis's music.

pick us both up and we sounded
pretty good, as a duo."
Elvis has helped Joseph
through some daunting times as
well. Joseph joined the Navy as a
young man, and was stationed in
Guantanamo Bay during the 1962
Cuban Missile Crisis.
"We thought Castro was going
to incinerate us," Joseph recount-
ed. "We were scared; we were out
there on the base, (and) every-
body did their own thing, what-
ever comforted them."
For Joseph, that was play-
ing Elvis songs on his guitar. It
helped him relax in the face of a
situation with seemingly life or
death implications. In his post-
service life, Elvis's tunes have
played a therapeutic role as well.
"It's therapy for me; some
people do other stuff for thera-
py, but this, it just relaxes me -
makes me feel good, and I know
people enjoy it because they're
singing along with me," Joseph
said. "It's just fun."
It might be "just fun" for him,
but for others, it can be mean-
ingful. He performs in nursing
homes and Veterans of Foreign
Wars halls, and his Valentine's
Day performance will be in the
lobby of the University Hospital
starting at 12 p.m. He especially
likes to sing the song "Teddy
Bear" at his performances,
because it gives him a chance to
do something kind for his audi-
ence.
"Elvis had a song called 'Teddy
Bear,' and after he recorded
that - his first birthday after he
recorded that - he got thousands
of teddy bears in the mail. So now
whenI singthat, my granddaugh-
ters hand out teddy bears to the
audience, to the kids. That's why
I went to all the different depart-
ments and told the nurses that
the kids can come down (for this
show)."

Karma has reimbursed Joseph
for his charity work. He's made a
pretty decent second income for
his performances and he even
won a Minor League Baseball
contest that flew him out to Las
Vegas for an Elvis-themed festi-
val.
Joseph has an unparalleled
knowledge of all-things Presley,
leaving little wonder as to why
he's been so successful at imper-
sonating The King. While the
official numbers vary, Joseph
claims that there are about 748
Elvis singles, and that he knows
"about 600 of them." Joseph
never stops improving his tech-
nique though, even after over
half a century of playing Elvis
songs.
"Each time you learn more,
and by watching other people,
you can learn a little bit more,
too."
As much as Joseph reveres
Presley's music, though, he
wants no part of Elvis's drug-
filled life.
"I think that before he got into
all the drugs and stuff, he was
great," Joseph emphasized. "If
you looked at him in 1969, he was
in tip-top shape, but at his last
concert his face was all bloated.
He couldn't pronounce his words
because he was so drugged up."
Our conversation became seri-
ous as Joseph addressed the all-
too-familiar lifestyle of Presley
and his other musical heroes. His
easygoing mannerisms hardened
a bit, and his speech became
more deliberate.
"It makes me mad that he did
that. It makes me mad that Jimi
Hendrix did that. Michael Jack-
son, too," said Joseph. "I've had
a chance to go on the road, but
I didn't want to. I never wanted
to; I didn't want that kind of life.
I never wanted to do it because
I've seen what happened to

them."
Joseph prefers to think about
the good Elvis - the admira-
ble Elvis that treated everyone
equally in a time of suffocating
segregation; the goofy Elvis that,
upon trying his first-ever fried
peanut butter and banana sand-
wich, bought the maid who fried
it a brand-new Cadillac. And
the charitable Elvis who raised
$75,000 for cancer research at
his "Aloha from Hawaii" concert
following the death of a friend.
Joseph has profited both eco-
nomically and in life experience
from his three decades as an
Elvis impersonator. He's made
a lot of friends, sang almost as
many Elvis songs as Elvis him-
self and has even wooed a few
Elvis fans of the fairer sex.
"You ain't kidding," Joseph
laughed. "When you're in a bar
or something, some lady's gonna
try it just like you're gonna try it
if you're in a band."
When Joseph performs at
the University Hospital, he'll be
singing Elvis's romance songs to
celebrate Valentine's Day, and
his own romance is goingastrong.
He's happily married to a woman
who loves his unique pastime,
telling me that "she gets mad if I
don't do it every once in a while."
She even participates in the glitz
and glamour of it all, as she hand-
makes all of his costumes.
The stereotypes about celeb-
rity impersonators generally
revolve around desperate artists
vying for money and hungry for
attention, but those tropes sim-
ply don't apply to Joseph. He
doesn't crave the spotlight; he
just enjoys making others feel
better. While Elvis might have
left the building, David Joseph
still hangs around, and maybe,
if you have just a few drinks too
many, you might be lucky enough
to confuse the two.

DIRTY DETROIT
From Page 1B
Her name in Renee, and she is
at The Dirty Show for a field trip.
"I'm in a graphic design
class," she says, "And I'm try-
ing to compare the pictures and
kind of pick the artists they most
emulate. It's a new feel for me,
but, yeah, it's awesome."
The trend of artists comparing
and contrasting their work with
the ones on display is prevalent.
A palpable sense of community
pervades, and every artist seems
to know each other; they come
to support their friends and to
see what the erotic art "world"
is up to.
Butch's "seduction" doesn't
come to fruition, but, unde-
terred, he continues to call over
every half-naked girl within 15
feet. But here's the thing: The
Dirty Show isn't a bunch of
swingers seeking a one-night-
stand. Instead, couples are the
most common sight. Holding
hands, they gaze at what could
be blush-inducing material.
Could The Dirty Show be the
ultimate Valentine's Day delti-
nation?
I pose the question to Reed, as
she leads me toward the "inter-
active" parts of the show.
"Every year, this is my Valen-
tine's date," Reed declares. "Do
you want to do the cheesy thing
and buy your girlfriend or your
wife chocolate? Not really. For a
lot of people, the art and the show
is a turn-on. Seeing all the peo-
ple and the art," - a ripped man
wearing nothing but a kilt strides
past us, Reed gestures toward him
- "The human form ... it's a great
non-traditional Valentine's date."
As we pass a whirling pole
dancer, Reed describes the
activities from years past: the
aforementioned vibrating merry-
go-round (which was assembled
awkwardly in Reed's garage) and
the "spank rock," on which par-
ticipants could bend over and
receive a spanking. This year, The
Dirty Show has a green screen
(Take a picture of yourself sitting
on a giant penis!) and something
called "Titties and Clitties." Awe-

'RUNAWAY BRIDE' (1999), PARAMOUNT
'Runaway 'success
or shallow flop?

Daily Arts Writers Natalie
Gadbois and Carly Keyes
step into the salon for a
friendly debate on
"Runaway Bride."

The Dirty Show is North America's largest erotic art exhibit.

somely rhymed name aside, the
activity itself is playful enough:
Ladies paint the front of their
nakedbods, then they press them-
selves against a canvas. "Titties
and Clitties," get it?
Loud thumping bass starts up,
and the shows begin.
"Everywhere you look, there's
something to look at," Reed says.
"It's a celebration of sexuality,
the human form and being able to
come out and express yourself."
A male stripper, or maybe an
erotic dancer (funny that I'm try-
ing to be politically correct, here
of all-places) takes the stage. He
rips off his golden thong and cov-
ers himself with a bowler hat. The
ladies cheer. Roxi D'iite, "The
Bad Girl of Burlesque," is one of
the next performers, strutting
and swaying, delicately removing
her white garments. A graceful
flamenco dance, a busty lip-sync
- the acts are endlessly enter-

taining, but my eyes are drawn
toward two girls dancing in the
cages above me. One is dressed in
a sailor-like outfit, the other has
a horsewhip, and they both seem
lost in their own little worlds.
But, in a moment, they stop danc-
ing and glance at each other. The
sailor giggles and starts to thrust.
Openly laughing,they both gyrate
their hips, each toward the other.
A man comes with a ladder, and
lets them down from the cages.
They link arms and start skipping
away, still giggling.
It's this strange tenderness and
vulnerability laced with blatant
sexuality that makes The Dirty
Show special. Shame of the body
- of desire - is challenged and
laughed at by drag queens, stu-
dents, married couples, people
- "normal" or otherwise. Every-
one belongs here, because no
one seems above it all; we're all
human, so why not celebrate that?

This DecemberLa Dolce Vita will have been in Ann Arbor for 15 years.

MARLENE LACASSE/Daily

All of the buns, cakes and pastries sold at Eastern Accents are homemade daily.
Eastern Accents
offers novel treats

Decadent La Dolce Vita

Owners Ben and
Carol Sun present
new flavors
By NATHAN WOOD
Daily Food Columnist
Hand-crafted Asian pastries
is the name of the game at East-
ern Accents. Claiming to be the
first Asian bakery in Ann Arbor,
this joint specializes in those
desserts you would normally
expect to find only in China-
town.
"Ben and Carol Sun found-
ed Eastern Accents 17 years
ago," said longtime employee
Charles Lindsay. "(He) grew up
in China, and has always loved
baking."
Lindsay explained how, after
mastering his family's tradi-.
tional pastry recipes, Ben Sun
moved to Boston to pursue a tra-
ditional patisserie education. It
wasn't long after that the young
baker met Carol, a University
grad. The couple married and
opened Eastern Accents.

"To this day, Ben comes in
every morning at 3 a.m. to start
baking," Lindsay said. "Every-
thing here - all of our buns,
cakes and pastries - are made
daily."
The bakery itself looks a lot
like a coffee shop: There are
small tables and chairs scat-
tered about. People sit near the
front windows sipping hot bev-
erages, lackadaisically typing
on MacBooks and periodically
pausing to watch jaywalking
pedestrians.
One wall is covered with
an Asian-inspired painting of
mountains and flowers, Anoth-
er sets the backdrop for a comi-
cally snall electric fireplace.
The space is cozy and relaxed
- just the spot for a fresh-baked
good to go along with a warm
cup of tea.
For your sweet tooth, there's
the red bean moon cake - a
dense, chewy cake surround-
ing a thick and grainy red bean
paste. The Asian-style cakes,
which aren't as sweet as you
might expect, are. made with
fluffy frosting spread thinly

upon two layers of sponge cake
stuffed with whipped cream
and fruit.
The sesame balls are also
exceptionally scrumptious.
Spootfuls of tacky rice flour
dough are fried and artfully
dotted with crunchy seeds.
These greasy and thick, gum-
my-sweet treats would make
an ideal mid-afternoon metabo-
lism boost and, of course, are
easy on the taste buds, too.
Other dim sum favorites
include the egg tarts, mango
pudding - a big seller at East-
ern Accents - and sweet cream
buns. Everything is authentic
and - best of all - homemade.
So whether you're craving
hard-to-find Chinatown good-
ies, looking for something a
little different for dessert or
are just bored with the clich6 of
chocolates for Valentine's Day,
there's something for you at
Eastern Accents.
Lindsay sums itup best:"This
is a great place for an afternoon
dessert, a hot spot for a couple
who wants a quiet corner in the
heart of Ann Arbor."

Dim mood lighting and cozy
love seats welcome visitors to La
Dolce Vita - one of Ann Arbor's
few purely dessert eateries. The
menu, though admittedly short
and selective, offers diners a
choice of perfectly executed clas-
sic sweets.
La Dolce Vita, along with
its neighbor and adjoining res-
taurant The Chop House, will
have been in Ann Arbor for 15
years in December. In that time,
explained District Manager of
Mainstreet Ventures Sue Burke,
price hasn't deterred people from
making the restaurant a must-
visit destination for an occasion
or happening.
