2014 game will

After 2014, it may be a while
before Michigan and Notre Dame
face each other in football.
Notre Dame will opt out of its
scheduled games with Michigan
beginning in 2014, the Michigan
Athletic Department announced
Tuesday. The three games
planned, between the two teams
from 2015-17 will not be played.
The teams were already planning
to take a two-year break begin-
ning in 2018.
Notre Dame Athletic Director
Jack Swarbrick informed Michi-
gan that the school was pulling

out of the series in a letter deliv-
ered to.Michigan Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon before the
Michigan-Notre Dame game last
Saturday, according to the Associ-
ated Press, which received a copy
of the letter through the Free-
dom of Information Act. Brandon
released a statement Tuesday
after the initial report.
"The decision to cancel games
in 2015-17 was Notre Dame's and
not ours," Brandon said in the
statement. "We value our annual
rivalry with Notre Dame but will
have to see what the future holds
for any continuation of the series.
This cancellation presents new
scheduling opportunities for our
program and provides a chance to
create some new rivalries."
Earlier this month, Notre Dame
announced that all of its sports,
except football and hockey, will
move to compete in the ACC. As
part of the agreement, the Fight-

Brill, the chair

College Democrats have expe-

She said the swell in numbers
is especially visible at mass

ing that the first meeting was
standing room only.
Though this semester has
seen a significant increase in
participation, Brill added that
the increase is still less than in

LOCAL BUSINESSES
Former Fifth
Ave. club to be
converted into
office space

Fifth Quarter
will become new
headquarters of
local realtors
By LIANA ROSENBLOOM
Daily StaffReporter
After years of ongoing legal
issues that led to the subsequent
close of Fifth Quarter nightclub,
the building located at 210 S.
Fifth Avenue will soon become
home to the offices of the oxford
Companies, a local property
management company.
The 12,000-square-foot build-
ingiscurrentlyundergoingmajor
renovations to convert the for-
mer nightclub into office space,
according to Deborah Pearson,
the director of leasing and sales
for Oxford Companies.
"The building's been gutted
and we've put windows in on the
first floor," Pearson said. "The

whole first floor has alot of light
and looks like a new space."
The furnishings of the corpo-
rate offices are still in the works,
but Pearson said the company -
which bought Arch Realty Com-
pany in May - should be able to
move in no later than Jan. 1. The
office space on the second floor
will serve as the home to both
companies.
"The idea was to both buy the
building and be able to put our
whole company together there,"
Pearson said. "We're goingto put
Arch and Oxford in that building
so we will all be under one roof,
and that's the plan for the entire
second floor of the building and
part of the first floor."
Oxford Companies currently
operates outof 312 S. State St. and
Arch Realty Company is located
at 616 Church St. With the addi-
tion of the old Fifth Quarter

The Central Student Gov-

effectively end several years

of attendance and speeches by
an anti-Israel group at assem-

For a number of years, Ann
Arbor resident Blaine Cole-

the School of Public Health,
and other activists have con-
sistently spoke during the

of the weekly assembly meet-

often expressing anti-Israel

assembly before, a resolution
introduced Tuesday would
give non-University stu-

NEWS BRIEFS
MIDLAN
Man guilty of
selling Asian carp
in Michigan
An Arkansas man who authori-
ties say sold live Asian carp in
Michigan has pleaded guilty in
the case.
The Michigan attorney gener-
al's office says 42-year-old David
Shane 'Costner of Harrisburg,
Ark., entered the plea Monday
in Circuit Court in Midland to a
dozen felony charges. Each carries
a maximum.sentence of two years
in prison and a fine of $2,000 to
$20,000. Sentencing is scheduled
for Nov. 1.
A message seeking comment
was left Tuesday with defense
lawyer David Burgess.
Authorities say Costner sold
two grass carp this year in Mid-
land to undercover officers from
the state Department of Natu-
ral Resources. Investigators say
he had been driving around the
southern part of the state selling
the carp from store parking lots
for use in ponds, where they eat
nuisance plants.
NEW YORK CITY
NYC dispenses
morning-after pill
at high schools
It's a campaign believed to be
unprecedented in its size and
aggressiveness: New York City is
dispensing the morning-after pill
to girls as young as 14 at more than
50 public high schools, sometimes
even before they have had sex.
The effort to combat teen preg-
nancy in the nation's largest city
contrasts sharply with the views
of politicians and school systems
in more conservative parts of the
country.
Valerie Huber, president of
the National Abstinence Educa-
tion Association in Wishington,
calls it "a terrible case once again
of bigotry of lowexpectations"
- presuming that teen girls will
have sex anyway, and effectively
endorsing that.
TEL AVIV
Iconic Israeli
newspaper on the
verge of collapse
An Throughout much of Isra-
el's history, the Maariv daily was
known as the "country's paper,"
the newspaper with the highest
circulation and a cornerstone of
Israeli media. Now it is on its last
legs - the victim, some say, of a
Jewish-American billionaire who
is a close friend of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson
launched his free "Israel Hayom"
or "Israel Today" daily five years
ago. The tabloid has steadily gob-
bled up market share since then.
Handed out by ubiquitous distrib-

utors clad in red overalls at busy
intersections, it has become the
most read newspaper in Israel.
The 64-year-old Maariv has
suffered in the fallout. The news-
paper was sold this month by
its cash-strapped owner to a
rival publisher. Most of its 2,000
employees are facing likely dis-
missals.
MEXICO CITY
Government split

A proposal to reform Mexico's
dysfunctional, 1970s-era labor
laws, loosen work rules and
increase union democracy split
Mexican political parties Tues-
day, threatening to create the first
big political battle for President-
elect Enrique Pena Nieto.
Advocates say the reform,
which will allow part-time work,
hourly wages and outsourcing,
will help Mexico create the mil-
lion new jobs per year it needs
for young people and migrants
returning from the United States.
The bill weakens seniority pro-
visions, and leaves unchanged

NOTRE DAME
From Page 1A
ing Irish football team will play
five games annually against
ACC opponents.
"While this move is a nec-
essary precaution as we begin
the process of meeting our
new scheduling commitment
to the ACC," Swarbrick wrote,
according to the AP. "please
know that Notre Dame very
much values its relationship
with Michigan we look forward
to working with you to ensure
that our great football rivalry
can continue."
Notre Dame's recent tran-
sition to the ACC brought the
possibility of a halt in the Fight-
ing Irish's scheduling with the
Big Ten in favor of scheduling
ACC opponents, but the timing
of the announcement came as a
surprise to fans and the Michi-
gan football program alike.
"Well, they've got to do

what's right for Notre Dame,"
said Michigan coach Brady
Hoke. "Obviously we enjoy and
cherish the rivalry because
there's so much history there.
But we'll move forward."
Michigan owns a 23-16-i
advantage in theseries. Notre
Dame's first-ever football game
was played against Michigan in
1887. The two programs have
played regularly since 1978, but
have taken breaks during that
period, most recently a two-
year hiatus in 2000 and 2001.
"It's unbelievable," said
fifth-year senior right guard
Patrick Omameh. "It's a long-
standing rivalry, it's ateam that
we always look forward to play.
It's a team that we would have
enjoyed to keep on our sched-
ule."
Michigan will still play the
Fighting Irish at home on Sept.
7, 2013 and in South Bend on
Sept. 6, 2014. It hasn't been
determined whether the series
will continue in 2020.

cial properties, in addition to
Arch Realty Company's residen-
tial properties.
The remaining space in the
building, about 4,500-square-
feet, will be leased out for office
use, Pearson said.
According to a report by
Swisher Commercial - a Washt-
enaw County commercial real
estate firm - the total market
vacancy rate for office space
decreased by approximately
1.84 percent in the past year.
In addition, leasing demands
increased in 2011, making the
property increasingly attractive.
The company will use the
move as an opportunity to unite
the company, and its new sub-
sidiary, under one roof in hopes
of bringing life to the vacant
building.
Tom Hackett, the owner of

the nearby Afternoon Delight
restaurant, said he is excited
about the change in the build-
ing's tenants.
"They're very good about
keeping things quiet during the
day," Hackett said. "We like hav-
ing offices there. It's better than
having Fifth Quarter nightclub
there."
Pearson said Oxford Com-
panies - which also owns East
Liberty Plaza at East Liberty
Street and Fifth Avenue and the
building in which Afternoon
Delight is located - hopes to
improve the overall aesthetics of
the property.
"One of the reasons the parcel
was attractive to us was that we
already own that other parcel
on the block," Pearson said. "By
buying this building, we now
have that whole segment of the
block. We're investigating what
other kinds of ways to use that
whole piece of property for the
future."

"(Rovell has more than)
200,000 followers on Twitter,
and when he tweeted us out,
that was when everything real-
ly started falling into place,"
Rhodes said. "I would start get-
ting over 20 e-mails a day from
people who wanted to come to
the event and help us out."
Once the MSBC committee
was able to recruit more speak-
ers, they chose a theme for this
year's conference - the chang-
ing face ofsports. The group also
created four speaker panels rep-
resentative of various aspects of
sports business, including the
changing revenue model of col-
lege sports, media reach within
the world of sports, advertising
and sponsorship of sports, and
the branding of anchors.
Cairo said his main goal
in creating the panels was
to ensure that each attendee
would have a meaningful expe-
rience at the conference.
"For freshmen and sopho-
mores, besides the network-
ing aspect, a lot of this will be
helping them figure out what
it is they want to do," Cairo
said. "We thought that these
four panel topics would help do
that."
eager to participate and continue
their efforts even after Election
Day.
LSA freshman Jeff Iles said
he joined the College Democrats
after attending the group's first
mass meeting, though he just
recently considered himself, a
Democrat.
"It's a really great time to get
involved, especially with the
election coming up in just over
a month," Iles said. "Previously
I have not considered myself to
be affiliated with the Democratic
Party, but with how the political
world is right now ... I am defi-
nitely more of a Democrat."
Iles added that he hopes Jo
continue to work'with the Co[
lege Democrats as well as pal-
ticipate in other political events
outside of the University.
Mikatarian, the new member
of the College Republicans, said
she has had a good experience
with the College Republicans
and wants to remain a member
for the rest of her college career.
"I really hope to (keep par-
ticipating). So far, I've liked the

enjoyable, so I plan on staying

er, and had to be gaveled down
when her time expired.
"By trying to silence the
only voices who bring these
atrocities to you ... you are doing
nobody any favors," Savabieas-
fahani said. "By callously ignor-
ing lives of Palestinians, you are
allowing huge injustices to go
on. I hold you responsible for
the death of many thousands of
people."
Coleman didn't receive any
warnings, but he was harsher in
his judgment of the assembly.
"Everyone who raises their
hand to silence the talk of Pal-
estine in this chamber is a
racist who hates Palestinians,
hates Arabs, hates Muslims and
will be announcing themselves
as such," Coleman said.
In his explanation oft the
resolution to the assembly,
Andrew Modell, an Engineer-
ing sophomore and the rules
committee vice chair, said
the current open door policy
on speakers is a hindrance to
meeting operations and its rep-
resentation of the student body.
"A majority of community
concerns that we hear are not
necessarily from the students ...
and often times we have heard
the same message over and
over and over," Modell said.
"While we do want to be able
hear from those who aren't stu-
dents we really don't want that
to be our priority."
Law School representative
Jeremy Keeney said non-stu-
dents can still apply to speak
during the guest speakers por-
tion of assembly meetings.
"What we tried to do is we
tried to balance the concerns
of people in the community as
well as recognizing that our

time is precious," he said.
During the assembly's mat-
ters arising section - a part of
the agenda where CSG mem-
bers can speak on issues they're
working on - members heard
significant discussion from
both supporters and opponents
of the resolution.
LSA sophomore and repre-
sentative Daniel Morales said
he did not approve of or agree
with the Coleman and Sava-
bieasfahani's speeches, but
added that the resolution could
become a "gag rule."
Discussion continued until
Rackham representative Pat-
rick O'Mahen redirected the
assembly to focus more on per-
sonal reports from representa-
tives rather than instigating
debate.
He added that while he has
not decided how he will vote
on the resolution, the debate
was not as inflammatory as he
anticipated.
LSA senior Arielle Zupmore,
a co-author of the resolution,
said in an interview after the
meeting that while Coleman
and Savabieasfahani's consis-
tent attendance at assembly
meetings prompted the resolu-
tion, the resolution was drawn
up to have a broader purpose.
During the matters aris-
ing section, Zupmore said she
and other assembly members
have felt uncomfortable when
Coleman and Savabieasfahani
speak.
"When speakers like that
come and say really negative
things, it's great that they come
once and say that, but every
week I'm sitting in my seat,
cringing," Zupmore said. "I
had to walk out one week, and
I don't want have to walk out
every week. I'm supposed to be
listening to the concerns of our
students."
Zupmore added, however,
that she would not be against
any student who would like to
discuss the issue of divestment
from Israel at meetingsbecause
the assembly has a responsibil-
ity to listen to its constituents.
Modell said in an interview
after the meeting that while
community members would be
able to speak on issues relevant
to the meeting under the pro-
posed resolution, there are no
plans to incorporate language
into the resolution that would
require the agenda to be made
publicly available online before
the meeting.

were turned away due to lack of
space in the meeting room.
Brill said the increase of new
members has enhanced the
group's campaigning efforts,
such as canvassing and phone
banks.
"Normally we'll make a cou-
ple hundred calls (during phone
banks), maybe 400, but we had
so many people (at last Friday's
phone bank), and so many people
who stayed longer than ten or
20 minutes, that we made 2,000
calls in five hours," Brill said.
The Colleg Republicans have
experienced a similar accumula-
tion of membership and enthu-
siasm, despite recent efforts
to impeach their chair Rachel
Jankowski, according to Ross
sophomore Elena Brennan, vice-
external chair of the College
Republicans.
Brennan said the efforts to
remove Jankowski, which ulti-
mately failed after the Central
Student Judiciary ruled last week
that Jankowski can uphold her
position - has not affected stu-
dents' interest in joining the club.

She added that participation usu-
ally increases any time there is a
major election, either locally or
nationally, noting that member-
ship has doubled this semester.
"People are eager to get
involved in what they see as their
future," Brennan said. "This is
the most important election in
our lifetime and I think a lot of
students are recognizing that."
Brennan added that there is
a new sense of unity in the club
after the trial, which will help
new members assimilate.
"Now that (the trial) is over
we're ready to work together and
we're actually stronger because
of it," Brennan said."We learned..
l sht about reach other and we
learned to work with each other
and I think members will see
that and appreciate it and be even
more willing to join."
Brennan said new members
are getting involved in making
calls, door-to-door canvassing
and organizingthe College Truth
Tour - featuring former presi-
dential candidate Herman Cain
- which will make a stop at the
University on Thursday.
Despite the influx of members
due to the upcoming election,

Brigham Young University came

Thomas Kinnear, the execu-

He noted that students work

With the Institute's support,
Business graduate student Josh

of the program, Smith gained

Monday.
"We commend each of these

STEM Jobs Act is a step in the right direction
ays before Congress prepares for recess, lawmakers failed
to pass a bill for further immigration reform. Introduced by
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), the Science, Technology, Engi-
tleering, Math Jobs Act would increase green cards for highly skilled
foreign nationals. While this bill begins the conversation on immigra-
tion reform, it only scratches the surface of the comprehensive immi-
gration reform that lawmakers should discuss. Congress should make
immigration reform a top priority, and while the STEM Jobs Act is a
step in the right direction, more provisions are needed so graduates of all
subjects, and their respected families, are able to live in the United States.

V oter identification laws
are back in the news, and
many of these laws directly
affect college
students. A
new Tennessee
law "explicitly
excludes stu-
dent IDs" as
a valid photo
ID to show at
polls, and Wis- MICHAEL
consin college SPAETH
students can't
use "university-
provided hous-
ing lists or corroboration from other
students to verify their residence."
Republicans in state legislatures
around the country claim that the
new voter ID laws are designed to
combat voter fraud. Now, I could
understand why we should have a
national conversation about pre-
venting voter fraud if it really was
a widespread problem. However,
one recent analysis of election
fraud cases found that since 2000,
there have only been 10 cases of
voter impersonation - out of 146
million registered voters in the
United States. Prof. David Schultz
of the Hamline University School
of Business concluded, "There is
absolutely no evidence that (voter
impersonation fraud) has affected
the outcome of any election in the
United States, at least any recent
election in the United States."
Democrats and other critics have
been up in arms about the new
voter ID laws, claiming that Repub-
licans are trying to reduce voter
turnout among groups that tend
to vote for Democratic candidates,
including minority groups and col-
lege students. On Saturday, First
Lady Michelle Obama went so far
as to call the fight to ensure voting
rights the "sit-in of our day." If some
Republican legislatures are deliber-
ately making voting more difficult

for specific groups of people for
purely political reasons - which
seems likely in many states since
there have been so few cases of
voter fraud - then these actions are
reprehensible and unacceptable.
But while Democrats' claims might
be true about some Republicans,
we should be a little more cautious
before we over-generalize.
Some Republican students at the
University fully support implement-
ing the new voter ID laws but also
believe that states and universities
can do more to provide assistance to
the groups of people that are being
adversely affected by these laws.
"I think that Michigan could pass
a law that says the universities across
the state need to help students navi-
gate the process, help students know
what the laws are, how they can reg-
ister to vote, where they go to get
their proper credentials," said Jared
Boot, an LSA senior and a member of
the College Republicans.
The use of student IDs as photo
identification at polls is another
legitimate topic for consideration.
Pulling out his MCard, LSA senior
and College Republicans senior advi-
sor Brian Koziara pointed out that
there are "no security features to
speak of." Therefore, the Tennessee
law may have some validity if stu-
dent ID's in Tennessee are similar
to ours. At the same time, however,
it's perfectly legitimate for students
in Wisconsin to use official housing
lists from universities as verifica-
tions of their residences, since they
live in these residence halls.
"We need to establish these rig-
orous (voter ID) laws and we need
to make sure that we're protect-
ing the integrity of the ballot box,"
Koziara sa4tl, "but if we're going to
do that, we have to make sure that
we're not preventing people who
should be able to vote and who are
eligible to vote from actually voting."
It's as reasonable for poll workers

to ask voters for their photo ID as it
is for receptionists to ask people for
their photo ID in all kinds of mun-
dane situations. But all states have
to strike a proper balance. If states
are going to make voting slightly
more inconvenient for groups of peo-
ple that are legally allowed to vote
but may not have the means to adapt
to the new voting requirements, they
need to provide extra assistance,
such as transportation to places that
provide the required ID or paper-
work or more accessible information
on the proper voting process. If states
can't give these voters adequate
assistance, they should make their
voter ID laws less stringent or elimi-
nate them altogether.
Existing voter ID
laws are unfair to
college students.

The STEM Jobs Act was introduced this
month after failing many times in many
forms, and would allocate visas to interna-
tional graduates of American universities
with a master's or doctoral degrees in certain
subjects. The recipients of these green cards
would then be able to live in the United States
for five years. This bill would replace the cur-
rent immigration system, in which a lottery
is used to award visas on a per-country basis.
Opponents argue that Republicans are being
too choosy in who they allow to live in the
United States.
The United States is experiencing a brain
drain, and in 2018, is projected to be short
230,000 "qualified, advanced-degree workers
in scientific and technical fields." A 2009 study
found that U.S. students ranked 25th among 34
countries in math and science. To combat this
problem, America should encourage the thou-
sands of foreign students who come to study
each year to remain in the country after gradu-
ation. Countries such as GermanyandAustralia
have already instituted successful immigration
initiatives that have lured workers away from
their homelands in order to work abroad. The
United States needs a system of its own to com-
pete with an increasingly globalized economy.
But, while a bill like the STEM Jobs Act
works to combat the lack of workers in sci-
ence and math related subjects, it's restrictive

and unfairly places emphasis on specific areas
of study. Although the United States is falling
behind in such fields, graduates of all subjects
should have the chance to work in this country.
Allowing graduates of American universities to
stay in the United States is a start, but compre-
hensive immigration reform is required for all,
not just those who have a specialized degree.
The Republicans' attempt to end the current
lottery system is commendable, but a bipar-
tisan compromise is needed. This bill should
include revisions that allow family members
of graduates to live in the United States. Such
a provision may encourage graduates to settle
in the United States and start businesses. We
shouldn't educate people and then kick them
out of the country.
Although this bill failed to pass, it laid
important groundwork for an investment in
the future of the United States and immigra-
tion reform. Allowing foreign graduates to
stay in the country is a way to encourage job
creation and economic growth. Immigration
reform law has the potential to revamp the U.S.
economy and significantly fill the void created
by a decrease in STEM graduates, making
the U.S. workforce globally competitive again.
Eventually, however, we as a country must
move past exclusionary bills and allow more
than just graduates of American universities to
live in our country.

Until all states implement these
voter ID reforms, we should still
object to the existing voter ID laws
that are genuinely unfair to college
students and other minority groups
because there isn't a proper bal-
ance right now. Many states' voter
ID laws are deterring citizens from
voting without providing extra
assistance to make up for these dif-
ficulties. Right now, more people
are being hurt than helped.
No matter which state enacts
unreasonable voter ID laws, all
students should stand together in
opposition until there is sufficient
assistance to go along with these
laws.

Mid-college crisis

I'm having a mid-college crisis. This isn't
the kind where I go out and buya bright yellow
moped (the college kid's version of a muscled-
ip sports car) or have a torrid, illicit affair with
a coworker, but it's a real crisis nonetheless.
As I enter my junior year, the impending con-
sequences of my chosen majors are looming ...
and that means I find myselfhaving to choose a
career path within the next two years. Cue the
panic attack.
Engineers can skip this article. Future
doctors, too. You won't have to worry about
finding a job out of college - you're practi-
cally biding your time until an international
conglomerate or promising start-up snatches
you straight from the graduation procession.
But the rest of us, those who are pursuing lib-
eral arts degrees, the ones who dreamed their
whole lives of law school or pursuing further
education in sociology or philosophy, we're
the ones who will graduate thousands of dol-
lars in debt with little to no job perspectives
after months of fruitless searching.
This news hits hard for me. Since I was
a little girl, my parents have called me "the
attorney." Law school wasn't so much a ques-
tion of when and how, but rather, where - as
if at 12 years old it was already decided that I
would be taking the LSAT an entire decade
in the future. I was always better with words
than with numbers, devouring books and
writing short stories at a young age, but scoff-
ing at my finance-man father when he asked
me about my multiplication tables. I wasn't
math-illiterate; I just liked sentence struc-
ture more than balancing fractions.
Now, I'm tossing and turning through sleep-
less nights with the realization thathumanities
degree holders may be in serious trouble step-
ping into the real world. The plan was always:
graduate with a double major in Political Sci-
ence and Women's Studies, minoring in Inter-
national Studies. Write an honor's thesis, use it
to get into a good law school and the rest will
follow. But now, the work force is too full of
wannabe lawyers swamped in student loans.
Even professors, GSI's just out of law school
and into another four-plus years of education,

are advising to get out, now.
That leaves me with two degrees and a
botched plan for a whole lot of research. If I'm
honest with myself, I never intended to prac-
tice law for long - it was my jumping point for
broadcast journalism. But you can't go straight
from undergrad to the newsroom (of CNN,
not Aaron Sorkin) so I devised another plan
instead. A plan that, it would seem, will lead me
straight into the jaws of joblessness and debt.
Now that I'm in the very depths of my crisis,
I've dropped Women's Studies as a concentra-
tion. I'm considering picking up an Economics
minor - never mind that I haven't yet taken a
single credit in Economics or that I only have
two years left to complete my degree. But if I
refuse to adapt to the job market, I could be
waitressing nights while continuing to pay
off student loans for an education that, while
enlightening, left me completely unprepared to
face the real world - a fault that's completely
my own. I need to start training myself to be
technical, to face a future that might include an
MBA (nothing bores me more than accounting
and finance), and a nine-to-five job that means
little more than a cubicle and a 45-minute
lunch break.
There's noeasy conclusion to this article, or
to my crisis. It won't find resolution until I find
a career in which I'm happy and stable, a wish
that many haven't seen recognized in recent
years. Maybe someday you'll turn on your tele-
vision and you'll see me presenting the news
that the unemployment rate is up .5 percent.
Maybe you'll see me behind the stained apron
of a waitress's indifferent glare. Who knows
where any of us will end up? But one thing we
must be sure of: the importance of higher edu-
cation cannot be understated. And beyond even
that, training students to land jobs in sectors
that will be seeing growth in the next two or
four or seven years (math, science, engineer-
ing) is absolutely essential. So if my future
employers want technical, then that's exactly
what this liberal arts, words-only girl is going
to give them.
Erin Pavacik is an LSA junior.

n Nov. 2008,Iwas a sophomore
in high school. Even though my
classmates and I couldn't vote,
the election was
a huge source of
excitement for
us, and everyday
I'd hear people
in the hallways
and in classes
discussing that
after President MARY
Barack Obama GALLAGHER
was elected,
everything was
going to be different. Of course,
there was the occasional Republi-
can thrown in there, but even some
of them were swept up with the rest
of us in "Change We Can Believe
In." When the election results came
in, students and townies flooded the
streets of Ann Arbor in celebration.
Whether the memory is fond
or painful, we all remember that
presidential election. There was
tangible excitement in the air: Sen.
Obama was fresh-faced and char-
ismatic and students from across
the country flocked to his cam-
paign. Many of us were inspired by
his message of hope for the coun-
try's future, and a large number of
young people even became involved
with his campaign in some way -
whether through small donations,
social networking or campaigning
door-to-door.
Four years later, however, the
mood has shifted from excitement
to a general feeling of frustration
and apathy. We voted for Obama's
optimistic message of change, and
instead got what appears to be the
same old slow, ineffective political
process that we had before. Before,
Obama's message excited us with

the possibilities of political involve-
ment. Today, his campaign is drier,
less idealistic and, if we're going to
be honest, more and more depen-
dent on the mistakes of his opposi-
tion.
Aside from our daily dose of the
oft-mismanaged Romney campaign,
my friends and classmates have been
relatively silent on the upcoming
election. Romney's now-infamous
speech regarding the 47 percent that
went viral last week was the most
excitement I've felt from my peers
about the campaign. Even then, the
general reaction on our consistently
liberal campus was an incredulous
"Who would vote for this guy?"
This is understandable. We've
become so numbed to political opti-
mism that the only things that can
provoke a reaction are the frustrat-
ing, inspiring a sigh, aheadshake and
a return to browsing Reddit. Many
potential voters are unenthusiastic
about the election as the incumbent,
Obama, is no longer the exciting new
face on the block. For many people on.
this campus, his campaign strategy
seems to be "Well, look at the alter-
native."
However, this lack of enthusi-
asm is hardly reason to notuse your
vote in the November election. The
Michigan voter registration dead-
line is fast approaching, so if you
have any opinion at all regarding
who you think will make the bet-
ter leader of our country, now is
the time to act. You can check your
voter registration status right now
at the Secretary of State website,
and either register in person or send
it by mail. We live in a sometimes
crazy, often ineffective democracy,
but it's your vote that puts the peo-
ple in power whose craziness most

lines up with your views.
It's much harder to idolize some-
one when we've seen his flaws as
a leader over the last four years.
However, maybe that's for the best.
Politics is not a
place for
hero-worship.

4

As long as we can still muster the
energy to find our way to a ballot on
Nov. 6, perhaps dropping some of
the excitement from the elections
isn't entirely a bad thing. Politics
is not the place for hero-worship
- it's the place for serious, reason-
able conversations about the issues
that affect all of us in our day-to-
day lives. That means that we have
to trade in the image of our iconic
presidential candidate for a more
realistic, flawed presidential incum-
bent who we hope is still doing his
best to represent our interests. But
if you're voting for Romney, you
probably don't have to worry about
having this problem. Whatever your
opinion on his views, I think we can
all agree that Romney is in very lit-
tle danger of being idolized.
The Secretary of State will be
registering voters in front of the
Michigan League Friday from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. Whatever opinions,
make them heard this November
and make sure to register by Oct. 9.

Green Day's newest is
offensively inoffensive

By ANDREW ECKHOUS
Daily Arts Writer
Everyone has an opinion
about Green Day, and most can
be encapsulated in one of two
sentences. The
music snob
answer is usu-
ally something
like "Dookie Green Day
was pretty jUno!
good, but after
American Idiot Reprise
I just can't
take them seriously anymore,"
whereas most pop fans will say
something like "their songs are
fun and easyto listen to, soI don't
care what that cardigan-wearing
douchebag thinks."

OPEN ROAD
'Donnie Darko 2' turned out a lot different than we expected.
A riveting.'Watch'

Ayer's latest LAPD
thriller best since
'Training Day'
By AKSHAY SETH
DailyArts Writer
David' Ayer makes cop mov-
ies. There's still debate about
whether or not most of them are
any good, but
there's abso-
lutely no ques-
tion that he's End of
made a shit-ton Watch
of them - six
out of the eight At Quality16
movies he has and Rave
written or
directed are Open Road
almost exclu-
sively about the LAPD and the
hell that can be found in South
Central Los Angeles. And after
over a decade of tweaking, it
looks like Ayer has finally come
up with a winning formula. "End
of Watch," Ayer's best film since
"Training Day," without a doubt
follows a pre-composed for-
mula. That might seem like an
off-putting statement, but "End
of Watch" is so gripping, it's a
testament to how well the pre-

arranged structure works.
Unlike most of Ayer's previous
work, this latest film tells a story
dominated completely by clean
.cops. Not a single person is on
the take, and the overwhelming
feeling at every turn of the script
is good vs. evil. Hell, the main
antagonist (Maurice Compte,
TV's "Breaking Bad") is a twisted
dude literally named "Big Evil,"
who takes pleasure in slaughter-
ing unsuspecting cops.
When it comes down to it, one
of the biggest reasons this film
works so well is that it's decided-
ly definedby its characters. There
are no complicated plotlines
hanging over the film and cer-
tainly no unnecessary twists or
turns. Most of the film is two nor-
mal, fun-loving guys in a cruiser
who happen to be amazing cops.
Officers Brian Taylor (Jake
Gyllenhaal, "Source Code") and
Mike Zavala (Michael Pena,
"Crash") are quietly tailing a
suspected drug runner until
they finally pull him over and, to
their surprise, discover wads of
cash and a gold-plated AK-47 in
the back seat. As it happens, the
drug runner is a soldier for the
Mexican cartels, who have finally
begun exporting their brand of
criminal savagery across the bor-

der to the streets of Los Angeles.
Unceremoniously, the two part-
ners are "green-lit" for an execu-
tion and the hunt begins. It's a
simple story that at times suffers
from a lack of originality, but also
one that perfectly complements
the endearing simplicity of the
characters.
Perhaps the most off-kilter
decision Ayer makes isto have all
of the action filmed using minia-
ture portable cameras attached
to the actors' uniforms. It's a
choice that ends up giving a fre-
netic, breathless feel to most of
the action sequences. The vio-
lence is intense but its forceful
pace, whichhits you square in the
face is even more nerve-racking.
At times, the gun-mounted cam-
eras make the shooting and kill-
ing feel like it's straight out of a
video game, and perhaps what
Ayer is trying to portray is the
near fantastical quality of it all.
Somewhere in our world, what
we read about in the paper and
pretend to do for entertainment
actually happens. Good guys
put their lives on the line while
scumbags walk away clean. It's
a giant, unforgiving cliche - one
that Ayer, helped by two excellent
performances from Gyllenhaal
and Pena, brings to life.

finds humor in the holes of his

himself in need of serious repair.
This is probably an ars poetica for
the real-life comic, whose barely
costumed person and signature

recall from "This American Life

a close-to-home indie feel. But
Birbiglia's welcome narration
cannot shield the audience from
experiencing the pain and uncer-

Co-directed with newcomer
Seth Barrish ("2 Days in New

only tie the two
together. On TV; it's the burning
questions in between that are
addressed for minutes, hours and
years to come.
And so emerges the problem
with ABC's new drama, "Last
Resort." The premiere episode
is satisfactory, but already feels
overly drawn out in order to sus-
tain the premise.
"Last Resort" focuses on the
crew of the Colorado, a U.S. Navy
submarine in the Indian Ocean.
When the Colorado receives
orders to fire a nuclear mis-
sile on Pakistan, Captain Mar-
cus Chaplin (Andre Braugher,
"Men of a Certain Age") refuses
until the request is confirmed by
the White House. In response,
another U.S. vessel strikes the
Colorado, implicating Pakistan as
perpetrators, igniting a war and
leaving an entire American crew
for dead.
That's certainly enough trau-
ma to maintain a season or more,
but it's complicated in decidedly
unhelpful ways. First, there's the
fact that the Colorado survived
the attack and the entire crew
are now victims of a monumen-
tal conspiracy. Then there's the
super-top-secret technology on
the ship, which none of the crew
seem to be aware of but is known
to its stateside inventor Kylie
Sinclair (Autumn Reeser, "No
Ordinary Family"), who explains
crucial aspects of the technology
while wearing distractingly little
clothing.

Wolverines return Robinson's
apology after 13-6 loss to Irish

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
On Saturday evening, minutes
after losing to Notre Dame in
what he called the worst game
of his career, Denard Robinson
wanted to apologize.
"I want to say sorry to every-
body who watches football, who
watches Michigan football and
whoever follows Michigan foot-
ball," Robinson said, surrounded
by reporters and tucked into
a tiny hallway beneath Notre
Dame Stadium. "I want to say
sorry and it won't happen no
more.
"For the 22 years I've been liv-
ing, this is the most disappointed
I've been in myself."
But answering to the sprawl-
ing Michigan fan base and the 6.4
million people who watched the
game on NBC wasn't the hard-
est part. That part happened in
the locker room, when Robinson
stood up and had to answer to
his coaches and teammates after
throwing four interceptions and
fumbling in the red zone during
the Wolverines' 13-6 loss.
He said he knew what went
wrong. He said it time and time
again that night.
"I wasn't accountable," Rob-
inson repeated.
Senior defensive tackle
Will Campbell said Robinson
addressed the team and apolo-
gized. Apology not accepted.
Michigan's 'Team 133' apolo-
gized right back.
"He's our brother - we have
to show him support," redshirt
junior running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint. "We all made mis-
takes, not just Denard, we did as
a team."
"It was the team that put us
in that position," added red-
shirt senior right guard Patrick

Senior quarterback Denard Robinson struggled this time around against Notre Dame, throwing four interceptions.

Omameh.
The defense, stout all eve-
ning, couldn't make a stop on
two crucial third downs on the
final drive, and Robinson and
the offense never got a chance
at a fourth-consecutive last-sec-
ond miracle against the Fighting
Irish.
"As a defense we all went up
to Denard and told him that it's
a team thing," Campbell said.
We kicked the ball once, that's
all we needed. As a defense, if
they didn't score we would have
won."
The three-hour bus drive
back to Ann Arbor was a som-
ber one. ("We were all pretty
downtrodden," Omameh said.)
While teammates attempted to
sleep, trying to forget the agony
of the past few hours, Campbell
was texting back and forth with
Robinson.
"He just said we all need to

step it up in practice," Campbell
said. "We told him that wasn't
all on him. This is Michigan,
we've got to stand behind each
other and protect one another."
From Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's perspective, the turn-
overs were certainly concern-
ing, but the way for Robinson to
grow from the game wasn't to
humiliate him. The coach and
quarterback had a conversa-
tion, and Hoke stressed only one
thing: "Decisions."
That's it?
"What else are you going to
say?"
So no embarrassment. No
walking through every intercep-
tion, every turnover. Isn't that
letting him off easy?
"We try not to pound any kid,
to be honest with you," Hoke
said. "Seriously, they're 18-23.
They're competing and if they
didn't practice well or they

didn't come to practice well
and they didn't have energy and
enthusiasm, I'd feel differently,
but I like the growth we're mak-
ing."
Robinson's four interceptions,
plus another thrown by senior
running back Vincent Smith,
came on consecutive drives,
consecutive pass attempts in the
first half. Hoke said he didn't
see a theme in the interceptions
and didn't see Notre Dame do
anything abnormal to disguise
its coverage schemes to confuse
Robinson.
When the buses pulled back
up to Schembechler Hall early
Sunday morning, it was a new
week. There's been no more
apologizing, and Toussaint said
Robinson has been himself.
"Denard's being Denard,"
Toussaint said. "He's got a smile
on his face and he's ready to
improve."

the Uni-
y of Wis-'

consin, Al was selected to the
Pro Bowl three times and was
named the AFC Player of the
Year in 1986 during his seven
year career.
Her brother, Nick, was select-
ed in the fourth round of the
2012 NFL Draft by the New
Orleans Saints after starting at
wide receiver for the Badgers in
2010 and 2011. He currently is on
the Saints injured reserve list.
"He's a really smart guy, so
any advice I need I can get from
him;" Molly said of her father.
"If I don't understand, I can
go to my brother. I have a lot of
resources and I'm lucky I have
those to utilize."
Molly's sister Kirby also
played for the Wisconsin vol-
leyball team from 2009 to 20111.
Michigan was upset by the
Badgers in both games in 2011,
though Molly ultimately record-
ed more kills.
Even her younger sister, Syd-
ney, currently a senior at Middle-
ton High School, is finishing the
line of volleyball standouts in the
family.
"I think Molly has a very
good athletic mentality," said
Michigan coach Mark Rosen.
"Her confidence isn't tied to the
last repetition or last success or
failure. She feels like she's good
on any day. I think a lot of that

funny because
they'd be
at Nick's game, and they'll be
tracking my game and Kirby's
on their phones," Molly said. "I'll
always get texts afterwards say-
ing, 'Looked like you had a great
game!' They're always connect-
ed, which is really nice."
The decision to attend Michi-
gan over Wisconsin seems pecu-
liar at first, but Molly explains
that doing the unexpected has
become expected.
"I've always been the oddball
out," Molly said. "My parents
said they always knew I was
going to be the one to leave. I
looked at Wisconsin, but I came
to Michigan and it was a per-
fect fit for me. I haven't second
guessed my choice since I've
been here."
That decision is good for
.Rosen and the Wolverines, as her
130 kills and 37 blocks are third
on the team in a lineup that has
continuously shifted.
"She understands a lot of
things on how to be mentally
steady," Rosen said. "Her confi-
dence doesn't move up and down
a lot. She's not cocky, arrogant or
over-the-top."
Molly and Michigan will trav-
el to Madison to play a match 4
against the Badgers on Oct. 7,
which is fortunate for her fam-
ily. This time they won't have to
watch their phones.

Smoragiewicz brings bronze to Michigan

By NATE SELL
For the Daily
Imagine you're a two-time
state champion in the 1,600- and
3,200-meter runs, a two-time
state champion in cross country
and a bronze medalist in the tri-
athlon at the 2011 Junior Olym-
pics in Beijing - and you still
haven't graduated high school.
Meet freshman Tony Smora-
giewicz, the newest addition to
the Michigan men's cross coun-
try team.
Smoragiewicz was born in
Toledo, Ohio but grew up in
South Dakota. In high school, he
became one of the fastest runners
in the state and gained national
recognition for his performance
at big meets. It isn't hard to
believe that he quickly became
one of the most recruited high-
school runners in the nation,
something that has its ups and
downs.
"(Being recruited) was a cool
experience, but it got tiring,"
Smoragiewicz said. "During my
junior year when I had cross
country and recruiting it was
hard to go back and forth - I
was relieved to finally pick my
school."
His Midwestern roots showed
through when he chose to attend
S Michigan over a long list of pro-
grams trying to secure Smoragie-
wicz. He said he wanted to stay in
the Midwest, since that's where
he's lived his whole life.
One thing very high on Smora-
giewicz's list when deciding on
a college was the ability to con-
tinue competing in triathlons,

race at the Panorama Farms Invi-
tational in Earlysville, Va. on Sat-
urday. He finished 33rd overall
and sixth on the team with a time
of 25:24.4 for the eight-kilometer
race.
"It was awesome," Smoragie-
wicz said. "The flight down there
was nice and it was cool to have
Michigan handle everything. I
spent the weekend with a great
group of guys."
But when he stepped to the
starting line on Sept. 22, Smora-
giewicz experienced something
that he hadn't in a long time -
nerves.
"I was relieved

MEN'S SOCCER
Coulson leaves 'M'
to return to Britain

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
One of the Michigan men's
soccer team's most recent arriv-
als is now its most recent depar-
ture.
Freshman midfielder Luke
Coulson has left the Wolverines
to pursue a professional career.
in his native England. The team
said Tuesday that the Manches-
ter native would sign with a Pre-
miership team Tuesday.
From the minute he stepped
off the plane in August, Coulson
made an immediate impact for
the Wolverines. He started each
of the team's first six games and
notched a goal in Michigan's sec-
ond game of the season, a 3-0 win
over Vermont. Coulson also tal-
lied two assists.
His' last game was Sept. 16,
a 1-0 loss to Notre Dame, as he
didn't accompany the Wolverines
on Sunday's trip to Northwest-
ern.
Michigan coach Chaka Daley
had been starting two freshmen
this fall - Coulson and fellow
Brit, freshman forward James
Murphy - and may have to call
on another underclassman to
take Coulson's place.
"Luke leaving the squad is

obviously an obstacle that we will
have to overcome," Daley said.
"But it is a challenge we are able
and willing to meet heading into
the heart of the Big Ten season.
We have others capable of mak-
ing an impact on this team, and
they will have to step up."
The Wolverines (0-1 Big Ten,
2-5 overall) have struggled out of
the gate in Daley's first season at
the helm, though they've stayed
competitive with some of the top
teams in the country. Coulson's
departure will test Michigan's
depth and Daley may have to put
starters out of position to com-
pensate.
Coulson had spent the past 10
years playing for the Manchester
City Youth Academy. The squad
serves as a development team
for its Premier League affiliate.
The schedule consists of games
against the youth teams of other-
teams in the Premiership. His
ties to Manchester City could
make the Blues most likely to
land the 18-year old.
"Luke is an ambitious young
man, and we wish him the best
in his endeavors as a professional
footballer in England," Daley said.

My 3rd grade teacher almost killed me,
but ended up saving my life
E AT M by Zach Bergson

.a

letter from the editors
by dylan cinti and jennifer xu
ou're a first-generation college student. The summer before your
freshman year the University tells you they want you there early.
Six weeks early. You've got some catching up to do. Under a blaring
June sun you walk the campus in a daze, questioning the decision
you've made and the friends you've left behind at home.
You're 8 years old, this weird quiet little kid, and your teacher's
standing over you. She's got her mits on your desk and she's hurling
its contents on your head. Next thing you know you're on the ground.
What just happened?
You're in an airport after a long plane ride, sitting next to grandma.
She's dozed off. Suddenly some jerk walks up and just snags granny's
purse! Nevermind that you've crossed the Atlantic and don't speak the
language here. Nevermind that you're only 9 years old. You're going to
catch this thief.
You're one of those kids whose parents sat them down at the piano
as soon as they could walk. Now you're obsessed. Four hours a day isn't
enough. Six is more like it. But the work's paying off, because some
famous pianist in Russia wants you to come study with him. And you're
only 11.
These may not be your stories, but the clarity and authority with
which they're told makes them universally relatable. Each one speaks
to the particular joys and challenges of growing up and getting settled
in a world that's equal parts terrifying and exciting,
There are more than 40,000 stories on this campus. These are four
of them. For more, turn to that person in class, the one you haven't spo-
ken to but who seems really fascinating. The one you've been dying to
talk to.
Ask them their story. And tell them yours.

Hey! Stop!

What's up?
Do you want to be in the Ran-

Sure, why not?
I like your longboard. How long
have you had it?
Like a year.
So since before it was cool?
I guess. I don't know.
Do you consider yourself a hip-

No.
I get it. You're too hip to be a
hipster.
No. I just bought my boyfriend a
longboard for his birthday, then he
really liked it so he bought me one,
and then, yeah .
Oh cool. So do you guys long-
board around the town togeth-
er?
Yeah. We also get tickets around
town together.
Tickets?
Yeah. We got $100 tickets.

Where?
By North Quad.
So you're not allowed to long-
board there?
You're not allowed to longboard
on campus or in the city of Ann
Arbor.
Well, that really narrows it
down.
Yeah, so you have to keep an eye
out for me.
OK. I'll keep looking around
for DPS. You just concentrate
on the interview. I didn't know
that longboarding was illegal. I
thought it was just skateboards
because they can do tricks. You
know, like flip kicks.
No, I wish. But they just don't
know the difference.
Can you do any tricks on your
longboard?
People can. I don't. I don't want
to die. I like myself too much to
try that.

ing was so extreme.
Yeah.
OK. So I got so wrapped up in
that I forgot I wanted to play a
game this week. Do you know
what free association is?
Yeah, you just say something and I
say what comes to mind first.
OK. Great.
Hopefully this doesn't get bad.
I hope it does. We'll see.

was sitting at my desk in my third grade classroom day-
dreaming about "Dragon Ball Z," when suddenly I start-
ed falling backward.
The next thing I remember was feeling the weight of my
desk, and all of its contents, raining down on me. A wrinkly,
turkey-necked woman towered above me. Her name was
Mrs. Pennfield, and she was the most terrifying teacher I
ever had.
Her piercing brown eyes showed no hint of remorse for
nearly cracking my head open.
"If you're not going to pay attention in class, Zach," she
screamed, "the least you can do is keep your desk CLEAN!"
My classmates kept their noses in their books to avoid her
wrath. This wasn't the first time she'd disciplined a student
in this manner.
I sat on the floor of the classroom dumbfounded, not sure
whether I should cry or get angry.
I know what you may be thinking. This guy's crazy teach-
er traumatized him for life and he's probably still talking to
his therapist about it today.
That couldn't be any further from the truth.
I'm not sure why or how, but something was rewired in
my brain that day. When I got home from school, . felt like a

new person. It was as ifa sledgehammer had knocked down
a wall in my head and a new side of me was flowing out.
The best way to describe myself pre-"Pennfieldgate" was
extremely introverted and weird. Instead of crawling on all
fours like a normal toddler, I butt-crawled. I could draw you
a diagram explaining how this works, but I'll let you use your
imagination. Until I was 3 years old, I had my own language
and clung to a toy dinosaur that was originally a decoration
on mytwo-year-old birthday cake. Its name was Tootieninitz.
When I was 2 and a half, my parents showed me "Juras-
sic Park." For the next six months, my only form of com-
munication was roaring exactly like the T-Rex in the movie
(my roar was so identical to Spielberg's T-Rex that my par-
ents considered sending him a recording). My behavior, as
you can imagine, was not conducive to making friends in
preschool.
Concerned, my parents brought me to multiple child
psychologists. When they tried to test me for the normal
developmental disorders, I refused to cooperate. "There is
something seriously wrong with your child," the doctors told
my parents.
I eventually learned bow to speak English, but when I
started school, 1,still fell dreadfully, bbind my classmates.

I was last to do almost everything. Writing my name in kin-
dergarten was a struggle, and learning to read and do basic
math took even longer.
At the time, I knew there was a reason why I was pulled
out of class for remedial math and reading, but frankly, I
didn't care. I had my action figures (or "men" as I called
them) and my imagination to keep me busy. School meant
nothing to me, and I had no interest in learning.
Even though I was far behind my peers, my parents resist-
ed holding me back. They felt that eventually I would gain
my academic footing and catch up with my peers - all that I
needed was a "push."
For the most part, my parents were right. By the time Mrs.
Pennfield pushed me over, I was probably ready to break out
ofmyintroverted shell. All I needed was an external trigger to
shock me into reality. By the end of the year, I had completely
caught up to my peers and was pulled out of remedial classes.
Looking back, I may have snapped out of my reclusiveness
without the help of Mrs. Pennfield. But if I could go back to
third grade, I'd let her flip my desk all over again.

Y MEGAN MULHOLLAND

The first time I visited Ann Arbor I had just put the
deposit down on my safety school. The second time
was the day I moved in. I came here as a daughter, who
in the eyes of my family was spending thousands of dollars
to live three hours away in a lifestyle familiar only through
the movies they had seen and hearsay from friends of their
friends. Once I arrived, I became a student afraid of Football
Saturdays and overwhelmed by my peers who seemed to have
been prepared for this experience for their whole lives,
M' I was accepted to the University of Michigan with the
precondition that I attend classes from June 20 to August 17
through the University's Summer Bridge Program. Bypass-
ing this program wasn't an option, its bolded prerequisite
announcing itself on my acceptance letter: you must attend
this program for acceptance into the Fall 2010 semester.
I must? I was happy to receive an answer from Michigan, but
my move-in date was two short weeks away and the idea of
moving out, moving in, taking classes and for the first time
sharing a 12x13 cubicle-like room was terrifying to me.
For those two weeks, I hoarded people's advice, desper-
ately trying to become adjusted to the enigma of college. My
mother, who never applied to or attended college, repeated,
"It's your decision," but as June 20 approached I could see
the apprehension and tears grow in her eyes. My immediate
family's commentary focused on my age in comparison to
my relationship status, the cost of attendance and insisting,
"Why can't you just go to community college? What about
that nice boy you're dating - you're going to move away from
him?" I was overwhelmed by my collection of advice and
watched the time before my move-in date dwindle.
The last piece of advice I sought was from a friend, a then
incoming junior at the University. He explained that we are

all given opportunities, and the opportunity itself is not as
important as how we use it. He reiterated that I would be
successful in life no matter the college, but the University of
Michigan could provide me with not only an education at one
of the best universities in the country, but also would help me
find communities of people striving to push beyond "what is"
to "what could be." On June 20 I left Muskegon frustrated,
pissed off, overwhelmed, but quietly convincing myself it
would be worth it.
For eight weeks I found solace in the study rooms of Mosh-
er-Jordan Residence Hall, bonding with fellow Bridge kids in
the common misery of summer classes, halfheartedly recall-
ing the opportunity for a better education. My peers were a
mixture of first generation, low-income, geographically iso-
lated students for whom the University found it necessary to
assume a summer of preparation before freshman year. As a
person who fit all of these characteristics, living in conditions
that would've led some of the best high school students to
drop out, I was the perfect candidate: Upon completion of the
program, I was academically ready. But this emphasis skewed
my idea of what college would be. I was entirely unprepared
for what was waiting for me in Mary Markley Residence Hall.
The moment I arrived back from the short break between
summer and fall terms, I knew it wasn't the same Ann Arbor
I'd left. The entire city was infested with parents, students
and all their belongings. The students were cordial when
their parents were around, yet pushy and disinterested when
they weren't. My first Football Saturday I walked down State
Street and wondered if the students on the lawns of the frater-
nities were the ones pushing beyond "what is" to "what could
be." Sitting alone on the street, I tried to reconcile my previ-
ousexcitement to be among like-minded peers with the lone-

liness I felt. My walk around campus soon became a sprint
back to my dorm, where I packed a bag, got on a bus and went
home to Muskegon.
I adjusted, but it took two years and the process is far from
over. I can't give sugarcoated statements on how it's OK now
when at times it's not. In this place, I have felt as equally iso-
lated and alone as I have felt understood and appreciated.
The process is continuous.
One of the first assignments of my junior year brought it all
together. The sheet attached to the back of the syllabus held a
bolded question, "What is college to you?' Two questions
were posed in the explanation: What is college supposed to
accomplish and what does it actually accomplish?
What is college to me? A series of expectations, oftentimes
entirely incorrect. Something that cannot and should not be
defined, so the only expectation left is that it changes every day.
I came to college expecting to be transformed into the model
undergrad as easily as my peers and I was frustrated when I
didn't. I have changed, but from my own volition to question
my experiences delineatingthe ideal undergrad. It is from con-
stantly reworkingthe definition of "what is college?" that I dis-
covered my passion for education reform, focusing on college as
a learning experience that pushes for growth and doesn't allow
other people's experiences to define the validity of my own.
Caught in between the expectations from home and
school, I spent a majority of my time trying to reconcile the
differences. It took my first year here to realize I couldn't
assimilate to either role exactly as it was ascribed. It took the
second to understand I shouldn't have to.

'Yu know how some people say they've had a life-defin-
ing moment? A flash of revelation where the world
makes sense and they've found the meaning of life once
and for all?
Well, this isn't it. But I promise it's just as entertaining, if
not more.
Let me set the scene for you: June 12, 2001. Slightly after 10
a.m. Central European Time. Rome, Italy. My parents, grand-
mother and I had just endured a total of 10 hours in the air (not
including a layover) before arriving at our final destination,
Roma, where we were prepared for a two-week trip immersed
in the finest Italian culture.
After grabbing our luggage, we walked to the rental car
concourse so we could leave the airport and drag our tired
bodies into a hotel to get some much-needed sleep. As my par-
ents walked up to the Hertz desk, they left strict instructions
for my grandmother and 9-year-old me to keep an eye on our
mounds of luggage.
It was a long wait. From my spot on the floor behind our
large charcoal suitcase, I saw my 78-year-old grandmother's
eyelids flutter to a close as she leaned into the waiting area's
couch. She made limp attempts to guard her purse, which was
loosely clingingto her right side.
I felt my own eyelids start to droop but was soon distracted
by the two characters that had entered the concourse with a
swoosh of the automatic doors.
They were dressed head to toe inblack (or at least a washed-
too-many-times black). If their intent was to blend into the
fluorescent fanny-pack-and-visor world of European tourists,
they had failed significantly.
I wish for the sake of my story that they weren't stereotypi-
cal crooks, Italian caricatures of Mary and Harry in "Home
Alone." But they were.
One was tall and lanky with olive-oil skin. The other was

ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULH-
short, stumpy and squat. Both looked as though they hadn't
showered in days (I would find out later this was a defining
feature of many Europeans, not just its crooks).
The two scanned the room until their eyes landed on my
sleeping grandmother and me, the youngster peering behind
the skyscrapers of luggage. They'd selected their targets.
Looking back, I can't blame them. Not because of our devilish
good looks, but because we were the most vulnerable ones in
the room.
Systematically, the two parted ways. Mr. Stumpy grabbed
a pair of wrinkled tickets out of his front pocket and
approached my grandmother, talking in cluttered Italian. My
grandmother tried responding in her own version of broken
Italian, getting increasingly flustered with each exchange.
Mr. Lanky, on the other hand, began to circle around the
scene like a hawk eyeing its prey. With each ring around the
rosie, he got closer and closer, fiddling with an unlit cigarette
between his fore and middle fingers.
And then it happened.
With my grandmother distracted by his partner, Mr. Lanky
swooped in, grabbed my grandmother's purse and briskly
walked toward the automatic doors. The short one, as if no
one had seen the two enter together, threw up his hands, mut-
tered something to the extent of "would you believe that?!,"
put the tickets back in his pocket and walked away from the
scene.
And what about little 9-year-old me? Well, I ran after the
crook who had my grandmother's purse.
Either he was a surprisingly slow thief or I was fast for my
age, but I was soon able to catch up to him near the automatic
doors. I tapped him on the back.
There was no doubt that he was alarmed. His eyes grew
wide, his jaw almost hitting the ground. After a few seconds,
he managed to mutter, "Oh, is this yours?"

"Yes," I replied, yanking the purse out of his hands and
walking back to my grandmother.
My parents, who had been at the rental desk the entire time,
turned around to find me triumphantly wielding my grand-
mother's recovered purse and my flustered grandmother
struggling to describe the event.
To this day, I don't know what came over me. Maybe it
was from a childhood spent pretending I was Harriet the
Spy, reading about Nancy Drew's wit and courage, or hid-
ing behind the bushes in my front yard with a magnifying
glass, hoping that I would spot some sort of neighborhood
crime.
Not that my reality entirely converged with these fictional
universes. In my idols' detective stories, the heroine's actions
were always celebrated and marveled at by the public. But my
heroic actions? Not so much.
Acting as the concerned and anxious parents I know and
love, my mom and dad scolded me on how dangerous the situ-
ation was. Apparently a 9 year old wasn't supposed to chase
after crooks.
But what I later learned was that my grandmother kept
her blood pressure medicine in her purse and could go no
longer than 12 hours without it. So, our trip would have been
quickly cut short if I hadn't been crazy enough to run after
Mr. Lanky.
But thanks to my considerable sleuthing talents (or just
sheer stupidity), we spent the rest of the trip tracing our fam-
ily roots throughout the farming villages on the outskirts
and hills of Rome, seeing the church where my great-grand-
parents were married and later meeting up with my brothers
in Florence. I may or may not have eaten gelato twice a day.

n elementary and middle school, I was a child piano prodigy.
You know those little kids on YouTube who play concertos
with orchestras, their fingers sliding deftly over the ivories
even though their feet canbarely reach the pedals? That was me.
I grew obsessed with watching the U.S. Olympic gymnastics
team in London this summer. But every move, I came to dis-
cover, was calculated. A wrist flick, a twitch of the ponytail,
a cheesy smile carved in place - these things drilled and re-
drilled until solemnly committed to muscle memory.
Piano competitions are kind of like that. As artistic as the
music industry purports to be, my musical years were all about
brittle vigilance. Once a year, I was allowed to learn four songs
hand-selected by my piano teacher - a concerto, a baroque
piece, a classical sonata and something from the romantic or
contemporary era - and practice them until each slur had been
smoothed, every grace note lithely flicked.
Drill, rinse, repeat. Five hours a day was necessary, six hours
preferable.
Competing in music competitions can completely warp your
sense of reality. You spend a lot of time with your Tiger Parents
on the road, driving past cow pastures and obscure grain mills
in the Midwest to play on an out-of-tune piano in the hope that
three strangers will deem you the no.1 musician of the Baldwin
National Music Teachers' Association. If you win, the award
money is not even worth the gas used to get there.
You start to think that dropping 40 grand for a grand piano
is a "steal." You own a lot of frilly velvet dresses that you rotate
out when competition season starts to swing into gear. You form
silent rivalries with other similarly dressed pianists and engage
in blistering conspiratorial discussions that may or may not be
reciprocated by your nemeses.
We had an ecosystem of people we regularly saw at these com-
petitions. The hierarchy (June, first place; Jennifer, second place;
Steven, third place) was pretty rigid, slightly shuffling if a partic-

ular batch of judges preferred one interpretative style to another.
It was a small group but not a particularly tight-knit one. My
parents and I would come home from a competition and spend
hours dissecting footage of the event. "Oh look, June's foot
slipped off the pedal," we'd crow, winding and rewinding the
tape until the magnetic strip gave out. Sometimes, one person
would vault out of the group and land onto a higher piano level,
only to find another cluster of like-talented individuals with
which to grapple for awards.
None of us were particularly interested in going into music
professionally. Atbest, we would end up like our piano teachers.
At worst, we would end up like our piano teachers.
Those years instilled in me a disproportionate sense of self-
worth. I had one teacher who liked to segregate her students
into "musical" and "not musical" categories when they began
taking lessons from her. The "musical" ones got to go to com-
petitions, attend master-classes, meet famous visitors. The "not
musical" ones were relegated to the back of the room and sur-
faced once a year to play at the annual Halloween festival. At
these recitals, we'd been instructed to scrunch up our noses at
those not gifted enough to have perfect pitch or a handspan that
could stretch above an octave. Musical apartheid.
I cried a lot back then. I cried when I was practicing, twisting
my fingers into unrecognizable shapes as I tried to get the right
combination of phrasing and dynamics. I cried at competitions
- a little before, a lot after. The judges have a sadistic way of
announcing the winners a half hour after the last person of the
day plays, so if after hours of waiting and listening, the award
you end up receiving is the dreaded honorable mention, all you
can do is publicly congratulate the winner, pack up your things,
skulk away and yes, cry.
I should say there were some good things. Winning was awe-
some, of course. And there were moments of true, Dali-esque
surrealism. In 6th grade, I went to Russia to study at the Rim-

MEGAN MULHOLLAND
sky-Korsakov Saint Petersburg State Conservatory. On our first
day, all the students were invited to a grand concert featuring
the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. Toward the beginning of
the performance, jet lag came over me and I fell asleep. When
I woke, I cried, devastated that I had missed hearing my idol,
Vladimir Ashkenazy, play live. The next morning, I attended a
master-class and played a simple Chopin nocturne. From the
back of the room, a man clapped. "You are very talented," he
said. It was Vladimir Ashkenazy.
I continued piano lessons throughout my senior year of high
school, but eventually, I fell out of the competitive piano cir-
cuit. To curious well-wishers, I tell them I "lost interest," but
the reality of the situation was I didn't have enough talent.
Somewhere, somehow, a new breed of competitors had sur-
faced, people who had earnest conversations about Horowitz
vs. Rubinstein, preludes and fugues. They dreamed of going to
Juilliard or Eastman or Curtis, the notion of becoming a home-
less musician romantic rather than odious to them.
Most of our group was good enough to get into places like
those. Some applied, got in but ultimately didn't go. The issue
was, I don't think any of us got into it for love of music. We liked
getting feedback, and we liked getting awards. One of my best
memories from those years was triumphantly grinning after
a win at the all-state Concerto Competition. My dress was
burgundy red and my shoes had thick black Velcro strips that
itched when I touched the soft pedal. But, I cannot for the life
of me remember what song I played.
I don't play piano anymore. I don't even listen to music much.
I go back and forth between whether this experience has devel-
oped me into a driven, proactive person or has totally stunted
my ability for personal growth. It's likely both.
