Budget cuts to EPA 
funding could lay 
off 435 Ann Arbor-
based employees 

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

On Monday afternoon, U.S. 

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Michigan) 
addressed a crowd of approximately 
70 media personnel, Environmental 
Protection Agency employees and 
environment advocates on the 2000 
block of Traverwood Drive, outside 
the EPA office in Ann Arbor. The 
purpose of the press conference 
was to draw attention to severe cuts 
in EPA funding under the Trump 
administration that could threaten 
the closure of the National Vehicle 
and Fuel Emissions Laboratory — a 
part of the Ann Arbor facility that 
employees 435 people.

The NVFEL, part of the EPA’s 

Office of Transportation and Air 
Quality, is a facility that provides 

emission 
testing 
services 
for 

vehicles and engine programs, 
among other things, according to its 
website. It also certifies vehicles and 
engines that meet federal emissions 
and fuel economy standards.

In a letter to Trump, dated April 

19, Dingell voiced concern for the 
closure, asking the president to 
reconsider the “misguided idea” 
when making his final budget 
proposal to Congress. 

“Cutting EPA’s fuel economy 

and 
vehicle 
emissions 
budget 

would create uncertainty, cost jobs, 
and could potentially allow other 
nations to gain a competitive edge 
in this critically important work,” 
she wrote.

Dingell, 
who 
toured 
the 

laboratory prior to speaking, said 
the work she observed inside 
“confirmed” 
what 
she 
knows 

happens every day at the EPA. 

“To the employees — the working 

men and women here — the work 
you do here every single day keeps 
our air clean to breathe and keeps 
our nation on the cutting edge,” 
she said. “You are our true public 

servants and your work here has got 
to be protected.”

Dingell 
noted 
the 
Trump 

administration is planning to cut 
EPA funding by $2.6 billion, a 31 
percent decrease — the largest 
percentage cut of any agency in the 
president’s budget.

She added it became evident 

through a leaked budget document 
that Trump is proposing drastic 
cuts to the EPA’s fuel economy 
and vehicle emission programs, 
possibly resulting in the closure of 
the NVFEL — an act she deemed 
“unacceptable.”

“We need to understand what 

we have here in Ann Arbor, among 
us,” she said. “It is the world’s 
premier environmental compliance 
and 
transportation 
research 

center. This facility does critical 
work every single day to reduce 
the vehicle emissions and ensure 
that the United States remains at 
the forefront of innovation in this 
critical field, and that is critical 
to our staying competitive and 
creating jobs in this country.”

Proposed bill would 
only apply to minors 

not behind wheel

By REMI MURREY 

For the Daily

The Senate Judiciary Committee 

has passed a new bill which, if 
implemented, will require police to 
attain a warrant when performing a 
preliminary chemical breath analysis 
on people younger than the age of 
21. The bill will specifically apply to 
minors who are not driving.

House Bill 4213, proposed by 

state Rep. Peter Lucido (R–Shelby 
Township) 
would 
amend 
the 

Michigan Liquor Control Code to 
prohibit the administration of a 
preliminary breath analysis if a minor 
did not consent to it and require a 
police officer to seek a court order 
for such test. The new bill would also 
eliminate tickets and fines, and two 
points will no longer be added onto a 
minor’s driving record for refusing to 
submit to a breath test.

In a Facebook post, Lucido 

emphasized the bill would not apply 
to youth behind the wheel, but rather 
in situations such as house parties or 
walking down the street.

“Again, the bill would apply 

specifically to people who were NOT 
DRIVING,” he wrote. “Currently 
under state law, police can ask people 
under 21 to take breath tests in almost 
any scenario — at a party they break 
up, as passengers in a car they pull 
over or walking down the street — 
with probable cause.”

University students such LSA 

senior Breanna Sullivan believe the 
law would be good to enact, adding on 
that a minor’s driving record should

increases detection
of prostate cancer

Study could 

save companies 

thousands of 

dollars with fewer 

diagnostics

By JORDYN BAKER

Daily Staff Reporter

A team of professors and 

students from the University of 
Michigan College of Engineering 
and the Medical School recently 
made 
breakthroughs 
in 
a 

study to create guidelines for 
urologists to use when deciding 
whether or not newly-diagnosed 
prostate cancer patients should 
be 
recommended 
for 
bone 

scans 
and/or 
computerized 

tomography scans.

The study used data from the 

Michigan 
Urological 
Surgery 

Improvement 
Collaborative, 

which includes about 90 percent 
of urologists in Michigan.

In an email interview, Selin 

Merdan, 
a 
Ph.D. 
candidate 

in Industrial and Operations 
Engineering and researcher in 
this collaborative study, said 
clinical guidelines state bone 
and CT scans are necessary 
only in cases where patients 
have 
“certain 
unfavorable 

characteristics,” 
but 
there 

currently 
is 
no 
agreement 

regarding 
the 
best 
uses 
of 

scans for men who are newly-
diagnosed 
prostate 
cancer 

patients.

“Our 
work 
involved 

developing predictive models to 
design guidelines to determine 
which patients should receive an 
imaging test and which patients 
can safely avoid imaging based 
on their individual risk factors,” 
Merdan wrote.

The results of the collaborative 

study have helped to reduce 
negative effects of excessive scans 

and improve the detection rate 
of metastatic cancer. 

Brian 
Denton, 
professor 

of Industrial and Operations 
Engineering and Urology, served 
as 
a 
supervisor 
throughout 

the process, and stated in an 
email interview the guidelines 
created from the study have 
been implemented by MUSIC, 
and have had successful results.

“Results 
following 

implementation 
show 
that 

the 
number 
of 
diagnostic 

tests ordered have gone down 
significantly and the rate of 
detection has gone up,” Denton 
wrote. “In other words a lot of 
tests that unnecessarily burden 
patients have been eliminated.”

The 
work 
completed 
by 

researchers 
has 
seen 
other 

positive 
effects 
as 
well. 

According 
to 
the 
Michigan 

News, the reduction in scans 
has saved both patients and 
insurance companies roughly 
$275,000. More importantly, 
it is estimated that millions 
of prostate patients could be 
spared from painful follow-up 
treatments because of the use of 

more selective diagnostic scans.

Along 
with 
the 
criteria 

instituted 
by 
MUSIC 
for 

administering bone and CT scans, 
publications 
from 
the 
study 

have also been referenced in the 
recent National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network guidelines, an 
acknowledgment 
researchers 

hope 
will 
influence 
national 

policy.

“The 
biggest 
takeaway 

from this work is that we can 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 

quality of healthcare delivery 
by influencing clinical policy 
making through the development 
of new engineering approaches 
combining 
optimization 
and 

statistics,” Merdan wrote.

LSA junior Emma Bergman, a 

member University’s chapter of Phi 
Delta Epsilon medical fraternity, 
stated while studies like these are 
important in helping individual 
patients reduce the amount of 
unnecessary time and money they 
spend, she feels it is also important 
that members of society continue 
to remain aware of progress such 
as this so as to understand the 
options for issues that may one day 
affect them.

“I think it’s easy to not pay 

attention to things when they don’t 
directly affect you but the truth is 
anyone can get cancer, anyone can 
get some sort of illness,” Bergman 
said. “It’s really important that 
you know how the science is 
developing and you know how it 
might impact you later on.”

Washtenaw County officials allocate taxpayer 
funds in support of undocumented immigrants

Proposals aim to 

welcome immigrants 

and offer human 
services support

By AMARA SHAIKH

For the Daily

Washtenaw County officials have 

allocated funds to support undocu-
mented immigrants with a 5-2 vote 
from the County Board of Commis-
sioners on a series of resolutions. 
These proposals will be funded with 
taxpayer money and are estimated 
to total about $135,200 of one-time 
expenses.

Two of the proposals aim to 

express the county’s welcoming 
attitude toward immigrants, while 
the final resolution gives autho-
rization to the county to fund the 
Barrier Buster program, which pro-
vides short-term human services 
support. It also aides the Michigan 
Immigrants Rights Center, which 
provides services to those struggling 
with the immigration process.

During a meeting on the resolu-

tions Wednesday, Commissioner 
Conan Smith said the recent climate 
surrounding immigration has had 
negative effects on the community. 
According to Smith, local govern-
ments should worry most about “the 
intimidation effect these policies 

and actions have on the immigrant 
community.”

Though the package of resolu-

tions faced opposition, it was able 
to pass with the support of Com-
missioners Jason Morgan, Andy 
LaBarre, Ricky Jefferson and Kent 
Martinez-Kratz. 
Commissioner 

Martinez-Kratz and Commissioner 
LaBarre both expressed the primary 
goal of the resolutions was to aid 
families caught in the crossfire of 
immigration issues.

“Originally the resolutions were 

written up to support families who 
might be going through difficult 
times due to increased immigration 
enforcement, and we envisioned 
that the money would go to support-
ing them,” Martinez-Kratz said.

LaBarre also explained how 

the decision allowed the board to 
express their disagreement with 
President Donald J. Trump and 
his administration’s sentiments on 
immigration.

“The package of resolutions 

allowed us to one, enumerate our 
position as a board in terms of what 
we thought of the (Trump) adminis-
tration’s immigration policies, obvi-
ously the majority voted to express 
their displeasure with them,” he 
said.

The resolutions will allow the 

county to aid undocumented resi-
dents with issues such as deporta-
tion, child custody and visas, among 
others. The board, however, made 

it clear it would not support any 
instances of criminal activity.

Much of the opposition to the 

resolutions came from individuals 
who feared aiding undocumented 
immigrants would lead to a decrease 
in job availability. LaBarre, however, 
discussed the decision in terms of 
public health and how it would not 
just benefit the immigrant commu-
nity, but all residents of Washtenaw 
County.

“We’ve had a lot of folks yell at us, 

‘Well you’re just helping a bunch of 
illegals,’ “ he said. “However, if peo-
ple are here and have a public health 
need but are afraid to get treatment 
because they’re worried about get-
ting wrapped up in immigration 
action, then it hurts them and the 
general public, which is why this 
isn’t some left-wing political action, 
but instead a level-headed set of poli-
cies.”

LaBarre also spoke to the human 

aspect of the immigration contro-
versy. 

“What many people don’t realize 

is that if you detain or deport a mem-
ber of a family who is here undocu-
mented then you tend to leave 
behind family members — in many 
cases citizens — who suddenly have 
their world turned upside down and 
may need services.”

Martinez-Kratz explained the 

majority of residents in Washtenaw 
County supported diversity and 
wanted to help families who were

test on people under the age of 21.

facing adversity due to immigration 
status. He also talked about his excite-
ment for the Barrier Busters program 
specifically because of the services it 
would provide each family.

Though the resolutions were con-

troversial, both LaBarre and Marti-
nez-Kratz believe they will help the 
overall community, especially those 
facing immigration challenges.

Washtenaw County isn’t the only 

local community that has been try-
ing to find ways to aid the immigrant 
community. At a Central Student 
Government meeting in January, 
the University of Michigan chapter 
of BAMN — the Coalition to Defend 
Affirmative Action, Integration and 
Immigrant Rights and Fight for 
Equality By Any Means Necessary 
— called upon the assembly to pass 
a resolution asking the White House 
to protect undocumented students. 

Art and Design senior Keysha 

Wall, a member of BAMN, criticized 
the outgoing presidential adminis-
tration for its inaction.

“The safety of these undocument-

ed immigrants is only promised 
under the Obama administration,” 
Wall said. “For Obama to know 
these things, and not take every cau-
tionable step to ensure the contin-
ued safety of undocumented peoples 
in this nation is disgusting and inhu-
mane. If he will not act on his own, 
then we must take action, in doing so 
set the example for him.”

Last December, CSG passed a sim-

ilar resolution — authored by former 
CSG President David Schafer, former 
CSG Vice President Micah Griggs and 
former Chief of Staff Noah Betman, 
all then LSA seniors. The resolution 
was a joint-statement by members of 
CSG expressing solidarity for undoc-
umented students and need for a con-
tinuation of the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrival program, which 
allows undocumented immigrants 
to “apply for temporary deferrals of 
deportations and (for) work permits.”

In late January, University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel released a state-
ment 
affirming 
the 
University’s 

commitment to protecting inter-
national students and faculty — a 
response to an executive order signed 
by Trump that banned immigration 
from several Muslim-majority coun-
tries. 

The Ann Arbor community also 

recently came together to aid a resi-
dent’s possible deportation. 

LaBarre said although there 

wasn’t always much local govern-
ments could do about issues of this 
size, he was optimistic about the 
resolutions.

“This issue has become so bas-

tardized and overheated, it’s sad, 
and real human beings suffer when 
that happens,” he said. “These reso-
lutions won’t fix many things, but for 
a few lives in Washtenaw County, it 
will have a major impact –– a good 
one –– and a good overall impact on 
the community.”

She 
noted 
the 
regulations 

designed in the lab have led 
to 
historical 
environmental 

innovations, 
such 
as 
catalytic 

converters, unleaded gasoline and 
the use of computers on vehicles. 
She went on to say the research and 
studies conducted at the lab provide 
background for establishing and 
monitoring Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy and emissions standards. 
She said policymakers depend on 
such work, as do consumers who are 
protected by the regulations. 

Dingell said she sent her letter 

to Trump to make sure America 
becomes aware of the “jewel” 
located in the local EPA office.

“This is a national treasure in 

Ann Arbor and we will not let them 
destroy it,” she said.

Dingell noted the budget is 

simply a proposal and Congress has 
the final say in all such spending 
matters. She asked attendees to 
make sure their friends and family 
around the country know how 
important the work of the EPA and 
laboratory is.

Ypsilanti resident Catherine Daligga 

was among the rally-goers. She held a 
sign that read “Humility.”

She noted the importance of science 

and said climate change must be 
addressed immediately.

“Science is about the quest for 

truth and scientists are humble in 
understanding it’s an ongoing quest,” 
she said. “The answers are refined over 
time, developed in peer review, and 
without that commitment to an ever-
diligent pursuit of improved knowledge, 
then we are lost. Climate change is real, 
climate change is here, it’s affecting us

“Beyond the current procedure 

being 
unconstitutional, 
the 

ramifications are not in accordance to

Sullivan also said she understands 

that this new tactic can be extremely 
time consuming for officers; however, 
she believes constitutional rights are 
more important than convenience.

Under probable cause, the current 

state law allows police officers to 
request minors to administer to

believes the minor has consumed 
alcoholic liquor or has any bodily

are added to their driver’s license and

OPINION

O

n April 18, the Los Angeles 
Police Department adopted 
new rules that require police 

officers to try to defuse situations before 
firing a weapon. Regardless of how 
disturbing it is that police departments 
were previously not operating under 
these guidelines, one would expect this 
to mitigate police brutality. With this 
new rule and growing backlash toward 
law enforcement agencies, police are 
surely on their way toward reformation 
and improvement, right? While this is 
a step in the right direction, it does not 
address what is inherently incorrect 
about police: its principles.

In every institution, especially 

government institutions, principles 
and values are areas of fierce debate. 
In fact, the core principle of the size of 
government is a contributing factor 
toward the divide in contemporary 
U.S. politics. Some argue that with 
bigger government, one sacrifices 
freedom. Alternatively, others cite 
that with smaller government, one 
compromises safety. This continuum 
that measures security and freedom is 
often debated among those discussing 
surveillance, national security and 
other partisan issues. However, the 
continuum that is more pressing to the 
morality of U.S. law enforcement is that 
of safety and justice. That is to suggest 
that many times, justice is sacrificed in 
the name of safety. Specifically, modern 
law enforcement prioritizes safety over 
justice, and this prioritization punishes 
lower-income 
African 
Americans 

for the unsafe conditions in which 
they often live. Alternatively, a focus 
on justice could spur reformations 

resulting in equity among races.

Safety and justice are principles that 

collide with each other, but cannot exist 
without the other. To put it in concrete 
terms, justice refers to the equal and 
fair treatment of an individual under 
the law. Alternatively, safety is the law’s 
protection of an individual from any 
danger or threat to their life. There 
is often a sacrifice made to prioritize 
one over the other. Obviously, safety 
could not truly exist without a level of 
justice, and vice versa. For instance, 
a country fully prioritizing justice of 
all people would allow every Muslim 
immigrant into its country despite 
potential terrorist threats. Here, the 
Muslim immigrant’s justice is valued 
higher than the complete safety of 
residents. Alternatively, a country fully 
prioritizing safety would not permit 
any Muslim immigrants into the 
country despite the millions of innocent 
Muslims who are not terrorists. Here, 
the immigrant’s justice is sacrificed for 
the safety of the resident.

The 
trend 
of 
police 
generally 

prioritizing safety over justice is an 
unsurprising one. The United States has 
a retributive justice system — meaning 
it punishes crime — and is naturally 
focused on safety. Many will argue 
safety is always of paramount concern, 
and if all people’s safety is valued 
equally, the system is flawless. This is 
problematic because a prioritization 
of safety is inherently a punitive focus. 
That is to say a police force that looks 
to safety as its guiding principle will 
always punish those that exist in 
unsafe conditions. Social conditions 
such as poverty, low employment rates 

and lower educational attainment 
produce unsafe communities, and 
these conditions are frequently found 
in African-American-dominated and 
lower-income communities. This is 
to suggest that safety guides police to 
disproportionately target Blacks and 
the poor. Alternatively, a priority on 
justice is reformative. By focusing on 
justice, the social conditions that put 
safety at risk can become more salient 
and addressable. Instead of punishing 
Blackness, justice looks to improve the 
environment of Blacks in America.

This is exemplified through modern 

developments in predictive policing. 
The 
Marshall 
Project 
examined 

HunchLab, a crime-predicting program 
that “surveys past crimes, but also 
digs into dozens of other factors like 
population density; census data; the 
locations of bars, churches, schools, 
and transportation hubs; schedules for 
home games — even moon phases.” 
HunchLab predicts where crime is 
likely to be, then sends police to patrol 
that area more heavily. Craig Atkinson’s 
documentary “Do Not Resist” also 
examines a predictive policing program, 
LACER. LACER goes as far as to predict 
whether or not a person will be a 
criminal based off of historical actions, 
age, sex, race and other characteristics. 
This is exemplary of law enforcement’s 
emphasis on safety as a principle. Police 
departments send more officers to 
confront areas and individuals more 
likely to be unsafe. Alternatively, a 
philosophy of justice may lead police 
departments to send more beneficial 
resources toward the areas and 
individuals. Safety will punish those

Justice is more important than safety

in these high-risk situations; whereas 
justice will address the conditions that 
make it high risk. That is to reinforce 
that justice can be more reformative, 
and ultimately generate larger change 
than safety can.

This being said, the responsibility 

does not all lie on law enforcement. 
It is imperative that citizens start to 
bear the responsibility as well. In his 
book, “Between the World and Me,” 
Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, “I called 
politicians and questioned them. I 
was told that the citizens were more 
likely to ask for police support than to 
complain about brutality… According 

to this theory ‘safety’ was a higher 
value than justice, perhaps the highest 
value.” Here, it’s made clear that even 
citizens value safety over justice, that 
“the destruction of the black body is 
incidental to the preservation of order.” 
If any changes are going to be made 
in law enforcement, it is essential that 
there be a reformation within ourselves 
and at the University of Michigan. Our 
values must change. If justice is to be 
upheld by the police, we must start to 
prioritize it as well.

My parents would take my five siblings 
and me to church. In a sense of quiet 
reverie, we would listen to the grief of 
Jesus’s rejection by mankind, and how 
his ultimate love overcame it all when 
He rose from the dead. As I sat in that 
hard pew, fully embracing the love I felt 
from the story of Jesus’s resurrection, I 
dedicated my heart to always being full of 
love and acceptance like Him.

This dedication in my heart has 

been the reason I am able to overcome 
a destructive belief that LGBTQ-
identifying individuals are somehow 
“sinners” — from certain Christian 
perspectives — and the reason I have 
been able to accept myself as an individual 
attracted to the same sex. Ironic, isn’t 
it? That faith and love can overcome 
religion? I can continue in this dedication 
of love only because I have first received 
love for who I was. I accept myself and 
others because I have been accepted by 
this love. This is my Christianity. Some 
call it Christianity with a little “c”, some 
call it spirituality and some call me 
religious. However, for me, it is Love. It is 
what I want to receive and what I want to 
give away.

I didn’t fully understand what love 

meant until I felt hate, and I didn’t 
fully understand acceptance until I felt 
rejection. I knew I was gay since I was 17 
years old. It took me four years to accept 
this part of who I am. Though my religion 
told me I was sinning to accept my identity, 
it ironically supported me and helped 
me accept myself. This contradiction 
changed the way I thought about religion 
and Christianity specifically. The same 
heart that surrendered fully to this God 
I’ve come to know was the heart that 
knew it was falling in love with a girl. The 
same heart felt His love and acceptance.

The word “intersectionality” was used 

throughout the winter semester in my 
Women’s Studies class. I believe I didn’t 
fully understand the wisdom of the word 

‘intersectional’ until recently. The day my 
mom told me, over the phone, she would 
not be attending my wedding, I felt I could 
identify — if only a little — with minority 
individuals battling the majority. It was 
only after that week that I understood 
intersectionality. An individual cannot 
be “partially” accepted. A Black woman 
cannot be accepted as a woman without 
being fully accepted for being Black. An 
LGBTQAI-identifying individual cannot 
be accepted as a white person without 
being accepted for their sexuality. Who 
we are is not divisible. All the books I 
read and the movies I ever watched about 
minority groups experiencing rejection 
seemed to float through my mind that 
week: the civil rights movement, women 
suffrage, the entire LGBTQ community 
— all brought to mind an understanding of 
the rejection of minorities simply because 
of one factor that was “not acceptable” 
about them, according to society. Some 
are the wrong color, some are the wrong 
gender and some love the wrong sex.

If I went to get a tattoo today, I would 

tattoo the words “fully known” from 1 
Corinthian 13:12. It states: “For now, we 
see only a reflection as in a mirror; then 
we shall see face to face. Now I know in 
part; then I shall know fully, even as I 
am fully known”. I find it incredible 
that God fully knows us, yet also 
chooses to fully love us. Love chooses 
to see beyond external characteristics, 
to not be afraid of individuals who are 
different, and to embrace the uncertain. 
Love does not fear. Without fear, I am 
free to be who I know myself to be. 
Because of love, and because of God, 
I am able to allow myself to be fully 
known without the fear of rejection. 
The love may come from those around 
us — or may not for now. However, by 
choosing to stand in the open, and live 
according to who I am, I believe it will 
give others the courage to do the same.

OPINION

Thursday, May 11, 2017

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

T

he first time I returned 
home for the summer, to 
the suburb I grew up in 

outside 
downtown 
Columbus, 

was two years ago, the May after 
my freshman year at Michigan. 
I lived at home, worked at a posh 
coffee shop a 10-minute drive 
away, and wspent most of my free 
time hanging out with high school 
friends and trying to catch up on 
reading. Even though I was busy, I 
was bored. Just like in high school, 
I felt I was surrounded by people 
exactly like me. I knew there was 
more to Columbus outside the 
bubbles I hopped to and from 
where I lived and worked, but I 
didn’t know how to access what 
was outside the places I already 
knew.

I didn’t intend on living at home 

for another summer, partially 
because of the boredom I felt 
during those four months in 2015. 
But this past winter, out of a series 
of chance occurrences, I found out 
about an internship opportunity 
in Columbus and decided to give 
it a go. When I settled to the 
conclusion that I’d be home again, 
I was determined to make this 
summer different from the last one. 
I couldn’t handle another summer 
under the beating Midwestern 
sun, glued to the flat landscape by 
the stifling humidity that hangs in 
the air. I wanted to try new things, 
to meet new people, to actually 
engage with the city where I spent 
19 years of my life. And now I had 
three years of school, a car, and a 
bike to help me do it. 

Since 
the 
beginning 
of 

sophomore year, after my summer 
at home, I began learning about 
social issues relating to race, 
class and gender in greater depth. 
What’s more, I became specifically 
interested in these topics as they 
manifested in current events in 
Southeastern Michigan. My job as 
opinion editor at the Daily meant 
I read tons of articles and had lots 
of conversations about affordable 
housing in Ann Arbor, Detroit Public 
Schools reform, gentrification in 
Ann Arbor and Detroit, and lots of 
other issues broad and specific. 

The 
importance 
of 
local 

activism as a means of directly 
helping people became clearer and 
clearer to me, while at the same 
time, I began to understand some 
implications of my status as an out-
of-state student. Although I was 
learning about issues that impacted 
all of the Midwest, I wasn’t learning 
about the state, city, or suburb 

where I grew up. What also became 
clearer to me was that the people 
who could give some of the most 
poignant insight about local issues 
were people who had simply lived 
in Southeastern Michigan for a long 
time. My best friend’s parents, who 
now live in a suburb of Detroit, can 
tell me exactly what Midtown was 
like decades ago because they lived 
there. It didn’t matter how many 
articles I read or how many nights 
I drove into the city for a concert or 
other event — nothing would allow 
me the perspective they gained 
from simply spending time in a 
place. 

Although 
Southeastern 

Michigan is where I had my 
coming-of-age as a socially aware 
person, the place I’ve spent the 
most time is Columbus, Ohio. I can 
tell you that 4th Street did not used 
to have all the fancy coffee shops 
and restaurants there now; I can tell 
you about going to the now-closed 
mall downtown during my mom’s 
lunch break on take-your-kid-to-
work day; I can tell you about the 
ice cream shop on High St. with the 
best ice cream flavor ever — Coffee 
Oreo — that shut its doors after 
only a few years ago. But, over the 
course of this past semester, as I 
began to investigate more into the 
history of my city and began paying 
more attention to current events in 
Columbus. In the course of doing 
so, I was shocked by the things I 
didn’t know about home. 

I started reading poetry from 

Columbus that spoke to police 
violence on the Near East Side, right 
over the edge of Bexley. I started 
Googling things about economic 
and racial segregation, only to find 
out that Columbus is one of the most 
segregated cities in the country. 
The dissonance between how well 
I thought I knew Columbus and 
how well I actually knew Columbus 
sharpened the further on I read and 
the more searches I ran. Although 
my shock is probably unsurprising 
to many who are familiar with 
these issues, I found it hard to 
fathom just how uneducated I was, 
despite having been through one of 
the best school systems in the state. 

I knew the suburb where I 

spent my adolescent years had 
been dubbed a “bubble” by most 
of the greater Columbus area — 
and rightfully so. While I went to 
a private Montessori elementary 
school 
that 
was 
considerably 

diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status and ability, I 
spent my adolescence going to public 

schools in Bexley, a neighborhood 
that’s predominantly white and 
upper-middle class. Bexley is a 
wonderful and odd little place, 2.45 
square miles that’s actually a city 
of itself inside of Columbus. It has 
its own mayor, its own city council, 
and yes, its own school system — it’s 
one of the best in the state, and it’s 
why my family moved there when I 
left Montessori. With wide streets 
lined with beautiful old trees 
that flood your vision with green, 
teeming with blossoms in the spring 
and summer, Bexley was actually 
named an arboretum in 2013. It’s 
different from the stereotypical 
midwestern suburb in that the 
houses are older and don’t all look 
the same; but it’s similar in that its 
people are mostly homogenous and 
the community is largely isolated 
from the world immediately outside 
its borders.

I could write for a very long time 

about all the ways my high school 
education was excellent, and I’d be 
remiss not to mention the generous 
and knowledgeable teachers who 
helped make my experience at 
Bexley High School irreplaceable. 
However, I will say that my high 
school education did not offer much 
in the way of experiential learning 
and connection to the greater 
Columbus community. I remember 
volunteering once, maybe twice, 
for a community garden on the 
edge of town. That was a valuable 
experience I’m unlikely to forget, 
but still. I feel there have been some 
gaps in my education, and I intend 
to close them in the following 
months.

I’m not sure what form this 

will take, but my efforts to more 
deeply know my home will be 
thoughtful 
and 
reflective. 
I’m 

particularly 
interested 
in 
the 

history of the suburb I lived in 
during my adolescent years, in the 
neighborhoods 
directly 
outside 

of this suburb, and in the natural 
landscape of central Ohio. These 
are all parts of central Ohio’s 
culture that I hope to learn more 
about, but I also understand my 
experiences — researching area 
histories and meeting new people 
— may lead me to topics and ideas I 
haven’t thought of yet.

Seeing home with new eyes
Empty chairs

E

xactly one month ago, while 
standing on the Diag at around 
4 am, I felt at ease listening to 

the gentle song of birds around me. 
The warm glow of the streetlights 
illuminated the 900 empty maize-and-
blue chairs positioned throughout the 
grounds. I assumed I would be the only 
one there at this late hour, but I wasn’t. 
A few rambunctious guys sauntered 
out from around the UGLi, pushing and 
kicking at the chairs, standing on top 
of them while laughing and shouting. 
Guards, tucked secretively away near 
the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library, 
jumped out and yelled for them to 
back away. The culprits, surprised and 
scared, immediately sprinted in the 
opposite direction. This encounter 
was very striking to me. They were 
just folding chairs, right? Why did they 
need body guards? What was all the 
commotion about?

The following day, I learned the 

meaning of the chairs: they were one 
of the art installations in the University 
Bicentennial 
“Stumbling 
Blocks,” 

project. These 950 empty seats were 
representative of the 950 students of 
color who were not able to attend this 
University due to Michigan’s Proposal 
2 referendum, which outlawed race-
based affirmative action within the 
state of Michigan. Therefore, each 
day, while walking through the Diag, 
students would be reminded of the 
various obstacles the University of 
Michigan has faced throughout the 
years. 

A week after I first saw the chairs, 

and the boys who trampled on top of 
them, I walked to Mason Hall for my 
Asian Language class, and saw the 
Diag was empty—the chairs were gone. 
They were collected, folded up. Now, 
the chairs are on the market, for $10/
each, sold by the University’s Property 
Disposition Department. 

After the exhibition ended, I met 

with a member of the University’s 
administration, who, for the remainder 
of this piece, I’ll refer to as Mr. “What 
can I do?”— since that seems to be his 
trademark response when asked about 
issues of diversity and inclusion on 
campus. After respectfully listening 
to my frustrations with the campus 
climate, including recurring incidents 
of racist rhetoric, Mr. “What can I do?” 
offered his remorse and explained that 
because racism is so deeply rooted 
within this country, what could he 
possibly do to prohibit it from rearing 
its ugly head here at University of 
Michigan? 

He then went on to explain his 

frustrations with students continually 
demanding 
immediate 
action 

regarding race issues on campus, 

who often demand he “fix this. Fix 
it now,” and his inability to do so. 
He, instead, suggested it was on us, 
the communities of color, to develop 
ways to establish safe and productive 
intergroup relations on this campus. 

You may be wondering what these 

two occurrences have to do with 
one another—the disappearance of 
the Stumbling Blocks chairs and my 
meeting with Mr. “What can I do.” 
The answer to that question is scary to 
admit. I am an empty chair. Although I 
am a student of color here at Michigan, 
and was not excluded due to Proposal 
2, I am still an empty maize-and-blue 
chair. Why? I am here, on display 
every day. I am on display when I 
find myself one of the only students 
of color in my classes. I am on display 
when fliers are distributed stating 
that men within my community are 

inadequate, unintelligent and violent 
simply because of the color of their 
skin. I am on display when emails 
are released saying I deserve to be 
killed. Throughout this display, I am 
seemingly protected/guarded by the 
“support” of administration, student 
organizations, and faculty—just as the 
maize and blue chairs were the night 
I was standing in the Diag. Then, after 
a little while, when my moment is 
suddenly over, I am folded up, tucked 
away, ignored, and forgotten. I am an 
empty chair. 

In 1903, W.E.B. DuBois published 

The Souls of Black Folk. In the book, he 
inquires, as a black American, how does 
it feel knowing you are regarded as a 
problem? Now, in 2017, at the University 
of Michigan, DuBois’s question is still 
relevant: How does it feel knowing that 
others on this campus view me as a 
problem? And more still, thanks to Mr. 
“What can I do?”, I now also wonder 
how must I be the problem and its 
solution? 

I am not meant for display. I do not 

wish to be pushed away and silenced. 
I no longer want to be an empty chair.

Elif Batuman’s 
story is beautiful

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Book Editor

The title of Elif Batuman’s 

new novel is a direct nod to Dos-
toyevsky, but it’s also a sly nudge 
to the narrator, Selin; or, more 
accurately, 
Selin’s 
curiously 

detached perception of herself. 
“The Idiot” follows her as the 
American teenage daughter of 
Turkish immigrants making her 
way through college. Set in 1995, 
the story winds its way down the 
path of a year, during which she 
takes Russian classes, falls in 
love, decides to travel to anoth-
er country to impress a boy and 
agonizes over every email she 
sends and receives.

“The Idiot” has no true begin-

ning and no real 
end; 
rather, 
it 

is 
a 
collection 

of the moments 
and panics and 
discoveries 
and 
revelations 

and 
mundane 

evenings 
and 

mornings 
spent 

covering up last 
night’s 
heart-

break that make 
up a freshman’s 
year. 
Through-

out her first year 
at Harvard, Selin finds herself 
obsessed with language and 
with Ivan, a boy in one of her 
classes; but she cannot speak to 
him, well, in person. The two 
find their intellectual sparks 
are at their hottest when they’re 
emailing back and forth through 
all hours of the night, revealing 
intensely personal thoughts and 
pushing each other to always be 
more precise, always be more 
probing, always look for the pro-
found.

The book itself feels profound 

(though Selin would deny that 
with all of her might) despite it’s 
often whimsical, self-deprecat-
ingly tangential nature, because 
Selin has no qualms about shar-
ing any of her thoughts, as 
cringeworthy or absurd or unre-
markable as she might think 
them. A quiet presence in most 
of her classes, relationships and 

life, Selin sometimes forgets 
that, though she is constantly 
paying attention to what’s in her 
own head, other people do notice 
her, and take note. Her philoso-
phizing is compelling and clever 
and open and droll and somehow 
never pretentious, and the fact 
that we get to be in her head with 
her is a gift.

“The 
Idiot” 
captures 
that 

which we don’t even like to admit 
to ourselves, much less to other 
people. How we derive mean-
ing, ridiculously, from example 
stories in our textbooks, apply-
ing them to our own lives against 
all reason. How we spend hours 
in universities analyzing the 
meanings of specific passages, 
right down to the phrases, words 
and punctuation, yet make fun 

of 
ourselves 

and each other 
when 
we 
do 

the same thing 
with 
messages 

from a poten-
tial 
romantic 

partner. 
How 

we 
all 
some-

times think of 
ourselves 
as 

Dumbo or Cin-
derella, despite 
all evidence that 
points 
to 
the 

fact that some-

times we are the mean kids at the 
circus or the wicked stepsisters. 
How thoughts sprawling over a 
handwritten page can be pulled 
into a tightly written email, full 
of sharp language and tantaliz-
ingly unclear threads and a time-
stamp that makes you wonder 
if they’re also up at 3:00 a.m., 
thinking about you.

How stupid it feels when 

you’re constantly awed by the 
beauty of someone’s intellect but 
scared shitless at the thought of 
being with them in person.

“The Idiot” has one of the 

most absurdly simple endings 
I’ve ever read, somehow manag-
ing to feel abrupt and seamless 
at the same time. The book feels 
almost too plain and too long 
to be called breathtaking; Selin 
would laugh at me were I to say 
that’s what it is. But I think she’d 
also get it.

Josh Brener talks tech 

By WILL STEWART

Summer Managing Arts Editor

 
 “Silicon Valley” became an instant 
success, one of television’s most well 
crafted and hilarious shows, fol-
lowing its premiere in 2014. Now, 
in its fourth season, “Silicon Valley” 
continues to thrive by satirizing the 
bizarre, though insanely lucrative, 
tech companies and their eccentric 
culture. Josh Brener (“The Intern-
ship”) stars as the show’s loveable 
goof, Nelson Bighetti, better known 
as “Big Head” among his friends and 
coworkers. In an interview with the 
Daily, Brener talked about real life 
Silicon Valley experiences, his acting 
background and the show’s talented 
cast and writers.
 Brener, with no background in 
tech, has learned a lot about the field 
through playing Big Head and previ-
ous roles, like Lyle in “The Intern-
ship.”
 “I am not really a tech person at all. 
I’m kind of a dummy when it comes 
to that stuff, but by virtue of look-
ing like someone who might know 
about tech, I have gotten exposed 
to it a fair bit through acting,” said 
Brener, who has met some of the 
most successful names in Silicon 
Valley, including Craigslist founder 
Craig Newmark. “You sort of expect 
people who are like Craig, or other 
names you would recognize, to have 
big CEO personalities and to be very 
polished. They are not that. They’re 
odd people in odd clothing choices, 
and they’re amazing — really nice 
and wonderful people.”
 “Getting to meet luminaries that 
are the people, as much as we make 
fun of them, changing the world … 
is a really unique thing. With our 
show, a lot of it is pretty accurate, 
and I think it’s what the real people 
in Silicon Valley appreciate, and 

enjoy watching themselves. We’re 
all egomaniacs: We just want to 
watch ourselves,” Brener stated.
 After transitioning from the laugh-
ingstock of the show’s fictitious tech 
startup, Pied Piper, to a multimil-
lionaire working for the rival com-
pany, Big Head has fallen back to 
his initial lousy status. When asked 
about this drastic change, Brener 
explained how his character is able 
to remain so indifferent.
 “One of my favorite things about 
the character is that he doesn’t really 
seem to care one way or another. His 
change in dynamics between being 
a multi-millionaire to some guy on a 
couch doesn’t change him. He’s just 
a guy looking to snack well and avoid 
conflict or any real responsibility,” 
Brener said.
 Beyond Brener’s talent and knack 
at playing nerds like Big Head, he 
claims luck played a huge role in 
his success. He found himself at the 
right place at the right time a few 
years after his move to Los Angeles.
 “I was in a weird theater group 
at Harvard called Hasty Pudding 
where guys dress up in tights and 
high heels … it’s really silly and crazy. 
After I was [in Los Angeles] for a few 
years, I ended up auditioning for a 
role on the show ‘House of Lies,’” 
Brener stated. This role, coinciden-
tally, was “to play a recent Harvard 
graduate talking about the Hasty 
Pudding. And, it just blew my mind. 
I went it wearing my goofy Harvard 
tie, made up stuff about the Hasty 
Pudding and ended up getting the 
role.”
 “Silicon Valley” features an ensem-
ble of hilarious and gifted actors. 
Brener expressed gratitude for 
working with such an incredible 
cast and the opportunities the show 
has provided him in future projects.
 “Going to work with some of the 
funniest people on the planet is 

equal parts inspiring, humbling 
and intimidating,” Brener said. 
“I think we’re all trying to do as 
much with the good fortune that 
‘Silicon Valley’ has given us. My 
wife and I are writing partners, so 
we’re busily trying to get projects 
started on that front as well. It’s a 
grind out here, so you take what-
ever advantages you get, and ‘Sili-
con Valley’ has had more happen 
to us than we’ve had happen to it. 
We’re really lucky.”
 Brener, in addition to his fel-
low actors, acknowledges the 
high quality of writing on the 
show, particularly in the char-
acterization of Big Head. “I have 
to give most of the credit for 
Big Head to the writers — Mike 
Judge, Alec Berg and their staff 
— because when we started the 
show, it wasn’t really clear what 
the character was,” Brener said. 
Interestingly enough, he audi-
tioned for the part of Erlich 
Bachman, played by TJ Miller 
(“Deadpool”).
 “I never auditioned for Big 
Head; I didn’t know what it was 
or where it was going. So when 
we shot the pilot, I didn’t know 
a ton, but then when they started 
writing season two, they honed 
this character. I think they nailed 
it and I’ve been incredibly lucky 
to get to be the wide eyed, con-
fused dumb-dumb,” he stated.
 Brener explained the future of 
the show and the philosophical 
change in the plot, now becom-
ing more focused on bigger ideas.
 “I’m excited about [the shift]. 
We’re going to start looking at 
big picture, big ideas, which is 
what Silicon Valley is all about: 
changing the world and revo-
lutionizing the way people live 
their day to day life.”

‘No Shape’ is bold

‘Guardians Vol. 2’ thrives

 FILM REVIEW
 MUSIC REVIEW

By SEAN LANG

Daily Arts Writer

 The work of Mike Hadreas 
— the Seattle native behind 
Perfume Genius — was, 
at least until 2014’s Too 
Bright, always lo-fi and 
poignantly intimate. Dark 
narratives that confront 
depression, sexuality and 
the dangers of being gay 
characterize his first two 
efforts, Learning (2010) and 
Put Your Back N 2 It (2012). 
On Too Bright, the tinny 
piano and fragile croon 
metamorphosed into men-
acing drones and piercing 
screeches. The deviation in 
form from Too Bright to No 
Shape is equally as impres-
sive as that between his 
second and third records. 
Anger and frustration, pal-
pable on Too Bright, are 
almost entirely absent here, 
and Hadreas’s new mindset 
is perhaps best explained 
by a lyric from “Just Like 
Love”: “They’ll talk / Give 
them every reason.” It’s not 
necessarily that his anger 
has subsided; he has sim-
ply shifted focus, from the 
world outside to his per-
sonal life.
 If anything is immediately 
apparent about No Shape, it 
is that it will be praised for 
being Hadreas’s most mature 
or developed work — pri-
marily because it is, both 
thematically and sonically. 
It also functions as a thor-
oughly satisfying denouement 
for his discography thus far. 
Learning and Put Your Back 
were as bare-bones as albums 
come, reflections of a newly 
sober Hadreas with an uncer-
tain future. Too Bright saw 
Hadreas in control enough to 
express not just sorrow but 
fury. Now, No Shape, a reflec-
tion on Mike’s almost eight 
years with his boyfriend Alan 
and eight years of sobriety, is 
rich with textures, the sort 
that augment and, ironically, 
embody the somewhat vague 
notion of having “no shape.”
 Upon first listen, you might 
wish that Hadreas hadn’t 

released singles “Slip Away” 
and “Go Ahead” before the 
album itself. “Slip Away,” 
the most triumphant and 
accessible song of No Shape, 
proudly announced the direc-
tion of the album, and “Go 
Ahead” signified a level of 
experimentation to the same 
degree as found on Too Bright. 
Both tracks are stunning, and 
together express Hadreas’s 
impressive range, but the 
album’s opening song, “Oth-
erside,” 
would have 
been 
a 

much more 
suitable, 
bait-and-
switch style 
introduc-
tion. 
The 

track opens 
with 
the 

same tinny-
sounding 
piano of Learning and Put 
Your Back, but after a minute 
it explodes with a shimmer-
ing synth M83-style. Regard-
less, no album in 2017 has a 
better start than No Shape, as 
“Otherside” launches directly 
into the joyful protest of “Slip 
Away.”
 From there, the album 
sprawls in multiple directions. 
The lush strings — a new addi-
tion to Hadreas’s aesthetic 
— that are introduced during 
the chorus of the reassuring 
“Just Like Love” return on 
“Valley,” the album’s most 
direct reference to Hadreas’s 
struggles 
with 
addiction: 

“How long must we live right 
/ Before we don’t even have 
to try?” In between the two, 
the offputtingly synthetic “Go 
Ahead” is No Shape’s “Queen” 
equivalent, an appropriately 
prideful but casual reminder 
to anyone still trying to write 
off Hadreas for his “weird-
ness” that they will never be 
in the right as far as Hadreas 
is concerned.
 What’s so impressive about 
No Shape isn’t just the breadth 
of sonic territory it covers, 
but its ability to do so while 
also capturing, in many ways, 
the essence of camp in all 

its effeminate and kitschy 
glory. “Wreath,” which ref-
erences a Kate Bush song, 
functions as the album’s mis-
sion statement: “Burn off 
every trace / I wanna hover 
with no shape / I wanna see 
the days go by.” This song, 
along with the Weyes Blood-
featuring “Sides” and “Run 
Me Through” seem to invoke 
Angelo Badalamenti’s “Twin 
Peaks” soundtrack, with sim-
ple but hard-edged bass and 

a pervasive air 
of mystery. “Die 
4 You,” Hadreas 
told 
Fader 
in 

an 
interview, 

is about erotic 
asphyxiation. 
“Braid” 
recalls 

the 
work 
of 

Vincent 
Gallo 

with it’s doused, 
drowned-out 
quality, 
while 

“Choir” feels like a consider-
ably more evil manifestation 
of Learning’s “Mr. Peterson,” 
with its closing lines, sung by 
Hadreas’s voice overlaid with 
a lower one, “What if I prom-
ise / To keep it quiet,” before 
the melody dissolves into cha-
otic chimes.
 With its ostensible focus on 
transcending the physical, it 
would be easy to miss the ulti-
mate focus of No Shape with-
out its closer, “Alan” — named, 
of course, for Hadreas’s boy-
friend. Despite his desire for 
metaphysicality, 
Hadreas 

finally comes to rest, still 
mystified, on the conclusion: 
“I’m here / How weird.” On 
paper, the four words seem 
too plaintive to invoke feeling, 
but Hadreas’s soaring croon 
could probably evoke goose-
bumps even if he were singing 
about shaving one’s nose hair 
(or any number of other equally 
romantic activities). Whether he 
means that he is literally there 
with Alan or simply here, on 
Earth, is left a mystery. What 
is absolutely clear, however, is 
that No Shape should solidify 
Perfume Genius as not just one 
of the most important LGBT 
acts today, but as one of the most 
important acts today, period.

Daily Arts Writer

The one thing that must be 

said about “Guardians of the 
Galaxy Vol. 2,” by those who 
will love it and those who 
don’t, is that it aspires to be 
bigger than the first in every 
way. The action is bigger and 
more inventive. The cast not 
only adds new characters 
but adds new layers to the 
old ones. There are so many 
jokes packed into every scene 
— every line of dialogue — 

that 
the 

whole 
thing 
starts 
to 

feel remi-
niscent 
of 
“The 

LEGO 
Movie.”

In many ways, this lends 

the new “Guardians” movie 
a freshness that it might 
otherwise lack, and with the 
ever-confident direction of 
James Gunn (“Super”) once 
again leading the charge, the 
resulting film is sure to be 
one of the most deliriously 
entertaining films of the year. 
From an early gag that takes 
the action movie staple of 
the pointless opening fight 
scene and gleefully flips it on 
its head to the last of the five 
pre/mid/post-credits sting-
ers, every scene of “Guard-
ians Vol. 2” will in some way 
elicit a smile. Not every joke 
lands, but considering the 
sheer volume of one-liners 
and witticisms tossed about, 
that’s hardly a problem.

Of course, all of the humor 

would be pointless if “Guard-
ians of the Galaxy” didn’t star 

the most entertaining ensem-
ble in the entire Marvel Cine-
matic Universe. This is where 
Gunn does his best work; 
while the film may have been 
good had it centered on the 
humor, Gunn continues the 
character-driven 
approach 

that made his first entry such 
a treat. These characters 
are, by their own admission, 
“a-holes,” and “Guardians 
Vol. 2” doesn’t just give lip 
service to that idea: It full-
on embraces it and uses the 
Guardians’ most unlikeable 
aspects as the driving force 
of the story.

This allows Gunn, both 

as writer and director, to 
add new layers to his leads 
and 
their 
relationships. 

Nowhere is this more evi-
dent 
than 
with 
Yondu 

(Michael 
Rooker, 
“The 

Walking Dead”) and his first 
mate, Kraglin (Sean Gunn, 
“The Belko Experiment”), 
who go from being sec-
ondary antagonists in the 
first film to the characters 
behind some of the sequel’s 
funniest and most emotion-
al moments. There’s even 
laudable restraint shown 
with Baby Groot (Vin Die-
sel, “Fate of the Furious”), 
whose sheer adorableness 
could easily have caused 
him to take up exorbitant 
amounts of screen time, like-
ly with few complaints from 
the audience.

One new addition to the 

team comes in the form of 
Mantis (Pom Klementieff, 
“Oldboy”), an alien empath 
who strikes up a strange yet 
endearing relationship with 
Drax and winds up being a 
highlight, even among the 
already established charac-

ters. The scenes she shares 
with Dave Bautista (“Spec-
tre”) also gives the former 
pro-wrestler further oppor-
tunity to flex his acting 
muscles. Bautista already 
proved his comedy chops in 
the original, and he shows 
the same talent for comedy 
here, but his best moment is 
completely dialogue free and 
reliant on surprisingly subtle 
facial expressions. It’s a truly 
impressive bit of acting.

This greater scope allows 

Gunn to tell a unique and 
more emotional story, but 
it does come at a cost to the 
pacing. The character-cen-
tric scenes and comedy bits 
are great on their own, but 
there are several moments 
where the two must come 
right on each other’s heels 
with little warning. It may 
seem like a nitpick, but the 
resultant 
tonal 
whiplash 

inevitably robs one moment 
or the other of its weight.

That aside, “Guardians of 

the Galaxy Vol. 2” is nothing 
short of a delight. Its pacing 
issues mean it may not meet 
the sky high expectations 
set by the first, but consid-
ering the original is one of 
the most purely entertain-
ing cinematic experiences 
of the last decade, that’s by 
no means a serious issue. 
Instead, Gunn focuses on 
growing his first entry into 
the MCU wherever he can. 
“Guardians Vol. 2” is fun-
nier than the original, the 
action is better shot, the 
characters are better devel-
oped and by the end, it has 
become a surprisingly mov-
ing story. Fans of the origi-
nal rejoice. James Gunn has 
done it again.

Michigan congressman helps pass health care bill

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

Following 
the 
revisions 
of 

Congressman Fred Upton (R–Mich.), 
the American Health Care Act — 
the Republican Party’s proposal to 

repeal the Obama administration’s 
Affordable Care Act — passed the 
House of Representatives with 217 
“yes” votes, barely clearing the 216 it 
needed. It now heads to the Senate, 
where it will need a simple majority 
to pass.

Although Upton announced his 

opposition to the bill Tuesday, he 
announced Wednesday he would 
be supporting the bill as well as 
attempting to gather further support 
and offering revisions to make it more 
palatable to moderate Republicans 
like himself.

The original GOP bill would 

have made federal waivers to ACA 
insurance protections available to the 
states, allowing insurers to charge 
higher premiums for people who have 
pre-existing health conditions and let 
their insurance coverage lapse. The 
ACA prohibits higher premiums for 
people with pre-existing conditions 
in all cases.

The GOP bill proved widely 

unpopular leading up to the vote, 
polling at 17 percent approval 
nationally. An attempt to bring the bill 
to a vote in March was halted when it 
became clear it would not pass.

The revision Upton proposed to the 

GOP bill, however, added $8 billion 
over five years to “high risk pools” 
intended to aid individuals affected 
by the higher premiums. Both the 
revised and original versions provide 
for a $130 billion general fund for 
states to use for whatever problems 
may arise with the plan.

Many students on campus did not 

find advantages to the bill, like recent 
University graduate Juyeon Ha.

“I know that one of the reasons 

they wanted to pass this bill was 
to decrease premiums, but I don’t 
think they’re going to do that at 
all — especially for people with 
pre-existing conditions,” she said. 
“That’s my biggest concerns honestly, 
because I think that was one of the 
biggest successes of Obamacare.”

She said she isn’t sure how aware 

people are of the contents of the bill.

“I don’t really know if people are 

aware that this is happening — that 
they’re trying to repeal that part of 
Obamacare,” she said. “I think it’s 
kind of written in fine print, which 
I think is unfortunate. Hopefully it 
doesn’t pass the Senate.”

Prior to Wednesday, Upton was 

the only Michigan Republican in 
Congress opposing the bill apart 
from Rep. Justin Amash (R– Mich.), 
who was still undecided. Amash 
opposed an earlier version of the 
bill, saying it didn’t go far enough 
in repealing the ACA. Upton’s 
revision, though, has drawn the 
support of three other House 
Republicans previously opposing 
the bill, putting it narrowly over 
the margin it needs to pass. Amash 
ultimately was one of those who 
voted for the bill.

Upton’s reversal has come under 

fire from Democrats in the state. In 
a statement, Michigan Democratic 
Party Chair Brandon Dillon said 
the move was hypocritical of 
Upton, pointing out Upton’s recent 
statement that “more money does 
not do the trick” to provide relief 
to individuals with pre-existing 

conditions.

“Donald 
Trump 
must 
have 

promised Fred Upton that being 
heartless and spineless won’t be 
considered pre-existing conditions 
under Trumpcare,” Dillon said.

LSA senior Candace Miller said 

the bill’s passage points to a lack 
of understanding about universal 
health care, particularly because it 
only appeals to a certain class.

“I think it’s kind of shocking 

that people don’t fully understand 
what ‘healthcare for everyone’ 
means,” she said. “To overturn 
this, I think it’s very classist and 
they’re thinking of it in terms of 
who can actually pay for their 
health insurance. They’re thinking 
in terms of their friend groups but 
they’re not thinking about access 
for all.”

She mentioned there are people 

in her home community who do 
not have access to a lot of resources 
that people of a higher SES do have.

In an interview with the Detroit 

Free Press, Upton said he expected 
the bill to garner the support of 
other moderate Republicans.

“It’s not quite a done deed 

yet, but it addresses many of my 
concerns,” he said.

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, 
Communications 

Director 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Democrats and a 
columnist for the Daily, expressed 
concern about the passage of the 
bill.

“We 
are 
disappointed 
in 

Representative Upton’s decision 
and we anticipate resistance to the 
bill in the Senate,” she wrote in a 
statement to the Daily.

LSA junior Enrique Zalamea, 

president of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, saw Upton’s decision 
to support the bill as a good sign.

“Seeing Fred Upton change his 

mind by supporting the GOP health 
care bill gives me more confidence 
that after years of Obamacare, real 
change in health care is finally 
going to happen,” he said.

Engineering 
senior 
Andrew 

Lavery said he isn’t surprised by 
the passage. 

“I don’t expect Congress to do 

anything sane most of the time,” 
he said. “I’m a computer science 
major who pays a lot of attention 
to tech and copyright policy and 
Congress 
never 
makes 
sense 

with that. So them continuing to 
not make sense with health care 
policy is no surprise, though it is a 
disappointment.”

Wolverines fall to 
Central Michigan

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY 

Daily Sports Writer

With two gone in the top of the 

ninth, Miles Lewis stepped up the 
to the plate. The redshirt sophomore 
left fielder knocked a single down 
the middle, but his base running was 
what gave Michigan the edge. He 
stole second base and the catcher’s 
throw was overthrown, allowing 
Lewis to advance to third. So when 
sophomore designated hitter Nick 
Poirier ripped a two-out double 
down the right field line, Lewis 
scored easily to put the Wolverines 
up by one.

But the late heroics weren’t quite 

enough for the No. 16 Michigan base-
ball team (11-7 Big Ten, 36-11 overall), 
as Central Michigan had an explo-
sive ninth inning and took the game, 
4-3, with a walk-off double. 

The Chippewas (13-5 Mid-Amer-

ican, 25-22 overall) were the first 
on the board. After second base-
man Jason Sullivan singled through 
the first and second base gap on a 
ball that hit a bump and sailed over 
a diving Jake Bivens at first base, it 
brought up right fielder Daniel Rob-
inson at the plate. Michigan fresh-
man right fielder Christian Bullock 
barely moved as he realized Robin-
son’s hit would easily clear the right 
field wall for a two-run home run. 

At the beginning of the game, 

Michigan struggled to have quality 
at bats, let alone get a hit. Tuesday 
against Central Michigan, Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich worried that his 
team was being too defensive when 
on offense, and they continued that 
trend Wednesday.

“We have an approach where we 

want to only swing at balls we can 
drive with less than two strikes and 
I thought we got ourselves out a little 
bit,” Bakich said. “I thought offen-
sively we could have taken better 
swings early in the count than some 
of the weak contact that was made 
early in the count.”

But the Wolverines broke out of 

their slump in the top of the fourth 
inning. Junior third baseman Drew 
Lugbauer recorded the first hit for 
Michigan with a single into shal-
low left field. With senior shortstop 
Michael Brdar taking a walk prior to 
Lugbauer’s at bat, that left two men 
on with only one out. A wild pitch 
advanced both runners and allowed 

Lewis to pick up an RBI with a sacri-
fice fly to centerfield. 

From then on, the contest became 

a pitcher’s dual. Junior right-hander 
Jayce Vancena continued his normal 
style of groundout pitching, but did 
give up three walks — prior to this 
outing, he hadn’t walked a batter all 
season. 

“Sometimes you get liberal zones 

and tight zones. There were some 
borderline pitches.” Bakich said. 
“He had a decent outing and cer-
tainly gave us a chance, pitching into 
the sixth inning and holding them 
to only three hits and two runs. I 
thought he settled down nicely.”

Right-hander Cam Newton came 

in for the Chippewas in the fourth 
inning and had held Michigan to 
only one hit until Lugbauer struck 
again when he doubled past a diving 
Central Michigan first baseman and 
into right field.

Lewis followed Lugbauer with 

a walk, and Poirier bunted to try to 
advance Lugbauer and Lewis. Cen-
tral Michigan decided to throw Lug-
bauer out at third base, eliminating 
the leadoff runner. Fortunately for 
Michigan, a double steal by Lewis 
and Poirier made the Wolverines 
a threat once again. Sophomore 
second baseman Jimmy Kerr then 
squeeze bunted to score Lewis and 
level the game.

The Chippewas threatened to 

retake the lead in the bottom of the 
eighth inning. Halfway through the 
inning, Michigan brought in senior 
right-hander Keith Lehmann with 
two men on base. Fortunately for the 
Wolverines, Central Michigan tried 
to double steal and the leadoff man 
was thrown out at third base.

Lehmann did manage to load the 

bases, though, with only one out. But 
the righty came up big with a strike-
out and pop up to end the inning. 

Both teams appeared anxious to 

end the game. But in the end, it was 
Central Michigan who finished it.

Two men were on base, no outs 

and an 0-2 count awaited junior left-
hander Austin Batka when he took 
over the mound. Things appeared to 
be going well for Michigan as Batka 
struck out a batter with a single pitch. 
But shortstop Alex Borglin crushed a 
deep ball to right field that landed on 
the warning track, and it was enough 
to bring two men home and end the 
game. 

Montemarano hitting stride

BASEBALL

By MARK CALCAGNO

Daily Sports Writer

February has never been kind to 

Lindsay Montemarano.

Last season, the senior third 

baseman started the year 0-for-16 
at the plate, recording her first hit 
on the last day of the month. 2015 
had been only marginally better, as 
Montemarano recorded a .212 bat-
ting average.

March — and the following 

months — usually brought an 
uptick in offensive production for 
the New York native. Montemara-
no was a vital part of the Michigan 
softball team’s run to the Women’s 
College World Series last year, hit-
ting .388 over the final 45 games of 
the season. In the Super Regional, 
she launched key home runs in con-
secutive games to boost the Wol-
verines to Oklahoma City. 2015 was 
a similar story, as Montemarano 
provided a spark out of the seven-
hole with a .277 batting average 
after February.

But this year, the calendar page 

turned, and Montemarano’s bat 
stayed cold.

She struggled from the plate 

throughout February and March, 
hitting just .265 with only one home 
run midway through the year. Mon-
temarano frequently finished games 
hitless as she clung to the eighth and 
ninth spots in the order, a far cry 
from the usual lift she had provided 

in previous seasons from the sixth 
or seventh spot.

And when Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins decided to challenge her 
Wolverines by benching many of 
her upperclassmen April 22 at Wis-
consin, Montemarano saw the third 
base spot she’d occupied for four 
years taken over by sophomore Alex 
Sobczak — a backup catcher.

Hutchins’ move paid off for 

both Michigan’s previously anemic 
offense and Montemarano. In the 
last six contests, she’s leading the 
Wolverines with an astounding .466 
batting average as Michigan has 
won its last nine games by a com-
bined 84 runs.

“In the beginning of the season, 

I had to fight through a couple of 
personal things that were going on,” 
Montemarano said. “I wasn’t able 
to put in the reps that I really want-
ed to put in, and I had to change a 
couple things around. But lately, 
I’ve been feeling really good, and 
I’ve been able to put in a lot of extra 
work.”

That extra work has focused 

around 
Montemarano’s 
lower 

half at the plate — something that 
allowed her to provide surprising 
power in years’ past despite being 
just 5-foot-3.

“I’ve been working on getting 

some whip in, using my legs a lot 
more than I had been in the begin-
ning of the season,” Montemarano 
said. “I was using way too much 

upper body, and I formed a couple 
of bad habits. But I (now) feel really 
loose and really strong in my lower 
half.”

Added Hutchins: “She’s coming 

in early, and she’s accepting con-
structive criticism, and she’s accept-
ing ideas.” 

In Tuesday’s game against West-

ern Michigan, Montemarano’s extra 
work was on full display. In the bot-
tom of the third inning, she took her 
familiar swing — only her legs were 
especially behind it this time — and 
sent a shot over the left-field wall for 
a two-run homer.

As she trotted from third base to 

the plate, the sense of relief the blast 
brought Montemarano was evident. 
Touching home, she took a deep 
breath, made a causal dance move 
with her arms and looked up to her 
teammates for congratulatory high-
fives and helmet-slaps — all while 
smiling ear-to-ear. 

“It was really awesome,” Mon-

temarano said. “I haven’t hit a ton 
of home runs this year, and the fact 
that the ball went over shows that 
hard work does pay off. One of the 
best feelings is touching home plate 
when your team is so excited for 
you, and everyone was so excited 
for me.”

It lasted longer than just Febru-

ary this year, but through that extra 
practice, it appears that Montema-
rano has finally emerged from her 
slump.

Lamb thrives under pressure

By JACOB SHAMES 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

One of the defining features of 

a closer is his entrance music, the 
song that plays as he jogs out from 
the bullpen in the ninth inning 
looking to seal a victory. The two 
greatest closers in MLB history 
are nearly as famous for their 
entrances as they are for their 
pitching dominance — Trevor 
Hoffman and his 601 career saves 
are inextricably linked to AC/DC’s 
“Hells Bells”, while Mariano Rive-
ra’s unhittable cut fastball and 
his entrance to Metallica’s “Enter 
Sandman” earned him the nick-
name of “Sandman.”

Junior 
right-hander 
Jackson 

Lamb has a long way to go before 
he nears the legacy of Rivera and 
Hoffman. But Michigan’s redshirt 
junior right-hander at least has the 
entrance music nailed down.

It’s not just that Eminem’s “Cin-

derella Man” is an intimidating 
introduction, with the rapper’s 
forceful delivery and lyrics on 
top of a monstrous beat. But the 
song’s theme — coming back from 
adversity to earn a second chance 
— is almost a perfect description of 
Lamb’s career.

Lamb’s first chance began wwith 

terrific promise. He was a highly-
touted two-way player out of Tem-
perance Bedford High School, as he 
was named the Gatorade Michigan 
Player of the Year as a senior and 
was selected in the 20th round of 
the 2013 MLB Draft by the Texas 
Rangers. Lamb displayed his vast 
potential his first year at Michigan 
— while he pitched only sparingly, 
recording a 2.84 earned-run aver-
age in 6.1 innings, he went 3-for-3 
with two doubles in his college 
debut and appeared on SportsCen-
ter’s Top 10 for his diving catches in 
the outfield.

But injuries quickly derailed 

this initial promise. Lamb’s fresh-
man year ended with a back inju-
ry. Moving to pitcher full-time as 
a sophomore, he made just five 
appearances before he needed 
Tommy John surgery. Last season 
he appeared fully recovered — 
striking out 13 in 8.1 innings — but 
again, his season ended premature-
ly after he broke three ribs.

It’s not as if Lamb’s talent ever 

disappeared — his 6-foot-6 frame 
and mid-90s fastball enticed the 
St. Louis Cardinals enough to draft 
him in the 35th round last summer. 
He has always been a weapon when 

healthy — his 1.50 earned-run 
average in 24 innings prior to 2017 
attest to that. But until this season, 
that wasn’t very often.

“He’s a guy who’s patiently 

waited for this opportunity — 
patiently or impatiently, his road 
to getting here has been very 
curved,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “He’s a guy who came in 
with a lot of expectations and his 
first three years had not gone as 
expected.”

In the opening bars of “Cinder-

ella Man,” Eminem shouts, “Some 
of us don’t get a second chance, but 
I ain’t blowing this one.”

Fortunately for the Wolverines, 

Lamb was lucky enough to get a sec-
ond chance — or to be precise, he’s 
finally healthy. And he hasn’t blown 
this chance, either.

This season, when “Cinder-

ella Man” begins to echo through-
out Ray Fisher Stadium, it almost 
invariably results in a bitter end for 
opposing hitters. In 23.2 innings 
this season, Lamb has struck out 23 
while holding opponents to a .188 
average. He ranks second in the 
Big Ten in saves with 10, and most 
incredibly, hasn’t allowed an earned 
run all season. 

Tuesday against Central Michi-

gan was not Lamb’s most flaw-
less outing, but it may have been 
his most important. He took the 
mound with one out in the eighth 
inning and two runners aboard, 
Michigan ahead by three runs. 
Lamb promptly gave up an RBI 
double to left fielder Daniel Jip-
ping and walked catcher Evan 
Kratt. His flawless ERA — and 
more importantly, the Wolverines’ 
lead — hung in the balance.

Lamb calmly retired the next two 

batters he faced, ending the inning 
with a strikeout. And after a single 
and a walk gave the Chippewas two 
runners in scoring position in the 
ninth inning, Lamb refocused and 
induced a game-ending flyout to left 
field to seal the win.

It was at this point in the season 

last year — the 47th game — when 
Michigan began its slide out of 
postseason contention. It was this 
kind of game — a low-scoring slug-
fest against a mid-major opponent 
— that would test the Wolverines’ 
resiliency as much as anything.

In this scenario, Lamb’s per-

formance epitomized what any 
team hopes for out of their closer 
— someone who everyone has faith 
in to calmly put a team away when 
crisis could occur with any swing 

of the bat.

“(Senior right-hander) Mac Lozer 

and Jackson Lamb are terrific in late 
innings,” said junior third baseman 
Drew Lugbauer. “When you see 
them on the mound, you just have 
complete trust in their ability to 
close the game out and get the job 
done.”

Bakich — who has stressed men-

tal resolve all season long — sees 
much more in Lamb than just an 
overpowering four-seamer, calling 
him a “fearless competitor.”

“The thing that we know about 

him is that he’s got a winning mind-
set,” Bakich said. “He’s extremely 
tough, he’ll fight you on the mound 
and he’s not going to back down or 
give in. He’s not scared of anything.

“In an extended save situation, 

it’s not about the matchup, it’s not 
about lefty-righty. You want that 
type of makeup on the mound. You 
want Jackson Lamb makeup on the 
mound.”

Lamb, for his part, recognizes the 

impact that adrenaline has on the 
role of the closer, and emphasizes 
staying in a routine as an important 
part of his approach.

“If you get too amped up out there 

you get a little crazy, and if you’re 
too calm then maybe you sacrifice 
some attack,” Lamb said. “Sticking 
to a routine helps you stay in flow.”

Bakich has emphasized intan-

gibles and character more than 
any strategic changes or tactics in 
describing the success Michigan 
has had this season. The impact of 
intangibles in baseball has always 
been hotly debated. It’s impos-
sible to measure intensity, fearless-
ness or makeup in the way one can 
count strikeouts or saves, or mea-
sure command or velocity.

But so much of a closer’s job 

description focuses on these intan-
gibles — that one needs a certain type 
of personality to succeed in that role, 
and record supposedly the toughest 
three outs in baseball. And based on 
his performance this season, it’s hard 
to debate Lamb has whatever it takes 
to succeed in that role.

As Eminem raps, “Technically, 

I’m not even really supposed to be 
here right now, so might as well 
make the most of it.”

Last season, based on his overall 

career trend, few could have pic-
tured Jackson Lamb where he is 
right now. 

But given a second chance, Lamb 

has emerged as the dominating 
closer he originally seemed des-
tined to be.

Cold tubs, strikeouts and ‘Zen Golf’: The legacy of Megan Betsa

By MAX MARCOVITCH

Daily Sports Writer

Megan Betsa sat in a cold tub. 

The television above her showed the 
game she had just exited.

Top 7: Missouri: 4, Michigan: 1
Her back ached from the worst 

pain she’d ever had from playing 
softball.

Her body felt the wear and tear of 

throwing 213 pitches in less than a 
24-hour span and from pitching just 
about every inning all postseason.

But none of that concerned her 

then — her focus lay squarely on 
finding a way to get the Wolverines 
past their Super Regional matchup 
against the 5th-ranked Tigers to 
return to the Women’s College World 
Series. With her team down 4-1 in 
the seventh inning, she needed to get 
ready for an impending win-or-go-
home third game later that day.

“I said, ‘Go get in the cold tub now, 

get ready for game two (of the day). 
Get mentally ready because we can 
still win this thing,’ ” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “You can’t be 
like ‘Oh, crap.’ We can still win it. So 
off she went. 

“I said, ‘I’m only gonna put you 

(back in) if we get in the game.’ ”

Focused on heeding her coach’s 

advice, Betsa kept a watchful eye on 
the television just in case.

“And we scored one run.”
With the bases loaded, senior sec-

ond baseman Sierra Romero knocks 
a sacrifice fly to deep right-center-
field, scoring senior outfielder Mary 
Sbonek. 4-2.

“And then we scored another 

run.”

Junior outfielder Kelly Christner 

ropes a line drive past the diving Tiger 
first baseman, scoring junior shortstop 
Abby Ramirez. 4-3.

“And then we scored another run, 

and I was like, ‘Oh my God.’ ”

Senior outfielder Kelsey Susalla 

lines a single into centerfield, scor-
ing senior outfielder Sierra Lawrence 
from third. 4-4.

“And then we scored the fourth 

run, so I jumped out (of the cold tub).”

A darting Christner scores on a 

passed ball. 5-4, Michigan leads. 

As quickly as Christner raced 

home to take the lead, Betsa left the 
tub, put on her dirty socks and was 
back in the dugout to potentially close 
out the Super Regional in front of the 
Michigan faithful in Ann Arbor. She 
didn’t feel the back pain — or so she 
claims — nor the stress on her arm. 
She was going to win this game.

Unless Hutchins didn’t let her.

Hutchins and her staff gave senior 

right-hander Sara Driesenga the ball 
to open the bottom of the seventh 
inning. They left their ace on the 
bench to defrost; all she could do was 
watch.

The move was clearly a precau-

tion for the ailing Betsa. If Missouri 
tied it up, Betsa would likely have 
to pitch into extra innings, with no 
guarantee of a win. If the Tigers 
took the lead and won the game, she 
would have to pitch seven innings or 
more just hours later. But Hutchins 
would all but admit later that not 
putting Betsa in at that moment was 
a mistake, especially as she watched 
Driesenga hit the first batter of the 
inning in the knee. 

“I walked out there and I had to 

gauge whether Sara was nervous, 
or whether I should go with her,” 
Hutchins said. “I walked back in 
the dugout and I thought, for about 
a half a second, ‘We’re going to win 
this game. We’re going to put Betsa 
in.’ Because who’s the most confident 
kid? And who has the biggest heart?

“I knew that Megan was going to 

win the game.”

***
Michigan assistant coach Bon-

nie Tholl still remembers the return 
flight to Ann Arbor from Georgia.

She recalls with horror the bumps 

that she insists nearly led to the 
plane’s downfall.

She also remembers the kid who 

was the reason Tholl had traveled 
to rural Georgia on only one day’s 
notice in the first place. The young 
right-hander had the type of natu-
ral spin and ability to miss bats that 
Tholl, Hutchins and assistant coach 
Jennifer Brundage coveted — but 
rarely found — in high school pitch-
ers.

“I actually thought my plane was 

going to crash,” Tholl said. “And I 
thought ‘This kid is going to commit 
to Michigan, have an outstanding 
career and I’m not going to see one 
inning of it.’ I actually thought that 
on the airplane.”

That kid was Megan Betsa. A kid 

from rural Georgia who had a rise-
ball like they’d never seen, and the 
fiery mentality of a bonafide ace. A 
kid who left Georgia as one of the 
most decorated players in state histo-
ry. A kid who will leave Michigan as 
one of the most accomplished players 
in the program’s rich history.

Tholl has, according to Hutchins, 

“a better recruiting mind than any-
body in the country.” She scours 
every publication and website out 
there, searching around the country 

for the potential next crop of Michi-
gan players. And ironically enough, 
in the case of Betsa, Tholl originally 
intended to scout a different player 
from the area.

A day later, Tholl was in Betsa’s 

hometown of McDonough, Ga. — a 
small town 30 miles southeast of 
Atlanta — scouting Betsa at her high 
school games.

Betsa would go on to finish her 

career at Union Grove High School 
as a four-time all-state selection, 
two-time Georgia state player and 
pitcher of the year award winner and 
a state champion her senior year.

Tholl has recruited hundreds 

of kids — some successfully, some 
unsuccessfully — in her 24 years 
at Michigan, and she remem-
bers just about every single one 
of them, their year of graduation, 
their playing style and even their 
birthdays.

So when she saw Betsa pitch for 

that first time, she knew Betsa was 
unique. She knew that type of spin 
and strikeout ability wasn’t some-
thing commonly found in high 
school pitchers. Even as her plane 
was seemingly plummeting to the 
Earth, Tholl knew she wanted 
Betsa at Michigan.

Betsa, on the other hand, didn’t 

even know where Michigan was, 
much less harbor any deep-seated 
desire to play for the Wolverines.

On her first visit to Ann Arbor 

to meet the team and coaching 
staff, Betsa asked the coaching 
staff for book recommendations 
to enhance the mental aspect of 
her game and help keep her emo-
tions in check on the mound. They 
recommended “Zen Golf” and 
another book that “had to do with 
numbers,” Betsa recalled.

She was still a few years from 

stepping foot on campus as a 
student-athlete, but Betsa had 
already begun to display what the 
Michigan coaching staff unani-
mously deemed the best work 
ethic they’ve ever worked with.

“I just remember my very first 

visit, I hung out with the team, we 
went and got Pizza Bob’s shakes, 
kinda did everything that you do 
in Ann Arbor,” Betsa said. “I fell 
in love. Instantly I knew this was 
the place for me. … I wanted to 
be apart of something that had a 
really good culture, really big tra-
dition, and that’s exactly what this 
place was.”

She was a kid from rural Geor-

gia in Ann Arbor in the middle of 
January.

Against all odds, it was love at 

first sight.

***
It was December of her senior 

year, and Megan Betsa was ready to 
be unchained.

Gone were Sierra Romero, Sierra 

Lawrence, Haylie Wagner and the 
legends who had come before her.

This was her team now.
She hadn’t thrown a pitch since 

she gritted through six innings of 
one-run ball against No. 7 Florida 
State in the Women’s College World 
Series, back pain and all, only to fall 
1-0.

She has never, and will never, 

use her back as the excuse — but 
Betsa (and Hutchins) knew that she 
couldn’t go through another post-
season at a self-proclaimed “80 per-
cent” like she had the season before. 
She now carried the weight of the 
Wolverines’ season on her right 
arm. They had to ensure she would 
be fully healthy for the wealth of 
innings she would inevitably throw 
this year — but more importantly, she 
had to be healthy for the postseason. 
There was only one way to do that.

So Betsa took the entire fall sea-

son off, not throwing a single pitch 
from June until December, mentor-
ing junior right-hander Tera Blanco 
and sophomore right-hander Leah 
Crockett in the process.

“We needed her to be ready for 

this part of the year. That’s the only 
way we could almost guarantee it,” 
Hutchins said at the beginning of the 
season. “She is one driven kid, you 
gotta hold the reins on her.”

Those reins, as it turned out, were 

only confined to pitching. Instead 
of resting on her laurels, the pitcher 
who had already compiled 546.1 
career innings pitched, 789 strike-
outs and a 1.92 earned-run average 
asked a simple question few with her 
pedigree would dare to posit: How 
can I get better?

So she went to work, doing every-

thing she could short of throwing 
a softball. She worked to refine her 
spin, despite her natural ability that 
Brundage calls “the best spin of any 
pitcher Michigan has ever had.”

She also worked to include two 

more pitches — a curveball and 
drop-ball — more often in her pitch-
ing repetoire. Doing so, she hoped, 
would counteract teams that tried 
to gameplan for just the riseball/
changeup mix that she had tradition-
ally used.

The work paid off: Betsa’s unpre-

dictability has baffled opposing 
batters, with teams less capable of 

game-planning for the riseball alone. 
This season, Betsa has compiled 91 
strikeouts looking — tops in the Big 
Ten by 51 — because of her ability to 
mix all four pitches. 

With Michigan set to kick off its 

postseason run Friday afternoon, 
Betsa’s health remains as strong as 
it’s been in years. And in Betsa’s case, 
being healthy bred confidence — per-
haps a confidence level she never 
knew she could reach.

***
At some point in the next four 

weeks, Megan Betsa will throw her 
final collegiate pitch. 

When she does, Betsa will finish 

with 100+ career wins, 750+ innings, 
1100+ strikeouts and an ERA well 
below two. She will finish with three 
unanimous first team All-Big Ten 
selections and, more importantly 
from her perspective, vie for a third 
straight appearance in the Women’s 
College World Series in the coming 
weeks. And with 82 more strikeouts, 
Betsa would pass Jennie Ritter for 
the most strikeouts in a season from 
a Michigan pitcher.

These are all statistics that will 

immediately cement Betsa in the 
pantheon of great Michigan softball 
pitchers in recent decades.

Jennie Ritter. Jordan Taylor. Sara 

Griffin. Haylie Wagner. Kelly Kovach. 
Megan Betsa.

But right now, as the May sun 

shines 
into 
the 
state-of-the-art 

Michigan softball facility, a smiling 
Megan Betsa isn’t focused on records 
she could gain or players she could 
surpass on some hypothetical list.

You can’t go five minutes with-

out somebody asking her about her 
health (The answer? “I feel really 
good right now.”), but that doesn’t 
faze her either.

She knows last year’s team might 

have won the national championship 
with her at full health, and, at the risk 
of stating the obvious, she desperate-
ly wants that chance again.

Four years of working hard, mas-

sages after games, constant injury 
treatment, game-planning with the 
coaching staff, motivational books, 
persistent work on her already-elite 
spin, Pizza Bob’s milkshakes, expan-
sion of her pitching arsenal, near 
plane crashes and cold tubs have led 
to this moment.

Megan Betsa’s legacy is written 

into Michigan lore.

But there’s still one chapter left.
