'U' professors:
Libya's future
uncertain after
Gadhafi's death

Former Ambassador
Levitsky says
country will need
help rebuilding
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily Staff Reporter
Amid celebration and specula-
tion around the world yesterday,
members of the University com-
munity weighed in on the death
of former Libyan dictator Moam-
mar Gadhafi.
Gadhafi's death, which Libyan
officials announced yesterday,
was met with uncertainty about
the country's future and joy from
many Libyans and people around
the world. The former dictator's
death gives Libya a greater pos-
sibility of establishing a new gov-
ernment, University experts said,
though the country still faces
many challenges.
NATO airstrikes struck a fleet
of vehicles Gadhafi was report-
edly in while leaving the city of
Sirte yesterday. NATO's efforts
wounded Gadhafi and two of his
sons - Muatassim and Seif al-
Islam - in the French-led air raid
in Sirte. Following the raid, Liby-

an officials announced the deaths
of Gadhafi and Muatassim.
Gadhafi, who took over the
country after a military coup
in 1969, was overthrown in
an armed uprising against his
regime earlier
this year. office
Melvyn Lev-
itsky, former H 0 R S
U.S. ambassador
to Brazil and Bulgaria and a pro-
fessor in the Ford School of Pub-
lic Policy, said the United States's
support of a new Libyan govern-
ment will help move the country
forward in these trying times.
"There is no real government,"
Levitsky said. "Gadhafi didn't
leave many institutions in place.
They really have to pull them-
selves up by the bootstraps."
Levitsky said the U.S. military
was less involved than British and
French forces in NATO's efforts
to kill Gadhafi, but the U.S. will
likely aid Libya in its future con-
struction of governmental insti-
tutions and implementation of an
electoral process.
"Libya is a potentially rich
country," Levitsky said. "But,
they will need some help in insti-
tution building, and I think that's
where the United States and

SPEAKERS ON CAMPUS
'U' alum Sara Fitzgerald promotes
book on feminist political leader

Amount factored
into room and
board, not tuition
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily Staff Reporter
Students sneaking royal blue
cups, multicolored bowls and
the occasional fork or spoon out
of campus dining halls do not

necessarily consider themselves
thieves. In fact, most students
guilty of dishware theft feel
they're taking what they've paid
for.
The commonly held belief
among students that stolen din-
ing hall dishware is reimbursed
to the University through tuition
fees is a myth, according to Uni-
versity Housing spokesman
Peter Logan.
Tuition, which is primarily

based on credit hours and state
residency, has no connection to
room and board charges, Logan
said. Furthermore, additional
fees students pay, including
miscellaneous charges like the
$1.5 allocated to each student's
school or college government, do
not include a charge for missing
dishes.
Logan said missing plates,

New book

By CHARLENE LERNER
For the Daily
While finishing her senior the-
sis at the University in 1973, Sara
Fitzgerald, The Michigan Daily's
first female editor in chief and

former editor at The Washington
Post, spent much of her time in
the stacks of the Harlan Hatcher
Graduate Library.
At an event last night, Fitzger-
ald returned to the library. But
this time, it was to promote the
release of her new book, "Elly
Peterson: 'Mother' of the Moder-
ates."
Fitzgerald's book was pub-
lished by The University of
Michigan Press earlier this year

and follows the political career
of Elly Peterson, the late feminist
who served as the first woman to
chair the Michigan Republican
Party. Fitzgerald said writing
the book was important to raise
awareness about an influential
figure in the women's rights
movement.

Minnesota women suspected

Two women
allegedly funneled
more than $8,600
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Two
Minnesota women who claimed
they were helping the poor in
Somalia were convicted yesterday
of conspiring to funnel money to
a terrorist group as part of what
prosecutors called a "deadly pipe-
line"sendingfunds and fighters to
al-Shabab.
After the verdicts, one of the
women, Amina Farah Ali, told the

judge through an interpreter that
she was happy because she was
"going to heaven no matter what,"
and condemned those in author-
ity, saying: "You will go to hell."
She was ordered into custody
pending her sentencing.
Ali, 35, and Hawo Mohamed
Hassan, 64, were each charged
with conspiracy to provide mate-
rial support to a foreign terrorist
organization. Ali also faced 12
counts of providing such support,
for allegedly sending more than
$8,600 to al-Shabab from Sep-
tember 2008 through July 2009,
while Hassan faced two counts of

lying to the FBI.
Both were found guilty on all
counts. The terrorism-related
counts each carry up to 15 years
in prison, while lying to the FBI
carries up to eight years. No sen-
tencing date was set, and prosecu-
tors said it was too early to predict
what sentence they'd recommend.
The women, both U.S. citizens
of Somali descent, were among
20 people charged in Minnesota's
long-running federal investiga-
tions into recruiting and financ-
ing for al-Shabab, which the U.S.
considers a terrorist group with
ties to al-Qaida.

Secretary of State
talks with leaders
about militants
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
(AP) - The Obama administra-
tion delivered a blunt warn-
ing yesterday that the United
States will do what it must to go
after militants in Pakistan and
Afghanistan, whether Pakistan
helps or not.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton led an unusu-
ally large U.S. delegation for two
days of talks with civilian and
military leaders who have resist-
ed previous U.S. demands to take
a harder tack against militants
who attack American soldiers
and interests in Afghanistan.
The large U.S. contingent was
meant to display unity among
the various U.S. agencies, includ-
ing the CIA, Pentagon and State
Department, with an interest
in Pakistan. CIA chief David
Petraeus and Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey
joined Clinton, who said the
team would "push Pakistan very
hard."
There were cordial hand-
shakes and greetings among
the large U.S. and Pakistani del-
egation gathered at the office
of Prime Minister Yousuf Raza
Gilani as the first of two evening

meetings began. Pakistan's for-
eign minister, Army chief and
intelligence head were expected
to see their U.S. counterparts
yesterday.
Clinton arrived in Islamabad
from Afghanistan, where she
told Pakistan it must be part of
the solution to the Afghan con-
flict. She said the U.S. expects
the Pakistani government, mili-
tary and intelligence services to
take the lead in fighting Paki-
stan-based militants and also in
encouraging Afghan militants to
reconcile.
"Our message is very clear,"
Clinton said. "We're going to
be fighting, we are going to be
talking and we are going to be
building ... and they can either be
helping or hindering, but we are
not going to stop."
The meetings focused on the
recurrent U.S. demand that Paki-
stan launch its own offensive
against a lethal Taliban affiliate
known as the Haqqani network.
It operates on both sides of the
Afghanistan-Pakistan border;
U.S. officials claim Pakistan
either tolerates or supports the
group's activities.
A senior U.S. official said
Thursday's four hours of meet-
ings were "extremely frank" and
"very detailed" but declined to
offer details.
In a statement, Gilani's office
said the discussion was "cordial

and frank." But it also suggested
Pakistan was unhappy with the
message push by recalling state-
ments denying U.S. allegations
of links between Pakistan and
militants.
"Disagreements between the
coalition partners in the war on
terror should not undermine
strategic relationship which is so
vital for the promotion of mutual
interests of the two countries,"
the statement quoted Gilani as
saying.
U.S. military leaders have told
the Pakistanis that if Islamabad
does not act against the Haqqa-
nis, the U.S. will.
"We must send a clear,
unequivocal message to the gov-
ernment and people of Pakistan
that they must be part of the
solution, and that means rid-
ding their own country of ter-
rorists who kill their own people
and who cross the border to kill
people in Afghanistan," Clinton
said.
Pakistan has deployed 170,000
soldiers to its eastern border
with Afghanistan and more than
3,000 soldiers have died in bat-
tles with militants. So Pakistani
leaders bristle at U.S. criticism
that they have not done enough
or that they play a double game -
fighting militants in some areas,
supporting them in others where
they might be useful proxies in a
future conflict with India.

born at the zoo in the past 20
years.
Two days after their birth,
tests run by the veterinary staff

The top Democrat on the

the recent series of conference
realignments.
"It has become increasingly
clear to me that the combina-
tion of issues and challenges fac-
ing intercollegiate sports have
reached a tipping point calling for
congressional attention," Michi-
gan Rep. John Conyers wrote to
the committee chairman, Texas
Republican Lamar Smith, in a let-
ter released yesterday. The com-
mittee said in a statement that it

Chavez announces
he is cancer-free
Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said he is cancer-free,
citing a series of medical exams
in Cuba that showed no recur-

months of chemotherapy treat-
ments.
The 57-year-old leader
announced the test results on live
television yesterday after return-
ing from Cuba, saying thorough
exams found no sign of any malig-
nant cells in his body.
"I'm free of illness," Chavez
said on state television, wearing
military fatigues as he arrived in
the southwestern town of La Fria.
Crowds of supporters cheered
for Chavez as he rode in a caravan
to the town of La Grita, where he
visited a church that is home to
a famed image of Christ, whom
Chavez referred to as "the coman-
dante of comandantes."
Chavez said he came to give
thanks for his recovery.
"It's like a miracle that I'm

to red-clad supporters who filled
a square and waved excitedly to
him.
MEXICO CITY, Mexico
U.S. accused of
dumping criminals
at Mexico boarder
Mexican President Felipe
Calderon accused the United
States yesterday of dumping crim-
inals at the border because it is
cheaper than prosecuting them,
and said the practice has fueled
violence in Mexico's border areas.
U.S. officials earlier this week
reported a record number of
deportations in fiscal year 2011,
and said the number of deportees
with criminal convictions had
nearly doubled since 2008.
"There are many factors in the
violence that is being experienced
in some Mexican border cities,
but one of those is that the Ameri-
can authorities have gotten into
the habit of simply deporting 60
(thousand) or 70,000 migrants per
year to cities like Ciudad Juarez or
Tijuana," Calderon told an immi-
gration conference.

OCCUPY A2
From Page 1A
ment pooled its resources and now
communicates more efficiently. As
a result, the camp attracted dona-
tions including food, tarps, sleep-
ing bags, banners and camping
gear.
"The first week was really cha-
otic, but we're really getting our
organization together and getting
a lot of resources together," Levi-
joki said.
Still, Levijoki said she thinks
the protest is "not as organized as
it could be." Though the encamp-
ment has received plenty of food
- even enough to donate a por-
tion to Occupy Detroit and Occupy
Lansing - other supplies are lim-
ited due to a lack of coordination
among movement leaders.
To prevent future logisti-
cal issues, the assembly formed
a scheduling committee to plan
events and communicate infor-
mation to the public. The assem-
bly members also discussed a
proposal to set up a workshop for
protesters to learn about outreach,
rights, non-violent protests and
methods for writing effective let-
ters to politicians - initiatives that
movement participants hope will
further the scope of Occupy Ann
Arbor.
Several protesters who were
invited to speak in front of the
crowd urged participants to foster
solidarity between local, regional
and global Occupy movements.
Whitney Miller, a recent Univer-
sity alum who started Occupy
Ann Arbor through a Facebook
page, stressed the importance of

relationships between the move-
ments.
"The direct action committee
has been working very actively
to research, gather resources,
check legality, secure safety and
plan an effective occupation,"
Miller said.
Miller added that the move-
mentis onlytwo weeks old and has
much potential to grow, become
more unified and gain more sup-
port. An encouraging sign, Miller
said, is the Ann Arbor Education
Association's - a citywide teach-
ers union - endorsement of the
Occupy movements.
Despite the speaker's positiv-
ity, several protesters raised con-
cerns including the feasibility of
an occupation in Liberty Plaza as
winter nears. Several participants
also discussed the safety of the
plaza.
Jeff Fulkerson, a junior at
Washtenaw Community College
and a participant at last night's
gathering, said the square is noto-
rious for drug and alcohol prob-
lems, which have been apparent
duringthe encampment.
Fulkerson said a homeless man
unaffiliated with the movement
threatened the protesters camp-
ing in the plaza and used drugs in
the area. The situation made some
protesters, including studentsy flee
the plaza out of fear, he said. Fulk-
erson added that he'd like to see
the movement moved to another
park - a proposition other !pro-
testers supported.
"Most of the students have
either left or fled the scene because
they are afraid of the person,"
Fulkerson said. "These scenes
need tobe addressed."

2012 presidential
contest shaping up
like 2004 election
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
beleaguered president seeks
re-election. His challenger,
a candidate with Massachu-

tial demeanor straight out of
central casting, has to fight
through a primary contest
fending off charges of flip-

eloquent on the stump but per-
ceived as remote or aloof on the
campaign circuit.
Even before Romney has
won a single nominating con-
test, Obama's camp is singling
him out as a fickle politician
and is preparing to go straight
at Romney's perceived strength
- his record as a businessman
in the face of a flat-line econo-
my. It was a strategy Republi-
cans employed against Kerry,
who faced flip-flopping claims
himself and whose strength as
a decorated Vietnam veteran
running in the first post-Sept.
11 election was undermined by
attack ads.
A key feature of the Obama
strategy is Romney's tenure as
head of Bain Capital, a private
MANAEDBY

equity firm he co-founded in
1984 that saved and launched
businesses such as Staples and
Domino's Pizza but sliced jobs
elsewhere through cost-cutting
and consolidation.
It's not the first time Rom-
ney's tenure at the helm of
Bain Capital has come under
attack. Sen. Edward M. Ken-
nedy pulled away from Rom-
ney during his 1994 Senate race
in Massachusetts by airing a
series of ads that featured work-
ers from an Indiana paper plant
that Bain took over, laying off
employees, cutting wages and
reducingbenefits.
"Basically, he cut our
throats," a worker said in one of
the ads.
"When we made the decision
to define him to voters of Mas-
sachusetts and took a hard line
in doing so, we had a lot of suc-
cess," said Democratic consul-
tant Tad Devine, who crafted
the ads for Kennedy and later
served as a senior adviser to
Kerry's presidential campaign.
Obama advisers are keenly
aware of Kennedy's line of
attack and are counting on sim-
ilar results.
"In his professional life,
he was an expert in stripping
down companies and leading
them to bankruptcy and profit-
ing from these ventures, with a
lot of jobs lost in the process,"
said Obama strategist David
Axelrod, previewing a potential
line of attack.
"Whenever you're running
for president of the United
States and you represent your-
self ina certain way and you say
here's my core asset, then you
need to be able to stand by your
record," Axelrod added in an
interview. "It was problematic
for him then; it will be problem-
atic for him now."
Republicans concede that
Romney could be vulnerable.
But they say the Romney camp
should be ready for the
onslaught.

Michael Dennehy, a New
Hampshire-based Republican
strategist, said he remembers
Kennedy's anti-Romney ads as
being "just brutal and very, very
effective."
"To some extent it will
be effective again," he said.
"The variable is how Romney
responds and what they have
learned from that 1994 race for
Senate."
Dennehy, who helped run
Sen. John McCain's presiden-
tial races in 2000 and 2008,
added: "I think we can expect
from Obama's campaign a very
scorched-earth approach. It's
the only way he can win."
Top Romney strategist Eric
Fehrnstrom said Obama, faced
with a stagnant economy, is
grasping for ways to win. "Now,
they are employing a 'kill Mitt'
strategy," he said. "I suspect
they'll go through many other
strategies before they realize
this election is a referendum on
Obama's failed leadership on
jobs."

Regents must ensure meeting times are known my best friend at Barnard Col-
legein New York City. Barnard

t cannot be said enough, the University Board of Regents
must maintain complete transparency. The public's trust was
violated when the start time of the Oct. 13 regents meeting
was unexpectedly changed. The regents also violated the Michigan
Open Meetings Act by moving the start time without enough prior
notice, according to an attorney familiar with the law. The regents
are entrusted with making important decisions that affect students
and must make every effort to ensure their doors are always open
- literally and metaphorically - to University students.

Last Thursday, the Board of Regents held*
its monthly meeting. The meeting was origi-
nally scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. in Flint. But
that morning, its start time was moved to 2
p.m. The Michigan Open Meetings Act of 1976
stipulates that a public body must give "a pub-
lic notice stating the date, time and place " no
less than 18 hours before a regular meeting is
being rescheduled.
University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald con-
firmed the decision to change the meeting
time was made Thursday morning. A notice
was posted on the board's website and certain
members of the University of Michigan-Flint
community were informed via e-mail.
While this wasn't considered a legal viola-
tion of the Open Meetings Act by the Univer-
sity's Office of General Counsel, it was still
unethical of the board to change the meeting's
start time on such short notice. The Univer-
sity is a public institution, and the regents are
electedbythe Michiganvoters. As aresult, the
public expects the regents to be open about
all proceedings and discussions at meetings
in accordance with state law. Thus, it should
strive to always keep the public informed
about meeting times and locations well in
advance, and ensure adequate notice of adjust-
ments.
The regents are responsible for making

important decisions concerning the student
body. As Southfield, Mich.-based attorney
Lisa Rycus Mikalonis told The Michigan
Daily, "you need to have access to the decision-
making processes of the public bodies." The
board's recent action limits students' access to
them and the decision making process.
Many important decisions were discussed
at Thursday's meeting, including granting an
honorary degree to Winter Commencement
speaker and New York Times Executive Edi-
tor Jill Abramson. The regents argue there
were no members of the public signed up to
speak during the public comment period, so
the time change had little effect. Though no
one was signed up to speak in advance, any
student should have the opportunity to attend
the meeting - even at the last minute - and
listen and contribute to the discussion.
The matter comes down to the principle
of transparency. Whether the meeting is well
attended or not, the regents have a duty to
ensure that everyone's voice can be heard.
This means making an effort to present cor-
rect information about the meeting and ensur-
ing that if any changes occur, the public is
notified according to the Open Meetings Act.
The regents cannot make decisions behind
closed doors, and students should always have
the opportunity to be a part of discussions.

I've visited Barnard five times,
which I believe - wrongly - earns
me dual school citizenship. I've
joined my friend more than once
as she guides prospective students
(and the occasional Rwandan prin-
cess) through campus, I've lurked
in the back row of three of her
classes (who knew dramaturgy was
a thing?) and I've bonded with a
handful of the college's employees
while watching the Dr. Drew show
at Barnard's student center. I even
crashed a Barnard event in London
in search of free hors d'eourves and
a babysitting job.
With each visit, I become a bet-
ter skilled Barnard poser. I am - for
all practical purposes - a Barnard
woman. Except that I go here, and
that "here" is aBig Tenschool. Until
last weekend, going to a school that
identifies strongly with its football
tradition didn't seem so relevant
to my identity. But last weekend at
Barnard, it was for that reason all
the Columbia students posed as me.
Well not me, us.

Last weekend was Colum-
bia's homecoming football game.
Homecoming at Columbia is called
Christmas, and it's a really big deal.
The goal, I think, is to flood the
streets of the (upper) Upper West-
side with the spirit, fandom and
debauchery of state school football
game days. Because I was the only
one celebrating Columbia Christ-
mas who knew intimately well their
ideal game day, I became a de facto
authority on wildness. (That always
happens.) I observed throughout
the day how "state school" these
city kids could be.
We woke up at 10:30 a.m. to buy
fresh fruit for our homemade pan-
cakes. We should have woken up at
8 a.m. to buy a case of cheap beer
to wash down (by way of a funnel)
our pancakes from a box. And we
should have done it all on the fire
escape, which, I guess, is the city's
version of a front porch.
We walked down Broadway on
our way to the fraternities, stopping
alongside children and the elderly to
admire baked goods that were being
sold at the Broadway street market.
Wrong. State schools don't contain
those demographics and, on game
day, the only thing we ever stop to
admire is an expertly carved ice luge.
By the time we got to the fraterni-
ties (by which I mean brownstones
filled with boys in bow ties), they
were almost out of beer and some-
one unqualified had hijacked the
iPod. But there was a trulylimitless
amount of bagels and schmear. Not
a state school, but awesome.
As the pregame thinned out,
groups of students in jerseys asked
each other with scrunched up faces,
"Are you going to the game?"''Yeah!
It's senior year! Plus, they're giving

away free stuff!" At state schools,
you make dumb excuses about why
you're not going to the game.
Then we started our trek to the
stadium. In New York City, that
means a 25-minute bus ride, which,
for me, means a25-minute nap.And
in New York City, when a friend
says she's grabbing something to
eat onthe way, she might come back
with a skewer of chocolate covered
strawberries instead of a Panche-
ro's burrito.
Barnard tries to
mirror Football
Saturdays at 'U.'
When we got to the stadium (let's
call it the little house), I felt like I
was at a carnival instead of a foot-
ball game. Face painters wanted to
draw C's on my cheeks, the pop-
corn machines flowed freely and
the moon bounces - yeah, there
were moon bounces - stood firm.
Columbia students wrestled their
way past the young children of
alumni to climb inflated surfaces.
I respected their determination
because at state school football
games, the students matter.
During our half-time subway
ride back to campus, I talked to
some guys in plaid about the day.
"Sowhat'd you think? Was it any-
thing like a Michigan game day?"
Yeah, I think it was. Isn't Christmas
all about the spirit?

Coleman should continue to
push sustainability forward
TO THE DAILY:
Dear University President Mary Sue Cole-
man,
The Student Sustainability Initiative would
like to recognize and thank you for your com-
mitment to an environmentally sustainable
University. The long-awaited sustainability
goals you announced were widely celebrat-
ed across campus and represented a truly
momentous day for the University. We com-
mend you for your leadership and thank you
for listening to the voice of the students.
The first steps we take moving forward
now are crucial for setting the pace at which
we pursue a sustainable University. With
this commitment, the University has moved
towards institutionalizing the pursuit of sus-
tainability; however full institutionalization
requires translating the speech and written
commitments into a fully embraced culture of
sustainability. It means imparting in all Uni-
versity decision-makers a strong understand-
ing of what sustainability is and what it means
for them. It means integrating sustainabil-
ity into their decision-making processes and
instilling a willingness to make changes, try
out new things and even accept the occasional
failure. It means taking the responsibility for
the success or failure of a single event or ini-
tiative off the shoulders of an individual and
placing it inthe broader context of the Univer-
sity's commitment.
We embrace the boldness and vision in the
guiding principles of carbon neutrality and
zero waste, but the 2025 timeline and the
2006 baseline establish an incremental, not
a visionary, framework. These stated goals
do not capture the true potential of the Uni-
versity; however we are very optimistic about
the ability of the University to surpass the

quantitative targets that it has set for itself.
We encourage you, as the decision-makers,
to always keep the guiding principles in mind
and let their boldness drive and inspire you.
We should monitor global climate change
trends and listen closely to University cli-
mate scientists, realigning our goals periodi-
cally based on the latest data and analyses.
We should collaborate with other bold institu-
tions and strive to surpass them in our pursuit
of sustainability.
Now that you have defined long-term sus-
tainability goals for the University, the Student
Sustainability Initiative is excited to partici-
pate in making these goals a reality. We are
eager to build on recent developments and pur-
sue new initiatives. We thank you for support-
ing the Planet Blue Ambassadors Program,
which has already begun educating University
dorm residents on how they can live more sus-
tainably. We thank you for creating the Planet
Blue Student Innovation Fund, which will pro-
vide $150,000 over three years for large-scale
student projects. Moving forward, we should
pursue similarly bold initiatives: Making recy-
cling and composting available everywhere on
campus, instituting a zero-waste University
football season and creating a functional, sus-
tainable on-campus farm.
Thank you once again for your commitment
to advancing sustainability at the University.
We look forward to continuing our relationship
with you this year and into the future. We are
confident that the University will make great
strides going forward, and we are thrilled to be
a part of this historic commitment to sustain-
ability and social responsibility.
Respectfully,
The Student Sustainability Initiative

Michigan has simple consent
process for bloodspot samples
TO THE DAILY:
The Life Sciences & Society Program at the School
of Public Health thanks The Michigan Daily and
reporter Paige Pearcy for the piece ('U' educates
community on state neonatal blood bank, 10/12/2011)
noting that millions of blood samples from Michi-
gan natives can be used for health research without
explicit consent.
Every Michigander born between July 1, 1984 and
April 30, 2010 has bloodspots in the Michigan Neo-
natal Biobank. Few realize it. LSS aims to let people
know. We'd like to clarify some key details on this
topic around the issue of informed consent.
The Michigan Department of Community of Health
has not banked any blood samples from babies born
after May 2010 without signed, parental permission.
But MDCH is allowed to keep samples collected
from more than 4 million Michiganders born before
last May, even though there was never a process in

place for collecting permission. "Donors" age 18 or
older or the parents of minors can ask MDCH to
destroy or remove their samples from the Biobank.
These Michiganders have the option to opt out, but
they have never had the opportunity to opt in.
For practical reasons, MDCH has not tried to collect
consent for the bloodspots preserved before last May
that represent a potential treasure for researchers.
LSS has created a simple online consent form that
will not impact Michiganders' "participation" in the
Biobank from the state's perspective, but will provide
a way for stakeholders to tell us whether they'd like to
opt in, opt out, state no opinion or be contacted on a
case-by-case basis to say whether they'd allow Univer-
sity researchers, like me, to use their bloodspots.
There are three ways the University community can
participate: Fill out our consent form and find infor-
mation at www.mybloodspot.org; sign up via dbthiel@
umich.edu to pilot-test our website (one hour pays $25
through November) and tell friends.

Beyond sunny 'Days'

Real Estate's latest
release is richer
than summer
By GEOFF MARINO
For the Daily
It's easy to write off Real
Estate as simply another mani-
festation of summery alterna-
tive rock, but
after giving *
the band's new
album, Days, Real Estate
more time
to sink in, it Days
becomes clear
this is a super- Domino
ficial reading of
the New Jersey-based rockers.
Sure, the album's sonic land-
scape is orchestrated with the
hazy bliss of summer in mind
- reverb and overlapping guitar
lines weave expansive collages
that seem born from summer
daydreams. These guys clearly
like to jam. Yet, even though
Days focuses on a summery
theme, Real Estate doesn't nec-
essarily intend to invoke the
bliss of the warmer months.
There is plenty of unease in the
lyrics, and even the rhythmic
structure of the songs disrupts
any conception that this album
is the product of a contented,

lazy summer day.
One of the first tracks, "It's
Real," begins with a stamping
drumbeat that evolves into a less
regimented tempo with layered
guitar lines. This interaction
recalls the structure of the other
tracks on the album, specifically
"Kinder Blumen" and "Three
Blocks." The rhythms initially
store tension, then they release
it into characteristic serenity
and expansiveness. It suggests
the music is cathartic - a great
deal of angst is conjured up and
released.
That angst is especially pal-
pable on "Three Blocks," as the
drowsy depression of a Monday
morning is accentuated by the
scummy reality of the path that
lies outside the safety of a subur-
ban home. This image is followed
by lyrics that more accurately
mirror Real Estate's blissful
orchestration, as singer Martin
Courtney comes to self-realiza-
tion and liberates the tension.
However, the epiphany
doesn't respect natural barriers:
"Endless autumn, under pine
trees, in a springtime spent by
the sea." The band couldn't care
less that autumn and spring can-
not occur simultaneously. And
that's precisely the aim here -
not to care.
Nostalgic themes for a blithe
existence arise throughout

Days. The opening track, "Easy,"
reminisces harmonically about
nature and people in a time when
"We had it so easy / I would sur-
render, completely." On "Green
Aisles," a reflection on that life-
style sums up the motivation
behind Days: "All those wasted
miles / All those aimless drives
through green aisles / A careless
lifestyle / It wasn't so unwise."
The New Jersey suburban-
ites go beyond the warm memo-
ries of lighthearted summers
past, confronting the accepted
"wisdom" that time should be
spent productively. They pursue
every grown-up kid's intellec-
tual dream: to show those who
labeled their revelry a waste that
these experiences aren't regret-
table at all. The last song, "All the
Same," features swaths of word-
less jamming - one can't help but
feel the musicians' pure glee.

just a question of what "gotcha"

Sure it'll make you jump. But that
fear, just like the movie, never
manages to stick.

the movie is limited in its docu-

As the movie follows
Aleichem's entire life, director
Joseph Dorman ("The Endur-
ance") is careful to include con-
text and background information
that make the plotline more com-
pelling. Indeed, some of the most
interesting pieces are descrip-
tions of life in the Jewish com-
munities in Russia before the
start of the pogroms. Eventually,

FEMINIST
From Page1A
roles ... heroes and heroines can
play in our lives," she said.
Fitzgerald said she graduated
from the University at a time
of political turmoil and female
empowerment through the
women's rights movement. Dur-
ing her time at the University,
females were accepted into the
Michigan Marching Band for the
first time and the University cre-
ated the Department of Women's
Studies.
"My college years were a very
empowering time when I was
here on campus," Fitzgerald said.
Though the Bentley Histori-
cal Library opened on campus
shortly after she graduated,
Fitzgerald said she knew Peter-
son's papers - correspondences
between Peterson and family
members when she was work-
ing with the Red Cross in Europe
during World War II - were
housed there, which gave her
an excuse to return to campus
while researching for her book.
Fitzgerald praised the "wonder-
ful staff" and "beautiful setting
of the library" and said it was an

important place for her to find
information on Peterson's past.
Fitzgerald lauded Peterson's
perseverance to enter a male-
dominated field. She told the
audience that as Peterson waited
to formally accept her position
as Michigan Republican Party
chair in February 1965, Max
Fisher, the party's finance chair,
informed her that her salary
would be lower than her prede-
cessor because she was a woman.
Despite the skepticism she
received from co-workers and
the public because of her gender,
Fitzgerald said Peterson contin-
ued to advance her career and
became the assistant chair of the
Republican National Committee
in 1970.
"I think (Peterson is) someone
who obviously, when I was the
age of a student, was a role model
for me," Fitzgerald said. "And I
think it's important that stories
like hers don't get lost along the
way because I think she stood for
a lot of values that are still very
important and sadly often not in
our politics today."
Fitzgerald added that stories
regarding Peterson's progress
through the political ranks were
restricted to the women's section

of newspapers until 1971 when
women's affairs were covered
more often.
Lawrence Lindemer, a former
Michigan Supreme Court justice
who previously served as chair of
the Michigan Republican Party
when Peterson was his secre-
tary in 1957, attended last night's
event. Lindemer also served on
the University's Board of Regents
from 1969 to 1975 while Fitzger-
ald attended the University. Inan
interview after the event, Linde-
mer praised Peterson's work and
said she was an influential per-
son through her work in politics.
"She was one hell of a woman
and one hell of a person," Linde-
mer said.
Closing her talk, Fitzgerald
read a portion of one of Peter-
son's speeches that discussed
increasing governmental tol-
erance with more women and
minorities entering politics.
"In diversity, there is strength
for us as a party. As a commu-
nity, as a nation and in our toler-
ance and fairness to others, lies
the path to being the rational
human beings we all aspire to
be," Fitzgerald read. "May we all
find our way graciously and pas-
sionately down this path."

LIBYA
From Page 1A
(United Nations) have some expe-
rience in the past."
Various news sources have
broadcasted videos of Gadhafi
while wounded and being taken
away from Sirte in the bed of a
pickup truck. While many have
celebrated his death, Levitsky said
there is no point "expressing great
joy" overGadhafi's death. Levitsky
added that with the small triumph
comes great difficulty.
"What we need to do is move
on from here," he said.
Mark Tessler, the University's
vice provost for international
affairs and a professor of politi-
cal science, said Libya has tough
times ahead.
'Tessler added that it would be
incorrect to attribute the coun-

try's victory to NATO alone since
the Libyan people have actively
participated in their own revo-
lution and are now dealing with
establishing a new and unified
government.
"To have a government that is
effective, to have a kind of nation-
al coherence and a national iden-
tity that really means something
- these are all things that Libya
wants and should have and has the
opportunity to have," Tessler said.
LSA senior Aisha Malek lived
in Libya from 2003 to 2005 and
said Gadhafi's death means "a
new start" for Libyans. Malek's
father immigrated to the U.S. to
attend college when he was 17
years old, but years later brought
his wife and four children back to
what Malek remembers as a con-
strained nation. Much of Malek's
extended family still lives in the
country.

."There is no freedom - well
there wasn't," Malek said. "I guess
now things are changing, but
there was really no freedom of
speech at all."
Malek recalled that when she
and her family first arrived in
Libya, her younger sister asked
her uncle what he thought about
Gadhafi. Her uncle was shocked
that she had even asked and told
her to never speak of the dictator
again.
"The rebel forces have kind of
had control for a couple of months
now," Malek said. "But I think
now that he's been captured and
he's dead, too, that it finally means
that it's over - that 42 years of
just a terrible oppressive regime
that people suffered under, that
people were killed under."
- The Associated Press
contributed to this report.



DINING
From Page 1A
ware are instead factored into the
operating budget for University
dining facilities.
"It's more of a nuisance, really,
than anything else because it
essentially takes plates and cups
away from the students who are
trying to use the dining facili-
ties," Logan said.
Though University Housing
doesn't keep track of how many
pieces of dining ware go missing
- whether they are stolen, dam-
aged or accidentally disposed
of - the University spent about
$40,000 last fiscal year to replace
and add necessary pieces. How-
ever, since University Housing
operations are funded by student
room and board rates, Logan
wrote in an e-mail that students
are indirectly paying for the lost
dining pieces.
"The replacement cost of din-
ing wares is not a major expense,
but if you divvy up $40,000
among the 11,000 students with
meal plans, it puts it in a personal
perspective," Logan wrote. "Tak-

ing a cup or a plate or a bowl is
part of that ... it costs everyone."
Business junior Hiral Pithad-
ia said his current off-campus
house contains a fair amount
of dishware and other supplies
that he and his housemates have
acquired from the dining halls.
Pithadia said he always believed
that the University charged an
additional fee to student tuition
or room and board rates to make
up for missing dishware.
"For as long as I lived in the
(residence) halls, I felt that it was
appropriate to, kind of, borrow
some things fromthere,"Pithadia
said, adding that he does not con-
sider himself a thief for taking
cutlery and dishware.
An LSA freshman who wished
to remain anonymous said he
has taken dining ware back to
his room in East Quad Residence
Hall as needed, but always with
the intent of returning it at the
end of the year in the collection
boxes provided by Housing staff.
"I'm not doing it with the intent
ofnever giving it back,"he said. "If
I need a spoon or a fork or a bowl
to eat cereal, I'll take one ... I'll
bringit back at some later date."

The LSA freshman also
described pilfering dining ware
as "getting even" due to the high
cost of tuition and room and
board.
"As tuition gets higher and
higher, what's a few forks worth?"
he said.
Pithadia expressed this same
feeling of retribution and said he
justifies stealing dishes because
of the amount students are
charged per meal, since he can
find cheaper options outside the
dining halls.
The meal plans that include
125 and 150 meals per semester
are factored into students' room
and board, while meal plans with
more meals are available at an
additional cost ranging from $135
to $530. For students not living
in the residence halls, meal plans
cost between $1,110 for 50 meals
and 500 blue bucks per semester
to $2,390 for the unlimited plus
plan.
"Although there might not be a
pure title to an expense for theft
or losing objects from the dining
hall, I feel like they might just
compensate for it by over-pricing
meals," Pithadia said.

SOLAR CAR
From Page 1A
three leading teams were neck and
neck despite various challenges,
according to Rackham student
Caitlin Sadler, a spokeswoman for
the University's team. Among the
difficulties was a brushfire that
stopped the race for half a day.
"All the teams had to stop and
spend the night wherever they
were," Sadler said.
The car, named Quantum, is
16 feet feet long and 37 inches in
height. It weighs 200 pounds less
than the team's previous model,
the 520-pound Infinium, estab-
lishing itself as the most aerody-
namic car produced by the team
to date.

Solar car driver Troy Halm, a
junior in the College of Engineer-
ing, said in a Michigan Engineering
video of the team in Australia that
he is proud of the team's finish.
"I'm feeling very good, very,
very happy the race is over, and I'm
relieved," Halm said. "I'm happy
with how we finished - not first -
but it's third, and we finished the
race, which is still excellent."
Halm also pointed to the brush-
fire as a challenge among others.
"We had a pretty interesting
last 100 kilometers," he said. "The
battery dropped a lot lower than
we expected, so we had to go pret-
ty slow."
Engineering and LSA senior
Rachel Kramer, another member
of the Solar Car Team, said in the
video that she had "mixed emo-

tions" about the team's finish.
"It's a lot of pride in first getting
ourselves here and then in com-
pleting the race, but also a little bit
of disappointment. I think every-
one is feeling that now," Kramer
said. "We came here to get more
than third and ended up with
third again. It's kind of our third
place curse."
But team members here in Ann
Arbor are already looking to the
future and are preparing for the
2013 competition.
"The team at home is always
focused on that two-year cycle,"
Sadler said. "We're already work-
ing on the 2013 car, and what it's
going to look like and they're also
going to prepare for the American
Solar Challenge, which is raced
this upcoming summer."

Wolverines work to fill Veronica Hicks's spot

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
When guard Veronica Hicks
graduated last season, the Mich-
igan women's basketball team
lost more than its leading scorer.
As the Wolverines' lone
senior, Hicks was a vocal leader
on and off the court. She also led
the team in total rebounds for
the season.
"I don't think necessarily one
person can sit there and say, 'I'm
going to take Veronica Hicks's
spot' because she did so much
on the floor," said senior guard
Courtney Boylan at Michigan
Media Day last week.
For her prolific performance
last season, Hicks was named
team MVP at the postseason
banquet.
But the Wolverines have a
returning group of players who
hope to make up for any talent
lost with Hicks.
"Veronica was a great player,
but we have been practicing a lot
without her," said junior forward
Rachel Scheffer. "We all just
need to take it upon ourselves to
replace her individually and rely
on each other."
Scheffer averaged 11 points
per game, just a hair fewer than
Hicks's 11.2 average, and sopho-
more Jenny Ryan tallied 151
rebounds - just 13 fewer than
Hicks. Scheffer and Ryan are
two of four returning starters
who will lead Michigan this sea-

son.
Joining them are junior for-
ward Nya Jordan and senior
guard/forward Carmen Reyn-
olds. Jordan started the first 13
games but suffered a season-
ending knee injury and Reynolds
started all 30 games last season.
As upperclassmen, both players
will have leadership roles.
Along with the returning
players, Michigan also welcomes
four new freshmen. Two of them
- guard Brenae Harris and for-
ward Cyesha Goree - could have
an immediate impact.
"With the freshmen com-
ing in everyone has their areas
to piece together with what we
miss from losing Veronica," said
senior guard Jamillya Hardley.
"I think if we work together and
keep that team cohesiveness, we
can definitely make up for what
was lost."
Goree is predominantly a
post player, and Harris excels at
guard. Both were top recruits
who signed in November of last
year.
"In my opinion, Cyesha Goree
is going to be a really good play-
er," Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth said. "If you need a tight end
or some hands that's going to
catch it, throw it to Cyesha. What
a phenomenal set of hands."
After receiving the letters of
intent, Borseth noted Harris's
versatility.
"She can get to the rim, dis-
tribute or knock down the arc

Senior point guard Courtney Boylan has an increased leadership role in 2011.

shot," Borseth said in November
2010 when Harris committed.
"She's probably alot like a Veron-
ica Hicks type of a player, and
since Veronica will be graduat-
ing after this year, Brenae (Har-
ris) will have some big shoes to
fill, and we are glad she'll be here
to do so."
As a guard, Harris will be
able to study under the likes of
Boylan, Ryan and Reynolds.
Borseth runs a simple yet flex-
ible offense that should allow the
freshmen to catch on quickly.
He utilizes the ball-screen on
offense to give his players open
shots, and by spreading the

floor, he allows all five players to
rebound.
"The great thing about coach
Borseth's system is he just allows
you to play," Boylan said. "He
wants to putyou in positions that
will keep you spaced on the floor,
but what's great aboutit is there's
not really set plays, and he allows
you to play the game that you've
always played."
With Hicks gone this year, the
four returning starters will give
the Wolverines a solid base.
"I think we're a team - in
every sense of the word - with-
out asuperstar, waitingfor some-
one to emerge," Borseth said.

CCHA CONTENDERS

Notre Dame
Early on, the Fighting Irish were
a popular pick to contend for the
CCHA crown and the national title.
But a rocky first two weeks, albeit
against tough competition, has left
Notre Dame at.500.
Last year's Irish team was sig-
nificantly improved from 2009-10
when it finished 13-17-8. In 2010,
Notre Dame led the CCHA for much
of the season before relinquishing
the conference lead during the final
weekend to Michigan.
Having lost just five players to
graduation, experience shouldn't
be an issue. Goaltending wasn't
expected to be an issue either, but
the tandem of junior Mike Johnson
and sophomore Steven Summer-
hays hasn't exactly been impen-
etrable thus far. Summerhays is
allowing4.61 goals pergame.
With a new arena coming to
South Bend, seventh-year coach
Jeff Jackson will attemptsto maneu-
ver through a trying schedule and
live up to the preseason hype sur-
rounding the program.
FIRST LOOK: Michigan at Notre
Dame, Jan. 20-21.

Miami (Ohio)
Known simply as "The Dynasty"
to some, don't expect the 2011 ver-
sion of the RedHawks to deviate
from what has become a norm of
success. Head coach Enrico Blasi
returns for his 13th season at the
helm of his alma mater.
Miami hopes to alleviate linger-
ing memories from a devastating
end to an otherwise spectacular
last season. The RedHawks were
sent packing in the first round of
the NCAA Tournament against
New Hampshire, a heavy underdog.
Meanwhile, forward Andy Miele
became the program's first Hobey
Baker Award winner. A sharp
recruiting class coming to Oxford is
led by forward Tyler Biggs, arguably
the nation's most prized incoming
talent. Biggs is no misnomer for the
freshman, whose size will present
problems into the postseason for
opposing teams. Combined with
forward Reilly Smith, who has an
uncanny knack for finding the net,
this will be one of Blasi's highest-
scoringteams in recent memory.
FIRST LOOK: Michigan at Miami,
Nov.11-12.

Alaska Fairbanks
The CCHA's version of the far
West is coming off a disappoint-
ing 2010, marred by a 4-10-3 away
record. And while travel fatigue is
to be expected for the Nanooks, it's
something they need to get used
to - the 49th state isn't getting any
closer to the CCHA's Midwestern
teams. On the contrary, the Carl-
son Center is a notoriously difficult
place to play in, as opponents some-
times have trouble adjusting.
Alaska has a gem of a netminder
in senior Scott Greenham. He's
off to an impressive start to 2011,
allowing 1.67 goals per game. His
timely saves were critical in key-
ing a 4-1 Nanook win over No. 14
Nebraska-Omaha last weekend.
Anchoring Alaska in the middle
is Nik Yaremchuk, a fan favorite
in Fairbanks who always seems to
have the puck in opportune spots on
the ice. If the Nanooks want a shot
at the CCHA title - and it would be
an outside shot at best - they must
win its home contests and steal ones
from contest foes on the road.
FIRST LOOK: Michigan at Alas-
ka, Dec. 2-3.

Western Michigan
The coaching position in
Kalamazoo has been a whirlwind
of late, but it seems the Broncos
may have found a diamond in the
rough in Andy Murray. Murray
was brought in this summer to
replace Jeff Blashill, who jumped
ship after one year at Western
to join the Detroit Red Wings'
coaching staff. The Broncos lost
their top scorer in Max Campbell,
but the next nine are back. Sopho-
more forward Shane Berschbach
is off to a hot start, scoring three
times in his first two games.
Between the pipes, Murray has
yet to give the starting nod to any
of his three goaltenders. In the
latest recruiting class, Western
has two netminders who seem
capable of earning playing time
this season.
With their first NCAA Tourna-
ment appearance in 15 years last
season, the Broncos will have to
adjust to their new coach quickly
if another at-large bid is in the
cards for Western.
FIRST LOOK: Michigan vs.
Western Michigan, Nov. 4-5.

Ferris State
If there's ever a season for the
Bulldogs to play with the big boys in
the CCHA, it's this one.
Center Travis Ouellette, last
year's leading scorer, will need to
play an even bigger role for the pro-
gram's first NCAA Tournament
appearance since 2003 - and sec-
ond ever - to be more than a pipe
dream.
Speaking of pipes, between them
will be C.J. Motte and Taylor Nel-
son. While it would seem tenured
head coach Bob Daniels will need to
select one eventually, the by-com-
mittee system has been good to the
Bulldogs, as they have started the
2011-12 season with a perfect 4-0
record.
Ferris State is almost as young as
Michigan, with seven freshmen on
its roster to the Wolverines' eight
freshmen.
Although a conference title still
feels like a stretch, 2011 represents
the Bulldogs' opportunity to take
their licks, but dish some of their
own out too.
FIRST LOOK: Michigan vs. Ferris
State, Oct. 27-28.

tion. Shawn is now the grizzled veteran in the net, trying to
deliver the fairy tale for Michigan.
You would think that the most important position on the
current top-ranked team in the country would be filled by a
highly touted player, or at least someone who was recruited
heavily. Some sort of a plan for the position, at the very least.
You'd be wrong.
The special thing about Shawn's journey is that no one
predicted it. Not Berenson, not Rich and Robin, not Matt.
Even Shawn didn't imagine things working out this way.
You can only dream so big.
This happening at a storied program with some of the best
recruiting in the nation is inexplicable. How does a player
who stumbles onto the team land himself atop Michigan's
all-time goals against average an, save percentage?
"As a coach, it just shows you - we don't know every-
thing," Berenson said. "You don't know everything about
your players, you don't know what's inside akid and you don't
know what the possibilities are."
Shawn is one of the players who lights the old coach's eyes
up. Berenson could seemingly go on for hours on end about
him.
Shawn went to El Salvador this summer, building a school
for children for more than a week. He played soccer with the
kids, not hockey, and didn't even bring a puck.
He didn't go for the publicity or for Michigan; he went

one bit by success does. He isn't concerned
about going to the NHL, and he understands
Michigan might be his career highlight.
He's never felt entitled. So he lets back-
up goaltender Adam Janecyk get minutes
because he knows how it feels to never get in
a game.
He credits everybody but himself for shut-
outs, no matter how many saves he had.
And perhaps most importantly, he under-
stands how unbelievable his journey has
been.-
When you watch Shawn's ESPN documen-
tary in 10 years, just remember his passion.
He cares about Michigan hockey, even if --
Michigan hockey originally didn't care about
him.
"You just need to prepare yourself to get to
a threshold, that if you are given the opportu-
nity then you can succeed," Shawn said. "You
just have to wait for a break." FILE PHOTO/Daily

Berenson was placing his record-breaking legacy on the
shoulders on a 5-foot-6 walk-on that wasn't recruited by
any Division-I program.
Want to make Berenson smile? Bring up the 2010 tour-
nament run.
In a storyline that Disney would throw out for being far
too unrealistic, Shawn and the Wolverines kept the playoff
streak alive by winning the CCHA tournament. This was
no cupcake schedule.
They swept No. 11 Michigan State in East Lansing, beat
No. 2 Miami (Ohio) at Joe Louis Arena, and then capped
it off with a 2-1 win over No. 12 Northern Michigan in the
final.
After losing Shawn's first start to Notre Dame, Michigan
reeled off seven victories ina row.
Shawn allowed just seven goals in four games.
"I can't tell you whether it was because of goalkeeping
or luck or chemistry or what it was, butI can tell you when
Hogan got hurt and our captain Chris Summers got hurt,
our team took off after that," Berenson said. "I think every-
one got on the right page at the right time, and this team
took off. We were as good as anyone at the end."
The team got within a goal of the Frozen Four, but lost to
the RedHawks 3-2 in double overtime of the NCAA tourna-
ment regional final in Fort Wayne, Ind.
During spring meetings after the season, Berenson told
Hogan and Shawn they were going to split time in the 2010-
11 season. Shawn would go on Fridays and Hogan would go
on Saturdays.
"Itwas the firsttime in mycareerthat knowing, working
out in the summertime, that I was going to geta chance to
play in games," Shawn said. "It was a huge motivation each
day to go work out and run, skate and all that stuff knowing
that you will get a chance to play, instead of just hoping to
play."
He also worked out with Matt and other former Wol-
verines that summer. Matt had just finished up his third
season with the Boston Bruins, and Shawn was able to pick
up a lot from his brother. They were back on the pond, one
brother trying to score on another.
"It helped him not only physically but mentally know-
ing that his confidence grew, becoming better and better,"
Matt said. "He saw he could compete against some of the
top players in college hockey."
There was much debate as to who should start, but
Berenson wanted to give both his netminders a chance

and have someone emerge as the starter before Christmas.
After 19 games, it wasn't Shawn.
The last game before Christmas was the Big Chill at the
Big House. The Wolverines had struggled in Friday night
games all year, maybe because of Shawn but maybe because
of the team. Shawn was by no means running away with
the job.
"I definitely was way too nervous and worried about
Hogan way too much, how the team was playing in front of
him and how they were playing in front of me," Shawn said.
"It was hard for me just to concentrate on the game at hand.
It was tough because I put too much pressure on myself."
The Big Chill was scheduled to be Shawn's start, but
Berenson decided to skip it and start Hogan in one of the
biggest games in the history of Michigan hockey. The num-
bers didn't lie - Hogan was 7-2-1 going into the game, and
Shawn was 2-3-4.
The dream was beginning to come toa close.
"When you get skipped over to go with the other guy, the
writing is pretty much on the wall," Shawn said. "The big-
gest game of the year, you are going to go with your best
goalie or who you think your best goalie is."
Shawn had about 40 family members come to the game,
and because he wasn't starting, he was able to enjoy him-
self - at least for a little while.
"I just got this feeling, like I got nervous," Shawn said. "I
wasjustlike, 'Oh crap, if Hogangets hurtI amgoingto have
to play, I better start getting ready.' I started getting ready
like I was goingto play, and I think that actually helped me
prepare. There was no excuse for not being ready."
Still, Hogan was starting and went through most of the
warmups ready to play.
Butthenonewrongtwistchanged Shawn's fate - Hogan
had pulled his other groin during warmups. The presumed
starter hobbled off the ice once again, putting Shawn in
front of the largest crowd ever to watch a hockey game.
The walk-on third goalie was starting in the biggest
stage on the history of college hockey. No one knew until
the puck dropped.
"We got there and someone told us Shawn was in net
and we were like, 'Yeah right, OK, go have another beer,' "
Robin said. "All of a sudden you look down and there he
was, between the pipes."
Shawn sat in the locker room after warmups, trying not
to think too hard about the task ahead. He led the team out
of the tunnel and became the first Michigan hockey player
to slap the famed 'Go Blue' banner.
Shawn then proceeded to shut out Michigan State 5-0
amid the fireworks, music and thunderous noise that
113,411 people can make.
He recorded 34 saves with the
wind whippinginhis face, includ-
, QS ing 14 in the final period. The
puck was simply not going to get
past him.
_ He went from expecting to
never play in a single game to
shutting out one of Michigan's
biggest rivals in a highly antici-
pated spectacle of a match-up.
"It was literally one of the best
days of my life," Shawn said. "Its
hard to put it in words how much
it means."
Again, Shawn expected Hogan
to come back the next week and
claim the starting spot. But again,
Hogan's injury was more serious
than expected. He would miss
almost two months, and by that
time, Shawn had entrenched him-
ADAM SCHNITZER/Daily self in the starting role.
me in Sterling Heights. With Shawn at the helm, the

Wolverines finished the season on a 16-4 run en route to a
21st consecutive appearance in the NCAA tournament. On
paper, they weren't one of the best teams in the country, but
they sure as hell played like it.
Shawn made Berenson look like the smartest coach on
the planet.
After breezing through the NCAA West Regional Final
in St. Louis, Michigan headed to the Frozen Four in St. Paul,
Minn.
Shawn playedarguably the best game of his career against
No. 1 North Dakota in the national semifinal, recording 40
saves in a shutout of the potent Fighting Sioux. The nextday,
five North Dakota players joined professional teams.
This goalie could pass as a high school student. But
instead, he was playing the most important position on the
Michigan hockey team.
And he recorded 40 saves against the best team in the
country.
"I wouldn't have dreamt it," Berenson said. "I remember
we were talking before the national championship game,
and I was saying, 'Who would have thought that we just beat
maybe the best team in the country, North Dakota, essen-
tially ina road game, and Shawn Hunwick was the reason?'
"It's the real deal because he played and took our team
right to the National Championship by saving 40 shots. It
wasn't like we had a powerhouse of a team."
April 9, 2011 was the biggest day of Shawn Hunwick's life.
He was starting the National Championship game against
Minnesota-Duluththatnight. Itwasthe onlyoneofShawn's
collegiate games that Matt attended.
And it was Shawn's birthday.
The contest was tied at the end of regulation, 2-2, with
both teams battling for their lives. But for Michigan, the
extra period had a feeling of destiny - the last two Michigan
championship teams both won 3-2.
Sometimes you have to be reminded Shawn's story isn't
a fairytale.
Early in the extra period, Bulldog forward Kyle Schmidt
slashed through a tired Michigan defense, picked up a feed
in front of the net and beat Shawn glove-side.
Game, season, storybook ending all gone in an instant.
"It would have been a fairy tale." Shawn said. "Not
expecting to play at all and then playing in the national
championship on your birthday.
"It would have been unbelievable."
He still doesn't like talking about it.
"I still think about it all the time," Shawn said. "Every
time you lace up your skates, you think, 'I could be anational
champion,' but you're not. It's hard to get over.
"Itdefinitelyhad the fairy-tale story, it had the beginning
and the middle, it just didn't have the end."
But every so often, he lets himself remember what could
have been.
"If you watch the YouTube video of that last goal, it prob-
ably has 500 views and 450 are probably from me," he said.
"I try not to watch it anymore now that we are in season, but
in the summertime, I watched it countless times.
"It's difficult. You don't really expect a run like that, and
when you get there ... once you get there and you are that
close, when you are one shot away, when you are one bounce
away from winning...you never know if you are goingto get
back. So that's your motivation. Eventually you have to move
on."
This season, for the first time in his Michigan career,
Shawn is the guy. No more splitting time, no more looking
behind his shoulder, no more worrying about the competi-

At the sign-ups, Shawn saw these little goalie pads in the
corner of the room, and that was it. Rich did his best to talk
him into another position, but Shawn was having none of it.
He wanted to be a goalie.
This whole journey - this story - it all started because a
little boy saw some oversized goalie pads and thought they
looked cool.
As kids cycled through positions while experimenting
with the sport, Shawn was in net. He played without those
oversized pads in the offensive zone a few times and hated
it. Out there, you have to return to the bench every once in
a while. Shawn didn't like coming out. He was content with
never taking a breather.
It didn't hurt that he had an older brother who was will-
ingto shoot on him for hours and hours, either. Shots to the
head didn't faze him - they were just part of the game. He
wasn't scared of anything.
Shawn enjoyed the pressure, too. He liked that the team
relied on him and that not everyone could do his job. Goalie
might be the most important position in any team of any
sport. Something about that drew Shawn in.
"If you are a forward, you can probably take a night off
without anyone noticing that you didn't play that well,"
Shawn said. "When you are a goalie you can'treally do that.
If I take a night off we are going to lose the game."
He could have switched positions when he stopped
growing, but he knew he was a goalie. Tall, short, or in
between, no one could take that away from him. They tried,
but the little kid who had been blocking shots his whole life
just blocked that one too.
Nobody doubted the kid was a hell of a goalie. He had a
knack for knowing where the puck was going, even at an
early age.
In one youth tournament he played in, the most valuable
player of each game received the puck. Shawn received a
puck almost every game, even though his team didn't win
a single time.
"The pucks just kept coming in," Robin said. "Every time
he turned around they were giving Shawn the puck."
By then, the Hunwick boys were devoting every wak-
ing moment to hockey. They played every sport and joined
every group, but all other activities fell into place around
hockey.
"We would have a day off and he would be like, 'I'm
bored, we don't do anything,' " Rich said. "I would always
say, 'What the hell are you talking about? We've been going
21 days in a row!'"
The United States Developmental Teamshowed no inter-
est in Shawn, even after Matt played on the team two years
before. The team is a Michigan hockey pipeline, and sends
players to other top schools as well. Undeterred, Shawn fin-
ished high school and started playing junior hockey.
He played for the Petrolia Jets of the Western Ontario
Junior Hockey League (WOJHL) at age 18, where he won
the WOJHL Rookie Goalie of the year award. The team
finished in ninth place the year before he joined and the
year after he left. When Shawn was there, the Jets finished
fourth.
He still didn't warrant significant interest from colleges,
so he joined the Alpena IceDiggers of the North American
Hockey League (NAHL). The IceDiggers were in Alpena
for five years, and when Shawn was on the team in 2007,
they finished with their best record in team history.
Yes, he was short, but he was also talented with an
impressive track record. Success followed him anywhere
he went. Still, colleges didn't care.
"He didn't come up the easy way," Berenson said.
Shawn committed to Adrian College in the summer of
2007; his parents even sent money to the school for Shawn's

housing. But everything changed when
Steve Jakiel decided to leave Michigan
for Curry College.
All of a sudden, Berenson needed a
third goalie.
Then-Wolverines Chad Kolarik and
Kevin Porter approached the coach
about bringing Shawn aboard, and
Berenson eventually agreed. He knew
the Hunwick family because of Matt
and had seen Shawn at a few tourna-
ments, so he knew he was getting an
undersized, but quality individual in
Shawn.
For comparison's sake, Jakiel is
6-foot-4 - the Berenson prototype.
There isn't much risk with a third
goalie. He sits on the end of the bench,
doesn't get much time at practice and
isn't expected to do much. Shawn
wasn't going to play, so if Berenson
didn't like him he could get rid of him
easily. Shawn Hunwick lo
"I told him if he were to come here he
would have to be a great teammate, work
hard at practice and push the other goalies," Berenson said.
"Being the third goalie is a very difficult role to play."
It wasn't even a decision for Shawn. He accepted the
offer immediately.
"I think Shawn would have wanted to go to Michigan
even if he wasn't on the team," Robin said. "He just wanted
to be there. Even if he didn't get to play, he still thought it
was a good experience for him, a good fit."
He would have been one of Adrian's best players imme-
diately, but he wanted nothing more than to become a
Wolverine. He would be a glorified practice player, but he
would be a Michigan practice player. That was the only
thing that mattered.
"I think a lot of people that we knew didn't necessarily
like the decision," Matt said.
Shawn's first two years at Michigan played out exactly
how they were supposed to. He sat on the bench and did
everything he could to be a good teammate. Berenson loved
him in the locker room, but Shawn never got a shot at play-
ing time.
He played in one game his freshman year, tallying two
saves in three minutes in a 10-1 Michigan victory.
During his sophomore season, he didn't appear in a sin-
gle game.
"There were days and weeks where I thought I could
play, and there were days and weeks and months where I
didn't think I would play," Shawn said. "I was improving
in practice, but it was hard to be consistent when you aren't
geared up to play. It's easyto take days off and all that stuff,
especially when you get into January and February and you
still aren't playing. In the back of my mind, I just wanted to
work hard."
He would go on the ice 45 minutes before practice
everyday for an individual workout with goalie coach Josh
Blackburn. Billy Sauer and Brian Hogan were splitting time
during games and practices, so Shawn didn't see much time
in the net during practice.
There was no imminent reward of playing time. But
Shawn never called home and complained. Not once.
The thought of leaving the team never even crossed his
mind. Ask him about giving up, and you geta look of pure,
unrestrained confusion. Quitting? What's that?
"I never grew tired of the program," Shawn said. "I
couldn't really be disappointed because I came in knowing
this is what I was going to be, the third goalie."

oks on in disbelief after Michigan lost the National Championship.
But third goalie turned to second when Sauer graduat-
ed. And second became first on senior night against Notre
Dame.
The night before the Notre Dame game, Shawn told
himself he was never going to start a game in a Michigan
uniform. Hogan would be returning for his senior season,
which would essentially eliminate Shawn's shot.
For Shawn, one day made all the difference.
If you wanted to map out the early career of Shawn Hun-
wick and then do the exact opposite, Bryan Hogan would
be your prototype. Heavily recruited and 6-foot-1, Hogan
played significant minutes in his first two years at Michi-
gan in front of Shawn. By the start of his junior year in
2009, Hogan had won the starting job outright.
But the season was not going well for the Wolverines.
Entering the final series of the year against Notre Dame,
the Wolverines were 18-16-1 and in 7th place in the CCHA.
For the first time in 20 years, Michigan was not going to
make the NCAA tournament.
Eleven minutes into senior night, Hogan suffered a groin
injury and had to leave the game. Making just his second
appearance of the season, the important game was put into
the hands of the goalie nobody wanted.
Shawn stepped in and made 14 saves en route to a 4-0
shutout of the Fighting Irish.
"My only thought was that I don't want to ruin senior
night for these guys," Shawn said. "You only get one senior
night, and I don't to be the reason we lose to Notre Dame."
Shawn started the next night against Notre Dame and
lost the first start of his career, 5-3. He figured he'd be right
back on the bench when Hogan returned for the CCHA
tournament.
But it turns out Hogan's injury was more serious than
expected. When you spend the whole game crouching and
diving and stretching, the groin needs to be fully function-
al.
And after almost three years, the kid that never gave up
finally got his shot.
In order to keep the NCAA tournament streak alive,
Michigan would have to win the CCHA tournament as a
No. 7 seed. No team in the history of the conference had
ever done that.
And the last time Michigan didn't make the tournament,
Ice Ice Baby was a No. 1 single and Space Jam was making
its debut.

As Berenson said, "These early

The same is true for early
rankings. It's certainly good to
be ranked No. 1, but it's not a real

Just ask the 2005 team. After its
No. 1 ranking, it finished third in

It finished outside the top 10.
That's the only ranking that mat-
