By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily Staff Reporter
At their first meeting of the
academic year this Thursday, the
University's Board of Regents is
expected to vote on more than
$180 million in capital projects
reiated to varsity and intramurai
athietics.
The board wiii consider the con-
struction of a $168 million South
Campus athletic facility and a $18.7
million renovation of the Univer-
sity's Intramural Sports Building.

Campus projectbegins
Pending approvalby the regents,
the University will construct a
310,000 square-foot space to serve
student-athletes involved with
the Michigan men and women's
tracks and field, cross country,
soccer, lacrosse, wrestling, tennis,
gymnastics and women's rowing

teams.
The facility will include an out-
door track venue fit for 2,000 spec-
tators and an indoor track facility
that can accommodate 1,000 fans.
An outdoor lacrosse stadium
planned for the site is expected to
house 3,000 spectators,
The facility will include
shared performance space, locker
rooms, strength and conditioning
facilities, meeting space and
sports medicine facilities. When
completed, the space is expected
to host national, regional and local
competitions but will be also be
available for recreational use.
The project is largely funded
through a -$100 million gift from
real estate tycoon Stephen Ross,
a University alum, along with
Athletic Department Resources.
Last fall, Ross donated $200
million to the University's Athletic
Department and the Ross School
of Business, giving each unit
$100 million. Ross was made the
business school's namesake in
2004 when he donated his first
$100 million to help renovate the
school's facilities.
The recent $200 million gift is
the largest single donation to the
University to date, and at their

Inclusive Language,
campaign serves
to improve
campus climate
By CHARLOTTE JENKINS
Daily Staff Reporter
Monday, the University's
Expect Respect initiative offi-
cially launched the Inclusive

Language campaign in the
Michigan Union. Both the kick-
off event and the campaign aim
to raise awareness about the
power of language in everyday
discourse on campus.
Amanda McLittle, coordina-
tor of Diversity Education in
University Housing, said given
incidents like Theta Xi's "Hood
Ratchet" party and the Black
Student Union's #BBUM Twit-
ter campaign last year, the Uni-
versity created the program to

help improve campus climate
and understanding.
"We don't talk enough about
how our language and the
words that we use, and how
they impact others," McLittle
said. "Last year's events
showed that this has always
been needed."
The campaign aims to
educate students about hurtful
phrases that are not inclusive
and eliminate language that
perpetuates hate and prejudice.

The words and phrases included
in a pamphlet distributed at the
event included statements that
were heard on campus.
ILC materials referenced
phrases like "I want to die,"
and "that's so gay." The former,
according to the pamphlet,
belittles those who have self-
harmed or attempted suicide
by implying that their struggle
is laughable or insignificant.
Phrases like "that's so gay"

The Ann Arbor City Council
is joining Washtenaw County in
expediting the creation of a new
revenue stream action to fix the
city's roads,
At Monday's City Council
meeting, Councilmember
Christopher Taylor (D-Ward

mayor, proposed a resolution
in support of a county proposal
to levy a 0,5-mill tax for the
improvement of existing roads

examines trials of

By EMILIE PLESSET
who has this position
Tightly packed between
stacks of colorful books, about
SO University students and
members of the Ann Arbor
community shuffled into Lite-
rati Bookstore Mondayevening
to hear two cancer-surviving
authors tell their stories fea-
tured in the recently published
book Chronicling Childhood
Cancer: A Collection of Per-
sonal Stories by Children and
Teens with Cancer.

The book was edited and
compiled by Medical student
Trisha Paul as part of her
Honors English thesis last
semester as she wrapped
up her undergraduate work
before applying to medical
school, It told the stories of 10
children and teens between
the ages of S and 18 through
narratives, journal entries,
lists and personal drawings.
Two of these children were
Ruben and Celestewho shared
their stories at the event.
"At its core, this project has
been a way for me to learn
more about what humanity is,"
Paul said. "To learn more about
how we act as people and how
to treat other people."
The event honored Sep-
tember as Childhood Cancer
Awareness Month and donat-

ed 50 percent of the book's
proceeds to the University's
"Block Out Cancer" campaign,
and the other 50 percent to the
Child and Family Life Program
at the University of Michigan
C.S. Mott Children's Hospital.
Literati co-owner Mike
Gustafson, an Ann Arbor
resident said that while the
bookstore has held events in
the past where portions of the
sales were donated to charity,
this was the first event where
all the proceeds were to be
donated.
Literati's owners felt the
emotional nature of the book
would have a big impact on its
readers, and made it a good
candidate for a charity event.

PROFESSOR BETH GENNE
Studying the legacy of Fred Astaire

Beth Genned is a professor of
Dance and Art History and spe-
cializes in 20th century Ameri-
can and European ballet as well
as dance in American cinema.
Her upcoming book will focus on
the contributions of Fred Astaire
and Gene Kelly to the evolution of
dance in American musicalfilms.
Whatinspired you topursue
your field of study?
I absolutely adore visual arts
and dance and music, as well and
film. I just research things I love
to look at. I just love my subject,
I feel like I'm really lucky to be
studying things I really, really
love.

Is there a specific artistic
genre that you like to
specializein?
Right now I'm writing a book
about dance and film musi-
cal, specifically on Fred Astaire
and Gene Kelly. I love the genre
of American dance that both
Astaire and Kelly do. I think it
deserves more careful placement
in the history of dance and music.
One of my other great interests
is the choreographer George
Balanchine. He created some of
the most extraordinary modern
dance; I would call him a modern
ballet choreographer. I love all
kinds of dance and art.

What projects are youamost
proud of?
I wrote a book on the found-
er of the Royal Ballet, Ninette
de Valois and Bar aux Folies-
Bergere, it's called The Makingof
a Choreographer. I'm very proud
of that; she's not only a remark-
able person in all the things she
did, she was a key force in the
founding of British dance culture
in the century but it was also very
important to me that she was a
woman. I also think I had a hand
in making the history of dance
more visible in the Academy here
at the University.

Detroit bankruptcy trial
resumes after settlement

United States open to talks
with Iran on Islamic State

Judge denies bond
insurer's request for
further delay
DETROIT (AP) - A judge
refused to extend a timeout
Monday in Detroit's bankruptcy
trial after a deal with a major
creditor removed another oppo-
nent from the city's plan to exit
the largest Chapter 9 case in
U.S. history.
A bond insurer, Financial
Guaranty Insurance, said it
needs more time to craft trial
strategy after another insurer
ironed out a settlement with
Detroit. But Judge Steven
Rhodes said Financial Guaranty
should have been prepared to
lose an ally, and he resumed the
trial with testimony from a pen-
sion actuary.

The trial was suspended last
Wednesday so Detroit and Syn-
cora could reach an agreement.
Syncora is getting cash and
long-term leases on a parking
garage and the tunnel between
Detroit and Canada, among
other concessions.
The settlement will help
"return the city to its citizens,"
said Detroit attorney David Hei-
man, adding that Syncora and
the city "have laid down their
swords."
Syncora and Financial Guar-
anty have been the most aggres-
sive opponents in Detroit's
bankruptcy, especially because
the city is refusing to sell art to
pay debts.
The judge is hearing evidence
to decide whether the overall
bankruptcy exit plan is fair to
creditors and feasible in the
years ahead. Thousands of retir-

ees would see a 4.5 pe
in their pension.
Separately, Syncora
from the Kirkland & E

Arts. U.S. Secretary of State John
i summer Kerry ruled out any military coor-

who is a end was not invited to Paris.
. Rhodes "That doesn't mean that we are
andalous opposed to the idea of communi-
cating to find out if they will come
y for the on board, or under what circum-
for any stances, or whether there is the
it may possibility of a change," Kerry told
ge Rosen a small group of reporters.
ora attor- France and Iraq see Shiite-
said in a powerhouse Iran as an interlocu-
tor who could bring its influence
H-,

to bear in the region against the
Sunni extremists of the Islamic
State group, but some Arab states,
like SaudiArabia, disagree.
The U.S. opposed a place for
Iran at the conference. But Teh-
ran, which has political and mili-
tary influence with its neighbor
Iraq, still managed to be part of
the conversation.
The absence of Iran under-
scored the conflicting sensitivities
and complex politics in the region
as Western countries seek to battle
the Islamic State group, which has
taken control of large parts of Iraq
and Syria.
The meeting of foreign minis-
ters from Asia, the Middle East
and the West was a first step
toward deciding who does what
min a multilayered offensive against
the Islamic State group. As envi-
sioned by France and Iraq, the
effort would include intensify-
ing airstrikes, cutting off financ-
ing, and helping Baghdad cope
through humanitarian aid and
reconstruction. There would be
no combat troops on the ground,
however.
As the conference began, two
French jets took off over Iraq in
France's first reconnaissance mis-
sions over the country in a sign of
the larger battle ahead. The Unit-
ed States has led airstrikes over
Iraq since August.
"We are asking for airborne
operations to be continued regu-
larly against terrorist sites. We
must not allow them to set up
sanctuaries. We must pursue
them wherever they are," Iraqi
President Fouad Massoum said, an
apparent reference to neighboring
Syria.
Syria, deep ina civil war waged
in part by rival extremist groups,
was the wellspring for the Islam-
ic State group, with its fighters
sweeping across the border into
Iraq, overwhelmingthe militaryin
Sunni-dominated Anbar province
and capitalizing on grievances
against the Shiite-led government
in Baghdad.
The fighters went on to conquer
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city,
with the U.S.-trained military

crumbling, and seized tanks and
other military equipment, then
steamrolled across northern Iraq.
The CIA estimates the group
has access to between 20,000 and
31,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria -
including foreigners lured to the
cause.
The recent execution of three
Western hostages - British aid
worker David Haines and two
American journalists - added
new urgency to the task of creat-
ing a viable strategy to knock out
the Islamic State group.
"We must cut off their financ-
ing. We must bring them to justice
and we must stop the fighters in
neighboring countries from join-
ing them," Massoum said at the
conference opening.
The group brings in more than
$3 million a day from oil smug-
gling, humantrafficking,theftand
extortion, according to U.S. intelli-
gence officials and private experts.
The Paris meeting was a coali-
tion of strange bedfellows, some
of whom have allegedly financed
extremist groups in Syria and
Iraq, and others, like Russia,
which backs Syria's Bashar Assad
who is also supportedbjIran.
Less than a week ago in Bagh-
dad,Kerrywas clear about the U.S.
position regarding Iran,embroiled
in a years-long dispute with the
West over concern that Tehran
wants nuclear weapons.
"The United States does not
cooperate, militarily or otherwise,
nor does it have any intention
in this process of doing so; with
Iran," he had said.
France, stressing a pragmatic
approach, felt Iran could be an
ally against a common enemy if, as
President Francois Hollande said,
Tehran "abides by principles per-
mitting a sincere and useful con-
versation."
On Monday, Kerry, inan appar-
ent about face, said he wouldn't
shut the door to talking to Iran
about a common enemy.
"We're not coordinating with
Iran, but as I said, we're open to
have a conversation at some point
in time if there's a way to find
something constructive," he said.

One man arrested
in shooting of
seven-year-old girl
Detroit police say they've
arrested a 22-year-old man and
are seeking a second suspect in the
shooting of a 7-year-old Detroit
girl who was caught in their cross-
fire while bike riding.
Police said Monday they're
seeking a second man in the Sun-
day afternoon shooting that criti-
cally injured India Williams.
India was biking in a northeast
Detroit neighborhood when the
suspects began shooting at each
other from two vehicles.
Sgt. Eren Stephens says India
was shot as one vehicle followed
another car at high speed. Kentice
Tucker tells The Detroit News her
niece was hit in the shoulder and
chest.

U.S. airstrikes aid
Iraqi fight against
ISIS militants
U.S. officials said Monday the
United States has taken the first
step in its planned expanded fight
against Islamic State militants,
going to the aid of Iraqi security
forces near Baghdad who were
being attacked by enemy fighters.
The U.S. Central Command
said it conducted two airstrikes
Sunday and Monday in support
of the Iraqi forces near Sinjar and
southwest of Baghdad.
The strikes represent the newly
broadened mission authorized by
President Barack Obama to go on
the offensive against the Islamic
State group wherever it is. Previ-
ous U.S. airstrikes in Iraq were
conducted to protect U.S. inter-
ests and personnel, assist Iraqi
refugees and secure critical infra-
structure. These strikes were
in direct support of Iraqi forces
fighting the militants.

sectarian violence erupted that
has left at least 5,000 people dead
and has forced tens of thousands
of Muslims to flee into exile in
neighboring countries.
About 1,800 additional peace-
keepers and police joined the mis-
sion as the United Nations took
over, along with some 4,800 Afri-
can troops and 1,000 international
police from the previous mission.
But the newly combined force is
only about 65 percent of what was
authorized by the U.N. Security
Council in April.

The U.N. Security Coun-
cil, human rights groups and
others called for the full and
speedy deployment of the nearly
12,000-strong force, which dip-
lomats have said won't take place
until early 2015.

Fighting around the eastern
city'sgovernment-held airporthas

REGENTS
From Page 1
October 2013 meeting, the
regents voted to name the ath-
letic campus in Ross' honor as
well.
In a communication to the,
regents, University Athletic
Director Dave Brandon and
Douglas Strong, interim execu-
tive vice president and chief
financial officer, said the facility
will serve two-thirds of the Uni-
versity's student-athletes.
TMP Architecture will begin
designing the project immedi-
ately, but a construction sched-
ule will not be completed until
schematic designs are presented
to the board.

IM Building to undergo
renovations ;
Thursday, the regents will
vote on $18.7 million worth of
improvements to the 106,000
square-foot Intramural Sports
Building. Originally constructed
in.1928, it was the first building
across higher education institu-
tions to be devoted primarily to
intramural sports.
The project will reconfigure
the existing space to create a
larger cardio workout area, new
group exercise rooms, locker
rooms, improved racquetball
courts and staff offices. The ren-
ovation will also improve acces-
sibility and include mechanical,
electrical and plumbing work;
lighting improvement and gym-
nasium floor replacement work
for the aging building.

Investment proceeds and the
Student Life Student Fee for
Facility Renewal will fund the
initiative.
In April 2013, the regents,
with support from Central
Student Government and LSA
Student Government, voted to
administer a $65 per-term stu-
dent fee to fund the renovation of
campus unions and recreational
sports facilities. The Student Life
Student Fee for Facility Renew-
al includes renovations to the
Michigan Union, Pierpont Com-
mons, the North Campus Recre-
ation Building and the Central
Campus Recreation Building.

VOTERS

sored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) proposes to enact the
Buffett Rule: no person with an
annual salary higherthan $1 mil-
lion should pay a lower effective
tax rate than those with smaller
incomes.
Though some House Repub-
licans have argued the interest
rate should rise and fall with the
economy, LSA senior Gabe Leaf,
chairman of the University's Col-
lege Republicans chapter, said
lowering interest rates would be a
helpful policy for many students.
"Student debt is a very trou-
bling thing for alot of students,"
Leaf said. "If we can get those
rates down, people will have

more disposable income and
stimulate the economy."
Leaf said he opposes Warren's
proposed revenue mechanism,
which he sees as a tax increase,
but would favor exploring ave-
nues other than taxes to pay for
loan restructuring, like a reallo-
cation of funds from other fed-
eral departments.
The importance of mobi-
lization efforts has spread to
groups on campus. Leaf said
College Republicans are joining
forcep with statewide Republi-
can efforts. They will use Face-
book to ensure young voters stay
informed on pertinent issues,
and inform them of voter regis-
tration procedures.
The College Democrats are
also prioritizing get out the vote
initiatives, LSA junior Stephen

Culbertson, College Democrats
communications director, said.
The group plans to maintain a
presence on the Diag until the
registration deadline to distrib-
ute information on registration.
Both groups anticipate host-
ing local politicians. Its members
will also go to phone banks and
do door-to-door flyering.
Aside from the two parties,
the University's Office of the
Vice President for Government
Relations is involved in educat-
ing students on how to register to
vote in time for November's elec-
tions. The deadline to register to
vote in Michigan is Oct. 6, and
the Michigan Secretary of State's
office will be on campus at the
Michigan League Monday, Sept.
22 to assist students with their
registration needs.

BOOK

makes it easy to connect and
understand in a way that some
non-fiction could be off put-
ting," Gustafson said.
Many of the narratives dis-
cussed the authors' feelings of
confusion, fear and hope dur-
ing their treatments. Some of
the drawings illustrated the
authors' feelings about losing
their hair or the author talking
to friends while going through
treatment.
One particular picture fea-
tured the author's house in one
corner of the picture and the
hospital in the opposite corner.
Between the two buildings was
a long and loopy line with no
clear direction. The picture's
caption read, "the never ending
car ride to the hospital."
The event was emotional and
intimate as many of the stu-
dents and Ann Arbor commu-
nity members in the audience
were friends and family of those
involved in the project.
After Ruben and Celeste
recounted their emotional jour-
neys, the audience was given the
opportunity to ask Paul and the
authors questions about their
experience completing the proj-
ect and have their copies of the
book signed.
Assistant Prof. Dr. Rajen
Mody supervised and mentored

Paul throughout the project..
He said many of his patients
and their families feel like his
extended family.
"The one thing about pediat-
ric cancer that people normally
do not realize is how resilient
the kids are," Mody said. "I
tell everyone that kids are my
heroes. I learn from them how
to deal with adversity."
Though Paul has volun-
teered at the Mott hospital for
the past five years, she said
the project had a profound
impact on her and allowed her
to grow her relationships with
the patients.
"It's truly been an honor
and a privilege to get to work
with these children and ado-
lescents," Paul said. "Espe-
cially by confronting a lot of
the personal and intimate
components of their experi-
ences with cancer I've been
able to really grow close to
them over the time I've spent
with them."
Paul said she hopes to contin-
ue sharing the project and would
like to hold another similar event
for the authors who were unable
to attend the reading.
"It was a very heartfelt and
open and honest experience to
be a part of," she said. "It took
a lot of bravery and courage
for the child and teen authors
to stand up there and share
their story in front of this large
audience."

Presidential
library could be in
Chicago, New York
or Honolulu
WASHINGTON (AP) - Chi-
cago, New York and Honolulu
have made the short list to host
Barack Obama's future presi-
dential library.
The Barack Obama Founda-
tion, which is developing and
raising money for the massive
legacy project, announced Mon-
day that it has selected four
universitiesto compete for the
library, culled from an initial
list of 13 applications submitted
earlier this year. The University
of Hawaii, in Obama's birthplace
Honolulu, made the cut, as did
New York's Columbia Univer-
sity. The University of Chicago,
where Obama used to teach, and
the University of Illinois at Chi-
cago round out the list.
The four institutions will
now have until December to
submit formal, in-depth propos-
als detailing their vision for the
library. The foundation's board
plans to vet those proposals
before presenting their recom-
mendations in early 2015 to the
president and first lady Michelle
Obama. The Obamas will then
make the final decision.

"Thesefourpotentialpartners
have come the farthest in meet-
ing our criteria and have each
demonstrated a strong vision for
the future Obama Presidential
Library," said Marty Nesbitt,
Obama's longtime friend and the
board's chairman.
Who didn't make the cut? A
handful of other Chicago-based
groups, including activists in
Chicago's Bronzeville neighbor-
hood, a cultural landmark for
African-Americans. Another
bid from advocates who wanted
to build the library at the for-
mer U.S. Steel South Works site
alongside Lake Michigan.
Building the library, which
will house the repository for
Obama's presidential records
and artifacts, is expected to cost
hundreds of millions of dollars
and will serve as a permanent
monument to Obama's legacy. If
other presidential libraries are a
guide, there may be an accompa-
nying presidential center, foun-
dation or policy institute that
could help Obama coordinate
his post-presidential activities.
Susan Sher, Mrs. Obama's for-
mer chief of staff and now a top
University of Chicago official,
said her institution has already
discussed the possibility for col-
laborating with two of the other
institutionsthat madetheshortlist,
although she declined to specify

whichones. Shesaid the university
would spend the next few months
gathering more input from com-
munity and culturalgroups.
"We'll be working on mak-
ing the case for what the South
Side would bring to the Obamas,
in terms of a library that would
help further their legacy and
what the library would do for
the South Side of Chicago," Sher
said in an interview.
In its 18-page request for pro-
posals, released Monday, the
foundation asked for detailed
proposals that include how the
project would be managed and
organized, what financial con-
tributions the institutions or
their partners can offer, and how
much the institution plans to pay
any consultants. The founda-
tion also wants to know about
opportunities for academic col-
laboration, diversity goals and
potential marketing strategies.
Although all of the institu-
tions chosen have already spent
months preparing their pitches,
their work has only started. The
foundation also wants in-depth
analyses of potential building
sites, including development
costs, traffic studies, tax and
zoning status, and public trans-
portation options. It's also asking
for specifics about demograph-
ics and economic trends within
a 5-mile radius of proposed sites.

Creating a new CAPS

don't like airports. Airports make me
uncomfortable. Airports make me really
uncomfortable. I worry about forgetting
my passport, or tickets,
or losing baggage, and
planes crashing, and
flying into comically bad
storms, or having a drunk
pilot (thank you for that,
Denzel Washington).
Mostly, airports make
me uncomfortable because
it's a space that makes me HAYA
hyper-aware. At any given ALFARHAN
moment, I'm worried
about looking suspicious,
making sure I'm speaking perfect English
instead of Arabic, and looking as friendly as
possible. Mostly, what makes airports uncom-
fortable for me is having to try to compose
myself in a way that puts strangers at ease.
Up until very recently, I used the same
strategy in most of my discussion-based
classes. Instead of speaking my mind, I would
censor myself, make a bland contribution, and
leave the class with a mind full of statements
I should've made instead. Until it finally
dawned on me that comfort has no place in
the classroom. When a classroom discussion is
comfortable, nothing real is being said.
Inanefforttomakestudentsfeelincludedand
safe, most professors who teach "challenging"
material often shut down discussions in
class once one student hints that s/he feels
uncomfortable. This practice is detrimental
to the learning environment. Race, gender,
religion, sexuality and politics should never
be comfortable. Students should be able to feel
safe to share their narratives and opinions in
class. Students should feel respected. Students
can even feel insulted. Students should not
feel comfortable.
Professors need to recognize that there
should be a distinction between feeling "safe"
and feeling comfortable. Often, people use
them interchangeably, and that needs to be
stopped if classrooms are aspiring to become
progressive spaces. Ifnstudents are forced out
of their comfort zone, they'll initially feel
uncomfortable, but eventually that discomfort
will trigger a need for exchange. They'll start

attempting to question their discomfort, their
opinion, and deconstruct their views, leading
to valuable discourse.
When safety and comfort are equated, it
reinforces pre-existing privilege dynamics.
When white students refuse to force
themselves to ponder the input of their fellow
students of color during discussions on race,
it's because their privilege affords them that
comfort. When male students proclaim that
their female classmates are exaggerating, it's
because they're not ready to acknowledge a
narrative that questions their privilege.
When privileged individuals are unwilling
to interrogate their internalized biases
because it makes them uncomfortable, it
forces students with marginalized identities
to trigger themselves emotionally to make a
point. Privileged comfort comes at the cost of
triggeringmarginalizedstudents.Studentswho
trigger themselves do so because these topics
consume their lives and a lack of discourse in
class is genuinely painful for them. These are
often topics that they're constantly thinking,
analyzing and being plagued by.
Yes, professors should be able to facilitate
their class discussions better, but it's
also students' responsibility to engage
wholeheartedly. They should be receptive to
narrativesthatthreatentheirviewofthe world.
They should welcome it. They should sit with
their discomfort.
It's in spaces that trigger discomfort for me
that I've learned deeper truths about myself.
It's in those spaces I've come to understand the
struggles of others and worked to understand
my role in the equation. It's in uncomfortable
exchanges and conversations that I've been
able to evolve asa person.
Discomfort is not fun, but it will make you
a less shitty person. It will make you relearn
things, teach you compassion, and yes, it
might even make you realize some pretty
painful truths. When you make the choice
to be comfortable, you're making the choice
to accept what you've been taught about
yourself and your role in the world with
no questions.

y freshman year, I was
depressed about life
and in a situation that
required imme-
diate psychologi-
cal services.
Now, don't ask
me why I wasn't
happy. I guess I,
like many stu-
dents, take off my
Supergirl "M" DEVIN
costume when EGGERT
I get home and
return not to my
alter ego, Kara Zor-El, but back to a
nerdy school girl who forgets she can
fly. Regardless, after a long delay of
procrastination due to stigma and
fear, I had finally buckled down the
courage to make an appointment
at the University's Counseling and
Psychological Services, also known
as CAPS.
The CAPS receptionist gave me
two pathway options.Iwasfaced with
a decision: Become a crisis - a psy-
chiatric emergency, with loud police
sirens and a bill high enough to match .
my instability. Or wait a month for
an appointment.
Was this a joke?
I can't deal with a go left sign if
you're Van Gogh and go rightif you're
Blair Waldorf and your date turned
you down last Saturday. I can't wait
until the end of the month. I can't
even make it through the day. But, I'm
not at the point where I need to be on
"Grey's Anatomy" or talk to Doctor
Who in the ER about why I'm feeling
like I'm dying. So instead of pickinga
side, I hid in my dorm room between
classes and cried miserably.
But, tears can fuel your drive
sometimes, ifyou can learn to turn the
switch. And that's what I did.
Being a powerhouse, I didn't
give up. I self-proclaimed my own
solution to the problem of backed-up
psychological appointments. "There
will be a CAPS on North Campus.
Not only will there be a CAPS, there
will be a CAPS, SAPAC and Trotter-
type building all in Pierpont." Come,
victimized people of the North, we
shall lead a rebellion riding our slower-
than-snails buses down the streets of
Central CampusAnnArbor!
I don't want one person on

campus to be alone like I was.
Of course, this movement didn't
come in the form of caped crusaders
or a medieval army shouting QUEEN
OF THE NORTH! Itcame in the form
of long comment cards and advocacy
meetings with grinning bureaucrats
graciously answering, "That sounds
like an excellent idea - let me do
absolutely nothing about it."
Four years later, no longer a
freshman but a budding Daily
columnist, I secured an interview
with the CAPS Director Todd Sevig,
for Student Suicide Awareness week.
I had finally leveraged myself for my
one-minute elevator pitch to change
CAPS as we know it.
I waited in the same CAPS front
room I, had been in many times
before filling out bubbled evaluation
sheets to test my sanity. I nervously
smoothed out my button-down shirt
and checked to make sure my voice
recorder worked.
Meanwhile, a dark-haired, quiet
guy, whom I had already projected
my own story on, entered the CAPS
waiting room. Knowing how the
journey of CAPS had gone for so
many of my friends and me, I listened
closer, waiting for the warm and
smiling receptionist to unintention-
ally turn away his hesitant request
for help ...

appointment, they will get an initial
consultation appointment within one

for students will still be available,
but the reality is, we've listened to
students and most prefer setting up
an appointment."
What? A department on campus
that is actually receptive to
student feedback?
"What we, as a staff, listened to
was this critique that the wait for
CAPS was too long. We overhauled
the old system in response. We had
to completely change our mindset,"
Sevig said.
Sevig talked about a promotion of
centralized efficiency, small changes
addingup to suitable big changes and
went over a newly created "draft"
flowchart with me.
Centralized efficiency? He had
found my kryptonite ... And a
flow chart?
OMG it was too much to handle.
In response to my North Campus
woes, Sevig agreed.
"CAPS has just initiated a new
embedded counseling system this
year within the school systems
on North Campus," Sevig said.
"Currently we have a staff member in
every school on North. It's too early

Identity as a Michigan student

The esquina caliente

Jf you're a kid or an unemployed twenty-
something living in Havana, to you the
corner of 23rd and G Street isthe "esquina
caliente," or the hot corner.
It's populated by skaters
using second hand boards
brought over by Canadians,
drug dealers selling tiny
bags of marijuana tied up
with floss, kids, young and
old, looking to befriend
tourists and foreign stu- ABBY
dents. The corner is a meet- TASKIER
ing spot, an important site
for creative expression,
and yet, the corner is a
microcosm of Cuba - a nation from which its
citizens can't escape.
As a foreign student at the University of
Havana, Ielected to take a class on the political
economy of socialism. My Cuban friend said
he'd teach me everythingI'd need to know about
Cuba'spoliticaleconomy- it's"nadamas,ynada
menos que tremenda mierda."Nothingmore and
nothing less than tremendous shit. Those born
after the Cuban Revolution ended in 1959 didn't
choose for their livelihoods to be dictated by
the transition towards perfect socialism, a false
concept. Or that the word transition, aword the
Cubans are governedby, is merely a justification
for forcing their contribution to an economy
that leaves only the tourists they're swindling
happy. They're trapped in an experiment they
never wished to be a part of, one drawn up in the
philosopher Karl Marx's mind.
The Cubans feast on the funds that trickle
in from foreign pockets as a result of persistent
economnic instability and social immobility.
Through the tourist and sex tourist industries,
Cuba's economy makes a significant portion
of its revenue, not including the money that's
absorbed by the Cuban sharks. The men and
women alike who prey on the naivet6 of dopey
foreigners are called sharks or "tiburones."
Living there for a significant amount of time,
I learned to mine through the clumps of salsa
dancing tiburones, though I'd been assured
that there weren'tmany diamonds inthe rough.
However, with little time, it became obvious
that being overly skeptical leads to dull results,
and within a matter of days I found my own
tibur6n, as so many foreign students do in their
efforts for cultural immersion.
Alberto, el diablo of Cuba, as he was pro-
claimed, was my Cuban boyfriend and way in to
Cuban society. "El Diablo" was written on the

top ofhis left forearmin thick, inky, black letters,
re-affirming his nickname for the general public.
He walked with a lack of urgency, and sported
the same t-shirt almost every day - black with a
picture of white skeleton bones. In exchange for
a deepened cultural experience, it was expected
that I'd pay for his food, drinks and sometimes
even household items he and his family couldn't
afford. He'd begme tolendhim money for some-
thing "urgent,"the only time urgency meant any-
thing to him, and would return the next day with
no money and abrand new material possession, in
one instance, a gold watch. In return for my coin,
I was plunged into the depths of society - taken
to underground art events that protested against
the Castros, late night discussions with counter-
revolutionaries over Cuban tobacco.
As time rolled on our feelings further devel-
oped, despite my inner reserve, into much deep-
er sense of caring. Paradoxically, the amount
we mutually exploited each other deepened
as well. We became entangled within a power.
dynamic I never could have imagined being a
part of, one that left me with constant pangs of
that American, white guilt. If I felt uncomfort-
able providing him with more money, he'd tell
me the story of his father's abandonment when
he fled to the U.S. All of his grievances were wor-
thy of complaints. He was minimally educated,
practically imprisoned on this island of despera-
tion and regardless of my nominal financial help
continued tobe stuck ina system that cared little
about his individual needs. But did that warrant
his manipulation of me? And at the end of the
semester, when he ran off with my phone and no
goodbye, were his theft and deception justifiable?
It's an incredibly difficult question to answer,
whether or not someone's situation can justify
morally corrupt actions. But what I believe to
be important in answering this is whether
or not I as a privileged American can impose
judgment on apoor and oppressed Cuban. The
imposition of judgment is dangerous, as people
from different backgrounds and opportunities
tend to impose their judgment on those who
have committed crimes, both petty and seri-
ous. Maybe it's a system that causes someone to
defy your morally acceptable chart. Or maybe
it's something else less obvious: a destructive
family situation, mental illness, etc. Regardless,
while Alberto continues to linger on the esqui-
na caliente waiting for new foreigners and their
phones, I'll try hard not to blame him.

People spend the whole summer
preparing for their first days at Mich-
igan. They've got everything fortheir
dorm, books for their classes, plenty
of nerves in their stomachs and the
words of tour guides, old friends and
University administrators running
through their minds. But quite often
there are some lessons that they've
never been told. Last year, I was the
student lugging all those unneeded
books up to my dorm. My heart filled
with the excitement of the unknown
that was college. People told me what
to bring for the dorm and what books
I would actually need to buy, but
no one ever said a word about the
mindset I would need to bring to get
through this year.
It is perfectly okay not to be
proud of this school
It's great that people are able to
love this school as much as they do,
but it is not a requirement to have
that same enthusiasm. My fresh-
man year put me firmly in the cat-
egory of students who bleed red,
not maize and blue. And I am quite
okay with that.
I go to the University of Michigan,
which is very different from being
a Michigan Wolverine. I've said it
before and I will say it again: Michi-
gan has a long way to go before I will
ever claim the identity of a Michi-
gan Wolverine without it dripping
in sarcasm.
While I'm now comfortable with
being a student at Michigan without
that enthusiastic Michigan pride, I
spent my first semester here either
making up excuse after excuse for
why I don't feel like part of the Mich-
igan community everyone speaks
so highly of, or pretending that my
love for this school runs just as deep
as "everyone else." Those first four
months of school were consumed by
telling myself these feelings of isola-
tion were not due to the multitude of

issues that plague this institution;
no, it was my fault, I wasn't doing
college "right."
It took me too long to realize that
it wasn't me doing college "wrong"
that made me stand on the outside
as everyone else cheered themselves
hoarse with each "It's great to be a
Michigan Wolverine." My experi-
ences led me to this conclusion, and
that conclusion is perfectly fine. Your
experiences will bring you to your
own conclusions. Maybe you will
bleed maize and blue, maybe not. The
only thing you need to do is honor
whatever conclusion you come to.
Question your professors
I remember coming into orien-
tation with people having told me
that Professor X was just brilliant,
and to listen to and absorb every
word that came out of his mouth.
Don't get me wrong, Michigan
has talented professors, but none
of them are gods. Professors say
some messed up things and need to
be held accountable for it. So even
though your friend said to bask in
the glory of this professor's bril-
liance, take your time and actu-
ally listen to what is being said. You
aren't at this school to regurgitate
what your professors say; you're
here to learn how to think critically
and draw your own conclusions. So
start with your professors. Why did
they choose to start the semester
rattling off their many degrees or
showing you a clip of themselves
on MSNBC? Just as they ask you for
an explanation of your opinions, be
critical of what they say, how they
say it, who is saying it, etc.
Forget a significant amount of
what you learned on tours and at
orientation
Once second semester came
around and navigating my way
around tour groups started to
become part of my daily routine, I

couldn't help but roll my eyes and
recall how the University I was told
about at orientation and on tours
is vastly different from the one I
experiended. Just remember the
intention behind orientation and
campus tours; they are meant to get
you onto campus and then keep you
here for the next four years.
Respect the changes that come
from this year
I am far from the same person
I was last September. And I have
lost many friends because of it.
These changes aren't to be feared.
Embrace them. Critique them. In
the same sense that your experi-
ences will bring about changes in
yourself, don't expect your friends
to return home the same.
Allow yourself to. ignore
what you "should" be doing and
instead do what you want.
Some of the best memories I have
are from days when I put college
as a distant second to the people
who have supported me. Forget
the paper due in two days and go
to a friend's event; stay up until 6
a.m. talking, dancing, eating; then
repeat this the next day with late
night runs to sweet shops and phil-
osophical discussions lasting until
4 a.m. We all need these moments
to just be and enjoy the people we
have found. College is stressful.
The deadlines, expectations and
stupidity of people will get to you,
so these moments when you com-
pletely ignore your "responsibili-
ties" will not only serve you well,
but will also fulfill your responsi-
bility to yourself as an individual.

is similar to Coldplay's Mylo
Xyloto in that they both mix
synthesizers and industrial
electronics in hopes of famil-
iarizing their classic sound to
the 21st century. By attempting
to make their music more relat-
able to the kids these days, both
bands lost the intrinsic ele-
ments of what once made their
sound cool. The addition of con-
temporary artist Lykke Li to the
album's final song, "Troubles,"
wasn't a bad decision, but per-
haps the influence of youthful
producers like Danger Mouse
and One Republic's Ryan Ted-
der molded the music too much
to please another generation of
music listeners. However emo-
tional and personal the album
may be, it feels over-processed
and forced on too many occa-
sions.
The unforeseen success of
Beyonce's most recent album
was impressive and inspir-
ing, but unsurprising when
considering the passion of her
fan base. U2's surprise release
succeeds in accomplishing its
purpose: to act as a sonic time
capsule for the band's past and
the influences and anecdotes
they garnered along the way.
U2 and even Bono person-
ally have experienced decades
worth of stardom, yet the age
group they tried to access in
their album's release has less
passionate connections to U2.
Adamant followers of U2 are
generally more likely to buy a
material CD of this album and
less likely to attempt to update
their iTunes account. An
instantly downloaded album is
an exciting prospect for future
popular artists, but is realized
here as another mistake col-
lected in attempting to amass
appreciation from the uninter-
ested millennials running the
Internet.

There are only a couple of live
albumsthat, in full, ISwould put
in that special pantheonof Music
That Has Truly Affected Me. One
is by Van Morrison, one of the
most legend-
ary singer-
songwriters of
all time. The
other is by a "
one-hit-won- Y
der ska-punk
band.
Let's start AM
with that THEISEN
second one.
Ihappened

AlbumaIs Better than Your Live
Album by Reel Big Fish when I
was in middle school, an age at
which it seems any boy who dis-
covers skamusic will inexplicably
fall in love with it. Unless you also
had askaphase, though, you've
probably only encountered Reel
Big Fish if you've seen the movie
"BASEketball" or have heard the
Michiganopep band play "Sell
Out" (the group's only charting
single, released in 1997).
I don't necessarily recommend
that you go listento allitwo hours
of OurLiveAlbum ... right now, but
I will say that I played the crap
out of that CD set. I'll still go back
to it nowadays every once in a
while when I'm feeling nostalgic.
It's filled with juvenile, annoying
jokes, but there's still some fun to
be had, with'80s songs like "Boys
Don't Cry" and "Take on Me"
covered and the genre experi-
mentations that accompany that
10-minute version of "S.R."
The banter and the playful-
ness of the album helped me feel
like I was building a relationship
with the band as I was listening.
Live albums, when they're not
just greatest hits collectionsewith
cheering placed in between the
tracks or cashgrabs from bands
who don't really have much to
offer in concert, canmake you feel
like you're experiencingan artist
for real. Even if Inever actually
saw Reel Big Fish in person, Ikind
of felt like I had met them and got-
ten to know them, just from how
accessible, inviting and well-put-
together its live record was.
But what about Van? I'll never
feel likeI can truly know Van
Morrison. His music is amazing
because it always soundselike he's
on a higher spiritual plane than
all of us. Its Too Late to Stop Now,
a live record released in1974, still
stands up todayas one of the most
beautiful, fun and astounding
albums ever recorded. Anyone

Animation fuels modern cinema of attractions

By CONRAD FOREMAN
Daily Arts Writer
When I talk to people about
films (a go-to topic when I feel the
social awkwardness closing in on
me), I find a majority of people tend
to focus on the plot - whether the
characters' actions were believ-
able, the ending fulfilling enough
or the climax sufficiently exciting.
Being a film nerd, I often focus on
visual elements that seem to go
unnoticed and/or unappreciated
by many of my fellow viewers (or
maybe just appreciated in different
ways).
Don't get me wrong - I believe
that film (and serial TV) is the
most powerful platform for telling
stories that we've ever seen (sorry,
books). But film is so much more
than just a story-telling medium.
This idea hearkens me back to my
SAC teachings at the University,
specifically regarding the cinema
of attractions. For those who don't
know (and probably don't care), the
term 'cinema of attractions' refers
to films that appeal to viewers not
for their stories, but for their trick
photography, unique camera work
and the ability to show viewers
things they have never seen before.
Most often the cinema of attrac-
tions refers to a period of early film
history around the turn of the cen-
tury (remember the old filmmaker
from "Hugo?" - he was a real guy
named George M6lies who spe-

cialized in cinema of attractions),
during which the cinema of attrac-
tions had its glory days. Narrative
cinema coexisted with its more
avant-garde counterpart, but as
films in general became more
commonplace, trick photography
wowed audiences less and less, and
the psyche of the audience shifted:
the story became more important
that ever before.
There are a number of reasons
that narrative cinema won out
over the cinema of attractions.
Some are obvious, others more
obscure (studios perhaps wanted
productions that were easier to
mass-produce). Regardless, the
apparent truth is that classical
Hollywood narrative films are
far more popular than films that
appeal to us visually. But are they?
The top grossing film of all time is
"Avatar," and the new "Transform-
ers" film (which I haven't seen, but
by all accounts is a junkyard come
to life) has already earned over a
billion dollars. I can't speak to the
storyline of "Transformers," but I
will say, as many have, that the plot
of "Avatar" is nothing special; we'd
already been told the same story in
"Dances With Wolves," "Pocahon-
tas" and others.
So why was "Avatar" still so suc-
cessful despite telling an unorigi-
nal story? Because it is classic
cinema of attractions. The stun-
ning animation and innovative
3D experience made "Avatar" a

nsurprisingly, Pixar leads (not to mention the first ten min-
. utes would make the saddest short
film of all time). Still, the success
of the film seems to hinge on the
n quirky things that can only be done
through animation (dogs speaking
aand flying planes, a floating house,
a boy who defies racial classifica-
tion); were this simply the story of

a young, boisterous boy, the film's
magic (at least in the visual sense)
would be gone.
In 2010 perhaps the best ani-
mated argument for the continued
success of the cinema of attraction
hit theaters - "How to Train Your
Dragon." The story of the film is
nice enough, but the supporting
characters aren't as funny as they'd
like to be; the real magic of the film
is every scene in which Hiccup
flies with his dragon, Toothless.
I found myself somewhat unin-
terested in the plot, yet the flying
sequences never cease to take my
breath away. The follow-up to this
film mirrors its predecessor in this
wav and the nlmination of the

trilogy in a few years willbe remiss
if it doesn't show some major love
to the flight sequences.
I've listed only a few examples
and I'm not really sure if there's
an argument here, or even a coher-
ent train of thought. I suppose I'm
mostly trying to say that I love ani-
mation and offer a semi-academic
justification for why I see more
children's films than adult films in
theaters. The cinema of attractions
can survive nowhere if not the big
screen. Take your "Transformers,"
I'd rather punt all pretense of real-
ity and be swallowed by the sepa-
rate universe of animation.
By the way, watch "Kung Fu

"The Little Mermaid" took us

two-dimensionality of the ani-

Story," released only three years
after "Aladdin." Computer anima-
tion offers opportunity to create
entire universes separate from our
own, where gravity works back-
wards, animals speak English and
everybody walks around doing
handstands. The leap forward
in animation technology even

'Smells like teen spirit'
fAF 's'Funeral' turns 1

By BRIAN BURLAGE
Daily Arts Writer
When I was a sophomore in
high school, Iused to think that in
order to truly connect with a song,
the volume on the radio had to be
turned up to its maximum level
(or somewhere close to it). Songs
would blare through my speak-
ers and fill the car with the very
substance of their noise. Physics
classes had taught me that songs
and sounds travel in wavelengths
and that wavelengths impose a
kind of physicality on the sur-
faces they strike. To connect with
a song meant to feel it approach
your ears, to imagine its invisible
rockets of sound ricochet off the
walls or to let the wiry limbs of its
instruments tangle and untangle
around you like wind-blown bal-
loon strings.
Along with most other things
in high school, that belief turned
out to be more of a passing phase
than a soulful commitment. I rev-
eled in the senselessness of my
personal ethos. When school-
work, family or relationships
clouded my mind, I would chase
them out with sound. The bands
blasting through the radio could
do all the negotiating for me. I
believed that volume, above all,
could douse a song with gasoline
and gss a match shamelessly in
its direction - that in the warm
hum of that sonic blaze, music
found its heaviest and most
potent frequency.

RECRUITING
Future Wolverines
have quiet weekend

'M' preps for up-tempo Utes

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
DailySports Writer
The 2015 Michigan football
recruiting class is ranked 20th in
the nation by ESPN. Wolverine
commitshadaneventfulweekend
that included a suspension, a
masterful passing performance
and more. Here's a rundown:
Chris Clark, tight end: Avon
Old Farms (Conn.) Ranking:
ESPN (109) Scout (26)
Avon Old Farms has yet to
start its football season.
Brian Cole, athlete: Saginaw
Heritage (Mich.) at Midland
Dow (Mich.) Ranking: ESPN
(139) Scout (40)
Cole had a forgetful weekend
in Heritage's 56-6 loss on Friday.
Cole didn't see the field in the
first quarter due to disciplinary
reasons and received an
unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty in the second quarter
which led to his ejection and a
one-game suspension.
Michael Weber, running
back: Cass Tech (Mich.) vs.
Detroit Southeastern (Mich.)
Ranking: ESPN (169) Scout (104)
For the second straight week,
Weber's stats were limited
because Cass Tech got out to an
early lead against a much weaker
opponent. Cass Tech won 48-0.
Tyree Kinnel, safety: Wayne
(Ohio) vs. Lakota West (Ohio)
Ranking: ESPN (192) Scout (152)
Kinnel played offense for the
first time this season, scoring
two touchdowns on three
carries and playing lockdown
defense in Wayne's 34-29 win.
Grant Newsome, offensive

tackle: The Lawrenceville
School (N.J.) Ranking: ESPN
(242) Scout (215)
Lawrenceville didn't play
this week and the first regular
season game is on Friday.
Darrin Kirkland Jr.,
linebacker: Lawrence Central
(Ind.) at Warren Central (Ind.)
Ranking: ESPN (266) Scout (114)
Kirkland had his first quiet
outing in Lawrence Central's
41-22 loss. Warren Central
racked up 334 yards rushing
against Kirkland's defense.
Alex Malzone, quarterback:
Brother Rice (Mich.) vs.
Pickerington North (Ohio)
Ranking: ESPN (NR) Scout (184)
Malzone continued his strong
senior campaign by throwing
four touchdowns, upping his
total to 10on the season in three
games.
Jon Runyan Jr., offensive
lineman: St. Joseph's Prep (Pa.)
at St. Ignatius (Ohio) Ranking:
(NR)
Runyan played well, but his
team couldn't grind out a win
against the nation's fourth-best
team, losing 42-34.
Andrew David, kicker:
Washington (Ohio) vs. Warren
Harding (Ohio) Ranking: (NR)
David was 2-for-2 on field goal
attempts from 21 and 38 yards,
respectively, and helped lead his
team to a 46-24 win.
Garrett Taylor, cornerback:
St. Christopher's (Va.) Ranking:
ESPN (111) Scout (268)
Taylor is out for his senior
season after tearing his anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee
during offseason practice.

By ALEJANDRO ZOIrnGA
Managing Sports Editor
Having faced the new-look
offense run by coordinator Doug
Nussmeier in practices and
scrimmages,
the Michigan NOTEBOOK
football team's
defense feels prepared for an
up-tempo attack.
But the Wolverines' version of
up-tempo might not compare to
what they'll encounter Saturday
whentheyhost Utah.
The Utes have averaged nearly
a point per minute through their
first two games and boast the
third-best scoring offense in
the country. They get to the line
quickly, making it difficult to
complete defensive substitutions,
and they spread the field with
three- and four-receiver sets.
As Michigan defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison
said Monday, Utah's offense
resembles that of Indiana. And
last year, the Hoosiers burned
his unit for 47 points and 572
total yards.
"You're going to have to really
be on your game to make sure
you're disciplined, that you get
lined up, that you're not lazy in
gettingset, and all those kinds of
things," Mattison said.
Mattison mentioned a drill
in which Michigan's offense
operated with "a whole wave
of guys," running plays against
the defense. But containing
that tempo for an entire game
- particularly if the Wolverines
have a negative turnover margin
again - could prove difficult.
"I don't know if it's a
measuring stick, but it's a big
game," Mattison said.
Michigan does have
significant depth defensively,
enough so that coach Brady
Hoke said injuries didn't affect
the unit last Saturday against
Miami (Ohio). And that could

Michigan will have its hands full with Utah, which is averaging 57.5 points per game and has had extra time to prepare.

prove crucial if fatigue becomes
a factor late in the game.
Where Michigan might
disrupt Utah most is with its
defensive line and linebackers.
The Wolverines have allowed
fewer than 100 rushing yards in
their last two games combined.
And given the Utes thrived
on a balanced attack against
Fresno State in their last game
- accumulating 268 passing
yards and 258 on the ground
- a combination of stifling the
run and pressuring quarterback
Travis Wilson could cripple
Utah's attack.
"We've got so much that we
want to accomplish on defense,
and this is the next game," he
said. "It happens to be against an
offense that, ranking-wise, is one
of the top in the country.
"That's what makes it a special
game and a big game for our
defense."
MR. POPULAR: Sophomore
quarterback Shane Morris has

yet to throw a touchdown in
his collegiate career, but some
people still wish he'd earn the
starting job over Devin Gardner.
The fifth-year senior's four
turnovers against Notre Dame
and subsequent inaccuracy
against the RedHawks certainly
haven't helped matters. And
Nussmeier isn't surprised some
fans hopped on the Morris
bandwagon.
"The backup quarterback is
always the most popular guy in
town," Nussmeier said. "Shane
has done a tremendous job....
(He) continues to really get"
better and better. I believe Devin
is, too."
Ingarbage time againstMiami,
Morris went 0-for-2 but moved
the offense into RedHawks
territory with a 27-yard run. And
his incompletions weren't ugly,
either. On both pass attempts,
the sophomore rolled left and
threw catchable balls. The first
was dropped, and the second

fell to the turf when redshirt
sophomore receiver Jehu
Chesson couldn't secure it.
Meanwhile, Nussmeier noted
that Gardner's interception
against Miami was tipped at the
line of scrimmage, and the coach
blamed himself for some of the
struggles.
"I think it's unfair to say
that this guy or that guy is the
problem," Nussmeier said.
INJURY NON-UPDATE:
Hoke gave no update when
explicitly asked about statuses
of Desmond Morgan, Devin
Funchess and Khalid Hill.
"We're not going to talk about
any of those guys who didn't
play," Hoke said.
Why not?
"Because I don't feel like it,"
the coach explained.
Funchess walked through
campus without a noticeable
limp and wasn't wearing a boot
as of late Monday afternoon, per.
the Daily's Max Cohen.

Q&A: Zack Novak

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Former Michigan men's
basketball player Zack Novak
was in Ann Arbor last week, but it
wasn't for basketball.
Novak played for Michigan
from 2008-2012 playing in 134
career games and starting in
122 games - both tied for third
all-time in program history. His
4,537 minutes rank first all-time
in program history.
On campus to participate in
Entrepalooza, an event put on by
the Business School promoting
entrepreneurship, Novak's focus
has shifted off the hardwood to
the board room.
The Michigan Daily: It looks
like you've traded in the jersey
for business attire. What have
you been doing since getting back
from playing overseas?
Zack Novak: It's been really
exciting.Youspendtimeincollege
building these skills and everyone
says they're going to translate
into business, they're going to
translate into the next phase of
life. And when it's actually time
to go execute that, it's exciting.
I think for now for me, it's just
getting that base of experience.
Because when you're playing you
don't even have the time to do
the internships and everything
that the typical student has time
to do. So now it's so interesting,
the things that I'm doing, the
company that I'm working with,
it's just really fun.
TMD: What was life like
playing in Europe?
ZN: I think it was a great
life experience. Going from
Michigan, where everything is
taken care of for you and it's just
top notch, to going overseas, I
think it was a great transition for
me going into business. Because
you had to grow up alittle bit, and
I think I went through that. I had
a little growing pain when I first
got there, but it was awesome. It
was an experience I would never
trade in for anything.
