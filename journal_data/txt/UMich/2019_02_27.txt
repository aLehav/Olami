Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
gathered in Forsythe Middle 
School’s cafeteria to discuss 
plans for a tunnel connection 
between Bandemer Park and 
Huron River Drive, as well as 
the non-motorized Border-to-
Border Trail, Tuesday night. 
The meeting was held by 
Peter Sanderson, senior park 
planner for the Washtenaw 
County Parks and Recreation 
Commission, 
and 
Hillary 
Hanzel, park planner and 
landscape architect for the 
city of Ann Arbor.
The purpose of the meeting 
was 
to 
raise 
community 
awareness and collect general 
feedback and input at early 

stages of project development. 
The meeting began with a 
PowerPoint 
presentation 
detailing the plans of the 
tunnel and the Border-to-
Border Trail.
Sanderson 
shared 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
trail, 
emphasizing the importance 
of community connection.
“The real goal is connecting 
our communities, connecting 
people to parks and places 
together,” 
Sanderson 
said. 
We’re really connecting some 
of our large facilities together 
— we have almost 50 parks in 
the region. The goal of our 
project is to create a safe and 
legal connection.”

On Tuesday night, more than 
50 undergraduate and graduate 
students gathered in the Ross 
School 
of 
Business’s 
Blau 
Colloquium for an event titled 
“Poverty Simulation: Making 
Sense of Making it in America,” 
gaining a perspective on the 
daily decisions and dilemmas 
of people facing poverty in the 
U.S.
During 
the 
three-
hour 
simulation, 
student 
participants were organized 
into 
families, 
assigned 
demographic roles and were 
subsequently faced with a series 

of 
socioeconomic 
obstacles, 
ranging 
from 
mortgage 
payments to childcare and 
daily transportation costs.
The 
simulation 
was 
organized and facilitated by 
Poverty Solutions, a research 
center at the University of 
Michigan launched in 2016, 
which aims to illuminate the 
causes 
and 
consequences 
of 
American 
poverty 
in 
search of viable solutions to 
socioeconomic concerns felt by 
millions across the country.
Trevor Bechtel, the student 
engagement coordinator for 
Poverty Solutions, elaborated 
on 
the 
mission 
of 
the 
University’s center, which is 

based in the Ford School of 
Public Policy.
“Our goal is to find projects 
where we can understand what 
makes a material difference in 
people’s lives,” Bechtel said. 
“We have a partnership with 
the city of Detroit. It’s the 
only partnership that exists 
between 
a 
major 
research 
university 
and 
a 
mayor’s 
office.”
According 
to 
Bechtel, 
 
Poverty Solutions put a great 
deal of work into creating a 
realistic experience for student 
participants.
“We partnered with the 
Interfaith Council for Peace 
and Justice to do the event,” 

Bechtel said. “They’ve been 
doing these for about 25 years. 
They’re a group down in 
Missouri, but this simulation 
is customized to Washtenaw 
County. They collect volunteers 
from 
a 
whole 
variety 
of 
demographic groups.”
Chuck 
Warpehoski, 
the 
current director of the ICPJ 
and 
a 
former 
Ann 
Arbor 
city 
councilman, 
explained 
ensuring the reality of the 
situations posed to participants 
was a key factor in crafting 
the 
simulation. 
Warpehoski 
said many of the simulation’s 
volunteers provided a real-life 
perspective to participants.

Since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the academic year, several 
LSA 
classes 
have 
been 
participating 
in 
a 
pilot 
program of iClicker Reef, a 
new student response system 
from 
Macmillan 
Learning, 
to ask a wider variety of 
questions 
than 
traditional 
iClicker remotes. This pilot 
program is being used to help 
the LSA Instructional Support 
Services weigh in on what 
advantages the system brings, 
as well as any problems that 
may arise. 
Students in the pilot classes 
can access Reef through an 
app to answer an instructor’s 
prompted 
questions. 
In 
addition to handling multiple 
choice questions, Reef allows 
students 
to 
write 
short 
responses and use a target 
picture to drop points on a 
chart — something the iClicker 
remotes cannot do. The app 
also confirms if the instructor 
has received the response and 
records the response feedback 
for later access.

Often hailed as Michigan’s 
Silicon Valley, Ann Arbor is home 
to a variety of entrepreneurs 
and up-and-coming tech firms. 
Recently published research now 
indicates the city is a major hub for 
women-led startups.
A study published by the Center 
for American Entrepreneurship 
found Ann Arbor was one of the 
top cities in the U.S. for female-
founded startups. The study is 
based on the number of these 
startups — with a criteria of at 
least one female founder — raising 
initial venture investments over 
the past 20 years.
In recent years, there has been 
an increase in women-founded 
venture-backed startups in the 
U.S, according to the study. It 
looked at the number of startups 
in the U.S. that raised their first 
round of venture capital financing 
between 2005 and 2017. From 
this information, the researchers 
concluded the share of women-led 
startups that were able to raise a 
first round has improved from 7 
percent to 21 percent of the total 
share.

The University of Michigan 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance hosted an event on 
Tuesday to raise awareness 
about sexual and gender-based 
misconduct in the performing 
arts, and to explore potential 

solutions to the problem. The 
event brought in a crowd of 
approximately 90 community 
members and featured a panel, 
audience Q&A session and a 
variety of musical performances.
This event comes in light of 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
this year against Music, Theatre 

& 
Dance 
School 
professors 
Stephen 
Shipps 
and 
David 
Daniels.
Panelist Kaaren Williamsen, 
director of the U-M Sexual

event by discussing how sexual 
misconduct is both a personal 

and community matter. She 
said 
she 
understands 
how 
challenging it can be to address 
these issues, but she advocated 
for creating a culture resistant 
to 
sexual 
assault 
through 
prevention and intervention.

On Tuesday, The Michigan 
Center 
on 
Lifestage 
Environmental 
Exposures 
and 
Disease 
sponsored 
its 
annual “Climate Change and 
Health: 
What 
the 
Science 
Says and What We Can Do” 
forum in collaboration with 

the 
Environmental 
Health 
Sciences department of the 
School of Public Health and the 
School for Environment and 
Sustainability of the University 
of Michigan. 
Trish 
Koman, 
University 
researcher 
in 
the 
Public 
Health School and School of 
Engineering, moderated the 
event. 
She 
had 
previously 

worked on the event and 
helped choose this year’s topic 
of climate change and health.
“We wanted to talk about 
climate change and health 
because there is a really strong 
connection 
between 
what 
happens in the environment 
and public health,” Koman 
said. “And we wanted to have 
people understand the science 
and understand what they 
can do.”
The first speaker was F. 
Dubois Bowman, dean of 
the Public Health School. 
Bowman 
emphasized 
the 
University’s 
historical 
dedication to climate change 
and environmental issues, 
referencing 
a 
student-
organized 
environmental 
teach-in on the University’s 
campus 
in 
1970. 
He 
introduced the theme of 
an integrated approach to 
solving climate change.
“Our University’s history 
tells us that the issue of 
climate 
and 
health 
has 
been at the forefront of 
our concern for over a half 
century,” 
Bowman 
said. 
“The challenges and barriers 
to effective management of 
climate change and public 
health are no longer purely 
environmental — in fact, 
no longer purely scientific. 
They’re 
ethical, 
social, 
political and economic.”
John 
M. 
Balbus, 
senior adviser for public 
health 
at 
the 
National 

Institute 
of 
Environmental 
Health 
Sciences, 
echoed 
Bowman’s views on taking a 
multidisciplinary approach to 
climate change. He explained 
that the University, with a 
large variety of programs and 
resources, has the capacity to 
create integrated solutions.
“We have to think about 
solutions that are not just 
focused on climate change, 
but 
are 
focused 
on 
real 
communities and real people 
and think in an integrated 
fashion,” Balbus said. “The 
challenges that we face, and 
especially the solutions that 
need to be implemented, are 
solutions that cut across every 
single program of this school, 
whether it’s the engineering 
side, legal side, social science 
side and even the cultural 
side.”
Kim 
Knowlton, 
senior 
scientist and deputy director at 
the Natural Resources Defense 
Council focused on four key 
diverse areas, each related 
to climate change: science, 
education, law and people. 
She explained the health risks 
associated with extreme heat, 
and the impacts that legal 
action can have.
“Detroit could see by the 
2080’s a 120 percent increase 
(in heat-related mortality),” 
Knowlton said. “That’s more 
than doubling, in heat-related 
mortality, but if we go to 
a 
lower-emissions 
carbon 
pollution scenario, if we put 

94TH HE NRY RUSSE L LECTURE

ON THE DAILY: A2 AMONG MOST RESPONSIVE IN USE OF SEECLICKFIX

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: BLACK STUDENTS ENTER 
CLASSES, READ DEMANDS

Ann Arbor was named 
one of the top 10 most 
engaged 
and 
responsive 
local 
governments 
nationally, based on the use 
of a local app. The A2 Fix 
It app allows Ann Arbor 
residents to report public 
property concerns directly 
to 
the 
city 
to 
address. 
Ann Arbor ranked eighth 
in most responsive local 
government 
nationwide, 
according to parent app 
SeeClickFix’s data.
SeeClickFix 
allows 
residents to submit requests 

to local governments in 342 
municipalities. 
Residents 
report 
concerns 
such 
as 
potholes, 
abandoned 
bicycles, downed trees and 
sidewalk maintenance. The 
company also ranked Ann 
Arbor ninth in the number 
of 
requests 
sent 
in 
by 
residents, citing an average 
of 1,800 requests per month.
In 2018, the city of Ann 
Arbor 
closed 
out 
more 
than 12,000 of the 14,000 
requests. SeeClickFix told 
MLive the data illustrates 
Ann Arbor’s devotion to 
their community and trust 
in their government. The 
City 
Council 
approved 

a 
three-year 
contract 
to 
continue 
with 
the 
SeeClickFix service at a 
total cost of $40,000.
City 
Administrator 
Howard 
Lazarus 
told 
MLive 
some 
requests 
attempt to address issues 
out of the scope of the city’s 
jurisdiction such as animal 
removal, or express opinions 
about the city. In addition, 
residents 
may 
request 
unnecessary services such 
as pruning trees. Because 
not all messages submitted 
through the system pertain 
to specific city requests, the 
SeeClickFix data might be 
skewed.

“This interferes with the 
integrity of the data that is 
reported out of the system 
in that it doesn’t reflect 
efficiency of city operations 
so 
much 
as 
it 
reflects 
the desire of residents to 
have 
city-owned 
trees 
aggressively 
pruned,” 
Lazarus told MLive.
The city has convened 
a 
committee 
to 
draft 
recommendations 
for 
improving 
the 
app’s 
functionality 
for 
the 
city. It hopes to address 
improvements 
in 
data 
reporting 
and 
train 
employees to better use the 
system.

Feb. 26, 1970
Disruptions occurred in 
several classes yesterday 
when 
black 
students 
attempted to read a list 
of demands for increased 
minority admissions. 
A 
few 
brief 
scuffles 
broke out and classes were 
cancelled in at least four 
cases when the instructors 

refused to let the blacks 
speak. Other classes were 
more peaceful when the 
students were allowed to 
present 
their 
demands. 
Most left after about ten 
minutes. 
It 
was 
unclear 
last 
night what group, if any, 
organized the actions of 
the black students. Walter 

Lewis, of the Black Students 
Union, 
said 
last 
night 
that the actions were not 
connected with a teach-
in sponsored in the Union 
yesterday 
by 
the 
Black 
Action Movement (BAM). 
The demands the black 
students read to the classes 
are part of BAM’s drive 
for 
increased 
minority 

admissions 
- 
the 
same 
demands they presented to 
the Regents last week. 
Tied to the goal of black 
enrollment in 1973 equal to 
10 percent of the University’s 
total enrollment, is a call for 
increased counseling and 
supportive services to help 
minority students adjust to 
the University.

For The Daily

limits on our carbon pollution, 
we could cut that in half.”
Knowlton felt the current 
climate 
and 
health 
issues 
present an opportunity for 
reform.
“We might think of all this as 
opportunity … to move toward 
a smarter, more strategic, more 
equitable, 
healthier, 
more 
sustainable future,” Knowlton 
said. “It is our demand to move 
toward that future that is really 
going to push this boat forward. 
It’s not going to happen as we 
sit back.”
Knowlton also highlighted 
the 
University’s 
efforts 
to 
decrease carbon dioxide, use 
more wind and solar energy and 
incentivize energy efficiency.
Questions varied during the 
panel session, ranging from the 
topic of floods to the limiting 
the carbon footprint of medical 
institutions. 
LSA 
freshman 
Ariana Mitcham asked the 

panel about helping countries 
with fewer resources approach 
climate issues while managing 
environmental issues within 
the country.
“The U.S. thinks very, very 
differently about development 
and 
about 
development 
assistance than the rest of 
the world,” Balbus said. “As 
historically one of the larger 
polluters of the atmosphere, 
(Americans) need to address 
our own actions. The rest of 
the world frames this kind 
of a question these days, to a 
large degree, in terms of the 
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals, 
from 
a 
policy 
perspective. I think one of the 
important ways to address a 
complicated interrelated set 
of 
challenges 
in 
countries 
like Myanmar is through an 
institutional framework.”

“I always think about this 
sexual misconduct, sexual 
assault, sexual harassment 
as an issue that impacts 
people 
individually, 
right?” Williamsen said. 
“These 
are 
things 
that 
impact people personally 
in a traumatic way … but 
it’s 
also 
a 
community 
issue, 
and 
we 
know 
that. 
Communities 
are 
impacted when something 
happens. 
Communities 
are also places where we 
support things happening 
and 
traditions, 
where 
sometimes 
we 
don’t 
intervene when we see 
something 
happening 
because we think it’s not 
our problem, or we just 
look away because ‘that 
can’t be right.’”
Panelist Amy O’Neal, an 
activist and choreographer 
of 
Opposing 
Forces, 
a 
dance troupe expressing 
ideas 
around 
femininity 
and 
masculinity, 
shared 
a 
personal 
story 
of 
experiencing misconduct. 
She 
said 
at 
the 
after 
party of her solo dance 
performance, 
an 
arts 
newspaper critic paid an 
attendee $20 to pull her 
pants down. O’Neal said 
she felt vulnerable and 
exposed, noting the power 
dynamics involved.
“I 
think 
there’s 
this 
power 
dynamic 
that 

sometimes 
happens 
with 
performers 
and 
audience 
members 
and 
administrators 
that 
they think they know us 
because of the things that 
we show,” O’Neal said. 
“And in the place where I 
was supposed to feel safe, 
I don’t feel safe anymore.”
Panelist Eun Lee, founder 
of The Dream Unfinished, 
an 
activist 
orchestra, 
discussed her experience 
being 
inappropriately 
touched in a work setting. 
She said she was talking 
to donors at a fundraiser 
for 
the 
nonprofit 
she 
worked 
for 
when 
an 
unknown man touched her 
without consent. Lee said 
instead of finding the man 
immediately, she continued 
her discussion with the 
important donors. When 
she told her coworkers, 
they were supportive but 
also prioritized the event. 
No one told their boss until 
the next morning after the 
fundraising 
goals 
were 
met.
Lee said she often feels 
the goals of organizations 
are more important than 
people, and she discussed 
how this is something that 
needs to change. 
“I 
myself 
wondered 
whether it was worth it 
to bring attention to what 
happened,” 
Lee 
said. 
“But what kind of culture 
are 
we 
creating 
where 
organizational 
interests 

are prioritized above the 
safety of people?”
Another 
audience 
member said he does not 
think there is a way to 
eradicate sexual predators 
or end this type of behavior. 
He said it is inherently part 
of human nature. 
“It seems to me that 
sexual 
predation 
has 
existed for thousands of 
years,” he said. “It seems 
like 
sexual 
predation 
has become embedded in 
human 
nature. 
We 
can 
enforce 
zero 
tolerance, 
but are we able to actually 
prevent it?”
Panelist 
Laura 
Fisher, 
co-founder 
of 
#NotInOurHouse, 
an 
organization for victims of 
sexual harassment in the 
theater industry, disagreed 
with the audience member 
and said all people have 
a choice in how they act. 
She said claiming sexual 
predation is human nature 
is not an excuse. 
“I do not think sexual 
predation is something to 
accept in the workplace, 
in any workplace,” Fisher 
said. “We know more than 
we used to, not only about 
how 
the 
body 
operates 
and how there are not two 
genders, how we actually 
can control ourselves if we 
would like to. I think as 
humans, what we have is 
both choice and control.”
Andrew 
Fyles, 
a 
Music, Theatre & Dance 

sophomore, told The Daily 
after the event that he 
really 
appreciated 
the 
open discussion the panel 
fostered. He said there 
is a lack of opportunities 
to talk about the recent 
accusations, 
and 
he 
thinks students can learn 
from 
hearing 
others’ 
personal experiences with 
sexual misconduct in the 
workplace.
“I just think it was cool 
that there was a way for 
people to have discussion 
about 
this 
because 
it 
seems to be a very big 
topic of discussion lately, 
and there doesn’t seem to 
be any actual discussion 
about it from peer to 
peer,” Fyles said. “I think 
it’s nice that Michigan 
has these resources and 
these events for people to 
have these conversations 
and for people to share 
their stories about how 
they 
experienced 
these 
issues.”
Fyles also said he wished 
the 
panelists 
discussed 
more solutions, as he is 
unsure of what action to 
take moving forward.
“I think it was a little 
bit unclear as to exactly 
what the solutions are, 
honestly,” Fyles said. “But I 
think it was still helpful to 
be able to have a discussion 
about it even though I’m 
not sure what exactly to 
take away from it or what 
to do next.”

The 
Border-to-Border 
Trail is part of a larger 
project, 
the 
Iron 
Belle 
Trail. The Iron Belle Trail 
spans 
over 
2,000 
miles 
and 
connects 
Detroit 
to 
Ironwood, 
in 
the 
upper 
peninsula. 
The 
specific 
section of the trail in Ann 
Arbor would pass through 
Ypsilanti and connect with 
Dexter.
Sanderson also mentioned 
the county has teamed up 
with and received funding 
from 
Huron 
Waterloo 
Pathways. He believes by 
getting the approval from 
the community now, the 
county can apply for grants 
sooner.
Hanzel 
went 
over 
the 
details of the tunnel. She 
told residents a feasibility 
study had been done and 
would be updated for a better 
estimate for grant funding. 
The 
city 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
also worked closely with 
construction companies to 
create accurate dimensions.
“We were thinking for 
dimensions 
approximately 
14 feet wide, 10 feet tall for 
the interior space,” Hanzel 
said. “We’d like to have 
lights on the interior. We’ll 
hopefully have the budget to 
improve the exterior.”
Construction 
may 
not 
start until 2020 or 2021. 
Following the presentation, 
the room was open for 
discussion and community 
members 
voiced 
their 
concerns on the timeline. 
Ann Arbor resident Kim 
Hill, 
who 
attended 
the 
meeting, told The Daily the 
city should put the issue on 
their list of priorities.
“I would like them to 
prioritize 
it,” 
Hill 
said. 
“It’s something that’s been 
obvious 
for 
years. 
They 
studied it back in 2005. 
They couldn’t get funding, 
is what they said. So now, 
you have this feasibility 
study already, you’re going 

to update the numbers, just 
concentrate on getting the 
money. I’m not worried it 
won’t happen, just worried 
it will take a little bit of time 
— longer than it probably 
should.”
Many 
residents 
were 
excited about the tunnel 
and trail. Ypsilanti resident 
Ashley Fox was especially 
excited 
about 
the 
trail 
connecting Ann Arbor and 
Ypsilanti.
“I just wanted to strongly 
endorse this project,” Fox 
said. “I think it’s a really 
important one and … I think 
it’s really important not just 
that this crossing would be 
there, but that we would 
have the path getting there 
clearer, especially coming 
from Fuller Road.”
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Valerie Shinebarger enjoys 
biking near the Barton Dam 
and looks forward to the 
idea of a bridge — part of the 
Border-to-Border trail — to 
help create a safer way to get 
to the park.
“I 
like 
what 
Peter 
Sanderson said: ‘It would be 
the gateway to Ann Arbor,’ 
because really there’s no 
way to bike to Dexter right 
now,” Shinebarger said. “I 
see people there all the time 
and I’m really excited to be 
able to do it safely because 
with MDOT putting more 
of these barriers to make 
people 
safer, 
it’s 
more 
dangerous because people 
are still doing it anyway, but 
now they’re having to jump 
over things and slide down 
a hill.”
Sanderson said he was 
pleased with the meeting, 
but 
understood 
there 
is 
always 
a 
possibility 
of 
opposition.
“I think the crowd seemed 
generally supportive of the 
project, but we’ll see what 
kind of comments we get 
back,” Sanderson said.

LSA freshman Rubani Walia, 
a member of MPowered, said she 
welcomes the results of the study, 
feeling empowered by the increased 
opportunity. 
“I definitely have seen a gender 
disparity in the business fields,” 
Walia said. “But when I joined 
MPowered and started gaining 
exposure to venture capitalists as 
well as those working in startups, 
I began to see a potential for that 
gender gap to close. Though I have 
always been confident in my ability 
to succeed in business regardless 
of my gender, it helps to know that 
there are women in Ann Arbor that 
I can look up to and turn to.”
While 
female 
investors 
and 
women-owned businesses are still 
underrepresented on the venture 
market, the study found the climate 
was 
steadily 
improving. 
After 
examining 
how 
startups 
with 
female founders performed after 
their first round of capital compared 
with those that did not, the study 
determined most had raised a 
second and third round within three 
to five years, some eventually going 
public. Those who went public did 
so at about the same rate as other 
startups without a female founder.
According to the study, Ann Arbor 
is the metro area with the largest 
share of these “first financings” 
secured by female startups.
Among the 19 cities with above-
average shares of women-founded 
startup activity, Ann Arbor topped 
the list. Between 2005 and 2017, 29 
percent of female startups secured a 
first round, compared to the national 
average of 16 percent. Holding 58 
percent of first financings, Ann 
Arbor had almost three times the 
national average of 21 percent of 
women-founded shares between 
2016 and 2017. Memphis, Boulder, 
and Honolulu had shares of about 40 
percent and St. Louis; Providence, 
Rhode Island; Tampa, Florida; and 
New Orleans were all around 30 
percent.
The cities identified in the study 
all had women-founded shares of 
startup activity greater than the 
country’s 
average 
percent 
and 
an average of at least four first 
financings each year from 2017 to 
2016 or from 2017 to 2005.
The study’s author, Ian Hathaway, 
noted in the report the bigger cities 
benefited from large established 
startup communities.

“Because these four cities are 
both large and gender diverse, 
they drive a substantial portion of 
women-founded startup activity 
overall,” Hathaway wrote.
Hathaway said this disparity 
could be because the number of 
female investors located in the 
region is much higher than a smaller 
city, or because the city supports 
industries that historically have had 
more companies founded by women. 
Sectors like consumer products and 
services, health care and software 
are among the industries with a 
larger share of female founders with 
venture-backed financing. 
Lucy Sanders, co-founder and 
CEO of the National Center for 
Women & Information Technology 
and author of the CAE report’s 
foreword, 
encouraged 
startup 
cities to create a more amenable 
community 
for 
female-founded 
companies. 
“Technology investors and other 
leaders, both men and women, must 
perform as champions for female 
technologists and entrepreneurs,” 
Sanders wrote in the report. “They 
must be informed and equipped 
to pass along their guidance and 
encouragement 
effectively, 
with 
a clear understanding of both the 
values and unique challenges to 
gender inclusion embedded in our 
current systems and operations.” 
According 
to 
Hathaway, 
mentorship programs or support 
groups to inspire young female 
entrepreneurs may be a way to 
start improvement. Business senior 
Hayley Rogers, co-president of 
Michigan Business Women, said a 
strong network of women is essential 
for aspiring entrepreneurs.
“Both the academic curriculum 
as well as the community in 
MBW push individuals to try and 
innovate,” Rogers said. “You feel like 
you can do anything, you are taught 
the basic skills of starting a business, 
and you have the resources and 
experiences of those around you — it 
makes starting a business seem like 
less of an obstacle.”
Rogers said it made sense Ann 
Arbor was one of the top places for 
women-led startups to prosper.
“I am not surprised by the 
findings of the study,” Rogers said. 
“Ann Arbor is and will always 
be a hotspot for learning. Given 
this atmosphere and the support 
available from the University of 
Michigan, I understand why female 
entrepreneurs can succeed.”

“Some of the people who are 
playing 
various 
community 
roles in the simulation are 
people 
who 
are 
formerly 
homeless, some are on public 
assistance,” 
Warpehoski 
said. “They bring a real-life 
experience to the role and to 
the simulation that can provide 
an authenticity and perspective 
that is difficult to bring in from 
just reading about it.”
During 
the 
simulation, 
each 
volunteer 
was 
given 
a 
specific 
community 
role 
to play, occupying the roles 
of 
policemen, 
employment 
officers 
and 
mortgage 
collectors.

Helen Simon, one of the 
simulation’s organizers, has 
been 
volunteering 
in 
ICPJ 
simulations since the 1990s. 
During 
the 
event, 
Simon 
managed 
“Quick 
Cash,” 
a 
location 
made 
up 
by 
the 
simulation’s 
organizers 
to 
give out food stamps and 
transportation 
passes 
to 
student participants.
According 
to 
Simon, 
volunteers 
were 
permitted, 
and in some cases, instructed, 
to make tasks more difficult 
for participants. For instance, 
several 
volunteers 
failed 
to provide work checks to 
participants due to long lines, 
or even cheated participants 
who were unaware of their 
rights.

“I think we try to make it as 
realistic as we can,” Simon said. 
“I’m a Quick Cash person and 
I’ve never done this particular 
job before, but (the simulation 
guide) says that if you can get 
away with it, try to cheat the 
person. I’m too kind-hearted, 
I’m not going to try and cheat, 
but evidently it does happen.”
LSA 
freshman 
Nathalie 
O’Hernandez was a student 
participant. 
According 
to 
O’Hernandez, the economic 
struggles 
faced 
by 
her 
simulation 
group 
were 
noticeably linked to factors of 
race and ethnicity.
“It’s something that I’ve 
noticed, 
especially 
with 
my identity — I’m Latina,” 
O’Hernandez said. “And our 

family 
(in 
the 
simulation), 
we’re the Perez family. And 
how many times has a police 
officer come up to us and 
harassed us, asking us what 
we’ve 
done? 
Why 
are 
we 
singled out in that sense?”
O’Hernandez 
said 
her 
perceptions about the biases 
of 
law 
enforcement 
and 
other public resources were 
intensified by her participation 
in the simulation Tuesday.
“It’s just really striking 
how 
the 
stereotypes 
you 
have about these different 
systems are really apparent,” 
O’Hernandez said. “Although 
we have reached a time where 
we are able to talk about these 
things, nothing has changed 
them.”

Mitcham reflected to The 
Daily after the event on the 
opportunity to engage with 
the speakers.
“The speakers are the 
best in their field, so it’s 
the best knowledge you can 
get.”
Mitcham said she left the 
event feeling more educated 
about heat-related issues.

“It’s something that I 
never had thought about,” 
Mitcham said. “You can 
see Michigan doesn’t have 
as many heat stroke cases 
as other states. It really 
hits you, because you don’t 
really see that here, so it 
placed me in the position of 
those people.”
A reception followed the 
event featuring student and 
community organizations, 
including 
the 
Citizens’ 
Climate Lobby and the U.S. 

Environmental Protection 
Agency’s 
SmartWay 
program. Koman invited 
these 
organizations 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
encouraging attendees to 
take action following the 
event.
“I think that students, 
faculty 
and 
staff, 
and 
community 
members, 
everyone needs to be acting 
in their everyday lives to 
be thinking deeply about 
their carbon footprint, how 

to make these changes,” 
Koman said. “We’ve got a lot 
of really exciting solutions 
coming, and we all need to 
be a part of them.”
Balbus echoed Koman’s 
emphasis 
on 
continued 
activism.
“You guys are citizens 
of the University, and you 
have a voice in decisions 
the University makes, and 
this is a big place with a lot 
of impact,” Balbus said.

Statistics 250 is one of 
the classes participating 
in the Reef pilot program. 
According 
to 
Brenda 
Gunderson, 
who 
is 
a 
statistics 
professor 
and 
coordinator for Statistics 
250, 
the 
class 
usually 
keeps 
up 
with 
new 
learning 
technology, 
as it was also an early 
adopter 
of 
the 
original 
iClickers. Gunderson said 
she appreciates the way 
the app anticipates her 
questions. 
“You can come up with 
some 
very 
good 
true-
false and multiple choice 
questions, 
but 
it 
also 
really does help to mimic 
sometimes the ways you’re 
going 
to 
ask 
questions 
in 
assessments 
or 
make 
them think and type up an 
answer,” Gunderson said.
Statistics 250 has been 
piloting 
Reef 
for 
two 
semesters. 
According 
to 
Gunderson, 
her 
students 
told her they found Reef 
to be more engaging than 
traditional 
remotes. 
LSA 
freshman 
Hannah 
Albee, 
a student in Gunderson’s 
lecture, 
said 
she 
enjoys 
the accessibility and wider 
variety of questions.
“(Reef) 
is 
pretty 
straightforward,” 
Albee 
said. “Honestly I don’t really 
have any complaints with it. 

It’s convenient.”
Albee added she hopes 
more classes use Reef. She 
was required to buy a remote 
for her comparative politics 
class 
last 
semester, 
but 
never used it because there 
were problems integrating 
it in the class. According to 
Albee, Reef seems easier to 
implement.
LSA 
senior 
and 
Instructional 
Consultant 
Anthony King approached 
Gunderson as well as other 
professors 
to 
offer 
the 
opportunity to participate 
in the pilot program. He 
explained how LSA started 
supporting 
iClickers 
10 
years ago and is cooperating 
with Macmillan Learning 
to 
test 
out 
Reef 
in 
14 
pilot 
courses 
within 
the 
Statistics; 
Biology; 
Psychology; Sociology; and 
Film, Television and Media 
departments.
LSA 
freshman 
Adam 
Ross’s biology courses this 
semester and last semester 
both used iClicker remotes. 
Ross expressed interest in 
using Reef.
“(Reef) sounds like a great 
idea,” Ross said. “It seems 
more 
convenient 
instead 
of having to worry about 
the batteries forgetting the 
clicker device. I’d totally be 
down to try it.” 
However, 
Reef 
also 
presents some challenges 
that could prove problematic 

for learning environments. 
Ross noted how Reef might 
disrupt grading systems.
“I 
had 
friends 
that 
would use Reef and not go 
to lecture and would just 
answer the questions from 
their computer when it was 
lecture time,” Ross said. “I 
could see why that might 
pose a problem in grading 
for attendance.”
Gunderson 
said 
Reef’s 
interface 
wasn’t 
too 
complicated, 
but 
some 
technical challenges came 
with its implementation last 
semester. Since the course 
is designed so students may 
attend any lecture during 
the 
week, 
Reef 
synced 
all students to the course 
rather than to each class 
section, creating some lag in 
the response system.
“In order for me to give 
good feedback, I want their 
thinking, and I want to see 
the results of the poll in real 
time, not after the fact,” 
Gunderson 
said. 
“There 
were a few glitches because 
of how big the course was. 
Many 
of 
these 
glitches 
were fixed for the current 
semester.”
The pricing model also 
varies between Reef and 
remotes. Whereas students 
can buy a iClicker remote 
for $39 at the Computer 
Showcase or get one used 
for a lower price, Reef is 
available for use free of 

charge in the pilot program. 
King 
explained 
students 
would have to pay a one-
year 
subscription 
fee 
of 
$23.99 to use the app if it 
were officially integrated 
into LSA classrooms.
“The business model for 
the 
cloud-based 
iClicker 
Reef assumes students pay 
for the software they use on 
their own laptops, tablets, or 
phones — this means paying 
for both a subscription and 
needing to have a compatible 
device,” 
King 
said. 
“We 
are 
currently 
exploring 
with Macmillan Learning 
whether 
institutional 
licenses might be an option 
and 
what 
the 
financial 
impact could potentially be. 
It’s premature to speculate 
on how much students might 
pay.”
King explained how LSA 
ultimately needs to weigh 
in on the different effects 
of student response systems 
before deciding if the system 
should be implemented.
“I want to be clear that 
there 
is 
no 
University-
wide ‘transition’ to iClicker 
Reef,” King said. “Individual 
schools 
and 
colleges 
determine 
what 
student 
response system is most 
appropriate for their faculty 
… for a variety of important 
reasons, some instructors 
may prefer to stay with the 
traditional iClicker device-
based version.”

M

y sophomore year of 
college, I decided 
to major in history 

instead of political science. To 
me, the switch from political 
science to history was a minor 
one, because I had always 
thought they were similar.

But 
that 
was 
not 
the 

perception a lot of people I 
knew had. Some of my friends 
and family seemed concerned 
that I was majoring in history. 
The impression I got from 
people 
was 
that 
political 

science 
was 
better 
than 

history because it was more 
employable, 
more 
relevant 

and more interesting. The 
concerns I encountered reflect 
broader trends in American 
higher education. These trends 
highlight two commonly held 
attacks on the humanities. 
One 
is 
that 
declaring 
a 

humanities major is asking for 
unemployment. And two, that 
the humanities are inferior and 
antiquated when compared to 
the social sciences.

Since 2007, the number of 

history majors in the U.S. has 
fallen more than 40 percent. 
There are even colleges that 
are getting rid of certain 
humanities 
subjects. 
Many 

look to the recession in 2008 to 
explain the dwindling interest 
in the humanities. Memory 
of the recession has made 
college students today deeply 
concerned about finding a 
stable job. So once in college, 
it makes sense that many 
millennials and Gen Z college 
students have opted out of 
the humanities, because in an 
economy often characterized 
as being in the midst of an 
information age, quantitative, 
data-based and technological 
skills seem more practical. 
What use is reading hundreds 
of pages about the French 
Revolution, philosophy or the 
modern canon when all the best 
jobs require quantitative skills?

This 
trend 
of 
favoring 

quantitative 
methods 
and 

skills is also evident within 
the liberal arts curriculum 
itself. Having spent almost 
four years on campus, as I 
alluded to earlier, it’s clear 
the social sciences are widely 
held in higher esteem than 
the humanities. Again, my 
experience 
seems 
to 
align 

with the overall trend on 
college campuses, as the social 
sciences have not experienced 
anywhere near the drop in 
enrollment 
the 
humanities 

have. In the information age, 
those who have chosen to major 
in a liberal arts subject are also 
swayed by an academic and 
cultural ethos that emphasizes 
data and quantitation.

First, 
the 
idea 
that 

humanities 
majors 
are 

unemployable 
relative 
to 

STEM or business majors is 
not true. In 2015, 4.3 percent 
of terminal bachelor’s degree 
holders in the humanities — 

meaning their highest level 
of education was undergrad 
— 
were 
unemployed, 

compared 
to 
3.6 
percent 

of 
all 
terminal 
bachelor’s 

degree holders, which is a 
minuscule 
difference. 
And 

while humanities majors do 
make less than business or 
engineering 
majors, 
many 

humanities majors report a 
high level of satisfaction with 
their salary and with their 
job. So the widely held claim 
that a humanities major is 
asking to spend years after 
college in a Starbucks or 
their parents’ basement is 
inaccurate and hyperbolic.

Second, the humanities can 

offer immense value to your 
college education and they are 
not an inferior version of the 
social sciences. I chose to study 
history because I’ve found that 
doing so has allowed me to 
think in a critical and informed 
way about the institutions, 
politics, debates and social 
realities that I interact with on 
a regular basis. Taking classes 
on the origins of Nazism and 
the 
Nazi’s 
racial 
ideology 

changed the way I thought 
about race and forced me to 
reconsider 
my 
previously 

colorblind mindset. It also 
showed me how ideologies in 
general work in conscious and 
unconscious ways.

A 
bevy 
of 
European 

history 
classes 
gave 
me 

the tools to understand the 
pillars of political liberalism, 
communism 
and 
fascism. 

They also taught me how 
liberal democracies can justify 
inequalities in the provision 
of rights that are ostensibly 
universal. A class on the history 
of media representation of 
Asian Americans allowed me 
to contextualize my mom’s 
family experience in America 
as 
immigrants 
from 
the 

Philippines. And a class on 
intellectual history exposed 
me to the influential ideas of 
19th century Europe’s most 
important thinkers, which I 
found relevant to political and 
moral questions today. These 
are just a few examples of the 
history classes I have taken 
that have enriched the way 
I think. Overall, the lens of 
historical analysis has forced 
me to reconsider a lot of the 

assumptions 
I 
had 
before 

starting college, leaving me 
happier, more open-minded 
and more informed. And while

and information, I’ve honed 
my ability to write, make an 
argument, analyze sources and 
do qualitative research.

The 
ability 
to 
think 

critically 
and 
historically 

about the pressing issues of 
our day is no less important 
today than it was a before the 
advent of the information age. 
STEM 
is 
obviously 
highly 

valuable 
and 
beneficial 
to 

society. We have STEM majors 
to thank for the fact that 
our 
scientific 
capabilities, 

from 
life-saving 
medicine 

to the latest technology, are 
greater than they have ever 
been. But the moral progress 
of the humanities does not 
match our scientific progress. 
The nature of the social and 
political problems we face are 
not fundamentally different 
from those of the past, despite 
the vastly improved scientific 
landscape we have today. It 
is this discrepancy, between 
moral 
and 
technological 

progress, that the humanities 
can offer unique succor and 
in which the social sciences 
fall short.

The social science classes 

I have taken have not only 
been interesting, but have 
also 
offered 
great 
insight 

into contemporary problems. 
However, in my experience, 
they tend to rely heavily on 
quantitation and ahistorical 
theories. While you can make 
observations about the natural 
world through randomized, 
controlled 
scientific 

experiments, making similar 
scientific 
observations 
and 

conclusions 
about 
humans 

is much harder. Modeling 
human behavior in political, 
social or economic contexts 
is hard because of human 
complexity. Research tells us 
that humans are not as rational 
as we once thought and that 
emotions and reason often 
converge to make decisions 
in our brains, challenging 
the validity of rational choice 
theory prevalent in social 
science theories. While the 
social sciences can provide 
insight 
based 
on 
studies, 

quantitative 
analysis 
and 

models, they should not be 
seen 
as 
conclusive 
given 

the 
complexity 
of 
human 

behavior. This is where history 
and the greater humanities 
come in, to use critical and 
analytical qualitative skills 
to understand human society 
and the moral and political 
choices we have, in ways that 
a 
quantitative 
analysis 
or 

predictive model cannot fully 
explicate.

Exercise competition is toxic

L

aying my mat on the 
ground, I look left and 
right 
observing 
those 

around me. I take a seat as I try 
to adjust to the hot temperature 
of the room. The instructor walks 
in and motions for us to begin in 
child’s pose. As I slide in, I can’t 
help but look at the woman in 
front of me. Is my butt supposed 
to be as low to the ground as hers? 
We begin to hold long balancing 
poses, and I shake trying to hold 
mine longer than those behind 
me so they can see how talented 
I am. We reach the end of class in 
corpse pose, where you literally 
do nothing but lie on your mat, 
and my instructor reminds us that 
“you are exactly where you are 
supposed to be.” I repeat this in 
my head as I struggle to stay still 
for the next 5 minutes.

In yoga classes, on my own 

at the gym or walking in heavy 
foot traffic to my 10 a.m. class, I 
struggle to fight the competition 
and comparison I create between 
myself, friends and complete 
strangers. 
Recently, 
after 

overcoming my fear of the gym, 
I realized these settings have a 
competitive atmosphere due to 
the way your workout is measured 
on the machines and the way 
people present themselves in the 
weight room. And overall, I have 
found this competitive energy and 
this mindset makes these physical 
activities extremely unenjoyable.

Now, I wouldn’t say I am the 

competitive type. My parents 
always tell stories of me playing 
middle school basketball where 
instead of focusing on the ball 
going down the court, I was 
preoccupied with playing with 
my hair. Looking back, all I 
remember was the joy of playing 
with my friends and physically 
feeling good after a practice. So, 
how come I really enjoyed myself 
in a competitive setting then, but 
when exercising today, I find this 
competition so unbearable?

In the past, when I used to 

go to work out, there was always 
an underlying goal to get as fit as 
possible or to lose weight. There 
were periods of time when I took 

my exercise very seriously, and 
looking back, I would say it was 
particularly harmful. I hated the 
entire process of working out 
and how I felt before going to do 
these activities. During and even 
after, I never felt the endorphins 
rush the way others around me 
experienced it. Usually, I would 
do a particular physical activity 
every day for a few months 
and then fall out of it from 
injury, lack of interest or lack of 
results I wanted. There was no 
sustainability in the expectations 
I had for myself because they were 
so unattainable with this mindset.

I think I developed this way 

of thinking from how our society 
glorifies fitness, health and being 
athletic. We are socialized from 
a young age in physical activities 
and in school gym classes that 
to be healthy and fit, we should 
be active. But when particular 
children 
feel 
discouraged, 

targeted 
and 
uncomfortable 

in these programs, it should 
be a clear public concern. Last 
semester, when researching for a 
project on fatphobia, I found out 
when physical education teachers 
have a bias toward against fat 
students, these individuals begin 
avoiding physical activities, and 
this can impact their relationship 
with their bodies and ultimately 
their mental and physical health.

So, we receive messages from 

a young age that the only way to 
be fit and healthy is to work out, 
be active and do this as much as 
possible until we get the expected 
results of what healthy looks like. 
But what if we never get the results 
we dream of because healthy looks 
different for each body? I think 
the influence of this education 
is where the comparison game 
begins and where we develop 
this 
competition 
between 

ourselves and those around us. 
And this happens especially in 
environments like the gym or 
workout classes, where some 
become super fit and get the 
results they expect while others 
struggle to fit this norm because 
their bodies may not be able to get 
to the same point.

This competitive, comparison 

mindset in physical exercise is 
toxic and leads to people pushing 
themselves too far, thus hurting 
themselves physically, or avoiding 
these activities in general, which 
hinders them from gaining the 
actual benefits from physical 
activity. Last semester, with my 
busy schedule, I rarely found time 
to be physically active and did not 
think much about it until I found 
myself extremely stressed out. 
Close to finals, one of my friends 
encouraged me to go to the gym 
with her to just sweat out all of 
our stress. I recognized, probably 
for the first time, how good it 
felt to sweat and feel the rush of 
endorphins.

From that point on, I decided 

I will not allow this competitive, 
comparison mindset to influence 
the way I engage in physical 
activity. It does not benefit 
my lifestyle because it turns 
out I actually like moving my 
body and the way it makes me 
feel. This means I am actively 
deciding to not care about what 
others are doing or think of me 
in an exercise setting. It has 
already been a challenge, but 
I have noticed that everyone 
is truly focused on themselves 
and do not care about what I am 
doing at all.

The people around me are 

not my competition. I try to find 
joy in physical activity because, 
ultimately, isn’t its purpose to 
make me feel better? Whether 
moving my body will make 
me fit or healthy, it makes me 
feel happy and gives me space 
to relieve myself from stress 
and clear my mind. I think we 
should all challenge ourselves 
to be kind, goofy and silly with 
one another and ourselves at 
the gym, in workout classes or 
on a quick walk running late to 
class. Because most of us are 
not training to become serious 
athletes and would benefit from 
the fun and joy of just moving our 
bodies as we please.

P

eople don’t care about 
data privacy. This is 
the explanation of some 

analysts for why there hasn’t 
been a boycott against the big 
internet companies. If people 
cared, surely scandals like 
when Facebook leaked the 
personal data of 50 million 
Americans 
to 
Cambridge 

Analytica, 
or 
reports 
that 

Google 
secretly 
purchased 

financial data to track users’ 
purchases would’ve led to 
some sort of departure from 
these platforms by now.

The 
problem: 
It 
seems 

people do care. The Pew 
Research Center found that 
80 percent of users were 
concerned about businesses 
and advertisers accessing the 
data they share on social media 
platforms. 
Furthermore, 
61 

percent of users said they 
would like to do more to 
protect their privacy.

So 
why 
haven’t 
people 

stopped 
using 
Google 
or 

Facebook?

Because there aren’t viable 

alternatives. Sure, there are a 
number of companies that aim 
to provide privacy as part of 
their product — Duck Duck Go 
for your search engine, Signal 
for messaging, FastMail for 
email. However, the costs of 
switching make it unrealistic 
for most people.

For example, if you want 

to use Signal for messaging, 
you would have to convince 
each 
person 
you 
message 

with on Facebook Messenger, 
WhatsApp, etc., to switch over 
to Signal in order to message 
them. To use FastMail for 
email, it costs $30 per year 
minimum. Additionally, there 
is the hassle of transferring 
contacts, photos and prior data 

to these new services.

Why 
aren’t 
there 
real 

alternatives? The nature of 
many tech companies means 
the value of their products 
increase as more people use 
them. This makes challenging 
the big tech firms a herculean 
task, as not only do you 
need a competitive product, 

you also need to be able to 
overcome a massive user base 
disadvantage (almost a third 
of 
the 
world’s 
population 

uses 
Facebook). 
Further 

exacerbating this situation is 
one from the the wide array of 
anti-competitive actions that 
tech companies employ.

For 
instance, 
tech 

companies 
often 
use 

acquisitions 
to 
snuff 
out 

potential 
competition 
and 

expand into new industries. 
Many 
of 
Google’s 
central 

products such as YouTube, 
Android 
and 
DoubleClick 

(Google’s ad service) were 
acquired as start-ups. Forays 
into new technologies such 
as the internet of things and 
artificial 
intelligence 
were 

jump-started by purchases as 
well — Nest and DeepMind 
respectively. 
Furthermore, 

companies 
that 
compete 

with Google’s products face 
challenges including Google 
wielding its product arsenal to 
place them at a disadvantage, 
like when Google manipulated 
search results to promote its own 
services and demote competitors 
offering similar services.

This 
pattern 
of 
anti-

competitive 
actions 
can 

be found across the tech 
giants. Whether it’s Amazon 
purposefully 
hemorrhaging 

hundreds 
of 
millions 
of 

dollars to force an acquisition, 
or 
Facebook 
purchasing 

potential 
competitors 
like 

WhatsApp 
and 
Instagram, 

anti-competitiveness is a core 
feature of the big internet 
companies’ business models. 
These practices make it difficult 
for consumers to influence 
the 
marketplace, 
reducing 

their ability to hold companies 
accountable by taking their 
business elsewhere.

There 
are 
signs 
that 

tech companies’ bigness is 
starting to be noticed. In the 
European Union, Google faces 
two fines due to anti-trust 
violations — each with a price 
tag over $2 billion. U.S. Sen. 
Amy 
Klobuchar, 
D-Minn., 

a presidential candidate for 

2020, has introduced antitrust 
legislation that includes a ban 
on acquisitions for companies 
with a market capitalization 
above $100 billion (Facebook, 
Google and Amazon all have 
market 
capitalizations 
well 

above 
$100 
billion). 
Lina 

Khan, an academic fellow 
at Columbia University and 
a former legal fellow at the 
Federal Trade Commission, 
has proposed a new legal 
theory, which contends that 
even when monopolies appear 
to 
benefit 
consumers 
by 

offering free services or low 
prices, they can still be deeply 
harmful. She argues that these 
monopolies can distort not just 
markets, but American life, 
through things like enormous 
tax cuts, commissioned studies 
and 
aggressive 
lobbying 

(Amazon’s 
HQ2 
debacle 

illustrates this perfectly).

To put power back in 

consumers’ hands, the tech 
giants should be treated as 
the behemoths that they are. 
Unrestrained expansion has 
made consumers powerless 
to 
influence 
the 
market 

with their choices, and now 
government must step in on 
their behalf with oversight 
and regulations that hold 
companies 
accountable. 

The scale of the largest tech 
companies has given us free 
services 
and 
revolutionary 

products, but that scale has 
externalities that must be 
dealt with.

It’s a mistake to interpret 

consumers’ inaction in the 
tech 
industry 
as 
apathy. 

People truly care about their 
privacy 
on 
the 
internet, 

but 
the 
current 
situation 

makes 
action 
unrealistic 

for many. Until the tech 
industry becomes a properly 
functioning market — or is 
regulated like a public utility 
— consumers will be stuck 
between a rock and a hard 
place.

Why no one quits Google or Facebook

Don’t let the humanities die

I’ve honed 
my ability to 
write, make 
an argument, 
analyze sources 
and so qualitative 

research


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Wednesday, February 27, 2019 — 5A

We live in a society that 
seems to be facing an issue that 
previous generations probably 
would have never imagined: 
an overwhelming amount of 
information. With the internet 
becoming a central aspect in 
everyone’s life, the way we 
interact with one another has 
become different as well. In 
the School of Music, Theatre 
& 
Dance’s 
production 
of 
Caryl Churchill’s “Love and 
Information,” 
director 
Gillian 
Eaton 
asks 
the 
audience, “Can we 
resist the constant 
distraction? 
Is 
paying 
attention 
the most profound 
expression 
of 
love? 
How 
much 
information do we 
need?” I think the 
production reflects 
favorably 
upon 
these questions.
One of the unique 
aspects 
of 
“Love 
and 
Information” 
was 
the 
lack 
of 
characters 
— 
or, 
I guess one could 
say the abundance of them. 
Each of these short scenes 
compares a different set of 
unnamed characters. For the 
most part, characters were 
given very little exposition, and 
there was very little time to 
explore the characters, as per 
the nature of the play. Each of 
the dozens of characters was 
distinctly different, and each 
was portrayed incredibly well 
by the talented cast.
The performance consisted 
of dozens of different vignettes, 
each about one to two minutes 
long 
with 
varying 
subject 
matters. 
Sometimes, 
these 
scenes were accompanied by 
titles projected above the stage 
which would give the audience 
insight as to the subject of 
the different tableaux. One of 
the first scenes featured two 
teenagers that seemed to be 
smoking some sort of substance 
and filling out their census. If 

I had not known that the scene 
was called “Census” I would 
have just assumed two stoners 
were talking about nothing 
and giggling. But because the 
context was provided by that 
title, the scene became more 
focused, and more lighthearted. 
However, 
sometimes 
these 
titles were vague or just non-
existent.
As the show went on, different 
tones were introduced. There 
were multiple vignettes that 
centered around a character 
lacking the ability to feel some 
sort of emotion, from grief to 

pain and everything in between. 
More than once this was a child 
of some sort not knowing what 
it was like to feel a certain 
way, but also included adults 
watching television and failing 
to feel any empathy. I thought 
this 
element 
of 
emotional 
analysis 
was 
one 
of 
the 
highlights of the performance. 
Each actor had a tough job to 
do in conveying the complex 
emotions of a character that the 
audience knew nothing about, 
but I took a lot away from the 
play’s commentary on human 
emotions, and how although 
some of them may seem to be 
dreadful, they all help shape us 
to be human.
I was not a huge fan of 
the usage of cellphones and 
popular music. Seeing two of 
the actors recite the entirety 
of “Man’s Not Hot” by Big Shaq 
(which 
I 
admittedly 
found 
pretty impressive) ruined the 

immersion for me. It felt out of 
place. Most of these vignettes 
conveyed 
emotions 
and 
experiences that felt timeless 
and relatable. I understand 
that the production was meant 
to analyze the current age of 
information, but having modern 
day songs and phones on stage 
took away this feeling that 
these scenes could be applicable 
to human emotion on a broader 
scale. The phones didn’t really 
emerge as a plot device in many 
of the scenes; they just seemed 
like they were there, and they 
were distracting. They felt like 
a red sock in a load of 
white shirts.
One of the aspects 
of the show I enjoyed 
the most was how 
love 
wasn’t 
always 
treated in a romantic 
sense. Sometimes it 
was a paternal love, 
or a close friendship. 
There was a scene 
where one character 
argued with another 
about the legitimacy of 
an online relationship 
with some sort of 
A.I., 
taking 
heavy 
influence from Spike 
Jonze’s “Her.” This 
to me was one of the 
best 
vignettes 
that 
explored the concept of emotion 
while integrating technology.
“Love and Information” was 
a really weird play — in a good 
way. One of my favorite elements 
about 
theater 
is 
how 
real 
character development can feel 
in a live setting. And despite the 
premise of this play lacking any 
sort of character development, 
I enjoyed it. Even for the two 
minutes that a reunited couple 
returned to the stage, I almost 
felt like I knew every step of 
their relationship. Topics like 
memory loss really hit home 
with me with a family prone 
to dementia, but before I had a 
second for that sentimentality 
to kick in, the next scene would 
have me laughing out loud. 
The Department of Theatre & 
Drama’s production of “Love 
and 
Information” 
wasn’t 
perfect, but I didn’t want it to 
be. It was human, and that’s all 
an audience could have wanted.

‘Love and Information,’ for
our own age of information

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Vern Smith’s “The Green 
Ghetto” is an urban western 
set in a fictional Detroit 
neighborhood 
where 
the 
protagonist, 
Mitchell 
Hosowich, freely grows and 
sells dope (ganja, weed, you 
name it) out of an abandoned 
drug-slinging 
paradise. 
His 
paradise is short-
lived, as the year 
is 2002, marijuana 
is legal nowhere, 
and 
consequently 
the DEA has come 
to town to take 
Hosowich on the 
cross-border 
drug 
chase of his life. 
Vern Smith, a man 
who grew up with 
a close relationship 
to 
Detroit 
from 
across 
the 
river 
in 
Windsor, 
Ontario, 
will 
be 
visiting 
Literati 
this Thursday to 
do a reading from 
this 
humorously 
unadulterated 
look 
at 
life 
in 
post-9/11, war-on-
drugs America and 
Canada.
Smith’s 
“Green 
Ghetto” 
was 
released 
to 
the 
public two weeks 
ago, and has since started his 
tour cross the the U.S. and 
Canada to publicize the book.
During a phone interview 
with The Daily, Smith spoke 
about 
preparing 
for 
his 
upcoming tour: “So far, so 
good,” he stated, remarking 
that he hadn’t yet left Chicago, 
his current place of residence, 
but was raring to hit bars 
across the country to hear how 
his book was being received.
Smith 
had 
previously 
worked at four newspapers and 
three magazines, as well as at 
CJAM 99.1, Windsor, Ontario’s 
local radio broadcast out of 
the University of Windsor. 
It was here that he became 
“something of an accidental 
musicologist.” Working both 

as a reporter and broadcaster 
had a strong influence on 
Smith as a fiction writer.
“I’m not coming at (the 
book) 
as 
an 
activist, 
but 
more as an old, hard-nosed 
reporter,” Smith said.
Having worked for years in 
the newspaper business (until 
2002), Smith had little patience 
for the kind of hysteria-
provoking 
government 

policy and subsequent mass 
media coverage that came 
about in the years following 
9/11. This kind of hysteria 
only supplemented the real 
everyday problems Smith and 
others experienced.
One uninvited effect of 
this was increased border 
security between the U.S. 
and Canada that would have 
likely rendered Smith’s secret 
trips over to Detroit to see the 
Tigers play when he was 11 
impossible. Once he started 
making these trips, they hardly 
stopped until Smith moved out 
of Windsor for good.
“I found culture there, I had 
relationships there … I can’t 
tell you how many shows I saw 
there,” said Smith on Detroit 

in the late ’80s and early ’90s. 
And now more than ever 
hysteria reigns king.
This is why Smith chose 
to set the book when he did. 
9/11 marked the beginnings 
of much of the illogical policy 
making and press hype that 
plague us today. Although the 
book doesn’t delve into detail 
on the war on terrorism, it’s 
understood that this war goes 
hand in hand with 
the war on drugs 
that 
the 
book 
so 
absurdly 
depicts. 
And, although it may 
seem that in recent 
years certain parties 
have come around 
to 
acknowledging 
this 
war’s 
failure 
with the advent of 
legal marijuana in 
several U.S. states 
and Canada, Smith 
remains 
insistent 
that 
both 
federal 
governments 
are 
irrational 
as 
ever 
about it.
“Everyone’s 
so 
high on access at 
home 
they 
don’t 
notice 
there 
are 
100 new ways to 
get arrested for it,” 
Smith 
said, 
citing 
that a 19-year-old in 
Canada could by law 
see up to 14 years in 
prison for passing a 
joint to a 17-year-old. 
He also noted that 
just today on the front cover 
of the Canadian newspaper 
the National Post, a story 
broke on cannabis being the 
leading cause of road deaths 
in Canada. This was according 
to the CEO of Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving Canada.
Marijuana 
policy 
is 
far 
from the only issue on the 
table here. For Smith, it seems 
more a metaphor for the larger 
picture. Plus, it makes for a 
hell of a story: drug-slinging 
cowboy rides the high of failed 
city policy only to high-tail it 
out of, not just the city, but the 
country for fear of losing his 
life to federal agency cronies 
for growing ganja. How does 
it end? You’ll just have to be 
there on Thursday at 7 p.m.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

“Yeah, ayy / And her pussy 
tastes like Skittles / What? 
Yeah, ayy / You can really taste 
the rainbow.”
Who could have penned this 
work? Shakespeare? Dickinson? 
Dostoevsky?
Nope. Just a humble guy 
named 
Lil 
Xan, 
spitting 
poetry 
over 
the 
gentle 
caress 
of 
a Bobby Johnson 
instrumental.
I don’t think I’m 
going too far out on 
a limb to request 
for him to at least 
be considered for 
a Nobel Prize in 
Literature. 
The 
only 
musician 
to 
have received this 
high honor to date 
is Bob Dylan, who, 
as far as I can tell, 
has written no lines 
about pussy. Dylan 
has been around for about half a 
century and released 35 albums, 
only like four to five of which 
are actually any good. None 
of them contain any Bobby 
Johnson beats. I checked.
It is hard to think of two 
artists more similar than Lil 
Xan and Bob Dylan, but that is 
not to say that they don’t have 
their differences. For example, 
Bob Dylan has yet to publicly 
condemn Xanax. One point for 
Lil Xan. Lil Xan was also once 
hospitalized because he ate too 
many Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, 
which is more self-destructive 
and interesting than anything 
Bob Dylan has ever done in 
his life (other than releasing 

Knocked Out Loaded). Only one 
of these artists has released any 
terrible, preachy contemporary 
Christian albums in a bizarre 
mid-career pivot so far, every 
conceivable metric is coming up 
in favor of Lil Xan.
Bob Dylan seems to think 
that good storytelling primarily 
consists of having a lot of 
different characters, whereas 
Lil Xan’s literary theory is 

centered around drugs and sex, 
both of which are undeniably 
more interesting than railroad 
men or whatever. Dylan is 
considered 
“counterculture,” 
but all of his fans freaked out 
and called him “Judas” when 
he used an electric guitar. 
He doesn’t even have any 
face tattoos (+1 for Lil Xan) — 
rebellion for Dylan consisted 
of wearing really ugly jackets 
and sunglasses while smoking 
weed and lying about having 
a 
heroin 
addiction. 
He 
is 
also 
a 
notoriously 
terrible 
live performer (to the point 
where 
some 
of 
his 
songs 
are 
unrecognizable) 
who 
deliberately 
antagonizes 
his 

fans. Lil Xan, on the other hand, 
is so accommodating that he 
allows his fans to beat him up 
after his shows.
I will concede that Lil Xan 
does not have the edge on Bob 
Dylan in every category they 
are tied in both their singing 
ability and their primitive and 
strophic song structures. Bob 
Dylan’s voice was, at its best, 
nasally and challenging. At its 
worst, 
especially 
towards 
the 
end 
of his career, it is 
redolent of the howl 
of a dog whose tail 
has been stepped on. 
Lil Xan is not much 
better, but at least 
he has put out less 
music.
Lil Xan has never 
been one for sacred 
cows, and Bob Dylan 
is just the latest of 
the old guard to 
fall at the hands of 
a new challenger. I 
cannot help but be 
reminded of the Percy Bysshe 
Shelley poem “Ozymandias”:
“My name is Ozymandias, 
King of Kings;
Look 
on 
my 
Works, 
ye 
Mighty, and despair!
Nothing 
beside 
remains. 
Round the decay
Of 
that 
colossal 
Wreck, 
boundless and bare
The lone and level sands 
stretch far away.”
Legends 
always 
fade. 
Although it might be difficult 
to imagine now, one day Lil 
Xan will fall from grace. Much 
like how he has rendered Bob 
Dylan irrelevant, Lil Xan’s great 
works will too be swept away by 
the sands of time.

I talk about improv comedy 
constantly, so much so that people 
will actively tell me to stop talking 
about it. But I can’t help it, I’m 
obsessed. For those of you who don’t 
know, I do improv. I apply improv 
concepts to everyday situations. Yes, I 
“Yes, and” my way through life. Once 
my brother told me I sounded like I 
was talking about psychedelics when 
I was talking solely about improv, and 
thus spawned the birth of this listicle. 
Because honestly, it changed my 
life. So whether you love tripping on 
magic mushrooms or have the hots 
for Jason Mantzoukas, enjoy these 
descriptions.
It’s OK alone, but much better in a 
group setting.
Some people even use it as therapy.
Your mom doesn’t get it.
It’s really popular in Chicago.
Your friend Tyler tried it once and 
won’t shut up about it.
It really taught me to trust myself.
It changed my life.
It’s a gateway drug.
It makes you really confident.
It 
makes 
you 
exceedingly 
annoying to be around.
I heard it feels like flying.
You had to be there.
It’s hard to explain if you weren’t 
there, you know?
Apparently it turns your life 
around.
There are so many books written 
about it.
It’s like an altered state of 
consciousness.
It’s illegal in some countries.
Frankly, 
it 
was 
a 
religious 
experience for me.
It 
does 
something 
to 
your 
serotonin levels.
There are podcasts dedicated to it.

It was really big in the 1970s.
It 
diminishes 
anxiety 
and 
depression.
I couldn’t stop laughing the entire 
time.
It 
helps 
you 

unlock the unused depths of the 
human mind.
The experience itself is hard to 
explain.
Watching someone else do isn’t 
the same as doing it yourself.
The come-down is rough.
Robin Williams said, “sometimes 
it works, sometimes it doesn’t, but 
when it does, it’s like open-field 
running.”
Some would say it’s a sub-culture.
All my favorite celebrities have 
done it.
Most comedians start out by doing 
it.
Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are big 
fans of it.
I heard 80 percent of those who 
have done it said it was one of the top 
five most meaningful experiences of 
their lives.
And 50 percent said it was the 
most meaningful experience, like, 
ever.

The 
risks 
are 
incredibly 
exaggerated.
Nixon was not a fan.
It’s safer than alcohol.
Steve Jobs once said it was, “one of 
the most important things (I did) in 
my life.”
My dad said he tried it once in 
college.
About 1.31 million 18 to 25-year-
olds admitted to trying it in 2017.
A lot of people have turned to it for 
comfort after the 2016 election.
People like that it takes you away 
from your phone for a while.
It’s easier to obtain now more than 
ever thanks to the Internet.
Women are getting more involved 
in it.
It helps you reconnect with people 
and the world.
If politicians did it, we would all be 
better off.
It’s a form of escapism.
It makes the world a bit more 
magical and beautiful.
There are three clubs for it at The 
University of Michigan.
You want to try it, but don’t know 
where to start.
You heard it’s only for people who 
listen to Phish.
It might make you feel a little 
dizzy.
It’s best to fast before your first 
time.
You should watch someone else 
do it before you do it yourself so you 
know what to expect.
You’ve seen posters for it around 
campus but don’t fully get it.
It’s mostly a college kid thing, like 
a Capella.
People don’t really enjoy it; they 
just say they do to make their friends 
who actually do it feel better.

Is it improv comedy, or is 
it simply the psychedelics?

THERE’S A
CROSSWORD
ON THIS
PAGE.

DO
IT.

Not far south of the Michigan 
border, near the Indiana Dunes 
National Lakeshore, is a town in 
northern Indiana called Dune 
Acres. The town shares its 
name with the newest piece by 
composer Kristin Kuster, which 
premiered just this past week 
through the Detroit Symphony 
Orchestra.
Of course, this is no coincidence. 
Kuster, the chair of composition at 
the University of Michigan School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, spent 
many summers in Dune Acres 
as a child, at her grandparents’ 
house. The new “Dune Acres” 
piece isn’t the first she’s written 
inspired by that setting — notably, 
her 2013 vibraphone solo piece, 
“Rain Chain,” was inspired by a 
rain chain there — and it marks 
a return to natural themes that 
have long formed important 
preoccupations in her work.
“I think I’m at my most calm 
and focused when I’m looking 
at trees,” Kuster said in a recent 
interview with The Daily. “Or 
looking at water, or looking at 
nature. It’s a real inspiration 
for me, because there’s so many 
things that are so beautiful.”
This practice extends to her 
work at the University, where 
she says she sometimes gives 
students assignments to set aside 
an hour, go to the Arb, and stare 
at a tree. The goal is to “notice the 
branches and the leaves and the 
way it looks, even if it’s winter and 
it’s got snow and there aren’t any 
leaves or whatever.”
“I think that it can rewire our 
brains away from the kind of 
chaos of the world,” Kuster said. 
“We get an enormous amount of 
input as we walk through the day. 
Even just people on the street, 
sights and sounds, conversations 
and things, to-do lists ... It works 
for me, anyway, to just relax. And 
kind of find stillness in looking at 
natural beauty around us.”
Kuster 
has 
long 
been 
accustomed to natural beauty, 
through her childhood growing 
up in Boulder, Colo., and her 
experiences later on living in 
San Diego and now Michigan. 
This priority she mentions of 
escaping from the “input” and 

stress of the world, she said, was 
a major element that affected her 
approach to “Dune Acres.”
“Part of what prompted me 
to go back to that space is that 
I’ve been pretty torqued up and 
upset with what’s happening in 
the world,” she said. “I wanted 
to get back to that kind of joyful, 
childlike wonderment at the 
world. This is the place where I 
really started writing music as 
a little kid, making up sounds, 
running around the house and 
running around on the beach. 
I was so fond of the time that I 
spent there that I really wanted to 
tap back into that in this piece, as 
a way to sort of cope with the state 
of things.”
Many of Kuster’s goals — as 
a chair of composition and, it 
seems, as an active member of the 
composing community in general 
— align with this idea of addressing 
recent political developments in 
the world. She aims to advocate 
for 
underrepresented 
groups 
in composition, and believes 
that this is work that the entire 
classical music community needs 
to undertake, particularly in large 
and well-funded institutions such 
as orchestra, opera, film music 
and gaming music.
“All 
of 
those 
institutions 
have a problem with diversity of 
representation,” Kuster said. “And 
yes, it is better than it was five, ten 
years ago, but we still need these 
institutions to care, and to do 
the work. And it really only takes 
one person in an organization to 
care, and spend fifteen minutes 
Googling. It’s really not that 
much work, but someone has to 
care about putting forth art that 
represents composers of color, 
female composers, composers 
who identify as female, trans 
composers, 
composers 
with 
disabilities ... We are seeing a little 
bit of progress, and there are some 
organizations that are better than 
others. But until we do that, it’s 
just going to stagnate.”
Some 
of 
the 
social 
and 
environmental 
problems 
entrenched in the world are ones 
that find their way into Kuster’s 
music itself. When she wrote a 
different nature-inspired piece, 
“Devil’s Thumb,” in 2013, she was 
thinking about the devastation 
incurred by weeks’ worth of 
wildfires in Colorado, as well as 

the 2012 shooting at the Aurora 
movie theater.
“We had been seeing this pain 
in Colorado, and yet there’s so 
much beauty around. So I guess 
when I approach that musically, 
you know, I can have sections that 
are sort of dark and heavy and 
powerful, with lots of percussion. 
And then when there are beautiful 
things, it can be maybe slower 
and more lyrical, with longer 
melodies,” Kuster said.
The new piece, “Dune Acres,” 
also maneuvers through differing 
melodies and musical sensibilities. 
The piece is in three movements, 
segmented 
by 
an 
imagined 
journey to the eponymous beach.
“The first movement is mostly 
about my memory of being really 
excited to go on this trip,” Kuster 
said. “My two older sisters and 
I would pile into the back of the 
old station wagon with no air 
conditioning, and drive for two 
days to the northwest part of 
Indiana, and just excitement and 
the anticipation, and also just 
watching the world go by through 
Nebraska and Iowa and Indiana.”
The second movement she 
describes as slower and sadder, 
with 
a 
long 
trumpet 
solo 
throughout to denote Kuster’s 
memory of “fog rolling in over 
the lake.” This is the movement 
where 
Kuster 
begins 
to 
incorporate more environmental 
preoccupations into the piece, 
mirroring her fascination with 
the natural world.
“We’re in danger of destroying 
these Great Lakes right now,” 
she said. “And Flint still doesn’t 
have clean water, and we’re 
surrounded by all this fresh water. 
So it’s kind of a lament to the state 
that we’re in now, and in concern 
for where we’ll be in the future 
with these Great Lakes.”
The third and final movement 
brings the piece to a close on a 
faster-paced note.
“It’s just this really pulsing, 
happy, kind of wash of sound. 
And that is, I think, just reflecting 
my memory of jumping in a lake. 
Whether it’s cold or warm, you 
gotta get in there and splash 
around when you’re a little kid,” 
Kuster said.

Kuster on ‘Dune Acres’

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

What were Desus Nice and The Kid Mero up 
to on the premiere of their new weekly late-night 
talk show on Showtime? Oh, a little of everything: 
comparing Barack Obama to a Dominican 
grandfather at a wedding, parodying “Green 
Book,” critiquing Vladimir Putin’s judo skills, 
taking a jab at New York sports radio legend-slash-
irritant Mike Francesa and talking marginal tax 
rates with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
So, no, it wasn’t a huge departure from what 
the duo has been doing for the last two years on 
Viceland, where their show aired four days a 
week. And that’s precisely what makes “Desus and 
Mero” a perfect, much-needed addition to late-
night TV — a genre now sufficiently haunted with 
the ghosts of would-be revolutionaries who never 
managed to crack the code.
The late-night problem, of course, is that the 
format doesn’t allow for much creativity. The 
attempts at departures from the White Man 
Behind Desk Chatting With Guest on Adjacent 
Couch™ trope have all felt fairly tepid and 
uninspired: white man behind desk with no guests, 
white woman on couch with guests, white woman 
standing in front of a screen, brown man standing 
in front of a screen (no disrespect, Hasan, big fan). 
Much of the appeal of “Desus and Mero” is that it 

isn’t explicitly promising to turn the medium 
upside down or to be completely experimental — 
the two just want to riff a little, laugh a little and 
maybe talk to some interesting people along the 
way.
The result is a show that’s completely free of 
gimmicks or pretensions, essentially just two funny 
people in freewheeling conversation. They’ve 
foregone the clunky monologue and house band. 
Instead, the two begin the show in armchairs on a 
grunge-cool set, talking about the week’s news — a 
healthy mix of politics, sports and bizarre internet 
curiosities — with a few lively pre-taped bits 
sprinkled in between. Desus and Mero launched 
their comedy careers as Twitter personalities and 
that rings true in their humor, which is biting and 
goofy, manic and irreverent all at once. Clean, 
smart editing helps the half hour move along at a 
nimble but comfortable pace (though it does seem 
a shame this only airs once a week).
That Ocasio-Cortez was the first guest on 
“Desus and Mero” feels very fitting. The three 
of them are all up to the same thing right 
now: bringing their Bronx realness to stodgy 
institutions and conventions we take for granted. 
The conversation with her was fun, but sincere 
and substantive. And with two comedians on 
either side of her, the congresswoman more than 
held her own in the laughs department. “How 
do you have a computer that runs both Windows 
’95 and Twitter at the same time?” she wondered 
aloud about her antiquated meme-making Twitter 
critics. Later, they played a pre-taped segment of 
Desus and Mero’s visit to Ocasio-Cortez’s office 
in Washington D.C. The two came bearing gifts, 
some Fabuloso all-purpose cleaner, a copy of AM 
New York and the pièce de résistance: a giant Cardi 
B wall decal.

TV REVIEW

‘Desus and 
Mero’

Showtime

Pilot

Thursdays @ 11 p.m.

Early in her latest thriller, 
“The Lost Man,” Jane Harper 
introduces a legend about 
a 
stockman. 
It 
goes 
like 
this: In the 1890s there was 
a stockman, but he wasn’t 
exactly a stockman. He was 
a 
cattle 
rustler. 
He would take his 
horses in the wide, 
empty space of the 
arid 
Australian 
land 
and 
round 
loose cattle to sell 
them for cheap.
One 
day, 
the 
horses 
go 
nuts. 
Instead 
of 
continuing 
to 
herd 
cattle, 
the 
stockman 
stays 
with 
the 
horses. 
An 
hour 
passes 
and he’s gone. The 
campfire 
is 
still 
lit. The horse is still tied. A 
hundred kilometers south lies 
his body. Dead. No injuries, no 
water. According to the story, 
he was found the same day he 
disappeared.
In 
the 
stretches 
and 
stretches 
of 
hot, 
barren 
Australian land over a hundred 
years later, Jane Harper’s 
“The Lost Man” tells an eerily 
similar story. This time, it’s 
about three brothers: Nathan, 
the oldest, ostracized from the 
community and living three-
hours from the closest human; 
Bub, the baby of the family, 
separated by 12 years from 
his oldest brother and Cam, 
dead beneath their feet. Like 
the myth of the stockman, 
Cam had no injuries, no water 
and was found only nine 
kilometers from his truck.

Cam has breathed in the 
barren Australian outback air 
since birth. How did he die?
Nathan decides to return 
to 
his 
smaller-than-small 
hometown 
to 
investigate 
his brother’s death with his 
fifteen-year-old son in tow. 
As 
Nathan 
examines 
his 
own regrets and past — his 
relationship with his family 

and the pieces of his brother 
that were hidden in plain 
sight — he stumbles upon a 
disturbing string of family 
mysteries. “The Lost Man” 
never stagnates, the more 
that Nathan uncovers, the 
more it seems that the once 
inconsequential 
trivialities 
prove to wield deeper and 
darker implications. “The Lost 
Man” forces you to question 
parts of the story that you 
accepted unequivocally and, 
like Nathan, examine what’s 
true, what’s not and the 
blurred line between. 
Jane Harper’s style is sticky 
with the thick, Australian 
heat. The sparse sentences 
mirror the stretch and length 
of blank and vacant land. The 
weight of each page feels heavy 
as if the heat was palpable. As 

the tensions of the book rise, 
so does the temperature. Like 
Nathan sifting through more 
and more answers of Cam’s 
past, the reader must sift 
through tumbleweeds of red 
herrings. We’re parched for 
more details — more answers 
— and the book itself offers 
no reprieve. It’s not until the 
very last line that it feels like 
you 
can 
finally 
gulp mouthfuls of 
water. For a novel 
close to 400 pages, 
it’s easy to zoom 
through. 
With 
each page, there’s 
a nagging thought 
that 
something 
isn’t 
quite 
right. 
Was Cam’s death 
a murder, or was 
it 
suicide? 
Jane 
Harper 
artfully 
misdirects 
the 
readers so that by 
the very end, the 
twist is like a slap 
in the face. It’s easy to think: 
How could I have missed this?
As Nathan pieces together 
more clarity about Cam, the 
small-town 
becomes 
less 
stifling. It reflects Nathan’s 
trajectory 
from 
being 
a 
reticent and depressed man 
to a relaxed and receptive 
person. Instead of minimizing 
the mistakes of his past, 
Nathan is able to come to 
terms with his own life and 
mend rifts with his son.
“The Lost Man” is more than 
a mystery. It’s a story about 
family and the people that you 
think you know. By the end, 
you learn to appreciate how 
a family isolated in a blanket 
of nothingness manages to 
survive by holding onto their 
powerful thread of human 
connection.

Late run of goals displays Moyle’s ability to get to front of net

Until late December, Nolan 
Moyle had just two points — and 
neither were goals.
But on Dec. 30, the freshman 
forward found twine for the 
first time as a member of the 
Michigan hockey team. The 
switch didn’t flip immediately 
— Moyle added another goal 
two games later but it took him 
eight more games to get his 
third.
The next time Moyle lit the 
lamp, it was the first multi-goal 
game of his career with two 
tallies against Michigan State 
on Feb. 9.
Since 
then, 
he’s 
added 
another multi-goal outing and 
has at least one goal in three of 
the Wolverines’ last four games. 
Not bad for a freshman who 
didn’t have a goal until nearly 
the second half of the season.
“I saw (Moyle) last year score 
(in the USHL), and he has the 
potential,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson on Saturday night. 
“Sometimes it just takes a while 
until you feel comfortable with 

it. Good for him. We’re gonna 
need that.”
On Friday night against No. 
7 Ohio State, Moyle’s two goals 
came at crucial times for his 
team. One tied the game with 10 
minutes left in the third period, 
and the second was the game-
winner. But for Pearson, the 
location of those goals was even 
better than the timing.
Both goals came in what 
Pearson calls the gritty area 
of the ice — the space below 
the faceoff circles and above 
the crease, just in front of the 
opposing 
goaltender. 
When 
players get to that space, scoring 
opportunities increase because 
there’s 
always 
someone 
in 
position to clean up a rebound 
and create extra chances.
“I think that’s a real good 
reminder for our players to 
watch that and see where Nolan 
got his goals from,” Pearson 
said Tuesday. “One was behind 
him, but the other two was — 
he’s going to the front of the net. 
In this day and age, with teams 
playing so well defensively and 
having good goaltending, you’ve 
gotta get there.”

Moyle did just that on his 
first goal on Friday.
Freshman forward Garrett 
Van Wyhe pushed the puck 
up the right side of the ice and 
wrapped around behind the net. 
His shot bounced off goaltender 
Sean Romeo’s pad which sent 
the puck out to Moyle, who was 
crashing down on the crease. It 
didn’t take much for Moyle to 
tap the puck home and tie the 
game.
The puck once again came 
from Van Wyhe on the game-
winning goal. This time, his 
pass from the left side of the net 
went across the crease to Moyle, 
who was waiting to shoot the 
puck into the open right side.
“Garrett made two really 
good plays, really strong plays 
to the net,” Moyle said Tuesday. 
“I just happened to be in front 
and get a stick on it. Garrett and 
(sophomore 
forward 
Dakota 
Raabe) used their speed really 
well and did all the work and 
got the puck in front of the net.”
But as much as Moyle wants 
to deflect the credit, his goals 
were still largely the result 
of intelligent positioning and 

working to get to that area in 
front of the net.
After Friday’s win, Van Wyhe 
said that Moyle getting to the 
front of the net is something 
they’ve worked hard on in 
practice throughout the season. 
The two goals from that area 
on Friday cemented that their 
work is paying off.
The myriad of drills Pearson 
puts the Wolverines through 
every day in practice largely 
focus on getting to the top of the 
crease. With four of his seven 
goals on the season coming 
from that area, Moyle is clearly 
figuring out that the system 
works.
“We have a number of drills 

where the offense — and the 
main priority is to get to the 
net,” Pearson said. “We had to 
remind a few guys today that 
sort of get to an area and they 
stop skating and they’re still a 
long way (away from the net). 
We’re trying to attack the net 
more. A lot of different drills we 
do, especially with our forwards 
to get to a certain point on the 
ice and in front of the net. … Just 
a lot of different drills that are 
structured to that point. To get 
to the net and then hang around 
the net and finish.”
This 
weekend, 
Michigan 
goes to Wisconsin, where the 
Badgers play on an Olympic-
sized ice sheet. The ice is 15 

feet 
wider 
than 
traditional 
college or NHL rinks, which 
makes getting to the net more 
of a challenge. With so much 
extra space, it’s easy to stray 
away from the crease without 
realizing it and then have to 
work even harder to get back to 
the front of the net.
That could make Moyle’s 
knack to do so all the more 
important.
The 
Wolverines 
are 
one 
win away from hosting the 
first round of the Big Ten 
Tournament. And with five 
goals in the last four games, 
Moyle’s scoring ability may be 
what Michigan needs to get 
home-ice advantage.

Talent of freshman class 
apparent early in the season

As the ball crossed the middle 
of the plate and the Louisiana 
State pitcher, Shelbi Sunseri, 
swung and missed, right-hander 
Alex Storako’s changeup closed 
out the inning without any 
contact with the ball. 
Watching the pitcher throw 
four consecutive strikeouts last 
Sunday, with all the confidence 
of a veteran, you’d never guess 
Storako is one of the youngest 
players on the team.
From Storako to outfielder 
Lexie Blair to infielder Morgan 
Overaitis, the Michigan softball 
team’s (6-8) No. 14 per FloSoftball 
recruiting class features talent 
all over the field. And not all of 
the Wolverines’ freshmen have 
gotten the opportunity to show 
what they can do yet.
“We have a group of athletes,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins on Feb. 5. “They’re all 
very athletic. They’re all good 
softball 
players. 
Lexie 
Blair 
just walking in the door and 
is an outfielder and looks like 
she’s been on that outfield for 
her whole career. She makes 
everything look easy. She’s a heck 
of an athlete. You look at Morgan 
Overaitis and (infielder) Gianna 
Carosone: two good athletes who 
have just gotten better and better 
all year.”
Blair has not only proven 
herself in the outfield, but also 
as an asset in the batters’ box, 
boasting a batting average of 
.340, the second highest among 
the team’s starters. Blair’s power 
behind the plate has been a 
standout for a team that has 
struggled to get on base. Last 
Friday, Blair was responsible 
for three of six total hits for the 
Wolverines and has scored seven 
runs over the course of the season. 
“Lexie has stepped up huge,” 
said junior outfielder Madison 
Uden on Feb. 5. “She doesn’t look 

like a freshman to me. She looks 
great in the outfield and hits the 
ball well.”
Michigan 
boasts 
young 
defensive standouts as well. One 
year after left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien burst onto the scene as 
a freshman, Storako has emerged 
as a strong pitcher. Storako made 
her collegiate debut in the first 
game of the season. Since then, 
she has been vital to the rotation, 
pitching as many innings as 
Beaubien.
So far, the freshman has 
outperformed her mentor, giving 
up fewer runs and allowing fewer 
runners on base. She currently 
possesses an ERA of 2.50. 
Despite 
her 
impressive 
performance early on, Storako, 
like everyone on the team, has 
things to work on. For one, she 
has yet to pitch a full game, 
frequently being taken out after 
giving up several walks.
“Storako’s done a great job,” 
Hutchins said. “But we need her 
to sustain during the game and 
finish the game. You always do it 
one inning at a time.”
With many of their games 
being lost by one or two runs, the 
Wolverines have rarely been in a 
position to test out the fledgling 
players, leaving many freshmen 
with little-to-no time on the field. 
Among these players is catcher 

Hannah Carson, who has 10 at 
bats and stepped in for senior 
catcher Katie Alexander in two 
games.
“Hannah is an amazing player 
— she’s obviously been catching 
for a long time, and I see myself 
in her too,” Alexander said. “I’ve 
watched videos of myself hitting 
while she’s catching and I think, 
‘Am I catching? Is that me?’ She 
pays attention to detail, and I 
think that she’s going to do really 
well because she already has the 
physical stuff. Now it’s about the 
mental game and getting in there, 
getting reps and knowing the 
speed of the college game.”
The 
transition 
from 
high 
school to collegiate play can pose 
a problem for some athletes with 
stark increases in the levels of 
pitching and the sheer pace of the 
game.
The 
upperclassmen 
have 
stepped up to ease this transition, 
preparing the novice players to 
take the reigns someday. 
“They know they’re playing 
behind a veteran group and 
we’ve had some conversations,” 
Hutchins said on Feb. 5. “I just 
inspired them and you never 
know when you’re going to get 
your opportunity. You never 
know when you’re one pitch 
from being in the lineup to player 
forward every day.”

Weiss adjusting to life in spotlight

Freshman 
right-hander 
Willie Weiss was thrown into 
the fray in the second inning on 
Sunday against The Citadel. The 
Michigan baseball team turned 
to Weiss after the first inning 
struggles of redshirt junior 
pitcher Benjamin Keizer had put 
it down 2-0.
Three batters, eight pitches 
and three outs later, Weiss 
walked off the mound with the 
ship righted. The Wolverines 
never looked back.
Weiss 
calmly 
struck 
out 
the first batter swinging. The 
second struck out looking. The 
third was retired after a pop-
up to first base on the opening 
pitch.
The right hander was not 
fazed throughout his 2.2 innings, 
only his second regular season 
appearance for the Wolverines. 
Weiss got the first two batters 
he faced out in the third inning 
before he faced a mini-jam with 
runners on second and first 
after a single, wild pitch and a 
walk. Weiss escaped the inning 
unscathed after a line-drive out 

by Bulldogs junior infielder Ben 
Peden.
“When 
you 
have 
some 
hitters that are facing really 
good pitchers and pitchers that 
are facing really good hitters 
on your own team, then the 
learning curve can get sped up 
a little bit,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “And be improved 
once 
you 
get 
into 
outside 
competition.”
Weiss has made a name for 
himself as the only freshman to 
have an early season impact for 
the Wolverines.
He was named the Gatorade 
Player of the Year for baseball in 
the state of Oregon for the 2017-
18 high school season. Weiss 
was one of the most sought-after 
recruits in the nation and was 
a highlight of Michigan’s 2018 
recruiting class. He was ranked 
the 22nd right-handed pitcher 
by Perfect Game’s recruiting 
service.
Bakich was high on Weiss 
prior to the season.
“He’s a guy that — he’s a strong 
physical specimen. 6-foot-3, 220 
lbs., throws hard, has a good 
slider, a good breaking ball. He’s 
got a chance to be a starter or a 

closer for us. He’s really had a 
nice fall, a nice preseason, one 
of those freshmen that had a 
chance to make an impact no 
matter where he went.”
So far this season, he’s made 
that impact felt.
Weiss finished Sunday with 
no hits, no earned runs and 
four strikeouts after facing 10 
batters. He also was awarded 
the first win of his career.
Weiss showed resilience after 
easing into his first start in which 
he lasted a single inning against 
Binghamton on Feb. 16th. Weiss 
provided a steady hand on the 
road when the Wolverines were 
down a run, which allowed the 
offense to kick into gear.
“Now, it’s a long season and 
we got a long way to go, he’s got 
a long way to go,” Bakich said. 
“But, so far through the fall, 
through the preseason in the 
early goings of this season he 
certainly seems to have adjusted 
well and is pitching well. And 
that’ll be the challenge, like 
many of the freshmen before 
him, is to be able to be consistent 
and maintain that throughout 
the course of the next four 
months.”

Wolverines set to wave goodbye to senior class

On Sunday, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team will 
take on Wisconsin in its final 
game of the regular season, and 
Ann Arbor will say goodbye to 
one of the best senior classes in 
program history. 
While the four seniors have 
taken different paths to reach 
the climax of their respective 
collegiate careers, they will all 
be celebrated together. There’s 
graduate student guard Taylor 
Rooks, who in her one season 
at Michigan has become just as 
much a part of the team as anyone 
else. There’s senior forward 
Samantha Trammel, who coach 
Kim Barnes Arico views as one 
of the program’s leaders. And 
then there are the team captains, 
senior guard Nicole Munger and 
center Hallie Thome.
Munger — who is just 31 
points away from 1,000 career 
points — has started every game 
the last two seasons and has 
become the heart and soul of the 
Wolverines. Thome — 43 points 
shy of becoming the second 
most prolific scorer in program 
history — has started every game 
since she stepped on campus 
four years ago and has grown 
into the vocal leader of the team. 
The two, who are roommates 
and co-captains, have developed 
a close relationship during their 
time at Michigan.
“We see new things with each 
other and learn new things about 
each other, which is really special 
because some people plateau,” 
Munger said. “But we just really 
play off of each other, both in the 
locker room and on the court. 
She might be more vocal but 
I may be (more) reserved but 
lead by example. We just really 
complement each other both on 
the court and off the court.”
When Munger and Thome 

walk off the Crisler Center floor 
for the final time, the Wolverines 
will 
lose 
two 
of 
the 
players 
who 
helped 
establish 
the 
team’s 
attitude 
and identity this 
year. 
Even 
after 
starting 3-6 in the 
Big Ten season, 
and after Munger 
and Thome’s final 
season 
looked 
like it might be headed toward 
disappointment, 
the 
captains 
and the rest of the Wolverines 
never doubted their ability to 
recover.
Since then, Michigan has 
won seven of eight games and 
currently sits in fourth place in 
the Big Ten standings, largely 
on the backs of its two senior 
captains.
“I think they complement each 
other extremely, extremely well,” 
Barnes Arico said. “They’re very 
different, but they both want the 
same things and they have the 
same goals and they have the 
same dreams and aspirations. 
But they both go about it in a 
very different approach. And I 
think when you have leaders you 
need that.
“You don’t need people that 
are all the same. You need to 
be able to attack the group in 
different ways and I think that 
both Nicole and Hallie have 
that balance with each other as 
roommates and as teammates.”
But as Barnes Arico reminisces 
with Munger and Thome about 
their careers, the trio has not 
allowed 
themselves 
to 
get 
distracted from the fact that they 
have a basketball game to play — 
and an important one at that. 
Senior Day comes with the 
Wolverines in a fight for an 
NCAA Tournament berth and 
when every win matters. And 

even though Munger knows 
her career is dwindling, she’s 
not 
willing 
to 
get 
caught 
up 
in all the talk, 
and 
wants 
to, 
as usual, leave 
everything 
she 
has on the court. 
“I think people 
are realizing that 
kind of the end 
is near in a way, 
so 
just 
giving 
it all we have,” 
Munger said. “No one’s feeling 
a hundred percent at this point 
in the season on our team, or on 
any team in America, so it’s just 
a grind. It’s February, March and 
you just gotta have fun with it.”

Still, though, Senior Day is 
bound to be an emotional time. 
To 
send 
off 
players — who 
are 
sometimes 
even considered 
family 
— 
that 
have 
played 
with the same 
program 
and 
been 
with 
the 
same people for 
four years is a 
tough ask. 
And 
even 
though 
Barnes 
Arico has seen her fair share 
of seniors graduate and players 
come and go, that doesn’t make 
the end of an era any easier.
“It’s 
hard 
and 
sometimes 

I forget because it’s kind of 
what we do. And my children 
actually remind 
me because my 
own 
children 
are 
usually 
crying snots and 
tears 
because 
they 
have 
to 
say goodbye to 
them,” 
Barnes 
Arico said of past 
senior 
classes. 
“They have been 
such a large part, 
our senior class 
has been such a large part of 
my life, my children’s life, our 
Michigan life for four years. And 
to not see them every day leaves 
a little bit of a hole.” 

Now, as the season comes to 
an end, it’s time for the next step 
in the lives of each of Michigan’s 
four graduating players.
Where they may go and what 
they may do is yet to be seen. But, 
no matter what, Barnes Arico 
knows they are all prepared to 
move on.
“As I tell their parents when 
we recruit them here, they’re at 
a point in their lives where it’s 
time for them to fly and time for 
them to spread their wings and 
go off,” Barnes Arico said. “And 
as parents, you trust us as their 
coaches when you send them to 
Michigan and now it’s time for 
us to trust that they are ready 
as grown children to go and 
conquer the world.”

2018 NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS

Can Jordan Poole find consistency?

Jordan Poole’s eyes locked 
on the loose ball headed out of 
bounds. He grabbed it in the nick 
of time, took one dribble and 
pulled the trigger.
Bang.
A possession later, with 33 
seconds remaining, Poole cruised 
around a screen, looking up to 
see the hoop 26 feet away and 
Xavier Tillman much closer. The 
Michigan State forward threw 
out his arm, but Poole had already 
made up his mind. He let fly.
Bang.
This is what Michigan and its 
fans expect from Jordan Poole — 
a clutch, cold-blooded killer with 
no conscience and no limit to his 
range.
But the Wolverines lost to the 
Spartans, 77-70, on Sunday, and 
Poole’s desperation 3-pointers 
were merely shots in the dark, 
aimed at a target that had long 
since escaped. And Poole was a 
main reason that the target got 
away in the first place.
Michigan couldn’t adapt to 
Michigan 
State’s 
unexpected, 
screen-switching 
defense 
and 
was plagued by questionable shot 
selection. When it did get good 
looks down the stretch, it missed 
them. Those problems affected 
everyone, but they didn’t obscure 
one of Poole’s worst performances 
— before the final minute, he 
had just nine points on 3-for-
10 shooting with two assists, a 
rebound and four fouls.
Poole 
has 
never 
been 
a 
defensive keystone, but the lapses 
he suffered against the Spartans 
were uncharacteristic even for 
him. He struggled against Matt 
McQuaid on the perimeter, often 
leaping far past him with overly 
aggressive closeouts and giving 
one of the Big Ten’s best shooters 
wide-open looks.
Three 
minutes 
after 
the 
Wolverines took their largest 
lead of the game at 51-45, Poole 
flew recklessly into McQuaid as 
he was shooting and sent him to 
the line. Poole was benched and 
McQuaid knocked down all three 
free throws. Just over a minute 
later, the Spartans took the lead 

for good.
Michigan coach John Beilein 
has 
bemoaned 
his 
team’s 
tendency to spot up for 3-pointers 
far outside the arc instead of 
stepping into a more makeable 
distance. Poole is one of the most 
frequent offenders — while his 
range is usually an advantage, it 
also can turn into a crutch, as he 
will often force long shots when 
all else fails.
But no matter how good 
the look, Poole simply couldn’t 
find his stroke — before his late 
outburst, he missed all six of his 
treys.
“I would love to figure out why 
Jordan Poole can have the same 
shots and they don’t go in,” Beilein 
said on Feb. 21. “ … We just gotta 
continue to try to get good shots 
and obviously the better the shot, 
the more chance it’s gonna go in.”
While Michigan State’s screen-
switching, intended to create 
one-on-one scenarios, deserves 
its share of credit, one-on-one 
situations are not impossible 
to solve. As evidenced by Poole 
falling back on long 3-pointers, 
the Wolverines didn’t have the 
answer on Sunday.
“Our shot selection is better 
than what it was earlier in the 
year, but we gotta take good shots 
all the time,” Beilein said Sunday. 
“… We have certain habits that 
are not good for some one-on-one 
situations.”
A player can be effective 
without 
being 
consistent, 
consistent without being effective, 
both or neither. Poole tends to 
alternate between the first and 

the latter. This is borne out by, 
among other things, his 3-point 
percentages: 40.6 in November, 
58.3 in December, 26.2 in January 
and 32.0 so far this month.
It’s also on display from a game-
to-game basis. At Minnesota on 
Thursday, Poole nailed five threes 
and scored 22 points, his most 
of any Big Ten game, appearing 
to shake out of the doldrums of 
conference play.
“We know how good we are 
of a shooting team,” he said then. 
“Eventually they’re gonna fall like 
they did in the second half. We’re 
not really too worried, we go out 
there and just keep hooping.”
And therein lies the dilemma 
faced by Michigan. Poole has all 
the tools to be a go-to scorer for 
one of the nation’s elite teams. The 
Wolverines don’t have another 
player willing to take — and often 
hit — the same shots Poole puts 
up. On the flip side, though, his 
playing style and role as a tough-
shot maker inherently limit his 
consistency.
When those shots are finding 
the net, it’s an easy trade-off for 
Michigan. When they’re not, 
games like Sundays are often the 
result.
But 
what’s 
the 
difference 
between the Jordan Poole who 
torched Williams Arena and 
the Jordan Poole who has shot 
just 32 percent from downtown 
in conference play? The Jordan 
Poole of the first 39 minutes 
Sunday vs. the Jordan Poole of the 
final minute?
Right now, the Wolverines 
don’t know.

lockbuster, Borders, Brookstone, BlackBerry — 
one of these things is not like the others. What 
once was a household tech name is now a memory 
of the past. But while BlackBerry is no longer considered a 
competitor to moguls Apple and Samsung, it has moved on 
to a new audience: the automotive industry. 
Ten years ago, cell phone users nationwide were typing 
away on their mobile devices with a physical QWERTY 
keyboard. In fact, BlackBerry held roughly 20 percent of 
the smartphone operating system market share. It built its 
own operating system from scratch, and made the unique 
decision not to have it be open source — unlike that of 
Android, which briefly became a security nightmare. For 
this very reason, BlackBerry was picked up by businesses 
and governments worldwide. But despite its recent switch 
to an Android-based operating system, it prides itself on a 
value proposition of security — to the point of former Pres-
ident Barack Obama being permitted to use his BlackBerry 
throughout both his terms, and El Chapo’s reliance on the 
mobile device to conduct his high-stakes activities. 
But while blackberry jam reigns as a top-five preserves 
flavor in the U.S., BlackBerry is taking strides to preserve 
itself. Pick any lens, and it will show BlackBerry on an 
inverse hockey stick. Market share? Revenue? Shipments? 
All of the above reveal a steep decline. But while many 
write BlackBerry off as the next company to file for Chap-
ter 11 bankruptcy, CEO John Chen begs to differ.

After arriving far too late 
to the touchscreen party, the 
company marked its turn-
ing point in 2016 with an 
exit from making its own cell 
phones, now relying on Indo-
nesian partners for manu-
facturing the smaller mobile 
phone business segment. In 
2017, BlackBerry saw a $940 
million dollar windfall after 
winning a lawsuit against 
chip 
manufacturer 
Qual-
comm for overcharging on 
royalties. With this momen-
tum, 
BlackBerry 
followed 
behind IBM, Microsoft and 
others in pursuit of a critical 
pivot: from hardware to soft-
ware. The difference? Chen 
took BlackBerry’s superior 
positioning in security from 
its cellphone heyday, and saw 
an alluring opportunity in 
auto.
Thus was born BlackBerry 
Technology Solutions. With 
a dire need to innovate in 
high-margin and emerging 
business areas, BlackBerry 
created BTS, which is upheld by 3 main pillars: QNX licens-
ing, Radar asset tracking, and Jarvis code scanning. This 
all is to maintain its edge on cybersecurity, radar tracking, 
and the automotive industry in the race to driverless cars. 
But what does that really mean?
In 2010, BlackBerry acquired QNX Software Systems to 
improve its operating systems. QNX was implemented in 
the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet in 2011 and in the Black-
Berry 10 in 2013, and picked up by numerous car compa-
nies soon thereafter. In fact, in 2018, it was found that 125 
million vehicles now use QNX technology for car infotain-
ment, competing directly against Microsoft’s Windows 
Embedded Automotive.
But what exactly is car infotainment? Your radio, USB 
and phone connectivity, rear parking assistance, hands-
free Bluetooth capability, navigation system and fuel sen-
sors are all powered by car infotainment software. QNX 
is also being used to improve software for autonomous 
cars. It can handle complex code needed to help driver-
less cars absorb data, and help a car’s software prioritize 
functions based on its environment and decision-making. 
While QNX doesn’t get in front of many people through 
the BlackBerry cell phone, drivers of BMW, Ford, General 
Motors and other car companies use QNX without even 
knowing it. In fact, just over a year ago, Chen announced 
that BlackBerry software powers 60 percent of connected 
cars on the road today.

The second pillar of BTS is BlackBerry Radar, which 
provides real-time data for the trucking industry, with 
the ability to track assets and manage fleets through dash-
boards for management. Radar is one example of the firm’s 
greater “internet of things” mission to combine real-time 
data with everyday objects. Investors’ biggest concern? 
BlackBerry management has been concealing Radar’s rev-
enue performance for two quarters now.
BlackBerry Jarvis, the third prominent asset of BTS, 
was released just over a year ago to fortify self-driving car 
software in order to prevent hackers from finding soft-
ware vulnerabilities. Today, a majority of a car’s typical 
functions are controlled by software, from adaptive cruise 
control to anti-lock brakes, to the sensors that flash when 
you are near other cars. A hacker being able to manipulate 
these functions could mean the difference between safety 
and a major car accident. With dozens of industry players 
racing to achieve the first self-driving car, cybersecurity is 
on the mind for most automakers. As Chen envisioned, this 
is Jarvis’ sweet spot.
These components are the pillars of BTS, but it is impor-
tant to remember that there is more to BlackBerry than 
just BTS. In fact, the division is only the third largest reve-
nue driver of the firm. While BlackBerry’s company vision 
resides within BTS, there is significant room for improve-
ment from a financial standpoint. However, it is headed in 
the right direction. In the last fiscal quarter, Chen stated 
that BTS revenue grew 23 percent over the last year, and 
QNX is taking the lead on this growth.
While BTS is functioning proof of BlackBerry’s new 
vested interest in automotive cybersecurity, its recent 
acquisition of cybersecurity firm Cylance for $1.4 billion is 
perhaps the most compelling stage of its blueprint. While 
it is a pricey one, the acquisition is said to rapidly grow 
the QNX arm of BTS, and perhaps initiate a cybersecurity 
consulting division, which Cylance originally offered as a 
standalone entity.
Interestingly enough, the market did not react sig-
nificantly to the acquisition announcement three months 
ago. In fact, many Wall Street analysts’ price target for 
BlackBerry remained unchanged. Investors are evidently 
approaching BlackBerry’s transformation with caution, 
which is understandable considering the company’s rela-
tively horizontal share price movement, and slow-mov-
ing pivot from its cellphone-associated brand to the auto 
industry.
Just last Thursday, BlackBerry announced that it had 
officially completed the acquisition of Cylance. As with 
any acquisition of a large firm, it will take a sizable amount 
of time before investors get to see tangible results. Until 
then, BlackBerry’s Enterprise Software, licensing and its 
44,000 patents will take lead on keeping the company 
afloat.
While BlackBerry is by no means a company at the fore-
front of tech news today, it is far from having its epitaph 
written maybe because people don’t write their own epi-
taphs.

ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTINE JEGARL

I 

had a tough time in business school 
from the get-go. It was terrifying to 
walk into the Winter Garden for the 
first time and pass by juniors in suits passed 
out on couches or sobbing on the phone 
after an exam. The relief I felt to finally 
not be an undecided freshman quickly dis-
solved during my first weeks. Something 
about that building and the people in it put 
tremendous gut-wrenching, hopeless pres-
sure on me.
Mostly, I was terrified because I had 
never felt so incompetent. As soon as I 
entered the Ross School of Business, I felt 
light years behind. Everyone was throw-
ing around words like “beta” and “bonds” 
while I couldn’t tell you what a stock really 
was. I had spent the past year pining to get 
in, and now I wasn’t so sure I had made the 
right decision.
Somehow, during a time when I was 
questioning every life decision I’d ever 
made, I found my sure calling for film. It 
was a complete accident and one of those 
life happenings that makes you believe in 
destiny. I had been cautiously shadowing a 
friend at the Ross club fair when I decided 
to walk out of the event. It wasn’t a heroic 
choice, but more of an embarrassing dash 
because I was so overwhelmed by the term 
“alternative investments” and didn’t know 
what it meant to consult things. Instead, I 
applied as a producer to an student orga-
nization called Filmic Productions, got 
accepted, and fell in love with the creative 
world. I felt euphoric for the first time since 
the school year had started.
For a while, I felt like I was on the right 
path. I wanted to tell stories that capture 
the human experience through film. I 
want to make someone exit a movie theatre 
feeling a changed person, a better person. 
Accounting didn’t give me the incredible 
feeling that making something out of noth-
ing does. It’s so fulfilling to produce unique 
ideas and channel it into art that affects 
society and makes people feel understood. 
So I dove into this world and gained intern-
ships in media. I was proud of my black 
sheep status at Ross and was not going to 
succumb to traditional career paths. I had 
found my fate and I was going to keep mov-
ing forward.
Inside though, the pressure was still 
mounting. My decision to go rogue felt like 
I had swallowed poison. My parents and 
friends were extremely supportive, but 
at the end of the day, I felt like I was fall-
ing short. While everyone around me was 
waking up early to make networking calls, 
studying prep material for cases, running 
between corporate presentations, and fol-
lowing their 5-year career plans, I was sim-
ply enjoying things and it didn’t feel right. 
I, too, wanted to be exhausted and talking 
numbers. Corporate sounded fancy and 
felt like the pinnacle goal. I hadn’t actually 
gone to business school to have fun, had I? 

I’d joined for the recruiting rush, the power 
suits, the perfected presentation decks and 
the signing bonuses. Movies were what 
people watched to relax. I yearned to be 
part of the intensity.
I secretly recruited and got a finance 
internship at JPMorgan. It caused an 
uproar with my family and friends. They 
knew I was just trying to make a point. Now 
the point had been made and they wanted 
me to go back to where I belonged, but I 
couldn’t stop. I wanted to know what it’s 
like to be among the Wall Street veterans 
and early morning Upper West Side com-
muters. Films would always exist no mat-
ter what, and business school had taught 
me that the opportunity to be among the 
real stars — among highly successful cor-
porate moguls — would be gone in a glance. 
I had to grasp it immediately before it was 
too late.
You can already guess what a mistake 
that was.
I fell into the trap fed to me by the cul-
ture of business school on how to formu-
late the best career. It was exciting at first, 
wearing my freshly pressed suit, receiving 
my badge to enter 270 Park, and clicking 
my heels to the elevator that would take 
me to my new team. They gave me JPM-
organ emblazoned gifts, provided a desk 
with two (two!) desktops, and set me up for 
coffee chats. I got to wear my JPMorgan 
banker bag in the subway, talk about how 
great Equinox is, and get Sweetgreen with 
associates.
I was constantly reminded that I was at 
a top firm and lucky to be in a team where 
I would do work for Jamie Dimon himself. 
“We’re the best team on the street”, they 
repeated. So I filled my coffee cups and fin-
ished my Excel sheets. I printed the team 
agendas and researched the daily invest-
ment news. I stayed late just to stay late and 
I arrived early just to arrive early.
Then at my midpoint meeting, my man-
ager said I couldn’t listen to music at work. 
I wasn’t on a team where I ever communi-
cated with others, so this confused me, but 
I obliged. I sheepishly slid back to my desk 
and went back to my PowerPoint. That’s 
when it hit me — there was no brain activ-
ity going on.
When I wasn’t listening to the Hamilton 
soundtrack or the latest Director’s Guild 
podcast, my brain was completely dead. 
Without the distraction, the work I was 
doing at my desk was painfully mundane. 
The summer felt like solitary confinement. 
I sat at one seat for hours on end, doing 
mind-numbing work for the higher up who 
would be sending it to the next higher up, 
and so on until it got lost in the vortex of 
useless presentations and files.
The work wasn’t difficult but it was 
awfully boring, and that I couldn’t stand. 
I feared ending up like Jackie in the office 
behind me, who wore the same Louboutin 

heels every day and who seemed to find the 
most genuine satisfaction in being able to 
brag about her Columbia MBA. The sec-
onds dragged to minutes, hours and days 
until finally my 10 weeks at the bank were 
done and I knew I would never go back.
When you frame your life decisions with 
happiness as the ultimate goal, it’s hard to 
choose to do what makes you happy. In cur-
rent times, exhaustion is romanticized and 
risk must always be hedged. We’re told to 
suffer now and reap the benefits later after 
setting ourselves up for a prolific long-term 
career. Even my strategy professor once 
asked the class, “It’s time to get serious. 
What’s more important to you, your grades 
or your friends?”
I think that the best decisions aren’t made 
based off pure happiness, but what you con-
sider as the best form of payment for your 
work. For some people, money is the right 
currency. It’s what they may need or what 
they truly want, and that’s OK. I do hope 
these 25-year-olds find joy in $17 cocktails 
at rooftop bars and weekend trips to the 
Hamptons. For others, it’s monotony and 
structured organizations and tasks. I mean, 
hey, someone has to do the accounting.
My currency is time. I could feel my 
time left on earth declining with every 
piece of data entered in excel. I saw the 
world continue without me as I stared out 
the same window from which I couldn’t 
move because it was admirable to not 
leave your desk. Millions of people 
walked through those streets while I 
watched, wondering what their sto-
ries were. Sitting there, I realized my 
time was depleting and nothing I did 
impacted the people actually making 
their way through the New York City 
streets — actually living.
The film industry is notoriously 
difficult and demanding. It’s hor-
rifyingly low pay and also requires 
painfully long work days. It takes 
a lot of grit to move up. The work 
can be unstable and the culture 
can be miserable. In my previous 
media related internships, bosses 
screamed at me, threw things at 
me and berated me. If I wanted to 
be happy, I probably wouldn’t choose 
a career in film. If I were fragile or 
wanted work-life balance, I definitely 
would run the other way. But I choose 
to do it because I know that the time 
I put into it is valuable for working 
toward a larger, more fulfilling goal. 
The time I spend trying to connect 
with the world and the people liv-
ing in it through this creative medi-
um we call film is so rewarding and 
extraordinary to me.
When I turned my back on corporate, 
people thought I was so bold. I don’t think 
it’s that triumphant. My goal isn’t to be a 
wild card in society, but to be pursuing 

something that is so exciting, encourage 
and challenging that I want to invest my 
time and soul into it and do the best job. 
I don’t regret going to business school or 
any of the employment opportunities I’ve 
taken. In fact, I’ve learned that my per-
sonality is exactly in line with business 
school — high strung and a little neurotic, 
but insanely efficient, professional and 
obsessed with Google Calendar. At the end 
of the day, it’s up to you to decide what’s 
best for yourself — something this past 
summer as well as the past 3 years of busi-
ness school revealed for me.
When my best friend (whom I met at 
Ross, by the way) was angry with me for 
recruiting in traditional corporate paths, 
he slipped me a note during class that said:

Dear Meesh,
Please stop being dumb and wasting 
your time. Pursue your passion and ignore 
the noise.
Regards,
Nick

It was great advice and though I hadn’t 
taken it, I hope someone else will. I hope 
more people will start valuing their pre-
cious time. It’s the only thing we can even-
tually transform into the “happiness” we 
humans always seem to be searching for. 
It’s the only thing that we can never really 
get back.

What’s your currency?


I 

have a vivid memory of an 
old photograph — I am 5 
years old. I am in the park 
across the street from my house 
in my school uniform, clutching 
in my hands two Barbie dolls and 
laughing. Behind me, the metal 
playground stands tall and bar-
ren, too hot to the touch under the 
heat of the afternoon desert sun. 
On the ground are sparse patches 
of yellowing grass, as if someone 
tried to make it grow but realized 
any attempt to shield it from the 
drought would be futile.
A vibrant Ciudad Juárez, Mex-
ico surrounds me. Beyond the 
guard and gate that protect my 
neighborhood, there is a wide 
avenue that runs north to south. 
It abruptly turns left when it runs 
into the basin of “el Río Bravo,” or 
the Rio Grande, as if acknowledg-
ing it is not welcome on the other 
side. Despite the apparent rejec-
tion from the “gringos,” a bustling 
business district dwells on either 
side of the street. Everything from 
restaurants and bars to costume 
shops and hair salons can be found 
there. Old American school buses 
that have been painted over and 
now function as public transpor-
tation drive up and down carelessly, a phone 
number labeled as “quejas,” or complaints, 
always written on the back just in case. People 
honk their horns at the jugglers who practice 
their art standing at intersections in hopes of 
receiving a peso or two from drivers.
At night, the avenue lights up in color, with 
strobe lights and smoke machines functioning 
at maximum speed until the early hours of the 
day. Occasionally, sirens can be heard in the 
distance, rushing to the site of the next rob-
bery or homicide. Over 1 million people coexist 
around this avenue — some are up to no good, 
but most lay their heads on their pillows every 
night thinking about love, professional success 
or responsibilities.
The year is 2002. The average price of a USD 
is 9.67 MXN. Due to the implementation of 
NAFTA, there are 396 
factories, or “maqui-
ladoras,” operating in 
Juárez. 
The 
average 
“maquiladora” 
worker 
earns 6 to 8 USD per 
day. But they are find-
ing themselves unem-
ployed as factories gear 
up to leave the val-
ley and outsource to 
China. Due to the fac-
tory exodus, 200,000 
people are uninsured. 
The justice movement 
“Ni una más,” or “Not 
One More,” is formed in 
response to an increase 
in women’s killings, or 

“femicidios.” The mayoral election has been 
canceled due to fraud allegations.
I have a vivid memory of an old photograph, 
my mother standing behind the camera, cap-
turing a perfectly uncomplicated moment in 
my life. My laughter echoes innocently up the 
avenue and into my neighbor’s houses, spilling 
onto the canvas of a complicated society, one 
forcibly delineated by what once was a flowing 
river, but is now an empty basin. Once the sound 
reaches the riverbed, it dips but then rises again 
and crosses freely onto the other side.
That freedom, the privilege, to laugh so sin-
cerely and without preoccupation would soon 
be muffled by expectations. From a very young 
age, I was accused of curiosity. I was a “calle-
jera,” or a girl who liked being out of the house, 
and a “jacalotes,” or a girl who always wanted 
to have fun. My curiosity was met with the 
realization that the more I learned about my 
society, the more I would be pushed to obey its 
rules. Close your legs when you sit. Smile at com-
pliments from old men. Feel good when they say 
you look like a butterfly. Don’t object when their 
eyes follow you as you walk away.
E

ight years later, the candor of my laugh-
ter has been replaced by a feigned, 
frustrated smile. Another memory of 
a photograph, except in this one I am 13 years 
old. I am surrounded by friends in the basket-
ball courts of our “secu,” or secondary school. 
We just performed in our school’s “fonoshow,” 
the Mexican equivalent to an American school’s 
talent show. This year, we banded together with 
a group of 9th grade students to choreograph 
a medley of songs. In the picture, a group of 
nine girls and two boys takes center stage. All 
of the girls, bare shouldered and wearing fish-
net tights, don red lipstick and rehearsed smiles 
while the boys stand there with their hands by 
their sides and straight faces.
I am kneeling on the ground. My hair, made 
to look unnaturally big, shines a golden brown, 
sun-kissed color that contrasts with my fair, 
makeup-covered skin. The outfit makes me 
look at least 15. My black shirt displays two 
spray painted golden hands over my breasts, 
and a white bra strap peeks out from under one 
of the shirt’s black spaghetti straps. My hand 
is uncomfortably patting my black tulle skirt 
down, as if its length made me uncomfortable.
Some of the other girls also place their hands 
in strategic places. One covers her chest while 
pretending to touch her collarbone. Another 
crosses her arms around her waist, hiding her 
midriff from the camera. Some hide behind oth-
ers, and some try to make themselves bigger. We 
are all dressed the same, but each of us wears 
the makeup and clothes differently.
Our school now runs drills in case of shoot-
ings, and the man who used to sell us popsi-
cles from the other side of the fence has been 
banned. Security has been tightened –– parents 
now have to carry photo IDs of their kids to be 
able to enter the school grounds. Kids go miss-
ing for weeks — we are told they went on vaca-
tion, but rumors fly around that they crossed the 
border for safety. Their parents have been kid-
napped. Their uncle was killed. Their brother 
was caught by “sicarios,” or hitmen, surrounded 

by the wrong company. 
Beyond us, the sunset, and the imminent 
darkness that is to follow it, dissolves plans and 
causes families to lock their doors and draw 
their curtains. The avenue stretches wider now 
than it did in 2002, but there are no cars to fill it. 
Once in a while, a lonely driver appears on the 
horizon and finds themselves waiting at a red 
light in vain. There are no cars driving on the 
cross street. What was once a bustling business 
district is now plagued by boarded storefronts 
and broken windows. In some places, bullet 
holes can be seen puncturing old store signs and 
doors of businesses that are still open to cus-
tomers –– there isn’t enough money to patch up 
or replace them.
Park benches and pavilions don’t serve their 
purpose anymore. They just tolerate the sun 
every day, their paint chipping and being eaten 
away by the radiation. The patches of grass that 
once existed in the 
park across the street 
from my house have 
long been forgotten, 
and now a layer of 
dust accumulates on 
our neighborhoods’ 
cars every time boys 
come out to play 
“fútbol.” Fences go 
up to block streets 
that once could be 
traveled freely, and 
cameras are installed 
at restaurants and 
stores.
On the north end of the avenue, the “gringos” 
have built an iron fence on the ancient basin of 
the “Río Bravo.” At night, Border Patrol SUVs 
station themselves at intervals to guard it. It is 
as if they have grown more scared and proud 
with the passing of time, each year broadening 
the chasm between self and other within which 
Border Patrol officers find comfort.
The year is 2010. The average price of 1 USD 
is 12.75 MXN. At least 3,000 deaths have been 
reported in Juárez, out of which 306 were 
femicides. Living in the metropolitan area are 
1,332,131 people, making the city the eighth larg-
est in Mexico. The Sinaloa Cartel and Juárez 
Cartels are fighting a “turf war.” During some 
months, Juárez reportedly experiences 10 mur-
ders a day. Some consider our city a war zone, 
so much so that the Mexican government has 
sent us military forces. Military checkpoints 
are common, but even more common yet is to 
see soldiers with their hands on the trigger of 
automatic weapons.
I am kneeling on the ground, and the inno-
cent laughter that seemed so normal in 2002 
has now vanished. Instead, I look uncomfort-
able. My smile appears wide, but my eyes say 
something else. The moment the camera man-
aged to capture is no longer uncomplicated. 
The laughter that once spilled unpreoccupied is 
now contained in a forced smile, kept at bay by 
the knowledge and the expectations that have 
accumulated with time. It is charged with years 
of bearing witness, years of seeing, feeling and 
hearing things that will never be forgotten.

The avenue and the river basin, as empty and 
broken as they may seem, are still my only land-
marks. At 13, I am actively discovering my body 
and identity, but I can only build up from what 
I already know. I know women are never sup-
posed to sit with their legs open. I know I am 
never supposed to admit that I wear makeup. 
Instead, I need to apply the perfect amount, 
enough to enhance my features but still go 
unnoticed by other people. I know my friends 
are embarrassed to eat in front of men for fear 
that they will be perceived as fat or without 
manners. I know I always need to smell good 
and smile quietly in the background of a con-
versation. I know I am never supposed to go the 
bathroom alone. I know I should feel flattered 
when a man tells me I am beautiful, even if it is 
at the wrong place in the wrong time.
Even if I never wanted to hear it or do it in the 
first place.
I feel uncom-
fortable in my 
own body. Vio-
lence finds a 
way to circle 
around it like a 
vulture patient-
ly waiting for its 
prey to die.
Violence 
circles my body 
in the “literal” 
way –– I always 
have 
to 
look 
back and make 
sure that a man 
is not following me when I am in the store with-
out my mother. I look back the same way that I 
always do when my father is driving past dawn, 
making sure no car follows us home, out of fear 
of being physically harmed.
There is a park near my house. It used to be 
an empty lot, but the government found a way 
to transform one of the corners into a memorial 
for the victims of femicide. Its walls are painted 
white with bright pink trims and the ground is 
littered with black and pink wooden crosses. 
In 2002, the sight of such bright colored walls 
and the presence of the crosses would spark me 
to ask questions that my mother never wanted 
to answer, but now I keep quiet. I know why 
the park is there now. I know what the crosses 
stand for. I understand what it means, and I 
have no reason to believe that I am exempt from 
that treatment.
A

nother 8 years have passed since I 
knelt on the basketball courts of my 
“secu,” and yet another photograph 
has been taken. For this one, I am able to recall 
the exact moment when it happened. It was 
a humid summer day in Mexico City, and my 
family was visiting La Casa Azul, Frida Kahlo’s 
childhood home converted into a museum of 
her art. My cousin motioned me to pose for a 
picture, and I reluctantly agreed. It was a pain-
less, fast moment. She kneeled, took the photo 
and stood up. I never imagined she would pro-
vide me with one of my favorite photographs of 
myself.
My smile is secure, confident, and I am look-

ing directly at the camera. I am wearing my 
favorite summer dress. Its cream color makes 
my skin appear sun-kissed, and the pattern 
melts into the background, as if Frida and I 
agreed to match our taste. The dress itself is 
heavy, made out of rayon, but it doesn’t seem to 
be bringing me down. My hands sit delicately on 
my sides, shoulders are relaxed, and I am lean-
ing back slightly as if motioning to the sky.
In the background, barely there, is the win-
dow of Frida’s studio. Her garden blossoms 
around me, and the little sun that can escape 
the canopy of trees creates shadows that dance 
on my face. The photo was taken from below, so 
it appears as if I am towering over the frame. 
Despite the exotic plants and colorful flowers 
and walls of the background, I am still the point 
of focus of the photograph. Every angle and line 
leads the eye to my face.
Out of the frame and surrounding me is a 
city that I barely know and a country that I no 
longer recognize. No sabes nada de la Ciudad de 
México, muchos se van y terminan regresando a 
sus pueblos asustados. You don’t know anything 
about Mexico City, many go and go back to their 
towns scared. That is what my grandma kept 
saying to me when I told her I wanted to move 
there.
The country, I don’t recognize because I left 
it. I have been living in the U.S. since 2011 and 
I now understand so much more. I am able to 
build my identity not only on the things that I 
see and experience, but also based on other 
people who are different than me but have some 
shared experiences.
The year is 2018. I have not lived in Juárez 
since I was 13 and I am now 20. The years have 
flown by without hesitation, and the girl in the 
photograph has learned how to reclaim herself. 
I still look back in the supermarket to see if any 
man is following me, but have stopped trying to 
determine if the person driving behind me has 
malicious intentions. I no longer shave my legs, 
now eat in front of men and always go to the 
bathroom by myself.
Most importantly, I have found my voice. 
I never knew it was possible to advocate for 
myself the way I have learned to do since 2011. 
It is in the small things. The girl with golden 
hands over her breasts, red lips and unnecessar-
ily big hair is now a part of a different, slightly 
more accepting society.
I now know my voice deserves to be heard. 
I know that violence and fear may have pre-
vented me from speaking before, but I am also 
aware that what I accepted as normal then 
would never pass as normal now. I am able to 
see everything that happened to me in Juárez 
as an outsider. I learn about my hometown from 
books and classes, from people who have never 
been there before. Their approach, the way they 
see my city may not be holistic, but I do think 
that it is valuable to study your experiences 
through an outsider’s role.
If it wasn’t for the University of Michigan, 
I would have not had the amount of education 
needed to process and deal with the remaining 
trauma left over from those last few years in 
Juárez.

A

nn Arbor: liberal heart of the 
Midwest, is the place I call 
home. A beloved college town in 
which things like a deer cull can monopo-
lize months of public debate. Ann Arbor, 
although filled to the brim with small 
town charm and regularly honored with 
numerous seemingly arbitrary accolades, 
is not a city without its fair share of prob-
lems. In particular, like many cities in 
modern America, Ann Arbor is plagued by 
an inequality gap.
This gap was something that I grew 
up in and around, implicitly aware of 
throughout my childhood, and explic-
itly disturbed by as I entered high school. 
Unfortunately, however, Ann Arbor’s 
problems are far too often ignored — 
swept under the rug by a unique form of 
Ann Arbor elitism that uses extreme out-
ward social liberalism to cover the reality 
of racial and economic homogeneity that 
is increasingly prevalent in this town.
My first experiences with this side of 
Ann Arbor culture began in elementary 
school. Bryant Elementary is located in 
one of the few low income neighborhoods 
in Ann Arbor, surrounded by multiple 
public housing projects and large, low-
income apartment buildings. The school 
welcomes a diverse student body, both 
racially and ethnically, among which a 
large percentage receive free or reduced 
lunch. My dad would often say that when 
he attended our school concerts, he felt as 
if he was sitting in a meeting of the United 
Nations.

My neighborhood was not originally 
included in the Bryant school zone, but 
it was added as a result of a citywide 
redistricting effort to bring about socio-
economic diversity. However, among the 
10 or so children that lived on my block, 
my brother, my cousin and I were the 
only ones to attend public school. Instead, 
many of our neighbors, fearful of the 
behavioral issues and other distractions 
that their children may have encountered 
at Bryant, choose to send their children to 
a $20,000 a year private school at which 
they would be surrounded by classmates 
who, socioeconomically, looked just like 
them.
Reminiscent of the racial homogeneity 
used to protect the cultural integrity of 
white neighborhoods in postwar Detroit, 
my neighbors, though a diverse group of 
individuals, leveraged economic barriers 
to essentially achieve the same goal: pro-
duce an artificially created “safe” space, 
sheltered from change and the reality of 
the diverse outside world.
 This attitude, however, is entirely para-
doxical when considering my neighbors’ 
political affiliations and apparent core 
belief system. Though my neighbors, like 
many Ann Arborites, bleed blue on the 
outside, speak of how they cherish diversi-
ty and inclusion, and mourn the tragedies 
surrounding the demise of public educa-
tion, their ideologies seem to be entirely 
lost in implementation. When given the 
opportunity to immerse their children 
in a diverse environment, like Bryant 

school, they veered in 
the opposite direction. 
This perplexing confla-
tion of values is some-
thing that I perceive 
to be representative of 
the greater Ann Arbor 
community: Social lib-
eralism is celebrated 
from a distance, but 
hardly 
practiced 
up 
close.
I wish I could say 
things got better when 
I reached high school, 
but unfortunately, the 
inequity that I wit-
nessed in education 
frankly got worse. The 
diverse group of stu-
dents that sat beside 
me 
all 
throughout 
elementary 
school 
seemed to disappear, 
especially as I tran-
sitioned 
into 
taking 
self-selecting advanced 
classes. I soon noticed 
that my classes felt less like a U.N. meet-
ing and increasingly more like a Senate 
Republican conference (though of course 
very different in political leanings.)
This extreme racial homogeneity of 
advanced classes seemed to create a 
restrictive tradition for success at my 
school, a tradition that mandates white-
ness as a prerequisite for admittance 
to the school’s high-achieving culture. 
When students fall behind — a trend that 
often occurs along racial lines — they are 
isolated from the opportunities of aca-
demic success that have come to define my 
school statewide.
I didn’t have to look far to find evidence 
of this achievement gap. Photos hung 
in the entrance hall of my high school 
depicting great, (predominantly) white 
alumni. The idea of college for many of 
my classmates was an expectation, not an 
achievement. And when 87 students from 
my graduating class decided to attend the 
University of Michigan, almost none of 
them were African American.
My journey in public education contin-
ues at the University of Michigan. Here, I 
have gained a new perspective of life in the 
city, realizing that the Ann Arbor I grew 
up in and the Ann Arbor that I experience 
as a University student are remarkably 
different. Using the model of gentrifica-
tion, it is almost as if the wealthy Universi-
ty students are a type of gentry, bringing a 
wave of investment that is in turn shaping 
and changing the culture of the city. Can-
ada Goose jackets have replaced Birken-

stocks as the fashion piece of choice for 
people I encounter around town, Range 
Rover SUVs are beginning to threaten the 
hordes of Subarus in the parking lots, and 
New York City-priced apartments in high 
rises sprung up around town. 
The culmination of these outward eco-
nomic status symbols create a restrictive 
culture that uses high prices to maintain 
an exclusive and homogeneous commu-
nity. As the high visibility of this elite 
class culture spreads across campus, stu-
dents who can’t produce a certain look or 
lead a certain lifestyle are being excluded 
economically, socially and psychologically 
from what seems to be the dominant cul-
ture of the University community.
This cultural evolution strays far from 
the University’s founding value of provid-
ing a quality education for the common 
man, a place where you could get an East 
Coast education without belonging to 
the East Coast elite. However, trends at 
Michigan in both the high average income 
of the student body, and high prices of 
tuition and livingindicate the opposite. 
Though the University has taken active 
efforts to attract low income students to 
its doors, this public institution no longer 
appears to be a place for the common man. 
To be common at the University of Michi-
gan is not to be from the 50 percent, but 
to be from a family who makes $154,000 
or more a year — in other words, belong to 
the privileged elite.
Given the many changes to the city of 
Ann Arbor in recent years, both physically 
and demographically, the future of the 
city is unknown. However, what is certain 
is that if the city follows the trend of build-
ing an ever growing economic border 
around its limits, the inequality gap and 
its effect on city culture will continue to 
grow. Who Ann Arbor is really for is now 
the dominant question. Is it for the people 
who live here currently? The people who 
will be able to afford the increasingly 
high price of cost of living in the future? 
Or is it for the cultivation of a diverse and 
multi-dimensional community that Ann 
Arbor voters demand, yet take no steps to 
enforce?
Ann Arbor is in the midst of an identity 
crisis — we preach one set of ideals yet 
practice another. We know who Ann Arbor 
was in the past, but until residents and the 
University decide to act on their beliefs 
and take control of who they want to the 
city to be and belong to in the future, the 
fate of the city is left to the trends of eco-
nomic development. Until Ann Arbor can 
find a way to bridge the divide between 
theory and practice, the future of the city 
may be out of our hands.

y typical Ann Arbor week-
end: I’ve made the trek down 
to Main Street to one of my 
favorite coffee shops and, before I get 
started on schoolwork, I sit with a fresh 
mug of black coffee and a crisp copy of 
the newspaper. That’s right: the news, on 
paper. Hard-copy news is still alive and 
well.
I joined The Michigan Daily on a whim 
when a friend ardently convinced me, 
and one year later, here I am in the posi-
tion of senior copy editor. As part of the 
copy section at The Daily, I now spend 
each week fact-checking and editing 
the grammar of articles. Looking back, 
I realize I joined not for the enthusiasm 
of editing or even the chance to belong to 
The Daily community, but out of a sub-
conscious passion for preserving the art 
of printed news — no app, email or Twit-
terverse sound-bitten form of news.
Today, society innovatively manages to 
stay informed and connected. However, 
it’s rare to see college students and mil-
lennials picking up and reading a physi-
cal newspaper like my grandparents do 
every morning at the breakfast table. For 
me, newspapers are the last true bastion 
of reliable information in an age of ques-
tionable online sources. As a copy editor, 
I understand the pertinence of not only 
grammatical editing but the absolute 
necessity of fact-checking for accurate 
information.
Ironically, I’m writing this article to 
an intended audience of college students 
and millennials who probably won’t 
actually read it. I’m sending a message in 
a bottle into the ocean hoping someone 
will eventually find it buried in the sand 
on a distant shore. This metaphor might 
be extreme, but you get the message (pun 
intended).
Most students, myself included, mind-
lessly scroll through their phones the 
way apps have trained us to do. A print 
newspaper forces us to stop and smell 
the roses. It distracts us in a wholesome 
way and forces us to reflect — even for 
just a minute of our day — on what else 
is going on in the world, without see-
ing these events through the unfocused 
lenses of social media sources. Though 
not impossible, it’s difficult to quickly 
and frantically skim the printed news in 
a rush to class or while walking through 
the crowds of State Street. A newspaper 
demands our full attention — a concept 
most of us reserve for binge-watching 
“Friends.”

A newspaper says more than the words 
on its pages. The voice of established pub-
lications such as The New York Times, 
The Washington Post and The Chicago 
Tribune all have specific styles that 
effectively reveal the inner truths of a 
location and subculture. The newspaper 
inherently conveys emotion and mood 
and has a personal effect on the reader. 
When touring colleges as a senior in high 
school, I always picked up the colleges’ 
student newspapers to assess the campus 
vibe and to understand the voice of its 
students.
Not surprisingly, one of my favor-
ite parts of my day during my summer 
internship experience in Washington, 
D.C., was reading Express, a free daily 
publication from The Washington Post, 
on the Metro every morning. It served 
not only as a source for the current state 
of the union and political shenanigans, 
but also became my personal guide to 

the city. The “Weekend Pass” section 
highlighted destinations of interest, local 
events, upcoming concerts and the new-
est museum exhibits in a way no website 
or friend recommendation could do. I 
found myself ending up everywhere from 
the steps of the National Portrait Gallery 
for the free Fall Out Boy concert before 
the Capitals’ playoff game to the Hirsh-
horn Museum for the Georg Baselitz 
exhibit ¬¬¬— all of this as a result of read-
ing the news.
If the news is so subtly transformative 
in our daily lives, then being involved 
with The Daily as copy editor is all the 
more transformative to my own life. 
While working at The Daily (and in an 
effort to keep current for my political 
science classes), I have refined my news-
reading habits and become inspired to 
declare an English major with a political 
science minor. Being involved so closely 
with the news introduced me to my own 

curiosity and excitement for reading that 
transcends the confines of the classroom 
and the realm of academia. I came to 
appreciate a news article as an art form, 
much like that of great literature, poetry 
or lyrics.
Though not truly an aging dinosaur 
yet, newspapers just might have a come-
back in our generation, much in the same 
way vinyl record players and Polaroid 
pictures have cluttered the dorm rooms 
of college students. I can only hope.
So as I finish my coffee shop session of 
weekend studying, I will leave behind my 
paged-through copy of The Daily with 
the intention that someone else might 
pick it up, take the time to read it, then 
leave it for the next person. Either that or 
it will end up on the bottom of their new 
puppy’s training cage. Regardless, I will 
continue to do my best to initiate a new 
reader — even if it’s just one hard copy at 
a time.
