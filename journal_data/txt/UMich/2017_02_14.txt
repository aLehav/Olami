The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
met with University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel and 
the Provost and Executive Vice 
President for Academic Affairs 
Search 
Advisory 
Committee 

Monday afternoon to discuss the 
selection of the new provost. 

Schlissel began the meeting 

by seeking input from SACUA on 
what the search committee should 
look for in a new provost. Schlissel 
welcomed SACUA’s advice not 
only on what qualifications the 
candidates should have, but also 
the issues to which they should be 
paying extra attention, particularly 
as a body that frequently interacts 
with the provost.

“I thought it would be valuable 

to have input from SACUA about 
what we should be paying closest 
attention to as we search for a 
new 
provost,” 
Schlissel 
said. 

“You’re amongst the group that 
interacts with the provost quite a 
bit … so your advice is particularly 
welcome.”

SACUA member John Lehman, 

a professor of biology, began the 
conversation by reading a list of 
questions he and the Academic 
Affairs 
Advisory 
Committee 

created. The committee hopes 
the questions will be used in the 
interviews of the candidates for 
provost. Its questions covered a 
broad range of topics, including 
what the candidate believes to be 
the purpose of the University and 

his or her vision for research and 
innovation at the University.

Lehman also stressed the 

importance of the future provost’s 
engagement with undergraduate 
education, 
considering 
the 

provost is currently the only 
individual with a responsibility 
for 
undergraduate 
education 

on campus. Lehman suggested 
asking whether the provost would 
like to expand that responsibility 
and if he or she would consider 

active 
involvement 
with 

students by teaching occasional 
undergraduate courses.

Schlissel 
responded 

enthusiastically to the AAAC’s list, 
saying the search committee has 
already spent time thinking about 
the provost’s relationship with 
undergraduate education.

“We were just talking about the 

issue of undergraduate education 
today,” Schlissel said. “All schools 
and colleges have structures that 

look after their undergraduate 
programs and deans respond 
on the school level. But the 
provost is really the integrator 
of undergraduate commitments 
across the campus.”

Other 
SACUA 
members 

posed 
their 
own 
questions 

regarding topics such as how 
the next provost will further the 
University’s Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan and interact with 

With 
the 
current 

administration nearing its end, the 
first campaign for the University 
of Michigan’s Central Student 
Government launched Monday 
night. The group celebrated its 
new beginning in the Ross School 
of Business with its 15 member 
team.

The party, eMerge, is headed 

by LSA junior Anushka Sarkar, 
the former Chief Programming 
Officer, 
who 
is 
running 
for 

President, 
and 
Public 
Policy 

junior Nadine Jawad, the current

Last

Sarkar 
worked 

with the Mental Health Leaders 
Network, where she helped push to

in Counseling and Psychological

based in pushing for sustainable 
changes that can impact a greater 
movement.

Updates regarding three hate 

crimes that occurred at the end of 
last year have been released by the 
Ann Arbor Police Department. 
Following the conclusion of a 
joint investigation with the FBI, 
AAPD and the Division of Public 
Safety and Security, two of the 
three crimes were deemed as 
being falsely reported and the 
other investigation is currently 
inactive because of lack of 
information.

The 
first 
incident, 
which 

took place on Nov. 11, involved 
a student who reported being 
approached by a man who 
demanded she remove her hijab 
or he would set her on fire. It 
was later determined, citing 
several discrepancies between 
eyewitness 
testimonies 
and 

surveillance 
tapes 
from 
the 

scene, the alleged crime did 
not occur. According to a press 
release from the AAPD, the 
student will not be prosecuted 
for the false report.

The Provost and Executive 

Vice President for Academic 
Affairs 
Search 
Advisory 

Committee held a town hall 
meeting Monday evening, seeking 
public input on the search process 
for the position, which oversees 
academic and budgetary affairs 
for the University of Michigan.

The position of interim provost 

is currently held by Public Policy 
Prof. Paul Courant, who assumed 
the position on Feb. 1st after 
former Provost Martha Pollack 
left the University on Jan. 31 to 
serve role as president of Cornell 
University starting April 17.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
who 
chairs 
the 

committee, said he hopes to fill 
the position by the beginning of 
the next academic year.

Aside 
from 
Schlissel, 
the 

committee 
consists 
of 
10 

professors and deans from several 
of the University’s 19 schools, as 
well as one student representative.

The 
town 
hall 
had 
an 

attendance of about 30 people, 
most of whom were faculty and 
staff, as well as the committee 
members themselves. The group 
articulated ideas about what 
qualities the next provost should 
have and the issues with which he 
or she should be most concerned.

Several attendees mentioned 

the importance of the provost’s 
understanding 
of 
research, 

including 
Vice 
President 
for 

Research Jack Hu, a committee 
member 
and 
professor 
of 

mechanical 
engineering, 
who 

said it was important to him that 
the future provost was someone 
who had done research and 
understood the complexities of 
the research enterprise.

LSA senior Aditi Rao raised 

the question of innovations in 
education, citing Caitlin Holman’s 
recent TedxUofM presentation 
about improvements that could be 
made in education.

“I know a few of you have 

mentioned the importance of 
research and that the provost 
has participated in research,” 
Rao said. “I think it would be

University as a public institution has strict policies regarding First Amendment

In the last year there have been 

several instances of hate speech 
and 
targeted 
verbal 
attacks 

against different minority groups 
on the University of Michigan 
campus. 
However, 
the 
line 

between hate speech and free 
speech remains blurred for the 
University to interpret in each 
individual case, as the balance 
between maintaining free speech 
and a safe environment for 

students continually remains a 
precarious one.

As a public institution, the 

University must strictly adhere 
to the First Amendment and the 
freedom of speech it guarantees. 
The 
University 
codified 
its 

commitment 
to 
free 
speech 

and a safe campus in its UM 
Standard Practice Guide, as of 
the many policies in the SPG, one 
is dedicated solely to 601.01, the 
“Freedom of Speech and Artistic 
Expression.”

The Civil Liberties Board of 

the University’s Senate Assembly 

proposed a set of guidelines to be 
adopted by the University.

Prefacing the policies is the 

goal that, by representing and 
allowing for the entire spectrum 
of opinions within the University 
community, the staff can create 
an 
open 
forum 
for 
diverse 

opinions. The guidelines of 601.01 
are committed to the exchange of 
opinions to encourage learning.

“Expression of diverse points of 

view is of the highest importance, 
not only for those who espouse a 
cause or position and then defend 
it, but also for those who hear and 

pass judgment on that defense,” 
the policy reads. “The belief that 
an opinion is pernicious, false, or 
in any other way detestable cannot 
be grounds for its suppression.”

Law student Erin Pamukcu, 

president 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter 
of 
the 
American 

Constitution 
Society, 
believes 

the First Amendment and free 
speech are foundations not only 
in the study of law, but the U.S. 
democratic system.

“It’s 
the 
Amendment 
that 

ensures the will of the people can

2 — Tuesday, February 14, 2017

LSA senior David Schafer, 

Central 
Student 
Government 

president, vetoed the Israeli-
Palestinian 
lunch 
resolution, 

which sparked a heated debate 
within the student government, 
Monday afternoon.

The proposed lunches, which 

were meant to foster dialogue 
between the body and Israeli and 
Palestinian students on campus, 
passed last meeting with 18 votes 
in favor, nine opposed and five 
abstentions.

In his statement, Schafer wrote 

he did not believe CSG should 
impose itself and widen its scope 
within the global-issue conflict.

“The overarching purpose of our 

organization is to address pressing 
student issues and concerns that 
have a direct and unambiguous 

connection to campus, such as 
mental health, sexual assault 
prevention, sustainability, and the 
rights of undocumented students,” 
he wrote. “We are best served, and 
our resources are most efficiently 
utilized, when we are faithful to 
this mission.” 

Another reason the bill was 

met with disagreement from 
the executive board was the 
concern that Student Allied for 
Freedom and Equality, the pro-
Palestinian student organization 
on campus, was not also a sponsor 
of the resolution. Schafer said 
the assembly “flippantly” did not 
take the absence of SAFE into 
consideration.

“As the student government that 

seeks to represent every Michigan 
student, our most important job 
is fostering an inclusive culture, 
both within and outside of CSG,” 
he wrote. “By advancing this 
Resolution without weighing the 

concerns of students in SAFE or 
any other student who might take 
issue with this Resolution, we are 
neglecting this foundational goal. 
While I do very much appreciate 
the author’s good faith attempts 
to gain support from a diverse 
cross-section of students, this 
conspicuous absence of support is 
enough reason for me to veto this 
Resolution.”

CSG Vice President Micah 

Griggs, LSA senior, also touched 
upon this in the last Assembly 
meeting, stating she did not feel 
comfortable the proposed lunches 
were not open to the public. The 
resolution asked for a selected 
group of people who had to take a 
survey in order to be admitted into 
the lunches.

“It doesn’t maximize the 

student body reach, it’s not 
accessible to other students, 
it’s exclusive,” Griggs said last 
Tuesday night. “I think the 

reason that there aren’t any 
sponsors is because of the 
bigger problems of this issue 
… If you want real allies in 
this conversation and it’s 
not one-sided or just two-
sided then invite members 
like 
(Muslim 
Students’ 

Association) or (Intergroup 
Relations). I just don’t see 
how this will be successful 
and I just can’t support this, 
and again, it’s not about the 
money.”

Schafer 
was 
also 

concerned 
with 
the 

structure of the launched 
resolution, primarily who 
would be the mediator as 
it was never clarified and 
only given “surface-level” 
consideration.

“Additionally, 
as 
was 

discussed by some Assembly 
Representatives during 1st and 
2nd reads, this event is closed 
not only to most CSG members, 
but also to the general public,” he 
wrote.

Wes Nakagiri, a Livingston 

County Tea Party activist, has his 

sights set on Kid Rock, Detroit 

native and Trump supporter, for a 

potential Senate candidate in 2018.

“[Kid Rock] has name I.D., is 

an out-of-the-box idea, and would 

kind of get rid of that stodgy 

Republican image,” Nakagiri said 

in an interview with the Detroit 

Free Press.

Michigan Republicans have 

been seeking out a potential 

U.S. Senate seat candidate to 

balance out the Michigan’s party 

unification with Republicans in 

control of all statewide offices. The 

possible election of Kid Rock would 

have implications, as it would 

mean there would be a Republican 

candidate receiving Michigan’s 

electoral votes for the first time 

since 1988.

No candidates have yet been 

announced to oppose Debbie 

Stabenow in 2018; however, 

names proposed at the Michigan 

Republican Party ranged from 

former state senators, such as U.S. 

Rep. Fred Upton (R–St. Joseph) 

and Randy Richardville, former 

Senate Majority Leader from 

Monroe, to the rock artist himself.

“I’ll bet you he would 

generate as much excitement as 

Trump did,” Nakagiri told the 

Free Press.

Ron Weiser, University 

of Michigan regent and 

elected state Republican Party 

chairman, told the Detroit Free 

Press that, while he did not want 

to mention names, he has spoken 

to some potential candidates for 

the position.

“We have to find a candidate 

for the Senate,” Weiser said. 

“Hopefully, someone will step 

forward.”

Many members of the 

party have been looking at less 

conventional candidates in 

an effort to replicate the Trump 

candidacy, which they believe has 

been effective.

“We’ve won pretty much 

everything else,” said Stu 

Standler, Republican consultant, 

to the Detroit Free Press. “This 

is something that’s eluded 

Republicans since 1994, and we 

want to win it back.”

Matthew Lige wrote in the press 
release email.

The 
second 
incident 

occurred the following day, 
when a student reported being 
verbally assaulted and then 
pushed down a hill. While the 
victim and witness statements 
were 
deemed 
credible, 
the 

investigation is no longer active 

due to lack of information 
regarding the assailant.

“The 
area 
where 
the 

assault 
occurred 
did 
not 

have independent video of 

the 
incident,” 
Lige 

wrote. “No suspects could be 
identified as the victim was 
unable to describe the assailant 
beyond a vague clothing and 
physical description. At this 
time, 
this 
investigation 
is 

inactive.”

The third incident involved 

a woman who reported being 
assaulted 
by 
a 
man 
who 

scratched her face with a safety 
pin while she was walking on 
Liberty Street. The incident 
was heavily investigated by 
both AAPD detectives and 
FBI agents, who concluded the 
report was false and the crime 
did not occur.

Investigators 
found 

numerous inconsistencies in 
the victim’s statement and there 
was no surveillance footage of 
the crime to support the report. 
In response, detectives have 
submitted a warrant request for 
criminal charges against the 
Ann Arbor resident who made 
the false report. 

“This 
incident 
originally 

reported was a misdemeanor 
assault,” 
Lige 
wrote. 
“A 

criminal penalty for a false 
police report would also be a 
misdemeanor.”

faculty governance.

Lehman stressed the importance 

of a communicative relationship 
between the provost and the faculty 
governance committees.

“The biggest complaints that 

have come forward historically … 
is too much decision making before 
consultation with the faculty,” 
Lehman said. “It’s come out as an 
issue, and you’re still going to find 
people complaining about this.” 

SACUA member Silke-Maria 

Weineck, a professor of German 
and comparative literature, posed 

concerns about how the next 
provost will lead the University 
through the current contentious 
political climate.

“It seems to me that we may 

be faced with a somewhat very 
hostile federal administration in 
the future,” Weineck said. “I would 
like to see a provost who has various 
game plans to (protect) our various 
vulnerabilities … Somebody who 
has had some serious experience 
interfacing 
with 
government 

would be useful, and possibly 
someone who knows the mind of 
conservatives.”

The conversation then turned 

to whether SACUA would prefer 
a candidate who already works for 
the University or someone from 

outside the community. SACUA 
Secretary David Potter, a professor 
of history and classical studies, 
highlighted the merits of both 
backgrounds, but said he ultimately 
felt an outside perspective could be 
good for the University.

“We’ve had two very successful 

internal 
candidates 
recently, 

following an extremely successful 
external candidate … but the 
perspective an outsider can bring 
(is) that we don’t necessarily need 
to do everything the same way all 
the time,” Potter said. “And I think, 
after a number of years of very good 
internal people, having an external 
candidate might be nice.”

Weineck disagreed with Potter, 

saying the new provost must have 

a knowledge of the University’s 
culture.

“With all of the new deans 

and with (Schlissel) still being 
a bit (new), I don’t think it’s 
strictly a question of inside or 
outside,” Weineck said. “I think 
we do need somebody who has an 
understanding of the identity of the 
University.”

The search committee has 

already had its first meeting 
and elicited the help of a search 
firm. The committee will accept 
applications and nominations until 
the end of the month, at which point 
it will begin confidential interviews 
of select applicants. A new provost 
is expected to be appointed before 
next year’s fall semester.

always be heard and will always 
be heard,” Pamukcu said. “It was 
important when America was 
founded, and is just as important 
today, especially because the 
ways that we now communicate 
are continually changing. The 
law has to keep changing on how 
it interprets speech, and in what 
capacity — does it extend to social 
media, what I say to people when 
I’m working? It’s an amendment 
that will continue to be important 
and 
its 
interpretation 
will 

continue to evolve.”

The 
SPG 
also 
created 

policies 
directed 
specifically 

against 
“Discrimination 
and 

Harassment.” 
This 
in-depth 

policy stance includes definitions 
of the terms and the appropriate 
responses to and procedures 
to follow in these instances, in 
addition to the Regents’ Bylaw 
14.06 and the Nondiscrimination 
Policy Notice already created to 
target these issues.

The 
policy 
clearly 
states 

the 
University 
is 
committed 

to 
maintaining 
an 
academic 

and work environment free of 
discrimination and harassment.

“The 
University 
has 
a 

compelling interest in assuring an 
environment in which learning 
and productive work thrives,” the 
policy reads. “At the same time, 
the University has an equally 
compelling interest in protecting 
freedom of speech and academic 
freedom and in preserving the 
widest possible dialogue within 
its instructional and research 
settings.”

Pamukcu believes there is 

a 
distinction 
between 
hate 

speech and free speech, and the 
University has the discretion to 
decide what classifies as hate 
speech and when the University 
has cause to intervene, especially 
given 
the 
current 
divisive 

political climate.

“Hate speech is one of those 

things 
that 
is 
recognizable, 

you can use common sense,” 
Pamukcu said. “You can see by 
the way they act, the language 
they use, the context they say it 
in — those are all important parts 
about deciding whether someone 
is exercising their own right to 
free speech or they’re using their 
speech to target an individual or 
cause harm to an individual in the 
way that hate speech does.”

For Philosophy Prof. Daniel 

Jacobson, however, freedom of 

speech stands as a prerequisite to 
knowledge, and as such, people 
should be able to defend their 
views against all arguments, 
whether or not some would 
consider it to be “hate speech.”

“There isn’t even a clear 

meaning to the phrase ‘hate 
speech,’ which is one good reason 
not to use the phrase, let alone 
to use it to propose restrictions 
on speech,” Jacobson wrote in 
an email interview. “But the law 
is clear: Hate speech (including 
false, immoral, even harmful 
speech) is protected by the 
Constitution. That is a good thing, 
because if hate speech could be 
suppressed, 
then, 
inevitably, 

unpopular moral and political 
opinions would be labeled as hate 
speech.”

The aforementioned guarantee 

of free speech and the importance 
of diverse opinions was the 
University’s rationale in allowing 
The Michigan Review to utilize 
University space to host two 
contentious figures. Early in the 
primaries of the 2016 presidential 
campaign, Milo Yiannopoulos 
debated against Julie Bindel in 
the Michigan League in February 
2016.

Both 
figures 
are 
banned 

from multiple universities in 
the United Kingdom because 
of their controversial views — 
Yiannopoulos for his opinion that 
feminists invent fake problems 
specifically regarding rape and 
sexual assault, and Bindel for 
her opinions of modern feminists 
and the transgender community. 
Most recently, Yiannopoulos was 
slated to speak at the University 
of California-Berkeley, but after 
violent protests from the student 
body, the university cancelled the 
event.

Many 
students 
expressed 

discontent 
with 
the 
hosting 

of this event, but University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald wrote 
to the Daily in an email at the time 
of the event that the University 
allowed for participation by the 
two aforementioned participants. 
The University is committed to 
allowing freedom of speech and 
opinions for all students and 
outside guests, referencing the 
SPG.

LSA junior Andrew Krieger, 

president of the University’s 
chapter of Young Americans 
for 
Liberty, 
a 
non-partisan 

libertarian group on campus, 
believes the University’s role 
in 
maintaining 
free 
speech 

and censoring hate speech is 
important, but his peers could 
work on being open to others’ 

ideologies.

“So we believe that free speech 

allows for you to challenge your 
ideas and to change the ideas 
of others,” Krieger said. “As far 
the University censoring those 
ideologies, I think that makes 
racism worse in that it solidifies 
their convictions and doesn’t 
allow for them to hear the other 
side.”

For LSA junior Emily Kaufman, 

who identifies as a transwoman, 
Yiannopoulos coming to campus 
was a point of contention, as in 
her opinion, he represents hate 
speech rather than exercising his 
right to free speech.

“I went to the event, and it 

was the most uncomfortable I’ve 
probably ever been in my life,” 
Kaufman said. “It was a lot of 
white men from out of town. The 
kind of people that look like they’d 
beat up a trans girl like me … The 
misrepresentation of feminism 
and having all these people from 
out of town, it wasn’t University 
of Michigan students having a 
productive debate, which could 
have been useful.”

Krieger said Young Americans 

for Liberty does not shy away 
from bringing in controversial 
speakers such as Yiannopoulos 
because it is incredibly beneficial 
to have open dialogues and listen 
to the viewpoints of those with 
different political ideologies than 
one’s own.

“Obviously, 
we 
don’t 
like 

defamation, flat-out lies, threats 
— none of that is acceptable under 
the Constitution,” Krieger said. 
“Unfortunately, the only way 
you’re going to convince people 
with racial ideologies is to have 
discussions with them, and that 
is an issue people don’t like to 
hear and people don’t really want 
to try. For a lot of libertarians, 
free speech is the only way to 
convince people otherwise … I 
don’t like Milo, but it’s sad that 
people aren’t able to come to a 
campus for a fear of their lives.”

Jack 
Bernard, 
associate 

general counsel at the University, 
and Sarah Daniels, associate 
dean of students, spoke about 
the 
University’s 
role 
as 
a 

public institution and the First 
Amendment during a Central 
Student Government meeting in 
December.

Though Bernard and Daniels 

did not specify any incidents, 
their presentation alluded to the 
anti-Islam and politically charged 
messages that have been chalked 
on the Diag, including statements 
such 
as 
“Stop 
Islam” 
and 

“Trump 2016.” The University 

did not remove the chalk, and 
students predominately Muslim, 
eventually 
washed 
off 
the 

writing.

One student who helped wash 

off the chalk messages, Rackham 
student Banen Al-Sheemary, said 
at the time she was frustrated 
with the University’s lack of 
action in response to the chalk 
drawings beyond an email from 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel promoting unity.

“It’s 
irresponsible 
of 
the 

administration 
that 
we 
are 

actually out here with buckets 
of water and napkins to clean 
off these hateful messages and 
the administration isn’t taking 
care of it,” Al-Sheemary said at 
the time. “And not only is the 
administration not taking care 
of it, they are putting us through 
a really difficult process. That 
perpetuates these really racist 
and hateful stereotypes that 
turn into violence and turn into 
students of color feeling unsafe 
on campus.”

Bernard explained the chalk 

writings on the Diag could not be 
interfered with by the University 
if they were not threats of 
violence or other versions of 
unprotected speech, and Daniels 
added the University cannot 
stop people from speaking. Both 
Bernard and Daniels agreed the 
best ways to counteract speech 
was more speech.

Art & Design senior Keysha 

Wall, member of the University 
chapter of BAMN — the Coalition 
to Defend Affirmative Action, 
Integration 
and 
Immigrant 

Rights and Fight for Equality 
By 
Any 
Means 
Necessary— 

took issue with the University’s 
representatives 
during 
the 

CSG 
meeting, 
stating 
the 

chalk drawing incidents were 
representative of a threat toward 
Muslim students.

“You cannot debate fascism,” 

Wall said. “You cannot have a 
discussion with fascism. You have 
to shut that down.”

However, 
the 
University 

was prompted to respond and 
announce its intention to restrict 
the type of speech on alt-right, 
white supremacist posters found 
around 
campus 
on 
multiple 

occasions 
during 
the 
weeks 

leading up to the contentious 
2016 presidential election. The 
posters were primarily anti-
Black and anti-Islam, earlier 
posters advised white women 
not 
to 
become 
romantically 

involved with Black men. After 
many student protests following 
the discovery of these posters, 
Schlissel 
and 
the 
University 

released a statement pertaining 
to the racially charged poster.

“Messages of racial, ethnic or 

religious 
discrimination 
have 

no place at the University of 
Michigan,” the statement read. 
“While we continue to defend 
any individual’s right to free 
speech on our campus, these 
types of attacks directed toward 
any individual or group, based 
on a belief or characteristic, 
are 
inconsistent 
with 
the 

university’s values of respect, 
civility and equality. We also 
have a responsibility to create a 
learning environment that is free 
of harassment.”

The University also stated they 

could not remove the posters 
promoting 
white 
supremacy 

because they were posted in 
public posting spaces.

“Consistent with our policy 

for posting, whenever they are on 
buildings, we can remove them,” 
said former University Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 
during 
the 

Senate Advisory Committee on 
Undergraduate Affairs meeting. 
“If they are on kiosks, they are 
protected by free speech, as they 
should be. Not only do we have 
a constitutional obligation to 
allow all speech no matter how 
heinous, but if you’re going to 
stand by the First Amendment, 
you’re going to stand by the First 
Amendment. But what you have 
to do then is loudly make known 
your abhorrence of this.”

Jacobson thinks the University 

intervening on free speech is an 
illegal act because the University 
is a public institution.

“It is fine to have certain spaces 

where people are ‘safe’ from 
hearing opinions that offend 
them,” Jacobson said. “But the 
idea that the University as a 
whole should be a safe space — 
that it should compel people not 
to express offensive opinions — is 

as misguided as it is impossible 
… And it is impossible because 
everything offends somebody.”

Following the many protests 

and University responses after 
the 2016 election, LSA sophomore 
Amanda 
Delekta 
created 
a 

petition, #NotMyCampus, where 
she stated she felt she faced 
bigotry for holding conservative 
views, and that the University 
administration did not foster 
conversations 
that 
were 

respectful of all ideologies.

“I 
penned 
#NotMyCampus 

after being frustrated at the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

seemingly biased response to the 
2016 election results,” Delekta 
wrote in an email interview. “The 
University is a school and its 
purpose is to educate, but instead 
of fostering an open dialog (sic) 
professors and administrators 
highlighted only one viewpoint 
which validated that ideology 
over that of others which I found 
to create a divisive campus 
climate and create a stigma 
among students of us vs. them.”

Jacobson noted the disparity 

between the progressive and 
conservative 
ideologies 
of 

faculty, favoring the former, is 
problematic because it makes 
students with unpopular political 
opinions 
comfortable 
with 

expressing themselves.

“Many 
fields, 
especially 

in the humanities and social 
sciences, 
have 
become 
so 

politicized that scholars cannot 
succeed unless they hew to a 
leftist party line,” Jacobson 
wrote. “Students are subjected 
to 
political 
indoctrination 

even in courses that are not 
about politics. But perhaps the 
most disappointing aspect of 
the situation is that, despite 
its unquenchable thirst for 
‘diversity,’ the University does 
not really value intellectual and 
political diversity.”

However, Delekta wrote she 

believes freedom of speech 
granted to students covers all 
types of speech, but requires a 
great responsibility.

“With this freedom comes 

great responsibility to use it for 
good, to be critical, but to also 
be 
compassionate,” 
Delekta 

wrote. “I believe hate speech 
is speech with ill intent — with 
no productive purpose beyond 
causing another harm. That 
being said, regardless of how 
insidious and horrible speech 
may be it is protected by the 
Constitution. I in no means 
think hate speech is right, or 
legitimate but it is legal.”

University to increase the number 
of counselors that CAPS had to get 
to a better ratio of counselors to 
students, and originally we were 
at one to 1300, which is below 
where we should be,” Sarkar said. 
“The ideal golden ratio is one to 
1000, and because of the advocacy 
work that happened over the last 
year, the University is actually 
hiring more counselors for CAPS 
now and they will be at one to 
1200, which is not the golden 
ratio, but it’s progress and there’s 
a lot of work to be done and we’re 
excited to do that.”

Sarkar said she is also excited to 

strive for a new policy regarding 
the maximum number of exams 
a student can take in one day. 
Currently, students can take a 
total of four exams in one day, but 
can advocate for three. She hopes 
to get the maximum lowered 
to three, allowing students to 
advocate for two, which is a policy 
she believes will strongly impact 
the mental health and well-being 
of students.

Jawad is deeply involved with 

CSG’s efforts to connect with 
the city of Ann Arbor, especially 
in regards to affordable housing 
and student concerns with the 
increasing high prices. Recently, 
CSG made efforts to convince 
the city to move to nonpartisan 
elections in order to encourage 
more University student turnout.

According 
to 
LSA 
junior 

Cassie Fields, who is running for 
communications director, eMerge 
hopes base its campaign on 
responding and elevating student 
voices, especially the voices that 
have not been involved with CSG 
before.

“We are really trying to look 

at students who are overlooked 
or who may have been left out of 
a lot of dialogues, so we’re trying 
to say, ‘we need to look at all 
walks of life,’ ” she said. “Every 
single person in this school has 
interests, how can we best make 
campus work for them? So we are 
really trying to target advocating 
for student voice so that students 
have their own voice on campus. 
We want them to have their own 
opportunities. There’s so many 
kids who don’t even know how to 
get involved, or they don’t know 
how to find a club or don’t know 
what to do, so we want to be a 

resource 
for them to really 

find their place at Michigan.”

Sarkar said the new party’s title 

derives from this very mission 
statement.

“We seek to rise up, or to 

encourage people to rise up, and 
emerge from where they are 
and get involved in issues that 
they care about,” Sarkar said. “I 
think the political climate over 
the last year or so has shown 
us how important it is to speak 
out if you believe in something, 
because if you don’t speak out, 
your opinion will be silenced.”

eMerge has split its platform 

into 
initiatives, 
short-term 

goals and advocacy, or long-
term goals.

With 
its 
initiatives, 
the 

new party hopes to attain 
more practical goals such as 
additional study spaces, Wi-Fi 
on the Diag and mentorship 
programs for nontraditional, 
multilingual 
and 
first-

generation students.

Advocacy is set for long-

term ideas, such as providing 
study-abroad 
scholarships 

and 
encouraging 
tMichigan 

Medicine, 
formerly 
the 

University of Michigan Health 
System to accept Medicaid.

The team was excited to get 

to work, especially in order to 
prioritize their voters during 
the CSG election season. Party 
co-chair Erin Johnson, Business 
junior, said the party hopes to 
connect with the student body 
in the upcoming months.

“Sometimes with campaigns, 

students feel like a platform 
is being pushed on them, but 
we want people to be able to 
find an initiative and mobilize 
themselves and be able to 
work on things that they’re 
passionate about and then feel 
comfortable coming to us and 
talking about things that they 
want us to help them with,” 
Johnson said.

Campaign manager Arathi 

Sabada, a Business sophomore, 
was planning to reach out to 
student groups in order to be 
representative of the student 
body.

“So we’re definitely going 

to be reaching out to a lot of 
groups, getting their ideas, 
getting 
their 
input 
and 

incorporating those into our 
platform just to make sure 
we’re representing the student 
body as well as possible,” she 
said.

interesting to also think about this 
provost participating in pedagogy 
research.”

Rao also raised the importance of 

a student perspective in the search 
for a provost, as did LSA senior 
David Schafer, president of Central 
Student Government.

“I was very uplifted to hear (the 

committee’s) commitment to ensure 
that students’ voices are heard, and 
that student concerns are weighed 
as part of this search process for 
the next provost,” Schafer said. 
“I encourage any and all students 

as best they can with the provost 
search 
advisory 
committee 
to 

ensure their voices are heard.” 

Schafer thanked Schlissel for the 

inclusion of Public Health student 
Abbas Alawieh in the committee 
and asked Alawieh how he see his 
role.

“I bring to the table, as a 

committee member, all of the 
experiences I have had as an 
undergraduate 
student, 
as 
a 

graduate student and on the Student 
Budget 
Advisory 
Committee,” 

Alawieh said. “I was a resident 
advisor. All of these things which 
are part of the Michigan experience 
are things I will be thinking about 
when I’m thinking about making 
recommendations.”

W

ith 
all 
that 
has 

happened in the past 
few weeks, the idea 

of American exceptionalism has 
seemed even more 
skewed and outdated. 
Both nationally and 
on campus, the new 
political climate has 
been tense and filled 
with 
uncertainty. 

President 
Donald 

Trump’s 
slogan 
of 

“Make 
America 

Great Again” implied 
a return to a better 
nation, 
which 
had 

seemingly been lost in past 
administrations. Yet, the first 
weeks of Trump’s presidency 
have thoroughly worked against 
what makes America exceptional.

At 
its 
core, 
“American 

exceptionalism” is the idea 
that the United States is the 
vanguard of liberty, democracy 
and opportunity — a nation 
unlike any before it, created 
on the basis of equality and 
liberty, 
and 
throughout 

history, a country dedicated 
to upholding and cultivating 
these essential values, both 
abroad and at home. American 
exceptionalism promotes the 
United States as a nation which 
is singular, unique and a leading 
example for other nations. 

My own belief in this definition 

of American exceptionalism is 
wary. The United States’ history 
of being a pillar of equality is 
both skewed and inaccurate. 
Our patriotism is not unlike any 
other democratic nation’s, and 
our true upholding of equality is 
lessened by historic racism and 
discrimination embedded in 
our institutions. 

However, 
recent 
political 

events have made me more 
cynical in viewing America’s 
exceptionalism. Trump’s Cabinet 
appointments, 
his 
executive 

order 
on 
immigration 
and 

the more recent and personal 
racial incidents on our campus 
have 
been 
disheartening, 
to 

say the least. Yes, parts of my 
disappointment hinge on my 
political leanings, but certain 
issues go beyond politics.

Trump’s executive order on 

immigration is a huge step away 
from American exceptionalism. 
If we are considered a country 
of liberty and equality, then we 
should be opening our doors to 

those who need help the most, not 
closing them. The actions Trump 
has taken, or rather has tried to 
take, are symbolic of a different 

kind 
of 
American 

exceptionalism: 
an 

exceptionalism 
that 

promotes equality and 
liberty, but only for the 
few, not the many. 

Furthermore, 
the 

ban goes against what 
I 
believe 
actually 

makes 
the 
United 

States exceptional: the 
people. 
The 
nature 

of Trump’s executive 

order sends a simple message 
to those who come from the 
seven countries affected by it: 
You are not welcome here. Yet, 
this rhetoric, whether enacted 
through law or not, degrades 
the diversity the United States 
has prided itself on. The United 
States has stood out among other 
nations because of its power to 
draw people from all over the 
world onto one land mass, living, 
working and creating. The rich 
diversity of this country is what 
makes it exceptional. Without 
immigrants, the story of American 
innovation, culture and progress 
would be incomplete. 

In addition to the executive 

order, Trump’s war on the press 
seems to be part of his redefining 
of America’s greatness. In a 
collection of tweets, Mr. Trump 
has called out The New York 
Times for fictional reporting, 
or, more accurately, reporting 
that doesn’t praise him. The 
president’s rhetoric toward the 
press again degrades the liberty 
and democracy associated with 
American exceptionalism. The 
press has been a sure check on 
the actions of those in power, 
and, if anything, true freedom 
is found in the truth-telling of 
our journalists. A press that 
depicts 
politics 
truthfully, 

regardless of whether it taints 
the image of the powerful 
elite, is a press that uses its 
First Amendment right to hold 
leaders accountable and give a 
voice to those who otherwise 
wouldn’t have one. Attacking 
the press is attacking one of 
the truest and most historic 
examples of American freedom. 

Yet, while Trump continues 

his 
unexceptional 
actions, 

his 
constituents 
are 
doing 

the 
opposite. 
American 

exceptionalism 
hinges 
on 

democracy and liberty, and while 
Trump may continuously stray 
from these virtues, Americans 
are working to uphold them. A 
Trump presidency may have 
created an upheaval of anger and 
fear, but it has simultaneously 
redefined 
what 
makes 
the 

United 
States 
exceptional. 

Exceptionalism isn’t in the hands 
of a single leader or political 
administration. Exceptionalism 
is in the hands of the people. 

In the past few months, a 

wave of solidarity has made its 
way through the United States 
in a reaction to Trump’s divisive 
nature. 
The 
record-breaking 

Women’s March was just the 
beginning of Americans coming 
together to stand up and speak 
out against injustices heightened 
by Trump’s presidency. Instead 
of idly sitting by, people of all 
backgrounds are taking a stand in 
whatever way they can. 

American 
exceptionalism 

isn’t found in the political 
leaders we have representing us, 
but in our own abilities to stand 
up and speak out against those 
leaders’ actions when we see 
fit. American exceptionalism 
is found in the vast diversity 
of our population and our 
ability to recognize and accept 
our 
differences. 
American 

exceptionalism is found in a 
press that refuses to sugarcoat 
the truth in an effort to please 
the 
powerful. 
American 

exceptionalism 
is 
found 
in 

people 
protesting 
executive 

orders outside airports, even if 
they aren’t affected. American 
exceptionalism 
is 
found 
in 

four judges working against an 
executive order, blocking what 
would be an injustice to many. 
American 
exceptionalism 
is 

found in a group of students 
standing outside a university 
president’s 
house 
in 
the 

middle of the night, calling for 
accountability and change.

This 
is 
American 

exceptionalism. It isn’t who 
we have in the highest seat of 
our government, but how 
we stand up against the 
injustices and divisiveness 
he may promote. That is 
exceptionality.

T

he 
sociology 
classes 

I’ve been taking this 
semester have taught me 

just how messed up our country 
is. I’ve been learning 
about class inequality 
more 
in-depth 
and 

how 
people 
of 
all 

races from lower-class 
backgrounds 
can’t 

achieve the American 
Dream. 
I 
realized 

this a while ago, but it 
pains me that others 
don’t feel the same way 
as me, especially in 
regards to education. 

What can we do to help give 

children in poorer schools a better 
chance of success? Why do we not 
do more to help the needy? Why 
do people have a “pull yourself 
up by your bootstraps” mentality 
when some people can’t afford 
boots in the first place?

Many people know that the 

system is rigged for many to 
succeed and make a comfortable 
living. For generations, people 
have been angry about where they 
stand and how their government 
has forgotten about them.

All these questions rattle 

around in my mind when I think 
that it’s a no-brainer that millions 
of people who are abandoned, 
pushed to the outskirts and not 
given help should at least be 
given better schooling in order 
to to have a more decent life. The 
people who live in poor areas 
of the country need assistance 
because we don’t all live on an 
equal playing field. And life isn’t 
a game — it can’t be replayed. 
It’s a fact that children acquire 
wealth from their parents’ hard 
work and privilege and career 
types, but what about the kids 
who aren’t so fortunate to have 
inheritances or two parents 
around or to have attended a 
well-funded school? 

For me, it’s important that 

people 
are 
knowledgeable 

about our education system 
— how teachers should be 

more 
valued 
and 

that 
every 
kid 

deserves a quality 
education 
— 
but 

right now that isn’t 
happening. Schools 
are dilapidated and 
closing in Detroit 
because of low test 
scores. Who is that 
helping? How will 
these kids get to 
school?

While these kids have their 

schools close and attend school 
in classes infested with mold, a 
school not far away in Bloomfield 
Hills has a fireplace and statues 
in a courtyard. The parents of 
students at that school have 
the means to help pay for these 
luxuries, making the playing field 
more uneven. The money is being 
used to help the school have nice 
classrooms, adequate textbooks 
and clean hallways before these 
little luxuries. It’s not necessarily 
a crime to have all this in a school, 
but it’s a stark contrast from 
other schools, where the water 
from fountains is undrinkable 
and bathrooms are falling apart. 
Yes, there are other factors we 
can take into account, such as 
parenting and the kid’s own work 
ethic, but can we really blame 
someone’s lack of success when 
they’re not put in an environment 
where they’re prepared to excel? 

To the people reading this, I 

might be barking up the wrong 
tree. But at the same time, there 
are many people out there who 
don’t have the same perspective 
as the one I have shared. And 
it’s not entirely their fault. 
They may have been exposed 
to entirely different opinions, 
taught a different way or could 

be oblivious to the complexity of 
inequality in our country. 

With that in mind, I’ve 

been trying to embrace the 
philosophy of loving instead 
of judging. I don’t think it’s 
right for me to judge someone 
right off the bat based on a 
comment or belief before having 
a conversation with them. It’s 
better to enter a conversation 
with an open mind, choosing to 
love and listening to understand, 
rather than to respond. 

Especially with how clear it 

is that our country is divided, 
we should strive for education 
and conversation instead of 
immediately passing judgment. 
It will be difficult — and 
sometimes impossible — to 
change someone’s mind or to get 
them to listen, but maybe giving 
them a chance will be beneficial 
to both sides.

It’s probably not best to 

discuss 
these 
issues 
over 

social media, because the best 
sentiments never seem to get 
across there, but whether on 
social media or in person, 
telling your side of the story 
is important. The injustices in 
our country can get our blood 
boiling. And it makes me even 
more infuriated when people 
aren’t upset, coming off as 
selfish or apathetic. Those who 
seem like they don’t care may 
be in fact be self-centered. But 
at the same time, there might 
be some who just don’t know or 
were misinformed. 

It’s better to love instead of 

judge. Progress is more likely 
attainable when we’re united 
and informed. Take a deep 
breath while your blood is 
boiling and try to give people 
the benefit of the doubt. 

Love, don’t judge

FROM THE DAILY

The U must step up under DeVos
F

ollowing fierce protests and fiery criticism, Betsy DeVos was 
confirmed as secretary of education on Feb. 7 in a historic tie-breaking 
vote by Vice President Mike Pence. DeVos, former chairwoman of 

the Michigan Republican Party and a billionaire businesswomen, has never 
attended public school, been an educator or directed any department of 
education. She is a strong supporter of school choice and student voucher 
programs, which threaten many important facets of our nation’s education, 
including the education of marginalized groups such as racial minorities, 
students of low socioeconomic status, students with disabilities and 
survivors of sexual assault. Given DeVos’s appointment as secretary of 
education, The Michigan Daily Editorial Board calls upon the University 
of Michigan to continue to support the best interests of students, even as 
efforts to protect students may wane at the federal level.

DeVos’s support of school choice 

has implications on the racial and 
socioeconomic 
compositions 
of 

primary and secondary schools 
and the quality of their education. 
Charter 
schools 
in 
Michigan, 

especially 
in 
Detroit, 
have 

historically 
performed 
poorly. 

While studies have shown charter 
schools — under close monitoring 
— can increase racial integration in 
segregated communities, DeVos’s 
lack of commitment to the oversight 
of charter schools will not likely 
secure optimistic outcomes. What’s 
more, it is troubling that DeVos is 
not taking a more critical stance 
on charter schools, given their 
lack of success in her home state 
of Michigan. This will ultimately 
have deleterious effects on student 
preparedness and access to higher 
education, and, by extension, to 
diversity on campus.

DeVos’s 
apparent 
lack 
of 

knowledge and commitment to 
protecting the Individuals with 
Disabilities 
Education 
Act 
is 

extremely concerning, especially 
because students with disabilities 
can be harmed by the voucher 
programs she supports. For example, 
Florida’s voucher program requires 
that students with disabilities who 
receive vouchers waive their rights 
normally afforded under IDEA. And 
while this issue could hypothetically 
be solved by strict regulation, 
DeVos’s adamant opposition to any 
uniform regulation on public school 

activities during her confirmation 
hearings makes it all but certain 
that necessary regulations to protect 
special education students will be 
absent from DeVos’s administration. 
Since K-12 education is integral 
to college access, the University 
should 
remain 
proactive 
in 

creating pathways to access post-
secondary education for students 
potentially 
marginalized 
by 

DeVos’s lack of oversight.

She seems to know very little 

about financial aid and student debt, 
as demonstrated in her uncertainty 
regarding how financial aid and 
Federal Pell Grants work. When 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) 
questioned 
DeVos 
about 
how 

she plans on protecting students’ 
finances, 
DeVos’s 
response 

confirmed she was unaware of the 
laws in place to prevent monetary 
waste, fraud and abuse. Such 
ambivalence is especially concerning 
in light of the $25 million settlement 
President Donald Trump dealt out 
to students who were cheated when 
they enrolled in Trump University. 
The 
University 
should 
remain 

proactive in ensuring students’ 
resources 
are 
being 
expended 

properly while working toward 
tuition affordability.

Finally, DeVos has not shown 

a commitment to upholding her 
department’s 2011 Title IX guidance, 
which 
requires 
colleges 
and 

universities to play a role in fighting 
sexual assault on campus. DeVos 

has donated to the Foundation for 
Individual Rights in Education, 
an organization that supported 
a bill that would ban institutions 
from prosecuting and investigating 
reports 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 

without a survivor making a police 
report. While many universities’ 
handlings of sexual misconduct 
cases have been problematic, we 
believe that universities’ involvement 
in 
sexual 
misconduct 
cases 

independent of law enforcement 
officials must be maintained given a 
university’s unique role in a student’s 
life. Eliminating a student’s option 
of only reporting misconduct to a 
university restricts survivors’ choice 
of how they would like to handle the 
matter. We implore the University 
to continue providing all current 
methods of recourse to sexual assault 
survivors that are legally permissible, 
even if the federal government 
quashes current protective federal 
policies. It is no less the responsibility 
of the University to help survivors of 
sexual assault and mitigate gender 
discrimination on campus.

The University must continue 

its 
commitment 
to 
protecting 

victims of sexual assault, students 
with disabilities and marginalized 
groups. Betsy DeVos’s confirmation 
will have tangible consequences for 
all students, and it is necessary that 
the University’s students, faculty 
and staff fight back against policies 
that fail to provide a safe and quality 
education experience for everyone.

O

n Feb. 6, your newspaper 
ran an article called “City 
Council hears concerns 

from protest over Ann Arbor’s status 
as a sanctuary city” with the image 
of my hijab-clad face in focus. There 
are many reasons why this came as a 
surprise to me. However, after some 
thought, perhaps I should not have 
been surprised at all.

I am a graduate student from 

Bangladesh at the University of 
Michigan 
on 
a 
nonimmigrant 

student 
visa. 
I 
am 
neither 

undocumented, nor am I seeking 
immigration. 
I 
do 
believe 
in 

my 
fellow 
undocumented 
and 

immigrant community members’ 
rights to civil liberties and to this 
land that they have helped build on 
their backs.

Due to the many particularities 

of my identity that the photographer 
seemed to have brushed off or not 
taken the time to investigate, I 
could not be and was not present 
at this event representing the 
undocumented/immigrant 
community of Ann Arbor. I did 
not officially belong to any of the 
protest groups either. I was quietly 
standing at the back of the room 
as a concerned, temporary Ann 
Arbor resident taking notes on the 
proceedings. There were active 
protesters with meaningful signs 
at the front of the room. Ann Arbor 
resident Julie Quiroz gave an 
impassioned speech and made a 
substantial case for Ann Arbor to 

become a sanctuary city. When I 
saw my face on your Feb. 6 issue of 
The Michigan Daily, I wondered 
why my muted, demure face was 
deemed a better representation of 
the sanctuary city movement than 
the faces of all the colorful and 
vocal protesters.

I 
wondered 
what 
the 

photographer thought when they 
plastered my face to the article. Were 
they catering to patronizing white 
liberals? (“Look, this oppressed soul 
is who you are ‘saving’ by making 
Ann Arbor a sanctuary city?”) Were 
they trying to inspire hostile alt-
right rebuke? (“Look, this symbol 
of Islamic terrorism is who you are 
inviting into your homes.”)

My hijab-wearing identity is 

always a tool of political dissonance, 
never individual, never personal and 
never complex. My image in your 
article will never be interpreted as an 
image of an ardent ally, a participant 
like the rest of the audience with 
personal views and opinions on 
the issue at hand, but always as the 
dehumanized object that is being 
debated, fought over.

We, 
Muslim 
hijabi 
women, 

are made to lend our molded 
(reshaped to meet the Western 
audience’s rhetorical comfort) faces 
to movements, without regard to 
what our personal politics might be 
or where we might want to place 
ourselves in the spectrum of the 
movement. The whitewashed and 
unapologetically jingoistic image of 

the American-flag-wearing hijabi 
woman in Shepard Fairey’s “We 
the People” poster series is a recent 
example. The June 1985 National 
Geographic cover of the young 
Sharbat Gula, reduced to being called 
the “Afghan girl” with “haunting 
green eyes” is another. 

I am not making a case against any 

form of representation. I am making 
a case for nuanced, contextualized 
representation. 
I 
am 
inquiring 

the motivation behind each cycle 
of 
representation, 
the 
political 

functionalities and audiences each 
representation serves.

I could go on and on about the 

appropriation of the hijab in Western 
media. In an effort to not shift focus 
from an otherwise-important piece 
on the state of sanctuary cities, I 
will leave you with this request: As 
a media institution, ask yourselves 
what role you play in politicizing my 
face. Ask yourselves if your use of my 
face is further legitimizing dominant 
narratives about Muslim women, 
or if it’s challenging them. Ask 
yourselves if you are dehumanizing 
my face by stripping it out of a 
holistic context to make your larger, 
oversimplified political statements. 
When you wage your political wars 
on Muslim women’s bodies, ask 
yourselves if you have counted 
the casualties.

For 59th time, Grammy 
Awards ignore Black art

Exploring the ceremony’s history of racial underrepresentation 

On Sunday night, after almost 

twenty 
years 
of 
consistently 

committing mortal sins against 
the gods of hip-hop, the Recording 
Academy attempted to repent with 
the culture at the 59th Grammy 
Awards by decorating Chance 
the Rapper and his latest project, 
Coloring 
Book, 
which 
wasn’t 

distributed by a major record label, 
with golden trophies intended to 
symbolize a new understanding of, 
and appreciation for, underground 
music.

Having 
spent 
months 

campaigning to make his freely-
distributed 
music 
eligible 
for 

awards, Chance seemed to have 
all his wishes granted, professing 
unswerving 
thankfulness 
to 

the Lord before blessing the 
stage himself with a soulful 
performance. But for hip-hop at 
large, this meager victory is not 
enough: Iconic figures are still not 
being invited into the room.

In 1989, DJ Jazzy Jeff & 

the Fresh Prince won the first 
Grammy for rap music, but they, 
like all other nominees in the 
category, refused to attend the 
ceremony, as they felt overlooked 
by programmers’ decision not to air 
the award’s reception. Five years 
later, Tony Bennett took home the 
trophy for best album in the same 
year that revolutionary hip-hop 
classics illmatic, Ready to Die and 
Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik 
had been released.

In the early 2000s, breakout 

sensation 50 Cent lost Best New 
Artist to Evanescence and the 
Black Eyed Peas won best Rap Duo/
Group two-years running. Finally, 
most painfully, Lil Wayne’s Tha 
Carter III lost Album of the Year 
to a Robert Plant/Allison Krauss 
collaboration, a tough triumph that 
any reasonable person who owned 
a radio in 2007 should be willing to 
admit was a mistake.

Sure, 
the 
Grammy’s 
took 

some 
relevant 
steps 
towards 

taste-making 
this 
year, 
such 

as enlisting Anderson .Paak to 
perform alongside A Tribe Called 
Quest, as well as including De La 
Soul and ScHoolboy Q in its rap 
nominees. But still, Drake’s Views, 
an articulately-marketed package 
of music that’s been largely deemed 
stale by rap fans, was the genre’s 
only representation in the top 
category, and its singsong single, 
“Hotline Bling,” which is now 
eighteen-months-old, won best rap 
song.

Sure, Lil Yachty was on scene, 

having snuck himself into the 
commercial realm through a four-
times-platinum guest-feature on 
D.R.A.M.’s hit single, “Broccoli.” 
But Young Thug, Travis Scott, 
Gucci Mane, Lil Uzi Vert, 21 
Savage, Migos and Metro Boomin’, 
all populist champions who have 
indefinitely defined the most recent 
era in hip-hop, both sonically and 
aesthetically, don’t seem to have 
received their invitations to the 
ceremony, which still, despite all 
its shortcomings, labels itself with 
the notoriously cringe-worthy title: 
“Music’s Biggest Night.”

Two weeks ago, TMZ reported 

that neither Kanye West, Justin 
Bieber 
nor 
Drake 
would 
be 

attending the Grammy’s ceremony, 
following the leadership of cult-
icon Frank Ocean, who didn’t 
even submit his platinum-selling, 
critically-acclaimed LP Blonde for 
nominations.

“That 
institution 
certainly 

has nostalgic importance. It just 
doesn’t seem to be representing 
very well for people who come 
from where I come from, and hold 
down what I hold down,” Ocean 
said in a statement.

The news was particularly 

noteworthy as West, Bieber and 
Drake combined were nominated 
for twenty awards and, honestly, 
carry half of the internet’s attention 
around the world with them. But 
these male, pop figureheads don’t 
think the Grammys are getting 
things right, a complaint that’s 
too common to ignore, even after 
the Academy’s 59th attempt at 
awarding great art.

Last February, Kanye West sent 

out a string of tweets that trolled 
the Academy for its blatant lack of 
appreciation for Black culture.

“I think the Grammys are 

super important!!!” he began, 
diving deeper into his frustrations 
by noting, “I know so many cool 
artists whose hearts have been 
broken by the politics including 
mine,” before finally speaking on 
behalf of almost four decades of 
misunderstood rap brilliance.

“You like your Black people a 

certain way also. You wouldn’t 
have Future perform and that man 
owned the clubs last summer,” 
Kanye tweeted, going on to use the 
Atlanta-raised trap-rap sensation 
as a symbolic marty for the culture. 
“Has anyone at the Grammys 
ever heard “March Madness”??? 
Yes I have a problem with the 
Grammys,” he wrote, before finally 
proposing a perfectly reasonable, 
tangible solution: “We need to see 
Young Thug at the Grammys. Not 
just me and Jay in a suit.”

***

“All us artists here, we fucking 

adore you. You are our light, and 
the way you make me and my 
friends feel, the way you make my 
Black friends feel, is empowering, 
and you make them stand up for 
themselves,” Adele confessed to 
her apparent idol, Beyoncé, in the 
final moments of the 59th Grammy 
Awards on Sunday night.

This was during her acceptance, 

or, more accurately, denial speech 
for Album of the Year, an award 
that her 25 won over Beyonce’s 
Lemonade in what will surely be 
remembered as another time the 
Grammy’s 
chose 
conventional 

excellence 
over 
difficult, 

breathtaking, truly trailblazing 
Black art. Adele’s praise also came 
just moments before she snapped 
her trophy in half, seemingly to 
give part of it to Beyoncé.

As tough of a fact as it is may be 

for some to swallow, Kanye West’s 
February 2016 Twitter rant about 
the Academy bears significant 
weight.

“I feel the Grammy awarding 

system is way off and completely 
out 
of 
touch,” 
West 
wrote, 

something that even its most 
decorated victor of 2017 seems to 
agrees with. But of course, that was 
before he packed in some signature 
Kanye-isms, such as: “If I’m not at 
the show next year then there is no 
show.”

Yes, the Grammy ceremony 

happened, 
without 
Kanye 

West, Justin Bieber or Drake in 
attendance; 
without 
awarding 

Beyoncé her hard-earned Album 
of the Year trophy; without 
accrediting the most important 
hip-hop figures of the year; but 
once again, we’re unsure if the 
Academy’s opinions are relevant 
in the first place. Once again, its 
disconnection from the culture, 
the listeners, those who stay 

awake at night awaiting their 
favorite artists’ releases and line 
up for blocks when those stars’ 
whereabouts become known, is too 
apparent to ignore.

Sure, 
Chance 
the 
Rapper, 

underground 
champion 
and 

indie-darling, has been anointed 
a figurehead of the mainstream, 
having won Best New Artist and 
a couple of hip-hop Grammys 
without ever selling a single 
album. But it’s important that he 
had influential online outlets like 
Complex, illroots, Fake Shore 
Drive and Pitchfork pushing his 
music for years, and also had to 
reinvent himself into a family-
friendly, colorful rap figure before 
ending up on stage.

***

Chance the Rapper absolutely 

deserves all the success that he’s 
gotten; I don’t think there’s a single 
hip-hop head in America who 
would say otherwise. But right 
now, Chano is one in a million, a 
rare mixtape rapper who managed 
to maneuver his music onto official 
streaming platforms and establish 
a network of committed fans to 
campaign for his success. Finally, 
after every other tastemaker in 
the game deemed him an icon, 
the Academy did the inevitable 
by acknowledging his existence. 
They didn’t break down any walls 
though, if you think about it.

Chance 
the 
Rapper’s 
2017 

decoration is a victory for hip-
hop somewhat like Lauryn Hill’s 
in 1999, when she won Album of 
the Year with her classic LP The 
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. It was 
a remarkable feat for the culture, 
but the Academy’s late realization 
that Ms. Hill was an iconic talent 
becomes less honorable when we 
consider that they awarded Celine 
Dion’s My Heart Will Go On the 
trophy for Album of the Year just 
two years prior, when The Fugee’s 
masterpiece The Score would’ve 
been eligible to claim the prize.

Right now, it’s fine to celebrate 

the victories of our favorite 
Chicago superhero, Lil Chano from 
79th, a.k.a. Chance the Rapper. It’s 
also okay to watch his Coloring-
Book-mash-up 
performance 

on repeat all day, then proceed 
to replay the album all week, 
constantly realizing you missed 
many important details on all of 
your former listens. But it’s equally, 
if not more, important to mourn 
Beyonce’s devastating loss. It’s 
equally, if not more, important to 
keep hoping that next year will be 
different.

Until a ceremony can finally 

conclude 
without 
a 
winner 

apologizing to the populist-elect, 
the Academy has work to do. I 
won’t allow them, or the mass 
media, or even Chance the Rapper 
himself, to claim their recognition 
of one, single mixtape rapper as 
sufficient 
acknowledgement 
of 

worldwide scene.

Sure, the Academy squeezed 

Lee “Q” O’Denat, who founded 
the 
vital 
online 
platform 

WorldStarHipHip.com and passed 
away this month, into its annual 
eulogy reel, but they still left out 
Shawty Lo. Sure, they’ve now 
declared freely-distributed music 
eligible for awards, but Chance the 
Rapper hardly had time to shout 
out “DJ DRAMA for doing it first” 
before the music cut his speech off. 
What about DJ Esco, DJ Whoo 
Kid and the rest of the unawarded 
figureheads?

I, much like Kanye West, want 

to see Young Thug at the Grammys. 
Here’s to hoping next year that 
might become a reality.

NYFW Report: Jeremy 
Scott’s ‘Cult of Personality’

At Jeremy Scott’s fall-winter 

2017 show, heaven and hell rode 
in tandem.

Though 
the 
overflowing 

venue space could have doubled 
as Satan’s living room, the 
presence of Jesus was palpable. 
I don’t mean that in a coercive, 
Mike Pence’s America type of 
way; JC’s face was plastered 
across look after look in a style 
reminiscent of the romantic 
era. His eyes followed you from 
the front of Gigi Hadid’s pants. 
Juxtaposed against vixen-like 
cheetah prints and chunky 
dominatrix boots, the angel 
and devil had their first shared 
moment of glory since their 
interactions on the shoulders of 
Kronk in “The Emperor’s New 
Groove.”

The 
good-versus-evil 

symbolism became a bit more 
nuanced toward the show’s 
latter end. A dress in an 

overtly innocent, babydoll cut 
touted “Sex is Cute” in large, 
equally 
loopy 
lettering. 
A 

feathered showgirl headdress 
was paired alongside a crew-
neck 
sweatshirt 
fit 
for 
a 

kindergartener. 
Supermodel 

offspring 
Anna 
Cleveland 

sported 
a 
fringed 
skirt, 

reminiscent of the ever-sinful 
1920s, juxtaposed against a 
pure white cape emblazoned 
with angel wings. Soon, the 
looks appeared to exclusively 
focus on this moral conflict’s 
place in the United States. 
Leather and velvet pieces in 
bright, childlike hues served 
both as an emblem of American 
excess and an appreciation of 
the genuine liberty to which the 
USA lays claim. Old western-
style music (banjos, deep male 
drawl and the like) blared 
through the speakers, followed 
by Depeche Mode’s “Personal 
Jesus” 
on 
full 
blast. 
The 

production’s final moments, 
including the shimmering “As 
Seen on TV” tank, felt nearly 

satirical. 

Perhaps 
the 
paradox 

presented in Scott’s “Cult of 
Personality” mimics that of 
our country. Since our very 
beginnings, we have claimed 
to support the honest and 
good over all else. And yet 
here we are, with a hateful 
businessman at the helm of a 
ship built by those he hopes to 
eject. It comes as no surprise, 
then, that members of Scott’s 
show staff were asked to wear 
custom tee shirts that read 
“Our Voice is the Only Thing 
that Will Protect Us” on the 
front, and listed the names and 
phone numbers of each state’s 
Senators on the back.

Sure, the metaphor of the 

up and the down is a bit more 
simple than what’s going on 
in our nation, but there is 
something to be said about a 
man who can say this much 
through his clothes. Hats off to 
you, Jeremy, and to the angels 
and devils living on all of our 
shoulders.

‘Wick’ turns action to art

SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT

Keanu Reeves as John Wick

Sequel delivers and shows potential to expand the franchise

“John Wick: Chapter Two” does 

almost everything a good sequel 
should. It quickly differentiates 
itself from the first chapter, yet 
still recalls what made the original 
film such an exhilarating ride. 
It’s darker and more complex 
than its predecessor, and it uses 
the larger budget granted to it by 
the previous film’s box office and 
critical success to expand its story 
and bring it to new locales that, 
of course, make for spectacular 
stages for the bread and butter of 
the film: the action.

And on that account, “John 

Wick: Chapter Two” delivers. 
Oh, does it deliver. Each action 
scene, from beginning to end, is 
distinct and memorable all on its 
own — though they are still better 
viewed in sequence, the better to 
appreciate the sense of escalation 
from one to the next both in terms 
of scale and the sheer luridness of 
it all. It’s hard to choose a favorite 
simply because they’re all made to 
the same breathtaking degree of 
excellence, though the many fights 
between Wick (Keanu Reeves, 
“The Matrix”) and bodyguard 
Cassian (Common, “Selma”) earn 
points for brutality, creativity and 
perfectly displayed dry wit.

As he did with the original “John 

Wick,” stuntman-turned-director 
Chad Stahelski uses his training to 
turn action into an art form. Again 

utilizing the “Gun-Fu” approach 
to shootouts that the original 
pioneered, each action scene is 
a 
meticulously 
choreographed 

marvel that keeps the level of 
excitement high for the entire film. 
They are cut and shot so perfectly 
that it would be shocking if the 
film as a whole isn’t remembered 
as one of the best action films of 
the year.

Of course, even 

when bullets aren’t 
being traded by the 
dozen, “John Wick: 
Chapter Two” is 
engaging due to 
the simple pleasure 
of time spent in 
this 
cinematic 

world. The original 
constructed a world 
of respectable assassins bound by a 
strange set of bylaws and manners, 
and proved that nothing beats two 
men in immaculate suits buying 
each other drinks and talking 
about how they’ll kill each other. 
Here, audiences are given more 
of a look into how this world is 
governed with a trip to Rome that 
dominates much of the first half. 
The wider scale that results makes 
“Chapter Two” more enjoyable 
than its predecessor, even as it 
occasionally loses track of its plot.

Within 
the 
geopolitical 

thrills and networks of homeless 
assassins, the script from Derek 
Kolstad (“The Package”) never 
loses sight of its characters. John’s 
struggle to move beyond his past 

and prove to himself he can be 
more than a killer is familiar, but 
Reeves’ alternatingly desperate 
and dead-eyed performance — as 
well as the character’s humanizing 
love of dogs — conveys it in a unique 
and relatable way. Ian McShane 
(“Pirates of the Caribbean: On 
Stranger Tides”) returns as one of 
the most spinoff-able characters 

in 
modern 

action films, the 
delightfully genteel 
manager of a ritzy 
hotel for assassins, 
and he is thankfully 
given 
more 
to 

do than in the 
original, including 
a part in the most 
emotionally intense 
scene of the film.

There’s a sense while watching 

both “John Wick” films, that 
the character has a franchise 
future waiting for him — that 
Wick could hypothetically live 
on through the years and even 
outstay Reeves in the role, like 
an American James Bond raised 
to the power of Jason Bourne. 
Every corner of the neon-tinged, 
testosterone-fueled world feels 
as if it conceals more stories 
to tell, more characters to 
unfurl, more action set pieces 
to unleash. A third film has 
already been announced, with 
more potentially to follow, and if 
they are to the standard the first 
two films have set, we should all 
consider ourselves very lucky.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“Mannequin 
Pussy” 
— 
a 

seriously provocative name for 
a four-piece band with serious 
talent. When the name first 
crossed my computer screen 
on Twitter, my first thought 
was, “I need this band in my 
life,” and I could not have been 
more correct. It’s no secret that 
the Daily is a fan of the band’s 
work. So when I sat down with 
them last Saturday before their 
set in Toledo and asked them 
why I couldn’t find anything 
about their tantalizing name, I 
couldn’t have been more startled 
by the response: “That’s because 
we don’t answer that question.”

The reply came from lead 

vocalist/guitarist 
Marisa 

Dabice, who followed up with: 
“Well, we have, but it’s just 
there’s no good story. Truly, I 
promise you.”

Thus began my ten minutes 

with the band, as we chatted 
about their phenomenal new 
LP Romantic, making music 
and touring with Joyce Manor 
and AJJ, some of punk’s most 
popular bands at the moment.

The most striking aspect of 

Mannequin Pussy’s music is 
its 
effortless 
differentiation 

and 
impressive 
blending 
of 

hardcore 
with 
poppy, 
even 

shoegazey tones. Each track is 
so wonderfully distinct, yet fits 
so comfortably into the rhythm 
of the record. Throughout its 
17-minute run time, emotional 
intensity, vocal style and verse 
structure 
are 
produced 
in 

incredibly varied forms.

“We all have like a really 

diverse 
appreciation 
for 

different styles of music, and I 
think that easily kind of seeps 
into our writing style,” Dabice 
said.

Between 
structured 
pop 

anthems like “Emotional High” 

and paratactical heavy-hitter 
“Ten,” it’s astounding that the 
band was able to consolidate 
their different influences into 
a cohesive album. Dabice also 
gave some interesting insight on 
the writing of individual tracks.

“The lyrics usually come the 

very, very last. Sometimes when 
I’m recording them is when I 
finally figure out the flow that 
I want to be saying something,” 
Dabice said. There’s some things 
where it’s like you know exactly 
that this is what you want to say, 
and this is how you want to say 
it.”

“And then sometimes when 

you allow yourself to just listen 
to a demo again and again and 
again, you find yourself going at 
it different ways until you find 
the thing that really feels right.”

Even with the lyrics filing 

in last, they’re still poignant 
and emotionally charged. Most 
notably is Dabice’s declaration 
“And I am not ashamed to be 
lonely / but I’m afraid to feel 
it so deeply” on opening track 
“Kiss.”

Dabice 
discussed 
with 

Bandcamp 
how 
the 
title 

Romantic refers to the idea 
of Romanticism, and dealing 
with human emotion. In our 
interview, Dabice expanded on 
how Romanticism applies to the 
title track.

“I’d say for me [“Romantic” 

is] probably the most personal 
song on the record. It was 
written maybe just a few weeks 
before we started recording 
the album,” Dsbice said. “It’s 
definitely a very personal song, 
and so much of the Romantic Era 
is understanding your emotions 
and accepting them and seeing 
yourself through things … Is 
there a girl licking the window 
outside?”

“Yeah, 
she 
licked 
the 

window,” replied lead guitarist 
Thanasi Paul.

“This show is going to be 

wild,” Dabice said.

Mannequin 
Pussy 
are 

seasoned 
veterans 
of 
the 

wildness and unpredictability of 
the punk scene. In describing an 
incident where Joyce Manor’s 
drummer broke a pedal, Colins 
“Bear” 
Regisford 
said: 
“I 

was like, ‘Oh my god!’ And I 
immediately was like, ‘Kaleen, 
we need your kick pedal!’ But 
I forget that there’s a team of 
people who are just like ‘don’t 
worry’ and they just did it. 
It’s like, ohhh, this isn’t DIY 
anymore.”

Mannequin 
Pussy 
are 

embracing 
the 
comforts 
of 

touring beyond the DIY scene 
while still playing with the zeal 
of a DIY band in a basement.

“Things have a tendency to 

write themselves and to fall into 
place the way that they have 
to. And I think that things are 
definitely really starting to for 
us which is exciting,” Dabice 
said.

In gaining popularity, the 

band has found stability and 
deserved 
confidence, 
which 

was shown in their blistering 
performance.

Reflecting 
on 
this 
fierce 

performance, it’s clear that 
emotionality 
is 
what 
has 

brought the band so much 
attention. All of the sonic rage 
heard in the band’s work was 
fully unleashed in one beautiful, 
romantic 
performance. 
I 

recalled a particular statement 
from Dabice:

“I think there’s something 

very 
romantic 
about 

understanding the way that 
you feel and kind of allowing 
yourself to struggle through 
things as well. And to like be 
really open and honest about 
that.”

Provocative, mysterious band 

name aside, Mannequin Pussy’s 
most 
attention-demanding 

quality 
is 
their 
emotional 

honesty.

Dan Brown in FX’s ‘Legion’
‘Legion’ forges alt-reality

In new FX and Marvel collab, perceptions of reality are tested

“Is this real?” David Haller 

(Dan Stevens, “Downton Abbey”) 
asks at the end of the head-
spinning premiere of “Legion.” 
A collaboration between FX and 
Marvel Studios, “Legion” is as 
untraditional a superhero show 
as they come. Some of this can 
probably be attributed to its creator, 
Noah Hawley (“Fargo”). But even 
by Hawley’s standards, “Legion” 
is a risky endeavor, as it dives into 
a world where reality and the mind 
continuously clash.

Diagnosed 
with 
paranoid 

schizophrenia, David has spent 
the last six years of his life in 
the 
Clockworks 
Psychiatric 

Hospital, living on a daily regime 
of medication and routine with no 
end in sight.

“I tell them I’m sane, they think 

I’m crazy. And if I say, ‘you’re 
right, I am crazy,’ then they up my 
dosage,” David says, explaining his 
catch-22 to his sister Amy (Katie 
Aselton, “The League”). He goes on 
warning, “Something new needs to 
happen soon.”

That “something new” comes in 

the form of Sydney Barrett (Rachel 
Fuller, “Fargo”), a new patient with 
a mysterious aversion to touch, 
who immediately captures David’s 
attention. “What if your problems 
aren’t in your head? What if they 
aren’t your problems?” Syd wonders 
out loud in a therapy session, and 
so the world of “Legion” begins to 
open its doors.

The truth (or so it seems) is 

that David is a mutant, one with 
incredible power and very little 
control over it. But this revelation 
only opens up more questions as the 
pilot moves forward. Figures who 
lurk in the shadows of David’s mind 
become even more mysterious and 
complex. What were once thought 
to be hallucinations or non-existent 
voices become something perhaps 
even more sinister and threatening. 
All the while, the true nature of 
David’s mind and memories remain 

elusive, with each unraveling plot 
thread twisting and obscuring 
another aspect of the larger 
tapestry.

The 
premiere, 
directed 
by 

Hawley, uses as many tricks 
as it can to help construct the 
headspace that is David’s mind. 
From 
point-of-view 
shots 
to 

wide-angle lenses warping the 
edges of the screen, Hawley and 
cinematographer (Dana Gonzales, 
“Criminal”) continually shift the 
viewing experience into something 
new as David’s mind is tossed 
and thrown around. A noticeably 
adjusting aspect ratio in one scene 
signals paranoia as threats, both 
real and perceived, 
close 
in 
around 

David. Meanwhile, 
the entire screen 
turns 
upside-

down 
after 
one 

particularly world-
shaking 
action. 

Accompanying this 
visual flare is a tense 
score by Jeff Russo (“The Night 
Of”) that walks the line between 
emotional and foreboding while a 
soundtrack that includes The Who, 
The Rolling Stones and Jane’s 
Addiction serves to punctuate 
David’s restless existence. All of 
this is aided by Steven’s energetic 
portrayal of David, which jumps 
from 
desperate 
confusion 
to 

twitchy anxiety as he constantly 
tries to wrap his head around his 
reality. It also helps that Stevens 
is surrounded by a particularly 
strong cast, including Aubrey Plaza 
(“Parks and Recreation”) and Jean 
Smart (another “Fargo” alum).

Twisting and turning through 

its 90-minute premiere, “Legion” 
continuously 
throws 
new 

information and subversions at 
the audience, making the viewer 
constantly question what they’re 
seeingand 
whether 
it’s 
even 

happening at all. It rarely gives 
the audience any firm ground 
to anchor themselves to, as our 
perception and understanding of 
what is on screen is interrupted 
and reconsidered. The closest it 

seems to delivering something 
concrete comes in the form of 
David’s 
interview 
with 
The 

Interrogator (Hamish Linklater, 
“The Big Short”), which serves to 
deliver some necessary backstory. 
But even that reality is defined by 
shady motives and untold secrets 
as David struggles to unearth what 
his captors really want with him 
behind closed doors.

Hawley is most effective when 

he digs into the dimensions of his 
characters, thrusting them into 
situations that are far bigger and 
complicated than they can possibly 
imagine. 
Whether 
it’s 
brutal 

violence, 
unexpected 
disasters 

or 
unimaginable 

superhuman 
abilities, 
Hawley 

uses these events to 
truly test the metal 
of his characters. 
Some, like (“Fargo” 
’s) Lester Nygaard, 
react 
despicably. 

Others, like Scott 

Burroughs 
of 
Hawley’s 
novel 

“Before the Fall,” maintain their 
decency against all odds. And 
some act perplexingly, responding 
to irrational circumstances in 
increasingly unpredictable ways. 
And it’s only near the end of the 
premiere, when the pieces start to 
come together and the structure 
of David’s mind and the show itself 
begins to take hold that we’re truly 
able to ascertain much of the events 
we’ve seen and the characters 
that have taken part in them. If 
anything, “Legion” ’s premiere 
serves to firmly establish that the 
audience and characters won’t 
know what will happen next.

However, the effectiveness of 

“Legion” ’s form and dispersal of 
information comes with how much 
the viewer trusts the series to fulfill 
its potential. Like all other shows 
that rely on continually subverting 
audience expectations and turning 
reality on its head (just look at 
“Mr. Robot” or “Westworld”), 
the development of “Legion” and 
whether it can payoff, will truly 
determine its staying power.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

The purpose of Valentine’s Day 

never made much sense to me, but 
it’s on our national calendar for 
some reason — futile, I think — 
and that gives the day some sort 
of powerful validity. But love is 
nonetheless a concept that flows 
through many people’s minds on 
a daily basis. I exercise my own 
love by frequently listening to jazz, 
specifically Billie Holiday. It’s safe 
to say that Billie Holiday is and 
maybe always will be my valentine.

What many don’t know about 

Holiday though, is that her tender, 
romantic voice did not match her 
reality. Holiday grappled with 
severe relationships, drugs and 
abuse.

Before she became one of the 

most famous female jazz artists, 
Holiday moved to New York where 
she worked as a prostitute. Soon 
enough, she was discovered at 
night clubs and speakeasies in the 
1930s.

Holiday dated often, mostly 

musicians, 
but 
she 
married 

James Monroe in the early ’40s. 
This marriage led to her heavy 
involvement 
with 
drugs 
and 

alcohol.

What breaks my heart is that 

most 
won’t 
notice 
Holiday’s 

struggles, but only her voice. At 
least maybe not until they hear 
her Lady in Satin album, on which 
nearly every song is gloomy with 
sluggish melodies. Her smooth, but 
powerful voice strikes harmonic 
chords that don’t feel all that sad, 
regardless of her struggles. 

That dichotomy is unhappily 

fascinating. For a woman who 
sang much about romance and 
men — my favorites include “These 
Foolish Things (Remind Me Of 
You),” “I’ll Be Seeing You” and “My 
Man” — much of her music also 
includes songs about solitude and 
crushing romance.

Her music encompasses the 

raw aspects of this thing so called 
“love.” Even in the power of her 
voice, lyrics and song titles, Billie 
Holiday is a taste for anybody: the 
lonely one, the couples in love, the 
ones suffering from a bad break up, 
the one’s enjoying their single life.

She understands the truth of it 

— that love is really fucking hard 
and messy. But almost everyone 
craves it in some way.

Love is compiled of ridiculous 

facets, where one moment you’re 
in the “All of Me” stage, meeting 

someone and wanting them to love 
you for all you are; the next, your 
heart is broken, relating to “I’m 
a Fool to Want You.” Along the 
way, you might meet that special 
someone, where your lovey-dovey 
heart is feeling something like “I’ll 
Get By (As Long As I Have You).” 
You find yourself in this cycle 
of romantic positions, the ones 
represented by Holiday.

I do not know which is more 

intense: my unconditional love 
for her voice and her impact, or 
the tremendous heartbreak I feel 
for her and her battles.

If Billie Holiday were here, 

alive and well, I’d hear her 
stories, the good and the bad 
ones. In this fantasy, I’d make 
her a romantic, candlelit dinner, 
and we’d listen to jazz and 
discuss our favorites.

Mostly, I would thank her 

for being there for me, in all 
of my moments. The moments 
of romance, the moments of 
heartbreak, the moments of high 
stress or Friday-night relaxation. 
I would thank her for always 
being my therapy and my muse.

And 
Billie, 
even 
though 

you’re not here any longer, I’ll 
be looking at the moon this 
Valentine’s Day, seeing you. 

A very Happy Valentine’s 
Day to you, Billie Holiday

Wolverines thrive behind early offensive surge

With 11:17 left in the first quarter 

Saturday, the Michigan men’s 
lacrosse team faced a 1-0 deficit 
after Lafayette’s Eric Jospeh scored 
the first goal of the game.

What ensued next, however, 

would lay the foundation for a 
blowout victory and just the second 
2-0 start in the Wolverines’ young 
history.

Michigan 
would 
net 
six 

consecutive goals to finish out the 
first quarter, a scoring barrage that 
started with 9:10 minutes left in the 
frame. Lafayette would never lead 
again, and would struggle to keep 
pace with the Wolverines for the 
remainder of the game.

“We gave up the first goal the 

other day too, in our first game 
of the year,” said Michigan coach 
John Paul. “The first goal doesn’t 

matter so much. We’re more 
focused on closing out quarters, 
and that’s something I thought we 
did a pretty good job of today.”

The 6-0 run — over an eight-

minute span — was Michigan’s 
most dominant stretch of action 
Saturday. The final four goals of 
the quarter were 
scored between 
the 3:18 and 1:03 
minute 
marks, 

showing 
the 

Wolverines have 
the potential to 
score in a hurry 
with a cluster of 
goals.

“(The 
first 

quarter) 
really 

put us in a more 
comfortable 
position, knowing what we had to 
do for the rest of the game,” Paul 
said. 

Senior attacker Ian King led the 

scoring outburst, tying the game, 
1-1, with his first goal of the season. 
King would add two more soon 
thereafter, ending the first quarter 
with a hat trick. Rounding out the 
scoring stretch was a trio of goals 
scored by senior midfielder Mikie 

Schlosser, 
junior 

attacker Pat Tracy 
and 
sophomore 

attacker 
Rocco 

Sutherland.

“(King) 
was 

hurt all week. He 
actually 
didn’t 

practice all week,” 
Paul 
said. 
“We 

weren’t even sure 
we were going to 
have him today 
so (it’s) great to 

see that he could have that kind of 
performance coming off a week 
with no practice.

“I know he’s a little bit upset 

that he didn’t shoot very well last 
week. So it was important for him 
to get his shot going early, and he 
did.”

After giving up the opening 

goal, sophomore goalie Tommy 
Heidt held steady, as Michigan 
went on its run of unanswered 
goals to take the pressure off of the 
defense. The goal-scoring spree 
ensured that Heidt would have 
a comfortable lead to work with 
going into the second quarter, and 
eventually, the second half.

“Our 
offense 
was 
feeling 

it today,” Heidt said. “They 
were putting up a bunch of 
points. 
Having 
Rocco, 
Brent 

(Noseworthy), and Ian down on 
attack makes our jobs much easier 
on defense. Knowing that they’re 
going to be able to put the ball 
in the net is great to know when 
you’re playing on defense.”

Being able to score in bunches 

in short intervals of time could 
become a game-changing facet 
to Michigan’s identity. And if 
Saturday’s scoring avalanche is 
indicative of what’s to come, the 
Wolverines will have a potent 
offense to shoulder the load as the 
season wears on.

Despite allowing an early goal 

and starting off slow offensively, 
the Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
(2-0) dominated Lafayette (0-1) 
17-6 on Saturday. 

After 
going 

scoreless through 
the 
first 
six 

minutes of the 
quarter, 
the 

Wolverines found 
their 
footing 

and jumped to 
a 6-1 lead to end 
the first quarter, 
fueled by three 
goals from senior 
attackman 
Ian 

King.

King put a poor first game 

behind him, in which he was held 
scoreless, finishing with five goals 
Saturday. And in contrast to last 
year, when the Wolverines started 
the season 1-2, Michigan has 
started this season hot.

Michigan looked to start the 

second quarter better than it 
started the first, but its offense 
came out stagnant once again. 
Lafayette scored the first goal of 
the quarter, and the Wolverines 
struggled to find the back of the net 
for the first eight minutes. Much 
like the first quarter, though, once 
Michigan got the ball rolling it did 
not look back, leading Lafayette 
11-4 at halftime.

While the Wolverines faced 

difficulties at the start of those 
quarters, Michigan coach John 
Paul put an emphasis on finishing 
out quarters strong and keeping 
momentum.

“The first goal doesn’t matter 

so much,” Paul said. “We are more 
focused on closing out quarters, 
and that’s something I thought we 
did a pretty good job of today. You 
just keep confidence high and know 
that what we came in planning to 
do is going to work and it did.”

The Wolverines went on to 

continue their late-quarter pushes, 
closing out the last five minutes 
of the second frame, 4-1, the last 

three minutes of the third quarter, 
2-0, and the last five minutes of the 
fourth quarter, 3-1.

Dominating performance aside, 

every win has its caveats.

One 
such 
caveat 
for 
the 

Wolverines was penalties. Four of 
the Leopards’ six goals came on 

man-up chances, 
and 
Lafayette 

finished the game 
with eight man-
up opportunities. 
In total, Michigan 
had 
nine 
and 

half minutes of 
penalties, five of 
which 
came 
in 

the fourth quarter 
alone.

However, Paul 

did 
not 
seem 

worried.

“You’d always prefer to rein 

it in if you’re playing a little too 

physical than try and get the guys 
to play more physical, so we were 
certainly the more aggressive, 
physical team tonight,” Paul said. 
“I think what we have to learn from 
this is you have to get a sense of the 
way the game is being called and 
then adjust your game a little bit to 
how it’s being called, and that’s the 
lesson we are going to take away 
from this.”

Michigan will look to keep 

up the offensive firepower and 
physical play on defense while 
limiting penalties as the early part 
of its season progresses.

“This is by no means a perfect 

performance,” Paul said. “We have 
a lot to work on. We improved from 
last week to this week, which we 
needed to do, and now we have 
to improve before our next game 
Wednesday and that’s really the 
only focus now. We have to keep 
getting better.”

Michigan notches 
fourth-straight W

The No. 7 Michigan women’s 

gymnastics 
team 
left 
East 

Lansing on Saturday afternoon 
with a solid win by a score 
of 196.025 – 195.625, but the 
Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten, 6-2 
overall) 
weren’t 
satisfied. 

Normally, it may have been 
enough to defeat in-state rival 
Michigan 
State 
(0-5, 
3-5), 

but the Wolverines departed 
hungry for more. 

“We were hoping for a really 

good away score that was going 
to help our RQS (score),” said 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. 
“We came out with a win, 
which is great. We had some 
great individual performances. 
There were definitely a lot of 
positives.

“The ultimate goal was to 

come out with a mid-197 team 
score and we didn’t get that 
done.”

The 
Wolverines 
relied 

heavily 
on 
senior 
captain 

Nicole Artz, who nearly swept 
the meet. She took first place in 
three events, including vault, 
bars and floor.

Artz finished the meet with 

a 39.575, her best of 2017, and 
ultimately secured her fourth 
consecutive all-around title.

“She’s been amazing,” Plocki 

said. “She and Talia (Chiarelli) 
as a senior class have accounted 
for a very large percentage of 
our counting routines during 
the course of their careers here, 
so it’s been huge.”

Artz’s 9.900 on the bars 

proved useful during the first 
rotation after freshman Polina 
Shchennikova 
and 
junior 

Lauren Marinez both recorded 
falls, resulting in scores of 
9.200 and 8.500, respectively. 
Michigan trailed after the first 
event — an unfamiliar terrain 

for a squad often in the lead. 

And while Artz may be the 

clear leader of the Wolverines, 
the rest of her teammates take 
turns sharing the spotlight.

Sophomore Olivia Karas not 

only won the beam, scoring a 
9.900, but also competed on 
the bars for the first time this 
season after recovering from a 
wrist injury. Her debut didn’t 
disappoint. She finished only 
behind Artz in the event with a 
9.875.

One of the fresh faces on this 

year’s team is junior transfer 
Paige Zaziski. Not only has 
Zaziski 
brought 
the 
ability 

to compete in all events, but 
also she brings some extra 
excitement to the team. After 
she stuck the landing on her 
vault, she strutted back to her 
team snapping her fingers, a 
signature feature of her routine. 

If Zaziski’s reaction wasn’t 

enough to show that Michigan 
was having fun, the Wolverines 
moved to the floor event. Ranked 
fifth in the event, Michigan is 
known for its enthusiastic and 
fun routines.

Artz, Karas and sophomore 

Emma McLean shined in the 
event, earning the day’s top 
three scores. But Michigan 
had two gymnasts step out of 
bounds, which hurt the overall 
team score.

Artz’s continued excellence 

appears to lead toward the 
best season of her career, but 
her team may not necessarily 
be following suit. Michigan 
was happy to come away with 
the rivalry win, but it knows it 
needs to step up if it wants to 
accomplish its goals.

“This is the point in the 

season when we really have to 
be firing on all cylinders,” Plocki 
said. “The fact that we didn’t 
take advantage of a good away 
opportunity is disappointing.”

‘M’ falls to Wisconsin in final dual meet

The best was certainly saved 

for last on Sunday as No. 2 
freshman Logan Massa faced 
Wisconsin’s No. 3 Isaac Jordan 
in a highly-anticipated, top-five 
rematch after Massa beat Jordan 
earlier this season.

Massa gave up the early 

takedown but rallied back to 
take a 3-2 lead heading into the 
second period. From there, the 
165-pounder took over, delivering 
a quick takedown and ride-out in 
the second followed by a couple 
of late takedowns in the third to 
seal the victory, 9-7, in the final 
match of the afternoon. 

“I knew I just needed to keep 

my offense going the whole 
match,” Massa said. “Beating 
somebody on their home ground 
is always fun.” 

Added Michigan coach Joe 

McFarland: “I thought he did 
a nice job battling back after 
an early deficit in that match. 
That’s a great win against the 
number three ranked kid in the 
country.”

But Massa’s performance was 

not enough, as No. 14 Michigan 
(4-5 Big Ten, 8-6 overall) fell to 
No. 18 Wisconsin (5-5, 3-5), 19-18, 
in the last dual of the regular 
season for the Wolverines.

Michigan opened the scoring 

after redshirt freshman No. 8 
Myles Amine recorded a 10-2 
major 
decision 
win 
against 

Wisconsin’s Ryan Christensen 
in the 174-pound match. But the 
Wolverines’ lead was quickly 
relinquished as the Badgers 
strung together three wins in 
a row, knocking down redshirt 
junior Ernest Battaglia, redshirt 
freshman 
Jackson 
Striggow, 

and freshman Dan Perry in 
succession to go up 13-4.

In 
the 
125-pound 
match, 

redshirt senior Conor Youtsey 
took on Wisconsin’s Johnny 
Jimenez. After a low-scoring 
affair, the match headed into 
overtime tied at 1-1. Still tied 
after one sudden-death period, 

Youtsey and Jimenez battled 
into a second overtime period. 
Just when it looked like the 
match was headed toward a 
third overtime period, Youtsey 
notched a single-leg takedown 
with just two seconds remaining 
in the period to win 3-1.

“I put in a lot of hard work 

this week, getting into my leg 
attacks,” Youtsey said. “Going 
into those overtime matches, I 
kinda got a little bit of a feeling 
from NCAAs last year when 
I was capitalizing on a lot of 
overtime wins.”

“He did all the work in that 

match, he really did,” McFarland 
said. “It was good to see Conor 
stay tough.”

No. 7 Stevan Micic followed 

up Youtsey’s dramatic win with 
a dominant 20-5 technical fall 
victory over Eli Stickley in the 
133-pound match. Micic’s win 
helped 
narrow 
Wisconsin’s 

overall lead to just 13-12.

It was a dual characterized by 

runs, as the Badgers followed up 

Michigan’s two match win streak 
with back to back wins of their 
own. Wisconsin’s Cole Martin 
took down Sal Profaci in the 141-
pound match, and Andrew Crone 
edged out Malik Amine in the 
149-pound match.

In the 157-pound bout, ninth-

ranked senior Brian Murphy took 
on TJ Ruschell in the last regular 
season dual of his collegiate 
career. Murphy notched a four-
point cradle in the second period, 
but Ruschell kept it close until 
Murphy was able to manage a 
reversal late in the third period 
to capture the victory.

“It was a hard-fought dual, no 

question about it,” McFarland 
said. “I thought really, for the 
most part, we wrestled tough.”

Though Michigan was unable 

to win its last dual of the season, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
their 

work cut out for them heading 
into the Big Ten and NCAA 
Championships.

“You’ve got to constantly 

be on the attack in this sport, 

or 
somebody’s 
gonna 
take 

advantage of it,” McFarland said. 
“That’s something that we’ve got 
to continue to stress.”

Youtsey believes there is still 

much that can be improved 
upon in preparation for the 
postseason.

“There are a lot of adjustments 

that can be made in the next 
couple of weeks,” Youtsey said. 
“I think everybody can work in 
their specific areas to get their 
timing down right before Big 
Tens come around the corner.”

“You wanna be at your best 

(in the) postseason,” McFarland 
said. “… That’s when the best rise 
up a little bit and elevate their 
level of wrestling. Our guys need 
to do that.”

Massa, building on Youtsey’s 

sentiment, feels that the team is 
ready to step up to the challenge.

“We’ve got a young team, 

everybody’s working real hard, 
and we have high goals,” Massa 
said. “… We’re gonna give it 
everything we’ve got.”

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

Senior defenseman Nolan De Jong and the Michigan hockey team have suffered through a disappointing season.

A sad reality

N

olan De Jong stood 
outside the visitors’ 
locker room at 

Mariucci 
Arena. As the 
captain of 
the Michigan 
hockey team, 
the senior 
defenseman 
reflected 
on another 
loss, one of 
many in a 
frustrating 
and 
disappointing season. 

While clearly frustrated 

with the final outcome of 
two hard-fought matchups 
against then-No. 9 Minnesota, 
he still held some hope for 
the Wolverines’ upcoming 
games. Michigan would face 
rival Michigan State in two 
weeks, and De Jong believed 
a sweep against Spartans 
would provide some necessary 
momentum to rejuvenate the 
Wolverines’ season.

“I think beating State a 

couple times this next coming 
weekend will be huge for us,” 
De Jong said that night. “I 
think it’s going to come down 
to the hard work that we have 
to put in this week. We’re going 
to have to have intensity and 
we’re going to have to come out 
and believe we’re a team that 
can play a full 60 minutes.”

The Wolverines, though, 

didn’t sweep Michigan State. 
They didn’t have that intensity 
and they failed to play a full 60 
minutes. That first game saw 
Michigan drop a 4-0 shutout 
at Yost Ice Arena and while 
it earned a shootout victory 
in East Lansing the following 
day, it wasn’t the result the 
Wolverines needed.

Just last weekend, Michigan 

faced off once more against 
the Spartans, and like its 
first two meetings, struggled 
in its matchup with the Big 
Ten cellar-dwellers. It took 
a shootout goal from junior 
defenseman Sam Piazza to fend 
them off Friday night, while 

Saturday, the Wolverines failed 
to get any offense going in a 
5-1 loss.

The weekend served as 

a microcosm for a season 
Michigan will want to forget. 
One — usually close— game 
ending in a win and another 
matchup ending with a large 
loss. Against Ohio State the 
week before, Michigan fared 
similarly, winning on Friday 
night before losing a nail-biter 
the next day.

It was a loss that led 

Michigan coach Red Berenson 
to walk out after his postgame 
press conference. He discussed 
his disappointment with his 
team and left, neglecting to 
take any questions from the 
media.

But who could blame him? 

In such a tumultuous season 
that often leaves both coaches 
and players frustrated, it might 
even be justified.

Many expected the 

Wolverines to regress this 
season.

With the graduation of Steve 

Racine, Boo Nieves and Justin 
Selman and the expected 
departure of Kyle Connor 
and Zach Werenski, fans 
understood there would be 
some fallback. Still, they held 
out hope that JT Compher, 
Tyler Motte and Michael 
Downing would return.

But once everyone departed, 

the sad reality was that the 
team lacked experience and 
was filled with young, untested 
players.

It is difficult to quantify the 

exact effects that the return 
of Downing, Compher and 
Motte would bring, but it isn’t a 
stretch to say that at the least, 
their veteran presence would 
provide essential assistance to 
one of the youngest teams in 
the NCAA this season.

But given the sad reality of 

the present, fortunately for 
Michigan, they have some 
bright spots for the future.

Freshmen forwards Will 

Lockwood and Jake Slaker 
have gained valuable playing 
time in Michigan’s top six, 
while sophomore forward 
Cooper Marody — who missed 
the first half the season due to 
academic ineligibility — picked 
up where he left off from last 
season, tallying nine points in 
10 games.

In the crease, freshmen 

netminders Jack LaFontaine 
and Hayden Lavigne have also 
gained valuable experience 
— starting 73 percent of 
Michigan’s games this season, 
and will continue to battle for 
playing time in the upcoming 
years.

But these bright spots won’t 

see their full potential for at 
least another year.

And even this season, the 

sad reality is that it might even 
get worse for the Wolverines. 
This weekend, they travel 
to Madison to take on No. 
20 Wisconsin, followed by a 
series in Columbus against 
Ohio State before finishing the 
season with visits from No. 
5 Minnesota and No. 9 Penn 
State.

Michigan earned just two 

victories against these teams in 
its first six games and will not 
be the favorite in any of these 
upcoming matchups.

In a year marred with 

injuries, disappointment and a 
longing for the past, it is sadly 
fitting that Michigan’s best 
hope for a victory may already 
be in the rearview mirror.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan reflects on 
Sunday’s Pink Game

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has been playing 
historically well this season. The 
Wolverines’ 21-5 record is its best 
in program history up to this point 
of the season, and is only one win 
shy of tying another program 
record for most wins in a season.

Undoubtedly, the allure of 

Michigan’s NCAA Tournament 
prospects 
paired 
with 
the 

competition against elite teams 
in Division I have been at the 
forefront of the players’ minds 
as the end of the regular season 
draws near.

But even they realize that the 

physical and mental hardships 
of playing competitive basketball 
pale 
in 
comparison 
to 
the 

challenges 
that 
were 
shared 

with them this weekend during 
their annual Pink Game against 
Wisconsin, when they got to talk 
with breast cancer survivors prior 
to the matchup.

“It’s just so inspiring to see how 

positive they are,” said sophomore 
guard Nicole Munger. “They were 
laughing and having a great time. 
We think basketball’s hard, and 
it’s really just for fun. They’re 
fighting the real fight.”

The Pink Game is held each 

year as a part of the team’s 
philanthropic 
effort 
to 
raise 

breast cancer awareness and 
celebrate survivors of the disease. 
During the game, both teams don 
pink garments during warmups 
and the game — the Wolverines 
rocked pink and white Air Jordan 
XXXI basketball shoes. Even fans 
were involved, as a sea of pink 
shirts of all shades flooded Crisler 
Center to witness Michigan’s 
75-66 win.

“I remember just standing on 

the court and just looking up and 
seeing all the pink and thinking 
‘It’s bigger than Michigan,’ ” 
Munger said. “This is bigger than 

Michigan. This is bigger than us. 
It’s just really cool to being playing 
for something greater and bigger 
than yourself.”

When the Wolverines’ starting 

lineup 
was 
announced, 
the 

jumbotron — newly draped in 
pink 
background 
graphics 
— 

didn’t show the typical highlight 
reel accompanied with video 
snippets of the players flashing 
their handles in the locker room 
tunnel. Rather, six different breast 
cancer survivors were displayed 
on screen, reading off the names of 
the Michigan players and coaches.

And when the ball was finally 

tipped, the roar of the crowd and 
intensity of the game had a gusto 
unlike any of the Wolverines’ 
previous 
contests, 
especially 

during halftime, when breast 
cancer survivors of all ages were 
introduced and applauded on the 
court.

“I thought our crowd was 

outstanding and I thought we 
had an unbelievable atmosphere,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “The day and the things 
that we do to celebrate the breast 
cancer survivors is really special.”

The day before the game, when 

a handful of the survivors that 
were on the court spoke and ate 
dinner with the team, the message 
of gratefulness resonated the 
most, according to Barnes Arico.

“It’s so impactful how these 

women can come and share their 
stories with 18-to-22 year-old girls 
that think they’re invincible,” 
Barnes Arico said. “At this point 
in their lives, most of them haven’t 
really had any major obstacles or 
any hardship, and to hear from 
young women that just have had 
children to old women that it 
doesn’t discriminate.

“It can happen to anyone. 

And to really make sure to know 
your body and to have a great 
appreciation and great work ethic 
and a great attitude to everything 
in your life is important.”

Wolverines displaying well-rounded post play

BLOOMINGTON — Coming 

out of the halftime break with 
a 10-point lead, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team emerged 
from the tunnel shooting on 
their first possession, when 
senior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. found sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner for a pick-and-
pop shot.

The 
ball 
rimmed 
out 
as 

Wagner’s shot just missed the 
mark. 

On the Wolverines’ next time 

down the floor, sophomore guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rakhman 
found himself open, but his shot 
also rattled out.

Michigan missed its first six 

shots of the half before Wagner 
finally nailed a 3-pointer at the 
15:43 mark, ending an almost 
eight-minute scoring drought.

Playing in a hostile environment 

like Assembly Hall and going cold 
from the floor would doom the 
Wolverines earlier in the season 
— much like the game at South 
Carolina back in November.

But this time, it didn’t. Indiana 

only scored once during the 
drought, and Michigan’s first 
make of the half actually extended 
their halftime lead.

While the backcourt played a 

big role — Abdur-Rakhman played 
exceptional defense on Indiana 
star guard James Blackmon Jr. — it 
was the Wolverines’ post men that 
made the biggest impact.

Wagner 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
led the charge down in the post.

On both ends of the floor, the duo 

delivered a strong performance 
that saw them combine for 10 
points and 5 rebounds in the first 
half while completely shutting 
down Indiana’s other star, forward 
Thomas Bryant.

With 
Wagner 
and 
Wilson 

averaging double-digit points per 
game, there was no doubt that the 
two big men could put the ball in 
the bucket.

In the past few weeks, though, 

Michigan fans have witnessed the 
duo grow in two other areas: on 
the boards and on defense.

“Offensively, 
we 
didn’t 
do 

anything special,” Wagner said. 
“We just played our game. I know 
we’re hard to guard so we don’t 
need to change anything. … If 
we can just make the opponent 
feel uncomfortable, it’s such a big 
advantage.”

On the boards, Wagner reached 

a double-digit rebounding total, 
grabbing 10 on his way to the first 
double-double of his career.

It was an effort that had been 

coming for Wagner, and at Indiana 
on Sunday, all his work finally paid 
off.

While 
Wilson 
had 
just 

two rebounds Sunday, he still 
complemented Wagner with his 
defensive effort and offensive 
prowess.

On defense, Wagner was given 

a tough matchup with Bryant, who 
had been averaging 20.2 points in 
his past five games.

And after Bryant was held to 

just 13 points and one rebound in 
the two foes’ first matchup back in 
January, Michigan improved on 
that stat line, holding Indiana’s big 

man to just eight points on 3-for-8 
shooting.

The Wolverines put a double 

team 
on 
Bryant 
this 
time, 

effectively shutting him out and 
forcing him to find solace behind 
the perimeter, where he also 
wasn’t successful, missing four 
3-pointers.

“Moe 
and 
(redshirt 
junior 

forward Mark Donnal) have been 
doing a good job of fronting the 
post, not allowing them to get too 
many touches as they do in the 
post,” Wilson said. “We executed 
our game plan on defense as far as 
setting up the other one to trap the 
post guy and it worked out.”

Added Michigan coach John 

Beilein: “We didn’t want to give 
(Bryant) the same look every time. 
He’s too talented.”

While Wilson’s length was 

crucial for the double team to 
work, his help defense was just as 
vital.

Wilson slid over seamlessly to 

clog the lane all night, not allowing 
Indiana’s big men to operate.

“He’s doing a great job,” 

Wagner said. “He’s very good at 
using his arms. He’s so long and 
fast on his feet so it’s a really big 

advantage he has, and he uses it 
pretty well.”

Added Beilein: “The young 

man, for two years, has worked 
really had. The cerebral part of the 
game, he has the ability to do it, 
but he hasn’t had to be measured 
up and be accountable in games 
for it because it’s been scout team, 
it’s high school. It’s not like it is 
now, and he’s just embracing it all, 
trying to grow from it.

The growth of both Wilson and 

Wagner has been a whirlwind 
of a ride, including various ups 
and downs, ranging from the 
beginning of the season, when 
they were too aggressive on 
defense, committing too many 
fouls, to the beginning of Big 
Ten play, when they were afraid 
to be physical and their defense 
suffered. Now, though, the duo 
has found the balance to make 
them successful.

And as their play has started 

to turn for the better, so have 
Michigan’s results.

Now, their biggest challenge 

will be playing at that consistent 
level down the stretch, when 
the games will surely define 
Michigan’s season.
