Dean of Students Laura 

Blake Jones called out the 
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity 
at the University of Michi-
gan in a message to MLive 
published Dec. 17. Blake 
Jones said “several gen-
erations” took part in haz-
ing activities at the Theta 
chapter and the fraterni-
ty’s national headquarters 
turned a “blind eye” to haz-
ing.

On. Nov. 7, the University 

terminated the fraternity 
for hazing infractions with 
opportunity for recoloni-
zation after five calendar 
years. The IFC released a 
statement saying the Coun-
cil supported the Univer-
sity’s 
decision 
following 

the Student Organization 
Advancement and Recogni-
tion review conducted by 
the Greek Activities Review 
Panel.

Alpha Sigma Phi disasso-

ciated from the University 
and Interfraternity Coun-
cil in September, opting 
instead to join the newly 
formed Ann Arbor Inter-
fraternity 
Council. 
The 

fraternity cited new zon-
ing codes implemented by 
City Council as the reason 
for the change. According 
to the Office of Greek Life, 
fraternities must answer to 
the University regardless of 
governance.

“These sanctions result 

from a Hazing Response 
Team 
investigation 
that 

found 
substantial 
evi-

dence of dangerous recur-
ring practices within Alpha 
Sigma Phi’s new member 
process, including forced 
alcohol 
consumption 
and 

violent physical hazing,” the 
IFC wrote in the statement.

Nicole 
Banks, 
interim 

director of Greek Life and 
assistant dean of students, 
did not respond to The Dai-
ly’s request for comment. 
Kim Broekhuizen, associate 
director of the University’s 
Office of Public Affairs, 
said in an email that disaf-
filiation does not mean the 
chapter will not be held 
accountable.

“The 
general 
practice 

of a minimum suspension 

for five years allows time 
for the current students to 
matriculate from U-M and 
for the headquarters to put 
greater support in place for 
the chapter to operate effec-
tively following a closure 
for cause, to ensure that 
the same challenges do not 
recur,” Broekhuizen wrote. 
“The University investigat-
ed complaints against Alpha 
Sigma Phi that occurred 
while the chapter was an 
active member of the Inter-
fraternity Council. Alpha 
Sigma Phi’s intention to 
disaffiliate voluntarily did 
not absolve the chapter of 
accountability for its behav-
ior.”

The suspension from the 

IFC came before an MLive 
article published Dec. 5 
disclosing the results of a 

Freedom of Information Act 
request regarding the fra-
ternity’s closure. Text mes-
sages and emails between 
members of Alpha Sigma 
Phi described a “40-yard 
dash,” during which mem-
bers would allegedly run 
on pledges’ backs during 
the chapter’s “Hell Week.” 
The 
fraternity 
brothers 

described the event taking 
place and a student being 
injured.

“We had people run our 

backs during our hell week,” 
an Alpha Sigma Phi member 
wrote in a group message 
obtained through the FOIA 
request. “That doesn’t mean 
it’s a tradition or a (good) 
idea, but it means (it’s) 
become normalized by us.”

The 
University 
of 

Michigan has agreed to a 
$300,000 
settlement 
after 

former employee, Amy J. 
Wang, 
claimed 
she 
was 

wrongfully terminated by the 
school. Through an attorney, 
the University signed the 
settlement on Dec. 3, which 
was later released to MLive 
after a public records request.

According to the lawsuit, 

associate 
vice 
president 

of 
finance 
Nancy 
Hobbs, 

who was Wang’s boss, had 
asked Wang to “fraudulently 
misrepresent” the role of 
another employee to federal 
immigration officials. Wang’s 
complaint arose because the 
employee, who was working 
at the University through a 
North American Free Trade 
Agreement program allowing 
temporary work visas, was 
in a permanent managerial 
role despite restrictions in 
the 
program’s 
regulations 

prohibiting such a position.

Wang claimed when she 

refused to lie about the 
employee’s status she was

University Towers, a student 

apartment building on South 
Forest Avenue, was received a 
noncompliance notice from the 
city early this week threatening 
fines of more than $200 should 
they continue to fail to comply 
with municipal regulations.

The 
notice 
informed 

University Towers it had failed 
“to correct violations within 
the 
time 
limits 
specified” 

in addition to a “failure to 
obtain a current certificate or 
compliance with the city of 
Ann Arbor.” 

The warning invokes the 

City of Ann Arbor Housing 
Code, which reads, “No person 
shall lease or otherwise make 
a dwelling or rooming unit 
available for occupancy if a 
certificate of compliance is 
not in effect for the unit.” 
Ann Arbor’s Rental Housing 

Services 
office 
conducts 

inspections of residential units 
every 30 months and issues 
certificates of compliance for 
each property that passes the 
evaluation.

The notice posted on the 

doors to University Towers 
declared “all tenants have the 
right to put their rent money 
in escrow for all unregistered 
rental 
units 
and/or 
those 

posted as non-compliant” and 
listed Jan. 10 as the follow-up 
date for the violation. Failure 
to comply by that date could 
result in ticketing of University 
Towers.

When reached by phone, a 

receptionist from University 
Towers who did not identify 
herself said she had no comment 
on the matter at the time, 
but a manager may be able to 
comment at a later date. At the 
time of publication, The Daily 
was unable to reach a manager

Wednesday evening.

Democrats control every seat on the Board after sweeping November elections

Elected officials and local 

residents celebrated the swear-
ing in of the new class of county 
commissioners at the Washt-
enaw County Administration 
Building on Tuesday night. 
Four incumbents and four new 

members, all Democrats, of-
ficially assumed their roles on 
the Board of Commissioners, 
the first time the body has been 
entirely Democratic in its his-
tory. The county has the most 
Democratic representatives in 
the state of Michigan. 

Lawrence Kestenbaum, the 

county clerk and register of 
deeds for Washtenaw County, 
led the swearing-in ceremony. 
In a nod to the “blue wave” that 
swept the Board, Kestenbaum 
discussed the importance of 
considering the entire scope of 
beliefs within the county, which 
he said was the “most wonder-

ful constituency anyone can 
have.”

“The people around this ta-

ble do not represent the whole 
political scope of this county,” 
Kestenbaum said. “Reach out 
to those who you do not agree

#WeExist campaign 
calls for representation

Rackham 
Graduate 

School 
announced 
last 

month they will include 
Middle Eastern and North 
African identity options on 
their applications for Fall 
2019. The identity will fall 
under the white racial cat-
egory, with Middle Eastern 
and North African identi-
ties as further specifica-
tion, along with options 
for applicants to identify 
as European or other. The 
move follows requests from 
Arab students, staff and 
faculty for the University 
to officially recognize their 
identities in a campaign 
titled #WeExist.

The #WeExist campaign 

began two years ago when 
current and former stu-
dents Silan Fadlallah, Jad 
Elharake, 
Devin 
Jones, 

Ibtihal Makki and former 
Central Student Govern-
ment vice president Nadine 
Jawad had conversations 
about what the Diversi-
ty, Equity and Inclusion 


with and take them into 

consideration.”

District 9 commissioner 

Katie Scott, a nurse at the 
University of Michigan and 
vice president of the Michi-
gan 
Nurses 
Association, 

is new to the Board. She 
thanked the people who sup-
ported her throughout her 
first race.

“I am really honored to be 

here,” she said. “It was step-
ping out on a shaky limb for 
me to decide to run for this 
office, but I am so excited 

… My family was extremely 
supportive of this work as 
well as the Nurses Associa-
tion.”

Many of the commission-

ers echoed the sentiment. 
District 2 commissioner Sue 
Shink, who replaced Demo-
crat Michelle Deatrick, em-
phasized her commitment to 
serving residents uncondi-
tionally as an elected official.

“You deserve honesty and 

integrity,” Shink said. “I say 
that whether you are in my 
county or not, voted for me 
or not, or are a part of my po-
litical party or not.”

District 7 commissioner 

Andy LaBarre was elected 
to the Board again but re-
linquished his position as 
Chair, a role that District 8 
commissioner Jason Morgan 
will take on in his second 
term on the body.

Morgan said the commis-

sioners are in a unique posi-
tion to improve the lives of 
citizens.

“We have a unique ability 

to help people and improve 
people’s lives like no other 
part of government can,” 
Morgan said.

LaBarre emphasized the 
function of local govern-
ment in people’s day-
to-day lives and said he 
wanted to be a part of that 
process.

“It is my privilege and 

honor to work as the com-
missioner for District 7,” 
he said. “When you have 
a 
government 
shutting 

down on the federal level 
over a policy consider-
ation, it lets you know the 
importance of municipal 
and county government.”

Serving 
the 
commu-

nity was a common theme 
among the commission-
er’s’ remarks. District 6 
commissioner Ricky Jef-
ferson, 
an 
incumbent, 

said he intended to be a 
voice for all of his con-
stituents.

“I’m here to make sure 

that those children can 
have the resources that 
they 
need 
when 
they 

grow up: public health, 
mental health and educa-

tion system,” Jefferson said. 
“We are here to represent 
you with anything.”

Kestenbaum said the com-

missioners’ 
powers 
were 

unparalleled in Washtenaw 
County.

“As the County Board of 

Commissioners, no one else 
can do what you have the au-
thority to do,” he said, adding 
“Not all the important deci-
sions are made in Washing-
ton. Some are made in rooms 
like right here.”

After the swearing-in cer-

emony, the forum opened to 
questions from constituents 
in attendance.

Superior Township resi-

dent Jan Piert said she at-
tended the event because 
meeting with commissioners 
personally was imperative.

“I came here tonight be-

cause my friend said we 
needed to come to see who 
our county commissioners 
are to put a face to a name 
and to be able to hold them 
accountable,” Piert said.

I am really honored 

to be here.It was 
stepping out on a 
shaky limb for me 
to decide to run for 

this office.


The Office of Greek Life 

received the messages in an 
envelope 
during 
the 
2018 

winter semester and turned 
over the documents to the 
Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment last March. The case 
was closed because the AAPD 
were unable to verify the stu-
dent was injured during the 
fraternity pledging process 
and because his parents were 
uncooperative with investiga-
tors.

It was this “40-yard dash” 

which prompted Blake Jones’s 
statement to MLive, in which 
she questioned the nation-
al 
headquarters’ 
response 

to the “heinous behavior” 
and shared that hazing was 
found to have taken place 
at the chapter over multiple 
decades. 
Broekhuizen 
said 

the Fraternity & Sorority Life 
office supports Blake Jones’ 
statements.

Blake Jones went on to say 

Alpha Sigma Phi had an “utter 
lack of consideration for the 
well-being” of new members 
and the evidence “confirms” 
the 
fraternity 
leadership’s 

knowledge of hazing-related 
behavior.

The University and IFC 

agreed on sanctions against 
the chapter and remain com-
mitted to their original deci-
sion to close the chapter for 
five years. However, their 
position differs from that 
of the fraternity’s national 
headquarters and the AAIFC, 
which say the chapter is in 

good standing but is no longer 
affiliated with the University 
or IFC.

Gordy Heminger, president 

and chief executive officer of 
Alpha Sigma Phi, denied Blake 
Jones’s allegations of inaction 
from the national headquar-
ters in an email to The Daily. 
He said within 24 hours of 
being informed of the incident 
national members were in 
Ann Arbor to meet with chap-
ter members and investigate. 
He also said Alpha Sigma Phi 
national employees offered to 
work with the Office of Greek 
Life multiple times but weeks 
went by without a returned 
phone call.

Heminger 
said 
he 
sees 

these recent actions from 
the University as retaliation 
for the chapter’s disaffilia-
tion from the IFC, which he 
said was primarily because of 
the new zoning restrictions. 
Heminger said it wasn’t until 
six months after the national 
headquarters concluded its 
internal 
investigation 
and 

after its decision to leave 
the IFC when the University 
decided to hold a hearing, 
at which point the frater-
nity was no longer affiliated 
with the University and was 
advised by legal counsel not 
to participate.

“I would strongly encour-

age the University to hold 
its 
students 
accountable, 

much like Alpha Sigma Phi 
did, and not use a chapter of 
150+ members as a scapegoat 
or a mechanism to retaliate 
against because the chap-
ter voluntarily surrendered 
campus recognition because 

of 
zoning-related 
issues,” 

Heminger said. “We don’t dis-
pute that some former mem-
bers violated our Health and 
Safety policy, but we strongly 
dispute that the entire chap-
ter was involved or that the 
headquarters turned a blind 
eye to policy violations.”

Heminger noted the nation-

al headquarters’ investiga-
tion resulted in disciplinary 
action against certain mem-
bers and officers, a new pro-
tocol, a live-in staff member 
and other educational sanc-
tions and restrictions. He said 
the fraternity is still open to 
working with the University 
in the future and believes the 
mandatory changes have been 
well-received by the chapter.

According 
to 
Heminger, 

there were no health or safe-
ty violations at the chapter 
in the fall semester, which 
he sees as a sign of the effec-
tiveness of the national head-
quarters’ 
intervention. 
He 

also said there were no crimi-
nal or code of conduct charges 
against any members of the 

fraternity as a result of the 
police investigation.

He also said there will be 

no foreseeable changes in 
the chapter’s rush process or 
social calendar.

The disagreement between 

the 
University 
and 
Alpha 

Sigma Phi regarding the “40-
yard dash,” the proceeding 
investigations by the frater-
nity and University and the 
chapter’s suspension persists 
going into winter semester. 
While the national headquar-
ters says it and the chapter 
have been falsely character-
ized by the University and that 
the chapter remains operat-
ing, the University and the 
IFC uphold the sanction.

AAIFC President Michael 

Salciccioli, a Business junior, 
said in a statement to The 
Daily the chapter is still 
in good standing with the 
AAIFC. He said the coun-
cil took the actions of Alpha 
Sigma Phi national headquar-
ters into consideration and 
sees no problems for the chap-
ter moving forward under the 
AAIFC.

“Alpha Sigma Phi’s nation-

als already adjudicated the 
issue 
and 
suspended 
or 

expelled members who were 
involved in policy violations,” 
Salciccioli said. “Because of 
this and the fact that, to our 
knowledge, Alpha Sigma Phi 
has not violated any of our 
policies since becoming mem-
bers, the Ann Arbor Interfra-
ternity Council believes no 
further disciplinary action is 
needed.”

asked by Hobbs to resign 
with the threat of being 
fired if she did not comply. 
As a result, the subject was 
moved 
to 
a 
disciplinary 

review conference where 
Wang was fired for “failing 
to meet expectations” on 
July 13.

However, the University 

did not admit any liability 
in 
the 
settlement, 
and 

claimed they had corrected 
the 
employee’s 
visa 

issue 
without 
Wang’s 

involvement. 
University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 
responded 
to 
Wang’s 

allegations.

“The 
University 
of 

Michigan 
categorically 

denies the allegation that 
Wang was ever asked to lie,” 
Fitzgerald said in an email to 
The Daily. “The university 
also denies that Wang was 
a ‘whistleblower’ because 
the university, on its own, 
discovered the visa issues 
with another employee and 
took action to correct that 
situation 
independent 
of 

Wang.”

Hobbs retired from the 

University in late 2018.

The University offered 

Wang 
$219,000 
in 
lost 

wages and damages and 
$81,000 in legal fees. Wang 
agreed to never work for 
the University again and 
eliminated any new claims 
related to her termination. 

According to the agreement, 
the 
University 
also 

agreed to to let Wang’s 
record indicated she had 
voluntarily resigned.

“U-M 
agrees 
to 

characterize 
Wang’s 

termination as a resignation 
and expunge the personnel 
file 
of 
any 
documents 

reflecting she was fired.” 
The 
agreement 
goes 
on 

to state, “Wang and U-M 
agree that they will keep 
this Agreement confidential 
and will not disclose any 
information to any third 
party.”

Law 
professor 
J.J. 

Prescott, whose research 
interests 
include 

employment 
law 
and 

settlement, discussed the 
reasoning behind why the 
University may have chosen 
to agree to a settlement even 
though they did not claim 
any sort of liability for the 
situation.

“Parties 
often 
settle 

to reduce risk and lower 
costs” Prescott said. “Going 
to trail costs is expensive 
and 
time 
consuming, 

and there is always the 
uncertainty about the trial 
outcome. Even if you are 
very confident you will win, 
you can never be sure, so 
settlement can make sense 
for both parties.”

Wang and her lawyer from 

Gasiorek, Morgan, Greco, 
McCauley and Kotzian P.C. 
could not be reached for 
comment.

it’s for so I don’t know how 
it will affect me, but I do 
know that there has been no 
email or any communication 
in regards to this fine from 
management, which reflects 
on management as a whole,” 
he said. “As a resident, it would 
be nice to be on the same page 
as 
management 
and 
know 

all things that are going on 
with the apartment, but that 
definitely hasn’t been met.”

He said he was disappointed 

with 
the 
management 
of 

University Towers and was 
willing to move elsewhere.

“Living here kinda has its 

comment at a later date. At the 
time of publication, The Daily 
was unable to reach a manager 
for comment.

Business 
sophomore 

Cameron Zurawlow lives in 
University Towers. He said 
he had not heard much from 

his landlords in regards to the 
notice.

“I don’t really know what 

it’s for so I don’t know how 
it will affect me, but I do 
know that there has been no 
email or any communication 
in regards to this fine from 
management, which reflects 
on management as a whole,” 
he said. “As a resident, it would 
be nice to be on the same page 
as 
management 
and 
know 

all things that are going on 
with the apartment, but that 
definitely hasn’t been met.”

He said he was disappointed 

with 
the 
management 
of 

University Towers and was 
willing to move elsewhere.

“Living here kinda has its 

ups and downs,” he said. “So 
to be honest, I don’t think 
management does its best. 
When looking into UT last year 
as a freshman, I was promised 
all new furniture when I would 
move in my sophomore year. It 
turns out that when I showed 
up this year, I did not have new 
furniture in my apartment, and 
when I asked the front desk 
about the situation, they told 
me that they never said that 
and that I was not promised 
new 
furniture, 
which 
was 

completely wrong on their 
part.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Areesha 

Shahab also lives in University 
Towers and felt similarly to 

Zurawlow. She said she hoped 
the 
noncompliance 
notice 

would push management to 
improve their performance.

“I think the fine will cause 

many to rethink their stay in 
UTowers for future semesters 
and feel as though they can 
detest management more than 
they think since the city of Ann 
Arbor pointed out their flaws as 
well,” Shahab said.

Shahab 
said 
friends 
of 

hers who also rented units 
in University Towers were 
frustrated as well.

“Management isn’t all that 

great either,” Shahab said. 
“Some are very rude and 
unwelcoming. I’ve had a friend 
visit me in my apartment and 
get yelled at by a woman at 
the front desk for walking 
in the building, (which is) 
something that I hear other 
apartment buildings don’t yell 
at residents for as long as they 
don’t seem like strangers or 
pose a dangerous threat. I feel 
like by doing so, management is 
deterring future tenants.”

Howard Lazarus, Ann Arbor 

city 
administrator; 
David 

Kaiser, Ann Arbor city building 
inspector; and the city’s Rental 
Housing Services department 
did not respond to requests for 
comment.

strategic plan could mean 
for the Arab community. 
However, they soon real-
ized the Middle Eastern/
North African community 
was not included on any 
University 
of 
Michigan 

documents. Arab students 
marked themselves as white 
or other.

Kedra Ishop, vice provost 

for 
enrollment 
manage-

ment, oversees key offices 
within the University that 
supervise 
the 
collection 

and reporting of student 
data. Ishop said input from 
the Islamophobia Working 
Group, 
the 
organization 

in charge of the #WeExist 
campaign, provoked con-
versations with Rackham, 
which eventually led to an 
inclusion of Middle Eastern 
and North African identi-
ties.

“We made the change in 

large part in response to 
input from groups, such as 
the Islamophobia Working 
Group and student organi-
zations including CSG, that 
sought better reflection of 
MENA identities in Univer-
sity statistics,” Ishop wrote 
in an email interview with 
The Daily.

LSA junior Silan Fadlal-

lah, who is currently the 
group coordinator for the 
IWG, believes the inclusion 
of a ME/NA identity helps 
Arab 
students 
feel 
they 

belong.

“(Inclusion 
of 
ME/NA 

identity) 
is 
important 

because it gives an extreme-
ly large community a sense 
of belonging on campus,” 
Fadlallah wrote. “You con-
stantly see the “You belong 
here” signs on campus and, 
honestly, not even having 
a box that represents your 
racial group doesn’t give 
me that sense. How can 
you belong in a place that 
doesn’t even recognize your 
existence? And forget the 
feelings aspect, giving us a 
ME/NA checkbox opens the 
doors to opportunities with 
communities of color on 
campus, scholarships, etc.”

Jad Elharake, program 

lead at the Office of Diver-
sity, Equity, and Inclusion 
and the Office for Health 
Equity and Inclusion, said 
that the lack of data on the 
ME/NA community creates 
problems with identifying 
trends.

“The inability to collec-

tively identify ME/NA stu-
dents, faculty and staff is 
problematic for several rea-
sons that we’ve stated in the 
past when it comes to reten-
tion rates, academic dis-
parities, bias incidents, or 
really any assessment, espe-
cially DEI focused assess-
ments,” Elharake said.

While 
the 
University 

has started to account for 
Middle Eastern and North 
African identities, the U.S. 
Census does not. According 
to several people involved 
with adjusting University 
data, this has posed a logis-
tical challenge to including 
ME/NA identities on Uni-
versity documents. In order 
to adhere to federal report-
ing requirements, ME/NA 
identities fall underneath 
the white racial category 
in some official documents. 
Internal University docu-
ments, such as surveys and 
admissions 
applications, 

are the exception.

“We concluded that the 

application for admission 
is the most reasonable and 
efficient 
mechanism 
to 

collect extended race and 
ethnicity 
information,” 

Ishop wrote. “It is impor-
tant to understand that we 
remain subject to reporting 
requirements of the federal 
government, the state of 
Michigan, etc. that require 
our use of and alignment 
to the U.S. Census race and 
ethnicity 
categories 
for 

reports to them.”

However, many Arab stu-

dents feel including the 
Middle Eastern and North 
African identities under the 
white racial category is sim-
ply inaccurate to their lived 
experiences.

“The answer is extremely 

simple: 
Middle 
Eastern/

North 
Africans 
are 
not 

white,” Fadlallah said. “We 
are a beautifully diverse 
racial group with sever-
al different cultures and 
customs from the ME/NA 
region. If you go by the Cen-
sus, yes it says we are white, 
but try turning on the news 
and listening to them talk 
about any Arab and/or ME/
NA country because they 
exoticize and villainize the 
hell out of us. So why are we 
only considered white when 
it’s easier and more ben-
eficial, but considered to 
be the enemy or an “other” 
when society says so? We 
are ME/NA, not white, not 
other.”

Ethriam Brammer, assis-

tant dean and DEI imple-

mentation lead of Rackham 
Graduate School, identifies 
as an indigenous Latinx 
person and sees similari-
ties between the Latinx and 
Arab communities.

“The Latinx and Hispanic 

category is very similar in 
that you have racially Black 
identifying Latinx individ-
uals, or racially white iden-
tifying, or my own identity 
which is an indigenous or 
native 
Latinx 
person,” 

Brammer said. “The same 
kinds of combinations obvi-
ously exist with under ME/
NA individuals as well. Ide-
ally (ME/NA) would be its 
own separate ethnic identi-
fier.”

Brammer 
empathized 

with Middle Eastern and 
North 
African 
students 

who feel their identities are 
not accurately represented 
under a white racial cat-
egory.

“Where 
the 
complica-

tions come from and where 
the similarities end is now 
the Census Bureau has a 
Hispanic 
box,” 
Brammer 

said. “Since 2010 census, 
there’s basically a question 
of whether or not you’re 
Latinx or Hispanic, and 
then you move to racial 
identifiers. You can iden-
tify yourself as Latineq-
uis and African American 
and white, or like myself, 
Latinequis 
and 
native. 

However, that’s not possi-
ble with ME/NA right now. 
To consistently report our 
data, it has to be embedded 
with white unfortunately, 
because that’s the kind of 
federal standard for data 
reporting.”

Brammer 
believes 
the 

University’s 
divergence 

from federal racial catego-
ries displays leadership.

“I 
think 
the 
positive 

thing is that we’re showing 
leadership,” Brammer said. 
“This 
is 
important 
that 

Middle Eastern and North 
African individuals, be it 
staff, faculty or students, 
all have the opportunity 
to more accurately iden-
tify their own identity. But 
it’s not the standard way 
of doing it. It means that 
it’s a little bit more com-
plicated, and right now it’s 
still embedded within the 
white racial category, and 
we know that there’s a lot 
of complications that come 
with that.”

I would strongly 
encourage the 
University to 

hold its students 

accountable.

T

he most basic problem 
with 
thinking 
about 

candidates in terms of 

likability is that it prioritizes 
charisma over a candidate’s 
policies, 
temperament, 

experience, values and vision for 
the country. It creates a horse 
race version of politics in which 
everyone 
becomes 
a 
pundit 

choosing candidates based on 
who they think other people 
will like instead of based on 
who inspires them or presents 
the 
most 
thoughtful 
policy 

platforms. More importantly, 
likability is deeply gendered and 
racialized.

Likability 
is 
prejudicial, 

not preferential. No one just 
happens to like Barack Obama, 
Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders 
and Joe Biden more than they 
like 
Hillary 
Clinton, 
Nancy 

Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Gretchen 
Whitmer, Elizabeth Warren and 
Stacey Abrams. Likability is not 
innate, it is shaped by our social 
world. What we see influences 
what we value. What we have 
seen is 44 men and zero women 
elected president. Because we 
have never seen what one female 
president 
looks 
like, 
much 

less a broad and diverse array 
of them, it is much harder to 
imagine how a female president 
might govern. Our image of 
leadership is entirely defined by 
traditionally masculine traits, 
so we expect the command of 
a booming voice, the authority 
of broad shoulders and the 
power of a firm handshake. It’s 
no wonder that when a woman 
shows 
traditionally 
feminine 

leadership traits, threatening 
the system created to uphold 
male minority rule, she is cast 
off as “unlikeable.” 

Even in progressive circles, 

these issues persist. In 2016, 
countless men, the majority 
of which were “Bernie Bros,” 
insisted they would vote for a 
woman but just not that woman. 
That woman, who was arguably 
the most experienced candidate 
to ever run for president, who 
offered 
progressive 
policies, 

who would have been infinitely 
better than the current occupant 

of the White House. No, not that 
woman. As recently as November 
2018, 
I 
heard 
claims 
they 

“couldn’t define it” but “there is 
just something about her I don’t 
like.” What these men, and some 
women, fail to recognize is that 
who they do and do not consider 
likable is fundamentally tied 
to their own internalization 
of 
cultural 
messages 
about 

traditional gender roles for both 
men and women.

On the final day of 2018, 

Democratic 
Sen. 
Elizabeth 

Warren, D-Mass., announced 
her exploratory committee to 
run for the presidency in 2020. 
The former advisor of the 
Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, Harvard Law School 
professor 
and 
current 
U.S. 

senator tweeted a video focused 
on 
protecting 
the 
middle 

class from exploitation by the 
wealthy, placing emphasis on 
issues related to civil rights and 
equality. And it didn’t take long 
for the sexism to begin. The 
same day, Politico ran an article 
questioning how Warren can 
“avoid a Clinton redux—written 
off as too unlikable before her 
campaign gets off the ground.” 
The article goes on to cite a 
friend of Sen. Warren’s as saying 
“she is a warm and affectionate 
person” to contrast her to 
Hillary Clinton, who apparently 
must be frigid and domineering.

Hillary 
Clinton 
and 

Elizabeth 
Warren 
are 
very 

different politicians. They have 
very 
different 
backgrounds. 

Yes, both went to law school 
and both became U.S. senators, 
but this hardly distinguishes 
them as inseparable kin in 

Washington D.C. They have 
very different policies and policy 
priorities. Even the respective 
political environments for their 
presidential campaigns are very 
different. I wonder what they 
have in common.

Besides 
the 
misogynistic 

biases in the media, the truly sad 
thing this exposes is that while 
O’Rourke 
can 
be 
compared 

to Obama and Obama can be 
compared to John F. Kennedy, 
female candidates don’t have 
a 
template 
of 
a 
victorious 

presidential campaign to be 
compared to. Instead, they are 
lazily grouped into the same 
category reduced to their gender 
with little analysis of their 
unique qualifications and values.

Given the most generosity, 

what Politico is really asking is 
“how can Elizabeth Warren run 
for president as a woman while 
still being likable?” And they’re 
not wrong for asking it. They’re 
wrong for perpetuating a link 
between female candidates and 
being unlikeable. It is based on 
the same attitudes about women 
that lead to female leaders being 
described as “bossy,” “petty,” 
“not approachable,” “difficult,” 
“bitchy” and “self-interested,” 
as 
well 
as 
being 
assigned 

significantly 
more 
negative 

attributes 
than 
their 
male 

counterparts. Truth be told, any 
woman running for president 
will have to overcome the 
rampant sexism in this country. 
And if that woman is a person of 
color, she will have to overcome 
rampant racism as well.

And while these candidates 

and their campaign staff will, 
unfortunately, have to devise 
strategies to deal with sexism 
and racism, it is because of the 
relationship between likability 
and prejudice. Voters (and those 
involved in and who talk about 
politics) should avoid choosing 
the next president of the United 
States based on who they would 
like to have a beer with. We all 
know how that went last time.

Stop talking about female candidates’ likability

L

aying on the couch in 

my 
comfy 
pajamas, 

f lipping through the 

channels I come across an 

old classic: “Dirty Dancing.” 

I was ready to experience 

all of the passion between 

Baby and Johnny until I 

was rudely interrupted by 

a sequence of commercials 

for weight loss plans and 

products. I began to huff and 

puff as my cheeks turned red 

and f lipped off the screen 

in rage. My siblings sighed 

and 
ignored 
my 
visceral 

reaction to the commercials. 

Somehow, it slipped my mind 

that it was New Year’s Day, 

the beginning of a month-

long mental battle.

For 
most 
folks, 
New 

Year’s Day is the start of 

their new plan, lifestyle or 

diet. It’s when they make 

resolutions 
to 
be 
more 

active, read more books and 

eat cleaner. A fresh start 

from the holiday g uilt and 

shame of drinking too much 

and stuffing our faces too 

often. But recently, I have 

found it to be the beginning 

of a toxic time called “diet 

season.” This is when people 

are convinced by the diet 

industry 
that 
their 
lives 

will 
become 
better 
and 

they will be happier if they 

were physically smaller. So 

people ever year will spend 

their money to join groups, 

develop 
plans 
and 
get 

products to meet their goals 

of losing weight. This year, I 

will not be engaging in diet 

season but will be actively 

avoiding these messages and 

restrictions.

I’m sorry to share some 

sad and shocking news with 

everyone who is currently on 

their New Year’s diet: Diets 

do not work! I know it may 

be hard to hear this message 

after being told for years that 

the only way to reach health 

or happiness is by weight 

loss. But I’m going to repeat 

myself and spread the truth 

— diets do not work. People 

often 
regain 
the 
weight 

and negatively impact their 

metabolism. We have been 

fed a false message that our 

weight equals our health, 

which is not a holistic view 

of health. So, why are diets so 

commonly recommended and 

why do we keep restricting 

ourselves from food to reach 

this goal? I think weight loss 

companies want us to believe 

that we can lose the weight 

for good and are willing to 

take our money even if it 

hurts our mental health and 

well-being.

I have been trying to 

restrict the quantity and the 

quality of my food ever since I 

received messages from the 

world that my size was too 

big. In third grade, I was 

your average chubby kid who 

loved 
drinking 
chocolate 

milk, eating chicken fingers 

and some damn good fries. 

After visiting a nutritionist, 

I was told that I should be 

writing 
down 
everything 

I ate in order to learn my 

eating patterns and habits so 

I could become a healthier 

eater. But instead of learning 

about 
eating 
nutritious 

foods that could fuel my 

body, I began an incredibly 

unhealthy relationship with 

food and my body.

In middle school, I created 

my own carb-less diet where 

I kept track of my weigh-ins 

in a journal (it was pretty 

upsetting to find in my closet 

recently). In high school, I 

began paying for my diets 

on 
both 
Weight 
Watchers 

and Jenny Craig. During the 

period in my life in which I 

tracked everything I ate, I 

could not stop thinking about 

food 
throughout 
the 
day. 

Throughout the four years, 

my weight would f luctuate 

up and down and I blamed 

myself for my inability to be 

disciplined. And eventually, 

in college, I was over diets 

but had a new “ethical” vegan 

lifestyle that would finally 

make me healthy. But I ended 

up fueling intense cravings 

and 
categorizing 
certain 

foods as healthy and others 

as bad or evil.

This past fall, I stopped 

being a vegan and finally 

allowed myself to start eating 

eggs 
and 
dairy 
products. 

When people asked why I 

quit veganism, I would blame 

myself and say I didn’t have 

the willpower. All I could 

think about was eating my 

old favorites like a bagel and 

cream cheese or feta bread. It 

was not until the end of this 

past semester, in my Intro to 

Body Studies seminar, when I 

learned about the difference 

between 
eating 
disorders 

and 
disordered 
eating. 
It 

was then that I realized my 

veganism was just another 

way of restricting myself. 

Oftentimes, eating disorders 

can 
be 
easily 
categorized 

based 
on 
people’s 
day-

to-do lives and diets. But 

disordered 
eating 
is 
not 

always clear to diagnose but 

can still affect one’s day to 

day life.

So, now that I realized my 

poor relationship with food 

comes from years of diets 

and labeling food as good 

and bad, I’m not restricting 

myself from my cravings. I 

have actually begun listening 

to my body to find out when 

I’m hungry and what I want to 

eat. It’s not easy. Sometimes 

I find myself wanting to be 

restrictive and don’t listen 

to the signals my body is 

trying to tell my brain, and 

I’ll overeat or be too afraid 

to 
start. 
But 
I’m 
finally 

learning my natural signals 

of hunger and fullness. I’m 

not listening to what a diet 

plan says or trying to mimic 

the portions those around 

me 
are 
consuming. 
I’m 

trying to eat foods that are 

rich, nutritious, fatty, leaf y, 

greasy, sweet and fuel my 

body.

If you are still looking 

for a New Year’s resolution, 

perhaps make it to read a new 

book, 
particularly 
“Body 

Positive Power” by Megan 

Jayne Crabbe. She helped 

me change the way I think 

about food and my body. I’m 

not here to tell you how to 

feel or what you should be 

putting in your body. But 

by sharing my experiences, 

I 
hope 
those 
who 
have 

similar 
relationships 
with 

food 
know 
they 
are 
not 

alone. I’m sharing my food 

journey, not for sympathy 

or to brag that I’ve got it 

fig ured it out ( because I 

haven’t and I’m constantly 

learning new things about 

myself ), but to inform you 

to ignore the messages from 

the diet industry this year 

about what you should do 

to your body. Instead, listen 

to 
yourself 
and 
unpack 

whatever 
relationship 
you 

have with food when you 

are ready. Let’s be kind to 

ourselves and recognize that 

challenging diet season is not 

easy.

I

t’s a conversation we’ve 
all had with a friend. 
When asked their opinion 

on something political, they 
get really quiet and bashfully 
utter the standard reply, “Oh, 
I don’t follow the news,” 
sheepishly replying that it’s 
“boring,” “depressing,” “doesn’t 
affect me,” “doesn’t matter,” or 
something along those lines. 
They may push the question 
on someone who does have 
strong political views, leaving 
us to wonder, “If our fellow 
University of Michigan students 
don’t 
consider 
themselves 

politically invested, what hope 
does the rest of society have?” 
And why do so many people 
not think of politics as a part of 
their daily lives that is worth 
their time?

Don’t get me wrong, I always 

appreciate someone who has 
the courage to say they aren’t 
educated enough to speak on 
a topic, especially something 
as complicated as politics. So 
many people in this society 
give their opinions on issues 
they have no real knowledge 
on, only making them sound 
ignorant. 
However, 
so 
few 

people are actually educated on 
politics that ignorant opinions 
are what rise to the surface of 
these conversations. That leads 
to another big issue: ignorant 
voters.

Ignorant 
voters 
are 
a 

threat to society, and they’re 
everywhere. A lot of people 
who don’t keep up with politics 
may do nothing to rectify 
this 
when 
elections 
come 

around because they don’t 
believe their vote matters, 
so they don’t want to waste 
time researching. But when a 

good portion of voters all 

feel this way, it starts to make 
a big difference. This can 
lead to a major part of the 
population making uniformed 
electoral decisions, or simply 
not voting at all, greatly 
decreasing the accountability 
of the government. That’s 
how we end up with people 

complaining about the person 
they elected to office; if they 
had done their research in the 
first place, we might not have 
had this problem.

According 
to 
the 
Pew 

Research Center, ten percent 
of Americans above 18 are 
“politically 
disengaged”: 

they’re 
not 
registered 
to 

vote, they don’t contribute 
to campaigns and they don’t 
follow government and public 
affairs. Ten percent may not 
seem like a lot but that’s about 
32,570,000 American adults. 
32,570,000 people who don’t 
care what goes on in their 
own country. It should startle 
us that there are 32,570,000 
potential voters who, if they 
even decide to vote, could 
be 
uninformed, 
which 
is 

hazardous to democracy.

So here’s why you should 

care about American news and 
politics: You live here. Yes, 
keeping up on the news can 
be boring and/or depressing. 
Yes, American politics has 
kind of turned into a joke. 
And yes, the constant flow 
of unsavory information can 
be overwhelming. But it is 
your duty to be an informed 
citizen in the country you live 
in. Whether you like it or not, 
politics are everywhere. It’s 
not some easily disregardable 
school subject like calculus or 
chemistry (sorry engineers), 
or just a topic you can avoid 
at the dinner table. Politics 
are constantly present. The 
people who are elected the 
laws that are passed, and 
the actions that are taken 

affects your everyday life 
dramatically.

Not caring about politics is 

a kind of privilege — one that 
comes from being in a position 
granted by race, gender or 
class that allows you to feel 
like politics do not affect 
you. Maybe what happens 
to the public school systems 
doesn’t affect you directly. 
You’re not in school anymore 
and you don’t have kids in the 
school system, but it affects 
the people around you, and 
therefore society as a whole. 
As 
Elizabeth 
Broadbent 

writes in her own work, what 
Secretary of Education Betsy 
DeVos does to the school 
system doesn’t affect her kids 
because 
she 
homeschools 

them. But as an American 
citizen, she recognizes that 
it is her responsibility to care 
about politics, so she still spent 
time calling senators about 
schooling 
issues. 
Everyone 

benefits from a better school 
system, even if those benefits 
don’t seem direct or apparent. 
Therefore, issues that don’t 
seem to affect you personally 
can still influence your life, 
because they could affect the 
people around you.

If you want to be truly 

invested 
in 
our 
country, 

then pretend the state of 
our country is like a good 
friend, one whose life you 
are a part of and you check 
in on them every day to see 
how they’re doing. Listen to a 
podcast, read an article, talk 
to your friends or even take a 
political science class. Spend 
10 minutes a day catching 
up on what’s new with your 
country. Just do something, 
anything, to educate yourself 
on the world around you. It 
doesn’t take that much effort. 
But it will make you a more 
informed and active citizen, 
ready to create the country 
you want to live in.

Thursday January 10, 2019 — 5A

It was New Year’s Eve and 
Reece Hughes was playing 
video games with his friends. 
The sophomore was prepared 
for a night of some relaxed fun 
coming off of what had been a 
particularly grueling winter 
break of training.
Then around 9:30, Hughes’ 
phone buzzed and displayed 
an 
incoming 
call 
from 
Michigan coach Sean Bormet. 
Bormet informed his young 
wrestler that he would be 
traveling with the team on 
their west coast trip to cap off 
the break and that he would be 
wrestling — although he’d be 
doing it two weight classes up. 
Hughes, typically wrestling at 
the 165-pound weight class, 
would be filling in for an 
injured Jelani Embree, one of 
Hughes’ closest friends.
When it came time for 
his match on Jan. 3, Hughes 
stepped onto the mat with 
a game plan and nothing to 
lose and shocked everybody 
in attendance with a third 
period pin, highlighting a 33-8 
victory for the Wolverines 
(4-0 overall, 1-0 Big Ten) over 
Oregon State (1-3).
All the more remarkable, 
Hughes 
faced 
a 
nearly 
identical situation just a year 
earlier. When Michigan faced 
off against the Beavers in the 
Joe Wells Classic last season, 
Hughes stepped up a weight 
class and filled in for the 
then-injured 
Logan 
Massa 
to secure another surprise 
victory. 
Hughes 
showed 
everybody what it means to 
be a team player, embracing 
any opportunity to wrestle for 
the Wolverines, even if that 
means his record might take 
a hit.
In the end, despite the 
weight 
difference, 
it 
was 
Hughes’ 
preparation 
and 
training that led to the victory.
“Reece’s 
been 
training 
incredibly hard the last six 
to eight weeks,” Bormet said. 

“He’s always trained hard, 
but there’s been a noticeable 
amount of increased intensity 
in his training, and I’m seeing 
it daily.
“He’s a gamer. He competes 
hard, he sets a hard pace, he’s 
good in all three positions, 
and everybody’s excited to see 
him get his hand raised.”
Hughes knew he would have 
to approach things differently 
if he were to tack some points 
on the board for his team. In 
response, Hughes schemed 
with Bormet to keep the pace 
and movement high and tire 
out his opponent heading into 
the third period.
The plan worked like a 
charm. Hughes began the 
third in the down position, 
struggled to get to the edge 
of the mat with his opponent, 
Myles Terry, still draped over 
his back, then waited for 
Terry to make a mistake. After 
rolling around a bit on the 
edge of the mat, Hughes made 
his move, catching Terry’s leg 
and using his hips to thrust 
the wrestler onto his back for 
the bout-sealing fall.
“This 
was 
one 
of 
the 
matches where I didn’t have 
anything to lose, and that’s 
why I feel like I wrestled a 
better match at the end of the 
day,” Hughes said. “I went out 
there with, ‘Just go out there 
and give it your all.’ That’s 
what a few of the coaches 
came up to me and mentioned 
before the match. As long as 
you go out there and give it 

your all, we’re gonna be happy 
with your performance.”
Another 
highlight 
for 
the Wolverines came from 
freshman Mason Parris, who 
pulled off an enormous upset 
against the top-ranked Amar 
Dhesi in a near-dominant 11-4 
decision.
After 
finding 
success 
wrestling unattached to start 
out the season, Parris and the 
Michigan coaching staff were 
faced with a tough decision 
— 
redshirt 
their 
prized 
freshman or let him compete.
When match time rolled 
around, 
Bormet 
and 
Co. 
decided to unleash the beast, 
setting Parris free onto the 
collegiate 
wrestling 
scene. 
Parris responded in kind, 
handily beating D-I’s No. 1 
heavyweight.
“When 
you 
have 
a 
conversation 
with 
Mason, 
you could just see in his eyes 
he wants to compete and 
he’s up for the challenge,” 
Bormet said. “He’s excited 
about competing, he loves to 
compete. That’s why these 
guys want to go wrestle in 
college, and that was a great 
opportunity for him tonight, 
and he was excited about it.”
Added Parris: “It was a 
great feeling. It definitely 
boosted my confidence a lot 
just to compete with Michigan 
across my chest and compete 
for the team with my friends 
and stuff, so it was a really 
good experience for me.”
With a key freshman set 

to take on the gauntlet of Big 
Ten wrestling and a deep 
bench ready to wrestle up 
for the sake of the team, the 
Wolverines are poised for a 
dramatic season.

Slow to progress, Michigan’s offense looks for something that’s not there

Recall the first game of the 
season, a shock that came to 
many when the then-No. 4 
Michigan hockey team fell to 
unranked Vermont.
What was anticipated to be 
a relatively easy game ended 
in a loss that showed holes in 
both the Wolverines defense 
and offense.
“I 
thought 
we 
weren’t 
ready to play tonight, we 
weren’t really ready to play,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson after the loss to the 
Catamounts. “We came in 
today with the mindset that it 
was going to be easy and that 
we were going to come out and 
score 10 goals on them.
“Anytime 
you have that 
mindset, 
we 
got 
behind 
early and dug 
ourselves 
a 
hole. We clawed 
back a little bit. 
We did a lot 
of really good 
things, we just 
couldn’t score. 
Some 
nights 
they don’t go in, so you can’t 
give up four goals anywhere, at 
home, on the road, anywhere, 
and expect to win. You can 
check the stats, you gotta keep 
it to about two goals or under 
to have a chance. You give up 
four, you’re asking for trouble.”
Now think back to Tuesday’s 
4-2 loss to visiting Merrimack. 
The Wolverines (7-8-6 overall, 
3-4-4 Big Ten) fell into an 
early deficit in a game they 
figured to win and struggled 
to score goals while allowing 
four on the defensive end.
The Vermont game was the 
first of the season. Merrimack 
was 
the 
23rd. 
The 
same 
problems that occurred then, 
as Pearson noted Tuesday, are 
still occurring now. Only back 
then, it took the goaltender 

48 saves to stop the Michigan 
offense, whereas Tuesday, it 
took 36.
So as the season progresses, 
a 
supposed 
non-issue 
is 
becoming more apparent as a 
critical weakness for the team 
— scoring.
Pearson 
always 
believed 
the offense would grow as 
the team grew. After all, 
at the start of the season, 
new linemates were getting 
acquainted with one another, 
and younger players were 
learning the system. Pearson’s 
expectation has always been 
the same.
“The goal scoring will come, 
the goal scoring will come,” 
Pearson said after Michigan’s 
exhibition game Oct. 7. “If 
you’re forced to have to score 
five, 
it 
gets 
difficult. If you 
give 
up 
four 
goals, 
it 
gets 
tough to score 
five.”
And 
yet, 
against 
Merrimack, the 
team 
allowed 
four goals. And 
as predicted, it’s 
tough to score 
five, especially when a team 
is clawing back from behind. 
Against the 52nd-ranked team 
according to Pairwise, the 
Wolverines could only muster 
two goals, ones that required 
full effort just to get a good 
look.
The two came from junior 
forwards 
Jake 
Slaker 
and 
Adam Winborg. Slaker, who 
managed to get a step on his 
defender, hit a well-placed 
shot over the goaltender’s 
shoulder. 
Winborg 
fought 
for positioning for his goal, 
redirecting a slapshot from the 
blue line.
But these plays were never 
the issue. It’s the unsuccessful 
ones 
— 
despite 
all 
the 
opportunities created — that 
raise questions. How can the 

Wolverines, second in the 
nation for shots on goal and 
third in the nation for total 
shots, struggle to score so 
much?
Moments in the Merrimack 
game offer explanations as to 
why.
The first three minutes of 
the game were well played 
by the offense. Seven shots 
on goal, plenty of dangerous 
scoring opportunities were 
present. However, the team 
grew 
stagnant 
following 
its early barrage of shots, 
and more so after Michigan 
conceded a goal.
Even after it gained a power 
play off of a hooking penalty, 
the offense struggled to get 
anything going. The first 40 
seconds were spent attempting 
to enter the offensive zone, 
and quick clears by Merrimack 
made it more problematic for 
the Wolverines to get their 

power play going.
After 
the 
team 
finally 
pushed the puck into the zone, 
junior forward Will Lockwood 
received 
the 
puck at the blue 
line. Faced with 
pressure 
from 
defenders, 
he 
instinctively 
swung the puck 
out across the 
line to where 
another player 
was 
supposed 
to be to keep the 
offensive 
push 
alive. Only no one was there, 
and instead, the Warriors stole 
the puck during Michigan’s 
man advantage.
The power play ended with 
no shots on goal.
“We’re looking for a little 
bit too much offense playing 
— when you’re playing Notre 
Dame you know it’s Notre 

Dame and you know they’re 
a tough team,” Slaker said, 
alluding to the 4-2 outdoor win 
over the Irish last Saturday. 
“Coming in, we 
just didn’t play 
good 
enough 
early. 
That 
caught us, we 
went down, and 
we 
ended 
up 
chasing the rest 
of the game.”
The problem 
early was that 
Michigan 
was 
looking 
for 
something that wasn’t there. 
Passes that went aimlessly into 
the other team’s possession, 
rebounds that went untouched 
on 
the 
goalie’s 
stick-side 
and plays that would have 
benefitted from an extra pass 
were all issues exploited by 
the other team’s defense.
“That’s 
the 
difference, 

pucks all around the net, and 
we can’t convert,” Pearson 
said. “It’s more of the same for 
us.
“If you have it even around 
the net — and we missed the 
net a lot — they blocked a lot 
of shots, but we missed the 
net a lot. Over the net, wide on 
greater scoring opportunities. 
We’re not a gifted team as far 
as scoring goes. We have to 
really work for our goals.”
The realization of the team’s 
inability to score goals is the 
first step to fixing both sides 
of the puck. The offense can’t 
score five goals on any given 
day, and as Pearson hinted, a 
defense can’t expect that and 
give up four goals.
“It’s hard to play from 
behind, and we keep finding 
ourselves in that situation,” 
Slaker said. “It’s costing us 
games, and it’s starting to get 
frustrating.”

Hughes steps up, Parris upsets in dominant ‘M’ win over Oregon State


6A — Thursday, January 10, 2019

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

With a target on their backs, Wolverines travel to Champaign

On 
Thursday 
night 
in 
Champaign, Michigan will play 
in the most important game of 
Illinois’ season.
The Illini, for all intents 
and purposes, are already out 
of contention for the NCAA 
Tournament with a 4-11 record. 
Already, they’re more or less out 
of Big Ten contention as well, 
having dropped their first four 
games of league play. Currently, 
Illinois is ranked 106th in the 
country, per KenPom, and the 
schedule isn’t about to get easier.
But there’s still this: a chance 
to knock off the No. 2 team in the 
country and give the Wolverines 
their first loss. As Michigan 
approaches a program-record 
win streak to start the season, 
a target has, inevitably, taken 
shape on its back.
Six years ago, the Wolverines 
found themselves in the same 
spot — at 15-0 with Big Ten play 
ramping up. They loved every 
minute of it.
“It’s way more fun (to be 
the villain),” Spike Albrecht, a 
freshman guard in 2013, said in 
a phone interview. “Because you 
know you’re the one everyone’s 
going 
after. 
You’re 
getting 
everyone’s best shot. And just 
a normal day when you go into 
someone’s home arena, it might 
not be really bumping or super-
packed. But you know when 
you’re coming in, it’s going to be 
sold out.”
Michigan knew then and 
it knows now that it won’t 
finish 
undefeated. 
When 
sophomore Jordan Poole was 
asked about the possibility after 
Sunday’s win over Indiana, he 
demurred, saying the goal was 
an undefeated record at home. 
When coach John Beilein was 
asked about it Wednesday, he 
turned to the spokesperson 
beside him.
“There’s only one team that’s 
been undefeated in a long, long 
time and that’s almost 50 years, 

I think. Right?”
The coach was told: 1976 
(Indiana).
“So do the math. … 43 years, 
we just found out. May not 
happen again.”
That realism, of course, won’t 
make the Wolverines a smaller 
target. It also won’t lessen the 
sting of an eventual loss.
When that day 
came in 2013, it 
was Ohio State 
that delivered the 
blow — jumping 
out to a double-
digit lead early 
and 
hanging 
on 
when 
Trey 
Burke’s 
attempt 
at a buzzer-beater 
rimmed out. It 
was a splash of 
reality for a team 
with an unlimited ceiling.
“They were up like 30-6,” 
Albrecht said, “and I was like, 
‘Well shit, I guess we’re not as 
good as we thought.’ ”
With that realization, though, 
came a quiet sigh of relief.
“It’s like, ‘OK, it’s a great time 
to grow now. A great time to 
learn.’ You don’t always learn 
as much from winning,” Beilein 
told The Daily. “You learn more 
from losing. So when you have a 
loss, you embrace it and say, ‘OK, 
now we got a chance to be good.’ 
”
Added Albrecht: “It’s kind 
of — I don’t want to say it’s 
necessarily like, ‘OK, glad we 
got that first loss out of the way.’ 
Because you never want to lose. 
But it was kind of a reality check, 
and I think the coaches almost 
enjoyed it. Because they could 
come back and be like, ‘Alright, 
now we can get these guys off 
their high horse.’
“Because I’m sure if you’re a 
college kid, you’re 18 to 22 years 
old, you’re on top of the world 
right now. You think you’re hot 
shit. A first loss can be a little 
bit of a humbling experience but 
sometimes needed.”
This team isn’t the 2013 team, 

of course. Every player from then 
is long gone with the program’s 
identity having shifted from one 
that can go tit-for-tat scoring 
the ball to a top-ranked defense 
guided by the hand of assistant 
coach Luke Yaklich and the voice 
of junior guard Zavier Simpson.
These players haven’t been 
here in the literal sense — at 
this time a year 
ago, 
making 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament 
still 
hung 
in 
the balance of 
every 
game. 
But 
they’ve 
played in games 
of far greater 
magnitude than 
a Thursday in 
Champaign.
Final 
Fours 
and 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
championships — that’s the 
experience this team brings. 

Save 
for 
freshman 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis, every rotation player 
has been on a big stage with 
the world watching. More than 
cold, hard logic, that will inform 
Michigan’s 
response 
to 
an 
inevitable loss, as it has informed 
its response to every win.
“I think they’ve seen the 
example 
that 
Muhammad(-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman), Duncan 
(Robinson) and 
Moe 
(Wagner) 
and 
Jaaron 
(Simmons) 
set with that,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“They’ve 
seen, 
‘We won a big 
game. So what? 
We got bigger 
goals.’ 
And 
I 
think we all see 
that. Cause we 
had a lot of big 
wins and it just didn’t change 
practice at all. Same guys the 

next day.
“So that’s, I think, what’s 
resonating with (Jon) Teske. 
(Charles) 
Matthews 
already 
knew it, Zavier already knew it. 
(Isaiah) Livers has seen it now. 
(Jordan Poole) has seen it now. 
Austin Davis. The extent of 
who’s back — the whole idea is 
now, Iggy and the other guys to 
say, ‘Yeah, this is the real deal. 
Every day, we 
get a win. That’s 
all it is is a win.’ 
Doesn’t 
mean 
anything 
until 
we play the next 
game and then 
we got to go do it 
again, do it again, 
do it again.”
When 
each 
game you play is 
the other team’s 
most important, 
that’s the only choice in front of 
you.

Behind Enemy Lines: The Daily sits down with Illinois’ guard Aaron Jordan

On Thursday, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team (15-0 
overall, 4-0 Big Ten) will hit 
the road for the first time in 
over a month when it travels to 
Champaign to play Illinois (4-11, 
0-4).
The Illini are 
one of two teams 
winless 
in 
Big 
Ten 
play, 
but 
their 
strength 
of 
schedule 
ranks 
fifth 
in 
the 
country, 
according 
to 
KenPom. 
They 
have already faced 
non-conference 
powers Gonzaga and Iowa State, 
as well as Nebraska, Ohio State 
and Indiana in the conference. 

Things don’t project to be any 
easier for Illinois against the 
second-ranked team in the 
country. But the Illini under 
coach Brad Underwood are best 
known for their unique defense 
that is designed to put pressure 
on teams by forcing turnovers. 
That, combined with the fact 
that the Illini 
are 
playing 
in their home 
arena, ensures 
the Wolverines 
will 
have 
to 
work for a win.
Illinois 
senior 
guard 
Aaron 
Jordan 
isn’t the most 
heralded player 
on the team, 
but he is the most veteran of 
a starting lineup composed of 
two four-star freshmen and a 

sophomore. The Daily sat down 
with Jordan at Big Ten Media 
Day in October.
This 
interview 
has 
been 
edited for clarity and length.
TMD: How did you pick your 
number?
AJ: That’s actually funny 
but 23 is actually my second-
favorite number. 
My 
favorite 
number is eight 
but 
you 
can’t 
wear 
eight 
in 
college (college 
players can only 
use numbers 0-5 
on their jerseys) 
and 
I 
kinda 
just picked it in 
high school and 
then 
actually 
when I first got to college I told 
one of my best friends, my old 
teammate, that I was gonna 

change it. He threatened me 
and said, “If you change your 
number we’ll have problems, I 
won’t be your friend anymore.” 
So I stayed with it. Not really 
much of a story behind it, I don’t 
know, it’s just something I sorta 
gravitated towards.
TMD: Why is 23 your second-
favorite number?
AJ: 
Because 
I used to play 
soccer 
and 
then my soccer 
number 
was 
eight and my dad 
used to always 
scream 
“Go 
number 
eight!” 
and 
so 
that 
kinda, early on 
I played soccer 
more, so then I really embraced 
that number.
TMD: Why did you switch 

from soccer to basketball?
AJ: Basketball became, I 
started basketball around, I 
started travel basketball — so 
we actually go to a lot of places 
— in seventh grade, so it was 
just a really, it was a group of 
guys that were very close that 
loved basketball and so when 
I was able to be around that, 
something just clicked, and I 
said, “Hey, this is something I 
wanna do for the long run.” So I 
stayed with it.
TMD: What’s your favorite 
place you’ve ever traveled to?
AJ: It would have to be 
California. Anaheim. During 
AAU we went on a trip. We went 
to Philly for about a week and 
did a camp and then the team 
flew in and we had a basketball 
tournament. 
And 
then 
we 
came back to Illinois for a few 
days and then we flew out to 

California, played out there, 
then we drove to Vegas. So that 
was very much a road trip. In 
California, we were able to go on 
the boardwalk, go on the beach, 
it was very chill out there, good 
weather, sunny, good food, 
In-N-Out. I love that. If I go 
out west, I’ll probably eat it for 
breakfast, lunch and dinner.
TMD: What’s your favorite 
weather?
AJ: Fall. Definitely fall. You 
can put on a hoodie, put on 
sweatpants. I mean, that’s the 
go-to outfit right there. 
TMD: What’s your favorite 
restaurant near the University 
of Illinois?
AJ: Oishi. It’s a hibachi 
steakhouse. I love hibachi. Early 
on when our scholarship checks 
used to drop we always used to 
go, “Okay, hibachi, let’s go.”
TMD: What’s your favorite 
order there?
AJ: Last time I had steak 
and shrimp, but that was the 
first time I got steak in a while. 
Usually I get chicken and 
shrimp. But overall, truthfully, I 
like going there, I load up on the 
sushi. I’m a big sushi guy.
TMD: What’s been your 
favorite off-the-court moment 
in college?
AJ: Probably the trip overseas 
my freshman year. That was 
amazing. That was the first time 
going out of the country. Maybe 
second. But just being over there 
and experiencing it with those 
guys, 
that’s 
something 
you 
remember forever. 
TMD: Where did you go?
AJ: I believe we went to 
Germany and then we went to 
Paris, saw the Eiffel Tower, I 
think that was it. There were a 
lot of other places but you go to 
so many cities and just enjoy the 
moment for so much that you 
kind of forget it.
TMD: Do you play Fortnite as 
a team?
AJ: A lot of the guys on the 
team play Fortnite. I am not 
one of them, actually. I just sit 
and watch and I just try to hype 
everybody up. Yeah, I’m usually 
the one — they say I’m the 
worst player. I’m not the worst 
Fortnite player. I can get a kill 
or two.

1. El Mal Querer — 
Rosalía

“The Romance of Flamenca” 
is thought to be the first modern 
novel. Developed in the 13th 
century, it tells the story of a 
woman imprisoned by her jealous 
fiance — a twisted love story 
fraught with peril.
El Mal Querer, the second 
studio album from Los Angeles-
based but Catalonia-born singer 
Rosalía, is based on “Flamenca”, 
with each of the album’s 11 tracks 
serving as a chapter that details an 
increasingly doomed relationship. 
It begins with “MALAMENTE 
(Cap.1: Augiurio),” which Rosalía 
states serves as “a premonition 
— this moment when you know 
in the beginning of the story how 
it’s gonna end, but even then you 
go and do it.” Indeed, the song 
inspires a certain foreboding, with 
the lyrics of the chorus roughly 
translated to “Badly (that’s it) 
(like this) / Badly / Bad, so bad, 
so bad, so bad, so bad…. (look)!” 
The trailing piano underneath a 

steady, rhythmic clapping leads us 
into the first verse, and Rosalía’s 
teasingly abrupt lyricism spins 
over the production with grace; 
much like the woman within 
“Flamenca,” we are helpless to 
follow this narrative to its end, as 
hopeless as it may be. 
The devices Rosalía uses to tell 
El Mal Querer’s story are pieces 
pulled from all across the world. 
The bassline in “PIENSO EN TU 
MIRÁ (Cap.3: Celos)” was created 
in 
Spain. 
“BAGDAD 
(Cap.7: 
Liturgia)” was inspired when 
Rosalía went to a club in Baghdad. 
The title of “DI MI NOMBRE 
(Cap.8: 
Éxtasis)” 
was 
pulled 
straight from Destiny’s Child’s 
“Say my name, say my name.” This 
album stitches together sounds 
that have roots in flamenco’s 
expressive 
storytelling 
and 
organic dynamism yet still have 
contemporary pop’s global reach.
El Mal Querer is a masterpiece 
of expert production; within the 
canvas of each individual song, 
all of the sentiments behind 
“The 
Romance of Flamenca” — all the 
love and loss and betrayal — have 
been immortalized, universal and 
accessible to all.

2. Be The Cowboy — 
Mitski

Mitski’s album Be The Cowboy 
is, at its most basic description, 

a magnum opus. Although her 
previous records Bury Me At 
Makeout Creek and Puberty 2 
were critically acclaimed and 
works of art in their own right, 
nothing thrust the songwriter 
into the spotlight like this year’s 
spectacular collection of songs. 
Mitski’s command of the concept 
album is unparalleled in indie 
rock, and songs like “Nobody” 
and “Geyser” showed her skill for 
writing to these concepts (in this 
case, love letters to herself), with 
remarkable ease and ingenuity. 
She manages to marry the classic 
markers of rock, synth and even 
folk music together to create 
unique narratives of sound within 
every track, winding mazes of 
meaning and catchy hooks that 
lead a listener down paths full of 
love, longing and self-realization. 
Hearing Be The Cowboy is like 
opening someone’s diary and 
finding they have written a novel 
of their own thoughts Mitski takes 
her experiences and builds them 
into spectacular poetry, offering 
her 
audience 
a 
confessional 
through the prism of truly great 

music.

3. Dirty Computer 
— Janelle Monáe

For several years now, the 
public 
has 
followed 
Janelle 
Monáe often through the lens 
of her android alter-ego, Cindi 
Mayweather. In Metropolis, Cindi 
fell in love with a human and was 
chased through the streets of 
her city. In The ArchAndroid and 
The Electric Lady, she became a 
revolutionary messiah. But Dirty 
Computer is the fullest and most 
realized crystallization of Monáe’s 
aspirations yet, a dazzling project 
in which the artist sheds Cindi’s 
narrative but retains many of her 
futuristic 
preoccupations. 
Not 
so much a union of the past and 
the future as it is a convergence 
between them, Dirty Computer is 
constantly owning its homages 
— both to those who inspired the 
album, like Prince, and to a future 
that this album will no doubt help 
to inspire. This future is one of sex 
positivity and acceptance, one of 
dynamism and color and verve. 
This album marks the moment 
at which an already daring and 
independent 
icon, 
breaking 
barriers 
with 
her 
cybernetic 
characterizations and embrace 
of 
gender-nonconformity, 
has 
truly come into herself. We had 
come to feel like we knew Cindi 
Mayweather. Now, we are this 

much closer to feeling like we 
know Janelle Monáe.

OIL 
OF 
EVERY 
PEARL’S 
UN-INSIDES 
— 
SOPHIE

In 
a 
piece 
that 
almost 
functioned as a portion of my 
application to The Michigan 
Daily two and a half years ago, 
but which I wound up scrapping, 
I attempted to review SOPHIE’s 
first album (more accurately a 
compilation of singles). Released 
as 
Product, 
the 
collection 
introduced 
the 
world 
to 
SOPHIE’s characteristic sound. 
It’s sometimes grating, and often 
thinly layered, but with nuggets 
of irresistible melody and an 
odd, uncanny-valley allure. In 
one word: plastic.
After a two year break from 
releasing solo material — a break 
which saw her producing work 
by Vince Staples, MØ, Cashmere 

Cat and Charli XCX — SOPHIE 
returned with “It’s Okay To 
Cry,” whose video marked the 
first time her face had featured 
in her art. In June, as OIL OF 
EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES 
arrived, a newly vulnerable, 
more immediate version of 
SOPHIE emerged. She allowed 
us to see her, to begin to make 
guesses at who she is, to identify 
with her.
OIL, for its cinematic scope, 
possesses just as much violent 
thrashing as SOPHIE’s previous 
work, if not more. But there’s 
also an aquatic element to the 
album, and not just in the title 
of “Is It Cold In The Water?” 
but in its sub-bass and in the 
way tracks like “Infatuation” 
and “Pretending” wrap you 
up in them. Listen on a nice 
pair of headphones and you’re 
suddenly left feeling small, 
far from in control — there’s 
a senseless of “it’s safe here” 
and more of “it’s here here” or, 
maybe, “it’s real here.” The best 
you can do is cede control to 
the massiveness of it all. Until, 
of course, the synth swells that 
round out “Pretending” give 
way to the club-ready bounce 
of showstopper “Immaterial,” 
a track on which SOPHIE 
declares “I could be anything I 
want.”
And that’s what OIL is, 
ultimately: a declaration. One 
in which SOPHIE boldly claims 
her identity, while questioning 
the substance of identity itself. 

After “Immaterial” fades out, 
SOPHIE’s “Whole New World/
Pretend World” is upon us. I 
hope she shows us more of it.

5. DAYTONA — 
Pusha T

DAYTONA 
is, 
above 
all, 
incisive. The first of the Kanye 
West-produced, 
seven-track 
albums born out of the Wyoming 
sessions, Pusha T and Kanye 
came out the gates swinging. 
In direct contrast with Kanye’s 
indefatigable Twitter ramblings, 
DAYTONA is sharp and lean.
Pusha T doesn’t veer far from 
his traditional lyrical themes 
of selling drugs and being a 
generally threatening guy, but he 
doesn’t need to — on DAYTONA, 
he perfects the form. It all lies 
in his delivery. Ice-cold menace 
drips off of every syllable, and 
he makes you believe all that he 
claims.
The real genius of the album 
lies in the production, as Kanye’s 
skeletal 
sample-based 
beats 
are minimalistic masterpieces, 
stripping down the music to the 
very essence of hip-hop. “Come 
Back Baby” is this philosophy of 
production taken to its logical 
extreme: a relatively unaltered 
George Jackson sample gives 
way to a gaunt pattern of raw 
808s and drums, over which 
Pusha T discusses his love for 
the sale and distribution of 

cocaine.
The combination of Pusha T’s 
lyrical excellence and Kanye’s 
knack at production based around 
the sampling of simple melodic 
phrases is lethal and exhilarating, 
and the result is an album that 
feels like the thesis of Pusha T’s 
career.

6. Bark Your Head 
Off, Dog — Hop Along

Hop Along’s Bark Your Head 
Off, Dog is an insanely ambitious 
endeavor. Narrative, poetic and 
biblical in lyric and even more 
complex in composition, it’s truly 
unlike any other alternative record 
released in 2018. They’ve always 
been excellent and cherished 
songwriters, 
expertly 
layering 
rhythm and melody guitars, but 
with the introduction of complex 
string arrangements and deft 
tonal shifts — often within the 
course of a single song — Hop 
Along has produced a work of epic 
magnitude.
Their 
versatility 
is 
best 
showcased on fourth track “Not 
Abel,” 
opening 
with 
tender, 
rollicking folk before collapsing 
into uptempo rock ‘n’ roll. Every 
track is a thorough joy to listen 
to, as unexpected twists and 
turns constantly keep listeners 
on their toes, forcing them along 
the journey. In reference to Bob 
Dylan’s influence on their writing, 
lead singer and guitarist Frances 

Quinlan said in a Rolling Stone 
feature, “Fuck me. There’s no 
rules. I forgot. You make them up, 
and then you realize that you have 
to obliterate them again,” and Hop 
Along do this time and time again 
throughout the entirety of Bark 
Your Head Off, Dog. The past year 
was saturated with a lot of indie 
rock, and thankfully Hop Along 
decided to shatter the status quo 
by shattering all expectations.

7. Golden Hour — 
Kacey Musgraves

Golden Hour is a landmark work 
of pop-country; a well-crafted 
tribute to the sublime. Traditional 
country 
instrumentation 
and 
themes 
mingle 
freely 
with 
the 
psychedelic 
and 
subtly 
experimental, 
making 
Golden 
Hour 
as 
accessible 
as 
it 
is 
innovative.
The production on Golden Hour 
is notable not just for the lustrous 
glow infused throughout, but 
for its great use of negative space 
— a scorching electric guitar 
or beautiful fingerpicked banjo 
swells like radiant light into the 
emptiness for just a few seconds, 
as beautiful and fleeting as the 
namesake of the album. Kacey’s 
emotive voice is 24-karat Nashville 
gold, tastefully draped across the

1. “Immaterial” — 
SOPHIE

It is not an overstatement 
to say that “Immaterial” does 
more in its just-under-four 
minutes than any other song 
released in 2018. On the sur-
face, “Immaterial” is pure fun, a 
club-ready banger that leaves no 
stone unturned, sonically. The 
harsh synthetic pots-and-pans 
that 
characterize 
SOPHIE’s 
earlier work are almost con-
stant throughout, if subdued, 
but the song is also sleek and 
atmospheric. “Immaterial” is a 
masterclass in maximalist pop: 
It builds from nothing, adding 
layer after layer, and allows us 
to bask in the whole organized 
mess for a full chorus before 
peeling back to let the progres-
sion repeat.
After the second chorus, the 
sound is filtered down to nearly 
nothing. From that nothing, 
guest vocalist Cecile Believe’s 
voice rises. “I was just a lonely 
girl / In the eyes of my inner 
child,” she sings, as the song 
rebuilds around her, before pre-
senting the central revelation of 
OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-
INSIDES: “I could be anything 
I want.” The same declaration 
appears in the chorus, followed 
by “Anyhow, any place, any-
where, anyone / Any form, any 
shape, anyway / Anything, any-
thing I want,” confidently and 
plainly divorcing identity from 
physical form.
Given that, alongside OIL’s 
release in June, SOPHIE pub-
licly came out as a trans woman, 
“Immaterial” functions as the 
album’s central affirmation of 
her identity. But it feels reduc-
tive to point to SOPHIE’s com-
ing out as the sole impetus of 
OIL, or to try to use it as a prop 
to convince you, the reader, to 
listen, because “Immaterial” is 

deserves your attention for so 
many more reasons than that. 
As a final note, SOPHIE claimed 
back in July that she had three 
more albums coming out before 
the end of 2018. Fingers crossed 
that we’ll get them soon.

Writer

2. “Sicko Mode” — 
Travis Scott

It begins with a menacing 
advancement of synth. Waver-
ing tantalizingly in the dis-
tance, the notes signal the 
approach of something. The 
specifics of what is approaching 
aren’t clear but Drake is men-
tioning something about Louis 
belts and the beat is spiraling, 
faster and faster — anticipation 
growing by the second — until, 
abruptly, the beat switches, the 
song splinters apart and hun-
dreds of eager listeners collec-
tively lose their shit.
“Sicko Mode” is instantly 
recognizable. Whether you’re 
a fan of Travis Scott or not, 
you’ve heard this song: the 
Swae Lee chorus “Some- Some- 
Some- Someone said” bouncing 
off house party walls, the brief 
Luke sample from “I Wanna 
Rock” bleeding out from Ricks’s 
dance floor. Its power comes 
through its unexpectedness. 
Within an album that swims 
through a muted psychedelic 
haze, its sharp twists — from 
Drake to Travis to B.I.G. to the 
constantly shifting beat — slap 
you in the face.
“Sicko 
Mode” 
embodies 
everything Travis Scott was 
working toward since Owl Pha-
raoh, when his music always 
contained a desperate note of 
desire to not just dream about 
fame but to be consumed by 
it. Now, nearly five years later, 
ASTROWORLD 
is 
certified 

platinum, “Sicko Mode” con-
tinues to top charts and Travis 
Scott is not just dreaming any-
more.

3. 
“Shallow” 
— 
Lady 
Gaga 
and 
Bradley Cooper

Anyone who has seen the 
trailer for 2018’s box office 
hit “A Star is Born” knows the 
words to “Shallow” “I’m off 
the deep end / Watch as I dive 
in / I’ll never hit the ground!” 
Lady Gaga sings as her charac-
ter Ally, immediately lodging 
the song’s chorus into every 
viewer’s heart for weeks and 
even months to come. The 
song served as the first single 
for “A Star is Born”’s incred-
ible soundtrack, and set up the 
success and critical acclaim 
that both the album and movie 
received before and after its 
release. Even without the con-
text of the movie, “Shallow” is 
a heart-wrenching ballad that 
fuses folk with rock and pop to 
form one memorable expres-
sion of freedom. It’s a song that 
taps into the universal desire to 
crash through the things that 
hold one down to find some-
thing else in the world, and 
will likely remain a classic for 
years to come because of this. 
The music is fantastic, but the 
song’s message is even stronger 
it tells the listener that they can 
go deeper anytime they choose, 
and find something beautiful 
within the risks they take to 
break free.

1. Voting as an aesthetic

While a plethora of trends emerged on the runway 
in 2018, some of the most notable statements took 
the shape of a less wearable form. A year of political 
turmoil and tension, the push to vote became a major 
theme of this past year. With primary elections in Aug. 
and midterms in Nov., combined with an emphasis on 
change, voting became a sort of decorative accessory 
that was once so mundane and uninteresting.
Voting has and always will be fundamental and 
one of the most important parts of civil discourse, but 
2018 spun voting in such a way that it became shiny 
and new, a hip, cool aesthetic that extended beyond 
runways or clothes. The act of voting itself inspired a 
whole new wave of trends: ‘I’m Voting’ stickers were 
sold online and in stores, becoming a main focal point 
of laptops everywhere. Celebrities even used their 
fame to endorse this act through special merchandise 
and limited edition tees. With these items driving the 
aesthetic of voting, one thing in 2018 became very 
clear: to take the time to vote is to be on trend, showing 
it becoming all the more fundamental to being a 
legitimate trendsetter. A certain alliance formed with 
this aesthetic, between voting graphic tee wearers 
and sticker holders alike. Whether or not everyone 
who reps a ‘I’m Voting’ sticker or shirt actually voted 
is a debate within itself, but the aesthetic that evolved 
from the 2018 election scene is only the beginning for 
the development of an entire brand emphasizing that 

both the act of voting and showing political awareness 
are, in fact, high fashion.

— Margaret Sheridan, Style Beat Editor

2. Exploded versions of classic 
prints

Bold yet complementary shade ranges, classic prints 
reimagined and expanded upon, and plush textures 
played very nicely together this year. Whether it be 
fashion, expressing opinions or fighting for the things 
you care about, 2018 was not for the faint of heart: If 
you have something to say, say it! Words aren’t meant 
for mincing and they might best be backed up by a 
hardy cotton velvet, mohair or a blown-up woven 
houndstooth jacket, considering they all talk their 
walk and they were seen in nearly every fall runway 
show this year. Spring’s spliced double-jackets, 
leather inserts and drawstring necklines folded over 
into wildly proportioned faux furs and modernized 
classics taken to proportional and textural extremes. 
From the likes of household names like Balenciaga 
and Loewe to cult favorites like Engineered Garments, 
Neighborhood and A Kind of Guise, it felt as though 
classic silhouettes and prints had died and ascended 
to a retrofuturist heaven featuring droves upon droves 
of fuzz. A few outerwear highlights from the year 
were Demna Gvasalia’s interpretation of the double 
jacket at Balenciaga this spring, N.Hoolywood’s half 
leather, half super 120’s wool trench from their JFK 
inspired runway, Kapital Kountry’s oversized denim 
blazer with hand stitched smiley face patches along 
the arm and Craig Green’s brilliant employment of 
color blocking. This year marked both the expansion 
and deconstruction of classic styles across the board, 
creating a luxurious launching pad for designers 
moving forward into the new year.

3. Vibrant makeup

The unveiling of Meghan Markle’s wedding day 
tab may have revealed just how much can go into 
looking like you aren’t wearing anything at all, but 
2018 saw an explosion of beauty trends that served us 
the extravagant and the unexpected. YouTube MUAs 
and Instagram personalities are as prevalent as they 
have ever been and each artist’s path to carve out a 
creative niche for themselves has had the cumulative 
effect of ushering in increasingly vibrant, layered, 
multi-dimensional concepts that are encouraging the 
everyday beauty consumer to step out of their comfort 
zone and let cosmetics be a vehicle to realize personal 
fantasies. Unnaturally colored blush and eyebrow 
looks, forehead blush, luminous-vinyl textures (think 
face gloss and lacquered eye pigments), 3-D sticker 
appliqués and beyond have trickled into the routines 
of anyone possessing the gall to give these trends a 
try. It isn’t so much that any specific trend originated 
in 2018 or that anyone reinvented the wheel, but 
that makeup is on its way to becoming a creative 
space more concerned with creating new realities 
rather than heightening this one. Accounts like eve.
frsr, branalunan and sydn4sty have amassed sizable 
followings by doing just this, and the cosmetics market 
has responded with aplomb — independent companies 
(like blush tribe and claropsyche) seemingly crop up 
every day with palettes, pigments and accessories to 
meet ever expanding needs, while larger companies 

like Anastasia Beverly Hills and Tom Ford are 
launching new products and widening their shade 
ranges to accommodate demands that reach further 
and bolder than their current offerings. It’s the Wild 
West right now, and there has never been a better time 
to pick up a kabuki brush and some pressed powder 
and see what happens.

4. Champion’s evolution as a 
brand

It is safe to say that the brand, Champion, came 
up in 2018. As athleisure filled runways and the early 
2000s began making a comeback, Champion rose in 
popularity.
To provide a full analysis of Champion’s evolution 
as a brand, we must start from the very beginning. 
Champion’s simple, relaxed, clothing catered to the 
blank and oversized attire of the early 2000s and 
‘90s. Known for its creation of the reverse weave, the 
hooded sweatshirt, and the sports bra in the mid-
1990s, Champion was the epitome of activewear. The 
brand had become so prevalent that it was named 
the official outfitter of the NBA in 1980. It was not 
until 2000 that Champion was considered more than 
activewear, it became a keystone for the normcore 
aspect of early 2000s fashion.
Champion’s versatility can be seen in its comeback. 
It made its return by collaborating with well-known 
streetwear companies in 2017 such as Supreme and 
the French label, Vetements. Through each of these 
collaborations came distinct clothing, however, the 
Champion brand was undeviating. By 2018, Champion 
stood on its own as a fashion superpower. It no longer 
needed collabs to be attractive to customers; the classic 
blue, white and red logo was powerful enough for stars 
such a Kylie Jenner to sport.

Best style moments: 2018 
was as trendy as you think

1. 
SMTD’s 
“Angels 
in 
America: 
Millennium 
Approaches”

The Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning first 
installment of Tony Kushner’s epic tale about AIDS 
and homosexuality in the Reagan era, “Angels in 
America: Millennium Approaches,” was performed 
on the Arthur Miller stage earlier this year. Daniel 
Cantor, director and University professor, pieced 
together a talented ensemble of actors. Particularly 
unique to this version of “Angels in America: 
Millennium Approaches” was the angel suspended 
before the audience’s eyes in a vast array of colorful 
silks. It was easily one of the best theatrical 
performances I’ve ever seen. The commitment and 
passion coming from all involved was remarkable to 
witness.

2. MUSKET presents “In 
the Heights”

2018 has been a particularly dispiriting year 
for diversity. As a woman of color, it’s hard to face 
a world thriving with anti-immigrant sentiment. 
My heart reaches out not only to people of color, 
but to anyone who has been branded as different. 
Individuals with physical or mental disabilities, 
sexual assault victims and dreamers — those who 
face the consequences of their labels without having 
control over their experiences. Musicals like “In 
the Heights,” written by Quiara Alegría Hudes 
and composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, remind us 
that there’s still hope for those who feel silenced. 
MUSKET’s rendition of this inspiring story of 
Latinx life in Washington Heights, Manhattan was 
vibrant and attentive to the culture it embodied. 
The show was not only a celebration of diversity, 
but of life. Musicals like “In the Heights,” like all 
stories from different walks of life, deserve a seat at 
the table.

3. Literature vs. Traffic 
Installation

When the University Institute for the Humanities 
brought the “Literature vs. Traffic” installation 
to the streets of Ann Arbor on Oct. 23, it was an 
intervention for thousands of Ann Arbor students 
and residents. Ten thousand books lay splayed out 
on East Liberty St. illuminated by the sun by day and 
by thousands of gentle LED lights by night. These 
lights gave the books a preciousness that reminded 
everyone who came across the installation how 
near and dear books are, or at least once were, 
to our hearts. Crowds eagerly sifted through the 
books when the gates opened at 8 p.m. that night, 
some people even acting as if there was a piece of 
knowledge lying somewhere on that street that 
would complete them if they could just find it. 
Maybe putting ten thousand versions of any object 
on the street for free would have inspired the same 
reaction, but it seems here that the students and 
residents of Ann Arbor were driven by a thirst for 
new information rather than consumer instincts. 
Before coming to Ann Arbor, the installation was 
also set up in Madrid, Toronto, Melbourne and New 
York. Its arrival and success here speak volumes 
about Ann Arbor’s far-reaching influence on the 
humanities.

4. A Dramatic Reading of 
Arthur Miller’s “Death of a 
Salesman” with Alec Baldwin 
and U-M Theatre & Drama 
Department

For a brilliant reading of Arthur Miller’s iconic 
play “Death of a Salesman,” exceptional theatre 
students and professors from the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance were joined by award-winning 
actor Alec Baldwin on Saturday, Sept. 29 at the 
Power Center. Semi-staged and fully produced in 
both its intention and execution, the near four hour 
marathon of a performance remained engaging 
until the last lines. The play was as profoundly tragic 
and poignant as it was cathartic. The seamless 
coherence between Baldwin and SMTD’s actors 
created an electric synergy that did Arthur Miller 
(an SMTD grad himself), SMTD and Baldwin more 
than justice.

“An 
Evening 
with Audra McDonald: Songs 
from the American Musical 
Theater”

This past Nov., I was lucky enough to see 
the fantastic Audra McDonald perform at Hill 
Auditorium. Audra McDonald is a six-time Tony 
award winning singer and actress — a well-known 
and powerful presence on Broadway stages. 
McDonald was able to connect with the audience 
by telling stories through narration and song in a 
way unmatched by any other performer. I watched 
McDonald make the most overdone Soprano 
repertoire sound new to my ears by projecting her 
own story and perspective onto the song. I was 
awestruck; her singing voice seemed to be simply 
an extension to her speaking voice. That night, 
McDonald dazzled the hearts and minds of Ann 
Arbor.

6. Pasek and Paul Book Tour 
to Ann Arbor

When thinking about my favorite event of 2018, I 
am sent down a wistful lane of remembrance full of 
inspiring University productions, thrilling touring 
events and student pieces that moved me both to 
laughter and to tears. However, I have to think 
about the roots of all of this creative collaboration, 
exploration and celebration. Who paved the way? 
The answer lies in our many fantastically talented 
alumni, three of whom I had the pleasure of seeing 
live in Ann Arbor early in the fall semester of 
2018. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (writers of “Dear 
Evan Hansen”) and Darren Criss (“Glee”) all came 
together on the “Dear Evan Hansen” book tour on 
a cool Oct. Ann Arbor evening in Hill Auditorium. 
The trio sang, read from the novel and told stories 
of Michigan and beyond, reminiscing on their past 
while thinking of their creative futures. The event 
reminded me why I am so lucky to be here: a student 
pursuing creative arts with so many inspiring and 
creative people around me. Pasek, Paul and Criss 
— all incredibly successful arts in theatre and film 
— have paved the way for University alumni artists 
after them by providing an artistic community of 
alumni working in the real world. At the event, the 
trio invited their previous professors on stage to 
sing songs from “Dear Evan Hansen” with them and 
answer questions from audience members, inviting 
us to all be a part of the conversation surrounding 
their new novel and future projects. The event 
was thrilling and breathtaking, yet casual and laid 
back. The audience settled into the auditorium 
comfortably, inviting the trio of artists to take a 
stroll down memory lane.

7. SMTD’s “Porgy and Bess”

Year after year, some of the biggest names in folk 
travel to Michigan for the Ann Arbor Folk Festival. 
This year, for the festival’s fortieth anniversary, 
the acts were bigger than ever. From some of 
the biggest names in the genre like John Prine, 
to smaller, up-and-coming acts like Mountain 
Heart, there really was an act for everyone at the 
festival. For two nights, Ann Arbor’s historic Hill 
Auditorium transformed into a haven for music that 
celebrates the tradition of storytelling in America. 
Whether you are a walking folk encyclopedia or 
know absolutely nothing about the genre, the Ann 
Arbor Folk Festival is an Ann Arbor tradition that 
everyone should experience.

presents 
“Cold 
Blood”

I have seen some bizarre things within Ann 
Arbor’s art world, but the University Musical 
Society’s “Cold Blood” was by far the most absurd. 
Filmed live in the Power Center, the performance 
focused on hands. On stage, the audience could 
see the actors and cameras, but the real action was 
on the screen above which projected a close up of 
the actors’s hands. The show went through the 
death of seven different hands occurring in places 
like a drive-in theater or a frozen lake, deaths that 
could be both hilarious and mournfully tragic. The 
hands moved like people and embodied human 
characteristics in the most creative, minute ways. 
I felt as if I was in a hypnotic, dreamlike state as 
the narrative transitioned from story to story. The 
techniques used for lighting, shifting scenery and 
props were surprisingly brilliant. Many times I 
wondered, how did they do that with just a hand? 
“Cold Blood” stuck with me because death was 
portrayed in a way that was so hard hitting; I can 
still feel the sense of pleasant uncertainty and 
inevitably that I left with.

10. Orpheus Singers: “The 
Poet Speaks of Love”

The Orpheus Singers are a vocal ensemble at the 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance conducted by 
Dr. Eugene Rogers’s graduate studio, a remarkable 
group comprised of Master of Music and Doctor of 
Musical Arts choral conductors. With their haunting 
voices, The Orpheus Singers left a lasting mark on 
their audience during their second performance of 
the semester on Nov. 29. Both undergraduate and 
graduate students revived age-old songs and poems 
in beautiful sound. The group provided a prime 
example of how supporting one’s fellow students at 
the University can evoke a sense of pride and awe.

The TV beat has a problem: 2018 was a great 
year in television. On one hand, as the television 
addicts we claim ourselves to be, this “problem” 
has provided us with a myriad of excuses to avoid 
social contact and stay in. On the other hand, 
the consistent stream of quality television makes 
any effort to choose definitive favorites all the 
more difficult. The selection process itself was 
strenuous: on what criterion should we base our 
picks? Should we skew towards smart comedies, 
somber dramas, or meet somewhere in the middle 
with the wide range of dramedy hybrids on the 
market today? Should entertainment value be the 
main determinant or technical prowess? What 
role should cultural context and inclusion play? As 
best as we tried to pick shows that combined each 
of the above criteria, in trying to nail down an 

angle, it became very clear that no matter which 
shows we selected, and which order we placed the 
shows in, at the end of the day, it is subjective. So, 
if your favorite show does not end up making the 
cut, you still have pristine taste, champ!
Also, please consider the fact that this list was 
drafted before the Golden Globes; we do, indeed, 
have minds of our own.

1. 
“The 
Marvelous 
Mrs. 
Maisel” (Season Two)

After a pilot season that brought in two Golden 
Globes, four Emmys and an infinite amount of 
praise from critics, the cast and team of “The 
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” had a lot to live up to in 
the sophomore season of the Amazon Prime Video 
comedy. The show clearly did not disappoint. 
Rachel Brosnahan is a glowing, persistent light 
in gloomy world of cookie cutter comedies. Her 
magnificent performance is only enhanced by the 
equally impressive work of her costars, from the 
flawless comedic timing of Alex Borstein as Suzie, 
Maisel’s agent, to the love-to-hate-him role taken 
on by Michael Zegen as the star’s complicated 
ex(ish)-husband. Everything about “Maisel” is 
pleasing to watch: the saturated set design, the 
perfect soundtrack and the clever jokes woven 
into the show so well you might miss them. 
“Maisel” is so simply entertaining that it is easy to 
overlook the painstaking attention to detail that 
lies within the show. Once again, “The Marvelous 
Mrs. Maisel” has proved itself as the exemplar of a 
period comedy, highlighting the novel charm of a 
bygone era, but never failing to wryly critique the 
problems of it we have progressed from. One can 
only hope it will sustain its rule.

2. “Atlanta” (Season Two)

Donald Glover and Hiro Murai have developed 
a symbiotic partnership for the ages. The Lennon 
and McCartney of modern TV, they achieved the 
rare feat of following up a brilliant debut season 
of TV with another, surpassing the first in terms 
of boldness, innovation and emotional resonance. 
There are too many episodes in season two that 
made me completely re-evaluate how TV can or 
should be done, in a way that reminds me of the 
way I felt I first watched “Twin Peaks” hit its 
stride. Donald Glover’s creative genius is common 
enough knowledge that any further lauding would 
seem redundant. More underrated are the virtuosic 
performances of Lakeith Stanfield as Darius and 
Brian Tyree Henry as “Paper Boi,” with the latter 
giving a nuanced and heartbreaking portrayal of 
depression this season. “Atlanta” continued to 
hit the surreal notes it did so well in season one, 
including a stunning “revelation” about Drake 

and perhaps the best episode of TV this year, the 
horrifying “Teddy Perkins.” Although the titular 
city remains its central focus, Murai and Glover 
take us to a variety of locales within it, from a 
German festival to a state college frat party (which 
also produces one of the show’s most memorable 
and disturbing scenes set to D4L’s “Laffy Taffy”). 
All that’s left is to wait and see what this duo can 
accomplish next.

3. “Barry” (Season One)

Hired assassins have had a moment this past 
year, but our two favorites could hardly be any 
more different. Just as “Killing Eve”’s Villanelle 

is vivacious and disturbingly passionate about 
her job, the titular hitman in Bill Hader’s 
brilliant “Barry” is increasingly frustrated and 
disillusioned with his. He finds his true calling 
in an acting class directed by Gene Cousineau, 
played by Henry Winkler in one of his greatest 
performances. 
Like 
“Killing 
Eve,” 
“Barry” 
straddles the increasingly fine line between 
comedy and tragedy, and is anchored by Hader’s 
masterful portrayal of depression and his quest to 
climb out of it, all while his past life clings on.

— Sayan Ghosh, Assistant Arts Editor

4. “Killing Eve” (Season One)

You know what’s tired? Having the same debate 
every three months about whether or not James 
Bond can be played by a Black man. You know 
what’s wired? Scrapping the whole James Bond 
idea and allowing “Killing Eve” to replace it as the 
premiere spy story in pop culture. It is rare that 
a show can hook you from the first minute and 
then retain that chokehold grip on your attention 
for the remainder of the season, but “Killing Eve” 
does it. What makes the show so engaging is its 
usage of the parallel narrative arcs following both 
Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh, “Grey’s Anatomy”) and 
Villanelle (Jodie Comer, “My Mad Fat Diary”). The 
quickness with which the show intercuts between 
protagonists makes it difficult for audiences 
to figure out exactly who to place our support 
behind, which keeps us watching. The first season 
of “Killing Eve” is particularly exciting because 
of its boldness in daring to diverge away from 
genre conventions. At first glance, “Killing Eve” 
appears to be just another thriller-drama, devoid 
of all humor. But then moments of dark, off-kilter 
hilarity occur — like a character accidentally 
dying from spraying perfume (that really wasn’t 
perfume) and before you know it, you’ve devoured 
the entire season. 

— Ally Owens, Daily TV Editor

5. 
“Bojack 
Horseman” 
(Season Five)

The animated show about a goddamn self-
loathing horse man continues to produce the 
realest content on TV. Let the brilliant animal 
puns (seriously, how do they still come up with 
them) draw you in, but let the touching, intelligent 
portrayal of everything from addiction to loss 
to abuse keep you mesmerized. Every season, 
“Bojack” delivers episodes that push the envelope 
of what we can expect from the medium itself 
— from an entire episode under the sea with no 
dialogue, to Seasons 4’s magnum opus “Time’s 
Arrow,” which let us into the deteriorating mind 
and traumatic past of Bojack’s mother. This season, 

we received “Free Churro,” an entire episode 
delivered as a monologue before ending on a note 
so absurd it pretty much sums up Bojack’s entire 
relationship with his mother. “Bojack Horseman,” 
in all its brilliance, continues to set the standard 
for absurdist comedy (where else can you find a 
season-long arc about a sex robot gone rogue?) 
that has the capacity to make nuanced social 
commentary.

— Sayan Ghosh, Assistant Arts Editor

6. “Insecure” (Season Three)

Well, I wanted to simply use a photo of Issa 
Rae as my justification for this ranking. But, alas, 
this job requires me to write, so I will attempt 
to summarize (in under 10,000 words) why 
“Insecure” ranks amongst the best television of 
2018. While single-handedly transforming what it 
means to be a funny Black woman on television, 
this is not the sole reason why “Insecure” is 
great television. With each season, Rae and 
her team raise the bar of quality for the show — 
the writing continues to become snappier, the 
characters more layered, the cinematography all 
the more beautiful. However, I want to zero in on 
what season three has done in particular. Season 
three, in many ways, was a season of transition 
for the characters of “Insecure,” and while 
still continuing to provide enjoyable, hilarious, 
escapist television, it does an excellent job 
reflecting real changes twenty-somethings must 
endure. Through seeing the central characters 
surmount changes of great magnitude, “Insecure” 
remains one of the few shows on television in 
which all characters, central and secondary alike, 
have an element of depth and authenticity to them. 
During season three, particularly, characters like 
bougie Tiffany (Amanda Seales, “Blackish”) and 
brash Kelli (Natasha Rothwell, “Love Simon”), 
who were previously minor and underdeveloped, 
were given the chance to evolve before our eyes 
into fully fleshed out characters with a semblance 
of a life outside of their interactions with Issa.

— Ally Owens, Daily TV Editor

7. “GLOW” (Season Two)

Because the season one finale neatly concluded 
the season-long arc dedicated to seeing whether 
the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling could actually 
produce a successful television program, I 
wondered where the show could take the ragtag 
bunch in its sophomore effort. I was pleasantly 
surprised to see that everything enjoyable about 
the first season was reproduced and elevated 
in season two. One of the best things about the 
second season was the opportunity to learn 
more about the real women behind the theatrical 
wrestling personas. While in the first season, the 
central drama afflicting the diverse ensemble was 
their satirical acceptance of their stereotypical 
roles, in season two, viewers are able to see what 
lies beneath the surface. Most memorable was 
the episode following Tammé’s (Kia Stevens, 
“Total Nonstop Action Wrestling”) struggle 
to explain to her son how and why she deals 
with participating in minstrelsy for a paycheck. 
Although we definitely saw more of the diverse 
ensemble cast than in season one, “GLOW”’s 
problematic tendency to centralize only its white 
characters remains. Being one of the best shows 
of 2018 does not mean it comes without room for 
improvement. Hopefully, in the forthcoming third 
season, we will be able to see the same heart and 
eclectic humor, but with better storylines for the 
characters of color. However, “GLOW” makes up 
for any shortcomings by finally providing viewers 
an episode completely dedicated to showcasing 
the show-within-the show in all its spectacular 
’80s-ness.

— Ally Owens, Daily TV Editor

8. “The Good Place”

As a fan primarily of comedies, I have never 
switched one on for the purpose of an intellectual 
challenge. That is, until I discovered “The Good 
Place.” From the beautiful mind of Michael 
Schur, a man that gave us both “Brooklyn Nine-
Nine” and “Parks and Recreation,” “The Good 
Place” is a comedy about death, decisions and 
doing the right thing (sounds hilarious, right?). 
It is the harmonious marriage of philosophy and 
comedy, two subjects that do not meet as often as 
they should. While watching “The Good Place,” 
you’ll find yourself chuckling along with loveable 
demon, Michael, played by certified silver fox Ted 
Danson and then moments later be captivated by 
a discussion of Kant with the dreamy Professor 
Chidi 
Anagonye 
(William 
Jackson 
Harper, 
“Patterson”). Yes, the entire cast is hot. “The Good 
Place” will challenge both your mind and your 
ability to pick up on some incredible niche jokes. 
And if the Golden Globes won’t say it, I will: this is 
one of the best shows of the year.

— Samantha Della Fera, Senior Arts Editor

9. “Queer Eye” (Season Two)

2018 was a long year. It’s hard to imagine that 
between Kylie Jenner giving birth, an Olympic 
games, a World Cup and Mark Zuckerberg taking 
over the government that not one, but two, 
seasons of the “Queer Eye” reboot were released. 
But, it’s true, “Queer Eye” triumphantly returned 
this year, and oh, was it wonderful. “Queer Eye” 
is the embodiment of joy neatly packaged in a 
makeover show. No matter how you may feel 
about individual members of the Fab Five (sorry, 
Antoni), the show undoubtedly acted as a force of 
positivity against a horrifyingly bleak year. While 
polarized political parties rip each other to shreds 
in Washington and across the country, “Queer 
Eye” reflected a different possibility: Georgia 
conservatives and queer men cuddled up on a 
couch shouting “Yas, Queen!” together. At its core, 
“Queer Eye” is a show about hope: Hope that some 

of our differences are not irreconcilable, and hope 
that it is possible to truly fall in love with yourself.

— Samantha Della Fera, Senior Arts Editor

10. “This is Us”

Late at night, when you’re lying next to 
someone you love, a thought might strike you. 
If one thing had changed, your whole life would 
be different. “This is Us” is a show operating 
only on this thought. Its third season continues 
the work of its predecessors, building beauty 
out of the humdrum. Just when it seems like the 
Pearsons might be living life with a little too much 
comfort, they’re set back. The big date doesn’t 
go as planned, a community retaliates against 
assumptions about them and depression puts you 
to bed when you don’t take your meds. Its honesty 
and self-awareness easily are the best part of 
“This is Us.” It’s how the Pearson family wrangles 
with the moments where things fall apart and 
makes do. It’s how they admit they overreact. It’s 
how they try to grow, and fail at it. It’s the want to 
love and be loved. It might be a story about them, 
but at times, it feels like it could be about you as 
well. Season three has not seen the show turn 
towards the saccharine. Instead, it continues to 
straddle the line of feel good television and reality. 
Season three tightens its hug around viewers and 
envelopes you in such a way that an hour of “This 
is Us” has begun to feel like home.

2018 was yet another whirlwind 
year in the hurricane that has been 
the last half-decade, but luckily 
books, new and old, kept writers 
from all beats on Daily Arts sane. 
The Book Review asked a handful 
of them to write about their favorite 
moments with a book, literature or 
even reading itself this past year.

“Just 
Kids” 
by 
Patti Smith

My exposure to Patti Smith 
before I opened the first page 
of “Just Kids” was limited to 
childhood car rides with my 
parents and assertions by my 
friends that she was their second 
mother. I knew she had an album 
called Horses, which I had never 
consciously listened to, and thanks 
to the person that lent me the 
now treasured book (which I still 
must give back) I was aware of her 
relationship with photographer 
Robert Mapplethorpe.
“Just Kids” sets Mapplethorpe 
and Smith’s relationship against 
the backdrop of the New York City 
art scene of the late 1960’s through 
the ’70s. It would be an easy task 
for Smith to romanticize or brag 
about her impactful presence in 
post-Warhol New York, but she 
never comes off as anything short 
of sincere. Her genuine tone never 
breaks: From her retelling of the 
difficult arrival in the city to her 
eventual stardom, she doesn’t ask 
for anything from the reader other 
than to listen to her and Robert’s 
story.
Dispersed throughout the story 
are Mapplethorpe’s photographs 
and drawings. By placing his work 
in her memoir, Patti is able to give 
Robert a voice in the narrative to 
which he can no longer contribute. 
The reader feels her respect for 
Robert and all of the renowned 
artists she has the pleasure of 
sharing spaces with. Often, these 
artists come into her life on chance 
encounters, such as when Patti 
anxiously takes the stairs instead of 
the elevator to a recording studio to 
buy more time and runs into Jimi 

Hendrix who calms her by saying 
“parties make me nervous.”
Patti Smith’s memoir is a bay 
window into a magical era in New 
York City that she graciously opens 
to us. “Just Kids” introduced me to 
a world I wouldn’t have otherwise 
known existed. Every five pages I 
had to look up X location, Y person 
or Z reference.
On the inside flap is a quote 
by Joan Didion: “This book is so 
honest and pure as to count as a 
true rapture.” I’m with Didion. 
“Just Kids” shook my core, in only 
beautiful ways.

“I Love Dick” by 
Chris Kraus

When I read “I Love Dick,” I 
avoided being seen with it. It was 
like walking around with a bad 
Redbubble sticker on my book. 
And it’s not that I don’t love dick — 
It’s that “I Love Dick” looks like a 
nonchalant-sensational 
attention 
grab, and after so many annoying 
unsolicited remarks I was pissed 
off. 
The first half of the book doesn’t 
help much. Part one chronicles 
the not-so-fictional relationship 
between 
author-narrator-
filmmaker Chris and her husband, 
literary theorist Sylvère Lotringer, 
as Chris pursues an unrequited 
erotic crush on Dick, a renowned 
cultural critic. Chris’s crush is 
realized through a lengthy series 
of letters she and Sylvère compose 
to Dick, punchy epistles that wring 
and wrap their feeling in enough 
cerebral wit to render the obsession 
safely translucent. They do some 
kooky shit, they hurt each other, 
they entertain you in the padding 
of irony.
It could end there. Instead, 
Kraus flips the table by writing 
herself into the entire moment of 
part two, rejecting the brand of part 
one with so much conviction the 
prose practically drops 15 degrees. 
Chris’s letters to Dick morph 
into personal journals, a turn of 

direction that taps into the power 
of her raw, unresolved feeling for 
the first time. “Fifteen years ago … 
whenever I tried writing in the 1st 
Person it sounded like some other 
person …” Kraus shares. “Now I 
can’t stop … it’s just more serious: 
bringing change & fragmentation 
… down to where you really 
are.” Chris Kraus encounters the 
eroticism of her voice right there on 
the page, and it’s hot.
What’s even hotter about Kraus’s 
narrative coup is how masterfully it 
identifies and resists gender bias in 
the artistic community. She begins 
by permitting her own discontent, 
revisiting 
instances 
in 
which 
her work has been simplified by 
language like “insincere” and 
“quirky.” Instead of lapsing into 
echo-chamber diatribe, however, 
Kraus uses her intense feeling to 
critically bolster a series of similarly 
marginalized 
female 
artists. 
Hannah Wilke, Coco Fusco and 
Jennifer Harbury become motif-
contributors as Kraus weaves their 
work into an originally networked 
acknowledgement, 
calling 
to 
mind the dynamic sampling of 
Maggie Nelson’s “Argonauts,” a 
comparison I rarely award.
It 
seems 
important 
to 
acknowledge how the uncanny 
way I acquired and read “I Love 
Dick” set it up to be a watershed 
book in my personal library. It 
was recommended to me by a 
woman I have never met who 
was hired to edit the letters I was 
hired to write my students, then 
read across the borders of varying 
(united, psychological) states. The 
stars of reading circumstance 
certainly aligned, but I can’t shake 
the feeling that this situational 
voodoo is actually the work of 
Kraus. The generosity of her truth 
is so powerful it could wring 
whatever stars of circumstance 
into alignment.

Book moments that moved

1. Roma 

Before I saw “Roma,” I didn’t 
know I could be moved by piles 
of dogshit in a carport. I never 
noticed how the arrangement 
of family members around a 
television screen after dinner 
can constellate the dynamics 
of familial love. I didn’t think 
about how much it means 
when someone takes the time 
to wake you up in the morning 
— how intimate, how full of 
love, that is. But I don’t often 
know what image or scent or 
sound will lay sudden siege to 
my memory when I revisit sites 
of significance to my past. Nor 
do I know how to make these 
sudden sieges of memory legible 
to people other than myself. 
How to articulate gratitude 
to the inhabitants of these 
memories, to express gratitude 
for the ways they loved me 
without 
thinking. 
Alfonso 
Cuarón (“Gravity”) vindicated 
me of these frustrations.
In 
“Roma,” 
Cuarón’s 

intricate, 
semi-
autobiographical ode to his 
family’s 
housekeeper 
Lido 
(to whom he dedicates the 
film) as well as her role in 
his 
upbringing 
amid 
the 
socio-political tension of late 
20th-century 
Mexico 
City, 
speaks the language of memory 
and of honor to the women who 
shape our upbringings more 
fluently than any filmmaker 
in recent memory. Penning the 
story of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), 
Lido’s 
fictive 
counterpart, 
Cuarón 
amplifies 
quiet 
sufferings and desires, arranges 
before our eyes the unlikely 
keys to memory, and wisely 
selects certain doors to unlock 
and others to leave shut out 
of respect, reminding us that 
in a terrible, beautiful world, 
extraordinary love is just as 
possible as extraordinary evil. 
It’s as simple as that: “Roma” 
will remind you that there is 
a reason to live in this world, 
and 
people 
— 
specifically 
our mothers, biological and 
surrogate alike — to love and 
love back and thank. It is a 
welcome, well-timed reminder.

2. 
Spider-Man: 
Into the Spider-
Verse 

An awe-inspiring labor of 
love for all involved, Sony 
Pictures’s “Spider-Man: Into 
the Spider-Verse” seamlessly 

fuses 
numerous 
animation 
styles 
and 
mediums 
to 
create 2018’s most visually 
groundbreaking 
film. 
In 
a 
superhero genre oversaturated 
with statuesque white men, 
“Spider-Verse” follows half-
Latino, half-Black high schooler 
Miles Morales as he slings webs 
across the rooftops of a near-
future New York brimming 
with multiculturalism. Spider-
Man’s new look never feels 
like tokenization, and the film 
is effortlessly modern as it 
weaves hip-hop and R&B into a 
classic orchestral movie score. 
The result is a film that is sleek, 
in-touch and absurdly fun to 
watch.
It’s hard not to look at 
“Into 
the 
Spider-Verse” 
as 
pioneering when it upends so 
many classic superhero film 
conventions. It’s delightfully 
self-aware, 
often 
winking 
at the audience as it pokes 
fun at the superhero genre 
with fourth wall breaks and 
hilarious cameo performances 

from John Mulaney (“Saturday 
Night Live”) and Nicolas Cage 
(“Mandy”). Despite the film’s 
underperformance at the box-
office — more a testament 
to 
the 
stigma 
surrounding 
animated movies than to the 
film’s quality — it has fared well 
through awards season thus far, 
taking home the Golden Globe 
for Best Animated Feature 
Film. With any luck, the film’s 
warm critical reception should 
help to lend legitimacy to 
animation as a medium that 
extends beyond just children’s 
entertainment.

3. BlacKkKlansman

Spike Lee, the most veteran 
of directors behind the films in 
our list, returns with a 2018 joint 
that’s on-par with his best work 
to date. “BlacKkKlansman” is 
the dramatic retelling of the 
story of Ron Stallworth, the 
first Black police officer in 
Colorado Springs, who went 
on to lead an operation to 
infiltrate his town’s branch 
of the Ku Klux Klan. The 
real “Ron Stallworth” in the 
film is played by John David 
Washington (son of Denzel), 
though the “Ron Stallworth” in 
the film is really acted out by 
two different people, the police 
department using the white 
Adam Driver as the face of the 
undercover-duo when meeting 
with members of the Klan. 

Lee creates an atmosphere 
of a world on the brink of 
either fire-and-brimstone or a 
moment of empowered change, 
and the film’s surprisingly 
true-to-life premise sets up for 
a harrowing finish, ripe with 
intensity and implication.

4. The Favourite 

The 
prospects 
for 
“2018-in-film” 
were 
greatly 
improved in the month of 
Dec., and a portion of that 
excellence attributed to Yorgos 
Lanthimos’s historical feature 
“The Favourite,” a medieval 
farce starring Olivia Colman as 
a bratty Queen Anne, supported 
by Emma Stone and Rachel 
Weisz as two cabinet cousins. 
Played straight and severe, 
“The Favourite” finds funny in 
a grandly costumed satire about 
interpersonal cabinet relations 
while war rages on across the 

English Channel. Colman is a 
befuddled, blundering queen 
whose 
personal 
absurdities 
Stone and Weisz must dance 
around for the benefit of 
both their country and their 
pocketbooks. 
Beginning 
at 
the bottom as a peasant in the 
movie, Stone grabs the film by 
the neck and puts on a display 
with the same level of talent 
and tact that landed her on the 
top of the mountain in 2016. 
A spectacle of costume and 
character, “The Favourite” is a 
must-watch for anyone aiming 
to see the year’s best.

5. A Star is Born

The 
only 
imaginable 
explainable for why the A+ 
epic “A Star is Born” might not 
be ranked on your top ten list 
this year is if you haven’t yet 
had the privilege of witnessing 
(and being dazzled by) Cooper 
and Gaga’s on-screen magic. 
If, for some reason, the very 
combination 
of 
pop-legend 
Lady Gaga and dreamboat/
genius Bradley Cooper isn’t 
enough to make you split for 
the theater, let’s review a few of 
the key rationales for why this 
film is a non-negotiable must-
see for awards season (and for 
life in general).

Film’s 2018 movie favorites

Ranging from graphic novels to memoirs to 
longform poetry, the Michigan Daily Book Review 
ranks their favorite titles published in 2018.

1. “The Great Believers” by 
Rebecca Makkai

Rebecca Makkai’s novel “The Great Believers” 
is a slick, harrowing novel. Alternating between 
Chicago in the 1980s and Paris in 2015, the book 
revolves around a large cast of friends and family 
members, all of whose lives have been devastated 
by the AIDS crisis. In the 1980s, a group of gay 
friends is slowly winnowed as the disease performs 
its heinous magic trick; over and over, the healthy 
become sick and the sick become dead. In 2015, the 
now-middle-aged sister of one of these men travels 
to Paris to find her missing daughter. Tests and 
treatments arrive too late for these characters, and 
their lives are shattered, ended and emptied by the 
disease. As the two stories unfold, it becomes clear 
that each focus is the collateral damage of the other: 
one in actuality, the other in memory. Makkai is 
particularly interested in the micro- and macro-
legacy of AIDS. The disease ravages her characters’ 
interior lives as well as their bodies, and even those 
who survive it are left with wasteland of untethered, 
unconfirmable memory.
Sidestepping simplicity, Makkai deftly maneuvers 
the crossed wires of desire and fear, infidelity and 
devotion. The book is frequently heartrending but 
never sentimental. Near the end of the book, when 
one character tests positive for AIDS, he lists all the 
things he’ll miss when he dies. In another writer’s 
less skillful hands, this could have been mawkish, 
but as is her signature, Makkai lets it be tenderly 
simple. “The brutal wind on the El platform. Fifty 
people huddled under the heating lamp. Pigeons 
crowding their feet,” she writes. “The man at Wax 
Trax! Records with the beautiful eyelashes. The 
man who sat every Saturday at Nookies, reading 
The Economist and eating eggs, his ears always 
strangely red. The ways his own life might have 
intersected with theirs, given enough time, enough 
energy, a better universe.”

— Miriam Francisco, Copy Chief & Daily Arts 
Writer

2. “The Recovering” by 
Leslie Jamison

Leslie Jamison’s latest combines all the things 
I’ve loved about her since her 2014 release “The 
Empathy Exams” — a careful, insistent prose style, 
a way with words that skips past pretense and 
narrative tricks and a uniquely keen insight into 
the human heart. “The Recovering: Intoxication 
and its Aftermath” is an urgent, insistent read, an 
examination not just of her own alcoholism, but 
also of the nature of addiction itself. She weaves a 
personal narrative through a tapestry of a larger 

interrogation of what it means to want, to be out 
of control. Jamison’s writing has a way of working 
itself directly into the heart and brain of her readers, 
rendering the space between the words she’s using 
and the feeling she’s describing negligible. Reading 
Jamison’s work feels not like an education but more 
like an expansion — an expansion of empathy, 
understanding, of capacity for hope. I trust her 
writing to take me anywhere.

— Asif Becher, Daily Arts Writer

3. “Heavy: An American 
Memoir” by Kiese Laymon

I read, was knocked to the ground by and wrote 
about “Heavy” back in November, but have been 
ruminating on it since. It’s the type of book that 
sinks into your bones, adding some requisite weight 
to every step thereafter, a reckoning I haven’t 
experienced so viscerally since Ta Nehisi Coates’s 
“Between the World and Me.” While Coates 
addresses his book to his son, Laymon writes to 
his mother, allowing room for more complicated 
conversation on the Black body and the (physical, 
verbal, psychological) violence it endures. In 
particular, Laymon writes to identify the violence 
deeply ingrained in his own family: where it began, 
how it became codified and what it does to the 
bodies that give and receive it.

Turning the pen towards oneself is an arduous 
project, and the text is dense with Laymon’s moving 
effort and care. Although difficult, “Heavy” is a 
beautiful read. Laymon’s prose runs with tasteful 
repetition and an eye for detail, allowing the music 
of some moments and dashing imperative severity 
to others. The movement of Laymon’s language 
lends his book a sense of physical activity — one feels 
like they’ve covered some distance at the end, and 
the body is phantom-tired. “Heavy” is exhausting, 
but necessarily so, as if creating the circumstances 
necessary for recovery.

— Verity Sturm, Books Review Editor

4. “Florida” by Lauren Groff

“Florida,” Lauren Groff’s most recent collection of 
short stories, is a menagerie of things made wild by 
their environs. The setting of these stories — Florida, 
of course — is a broken incubator for the extremes 
of weather, emotion and beauty. Her characters 
(wives, mothers, sisters, children) grapple with the 
intrusive presence of their home state, an ambient 
specter that is both gorgeous and grotesque. Groff 
currently lives in Gainesville, Fla., and her intimate 
knowledge of the state’s peculiarities is evident. In 
“Florida,” pain and violence are inextricable from 
the quietly fantastic landscape.

6. Black Panther

In a year that saw dozens of heroes uniting to stop a 
universe-spanning calamity, “Black Panther” still became not 
just the best MCU movie of the year, but the best film Marvel 
Studios has put out to date. At its best, Coogler’s latest plays 
like a Shakespearean epic crossed with the visual panache of 
“The Matrix” with a little bit of James Bond thrown in for 
good measure. That’s a diverse set of influences for anyone to 
wrangle together, yet Coogler still molds them into something 
that feels wholly original from top to bottom. The action is 
crisp, the cinematography and production design is beautiful; 
it’s nothing short of a triumph of worldbuilding, art direction 
and storytelling. Everybody on both sides of the camera gives 
it their all with each scene.
It’s hard to pick a true stand-out from the cast, as Chadwick 
Boseman absolutely nails the balance between relatability and 
regality in the title role while Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira 
and Winston Duke round out one of the best supporting casts 
of the year (M’Baku laughing at his own joke might be the 
single most endearing moment in 2018 entertainment). Yet the 
undeniable scene stealer is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger in 
what might be the MCU’s first Oscar-nominated performance. 
In a film all about what it means to have power, Jordan 
portrays just the opposite: a man inundated with feelings 
of powerlessness and driven by a sense of righteous fury, 
grounding the performance in a humanity that many other 
MCU villains sorely lack. It’s Ryan Coogler’s world, we’re just 
living in it.

– Jeremiah Vanderhelm, Daily Arts Writer

7. Avengers: Infinity War

Although heralded as the biggest crossover of all time and 
the culmination of the ten year Marvel Superhero Saga, this 
bursting at the seams adventure epic is merely the prologue 
to an even bigger conclusion coming this spring. But while 
the marketing may have been misleading, the film itself is 
the ultimate realization of what the Marvel universe can be 
when maximized to its full potential: a comic book brought 
to life. No movie has ever felt more like a comic book than 
“Infinity War” in the way it weaves between storylines and 
the sheer number of characters and locations it throws at the 
audience. In the case of “Infinity War,” bigger is better, it’s 
hard to imagine a film that is larger in scale. Is it totally and 
completely satisfying? Not really. But in channeling the spirit 
of other fantasy and sc-fi epics like “Lord of the Rings” and 
“Star Wars,” it becomes the first Marvel movie to tap into 
the inner power of epic mythology and present itself not just 
as an event film but as the event itself. To quote Nick Fury 
in Joss Whedon’s original “Avengers,” what “Infinity War” 
represents isn’t a Marvel movie with stakes, but a promise 
of a Marvel universe with the one thing it’s been missing: 
catharsis. Come this May, audiences around the world will 
have the opportunity to see if it was worth it.

 – Ian Harris, Daily Arts Writer

8. Eighth Grade

I saw “Eighth Grade” at the Nantucket Film Festival this 
summer and the whole time I couldn’t help thinking, is that 
Mike Birbiglia sitting two rows in front of me? So I spent the 
entirety of the film looking at Mike Birbiglia, monitoring 
his every reaction in time with my own. Was Mike Birbiglia 
laughing? I shall laugh. Was Mike Birbiglia crying? Here come 
the tears. Was Mike Birbiglia 
trying to get a popcorn kernel 
out of his rearmost molar? The 
entire audience felt swarmed 
with 
the 
awkward 
energy 
emanating from Bo Burnham’s 
cringe-fest of a coming-of-age 
film. We squirmed in unison as 
Kayla (a brilliant performance 
from newcomer Elsie Fisher) 
comments, selfies and DMs 
her way through the horrific 
awkwardness of middle school 
social 
situations. 
“Eighth 
Grade” is the coming-of-age 
film of today. It’s “Pretty in 
Pink” 
plus 
Instagram 
and 
minus racism. The millennial 
comedian’s 
writing 
and 
directing debut is nothing 
short of genius. John Hughes 
would be proud.

 – Becky Portman, Daily 
Arts Writer

9. Mission: Impossible — Fallout

In a year saturated with franchise blockbusters, “Mission: 
Impossible — Fallout” managed to both dominate the mid-
summer box office and raise the bar for future action movies. 
“Fallout” arrived with an energy and dedication to meticulous 
stunt work that immediately lent the film comparisons to 
2015’s “Mad Max: Fury Road.” The comparisons are more than 
valid: “Fallout” is and should be the new standard against 
which action set pieces are held.
The sixth installment of the “Mission: Impossible” series 
could only be built upon a collective awareness of Tom Cruise as 
the actor who constantly challenges his physical capabilities. 
That’s why the narrative of “Fallout” doesn’t matter as much 
as most movies. The intricacies of the backroom espionage are 
not the reason the film captivates so many.
The action set pieces in “Fallout” are comfortably some of 
the strongest in the franchise and arguably some of the most 
jaw-dropping ever made. It’s hard to recall a moment in film 
from 2018 as thrilling as the one-take HALO skydive near the 
beginning of “Fallout.” Of course it is equally impossible to 
forget an uncommonly jarring bathroom fight scene or Cruise 
leaping from building to building (and actually breaking his 
ankle in a shot that made the film’s final cut). Above all, 
“Fallout” serves as a reminder for why we go to the movies in 
the first place. It is an unrelentingly tense yet undemanding 
joyride of an action blockbuster that is as adrenaline-fueled as 
it is intelligent and boundary-pushing.

– Anish Tamhaney, Daily Arts Writer

10. Incredibles 2

The release of the much-anticipated sequel to “The 
Incredibles” showcases our generation’s desperate need 
for a feel-good, nostalgic movie — something to bring back 
the carefree energy of our childhood — and “Incredibles 2” 
does not disappoint. Set immediately after the ending of the 
original movie, “Incredibles 2” follows the Parr family as they 
try to navigate a new environment where the family’s powers 
are on full display in a world where “supers” are still illegal.
Like all Disney-Pixar movies, “Incredibles 2” develops 
important social commentary under the sophisticated guise 
of a kids’ movie. The primary storyline, in which Helen 
is the main super of the household, represents a shift in 
expectations for women and how our society handles this 
change. In a year marked by prominent feminist messages and 
female empowerment, “Incredibles 2” addresses the complex 
relationship that grows from a woman returning to work while 
her husband stays home to take care of the family.
“Incredibles 2” is every bit as super as its lead family and 
then some. The movie brought back a franchise most of us 
thought long-gone and proved that sentimentality can be every 
bit as successful as a steroid-driven action movie. Nominated 
for a Golden Globe, “Incredibles 2” finds its way into all of our 
hearts and will stay there for years to come.

Our favorite films from this past year, continued

The swankiest directorial debuts of last year

Bo Burnham, “Eighth Grade”

Maybe Bo Burnham was exactly the right person to tackle 
adolescence on the internet. Bo Burnham got his start on 
YouTube making nonsensical music, eventually moving to 
six-second video platform Vine and scoring his own stand-up 
specials on Netflix. Yet his success never gave him an inflated 
sense of self-importance — if anything, the sweet neuroticism 
that defined his bedroom YouTube videos only grew stronger. 
In an interview with The Daily over the summer, Burnham said 
“I just wanted to do an intense movie about being this person, 
not what it means to be a kid always throughout all of time. I was 
feeling very nervous and panicked and anxious on the internet, 
and I was looking at the internet and meeting people, and I saw 
all these people also feeling very nervous and panicked in their 
lives too.” Burnham channels these common, but culturally new 
feelings through Kayla (Elsie Fisher, “Despicable Me 2”), whose 
generation, by circumstance, has had unparalleled access to the 
internet. Most 20-somethings and young adults are familiar with 
ways the internet can interfere with how you express yourself. 
Anxieties about a crush turn into vague AIM status messages 
or logging in and out to generate notifications. Arguments and 
confrontations reach nebulous ends, as “leaving somebody on 
read” or “ghosting” become increasingly common terminology. 
And yet, despite their ubiquity, the effects of the internet on our 
most core selves have never been depicted as accurately as they 
have in “Eighth Grade.” Burnham’s directorial debut marks a 
watershed as an unflinching yet warm portrayal of being young 
online.

— Jack Brandon, Managing Arts Editor

Boots Riley, “Sorry to Bother You”

Rarely is a directorial debut from an absolute-unknown; 
especially one as fresh and surprising as Boots Riley’s “Sorry 
to Bother You.” It’s a fantastical satire about telemarketers 
and (not so subtly) ultimately the sociopolitical relationship 
between corporations and the workforce. It’s not surprising, 
then, that the road to get “Sorry” onto the big-screen was a 
long and winding one, with Riley fighting through a decade of 
production deliberations and setbacks to finally see his vision 
realized on screen. And “Sorry” could only really be his vision. 
No one else could have cooked up the type of fever-dream, 
fever-pitch whirlwind we end up with. Thank goodness he stuck 
with it to the end.

Not to give too much away, “Sorry to Bother You” is a film 
that always seems to have one more surprise up its sleeve. Riley 
is seemingly determined to never stop throwing wrenches 
and humanitarian crises at his audience. No-name directorial 
debuts tend toward the safe side, often resulting in callow 
pictures with little scripts that aim for a “less-is-more” mis en 
scene. “Sorry to Bother You” spits in the face of anybody telling 
it that it can’t shoot for the moon, with Riley biting off more 
than anyone can chew in the best possible way.

— Stephen Satarino, Film Editor

Ari Aster, “Hereditary”

Horror movies are often treated with a sense of escapism. 
They allow viewers to feel scared for a contained period and 

continue on with their lives without a second thought. In sharp 
contrast, the reason that “Heredity” is so claustrophobically 
terrifying and one of the year’s best films is that it never truly 
leaves you after the credits roll.

Ari Aster’s feature-length debut functions in many ways 
like a drama rather than a scary movie, centering around how 
tragedy deteriorates the livelihood of the Graham family. By 
constructing the film like a family drama, Aster avoids tiresome 
horror cliches. There is no killer. There are few jump scares. 
There is no easy escape from the danger. The true demons of 
“Hereditary” are just ordinary people. This is what makes the 
film one of the most original and unforgettable of the year.

As important as it is to discuss Aster’s creativity, it’s just 
as important as the technical means by which that creativity 
manifests on screen. The lighting is often dim and somber, 
allowing a viewer to see the defining features of an performer’s 
visage but nothing more. The walls of the Graham house 
eventually feel like they are caving in like an abyss. Another 
ingenious method of Aster’s is to hold a shot for longer than 
expected on a painful or unsettling image, forcing viewers to 
powerlessly stew in grim discomfort.

“Hereditary” is a truly special horror movie. It enshrines 
Aster as an important name in the future of the genre and as 
a filmmaker whose future works will surely be too frightening 
to miss.

— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Arts Writer

Bradley Cooper, “A Star is Born”

You might know him as Phil, the dentist from “The Hangover,” 
or Ben, Amy Poehler’s partner in musical theater crime in 
“Wet Hot American Summer” or as David O. Russell’s favorite 
leading man. However you recognize the versatile actor with 
those piercing blue eyes. He is now officially a director. As a 
filmmaker, 
Bradley 
Cooper 
(“Burnt”) crafted the fourth 
re-make of “A Star is Born” 
with immense care, ensuring 
its 
predecessors 
were 
not 
overlooked while keeping a 
fierce eye at the future. The 
first-time director managed 
to add significant depth and 
raw emotion to a tale often 
wrought with conventionality 
and sappiness. The film is a 
stunning 
manifestation 
of 
the filmmaker’s vision and 
knowledge 
of 
filmmaking, 
incorporating strong editing 
choices, 
sophisticated 
camerawork 
and 
an 
ear 
for 
music 
emphasized 
by 
his co-star’s (Lady Gaga as 
“Ally”) talent. I have a feeling 
Cooper’s directing days are 
long from over; rather, he’s 
just getting started.

— Becky Portman, Daily Arts Writer

Peter Ramsey, Robert Persichetti 
Jr. and Rodney Rothman, “Spider-
Man: Into the Spiderverse”

Calling “Into the Spiderverse” a directorial debut is 
something of a misnomer given that Peter Ramsey, one of the 
three directors, had previously helmed “Rise of the Guardians” 
in 2012, but being as his two co-directors Bob Persichetti and 
Rodney Rothman were both newcomers to the director’s chair, 
I’ll say two out of three isn’t bad. Frankly, I’ll take any chance I 
can get to praise this movie.

If the job of a director is to take the various elements of 
filmmaking and storytelling and make them work together 
toward a singular purpose, then “Into the Spiderverse” is one of 
the best directed films of the year. From beginning to end, it’s 
a psychedelic, hyper-kinetic ride that boasts groundbreaking 
animation and a slew of pop culture references, yet everything 
always comes back to the characters and their arcs. The color 
scheme, the “Scott Pilgrim”-esque insertions of comic book 
imagery, the score, everything. At the center of “Into the 
Spiderverse” is Miles Morales and everything else exists in his 
orbit.

That isn’t to say that the rest of the movie is underdeveloped in 
any way. Each of the supporting characters is made memorable in 
their own way — from Hailee Steinfeld’s (“Bumblebee”) Spider-
Gwen to Nic Cage’s (“Mandy”) hysterical Spider-Man Noir 
— and are made even more so by the careful attention paid to 
what makes them Spider-Man. It’s the ethos of the film: Anyone 
can be a hero, anyone can be Spider-Man, and by forefronting 
this spirit through such a diverse set of characters in terms 
of personality and animation style, Ramsey, Persichetti and 
Rothman ensure their film enters into the realm of the greats.
