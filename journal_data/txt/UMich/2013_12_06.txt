Menna's to bring
signature 'Dubs' to
East William Street
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily News Editor
Though Ann Arbor in known
for being on the vanguard of res-
taurant culture, the incoming
restaurant on East William Street
- Menna's Joint - will be the
sixth campus location for the East
Lansing-based burrito chain.
Menna's will fill the space
recently vacated by Toppers
Pizza, the now-closed pizza fran-
chise at East William and May-
nard Streets. The joint is known
for "the Dub," a grilled wrap
sandwich filled with ingredients
ranging from potatoes to chicken
tenders. Other locations beside
Michigan State University include
Western Michigan University and
Central Michigan University.
Hank Andries, the current
owner of the chain, said they hope
to open the Ann Arbor branch in
March after renovating the East
William space. Andries said most
of the changes in the restau-
rant will be cosmetic, but added
that the kitchen will have to be
changed to fit their needs.

Andries said the company has
been looking for a space in Ann
Arbor for several years, but has
had trouble finding available
storefronts.
"There's a lot of demand and
not alot of real estate, so it's diffi-
cult to find the right location that
fits and makes sense," Andries
said. "So this opportunity came
up and it seemed to be the perfect
fit."
Brendan Cavender, a broker
with Colliers International, said
his company has been working
with Menna's for about five years
and is glad they finally found a
space that is suitable for the res-
taurant.
Colliers also helped bring other
restaurants like Firehouse Subs
and NeoPapalis to East William
Street.
"East William is so close to
campus. It's right next to the
Diag - it was a natural boom that
the retail starts creeping down
there," Cavender said. "And with
the addition to Zaragon (West),
it's really helped the foot traffic
down there."
While Menna's is an East Lan-
sing-based restaurant, it is not the
first chain to have locations near
both the University and MSU.

Amidst national
movement, USAS
demands better
pay, worker's rights
By BROOKE PEARCY
For the Daily
While it's typically quiet at 9
a.m. as students shuffle to early
morning classes, the Diag was
filled Thursday with cries of
"Hey Wendy's, you can't hide;

we can see your greedy side."
The chants were part of a sol-
idarity event planned by United
Students Against Sweatshops
and JustDems, a committee of
College Democrats that focuses
on social justice issue. USAS
organized the event to support
causes such as an increase in
the minimum wage to $15 per
hour and fast food workers'
right to unionize.
The group of students also
included representatives from
the University's chapter of the
College Democrats, the Lectur-

ers' Employee Organization,
the Washtenaw Community
Action Team and the Graduate
Employees' Organization.
Starting at The Cube, the
group marched through cam-
pus handing out flyers to stu-
dents and delivering letters to
fast-food workers in the Michi-
gan Union and the Michigan
League.
LSA sophomore Ryne Men-
hennick, co-chair of JustDems,
said he hoped the event helped
raise awareness for the cause.
"One of the main goals was

to show the workers that we're
standing with them and sup-
porting them in their struggle
for better wages, better benefits
and better hours," Menhennick
said.
The USAS protest was part
of a larger, nationwide strike
organized Thursday. Fast-food
workers in 100 cities across the
country coordinated a walkout
in support of Fight for 15, a Chi-
cago-based labor organization
of fast food and retail workers.
Fight for 15 contacted the

Tamaki serves

Asian flavors

OPEN PARTY

New E. Liberty
establishment
to provide fast,
affordable eats
By WILLIAM LANE
For the Daily
While Chipotle and Subway
dominate the to-go scene, a
new sushi restaurant plans to
stir up the competition.
Tamaki Custom Sushi and
Wraps opened its doors Nov.
19 on East Liberty Street with
lines of up to 40 students
stretched out the door as curi-
ous patrons waited to sample
the restaurant's signature
"Wolverine Roll."
The restaurant is set up in a
"fast-casual" format - similar
in style to Chipotle or Noodles
and Company - as customers
see their order made in front of
them with their choice of ingre-
dients. Owner Frank Cheng,
who operates several similar
locations in Lansing, said speed
and affordability are key com-

ponents of appealing to a stu-
dent population.
"We triedto fuse alot of pop-
ular elements of Asian cuisine
into our menu, so we are not
the traditional Japanese sushi
joint," Cheng said. "People
want something quick, fresh
and affordable."
Cheng said Ann Arbor pro-
vided a great location to expand
his business due to its large stu-
dent population. To satisfy stu-
dents' late-night cravings, the
restaurant will stay open until
3:00 a.m. Thursday through
Saturday.
Tamaki joins several simi-
lar restaurants on East Liberty
Street that specialize in Asian
cuisine, such as Tomukun
Noodle Bar and TK Wu. Mei
Chen, manager of TK Wu, said
she had not noticed a change in
business since the opening of
Tamaki. She said her restaurant
differentiates itself because
it serves traditional Chinese
food, whereas Tamaki serves
modern fusion.

12th Fast-A-Thon
By AMIA DAVIS
Daily StaffReporter
The Muslim Students' Associa-
tion held its Fast-a-Thon Thursday, a
fundraising event aimed to test will-
power, practice self-discipline and
allow non-Muslims to experience
fasting.
Participants fasted from sun-
rise to sunset, and they didn't just
abstain from food and water - they
also opted out of activities like video
games and online shopping, guilty
pleasures that Tayssir Safi Moham-
med, the University's Muslim chap-
lain, said inhibit spiritual life.
In its 12th year, MSA donated
money raised from Fast-a-Thon to
Rainbow Connection, a Michigan-
based organization that grants the
wishes of terminally ill children and
provides assistance to their families.

Information gap causes issues

Nelson Mandela dies at age

for the future of Medicaid users 95 in Johannesburg home

Government says
states using federal
website experience
the problem
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - People
shopping for insurance on the fed-
eral marketplace may be informed
they're eligible for Medicaid and
that their information is being
sent to state officials to sign them
up. However, states say they aren't
able to enroll them because they're
receivingincomplete data fromthe
Obama administration.
The Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services wrote a memo
to the 36 states using the federal
website last week acknowledg-
ing the information wasn't being
transferred automatically and
saying another system was being
developed to send it. More com-
plete files could be sent as soon as
next week.

The technical problem could
affect tens of thousands of Medic-
aid applicants and represents the
latest issue to arise in the rollout
of a website that's been plagued
with long waits for users and other
glitches.
Some users who fill out appli-
cations on the federal site may
believe that they're already being
enrolled in Medicaid or that state
officials will contact them, even
though the agencies aren't receiv-
ing the information they need,
said Matt Salo, executive direc-
tor of the National Association
of Medicaid Directors. The data
transfer problem is occurring in
the 36 states where the federal site
is deployed, regardless of whether
they chose to expand Medicaid.
"Essentially, if you're a consum-
er on healthcare.gov, it will tell
you you're eligible for Medicaid
and the state agency will take care
of it, but there's no real way for the
state Medicaid agency to know
anything about it," said Salo, who

555UW

leads the nonpartisan membership
group for state Medicaid chiefs.
The federal marketplace was
designed to help people buy pri-
vate insurance under President
Barack Obama's health overhaul.
If shoppers qualified for Medic-
aid, the site was supposed to send
their data to the Medicaid agency
in their state.
As explained on healthcare.gov,
"When you finish this application,
we'll tell you which programs you
and your family qualify for. If it
looks like anyone is eligible for
Medicaid, we'll let the Medicaid
agency know so your coverage can
start in 2014."
The site also says: "If you or a
member of your family qualify for
Medicaid or CHIP, a representa-
tive will contact you to enroll."
CHIP is a health insurance pro-
gram for children.
The federal Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services has devised
an alternative way of sending files
including the patient information
to the states.
"CMS announced that we will
be providing states with additional
flexibility to use existing processes
to enroll individuals in Medicaid
and CHIP who applied through
the federal marketplace. This pro-
cess will ensure that coverage will
begin on Jan. 1 for newly eligible
enrollees," said spokeswoman
Emma Sandoe.
Salo said the federal govern-
ment is currently sending states
incomplete data files on people
deemed eligible online - data
called "flat files" - so that agen-
cies can get a rough estimate of
how many people they may need
to enroll.
New files with more informa-
tion could be sent as soon as Tues-
day, Salo said. But states are unsure
the new files will be complete or
accurate enough for enrollments.
"States that want to can take it
as gospel and use the information
to enroll people," he said. "But that
sets up the question, how sure are
we the information is going to be
correct? Is hasn't been up until
now. Can the state afford to just
take that on faith?"

Prominent civil
rights leader leaves
legacy as fighter for
peace, equality
JOHANNESBURG (AP) -
Nelson Mandela was a master of
forgiveness.
South Africa's first black
president spent nearly a third
of his life as a prisoner of apart-
heid, yet he sought to win over
its defeated guardians in a rel-
atively peaceful transition of
power that inspired the world.
As head of state, the for-
mer boxer, lawyer and inmate
lunched with the prosecutor
who argued successfully for
his incarceration. He sang the
apartheid-era Afrikaans anthem
at his inauguration and trav-
eled hundreds of miles to have
tea with the widow of the prime
minister in power at the time he
was sent to prison.
It was this generosity of spirit
that made Mandela, who died
Thursday at the age of 95, a glob-
al symbol of sacrifice and recon-
ciliation in a world often jarred
by conflict and division.
Mandela's stature as a fighter
against apartheid - the system
of white racist rule he called evil
- and a seeker of peace with.his
enemies was on a par with that
of other men he admired: Amer-
ican civil rights activist Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. and Indian
independence leader Mohandas
K. Gandhi, both of whom were
assassinated while actively
engaged in their callings.
Mandela's death deprived the
world of one of one of the great
figures of modern history and
set the stage for days of mourn-
ing and reflection about a colos-
sus of the 20th century who
projected astonishing grace,
resolve and good humor.
Dressed in black, South Afri-
can President Jacob Zuma made
the announcement on television.
He said Mandela died "peace-
fully," surrounded by family, at

around 8:50 p.m.
"We've lost our greatest son.
Our nation has lost its great-
est son. Our people have lost a
father," Zuma said. "Although
we knew that this day would
come, nothing can diminish our
sense of a profound and endur-
ing loss."
At times, Mandela embraced
his iconic status, appearingbefore
a rapturous crowd in London's
Wembley Stadium soon after his
1990 release from prison. Some-
times, he sought to downplay it,
uneasy about the perils of being
put on a pedestal. In an unpub-
lished manuscript, written while
in prison, Mandela acknowledged
that leaders of the anti-apartheid
movement dominated the spot-
light but said they were "only part
of the story," and every activist
was "like a brick which makes up
our organization."
He pondered the cost to his
family of his dedication to the
fight against the racist system of
government that jailed him for
27 years and refused him per-
mission to attend the funeral of
his mother and of a son who was
killed in a car crash. In court, he
described himself as "the loneli-
est man" during his mid-1990s
divorce from Winnie Mandela.
As president, he could not forge
lasting solutions to poverty,
unemployment and other social
ills that still plague today's
South Africa, which has strug-
gled to live up to its rosy depic-
tion as the "Rainbow Nation."
He secured near-mythical sta-
tus in his country and beyond.
Last year, the South African cen-
tral bank released new banknotes
showing his face, a robust, smiling
image of a man who was meticu-
lous about his appearance and
routinely exercised while in pris-
on. South Africa erected statues
of him and named buildings and
other places after him. He shared
the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with
F.W. de Klerk, the country's last
white president. He was the sub-
ject of books, films and songs and
a magnet for celebrities.
In 2010, Mandela waved to

the crowd at the Soccer City sta-
dium at the closing ceremony of
the World Cup, whose stagingin
South Africa allowed the coun-
try, and the continent, to shine
internationally. It was the last
public appearance for the for-
mer president and prisoner, who
smiled broadly and was bundled
up against the cold.
One of the most memorable of
his gestures toward racial har-
mony was the day in 1995 when
he strode onto the field before
the Rugby World Cup final in
Johannesburg, and then again
after the game, when he con-
gratulated the home team for its
victory over a tough New Zea-
land team. Mandela was wear-
ing South African colors and the
overwhelmingly white crowd of
63,000 was on its feet, chanting
"Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!"
It was typical of Mandela to
march headlong into a bastion
of white Afrikanerdom - in
this case the temple of South
African rugby - and make its
followers feel they belonged in
the new South Africa.
The moment was portrayed
in "Invictus," Clint Eastwood's
movie telling the story of South
Africa's transformation through
the prism of sport.
It was a moment half a cen-
tury in the making. In the 1950s,
Mandela sought universal rights
through peaceful means but was
sentenced to life imprisonment
in 1964 for leading a campaign
of sabotage against the govern-
ment. The speech he gave dur-
ing that trial outlined his vision
and resolve.
"During my lifetime I have
dedicated myself to this struggle
of the African people," Mandela
said. "I have fought against white
domination, and I have fought
against black domination. I have
cherished the ideal of a demo-
cratic and free society in which
all persons live together in har-
mony and with equal opportuni-
ties. It is an ideal which I hope
to live for and to achieve. But if
needs be, it is an ideal for which
I am prepared to die."

Yemen's Defense Ministry
attacked by militant group

U.S. military vows
protection and
voices support for
political allies
ADEN, Yemen (AP) - Mili-
tants stormed the Defense Min-
istry in the heart of Yemen's
capital Thursday, killing 52
people, including at least seven
foreigners, in a suicide car bomb-
ing and assault by gunmen. The
brazen, al-Qaida-style attack fol-
lows a rise in U.S. drone strikes
in this key American ally in the
Middle East.
The two-stage operation came
as the defense minister was in
Washington for talks. The U.S.
military increased its regional
alert status after the attack and
is "fully prepared to support our
Yemeni partners," a senior U.S.
defense official said.
At least 167 people were
wounded, nine seriously, in the
bombing and fierce firefight,
which underscored the ability of
insurgents to take advantage of
Yemen's instability and tenuous
security - even at the headquar-
ters of its military.
Amongthe dead atthe Defense
Ministry complex, which also
houses a military hospital, were
soldiers and civilians, includ-
ing seven foreigners - two aid
workers from Germany, two doc-
tors from Vietnam, two nurses
from the Philippines and a nurse
from India, accordingto Yemen's
Supreme Security Commission,
which issued the casualty fig-
ures. Among the Yemeni civil-
ians killed were a doctor and a
senior judge, it said.
There was no immediate claim
of responsibility for the attack,
the deadliest in Sanaa since May

2012. Such suicide bombings and
complex attacks are the hall-
marks of al-Qaida.
The U.S. considers Yemen's al-
Qaida branch, known as al-Qaida
in the Arabian Peninsula, to be
the most active in the world. In
recent months, Washington has
sharply escalated drone attacks
against the militants in the
impoverished nation. U.S. forces
also have been training and arm-
ing Yemeni special forces, and
exchanging intelligence with the
central government.
The terrorist network gained
a major foothold in the south,
taking over several towns in
the chaos that followed the 2011
uprising that ousted longtime
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
The drone strikes and a series of
U.S.-backed military offensives
helped uproot several key mili-
tant strongholds, but al-Qaida
continues to fight back.
Al-Qaida's Yemen branch
is linked to the foiled plot on
Christmas 2009 in which a pas-
senger on a Detroit-bound plane
allegedly tried to detonate explo-
sives in his underwear, as well as
explosives-laden parcels inter-
cepted on cargo flights a year
later.
Defense Minister Mohammed
Nasser Ahmed was in Washing-
ton for consultations with U.S.
officials, part of a "strategic dia-
logue" to aid Yemen's political
transition and security coopera-
tion.
Thursday's attacks "will not
deter the security forces, the
armed forces and the honorable
sons of the nation from carry-
ing out their religious and patri-
otic duty in the face of terrorists
wherever they may be," said the
statement by the Supreme Secu-
rity Commission. It is led by
President Abed Rabbo Mansour

Hadi, who succeeded Saleh, and
includes the country's top mili-
tary and intelligence officials.
The senior U.S. defense offi-
cial said the U.S. military "has
increased its regional alert status
following the terrorist attack on
the Yemeni Republic Ministry of
Defense."
"The United States military
is fully prepared to support our
Yemeni partners in the wake of
this incident," added the official,
who was not authorized to speak
publicly about the matter and
requested anonymity.
The U.S. State Department
condemned the attack.
"We stand with Yemen against
this violence and remain firmly
committed to supporting the
Yemeni people," said a statement
from the State Department's
deputy spokeswoman, Marie
Harf.
Sam Wilkin, a Dubai-based
Middle East analyst for the Con-
trol Risks consulting firm, said
the attack displayed the ability of
the militants to move explosives
and armed fighters to a part of
the capital that should be heavily
protected.
"It suggests al-Qaida's current
strategy is to degrade the capa-
bilities of the security forces and
demoralize them to the extent
they're no longer able to control
certain areas of the country," he
said.
At that point, "al-Qaida will
probably try to fill that vacuum
and effectively take control of
certain areas," Wilkin added.
Although al-Qaida militants
are concentered in the south-
ern and eastern parts of Yemen,
they occasionally strike in the
capital. In May 2012, a suicide
bombing near the presidential
palace in Sanaa killed 93 army
conscripts.

Production location
for the 777X jetliner
tobe decided
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.
(AP) - With Boeing the king
of U.S. aircraft manufacturing,
more than a dozen states are
groveling before the throne for
a share of the riches to be made
from the next-generation 777
jetliner.
From coast to coast, states
are rushing to impress Boeing
with lavish incentive pack-
ages that offer property, labor
deals and billions of dollars
in tax breaks. All this in the
hopes that the aerospace giant
will select them to assemble
the new 777X - or at least give
them a wing to construct.
The competition under-
scores Boeing's commanding
bargaining position in an econ-
omy where top-notch manu-
facturing jobs remain scarce
and elected officials feel obli-
gated to pursue every growth
opportunity, no matter how
improbable.
"We have gotten a tremen-
dous response, and it's obvi-
ously created a lot of interest
and alot of excitement," Boeing
spokesman Doug Alder said.
The contest unfolded in a
mere matter of weeks after a
machinists' union in Wash-
ington state rejected Boeing's
proposed contract for the 777X
because it would have replaced
their traditional pension with
a defined-contribution savings
plan.
The Chicago-based compa-
ny said it would look elsewhere
and gave states until Tuesday
to submit proposals. Winners
will be announced early next
year.
The Boeing buzz has been
loudest in Missouri, where
Gov. Jay Nixon immediately
convened a special legislative
session to approve an incen-
tive package valued at up to
$1.7 billion over more than two
decades. The plan passed the

Senate with bipartisan sup-
port Wednesday and could win
final approval in the House on
Friday. Boeing never even had
to send a lobbyist to talk to a
lawmaker.
Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt,
a Republican hoping to entice
Boeing to expand in his home-
town of St. Louis, called the
package "a transformational
opportunity."
Other states are keeping the
details of their offers out of the
public spotlight - and away
from the inquisitive eyes of
their rivals- by crafting them
through administrative agen-
cies shielded by non-disclosure
laws.
Last year, Alabama lured
Boeing's biggest world-
wide rival, Airbus, to build a
$600 million assembly plant
in Mobile by offering tax
breaks and $158 million for
bond expenses, site and road
improvements, building costs
and worker training.
This time, Gov. Robert Bent-
ley is stressing more than just
financial incentives. He's tap-
ping into Boeing's recent union
frustrations by highlight-
ing that Alabama is a "right-
to-work" state, where union
fees cannot be a condition of
employment.
Bentley said Boeing officials
told him that Alabama was
their first state to visit after
the union deal fell through. But
other states also have reason to
hope.
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said
Boeing leaders reached out
to him, too. Utah officials are
emphasizing that they have
the youngest workforce in the
U.S., as well as right-to-work
rules. And it doesn't hurt that
Boeing is already set to open an
850,000-square foot factory in
a Salt Lake City suburb to make
tail parts for a different model
of plane.
Other states in the hunt -
including Kansas, North and
South Carolina and Texas -
are banking on right-to-work
laws of their own.

Cutting the ties
It's time for the dissolution of the EAA and EMU's involvement
protesters and professors marched outside of Eastern Michigan
University's Welch Hall on Tuesday, calling for the school to end
its partnership with the Education Achievement Authority- a
program that forcibly takes control of the worst performing public schools
in Michigan. Since its inception, the EAA has been hugely controversial,
with opponents pointing out the undemocratic nature of taking over pub-
lic schools and placing them under the jurisdiction of an unelected body.
Some Michigan schools have refused to accept student teachers from
EMU out of discontent with the university's affiliation with the EAA. It's
time for the dissolution of the EAA, or at the very least, the termination of
EMU's involvement with it.

Established in 2011, the EAA identifies the
lowest performing 5 percent of schools in the
state and appropriates control of the school
to Detroit Public School Emergency Man-
ager Roy Roberts and a 11-member governing
board appointed by Governor Rick Snyder,
EMU and DPS. The EAA began its project
by taking over 15 schools in the DPS district.
Countless debates surrounding the EAA's
"educational program, accountability and
governance of the authority" led to a coalition
of parents and university professors to write
a letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan and President Barack Obama voicing
their concerns in December of 2012.
Being the only public university partnered
with the EAA, public schools in Michigan are
angered by EMU's unique relationship with
the controversial program. Led by chairman
Tim Hein, the Washtenaw County chapter of
the Michigan Education Association is boy-
cotting EMU student teachers in an effort
to coerce the school to abandon the partner-
ship. Hein explains that the EAA's primary
approach to improving schools to fire teach-
ers deemed inadequate through an evaluation
by their district. This is an overly simplistic
and unsustainable approach to improving
Michigan schools. Furthermore, the constant
staff turnover creates a tumultuous environ-
ment for students whose academic struggles
may be exacerbated by an unstable classroom.
Money spent on the EAA would be bet-
ter spent on long-term solutions like more
training for teachers and better resources for
students. The programs detract from local

control over schools, and in turn, the schools
have lost community support. Enrollment in
the schools has plummeted almost 25 percent.
Regardless of the progress the EAA says it's
making with students, if they are choosing not
to be educated through the system, these gains
are irrelevant.
A significant amount of these teachers are
replaced with volunteers from the Teach for
America program. This places young, inex-
perienced college graduates in difficult and
increasingly unstable situations. These new
teachers are asked to teach students in low-
income neighborhoods with higher-than-
average crime rates while simultaneously
dealing with the political controversy sur-
roundingthe EAA.
The WCEA's boycott against EMU and the
controversy surrounding the EAA directly
harms EMU and its students. Many professors
and department professionals are displeased
with EAA tactics and the fact that their input
is neither utilized nor valued. The growing
tension culminated in the protest organized
EMU's chapter of the American Association of
Teachers on Tuesday, Dec. 3. Despite faculty
ire, EMU spokesman.Geoff Larcom said in a
statement that the university intends to con-
tinue its partnership with the EAA.
The EAA takes a simplistic and detrimental
approach to fixingthe schools it commandeers.
Students at EMU and at EAA-run schools are
victims of this mismanagement. The program
should be ended. If state politics prevent the
EAA's dissolution, EMU should dissolve its
partnership.

arlier this week classic Amer-
ican rock-and-roll icon Bob
Dylan
was charged with
criminal "pub-
lic insult and
inciting hate" by
French authori-
ties for comments
he made in an
article published
Rolling Stone MAURA
magazine in LEVINE
September 2012.
Dylan's com-
ments, which offended not only
French authorities but also a Croa-
tian community group in France
were, "If you got a slave master or
Klan in your blood, Blacks can sense
that. That stuff lingers to this day.
Just like Jews can sense Nazi blood
and the Serbs can sense Croatian
blood." While these statements may
have been inflammatory, they were
made on American soil during an
interview conducted by an American
magazine. Dylan is protected under
the First Amendment to say what he
pleases. He can't possibly be subject
to criminal charges in another coun-
tryunder these circumstances.
In legal terms, jurisdiction is the
territory over which legal author-
ity-extends in any given area. In the
United States, there is both federal
criminal jurisdiction and state crimi-
nal jurisdiction depending on the
situation, the crime and the circum-
stances. For example, if someone
crosses state boarders with narcot-
ics, the federal government can file
charges against the carrier due to
federal interstate jurisdiction. The
person is then subject to different
and often greater penalties due to the
fact that the federal government is
involved, not just the state.
International jurisdiction has a
long historical background. Interna-
tionallaw only addresses questionsof
criminal issues and leaves civil issues
up to national jurisdiction. Accord-
ing to the Encyclopedia Britannica,
"the territorial principle" establishes
that, "states have exclusive author-

ity to deal with criminal issues aris-
ing in their territories." This means
that if the United States had deemed
Dylan's actions a criminal or civil
infraction, it would be under home-
land jurisdiction to charge him.
Interestingly enough, another policy,
called "universal jurisdiction, is
also in place, which grants states or
international organizations criminal
jurisdiction over an accused per-
son, regardless of where the person
is from or where the alleged crime
was committed. Based on this defini-
tion one may assume that Bob Dylan
could be subject to criminal jurisdic-
tion in France. The catch, however, is
that the only crimes that fall under
the category of universal jurisdiction
are "crimes against all," like interna-
tional terrorism or genocide. These
offenses are obviously much graver
than a few sentences in Rolling Stone.
Furthermore, in Article 689 of
the French penal code, France has
specifically outlined certain crimes
which fall under their jurisdiction
even when they were committed out-
side of French
territory. These
crimes include: P
torture, terror-
ism, nuclear the righ
smuggling, naval
piracy and air- offensiv(
plane hijacking.
other than that, and als
France does not
claim to have them if th
jurisdiction over_
people that are
not their citizens or over crimes that
were not committed on their terri-
tory. Unless Dylan was simultane-
ously hijacking a plane when these
statements were made, France has
already lost the battle here. They
simply do nothave the right to charge
him under the penal code.
The offended Croatian commu-
nity group in France has also filed a
lawsuit against Dylan, yet their law-
yer has reported that they are not
seeking monetary damages, just an
apology. Their lawyer commented
that he did not know why Croatians

in the United States have not filed
similar suits, based on the nature
of Dylan's comments. But being a
U.S. citizen and presumably. being
on American soil when he gave his
interview, Dylan is protected under
the First Amendment of the Consti-
tution, which guarantees his right
to free speech. While others may
argue that his words are not pro-
tected under the First Amendment
because they "incite an immedi-
ate breach of the peace" - which is
an accepted exception to the First
Amendment - this would be inaccu-
rate. While Dylan's words may have
offended some people, there is not
enough damage to sue him. This is
a grey area where people could pos-
sibly argue that his "personal attack"
on different ethnicities and minority
groups warrants a civil reprimand,
but this would be a stretch to say the
least.
It is important to recognize that
Bob Dylan's comments are disre-
spectfulto many people inthe French
nation, which is home to about
30,000 Croa-
tians who feel
.e have the very real and
recent effects

Croat conflict.
e things, But the beauty
of living in the
o ignore United States is
that freedom of
ley choose speech is pro-
tected. People
have the right
to say offensive things or prosely-
tize on a street corner because other
people have the right to ignore them
if they so choose. Bob Dylan was
making these crass statements to an
American magazine as a U.S. citizen
and therefore cannot be subject to
the jurisdiction of France's criminal
code. As George Orwell once said,
"If liberty means anything at all, it
means the right to tell people what
they do not wantto hear."

MAJA TOSK I

In every town in the United States you
will probably find at least one street called
Washington and possibly one public park or
school named after our 16th president, Abra-
ham Lincoln. But I have never seen anything
like South Africa's passion for their first Black
president, Nelson Mandela.
You can't drive more than five minutes
without passing a mall or shopping center
named for him, and you probably drove on
at least two Mandela Streets to get to those
centers. And this isn't in one city or even just
his hometown, but it's in every city over the
entire country.
During my time in South Africa, Mandela
was hovering somewhere between life and
death. As the country absorbed itself in prayer
and reflected on his legacy, his family - the
South African version of the Kardashians -
squabbled over his money and burial site.
I have never experienced the death of a
public political figure. I wasn't alive for the
assassinations of Martin Luther King or John
F. Kennedy. Yes, Ted Kennedy died in 2009,
but I wasn't aware of his prestige. The clos-
est were the deaths of Whitney Houston and
Michael Jackson, but these celebrity deaths
were unexpected and sudden. There was no
time for prayer or debate over property until
after the fact. Camera crews weren't set out-
side their houses like they were at Mandela's.
In South Africa, people came to pray or
leave gifts and well wishes outside his home
and they did the same later at the hospital.
There were days when people were sure he

was going to die and reporters flocked to his
house, unenthusiastically hopingto break the
story. During my lifetime, this waiting game
has never been played in the United States.
Mandela is seen as the heart and savior
of their country, despite being president just
over a decade ago. Since his presidency, there
have been very few politicians that South
Africa has to be proud-of. As one of the most
corrupt countries in the world, according to
Forbes Magazine, their political system is
more of a burden than a highlight. The end
of Mandela's presidency turned quickly into
police bribes and millions spent to pamper
the current president's cattle faster than any-
one could have predicted.
It has taken more than 100 years for the
Republican Party in the United States to adopt
values different from those held during the
Civil War. South Africa's African National Con-
gress has turned from freedom fighters into a
corrupt political party in fewer than 30 years.
The South African people still hold on to
Mandela because he is a reminder of what
South Africa was supposed to be after the end
of Apartheid. His death is not only a tragic
loss of a beloved and inspirational leader,
but end of the hope that Mandela could see
a South Africa free of its apartheid past.
Yes, segregation has ended in South Africa,
but Mandela died without seeing equality
between the Black and White populations in
all aspects of life.

World of hip hop moves

'Fast and Furious'
actor found dead
after car crash
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily B-Side Editor
There's something to be
said about "normality." Is it a
picket fence, closely surround-
ing the red brick houses that
float unnoticed on islands of
unkempt summer grass? Is it
those tired winter afternoons
spent racing down miounds
of snow next to the neighbor-
hood cul-de-sac? Or maybe the
crinkled ticket stubs you find in
your pockets after a night at the
movies. No one really knows.
But we all have ideas of what we
think - or Want - it to mean.
Paul Walker, who died in a
car crash last Saturday, saw nor-
mality in his daughter, Meadow.
She was unplanned, the first
taste of consequence in a life
of irrelevant one-night stands
and detached infidelities. It was
before his first real break in
Hollywood, before he became
the unassuming man who cat-
egorized his career with the
words, "I thought I'd make one
movie and be done, but I kept
working and now I'm 38 and
don't know what the fuck hap-
pened. That's it in a nutshell."
Initially, Walker turned away
from his responsibilities. He
chipped in financially, mailing
in a regular stream of checks
to his former girlfriend to make
sure Meadow wouldn't be in
need of the things he lacked
growing up, but he was never
there himself. He focused on
* his career, clinging to that tran-
sient lifestyle, "living out of
bags" and unable, even, to call
anywhere "home" until he was
32.
Things changed in 2011.
Nearly 40, Walker did what he'd
never considered before: He
moved in with his daughter. It
was a new challenge - the one
he felt he had spent his entire
adulthood working toward, and
for once, he was OK with being
grounded by the permanence.
It's a progression in personal-
ity peculiarly suggestive of the
franchise that made Walker a
household name. The roaring
cars, plumes of nitrous exhaust
and vibrant, over-the-top story-
* lines sold the tickets, but "Fast
and Furious" 's beating heart
was always family - the brief
reaffirmation of brotherhood
that came with looking out the
passenger window and being
able to lock eyes with people
4 who you knew would lie down
in traffic to protect you.
As the engines hummed
beneath the weight of those
neon-soaked nights, Brian
O'Conner became the closest
thing a big-budgeted, "dumb"

summer extravaganza could
afford to relatable dynamic-
ity. Dom was unmoving - a
monolithic dedication to honor,
paternalistically guiding how
the story unfolded, but it was
Walker's easy blue eyes and
patent accessibility that let the
films distance themselves from
hollowness.
It wasn't that we could never
tell what he'd do next - every
character in the "Fast and Furi-
ous" universe except, perhaps,
Hobbs, is a beacon of predict-
ability - it's just that he made
it seem normal. No matter how
cheesy or overblown the lines
may have looked on paper, he
spoke them with an odd sto-
icism ringing of the endurance
that comes hand-in-hand with
experience. There was a visible
calmness in that experience, a
calmness that cut through the
bombastically fiery explosions
and unnecessarily loud plot
twists at every turn.
Yet, it's intriguing to note
how it wasn't always that way.
"The Fast and the Furious,"
the first film in the franchise,
features an obviously young-
er Walker whose character
approaches his surroundings
with a high-pitched innocence
that's invisible in the later
installments. The lines aren't
much different; still short,
plain, to-the-point statements
of fact that never once approach
the flowery monologues about
the meaning of life and fam-
ily we see Vin Diesel spewing
every 30 minutes.

But in those first two films,
hearing Walker's delivery is like
being hit by the new-car smell
of a Mustang you just drove off
the lot. The persistent traces of
potential are there, but what
you remember are the swerv-
ing fluctuations in emotion
that Walker dampens by the
time "Fast 5" and "Fast 6" roll
around.
In that change, there's the
unavoidable recognition that,
like his character, he's finally at
peace with the life he's chosen
for himself. Each movie is still
arace, the exaggerated depic-
tion of a struggle to find some
trace of stability in life. But
O'Conner's journey is our own.
He's fighting to make a place for
himself in a world completely
defined by the finish line.
And in that last scene of "Fast
6," sitting around a table of food
with the people he calls his
closest friends, we get an idea
of what that means. He never
planned on being a family man.
It just happened. He chose the
people he let into his world, and
in doing so, found the calmness
he'd spent an entire lifetime
struggling to accept. The jok-
ing blue eyes and smirking grin
didn't look out of place any-
more. They had endured.
. O'Conner, like Walker, found
meaning. It doesn't really mat-
ter what it was - skids of
burned tire marks stretched
across the expressway or a
daughter he could finally call
his own. Because it was his. His
normality.

Today, it seems like anyone
can record a few verses in his or
her spare time, upload them to
YouTube and dub themselves a
"rapper." Some people love this;
some don't. Some retain tradi-
tional standards that newcomers
must meet in order to be recog-
nized as rappers, while others
would describe Miley's verse on
"23" as rap - because, well, the
lines rhyme, she's talking about
Jordans and she mentioned a
'90s rap group (shout-out to
Naughty by Nature), and isn't
that enough?

'Frozen' will
warm your heart

Disney produces a
new take on typical
princess story
By KAREN YUAN
Daily Arts Writer
During the production process
of "Frozen," Disney assigned a
team of researchers and animal
behavior-
ists to study
a particular
species of Frozen
young adults
called Use- Walt Disney
rus Tumblrus Studios
and Readerus
Buzzfeedua. Rave and Qaaliyl16
After ana-
lyzing and
distilling every trait of these crea-
tures, the team threw them into a
blender. The result is "Frozen" 's
heroine Princess Anna (Kristen
Bell, "Safety Not Guaranteed"),
who appropriately freaks out,
trips and exudes quiet courage at
all the right moments - allowing
the movie's young target audience
to project themselves onto her as
much as possible.
She's spunky and independent,
her speech filled with, like, mod-
ern vernacular. She's also quirkily
obsessed with food, shoveling pas-
tries into her mouth at a ball i la
Jennifer Lawrence - patron saint
of teenage girls - eating McDon-
ald's at the Oscars. When in the
presence of a handsome prince,
she stutters and becomes endear-
ingly awkward. This is Disney's
newspinonthe old princess trope.
In the same vein, Disney sub-
verts the traditional fairytale
canon in the animated musical
"Frozen," directed by Chris Buck
("Tarzan"). The movie revolves
around two sisters, Princess Anna
and her older sister Elsa (Idina
Menzel, "Enchanted"), who com-
plements her frostier personality
with the power to control ice and
snow. On her Coronation Day,
Elsa accidentally unleashes her
powers on the entire Kingdom of

Sunny' a dark delight

Always a princess, never an ice queen.
Arendelle, dousing it in eternal
winter as she flees in fear. Anna
embarks on a journey with moun-
taineer Kristoff (Jonathan Groff,
"C.O.G.") and sentient snowman
Olaf (Josh Gad, "Jobs") to find her
sister, who she loves despite their
strained relationship.
This is where the movie diverg-
es from a typical fairytale. There is
no clear delineation of good versus
evil, no Dorothy pitted against the
Wicked Witch. Elsa is a refresh-
ingly reluctant villain. Anna's
spontaneous engagement to the
mysterious Prince Hans (Santino
Fontana, "Nancy, Please") is a
typical, Cinderella-esque arche-
type contested by Kristoff, who
asks her the important questions:
"What if you hate the way he eats?
What if you find out that he picks
his nose? And eats the boogers?"
"Frozen" sets itself apart from
any other Disney princess movie
through one last trope inversion:
Only true love can break a fatal
spell, but it's not the conventional
love which the audience is led to
believe. In the past, Disney has

moved toward a modern take on
fairytales - 2007's "Enchanted"
for example, addresses true love's
kiss - but "Frozen" goes above
and beyond its duty with a major
twist. Hint: Girl-power advocates
everywhere are cheering.
From a more traditional stand-
point, "Frozen" 's animation
shines despite its limited palette
of snow, ice and more snow. Watch
this movie if only for the stunning
wintry landscapes, especially in
3-D. There are also a few Eas-
ter eggs that nod to '90s Disney
classics, including "Mulan" and
"Beauty and the Beast," to mol-
lify even the most ardent Disney
veterans.
The film is destined to go the
same way as "Beauty" and become
a Broadway musical. "Frozen"
delivers eight brand new songs,
from anthem pop to acoustic
duets, and though it oddly lacks a
finale number, the timeless Dis-
ney heart in each song more than
makes up for it. It's a slogan for
the whole movie: New look, same
great taste.

Never in a million years did I
think I'd be recommending peo-
ple to watch "It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia."
Just a few months ago, I
probably would have told you
that "Sunny" was brainless and
offensive. I'd seen the pilot epi-
sode a few years back, and wasn't
impressed: Within the first few
minutes, the "gang" of morally
repulsive bar owner buddies
had already demonstrated their
racism and homophobia, appar-
ently using these insensitive
jokes to garner cheap gasps, not
legitimate laughs. I ignored my
friends who recommended it to
me, because it seemed that only
a certain type of person liked
the show, anyway (the fans'
personalities tended to be eerily
similar to those of the gang!).
But more recently, a friend
described "It's Always Sunny in
Philadelphia" to me as the scum-
my cousin of "Arrested Develop-
ment." This comment piqued my
interest: Family comedies are

Late collapse dooms Wolverines For Larkin, a game of stress

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
In an exhibition against the
U.S. Under-18 National Team
Development Program, Michigan
hockey coach Red Berenson gave
the starting nod to the trio of for-
mer NTDP USNTDP 5
players MICHIGAN 4
that helped
upset the
Wolverines last season with a
combined five points.
Freshmen forwards Evan
Allen, JT Compher and Tyler
Motte comprise that standout
trio, and Allen and Motte record-
ed three total points in the first
period. But after a third-period
collapse, Michigan fell 5-4 in
overtime Thursday at Yost Ice
Arena.
The NTDP scored the first goal
of the game thanks to an odd-man
rush that left forward Jack Eichel
open in the slot, where he buried
a shot past freshman goaltender
Zach Nagelvoort.
There wasn't much Nagelvoort
could do on Eichel's shot, though
he stood strong between the pipes
the rest of the evening, making
22 total sages on 24 shots before
being replaced by redshirt junior
goaltender Luke Dwyer with less
than three minutes to play.
The captains had talked to
Berenson earlier this week about
getting Dwyer, who had never
seen the ice before for Michigan,
in the game if the team had a late
lead. All went according to plan,
except earning the victory. The
Wolverines gave up two goals
in the final minute, and a third
straight Michigan collapse late in
the third period finally came back
to bite the Wolverines.
"Dwyer earned that opportu-
nity," said junior forward Alex
Guptill. "He's been our hardest
worker here for the last two years,
and he has nothing to show for it.
Ihave asickfeelinginmystomach
for us to blow that lead for him."

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Freshman foward Evan Allen scored two goals in Thursday's loss.

The late tallies came from for-
ward Shane Gersich at the right
circle with 52 seconds to play and
Ryan Hitchcock with 23 seconds
left on a wrap-around to bring
new life to the NTDP.
Both goals came from defen-
sive miscues, and not specifically
because of Dwyer's lack of game
experience. Gersich was wide
open when he netted his goal, and
thegame-tyingscore happened as
a NTDP player was pushed into
Dwyer in the closing moments.
And with all the momentum,
the NTDP tallied the game-win-
ner with 2:17 to play in overtime.
Forward Alex Tuch was left
unmarked from the point, and
he ripped a shot that beat Dwyer
on his glove side. Just like that, in
four minutes and 35 seconds, the
NTDP had flipped the switch to
complete the upset over Michigan
for the second season ina row.
After the game, sophomore
forward Andrew Copp's chin was
glued to his hand, his face red
and his eyes focused on one spot
downward. He hardly looked up
at all, even to answer questions.
"Anytime you blow a two-goal
lead like that it's kind of sicken-
ing," Copp said.
The word "devastating" was
used by Motte this week in prac-
tice to describe what a loss would
feel like to the NTDP. No one
knew it'd feel like this, though.

The Wolverines led comfort-
ably before the collapse.Allen net-
ted two goals in the initial frame
less than three minutes apart.
The exhibition served as an
opportunity for Berenson to
experiment with some lines. In
doing so, he gave upperclassmen
like senior captain Mac Bennett
and junior forward Derek DeBlois
the night off.
Despite the unfamiliar lineup,
Michigan seemed to click offen-
sively for much of the night,
coasting behind four goals from
freshmen. However, the third
straight, late-game collapse -
dating back to last weekend's
sweep over Ohio State - proved
to be too costly this time.
"For this to keep happen-
ing is unacceptable," Copp said.
"There's no excuse for us to be
blowing leads like this. We're sup-
posed to be a defensively sound
team, and it cannot just keep hap-
pening. We just need to be able to
bear down and finish games."
Guptill and Copp weren't the
only ones feeling the ill effects of
a heartbreaking loss. Allen, Com-
pher and Motte are the ones who
now understand how they left the
Wolverines feeling last season. It
doesn't even matter that it was an
exhibition, because pride was still
on the line.
Copp's body language

Dylan Larkin's name echoed
across Yost Ice Arena with the
lights dimmed and the crowd
silent. Unhurried and relaxed,
Larkin coasted up to the blue
line, glancing at himself on the
screen.
He surveyed the crowd
ambling in, first right, then left
and then straight ahead at the
No. 3 Michigan hockey team
lined up across the ice.
The video screen went black,
and then the video started. The
pictures of Yost flew across, the
bells toiled in the background as
the voice reminded fans of the
nine national championships
and 24 Frozen Fours in program
history.
Larkin leaned over to his
teammates with a smile and
then watched as the Wolverines
were announced.
The forward from Waterford,
Mich. has been here before. The
U.S. National Team Develop-
ment Program Under-18 team
travels around the country to
play teams, from NCAA Division
I to the United States Hockey
League, throughout the season.
But Thursday in Ann Arbor
was different. Michigan wasn't
just another team. This was
the team that he had signed his
letter of intent with less than a
month earlier and had commit-
ted to over a year ago.
This was a chance to make an
impression in front of his future
coach, Red Berenson.
But in his first action at Yost,
Larkin's nerves got the best of
him.
He couldn't handle the puck
as effectively as some experts
say he is capable of. He looked
winded for someone his coach
called a "great skater." Nor did
he put up any points after tal-
lying 22 - 14 goals and eight
assists - in 23 games prior to

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
U.S. NTDP forward Dylan Larkin is Michigan's top-rated commit in 2014-15.

Thursday.
"You want to come in here
and make a good first impres-
sion in front of coach Berenson
and the fans and all that," said
NTDP Under-18 coach Danton
Cole. "That's a guy who is nor-
mally pretty calm and cool and
collected."
His team won regardless of
his performance, earning a.5-4
overtime victory after trailing
by two with three minutes in the
third.
In one of his early shifts on
the ice, Larkin was sent to the
penalty box for interference,
and nearly one minute later, he
skated out with his head down
to the bench after a Michigan
goal.
Afterward, Larkin waited to
return to the ice, then chased
the puck, a chip on his shoul-
der and pressure to produce.
Larkin skates better than any of
his teammates. One minute he's
buried in the corner, the next
he's on the other side of the ice,
looking to gather the loose puck.

"We tried to get him out on
the ice as much as we could,"
Cole said. "And that was easy
because he's a great player."
Larkin never stopped moving
in the game, even if he did move
slower on some shifts. He scuf-
fled with freshman defenseman
Michael Downing, and he was
there to push the puck for the
third goal.
Underneath his helmet, Lar-
kin smiled after the tally. This
was how he envisioned things
going.
When Larkin finished talk-
ing with the media, after he had
shaken the hands of parents and
friends waiting to see him, he
stood near the ice. Freshman
forward JT Compher, a prod-
uct of the NTDP, walked over
to Larkin, both dressed in their
suits. Smiles lit their faces, and
they laughed. Compher talked
while he put his arm around
Larkin for a moment.
"You're going to love him,"
Cole said just moments earlier.
The Wolverines already do.


'M' wins on the road

Wolverines conclude semester

By SHANNON LYNCH

Thursday night in Charlottes-
ville, Va., the Michigan women's
basketball team fought for more
than just the block 'M.' Repre-
senting their conference in the
Big Ten/ACC Women's Basket-
ball Challenge, the Wolverines
used effective shooting to up
their record
to 3-0 in MICHIGAN 73
away games VIRGINIA 53
with a 73-53
victory over Virginia at John
Paul Jones Arena.
Making it nearly impossible
to tell that this team returned
just 11.6 percent of its scoring
from last season and was play-
ing without junior guard Shan-
non Smith, its leading scorer,
seven different Michigan players
scored. The Wolverines were led
by junior forward Cyesha Goree,
who recorded a career-high 20
points. Not far behind was soph-
omore guard Madison Ristovski
with 13 points and junior guard
Nicole Elmblad with 12.
"I think that speaks volumes,
especially without Shannon
being here, that other people
are contributing," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "If you
told me that we would be up 16
at half, I would have been in dis-
belief"
The win put another notch in
Michigan's belt in the event, as
it has the best record of any Big
Ten team participating in the
Big Ten/ACC Challenge, going
5-2 all-time.
Michigan (6-3) looked solid
in the first 20 minutes of play
and headed to halftime with a
16-point lead over the Cavaliers
(3-5). Goree put the Wolverines
on the board first with a jump
shot, and after Elmblad posted
her own first bucket four min-
utes in, Michigan never relin-
quished its lead.
The Wolverines shot 54 per-
cent from the floor and never
gave Virginia a chance, add-
ing nine more points in the first
three minutes of the second
half. Ristovski led the team in
assists with nine and recorded
13 points, going 6-for-6 on free

For the Daily
As the semester winds down,
the Michigan baseball team's
preparation for the upcoming sea-
son is rampingup.
With the season two months
away, the coaches are placing
extra emphasis on individual fit-
ness and player development.
"Right now, we're in a period
where our time is very precious
and valuable," said Michigan
coach Erik Bakich. "We don't have
much of it with the team, so we're
really focused on individual play-
er development. We're not doing
as many team-specific drills. It's
more working with the players
one-on-one and in small groups."
The team ends the semester
this week with the Omaha Chal-
lenge, its annual week of intense
strength and conditioning, named
after the site of the College World
Series.

"This is a period of the year
where there's a huge commit-
ment to strength and conditioning
and getting the players' bodies as
strong and physical as possible,"
Bakich said.
Players are pushed to theirlimit
all week in events like the mile run
or obstacle courses where they
have to do things like push the
John Deere Gator vehicle 50 yards
and army crawl through ice water.
At the end of the week, play-
ers are not only physically stron-
ger, but mentally, too. The whole
team is split up into smaller teams
that compete against one another
throughoutthe week.
"This week, in particular, I feel
is a great way to prepare for our
upcoming season," said fifth-year
senior pitcher Ben Ballantine. "I
think it's symbolic in the sense
that you're never out of it. If your
team has a bad day or even a bad
event, there's another day full of
new challenges right around the

corner."
One of the goals of the week is
to simulate the effects of a long
baseball season. Even though the
players are competing against
each other, the idea is that they
will become closer since they all
went through a week that few
other programs put their players
through.
"Guys are going to struggle
physically and mentally at some
point in the week, just like they
will during the course of a baseball
season, and it's imperative that as
a unit we pick them up and keep
pressing forward."
The Omaha Challenge con-
cludes Friday, and after that, play-
ers follow their own individual
workout plans during final exams
and winter break. Practice will
start back up the third week in
January when the team will have
just a month before its season
starts on Valentine's Day in the
Texas State Tournament.

throws.
Coming off a huge game
against No. 15 LSU last week,
senior forward Val Driscoll took
Smith's place and impressed
once again. She recorded a
career-high 12 points with five
rebounds and two assists and
didn't miss a shot all night.
"She had a heck of a game
tonight, and she's just getting
more and more confident as
the season progresses," Barnes
Arico said. "She's not just out
there holding time for somebody
else while they are getting their
rest. She is out there being a
major contributor on our team."
The Wolverines out-rebound-
ed the Cavaliers, 41-27, and
forced nine turnovers. Barnes
Arico kept Elmblad on the bench
for the last six minutes. Elmblad
averages 38.6 minutes per game,
so Barnes Arico wanted to give
her the chance to rest as the
clock ran down.

A number of younger players
helped Michigan to its domi-
nant victory, including freshmen
guards Siera Thompson and
Paige Rakers. Though Thomp-
son only recorded three points
in the game, she matched her
career high in assists with eight.
Rakers also gotcontheboard with
five points and four rebounds.
Freshman guard Danielle
Williams, who returned to
action over Thanksgiving in
Brooklyn, N.Y. after suffering a
broken finger in preseason work-
outs, looked confident against
the Cavaliers. She went 2-for-2
from the field, both on 3-point-
ers, and added two free throws,
totaling eight points.
"When people needed a break,
she had to go in and contribute.
So it's kind of learning on the
job," Barnes Arico said. "So we
were so happy for her to be able
to make those shots and really
play big minutes for us."

In need of offensive tuning, Michigan to host Houston Baptist

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
On Tuesday night, Duke pro-
vided each of the Michigan men's
basketball team's future oppo-
nents a road
map to stymie- Houston
ing the Wolver-B
ines.
The Blue Michigan
Devils denied Matchup:

an injury-short- BTN
ened four-min-
ute outing last
year, his two field-goal attempts
-both misses -matched a career
low. Though his sprained ankle
likely played a factor in Duke's
ability to stifle him, the Wolver-
ines looked lost on offense with-
out his production and ability to
create space, much like in the loss
to Charlotte in the Puerto Rico
Tip-Off championship game.
But Saturday's opponent,
Houston Baptist, should be noth-
ing more than a minor speed
bump - effective Stauskas or not.
No. 22 Michigan, which hasn't

that other option out there."
After struggling with consis-
tency in San Juan, LeVert reas-
serted himself as a viable option
in perhaps the nation's toughest
environment.
But the Wolverines' ceiling
hinges on sophomore forward
Mitch McGary perhaps more
than anyone else. McGary had
one of his best statistical games
this season in Durham, scor-
ing 15 points and collecting 14
rebounds, but much of his pro-
duction came after the game's
outcome had already been
decided. While his work in the
post was at times unstoppable
against Duke - he shot 6-for-10,
including two missed jumpers
that frustrated Beilein - Michi-
gan continued to struggle to find
ways to involve him in its offen-
sive game plan.
Last year, McGary's produc-
tion exploded in the NCAA Tour-
nament thanks to the respect
garnered by Trey Burke's pick-
and-roll offense. While McGary
has had success in the pick-and-
roll when it has been used in
spots this year, no point guard
on this year's roster can run the
play to the extent that last year's
consensus National Player of
the Year could. Saturday's game
is one of the Wolverines' final
chances to experiment with new
ways to get him the ball.

Sophomore forward Mitch McGary scored 15 points and grabbed 14 rebounds against Duke, but much of that production came with the game out of reach.

lost a non-conference home game
since Jan. 9, 2011, should have no
problem pushing the tempo and
scoring in bunches against its
Southland Conference opponent.
In two matchups against BCS-
conference opponents this year,
the 3-5 Huskies lost by a com-
bined 42 points and needed a sec-
ond-half push to beat Crowley's
Ridge, a program in the National
Christian College Athletic Asso-
ciation.
Michigan coach John Beilein

said after the Duke game that he
wasn't sure whether Stauskas's
ineffectiveness was more a prod-
uct of the guard's ankle injury or
just a well-crafted, well-execut-
ed game plan by the Blue Devils.
And though the Wolverines have
a full week off following Satur-
day's game, Beilein may opt to
limit Stauskas's minutes in prep-
aration for likely-No. 1 Arizona,
which will play in Ann Arbor a
week from Saturday.
But in one of its final tune-ups

before Big Ten play picks up in
January, Michigan (5-3) needs
to find alternative ways to gener-
ate offense when the team, and
especially Stauskas, struggles
to knock down 3-pointers. The
Wolverines shot just 3-of-13 from
deep on Tuesday.
"We just had trouble scoring
without (Stauskas)," Beilein said.
"The first half was really bad
offensively."
Thus far, the team's second-
ary option has been sophomore

guard Caris LeVert, who explod-
ed in the second half en route to
a game-high 24 points. Despite
shooting just 3-for-16 from
3-point range in his past four
games, LeVert - the team's sec-
ond-leadingscorer, averaging15.1
points per game - still displayed
an impressive ability to create his
own offense, repeatedly getting
into the lane and to the charity
stripe, where he was 7-for-7.
"He's growing every day,"
Beilein said. "It's good to have
