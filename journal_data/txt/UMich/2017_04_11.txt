Federal Reserve Chairwoman 

Janet Yellen conversed with 
economist Susan M. Collins, 
dean of the Ford School of Public 
Policy, about her experience 
as the leader of multiple public 
policy initiatives to a packed 
Rackham Auditorium Monday 
night. 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

introduced 
Yellen, 
outlining 

the importance of the Federal 
Reserve to the University of 
Michigan, specifically the Public 
Policy School, which hosted the 
event. Regents Kathy White, 
Andrew Richner and Ron Weiser 
were also in attendance.

“The University of Michigan’s 

academic strength is further 
enhanced by the Ford School’s 
connections 
to 
the 
Federal 

Reserve,” Schlissel said. “Many 
UM students and graduates have 
interned or worked at the Fed.”

Yellen then launched into her 

discussion, starting with her 
experience in carrying out the 
dual mandate Congress places 
on the reserve: to uphold low 
and stable inflation rates and to 
maximize employment.

Yellen 
said 
the 
current 

economy, 
in 
comparison 
to 

the economy during the 2008 
recession, is relatively healthy.

“In 
terms 
of 
the 
goals 

Congress has assigned us, we’re 
doing pretty well,” she said. “The 
economy is growing at a moderate 
pace, 
mostly 
supported 
by 

consumer spending. But housing 
is a little bit healthier than it’s 
been, investment spending that 
had been quite weak last year is 
showing greater strength and the 
global economy, which was quite 
weak, now seems to be operating

In LSA freshman Ashley 

Soto’s hometown of Livonia, 
the University of Michigan is 
not always a feasible option 
for high-school seniors. With 
an average in-state tuition 
rate of $28,776 per year, 
Soto said most lower-income 
students don’t even consider 
the University when applying 
to colleges.

“Coming from the west 

side of the state, Michigan 
is not a name you hear very 
often,” Soto said. “It’s mostly 
Grand 
Valley 
and 
Ferris 

State University … I think 
the biggest thing that scares 
people is the price tag … I 
actually have friends who 
I encouraged to apply to 
become freshmen next year 
and even teachers told them 
not to because they didn’t 
think they would make it.”

LSA freshman Daija White 

did not consider the University 
as her first choice either when 
applying to colleges last year. 
She could have gone across 

the border to Canada as a dual 
citizen, and would have likely 
paid much less for her degree. 
However, when she received 
an 
advertisement 
in 
the 

mail for the High Achieving 
Involved Leaders Scholarship, 
she said her thoughts about 
the University and her future 
changed.

“I had already known I was 

going to apply to the college,” 
White 
said. 
“It 
definitely 

wasn’t my first choice but 
I had known I was going to 
apply and at least see what the 
outcome was … (HAIL) was a 
large part of it.”

On April 10, nearly one month 

after finishing his 33rd season as 
head coach of the Michigan hockey 
team, Red Berenson announced he 
would be retiring. 

“I’ve thought about this for a long 

time and I think this is the right 
time and it’s the right thing to do 
for the Michigan hockey program,” 
Berenson said in a press release 
Monday. “My heart will always 
be at Michigan and I look forward 
to the team taking the next step 
and making me proud as a former 
coach.” 

Added athletic director Warde 

Manuel: 
“Red 
Berenson 
is 
a 

legendary figure at the University 
of Michigan as well as in our ice 
hockey history. Throughout his 
career, Red has focused on the 
academic and athletic success of the 
young men who have come through 
our program while shaping the 
sport as we know it today. He has 
developed an astounding 73 NHL 
players but, more importantly, he 
has positively impacted hundreds 
of young men. We are forever 
grateful for his contributions to the 
University of Michigan and I look 
forward to continuing working with 
Red for years to come.”

Berenson 
has 
pondered 

retirement in recent years. He 
said Monday that he had received 
questions on the recruiting trail 
about his future and how long he 
planned on coaching. It bothered 
him, he admitted, that it was an 
issue, and it played a part in his 
conversation about retirement with 
Warde Manuel last year.

The 
original 
plan 
was 
for 

Berenson to step down following 
last season. But Manuel was still 
settling down into his new job — 
according to Berenson, he hadn’t 
even moved to Ann Arbor yet. 
The new athletic director coaxed 
Berenson into staying, and so began 
the last year of his career in Ann 
Arbor.

And what a career it was: to trace 

its outline with each of its stops is 
to follow the history of the sport 
— and even history itself. To put 
the longevity of Berenson’s term at 
Michigan into context, the last time 
the Wolverines took the ice without 
him behind the bench was during 
the Cold War, with Ronald Reagan 
serving as president of the United 
States.

Many fine players have filed 

in and out of Ann Arbor over the 
years, doing their part to fill the 
trophy cases and bring glory to the 
program. Yet it is Berenson’s name 
that has become synonymous with 
‘Michigan hockey’ — and rightfully 
so.

Berenson 
himself 
was 
once 

the star on ice, playing for the 
Wolverines 
for 
three 
seasons 

between 1959 and 1962. He enjoyed 
an illustrious career in the NHL, 
becoming one of the league’s first 
expansion stars as it doubled in 
size during the late 1960s. Once his 
playing career ended, he became a 
coach for the St. Louis Blues — the 
team he had become famous playing 
for — and won coach of the year in 
just his second season. In 1984, he 
returned to his alma mater, where 
he would remain for the duration of 
his career.

It took longer for Berenson to 

achieve success in the collegiate 
ranks. Michigan, once mighty but 
since humbled, was in dire straits. 
It had been nearly a decade since 
the 
team 
experienced 
its 
last 

postseason success, and the onus 
was on Berenson to rebuild the 
program. It was no easy task. To 
begin his tenure, he endured three 
consecutive losing seasons. He took 
another step forward once the team 
was full of players he had recruited, 
leading the team to three straight 
winning seasons — but with zero 
NCAA Tournament appearances.

The final breakthrough occurred 

in Berenson’s seventh year. The 
Wolverines 
recorded 
over 
30 

wins for the first time in school 
history and finished as an NCAA

RED BERENSON RETIRES

 
FOLLOWING 33 YEARS AT MICHIGAN, FAMED 

HOCKEY COACH ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen talks with Susan Collins, Dean of the Ford School, as part of the 
Ford Policy Talks series at Rackham Auditorium on Monday.


Heather Ann Thompson, a 

professor of history in the Afro-

American and African Studies 

Department, was awarded a Pulitzer 

Prize in history for her novel “Blood 

in the Water: The Attica Prison 

Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy.” 

In an email interview, 

Thompson — who is also in the 

Residential College Social Theory 

and Practice Program — wrote she 

found out about her award during 

class and looked at her students in 

disbelief.

“I am so deeply grateful for 

this, it’s hard to put into words,” 

she wrote. “It is amazing to have 

one’s work recognized for sure, 

but, mostly and overwhelmingly, I 

am grateful because the story of all 

that the men inside of Attica really 

endured back in 1971 — prisoners and 

guards alike — is being honored.”

In a University of Michigan 

press release, President Mark 

Schlissel said the award shows how 

dedicated University faculty are to 

their work.

“Dr. Heather Ann Thompson’s 

Pulitzer Prize in history is an 

outstanding example of our faculty’s 

talent and commitment to academic 

rigor being recognized at the highest 

levels,” he said. “I am proud to 

congratulate her on this amazing 

achievement.”

Thompson’s book highlights the 

Sept. 9, 1971 incident, in which nearly 

1,300 prisoners took over the prison 

and held guards and employees 

hostage to bargain for better living 

conditions. The takeover lasted four 

days and ended when New York state 

troopers shot and killed 39 prisoners 

and hostages and injured hundreds 

of others.

After the demonstration, the 

state of New York tried only the 

prisoners and did not provide any 

legal or financial support to the 

families of victims or survivors.

In her novel, Thompson 

recounts the demonstration and the 

aftermath and places the event in the 

context of the civil rights movements 

in the United States.

“Drawing from more than 

a decade of extensive research, 

historian Heather Ann Thompson 

sheds new light on every aspect of 

the uprising and its legacy, giving 

voice to all those who took part in 

this forty-five-year fight for justice: 

prisoners, former hostages, families 

of the victims, lawyers and judges, 

and state officials and members 

of law enforcement,” Thompson’s 

publisher wrote.

A New York Times review 

by Mark Oppenheimer wrote 

Thompson made the entire event 

thought-provoking by focusing on 

the inmate conditions and smaller 

details of the uprising that many 

would never consider.

Representatives 
from 
the 

University of Michigan Ginsberg 
Center presented on their new 
efforts to improve community 
outreach at the weekly Monday 
meeting of the Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs. SACUA also appointed 
its next vice chair, discussed the 
possibility of “immediate past 
chair” as a sanctioned position and 
passed a resolution supporting 
faculty education on student 
mental health.

Ginsberg Director Mary Jo 

Callan said the Ginsberg Center, 
which will be celebrating its 20th 
anniversary next month, has 
undergone a strategic planning 
process to contemplate its future 
efforts regarding its mission of 

community-engaged learning.

“What does the University need 

us to be now?” she said. “We have 
a rich history, we are an endowed 
center, we’re an important asset to 
the University, but what is needed 
now, 20 years later?”

As a part of the strategic 

planning, 
Callan 
said 
the 

center spoke with faculty and 
community leaders and received 
fairly consistent feedback on 
certain 
topics, 
including 
the 

need to educate students before 
embarking 
on 
community 

projects.

“What we heard: One, we 

need to do more to prepare 
students before they engage with 
the community, really helping 
students understand their own 
identities, where they fit in, their 
own power and privilege,” she 
said. “Because when they go into 
communities, and especially social 

sector organizations … they’re 
disproportionately working with 
folks who are marginalized and 
our students disproportionately 
are not.”

Callan said other areas of 

concern 
included 
cultivating 

and 
maintaining 
relationships 

between 
faculty 
members 

and 
community 
leaders 
and 

facilitating 
these 
connections 

between 
the 
University 
and 

community organizations.

“We’re not trying to be the only 

door; we want to be a clear door in 
and out of the University,” Callan 
said.

Additionally, Callan noted many 

community and faculty members 
felt the center prioritized student 
needs over the center’s needs in 
the past, which she explained 
they hope to avoid in the future 
through renewed efforts.

In 
conjunction 
with 
this 

feedback, the Ginsberg Center 
has 
recently 
hired 
Neeraja 

Aravamudan as the assistant 
director for engaged learning 
with a primary focus on balancing 
community 
engagement. 

Aravamudan 
was 
also 
in 

attendance at the meeting and 
explained how they strive to 
commit to all three components of 
the Ginsberg Center participation: 
students, faculty and community 
partners.

“One of the other things we’re 

doing and we’ve been doing is 
that in every place that we are, we 
mention all of them,” Aravamudan 
said. “One of the things that’s 
really been happening among 
our staff is having conversations 
across those people that are facing 
the different stakeholders. Our 
communication, no matter which 
one of us goes out, is that it’s a 
shared voice … We recognize that 
each stakeholder has different 
interests but that we need to be 
aware that they’re all at play.”

quarterfinalist, marking the 
beginning of a 22-year NCAA 
Tournament 
streak 
that 

remains the longest streak any 
team has ever put together in 
college hockey.

During 
that 
streak, 

Michigan made the Frozen 
Four 11 times, finishing as 
the 
runner-up 
once 
while 

collecting 
two 
national 

championships.

Berenson 
has 
left 
an 

enduring legacy not only with 
his achievements on the ice 
but off of it, as well. A graduate 
of the university’s Ross School 
of Business, Berenson has 
stressed the importance of 
education to all of his teams, 
priding himself on molding 
boys into men. Some of his 
players have even returned to 
the University after the end 
of their playing careers to 
take graduate classes — like 
Berenson once did. In recent 
years, he has sought to raise 
money 
and 
awareness 
for 

the cause of Scott Matzka, 
a former Wolverine who is 
currently fighting ALS.

Michigan 
will 
be 
in 

uncharted 
territory 
next 

year. 
This 
past 
year, 
the 

Wolverines struggled through 

their worst season in three 
decades, missing the NCAA 
Tournament for the third time 
in four years.

They will bring back the 

bulk of the team barring any 
unexpected early departures 
to the NHL, and may even 
have a new head coach with 
ties to the program — such 
as 
Michigan 
Tech’s 
Mel 

Pearson, a longtime assistant, 
or current assistants Billy 
Powers and Brian Wiseman. 
Berenson, in his new role as a 
special advisor to Manuel, will 
surely have a say in who his 
successor is, as well.

“I 
hope 
there’s 
some 

Michigan 
awareness 
or 

Michigan connection for a 
coach that will feel the right 
way about what a Michigan 
man should be like or what 
a Michigan team should be 
like,” Berenson said. “We’ve 
got some of those coaches here 
today, and we’ve got some 
great alumni here today. I’m 
sure Warde will make the 
right decision. It might be 
an easy decision, it might not 
be. We’re going to get a lot of 
people interested.”

But regardless of any ties 

the new coach might have 
to the program, things will 
undoubtedly feel different.

It is the end of an era and oh, 

what an era it was.

how this membrane plays a 
role in protein aggregation, 
that would lead to different 
types of aggregated species,” 
Ramamoorthy said. “Before they 
go into needle-like structures, 
you see that plaque. Needle-like 
structures are not toxic, but 
the intermediate structures are 
the most toxic species. So my 
research has been investigating 
this intermediate species. We 
would like to know their high-
resolution structure, at what 
times they can form, how 
they execute cell membrane 
toxicity, so that we can develop 
compounds to incubate this 

kind of toxicity. And they may 
become potential drugs to treat 
disease, or they would aid in the 
design of compounds to treat 
these diseases.”

Ramamoorthy 
also 

discovered these proteins can 
punch holes in the membrane, 
which is the second mechanism 
they have found to cause this 
cell death and memory loss.

“It 
is 
like 
a 
tornado,” 

Ramamoorthy 
described. 

“When a tornado comes, the 
buildings get destroyed, and 
when the protein aggregates 
like a tornado, it just rips out 
the whole cell membrane.”

While the research team 

is 
focused 
particularly 
on 

Alzheimer’s due to the grant 
they received, they have also 

discovered proteins that could 
tell more about Type 2 diabetes, 
AIDS and bone diseases.

Mi Hee Lim, an associate 

professor of chemistry at the 
Ulsan National Institute of 
Science and Technology in 
Korea, wrote in an email stating 
she thought the diversity of 
backgrounds in this team had 
a big effect on making this 
discovery.

“This 
research 

field 
absolutely 
needs 

multidisciplinary 
approaches 

in order to identify such a big 
question,” Lim wrote. “Working 
with this team has been very 
fruitful to verify challenging 
questions 
in 
Alzheimer’s 

disease.”

Magdalena 
Ivanova, 

an 
assistant 
professor 
of 

neurology and biophysics and 
a member of Ramamoorthy’s 
research team, said while she 
is more of a biochemist, her 
expertise 
complements 
that 

of Ramamoorthy. Ivanova has 
no 
personal 
connection 
to 

Alzheimer’s, but she believes 
Alzheimer’s and other diseases 
caused by aging should be 
things of public concern by all. 

“Most 
aging 
people 
are 

developing Alzheimer’s disease, 
more or less,” Ivanova said. 
“So the longer you live, your 
chances increase significantly. 
So with the increased lifespan, 
everybody starts to worry about 
these things.”

Ramamoorthy 
does 
not 

have a personal connection 

to Alzheimer’s either, but his 
father did suffer from Type 
2 diabetes, which served as a 
personal motivation for him.

“I’m 
very 
interested 
in 

brain-related 
diseases,” 

Ramamoorthy said. “We are 
living in an electronic world, 
but nature has chosen the brain 
to 
control 
everything. 
And 

the brain is so complicated, 
so 
contributing 
towards 

understanding 
of 
these 

molecule events that disrupt 
the brain is exciting.”

Ramamoorthy was excited 

about these new developments, 
but acknowledged there is still 
a great deal of work to be done 
in understanding the brain.

“I wish a day would come 

where we could clean up our 

brain the same way you clean 
up your body,” Ramamoorthy 
said. “We could go where the 
proteins are aggregated and put 
the brain back.”

Ramamoorthy laughed, and 

said hope is “like a science-
fiction.”

Ivanova shared a similar 

sentiment, 
saying 
there 
is 

still a long way to go in terms 
of creating a drug to combat 
Alzheimer’s. 

“Drugs are not so simple,” 

Ivanova said. “I think this is a 
big step forward to finding a 
cure, or knowing what to target 
and what to modify, so in that 
respect I’m optimistic that this 
could lead to a drug, or at least 
finding a good target to develop 
a drug.”

diversity at the University, and 
has been lauded multiple times 
by University President Mark 
Schlissel.

The scholarship is valued at 

about $60,000. According to a 
University press release, 262 
HAIL recipients enrolled at 
the University in 2015. Some 
of those students, however, say 
they remain estranged from 
the larger campus community.

White said when she told one 

of her classmates in high school 
about how she was awarded 
the scholarship, he said it was 
only because she was Black and 
of lower socioeconomic status. 
Even though White knew this 
wasn’t entirely true, she could 
not find any solace while at the 
University to prove her former 
classmate wrong.

“In the effort to become 

more diversified, they’ve … 
alienated people at the same 
time,” White said.

Students 
from 
higher 

socioeconomic 
levels 
are 

currently 
disproportionately 

represented in the University’s 
undergraduate student body. 
As 
originally 
reported 
by 

the Equality of Opportunity 
Project, the median family 
income of a student at the 
University is $154,000 and 1 
in 10 students are from the 
top 1 percent of the income 
distribution — the University 
ranked last in social mobility 
among elite public colleges. 

In response to criticism 

about the University’s lack 
of 
socioeconomic 
diversity, 

Kedra 
Ishop, 
vice 
provost 

for enrollment management, 
said the HAIL Scholarship is 
one way to help low-income 
students choose the University.

“We 
started 
this 
pilot 

scholarship to recruit … a 
group of low-income students 
from Michigan with … a pretty 
detailed 
communication 

packet that goes to the student, 
that goes to the student’s 
influencers — meaning the 

parents get an information 
packet, 
the 
high 
school 

principal and counselor get 
an information packet,” Ishop 
said. 
“(We’re) 
helping 
the 

student know that, ‘if you are 
admitted to Michigan, if you 
apply to Michigan and get 
admitted to Michigan, your 
tuition is covered.’ ”

White and Soto both said 

the information packet did not 
explain why they qualified for 
the scholarship and left them 
in the dark about the program. 
Soto said she still is not aware 
what the requirements of HAIL 

are; all she knows is it’s helping 
her pay for school. White said 
there 
was 
no 
information 

about the scholarship online.

“When 
I 
first 
got 
the 

(packet) in the mail at the end 
of junior year … I honestly 
thought it was spam because 
I tried to look it up on the 
Internet and I could not find 
anything about it and it was 
very vague, the language,” she 
said. “They didn’t say why I 
was selected and even now, 
talking to some of the other 
scholarship recipients, I can’t 
really see one set commonality 
between all of us.”

Soto and White also both 

said the scholarship tends to 
tokenize students from lower-
income backgrounds. Soto said 
she sometimes feels as though 
she was only admitted to the 
University through the HAIL 
scholarship to fill a diversity 
quota.

“(Tokenization) is actually 

something me and my friends 
talk about pretty often,” Soto 
said. “My boyfriend and my 

best friend from K-school and 
preschool, we all got accepted 
and we were in the top 10 
percent of our (high school) 
class 
and 
we 
were 
really 

excited to get here, but once 
we were here, we realized 
that people that come from 
our communities aren’t very 
represented and it kind of felt 
like (the University) was trying 
to meet a quota in a way.”

Ishop said the University 

attempts to connect students 
with resources on campus, but 
improving diversity is a trial 
and error process for everyone.

“We all have a responsibility 

to make sure that we help our 
students become part of the 
UM experience,” Ishop said. 
“It’s a challenging endeavor for 
us and we don’t always get it 
right the first time but I think 
we’ve put a great deal of effort 
… into identifying students, 
identifying their needs, to 
make sure they’re supported 
by the University.”

The scholarship is still a 

pilot program in its second 
year. According to the DEI 
plan, the program will be 
re-evaluated after three years 
of data have been collected, 
and changes will be made 
accordingly. White agreed the 
scholarship should be more of 
an integration-based program. 
As of right now, she admitted, 
HAIL attracts students to the 
University, but does not make 
them feel comfortable in their 
new academic environment.

“(HAIL) can be improved 

110 percent,” White said. “I 
just think it was a good idea on 
paper but as far as application, 
it kind of fell short in the end. 
As far as what they’re trying to 
do, I think it would be better 
to have more of a program 
and more integration into the 
University. If they really, truly 
wanted these people to come 
here, you’d think they would 
make them feel more accepted 
and more welcome.”

barriers faced by all members

in a more robust and healthier 
way.”

The economy’s relative health 

has shifted the Fed’s current 
focus to sustaining economic 
strength, and Yellen said she 
hopes to gradually raise interest 
rates to a more neutral rate.

While the economy seems to 

be growing now, that was not the 
case during the Great Recession 
of 2008. In December of that 
year, Yellen effectively lowered 
the overnight interest rates to 
zero as a possible solution. When 
that wasn’t enough to revitalize 
the 
economy, 
longer-term 

interest rates had to be lowered 
as well.

Shockingly 
to 
Yellen 
and 

her 
colleagues, 
those 
rates 

remained for seven years — an 
unprecedented amount of time.

“We 
gave 
to 
monetary 

policy all that we had. We did 
everything we possible could to 
support the economy,” she said. 

The 
shock 
of 
the 
Great 

Recession spurred many changes 
within the Fed, according to 
Yellen.

Its 
focus 
has 
expanded 

to banks outside the formal 
banking sector, and yearly stress 
tests are performed to analyze 
how the system would respond 
to severe economic stress. Yellen 
said these tests have been highly 
successful.

“We would examine where 

these institutions would be, what 
their capital would be if there 
were a highly adverse shock to 
hit the financial system,” Yellen 
said. “We want to be ahead of the 
curve and not behind it.”

However, this supervision has 

been criticized as overstepping 
the 
bounds 
of 
the 
federal 

government in the economy. 
Now 
all 
banks, 
including 

shadow banks, are a part of the 
banking system and are subject 
to supervision by the Fed. 
Yellen said this extension is an 
accomplishment, as it forces 
banks to hold more capital and 
more liquidity as opposed to 
being 
reliant 
on 
short-term 

funding, 
thus 
helping 
them 

control risk.

“Our supervision has changed 

in its character and is much 
better and focused on risks in 
the financial system as a whole 
and not on each individual 
institution — or the trees in the 
forest, as opposed to the forest,” 
she explained.

Yellen 
acknowledged 
the 

system 
of 
supervision 
isn’t 

perfect and noted much of the 
criticism comes from community 
banks that feel overburdened 
by the Fed’s regulations. Yellen 
says the Fed tries to tailor its 

approaches to shield community 
banks and some midsize banks 
from the regulations that are 
appropriate for highly systemic 
banks alone.

“I 
think 
we 
ought 
to 

tailor supervision so that it 
is appropriate to the risk of 
a 
particular 
organization,” 

Yellen said. “The most systemic 
institutions really deserve and 
require 
the 
highest 
degree 

of rigor and supervision and 
regulation.”

In addition to the successes 

of the Fed, Yellen highlighted 
some of her economic concerns. 
She noted the economy has 
only grown by about 2 percent 
overall 
since 
the 
recession 

and productivity growth has 
been slow, in part because of 

diminished technical innovation. 
To 
help 
solve 
this, 
Yellen 

recommended reallocation of 
labor from less productive to 
more productive firms.

“The fact that you could create 

that many jobs in the context of 
growth that is so low points to a 
significant problem,” she said.

Additionally, 
Yellen 
said 

certain 
bills, 
including 
the 

Audit 
the 
Fed 
bill, 
would 

end the Fed’s independence 
in 
making 
monetary 
policy 

decisions. Another bill seeks to 
simplify Fed’s decision to use 
a mathematical rule in setting 
interest rates. Deviance from 
this rule would require the 
Government 
Accountability 

Office 
to 
step 
in. 
Despite 

the message these bills are 
sending, Yellen said she sees 
independence as integral to the 
ethics of the Fed.

“The U.S. is well served by 

having a nonpartisan group 
shielded 
from 
short-term 

political 
pressures 
making 

these important decisions,” she 
argued.

Laurien Gilbert, a joint PhD 

student in public policy and 
economics, asked for clarification 
in regards to inflation.

“Students 
are 
often 
told 

that inflation is everywhere, a 
monetary phenomenon,” Gilbert 
said, hoping to see more of a 
detailed explanation often not 
given to students.

Yellen responded that, though 

the concept of inflation — too 
much demand for too small a 
supply — is simple, consumers 
often believe inflation negatively 
directs their buying habits.

In response to a question 

asked by Public Policy graduate 
student Matt Hillard, she said 
though the caution involved with 
articulating thoughts on policy 
is sometimes hindering, her 
career has been fulfilling. She 
advised students to explore their 
passions and urged them not to 
define themselves by the power 
of their jobs.

“The 
core 
of 
having 
a 

satisfying 
career 
first 
and 

foremost was finding something 
to do that I really love and am 
really interested in,” she said.

meeting voted to ratify the contract. 
He said the contract will be sent to 
all union members electronically 
and he expects it will be ratified by 
the organization.

This negotiation has been in the 

works for months as GEO members 
have held grade-ins and sit-ins 
to vocalize their concerns with 
the contract-bargaining process 
they have been engaged in with 
the University since November. 
Many of the proposals GEO 
representatives believed were not 
met by the University include the 
creation of paid staff positions 
for those working on diversity 
programs as part of University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion plan 
launched last October, protections 
for international students and 
expanded health care benefits. 

Last month, an op-ed was 

published in the Daily calling for the 
University to pay Graduate Student 
Staff Assistants and Graduate 
Student Instructors for their work 
in implementing DEI initiatives. 
However, new paid GSSA DEI 
positions were included in the new 
contract.

Additional highlights of the new 

contract include a 3.35 percent wage 
increase this coming September 
for GSIs and GSSAs, another 3.35 

percent increase next September, 
a third 3.3 percent increase the 
following September, protections 
against hiring discriminations for 
international graduate students and 
other new benefits.

Ware said, though the wage 

increases were a large win for 
GEO, there is still a wage gap 
between GSIs and GSSAs between 
the University’s Ann Arbor and 
Dearborn campuses and the Flint 
campus. He said GEO will help to 
close this gap until the University 
intervenes.

“The total costs to close that 

wage gap is about $2,500 a year, so 
until the time that the University 
steps up with that $2,500 a year 
themselves, we, the GSIs, through 
our union, through our dues, we’re 
gonna pay ourselves to close it, just 
out of solidarity with our colleagues 
in Flint,” Ware said.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
was content with the way the 
negotiation went. 

“I think that this worked exactly 

how the collective bargaining 
process should work,” he said. 
“The parties give and take and 
work through it and we’re pleased 
that there’s a tentative agreement 
well ahead of the expiration of the 
current contract.”

In response to an agreement 

between GEO and the University 
being reached, the walkout that was 
proposed Thursday and authorized 

Sunday night has now been called 
off.

“There will be no pickets,” Ware 

said. “GSIs and GSSAs will be at 
work on Wednesday as usual, doing 
what we’re here to do and what we 
love to do — teaching our students 
and making the University the best 
that we can.”

Fitzgerald 
also 
said 
the 

University is glad the walkout was 
called off.

“We think that’s good news,” 

Fitzgerald said. “It’s good for our 
students. As (students) know, it’s 
the last week of classes and it’s 
important to keep all the class 
schedule intact and I hope that 
will be the case now that there is a 
tentative agreement.”

Earlier, at Monday’s sit-in, a 

number of GEO members had 
been vocalizing their concerns 
that GEO’s GSSA and GSI proposal 
should be considered by the task 
force as a way to push DEI initiatives 
and see even larger outcomes. GEO 
Staff Organizer Denise Bailey, a 
Rackham student, said the task 
force should seriously consider 
GEO’s requests. 

“We think that we have a really 

good idea about how to make 
(DEI) work sustainable within the 
University’s structure,” she said. 
“We would like for the task force 
to really consider that particular 
idea, which is to make sure that the 
positions are adequately paid … but 
also given benefits and the other 

sort of protections that come with 
unionization.”

Information graduate student 

Vidhya 
Aravind, 
GEO 
DEI 

Committee member and organizer 
of the sit-in, also said earlier that 
not being able to do the work she 
wants to with regard to diversity 
leads to a lack of sustainable growth 
in inclusion. She also said the DEI 
work GSIs and GSSAs could be 
doing is usually done by faculty 
members who have extra time and 
the ability to work without pay.

“With the amount of work there 

is, (with) the qualification and 
expertise that marginalized grad 
students have in making campus 
better for marginalized students, 
it’s super important that they get 
involved in all the work that they 
can possibly be doing and there’s 
kind of a lot of it,” Aravind said.

Ware said, despite gains made 

in Monday’s contract, more work 
can and will be done by GEO in the 
coming months to create more DEI 
GSSA positions on campus.

“In this campaign, we got our 

collective foot in the door on a lot of 
issues and we’re not done and we’re 
not going away,” he said. “We’re 
going to keep fighting for more DEI 
GSSAs … We absolutely need more 
and we’re going to keep fighting 
and I know that everybody who 
cares about this issue and who cares 
about the position and the work 
of marginalized students on this 
campus is going to keep fighting.”

I

n light of the ongoing 
contract 
negotiations 

between the University 

of 
Michigan 
and 

members 
of 
the 

Graduate Employees’ 
Organization, I felt 
moved to write a 
piece 
that 
details 

my experience with 
Graduate 
Student 

Instructors and the 
tremendous 
impact 

they have had on 
my 
educational 

experience 
here. 

As 
a 
dual-degree 

student in both LSA and the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance, I have had wonderfully 
supportive relationships with 
the vast majority of GSIs I 
have had in my courses, and 
it is mostly because of the 
support they provided through 
an extraordinarily high level of 
instruction that I find myself 
where I am today.

The work GSIs do more 

than warrants certain benefits 
such as an annual 6 percent 
increase in salary to cover the 
high cost of living in Ann Arbor 
and instituting a hard 20-hour 
work-week cap. The inability 
of the University to properly 
compensate 
its 
graduate 

student employees will make it 
difficult for them to perform at 
a high level. This consequently 
detracts from the educational 
experience 
of 
both 
myself 

and all other undergraduate 
students 
at 
the 
University 

due to the significant number 
of 
classes 
that 
have 
GSI 

instruction 
and 
the 
help 

provided 
to 
undergraduate 

students by GSIs in their 
pursuit of an education.

One of the most prominent 

and helpful experiences I’ve 
had with graduate student 
instruction was last year, in 
my second-year written theory 
course. This required course 
built on the concepts taught 
the year before, which I did not 
put much effort into learning 
during my first go-around as a 
freshman. I arrived in my first-
semester, 
second-year 
class 

determined to make up for lost 
time. After struggling through 
my first few assignments, I 
quickly realized that I needed 
extra assistance.

My professor referred me 

to a few graduate students 
who would be able to tutor 
me and help me catch up on 
concepts. I worked countless 

hours with a graduate student 
and progressed from a D the 
previous semester to a B in 

my first term of 
second-year 
theory and an A 
in my final term. 
This 
graduate 

student 
helped 

me 
effectively 

reach 
the 
point 

where I not only 
understood 
the 

material, but I was 
able to teach myself 
to 
understand 

it 
on 
my 
own, 

helping me gain educational 
independence. 
I 
believe 

that part of the educational 
experience at a university is 
learning how to learn, and in 
this context, it was because 
of the tremendous dedication 
of 
a 
Graduate 
Student 

Instructor that I was allowed 

the opportunity to do so.

After succeeding in theory 

and finding an interest in 
the field of communications 
studies, I took it upon myself 
to complete the prerequisite 
coursework 
for 
declaring 

a major in the Department 
of 
Communications. 
The 

instruction I received from the 
GSI in the introductory courses 
was paramount to my success 
and ability to pursue this major. 
At each stage in a difficult term-
long research project for one 
of the prerequisite courses, 
my GSI met with me multiple 
times and reviewed my work. 
His feedback, both related and 
unrelated to my project, was 
essential to my educational 
interests, 
career 
goals 
and 

personal development. Without 
this GSI’s assistance, I would not 
have the same understanding 
of 
the 
narrative 
power 
of 

advertising that I do today.

Moreover, the services that 

my GSIs have provided me 

transcended merely helping me 
understand the coursework at 
hand. They not only helped me 
to know the purpose behind 
the concepts I was trying to 
understand, but also the context 
in which they appeared in the 
real world and what I could do 
to take what I learn to affect 
change in the world as a student 
and professional.

My communications GSI, 

serving as both an instructor 
and mentor, gave me valuable 
insight into the broader field of 
communication studies, what 
my professional opportunities 
were with a communications 
degree 
and 
helped 
me 

understand the relevance of 
what I was doing in regards 
to my future coursework as 
a 
communications 
student. 

It was the experience that I 
had with this GSI — and other 
GSIs ever since — that, more 
so than professors, brought 
my learning full circle, as 
he was able to connect the 
metaphorical dots for me in a 
way that I could not have done 
on my own at the time in a one-
on-one, personalized setting.

The invaluable help and 

guidance that I received from 
my GSIs is not unique to me. 
Without GSI contributions, my 
education and the education 
of many other students would 
be undoubtedly lessened. GSIs 
routinely 
make 
themselves 

available 
to 
help 
students 

like myself with coursework 
through 
holding 
weekly 

office hours that supplement 
those of professors, which 
makes the attainment of an 
education at the University 
more 
accessible. 
These 

office hours served me with 
the valuable link between 
material mentioned in lecture 
and the important concepts 
that I retain for use on exams 
and 
future 
academic 
and 

professional endeavors.

The impact of the work 

GSIs 
do 
is 
significant 
to 

undergraduate 
student’s 

educational 
experiences, 

and 
because 
of 
this, 
the 

University should collaborate 
with instead of combat the 
bargaining efforts of the GEO. 
Without 
GSI 
instruction, 

both 
my 
own 
educational 

experience and that of other 
undergraduate students would 
not be the same.

I

’m sure many of us have 
heard “social media is 
bad” and “it’s ruining 

millennials’ 
lives” 

enough. I won’t add 
insult to injury, but 
as someone who quit 
social media almost 
two years ago, I can 
safely say I have felt 
winds 
of 
change, 

and I am better off 
because of it.

I 
was 
a 
social 

media “enthusiast.” 
When I was in 7th 
grade, some of us didn’t 
have cell phones yet. So, when 
AOL Instant Messager became 
popular, almost everyone had 
an account. I spent my entire 
summer glued to the computer 
screen. The sense of privacy 
and 
direct 
messaging 
was 

precious throughout my angsty 
teen years.

About this time, people were 

moving away from MySpace 
to Facebook. While MySpace 
allowed us to customize our 
home pages, Facebook had new 
features such as photo albums, 
status 
posting 
and 
“like” 

buttons. These new features 
were 
highly 
attractive; 
I 

was constantly told to be 
“photogenic” and “funny,” and 
I found myself craving more 
of these accolades. I posted 
statuses that would draw in 
attention and edited selfies 
to invite more compliments. 
I knew I spent a lot of time 
on Facebook, but my excuse 
was the classic fat talk: “If 
everyone else is doing it, why 
can’t I?”

Shortly 
after 
Facebook 

grew popular, Instagram was 
launched, and it was better 
than Facebook in many ways. 
Instagram specifically targeted 
the younger generation, and 
it was a photo-based social 
network, so aesthetics became 
relevant. 
People 
posted 

pictures 
of 
food, 
outfits, 

traveling and perfectly-edited 
shots of themselves that fit the 
theme of their page. One would 
cut another’s throat to have a 
more “artsy” Instagram page.

Rome wasn’t built in a day 

and neither was my Instagram 
profile. I arranged plates at 

restaurants to take 
the perfect shot of 
the foods I ate. I 
made people stop to 
take 
“celeb” 
shots 

of me as if I were 
a fashion model. I 
became 
obsessed 

with 
things 
that 

were 
aesthetically 

pleasing, colorful and 
spatially organized.

Having 
perfect 

profiles at the touch 

of my fingers made Instagram 
a 
comparing 
machine. 
Do 

I have more “likes” than 
other people? Is my profile 
better-looking 
than 
theirs? 

Do I consistently have more 
followers than them? Though 
taking pictures and editing in 
moderation can be a fun and 
a creative process, Instagram 
was something else — it was 
a competition. Small actions, 
like what restaurant to go to, 
and important life decisions, 
like which friends to keep 
around, were all influenced by 
how I wanted to portray myself 
to others on social media.

I became sick of it. I 

couldn’t enjoy being in the 
moment 
because 
I 
lived 

life through the lens. The 
time, energy and attention 
I put into Instagram was so 
damaging that I wanted to 
quit social media entirely.

The transition to quitting 

social media did not happen 
in a day. It began with telling 
myself to go on it every few 

hours and then every few days. 
It began with deleting apps off 
my phone and re-downloading 
them several times over the 
months. There were urges I 
couldn’t resist. There were 
fears I would miss out on 
opportunities. 
There 
was 

anxiety without my social 
media presence. There were 
thoughts that deleting social 
media would mean losing my 
voice. But it was quite the 
opposite — I regained my voice 
and my life.

Looking 
down 
at 
my 

phone in elevators turned 
into chats with strangers. 
Taking pictures before eating 
turned into a time to express 
gratitude 
for 
a 
wonderful 

meal. 
Scrolling 
through 

Instagram before class turned 
into reading the news. Taking 
pictures of the Law Library 
turned into efficient study 
time. Bingeing on social media 
after a long day turned into 
playtime with my dog. And 
with all the extra time that I 
gained from quitting social 
media, I learned to cook, 
work on small art projects and 
become more involved in my 
own life.

My case of social media 

dependency is actually not 
that special. I personally know 
people who are far worse than 
I was, and I see similar cases 
of 
dependency 
everywhere 

— people just can’t stay off 
social media. I hope that my 
transition to a happier and 
healthier lifestyle can be a 
small reminder to focus on 
important things in your life 
and make experiences your 
very own. Pictures I take 
from 
trips, 
refined 
focus 

toward school, time I spend 
with friends and family and 
all the conversations I have 
with people are now my own 
memory, 
excitement 
and 

wisdom. 
They 
all 
became 

things that I want to share 
with others, offline.

COX

I 
 

love 
a 
good 
snooze. 

Entering 
my 
beloved 

dream world constitutes 

my most consistent 
day-to-day 
goal. 

But 
it 
can 
be 

challenging finding 
a 
good 
enough 

chunk of time to 
get some shut-eye 
when 
burdened 

with essays, exams, 
emails, 
essays 

and more essays. 
Yet, 
no 
matter 

how hard I try to 
secure the doctor-
recommended 
eight 
hours 

of sleep, my energy levels 
somehow manage to only 
allow me six, on average. And 
no matter how content I am 
with my zzz’s, people still 
tell me I need eight hours 
to 
succeed. 
Empirically, 

they’re right. Studies show 
time and again that adults 
need between seven and nine 
hours of sleep. But it’s also 
important for students to 
individualize their sleeping 
habits, as this can greatly 
impact overall well-being. 

For example, when I get too 

much sleep, I’m often much 
more tired throughout the day 
and find myself in need of a 
nap. Too little sleep, and I’m 
struggling to stay alert. Six 
hours seems to be perfect for 
me, which is to say students 
struggling with sleep-related 
stress should learn how their 
bodies react to over- or under-
sleeping. Apps like the Sleep 
Cycle alarm clock are perfect 
for storing and organizing 
data like sleep quality and 
hours slept. This kind of 
tool can help students better 
understand their sleep-related 
needs and better acquaint 
themselves with their own 
biological clocks.

Honestly, it’s tough having a 

non-traditional sleep schedule. 
When society decides to wake 
up at 8 a.m. and go to sleep 
after 10 p.m., it can be difficult 
operating 
on 
a 
different 

circadian rhythm. What’s even 

more fascinating is the wide 
array of slumber patterns that 
coexist on campus. One of my 

friends, for example, 
goes to bed at 10 
p.m. 
every 
night 

and wakes up at 6 
a.m., without fail, 
each morning. He 
then eats breakfast, 
exercises for a bit 
and 
finishes 
up 

any 
remaining 

schoolwork. 
One 

of my roommates, 
on the other hand, 
lives each day as an 

independent entity, separate 
from the other days in the 
week. I remember finding him 
one early morning wide awake 
after getting up at 2:30 a.m., 
going to the local mosque for 
the Islamic dawn-time prayer 
and going on a run by the 
Huron River. Needless to say, 
he crashed at around 9 a.m. In 
his own words, “as long as you 
make up your sleep at some 
point, you’re good.”

Being 
around 
different 

sleeping 
styles 
makes 
me 

question why I’m such a night 
owl. I think it’s because I value 
nighttime differently than the 
daytime. In the daytime, I 
can see how much of the day 
is left depending on the angle 
of the sun and the lengths of 
the shadows. This creates an 
hourglass effect for me. No 
matter what time of day it is, 
I feel like there’s still much 
more to do before that ever-
oncoming sunset. The day is 
always fleeting, and unless 
I can “carpe diem,” I’m left 
worrying about what’s still on 
the to-do list.

But nighttime is different. 

It’s more quiet, more stable, 
more 
blissfully 
abundant 

in 
opportunities. 
In 
the 

night, my mind shifts into 
productivity mode. Creativity 
flows through my fingers 
and ink flows as I make 
calligraphy. Words connect in 
coveted eloquence as I write 
papers I had procrastinated. 
There are fewer people active 

on social media, fewer mass 
emails being sent and fewer 
interruptions to my focus. The 
only downside? It’s so hard to 
find an open restaurant in the 
middle of the night to work at.

Nighttime 
is 
also 
filled 

with fewer requirements and 
greater discretion on how 
I can use my time. I have a 
nightly routine that really 
helps maximize my happiness. 
Happiness is an odd variable, 
because it can’t be quickly 
quantified, like hours spent 
working or sleeping. Based 
on my experiences, however, 
going to sleep happier, even if 
that means fewer minutes of 
sleep, keeps my stress levels 
low. 
Each 
night, 
I 
finish 

my homework, watch some 
Netflix with my roomies and 
make my best efforts to pray 
the night “salah,” one of the 
five Islamic daily prayers. 
Praying, for me, is a form of 
meditation. It’s integral to 
ensuring I go to sleep clear-
headed and focused on what I 
find important.

With exams right around 

the corner, it’s the perfect 
time to maximize healthiness 
and 
happiness 
through 

individualized 
sleeping 

styles. In my case, there are 
some nights when an extra 
30 minutes of sleep seems to 
outweigh 
praying 
“salah.” 

However, 
those 
extra 
30 

minutes don’t offer me the 
same meditative and relaxing 
utility I get from praying. In 
this instance, I’m breaking 
free from the cookie-cutter 
approach to sleep in order to get 
a better night’s rest by praying, 
even if it means sleeping for a 
bit less. I encourage students 
to critically think about the 
days they feel more rested 
or happier and how their 
style and duration of sleep 
influences this so everyone 
can 
make 
individualized, 

informed decisions when it’s 
time to hit the hay.

A Far Cry and Roomful 
of Teeth to play Rackham

NEW AMSTERDAM RECORDS

Room Full of Teeth will be performing at Rackham this Wednesday.

At its heart, public music 

making is about the way in 
which we exist in the same 
time 
and 
place 
as 
other 

people. It’s about how we 
communicate with and relate 
to one another. The playing of 
music is a conversation of sorts, 
an 
interaction 
undertaken 

between the musicians and 
the listeners, each member of 
the dialogue giving something 
and taking something away. It’s 
not a coincidence, then, that 
some of the most interesting 
and engaging music composed 
both throughout history and 
in the present comes from 
a 
wellspring 
of 
mutually 

supportive 
and 
inspiring 

relationships 
between 

musicians. 
On 
Wednesday 

night, 
concert 
goers 
at 

Rackham 
Auditorium 
will 

have the chance to witness 
the fruits of some of these 
relationships in a joint concert 
by the contemporary music 
ensembles A Far Cry and 
Roomful of Teeth.

“It’s a funny thing, often 

in popular culture classical 
musicians are portrayed as 
being very competitive and 
cutthroat with each other,” 
said 
violinist 
Miki-Sophia 

Cloud. “Which of course is 
true in some circles and true 
to some extent, but what’s 
really beautiful about this 
program is that every single 
one of the pieces on the 
program comes from a really 
respectful and inspiring and 
beautiful relationship between 
musicians that were either 
contemporaries or had a very 
close relationship.”

Cloud is a violinist with the 

Boston-based 
contemporary 

music chamber orchestra A 
Far Cry, which was founded 
in 2007 and has since rocketed 
towards the forefront of the 
new music scene. Nominated 
for a Grammy in 2015 for the 
their first album, Dreams and 
Prayers (a recording of Osvaldo 
Golijov’s piece of a similar 
name), the ensemble has been 
active 
in 
both 
performing 

works by living composers 
and 
commissioning 
new 

compositions. On Wednesday 
the chamber orchestra — along 
with the acclaimed, Grammy-
winning 
contemporary 

music vocal octet Roomful of 
Teeth — will be presenting a 
diverse program which spans 
centuries and features three 
compositions 
commissioned 

by either one or both of the 
ensembles performing.

“As we’ve been living with 

this program, we’ve realized 
that it has a very special 
thematic tie, which is that all of 
the pieces on the program are 
really about the relationships 
that musicians have with each 
other,” Cloud said. In addition 
to works by Prokofiev and the 
Renaissance composer Josquin 

des Prez, the concert features 
compositions by two living 
composers, Caroline Shaw and 
Ted Hearne, both of whom are 
friends with members of the 
ensembles.

“When I was in grad school, 

at Yale School of Music, I was in 
a quartet with Caroline Shaw, 
actually, we both played violin 
in a quartet together at school, 
and we were great friends, and 
near the end of her time in 
school she started composing,” 
Cloud explained. “My first 
time hearing her music was at 
her Master’s recital, and I was 
so taken by what she wrote, I 
really specifically remember 
having this really involuntary 
emotional reaction to the piece 
she wrote, and just weeping in 
the concert hall, in the balcony, 
and thinking ‘oh my God.’ Not 
only is she talented in so many 
other ways, but she’s a really 
special voice as a composer as 
well.”

It wasn’t until several years 

later 
that 
this 
friendship 

blossomed into the composition 

“Music in Common Time,” 
which was written for A Far 
Cry and Roomful of Teeth 
and will be the final piece on 
Wednesday night’s concert.

“When I moved back to New 

York, we got together for coffee 
one day,” Cloud recollected. 
“And [Shaw] was telling me 
about this group Roomful of 
Teeth she was singing with, 
and how they just recorded 
their first album, and she wrote 
them a piece and she felt pretty 
excited about it, and I was like 
‘Oh my gosh, you should write a 
piece for A Far Cry.’”

They decided that Shaw 

should write a piece for both A 
Far Cry and Roomful of Teeth, 
of which Shaw is a member.

“We were all really excited 

about it, and then a few months 
later, maybe like the following 
Spring — that was in the Fall 
— in the Spring, you know, she 
won the Pulitzer Prize,” Cloud 
said. “And we were kind of 
laughing that we were lucky 
we got a place on the list before 
she got famous. So she wrote 
this beautiful work for our two 
groups.”

“This 
one 
— 
Music 
in 

Common Time — is a really 
important one to me,” Shaw 
wrote in an email interview. 
“I dove deep into the sound 
of strings and voices, into the 
world of A Far Cry (many of 
them are friends of mine, from 
my violin life) and Teeth. I’m 

not really ready to talk about 
this piece yet. Maybe in a few 
years.”

In 2013, at the age of 30, Shaw 

became the youngest person 
ever to win the prestigious 
Pulitzer Prize for Music, for 
her composition “Partita for 
8 Voices,” which appeared 
on Roomful of Teeth’s debut 
album. “Music in Common 
Time” was commissioned prior 
to the receipt of the prize, 
but after the composition of 
“Partita.”

“My friends Alex and Miki 

asked me to write this piece! 
Way back in 2013, before all 
the 
Pulitzer 
crazytimes,” 

Shaw wrote. “It was my first 
real commission, and it was 
a dream idea, and I am so 
grateful for them for thinking 
of this beautiful program.”

Shaw 
has 
an 
active 

compositional 
life, 

collaborating on pieces with 
the likes of Dawn Upshaw, So 
Percussion, Renee Fleming and 
Jonathan Biss in the classical 
world, and such well-known 
and iconic figures as Richard 
Reed Parry and Kanye West 
outside of the classical genre. 
On 
top 
of 
this, 
however, 

she 
maintains 
a 
presence 

as a performer, and will be 
appearing in her role as a 
member of Roomful of Teeth 
on Wednesday night. In this 
respect, the other featured 
contemporary composer on the 
program is similar.

“This will actually be a very 

special performance because 
Ted Hearne, the composer, 
will actually be singing tenor 
in Roomful of Teeth, which is 
a first,” Cloud said. “He was 
a classmate of both Caroline 
and mine at Yale, and we’ll be 
playing two of his pieces.”

Hearne, who is a member 

of 
a 
group 
of 
composers 

known as the Sleeping Giant 
Collective and an assistant 
professor of composition at 
USC, was commissioned by 
A Far Cry to write his piece 
“Law of Mosaics” a few years 
ago, excerpts of which will be 
performed 
on 
Wednesday’s 

concert.

“‘Law of Mosaics’ is a piece 

that is sort of based on this idea 
of appropriation, you know, 
of the classical music canon 
and music in general,” Hearne 
said. “So the conceit behind 
that piece is that it’s made up 
of pre-existing music, there 
is actually no quote-unquote 
original music that was written 
for it, it’s kind of a patchwork of 
pre-existing pieces arranged in 
a new way.”

One of the movements of 

“Law of Mosaics” featured 
on Wednesday’s concert is 
“Palindrome 
for 
Andrew 

Norman,” which appropriates 
music from Andrew Norman’s 
“Companion Guide to Rome,” a 
string trio which was a finalist 
for the Pulitzer Prize in 2012. 
Norman, 
who 
like 
Hearne 

is a member of the Sleeping 
Giant Collective and teaches

Michelle Branch’s recent album was released April 7th
I want to love ‘Hopeless 
Romantic,’ but I just can’t

Fourteen years later, Branch makes mediocre return to music

The early 2000s were an 

incredible period for alternative 
music — especially those in 
the 
singer-songwriter 
vein. 

From 
Vanessa 
Carlton 
to 

Avril Lavigne, pop anthems 
were produced at an alarming 
rate. But the true pioneer of 
this movement was Michelle 
Branch, responsible for insanely 
catchy, cathartic tracks like 
“Everywhere,” 
“All 
You 

Wanted” and “Breathe.”

Fourteen years after her 

initial success, Branch is back. 
Delayed by issues with previous 
record 
label 
Warner 
Bros., 

Branch recorded her newest 
effort 
Hopeless 
Romantic 

with 
Black 
Keys 
drummer 

and current boyfriend Patrick 
Carney. 
The 

result is vastly 
different 
from 

the sound that 
marked the early 
2000s, 
but 
it’s 

nonetheless 
a 

mostly 
solid, 

varied addition to 
modern pop.

The 
album 

opens 
with 
a 

rocky 
start 
on 

“Best You Ever,” 
a 
bass 
heavy 

track about self-
efficacy in love. 
It’s a bit cliché to 
begin a record titled Hopeless 
Romantic with such a track, 
but it’s far from indicative of 
the rest of the material. The 
instrumentals 
are 
a 
great 

example of Branch’s expanding 
sound but do little to resurrect 
the 
song 
beyond 
its 
basic 

content.

The album quickly reaches 

what can be expected from 
modern pop standards, but 
rarely 
exceeds 
it. 
“You’re 

Good” is easily comparable to 
a Carly Rae Jepsen track, while 
single “Fault Line” is the most 
uniquely Branch’s. “Just when 
I was thinking that I couldn’t 
be lonely any longer / You start 
to pull me under when I try to 
keep my head above the water” 
Branch sings on the first verse 
of the song, using 
a 
metaphorical 

approach to her 
lyricism.

Branch 
hasn’t 

forgotten 
how 

to write a pop 
banger 
though. 

“Heartbreak 
Now” 
brings 

in poppy horn melodies over 
dreamy synth, and it stands out 
among the rest. It’s a beautifully 

crafted 
track 

where Carney’s 
production 
shines 
brightly 

— let’s be honest, 
horns 
make 

almost any song 
better.

Branch 
also 

isn’t 
afraid 
to 

stray 
towards 

the more R&B 
side of pop — a 
scene 
mostly 

dominated 
by 

Lana 
Del 
Rey 

and FKA twigs. 
The title track 

puts a rollicking beat to the 
music, while Branch brings 
her prior soprano tone down 
to a deeper slurring. Again, it’s 
a great showcase of diversity 
on the record, but it also fails 
to be very memorable, despite 
sharing its name with the 
record.

What we really needed from 

Branch was a continuation of the 
catharsis from her previous two 
records — they were drenched 
in emotion. While Hopeless 
Romantic features some good 
pop 
tunes, 
it’s 
heavy 
pop 

focus masks the characteristic 
emotion that launched Branch 
into the spotlight. Despite the 
separation of over a decade, it’s 
impossible to separate turn-of-
the-millennium Branch from 

Branch 
today; 

the 
record 
just 

feels 
like 
less 

of 
an 
artistic 

progression, and 
more of a decent 
entry point into 
modern pop.

Competition 

also detracts from 

the record. In a world with pop 
giants like Grimes and Marina 
and the Diamonds, pop artists 
need a sound that strongly 
differentiates themselves in the 
“Top 40” sea. Again, Hopeless 
Romantic is great, enjoyable 
music, but it lacks a signature 
feel that would compel listeners 
to keep returning. I want to 
love it as badly as I love Spirit 
Room, but the fact of the matter 
is that today’s world is cruel, 
and it doesn’t contain the 
spark needed to survive on the 
battlefield of pop music.

Branch’s third studio album 

contains fun pop tunes with 
classic (probably too classic at 
times) heartbreak lyricism. Its 
sound is thankfully varied and 
rarely stale, but it also pales in 
its attempt to be compelling. 
Branch is back, and if her record 
is any indication, her continued 
evolution in the modern world 
of pop could be something to 
pay attention to in the future — 
but for now we’ll have to wait 
for her to find a sound that is 
hers alone.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

ALBUM REVIEW

Shaw, Hearne and Cloud talk with us about their upcoming show

at USC, was also classmates at 
Yale with Hearne, Shaw and 
Cloud. This sort of exchange 
of ideas and inspirations is 
the type of symbiosis to which 
Cloud referred when she spoke 
of this program being about 
relationships 
between 
the 

musicians.

“I came up in conservatory 

in the early 2000s, right, I 
graduated in 2004, and at 
that time the people we were 
supposed 
to 
be 
studying 

as, 
like, 
making 
the 
best 

contemporary classical music, 
those composers who were 
older, a lot of the people who 
were entrenched in school in 
our education, they were not 
that inspiring to me,” Hearne 
said. “There’s a lot of composer 
colleagues of mine who I think 
probably feel the same way, 
but for me, I really came to be 
inspired by some of the other 
composers I met along the 
way who were my age, who 
were in my generation, who 
were influenced by a lot of 
things around them besides the 

venerated canon of classical 
music … so I think that, for 
me, the people that I’m most 
inspired by are my peers.”

Another piece of Hearne’s 

will 
be 
featured 
on 
the 

program, 
“Coloring 
Book,” 

which was written for Roomful 
of Teeth and aims to explore 
themes of identity.

“‘Coloring 
Book’ 
is 
an 

appropriation of the words of 
African-American writers. It’s 
five movements, and I think 
we’re doing two movements 
that are texts taken from 
Zora 
Neale 
Hurston 
and 

one movement with texts by 
Claudia 
Rankine,” 
Hearne 

said. “Both incredible writers, 

but 
talking 
about 
identity 

and 
specifically 
African-

American identity, so the idea 
of appropriation plays into 
that a lot as well, because of 
course I am not able to speak 
about any sort of African-
American 
experience, 
but 

rather the conceit of the piece, 
the idea, is sort of an identity 
shift, examining the nature of

‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ is 
humble, heartbreaking

Film explores nature of a man and an orphanage during WWII

“Righteous Among the Nations” 

is a term used to identify and 
honor the non-Jews who risked 
their lives to save Jews during 
the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler, 
remembered 
in 
“Schindler’s 

List,” and University of Michigan 
alum Raoul Wallenberg are two 
among the over 11,000 people 
considered “Righteous Among the 
Nations” by Yad Vashem Museum 
in Jerusalem. Jan and Antonina 
Zabinski were also among the 
righteous, but only now has their 
story come fully to light. “The 
Zookeeper’s Wife” details how the 
Zabinskis sacrificed everything 
to do the right thing. Telling the 
stories of the righteous sheds a 
little light onto the darkness of 
tragedy.

Directed by Niki Caro (“Whale 

Rider”), “The Zookeeper’s Wife” 
is based on Diane Ackerman’s non-
fiction book of the same name. 
The film tells the story of Warsaw 
Zoo runners, Jan and Antonina 
Zabinski and how they risked 
their lives to save over 300 Jews 
from the Warsaw Ghetto. They 
developed a strategy in which they 
smuggled Jews from Ghetto into 
their zoo for safekeeping until they 
could escape to safety. Shockingly, 
the Germans used the zoo as an 
arsenal; little did they know that 
the Zabinskis were hiding Jews 

right under their noses.

The story is a beautiful portrait 

of compassion and courage, yet it 
does not shy away from showing 
the pain and suffering in the 
Ghetto. The camera does not hide 
the death, starvation and disease 
that permeated its walls. Among 
the darkness of the Ghetto, there 
existed a small light, a little piece of 
unknown 
history. 

Yet there’s another 
story that has yet 
to be told correctly: 
that 
of 
the 

children’s 
doctor, 

educator and author 
Dr. Janusz Korczak. 
Dr. Korczak was 
renowned 
in 

Poland for his work in children’s 
education, but now he is known 
more as the smiling, storytelling, 
father figure of the Warsaw 
Ghetto orphanage who died with 
his children in Treblinka. “The 
Zookeeper’s Wife” highlights the 
many opportunities to escape that 
Korczak refused in order to stay 
with his children. Jan Zabinski 
(Johan Heldenbergh, “The Broken 
Circle Breakdown”) tries to save 
Dr. Korczak twice in the film, but 
each time Korczak declines. Even 
as the doctor lifts his orphans into 
the train car that will eventually 
take them to their dark fate, 
Korczak tells them whimsical 
stories about Dr. Z and the planet 
Ro.

The film’s strong cast is led 

by Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark 
Thirty”) as the passionate and kind 
Antonia, the zookeeper’s wife with 
a slight Slavic accent and a strong 
grasp of right and wrong. The film 
shows Antonina as an empowered, 
brave woman who, partnered 
with her husband, saved the lives 
of many while sacrificing their 
own. Shira Haas (“A Tale of Love 

and 
Darkness”) 

plays the silent and 
scarred Urszula, a 
young girl from the 
Ghetto who was 
brutally 
assaulted 

and raped by two 
Nazis. Jan, having 
witnessed Urzsula’s 
tragedy, takes her 

in and brings her to the zoo where 
she finds healing, love and bunnies. 
Daniel 
Brühl 
(“Inglourious 

Basterds”) is haunting and sinister 
as “Hitler’s Zoologist” Lutz Heck — 
for a zoologist, he is quite involved 
in the war effort.

The title of the movie seems 

unfitting, because Antonina was 
not just a wife, and Jan was not 
just a zookeeper. Together, their 
zoo became a place of refuge. 
Ironically, 
the 
cages 
became 

freeing and the locks liberating. 
The film is honest without being 
insensitive, heartbreaking without 
being melodramatic and uplifting 
without being contrived. “The 
Zookeeper’s Wife” is a harrowing 
and humbling film that shows 
humanity in the face of inhumanity.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
FILM REVIEW

I am going to die and so 
are you. Sorry about that.

I have this recurring dream 

where I’m stuck at a friend’s 
wedding reception. People are 
throwing bread, I’m eating 
key-lime pie and there’s this 
sense that I’m undoubtedly 
cooler than everyone else. My 
apologies — I’m not a blatantly 
shallow person, but somewhere 
deep down I know I’m part 
lagoon. The thing is, I’m not 
cool, and I don’t even like key-
lime pie. Nonetheless, there’s 
this, “Gah, one day!” mentality 
that I’ve been clinging to 
for a while now. What never 
occurred to me is that there 
might not be a one day; maybe 
there are just days.

Founded by Joseph Gordon-

Levitt and his late brother 
Daniel, 
hitRECord 
is 
an 

online 
open-collaborative 

production 
company 
built 

to connect artists across the 
globe. They put out all kinds 
of 
media 
(albums, 
stories, 

videos, etc.), which they’ve 
coined as “RECords.” Their 
TV 
show, 
“HitRecord 
on 

TV,” is brilliant and had a 
two-season run on Pivot for 
which it won the 2014 Emmy 
in Social TV for Outstanding 
Creative 
Achievement 
in 

Interactive 
Media. 
Each 

20-minute segment is hosted 
by Gordon-Levitt, who goes by 
RegularJOE on the site.

RegularJOE sends out a 

theme and challenges to go 
along with it, and people 
upload various mediums of 
art in response. Users can 
combine the work of others or 
add in layers of their own. In 
a world where originality gets 
hyper-competitive — everyone 
is trying to design better, 
sing better, write better — 

hitRECord gives artists a space 
to build off each other, working 
in tandem to create something 
fantastic.

Every episode takes on a 

different topic. Simply seeking 
to spark discussion and breed 
creativity, 
“HitRecord 
on 

TV” lives in the gray areas of 
existential crises and everyday 
musings. Gordon-Levitt takes 
the show through music videos, 
webcam 
discussions, 
short 

films, open-ended questions 
and other forms of art similar 
to the way “Saturday Night 
Live” travels from skit to skit.

I was completely addicted to 

this series upon discovering it. 
I get into these manic phases 
where I’m so, so desperate to 
know and feel and understand 
the world and to know how 
other people are doing the same 
thing. It makes me restless, 
obsessive even. I obsess over 
what Hilary Duff is up to, 
despondent movie montages 
and the way the sunrise drapes 
that one highway in the most 
delicate shade of pink.

And so it goes. Lounging 

around 
watching 
the 
first 

season, 
one 
episode 
in 

particular took an unwarranted 
hold over me: “The Other Side.”

The other side of life, the 

other side of the screen, the 
other side of the story — the 
segment 
explores 
all 
the 

queries people have about the 
other side and whether the 
grass is actually greener or 
whether someone just hired 
a killer lawn care service to 
chemically delude everyone.

My favorite portion of the 

episode is the music video, 
“Adieu.” 
With 
hand-drawn 

animation from 22 different 
artists and lyrics by user 
joerud, the song is raucously 
sinister. Lives are ending every 
which way, and this smooth, 

honeyed French track drips 
over the whole saga. Scenes 
of utter tragedy and madcap 
fatalities are interspersed with 
a depiction of Gordon-Levitt 
drunkenly stumbling around 
a bar-top. People are going 
wild, and it’s this enormous 
celebration of morbidity.

And then it struck me: I’m 

going to die and so are you. 
Sorry.

Everyone 
dies. 
Everyone. 

For some reason, this banally 
obvious fact hit me heavy. I 
think it’s because I was devoted 
to this notion that there was a 
way for life to be perfect. If I 
could only just find the right 
person or land in the right 
place, life could exist perfectly. 
This 
was 
my 
other 
side. 

Ironically enough, watching 
this animated clip about the 
real other side is what drove 
me to the realization that mine 
isn’t real at all.

I absolutely love the idea of 

another side, but I also can’t 
stand it. It makes me feel like 
I’m not enough, and no one 
should make you feel like 
that — especially not yourself. 
Tomorrow is exhausting to 
think about, and eventually 
tomorrow is going to become 
today: It’s the whopping flank 
of life. Letting go of the idea 
that the future is some elusive 
other side is one of the biggest 
moments of release I’ve ever 
felt.

Not to have a, “dude, we’re 

like alive right now” moment, 
but dude — we’re, like, alive 
right now. We all exist in the 
same world, and we’re all 
going to leave it at some point. 
There is no other side; there’s 
only us. Collaborating and 
conglomerating 
and 
purely 

coexisting — that’s what we 
all have, together, here. Let’s 
create something of it.

Don’t bother getting your 
hopes up for “The Son”

New AMC drama struggles to tell multiple narratives well

“Great goddamn way to 

start a birthday party.”

Cattle 
rancher 
Eli 

McCullough (Pierce Brosnan, 
“GoldenEye”) means “great” 
sarcastically, of course, as 
“The Son” teeters between 
this meaning and the literal 
meaning of “great” in its series 
premiere.

Based off the novel by 

Philipp 
Meyer, 
the 
show 

chronicles the life of Texan 
Eli McCullough at two points 
in his life: 1915, as a rancher 
and oil magnate determined 
to confirm his legacy and 
1849, as a young boy (Jacob 
Lofland, “Mud”) left orphaned 
and imprisoned by Comanche 
raiders.

In the 1915 era, Eli is 

the 
patriarch 
of 
a 
large 

household. 
We 
are 
given 

a taste of the McCullough 
family’s 
complexities 
and 

tensions, but they are never 
explored 
enough. 
The 
key 

characters in this timeframe 
— Eli, his son Pete (Henry 
Garrett, “Zero Dark Thirty”) 
and Pete’s daughter Jeannie 
(Sydney Lucas, “The Skeleton 
Twins”) — take a back seat 
to the progression of plot. 
Granddaughter 
Jeannie 
is 

rebellious and feisty, eager to 
resist the expectations to be 
a lady and adhere to gender 
norms, but her moments are 
overshadowed by her father’s 
and grandfather’s quests on 
the frontier. By the end of the 
second episode, her defiance 
reads as petulant and whiny 
instead 
of 
indignant 
and 

progressive. 
It’s 
a 
shame, 

because her presence as a 

young, female character is 
much needed to balance the 
machismo of the cowboys.

With such a broad scope, 

there are opportunities for 
characterization 
and 
depth 

that seem lost in the pursuit 
of drama and conflict. Pete’s 
older brother Phineas (David 
Wilson 
Barnes, 
“Capote”) 

proves 
himself 

to 
be 
more 

resourceful 
and 

knowledgeable, if 
not as masculine 
and physical as 
Pete. 
Phineas 

also 
makes 

multiple 
passes 

at 
Pete’s 
wife, 

who 
graciously 

accepts 
them. 

While perhaps not central 
to the narrative, these seem 
like missed opportunities to 
flesh out Pete’s flaws. The 
show’s leading man struggles 
to find his footing, too, as the 
patriarch of the McCullough 
family. By all appearances, 
Brosnan is the head honcho, 
but he struggles to fill the 
boots of a man weathered by 
the harsh conditions of the 
Texas landscape. He seems too 
clean and civilized for a man 
that has experienced what 
young Eli has.

Young Eli, however, redeems 

some of the show’s misgivings 
through emotional depth that 
old Eli lacks. In a harrowing 
scene, Eli watches his Native 
American captors stab his 
older brother with a spear 
repeatedly as Eli is held down 
by a member of the tribe. Point 
of view shots on the ground 
immerse the viewer in Eli’s 
pain and frustration. Suffering 
characterizes his experiences 
with the Comanche, who beat 

and disrespect him, except for 
Toshaway (Zahn McClarnon, 
“Fargo”). 
Their 
bond 
is 

compelling, yet sorely ignored.

While Young Eli’s narrative 

is more intriguing than Old 
Eli’s, both are unified by 
strong visuals. The fires that 
ravage Eli’s childhood home 
and only oil rig are dramatic, 

consuming 
and 

accompanied 
by 
ambient 

music 
that 

suggests tragedy 
and 
discord. 

Expressive shots 
of 
the 
Texas 

landscape convey 
the hostility and 
grittiness of the 
people that dwell 

there. The physical appearance 
of characters is appropriate, 
too. They look sweaty and 
dishevelled when at work or 
in the wild, manicured and 
primped when at social events.

Overall, the show struggles 

to braid its narratives together. 
There is a disparity between 
the screentime in each era. 
1915 gets more attention while 
brief scenes in 1849 reveal 
Eli’s background, which is 
necessary to understand him 
in the 1915 era. Young Eli isn’t 
featured enough to make Old 
Eli a sympathetic character. 
In addition, actions that take 
place in the 1915 era feature 
multiple 
characters 
at 
a 

choppy pace, so it’s hard to get 
a sense of anyone’s true self. 
This strategy may work better 
on the page. While television 
does afford some advantages, 
it can’t hide the deficiencies 
inherent in the structure of 
the show. Give the rest of the 
season a try, but don’t hold 
your hopes too high.

THANK YOU, MR. BERENSON

On Tuesday, Red Berenson 

announced his retirement as the 
head coach of the Michigan hockey 
team after 33 seasons. With his 
career coming to a close, former 
Michigan Daily hockey beat writers 
chose to reflect on their time 
covering the Wolverines under Mr. 
Berenson.

Avi Sholkoff, 2016-17: Prior to 

beginning my studies at Michigan, 
I knew little about hockey or Red 
Berenson. After only one year in 
Ann Arbor, I learned all about the 
famous head coach and his work at 
the helm of the Wolverines. In my 
second year, I had the opportunity 
to cover the Michigan hockey team 
for the Daily. About a month into 
the season, I went to Yost Arena 
after class one day to interview him 
by myself. Before he answered my 
questions, he asked me about where 
I was from and what I studied. 
Once learning I intended to minor 
in Spanish, he commended me for 
my decision to study a language 
and explained that he was once in 
Finland with some Finnish and 
Russian players who could speak 
multiple languages, while he could 
only speak English. It really warmed 
my heart because it showed that he 
cared what we Daily kids did.

Additionally, as someone who 

stutters, I’m often self-conscious 
of myself when I ask questions in 
press conferences. When I told Red 
about my stutter, he encouraged me 
to continue to asking questions and 
to not be afraid. 

I’ll always cherish my year 

covering the Michigan hockey team 
and the time I spent speaking with 
Red Berenson.

Mike Persak, 2016-17: The 

first time I met Red Berenson, I 
nervously shook his hand as he 
walked out of the room. The bones 
in his hand cracked loudly as I 
grabbed it, and he continued to walk, 
seemingly unfazed. Whether it was 
talking about hockey, or telling 
me off to the side of practice how 
he was worried about millennials 
using their phones too much, Red 
had a fascinating way of being 
commanding 
without 
seeming 

angry or scary. I’m grateful for his 
acceptance of the Daily and his 
willingness to give us all the access 
we had. Talking with other writers 
around the country, I’ve come to 
realize that we might have it better 
than any other college paper in that 
sense. Because of this, I believe my 
writing has come an extremely long 
way, and I have Red’s generosity to 
thank.

Laney Byler, 2016-17: I’ll never 

forget when Red Berenson told me 
he would look for my story in the 
paper the next day. It might not 
seem like much — it was a simple 
story about the history of Yost — but 
it was a story I was excited to write, 
and the fact that Red wanted to read 
it made it seem that much better.

Everyone always talks about 

how much Red Berenson meant 
to college hockey, and I have 
absolutely no doubt in my mind that 
the impact he made will last forever. 
But if there’s one thing I want to 
make clear, it’s that Red Berenson 
meant just as much to the college 
journalists he worked with.

His generosity was unparalleled 

as he let our beat (and many before 
us) fly on the team plane to attend 
games we otherwise couldn’t go 
to. He gave us honest answers 
and expected us to act like real 
journalists, whether we were a 
group of 19-year olds or not. But 
covering Michigan hockey with 
Red Berenson was never something 
I didn’t look forward to; it wasn’t 
easy, but it was unbelievably 
rewarding.

The Daily was lucky to have a 

coach like Red to cover, but not as 
lucky as the student journalists who 
experienced it firsthand.

Orion Sang, 2016-17: One doesn’t 

have to look far to understand 
the impact Red Berenson had on 

everyone he touched throughout 
his career.

Just open up Twitter and scroll 

through the few hours around 3 
o’clock Monday, and you’ll get a 
good idea. But it wasn’t just those 
on the rink who Berenson had an 
immeasurable impact on — the 
way he handled writers, especially 
us young cubs at the Daily, was 
truly remarkable. He didn’t have 
to sit down with us after every 
weekday practice, yet he did — 
sometimes running perilously close 
to his scheduled radio show at Pizza 
House in the process. He didn’t have 
to offer us two seats on the team 
plane for road trips, yet he did — and 
the plane didn’t even leave without 
us when we showed up at the wrong 
side of Willow Run Airport. And he 
didn’t have to be just so damn nice 
to us, as we worked on our craft and 
asked him questions he may not 
have felt like answering. Yet he did, 
and I will forever be grateful to him 
for that and all of the other gestures.

Jason Rubinstein, 2014-16: In 

my opinion, there was no coach 
friendlier to the media than Red. 
He always went out of his way to 
accommodate the Daily, including 
taking us on the team plane to cover 
away events. You truly had to no 
excuse to be uneducated about the 
team and if you were, Red would 
call you out or simply give you his 
famous blank stare. I always felt 
like Red cared about my life outside 
of hockey writing as well, and he 
helped me decide what I wanted to 
do with my future. I’ll be forever 
grateful to Red.

Minh Doan, 2015-16: Red didn’t 

just understand hockey himself, but 
he wanted everyone to understand 
with him. Whether it was giving me 
a blank stare when I didn’t notice 
he had switched lines in practice 
(which 
happened 
regrettably 

often) or explaining to me how the 
umbrella power play system worked 
after practice one afternoon, Red 
wanted me to be knowledgeable 
about hockey and went out of his 
way for me to be so.

But in my mind, that not what 

I’m the most thankful for about 
Red. That award would go to Red’s 
level of care for those around him. 
And the access he gave to the Daily 
exemplified that. By taking us on 
the team plane to opening up every 
practice to us, Red made it really 
hard for us to do a bad job.

He gave us everything we needed 

to do a good job, and after covering 

college 
hockey 

for a 
year, I really 

believe 

that no college hockey outlet had it 
better.

That’s what I valued the most 

about Red. He truly cared about 
my 
success, 
whether 
it 
was 

within 
journalism 
or 
outside, 

and it’s for that care that I’m 
incredibly thankful to have had the 
opportunity to cover him for a year.

Kevin Santo, 2015-16: There are 

just two stories that I need to tell.

Last 
November, 
roughly 
a 

month after I started covering the 
Michigan hockey team, Red walked 
out of his office while I was waiting 
to interview one of his players. He 
stopped in the doorway, turned to 
me and said, “Just so you know, the 
first thing my wife asks me when I 
get home is, ‘Did you bring home a 
Daily?’ ”

The second happened a couple 

months later, when I sat down with 
Red to watch one of the team’s 
practices. We didn’t mention a word 
of hockey. Instead, I asked him 
where he thought his life would 
have gone without the sport, and 
he told me of all the things that 
piqued his interest in college. What 
surprised me was that he then asked 
me about my future plans. I told 
him I wanted to go into journalism. 
He paused.

Then he looked me in the eyes 

and told me, “You know, you’re 
gonna need to outwork a lot of 
people for that.”

It was something I already knew, 

but hearing it come from Red was a 
kick in the ass I needed at the time.

So I just want to say thank you 

Red, for always caring about the 
college kids who covered your team, 
and thank you Mrs. Berenson, 
for caring about what those same 
college kids were writing.

Zach 
Shaw, 
2014-15: 
Like 

everyone, I learned a lot from Red 
Berenson, probably more than I 
realize yet. But my main lesson has 
to do with Red’s comical desire to 
fly the student hockey reporters 
to all the road games. I mean, who 
does that? Red does, whether his 
administrators wanted him to or 
not. But what impressed me most 
was why he did it. Red is not this 
charismatic storyteller that loves 
to have bumbling student reporters 
ask him questions or write stories 
about him, and 
the Daily 
has 
a 

long 
history 
of not 

holding back when hockey players 
get into trouble on campus. The 
flight was not a gift to show his 
appreciation, it was a lesson. When 
you get to be as close to a team as 
Red let the Daily get, you learn just 
how human the team is. You learn 
what that flight home is like after a 
curb-stomping loss, and you learn 
how emotional an injury can be for 
the entire team.

Living, studying and spending all 

of your time with your teammates 
is a phenomenon unique to college 
athletics, and it’s so difficult to truly 
understand it from the outside. But 
when I thanked Red for letting me 
cover the team at the end of the 
season, and he said “I hope we gave 
you a better understanding of what 
we go through,” I realized he put 
us on the inside not just for P.R. or 
goodwill, but to give us that inside 
experience so few ever get. Every 
time I write a story, I draw on that 
experience that Red went out of his 
way to give me.

Erin Lennon, 2013-15: I knew 

nothing about ice hockey when 
I started writing about it. Red 
Berenson knew that as well as I did, 
though he never asked and never 
once called attention to questions 
that exposed my untrained eye. 
Instead, Red’s answers were coated 
in thoughtfulness and filled with a 
type of confounding wisdom that 
resonated far beyond the ice rink. 
I’ll remember his gentle delivery, 
the anecdotes and the drawn out 
metaphors, the crooked smirk he’d 
make when he delivered a line he 
knew would become the pull quote 
in my article — “With cement trucks 
out there, you have to decide how 
fast you’re willing to go. There’s a 
risk involved in using that speed. Do 
you want to go or is it safer to stay 
here?”

And I’ll never forget the hushed 

plane ride back from a losing effort 
against the Gophers in Minnesota. 
I was making my way back to my 
empty row from the restroom 
when Red looked up from his game 
notes and gestured toward me in 
the aisle. He wanted to make sure 
I’d also received one of the warm 
cookies and milk that his players 
were wolfing down behind us, 
compliments of the charter plane. 
Yes, I had. Thank you, Coach.

Greg Garno, 2012-14: The thing 

I appreciate about Red is that he 
never tried to BS me. With Red, you 
could count on his honest thoughts. 
He wasn’t afraid to say how poorly 
his team played if they had a bad 

game (and they did). He never 

tried to praise someone too 

much if they had a game (there was 
still more they could do). And he 
made sure to tell me I should have 
gotten a business degree instead of 
something else (he was right). When 
so many coaches aren’t willing 
to speak with media members 
or decide to spin something in 
order to avoid backlash, Red was a 
refreshing anomaly. There he was 
in the blue chair at the head of the 
room, Monday through Thursday 
ready for questions. Perhaps I 
was spoiled by that honesty as I 
continued reporting, but I know 
that I was better because of it.

Alejandro 
Zúñiga, 
2012-

14: His eyes tell stories. That’s 
what I remember. You would be 
talking hockey with one of the 
sport’s legends, and occasionally 
a question would make his eyes 
sparkle. And you knew that, for 
a moment, the man who so often 
spoke about winning the next 
game was reminiscing about some 
other game, weeks or years or even 
decades before. Sometimes, if you 
were lucky, you’d hear a piece of 
history that would haunt you the 
next day, because you knew your 
writing could never do it justice. 

Red Berenson often thanked the 

Daily for covering hockey, for caring 
about his teams. That always struck 
me as silly, because of course we 
cared. We cared about the stories 
he told, the players he coached, the 
program he revived. And Red, it 
was an absolute honor. 

Liz Vukelich, 2011-13: One 

September afternoon, I found 
myself sitting in Red Berenson’s 
office 
conducting 
a 
preseason 

interview. Somehow the Daily’s 
sports editors thought it would be 
OK to put me on the hockey beat, 
despite the fact that I had never 
sat through a hockey game before 
and in all honesty, had very little 
understanding of how the game 
worked. 

I’m happy to share I’m not that 

shaky, hockey illiterate person 
anymore and that is solely thanks 
to Red Berenson. Though Red 
never coached me on the ice, he 
coached me and every other Daily 
writer who ever had the pleasure 
of sharing a post-practice interview 
with him just as much as any athlete 
who has ever played under him. 
He had a patience that I’ve never 
encountered in any other coach 
and he cared about turning every 
single student journalist he crossed 
paths with into a bona fide hockey 
pro. No question was too simple 
— he’d pause interviews to make 
sure us Daily writers had a firm 

grasp of the concepts he was talking 
about. Red cared about us in such 
an unsuspecting way and is one of 
the most generous people you’ll ever 
encounter when it comes to his time. 
Even when I reached my goal senior 
year of covering Michigan football, 
part of me still thought how lovely 
it would be to just go back to sitting 
in the hockey media room again and 
listen to Red chat about hockey and 
life.

A few weeks before I graduated, 

myself and a fellow beat mate made 
an appointment to meet with Red, 
to see if we could express to him 
how much of an impact he had had 
on our time at Michigan. The three 
of us talked — he asked about our 
post-graduate plans and we shared 
some happy memories that we had 
made covering his team. After a few 
minutes of conversation, it was time 
to leave and we asked if we could 
take a quick picture. And Red, who 
had shared some incredible stories 
over the previous years, uttered the 
seven greatest words I’ve ever heard 
come out of his mouth:

“Is this going to be a selfie?”
Matt Slovin, 2011-13: Some of 

my best memories of college came 
from covering Red’s teams. Rare 
is the coach that commands the 
level of respect he did. I remember 
flying 
back 
from 
the 
Upper 

Peninsula on the team charter after 
a particularly stinging loss, and not 
a word was spoken the entire way 
back to Ann Arbor. Those losses 
were uncharacteristically frequent 
for Red’s teams during the two 
years I covered him, but even so I 
realized that I was in the presence 
of a coaching legend. Like so many 
Daily writers before me, I attribute 
my love of hockey to Red.

Zach Helfand, 2011-12: Everyone 

in 6th Bush in South Quad my 
freshman year, or at least everyone 
with hockey student tickets, knew 
that the second shot before leaving 
for Yost was sacred. That one was 
always reserved for a toast: “To 
Red Berenson.” A year later, when 
researching a story, I’d find out that 
just about all that we loved about 
Michigan hockey games could be 
credited to Berenson; without him, 
there’s a decent chance there’s no 
more hockey program to speak of.

Which also would’ve meant a 

lot fewer sportswriters. Berenson 
showed clear fatherly disapproval of 
us Daily kids heading full steam into 
a dying profession, was a big reason 
we were heading full steam in the 
first place. We all heard stories 
about Red. He was terrifying. And 
we thought if we could win over 
Berenson we could take on just 
about anyone. The truth really was, 
Red was kind of a softy. He wouldn’t 
say it, but if you showed up every 
day, worked hard and wrote fairly, 
you were one of his guys. And he’d 
take care of you.

Because we cared a lot about 

our hockey coverage, we needed 
a way to get a writer up to Green 
Bay, on short notice, for the skate-
around the day before the NCAA 
tournament started. Red, we found 
out, cared a lot about our hockey 
coverage, too — or least cared about 
us. And so a spot opened up on 
the team charter. We were riding 
with Red. We wrote an article that 
day about a possible line change, 
a nugget he probably would’ve 
preferred stay unpublished. But fair 
was fair, and he took care of us. So 
from a grateful sportswriter (sorry, 
Red), a toast to a very deserved 
retirement: To Red Berenson.

Everett Cook, 2011-12: On the 

43rd anniversary of his six-goal 
game, Red sat in his usual chair and 
fielded the usual questions. We sat in 
our regular spots, Zach and I to his 
right and Liz and Slovin to his left, 
and talked lines and pairings. We 
did not discuss one of the greatest 
scoring outbursts in the history of 
the NHL, the night Red

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Michigan coach Red Berenson announced his retirement Saturday afternoon at the Junge Family Champions Center after leading the Wolverines for 33 years.


8 — Tuesday, April 11, 2017
Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Berenson revived ‘M’ with family atmosphere

R

ed Berenson was 
Michigan hockey.

For the last 33 

seasons, he has been the 
Wolverines’ head coach. And 
before that, Berenson tallied 
43 goals in his senior season at 
Michigan in 1961-62. That total 
still stands 
today as the 
most goals 
in a season 
in Wolverine 
history. 

After his 

collegiate 
playing 
career, 
Berenson 
immediately 
moved to the NHL, competing 
in the 1962 playoffs with the 
Montreal Canadiens the same 
season.

It was the start of a long 

20-year professional hockey 
career for Berenson. And after 
that ended, he bounced around 
the NHL, coaching in St. Louis 
and as an assistant in Buffalo, 
before finding himself back in 
Ann Arbor as the head coach at 
his alma mater.

But on Tuesday, that will no 

longer be the case.

In his time at the helm of 

the Wolverines, Berenson has 
grown to legendary status in 
the hockey community. He has 
led Michigan to two NCAA 
Championships, 11 Frozen Four 
appearances and 11 CCHA 
Championships as well as a 
streak of 22-straight NCAA 
Tournament appearances from 
1991-2012.

But that’s not what Berenson 

is most proud of.

Two days after winning 

the Stanley Cup with the 
Canadiens in 1965, Berenson 
began taking classes in the 
business school at Michigan. 
He claims that was the best day 
of his life, trumping both the 
victory with the Canadiens and 
the championship parade that 

followed.

It was the first sign of the 

family atmosphere he would 
eventually try to build, as the 
University and its students felt 
like a family to him.

The effect the degree has 

had on him is evident, as he 
now preaches the importance 
of academics to all of his 
players. But it isn’t the only 
value he’s instilled in them.

“One of the biggest things 

I’ve taken away from Red 
is that you’re going to treat 
people with respect,” said 
former goaltender Shawn 
Hunwick, who played under 
Berenson from 2007-12. 
“You’re going to do things the 
right way. You’re going to do 
it day in and day out, and it’s 
going to shape who you are as 
a person.

“And for me, (the) thing 

about not being a ‘hockey 
bum’ and life after hockey — I 
only played one year after 
Michigan. I decided that 
Michigan was the pinnacle of 
my playing career and I wanted 
to move on, and I took his 
advice to heart. 
He helps mold 
great, young 
men who play 
in the NHL, but 
more so the guys 
who go off into 
the work force 
and in family 
life.”

Over the last 

year, Berenson 
was asked 
to be a guest 
speaker in Classic Civilizations 
Professor Chris Potter’s course 
at the University, where he 
discussed his entire career.

He wanted to leave a lasting 

impression on the class, 
especially since there were 
so many student athletes in 
attendance, so he gave them a 
bit of advice.

“I think the clearest thing 

he said to everybody is don’t 
count on sports,” Potter said. 
“… I think it was very powerful 
to see someone who’d been 
as successful in the athletic 
arena speaking out to athletes 
and others saying, ‘You really 
have to plan your life, and you 
have to try to excel at whatever 
it is that you’re doing. Not to 
simply say to yourself that I’m 
this great hockey player or 
whatever, but that the values I 
bring to the rink are the values 
I bring to everything else.’ ”

Berenson’s impact was seen 

Monday in his last moments as 
head coach. Along with local 
media outlets and current 
team players, multiple former 
players and various other 
Michigan coaches stood in 
the Junge Family Champions 
Center for his farewell press 
conference.

One of those in attendance 

was men’s basketball coach 
John Beilein. Beilein came 
to support his colleague, and 
his respect for Berenson was 
apparent.

“I usually go to one game a 

year,” Beilein 
said. “It’s 
unfortunate that 
our schedules 
cross over so 
much. We were 
rarely able to 
attend each 
other’s events. 
He’s come to 
my practices, 
I’ve been to his 
games. I just 
think there’s 

a great crossover in just the 
same values.

“… Here’s one thing that 

resonates that he told us: 
‘Practice like you’re in second 
place, and then play like you’re 
in first place.’ I just said it to 
my team before we went to the 
tournament, when we had all 
the success.”

The reason that Berenson 

has earned so much respect 
all around the University is 
not just because of his success 
on the ice. It’s because of how 
much he loves the University 
itself.

Berenson came back to 

the University 
looking to 
cultivate 
a family 
atmosphere in 
his program. 
Monday, as 
he reflected 
on his time 
at Michigan, 
he considers 
his attempt a 
success.

“I want this 

to be a big 
family,” Berenson said. “I want 
the players to feel like this is 
family. Even the guys I came to 
school with in the late (1950s), 
we’re still the best of friends 
and we stay in touch. I think 
it’s a big Michigan family, and 
we tried to establish that. One 
of my first problems coming 
back was to get the alumni 
back on board. … They’re back, 
and I feel good about that.”

Ironically enough, though, 

one of the most prominent 
examples of Berenson’s 
family atmosphere is a player 
he’s only coached for one 
season — freshman forward 
Will Lockwood, who was the 
second-leading scorer on the 
team with 20 points.

Lockwood came to Michigan 

32 years after his father, Joe 
Lockwood, who played on 
the first Berenson-coached 
Michigan team. For Joe, the 
opportunity for his son to play 
on a team coached by a man 
who had brought him so many 
life lessons was something he 
relished.

“I wanted Will to have a 

chance — I’m glad he got one 
year, I’ll just say that,” the 
elder Lockwood said. “Red’s 

more than just a coach. He’s all 
about the University, he’s about 
the hockey, he’s just a great 
representative of the athletic 
department. I’m glad my kid 
had a chance to play for him for 
one year anyway.”

Joe Lockwood 

isn’t alone in 
his sentiment. 
It’s one that 
is considered 
the norm for 
anyone who 
has played for 
Berenson, and 
for as important 
as he’s been 
to Michigan 
hockey, his 
legend reaches 
far beyond the 

ice. He’s taught the people 
around him life lessons that 
they’ll take with them for the 
rest of their lives.

Whether it’s coaches who 

have been alongside him 
through the years, players 
who have learned from him 
or students who have simply 
observed his teams, there is an 
indelible mark that Berenson 
has left on the University.

For him to be gone now is 

going to be hard for many to 
swallow.

“For me, it gives you an 

idea that the people that 
believe in you and that stood 
behind you, that they’re not 
always going to be there,” said 
Michigan goaltending coach 
Steve Shields. “When I think 
of what’s important to me in 
my life, Michigan hockey is 
just about number one. Not 
having Coach there and having 
the coach be somebody I don’t 
know, you think about it, and 
you want to be a part of it, but 
it’s sad that things like that 
have to happen.”

Added Hunwick: “Coach 

talked about his best day of 
his life being when he was in 
class at Michigan. … But the 

best day of my life was when 
Coach said I can come play at 
the University of Michigan. … I 
was giving up hockey because 
I was coming to be a third 
goalie. Coach told me, ‘You’re 
going to be a good teammate, 
you’re going to be a member of 
this team, you’re going to have 
to be a good student. He is a 
legend. I’m a walk-on, third-
string goalie, and he treats us 
like the Hobey Baker winner. … 
He’s the same guy to everybody 
in the room.”

Berenson was Michigan 

hockey. Tuesday, he won’t be 
anymore.

But the mark Berenson left 

is permanent. He has built 
an atmosphere where former 
players are willing to send 
their highly-touted sons to play 
for him. It’s an atmosphere 
where alumni of the program 
are willing to come back at 
the drop of a hat to support 
another former player who is 
suffering from ALS.

Berenson is one of the most 

well-respected, living figures 
in hockey. The day before 
announcing his retirement 
he joined other legends of the 
game in commemorating the 
closing of Joe Louis Arena, 
where he coached the first 
game played there with the St. 
Louis Blues.

Berenson said himself 

Monday, it’s time for the 
program to go in another 
direction, and he may have a 
point. But Berenson and his 
accomplishments won’t be 
forgotten anytime soon.

He and his teams have 

inspired fans to continue to 
pack Yost Ice Arena despite the 
up-and-down teams in recent 
years.

But the reason the fans keep 

coming back is the atmosphere 
that Berenson has worked so 
hard to cultivate in the last 33 
years, and for that, Michigan 
will always owe him gratitude. 

tallied double hat tricks as a 

forward for the St. Louis Blues, 
because we forgot to bring it up.

As he walked out, Red mentioned 

this to us. Beat writers had always 
asked him about the Nov. 7 
anniversary, and we hadn’t. 

This was Red. He could’ve 

lectured us or said nothing, even 
let ego cloud the lesson. But he 
knew we were young and he 
knew we were learning and so he 
instead decided to teach us about 
diligence and research in his own, 
gracious way. I’ll be hard pressed 
to ever cover a coach that generous 
again.

Michael Florek, 2009-11: In two 

years of covering Red Berenson’s 
hockey teams (2009-10 and 2010-
11), I, like most Daily reporters 
covering the team, spent almost 
every day in the lounge outside of 
the hockey offices talking with Red 
for 15 minutes or so.

In me and my beatmates’ time 

with Red, we talked about hockey, 
but we also talked about the 
journalism industry, his playing 
days, and how to find good pucks by 
smelling them. We learned a lot of 
lessons there. Some of them we’ve 
already forgotten, but I’ll never 
forget the musk ox protective circle 
because of him.

One day, early in the season, 

we asked about Michigan’s next 
opponent, 
Alaska 
Fairbanks. 

Fairbanks was famous for not 
allowing many goals. When we 
asked 
about 
(this), 
Berenson 

initially did the usual coachspeak. 
Then, he stopped. I’m not sure if 
he sensed we didn’t understand or 
had just been watching National 
Geographic, but he asked us if we 
knew what musk ox were.

He explained they were long-

haired, bison-looking animals that 
lived in the arctic.

When they sense a threat, they 

form a circle around their young 
and forced their attacker to try to 
break through.

Alaska did that, but around their 

net.

We left the lounge that day 

both with more clarity on Alaska 
Fairbanks’ defensive system and a 
better understanding of the natural 
world.

Mark Burns, 2009-11: “Who 

wrote the Louie column?” Red 
Berenson casually asked as we 
began our usually after-practice-
interview-sessions upstairs at Yost 
Ice Arena, with Berenson carrying 
his customary coffee mug and 
plopping in the same blue chair.

I had written a column midway 

through 2009-10 season in January, 
basically asking where was then-
junior forward Louie Caporusso’s 
production on the ice. It was 

pretty scathing in hindsight. And 
yet, Caporusso made me eat my 
words six weeks later as I wrote an 
apology column to him. Berenson 
was referencing the latter column 
that March.

After a few moments of silence, I 

slowly raised my hand and without 
words he knew. “Good...good...
good,” I can remember hearing him 
saying back. “Ok, first question...”

Yes, it was one singular moment 

in two years of the covering the 
Michigan hockey team, but you 
knew how much Berenson cared 
about his players based on that, 
albeit brief, exchange. He was 
sharp as a whit despite being 
around 70 at the time — and still is, 
I’m sure of it.

I think he appreciated, more 

than anything, the Daily hockey 
beat writers’ commitment to their 
craft and covering the team at 
nearly every single game, even 
if it meant a 48-hour excursion 
to New Hampshire and back for, 
yes, one measly game against a 
non-conference foe. He knew we 
were dedicated, even giving us 
the occasional shoutout at press 
conferences at Joe Louis Arena in 
front of 20 other media members 
who only covered the team during 
big games.

So with that, enjoy retirement, 

Coach Berenson. Thanks for the 
memories and being able to sit 
with you for those interviews after 

practice. Those were pretty special.

Andy Reid, 2007-08: My first 

major beat at The Daily was the 
hockey team. The first time I met 
Red, he walked into the hockey 
office after practice in his socks, 
sipping a coffee. He sat in his cushy 
recliner and looked expectantly at 
us. I’ve never been more intimidated 
in my life.

But Red went out of his way to 

make the student writers at the 
Daily feel at home. He understood 
we were learning to be professionals, 
just like his players. He saw me 
walking home from a post-practice 
press conference once, pulled over 
and said, “Get in.” Not a question. 
Not a suggestion. And gave me a ride 
home and asked about my studies 
and life. He was stern, but he cared. 
About Michigan, not just the team.

Red, I’m sorry I wore a green hat 

into your office that one time. I’ll 
never do it again. But thank you for 
allowing me, however briefly and 
tangentially, to be involved in your 
career. There will never be another 
one like you.

Nathan Sandals, 2007-08: It’s 

hard to pinpoint any particular 
story, but I will never forget the 
weekend Bo Schembechler died, 
the hockey team was at Ferris State. 
It was all hands on deck at the Daily 
for a special Saturday edition, so 
no one from the hockey beat was 
at the game on Friday night. After 
the game on Saturday night (during 
which another Michigan team lost 
by three points in Columbus) we 
went to Red’s press conference. “I 
don’t think I saw any of you guys 
last night,” Red said to me and 
my beat mate, with a mischievous 
smile. He was busting our chops 
a little bit, but as a beat writer, we 
knew he appreciated our work and 
even when he gave us grief (which 
happened from time to time), he 
was always generous with his time 
and cared to see that student writers 
had every chance to succeed as they 
learned their trade.

One other point: Red was not 

my professor, but I spent at least 15 
minutes a day in his office hours for 
two years. I’m grateful to have had 
the opportunity to learn from one of 
the greatest teachers of hockey and 
life that the University has ever had.

James Dowd, 2005-07: Having 

followed Michigan hockey from a 
young age, it was an intimidating 
experience to come face to face 
with Coach Berenson for the first 
time at the GLI during the 2004-

05 season while filling in on the 
hockey beat. Over the next two 
seasons with The Daily and the 
following years with Inside College 
Hockey, the nervousness subsided 
and I was lucky enough to learn 
a vast amount about the game, 
both on and off the record, from 
Red. Chatting in his office after 
practice, press conferences or phone 
conversations, Red always required 
you to be prepared and be your best 
and made all of us who covered 
Michigan hockey better journalists 
by coaching us to be students of 
the game. I’ve always admired 
the deep relationships he built 
and maintained with his players, 
be them Stanley Cup champions, 
members of the Armed Forces, 
neurosurgeons or businessmen. I’ll 
always be grateful for the standard 
he held myself and my colleagues to 
and for the legacy he leaves for the 
University of Michigan.

Scott Bell, 2003-04: During 

my time at the Michigan Daily, I 
had the opportunity to interview a 
lot of big names — from Lloyd Carr 
all the way to Bo Schembechler. 
But nothing had me worried and 
downright terrified like the time 
I was given the assignment to 
interview Red Berenson after the 
hockey team’s year-end banquet. 
None of the normal beat writers 
were available, and I was a very 
eager — albeit very green (that’s 
another word for terrible) — 
freshman reporter that was very 
familiar with the Berenson stare. 
But Red put up with my stumbling 
and stuttering because he knew I 
was prepared and he knew I was 
familiar with his team. And no 
matter how gruff he may have been 
on the exterior, all he really wanted 
was people who respected his team 
and his sport, and he’d return that 
respect tenfold. 

Brady McCollough, 2001-02: 

As a 19-year-old sophomore, you 
could only learn so much from the 
Daily’s senior sports editors. Red 
Berenson took it upon himself to 
teach a very valuable lesson to each 
writer who was lucky enough to 
cover his hockey team: The more 
you put in, the more you get out. 
Red expected us to be there every 
practice, and he definitely took note 
which of us took advantage of the 
access he offered. I actually decided 
I wanted to be a journalist within 
a few months of joining the beat, 
which was no coincidence. It was a 
special feeling being taken seriously 

by such a legend.

Red 

Berenson played a role in me having 
my dream job now. It was the time I 
spent covering Michigan hockey as 
a sophomore in 2000 that sparked 
my interest in wanting to become 
a sportswriter. I learned a lot from 
Red in his daily talks with us. He 
was so gracious with his time, 
especially if you showed up for 
practice. Which I almost always did. 
He was a little intimidating at the 
time, but I learned how to be a pro. 
And grew a passion for the sport I 
still have today. Thank you Red.

information 

director,w 2013-16: There was 
nothing quite like listening to 
Red Berenson talk hockey. If ever 
there was a man to connect hockey 
and Michigan’s past, present, and 
future, it was Red, a man who 
fondly recalled driving a tractor 
back in Saskatchewan as a boy as 
easily as a goal scored by Dylan 
Larkin in a Red Wings game the 
night before. For any reporter with 
the opportunity to interview Red in 
recent years, it was a treat, a chance 
to hear a story from a man who 
embodies well over a half century 
of hockey history. I know because I 
tried to sit in on every interview he 
gave, not because I needed to, but 
because I didn’t want to miss any 
one of those great hockey stories or 
nuggets of hockey wisdom. I think 
the biggest reason Red connected so 
well with players a quarter his age 
towards the end of his career was 
a shared passion for the University 
and the program he embodied. 
After a weekend sweep, that passion 
was never so evident than in the 
locker room and look of absolute joy 
on Red’s face in the huddle with the 
guys, singing The Victors. This is 
the source of one of my favorite Red 
Berenson moments. Michigan won 
the 2015 GLI, and the team had just 
completed “singing the song,” when 
a rap song was put on by one of the 
players in the room (I believe it was 
Up on a Tuesday). Red with a big 
smile on his face, turned to Michael 
Downing and asked him – “What 
does that mean?” Downing tried to 
explain but couldn’t come up with 
the words - he might has well have 
been speaking a different language 
to Red.

A hockey legend, and the ultimate 

Michigan Man, I’ll never forget the 
three years I had the opportunity to 
spend around his program.
