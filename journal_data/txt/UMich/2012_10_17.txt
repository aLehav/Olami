TAYLOR, Mich. - From
inside the hall of a local chap-
ter of the United Auto Workers,

the second presidential debate
between Republican presiden-
tial nominee Mitt Romney and
President Barack Obama Tues-
day night was contentious from
the start.
When Romney, the pre-
sumed victor of the first debate,
appeared on the projector in
front of the about 150 UAW
members in attendance, as well
as U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.), jeers rang out across the
hall. When Obama appeared,

the crowd was quick to erupt
in support, and throughout the
debate it occasionally broke into
cheers of "Four more years!"
Though partisan in nature,
the mood froma
the gathering
of UAW mem-
bers mirrored 2012
the tone of the
debate, held at
Hofstra Uni-

debate, the candidates were
more combative and spirited
than their previous contest.
Obama and Romney clashed
fiercely on every question, often
interrupting each other and the
moderator and accusing each
other of lying about the other's
policies.

debate, the candidates sparred

While many voters will be
focused on the presidential can-
didates this wlection Day, Michi-
gan residents will also have the
opportunity to weigh in on Pro-
posal 1, which will presentvoters
with a referendum of Public Act
4, more commonly known as the
emergency manager law.
The proposal will allow voters

controversial policy, which was
signed by Republican Gov. Rick

discontent with some of the law's
effects, such as the manager's

Voters are closely divided on
the issue as about 45 percent of
registered voters support keep-

percent support its repeal and
about 8 percent are undecided,
according to a telephone poll of
600 registered Michigan vot-
ers conducted between Sept. 10
and Sept. 15 by the Marketing
Research Group - a Lansing-
based political communications
firm.
Along partisan lines the num-
bers were more decisive - about
40 percent of self-identified
Republicans, about 34 percent of
independents and about 24 per-
cent of Democrats supported the

Draft sexual
misconduct
policy released
by 'U' officials

THE BIG HOUSE AFTER DARK

Premlinary version
of proposal outlines
protocol
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
After eight months of
research, a team of University
officials composed a draft policy
on how the University will han-
dle allegations of sexual miscon-
duct among students.
Officials - supported by E.
Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for student
affairs, and Suellyn Scarnec-
chia, a special adviser to the
University president and clini-
cal professor of law - assembled
last fall in response to guidance
from the U.S. Department of
Education's Office for Civil
Rights. The Department of Edu-
cation made suggestions about
how colleges and universities
should respond to sexual mis-
conduct allegations.
The group consists of repre-

sentatives from the University's
Departmentof Public Safety, the
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center, the Office
of Student Conflict Resolu-
tion and the Dean of Students'
Office.
Though there is no set time
when the policy will become
official, the University will
hold forums to allow for com-
munity feedback on the draft
and consider changes as the
first step toward finalizing the
protocol.
According to University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald the
"major change" in the new draft
policy is in two key areas: how
an investigation is started and
what is used as the standard of
evidence.
The draft policy proposes
that the University's Title IX
coordinator examine allegations
of sexual misconduct. Under the
previous policy, an investiga-
tion could only move forward
if the complainant approved.
However, under the new policy,

While many students chose
to spend their Fall Break visit-
ing home or catching up on their
studies, the University's chap-
ter of College Democrats cam-
paigned for votes in Ohio, a key
swing state in the upcoming elec-
tion.
About 30 members traveled to
Akron, Ohio to knock on doors
and make phone calls to promote
the re-election of U.S. Rep. Betty
Sutton (D-Ohio) and President
Barack Obama. Sutton is against
incumbent U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci
(R-Ohio), in a district that was
redrawn following the last U.S.
Census. According to members
of College Democrats, Sutton's
stance on higher education and
health care is especially benefi-
cial to students.

For Engineering. senior
Grant Schroll, the co-founder
of the Happiness Initiative,
the club isn't about hugs and
good feelings - it's about
implementing change in peo-
ple's lives.
"What we aim to do is to
provide an environment and
resources for college students
to get together and talk about
issues that lead to genuine,
wholehearted happiness in
our lives," Schroll said.
It may sound idyllic, but
the University's chapter of the
nationwide Happiness Initia-
tive is planning a variety of
ways to bring its in-house

body. Though the club was
just developed last year by
Schroll, LSA senior Yianni
Ellenikiotis and Engineering
senior Pete Wangwongwiroj,
it has since grown to approxi-
mately 20 regular members
per meeting.
One of the most recent
activities the group complet-
ed was a journaling of their
positive weekly experiences.
Schroll said when the group
came together and discussed
their findings, group mem-
bers reported everything
from decreased stress to bet-
ter sleep because everything
felt more "lighthearted."
"When they actually took

the time to think about how
their experiences were good
or meaningful, they tended to
be happier and they tended to
have more meaningful inter-
actions with people," Schroll
said.
He added that later this
year the group will partner
with other campus organiza-
tions and the Office of Student
Affairs to sponsor "Happi-
ness Week" activities. Later,
the Happiness Initiative will
also sponsor an "open-forum"
TedX style event for students
to share their "inspiring and
unique stories."

Officialst tofind Sht .
of huge meningitis outbreak -

a

Contaminated
steroids have killed
15 and sickened
more than 200
NEW YORK (AP) - Was it'
some moldy ceiling tiles? The
dusty shoes of a careless employ-
ee? Or did the contamination
ride in on one of the ingredients?
There are lots of ways fun-
gus could have gotten inside the
Massachusetts compounding
pharmacy whose steroid medi-
cation has been linked to alethal
outbreak of a rare fungal form of
meningitis.
The outbreak has killed at
least 15 people and sickened
more than 200 others in 15
states. Nearly all the victims had
received steroid injections for
back pain.
Federal and state investiga-
tors have been tightlipped about
any problems they may have
seen at the New England Com-
*Ef

pounding Center or whether
they have pinpointed the source
of the contamination. They did
disclose last week that they
found fungus in more than 50
vials from the pharmacy.
Company spokesman Andrew
Paven said by email that crimi-
nal investigators from the Food
and Drug Administration were
at the pharmacy in Framing-
ham, Mass., on Tuesday. The
visit was part of a broad federal
and state investigation of the
outbreak, FDA spokesman Ste-
ven Immergut said in an email.-
New England Compounding
has not commented on its pro-
duction process or what }night
have gone wrong, so outside
experts can only speculate. But
the betting money seems to
be on dirty conditions, faulty
sterilizing equipment, tainted
ingredients or sloppiness on the
part of employees.
The drug at the center of the
investigation is made without
preservative, meaning there's
no alcohol or other solution in
5-m

it to kill germs such as a fungus.
So it's very important that it be
made under highly sterile condi-
tions, experts said.
Compounding pharmacies
aren't as tightly regulated as
drug company plants, but they
are supposed to follow certain
rules: Clean the floors and other
surfaces daily; monitor air in
"clean rooms" where drugs
are made; require employees
to wear gloves and gowns; test
samples from each lot.
The rules are in the U.S. Phar-
macopeia, a kind of national
standards book for compound-
ing medicines that's written by
a nonprofit scientific organiza-
tion. Most inspections, though,
are handled by state boards of
pharmacy. Massachusetts last
inspected New England Com-
pounding in March in response
to a complaint unrelated to the
outbreak; the results have not
been released.
High-volume production of
the sort that went on at New
England Compounding also
raises the chances of contami-
nation, experts said.
Traditionally, compounding
pharmacies fill special orders
placed by doctors for individual
patients, turning out maybe five
or six vials. But many medical
practices and hospitals place
large orders to have the medi-
cines on hand for their patients.
That's allowed in at least 40
states but not under Massachu-
setts regulations.
Last month, New England
Compounding recalled three
lots of steroids made since May
that totaled 17,676 single-dose
vials of medicine - roughly
equivalent to 20 gallons.
"I don't see it as appropri-
ate for a community pharmacy
to do a batch of something pre-
servative-free in numbers in
the thousands" of doses, said
Lou Diorio, a New Jersey-based
consultant to compounding
pharmacies. Diorio, who has no
connection to the investigation
or the company, said it is harder
to keep everything sterile when
working with large amounts.

A woman shows her passport and that of her son to reporters as she leaves an immigration office io Havana, Cuba,
Tuesday, Oct 16, 2012.
Cuban citizs now allowed to
travel abroad without exit visas

Policy reverses
50 year old rule
preventing free
foreign travel
HAVANA (AP) - The Cuban
government announced Tues-
day that it will eliminate a half-
century-old restriction that
requires citizens to get an exit
visa to leave the country.
The decree that takes effect
Jan. 14 will eliminate a much-
loathed bureaucratic procedure
that has keptmany Cubans from
traveling or moving abroad.
"These measures are truly
substantial and profound," said
Col. Lamberto Fraga, Cuba's
deputy chief of immigration,
at a morning news conference.
"What we are doing is not just
cosmetic."
Under the new measure
announced in the Communist
Party daily Granma, islanders
will only have to show their
passport and a visa from the
country they are traveling to.
It is the most significant
advance this year in President
Raul Castro's five-year plan of
reforms that has already seen
the legalization of home and

car sales and a big increase in
the number of Cubans owning
private businesses.
Migration is a highly politi-
cized issue in Cuba and beyond
its borders.
Under the "wet foot, dry
foot" policy, the United States
allows nearly all Cubans who
reach its territory to remain.
Granma published an edito-
rial blaming the travel restric-
tions imposed in 1961 on U.S.
attempts to topple the island's
government, plant spies and
recruit its best-educated citi-
zens.
"It is because of this that any
analysis of Cuba's problematic
migration inevitably passes
through the policy of hostility
that the U.S. government has
developed against the country
for more than 50 years," the
editorial said.
It assured Cubans that the
government recognizes their
right to travel abroad and said
the new measure is part of "an
irreversible process of normal-
ization of relations between
emigrants and their homeland."
The decree still imposes lim-
its on travel by many Cubans.
People cannot obtain a pass-
port or travel abroad without
permission if they face crimi-

nal charges, if the trip affects
national security or if their
departure would affect efforts
to keep qualified labor in the
country.
Doctors, scientists, mem-
bers of the military and others
considered valuable parts of
society currently face restric-
tions on travel to combat brain
drain.
"The update to the migra-
tory policy takes into account
the right of the revolutionary
State to defend itself from the
interventionist and subversive
plans of the U.S. government
and its allies," the newspaper
said. "Therefore, measures
will remain to preserve the
human capital created by the
Revolution in the face of the
theft of talent applied by the
powerful."
On the streets of Havana, the
news was met with a mixture of
delight and astonishment. Offi-
cials over the years often spoke
of their desire to lift the exit
visa, but talk failed to turn into
concrete change.
"No! Wow, how great!" said
Mercedes Delgado, a 73-year-
old retiree when told of the
news that was announced
overnight. "Citizens' rights are
being restored."

probe air defenses and collect

official rejected the account.
The Iranian official declined
to give further details on the
purported missions or the capa-

whether they were similar to the
unmanned aircraft launched last
week by Lebanon's Hezbollah and
downed by Israeli warplanes. It
also was impossible to indepen-

official, who spoke on condition

 Thieves make
off with valuable
Picasso, Monet
Thieves broke into a Rotter-

walked off with works from the
likes of Picasso, Monet, Gauguin
and Matisse potentially worth
hundreds of millions.
Police haven't said how they
pulled off the early hours heist,
but an expert who tracks stolen
art said the robbers clearly knew
what they were after.
"Those thieves got one hell of a
haul," said Chris Marinello, who
directs the Art Loss Register.
The heist at the Kunsthal
museum is one of the largest in
years in the Netherlands, and is a
stunning blow for the private Tri-
ton Foundation collection, which
was being exhibited publicly as a
 group for the first time.
"It's every museum director's
worst nightmare," said Kunsthal
director Emily Ansenk, who had
been in Istanbul on business but
returned immediately.
News of the theft "struck like a

A protester gives the victory sign after scuffles broke out between groups of several hundred protesters in Tahrir square
when chants against the new Islamist president angered some in the crowd in Cairo on Oct.12.
High court pointedly criticizes
proposed Egyptian constitution

Role of religion and
the judiciary key
points of contention
with legislature
Egypt's highest court lashed
out Tuesday at an Islamist-led
panel tasked with writing the
country's new constitution,
saying that some provisions
proposed for the text undercut
the court's mandate and keep it
under the president's power.
The work - and the composi-
tion - of the 100-member con-
stitutional assembly has been
the subject of a fierce debate in
Egypt, and the country is still
haggling over disputed articles
in the charter, some of which
will determine the role of reli-
gion in the nation's affairs and the
independence ofthe judiciary.
Supporters of the panel draft-
ing the constitution say it was

set up by an elected parliament
and broadly represents Egypt's
political factions. Critics say the
process is dominated by a major-
ity made up of Islamists, such as
the Muslim Brotherhood from
which Egypt's new president,
Mohammed Morsi, hails, and
more radical groups, when it
should be more consensual.
With the nation- increas-
ingly polarized, and mistrust
between Islamists and other
groups growing, the country's
judiciary has emerged as a life-
line and final arbiter for set-
tling most disputes. More than
40 legal challenges have been
presented to the country's top
administrative court demand-
ing the dissolution of the cur-
rent panel.
Egypt's High Administrative
Court put off a widely expect-
ed decision on the challenges
Tuesday for next week, prolong-
ing the suspense over the fate
of the second panel to write

the country's new charter. An
earlier panel, also dominated
by Islamists, was dissolved in
April through the same court,
which ruled its make-up didn't
adhere to a constitutional dec-
laration designed by the coun-
try's former military rulers.
The rising influence of
the Islamists was solidified
through early parliamentary
elections in Egypt, giving them
nearly 75 percent of seats in
parliament, and subsequently,
control over the making of the
constitutional assembly, which
was drawn up by the parlia-
ment.
"Instead of a consensus
building from the outset, we got
this extreme polarization and
these elections," said Nasser
Amin, a judicial affairs expert.
"The judiciary has become the
safety valve, the only place that
everyone resorts to for settling

Guzman Salazar
may provide info
about Sinaloa
cartel in Mexico
SAN DIEGO (AP) - The
daughter of one of the world's
most sought-after drug lords
has been charged with trying
to enter the United States on
someone else's passport, U.S.
officials said, becoming the lat-
est family member to become
ensnared in U.S. courts.
Alejandrina Gisselle Guz-
man Salazar, 31, was arrest-
ed Friday at San Diego's San
Ysidro port of entry.
Two U.S. officials said Mon-
day thatshe told authorities her
father was Joaquin "El Chapo"
Guzman, the elusive leader of
Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. The
officials spoke on condition of
anonymity because they were
not authorized to discuss the "
arrest publicly.
The significance of the arrest
will depend on what Guzman
Salazar can tell authorities
about her father, like whether
she can provide phone num-
bers, said pavid Shirk, director
of the University of San Diego's
Trans-Border Institute.
"We don't know exactly
what she knows," said Shirk.
"It may just be an interesting
factoid in the war on drugs or
it could be a vital clue for law
enforcement."
Shirk noted that Benjamin
Arellano Felix , who led what
was then Mexico's most pow-
erful drug cartel, was captured
in Mexico in 2002 after author-

ities tracked his daughter to
find him.
Guzman Salazar was
charged with fraud and mis-
use of visas, permits and other
documents. The complaint
said she attempted to enter the
country on foot, presenting a
non-immigrant visa contained
in a Mexican passport. She told
authorities she was pregnant
and intended to goto Los Ange-
les to give birth to her child.
The Los Angeles Times
reported last year that Guz-
mans wife - former beauty
queen Emma Coronel - trav-
eled to Southern California and
gave birth to twin girls at Ante-
lope Valley Hospital in Lan-
caster, north of Los Angeles.
The newspaper said Coronel,
then 22, holds U.S. citizenship,
which entitles her to travel
freely to the U.S. and to use its
hospitals.
"You kind of surmise that
there's some family connection
back to Southern California,"
Eric Olson, associate director
of the Wilson Center's Mexico
Institute said of the daughter's
arrest.
The Sinaloa cartel, named
after the Pacific coast state of
the same name, controls traf-
ficking along much of the U.S.
border with Mexico, particu-
larly in Western states.
Authorities in the U.S. and
Mexico have said they believe
Guzman has children with sev-
eral partners, though it's not
clear how many. The U.S. Trea-
sury Department has put sanc-
tions on sons Ivan Archivaldo
"El Chapito" Guzman Salazar,
31, and Ovidio Guzman Lopez,
22.

Disgraced Israeli leader
poised to make comeback

Resurgence of
popular leader
complicates PM's
re-election attempt
JERUSALEM (AP) - The
popular ultra-Orthodox Israeli
politician Arieh Deri is prepar-
ing a comeback after a 13-year
hiatus that included a brief pris-
on term for accepting bribes.
A return of the former king-
maker to lead the powerful Shas
Party could complicate Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
bid for re-election: Under Deri,
who is considered to be more
dovish than Shas' current lead-
er regarding concessions to the
Palestinians, the party may no
longer be the automatic Netan-
yahu coalition ally that it has
been.
The spiritual leader of the
party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, has
yet to rule on whether Deri
will replace Shas' current chief
Eli Yishai. The two contenders
have been waging a public bat-
tle over the 92-year-old rabbi's
blessing.
If Deri is not reinstated as
leader, he is expected to start a
new party that focuses on social
welfare and could steal votes
away from Shas. Internal party
polls have suggested Shas will
fare much better in the Jan. 22
election with Deri at the helm,
according to-Israeli media.
The charismatic Deri, 53,
was a rising young star who
transformed Shas from a small,
niche party into a major factor
in Israeli politics before he went
to prison.
Two months after being con-
victed in 1999, he led Shas to a
record 17 seats in the 120-mem-
ber parliament but could not
serve in the next government,
because of his impending incar-
ceration. He spent two years
behind bars for taking bribes
from religious seminaries when
he was interior minister in
return for future financing.
At the time, Yosef announced
that Yishai would serve as a
"custodian" leader until Deri
could return to politics. -
Because of his conviction,
Deri was banned from run-

ning for office for seven years
after leaving prison. During
Deri's prolonged absence, Yis-
hai solidified his leadership
of the party and has become a
prominent minister in a series
of coalition governments.
Shas holds 11 seats in parlia-
ment, making it a midsize but
still influential party.
Yishai, who currently serves
as Netanyahu's interior min-
ister, is more strongly aligned
with the hawkish elements
of Israeli politics who oppose
broad concessions to the Pal-
estinians. Deri is seen as more
moderate, having served in the
late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin's government when the
peace process with the Pales-
tinians began in the early 1990s.
Roi Lachmanovitch, a former
Shas spokesman who served
under Yishai, said he wasn't
certain Deri would strengthen
the party's prospects.
"At the end it all depends on
the rabbi's decision and it is not
based on polls," he said. "It is a
principled ruling: Do you stick
with the current loyal leader
or reconnect with the mythical
leader of the past?"
A split would hurt the party,
and attempts were being made
to find a compromise that would
keep both men happy. The cur-
rent formula looks to have Deri
head the party, with Yishai
remaining its most senior Cabi-
net minister in the next govern-
ment.
As interior minister, respon-
sible for the country's immigra-
tion policies, Yishai has been a
controversial figure. He has led
a much-criticized crackdown
on African migrants and was.
also harshly criticized in an
official report for failures in the
government's response to a for-
est fire that killed 44 people in
2010. The Interior Ministry is in
charge of the nation's firefight-
ing force.
Shas has historically held
enough seats to guarantee the
sitting prime minister a major-
ity in parliament. It has lev-
eraged this influence to win
powerful ministries with large
budgets that can be directed to
its core constituency of poorer,
religious Jews of Mizrahi, or
Middle Eastern, descent.

Necessary mod1fications
Politicial debates lack substance and accuracy
f the recent presidential and vice presidential debates have
accomplished anything, they've proven that the American
public continually struggles to interpret the candidates's rhet-
oric. There have now been three debates, and the common thread is
that specific and comprehensive answers are infrequent. The candi-
dates have thus far quickly reverted to usual talking points on the
growing problems that face America, such as Medicare and the war
in Afghanistan. These political debates lack the substance that they
should be providing to the American public. Debates aren't efficient-
ly structured and their.format should be modified so candidates can
discuss a variety of important issues more in depth.

Unity from tragedy

This past week, the story of
Malala Yousafzai has dom-
inated most major news
ietworks. The

14-year-old girl
was shot by Tal-
iban militants
for raising her
voice against
their repressive
policies. She
was advocating
for the simple
right to eduac-
tion. Apparent-
ly, the Taliban

HARSHA
NAHATA

saw her as a threat - she was shot
at on her way home from school
last week. Yousafzai is currently
being treated for her wounds in
the United Kingdom.
What happened with Malala
is nothing short of a tragedy. But
maybe the only positive that comes
out of tragedies like this is an oppor-
tunity for us all to rally together, to
unify. And in this case, that is exact-
ly what has been done.
The international community has
responded with unanimous condem-
nation, and multiple nations have
offered help with Malala's treat-
ment. Starting with an airlift offered
by the United Arab Emirates to her
final treatment in the United King-
dom, there's been an overwhelming
outpouring of support worldwide.
The strongest voices of condem-
nation have come from within Paki-
stan itself. From lawyers, to media,
to religious clerics to the citizens
of Pakistan, there has been sharp
criticism of the Taliban's targeting
of Malala. People have taken to the
streets in protest to show their sup-
port. Lawyers took a day off from
court to join in the protests. More
than 50 Islamic scholars from the
Sunni Ittehad Council condemned
the attack. Deseret, a Pakistani
newspaper, ran an editorial on
Tuesday, Oct. 16, calling Malala a
Pakistani hero. In fact, Pakistani

media has so strongly condemned
the attacks as to elicit threats from
the Taliban themselves. Even Paki-
stani President Zardari condemned
the attack.
The outcry hasn'f been limited to
Pakistan. Around the world, news
media, political figures and the pub-
lic have voiced outrage over what
happened to Malala. Beyond the
contentious relationship that India
and Pakistan might share, there
were even protests in India against
such horrific actions by the Taliban.
In a way, this outcry is expected.
You might be wondering why I'm
spending so much space describ-
ing ,something so obvious. Who
wouldn't condemn such a horrific
act? Regardless of what one may
believe politically, ideologically or
religiously, it's easy to agree that tar-
geting a 14-year-old girl is hardly an
acceptable practice. But what's sig-
nificant is exactly that - that across
national borders, religious ideals and
political differences, with theecase
of Malala Yousafzai, we all found
something to agree on.
In fact, if we look deeply, there
are a lot of somethings we agree on.
Most would agree that every child,
boy or girl, should have access to
education, that people should be free
to speak their mind without fear of
being killed, that people should be
able to work, earn a living and pro-
vide for their families. In short, in
some ways, we can agree that there
are basic things that go into a qual-
ity standard of living that everyone
should be able to enjoy. We only dis-
agree on the best way to get there.
And that's what tragedies such as
this show us. They show us that we
might be fiercely different inmany of
our beliefs, but often time we're all
fighting for the same thing: a better
tomorrow than we have today.
There's a lesson in the story of
Malala. A lesson we can apply to
the political situation in the -United
States. There are lots of political and

social issues we argue about today.
And given the partisan political cli-
mate ofthe United States,you'd think
that the Republicans and Democrats
agree on next to nothing.
We're all fighting
for the same
thing: abetter
tomorrow.

a

But in the end, both parties want
the same thing - a better future for
this country. None of the candidates
disagree that we want American
youth to have top quality education,
that we want people to be employed,
that we want safe and structurally
soundroads and infrastructure,that
we want to return to having the best
and most competitive workforce
in the world. We don't disagree on
these end goals; we only disagree on
how to get there.
In ohe midst of an election sea-
son, politicians would rather have
us focus on what we disagree on
than what we see eye-to-eye on. But
the truth is, if we keep focusing on
'what we disagree about, we won't
ever be able to solve the problems
at hand.
It's sad that time and time again it
takes us a tragedy to realize this, but
underneath all the ways in which
we identify as different from one
another, there are basics that we
can agree on. And in this election
season, keeping in mind Malala's
story, perhaps we should look for
the areas we agree on so we can
make valuable compromises.

The first two debates demonstrated how
inconsequential they have become in recent
years. In the first presidential debate, mod-
erator Jim Lehrer failed to foster a struc-
tured debate. Both candidates exceeded time
limits, failed to provide direct answers to
questions and repeatedly spoke over Lehrer.
While Martha Raddatz proved to be a better
moderator, Vice President Joe Biden and Paul
Ryan failed to provide direct and complete
answers to some questions.
Future debates could be improved by hav-
ing fact-checking take place at the event.
In the first presidential debate, President
Obama and Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney argued about whether or not
the fiscal claims they'd made along the cam-
paign trail were correct. This process took up
a large portion of the debate and detracted
from policy. If someone was there to verify
the validity of the candidates's claims, mod-
erators could speed up the debate and actu-
ally discuss important issues that pertain
to the campaign. This will force candidates
to know the truth and allow voters to make
informed decisions.

It also may be time to give moderators
more authority in debates. In the vice presi-
dential debate, the candidates were allowed
to stray from the actual questions and move
to their respective talking points, which has
become an important feature of politics. If
the candidates are allowed to simply talk
over the moderator, the debate will have no
structure and trickier issues can be avoided.
After all, the whole point of a debate is to per-
suade the public as best you can with the time
you're alloted. If that element is eliminated,
debates will become media events for the
candidates as opposed to an opportunity to
properly evaluate candidates.
The American public will choose its next
president on Nov. 6. However, it's unlike-
ly that the political debates will provide
people the information they need to make
informed decisions about two very differ-
ent views of America's future. Going for-
ward, if these changes are implemented,
the presidential debates may again become
relevant to the campaign cycle. In the end,
the debates will be a much better resource
for undecided voters.

Fulfillment through respect

A'game-changing' semester

In Jeffrey McMahon's viewpoint, he
responds to Bethany Biron's article on hook-up
culture. The resulting flurry of Facebook activ-
ity made it clear that many women on carpus
are not pleased. They accurately pointed out
that this example of benevolent sexism may
come off as "nice," but it reinforces this idea
that women aren't able to handle themselves
and need men to take care of them.
There are parts of McMahon's viewpoint
that we should learn from. The piece clearly
comes from an authentic place that is worth
noting, regardless of if we agree with him.
First, as he points out, he and many men par-
ticipate in hook-up culture and aren't satis-
fied. He also puts forward that men have a
role to play in improving the gendered nature
of relationships. What he missed, however,
was that the alternative to hook-up culture
doesn't have to be a 1950s white middle-class
fantasy of marriage. So, this is a challenge for
the men on campus (straight and not straight)
who are or aren't satisfied, who want to be
supportive of women and trans people, and
want to be fulfilled in their sexual and/or
romantic relationship to push a little more
critically and imagine new possibilities. Here
are a few starting points:
Whoever you're involved with, treat them
as a person. This applies to all people, but
men often need the reminder. If you're "hook-
ing up," whoever you're hooking up with is
not just an object for your desire. You aren't
entitled to have sex with anyone, and every-
one comes in with their own wishes and a
need for respect of their bodies. It also means
that if you're involved emotionally, it's not
necessarily your responsibility to take care
of them. There's a difference between caring
for someone and taking care of them. Caring
for someone involves respecting their needs,
honoring them as a person and knowing that
they are capable human beings. We all need
care, no matter our gender. Taking care of
someone, means that you're assuming they
need something from you, and often comes
with the expectation that they owe you.
Challenge yourself to find what works
for you, acknowledge what works for other
people and dare to be different. As McMa-

hon points out, the hook-up culture isn't
for everyone. It's for some people when it's
negotiated intentionally. Some people want
to have sex, some people want to have some
sort of emotional involvement, some of our
peers are happily married. Most people have
some combination of those desires and oth-
ers. What matters is that you're able to sift
through all of the peer pressure and expecta-
tions to find what you want. It might change
tomorrow. Your best friend might want some-
thing different. You're going to have to think
about it more than once. And you can't just
figure it out-you have to have the courage to
be different, to feel weird and to voice that dif-
ference. For some of us, this means struggling
with expectations that are part of daunting
systems of racism, sexism and heterosexism.
And then, assuming you want something that
involves other people, you have to go through
the process again to ensure you're both clear
on what the other person wants.
Give up some of your masculine power. As
men, we often don't feel powerful, but it's in
those moments when we don't feel powerful
that we often grasp for control. So when you
feel vulnerable or confused, open up to your
friends, especially if they're also men. And
start listening to women and trans people.
It's easy to write off what others say in order
to defend yourself, but listen and understand
first. To take this even further, acknowledge
that listening requires the work of encour-
aging voices that aren't always heard. We're
bombarded by images of hook-up culture and
unequal power dynamics in relationships.
So take a minute to acknowledge what's not
being expressed with words.
If we want to have sexual-romantic and
sexual-non-romantic relationships that are
fulfilling, it's time to dig deeper than all the
images available to us, whether they seem
"nice" or not, and find ways to relate to each
other without demeaning each other.

When I decided to do the Semes-
ter In Detroit program last spring,
I was met with laughter by many
of my family and friends. "Oh, so
you're going home for the summer"
and "What do they have to teach
you about Detroit?" were common
responses. In reality, hailing from
the city of Detroit didn't disqualify
me from gaining valuable experi-
ences through SID. And similarly,
never having been to Detroit doesn't
disqualify you. Neither does being
afraid of Detroit. Or knowing a lot
about Detroit. This program is a
game-changer, an experience that
can shape not only the rest of your
academic career, but your life.
It was the internship that first
caught my attention - a chance to
gain valuable work experience from
innovative and prestigious growing
companies and non-profit organiza-
tions. SID's reputation helped me get
an internship at Pewabic Pottery, a
non-profit ceramics organization,
and gave my supervisor the con-

fidence to give me a great amount
of freedom and responsibility in
my work. From hosting television
crews to climbing in fish tanks at
the Belle Isle Aquarium, the expe-
rience I gained from my internship
was priceless and escorted me into
a new way of engaging with my city
through the professional world. For
anyone, the SID internship is a snap-
shot into what working in Detroit,
or any other similar environment,
might be like.
Class, often the greatest burden
in a student's life, was the glue that
brought all the richness of the SID
experiences together. Instead of
detracting from our engagement in
the city, our classes were the place
where we could process our experi-
ences and learn about the city in a
way that would deepen and shape
our interactions going forward.
From the first night sleeping on
the floor of a church during orienta-
tion, to the last night of the program
laying on my apartment floor talking

until sunrise, my SID crew was the
absolute best part of the whole expe-
rience. Each person had a unique
background, interests and relation-
ship to the city and together we had
a diversity 'that provided for the
most interesting group experience
I've been a part of. Despite our dif-
ferences, the SID group had a com-
mitment to supporting one another's
endeavors and learning about their
passions. Not a personal success has
gone by, even now, that hasn't been
celebrated by the group.
Wherever' you're at, SID has
something for you. A place to
learn. To network. To risk. To
grow. If I could do it again, I
would, but since I can't, I'd love to
see you go. Apply by Oct. 26 for the
winter semester, and if you still
need some convincing, there is
an info session at 7 p.m. in Mason
Hall G437 on Thursday, Oct. 18.

the extreme measure of replacing
elected officials with an appoint-
ed manager from the governor's
office, there should be objective
criteria ... rather than subjective
criteria."
Irwin added that it is difficult
to predict voter support of such
a measure, stating that the aver-
age constituent typically doesn't
closely follow municipal finance.
Still, he noted there are many peo-
ple in districts with financial man-
agers who have expressed concern
about how public services will be
affected by the change.
In a video statement released
on Oct. 10, Lt. Governor Brian Cal-
ley called on voters to consider the
necessity of financial organization
in troubled municipalities.
"This is a tool that is in place
in order to give an early warning
indicator to provide for additional
help and security for schools and
cities that fall into financial dis-
tress." Calley said. "This is a criti-
cal part of the reinvention of the
state of Michigan."
In a panel discussion at the Uni-
versity last year, Howard Ryan,
the director of legislative affairs
in the Michigan Department of
Treasury, said though munici-
palities oppose having Lansing-
appointed officials, dire financial
situations within certain districts
have made it necessary.
"(The) provisions (are) there to
allow flexibility for local units of
government," Ryan said lastyear.
LSA senior Rachel Jankowski,
chair of the University's chapter
of College Republicans, said the
group does not have an official
stance on Public Act 4 given the
fact that it isn't a decisively parti-
san issue.
However, speaking personally,
she said she understands Snyder's
push for intervention when situa-
tions are dismal.
"If there's a failing institution
we need someone to come in and
kind of revamp it," Jankowski
said.
The University's chapter
of College Democrats did not
return requests for comment as
of Tuesday afternoon.

RENOVATIONS
The regents will also consid-

munication, the $2-million
proposed upgrade will focus
solely on upgrades to the build-

system.
"This project will upgrade
the substation and a number of
electrical motor control cen-
ters, switchboards, and recep-
tacle and lighting panels to
meet current code and safety
requirements," Slottow wrote.
The project will also be bud-
geted to include upgrades to the
adjacent Fletcher Street Park-

approve the motion, Slottow
estimated that the project
would be completed by winter
of 2014.

REGENTS TO
AUTHORIZE ALCOHOL
FOR WINTER CLASSIC
The regents' agenda will
also include the authorization
of University officials to seek
a temporary liquor license for
the National Hockey League's
Winter Classic. The Winter
Classic is the NHL's flagship
outdoor game, and is planned
for Jan. 1, 2013 at Michigan
Stadium. This year's matchup
will pit the Detroit Red Wings
against the Toronto Maple
Leafs. Michigan's hosting of
the Winter Classic will depend
upon the resolution of the NHL
lockout, which has resulted in
the cancellation of regularly
scheduled games.
Due to a change to the Mich-
igan Liquor Control Code, the
regents must now directly issue
temporary liquor licenses for
special events at Michigan Sta-
dium, Slottow wrote in a com-
munication to the regents.
"Under the Michigan Liquor
Control Code, the Board of
Regents must provide local
government approval for the
concessionaire's application
for the liquor license," Slottow
wrote.
According to Slottow's com-
munication, Sodexo Manage-
ment Inc. will provide catering
and beverage services at the
event, pending regental approv-

After Qbama said Romney

did in fact let the automakers go

As Obama responded that
Romney would have let Detroit go

from the crowd.

LSA sophomore Jacob Light,
the press chair for the College
Democrats, said the club chose to

"(The congressional election) is
now one of the most heated races
in the nation and we want to show
some support and show that even
though it's a different state, the
issues that people are facing in
that race are issues that we're fac-
ing all over the nation," Light said.
Light said the College Demo-
crats contacted 3,000 Ohio vot-
ers via door-to-door canvassing
or phone calls, adding that some
voters responded positively to the
solicitations for Sutton and Obama
andexpressed appreciation for the
efforts of the students.
"Ohio residents really respond-
ed to the fact that we came from

In an interview after the
debate, Dingell praised Obama's
aggressiveness in challenging
Romney.
"He was more direct in dealing
with Romney, which I thought
was not only good, but wise and
necessary and effective," Dingell
said.
Rory Gamble, the UAW Region
IA director, said Obama coun-
tered his sub-par performance in
the first presidential debate with a
strong rebuff of Romney Tuesday
night.
"He was a lot more force-
ful, and more factual and right-
to-the-point - he showed the
aggressiveness that we need in a
president," Gamble said. "I think
tonight we saw the real President
Obama."
Aaron Kall, the director of the
University's debate program, said
in a telephone interview that the
format of the face-off, Obama's
aggressiveness and the frequent
appearance of social issues that
favor Obama all added up to a win-
ning night for the president.
Still, Kall said that Obama's
concern should not be if he won

LSA senior Yonah Lieberman
said the campaigners were wel-
comed as a fresh alternative to the
barrage of advertisements that
have been infiltrating the state.
"People (in Akron), more than

really sick of hearing ads," Lieber-
man, who is also a Michigan Daily
columnist, said. "Which makes us
coming to see them face-to-face
about issues that are relevant to
them all the more important."
Lieberman said decided and
undecided voters engaged the
students in discussions about the
issues within Sutton and Obama's
campaigns.
He added that he was satisfied
with his decision to canvass over

man said. "But I'm really glad that

However, LSA senior Jared
Boot, the chair of the University's
chapter of Students for Romney,
said he thought Romney carried

beg to differ.
He said Romney maintained
his assertiveness while besting
Obama on questions involving

the candidates' stances on how

"Speaking as the voice of mod-

Boot referred to polls that
reveal Romney narrowing the
gap with Obama in critical swing
states, including Michigan, and
speculated that Romney would
hold his position in polls after the

"The first debate, Romney had

Ann Arbor Mayor John Hief-

along with City Councilmember
Sandi Smith (D-Ward 1) - said
in an interview that the.study is
vital to improving Ann Arbor's
transit system and ensuring that
the city remains environmentally
focused.
"I've been pushing for
enhanced and better transit ever
since I got into office and we've
made a lot of progress," Hieftje
said. "But I think we need to do
more ... our job base continues to
grow. There are goingto be 1,000
to 1,500 new jobs in Ann Arbor
each year and if we don't work on
the transit, people will be driv-
ing their cars into town and we'll
have to build more parking struc-
tures."
Hieftje said if the study pro-
duces a project in the future, the
benefit would extend to all city
residents, not just those affiliated
with the University.
"Underclassmen won't be here
when this gets built," Hieftje said.
"...but certainly future students
and the whole city as a whole will
benefit if this happens."
Hieftje added that he is not
concerned that the Council may
ultimately choose to deny the
funds.
"There may be another way
to find the funding," Hieftje
said. "Could be a local group, the
AATA could fund more or the U
of M."
He added that if the city
decides to pursue a transit proj-
ect from the study's results, the
project would have an 80 per-
cent match rate from the Michi-
gan government. However, he
said the first goal would be to
see what kind of improvement, if
any, is necessary.
"We won't know if that will
work or not unless we take this
next step," Hieftje said.
ON


from general fund
to project
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Following four years of
research, applications for
grants and continuous discus-
sion with the University, the
Ann Arbor City Council voted
8-2 in favor to spend $550,000
from the city's general fund
toward preliminary study and
planning for a second rail sta-
tion in Ann Arbor.
The idea for the additional
rail station - which will join
the current station located on
Depot Street - stems from a
proposed plan in 2008 between
the University and the city to
pursue supplementary trans-
portation and parking services.
The proposal arose as part of an
effort to address the burgeon-
ing need for transit and parking
space with the completion of
the C. S. Mott Children's Hospi-
tal and Von Voigtlander Wom-
en's Hospital, which opened
last year.
The University's Board of
Regents canceled the initial
2009 project, which entailed
construction of a parking
structure on Wall Street and
collaboration with the Fuller
Road Intermodal Station proj-
ect. However, the board revis-
ited the project in April and
approved construction plans,
which will cost an estimated
$34 million.
In addition to the struc-
ture, many city officials have
expressed support for a sec-
ond train station, noting it
is an important opportunity
for growth within the city.
Monday's resolution provides
matching funds of $550,000 in
conjunction with $2.2 million
from, the federal High-Speed
Intercity Passenger Rail pro-
gram funding for a $2.75 mil-
lion total.
Council spent considerable
time discussing the issue at its

hearings before the final vote
was held, garnering the eight
votes necessary to pass. Coun-
cilmember Stephen Kunselman
(Ward-3) was the only member
absent from the meeting.
In the initial stages of discus-
sion, Councilmember Christo-
pher Taylor (D-Ward 3) argued
that moving forward with the
rail station after years of dis-
cussion would be more effec-
tive than continuing to delay
the project.
"Although it has been a little
bit of a circuitous path to get
here, we have the means to
make this match now and the
goal is equally important to
Ann Arbor's future," he said.
"You can't have progress with-
out investment."
Previously, the resolution
stated that Ann Arbor residents
would vote on moving forward
with the train station. Before
the resolution was voted on,
Councilmember Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) added an amend-
ment that stipulates that the
vote by residents comes after
the city's study is conducted,
and would additionally halt
progress on the train station if
a majority voted no.
She emphasized the need for
schematic research to be con-
ducted in order to allow voters
to make informed decisions on
whether or not a second train
station would be justified.
"If we brought forward a
notional concept on a vote on
should we build a train station
any rational person could come
back to 'Where would it be?
What will it look like? How big
will it be? How much is it going
to cost?"' Briere said. "That's
why we don't go looking today
for that vote saying 'Should we
build a train station?"'
Because the residential vote
is now contingent on the com-
pletion of schematic designs
and studies, it will likely be sev-
eral years before voters see any.
ballot language on this issue,
Taylor said in an interview dur-
ing an intermission.

Decision will meeting Monday night. Coun-
cilmembers also listened to
allocate $550,000 several residents speak for and
against the resolution in public

Councilmember Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) argued strongly
against the resolution, claiming
that the money the city would
spend is another financial bur-
den toward a project lacking
direction.
"In June we were assured
in no uncertain terms that
the previous cost the city had
absorbed related to this proj-
ect would qualify as the match
for this grant and no new city
money would be required," she
said. "Well guess what, the past
costs don't qualify and we need
to put up another $550,000 of q
your tax dollars to satisfy their
local match."
She also challenged the
speed at which the resolution
- which was introduced on
Friday - moved through the
Council, and said it was too
accelerated.
"At some point one concludes
it's time to stop throwing good
money after bad or at least hit
pause until there's a plan,"
Lumm said. "I believe we are
way past that point."
Lumm noted that accounting
for the $550,000 in this reso-
lution, the city will have spent
$2.7 million of its total funds
toward this project.
Still, Councilmember
Carsten Hohnke (D-Ward 5)
posited that residents want to
see a second rail station.
"I think the significant con-
sensus out there is that mov-
ing forward with investment in
high-speed rail are the right to
do," he said.
He addressed concerns
raised from a community mem-
ber that spending the $550,000
would be a "gamble" consider-
ing the total cost of the project
would be too much for the city.
Hohnke countered the concern
and said once a final projection
is determined, national and
state funding would be avail-
able to help pay for the station.
During discussion of the res-
olution, Eli Cooper, Ann Arbor
transportation program man-
ager, fielded questions from the
Council regarding a second rail
station's feasibilityi
Cooper said in an interview
during an intermission that the
preliminary cost for the project
totals $42 million.
"For this particular project
since we don't have a site, these .
are very conceptual numbers
but it gives us a frame of ref-
erence," Cooper said. "Plus or
minus 20 to 30 percent, that's
the cost of the project we might
expect when we get done with
the planning process."
He noted that even with fed-
eral guidance, the expected
allocation of the city will be
considerable.
"I think for the most partthe
federal transportation grant
funds are 80-20, so 80 per-
cent would be federal," Cooper
said. The remaining 20 percent
could also receive funding from
MDOT or other organizations,
he added. 4

'Arrow'hits a high mark

CBS FILMS
"So how much are they paying you to be in this movie?"
Clever confusing
'Psychopaths'

Superhero show

A compelling superhero origin
story has a lot in common with a
successful television pilot. The

powers came,
then launching The CW
their respective
franchises with the initial, bring-
the-team-together fight. Just like
in a pilot, character outlines and
plot elements have to be made
clear without dwelling too much
on background or exposition,
because, after all, we're there to
see some ass-kicking.
What makes the "Arrow"
so successful really doesn't
have much to do at all with the
eponymous Green Arrow's ori-
gin story, which the pilot leaves
deliberately vague. To sum up:
Wealthy playboy Oliver Queen
is stranded on an island and
presumed dead, then mysteri-
ously becomes a martial arts and
archery master and comes back
to wreak havoc on the corrupt
wealthy of his city. The absent
mythology is unmissed. The
episode had plenty of cheesy
expository lines and hammy

nonchalant, and Rave
beautiful dia-
logue. From a CBS Films
distance, it's
just two run-of-the-mill mob
hitmen shooting the shit as they
prepare to brutally execute their
boss's ex-girlfriend. But sitting in
the theater, it's a bracing display
of how effective writing can take
complete hold of how the most
overused, rundown movie tropes
can come to life on screen.
Those first five minutes, along
with a few more moments littered
throughout the movie, are some
of the most entertaining snippets
of film released this entire year.
The rest of the flick, for lack of a
better phease, sucks. It's boring,
scatterbrained and overwhelm-
@ ingly plagued by McDonagh's
feeble attempts at ridiculing the
predictability of modern Holly-
wood. Even though the assertion
is valid, it's psychopathic (get it?)
to try and demonize the notion of
predictability by making a film
so completely defined by its own
unpredictability.
Don't get me wrong - some
strangeness can go a long way. But
McDonagh isn't just satisfied by
making his plot weird. No, he has
to randomly stick in three more
bizarre stories that serve only
to disrupt the film's already off-
kilter pacing. Why do the stories
seemingly appear out of thin air?
Perhaps the-oldest excuse in the
book: The main character, Marty
(Colin Farrell, "Total Recall"), is a
Hollywood writer suffering from
alcoholism and a severe case of
writer's block.
Marty's current project is
a script called "Seven Psycho-
paths," about a group of uniquely
insane individuals on a quest. The
problem is, Marty doesn't know
who the psychopaths are, or what

the quest is. The onlythings set in
stone: The movie can't have too
much violence and can't end in
a massive shoot-out. It's a shitty
idea and Marty, knows it. So as
he struggles to string something
together before deadline, our
beleaguered protagonist hesitant-
ly accepts the help of Billy (Sam
Rockwell, "Moon") and Hans
(Christopher Walken, "Click"),
scam artists who make a living by
kidnapping dogs and then return-
ing them for the reward.
Maybe it
should have
oniy been four
psychopaths.
As it so happens, the duo's lat-
est victim is a shih-tzu owned by
the fiercest dog-loving mob boss
in town (Woody Harrelson, "The
Hunger Games"). Finally, just as
the fun starts and the dog hunt
begins, McDonagh's film col-
lapses in on itself and simply stops
being entertaining. The surpris-
ing part is that the performances
by the three leads never slip into
that same category.
All the cheesy impersonations
aside, the fact of the matter is that
Walken is the type of actor who
could stand in a corner reading
an encyclopedia and somehow
manage to make it entertaining.
So when "Seven Psychopaths"
starts to feel drawn out and irrel-
evant, the character the audience
really looks toward is Hans who,
through his wonderfully accented
quirks and mannerisms, is able to
keep them chuckling along.
But McDonagh has never
really had a problem coming up
with fascinating characters or the
necessary dialogue to keep them
interesting. The trouble is that
after looking past all the clumsily
executed side-stories and sub-
plots, no concrete narrative exists
to dictate the flow. And maybe
that lack of structure is exactly
what McDonagh was going for,
but for god's sake, Marty, why
does it have to be so damn boring?

Putting the hood in Robin Hood.
Amell, "Hung"); it is, after all,
a CW production. Despite that,
it moves at a brisk pace, and if
anything more had been added,
it probably wouldn't have sus-
tained the viewer's credulity or
attention.
It's clear that the Green Arrow
of the original comics is heav-
ily indebted to Batman, right
down to having an "Arrowcar"
and an "Arrowcave" - no, seri-
ously. Visually, it's all too easy to
compare "Arrow" to Christopher
Nolan's trilogy. It's a little unfair
that any superhero story with-
out too much sheen immediately
becomes categorized as a "Dark
Knight" clone, but that speaks to
the ubiquity of the Nolan movies
more than anything else.
To its credit, "Arrow" doesn't
really try too hard to be "The
Dark Knight." The glimpses of

Starling City, the New York clone
du jour, show a clear (but not too
onthe nose) contrastbetweenthe
lives of Queen and his plutocrat
friends and those of the strug-
gling poor. The action sequences
are appealingly acrobatic and
choreographed. Most impor-
tantly, there's not a whiff of the
self-important, intellectual pon-
derousness that critics of "The
Dark Knight" accused of drag-
ging down that franchise. While
the dialogue is at times stilted
and certain plot elements exas-
perating, the show is ultimately
enjoyable for its straightforward
approach.
Stephen Amell is a surpris-
ingly solid presence as the Green
Arrow. He had a hard time not
sounding lame with the afore-
mentioned voiceover, but Lau-
rence Olivier himself would have

struggled with lines that clunky.
To Amell's credit, he rises above
the requisite CW cheese, bring-
ing a certain asshole-ish dlan to
the millionaire playboy fagade
that serves as his cover and a
strong physicality to his scenes
as justice personified.
"Arrow" is a series that is well
aware of its limitations, and
never tries to overstep them.
The pilot demonstrated that
the show is well able to sustain
attention through a dynamic
hour, balancing generally well-
executed action, with sprinkles
of exposition, and the end of
the episode managed not to be
the most hackneyed possible
plot twist. For a CW superhe-
ro series, consistently staying
out of its own way is a serious
accomplishment, and "Arrow" is
on target. (Oh God).

FILM REVIEW
Captivating 'Argo'

FILM REVIEW
Flawed 'Sinister' chills

Affleck crafts a
tense, timely
masterpiece
By CARLY KEYES
For the Daily
When better to release a film
reeking of political animos-
ity than three weeks prior to the
U.S. presiden-
tial election? *
Or perhaps, an
eerie echo of Argo
a recent ter-
rorist attack At Quality16

"Argo" does
both, and two hooks are better
than one.
Though director, producer and
star Ben Affleck ("The Town")
couldnothaveforeseensuchaser-
endipitous temporal correlation,
"Argo," based on events during
the Iranian Hostage Crisis, hits
theaters just one month after four
Americans, including Ambas-
sador Christopher Stevens, fell
victim to a terrorist attack on the
U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya;
morbidity heightens as the event
occurred on Sept. 11. Apart from
bushy mustaches, bifocals, comb-
overs and classic cars, the Iranian
aggressors' on-screen seizure of
the U.S. embassy in Tehran on
Nov. 4, 1979 tendentiously salts
the wounds of this recent tragedy.
The opening sequence is
like a fire hose blast to the. face:
Affleck paints a haunting mural
of melee as Iranians leap over
fences, break down doors and
smash through windows, while
U.S. officials beg for reinforce-
ments from the powers that be.
When no military aid arrives,
three soldiers on-site attempt to
"peacefully" quell the onslaught

trying to "reason with" the mali-
cious mob. Negotiation proves

ineffective.
While 52 hostages are
detained, six diplomats evade
initial captivity and seek solace
with the Canadian Ambassador
(Victor Garber, "Kung Fu Panda
2"), but it's only a matter of time
before those responsible discover
they're a few prisoners short.
Racing against the clock, CIA
Agent Tony Mendez (Affleck)
devises a rescue mission: dis-
guise the Americans as a Cana-.
dian film crew on alocation scout
for their new Middle Eastern-
infused science fiction movie,
"Argo." Why would the CIA ever
support such a far-fetched course
of action? Well, all the ideas are
bad and "it's the best bad idea ...
by far."
Adapting Josh Bearman's arti-
cle, "How the CIA used a Fake
Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Ameri-
cans from Tehran" as his first
big-league feature, screenwriter
Chris Terrio meticulously speck-
les dire circumstances with emo-
tionally leveling gold nuggets
of humor. His characters are as
dynamic and refreshingly var-
iegated as the kooky plot itself,
brought to life by an incredible
ensemble cast that includes John
Goodman ("ParaNorman") as a

gregarious make-up artist, Alan
Arkin ("Little Miss Sunshine") as
a crass, washed-up director and
Bryan Cranston (TV's "Breaking
Bad"), with a full head of hair, as
Mendez's domestic go-to-man.
And, though there's no surprise
ending to this biopic, the suspense
is fiercely palpable, as the impor-
tant question isn't, "Will they
make it?" but, "How the hell ... ?"
Sure, "Argo" hits the cinemat-
ic bull's eye, but it's the subject
matter that packs the strongest
punch, as the fortuitous mod-
ern-day relevance fosters a
deeper emotional and intellec-
tual impact than the average
poignant historical recollection.
The film entertains and educates,
illuminating how history can,
and often does, repeat itself. And
in this case, that's not such a good
thing.
With a storyline hawking
currently controversial sub-
ject matter and a star-studded
cast, artfully directed and fed
clever dialogue, "Argo" yields
the power to wobble a malleable
voter mind; and, as the "Oscar
buzz" continues to grow, it might
prove as influential as the final
debate - or, based on that track
record, perhaps even more so.

they strive to

solid horrors are still few and

Omen," "The Exorcist" and "The
Shining" simply float in an esti-

does that mean these genres are
essentially dead? Meet "Sinister."
A film teeming with recycled ele-

deliver a smart, blood-curdling
script - synthesizing super-
natural whodunit-ness with an
ambitious dosage of disturbing
imagery.
Spook-fanatic director Scott
Derrickson ("The Exorcism

birthed his first mature project

previous film and "Paranormal
Activity," with a few added-value
components. This director doubt-

masses, and his missteps in "Sin-

downrightplot errors.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com I

Building women's soccer into Michigan's best team

eall have to start
somewhere.
Haley Kopmeyer
stepped underthe overhang of the
auxiliary brick building alongside
the Michigan field hockey'field.
She crossed her arms as the rain
dripped off her jacket. Her nerves
were as bad as
mine.

then a redshirt

goalkeeper,
was the lone
bright spot for STEPHEN J.

women's soc-
cer team.
Ryan Sosin, the team's sports
information director, had suggest-
ed the story - my first article at
the Daily - given that Kopmeyer
had collected two Big Ten Rookie
of the Week honors in as many.
weeks and had tied the program's
freshman record for shutouts.
Kopmeyer leaned against the
brick fagade of the buildingcthat
the women's soccer team used as
its locker room as the U-M Soccer
Complex was being built. There
were no soccer fields in sight. The
team's practice field was the out-
field of the baseball diamond at
Ray Fisher Stadium.
The questions were horribly
bland, and the answers weren't
much better.
I saved everything back then. I
saved my notepad, thoughI forgot
to actually write anything down. I
saved the audio recording. I saved
every version of the story the edi-
tors back at the Daily made that
night..
But I always wanted to try it
again.
On Tuesday, I got that chance.
Kopmeyer, a Troy, Mich. native,
laughed when I recounted the
story.
"Thanks for giving me another
try," I said.
"Absolutely," Kopmeyer
responded. "Four years later,
right?"
A few years sure changes a lot.
The story of the Michigan
women's soccer team can't be told
without explaining its foundation.
The foundation, meaningtthe pris-
tine pitch built as the centerpiece
of the U-M Soccer Complex.

Fifth-year senior goalkeeper Haley Kopmeyer has been with the Michigan women's soccer program through thick and thin as a four-year starter in Ann Arbor.

The transformation started
when Ryan, coming directly off a
three-year stint as head coach of
the U.S. Women's National Team,
sat down to interview for the head
coaching vacancy at Michigan.
He was told that an overhaul
was coming, and Michigan soccer
was'getting a new home farther
down State Street.
In February 2008, Ryan took
the job and the promise. He
quickly wrapped upa recruiting
class that included Kopmeyer and
current fifth-year senior Clare
Stachel. Then he went looking for
the next year's class.
But he had nothing to show off.
Since the building of Glick
Field House displaced the soc-
cer programs from their original
location and hiccups in the con-
struction process had delayed the
building of the U-M Soccer Com-
plex, the Wolverines had nowhere
to call home.
The new stadium down State
Street lay dormant.
"There was some issue with
permits and frogs," Kopmeyer
said.
Frogs?
"Some environmental issue."
Some home games were held
on Eastern Michigan's campus,
others were at Canton High
School.

"We played a night game under
the lights (in Canton) and I looked
up to see four telephone poles
with about six bulbs on each one,"
Ryan said. "You could hardly see
the ball."
And practices? He gave an
embarrassed laugh.
"Rich Maloney pitched in," le
said.
Maloney, then the Michigan
baseball coach, gave Ryan the
keys to Ray Fisher Stadium. The
Michigan women's soccer team

the outfield -

He finally day. Th

a class of eight denyi
freshmen. Only
one - redshirt
junior defender
Holly Hein - stuck around.
"Our first recruiting class was
basically Holly Hein because we
had almost zero money left to
recruit with that year," Ryan said.
The home games that season
were played on a muddy practice
field next door to the U-M Soccer
Complex construction zone.
It was a fabricated fttbol atmo-
sphere, but Michigan had nothing
better to offer.

Ryan hired a drummer to
take a seat on the sidelines by
the practice field at home games.
He'd drill a steady rhythm for two
hours, collect his pay and leave.
The drummer looked like a fanat-
ic, but he was just doing his job.
"We were just trying to do any-
thing to make it a bit more excit-
ing," Ryan said.
Michigan went 6-9-5.
Ryan was ready, the project's
completion was in sight. He blan-
keted the nation and even crossed
the border to
look for top-tier
recruits across
ght and North America.
His pitch was a,
ere's no promise.
"We recruit-
ng it." ed some of the
top players
from around
the country
and international players with
the promise that the stadium
was goingto be there when they
showed up in 2010," Ryan said.
But he never knew if the prom-
ise would hold.
"I used to go out every day and.
see if the grass had started to
sprout yet," Ryan said. "I'd notice
every brick they'd put down."
One by one, the commitments
started pouring in - Shelina

Zadorsky, Meghan Toohey, Tori
McCombs, Kayla Mannino, Nkem
Ezurike, Shelby Chambers-Garcia
- high school seniors buying into
a vision, a promise provided by a
former national team head coach.
"Thank God they did," Kop-
meyer said. "They started a snow-
ball effect ofbringing in really
talented classes."
When the freshmen stepped
onto the field that year, the grass
had finally sprouted. The last
bricks were laid. Ryan had kept
his promise.
Michigan went 10-5-4. Then
9-8-2 the next fall.
It's all changed. The only con-
stants for the Michigan women's
soccer team in the past four sea-
sons have been Ryan, Kopmeyer
and Stachel.
Michigan has a new home, a
new coach and a new team.
There's no drummer anymore.
On acold, blustery evening last
Wednesday, more than 1,000 fans
took in Michigan's 2-1 overtime
victory over Michigan State.
Denard Robinson was there, pos-
ing for photos with young Spartan
fans; Jordan Kovacs and Devin
Gardner also attended. Half of
the Michigan ice hockey and field

hockey teams were in the student
section.
"We went from 'home' stadi-
ums away from campus where
the only people there were our
parents to Wednesday night when
we played Michigan State and
the ... place is packed," Kopmeyer
said. "It's night and day. There's
no denying it."
The talent level isn't compa-
rable.
"Coming in, we just had a
complete program overhaul,"
Kopmeyer said. "The next couple
years we were trying to do things
but didn'tquite have the person-
nel.
"We've had some greatplayers
come through here - that's not to
discredit anybody - but collec-
tively we just didn't have what it
took to be a Big Ten contender."
This time, for the firsttime,
Michigan is exactly that: a Big
Ten contender at 13-2-1 overall,
7-0-i in the conference and riding
a program-best 10-game unbeaten
streak.
Kopmeyer, with the help of an
impenetrable back line, has back-
stopped the Wolverines to nine
shutouts this fall while break-
ing the Michigan all-time saves
record early in September.
"I think Haley is one of the
most improved goalkeepers I have
ever seen," Ryan said. "She was
a good goalkeeper coming out of
high school, but her progression
at Michigan has just been phe-
nomenal."
And the team? Well, it just
might be the best team you've
never seen. Ryan and the Wol-
verines boast a resume that bills
them as the best team on campus
this fall.
Michigan faces Big Ten jug-
gernaut Penn State on Sunday
in what likely will be a match of
top-20 teams vying for the Big
Ten crown.
That reminds me of my second-
ever story. It was a week after my
first one. Michigan was playing
the Nittany Lions in the season
finale on the muddy practice field
it called home down State Street.
Michigan never registered a
shot on goal. Penn State scored
twice and Kopmeyer made seven
saves.
This program has come a long
way since then. Butthey had to
start somewhere.

Michigan back line
shuts down Boilers

Michigan volleyball impresses
alumni in rout of Northwestern

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 21 Michigan women's
soccer team paired a smothering
defensive effort with a persistent
attack to overwhelm Purdue, 2-0,
on a windy Sunday afternoon at
the U-M Soccer Complex.
The Wolverines' defense,
which had L -UDU - --

teristically ----
surrendered goals in two of the
past three games, returned to its
dominant form against the Boil-
ermakers (2-5-1 Big Ten, 7-7-2
overall). The back four allowed
just two shots, and never let Pur-
due pressure senior goalkeeper
Haley Kopmeyer.
Junior defender Shelina
Zadorsky was pleased with her
unit, which stymied attacks,
controlled the pace of the match
and helped the Wolverines (7-0-
1, 13-2-1) transition quickly to
offense.
"We did our job today," she
said. "We learned from the errors
we made."
Offensively, Michigan routine-
ly found holes in the Boilermak-
ers' back line. The Wolverines
took six corner kicks, 24 shots -
10 on target - and found the back
of the net twice.
Michigan's attack broke the
scoreless tie in the 20th minute
courtesy of junior midfielder
Meghan Toohey. After junior for-
ward Nkem Ezurike got around
a defender and sent a low cross
through the 18-yard box, the ball
deflected out to an unmarked
Toohey. The midfielder one-
timed a shot past the diving Pur-
due goalkeeper for her third goal

of the season.
Despite a plethora of offensive
chances, the'1-0 score held until
senior midfielder Emily Jaffe
put the game out of reach in the
77th minute. After the Wolver-
ines earned a corner kick, Zador-
sky arched a cross to Jaffe. The
5-foot-6 midfielder elevated over
a Boilermakers' defender to fire a
screaming header just under the
crossbar.
A week ago, Jaffe had never
scored for the Wolverines. But
aftertallyingthe overtime winner
in Wednesday's victory against
Michigan State, Jaffe has quickly
become a key offensive presence.
Coming in as a late-game substi-
tute in both games, she has made
the most of her playing time, scor-
ing in consecutive games.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan has
taken notice, and plans on using
Jaffe more in the future.
"She's like our secret weapon,"
he said. "Probably not-so-secret
any more."
In the second half, the Wolver-
ines played with a strong wind at
their backs, which helped them
control possession and wear
down the Boilermakers. But
despite commanding the match,
Michigan struggled to capitalize
on their scoring opportunities.
Ryan wasn't too concerned with
those difficulties, though, choos-
ing instead to focus on the chanc-
es that the offense created.
"I was very pleased that our
kids were stepping up to the plate
and taking that many shots," he
said. "If you start thinking about
missing, it'll mess you up."
The Wolverines' win kept a
10-game unbeaten streak and
undefeated record at home intact.

The Michigan volleyball team
easily dispatched Northwestern
in a 3-0 rout at Cliff Keen Arena
in front of dozens of former
players and coaches Saturday
night. The Wolverines turned
in consis-
tent offen- - NWESTERN 0
sive and MICHIGAN 3
defensive
performances, led by juniors
Lexi Erwin, Ally Davis and
Jen Cross, freshman Tiffany
Morales and sophomore Lexi
Dannemiller.
Morales anchored the
defense with several impres-
sive digs, which were smooth-
ly turned into offense by
Dannemiller, who racked up
37 assists. Davis, Erwin and
Cross finished points with ease
all night, compiling 35 and a
half of Michigan's 54 points.
In particular, Erwin provided
key momentum shifting kills
and digs during crucial points
throughout the match.
"Lexi Erwin and Jen Cross
played great," said Michi-
gan coach Mark Rosen. "Lexi
Dannemiller ran the offense
really well. Ally Davis was
great, I thought across the
board everyone. played really
well."
The Wolverines, who have
struggled with consistency all
season, turned in one of their
best all-around performances.
"We played really clean," said
fifth-year senior Claire McEi-
heny "We've been struggling
with consistency. Something
was bound to come together.

Freshman outside hitter Ally Davis, pictured here, and the Wolverines cruised past Northwestern at Cliff Keen Arena.

We've had some things going
one night and other things not
going. But I feel like the last
few games everything has come
together, and we've started
playing like Michigan volley-
ball. It's a nice feeling."
The majority of the match
saw even play from both squads,
with Michigan proving them-
selves to be the better team by
producing in crunch time. All
three sets were close entering
the finalpoints, but the Wolver-
ines saved their best for last and
convincingly pulled away each
time.
In particular, Erwin and
Cross closed each set with
strings of kills that left North-

western on its heels and unable
to run its offense.
"We haven't been very good
at finishing games in the past,"
McElheny said. "But in practice
we've been working on closing
and not feeling the extra pres-
sure, which really helps, espe-
cially with a young tean."
Rosen added: "We're playing
really free right now. They're
not wrapped up in trying to
play perfect, they are just being
aggressive and going after it."
The Wolverines' stellar per-
formance impressed the alumni
who returned for a homecom-
ing ceremony after the second
set.
"The girls are really good,"

said Darlene Recker, who
played from 1993-97. "I feel like
every year the team gets better,
which is fantastic. It's nice to
finally sit and watch the game
without beingnervous about it."
The Wolverines kept the
nerve-wracking moments to a
minimum with their dominant
showing.
They will need to maintain a
high level of-play as they enter
what could be the most difficult
two-game stretch of their sea-
son. Michigan will host No. 25
Michigan State on Wednesday
before welcoming perennial
powerhouse and current No. 1
Penn State to Cliff Keen Arena
on Saturday.

Quinn slid a ball past redshirt
sophomore goalkeeper Adam
Grinwis in the 13th minute to
give Akron the one-goal advan-
tage.
"We were a little bit careless
in our possession," McMenemy
said. "It was always gonna be an
uphill battle. (We) need to learn
how to take care of the ball. We
made some adjustments after
the goal, and I think we made a
very good response."
The Wolverines managed
several chances from the wings,
but those opportunities ended
with headers that rolled wide
left and wide right. Just before
halftime, Michigan had its best
chance when a header from
junior forward Malcolm Miller
struck the crossbar.
A minute later, the referees
may have ended Michigan's
chance for an upset in Akron.
Senior defender Brian Klemc-
zak was shown a red card for a
hard challenge during the Zips'
quick transitional attack. The
half ended with Akron leading
1-0.
In the second half, Michigan
had even more to overcome with
just 10 men on the field. The
Wolverines came out with ener-
gy and a chip on their shoulder,
but Akron still proved to be too

much.
"They have an incredible
home support, (and) when you
go down a man you don't make
life easy for yourself," McMene-
my said. "We don't make excus-
es, and we don't believe in moral
victories. I don't think you'll
find many teams who played
Akron that well with IO men
though."
McMenemy was spot on
regarding his team's perfor-
mance in the final 45 minutes.
Michigan hit the woodwork yet
again, adding several scoring
chances from corner kicks as
the game progressed.

It was more than that.
More than any other team,
at least any other team in the
Big Ten, Michigan State has
stopped Michigan quarterback
Denard Robinson through the
air and on the ground. Robin-
son rushed for just 42 yards last
year. Two years ago, he gained
just 86 yards on the ground. In

the Illinois matchup, tweaking
what appeared to be his right-
hand pinky on an eight-yard rush
down to the Fighting Illini one-
yard line.
That drive was capped by an
18-yard field goal from redshirt
junior kicker Brendan Gibbons,
but all eyes were on the side-
line, where Robinson was being
attended to by a trio of trainers.
"It was just a boo-boo," Robin-
son joked after the game. "Every-
body gets hurt." .
The injury put the pressure
on the Michigan defense to pro-
tect a 10-point lead with untested
and unproven sophomore backup
quarterback Russell Bellomy tak-
ing the reins for Robinson.
"We want to win the game
on our side of the football," said
fifth-year senior middle line-
backer Kenny Demens. "Watch-
ing Denard go down like that,
we knew that we had to step our
game up. If they don't score any
more points, then we win the
ballgame."
And Illinois never did score a
single point. From the moment
Robinson stepped off the field on,
the Michigan defense allowed
just 97 yards and five first downs
in the remaining 51 minutes of
game time. Robinson missed
only one series, though, and got
right back to work. He handed off
three times, then finally ran, first
for three yards and then again
for 33 yards before stepping out
of bounds and inadvertently top-
pling an alumni cheerleader.
His shoe came off mid-run.
Shoelace was back, wet socks and
all. Three plays later, Robinson
finished with a six-yard scamper
into the end zone to put Michigan
up 17-0.
Illinois, too, ran into quar-
terback troubles when junior
quarterback Nathan Scheelhaase
was ridden down from behind
by junior cornerback Court-
ney Avery and junior defensive
end Jibreel Black. Scheelhaase
stayed on the turf for a few min-
utes before exiting the game
with an apparent head injury. He
was replaced by freshman quar-
terback Reilly O'Toole for the
remainder of the contest.
Michigan held a 17-0 lead at
halftime, but Robinson extended

forced four interceptions.
There was no trickery, no
smoke and mirrors in what
Borges called a "figurative fist
fight."' The Spartans were just
better and played harder.
That's not something you
change with a scheme, accord-
ing to Borges. -
"You go out there with an
attitude that you're going to
exceed their intensity and you
don't let people do that to you,"
Borges said.
"It's that simple. ... And if you
don't think that way, don't come
to this game."
For the players, the memories
that stick never come from dur-
that score early in the second half
with his 49-yard touchdown run.
Everyone in the Michigan
Stadium crowd - an announced
attendance of 110,922 - knew
Robinson would be on a short
leah in the second half and likely
wouldn't finish the game at quar-
terback considering Michigan's
sizeable and ever-expanding lead.
So he made the most of his last 15
minutes.
Robinson found freshman
tight end Devin Funchess for
an eight-yard touchdown pass
with 10:10 left in the third quar-
ter. Seven minutes later, two
plays after freshman defensive
end Mario Ojemudia recovered
a fumble on the Illinois six-yard
line, redshirt junior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint punched it
in for his first touchdown and put
Michigan up 38-0.
Bellomy returned to the field
for the fourth'quarter to end Rob-
inson's day. Robinson finished
7-for-11 passing for 159 yards and
a touchdown, and 11 carries for
128 rushing yards and two rush-
ing scores.
Sophomore running back
Thomas Rawls capped the scor-
ing with a 63-yard touchdown
run with 6:01 remaining in the
fourth quarter.
In the victory, Robinson
became the eighth player in Big
Ten history to surpass 10,000
yards of total offense, and he
posted his 18th 100-yard rush-
ing effort, putting him in a tie for
fourth place in Michigan history.
The statistics, though, mean
nothing to Michigan's senior
captain. Robinson said the only
statistic he pays attention to is
turnovers. And that's where this
game stood out.
On the other side of the field,
the Michigan defense stood
tall for the fourth-consecutive
game, after impressive showings
against Massachusetts, Notre
Dame and Purdue. In the second
half, Illinois gained just 13 total
yards.
The linebacker corps shone
especially bright. Senior middle
linebacker Kenny Demens inter-
cepted an O'Toole pass in the
third quarter, redshirt sopho-
more strongside linebacker
Jake Ryan wreaked havoc in the
Illinois backfield all afternoon
- registering two sacks and a
fumble forced - and sophomore
weakside linebacker Desmond
Morgan was honored with the

there were positives to be found.
The shorthanded Wolverines
shut out the Zips in the second
half. For 45 minutes, Michigan
may very well have outplayed
one of the nation's top programs
with 10 men.
"We were very threatening
in set pieces," McMenemy said.
"The way the boys followed
the game plan and the adjust-
ments, it's very heartening that
they can execute instructions
the way they did. You cant do
anything without an incredible
work ethic. and I think that's
what gives us the .most hope
going up against Indiana."
ing the game. Listen to Demens
or Gordon or Roundtree. The
pain always comes at the end.
Last year was an especially hol-
low feeling, knowing that the
Wolverines' four losses tied the
longest losing streak against the
Spartans in program history.
Indeed, for all the memories,
none can remember walking by
the Paul Bunyan Trophy in the
Schembechler Hall trophy case.
"I saw it on my official visit,

That would be something

Eli Day: A Detroit political junkie
with a global eye

By Adrienne Roberts

Name : Eli Day
Age : 20
Hometown : Detroit, Michigan
School and year : Public Policy Senior
What was it like to grow up in
Detroit?
It was always about trying to reconcile
two realities for me. I mean the neigh-
borhood I grew up in was aggressive,
butI had a stable home life. Both parents
were there but there was trouble. My
dad was like this old hippie, he was part
of the counter-culture, this old white
guy from Ohio. Him and my mom met
at this communist meeting in the '80s.
I'm just now recognizing how tough it
was for them raising a kid in inner city
Detroit. I think it's the greatest founda-
tion you could have. To get out of it, if
you can, there's no greater start.
So, I hear you have an actual "job"
now with Congressman Hansen
Clarke.
I started off as intern the summer after
freshman year. He was a state senator
from Detroit's east side. That first sum-
mer he was running for a congressional
seat. I was fortunate enough to be the
only campaign intern at the time. We
beat a 14-year incumbent. The follow-
ing summer they offered me a full time
job.
Wow, what exactly is your job title?
When we're out in public, he refers to
me as his policy consultant. But the titles
are inconsequential because you end up
doing casework, event coordination, a
lot of consulting with him in terms of

how to frame issues and if he's making a
speech, who to tailor it to. I'm on the clock
right now.
Do you want to continue working for
him after graduation?
The tragedy is we lost our re-election.
Without saying too much, it was hard. Not
just the loss but the nature of the election.
It was a bit disenchanting for me. As much
appreciation as I have for it, it's sort of
liberating to not have to deal with politics
anymore. So I'm looking to create a space
for myself outside it. Politics is just as
nasty as you think it is.
I heard you studied abroad in Cairo,
Egypt. How did you like it?
It's the best thing that's ever happened to
me. My roots are in international policy,
but I'm committed to working here. I think
there's plenty to do in Detroit, in my city,
but I'd love to do international work. I
mean spending time in probably the most
misunderstood region in the world with
welcoming and accommodating people
really made me want to transition into that
area.
On a lighter note, where do you like to
hang out in Ann Arbor?
I really bounce around a lot. Typically, you
can find me at some random friend's house,
I like a small group of people. I'm awkward'
with large crowds.
Who isn't? Any favorite restaurants?
Any good Egyptian food in Ann Arbor?
Egyptian food is miserable, so no.

Welcome to the Random Stu- have time or I would.
dent Interview. What's up with
the fountain by the Union?

I mean nothing, but ...
So, whose birthday are you
going to? Boy or girl?
Girl. Her name's Jill.


Hey! Got a minute?
Like literally a minute? Because
I'm late for my friend's birthday
party.

Where's the party?
It's not a party, we're just going
to dinner.
Where are you going?
Seva's or something. I don't
know how to pronounce it. It's
the vegetarian restaurant.

No, I think it's fine

OK. More like two or three.
I'm sorry I lied. Will you for-

OK. Let's hurry it up though.

Yes

OK. But first, let's talk about
boys.
Boys? What about them?
Oh, you know. Boys. What
boy comes to mind when I say
that?
One Direction.

specific, real-life boy drama,
contact, turmoil going on?
No. Actually, I live in an all-girl
floor and I was just thinking
about how I wish more boys
were around because they're fun.
Qh man, I stopped the wrong
person. All-girl floor? Lame.
Yeah.
Really? What's wrong with
girls?

Oh. That's not girly at all. Guys
can be vegetarians too. It's
good there. I had some vegan
pancakes. You can't really mess
with pancakes though. Are you
going to get pancakes?
Probably not.
OK. I'll let you go. I'm going to

All right. And let's move over
here because I don't know
what's up with that fountain.
It's been spraying water like 10

e are four friends, each no older than 12. We are on
VV/the street; tap shoes draped around our necks, black
dance bags at our sides. We wear baggy clothes and
scarf down the remnants from a bag of Cheetos. Streaks of
orange dust coat our hands. Ourfeetjitter in anticipation as we
wait outside the studio where we take classes every Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday.
I danced for five years, concluding the summer after sixth
grade.
After my sister Gabri died on a family bike trip in Wyo-
ming's Grand Teton National Park, my mother founded a
dance program to honor Gabri's love for dance. Though my
mother had no dance background, she wanted people to
remember my sister's passion.
One afternoon, as I was hanging around the dance studio,
watching a beginner's tap class, the teacher opened the door
and asked if I wanted to join. I said yes.
That first class is sealed in my memory: no tap shoes,
awkwardly kicking my bare feet against the ground, learn-
ing foreign words like shuffle, ball change, "over-the-top."
The thought of moving my feet in rhythmic patterns had
me hooked. I asked my parents to enroll me in the class that
same night.
For four days a week, my mom drove me across the city
from one dance class to the next. She would work in a make-
shift office converted from an old hotel basement until 9
p.m.; I would slip on my tap shoes and drum with metal on
the floor.
While most Yids I knew played sports, discussing their
favorite basketball or baseball players at lunch, I became
obsessed with different idols: people like Sammy Davis,
Jr., Sandman Sims, Gregory Hines and Arthur Duncan;
tap dancers I watched videos of them performing over and
over again ii my bedroom, trying and failing to mimic'theif

moves. I got a reputation in my class for imitating one famous
tap dancer or another. My nickname was Funkadelic.
My hobby made it difficult to build friendships with
other kids at school. I was essentially MIA after school and
on weekends. I was also afraid what they might say if they
found out. Would they think I was lame, girly, weird? I stayed
silent. If it ever did come up, I'd sidestep the topic. In my
mind, 12-year-old boys weren't supposed to dance.
So I'd wait for school to end, anxious to be with others
who shared my need to master a step or routine.
I had a home and a family. There was Andres, a slacker
who never practiced but surprised us all with his ability to
memorize and perfect routines on the first try. There was
Sandy, an improviser extraordinaire who specialized in
spinning on her toes; when the choreography bored her she'd
make up her own steps, which never failed to infuriate our
instructor, Steve, who regularly quizzed us on our knowl-
edge of tap greats such as Fred Astaire or Sammy Davis Jr.
Just to make sure we were, you know, doing our homework.
And soon, it wasn't just tap. Hesitant at first, I started bal-
let. Any misgivings I had about wearing tights were quickly
assuaged by my teacher, Vera. Her dedication to her students
made us all want to work harder, even if that meant staying
at the studio until 10 on a weeknight.
Her wardrobe choices were casual: a faded black t-shirt
with the word "Australia" sewn on, black dance pants and
old white ballet slippers worn down to reveal skin under-
neath. "I'm a freak," she would say, bottle of Evian water in
hand. "I should be arrested. Why do any of you hang around
with me? You should be at home." We would smile, not car-
ing our parents were waiting in the lobby to take us home
because class should have ended over an hour ago.
"I can't help it. I love what I do," she once told me. "And I
know how lucky I am to be doing what I love."
But it didn't last. I drifted away from dance. Maybe it was
the pressure of starting a new school, knowsing I wouldn't
have enough time to spend in the studio. Maybe it was my

parents worrying that their son's obsession was unrealis-
tic - I wasn't about to turn pro or earn a dance scholarship.
Or maybe I just lost interest, unwilling to devote the kind of
time and discipline necessary to actually be good.
Within weeks of stopping, my flexibility began to wane.
My muscles atrophied. I could no longer leap and extend the
way I once could. Over the next few months, I suppressed
any thoughts of returning to dance. I'd have to start all over,
regain my lost strength. My brother, who played water polo
in high school and college, once explained to me how he felt
after playing his last game.
"It's tough to know that I was in the best shape I'll ever be
in and that I'll never be in such good shape again," he said.
"I go to my buddies' games who are still on the team. But it's
hard. To know they're still in that shape, that they can still
move like that ... it's hard." I agreed.
Some years, I go with my parents to watch the dance pro-
gram's recitals in June. Watching the youngest kids I feel
nothing. No envy. No resentment. But to see my old friends
perform, who progressed without me, is a lesson in jealousy.
Despite being nine years removed, part of me still wants to
be on that stage.
When I tell people I danced briefly as akid they often reply
with, "Oh, so you're a dancer." I politely shake my head. Per-
haps one who used to play piano could get away with that.
I have friends who, though rusty, can still play a few scales
from their days of piano lessons. But once I stopped practic-
ing, improvising and stretching, I lost credibility.
Most people I danced with have also stopped by this point
for one reason or another. Except for Sandy. When I watched
her solo last June, she mesmerized the audience with her
skill and poise. With years of experience under her belt, she
could move like the old greats I'd once imitated. Toward
the end of her set, she broke into straight improvisation. It
looked familiar; she was still spinning on her toes.

You all pay tens of thousands of dollars to "study" this mindless non-
sense? No wonder the vast majority of you won't be able to find a full-time
job when you graduate.

This personal statement is brave and a profound reminder of why we
need to restore affirmative action, fight racism and build the leadership of
the new civil rights movement.

J ack Dorsey speaks with the kind of calmness you'd
expect from the creator of two of the most innovative
companies in the country. As an originator of Twit-
ter and the CEO and founder of Square, the mobile pay-
ments juggernaut that's turning established players like
MasterCard and Visa into dinosaurs, one has to remain
exceedingly levelheaded when pulled between the count-
less tasks that come with being a high-tech icon and bil-
lionaire.
"If you have an idea, get it out of your head," Dorsey says.
"Get it into code, get it into conversation, draw it out. That's
the best way to actually do something, (because) if you
don't get it out of your head, you're going to make excuses
for why it can't be done."
It isn't the ease with which Dorsey speaks that's surpris-
ing. It isn't the "Game of Thrones" theme song that plays
before his remarks - a perfect fit for the North Campus
computer science crowd. It's the forwardness and respect
he affords to students at least a decade younger and innu-
merably less successful than himself.
The biggest shock is that Dorsev is here at all on this

brisk September afternoon.
The 35-year-old fields questions about his disinterest in
in touch-to-share capability - dismissing it an intermediary
technology - and makes jokes about eBay's mismanagement
of Paypal.
Douglass Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional
Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that provides eco-
nomic information to congress, spoke on campus around
the same time as Dorsey. Both men are at the very top of
their respective spheres of influence. Dorsey is in the exclu-
sive club of modern technology giants, alongside the likes
of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.
Elmendorf is one of the country's most important policy-
shapers
But their visits to the University had one particular dif-
ference. Elmendorf was here to lecture on options for reduc-
ing the federal deficit. Dorsey was here asking 19-year-old
engineers to please, please come work for his company.
The pretty girls
"Should we put out all the swag?"
The question seemed more appropriate for a bat mitzvah
than a technical talk called "How To Build a Website." Yelp,
the user-generated review website that's become the de
facto answer to "Is this restaurant any good?" had a room
reserved in the Dow Building after running a booth at the.
Engineering Fall Career Fair on North Campus earlier that
afternoon.
"We're here to talk about some of Yelp's infrastructure
and how we scaled from a mom-and-pop website in 2004
to over 78-million monthly (unique users) today," explains
Ben Chess, an engineering manager at Yelp and a 2004 Uni-
versity alum.
Yelp chapstick, Yelp playing cards, Yelp bouncy balls are
spread out on a table - yep, put out all the swag (Or maybe
it's "schwag?"). A Facebook event for the tech talk promised
an iPad raffle, free food from Shalimar ("**Four Stars** on
yelp.com") and "sweet schwag."
Yelp is an aggressive player in the increasingly expensive
recruiting wars to find the next tech superstar.
"Having a second event today is a great way to have peo-

line of people, you only get a minute or so to talk to each
individual person. You can only communicate so much
information in that time."
The solution: Lure students back with a tech talk from
experts, four-star Indian food and fairly good odds at leav-
ing with an iPad. The scene almost makes one forget the
realreason-they're here.
"We do most of our hiring directly out of college," Chess
says. "That's always been our drive."
The job market for most college graduates is grim as 81
percent of recent graduates spent over six months looking
for work, and many of the jobs they eventually found didn't
require a degree, according to a 2011 study conducted by
Rutgers University's Bloustein School of Planning and Pub-
lic Policy.
But for those with computer science skills, the job mar-
ket is strong, flushed with cash and only getting better.
"The need for software is essentially infinite," said
Computer Science Prof. Elliot Solloway. "Software is the
gasoline, it's what makes the engine run and companies
know that there's simply not enough good software devel-
opers. No outsourcing to India or China is gonna solve the
software problem and everybody wants good software
people."
Software engineering, computer science skills, web and
mobile application production - a skill set referred to as
"hacking" - is increasingly a necessity for jobs in a wide
array of industries.
As a result, companies have to do more and more to
attract the best talent. And that means getting 19-year-old
students to come to your tech talk instead of Google's down
the hall.
One student put it well: "People are giving out crazy shit
to come interview."
"Engineers are the pretty girls in the room, and we want
all of them to come to our party," says Danielle van Asch
Prevot, a senior technical recruiter at Yelp.
Give the pretty girls an iPad, and hope they come work
for your company to build the next billion-dollar innova-
tion.
The astonishing part
The 48-Hour Mobile Apps Hackathon is taking place
later in the week, and Prof. Solloway - who specializes in
mobile technologies and their application in education - is
already excited about the weekend of programming he's
organized.
With the advent of the Apple, Android and Blackberry
app marketplaces, it's now become possible to write a com-
mercially viable piece of software - whether it's one that
helps you find a parking spot or check into all your social
media accounts - in 48 hours. Solloway offers a course
where students build an app over 10 weeks. At the Hack-
athon, teams compete in rapid app development - a 48-hour
pizza-and-caffeine-fueled marathon.
"People always say it's tough to get experience," says
Engineering senior Prashanth Sadajivan, who participated

be on-the-job experience, but it's building experience."
Sadajivan's hacking teammate Torehan Sharman, also an
Engineering senior, says the time constraint "forces" teams
to focus on simplicity and speed.
"The businesses and the people that are hiring are all real-
ly looking for this, like, (ability) to go from idea to a product,"
Sharman, a former Daily photographer, says.
The lights at the computer lab are dim as approximately
60 hackers - a handful of them women - drift in before the
6 p.m. kick off. "Here's plates; who needs plates?" Towers
of pizza boxes are quickly demolished as students settle in.
When enough people gather, Holloway asks students to
introduce themselves. He speaks with his hands when sit-
ting - in online videos, he often has a smartphone in one
to point at with the other - and enthusiastically gestures
with full arms while standing to address the room. Hackers
should first "slow-ly" say their names and address not what
business they're building, but "what problem are you going
to solve?"
This year, the-48-Hour Mobile Apps Hackathon is spon-
sored by Walmart, who has sent several representatives
for the weekend. Solloway explains the significance of the
recruiters making the trek to the University: "Walmart is
coming from Bettonville, Arkansas to Ann Arbor, Michigan
to sponsor a hackathon because they're hoping to be able to
hire some good software people." He almost sings the last
three words, the excitement for his students palpable.
"We want to make sure that we're getting the top talent
to build our business up to compete" with companies like
Google, says Ellen Sloneker, a senior recruiter for the super-
store.
Walmart wasn't always sponsoring sleepovers.
"In the past, Walmart did not go out recruiting. We actu-
ally had a few sets of schools we went to," said Paul Antony, a
vice president heading the company's store systems.
But Walmart is evolving with the times. Large companies
such as Walmart are in the process of playing with their mas-
sive amounts of data to better gauge customer shopping hab-
its.
"For someone who's really interested in statistics or big
data - a big buzzword - it's pretty appealing and it's pretty
cool," said Max Seiden, an Engineering senior.
This semester, Walmart is looking to fill S0 internship and
50 full-time onsitions from the University and other schools.

The recruiters will check in several times over the week-
end. The hackers are here to impress.
Back at the Hackathon, students split into project teams.
Freshmen nervously standing on the outer edges of the
computer lab are chided by Solloway to reach out and meet
new people. Mountain Dew and Domino's pizza are guzzled
down. A bag of baby carrots sits untouched.
The degree
"You can't really be a hacker without collaborating,"
Seiden says. "With the exception of, like, savants, who are
just insane - just like pillars of programming - for the most
part you really have to work with other people, bounce ideas
around."
He's sitting next to Engineering senior Guarav Kulkarni,
with whom he founded Michigan Hackers, a community of
software savvy students whose goal is to "solve problems
through the innovative use of technology," according to its
Facebook page. Seiden's page lists "Broke the Internet" on
his timeline of major 2012 events. Presumably, the Hackers
