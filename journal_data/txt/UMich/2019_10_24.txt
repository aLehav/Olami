In order to address the 
housing 
crisis 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 
stakeholders 
are 
proposing 
innovative 
solutions to address the 
issues 
of 
affordability 
and the growing influx of 
students while maintaining 

the city’s unique character. 
Rent control — legislation 
that sets caps on rents — 
is one such option the city 
council is considering. 
Rent 
control 
policy 
has 
been 
implemented 
statewide in California and 
in a few communities in 
Maryland and New Jersey 
to maintain the existing 
affordable 
housing 
and 
limit disruptions caused 

by dramatic rent increases. 
 
Under Michigan law, “A 
local 
governmental 
unit 
shall not enact, maintain, 
or enforce an ordinance or 
resolution that would have 
the effect of controlling the 
amount of rent charged for 
leasing private residential 
property.”
In an email interview, 
Jennifer Hall, executive 
director of the Ann Arbor 

Housing Commission, told 
The Daily rent control had 
previously been proposed 
in southeastern Michigan 
decades ago. 
“Rent 
control 
was 
proposed in Ann Arbor and 
Detroit in the 1980s and the 
state enacted legislation 
prohibiting it,” Hall wrote.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

About 100 people gathered 
in Weill Hall on Wednesday 
afternoon 
to 
hear 
Kathy 
Cramer, professor of political 
science at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison, tell 
stories from her research on 
the exclusion of rural voices 
in political discussions. The 
event, entitled “Listening to 
Strengthen Democracy,” was 
hosted by the Ford School 
of Public Policy as part of 
the school’s “Conversations 

Across Difference” lecture 
series. 
The Center for Local, State, 
and Urban Policy (CLOSUP), 
a research center at the Public 
Policy 
School, 
co-hosted 
the event because they are 
interested in redefining the 
ways society views urban and 
rural populations, according 
to Sarah Mills, senior project 
manager at CLOSUP.
“We’ve been really looking 
at what’s conceptualized as 
an urban-rural divide, but we 
like to think of it as an urban-
rural continuum,” Mills said.

CLOSUP and the Public 
Policy 
School 
invited 
Cramer 
to 
this 
lecture 
series because of her work 
in rural communities with 
the Local Voices Network, a 
digital network used to share 
community conversations. 
“Given her work trying to 
understand the rural side of 
the equation, we thought that 
sharing that with the U-M 
community would be helpful 
to understand what you can 
learn by listening to people 
in rural communities,” Mills 
said.

Cramer’s research involved 
working with experts at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and Cortico, a 
nonprofit focused on holding 
healthy political discussions 
in communities, to create the 
Local Voices Network.
“We are basically aiming 
for a way in which we can 
listen to one another and 
understand the perspectives 
of people who are unlike us or 
don’t live near (us) or who we 
haven’t had (an) interaction 
with,” Cramer said.

A 
petition 
demanding 
the University of Michigan 
release the papers of the late 
Dr. John Tanton, father of the 
anti-immigration movement, 
was presented to Tim Lynch, 
University 
vice 
president 
and 
general 
counsel, 
on 
Wednesday afternoon.
The petition, titled “Tell the 
University of Michigan: Stop 
Hiding White Nationalist’s 
Papers From The Public,” has 
more than 3,800 signatures. 
The petition was created by 
Law student Kerry Martin in 
an effort to raise awareness 
about Tanton’s ties to white 
nationalism, 
eugenics 
and 
anti-immigrant movements.

Martin 
originally 

requested 
to 
meet 
with 
University President Mark 
Schlissel 
regarding 
the 
petition, but was scheduled 
to meet with Lynch instead. 
Martin rehashed the events 
of 
the 
hour-long 
private 
meeting to The Daily, which 
included 
presenting 
the 
petition to Lynch and arguing 
why Tanton’s papers should 
be released immediately to 
the public.

Society for the Defense of Tradition, 
Family and Property takes Diag stand

The Tricontinental Solidarity 
Network held an open roundtable 
discussion on Wednesday evening 
at Hatcher to discuss the ongoing 
humanitarian crises in Kashmir 
and Hong Kong, where the lack of 
democratic freedom in each region 
has lead to protests against the 
Indian and Chinese governments, 
respectively. Around 30 University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
and 
community members attended the 
event led by five panelists, three of 
whom concealed their identities 
with face masks.
The event began with the 
panelists providing background 
and summary of the current 
situation in each region and then 
transitioned into a discussion 
about imperialism, the importance 
of grassroots movements and 
solidarity with oppressed people. 
Panelists 
drew 
connections 
between the surveillance tactics 
and mechanisms of control used 
by both the Chinese and Indian 
governments in Hong Kong and 
Kashmir, respectively, and how 
those practices mimicked patterns 
reproduced around the world 
where 
indigenous 
voices 
are 
overlooked.

More 
than 
a 
dozen 
male 
representatives 
from 
the 
American 
Society for the Defense 
of Tradition, Family and 
Property took to the Diag 
on Wednesday to oppose 
abortion rights, inciting 
responses from several 
bystanders. 
Members 
of 
TFP 
distributed 
anti-
abortion 
material 
to 
passersby. 
The 
pamphlets 
listed 
“10 
Reasons to Protect the 
Unborn,” claiming that 
“Abortion Offends God,” 
and calling the practice 
“Our Deadliest War.” 
John 
Ritchie, 
TFP’s 
student action director 
and one of the speakers 
at 
the 
Diag 
protest, 
told 
The 
Daily 
the 
organization stands up 
for conservative values 
by protesting abortion 
on 
college 
campuses 
around the country. 
“Today we are here 
promoting 
the 
right 
to life – every human 

being has a right to life, 
whether they are born 
or not,” Ritchie said. 
“... We are just visiting 
the state of Michigan 
going from campus to 
campus promoting and 
defending the right to 
life.”
According to Ritchie, 
the 
organization 
has 
about 200,000 members 
across the nation. 
In response to the anti-
abortion demonstrators, 
multiple 
students 
gathered in the Diag to 
protest the anti-abortion 
stance. 
LSA 
senior 
Tiahna Pantovich held a 
sign that read, “Get out 
of my womb.” She said 
she was determined to 
make an impression on 
TFP representatives.
“I’m 
going 
to 
keep 
screaming until you get 
annoyed with (my) voice,” 
Pantovich yelled at the 
TFP 
representatives. 
“Eventually, 
you’re 
going to get annoyed, 
and you’re going to say, 
‘I can’t stand listening 
to this woman,’ and then 
you’re going to dip out.”

Downtown Ann Arbor 
gained a new coffee shop 
when 
BeanBerry 
Cafe 
opened on October 15. 
BeanBerry 
is 
operated 
by 
two 
brothers, 
Wes 
and Issa Baiz, and offers 
a variety of coffees and 
teas, including bubble tea 
and bubble waffles. 
Their 
coffee 
option 
include a “Selfieccino,” a 
cappuccino with a photo 
printed 
directly 
into 
the foam on top of it. 
The image is made by a 
small printer operated by 
customers, who scan the 
QR code on the machine 
and upload the image they 

would like to have printed 
on their drinks. 
The 
machine 
only 
prints in coffee dust, so 
there are no colors. Wes 
Baiz explained they keep 
additives out of the drink. 
“You have the option 
of buying the machine 
and doing it with black 
and white or colored, but 
the colored has additives 
and all that, so we didn’t 
want to go that route,” 
Baiz said. “We just want 
the regular one and the 
regular one is just coffee 
extract.” 
The Baiz brothers grew 
up in Detroit, and also 
ran cafes in Toledo and 
Bowling 
Green, 
Ohio. 
Baiz 
said 
he 
wanted 

to introduce people to 
French press coffee, as 
well as coffee made from 
single-origin beans. 
“We want to give people 
a different idea of what 
your 
traditional 
coffee 
tastes like,” Baiz said. 
“People are typically used 
to things in the packet — 
like you put your cup into 
the machine and you’re 
done — and that’s why 
people don’t really like 
just regular coffee. So 
we want to really bring 
out the notes as much as 
we can, to give people a 
different experience than 
what they’ve had before.” 
 
As 
well 
as 
being 
focused on more natural 
coffee, they offer bubble 
tea without fructose 
by using pure sugar 
cane as a substitute 
if requested by the 
customer. 
The 
shop 
uses 
sustainable 
straws, 
even though it costs 
four times more to 
make bamboo straws 
instead 
of 
plastic. 
Baiz said it is worth it 
to follow BeanBerry’s 
mission 
of 
being 
environmentally 
conscious. 
All 
of 
the 
products 
they 
sell 
are 
compostable. 
Baiz said he and his 
brother established a 
route with a special 
company 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
garbage 
that 
they 
produce — including 
materials 
used 
by 
employees as well as 
trash from customers 
— is composted.
Baiz 
added 
the 
business 
isn’t 
all 

about profit. He said the 
company is very focused 
on the customers.
“For us, it’s not about 
profit 
margins,” 
Baiz 
said. “We have to have 
some, but we truly believe 
that if we deliver the 
best that we can, people 
will support us. We’re 
always going to stick to 
our values and our belief 
system because yes, we 
have 
the 
compostable 
products, 
but 
we 
also 
care about the people 
too.” 
Mark 
Marsinek, 
a 
resident 
of 
Oak 
Park, 
Mich., 
stopped 
into 
BeanBerry on a business 
trip to Ann Arbor. He 
said he loved the colorful 
signature bubble waff le.
 “I think it’s extremely 
innovative, and I think 
that 
it’s 
going 
to 
be 
a big hit because it’s 
something 
different,” 
Marsinek said. “People 
can come in here and not 
just get coffee, but they 
can get bubble tea or a 
waff le with ice cream, 
and this is really, really 
good. 
The 
concept 
is 
pretty incredible.” 
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Kendall Kaiser said as a 
coffee fanatic, she thinks 
BeanBerry will thrive in 
Ann Arbor. 
“I’m 
really 
excited 
about it,” Kaiser said. 
“I studied abroad this 
past semester, and I was 
visiting Copenhagen, and 
I went to a coffee shop 
with my friends, and they 
had that same concept, so 
it’s really cool to see in 
America.”

Music, dabke and calls 
for 
revolution 
filled 
the Diag Wednesday as 
dozens of students and 
community 
members 
gathered in solidarity with 
protests against chronic 
corruption in the Lebanese 
government. 
Thursday 
marks the eighth day of 
protests where millions of 
Lebanese people from all 
sects and regions of the 
country shut down streets 
and businesses to voice 
their 
demands 
for 
fair 
governance.
The 
protests 
were 
spurred 
by 
a 
tax 
on 
WhatsApp, the country’s 
most popular messaging 
app. 
LSA 
senior 
Silan 
Fadlallah, who is Lebanese, 
emphasized the WhatsApp 
tax is merely the tip of the 
iceberg.
“I know a lot of people 
make jokes, ‘Oh, it’s the 
WhatsApp tax that tipped 
everything 
over,’ 
which 
is funny,” Fadlallah said. 
“Being Lebanese myself, 

I laughed at that. But I 
think people need to be 
very conscious of the way 
that media portrays the 
protests. And they need 
to 
understand 
that 
no, 
it’s not WhatsApp that 
was, ‘Oh, now I’m going 
to get mad.’ It’s been a 
long time coming, and it’s 
been a compilation of a lot 
of injustices, and a lot of 
things that people deserve 
basic human rights, like 
medical care, for example, 
that 
they 
haven’t 
been 
granted.”
LSA senior Maya Zreik, 
who is Lebanese and the 
Middle 
East 
regional 
editor for the Michigan 
Journal of International 
Affairs, agrees, and said 
the protests are a result of 
high unemployment and 
the government’s inability 
to meet basic needs. 
“I think these protests 
show that people are at 
their breaking point right 
now, because corruption 
in 
Lebanon 
has 
gotten 
worse as the years have 
gone by,” Zreik said. “... 
I know people don’t have 
food, 
don’t 
have 
clean 

drinking water, don’t have 
electricity. So I think these 
protests are a culmination 
of all of these struggles 
coming 
together 
right 
now.”
Lebanon’s protests have 
typically 
been 
divided 
across religious and ethnic 
lines, but this time the 
protests have been non-
sectarian.
“The 
protests 
are 
really beautiful to watch 
because people of different 
religions, 
ethnic 
groups 
are 
uniting 
to 
demand 
accountability 
from 
the 
government and an end to 
corruption, and renewal 
of 
government 
services 
that 
are 
necessary 
for 
basic survival,” Zreik said. 
“Hopefully this becomes a 
true revolution.”
Engineering 
junior 
Bashar Hallak said uniting 
sectarian groups is success 
in itself.
“Even if none of what we 
ask for happens, we made a 
big improvement,” Hallak 
said. “This is a very good 
success 
that 
we 
made, 
is that we’ve all come 
together, and we’ve proved 

to the world that Lebanese 
people are united.”
Fadlallah 
said 
while 
some 
don’t 
see 
the 
importance 
of 
protests, 
she believes they can help 
raise awareness about the 
situation.
“A lot of people don’t 
see the point in protests,” 
Fadlallah said. “I think that 
in this case specifically, 
seeing protests that are 
happening 
worldwide 
from a bunch of Lebanese 
people in the most random 
countries is amazing, and 
I think we have a duty, in 
a sense, to put ourselves 
out there. Not even for the 
Lebanese government to be 
like, ‘Oh, they’re protesting 
in Dearborn, we need to 
change something,’ but for 
us to raise awareness with 
our own communities to 
realize this is something 
that’s affecting a lot of 
your friends, or a lot of 
people in your community, 
and 
it’s 
something 
you 
should be made aware of.”

“I don’t know if it is currently 
on anyone’s radar to further 
change the state act.”
Advocates 
of 
rent 
control 
argue it can limit the effects of 
gentrification. A recent analysis 
by the Chicago Policy Review 
on the effects of rent control 
policy on San Francisco found 
that it allowed older, established 
residents 
to 
stay 
in 
their 
apartments 
longer. 
However, 
the analysis also determined 
the 
policy 
could 
increase 
gentrification by incentivizing 
landlords to push tenants out and 
increase turnover, which was the 
only time landlords could raise 
rent prices. 
The estimated average savings 

for tenants who had rent control 
were between $2,300 and $6,600 
per year from 1995 to 2012. 
During this time, however, rents 
in San Francisco rose 5.1 percent, 
meaning newer, younger tenants 
shouldered the costs of higher 
rents.
In September, Peter Allen, 
lecturer at the Taubman College 
of Architecture, Urban Planning 
and the Ross School of Business, 
proposed 
several 
student-
led development solutions to 
the housing crisis. From his 
perspective, 
rent 
control 
is 
only a limit on the new supply 
of housing because it does not 
foster private sector investment, 
he said. 
He pointed to tech companies’ 
recent pledge in California to 
invest money and ease the inflated 
housing prices. Allen described 

Ann Arbor as a “little version” 
of Silicon Valley, as it shares 
characteristics like robust job 
growth but insufficient addition 
of housing. Allen emphasized 
the need for multi-stakeholder 
solutions in Ann Arbor. 
“We 
must 
connect 
affordability together with the 
other 
difficult 
public 
policy 
issues of climate action, mobility 
and sense of neighborhood,” 
Allen said. “We must motivate all 
public landowners to redevelop 
all surface parking lots or excess 
public land in and around Ann 
Arbor into mixed use, transit 
oriented, 
dense 
retail 
and 
housing developments that offer 
rents for the entire job market, 
starting from $500 per month 
for a one bedroom. The city’s 
analysis of all its excess public 
land like the former Y site next 

to the Blake Transit Center is a 
grand start.”
LSA junior Maya Chamra 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of her perspective as a student 
advocate for general affordability 
in Ann Arbor. She said she 
believes rent control could be 
a good option to address the 
affordability crisis.
“I think that the way the Ann 
Arbor market is, is that students 
are always going to be in need of 
housing,” Chamra said. “Housing 
is always going to be in demand. 
At this point I can only see the 
cost of renting for students to 
only go up, and there needs to 
be a way for both the University 
and the city to get involved such 
that students don’t have to face 
another affordability issue while 
they’re trying to go to college, 
which is already so expensive.”

Speaking 
to 
The 
Daily, 
Pantovich 
articulated 
her 
frustration at the lack of women 
present from the organization 
and 
explained 
she 
was 
disappointed with the group’s 
view on abortion. 
“These are all men, they 
are not taking the opinions 
of women or their input,” 
Pantovich 
said. 
“You 
can 
come and say ‘I disagree with 
abortion,’ but when you say it’s 
a sin, and I’m a bad person for 
doing what’s best for my life, 
that doesn’t make sense and 
that’s not allowed. I am going 
to let them know that I am not 
okay with that. The best thing 
about this campus is the fact 
that it’s a public campus and I 
can scream as long as I want to. 
It’s my freedom of speech.” 
Ritchie told The Daily while 
there are women members of 
TFP, the majority are male. 
“A lot of out membership is 
women, but our core group is a 
men’s group,” Ritchie said. 
The 
protest 
garnered 

attention from students walking 
by, several of whom stopped to 
engage in conversation with 
members of TFP. LSA senior 
Ben Freund told The Daily he 
was disappointed by what he 
saw as the unwillingness of the 
TFP representatives to engage 
in discussion. 
“My friend and I talked with 
a couple of people around the 
Diag and they say they are 
here for a dialogue,” Freund 
said. “It’s clear that a dialogue 
assumes two people are willing 
to not only say their piece but 
also listen to what other people 
have to say. They’re not here to 
listen to what other people have 
to say.”
Freund said he saw the 
group’s moral argument as 
biased given the fact that there 
were no female representatives 
from TFP present. 
“We were talking about moral 
high ground… and how they 
selectively apply a moral 
high ground to problems 
that don’t even affect them 
– you see it’s all men on this 
Diag,” Freund said. “For 
them to have a moral high-
ground opinion on this issue 
doesn’t seem right to me.”

Cramer became interested 
in rural and urban dialogues 
as a graduate student at the 
University of Michigan. While 
doing research in the South, 
she came across interesting 
conversations among locals in 
public spaces like post offices.
“From pretty early on in my 
career as a political scientist, 
I knew I was interested in 
conversations, and I knew that 
I thought about (rural peoples’) 
lives and about the way they 
understand 
politics 
from 
listening to them talk with one 
another,” Cramer said.
In her research, she and 
her 
coworkers 
facilitate 
conversations about a variety of 
topics between six community 
volunteers, which are recorded 
using a digital hearth, an audio 
recording technology that has 
the capacity to play audio from 

other conversations. Cramer 
aims to place digital hearths 
in libraries across the country 
so more conversations can be 
recorded and shared.
“We’re trying to lift up the 
voices of people who aren’t 
normally heard, we’re trying 
to get people to listen and learn 
across 
boundaries,” 
Cramer 
said.
Cramer’s work culminated 
in a collection of conversations 
from 
communities 
in 
Massachusetts, 
New 
York, 
Alabama and Wisconsin that 
are available on the network’s 
website for online listening. 
“The 
conversations 
are 
shared across a community, 
across 
neighborhoods 
in 
a 
community 
and 
across 
geographic space,” Cramer said.
Mills explained the urban-
rural 
divide 
exists 
at 
the 
University of Michigan.
“We are a university that is 
in an urban environment, a lot 
of people here are urban, but 

we are a public university that 
represents the whole state, and 
so I think it’s really important 
that we recognize what those 
rural voices care about,” Mills 
said.
Mills said people tend to take 
an 
argumentative 
approach 
to 
dialogues, 
focusing 
on 
difference rather than common 
ground.
“A lot of the concerns that we 
see in rural communities are 
similar to what we see in urban 
communities,” 
Mills 
said. 
“We don’t often look for those 
commonalities and we often 
talk past each other, or feel, 
on one side of the equation or 
the other, that we aren’t being 
heard.”
Cramer said focusing on 
conflict can prevent groups 
from making progress towards 
correcting the issues they care 
about.
“We throw up our hands, 
we turn away, we don’t engage, 
we don’t get involved, and the 

result is that the policies that 
are getting us to these places, 
whether we’re talking about 
economic policy or otherwise, 
continue,” Cramer said.
The main takeaways from 
Cramer’s 
work 
related 
to 
creating productive dialogues. 
She emphasized the importance 
of listening to all discussions.
“I think the key thing I would 
say is just giving yourself the 
luxury to listen as opposed to 
debate,” Cramer said. “All too 
often we assume that our role is 
to defend our point of view and 
persuade other people, but most 
of the time it doesn’t work, and 
there’s so much of a need right 
now to do the opposite.”
In an interview with The 
Daily after the event, LSA 
freshman 
Nina 
Rosenberg 
emphasized the importance 
of 
listening 
to 
different 
viewpoints.

“This is an issue of University 
transparency,” 
Martin 
said. 
“This is a public university 
trying to keep secret papers 
of the architect of the anti-
immigrant 
movement, 
a 
known white nationalist. I told 
(Lynch) that keeping it secret 
is depriving immigrant rights 
activists and civil rights activists 
of an opportunity to draw 
more clearly the line between 
the University’s current anti-
administration policies and the 
racist xenophobic rhetoric that 
would be found in those papers.”
The petition was written 
earlier this year and calls on 
the University to limit “the 
spread of white supremacist 
ideology across the country 
and prevent further erosion of 
our democracy.” Martin and 
petition supporters argue that 
the University is using taxpayer 
dollars and University resources 
to keep Tanton’s papers secret 
from the public. After a legal 
battle spanning almost three 
years, the University is bringing 
the 
case 
to 
the 
Michigan 
Supreme Court. 
Law 
student 
Angela 
Theodoropoulos also attended 
Wednesday’s 
meeting. 
She 
recalled Lynch could not discuss 
specific legal matters related to 
the case, but made it clear his 
positions were being stated on 
behalf of his client, which is the 
University.
“It 
seemed 
that 
(Lynch) 
was trying to convey that he 
has a duty of zealous advocacy 
on behalf of his client, the 
University, and the library,” 
Theodoropoulos said. “And so, 
even if his beliefs are different, 
or the University’s beliefs are 
different, 
(there) 
might 
be 
reasons in terms of wanting 
to 
acquire 
excellent 
papers 
that could be used later that 
could fuel one’s hypothetical 
position.”
Martin said that during the 
meeting, 
Lynch 
questioned 
both him and Theodoropoulos 
on 
their 
own 
ideological 
perspectives in regards to the 

case and gave hypotheticals as 
a way to attempt to challenge 
their view on the case. The 
sealed Tanton papers and the 
records of a beloved civil rights 
activist or a liberal Supreme 
Court justice, Martin said, are 
not comparable. 
“The 
same 
reasons 
for 
releasing the Tanton papers 
shouldn’t 
apply 
in 
those 
circumstances, partly based on 
the law and the shadiness with 
which the University has gone 
about defending the secrecy of 
these papers, but also partly 
based on a belief that we have 
that the law really does take 
into account public interest,” 
Martin said. “There’s public 
interest at question (and) at 
stake when you’re concealing 
papers belonging to a racist 
white nationalist whose biased 
xenophobic views are currently 
fueling horrific policies out of 
Washington. The stakes are 
different, 
the 
interests 
are 
different, and that matters.”
Theodoropoulos 
echoed 
Martin’s 
sentiment 
and 
explained 
she 
hopes 
the 
University 
will 
be 
more 
transparent with its stances on 
similar issues in the future.
“The University can’t really 
speak out of both sides of its 
mouth very fairly, and I think 
that that’s something that I 
think both Kerry and I want 
to see the University sort of 
reconcile their position on that, 
and be held more accountable 
in terms of being transparent,” 
Theodoropoulos 
said. 
“Of 
course, there’s a bit of a tension 
there, because we obviously 
have different interests at stake.”
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen confirmed the 
subject of the meeting with The 
Daily, in an email interview, and 
also emphasized while this case 
is pending trial, the University 
cannot comment on the petition 
or action steps following the 
Wednesday meeting.
“As you know, this is a legal 
matter and will be handled 
in the courts,” Broekhuizen 
wrote.“...(P)ending trial or other 
legal developments the closed 
portions of this collection will 
remain closed.”

The 
lack 
of 
autonomy 
and 
self-determination 
in 
Kashmir concerned panelist 
Safwaan 
Mir, 
a 
Business 
graduate student, who said 
she hopes the issue is not 
seen as a territorial dispute 
between the two countries of 
India and Pakistan, but rather 
as a war against the Kashmiri 
people, who are not involved 
in the decision-making.
“Someone small is being 
trampled by those who are 
much more powerful and it 
takes common people caring 
in order to have any sort 
of impact on the Kashmir 
situation,” Mir said.
Panelists focused on the 
treatment of the crises by 
the governments of India 
and Pakistan in terms of 
surveillance 
and 
military 

control, 
the 
countries’ 
economic 
motivations 
and 
how each region is considered 
a pawn in a political game.
Rackham student Joshua 
Kam said the two countries 
indicate signs of imperialism.
“I think I attended the 
event to see how solidarity 
can 
be 
built 
between 
disparate regions,” Kam said. 
“I care about the fate of Hong 
Kong and its liberty. I despise 
imperialism and just want it 
to not be around anywhere.”
Rackham student Amanda 
Kaminsky 
related 
the 
current geopolitical themes 
with historical themes of 
colonialism.
“I thought it was interesting 
to see the linkages drawn 
between different colonial 
and post-colonial empires 
in terms of surveillance and 
state violence,” Kaminsky 
said.

Shifting exercise focus away from body image
I

t’s early October, which 
means that my summer of 
waiting for professional 
basketball to start again is 
over, and the NBA’s activities 
for the new season have begun. 
In the flurry of team media 
days and preseason games, I 
came across a Deadspin piece 
that features five pictures of 
Denver Nuggets star center 
Nikola Jokic from a team 
photo shoot. Some of the 
captions in the piece, as well 
as many of the comments, 
drew attention to Jokic’s body.
Jokic, despite standing at 
7 feet tall, does not resemble 
many 
NBA 
players 
in 
physique – namely, he seems 
to have more body fat and less 
muscular definition than his 
peers. His weight has caused 
some to doubt his fitness 
and 
on-court 
production 
capabilities. Jokic, however, 
is one of the best basketball 
players in the league. In the 
2018-19 season, he ranked 
third in the NBA in the 
advanced metric of Value 
Over Replacement Player and 
finished fourth in a vote for 
the league’s Most Valuable 
Player. In a testament to his 
fitness, Jokic also logged 65 
highly-productive minutes in 
a quadruple-overtime playoff 
game in May, the most played 
in a single game by any NBA 
player since 1984. 
Most of us will never play 
professional basketball, but 
many of us find other ways to 
get exercise. There is often a 
body image aspect to physical 
activity – that is, the way 
we believe others view our 
physique, which is commonly 
formed from the way we view 
how others look. Many strive 
to achieve what is considered 
the 
ideal 
body 
type 
for 
their gender and exercise 
accordingly. 
However, 
as 
Jokic demonstrates, one does 
not have to look conventional 
to be in excellent shape. In 
order to benefit in the long 
run, we should focus on 
exercising for functionality, 
longevity and fun. 
Concepts 
of 
favorable 
bodies are often perpetuated 
by inescapable media-driven 
ideals, which influence social 
standards and make shifting 
one’s focus away from ideal 
physiques 
challenging. 
The checkout line at every 
other store is decked with 
magazines with slim women 
on 
the 
covers 
and 
bold 
headlines that promise flatter 
abs and accentuated curves 
in a matter of days or weeks, 
insinuating that these are the 
results that women should 
want to achieve. Ideals are 
also clearly defined for men 
– Zac Efron in “Baywatch” 
illustrates an exaggeration of 
a “desirable” male physique: 
ripped 
musculature 
with 
impossibly low body fat. Given 
the ubiquity of these images 
in 
American 
culture, 
we 

often mentally impose these 
ideals on others and believe 
others expect them from us. 
Breaking from this mindset is 
understandably difficult.
The way male and female 
physiques have changed and 
vary around the world shows 
that these ideals are socially-
constructed 
rather 
than 
innate. The perceived optimal 
body type in America, in 
theory, displays good health 
bred from a wholesome diet 
and plenty of exercise. The 
issue 
with 
chasing 
these 
prototypes in real life is that 
people often achieve them in 
a way that is often unhealthy 
and unsustainable. Diet and 
exercise regimens that offer 
timelines of weeks instead of 
months or years may provide 
rapid results, but they lead 
to relapse and do not foster 
long-term habits that promote 
good health. To garner truly 
excellent 
health, 
fitness 
routines should be centered 
around improving the body’s 
functionality and longevity, 
and visible results that are 
sustainable 
will 
inevitably 
come.

A focus on body image also 
has the potential to harm 
the self-esteem of those who 
exercise. A 2005 study of 
college students showed that a 
large number of both men and 
women who exercise place 
emphasis on body image, and 
that this focus is associated 
with 
reduced 
self-esteem, 
particularly 
in 
younger 
and 
female-identifying 
participants in the study. One 
consequence of this emphasis 
on body image is that many 
people who exercise focus 
on performing activities that 
focus on physique rather than 
those who contribute to better 
overall health.
There 
is, 
however, 
significant 
importance 
in 
exercising 
for 
functional 
benefits, such as increased 
strength, 
flexibility 
and 
stamina. 
The 
long-term 
benefits may be even more 
essential. As young adults, 
we 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
establish not only habits but 
also 
physiological 
changes 
that can benefit us in the 
future. A 2014 study on 
adult men showed that men 
who 
regularly 
participate 
in 
high-impact 
exercise 
in adolescence and young 
adulthood 
had 
increased 
bone density when compared 

to those who did not, even 
when neither of these groups 
participated 
in 
significant 
exercise in later adulthood. 
 
Establishing significant bone 
density in early adulthood 
helps 
prevent 
structural 
issues in later adulthood, 
especially the negative effects 
of osteoporosis. Additionally, 
maintenance of a healthy 
body mass index throughout 
life reduces the likelihood of 
developing 
cardiovascular 
disease.
We can motivate ourselves 
to exercise for these purposes 
by 
keeping 
activities 
enjoyable and setting goals. 
Those who participate in 
exercises they enjoy tend to 
have more positive feelings 
following 
these 
activities 
and are more likely to repeat 
them in the near future. As 
such, we should seek physical 
activities that make us happy. 
These activities don’t have 
to be restricted to using gym 
equipment: 
Team 
sports, 
hiking and dancing are all 
excellent ways of establishing 
and 
maintaining 
overall 
fitness. 
Conversely, 
when 
one’s primary motivator is 
body image, lack of progress 
toward an ideal may lead to 
the development of negative 
self-concept and discourage 
continued activity. 
Setting 
goals 
for 
improvements in fitness and 
body 
composition 
can 
be 
great motivators for exercise, 
but it is best to focus on 
making progress and setting 
realistic 
expectations. 
If 
our aim is to lose weight, we 
should celebrate incremental 
successes in reaching our 
goals. It is common to see 
plateaus in progress in any 
exercise plan, so it is essential 
to 
remember 
that 
fitness 
improvements are made even 
during plateaus and that we 
are still benefiting our bodies 
in the short and long term.
The important thing is to 
maintain 
happiness. 
Self-
worth and fitness go far 
beyond one’s physique. By 
being 
comfortable 
in 
our 
own bodies, we can focus on 
exercising for health benefits, 
keeping activities enjoyable 
and not getting bogged down 
by minute issues. This can be 
challenging when businesses 
seem to do all they can to 
push certain ideals to drive 
consumer 
behaviors 
that 
reinforce these ideals. If we 
can continue to remember 
that, ultimately, the shapes 
of others’ bodies should not 
matter to us, then we can 
convince ourselves that what 
we look like should not matter 
to the people who care about 
us most. Once we do this, we 
can accept that appearance 
is not the same as fitness and 
strive to focus on the latter.

The looming threat of unrepresentative democracy
T

he 
Constitution 
was 
ratified 231 years ago, 
making 
the 
United 
States 
one 
of 
the 
oldest 
modern democracies in the 
world. Along the way, we 
have 
tweaked 
and 
refined 
our 
system 
by 
expanding 
voting rights, delegating more 
responsibility to the electorate 
and 
eliminating 
unforeseen 
quirks. The gradual evolution 
of our institutions has enabled 
our 
democracy 
to 
endure 
and 
thrive 
for 
centuries, 
with 
our 
constitutional 
safeguards 
affording 
an 
enviable degree of stability. 
But today, our core tenet of 
fair democratic representation 
is quietly eroding, and further 
institutional 
adaptation 
is 
necessary 
to 
preserve 
the 
vitality of American democracy.
The Electoral College is the 
most obvious area for reform, 
and the prospect of such reform 
has been widely debated since 
former 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Hillary Clinton was defeated in 
the 2016 presidential election 
despite winning the popular 
vote by nearly three million 
votes. The popular vote winner 
has lost the Electoral College 
five times, but two of these 
were atypical circumstances: 
the four-way election of 1824, 
which was decided by Congress, 
and the corrupt election of 1876. 
The Electoral College had never 
awarded victory to the popular 
vote loser in a clean, two-way 
race – until recently. Now, two 
of the past five elections have 
been won by the popular vote 
loser, and statisticians predict 
the trend could continue in 
future elections. 
This trend is alarming, but 
after 2016, many on the right 
have rushed to the defense of the 
current system. Conservative 
commentators have peddled 
myths 
that 
the 
Electoral 
College 
was 
deliberately 
created as a anti-majoritarian 
institution, 
purposefully 
designed to ensure small-state 
voters a voice in the presidential 
elections.
This historical retelling is 
novel, but grossly inaccurate. 
The 
Electoral 
College 
was 
created 
as 
a 
compromise 
between the direct election 
of the president and letting 
Congress choose the president. 

The 
founders 
were 
wary 
of the populace’s ability to 
rationally choose a president 
and designed the Electoral 
College as a mechanism to 
keep the presidency a safe 
distance from the passions and 
whims of the general public – 
Alexander Hamilton explained 
the 
rationale 
in 
Federalist 
68. The general public would 
choose 
electors, 
and 
these 
electors 
would 
choose 
the 
president. The Founders failed 
to foresee that electors would 
preemptively pledge to vote 
for a certain candidate, and 
as a result, we are left with an 
oddly indirect way of electing 
presidents. 
Historical 
inaccuracies 
aside, the Electoral College is 
not needed to give small states 
a voice. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
Electoral 
College 
currently 
dilutes the voices of voters 
who live in larger states and 
essentially ignores the voices of 
voters in uncompetitive states. 
The reality is that the Electoral 
College is a relic from an era 
when presidents were intended 
to be selected, rather than 
elected, and its continued usage 
defies the ideal of one person, 
one vote. If the nation’s leader 
is to represent the will of the 
nation, a transition to a popular 
vote is imperative.
Moreover, faithless electors 
pose a oft-overlooked threat 
to the integrity of presidential 
elections. Due to the Electoral 
College, 
Election 
Day 
technically 
only 
determines 
electors, and the election is not 
officially determined until the 
electors vote. In 2016, several 
of these electors went rogue 
and refused to vote for the 
candidate they had promised 
to vote for. A federal court 
ruled these “faithless electors” 
cannot be prevented from going 
rogue or punished for breaking 
a pledge, meaning in a close 
election, the will of the nation 
can be overturned by a handful 
of unscrupulous electors.
Beyond 
the 
Electoral 
College, 
a 
lesser 
discussed 
concern is the growing power 
disparity in the Senate. Each 
state is represented equally in 
the Senate, as opposed to the 
House where representation is 
proportional to population. At 

the time of the Constitution’s 
ratification, the population of 
the smallest state, Delaware, 
was roughly 10 percent of that of 
the largest state, Virginia using 
the 
official 
representation 
metric.
Today, 
the 
gap 
between 
the biggest states and the 
smallest states has widened 
considerably. 
The 
smallest 
state, Wyoming, is a paltry 1.5 
percent of the population of 
the largest state, California. 
Combined, Texas and California 
have the same population as the 
smallest 28 states put together. 
This is staggering: two equal-
sized groups of people, one 
represented by four senators, 
and the other represented by 56. 
This disparity will only grow 
wider, since the three most 
populous states – California, 
Texas 
and 
Florida 
– 
also 
accounted for half of population 
growth nationwide at the time 
of the last presidential election. 
If 
small 
states 
were 
a 
roughly even mix of partisan-
leanings, 
then 
maybe 
this 
trend would be another curious 
quirk with little impact on 
legislative outcomes, but the 
fact is that smaller states tend 
to 
be 
disproportionately 
conservative, 
granting 
the 
Republican Party a significant 
institutional 
advantage. 
Gridlock 
in 
Washington 
could also be exacerbated if 
the Senate’s ideological bent 
becomes permanently out of 
sync with the House, which 
will more closely represent the 
nation’s ideological breakdown 
due 
to 
its 
proportional 
representation.
Our democratic institutions 
have adapted before (see the 
12th, 15th, 17th, 19th and 22nd 
Amendments as examples), but 
further evolution is necessary to 
ensure our elected government 
truly represents the will of 
the people. Any substantive 
reform would probably require 
a constitutional amendment 
and 
is 
therefore 
unlikely. 
Nonetheless, as a country we 
are quickly approaching a point 
where 
institutional 
reform 
is needed, or we run the risk 
of our republic becoming an 
unrepresentative democracy.

O

n Oct. 8, 2019, rape 
allegations 
against 
Matt Lauer, a former 
host for NBC News, were made 
public. Lauer was fired in 2017 
for sexual misconduct, but 
the details were not publicly 
shared. Now, the details have 
come to light. Variety reported 
that in Ronan Farrow’s new 
book “Catch and Kill,” former 
NBC employee Brooke Nevils 
shares she was raped by Lauer 
at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. 
Since the report, many news 
outlets have covered the story. 
However, 
prominent 
social 
movements 
have 
remained 
silent about the allegations. 
The #MeToo and the Women’s 
March movements have not 
voiced 
support 
for 
Brooke 
Nevils. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
allegations are not receiving 
the widespread attention that 
they deserve. 
Sexual assault has been 
a 
major 
news 
topic 
with 
the inauguration of Donald 
Trump, the Harvey Weinstein 
conviction 
and 
the 
Brett 
Kavanaugh hearings. With the 
birth of the #MeToo movement, 
survivors have come forward 
with their allegations, both 
anonymously and publicly. As 
more survivors came forward, 
social movements worked to 
support the survivors as the 
news cycled through their 
stories, providing resources 
and 
publicly 
supporting 
the 
survivors’ 
statements. 
It is surprising these social 
movements have not voiced 
support for Brooke Nevils. 
Their 
actions 
contradict 
the purpose of the #MeToo 
movement and the idea of 
solidarity 
in 
the 
Women’s 
March movement. Even after 
Farrow’s book was released 
on Oct. 15, #MeToo and the 
Women’s March have been 
silent on the allegations. There 
is no excuse for their behavior. 

The #MeToo and Women’s 
March movements create safe 
spaces for people to share 
their stories and traumas. On a 
national level, the movements 
help survivors who stand up to 
the celebrities who assaulted 
them, such as comedian Bill 
Cosby and producer Harvey 
Weinstein. Both were powerful 
men who used their status to 
scare their subordinates and 
get away with rape. Lauer is 
no different. 
The story can be construed 
as complicated and fabricated: 
Nevils was drunk during the 
assault and had consensual sex 
with Lauer after the assault. 
Many online commenters are 
using these behaviors against 
Nevils. The comments on this 
Facebook video blame Nevils 
for being drunk, and they 
discredit her because she had 
consensual sex with him after 
the assault. 
However, the case is not as 
complicated as some people 
claim. In fact, it is harrowingly 
simple: Nevils was drunk, and 
Lauer took advantage of her. 
She later had “consensual” sex 
with him, which she shares in 
a statement to Variety: “This 
is the Matt Lauer … who I 
feared when I continued to 
engage with him, as many 
victims 
of 
acquaintance 
rape do, particularly in the 
workplace.” 
Nevils’ 
actions 
following the assault are not 
out of the ordinary, and they 
do not discredit her story. As 
many sexual assault survivors 
are, she was afraid of the 
workplace 
consequences, 
especially since Lauer was the 
host of the Today Show and 
she was only a staffer. Nevils 
acknowledges this, remarking 
that Lauer was the “most 
powerful asset at NBC News.” 
Lauer had power over Nevils, 
especially after he brutally 
raped her. 

When Nevils reported to 
NBC in 2017, she asked her 
report be investigated and for 
Lauer to have the chance to 
defend himself. She did the 
same when she shared her 
story 
with 
Farrow. 
Nevils 
provided 
“dates, 
times, 
evidence of communications, 
and corroborating accounts,” 
and both NBC and Farrow 
found her allegations to be 
credible. Yet the public is 
quick to attack Nevils, and 
the social movements famed 
for supporting women and 
survivors have remained silent. 
When someone decides to 
come forward with a sexual 
assault, they are not doing so 
for more money or five minutes 
of fame. Many come forward 
to relieve the burden of the 
assault and to continue their 
personal 
healing 
process. 
Not every survivor feels the 
need to come forward, but for 
those who do, it is extremely 
important. 
Strong 
social 
support is key, especially if 
the allegations are against a 
popular or beloved celebrity 
such as Lauer. News outlets 
and social media users will 
victim-blame 
and 
discredit 
the accuser, but support from 
#MeToo movements can help 
survivors 
process 
through 
being scrutinized in the public 
eye. But by remaining silent 
when Nevils came forward, the 
#MeToo and Women’s March 
have failed Nevils and fellow 
survivors. With no prominent 
social support, Nevils’ story 
is diminished to another rape 
story, a statistic. Her story is 
kept from being more than a 
day’s breaking news, allowing 
criticism of Nevils to build 
and allowing Lauer’s popular 
legacy to remain as a former 
television host.

With the word “magic” in the title, “The Magic Flute” 
is bound to be an exciting adventure. The famous tale 
by composer Amadeus Mozart details the love story of 
Tamino, a young traveler, and Pamina, daughter of the 
Queen of the Night, and the trials Tamino has to endure 
to rescue Pamina and be together. What made this 
performance magical was not fairy queens or enchanted 
trials, but the expert blend of cultures, stories and 
realities.

The Isango Ensemble, a collection of South African 
performers of all ages, is a unique group that reimagines 
Western theatre classics in a South African context. 
Blending cultures, races and experiences, the group 
presents innovative works that transform a famous 
classic into a seemingly entirely new story. They 
bring their works of cultural fusion all over the world, 
including a variety of people into the conversation. Their 
production of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” was one of 
their many ingenious inventions of taking a while known 
classic and making it almost unrecognizable in the best 
possible ways. 
Milling around the Power Center stage before the 

show, the cast chatted with each other, looking out into 
the growing house, making the audience feel comfortable 
in their unexpected, un-operatic surroundings. The 
actors doubled as the musicians, with the music director 
taking on just as big of a role onstage right next to them. 
Everything about this performance was exposed: 
the wings and the roof of the stage were uncovered, 
there were barely any props, all the trials that Tamino 
went through were portrayed by actors shaking sheets 
with Sharpie letters on them. Yes, having the set of an 
internationally touring show consist of bedsheets was 
a bit perplexing. But in the context of the show — with 
dustbins for drums and recycled bottles for sounds — it 
made perfect sense. The set let the performance speak 
for itself
This version of the famous opera was unexpectedly 
humorous and playful. Papageno, Tamino’s sidekick, 
stole the show with his hilarious side comments and 
facial expressions. The Spirits were portrayed as a version 
of The Supremes, dancing in different sixties inspired 
costumes and hyping up the playful, snapping trio image. 
Papageno even made a reference to Gloria Gaynor and 
her famous song “I Will Survive.” All of these little quirks 
made the show accessible and interesting. It drew the 
audience in and made us feel like we were a part of the 
show ourselves.
The most compelling part of this show was the 
beautiful blend of cultures. Languages blended together 
seamlessly, weaving in and out of dialogue and song. But 
no matter what language scenes were done in, everything 
was still understandable. If one actor began speaking in a 
different language, not only would that actor still succeed 
in getting her point across, but the scene partner would 
pick up the slack and her reactions would explain the 
scene.
These intercultural conversations that the Isango 
Ensemble perpetrated are what push theater to progress. 
Just performing the same shows the same way does 
nothing to enhance the narrative. Innovation and 
creativity leads to discovery, all of which is presented in 
the works of the Isango Ensemble.

While nothing of the type quite exists, the closest 
thing to a surefire formula for a successful TV show 
is following a group of absurd characters with hefty 
delusions of grandeur. From David Brent and Michael 
Scott in both versions of “The Office” to Jimmy Shive-
Overly in “You’re the Worst,” we love characters 
whose egos are only eclipsed by their incompetence. 
BBC Three’s “People Just Do Nothing,” in its five 
short seasons, perfected this formula yet remains, to 
this day, criminally underappreciated compared to its 
inspirations.
This “Office”-style mockumentary centers around 
Kurupt FM, a pathetically small pirate radio station 
based out of Brentford in West London. Run by “MC 
Grindah” (Allan Mustafa) and “DJ Beats” (Hugo 
Chegwin), the illegal setup has an operating radius 
of about two blocks, but doesn’t stop the pair from 
deluding themselves that they take over the London 
airwaves every time they play. Other staff include 
“Steves,” a stoner who displays infrequent flashes of 
remarkable intelligence and Decoy, the straight man 
to Grindah’s overall outrageousness.
Despite the fact that each of these characters are 
noteworthy on their own, they are eclipsed by one of 
the most absurdly funny characters ever to grace a TV 
screen: Chabuddy G (Chabuds to his mates, Charlie 
to his colleagues), portrayed by Asim Chaudhry. 
Also known as “Brown Casanova” and the “Mayor 
of Hounslow,” he is a potent combination of Alan 
Partridge and the aforementioned David Brent/

Michael Scott all rolled into one. A self-proclaimed 
“entrepreneur,” he provides most of the “resources” 
to the Kurupt FM crew as well as his own products, 
including a vodka made of window polish which he 
markets as “Polish vodka” as a legal loophole.
Perhaps the show’s biggest asset is the chemistry 
that the cast has built up over the years. Before the 
show even piloted, most of the actors on the show 
worked together on a YouTube sketch series which 
parodied the underground radio stations that 
permeated the grime/garage scene in the UK, a scene 
which many of the actors were themselves a part of. 
As Sam Wallaston of The Guardian points out in an 
interview with the cast, the show is both a parody and 
a homage to that world, down to the “music samples 
and trainer [sneaker] brands,” not to mention the 
glorious array of tracksuits.
While the relatively niche aspects of the music are 
important to the show, the charm comes from the basic 
fact that most of the characters are blithering idiots, or 
at least they seem to be. Apart from Chabuddy G, it is 
difficult to tell just how self-aware the characters are. 
Grindah tries to convince us that his daughter with 
his girlfriend Miche (Lily Brazier) appears mixed-
race (despite both parents being white) because he is a 
quarter cypriot, when it is clearly obvious that Decoy 
(who is Black) is the actual father. Miche, a hairdresser, 
herself tries to convince herself that it is her destiny 
to become a celebrity and that her boyfriend (later 
husband) is actually more than a musically hopeless 
MC. Yet at the end of the day, don’t we all have our own 
hopeless delusions about who we are and who we will 
be? As the Kurupt FM crew show, maybe that’s fine

TV NOTEBOOK

Isango Ensemble’s fresh
take on ‘The Magic Flute’

SAYAN GHOSH
Daily New Media Editor

Harry Styles’s “Lights Up” marks a two-
year gap between the releases of his last two 
singles. His presence never evaded the public 
eye, but the tribulations and subtleties of his 
personal life was never at the forefront. He 
coasts along in interviews with a sheer cheeky 
charm that never conveys too much and seldom, 
if ever, brands the gossip magazines you find 
at the grocery store. An artist to his very 
core, he captivates us in grand, eye-catching 
statements. Blooming from the teen heartthrob 
image of One Direction, he shed the wrapping 
but wore the attention on his sleeves. These 

were the sheer Gucci sleeves he co-hosted the 
Met Gala with this spring, the unrecognizable 
fervor he brought to the role of British soldier 
Alex in Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk,” the 
melodramatic, spiraling six-minute lucid dream 
of his 2017 single “Sign of the Times.”
“Lights Up” is a move no different. Clocking 
in at less than three minutes long, it is literally 
half the length of “Sign of the Times.” The 
’70s-inspired rock balladry makes way for a 
soulful airiness, a melange of synth, guitar, 
keys and choir music that sparkle with sweat. 

The lyrics pour out in abstracts, “I’m sorry by 
the way / Never coming around / Be so sweet if 
things just stayed the same,” a seemingly hazy 
cliche. But with a release on National Coming 
Out Day, “Lights up and they know who you 
are / Do you know who you are?” plays out a 
grander proclamation. 
Regardless of whether the fan speculations 
hold true, Styles furthers the idea of a coming-
out statement in the “Lights Up” music video. No 
formal narrative or symbol congeals the overall 
plot; instead, glimpses of a glimmering, sweaty 
Harry Styles grace the screen. Set completely 
in the dark, it shines in bursts of green, red 
and white lights that alternate and illuminate 
Styles’s journey throughout the video. The 
images feels otherworldly as Styles traverses 
through them effortlessly. At the 
very focal point, he is entangled 
within 
a 
throng 
of 
sensuous 
admirers of all genders. They 
glisten under a pale neon-green 
light, pressing their barebodies 
against Styles’s as he sings. Other 
images fill in gaps between this 
scene, namely one of Styles seated 
back-to-back on a motorcycle with 
an anonymous chauffeur and one 
of him partially submerged in 
water while wearing a sequined 
suit, reflected over a version of himself in boxer 
shorts.
The significance behind these images and 
the video are dubious, but they are imbued in 
an ether of sensuality. They oscillate between a 
desire for exploration and a visible frustration 
on Styles’s face in some cuts, culminating to 
an unconventional, almost strange aura as 
we struggle to pinpoint the ramifications of 
Styles’s situation. But for a song that questions 
if you know who you are, such imagery seems 
appropriate.

Since its release at the close of September, Ryan 
Murphy’s “The Politician” has gotten its shine from six 
days to Sunday. And rightly so — the writing, while a 
bit ham-fisted even for the Netflix generation’s answer 
to “Bonfire of the Vanities,” dives head first into the 
kinds of topics that can easily veer into trivializing 
and exploitative landscapes with aplomb. It does so by 
immediately going for the jugular, hitting you upside 
the head with the bluntness of its message in the most 
camped up, almost-derisive fashion, discrediting 
itself and rendering all defenses null before it actually 
starts to hit home. The tangled relationship between 
emotional centeredness and youthful ambition, 
the ever-climbing bar for achievement cloaked in 
little more than sheer existential dread, what it 
means to be your “authentic self,” the simultaneous 
condemnation and idolization of extreme wealth 
and all the particulars of loneliness, anxiety and 
depression (especially in reference to queerness) are 
baked into a televised sheet cake both indelicately and 
with great care.
The real storytelling jewels, however, lie in 
the show’s visuals. The dichotomy of reality and 
the common portrayal is co-signed by an endless 
cornucopia of truly fabulous backdrops. The makeup 
of each scene — how every room is decorated and 
the way the architecture helps inform the space, the 
personal styling of each character and how it betrays 
their intentions, while placing them neatly into the 
overall visual narrative — lifts an immense amount 
of weight. It’s a classic Ryan Murphy spectacle with 
every still, but the ideas expressed are so clear and 
immediate that there isn’t any real margin of error. It 
serves as a reminder of just how much can be said of 
oneself when you dress with intention.
Not everybody gets to be Gwyneth Paltrow, 
trimming her hedges in a poppy red Carolina Herrera 
gown and matching crochet gloves or a downtrodden 
Lucy Boynton furiously practicing her serve in the 
middle of the night in tennis whites, complete with a 
bold-striped cashmere sweater that says TENNIS on 
it (and neither are necessarily intended as realistic 
options). Embodying a character can afford the 
opportunity to escape from the mores of commonly 
accepted personal styles and the wider norms that 

inform them. The characters of “The Politician” 
succeed so thrillingly in their personal style because 
they poke fun at their identities, at the pomp and 
circumstance of getting dressed for a particular role 
and all that comes with it. The downright comedic 
drama that comes with their wares doesn’t exist off-
screen, but a touch of self-awareness and a willingness 
to subvert our chosen roles can go a long way.
I find gender so interesting because it completely 
eludes me. When I think of myself in my own private 
headspace there is no underlying status that feels like 
home, and I think a very large part of why I, along with 
many members of the queer community, so prefer 
to be alone is because that untetheredness becomes 
real when you’re around other people. To defy 
something so ingrained in how people conceptualize 
themselves and go about their life, or even to feel like 

what you project doesn’t quite fit, is to be forced to 
think about all of the different places it’s steeped in. It 
is to be conscious of it, all the time, and every choice 
in how you represent yourself can quickly feel like a 
negotiation as a result. As hard as anyone can try, there 
is no vacuum you can self-actualize in. We are raised 
through a series of negotiations between who we are 
and what we’re born with, and pursuing concepts, as 
opposed to perceptions, is one way to create a home 
within yourself. It’s a way to put yourself in the driver’s 
seat, to self-satirize, to navigate the social pressures 
we inevitably adhere to in some way or another with a 
little bit more agency.

Remember 2009? “Zombieland: Double Tap” does. 
When its predecessor, “Zombieland,” was released, 
zombies still felt fresh. “The Walking Dead” hadn’t 
premiered yet and its deluge of ripoffs were still years 
away. The early 2000s’ “28 Days Later” and “Dawn of 
the Dead” had just resurrected the genre by introducing 
sprinting zombies, which “Zombieland” made good use 
of. 
“Zombieland” was an amusing horror comedy with 
just enough bite to raise it above mediocrity. The gory 
zombie sequences were fun and Jesse Eisenberg (“The 
Social Network”), who plays the main character in both 
films, hadn’t become annoying yet. It was 2009’s best 
Halloween movie. 
But it’s not 2009. It’s 2019, and “Zombieland: Double 
Tap” has lost its edge. Obscenely violent slow motion 
montages, apocalyptic sitcom style humor and meta 
references are a dime a dozen these days. Einsenberg’s 
voiceovers are also groan-inducingly on the nose. Even 
if the occasional joke hits its mark, there is nothing 
memorable.
Practically every character is defined by a simple 
characteristic. 
Characters 
that 
exist 
solely 
as 
stereotypes 
(arguably) 
may 
have been alright 
in 2009, but they 
aren’t so easy to 
forgive in 2019, 
especially 
when 
these stereotypes 
lean towards the 
problematic. There’s the weed-loving hippie and the 
dumb blonde, characters even 2019’s prime time TV 
would deem overly simplistic and offensive. 
Most of the characterization issues involve the film’s 
women. They all are obsessed with finding boyfriends, 
even though society itself has collapsed. Nevada, played 
by Rosario Dawson (“Rent”), is treated as a sexual 
object, argued over and literally compared to a driveway 
to be parked in, and she doesn’t seem to mind too much. 

Abigail Breslin’s (“Little Miss Sunshine”) Little Rock 
leaves her sister to die for the first man she meets. Even 
the fiercely independent Wichita, played by Emma 
Stone (“La La Land”), makes choices that come from a 
writer who believes that all women want to do is shack 
up with the only available man. 
Tallahassee’s (Woody Harrellson, “The Hunger 
Games”) controlling, aggressive attitude isn’t funny 
anymore, especially not when women are involved. His 
love of guns hasn’t aged well and, even in the context 
of a zombie apocalypse, rings a little tone deaf. After 
the violence of the last decade, scenes of Tallahassee 
worshipping automatic weapons just aren’t as funny as 
the movie wants them to be. No scenes in “Zombieland: 
Double Tap” are, in fact. 
Stone and Harrellson’s talent is wasted on an 
unoriginal script that never reaches even the modest 
highs “Zombieland” did. Everything effective about 
the movie was done better in the first — every “Zombie 
Rule” and “Zombie Kill of The Week” gimmick just 
seems stale now.
The film meanders from zombie set piece to zombie set 
piece and from bad joke to bad joke, shambling around the 
same overworked ground “Zombieland” trod a decade 
ago. Instead of Bill Murray’s house, it’s Elvis’s. Instead 
of a climatic zombie battle at a carnival, it’s at a colorful, 
carnivalesque 
hippie 
commune. 
The only scene 
worth watching 
is 
after 
the 
credits, 
when 
Bill 
Murray 
returns for a 
wild 
zombie 
killing 
spree 
that has more 
laughs than the entire movie itself. Check it out on 
Youtube.
“Zombieland: Double Tap” is an exhausted, 
forgettable misfire from the eternally churning 
blockbuster sequel machine. It has just enough frivolous 
violence and juvenile humor to live on through the 
nighttime TV circuit, buried between “Simpsons” 
reruns, coming back to yearn for the one thing it doesn’t 
have: brains.

Keep ‘Zombieland’ dead

FILM REVIEW

A few lines from Mount Eerie’s “Distortion” is 
the most concise way to explain Ames Hawkins’s 
pilgrimage in her book “These are Love(d) Letters.”
“… In the same way that my descendants will squint 
back through a fog / Trying to see some polluted 
version of all I meant to be in life / Their recollections 
pruned by the accidents of time / What got thrown 
away and what gets talked about at night …”
What doesn’t get thrown away are twenty short 
letters written in the mid ’60s. Hawkins’s father, a 
closeted gay man at the time, wrote these letters to her 
mother. After meeting at summer camp, the two kept 
a correspondence between New York and Michigan. 
Years later, after a divorce and her father’s fatal battle 
with AIDS, her mother would hand her these letters 
in an Ann Arbor coffee shop. She doesn’t know why 
she kept them. 
The book annotates these letters with every 
relevant detail, even when her descriptions must cross 
massive gaps between genres and subjects. Different 
colored text, sometimes with no other transition, 
marks a change in the literary style. It sometimes reads 
like a literary magazine: True stories are blended with 
essays on Derrida and Cixous, phone transcripts and 
drawings. 
Hawkins 
pinpoints 
subjects 
embedded 
in 
the letters that are as complicated and varied as 
real life should be. Sexuality is one such subject, 
simultaneously treated analytically and emotionally. 
In one paragraph, she counts the 49 times her father 
says he loves Hawkins’s mother in the letters. In the 
next, she laments it wasn’t 50. 
Literature is another area of focus. The book is 
as interested in writing, as you can expect from 
such a skilled author. The closing chapter stops to 
reflect on how endings in general should be written. 
Hawkins attempts to expand the boundaries of what 
is considered literature to letters. In a list of reasons 

why, she notes the range of uses for letters. Letters can 
be sent for young love or for declarations of war. And 
Hawkins intends to include as many as possible.
The only whiplash from subject and style changes 
are from discussions that take some philosophical 
knowledge for granted. But the academic approach 
doesn’t filter out the emotion in the book’s hard truths, 
especially in regard to Hawkins’s father’s health.
The love letters ground the book in the mundane. 
Being reminded of the reality of death or trauma can 
feel like “waking up” to a world outside the one where 
you stand in line for the bus or check your email. But 
Hawkins ties them all together to one linear timeline. 

This ambitious experiment in literary forms and ideas 
might be jarring in many circumstances. 
The book undertakes the impossible job of showing 
others how some seemingly small detail reverberates 
in all parts of life. Everything seems authentically 
connected. The complex overarching narratives 
Hawkins draws out are never forced. In the hands 
of a less skilled writer, such comparisons might have 
broken down like fever dreams that make sense until 
recounted to others. For instance, Hawkins finds a few 
lines in one letter regarding her father’s anxiety about 
teeth falling out that form a grim foreshadowing of the 
effects of AIDS on his oral health. This book gives the 
reader the impression that if they study anything with 
enough care, they’ll find a fractal — any small detail 
containing the whole. 
Her father didn’t mind Hawkins’s previous 
writings about him. And still, she treats these letters 

like sacred text, but it’s hard to feel that way for long.
Moreover, some of the most delicate information 
comes from Hawkins herself. Through these letters, 
Hawkins maps the roots of herself and her happiest 
and worst memories. She delves into the hard truths of 
herself and her trauma’s origins. In this way, Hawkins 
paints these letters as equally relevant to her life’s 
context as her birth.
Yet, the book can be simultaneously nonchalant. 
One can almost see the shrug as the author admits 
she doesn’t know why, for instance, more love letter 
anthologies have been published recently. These shifts 
in style don’t hurt the flow. Like the best anthology 
records or essay collections, the fast transitions keep 
each page a surprise.
Moreover, 
these 
complexities 
reflect 
the 
complicated, grey, and conflicting experiences 
embedded in these letters. One passage, retold here 
without font changes, breaks the fourth wall to give 
reader instructors:
“And now, Dear Reader, use your breath … Notice 
where your mind goes as you follow my finger pointing 
out over the horizon. Recognize me, there: Ah, yes! 
And now your eyes really find focus: Ah-ha.
Look hard.
If you do, I am sure that you’ll see yourself there, 
too.”
In “These are Love(d) Letters,” Ames Hawkins 
doesn’t just squint back to see what her parents 
meant to be. In the mundane objects of the past’s 
fog, Hawkins finds a mirror reflecting herself. Many 
find their reflection in their favorite books or movies. 
But standing in a different place will bring a unique 
reflection, even in the same mirror. It takes a writer 
like Hawkins to make one see reflections of both 
themselves and the author.

BOOK REVIEW

Rex Orange County gave fans a taste of his 
upcoming album Pony, set to release on Oct. 
25, with his new single “Pluto Projector.” The 
singer-songwriter surprised fans a day before 
dropping the single by tweeting out his phone 
number, allowing fans to hear a snippet of the 
tune via his voicemail. 
Rex released his first single off the new 
album, 10/10, back in early September, and 
while he still maintains the level of sincerity 
he was able to capture in the previous single, 
“Pluto Projector” is more soulful and organic 
with its relaxed vocals and clean drum beats. 
The song starts off with a quiet guitar riff as 
Rex confesses his love to his significant other 
and ends each line with a casual vocal scale. 
Like many of Rex’s songs, the single doesn’t 
have a clear structure, as it runs start to finish 
without any repetition of lines; however, the 
song starts to pick up in the middle with the 

introduction of a piano riff laced between 
the lead vocals and a collection of haunting 
harmonies lingering in the background. Rex 
imagines himself in wedlock, singing “I hope 
the encore lasts forever / now there’s time for us 
to spend,” a sweet ode to the beauty of a timeless 

love. “Pluto Projector” reminds us of the joy 
found in sharing life’s journey with someone 
you love and showcases Rex’s craft for creating 
heartfelt intimacy through songwriting.

Pushing for a breakthrough year

Before 
every 
season, 
two 
things are always on the mind of 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team: the next steps and the 
expectations.
Six years ago, the next step 
was simply to get better, to go 
further than the third round of 
the WNIT. Three years ago, the 
Wolverines were given the cold 
shoulder by the NCAA selection 
committee – and they won the 
WNIT instead. The next year, 
they made the tournament for the 
first time in four years.
Now, for the first time in the 
program’s 
history, 
Michigan 
is looking for its third straight 
NCAA Tournament bid. For the 
first time in the programs history, 
the Wolverines are shooting for 
the Sweet Sixteen – or higher.
The next steps are steeper than 
ever. The expectations are taller 
than ever.
“It kind of goes with one 
of the reasons why I chose 
Michigan,” said junior forward 
Hailey Brown. “I chose here 
to come to a school that we’re 

working 
towards 
something. 
We haven’t won a conference 
championship. My group hasn’t 
made it to the Sweet Sixteen. So 
that’s something we’re trying to 
do, each year do better. I think 
this year I’m just really excited, 
looking forward to accomplishing 
these things and really pushing 
through the grind with these 
girls.
Unlike other sports, though, 
it’s not all in Michigan’s hands. 
Women’s 
college 
basketball 
is 
incredibly 
top-heavy, 
and 
when playing on the opponents’ 
courts on the first weekend 
of the tournament, it’s nearly 
impossible to advance. The last 
two years, the Wolverines have 
been bounced by a two and one 
seed, respectively.
“In women’s basketball, so 
much is predicated on your seed,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “And getting that seed 
where you’re going to play a one 
or two in the first round on their 
home court is really tough. We’ve 
got to get ourselves out of those 
positions. … So the goal for this 
year’s team is to keep advancing, 
keep moving forward.”

In the preseason poll, Michigan 
was picked to come in second 
in the Big Ten by the media, 
behind frontrunners Maryland. 
Sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
was one of two players selected 
preseason all-Big Ten by both the 
media and coaches.
The star sophomore class is 
a year older, and Barnes Arico 
keeps bringing in top-notched 
recruits. The players aren’t as 
timid as their coach about this 
season.
 “We definitely want the Big 
Ten championships, we want to 
go there,” Brown said. “I think 
last year we had a tough one 
against Maryland when we lost 
in the Big Ten tournament. I 
think every year we’re just trying 
to build and build, and we’ve done 
that. I’m a junior now, my third 
year, so we’re trying to make a 
run to the Sweet Sixteen this 
year. We need to get a Big Ten 
Championship, for sure.”
For 
the 
Wolverines, 
improvement has been the sole 
focus under Barnes Arico. Every 
year, the team’s made a step 
forward, but this year, reaching 
the next level is harder than ever.

Wolverines learning how to play with a lead

The 
adrenaline. 
The 
desperation. The urgency. 
Giving everything you have to 
try and score that tying goal.
Playing from behind is a 
situation Michigan found itself 
in often last season. 
When 
the 
Wolverines 
opened regular season play 
two weeks ago against then-
No. 11 Clarkson, they found 
themselves back in that familiar 
spot: hunting to even the score. 
In 
Friday’s 
game, 
during 
the closing minutes of the first 
period, the Golden Knights 
struck first — converting on the 
power play in its dying seconds. 
Michigan mustered a second-
period goal for a 1-1 tie.
Saturday, however, it was 
unable to overcome the 2-0 hole 
it had fallen into. Its efforts 
as the minutes 
wound 
down 
were 
valiant, 
but not enough. 
When the game 
ended, 
the 
Wolverines had 
lost, 3-1.
“Obviously, 
playing 
up 
is 
what you want to 
do,” said junior 
forward Michael 
Pastujov. “Playing from behind 
was what we struggled with a 
lot last year. We started a lot of 
games down early, so it’s kind of 
hard to climb back up.”
Michigan plays 34 games in a 
season, so every night — every 
opportunity to eke out points to 
help its position in the standings 
— matters. And through the 
course of the weekend series 
with Clarkson, they faced the 
harsh realities of falling behind 
early in a game. It’s challenging 
to come back from being down, 
as evidenced by the Wolverines’ 
13-win season last year. 
Going into last week against 
Lake Superior State, Michigan 
knew it needed to strike first. 

It couldn’t afford to give up an 
early goal against a defensive-
minded team like the Lakers. It 
had to come ready to play, and 
both nights, it did.
Friday, sophomore forward 
Nolan Moyle was the first of four 
skaters to rifle the puck into the 
back of the net. Just five and a 
half minutes into the game, the 
Wolverines had the lead. It was 
writing a new narrative, and 
leaving last season’s in the past. 
It wasn’t a team that was going 
to play from behind. It was a 
team that was ready to take 
control.
The 
Wolverines 
looked 
comfortable. 
They 
showed 
glimpses 
of 
their 
potential. 
The pressure wasn’t on them 
any more — they were the ones 
applying it.
“Against 
those 
teams 
(Clarkson and Lake Superior), 
the 
way 
their 
style 
is, 
I 
thought it was 
important,” said 
Michigan coach 
Mel 
Pearson. 
“Because 
they’re so strong 
defensively 
and 
that’s their M.O., 
you want to get 
them out of their 
game. You want 
to get them to 
play more of an 
up and down game.”
In even less time than the 
Wolverines grabbed their lead 
over the Lakers on Friday, 
sophomore 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert connected with the 
puck and sent a shot whistling 
into the netting. Just like that, 
the lead was theirs.
Junior forward Jack Becker 
followed in Lambert’s footsteps 
and tallied two early goals in 
the opening period, and before 
the first period had ended, 
Michigan tripled its advantage.
The next 20 minutes were 
much more turbulent. Seemingly 
as quick as it had earned a 
three-goal lead, Lake Superior 
State found its way back in the 

game with two goals. But the 
Wolverines 
clung 
to 
their 
one-goal 
advantage with 
senior 
captain 
Will Lockwood 
heading 
the 
charge.
In the locker 
room, Lockwood 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
positivity. 
Michigan didn’t 
have the period it wanted, but 
the scoreboard didn’t reflect 

it. It didn’t need to panic the 
way it had in 
the past, when 
it was searching 
for a last-minute 
tying goal. The 
Wolverines 
just needed to 
stick 
to 
their 
game plan and 
execute. 
They 
maintained 
the 
lead, something 
they 
weren’t 
often capable of 
doing last year.
“Positive team talk in the 

locker room,” said Lockwood. 
“(The 
Lakers) 
came 
out 
Saturday 
night 
and scored two 
goals right away 
in 
the 
second. 
And they didn’t 
take the lead, but 
I think that just 
goes with team 
talk and trying to 
keep everyone up 
and not have that 
big 
momentum 
switch, 
that 
momentum 
is 
huge.”

It’s the exact momentum 
the Wolverines 
rarely 
felt 
last season — 
the feeling of 
playing with the 
lead. 
“You’ll 
have 
to look at the 
statistics,” 
Lockwood said. 
“But 
I 
think 
the team that 
scores 
first 
wins most of the 
games so to get that (first) one is 
important, it’s huge.”

Michigan finishes season strong, 
with fourth place weekend finish

After a rocky start to its fall 
season, the Michigan men’s golf 
team came to a strong finish.
Following 
last 
week’s 
competition at Crooked Stick, 
where the team ended 10th out of 
14 teams, the Wolverines arrived 
at the Royal Oak Intercollegiate 
tournament on Monday with a 
renewed mindset— one focused 
on putting the past behind them.
In the first round of the game, 
Michigan had already set itself 
apart from the other 11 teams. 
After the first 18 holes, junior 
Charlie Pilon and senior Brent 
Ito claimed first and second 
place with 67 and 68 points, 
respectively.
Thanks to the help of the rest 
of the team, the Wolverines 
were able to finish first overall. 
This strong start proved to be a 
welcome change for Michigan. 
 “They’re learning, which is 
a good thing. They’re learning 
from 
their 
mistakes,” 
said 
Michigan coach Zach Barlow. 
“They’re seeing that they don’t 
have to go out there and really 
do anything special, they just 
have to play good solid golf. It’s 
not about individual honors, it’s 
all about the team.” 
In the following rounds, this 
team-centered 
mindset 
and 
confidence in their game helped 
the Wolverines continue to fight 
towards victory.
Michigan 
slipped 
down 
to fourth place in the second 
round, mainly due to several 
bogeys from the players. Brent 
Ito lost his 2nd place ranking 
as a result of bogeys on the 1st, 
8th, 12th, and 14th holes, ending 
the round even par (142) in 17th 
place. Despite this slight drop 
overall, Pilon remained steady 
throughout the second round, 
remaining in first place at 
6-under-par.
As the team geared up for 

its third and final round at 
Royal 
Oak’s 
Intercollegiate 
on Tuesday, Pilon was feeling 
the pressure to maintain his 
winning streak. 
“I definitely had a bit of 
nerves,” Pilon said. “It was 
probably the different format 
for this event— the five of 
us grouped together instead 
of with other teams— that 
helped me calm down a bit and 
regroup. Obviously I wanted to 
do a good job individually, but I 
also wanted to help the team as 
much as I could, which helped 
me take my mind off of it a little 
bit.”
The 
third 
round 
saw 
improvement 
for 
many 
of 
Michigan’s players. Brent Ito 
was able to hit his 5th, 6th and 
14th holes under par, leading 
him to finish in 13th place 
overall. This gave him his third 
top-15 
individual 
finish 
of 
the season. Additionally, Ben 
Dunne improved in the third 
round, ending two under par 
with 69 points (73-78-69).
Pilon 
faced 
some 
slight 
challenges in the third round, 

hitting bogeys on the 3rd and 
10th hole. Regardless of this, 
he was able to come out on top, 
keeping his first-place title and 
ending the tournament with 
205 points (67-69-69). 
With 
these 
scores, 
the 
Wolverines were able to end 
the tournament in fourth place 
overall. 
While enjoying the feeling of 
his second collegiate win and a 
career-low of 205 (8 under par), 
Pilon was complimentary of his 
team’s overall progress. 
“We had a bit of a slow start 
to the season,” Pilon said, “but 
we definitely pulled through 
coming out of this week.”
With a win to end to its fall 
season, 
Michigan 
is 
ready 
to begin preparing for their 
upcoming season in the spring. 
The 
team’s 
focus 
while 
preparing for the next season 
will be on their short game. 
“Our short games, chipping, 
putting, 
they 
need 
to 
get 
better,” Barlow says, “If we’re 
going to be the team we desire 
to be, our short game has to get 
better.”

To Nico Collins, it was as 
perplexing on the re-watch as in 
the moment.
He saw the ball in the air on 
Saturday, readjusting to the 
slightly-underthrown 
deep 
ball, hauling in what appeared 
to be a momentum-shifting 
45-yard reception down to the 
Penn State 10-yard line. Exactly 
what the doctor ordered for an 
offense looking to respond to a 
red-hot Nittany Lions start.
Then 
he 
saw 
the 
flag. 
Offensive 
pass 
interference. 
Catch 
nullified. 
Momentum 
drained.
“Oh yeah, I saw it in slow 
motion. It was terrible,” Collins 
said. “ … He was pulling on me. 
I was kinda pulling on him. We 
were both competing for it … 
but (the call) was on me. Can’t 
complain about it.
“It can kinda be hard, cause a 
play like that is very explosive. 
If we had got that, we’d be down 
on the 15-yard line in a position 
to score. So we gotta go all the 
way back from where we was.” 
It was one of two offensive 
pass 
interference 
calls 
on 
Michigan during the game, 
the types of 50/50 plays that 
are easier to single out in 
what ended a razor-thin, one-
possession game. In the end, 
the Wolverines were flagged 
eight times for 48 yards, while 
Penn State had five penalties for 
58 yards. That relatively even 
distribution did little to quell 
complaints.
“There were some (bad calls), 
definitely,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “You have 
the human reaction of what 
your human reactions are and 
sometimes it’s not fair. I’ve said 
for a long time, the only fair is 
the county fair. Respect it. You 

can be disappointed sometimes. 
“Looked at those, make no 
excuse and move onward.”
Kwity Paye breaking out
With any defensive end, the 
sacks and tackles-for-loss are 
what catch the casual fan’s eye. 
Junior Kwity Paye certainly is 
no exception.
His 
dominant 
2.5-sack 
performance against Iowa laid 
the foundation for what appears 
to be a breakout season. And 
yet, to defensive line coach 
Shaun Nua, those are hardly the 
only notable football traits he 

possesses.
“I don’t know if he can grow 
even more with how well he 
plays the run,” Nua said. “He’s 
confident, and just doesn’t panic 
with all the RPOs and all the 
bluff that tight ends will have, 
the split zone, he just doesn’t 
panic. He knows exactly when 
they’re trying to kick him out, 
and when they’re not trying 
to kick him out. He’s always 
in his gap with great pad level 
and hands inside. So plays with 
great, phenomenal base. You’ll 
hardly see him on the ground. 

And then when he gets a pass 
rush, he can convert fast. He’s 
doing a great job.”
Paye and sophomore Aidan 
Hutchinson — self-nicknamed 
“salt 
and 
pepper” 
— 
have 
entrenched themselves firmly at 
the end positions, each offering 
versatility in their skillsets. 
In addition to his praise for 
Paye, Nua called Hutchinson a 
“complete player”, noting the 
duo’s ability to flip spots at any 
given time and fill each role.
Together, 
they’ve 
allowed 
Michigan’s defense to hardly 

skip a beat after the departures 
of Rashan Gary and Chase 
Winovich from a season ago.
Slow starts persist
In the aftermath of last 
week’s 21-0 blitz in the first 
half, Michigan has spent the 
week reflection on the trend 
of starting slowly in big games. 
Over 
the 
course 
of 
eight 
different top-15 matchups in the 
last two seasons, the Wolverines 
have been outscored 117-83 in 
the first half, including a 21-7 
deficit to the Nittany Lions and 
a 28-0 deficit to Wisconsin, both 

this year.
The 
answer 
to 
the 
two 
questions on everyone’s mind? 
No, the players don’t have one 
central rationale for the slow 
starts. Yes, they know they’ve 
got to do better.
“We can’t keep letting that be 
a trend,” said senior offensive 
lineman 
Ben 
Bredeson 
on 
Monday, “falling behind and 
having to come back. There (are) 
times when we got to start fast.”
Saturday, No. 8 Notre Dame 
comes to town. That would seem 
like an apt time to start fast.

Still plenty to play for, players say

When the ball hit Ronnie Bell’s 
hands then dropped harmlessly 
onto the turf, it symbolized the end 
of more than just the game.
In big-time college football, two 
losses mean no College Football 
Playoff. While a Big Ten title is still 
theoretically possible, it’s now very 
unlikely. Those were Michigan’s 
biggest goals coming into the 
season. No matter how much fight 
the Wolverines showed Saturday, 
those goals are essentially gone.
Under 
these 
kinds 
of 
circumstances, there is inevitably 
a debate about what the rest of the 
season means, and what there is to 
play for if there are no accolades on 
the horizon.
For Michigan, those answers 
seem to lie in the remaining games 
on the schedule — and a steadfast 
belief in themselves.
“A lot of people saying we have 
nothing to play for,” said fifth-
year senior offensive tackle Jon 
Runyan on Tuesday. “But we have 
everything to play for. We got all 
these guys in the locker room, we 
got all our coaches, we have our 
families that we’re playing for.”
Universally, players and coaches 
pointed to the next game on the 
schedule — a home game, at night, 
against traditional rival and top-10 
opponent in Notre Dame. Win that 
game, and while it might not mean 

anything in the conference race, 
it’ll mean something to a program 
that’s been invested in this rivalry 
for over a century.
In his Monday press conference, 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
preached 
the 
same thing he does before every 
game — “this week is the most 
important game of the season” — 
and while that may not be literally 
true anymore in the context of 
the Playoff, the significance of 
Saturday, and of upcoming rivalry 
games against Michigan State and 
Ohio State, isn’t lost on anyone.
On Monday, senior defensive 
tackle Carlo Kemp faced the 
scrum as normal, but the way he 
answered questions seemed like 
anything but a traditional media 
session. Instead, his words seemed 
like an impassioned speech, a plea 
for everyone to stop treating the 
season like it was over.
“What’s left to play is, we’ve 
got our whole season left,” Kemp 
said. “We’re at the midway point. 
We’ve got five games coming up. 
… And we’ve got three of the most 
important 
rivalries 
in 
college 
football coming up. You’ve got 
Notre Dame, you’ve got Michigan 
State and then you’ve got the game 
at the end of the year.
“And those are the games that 
you play for. Those are the teams 
that you’re gonna want to play for, 
and we’re not just gonna sit here 
and be like, ‘Alright, we’re done,’ 
and go out there and just coast the 

rest of the season.”
The Wolverines lost to the 
Fighting Irish last year. They have 
yet to beat the Spartans at home 
in Harbaugh’s tenure. And the 
Buckeyes? The 0-4 record speaks 
for itself. Those facts themselves 
present plenty for Michigan to play 
for — even if it’s not in the way it 
originally hoped.
Defensive line coach Shaun 
Nua and sophomore defensive 
end 
Aidan 
Hutchinson 
both 
admitted that it was tough to 
accept Saturday’s loss. But Nua 
was pleased with the response in 
Tuesday’s practice and the focus 
they showed in the face of adversity.
Against 
Notre 
Dame, 
the 
Wolverines will get the chance to 
prove that the season still means 
something to them, that there are 
still things to play for, even if there 
isn’t a trip to Indianapolis or New 
Orleans waiting for them at the 
end.
“Yes, we lost, but you’ve gotta 
remember, this isn’t our last game 
of the year,” Kemp said. “It’s not 
like, ‘Alright, we’re done, let’s 
start packing up and we’ll get 
ready for next season.’ We have 
top-10 matchups coming up and 
the big thing is, we have one this 
Saturday. And we have another 
opportunity on the national stage 
to go out there, play in front of our 
own fans and go out there and 
represent Michigan and play on a 
big stage.”

Franz Wagner embracing college

For many student athletes, 
taking the leap to college 
represents much of the same, if 
just on a bigger stage with more 
responsibilities.
Wake up. Go to school. Go to 
practice. Complete homework. 
Eat a ridiculous amount of 
calories. Go to sleep. Repeat.
Very few incoming college 
athletes buck this trend in the 
time between their high school 
days and their fledgling college 
careers. 
Franz 
Wagner 
is 
an 
exception. 
After finishing high school 
early, the guard played a year of 
professional ball for Alba Berlin 
in Germany’s Bundesliga. Now, 
he’s back in a classroom, and 
the 6-foot-8 wing couldn’t be 
happier about it.
Any high school students 
reading 
this 
are 
almost 
certainly 
scratching 
their 
hands at the moment. How 
could someone ever possibly 
elect to go back to school, 
especially after getting a taste 
of a professional basketball 
player’s lifestyle?
For Wagner, the answer to 
that question comes in the form 
of all of the resources Michigan 
has to offer, including allowing 
him to become a more well-
rounded human being. With 
the 
perspective 
of 
having 
played professional basketball, 
Wagner now appreciates a life 
that does not solely focus on the 
sport. 
“(Last year) I played the 
whole year of basketball, and 
I felt like it was really for the 
first couple of months, and I 
enjoyed it,” Wagner said. “Not 
having to go to school because 
I finished high school a year 
early, and that was really cool 
for the first couple of months. 
But after a certain period of 
time, you feel like, at least I felt 
like, I needed something more. 
And that’s part of why I came 
here.”
As 
a 
college 
freshman, 
Wagner enjoys spending time 
in the dorms and meeting new 

people who are not enmeshed 
in the world of basketball. He’s 
embracing his classes as well 
as expanding on his hobbies 
which include keeping up with 
politics and the media. 
It shows a wisdom beyond 
his years to recognize a desire 
to 
develop 
a 
well-rounded 
personality after having tasted 
life as a professional — an 
experience that will perhaps 
lend itself handily to his play on 
the court as well.
Coming in as a highly-touted 
freshman accompanied by a 
metric boatload of praise, many 
in the program are turning 
to Wagner to fill the void left 
by last season’s top offensive 
weapons 
in 
Jordan 
Poole, 
Ignas Brazdeikis and Charles 
Matthews.
The wing’s basketball IQ, 
passing 
ability, 
length 
and 
defensive ability have excited 
many around Crisler Center, 
which makes the news of his 
recent injury so devastating for 
the program. Wagner fractured 
his wrist and will now miss the 
next four to six weeks. 
It’s a crucial blow for the 
Wolverines early in what’s 
sure-to-be 
a 
transformative 
season, but once Wagner steps 
back into the lineup, his talents 
will shine through. At least, 
that’s what associate coach Phil 
Martelli believes.
“I would just suggest that if 
anybody’s on the fence, if there 
are tickets available, get your 
tickets,” Martelli said, “because 

you’re gonna want to see this 
kid play. He’s a guy that you 
come to practice every day and 
you leave and you just scratch 
your head. To be that age, to be 
that cerebral, to be that pure.
“And it’s subtle. It’s like, how 
did he know to defend there? 
How did he know to go with the 
right hand? He’s, and I don’t 
want to put a lot of pressure on 
him, but he’s rain man. He’s a 
rain man in basketball. He’s a 
savant.”
With such high praise and 
professional playing experience 
already under his belt, it’s no 
wonder the freshman will play 
at the next level again one day. 
Whether it be in the NBA like 
his brother, former Michigan 
standout Moe Wagner, or back 
overseas, Franz Wagner will be 
a professional basketball player.
So, why come to college in 
the states at all? Surely learning 
the American game as opposed 
to the European style played a 
role in the decision, but Wagner 
strongly asserts that becoming 
more well-rounded is a priority 
at this point in his life.
“I came here for a reason, and 
it’s not just to play basketball 
at this time,” Wagner said. “I 
really want to make the most 
of my time here. I don’t want to 
think too much about the future 
and stuff like that, I want to 
live in the now right now, and I 
think that’s the only way to get 
better, really. If you think too 
much about the future, it’s not 
gonna help you.”
