SPRING COMMENCEMENT

Afterbran r surgery,
year old leads healthy life

With Snyder as
speaker, officials
revert to previous
safety measures
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily StaffReporter
Though the class of 2011 will
not hear President Barack Obama
address them at next week's
Spring Commencement, they can
take solace in the fact that they
will not have to deal with Secret
Service imposed security mea-
sures.
The Commencement will
have several marked changes
from last year's momentous cer-
emony. Alterations to this year's
event - where Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder will deliver the key-
note speech - include changes
to security and increased efforts
promoting environmental sus-
tainability.
According to the University's
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Diane Brown,
security at the ceremony will be
the same as two years prior and
will not include the metal detec-
tors that visitors had to walk
through at last year's ceremony,

when Obama spoke to the gradu-
ating class.
"While there are the standard
lists of prohibited items for the
stadium because of the venue,
it'll be ... how we typically have
a commencement ceremony,"
Brown said. "Last year was the
anomaly, not the standard."
Last year, the Secret Service
dictated some of the security
requirements, including the clo-
sure of the parking lots on the
east side of Michigan Stadium,
according to Brown. ThWs year,
however, all the main arking
lots and walkways will be open to
students and guests, Brown said.
Additionally, since areas sur-
rounding the Big House are
public property, Brown said pro-
testors have the rightto protest or
demonstrate as long as they don't
cause a significant disturbance.
"People can be holding signs,
or handing out literature, or
whatever it is that they so choose
that they wantto do," Brown said.
After hearing that Snyder will
be giving the commencement
speech this year, some students
have said they will protest on
commencement day to demon-
strate their opposition to the gov-
ernor's proposed funding cuts to
Michigan's public universities

C.S. Mott makes
strides in tumor
diagnoses and
surgeries
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
Following a 1-hour surgery
at the University's C.S. Mott
Children's and Women's Hos-

pital, then-6-year-old patient
Samantha Provenzano set her
sights on one thing - getting
back to the playground.
After being diagnosed with
a benign brain tumor early last
spring, Samantha, now 7 years
old, underwent a successful sur-
gery at Mott to prevent future
cranial nerve damage.
Samantha's mother, Lee Ann
Provenzano, said a problem
with her daughter's hearing
indirectly led to the discovery

of the tumor. After taking a rou-
tine hearing test in kindergar-
ten, it was discovered that
Samantha had hearing loss in
one ear. After receiving the
news, Lee Ann and her husband
Bud sought a second opinion
at the University of Michigan
Health System.

'U' of Colorado ranks top party school

The University of Colo-
rado at Boulder took first
place in Playboy's 2011 party
school rankings that were
released last week, accord-
ing to an April 15 ABC News
article.
When creating the rank-
ings, Playboy looks at the
male to female ratio, the
percentage of winning
sports teams and how close
the schools are to beaches
and ski slopes, the article
states. Playboy also conducts
interviews with students
and alumni of the schools.
Last year's top party
school, The University of
Texas at Austin, slipped to

number five this year, ABC
news reported.
Penn State University
and Arizona State Universi-
ty took the second and third
spots, respectively, in this
year's ranking.
LA SALLE UNIVERSITY
TRIES TO CENSOR
SCHOOL NEWSPAPER
The Collegian, the stu-
dent newspaper at La Salle
University in Philadelphia,
left the area above the
fold blank in last Wednes-
day's paper, except for the
words "See below the Fold,"
according to an April 15

article in The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
The newspaper made the
decision after being granted
permission to run a story
about a professor having
exotic dancers come to an
off-campus business semi-
nar on the condition that it
run below the fold, the arti-
cle states.
The article about the
professor was written and
ready to run in the paper
on April 7, but the paper
was told it could not run the
story until the university
had completed its investi-
gation, according to The
Inquirer. After the students

at The Collegian argued
to run the story since mul-
tiple other news outlets had
already reported it, the dean
of students agreed to let the
story run, pending that the
university's lawyer read it
beforehand, The Inquirer
reported.
The story was originally
slated to be a front-page
feature article, according
to The Inquirer. But when
the students were told the
article had to run below the
fold, they moved the entire
section, includingthe news-
paper's masthead, below
the fold.

N. Carolina gets worst of
storms that ravaged U.S. I

Tornados killed
45 people across 6
states, destroying
homes and cars
ASKEWVILLE, N.C. (AP) -
A tornado-spewing storm sys-
tem that killed at least 45 people
acrosshalfthe countryunleashed
its worst fury on North Caro-
lina, where homes broke apart,
trees snapped and livestock were
swept into the air. Residents in
the capital city and rural ham-
lets alike mourned the dead,
marveled at their own survival
yesterday and began to clean up
devastated neighborhoods.
Observers reported more
than 60 tornadoes across North
Carolina on Saturday, but most
of the state's 21 confirmed deaths
occurred in two rural counties. A
thunderstorm spawned a tornado
that killed four people in south-
eastern Bladen County, then kept

dropping tornadoes as it hop-
scotched more than 150 miles,
eventually moving into Bertie
County and killingli more.
Heavy winds swept some
homes from their foundations,
demolished others and flipped
cars on tiny rural roads between
Askewville and Colerain, Bertie
County Manager Zee Lamb said.
At least three of those who died
were from the same family, he
said.
The winds ripped to shreds
the doublewide mobile home in
Askewville where Justin Dun-
low had sought shelter for his
3-year-old daughter, 5-year-old
son and himself. The 23-year-old
roofer, whose own mobile home
nearby also was destroyed, lay on
both children as the storm did its
worst.
"I just started praying, and the
wall fell on top of us and that's
what kept us there," he said. "I
can replace the house, butI can't
replace my babies. And that's
what I thought about. I'm alive.

My babies are alive."
In Bladen County, Milton
McKoy had thought his mobile
home in Ammon was out of the
storm's path before he saw a tor-
nado over the tops of pine trees,
lifting pigs and other animals
into the sky.
"It looked just like 'The Wiz-
ard of Oz,"' said his wife, Audrey.
The couple took shelter in the
laundry room as the tornado
snapped trees and carried off
several homes in the neighbor-
hood. When they stepped out, it
took them a moment to figure out
the twister had turned their own
home around, leavingthem inthe
backyard.
The violent weather began
Thursday in Oklahoma, where
two people died, before cutting
across the Deep South on Friday
and hitting North Carolina and
Virginia on Saturday. Authori-
ties said seven people died in
Arkansas; seven in Alabama;
seven in Virginia; and one in
Mississippi.

Police fire on demonstrators
in Iraq, at least 35 wounded

Seven shot, dozens
harmed by tear
gas and rocks in
northern city
SULAIMANIYAH, Iraq
(AP) - Iraqi police opened fire
yesterday on stone-throwing
crowds protesting government
corruption in Iraq's northern
Kurdish region. At least 35
people were wounded, some of
them by gunfire, a doctor said.
It was the latest protest to
turn violent in Sulaimaniyah,
a city in the normally peace-
ful Kurdish region where
demonstrations calling for
political and economic reforms
have been held nearly every day

over the last several months.
A day earlier, Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki lauded Iraq's
security forces as ready to protect
the country in a meetingwith U.S.
House Speaker John Boehner.
In Sulaimaniyah, located 160
miles (260 kilometers) north-
east of Baghdad, witnesses said
some police fired into the air to
clear protesters blocking a road
and others shot into the crowd.
Seven people were shot, includ-
ing two local journalists, said
Sulaimaniyah health director
Dr. Regald Hama Rasheed.
He said the other 28 people
were wounded by thrown rocks
or were hospitalized because
of breathing problems from the
tear gas.
No deaths were immediately
reported. At least nine protest-

ers have been killed in anti-
government demonstrations in
Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish
region since Feb. 17.
The demonstrations appear to
have taken inspiration from the
other flashes of unrest spreading
across the Middle East and North
Africa.
Meeting with Boehner on Sat-
urday night, al-Maliki repeated
his belief that U.S. forces will no
longer be needed to help Iraq's
shaky stability after the end of
the year.
"The Iraqi armed and secu-
rity forces are able to handle
the responsibility of maintain-
ing security, and work in a pro-
fessional way," al-Maliki told
Boehner, according to a state-
ment issued by the prime minis-
ter's office.

Corruption charge
is latest step to bring
old regime to justice
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's ex-
prime minister and two other
former Cabinet members were
charged with corruption yester-
day in the latest step in a cam-
paign to bring officials of Hosni
Mubarak's toppled regime to jus-
tice for years of corruption, rights
abuses and other crimes.
Egypt's attorney-general for
public funds charged former
Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif, ex-
Finance Minister Yousef Boutros
Ghali and former Interior Minis-
ter Habib el-Adly with wasting
more than $15 million in public
money and profiteering, the offi-
cial news agency reported.
Mubarak was forced to step
down on Feb. 11 after mas-
sive protests against his three
decades in power. One of the
protesters' chief complaints was
the corruption that pervades
the government, its bureaucracy

and virtually all levels of soci-
ety. Also driving the campaign to
bring the former president and
those connected to him to trial
are concerns that remnants of
the regime could maintain some
influence.
Mubarak and his sons were
placed in custody Wednesday for
15 days while they are investigat-
ed on corruption allegations and
over the deaths of hundreds of
protesters in the 18-day uprising.
The case involving his prime
minister and the two other ex-
Cabinet ministers centers on a
deal with a German business-
man. They are accused of grant-
ing him a contract to sell license
plates in Egypt without opening
up the deal to competitive bid-
ding. The German businessman
is also charged with corruption
in the case.
A trial date has not been set.
El-Adly, the ex-interior min-
ister, is already facing trial
on other corruption charges.
Egypt's protest movement also
wants to see him prosecuted
for rights abuses carried out by

the internal security forces that
were under his control.
Boutros Ghali, who is out-
side the country, is a nephew of
former U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
Nazif served as prime minis-
ter since 2004.
Mubarak has remained in a
hospital in the Red Sea resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh until he can
be transferred to a military hos-
pital. He was hospitalized with
unspecified heart problems on
Tuesday, the same day his ques-
tioning began.
A security official, speak-
ing on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to
speak to the media, said the delay
is primarily related to ensuring
his security.
The director of the hospital in
Sharm el-Sheikh, Mohamed Fad-
lallah, said Mubarak was in good
condition.
A witness who visited the hos-
pital said Mubarak had asked to
change the sealed windows in his
hospital suite for ones that open to
allow in fresh air.

Detroit Prayer

Thousands of people dedicated

The massive crowd filled
Woodward Avenue for the round-

The gathering easily surpassed

Health officials say porn pro-

In a report obtained by the

A train carrying Tunisian

at the French border yesterday in
an escalation of an international

African migrants fleeing political
unrest for refuge in Europe.
But France blamed what it said
were hundreds of activists on the
train planning a demonstration in
France, and posing a problem to
public order. Traffic was re-estab-
lished by evening - but not before
Italy lodged a formal protest.
"At no time was there a ... clos-
ing of the border between France
and Italy," French Interior Min-
istry spokesman Pierre-Henri
Brandet said. It was an "isolated
problem," he said by telephone,
"an undeclared demonstration."
He estimated that up to 10
trains may have been affected,
five on each side.

Sec. of State:
Despite disasters,
Japan will remain
a 'gobal player'
TOKYO (AP) - U.S. Secre-
tary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton said yesterday that
America would stand by Japan,
saying she was confident the
country will fully recover from
its tsunami and nuclear disas-
ters.
"We are very confident that
Japan will recover and will be a
very strong economic and glob-
al player for years and decades
to come," Clinton told Prime
Minister Naoto Kan during a
brief visit to Tokyo intended
as a morale boost to the crucial
U.S. ally.
Kan thanked Clinton for U.S.
help with the crises triggered
by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake
on March 11 that unleashed
a massive tsunami, wrecking
cooling and power systems at
a nuclear plant that has been
leaking radiation ever since.
"We will never forget and
we will keep in our memory
that the U.S. has provided such
robust support," said Kan, in
comments suggesting the aid
has helped soothe friction over
an American military base in
Okinawa that forced his pre-

decessor, Yukio Hatoyama, to
resign last year.
Relief operations mounted
by American soldiers after the
earthquake and tsunami helped
show a new and welcome face
for troops the Japanese have
hosted - sometimes grudgingly
- for decades.
Roughly 20,000 U.S. troops
were mobilized in "Operation
Tomodachi," or "Friend," the
biggest bilateral humanitarian
mission the U.S. has conducted
in Japan. The U.S. is also help-
ing Japan cope with its nuclear
crisis.
Kan has pledged to beef
up disaster preparedness and
make his top priority resolv-
ing the crisis at the tsunami-
wrecked Fukushima Dai-ichi
nuclear plant.
Tokyo Electric Power Co.,
the operator of the plant,
announced yesterday a plan to
bring the crisis under control
within six to nine months, aim-
ing to end radiation leaks that
have forced the evacuation of
tens of thousands of people.
"We would like to see evacu-
ees return to their homes as
early as possible," said TEPCO
Chairman Tsunehisa Katsu-
mata.
Clinton said Foreign Minis-
ter Takeaki Matsumoto, who
she met with earlier, told her
that Japan hoped for U.S. feed-
back on the plan.

"The constant efforts to
respond to the situation at
Fukushima have required
intense analysis by Japanese,
American and international
experts, and we have been very
supportive of what Japan is
doing to take the appropriate
steps," she said.
Clinton and Matsumoto
announced the formation of
a public-private partnership
to encourage investment in
the recovery effort. The aim is
to keep American businesses
interested in Japan by demon-
strating its ability to bounce
back from daunting natural
disasters.
"There has been a great
outpouring of concern, sym-
pathy and admiration for the
great resilience and spirit the
Japanese people have shown
throughout this very difficult
experience," Clinton said.
Clinton, who called Japan's
well-being a "bedrock prior-
ity," also met with the Japanese
emperor and empress. She was
due to return to the U.S. later
yesterday.
"I am so, so sorry for every-
thing your country is going
through. If there is anything we
can do ..." Clinton said to Emper-
or Akihito and Empress Michiko,
who have been visiting evacua-
tion centers near Tokyo and plan
visits to areas hardest hit by the
disasters in coming weeks.

Nigerian incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, second right, registers to vote in Otuoke, Nigeria on Saturday.
Nigerians chose their president in an election many hoped would show how Africa's most populous nation could hold a
credible vote without the violence and rigging that marred previous ones.

Jonathan wins
19.4M votes out of
31.1M count
ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -
Nigerian President Goodluck
Jonathan took a nearly insur-
mountable lead yesterday in
the election to lead the oil-rich
nation, though fragmented
returns suggested the Christian
incumbent faced strong opposi-
tion from the country's Muslim
north.
Meanwhile, authorities in the
vice president's northern Nige-
rian hometown said that eight
people had been wounded in a
bomb blast at a hotel in a poor
neighborhood hours after voters
cast their ballots in the other-
wise peaceful election.
Certified results from the
Independent National Electoral
Commission released from Sat-
urday's election showed Jona-
than had 19.4 million votes out

of a total of 31.1 million already
counted. His nearest opponent,
former military ruler Muham-
madu Buhari, held 8.7 million
votes.
Results from eight of Nigeria's
36 states have yet to be formally
announced in Abuja, the coun-
try's capital. While those states
have enough votes to seize the
lead from Jonathan, it appears
unlikely Buhari will be able to
salvage a victory.
Jonathan also had won
enough votes in those states
counted by yesterday night to
avoid triggering a runoff.
Attahiru Jega, chairman
of the national electoral body,
said his agency would begin
announcing results again at
9 a.m. today. Every television
network and most radio sta-
tions in Africa's most populous
nation aired the vote results live
to a country that has remained
in suspense since the mostly
peaceful vote held Saturday in a
land used to violence and thug-

gery at the polls.
Jonathan, who became presi-
dent after his predecessor died
in office last year, has long been
considered the front-runner as
his ruling People's Democratic
Party has dominated politics in
the West African giant since it
became a democracy 12 years
ago. However, the country's
Muslim north remains hesitant
about Jonathan as the Christian
from the south who took over
after the death of the country's
elected Muslim leader.
Many of the north's elite
wanted the ruling party to
honor an unwritten power-
sharing agreement calling for a
Muslim candidate to run in this
election, yet Jonathan prevailed
in the party's primary.
Buhari, the presidential
candidate of the Congress for
Progressive Change, won the
support of many in the north as
a Muslim leader willing to crack
down on the corruption preva-
lent in the nation.

Granting education
'U' should attract more low-income students
Diversity is one of the most prominent buzzwords that the Uni-
versity uses in its recruitment process. Efforts are constantly
made to more actively recruit underrepresented minorities
to the University and to improve retention and matriculation rates.
However, socioeconomic diversity is one type of diversity that tends
to be forgotten. Many students are unaware of the resources-available
that make higher education more financially viable and, with rising
tuition, they are priced out of education. The University is beginning
to advertise financial aid options, and this should continue in order to
effectively diversify the student body.

According to an April 14 Michigan Daily
article, the 50 universities with the largest
endowments - which includes the Univer-
sity of Michigan - fail to attract low-income
students and adequately meet their financial
needs. While the University has worked to
attract ethnic and racial minorities, the num-
ber of Pell Grant recipients who apply has
fallen in recent years. Pell Grants are feder-
ally subsidized grants for college tuition for
students whose family incomes are less than
$40,000 a year.
The 50 universities in the nation with the
biggest endowments each have a lower Pell
Grant-eligible student population than the
national average. The University's 12.8 per-
cent of Pell Grant recipients in the student
body, however, is even below the 50 univer-
sities' average of 15 percent. The University
cannot tout diversity as one of its main virtues
when this important demographic is under-
represented.
According to the same Daily article, the
Universityreceives relatively similar numbers
of ACT scores from low-income and high-
income applicants. However, among those
who send scores, more high-income applicants
later apply to the University. Many potential
applicants don't apply because they assume
they would pay full tuition, which wouldn't be
financially feasible. Obviously, the University
cannot force anyone to apply or enroll. How-

ever, it can make more of an effort to inform
low-income students of the financial aid thatis
available. Pell Grants, along with other schol-
arships and financial aid opportunities, must
be more clearly advertised.
Fortunately, University officials have
begun the process of improving efforts to
market the University better to low-income
students. The University has created a mar-
keting office within the Office of Under-
graduate Admissions to inform academically
qualified students that the University wants
to make it financially possible for them to
attend. This is an encouraging first step
toward increasing the number of low-income
students attending the University.
It's important that the admissions office
actually enacts these changes and increases
the number of low-income students at the
University. The new marketing office must
implement a concrete strategy if real change
is going to occur.
The University should continue its efforts
to advertise among low-income students start-
ing in middle school, so there is more incentive
to apply to the University. Higher education is
getting more and more expensive each year,
but it's crucial that qualified students can
always find a way to make a University educa-
tion financially viable. The University's efforts
to advertise these opportunities are a positive
step toward making that goal a reality.

I was about 10 VAN GILDER
years old when
my Girl Scout
troop took a trip here to the Univer-
sity. My troop was from the small
Catholic elementary school that I
attended. Everyone's favorite Uni-

Nolta went to the church that our
Catholic school was attached to. She
generously offered to teach my Girl
Scout troop a little chemistry so we
could earn some badge or another.
So the eight or nine of us girls piled
into a few minivans with our troop
leaders and headed to Ann Arbor.
We spent the afternoon tie-dying

Congress needs 'factual' debates

a

In the wake of the recent supposed "government
shutdown," many of the frustrating disagreements
between Democrat and Republican Senators centered
around federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Not
to say that abortion isn't a controversial issue and
shouldn't be discussed by our nation's leaders, but
to risk government failure over a small issue such as
funding a non-profit organization is unacceptable.
What is perhaps the most controversial aspect of
this entire story isn't the debate itself or the outcome
of the budgetary issue, but one speech made during the
debate about Planned Parenthood that was made by
Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.). While on the floor of the Senate
he said, "If you want an abortion, you go to Planned
Parenthood..." Ok, fair enough. Many women may go to
Planned Parenthood to make one of the most difficult
decisions in their life and in fact have an abortion. But
then Kyl goes on to say abortions are "...well over 90
percent of what Planned Parenthood does."
WHAT?!
When I saw this statement, my first reaction was
hysterical. Not hysterically funny, but absolutely out-
raged that a three-term United States Senator, who
prides himself (accordingto his website) on knowledge
of the nuances of policy, could say such a thing. I may
be less critical of Kyl if his factual error was merely out
of negligence or even stupidity.
However, his error wasn't motivated by ignorance,
but a complete unwillingness to be truthful. Ninety
percent is far from the actual number - 3 percent. Was
he rounding to the nearest 90 percent? What is he pay-
ing his staff for if he can't get even a ballpark number?
In light of his words, Kyl's office issued a statement,
"his remark was not intended to be a factual statement,
but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an
organization that receives millions of dollars in tax-
payer funding, does subsidize abortions."
Not intended to be factual! You got me! I should
have known statements made on the Senate floor, that
will be entered into the Congressional record, aren't
intended to be factual. So soldier deaths in Afghani-
stan - not factual. BP's oil spill - not factual. Govern-

ment debt, you guessed it - not factual. Whew! Thank
god, because I was getting worried about those.
Senator, I understand thatyou oppose federally sub-
sidized abortions, and I'm sure that Americans would
agree with you. But why lie about the facts? Or, more
specifically, why intend not to be factual? Can you not
construct a compelling argument to support your posi-
tion without making up facts? If your position is the
bestinyour opinion, then there oughtto be a legitimate
reason - not a made up one - to support it, right?
It is this type of rhetoric in contemporary American
politics that helps polarize and destruct our already
deranged party system. Why do Republicans and Dem-
ocrats hate each other so much? It's not because they
disagree on so many issues. In fact, they agree on most.
But political lies, such as exaggerated statistics and
name calling (Tea Party = Tea Baggers), only detract
from the intended purpose of the true democratic pro-
cess.
We need to create policy decisions based on the
actual and not the-made up world. I'm a firm believ-
er that most people (and politicians) can make good
decisions, but when facts are skewed and parties are
demonized, any chance that reasonable decisions will
be made is futile. Willingness to work with the other
party, or even compromise on issues, becomes impos-
sible and can (almost) lead to a government shutdown.
Maybe it's just my radically Muslim agenda, but I
think we can fix this problem. We need to elect rep-
resentatives who are willing to cope with reality and
have genuine discussions about policies. This is not to
be confused with politicians who pointlessly debate
and then whine filibuster when they don't get their
way. A senator can, and should, represent his state
genuinely and honestly while being able to admit that a
compromise is best for the country.
There is a long road ahead of us if we wish to correct
this problem, but at least Kyl is voluntarily taking the
first step and will retire from the Senate at the begin-
ning of next year.

the commissioners attempt to

he knows the deficit will mean

the board must look into making
effective modifications and cost

"I see it as making our gov-

to make it run more efficiently

Rabhi said. "But of course
you can't find $20.9 million of

In addition to working on bal-

He added that he is planning to

Despite the differences in

change on this year's agenda is to
make the ceremony more envi-

hundreds of thousands of pages
overall.
In addition, the University has
eliminated hot dogs from conces-

At this point in her daughter's
prognosis, Lee Ann said her mind
was working at "100 miles an
hour."
"I was wondering if (the diag-
nosis) was a mistake ... or possibly
life threatening," she said.
In the weeks preceding
Samantha's surgery with Cormac
Maher, a pediatric neurosurgeon
at UMHS, Lee Ann said Saman-
tha was surprisingly courageous
despite her parents' anxiety.

students from his class to help
the University develop green
initiatives at commencement by
evaluating previous practices and
developing changes.
"(The students are) not just
looking at this year, they're look-
ing at long term, how (to) ... make
commencement a zero-waste
event," Shriberg said. "So they've
got some bigger ideas in terms of
increasing the amount of com-
posting, increasing recycling and
reducing materials that go in."
While some students were
involved in making the ceremony
more environmentally sustain-
able, LSA senior Jillian Rothman
will be partaking in a different
way. Rothman was selected to
be the student speaker at com-
mencement, after her speech was
reviewed by a group of faculty,
students and alumni.
"She knew she was goingto the
hospital, she knew she was going
to get stitches and she knew she
was going to get as many popsi-
cles as she wanted," Lee Ann said.
"She was excited to show off her
scar."
Lee Ann recalled that the sur-
gery yielded a quick recovery.
After a four-day stay at Mott, Lee
Ann said her daughter returned
to school three weeks later and
resumed her day-to-day activi-
ties.
According to Lee Ann, her
daughter's resilience has allowed
her to transition back to a mostly
normal life. Having dealt primari-
ly with child patients, Lesperance
said children are especially adept
at coping with illness.

"I think I've had a very typical
experience here," Rothman said.
"I love Michigan a lot, and I guess
I have a lot to sayabouthow much
I love it, and I hope it represents
what most people graduating
feel."
Rothman said she recognizes
that some students are disap-
pointed with the choice of Snyder
as the commencement speaker.
However, she said she encour-
ages students to put aside their
political beliefs and appreciate
his accomplishments as a Univer-
sity alum.
"Whether or not you agree
with what he's doing with those
degrees, the fact is he's taken his
degrees and used them to con-
tinue his fight for something he
believes in," Rothman said. "We
should all be so lucky to be able to
do that with our degrees."
"They want to be healthy. They
want to go play," she said. "They
really bounce back."
Though Lesperance will con-
tinue seeing Samantha periodi-
cally over the next few years, Lee
Ann said Samantha's health is sta-
ble. She added that, more impor-
tantly, her daughter's spirits are
high.
"I'm just so happy that even
with her hearing loss, it hasn't
affected her self-confidence," Lee
Ann said. "She's just an all-Amer-
ican kid."
Samantha has even turned her
hearing problem into a fashion
statement, her mother said.
"She has very cool, groovy,
bright blue hearing aids," Lee
Ann said,

ORDER
From Page 1A
Order announced the names
of the 22 students who make up
the class of 2012 ina press release
issued Friday. As in recent years,
the organization's newest class
includes leaders from a variety of
campus organizations, including
athletic teams, service organiza-
tions and religious and ethnic
groups.
A maximum of 25 seniors are
selected, or "tapped," for mem-
bership each year by the outgoing
members to carry on the mission
of the organization.
According to a document pro-
vided by the group, Order aims to
"advance exceptional leadership
through a lifelong loyalty to and
engagement with the University
of Michigan."
The document outlined that the
group does this by workingtoward
its six core goals - bringing suc-
cessful and diverse leaders togeth-
er through membership in Order,
"creating a forum of purpose" in
which constructive dialogue can
occur, "facilitating campus syner-
gy" tobringaboutpositive change,
increasing the influence of lead-
ers on campus by better inform-
ing them about issues on campus,
building lifelong connections to
the University, to the University
and to "reflect and engage" on the
University's "values, spirit and
aspirations."
The organization has come
under fire in the past for using
Native American artifacts as part
of its operations. But in 1989, then-
Michigamua signed an agreement
in which it agreed, according to
the organization's press release, to
"eliminate all references to Native
American culture ... with one
exception being the name Mich-
igamua."''
However, in 2000, members of
the Students of Color Coalition
entered the seventh floor of the
Michigan Union tower - a space
indefinitely leased to the senior
honor society - and discovered
what it alleged were Native Amer-
ican artifacts. Members of the
Students of Color Coalition said
the discovery violated the 1989
agreement.
In documents given to the Daily
by Order, the organization reaf-
firmed its position that no such
discovery of Native American
artifacts ever occurred.
"There was never an indepen-
dent review of the break in," the
document from Order states. "Any
claim by the protestors that cul-
tural objects were in view or in use
are all 'alleged' or 'claims.'"
The 2000 incident, as well as

the group's non-disclosure of its
membership in some years, have
cast criticism on the group for
being secretive.
However, Order spokesman
James Stinson III, an LSA senior,
wrote in an e-mail interview that
the idea that the group is "less
transparent than other groups" is
a misconception.
"We have continuously offered
and will continue to offer to speak
to any individual or group that
would like to learn more about us
or our members," Stinson wrote.
Asked about the allegations
made by the Students of Color
Coalition in 2000, Stinson wrote
that Order of Angell has made
attempts to improve its relation-
ship with groups they may have
offended in the past.
"Order has done a great deal to
mend relationships with individu-
als and groups that care enough
to listen and share with us," he
wrote. "Unfortunately, there are
a small number of organizations
that continue to use us as a politi-
cal tool."
He added: "They are blatantly
discriminatory, block members of
their own communities from hav-
ing the freedom to choose their
affiliations and hide behind accu-
sations of hate instead of engaging
in real discourse."
Though Order says it often
works behind the scenes as it
does not seek recognition for its
efforts, the group took a pub-
lic stance last year in defense of
then-Michigan Student Assem-
bly President Chris Armstrong;
who is a member of Order's 2011
class. As part of it's support of
Armstrong, Stinson and fellow
Order member Alexander Wood,
an LSA senior, wrote a viewpoint
in the Daily. The viewpoint criti-
cized Andrew Shirvell, a former
Michigan assistant attorney gen-
eral, for his actions against Arm-
strong and his characterization of
order.
"Using Order of Angell as a
scapegoatcand shroud for discrimi-
nation only circumvents confront-
ing actual issues,"the two wrote at
the time in their viewpoint.
In his e-mail interview last
weekend, Stinson urged those
who may still have concerns about
the group's image to be open to
a two-way discussion with the
group.
"The only path to healing is to
open the doors, not to shun truth
or simple human dignity and
courtesy," Stinson wrote. "Our
door is open to those who are will-
ing to listen and reflect."
- Because of her membership in
the group, Editor in Chief Stephanie
Steinberg did not edit this story.

K-GRAMS
From Page 1A
from the University and local
elementary schools through pro-
grams like Pen Pals and Book-
MARK, a mentoring and reading
program.
Members of more than 60
student groups also came to
the event to entertain the kids
and host activities for the fair.
Activities varied from an inter-
active Jeopardy-inspired game
with health and nutritional facts
to an "Instrument Petting Zoo,"
which was created by the Michi-
gan Marching Band to give kids
an opportunity to play different

musical instruments.
Engineering junior Paul Dar-
nell and LSA and Art & Design
sophomore Ian Matchett, mem-
bers of the student organization
College Socialists, set up an art
station with stencils for the kids
to paint with.
"They were really engaged,
and actually, we had to keep tell-
ing them to not to paint in the
lines," Darnell said.
Matchett said the fair was a
chance for other student orga-
nizations on campus to get
involved and interact with the
kids - something many groups
don't have the opportunity to do.
"It's like giving back to a com-
munity that we should be a part

of," Matchett said.
Ellen Gorbaty, a teacher from
Holmes Elementary School in
Ypsilanti, said the games and
crafts created a perfect interac-
tive environment for the kids.
"Our kids don't get to do this.
If they're not in school, they're
attached to a video game or an
Xbox or any electronic stuff,"
Gorbaty said.
For LSA senior Liz Bronson,
who collects letters from the res-
idence halls and delivers them to
elementary schools as one of the
K-Grams Hall Heads, one of the
most meaningful aspects of the
K-grams Pen Pals program and
the Kids Fair is the exposure to
college life the elementary stu-

dents get by writing and talking
to their pen pals and being on
campus.
"I think it's really great
because it gives the elementary
school kids a real taste of what
college is like and they get to
come to the campus and they get
so excited to actually see college
kids," Bronson said. "They saw
a football player outside, and it
was like a celebrity sighting."
Gorbaty's class was chosen
this year to be the K-day class out
of all the participating schools.
Her students had an opportunity
to spend a day on campus and
experience the University's cam-
pus life by sitting in on a chem-
istry class, eating a meal in the

residence halls and exploringthe
University of Michigan Museum
of Art. Gorbaty, who has been
involved with K-grams for eight
years, said all the programs and
the Kids Fair have been benefi-
cial experiences for her students.
"All of the activities that they
do are just building bridges and
building avenues for our kids,"
she said.
LSA freshman Claire Talbert
said she enjoyed spending time
with her pen pal, who she met
for the first time at Friday's
event.
"It was just nice to see her in
person and to actually get to talk
to her and not have to wait until
another letter came," she said.

Talbert described the letter
exchange with her pen pal as a
fun way to connect with an ele-
mentary school student.
"It's a really nice way to talk to
younger students and tell them
about things that they can do
at school and get them excited
about things that you like -like
finding someone who's as inter-
ested in reading books as you are
or learning about riding horses,"
she said.
Gorbaty said she was excit-
ed to see the first encounters
between the pen pals.
"I don't know who smiled
more - my pen pal kids or the
college students. They were
equally excited," she said.

'Lost' in retrospect

MiND over matter

it' been 330 days since
"Lost" ended. Three hun-
dred and thirty days since
Jack shut his right eyelid, roll-
ing the closing credits on the
six-year
odyssey that
was at once
invigorating,
irritating,
heart-wrench-
ing and
hilarious. To
say I merely
miss the KAVI
show would SHEKHAR
be a vile PANDEY
understate-
ment - life
without "Lost" feels incomplete,
like Rose without Bernard, Sayid
without his badassery and Rich-
ard Alpert without his eyeliner.
Truthfully, I didn't always
feel this nostalgic about "Lost."
When the show was nearing its
conclusion, it was clear that two
camps were forming among its
viewers: those who were infuri-
ated by the show's resolutions
of several series-long myster-
ies, and those who accepted the
answers with content - and I
was firmly footed in the former.
Throughout its run, I was as
devoted a "Lost" fan as one could
be, but my adoration began to
crumble after the series's ante-
penultimate episode, "Across
the Sea." It was supposed to be
the tell-all, a revelatory hour
that would give light to the most
burning of mysteries, including
the origins of Jacob, the time
travel-inducing frozen wheel
doo-hickey and the pillar of
smoke endearingly dubbed the
"Smoke Monster."
The explanations came, but
they were as disappointing as
getting a can of Dharma Initia-
tive-branded garbanzo beans
for your birthday - everything
was chalked up as "the island
has magical properties," and
that was the end of that. I felt
cheated and betrayed, shot in the
chest by Michael Dawson while
I was getting blankets for my
hot date with Hurley. The grand
" riddles of "Lost" were not riddles
at all, just lazy storytelling by
some bum writers who had been
pulling our tails for the past six

years. It was disillusionment
more than anger, the sadness
you get as a kid when the myth
of Santa Claus is discovered. The
incredible twists and turns of the
"Lost" narrative had seemed too
good to be true, and they were.
But now I've had 330 days
to reflect upon "Lost" and its
legacy, and the question beckons
- was it really ever about the
mysteries?
At the end of his seven-book
series, "The Dark Tower," which
was released over a period of 22
years and sprawled over thou-
sands of pages, Stephen King
knew his readers would be furi-
ous about the conclusion (they
were) so he wrote a note arguing
that it wasn't the destination
that mattered, but the journey.
And the journey of "Lost" was
glorious.
It doesn't matter whether
the Smoke Monster came from
magic, nanotechnology or Leslie
Arzt's charred remains - the
creature scared the living beje-
sus out of the show's plane-crash
survivors, forcing them to band
together and eventually expos-
ing some of the most marvelous
character developments and
relationships in modern fiction.
Benjamin Linus grew from
murderous Machiavellian to
tragic figure yearning for mean-
ing and redemption (see his
tearful breakdown in season
six's "Dr. Linus"). Desmond and
Penny's legendary love story
transcended notions of time
and space (the phone call from
season four's "The Constant").
And Sawyer matured from a
semi-racist rascal to an adorable
romantic and courageous leader
(remember the look on his face
when he came home to Juliet in
season five's "LaFleur"?)
I began to realize how impor-
tant the show had been to my life.
The ritual of watching "Lost"
kept me tight with my family dur-
ing high school - a time when I
was constantly occupied with AP
classes, extracurricular activi-
ties (read: resume padders) and
thinking about colleges. Every
night "Lost" was on, though, my
family and I would drop every-
thing, don our blankets (it gets
cold in the U.P.) and watch "Lost"

with a bowl of strawberries my
dad had cut up for us.
Later, as I made the transi-
tion to college, "Lost" was my
constant. Placed in the frozen
tundra of Baits I, I made my best
friends from freshman year by
watching "Lost," during bonding
nights that featured Dum Dums
and interjections from the awe-
some kid from Singapore who
lived across the hall.
The show's philosophical con-
cepts have also deeply resonated
with me. "Lost" taught me to
"live together, die alone," so now
I try to live with the idea that
it's more important to put the
needs of friends, family and the
community over the needs of the
self. I was also struck early on
by John Locke's iconic mantra,
"everything happens for a rea-
son," which I've used to mentally
power myself through difficult
circumstances.
We have to
go back!
To bring everything full circle,
I've realized how similar Iam to
the protagonist of "Lost," Jack
Shephard (not that I'm compar-
ing myself to Matthew Fox, as
that would be ridiculous - I'm
clearly much more attractive).
The most significant development
in "Lost" was following Jack's
transformation from a man of
science to a man of faith, much
like I grew from a kid obsessed
with believable logic and reason
behind the mysteries of "Lost" to
one who understood the grander
goals the show accomplished.
It's impossible for me to end
this reminiscence with due sig-
nificance. So instead, I'm going
to hand it over to the lyrics of
the awesome YouTube video
"I'll Never Be Lost Again:" "It's
just a show, but feels like losing
a friend / Life goes on, but I'll
never be 'Lost' again."
See you in another life, brotha.
Pandey is hopelessly lost.

New ensemble
makes music with
neurofeedback
By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Arts Writer
Subaram Raman replaced a
singer with a singer's brain. A
hushed audience watched as he
played Ave Maria on the oboe by
French composer Charles Gou-
nod. Except, he wasn't playing.
The music was coming from a
computer, translating data from
his mind.
Raman, a doctoral student in
musical composition, is one mem-
ber of the MiND Ensemble (Music
in Neural Dimensions), a per-
formance group specializing in
advanced neurofeedback technol-
ogy. In the premiere performance
at the Duderstadt Center this past
weekend, Raman asked the audi-
ence, "What happens when our
musical freedom is limited only
by our ability to think?"
Using what's known as a "brain
hat," neurofeedback technology
monitors one's emotional state
by reading electroencephalogra-
phy (EEG) levels in the brain. By
appropriating this technology, the
MiND Ensemble has managed
to channel EEG data into sound.
In other words, they've created
music with their thoughts.
Ensemble member Robert
Alexander II, a doctoral student
in the Design Science Program,
was initially inspired from a TED
talk by Tan Le, founder of Emotiv.
The Australian company works
with interface technology, which
serves as a basis for the MiND
Ensemble's research.
"I immediately began tests to
see how this technology could be
used for expressive purposes,"
Alexander said.

The interface wasn't originally
intended for musical purposes,
but with collaboration with fellow
Ensemble members and generous
support from the University, Alex-
ander found a way to turn EEG
data into a new kind of instru-
ment, one that flows directly from
the mind to the music itself.
In a historical context, the
MiND Ensemble imitates a long
tradition of musical advancement
by getting at the heart of what it
means to make music: The sound
created is the outward manifesta-
tion of pure thought.
"We've made the process of
going from an idea of composition
to the actual sounds extremely
quick and direct," Alexander said.
"You're just a few clicks away
from being able to experiment."
With knowledge of neurofeed-
back technology's use for music,
additional applications have
been considered, like psychologi-
cal therapy, Alexander said. By
examining what brain states look
and sound like, musical feedback
can be used as a form of thera-
peutic treatment.
Despite innovative methods,
the Ensemble presents itself as a
synthesis between old and new.
According to Raman, the act of
creating music is as old as human-
kind - all that has changed are
the mediums for expression.
"We're able to play acoustic
instruments together with our
brain instruments," said David
Biedenbender, Ensemble member
and doctoral candidate in musical
composition. "It's a very new way
of shapingthe creative process."
The Ensemble's premiere
reflected the differing states
of active and passive thought,
flowing fluidly from live music
and monologues to meditative
pieces where the performer's
level of excitement could liter-
ally be heard in the room. Alex-

ander referred to the structure
as equal parts "musical jam ses-
sions" combined with explana-
tions about the technology. And,
because each piece taps into dif-
ferent emotions, it will never be
the same show twice.
"I can't predict what the emo-
tional experience is going to be,"
Raman said. "I can't predict what
my brain is going to do on a given
night."
Yet more than showcasing
technology, the Ensemble aims
to welcome people into a perfor-
mance of the mind in the most
human sense possible. From
direct dialogue to audience par-
ticipation, attendees were given a
number of scenarios meant to rep-
licate the ways in which we create
music on a daily basis, and how
these moments affect emotion
when it comes to making sound
with our brains.
"Everything that we do has an
accompanying sound," Alexander
said. "We're just taking thoughts
and turning them into sounds.
This is something we do all the
time."
For the MiND Ensemble, its
work is only in the beginning
phase. The software for musi-
cal brain interface, developed by
Alexander himself, is still in early
stages of development. But the
ensemble's members are confi-
dent in the technology's ability to
take its place in history as one of
the many evolutions of music.
The performance concluded
with a musical number by the
entire MiND Ensemble. One by
one, each member stood up, left
his or her instrument behind
and walked downstage until
they formed a line. Everyone
sat in silence as the musicians
performed, just by thinking the
music.
"We're stepping into a new era
in a symbolic sense," Raman said.

Cinematic sizzle for the summer months

0

MAY JUNE

JULY

AUGUST

40

The operative word this month is "sequel." Some-
times the word "sequel" can conjure up images of
dumb movies that can't let go of old jokes and rest
as nothing more than vain attempts by money-
grubbing producers to draw out the franchises until
they reach joke status and die a slow, disappointing
death at the box office. Let's hope this isn't the case
with May's two big-name flicks - both sequels -
which are slated to hit the big screen at the end of
the month. "Pirates of the Caribbean: Just Can't Let
This Go" - sorry, "On Stranger Tides" - will debut
at the end of the month before "The Hangover Part
II" does (good idea, producers), and features actors
we've already seen stuck in some kind of deji-vu
world where nothing original has happened since
the first film.
On the flipside, "The Hangover Part II," which
releases the following weekend, is a film that has
audiences all over America unable to shut up about
how excited they are to see it.
It should be freaking hilarious if the writers make
sure to include a new set of jokes and more all-too-
quotable lines like they did in the original "Hang-
over." Regardless, "Part II" will be funny because
the whole gang is in Thailand - Stu's getting mar-
ried - with Zach Galifianakis still acting dumb and
the ever-sexy Bradley Cooper being his usual smol-
dering self.
-MACKENZIE METER

June is typically filled with franchise pictures,
even if not so heavily as its bordering months. This
year, the month will start on June 3 with the fifth
installment of the X-Men franchise, "X-Men: First
Class." Fox doesn't seem happy to just keep giving
these mutants sequels to play around in, and have
opted to instead go backward, sideways and every
direction except forward. And it actually gives them
exciting opportunities. Check this prequel out for
some pre-superhero mutant action.
On June 10, J.J. Abrams will unveil his third
directorial release, "Super 8" - the first he's been
able to write and direct on his own. It's essentially
about some kids who filma freak train wreck with a
Super 8 camera. In case you don't know J.J. Abrams
... weird shit ensues.
The following week will be led by "Green Lan-
tern," the DC Comics adaptation with Ryan Reyn-
olds playing the ringbearer himself ... in 3-D! Other
releases include R-rated comedy "Bad Teacher,"
which features Jason Segel as a gym teacher and
Cameron Diaz as a schoolteacher raising money to
get breast implants to win over Justin Timberlake.
Even if it sucks, the situation sounds like a win-win-
win. The month finishes off on June 24 with "Cars
2" - Disney's attempt to convert its huge off-screen
franchise success back into on-screen entertain-
ment. Pixar still rocks, so check it out.
-ANKUR SOHONI

July brings further evidence that the Hollywood
well is running dry. The month will see the epon-
ymous silver screen adaptation of '80s television
series "The Smurfs," with the CGI-ed little blue gang
romping around the Big Apple with Neil Patrick
Harris. Also getting the big-screen treatment is the
100-Acre Wood crew in Disney's "Winnie the Pooh."
And, it wouldn't be summer without Michael
Bay, whose "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" faces
stiff competition for cream of the blockbuster crop
against the Daniel Craig-, Harrison Ford- and Olivia
Wilde-billed sci-fi western "Cowboys and Aliens."
A handful of rom-coms will poke into the high-
octane fray: Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake star
in "Friends with Benefits," a flick about friends
with, uh, benefits, and heavy hitters Julia Rob-
erts and Tom Hanks strike a schoolboy romance
(literally - Hanks returns to college and Roberts
is his teacher) in "Larry Crowne." But it's the odd
couple of Ryan Gosling as Steve Carell's marriage
counselor in "Crazy, Stupid, Love" that seems most
enticing.
There's also a dose of cerebral cinema: In sci-fi
love story "Another Earth," a duplicate planet is
found in the solar system. And lest we forget, the
saga of the world's favorite teenage wizard comes to
an end in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:
Part 2." Magic nerds rejoice!
-STEPHEN OSTROWSKI

This August promises the typical combination
of critically acclaimed summer films and those that
wouldn't have a chance in hell of making back their
budgets in any other season. "Conan the Barbarian,"
a remake of the famed Schwarzenegger movie, will
hit theaters on the 19th. It's directed by a guy whose
biggest credits are remakes of "Friday the 13th" and
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." There's also anoth-
er remake of "Planet of the Apes," since Tim Burton
messed up the last one, and a new "Spy Kids" movie.
Of the remakes and sequels, "Apes" seems tolera-
ble because of its cast, which includes recently Oscar-
nominated James Franco ("127 Hours") and veterans
Brian Cox ("The Bourne Identity") and John Lith-
gow ("Terms of Endearment"). Then again, the Bur-
ton remake also featured now-Oscar-nominee Mark
Wahlberg ("The Departed") and veterans Tim Roth
("Reservoir Dogs") and Paul Giamatti ("Win Win").
Odds are that Charlton Heston's version will still be
the version we're renting 20 years from now.
August's one promising movie, "30 Minutes or
Less," reunites another recent Oscar nominee, Jesse
Eisenberg, with Ruben Fleischer, his director in the
acclaimed comedy "Zombieland." Eisenberg stars
as a hapless pizza delivery guy coerced by criminals
into robbing a bank, and though we haven't seen any
preview material, having Fleischer behind the cam-
era is a good sign for any feature.

she might be

stereotypes
on "Jersey Shore"). Among the
films she showed of Italian-
Americans contributing to art,
culture and politics in the Unit-
ed States was one about Filippo
Mazzei, an influential Italian
philosopher in America during
the nation's founding.
Mazzei is the subject of Man-
ganello's humorous one-man
Basement Arts show "Zealous
Whig: Filippo Mazzei in Early
America," which opens Thursday.
Caught between deep rever-
ence for Mazzei's contributions
and mockery inspired by images
from the high school film of the
Italian theorist dictating the
Declaration of Independence to
Thomas Jefferson, Manganello's
show walks the line between
historical fiction and giddy
whimsy. In the play's YouTube
trailer, Manganello, dressed in
period costume, poses in various
dignified positions while grandi-
ose music plays. At the end of the
trailer, Manganello struggles to
tuck his shirt into this pants, and
then finally bursts into laughter.
"Paul's kind of a clown,
but he also really appreciates

both of those things are going to

LSA senior Paul Manganello went to parties dressed as Filippo Mazzei.

show through," said Music, The-
atre & Dance sophomore Neal
Kelley, who works as a consul-
tant to evaluate things Mangan-
ello cannot see for himself while
onstage. "('Zealous Whig') is not
just one guy giving a lecture. It's
this goofy, short, little Italian
guy running around the stage
and teaching about this other
Italian guy's life."
For Manganello, who is one-
quarter Italian, "Zealous Whig"
has been in the works for years.
In fall 2009, when his uncle
offered to take him and his
brother Jim on a trip to Monti-
cello, Jefferson's home in Vir-
ginia, they both jumped at the
chance. Sure enough, Mangan-
ello's thoughts circled back to
that mysterious colonial char-
acter from Italian class - "the
genius behind Jefferson," as he
half-jokingly calls Mazzei.
"I told Jim, 'Wouldn't it be
funny if I dressed up as Filippo
Mazzei, spoke like an Italian to
locals and you filmed it?' " Man-
ganello said. "And he said, 'Yeah,
let's do it.' So we did."
Manganello wore his period
costume in the streets of histori-
cal Virginia, including the site of
Mazzei's home - though he later
acquiesced to his uncle's request
that he explore Monticello in
regular clothing. The final step
of the experiment was to crash
- and get kicked out of - three
fraternity parties at the Univer-
sity of Virginia in full costume
I

and film the response.
"In the end, Mazzei's story
was a lot like my first trip to
Monticello," said Manganello,
who did an independent study
this year on Mazzei's writing on
colonial politics, bringing some
historical rigor to the play. "It's
the story of this guy who showed
up in America, tried to get into
the ultimate Virginia frat house
- Congress - and then was
kicked out."
Historically, the Found-
ing Fathers were resistant to
Mazzei's interpretation of
Enlightenment ideals, specifi-
cally his "Italian" concept of
equality. In a moment of clever
anachronism in the play, Mazzei
theorizes, in a thick Italian
accent, how an adoption of "Ital-
ian" rather than "American"
equality might play out in, say, a
21st century debate about health
care legislation.
Manganello, a philosophy and
Italian language and culture
major, is also a stand-up come-
dian who has been featured in
local venues. He sees this show
as the culmination of all his
interests: Italian, political theo-
ry, comedy and theater.
"It's an excuse for me to be
an Italian comedian," Mangan-
ello said. "An American come-
dian laughs at the world, where
the Italian comedian is more
inclined to play the clown. He
reflects the absurdity of the
world that is laughing at him."

the big screen are the people
who've been fired. Where do they
go the next day? What do they
do? How do they cope? Those are
the questionsthat "The Company
Men" tries to answer, following
victims of the recent financial
crisis as they attempt to move on
with their lives.
Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck,
"The Town") was a middle-aged,
upper-middle-class account
manager at conglomerate GTX.
He was living the American
dream: big house, nice family
and a Porsche in the driveway.
And then one day, after years of
service, he's suddenly dismissed
as a redundancy and forced out
of his office. He's quickly joined
by Phil Woodward (Chris Coo-
per, "Syriana") an older, upper-
level executive who's struggling
to put two kids through college.
The cutbacks are part of a
strategic initiative fromthe head
of GTX, James Salinger (Craig T.
Nelson, "The Devil's Advocate")
to keep his company out of bank-
ruptcy and avoid a hostile take-
over. When his partner, Gene
McLary (Tommy Lee Jones, "No

these moves as Pyrrhic, he soon
finds himself on the scrap heap
as well.

Mike Hart stood on the sideline at
Michigan Stadiumwith his arms folded
across his chest, waiting for the Michi-
gan football team to emerge from the
tunnel.
More importantly, Hart was wait-
ing for the reemergence of the style of
running he thrived under as a Wolver-
ine. Hart left Michigan in 2007 as the
program's all-time leading rusher, with
5,040 yards at Michigan - no running
back has come close to that mark since.
And when Hart left Michigan, so did
the program's power running game.
Out went Lloyd Carr, in came Rich
Rodriguez and the spread offense.
At the spring game on Saturday, with
Michigan coach Brady Hoke now at the
helm, the Wolverines found that style

once again. But it's certainly not per-
fected.
Michigan running backs coach
Fred Jackson called the performance
"inconsistent."
"A lot of things they've got to get bet-
ter at - in terms of just running, lever-
age runs, things that they did in terms
of blocking, we were late on our reads,"
Jackson said. "Just inconsistent."
Jackson, who coached a big-bodied,
physical running game for 16 years
before Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez
shifted to a spread offense, saw a flash
of that old Michigan magic when red-
shirt junior running back Mike Cox
took the field.

On the one that counted, sophomore

Botterman caps off sensational season, wins All-Around title

By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
At the beginning of the sea-
son, one name was associated
with Michigan women's gym-
nastics. By the end of the season,
that same name has become syn-
onymous with NCAA women's
gymnastics.That name is Kylee
Botterman.
Botterman, Michigan's cap-
tain and All-Around sensation,
completed her senior season
with the highest accolades that
can be awarded to an NCAA
athlete. Among her individu-
al achievements, Botterman

has been named the Big Ten
Gymnast of the Year, NCAA
All-Around Champion and the
2011 AAI Award winner for
the top gymnast in the NCAA.
She is also the front-runner for
the prestigious Honda Award,
decided on April 22nd.
With all the individual atten-
tion, Botterman attributes her
success to one thing - confi-
dence.
"I don't think I'm the most
talented gymnast in the coun-
try," Botterman said. "But I am
confident. I believe in what I'm
going to do before I get on the
apparatus, and that's something

most people struggle with. I
really value self-confidence
and the mental aspects of gym-
nastics and I think my mental
strength has led to a successful
career."
In the moments leading up
to her final team competition,
while she was dancing through
her floor routine, Botterman
was almost moved to tears.
"In the middle of my routine
I almost started to cry," Botter-
man said. "I was like, 'This is
my last competition.' And while
all the girls were lined up along
the side I started to say, 'I love
gymnastics guys, I just love it,'

and they all just started making
fun of me. It was kind of a cheese
ball thing to do, but I'm really
goingto miss these moments."
After the Wolverines finished
last at the NCAA Super Six this
past weekend, Michigan coach
Bev Plocki could do nothing but
smile when commenting on Bot-
terman and her career in Ann
Arbor.
"(Botterman) has been the
heart and soul of our program,"
Plocki said. "This season was an
unbelievable season for her. She
missed one routine the entire
year, which is unheard of ... To

SPORT MONDAY COLUMN p
Afinal goodbye *

was 13 years old when I made
the biggestsports mistake of
my life.
I had been to a handful of
Michigan gamesbefore, but as a
teenager now, the game had really
started to come together for me.
So with my grandparents' season
tickets - a pair of tickets that
would change
my life - my
dad and I
embarked for
the Big House
to see Michi-
gan take on
Washing-
ton in the RYAN
2002 season KARTJE
opener.
And as the
Wolverines traded jabs with the
Huskies, Phil Brabbs lined up in
the first quarter for a field goal
from 36 yards out. He missed. I
'still remember the look on my
dad's face when he missed that
fledgoa. And when he missed
the second one before halftime -
scratch that, shanked the second
one - I could never forget the
disappointment on his face. Sit-
tingin our seats at halftime, my
section was full of less-than-kind
words for Brabbs, and the boos
were obvious.
Brabbs was clearly shaken,
and when he missed some easy
practice kicks atchalftime, I
couldn't help but feel bad for the
guy.And when Troy Nienburg,
Michigac'sotherkicker, lined
up for and missed an easy field
goal that would've put the Wol-
verines in the driver's seat, my
dad - in his typical sports-is-a-
glass-that's-always-half-empty
fashion - declared that Michigan
would lose the game. I'm still a
bitunclear on the chain of events
that led to my dad angrily pull-
ingme up the stairs of Michigan
Stadium, but before I knew it, I
was walking past the U-M Golf
Course and away from the Big
House.
If you know Michigan football
lore, you know what happened
next. Braylon Edwards drops the
ball, Tyrece Butler jumps on it
and the ref (incorrectly) calls it
a fumble. John Navarre throws
two incomplete passes, settingup
a 60-yard field goal. Then, out of
what only could have been des-
tiny, the Huskies get called for a
.12-men-on-the-field penalty and
Phil Brabbs finds himself staring
downthegoalposts for a 44-yard
field goal.
Since that day, I've told only
close friends that I missed the
end of that game. As soon as we
got home and saw the highlights,
my dad made me promise to never
tell a soul that we left early (sorry
Dad). But asawe walked to our car,
parked a mile or so down State St.,
and listened to the car horns and
howlingchants of the Michigan
fans who had justseen a legend-
ary football game, I began to real-
ize the gravity of the situation.
There was a certain magic
to sports that couldn't be rep-
licated anywhere else. It was
just frustrating enough for us to
feel personally slighted when a
freshman kicker misses two easy
field goals. But it was also magi-
cal enough that the same kicker
could redeem himself in legend-
ary fashion two quarters later and
become a cult hero in Ann Arbor.
There is no suspense like

sports, and as I walked into the
offices of The Michigan Daily in
December of 2007, I knew that
I wanted to be the guy who put

that suspense into words, sharing
that same magic I should've felt
in watching Phil Brabbs nail that
game-winning kick. A year after
I started at the Daily, I dialed the
phone number of a certain infa-
mous Michigan kicker, who had
recently and tragically been diag-
nosed with incurable cancer.
And when Phil Brabbs
answered the phone, I didn't
immediately ask him any ques-
tions. Instead, I told him about
how I left that game early, howI
missed his kick. I told him, in that
moment, he had almost single-
handedly convinced me to be a
sportswriter and a sports fanatic.
He laughed, shocked that one
single kick from a random fresh-
man kicker could alter the course
of someone else's life. But it had.
Just like one conversation with
Red Berenson made me want
to be a feature writer. And one
television in Denard Robinson's
grandmother's garage made me
know I was making the right
decision. The Daily and this Uni-
versity and Phil Brabbs and Red
Berenson and Denard Robinson
ad so many others have given
me opportunities in the past
four years that I only could have
dreamed of had I not missed see-
ing that kick in 2002.
I've met my sports idol,
Charles Woodson, at a charity
golf tournament. I've seen last-
second comebacks at legendary
stadiums like the Big House
and Notre Dame Stadium.I've
been publicly chastised on the
Internet. I've been to Florida and
then California and then back to
Florida again. I've seen a certain
kind of heartbreak on the faces of
athletes most people will never
understand. I've talked mindless
hours about defensive football
formations or basketball recruits,
and called it work.
And I've spent 50 or so frus-
trating hours per week working
with some of the most stubborn,
egotistical, maddening, creative,
sincere, honest and amazing
people I've ever met. So many
what-ifs, so many happenstances
have put me in the position I am
today, and I will never stop being
grateful. And for those of you
who have consistently read my
columns (all three or four of you),
thanks for being there. And espe-
ciallythanks for puttingup with
my recentbouts with nostalgia.
Thanks to those of you who had
confidence in my writing, to my
friends and my family who never
doubted a single one of my crazy
ideas. Mom, Dad, John, Molly,
Amanda, Megan, Dillon, Oleg,
Tyler, Cameron, Matt, Tim, Joe,
Chantel, Burns, Nicole, Jake, Aar-
onson, Pyzik, and everyone else
who I've worked with, you guys
have made me the writer I am just
as much as Brabbs' kick did.-
A special thanks to my dad
though, who may still be embar-
rassed that we left the Big House
in 2002. But Dad, without your
frustration, that day (and a lot of
other days), we would've never
left, we would've never made the
biggest sports mistake of my life.
I would never be a writer, and I
never would have felt the magic
in sports that I do every single day
today. These past four years have
been awfully magical, and if I've
done anything for you, I hope it's
that I shared with you some of

that magic. Thank you, all of you,
for the best four years of my life.

Junior pitcher Brandon Sinnery struck out nine batters on'134 pitches in his shutout of the Fighting Illini.
Blue picks up first series win of
season against Fighting Illini

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
The series had all the familiar
themes for the Michigan base-
ball team: mental mistakes, big
innings and slumbering bats.
Only this time, Michigan (4-5
Big Ten, 11-23 overall) found
itself in an I
unfamil- MICHIGAN 2
iar role. In
their week-
end series ILLINOIS 0
against MICHIGAN 3
Illinois, the
Wolver- ILLINOIS 6
ines were MICHIGAN 7
the ones
capitalizing on their opponent's
mistakes. The Wolverines were
the ones putting up crooked
numbers. And the Wolverines
were the ones shutting down the
opponent's lineup.
Illinois (4-5, 12-19) knocked
the Wolverines around for a
9-2 victory in the first game of
the three-game set on Friday.
But in Sunday's double-header,
Michigan rode junior right-
hander Brandon Sinnery's com-
plete-game shutout in the first
game and a late-game comeback
in the nightcap to take the series.
It was Michigan's first series
win all season.
Michigan coach Rich Malo-
ney has said several times this
season that, sooner or later, a
pitcher would turn in a gem and
go deep into the game. He prob-
ably just didn't think it would

take this long.
Or come from Sinnery.
But Sinnery, who was dropped
from the rotation earlier this
year, was dominant, striking out
nine batters on 134 pitches en
route to a 3-0 victory. The first
five outs he recorded in the sec-
ond game were strikeouts, and
he only surrendered four hits
and one walk in his complete-
game performance.
He almost didn't get the
chance, though.
"I was going to take him out
going into the ninth," Maloney
said.
Sinnery, though, had other
plans.
"I had a shutout going," Sin-
nery said. "And I wanted to fin-
ish it."
In the second game of the
double-header on Sunday, Illi-
nois quickly made up for lost
time. A Michigan error led to an
Illinois run in the top of the first,
and the Illini added two more in
the second.
Leading by two runs in the
seventh, Illinois appeared to be
closing the door on any hopes
the Wolverines had to win the
series.
Then they opened it back up.
After two singles, a rare throw-
ing error by sophomore third
baseman Brandon Hohl, who
had been brilliant in the field all
series, allowed Michigan to cut
the lead to one.'

MEN'S GYMNASTICS
Freshman Mikulak becomes third
Wolverine to win NCAA All-Around

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - In 2010, Chris
Cameron became just the second
Michigan gymnast to ever win
the NCAA All-Around crown.
One year later, freshman Sam
Mikulak became the third Wol-
verine gymnast and the first
freshman to become the All-
Around champion in the history
of the NCAA.
These accomplishments came
just two weeks after he became
the first freshman to win the Big
Ten All-Around Title since 1994.
Mikulak's score of 90.75 this past
weekend was .25 higher than
Cameron's score from the year
before.
The former all-around cham-
pion recognizes the talent Miku-
lak has.
"(Mikulak's) a much better
gymnast than this country has
really ever seen as far as being
the complete and entire pack-
age," Cameron said. "I'm just
glad to see somebody that has the
ability to reach his potential."
Along with winning the all-
around title in 2010, Cameron
was also the NCAA floor exercise
champion. But for the majority
of this season he was unable to
compete - or if he did partici-
pate, it was only on one or two
events because of injuries and ill-
nesses.
After not competing at the Big

Ten Championships, it was an
improvement for Cameron to go
out and perform this past week-
end. Though he competed in
the all-around, a fall on pommel
horse put him out of contention
for the repeat performance.
"I'm not going to lie," Cameron
said. "It was hard to finish (my
career) knowing that I was more
prepared and mentally ready to
go for the past two years. Cer-
tain difficulties come your way,
and your life kind of jumps past
college while you're still there.
That's what happened in my
case."
But Cameron still plans to con-
tinue gymnastics as a member of
the U.S. National Team next year.
During the championships,
each team is allowed six compet-
itors for each event, and four of
those six count towards the team
score. Gymnasts who participate
in the all-around tend to exhibi-
tion one or two events because
they aren't in the top-six on their
respective teams.
Since Cameron excelled on
events like the pommel horse,
floor and rings, he was weaker
on the high bar and had to exhi-
bition the vault in 2010. Mikulak
excels on certain events also, but
his weaknesses are lesser in com-
parison.
Mikulak's score was top-three
in every event for Michigan on
Friday.
"(Mikulak) does one of the

Freshman Sam Mikulak became the first freshman Ail-Around champion i
history of the NCAA with a score of 90.75.

most difficult vaults in the world
and there's not too many people
that can hang with him on floor,
either," Michigan coach Kurt
Golder said. "His weaker events
are coming. (Parallel) bars went
from an average event to a strong
event, and high bar, rings and
pommel will get better over the
summer. He won't have a weak-
ness come next year."
The fact that he had the sec-
ond-highest score of any Wolver-
ine on the high bar and pommel
horse - hisweak events - speaks
volumes to his talent.
When Mikulak vied for a spot
on the national team last fall in

the Winter Cup Invitational, he
came up just short. Two years
ago, Cameron became the first
Wolverine to earn a spot on that
same national team since 1999. If
Mikulak keeps this up after the
season, he and Cameron may not
have to wait long to be reunited
as teammates.
"(Cameron) helped (Mikulak)
a lot this year," Golder said on
Saturday. "I've seen them talking
one-on-one and (Cameron) giv-
ing him encouragement, routine
ideas and so forth. To have two
NCAA All-Around champions
on the team at the same time is
amazing."

From Page 4B
It wasn't Kim's first time at
Augusta - he had visited three
times earlier in the year to get a
feel for the course - but it was a
first of many other things.
"It was my first time playing in
front of a real crowd," Kim said
after the practice round. "But I
wasn't nervous at all, partially
because I was with my good
buddy (Johnson)."
Johnson and Kim spent the
practice round working mainly
around the greens - testing the
speeds, analyzing the breaks,
and getting a feel for golf's fierc-
est greens.
"I was very pleased that a guy
of his caliber still keeps up with
a friend like me and just tries to
catch up on me," Kim said. "That
just shows his character - nice,
genuine."
Added Johnson: "We had a
great time. He's matured a lot,
and his golf game is really good."
Masters Monday was his first
real taste of golf's brightest spot-
light, but Kim was certainly not
alone in his quest to handle his
new-found recognition.
ONE OF MANY
traditions at Augusta National
is to have the amateurs stay at
"the Crow's Nest" - a dorm-like
room at the top of the infamous
clubhouse.
Jack Nicklaus and Tiger
Woods both stayed there as ama-
teurs, and the tradition oozes out
of every standard piece of furni-
ture in the room.
But Lion Kim politely declined
the offer to stay at the Nest - his
family was with him for the week,
and he wanted to spend as much
time as he could with them.
And while most players
arrived to Augusta in private jets
or in the comfort of first class
seating, Kim decided to drive
down with the people he called
his "lucky charms" - his par-
ents, Yong and Hyun.
"It's gonna mean a lot," Kim

said the week before the Masters
about being at the tournament
with his parents. "I'm going to
have a great support system, and
it's just going to give me some
confidence and definitely make
me feel comfortable out there."
But it wasn't the first time
his parents served as a calming
influence in Kim's young golfing
career.
Hyun was in Greensboro with
her son during the US Amateur
Public Links, following him on
every hole. And when he needed
some reassurance the most -
during the seven-hour rain delay
in the final round to qualify for
the Masters - Hyun was there
for him.
"I have to give all the credit to
my mom," Kim said after his vic-
tory. "We talked a lot. She kept
me relaxed. We talked about
everything, even from my child-
hood days. Literally everything
that we could talk about we talk-
ed about in those seven hours."
With his family by his side,
Lion Kim was ready to embrace
the spotlight.
HE WAS HITTING
balls on the range on Masters
Tuesday as he was approached
by a man with dark hair spilling
out of his PING visor.
"Oh, are you Lion Kim? I
signed up to play with you (in the
par-3 contest)," the man said.
It was Kim's favorite play-
er - Bubba Watson, the lefty
from Bagdad, Fla. known for his
booming drives and playful per-
sonality.
The rising star and two-time
PGA Tour Champion introduced
himself as if Kim wouldn't even
know who he was.
"That was pretty amazing,"
Kim said the day before the par-3
contest. "We're going to have
a blast. He's obviously a great
young stud out here, so I'm going
to learn a lot from him as well."
The next day, Watson and
Kim, along with three-time PGA
Tour Champion Aaron Baddeley,
played in the contest together.
Kim finished the contest even

- five strokes back from the
winner Luke Donald - but com-
peting in the par-3 contest was
about much more than just scor-
ing well. In fact, historically it
has been a curse to win the con-
test, as the winner almost always
goes on to do poorly in the actual
tournament.
"It was great," Kim said after
the round. "Bubba and Aaron
were great sports, and we had a
lot of fun just staying loose and
not taking it too seriously."
While the mood remained
light throughout the contest, it
became more serious as the sun
set and the lights dimmed one
final time before the opening
round of the 2011 Masters. Kim
was slated in the 12:31 tee time
with Olazabal and Love III the
next day.
AFTER THE PERFECT
opening to his Masters debut on
Thursday, the bright southern
sun beganto shine even brighter
on Kim - and he began to show
signs of his youth.
The high of his first-hole birdie
had faded - quickly.
Bogey onthe fourth hole. Bogey
on the sixth. Bogey on the par-5
eighth.
A birdie on the ninth provided a
brief respite, but it was followed by
another bogey on the 10th.
And then, the round-killer: dou-
ble bogey on the 11th - the first
hole of Amen Corner.
Kim hita nice drive but yanked
his second shot left into the pond
that lines the leftside of the green.
And even he knew at that point
things were beginning to unravel.
"The second shot, I was not
committed," Kim said. "All week,
I'd been hitting a draw, and obvi-
ously I had to cut that shota little
bit. And I came right over it."
But then Kim began to show
signs of life. Par on the 12th and
birdie on the 13th - the final hole
of Amen Corner.
He finished the round at 4-over
(76), and even after the flurry of
bogeys, he was still within strik-
ing distance of the weekend.
On Friday, he came out ready

to face the bright lights like a sea-
soned veteran.
Six pars, two birdies and a
bogey en route to a front nine
score of 35 (1-under) and 3-over
overall - suddenly, he was right
back in the hunt to make the cut.
"I knew if I shot under par on
the back, I would have a good
chance of playing through the
weekend," Kim said after the
round. "I had a number in mind."
He parred all three holes of
Amen Corner, hitting solid shot
after solid shot and knocking
down five-to-10 footers with
ease.
He remained solid on holes
No. 13 through 17, parring each
hole and hanging around the
cut line at 3-over. As he walked
up to the 18th tee, Kim knew he
had one last chance to extend his
dream to the weekend.
LION KIM STOOD
on the 18th green on Masters Fri-
day, studying a nearly impossible
35-foot putt for birdie from just
off the green.
He knew he was hovering
around the cut line, and in order
to have any chance to make the
cut, he'd have to sink the bomb.
"That putt is one we practiced
all the time," his caddy Laurence
said.
It was a putt that would have
to make the shape of a horseshoe
before making it to the hole -
the type of putt that drives any-
body nuts at the putt-putt course.
After minutes of deliberating,
Kim let the putt loose, aiming a
solid twenty feet away from the
hole in order to give the ball a
chance to work off the slope and
back toward the hole.
The ball hit the peak of the
horseshoe and looked as though
it were about to come back down
the slope - but it hung up in the
fringe, refusing to budge and
stopping nearly 25 feet away
from the hole.
"If that putt comes off, it
comes right to the hole," Lau-
rence said. "We knew it, and I
just wanted to make sure he got
it there. It wasn't way too much

hard, itjust wouldn't come off."
Instead, he was left with a
25-footer for par - a putt not
much easier than his original look
at birdie.
He missed the par putt and
tapped in for bogey for a two-day
score of 148 (4-over).
He took off his visor and shook
hands with Olazabal and Love III.
It was over. -Lion Kim had
missed the cut.
KIM TRIED TO
remain positive in his post-round
interviews.
After all, he did still score bet-
ter than nine former Masters
Champions and both his play-
ing partners, Olazabal and Love
III, and he was just a 21-year-old
amateur.
"Competing as an amateur, it
doesn't get any better," Kim said.
"I scored better than I did yes-
terday, but I'm still disappointed
with the way I finished there ...
But overall, it was a great week.

I can not complain about any-
thing."
As fans gathered around him,
Kim walkedback to the clubhouse
to share a meal with his family.
And then, he went back to work.
He walked back to the range,
hitting shot after shot, thinking n
about what he could do differently
next time.
Maybe next time, he won't hit
his second shot left on the 11th.
Maybe next time, he'lbe the Tour
pro in the picture with the starry-
eyed fan. Maybe next time, they'll
be able to pronounce his name cor-
rectly at the first tee.
Maybe next time, he'll have that
same putt on the 18th, and he'll
know the break just a little better.
And maybe next time, he'll drain
it.
As darkness overcame the hal-
lowed grounds of Augusta Nation-
al that Sunday, the sun set on the
2011 Masters.
But for Lion Kim, the sun has
just begun to rise.


MATTISON
From Page 1
The confidence the defense has
played with this spring has been
fueled by their ability to grasp
Mattison's defensive schemes in a
matter of three weeks.
And they have their fun out
there, too. Martin said they'll
throw in some dummy-words
and fake calls to spice it up - only
they know who's coming, which
makes it hard on the opposing
quarterback.
"The zone blitzes are awesome
too - there's going to be times
I drop out and Mike's going to
come in, (and) Will (Campbell)

might slant outside," Van Bergen
said. "The thing coach Mattison
goes with is unpredictability.,You
don't know where we're going to
be, so that way you can't plan for
it. I think that's going to be suc-
cessful."
The battle between the offense
and defense this spring ended
with the defense, perhaps, get-
ting the upper hand. Besides Rob-
inson's one long run, he didn't
torch the first team defense.
And though sophomore
quarterback Devin Gardner
did throw a touchdown pass to
junior Je'Ron Stokes late, he also
threw two interceptions - one
to spring-game standout Carvin
Johnson and the other to red-

shirt freshman linebacker Jake
Ryan, who returned the pick for a
touchdown.
What Hoke and Mattison
remembered wasn't the multiple
sacks the defense registered or
the interceptions - it was the
68-yard touchdown run Mike
Cox broke against the second-
team defense and the long run by
Robinson.
"The one thing I didn't like was
big plays, especially with the first
unit or any unit," Mattison said,
who adding he usually saves his
analysis for after he watches the
film. "Our unit can't be what we
want to be if we allow them to get
big chunks."
The zero points by the first-

team offense and the 14 points
scored by the second-team
offense wasa" positive ,-Matti-
son is OK with bending, just not
breaking.
"We've tried to make abigthing
about, as long as we have a place
to stand, as long as that ball isn't
across that endzone, then we're
still a good defense," Mattison
said. "And we've really worked on
that. And I think they're starting
to buy it and believe that. I think
I heard one of them say that out
there in that situation."
Multiple defensive players
used the word fun to describe
what they were doing under Mat-
tison.
The defense's own coach

would taunt Robinson, saying
he couldn't throw the football
throughout the-spring. Robinson:
would make a play and smile back'
at Mattison.
His defense had more success
than one might expect consider-
ing the unit finished close to last
in Division Iin total defense.
"Our offense has really, really
tested us and beaten us during
the spring at times," Mattison
said. "It's helped us that they are
going to be a physical, power-
type offense, and as well as being
able to get Denard to do what he
does.
"And that really makes it hard
on a defense when you can't just
say this is a spread team and OK,

'We're going to run this defense.
Then all of a sudden you're going
against a power team."
The estimated Spring Game
crowd of about 27,000 people
included 1997 Heisman trophy
winner Charles Woodson, who
expressed his pleasure with the
return of a defensive emphasis.
It's starting with Mattison's
NFL-like blitz packages.
When Martin was asked
whether he and his fellow defend-
ers were pickingup all of the com-
plicated schemes and calls, he
was confident they were already
comfortable.
"I think the offense needs to
try and pick it up better," Martin
said with a chuckle.

nation. And all spring, the talk
of how to improve the defensive
backfield has focused on who
hasn't been on the field rather
than who has. Redshirt junior
J.T. Floyd and fifth-year senior
Troy Woolfolk both sat out the
spring game, still recovering
from ankle injuries.
Johnson was on the field and
could be a bigger part of the fix.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke said
earlier in the week Johnson had
taken a leadership role on the

footrace with the secondary - a
68-yard sprint for the game's first
touchdown.
"I thought he had a really good
day today," Hoke said of Cox. "I
thought his patience was pretty
good, and I thought he hit the
hole pretty well a couple times."
Hoke, an admittedly defensive-
minded head coach, is keeping a
close eye on the backs. Cox is in
a five-man battle for the start-
ing spot at tailback in the fall and
thinks the new-look offense plays
to his strengths in the backfield.
"When I came in, I committed
to coach Carr, and I committed
to this type of system," Cox said.
"I'm definitely happy to be back in
the system that I came here for."
Instead of the predominately
shotgun formations that the
offense worked under for the past
three years, it's a pro-style look
with multiple running backs. And

back end as one of the more vocal
players.
It may be a comfort issue -
Johnson is returning to the posi-
tion he played in high school
after playing spur linebacker last
season. He played with the first-
team defense Saturday alongside
sophomore Courtney Avery, red-
shirt junior Jordan Kovacs and
redshirt senior Tony Anderson,
but he hasn't solidified a starting
spot.
With Kovacs, sophomore
Marvin Robinson and Thomas
Gordon vying for playing time,
the battle should continue well
into fall practice.

For now, Johnson led a sec-
ondary that had a couple of turn-
overs but also gave up a couple
big plays - a long pass and a
68-yard run - that led to the
offense's two touchdowns.
"That safety has got to be the
guy to get them down," Mattison
said. "They have to get the guy
down if he breaks through the
that line of scrimmage. I'm going
to say there's a play or two there
where the safety wasn't where
he's supposed to be."
The secondary as a whole
came ready to play. Anderson
broke up a fade route to redshirt
junior Roy Roundtree on the

opening drive. Johnson made
his negated interception the next
drive.
Saturday was the first step
for a secondary still on the
mend from getting beaten all
of 2010 and still adjusting to
the new defensive scheme that
Hoke and Mattison are putting
in place.
"It's about being more
aggressive, that's all it's about,"
Johnson said. "(Secondary
coach Curt) Mallory talks to us
about it every day, 'Stop playing
so tentative and just go at it.'
Because if we sit back on wide
receivers, they make moves on

us and we're done." the secondary's spring game,
And judging by Johnson's and both are far from done.

from 5-foot-6, 180-pound junior
Vincent Smith to 6-foot, 227-
pound sophomore Stephen Hop-
kins, Hoke wants the backs ready
to play multiple roles.
"They want all of us to learn
both tailback and fullback, so
everybody's doing that," Cox said.
"They want everybody to have an
all-around game, so you can't play
if you can't block or can't run.
"I think I'm an all-around
player. I'm big, I'm fast, I'm quick
and I just want to find my role and
help the team out."
Last season, Michigan's
offense was driven by dynamic,
highlight-reel runs from sopho-
more quarterback Denard Rob-
inson. Robinson opened the game
by cutting across the field for a
gain of 55 yards. That was no sur-
prise - people knew he could do
that.
But the offense expects to be
more multi-dimensional this time
around.
Michigan offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges admitted the spring
4

game featured the running backs
for a reason, but "in the real
world" Robinson will remain a
focal point in the running game.
"We're making a transforma-
tion here, and you don't learn
about this transformation by
quarterback running every play,"
Borges said. "We did a few nice
things in terms of moving the
line of scrimmage on a few power
plays, so we made some headway
that way, but we're still a little
rough around the edges."
After the final whistle, Jackson
kneeled with the running backs
- a group of eight players - at
the 35-yard line while Robinson
jogged into the tunnel to the big-
gest cheers of the day.
In four months, with the
resurgence of Michigan's heyday
power backfield, the backs in the
huddle at the 35-yard line could
play as crucial a role as the speedy
quarterback.
"I feel like the old Michigan is
coming back," Cox said, walking
off the field with a smile.

say that we're going to miss her
next year is really an under-
statement. She's a very special
athlete, and more importantly a
very special person."
While many would assume an
athlete with Botterman's abil-
ity and love for her sport would
have aspirations to compete at
the next level, this will actually
be her final year of competi-
tion. Instead she is focused on
graduation and on her wedding
to former Michigan hockey star
Chad Kolarik. The Wolverine
power couple has finally set the
date - August 5. Botterman has
become a name synonymous
with many words, but she has
always been a woman of very
few. She summed up the end of
her career in one sentence.
"The ride has been fun, but
bittersweet now that it's done,"
Botterman said.
