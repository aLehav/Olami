White supremacist Richard 

Spencer 
and 
lawyer 
Kyle 

Bristow are pressuring the 
University of Michigan to find 
a date and “reasonable location 
on 
campus” 
for 
Spencer’s 

potential speech on campus by 
Jan. 15, Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day, Bristow announced in a 
press release on Thursday.

“Either select a date by 

January 
15, 
2018—Martin 

Luther King Jr. Day—at 5:00 
p.m., or else be sued in federal 
court 
just 
like 
Michigan 

State University, Ohio State 
University, 
Pennsylvania 

State University, and Auburn 
University,” the release read.

According to the release, 

as part of the negotiations 
between the University and 
Spencer’s team, the University 
has also already offered several 
dates for an event: Nov. 29 
and 30 — just a week after the 
University announced it would 
be entering negotiations — and 
Dec. 27 and 28, when many 
students would be away from 
campus for Winter Break.

“None of (the dates) have 

been convenient for the event 
organizers,” Bristow wrote in 
the release.

Georgia 
State 
University 

student Cameron Padgett — a 
student who has been making 
requests on Spencer’s behalf 
at 
other 
universities 
such 

as 
Penn 
State 
University, 

Michigan State University and 
the University of Florida, and 
who made the original request 
for a potential event at the 
University — is now requesting 
a date between Feb. 24 and 
March 4, which covers the 
University’s Spring Break. The 
administration is considering 
the request, Bristow — who 
represents Padgett — said.

While the administration 

has 
repeatedly 
emphasized 

that students’ safety is their 
first priority in negotiations, 
students have responded there 
are no circumstances under 
which they would feel safe. 
At the University’s Board of 
Regents’ meeting on Thursday, 
Central Student Government 
President 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 

an LSA senior, presented a 
petitionagainst 
Spencer’s 

presence, which she said had 
been signed by over 5,000 

students since being sent out 
Tuesday. A separate petition 
from alumni, she said, has 
received over 6,200 signatures.

“I 
echo 
thousands 
of 

students 
and 
community 

members when I say we will not 
be safe if he and his followers 
come to our campus,” Sarkar 
said. “Richard Spencer should 
not be accommodated.”

According to an email from 

Native 
American 
Studies 

students and faculty submitted 
a 
request 
to 
University 
of 

Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s office Wednesday to 
investigate whether the land on 
which the University’s Biological 
Station sits belongs to the Burt 
Lake Band of Odawa and Ojibwa 
Native American tribes.

According to the statement, 

in the late 1800s, Cheboygan 
County had been illegally taxing 
Native lands granted to them in 
the Treaty of Detroit. The Burt 
Lake Band failed to pay these 
taxes and their deeds were then 
sold to Watts S. Humphrey and 
John McGinn. However, the Burt 
Lake Band refused to leave this 
property.

Stanford University professor 

Richard 
White 
wrote 
about 

this tribe in his ethnohistorical 
report that was included in the 
request. On Oct. 15, 1900, Sheriff 
Fred Ming and his deputies went 
into the Burt Lake Band village, 
evicted the Native Americans, 
poured kerosene on their homes 
and lit them on fire as the

Despite

staff members, the #WeExist 
campaign 
— 
consisting 
of 

students 
from 
all 
three 

University

campuses — faced conflicting 
opinions 
in 
response 
to 

their request to implement a 
Middle Eastern/North African 
identity category to University 
documents 
at 
the 
Regents 

meeting Thursday afternoon.

Last February, a resolution 

in favor of creating a ME/NA 
identity category was passed by 
Central Student Government 
unanimously, while a similar 
resolution was passed by LSA 
Student Government earlier 
this fall.

Initially 
spearheaded 

by #WeExist in November, 
the 
letter 
describes 
the 

problematic nature of failing 
to 
include 
the 
ME/NA

In 
partnership 
with 
the 

University of Michigan, the 
national organization HeForShe, 
hosted Professional Women in 
ConversationThursday evening, 
a panel that highlighted the 
gender inequality and other 
challenges professional women 
face, especially those pursuing 
traditionally 
male-dominated 

careers.

HeForShe is a campaign 

founded in 2014 by UN Women 
to promote gender equality 
and encourage women and 
men alike to become agents of 
change. It arrived campus in 
the fall of 2016 to reduce sexual 
violence and educate on gender 
issues on campus.

LSA junior Meghan Brody, 

education chair of HeForShe, 
said Thursday’s panel was a part 
of a series of events held over 
the course of the week to raise 
awareness about these issues.

“I really wanted to give 

undergraduate students who 

are in male-dominated fields, 
be that men or women or people 
who don’t identify as either, an 
opportunity to talk to someone 
who is a part of (those fields) in 
a comfortable space where they 
didn’t have to feel like there was 
a dumb question and where if 
they wanted to learn more about 
the issues surrounding these 
fields they would have a space to 
do that.”

The two panelists, Chloe 

Siamof 
and 
Stephanie 

Wightman, spoke about their 
experience in the sports and 
software development words, 
respectively. Siamof is a 2016 
Yale graduate and a designer 
for 
the 
sports 
architecture 

firm ROSETTI. Wightman is a 
University of Michigan alum and 
currently a software developer 
at ProModel Corporation.

University alum Stephanie 

Wightman, panelist and the 
president of the Detroit chapter 
of Women in Sports and Events, 
said she first experienced the 
sexism ingrained in her field in 
her high school robotics class.

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

opened the University’s Board 
of Regents December meeting 
on Thursday by expressing his 
dissatisfaction with the two 
tax bills recently passed by the 
U.S. House and Senate and their 
impacts on graduate students at 
the University. Schlissel said the 
bills end tax benefits that help 

students pay for college.

“If enacted, (the tax bills) 

would 
make 
it 
harder 
for 

students to earn a college degree 
or to pursue a Ph.D. here at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
and 

across the nation,” Schlissel 
said. “Higher education is a key 
driver of social mobility and 
economic growth in American 
society. College degrees prepare 
students to compete in a rapidly 
evolving job market and to live 
more enriching lives. Several 
provisions in these bills would 
undermine our students.”

The meeting then continued 

and covered several other topics 
such as Richard Spencer and 
LEO bargaining.

Richard Spencer
Several 
students 
and 

other speakers during public 
comment vocally opposed white 
supremacist Richard Spencer’s 
request to speak on campus, 
which the University announced 
it would proceed with at an 
emergency Board of Regents’ 
meeting on Nov. 21.

Rackham 
student 
Naomi 

Wilson, president of Rackham 

Student Government, said it 
would be “careless” to allow 
Spencer 
on 
campus. 
After 

initially 
denying 
Spencer’s 

request 
to 
speak 
on 
their 

campus, the University of Florida 
allowed a speech in October 
after Spencer’s team threatened 
a lawsuit. Following the event, 
three White supremacists were 
charged with attempted murder 
after shooting at protesters.

“I urge you all to focus and 

hone in on the need of students 
to be physically and emotionally

Multiple 
student 

organizations are boycotting 
the Office of Multi-Ethnic 
Student Affairs’ search for 
a 
new 
associate 
director 

after members of the Latino 
community asked for stake in 
the hiring process and were 
not given an opportunity to. 
The group sough to increase 
Latino 
representation 
in 

leadership positions at the 
University of Michigan due to 
the continued lack of Latino 
representation in University 
administration.

After 
the 
recent 

appointment of Nadia Bazzy 
as MESA director, La Casa, 
the 
Latinx 
Alliance 
for 

Community Action, Support 
and 
Advocacy, 
has 
asked 

other groups to boycott the 
hiring process and asked the 
three candidates to decline 
to be interviewed until the 
University’s 
“exclusionary 

practices” 
are 
addressed, 

according to a statement. As 
part of the Office of Student 
Life, MESA offers programs, 
outreach and student training 
to 
promote 
diversity 
and 

inclusion on campus.

“The lack of representation 

of the Latinx community in 
leadership positions directly 
opposes the University’s highly 
promoted goals of diversity, 
equity, and inclusion,” the 
statement 
reads. 
“These 

exclusionary practices further 
exemplify that the Latinx 
voice is not valued by the 
University, Latinx students 
and 
community 
members 

should not aspire to be leaders 
on our campus, and that the 

Latinx community has no 
value at the University of 
Michigan.”

In a previous statement 

regarding Bazzy’s new role, 
La 
Casa 
said 
they 
were 

dissatisfied 
“not 
with 
the 

individual appointed as the 
new director” but with the 
procedure 
by 
which 
she 

was selected, citing a hiring 
process 
that 
“denied 
the 

Latinx voice.” According to 
La Casa, Bazzy is the fifth 
consecutive hire MESA has 
made that did not result in 
the employment of a Latino 
individual. 

Public Policy junior Yvonne 

Navarrete, lead director of La 
Casa, said programs intended 
to support underrepresented 
groups often don’t take Latinx 
students into consideration.

 
“There 
is 
a 
disconnect 

with these offices as they 
do not actively engage with 
our community in order 
to understand our needs,” 
Navarrete said. “The Latinx 
community should have a voice 
during hiring processes and 
when evaluating candidates 
for positions that affect our 
community.”

The 
executive 
board 
of 

the United Asian American 
Organizations and the Muslim 
Students’ 
Association 
have 

expressed 
support 
for 
La 

Casa, and stated they will not 
be participating in the hiring 
process for the new associate 
director.

In an email obtained by 

The Daily, the MSA executive 
board wrote that La Casa’s 
concern about the selection of 
Student Life administrators 
was “legitimate.”

“We can attest the process 

by 
which 
students 
are 

involved in Student Life hiring 
decisions can be inconsistent 
and lacking in transparency,” 

Student groups boycott MESA 
over lack of Latino representation

La Casa stated they were not included in the search for a new director 

LEAH GRAHAM
Daily Staff Reporter

Every Friday, The Michigan 
Daily republishes an article from 
The Daily’s archives from a 
moment in University history. 

The campus woke up to a 

winter wonderland surprise, 
as one of the most severe 
snowstorms in recent memory 
hit Ann Arbor early yesterday 
morning. 

Nine inches of snow, along 

with high winds that blew it 
all over streets and sidewalks, 
made the trip to class yesterday 
treacherous for students and 
faculty alike. 

“Well, there was a lot of snow 

to walk through — up to my 
knees,” said Kari Ifkovits, an 
LSA first-year student, who had 
an anthropology section at 9:00 
a.m. “I was slipping around and 
fell on my butt, but I’m OK.”

University grounds workers 

began clearing the streets at 
7:00 a.m. “We’ve been working 

all day” said Kim Mata, a 
worker in the moving and 
trucking department, which is 
responsible for University snow 
removal. 

Despite the ground crews’ 

efforts, students complained 
that not enough had been done.

“The roads and sidewalks 

were not cleared enough,” said 
LSA senior Geneva Eaddy, 
who had four classes to attend. 
“There were big clumps of snow 
and there wasn’t enough salt on 
the roads or sidewalks.” 

Third-year Law student 

Bernard Hooper said he was 
caught off guard by the storm. 
He didn’t expect all of the snow, 
and had trouble traversing the 
campus early in the morning. 

“Apparently, the ground 

crews at the University didn’t 
expect it either,” Hooper 
quipped. “But they did do a great 
job of cleaning it up between the 
hours of 8 and 10.”

Indeed, conditions improved 

as the day progressed. By 1:00 
p.m. many roads and sidewalks 
had been cleared of snow, and 
traffic once again started to 
move. Salt was also spread in 
many areas to melt lingering ice 
slicks. 

But that did not help LSA 

sophomore Jin-Ho Chung, 
whose 1:00 p.m. English lecture 
was cancelled. Most of the 
students showed up for class but 
Professor Lillian Back, who lives 
out of town, found the roads 
impassible. 

“We drove for one exit in 

the four-wheel drive and were 
afraid, so we got off,” Back said. 

Communications Professor 

Joan Lowenstein, an Ann 
Arbor resident, said she could 
have held her scheduled office 
hours yesterday morning, but 
was besieged by other weather-
related problems. 

“Well, because the schools 

were closed, my son who usually 
goes to school had to stay home, 
and also I have a baby who goes 
to a babysitter,” Lowenstein 
said. “The roads were too 
dangerous for me to drive a baby 
to the babysitter, so I stayed 
home.”

Most classes, however, were 

not cancelled. 

When asked if his classes 

were cancelled, Business school 
senior Paul Schwartzman 
replied, “Unfortunately, no.” 

Though his classes were 

on, Schwartzman had trouble 
making it to class from his house 
near Washtenaw. 

“The streets were really icy,” 

he said, adding, “there were a 
lot of little snowbanks, and the 
crosswalks were blocked.”

safe. Safety is critical to students, 
and I’m thinking about the 
ones who came here for the 
first time, thinking they would 
be in a university where they 
could thrive academically and 
socially, only now to be faced 
with a speaker who not only 
denies their humanity, but also 
would bring others like him to 
campus,” Wilson said. “This is 
simply unsafe, and careless to 
have someone here who could, in 
reality, start a riot.”

LSA senior Anushka Sarkar, 

president of Central Student 
Government, presented a petition 
opposing 
a 
potential 
speech 

from Spencer, saying it received 
more 
than 
5,000 
signatures 

from students. She said a similar 
petition circulated among alumni 
had received more than 6,200 
signatures.

“I echo thousands of students 

and community members when I 
say we will not be safe if he and his 
followers come to our campus,” 
Sarkar said. “Richard Spencer 
should not be accommodated.”

Social Work student Lawrielle 

West said the issue was bigger 
than 
just 
Richard 
Spencer’s 

presence 
on 
campus, 
but 

extended to white supremacy at 
the University in general.

“Some might say, ‘Hmm, what 

do you mean white supremacy is 
on campus?’” West said. “Well, 
this is what white supremacy 
looks like at the University of 
Michigan: White supremacy looks 
like a Regent Board that is torn 
between the First Amendment 
right — which is not and never 
has been equity-distributed to 
all — and student safety, which 
should not be limited to physical, 
but psychological and mental 
safety as well.”

Arbor, 
spoke 

directly to University Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein 
(D) 
during 

public 
comment, 
referencing 

his statement from the Nov. 21 
emergency 
Regents’ 
meeting 

announcing the University would 
proceed in negotiations with 
Spencer.

“We 
could 
deny 
Richard 

Spencer, 
everyone 
would 

celebrate, this board would be 
cheered, 
President 
Schlissel 

would be applauded, but we 
would be dancing on our own 
graves,” Bernstein said at the 
November 
meeting. 
“On 
our 

tombstones would read: Here 
lies the University of Michigan, 
afraid to do the right and difficult 
thing.”

“Here’s the problem: Reality 

is the problem. You need to come 

out of the world of books and 
ideas and take a look around, 
because we’re looking not at 
metaphorical 
tombstones 
but 

at real tombstones,” Prozinski 
said. “That’s why lawyers are 
insufficient leaders in times like 
this — your vision is too narrow, 
and your trust in the law to 
protect us is too great.”

In 
response 
to 
Prozinski, 

Bernstein said the problem was 
not reality, but the Constitution.

“I’ve heard people urge us 

to say no, and you have every 
right, and an obligation, in fact, 
as a private citizen to say no 
to Richard Spencer’s vile and 
repugnant views,” he said. “But if 
you give government — which is 
what this institution is — the right 
to say no to speech that it doesn’t 
like or that it doesn’t want to 
hear or that may be provocative, 
government simply will. And 
what that means is the next time a 
marginalized community speaks 
out, government will just say no.”

Overall, Wilson said, it was 

imperative the actions of the 
administration in dealing with 
Spencer be as transparent as 
possible.

“As someone who has been at 

universities longer than I care to 
say right now, I understand the 
need to withhold information 
until necessary, but you all 
also must understand the lived 
experiences 
and 
position 
of 

students who feel that they are 
being left in the dark on a lot of 
issues circling around campus,” 
she said.

According 
to 
a 
Thursday 

press 
release 
from 
attorney 

Kyle Bristow, a representative 
for 
Georgia 
State 
University 

student Cameron Padgett who is 
making these requests on behalf 
of Spencer, the University had 
already offered four dates — Nov. 
29 and 30 and Dec. 27 and 28 — as 
possibilities for Spencer’s event, 
but Spencer is now seeking to 
hold an event between Feb. 24 and 
March 4 — over the University’s 
Spring Break.

LEO Bargaining
During 
public 
comment, 

representatives and supporters 
of 
the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization spoke in favor of 
lecturers and the positive work 
they do in the classroom and 
elsewhere on campus.

In recent months, LEO has 

been at the bargaining table 
with University administration 
and has staged demonstrations 
in hopes of improving benefits, 
wages and job security for 
lecturers at the University.

LSA senior Neala Berkowski 

said lecturers have been behind 
some of the most meaningful 
work she has accomplished at 
the University and they deserve 
to be compensated fairly. She 
said she believes the Board 

of Regents has the ability to 
support the work lecturers do 
by providing them with fairer 
wages and other resources.

“I’m here to call you out 

for your amoral treatment of 
lecturers while you still have 
the opportunity to do something 
about it,” Birkowski said. “These 
are 
people 
with 
advanced 

degrees and often a lot of debt. … 
Lecturers bend over backwards 
for their students and you 
literally give them the scraps.”

Rackham 
student 
Rachel 

Miller, 
current 
president 

of 
the 
Graduate 
Employees 

Organization, supported LEO 
and their bargaining, saying 
many 
departments 
at 
the 

University are heavily dependent 
on the work of lecturers. She 
gave her support for LEO’s 
bargaining efforts having come 
from GEO’s bargaining sessions 
last 
year 
that 
resulted 
in 

increased University support for 
DEI positions and mental health 
co-pay caps.

Andrew 
DeOrio, 
lecturer 

of 
Computer 
Science 
and 

Engineering, 
said 
while 

lecturers allow students to take 
more classes in their interests, 
he is having a difficult time 
attracting 
lecturers 
to 
the 

University because the pay is 
not as high as it is in private 
companies.

“It’s lecturers that have made 

it possible for every student who 
wants some computing in their 
education to do so,” DeOrio 
said. “As the chair of the search 
committee for lecturers (in 
Computer Science), I’ve lost a lot 
of recruits and potential hires. 
It’s really hard to get people to 
do this job.”

Investments
A $100 million investment 

in Y Combinator, a startup 
accelerator company, and a $39.5 
million parking structure on 
Wall Street were both approved 
by the Board of Regents.

The Y Combinator investment 

will provide seed funding to 
support the development of 
startups across the country. 
Started in 2005, Y Combinator 
funded 
Airbnb 
and 
Reddit 

during its tenure.

The 
parking 
structure 

project, which will be paid for 
by the University’s Logistics, 
Transportation 
& 
Parking 

resources and will be seven 
levels with 1,050 spaces, is said 
to 
improve 
patient, 
faculty 

and staff satisfaction on the 
Medical and Central campuses. 
According to the action request, 
currently employees are forced 
to park farther away from the 
hospital and walk or use other 
transportation 
methods. 
The 

project approval also authorizes 
Walker Parking Consultants to 
propose a design.

and the administration. The 
letter also addressed how 
ME/NA students are often 
forced to identify as white 
while filling out documents 
— a classification that fails to 
encompass their unique lived 
experiences in a post-9/11 
America.

“ME/NA 
students, 

constrained 
by 
Census 

categories, are expected to 
check the white identity box,” 
it reads. “However, many 
people of Middle Eastern 
and North African descent 
do not identify with or have 
the lived experiences of being 
white in the U.S., especially 
in a post-9/11 environment of 
anti-Arab and anti-Muslim 
racism. In addition, the lack 
of an identity box for U-M’s 
ME/NA students perpetuates 
the 
erasure 
that 
many 

marginalized 
communities 

experience. Given that we 
live in a state with the largest 
concentration 
of 
ME/NA 

individuals outside of the 
Middle East/North Africa, 
we have a unique regional 
responsibility to implement 
the 
ME/NA 
identity 

category.”

During the meeting, several 

students 
representing 
the 

#WeExist campaign shared 
their thoughts regarding why 
they believe the University 
should implement the ME/NA 

identity category. LSA senior 
Jad Elharake, one of the main 
organizers 
of 
#WeExist, 

emphasized the amount of 
work students and organizers 
have put into the campaign to 
draw attention to this lack of 
representation.

“For over a decade, ME/

NA students have raised the 
same issue, but our concerns 
were not prioritized or acted 
upon. However, in the past 
nine 
months, 
organizers 

have been working towards 
building 
unprecedented 

support on campus,” he said. 
“We 
unanimously 
passed 

resolutions 
and 
support 

statements in over 15 student 
governments.”

He further described the 

unique 
responsibility 
the 

University has to recognize 
ME/NA 
students, 
as 
the 

state of Michigan possesses 
the largest concentration of 
individuals that identify with 
this category outside of the 
Middle East and North Africa. 
A case studyconducted by 
the Arab American Institute 
reported 
the 
number 
of 

Michigan residents who claim 
an Arab ancestry has almost 
tripled since 1980.

“Given that we live in 

the state with the largest 
concentration 
of 
ME/NA 

individuals outside of the 
Middle 
East 
and 
North 

Africa,” he said. “U of M has a 
unique regional responsibility 
to implement the ME/NA 
identity category.”

Engineering junior Bassel 

Salka, co-president of the 
Arab 
Student 
Association, 

echoed Elharake’s enthusiasm 
regarding 
working 
with 

University 
faculty 
and 

administration to make the 
ME/NA identity category a 
reality.

“I was really happy to see 

the Middle Eastern and North 
African community unite over 
all three campuses on this 
project with overwhelming 
support from other groups 
and allies, this is something 
very special,” he said. “It will 
be great as an Arab myself to 
finally feel represented on 
this campus. Lastly, as for the 
concerns from the regents, the 
ME/NA community is excited 
to address those concerns and 
work together on achieving 
our goal.”

Despite 
multiple 
student 

speakers at the meeting, as 
well as University Regent Mark 
Bernstein 
(D), 
expressing 

enthusiasm regarding working 
with the campaign toward 
implementing the category, 
University 
Regent 
Andrea 

Fischer 
Newman 
(R) 
said 

she possesses concerns about 
making the change and would 
like further discussion before 
reaching a final decision.

“Just so we’re clear, and 

with all due respect to my 
colleague, I do have some 
concerns, and would like to 
have this discussion before 
coming to a conclusion,” she 
said. “I just want to make that 
clear, that there is a difference 
of opinion, potentially.”

Bristow sent to the University’s 
general counsel Timothy Lynch, 
which Bristow shared with the 
Detroit Free Press, one of the 
reasons they needed a response by 
Jan. 15 was so his team could bring 

Spencer’s supporters to the event.

“If a date between February 

24 and March 4, 2018, will work 
for Richard Spencer’s speech on 
campus, we will need to know 
sooner rather than later so that 
travel 
arrangements 
can 
be 

made for the numerous involved 
parties who will need to obtain 
airfare, 
lodging, 
and 
ground 

transportation,” Bristow wrote.

Considering he had extended 

the 
deadline 
for 
finalizing 

negotiations twice, Bristow said 
this was the final opportunity.

“There will be no further 

extensions of my client’s demand 
to 
be 
permitted 
to 
exercise 

his constitutional right to free 
speech,” Bristow said. “We’ve 
been patient, but our patience has 
its limits.”

the email read. “Every group 
on campus should have a 
voice. If one of us is silenced, 
we are all weaker for it.”

The listing for the associate 

director position was posted 
for three weeks on various 
job boards, including U-M 
Careers and the Chronicle of 
Higher Education. Numerous 
MESA 
administrators 
and 

Interim Director Linh Nguyen 
reviewed applications, and 
after 
conducting 
phone 

interviews, 
on-campus 

interviews were offered to 
several candidates — none of 
whom were Latino.

In an email, E. Royster 

Harper, the University’s vice 

president for student life, 
said student perspectives are 
“critical.”

“Student 
participation 

in the hiring process helps 
us identify candidates who 
embrace the goals of the office 
and carry them forward,” 
Harper said. “When we are at 
our best, we create a diverse 
candidate pool and work in 
partnership to identify strong 
candidates for any position.”

According 
to 
the 

University’s 
Enrollment 

Overview, the percentage of 
Latino students on campus 
has risen over the past several 
years; total enrollment of 
Hispanic students was just 
under 5 percent in fall 2013 
and 
has 
since 
grown 
to 

6.67 percent this past fall. 
However, 
the 
University 

currently has no deans or 

assistant 
deans 
from 
the 

Latino community.

Navarrete 
said 
the 

University must take steps to 
ensure Latinx candidates are 
notified about and considered 
for positions.

 
“The 
University 
should 

advertise positions towards 
Latinx professionals, because 
to accept a candidate pool 
with no Latinx candidates 
insinuates that the University 
believes our community is not 
capable of providing qualified 
leaders,” 
Navarrete 
said. 

“Being able to identify with 
faculty, staff, students and 
administrators who share our 
identity is crucial to allowing 
for genuine connections and 
providing an environment for 
the Latinx community that is 
inclusive and welcoming.”

people watched, sparing only 
the village’s church. Today, 
members of the Burt Lake Band 
are dispersed throughout the 
state of Michigan.

The 10,000-acre University 

Biological 
Station 
was 

established in 1909 to study 
environmental 
change. 
The 

University acquired the land 
from lumber barons after the 
trees were cleared, allowing 
students to study the fire-
ravaged 
environment. 
Since 

its 
conception, 
the 
forest 

has 
rejuvenated, 
providing 

a place for biological and 
environmental field work for 
students and faculty.

According to the request 

written by John M. Petoskey, 
an enrolled member of the 
Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa 
and Chippewa Indians, the 
Burt Lake Band of Odawa and 
Ojibwa people lived less than 
five miles from the current 
UMBS, which was established 
after the burnout. His request 
is threefold: that the University 

of Michigan create curriculum 
on the burnout for students 
who attend UMBS, to work 
with descendants of the Burt 
Lake Band to commemorate the 
burnout through a memorial at 
UMBS and that UMBS, Ecology 
and 
Evolutionary 
Biology 

and School for Environment 
and 
Sustainability 
include 

in its curriculum indigenous 
perspectives 
on 
resource 

management, 
environmental 

history, 
ecology 
and 

environmental justice.

LSA 
senior 
Elizabeth 

Michaelson 
spent 
three 

summers 
at 
UMBS 
taking 

classes 
and 
working. 
She 

studied 
freshwater 
ecology, 

forest ecology and soil samples 
from the region of the fire.

“It’s known, at the biological 

station, of Native American 
archaeological 
deposits 
or 

storage in the ground and the 
Native 
American 
presences 

(are) known and understood 
and somewhat talked about,” 
Michaelson said.

Michaelson could not recall 

whether she heard about the 
story of the Burt Lake Band 
burnout from sitting around the 

campfire or from those working 
at the UMBS. She recalls Native 
American tribal maps located 
at UMBS but said she did not 
know UMBS opened so recently 
following the fire.

“There is no way in this 

small quiet area that (the 
University) didn’t know about 
this,” Michaelson said. “I think 
that (Petoskey’s) requests from 
the biological station are very 
doable.”

Based on her experiences at 

the UMBS, Michaelson feels 
that UMBS would be receptive 
to Petoskey’s requests. She said 
UMBS cultivated community 
conversation 
about 
difficult 

topics that emotionally effect 
students.

“Through my summers at the 

bio station, whenever anything 
horrible 
or 
scary 
would 

happen, whether on campus 
or off, there would always be 
community conversation about 
what is happening and how we 
can move forward and support 
each other,” Michaelson said.

BIO
From Page 1

“I was getting pushed out 

of all the cool mechanical 
stuff,” Wightman said. “But 
there were always ‘reasonable 
explanations.’ One day all five 
girls (in the class) and I realized 
we were all getting the same 
‘reasonable 
expectations.’ 

So that’s when I first started 
noticing the gender differences.”

In the workplace, women 

often 
face 
sexism 
in 
the 

form of microaggressions or 
gender-based assumptions. For 

example, Wightman recalled 
her 
male 
colleagues 
being 

intimidated when she dressed 
professionally; a boss who told 
her she would never advance if 
she continued baking cookies 
for the office; she would go 
into 
interviews 
where 
the 

recruiters had assumed she was 
male based on the impressive 
credentials on her résumé.

Often one of few women in 

a predominantly male office, 
Wightman said her co-workers 
often aren’t aware of how 
offensive their statements could 
be, because nobody has been 
there to hold them accountable 
in the past. In addition to calling 

attention 
to 
these 
remarks 

outright, 
Wightman 
said 

another strategy she has found 
to be effective is to make them 
explain the reasoning behind 
their thought process.

“Sometimes people say things 

and they don’t even realize how 
sexist it is,” she said. “Someone 
will say something (sexist) 
and I’ll say, ‘Wait — I don’t 
understand how you got to that 
conclusion.’ When you make 
someone explain their biases, 
they start retreating.”

Siamof agreed.

Conyers, 
who 
was 
first 

elected to Congress in 1964, 
co-founded the Congressional 
Black Caucus and sponsored 
legislation to make Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day a federal 
holiday. Conyers also served 
as ranking Democrat on the 
House Judiciary Committee 
for many years and has been a 
principal supporter of single-
payer health care legislation. 
He has built a robust legacy 
as a champion of civil rights. 
The day before his retirement 
announcement, a rally in Detroit 
attended by local politicians, 
faith leaders and activists was 
held in support of Conyers and 
his status as an icon of the civil 
rights movement.

Despite his achievements, 

Conyers still abused his power 
as a government official and 
employer — actions we cannot 
condone. 
As 
his 
egregious 

actions have come to light, he 
can no longer be trusted to 
uphold important standards 
of conduct that we expect of 
any politician. Furthermore, 
in 2015, Conyers used $27,000 
of taxpayer money to settle a 
wrongful dismissal suit against 
a former employee who alleged 
she had been fired for resisting 
his sexual advances. While the 

use of taxpayer money for the 
settlement was entirely legal, 
we find this deeply unsettling.

While 
we 
live 
in 
an 

increasingly polarized political 
climate, party politics should 
not make a difference when 
addressing sexual harassment 
on Capitol Hill. We understand 
that seats in Congress can make 
or break important legislative 
initiatives, like we saw with the 
Republicans’ multiple failed 
attempts to reform health care. 
This issue, however, should not 
pose concern in Conyers’s case. 
Michigan’s 13th Congressional 
District, which he represented 
prior to his retirement, has 
historically voted democratic. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
issue 
of 

sexual misconduct in Congress 
is not one of politics, but of 
ethics. If the Democratic Party 
wishes to be the party that 
champions 
women’s 
rights, 

they must condemn sexual 
misconduct within their ranks 
— even with elected positions 
with tighter races.

This expectation goes beyond 

Conyers and includes Sen. Al 
Franken, D-Minn., who has been 
accused of sexual misconduct 
by eight women. There has been 
valid criticism concerning a dual 
standard shown by democratic 
leadership, 
one 
that 
favors 

Franken over Conyers. We would 
expect the same zero-tolerance 
policy 
from 
the 
Republican 

Party, 
particularly 
when 
it 

comes to Alabama senatorial 
candidate Roy Moore. Implicitly 
or explicitly supporting certain 
people 
accused 
of 
sexual 

misconduct while condemning 
others must stop.

With these allegations and 

his abrupt retirement, Conyers 
will now have a complex 
legacy. We must recognize and 
accept that people and their 
legacies can be complex. By 
looking past this complexity, 
we lose the accountability we 
need within our institutions. G

rowing 
up, 
we’re 

told that we can be 
anything. We’re taught 

to dream and imagine; we’re 
told that optimism beats realism 
every single time. Then we get 
older, and we start to lose sight 
of this idea. When we’re kids, 
we dream of being president. 
Yet when we inch closer to 
graduating from college and 
entering true adulthood, our 
most 
profound 
dreams 
are 

just that some company, any 
company, will hire us. 

This 
column 
isn’t 
about 

holding fast to dreams; it is 
more about how growing up, 
unfortunately, means realism and 
practicality overtake imagination 
and hopefulness. It’s not all bad, 
because I think most of us still 
hold a sense of optimism — it’s 
just less unbridled.

But 
isn’t 
this 
kind 
of 

peculiar? 
Societal 
norms 

seem to extinguish in adults 
the childhood idea that if you 
believe in yourself, you can do 
almost anything, and if enough 
people believe in something, it 
can be done.

I don’t plan to preach the 

benefits of dreaming big and 
never giving up. This isn’t 
a “hope-y, change-y” call to 
action. But it’s interesting that 
realism grows stronger as we 
grow up, because it is apparent 
that so many of the important 
things in the world function 
not because of anything real.

Let’s look at an example that 

we all know and love: money. 
Money in the United States is 
green paper. Again, it is paper. 
Paper that is colored green. So 
are the physical properties of 
this green paper what make 

it so valuable? Not at all. If I 
took a green colored pencil to a 
piece of loose leaf and handed 
it to you, you wouldn’t care.

Why? Money is valuable 

because everyone says it is. 
More 
accurately, 
everyone 

believes it is. It has no intrinsic 
worth 
in 
its 
chemical 
or 

physical structure.

So belief drives money, yet 

society tends to push people 
to be realistic, and, while not 
rejecting the benefits of belief, 
to focus more on action and 
pragmatism as life gets more 
complicated. My thinking is 
that we shouldn’t allow our 
kids to relinquish that youthful 
sense of belief.

Money and a variety of other 

things — the Federal Reserve, 
the U.S. government, human 
rights — are fictive constructs, 
not material truths. Of course 
there 
are 
Federal 
Reserve 

Bank buildings made of brick 
and mortar, and money is 
real paper that you can hold. 
These things do exist in the 
most 
elementary, 
physical 

forms. But their inherent value 
subsists only in our collective 

consciousness. Isn’t this naive 
and child-like?

So let’s not act like adults 

are so mature and perfectly 
realistic: They trade green slips 
of paper that they all agreed 
should have value. Then they 
use some of this paper to pay 
the government, because, well, 
everyone seems to think that’s 
how it should be. Some of them 
go to church every Sunday and 
worship things they have no 
idea actually exist. And nearly 
all of them, at least in the United 
States, preach that everyone 
has human rights, even though 
no doctor has ever performed 
surgery in which he cut open 
his patient and found the heart, 
blood vessels, large intestine, 
liver and … human rights.

It’s about time we regain 

a little bit of that childhood 
naivety — the kind that pushes 
you first to imagine, then to 
believe in yourself and in the 
notion that common beliefs are 
all we really need. Again, this 
isn’t all that much of a call to 
action. It is simply a plea to 
realize our hypocrisy: There is 
no reason we shouldn’t dream 
big and use our imaginations 
like children, throughout life. 
After all, we do it with money, 
government, religion and the 
economy.

So let’s try to always remember 

the power of collective beliefs. 
Let’s never encourage anyone to 
“grow up,” if all growing up means 
is relinquishing dreams because 
adulthood “realism” says they’re 
too imaginative and ambitious.

FROM THE DAILY

Hold harassers accountable
O

ver the past few weeks, U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich, 
has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple former 
employees. On Tuesday, Conyers sent a letter to Speaker of 

the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, 
D-Calif., and Gov. Rick Snyder announcing his retirement effective 
immediately. He made the same announcement in a radio interview 
while also denying the accusations against him. His retirement 
came after multiple politicians on both sides of the aisle called for 
him to step down. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board believes our 
government officials must be held accountable for their actions 
regardless of the standing of their character and career.

into my brain, permanently I think. 
No matter how hard I try to forget, 
I don’t know if I ever will.

In the years since it happened, 

when I find myself gripped with 
panic and unable to catch my 
breath, I calm down by reasoning 
with myself. Mine wasn’t that bad 
because, thank God, I can’t even 
remember most of it. Some women 
have more violent memories. I’m 
one of the lucky ones, really. But 
how could I ever forget the part I 
did remember? It flashes into my 
mind at random times, and always 
before I go to sleep.

It’s been three years since I was 

raped. Those three years have been 
some of the longest of my life. It 
took me a year to admit to myself 
that what happened that night was 
actually rape. It took even longer 
for me to tell my parents. I can 
count on one hand the number of 
my friends I have told. To this day, 
I keep it to myself out of shame and 
fear of how I will be perceived.

We all know how people react 

when a woman seeks justice, or 
even solace, following a rape. What 
was she wearing? She has no proof. 
Why would she want to ruin a 
man’s life like that? Questions like 
these had me convinced for a long 
time that what happened to me was 
my fault. I did go to his house, after 
all. I was even wearing a dress. So, 
I allowed the shame I felt to take 
hold of my body. It gripped me 
so tightly it made it impossible to 
speak, even when I wanted to tell 
people what happened to me.

Everyone who knows me 

knows 
I’m 
an 
outspoken 

feminist — I’m never afraid to 
address the injustices that exist 
in our society. I have supported 
many of my friends who have 
experienced the same injustice 
as I have. I assure them that 
what happened to them was 
not a result of their actions or 
words; the horrific denial of 
their autonomy and disregard 
for their humanity was not 
their fault. And I believe that 

wholeheartedly. I would fight 
for any victim. So why couldn’t 
I fight for myself?

Over the past month or so, I have 

read hundreds of posts associated 
with the #MeToo campaign. I’m 
encouraged by survivors who 
speak out about what was done 
to them. I admire their bravery. 
Reading other women recount 
their stories and their recoveries 
gives me hope that I, too, will be 
able to recover one day.

However, campaigns like these, 

which are designed to increase 
awareness, feel empty at best 
and insulting at worst. I was not 
surprised by any of the posts I 
read or even the sheer number 
of my friends alone who have 
experienced sexual assault. This is 
common knowledge to me and to 
every woman I know.

What surprised me was how 

men reacted: I had no idea sexual 
assault was this widespread! What 
can we, as men, do to stop this?! 
Women of the world, help us be 
better! As if women don’t have 
enough to deal with already, now 
we must fix the problem of sexual 
assault, too? To me, “the problem 
of sexual assault” is really “the 
problem of men who do not know 
women deserve respect and dignity 
just like everybody else.” It’s “the 
problem of toxic masculinity and 
the patriarchy” or, more simply, 
“the problem of power.”

I realized this long before I 

was raped, and my understanding 
certainly didn’t require having 
a daughter or a wife first. Like 
many women I know, I’m tired of 
facilitating the conversation on 
sexual assault. But, for the sake of 
change, I will. Men reading this, 
listen up.

I implore you to understand 

that even if you have not sexually 
assaulted 
someone, 
you 
are 

complicit in sexual assault in 
your silence. You are complicit 
in the rape jokes you make with 
your friends. You are complicit 
when you willingly participate in 
organizations where sexual assault 
rates are highest, like fraternities. 
Please understand how destructive 
your behavior is to women, to men, 
to yourself and to society.

If you are offended by my claims, 

all you need to do is tune into the 
conversation women have been 
having for decades. For too long, 
the blame and responsibility have 
been placed on women. It is not our 
job to stop what is being done to 
us. We do not need to be less naive, 
more careful or more accepting of 
the “reality” of our world. Men, you 

need to step up. This is not on me. 
This is on you.

Beyond 
ensuring 
that 
it 

never happens again, men can 
help fix “the problem of sexual 
assault” by addressing the role 
they play in its perpetuation. 
Chris Brown, abuser, has a 
new documentary on Netflix. 
Kodak Black, rapist, continues 
to be a widely streamed artist. 
Woody Allen, pedophile and 
rapist, decorates the walls of 
our “progressive” town of Ann 
Arbor. Donald Trump, alleged 
rapist, is the president of the 
United States. The list goes 
on. Stop celebrating, glorifying 
and rewarding these men and, 
instead, hold them accountable.

You can also help by being 

supportive of the people in your 
life who have been raped. When I 
told my dad what happened to me, 
he listened to me. He allowed me 
to share my experience without 
interrupting or interjecting his 
own thoughts. Most importantly, 
he did not doubt me for a second. 
The positive impact of having a 
man like my dad in my life during 
my recovery process has been 
immeasurable. I encourage you to 
be that man for someone. Listen, 
actually listen, to the women, and 
men, in your life who want to share 
their experiences.

For a long time after I was raped, 

I felt helpless. I still have days when 
I feel things will never change. 
But my helplessness no longer 
consumes me. I’m inspired and 
comforted by the resilient, brave 
women in my life. To the women 
in my classes who excel despite 
their trauma, to my friends and 
family who carry on despite what 
was done to them, to survivors 
everywhere: I see you, I believe you 
and I believe in you.

Women are strong as hell. But 

we shouldn’t have to be. No, the 
solution to “the problem of sexual 
assault” is not women becoming 
stronger and less sensitive. The 
solution is for men to stop. Stop. 
Raping. Us. Though I’m tired 
of being held responsible, I will 
continue to fight for justice until 
men no longer feel they possess the 
right to my body. I will fight for me. 
I will fight for you.

‘Easy’ is isn’t alway easy 

Even as it enters its second 

season, “Easy” remains one of 
the year’s most underrated and 
overlooked TV displays amidst 
the flood of fresh Netflix originals. 
The anthology — with each 
episode 
presenting 
different, 

individualistic 
characters 
and 

storylines — continues on to 
explore more diverse Chicagoans 
and their experimentation in the 
realms of business, romance and 
culture. Whether it be trying out 
an open marriage, broadening 
entrepreneurial 
endeavours 

or raising an angsty teen, the 
experiences within the show 
are 
extremely 
approachable. 

After a binge-watch of season 
two, it is evident that much of 
the allure of the series is due to 
writer and director, Joe Swanberg 
(“Drinking Buddies”), who fuses 
his indie, improvisational and 
highly unconventional structure 
with captivating and introspective 
character development.

I have to admit that at first 

glance, “Easy” had me feeling the 
opposite of what the title implies. 
I was confused and somewhat 
uncomfortable, not quite sure how 
to approach the mumblecore vibes, 
ever-changing plot and overall 
unpredictability of the show. The 
characters talk over one another, 
the tone is almost too relaxed and 
conversational, and the situations 
that the various personalities are 
dealing with come off as somehow 
intensely serious and humorous at 
the same time.

But after a few more vignette-

style episodes, I came to accept 
that my very uneasiness is an 
integral element of the show’s 
intent. 
The 
spontaneity 
and 

tackling of ultra-contemporary 
issues like sexuality, status and 
race are what give “Easy” its 
honesty. The way that I became 
invested in new characters who 
then disappeared after a mere 

30-minutes left me hoping for 
the expansion and elaboration of 
certain stories into stand-alone 
pieces.

It must be said, however, that not 

all of the episodes and stories had 
as equal an impact and intrigue 
to them. The significance of each 
episode was entirely dependant on 
how devoted I was to the featured 
personas and scenarios. While 
some of the stories picked up as a 
continuation of season one, most 
were unfamiliar and innovative, 
allowing similar opportunities 
for a sparked interest. The most 

entertaining 
and 
compelling 

episodes of “Easy” were the ones 
that 
highlighted 
experiences 

that I could envision myself 
encountering in real life, which 
prompted the self-investigation of, 
“How would I handle this?”

Hands 
down 
the 
funniest 

episode of the season is the first, 
where a group of dynamic and 
hyperbolized suburban couples 
form a neighborhood watch to 
catch a package thief. Though 
simple in plot, the focus on 
mob mentality, or how one’s 
perspective can sway the group’s, 
and 
Aubrey 
Plaza’s 
(“Parks 

and 
Recreation”) 
subsequent 

unconvinced and unimpressed 
facial expressions are enough 
comedic payoff in themselves.

In fact, the genuine and palpable 

acting within “Easy” is one of its 
greatest successes, as this season 
spotlights 
some 
Hollywood 

geniuses like Joe Lo Truglio 
(“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine”), 
Judy 

Greer (“Arrested Development”), 
Zazie 
Beetz 
(“Atlanta”) 
and 

stand-up comedian Kate Berlant 
among 
others. 
These 
actors 

take on roles of various races, 
ethnicities, 
sexualities, 
ages 

and professions, and they lend a 
real authenticity and normalcy 
to diversity and difference. In 
a time when diversity in media 
is so often included to “check 
boxes” of character variety, the 
character portrayals in “Easy” 
never appear forced or unnatural, 
remaining legitimate and relatable 
throughout countless storylines.

It becomes evident that the 

premise of “Easy” is not to feel 
content after each episode wraps 
up (even though each story 
does culminate with some sort 
of conclusion), but to continue 
wondering about the trials and 
tribulations of others, and maybe 
even look at your own life with a 
different lens. The show teaches 
compassion and consideration for 
those around you, especially those 
who may look or seem different, 
and to acknowledges that not all of 
life’s situations have an immediate 
happy ending. This underlying 
message is not only comforting 
and surprisingly uplifting, but is 
extremely relevant and necessary 
in today’s often idealized society.

Season two of “Easy” reveals 

that aside from what it seems, life 
is not, in fact, always easy. The 
series represents a mishmash 
of 
varying 
personas 
and 

perspectives and consequently 
leaves viewers with a mishmash 
of feelings and emotions, which 
interact 
in 
an 
uninterrupted 

and natural way. “Easy” breaks 
down the reserved sheltered 
way that traditional comedy-
dramas portray sex, romance 
and money-making, and is a hit 
with millennials because of that 
candor. With seemingly endless 
scenarios that future storylines 
could follow, I’m hopeful that the 
series will return with a season 
three and continuing inquiring 
upon the often untold truths of 
our types of diverse and dynamic 
people.

Bach Collegium Japan 
bring Christmas to Hill

The 
classical 
sounds 
of 

Christmas will be coming to Ann 
Arbor tonight.

The Bach Collegium Japan is an 

ensemble that was started in 1990 
by Masaaki Suzuki, founder and 
musical director of the group. They 
will perform J.S. Bach’s Christmas 
Oratorio, which is split up in parts 
that celebrate the major feasts of 
Christmas time. Bach Collegium 
Japan will perform parts, one, 
two, three and six. 

“I think people will enjoy the 

variety of expression of the music, 
as well as experience the story 
of Christmas time,” said Suzuki 
in an interview with The Daily. 
“I’m hoping to show a connection 
between 
Christmas 
and 
the 

passion chorale.”

The passion chorale appears at 

the beginning and ending of the 
Christmas Oratorio, and Suzuki 
finds it to be one of the most 
interesting aspects of Bach’s piece.

Bach has always played a huge 

influence 
on 
Suzuki’s 
music 

work. The Bach Collegium Japan 
started as a small choir, which 
later expanded and gave him the 
chance to perform some of his 
works.

Suzuki has established himself 

as an outstanding conductor, 
organist, 
harpsichordist 
and 

leading 
authority 
on 
Bach. 

Suzuki 
has 
guest 
conducted 

the New York Philharmonic, 
Boston Symphony Orchestra, San 
Francisco Symphony and more. 
He was awarded with the Leipzig 
Bach Medal in 2012, the Royal 
Academy of Music Bach Prize in 
2013 and the Das Verdienstkreuz 
am Bande des Verdienstordens der 
Bundesrepublik from Germany in 
2001. The Bach Collegium Japan 

has also won several awards, 
including the 45th Suntory Music 
Prize and the Echo Classical 
Music Prize in 2014.

Understandably, 
Bach 
has 

played a major role in Suzuki’s 
musical career. Suzuki noted 
that Bach’s music has a universal 
appeal to it, as it has the ability 
for everyone to understand the 
emotions and moods it attempts to 
portray.

“Music is very powerful and 

dense in its structure,” Suzuki 

said. “It speaks to me very 
strongly. The three dimensions 
built into Bach’s oratorio — the 
biblical text, chorale movements 
and congregational singing — will 
give the show a lot of variety and 
power.”

The ensemble has also recorded 

Bach’s 
complete 
cantatas 
in 

chronological order, an enormous 
project that spanned from 1995 
to 2013. Receiving high praise 
internationally, their work has not 
gone unnoticed. They have also 
recorded works by other classical 
composers, such as Beethoven’s 
ninth symphony and Mozart’s 
“Requiem.”

The Bach Collegium Japan 

brings 
together 
musicians 

worldwide for its performances, 
coming from America, Europe and 
Japan. The ensemble performs 
all over the world and regularly 
in their home country’s cities of 
Tokyo, Kobe and Nagoya.

“We work on a project basis, so 

every time we come back together 
it’s a reunion,” Suzuki said. 
“Especially with the spirit and 
theme of Christmas time, it’ll be a 
very happy atmosphere for us.”

Suzuki is also a principal 

guest conductor of Yale Schola 
Cantorum and was on the choral 
conducting faculty at the Yale 
School of Music and Yale Institute 
of Sacred Music from 2009 to 2013.

Suzuki and the rest of his 

ensemble 
keep 
Bach’s 
music 

and spirit alive through their 
dedication and hard work.

Russian Classical Ballet to 
perform ‘The Nutcracker’

Like it or hate it, the holiday 

season is undeniably upon us. A 
walk down Main Street offers 
proof of this: Bright lights wrap 
themselves gracefully around 
trees, Christmas carols ring 
from inviting Kerrytown shops 
and couples walk hand-in-hand 
with a seemingly newfound 
sense of happiness.

If you’re like me and love 

the 
spontaneous 
comradery 

that springs up during this 
time of year, or just need a 
way to escape the mounting 
stress of finals, you’re in luck. 
The classic holiday special 
“The Nutcracker” will make a 
reappearance this Saturday at 
the Michigan Theater

This performance of “The 

Nutcracker” is presented by the 
Academy of Russian Classical 
Ballet, 
based 
in 
Wixom, 

Michigan. The Academy is 
made up of talented ballet 
students from Michigan and 
Ohio who learn the traditional 
Vaganova (Russian) style of 
classical ballet. The Academy 
also 
holds 
a 
Professional 

Trainee Program for students 
intending to pursue ballet as a 
profession.

This is the third time the 

Academy will perform “The 
Nutcracker” 
at 
Michigan 

Theater, and they intend to 
keep 
the 
performance 
as 

close to the Russian Bolshoi 
Ballet Company’s rendition as 
possible.

As a way to follow the 

original ballet, this particular 
rendition 
doesn’t 
“have 
a 

specific wooden Nutcracker 
doll. We have a younger dancer 
who performs the role,” said 
co-director of the Academy 
Jessica 
Morschakov 
in 
an 

interview with the Daily.

The dancers are excited 

that their version of “The 

Nutcracker” stands out from 
other modern interpretations. 
“For the Spanish (corps), it’s 
really interesting to do the 
original choreography rather 
than something newer,” said 
Nina Schotland, a dancer in 
the Spanish dance sequence. 
Schotland, an LSA freshman, 
performs in the Waltz of the 
Flowers and in the Spanish 
corps as a soloist, in addition to 
other roles.

Professional ballet dancers 

from Moscow Ballet in Russia 
will join the cast of local 
ballet students on Saturday. 
“Our young Clara and young 
Nutcracker 
are 
Michigan 

students,” Morschakov said. 
After Clara, the main child 
protagonist of the play, enters 
her dreamland, the Nutcracker 
is 
transformed 
into 
a 

handsome prince. The Russian 
professionals will perform “the 
grown-up version of Clara and 
the Prince.”

Tchaikovsky’s 
score 
for 

“The Nutcracker” is timeless, 
even for the dancers who’ve 
performed 
it 
many 
times 

before. “I listen to it a lot. I 
wake up to it,” said Luke Eller. 
Eller will play the role of the 
Fritz, Clara’s mean brother and 
the Nutcracker in the first act, 
among others.

‘Mrs. Maisel’ stands out 
with lovable protagonist

New York City in the ’50s was 

truly a time. The cars were gaudy, 
the clothes were lavish and the 
women were confined to the 
domestic sphere, subordinate to 
their husbands. It was a lifestyle 
few dared to question, and for 
a while, Midge Maisel (Rachel 
Brosnahan, “Patriots Day”) was 
among the compliant.

Midge is the ideal housewife. 

She measures herself every day to 
ensure she keeps up her figure. She 
waits to take her makeup off until 
her husband is asleep, and she has 
it back on by the time he wakes 
up. She supports her husband’s 
hopeless side job as a comedian, 
even bribing club owners with 
homemade brisket to get him the 
best time slot. The world according 
to Midge is perfect, and for the first 
30 minutes of the Amy Sherman-
Palladino 
(“Gilmore 
Girls”) 

comedy, it seems like things are 
going to stay that way.

But 
“The 
Marvelous 
Mrs. 

Maisel” 
would 
not 
be 
the 

unsuspecting gem that it is if our 
title character did nothing, well, 
marvelous. Though her quick 
wits and thick vintage New York 
accent are charming, the moment 
you fall in love with Midge is the 
moment her life falls apart. After 
her husband Joel (Michael Zegen, 

“Brooklyn”) admits to an affair 
with his secretary and leaves her, 
Midge downs a bottle of red wine 
and drunkenly taxis to the club 
that she would usually attend to 
watch Joel do his (stolen) comedy 
routine. With her makeup running 
and her usually-compact physique 
bloating, Midge turns the story 
of the worst day of her life into 

a uproarious comedy routine, 
one that catches the attention of 
both the star-spotting bartender 
and the policemen that cart her 
away for public indecency. It’s a 
sharp departure from the pastel 
and pristine homemaker we’d 
seen before, but one that propels 
the episode and the series into 
something worth watching.

“Marvelous” hits that sweet 

spot between funny and touching 
that so many comedies try yet fail 
to achieve. And at a time when 
our male comedic heroes are 
dropping one by one, the magic 
of “Marvelous” is crusaded by 
women, from the writers behind 
the scenes to the actresses lighting 

up our screens. Midge is not a 
housewife in need of saving: She is 
painted as a strong female whether 
she’s making latkes or pursuing 
stardom as a potential stand-up 
comedian. She reeks confidence 
so much that it leaps off the screen 
and fills the viewer with assurance 
that absolutely nothing will ever 
stop this woman.

It’s rare to find a show in which 

not a single aspect feels wrong or 
out-of-place, but “Marvelous” is 
truly about as flawless as a show 
of its genre can get. Everything 
from the upbeat, retro soundtrack 
to the pleasing aesthetics of old-
time New York to the lovable 
banter between Upper West Side 
Midge and take-no-shit Susie 
(Alex Borstein, “Family Guy”) 
crafts a show that is worthy of 
nothing but praise. Best of all, 
“Marvelous” is just a lot of fun to 
watch. Viewers are treated to the 
story of a bad-ass Jewish woman 
who finally comes into her own 
all while making unlikely friends, 
fighting off an unworthy ex 
and breaking into the comedy 
industry, an industry which, to 
this day, is dominated by men. 
It’s enough to inspire you to 
dump your lowly lover or write 
that book you keep putting off 
until tomorrow. Or, at the very 
least, down a glass or two of red 
wine and share your secrets with 
the world. You never know who 
might be listening.

Comic Broussard wants 
to make you laugh & think

When people think of what 

Ann Arbor is known for, things 
like academics, sports and culture 
usually come to mind. Most of the 
time, Ann Arbor’s comedy scene is 
left behind in comparison, forced 
to fight for some recognition. 
However, with historic venues 
like the Ann Arbor Comedy 
Showcase, bringing in comedians 
like Matthew Broussard, the scene 
seems to actually be thriving, and 
not just surviving, despite the lack 
of attention.

Founded almost 34 years ago, the 

venue opened when comedy clubs 
weren’t really that common.

“It was really the beginning 

of this industry, there weren’t 
that many comedy clubs across 
the country before 1980,” said 
cofounder Roger Feeny in an 
interview with The Daily.

Since then, the club has really 

built a name for itself, which is 
why it’s able to bring in such big 
name comics, including Matthew 
Broussard. Broussard’s witty style 
of comedy is a perfect fit for the 
crowds of Ann Arbor.

“They’re a smart crowd,” Feeny 

explained. “They’re very intelligent 
and very up on their popular culture, 
which brings us to Matthew.”

Not only are Broussard’s jokes 

clever, but he also has the brains 
— and a degree — to accompany 
them. Before pursuing his career 
in standup, Broussard completed 
a degree in mathematics at Rice 
University. 
After 
college, 
he 

moved to Los Angeles to pursue 
the strategic art of making people 
laugh.

And this decision seems to have 

been a good one for him. Since 

moving to LA, Broussard has been 
featured on programs like Conan 
and Comedy Central, as well as 
a variety of other TV shows and 
movies.

Even though he’s strayed a bit 

from his mathematical background, 
these skills have actually been able 

to help Broussard with his routines, 
weaving their way into his jokes 
from time to time.

“Joke writing itself is about 

finding patterns and breaking 
them,” Broussard said in a phone 
interview with The Daily. “And 
having a background in math really 
helps with that kind of analytical 
thinking.

And while his main goal is to 

get a laugh from the audience, he 
also likes making them think. “I 
enjoy a joke where you laugh, but 

after the show, you realize you 
now know a little tid-bit you didn’t. 
You can maybe one-up people in a 
conversation at a party when people 
ask where … Propecia comes from,” 
Broussard explained.

But his jokes aren’t purely 

academic. Broussard also draws 
upon observational humor and 
references to pop culture.

“I just want to address this up 

top: I look like a douchebag,” he 
said on a recent stand-up he gave on 
Conan last year. “It’s not a joke, I just 
want to let you know that I know… 
I’ve seen mirrors, I know that even 
before I started talking, most of 
you didn’t like me. And that’s okay, 
because ’80s movies have taught 
you to not trust someone with my 
hair and bone structure.”

While his jokes have found 

success 
in 
the 
mainstream, 

Feeny believes that they resonate 
particularly well with Ann Arbor 
audiences.

“Talking about smart audiences, 

Matthew touches on subjects that 
you never hear comics touch on, 
like physics and grammar,” Feeny 
stated. “You wouldn’t expect these 
bits to be funny. But the first time he 
came in, he impressed us greatly.”

Feeny attributes his success here 

to the fact that the club draws in 
such a smart audience.

Even though it’s a bit colder 

than Los Angeles, Broussard still 
looks forward to coming back 
to Ann Arbor for a second time. 
When asked about Ann Arbor and 
the Comedy Showcase, Broussard 
stated: “It’s one of my favorite 
clubs. The crowds are just so smart, 
and they’ll go anywhere with you. 
They’re far smarter than I am, and 
far more educated than I am. It’s 
really a treat. My favorite things is a 
smart audience, and Ann Arbor has 
that.”

NEW LINE CINEMA

‘Elf’ is peak Christmas

Over the course of November, 

I was subjected to “A Bad Mom’s 
Christmas,” “Daddy’s Home 2” 
and “The Star” in rapid succession. 
These movies have two things 
in common. One, they are all 
ostensibly Christmas movies. Two, 
they’re all godawful, poorly written 
messes made with all the thoughtful 
consideration of a Christmas card 
with your name spelled wrong. 
When the best movie of any given 
bunch costars Mel Gibson as a hot 
shot former astronaut who has to 
learn to say “I love you” to his son, 
it’s enough for even Santa to let out 
a “Humbug.”

That’s part of the reason I was 

so excited for this Thanksgiving 
Break. Not only would I be able to 
spend time with family and gorge 
myself on buttery dinner rolls, but 
my family would be beginning our 
holiday season as always: watching 
Jon Favreau’s (“Iron Man”) “Elf.” 
Having grown up with the movie, 
I’ve always had an appreciation 
for it that, as I grew older, perhaps 
could have been chalked up to 
simple nostalgia.

There was something different 

when I sat down to watch “Elf” 
this time, though. Maybe it was 
the string of duds I was coming off 
enduring. Maybe it was the aligning 
of the sun and stars. Maybe it was 
the eggnog. Whatever the reason, 

halfway through the movie, I had to 
a realization. This wasn’t just a good 
Christmas movie. For increasingly 
cynical times, “Elf” is just about 
the most perfect Christmas movie 
imaginable. There’s an earnestness, 
heart and imagination to every 
frame that is almost unmatched.

At the center of it all is Will 

Ferrell as Buddy the Elf, one of 
the best roles of his career. Ferrell 
has made a career out of playing 
man-children 
in 
movies 
like 

“Anchorman” 
and 
“Talladega 

Nights,” so the role of Buddy — a 
human raised by Santa’s elves 
— is perfect for him. But where 
parts like Ron Burgundy relied 
on audiences laughing at his more 
juvenile moments, the abject glee of 
Ferrell’s performance here makes it 
feel much more like we’re laughing 
with him. Even jokes that shouldn’t 
work, like an eleven-second long 
monster of a belch, do because of 
Buddy’s enthusiasm and Ferrell’s 
spot-on comedic timing.

Also key is Favreau in the 

director’s chair, wisely not allowing 
real world logic to get in the 
way of the story he’s telling. It’s 
a world where the North Pole is 
portrayed as a partially animated 
wonderland 
filled 
with 
stop-

motion arctic puffins. Heavy use 
of forced perspective is used to 
allow for Ferrell to tower over the 
other elves in indoor sets that do 
terrific worldbuilding all on their 
own. There’s an obvious contrast 
between this world and New York 
City, but Favreau finds the perfect 

balance between the two tones.

He also makes sure to ground 

everything 
in 
Buddy’s 
story. 

The job woes of Buddy’s father, 
Walter (a perfectly deadpan James 
Caan, “Cloudy with a Chance of 
Meatballs”) is something any of last 
month’s movies would have built 
entire agonizing scenes around. 
Here, they’re kept short and even 
add to the emotional heart of the 
film. There’s a thankful lack of 
dated references, as well, that’s 
positively refreshing given more 
recent comedies. Yes, “Daddy’s 
Home 2,” I’m sure all those “Sully” 
references will play just as well in 14 
years as they do now.

But eventually, it all comes back 

to the heart of it. Buddy the Elf lives 
in a cynical world. The children’s 
books 
executives 
are 
money-

grubbing jerks. Santa Claus (Ed 
Asner, “Up”) has become reliant on 
technology instead of Christmas 
spirit and, in a hilarious bit of 
implied backstory, has had at least 
one run-in with the Central Park 
Rangers. There’s no singing in the 
North Pole. It’s a world just like ours. 
There’s a certain catharsis, then, to 
watching Buddy’s optimism slowly 
win over everyone around him. The 
finale, bolstered by John Debney’s 
(“The Jungle Book”) terrific score, 
is nothing short of magical, and in 
a time when even Christmas feels 
in danger of succumbing to the 
monotonous daily grind of modern 
living, that little bit of magic and 
spirit “Elf” offers is something to 
hold onto.

2017 Season in Review: Defensive backs

With the Michigan football 

team’s 2017 regular season in 
the books, the Daily looks back 
at the performance of each unit 
this year and looks ahead to the 
future in 2018. In this edition: 
defensive backs.

The 
performance 
of 
the 

secondary might be the biggest 
surprise of the season for the 
Wolverines.

For a unit that lost both of 

its starting cornerbacks and 
safeties — all of whom were 
seniors — coming into this year, 
it would have been expected 
for Michigan’s pass defense to 
take a step back. The apparent 
successors 
were 
a 
trio 
of 

sophomores and a junior who 
had taken few, if any snaps, 
for the Wolverines before this 
season began.

But the quartet of defensive 

backs — cornerbacks Lavert 
Hill 
and 
David 
Long 
and 

safeties 
Josh 
Metellus 
and 

Tyree Kinnel — outperformed 
expectations in 2017, and then 
some.

Despite 
being 
thrust 

into starting roles, all four 
looked like veterans, both as 
individuals and a unit. But 
the most veteran member of 
the core, Kinnel, had the best 
season.

Kinnel 
excelled 
in 
his 

free safety role, racking up a 
whopping 67 tackles — five 
more than sophomore defensive 
end Rashan Gary — including 
4.5 for loss. He tallied a career-
high 11 of those tackles in one 
game against Minnesota, in 
which he led the team in the 
category with seven solo stops.

His 
strongside 
partner, 

Metellus, wasn’t far behind 
with 49 tackles of his own. 
He 
and 
Kinnel 
spent 
the 

year shutting down opposing 
receivers, combining for 12 pass 
breakups. Metellus also forced 

a fumble in the season opener 
against Florida.

The duo of Hill and Long 

proved to be reliable forces 
as well, recording 24 and 20 
tackles, 
respectively. 
They 

came up only one short in 
the pass breakups category, 
tallying 11, and also had two 
interceptions 
apiece. 
Kinnel 

had a pair of picks as well, and 
only Metellus was shut out in 
that regard.

For 
much 
of 
the 
year, 

Michigan 
boasted 
the 
top-

ranked 
secondary 
in 
the 

nation based on team passing 
efficiency 
defense. 
The 

Wolverines 
are 
currently 

third, behind Wisconsin and 
Alabama, with a rating of 100.17 
— just the Badgers and Crimson 
Tide have maintained double-
digit ratings over the course of 
the whole season.

Michigan, 
though, 
has 

allowed 
the 
least 
opposing 

passing yards in the country 
with a total of 1712, an average 
of just 142.66 per game. By 
comparison, 
Wisconsin 
and 

Alabama have allowed 2088 
and 
1964 
yards 
through 

the 
air, 
respectively. 
The 

Wolverines have also given up 
just nine touchdowns on the 
year while accumulating nine 
interceptions.

HIGH POINT: Michigan’s 

secondary put together multiple 
standout games this season, but 
the two that stand out the most 
are the Wolverines’ matchups 
with Cincinnati in September 
and Maryland in November. 

The common thread between 

both contests is the sheer 
number of pass attempts from 
both opposing quarterbacks, in 
contrast to the lack of success 
they found moving the ball 
through the air.

While both signal callers 

— Cincinnati’s Hayden Moore 
and Maryland’s Ryan Brand 
— threw for 132 and 136 yards, 
respectively, it took them 15 and 
16 passes apiece to reach that 
figure. Worse yet, Moore and 
Brand threw the ball 40 and 
35 times, respectively, on those 
days — good for completion 
rates well below 50 percent.

To add insult to injury, 

Michigan 
picked 
off 
both 

quarterbacks twice in those 
contests. Kinnel and Hill came 
up with the first set against 
the Bearcats, while Long and 
sophomore 
VIPER 
Khaleke 

Hudson came up with the other 
pair against the Terrapins.

LOW POINT: While the 

Wolverines recorded four picks 
in those two games, they came 
up with just five more in their 
10 other contests.

For a secondary with as much 

talent as Michigan has, that 
number should be much higher. 
The other teams in the country 
ranked near the Wolverines in 
pass defense have interception 
totals well into double-digit 
territory.

Throughout 
the 
year, 

Michigan struggled with the 
turnover battle, as its offense 
ran into trouble finding a 
consistent 
rhythm. 
While 

the defense can only save the 
offense to a point, there were 
certainly opportunities for the 
secondary to lend a helping 
hand, 
but 
untimely 
drops 

seemed to be a consistent theme 
for the Wolverines’ back four.

The most significant came in 

the second quarter against Ohio 
State when Michigan had a 
14-0 lead. Buckeye quarterback 
J.T. Barrett telegraphed a pass 
to Metellus, but the safety 
couldn’t come up with it and 

Ohio State scored on the next 
play to kick off its comeback.

THE 
FUTURE: 
The 

Wolverines 
will 
have 
the 

benefit of all four starters 
returning to the team in 2018. 
With a year of experience under 
their belts now, it isn’t far-
fetched to expect that Kinnel, 
Metellus, Hill and Long will 
be even better in their second 
go-around.

The biggest loss will be 

senior 
cornerback 
Brandon 

Watson, 
who 
served 
as 
a 

backup-turned-starter 
after 

Hill’s concussion injury late 
in the year. But Michigan has 
plenty of young defensive backs 
coming up the ranks.

Freshmen J’Marick Woods, 

Ambry Thomas and Benjamin 
St-Juste, as well as senior 
Jordan Glasgow, are all in line 
for playing time as part of the 
second unit next season, which 
means the secondary should 
be in good hands for the near 
future.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ to take on UCLA

Once again, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team is in 
need of a bounce back. 

Last 
week, 
after 
being 

trounced by North Carolina, 
the Wolverines (1-1 Big Ten, 
6-3 
overall) 
recuperated 

with a win over Indiana to 
regain some 
positive 
momentum.

Monday, 

that 
semblance of 
momentum 
came 
to 
a 

screeching 
halt. 
Michigan 
jumped 
out 

to a 20-point 
lead 
over 

Ohio 
State 

before 
watching 
it 

evaporate 
into thin air 
in an eventual nine-point loss. 
With the result, the issues that 
plagued the Wolverines in 
Chapel Hill resurfaced. They 
still don’t have a clear answer 
for their opponent’s best shot. 
And it still isn’t clear who 
will step up when they need a 
basket.

“We did a lot, again, of what 

we did in the North Carolina 
game and the LSU game,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
after his team’s loss to the 
Buckeyes. “When things got 
a little tough, we really had 
trouble stepping up. So it’s 
a big area we’ve got to work 
at. We’ve got to somehow 
get them to understand the 
importance 
(that), 
at 
that 

time, people do embrace that 
part of the game and get it 
done.” 

Now, the Wolverines will 

welcome UCLA to Ann Arbor 
on Saturday. And though the 
Bruins have played a relatively 
easy schedule so far, their 7-1 
record and status as a marquee 
program is enough to provide 
a stout test for Michigan.

UCLA – which was No. 21 in 

the AP Preseason rankings – is 
led by guard Aaron Holliday. 
Holliday is averaging 16.5 
points per game and 5.5 assists 
per game, and the junior is the 
Bruins’ go-to player.

Beyond Holliday, freshman 

guard 
Jaylen 
Hands 
has 

shown himself to be a lethal 
offensive threat, particularly 
from beyond the arc. Hands 
has shot 50 percent from deep, 
and while it’s a limited sample 
size, the rookie’s 12.9 points 
per game have made him a 
viable weapon.

Despite UCLA’s preseason 

ranking, it has disappointed 
slightly so far this season. In 
the Bruins’ first game, they 
barely 
edged 
out 
Georgia 

Tech, were taken to overtime 
by Central Arkansas and beat 
a bad Wisconsin team by just 
three points. On top of that, 
they have a loss to Creighton, 
and off-the-court issues led 
to the suspension of three of 
their players. It has been a 
tumultuous start to the season 
for UCLA to say the least.

Even still, Michigan will 

have its hands full Saturday. 
Holliday is one of the best 
players the Wolverines will 
face all season, and their 
current rut won’t make it 
easier to take on one of the 
better teams in the country.

Don’t 
expect 
Michigan 

to figure everything out in 
one game, though. Beilein 
said Monday that the season 
would be “a journey” until the 
younger players grow and the 
older players step up. But he 
does take some of the blame 
for himself. He sees his team’s 
inability to step up in crunch 
time as his own shortcoming.

“We just have to continue 

to toughen up,” Beilein said. 
“Get some – what does Jim 
Harbaugh say? Get some steel 
in our spine when things are 
tough, and not necessarily 
look to the coach for the 
answer. ... We didn’t make any 
of those (big) plays, and that’s 
my job to make us get better in 
that.”

Against Gamecocks, Higdon gets 
crack at his former favorite team

The ‘Old Ball Coach’ has an 

admirer in Ann Arbor, whether 
he realizes it or not. 

Thursday afternoon, junior 

running back Karan Higdon 
admitted he “liked what Steve 
Spurrier was doing” at South 
Carolina before his retirement in 
2015.

Really, 
though, 
Higdon’s 

admiration for the Gamecocks 
goes beyond the program’s former 
patriarch. He rooted for South 
Carolina in high school, and it was 
a fandom born from familiarity.

He had a friend who went 

there, and kids in his local area 
took their talents to Columbia, 
too. He was close friends with 
the cousin of former Gamecock 
wide receiver Ace Sanders — 
who played at Manatee High 
School, just over 18 miles away 
from Higdon’s alma mater — so 
the duo frequently tuned into his 
games. And he said he loved the 
way Marcus Lattimore ran.

As it turns out, Higdon visited 

South Carolina a couple times.

It was an offer he coveted as a 

recruit. It was also one he never 
received.

If he did, this year’s installation 

of the Outback Bowl might look a 
little different. Asked what would 
have happened if the Gamecocks 
did offer him, Higdon didn’t 
hesitate.

“I would’ve went,” he said 

with a laugh.

Now, 
though, 
when 
the 

Wolverines face the Gamecocks 
on Jan. 1, Higdon’s story will 
have come full circle — thanks 
to an unconventional set of 
circumstances that got him to 
Ann Arbor in the first place.

Higdon met Lattimore on one 

of his visits to South Carolina. 
The former Gamecock running 
back was a fourth-round pick 
in 2013, drafted by the San 
Francisco 49ers. He never took 
an NFL snap, as he struggled to 
recover from an injury in 2012 

in which he tore every ligament 
in his right knee and dislocated 
his kneecap, before eventually 
retiring in 2014.

But Lattimore still met Jim 

Harbaugh while they were a 
brief player-coach pairing in San 
Francisco.

Higdon 
eventually 
did, 

too — part of 
a 
whirlwind 

recruiting 
process that saw 
him 
visit 
Ann 

Arbor 
in 
the 

week 
leading 

up to National 
Signing Day and 
eventually 
flip 

his commitment 
from 
Iowa 
to 

Michigan.

And Lattimore was a part of it.
“Actually, before I came here 

I stayed in touch with Marcus 
Lattimore, and he helped me 
make my decision to come here,” 
Higdon said. “He informed me a 

lot about the type of person Jim 
Harbaugh was, the type of coach. 
He led me. He was a big part of 
me coming here.”

The decision has paid off. 

Higdon leads the Wolverines’ 
backfield with 929 yards on 
147 
carries 
and 
11 
rushing 

touchdowns, and he’ll be the 

first 
Michigan 

running 
back 

to 
face 
South 

Carolina 
since 

the 
Outback 

Bowl in 2012.

That 
game, 

of course, didn’t 
end so well for 
one member of 
the Wolverines’ 
backfield — as 
Vincent 
Smith 

was the victim of a Jadeveon 
Clowney tackle that popped his 
helmet off and turned into an 
internet sensation.

It’s 
a 
hit 
that 
Higdon 

remembers well, and it’s one that 

he cheered for — even if he has 
never admitted such to Smith.

“Now me and Vincent are 

cool so I’m like, ‘Dang,’ ” Higdon 
said with a laugh. “But I was 
(cheering). And that was the year 
I had just visited there. … That 
happened and I was like, ‘Gollee.’ 
And I had saw Jadeveon at the 
game when I was visiting and 
I was like, ‘This is a huge dude.’ 
And then he does that.”

Of course, Higdon won’t be 

facing 
anyone 
of 
Clowney’s 

stature in Tampa, and the 
Gamecocks rank 12th in the SEC 
allowing 127.6 rushing yards per 
game.

Higdon 
could 
very 
well 

become Michigan’s first 1,000-
yard rusher since 2011 at the 
Outback Bowl. And if he does, it 
will come against the team that 
never offered him.

“I just loved them,” Higdon 

said. “… They didn’t offer me, and 
now I’m playing against them, so, 
I’m back.”

Wolverines earn 4-0 victory over State

In the last game of the 2017 

calendar year at Yost Ice Arena, 
the Michigan hockey team gave 
its fans two things they had been 
waiting all season to see.

Buoyed by a perfect, 21-for-21 

performance between the pipes 
by sophomore goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne, the Wolverines (3-4-2 
Big Ten, 7-6-2 overall) took down 
Michigan State, 4-0, on Thursday 
night, recording their first shutout 
of the year.

And 
with 
three 
minutes 

remaining, senior forward Tony 
Calderone scored his third goal of 
the game, capping off an emphatic 
victory over the Spartans (1-7-
1, 7-9-1) with his first career hat 
trick.

Each of Calderone’s goals came 

differently. The first took place 
with five minutes remaining in 
the second period. Senior forward 
Dexter Dancs’ pass hit Calderone 
on the edge of the crease, with 
just Spartan goaltender John 
Lethemon in the way. Calderone 
coolly took his time, dancing to 
the goalie’s left and firing the 
puck into the top of the net.

Calderone lit the lamp for a 

second time halfway through 
the third period. Junior forward 
Cooper Marody and Calderone 
worked 
a 
two-on-one 
to 

perfection, as Marody’s cross-ice 
pass hit Calderone’s stick and he 
finished with a one-timer.

The final tally, with 3:28 left 

in the game, materialized out of 
a scrum around the net, and the 
Wolverines’ captain knocked it 
home.

“I’ve had a couple two-goal 

games, it’s not something always 
on your mind too much but to get 
the third one really felt awesome,” 
Calderone said. “My linemates 
made it easy today. Dexter made a 
great play on two of them, Cooper 
made a great pass on the second 
so I think they made it really 
easy and they’re the reason it 
happened.”

Added Michigan coach Mel 

Pearson: “He scores in a bunch of 
different ways. The goal I really 
liked was the second goal of the 
game where he gets it all alone. 
It’s hard when you don’t have 
any speed and momentum, the 
goaltender’s just standing there 
with you. He made a bunch of 
moves, and he just made it look 
easy. I’m really happy for him, 
proud of him and the senior class 
the way they performed tonight.”

Despite statistics that might 

have 
predicted 
otherwise 
— 

Michigan State came into the 
contest ranking just 53rd in 
the nation in goals per game 
— the Spartans were the more 
threatening team in the game’s 
first 
five 
minutes. 
Quick, 

dangerous puck movement forced 
Lavigne to make several tough 
saves, and Michigan State held an 
early 5-0 advantage in shots on 
goal.

Surprisingly, though, Michigan 

might have come away from the 
first period with a stronger feeling 
of missed opportunity. After a 
Spartan penalty, the Wolverines 
began 
their 
first 
stretch 
of 

extended attack, and nearly came 
out of nowhere to shoot into the 
lead when the puck bounced to 
freshman forward Josh Norris 
in the crease with the goaltender 
way out of position. Norris’ shot, 
however, sailed over the pipe.

While 
Michigan 
couldn’t 

capitalize on its power play, the 
Wolverines did appear to be 
settled down from that point, as 
the rest of the first period was 
much more evenly matched.

The 
script 
of 
the 
initial 

stanza was flipped after the first 
intermission. This time, it was 
Michigan that had better chances 
— most notably, a flip shot by 
freshman forward Jack Becker 
that bounced over Lethemon and 
across the crease.

All that threatened to change, 

however, 
when 
Becker 
was 

penalized 
for 
cross-checking 

five minutes into the period. 
Sophomore defenseman Griffin 

Luce joined him in the box just 13 
seconds later, and the Wolverines 
found themselves staring down 
the barrel of a gun.

Michigan 
State, 
however, 

couldn’t pull the trigger. The 
Wolverines jammed together in 
front of the net, laying out to block 
shots while desperately trying to 
withstand the two-man deficit.

Upon 
returning 
to 
full 

strength, Michigan wasted no 
time breaking down the ice. 
Junior 
defenseman 
Joseph 

Cecconi launched a missile from 
the point, which Norris was there 
to tip home for a 1-0 lead. From 
there, the Wolverines didn’t look 
back.

While 
Calderone’s 

performance is the one that will 
undoubtedly 
be 
remembered 

from Thursday, Lavigne was 
superb in his own right. The 
sophomore 
commanded 
both 

sides of the net from the very 
beginning of the game, spreading 
out to deny the Spartans on 
numerous occasions.

Pearson was quick to give 

Lavigne the credit for Michigan’s 
first 
shutout, 
bemoaning 

the 
numerous 
“grade-A” 

opportunities that Michigan State 
had.

“We gave up too many grade-A 

opportunities,” Pearson said. “As 
you watch the game back, I’m 
not going to like it. Some of the 
opportunities we’re giving up, 
especially at key times in the game 
— I think Hayden bailed us out 
tonight. We’ve to be better, we’ve 
got to cut down on grade-As. You 
need goaltending, obviously, and 
he did a phenomenal job.”

Regardless, that criticism did 

little to erase the significance 
of the result, especially for the 
Wolverines’ senior class.

“I told the team after the 

game, the seniors, it’s your 
last game here in Yost against 
Michigan State — last regular 
season game at Yost,” Pearson 
said. “What a way to end your 
career against Michigan State at 
Yost Ice Arena.”

Deja Church, ‘M’ guard of future

In Deja Church, the Michigan 

women’s basketball team may 
have found its guard of the future. 

In the young season, the 

freshman standout has already 
made an impact as the first 
player off the bench. Her high 
level of play was on display in the 
24th-ranked Wolverines’ 82-76 
win over Marquette on Thursday 
night. Church went 5-for-8 from 
the floor to tie her career-high of 
12 points.

“Deja was incredible,” said 

Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico. “I think she’s getting better 
and better every time she steps out 
on the floor. She was outstanding 
on both ends of the floor, and she 
had a block that should make the 
SportsCenter highlight loop.”

Her most significant basket 

came with 3:54 left in the game 
when she hit a layup as the 
shot clock expired – giving the 
Wolverines a 71-67 lead.

In her 26 minutes on the floor, 

Church undertook much of the 

ball-handling responsibilities. For 
the most part, she seemed unfazed 
by the Golden Eagles’ full court 
press. She found success driving 
the lane and was able to knock 
down shots through contact.

But a lot of what Church brings 

to the court goes unnoticed in the 
box score. She is a high-energy 
player that aggressively attacks the 
basket. She plays stingy defense 
and always fights for loose balls.

With these intangibles and 

a high level of passion, Church 
takes after senior forward Jillian 
Dunston. Barnes Arico thinks 
Church’s fiery personality will 
be important in years to come. 
Dunston seems to agree.

“I love the comparison,” said 

Dunston. “And she has a lot of 
heart. I’m excited to see how she 
develops.”

Church, a Michigan native, 

prepped just down the road at 
Southfield A&T High School. 
As a senior, Church averaged 24 
points per game, 10 rebounds, 4.2 
assists and 3.1 steals while leading 
the Blue Jays to the semifinals of 
the state tournament. She earned 

a bevy of accolades, including 
a Class A Co-Player of the Year 
Award, OAA Player of the Year 
nod, a Michigan Miss Basketball 
finalist and a nomination for the 
McDonald’s All-American game.

Ranked as the 67th overall 

recruit 
by 
Prospects 
Nation, 

Church’s talents were sought 
after by many schools. Despite 
originally 
committing 
to 

Minnesota, 
Church 
ultimately 

decided to stay home.

“All my family is here,” said 

Church. “My family never missed 
a game in high school or AAU, and 
that really sunk in. So I changed 
my commitment to come here.”

It seems that Church made the 

right decision. Thus far, she has 
averaged 7.78 points per game 
while shooting an impressive 66 
percent from the field. Granted, 
at times, she has still looked like 
a freshman. Her four turnovers 
and pair of fouls in the fourth 
quarter undoubtedly contributed 
to Marquette’s near-comeback.

Even 
Church 
is 
certainly 

not a finished product. Barnes 
Arico feels she just needs more 
experience.

“I think the biggest thing for any 

freshman is to be consistent night in 
and night out and even throughout 
the course of the game,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I think mentally when 
we got up 16, Deja kind of relaxed 
for a second and then there were a 
couple of mistakes.”

For 
Church, 
the 
biggest 

adjustment has been the quick 
pace of play at the college level. 
She seems to be getting more 
comfortable, though, scoring 12 
points in each of her last three 
games. As the season progresses, 
she will likely be a bigger focal 
point of the offense. 

Coming 
into 
the 
season, 

questions remained over who 
would be the starting point guard 
after former guard Siera Thompson 
graduated. This year, Church isn’t 
the answer. Barnes Arico shifted 
senior guard Katelynn Flaherty to 
the point position.

But while Church has big 

shoes to fill by replacing the 
Wolverines all-time assists leader 
in Thompson and all-time scoring 
leader in Flaherty, her success 
seems imminent. 

Michigan pulls out 82-76 win 

With the outcome suddenly 

uncertain, 
the 
ball 
found 

Nicole Munger on the right 
wing. She took the shot and 
sunk the three, putting the 
Wolverines up by five with 
just under three minutes to go, 
the most important moment of 
Michigan’s season thus far.

The 24th-ranked Wolverines 

hung around in the first half, 
took a commanding lead in 
the third quarter, then nearly 
blew it in the fourth in a 
roller coaster 82-76 win over 
Marquette.

After Michigan (6-2) opened 

up a 16-point lead with just 
under eight minutes to go in the 
game, Marquette (4-4) started 
making shots. Suddenly, the 
Golden Eagles were on a 9-0 
run and the lead was cut to 
just seven. Minutes later, it 
was cut to two after an Erika 
Davenport layup and disaster 
was impending.

“Once we got the lead, we 

became very, very complacent,” 
said senior forward Jillian 
Dunston. “And we allowed 
them to get any shot off that 
they wanted.”

Michigan, however, managed 

to pull through thanks to 
Munger’s three, a timely charge 
by junior center Hallie Thome 
and an and-1 layup from senior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty. Those 
elements combined to get the 
lead to six. Crisis averted.

“(Coach Kim Barnes Arico) 

pretty much told us just to stay 
calm and the clock was our 
friend and the time was our 
friend,” said freshman guard 
Deja Church. “We were taking 
quick shots, she told us to pull 
the ball and let’s run the clock 
out a little bit and just stay 
calm, don’t let the defense 
rattle us.”

Marquette will lament this 

loss, and with good reason. 
It had a chance to put the 
Wolverines 
away 
early. 
It 

didn’t. It had the chance to pull 
off an impossible comeback in 
the fourth. It didn’t.

The Golden Eagles jumped 

out to a 10-4 lead in the game’s 
first 
five 
minutes 
as 
the 

Wolverines sleepwalked. From 
Munger missing two open shots 
to Dunston turning the ball 
over on an entry pass, Michigan 
didn’t look sharp. The chance 
was there for Marquette, but it 
couldn’t seize it.

By the time Church went 

coast to coast and laid the ball 
in to finish the game’s opening 
quarter, the Wolverines had cut 
the deficit to four.

From there, it was a tug-

of-war. With Flaherty held to 
seven points on 1-for-8 shooting 
from the field in the first half, 
Michigan had to batten down 
the hatches and play defense. 
That they did.

The 
Wolverines 
limited 

the Golden Eagles to just .868 
points per possession in the 
first half, an admirable mark 
against a team that ranked 16th 
in the country in points per 
game coming into the contest. 
That was enough to keep 
Michigan in the game going 
into the break, at which time it 
trailed 33-29.

The 
Wolverines’ 
two 

freshmen standouts — Church 
and forward Hailey Brown — 
ignited that effort. Church, 
who has lived up to her 
reputation as a strong one-on-
one defender, did so again on 
Thursday, forcing misses as 
easily as Flaherty hits shots. 
As for Brown, she provided 
vital rim protection, notching 
two blocks in the first half and 
three in the game.

As play opened in the second 

half, she forced a miss at the 
rim, then came down on the 
other end to for a layup, cutting 
Marquette’s lead down to two. 
One possession later, Munger 
hit a corner three to give 
Michigan its first lead of the 
night. The Wolverines never 
squandered that lead, despite 
their best efforts.

“I was nervous before the 

game that we couldn’t handle 
their pressure, but at halftime 
I was confident that we could 
handle 
their 
pressure 
and 

we could score against them 
from what I saw in the first 

half,” Barnes Arico said. “(At 
halftime), I said, ‘Try to go over 
the top, try to get rid of the ball 
when they’re double-teaming 
you 
and 
we’ll 
score 
easy 

baskets.’And I think we did.”

After 
Michigan 
took 
its 

initial lead, Flaherty put in 
a layup to extend the lead to 
three and it looked like the 
floodgates might open. No 
matter, the Golden Eagles’ 
Selena Lott nailed one from 
downtown to tie the game a few 
possessions later, stopping the 
impending cascade. However, 
she couldn’t stop the trickle.

The Wolverines spent the 

rest of the third methodically 
adding to their lead. A Flaherty 
layup 
here, 
two 
Thome 

free throws there and good 
defense throughout. After a 
few minutes, Michigan had 
pulled together an 8-0 run to 
go up 50-40. By the end of the 
quarter, the lead grew to 11. A 
few minutes into the fourth, it 
stood at 16.

That 
lead 
proved 

insurmountable.

FOOTBALL
Hurst undecided on 
playing in bowl game

Fifth-year senior defensive 

tackle Maurice Hurst Jr. has 
a long future of football ahead 
of him, but next on his plate is 
the Michigan football team’s 
bowl game.

Whether or not Hurst will 

play in that game, though, is 
still up in the air.

Hurst, who projects to be 

a high first-round NFL Draft 
pick, spoke to media Thursday 
afternoon and said that he has 
not yet decided whether he 
will play in the bowl game.

“I’m 
not 

really 
sure. 

Right now, it’s 
just 
business 

as 
usual,” 

Hurst said. “I 
haven’t made a 
decision.”

The risk of 

playing in the 
Outback Bowl 
on Jan. 1 relates 
to injuries.

Last year, Michigan’s senior 

tight end Jake Butt tore his 
ACL in the Orange Bowl. Butt 
was drafted by the Denver 
Broncos with the first pick 
of the fifth round, No. 145 
overall, but could have likely 
been picked much higher — 
and earned a significantly 
higher pay check — had he not 
been injured.

Butt 
spoke 
before 
the 

Orange Bowl and said that he 
fully understood and respected 
the 
decision 
of 
players 

like 
Stanford’s 
Christian 

McCaffrey, who chose not to 
play in a bowl game to avoid 
the risk of injury.

Nonetheless, Butt decided 

to 
play 
and 
unfortunately 

faced a devastating outcome.

“Being there,” Hurst said, 

“and seeing (Butt) go down, 
it was heart wrenching to see 
the emotion on his face.”

Hurst, now in the same 

position that Butt was in a year 
ago, contemplates the same 
decision.

He said that he’s going to 

be talking with his family, 
coach Jim Harbaugh, Butt and 
guys like former defensive 
end Chris Wormley — who 
now plays for the Baltimore 
Ravens.

Hurst 

hopes to have 
the 
decision 

finalized 
sometime in the 
next two weeks.

Pro Football 

Focus 
added 

Hurst 
to 
its 

All-American 
First Team for 
defense, 
and 

rated 
him 
as 

the top-graded player in the 
country for both sides of the 
ball.

His talent is obvious, and 

his stats back it all up. He 
has contributed 132 tackles, 
33 tackles for loss and 13 
sacks over the course of his 
Michigan career, and was 
a consensus first team All-
Big Ten honoree by both the 
coaches and media.

One of the only things not 

on Hurst’s resume is an NFL 
contract.

But that really will come, 

regardless 
of 
his 
decision 

about 
the 
upcoming 
bowl 

game.

The fifth-year senior defensive tackle 
said he is still weighing his options
