In a formal request to the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Board 
of 
Regents 
Monday 

morning, University President 
Mark Schlissel called for the 
renaming of the C.C. Little 
Science Building after months 
of protests against the former 
University president’s history 
of 
eugenics 
research 
and 

involvement in the tobacco 
industry. 
The 
regents 
are 

set to vote Thursday on the 
recommendation.

“The University community 

makes a significant commitment 
to an individual or family when 
it names a space after a person 
and those who wish to change it 
carry a heavy burden,” Schlissel 
wrote 
in 
a 
communication 

released on the agenda for the 
upcoming Thursday meeting. 
“In this case, I believe that 
heavy burden has been met 
for the reasons articulated in 
the 
(advisory 
committee’s) 

recommendation.”

Review of the building’s 

association 
with 
Little 
by 

the 
President’s 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

History began after an official 
request from University faculty 
and students to the committee 
to change the building’s name 

The Michigan Daily and 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel met Monday afternoon 
to discuss the University of 
Michigan’s role in responding 
to 
national 
movements 

concerning sexual misconduct 
and 
gun 
violence. 
Schlissel 

also commented on matters 
concerning the University and 
Ann Arbor specifically, including 
his 
recent 
recommendation 

for 
the 
renaming 
of 
C.C. 

Little Science Building and 
West Quad Residence Hall’s 
Winchell 
House, 
the 
racist 

blackface 
Snapchat 
incident, 

the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization 
bargaining 

efforts for higher wages and 
benefits and the Detroit Free 
Press’s 
investigation 
into 

the 
University’s 
reported 

investment of endowment funds 
into the companies of prominent 
University donors.

C.C. Little and Winchell 

House renaming

Monday 
morning, 
the 

University Board of Regents 
released 
their 
agenda 
for 

this 
Thursday’s 
meeting 
in 

the Michigan Union, which 
included two recommendations 
from Schlissel to remove the 
names from the C.C. Little 
Science 
Building 
and 
West 

Quad’s Winchell House. The 
announcement has come after 
months of student protests, 
dialogues with administrators 

and 
investigations 
into 
the 

University figures the buildings 
were 
named 
after 
by 
the 

President’s Advisory Committee 
on University History.

The 
administration 
came 

under fire for the names of 
the 
buildings 
after 
more 

research had been done and 
heavily publicized about Little 
and Winchell, and the social 
movements 
they 
supported 

through their work at the 

University. 
Little, 
a 
former 

president of the University, was 
a renowned eugenicist who 
supported 
the 
sterilization 

of people he deemed inferior 
such as minorities and people 
with disabilities and a very 
large supporter of the tobacco 
industry, despite his background 
in science.

Winchell, on the other hand, 

served as a professor and regent 
at the University in the late 1800s 

and published many academic 
pamphlets alleging white people 
were physically predetermined 
to be the dominant race due to 
brain size and other various 
metrics, a sentiment that is now 
called racist and has been proven 
to be incorrect by countless 
studies.

After 
the 
committee’s 

research 
and 
months 
of 

deliberation, 
the 
committee 

A self-driving car killed a 

pedestrian last week in Tempe, 
Ariz. when an Uber SUV struck 
Elaine Herzberg as she was 
crossing the street with her 
bike at night. Since the accident, 
students and faculty involved 
with 
autonomous 
transport 

research at the University of 
Michigan have grappled with 
the implications of the fatality 
and how the event might alter 
the trajectory or research of 
driverless cars in the future.

The University opened its 

own autonomous vehicle testing 
facility, Mcity, in 2015, a 32-acre 
urban environment on North 
Campus with freeways, roads, 
signs and artificial storefronts. 
Since then, the international 
research 
community 
has 

regarded Ann Arbor as a leading 
city for self-driving research and 
testing.

Already, Uber has temporarily 

grounded public autonomous 
testing in four cities across the 
U.S. since the fatality yet current 
state and federal legislation 
does little to discuss the ethics

Graduate Employees’ Organization to host call to action on Trans Day of Disposability

Due to inadequate transgender 

care 
services, 
the 
Graduate 

Employees’ Organization — a union 

representing 
graduate 
student 

instructors and graduate student 
staff assistants at the University 
of Michigan — is fighting for 
transgender health care coverage by 
raising awareness at their Trans Day 
of Disposability rally and putting 
pressure on the University Human 
Resources to take part in health 
care negotiations. Through these 

negotiations, GEO hopes to achieve 
more transparent information and 
health care coverage from at least 
two providers for the transgender 
community in Ann Arbor.

GEO’s Trans Health Caucus 

has been meeting with Human 
Resources in special conferences to 
address trans health care coverage 
under GradCare, a health care plan 

exclusively available for graduate 
students, 
including 
instructors, 

staff 
assistants 
and 
research 

assistants. Though GradCare covers 
transgender surgeries in general, 
it deems specific genital surgeries 
as cosmetic and refuses to cover 
those expenses. According to Jill 
Seale, a Transgender Resources and

of publicly testing autonomous 
vehicles. In December 2013, Gov. 
Rick Snyder signed a bill into 
law that advanced the public 
 

testing 
of 
self-driving 
cars 

on Michigan roads. At the 
time, 
Snyder 
was 
one 
of 

several governors nationwide 
who promoted the testing of 
driverless 
vehicles 
in 
their 

states.

Some feel as though the 

event could bring the testing 
efforts of Uber and other tech 
firms to a halt in Tempe and in 
other U.S. cities that support 
the technology. On campus, 
University 
students 
have 

expressed surprise in response 
to 
the 
fatality, 
but 
worry 

little will be done to prevent 
autonomous vehicle tragedies 
down the road.

Engineering senior Charu 

Dwivedi said he thinks the 
accident 
will 
be 
regarded 

as a critical moment in the 
development of the driverless 
cars.

“Especially with the speed 

and recklessness that Uber and 
other companies have been 
trying to push the technology, I 
wasn’t very surprised,” Dwivedi 
said. “I’d say it’s an important 
chapter that had to happen in 
the progression of autonomous 
vehicle technology.”

Information 
senior 
Ethan 

Jannott, 
who 
has 
focused 

much of his undergraduate 
career 
investigating 
and 

designing autonomous vehicle 
interfaces, said he thinks the 
crash in Arizona was largely 
unpreventable. Though he was 
surprised the driverless Uber 
failed to detect the pedestrian 
crossing the street, he said it 
would have been difficult for a 
human driver to respond in time 
as well.

“If it was a human in the 

car, it would have struck her 
in the same way,” Jannott said. 
“Because it was really dark, a 

person wouldn’t have picked 
up on the pedestrian either. 
That is only the first time an 
autonomous car has killed a 
pedestrian, so it was bound to 
happen at some point ... I think 
people may be slightly wearier 
to accept the technology in the 
near future, but it’s not going to 
affect the industry.”

Tech 
companies 
and 

automakers like Uber, Lyft, 
Google, Waymo, General Motors 
Corp. and Toyota have invested 
billions into autonomous vehicle 
research acting on a hunch that 
soon driverless car will be the 
norm and humans behind the 
wheel will be a thing of the past. 
Politicians, like Arizona Gov. 
Doug Ducey, have welcomed 
public 
autonomous 
vehicle 

testing with “open arms and 
wide open roads” even as much 
remains unknown about the 
technology.

Jannott commented while 

it may seem dangerous to have 
legislation 
that 
encourages 

public testing of autonomous 

cars, it’s too important to 
reject.

“I think public testing has 

to be done at some point,” 
Jannott said. “I think we’re 
right on the cusp of where it’s 
totally accepted technology. 
At the same time, the level 
of autonomy that they’re at 
is at a point where we can 
trust it. I think there should 
definitely be more adoption 
of the technology around 
the 
country 
for 
safety 

reasons.”

Many members of the 

University’s 
research 

community 
have 
been 

anticipating a tragedy like 
the one in Tempe for quite 
some time. Lionel Robert, 
associate professor in the 
School of Information, who 
presides over a University 
study 
investigating 

interactions 
between 

autonomous 
vehicles 

and pedestrians, said the 
accident 
was 
something 

which he and his colleagues 
have been preparing for.

“The industry has been 

holding its breath for a while 

hoping this kind of thing doesn’t 
occur,” Robert said. “I would 
say, they’ve in some ways been 
getting ready for when this does 
occur. When someone is killed 
at the hands of an autonomous 
vehicle the real question is, 
what’s next?”

According to Robert, the 

University 
holds 
a 
unique 

position in the discussion of 
self-driving technology because 
of the resources from different 
schools that are connected with 
Mcity.

“From 
the 
technical 

standpoint, we can test the 
technology in a lot of different 
areas,” Robert said. “The larger 
picture is that we occupy a 
unique position in our ability 
to engage the public in this 
conversation. I think Michigan 
across the board, we have a lot 
of the ability to lead proactive 
change in this field because of 
the strength and diversity of 
our approach to autonomous 
driving. 
The 
School 
of 

Engineering, 
the 
School 
of 

Information, 
the 
School 
of 

Public Policy are all getting 
involved and chiming in on this 
debate.”

Anuj 
Pradhan, 
assistant 

research 
scientist 
at 
the 

University’s 
Transportation 

Research Institute, is involved 
in 
investigating 
pedestrian 

trust in autonomous vehicles. 
He said while the fatality 
was tragic, it will motivate 
researchers to perfect future 
iterations of the technology. 
He noted that without failure 
and accidents, those developing 
the autonomous cars would 
struggle to polish their product 
for consumers.

“When there’s a fatality, it 

means that we are even more 
motivated to do our research 
well so that fatalities don’t occur 
in the future,” Pradhan said. 
“Our research explicitly focuses 
on preventing these things from 
happening so when a tragedy 
like this occurs, obviously we 
are very distressed, but overall 
for safety researchers, we just 
get all the more motivated to 
make sure that something like 
this will never happen again.”

Retention Coordinator at Portland 
State 
University, 
obtaining 

proper treatments is imperative 
for a transgender individual’s 
wellbeing.

“Let 
me 
be 
clear, 
these 

procedures are not cosmetic; 
they’re 
medically 
necessary,” 

Seale 
said. 
“The 
American 

Medical Association has agreed on 
this for a decade. Living in a body 
that fits with what you feel is right 
for you can save your life.”

According to the 2015 U.S. 

Transgender Survey Report of 
nearly 28,000 trans individuals 
across the nation, 55 percent of 
trans people requesting insurance 
coverage for help with gender 
affirming surgery were denied, 
23 percent of the respondents 
avoided their physician out of 
fear of mistreatment, 40 percent 
of 
transgender 
individuals 

have attempted suicide in their 
lifetimes and 7 percent of trans 
people attempted suicide in the 
past year.

According to Rackham student 

Vidhya Aravind, GEO Solidarity 
and Political Action Committee 

co-chair, 
GEO 
attempted 
to 

contact 
University 
Human 

Resources six times over the 
course of several months before 
the office agreed to conduct 
negotiation 
sessions. 
Despite 

extensive bargaining discussions, 
Human Resources only agreed 
to speak about trans health care 
coverage five times over a span of 
three years.

“In 
that 
first 
conference, 

we asked for a list of all the 
trans health care providers at 
University of Michigan Health 
System organized by procedure, 
so we could plan for our future 
negotiations,” Aravind said. “After 
delaying for three months, HR 
finally sent us a copy of our own 
benefits document, a link to the 
public facing and information 
devoid UMHS trans health care 
site, and a copy of a document we 
brought on our own to the first 
meeting. Worse than a failure 
to meet our request, this was 
insulting.”

The Comprehensive Gender 

Services 
Program 
is 
the 

University’s center for transgender 
medical care, providing services 
ranging from family care to plastic 
surgery. However, members of the 
transgender community in Ann 

Arbor are reportedly unsatisfied 
with CGSP’s level of care.

According to Carta Monir, 

a 
local 
transgender 
woman 

currently seeking care through 
CGSP, the University advertises 
the center as a one-stop shop but 
does not deliver quality care.

“I’m hopeful that HR will 

begin to understand how poorly 
the CGSP is regarded by the Ann 
Arbor trans community, and 
how low their standard of care is 
compared to other universities, 
even,” Monir said. “This is not a 
world-class transgender health 
system, and it’s my hope that HR 
would like it to be one, instead of 
the poorly-functioning hindrance 
it is right now.”

When 
obtaining 
hormones 

and seeking genital surgeries, the 
process can allegedly take months 
despite the time-sensitive nature 
of the treatments.

“The CGSP required a letter 

from my therapist and then 
went silent for weeks,” Monir 
said. “In the end, I waited 
months for something that could 
have been done in one or two 
days … Getting hormones isn’t 
anything compared to any of 
the more specific trans medical 
necessities.”

However, according to CGSP 

Director Sarah Wiener, the time 
frame completely depends on 
each case and how quickly they 
receive the therapists’ letters.

“The time frame is really 

dependent on how quickly those 
letters come in,” Wiener said. “If 
they come in right away we can 
look at them and help the person 
get connected to a provider. It 
just really depends on the letters. 
We take up to 10 business days 
to review letters … So that people 
aren’t waiting too long for us to 
review a letter.”

Wiener emphasized all 20 

of 
CGSP 
providers 
function 

under the World Professional 
Association 
for 
Transgender 

Health 
Standards 
of 
Care, 

requiring either one or two letters 
from mental health professionals 
depending on the level of care. 
This model is more extensive 
than informed consent, entailing 
the individual seeking treatment 
to simply agree to the care and 
procedures. In addition to these 
standards, the CGSP’s lack of 
multiple providers for various 
surgeries limits patients’ options.

teaching one another in person.

“I teach one course which is 

a lecture course, every other 
course I teach, I come to teach 
it by discussion, I don’t do much 
lecturing, and students tend 
to love that kind of course,” 
Marwil said. “I want discussion 
to happen within the four walls 
of the classroom rather than 
the walls of the web; (students) 
teach each other in class. 
History is a subject in which 
there aren’t any answers, just 
questions.”

For 
students 
at 
many 

universities, 
logging 
onto 

Canvas is an essential part of 
their day. The Canvas tool, for 
most courses, has all of the 
information 
students 
need, 

including syllabi, assignments, 
and grades, bridging ridges the 
relationship between students 
and teachers by creating a 
resource in which students can 
submit and receive feedback 
and 
collaborate 
with 
one 

another 
through 
discussion 

posts. For most students, this 
tool is invaluable. However, 
some University of Michigan 
professors feel their course and 
their students benefit from not 
using Canvas.

English 
professor 
John 

Whittier-Ferguson 
chooses 

to 
use 
Google 
Drive 
over 

Canvas because Google Drive 
allows students to access their 
classwork beyond their time 
at the University. In an email 
interview, 
Whittier-Ferguson 

said using Google Drive allows 
him to easily change things 
throughout the term and leave 
comments for students on work 
that remains owned by the 
student.

“The 
overhead 
of 
every 

(educational) 
platform 
I’ve 

checked out (CTools, Canvas, 
Blackboard) gets in the way 
of my working with students 
on 
their 
writing 
and 
also 

gets in the way of my sharing 
materials with them through 
my syllabi,” Whittier-Ferguson 
wrote. “For the work I do with 
 

students, I see nothing at 
all 
that 
would 
recommend 

any 
proprietary 
education 
 

company 
platform 
over 

my minimalist, free, easily 
accessed approach.”

Whittier-Ferguson 
feels 

not 
using 
Canvas 
makes 

things easier for students, as 
it allows them to gain access 
to course materials without 

logging in and makes it easier 
for him to communicate with 
his students. He also finds the 
other 
educational 
platforms 

slower, more cumbersome and 
more complex.

“I 
don’t 
need 
postings,” 

Marwil said. “I can contact 
students 
through 
Wolverine 

Access and they can contact 
me. I live in a simpler world, 
that’s why I don’t use Canvas, 
and 
when 
the 
world 
gets 

complicated, I will adjust to it.”

Marwil has seen success 

with his style of teaching. He 
said he rarely has a student 
ask why he doesn’t use Canvas. 
Both Marwil and his students 
consider him a harsh grader 
but despite his grading, he said 
his students give him positive 
teaching evaluations and he 
considers that a testament to 
his teaching style.

“It’s not that my classes are 

simple — they are not — but I 
have a certain simplicity and 
understanding 
about 
what 

teaching is about,” Marwil 
said. “It’s not rocket science 
and I think people who make it 
rocket science don’t know what 
they are doing. You should be 
able to walk into a classroom 
with a book and teach.”

LSA 
freshman 
Andrew 

Armstrong, one of Marwil’s 
students, said he enjoys the 
course and feels the course is 
enriched without the use of 
Canvas as it keeps students on 
their toes.

“I sometimes will look at 

Canvas and feel like I can slack 
a little,” Marwil said. “When 
you are not using Canvas, you 
can’t 
slack 
on 
assignments 

and you have to give it your all 
because you don’t know your 
grade.”

Like 
Armstrong, 
LSA 

sophomore 
Lillie 
Heyman 
 

likes 
the 
alternative 

communication 
systems 
in 

her Gender and the Law class, 
taught by Asian Languages 
and Cultures professor Allison 
Alexy. The class uses Canvas, 
but most course information is 
located on a separate website. 

“I really like the website, 

I think it is much easier to 
navigate,” 
Heyman 
said. 
 

“I think that her website is 
much 
more 
organized 
and 

information 
is 
much 
more 

accessible, 
however, 
since 

every other class is on Canvas, 
my whole course load is not 
in 
one 
central 
location... 

(Also) the website is way more 
aesthetically pleasing, which is 
important to me.”

was submitted to Schlissel last 
September. 

According to the request, 

the committee found Little’s 
research 
and 
advocacy 
on 

eugenics, coupled with his 
support 
for 
the 
tobacco 

industry, was not a history the 
University could support and 
memorialize, especially given 
the building’s connection to the 
field of science. The building 
currently houses the College 
of 
Pharmacy, 
among 
other 

departments. 

Associate history professor 

John 
Carson, 
who 
was 
a 

member of the group that 
originally requested the C.C. 
Little 
building’s 
name 
be 

removed, said he was enthused 
to hear of President Schlissel’s 
recommendation on Monday.

“I think it’s exciting. I was 

very excited to receive a letter 
today from the president’s office 
saying that he had come to a 
decision and was recommending 
to the regents that the name be 
changed,” Carson said. “There’s 
a long way to go, but all steps 
matter, and this seems to be an 
important step in reminding us 
that history is an ongoing thing, 
and that making the University 
welcoming and open to the 
community is going to be a 
constant struggle.”

Protests 
erupted 
around 

the C.C. Little building last 
semester in conjunction with 
a 
series 
of 
bias 
incidents 

attacking Black students on 
campus, as students, faculty 
and staff picketed multiple 
times to remove the name. 
LSA senior Anushka Sarkar, 
 

Central Student Government 
president, first officially brought 
the matter to the regents’ 
attention at their meeting last 
October. Ultimately, Schlissel 
agreed the name should be 
changed. 

“The committee emphasized 

that 
Little’s 
support 
and 

participation 
in 
these 

campaigns had serious negative 
consequences noting that ‘his 
1920s campaign for eugenic 
measures 
while 
University 

President 
— 
immigration 

restriction, 
sterilization 
of 

the ‘unfit,’ anti-miscegenation 
laws — and the 1950s campaign 
sowing doubt about the links 
between smoking and cancer 
negatively affected the lives of 
millions,’” Schlissel’s statement 
read. 

LSA Associate Dean Angela 

Dillard, who was also involved 
in the initial effort to change 
the name of the building, said 
she felt this decision showed the 
positive change that can come 
from conversation and protest 
on campus.

“I thought it was a really 

important moment not only 
for the University itself, but 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
power 

of public history, the power 
of the humanities, to be able 
to help to shape debates and 
controversy, and then to help 
the University figure out how 
to do the right thing,” Dillard 
said. “It shows that it’s worth 
having conversation, debate, 
even protest, to get people to 
think carefully and critically 
about our history — what are 
we celebrating, what are we not 
celebrating, whose name is on a 
building, whose name isn’t on a 
building.”

Back in October, students 

shut down the transit center 
named 
after 
Little. 
LSA 

sophomore Nando Felten told 
The Daily the name was a point 
of contention for him and many 
other Black students. 

“How would it be if you were 

going to say, if you were Jewish, 
and you say, ‘I’m going to Adolf 
Hitler bus stop?’ That’s not 
cool,” Felten said. “For Black 
people, this is not cool because 
if our great grandparents had to 
deal with him, we wouldn’t be 

here right now.”

University 
student 

governments including CSG, 
LSA student government and 
Rackahm student government 
also vocalizedtheir support for 
the remaining of the C.C. Little 
building, 
passing 
initiatives 

to show the student body’s 
support.

Until a new name can be 

established, 
the 
University 

Policy for Naming of Facilities, 
Spaces and Streets mandates 
“the building will be referred to 
by its street address, 1100 North 
University Avenue, or by a 
functional designation that will 
be determined by the Associate 
Vice President for Facilities and 
Operations.”

Schlissel also requested the 

West Quad Residence Hall’s 
Winchell House be renamed 
due to Alexander Winchell’s, a 
professor at the University in 
the late 1800s, racist academic 
studies at the University.

Winchell was a professor 

of 
engineering, 
physics 

and geology as well as a 
regent during his time at 
the University. While at the 
University, he published many 
academic pamphlets and papers 
that connected brain power 
to race and claimed white 
individuals were positioned to 
be the superior race.

Public Policy junior Kevin 

Sweitzer 
submitted 
the 

request 
in 
February 
2017 

and the committee approved 
 

the 
renaming 
unanimously 

last September. The committee 
primarily 
focused 
on 

Winchell’s novel “Preadamites; 
Or a Demonstration of the 
 

Existence 
of 
Men 
Before 

Adam,” which they found to be 
dangerous racist rhetoric and 
supportive of current white 
supremacist movements.

RENAMING
From Page 1

recommended last September 
that Winchell be renamed, and 
last January the investigation on 
Little followed suit.

In response to inquiries about 

why these announcements came 
so late after the committee 
had already submitted their 
recommendations, Schlissel said 
he spent those months gathering 
advice and seeking opinions from 
University figures and consulting 
previous examples of changing 
building 
names 
from 
other 

universities in order to make his 
decision.

“When I get things, I discuss 

them with my executive team 
and others whose advice I 
rely on,” Schlissel said. “I’ve 
discussed this with students that 
I’ve met on various occasions, 
alumni, just wanting to educate 
myself. It’s not something the 
University’s done before but 
other universities have done this, 
so I wanted to read up and look 
at and talk to people who have 
gone through similar thought 
processes at other universities 

before becoming comfortable 
recommending 
that 
we 
do 

something that we hadn’t done 
before.”

While many students see 

Schlissel’s recommendation as 
a gateway to dialogues about 
other buildings and honorary 
names on campus for people 
with problematic pasts, Schlissel 
made it clear he did not want this 
action to become the norm. He 
said these two cases provided 
a unique case for renaming 
University buildings.

“This sort of thing will be 

exceptionally 
rare,” 
Schlissel 

said. “These might be the only 
two cases where we ever do 
this. It’s not clear. It depends 
what comes forward and the bar 
should be set very high. We don’t 
want the names of things to be 
changing as fashions change.”

Sexual 
Assault 
and 

Misconduct

Moving on to the issues of 

sexual assault and misconduct, 
such as those that have come 
to the forefront of national 
conversations with movements 
such as #MeToo, #TimesUp 
and the recent Larry Nassar 
trials, Schlissel addressed the 

recent 
legislation 
passed 
by 

the Michigan Senate to extend 
the statute of limitations on 
cases in which sexual assault 
survivors are under the age of 
16, increase Title IX resources 
to survivors and expand sexual 
assault prevention and education 
programs.

Many raised concerned about 

a request from the Michigan 
Association of State Universities, 
of which the University is a 
member, that came days before 
voting to delay the legislation. 
While the bill received support 
on both sides of the aisle, 
MASU argued it would have 
“profound impact.” Legislators 
like 
state 
Sen. 
Margaret 

O’Brien, R-Portage, claimed the 
prolonging would “delay justice, 
or maybe the hope is to stop it 
entirely.”

Schlissel stated this request 

did not signal any opposition 
to the legislation, but was put 
forward in order to ensure all 
aspects of the legislation were 
considered before quick passage.

“The 
University 
doesn’t 

necessarily oppose any of that 
legislation, nor does the MASU,” 
Schlissel said. “There just wasn’t 

a thoughtful analysis done of that 
full package of legislation.”

When looking at the part of 

legislation that would increase 
the statute of limitations for 
reporting 
sexual 
assault 
or 

harassment, Schlissel argued this 
sort of proposal should be studied 
before coming to conclusions 
on possible benefits, due to its 
impact on trial proceedings.

“Amongst the things they 

included 
was 
an 
extreme 

lengthening of the statute of 
limitations which in effect would 
say that if you had an event that 
happened 25 years ago you could 
bring forward a claim tomorrow,” 
Schlissel said. “Before suggesting 
that such a law would help us, it 
should be analyzed and there just 
was almost no time. There was 
a day, a half a day of hearings, 
and then it was brought forward, 
voted on and approved.”

Schlissel went on to reference 

the trials of Larry Nassar, a 
former MSU and USA gymnastics 
doctor, and around 250 survivors 
who came forward with proof of 
endemic sexual abuse.

56TH
ANNUAL
FILM
FESTIVAL

On Wednesday, Mar. 25, Academy 

Award-winning 
Visual 
Effects 

Supervisor 
John 
Nelson 
(“Blade 

Runner: 2049”) gave an illustrated 

lecture on how he and his team created 

some of the 1,200 visual effects shots 

in his most recent Oscar triumph, 

“Blade Runner: 2049.” The festival 

is something of a homecoming for 

Nelson, a Detroit native who attended 

the University. In anticipation of the 

56th installment of the Ann Arbor Film 

Festival, Nelson spoke with The Daily 

over the phone to discuss the festival, 

his films and his career. 

The Michigan Daily: So first 

things first, I think some congrats are 

in order, as you’re a recent Academy 

Award winner. Congratulations, that’s 

incredible.

John Nelson: Thank you, thank 

you! It has been a week, but I think our 

feet are finally sort of coming down 

to Earth now, you know? It has been 

a special week. You know, I won 17 

years ago and I was up twice — I didn’t 

win — and being nominated is a true 

honor, it really is, but winning is really 

something, you know?

TMD: Yeah, absolutely, and I 

imagine that winning an Oscar can’t be 

a feeling you ever really get used to.

JN: Yeah, it’s like, the closest thing 

I can describe it as, is it’s like someone 

has come up behind you with a cattle 

prod and shocked you in the butt with 

10,000 volts. You’re pretty electrified 

from the moment you hear the outcome 

because the whole night everyone is 

nervous until your award — anyone 

that’s up is nervous until the moment 

your award is decided — and you’re 

either gonna be really happy or you’re 

gonna be congratulating the winner 

and then going to the bar.

TMD: So just to clear the air and get 

my fanboy-ish doting over with, I have 

to say: “Blade Runner: 2049” was one 

of my favorite films of the year. I mean, 

growing up watching the original 

film, it was incredible to see what you 

accomplished with this sequel.

JN: Well thank you, thank you, it 

was a true labor of love for everyone 

because everyone had a great deal of 

respect for the original movie and for 

Ridley (Scott, director of the original 

“Blade Runner”). We’re doubly blessed 

because, you know, taking on a movie 

like this is a daunting task because 

you’re trying to do a sequel to a movie 

that is everyone’s favorite movie and 

it’s pretty difficult to do and do well, 

but fortunately for us we had — our 

new director Denis Villeneuve is pretty 

brilliant. So you have a master painter 

with the original, sort of, with Ridley, 

and then you have a new master painter 

with Denis. The reason the movie is 

so deeply felt and so intense is really 

because we have a great team — the 

producers put together a great team, 

and being led by Denis is really special.

TMD: Right, I can imagine. So on 

the topic of the team behind the film, 

if you don’t mind explaining what your 

role is on a project as the Visual Effects 

Supervisor, would you say that’s more 

creatively focused or more technically 

focused?

JN: Overwhelmingly, I think my job 

is to creatively keep the movie on track, 

visual-effects-wise, but half of my job is 

to technically figure out things that are 

either too expensive, too dangerous or 

impossible to do by any other means. 

I’m involved from the beginning of 

pre-production and designing the shots 

through principle photography and 

shooting the shots for what we call our 

plates. A plate is an element that you 

shoot on set and then you combine it 

with a bunch of other elements into 

a finished shot. I’m involved in pre-

production in the design, in working 

out technically how we’re going to be 

fast on set because some of our (shots) 

are incredibly technically challenging. 

The whole point of filmmaking is that 

the technique never overshadows 

the creativity, right, and you try to 

be creatively on-point with the story, 

so whatever you do echoes the story 

and drives it forward, it doesn’t call 

attention to itself as a technique. So I 

would say my job is probably 60 percent 

creative, 40 percent technique, but the 

technical aspect of my job is incredibly 

challenging, and so you find a lot of 

people who are half-engineer, half-

artist doing my work. I come out of the 

camera department so I like to shoot a 

lot of stuff, as many elements as I can 

get, and you try to shoot as much as 

you can during principle photography 

and then in post-production you do 

all the stuff that is necessary, all the 

other elements that are combined 

with the photographic plate you have 

to generate, and in this day and age 

sometimes it’s faster not to have a 

photographic plate at all. I tend to, again 

because I come out of camera, I tend to 

like to have photographic elements — as 

many as I can get — before I go the full 

CG route. 

TMD: One thing that really stood 

out to me about the film is just how 

well the environment tells the story of 

what events transpired in between the 

original film and “2049.” How much of 

a role would you say storytelling plays 

in what you do with VFX?

JN: I think it’s a tremendous thing. I 

mean, everyone who works in the movie 

business is good at craft and technique, 

and they kind of channel all of that 

craft and technique and everything 

they’ve learned and everything they’re 

good at into the service of storytelling. 

If you’re stepping over the line and 

drawing attention to yourself, it’s 

probably the wrong choice, and so 

I think storytelling is always on my 

mind. I will never review a shot outside 

of the cut of the movie, so when I get 

shots back from the effects vendors 

that I work with — and there are eight 

VFX vendors on this shoot — in three 

or four different countries, right, and 

I will always look at it in the cut. The 

cut is how you’re telling the story, how 

you want (the film) to be perceived. 

Storytelling 

is 
immensely 

important, I mean 

you look at the 

cities (in the film), 

but also at Joi or 

Rachael, and it’s 

even more important. 

TMD: So speaking of Joi, her 

character is involved in some of the 

film’s most visually unique moments, 

such as the merging scene with Joi and 

Mariette, where you have them sort of 

superimposed atop one another. Care 

to walk us through how that scene was 

put together?

JN: The merge is my favorite scene 

in the movie, and that was incredibly 

hard to do. It was one of those things 

where, like in many creative endeavors, 

you design it and then you say, “This is 

gonna be good, but we have to do it.” and 

then in the process of doing it you find 

new things that you drill into. For us, 

we shot both women separately, then 

we mapped them out to CG surrogates 

of themselves. Then we blended 

them together and we didn’t want the 

moment, the sequence to climax too 

early — no pun intended — we didn’t 

want the women all of a sudden to just 

go like this and be locked in and be 

perfect. So we had these moments, like 

shots, where it would start out of sync 

and at the end of the shot it would be in 

sync and at the start of the next shot it 

would be out of sync until this moment 

where he grabs her from behind and 

brings her to him and you get like three 

or four shots in a row where you see one 

woman’s performance, then another 

woman’s performance, then their eyes 

line up and they become a third woman 

that also is performing. Because we 

were using only computer graphics 

to supplement the photography we 

were filming, and we only used the 

CG to create a backdrop, like when 

you look through a glass of water you 

see the other side of the glass, that was 

the CG part. The art was in shooting 

and mapping and putting those 

performances together, and when the 

eyes of those women line up it is truly a 

magical moment. I mean, when I saw it, 

I jumped out of my seat and I said, “Yes! 

That is it,” and we have like three shots 

in a row where that happens and it’s 

really my favorite scene in the picture, 

so I always have to talk about it. 

TMD: Speaking as an artist, are 

there any films you can think of that 

have inspired you throughout your 

career or influenced your work?

JN: Oh yeah, big time. You know, 

I grew up in Grosse Pointe Woods, 

and I was the head usher at the Vogue 

Theater on Harper and Cadieux in the 

East Side of Detroit. I watched “2001” 

probably a hundred times, “Fantasia” 

a hundred times, I think both of those 

films have influenced me greatly. As 

I grew up and decided to go to film 

school I watched a lot of David Lean 

movies, which still impress me — 

Denis and I both love David Lean’s 

shots which are big shots with small 

people for grand scale and to show the 

place of the human within this vast 

landscape, right? Plus, those shots are 

tremendously cinematic. John Box, the 

production designer, and David Lean 

they’re just — I mean, if you look at the 

films he made: “Bridge Over the River 

Kwai,” “Lawrence of Arabia,” all of the 

others, he’s just pretty fantastic. Let’s 

see, I’m a big Billy Wilder fan, I’m a big 

Preston Sturges fan, I like the movies 

of the ’30s, a lot of pre-code movies I 

think are really interesting. I like the 

Coen Brothers’ movies, I think they’re 

quite good. I like Chris Nolan’s movies, 

John Nelson on tech, effects 
behind ‘Blade Runner 2049’

MAX MICHALSKY

Daily Arts Writer

I think they’re quite good. But you know, 

Stanley Kubrick had a huge influence on me, 

and I graduated from college in 1976 so I grew 

up watching them. I mean, I think maybe 

the first good movie I saw and realized the 

potential of cinema was “On the Waterfront,” 

I saw it with my family on a black and white 

TV in our living room and it just blew me 

away. “On the Waterfront” is really the power 

of visuals, acting, directing and music all 

together. It just makes this incredibly strong, 

emotional, cerebral statement. 

TMD: You mentioned growing up in the 

Detroit area, and I know you’re a University 

of Michigan alum, so why don’t we take a 

moment to talk about the upcoming Ann 

Arbor Film Festival? 

JN: Sure, you know when I started making 

movies (as a young filmmaker in Ann Arbor) 

I submitted them and they were accepted 

into the Film Festival. As both a screener 

and a filmmaker, I was involved and I think 

the AAFF is a tremendously creatively fertile 

place because there are no rules. The films 

that come in there are sort of oddball films 

that come in at tangential angles and it’s not 

like stuff you’ll see anyplace else. It’s always 

different, and I think it’s incredibly visually 

stimulating, I think that if you take a lot of that 

experimental film — a lot of the viewpoints of 

experimental film have sort of leached into 

society. You get something that could be, you 

know, non-narrative storytelling that could be 

almost kinetic storytelling. It’s really pretty 

interesting. Every year I go to the festival, I 

always walk away going, “Wow, that movie 

really was great,” you know what I mean? 

There’s some movies I don’t like, but there’s 

usually many films that I think are really, 

really, really great, and that’s the great prize of 

Ann Arbor: You have these things that are so 

unique and unusual. 

TMD: Would you say that these sort 

of avant-garde, experimental films may 

forecast what’s to come in the near future of 

filmmaking? 

JN: I think it depends. It depends on 

how on the narrative cycle — like on the 

classic narrative cycle — how mainstream 

entertainment will buy into it. There certainly 

is, with Netflix and Hulu and whatnot, there’s 

more demand in other places. On HBO last 

night I saw one of the shorts that I voted on 

for the short films (at the Academy Awards). 

It was a 20 minute or half-hour film, and in 

the past those films would just get shown 

for Oscar things and then never shown 

again, but now it’s on HBO. Or you look at 

documentaries, like all of the documentaries 

were really good this year. They’re always 

really good, and documentary filmmaking 

used to be kind of a niche. When I was in film 

school people would know about Frederick 

Wiseman and other people like that, the 

Maysles brothers. Now there’s a lot of really 

good documentaries being done all the time, 

and they’re documentaries but they also 

have a real point of view. There are non-

narrative, experimental films leaching into 

society — you want to know where you see it 

a lot? To be honest, you see it a lot in television 

commercials, in stuff like rock videos, stuff 

that is just off-the-wall different. Where 

being more visceral and kinetic is okay, you 

see it a lot there, and that’s really sort of cool. 

I remember reading this one thing on Stanley 

Kubrick that he used to watch commercials 

and some of them he liked quite a bit, and I 

understand that. I mean, most of them are not 

good, of course, but some are really interesting 

in the way that they approach what they’re 

doing and that’s where you see it too. It’s a 

whole new world for creative entertainment 

and there’s a million different places to get 

it. Who knows, in the future, just like there’s 

an old movie channel, Turner, maybe there’ll 

be an experimental film channel and people 

can go there when they want. It has an effect 

when something is striking and tells a story in 

a new and different way, there’s probably an 

audience for it. If you can get enough people to 

see it there probably will be an audience for it.

‘The Big House’

The crowd roars. That familiar voice 

blares across the stadium, “Ladies and 

gentlemen, 
presenting 
the 
Michigan 

marching band ... Band, take the field!” It’s 

a ritual, a Saturday morning tradition, and 

has been the central hub of activity in Ann 

Arbor on weekends for almost a hundred 

years. It’s a University football game at “The 

Big House,” the largest football stadium in 

North America, and now the one with an 

equally large and ambitious documentary 

to boot.

Filmed 
in 
collaboration 
between 

University students, Screen Arts and 

Cultures professors Terri Sarris and Abé 

Markus Nornes and visiting professor 

Kuzahiro Soda, “The Big House” is a 

complete and thorough examination of 

everything that happens on any given 

football Saturday, both on and off the field. 

The film features a number of segments, 

all of which are done in a style that places 

the viewing audience within the action to a 

startling degree. We follow, at various times, 

the band preparing to make its journey 

before the game, the preparations made 

by stadium staff for the visiting opponent, 

the parties and antics of students in the 

hours preceding the event and the trials 

and tribulations of the viewers watching 

the game from the stands as it unfolds. All 

this, and much more. “The Big House” is 

about as complete a depiction of a football 

Saturday in Ann Arbor as one could possibly 

hope for. The only facet of the day that 

appears to be missing is the experience of 

the players themselves, which doubtlessly 

seems like one of the few places in which 

the filmmakers might have had an access 

problem.

Although the various scenes of life in the 

stadium are interesting, strangely enough, it 

is when “The Big House” leaves home that 

the film truly soars. The most engaging and 

interesting segments of the film are the 

one’s that follow the variety of characters 

that populate the streets of Ann Arbor both 

before and after the game. From dancers, 

to people shouting about the town’s sins, 

to a particularly talented and funny street 

side drummer, these people bring a human 

element to the film and add some variety 

and humor to the film’s most entertaining 

segment. 

In other spots, it sometimes feels like the 

movie is repeating familiar beats. There are 

only so many shots of the crowd you can 

show before they all begin to seem the same. 

Some sequences feel like they outlive their 

running time but the film refuses to move 

on from them. Other times individual shots, 

such as one of a kid trying to sell M&Ms 

outside the arena, feel like they could be half 

as long as they are. Such is the nature of this 

style of filmmaking: To give the viewer a 

sense of totality to what they are witnessing. 

It will work for many, but there are some 

who will wish the movie moved a little bit 

faster.

More 
than 
anything 
else, 
without 

necessarily meaning to, “The Big House” 

draws attention to the fact that all of this 

— the parties, the preparations, the alumni, 

the donations, the pomp and circumstance 

— is ultimately in service of watching a game 

play out on a field. When the movie takes a 

short chance to show us the view of the game 

from the sideline, for a second or two the 

audience might think, “All of this, for that?” 

It’s to the great credit of the filmmakers 

that this documentary makes no comment 

on any of the scenes it is providing, but asks 

the audience to draw the commentary on 

their own. The movie ends with what feels 

like a somewhat disconnected segment in 

which University President Mark Schlissel 

explains to wealthy alumni why they should 

continue to donate and thanks them for 

their donations. The film makes no attempt 

to bridge this sequence too much with 

anything that preceded it. It doesn’t need to. 

The audience can do the math.

56TH
ANNUAL
FILM
FESTIVAL

On Wednesday, Mar. 25, Academy 

Award-winning 
Visual 
Effects 

Supervisor 
John 
Nelson 
(“Blade 

Runner: 2049”) gave an illustrated 

lecture on how he and his team created 

some of the 1,200 visual effects shots 

in his most recent Oscar triumph, 

“Blade Runner: 2049.” The festival 

is something of a homecoming for 

Nelson, a Detroit native who attended 

the University. In anticipation of the 

56th installment of the Ann Arbor Film 

Festival, Nelson spoke with The Daily 

over the phone to discuss the festival, 

his films and his career. 

The Michigan Daily: So first 

things first, I think some congrats are 

in order, as you’re a recent Academy 

Award winner. Congratulations, that’s 

incredible.

John Nelson: Thank you, thank 

you! It has been a week, but I think our 

feet are finally sort of coming down 

to Earth now, you know? It has been 

a special week. You know, I won 17 

years ago and I was up twice — I didn’t 

win — and being nominated is a true 

honor, it really is, but winning is really 

something, you know?

TMD: Yeah, absolutely, and I 

imagine that winning an Oscar can’t be 

a feeling you ever really get used to.

JN: Yeah, it’s like, the closest thing 

I can describe it as, is it’s like someone 

has come up behind you with a cattle 

prod and shocked you in the butt with 

10,000 volts. You’re pretty electrified 

from the moment you hear the outcome 

because the whole night everyone is 

nervous until your award — anyone 

that’s up is nervous until the moment 

your award is decided — and you’re 

either gonna be really happy or you’re 

gonna be congratulating the winner 

and then going to the bar.

TMD: So just to clear the air and get 

my fanboy-ish doting over with, I have 

to say: “Blade Runner: 2049” was one 

of my favorite films of the year. I mean, 

growing up watching the original 

film, it was incredible to see what you 

accomplished with this sequel.

JN: Well thank you, thank you, it 

was a true labor of love for everyone 

because everyone had a great deal of 

respect for the original movie and for 

Ridley (Scott, director of the original 

“Blade Runner”). We’re doubly blessed 

because, you know, taking on a movie 

like this is a daunting task because 

you’re trying to do a sequel to a movie 

that is everyone’s favorite movie and 

it’s pretty difficult to do and do well, 

but fortunately for us we had — our 

new director Denis Villeneuve is pretty 

brilliant. So you have a master painter 

with the original, sort of, with Ridley, 

and then you have a new master painter 

with Denis. The reason the movie is 

so deeply felt and so intense is really 

because we have a great team — the 

producers put together a great team, 

and being led by Denis is really special.

TMD: Right, I can imagine. So on 

the topic of the team behind the film, 

if you don’t mind explaining what your 

role is on a project as the Visual Effects 

Supervisor, would you say that’s more 

creatively focused or more technically 

focused?

JN: Overwhelmingly, I think my job 

is to creatively keep the movie on track, 

visual-effects-wise, but half of my job is 

to technically figure out things that are 

either too expensive, too dangerous or 

impossible to do by any other means. 

I’m involved from the beginning of 

pre-production and designing the shots 

through principle photography and 

shooting the shots for what we call our 

plates. A plate is an element that you 

shoot on set and then you combine it 

with a bunch of other elements into 

a finished shot. I’m involved in pre-

production in the design, in working 

out technically how we’re going to be 

fast on set because some of our (shots) 

are incredibly technically challenging. 

The whole point of filmmaking is that 

the technique never overshadows 

the creativity, right, and you try to 

be creatively on-point with the story, 

so whatever you do echoes the story 

and drives it forward, it doesn’t call 

attention to itself as a technique. So I 

would say my job is probably 60 percent 

creative, 40 percent technique, but the 

technical aspect of my job is incredibly 

challenging, and so you find a lot of 

people who are half-engineer, half-

artist doing my work. I come out of the 

camera department so I like to shoot a 

lot of stuff, as many elements as I can 

get, and you try to shoot as much as 

you can during principle photography 

and then in post-production you do 

all the stuff that is necessary, all the 

other elements that are combined 

with the photographic plate you have 

to generate, and in this day and age 

sometimes it’s faster not to have a 

photographic plate at all. I tend to, again 

because I come out of camera, I tend to 

like to have photographic elements — as 

many as I can get — before I go the full 

CG route. 

TMD: One thing that really stood 

out to me about the film is just how 

well the environment tells the story of 

what events transpired in between the 

original film and “2049.” How much of 

a role would you say storytelling plays 

in what you do with VFX?

JN: I think it’s a tremendous thing. I 

mean, everyone who works in the movie 

business is good at craft and technique, 

and they kind of channel all of that 

craft and technique and everything 

they’ve learned and everything they’re 

good at into the service of storytelling. 

If you’re stepping over the line and 

drawing attention to yourself, it’s 

probably the wrong choice, and so 

I think storytelling is always on my 

mind. I will never review a shot outside 

of the cut of the movie, so when I get 

shots back from the effects vendors 

that I work with — and there are eight 

VFX vendors on this shoot — in three 

or four different countries, right, and 

I will always look at it in the cut. The 

cut is how you’re telling the story, how 

you want (the film) to be perceived. 

Storytelling 

is 
immensely 

important, I mean 

you look at the 

cities (in the film), 

but also at Joi or 

Rachael, and it’s 

even more important. 

TMD: So speaking of Joi, her 

character is involved in some of the 

film’s most visually unique moments, 

such as the merging scene with Joi and 

Mariette, where you have them sort of 

superimposed atop one another. Care 

to walk us through how that scene was 

put together?

JN: The merge is my favorite scene 

in the movie, and that was incredibly 

hard to do. It was one of those things 

where, like in many creative endeavors, 

you design it and then you say, “This is 

gonna be good, but we have to do it.” and 

then in the process of doing it you find 

new things that you drill into. For us, 

we shot both women separately, then 

we mapped them out to CG surrogates 

of themselves. Then we blended 

them together and we didn’t want the 

moment, the sequence to climax too 

early — no pun intended — we didn’t 

want the women all of a sudden to just 

go like this and be locked in and be 

perfect. So we had these moments, like 

shots, where it would start out of sync 

and at the end of the shot it would be in 

sync and at the start of the next shot it 

would be out of sync until this moment 

where he grabs her from behind and 

brings her to him and you get like three 

or four shots in a row where you see one 

woman’s performance, then another 

woman’s performance, then their eyes 

line up and they become a third woman 

that also is performing. Because we 

were using only computer graphics 

to supplement the photography we 

were filming, and we only used the 

CG to create a backdrop, like when 

you look through a glass of water you 

see the other side of the glass, that was 

the CG part. The art was in shooting 

and mapping and putting those 

performances together, and when the 

eyes of those women line up it is truly a 

magical moment. I mean, when I saw it, 

I jumped out of my seat and I said, “Yes! 

That is it,” and we have like three shots 

in a row where that happens and it’s 

really my favorite scene in the picture, 

so I always have to talk about it. 

TMD: Speaking as an artist, are 

there any films you can think of that 

have inspired you throughout your 

career or influenced your work?

JN: Oh yeah, big time. You know, 

I grew up in Grosse Pointe Woods, 

and I was the head usher at the Vogue 

Theater on Harper and Cadieux in the 

East Side of Detroit. I watched “2001” 

probably a hundred times, “Fantasia” 

a hundred times, I think both of those 

films have influenced me greatly. As 

I grew up and decided to go to film 

school I watched a lot of David Lean 

movies, which still impress me — 

Denis and I both love David Lean’s 

shots which are big shots with small 

people for grand scale and to show the 

place of the human within this vast 

landscape, right? Plus, those shots are 

tremendously cinematic. John Box, the 

production designer, and David Lean 

they’re just — I mean, if you look at the 

films he made: “Bridge Over the River 

Kwai,” “Lawrence of Arabia,” all of the 

others, he’s just pretty fantastic. Let’s 

see, I’m a big Billy Wilder fan, I’m a big 

Preston Sturges fan, I like the movies 

of the ’30s, a lot of pre-code movies I 

think are really interesting. I like the 

Coen Brothers’ movies, I think they’re 

quite good. I like Chris Nolan’s movies, 

John Nelson on tech, effects 
behind ‘Blade Runner 2049’

MAX MICHALSKY

Daily Arts Writer

I think they’re quite good. But you know, 

Stanley Kubrick had a huge influence on me, 

and I graduated from college in 1976 so I grew 

up watching them. I mean, I think maybe 

the first good movie I saw and realized the 

potential of cinema was “On the Waterfront,” 

I saw it with my family on a black and white 

TV in our living room and it just blew me 

away. “On the Waterfront” is really the power 

of visuals, acting, directing and music all 

together. It just makes this incredibly strong, 

emotional, cerebral statement. 

TMD: You mentioned growing up in the 

Detroit area, and I know you’re a University 

of Michigan alum, so why don’t we take a 

moment to talk about the upcoming Ann 

Arbor Film Festival? 

JN: Sure, you know when I started making 

movies (as a young filmmaker in Ann Arbor) 

I submitted them and they were accepted 

into the Film Festival. As both a screener 

and a filmmaker, I was involved and I think 

the AAFF is a tremendously creatively fertile 

place because there are no rules. The films 

that come in there are sort of oddball films 

that come in at tangential angles and it’s not 

like stuff you’ll see anyplace else. It’s always 

different, and I think it’s incredibly visually 

stimulating, I think that if you take a lot of that 

experimental film — a lot of the viewpoints of 

experimental film have sort of leached into 

society. You get something that could be, you 

know, non-narrative storytelling that could be 

almost kinetic storytelling. It’s really pretty 

interesting. Every year I go to the festival, I 

always walk away going, “Wow, that movie 

really was great,” you know what I mean? 

There’s some movies I don’t like, but there’s 

usually many films that I think are really, 

really, really great, and that’s the great prize of 

Ann Arbor: You have these things that are so 

unique and unusual. 

TMD: Would you say that these sort 

of avant-garde, experimental films may 

forecast what’s to come in the near future of 

filmmaking? 

JN: I think it depends. It depends on 

how on the narrative cycle — like on the 

classic narrative cycle — how mainstream 

entertainment will buy into it. There certainly 

is, with Netflix and Hulu and whatnot, there’s 

more demand in other places. On HBO last 

night I saw one of the shorts that I voted on 

for the short films (at the Academy Awards). 

It was a 20 minute or half-hour film, and in 

the past those films would just get shown 

for Oscar things and then never shown 

again, but now it’s on HBO. Or you look at 

documentaries, like all of the documentaries 

were really good this year. They’re always 

really good, and documentary filmmaking 

used to be kind of a niche. When I was in film 

school people would know about Frederick 

Wiseman and other people like that, the 

Maysles brothers. Now there’s a lot of really 

good documentaries being done all the time, 

and they’re documentaries but they also 

have a real point of view. There are non-

narrative, experimental films leaching into 

society — you want to know where you see it 

a lot? To be honest, you see it a lot in television 

commercials, in stuff like rock videos, stuff 

that is just off-the-wall different. Where 

being more visceral and kinetic is okay, you 

see it a lot there, and that’s really sort of cool. 

I remember reading this one thing on Stanley 

Kubrick that he used to watch commercials 

and some of them he liked quite a bit, and I 

understand that. I mean, most of them are not 

good, of course, but some are really interesting 

in the way that they approach what they’re 

doing and that’s where you see it too. It’s a 

whole new world for creative entertainment 

and there’s a million different places to get 

it. Who knows, in the future, just like there’s 

an old movie channel, Turner, maybe there’ll 

be an experimental film channel and people 

can go there when they want. It has an effect 

when something is striking and tells a story in 

a new and different way, there’s probably an 

audience for it. If you can get enough people to 

see it there probably will be an audience for it.

‘The Big House’

The crowd roars. That familiar voice 

blares across the stadium, “Ladies and 

gentlemen, 
presenting 
the 
Michigan 

marching band ... Band, take the field!” It’s 

a ritual, a Saturday morning tradition, and 

has been the central hub of activity in Ann 

Arbor on weekends for almost a hundred 

years. It’s a University football game at “The 

Big House,” the largest football stadium in 

North America, and now the one with an 

equally large and ambitious documentary 

to boot.

Filmed 
in 
collaboration 
between 

University students, Screen Arts and 

Cultures professors Terri Sarris and Abé 

Markus Nornes and visiting professor 

Kuzahiro Soda, “The Big House” is a 

complete and thorough examination of 

everything that happens on any given 

football Saturday, both on and off the field. 

The film features a number of segments, 

all of which are done in a style that places 

the viewing audience within the action to a 

startling degree. We follow, at various times, 

the band preparing to make its journey 

before the game, the preparations made 

by stadium staff for the visiting opponent, 

the parties and antics of students in the 

hours preceding the event and the trials 

and tribulations of the viewers watching 

the game from the stands as it unfolds. All 

this, and much more. “The Big House” is 

about as complete a depiction of a football 

Saturday in Ann Arbor as one could possibly 

hope for. The only facet of the day that 

appears to be missing is the experience of 

the players themselves, which doubtlessly 

seems like one of the few places in which 

the filmmakers might have had an access 

problem.

Although the various scenes of life in the 

stadium are interesting, strangely enough, it 

is when “The Big House” leaves home that 

the film truly soars. The most engaging and 

interesting segments of the film are the 

one’s that follow the variety of characters 

that populate the streets of Ann Arbor both 

before and after the game. From dancers, 

to people shouting about the town’s sins, 

to a particularly talented and funny street 

side drummer, these people bring a human 

element to the film and add some variety 

and humor to the film’s most entertaining 

segment. 

In other spots, it sometimes feels like the 

movie is repeating familiar beats. There are 

only so many shots of the crowd you can 

show before they all begin to seem the same. 

Some sequences feel like they outlive their 

running time but the film refuses to move 

on from them. Other times individual shots, 

such as one of a kid trying to sell M&Ms 

outside the arena, feel like they could be half 

as long as they are. Such is the nature of this 

style of filmmaking: To give the viewer a 

sense of totality to what they are witnessing. 

It will work for many, but there are some 

who will wish the movie moved a little bit 

faster.

More 
than 
anything 
else, 
without 

necessarily meaning to, “The Big House” 

draws attention to the fact that all of this 

— the parties, the preparations, the alumni, 

the donations, the pomp and circumstance 

— is ultimately in service of watching a game 

play out on a field. When the movie takes a 

short chance to show us the view of the game 

from the sideline, for a second or two the 

audience might think, “All of this, for that?” 

It’s to the great credit of the filmmakers 

that this documentary makes no comment 

on any of the scenes it is providing, but asks 

the audience to draw the commentary on 

their own. The movie ends with what feels 

like a somewhat disconnected segment in 

which University President Mark Schlissel 

explains to wealthy alumni why they should 

continue to donate and thanks them for 

their donations. The film makes no attempt 

to bridge this sequence too much with 

anything that preceded it. It doesn’t need to. 

The audience can do the math.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
4 — Tuesday, March 27, 2018


On Wed., March 14, Maize 

Collective — in partnership with 

Universal 
Music 
Group 
and 

Innovate Blue — hosted the first 

of a series of three music business 

panels titled “Industry Insight: 

Songwriters, Producers and Studio 

Musicians.” Held at the University 

of Michigan Museum of Art’s 

auditorium, the panel provided 

aspiring Ann Arbor artists with tips 

for success in the music business 

and featured an array of musicians, 

including Yungblud, a new signee to 

Geffen Records and rising hip-hop 

star, Evan Haywood, a musician 

and multimedia artist based in 

Ann Arbor, Kasan Belgrave, a Jazz 

Studies sophomore concentrating 

in clarinet and alto sax and DeNero 

Montez, a Detroit native singer and 

songwriter who has written for 

Justin Bieber.

The panel, moderated by Veniece 

Session of Ann Arbor’s Neutral 

Zone, 
addressed 
songwriting 

techniques, 
royalties, 
musical 

influences and the overall daily life 

of a career musician. Yungblud, 

who performed a few hours later 

at the Majestic Theatre in Detroit, 

was given the most immediate 

attention before leaving early for his 

show. His charismatic persona and 

unfiltered stream of consciousness 

was enticing, providing an example 

to the many aspiring musicians 

in the crowd of a young and fresh 

musician who successfully “made 

it” in the music business while 

maintaining 
his 
rambunctious 

attitude. When asked by Session 

— who herself has experience 

working with independent artists 

— if signing to a major label has 

hindered his creative process, 

Yungblud replied, “To be honest, I 

figured out who I was before I got 

signed. And, if you know that and 

you deep down know who you are, 

then how are they going to change 

that? They signed you for a reason, 

because they like you and like your 

sound.”

Next, Session asked Montez 

to elaborate on the songwriting 

process. He offered an easy-

to-comprehend 
explanation 
of 

songwriting and the business of 

copyright, stressing the importance 

of submitting your work to BMI 

(Broadcast Music, Inc.) or ASCAP 

(American Society of Composers, 

Authors and Publishers) as well 

as registering your lyrics with the 

Library of Congress. Haywood also 

interjected, advising the crowd to 

always run paperwork by a lawyer 

before signing, avoiding any chance 

that you as a songwriter would lose 

the rights to your masters.

Later, after Yungblud left for 

his show and the panel grew more 

intimate, the floor opened for 

audience questions and the panel 

was asked to speak on how they 

remain original in their music while 

having artists they admire. Belgrave 

raised a point that was met with 

nods of agreement from both the 

panelists and the audience, saying, 

“Automatically, we are subject to 

music that comes before us so we 

are automatically paying homage 

to music before us. Music is always 

moving, always evolving so I think 

you have to hear things from the 

past to create new sounds.”

The panel closed with Haywood 

offering young musicians a word 

of advice: “Keep making music, 

keep putting it out in any way,” he 

said. “No one will hear it at first 

and eventually you’ll start getting 

traction and building a fan base. 

Those fans will stick with you if 

you’re a nice person. Be kind and 

open and caring. Support your 

friends and make a community. 

Then, when you get that success, 

you will have friends holding you 

up.”

The memory is a subjective 

entity that is so personal and 

biased that it often becomes 

difficult to distinguish memories 

from complete imaginations. The 

idea of the intersection between 

the memory and the imagination 

is probed in the Austrian/German 

film “The Impossible Picture” 

by Sandra Wollner (“Viktor”). 

The picture is constructed in 

disconnected narrative fragments, 

almost vignettes, of everyday life 

in 1950s Vienna in a home where a 

secret women’s circle emerges. The 

title itself probably refers to the 

way that it is not possible to ever 

get the “full picture” of life, due to 

this subjective nature of memory, 

which beguiles the mind, making 

memories themselves unreliable. 

The 
memory 
is 
not 
the 

only unreliable player in “The 

Impossible Picture.” Its narrator 

is unclear and switches, creating 

an ominous and ambiguous tale 

that makes it difficult for the 

audience to understand whose 

story is being told and who is 

telling it. Characters talk in code, 

obsess over death — especially 

the children — and question their 

existence. Formally, the home 

video style, shot on 8mm film, 

makes the characters seem close 

to us. We get an intimate peek into 

their lives, which are filled with 

mystery and taboo. The home 

video camera narrative produced 

by this shaky-cam, grainy film 

effect is joined by broken dialogue 

that cuts in and out. Together, 

these formal elements succeed in 

inserting us into the space of the 

private home, though Wollner 

may have brought us too close.

Wollner doesn’t hold back in 

displaying visceral and graphic 

images on screen, from dead 

animals to bloody innards and 

queasy 
subject-matter. 
With 

these aesthetics, Wollner creates 

a creepy dissonance, especially 

with the lack of a reliable narrator, 

which causes the audience to 

lack trust. Johanna, the possible 

narrator, says herself, “Memory is 

unreliable, it might as well be the 

future.” These existential doubts 

and questions were present on 

the screen, but they were too 

present. The film pushes almost 

too far in the abstract that it 

causes it to be hard to follow. A 

classic experimental film that 

leans maybe too far into the 

experimental, 
“An 
Impossible 

Picture” is an attempt to scrutinize 

the span of the memory, but it leans 

a bit too far toward the abstract for 

any real conclusions to be drawn.

‘Those Who Come, Will

SOPHIA WHITE

The whole truth and nothing 

but the truth. Honesty is the best 

policy. The truth will set you free. 

These 
platitudes, 
immediately 

recognizable to any American, 

emphasize just how much value 

our society places on authenticity. 

However, whether our actions 

align with our perceptions of truth 

is another story entirely. Much 

of America’s history, especially 

that regarding its treatment of 

African-Americans, is built upon 

lies, 
deception 
and 
brutality. 

Beneath a glossy exterior of 

“purple mountain majesties” and 

“amber waves of grain” there is rot, 

a suppressed darkness and a dirty 

and sickening reality that “America 

the beautiful” is much uglier than 

she is portrayed as being. Through 

his 
powerful 
and 
extremely 

personalized documentary, “Did 

You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?,” 

Travis Wilkerson punctures the 

underbelly of the 1940s American 

South, exposing the blatant reality 

of racial hatred and unjust violence 

that lies beneath, remnants of 

which permeate society today. 

Wilkerson begins his work 

with a clear objective: to unveil the 

truth about his great grandfather, 

S.E Branch, a white man guilty of 

murdering Bill Spann, a Black man 

in 1946 rural Ala.. Digging deep 

into his family history, Wilkerson 

travels 
around 
conducting 

interviews with the few willing 

relatives and townspeople he can 

find in hopes of confirming his 

great-grandfather’s 
crimes 
and 

searching for scraps of knowledge 

about Spann. With expert mixing 

of color and black and white 

sequences, use of sound and 

incorporation 
of 
contemporary 

racial content, Wilkerson creates 

an impactful and haunting piece of 

art that leaves audience members 

reflecting long after the lights go 

up. In one of the most intriguing 

and creative segments of the film, 

Wilkerson intersperses old, cheery 

home videos of his grandparents 

and 
extended 
family, 
while 

simultaneously voicing-over the 

certificate of death that was filed 

for Spann’s murder. The loving 

family memories playing on screen 

are representative of the attractive 

surface level illusion of life in 

America at the time. But beneath 

this picture-perfect façade is the 

truth, a murder that really did 

happen, but went unacknowledged 

because the man who lost his life 

was Black.

The film’s perspective is unique 

in that it uses the personal story 

of Wilkerson’s grandfather as a 

vehicle to unpack racism both 

at the time and today. Dispersed 

among 
clips 
unravelling 
the 

mystery 
behind 
Wilkerson’s 

great-grandfather’s 
crime 
are 

other segments reflecting on the 

contemporary 
racial 
situation 

in the United States. Sudden 

interjections of solid, blindingly-

white screens serve as literal 

“wake up calls,” jolting viewers 

to attention. A rhythmic, African-

inspired beat begins to play, as the 

names of African Americans — 

Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin and 

Eric Garner to name a few — who 

recently perished at the hand of 

the law bounce across the screen, 

followed by phrases reading, “Say 

his name” and “Say her name.” 

The words feel like calls to action, 

sending chills down audience 

members’ spines. 

Perhaps most haunting however, 

is the evidence, or lack thereof, that 

Wilkerson collects on Bill Spann. 

Aside from his certificate of death 

and an unmarked grave stone, 

Wilkerson finds next to nothing 

on Spann. No family. No records. 

Nothing. Spann’s existence was 

buried along with him, discarded 

by a society that found no value in 

remembering him. The absence of 

information that Wilkerson obtains 

hints again at the theme of truth, 

or rather its concealment, that 

resurfaces consistently throughout 

the film. Wilkerson connects the 

disregard of Spann’s murder in the 

’40s to the present day, suggesting 

that society still turns a blind eye to 

the reality of injustice and violence 

inflicted upon African Americans. 

Through the link he stresses 

between present and past racial 

climates, 
Wilkerson 
shatters 

the false belief that America is 

living in a post-racial society, 

illustrating that our past has 

in fact become our present. He 

compels viewers to not only hear 

what he has to say, but to listen. 

Ears open, heart pounding and 

blood boiling, audiences are filled 

with frustration at the incredible 

lengths that our nation has gone to 

not only commit, but deceive itself 

of the wrongs committed against 

African Americans. The truth that 

the United States has put off facing 

is a bitter and shameful one. We 

are a nation that fails to protect 

and defend all of our citizens. We 

have failed. But there is still time 

for change, a change that can 

only come when we all “Say their 

names” together. Sandra Bland. 

Trayvon Martin. Eric Garner. To 

“Say their names” is to speak the 

truth, and it is far past time to start 

speaking it. 

‘Did You Ever Wonder 
Who Fired the Gun?’

Lifelong friends and directing 

duo Takuya Dairiki and Takashi 

Miura (“Fine as Usual”) travelled 

to Ann Arbor from Japan — their 

first time ever visiting the United 

States — to compete in the Ann 

Arbor Film Festival. In fact, I had 

the pleasure of sitting next to them 

at the screening. Both men had a 

calm, quiet disposition about them, 

undercut by a palpable excitement 

to show off their work. Their film, 

“Honane,” doesn’t feel like it was 

made for me to see; in fact, it doesn’t 

feel like it was made for anyone, 

and that’s one of the greatest 

compliments I could give this film.

The movie consists of a series 

of phone calls between a man, 

Taro, and his Uncle Hiro. Over the 

phone, the two watch a collection 

of home videos taken by Uncle 

Hiro as he travels through the 

Japanese countryside. The uncle 

and nephew — played by Dairiki 

and Miura and never actually 

shown on camera — have a 

rapport that is immediately 

recognizable as the kind that 

could only come from a decades-

old bond. In a post-screening 

Q&A session, Dairiki and Miura 

explained that when the two were 

young they would wander through 

their neighborhood and shoot 

videos. Not videos of anything in 

particular, just things they found 

fascinating 
or 
important, 
the 

creation of art for its own sake 

rather than for an audience. This 

inspiration is evident throughout 

the film, as it truly feels like it was 

made solely for Taro and Uncle 

Hiro — the audience is just a fly on 

the wall. 

Uncle Hiro in particular is a focal 

point of the film. His camera is our 

lens into this world, and as such we 

are able to learn so much about his 

character solely by what he chooses 

to film. At times, we see the mind of 

a man enthralled with minutiae: 

tiny, condensed shots of the corner 

of a refrigerator, or a notch in a 

wooden handrail. At other times, 

we see a kind of wistful loneliness: 

neon signs for udon shops blinking 

at night, or the mostly-empty 

parking lot of a pachinko parlor. As 

we watch these things he chooses 

to film, we learn about what Hiro 

finds beautiful. In some scenes, 

Hiro’s footage is interlaced with 

the sounds of someone playing 

drums in the distance. He claims 

that this is a drum-playing fairy 

that lives in the woods near his 

home. Watching Hiro’s videos and 

listening to him explain his film 

paints such an incredibly vivid 

image of him, and by the end it feels 

like he’s an old friend. 

The experience of watching 

“Honane” is like someone letting 

you in on a well-kept secret, like an 

existential conversation between 

old friends in the middle of the 

night, like driving with friends 

through your hometown in the 

summer. Watching Uncle Hiro’s 

videos, one can’t help but to think 

of the joy it is to feel connected to 

someone they’ll never meet solely 

through experiencing their art. 

Dairiki and Miura’s film seems 

more intent on communicating 

these 
fleeting, 
undefinable 

thoughts and feelings than it is on 

telling a story; the result is one of 

the most delightful indie films of 

the year.

The description given in the 

Ann Arbor Film Festival directory 

for the experimental Spanish film 

“RONCO RUMOR REMOTO / 

ROUGH REMOTE RUMBLE” is 

not very descriptive. It reads: “A 

stone falls from a wall, rolls down 

to the ground, and suddenly stops. 

At that moment, a cloud with a 

very similar shape passes over.” 

There is no more. There won’t 

be any more. There is nothing 

more to say, at least from the 

filmmakers. 

The 
74-minute, 
dialogue-

less feature does more by saying 

nothing at all; it is a film that 

finds curiosity in fairly mundane 

actions, without relying on any 

pomp or circumstance 

to create situations that 

seem truly at odds with 

normal expectations of 

everyday life. “RONCO” follows 

a man’s quest to recreate the 

shape of a rock he found in an old 

ruinous house out of the remnants 

of a larger ruinous village. It 

seems to deal thematically with 

the presence of patterns in nature, 

displaying on-screen the beauty 

that comes in tandem with a 

mathematically created universe. 

Not unlike how a cluster of 

neurons in the brain may resemble 

a cluster of galaxies across the 

universe, the fundamental pieces 

of this film are fractals — smaller, 

secular buds of some common 

stem. 

And it really is quite a beautiful 

film, however trudging, slow, 

boring, uneventful and quiet it 

may seem. The black-and-white 

cinematography 
collapses 
the 

expansive 
dessert 
landscape 

down upon itself, changing the 

perception of scale and depth 

within the shots. Because much of 

the landscape is indistinguishable, 

it becomes difficult to tell what is 

being shown on screen; the long 

dark striations start to look less 

like the ridges carved in a glacial 

valley, and more like shadows 

formed by a small pile of dirt. The 

camera work is excellent, probably 

the most individually impressive 

piece of the film.

There’s not much to say 

about performances. The three 

characters 
portrayed 
on 
the 

screen never share a word, they 

hardly even interact. The largest 

moment of expression between 

any two of them comes at the 

end, when the protagonist and 

his companion share a moment 

of great raucous laughter after 

pushing a boulder down the side of 

a small mountain. Their laughter 

brings them to tears, and as the 

moment begins to fade to memory, 

so does the screen to black.

‘The Impossible Picture’

Hear’

Language 
extinction, 
to 

many 
Americans, 
is 
often 

something they read about at a 

comfortable 
distance. 
There’s 

a certain empathy that they’re 

lacking for cultures that have 

been erased by the colonialism, 

whether it manifested as outright 

subjugation or more insidiously 

through structures like schools 

or other government mandates. 

Simon Plouffe’s “Those Who 

Come, 
Will 
Hear,” 
which 

premiered at the Ann Arbor Film 

Festival last week, finds speakers 

of Inuit languages near death 

in Quebec, and explores the 

ways they have responded to the 

powers that have eradicated their 

ways of life. 

Plouffe 
profiles 
multiple 

cultures across the expanse of 

Quebec, but his search is never 

shallow. Instead of reducing 

the speakers to their shared 

plight, Plouffe looks at different 

responses of each culture, some 

more hopeful than others: the 

public school system, in one 

circumstance, that is reinstating 

its native language and ensuring 

that young people become literate, 

the bingo radio program that is 

broadcast in an indigenous tongue 

and a moment between mother 

and son as they attempt to recall 

an old prayer from memory.

In its less direct moments, 

“Those Who Come, Will Hear” 

probes the connection between 

land 
and 
livelihood. 
Plouffe 

occasionally abstracts shots of 

nature, distorting the image and 

overlaying ambient sounds and 

monologues 
from 
indigenous 

speakers, who are never named 

individually. 
Instead, 
Plouffe 

focuses on the pure sound of the 

languages, on the intonation and 

pitch. As a result, it seems as if the 

land is speaking for all the voices 

that have been silenced in the 

past.

Despite its focus on a large-

scale social problem, “Those 

Who Come, Will Hear” never 

attempts to proselytize to its 

audience. 
Plouffe 
does 
not 

introduce 
anything 
garish 

or 
confrontational: 
statistics, 

interviews with the government or 

any outsiders to the communities 

he 
visits. 
He 
suggests 
that 

these places are self-sufficient 

and unique, which colonialism 

has always challenged. While 

there are similarities that have 

emerged between the cultures of 

indigenous people and Europeans 

JACK BRANDON

Daily Arts Writer

after years of cultural exchange, 

Plouffe does not whitewash his 

subjects. At one point, a father 

and son discuss the naming 

conventions of tails while the 

father examines the carcass of an 

otter at the dinner table. 

The beauty and honesty of 

“Those Who Come, Will Hear” is 

so beguiling that it becomes easy 

to forget the sadness and tension 

that underpins the speakers’ 

situation. 
Instead, 
Plouffe 

provides a view from the inside 

out. For these speakers, there is 

no use in brooding over the past. 

Resilience and preservation are 

not options — they’re promises.

‘Honane’


On Wed., March 14, Maize 

Collective — in partnership with 

Universal 
Music 
Group 
and 

Innovate Blue — hosted the first 

of a series of three music business 

panels titled “Industry Insight: 

Songwriters, Producers and Studio 

Musicians.” Held at the University 

of Michigan Museum of Art’s 

auditorium, the panel provided 

aspiring Ann Arbor artists with tips 

for success in the music business 

and featured an array of musicians, 

including Yungblud, a new signee to 

Geffen Records and rising hip-hop 

star, Evan Haywood, a musician 

and multimedia artist based in 

Ann Arbor, Kasan Belgrave, a Jazz 

Studies sophomore concentrating 

in clarinet and alto sax and DeNero 

Montez, a Detroit native singer and 

songwriter who has written for 

Justin Bieber.

The panel, moderated by Veniece 

Session of Ann Arbor’s Neutral 

Zone, 
addressed 
songwriting 

techniques, 
royalties, 
musical 

influences and the overall daily life 

of a career musician. Yungblud, 

who performed a few hours later 

at the Majestic Theatre in Detroit, 

was given the most immediate 

attention before leaving early for his 

show. His charismatic persona and 

unfiltered stream of consciousness 

was enticing, providing an example 

to the many aspiring musicians 

in the crowd of a young and fresh 

musician who successfully “made 

it” in the music business while 

maintaining 
his 
rambunctious 

attitude. When asked by Session 

— who herself has experience 

working with independent artists 

— if signing to a major label has 

hindered his creative process, 

Yungblud replied, “To be honest, I 

figured out who I was before I got 

signed. And, if you know that and 

you deep down know who you are, 

then how are they going to change 

that? They signed you for a reason, 

because they like you and like your 

sound.”

Next, Session asked Montez 

to elaborate on the songwriting 

process. He offered an easy-

to-comprehend 
explanation 
of 

songwriting and the business of 

copyright, stressing the importance 

of submitting your work to BMI 

(Broadcast Music, Inc.) or ASCAP 

(American Society of Composers, 

Authors and Publishers) as well 

as registering your lyrics with the 

Library of Congress. Haywood also 

interjected, advising the crowd to 

always run paperwork by a lawyer 

before signing, avoiding any chance 

that you as a songwriter would lose 

the rights to your masters.

Later, after Yungblud left for 

his show and the panel grew more 

intimate, the floor opened for 

audience questions and the panel 

was asked to speak on how they 

remain original in their music while 

having artists they admire. Belgrave 

raised a point that was met with 

nods of agreement from both the 

panelists and the audience, saying, 

“Automatically, we are subject to 

music that comes before us so we 

are automatically paying homage 

to music before us. Music is always 

moving, always evolving so I think 

you have to hear things from the 

past to create new sounds.”

The panel closed with Haywood 

offering young musicians a word 

of advice: “Keep making music, 

keep putting it out in any way,” he 

said. “No one will hear it at first 

and eventually you’ll start getting 

traction and building a fan base. 

Those fans will stick with you if 

you’re a nice person. Be kind and 

open and caring. Support your 

friends and make a community. 

Then, when you get that success, 

you will have friends holding you 

up.”

The memory is a subjective 

entity that is so personal and 

biased that it often becomes 

difficult to distinguish memories 

from complete imaginations. The 

idea of the intersection between 

the memory and the imagination 

is probed in the Austrian/German 

film “The Impossible Picture” 

by Sandra Wollner (“Viktor”). 

The picture is constructed in 

disconnected narrative fragments, 

almost vignettes, of everyday life 

in 1950s Vienna in a home where a 

secret women’s circle emerges. The 

title itself probably refers to the 

way that it is not possible to ever 

get the “full picture” of life, due to 

this subjective nature of memory, 

which beguiles the mind, making 

memories themselves unreliable. 

The 
memory 
is 
not 
the 

only unreliable player in “The 

Impossible Picture.” Its narrator 

is unclear and switches, creating 

an ominous and ambiguous tale 

that makes it difficult for the 

audience to understand whose 

story is being told and who is 

telling it. Characters talk in code, 

obsess over death — especially 

the children — and question their 

existence. Formally, the home 

video style, shot on 8mm film, 

makes the characters seem close 

to us. We get an intimate peek into 

their lives, which are filled with 

mystery and taboo. The home 

video camera narrative produced 

by this shaky-cam, grainy film 

effect is joined by broken dialogue 

that cuts in and out. Together, 

these formal elements succeed in 

inserting us into the space of the 

private home, though Wollner 

may have brought us too close.

Wollner doesn’t hold back in 

displaying visceral and graphic 

images on screen, from dead 

animals to bloody innards and 

queasy 
subject-matter. 
With 

these aesthetics, Wollner creates 

a creepy dissonance, especially 

with the lack of a reliable narrator, 

which causes the audience to 

lack trust. Johanna, the possible 

narrator, says herself, “Memory is 

unreliable, it might as well be the 

future.” These existential doubts 

and questions were present on 

the screen, but they were too 

present. The film pushes almost 

too far in the abstract that it 

causes it to be hard to follow. A 

classic experimental film that 

leans maybe too far into the 

experimental, 
“An 
Impossible 

Picture” is an attempt to scrutinize 

the span of the memory, but it leans 

a bit too far toward the abstract for 

any real conclusions to be drawn.

The movie consists of a series

the film, as it truly feels like it was 

made solely for Taro and Uncle 

Hiro — the audience is just a fly on 

the wall. 

Uncle Hiro in particular is a focal 

point of the film. His camera is our 

lens into this world, and as such we 

are able to learn so much about his 

character solely by what he chooses 

to film. At times, we see the mind of 

a man enthralled with minutiae: 

tiny, condensed shots of the corner 

of a refrigerator, or a notch in a 

wooden handrail. At other times, 

we see a kind of wistful loneliness: 

neon signs for udon shops blinking 

at night, or the mostly-empty 

parking lot of a pachinko parlor. As 

we watch these things he chooses 

to film, we learn about what Hiro 

finds beautiful. In some scenes, 

Hiro’s footage is interlaced with 

the sounds of someone playing 

drums in the distance. He claims 

that this is a drum-playing fairy 

that lives in the woods near his 

home. Watching Hiro’s videos and 

listening to him explain his film 

paints such an incredibly vivid 

image of him, and by the end it feels 

like he’s an old friend. 

The experience of watching 

“Honane” is like someone letting 

you in on a well-kept secret, like an 

existential conversation between 

old friends in the middle of the 

night, like driving with friends 

through your hometown in the 

summer. Watching Uncle Hiro’s 

videos, one can’t help but to think 

of the joy it is to feel connected to 

someone they’ll never meet solely 

through experiencing their art. 

Dairiki and Miura’s film seems 

more intent on communicating 

these 
fleeting, 
undefinable 

thoughts and feelings than it is on 

telling a story; the result is one of 

the most delightful indie films of 

the year.

The description given in the 

Ann Arbor Film Festival directory 

for the experimental Spanish film 

“RONCO RUMOR REMOTO / 

ROUGH REMOTE RUMBLE” is 

not very descriptive. It reads: “A 

stone falls from a wall, rolls down 

to the ground, and suddenly stops. 

At that moment, a cloud with a 

very similar shape passes over.” 

There is no more. There won’t 

be any more. There is nothing 

more to say, at least from the 

filmmakers. 

The 
74-minute, 
dialogue-

less feature does more by saying 

nothing at all; it is a film that 

finds curiosity in fairly mundane 

actions, without relying on any 

pomp or circumstance 

to create situations that 

seem truly at odds with 

normal expectations of 

everyday life. “RONCO” follows 

a man’s quest to recreate the 

shape of a rock he found in an old 

ruinous house out of the remnants 

of a larger ruinous village. It 

seems to deal thematically with 

the presence of patterns in nature, 

displaying on-screen the beauty 

that comes in tandem with a 

mathematically created universe. 

Not unlike how a cluster of 

neurons in the brain may resemble 

a cluster of galaxies across the 

universe, the fundamental pieces 

of this film are fractals — smaller, 

secular buds of some common 

stem. 

And it really is quite a beautiful 

film, however trudging, slow, 

boring, uneventful and quiet it 

may seem. The black-and-white 

cinematography 
collapses 
the 

expansive 
dessert 
landscape 

down upon itself, changing the 

perception of scale and depth 

within the shots. Because much of 

the landscape is indistinguishable, 

it becomes difficult to tell what is 

being shown on screen; the long 

dark striations start to look less 

like the ridges carved in a glacial 

valley, and more like shadows 

formed by a small pile of dirt. The 

camera work is excellent, probably 

the most individually impressive 

piece of the film.

There’s not much to say 

about performances. The three 

characters 
portrayed 
on 
the 

screen never share a word, they 

hardly even interact. The largest 

moment of expression between 

any two of them comes at the 

end, when the protagonist and 

his companion share a moment 

of great raucous laughter after 

pushing a boulder down the side of 

a small mountain. Their laughter 

brings them to tears, and as the 

moment begins to fade to memory, 

so does the screen to black.

‘The Impossible Picture’

Hear’

Language 
extinction, 
to 

many 
Americans, 
is 
often 

something they read about at a 

comfortable 
distance. 
There’s 

a certain empathy that they’re 

lacking for cultures that have 

been erased by the colonialism, 

whether it manifested as outright 

subjugation or more insidiously 

through structures like schools 

or other government mandates. 

Simon Plouffe’s “Those Who 

Come, 
Will 
Hear,” 
which 

premiered at the Ann Arbor Film 

Festival last week, finds speakers 

of Inuit languages near death 

in Quebec, and explores the 

ways they have responded to the 

powers that have eradicated their 

ways of life. 

Plouffe 
profiles 
multiple 

cultures across the expanse of 

Quebec, but his search is never 

shallow. Instead of reducing 

the speakers to their shared 

plight, Plouffe looks at different 

responses of each culture, some 

more hopeful than others: the 

public school system, in one 

circumstance, that is reinstating 

its native language and ensuring 

that young people become literate, 

the bingo radio program that is 

broadcast in an indigenous tongue 

and a moment between mother 

and son as they attempt to recall 

an old prayer from memory.

In its less direct moments, 

“Those Who Come, Will Hear” 

probes the connection between 

land 
and 
livelihood. 
Plouffe 

occasionally abstracts shots of 

nature, distorting the image and 

overlaying ambient sounds and 

monologues 
from 
indigenous 

speakers, who are never named 

individually. 
Instead, 
Plouffe 

focuses on the pure sound of the 

languages, on the intonation and 

pitch. As a result, it seems as if the 

land is speaking for all the voices 

that have been silenced in the 

past.

Despite its focus on a large-

scale social problem, “Those 

Who Come, Will Hear” never 

attempts to proselytize to its 

audience. 
Plouffe 
does 
not 

introduce 
anything 
garish 

or 
confrontational: 
statistics, 

interviews with the government or 

any outsiders to the communities 

he 
visits. 
He 
suggests 
that 

these places are self-sufficient 

and unique, which colonialism 

has always challenged. While 

there are similarities that have 

emerged between the cultures of 

indigenous people and Europeans 

JACK BRANDON

Daily Arts Writer

after years of cultural exchange, 

Plouffe does not whitewash his 

subjects. At one point, a father 

and son discuss the naming 

conventions of tails while the 

father examines the carcass of an 

otter at the dinner table. 

The beauty and honesty of 

“Those Who Come, Will Hear” is 

so beguiling that it becomes easy 

to forget the sadness and tension 

that underpins the speakers’ 

situation. 
Instead, 
Plouffe 

provides a view from the inside 

out. For these speakers, there is 

no use in brooding over the past. 

Resilience and preservation are 

not options — they’re promises.

An intersectional analysis of the blackface Snapchat

CRITICAL ETHNIC STUDIES AND A/PIA STUDIES GRADUATE AND FACULTY GROUP | OP-ED

W

atching 
“Love, 

Simon” 
felt 
like 

arriving at a long-

awaited destination. 
Something 
that 
I 
had 
been 

anticipating 
since 

my first encounter 
with a young adult 
movie, 
pretending 

that 
the 
vanilla, 

heterosexual 
leads 

weren’t 
actually 

heterosexual. 
And 
finally, 
when 

it 
manifested 
in 

the film starring actor Nick 
Robinson 
as 
the 
closeted-

gay high school senior, it was 
everything. And still, it will 
never be enough.

Within the past three years, 

films with queer people, mostly 
gay cisgender men, have emerged 
into the mainstream. Last year’s 
Best Picture, “Moonlight,” was 
the first Best Picture winner 
revolving around an LGBTQ+-
themed story (not to mention 
a solely Black cast). This year, 
“Call Me By Your Name,” a film 
about an Italian-Jewish boy 
falling in love with an older 
American man, was nominated 
for numerous accolades.

Yet these movies, despite 

having 
the 
themes 
that 

accompany 
typical 
coming-

of-age 
stories, 
were 
still 

thematically heavy. Their target 
audiences 
were 
inevitably 

mature, with aesthetics and 
plots more concurrent with the 
conventions of an art-house 
movie. 
Conversely, 
“Love, 

Simon” 
follows 
the 
weepy, 

popcorn-indulgent and corny 
customs of an archetypal young 
adult movie.

I grew up watching Edward 

and Bella in “Twilight” recite 
lines that were cliché and stiff 
as cardboard, and I ate it up. I 
witnessed the histrionics that 
ensued after actress Emma Stone 
lied about losing her virginity 
in “Easy A,” and recited every 
quote in “The Fault in Our Stars” 
that filled theaters with sobbing 
adolescents.

While some of these movies 

did have deeply moving, tragic 
elements (see “The Fault in Our 
Stars”), they were all swollen 
with 
unrealistic 
melodrama 

meant to send hoards of teens to 

theaters. “Moonlight,” “Blue is 
the Warmest Color” and other 
LGBTQ+-oriented films depict 

the 
raw 
truth 
of 

being queer.

Just 
as 
these 

movies 
were 

necessary 
vehicles 

for the stories of real 
queer lives, so too is 
“Love, Simon,” and 
it’s something I felt 
like I always needed. 
I needed a cheesy 
story that had humor 
and heartbreak with 

a character who also felt pinned 
down by the burdens of keeping 
his sexuality a secret.

Walking 
out 
of 
“Love, 

Simon” felt gratifying. The film 
focuses on a gay teenager coming 
to terms with his sexuality and 
navigating his way out of the 
closet. It is also a love story, 
one which revolves around the 
email correspondence between 
him and the anonymous “Blue,” 
a fellow closeted student at his 
school. It’s also, remarkably, the 
first major studio movie to focus 
on a gay teenager.

I have grown up being 

taught that my sexuality is 
either a tragedy or a commodity. 
Each 
cinematic 
experience 

exhibits either the fraught life of 
someone queer in the form of a 
tragic drama or reduces the gay 
experience by portraying queer 
men as acerbic, sassy friends.

Finally, 
an 
entertaining, 

romantic 
teen 
comedy 

that 
somehow 
managed 
to 

encapsulate the truth of coming 
out while still making my 
friends and me giggle, weep and 
fawn over the attractive leads 
like any other movie. In one 
scene, right after Simon comes 
out to his straight girlfriend, 
she instructs him on how to talk 
about cute boys.

The palpable awkwardness 

but 
ultimate 
triumph 
of 

Simon figuring it out was both 
delightfully corny and acutely 
genuine. It further exemplified 
the movie’s ability to be just 
a little too sentimental while 
still circumscribing Simon as a 
relatable character. 

For me, this movie felt long-

awaited, yet for a gay teen who 
hasn’t come out for whatever 
reason, it elucidates a message 

that, 
while 
mightily 
cliché, 

is very important: It does get 
better.

Are there aspects of the 

movie I wish could have been 
done differently? Of course. 
To begin with, the use of a 
masculine, cisgender white male 
in a fairly liberal area as a coming 
out story can barely be viewed 
as a proxy for universal tales of 
coming out. Furthermore, the 
use of a Black, gay character 
who has very little dimension 
and feels somewhat contrived 
from stereotype is a little less 
than desired.

In fact, prior to seeing “Love, 

Simon,” this was the preeminent 
misgiving I had with the film. 
From the onset, it seemed to 
engage minimally with actual 
queer culture, instead opting for 
a movie that was palatable for 
straight audiences.

However, it was bucking 

those 
same 
audiences 
who, 

for years, have weaponized 
gay 
representation 
as 
a 

pernicious form of normalizing 
homosexuality (as I’ve said, I 
have seen nearly every young 
adult 
movie 
with 
straight 

protagonists, and I have yet to 
magically become straight).

In 
the 
end, 
it 
still 

incorporated aspects of being 
queer, 
from 
the 
struggles 

of coming out to a musical 
number 
featuring 
singer 

Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna 
Dance 
With 
Somebody.” 

Perhaps it wasn’t as much 
Houston as I wanted (frankly, 
I’m still waiting for a movie 
that features an intense lip 
sync battle to her classic “So 
Emotional”), and it may not 
have 
been 
revolutionary, 

but it was an incremental 
step in breaking down the 
barriers 
that 
have 
been 

erected by homophobia and 
misunderstanding.

And for LGBTQ+ teenagers, 

whom are twice as likely 
to attempt suicide as their 
straight peers, the wonder of 
seeing themselves illuminated 
on screen will provide hope 
for their futures and validate 
their identities.

D

ear 
communities 
of 

the 
University 
of 

Michigan,

In light of the current 

news 
regarding 
students 

donning blackface to mock 
#BlackLivesMatter 
on 

Snapchat, there is an uneasy 
silence around the apparent 
presence 
of 
the 
Asian/

Asian-American 
student 
in 

the photo. As students and 
scholars 
of 
Critical 
Ethnic 

Studies 
and 
Asian/Pacific 

Islander American Studies, 
we present this letter to offer 
an 
intersectional 
analysis 

of the image as a means 
to 
better 
understand 
the 

layers of mal-intent present 
in the photo. We voice our 
concerns in solidarity with 
#BlackLivesMatter, Black and 
African-American students, in 
hopes of opening pathways for 
healing and justice.

The black masks in the 

Snapchat appear to be part of 
an Asian beauty fad that cleans 
the pores (the blackness of the 
mask stands for the cleansing 
properties 
of 
charcoal 
and 

also refers to the removal of 
blackheads), 
meaning 
that 

the “joke” intended by the 
Snapchat works operates on at 
least two levels. The students 
effectively make fun of both 
#BlackLivesMatter 
and 
the 

Asian beauty product, a kind 
of humor that relies on notions 
of Asians as being ignorant 
and indifferent to American 
racism. And though the face 
mask itself is not intended 
to be used for blackface, the 
caption of the Snapchat turns 
the mask into one. The image 
turns harmful for the ways 
it mocks the important work 
of #BlackLivesMatter and its 
trenchant 
critique 
of 
anti-

Blackness, 
police 
brutality, 

mass incarceration and the 
racist judicial system of the 
United States. 

Even though the Asian/Asian-

American student is essentially 
silent and, in a way, made into 
an accessory in support of the 
racist 
Snapchat, 
the 
student 

is 
nonetheless 
complicit 
in 

constructing this racist image. 
The ease with which he stands 
next to and in support of LSA 
sophomore 
Lauren 
Fokken 

activates a deep history of the 
“model 
minority” 
myth 
and 

its 
roots 
in 
anti-Blackness 

and 
white 
supremacy, 
and 

more recently, efforts to derail 
#BlackLivesMatter 
by 
Asian-

American communities through 
the support of Peter Liang and his 
murder of Akai Gurley.

The image further erases 

the 
history 
of 
coalitional 

activism in the 1960s and 1970s 
when the very identity “Asian 
American” arose in solidarity 
with the civil rights movement. 
Given the acts of violence and 
erasures that the Snapchat 
enacts with regards to the 
racist criminal justice system 
of this moment, police brutality 
and the mass incarceration of 
Black Americans, we wonder 
about the punitive measures 
that this racist act seems to 
warrant. What response do we 
desire from the two students 
that would alleviate the pain 
of these variously affected and 
subjugated populations at the 
University? 
What 
response 

from the University would be 
satisfying? After all, this is a 
matter of social justice and 
academic integrity.

One of the ways white 

supremacy works on us is 
through individualizing acts of 
violence that effectively reduce 
systemic issues of inequality 
into individual acts. When 
working with such ideas of 
the individual, the solutions 
to violence seem to warrant 
punishment 
and 
extrication 

from the community. However, 
if we have learned anything 

from the legacy of the civil 
rights movement, the anti-
Vietnam war movement, the 
anti-poverty 
movement 
and 

the women’s movement, justice 
works better when it serves to 
heal communities, to call in the 
very individuals who harm us 
in an act of re-imagining what 
community means. We are 
left to labor harder to build 
connections where they seem 
most impossible, so that we 
might redirect our anger at 
the structures that oppress all 
of us.

Many 
structural 
issues 

come to mind: no alternative 
processes 
that 
achieve 
the 

aims of affirmative action, 
insufficient 
programs 
for 

recruiting undergraduate and 
graduate students of color, 
lack of new tenure lines in 
ethnic 
studies 
departments, 

the insufficiency of race and 
ethnicity course requirements. 
The individual acts of racism 
on campus speak to far larger 
structural issues of inequality 
and 
reflect 
the 
current 

climate of inequality at the 
University. The justice that we 
seek is one that moves toward 
raising the consciousness of 
our 
community 
members, 

re-evaluating the purpose of 
higher education as one not 
geared 
toward 
maximizing 

one’s earning potential or access 
to pleasure, but toward building 
a civically engaged community 
that has an expressed interest 
in the ethics that govern how 
we should relate to one another 
across difference.

Be careful what you wear

CARLI COSENZA | COLUMN

I

f you’ve been out and about 
in the past couple of years, 
chances are you’ve come 

across some form of “Reagan-Bush 
’84” apparel. Whether it’s a hat, 
laptop sticker or shirt, the vintage 
campaign logo has made a revival 
in mainstream fashion today. The 
design, which originally was used 
during 
then-President 
Ronald 

Reagan and then-Vice President 
George H.W. Bush’s campaign (and 
their re-election), has re-emerged 
today with the idea in mind to 
“commemorate the dominance of 
Reagan’s conservatism.” Apparel 
can be bought just about anywhere, 
from Amazon to Etsy, where the 
items are so popular that they are 
listed among the sites’ best sellers.

The unique aspect of the 

Reagan-Bush 
’84 
logo 
is 
its 

appeal not only among today’s 
conservatives, but its popularity 
in modern fashion. The design is 
often worn as a “retro look.” It is 
described by Amazon sellers as 
“funny vintage retro style” and 
“lighthearted, nostalgic parody 
appeal.” However, I can’t help but 
wonder if fashion, and consumers, 
are 
missing 
the 
mark 
here. 

Specifically, I wonder if today’s 
buyers are actually aware of the 
policies enacted during Reagan’s 
time as president of the United 
States. I want to take a moment 
to address the harmful impact 
that Reagan’s racially-motivated 
policies had on the civil rights 
movement and particularly the 
lives of Black Americans. Fashion 
or not, the words that we wear 
carry a message — are we aware 
of the racist policies behind the 
Reagan-Bush ’84 logo? Maybe 
if more people were, the trend 
wouldn’t be so popular.

Reagan’s 
presidency 
lasted 

from 1981 until 1989. During his 
time in office, he was able to launch 
an attack on the civil rights agenda 
that should be enough reason alone 
for modern consumers to stop 
wearing their support for him. 
Let’s take a look at some of his most 
damaging racist policies:

1) 
Through 
his 
rhetoric, 

Reagan supported racism with 
remarks that characterized poor, 
Black women as “welfare queens” 
who “drove pink Cadillacs.” Not 
only are these statements seriously 
offensive, but they are also just 
plainly, 
embarrassingly 
wrong. 

There are 52 million Americans on 
welfare, according to a 2012 census 
bureau study, and many of them are 
children who can’t even drive a car, 
let alone a “pink Cadillac.” 

2) President Reagan sought to 

limit the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
which aimed to overcome legal 
barriers at the state and local level 
that prevented African Americans 
from exercising their right to vote 
under the 15th Amendment. He 
vetoed reforms on the act, labeling 
it as “humiliating” to the South.

3) One of Reagan’s campaign 

promises was for less government 
intervention. Apparently, he sought 
to accomplish this goal through 
racist means. For example, he 
slashed important programs such 
as the Comprehensive Employment 
and Training Act, which “provided 
needed assistance to Black people.”

4) Despite being remembered 

as the president who made Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day a federal 
holiday, Reagan should also be 
remembered as someone who 
continuously 
questioned 
the 

integrity of civil rights leaders. He 
stated, “Sometimes I wonder if they 
really mean what they say, because 
some of those leaders are doing 
very well leading organizations 
based on keeping alive the feeling 
that they’re victims of prejudice.” 
Did he really suggest that racially-
based prejudice doesn’t exist? 
That’s not an idea that we should 
be proudly representing on our 
clothing today.

5) Reagan tried to allow Bob 

Jones University, a historically 
segregated Southern school, to 
reclaim federal tax credits that 
had long been denied to “racially 
discriminatory institutions.” So, 
his standpoint on institutionalized 
racism is pretty clear: He not only 
did nothing to stop it, but actually 
attempted to perpetuate it, at least 

in this case.

6) In an effort to silence the 

voices of Black workers, Reagan 
ordered the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to shelve discrimination 
claims by Black farmers.

7) And, as if all of the above 

behavior doesn’t seem troubling 
enough, 
Reagan 
considered 

apartheid South Africa a “friend 
and an ally.” He even permitted 
American corporate support for 
the racist regime. In 1981, after 
pressure from Black leaders and 
organizations, Congress passed 
a bill of sanctions against South 
Africa. Reagan vetoed that.

The list could go on and on, 

but this would be a much longer 
piece in that case. But by now, it 
should be pretty clear: Many of the 
policies under Reagan were very, 
very racist. His agenda was not to 
support the civil rights movement, 
but to attack its participants and 
limit its success.

Personally, I am unable to see 

past the reality of Reagan’s damaging 
policies in the name of “retro” 
fashion. There is nothing wrong with 
wearing what you want to wear and 
everyone should have the freedom to 
do so. But as conscious consumers, we 
have to look at the bigger picture. As 
modern philosopher Lars Svendsen 
puts it, fashion is “one of the most 
influential phenomena in Western 
civilization since the renaissance.” 
So, if you choose to wear a Reagan-
Bush ’84 shirt, what are you 
representing? If you knew more 
about the racist policies behind the 
Reagan administration, would you 
continue to wear a shirt promoting 
his presidential candidacy?

I would hope that the popularity 

of the Reagan-Bush ’84 logo is due to 
the modern consumer’s ignorance 
about Reagan’s racist policies, rather 
than in support of them. If we want 
any chance at confronting modern-
day racism, we should stop endorsing 
the racist policies of the past and 
pick a new fashion trend.

N

othing 
summons 
up 

visions 
of 
Valentine’s 

Day like roses, a box 

of chocolates or a roundtable on 
international law and justice. On 
Feb. 14, the University of Michigan 
International 
Institute 
hosted 

a roundtable to commemorate 
the closing of the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia in 2017 after 24 years 
of 
international 
justice. 
This 

roundtable event looked at whether 
the future of international law 
and justice is brighter due to the 
ICTY. I agree with Law professor 
Steven Ratner, who claimed that 
instead of seeing the glass as half 
full or half empty, the glass is only 
5 percent full. 

The ICTY was established by 

the United Nations Security Council 
in 1993 following the outbreak of 
violence and conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. The 
mission of the ICTY was to try 
and prosecute those involved in 
committing human rights atrocities 
such as genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes.

Some 
of 
the 
University’s 

brightest minds in human rights and 
international law gathered on the 
10th floor of Weiser Hall to discuss 
the successes and failures of the 
ICTY and the future of international 
justice. Among these experts were 
John Ciorciari, associate professor 

of Public Policy, research associate 
Robert Donia and Ratner, joined by 
Dermot Groome, a law professor at 
Pennsylvania State University.

Ratner qualified his rather 

pessimistic view of a drop of water in 
the bottom of the cup by adding that 
the ICTY does still have redeeming 
qualities. Before the ICTY there was 
no glass.

Progress has been made in 

international law and justice and the 
ICTY is greatly responsible for some 
of this progress. Before the ICTY, 
the most recent trials prosecuting 
war crimes were the Nuremberg 
trials and Tokyo War Crimes trials 
following World War II. Like Ratner 
said at the panel on Wednesday, 
without the ICTY, it would still 
be considered acceptable to grant 
amnesty to human rights criminals. 
This is no small accomplishment.

However, the ICTY did not 

accomplish its long-term and most 
important goal of preventing future 
human rights crimes. The ICTY was 
not able to deter actors in the Balkan 
Wars from committing war crimes 
and human rights violations in the 
eight years following its creation. 
Bosnian Serbs murdered thousands 
of Muslims in the Srebrenica 
Massacre of 1995. Even those 
being held directly accountable in 
the ICTY were not deterred from 
committing these crimes. There 
was never a hope of it deterring 

actors around the world from doing 
the same.

Today, we still see mass 

atrocities throughout the world. 
In Syria, Bashar al-Assad has used 
chemical weapons and barrel bombs 
against civilian populations. The 
Rohingya are being discriminated 
against and driven from their homes 
in Myanmar, leading to over half a 
million Rohingya refugees. Human 
rights violations and war crimes are 
being committed daily around the 
globe with no perceived effect from 
the ICTY.

In 
1948, 
the 
Universal 

Declaration of Human Rights was 
recognized as the global standard 
by the United Nations, yet to this 
day we continue to see its principles 
of equality and security ignored. 
While we live in a world where the 
human rights of a single person 
are violated, the United Nations 
cannot consider itself successful in 
protecting the human rights of the 
global community.

The ICTY was not enough to 

establish a standard of respect for 
human rights in the global context. 
It is the United Nations’s and every 
world leader’s responsibility to 
hold their allies and enemies to the 
UDHR in all their actions and punish 
those that do not with international 
pressure and sanctions.

Lack of effort at fault for Wolverines’ defeat

There 
was 
an 
18-game 

winning streak on the line at 
the top of the seventh inning 
for the No. 17 Michigan softball 
team.

But that didn’t matter to the 

players. All they wanted was to 
beat Iowa.

And while the Wolverines’ 

late efforts pulled close, it 
wasn’t enough as they fell to 
the Hawkeyes, 4-3.

“It was a fight, we put all 

of our hearts out on the line, 
but the biggest thing was 
we started a little late,” said 
freshman 
designated 
player 

Lou Allan. “We picked up our 
energy a little too late. If we 
could maintain that energy 
from first pitch to the last pitch 
it would help us a lot.”

It was evident Michigan had 

the skill to win against Iowa, as 
they had done so just a couple 
hours before in a 4-1 win over 
the Hawkeyes. However, the 
problem lied with the timing of 
the effort.

It wasn’t until the fifth 

inning that the Wolverines 
looked like they were ready to 
play.

Before the top of the fifth, 

there 
were 
two 
three-up-

three-down innings and two 
one-hit innings for Michigan, 
who was unable to start its 
offensive game plan — getting 
the ball to the ground.

“We 
had 
a 
really 
good 

gameplan going in there, and 
we didn’t stick to the game 
plan,” said senior right-hander 
Tera Blanco. “And that was 
another one of our weaknesses 
that was highlighted. That’s 
something that we’ve been 
working on our last few days of 
practices.”

However, in the top of the 

fifth, the scoring drought for 
the Wolverines — who found 
themselves trailing by two — 
ended with an RBI single from 
junior second baseman Faith 

Canfield.

In past games, once the score 

opened up, it would avalanche 
down all at once. Against 
Iowa’s pitching, 
however, 
Michigan 
couldn’t 
repeat 

its 
typical 

scoring trend.

Finding 

themselves in a 
four-run deficit 
and 
down 
to 

their 
final 
set 

of 
outs, 
the 

Wolverines 
finally found the 
missing urgency. 

“We were having a lot of 

good at bats, but we were giving 
away a lot of innings earlier 
in the game by not having the 
good at-bats in the last inning,” 
Blanco said. “Towards the end 
of the innings, a lot of people 
started to turn it on, but we 
needed that a little earlier.”

Freshman shortstop Natalia 

Rodriguez walked up to the 
plate. As Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins notes, Rodriguez has 
a “certain swag” about her that 

makes her live for the pressure-
filled moments. Despite that 
unwavering 
confidence, 

Rodriguez, as the leadoff hitter, 

couldn’t 
find 

the 
necessary 

contact to help 
the 
offense 

— taking the 
first 
out 
of 

the inning on 
a failed bunt 
attempt.

After 
that, 

thanks 
to 

a 
Hawkeye 

error, Canfield 
hustled 
her 

way to first. With a single from 
junior 
centerfielder 
Natalie 

Peters, Michigan began seeing 
hope. As Blanco hit a single to 
right field, the Wolverines saw 
more than hope — they saw 
loaded bases with only one out.

Then, senior outfielder Aidan 

Falk struck out swinging on 
three straight pitches, and the 
momentum took a step back.

The 
pressure 
started 
to 

mount.

But with two straight walks, 

hope returned. There was only 

a one-run differential with 
loaded bases. Despite the lack 
of energy early, there was no 
better chance to be fired up 
than now.

Sophomore 
outfielder 

Haley Hoogenraad had shown 
offensive 
improvements 

throughout the season. She had 
always been a great defensive 
player, but now had the time to 
show the strides she’s made on 
the other end.

But it was not to be.
Swinging on the first pitch, 

she saw it sail in the air but 
fall lazily into the shortstop’s 
glove. It was the final out.

Despite the attempt at a 

comeback, the team felt the 
loss was one they could have 
avoided. To them, it was just a 
matter of effort.

“We started to work the 

count and swing at some more 
pitches and things started to go 
our way,” Blanco said. “The last 
inning highlighted that we are 
good enough, we are a really 
good team, we just need to 
prove it. We need to come out 
like that and not wait until the 
last inning to do that.”

Michigan splits against 
Iowa, has streak ended

For a half inning Friday 

night, the string of bad luck 
periling the No. 17 Michigan 
softball team’s 18-game win 
streak was almost rendered 
moot.

Even though senior right 

hander Tera Blanco gave up just 
four hits in the second game of 
the series against Iowa, all four 
yielded runs for the Hawkeyes. 
A storm had already pushed the 
game from Saturday to Friday 
night, and the Wolverines were 
facing a storm of their own.

With the team down 4-1 

at the top of the seventh, 
sophomore 
center 
fielder 

Natalie Peters sent a ground 
ball right down the third base 
line. Blanco followed it up with 
a hit above first base to load the 
bases.

Two walks and two unearned 

runs later, it seemed like the 
game was just another drop in 
the water, that it was inevitable 
for Michigan to come back and 
extend its win streak.

In 
softball 
though, 

opportunities, 
win 
streaks, 

even in-game hot streaks are 
fragile. Every great storyline 
and every bad moment can be 
punctuated by a singular pitch 
or hit.

When 
sophomore 
Haley 

Hoogenraad lifted a fly ball 
into the mitt of Hawkeye left 
fielder Cheyenne Pratt, nothing 
else mattered. Nevermind the 
mini-rally in the bottom of the 
seventh inning.

Nevermind the game earlier 

in 
the 
day, 
where 
Blanco 

mashed 
a 
three-run 
home 

run and freshman left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien picked up 
her 16th win in a 4-1 victory. 
In the context of the streak, 
everything was over. All that 
mattered was the score: Iowa 4, 

Michigan 3.

In the case of the Wolverines, 

however, that context is useless.

“I don’t think we talked 

about the streak to be honest,” 
Peters said. “None of us really 
talked about it, or even said 
anything about it. I think the 
best thing that we do is that 
we play one pitch, one softball 
game at a time. I think that 
was huge, I think when we find 
ourselves going away from that 
is when we’ll find trouble.”

Michigan heads back to Ann 

Arbor with a few things in its 
luggage, one of them being 
unfinished business. The bad 
weather ended up cancelling 
the final game of the series. 
For now, there’s no chance to 
immediately brush away the 
taste of defeat.

“Coming to this school, you 

know that weather is always 
going to be a factor,” said 
freshman 
designated 
hitter 

Lou Allan. “It’s something that 
you have to play into, and you 
have to roll with the punches 
basically. The fact that the 
game was cancelled was … we 
wanted to come out and get 
revenge and win the series, but 
stuff happens, and that’s the 
way it goes.”

The Wolverines can now 

look forward to their first Big 
Ten home series against Purdue 
with a renewed sense of focus 
on the micro-aspects of the 
game over the magnanimity of 
a win streak. There is clarity 
for the road ahead.

“Winning was a lot of fun 

because it makes everything 
better,” Blanco said. “But even 
when we were winning, we 
still had a lot to work on, and 
losing to Iowa that second 
game opened our eyes, it 
really highlighted a lot of our 
weaknesses. I think that was 
kind of what we needed to 
improve.”

‘M’ blows out Spartans, 11-0, to complete sweep

Freshman right-hander Jeff 

Criswell blew a pitch right past 
Michigan State’s Adam Proctor 
for the strikeout. It was a fitting 
way for the Michigan baseball 
team to wrap up its three-game 
sweep of its in-state rival.

The Wolverines outscored the 

Spartans 26-4 over the course of 
the series, including an 11-0 beat 
down Sunday afternoon. Backed 
by sophomore right-hander Karl 
Kauffmann’s six innings of five-
hit, scoreless ball, Michigan (3-0 
Big Ten, 12-11 overall) moved 
to above .500 for the first time 
since its first series of the season.

Now owners of an eight-game 

win streak, the Wolverines’ 
confidence is trending upwards 
as conference play continues.

“This is a totally different 

team from a week and a half 
ago,” Kauffmann said. “To come 
out here and get a sweep in the 
first week of Big Ten play — 
moving forward that is going to 
be huge.”

Michigan began the game on 

a strong note, putting up two 
runs in the first inning. After 
junior 
outfielder 
Jonathan 

Engelmann laced an RBI single 
up the middle, junior outfielder 
Miles Lewis stepped up to the 
plate.

With two outs in the inning, 

Engelmann was running on 
contact. Lewis lifted a fly ball 
to left field, and as the Michigan 
State left fielder charged in for 
the ball, the wind knocked it 
down quicker than he expected. 
He dove late, and the ball rolled 
by him. Engelmann scored, and 
Lewis advanced to third after 
the center fielder, backing up on 
the play, let the ball roll by him 
as well.

The 
Wolverines 
strung 

together 
series 
of 
hits 

throughout 
the 
game 
to 

manufacture runs.

While Michigan played well 

from top to bottom on offense, 
perhaps no one had a better 
game than freshman shortstop 
Jack Blomgren — who went 

3-for-4 on the day, including his 
first career home run.

“You get days like today 

where you can see what he’s 
capable of doing,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “You just 
want him to be able to be as 
consistent with that as possible. 
… He’s a consistent worker, he’s 
got a great attitude, he’s a tough 
kid. He brings all the intangibles 
to the table.”

With 
the 

Wolverines 
up 

4-0 
heading 

into 
the 

bottom of the 
fourth 
inning, 

Blomgren 
dug 

in to the batter’s 
box to lead off 
the 
inning. 

After 
ripping 

a 
single 
over 

the 
shortstop 

into left field in his first at-bat, 
Blomgren went up looking to 
swing — and swing he did, as the 
ball flew over the brick wall in 
left field.

“When Jack Blomgren hit the 

home run, that was kinda like a 
stab-in-the-heart type of move 
for them, just capping (off) the 
weekend,” Kauffmann said.

Michigan would score again 

in the inning on junior third 
baseman Blake Nelson’s RBI 
double, and then put up a four-
spot in the sixth inning to go up 
10-0.

Kauffmann, all the while, was 

dealing; the Spartans couldn’t 
buy a sound at-bat.

“When he attacks the strike 

zone, he’s gonna be successful,” 
Bakich said. “He got into a little 
bit of trouble early in this game 

– 
even 
though 

they didn’t get 
any runs – with 
just pitch count, 
having 
some 

three-ball counts 
and 
whatever. 

But 
when 
he’s 

on the attack, he 
gets a lot of quick 
outs. … He’s put 
together 
a 
lot 

of nice, quality 

starts this season.”

The way Kauffmann’s day 

ended perfectly echoes Bakich’s 
assessment of his outing. With 
two outs in the sixth inning, 
Kauffmann faced a bases-loaded 
situation. Instead of buckling 
under the pressure, Kauffmann 
threw a couple of pitches right 
past the Michigan State hitter 
on his way to a strike out, his 

fifth and final on the day.

Once Kauffmann exited the 

ball 
game, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

bullpen did its job and closed out 
the game without allowing a run 
in three innings.

“When you get quality starts 

from your starting pitching, the 
bullpen wants to come in and 
keep that momentum going,” 
Bakich said. “They see the 
blueprint of what’s worked and 
so they have an idea of how to 
attack.”

Following 
the 
victory, 

Michigan looks to continue not 
only the baseball team’s recent 
success, but the successes many 
of 
the 
University’s 
athletic 

teams have seen.

“We all came into today so fired 

up about basketball and hockey 
that we just wanted to represent 
the block ‘M’ and contribute in 
anyway that we could,” Bakich 
said. “It’s just great to be a part 
of this athletic department and 
to wear the block ‘M.’ Our guys, 
they feel that.

“They want to contribute to 

all the positive mojo that the 
entire athletic department has 
right now. … If we can come 
out and sweep our rival and 
contribute as well, we certainly 
wanted to do that.”

Michigan pefects rare 
double suicide squeeze

Tied 1-1 in the top of the 

ninth 
inning 
of 
Saturday’s 

outing against Michigan State, 
outfielder Miles Lewis stepped 
up to the plate with teammates 
on second and third and one out.

The Spartans might not have 

known what was coming, but the 
Wolverines knew exactly what 
the situation called for.

As Michigan State’s Mitchell 

Tyranski was delivering the 
fourth pitch of Lewis’ at bat, 
Michigan’s runners were on 
the move. Junior outfielder 
Jonathan Engelmann sprinted 
home from third, while infielder 
Blake Nelson used his sizable 
lead off second to catapult 
himself towards third. Now it 
was up to Lewis.

Lewis laid down a bunt which 

the Spartan catcher, Nic Locayo, 
was forced to field. Engelmann 
snuck in behind Locayo to give 
the Wolverines their first lead of 
the game, 2-1. And yet, the play 
was still developing. Neglecting 
Nelson, who was now rounding 
third, Locayo threw Lewis out 
at first. By now, everyone was 
aware of Michigan’s trickery. 
To the dismay of Michigan 
State fans in attendance though, 
Nelson beat the throw home to 
increase the lead to two.

“(Michigan) 
coach 
(Erik) 

Bakich was going to give me 
the green light for the first 
strike,” Lewis said. “He dumped 
a curveball in there. It was a 
pretty good pitch so I didn’t 
want that one. Then once it got 
to the 2-1 count, that’s when 
he put on the double squeeze. 
(Engelmann) and Blake did a 
good job of getting good jumps 
and scoring on that, so yeah, it 
was a fun play. It’s a rare play. 
But yeah, very fun.”

The double suicide squeeze 

may be a rare occurrence for 
most teams, but the Wolverines 
have already used it successfully 
this season.

In the first game of Michigan’s 

series against Bowling Green — 

coincidentally the beginning of 
its seven-game win streak — the 
bottom of the fifth inning gave 
rise to circumstances similar to 
Saturday’s.

Tied 6-6 with one out and 

runners on second and third, 
freshman 
shortstop 
Jack 

Blomgren had also been given 
the green light from Bakich. 
Nelson — this time on third — 
and freshman outfielder Jordan 
Nwogu — on second — took off 
on the first pitch. Blomgren 
laid down the squeeze and, like 
Saturday, the Falcons’ catcher 
was forced to field it. Nelson slid 
into home comfortably, and the 
throw to first allowed Nwogu to 
give the Wolverines a two-run 
advantage.

“It’s just a designed play to 

score two runs,” Bakich said. 
“Most of the time, the defense 
collects the out at first base and, 
if they do, without checking the 
runner you have the chance to 
score two runs.”

The all-or-nothing move has 

been a small but important part 
of Michigan’s greater initiative 
to get on base and manufacture 
runs creatively. The team has 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 

running the bases aggressively 
and using its speed to its 
advantage.

“It’s a play we’ve ran many 

times in the past six years,” 
Bakich said. “Don’t know if we 
had to pull it out last year with 
the offense that we had. We 
had a little bit more power in 
our offense, some older veteran 
players. With this year’s offense 
still finding our footing and 
finding the best consistency 
we can in the lineup, we’re still 
going to have to look for ways to 
create that offense.”

But 
now 
that 
they’ve 

employed the double suicide 
squeeze twice, the Wolverines 
may need to change up its 
offensive attack.

“We probably can’t use it ever 

again, because it’s gonna be on 
all the scouting reports here 
on out,” Bakich said with a wry 
smile.

56TH
ANNUAL
FILM
FESTIVAL

On Wednesday, Mar. 25, Academy 

Award-winning 
Visual 
Effects 

Supervisor 
John 
Nelson 
(“Blade 

Runner: 2049”) gave an illustrated 

lecture on how he and his team created 

some of the 1,200 visual effects shots 

in his most recent Oscar triumph, 

“Blade Runner: 2049.” The festival 

is something of a homecoming for 

Nelson, a Detroit native who attended 

the University. In anticipation of the 

56th installment of the Ann Arbor Film 

Festival, Nelson spoke with The Daily 

over the phone to discuss the festival, 

his films and his career. 

The Michigan Daily: So first 

things first, I think some congrats are 

in order, as you’re a recent Academy 

Award winner. Congratulations, that’s 

incredible.

John Nelson: Thank you, thank 

you! It has been a week, but I think our 

feet are finally sort of coming down 

to Earth now, you know? It has been 

a special week. You know, I won 17 

years ago and I was up twice — I didn’t 

win — and being nominated is a true 

honor, it really is, but winning is really 

something, you know?

TMD: Yeah, absolutely, and I 

imagine that winning an Oscar can’t be 

a feeling you ever really get used to.

JN: Yeah, it’s like, the closest thing 

I can describe it as, is it’s like someone 

has come up behind you with a cattle 

prod and shocked you in the butt with 

10,000 volts. You’re pretty electrified 

from the moment you hear the outcome 

because the whole night everyone is 

nervous until your award — anyone 

that’s up is nervous until the moment 

your award is decided — and you’re 

either gonna be really happy or you’re 

gonna be congratulating the winner 

and then going to the bar.

TMD: So just to clear the air and get 

my fanboy-ish doting over with, I have 

to say: “Blade Runner: 2049” was one 

of my favorite films of the year. I mean, 

growing up watching the original 

film, it was incredible to see what you 

accomplished with this sequel.

JN: Well thank you, thank you, it 

was a true labor of love for everyone 

because everyone had a great deal of 

respect for the original movie and for 

Ridley (Scott, director of the original 

“Blade Runner”). We’re doubly blessed 

because, you know, taking on a movie 

like this is a daunting task because 

you’re trying to do a sequel to a movie 

that is everyone’s favorite movie and 

it’s pretty difficult to do and do well, 

but fortunately for us we had — our 

new director Denis Villeneuve is pretty 

brilliant. So you have a master painter 

with the original, sort of, with Ridley, 

and then you have a new master painter 

with Denis. The reason the movie is 

so deeply felt and so intense is really 

because we have a great team — the 

producers put together a great team, 

and being led by Denis is really special.

TMD: Right, I can imagine. So on 

the topic of the team behind the film, 

if you don’t mind explaining what your 

role is on a project as the Visual Effects 

Supervisor, would you say that’s more 

creatively focused or more technically 

focused?

JN: Overwhelmingly, I think my job 

is to creatively keep the movie on track, 

visual-effects-wise, but half of my job is 

to technically figure out things that are 

either too expensive, too dangerous or 

impossible to do by any other means. 

I’m involved from the beginning of 

pre-production and designing the shots 

through principle photography and 

shooting the shots for what we call our 

plates. A plate is an element that you 

shoot on set and then you combine it 

with a bunch of other elements into 

a finished shot. I’m involved in pre-

production in the design, in working 

out technically how we’re going to be 

fast on set because some of our (shots) 

are incredibly technically challenging. 

The whole point of filmmaking is that 

the technique never overshadows 

the creativity, right, and you try to 

be creatively on-point with the story, 

so whatever you do echoes the story 

and drives it forward, it doesn’t call 

attention to itself as a technique. So I 

would say my job is probably 60 percent 

creative, 40 percent technique, but the 

technical aspect of my job is incredibly 

challenging, and so you find a lot of 

people who are half-engineer, half-

artist doing my work. I come out of the 

camera department so I like to shoot a 

lot of stuff, as many elements as I can 

get, and you try to shoot as much as 

you can during principle photography 

and then in post-production you do 

all the stuff that is necessary, all the 

other elements that are combined 

with the photographic plate you have 

to generate, and in this day and age 

sometimes it’s faster not to have a 

photographic plate at all. I tend to, again 

because I come out of camera, I tend to 

like to have photographic elements — as 

many as I can get — before I go the full 

CG route. 

TMD: One thing that really stood 

out to me about the film is just how 

well the environment tells the story of 

what events transpired in between the 

original film and “2049.” How much of 

a role would you say storytelling plays 

in what you do with VFX?

JN: I think it’s a tremendous thing. I 

mean, everyone who works in the movie 

business is good at craft and technique, 

and they kind of channel all of that 

craft and technique and everything 

they’ve learned and everything they’re 

good at into the service of storytelling. 

If you’re stepping over the line and 

drawing attention to yourself, it’s 

probably the wrong choice, and so 

I think storytelling is always on my 

mind. I will never review a shot outside 

of the cut of the movie, so when I get 

shots back from the effects vendors 

that I work with — and there are eight 

VFX vendors on this shoot — in three 

or four different countries, right, and 

I will always look at it in the cut. The 

cut is how you’re telling the story, how 

you want (the film) to be perceived. 

Storytelling 

is 
immensely 

important, I mean 

you look at the 

cities (in the film), 

but also at Joi or 

Rachael, and it’s 

even more important. 

TMD: So speaking of Joi, her 

character is involved in some of the 

film’s most visually unique moments, 

such as the merging scene with Joi and 

Mariette, where you have them sort of 

superimposed atop one another. Care 

to walk us through how that scene was 

put together?

JN: The merge is my favorite scene 

in the movie, and that was incredibly 

hard to do. It was one of those things 

where, like in many creative endeavors, 

you design it and then you say, “This is 

gonna be good, but we have to do it.” and 

then in the process of doing it you find 

new things that you drill into. For us, 

we shot both women separately, then 

we mapped them out to CG surrogates 

of themselves. Then we blended 

them together and we didn’t want the 

moment, the sequence to climax too 

early — no pun intended — we didn’t 

want the women all of a sudden to just 

go like this and be locked in and be 

perfect. So we had these moments, like 

shots, where it would start out of sync 

and at the end of the shot it would be in 

sync and at the start of the next shot it 

would be out of sync until this moment 

where he grabs her from behind and 

brings her to him and you get like three 

or four shots in a row where you see one 

woman’s performance, then another 

woman’s performance, then their eyes 

line up and they become a third woman 

that also is performing. Because we 

were using only computer graphics 

to supplement the photography we 

were filming, and we only used the 

CG to create a backdrop, like when 

you look through a glass of water you 

see the other side of the glass, that was 

the CG part. The art was in shooting 

and mapping and putting those 

performances together, and when the 

eyes of those women line up it is truly a 

magical moment. I mean, when I saw it, 

I jumped out of my seat and I said, “Yes! 

That is it,” and we have like three shots 

in a row where that happens and it’s 

really my favorite scene in the picture, 

so I always have to talk about it. 

TMD: Speaking as an artist, are 

there any films you can think of that 

have inspired you throughout your 

career or influenced your work?

JN: Oh yeah, big time. You know, 

I grew up in Grosse Pointe Woods, 

and I was the head usher at the Vogue 

Theater on Harper and Cadieux in the 

East Side of Detroit. I watched “2001” 

probably a hundred times, “Fantasia” 

a hundred times, I think both of those 

films have influenced me greatly. As 

I grew up and decided to go to film 

school I watched a lot of David Lean 

movies, which still impress me — 

Denis and I both love David Lean’s 

shots which are big shots with small 

people for grand scale and to show the 

place of the human within this vast 

landscape, right? Plus, those shots are 

tremendously cinematic. John Box, the 

production designer, and David Lean 

they’re just — I mean, if you look at the 

films he made: “Bridge Over the River 

Kwai,” “Lawrence of Arabia,” all of the 

others, he’s just pretty fantastic. Let’s 

see, I’m a big Billy Wilder fan, I’m a big 

Preston Sturges fan, I like the movies 

of the ’30s, a lot of pre-code movies I 

think are really interesting. I like the 

Coen Brothers’ movies, I think they’re 

quite good. I like Chris Nolan’s movies, 

John Nelson on tech, effects 
behind ‘Blade Runner 2049’

MAX MICHALSKY

Daily Arts Writer

I think they’re quite good. But you know, 

Stanley Kubrick had a huge influence on me, 

and I graduated from college in 1976 so I grew 

up watching them. I mean, I think maybe 

the first good movie I saw and realized the 

potential of cinema was “On the Waterfront,” 

I saw it with my family on a black and white 

TV in our living room and it just blew me 

away. “On the Waterfront” is really the power 

of visuals, acting, directing and music all 

together. It just makes this incredibly strong, 

emotional, cerebral statement. 

TMD: You mentioned growing up in the 

Detroit area, and I know you’re a University 

of Michigan alum, so why don’t we take a 

moment to talk about the upcoming Ann 

Arbor Film Festival? 

JN: Sure, you know when I started making 

movies (as a young filmmaker in Ann Arbor) 

I submitted them and they were accepted 

into the Film Festival. As both a screener 

and a filmmaker, I was involved and I think 

the AAFF is a tremendously creatively fertile 

place because there are no rules. The films 

that come in there are sort of oddball films 

that come in at tangential angles and it’s not 

like stuff you’ll see anyplace else. It’s always 

different, and I think it’s incredibly visually 

stimulating, I think that if you take a lot of that 

experimental film — a lot of the viewpoints of 

experimental film have sort of leached into 

society. You get something that could be, you 

know, non-narrative storytelling that could be 

almost kinetic storytelling. It’s really pretty 

interesting. Every year I go to the festival, I 

always walk away going, “Wow, that movie 

really was great,” you know what I mean? 

There’s some movies I don’t like, but there’s 

usually many films that I think are really, 

really, really great, and that’s the great prize of 

Ann Arbor: You have these things that are so 

unique and unusual. 

TMD: Would you say that these sort 

of avant-garde, experimental films may 

forecast what’s to come in the near future of 

filmmaking? 

JN: I think it depends. It depends on 

how on the narrative cycle — like on the 

classic narrative cycle — how mainstream 

entertainment will buy into it. There certainly 

is, with Netflix and Hulu and whatnot, there’s 

more demand in other places. On HBO last 

night I saw one of the shorts that I voted on 

for the short films (at the Academy Awards). 

It was a 20 minute or half-hour film, and in 

the past those films would just get shown 

for Oscar things and then never shown 

again, but now it’s on HBO. Or you look at 

documentaries, like all of the documentaries 

were really good this year. They’re always 

really good, and documentary filmmaking 

used to be kind of a niche. When I was in film 

school people would know about Frederick 

Wiseman and other people like that, the 

Maysles brothers. Now there’s a lot of really 

good documentaries being done all the time, 

and they’re documentaries but they also 

have a real point of view. There are non-

narrative, experimental films leaching into 

society — you want to know where you see it 

a lot? To be honest, you see it a lot in television 

commercials, in stuff like rock videos, stuff 

that is just off-the-wall different. Where 

being more visceral and kinetic is okay, you 

see it a lot there, and that’s really sort of cool. 

I remember reading this one thing on Stanley 

Kubrick that he used to watch commercials 

and some of them he liked quite a bit, and I 

understand that. I mean, most of them are not 

good, of course, but some are really interesting 

in the way that they approach what they’re 

doing and that’s where you see it too. It’s a 

whole new world for creative entertainment 

and there’s a million different places to get 

it. Who knows, in the future, just like there’s 

an old movie channel, Turner, maybe there’ll 

be an experimental film channel and people 

can go there when they want. It has an effect 

when something is striking and tells a story in 

a new and different way, there’s probably an 

audience for it. If you can get enough people to 

see it there probably will be an audience for it.

‘The Big House’

The crowd roars. That familiar voice 

blares across the stadium, “Ladies and 

gentlemen, 
presenting 
the 
Michigan 

marching band ... Band, take the field!” It’s 

a ritual, a Saturday morning tradition, and 

has been the central hub of activity in Ann 

Arbor on weekends for almost a hundred 

years. It’s a University football game at “The 

Big House,” the largest football stadium in 

North America, and now the one with an 

equally large and ambitious documentary 

to boot.

Filmed 
in 
collaboration 
between 

University students, Screen Arts and 

Cultures professors Terri Sarris and Abé 

Markus Nornes and visiting professor 

Kuzahiro Soda, “The Big House” is a 

complete and thorough examination of 

everything that happens on any given 

football Saturday, both on and off the field. 

The film features a number of segments, 

all of which are done in a style that places 

the viewing audience within the action to a 

startling degree. We follow, at various times, 

the band preparing to make its journey 

before the game, the preparations made 

by stadium staff for the visiting opponent, 

the parties and antics of students in the 

hours preceding the event and the trials 

and tribulations of the viewers watching 

the game from the stands as it unfolds. All 

this, and much more. “The Big House” is 

about as complete a depiction of a football 

Saturday in Ann Arbor as one could possibly 

hope for. The only facet of the day that 

appears to be missing is the experience of 

the players themselves, which doubtlessly 

seems like one of the few places in which 

the filmmakers might have had an access 

problem.

Although the various scenes of life in the 

stadium are interesting, strangely enough, it 

is when “The Big House” leaves home that 

the film truly soars. The most engaging and 

interesting segments of the film are the 

one’s that follow the variety of characters 

that populate the streets of Ann Arbor both 

before and after the game. From dancers, 

to people shouting about the town’s sins, 

to a particularly talented and funny street 

side drummer, these people bring a human 

element to the film and add some variety 

and humor to the film’s most entertaining 

segment. 

In other spots, it sometimes feels like the 

movie is repeating familiar beats. There are 

only so many shots of the crowd you can 

show before they all begin to seem the same. 

Some sequences feel like they outlive their 

running time but the film refuses to move 

on from them. Other times individual shots, 

such as one of a kid trying to sell M&Ms 

outside the arena, feel like they could be half 

as long as they are. Such is the nature of this 

style of filmmaking: To give the viewer a 

sense of totality to what they are witnessing. 

It will work for many, but there are some 

who will wish the movie moved a little bit 

faster.

More 
than 
anything 
else, 
without 

necessarily meaning to, “The Big House” 

draws attention to the fact that all of this 

— the parties, the preparations, the alumni, 

the donations, the pomp and circumstance 

— is ultimately in service of watching a game 

play out on a field. When the movie takes a 

short chance to show us the view of the game 

from the sideline, for a second or two the 

audience might think, “All of this, for that?” 

It’s to the great credit of the filmmakers 

that this documentary makes no comment 

on any of the scenes it is providing, but asks 

the audience to draw the commentary on 

their own. The movie ends with what feels 

like a somewhat disconnected segment in 

which University President Mark Schlissel 

explains to wealthy alumni why they should 

continue to donate and thanks them for 

their donations. The film makes no attempt 

to bridge this sequence too much with 

anything that preceded it. It doesn’t need to. 

The audience can do the math.

4 — Tuesday, March 27, 2018


On Wed., March 14, Maize 

Collective — in partnership with 

Universal 
Music 
Group 
and 

Innovate Blue — hosted the first 

of a series of three music business 

panels titled “Industry Insight: 

Songwriters, Producers and Studio 

Musicians.” Held at the University 

of Michigan Museum of Art’s 

auditorium, the panel provided 

aspiring Ann Arbor artists with tips 

for success in the music business 

and featured an array of musicians, 

including Yungblud, a new signee to 

Geffen Records and rising hip-hop 

star, Evan Haywood, a musician 

and multimedia artist based in 

Ann Arbor, Kasan Belgrave, a Jazz 

Studies sophomore concentrating 

in clarinet and alto sax and DeNero 

Montez, a Detroit native singer and 

songwriter who has written for 

Justin Bieber.

The panel, moderated by Veniece 

Session of Ann Arbor’s Neutral 

Zone, 
addressed 
songwriting 

techniques, 
royalties, 
musical 

influences and the overall daily life 

of a career musician. Yungblud, 

who performed a few hours later 

at the Majestic Theatre in Detroit, 

was given the most immediate 

attention before leaving early for his 

show. His charismatic persona and 

unfiltered stream of consciousness 

was enticing, providing an example 

to the many aspiring musicians 

in the crowd of a young and fresh 

musician who successfully “made 

it” in the music business while 

maintaining 
his 
rambunctious 

attitude. When asked by Session 

— who herself has experience 

working with independent artists 

— if signing to a major label has 

hindered his creative process, 

Yungblud replied, “To be honest, I 

figured out who I was before I got 

signed. And, if you know that and 

you deep down know who you are, 

then how are they going to change 

that? They signed you for a reason, 

because they like you and like your 

sound.”

Next, Session asked Montez 

to elaborate on the songwriting 

process. He offered an easy-

to-comprehend 
explanation 
of 

songwriting and the business of 

copyright, stressing the importance 

of submitting your work to BMI 

(Broadcast Music, Inc.) or ASCAP 

(American Society of Composers, 

Authors and Publishers) as well 

as registering your lyrics with the 

Library of Congress. Haywood also 

interjected, advising the crowd to 

always run paperwork by a lawyer 

before signing, avoiding any chance 

that you as a songwriter would lose 

the rights to your masters.

Later, after Yungblud left for 

his show and the panel grew more 

intimate, the floor opened for 

audience questions and the panel 

was asked to speak on how they 

remain original in their music while 

having artists they admire. Belgrave 

raised a point that was met with 

nods of agreement from both the 

panelists and the audience, saying, 

“Automatically, we are subject to 

music that comes before us so we 

are automatically paying homage 

to music before us. Music is always 

moving, always evolving so I think 

you have to hear things from the 

past to create new sounds.”

The panel closed with Haywood 

offering young musicians a word 

of advice: “Keep making music, 

keep putting it out in any way,” he 

said. “No one will hear it at first 

and eventually you’ll start getting 

traction and building a fan base. 

Those fans will stick with you if 

you’re a nice person. Be kind and 

open and caring. Support your 

friends and make a community. 

Then, when you get that success, 

you will have friends holding you 

up.”

The memory is a subjective 

entity that is so personal and 

biased that it often becomes 

difficult to distinguish memories 

from complete imaginations. The 

idea of the intersection between 

the memory and the imagination 

is probed in the Austrian/German 

film “The Impossible Picture” 

by Sandra Wollner (“Viktor”). 

The picture is constructed in 

disconnected narrative fragments, 

almost vignettes, of everyday life 

in 1950s Vienna in a home where a 

secret women’s circle emerges. The 

title itself probably refers to the 

way that it is not possible to ever 

get the “full picture” of life, due to 

this subjective nature of memory, 

which beguiles the mind, making 

memories themselves unreliable. 

The 
memory 
is 
not 
the 

only unreliable player in “The 

Impossible Picture.” Its narrator 

is unclear and switches, creating 

an ominous and ambiguous tale 

that makes it difficult for the 

audience to understand whose 

story is being told and who is 

telling it. Characters talk in code, 

obsess over death — especially 

the children — and question their 

existence. Formally, the home 

video style, shot on 8mm film, 

makes the characters seem close 

to us. We get an intimate peek into 

their lives, which are filled with 

mystery and taboo. The home 

video camera narrative produced 

by this shaky-cam, grainy film 

effect is joined by broken dialogue 

that cuts in and out. Together, 

these formal elements succeed in 

inserting us into the space of the 

private home, though Wollner 

may have brought us too close.

Wollner doesn’t hold back in 

displaying visceral and graphic 

images on screen, from dead 

animals to bloody innards and 

queasy 
subject-matter. 
With 

these aesthetics, Wollner creates 

a creepy dissonance, especially 

with the lack of a reliable narrator, 

which causes the audience to 

lack trust. Johanna, the possible 

narrator, says herself, “Memory is 

unreliable, it might as well be the 

future.” These existential doubts 

and questions were present on 

the screen, but they were too 

present. The film pushes almost 

too far in the abstract that it 

causes it to be hard to follow. A 

classic experimental film that 

leans maybe too far into the 

experimental, 
“An 
Impossible 

Picture” is an attempt to scrutinize 

the span of the memory, but it leans 

a bit too far toward the abstract for 

any real conclusions to be drawn.

‘Those Who Come, Will

SOPHIA WHITE

Daily Arts Writer

The whole truth and nothing 

but the truth. Honesty is the best 

policy. The truth will set you free. 

These 
platitudes, 
immediately 

recognizable to any American, 

emphasize just how much value 

our society places on authenticity. 

However, whether our actions 

align with our perceptions of truth 

is another story entirely. Much 

of America’s history, especially 

that regarding its treatment of 

African-Americans, is built upon 

lies, 
deception 
and 
brutality. 

Beneath a glossy exterior of 

“purple mountain majesties” and 

“amber waves of grain” there is rot, 

a suppressed darkness and a dirty 

and sickening reality that “America 

the beautiful” is much uglier than 

she is portrayed as being. Through 

his 
powerful 
and 
extremely 

personalized documentary, “Did 

You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?,” 

Travis Wilkerson punctures the 

underbelly of the 1940s American 

South, exposing the blatant reality 

of racial hatred and unjust violence 

that lies beneath, remnants of 

which permeate society today. 

Wilkerson begins his work 

with a clear objective: to unveil the 

truth about his great grandfather, 

S.E Branch, a white man guilty of 

murdering Bill Spann, a Black man 

in 1946 rural Ala.. Digging deep 

into his family history, Wilkerson 

travels 
around 
conducting 

interviews with the few willing 

relatives and townspeople he can 

find in hopes of confirming his 

great-grandfather’s 
crimes 
and 

searching for scraps of knowledge 

about Spann. With expert mixing 

of color and black and white 

sequences, use of sound and 

incorporation 
of 
contemporary 

racial content, Wilkerson creates 

an impactful and haunting piece of 

art that leaves audience members 

reflecting long after the lights go 

up. In one of the most intriguing 

and creative segments of the film, 

Wilkerson intersperses old, cheery 

home videos of his grandparents 

and 
extended 
family, 
while 

simultaneously voicing-over the 

certificate of death that was filed 

for Spann’s murder. The loving 

family memories playing on screen 

are representative of the attractive 

surface level illusion of life in 

America at the time. But beneath 

this picture-perfect façade is the 

truth, a murder that really did 

happen, but went unacknowledged 

because the man who lost his life 

was Black.

The film’s perspective is unique 

in that it uses the personal story 

of Wilkerson’s grandfather as a 

vehicle to unpack racism both 

at the time and today. Dispersed 

among 
clips 
unravelling 
the 

mystery 
behind 
Wilkerson’s 

great-grandfather’s 
crime 
are 

other segments reflecting on the 

contemporary 
racial 
situation 

in the United States. Sudden 

interjections of solid, blindingly-

white screens serve as literal 

“wake up calls,” jolting viewers 

to attention. A rhythmic, African-

inspired beat begins to play, as the 

names of African Americans — 

Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin and 

Eric Garner to name a few — who 

recently perished at the hand of 

the law bounce across the screen, 

followed by phrases reading, “Say 

his name” and “Say her name.” 

The words feel like calls to action, 

sending chills down audience 

members’ spines. 

Perhaps most haunting however, 

is the evidence, or lack thereof, that 

Wilkerson collects on Bill Spann. 

Aside from his certificate of death 

and an unmarked grave stone, 

Wilkerson finds next to nothing 

on Spann. No family. No records. 

Nothing. Spann’s existence was 

buried along with him, discarded 

by a society that found no value in 

remembering him. The absence of 

information that Wilkerson obtains 

hints again at the theme of truth, 

or rather its concealment, that 

resurfaces consistently throughout 

the film. Wilkerson connects the 

disregard of Spann’s murder in the 

’40s to the present day, suggesting 

that society still turns a blind eye to 

the reality of injustice and violence 

inflicted upon African Americans. 

Through the link he stresses 

between present and past racial 

climates, 
Wilkerson 
shatters 

the false belief that America is 

living in a post-racial society, 

illustrating that our past has 

in fact become our present. He 

compels viewers to not only hear 

what he has to say, but to listen. 

Ears open, heart pounding and 

blood boiling, audiences are filled 

with frustration at the incredible 

lengths that our nation has gone to 

not only commit, but deceive itself 

of the wrongs committed against 

African Americans. The truth that 

the United States has put off facing 

is a bitter and shameful one. We 

are a nation that fails to protect 

and defend all of our citizens. We 

have failed. But there is still time 

for change, a change that can 

only come when we all “Say their 

names” together. Sandra Bland. 

Trayvon Martin. Eric Garner. To 

“Say their names” is to speak the 

truth, and it is far past time to start 

speaking it. 

‘Did You Ever Wonder 
Who Fired the Gun?’

SAMANTHA NELSON

Daily Arts Writer

Lifelong friends and directing 

duo Takuya Dairiki and Takashi 

Miura (“Fine as Usual”) travelled 

to Ann Arbor from Japan — their 

first time ever visiting the United 

States — to compete in the Ann 

Arbor Film Festival. In fact, I had 

the pleasure of sitting next to them 

at the screening. Both men had a 

calm, quiet disposition about them, 

undercut by a palpable excitement 

to show off their work. Their film, 

“Honane,” doesn’t feel like it was 

made for me to see; in fact, it doesn’t 

feel like it was made for anyone, 

and that’s one of the greatest 

compliments I could give this film.

The movie consists of a series 

of phone calls between a man, 

Taro, and his Uncle Hiro. Over the 

phone, the two watch a collection 

of home videos taken by Uncle 

Hiro as he travels through the 

Japanese countryside. The uncle 

and nephew — played by Dairiki 

and Miura and never actually 

shown on camera — have a 

rapport that is immediately 

recognizable as the kind that 

could only come from a decades-

old bond. In a post-screening 

Q&A session, Dairiki and Miura 

explained that when the two were 

young they would wander through 

their neighborhood and shoot 

videos. Not videos of anything in 

particular, just things they found 

fascinating 
or 
important, 
the 

creation of art for its own sake 

rather than for an audience. This 

inspiration is evident throughout 

the film, as it truly feels like it was 

made solely for Taro and Uncle 

Hiro — the audience is just a fly on 

the wall. 

Uncle Hiro in particular is a focal 

point of the film. His camera is our 

lens into this world, and as such we 

are able to learn so much about his 

character solely by what he chooses 

to film. At times, we see the mind of 

a man enthralled with minutiae: 

tiny, condensed shots of the corner 

of a refrigerator, or a notch in a 

wooden handrail. At other times, 

we see a kind of wistful loneliness: 

neon signs for udon shops blinking 

at night, or the mostly-empty 

parking lot of a pachinko parlor. As 

we watch these things he chooses 

to film, we learn about what Hiro 

finds beautiful. In some scenes, 

Hiro’s footage is interlaced with 

the sounds of someone playing 

drums in the distance. He claims 

that this is a drum-playing fairy 

that lives in the woods near his 

home. Watching Hiro’s videos and 

listening to him explain his film 

paints such an incredibly vivid 

image of him, and by the end it feels 

like he’s an old friend. 

The experience of watching 

“Honane” is like someone letting 

you in on a well-kept secret, like an 

existential conversation between 

old friends in the middle of the 

night, like driving with friends 

through your hometown in the 

summer. Watching Uncle Hiro’s 

videos, one can’t help but to think 

of the joy it is to feel connected to 

someone they’ll never meet solely 

through experiencing their art. 

Dairiki and Miura’s film seems 

more intent on communicating 

these 
fleeting, 
undefinable 

thoughts and feelings than it is on 

telling a story; the result is one of 

the most delightful indie films of 

the year.

The description given in the 

Ann Arbor Film Festival directory 

for the experimental Spanish film 

“RONCO RUMOR REMOTO / 

ROUGH REMOTE RUMBLE” is 

not very descriptive. It reads: “A 

stone falls from a wall, rolls down 

to the ground, and suddenly stops. 

At that moment, a cloud with a 

very similar shape passes over.” 

There is no more. There won’t 

be any more. There is nothing 

more to say, at least from the 

filmmakers. 

The 
74-minute, 
dialogue-

less feature does more by saying 

nothing at all; it is a film that 

finds curiosity in fairly mundane 

actions, without relying on any 

pomp or circumstance 

to create situations that 

seem truly at odds with 

normal expectations of 

everyday life. “RONCO” follows 

a man’s quest to recreate the 

shape of a rock he found in an old 

ruinous house out of the remnants 

of a larger ruinous village. It 

seems to deal thematically with 

the presence of patterns in nature, 

displaying on-screen the beauty 

that comes in tandem with a 

mathematically created universe. 

Not unlike how a cluster of 

neurons in the brain may resemble 

a cluster of galaxies across the 

universe, the fundamental pieces 

of this film are fractals — smaller, 

secular buds of some common 

stem. 

And it really is quite a beautiful 

film, however trudging, slow, 

boring, uneventful and quiet it 

may seem. The black-and-white 

cinematography 
collapses 
the 

expansive 
dessert 
landscape 

down upon itself, changing the 

perception of scale and depth 

within the shots. Because much of 

the landscape is indistinguishable, 

it becomes difficult to tell what is 

being shown on screen; the long 

dark striations start to look less 

like the ridges carved in a glacial 

valley, and more like shadows 

formed by a small pile of dirt. The 

camera work is excellent, probably 

the most individually impressive 

piece of the film.

There’s not much to say 

about performances. The three 

characters 
portrayed 
on 
the 

screen never share a word, they 

hardly even interact. The largest 

moment of expression between 

any two of them comes at the 

end, when the protagonist and 

his companion share a moment 

of great raucous laughter after 

pushing a boulder down the side of 

a small mountain. Their laughter 

brings them to tears, and as the 

moment begins to fade to memory, 

so does the screen to black.

through structures like schools 

or other government mandates. 

Simon Plouffe’s “Those Who 

Come, 
Will 
Hear,” 
which 

premiered at the Ann Arbor Film 

Festival last week, finds speakers 

of Inuit languages near death 

in Quebec, and explores the 

ways they have responded to the 

powers that have eradicated their 

ways of life. 

Plouffe 
profiles 
multiple 

cultures across the expanse of 

Quebec, but his search is never 

shallow. Instead of reducing 

the speakers to their shared 

plight, Plouffe looks at different 

responses of each culture, some 

more hopeful than others: the 

public school system, in one 

circumstance, that is reinstating 

its native language and ensuring 

that young people become literate, 

the bingo radio program that is 

broadcast in an indigenous tongue 

and a moment between mother 

and son as they attempt to recall 

an old prayer from memory.

In its less direct moments, 

“Those Who Come, Will Hear” 

probes the connection between 

land 
and 
livelihood. 
Plouffe 

occasionally abstracts shots of 

nature, distorting the image and 

overlaying ambient sounds and 

monologues 
from 
indigenous 

speakers, who are never named 

individually. 
Instead, 
Plouffe 

focuses on the pure sound of the 

languages, on the intonation and 

pitch. As a result, it seems as if the 

land is speaking for all the voices 

that have been silenced in the 

past.

Despite its focus on a large-

scale social problem, “Those 

Who Come, Will Hear” never 

attempts to proselytize to its 

audience. 
Plouffe 
does 
not 

introduce 
anything 
garish 

or 
confrontational: 
statistics, 

interviews with the government or 

any outsiders to the communities 

he 
visits. 
He 
suggests 
that 

these places are self-sufficient 

and unique, which colonialism 

has always challenged. While 

there are similarities that have 

emerged between the cultures of 

indigenous people and Europeans

after years of cultural exchange, 

Plouffe does not whitewash his 

subjects. At one point, a father 

and son discuss the naming 

conventions of tails while the 

father examines the carcass of an 

otter at the dinner table. 

The beauty and honesty of 

“Those Who Come, Will Hear” is 

so beguiling that it becomes easy 

to forget the sadness and tension 

that underpins the speakers’ 

situation. 
Instead, 
Plouffe 

provides a view from the inside 

out. For these speakers, there is 

no use in brooding over the past. 

Resilience and preservation are 

not options — they’re promises.
