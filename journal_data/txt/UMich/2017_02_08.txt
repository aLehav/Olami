Tuesday 
night, 
at 
least 

three racist emails were sent 
out to University of Michigan 
Computer 
Science 
and 

Engineering 
undergraduate 

students.

The subjects of the first 

two 
emails 
was 
“African 

American Student Diversity” 
and the third read “Jewish 
Student Diversity.”

The first two emails read: 

“Hi n*****s, I just wanted to 
say that I plan to kill all of you. 
White power! The KKK has 
returned!!! Heil Trump!!!!”

The third reads: “Hi you 

fucking filthy jews, I just 
wanted to say the SS will rise 
again and kill all of your filthy 
souls. Die in a pit of eternal 
fire! 
Sincerely, 
Dr. 
Alex 

Halderman.”

The emails were sent by 

three 
separate 
University 

uniqnames — all of which 
are 
administrators 
of 

the 
listservs, 
potentially 

indicative the listservs via the 
University’s online contact 
server, 
MCommunity, 
may 

have been hacked. 

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald could not provide 
further 
information, 
but 

confirmed the University had 
been apprised of the situation. 

Kathryn Edin and Luke 

Shaefer presented their book 
“$2.00 a Day: Living on Almost 
Nothing in America” — which 
won the 2016 Hillman Prize 
for Book Journalism and made 
The New York Times’ list of 
“100 Notable Books of 2015” — 
to approximately 600 visitors 
Tuesday night at Rackham 
Auditorium, followed by a 
book signing.

Edin, a professor at the 

Bloomberg School of Public 
Health, has been conducting 
research in American poverty 
for 
more 
than 
20 
years. 

Shaefer is a professor of social 
work at the University of 
Michigan and director of the 
Poverty Solutions initiative, 
which seeks strategies to 
prevent and alleviate poverty.

The book tells stories of 

real people who live on $2 
per day, depicting their poor 
living 
conditions. 
Shaefer 

described the book revealing 
the effects of changing public 
policy on families, looking 
specifically to low-wage work 
and affordable housing.

According to Shaefer, the 

most 
meaningful 
part 
of 

writing the book was the 
opportunity to meet people 
and go places he had never 
seen before. He pointed out 
how stratified and separated 
today’s society is.

“In many ways, we are 

disconnected, 
those 
with 

means and those without,” 
Shaefer said. “It is almost like 
we are living parallel lives. 
We are in the same places, but 
never in the same spaces.”

Currently the authors are 

working 
with 
filmmaker 

Jennifer Redfearn to turn 
the book into a documentary. 
They showed her the places 
they had visited themselves 
while working in the field. 

“This has been such a 

remarkable 
experience 

because 
we 
have 
just 

happened in on situation after 
situation that just amplify the 
themes of ‘$2 a day,’ ” Edin 
said.

The authors also spoke 

during the event about the 
story of a woman they only 

Councilmember Julie Grand 

(D–Ward 3) expressed her 
desire to clarify the city’s 
Tobacco 21 ordinance is still 
in effect Monday at a City 
Council meeting, despite an 
opinionissued 
by 
Michigan 

Attorney General Bill Schuette 
claiming the ordinance is in 
conflict with state law.

The 
ordinance, 
which 

was passed Aug. 4 and went 
into effect Jan. 1, raises the 
minimum 
age 
for 
tobacco 

purchase from 18 to 21.

“It’s been widely reported 

that an opinion issued by the 
attorney general last week has 
invalidated our Tobacco 21 
ordinance, and that is simply 
false,” Grand said. “While the 
attorney 
general’s 
opinion 

does have implications for the 
actions of those who work for 
state agencies, he does not 
have the power or authority 
to 
invalidate 
our 
local 

ordinances.”

Schuette’s opinion is not the 

only opposition the ordinance 
has faced –– the ordinance

Spiritual leaders speak about theology, philosophical context of religion at Hill Auditorium

What does it mean to be 

human? 
More 
than 
3,500 

students 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 

residents filled Hill Auditorium 
on Tuesday night to grapple with 
this very question and listen to 

Christian apologist writers Ravi 
Zacharias and Abdu Murray 
discuss 
questions 
of 
value, 

morality and human worth in 
the context of a Christian faith.

Christian apologetics is a 

branch of Christian theology 
that uses historical evidence, 
philosophical 
reasoning, 
as 

well of other forms of academic 

inquiry to defend the religion 
against criticism. One of the 
speakers, 
Zacharias, 
is 
the 

founder of the Ravi Zacharias 
International Ministries based 
in Toronto, which promotes 
this school of thought. Murray 
serves as the North American 
director of these ministries.

Sponsored 
by 
Christian 

student organization Michigan 
Cru, the event was centered on 
the idea that humans are not 
collections of random atoms, 
but replete with intrinsic worth 
provided by God. The presenters 
believe in the modern loss of 
self-worth, and how humans 
derive their value from others,

a 

resolution aiming to host an

to 

foster dialogue passed with 18 
in favor, nine opposed and five

assembly debated heatedly over 
the details of the resolution and 
CSG’s handling of the debate, with 
LSA Representative Eli Schrayer 
voting “no with rights” against 
his own resolution to continue the 
conversation.

The resolution was in response 

to CSG’s previous meeting that 
involved Palestinian and Israeli

Grateful for those in Confress 
who DID try to keep DeVos 
out. And even more grateful 
for the teachers in my life who 
deserve better. 

Though it won’t a come 

as a surprise to many, a 

new University of Michigan 

publicationfound most people 

pass waiting time by using their 

cell phones.

The study, released Monday 

afternoon, is co-authored by 

Daniel Kruger, a research 

assistant professor at the 

University. Kruger’s study — 

conducted in restaurants and 

lobbies across Ann Arbor — 

found that 62 percent of people 

waiting for a beverage or food, at 

a bus stop, or in a waiting room 

used their cell phones to pass the 

time, with 55 percent of people 

began using their phone in less 

than 10 seconds.

“Some of our questions 

include, ‘How does usage of 

cell phones relate to people’s 

interactions in real-life social 

space?’ “ Kruger told Michigan 

News. “The best way to answer 

certain kinds of questions may be 

through observational methods.”

By using information from 

the service providers, Kruger 

found college students are on 

their phones up to five hours 

every day, but also paid attention 

to the social contexts in which 

students use their phones.

“The accuracy of self-

reported cell phone usage rates 

has been called into question 

as it only moderately correlated 

with objective server log data,” 

the study reads.

According to the Michigan 

News release, Kruger envisions 

his findings as part of a bigger 

picture issue of the effects of cell 

phone use on social interactions.

“If everyone is stuck to their 

screens, they’re not going to be 

interacting with other people 

around them,” Kruger said. “Are 

people going to be losing their 

social skills because they just 

don’t interact with other people, 

especially strangers? It has 

very real implications for social 

cohesion and social capital at a 

larger societal level, if people 

just aren’t talking to each other.”

Mila Versteeg, Law Professor at the University of Virginia, discusses the impact of consti-
tutional rights at the School of Social Work on Tuesday. 

L AW LECTURE

The death of a loved one, 

the grief of never being able 
to see a loved one’s corpse and 
knowing their final wish was 
never granted were all topics 
discussed in the panel “Six 
Feet Over, Six Feet Under” 
Tuesday 
evening 
in 
the 

Michigan Union.

The panel featured experts 

on the laws and measures 
surrounding 
death 
and 

palliative care — health care 
directed at making the lives 
of individuals with a terminal 
illness feel more comfortable.

The 
experts 
dispelled 

misconceptions 
surrounding 

hospice and discussed the 
importance 
of 
advance 

directives — legal documents 
specifying actions to be taken 

on an individual when they 
can no longer make decisions.

Attorney Rebecca Wrock 

mentioned that putting off 
advance 
directives 
creates 

many consequences after the 
death has occurred. If students 
die and their parents have 
not taken the proper advance 
directives, the parents might 
not be allowed to see their 
children 
before 
days 
of 

government intervention.

Merilynne 
Rush, 
a 

registered nurse, invoked the 
Sandy Hook tragedy as a prime 
example of how not attending 
to advance directives can be 
devastating to a family.

“This is what the families 

of the Sandy Hook Elementary 
School victims had to face,” 
Rush 
said. 
“The 
parents 

couldn’t see their children 
until 
their 
bodies 
were 

forensically examined by the 
government.”

Rush also discussed hospice 

and 
its 
role 
in 
palliative 

care. Rush said a common 
misconception is that hospice 
is like giving up on life, but 
it is really about making the 
last years of a people’s lives 
more comfortable and even 
extending their lives.

The panel also discussed 

how, while it is clear not 

preparing for such situations 
could bode consequences for 
families, many people still 
avoid them because of their 
lack of acknowledgement of 
death.

Wrock 
said 
the 
topic 

of 
death 
makes 
people 

uncomfortable, 
leading 

them to avoid talking about 
it. She added that most of 
the 
logistics 
surrounding 

death and its aftermath are 
unknown to the public.

Business 
junior 
Greg 

Graham 
mentioned 
how 

important it is for students 
to have this knowledge as 
it greatly affects them and 
their families.

“It affects all of us and 

our families and there are 
certainly a lot of people 
in our college who have 
grandparents 
who 
are 

starting 
to 
go 
through 

medical 
issues,” 
Graham 

said. “It would definitely 
be helpful for students and 
their families to have this 
sort of knowledge.”

“We are aware of an email 

such as the one you describe 
and our IT security team is 
looking into it,” he said. “I’m 
not even sure what names are 
that may be associated, but 
clearly that’s one of the first 
things they’ll be looking at, is 
whether 
someone’s 
account 

has been compromised.”

The uniqname of J. Alex 

Halderman, 
a 
professor 

of 
computer 
science 
and 

engineering, 
was 
used 
in 

the original emails sent out. 
His name was also signed at 
the bottom of the third anti-
Semitic 
email. 
Halderman 

acknowledged the incidents in 
an email statement to the Daily 
early Wednesday morning.

“This evening many EECS 

undergrads received emails 
with racist and antisemitic 
content that appeared to be 
addressed from me or from my 
Ph.D. student Matt Bernhard,” 
Halderman 
wrote. 
“These 

messages were spoofed. Matt 
and I did not send them, and 
we don’t know who did. As I 
teach in my computer security 
classes, it takes very little 
technical 
sophistication 
to 

forge the sender’s address in 

an email.”

Halderman also addressed 

this incident as in response 
to his position as an election 
security expert.

“This 
appears 
to 
be 
a 

cowardly action by someone 
who is unhappy about the 
research that Matt and I do in 
support of electoral integrity,” 

Halderman wrote. “We study 
cybersecurity and elections, 
and in recent months we were 
involved in efforts to recount 
the presidential election to 
confirm 
that 
the 
outcome 

hadn’t been changed by a 
cyberattack. I wrote about why 
these efforts were necessary 
shortly after the election. In 
any case, the content of these 
emails is contemptible, and I’m 
sorry that the EECS student 
body was subjected to them. 
The university is aware of 
the situation, and I expect an 

official response soon.”

The University Division of 

Public Safety and Security 
also tweeted a message stating 
actions are being taken in 
an 
investigation 
of 
these 

incidents. 

In response to the emails, 

a post was made in the public 
Computer Science Facebook 
group 
for 
the 
University. 

Comments 
on 
the 
post 

speculated as to how and why 
the messages were sent.

“The uniqname is probably 

being faked to a moderator/
owner on the group so the 
email will bypass moderation,” 
one comment reads. “The name 
is being set to the victim’s name 
along with reply-to field so he 
receives the complaint.”

Engineering 
junior 
Noah 

Martin-Ruben wrote in an 
email interview he would not 
speculate the named senders 
are at fault. 

“It looks like the person 

sending the emails is trying to 
anonymize themselves by using 
a fake, somewhat untraceable 
email,” Martin-Ruben wrote.

On 
the 
same 
Facebook 

page, it was speculated that 
the emails did not come from 
the senders they appeared to. 
Instead, posters believed the 
messages were routed from a 
fake emkei.cz email.

EMAILS
From Page 1A

rather than from Christianity. 

Murray 
discussed 
the 

importance of the “Golden 
Rule,” the concept that rather 
than treating others kindly 
because of a selfish desire 
for 
reciprocal 
kindness, 

humans 
should 
empathize 

with all humans and foster 
relationships bound by love.

“I want to leave you with 

that,” he said. “Because if we 
take in that message, and live 
as somebody else, regardless 
of 
their 
beliefs, 
regardless 

of their creeds, regardless of 
their backgrounds, regardless 
of their ethnicities, if we can 
take in that message and live 
like that, then maybe our 
correct idea of what it means 
to be human will ultimately be 
restored.”

Murray 
also 
believes 

relationships are failing due 
to humans passing judgement 
onto 
others 
rather 
than 

deriving intrinsic worth from 
God.

“Our sense of connectedness 

is cracked,” Murray said. “If our 
connection to God is cracked, 
our connection to each other is 
cracked.”

Zacharias expanded upon 

Murray’s 
idea 
of 
intrinsic 

worth 
by 
explaining 
how 

relationships are what help 
make human beings unique, 
despite being made in the 
image of God.

“How God manages this 

is absolutely remarkable, by 
introducing the notion of the 
family and love between the 
fellow human being,” Zacharias 
said. “While you and I share 

the image of God, you have a 
distinctive uniqueness where 
your relationships give you the 
privilege of a kind of love that 
they cannot give to anybody 
else. You are in a relationship 
with that privilege to God.”

Zacharias 
said 
citizens 

put too much value in their 
governments rather than in 
their own self-worth.

“Some 
nations 
actually 

believe that the value of an 
individual is made by those in 
power,” he said. “That’s not 
what the Bible reminds you and 
me; it reminds us that you are 
made with such essential worth 
and intrinsic worth.”

Zacharias ended the event 

with his disappointment in 
the amount of social division 
in 
the 
modern 
world. 
He 

questioned what civil rights 
activist Martin Luther King 
Jr. would think of the hatred 
being spewed — believing that 
the words of intolerance send 
a terrible message to today’s 
youth.

“What has happened to us 

now?” Zacharias said. “If we 
can’t even talk to each other 
in a civil way, we are sending 
a horrible example to our 
young — to say that unless you 
think like me, I’m going to be 
intolerant of you.”

Regardless of their religious 

views, students in attendance 
shared the opinion that the 
speakers presented interesting 
points and thought-provoking 
ideas.

LSA sophomore Mary Kate 

McNamara said she appreciated 
how the talk allowed people of 
many different worldviews to 
come together and discuss a 
topic relevant to all humans.

“I really liked the Q&A at 

the 
end,” 
McNamara 
said. 

“I found it very interesting 
and refreshing that people 
with 
such 
different 
world 

perspectives, whether they are 
Christian, of another religion 
or non-religious, could discuss 
a topic as important as human 
worth and dignity with such 
respect for one another.”

LSA senior Erin Finn said 

she was excited to take part in 
a forum where the Christian 
perspective on the purpose 
of life was illuminated, as too 
many people view Christianity 
as a strict set of rules rather 
than guiding purpose of life.

She explained that message 

of the speakers and how they 
voiced her beliefs accurately 
to a large group of people, 
resonated within her. 

“Ravi 
and 
Abdu 
really 

touched on how Christianity 
is about an ultimate gift of love 
from God, and how God’s love 
for us gives our life purpose,” 
Finn said. “They noted how 
this his necessitates nothing 
from us, but rather arises from 
our intrinsic worth as human 
beings made in God’s image. 
As a Christian, I was really 
happy that other people could 
hear what I actually believe, 
not what they might think I 
believe.”

passed with two dissenting 
votes, from Councilmember 
Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4) and 
Councilmember Jane Lumm 
(I–Ward 2).

“I am vividly aware of the 

cost of smoking, but I can’t 
support this ordinance,” Eaton 
said in a July City Council 
meeting. 
“The 
Michigan 

Tobacco Products Tax Act 
says that we shall not impose 
any 
new 
requirements 
or 

prohibitions 
pertaining 
to 

the sale of tobacco, and that’s 
exactly what we’re doing here. 
I think that when there’s a 
state law that tells us not to do 
something, we’re ill-advised 
to do it regardless of how 
passionate we are about the 
intent behind the law.”

The opinion, also issued 

Monday, was requested by 
state Sen. Rick Jones (R–Grand 
Ledge). In it, Schuette argues 
state law preempts local laws 
in this case, and that it is 
specifically in conflict with 
the state’s Age of Majority Act.

“The Act expressly bars 

laws that prescribe duties, 
liabilities, 
responsibilities, 

rights and legal capacity of 
persons who are 18 to 20 years 
old that are ‘different’ from 
those who are 21 years old,” 
Schuette wrote. “The Age of 

Majority Act’s rejection of a 
difference of laws for those 
between the ages of 18 to 20 
years as a class from those 21 
years and older was predicated 
on the existence of a duty, 
liability, responsibility, right, 
or legal capacity related to the 
sale or furnishing of tobacco 
products.”

Though the minimum age of 

21 for the purchase of alcohol 
in the state appears in conflict 
with this act, the Michigan 
Court of Appeals ruled in 1984 
that the general provisions in 
the Age of Majority Act “did not 
alter” the Liquor Control Act 
passed by the state legislature, 
which raised the minimum age 
for purchase from 18 to 21.

Noting 
that 
Schuette’s 

opinion did not have legal 
weight, Grand implied the 
opinion also might be factually 
incorrect.

“Not being an attorney, I 

won’t comment much on the 
legal merits of the opinion, 
except that I would like to point 
out that the attorney general 
has been wrong before,” she 
said.

Furthermore, 
Grand 

questioned 
the 
motives 
of 

Attorney 
General 
Schuette 

in issuing the opinion, saying 
it was a failure of his duty to 
protect the health of Michigan 
residents, and making her own 
motives clear.

“We have a couple public 

officials who are supposed to 
defend the health of Michigan 
citizens,” she said, referring 
to Schuette and Jones. “Why 
would they have the audacity 
to make it easier for our youth 
to have access to tobacco 
products?”

Grand referenced a study, 

published in March 2015 by the 
Institute of Medicine, which 
concluded that Tobacco 21 
ordinances would achieve their 
intended effect of preventing 
adolescents from taking up 
smoking in the first place.

“The committee concludes 

that overall, increasing the 
(minimum age of legal access) 
for tobacco products will likely 
prevent or delay initiation of 
tobacco use by adolescents and 
young adults,” the study reads. 
“The age group most impacted 
will be those age 15 to 17 years.”

In addition to adolescents 

who have access to tobacco 
through 
older 
friends 
or 

siblings, the ordinance also 
targets 
18-to-20-year-olds 

who may be on the path to 
addiction, Grand said.

Though the ordinance does 

not provide any resources 
for people under 21 who are 
already addicted, Washtenaw 
County and the University of 
Michigan both run tobacco 
cessation programs to assist 
residents 
and 
students 

struggling 
with 
tobacco 

addiction.

recently met during the filming 
process.

The woman, whose name 

was not given, was waiting 
for a local food pantry to be 
opened with two other men, as 
she had not eaten in four days, 
only to be turned down by the 
food bank for not having a 
mailing address.

Toward the end of the event, 

the authors stressed the need 
for action to be taken.

“Whatever those things are 

that we do, it is maybe not so 
much what you do, as how you 
do it,” Shaefer said. 

Shannon 
Powers, 
a 

University 
alum 
who 
now 

works at the Chelsea District 
Library, 
initially 
read 
the 

book as part of the Washtenaw 
Reads Planning Committee.

“It was so informative, but 

in a great way,” Powers said. 
“It was very narrative … so you 

were able to raise awareness 
and reach a larger audience as 
it was accessible to the average 
person.”

Kathy Daly, an Ann Arbor 

resident, said she appreciates 
how the book is so far-
reaching, and added that she 
finds it groundbreaking.

“It’s sort of low-key as 

it recounts stories of how 
people are trying to survive,” 
Daly said. “At the same time, 
because it is low-key, it is 
infinitely profound.”

If we can’t even 
talk to each other 

in a civil way, 

we are sending a 
horrible example

yet, with 34 against and 13 in favor.

Schrayer said the lunches would 

not be open to the public nor to 
students in general, but to only a 
select group.

“We can very easily get this 

funding from other places, but we 
think it’s a really good thing for 
CSG to pass,” Schrayer said.

CSG President David Schafer, 

an LSA senior, was opposed to 
the idea, as he believes that it’s not 
within CSG’s jurisdiction to fund 
resolutions of that nature.

“Quite simply, it’s not CSG’s 

place to judicate on international 
conflicts and international issues,” 
Schafer said. “Our scope is narrow, 
our priority, first and foremost, 
is to address pressing campus 
issues, and how students on this 
campus feel. I’ll be very honest, 
when people come up to me and 
say, ‘David, why is CSG considering 
(Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions), it 

has no place in CSG’ — I believe that 
BDS is far more relevant to CSG 
than this resolution, because BDS 
more directly impacts students 
on this campus. This is judicating 
on a conflict that ostensibly has 
no effects on the students on this 
campus directly.”

Schrayer disagreed, believing 

CSG is the right avenue to address 
campus climate. He said if Jewish 
student 
organization 
Hillel 

sponsored the event, it would look 
too biased.

“I think this is 100 percent a 

student government issue because 
it’s campus climate, it’s how 
students on campus are dealing 
with 
one 
another 
and 
their 

everyday lives on campus; people 
feel this every single day,” Schrayer 
argued. “If not here, then where 
is the place? This is why I ran 
for student government, to bring 
issues that affect my community 
here. We’re simply buying food for 
people to come together and I don’t 
see a downside to that.”

Rackham student Rep. Andy 

Snow expressed that the amount 
requested wasn’t outside of the 
CSG budget’s means, and stated 
that the resolution was showing 
initiative in trying to improve 
campus climate.

“This is 200 bucks, and we have 

approximately $20,000 — that’s 
0.01 percent of the money we have 
for the next month,” Snow said. 
“I don’t think it’s going to work 
at all, but I see no reason why it’s 
not worth trying when they’re the 
only people who have tried to do 
something through here. I find 
the pushback on this absolutely 
ridiculous.”

Schafer responded to Snow, 

emphasizing that BDS has had little 
consistent change when presented 
to the body and that his opposition 
to the resolution was not because of 
its financial aspects.

“We’ve given BDS the same 

chance that we’ve given this 
resolution, and every year BDS has 
failed, OK?” Schafer said.

While 
the 
University 
is 

spending 
significant 
time 

and energy in the interests of 
diversity, equity and inclusion, 
the inclusion of those with 
disabilities has been ignored 
by almost all University plans 
outside of Union renovations. The 
University-wide plan uses vague 
language to refer to the need 
for inclusive design with only a 
single specific University-wide 
initiative to evaluate University 
web 
tools 
as 
screen-reader 

capable. While these initiatives 
are certainly laudable, we would 
have expected more thought to 
have gone into this significant 
issue across the University.

In general, the overarching DEI 

plan includes little concerning 
the inclusivity of people with 
disabilities. While the University-
wide plan includes headshots 
of many diverse members of 
our community, the plan lacks a 
photo of a visibly disabled person 
on its front page, excluding those 
who identify as disabled from the 
get-go. It sometimes even uses 
language considered derogatory 
by people in the disabilities 
community; the one quote from a 
visibly physically disabled woman 
in the entire plan includes the 
term “handicap,” which many in 
the disabled community consider 
extremely derogatory.

Moreover, 
LSA 
and 
the 

Division of Student Life, two 
of the largest units that deal 
directly 
with 
students, 
lack 

concrete efforts in their DEI 
plans to appeal to students 
with disabilities. While this 
board has previously identified 
significant issues with the DEI 
initiatives, co-opting the disabled 
experience in these plans while 
weakly dealing with the problems 
is unacceptable.

These oversights manifest in 

the infrastructure of our campus, 
as 
students 
with 
physical 

disabilities 
have 
identified 

seemingly simple issues that 
have just been ignored by the 
University. Perhaps the largest 
issue is that buildings that 
comply with Americans with 
Disabilities Act regulations do 
not ensure that people with 
disabilities feel included in those 
spaces. While ADA-compliant 
buildings may include accessible 
pieces of infrastructure such 
as ramps or wide hallways, 
these 
implementations 
often 

segregate students with physical 
disabilities, who consequently 
must use alternate back or side 
entrances and roundabout routes 
to get to their destinations.

Beyond 
entrances, 
many 

lecture 
halls 
have 
accessible 

seating only in the back, making 
it difficult for students to see, 
hear or participate, especially in a 
large room. Some of these design 
oversights even endanger students 

with disabilities. For example, 
a significant number of West 
Quad’s “accessible” rooms are 
located on the fifth floor, creating 
potentially 
life-threatening 

danger for students with physical 
disabilities in the event of a fire or 
other emergency restricting use 
of the elevator. These design flaws 
send the message that students 
with physical disabilities are not 
wanted — or even safe — in our 
main spaces.

In order to craft more inclusive 

building and service plans, it is 
crucial the University consults with 
several students with disabilities, 
as each student has different 
experiences 
and 
personalized 

needs and can provide a nuanced 
understanding of what it means 
to be a student with a disability 
on campus. For many able-bodied 
individuals, it is impossible to truly 
understand and think about all 
the obstacles a disabled individual 
might 
encounter 
on 
a 
daily 

basis. As a result, non-disabled 
administrators are unable to devise 
effective policies or solutions 
without taking the time to listen 
to 
students 
with 
disabilities. 

This inexperience can also lead 
non-disabled 
administrators 
to 

make assumptions on behalf of 
disabled individuals, and these 
administrators 
are 
usually 

uninformed 
and 
openly 
work 

against fully including disabled 
students when crafting policies that 
have everything to do with them.

As of May 2016, the University 

serves the most students with 
disabilities in all of the Big Ten. 
According to the SSD’s 2015-2016 
annual report, 2,277 students 
— 
including 
undergraduate, 

graduate 
and 
professional 

students 
— 
are 
registered 

with the office. Despite the 
numbers, the University has 
a 
disappointing 
number 
of 

specialist faculty members to 
help disabled students access 
equal opportunities on campus. 
The Services for Students with 
Disabilities office provides a 
variety of assistance options for 
students with learning, mental 
and physical disabilities. Over 
the past six years there has 
been a surge in SSD student 
enrollment, but the SSD budget 
has been nearly cut in half. There 
must be an increase in funding to 
SSD to ensure all students with 
disabilities can get individual 
help for their specific needs. 
An increase in funding would 
also allow the SSD to reach its 
full outreach potential, as many 
students are not aware of the 
services that SSD can provide.

Finally, the University needs 

to tackle disability culture as a 
whole, ensuring all students feel 
safe and welcome on campus. 
While this task is a tall order, as 
it likely involves restructuring 
curriculum 
and 
course 

requirements, it is a desperately 
needed step in protecting all 
students. There are currently 
many issues surrounding ableist 
culture that go unnoticed on 
campus. Those who are able-
bodied are often not required 
to think in a way that includes 
perspectives 
of 
those 
with 

disabilities. 
Few 
classes 
are 

taught with units on disabilities 
and even fewer classes dive 
into the heart of curriculum on 
disabilities and disability history.

For example, while it may 

seem important to have a class 
dedicated to the implementation 
of 
accessible 
buildings 
for 

students studying architecture 
or civil engineering, such classes 
are only offered as electives 
to 
architecture 
students. 

Furthermore, 
while 
it 
may 

seem that those in LSA would 
greatly benefit from classes on 
disabilities, it is not a requirement 
that this information be taught 
and it is only discussed in a few 
classes, often through the Race 
and Ethnicity requirement. A few 
student groups, like Initiative for 
Inclusive Design, are working 
toward shedding light on issues 
of ableism on campus. But with 
ableism being such a problematic 
cultural norm, the University has 
a duty to educate its students on 
the struggles this marginalized 
population continues to face, 
especially when we as a campus 
have a goal to enhance our 
diversity, equity and inclusion.

Such a culture shift will likely 

take a long time to implement and 
take effect on campus, but this 
effort needs to start now. There is 
no excuse for largely ignoring an 
entire group of people on campus 
and throughout the world, and 
denying their voices and stories 
from being heard. The University 
should spearhead a culture shift 
against ableism by recognizing 
disability as an identity essential 
to 
diversity, 
working 
with 

students 
with 
disabilities 
to 

rectify those issues and educating 
others 
on 
the 
history 
and 

current culture on disabilities. 
Most important to this culture 
shift will be continuing the 
conversation 
and 
openly 

discussing where we as a campus 
fall short and can improve. The 
DEI initiative has committed the 
University to supporting minority 
groups on campus. Furthermore, 
the University has displayed a 
commitment to protecting the 
rights of minority groups through 
actions such as the defense 
against racist fliers found around 
campus and President Donald 
Trump’s unacceptable executive 
order 
barring 
immigration 

from 
seven 
Muslim-majority 

countries. Thus, it is imperative 
that the University also works to 
defend the rights of students with 
disabilities on campus.

W

hen we think about 
Valentine’s 
Day, 

we tend to picture 

a perfect romantic night — a 
bouquet of red roses, 
dinner 
at 
a 
fine-

dining restaurant and 
the best selection of 
wine. And, of course, 
this 
perfect 
night 

doesn’t come without 
a price tag. According 
to 
the 
Journal 
of 

Business 
Research 

study conducted by 
Krugman and Grannis, 
U.S. shoppers spend $13.7 million 
dollars on this day. Valentine’s 
Day is an opportunity to shower 
your partner with love and 
affection. That’s one argument.

Valentine’s 
Day 
doesn’t 

always pan out the way we 
want. Amandalea71 expresses 
her disappointment on Reddit 
that her boyfriend took her to 
“the grimiest IHOP in town 
and then go see Avatar for the 
4th time.” To some, Valentine’s 
Day is simultaneously the best 
and worst day of their life, 
as JENbubbie writes: “I was 
married 2/14/87. I was served 
divorce papers 2/14/2010.”

These Valentine’s Day horror 

stories makes us consider: Is 
Valentine’s Day really about 
love? Despite the promised day 
of celebration, it seems that 
many people are left unsatisfied 
and worse yet, alone. I find 
that the obligatory nature of 
this holiday is the culprit of an 
unsatisfactory outcome.

The problem with Valentine’s 

Day is not that people spend 
money, but that we feel like we 
have to. Close and Zinkhan find 
that 63 percent of men and 31 
percent of women feel obligated 
to give a gift to their partner 

for Valentine’s Day. As a case in 
point, I gave my seventh-grade 
Valentine 
a 
Giant 
Hershey’s 

Kiss with a rolled up 20-dollar 

bill. I thought that 
chocolate 
was 
not 

expensive enough and 
cash would do justice 
(Remember: 20 dollars 
is a lot of money to a 
seventh-grader). 

According 
to 

researchers 
at 
the 

University of Rhode 
Island, 
this 
forced 

consumerism 
can 

lead to reactance: When people’s 
freedom of choice is threatened, 
like when they feel forced to 
spend money on gifts, they 
tend to aggressively want the 
alternative, like not wanting to 
buy the gift.

As a result, people tend to 

engage in the gift-exchange in 
an insincere manner. From a 
consumer research survey, some 
of the reasons cited by consumers 
for partaking in gift giving 
on Valentine’s Day included: 
“Because your significant other 
will get pissed off if you don’t” 
and “Because if I didn’t, I would 
never hear the end of it.”

To make matters worse, the 

problem lies on both ends of this 
gift exchange. A FierceRetail 
report reveals that while we 
expect our significant other 
to spend about $240 on us, 
men will spend about $98 and 
women will spend about $71. 
This 
discrepancy 
between 

expectations 
and 
reality 

leaves 
many 
gift 
receivers 

disappointed and unsatisfied.

On 
this 
account, 
Peter 

McGraw and his colleagues 
find that we have a tendency to 
quantify love. Individuals will 
spend more money on a gift for 

a loved one even if a cheaper 
option is available. Therefore, 
receiving a more expensive gift 
would imply that their partner 
loves them on a greater scale. 
Conversely, then, those who 
receive a gift of low price value 
would think that their partners 
love them less.

Due 
to 
these 
heightened 

expectations surrounding this 
holiday, we fail to appreciate 
the gift-giving gestures in full 
account and we demand more. 
According 
to 
Time’s 
survey, 

70 percent of people want to 
be surprised with gifts rather 
than be asked what they want 
for Valentine’s Day or know in 
advance. However, we still find 
that many people choose to spend 
the money rather than planning a 
more thoughtful surprise.

Considering 
the 
unmet 

expectations 
of 
Valentine’s 

Day, it is surprising to find that 
about half of millennials still 
plan to splurge this year with an 
even greater amount of money 
than previous generations from 
FierceRetail statistics.

Don’t 
feel 
like 
spending 

the big bucks? The G Brief 
reminds us that the other half 
of millennials find Valentine’s 
Day to be overrated and one-
third of them don’t plan to 
participate. I am also jumping 
on this bandwagon.

I tend to feel sympathetic 

toward Valentine’s Day doers 
as I used to be one of them. 
However, I realize that red 
roses, fancy gourmet chocolates 
and teddy bears that say “I love 
you” — and certainly expecting 
to be spent $240 on — don’t 
define true love and romance.

4A — Wednesday, February 8, 2017

P

resident Donald Trump’s 
executive ban on visas 
from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, 

Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen 
was 
recently 
suspended 
by 

a federal judge, which is in 
effect nationwide — though it 
is currently being appealed. As 
the ban comes to a standstill, 
uncertainty about the treatment 
of immigrants, Muslims and 
green-card holders by the United 
States still hangs in the air.

Though 
many 
Americans 

find the Trump administration’s 
actions shocking, they are only a 
consequence of inaction. It is the 
failure of people to act sooner 
and to care for the injustices that 
previous 
administrations 
have 

done to these countries, as well as 
to its own citizens, that has gotten 
America to where it is today. Under 
the Obama administration, the 
seven countries that were put on 
this list previously had restricted 
visa rights, and five of these 
seven countries were bombed 
during 
his 
administration. 

His administration was also 
responsible 
for 
deporting 

more people than any previous 
president. Trump’s actions are 
not occurring in isolation, but 
only a continuation of policies 
that Americans did not openly 
oppose that have caused them to 
become the norms of society. The 
apathy toward the United States’ 
bombing of these countries as 
well as the normalization of 
profiling Muslims has created the 
foundations on which Trump’s 
actions are built upon. They are 
not unfounded, but instead only a 
continuation of previous policies 
put in place in the name of the war 
on terror — though this time, on a 
much larger scale. These policies 
only further the fear of others, as 
they did post 9/11, and the rate of 
hate crimes has only risen since.

The rhetoric behind Trump’s 

ban is for the safety of the 
country, but the countries where 
such terrorists have come from 
in the past — Saudi Arabia, the 
United Arab Emirates, Egypt 

and Qatar — are not on this list. 
Though many of those who 
voted for Trump thought that 
he would not be influenced by 
special interests, these countries 
are still allies to the current 
administration. And yet, even as 
people hold on to the idealism that 
the Clinton administration would 
have been bliss, the truth is that 
its foreign policy was still largely 
influenced by special interests, as 
the Clinton Foundation accepted 
tens of millions of dollars from 
these same countries. For the 
citizens of the six countries with 
a history of violent intervention 
on behalf of the United States, 
which administration destroys 
their homes has little relevance 
to them. The executive ban only 
brought the issue closer to the 
home and directly affected people 
in a more overt way. The ban 
was based on the fundamental 
misunderstanding 
that 
the 

citizens of these countries are 
to blame for the turmoil in 
their countries and equates the 
oppressed with their oppressors.

It is crucial that all people 

who seek to create real change 
ask themselves what it is that 
they seek to achieve and whether 
their activism is true or only self-
fulfilling. In the age of social 
media activism, people often sit 
behind their computer monitors 
and try to write the cleverest anti-
Trump rhetoric or pro-humanity 
slogan in 140 characters, without 
action to follow. Likewise, people 
may attend a protest and forget 
about the issue the next week 
because it is no longer in the news. 
Though social media activism 
and protesting can be powerful, 
it is crucial to be consistent and 
to show continued solidarity for 
there to be sustainable change.

Even if the ban is truly 

suspended, there are more issues 
in this country that have long been 
buried far below the attention 
of the public eye. The effects of 
social media activism and other 
forms of self-fulfilling activism 
are evident in the way issues are 
so easily forgotten, like the Flint 
Water Crisis, which is now rarely 
talked about in the public sphere, 

but it is nowhere near resolved. 
The House Oversight Committee 
recently closed the investigation of 
how much officials knew about the 
lead levels in Flint’s water, leaving 
Flint’s residents without answers 
for the causes of their suffering.

Likewise, though people have 

been rising to protest against 
the 
Trump 
administration’s 

decisions, there is still a lack of 
fair media attention to the Black 
Lives Matter movement. It is 
often the issues of those from 
lower 
socioeconomic 
status, 

people of color and victims of 
dehumanizing foreign policy that 
go overlooked and forgotten. Not 
only should people be concerned 
with the issues that are easily 
visible, but also those that go 
forgotten easily and that have 
been prevalent for years.

It is up to us to not forget them, 

not just when the issue affects us 
personally, but whenever we see 
acts of injustice, whether it be on 
Americans or on those affected by 
United States policy around the 
world. It is only with consistent 
reminders and tangible actions 
that these issues can be reversed, 
and 
long-standing 
systemic 

problems can be overturned. The 
world is at a crossroads in history, 
and which direction America will 
take is unknown.

And yet, in the short time that 

Donald Trump has been president 
of the United States, there has been 
a strong public solidarity among 
people in support of immigrants 
and Muslims that has never been 
seen previously on such a large 
scale. This should be used as an 
opportunity for people to unite 
and question policies that are 
created on the basis of fear, which 
stems 
from 
misunderstanding 

foreign countries. It also stems 
from a lack of public consciousness 
on the United States’ influences in 
these countries and the systematic 
racism that is so prevalent in the 
education, occupation and health 
systems. If these issues are truly 
eradicated, the changes will last 
far past Trump’s administration.

FROM THE DAILY

Don’t ignore disability

A

s the University of Michigan continually implements initiatives to create 
a more diverse, inclusive and equitable environment, one minority in 
particular has been neglected in the University’s discussions: students with 

disabilities. Given 19 percent of people in the United States identified as disabled in 
the 2010 census, it seems exceptionally remiss for the University to neglect the needs 
of such a large portion of our population. These issues are incredibly salient now, 
as the University is moving forward with $85 million renovations to the Michigan 
Union, which include re-outfitting the building, which originally opened in 1919, to 
be more accessible for students with disabilities. While the University was ranked 
the most “disability friendly” campus in the United States in 2016, there is still a 
long way to go in confronting the ableist culture that pervades everyday aspects 
of life on campus. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board implores the University to 
heed the voices of students with disabilities in order to ensure that all students, 
regardless of their ability status, feel included on campus.

It’s up to us

Third Eye Blind’s debut 
record one to remember

Scorned by critics, fans make a point never to forget the

qualities that made the band worth a listen to begin with

Third Eye Blind is a band 

both immortal and scorned. 
Sure, 
they 
have 
scored 

more 
lasting, 

mainstream 
hits 
than 
any 

fledgling 
band 

today can even 
dream 
of, 
but 

their 
short 

window of success has forever 
confined them to the title of 
“ ’90s band.” You can almost 
imagine the deal with the 
devil that lead singer Stephan 
Jenkins made when he was 
unsigned in San Francisco: 
“Yeah, I’ll make you sextuple 
platinum, but you’ll end up as a 
consistent Justin Timberlake 
punchline.”

“The kid from ‘The Mickey 

Mouse 
Club?’ 
Seriously? 

Ah, fuck it, dude. Make me 
famous.”

And so Third Eye Blind 

still ends up confused with 
Semisonic, despite decidedly 
not being one-hit wonders. 
I’ll grant you that it’s not the 
greatest tragedy of our time, 
but still, Third Eye Blind’s 
self-titled debut is a first-
class overlooked album, and 
probably the best work to 
come out of the ’90s’ mostly 
forgettable “bubble grunge” 
phase. In the public eye, 
the hits shine so bright that 
people are blinded to the other 
songs, but 20 years later, Third 
Eye Blind remains a satisfying 
listen front to back.

The opening two tracks, 

“Losing a Whole Year” and 
“Narcolepsy,” 
aren’t 
the 

band’s 
most 
recognizable 

songs, but they provide a 
strong 
introduction 
to 
its 

songwriting 
abilities 
and 

style. “Losing a Whole Year” 
announces itself in attention-
grabbing fashion, with wall-
smashing power chords and a 
shouted refrain from Stephan 
Jenkins. Jenkins isn’t quite 
a rapper, but the verses here 
certainly bare some hip-hop 
influence — call it talk-singing 
with swagger.

“Narcolepsy,” 
meanwhile, 

showcases a kind of radio-
friendly pop rock that has 
fallen out of favor in the two 
decades 
since 
its 
release. 

Quietly 
strummed 
guitars 

and soft vocals eventually 
lead into a hard-charging yet 
inoffensive chorus. Third Eye 
Blind’s success likely stemmed 
in part from its ability to be 

both palatable to older fans 
of soft rock and yet retain 
the slightest of edges for the 
alternative crowd.

And after these first two 

songs, we get the stretch 
that made Third Eye Blind 
stars. “Semi-Charmed Life,” 

the 
record’s 

lead single and 
biggest hit, leads 
it off. It’s the 
boppiest 
song 

ever 
written 

about 
crystal 

meth, with a catchy little sing-
along hook and quickly rapped 
verses that are still extremely 
easy to keep up with. “Semi-
Charmed” remains, for good 
reason, the best-known and 
most-enjoyed Third Eye Blind 
song — it’s a crowd pleaser 
that still crosses genres in an 
innovative way and features 
some ambitious lyrical content 
hidden under its sweet sound.

“Jumper,” however, hasn’t 

aged quite as well. It’s a 
plodding acoustic song that 
never goes anywhere exciting. 
Its lyrical subject (a suicidal 
gay 
friend, 
according 
to 

Jenkins) has potential, but the 
words seem to purposely avoid 
any kind of specificity in favor 
of clichés. That said, nobody 
has forgotten the chorus in 
two decades, so it must be doing 
something right.

In the middle of this stretch 

one finds the somewhat lesser-
known “Graduate,” which was 
only a minor hit back in its day. 
However, 
its 
three 
minutes 

feature the most focused burst 
of energy on the whole album, 
and it’s the only heavy, fast 
track without any sort of quieter 
bridge. “Graduate” is the closest 
Third Eye Blind ever came to 
writing something Blink-182 
would.

And 
we 
close 
out 
this 

incredible 
run 
of 
tracks 

with “How’s It Going to Be.” 
Certainly the least immediate 
of the album’s hits, “How’s 
It 
Going 
to 
Be” 
might 

nevertheless 
be 
the 
most 

satisfying; it’s a perfect change 
of pace that builds to an 
unforgettable climax. When 
Jenkins gets to his barely 
comprehensible screaming at 
the end, it truly feels cathartic 
and earned. I’m not sure you 
can be more dynamic in a 
four-minute pop song.

I don’t necessarily blame 

anyone who turns off the 
record after “How’s It Going 
to Be.” Late ’90s records are 
notorious for their bloated 
runtimes, and Third Eye Blind 
is no exception, as the album’s 

second half is mostly taken 
up by filler tracks, inferior 
retreads of first-half songs 
and only a few memorable 
moments. Keep the breeziness 
of 
“Burning 
Man” 
and 

the 
well-crafted 
build 
of 

“Motorcycle Drive By,” and 
you can cut most of the rest.

That said, anyone giving 

this 
album 
another 
listen 

after some time away owes 
it to themselves to revisit 
“The 
Background.” 
Buried 

near the end of the album’s 
hour, it takes the romantic 
melancholy inherent in most 
of the record’s lyrics and 
gives it to the melody, too. We 
finally get some clear details 
from Jenkins in this break-up 
song (“I walk Haight Street 
to the store / And they say 
where’s that crazy girl / You 
don’t get drunk on red wine 
and fight no more”). There’s 
no distance here, no catchy 
“do do do”s to undersell a song 
about drugs. Jenkins isn’t an 
incredible singer, but on “The 
Background” he draws the 
listener into his heartbreak, 
fully immersing you into his 
world before tossing out a 
rewarding, invigorating heavy 
guitar solo.

I’ve been writing this piece 

taking it for granted that 
Third Eye Blind is no longer 
famous, but technically, that’s 
not exactly true. Sure, most 
people would be hard-pressed 
to name a song of theirs that 
has come out this millennium, 
but 
the 
band 
recently 

announced a 20th anniversary 
tour, set for the summer, that 
most currently buzzed-about 
bands could only dream of. 
While more presently relevant 
bands like Japandroids or The 
Hotelier play clubs or theaters 
(if they’re lucky), Third Eye 
Blind is still performing in 
amphitheaters with capacities 
in the high four figures, as 
the great songs of their past 
continue to be sung out by 
thousands every night.

So, more accurately, Third 

Eye Blind is a band scorned by 
charts and critics, but not fans. 
In the mainstream, they may be 
jokingly remembered, but within 
their own circle of admirers they 
remain stars — thanks mostly to 
this one twenty-year-old debut 
album. As their original fan base 
gets older and younger listeners 
hear them for the first time, this 
record seems to grow more and 
more in esteem. Frankly, I find 
their success inspiring: Write a 
few great, beloved songs, keep 
working, and you can live forever. 
No soul-selling required.

‘Safe in Sound’ deserves 
any praise sent its way

Long-time workers of the 

British music scene, Lower 
Than Atlantis have always 
seemed to be shunned by the 
spotlight 
that 

they 
deserve. 

Despite 
several 

prestigious 
festival 
spots 

in recent years, 
bands 
of 
the 

same class seem 
to keep getting 
placed ahead of 
them.

However, 
Lower 
Than 

Atlantis has consistently been 
putting out some of the best 
rock 
music, 
and 
although 

none of their albums have 
been 
commercial 
successes, 

their confidence and continual 
touring have kept them at 
the back of everyone’s mind. 
Now, with newfound maturity, 
Lower Than Atlantis seem 
to have finally hit the sweet 
spot of writing arena-worthy 
bangers on their new album 
Safe in Sound.

Four singles from the album 

were released in January — a 
move which usually harms 
the band — however “Had 
Enough,” “Boomerang,” “Work 
For It” and “Dumb” are perfect 

examples of what they can offer 
on this album. Each sounds 
different enough from the rest 
and most of their previously 
released music, enough so that 
they work as a teaser, not a 
spoiler. Lower Than Atlantis 
have always had a rough-
around-the-edges sound, but 

it’s 
now 
gone. 

Instead, 
the 

band 
sounds 

professional 
to 

the extreme — as 
you’d expect from 
a 
fifth 
album. 

Lead 
vocalist 

Mike 
Duce 

sounds his very 
best, the album 

showcasing 
the 
best 
vocal 

work he’s done to date, and 
even though some of the lyrics 
could be easily taken from any 
number of alt-rock bands, his 
delivery manages to save it 
from falling into cliché.

Although all of the songs are 

catchy, undoubtedly written 
to make a room full of people 
sing along, there seems to 
be a missing spark that was 
present in their previous work. 
“Another Sad Song,” from their 
2008 album World Record, is 
by far one of the best songs 
the band has written. It’s 
personal and bitter and angry 
all at the same time, and starts 
slow before building up into 
something shouted back at 

every live performance. There’s 
none of that personal emotion 
on Safe in Sound, and although 
the choruses are as catchy as 
you might hope, the personality 
of the band was lost.

Of course, if it was written to 

be a tidy, crowd pleasing album, 
Lower 
Than 
Atlantis 
have 

succeeded. There’s still enough 
to set this apart from the pack 
of other artists writing similar 
stadium alt-rock, and if you’ve 
never heard of LTA before, you 
owe it to yourself to give this a 
listen. It is focused, with sing-
along 
choruses 
everywhere 

you look, and the guitar riffs 
are just meaty enough to make 
this rock. Anyone new to the 
band will find a well-written 
rock album; long term fans, 
though, might just leave a little 
disappointed.

A soundtrack to life

As much as it is anything, “20th 

Century Women” is a catalogue of 
the artifacts that surround three 
distinct women in 1979. Among 
those artifacts — the jeans and the 
cameras and the cigarettes — is 
their music.

The film structures itself around 

this music, becoming 
itself a sort of playlist, 
and in the process 
assembling one of the 
best 
soundtracks 
of 

the year. It’s an audible 
time capsule of Santa 
Barbara in 1979.

The 
whole 

production is elevated 
by Roger Neill’s dreamy 
score, one of the most 
tragically 
overlooked 

of the year. Neill, who 
composed the score of 
Mills’s last film “Beginners” as well 
as Mike Birbiglia’s “Don’t Think 
Twice” and the Amazon series 
“Mozart in the Jungle,” crafts a 
score that both compliments and 
counteracts the punk, art pop and 
jazz that make up the rest of the 
soundtrack. The opening track — 
titled “Santa Barbara, 1979” for the 
text that appears onscreen — is 
synthy and soft, very Brian Eno and 
very un-punk.

On paper, or rather on a Spotify 

playlist, it’s pretty clear which 
songs “belong” to which character: 
Abbie is the Raincoats, Julie is the 
Talking Heads and Dorthea is Duke 
Ellington and Fred Astaire. But 
on screen the delineations are less 
clear. Each woman’s music invades 
the lives of the others — Dorthea 
goes to punk shows with Abbie and 
dances to The Talking Heads in a 
sincere attempt to understand the 
world her son is growing up in.

Mills understands how integral 

music is to defining a world, that 
music is one of the strongest world-
building tools filmmakers have, 
something unavailable in the same 
capacity to other storytellers. And 
thus he creates one of the most 
sharply real period-pieces of recent 
memory. It’s one thing to look like 

a 
certain 
moment 

in time, but to look 
and feel like it too is 
something else entirely.

In the movie, Jamie, 

the boy who consumes 
the music of the women 
around him — both 
their literal albums and 
the figurative music 
their lives make — is 
15. I turned 15 in the 
fall of 2011, and since 
seeing the film, I’ve 
been thinking about the 

soundtrack that would accompany 
my 15th year of life.

I was a freshman in High School, 

amped up on social anxiety and 
hope that the cute senior in my 
Spanish class would talk to me. In 
hindsight, I would love to be able 
to say I was listening to Watch the 
Throne and Section .80, but I wasn’t 
that cool yet.

I was emo without knowing I 

was. Sad, moody, lying on my bed 
listening to Bright Eyes wondering 
why the hell I was stuck living in 
the worst place on earth.

My soundtrack is not the kind of 

soundtrack conducive to fantastic 
dance sequences, although I can see 
Annette Benning and Billy Crudup 
trying to dance to Little Dragon’s 
“Ritual Union” before switching 
to M83’s “Midnight City” and 
absolutely losing it. 

It’s the sort of soundtrack that 

lends itself to car rides, areal shots 
of kids on bikes and skateboards, 

walking along the creek behind my 
childhood home, my mom teaching 
me how to drive. 

That was also the first year I 

started listening to my parent’s 
music, lured in by the sweet 
melancholy of Belle & Sebastian 
and LCD Soundsystem. I was also 
heavily influenced by the music 
my friends and my brother were 
listening to. There were two girls 
in my art class who paid attention 
to music, they would tell me 
about Beach House and took me 
to Black Keys concerts. My art 
teacher played David Bowie and 
had us watch the music video for 
Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used 
to Know.”

The music that surrounded me 

that year helps define it. It reminds 
me what it felt like to be 15. When I 
play that music for other people, our 
2011 lives overlap sonically in some 
places and diverge in others. But 
music makes it easier to draw lines 
between different lives — much 
in the same way my mom noted to 
me as we left the theater how much 
my dad loved the song that plays 
over the film’s credits, “Why Can’t I 
Touch It?” by The Buzzcocks.

“20th Century Women” gets a lot 

of criticism for being plotless and 
untethered. And that’s valid, but 
also not necessarily a fault of the 
film. Because instead of adhering 
to a traditional plot structure, the 
film borrows its structure from a 
playlist — an assembly of tracks 
(in this case scenes) that exist 
without a destination or endpoint. 
So instead of coming down to finish 
its arc, “20th Century Women” 
ends soaring, quite literally, and 
pleading, “You must remember 
this.” And with its soundtrack, it 
gives you the tools to do just that, to 
remember.

Since 2015, Raf Simons has left 

Dior, Hedi Slimane departed Saint 
Laurent, Alber Elbaz moved on 
from Lanvin and Alexander Wang 
made room for Demna Gvasalia at 
Balenciaga. Most recently, however, 
was Riccardo Tisci’s announcement 
that he will depart from Givenchy 
after over a decade with the fash-
ion house. Admittedly, I was never 
a huge fan of Tisci or his work at 
Givenchy, but I think it would be 
foolish to understate the scope of 
his accomplishments in the twelve 
years spent at the French brand. 
In his time spent at the helm of 
Givenchy, Tisci was able to help 
the label rebound from a period of 
stagnation under John Galliano, 
Alexander McQueen and Julien 
Macdonald. He did this by finding 
a way to create a distinct image that 
could draw in a large audience. The 
house’s success had flatlined under 
a few creative directors because the 
brand’s collections had little-to-no 
cohesion, and Tisci was able to put 
an end to that. Where Hubert de 
Givenchy’s original designs were 
made iconic by Audrey Hepburn, 
Tisci was able to draw in the likes of 
Beyonce, Michelle Obama and Kim 
Kardashian to sport his designs on 
the red carpet and out in the Holly-
wood Hills.

Designer labels are always asso-

ciated with an exorbitant price tag, 
which means that the average con-
sumer of a brand like Givenchy is 

going to be quite wealthy. That said, 
there are some items, often popu-
larized by celebrities, that can tran-
scend this price-gap to the point 
where both middle-class and upper-
class people wear the garment as 
a badge of honor. Those currently 
unable to buy the piece will spend 
a month saving every cent possible 
from their paycheck in order to 
subsidize the purchase. Givenchy’s 
Rottweiler print has been a staple in 
designer fashion since 2011. These 

shirts will still sell for upwards of 
$500 on secondhand sites. In fact, I 
would argue that someone would be 
hard-pressed to find a more iconic 
graphic print at any other designer 
house.

Building on his ability to reach 

the streetwear demographic with 
his graphic tees, Tisci collaborated 
with Nike starting in 2014 on his 
NikeLab x RT collection, which 
features both apparel and footwear 
(some pretty cool and some not 
so much). While there’s no reason 
to imagine that his collaborations 
with Nike will not continue, the 
benefits of the symbiotic relation-
ship between Givenchy and the 
NikeLab x RT are hard to ignore. 
He was both able to draw the sneak-
erheads into his work at Given-
chy for consumers who aspired 
to dress like celebrities, and 
draw Givenchy consumers into 
purchasing highly sought-after 
Nike sneakers.

Not only was Tisci’s time 

at Givenchy good for building 
brand exposure, but it also was 
great for commercial success. 
According to WWD, Givenchy’s 
revenue has increased more 
than sixfold and the number of 
employees has increased over 
threefold since taking the reins 
in 2005, an incredible feat for a

While it’s unclear who will 

succeed Tisci at Givenchy (Vir-

unclear what Tisci’s next move 
will be. Maybe he will con-

it’s obvious that Tisci’s next

“Watching Gaga?!” I texted 

my 62-year-old father on Sun-
day evening.

“Fantastic,” he replied.
That pretty much sums it up. 

Lady Gaga kept me in awe for 
the 13 minutes of flying, fire and 
fierceness that was her Super 
Bowl 
halftime 
performance. 

Gaga has been quite outward 
about her political opinions in 
the past, but refrained from 
directly 
addressing 
politics 

despite the immense visibility 
of the Super Bowl platform. She 
noted in an interview with an 
Atlanta radio station that she 
wanted to refrain from “saying 
anything divisive.” By doing so, 
Gaga managed to unite viewers 
in her electric performance and 
let the mantras of her music do 
the talking. 

Atop the upper edge of Hous-

ton’s NRG stadium, Gaga began 
sentimentally, crooning a mash-
up of “God Bless America” and 
“This Land is Your Land.” She 
then dropped into her speak-
ing voice to recite a segment of 
the Pledge of Allegiance. “One 
nation, under God, indivisible, 
with liberty and justice,” she 
paused briefly, cocked her head 
a little, and finished the phrase, 
“for all” with a little lift in her 
voice. Her slight tone change 
seemed to say, “Remember? the 
core of our country is really that 
simple — liberty and justice (and 
football) for everyone.”

Gaga managed to keep herself 

remarkably cool and collected 
during this patriotic intro — all 
while knowing she was about 
to launch herself head-first off 
of the 260-foot-high roof the 

stadium. In hindsight, her com-
posure was stunning. I bun-
gee jumped off a 360 foot high 
bridge last summer, and could 
not even form words leading up 
to the jump because I was shak-
ing so aggressively. But I digress. 
After this intro, Gaga flung her-
self off of the stadium’s edge 
in a squirmy, spider-woman-
like sprawl. She landed cleanly 
on a platform, clearly high on 
adrenaline, and belted “I’m on 
the edge!” before breaking into 
a fierce, metallic shoulder bop 
during the intro of “Poker Face.”

A few airborne maneuvers 

later, a harnessed Lady Gaga 
planted firmly on the stage for 
an energetic rendition of “Born 
This Way.” Iconic for its cel-
ebration of diversity, the ballad 
was accompanied by troupe of 
multiracial dancers who sur-
rounded Gaga as she sang, “No 
matter black, white or beige…
I was born to be brave.” This 
ode 
to 
self-acceptance 
and 

love is inherently political, and 
the artist let the lyrics ring as 
the instrumentation silenced 
when she sang, “No matter gay, 
straight or bi, lesbian, transgen-
dered life, I’m on the right track 
baby I was born to survive” 
while the crowd clapped along. 
The combination of the chore-
ography and the anthem was 
electric, collective and intoxi-
cating. How could you not clap 
(or excitedly hip-shake) along?

Lady Gaga literally did not 

skip a beat while transitioning 
into “Telephone.” The pop mon-
ster’s captivating weirdness sur-
faced here and flowed into “Just 
Dance.” Some of the highlights 
included: An oversized star 
spear, Gaga convulsing sideways 
in a random man’s arms, a male 
dance squad doing *NSYNC-
like moves while wearing spiky 

puffer coats and Gaga using a 
dancer as a human mic stand 
while playing a keytar. Need-
less to say, she kept me in a jaw-
dropped trance for what was 
then a seven minute mashup of 
my middle school jams.

By this point, my roommate 

and I had our money on a Joanne 
reveal — specifically “Perfect 
Illusion” ’s notorious key change 
— but instead Gaga simmered 
down into a candlelit “Million 
Reasons.” She utilized this mel-
low piano ballad to put things in 
perspective. She asked “Amer-
ica — world — how you doing 
tonight?” While undoubtedly 
aware of the huge scope of her 
performance, Gaga seemed gen-
uinely grounded — she juxta-
posingly shouted out, “Hey dad, 
hi mom,” after the first chorus. 
The singer even ventured into 
the audience to hug one of her 
starstruck fans before vamp-
ing it up for the “Bad Romance” 
finale.

By the end of what may have 

been the quickest 13 minutes of 
my life, Lady Gaga reminded me 
of what true dedication to art of 
live entertainment looks like. 
She reminded me of what it feels 
like to be moved into movement, 
to dance along to a song about 
diversity and inclusivity (“Born 
This Way”), as well one that 
simply celebrates dancing (“Just 
Dance”). While Gaga neglected 
to capitalize on the Super Bowl’s 
111.3 million viewers to voice her 
opinion of the current political 
climate, her values rang clear-
ly, accessibly and attractively 
through her music. Lady Gaga 
reaffirmed the power of the arts 
to bridging gaps: She used the 
spirit of music not only to voice 
her beliefs, but to inspire people 
(even 62-year-old dads) to sing 
along with her.

A visit to Jenkins’s past

FILM NOTEBOOK

With “Moonlight” racking up 

eight Academy Award nomina-
tions, director Barry Jenkins 
is one of the year’s most loved 
critic’s darling. But once upon 
a time, he was a scrappy young 
filmmaker trying to make it like 
everyone else. His first student 
film, “My Josephine” is a peek 
into that era. 

He tweeted that sharing the 

film was “a reminder to myself 
to channel this energy, to cre-
ate.”

Written and directed shortly 

after 9/11, the film follows two 
Arab immigrants, Aadid and 
Adela, working in a laundro-
mat, cleaning US flags for free 
in the wake of the attack.

In a contemplative Arabic 

voiceover, Aadid recalls the 
story of Napolean Bonaparte’s 
first wife Josaphine, the one 
he married for love. Adela is 
his Josephine. With the rever-
ence he gives to the American 
flags, it seems that his country 
is, too.

Aadid’s words take shape 

with the film’s lyrical cinema-
tography. In woozy green-blue 
hues, the camera alternates 
between blurriness and focus. 
A moving screen filled entirely 
with light or darkness sharp-
ens into focus, revealing Adela, 
the laundromat, the American 
flag – the pillars around which 

Aadid’s life is built.

Like with “Moonlight,” Jen-

kins prioritizes the personal 
over the political, and in doing 
so, achieves both. He zeroes in 
on the lives of his characters, 
drawing out empathic details 
from ordinary Americans living 
ordinary lives.

At a time where their loyalty 

to the country is questioned, 
Aadid and Adela exhibit the 
fundamental 
guiding 
prin-

ciples of the American Dream. 
That despite discrimination, 
their patriotic love for America 
endures. Work hard. Build a 
new life. Fall in love.

Aadid and Adela sit on fold-

ing chairs outside the laun-
dromat talking for hours, they 
dance late in the night. He out-
lines the care they take when 
washing the flags, to protect 
and preserve the dignity inher-
ent in the stars and stripes. A 
murky underwater shot shows 
arms reaching out to softly 
brush their fingers against the 
American flag, to grasp the 
American Dream in their own 
hands.

Jenkins’s body of work is 

a welcome addition to main-
stream media. “Moonlight” ‘s 
overwhelming critical popu-
larity represents a shift in the 
way the general public receives 
films featuring black charac-
ters. In the past, most of the 
Black Oscar winners have come 
from roles as slaves or domestic 
maids, like “12 Years a Slave” 

or “The Help.” This reveals a 
critical fact about viewer pro-
clivities: The majority white 
Oscar voters are more likely to 
appreciate storylines featur-
ing minority characters if they 
support their vision of what a 
“minority life” entails.

The missing step is to encour-

age more than just diversity 
— a numbers game, increasing 
the number of minority faces 
on screen and in high-level 
roles behind the scene — but 
also inclusion, which involves 
understanding all facets of 
people’s lives. Inclusion means 
engaging with stories about 
racial oppression and discrimi-
nation, but at the same time, 
also taking care to hear the 
other parts of people of color’s 
lives, too. Both of these compo-
nents are critical to improving 
media representation.

Jenkins is one of many tal-

ented filmmakers of color who 
tell honest stories about ordi-
nary characters. Most of them 
go unnoticed by mainstream 
audiences not because they 
are objectively better or worse 
than films about the history of 
oppression, but simply because 
they feature themes that the 
general public is not as inter-
ested in. Jenkins’s success in 
this year’s Oscar nominations 
signals that audiences may 
finally begin to appreciate a 
wider variety of storylines, and 
take early steps in the direction 
of inclusion.

Michigan must move on

Entering the 2017 season, the 
Michigan baseball team has a 
daunting task ahead of it: the 
Wolverines must figure out how 
to move forward after losing 
players to both the MLB Draft and 
graduation. 
Roster 
turnover 
proves 
particularly difficult in sports like 
baseball, where college athletic 
careers of core players are often 
cut short due to the MLB draft. 
Michigan is no exception as it faces 
the lofty obstacle of replenishing 
its roster after several significant 
departures.
The Wolverines lost three key 
talents to the 2016 MLB Draft – 
junior pitcher Brett Adcock, junior 
first baseman Carmen Benedetti 
and senior pitcher Evan Hill. In 
addition to the draftees, Michigan 
graduated four seniors – including 
2016 
batting 
average 
leader 
outfielder Cody Bruder, stolen base 
leader outfielder Matt Ramsay and 
team captain catcher Dominic 
Jamett.
Led by the eventual draftees 
and now graduated seniors, the 
Wolverines 
found 
moderate 
success in 2016, finishing with a Big 
Ten record of 13-10 and an overall 
record of 35-19. Their consistent 
play earned them the fifth seed at 
the Big Ten tournament, where 
they were eliminated by Ohio State 
in the first round.
Losing significant starters may 
be detrimental to the production of 
both the offense and the pitching 
staff 
this 
season. 
However, 
Michigan is used to this sort 
of turnover. In 2015, Michigan 
had three players drafted and 
graduated seven seniors. Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich recognizes that 
constant rebuilding is just a part of 
the sport.
“[The MLB Draft] is the nature 
of the beast in quality programs,” 
Bakich said. “You try to build the 
best program that you can build. 
One of the impacts of that is the 
players have opportunities to move 
onto professional baseball.”

Even with some players gone, 
junior infielder Jake Bivens is 
confident that Michigan can fill 
these voids.
“We lost some key contributors,” 
Bivens said. “Definitely guys have 
to step up. But we have a great 
group that can step right into 
those roles and fill those spots 
immediately.”
While the production of those 
players and their positions in 
the lineup can be replaced, the 
elements that don’t show up in the 
box score — experience, chemistry 
and locker room leadership — are 
harder to replicate.
The Wolverines must overcome 
losing the experience of seven 
veterans 
and 
the 
leadership 
of a trusted captain in Jamett. 
Continuing 
these 
intangibles 
will be necessary for Michigan to 
continue its success and elevate to 
the next level.
Drew Lugbauer isn’t worried, 
though. The junior infielder feels 
the closeness of the current roster 
will carry the team.
“[The team’s chemistry] is 
probably the best since I’ve been 
here,” Lugbauer said. “Everyone’s 
really tight. We all get along with 
each other. It’s a good locker room.”
Junior pitcher Oliver Jaskie 
added: “There’s not one guy on 
this team that I wouldn’t call a best 
friend or a brother.”
In order for the team to succeed 
this 
season, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
chemistry and new leadership 
will prove vital. Michigan will 
look for leadership from senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson and 
senior pitcher Jackson Lamb, both 
of whom were selected in the 2016 
MLB draft, but elected to stay at 
Michigan for their senior seasons.
Despite losing seven players 
total, 
the 
Wolverines 
return 
12 
upperclassmen. 
With 
the 
returning players’ experience and 
talent, Michigan expects a strong 
season.
“There’s high expectations,” 
Jaskie said. “But we’re ready for 
it. We’re just focused on going out 
there and playing as hard as we 
can.” 

Penalty kill fails ‘M’

Ohio State’s first power-play 
goal came from forward Tanner 
Laczynski, but the Michigan 
hockey team still had a two-goal 
lead. Not much, but enough to 
keep the crowd at Yost Ice Arena 
from panicking on Friday night. 
Two 
goals 
from 
the 
Wolverines 
later, 
Michigan 
entered the third period sitting 
on a 5-1 lead. But the 12th-ranked 
Buckeyes still had 1:21 remaining 
of 
a 
second-period 
power 
play, and six seconds into the 
third, forward Nick Schilkey 
capitalized.
Within the next few seconds, 
they scored again, and later in 
the period once more to put the 
game within tying distance. 
Although it wasn’t enough to 
secure an impressive comeback 
and win the game, it was enough 
to scare the Wolverine fan base.
On Saturday, though, Ohio 
State managed to do exactly 
what it needed to, scraping past 
Michigan, 6-5.
Out of the Buckeyes’ 10 goals 
this past weekend, seven of 
them came during power plays. 
While Ohio State is notable for 
its power play — after the series, 
it’s ranked No. 1 in the Big Ten 
— Michigan’s penalty kill wasn’t 
shaping up into what it needed to 
be. In Saturday’s game, it could 
have made all the difference. 
“I’m giving the other team’s 
power play their due,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“They’re a good power play, but 
they’re not that good. They’re 
not a 50 percent power play. We 
shouldn’t be giving up four goals 
on seven chances or three on 
six. That’s what we did over the 
weekend. That’s on us.”
Earlier 
in 
the 
season, 
Michigan 
was 
ranked 
10th 
in the penalty kill. But after 
their 
recent 
performances, 
the Wolverines have dropped 
to the bottom of the Big Ten. 
The penalty kill almost cost 
Michigan the game on Friday — 
and it did on Saturday.
For the Wolverines, it isn’t just 
the penalty kill that’s coming up 
short. There are compounding 

issues that lead to such high-
scoring games. The number 
of penalties Michigan took on 
Saturday was too many to give to 
a team with such an established 
power play.
“If our forecheck is doing 
well, right away that helps us 
out,” said freshman goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne. 
“If 
our 
forecheck isn’t doing that great 
but we’re shutting them down 
real quick when they get into 
the zone then once again, it’s 
fine. But it was kind of one of 
those things where we weren’t 
doing a good job forechecking 
the whole time, we didn’t really 
track back hard. We just kind 
of let them set up into their 
structure easily.”
The number of penalties and 
the execution of the penalty kill 
weren’t good signs for Michigan. 
Both factors contributed to the 
close nature of the weekend’s 
games despite arguably two of 
its best offensive games this 
season.
But the issues aren’t just 
stemming from the execution of 
the penalty kill, either.
“First and foremost, I think 
it starts with the faceoff,” said 
freshman forward Jake Slaker. 
“Including myself, I think the 
centermen haven’t been the best 
in the defensive zone in faceoffs 
during the penalty kill. That 
right away loses possession, 
and they get an easy start to the 
power play, so that’s definitely a 
frustrating thing I think we can 
improve on.
“It’s 
one 
thing 
leads 
to 
another. Guy taking a penalty, 
centerman loses the faceoff, the 
guys not executing on the ice. It 
definitely builds up.”
There’s 
no 
doubt 
the 
Wolverines stepped up their 
offensive game this past weekend 
against Ohio State. With junior 
forward Tony Calderone — who 
is leading in goals with 10 — and 
senior forward Alex Kile and 
junior forward Cutler Martin 
out of both games, the tables 
easily could have been turned.
But a win on Saturday could 
have resulted in Michigan’s first 
sweep of the season — something 
that won’t come anytime soon if 

Hutchins confident in underclassmen to step up

After 32 seasons as the coach 
of the Michigan softball team, 
Carol Hutchins knows the trials 
and tribulations that come with 
being an underclassman in college 
softball — especially for those who 
are asked to contribute early in 
their careers. 
Gone are the days of second 
baseman Sierra Romero, outfielder 
Sierra Lawrence and the rest of 
one of the most accomplished 
senior classes in school history. 
And the onus to fill that void may 
have to fall on the shoulders of the 
underclassmen on the roster.
“The game doesn’t know if 
you’re a freshman or a senior,” 
Hutchins said. “When you get the 
opportunity to be out there, you 
need to be ready to go, and not ‘Oh, 
I’m a freshman.’ To push everyone 
every day, period — that’s what we 
want our freshmen to do.”
The Wolverines lost three of the 
top four hitters in their lineup from 
last season — Romero, Lawrence 
and outfielder Kelsey Susalla — 
all to graduation. Between them, 

Michigan is losing 41 home runs, 
179 RBI and 195 runs scored. The 
trio accounted for 42 percent of the 
total runs scored by last season’s 
prolific offense, which finished 
second in the country in offense at 
7.90 runs per game.
Granted, it’s unfair to expect 
any three individuals to step in 
and match that type of production, 
especially for the untested players 
who Hutchins expects to be 
thrown into the fire early. 
Sophomore Faith Canfield, who 
Hutchins dubbed “the leading 
candidate” to play second base, 
will likely have the unenviable task 
of replacing Romero. Freshmen 
under Hutchins tend to play 
sparingly, but last season Canfield 
was an exception to the norm, 
carving out a role as a utility player. 
She appeared in 44 out of 59 games, 
managing a .268 batting average 
and scoring 22 runs. Those are 
hardly eye-popping numbers by 
traditional standards, but certainly 
commendable for a freshman on a 
senior-laden team.
Lawrence and Susalla will be 
equally difficult to replace in their 
corner outfield spots. Perhaps 

nobody knows that better than 
senior outfielder Kelly Christner, 
who spent the last two seasons 
manning the outfield with the duo.
“Between 
me, 
Sierra 
and 
Kelsey, we kind of knew how each 
other worked,” Christner said. 
“We kind of vibed really well. We 
worked together really well for two 
straight years, so it is hard to work 
with different people.”
But as a senior leader, Christner 
knows it is incumbent on her to try 
and emulate that chemistry, even 
if it takes the form of a different 
identity. 
She 
recognizes 
the 
inherent challenge of working with 
— and leading — new players.
“I think (the challenge is) more 
just letting the girls know that are 
going to be playing now how we 
work out there, and really focusing 
on communication between the 
three of us,” Christner said. “I 
think this fall we’ve worked really 
well together, and I’m excited to 
get out there.”
One of those new outfielders 
will 
almost 
undoubtedly 
be 
sophomore Natalie Peters, who 
Hutchins spoke glowingly of in her 
season-opening media day. 

Despite little experience, Peters 
— whose game is predicated 
on contact and speed — will be 
counted on toward the top of the 
order. In just 16 at-bats last season, 
Peters managed a .313 batting 
average, with all five of her hits 
being singles. In an expanded role, 
Peters will be counted on heavily to 
set the table at the top part of the 
order.
“She came back a new woman 
from freshman to sophomore 
year,” Hutchins said. “And she had 
some good experience last year, but 
she’s been a very consistent player 
for us since she got back in the fall.”
The other outfield spot seems 
less certain, but it, too, will likely be 
manned by a younger player. Only 
one other outfielder on the roster is 
older than a sophomore.
But while Hutchins knows 
she’ll need production from some 
unproven players, that dependence 
hardly seems to concern her.
“We don’t know what’s going 
to happen with the unseasoned 
players, but we need some of the 
unseasoned players to step up,” 
Hutchins said. “The pleasant part 
of the job is somebody does step up 
usually.”
And if history is any indication, 
that unknown boost could be 
expected to come from one of the 
sophomores. 
Under 
Hutchins, 
the 
freshman-to-sophomore 
transition traditionally comes with 
the biggest statistical leap.
Christner’s 
production 
ballooned during her sophomore 
season: increasing her average by 
94 points, hitting 18 more home 
runs and knocking in 50 more runs 
than the year prior. Blanco slugged 
312 points better during her 
sophomore season. Even Romero 
saw her average increase 112 points 
from her freshman to sophomore 
campaign. And the list could go on.
With the heart of the order gone 
from last season, the pressure will 
undoubtedly be on the entire team 
to step up its production to try to 
make up for those losses. Yet for 
the Wolverines, the better question 
may not be if someone will step up, 
but rather who.

Wolverines set for first game as ranked team

The No. 21 Michigan women’s 
basketball team has enjoyed 
nothing more than playing at 
home this season. Following a 
72-70, comeback victory over 
Iowa, the Wolverines are now 
12-0 at Crisler Center.
But all teams must play on 
the road sometimes. Michigan, 
who is 5-4 in true road games 
this season, will travel to West 
Lafayette to take on Purdue 
on 
Wednesday 
night. 
The 
Boilermakers, winners of three 
of their last four games, will 
present a formidable challenge 
for the Wolverines (8-2 Big Ten, 
19-5 overall).
Despite being ranked 95th in 
the Ratings Percentage Index, 
Purdue (6-4, 15-9) boasts the 
Big Ten’s best scoring defense, 
allowing just 58.0 points per 
game, which is 39th nationally. 
The Boilermakers rank fourth 
in the conference in 3-point 
defense, 
with 
opponents 
making just 38 percent of their 
shots from beyond the arc.
“Purdue was a team that had 
a slow start, had some young 
kids,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico on WTKA. “But 
they are playing extremely well 
as of late. They are a team that’s 
coming on strong in our league. 
It’s going to be a tough matchup 
for us.”
Statistically 
though, 
Michigan presents a defensive 
unit that is almost as strong. 
The Wolverines have held their 
opponents to 59.3 points per 
game and 38.2 percent 3-point 
shooting — second and fifth 
in the Big Ten, respectively. 
Sophomore 
center 
Hallie 
Thome has also contributed 48 
blocks to the defensive effort 
this season.
Due to the prowess of both 
defenses, 
a 
relatively 
low-
scoring contest may be in the 
cards in West Lafayette. 
Michigan 
does 
hold 
a 
significant 
advantage 
over 
Purdue 
with 
its 
offense, 
though. The Wolverines rank 
third in the conference and 14th 
nationally in scoring offense, 
averaging 79.7 points per game. 

Michigan’s biggest offensive 
strength is its 3-point shooting, 
as the Wolverines are second 
only to Connecticut nationally, 
making 40.7 percent of their 
3-pointers.
The 
Boilermakers, 
meanwhile, rank 10th in the 
Big Ten in scoring offense, 
as 
they 
are 
averaging 
just 
66.9 points. This 
gap in offensive 
firepower 
may 
very 
well 
be 
Michigan’s 
key to victory 
Wednesday.
The 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 
success is due 
in 
large 
part 
to the familiar trio of Thome, 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
and newcomer freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick, who are all 
scoring at least 14 points per 
game. Gondrezick is coming off 
her best week yet, combining 
for 42 points, 10 rebounds and 

10 assists in two contests.
“To be a freshman and 
to 
make 
the 
impacts 
that 
(Gondrezick) 
has 
on 
an 
experienced team, I think just 
speaks volumes to the type of 
player that she is.” Barnes Arico 
said.
But 
Michigan 
has 
also 
benefitted from 
production 
off 
the bench as of 
late. Sophomore 
guard 
Nicole 
Munger scored 
seven 
points, 
including 
the 
game-
winning 
field 
goal, 
against 
the 
Hawkeyes 
on 
Sunday. 
If 
Munger 
can 
continue to perform like she did 
Sunday, it will provide a major 
boost to the Wolverines.
“Nicole 
was 
incredible,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She was 
all over the place. She provides 
such a spark for us. She’s been 
battling an injury all year 

long, so we’re really aware of 
how many minutes she’s been 
playing, and we’re trying to be 
smart about it.”
Though Michigan will be 
the favorite against Purdue, 
there is another factor the 
Wolverines will have to deal 
with — Wednesday will mark 
the first time in any of the 
current players’ careers that 
they will play as a ranked team. 
Michigan was last ranked the 
week of Jan. 21, 2013.
“I talked to our kids a little 
bit yesterday after the game,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I said, 
‘Hey, now we’re the team that 
everyone puts a circle around.’ 
We’re a ranked team. They’re 
going to have an opportunity 
to beat a ranked opponent. So 
that’s different and it’s not a 
position we’ve been in before. 
We need to make sure that we 
continue to improve and really 
focus on one game at a time.”
This Wolverine squad has not 
been like past ones, though, and 
they will look to continue that 
trend in West Lafayette.

Walton joins historic club in win

With less than a minute 
left in the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s game against 
Michigan State, the crowd, led 
by the Maize Rage, starting 
chanting Derrick Walton Jr.’s 
name in unison.
The senior guard, though, 
wasn’t 
on 
the 
court. 
He 
was 
sitting 
comfortably on 
the bench next 
to his teammates 
as he watched 
Michigan coach 
John 
Beilein 
substitute 
the end of his 
bench into the 
Wolverines’ 
86-57 
victory 
at Crisler Center on Tuesday 
night.
Walton willed the team to 
victory with 20 points, eight 
assists and five rebounds. It 
was a stat line that was just 
good enough to give him 400 
assists in his career, and he 
joined an elite group of past 
Michigan players in Jalen Rose 
and Gary Grant who have all 
recorded at least 1,000 points, 
400 rebounds and 400 assists 
in their Wolverine careers.
“It’s an honor,” Walton said. 
“I didn’t notice it, and I didn’t 
know what was going on. When 
they told me, I was in awe.
“I’m 
thankful 
for 
the 
opportunity 
to 
come 
to 
(Michigan), 
thankful 
for 
(Beilein) having faith in a 
young kid from Detroit and that 
he trusts me to run this team.”
It’s been a long time coming 
for the Detroit native, and to 
have it come against Michigan 
State made it just a bit sweeter. 
It was Michigan’s first win 
over its in-state rival in over 
three years. Walton was just 
a freshman the last time the 
Wolverines celebrated a win 
over the Spartans.
“It means a lot to me,” Walton 
said. “I’m an inner-city kid, and 
there’s a couple Michigan guys 
on that team. Having bragging 

rights with my little brother, 
(Michigan State guard Cassius 
Winston), is always fun.” 
Three years ago, Walton was 
just a role player on a team 
abundant with talent. Now, 
Walton is the leader on a team 
right on the edge of the NCAA 
Tournament, 
a 
completely 
different situation from the one 
Michigan was in three years 
prior.
“I can’t say 
enough 
about 
Derrick Walton 
right 
now,” 
Beilein said. “He 
came in (as a 
freshman) with 
a 
star-studded 
team. 
He 
was 
sort 
of 
forced 
into 
being 
a 
leader before he 
was really ready 
to do that. 
“I 
think 
he’s 
finally 
comfortable 
with 
all 
the 
experience (over his Michigan 
career) to really play with that 
‘extra’ that you need to be a 
really good player.”
While Walton made a huge 
impact in the game, there was 
nothing abnormal about his stat 
line. It was the same Walton 
that had averaged 18.6 points, 
4.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists 
in his last eight 
games.
What 
was 
different, 
though, 
was 
his 
teammates. 
From sophomore 
forward 
Moritz Wagner 
dominating 
Spartan forward 
Nick Ward inside 
to junior guard 
Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-
Rakhman stepping up to score 
16 points, it was the players 
around Walton that made the 
difference.
That was where Walton, the 
leader of the team, made the 
biggest impact.
Michigan’s season has varied 
wildly from the Wolverines’ 
30-point 
win 
over 
Indiana 

two weeks ago to Michigan’s 
lackluster 
performance 
on 
Saturday in its loss to Ohio 
State. It’s an alarming trend 
that has set the Wolverines 
back multiple times this season, 
and Walton wanted a change.
So, he has recently started 
to push his teammates harder 
than he ever has because he 
knows the potential of his 
team. And Tuesday night, his 
teammates repaid him.
“That was very important 
for us, to get that win for Mr. 
Walton over there,” Wagner 
said. “He played a heck of a 
game.”
Added Walton: “Before the 
game, the guys really banded 
together and told me they really 
wanted to get this for me, and 
they played like it. I’m really 
appreciative of it all. Everybody 
played their heart out.”
But even after a big win over 
Michigan State, the schedule 
doesn’t get any easier. The 
Wolverines will have seven 
games left to improve their 
NCAA 
Tournament 
resume. 
However, five of the seven come 
on the road, where Michigan is 
winless this season, while it 
will also host No. 7 Wisconsin 
and No. 16 Purdue. Walton 
knows 
that, 
and 
knowing 
the 
opportunity 
his 
team 
has 
ahead, 
he 
chooses to look 
at the positives.
“We 
have 
seven 
games 
left, and I think 
we 
can 
still 
do 
something 
special,” Walton 
said.
Even 
if 
he 
didn’t know he 
had joined the 
1000-point, 
400-rebound 
and 400-assist club until after 
he came off the court, he knew 
one thing for sure. He knew 
the score, and for just the third 
time in his Michigan career, 
the Wolverines had more points 
than the Spartans at the end of 
the game.
And for Walton, that’s all 
that matters. 

Wolverines rout Spartans in rivalry rematch

DJ Wilson received the pass 
from 
senior 
guard 
Derrick 
Walton Jr. in the low post. The 
redshirt sophomore forward was 
surrounded by four Michigan 
State defenders, but he gathered 
himself, elevated and threw down 
a dunk with authority. 
But that wasn’t enough for 
him. Wilson landed, turned to 
Spartan forward Kenny Goins, 
and screamed in his ear as if it 
wasn’t clear enough what had just 
happened.
Wilson was assessed a technical 
foul, but the Michigan men’s 
basketball team still led by 17, and 
the play was full of a fire that felt 
like it was a part of a different era 
and belonged to a different team 
— the same one that motivated the 
black socks and black shoes they 
took the floor in.
That team was the Fab Five — a 
group of five freshmen that took 
college basketball by storm with a 
swagger that people weren’t ready 
to accept.
Along 
with 
that 
swagger, 
came results. In a two-year 
stretch, the Wolverines went 3-1 
against Michigan State, made 
it to two NCAA Tournament 
championships and filled Crisler 
Center with ease.
But that was then, Tuesday 
night was now, and Michigan 
was in dire need of a dose of that 
same swagger that electrified the 
program from 1991 – 1993.
And by the time the final 
buzzer 
sounded, 
the 
black 
socks and black shoes fit, as the 
Wolverines brought a new edge 
against the Spartans (6-5 Big Ten, 
14-10 overall) that was lacking in 
East Lansing nine days prior en 
route to an 86-57 victory at Crisler 
Center.
“You can be pretty consistent 
about (what) guys are gonna make 
shots,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “But what type of edge are 
they gonna play with? That’s hard. 
And is the edge too much that they 
get emotionally drunk during the 

game?
“… Today was like perfect. 
They were right there, they were 
angry, they were junkyard dogs. 
That was the whole idea — a 
picture of, like, a Doberman that 
I wanted them to go out and play 
like. I think it was a Doberman, 
but it had big teeth.”
The Wolverines (5-6, 15-9) 
essentially put the game to bed 
in the first half. In the final 8:20 
of the frame, Michigan notched a 
32-10 run — going 12-for-15 from 
the floor — and finished with a 
55-29 advantage.
The 
early 
blowout 
was 
indicative of a first half in which 
the Wolverines’ offense caught 
fire, as Michigan finished shooting 
75 percent from the field and 72.7 
percent from three. Walton played 
like a man possessed, leading the 
offensive surge to the tune of 12 
points and seven assists.
Behind 
Walton, 
sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 
Wagner 
and 
junior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman ended the frame 
with 13 and 10 points, respectively.
But 
the 
Wolverines 
also 
received contributions from the 

most unlikely of places. Freshman 
guard Xavier Simpson provided 
Walton with invaluable relief 
off the bench and catalyzed the 
offense with a tangible confidence 
that has been absent this season, 
eventually finishing the game with 
seven points and two assists.
The matchup could have gotten 
away from the Spartans even 
earlier if Michigan had capitalized 
on turnovers in the early stages.
The 
Wolverines 
managed 
to draw a charge, force a shot-
clock violation and get a stop 
on Michigan State’s first three 
possessions, but couldn’t reap the 
benefits — entering the first media 
timeout up just 9-8.
Still, 
Michigan 
eventually 
managed to make the Spartans pay 
for being careless with the ball, 
finishing the game with 30 points 
off Michigan State’s 21 turnovers. 
Some of the turnovers were self-
inflicted, but the Wolverines did 
manage to force four shot-clock 
violations, notch six steals and 
hold the Spartans to 48 percent 
shooting form the floor.
“Some of it’s understandable,” 
said Michigan State coach Tom 

Izzo. “Like I said, you look at those 
seniors and they’ve lost four or five 
times (to us). And I thought they 
played with an incredible passion. 
Our freshmen did not match that.”
On the opposite end of the court, 
Michigan’s offense cooled off in 
the second half but still managed 
to finish the game shooting 60 
percent.
Walton built off his first-half 
success to finish with a game-high 
20 points on 7-for-10 shooting, all 
while pitching in eight assists and 
five rebounds. Wagner and Abdur-
Rahkman continued to follow 
Walton’s lead, finishing with 19 
and 16 points, respectively.
The 
matchups 
with 
the 
Spartans have always meant more 
to Walton — a Detroit native — 
than they have to his teammates. 
But on Tuesday night, due in large 
part to the edge he set from the 
start, that wasn’t the case.
So as his night was capped off 
with an induction into Michigan’s 
1,000-point, 
400-rebound 
and 
400-assist club, it seemed fitting 
that there are just two other 
members of that club: Gary Grant 
and Jalen Rose.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | FEBRUARY 8, 2017


D

riving 
back 
from 

the 
beach, 
from 

my cousins’ house, 

from soccer games and swim 
meets, I always knew where 
I was. The familiarity of 
the 
Pennsylvania 
woods, 

the highway signs of 95 
and Route 1, and the Eagles 
stickers on the backs of cars 
reminded me I was never 
far from home. I had always 
considered Philadelphia and 
the East Coast my home, 
and although I still love it, 
the concept of “home” has 
changed significantly for me 
over the years.

I was moving into college 

when I took my first road 
trip by myself (well, with my 
dog in the passenger seat), 
and I knew I would not be 
returning home from this 
trip. Michigan was a foreign 
place with new interstates 
and different woods. I was 
driving from Philadelphia to 
Ann Arbor –– a 10-hour trip 
of mountain ranges, farmland 
and tunnels. 

I remember driving past 

Toledo when it became dark. 
My mom and my sister were 
in another car, which was 
out of sight at this point, but 
I knew we would be in Ann 
Arbor within the next hour. 
Even with that in mind, it 
was dark and I was lost. I hit 
Detroit traffic, and I realized 
how far away I was from 
Wawa and Phillies fans. I was 
alone, distant from everyone 

and everything I knew.

To calm my anxiety, I 

remembered the rubies and 
diamonds.

The story goes as follows: 

When my mother was young, 
the long drives home from the 
Jersey Shore to Montclair, a 
town in northern Jersey, sent 
her into a daze of boredom. 
My grandpa would watch the 
cars move with him and past 
him on New Jersey Route 4.

Trying to pass time, she 

asked my grandpa how to 
entertain herself to distract 
her from the swallowing 
darkness of night and bright 
lights of the surrounding 
cars. He hold her, “Imagine 
the lights in front of us are a 

string of rubies, and the lights 
coming toward us are a string 
of diamonds.”

I like to think that my 

mother pictured the highway 
full of zooming, psychedelic 
gems. But maybe she rolled 
her eyes and drifted off to 
sleep.

The story of the car gems 

was carried from my grandpa 
to my mom to me. Maybe it 
was just something to pass 
time, but to me it’s so much 
more. It’s a mechanism for 
grounding, 
appreciating 

and 
acknowledging 
my 

surroundings.

Although my first trip to 

college consisted of driving 
through unfamiliar places 

just to arrive at another 
unfamiliar 
place, 
not 

everything about this moment 
made me feel alienated.

The string of rubies and 

diamonds 
in 
the 
Detroit 

traffic was the same string 
of gems I’d seen many times 
before. That same string 
reminds me that this is still 
life, just in a new place; no 
matter where I drive, there 
will always be the same cars, 
the same traffic, the same 
routines.

The concept came to me 

again the first time I flew 
alone on an airplane. Once 
I took off, I looked below 
at highways of rubies and 
diamonds, 
and 
I 
looked 

into the sky, where blinking 
airplane lights became rubies 
and distant stars became 
diamonds. I wasn’t in one 
single place, on the ground or 
in a home. I was alone in the 
vacant space of the clouds, 
building a place for myself 
because that was all I really 
had and all I really have.

I don’t believe I have a place 

to consider home. My family 
lives in three different states, 
and a college apartment 
doesn’t really suffice. As a 
kid, I believed I could only go 
back to one place: that home 
on Fairhill Drive. By moving 
to Michigan, I distanced 
myself 
from 
everything 

I knew and everything I 
thought was true. And with 
that, I was able to — I’ve had 
to — create a type of “home” 
in myself wherever I go. 

My grandpa’s message of 

rubies and diamonds is a 
way to ground myself in my 
familial roots, creating the 
feeling that I have family and 
familiarity no matter where 
I am. It’s something to hold 
on to.

During my adventure in 

Detroit, I remember looking 
over to my dog, Wesley, curled 
up on the passenger seat. The 
red car lights shined through 
the car windshield and onto 
his black fur. I was hundreds 
of miles from Philadelphia, 
but maybe I wasn’t as far as 
I thought.

FEAR AND CLOTHING AT WAL-MART

BY HARRISON KRINSKY, DAILY ARTS WRITER

COVER DESIGN BY CLAIRE ABDO

ILLUSTRATION BY KATIE SPAK

L

ast Sunday, my friends dropped me off at a 
Wal-Mart in Saline and said, “See you in 12 
hours,” which is a strange thing to say, but 

in this case, it was exactly the right thing to say — I 
was going to be at Wal-Mart for 12 hours.

I was going to be at Wal-Mart for such an absurd 

amount of time for three main reasons. The first: I am 
a man of my word. The second: I came in last place 
in my fantasy football league, and the punishment 
for the person who came in last was to spend 12 
hours in a Wal-Mart. The third and maybe the most 
important (also definitely the most misguided): 
Some part of me thought it would be good for me.

As I walked through the extra-large revolving 

doors at approximately 12:34 p.m., I started 
thinking about a set of different books. This organic 
recollection of literature made me feel pretty good 
about myself because any time I think about a book 
— rather than force myself to think about a book 
— I feel intelligent and cultured. Five minutes into 
Wal-Mart and I’m already thinking about books. 
My hypothesis about the positive side-effects of 
extended Wal-Mart exposure were playing out just 
as I imagined.

The two books I thought of were “A Supposedly Fun 

Thing I’ll Never Do Again” by David Foster Wallace 
and “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” by Hunter 
S. Thompson. After realizing these two books are 
about as stereotypical-pseudo-intellectual-college-
student-starter-pack as it could get, I felt less good 
about myself — but still a little good about myself.

“Fear and Clothing, at Wal-Mart … get it?”
As I began to stroll through the kitchen appliances, 

I imagined myself walking with Dr. Thompson, 
taking mescaline and dancing from department to 
department, extracting truths about Wal-Mart, our 
broken political system and the human condition. 
I imagined the dystopian adventure I’d chronicle, 
going from aisle to aisle, in search of coffee filters 
and the American dream.

As I turned down the chilled aisle lined with 

sodas, I imagined myself with Wallace, scribbling a 
mixture of observations and my own idiosyncrasies 
into some witty transcendent truth. What does a 
30-rack of Mountain Dew do? How does a 30-rack 
of Mountain Dew make me feel, say, about my own 
latent elitism?

I had more humble visions too, as I walked through 

consumer electronics. Somewhere in this Wal-Mart, 
I felt, was an essay that could strike through partisan 
politics and hate and baggage and the 24-hour news 
cycle that makes people really really, really actually 

think.

1:35 p.m. Alas, reality sets in.
There are two Wal-Marts within a six-mile radius 

of my house in Ann Arbor. One of them, the one 
in Saline, is a Wal-Mart Supercenter, whereas the 
Wal-Mart in Ypsilanti is a regular non-super Wal-
Mart. I decided to go with the supercenter because I 
figured that would marginally increase the number 
of potential things I could do to occupy time.

I should have done more research because, while 

supercenters might be better than regular Wal-

Marts when it comes to shopping, they are far worse 
for maintaining sanity. The sensory overload you 
might expect to set in at hour five is scaled up in a 
supercenter. Each aisle of Wal-Mart smells, looks 
and feels distinctly different. The quilted fragrance 
palate bounces from Yankee candles to burnt plastic 
to lavender Febreeze and bleach, to slightly stale 
Subway, to WD-40 and on and on and on as you walk 
from aisle to aisle. The more “super” the Wal-Mart, 
the more smells, the more florescent lights, the more 
man-made microclimates.

There was no cafe attached to this Wal-Mart, only 

a Subway. So I left Wal-Mart and walked across the 
parking lot to a Bruegger’s Bagels. I ordered a coffee 
and some gross, bite-sized donuts and sat down to 

play Candy Crush on my phone. I thought about 
which was worse for my development as a human: an 
hour of binge drinking, or an hour of playing Candy 
Crush. Certainly the conventional answer is Candy 

Crush, but Hunter S. Thompson was an alcoholic 

and David Foster Wallace would have hated Candy 

Crush.

1:55 p.m. I returned to Wal-Mart, again in search 

of profundity and inspiration. No luck. I spent about 

an hour walking around aimlessly, listening to 

political podcasts.

The only thing I discovered was how many 

variations of some food types there are. There were 

like 11 different kinds of Oreos, and overly specific 
snacks I’d never imagined, such as Dunkin’ Donuts 

Vanilla Latte Pop-Tarts or low-fat honey-infused 

Pillsbury biscuits.

2:35 p.m. Defeated, I set up camp in the back-left 

corner of Subway. Wal-Mart has complimentary 

free Wi-Fi, obviously, so I was able to halfheartedly 

do my homework. It was here where I witnessed my 

only Wal-Mart magic.

Excerpt from my Wal-Mart notes:

3:45 to 4:05. Nobody is running the Subway attached 

to Wal-Mart. Long line of polite Midwesterners 

confused but unperturbed by the lack of employees 

at a Subway. One guy investigating. Unsuccessful. 

Employee comes out, line starts moving. No audible 

complaints. Might have just seen a unicorn.

Unfortunately, my only conclusion is that people 

from the Midwest, or at least the people in line at 

that Subway, are nicer than me.

5:00 p.m. I spend the better chunk of the rest of my 

time in Wal-Mart sitting on my computer in Subway. 

Sporadically, I remember Hunter and David and feel 

guilty for not taking advantage of my opportunity to 
explore Wal-Mart. I’d get up and go for a stroll that 
would last five to 10 minutes, before I remembered 
that exploring Wal-Mart the same way someone 
explores a national park makes me a really specific 
type of asshole.

8:30 p.m. I caved. I begged my friends to let me 

come home and they obliged. It was snowing a lot and 
nobody was on the road. We listened to Soulection 
and almost skidded off the road and it’s very, very 
quiet at night in Saline in the snow and that was 
profound. I typed up my notes and wrote this piece, 
which, for better or for worse, might make me that 
really specific type of asshole.

Muslim Students’ Association Carves its Place on Campus

Wednesday, February 8, 2017 // The Statement

Wednesday, February 8, 2017 // The Statement 
5B

T

here is no mosque or designated 
prayer room. A reminder must 
be sent out each week specify-

ing when and where to meet on Fridays 
so that the prayers can be held. Efforts 
have been made, I’m told, to secure a 
stable location, but to no avail. Jumuah 
— the mandatory ritual prescribed by the 
faith — on the University of Michigan’s 
campus is an unknown quantity.

I’ve been a handful of times — more 

than five, probably less than 10. I know 
this isn’t what my parents want to hear. 
I am still a practicing Muslim, a product 
of exasperating weekly Sunday school 
and interminable Qur’an reading les-
sons. The faith is ingrained in me, even 
if I’m not particularly devout. Save for a 
blatantly Arabic first name, I am not out-
wardly Muslim, nor do I go out of my way 
to identify as such. Rather, it’s an internal 
flame.

Shame throbbing in my mind, I sit on 

the floor of the Anderson Room in the 
Michigan Union for the Muslim Stu-
dents’ Association’s — the largest Mus-
lim student organization on campus 
— weekly jumuah, cross-legged, my left 
foot gradually falling asleep, listening 
to the imam. He is the Chaplain, Shaykh 
Mohammed Ishtiaq, and he’s a jolly, fully 
bearded man, like a dark-skinned Eric 
Wareheim. The ceiling is higher than 
most actual mosques I’ve been in, and the 
guys around me are impressively invest-
ed in the sermon. Unlike my childhood 
memories of jumuah, there are no whis-
pered conversations about basketball 
or the conspicuous phone usage under-
neath crossed legs; the brothers are rapt. 
Far behind me and separated by a wide 
chasm of carpet, the sisters sit, identical.

In this post-election climate, the role 

of the Muslim student activist is in flux. 
There is an urgent immediacy to, well, do 
something. A few days after the election, 
the Islamic Center of Ann Arbor received 
an anonymous letter proclaiming that 

our then President-elect will “do to you 
Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews.” 
Earlier this week, the prayer rugs in a 
reflection room in the Union were found 
desecrated by urine. And in the past two 
weeks, President Donald Trump enacted 
a ban on refugees, citizens, green-card 
holders, and more from seven Muslim-
majority countries — it is, for all intents 
and purposes, a ban on Muslims.

Estimated at about 150 active mem-

bers, the MSA functions primarily as 
a social group for its patrons, but in 
the past few months, its hand has been 
almost forced: activism and outreach is 
now a necessity. To be sure, the feeling of 
hostility is not a newfound development: 
hate crimes against American Muslims 
rose by 78 percent in 2015, the most 
since 9/11. This environment is not some 
abrupt occurrence, but instead a gradual 
reality that has been gestating for quite 
some time.

Ashamed of my own reluctance to 

participate in activism, I began to recon-
sider my relationship with my identity. I 
wondered about my own insecurities and 
considered the possible identity crisis of 
the MSA, the struggle between function-
ing as a social group and a space of activ-
ism and outreach. 

Where, then, does the MSA situate 

itself on campus? Is it as a space for soli-
darity among Muslims, or a vehicle for 
more evocative activism? What is the 
current state of Muslim student leader-
ship in the face of a politically legitimized 
hatred and bigotry? For people like me 
— people who have, for some reason or 
another, shunned an integral part of 
their identity — these questions present a 
more pressing issue: the identity politics 
of activism, both public and personal.

In its current iteration, the MSA is 

structured like a genealogy tree of sorts. 
At its head sits the president, a member of 
its seven-person executive board. These 
are the ones who make group decisions, 

plan initiatives, and represent the orga-
nization. Each board member is assigned 
two “directors,” who manage day-to-day 
operations. The directors, too, are sub-
tended by lesser organization members, 
and so on.

The weekly operations of MSA are 

fairly standardized. On Monday nights, 
the group holds a small event called 
“Mini-Qiyam.” A qiyam is a student-led 
lecture that ranges from religious educa-
tion to application. Tuesday nights hosts 
a monthly “Sisters’ Book Club.” MSA 
meetings are on Wednesday nights, in 
which the board discuss make organi-
zational decisions. Thursday nights are 
weekly lectures from guests or the Chap-
lains, and Friday afternoons are jumuah 
prayers. Informal socials happen fre-
quently.

Mohammad Shaikh, a business sopho-

more and member of the board, says he 
joined the MSA for a sense of community. 
He’s a good-looking, articulate kid from 
Ann Arbor and Jackson, Michigan.

I can’t help but ask: how has this easy 

structure been disrupted — if at all — by 
the election and the subsequent events?

Shaikh admits that, while day-to-day 

operations haven’t changed, the MSA has 
recently revved up its focus on initiatives 
and outreach. Less than a week after 
the election, the MSA hosted an out-
door prayer on the Diag, planned as an 
impromptu act of solidarity for the Mus-
lim women who were allegedly attacked 
and harassed earlier that week. More 
than 200 students and faculty members 
across campus. Non-Muslim attend-
ees formed a symbolic ring of protec-
tion around the Muslim attendees, who 
prayed Isha, the final daily prayer, on the 
grass in front of the campus’ American 
flag. I look down as he mentions the num-
ber of non-Muslim students who attend-
ed, hoping he won’t ask if I was there.

“We were very happy and pleasantly 

surprised by how many people showed 

up,” Shaikh said. “We did not think it was 
going to blow up that much. From the 
MSA side, we felt very blessed.”

Other recent initiatives include Wol-

verine Guard, a buddy system meant to 
aid people who are uncomfortable walk-
ing home at night. 

An internally controversial develop-

ment began as another well-intentioned 
act of solidarity. A female MSA member 
from Wayne State University suggested 
to board members a “Kufis in Solidar-
ity” movement. Kufis are small hats that 
Muslim men often wear to the mosque 
(similar to a yarmulke), and in a show of 
support, men would wear them to stand 
with women who wore the hijab. 

But among MSA — particularly within 

the sisters — this idea wasn’t received 
warmly. Many claimed this was either 
unsustainable, or simply tokenism; men 
had the luxury of doing this for a week 
or two, while hjiabi women carried this 
burden for life.

Mariam Doudi, a Business sophomore 

and MSA director, was indifferent. She’s 
short and wears a hijab.

Within the MSA sisters’ group chat, 

there was a considerable amount of back-
lash according to Doudi. Along with the 
men wearing kufis in solidarity, there 
was a parallel idea being floated of non-
hijab-wearing sisters also donning the 
headscarf for some time. This sugges-
tion, Doudi says, was possibly even more 
inflammatory.

“I feel like it was sweet, but I don’t 

know how effective it would have been,” 
Doudi says. “You’re not really going to 
feel how we feel if you wear it for like a 
week or whatever. In the end, we’re still 
going to be a minority again.”

In the wake of attacks on “visibly Mus-

lim” people, the idea of others being able 
to categorize them as such on first sight 
— caused consternation in the MSA.

For former MSA member Mishaal 

Khan, the burden of the hijab is one 

of always having to “be on;” it’s a 
stripped-down, granular version of 
respectability politics, and represent-
ing the entirety of one’s faith is a tire-
some weight.

“If I mess up, it’s not going to be, ‘Oh, 

that girl messed up,’” she says. “It’s 
going to be, ‘Oh, that Muslim messed 
up.’”

On a cold evening, I find myself 

once again in the embrace of Allah. 
Each Thursday, the MSA holds weekly 
halaqa, talks or meetings meant to dis-
cuss aspects of the faith that pertain 
to campus life. I hadn’t been to one in 
years. I pass a Bible reading group in 
the room next door on the way in.

The room, filled with rows of chairs, 

is sparsely populated: one forlorn-look-
ing guy in a beard and a beanie scroll-
ing through his phone, and six or seven 
women chatting in the front row. I take 
a seat in the back, alone, and pull out 
my notebook.

“Assalamu-Alaikum, man. Humza.” 

I look up to see the kid in the beanie 
extending his hand in the standard 
Islamic greeting. I respond instinc-
tively.

“Walaikum-Assalam. Nabeel,” I say, 

smiling and shaking his hand.

“Mind if I sit next to you? Not many 

other guys here.”

“No, of course, go for it.”
He sits down next to me, and I 

become aware, not for the last time, 
of the barely perceptible disconnect 
between men and women in this room.

More people file in and I’m still one 

of the few guys, while many girls in 
hijab, some not, keep filling out the 
rows. Once the speaker arrives and is 
introduced, I realize there might be a 
reason.

Melanie Elturk is the CEO of Haute 

Hijab, the country’s largest ven-
dor of fashionable hijabs and clothes 
designed for Muslim women. She 
delivers today’s talk: “The Next Gen-
eration of American Muslims: Defining 
Our Role and Reclaiming Our Faith.” 
A Midwestern native, she was a for-
mer civil rights lawyer in both Chicago 
and Dubai before building the compa-
ny with her husband. She’s energetic, 
bright and exceedingly well-spoken, 
with a disarmingly cheerful smile. Her 
head is, of course, covered.

“Our parents, we owe them a great 

deal of credit,” she says. “It’s some-
thing fantastic that we, as their chil-
dren, in this generation, are now taking 
the torch from them. We’re in this 
beautifully set-up circumstance where 
we can compound on the foundation 
they’ve laid for us.”

I find this an odd place to begin. 

Indeed, for the rest of the halaqa, 
Elturk repeatedly references her father 
and family relationships. I get the sense 
that the brand of Muslim activism she’s 

prescribing is one that’s still tethered 
to an overtone of traditionalism.

I take a break to survey the room. 

In front of me is a kid registering for 
courses on his laptop. To my left, I 
can’t help but notice Humza Shaukat 
frantically sending out WhatsApp mes-
sages asking fellow brothers to show 
up. Each carefully worded text begins 
with a courteous “Salam.”

On the other side of the room, where 

the chairs are separated by a row of 
space in the middle, the sisters in hijab 
are rapt. Their faces are adorned with 
visible admiration and respect: the 
dearth of hjiabi role models. I hear 
Elturk ask the crowd, “You need to ask 
yourself: what can I contribute to soci-
ety — in order to make it better, in order 
to change it for the better, and bring 
the light and the beauty of our faith 
into this society?”

Elturk’s speech is peppered with 

Arabic phrases and snippets of the 
Qur’an. (I suffer the occasional PTSD-
flashback to my Sunday school night-
mares each time I hear it.) Her talk 
ranges from the trials and tribulations 
of scarf design to pleas for increased 
Muslim representation in creative 
fields, to the particulars of finding a 
spouse. “This is the age when you’re 
going to find the person you marry.” 
If my mom didn’t hold that same ludi-
crous notion, I would have laughed out 
loud.

When Elturk opens the floor for 

questions, I observe the nagging issues 
plaguing the MSA members. One girl 
gets right to the obvious question: In 
the context of feminist discourse, how 
do we respond to people who say ask 
if the hijab is reinforcing patriarchal 
standards?

“Just know that our deen [faith] is an 

asset, not a burden,” Elturk answers. 
“You should never apologize for it, and 
take ownership of your hijab.”

She recounts a college anecdote of 

walking to class: there are two guys 
catcalling every woman passing by, 
but they abruptly fall silent as she 
walks past. She says this was a sign of 
empowerment, that these boys real-
ized from her hijab she was a person of 
faith. I recognize the conviction of her 
story, and, more importantly, she — as 
do all women — know more than I.

While the girls ask questions regard-

ing faith and social activism, the guys 
that raise their hands seem interested 
more in Elturk’s business. Elturk was 
not didactic, like the Islamic lectures 
of my youth or the sermons at Friday 
jumuah, but more conversational. Her 
message is one of liberation through 
both Islam and American entrepre-
neurship — two concepts so often per-
ceived as societally incompatible. 

As I put my jacket on to leave, Elturk 

is talking to a group of sisters. I am sit-

uated in an odd place. Here is a commu-
nity that is not mine, one that I actively 
rejected, but is nonetheless one I’m sup-
posed to be a part of. Once I step outside 
of the League, into the frigid air and light 
snow, I will have returned and retreat-
ed, to the comfort of basketball and The 
Michigan Daily and meat that isn’t halal 
and my “real” friends. I am both an out-
sider and member, strangely connected to 
and longing for this world I’m supposed 
to be part of.

Tina Al-khersan, an LSA senior, is not a 

hjiabi and no longer an MSA board mem-
ber. She is, however, Muslim, and her per-
sonal brand of activism has now extended 
beyond the MSA. She now serves on the 
LSA Campus Climate Committee and 
is an Executive Board member for the 
Michigan Refugee Assistance Program.

Al-khersan is well-versed in activism 

outside of the MSA. Growing up in North-
ville, Michigan, she says she wasn’t proud 
of her identity and fought to hide it from 
others. In addition to joining MSA her 
freshman year, she also became a member 
of Muslims and Jews, an interfaith group 
between Muslims and Jews on campus.

“You don’t necessarily have to be part of 

a ‘Muslim’ organization or ‘activist’ orga-
nization to be a Muslim activist,” she says. 
“Some of my proudest moments being a 
‘Muslim activist’ have been talking about 
my faith one-on-one with friends or even 
strangers. To me, the best type of educa-
tion occurs when we open up and talk 
about what our faith means to us.”

Activism is not in the foundational 

DNA of the MSA. It has historically been 
a social organization, and only recently 
have advocacy and outreach reemerged 
as an integral part of its mission.

For some, Islam itself provides a moral 

foundation and path toward social jus-
tice. Shaikh and Al-khersan both say the 

Prophet Muhammad was the world’s 
greatest social activist, and the Qur’an 
itself calls for standing up to injustice.

As with all groups, there are the draw-

backs of social pressures and envies. 
Shaikh admits the MSA has a history of 
members looking down on those who may 
be less observant, or being unforgiving to 
religious missteps. It’s one of the reasons 
people are hesitant to join, Shaikh says, 
and that’s something I can attest to.

But the election has galvanized the 

organization. The members are unified in 
their desires to support Muslim women, 
both hijabi and not, and want to destig-
matize their faith as an un-American 
“other.” When you begin to tell people 
that not all Muslims are terrorists, you 
run the risk of becoming a cliché. This 
isn’t the most complex line of analysis, 
and it’s been a thudding, repeated refrain 
in any Muslim’s life, to the point of genu-
ine irritation. But it’s necessary. 

I find myself questioning the point of 

it all. My natural reflex to casual bigotry 
is self-deprecation and sarcasm. I tend to 
make a joke out of everything. I’d like to 
ask them: What’s the point of becoming 
a student activist when activism is sim-
ply a social yoke? When you’re already 
an “other,” when you’re already the per-
son who’s always described in the sec-
ondhand as “some [insert ethnicity here] 
guy,” when, in the eyes of the majority, 
your identity has already been whittled 
down from a complex, dynamic entity to 
the checkbox on an employment applica-
tion — aren’t you just playing into their 
hands?

I can’t count the number of times I’ve 

run through this in my head — especial-
ly at college, where everything is pro-
nounced, heightened, politicized. I’ve 
always come down (smugly) on the side 
of the identity organization holdout (read:

myself), that the true rebellion, rath-

er, is in forcing them to accept you. They 
want you to join the Indian American 
Students Association, I tell myself; of 
course he’s part of the Muslim Student 
Association, they’ll say about me.

Of course now I’m second-guessing 

myself.

I make the journey to North Quad 

on a Sunday, when the MSA is hosting 
a brunch for people to “de-stress” and 
I figure this would be a useful exercise 
in familiarization: I haven’t seen the 
MSA function in a strictly social setting 
yet. Unfortunately, it’s a goddamn bliz-
zard out there, and as I trudge through 
blistering winds my hair is ruined and 
I begin to worry about how I’m going 
to appear, I feel a burgeoning sense of 
regret.

But once I’m there I begin to feel a 

sense of comfort. I greet a friend from 
the newspaper upon arrival and accept 
ed a generous plate of food and coffee 
upon arrival. 

Within the looming modernity of 

North Quad, at the top floor of its tall-
est tower, sits the Bowman Room (nick-
named the “Tower Room”). It’s a large 
yet cozy space, complete with a small 
kitchen, a working piano, and an assort-
ment of plush furniture. 

There’s a considerable turnout, prob-

ably because of the free brunch. The sis-
ters are setting up the table full of food 
as the brothers pack themselves into 
the kitchen and cook. It’s a spread of 

pancakes, scrambled eggs, donuts, and 
other assorted treats — I spot a plate 
stacked with za’atar-filled pita bread, 
so I can safely report to my parents that 
our friends at the MSA have not entire-
ly lost their roots. My friend from the 
Daily is painstakingly setting up a “hot 
chocolate station,” replete with candy 
canes and whipped cream. The guys in 
the kitchen shout Future lyrics while 
weirdly specific Arabic music plays 
from some kid’s speakers. They look like 
they’re having fun.

I’m introduced to Mazen Oweiss. 

He’s a director, a junior like me, and 
this year he’s become significantly more 
involved in the MSA. He’s also of Egyp-
tian background, and he has a distinctly 
Egyptian-American way of speaking — 
along with a quintessentially Egyptian 
thicket of dense, curly hair — that viv-
idly evokes the kids I grew up with, the 
friends I used to spend my weekends 
cutting Sunday school with to go to 
Walgreens, the people whom I have all 
but lost my once-robust connection to.

Mazen and I talk for a while as a 

steady stream of MSA members file in 
and I’m introduced to each one with a 
hearty “Assalam-u-Alaikum” and shake 
hands. As we sit among the brothers on 
couches, and the sisters mill about the 
table of food, Mazen talks about how 
this year’s cohort of the MSA is much 
closer, increasingly relaxed and heart-
eningly unified.

My sister, who was an active mem-

ber of her university’s MSA, always told 
me about the troubles that plagued her 
organization: religious condescension, 
jealousy, pettiness, people actually getting 
married, and other hurdles that prevented 
the group from getting things done. But as 
I’ve learned — and as Mazen points out — 
this MSA has accomplished a lot. They’ve 
done countless outreach programs, hosted 
successful events, and fully embraced 
their role as campus activists. Their big-
gest issue now continuing the trend into 
next year.

I’m surprised at how forthcoming 

Mazen is; he knows I’m here to write a 
story, and that I’m not really a part of 
MSA. But at this point, I’m a bit confused, 
too: What am I doing here? I’m an outsid-
er: A journalist and on top of that a Mus-
lim who isn’t in the MSA. At some point 
during this whole endeavor, they looked 
past that double whammy of alien remove, 
and let me in.

The food is a welcome treat, the atmo-

sphere is warm, the people are friendly. 
But I’m shook. As I have done for years, as I 
always do, I tell them I have to get going (I 
don’t). I quickly throw on my jacket while 
Mazen tells me to come out more often, 
while another kid smiles at me, while the 
rest of this organization is enjoying the 
company of each other’s presence. I see 
them in their social setting, and I realize, 
then, how difficult the past month must 
have been. For the sisters, for Muslims, for 
anyone feeling without a community — I 
understand, finally, the burden that has 

been placed on these people who didn’t 
ask for it. It is not the politics of activism 
I’m searching for, and I guess it never was.

I grab my stuff and head out the door, 

but not before my old friend Humza grabs 
me by the arm and asks for my number. I 
hesitate, imagining the nightmare barrage 
of texts I’m bound to receive (“Salaam 
brother! We’re all going to fast today just 
for fun, care to join us?”; “Salaam broth-
er! The brothers and I are going to Pin-
ball Pete’s tonight. You should come!”; 
“Salaam brother! Why weren’t you at 
jumuah today?”)

But then, the word jihad crosses my 

mind. I had been taught, years ago on a 
Sunday, that this word does not mean 
what the news tells us it means, that it is 
a term not to be co-opted by the terror-
ists who seek to ruin us, that we all have 
our personal jihad: it means “struggle.” I 
see a family, proud and brave, boarding 
a plane to seek refuge. I see the physical 
manifestation of bigotry and hatred, a 
padlocked gate at the entry of acceptance, 
forcing them back. I see love, acceptance, 
humanity and a profound, aching empa-
thy denied their chances to shine; instead, 
I see a people humiliated in the streets 
they had hoped would accept them with 
open arms. I see, now, why those before us 
struggled, why we must struggle — and, if 
only I struggled — why those to come may 
not have to.

I grab Humza’s phone and tap “Create 

Contact.”

What if I told you that, for one day, I was able to 

turn back the clock and be a 10-year-old kid again. 
That for a few hours, I was able to take a break from 
a world that increasingly felt like it was becoming too 
much to handle.

The spell was cast at the Australian Open final by 

two sorcerers of the highest order: Roger Federer and 
Rafael Nadal. They played under the heat of a summer 
Melbourne sun as I sat bundled in blankets, under a 
Michigan winter sky. Physically, they were as far 
away from me as possible, but never had they been 
closer to my heart.

You know you’re getting old when all of your child-

hood tennis heroes are either retired, or losing to 
kids younger than you. Over the past few years, that’s 
become a reality for Federer and Nadal. Roger seeded 
17 at the beginning of the Australian Open and Rafa 
barely made the top-10, coming in at nine. Both recov-
ering from lengthy injuries, the two weren’t supposed 
to make it this far.

These two men are among the greatest tennis play-

ers of all time. They defined the sport and pushed it to 
new heights, but their time was truly supposed to be 
up. Heck, even the next-generation Novak Djokovic 
and Andy Murray were supposed to be running out of 
time. To see both Federer and Nadal reach the final 
of a grand slam together for the first time in six years 
was highly improbable.

I stayed up to watch each of Federer’s games. They 

started at 3:30 a.m. and would end — at the earliest — 
at 6 a.m. I consumed exuberant amounts of coffee and 
skipped many classes, but watching him turn back 
time to beat three top-10 opponents was worth every 
minute of sleep I sacrificed.

I had an exam three hours after I saw Federer beat 

fellow Swiss no. 4 Stanislas Wawrinka. It was an hour 
and a half long; I was out in 40 minutes. Make of that 
what you will.

On the other side of the bracket, Nadal struggled 

against 19-year-old Alexander “Sascha” Zverev, barely 
outlasting him in five sets. But after that close call, he 
roared through the rest of the bracket, and I, just like 
the crowds in Melbourne, “vamos-ed’ every time he 
won a match, making a “Fedal” final that much more 
realistic.

The first tennis match I ever watched was the 2006 

French Open final, which was coincidentally the first 
Federer-Nadal Grand Slam final. It was June of 2006, 
and I was a 9-year-old enjoying summer break and 
excited to watch “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” (My 
parents introduced it to me that summer, and it was 
the first show I ever binge-watched.) Imagine my dis-
appointment when I walked into my parents’ room to 
find them watching two men hitting a ball back and 
forth while making strange grunting noises.

It was already close to midnight, and I knew I 

wasn’t going to watch any “Fresh Prince,” no matter 
how many times my parents said they’d put it on after 
the match. My complaining got me nowhere, so I fig-
ured I might as well watch.

Nadal was up two sets to one, so naturally I want-

ed him to put the game to bed so a young Will Smith 
could make me laugh. But as much as I wanted that 
to happen, every time Federer hit a one-handed back-
hand or served an ace, I couldn’t help but admire his 
brilliance. By the time he tied the set at 6-6, I wanted 
him to win the tiebreaker and keep the match going. 
This was definitely better than the “Fresh Prince.”

I got my first wish. Nadal won the tiebreak pret-

ty fast, and the game ended. My parents still kicked 
me out of the room, and I didn’t get to watch Uncle 
Phil throw Jazz out of the house either. I was mad at 
my parents, but — in hindsight — it was probably the 
only time they did something because “it was better 
for me.” They introduced me to Roger Federer, Rafa 
Nadal and tennis.

For the next six years I watched Rafa dominate on 

clay and Roger weave his magic on grass. Their clash-
es on the court would put the battle between Perseus 
and the Titans to shame — don’t believe me? Just 
watch Wimbledon 2008. I always wanted Federer to 
win. Nadal beat him more often than not.

Before long, though, Federer entered the twilight of 

his career, and injuries threatened to deny Nadal the 
rest of his. The two entered tournament after tourna-
ment only to fall short well before they were meant 
to. Every subsequent defeat would become that much 
less disappointing, that much less shocking. They 
were considered legendary relics of the sport more so 
than actual contenders for the throne.

Not even in my wildest dreams could both men 

have reached a final this year, so when they finally 
did, emotions I hadn’t felt since I was 15 suddenly 
came back to me. These emotions brought with them 
memories of what were some of my fondest years.

A lot has changed since 2011, though. I put on a 

couple of pounds, grew a few inches and a beard now 
sits on my once bare face. I moved half-way around 
the world to attend college, too. Federer and Nadal 
weren’t immune to the effects of time either.

Back then, Nadal was bare biceps, long hair, long 

pants. Now, his hair is thinner, his sleeves have grown 
out, and his shorts are, well, short. But what about 
Federer? He was once graceful elegance and fluid 
perfection, and now, well, he’s still just that — maybe 
just a tad bit slower.

So when the final arrived, it had an eerie unfamil-

iarity around it — it was the ninth time the two were 
meeting in a Grand Slam final, but it had been so long 
that it felt new again. Like the return of a long-lost 
friend you thought you’d never see again.

The story wrote itself. With the match tied at two 

sets a piece, Nadal broke Federer’s first serve and took 
a 3-1 lead. Roger waived his racket like the wand that 
it is and turned the clock back farther than he’d ever 
done. He replied with five unanswered points and 
found himself serving for the championship.

During that last set, I jumped around my couch, 

shouting at the TV for every unforced error, and 
holding my hair in awe at every ace. And when Roger 

finally hit that last forehand winner, I couldn’t hold 
back the tears. For those few hours, there was truly 
nothing else in the world that I cared about. I felt like 
I was 9 years old again.

On that day, everyone was a winner, except for 

Rafa. He brought out his shining megawatt smile, 
tossed aside disappointment to showcase humility, 
and paid his victor, rival and friend the most generous 
of compliments. “Roger deserved it a little more than 
me,” he said.

Exuberant after his win, Federer jumped around 

like it was his first Grand Slam. It was his 18th Grand 
Slam title. That’s more than anyone else and four more 
than his closest competitors, Sampras and Nadal.

For all the intensity, competitiveness and historic 

meaning behind their matches, there is no hint of 
spite or malice in their relationship — only whole-
hearted respect, and reverence.

At a time when the world seems full of public 

immaturity and division, the matchup between Roger 
Federer and Rafael Nadal reminded me that it didn’t 
have to be that way.

As Federer made his lap of honor with the Norman 

Brookes Challenge Cup, I was on my feet in my living 
room, in tears, applauding what I had just seen, just 
like everyone else at Rod Laver Arena. The standing 
ovation was meant for Roger, but it was for Rafa too. 
Because we needed both for this extraordinary spec-
tacle.

Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, thank you from the 

bottom of my heart. For all those finals that marked 
my fondest years. For sticking around, even though 
you were past your best. For finding it in you to be the 
best again.
