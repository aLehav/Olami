Pendingapproval bythe Uni-

Center for Afroamerican and

African Studies will be reor-

of Afroamerican and African
Studies.
Founded in 1970, CAAS is
currently an interdisciplin-

communication to the regents,
University Provost Philip Han-

McDonald recommended the
regents approve the reorgani-

zation effective Sept. 1,2011.
"The shift to departmental
status will fortify their under-

graduate studies beyond
their two graduate certificate
programs and facilitate the
recruitment, promotion and
support for a diverse range
of scholars and instructors,"
Hanlon and McDonald wrote.
"It will also serve to improve

internal controls for this grow-

According to the communi-
cation, departmental status is
just one in a series of changes
made to CAAS overthe years. In

Athletes dine in private room

Students eating meals in cam-
pus dining halls often have to
wait inonglines to geta help-
ing of meatloaf or macaroni and
cheese. But some of the Univer-
sity's highest-profile students get
to skip the line all together.
Student-athletes have access
to a private dining hall located
on South Quad Residence Hall's
main floor, according to Dan
Schleh, director of food services
for University Housing Dining
Services.
The private dining room,
which is locatedbehind the regu-
lar dining hall, was first used in
1988 by the School of Business for
executive dining, Schleh said.
But when the School of Busi-
ness renovated the Executive

Residence on East University
Avenue, it incorporated a new
executive dining room into the
building and moved out of South
Quad.
After the School of Business
vacated the room, Schleh said,the
Athletic Department approached
Residential Dining Services to
use it for "training tables" - a
combination of the meals served,
in the general dining halls and
entrees specially requested by
the football program.
The training tables are meant
to meet the nutritional needs
of student-athletes during the
playing season, Schleh said. The
separate dining area and training
tables are also intended to pro-
vide the team and coaches with

a place to socialize beyond the
football field and training facili-
ties, he said.
In addition to the football
team, Schleh said other ath-
letic teams have used the room
for training tables in the past,
including the men's and women's
basketball teams.
Other special events spon-
sored by University Housing take
place in the private dining room
as well. In the summer, athletic
summer camps eat in the dining
room, and this past weekend, the
room was open to students and
their siblings for the University's
Siblings Weekend, according to
Schleh.

Political unrest in Tunisiacsao
causes thousands to flee

Waves of Tunisians
look to a future
in Europe
LAMPEDUSA, Italy (AP) -
A month after massive protests
ousted Tunisia's longtime dic-
tator, waves of Tunisians are
voting with their feet, fleeing
the country's political limbo by
climbing into rickety boats and
sailing across the Mediterranean
to Europe.
More than 5,000 illegal immi-
grants have recently washed up
on Italy's southern islands - an
unintended consequence of the
"people's revolution" that ousted
autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben
Ali and inspired the uprisings in
Egypt and beyond.
European powers cheered
when Tunisia's 74-year-old ruler
fled into exile in Saudi Arabia on
Jan. 14, but the fallout a month

later has tempered their enthusi-
asm. It has also exposed a dilem-
ma for western countries that
allied with repressive leaders in
North Africa seen as bulwarks
against extremism, and now must
build new diplomatic relation-
ships in a still-uncertain political
climate.
Yesterday, the European Union
announced a euro258 million
($347 million) aid package to
Tunisiafromnowuntil 2013,with
euro17 million ($22.9 million) of
that to be delivered immediately.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine
Ashton, visiting Tunisia, said the
funds were a gift, not a loan.
Meanwhile, Tunisia sternly
rejected Italy's offer to send
police there to help tackle waves
of illegal migrants fleeing politi-
cal upheaval, most landing on
the tiny Italian island of Lampe-
dusa - an arid one-town island of
6,000 people.
Lampedusa's Mayor Bernardi-

no Rubeis told AP Television
News that the island's detention
center for migrants had to leave
its doors open since there were
not enough police to guard it.
Rubeis said the migrants were
milling about, some buying food
in shops and not causing any
problems.
"I want to change my life," said
one Tunisian who wore a T-shirt
from Italy's AS Roma football
team and who declined to give his
name, citing his difficult situa-
tion. "We came here because now
it's not safe and there are no jobs
in Tunisia."
Italian Interior Minister
Roberto Maroni - who has
called the migration a "bibli-
cal exodus"- offered police
"contingents, which can patrol
the coasts" as well as boats and
other equipment and urged the
27-nation European Union to hold
a special meeting on immigration
strategy.

Chilean miners deny false
rumors surrounding rescue

New book claims
miners considered
suicide
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - Chil-
eans directly involved in saving 33
trapped miners last year rejected
claims yesterday that the men
seriously considered suicide and
cannibalism, or that a technician
fooled the world by transmitting
previously videotaped scenes to
cover up a potential disaster during
the rescue.
Reinaldo Sepulveda, who
directed the live television feed
that broadcast images of the rescue
around the world, told The Associ-
ated Press that there was never any
attempt to hide what was going on
by repeating parts of the feed, as
Jonathan Franklin alleges in his

book, "33 Men." The book claims
that at one point, a cable was cut by
a rockslide, and previously broad-
cast images were transmitted to
cover it up.
"A billion viewers around the
world were . tricked," Franklin
wrote. Franklin told the AP Mon-
day night that his book attributes
the alleged trick to alow-level tech-
nician.
"This is absolutely false. I can
show you the 38 or 40 hours of
transmission - they were never
cut," Sepulveda told the AP. "I
guarantee that everything was live
and direct....the transmission was
never cut, never."
It is true that at one point early
in the rescue, Chilean engineers
worked furiously to dismantle
a fiber optic cable that they had
plannedto use with the rescue cap-
sule so that the miners could com-

municate during their half-mile
journey to the surface.
The delay wasn't immediately
explained at the time, but rescue
workers later said the communi-
cations system added unnecessary
complexity to the rescue, and that
the miners didn't want it.
Omar Reygadas, one of the res-
cued miners, added another detail
on Monday - he told the AP that
a rock slide had cut the fiber optic
cable just before he was pulled out
- and that this is why his entrance
to the capsule wasn't filmed.
Reygadas also denied in an AP
telephone interview that any of
the miners had considered suicide
or cannibalism while stuck down
below - dismissing both ideas as
examples of Chilean dark humor
- which is particularly apparentin
extreme situations - that shouldn't
have been taken seriously.

Citizens, in Iran,
Bahrain, Yemen
take to the streets
DUBAI, United Arab Emir-
ates (AP) - The possible heirs
of Egypt's uprising took to the
streets yesterday in different cor-
ners of the Middle East: Iran's
beleaguered opposition stormed
back to central Tehran and came
under a tear gas attack by police.
Demonstrators faced rubber bul-
lets and birdshot to demand more
freedoms in the relative wealth of
Bahrain. And protesters pressed
for the ouster of the ruler in pov-
erty-drained Yemen.
The protests - all with criti-
cal interests for Washington -
offer an important lesson about
how groups across Middle East
are absorbing the message from
Cairo and tailoring it to their own
aspirations.
The heady themes of democ-
racy, justice and empowerment
remain intact as the protest wave
works it way through the Arab
world and beyond. What changes,
however, are the objectives. The
Egypt effect, it seems, is elastic.
"This isn't a one-size-fits-
all thing," said Mustafa Alani,
a regional analyst at the Gulf
Research Center in Dubai. "Each

place will interpret the fallout
from Egypt in their own way and
in their own context."
For the Iranian opposition -
not seen on the streets in more
than a year - it's become a
moment to reassert its presence
after facing relentless pressures.
Tens of thousands of protest-
ers clashed with security forces
along some of Tehran's main bou-
levards, which were shrouded in
clouds of tear gas in scenes that
recalled the chaos after the dis-
puted re-election of President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June
2009. A pro-government news
agency reported one bystander
killed bygunfire.
"Death to the dictator," many
yelled in reference to Ahma-
dinejad. Others took aim Iran's
all-powerful Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei with
chants linking him with toppled
rulers Hosni Mubarak in Egypt
and Tunisia's Zine Al Abidine
Ben Ali.
"Bin Ali, Mubarak, it's Seyed
Ali's turn," protesters cried.
The reformist website kaleme.
com said police stationed sev-
eral cars in front of the home of
opposition leader Mir Hossein
Mousavi ahead of the demonstra-
tion. Mousavi and fellow opposi-
tion leader Mahdi Karroubi have
been under house arrest since last

week after they asked the gov-
ernment for permission to hold a
rally in support of Egypt's upris-
ing - which Iran's leaders have
claimed was a modern-dayreplay
of their 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Karroubi and Mousavi, how-
ever, have compared the unrest
in Egypt and Tunisia with their
own struggles. Mousavi said all
region's revolts aimed at ending
the "oppression of the rulers."
A new U.S. State Department
Twitter account in Farsi took a
jab at Iran in one of its first mes-
sages Sunday, calling on Tehran
to "allow people to enjoy same
universal rights to peacefully
assemble, demonstrate as in
Cairo."
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton expressed sup-
port for the Iranian protesters,
saying they "deserve to have the
same rights that they saw being
played out in Egypt and are part
of their own birthright."
In Yemen, meanwhile, the pro-
tests are about speeding the oust-
er of the U.S.-allied president, Ali
Abdullah Saleh, who has prom-
ised he would step down in 2013.
Yesterday's protests mirrored
the calls in Egypt and Tunisia
against the leadersthere who had
been in power for decades: "The
people want the regime to step
down."

Obama requests
$300M for Great
Lakes restoration
A Great Lakes environmental
fix-up is on shaky ground as Pres-
ident Barack Obama continues
scaling back spending proposals
and congressional Republicans
push for even deeper cuts, sup-
porters said yesterday.
For the second consecutive
year, Obama is seeking less for
the Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative than the $475 million
Congress approved at his request
for 2010. He asked for $300 mil-
lion for the current fiscal year,
a total that remains in doubt as
lawmakers continue wrangling
over the 2011 budget.
His 2012 spending plan
released yesterday calls for
$350 million. But with an asser-
tive Republican majority in the
House pushing to slash domestic
programs, backers of the Great
Lakes plan acknowledge tough
odds.

The Sept. 11 memorial will
open in the World Trade Cen-

for years afterward access will
be limited to a set number of
people and mourners will be sur-

of construction, the memorial
foundation president said yes-
terday.
It will be years before the
millions of people who want to
visit the center have unfettered
access to the memorial site, said
Joe Daniels, president of the
National September 11 Memo-
rial & Museum. Ultimately, visi-
tors will be able to approach the
memorial and its green spaces-
and cobblestoned plazas from all
sides: BuT foryears visit6rs will
be surrounded by construction
of skyscrapers and a transit hub
and may only use one entrance;
organizers will observe strict
capacity limits for safety rea-
sons, Daniels said.
Prelthinary plans call for a
limit of 1,500 visitors at a time.

QUITO, Ecuador
Chevron to pay
* $8.6B for oil
drilling cleanup
An Ecuadorean judge ruled
yesterday in an epic environ-
mental case that Chevron Corp.
was responsible for oil drilling
contamination in a wide swath
of Ecuador's northern jungle and
ordered the oil giant to pay $8.6
billion in damages and cleanup
costs.
The amount was far below the
$27.3 billion recommended by a
court-appointed expert.
But whether the plaintiffs
- including indigenous groups
who say their hunting and fish-

HIGHER ED
From Page 1
from the previous year.
State Rep. Chuck Moss (R-
Birmingham), who chairs the
House Appropriations Commit-
tee, said he predicts all state
expenditures, including higher
education, will face budget cuts.
As a result, universities might
need to change their current
structures.
"(State universities are) going
to have to do what everybody
else does - deliver their services
faster, better and cheaper," Moss
said.

Though Moss said he expects
universities will have to tighten
their belts, he said higher educa-
tion is "extremely important" to
the state.
Moss also said he expects Sny-
der's 2012 fiscal year budget pro-
posal to focus on new tax plans.
"You're also going to see
(Snyder's) tax proposal, which
is probably going to eliminate
a lot of tax credits," Moss said.
"It's going to balance the budget
without raising taxes."
State Rep. Joan Bauer (D-
Lansing), the Democratic vice
chair of the House Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Higher
Education, said that while most

of her colleagues are expecting
cuts, no one can really predict
what's going to be in Snyder's
proposal.
"We don't know exactly what
the governor is going to do,"
Bauer said. "I think we all are
anticipating some very major
cuts."
However, Bauer said appro-
priations to higher education
-will likely be reduced.
"I think (the cut) will be sig-
nificant," she said. "And by sig-
nificant, I guess what I mean (is)
anything beyond 5 percent."
The decrease in higher educa-
tion funding is troubling, Bauer
said, as it will likely have an

effect on costs for students.
"I think we should be pri-
oritizing higher education," she
said. "I mean they've already
been cutting and cutting, but
then my fear is that tuition will
sky rocket."
State Sen. Rebekah Warren
(D-Ann Arbor) said budget cuts
to higher education in recent
years have placed a greater bur-
den on students and families in
their ability to afford a college
education.
"Over the years, our support
to (universities) has continu-
ally diminished, and what we've
seen, as the state investment has
decreased, the amount of money

it takes from our students and
parents in terms of tuition and
fees has really gone up," she said.
Warren said she is worried
about possible budget cuts fact-
ing higher education, especially
considering the growing role
state universities and colleges
play in revitalizing Michigan's
economy.
"I think higher education is
one of the most critical factors
in Michigan's.economic recov-
ery," Warren said. "I don't see
any path to a strong and vibrant
economy for Michigan's future
without well-funded public edu-
cation, particularly higher edu-
cation."

2000, according to the commu-

global and interdisciplinary
way.
"Through this series of cur-

successful record of hiring,

the late 1990s, CAAS now has in
place a strong group of commit-

CONSTRUCTION
APPROVAL EXPECTED
FOR ALICE LLOYD
At their meeting Thursday,
the regents are expected to
approve the issuing of bids for
renovations of Alice Lloyd Resi-
dence Hall.
The $56 million project will
consist of changes to student
rooms and restrooms, new com-
munity areas and an array of
upgrades to the building's infra-
structure. The renovations will
start after this semester and will
end by fall 2012.
The schematics of the project

were approved unanimously at
the University Board of Regents
meeting in December. At the
meeting, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said she sup-
ports the renovations.
"I think it has a much clean-
er look, actually, a much more
coherent look," Coleman said.
"It'll be very nice."
BOARD TO CONSIDER
$3.85MILLION IN
BUILDING RENOVATIONS
The regents will also ponder
renovations to several geologi-
cal science laboratories in the
Clarence Cook Little Science
Building and to the atrium of the

School of Social Work building.
In a communication to the
regents, Timothy Slottow, the
University's executive vice pres-
ident and chief financial officer,
wrote that the renovations to
C.C. Little will include electri-
cal, mechanical and architec-
tural improvements to about
10,600 square feet of laboratory
space on the fourth floor of the
building.
Theprojectisestimatedtocost
about $2 million and is scheduled
to be completed this fall.
Additionally, the renovations
to the School of Social Work
building are slated to cost $1.85
million, according to another
communication to the regents

from Slottow.
Slottow wrote in the commu-
nication that the construction
will reallocate 18,400 square
feet of the building's first floor
atrium into clinical space.
"(The new space will) allow
students to practice and observe
clinical approaches, accom-
modate expanded continuing
education programs and pro-
vide updated spaces for student
interaction," Slottow wrote.
The atrium was formerly
home to the School of Social
Work's collection of books, but
the library was moved into the
School of Public Health Library
and the Hatcher Graduate
Library.

especially when using the tech-
nology that will be provided.
"We really kind of see it as
a place that's going to promote
pure learning and interaction,"
Alexander said. "So we're going
to have all sorts of furniture and
large display screens."
The space will also be used as
a venue for University events and
student group functions, such as
poetry readings by students and
various speakers and workshops,
Alexander said.
Funding for the Bert's Cafe
Study Lounge came from Univer-
sity alum BertramAskwith, a 1931
LSAgraduate. Alexanderwrote in
an e-mail interview that Askwith
has been supportive of the Uni-

versity ever since he founded his
company, Campus Coach Lines,
as an undergraduate.
"He is very much focused on
undergraduates and how he can
help their learning experience,"
Alexander said.
The idea for the lounge was
developed last year, Alexander
said, after she conducted several
focus groups asking students
what changes they would like to
see in the library.
"We heard over and over again
that students wanted more places
to sit, they wanted flexible furni-
ture, they wanted the ability to
work in groups, to plug in their
laptop and work collaboratively,"
she said. "They wanted a place to
showcase their course work on
large displays - all those things
that you work on all semester
long."
Students also expressed a


YOGA

"HealthyBacksYoga" and "Pre-
natal/Postnatal Yoga."
"I've been in my position for
a year and a half now, and they
are one of the most popular
classes, so I'm trying to get as
many on the schedule as I can,"
she said.
In order to accommodate for
the high demand, the U-Move
yoga classes are offered at stag-
gered times to provide for as
many people as possible, Cal-
houn said.
"We've got classes in the
early morning at 7 a.m., lunch
classes for people who can
sneak away, and classes after
the work hour for people who
may want to end their day with
a little bit of relaxation," she
said.
Yoga studios near campus
are also looking to suit stu-
dents' varying schedules, with
some offering classes start-
ing as early as 6 a.m. and some
ending as late as 10 p.m. In
addition to the array of times,
the studios offer a range of
yoga styles to provide custom-
ers with different workouts
and experiences.
Ann Arbor School of Yoga on

West Huron Street offers medi-
tative breathing yoga and yoga
for beginners, while Center
for Yoga - which has two Ann
Arbor locations on East Wil-
liam Street and West Stadium
Boulevard - focuses on Hot
Vinyasa and Slow Burn yoga.
Another studio close to cam-
pus, Ann Arbor Bikram Yoga on
Washtenaw Avenue, specializes
in Bikram Yoga, which is also
conducted in a room with high
heat.
Jonny Kest, founder of the
Center for Yoga, said there has
been a great amount of inter-
est in classes lately. Center for
Yoga's East William Street loca-
tion is the company's fourth
studio in Michigan and opened
in September.
"The popularity is definitely
evident, "Kest said. "We were
really surprised by the turnout.
Since January it's been on fire,
and I don't think we've had a
class under 20 people in the
evening."
Kest, also a University alum,
said he thinks the popularity of
Center for Yoga's classes is due
to students hearing about them
through word of mouth.
"As soon as people heard
about (our classes) and started
coming, people started Face-
booking and coming in groups,"

desire to have a place in the
undergraduate library to hear
and see international news and
events. Alexander said the library
will meet this need by providing
a "series of international news
feeds coming in."
Alexander said the ongoing
construction hasn't affected stu-
dents' use of the library.
"At first there were a few
annoyances, like you had to learn
how to use a different stairwell,"
she said. "But overall, once the
students found out what the new
space was goingto be and that we
were doing it in response to their
requests, we received alot of pos-
itive feedback about it."
Alexander added that the
construction - which takes
place between the hours of 7
a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays
- isn't a distraction for stu-
dents and doesn't substantially
he said. "We've done very little-
to-no advertising."
Business School senior Alex
Rich was one of these students
who heard about a Center for
Yoga class from one of his
friends and decided to try it.
"I've been going to the gym
since I was 15, and I've never
had a more productive hour
of exercise," Rich said. "I feel
like you get to do cardio and
strength all in one. I've also
been having some flexibility
issues, so this helps."
While Rich started tak-
ing yoga classes recently, LSA
freshman Katharine Kovan
said she has been practicing
yoga prior to coming to the Uni-
versity.
"I did yoga almost every day
over the summer, so I definitely
wanted to continue with it,"
Kovan said. "I really like yoga
because it's a combination of
relaxation and exercise. You're
still getting your workout, but
the whole premise is turning
inward and taking a step back
from the outside world and just
relaxing."
Similarly, Kest said yoga is an
effective way to "recharge" and
get "a second wind."
"Yoga is like taking a show-
er," he said. "It kind of washes
away a lot of stress and tension."

increase noise levels.
"The undergraduate library ...
is loud," Alexander said. "Con-
struction of the lounge was most-
ly done in the morning and use of
the library really increases in the
afternoon and evenings."
However, Engineering sopho-
more Melanie Croos-Dabrera
said because of the construction,
she has been avoidingstudying at
the UGLi.
"Sometimes when we have to
schedule study groups, we never
pick the UGLi anymore because
of the construction in the way,"
she said.
Nevertheless, Croos-Dabrera

said she's excited for the study
lounge to open.
"Looking at the plans for it, it
looks really nice', and I think it
will be really beneficial," Croos-
Dabrera said.
Engineering graduate, stu-
dent Chase Estrin said though
navigating the library during
construction has been a minor
inconvenience, he is excited for
the new lounge.
"It will be nice to see what it
looks like when it's done," Estrin
said. "I think that more seating in
the lounge will be good because
there's not very much of it right
now."

Spread the web
Initiative to increase Internet access is essential
surprising number of Americans don't have access to the
Internet. Along with creating universal health care and
repairing the housing market, President Barack Obama wants
to address this problem. The issue has been a real point of emphasis,
gaining mention in both this year's State of the Union address and dur-
ing a trip last Thursday to Marquette, Mich. The United States lags
behind other developed nations when it comes to Internet access, so
it's encouraging that Obama has made it a priority. The administra-
tion should continue to work toward its goal of Internet access for all
Americans so the U.S. can compete in a global economy.

Obama chose to visit Marquette to sell his
idea because the remote city has nearly univer-
sal wireless Internet coverage. He's outlined a
plan to make the web accessible to 98 percent
of the country within five years. The $18 billion
project would create more space for wireless
Internet traffic by auctioning airwaves that
currently belong to government agencies and
television stations to commercial wireless car-
riers. Funds would be used to construct rural
4G networks and mobile communications sys-
tems for emergency responders, according to a
Feb.10 article in The Washington Post. Stimu-
lus money and various federal subsidies will
supplement finances for the program, which
Obama has said is an important part of build-
ing a new infrastructure for the country.
The U.S. can't continue tolagbehind in infra-
structure development, which includes more
than railways, roads and telephones. A recent
government-survey showed that 40 percent,
of Americans don't have access to high-speed
Internet, according to a CNET article. In 2009
the U.S. ranked 28th in download speed, with
speeds only a quarter as fast as first-ranked
SouthKorea. Obama's policyis anecessarystep
toward improving Internet access. A well-for-
mulated national strategy to expand Internet
access is imperative for the U.S. to thrive in a

growing competitive world economy.
Simply put, the Internet is good for business.
Whether it helps entrepreneurs start com-
panies or market their products, web access
provides an unparalleled level of connectivity
with the outside world that's valuable to many
Americans. Neglecting this source of econom-
ic development, especially as the U.S. emerges
from a recession, would prove to be costly in
the long run. Overall, Obama's plan is a smart
investment - not only does it pave the way
for future economic development, but it also
puts $10 billion in additional auction revenues
toward closingthe budget deficit.
But expanding Internet access isn't just a
smart business decision. At a fundamental
level, the web empowers - it facilitates the
proliferation of information and fosters the
exchange of ideas, while also giving students
the tools to succeed. Whether by encouraging
innovation or closing the education gap, the
Internet helps people to achieve their poten-
tial. It's unacceptable that Americans don't
have access to this resource at the same level
as citizens of other developed countries.
Obama's initiative to make the Internet
available throughout the country is essential
to the country's continued improvement and
vitality.

The president of the United
States is a powerful per-
son. He's often called "the
leader of the free
world.' By exten-
sion - since he's
so powerful -
the woman he's
married to also
becomes a very
public figure. But
the responsibili-
ties of the First DAR-WEI
Lady aren't as CHEN
substantial and
definitely not as
comprehensive. Traditionally, all the
First Lady is supposed to do is pur-
sue an issue that matters to her and is
non-controversial. For example, Lady
Bird Johnson believed that beauty
could improve the mental health of a
society, so she started a campaign to
plant more flowers on highways and
to remove junkyards and billboards.
It's almost always a win-win situa-
tion: Some problem that needs fixing
in America gets help in the form of
White House muscle, but without the
political mess.
Our current First Lady, Michelle
Obama, has decided to tackle obe-
sity, with a focus on children. At
first glance, her campaign called
"Let's Move!" looks like a great idea.
Accordingto the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in 2008,19.6
percent of 6 to 11-year-old children
were obese, as well as 18.1 percent
of 12 to 19 year olds. Even more chil-
dren and adolescents are overweight
and -not necessarily obese. Forbes.
com repoted that 74.1 percent of
adults in theUnited States are over-
weight as of 2007. Mrs. Obama's
plan to handle the obesity epidemic
includes encouraging active life-
styles for children starting at an
early age, giving information to

parents on how to promote healthy
choices and making nutritious food
available for students in schools and
to families everywhere. Non-contro-
versial and meaningful. This should
be a home-run, right?
Not so fast, say the Republicans
- as they do with everything an
Obama does. Former Alaska Gover-
nor Sarah Palin said last year that,
"What [Michelle Obamaj is telling us
is she cannot trust parents to make
decisions for their own children, for
their own families in what we should
eat ... instead of a government think-
ing that they need to take over ... just
leave us alone." This quote is funny
for two reasons. First, no government
official is trying to tell anyone how
to live - Obama is merely suggesting
how people can live healthier life-
styles and providing information on
how to doit. How there is controversy
here is beyond me. Second, while she
was governor of Alaska, Palin said
that childhood obesity: "needs to be
addressed at the individual, commu-
nity, state and national levels." The
hypocrisy is staggering.
Let's give Palin the benefit of the
doubt - maybe she's changed her
mind about how to solve America's
obesity problem. If so, she should
have been similarly outraged at for-
mer First Lady Laura Bush's work
in promoting literacy. I can just
imagine Palin getting mad about
"big government intrusion" and
how it's going to force everyone to
read books. She would probably say
something like, "Get government
out of my life. Don't tell me what I
should or shouldn't read, or wheth-
er I or my kids should even be able
to read at all." The problem is that
Laura wasn't being socialist. She was
just recommending that people read
because a literate country is a strong
country. Maybe Palin would have a

skewed perspective on the need for
the government to promote read-
ing, though, because of her reading
prowess. Remember what she said
to Katie Couric about what newspa-
pers she reads? "Um, all of them, any
of them that have been in front of me
over all these years." What a reader.
At first glance,
Obama's program
looks great.
To be fair, some in the GOP have
not embraced Palin's attitude on"Let's
Move!" However, to many people in
the Tea Party, this anti-obesity cam-
paign is exactly the type of govern-
ment intrusion they hate. Just listen
to talk-radio ratings titan Rush Lim-
baugh rail against it weekly (although
he, of all people, could use some
exercise). I think that playing games
with America's health is immoral,
especially since one of the reasons
for skyrocketing health care costs is
obesity-related diseases like diabetes.
But some people don't stop at blaming
Obama for growing the size of gov-
ernment. Matt Drudge, author of the
conservative "Drudge Report," has
pushedastudytryingtolinkObamato
the 0.4 percent-increase in pedestrian
deaths for the first half of 2010. How
are the two related? More people are
walking around to get fit - right into
traffic, apparently.
In summary, Michelle is promot-
ing socialism and killing people.
Although honestly, according to the
Tea Party, all Obama policies do that.

Students don't need to be reminded that tuition costs
have skyrocketed in recent years. But what many don't
know is that, in inflation-adjusted terms, the University
- like many other universities - isn't spending more
money than it used to spend. Increased tuition, rather, is
in large part due to decreased levels of support from the
state government. The state Legislature -'which once
provided the majority of the University's funding - now
provides just 6 percent of the University's annual operat-
ing budget and 22 percent of its general fund, a number
down from 78 percent compared to 50 years ago. Despite
having an elected Board of Regents, the University is now
nominally public.
Considering this decreased funding, it's no wonder
that even with record donations, a skyrocketing endow-
ment and painful budget cuts, the regents have raised
tuition substantially and repeatedly. The lack of state
support has priced higher education out of the reach of
many young people from low and middle-income fami-
lies, which endangers the University's mission of pro-
viding an "uncommon education for the common man."
Legislators often point out that the drastic increase in the
University's endowment has led to increases in financial
aid and that low and middle-income students can still
attend college in what they refer to as a "high tuition,
high aid" model.
Unfortunately, the numbers tell a different story. In
the years 1997-2007, before the affirmative action ban
began to further decrease enrollment among under-
represented groups, the University saw a 10-percent
decrease in students from families with yearly incomes
between $10,000 and $74,000 and an 8-percent increase
in students from families with yearly incomes more than
$200,000. Enrollment of underrepresented minorities-
decreased too: African-American enrollment fell from
8.4 percent to 6.7 percent.
The University's chapter of the College Democrats has
a longstanding tradition of making annual pilgrimages
to Lansing to remind state legislators of their responsi-
bility for higher education. Every time, we're met with
the familiar refrain that in hard economic times, every-
one has to share in the sacrifice. A few months later,
state appropriations for colleges and universities are cut.
Shared sacrifice makes for compelling rhetoric, but just
a little digging shows that it's disconnected from reality.
While education and social services have been gutted,
taxes have fallen precipitously and mass incarceration

- on which the state spends significantly more than it
does on higher education - continues unabated. If leg-
islators were willing to modernize an outdated tax struc-
ture, there would be more than enough money to reliably
fund higher education and balancethe budgetwith taxes
lower - as a percentage of gross state product - than
they were a decade ago.
Back in the late 90s, the state brought in about 9.5
percent of personal income as revenue. Today, it brings
in about 6.9 percent. That drastic decline means that
the state collects $9 billion less in revenue than it would
have done if it was collectingthe same percentage of our
income as it did a decade ago. The cuts aren't only due
to intentional tax cuts, but also because of an outdated
tax code, which - most egregiously - rarely applies the
sales tax to services. The service sector is the largest
and fastest growing segment of the economy, and most
other states recognize this fact. In Michigan, however,
we're trying to support government with the modern day
equivalent of a tax on agricultural goods in the midst of
the industrial revolution.
In the context of the state budget, $9 billion is a signifi-
cant loss especially whenthe total real cuts to higher edu-
cationspendinginthe last decadetotaljustover $1billion
annually. The state is facing a gap of approximately $1.85
billion for the next fiscal year. By bringing back only a
small portion of the taxes levied a decade ago, the state
could fill the perpetual budgetdeficit and restore funding
to higher education.
College Democrats, with help from Roosevelt Institu-
tion - a student policy organization - have detailed the
specific revenue increases and spending cuts necessary
to allow the state to reinvest in higher education. We took
our report to Lansing when we met with state legisla-
tors on Tuesday. Of course, our proposal likely won't be
adopted, but the message should have been clear: We can
balance the budget without doing it on the back of stu-
dents. And it takes little more than a notebook, a calcula-
tor and Google to figure out how.
State legislators aren't abandoning higher education
because it's the only choice, but because it's the easy
choice.
You can view our full proposal at http://umichdems.com.

chair of the University's chapter of College
Democrats education Committee. *

we'll hear from Bright Eyes.
Between the politically charged
punk rock of Desaparecidos,
jam-band stylings of supergroup
Monsters of Folk and spirited
southwestern country of the
Mystic Valley Band, Oberst
has a number of respectable
options when it comesto musical
endeavors.
However, The People's Key
serves as a reminder that Oberst
does his best work while wear-
ing the Bright Eyes tag. And as
the buoyant beat of the closing
track bounces along, it seems like
Oberst is talking directly to that
uncertain audience as he repeats
the title of the song. Bright Eyes
has always been a two-way rela-
tionship between Oberst's per-
sonal needs and the needs of his
audience.
Regardless of whether or
not this is the final Bright Eyes
release, it seems unfair to view
The People's Key as a farewell
album. Instead, it should be
judged as an album of many
merits - apart from any outside
circumstances. Even though the
issue of future releases is unre-
solved, the acknowledgment
provided in such a nostalgic-
sounding track will be comfort-
able to any listener.

No stopping for 'Traffic Light'

By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Arts Writer
At first glance it appears formu-
laic - three longtime friends now
in their 30s navigating the highs
and lows of rela-
tionships and *
families. But
don't be fooled Traffic Lg
by the simplistic
exterior - Fox's Pilot
"Traffic Light" Tuesdaysat
proves wonder-T
fully inventive. 9:30 p.m.
Chronicling FOX
the lives of three
college buddies and former team-
mates (more specifically, two
former teammates and a former
equipment manager), the show
portrays each at a different stage
of romance and the ways their

lives intersect. There's Mike
(David Denman, "The Office"),
a married lawyer with a son who
wants a little "me time;" Adam
(Nelson Franklin, "Scott Pilgrim
vs. the World"), a writer who just
moved in with his girlfriend and
frets about maintaining a social
life considering his new living
arrangements; and Ethan (Kris
Marshall, "Love Actually"), the
British paramedic who's always
single and always has a word of
advice for his committed com-
rades.
There is a decent amount of hi-
jinks that ensue among the char-
acters and their significant others,
with fine performances given
by Aya Cash ("Law & Order") as
Adam's girlfriend Callie and Liza
Lapira ("21") as Mike's wife Lisa.
An incident that involves Mike

donning a clown costume for the
bar mitzvah of Adam's boss's son
only to be discovered by his wife
feels a tad tried, but it's well exe-
cuted with excellent comedic tim-
ing from all involved.

BIEBER
From Page 5
with straight faces and deter-
mination, "One day, Justin and
I will be husband and wife." Or
husband and husband, if you
count the creepy old man rock-
ing out to Bieber's hit "Baby" at
the 11:00 showing of "Never Say
Never" last Friday. The film tries
tpfocus on how the star stays
cool and grounded in the midst
of all this craziness.
Rather than becoming a seri-
ous look into the life of a pop
sensation, "Never Say Never"
is more of a propaganda piece.
But it works to a point - Bieber
does come across as an ordinary
kid with really nice managers
and as someone that gives out
free tickets for his concerts to

unsuspecting fans. You learn
he's not perfect (he once broke
the leg on his grandpa's prized
taxidermized fox and blamed it
on his friend), but he prays for
the strength to be better and
believes in his dreams.
At the same time, having to
watch Justin Bieber give back to
his community again and again
is overkill. Though the movie
would have us believe that this
16-year-old boy spends all of
his time doing nice things for
people, it's just not possible. And
trying to make Bieber out to be
a run-of-the-mill kid completely
underscores how extraordinary
his story actually is.
For one thing, as a music pro-
ducer mentions, Justin Bieber
has accomplished more than
*NSYNC had in its day - and
he got to where he is now by

harnessing the power of the
Internet. Currently, JB has over
seven million followers on Twit-
ter - for a sense of comparison,
President Obama only has six
million. Combine that savvy
with his charm, and he becomes
a force to be reckoned with. But
to neglect this part of his story so
entirely and fill the movie with
creepy 3-D shots of him shaking
his infamous locks or all the dif-
ferent moments that he spends
praying make ita little painful to
sit through.
Bieber and his team insist that
he will not be subject to the tra-
ditional child star tragedy. But
all the manipulation involved
in crafting of Bieber's image
in "Never Say Never" doesn't
exactly make him seem any dif-
ferent from a Michael Jackson or
a Macaulay Culkin.

TRAFFIC LIGHT
From Page 5
developed for American audienc-
es as a midseason replacement by
screenwriter Bob Fisher ("Wed-
ding Crashers"). As demonstrat-
ed by his previous work, Fisher
has a keen understanding of adult
friendships.:
These characters aren't buf-
foons and the comedy isn't pro-
pelled forward, for the most
part, by thrusting them into
outlandish situations. Instead,
by the good fortune. of know-
ing its limitations, it gives us
real adults and the humor that's
inherent in .growing up. While
childhood-turned-adult friends
aren't uncommon in the world
of primetime sitcoms, this show
doesn't attempt glitz or glam-

our. It doesn't even take us into
uncharted territory. Rather, it
embraces the known world of
companionship by presenting
three friends who know and love
each other. From there, "Traffic
Light" takes off. The joy lies in
watching old friends deal with
changing times.
These guys are merely kids
grown a little older. They've been
there for each other and as life
takes themin different directions
their past keeps them bonded.
Only old buddies could comfort-
ably explain to one another that
"the burn notice rule (i.e. you
don't talk to ex-girlfriends) made
sense in college ... but we're off
the meal plan now." College may
be over for them, but the famil-
iarity of a college is the glue that
keeps the show lively and fresh.
In addition to a well written

script, there's a strong rapport
among the cast, with a scene-
stealing performance from
Nelson Franklin. He turns the
plight of a recently domesticated
30-something into a tangible
conflict viewers can relate to;
But more importantly,Franklin
can take an awkward silence and
turn it into a comedic gem. One
memorable scene has him ask,
ing for his girlfriend's blessing
to join his friends for drinks. It's
common sitcom ground, but he
approaches it with tact and ease.
The show walks a fine line
between comedy and sentiment,
but never does it force anything
upon the audience. Fromthe
mundane to the silly to the just
plain confusing, "Traffic Light"
keeps it real and invites the audi-
ence to share in the realistic pit-
falls of love and maturity -

Taking on the top ten

hree weeks ago my car
died, which has been a
total drag. But out of all
the convenience it granted me,
the thing I
miss most
about having
it is listen-
ing to pop
radio. So in
my Toyota's
memory, I'm
reviewing JOE
Billboard's DIMUZIO
top ten for
the week of
Feb. 7-13, most of which are new
to me.
1."BLACK AND YELLOW" -
WIZ KHALIFA
It's profitable if you can write
a hit song about colors. Anybody
can make it their anthem. Foot-
ball teams. High schools. Bum-
blebees. And thanks to Gucci,
yellow hasn't been this popular
since, well, ever.
The song's video pans over
the city of Pittsburgh, fills it
with ecstatic teens jumping
around in Pirates hats and all.
But the best part of the whole
thing is the first minute when
Wiz wakes up, swags up and
goes downstairs to kiss his mom
and eat some scrambled eggs
(yellow!). He lives at home, and
he's not too humble to admit it.
P.S. Does anyone else think
that hook sounds like a circus
in hell?
2."GRENADE" - BRUNO
MARS
Eh, not much to say on this
one. I thought it'd be a "Shore"
reference, but I was disappointed.
But Bruno's got a pretty sexy
voice. It's androgynous enough
to please anyone, comfortably
"weathered" and belts nicely.
Like any video on VEVO,
there were more comments
about Justin Bieber than Mr.
Mars on this one - which is odd
only because I realize I've come
to accept how pmmon thatsl.
3."FIREWORK" - KATY
PERRY
Whew. This song is exhaust-
ing. That chorus? It's a wrist-
breaker. The compulsion to fist
pump is scary strong.
"Teenage Dream" was triple-
A stuff, but "Firework" wants
to soar so much it crashes on

liftoff. And enough with these
pan-LGBT lip service tracks. If
you don't really mean it, don't
bother. You ever felt likea plas-
tic bag? Yeah ... me neither.
4."F**KIN' PERFECT" -
P!NK
I never realized P!nk had an
exclamation point in her name.
The song hasan F-bomb in the
title. Believe in yourself. So like
Perry in "Firework," P!nk sings
in widescreen - more power
to her. Is this the sort of song
which might save somebody
from killing themselves? Does
P!nk believe that she has that
ability to do that? Was it always
punk to care?
Like the friend who's found
Jesus, she's come so far from
"There You Go." I wish we could
go back there, but like she said
even back then - "Can't Take

is this song a promise? Running
commentary?
Regardless of the answer, no
song on this list had as clever
a pick-up line as "Let's remove
the space between me and you."
Think about that one for a few
seconds.
Done? Now another. Is Lud-
acris impossible to hate? That
one might take a little longer.
7. "ROCKETEER" -- FAR
EAST MOVEMENT FT. RYAN
TEDDER
Now, this is how you do it,
Katy. "G6" was fun, but this one
flies beautifully. Vaguely Bale-
aric, some huge piano and that
ubiquitous out-of-the-clouds
Bruno Mars hook (it's sung
by Ryan Tedder, but Mars co-
wrote). I want an instrumental
of this one - it's airborne.

masses sequins
and jazz hands instead of compel-
ling narratives, hoping they don't
notice you're feeding them com-
mercialized crap. The sad part is,
they don't notice. People still tune
in to "Glee." They may always
tune in to "Glee." Ryan Murphy,
you've created a monster, and you
ought to be ashamed of yourself.
The list of grievances is so long
it's hard to know where to start:
the shot-for-shot replicas of Brit-
ney Spears videos (we can see
those on YouTube, Murphy), the
weekly guest spots for any celeb-
rity with a passing interest in
"Glee," the whiny and immature
characters who are impossible to
root for. Let's begin with realism.
Yes, a show where high school
kids break out in song and dance
to convey their feelings isn't going
to be realistic. However, the writ-
ers have taken measures to bring
the musical numbers into the

realistic realm. In the second
season, there aren't random solos
just because Rachel (Lea Michele)
feels the need to express herself.
All songs have a motivation -
wish the plot did.
In the second season, "Furt"
brings Kurt's dad and Finn's mom
together for a tacky shotgun wed-
ding, where the glee club dances
down the aisle, viral video style.
Meanwhile, Sue Sylvester (Jane
Lynch) decides to get married to
herself Mercedes (Amber Riley)
gets a small story about body
image, but only to serve Gwyneth
Paltrow's guest spot - once she's
gone, the story stops. Sue inex-
plicably paints herself green for
the Christmas episode - as if we
wouldn't get it. Lauren (Ashley
Fink), better known as the geeky
wrestler girl, joins New Direc-
tions after rescuing Puck from a
Porta-John and hooking up with
him ina supply closet.
Will Schuester (Matthew Mor-
rison) displays the emotional
maturity of a12 year old in "Rocky
Horror Glee" where he desperate-
ly claws his way through school
policy so his students can perform
"Rocky Horror" - all so he can
win back the doe-eyed counselor
he cheated on in season one. He
shows a similar display of judg-
ment when performing "Toxic"
at a school assembly with New
Directions as kids in the audience
get so hot and bothered, they start
ripping their clothes off in the
most uncomfortable minute tele-
vision has ever seen.
Let's not forget that in season
one, when the glee club sexed
up a performance for the high
school assembly, Will was right-
fully aghast. Similarly, while per-

forming (another) mash-up with
the football team for the cham-
pionship game brought everyone
together for the big win this sea-
son, so did "All the Single Ladies"
last season. No one grows, and the
stories don'tchange.
Rachel is a mega-monster and
will always put herself first. Will
will always be a creepy loser. The
Quinn-Finn-Rachel-Puck-Sam
love pentagon will stand strong.
Sue is doomed to outlandish,
childish schemes as the writers
try to top her last stunt. The glee
club will fight, they'll get slushies
to the face, Will will try to reign
them in, they'll sing some Top 40
(specifically selected for maxi-
mum iTunes purchases) and go
home happy.
There is one redeeming quality
to the second season of "Glee" -
Murphy's commitment to tell the
story of the lone gay student liv-
ing among the intolerant. We got
chills when Karofsky (Max Adler)
threatened to kill Kurt (Chris
Colfer). We were angry when
there was nothing the school
could do about it. We celebrated
when Kurt found acceptance in
Blaine (Darren Criss). Amid the
petty fights over solos and scissor-
ing cheerleaders - added solely
for shock value - there is one real
issue with real emotions stillleft.
Still, the second season has
been nothing short of a train
wreck. "Glee" now exists solely
to make money. Songs for "Rocky
Horror Glee" were censored to
boost iTunes sales, the Glee cast
does commercials for Chevrolet,
and in the last episode, Blaine-
sang in a product-placed Gap.
This is no longer a TV show. It's a
schizophrenic cash cow.

rhymes so loud, so hard and so
free of range that it's all become
mush. He can't sit with a single
damn beat on any tune, no mat-
ter how pop the chorus, how
slick the collaborators. And in
the end, his shouting amounts
to so little. Hell, "We Made You"
was better than this.
Well, maybe not.
6. "TONIGHT (I'M LOVIN'
YOU)"- ENRIQUE IGLE-
SIAS FT. LUDACRIS AND DJ
FRANK E
Geez, Euro isback in a big
way. We're in tle middleof a
recession, and never have people
liked to party harder. Or at least
hear songs about it. And Enrique
has never crushed it harder. But

10. "HOLD IT AGAINST ME"
-BRITNEY SPEARS
Black Out's "Freak Show"
hinted at it, and here we have
it - Britney does dubstep. It's
sleazy in doses, fits her fine and
is still tame and pop enough to
chart.
This is probably the best song
on'the list by far, and if I said I"
was looking forward to her next
album you might scoff. But I
mean it when I say that Blackout
was one of the best albums of
the decade. It's good to have you
back, Britney.

Learning in Las Vegas

By DANIEL CARLIN
DailyArts Writer
While many students go to
Europe to "find themselves" fol-
lowing graduation, University
undergraduate alum Rick Lax
chose a different location after
his graduation from law school:
Las Vegas. In his second book,
"Fool Me Once: Hustlers, Hook-
ers, Headliners, and How Not to
Get Screwed in Vegas," which
came out last month, Lax takes
readers through his tales and
encounters of deceit in Sin City.
Lax isn't new to the author
experience. At the age of 26,
Lax had graduated from DePaul
School of Law and had already
published a memoir on that
experience, a book entitled
"Lawyer Boy: A Case Study on
Growing Up." Though most
of his peers tend to journey to
Europe following their gradua-
tions, Lax decided to make the
sojourn to Las Vegas.
"They go to Europe to go and
'find themselves,'" Lax said in a
recent interview with The Mich-
igan Daily. "I am pretty sure
that is code for just doing drugs
in Europe. For me, I don't like
backpacking, I like to be indoors
and I like air conditioning, so I
wanted to come to Vegas."
"Fool Me Once" leads readers
through the casinos of the Vegas
Strip and into a world full of fear
and deception. Lax has come to
Sin City on a mission: to figure
out a way to outsmart predators
and to not be duped.
"In Chicago, the girl that I
had been dating at the time -
she got conned by a drug dealer,
and that scared the shit out of
me," Lax said. "Iwanted to make

Saturday. dous shooter. Your numbers will

go up' ... But I love the way we're
finding him too."
It's not like Hardaway Jr.
wasn't putting up big scoring
numbers at various times ear-
lier in the season - in fact, the
swingman scored 19 in his col-
legiate debut against South Car-
olina-Upstate, and even lit up
then-No. 3 Kansas for the same
point total on Jan. 9.
But his production slipped
early in the Big Ten season
against the tougher competition.
And even when Hardaway Jr.
was producing, he wasn't always
the most efficientplayer -he often
made some very freshman-like
shot selections and didn't neces-
sarily operate in Beilein's offense
the way he was supposed to.

Hardaway also fell victim to
the same foul troubles that have
plagued redshirt freshman for-
ward Jordan Morgan and fresh-
man forward Evan Smotrycz.
Then came the game in Happy
Valley. Michigan's 65-62 win over
Penn State on Feb. 6 was a turn-
ing point for the team, as it kicked
off the Wolverines' current three-
game winning streak - their lon-
gest of conference play.
And it was also a turning
point for Hardaway Jr. After he
played just three minutes in the
first half due to foul trouble, the
guard scored all of his 13 points
in the last seven-and-a-half min-
utes of the game, helping Michi-
gan erase a 10-point second-half
deficit.
"I think (Hardaway Jr.) gets
so upset when he gets the quick
fouls, and it limits, obviously,
the time he can help us win a
game," Beilein said after the
Penn State game.
"I knew he was going to take
advantage of the time that he
had. We're trying to find new
ways to get him more involved,
and he certainly took advan-
tage of that today."
Hardaway Jr. hasn't looked
back since - a scary develop-
ment for opposing Big Ten
coaches.
"He punked our guys," Indi-
ana coach Tom Crean said
after falling to Michigan. "He's
a really good player ... He's
become a shot maker, where
earlier in the season he was a
shot taker.
"Out of a timeout, I said to

Freshman guard Tim Hardaway Jr. recorded his first career doable-doable last
Wednesday and scored a career-high 27 points on Sunday.

It's your future.
It's your plan.

(Hoosier guard Victor Oladipo),
'They just ran a play that they
don't run, and they just ran it at
you, and (Hardaway Jr.) got it.'
That's an embarrassment."
During the Wolverines' six-
game losing streak in January,
the team's offense often stag-
nated when sophomore point
guard Darius Morris struggled
to shoulder the load by himself.
Hardaway Jr.'s ascendance
means Morris now has a highly
skilled running mate - one that

can hit corner 3-pointers with
regularity, and one that can now
also create his own offense when
needed.
"The NCAA (Tournament) is
in the back of everybody's mind,"
Hardaway Jr. said. "That's what
everybody's dreaming, and we're
going to do everything we can to
get there."
With five games to go, those
dreams suddenly aren't so far-
fetched - and Hardaway's play
is a big reason why.

Freshman forward Luke Moffatt has tallied four goals in his rookie campaign for the Wolverines.
Freshman Moffatt blazes
trail from Arizona to'M'

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily SportsEditor
It didn't take Luke Moffatt
long to decide that Ann Arbor
was the place for him. And it
didn't take Michigan coach Red
Berenson any longer to discover
Moffatt's passion.
When Moffatt, now a fresh-
man on the No. 11 Michigan
hockey team, lifted a back-hand
high over the shoulder of Ohio
State goaltender Cal Heeter
midway through the first peri-
od on Saturday, he spun with a
relieved smile to greet his team-
mates. It was Moffatt's first goal
at home this season - but it cer-
tainly wasn't his first style point
at Yost Ice Arena.
Three years ago, the then-
15-year-old from Paradise Val-
ley, Ariz. strode into Berenson's
office in the bowels of Yost's old
barn with one goal in mind - to
become a Wolverine, and to do it
in true Clark Kent fashion. As the
meeting came to a close, Beren-
son told the high school sopho-
more that he could have as much
time as he needed to make a deci-
sion regarding the scholarship
Michigan was offering him.
But Moffatt didn't need
another second. He-stood up and
pulled off his sweater to expose
a maize Michigan shirt under-
neath.
"I had it all planned out ... I
just said, 'Coach, I want to be a

Wolverine,' " Moffatt said Mon-
day. "(Berenson) was pretty
happy.".
Hailing from the Southwest,
the seventh-round pick of the
Colorado Avalanche knew all
along that his next step in hock-
ey would be far from Arizona.
Moffatt moved to Ann Arbor
to join the U.S. National Devel-
opment Program the following
year - Michigan was that next
step.
"You've really got to go to
hockey places if you want to suc-
ceed in hockey," Moffatt said.
"Arizona is great hockey, noth-
ing against it, but I had to move
on at some point."
After turning down Notre
Dame, Minnesota, Wisconsin
and other hockey powerhouses
for a chance with the Wolver-
ines, Moffatt still had something
left to prove'- hockey players
are at a premium in Arizona,
but they're a dime a dozen in the
American hockey heartland.
"I was one of the top dogs in
Arizona, but now I was coming
out to the Midwest and out East
where it's more of a hockey hot-
bed," Moffatt said. "There are a
lot of good players out here, and
I was really wondering how I
compared with them, and I was
pleasantly surprised that I was
able to hold my own with them."
In Moffatt's first sixth months
at Michigan, it's been the coach-
ing staff who has been pleasant-

ly surprised.
To Berenson and his assis-
tants, Moffatt has turned from
just a highly-touted recruit into
the Wolverines' leading fresh-
man forward. He's 11th on the
team in points, with four goals
and eight assists in 26 games.
"He's in the mix," Berenson
said Monday. "He battles hard
on loose pucks. He's strong on
the puck and it was good to see
him show alittle skill around the
net, because he is a goal scorer,
we just haven't seen that side of
him yet."
After alternating starts with
freshman wingers Derek DeB- a
lois and Jacob Fallon, who was 1
dismissed from the team in
January, Moffatt earned a regu-
lar spot in the starting lineup by
asserting himself on both ends
of the ice.
"The thing I liked about Mof- N
fatt was his work ethic," Beren-
son said. "He's learning every
day, he's competing hard and
he's showing strength beyond a
freshman. When he gets on the
puck he's able to ward off some
of these ... stronger defensemen.
Moffatt was one forward who
handled that well.
"We've got other guys getting
knocked on their can, but not
Luke Moffatt"
The freshman is a regular
Superman - he doesn't have to
hide his Michigan t-shirt any-
more.
