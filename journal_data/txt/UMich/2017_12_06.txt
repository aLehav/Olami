The University of Michigan 

confirmed 
its 
unwavering 

support 
of 
research 
with 

the 
announcement 
of 
a 

record $1.48 billion in total 
research 
expenditures 
for 

the 2017 fiscal year ending 
on June 30. The Office of 
Research published this data 
in their annual report, which 
details the current research 
landscape at the University.

This announcement follows 

the No. 1 ranking in research 
volume 
the 
University 

recently received from the 
National Science Foundation 
for the seventh year in a row.

Though 
research 

expenditures reached a record 
high, the FY 2017 brought 
the challenge of declining 
total 
federal 
support 
for 

research. In response, the 
Office of Research partnered 
with 
various 
on-campus 

organizations to address the 
gaps in federal support and 
identify 
new 
avenues 
for 

funding.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

Jack 
Hu, 
vice 
president 

for 
research, 
continued 

investment in research sets 
the 
Unversity 
apart 
from 

other public institutions.

“The $1.48 billion research 

expenditures 
continues 
to 

place UM as the top public 

During its weekly meeting, 

Central 
Student 
Government 

proposed 
resolutions 
to 

compensate its assembly members 
financially and to create a student 
Regent that would serve on the 
University of Michigan’s Board of 
Regents. 

The compensation resolution, 

if 
passed, 
would 
pay 
CSG 

members for their work in the 
organization. In its proposed 
form, the president and vice 
president would be compensated 
hourly 
and 
representatives 

would 
receive 
stipends. 

Historically, CSG members have 
not been paid, as they are often 
considered a volunteer positions. 
However, many universities do 
pay their student government 
representatives.

Last 
year’s 
Leadership 

Engagement 
Scholarship 
was 

created to provide funding for 
low 
income 
student 
leaders 

interested 
in 
extracurricular 

activities they may not have time 
for otherwise. The scholarship 
received backlash, however, due 
to the possibility of increasingthe 
student fee paid for CSG’s budget. 

Members of the assembly, 

however, had concerns with 
the resolution based on how 
the 
compensation 
would 
be 

distributed. 
Rackham 
student 

Marzia 
Oceno 
debated 
the 

resolution 
because 
of 
laws 

regarding international students 
and financial aid.

“As an international student, 

I’m pretty concerned about the 
fact that according to how it’s 
shaped, if it’s a grant, it’s a grant,” 
Oceno said. “If it’s paid by hours, 
this can reduce participation for 
international students in CSG 
because they cannot get their 
money.”

CSG will vote on the resolution 

next week.

The resolution to establish 

a student Regent would create 
a student non-voter added by 
CSG who would serve on the 

University’s Board of Regents. 
An amendment would have to 
be added to the CSG constitution 
for this to occur. This has been a 
goal for CSG in the past, however 
there is ambiguity surrounding 
the position. Last year, during 
former CSG President David 
Scahfer’s term, CSG also wished 
to see a student member of 
the Regents. However, Regent 
members are elected statewide. 
The position also would have to 
be proposed in one of the three 
ways: the change can be placed 

on the ballot by a citizen-led 
initiative garnering a minimum 
of signatures, be referred to the 
ballot by the state legislature, or be 
amended through a constitutional 
convention.

Other proposed resolutions 

included purchasing “Munchie 
Money” $5 coupons for students 
to use toward food at University-
affiliated food vendors and $5 
gift cards to Barnes & Noble for 
study supplies during the final 
examination period.
Seeking a quiet place other 

than the library to work, 
two University of Michigan 
alumni began a movement to 
raise awareness and promote 
the benefits of silence and 
noise moderation around the 
city of Ann Arbor. Gina Choe 
and Libby Hunter founded 
Quiet Ann Arbor with the 
hopes of reducing noise and 
piped music in public places 
around 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Quiet 

Ann Arbor is associated with 
the Pipedown campaign in 
the United Kingdom, whose 
general mission is “Freedom 
from unwanted music in public 
places.”

Piped music is light, pre-

recorded music played in public 
spaces such as grocery stores, 
restaurants and coffee shops. 
Piped, 
canned 
or 
elevator 

music, like Muzak, piped music 
can affect one’s attitudes and 
has health concerns.

“Noise is a health concern 

for all of us not only for those 
with hearing issues,” Choe 
said. “Research clearly shows

The 
emotional 
support 

required for childbirth care can 
often be an internal instinct, 
some say. 

But 
for 
many 
students 

learning to become a doula — 

an individual trained to assist 
another during childbirth — 
there are important techniques 
and facts to learn to be successful 
and helpful. 

The University Prison Birth 

Project — a volunteer student 
organization that helps provide 
education, doula support and 
respect for incarcerated pregnant 
women before, during and after 

the labor process — holds Doula 
Information Training Sessions, 
like 
the 
one 
held 
Tuesday 

night, to learn more about the 
emotional support surrounding 
childbirth care.

While many consider being 

a doula unconventional, many 
students found it to be an 
empowering role to take on along 
with their studies.

Social Work student Hannah 

Mesa 
became 
a 
doula 
in 

2015, while she was still an 
undergraduate 
student. 
She 

stressed the importance of the 
care that doulas provide before 
and after the labor process — not 
just during physical labor.

“That’s something that I feel 

like gets left out of the picture,

In an attempt to make public 

service 
more 
accessible 
to 

students from diverse academic 
backgrounds, Central Student 
Government plans to launch 
Innovate, a public service pitch 
competition, this winter.

According to Sujay Shetty, 

Chief of Staff to the President and 
an Information junior, students 
with certain majors, usually 
political science or public policy, 
pursue 
public 
service. 
This 

competition, however, aims to 
expand public service interest 
across all majors.

“We’re operating with the 

framework 
that 
encourages 

collaboration between students 
from a broad range of disciplines,” 
he 
said. 
“There’s 
particular 

emphasis 
on 
unconventional 

disciplines in the realm of public 
service, and we hope that this 
can catalyze real-world, positive 
change.”

Tuesday evening, Central 

Student Government President 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 
an 
LSA 

senior, and CSG Vice President 
Nadine Jawad, a Public Policy 
senior, 
sent 
a 
school-wide 

email 
condemning 
neo-Nazi 

and white supermacist Richard 
Spencer’s potential visit to the 
University of Michigan campus.

Fearing an unsafe atmosphere 

on campus, Sarkar and Jawad 
asked students to sign a petition, 
which Sarkar plans to present to 
the Board of Regents Thursday.

The statement emphasizes the 

possibility of violence that would 
accompany Spencer’s visit.

“This is our home and we 

have the right to our safety 
and security, above all else. We 

did not choose to attend the 
University of Michigan only 
to fear violence and the unsafe 
atmosphere that come with 
Richard Spencer and the people 
that follow him,” it reads. “We 
did not come to the University 
of Michigan to put our lives on 
the line. We did not come to the 
University of Michigan to live in 
fear of being harmed.”

The statement also references 

the incidents regarding Spencer 
at the University of Florida, in 
which three white supremacists 
shot at counter protesters. It 
also mentioned Heather Heyer, 
a protester killed when struck 
by a car driven by a neo-Nazi at a 
Charlottesville, N.C. for another 
Spencer-led event.

“As the people who are 

at the highest risk of harm 
should Richard Spencer and his 
followers come to campus, we 

oppose Richard Spencer being 
on campus because he and his 
followers have a demonstrated 
track record of inciting fatal 
violence, to which we refuse 
to be subjected,” the statement 
reads. “We are looking to you 
to protect your constituents, 
your 
community, 
and 
your 

paying stakeholders against this 
violence.”

Safety has been one of the 

biggest concerns for students and 
professors on campus regarding 
Spencer. At last week’s CSG 
meeting, social justice group By 
Any Means Necessary asked the 
student assembly to condemn 
Spencer’s visit. Sarkar, however, 
said 
the 
possible 
resolution 

should focus on physical danger 
rather than conflict of thought.

“It’s 
pretty 
likely 
that 

University will go to court 
regardless,” she said. “If we 

pass a resolution that says 
that we reject him speaking 
here because of the content 
of his speech, they will use 
that to win the lawsuit. The 
resolution should focus on 
the fact that Spencer and 
his followers bring about 
violence.”

During the #StopSpencer 

teach-ins, history professor 
Anne Berg referenced the 
outbreaks of violence that 
have followed Spencer on his 
college tour.

“There is very recent 

historical 
precedent 

that when he shows up 
and 
speaks, 
things 
go 

wrong,” Berg said. “And 
the fact that our national 
administration 
has 
sort 

of responded in a sort of 
‘two sides’ kind of way, and 
Trump in particular saying 
‘there are always two sides 
to a story,’ no, as historians 
there are many more sides 
to any story than just two 
sides, but what is crucial 
here is that one side is 
looking for a fight.”

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

Every Wednesday, The Michigan 
Daily will be asking a University 
affiliate what the University’s 
Bicentennial means to them. 

“The first Filipino college 
students in America came to 
the University of Michigan, and 
that big history — the fact that 
they chose this school — just 
shows the inclusiveness of the 
school. They saw something 
in the University of Michigan 
that they didn’t see in any other 
school, and as Filipino student, 
that tradition is something I 
hold dear to my heart. “

that you also work with people 
beforehand,” Mesa said. “So 
you answer questions like, 
‘What should I expect? How 
do I prepare? What do I bring 
with me?’ ”

Kate Stroud, an experienced 

birth doula, led Tuesday’s 
session. Stroud explained how 
doulas provide emotional and 
physical support, information 
and answers to the mother-to-
be and family.

A doula must be prepared, 

when 
on 
call, 
to 
drop 

everything to come in and help 
with birth, Stroud explained. 
There are two options for 
doulas when it comes to being 
on call: A doula must either 
be on call for five weeks, 
during which time they are 
not permitted to leave within a 
one-hour radius of where their 
client lives. The other option is 

through the Dial-a-Doula, in 
which doulas can sign up for 
24-hour on-call shifts.

To become a doula, one must 

take a training session and then 
complete a certification within 
five years of the training. The 
certification process involves 
helping in three births. If one 
acts promptly, they can become 
certified within six months 
from their training session, 
Stroud said.

Stroud also explained how 

students can balance being a 
doula, especially being on call, 
with their academics.

“One of my very close friends 

was a student while doing 
doula work,” she said. “I met 
her through a doula training, 
and she communicated with 
her professors what she was 
doing and if they didn’t know 
what it was, she explained 
what a doula was and she 
reported that very rarely did 
she get a lot of hassle or flack 
from her professors.”

Elizabeth James is a program 

associate for the department 
of Afroamerican and African 
Studies and has been a doula 
since 2013. James said it is 
particularly important to train 
young people in childcare and 
doula work.

“I think it’s really important 

just 
in 
terms 
of 
women 

understanding 
more 
about 

their bodies,” James said. “It’s 
important, I think, because 
many students on campus 
will become mothers at some 
point and so understanding 
and educating yourself so that 
you’re prepared and can also 
assist others.”

Social Work student Armaity 

Minwalla is a termination and 
abortion doula. Birth doulas, 
however, are the most common 
type of doula, and the only type 
of doula you can train to be in 
Michigan. However, Minwalla 
was able to go out of state to 
receive her specific type of 
training.

Minwalla also thinks it’s 

important 
to 
educate 
and 

empower young people, thus 
allowing them to empower 
others.

“Reproductive 
health 
is 

about choice and is about 
empowerment,” she said. “And 
I think that the way the system 
is set up, a lot of times, and not 
always, I think there are a lot of 
practitioners that really do use 
the empowerment model, but a 
lot of times the empowerment 
model can be forgotten and 
people can push their own 
biases and their own agendas 
on pregnant people.”

Giving students the power 

to leave the classroom and 
empower 
other 
people 
is 

something that Mesa also finds 
important about being a doula.

“I’m in the classroom doing 

classroom work, right, being a 
student,” Minwalla said. “But 
one of the most rewarding 
aspects about doing doula work 
has been that I’m doing the 
actual work that I’m passionate 
about, I’m not just learning 
about it.”

research 
university 
and 

second among all universities 
in the country in terms of 
volume 
of 
research,” 
Hu 

wrote. “Since most of this 
funding 
is 
through 
peer-

reviewed competitive grants, 
it reflects the quality and 
competitiveness 
of 
our 

faculty.”

The Business Engagement 

Center worked with UMOR 
to 
strengthen 
industry 

relationships with over 1,200 
companies contributing to an 
overall 24.7 percent growth in 
industry-sponsored research 
expenditures, 
direct 
from 

corporations. UMOR has also 
explored innovative research 
funding programs such as 
MCubed, which encourages 

cross-campus 
faculty 

collaboration and grants seed 
money for research projects. 
MCubed has contributed $94 
million in research funding 
since being established in 
2012.

These efforts to diversify 

funding have led to the 14.1 
percent growth in the non-
federal sponsors bracket of 
total research expenditures. 
In the report, UMOR credits 
these 
alternative 
funding 

sources as the reason why 
the University has been able 
to sustain growth in research 
volume 
despite 
declining 

federal support.

“Federal 
support 
for 

research has on a decline 
or 
stagnant 
and 
future 

support is uncertain,” Hu 
wrote. “We must continue to 
work to diversify sources of 
research funding. Industry, 
foundations and philanthropic 

gifts represent a number of 
important opportunities.”

This breadth of funding 

has allowed the University to 
continue to provide research 
opportunities at all levels of 
study. LSA freshman Monica 
Olszewski is involved in the 
Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunity 
Program 
and 

has 
spent 
the 
semester 

researching nanoplastics and 
the environment. Olszewski 
expressed gratitude for the 
opportunity to engage with 
research 
during 
her 
first 

semester on campus.

“I walked into my chem lab 

not knowing what a microbe 
pipette was, but being in 
the lab now I know all the 
tools that I need, research 
methods, how to collect data, 
the proper tools I need to 
analyze that data and actually 
make educated conclusions 
in the end,” Olszewski said. 

“They really taught me a lot, 
more than I ever expected to 
learn in the last few months.”

LSA 
senior 
Olivia 

Kaiserlian, 
a 
research 

assistant in the Adolescent 
Brain Cognitive Development 
Study — which studies the 
relationship between brain 
development and substance 
abuse — said through her 
involvement 
in 
research 

she has come to appreciate 
the role of research at the 
University.

“At 
a 
University 
as 

resourceful as this we can 
really begin something bigger 
by starting small and even 
though we are just students 
we can really learn from 
(research),” Kaiserlian said. 
“I think it is great that (the 
government) put time and 
money into us, which we can 
return back to them once we 
come full circle.”

that constant loud noise has 
detrimental effects on our 
health.”

According to a Pipedown 

fact sheet, a survey of 215 
blood donors at University 
of 
Nottingham 
Medical 

School 
in 
January 
1995 

found 
piped 
music 
made 

donors more nervous before 
donating and more depressed 
afterwards than silence. The 
sheet also describes other 
health 
concerns 
of 
piped 

music 
including 
triggering 

or aggravating those with 
autism, Asperger’s syndrome, 
myalgic 
encephalomyelitis, 

tinnitus, 
hyperacusis 
and 

blindness. 
Choe 
discussed 

how 
noise 
pollution 
can 

decrease our immune system 
function and lead to higher 

risks of hypertension, stroke 
and heart failure. 

Pipedown states there is an 

increase in prices passed onto 
customers of the stores and 
restaurants which play this 
music. 

“Many 
people 
in 
our 

community 
have 
shared 

stories with us about their 
negative 
experiences 
with 

piped 
music,” 
Choe 
said. 

“People are really struggling 
with piped music and we really 
hope to alleviate some of that 
stress in our community.”

In research commissioned 

by the Royal National Institute 
for Deaf People, now known 
as Action on Hearing Loss, 34 
percent of the general public 
find piped music annoying. 
It also found that 86 percent 
of those who have difficulty 
hearing find this background 
music 
annoying, 
but 
36 

percent of the general public 
said they were “indifferent.” 

The 
Quiet 
Ann 
Arbor 

founders 
debunked 
the 

belief 
they 
themselves 

hate 
music. 
Choe 
played 

the piano, the guitar and 

enjoyed performing. Hunter 
graduated from the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance and 
taught music.

“We don’t hate music,” 

Choe said. “We just want to 
make music special.”

Pipedown has spread to 

Australia and has been shared 

on the national Pipedown 
page in the United Kingdom. 
They hope to grow their 
website, write letters to local 
Ann Arbor businesses and 
collect and publish decibel 
levels. Quiet Ann Arbor seeks 
to have restaurants and shops 
hold 
quiet 
hours 
without 

piped music during certain 
days and hours of the week.

LSA senior Jessica Murray 

said she works in an autism 
clinic and understands the 
significant, 
various 
ways 

piped 
music 
can 
impact 

members of the Ann Arbor 
community.

“There are obviously pros 

and cons to it, obviously 
music is meant to create an 
ambiance 
and 
atmosphere. 

But at the same time it is 
still important to consider 
members of the community 
who are negatively affected 
or negatively impacted by the 
piped music,” Murray said.

included it in their eMerge platform 
last semester.

Many details have yet to be 

finalized, Shetty said, but the 
competition is expected to span a 
couple months and feature three 
stages. 
Any 
undergraduate 
or 

graduate student at the University 
of Michigan is invited to participate. 
Multiple winners will be awarded a 
hierarchy of prizes, including grant 
money to pursue the proposed 
public service project.

Innovate 
was 
the 
primary 

focus of CSG’s Giving Blueday 
fundraising campaign. Though the 
amount of prize money remains 
undecided as CSG continues to 
raise funds for the project, they 
plan to use the money obtained 
from Giving Blueday and money 
in their Executive Discretionary 
account for winter 2018 to fund the 
competition.

Chief 
Programming 
Officer 

Isabelle 
Blanchard, 
an 
LSA 

sophomore, said CSG also aims to 
supplement partnerships with the 
Center for Entrepreneurship and 
Library Student Mini Grants.

The first stage of the competition, 

a mingling event intended to 
introduce individual projects and 
find partners who share similar 
passions, will take place on Jan. 
19. The next two phases, pitches 
in front of a panel of judges, and 
perhaps, the student body, are 
unscheduled, Blanchard said.

“I hope students will be able 

to realize the actual impact they 
can make on a college campus, 

whether it’s their first year or their 
last year,” she said. “I think that 
competitions really open a lot of 
doors for groups, and I think it’s 
really rare for students to be able to 
receive so much funding and work 
on a project continuously.”

CSG 
representative 
Zoha 

Qureshi, a Public Policy junior, 
believes it’s valuable for CSG to 

fund projects like Innovate.

“It is important for CSG to 

fund these kinds of competitions, 
because 
they 
elevate 
student 

voices, allow collaboration between 
students, and foster understanding 
of various perspectives — all 
important to making our campus a 
better place for us,” she said.

Qureshi hopes Innovate will 

inspire students of all academic 
backgrounds to consider the role 
public policy can play in their long-
term goals.

“As a Ford student, I hope the 

competition inspires first- and 
second-year students to consider 
how their interests and goals 
(health, economics, law, etc.) can 
be 
manifested 
through 
public 

service work, and how learning 
more about public policy can help 
these students reach those goals,” 
she said.

Ethics 
Committee 
Chair 

Lloyd Lyons, a Public Health 
senior, also announced an ethics 
investigation, which regarded 
a 
statement 
and 
“improper 

usage of CSG materials” by 
an assembly member without 
consulting 
CSG, 
had 
been 

closed. This member, Lyons 
clarified later to the Daily, had 
released a statement weeks 
earlier regarding #UMDivest 
on the behalf of CSG without 
discussing it with any of its 
members.

The group voted to not seek 

penalization 
of 
LSA 
senior 

Joe Goldberg, who is also on 
the executive member of the 
assembly, Lyons said.

“It was a statement on how to 

act (like) CSG stating we need 
to act in a certain way around 
this issue as it’s a divisive topic, 
where of not seeing the second 
half of him correcting himself it 
could be seen as CSG only takes 
one side on the issue and it’s 
not going through a collective 
process of letting the members 
themselves 
think 
about 
an 

issue,” Lyons said.

Goldberg also spoke to the 

members.

“I 
am 
glad 
to 
see 
the 

committe clear my name of 
any 
wrongdoing,” 
Goldberg 

said. “I thank them for their 
time and diligence in making a 
firm, thoughtful and attentive 
decision. ”

In a majority secret ballot, 

the group voted Engineering 
sophomore Zeke Majeske the 
new 
ethics 
committee 
vice 

chair.

Majeske has been outspoken 

this past semester. During CSG’s 
debate to support the name 
change of science building C.C. 
Little, Majeske was one of the 
few critics of the resolution — 
which passed, 25 in favor and 
four against.

Majeske said in an interview 

with The Daily he had concerns 
with the lack of historical 
context in the resolution that 
did not compare the former 
president to people of his time.

“I voted no because I thought 

the resolution was really one-
sided. 
I 
didn’t 
think 
they 

brought up any of the concerns 
of the people who actually didn’t 
want the building to change its 
name,” he said.

In 
community 
comments, 

members 
of 
BAMN, 
the 

national coalition to Defend 
Affirmative Action, Integration 
and 
Immigrant 
Rights 
and 

Fight for Equality By Any 
Means 
Necessary, 
expressed 

concerns over the ending of 
the DACA program’s effects on 
undocumented students and the 
possibility of Richard Spencer 
speaking at the University.

Last meeting, Kate Stenvig, 

an organizer for BAMN, linked 
the violence that unfolded in 
Charlottesville, Va., in August 
to Michigan State University’s 
decision to not allow Spencer to 
speak on campus.

“There are a lot of campuses 

that have denied him … and that 
doesn’t have anything to do with 
the First Amendment,” she said. 
“Everywhere Richard Spencer 
has gone has been accompanied 
with physical violence.”

A resolution calling for the 

University to prioritize student 
physical, mental and emotional 
safety over Richard Spencer 
passed 20 to 3.

Majeske 
proposed 
an 

amendment to ask students not 
to engage in potential violence if 
Spencer were to come to campus. 
However, the amendment failed 
due to concerns over its relevancy, 
since 
the 
University 
is 
still 

negotiating with Spencer’s group.

“O 
 

h 
my 
gosh! 

That 
looks 
so 

complicated! You 

are so smart; I could never 
do that.” These are 
often the responses I 
get when my friends 
look at my computer 
while 
I’m 
doing 

my 
homework. 

But, the truth is, 
my 
homework 

really 
isn’t 
that 

complicated. 
Sure, 

the lines of code may 
look 
intimidating, 

but if you were to 
see a male student 
coding on his computer in the 
library, would you think he 
were exceptional? Or would 
you think he were a genius? 
No, you wouldn’t.

There is an extreme double 

standard 
between 
men 

and women in the field of 
technology. When I was three, 
I wanted to be a pop star, not 
a computer scientist. Society 
conditioned me to believe jobs 
related to engineering and 
science were only for men. I 
would have never guessed that 
I, a woman, would ever walk 
into lecture halls to study 
coding languages surrounded 
by 
male 
students, 
male 

professors and male Graduate 
Student Instructors.

I was never the smartest kid 

in class. I constantly struggle 
with 
different 
concepts 
I 

learn, and it takes a lot of 
brainpower for me to master 
them. Last year, when I came 
to the University of Michigan, 
a senior recommended that I 
take a computer science class 
(“You will learn so much! You 
won’t regret it!”) and to this 
day, I don’t. I learned more 
in my first computer science 
course than I did in any other 
class I have taken thus far in 
my academic career.

I worked really hard and 

ended up being a successful 
student. 
Though 
I 
didn’t 

receive an A, the knowledge 
I gained in that course far 
exceeds what you will see 
reflected 
by 
my 
grade. 
I 

learned that doing something 
you actually enjoy allows you 
to learn from your failures 
and accept them as part of the 
process. Studying a subject you 
are passionate about enables 
you to accept setbacks because 
of your determination to do 

better and benefit because 
of 
it. 
I 
experienced 
this 

firsthand while learning how 
to code. Pushing myself to do 

something I never 
thought 
I 
would 

has 
allowed 
me 

to learn more and 
work harder than 
I ever imagined I 
would when I came 
to college.

When 
I 
first 

enrolled 
in 
this 

computer 
science 

class, I thought I 
was 
contributing 

to 
changing 
the 

stereotype 
of 
this 
male-

dominated 
industry; 
that 

I 
would 
help 
change 
the 

reputation that only men can be 
successful in STEM fields. 

However, 
I 
was 
wrong. 

Disproving people’s prejudices 
was and still is harder than 
I thought it would be. I have 
faced the harsh reality that 
you can’t change the minds 
of thousands of individuals 
by simply enrolling in a class. 
They assume things about 
you, they think you won’t be 
as successful as your male 
counterparts and they give 
you attitude for asking too 
many questions.

The stigma that surrounds 

women in STEM fields goes 
far 
beyond 
what 
female 

students will experience on 
the University’s campus. A 
study from Girls Who Code 
states that about 74 percent of 
young girls express interest 
in STEM fields and computer 
science. Yet, research shows 
that women earn only 18 

percent of computer science 
degrees 
and 
hold 
only 
11 

percent of executive positions 
in Silicon Valley. I wonder what 
deterred the rest from pursuing 
their childhood dreams?

Needless to say, there have 

been countless instances in 
which 
women 
have 
faced 

sexism in the tech industry. 
Earlier 
this 
year, 
Justin 

Caldbeck resigned from his 
venture capital firm, Binary 
Capital, 
after 
six 
female 

employees accused him of 
sexually 
harassing 
them. 

Also in 2017, Susan Fowler 
made news when she spoke 
out about the sexism she 
faced as a female working as 
a software engineer for Uber. 
The harsh reality surrounding 
women 
in 
top 
positions 

at 
corporate 
technology 

companies discourages young 
girls from pursuing degrees in 
those fields and taking jobs at 
specific companies.

I know I am just as capable 

as the next person, and I know 
being a girl does not mean I 
will accomplish less. In fact, it 
makes me work harder, so that 
I can show everyone that just 
because I was born a specific 
sex does not mean I will 
amount to less.

The truth to all of this is 

that everything is hard until 
it gets easy. A good friend of 
mine always tells me this, 
which I have found to be 
true: No matter which path 
you choose, no matter which 
class you take, you have to 
put the effort in to actually 
learn. Once you practice it, 
it becomes easier. So no, my 
homework really is not that 
complicated, and no, I am not 
a genius.

We 
should 
all 
actively 

encourage girls to pursue 
STEM. 
There 
are 
many 

organizations 
around 
and 

outside 
of 
campus 
that 

women in technology can 
join to learn from others and 
gain opportunities to grow. 
The more we raise awareness 
about these issues, the more 
the gender gap will close 
and the more women will 
be able to prosper in male-
dominated workplaces such 
as the tech industry.

T

his past week, chants 
of “Hey hey, ho ho, 
Richard 
Spencer 
has 

got to go” rang on our campus. 
Simultaneously, in Honduras, 
the rallying cry of “Fuera 
JOH” (out with Juan Orlando 
Hernández) resonated in the 
streets, the media and the 
collective consciousness of a 
burgeoning movement of mass 
political resistance. 

Hondurans 
went 
to 
the 

polls on Nov. 26 to decide who 
would be the next president, 
and still, a winner has yet to be 
officially announced. The main 
contenders were Juan Orlando 
Hernández, 
the 
National 

Party incumbent running for 
a 
constitutionally-disputed 

second 
term, 
and 
Salvador 

Nasralla, 
a 
sportscaster 

turned 
politician 
who 
has 

created an alliance between 
anti-corruption 
and 
leftist 

opposition parties.

On the night of the election, 

both candidates declared their 
respective victories despite the 
unprecedented silence of the 
Supreme 
Electoral 
Tribunal 

(TSE), which did not release a 
preliminary vote count until 
almost 10 hours after the polls 
had closed. When the TSE 
finally broke its silence, Nasralla 
was leading by a margin of 5 
percent with 57 percent of the 
votes counted.

Then, suddenly, there was 

an electronic malfunction in 
the vote counting technology. 
After an eight hour pause, the 
count resumed, and Hernández, 
the candidate considered most 
favorable 
to 
U.S. 
interests, 

began to bridge the gap and 
eventually surpassed Nasralla 
in the count. The TSE finally 
finished the count Monday, and 
the results show that Hernández 
is leading with 42.98 percent of 
the vote compared to Nasralla’s 
41.39, a difference of only 52,347 
votes. 
However, 
the 
many 

irregularities documented in 
the voting centers, which have 
prevented the announcement 
of a winner, raise suspicion of 
widespread electoral fraud.

With the exception of a few 

U.S. Congress members who 
denounced the way the election 
was handled, our government 
has not firmly addressed the 
situation beyond calling on 
everyone to respect the TSE’s 
results. 
The 
day 
after 
the 

election, I struggled to find 
American 
news 
reports 
on 

the situation, and I drew only 
blank stares on campus when I 
brought it up. While the market 
for international news reporting 
and consumption is competitive, 
the lack of attention to Latin 
America is indicative of a larger 
political project that encourages 
ignorance of U.S. influence over 
these countries.

The silence on U.S.-Latin 

American relations supports 
the implicit conclusion that the 
irregularities in the Honduran 
election are the fault of weak 
democratic 
institutions 

resulting from a culture of 
corruption. However, this view 
obscures a long history of U.S. 
intervention that undermined 
Latin American democracies 
at the price of protecting our 
economic interests (Guatemala, 
Chile, 
Argentina, 
Brazil, 

Nicaragua, 
El 
Salvador, 
to 

name a few). Under the guise 
of preventing the spread of 
communism, 
the 
U.S. 
has 

propped 
up 
several 
Latin 

American dictators, providing 
economic support and training 
of military forces to weed 

out 
any 
leftist 
tendencies 

that would block access to 
multinational corporations.

While many shy away from the 

term colonialism, throwing in the 
“neo-” prefix accurately describes 
the 
economic 
and 
political 

influence we have covertly, and at 
times openly, maintained in Latin 
America. Almost every Latin 
American country bears the scars 
of U.S. intervention.

Yet, the covert nature of our 

actions 
means 
any 
political 

instability is always blamed on 
Latin American culture, a form 
of victim shaming that alleviates 
any U.S. guilt. As a result, the day 
following the Honduran election, 
I was not surprised to find few 
knew what was going on, and 
even fewer felt the U.S. had any 
responsibility to respond.

The 
most 
recent 
coup 

in Honduras was in 2009. 
President Manuel Zelaya, who 
implemented many progressive 
reforms, was overthrown by 
the military after proposing a 
referendum to allow presidents 
to serve two terms instead of one. 
While the mere suggestion of 
adding another term was enough 
to get Zelaya overthrown, a year 
into Hernández’s presidency, 
the Honduran Supreme Court 
ruled to allow him to attempt 
reelection. Hernández, elected 
in 
2013, 
aligns 
with 
U.S. 

economic interests. We have not 
questioned the legality of his bid 
for reelection.

After the 2009 coup, we 

recognized the government of 
Porfirio Lobo Sosa, even though 
other Latin American countries 
refused, 
and 
we 
continued 

to support him despite the 
increase in state repression. The 
support for autocratic leaders in 
Latin America has always cut 
across U.S. party lines. Former 
President 
Barack 
Obama 

supported Lobo Sosa and what 
he called the “restoration of 
democratic practices.” Former 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Hillary 

Clinton, at that time, denied 
what had happened was a coup.

While the U.S. media reflects a 

slight unease with Hernández’s 
bid for reelection, we have been 
slow to condemn the fraud. I 
suspect this has much to do with 
Nasralla representing a coalition 
of leftist parties — some labeled 
as socialist.

Given the allegations of fraud 

and the mysterious electronic 
complications in the vote count 
that preceded the reversal of 
the electoral trend, Nasralla 
has refused to recognize the 
results of the election should 
Hernández 
be 
declared 
the 

winner. While the remaining 5 
percent of ballots that showed 
“inconsistencies” were counted 
by hand, Nasralla’s Alliance 
Against 
the 
Dictatorship 

coalition is demanding a more 
comprehensive recount of the 
votes or a redo of the election. 
Since the results are bound to 
be close, the call for a recount 
is neither unprecedented nor 
unwarranted.

In light of the TSE’s failure to 

consider a recount, which seems 

to confirm corruption, many 
Hondurans have taken to the 
streets to protest. In response, 
the government, still controlled 
by Hernández, installed a curfew 
from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and ordered 
the military to shut down public 
demonstrations. So far, at least 11 
people have died and more than 
1,000 have been arrested.

Despite the dangers presented 

by this autocratic crackdown, 
every 
day 
throughout 
the 

country 
Hondurans 
have 

participated 
in 
marches, 

blockades and cacerolazos, a 
form of popular protest in which 
people bang pots and pans in 
the street. Many have united 
behind the figure of Nasralla 
to 
combat 
the 
corruption 

threatening their democracy. On 
Monday, some factions within 
the police refused to enforce 
the curfew. The magnitude of 
popular resistance proves that 
one cannot fault the nation for 
lacking “democratic culture.” 
In response, Hernández has 
assumed dictatorial-like authority 
and is desperately trying to hang 
onto power, drawing on any 
internal or international support 
he can muster.

This puts the U.S. public 

in a familiar position. We can 
choose to continue the practice 
of turning a blind eye to the 
questionable actions of our own 
government in Latin America. 
We can continue to tacitly 
support 
a 
dictator 
because 

the 
democratically 
elected 

alternative is leftist. We can 
continue to pretend this election 
does not concern us. But we 
must recognize that this means 
erasing our history just as much 
as theirs. It empties out the 
ideal of our national integrity by 
putting all the blame elsewhere. 
After all, it’s always easier to 
continue with the status quo.

Or, we can choose to stand 

in solidarity.

Drawing 
from 
our 

University’s 
conflict 
over 

whether or not to allow white 
nationalist 
Richard 
Spencer 

speak on campus based on 
arguments of free speech, or 
the recent revelations about 
Michael Flynn and Russia, we 
can 
recognize 
that 
putting 

democracy into practice isn’t 
always easy. Our democracy has 
a lot of problems too, including 
the mandate we always give 
our leaders to take neocolonial 
actions that subvert democracy 
in Latin America.

We can take a few seconds to 

Google “Honduras elections,” 
“Honduras 
history” 
and 

maybe even “History of U.S. 
intervention 
in 
Honduras.” 

We can bring it up with our 
friends and in our classes. We 
can contact our representatives 
and tell them we’re done being 
bystanders and we’re ready 
to recognize our share of the 
guilt. We can tell them we don’t 
want to recognize the results 
of the election unless there is 
a complete recount of all the 
votes cast because we know 
democracy is fragile enough 
without 
outside 
influences 

actively trying to subvert it.

We 
can 
learn 
from 
the 

mass political mobilization in 
Honduras, apply their tactics in 
our own fights for democracy, 
use their awakening of political 
consciousness to spur our own. 
And when we raise our voices 
to chant “Richard Spencer has 
got to go,” we can add our own 
“Fuera JOH.”

The museum is located off of S. State Street
The UMMA exhibit ‘What 
Were You Wearing’ fights 
generalizations of assault

UMMA joined with HeforShe for a one-time exhibit in AA

“What were you wearing?”
A business suit, jeans, a 

sweater, a sweatshirt, joggers, 
athletic shorts, a tank top, 
pajamas, a dress. You’re going 
to work, you’re going to class, 
you’re going to a party, you’re 
going to a friends house or 
you’re going to bed. Something 
is about to change. Something 
is about to become a plot point 
in the line of your life — one 
that is uninvited, one that is 
cruel, one that you did not 
expect and one that you will 
never erase.

“What were you wearing?”
The 
question 
hangs 
in 

the 
air: 
seemingly 
simple, 

mundane, usual. Four words, 
17 letters and a question mark 
— all dangling in blank space. 
But in many situations, this 
question is really rather loaded 
— provoking anger, sadness, 
discomfort and confusion.

Many survivors of sexual 

assault will hear this question, 
asked by a friend, an employer, a 
police officer, a family member, 
an investigator, inviting the 
notion that perhaps if the 
victim was wearing something 
revealing, they were inviting 
the violence. The University of 
Michigan Museum of Art’s one 
night only exhibit “What Were 
You Wearing?” looks to start a 
conversation that silences that 
generalization.

UMMA, 
in 
partnership 

with University and national 
organization HeforShe, brought 
the exhibit to the University, 
as 
its 
message 
resonates 

greatly 
with 
our 
current 

campus and national climate. 
The exhibit was originally 
started at the University of 
Kansas by Jen Brockman. It 
features replications of outfits 
that sexual assault survivors 
we wearing and quotes from 
their stories, gathered from 
interviews by Brockman.

The 
exhibit 
looks 
to 

deconstruct the notion that 
people are only assaulted if 
they are wearing something 
revealing, and a victim could 
have been “asking for it” based 
on what they were wearing. 
There were around twenty 
outfits hung on a rack around 
the space, with the stories 
posted above them. Of the 
outfits, 
the 
majority 
were 

everyday 
clothes 
— 
jeans, 

oversized sweatshirts, workout 
clothes, shorts and t-shirts. 
Of the stories posted above 
the outfits, some especially 
thought 
provoking 
quotes 

included:

“I was wearing Nike shorts 

and 
a 
concert 
sweatshirt. 

Seems so normal. So every day. 
It was too, just any other day, 
except for this. Except for what 
happened.”

“The first time I was wearing 

jeans and a blue t-shirt. The 
next time, years later, I was 
wearing jeans and a blue 
t-shirt. I wear blue sometimes 
when I kickbox or when I need 
to be assertive. Even today I 
am wearing blue, because they 
don’t get to take away my voice, 
my favorite color or my ability 
to say no and mean it. These 
things are mine.”

“White t-shirt and black 

basketball shorts. It was always 
the same outfit. It was always 
at the rec center. I trusted him. 
My mom trusted him.”

The exhibit does a wonderful 

job of expressing that it doesn’t 
matter who you are, it doesn’t 
matter what you’re wearing, 
it doesn’t matter where you 
are, it doesn’t matter the 
circumstance. 
No 
means 

no, and assault is never the 
survivor’s fault. Assault can 
happen to anyone, at any time. 
The exhibit also provided an 
array of experiences through 
different ages, locations and 
circumstances –– to prove 
that this can and does happen 
anywhere.

From the wide array of 

individuals (both male and 
female) 
whose 
stories 
are 

included in the exhibit, it 
is clear that there is no one 
specific 
circumstance 
for 

sexual 
assault. 
Those 
who 

attempt to define assault as 
a singular thing generalize 
the implications of assault 
and 
associate 
or 
trivialize 

experiences 
are 
wrong. 

These 
stories 
being 
told 

(and 
others) 
are 
personal, 

absolutely heartbreaking and 
not 
uncommon 
on 
college 

campuses.

The sexual assault climate on 

the University’s campus is like 
that of many other universities, 
which is both saddening and 
unfortunate. According to the 
University’s Campus Climate 
Report from 2015, 22.5 percent 
of female undergrad and 6.8 

percent of male undergrad 
students experienced a form 
of 
non 
consensual 
sexual 

activity in the past 12 months. 
And the 2017 Annual Security 
Report stated that there were 
26 cases of rape, 22 of fondling, 
29 of stalking and 29 of dating 
violence on our campus last 
year. Keep in mind, these are 
the numbers of people who felt 
comfortable and safe reporting 
these 
crimes. 
With 
this, 

HeforShe saw a great need for a 
larger conversation about these 
issues; which inspired bringing 
the exhibit to this campus.

As seen by the statistics 

above, there are major issues 
with 
assault 
and 
domestic 

violence on this campus. It 
is terrifying how, in today’s 
world, 
sexual 
assault 
has 

grown, 
maintained 
itself 

and become normalized on 
college campuses everywhere. 
Recently, 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Interfraternity 

Council suspended all social 
activities 
and 
pledging 

activities 
due 
to 
several 

alarming incidents — one of 
them, which is unfortunately 
no surprise, is a growth in 
cases of sexual assault.

Erasing 
the 
stigma 
and 

normalization of the culture 
of sexual assault is a step that 
the exhibit at UMMA this 
past Monday looked to take. 
It is a long battle, but one that 
must start somewhere. The 
exhibit provided a space for 
conversation, 
education 
for 

those do not feel well informed 
on these issues and the larger 
message: 
Assault 
can 
and 

does happen to anyone. It is 
not normal, it does not have 
a 
specific 
circumstance, 
it 

cannot ever be justified and it 
should not go unnoticed.

This exhibit and its message 

is 
incredibly 
important 

right now, not only because 
of 
the 
problems 
occurring 

on our campus, but also the 
climate surrounding assault 
nationally. For the first time, 
sexual assault is being brought 
into the conversation on a 
national scale. In Hollywood 
and major news corporations, 
powerful men have been fired 
for sexual assault allegations, 
and people are finding space 
to share their personal stories 
of sexual assault. Campaigns 
like “#MeToo” have spread all 
over social media, empowering 
individuals and validating the 
stark reality of the situation. 
It 
seems 
that 
more 
and 

more individuals are being 
encouraged to come forward 
with their stories so that the 
pervasiveness of these issues 
can finally be seen.

And this is only the start.

Goddesses we don’t deserve to have
Replaying: ‘Feeling Myself’

Returning to Beyonce & Nicki Minaj’s overlooked single

The 
Pinkprint, 
Nicki 

Minaj’s third LP, released 
7 singles (“Pills N Potions,” 
“Anaconda,” “Only,” “Bed of 
Lies,” “Truffle Butter,” “The 
Night Is Still Young,” “Trini 
Dem Girls,” respectively). This 
boggles my mind. First of all, 
seven singles is excessive, even 
more so considering their from 
a rapper who prides herself 
on chart performance, but 
only one cracked the top ten. 
(“Anaconda” peaked at #2, but 
clearly should’ve gone #1.) The 
final single, Trini Dem Girls 
which features Lunchmoney 
Lewis, didn’t chart and doesn’t 
even have a wikipedia page 
(lol).

Her new album ~hopefully~ 

drops next week, nearly three 
years after the release of The 
Pinkprint, so it’s time to talk 
about the its greatest deep cut, 
arguably one of the greatest 
deep 
cuts. 
The 
sequel 
to 

“***Flawless (Remix)” (which 
was the number 1 song of 2014 
according to Time): “Feeling 
Myself (feat. Beyonce).”

I love (loooooove) Nicki 

Minaj, 
and 
she 
herself 

acknowledges that sometimes 
she is left in the lurch of the 
men she collaborates with. It’s 
an easy get for male rappers 
to feature Minaj to increase 
airplay and streaming numbers 
but on the flipside, Minaj’s solo 
work goes underappreciated 
on radio. This pattern also 
bleeds 
into 
Minaj’s 
own 

discography. During “Only,” a 
track off The Pinkprint, I go in 
during Minaj’s opening verse 
and immediately change it 
once Lil Wayne or Chris Brown 
pick it up. Okay, sometimes 
I stick through it for Drake’s 
verse 
— 
only 
sometimes, 

though. Ditto for “Truffle 
Butter”: Lil Wayne’s verse is 
honestly just gross, and I like 
to think I have a relatively 
high tolerance for gross sex 
stuff but damn. Additionally, 
it wasn’t until recently I was 
able to fully appreciate Minaj’s 
bars in “Buy a Heart” and 
“Big Daddy” (features with 
ex Meek Mill) because I so 
rarely stuck around through 
Mill’s opening verses. I have 
since had a change of heart 
regarding Mill’s contribution 
to “Buy a Heart.”

To bring us back to 2017 

for a moment, two of Minaj’s 
#ThreePackfromParis, 
“No 

Frauds” and “Changed It,” 
renew 
the 
tendency: 
the 

former featuring Lil Wayne 
and Drake, the latter featuring 
only Wayne. On both tracks 
Minaj’s bars are solid. Both 
verses are worth a rewind, a 
replay and a revisit whenever 
the thought or opportunity 
presents itself, but the tracks 
lose 
their 
energy 
without 

Minaj 
at 
the 
helm. 
“No 

Frauds,” specifically because it 
was released as a response diss 
track to Remy Ma’s 5-minute, 
bars-loaded “Shether.” While 
“No Frauds” flexes Minaj’s 
A-list status, it fails to show 
her as a master MC. The lyric “ 
‘Back to Back’? / Oh you mean 
back to whack?” rings slightly 
false seeing that Drake bodied 
Meek on “Back to Back,” Nicki 
got a few good shots in on “No 
Frauds” but Rem slaughtered 
Minaj on “Shether,” as far as 
bars go.

But, 
nonetheless, 

since 
the 
release 
of 

#ThreePackfromParis, Minaj 
has consistently been featured 
on some of hip hop’s hottest 
tracks of 2017. Everyone can 
agree that “Rake It Up” would 
be nothing without Minaj. 
Ditto with “Swish Swish.”

Okay, 
I 
have 
digressed. 

Back to the reason we are 
here: “Feeling Myself (feat. 
Beyonce)”. 
It’s 
the 
fifth 

track from the rapper’s third 
album and it has received an 
appalling lack of attention 
and appreciation from radio, 
awards show and, probably, 
you. (Until now.)

First and foremost, this 

track 
brings 
together 
the 

Queen of Rap and the Queen 
on the Universe, both of whom 
aren’t afraid to own and flaunt 
that status they have reached. 
While 
the 
argument 
that 

Beyonce is underutilized on 
the track could be fair: both 
women use to track to feel 
themselves by flexing their 
accomplishments. B stanks, 
“Changed the game when that 
digital dropped / Know where 
you was when that digital 
popped / I stopped the world.”

But it’s Nicki who shines 

brightest, closing out the song 
she spits, “Just on this song 
alone, bitch is on her fourth 
flow.” Minaj is, and has been, 
one of the top MCs and “Feeling 
Myself” is a testament. Three 
verses, four flows and back-up 
from the biggest star in music. 
Not to mention she drops some 
of her hardest bars of her 
career. Listening to the song 
and looking up the lyrics for 
examples is fruitless because 
the entire song slaps. EVERY. 
VERSE. POPS. OFF.

If you don’t believe me, here 

are the worst lines of each 
verse:

1. n/a
2. n/a
3. n/a
Fuck y’all I tried.
Moving 
on: 
the 
music 

video. Remember when Nicki 
tweeted her displeasure that 
“Anaconda” 
(egregiously) 

wasn’t nominated for video of 
the year? But the most absurd 
snub went largely unnoticed: 
Why did “Feeling Myself” fail 
to pull a single nomination? 
Sure, it was a Tidal exclusive, 
but 
I 
don’t 
think 
that 

disqualifies it. (I don’t know, 
I haven’t read the VMA rule 
book because I am too busy 
stanning 
these 
women 
on 

Twitter.)

Remember 
when 
Taylor 

Swift 
assembled 
her 
“girl 

squad” for the “Bad Blood” 
video? 
Or 
when 
Madonna 

followed-up 
by 
digitally 

placing 
Kanye, 
Beyonce 

and Minaj in the “Bitch I’m 
Madonna” 
video 
alongside 

real-life 
appearances 
by 

Alexander Wang and Diplo? 
Minaj and Beyonce — all in 
their lonesome — blow both of 
those groups out of the water, 
the industry and galaxy all on 
their own.

I say this a human who can 

hear and see, not as a stan, 
but every frame in this video 
is a keeper. I’m trying to pick 
the highlights out but they’re 
ubiquitous. The two baddest 
bitches become the two coolest 
just outside of the Coachella’s 
city limits. It’s hard to tell 
whether they’re messin’ around 
instead of going to the festival 
or throwing a dope after-party 
but it looks like a healthy mix 
of both.

The outfits are sick. Beyonce 

rocks a Chicago Bulls bathing 
suit, Nicki rocks a Moschino 
one-piece; Fur coats in blow-
up pools; Nicki reps the double 
sports-bra; and of course, the 
mesh “PERVERT” tee. Also, 
Beyonce is the only person who 
looks good in a bucket hat. The 
video is similar to Beyonce’s 
“7/11” in its casual nature: the 
MC and singer just hanging, 
stunting, 
in 
their 
amazing 

dream Airbnb booking for their 
Coachella weekend.

The video even goes as 

far as showing a (hopefully) 
candid moment the two share 
backstage at the festival sharing 
gum. The product placement is 
chosen-wisely 
and 
playfully 

placed: a fridge full of Ace of 
Spades and Myxx Moscato, 
empty bottles of the former 
floating in the pool and hot tub, 
and the pair eat “#2 with Mac 
sauce” on a bounce house while 
Nicki holds her Myxx.

It’s 3 minutes and 45 second 

of 
straight 
flexing. 
Their 

skills, 
their 
brands, 
their 

accomplishments. 
They’re 

well, feeling 
themselves.

As another year approaches 

its end, I find myself both 
thrilled 
and 
saddened 
at 

the thought of making my 
personal 
“Albums 
of 
the 

Year” list. It’s a time of 
contemplation and discourse, 
with myself and my peers. It’s 
a time to hash out our guilty 
pleasures and undying loves 
that 
blossomed 
throughout 

the past 365 days. Music has 
an intrinsic connection to 
time, history and memory, 
and regardless of how great a 
track or album might be, every 
individual who gives them a 
listen will naturally tie the 
emotional experience to their 
explicit memory at the time.

Every year, I create a new 

note on my phone where I jot 
down every album I at least 
enjoyed listening to, and I can 
always tell which ones most 
greatly affected me by the 
power of the memory tied to it. 
Lorde’s masterful Melodrama, 
an obvious entry, calls to 
mind the night I literally 
ran back to my apartment 
at midnight to rendezvous 
with my friends and listen to 
it for the first time; my jaw 
hit the floor during the sonic 
transition in “Hard Feelings/
Loveless,” 
and 
“Supercut” 

brought tears to my eyes due 
to its pop perfection. Brand 
New’s Science Fiction knocked 
me on my ass as the longtime 
fan in me devoured every nook 
and cranny of the album, only 
to have my heart shattered by 

sexual misconduct allegations 
against the band’s frontman. 
As the new year approaches, 
this rollercoaster of emotions 
has become an occurrence as 
natural as the changing of the 
seasons.

The worst part of it all is 

finding out which releases 
were 
heinously 
overlooked 

by major music publications 
(Rolling Stone, Consequence 
of 
Sound, 
Pitchfork, 
etc.) 

whose lists can range from 
frustratingly 
comical 
to 

almost 
perfect. 
Beautiful 

albums that were destined 
for major attention include 
Paramore’s After Laughter and 
St. 
Vincent’s 
Masseduction 

— they’re artists who have 
deservingly made a name for 
themselves to wide audiences 
— but my heart can’t help but 
break for The Menzingers’s 
After 
The 
Party, 
a 
damn 

near perfect reflection on 
adulthood and aging. I ached 
alongside the humanism of 
Mt. Eerie’s A Crow Looked 
at Me and Phoebe Bridgers’s 
Stranger in the Alps, albums 
whose lyrical content is as 
intimate as their compositions 
are astoundingly unique. The 

Maine’s Lovely Little Lonely 
and Oso Oso’s The Yunahon 
Mixtape were two of the best 
rock albums I’ve heard in 
recent memory, only to be 
overlooked in lieu of bigger 
names.

Despite their lack of critical 

attention, these are albums 
I’ll cherish for years to come, 
affecting 
me 
in 
different 

ways throughout the course 
of this year. As I write this, 
I fondly reflect on the music 
that made 2017 special for 
me: screaming along with my 
friends to “Black Butterflies 
and Déjà Vu” at The Maine’s 
headlining show in Pontiac; 
watching Oso Oso play to 50 
kids in a basement; moshing 
to “Tellin’ Lies” during The 
Menzingers’s 
set 
at 
Riot 

Fest. Without regard to their 
media attention, this music 
will indelibly mark the way I 
experienced the past year.

Every year has its highs 

and lows regardless of the 
music released, and 2017 has 
undeniably been a tumultuous 
year politically and socially. 
But it’s also a blessing to be 
saturated with such incredible 
music over such a short period 
of time. Music that keeps 
us grounded and nostalgic, 
comforted 
and 
thoughtful 

— music that ranges from 
powerfully 
political 
to 

emotionally groundbreaking. 
So 
every 
December 
I’ll 

continue 
my 
ritual 
of 

reflection 
and 
growth, 

staying thankful for all the 
new releases, both good and 
bad, that carried me through 
another year.

FILMRISE

A tag team of Nickelodeon and Disney Channel stars in a not-too-bad film
‘My Friend Dahmer’ both 
an origin story & biopic

The adaptation craftily unveils a tale of murder and horror

There is something morbidly 

fascinating about getting inside 
the mind of a serial killer, about 
plunging into a twisted psyche 
of macabre impulses. Trying 
to 
understand 
something 

completely beyond the moral 
scope of most people is an 
impossible task, but “My Friend 
Dahmer” attempts to do just 
that. The film works as both 
an origin story and an eerie 
portrait of Jeffrey Dahmer, 
chronicling his last year in 
high school as it attempts to 

understand how his early life 
contributed to his infamy as a 
serial killer and cannibal.

“My Friend Dahmer” doesn’t 

necessarily probe the mind of 
Jeffrey Dahmer as much as 
follow him around. His most 
intimate 
desires 
are 
alien 

to us, but are hinted at in a 
slow and eerie progression of 
moments. Dahmer is largely 
a tragically lonely figure who 
is ostracized at school and 
neglected at home. We see him 
spending hours on end in his 
lab, dissolving roadkill in acid 
and indulging his fascination 
with bones. We also see him 
trying to get the attention 
he craves by “spazzing,” or 
imitating bouts of epilepsy in 
disturbingly prolonged scenes. 
Dahmer’s place as an outcast 
humanizes him, and while 
his foray into the grotesque 
is unsettling, he appears as 
a 
misunderstood 
character 

deserving of sympathy.

The film is an adaptation of 

the graphic novel of the same 
name by John ‘Derf’ Backderf, 
the 
real-life 
character 
that 

befriends 
Dahmer. 
Played 

well by Alex Wolff (“Patriot’s 
Day”), 
Derf 
is 
intrigued 

by 
Dahmer’s 
spazzing 
and 

welcomes him within the ranks 
of his prankster friends group, 
heralding him as the class 
clown. 
With 
Derf, 
Dahmer 

finds the companionship he 
desperately 
needs. 
But 
the 

film is careful to sprinkle in 
red flags that shatter Derf’s 
innocent view of Dahmer and 
hint at something more sinister 
and dangerous. The film does 
an incredible job at navigating 
moments of implicit tension, 
coloring a sixth sense where 
you know something isn’t quite 
right and creating fear from that 
tension. “My Friend Dahmer” 
explores the dynamics between 
people and the gravity behind 
the social scene of high school.

The 
undeniable 
backbone 

of the film is Ross Lynch’s 

(“Teen 
Beach 
Movie”) 

portrayal 
of 
Dahmer. 
The 

former Disney Channel star 
is wholly unrecognizable as 
the 
shuffling, 
hunch-backed 

and hooded-eyed outcast who 

moves like a clunky shadow. 
Lynch communicates Dahmer’s 
bottled 
homosexuality 
with 

grace, 
showing 
his 
lustful 

fantasies 
of 
the 
neighbor 

with just the right dash of 
eeriness that hints at his later 
masochistic 
sexual 
desires. 

There’s a sense of entropy 
to 
Dahmer’s 
existence; 
his 

impulses and fantasies escalate 
uncontrollably, and he cannot 
find his way back to the simple 
reality of the other boys. There’s 
a sense of relatability there, in 
fighting to quell desires that 
ultimately win, but there is an 
overarching mystery that the 
film doesn’t try to explain.

The 
movie 
doesn’t 
make 

excuses for Dahmer, who would 
go on to infamously murder and 
eat seventeen people. Many 
scenes feature him excessively 
drinking, butchering animals 
and rubbing their bones. “My 
Friend Dahmer” isn’t trying 
to argue that he could have 
been saved had his friends and 
parents paid more attention. 
The movie merely wants to get 
inside the mind of a serial killer 
and humanize him, exploring 
the factors that contributed to 
the actions of one of the world’s 
most infamous killers.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

BOOK REVIEW

SYDNEY COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

Every year has its 

highs and lows 
regardless of the 
music released

Recent ‘They Can’t Kill Us’ 
explores music & identity 

Hanif Abdurraqib’s essay 

collection “They Can’t Kill 
Us Until They Kill Us” is as 
expansive in scope as it is rich 
in content. Abdurraqib is a 
music writer, but his subjects 
— sonic landscapes, fandoms 
and 
performance 
— 
are 

only his starting points. His 
writing is alive and breathing, 
criticism infused with stories, 
lived experience and emotion. 
For Abdurraqib, it’s never just 
a song, never just an artist; 
music is a lens through which 
he sees the whole world.

Life, 
death, 
music, 

loneliness, 
media, 
politics 

and 
love 
are 
necessarily 

intertwined 
in 
his 
work, 

because 
he’s 
striving 
for 

something bigger than a book 
of thinkpieces. He weaves 
together personal narrative 
and rigorous critical thought 
so 
naturally 
you 
almost 

forget that these ideas are 
ever 
considered 
separate 

methods of writing. His book 
does the extraordinary work 
of capturing a moment in 
time, piecing together the 
fragments of life and death in 
modern America.

“They Can’t Kill Us Until 

They Kill Us” is itself a phrase 
from a sign plastered to a 
Michael 
Brown 
memorial. 

The title serves as an informal 
thesis to Abdurraqib’s work, 
which grapples intently with 
what it means to be Black and 
alive in 2017. A lot of the time, 
it comes down to this: “It’s 
summer and there is a video 
again,” he writes. “A black 
person is dead on camera 
again.” For him, survival is a 
delicate and precious thing, 
not a given.

Abdurraqib isn’t able to 

separate his love of the music 
from this fundamental fact 

of his life, and it shapes his 
perspective and his criticism 
because, as he puts it, “Once 
you understand that there are 
people who do not want you to 

exist, that is a difficult card to 
remove from the table ... there 
is no undoing that knowledge.”

There’s a piece about a 

Bruce 
Springsteen 
concert 

Abdurraqib attended the day 
after seeing Michael Brown’s 
memorial, 
he 
contemplates 

the way Springsteen’s music 
operates on a narrative of 
survival. He writes: “What 
it must feel like to imagine 
that no one in America will be 
killed while a man sings a song 
about the promise of living.” 
It’s a harrowing observation, 
but it’s evocative of the way 
Abdurraqib 
so 
precisely 

articulates 
the 
nuance 
of 

the 
intersection 
between 

identity and experience. It 
lends credence to the idea 
that 
Abdurraqib’s 
Bruce 

Springsteen is not my Bruce 
Springsteen is not your Bruce 
Springsteen. 
But 
that 
just 

makes 
Bruce 
Springsteen 

better — and more interesting.

His range is impressive: 

He writes about everyone 
from Carly Rae Jepsen to 
Prince, Schoolboy Q to The 
Wonder Years, Future to My 
Chemical Romance. It’s clear 
he has a wholehearted love 
of the music, in all the times 
it’s pulled him back from the 
brink. Music isn’t a catch-all 
cure for the heartbreak and 
the fear, but it’s powerful 
nonetheless. 
“The 
great 

mission of any art that revolves 
around place is the mission of 
honesty,” he writes. For him, 
music and art exist with the 
purpose of being as honest as 
possible — so they’re a way of 
making sense of the world, his 
life, his very survival.

Abdurraqib uncovers some 

truths of his own in “They 
Can’t Kill Us Until They 
Kill Us,” peeling back the 
layers of a performance, a 
moment in time or a feeling 
to find the core of it, what it 
really means. It’s a beautiful, 
carefully layered book, full 
of sharp insights, carefully 
realized emotions and stories 
told with a gentle voice that 
grows ever more important in 
these times. And in the vein of 
complete honesty: I hope he 
never stops writing.

Personal Statement: I don’t know how to write this

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | DECEMBER 6, 2017

Editor’s note: The author of this piece remains 

anonymous to protect their identity.
I 

don’t know how to write this article.

I have been trying to write it for hours, for 

weeks, for months, for years now, but every 
time I sit down to write this article, my words 

jumble, my brain shuts down, and my page stays blank.

I don’t know how to write this article, but I know I 

want to. And I think I have to.

It’s not because I don’t know what to say. It’s because I 

have too much to tell. I want to write a lot of things. How 
I still remember the filthy bathroom in his house. How 
that visceral image — of that grimy, dirty bathroom — is 
what, strangely, haunts me most. I want to write about 
how it’s ironic that I watched “Spring Awakening,” hours 
before, because the musical is about a loss of innocence. 
I want to write about when, a few weeks after, I had a 
sip of hard cider and how that single sip was met with a 
sharp pain in my gut and wet tears on my cheeks. How I 
ran to the bathroom after that sip and experienced what 
would be the first of countless panic attacks, as I fought 
off flashbacks I didn’t want to remember.

I want to write about how big the needle looked at 

University Health Services, and how alone I felt when 
the nurse pressed that sharp, long pin into my left butt 
cheek. How I laughed nervously when she told me the 
shot was to counteract HIV, since there was no way of 
knowing if I’d been exposed or not.

How I can’t walk down East University Avenue 

without remembering that we stopped on the street in 
his car that night, and how I wish I could remember why 
I didn’t get out and run.

How I don’t know why, but thinking about coconut 

water makes me sick, because it brings back a hazy image 
of something — something I think might be important 
but can’t quite place. Thinking about coconut water 
invites a faint, fuzzy memory of a dark room that I can 
see and I can hear — but everything is distorted and 
nothing makes sense.

I want to write about how I ate at Frita Batidos after 

going to the police station with my mother, and it is only 
years later that I realize how hard that day must have 
been for her. How I’m grateful of the care she took with 
me, how watchful she was as I ate my burger. How before 
I went to speak with the officer, she pressed a small 
ceramic token in my hand and told me it was full of love. 
How I’d laughed at the sappiness of her actions, when 

only now I realize she was doing everything she could 
and knew it would never be enough.

How after my mother took me to the police station, I 

received a text from my father telling me how much he 
loved me and how sorry he was for me. How it broke my 
heart to read it. How I wished my father had never found 
out what had happened to his daughter.

I want to write how grateful I am for the friends who 

recognized I was hurting and stuck by my side. How 
my roommate checked to make sure I got out of bed in 
the morning. How they religiously ensured I never had 
to sit in the front seat of an Uber. How they threw me a 
surprise 20th birthday party and how I thought it was 
because they wanted to, but now, I realize it was because 
they needed to. How they watched me carefully two 
years ago and watch me carefully today. How they know 
I’m broken but still want to be my friend.

There’s the story of my first therapist, who asked why 

I didn’t feel guiltier about what happened. Asked why I 
was surprised, because I was drunk and alone that night, 
and I shouldn’t have put myself in that position. How, 
though she never outwardly said the words, she thought 
it was my fault and I should think it was too.

How I was “fine” for a while, but was never really OK. 

How I spent a year and a half having meaningless sex 
with whoever paid the slightest bit of attention. How 
I desperately grasped at any semblance of normalcy 
and how I gave up my self-worth in the process. How I 
convinced myself I didn’t need intimacy or affection.

How I learned not to trust anyone. How people will 

disappoint you. How I learned that no one wants to talk 
about what happened. How it makes them uncomfortable. 
How people distance themselves from what scares them. 
How they’ll live normal lives and mine will be anything 
but. How easy it is to believe no one cares if you’re dead 
or alive.

I want to write that I can’t connect with the women 

coming forward in Hollywood and on Facebook, and 
how I feel ashamed for it. How those stories make me 
feel worse. That my experience is both minimized and 
heightened by this barrage of revelations. That it doesn’t 
help knowing I’m not alone in my struggle because I 
never thought I was. That I am glad it will benefit women 
in the future, but selfishly, I am bitter it will not change 
a thing for me.

How the Friday of the third week of November is the 

hardest day because that’s when it happened to me.

How I wonder if he thinks of it too, and if he feels 

guilty. If he knows what he did was wrong. I wonder if 
he has a family now, or a wife, or a girlfriend, or a job. I 
wonder where he lives. I wonder what he reads. I wonder 
what he does on the weekends. I wonder if he wonders.

I think about what I’d say if I saw him. I think about 

it and my stomach tightens and I start to shake. I think 
about how I’d ask if he remembers me, and tell him that 
what he did was sick, and wrong, and evil, and remind 
him that I was 19 and he was 35 and I was a drunk kid 
going home and he was an adult who was supposed to 
get me there. I think about how I’d ask if he drugged me, 
because I wonder every day and know I’ll never know. 
I think about how I’d tell him all of the things he took 
away from me. I think about how I’d tell him I’m scared 
of everything. I think about how I’d tell him I have 
panic attacks in bars and restaurants and in class and 
with friends and during sex and when I’m sleeping and 
when I’m walking and when I’m thinking and when I’m 
breathing.

I think about how I’d tell him all of this, and then I 

think about how I’d punch him in the face.

I want to write that I am very broken, and have PTSD, 

and will probably always be a little bit not OK. I want 
to write that I am not just a victim or a survivor or an 
anecdote or a statistic. I want to write that I am a person. 
A living, breathing, person. I want to write that I’m 
proud of who I’ve become in spite of it all.

I don’t want to write about what happened, because I 

can’t. I can’t write about what happened, because I don’t 
remember. I won’t write about what happened, because 
that’s not what defines the past two years of my life.

What defines the past two years is a mess of high and 

low, of good and bad, of pain and pleasure. What defines 
the past two years is learning to depend on my parents. 
What defines the past two years is the darkness pushing 
me to give up and the light urging me to fight. What 
defines the past two years is an experience that taught 
me life is short, and things can change in a moment. 
What defines the past two years is that there’s many 
more to come.

I have been trying to write this article for two years. 

For two years, I have fallen short. For two years, I could 
not write about what happened because to write this 
article would be to accept what happened to me as real.

I wanted to write that two years ago I was raped, but I 

just didn’t know how to write this article.

Soundtracking: Sex

I 

know what you’re thinking. What does 
a column-writing, grandma-sweater-
wearing kid who looks like the offspring 

of Woody Allen in “Annie Hall” and a cold bowl 
of clam chowder know about sex?

Long answer: Not very much, but I have drive 

and charisma and maybe an OK personality so 
that should make up for something.

Short answer: jack shit.
But what I do know is the road to sexual 

discovery (as if I’ve reached it yet) is paved 
with the most awkward experiences known 
to humankind. If I had to guess, I’d say the 
neanderthals would have appreciated the 
condom-on-the-banana lesson as much as I did 
if it was offered to them.

Very few big-budget blockbusters paint sex as 

I experienced it the first go-arounds. In movies, 
sex is passionate. It’s intense. It’s got “Take my 
Breath Away” by Berlin in the background like 
in “Top Gun.” Sex never includes your inner 
monologue of “Should this be doing that? 
Why am I hungry all of a sudden? Did I leave 
the kitchen sink running after washing dishes 
today?” in movies.

But we’re here to explore that side of the 

beautiful and painstaking experience that is 
learning about and living through losing your 
virginity. If I have to recount every moment 
leading up to that climax (or lack thereof), so be 
it. That is a sacrifice I am willing to make. I did 
this for you. Please don’t make me regret this.

“Let’s Talk About Sex” — Salt-N-Pepa
Just to be clear, I am not recommending you 

get down and dirty to the early-’90s drum beats 
of Salt-N-Pepa (unless that’s your thing — don’t 
knock it till you’ve tried it, I guess).

Where to start? In the very poignant and 

calculated words of Julie Andrews in “The 
Sound of Music,” “Let’s start at the very 
beginning, a very good place to start.”

The year is 2010. I’m in seventh grade and 

I think I know more about thermonuclear 
dynamics than I do about sex. I had just started 
dating my middle school girlfriend, whom I had 
asked out by sending her a green carnation for 
St. Patrick’s Day through a school fundraiser. 
On the note attached to the carnation written in 
my second-grader-esque handwriting: “I’d be 
so LUCKY if you went out with me.”

Yeah, I was a hopeless romantic. How the 

hell did I not know what sex was? I should 
have been the Wilt Chamberlain of my school 
district.

Well, in the classiest fashion, I took my 

new girlfriend to a middle school dance called 
Teen Night. It was held the first Friday of 
every month in the auditorium of the local 
community education center. There was a DJ, 
disco balls and pizza. Our parents dropped 
us off separately and we met at the door. We 
walked into the dance floor and I heard a song. 
To this day, I still believe it is the most beautiful 
song I have ever heard. A ballad of passion and 
romance with the lyrics rivaling the greatest 
works of Walt Whitman and Shakespeare.

“BedRock” — Young Money
“My room is the G-spot, call me Mr. 

Flintstone, I can make your bed rock.”

But what does it mean? I get the Flintstone 

thing. I watched a lot of Boomerang as a kid. 
But what in the wide, wide world of sports is a 
G-spot and why is his bed rocking? Is he having 
a nightmare or something? Sorry you aren’t 
sleeping well!

That was my thought process.
Flash forward to junior year of high school. 

My previous seventh grade flame and I had 
since broken up. The end of an era, honestly. A 
power couple that rivals rivaled Kimye’s star 
status.

By junior year, I had stopped wearing two 

different plaid patterns at once, but I wasn’t 
(and still am not) a stunner by any means. You 
could tell by the way I walked that I hadn’t had 
sex yet. In high school, sex is like a participation 
trophy. No one ever says the title means 
anything or if you actually did anything well. 
We just assume it was amazing because you got 
a trophy. As messed up as it sounds, high school 
is full of the worst gremlins you can imagine.

“You haven’t had sex yet? You’ll get there 

someday.”

I looked and felt like a dweebier Ken doll. 

Nothing below the belt.

“Like a Virgin” — Madonna
It was time to pull myself up by my 

bootstraps. I’ve always been an OK student. 
Whatever I need to learn, I study and study 
until my confidence rockets through the roof. 
Eventually, I come back down to reality once 
I realize how screwed I am when the exam 
comes but the confidence keeps me going. The 
same goes for learning about sex. Movies were 
no help. I only had one hope.

I’ll just say it.
There’s a Google search saved somewhere 

from my first time searching “porn” on my 
computer.

“Wet Dreamz” — J. Cole

Porn was my Mr. Miyagi. Whacks on, whacks 

off. (No more, I swear.)

I’ll spare you the long and arduous details 

but after emerging from my studies, I was ready 
to take on the world. I knew everything. The 
secrets of the world were open to me. I looked 
like Rocky entering the ring, overconfident and 
jumping around like an idiot.

A few months later, I was driving around in 

my 2004 Chevy Malibu with a girl I had been 
talking to. She goes to a different school, you 
wouldn’t know her. I knew she didn’t want to 
date but she was still talking to me which was 
definitely new so I thought something might 
happen. We didn’t have a destination. I didn’t 

know what she wanted and wasn’t about to 
try and guess. I’d rather drive to Ohio and back 
than make a wrong move.

My hands were starting to get clammy. 

My foot was tapping incessantly. My months 
of training didn’t leave me with a very good 
amount of control over my hormones and I was 
wearing skinny jeans so I basically wanted to 
end my life at that exact moment.

“Why Don’t We Do It In The Road?” — The 

Beatles

I wasted about three-quarters of a tank of gas 

driving around until I worked up the nerves to 
find some abandoned parking lot to stop in. My 
phone was at 6 percent from shuffling through 
every playlist I had ever created. I turned down 
the music a little bit and looked over to her. 
Then she leaped forward, grabbed my face 
and kissed me.

My entire face turned red. What is going 

on? This is new. This isn’t like my first kiss 
at the roller rink with that aforementioned 
seventh-grade girlfriend. I was incredibly 
sweaty.

Not just because I had been waiting for 

this since I started my training regiment, but 
because the air conditioning in my car was 
busted and we turned the engine off so no one 
knew we were here. It was basically a sauna.

“Hot in Herre” — Nelly
In movies, when characters are having 

sex in a steamy place like a car or shower or 
anything of that sorts and one character puts 
their hand against the glass, leaving a lustful 
handprint, you always assume it’s because 
the sex is so amazing, you need to hold on 
to something. You never assume it’s because 
it’s 120 DEGREES IN THIS HELLHOLE 
AND YOU’RE LIKE A DOG TRYING TO 
BREAK OUT OF THE BACKSEAT ON A 
SCORCHING SUMMER DAY.

I basically looked like I just got out of 

the pool in the least sexy way possible. But 
nonetheless, I was in no way complaining. 
She was leading every step of the way, which 
was kind of a dent to the large amounts of 
confidence I had built up over the course of 
my sexual awakening, but it would do.

I knew exactly what to do and how to sound 

and what noises to make from my dialogue 
studies. I had all the moves memorized. 
Nothing could go wrong.

“You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want 

(When You’re Makin’ Love)” — Avenue Q Cast

Except everything. Everything can go 

wrong.

Avenue Q lied to me. When you’re 

almost touching your toes, cramped and 
uncomfortable in the backseat of a 2004 
Chevy Malibu, you can most definitely cannot 
be as loud as the hell you want.

At the same time, nothing felt like I 

assumed it would from the hours (yeah 
I’m man enough to say hours) of porn I had 
watched in preparation. I kept thinking it 
should be different and eventually, my mind 
started to wander. I kept thinking about 
how we say the last word in some acronyms 
twice (like how we say PIN number when 
the N already stands for number) and how 
Jaden Smith in the Karate Kid remake wore 
a Detroit Lions shirt in China. This is not 
what everyone at school said sex was like. I 
was getting a participation trophy but batting 
.000 for the season.

“Rock You Like a Hurricane” — Scorpions
It was much more like a thunderstorm 

than a hurricane: inconvenient for everyone 
involved if you had other plans but not a 
complete waste of time if you need something 
to do.

I dropped her off back home and eventually 

just didn’t talk anymore. It’s not like we had 
“The Notebook” level of sexual intimacy and I 
am 99 percent confident neither of us would be 
writing home about our time together (I know 
it’s an expression but please don’t write home 
about your sexual encounters; I know I’m kind 
of doing it here, but I am far from a role model).

Though I’m not a perfect example, I’d make 

a bet that everyone’s first time was not some 
magical explosion of hormones and rainbows. 
If it was, lucky you — but also, does it really 
matter? Everyone figures it out eventually. No 
pressure.

DESIGN BY OLIVIA STILLMAN


A

fter being sexually assaulted 
before 
college, 
an 
LSA 

freshman who prefers to 
remain anonymous due to the 

sensitive nature of her experience, was not 
aware of the resources available to her. The 
sex education class she took in high school 
hadn’t prepared her.

“The experience itself — it’s unlike 

anything you can really describe. It’s 
demoralizing. It’s dehumanizing. You feel 
disgusting,” she said

Growing up in a conservative and rural 

area of Michigan, she said her only high 
school sex education was an hourlong 
presentation, which dodged the topic of sex 
entirely and excluded her queer identity 
from the narrative.

“We got an hourlong class period about 

abstinence and STDs, and that was it,” she 
said. “In a period of time when I really 
would’ve needed it, I didn’t have the 
education about resources or even that my 
experience was valid, and that’s definitely a 
big thing that could change.”

When she arrived at the University of 

Michigan this fall, she, along with all first-
year students, underwent the required 
Relationship Remix workshop. This was 
her first formal exposure to the concepts of 
sexual consent, communication and sexual 
assault education.

Relationship 
Remix 
gave 
her 
the 

validation she needed to stop blaming 
herself for her experience, and it did so in 
an inclusive manner. 

“Relationship Remix honestly was the 

sexual education class I wish I would’ve 
gotten when I was a freshman in high 
school … it didn’t really discriminate even 
though a lot of sex education classes in 
high schools do, and it’s because they’re 
very heteronormative,” she said. “And then 
in terms of sexual assault, Relationship 
Remix, 
it 
almost 
seemed 
like 
the 

understood and they cared.”

In an email to The Daily, Laura 

McAndrew, a University sexual health 
educator, emphasized the importance of 
personal empowerment in sex education.

“In Relationship Remix, we focus on 

promoting healthy relationship behaviors 
like knowing your values, defining what 
you do and don’t want in a relationship, 
communication, consent, and sexual health 
promotion,” McAndrew wrote. “There’s 
not just one approach that will promote 
sexual health; we’re complex creatures, 

and different individuals and communities 
will each have unique needs and interests.”

*****
With regard to sexual education, the 

state of Michigan mandates only the 
instruction of HIV and AIDS safety, 
delegating significant authority to local 
districts. For districts that do opt to offer 
more comprehensive sex education, the 
state-mandated curriculum is loosely 
defined 
and 
hardly 
exhaustive. 
It’s 

intended to provide control to local school 
boards. Under this decentralized model, 
parents have a right to review sex education 

and HIV/AIDS curriculum 
materials and can excuse their children 
without penalty.

The result is an inconsistent patchwork 

across the state. Students in different 
school districts are taught about sex 
in dramatically different ways, with 
a 
particularly 
contentious 
divide 

surrounding the issue of abstinence.

Under 
Michigan 
Department 
of 

Education guidelines, all public school 
sex educations programs “must stress that 
abstinence from sex is a responsible and 
effective method of preventing unplanned 
or out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and that 
it is the only protection that is 100% 
effective against unplanned pregnancy, 
sexually transmitted disease, and sexually 
transmitted HIV infection and AIDS.” 

Michigan is one of 26 states that require 
abstinence be stressed as a part of sex 
education; 11 others require that it be 
covered.

Absent from the guidelines are any 

discussion of sexual orientation and gender 
identity or clinical abortion. Nine states 
require the discussion of sexual orientation 
be inclusive of LGBT individuals, and 
three states require only negative, or 
discriminatory, information on sexual 
orientation.

Abstinence-only sex education has 

attracted much scrutiny, with a report 

published in the Journal of Adolescent 
Health finding abstinence education often 
fails to prevent adolescents from having 
sex.

The 
report 
concluded 
that 
when 

adolescents who receive abstinence-only 
education have sex, they are less likely to 
use contraceptives than those who received 
instruction on contraception.

The 
federally 
funded 
Michigan 

Abstinence Program provides abstinence 
education to schools that apply for its grant. 
Currently there are nine grantees. Carrie 
Tarry, acting director for the state Division 
of Child and Adolescent Health, attributed 
decreases in teenage pregnancies to a 
combination of abstinence-based and 
contraceptive sexual education programs.

“There are a variety of factors that 

influence the teen pregnancy rate and 
I think are responsible for some of the 
dramatic decreases we’ve seen over the 
past 20 years,” Tarry said. “Certainly, 
access to contraceptives is one of them, (as 
well as) our evidence-based approach or 
evidence-informed education.”

*****
School districts are allowed under state 

law to bring outside groups to teach sex 
education.

Until 2015, an outside group — Sexually 

Mature Aware Responsible Teens — taught 
part of the sex education curriculum in 
the East Lansing School District, before 
attracting 
significant 
controversy 
for 

their focus on abstinence — an issue some 
community members attributed to the 
group’s religious affiliations. 

That year, Alice Dreger, a former 

professor of clinical medical humanities 
and bioethics at Northwestern University, 
took advantage of a policy that allows 
parents to attend sex education classes. 
She attended her son’s ninth-grade class 
and live-tweeted it.

“‘Sex is part of a terrible lifestyle,’” 

Dreger said instructors told students. 
“‘Drugs, unemployment, failure to finish 
school — sex is part of the disaster’”

In a separate portion of the workshop, 

instructors assigned numbers to students, 
then rolled dice to simulate the chance of 
condom failure and unintended pregnancy, 
Dreger said.

“‘We are going to roll this dice 

eight times,’” Dreger attributed to the 
instructors. “‘Every time your number 
comes up, in pretend your condom failed 
and you get a paper baby.’”

Daniel Kaplowitz, a current student at 

East Lansing High School, recalled the 
event in an email to The Daily. He said 
the negative publicity Dreger’s tweets 
garnered ultimately pressured the district 
to remove SMART from participating in 
the sex education curriculum.

“Until 2015, an outside, religiously-

funded group was a regular guest speaker 
in sex ed classes at ELHS, and they used 
pseudo- and un-scientific information to 
create an atmosphere of fear and confusion 
around sex in hopes of pressuring students 
into choosing abstinence,” Kaplowitz 
wrote.

Another such group is Crossroads Care 

Center, which, through the Sexual Health

and Relationship Education program, 
teaches in 51 school districts in Oakland 
County.

SHARE Director Evelyn Van Sloten said 

her organization offers middle school, high 
school and in some cases an elementary 
school program.

“The program is a sexual risk avoidance 

program so that is the emphasis, which 
is for optimal sexual health, is the way 
to have the proper mindset in order to 
encourage young people to make the 
healthiest choices,” Van Sloten said.

The 
program 
facilitators 
discuss 

things 
like 
HIV/STD 
transmission, 

contraceptives and sexual assault.

Typically, the programs supplement 

in-class instruction. According to Van 
Sloten, SHARE must first meet with 
health 
teachers, 
then 
the 
districts’ 

health advisory committee and then the 
school board, which has the final say 
over whether it is able to participate in 
classroom instruction.

While the program’s website shows 

that after students go through it they are 
more likely to say it is more important to 
them to wait until marriage to have sex, 
Van Sloten said the SHARE program 
differs from other programs in that the 
instructors are certified by a sexual risk-
avoidance program, which takes a more 
holistic approach to sex education.

“The typical abstinence program would 

be one that would basically highlight what 
the issues are and basically it’s a just a 
‘say no’ program, which is actually the 
healthiest choice, but an SRA program, 
it comes out of a national organization 
called Ascend, and that is a program 
where our instructors are certified,” Van 
Sloten said. “It’s an understanding of all 
of the components that make a person up, 
whether it’s their physical, their social or 
environmental or relationship aspects.”

In September 2017, Forest Hills School 

District in Grand Rapids decided to end its 
abstinence-only curriculum and to begin 
allowing certified Forest Hills teachers to 
teach sex education. Local parents told the 
local Fox affiliate they felt the abstinence-
only program was unrealistic and lacking.

For 15 years, the Pregnancy Resource 

Center taught and developed the curriculum 
for sex education classes in Grand Rapids. 
Despite many blaming the Pregnancy 
Resource Center, the president of the group, 
Jim Sprague, told Fox 17 West Michigan it 
was only following district rules.

“It was Forest Hills solely who asked 

us not to teach from the abstinence-based 
plan,” Sprague said. “We couldn’t even utter 
the word ‘condom’ in the classrooms. That 
is what we were instructed to do for the last 
15 years.”

*****
In the wake of many recent celebrity 

sexual assault allegations, and the rise of the 
online #MeToo solidarity movement, many 
believe it is time to begin addressing these 
problems early on with students.

One such Michigan resident, Wendy 

Sellers, a registered nurse who helped 
author a recent report on the state of health 
education in Michigan, told Michigan Radio 
in October that she views sex education as 
crucial to preventing sexual assault.

“We need to start young because these 

types of behaviors begin at a young age and 
continue into adulthood,” Sellers said. “And 
so, one of the answers to these issues is 
educating young people about what healthy 
relationships look like and how to develop 
the skills to have healthy relationships, as 
well as what to do to intervene if a person 
is the object of sexual harassment or sexual 
assault.”

At the policy level, legislators have 

sought to amend parts of the sex education 
curriculum, specifically redefining how 
sexual assault is covered and the requirement 
of medically accurate information. Last 
month, state Sen. Curtis Hertel, Jr., D-East 
Lansing, proposed what he called “yes 
means yes” legislation. The law would shift 
the sex education curriculum to include 
conversations about defining affirmative 
consent. State Sen. Hoon-Yung Hopgood, 
D-Taylor, proposed a bill that would require 
schools that teach sex education to teach 
medically accurate information.

“Research continues to show that 

comprehensive 
sex 
education, 
which 

teaches both abstinence and contraception, 
is most effective for young people,” Hopgood 
wrote in a press release. “Youth who receive 
this kind of education are more likely to 
initiate sexual activity later in life and use 
protection correctly and consistently when 
they do become sexually active.”

The new legislation will cast equal 

responsibility on men in preventing sexual 
assault, Hertel said.

“For example, my daughter will be taught 

her entire life, how not to dress, to walk in lit 
places, not to put down her drink and leave 
it unattended; she’ll be taught to carry Mace 
or pepper spray, but the boys in her class will 
never be taught not to be perpetrators.”

Kaplowitz, also a member of the Sex 

Education Advisory Board in his school 
district, wrote that abstinence isn’t effective 
in creating sexually healthy students.

“Districts and states where abstinence 

is centered end up with students having 
sex at no lower a rate, but due to a lack 
of information about contraception and 
safer sex, rates of pregnancy and STI are 
significantly higher,” Kaplowitz wrote. “Of 
course abstinence is the only 100% effective 
method, but the real result of mandating 
this be the core of our sex ed curriculum is 
not abstinent students, but uninformed, and 
therefore less safe students.”

Yet currently, the state continues to put the 

majority of sex ed decision-making power 
on local authorities, which contributes to 
often confusing and retrograde lessons in 
the classroom.

“We have a responsibility to teach 

people to have basic respect for each other 
and their bodies,” Hertel said. “I think 
this is a cultural shift that needs to happen 
and I think this bill helps us get there.”

down and the twinkly holiday lights came on. The annual KindleFest Market, 

or Christkindlmarkt as it is known in Germany, brought together food, 

holiday deals and Santa for a night of holiday celebrations.
