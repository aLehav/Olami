The University of Michigan 
announced on Monday some 
in-person classes will resume 
on all three campuses this fall. 
However, all classes will be 
delivered remotely after Nov. 
20 and fall break is canceled, 
according to an announcement 
from 
University 
President 
Mark Schlissel. The winter 
semester will begin Jan. 19, 
2021, Schlissel wrote in an 
email.
“Thanks to the thoughtful 
and 
deliberate 
efforts 
of 
hundreds of members of the 
U-M community, our cautious 
optimism about the fall has 
coalesced into a path forward,” 
Schlissel wrote. “Their work 
has given me confidence that 
we can do this safely, and 
we will continue to plan and 
prepare in the months ahead. 
We now have the opportunity 
to 
begin 
a 
new 
journey 
together, equipped with the 
very best guidance and ideas 
from our leading scholars, 
innovative students and expert 
staff.”
Other updates to the calendar 
include 
the 
elimination 
of 
spring 
break, 
resulting 
in 

continuous class sessions from 
Jan. 19 to April 20, with finals 
running April 22-29. 
The University launched a 
Campus Maize and Blueprint 
website 
that 
contains 
information 
and 
updates 
regarding reopening for all 
three campuses and Michigan 
Medicine. 
According 
to 
the 
website, 
students 
will 
be expected to wear face 
coverings in public spaces and 
indoor social gatherings are 
limited to 10 people.
For the Ann Arbor campus, 
larger 
lectures 
will 
be 
delivered remotely in the fall. 
Smaller discussions will be 
held in person, and medium-
size classes will be a hybrid of 
the two. Individual schools, 
colleges and departments of 
the University will determine 
these decisions.
According 
to 
the 
announcement, the University 
will open on-campus housing. 
However, there will be social 
distancing 
requirements 
in 
shared spaces and move-in 
times have been extended from 
three days to at least seven. 
For those living on-campus, 
students are expected to self-
quarantine for 14 days before 
moving in. 
Students can expect to have 

a roommate, however are not 
expected to social distance 
within their own rooms. For 
students 
with 
pre-existing 
health conditions, there are 
limited 
single 
rooms 
still 
available, according to the 
website. 
Dining 
halls 
will 
also 
be reopened with reduced 
capacity to accommodate social 
distancing 
requirements. 
Students will have the option 
to 
either 
place 
a 
dine-in 
reservation online or obtain a 
take out meal. 
The University is finalizing 
a 
testing 
protocol 
when 
students arrive on campus 
and throughout the semester. 
Facilities will be set aside for 
students who test positive or 
come in close contact with 
COVID-19 to quarantine.
Planning for the fall semester 
will continue to be guided 
by the advice of medical and 
public health experts, Schlissel 
wrote. In an April 29 interview 
with The Daily, Schlissel said 
the fall semester is unlikely 
to 
be 
normal 
and 
shared 
steps University community 
members might need to take to 
return to campus.

‘U’ announces in-residence 
fall semester, calendar changes

ALEC COHEN/Daily
When incoming Business freshman 
Jessica Goldberg heard University of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 
announcement of a “public health-informed 
in-person fall semester,” she said she was 
ecstatic.
“This wasn’t how I planned for my senior 
year (in high school) to end, and I was really 
looking forward to looking on campus in the 
fall,” Goldberg said. “It’s kind of what I’ve 
envisioned all these years, so I was really 
excited to hear that I would be moving in a 
dorm and being on campus and getting the 
full college experience.”
Goldberg said she places her trust in 
the University administration to take 
appropriate action in the worst case 
scenario, and therefore, does not have 
concerns for the fall semester.
“When coronavirus first started it was 
really scary, and I do think we’re going to 
have to adjust to a new normal,” Goldberg 
said. “But also, there’s also that fact that life 
has to return to some sense of normalcy ... 
You can’t be concerned for the rest of your 
life.” 
In contrast, Art & Design senior Leila 
Mullison said they had mixed feelings after 
hearing the decision. 
“On the one hand, as purely an academic 
student, I don’t love online classes,” 
Mullison said. “I have trouble focusing on 
them and staying in the same place for very 
long periods of time. At the same time, as a 
person who owns a human body, it doesn’t 
feel very good or very safe to be moving 
somewhere right now and to be interacting 
with a bunch of new people and to be living 
in a community environment.”

ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM
michigandaily.com


Over 2,000 people crowded the 
Diag on Friday to celebrate June-
teenth, the day when African slaves 
in Texas were told they were free –– 
two years after the Emancipation 
Proclamation. This event, hosted 
by Survivors Speak and other local 
organizers, aimed to incorporate 
awareness for police brutality into a 
day of celebration.
Event organizer Trische’ Duck-
worth, Survivors Speak founder, 
told The Daily even though June-
teenth is a day of celebrating the 
progress 
in 
America 
towards 
equality, Black people are continu-
ously fighting racism and systemic 
oppression. 
“You think about Juneteenth 
being a celebration, but what are 
we really celebrating? Because 
although we’re free, we’re not real-
ly free,” Duckworth said. “Because 
there are laws that are put in place 
to stop us as melanated folks to have 
freedom and justice for all. So while 
we did want to celebrate and that’s 
why we ended with the dance party, 
we also wanted to focus on what’s 
going on in the world right now and 
how we have to come together as a 
people to fight for justice and use 
it as a call to action and then end it 
with a small, short celebration.”
After an open letter was sent to 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel by School of Education staff 
members to encourage the Univer-
sity to recognize Juneteenth as a 
national holiday in the workplace, 
many schools within the Univer-
sity allowed their staff early dis-
missal to participate in Juneteenth 
events. An email was also sent by 
Robert Sellers, chief diversity offi-
cer and vice provost for equity and 
inclusion, encouraging University 
employees to allow staff to partici-
pate in Juneteenth events. 
Speakers and performers at the 
protest included politicians, Washt-
enaw County residents and local 
artists. 
Former Michigan gubernatorial 
candidate Abdul El-Sayed spoke 

about reaching out against injustice 
and breaking the barriers of a racist 
society. 
“So we see that it’s been 155 years 
since we abolished, finally, the idea 
of (Black people) being concluded as 
part of what was private property,” 
El-Sayed said. “Well we’ve got a lot 
more work to be including Black 
folks … We are here today because 
that work is not over. We are here 
today because as we recognize as we 
stand on the floor of that moment, 
we all better reach out fists up high 
to break the ceiling that tell us that 
Black folks should be excluded, can 
be excluded, could be excluded.”
Eli Savit, Washtenaw County 
prosecutor candidate, talked about 
the school to prison pipeline. Savit 
referenced the book “The New Jim 
Crow,” when discussing how the 
U.S. criminal justice system is the 
modern day slavery that prevents 
Black people from having freedom.
“70 percent of the children in 
our juvenile detention centers are 
black,” Savit said. “Is the school to 
prison pipeline still freedom? And 
freedom does not come about even 
after somebody is released from 
prison or from jail. In the ‘New Jim 
Crow,’ Michelle Alexander made 
the case that we have replaced the 
old Jim Crow, the formal laws in the 
South, for a new Jim Crow in which 
we deny people coming back from 
prison (and) jails the opportunity 
to maintain jobs, to get housing, to 
continue their education.”
Halfway through the march, 
protesters kneeled in front of the 
Ann Arbor Municipal Center for 
eight minutes and 46 seconds to 
commemorate the death of George 
Floyd. Once the crowd reached the 
Diag again, people were dancing 
and celebrating Juneteenth. 
LSA and STAMPS senior Valerie 
Le said people should look into the 
history of America for themselves 
because much of it is whitewashed, 
which is why she never heard of 
Juneteenth before college. 
“I think that people should rec-
ognize that history is so much deep-
er than what we’ve been taught,” Le 
said. “Especially growing up in a 
super white town, I’ve never heard 
of Juneteenth before and (did) not 
learn a lot about Black history. I 
think it’s important to learn about

Thousands march 
in A2 on Juneteenth

The Daily sent reporters 
to 
various 
protests 
across 
Michigan 
throughout 
the 
week. Here are the protests we 
covered.
Breonna Taylor Protest on 
Diag on Sunday, June 14, 2020
About a do0zen community 
members spread across the 
Diag in sleeping bags Sunday to 
honor the memory of Breonna 
Taylor. Taylor, a 26-year-old 
Black woman, was shot and 
killed by a Louisville police 
officer who entered her home 
with a “no-knock warrant” 
in March. The event lasted 
eight hours in remembrance 
of the eight times Taylor was 
shot. Organizers encouraged 
Black protesters to set up their 
sleeping bags in the middle of 
the Diag. Non-Black protesters 
were asked to encircle the 
resting protesters and watch 
for any potential agitators. 
The block “M” in the middle 
of the Diag was covered by a 
blanket. 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Social Work student Dana 
Pittman, Association of Black 
Social Workers member, was 
part of the team that helped 

organize the protest. Pittman 
emphasized that the protest 
on 
the 
Diag 
emphasized 
resting for Black people who 
are fighting racism and to 
symbolize Breonna Taylor’s 
death.
“Today, we really wanted 
to highlight the importance 
of rest and Black rest (and) 
Black bodies. Rest shouldn’t 
be revolutionary, it should 
just be a right,” Pittman said. 
“But sadly, we are not afforded 
that because we always have 
to fight and we always have 
to do the work so we invited 
other people to support us 
in the work so that we didn’t 
have to continuously inform 
them … rest is something we 
really (want) to center in this 
protest.”
Social Work student Leslie 
Tetteh, Association of Black 
Social Workers member, also 
helped organize the protest. 
Tetteh told The Daily being 
active in dismantling racism 
can be tiring and taxing on 
Black people who constantly 
experience prejudice and they 
are doing the best they can 
when it seems more violence is 
continuing to occur. 
“For 
me, 
what’s 
been 
difficult is the overwhelming 
feeling of what we’re doing,” 
Tetteh said. “I think that we 
all are very active in terms 
of 
everything 
that’s 
going 
on (and) making sure we

Different events 
throughout the week 
call attention to BLM

Over 2,000 people 
gathered on the Diag to 
celebrate June 19


Alec Gallimore, University of 
Michigan dean of engineering, 
and Laura Blake Jones, dean of 
students, held a town hall with 
various student groups involved in 
plans for the upcoming school year 
on Monday afternoon following 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel’s announcement regarding fall 
semester earlier in the day.
After walking through informa-
tion presented in Schlissel’s email 
and the new website, Gallimore and 
Jones answered student inquiries 
in an event moderated by Public 
Policy senior Amanda Kaplan, Cen-
tral Student Government president.
The town hall was primar-
ily intended for the more than 600 
students involved in the COVID-
19 Campus Challenge, a student-
created competition to brainstorm 
solutions for various problems that 
may arise in the fall. Kaplan said 
students in the Campus Climate 
Advisory Council, a group of about 
40 students from various boards, 
organizations and student employ-
ee groups advising on fall planning, 
were also invited.
In an email to The Daily, Jones 
wrote the town hall was meant to 
highlight key elements of Schlis-
sel’s announcement as well as to 
continue seeking input from chal-
lenge participants.
“The 
Challenge 
participants 
are a large representative group of 
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents from a wide variety of schools 
and colleges,” Jones wrote. “Their 
keen interest in the COVID Chal-
lenge and commitment to planning 
for a safe residential experience 
made them an ideal constituent 
group to talk with.”
According to Gallimore, the orig-
inal timeline planned for a decision 
about fall semester was to be made 
in July. The timeline was moved up 
one month, allowing for the deci-
sion to come at the end of June.
“What we will do actually is 
in some respects use June and 
July and August to do a number 

of things, to do some practice ses-
sions, dry runs et cetera, so that 
we’re ready for you when many of 
you come back in late August for a 
wonderful semester of mixed edu-
cational experiences,” Gallimore 
said. “We will use the fall term to 
evaluate how things worked and 
improve upon them for winter 
2021.”
Gallimore 
emphasized 
the 
hundreds of administrators, fac-
ulty, staff and students involved 
in planning efforts by pointing to 
the numerous committees work-
ing on issues ranging from testing 
to transportation to student mental 
health. Similar to the new Campus 
Maize & Blueprint website, Galli-
more said success of the school year 
would depend on “stacking” mea-
sures from physical distancing to 
administrative controls on density.
Generally, classes with over 50 
people will be conducted remotely, 
while classes with 10 to 15 or fewer 
students will be held in-person, 
subject to space availability, Gal-
limore explained. Classes in the 
in-between range may be offered 
in-person if physical distancing is 
possible in the learning space.
Jones focused on the need for 
students to be responsible, which 
both she and Gallimore expressed 
was one of their greatest worries 
about the upcoming semester. She 
shared a draft of a behavior pledge 
which 
includes 
current 
public 
health guidelines such as wearing 
masks, maintaining social distance 
and limiting social gatherings. 
To encourage individuals to fol-
low the pledge, Jones said there 
will be education efforts and social 
media campaigns to emphasize 
its importance. Jones said she 
hoped the University community 
would embrace a “culture of care” 
in which everyone acts according 
to the well-being of those around 
them — particularly those most 
vulnerable to the virus — and 
beyond their own desires of what 
they want to do.

After the killing of George Floyd, 
protests against police brutality 
and racism erupted nationwide, 
calling for an end to systemic rac-
ism, police department oversight 
and defunding the police.
With elections coming up on 
August 4, City Council candidates 
from all five of Ann Arbor’s wards 
have turned their focus to fighting 
police brutality in Ann Arbor. In 
interviews with The Daily, candi-
dates detailed policies such as real-
locating the police budget, implicit 
bias training for officers and police 
oversight.
Anne Bannister, Democrat for 
Ward 1 
City Councilmember Anne Ban-
nister, D-Ward 1, is running for re-
election and said she believes all 
citizens of Ann Arbor deserve to be 
treated humanely, justly and with 
dignity. 
According 
to 
her 
platform, 
Bannister supported the creation 
of the Independent Community 
Police Oversight Commission and 
strongly believes in communicat-
ing with victims of systemic racism 
and ensuring their problems are 

addressed.
Bannister said she plans to 
ensure better training of police 
officers to reduce implicit bias 
and also believes the community 
should be able to easily access law 
enforcement data. With the help of 
Police Chief Michael Cox, Bannis-
ter hopes community policing will 
be improved.
“Like our whole country, I’ve 
been very hurt and disappointed 
and disturbed by the incidents of 
police brutality around the coun-
try,” Bannister said. “(We have to) 
further this philosophy of compas-
sion and well-trained officers that 
are here to protect us.”
Lisa Disch, Democrat for Ward 1 
University of Michigan profes-
sor Lisa Disch is running against 
Bannister.
Disch said she believes creating 
a community that upholds safety 
is essential. Her platform includes 
ensuring the safety of people being 
stopped by law enforcement with-
out cause and also expanding com-
munity policing.
Disch said she has heard about 
numerous 
incidents 
of 
racial 
harassment from Ann Arbor resi-
dents. She said she wants to work 
on eradicating the fear residents 
may feel when reporting these inci-
dents. She said she aims to change 
local law to increase the over-
sight power of ICPOC, review and 
reallocate the Ann Arbor Police 
Department budget and reorient 

policing to focus on the causes of 
crime.
“I am struck, but not surprised, 
by hearing people say that they feel 
free to relate their concerns in pub-
lic forums but that they hesitate to 
file official grievances,” Disch said. 
“That fear itself, let alone the treat-
ment they describe, tells me that 
this city has urgent work to do.”
Disch supports the prevention of 
biased crime reporting and wishes 
to implement implicit bias training 
for all police officers.
“This is just a start,” Disch said. 
“I continue to listen and learn, and 
hope to work collaboratively with 
other council members and ICPOC 
to find creative solutions moving 
forward.”
Jane Lumm, Democrat for Ward 
2
Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2, who is 
running for re-election as a Demo-
crat, has represented Ward 2 as an 
Independent since 2011. She is one 
of the two councilmember liaisons 
on the ICPOC and has been work-
ing towards police oversight since 
2018. She believes ICPOC needs to 
have more access to police records 
to ensure effective oversight.
Lumm said she supports Police 
Chief Cox and believes that he 
will lead the AAPD towards better 
policing policies, tactics and train-
ing.

After the Schlissel’s announcement, Dean 
of Engineering explains the decision

In light of recent events, 
contenders add reform 
measures to platforms 


there is a physical difference between 
the white and black races which I believe 
will forever forbid the two races living 
together on terms of social and political 
equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so 
live, while they do remain together there 
must be the position of superior and infe-
rior, and I as much as any other man am 
in favor of having the superior position 
assigned to the white race.” 
Simply put, Lincoln was never anti-
racist. However, one can say that Lincoln 
had morally and politically detested the 
system of slavery throughout his life. His 
opinion was that the method of unfree 
labor was opposed to the basic postulates 
of republican freedom and believed they 
would morally undermine the nation. 
Lincoln saw great promise for the coun-
try and “rejected the popular notion that 
society needed a permanent class of low-
wage workers to provide the foundation 
for economic progress—an idea that in its 
most extreme form was the rationale for 
slavery.” Depicted most prominently in 
his “House Divided” speech from June 
1858, Lincoln believed, “‘A house divided 
against itself cannot stand.’ I believe this 
government cannot endure permanently 
half slave and half free.” America could 
not have sustained itself as a half free and 
half slave nation, and thus the concept 
of “free labor” was reimagined, making 
it opportune for economic progress in 
the North to stop reliance on slavery. He 
finally reached a compromise with the 
radical opponents of slavery at the time, 
and they decided that containment of 
slavery — to let slavery exist where it was 
granted by the Constitution, but prevent 
further expansion — would suffice. 
Rewinding to the start of the 19th 
century, the economy of America was 
predominantly agricultural and scat-
tered throughout rural communities. 
However, as industries and technologies 
began to weave themselves into Ameri-
can society, the rise of railway construc-
tion and factory-based mass production 
led to an economic boom. Americans 
that were once used to working in small, 
local shops or for themselves took up jobs 
in the growing number of factories. This 
industrial promise of upward mobility 
was essential for both the nation’s social 
stability and economic prosperity. How-
ever, it was a different story for many 
antebellum Americans that remained 
advocates for slavery and, therefore, 
resented the economic developments that 
paralleled abolition. Unlike the northern 
states who were boasting industrialized 
factories and modern technological devel-
opments, the South still relied heavily on 
agricultural economics and consequen-
tially, the enslavement of Black people. 
Even after the Emancipation Proclama-
tion declared the abolishment of slavery 
on Jan. 1, 1863, many states waited until 
the 13th Amendment was ratified by Con-
gress, which was passed by a narrow mar-
gin on Jan. 31, 1865. 
Regardless, many Confederate states 
refused to follow the order even after 
rejoining the Union and so the official 
process of liberation did not occur unless 
an enslaved person escaped and reached 

Union zones or until their enslaver had 
been confronted by federal Union troops 
with an executive order to release their 
enslaved people. The last body of enslaved 
people to be reached with the news of 
abolishment was in Galveston, Texas on 
June 19, 1865 — two and a half years after 
the implementation of the Emancipa-
tion Proclamation — marking the official 
liberation of all chattel enslaved Black 
people in America. Noliwe Rooks, direc-
tor of American studies and professor of 
Africana studies at Cornell University, 
stated, “The idea that people in that part 
of Texas had no idea that the war was 
over is farcical, quite frankly. There were 
wire services, there were newspapers 
… The larger plantation owners were 
very wealthy and wealthy people have 
access to information. They were brutal 
people but they were the ruling class in 
the United States. They were elite, many 
were wealthy, they were not illiterate or 
backwards. They were brutal and inhu-
man, but not ignorant.” The prolonged, 
painfully drawn-out end to slavery was 
fueled by selfishness, apathy and greed. 
For this reason, and many others, June 19 
is an important holiday and is recognized 
as the true American Independence day 
among the Black community. It is offi-
cially recognized in 47 states. 
After the Civil War, the Confederate 
flag became a heroic symbol for nostal-
gic racists and was sustained as a white 
supremacist logo to be rekindled amongst 
civil rights progressions in the nation. An 
indoctrinated misconception is that slav-
ery was exclusive to the South, but the 
reality is that slavery was incredibly pres-
ent in the North, especially in New Jersey. 
In fact, the 13th Amendment, which abol-
ished slavery in the Confederate states, 
failed to acknowledge the persistence of 
slavery in northern states such as New 
Jersey which did not officially liberate 
their slaves until 1866. It didn’t stop there. 
More than 100 years after the Eman-
cipation Proclamation, into the 1960s, 
there were still Black families in the 
Deep South who had no idea they were 
categorically free. From being cyclically 
and continuously indebted to plantation 
owners to ancestors signing documents 
they couldn’t read, 20th century slaves 
were not allowed to leave the plantation 
property. There was no way for the fami-
lies to know that how they were living 
was any different from anyone else in the 
country — “the land down [there] goes on 
forever. These plantations are a country 
unto themselves.” Antoinette Harrell, 
who researched and interviewed Black 
families who came forward with their 
experiences, said, “Slavery will continue 
to redefine itself for African Americans 
for years to come. The school to prison 
pipeline and private penitentiaries are 
just a few of the new ways to guaran-
tee that black people provide free labor 
for the system at large. However, I also 
believe there are still African families 
who are tied to Southern farms in the 
most antebellum sense of speaking.

A

fter resolving that Presi-
dent Trump was unfamiliar 
with the significance of both 
June 19 and Tulsa, Sen. Tim Scott, 
R-S.C., — the only Black Republican in 
the Senate — stated, “I’m thankful that 
he moved it … once he was informed on 
what Juneteenth was, that was a good 
decision on his part.” After this inci-
dent, many have moved to recognize 
Juneteenth as a holiday for employ-
ees, including New York Gov. Andrew 
Cuomo and companies including Best 
Buy, Nike and Postmates, among oth-
ers. This has also been the first year 
we’ve witnessed widespread media 
coverage of Juneteenth, which has 
undeniably uncovered the fact that mil-
lions of Americans are unaware of the 
histories of our country. 
The demand is simple: Juneteenth 
needs to be a federal holiday, one that 
recognizes the humanity and deserved 
independence of all American citizens, 
not only those who sought indepen-
dence to then enslave others. We live 
in a nation whose schooling system is 
designed to indoctrinate a false his-
tory of America. The White House 
and the Trump administration — who 
were admittedly ignorant to the day on 
which the last enslaved people were 
officially emancipated, the significance 
of Tulsa and Black Wall Street and the 
Tulsa race massacre, which is known 

to be the worst incident of racial vio-
lence in American history — symbolize 
this complicit American ignorance and 
lack of education. We must do better. 
We must celebrate Black history, not in 
the month of February or when Black 
bodies are hanging, but as a way of life 
and as American history. 
Trump and his campaign aides failed 
to grasp the significance of holding a 
political rally on Juneteenth, nor did they 
realize that Tulsa’s history compounded 
the racial insensitivity of already want-
ing to hold a rally amid a deeply painful 
time for the country. When asked if the 
coincidental scheduling was intentional, 
Trump responded, “Think about it as a 
celebration. My rally is a celebration.” 
However, the president’s rallies never 
seem to celebrate anything other than 
white supremacy and further division 
of the country. In a Politico Playbook 
audio briefing, they said Trump is “torn 
between the impulse to speak and cater 
to his base, and the demands of govern-
ing a multiracial country in the throes of 
unprecedented turmoil and upheaval. 
He seems generally uncertain of his 
place in the moment, and in the broader 
history of our country.” It is not surpris-
ing to many, especially after learning of 
his inability to grasp the fundamental 
history of Pearl Harbor. A former senior 
White House adviser said: “He was at 
times dangerously uninformed.” 

This seems to be a recurring embar-
rassment for the president, but to think 
that all of those who advise Trump are 
not sophisticated enough to under-
stand the significance of holding a rally 
so close to Juneteenth in Tulsa would 
also be a dangerous underestimation. 
This leads many to believe that Stephen 
Miller — a white nationalist, one of the 
president’s closest aides and his “xeno-
phobic homunculus” — understood the 
direct message they were sending with 
the rally: deeper division of the country 
along humanitarian and racial lines. 
We are often taught that Abraham 
Lincoln was the white savior of the 
slavery narrative, that he courageously 
abolished slavery and the inhuman-
ities that had transpired in America’s 
past. This narrative, along with so 
many other examples of whitewashed 
American history, has been undeniably 
contorted when one examines actual 
perspectives of the former president. 
From Lincoln’s Sept. 18, 1858 debate 
with Judge Douglas, he states: “I will say 
then that I am not, nor ever have been, 
in favor of bringing about in any way the 
social and political equality of the black 
and white races -- that I am not nor ever 
have been in favor of making VOTERS 
or jurors of negroes, NOR OF QUALI-
FYING THEM HOLD OFFICE, nor 
to intermarry with white people; 
and I will say in addition to this that

Juneteenth, Black Wall Street and why ignorance is not bliss
A

s we continue into the first days of summer surrounded by nationwide protests 
for intersectional Black liberation, many were understandably appalled when 
President Donald Trump announced he was planning to hold a rally in Tulsa, 
Okla., on June 19. This decision to hold his first rally in three months on Juneteenth, a holiday 
that commemorates the ending of slavery in the U.S., and in Tulsa, where this month marks 
the 99th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, was deemed racially insensitive by many.

I

f someone ever asked me to describe 
my experience with sexual assault at 
the University of Michigan, I would 
tell them being a female student on a college 
campus has become a position of anxiety, 
fear and emotional distress. I would tell 
them that I have seen countless friends’ lives 
altered because of sexual assault. I would 
tell them I have had strangers grab my hips 
and pull me in close at tailgates in broad 
daylight. I would tell them that I have seen 
intoxicated girls slipped drugs at parties, 
and so — even though no one should have 
to — I hold myself accountable to not get 
drunk. I would tell them I have witnessed 
fraternity brothers raise their solo cups in 
confirmation that they found a girl drunk 
enough to have sex with them. I would tell 
them that unless they are currently a female 
student on a college campus, they have no 
idea just how ingrained sexual misconduct 
has become within the college culture. 
In the midst of a global pandemic, 
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has 
reversed any success that has been made 
combating the long-lasting sexual assault 
epidemic. Last month, DeVos fundamen-
tally changed the landscape of Title IX and 
tipped the scales in favor of those accused. 
The guidance documents issued by the 
Obama administration to consider all 
investigations of misconduct are long gone. 
The finalized Title IX regulations narrow 
the definition of sexual harassment, as 
well as require live hearings and protect 
those accused of campus sexual assault by 
allowing them to question evidence and 
cross-examine the plaintiff. Live hear-
ings with cross-examination were already 
required at the University, however, now 
the perpetrator can have their lawyer 
cross-examine the victim with meticulous 
questioning that has been honed through 
years of legal training, making the campus 
disciplinary process more like a daunt-
ing courtroom. Chanel Miller, a survivor 
at Stanford University whose assault had 
multiple witnesses, describes her inter-
rogation by lawyers as being “pummeled 
with narrowed, pointed questions that dis-
sected (her) personal life, love life, past life, 
family life, inane questions, accumulating 
trivial details to try and find an excuse for 
this guy who had (her) half naked before 
even bothering to ask (her) name.” They 
will do everything they can to manipulate 
the victim until they prove the case as a 
misunderstanding, even when the sexual 
assault is blatantly evident. 
 Economic inequalities will be ampli-
fied since some students will not be able 
to afford lawyers. This will unlevel the 
playing field during cross-examination 
because now there could be an expert 
examining one student and someone who 
has no experience with the law examining 
the other. 
Additionally, under the new regulations, 
universities can adopt a “clear and convinc-

ing evidence standard,” making sexual 
assault cases even harder to prove because 
now evidence must be deemed substantially 
more probable to be true than not true. This 
is more rigorous than the current “prepon-
derance of the evidence standard,” which 
requires enough evidence for the judge or 
jury to rule that the plaintiff’s claims have 
a greater than 50 percent chance of being 
true. The only higher burden of proof would 
be “beyond reasonable doubt.” It is alarm-
ing that such a strict burden of proof can be 
adopted for an offense that commonly hap-
pens in private and is already hard to obtain 
concrete physical evidence of.
Under the new definition of sexual 
assault and harassment, federally funded 
schools are required to only investigate 
the most extreme forms of harassment. 
Sexual harassment must be determined 
by a “reasonable person” to be “so severe, 
pervasive and objectively offensive that it 
effectively denies a person equal access to 
the school’s education program or activ-
ity.” This definition presented by DeVos 
is widely subjective and makes it harder 
for sexual harassment cases to even go 
to a hearing. Victims must have repeated 
and escalated levels of sexual harassment 
before they can file a claim. Addition-
ally, the definition is much narrower than 
the current federal definition of sexual 
harassment: “unwelcome sexual advanc-
es, requests for sexual favors, and other 
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual 
nature constitutes sexual harassment 
when submission to or rejection of this 
conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an 
individual’s employment, unreasonably 
interferes with an individual’s work per-
formance or creates an intimidating, hos-
tile or offensive work environment.” 
A key issue that has not been addressed 
is if someone was intoxicated during the 
incident, their case may not be seriously 
considered. This is unnerving consider-
ing alcohol is involved in approximately 50 
percent of college sexual assaults and 90 
percent of sexual assaults perpetrated by an 
acquaintance of the victim. Alcohol has long 
been a factor that complicates sexual assault 
cases because often the victim does not 
remember parts of the assault or the assault 
as a whole. Unconsciousness has almost 
become a loophole for the accused to get 
out of college rape investigations with zero 
violations. For example, in a recent sexual 
assault case regarding students on the Uni-
versity track team, a Washtenaw County 
assistant prosecutor said the case could not 
be prosecuted, even though the perpetrator 
admitted to the assault over text, because 
the female victim was asleep and could not 
remember the event.

DeVos’s anti-survivor ideology

“

Injustice anywhere is a threat 
to 
justice 
everywhere.” 
- Martin Luther King Jr. 
We made it. Our parents immi-
grated from Afghanistan, India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, 
Nepal and countless other Asian 
countries to attain a more oppor-
tune life in America. They pushed 
us to be the very best. They sacri-
ficed for us. We worked hard, we 
got into the country’s top universi-
ties and we achieved the so-called 
American dream. And in the midst 
of all that, we’ve dangerously given 
into what is known as the model 
minority myth. As Vijay Prashad 
asks in his timely novel “The Karma 
of Brown Folk,” “How does it feel 
to be a solution?” How does it feel 
to be complicit in our success that 
serves as a vindication for this coun-
try’s history of discrimination and 
oppression? How does it feel to turn 
a blind eye to systemic injustices 
taking place not only in the United 
States, but also to those back home? 
Because as Hasan Minhaj reveals 
in his Patriot Act digital exclusive, 
while the blood of Black lives may not 
be directly on our hands, we are quite 
literally at the scene of the crime. 
The unjust death of George Floyd 
felt like the great awakening people 
needed to catalyze racial reckonings 
across the globe. Our Black commu-
nity has felt this heavy rage for far 
too long, and we’ve been indifferent 
to their pain. Instead, we seek valida-
tion from white institutions, and we 
look down on Black people with racial 
resentment: the unfounded feeling 
that “blacks violate such traditional 
American values as individualism 
and self reliance.” We praise Black 
excellence, but we criticize Black fail-
ure as laziness, refusing to question 
the glaring systemic issues at hand. 
After all, how could a system that 
we found success in be oppressive? 
Writer Frank Chin put it perfectly in 
1974: “Whites love (Asian Americans) 
because we’re not black.” While our 
hard work is valid, it is not the sole 
reason for our success. Our success is 
rooted in our political silence and eth-
nic assimilation, and it exists because 
we are afforded better opportunities 
than our Black counterparts. 
In accordance with the model 
minority myth, it’s easy to believe 
we’ve been “bestowed with the 
‘right’ work ethic and family bonds 
required to succeed in America.” We 
have not been historically kidnapped 
from our country and stripped of our 
heritage to then be forced into slave 
labor to build a nation on stolen land 
— it’s easy to believe when we ignore 

the mass incarceration of Black peo-
ple that separate families daily. We 
crudely justify our own anti-Black 
sentiments because “we’re minori-
ties too.” But this narrative is not a 
scapegoat for our silence because 
while we’ve faced various forms of 
harsh discrimination in the United 
States, we have never endured the 
level of extreme systematic dehu-
manization that African Americans 
have experienced. 
Standing in solidarity with the 
Black community does not invalidate 
South Asian struggles, and speak-
ing to allyship as such demonstrates 
heartbreaking apathy and insensitiv-
ity. Black people should not have to 
die for us to do the bare minimum 
and demand a more equitable ladder 
of success for all people of color. Our 
rage for the heinous acts of police vio-
lence should go beyond, if not match, 
that of when we are racially profiled 
at airport security or when we are 
told to “go back to our own country.” 
And the truth of the matter is police 
brutality and systemic discrimina-
tion aren’t new in South Asian coun-
tries, namely India. Partly as a result 
of British colonization, we’ve become 
complicit to the cultural norms of 
colorism, casteism, Islamophobia 
and Hindutva, a modern right-wing 
political ideology also known as 
Hindu nationalism. Our harmful 
compliance towards extreme eco-
nomic inequality and the growing 
persecution of Dalits (lower caste 
members), 
Adivasis 
(indigenous 
tribes people) and Muslims in India 
have only further ingrained these 
attitudes within many Desis, and 
they contribute to anti-Black senti-
ments brought with us to the States. 
Like many non-Black people 
of color, our standards of beauty, 
worth and status in society have 
been defined by our skin’s level of 
melanin. We’ve been raised to ideal-
ize Eurocentric beauty and to take 
every precaution to obtain the fair-
est skin possible. While the goal of 
South Asian solidarity is not to shift 
the narrative to colorism, we must 
recognize that our anti-Black preju-
dice derives from colorist and cas-
teist attitudes and thus contributes to 
daily racial microaggressions. While 
we are shamed for any excessive 
color, our Black brothers and sis-
ters are systemically and indi-
vidually dehumanized for it; they 
are killed for it based on extreme 
internalized racism that resides 
in the structure of our police 
force. And our disdain towards 
darker skin only advances racial 
intolerance within our communi-

ty. That, in addition to our passive 
submission of this country’s white 
supremacist ideals and our genera-
tion’s notorious appropriation of Black 
culture, makes our silence speak vol-
umes — especially when we owe the 
creation of South Asian America to 
African-American activists. 
The Immigration and Nationality 
Act of 1965 forced massive immigra-
tion reforms that got rid of national-
origins quota systems, xenophobic 
policies and outright bans for Arab, 
Indian and Muslim immigration. 
Pressure from the Civil Rights 
Movement and Black solidarity 
with Asian Americans pushed for 
non-discriminatory visa policies 
that paved the way for our current 
residing status. South Asian and 
African-American solidarity, how-
ever, existed far before this act was 
passed, and it goes beyond Martin 
Luther King Jr.’s use of Gandhian 
nonviolence. The parallels between 
the Civil Rights Movement and 
South Asian liberation movements 
like Quit India instilled a historical 
alliance between these two com-
munities that we continuously fail 
to recognize today as South Asian 
presence in the States is vastly over-
looked prior to 1965. 
Activists such as Swami Vive-
kananda and Bayard Rustin stood 
as allies for each others’ communi-
ty during their respective fight for 
human rights and independence. 
During the Jim Crow era, Bengali 
Muslim migrants were taken in by 
working-class African-American 
and Puerto Rican neighborhoods 
— giving way to Bengali Harlem 
— while Indian freedom fighters 
like Ram Manohar Lohia taught 
activism techniques at historically 
Black schools and encouraged 
nonviolent civil disobedience. In 
the 2014 events of Ferguson, Miss., 
South Asian Americans organized 
and spoke out against anti-Black 
racism, but our alliance cannot 
end there. We need more leaders 
like Rahul Dubey, who sheltered 
Black Lives Matter protesters in 
Washington, D.C., from arrest, 
and the Bangladeshi family res-
taurant in Minneapolis that 
acted as a staging area for med-
ics and resting place for protest-
ers. In a fight against injustice 
that we are all too familiar with, 
South Asian acts of solidarity for 
Black lives are crucial.

ALBUM REVIEW
ALBUM REVIEW

Bob Dylan reckons 
with the apocalypse

On Dec. 13, 1963, Bob Dylan was given the 
“Tom Paine Award” by the Emergency Civil 
Liberties Committee for his political activism. 
A visibly shaken, and likely drunk, Dylan said he 
accepted the award on behalf of “everybody that 
went down to Cuba,” then unleashed a doozy: 
“I got to admit that the man who shot President 
Kennedy, Lee Oswald … I saw some of myself in 
him.” The crowd booed him off the stage. 
A few days later, Dylan released a statement 
that read, in part, “If there’s violence in the 
times, then there must be violence in me.” 
It’s 2020, and the times are more violent than 
ever. They have been for a while. Where has 
Bob Dylan been in the era of Donald Trump, 
mass shootings, climate crisis and COVID-19? 
Where’s the singer who marched on Washing-
ton with Martin Luther King Jr. and wrote sear-
ing political anthems like “The Times They Are 
a-Changin’,” “The Lonesome Death of Hattie 
Carroll” and “Only a Pawn in Their Game?” He 
was releasing Sinatra cover albums — three, to 
be exact — from 2015-2017. It seemed, for those 
who hoped for a guiding message from rock’s 
poet laureate, that Dylan had decided to sit this 
one out. 
Yet, in June 2020, Bob Dylan is back with his 
first album of original music in almost a decade 
— Rough and Rowdy Ways. It’s a career-defin-
ing masterpiece, an album both bracingly cur-
rent yet timeless in its compositional breadth, 
pulling from the best of Dylan’s work through 
the decades. Rough and Rowdy Ways has the 
enthralling auditory grit of 1997’s Grammy-
winning Time Out of Mind, the socio-political 
layers of Highway 61 Revisited and the personal 
revelations of Blood on the Tracks. 
“Today and tomorrow, and yesterday too,” 
Dylan begins the album’s first song, “I Contain 
Multitudes.” “The flowers are dyin’, like all 

things do.” Dylan’s message is clear from the 
start: These are the end times. Yet after this 
apocalyptic pronouncement, he implores an 
unnamed woman to “Follow me close … I’ll lose 
my mind if you don’t come with me.” In Dylan’s 
world, where “Everything’s flowing, all at the 
same time,” one can “sleep with life and death in 
the same bed.” Basically, even if everyone’s going 
to die, they don’t have to die alone.
In a whimsical, almost snide cadence, Dylan 
throws in a myriad of other personal complexi-
ties, but one line stands out: “I’m just like Anne 
Frank, like Indiana Jones and them British bad 
boys the Rolling Stones.” The lyric bristles at the 
ear, mainly because it’s so impenetrable. How 
is the 79-year-old Dylan, while a rock star like 
the Rolling Stones, like Anne Frank or Indiana 
Jones? 
Right from the start, Rough and Rowdy Ways 
is sonically striking. Dylan’s last original album, 
2012’s Tempest, was chock-full of crashing 
drums, out-of-control guitars and a voice that 
sounded like Dylan had swallowed a gallon of 
rocks. Dylan has self-produced every one of his 
albums since 1997, and generally favors a raw, 
unfiltered performance by both himself and his 
tour band. This time, though, he’s meticulously 
crafted every aspect of the album. The instru-
mentation and his voice transform to reflect the 
subject matter of each song. “I Contain Multi-
tudes” is almost completely acoustic, intimately 
shading the confessional lyrics as the listener is 
drawn in by Dylan’s soft voice. 
This comfort is ripped away on the second 
track, “False Prophet.” Amid crashing drums and 
smarmy guitar, Dylan continues the dark lamen-
tations in a Tempest-style bark — “I know how 
it happened, I saw it begin. I opened my heart 
to the world, and the world caved in.” While he 
doesn’t yet reveal what caused this apocalypse, 
Dylan asserts with haggard surety “I’m no false 
prophet, I just know what I know.”
Things get weirder in “My Own Version of 

ANDREW WARRICK

You,” a song backed by a mournful steel gui-
tar straight out of a retro horror flick. Dylan 
details his plan to dig up “limbs and livers and 
brains and hearts” and “bring someone to life … 
someone who feels the way that I feel.” Again, 
love and death are bedmates. While Dylan, par-
roting Victor Frankenstein, swears to act with 
“decency and common sense … for the benefit 
of all mankind” with his creation, he also asks 
“What would Julius Caesar do?” Like Cae-
sar, and all authoritarians, Dylan considers his 
actions, however inhumane, permissible since 
he believes himself to be working for the com-
mon good. Adding to this prescient commentary, 
Dylan invites the listener to “Step right into the 
burning hell, where some of the best-known 
enemies of mankind dwell.” 
In these flames, Dylan somehow finds a way 
to sing a masterful love song, “I’ve Made Up My 
Mind to Give Myself to You.” 
“I’m sitting on my terrace, lost in the stars,” he 
begins. The Sinatra phase has paid off — Dylan’s 
voice hasn’t sounded this sharp in decades, a 
cavernous croon that soars with genuine affec-
tion. The soft instrumentation builds to a sub-
lime electric guitar solo that’s one of the best 
moments on the album. There are also faint, 
almost imperceptible backing singers, one of 
which just might be Fiona Apple, whose soft 
choral drone gives the song a sense of deep mel-
ancholy. When Dylan sings, almost tearfully, “I 
don’t think I could bear to live my life alone,” it’s 
as moving as anything from his love-sick opus 
Blood on The Tracks. Thankfully Dylan meets 
someone, telling this unnamed lover “I’ll lay 
down beside you when everyone’s gone.” In a 
time when reality itself seems to be falling apart, 
Dylan’s honesty is piercing. 
Then comes “Black Rider.” To the tune of a 
slithering acoustic guitar, Dylan criticizes an 
unnamed man for womanizing, violence and 
arrogance (all of which Dylan has displayed 
thus far in the album, making one wonder if the 
song is a soliloquy, critiquing Dylan’s own dark, 
masculine shades). Whoever the black rider is, 
Dylan tells the guy “You’ve been on the job too 
long,” before giving one the album’s most brutal, 
and unexpected, lines: “The size of your cock 
will get you nowhere.” Dylan’s lambasting of 
this predatory, arrogant mystery-man brings the 
album’s apocalypse a step closer to 2020.
“Goodbye Jimmy Reed” adds another politi-
cal layer, with Dylan deciding “That old time 
religion is just what I need” and promising to 
“thump on the Bible, proclaim the creed.” Right 
after this declaration, however, Dylan tells a 
woman he will “break open your grapes, suck 
out the juice,” while admitting “I need you like 
my head needs a noose.” The fusion of funda-
mentalist religion with hypocritical lust and 
punishing violence adds another shade of rel-
evance. After all, the tear-gassing, psychopathic 
president who swore to “grab them by the” you-
know-what got 81 percent of the evangelical 
vote. 
Subject matter aside, “
Jimmy Reed” is a sonic 
escape to a time gone by, with rollicking guitar 
and harmonica straight out of Dylan’s 1966 clas-
sic Blonde on Blonde. Again, Dylan shows his 
multitudes and proves that, even in the end of 
days, one can still have a little fun.
In “Mother of Muses,” Dylan is back to grap-

pling with apocalypse. Like Dante, he implores 
the muses to “show me your wisdom” and guide 
him through the hell-fire. Then Dylan gives a list 
of muses much like the idiosyncratic roster in “I 
Contain Multitudes,” naming William Sherman, 
Bernard Montgomery, Winfield Scott, Georgy 
Zhukov, George Patton, Elvis Presley and Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Again, one is befuddled. 
What do Union and World War II Allied gener-
als, a rock star and Martin Luther King Jr. have 
to do with one another?
Regardless, Dylan seems comforted by these 
muses in the next track, “Crossing the Rubicon.” 
He regards the “red river” that lays before him, 
“one step from the great beyond.” With a rolling 
guitar-lick, Dylan declares “I embrace my love, 
put down my head and I cross the Rubicon.” He 
has leapt over the river of blood and has passed 
into the afterworld. 
Dylan explores the afterlife in the master-
piece “Key West (Philosopher Pirate).” It’s the 
most musically complex song of the album, a 
masterful blend of guitar, ghostly background 
singing and accordion riffs that lap at Dylan’s 
lyrics like waves on a midnight beach. 
Key West, according to Dylan, is “the place 
to be if you’re looking for immortality,” a neth-
erworld that radiates from a “pirate radio sta-
tion.” Bob Dylan, the only songwriter thus far to 
win the Nobel Prize, spending his afterlife in the 
sound waves is more than fitting.
“I was born on the wrong side of the railroad 
track,” he says, referencing his childhood in the 
barren mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota. 
“Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac.” While at 
79, Dylan still appears healthy, it isn’t hard 
to interpret the song as a meditation on both 
death and an eternity as a literary icon. He’ll be 
remembered as one of the best, but what will 
happen to his soul?
Key West is “innocence and purity … para-
dise divine” yet also unrelentingly hot and “at 
the bottom,” full of “blossoms of a toxic plant.” 
Even in the afterlife there are multitudes; love 
and horror are intimately intertwined. Is this 
Heaven, Hell or somewhere in between?
Either way, for this grizzled pirate in the 
throes of eternity, the heart still wants what it 
wants. “I’m so deep in love I can hardly see,” 
he proclaims. Yet his muse is gone: “I heard the 
news, I heard your last request. Fly around, my 
pretty little miss.” At Dylan’s age, it’s likely he’s 
seen many lovers come and go, and the accor-
dion’s soft swell makes his sorrow all the more 
potent. This close to the end, even love can’t ease 
the pain. 
While Dylan has grappled with death 
throughout the album, this song is crushing 
because it is no mythological, apocalyptic mus-
ing. It’s tied to Dylan’s own life and career. 
The song ends with Dylan giving the haunting 
admission that for him too, Key West is “on the 
horizon line.” 
Through the past nine songs, Dylan has 
detailed intimate secrets, unpacked toxic mas-
culinity, religious hypocrisy, impending mass 
death and his own legacy. Yet he isn’t done. 
There’s a final, devastating epic to, paraphrasing 
one of Dylan’s classics, bring it all back home.

The New York City Ballet cancelled its 
famous five-week run of “The Nutcrack-
er” Thursday, citing advice from govern-
ment officials and medical professionals 
regarding dangers of the coronavirus. The 
nixed Christmas spectacle means the 
company won’t return to the stage until 
2021. The news comes with a certain sense 
of domino-tipping: Who will be next? The 
Joffrey Ballet in Chicago already can-
celled their version of the show, and San 
Francisco Ballet is waiting for news from 
the city’s government to add sugarplums 
to their calendar. As the pandemic builds 
into a second wave cascading across the 
United States, the future of in-person per-
formance jumps further and further into 
an increasingly unstable future. 
Cancelled shows are nothing new in 
2020. At this point, NYCB has cancelled 
its Spring, Summer and Fall seasons, along 
with two galas — but losing the “The Nut-
cracker” is a much deeper wound, and it’s 
one that will be much harder to heal. 
The popularity of the beloved Christ-
mas show is underscored by its commer-
cialized success outside of the theatre: 
The Tchaikovsky score makes its way into 
December car commercials, the Sugar 
Plum puns are well-exploited by Ameri-
can marketing and the Nutcracker doll 
sometimes feels as well known as Santa 
Claus himself. Put simply, the annual mass 
production of Snowflakes and Rat Kings 
makes “Nutcracker” the singular poster 
child for all of ballet. 
Behind the curtain, though, the Land 
of Sweets is also one of opportunity. 
Increased numbers of performances mean 

longer cast lists — students earn spots in 
the huge ensemble and young profession-
als gain breakout roles that they’d usually 
never be in line for. The annual nature 
of “Nutcracker” also makes progressive 
reform more financially feasible: Recent 
years have spurred positive conversations 
about the restaging of previously prob-
lematic representations in the Chinese tea 
and Arabian coffee divertissements. Older 
(and sometimes still current) versions of 
the two sections tend to include embar-
rassingly derogatory depictions of East-
ern cultures, but recent years have seen an 
uptick in reform: Phil Chan and Georgina 
Pazcoguin launched their “Final Bow for 
Yellowface” campaign after successfully 
petitioning NYCB to change their Chi-
nese divertissement in 2017. Other com-
panies have restaged the setting of the 
whole show to reflect the communities 
they serve. Joffrey Ballet’s version takes 
place at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. 
Last year, NYCB also cast its first Black 
“Marie,” the preteen main character of 
the whole show. Albeit quite overdue, 
“Nutcracker’ has operated as the catalyst 
of many larger initiatives for the potential 
of progressive reform in classical ballet. 
The diversity of the ballet’s audience 
also changes come December. Grandpar-
ents sit next to grandchildren and gaggles 
of girlfriends make yearly pilgrimages to 
the opera houses. Swarms of schoolchil-
dren attend matinee field trips and many 
companies also take their dancers to nurs-
ing homes and hospitals. “The Nutcrack-
er” is very often the first piece of dance 
anyone will see, and it’s often cited as the 
reason a dancer begins taking lessons.

Community chamber orchestras are at the 
heart of towns and cities across America. Vol-
unteer, amateur musicians often comprise 
these ensembles, yet some ensembles employ 
high-level, local freelance professionals and 
students at nearby universities. The Ann Arbor 
Camerata (AAC), founded in 2006, is of the 
latter variety. Until 2019, the AAC existed as a 
traditional community chamber orchestra that 
regularly performed in local churches. Now, 
they do things a bit differently, and they’re mak-
ing profound connections with the greater Ann 
Arbor community in the midst of COVID-19.
Thomas Militello, University of Michigan 
Music, Theatre & Dance alum and Ann Arbor 
resident, is the current artistic director of the 
AAC. In a phone interview with the Daily, he 
spoke about the notable changes in the AAC’s 
mission since taking over as artistic director, 
and how the organization is not only staying 
relevant, but also staying true to its mission of 
serving the Ann Arbor community at large, 
especially its most vulnerable members, dur-
ing this challenging time. Militello graduated 
in 2019 with a master’s degree in horn perfor-
mance after completing his undergraduate 
studies at the University of Southern California 
in 2017. While he was primarily in school to 
study horn, he also sought out opportunities in 
conducting, despite not being in the official con-
ducting studio in the Music, Theatre & Dance 
School. Through his involvement in Prof. Ken-
neth Kiesler’s conducting seminar and a con-
ducting cognate with Prof. Michael Haithcock, 
he grew close with graduate students pursuing 
conducting degrees. Before Militello took over, 
that cohort of students ran the AAC.
“The role of artistic director and conductor 
of the Camerata has been passed down through 
the orchestral conducting students at Michi-
gan. I wasn’t next in line, so I got kind of lucky. 
When my class was graduating, they passed it 
to me because they figured I needed a vessel for 
experience if I wanted to pursue conducting at 
the level I was aiming for,” Militello said.
As artistic director, Militello wears many 
hats. Day to day, his responsibilities include 
being in touch with venues, curating perfor-
mances, contracting players, conducting the 
larger ensembles, managing the ensemble’s 
online presence and reaching out to current and 
potential donors. His most significant responsi-
bility, however, has been completely rebrand-
ing the organization’s mission with significant 
changes to its core values.
While the AAC was already a beloved com-
munity orchestra before Militello became its 
artistic director, he felt that there was more that 
could be done to provide accessible engagement 
with classical music to the entire Ann Arbor 

community, not just to those who frequent clas-
sical music concerts. With that direction, the 
ensemble has taken an intentionally accessible 
approach to bring classical music to unconven-
tional spaces and underserved communities. 
One of the biggest organizational changes 
to the AAC was the pivot to a project-based 
“cohort of musicians,” as Militello called the 
ensemble, from the traditional, season-based 
schedule that most orchestras follow. Instead 
of having a set, programmatic agenda for the 
entire year consisting solely of orchestral reper-
toire, the AAC now sets up concerts with both 
orchestra and smaller chamber ensembles that 
are planned in succession.
“With the Camerata being not just function-
al as a chamber orchestra, we gained so much 
flexibility in performance locations, reper-
toire and audiences, as a result,” Militello said. 
“Chamber music has become a performance 
medium that’s essential to who we are.”
The AAC had a remarkably innovative con-
cert series centered around bringing diverse 
chamber music repertoire to unconventional 
audiences and venues when COVID-19 hit 
Michigan. The series, called Main Street Bar 
Crawl, was the first major performance project 
the AAC had planned since the radical change 
in artistic direction. The concerts were cen-
tered around bringing thematically relevant 
standard and nontraditional chamber music 
to popular bars along the Main Street stretch, 
like a brass quintet playing Irish music at Conor 
O’Neill’s and jazz-inspired repertoire at the 
Raven’s Club. The series highlights the ensem-
ble’s motto of “come as you are” — no expecta-
tions, unspoken rules or frills; audiences can 
attend live classical music concerts from the 
comfort of their favorite hangouts and watering 
holes. Main Street Bar Crawl was unfortunate-
ly cancelled for social distancing measures, but 
Militello’s creative, innovative planning did not 
end with its cancellation.
“When all the shutdowns started happen-
ing, it was disappointing for everyone, both 
for audiences and musicians in the Camerata. 
When thinking about how to move forward 
with the ensemble and stay relevant, I was try-
ing to think about who really needed music 
right now, and what communities were most 
vulnerable during this time of need,” Militello 
said.
The first people who came to mind were res-
idents in senior living homes who were not only 
most susceptible to contracting the virus and 
enduring significant trauma with their health, 
but also unable to have in-person contact with 
their families and closest friends. With those 
residents in mind, Militello put a new concert

South Asians need to be 
heldaccountablefortheir 
Anti-Blackness

NITHA ARUN & SUBARNA BHATTACHA-

MiC Guest Writers

The cold didn’t stop anyone from going 
out during syllabus week. We went to an 
event hosted by Sigma Beta Rho, a multi-
cultural fraternity mainly made up of South 
Asian males. The DJ was playing a song and 
the n-word dropped. Without hesitation, 
the crowd of South Asian men sang along. 
To every single word. I stood in shock, yell-
ing to my friend over the music, “Did you 
hear that?” I was one of the only people that 
reacted.
People moved on after the event — if they 
even noticed it to be one — and their silence 
spoke to their complicitness in this blatant 
racism. When the situation was brought 
to the organization’s board, they tried to 
brush it aside. They continued to listen to 
Black artists’ music and claimed their con-
venient proximity to Blackness was enough 
to warrant them a “pass” to say and sing 
the n-word. These same people have said 
nothing substantial since the murders of 
Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George 
Floyd and countless others in the Black 
community. This is not a singular problem; 
rather, this indifferent attitude towards say-
ing the n-word is a symptom of the pervasive, 
ingrained anti-Blackness in the South Asian 
community. 
It’s important to introspect upon our lives 
as South Asians and the experiences that 
come with growing up in America. Many of 
us have heard about or been directly affected 
by the atrocities committed against people 
of our community in America: the “Dot-
busters” after 9/11 who singled out any per-
son who had brown skin and murdered them 
as Islamophobia heightened, or the murder 
of two Indian immigrants in Kansas. Some 
of us have faced more normalized types of 
racism: the IT jokes the Chad or Brad — or 
whatever his name is — made in AP Econ 
or the microaggressions you faced as you 
walked down the street. We’re all aware of 
the stereotypes in the media like Apu and 
Raj which deem our identity as humorous, 
reduced to a side character for comic relief. 
South Asians have been historical targets of 
racism, but we must remember our experi-
ence in no way matches the breadth of insti-
tutional racism which the Black community 
has to confront on a daily basis. We need to 
contextualize ourselves within the history 
of the United States. There are mountains 
upon mountains of problems which remain 
unsolved, but they cannot be resolved if we 
alienate ourselves from the Black commu-
nity, which is what brought us this far in the 
first place. We can never achieve true equal-
ity as non-Black people of color in America 
if we stoop so low as to demean, berate and 
disrespect those who came before us.

“Avatar: The Last Airbender” was an 
animated children’s show released on Nick-
elodeon during the 2000s. The story sur-
rounds the culmination of a 100-year long 
warbetween the hegemonic Fire Nation and 
all other nations and tribes of the world. It 
is based on several people who have the abil-
ity to control one of the four elements around 
them — air, water, earth and fire — while one 
person, the Avatar, can control all four and 
is tasked with keeping the world in balance. 
ATLA is a great symbol of cultural unity. 
It fuses several influences: the stories of Hin-
duism; the cultures of the Arctic, Inuit and 
other indigenous groups; Chinese culture 
with slight influences of Japanese culture 
and many more. The concept of the Avatar 
itself is derived from Hinduism. In Hindu 
scriptures, the god Vishnu has inherited 
an avatar, or an earthly form, the ten times 
he has thought the world needs it most. He 
takes on a brand new life and assimilates into 
normal society, living as a voice of reason and 
good. This is what the main character of this 
show is based on — the concept of the avatar 
who works to keep balance in the world and 
ensure peace is kept. In ATLA, the avatar is 
the reincarnated spirit of Rava, the spirit of 
good, and is meant to master the elements of 
the world and maintain balance.
The different tribes are based on differ-
ent beautiful cultures around the world. The 
two water tribes are respectfully based on 
the Inuit and Yupik people. Their weapons, 
style of clothing and manner of gathering 
food all match up with these cultures. In 
every tribe or nation, there are influences of 
Chinese culture. In the water tribes, it comes 
in the forms of the betrothal necklaces. In 
the Earth Kingdom, the most blatant show of 
relation to the Chinese is the Great Walls of 
Ba Sing Se, similar to the Great Wall of China 
which was built to consolidate the Chinese 

states and protect them from invaders. Their 
clothing — especially their military cloth-
ing and of their leaders — are all based on 
ancient Chinese garb. The Fire Nation’s 
culture is derived from several different 
sources, including the Aztecs and Incas. This 
influence can be seen in the Sun Warriors, 
who teach those around them to harness the 
power of the sun and appreciate its cycles, 
using their sunstone. Another strong influ-
ence in the Fire Nation is of the Chinese and 
Japanese, as with the other groups. The top 
knots worn by Fire National royalty — such 
as Fire Lord Ozai, Prince Zuko and General 
Iroh — represent their positions of power. 
Finally, the Air Nomads are based on Tibet-
an philosophies. In line with their universal 
philosophies, the Air Nomads spend their 
lives meditating and searching for enlighten-
ment. They search to be detached from the 
world and free their spirit.
Each character in this show brings some-
thing unique to the table — whether it’s 
their personal experiences or family history. 
However, the most important part about 
them is the things they have learned from 
their different cultures and the history of 
their people. Katara and Sokka learn about 
the strength of the Water Tribe from their 
grandmother and Katara’s teacher and draw 
inspiration from them. Katara also learns 
about the nuances of the moon spirit, a long 
standing symbol and guardian of her people, 
and learns to draw strength from her. Aang 
learns about the universal philosophies of 
his people from his teacher, Monk Gyatso. 
He learns from their teachings to be impar-
tial, kind and compassionate. Toph uses 
the knowledge of her culture to be strong 
and unrelenting. She takes the strength of 
her predecessors and teachers, and learns 
to turn potential weaknesses into unique 
assets. Despite how different their cultural 
and ethnic backgrounds are...

The Civil Rights Movement paved the way 
for South Asian immigration into the United 
States. Due to the pressure from the move-
ment, Congress passed the Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 1965, also known as the 
Hart-Celler Act. This bill allowed the immi-
gration of wealthy/potentially wealthy South 
Asians into the United States. The latent con-
sequence of this was the myth of the model 
minority. White leaders saw our general eco-
nomic prosperity in the U.S. and used it to 
dismiss the systemic racism that affected the 
Black community. We were tools used to por-
tray the way all minority populations should 
aspire to be; anything less was dismissed as 
laziness and ineptitude. 
We must stop thinking our academic and 
economic success puts us above the Black 
community. This only perpetuates the model 
minority myth, created by white America to 
divide us in the first place. If we continue 
to take advantage of this privilege we have 
been allotted through our “model minority” 
status while denying that it exists at all, we 
will always be complicit in the crimes perpe-
trated against the Black community. 
This complicitness is present in our con-
versations and seemingly harmless “pref-
erences.” I’m reminded of the time when 
my family was house hunting for a home in 
Michigan. Even before stepping inside the 
two-story brick house with a vast lake in the 
backyard —every Indian family’s American 
dream — my parents decided we wouldn’t 
live there because a Black man walked out 
the front door of the neighboring home. We 
need to recognize this generational rac-
ism and ingrained hatred for those who are 
different from us has to end here. We need 
to move past generations of colorist ideals 
because it has impacts not only on our rela-
tionships with other communities, but also 
our own mental health. No one is born racist. 
Anti-Blackness is learned through the envi-
ronment we are exposed to growing up. It is 
our duty to unlearn it. 
We need to hold our peers and family 
accountable without hesitation. We all know 
the scene. You’ll be at aunty’s house for a hol-
iday party and just as you are about to stuff 
that samosa in your mouth, an uncle will 
comment on “how lazy Black people are,” — 
this being the same uncle who made his wife 
bring the food to him. Now, you have two 
options: Pretend you didn’t hear anything 
and eat your samosa chup chap or confront 
him. Your parents give you the “don’t say 
anything” look. It is at this point that you 
drop the obedient achha bachcha guise and 
indoctrinate uncle on the systemic racism 
that has resulted in several inequities in the 
Black community.

Colonial indoctrination and colorism
in India

SUNITHA PALAT
MiC Staff Writer

As the Black liberation move-
ment gained traction over the past 
month, I, like many others, have 
taken time to learn, understand 
and reflect on the systemic racial 
prejudice ingrained in this country 
against Black Americans. However, 
from a broader perspective, I’ve 
also taken the time to look intro-
spectively and reflect on the silent, 
learned biases I’ve experienced 
throughout my life and how to 
actively combat them — especially 
within the Indian community. In 
India, there exists a conglomeration 
of different skin tones, shades of 
brown, languages and cultures, but 
like most diverse nations, prejudice 
and innate biases continue to per-
petuate. Most recognizable to me 
is colorism on the spectrum of skin 
tone.There is an old Indian home-
remedy recommended for expect-
ing mothers — mainly those with 
a darker, “musty” tone — to drink 
saffron milk once a day to make 
sure their child will be “blessed” 
with fair skin. Many Indian fami-

A customary “chill”: the dangers 
of being politically correct
In today’s racial climate, terms 
such as “micro-aggressions” and 
“gaslighting” have become main-
stream terminology when address-
ing racism at the micro-level. Many 
are content as they find their lived 
experiences being summed up by 
these newly-coined terms. Others 
are stunned, learning for the first 
time phrases they once thought 
were nonchalant actually attrib-
uted to a toxic culture of ignorance 
and apathy. 
These terms are now being rede-
fined and in doing so, are creating 
awareness worldwide. Facts and 
statistics are more readily avail-
able than ever with infographics 
about systemic racism flooding 
social media platforms. However, 
I wonder what change will truly 
come about if American society

does not expand their emotional 
bandwidth to feel and share the 
feelings required to push forward 
for change.
Within social circles, it has 
become increasingly familiar to 
avoid the uncomfortable. It’s not 
that people don’t know what’s hap-
pening. Individuals instead instinc-

lies, secretly or not, hope their 
child is born with a lighter com-
plexion due to the increased lik-
ability and desirability they would 
possess in society, but the quest for 
fairness does not end here. Skin-
lightening products, like “Fair & 
Lovely,” “Pond’s White Beauty” 
and “Lotus Herbals Whiteglow” 
are commonplace in Indian gro-
cery stores, and make up an indus-
try expected to be worth over $24 
billion by 2027 globally. The media 
portrays lighter-skinned families 
in advertisements and TV shows, 
and Bollywood favors lighter-
skinned actresses like Aishwarya 
Rai, Kareena Kapoor and Katrina 
Kaif (who is also half-white) as the 
stars of films, creating an inaccu-
rate ideal for Indians to look up to. 
This representation issue has been 
addressed more recently by certain 
actors and actresses’ campaigns, 
like Nandita Das’ “Stay Unfair, Stay 
Beautiful” campaign, but many stay 
complacent. Yet, colorism might be 
most noticeable at the grassroots 
level. Comments from Indian rela-
tives or acquaintances like “The 
bride is pretty, but dark,” “Oh, she’s 
so beautiful and fair!” and “She’s so 

dark, hopefully the baby won’t be as 
dark,” continue throughout the life 
of a “darker” Indian individual, and 
serve as microaggressions pinning 
a negative connotation on those 
with a darker shade of brown.
Indian society has been primed 
for years with the notion that fair-
er skin is simply better. It means 
you’re more attractive, a more 
desirable spouse and even a more 
sought out employee or leader. But 
where does this colorism come 
from? Some scholars point to 
Ancient India and the construction 
of the caste system, which divided 
labor among different groups with 
the intention that each class had an 
equally important role to society. 
Yet as time passed, misinterpreta-
tion occurred. Higher status went 
to more “noble” occupations — reli-
gious Brahmins, education related 
jobs — and lower status belonged 
to those who worked dirtier, more 
labor-intensive work outside. And 
as a result of this outdoor work, 
these people naturally became 
darker-skinned. 

tively evade discussion around 
issues, often citing a lack of educa-
tion on the topic as an obstacle for 
productive dialogue. Subsequently, 
a culture of “chill” passivity has 
swept over discussions of race and 
associated injustices. This past 
school year, I occasionally spoke 
about systemic issues of inequality 

like voter suppression, the prison-
industrial complex and discrimina-
tion in healthcare with some of my 
peers, only to be met with little to 
no enthusiasm. Instead, the ensu-
ing conversation was very surface 
level and treated as an afterthought 
to the rest of the discussion. I 
believe we have grown accustomed 

to glossing over the negative details 
and instead become hyper-mellow 
to the point of insensitivity in 
regard to human life. Being “chill” 
means to ignore what’s happening 
around your bubble, to not care and 
to not feel.

Michigan reports two positive 
COVID-19 tests from student athletes

Of 
the 
221 
COVID-19 
tests 
performed 
on 
student-
athletes as Michigan began its 
reintroduction of athletes on 
campus, two came back positive. 
The univeristy did not reveal 
which sport those athletes play, 
but for now only men’s basketball, 
women’s basketball and football 
athletes are allowed back on 
campus.
“To date we’ve performed 221 
tests, and we’ve had 2 positive 
results on student-athletes,” head 
team physician Dr. Sami Rifat said 
in a Zoom conference Thursday. 
“Both of those individuals were 
completely asymptomatic at the 
time of the testing. None of our 
staff have tested positive to date.”
Those numbers align with 
the 
percentage 
of 
cases 
in 
Washtenaw county, which is 
hovering at around 0.46 percent 
of the population.
“We know from our local 
hospitals that screen everybody 
that’s coming in for procedures 
that they’re coming in at about 
1 percent,” Rifat said. “So in our 
community here. So we kind of 
expect that to be the number that 
we see and right now we’re just 
about at that number.”
The news comes as other 
universities around the country 
recall their athletes for voluntary 

workouts, with Texas reporting 
13 of its football players tested 
positive. The tests are a part 
of Michigan’s move towards 
allowing athletes back on campus 
and were caught prior to any use 
of athletic facilities.
As a part of the athletic 
department’s 
plan 
to 
limit 
and 
react 
to 
positive 
tests, 
the university will cooperate 
with 
Washtenaw 
county’s 
Environmental Health and Safety 
department 
on 
implementing 
contact-tracing within campus. 
For now, they will not be using 
any contact-tracing apps, but 
officials emphasized the fluidity 
of the situation.
Should 
an 
individual 
test 
positive outside of their initial test 
and quarantine upon return to 
campus, the athletic department 
will work to quarantine that 
individual and any close-or-
immediate contacts until they 
are no longer contagious.
“They 
will 
be 
contacted 
by a slew of people on a daily 
basis,” senior associate athletic 
director Darryl Conway said 
on the same Zoom call. “Their 
athletic trainer will check in 
on them every single day. The 
team dietitian will check in with 
them. Their academic counselor 
will check in with them to make 
sure they’re staying up from 
an academic stand point. And 
then we’ll do everything we can 

to address their mental health, 
so our athletic counselors will 
also check in with them to make 
sure their mental health is being 
addressed.”
Additionally, Conway noted, 
the University has established 
a network of communication 
between 
coaches, 
players, 
trainers 
and 
administration 
should any player test positive 
in order to keep every person as 
informed as possible.
As 
more 
student-athletes 
return to campus, more will test 
positive for COVID-19. Michigan 
hopes the protocols it’s taken will 
not only prevent the introduction 
of the virus into its athletic 
spaces, but will halt its spread 
should 
an 
already-introduced 
athlete contract it through open 
communication 
with 
campus, 
teams and player personnel.

‘M’ not planning to 
isolate student athletes

In response to Dr. Anthony 
Fauci’s statement Tuesday about the 
safety of sports returning and the 
idea that teams need a ‘bubble’ to 
play safely, athletic director Warde 
Manuel was clear:
“We will not isolate our student 
athletes … They are not professionals 
and we won’t get into a situation 
where we are placing them into a 
hotel continuously to isolate them 
from their fellow students and 
whomever else.”
Manuel just doesn’t see that as 
any part of the athletic department’s 
future plans, no matter who said it 
might be necessary. 
“If that is the only way that we 
have to proceed, then we have to 
make other decisions,” Manuel said 
in a press conference Thursday 

afternoon.
He was not clear on what 
‘other decisions’ may entail and 
whether or not those decisions 
would directly impact whether fall 
sports, including football, would be 
played. In a constantly fluctuating 
offseason, those decisions will only 
become clear as time passes, and the 
only thing to do currently is wait.
“We are waiting. We’ve waited 
this long,” Manuel said. “As we move 
forward, we are trying to slow our 
decision making while increasingly 
looking at every piece of information 
and talking through all of the details 
that go on.”
A large piece of information that 
will impact the athletics decision 
is 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s pending decision on 
students’ ability to return to campus 
this fall. Schlissel has already stated 
that if students do not return, 
neither will sports.
“I stand by that statement and I 
think he stands by his statement,” 
Manuel said. “ … If it’s declared that 
our students can’t come back to 
campus for class, why would I ask 
my student athletes to come back 
and participate in sports? It’s against 
how I think about our student 
athletes. They are students first.
“ … (Schlissel) was on the same 
page as me from day one.”
Manuel’s stance on both issues 
boils down rather simply: athletes 
are part of the student body, and 
separating them from it for athletics 

News about upcoming season to come in late June, early July

With Michigan allowing football 
and men’s and women’s basketball 
student-athletes back on campus for 
voluntary workouts, eyes are now 
turning towards the result of that 
offseason training: a season. Still, for 
now, there are no answers on what a 
football season will look like.
“We’re working, and I hope that 
we can move forward and start 
competitions in the fall,” athletic 
director Warde Manuel said in a Zoom 
call with reporters on Thursday. “I’m 
hopeful that the decision will come 
towards the end of this month or early 
July.”
Currently, with programs across 

the country welcoming athletes back, 
the general consensus is that there will 
be a football season. The only question 
is what it will look like in terms of fan 
presence.
“I can tell you it won’t be normal,” 
Manuel said. “We won’t have 110,000 
people in Michigan stadium this year. 

That’s a definitive. Will it be 50 percent 
or 30 percent or 20 percent or 10 or 0, 
I’m not sure. That’ll be a combination 
of listening to our public health 
officials on the capacity our stadium 
can handle given the direction that is 
put out by the governor’s office or the 
university.”

Governor Greg Abbott of Texas is 
allowing stadiums to hold 50 percent 
of their capacity, despite health 
officials warning of its dangers. 
Michigan, though, responded to 
COVID-19 in a much stronger manner 
than Texas, and it’s unlikely that 
Michigan Stadium will hold 50,000 
people on a Saturday this year, despite 
the rate of new cases steadily declining 
over the past two months.
Still, 
Manuel 
emphasized 
throughout his Zoom call the fluidity 
of the situation, and the past three 
weeks have proven that statement 
to be true. With massive protests 
for racial justice across the country 
congregating large amounts of people, 
the results of those gatherings and 
the transmission of COVID-19 will 

become clearer, perhaps educating 
officials on the amount of fans allowed 
safely within a stadium.
“As soon as we have more definitive 
answers about the season, what 
it’ll look like, those types of things,” 
Manuel said. “Then we can implement 
many of the different models we have 
in place for ticketing, operations and 
participation.”
Football makes up a large part of 
the athletic department’s revenue and 
the loss of any ticket sales will have 
massive repercussions for its operating 
budget, 
with 
the 
consequences 
unknown.
For now, though, the resocialization 
of student-athletes brings the promise 
of fall sports and football. In late June 
or July, we’ll know what it’ll look like.

Joe Donovan and Matt Schmidt sign minor league contracts

Junior catcher Joe Donovan and 
redshirt-senior infielder Matthew 
Schmidt became the fifth and sixth 
players from Michigan baseball to 
join the professional ranks, signing 
with Cleveland Tuesday and Kansas 
City Wednesday, respectively, as 
undrafted free agents.
Donovan and Schmidt join the 
other four Wolverines — junior 
right-hander Jeff Criswell, junior 
shortstop 
Jack 
Blomgren, 
and 
junior outfielders Jesse Franklin 
and Jordan Nwogu — who were 
drafted June 11.
Donovan was drafted in the 33rd 
round by the Chicago Cubs in 2017 
and would have almost certainly 
been the fifth Wolverine drafted in 
2020, with early draft projections 
marking him as an eighth to 
twelfth round selection, but the 
COVID-19-induced 
shortening 
of the 2020 draft from 40 to five 
rounds resulted in Donovan’s road 
to professional baseball taking an 
unexpected turn.

Donovan’s .228 career batting 
average and 10 homeruns over 
his 92 game collegiate career do 
not jump off of the page, but his 
impressive arm strength embodies 
the defensive prowess that MLB 
teams typically look for in their 
catchers. Donovan threw out 46 
percent of would-be-base-stealers 
in the abridged 2020 season, and 
the Indians will certainly be hoping 
Donovan can translate that rate of 
success to the next level.
And 
while 
his 
offensive 
numbers may not be eye-popping, 
he has proven to have a knack 
for delivering at the plate in big 
moments, especially over the course 
of Michigan’s 2019 postseason run. 
Those moments may not always 
show up on the stat sheet, but 
Donovan provided tangible value 
with the insurance run he created 
by hitting a sacrifice fly in the 
ninth inning against No. 1 UCLA 
in the Super Regional, and with his 
homerun in the eighth inning of the 
Wolverines’ lone victory over No. 
2 Vanderbilt in the Men’s College 
World Series final.

Overall, 
Donovan 
shows 
potential to grow into the sort of 
defensive cornerstone teams hope 
for their catchers to be and has 
proven an ability at the collegiate 
level to provide the clutch offensive 
production that those same teams 
see as a bonus.
Donovan earned considerable 
playing time over the course of the 
three years he spent in Ann Arbor, 
but Schmidt’s collegiate career 
followed a different path. 
Schmidt began his college career 
at the University of Texas then 
transferred to Cypress College for 
two years before making his final 
move to Michigan prior to the 
2018 season. He started just eight 
games in his first two seasons in 
Ann Arbor and batted .158 over 
the course of those two years. The 
2020 season represented Schmidt’s 
chance to show what he could do 
at the plate and in the field when 
given regular playing time, and he 
made enough of a mark in twelve 
games played to earn a contract 
from the Royals.
Schmidt earned a mere .212 

batting average in 2020, but the 
towering ninth-inning home run 
he hit against then-No. 2 Vanderbilt 
in the season opener suggests he 
is capable of hitting against elite 
pitchers. 
Early season hitting numbers are 

quite volatile, so it is possible that 
Schmidt’s average would’ve gone 
up as he adjusted to his starting 
role. 
Regardless, 
the 
Royals 
clearly saw enough talent and 
improvement to give him a chance 
at the professional level.

Athletes are back: Michigan’s plan for safe resocialization

On 
Monday, 
the 
University 
announced 
football, 
men’s 
basketball and women’s basketball 
teams can return for voluntary 
workouts. Before the athletes can 

participate, however, they will first 
have to go through the athletic 
department’s 
14-day 
pre-report 
assessment, followed by a six-day 
resocialization period.
The 14-day pre-assessment is 
conducted before the athletes take a 
single step into the team’s facilities. 

In this period, a text message is sent 
out every morning asking questions 
as they relate to travel locations, 
any feeling of symptoms, mental 
health and anxiety levels, sleep and 
diet. The answers are reviewed by 
athletic trainers that are prepared 
to intervene depending on the 
athletes’ responses.
After that period, they may 
begin the resocialization process; 
the design of which was guided by 
NCAA, NFL and NBA guidelines as 
well as local public health experts 
at the University of Michigan.
On 
what 
associate 
athletic 
director Darryl Conway calls day 
zero, the athletes will report to 
University Health Services for 
testing.
“They will get two COVID tests,” 
Conway said in a press conference 
Thursday afternoon. “One being 
the viral PCR test that actually tests 
for presence of the virus, and the 
other being a serology or antibody 
test.”
Following 
these 
tests, 
the 
athletes will enter a shelter in 
place period in which they will 
have virtual education sessions 

and review their health history 
with their athletic trainer. These 
sessions will last until day three.
On day four of the resocialization 
process, COVID-19-specific tests 
will be conducted along with EKGs 
and team physical clearances that 
include concussion testing and 
body composition tests.
Starting on the fifth day, sport-
specific fitness will begin. Strength 
and flexibility testing will be the 
bulk of what’s on the athletes’ 
schedules for both the fifth and 
sixth day of resocialization.
On day seven, the resocialization 
process is concluded and strength 
and athletic training starts in a 
program designed to ramp up, 
eventually 
getting 
all 
athletes 
attending their voluntary workouts 
to 100 percent. All athletes and 
coaches are still subject to daily 
screening and required to adhere 
to 
policies 
regarding 
masks, 
social distancing and proper hand 
hygiene.
This policy, in the absence of 
a waiver, acts as protocol to keep 
student athletes safe and informed, 
and all athletes are expected to 

adhere to it — failing to will result 
in repercussions.
“We will treat it like if somebody 
else breaks a team rule,” athletic 
director Warde Manuel said. “We 
will talk to them, we will try to 
educate them and we will try to 
get them to where we are. But 
continued disregard of the policies, 
procedures and protocols that are 
in place could lead up to removal 
from the team.”
The 
future 
introduction 
of 
athletes hinges on the viability 
of this process that Michigan is 
currently putting to the test.
“We will evaluate what it’s 
looked like over the next couple of 
weeks,” Manuel said. “Then look to 
possibly bring back (more athletes), 
starting with our fall sports, in the 
beginning of July after the July 4 
holiday.”
The 
first 
phase 
is 
already 
underway, and the relative success 
— or failure — will be determined 
over the next few weeks. The final 
verdict will be paramount for all 
decisions pertaining to athletics for 
the remaining part of the summer 
and into fall.

Experiencing my small town’s Black Lives Matter protests

I grew up in Chelsea Michigan, a 
small town 20 minutes away from 
Ann Arbor. Chelsea is a racially 
homogenous 
community, 
and 
has very few minorities, so when 
protests for Black Lives Matter 
started happening in the end of 
May, I never thought they would 
happen in my community. Sure, 
I expected a few small isolated 
protests to pop up, but not much 
more than that. But much to my 
surprise, my town was holding a 
rally against racism in a local park. 
I packed up my camera and drove 
into town 30 minutes after the set 
start time, because I truly believed 
it would be a measly showing 
of some high school and college 
students.
When I passed Pierce Park, I was 
astonished. There were a couple 
hundred people, all six feet apart, 
in a circle around a microphone, 
where various members of the 
community spoke. I just couldn’t 
believe it. The age of attendees 
ranged from infants to senior 
citizens. The biggest surprise was 
how many older members of the 
community came to show their 
support.
I have never seen my small, 
white community come together 
like this before, unless it was for a 
high school football game, or the 
Christmas parade. The protest 
remained peaceful, everyone sat 
and did not move until the speakers 
were finished. Then, a small group 
of mostly high school and college 
students marched down Main 
Street. I figured that night was 
the end of it. Everyone showed up 
to support the community and we 
would never speak of it again. I was 
happily surprised by my town.

But later that day, I received 
several 
texts 
about 
a 
march 
planned for exactly a week later. I 
was once again surprised. I arrived 
at the starting location for the 
march (earlier this time) and there 
were less people than the rally, 
most likely because a march does 
not allow for any social distancing 
and did not allow the older or at risk 
populations to participate in the 
same capacity as the week before. 
The crowd gathered in Pierce 
Park, the location of the rally the 
week before, and were briefed about 
the route that they were planning 
on following. There were no official 
organizers of this protest.
They then promptly started 
marching right down Main Street, 
in the heart of our town. They were 
chanting loud enough for the whole 
town to hear.
Chelsea is known for two major 
landmarks, 
the 
Clock 
Tower 
standing on Main Street and the 
Jiffy Mix Factory (the only one in 
the world). The normally peaceful 
downtown disrupted with cries 
for change and justice. It was very 
powerful to see the protesters 
march down Main Street, passing 
these large icons of our town. 
Store owners looked through their 

windows at the protesters and 
people in cars stopped to raise their 
fists.
The protest then turned off 
Main Street and went through 
neighborhoods downtown, where 
houses had people came outside to 
see what was going on. Most people 
were cheering for the protestors 
and were looking on proudly of 
what their community was doing. 
The march picked up many people 
along the way that joined their 
cause as well.
The crowd became louder and 
louder as the march went on, 
shouting “say their names,” “no 
justice, no peace” and “these racist 
cops have got to go.”
The 
route 
ended 
in 
front 
of 
a 
Chelsea 
High 
School’s 
administrator home, to send a 
message of how change needs to 
start in the education system, while 
children are learning how they see 
the world, and our school systems 
need to lead by example. The crowd 
was now much bigger than when 
they started, now at about 100-150 
people.
The group then circled back and 
ended right where they started for 
an open mic.
I was incredibly moved by Diarra 
Seye, who spoke of her experience 
at Chelsea as one of the only black 
students, and as a Black woman 
living in America.
I never realized the treatment 
she was getting, when I was right 
inside the building with her. We 
were even in the tennis program 
together. “I don’t see my color 
but everyone else does, I feel like 
a normal person,” she remarked. 
What resonated with me the most 
was: “I didn’t know that people in 
Chelsea actually cared,” which was 
my attitude as well, but seeing how 
proud she was of our community 
made me so proud to be a part of it.
