UNIVERSITY'S BOARD OF REGENTS
Regents OK Big ouse lights

At meeting, board
also condemns
character attacks in
campus community
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
During its monthly meet-
ing yesterday, the University's
Board of Regents unanimously
approved a proposal to install
permanent field lights at Michi-
gan Stadium.
In the past, temporary light-

ing has been brought in to illu-
minate the Big House for late
afternoon games. With an out-
door hockey
game at the sta- NOTEBOOK
dium slated for
December and a football game to
be played at night next season,
advocates of the project - that
has a $1.8 million budget - said
the lights would be used fairly
regularly.
In an Athletic Department
press release, distributed yes-
terday, Athletic Director David
Brandon said the new lights
will greatly improve fans' and
players' experiences at the Big

House.
"The addition of permanent
lights will improve the qual-
ity of viewing experience for
our fans," Brandon wrote in the
release. "We take great pride in
having the best game day expe-
rience in college football and
this will further enhance that
position."
The permanent lights will
also result in both short-term
and long-term dollar savings,
according to Brandon's state-
ment.
"Short term there will be a
cost savings on the rental fee
associated with bringing in

lights for the Big Chill and long-
term it eliminates the need for
lights to be brought in every
time we play a 3:30 p.m. football
game," Brandon wrote.
The lights are expected to be
installed in time for the Big Chill
at the Big House, which will be
played on Dec. 11, according to
the press release. And the Sept.
10, 2011 football game against
Notre Dame will be the first
home night game in the history
of the Michigan football pro-
gram. The University has previ-
ously played 33 night games at
away or neutral sites.

Research spending
for fiscal year 2010
increased 12.1
percent over last year
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
After breaking the billion-dollar
mark in 2009, research spending at
the University continued to climb
over the last year, setting a new
institutional record.
University research spending
rose 12.1 percent last year, increas-
ing from $1.02 billion in fiscal 'year
2009 to $1.14 billion in fiscal year
2010, Stephen Forrest, the Univer-
siky's vice president for research,
announced at yesterday's Board of
Regents meeting. The 2010 fiscal
year ended in June.
And while theincreaseis impres-
sive, Forrest explained that 1.1
percent of the increased research
funding was the result of stimulus
funding, while the remaining 7 per-
cent was from conventional funding
sources.
Funding from federal govern-
ment sources rose 14.7 percent over
the past year. The National Insti-
tutes of Health increased research

funding to the University by about
20 percent and the Department of
Energy increased its funding by 25
percent.
Funding from the Department
of Homeland Security also jumped
dramatically from last year, from
$L6 million in 2009 to $2.5 million
in 2010. Similarly, funding from
the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion and the Agency for Interna-
tional Development also increased
by more than 50 percent in the past
year,increasing by 57 percent and 78
percent, respectively.
However, the University lost
ground in the research funding it
received from non-federal sources,
which include industry organiza-
tions, non-profits and state and
international governments.
Gifts from public charities rose
by approximately $2.5 million last
year, a 20-percent increase from
2009. And while support from inter-
national organizations rose by 76
percent; from $140,000 in 2009 to
$246,00 in 2010, the increase was
outpaced by a 67-percent loss in
revenue from foreign governments,
which resulted in a $498,000 drop
in research funding.
Overall, research funding from
non-federal sources fell by 4.7 per-
cent between the 2009 and 2010

MICHIGAN IN WASHINGTON
Morrison: Sen. panel 'owes it' toy
patients to fund stem cell work

Panel votes to
temporarily revoke
injunction that
blocked funding
By LILLIAN XIAO
Daily StaffReporter
Sean Morrison, director of the
University's Center for Stem Cell
Biology, appeared before a Sen-
ate subcommittee in Washington
D.C. yesterday to testify in favor
of continuing federal funding for
e9bryonic stem cell research.

At the hearing, titled "The
Promise of Human Embryonic
Stem Cell Research," the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee
on Labor, Health and Human
Services, Education and Related
Agencies decided to continue
federal funding for stem cell
research until further legislative
decisions can be made. The sub-
committee ruled to temporarily
revoke the injunction established'
in August by U.S. District Court
Judge Royce Lamberth, which
blocked federal fundingofhuman
embryonic stem cell research.
Lamberth ruled that the
Obama administration's deci-

sion to expand federal funding
in March 2009 was illegal under
the Dickey-Wicker Amendment,
which restricts the use of tax-
payers' dollars to fund research
involving the destruction of
human embryos.
In 2007 President Bush issued
an executive order, which lim-
ited the number of stem cell
lines available to researchers. In
a statement last night, U.S. Sen.
Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) wrote
that Obama's repeal of the ban
brought hope that stem cell
researchers could expand their
work without fear of legal rami-

Club known for
Thursday night
scene closed doors
suddenly in June
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
For some students, Thursday
nights in Ann Arbor may now be
changed forever.
Local nightclub Studio 4 -
located at 314 South Fourth Ave.

- abruptly closed on June 3, and
the once solid black front has now
been painted orange, with no clear
physical signs to indicate what
may become of the space.
City attorney Kristen Larcom,
who's managing the case, said
the closure comes in connection
with a pending public nuisance
lawsuit filed against Papa Chulo's,
the company that subleases the
address, in addition to the club's
operator, Vickash Mangray of
V.R. Entertainment Network, Inc.,
and Dennis Serras, the property
owner. The lawsuit was finalized

on Feb. 19, 2010.
According to a June 21 AnnAr-
bor.com article, a fight occurred
at Studio 4 the day before the club
closed. Three people, including
one in possession of a handgun,
were arrested on June 2, the arti-
cle states.
According to the lawsuit, which
was provided to The Michigan
Daily by Larcom, there have been
more than 200 logged calls to the
Ann Arbor Police Department
regarding Studio 4 since Septem-
ber 2007. The majority of these

Obama promises to push DREAM Act.

White House aims to
help foreign college
students, soldiers
become citizens
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama is promising
to work with senators to help pass
legislation allowing thousands of
young people who attend college
or join the military to become
legal U.S. residents, according
to Hispanic lawmakers who met
yesterday with the president.
"The president made it abso-
lutely clear to us that he would
leave no stone unturned" in push-
ing for Senate approval of what's
known as the DREAM Act, Rep.
Luis Gutierrez, D-Calif., said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid, D-Nev., has said he wants
to add the immigration measure
to a defense policy bill the Senate
plans to take up before lawmak-
ers leave town to campaign for
the November elections.
Republicans oppose that move
and have accused Reid of playing
politics with the bills.
Some military leaders support

Reid because of the recruitment
potential for the armed ser-
vices. Under the bill, the young
people must have come to the
U.S. before age 16 and have lived
here for five years. At least two
years of military service would
be required.
"The president noted that it is
time to stop punishing innocent
young people for the actions of
their parents, especially when
those youth grew up in America
and want to serve this country in
the military or pursue a higher
education," the White House
said in a statement after Obama's
meeting at the White House with
Gutierrez, Rep. Nydia Velazquez,
D-N.Y., and Sen. Robert Menen-
dez, D-N.J.
When Obama was a senator
he supported the DREAM Act,
which has been kicking around
Congress for nearly a decade.
The meeting followed Obama's
speech Wednesday night at a
Hispanic awards dinner, where
he urged Latinos not to punish
Democrats at the polls because
he's been unable to keep his
promise to sign a comprehensive
immigration bill into law.
Advocates, meanwhile, are

launching a major lobbying effort
for DREAM, enlisting educators,
clergy and others to press sena-
tors to back the measure.
Velazquez said passing the bill
"is the right thing to do. It's a
matter of fairness for thousands
and thousands of young kids"
who entered the country illegally
with their families: She and oth-
ers say they should not be pun-
ished.
Republicans contend that the
bill rewards law breakers.
"The DREAM Act is yet anoth-
er attempt by Washington Demo-
crats to grant amnesty to illegal
immigrants who have broken our
laws," said Rep. Phil Gingrey,
R-Ga.
Carlos Saavedra, national
coordinator of United We Dream,
a coalition of student immigrant
advocacy groups, said voters
who care about the issue will be
watching how senators vote on
the bill.
"Folks are literally dropping
their lives right now to work on
this," Saavedra said Thursday.
"This is one of our last chances
to get some justice to the immi-
grant community and immigrant
youth. It's huge."

Distraught gunman kills himself,
mother at John Hopkins Hospital

Senate passes $30
billion tax credit for
small businesses

Son reacts to news of
mother's medical
condition, also
shoots surgeon
BALTIMORE (AP) - A man who
became distraught as he was being
briefed on his mother's condition
by a surgeon at Johns Hopkins
Hospital pulled a gun and shot the
doctor yesterday, then killed his
mother and himself in her room at
the world-famous medical center,
police said.
The doctor, who was wounded
in the abdomen, was expected to
survive.
The gunman, 50-year-old Paul
Warren Pardus, had been listen-
!

ing to the surgeon around mid-
day when he "became emotionally
distraught and reacted ... and was
overwhelmed by the news of his
mother's condition," Police Com-
missioner Frederick H. Bealefeld
III said.
Pardus pulled a semiautomatic
gun from his waistband and shot
the doctor once, the commissioner
said. The doctor, identified by col-
leagues as orthopedic surgeon
David B. Cohen, collapsed out-
side the eighth-floor room where
Pardus' mother, 84-year-old Jean
Davis, was being treated.
Pardus then holed up in the
room in a more than two-hour
standoff that led authorities to lock
down a small section of the Nelson
Building while allowing the rest
of the sprawling red-brick medi-

cal complex - a cluster of hospital,
research and education buildings -
to remain open.
When officers made their way to
the room, they found Pardus and
his mother shot to death, he on the
floor, she in her bed.
Bealefeld said he did not know
what the woman was being treated
for at Hopkins, a world-class insti-
tution widely known for its cancer
research and treatment.
It is part of Johns Hopkins
University, which has one of the
foremost medical schools in the
world.
Harry Koffenberger, vice presi-
dent of security, said the hospital
uses handheld metal detectors to
screen patients and visitors known
to be high-risk. However, with
80 entrances and 80,000 visitors

a week, it is not realistic to place
metal detectors and guards every-
where.
"Not in a health-care setting,"
Koffenberger said.
The hospital will review proce-
dures and look again at the use of
metal detectors, he said.
Michelle Burrell, who works in
a coffee shop in the hospital lobby,
said she was told by employees who
were on the floor where the doc-
tor was shot that the gunman was
angry with the doctor's treatment
of his mother.
"It's crazy," she said.
Pardus was from Arlington, Va.,
and had a handgun permit in that
state, police said. The gunman
was initially identified as Warren
Davis, but police later said that was
an alias.

Bill allocates $30
billion for small
business lending
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate has passed a bill to create
a $30 billion government fund
to help open lending for credit-
starved small businesses, cut
their taxes and boost federal loan
programs for them.
The 61-38 tally rewards Presi-
dent Barack Obama and his
Democratic allies of Capitol Hill
with a long-sought victory and
sets the stage for a final vote
in the House, which is likely to
approve it for Obama's signa-

ture.
The new fund would help'
community banks increase lend-
ing to small businesses hurt by
the recession and the 2008 Wall
Street crisis. The bill would also
provide about $12 billion in tax
breaks over a decade to both
large and small businesses and
also boost the Small Business
Administration's lending pro-'
grams.
"At a time when small busi-
ness owners are still struggling
to make payroll and they're
still holding off hiring, we put
together a plan that would give
them some tax relief and make it
easier for them to take out loans,"
Obama said Wednesday.

State community

expand programs
Community colleges would be

House.
The main bill in the package
passed the Democratic-led House
by a 55-49 vote yesterday. It now

The bill would allow the com-
munity colleges, which tradition-
ally offer two-year degrees, to
offer four-year bachelor's degrees
for nursing, culinary arts, cement
technology and maritime technol-

The bills cause some competitive

Obama and Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev signed the
treaty in April. It would shrink
the limit on strategic warheads to
1,550 for each country, down about
a third from the current ceiling
of 2,200. It also would imple-

Key to peace talk
progress: Israel's
settlements

Israel pressured
to halt settlement
construction
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) - Two
days of Mideast peace talks
appear to have brought Israel
and the Palestinians closer to a
deal that would allow those talks
to continue, but even if the nego-
tiations move forward far more
difficult issues lay ahead.
Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak suggested a compro-
mise over Israel's plan to lift its
partial ban on construction on
the West Bank later this month,
while Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas said yesterday
he sees no alternative to con-
tinuing negotiations in search of
peace with Israel.
U.S. Secretary of State Hill-
ary Clinton, speakingin Amman,
said she is convinced that Netan-
yahu and Abbas are trying to
seek common ground.
"They are committed and they
have begun to grapple with the
hard but necessary questions,"
she said, shortly before leaving
for the U.S. "I am convinced that
this is the time and these are the
leaders to achieve the result we
all seek."
Abbas' comments came as
Israel was coming under increas-
ing pressure to extend its curb
on Jewish settlement construc-
tion, and aides to the Palestinian
leader suggested there might be
movement toward a compromise
on that issue.
Abbas had said previously that
the talks could not survive if the
Israeli building restrictions were
lifted as planned.
"We all know there is no alter-
native to peace through negotia-
tions, so we have no alternative
other than to continue these
efforts," Abbas said yesterday,
speaking through an inter-
preter in Ramallah, where the
headquarters of the Palestinian
National Authority is located.
It was unclear from Abbas'
remarks whether he was signal-
ing that the Palestinians would
remain committed to the talks
even if Israel does not extend the
limits on building.
Egypt's leader said in a radio
interview that he urged Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu to extend the restrictions
for three more months to give
peacemaking a chance.
Mubarak said he told Netan-
yahu the delay could give the
two sides time to draft their
future borders. After those lines
are agreed, Mubarak reasoned,

After receiving the scholar-
ship, Montague thanked his
professors and the ASF for the
award. He said he was overjoyed
that Worden had come to person-
ally deliver the grant.
"I know math isn't necessarily

the most excitingfield, especially
compared to a space launch from
earth," he said. "ButI'll try to live
up to your expectations in what-
ever way that Ican."
In an interview after the pre-
sentation, Montague, who says
he plans to enter academia, said
he will most likely use the schol-
arship money to help pay for
graduate school.
After the scholarship pre-
sentation, Worden detailed his
experiences aboard Apollo 15,
in which he logged nearly 300
days in space, and showed photo-
graphs from the flight.
Thirty-nine years ago, at age
39, Worden traveled aboard
Apollo 15 with David Scott and
James B. Irwin - also both Uni-
versity alumni.
"We are all Michigan gradu-
ates and that's the thing we are
most proud of," he said. "Those
of you who watch the football
games on television instead of
going to the Big House will see us
at all of the games."
Worden also told the audience
about the preparation for the
flight, which involved simula-
tions of the launch. After detail-
ing the morning of the launch, he
played the 9:34 a.m. launch tape,
allowing audience members to

within theirs.
In comments to Israel's Chan-
nel 10 before she left the region,
Clinton said for the first time
that the U.S. would back a lim-
ited extension of the partial con-
struction moratorium, calling
the idea "extremely useful."
"I don't think a limited exten-
sion would undermine the pro-
cess going forward if there were
a decision agreed to by both par-
ties," she said.
Netanyahu's office said yes-
terday that Israel doesn't plan to
extend the current limits, which
are due to expire in late September.
But Israeli officials said they
hoped to reach a compromise
well before the current restric-
tions expire on Sept. 26 in hopes
of avoiding a major crisis. The
officials spoke on condition of
anonymity because no formal
decisions have been made.
Aides to Abbas said no deal
had been reached on the settle-
ment issue, but said they accept
Mubarak's proposal and expect
that a compromise will be found.
Previously, the Palestinians
have said they would walk out
on the talks if any construction
resumes.
The aides spoke on condition
of anonymity because they were
discussing a sensitive diplomatic
matter.
Michele Dunne, a Mideast
.expert at the Carnegie Endow-
ment for International Peace,
said Thursday the talks appear to
have edged the process forward,
although bigger challenges lay
ahead.
The discussions in Egypt's
Sharm el-Sheikh and Jerusalem
"got the talks rolling toward
a possible compromise on the
settlements moratorium issue,
which probably will be reached
over the next week or so," she
said. "But once again the parties
are spending weeks dealing with
a short-term issue to avert a cri-
sis rather than getting down to
the larger problems."
Yesterday, Clinton and Abbas
met at the Palestinian Author-
ity's West Bank headquarters.
Abbas thanked the Obama
administration for its efforts to
broker the current talks, the first
in two years. "I know that this
time is difficult and the circum-
stances are difficult, but tlieAmer-
icans are exerting active efforts to
achieve this peace," he said.
Later, Clinton traveled to
Amman for lunch with Jordan's
King Abdullah, whose country
already has a peace treaty with
Israel and is a strong support-
er of efforts to work out a deal
between Israel and the Palestin-
ians.
listen firsthand to the experi-
ence.
Worden said he wouldn't have
been able to reach the moon
without his University educa-
tion.
"You don't need an education
to drive a car or a plane," he said.
"But you need one for space-
crafts. We don't just fly machines
so it takes alot of time and effort
and a good education."
After the presentation, Wor-
den said in an interview that he
didn't always know he wanted
to be an astronaut. He said he

originally planned to be a test
pilot and applied to the astro-
naut program essentially on a
whim.
"I just tried to do what I could
to get as far as I could in my own
profession," he said. "And what I
found was that if you work hard
in your field, and if you do well,
lots of doors will open."
Worden said that what he
remembered most during his
time at the University was the
intense level of coursework.
"Friday night to Sunday after-
noon it was study, study, study,"
he said. "I spent every weekend
studying because I always had so
much catching up to do."
Worden offered a few words of
advice for students.
"It sounds trite but it's the
truth that you get what you
deserve out of life," he said.
"The harder you work to achieve
something, the better off you're
going to be once you get there."
A strong education is the most
important part of securing a suc-
cessful future, he added.
"Don't be satisfied with a lazy
education," he said. "Go outthere
and get it."

Simulate Survival Flight
UMHS needs to use humane methods of teaching
T he University has recently come under fire from a national
animal rights organization for teaching methods that are
far from progressive. People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals filed a complaint against the University of Michigan Health
Services for using cats and pigs to help train prospective nurses in
its Survival Flight course. Despite the existence of more humane
options for training nursing students, the University is continuing
to perform simulations with animals. Regardless of the legality of
the use of animals, UMHS should still consider other, more humane
methods of training. UMHS should use medical simulators as the
preferred method of training.

PETA filed a complaint with the Unit-
ed States Department of Agriculture last
week, urging it to investigate UHMS's use
of cats and pigs to practice intubation and
other procedures. PETA alleges that the
use of cats and pigs for training purposes
in the Survival Flight course breaches the
Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as reported
by the Daily on Monday. UMHS defended
the training method and stated that it had
increased the use of human patient simu-
lators and decreased the use of animals in
its training courses. UMHS also said that
the procedures were similar to ones per-
formed .by veterinarians when treating
animals in the clinic and that most of the
cats used were adopted afterward.
The legality of UHMS's use of cats and
pigs is still up for debate. But regardless
of the USDA's investigation, the Univer-
sity should reevaluate teaching methods
that involve the use of animals. Though we
want our doctors and nurses to be as well
trained as possible, training should also be
humane. Since other options exist, UMHS
shouldn't use pigs and cats as a default
training method.
One technique that can likely replace the
use of animals is the use of human patient
simulators. A simulator has the advantage
of being able to replicate the anatomy of a

human body far more accurately than a cat
or pig. These simulators allow students to
get thorough and accurate training, while
also approaching their education in a
humane way. UMHS should use its human
simulator, called the TraumaMan System,
to help train nurses. And if the Trauma-
Man system isn't appropriate for the pur-
poses of the Survival Flight course, UMHS
should invest in research to develop a bet-
ter simulator.
This is not the first time that the Univer-
sity has been investigated for unethical uses
of animals in courses. In 2009, PETA filed
a complaint saying that a different UMHS
course was using dogs to practice proce-
dures to treat trauma injuries. That filing
led to weeks of scandal and debate. These
complaints and lawsuits shouldn't be part of
the culture at the University. They are costly,
time consuming and cast a negative light on
otherwise positive studies and training. But
mostly, they are unnecessary because other
options are available.
UMHS courses should continue their
tradition of excellence. But the future
of medical training doesn't lie with the
use of animals. Rather, it will be based in
advanced human patient simulation tech-
nology. That is where UMHS should direct
its resources.

It's been two weeks or so since
you've finally arrived. You spent
your summer whining to all your
friends how you
couldn't "wait to
go to school," and
chafed at your par-
ents' mandate that
you spend time
with your grand-
parents, your little
sister or - heaven
forbid - them. You
have your TCF VANESSA
hoodies, M-plan-
ners, your crew RYCHLINSKI
from your resi-
dence hall and your
bright-eyed zeal. Gone now are the
pre-socialization jitters about room-
mates and evening plans. The awk-
ward dust from being thrown from
the safe - if somewhat constricting
- arms of your parents into your new
lives has finally settled. Are you as
blissfully free as you had imagined?
Probably not. It happened to all
of us. The first week is a whirlwind
of moving in, welcome week and the
first few days of classes. Then, sud-
denly, you have a new pressurized
song and dance - one of homework,
extracurriculars and planning for
your future. Now is the time of mass
meetings, mixers, CTools assign-
ments and schedules.
This time last year, I was fresh
from a land of all girls and plaid
uniforms. As you can imagine, Ann
Arbor became my playground. I'm
not going to sit here rattling off ways
to "get involved" through clubs, tell
you about the many places to study
and wax nostalgic about community
center activities or whatever. Instead,
my advice is to do absolutely nothing.
On its website, the Office of New
Student Programs "strongly [encour-

ages you] to take advantage of every-
thing the campus and community has
to offer." It's impossible for anyone to
experience "everything" the Univer-
sity has to offer in all of their time as
a student here. Some of the greatest
triumphs of our school --its diversity
and excellence in a myriad fields -
are also what makes it overwhelm-
ing. Last year I deleted almost every
single e-mail regarding dorm events,
clubs that I signed up for and service
opportunities only because of the fact
that it was exhausting. It's ridiculous
how freshmen are continually prod-
ded to "try new things." College is
a new thing, and for many students
it's enough of an adjustment without
worrying about padding a resume for
grad school.
Reasonnumberonetotakeiteasyfor
now: Youjust spent four years tryingto
gethere. Four years ofputtingtogether
the right GPA, test scores, the ideal
blend of activities and finally the per-
fect application. Get out of that mode.
Stop trying to look good on paper. If
you came to the University knowing
exactly your career path, I salute you.
But for therest thathave no idea where
your interests lie, don't look for them
by blindly scrolling through Maize
Pages. Most of you came from high
schools that were rife with cliques,
social mores and an overall identity.
This school is wholly unlike any of
them, and I urge you to find yourself
during your freshman year before you
get lost in the campus culture.
My second reason is that all orga-
nizations on the University cam-
pus are fervently - no, voraciously
- seeking new recruits. Students on
the Diag will attempt to lure you in
almost daily with promises of candy
or a cool-looking game, shouting at
you to join up. Freshmen, pleaseresist
this overachiever-esque, psychologi-

cal bullying. These people seem tobe
gentle, sane creatures, but if you are
apathetic to their aims or maybe just
want a pink Starburst, beware. They
have been known to become hostile.
For example, a girl once yelled at me
for ignoring her, when in fact I had
simply said, "No, thank you," quietly.
A tactic I find works exceptionally
well when pressed with club hecklers
is to hurriedly walk as if angry. It may
not be possible to get to class with-
out having brightly colored papers
forced into your hand, but it's better
than the alternative of falling victim.
Never give out your full name and
guard your uniqname with your life.
I assure you, if you express the least
bit of interest in an organization, you
will be hunted down.
Don't hurry to
get involved your
freshman year.
Save yourself during your fresh-
man year. You're here at the mythical
land of college and you're still pretty
free. Your first year is not the time
to grow up, and chances are you're
still going to have to do some menial
labor this coming summer instead
of an internship in New York or D.C.
or Timbuktu. You have three more
years after this one to figure out the
meaning of "involvement," the right
"career," and the extent of that little
sucker "responsibility." In the mean-
time, go ahead, have a little fun.

'U' needs to stop inhumane
animal training techniques
TO THE DAILY:
By continuing to allow pigs and cats to be
harmed and killed in its Survival Flight course
for nurses, the University - my undergraduate
alma mater - is violating both the spirit and the
letter of federal laws designed to protect animals
in laboratories (PETA files complaint against 'U'
Survival Flight course, 09/13/2010).
The Animal Welfare Act states that animal
use in experiments or training should only be
approved when non-animal methods are "not
available." It's impossible for the University to
meet this burden when evaluating the use of
animals for the life support skills covered in its
Survival Flight course because other Univer-
sity advanced training courses use sophisticated
human patient simulators. Simulation manne-
quins are recognized as the preferred standard
for teaching because they allow trainees to prac-
tice on accurate anatomy and repeat procedures
until they are adept.
Just last year, the University's Graduate Medi-
cal Education Committee announced that simu-
lators would replace the use of animals in the
school's Advanced Trauma Life Support course
- a course for physicians and nurses that covers
the same procedures that pigs are still being cut
up and killed for in.Survival Flight.
When I was a law student at Texas Tech Uni-
versity, the school ended the use of cats for pedi-
atric intubation training. This is the skill that is
still being taught by maiming cats in Survival
Flight even though the University's Pediatric
Advanced Life Support course already teaches
this skill using simulators exclusively.
The use of animals in the Survival Flight
course is morally, scientifically and legally unjus-
tifiable. I hope that the University will take the
high road, admit that it can do better and make
easy - but necessary - curricular changes that
benefit humans and animals. Until then, I've
given up my membership to the Alumni Associa-
tion and have let the school know not to expect
any more checks. I hope people follow suit.

RecycleBank is flawed in
spite of incentive program
TO THE DAILY:
Wednesday's editorial gave an overly sim-
plistic view of the RecycleBank incentive pro-
gram (Bank on Recycling, 9/15/2010). Though
the initiative will help students' limited bud-
gets, which is great news, the Daily also said
that the program would "promote environ-
mental friendliness." That statement that isn't
necessarily true.
It is a bitter pill to swallow that in many
cases, recycling an item does not make up
for the environmental destruction caused by
manufacturing it - especially when it comes
to plastics. This is true because the bottles and
other items we buy on a daily basis are almost
always made of entirely virgin plastic. When
we recycle them, they are not made into new
plastic bottles. Instead, they are "downcycled"
into lower-quality plastic products which are
later put into landfills. In fact, curbside recy-
cling programs often accept and throw away
plastics that cannot even be recycled, in order
to avoid confusion among consumers. Recy-
cling is critical and can be very effective, but
it's not a perfect system.
Furthermore, since points are accumulated
using a sensor in the bins, people will be tempt-
ed to recycle items that should be put in the
trash (i.e. used napkins, paper towels and food
waste). This is troublesome because spilled
food can ruin paper products and make them
no longer recyclable.
Finally, the RecycleBank program is likely to
encourage overconsumption. Rewarding larg-
er quantities of waste - even if that waste is
recyclable - will only reinforce our obsession
with convenience foods and disposable prod-
ucts. RecycleBank should be regarded with
skepticism. It is, after all, a company looking to
make money, not an objective authority teach-
ing right from wrong.
There are advantages to the RecycleBank
program if it teaches some students to use
their recycling bins and helps them financially.
However, we should always bear in mind that
"reduce" and "reuse" come first for a reason.

The battle for State Street

This summer I sat on a panel of
University students as prospec-
tive applicants asked questions
about what it is
like to be a Wolver-
ine. The panelists I
eagerly jumped at
the opportunities
to explain just what
it's like to live in Ann
Arbor and proud-
ly claim the title'
"Leaders and Best."
But one ques- TYLER
tion caught us off JONES
guard. A prospec-
tive student asked,
"I walk around
State Street on football Saturdays and
I love the atmosphere, but there is so
much drinking everywhere. What is
being done about that?" The five of us
panelists exchanged glances and man-
aged awkward giggles as we fumbled
for a response that could put this appli-
cant's mind at ease. But no answer
came. Instead, the moderator jumped
into action, deflecting the question and
moving the discussion to something
more digestible.
That question lingered with me
because we had no answer. Though
underage drinking occurs on college
campuses across the nation, Univer-
sity officials must not shy away from
developing and enforcing a compre-
hensive plan to combat this problem.
According to collegedrinking-
prevention.gov, roughly 850 college
students between the ages of 18 and
21 died in 2009 as a result of alcohol-
related injuries. That boils down to
about two students each day. Addi-
tionally, about 300,000 students in
that range are injured as a result of
alcohol. That is the equivalent of
about 822 students - or nearly the
entire capacity of East Quad - every
single day. Though the public health
community acknowledges the inher-
ent dangers of underage drinking,
most of society has ignored the sta-

tistics. Underage drinking remains a
staple of football Saturday on cam-
puses across the nation.
The National Institute of Alco-
hol Abuse and Alcoholism says that
roughly 83 percent of college stu-
dents drink. Clearly, this is not a
problem only at the University. But
perhaps the main factor that inhibits
the development of a cohesive plan to
combat underage drinking on campus
is that some simply don't see this epi-
demic as a problem. From my friends
in South Quad last year who were
caught drinking to the parents of high
school friends who sit idly by while
underage drinking occurs in their
homes, alcohol is often seen simply as
a rite of passage for adolescents.
But I don't shake my finger at
underage drinking simply because
it's against the law. If some students
must rely on alcohol during every
football tailgate and late night mixer
to relax, a social crutch is formed and
being truly comfortable in any social
setting without alcohol becomes less
likely. Surgeon General Dr. Kenneth
Moritsugu sumed it up best in his
2007 Call to Action to Prevent and
Reduce Underage Drinking. He said,
"Adolescent alcohol use is not an
acceptable rite of passage but a seri-
ous threat to adolescent development
and health."
Based on the NIAAA's calculations,
roughly 21,000 of Michigan's 26,208
undergraduates drink alcohol. Accord-
ing to a statement released by the
Department of Public Safety, "Begin-
ning September 2 through Septem-
ber 9, 2010, the Washtenaw County
Sheriff's Office and the Saline Police
Department, in partnership with the
University of Michigan Department of
Public Safety, will be on the lookout for
underage drinkers." According to the
press release, "Research and experi-
ence confirm strong enforcement helps
to reduce underage drinking..." Crack-
ing down on underage drinking will
combat, "alcohol poisoning, impaired

driving and suicide," the statement
said. On the first night of the increased
enforcement alone, 48 tickets were
issued and two arrests were made.
This is tremendous progress for
local law enforcement that clearly
recognizes the inherent dangers of
underage drinking. But I can't help but
wonder why this "crackdown" war-
ranted a press release. Is it news that
a law enforcement agency is enforcing
the law? Perhaps if the strict enforce-
ment of the legal drinking age didn't
happen only seven days out of every
school year, this would seem like less of
a headline. One can't help but wonder
if local law enforcement has a plan to
combat this ubiquitous problem for the
remainder of the year.
Underage drinking
is not an adolescent
rite of passage.
I remember when I attended Cam
pus Day my senior year of high school.
Eager to tour the Diag and explore the
ivy-covered buildings, I was instead
greeted with a raucous game of vol-
leyball on State Street and the bitter
smell of stale alcohol. The University
is first and foremost an institution of
higher learning with a long history of
tackling some of the world's toughest
problems. Before we are to meet the
challenges that face the international
community, we must develop a policy
to combat this life-threatening prob-
lem at home. However, if we choose
to sit idly by, we must be prepared to
defend this response to every incom-
ing student who simply wants a world-
class education.

DARLOW, REGENTS
CONDEMN CHARACTER
ATTACKS
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) read a statement at the
start of the meeting yesterday
condemning character attacks on
members of the University com-
munity.
"When any member of the Uni-
versity of Michigan community
is targeted because of his or her
identity, we are all attacked,"
Darlow said. "We know that our
community will continue to stand
together and uphold the Univer-
sity's values with dignity and
respect."
Andrew Shirvell, a civil service
employee in the appellate. divi-
sion of Michigan Attorney Gen-
eral Mike Cox's office, has come
under recent scrutiny for his out-
spoken criticism of Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly President Chris
Armstrong. In his blog, Shirvell
criticizes Armstrong's alleged
"radical homosexual agenda,"
The Michigan Daily reported ear-
lier this week.
Shrivell has also protested at
several campus events where
Armstrong has been present and
spoke during the community con-
cern portion of last week's MSA
meeting, during which he called
for Armstrong's resignation.
Darlow hinted toward
Shirvell's actions by saying that
these are "recent events that con-
cern (the regents) greatly."

University investment proceeds,
the Office of the Vice President
for Research and the College
of Engineering. The project is
scheduled to be finished in the
spring of 2013.
The regents green-lit a $4.9
million renovation to the Aux-
iliary Services Building of the
School of Art and Design. The
renovation will increase studio
and office space by 4o percent
and save the University $114,000
in recurring costs for space that is
currently being leased. The proj-
ect is expected to be finished next
summer.

fiscal years. However, combined
with resources from federal enti-
ties, the University's research
grew 11.8 percent.
The other 0.3 percent of growth
in the University's research bud-
get last year was the result of Uni-
versity funding sources, which
grew by 12.9 percent, from $250
million in 2009 to $282 million in
2010.
University funding sources
don't account for endowment rev-
enue or development activities
that aid research, both of .which
are counted as non-federal fund-
ing sources.
And while continuing to make
double-digit percent gains in
research spending may not be
possible for the University, once
stimulus funding expires, Forrest
said the University is currently
on track to maintain a robust
research budget this year.
"Although it's still early, we
remain on a similar track for (this
year)," he said.
In an interview following yes-

calls were related to liquor license
violations, disorderly conduct,
assault and the request for police
involvement in order to control
crowds, the lawsuit states.
One of these calls to the police
involved complaints of "a large and
rowdy crowd" on Sept. 12, 2009,
according to the lawsuit. There
were between 700 and 800 people,
some of whom became involved in
"physical altercations," according
to the document.
Multiple calls to Mangray, Ser-
ras and representatives from Papa
Chulo's seeking comment went
unreturned.
Now, one year later, the club's
ownership and identity are
unknown. As of last week the only
physical sign of business was locat-
ed inside and read "Dream Niteclub

AnnArbor.com reported on Aug.
26 that the new "Dreamn Niteclub"

terday's meeting, University Pres-
ident Mary Sue Coleman praised
the University's quickly growing
research-spending levels.
"Of course the stimulus fund-
ing is extraordinarily impres-
sive, but what I was even more
impressed with was the underly-
ing 7 and a half percent increase
on just the base," Coleman said.
"Because when you get a base as
big as a billion dollars, to get that
type of a percentage increase is
astonishing."
Coleman added that aside from
the sheer volume of money allo-
cated to research on campus,
it's also important to consider
the implications of the research,
which benefits students and fac-
ulty while also often resulting in
practical applications.
"Because we really focus on
interdisciplinarity across the
institution, getting people togeth-
er, we're able to compete for really
big projects," Coleman said, refer-
encing the $19.5 million grant the
University received from the U.S.
Department of Energy. "I think
it's just tremendous because it
offers more opportunities for our
students to get involved."
was issued a liquor license and was
set to open on Sept. 2. But after
recent observations, there is no evi-
dence that shows the club is up and
running.
The lawsuit also contains a
requirement that Studio 4 close
altogether, or at least be closed on
Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.
LSA junior Jordan Bailey said he
never witnessed any violence at Stu-
dio 4, and it was a fun place to go,
though it wasn't his favorite club.
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance senior Devin Lytle agreed,
saying that Studio 4 was a "cool"
club despite the hearsay about the
various fights that occurred there.
"It's always been a cool place to
be," Lytle said. "I've always went
with a big group of friends, but I've
heard that it could be sketchy."
LSA sophomore Sophia Van Alls-
burg said the club might have an
undeserved negative reputation.
"People who've never been
there think that it's a rough place,
but when I've been there I haven't
experienced that side of it," she
said.

fications.
"At last, we thought, our bright-
est young minds could enter this
field without worrying that they'd
go to the lab one day and find the
doors ordered shut by someone in
Washington D.C.," Harkin wrote.
Harkin, chair of the subcom-
mittee, wrote that Lamberth's
injunction came "out of the blue"
and that decision "placed a cloud
of uncertainty over this entire sci-
entific field."
At the hearing, Morrison cited
the difficulty he faced obtain-
ing NIH funding and approval
to use embryonic stem cell lines
to study Hirschsprung - a birth
defect caused by damaged neural
stem cells, according to a tran-
script of his testimony. Due to the
fluctuations in legislation involv-
ing embryonic stem cell fund-
ing, Morrison said the approval

process suffered repeated delays,
and was finally granted, only to
be stopped by Lamberth's injunc-
tion.
"We owe more to the patients
suffering from incurable diseas-
es," Morrison said in his testimo-
ny. "We owe it to them to support
all forms of stem cell research so
that no matter where the science
leads and where cures come from,
we can follow the most promising
avenues of discovery."
Opponents of federal funding
for embryonic stem cell research
stress there are alternative ways
to research treatments like using
adult stem cells, that do not
involve the use of embryos. How-
ever, Morrison said in his testi-
mony yesterday that the potential
of human embryonic stem cells
for treating disease cannot be
ignored.
"The reality is that many types
of stem cells are likely to yield sci-
entific advances - and potentially
new therapies - and it would be

foolish to place all our bets on
certain stem cells at such an early
stage in the. development of this
field," Morrison said.
In an e-mail interview last
night after his presentation, Mor-
rison wrote that he is worried
Congress will not act soon enough
to permanently overturn Lam-
berth's ruling.
"Although Congress has twice
previously voted to increase fed-
eral funding for human embry-
onic stem cell research, I am
concerned that new legislation
could get delayed by election year
politics," Morrison wrote.
Francis Collins, director of the
National Institutes of Health, also
testified yesterday in front of the
committee. According to a tran-
script of the testimony, Collins
told the committee that he is con-
cerned that the uncertainty of the
field may discourage young scien-
tists from pursing a career in stem
cell research and push current
researchers to move to countries

where research is more accepted.
Collins, a former University
professor, said in his testimony
that the NIH has invested more
than $500 million in human
embryonic stem cell research.
Just last year, the NIH granted
$6.8 million in federal stimulus
funds to University researchers
for stem cell-related projects.
In an NIH statement issued last
week, officials said the consid-
eration of grants, contracts and
applications involving the use of
human embryonic stem cells -
all of which were frozen by the
August injunction - will contin-
ue. The statement highlighted the
importance of stem cell research
for finding treatments for dis-
eases.
"Human embryonic stem cell
research holds the potential for
generating profound new insights
into disease, cell-based thera-
peutics, and novel methods of
screening for new drugs," offi-
cials said in the NIH statement.

Penn State hockey helps Blue, hurts CCHA

ello Penn State, goodbye
CCHA credibility.
Barring a major plot
twist at Penn State's 11:30 am
news confer-
ence today, the
Nittany Lions
will be the
59th team to
join Division
I hockey. But
more impor-
tant, they will
* be the sixth Big MICHAEL
Ten school in FLOREK
the division,
the minimum
required for a conference to have
an automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament.
With the Big Ten surely salivat-
ing over the broadcast potential
for its growing cable network and
rumors that Indiana is looking
into following Penn State's path,
it seems like only a matter of time
before the conference is a reality.
So what does this all mean for
Michigan?
The program is about to get a
lot richer. The Big Ten Network
has become the Rich Uncle Pen-

nybags of the college sports world,
dangling enough cash out there for
Nebraska to turn to the Big Ten in
football. Big Ten hockey presents
yet another programming oppor-
tunity to draw serious revenues
for the conference and its member
schools.
But the Wolverines may get
richer talent-wise as well. At
worst, the Big Ten Network will
feature a game-of-the-week giving
the conference 19 televised regular
season games, eight more than the
Fox Sports Detroit contract for the
upcoming season. And with fewer
teams in the conference, Michigan
has a higher chance of playing in
these games.
While the increased exposure
helps out Penn State and college
hockey asa whole, a little extra
television time won't hurt when
recruiting comes around for the
Wolverines.
The only con from a Michi-
gan fan's perspective is that the
Wolverines will be playing in the
toughest conference in hockey.
They would have to play perennial
Frozen Four contender Wisconsin,
a historical giant likely to regain its

stride in Minnesota and arch rival
Michigan State two to four times a
year depending on the schedule.
Don't count on Penn State being
a bottom feeder either. Northern
Michigan was in the national title
game four years after the team's
inception. And they didn't have
a guy who just sold his company
for four billion dollars pumping
money into the program, as Penn
State does.
While Michigan has a rosy
outlook of expansion and there
are plenty of pluses for the col-
lege hockey landscape (expanding
the blueprint, giving incentives
for other Big Ten teams to make
the jump, more exposure, more
money), CCHA teams should be
worried.
The Big Ten conference gives
the CCHA second-tier status.
By removing possibly the two
biggest draws of the conference
in Michigan and Michigan State,
it opens the door for other teams
to move. If there's one thing the
college football realignment has
taught us, it's that more change is
better.
Whether Notre Dame's foot-

ball team jumps to the Big Ten or
not, why not bring them into the
conference for hockey? The Irish
aren'tgoingto complain about
havingtheir new hockey facility
full when Michigan, Wisconsin
and Minnesota come to town at
least once a year.
And what stops the WCHA from
pulling Miami away, replacing
the RedHawks' road trips to Lake
Superior State and Western Michi-
gan with slugfests against North
Dakota and Denver?
Even if Michigan and Michigan
State games continue out of con-
ference, there isn't an incentive
for either Notre Dame or Miami
to stay in the CCHA. And if those
teams leave (and to a lesser extent
if they stay) the college hockey
world becomes stratified.
No program is in danger of
folding (except maybe pariah
Alabama-Huntsville). There is
too much tradition and too many
national titles among teams like
Lake Superior State and Bowling
Green for that to happen. But as
more teams come into Division-I
hockey (and right now that looks
extremely likely) and the talent

MAX COLLINS/Daily
Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson signed a three-year contract extension in
June to coach the Wolverines.

starts rolling toward programs
that have very deep pockets, the
smaller schools won't be able to
compete.
The only way to survive is by
sticking together on a lesser scale.
When Michigan takes on Lake
Superior State in 2015, it won't
exactly be the Hawks playing the

Mighty Ducks pre-Gordon Bom-
bay, but it will be close.
So, asa Michigan fan, rejoice,
but start writing your goodbye let-
ter to the CCHA now - before you
forget about it.

Gophers hope to
recover vs. USC

Vols look to rebound in rivalry

By JACOB KOFFSKY
For the Daily
* Week three of the 2010 college
football season may help fans deter-
mine whether the Gophers of Min-
nesota are actually "Golden" or not.
So far, they've been anything but,
coming off a tight three-point loss
to South Dakota. Yes, FCS South
TDakota.
After an offseason filled with high
expectations, Minnesota may need
to beat perennial powerhouse South-
ern Cal to fulfill them. But, you'd
best believe Lane Kiffin's Trojans
are going to play hard despite being
ineligible for bowl play. Sophomore
quarterback Matt Barkley has looked
sharp in their 2-0 start, having
thrown for seven touchdowns and
zero interceptions. He will look to
take advantage of a Golden Gopher
defense thatgave up 41points a week
ago.
Minnesota nation is hoping junior
running back Duane Bennett can
put up similar numbers on offense,
(18 car, 104 yds, 2 TDs) but there's
W a slight difference between South
Dakota and USC's defenses.
~Rating: 3out of5 footballs
NO.11 WISCONSIN VS.
ARIZONA STATE
You would think opposing defens-
es would be looking out for Wiscon-
sin junior running back John Clay,
yet the reigning Big Ten Offensive
Player of the Year continues to domi-
nate. Dating back to last season,
Clay has reached the century mark
in rushing and has scored at least a
touchdown in his past eight games.
In 2010, he has already ran for 260

yards and four touchdowns.
But the Sun Devils can light upthe
scoreboard as well. Former Michi-
gan quarterback Steven Threet has
helped the Arizona State offense to
score 95 points in its first two games.
The Badgers will remember Threet
as the quarterback who led an
18-point comeback win over them in
the Big House in 2008. He is comple-
mented by capable receiving threats,
Deantre Lewis and Mike Willie, who
both have caught touchdowns this
season.
This is the toughest test each
defense has faced so far, and all signs
point to a shootout. With both teams
undefeated, something's gotta give.

NO.9 IOWA AT
NO. 24 ARIZONA

By EVERETT COOK
For the Daily
The Florida-Tennessee game
doesn't carry as much weight as it
has in past years with the Volun-
teers still tryingto recover from the
departure of longtime coach Phillip
Fulmer and the brief tenure of Lane
Kiffin.
Still, the Vols are not a bad foot-
ball team, and this rivalry is too big
for either team to not show up. Flor-
ida found its new offensive speed-
ster in junior running back Jeffrey
Demps, who used his quickness to
run for 139 yards and a touchdown
against South Florida.
Demps, a NCAA champion
sprinter, will look to do the same
type of damage against the Vol-
unteers defense that Oregon
running back LaMichael James
did last week, running for 134
yards and a touchdown. But Ten-
nessee did a great job bottling
up James until the second half,
holding him to just 27 yards in
the first two quarters. If Tennes-
see can keep up its effort for four
quarters, it might be able to slow
down Demps enough to trot out
its' own offensive stud, junior
running back Tauren Poole.
Poole is averaging 6.8 yards
a carry and has rushed for 272
yards in the past two games. If
Tennessee can get Poole going
and slow down Demps, the Vol-
unteers will have a good chance
at beating the Gators for the first
time since 2004.

FCS team James Madison, Boise
State's win over the Hokies in week
one seems much less impressive
than it did at the time, giving mid-
major doubters more ammo.
But Boise State faces no cakewalk
opponent this week in a dangerous
Wyoming team. The Cowboys stuck
with Texas last week until late in the
second quarter, showing guts and
determination on the road after the
tragic loss of freshman linebacker
Ruben Narcisse, who was killed
just six days earlier in a car crash.
Wyoming has a multitude of offen-
sive weapons, but none bigger than
sophomore quarterback Austyn
Carta-Samuels. Carta-Samuels has
thrown for 479 yards with a 75-per-
cent completion rate in the first two

games, and also showed impres-
sive speed in running for a 18-yard
touchdown in the game against
Texas.
He has playmakers on the outside
in wide receivers Zach Bolger, David
Leonard and Mazi Ogbonna.Boise
State, not known for its defense, will
have it's hands full trying to contain
Carta-Samuels and the Wyoming
offense. Look for an exciting game
with no lack of offense.
Rating: 4 out of5 footballs
CLEMSON AT NO.16 AUBURN
Dark horse SEC contender
Auburn stayed on track with a win
against Mississippi State, although

the game was a lot closer than the
Tigers preferred. Auburn will play
a threatening offensive team this
week in Clemson, averaging 46.5
points per game.
Clemson will look to bring the
wood against Auburn, with junior
quarterback Kyle Parker and sopho-
more running back Andre Ellington
leading the charge.
Auburn counters with quarter-
back Cameron Newton leading a
running attack that produces 279
yards a game and a defense that does
not give up any easy points. Both of
these teams are flying under the
radar, and are both looking to show
the country what theyare all about.

CONCERT PREVIEW
Matt and Kim crash Detroit

FILM REVIEW
'Last Exorcism'
doesn't deliver

The pop duo brings
your favorite hits to The
Magic Stick
By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
"Being on tour with bronchitis is a little
tough," said vocalist and keyboard player
Matt Johnson, one-half
of the dance-rock duo M
Matt and Kim, in an
interview with the Daily. Kim
Though they've only
played one show, John- Tomorrow
son and the "Kim" of at 8 p.m.
Matt and Kim (drum- The Magic Stick
mer and vocalist Kim $15
Schifino) have had avery
successful tour so far.
After an announced swig of his
codeine-coated cough medicine, John-
son explained, "It was excellent, which is
bizarre for us because usually we play hor-
ribly on the first show on tour."
Johnson said that the band sometimes
has difficulty getting into a rhythm at the
start of a tour.
"Maybe we're just becoming profession-
als now and ... we can just do it," he humbly
joked.
The pair plans to play a show at The
Magic Stick in Detroit on Saturday, Sept.e18
at 8 p.m. They're on tour promoting their
upcoming album, Sidewalks, which debuts
Nov. 2. However, the duo doesn't plan to
play too many new tracks.

Matt and Kim made Pitchfork's top 100 tracks of 2009. Gangsta-roo did not.

Johnson clarified, "We have big plans
of playing just the one song, 'Cameras,' but
you know what? What I've realized, I've
gone to see bands, and like, you know, and
on stage, (they're) like 'who wants to hear
a new song?' and everyone's kind of like,
'Uhh Ijust wanna hear what I know!"'
But Johnson said this tour's lineup will
certainly not disappoint: "I mean, we have
songs on our old album that we've never
played and we tend to do things like little
interludes of kind of covers. We have a
bunch of new ones of those. So we're keep-
ing it fresh and still recognizable at the
same time."
Influenced by hip-hop and pop music,
Matt and Kim incorporate their fresh and
recognizable sound on their new album.

Though the album was more profession-
ally produced (2009's Grand was recorded
in Johnson's Vermont bedroom), they still
deliver the same endearingly poppy, com-
puterized Matt and Kim sound.
"We're big fans of pop music and hip-
hop and so songs like 'Good Old Fashion
Nightmare' and 'Daylight' had definite
influence, and so we've even gone even fur-
ther into that. Not that we don't have more
like fast, crash-y songs, andthings likethat,
but we went further into that with Side-
walks." Johnson continues, "It's just very
Matt and Kim."
If you can spare the gas money, be sure
to catch Matt and Kim in all their fast-
paced, cutesy glory tomorrow night at The
Magic Stick In Detroit.

seldom-spoken words.
What people who don't
talk much tend to do is - once they begin
saying something you think is really interest-
ing - just shrug, chuckle and say, "Oh, I don't
know," or "Forget it," and leave you disap-
pointed. You thought you were going to get a
small glimpse of insight out of a communica-
tive avenue you'd long believed was closed for
good, but, instead, you gotethe same old med-
ley of unoriginal mumbling.
"The Last Exorcism" feels like this shy
friend of yours, but it's a movie. It's an exor-
cism/demon flick, so don't expect much
meaning to come of it, but it begins with an
incredibly intriguing premise for what was
supposed tobe just another scary movie.
Genuine tension loses
to stale scare tactics.
It starts out detailingethe life of a preacher
who has fallen out of love with God and fakes
exorcisms for paying saps (or faithful cus-
tomers). His past and the way he grew up,
emulating his dad (who was also a preacher)
is a much more interesting plotline than what
the movie actually turns into: a rather stan-
dard horror film about a demon child.
The preacher's skepticism about the exis-
tence of demons (and God) in the firstplace is
really the only part of this movie that drives
the plot and our interest in his character. It's
paradoxical and intriguing when a preacher
loses his faith. That's a character working out
some demons of his own, which are worth
exploring. That's a character worth develop-
ing as a means of cluing us in to our own spiri-
tual doubts. Maybe the resolution of who this
man is could end up standing as an allegory

for how some say we've lost touch with God
as a society.
But no. Once "The Last Exorcism" raises
its hand and starts saying something unex-
pectedly cool it gets a little deeper into its
story and then basically throws up its hands,
saying, "Oh, I don't know," and we then pro-
ceed with 45 more minutes of "Blair Witch"-
style demon movie.
Once the film abandons its fascinating
opening, it essentially turns into a run-of-the-
mill, "Don't go in there!" horror flick. Instead
of the director and writers creatively winking
at you, they justhad something intheir eyes.
While it will make audiences shriek and
cover their faces - as any scary movie should
- it won't make you use much of your brain,
which is sad, because it almost feels like the
filmmakers give up on the plot at the same
time you do.
This resignation of the duties of storytell-
ing actually has parallels within the movie,
shot as a faux-documentary with a handheld
camera. At one point the documentarian's
camera is snatched up by the demon-pos-
sessed girl herself, and we see a segment of
the film from her perspective. While innova-
tive, and more chilling than any other partof
the movie, the demon taking the camera ulti-
mately sums up the way you'll feel once the
final credits roll, and you leave the theater.
It's like they had a really good idea for a
movie no one had ever seen before, but half-
way through some demon possessed them to
let their desire for spooks and ominous fore-

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan has been down both
paths before. On Saturday either the
expected or the unthinkable could
happen. The Wolverines host Massa-
chusetts - an Football Championship
Subdivision opponent - on Saturday
and Michigan fans
have seen firsthand UMs at
what the underdog
can accomplish in Michigan
the Big House. Matchup:
Two years ago it UMass 2-0;
was Toledo - a non- Michigan 2-0
power conference When: Sat-
Division-I school - urday, Noon
who beat the Wol- Where: Michi-
verines. In Lloyd gan Stadium
Carr's last season
it was Appalachian T/Radio:
State, the cream Network
of the crop of FCS
competition.
Sure, the Wolverines handled
Delaware State in 2009, but the FCS
threat is building all around the
country.
James Madison knocked off then-
No. 13 Virginia Tech just a week ago.
Five Division I teams have already
lost to FCS schools. It wasn't just
Akron and Ball State that fell victim
to the trap. Minnesota lost to South
Dakota, 41-38, and North Dakota
State topped Kansas, 6-3.
"There's players everywhere,"
Rodriguez said on Monday. "It's not
like you're playing 18 -and-19 year-
old kids against 14-year-olds. We
are playing, it's the same kids, same
age, and in some respects, it's differ-

ent. And the difference is, in the FCS
level, the good teams, the Top 25,
30 teams, are really, really good and
really competitive."
Massachusetts could pose a prob-
lem for Michigan if the Wolverines
are quick to dismiss the Minutemen
as a real threat. Massachusetts is in
the top 20 in both of the FCS polls
and upset a then-No. 4 William &
Mary team to start the season.
At key playmaking positions, the
Minutemen could pose problems for
the Wolverine defense. Massachu-
setts averaged more than 220 yards
rushing during the first two games of
the season, and senior wide receiver
Anthony Nelson has 13 catches for
181 yards and a touchdown already.
The Minutemen have players who
can make Michigan pay for its mis-
takes, but Rodriguez said that he
liked his team's attitude during prac-
tice this week.
"(At Tuesday's) practice, the focus
was really good and they seem to be
into it," Rodriguez said. "We've talk-
ed about since August camp started
of having unshakeable focus. And I
reminded them of that again yester-
day. I was pleased with that and their
attention to detail."
That attention to detail might not
have been at the forefront after the
Wolverines' dramatic win over Notre
Dame. Michigan overcame eight pen-
alties for 99 yards against the Fight-
ing Irish after the Wolverines had a
pretty clean opening week against
Connecticut. Even though Michigan
hasn't turned the ball over in the first
two weeks, Rodriguez knows his
team can't afford to shoot itself in the

MAX COLLINS/Daily

Sophomore Denard Robinson amassed 502 total yards last week in Michigan's 28-24 win over Notre Dame.

foot.
"We are still not good enough to
play poorly and win," Rodriguez said.
"We are not deep enough yet. We are
not experienced enough yet, and I
don't want to test that out."
Speculation has already started
around how long sophomore quar-
terback Denard Robinson will even
see the field against Massachusetts.
Sophomore quarterback Tate Forci-
er, who started every game last year,
played just one drive against Dela-
ware St. But he was recovering from
a concussion suffered the previous
week.

Michigan won that game 63-6 and
set a team record with 727 total yards
in the win. Robinson completed
three-of-four passes for 85 yards and
two touchdowns on the day in relief
of Forcier.
When questioned about Robin-
son's role on Saturday, Rodriguez
maintained that the coaches will do
whatever it takes to win the game.
The quarterback has made an
impact in his first career starts, but
experience is invaluable. The reps
Robinson takes against the Minute-
men could pay dividends down the
road for the Wolverines.

"(It's) the same we expect out of
him every day in practice," Rodri-
guez said. "To continue to progress
as far as the knowledge of what we
want to do as far as our concepts
are concerned. How we're going to
attack a particular defense. UMass
will provide different challenges for
what they do with their defense and
their coverages. So he'll have to be
sharp.
"Every game is like a test for him,
both mentally and physically. He's
passed those tests for the most part,
but there's still things we've got to
get better at."

from newfound superstar Denard Robinson. And despite the sim-

across the street.
Virginia Tech and Minnesota have been vic-

2010 Schedule

Connecticut (Sept. 4): Denard ran all over
UConn. He proved he could pass the ball too.
Notre Dame (Sept. 11): After UConn, the ND
game was Denard's encore on steroids, with a
game-winning drive:
Massachusetts (Sept.18): Michigan is feeling
good coming home with a 2-0 record. The Wol-
verines feel like kicking some UMass.
Bowling Green (Sept. 25): Bowling Green has
to replace a potent passing attack. Somewhere,
Greg Robinson breathes a sigh of relief.
Indiana (Oct. 2): If Michigan wins a close one
done the stretch again, we fully expect Bill Lynch
to top last year's gum-throwing sideline stunt.
Michigan State (Oct. 9): This could be the Wol-
verines' first big test of the season. Michigan
could easily be 5-0 entering this in-state rivalry.

Iowa (Oct. 16): Iowa's Adrian Clayborn may be
the Big Ten's closest replacement for BG. That's
a problem only if he can catch Shoelace.
Penn State (Oct. 30): PSU has a freshman QB.
Michigan knows what that's like. 'Nuff said.
Illinois (Nov. 6): Ron Zook is probably the only
IL IS coach in the nation who makes RichRod feel like
his job isnsecure.
Purdue (Nov. 13): Danny Hope did something
last season RichRod would kill for: beat OSU.
Now, they actually have a quarterback.
Wisconsin (Nov. 20): The Badgers basically
return their entire team. But hey, their last visit
to the Big House went pretty well for Michigan.
Ohio State (Nov. 27): Who knows, maybe
Terrelle Pryor and OSU will have to try and derail
Michigan's title hopes. Hey, we can dream right?

a behemoth. He's the only one out of
the three who actually looks like he
plays football. But Will is right-his
personality is bigger than life. Had he
not injured himself in the spring, he
would be getting significant playing
time at defensive end, where he spelled
Brandon Graham last year and played
all 12 games. And he'd-be a media dar-
ling, Will is smart, thoughtful and likes
to talk about almost anything, espe-
cially Michigan football.
"I watched every game growingup,"
Will says. "I can still remember a lot
of games - well, almost every game,
probably."
Will, of the three subjects of this
story, was the pioneer. A prodigious
baseball talent in high school, Will
played football for fun and to spend
time with his teammates, who includ-
ed Pat and Russ. Growing up, baseball
was his focus. But his passion was
Michigan football.
"Michigan football was everything
to me growing up," Will says. "We'd
play there (Holloway Field) Friday
nights and couldn't wait for Saturday
morning when you'd get up and watch
the game or go down to the Stadium.
You'd look across the street sometimes
during warm-ups and just dream, but
actually playing there wasn't realistic."
After Will's senior football season,
Noah Hurwitz, the guardian of one of
Will's teammates at Pioneer, Cameron
Joplin (who now plays tight end for
Northwestern), told Will he could play
football in college and that he'd make
him a highlight video. Will was doubt-
ful, but Hurwitz persisted.
"He said, 'You're big, you're fast,
you could walk on - a lot of schools
would love to have you.' So he made a
highlight tape and sent it to Wisconsin,
Northwestern and Michigan."
Will went to Schembechler Hall to
drop his tape off - "The coolest thing
I had ever done." - and the director of
football operations told him he'd hear
back in a week.
"So I was like, 'Well, that's the last
time I'll see them:"
But of course it wasn't. Will called
the team after not hearing anything for
a week and they were surprised no one
had contacted him before. They told
him they would love to have him on the

Breakdown: Despite trend of FCS wins,
Michigan should run over Massachusetts

team, and to report for camp in August.
Will dropped the phone. He had
a decision to make: play baseball for
Michigan, the sport he'd committed
the better half of his life to and clearly
his better sport, or take his chances
playing for a team he had worshipped
as a kid, and still did.
In the end, his love for Michigan
football and the chance to play in the
Big House, practice with Chad Henne
and Mike Hart and Mario Manning-
ham and go up against Jake Long on
the line, won out.
"It turned out to be probably the
best choice Iever made," Will says.
And so the fan, the kid who couldn't
wait to get to Michigan Stadium on
Saturday afternoons, became the play-
er. He wasn't alone.
"I remember working at Russ's try-
out," Linkner says. "I was literally the
person shooting jugs to him and seeing
himworkout. It's justfunnyto seeyour
high school and middle school class-
mate show up and make the team."
In Ann Arbor, the name Furrha is
synonymous with football. It seems
like every year, there's a new batch of
Furrha football standouts ready to step
in. In fact, there used tobe two Furrhas
on Michigan's roster - Russ's younger
cousin Nader was a quarterback on the
team until he transferred this year to a
junior college. Russ has three cousins
currently playing college football: Fadi
plays for Toledo, Odeh plays for Indi-
ana State and Esham plays for Saginaw
Valley State.
Making Michigan's team as a walk-
on was the end of a long road for Russ.
But he stresses that for him, playing
football at Michigan is only one of

at Pioneer High School.
two major life goals. Being a student
at Michigan was at least as important.
But make no mistake: Russ's goal is to
see the field, maybe on special teams.
"Some, like my uncle and stuff, are
like, 'Great, you're on the team. So,
what's next?' " Russ says. "You should
always be progressing and not be nos-
talgic. You've got to create more goals
for yourself."
But his family, however football-
intensive it may be, always stresses
that school comes first.
"Their expectations are school
first," Russ says. "But they'd definitely
love to see me on the field and I'd love
to see myself on the field."
"Besides goingto Michigan State my
freshman year, I went to Allen Elemen-
tary, which is off Stadium (Boulevard),
I went to middle school at Tappan,
which is off Stadium and then Pioneer
which is off Stadium," Pat says. "So
outside of that one year at State, I not
only lived in Ann Arbor but lived right
in the shadow of Michigan Stadium."
AsPatexplains it,thetwochoices for
him out of high school were to either
play at one of the numerous smaller
schools that were giving him attention
or go to Michigan State, where some of
his best friends were going and where
he would havea realistic shot at study-
ing business. So Pat went to State. But
he didn't ever, he wants to stress, go
green.
"At no point was I ever a Michigan
State fan for anything," Pat says. "My
dorm room, I had two big Michigan
flags. The thing that sucks is we went
around our dorm freshman year and
introduced ourselves, and when I said
I was from Ann Arbor, people wanted
to know if I was a State fan now, and
I said, 'No, I'm a Michigan fan and I
always will be."
Although the truth, it wasn't the
smartest thing to say. A major upset
in the Big House that first weekend of
Pat's freshman year made that Satur-
day... challenging.
"t just heard a stampede coming
down the hallway so I closed my door
and locked it."

While Pat was stranded in the land
of the Spartans, he kept in touch with
Will, who was back in Ann Arbor
redshirting for the Wolverines. Will
told him about some of the other play-
ers walking on at Michigan, how a
lot of them were guys the two had
played against in high school, guys Pat
thought he measured up well against.
Pat had stayed in great shape while at
Michigan State, and he felt like he was
the strongest he'd ever been. Finally,
Will suggested to Pat that he should
transfer and try out for the team.
"I talked to the director of football
operations and said my friend is a real-
ly good athlete and will do what's right
for the team and he's a smart kid," Will
says. "And he said, 'Well, let's bring
him down for a tryout."'
"Will was like, 'You should try to
come, you should try to come,"' Pat
says. "And I was like, dude, I would
give anything to do that but it's not
realistic."
Pat spent the first semester of his
sophomore year in East Lansing, with
Will in his ear the whole time. Finally,
in October of his sophomore year, Pat
handed in his applicationtogo to Mich-
igan. He was so sure he wouldn'tcget in,
let alone play on the football team, that
he didn't tell a soul he applied.
Over winter break of his sopho-
more year, Pat got an e-mail that said
he'd been accepted to Michigan. He
ordered a U-Haul truck to retrieve all
of his belongings from Michigan State
and dropped all of his classes.
"It literally happened, like, over-
night," Pat says.
He tried out that winter for the team,
at the same tryout as redshirt sopho-
more safety Jordan Kovacs, and made
it in time for spring ball that same year.
"I feel like I haven't realized what's
happened yet," Pat says. I feel like I

don't have time to sit down and think
about it. But I'm afraid if I do that I'll
get complacent, which is what I'm
most afraid of"
With Pat back where he belongs,
the three kids who grew up going to
the Big House every Saturday still do-
except now, instead of watching the
winged helmets, they wear them.
Back at Linkner's apartment, Will
describes the Michigan football team's
connection to Ann Arbor like this:
"People definitely live through the
team. Regardless of what kind of peo-
ple they are, religiously, demographi-
cally, almost everyone cares about the
football team. And Ann Arbor's a dif-
ferent city; there are a lot of different
people living here. But everyone seems
to tune in and at least care about how
the team is doing. It's kind of this con-
nection that brings everyone together.
Growing up, I was in the shadow of
it, it was more important than almost
anything. It really instills a love for the
team in you, and I think that's helped
me a lot where I'm at now."
It's nearly impossible to grow up in
Ann Arbor and ignore Michigan foot-
ball. It's an atmosphere. It worms its
way into nearly every facet of autumn
life - conversations, traffic, local
news, everything. It hovers over every-
thing just as the Big House hovers over
Holloway Field.
There's something desperate about
the hold young Ann Arborites have on
the football team. For them, there is
something so thrilling about rooting
for a team that is all theirs, for a team
so important, for a team so delightfully
national that remains all their own.
Russ Furrha, Pat Collins and Will
Heininger were all once those boys.
Now, they're Wolverines.

It's almost dusk at Holloway Field, the site of Pioneer High School's
football games every Thursday and Friday. Russ Furrha is checking his
reflection in the car window before walking to the field, the site of many
of Russ's own athletic exploits now nearly four years past. He needs to
make sure his faux-hawk is perfectly quaffed. He's at a photo shoot, after
all, and must be ready for his close-up.

"I don't think I've been here in four years," Russ
remarks to no one in particular.
Pat Collins and Will Heininger, two of Russ's for-
mer teammates at Pioneer and current teammates
on the Michigan football team, meet us at the field.
They find a small openingin the right wingofthe gate
surrounding the stands, and the three walk through
the tunnel under the bleachers that leads to the field.
There's a new sign above the tunnel's exit. It's a quote
from John Wooden:
Success travels in the company of very hard work.
There is no trick, no easy way.
"That quote's stupid," Pat says.
Will looks at him, slightly surprised. "Come on,
that's a great quote. You just don't like it because it's
new."
The trio shuffles under the sign and onto the field.
Alex Linkner, a student manager for the football team

and a fellow Pioneer grad, throws Pat a football he
swiped from Schembechler Hall after practice. The
guys toss it around against the backdrop of the set-
ting sun.
You can see the skyline of downtown Ann Arbor
quite clearly from the top row of the stands of the
Holloway Field. But the most dominant form on the
landscape is Michigan Stadium, just across Stadium
Boulevard. The Big House. The colossal stadium
functions as a physical manifestation of the omni-
present entity that is Michigan football inAnn Arbor.
Without a doubt it is the city's most recognizable
landmark - at times it seems almost too big for Ann
Arbor, whose entire population amounts to less than
the Stadium's capacity.
The three Michigan football players tossing the
football around at Holloway field were once small
boys who idolized Tom Brady, Anthony Thomas and

Charles Woodson. They went to every home game.
They were fans, just like so many young boys grow-
ingup in Ann Arbor.
The trio offers a unique glimpse into the con-
nection between Ann Arbor the town and the Uni-
versity Michigan football team. Looking across the
street from Holloway Field to Michigan Stadium, as
these three have countless times, makes the distance
between the two seem small. But in reality, there is
still a vast gap.
Will, Pat and Russ bridged the gap.
With South Park on in the background, the con-
versation at Linkner's Ann Arbor apartment turns to
high school. Specifically, to Will in high school.
"Will, his nickname in our group of friends has
always been 'Giant,' " Linker says, sitting beside me
on his couch. Will is sitting in a chair to the right of
us. "He's always been a very large human being. In
high school, you never imagined he'd be able to get
that much bigger..."
Will interrupts absent-mindedly. He's engrossed
in peeling a banana. "Come on, it's because of my per-
sonality, too."
Linkner continues without a pause. "...But he gets
here and you look at pictures from back then, and he
looks like a small giant," Linkner says. "Now, he's just
a huge, huge giant."
It's true. At 6-foot-6 and almost 270 pounds, Will is
