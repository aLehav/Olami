A large crowd gathered in 

downtown Ann Arbor Saturday 
afternoon for a student-led “die-
in,” standing in solidarity with 
the victims of the massacre 
that occured in Parkland, Fla., 
at Majory Stoneman Douglas 
High School, as well as the 33 
additional children killed as a 
result of gun violence since the 
shooting. 

The crowd, diverse in age 

and background — ranging 
from high school students 
to elected officials — took 
over Liberty Plaza, raising 
signs with phrases such as 
“Law Makers work for us, not 
the NRA!,” “I should not be 
afraid to go to school,” and 
“#NeverAgain.”

Participants laid on the 

concrete 
for 
six 
minutes, 

approximately the amount of 
time the shooter was active at 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas, 
while the names of the victims 
and the additional 33 children 
were read aloud. Once the 
names had been read, stillness 
and silence overtook the park.

The 
demonstration 
was 

organized 
by 
Washtenaw 

Youth Initiative, a student-run 
organization 
encompassing 

students of the Ann Arbor, 
Saline 
and 
Dexter 
school 

districts. 

After the die-in, additional 

students and speakers gave 
individual statements to the 

crowd.

Students stood up on the 

raised 
concrete 
platform 

to deliver monologues and 
personal testimonies on how 
they believed gun laws must 
be reformed in the United 
States. 
Marquan 
Kane, 
a 

senior at Pioneer High School, 
addressed the crowd in a bright 
orange jumpsuit, meant to 
portray the importance of gun 
reform and bring to light the 

issue of mass incarceration.

“We 
don’t 
have 
a 
gun 

problem in America, we’ve got 
several,” Kane said. “If you take 
the issues of mass shootings, 
suicides and gang violence, 
which are all exasperated due 
to easy access to these guns, 
you’ve got a huge problem.”

Kane explained why this 

issue is personal to him.

“I have lost two cousins to 

gun violence, and I’ve lost one 

of my friends who was shot in 
my neighborhood,” he said. 
“This issue is very personal 
to me, and not to mention the 
fact that I have been held at 
gunpoint in my lifetime. So, 
I know all too well about the 
trauma that guns bring to our 
lives.”

It has been almost six years 

since Engineering senior Javier 
Contreras 
received 
a 
phone 

call from his father telling him 
President Barack Obama had 
signed a sweeping executive 
order that would allow Contreras 
to apply for a two-year renewable 
protection from deportation.

Since the 2012 enactment of 

the Obama-era policy formally 
known as Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals, Contreras 
and approximately 800,000 non-
citizen students and graduates 
under the age of 30 have received 
temporary lawful status to live, 
work and study in the United 
States. These students represent 
a spectrum of backgrounds and 
identities, yet they share the 
experience of having entered 
the United States as minors 
without 
legal 
documentation 

or have overstayed their visas. 
For a period, these students, 
coined “Dreamers”, cautiously 
enjoyed the protections afforded 
to them by DACA, but Contreras 
was always wary of the fragile 
political architecture that upheld

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

NEW YORK CITY, NY — 

Moritz Wagner stood with his 
arms in the air, facing the crowd 
behind the Michigan bench as the 
clock ran down.

John 
Beilein 
walked 
over 

smiling. The two embraced as the 
rest of the Wolverines mobbed 
them.

The 
buzzer 
sounded, 
and 

the team spilled onto the court, 
showered with streamers and 
the tune of “The Victors” coming 
from the pep band.

For the second season in a row, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team (13-5 Big Ten, 28-7 overall) 
is champion of the Big Ten 
Tournament, beating Purdue (15-
3, 28-6), 75-66.

“It’s a surreal feeling, because 

you always envision it,” said 
senior 
guard 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman. 
“But 
when 

you’re actually out there playing, 
you forget about everything you 
envisioned. And once you hear 
that buzzer sound, it all starts to 
sink in.”

The fate of the game started 

to become clear midway through 
the second half.

The Wolverines opened up a 

16-point lead the same way they’d 
had 
success 
throughout 
the 

Tournament. Sophomore guard 
Zavier Simpson was attacking the 
basket and finding open shooters, 
his teammates were knocking 
down 
shots 
and 
Michigan’s 

defense was stifling Purdue.

All the Wolverines needed was 

a dagger.

With just over six minutes to 

play they got one courtesy of an 
unexpected breakout player.

Waiting for a screen from 

backup center Jon Teske, Simpson 
held the ball at the top of the key.

Simpson drove right, slashing 

into the lane and drawing a double 
team. He dished it off to Teske. 
The sophomore rose up and 
slammed it over all-conference 
center Isaac Haas, drawing a foul 
in the process.

Madison 
Square 
Garden 

exploded as Teske, who finished 
with 14 points, hung on the rim for 
an extra beat before flexing and 
celebrating with his teammates. 
It was the electric play Michigan 
was looking for, and it came from 
perhaps the least animated player 
on the team.

“I don’t remember what was 

going through my head, just all 
of that emotion kind of spilled 
out,” Teske said. “It really gets 
the team going, I mean, being 
able to finish over a big-body guy 
like that, I really have no words to 
explain for it.”

The Wolverines started the 

game like they were still riding 

the high of their semifinal win 
over Michigan State.

Michigan played the first half 

about as well as it could have, 
shooting 53 percent from the field 
without turning the ball over 
once. The Wolverines did miss 
some open threes that would 
have extended their lead, but they 
still held on to a 38-33 advantage 
heading into the locker room.

Then they went on their run.
With just over 12 minutes 

left in the game, and Michigan 
threatening to pull away for good, 
fifth-year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson stood on the baseline. 
He was preparing to inbound 
the ball with three seconds left 
on the shot clock and his team 
maintaining an 11-point lead.

He tossed it in to Wagner, who 

took one step toward the corner, 
spun around and heaved a fall-
away 3-pointer. It found nothing 
but the bottom of the net.

“To be honest with you I didn’t 

know how much time was on the 
clock,” Wagner said. “I just saw 
Duncan running for the hand-off. 
It must have been a little time on 
the clock, so I took my time and 
shot it and it went in.”

From there, Michigan hit its 

shots, it played its defense, it hit 
enough free throws — barely — to 
win and it celebrated under the 
rest of the confetti, which came 
out on time as the clock ran out.

It was announced after the 

game that Wagner, who scored 
17 points in 17 minutes, was the 
tournament’s Most Outstanding 
Player.

On stage with his team at the 

trophy celebration, he said he 
couldn’t stop smiling. It makes 
sense, because Wagner’s come a 
long way to get to this point, both 
literally and figuratively.

But Beilein’s presence has 

made it easier on him. He’s 

become a player worthy of high 
praise under Beilein, and when 
they hugged before the clock 
hit zeroes, he told Beilein how 
grateful he was.

“It’s amazing, because he’s 

on me every day, you know?” 
Wagner said after the game. 
“And that’s what he’s supposed to 
do. He has so much belief in me 
and all of us as a player. He never 
gives up on anybody, and I very 
much appreciate that. If I have 
a bad day, he comes up to me, 
and it’s just something I really 
appreciate, and I let him know 
that.”

There will be more basketball 

for the Wolverines, and they’ll 
find out when and where next 
Sunday.

But there’s a celebration to be 

had first. There’s another trophy 
to hoist. For the second season in 
a row, Michigan is the class of the 
Big Ten.

According to reports Thursday, 

University 
of 
Michigan 
LSA 

freshman Jacob Moore is the first 
male victim to file suit against 
former USA Gymnastics and 
Michigan State University doctor 
Larry Nassar.

This complaint is one of six 

amended complaints filed as part 
of the civil suit against Nassar, 
USAG, and MSU. Over 250 women 
and young girls have now sued 
Nassar and the organizations he 
worked within.

This 
week 
Olympic 
gold 

medalist Aly Raisman filed suit in 
California against USAG, stating 
she can not wait any longer for the 
organization to do what is right.

Moore is a current member of 

the University’s men’s gymnastics 
team and a former member of the 
U.S. men’s junior national team. 
He saw Nassar at 16 years old, 
seeking treatment for shoulder 
pain. The alleged abuse took 
place in Nassar’s basement in 
April 2016, after Nassar had been 
fired by USAG but while he as still

the policy.

“These policies come with 

a lot of background risks and 
threats to our community that 
a lot of people, unless you are 
undocumented, 
don’t 
know,” 

Contreras said.

Obama’s use of unilateral 

powers to enact DACA was a 
decision rooted in Congress’ 
failure 
to 
reach 
a 
solution 

addressing 
issues 
faced 
by 

undocumented immigrants.

A 
legislative 
measure 
to 

provide a pathway to citizenship 
for undocumented immigrants 
brought to the U.S. as children 
— known as the Dream Act — 
was first proposed to Congress 
in 2001. Since then, the Dream 
Act has cyclically been brought 
back into the spotlight, including 
in 
2012 
when 
the 
Obama 

administration 
announced 

it 
would 
stop 
deporting 

undocumented 
immigrants 

who fit certain criteria. When 
President 
Donald 
Trump 

entered the Oval Office in 2017, 
his wavering position on DACA 
heralded an uncertain future for 
DACA recipients. In September 
2017, Trump announced the 
rescission of DACA would begin 
on March 5, 2018. The timing of 
the announcement purposefully 

allowed for a six-month window 
in order to spur congressional 
action in addressing the issue.

As congressional leadership 

has spent the month of February 
engaging in closed door debate 
over DACA, lower courts in 
New York and California have 
issued injunctions requiring the 
continuation of DACA permit 
renewals. On Feb. 26, the U.S. 
Supreme Court added another 
layer of uncertainty to the status 
of DACA recipients, refusing to 
hear Trump’s bid that DACA is 
unconstitutional and upholding 
the prior injunctions.

Charles Shipan, University of 

Michigan professor of political 
science, predicted the Supreme 
Court would be hesitant to 
weigh in on the DACA program 
because of the court’s wariness 
toward political issues. Shipan 
cited the saturated congressional 
dialogue regarding immigration 
as a reason for why the Supreme 
Court would view DACA as 
a political issue rather than a 
question of legality. The Supreme 
Court’s deferral of the DACA case 
to the lower courts means DACA 
will stay in place at least until the 
U.S. Court of Appeals hears it; 
however, this process could take 
months.

Shipan 
believes 
legislative 

inaction 
on 
DACA 
reflects 

the hallmarks of the current 
congressional 
climate: 

Polarization, internal Republican 
party divisions and presidential 

pressure. Yet, Shipan suggested 
the emphasis on the polarization 
narrative sometimes overlooks 
other contributing factors of the 
DACA policy stalemate.

“There is a fair amount of 

agreement between a lot of 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, 

which would be to provide a path 
of citizenship for the Dreamers 
and increase funding for border 
security,” Shipan said. “If that 
would be put to a vote right now 
in both chambers it would win 
because we would get a number 
of Democrats and a number of 
Republicans to agree to that. 
The polarization is a problem, 
but I actually think that gets 
overstated as a problem in this 
issue.”

Yet as the three government 

branches 
wrestle 
over 
the 

future of DACA, for many DACA 
recipients, including Contreras, 
the 
turmoil 
of 
the 
Trump 

administration weighs heavier 
than the March 5 deadline.

“Generally, if I am going to be 

honest, I am kind of burnt out 
or numb to the fact that DACA 
or the Dream Act isn’t going to 
be a reality in the next year,” 
Contreras said. “Just because 
first it was December, then it was 
February, now it is March 5 and 
nothing is going to happen on 
March 5. It is constant, I hate to 
be so pessimistic and negative, 
but it is just the trend that has 
been following.”

The uncertainty that shadows 
DACA has led institutions 
like the University to evaluate 
their own commitment to 
undocumented 
student 

populations. The University 
does not keep an official 
record of the number of 
undocumented 
students 

and 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel has pledged 
to protect the identity and 
information of unauthorized 
immigrant students.

On March 2, following the 

Supreme Court’s decision not 
to hear the case, Schlissel 
released 
a 
statement 

reaffirming the University’s 
support. Schlissel highlighted 
the 
University 
actions 

including 
collaborating 

with 
other 
institutions, 

hiring Hector Galvan within 
the 
Office 
of 
Academic 

Multicultural Initiatives to 
assist undocumented students 
who 
seek 
support 
and 

publishing DACA resources 
and contacts online.

Kristin 
Bhaumik, 
the 

associate director of the Office 
of Financial Aid, emphasized 
the University’s commitment 

to the financial resources of 
all 
undergraduate 
students, 

including DACA recipients.

“DACA is a subcategory of 

the students who are eligible,” 
Bhaumik said. “We have never 
made that eligibility contingent 
on DACA. The pending rescission 
impacts so many things in 
their lives and is something I 
personally worry about for many 
of the students that I know, but 
the funding that this University 
is providing is not contingent on 
that status at the undergraduate 
level.”

Contreras was part of the fight 

for tuition parity as a member of 
the Coalition for Tuition Equality 
in 2011. Prior to the 2013 update 
of 
the 
residency 
pathways, 

undocumented students were 
unable to qualify for in-state 
tuition.

However, DACA recipients 

are ineligible for Federal Student 
Aid, 
which 
includes 
federal 

loans, grants and work study. In 
light of this, the University has 
worked with DACA recipients to 
find alternative funding avenues.

“It wasn’t the same time that 

residency 
was 
updated, 
but 

about a year or two afterwards, 
Provost 
Pollack 
authorized 

some unrestricted scholarship 
funding to assist undocumented 
and DACA-mented students with 
need-based resources,” Bhaumik 
said.

Contreras 
is 
grateful 
for 

the financial aid that has been 
provided to him through these 
allocated funds.

“Every year (the regents) vote 

on it to decide how much funding 
there will be and if there will be 
any funding at all. So far, we have 
gotten lucky; ever since 2013 they 
have been continuously voting to 
fund it,” Contreras said.

Bhaumik explained how the 

University’s financial aid policies 
are constantly being evaluated to 
ensure the University is acting 
in accordance with state and 
federal law.

“Right now, we think we are 

still operating in a way that is 
both legal, defensible and in the 
best interest of our Michigan 
residents, but that is constantly 
being evaluated,” Bhaumik said.

While DACA continues to be 

at the forefront of media and 
political dialogue, for Contreras 
— a student activist since high 
school — the constant state 
of 
uncertainty 
has 
proven 

exhausting.

Business, Engineering and LSA 

students from the University of 
Michigan collaborated to form 
Upstart, a team that recently 
won the Social Impact Challenge, 
a contest held by the Center of 
Social Impact. Now, the students 
are talking with the Detroit 
Economic Growth Corporation 
to implement their plan and to 
provide a boost to Detroit’s retail 
industry.

The DEGC is an organization 

that aims to help entrepreneurs 
establish short term pop-ups. 
According to a press release, 

members of the DEGC say they 
hope to utilize the teams’ ideas.

According to the Detroit Free 

Press, Detroit’s economy has 
improved over the last several 
years, but the city still struggles to 
maintain retail stores. The Social 
Impact Challenge gives graduate 
and undergraduate students the 
opportunity to work together to 
develop solutions to real life social 
issues, such as Detroit’s retail 
industry.

Upstart is encouraging the 

DEGC to acquire longer term 
leases with building landlords 

so that pop-ups will be attracted 
by shorter term leases. The 
team also proposed including 
renovation grants and training for 
entrepreneurs.

Upstart member Brie Riley, a 

Business junior, said the group’s 
goal was not just to create a 
pop-up, but to help sustainable 
business.

“We 
hope 
we’ll 
get 
the 

opportunity to work with DEGC 
and see these ideas implemented,” 
Riley said in the press release.“We 
don’t want to just create a pop-
up. We want to create long-term 

sustainable shops.”

Kyla Carlsen, DEGC small 

business financial manager, said 
the organization is looking into 
ways to incorporate the winning 
students’ ideas to promote Detroit 
business and to add sustainability 
to stores.

“We saw a need for this interim 

opportunity for entrepreneurs to 
try out their product, to set them 
up for long-term success and lower 
the barriers for people to locate in 
our neighborhoods,” Carlsen said 
the release.

ON THE DAILY: STUDENTS RE-PLAN POP-UPS

DACA
From Page 1A


As a fourth grader, my afternoon 

routine was simple. After getting 
off the bus, I’d make myself some 
microwavable macaroni & cheese 
and settle in with a copy of The 
Detroit Free Press. I’d usually start 
with the sports section (no one 
knew the Pistons like I did) before 
moving on to the news section, 
film reviews and, finally, the 
comics. The day the Freep stopped 

delivering to my household was 
a dark one and I unconvincingly 
pleaded with my parents to pay 
for the new, much more expensive 
special delivery fee.

My love of the news didn’t 

stop as I grew older (even if daily 
newspaper deliveries did). In high 
school, I joined my school paper 
and fell in love with being on the 
other side of the business. While 
the readership was small, I relished 
the power of a platform and its 
ability to shape conversation. This 
led me to join The Michigan Daily 
where I found my way to Michigan 

in Color — the section of The Daily 
dedicated to uplifting voices of 
color.

However, as a member of MiC, 

my rosy view of the journalism 
industry began to dim. MiC was 
founded because The Daily lacked 
the voices of students of color, which 
led to the mischaracterization 
and oftentimes racist depictions 
of students of color. The founders 
of MiC felt they couldn’t trust 
journalists to properly convey the 
real experiences of people of color, 
so they created a section where we 
would write for ourselves.

Fast forward to a week ago. 

Since I first heard about the 
Newseum, I’ve been intrigued. The 
museum is intended as a testament 
to the First Amendment — freedom 
of the press, speech, religion and 
petition — and its importance to 
a thriving society. From my first 
steps into the building, I felt the 
weight and responsibility the 
press puts on itself. Famous quotes 
about the importance of the First 
Amendment, and the press in 
particular, covered the walls while 
exhibits contained information 
and old news clips explaining the 
role of the press in the Civil Rights 
Movement, the Vietnam War 
and uncovering injustice around 
the world. Highlights included 
a timeline of front pages of 
newspapers from pivotal points in 
history and the sobering memorial 
to journalists murdered for their 
work in pursuing justice.

The Newseum is a glorification 

of the press. In these hallowed 
halls, the press is always on the 
right side of history — always 
there to stand up for the rights of 
the oppressed, always objective, 
always the hero. However, I take 
issue with this the lack of nuance, 
and honestly, the reality of the 
building. The Newseum ignored 
one of the tenets of good journalism: 
Always tell the whole story. For 
all the headlines the Newseum 
showcased that exalted the Civil 
Rights Movement, they missed 

the ones decrying its protesters 
as “troublemakers” or “rioters.” 
The Newseum can cherry-pick 
the front pages for the ones that 
portray the press 
in a good light, but 
it doesn’t erase 
the harmful work 
that has occurred 
and continues to 
this day.

For its faults, 

I cannot entirely 
dislike 
the 

Newseum 
or 

the 
industry 

and values it so 
lovingly portrays. 
The press is a 
vital 
institution 

for a fair society 
and 
historically 

it has been a part 
of social change 
and 
progress. 

However, 
for 

all 
its 
virtues, 

members of the 
media must come 
to 
terms 
with 

the harm those 
same actions can 
cause. For all the 
Watergates 
and 

Pentagon Papers 
journalism unveils, it does not 
mitigate that the news industry 
was the main driver of associating 
Islam with terrorism.

As the “first rough draft of 

history,” the news often shapes 
what and how people think. When 
the only stories of people of color 
are negative, how will society 

react? When Black 
people who march 
are rioters but white 
people who march 
are protesters, what 
will society think? 
I want to be clear, 
this isn’t a critique 
of 
the 
Breitbarts 

of the world. This 
is a critique of the 
New York Times, 
Washington Posts, 
and 
Michigan 

Dailys — papers that 
strive for greatness 
but either ignorantly 
or willfully continue 
the marginalization 
of 
vulnerable 

populations. It’s easy 
to rest on the laurels 
of 
journalism’s 

success, 
but 
we 

cannot 
act 
like 

journalism 
is 

immune 
to 
the 

racism, 
sexism 

and 
bigotry 
that 

permeates 
society. 

The press often acts 

as an accountability measure for 
governments and corporations — 
it’s time we shined that spotlight 
on ourselves.

Visiting the Newseum: The power of the press

Defining “presidential” Drawing power from my 

name: Reclaiming Nada

The roommate selection process 

involved months of calculated 
messages, 
trying 
to 
finesse 

conversation, hoping the girl I met 
on Facebook would think I was 
super cool and ask to room with 
me. After painful awkwardness 
and anxiety, as well as the culture 
shock of a small town southern girl 
trying to keep up with the big-city 
New Yorker, we sealed the deal.

During our mini interview 

process, I remember explaining to 
her that I was Muslim and would 
probably need part of the room to 
pray, clarifying that if she had issues 
with that I totally understood and 
she could room with someone else. 
For some reason, it felt natural for 
me to be on the defense about my 
religion, but coming from New 
York and being a generally good 
person, she was entirely unfazed. 
That was one hurdle that I passed 
with ease.

The next hurdle was more 

difficult for some reason. I finally 
asked her for her number, which 
seemed out of order because 
we 
were 
already 
established 

as roommates, but I took the 
opportunity of a new conversation 
platform to slip this in.

Nada:
“Also, this is way overdue but it’s 

pronounced Nedduh.”

Lizzy:
“Lol oh nooo I’ve been thinking 

Nahdah this whole time.”

And who could blame her. I was 

kicking myself for letting this girl 
who I was going to be sleeping five 
feet away from not know my name 
after months of talking.

I was brought back to elementary 

school, introducing myself by 
my 
American 
pronunciation, 

Nah-dah; to my own sister not 
pronouncing my Arabic name until 
middle school; to taking Spanish 

for the first time and getting 
chuckles from the whole class at 
my teacher’s confusion during roll.

Nada 
means 
“nothing” 
in 

three different languages. Even 
knowing this, it was easy to just 
go with everyone’s assumptions 
and introduce myself this way. 

Poet Emily Dickinson wrote, “I 
am nobody. Who are you? Are you 
nobody too?” But I was worse than 
nobody. I was nothing.

The longer I introduced myself 

as nothing, the more nothingness 
became the foundation of my 
identity. There was a part of me that 
I associated with inadequacy and 
not being enough. Introductions 
became a source of anxiety, so 
I stopped making an effort to 
meet people. I started hating my 
parents for naming me Nada and 
my country for making that a 
possibility.

Then, the summer before high 

school brought me a beautiful new 
opportunity. New classmates. In 

what could have potentially been 
an awkward arranged playdate 
between 
another 
incoming 

freshman and me, I was delighted 
when my sister introduced me 
before I could sabotage myself. 
My new friend had no problem 
saying my name correctly, and 
she told me point-blank that I 
couldn’t let people continue to 
mispronounce my name. That 
would be misrepresenting who 
I was. She had a point; a country 
where children were taught to 
say Einstein, Guggenheim and 
Aristotle could surely manage two 
simple syllables.

Together, she and I created a 

sort of script that stuck with me 
from then on.

“Hi, my name is Nada. It’s like 

Ned, from the hit 2000s teen 
television show Ned’s Declassified, 
and then you add an –uh.”

“Okay so like *insert horribly 

mispronounced name here*?”

Cue the pause and slight squint. 

This is where I gave them a chance 
to try again, usually to no avail.

“Yeah, that’s close enough.”
This was a source of frustration 

for those close to me, when I would 
give up just to save someone else 
the effort of trying harder. I soon 
found out that the later realization 
of their mistake was even more 
embarrassing, 
especially 
when 

they heard someone else saying 
it correctly, usually prompting a 
“Why didn’t you tell me!”

While my initial insistence on 

people saying my name correctly 
stemmed from a desire to save 
others of future uneasiness, I 
realized recently that I should have 
wanted that for myself, not for 
anyone else.

My name ties me to my Egyptian 

heritage, culture and a language 
where Nada means the dew drops 
coating the earth in the morning. 
After 18 years, I finally learned not 
to compromise my identity or who 
I am for the comfort of others.

I’m about as far from a fine arts 

critic as one can get. I don’t consume 
art and I definitely don’t study art. 
Whenever I go to art museums, 
I usually spend more time on the 
benches than looking at the art. 
For that reason, I was surprised 
by my sentimental reaction to 
President Barack Obama’s official 
Smithsonian portrait.

As I walked toward the back 

of 
the 
presidential 
portraits 

exhibit to see Obama’s painting, 
familiar 
feelings 
of 
boredom 

and restlessness that tend to 
accompany these museum trips 
began to crop up. I passed former 
Franklin Presidents Pierce, James 
Buchanan and Chester Arthur on 
one side of the wall, and James 
Monroe, Grover Cleveland and 
William McKinley on the other. 
Almost all of the paintings were 
from a realistic art style, and all 
of the subjects had a similar pose 
— either sitting or standing with 
a stoic disposition in a plain room. 
Eventually, all of these portraits 
started blending together. As 

a result, the contributions and 
accomplishments of the men in the 
paintings didn’t seem so unique. 
When their official representations 
weren’t 
remarkable, 
their 

administrations didn’t appear to be 
either.

Obama’s painting, however, was 

different.

The green leaves stood in 

stark contrast to the white walls 
(and white faces) of the museum 
surrounding it. Even if someone 
didn’t know anything about the 
Obama administration, he or she 
could easily decipher it was unlike 
any administration the U.S. has 
seen before. Obama’s years at the 
helm were marked by bucked 
traditions — namely, by serving as 
our nation’s first Black president. 
In a nation built by slaves, that is a 
particularly notable achievement.

Admittedly, the first time I saw 

the portrait, I didn’t like it. “This 
isn’t presidential,” I thought as I 
scrolled through my Facebook feed. 
However, after seeing the painting 
with my own eyes, I now realize 
my definition of presidential isn’t 
an objective one; it’s simply based 
on what people in the past deemed 

to be “presidential.” The problem 
with using that standard as a 
criterion is that it was framed by 
a homogenous group of old, white 
men — many of whom upheld the 
institution of slavery and Jim Crow 
segregation.

Going by this standard, it’s easy 

to see why Obama’s portrait can 
come off as “un-presidential.” The 
problem isn’t with the painting, 
it’s with the label. There is nothing 
un-presidential about a man who 
humbly fought for racial, gender 
and marriage equality for eight 
years, just like there’s nothing 
un-presidential about having a 
Black man as a president (even 
though all 43 of his predecessors 
were not Black).

Obama’s presidency represented 

a different type of leadership, 
but it’s important to remember 
different isn’t inherently bad. In 
a similar vein, while Obama’s 
portrait definitely offers a stark 
contrast to the portraits of his 
predecessors, that difference alone 
doesn’t detract from its beauty. 
Obama’s painting — just like his 
presidency — was unique, and 
that’s what makes it so special.

Gun violence as a public health issue

The benefit of medical supply reallocation

O

n Feb. 14, 2018, a school 
shooting 
occurred 
in 

Parkland, Fla. at Marjory 

Stoneman Douglas High School. 
Seventeen people were murdered, 
and the country was left to mourn 
yet another senseless killing.

Since the 1999 shooting at 

Columbine 
high 
school, 
our 

generation has recognized the 
recurring 
incidence 
of 
mass 

shootings. Every time, the nation 
is shocked and motivated to 
change. But in reality, there has 
been a distinct lack of change 
on a policy level related to these 
shootings. 
The 
control 
the 

National Rifle Association has 
on politicians makes it hard to 
utilize the government as an agent 
of change. This control involves 
millions of dollars in contributions 
to numerous politicians in both 
political parties, making it difficult 
and unappealing to advocate for 
policies the NRA may not support. 
I believe after the Parkland 
shooting, however, national reform 
will finally begin to succeed. 
The students who survived and 
witnessed this act of violence have 
opposed the stagnation and lack of 
action over the past 19 years. Our 
generation is breaking the status 
quo by challenging politicians, 
the NRA, corporations and the 
American people for allowing 
these systemic problems to exist.

As I have written in previous 

columns, questioning your beliefs 
and engaging in direct political 
action spawns change. Yes, we 
can say education as a whole is the 
agent that could fix our nation’s 
problems. This could include 
teaching the reason for the current 
state of things or how to make them 
better for the future. I continued 
to echo this mantra time after 
time, but have begun to realize 
education is only one small portion 
of social change. When problems 
have very complex solutions, it 
is difficult to recognize the long-
term action that is required to 
disrupt the status quo.

The solution for gun control 

is nowhere close to simple. It may 
require a shifting of public rhetoric, 
bipartisan support, research and 
education. And changing the 
laws and actions in our country 
will not happen overnight. But 
the most effective way could be 

to look at gun regulation from a 
public health approach. Our nation 
has watched political action fail 
repeatedly. We have even watched 
a digression in regulation and laws 
in states across the nation.

Yet, public health approaches 

have been used to regulate and 
increase the safety of automobiles 
and air pollution in the past. 
For example, according to the 
National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, in 1946 there were 
9.35 deaths per 100 million vehicle 
miles traveled. As speed limits 
were lowered, seatbelts were 
required, and safety reporting was 
heightened, this rate dropped to 
1.18 in 2016.

Nicholas Kristof, a New York 

Times columnist, also advocates 
for this public health approach to 
decrease the rate of shootings. He 
argues the “liberal approach” to 
regulate guns is “ineffective”. One 
of the first steps in reducing gun 
violence in the U.S. is research. Our 
country faces a disproportionate 
amount of gun violence and 
gun-related fatalities compared 
to other nations. According to a 
study in the American Journal of 
Medicine, Americans are 25 times 
more likely to be killed by guns 
than citizens of other high income 
countries. Though this striking 
data is important to take into 
account, there is an overwhelming 
lack of research conducted on 
gun ownership, training and 
violence. Funding needs to be 
allocated to federal organizations 
to complete this research to attain 
a comprehensive conclusion about 
the trends in this violence.

Furthermore, 
increasing 

background checks and limiting 
the access that young people 
have to guns is an important step 
to increase the efficacy of gun 
regulation. Current background 

checks are only required for gun 
sales at licensed dealers. As a 
result, it is not difficult for guns to 
change hands to other buyers after 
this process, undermining the 
goal of the surveillance. Kristof 
says, “Our laws have often focused 
more on weapons themselves 
(such as the assault weapons 
ban) rather than on access.” 
Mass shootings are not the most 
common type of gun violence, but 
they are often the most publicized 
because of their horrific display of 
violence. Scrutinizing individuals 
to strict background checks and 
training would make the U.S. 
more similar to the processes 
that other countries require gun 
owners to complete.

It is too easy to get firearms 

in our country. A recent article 
in the New York Times compares 
how guns can be purchased in 15 
countries. Australia, responding 
to a 1996 mass shooting, requires 
gun owners to be a part of a 
shooting club, provide reasoning 
for owning a gun, pass a thorough 
background check and apply for a 
permit for a specific type of gun. 
The multiple steps that buyers 
are required to undergo have 
resulted in a drastic decrease of 
gun violence.

The students who survived 

the 
Parkland 
shooting 
are 

using their anger, grief and 
frustration to create important 
change. We cannot allow the 
danger and violence that stems 
from guns to persist. Kristof 
writes, “Yet more Americans 
have died from gun violence, 
including suicides, since 1970 
(about 1.4 million) than in all the 
wars in American history going 
back to the Revolutionary War 
(about 1.3 million).” Regulating 
guns to reduce the number of 
deaths and violence will not 
be easy, nor will it happen all 
at once. From a public health 
approach, it requires changing 
the environment and focusing 
on taking small steps that will 
eventually lead to increased 
safety and important change.

W

hile 
many 
of 
us 

spent Spring Break 
sunbathing 
on 

warm beaches, visiting friends 
and family or indulging in an 
unhealthy dose of Netflix while 
huddled under a mass of warm 
blankets, hundreds of University 
of Michigan students travelled to 
the most impoverished regions of 
the world to bring about positive 
social change. These service-
oriented 
students 
witnessed, 

for a week, what hundreds of 
millions of people experience 
throughout 
their 
lifetimes: 

Ravaging 
illnesses, 
systemic 

impoverishment and minimal 
access to basic health care.

The 
World 
Health 

Organization 
cites 
severe 

shortages of sterilized needles 
and gloves as one of the main 
reasons for why 40 percent 
of 
medical 
injections 
in 

impoverished 
countries 
are 

classified 
as 
“unsafe.” 
Ten 

nations, with a combined 100 
million people, have no access 
to any kind of cancer treatment. 
Even underfunded international 
hospitals fortunate enough to 
receive vaccine and medicine 
donations 
from 
charities 

oftentimes lack the basic gauze, 
syringes and bandages needed to 
administer the life-saving drugs.

Despite the United States 

spending over $10,000 per person 
on health care annually, many 
countries spend fewer than $10 
per person each year. What does 
this mean? It means hundreds 
of millions of people rely on 
damaged, expired, unsterilized 
and unsafe medical supplies. 
It means millions of people 
needlessly die of premature and 
preventable deaths.

Conversely, 
the 
U.S. 
has 

a gluttony of excess medical 
supplies that end up as waste. 
The U.S. disposes of more than 
4 billion — with a “B” — pounds 
of medical supplies each year. 
These discarded supplies end 
up in landfills, contribute to 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, 

increase the cost of health care 
and don’t go to people in need. 
Though a majority of disposed 
medical supplies are no longer 
usable, 13 percent of all disposed 
medical supplies are never used 

in the first place and an estimated 
50 percent of single-use supplies 
could be safely reprocessed.

The University is not an 

exception to this problem. Despite 
an 
ambitious 
sustainability 

initiative to reduce University-
produced waste by 40 percent 
from 2006 to 2025, the University 
is failing, and waste levels have 
actually increased over the past 12 
years. Michigan Medicine is one 
of the main culprits and continues 
to discard thousands of pounds 
of medical supplies every day. 
Worse yet, Michigan Medicine 
has thrown out an estimated 
$180 million of pristine, unused 
medical supplies since 2006. In the 
three minutes it takes you to read 
this article, nearly $100 of unused 
medical supplies were discarded 
in our very own backyard.

So what can we, as students, 

do to address this tremendous 
global health disparity?

Blueprints For Pangaea is a 

startup, nonprofit organization 
founded by University students 
to 
reallocate 
excess 
medical 

supplies from our local hospitals 
to 
impoverished 
countries 

overseas. Since 2015, Blueprints 
For Pangaea shipped more than 
30,000 pounds of medical supplies 
— valued at $2.5 million — from 
Michigan Medicine to hospitals in 
Ghana, Niger and Myanmar.

By collaborating with hospital 

administrators, doctors, nurses 
and volunteers, Blueprints For 
Pangaea 
is 
already 
making 

a major impact by reducing 
domestic medical supply waste 
mismanagement and by providing 
more accessible health care to 
countless people around the world. 
Nearly 10 Blueprints For Pangaea 
chapters have sprouted up across 
the country and are exponentially 

increasing the amount of medical 
supplies 
that 
are 
salvaged 

and redistributed from their 
respective universities (yes, even 
Michigan State University and 
Ohio State University).

Other University students on 

campus have joined the cause. 
Some are forging connections 
and providing medical supplies 
to doctors affiliated with medical 
disaster-relief organizations like 
the Syrian American Medical 
Society. Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity Program and pre-
medical students are supporting 
“spring cleaning” drives in their 
laboratories and clinics to collect 
and donate unneeded medical 
supplies. Planet Blue volunteers 
are 
increasing 
awareness 
of 

waste and sustainability issues. 
Still, other students are using 
alternative spring break programs 
as an opportunity to fill a carry-on 
suitcase with life-saving medical 
supplies as they travel to some of 
the most impoverished areas of 
the world.

In ways both big and small, 

our fellow University classmates 
are saving lives.

Now that Spring Break is over 

and campus is alive with students 
and future leaders, we are again 
called to fulfill the University’s 
mission 
statement 
to 
“serve 

the people of Michigan and the 
world.” I urge you to consider 
what you can do this spring to 
combat medical supply waste 
here in Ann Arbor and to help 
save lives abroad. Do not consider 
this spring’s Earth Day as an 
event, but a target.

Between now and April 22, 

join a student or professional 
organization 
dedicated 
to 

alleviating international health 
disparities 
and 
unnecessary 

medical supply waste. Encourage 
your 
laboratory 
and 
clinic 

mentors to initiate a medical 
supply 
“spring 
cleaning” 

program if they do not already 
have one. Join the Earth Day 
2018 movement to “End Plastic 
Pollution.” Do your part to help 
the Earth and the people on it.

A

s I type this, I am 
currently sitting in a cafe 
on the streets of Bogotá, 

Colombia, about two blocks from 
the U.S. Embassy, waiting for 
an emergency passport so I can 
return home. The following is 
a true recounting of events that 
transpired over my 2018 Spring 
Break.

For my Spring Break, some 

friends and I planned a 10-day 
trip to Cartagena, Colombia. We 
traveled in a fairly large group, 22 
of us in total. I would like to think I 
was among the most excited for the 
adventures ahead, because I had 
never been on an airplane before, 
let alone traveled outside the 
country. Had I known what would 
befall, I imagine I would have felt 
therwise.

After arriving Friday, we spent 

the first evening buying groceries, 
exchanging currencies and just 
settling into the apartment complex 
we rented. The next day we would 
go to the beach and see how 
sunburnt we could get. I have an 
affinity for water and, as one should 
expect, as soon as we arrived, I 
threw my bag onto the pile with 
everyone else’s and jumped in.

Now, 
being 
University 
of 

Michigan students who generally 
act in rational manner and try to 
think ahead, we left two or three 
fellows “guarding” the bag pile at 
all times. It also turns out that being 
a large group of white Americans, 
we were swarmed by vendors like 
I’ve never seen before the entire 
time we were at the beach. As the 
vendors distracted us, someone 
was able to sneak in and grab my 
bag off the top of the pile.

When we were all sufficiently 

burnt and the time came to pack 
up and hail a taxi back to the 
apartments, I noticed my bag 
was not with the others. My first 
thought was that someone was 
either playing a prank on me or had 
idly grabbed my bag, thinking it was 
their own. Once I returned to the 
rooms and interrogated everyone, 
I decided the next step was to call 
my bank and cancel my debit card 

as a precautionary measure. It was 
then that I discovered my card had 
actually been attempted at an ATM 
near the beach, and I realized I had 
indeed been robbed.

The fact I had been robbed was 

slightly less unsettling than the fact 
that my bag not only contained my 
(brand new, bought for this trip, 
three-day-old) phone, my wallet 
with all my money and all forms of 
picture identification, but also my 
passport — the only way to enter 
back into the U.S. They had stolen 
my ticket home.

As a foreigner in a country 

where I could not speak a lick of 
the language, it was quite difficult 
to figure out where to even began 
the process of getting home. After 
several calls to the U.S. Embassy, I 
discovered that I needed to travel to 
Bogotá in order to get an emergency 
passport. Easy, right? Fat chance. 
Bogotá is over 1,000 kilometers 
from Cartagena (or about 620 
miles) 
through 
dangerous 

countryside and hundreds of miles 
of unpopulated national parks. My 
best chance was to fly there, but 
how does one fly with no form of 
identification? Well, several more 
calls to the embassy later, I now 
know that I must go to the police to 
file a report, get it signed and print a 
picture of my passport.

That same evening, I went to 

the “police station” with a friend 
who spoke minimal Spanish. We 
walked in and were greeted by a 
lone officer sitting in a dimly lit 
room, only slightly bigger than 
my closet. His desk was bare save 
a typewriter that was at least 70 

years old and thoroughly surprised 
me when it actually worked. The 
officer proceeded to type up a 
report and upon completion gave 
us the paper and told us we had to 
get to the other end of town to file 
it. A 20-minute taxi ride later, we 
discovered this next police station 
was only open during regular 
business hours and it was still 
Saturday evening.

After foregoing most of the 

weekend excursions to get my 
paperwork in order and prepare 
myself for a flight to Bogotá, 
Monday rolled around and I was off 
again with my Spanish-speaking 
friend. Four hours of waiting in 
line, a game of pass-and-play risk 
and an hour-long meeting later, I 
finally had my signed police report.

Thanks to the multitude of 

help I received from my University 
family, after a post to Facebook 
looking 
for 
English-speaking 

contacts in Bogotá, I was able to get 
a trustworthy ride from the airport 
to the embassy and had a ride 
waiting for me afterwards.

As I sat in this restaurant, 

continuing to wait for my ticket 
home, I couldn’t help but think 
how lucky I was to be an American 
citizen, when so many people are 
being ripped from their homes and 
displaced by war, famine, fire or 
deportation. I know my country, 
friends and family are there for 
me and were ready to help me get 
home, when I was terrified I might 
be stuck there for much longer than 
anticipated.

I have always been fond of the 

saying “you win or you learn, there 
is no losing” and I have indeed 
learned a great deal. I learned to 
always lock your valuables up and 
avoid traveling or going out with 
them whenever possible. But most 
importantly, I learned a newfound 
appreciation for my friends, my 
family and my country. I have 
learned that I should take nothing 
for granted.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Monday, March 5, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Soccer Mommy’s ‘Clean’ 
is great, simple indie rock

Covering herself in blood, 

dancing around her room in front 
of her dead boyfriend’s corpse, 
Soccer Mommy finds serenity. 
Or at least what appears serene. 
As she pours out red liquid 
from a coffee mug leaning over 
the edge of a rooftop, her face 
— bearing a nose ring, piercing 
hazel eyes and a stoic expression 
— is hard to read. Her mouth 
looks equally ready to break into 
a grimace or a smile. By killing 
her boyfriend, she’s released 
from the emotional abuse, no 
longer his dog to lick his feet, 
and she basks in this freedom. 
Freedom to defile him, play 
videogames and waltz alone. 

Finally, she has the space she 
wanted to breathe and the room 
he never gave her. But at the 
end of this macabre party, after 

dragging the deceased around 
for the three minutes of single 
“Your Dog,” Soccer Mommy 
rubs his arm tenderly, and looks 
a little sad. Her face still doesn’t 
betray her precise feelings, but 
in her fingers is longing.

Soccer Mommy cites punk and 

grunge as musical inspirations, 
and the influence shows in the 
“Your Dog” music video. The 
video for Nirvana’s “Heart-
Shaped Box” comes to mind 
when she draws a black cross on 
the dead boyfriend’s forehead, 
and lyrically the two songs 
tackle the same theme. They feel 
trapped in a bad relationship.

Bad relationships are the 

running concern on the DIY 
indie rocker’s effective debut 
album Clean. Over alternatively 
soft and subtly vicious chord 
progressions, she sings about 
unfollowed 
desires, 
self-

doubt and disappointment. On 
“Cool,” the grittiest she gets 
instrumentally, 
she 
wishes 

she could have the cold, casual 
aesthetic of the romanticized 
“cool-girl,” the kind of girl who 
will never love back and who 
will never care. The kind of girl 
the guy she wants would want.

That desire comes back again 

and again. It’s on “Last Girl,” a 
jumpy and upbeat track where 
she wishes she was her lover’s 
last girl. “I want to be like your 
last girl / ’Cause she’s got looks 
that drive you all down / Loved 
the way she wears her makeup,” 
she sings, thinking that things 
might go differently if only 
she was different, if only she 
was cool like the last girl. On 
“Scorpio Rising,” she watches as 
a guy she likes looks over a girl 
“bubbly and sweet like a Coca-
Cola.”

She’s not alone here. Soccer 

Mommy 
— 
the 
project 
of 

Nashville-based Sophie Allison 
— fits nicely alongside the 
talented class of female indie 
rockers who are leading the 
genre’s resurgence, artists like 
Mitksi, 
Julien 
Baker, 
Adult 

Mom, Ian Sweet and Phoebe 
Bridgers 
(whom 
Allison 
is 

currently on tour with). Women 
armed with stunning guitar 
riffs, catchy melodies in minor 
keys, a tint of grunge and, often, 
a biting malaise. Each of these 
artists have played with this idea 
of wanting different skin, often 
the skin they think their lovers 
want. Mitski considers shedding 
her ethnicity for a boy on “Your 
Best American Girl”; Julien 
Baker misses a former self on 
“Appointments.”

Soccer Mommy falls on the 

quieter end of this group, not as 
strapping as Mitski or as grand as 
Julien Baker. Her arrangements 
are sparse, almost always as 
simple as a stripped guitar and 
her clear, intimate vocals. Clean 
finds her experimenting with 
newer, heavier sounds while 
still honing her eye for the 
simplistic. Much of the album 
is built around the sound of 
breakthrough singles “Allison” 
and “Out Worn,” which gained 
traction 
on 
Bandcamp 
and 

through 
social 
media 
sites 

like Tumblr and Twitter. At 
times Clean can suffer from 
the apprehension that follows 
such a breakout, as if she never 
intended to make it in the first 
place and is still figuring out 
what kind of star she might want 
to be.

Mostly she avoids this though, 

and the best moments on Clean, 
like “Your Dog” and closer 
“Wildflowers,” suggest a more 
confident woman behind the 
guitar than we’ve heard from 
her before, and as her first foray 
into producing something as 
large as an album, she hits the 
mark not by attempting the high 
dive, but rather by perfecting her 
form in shallower water.

‘Seven Seconds’ is timely 
but is ultimately lacking

When it comes to developing 

a 
narrative 
that 
can 
be 

sustained over a season, the 
television crime drama has 
a few options: the classic 
whodunnit, 
the 
compelling 

whydunnit, 
the 
less 

conventional unto-whom-was-
it-done (see “How to Get Away 
with Murder” season 3) or even 
some “Big Little Lies”-esque 
combination of the three.

“Seven 
Seconds,” 
a 
new 

10-episode Netflix series from 
showrunner Veena Sud (“The 
Killing”), quickly lets us know 
it won’t be concerning itself 
with any of those questions; 
they’re all answered about 
three minutes into the first 
episode. In a rush to meet his 
pregnant wife at the hospital, 
off-duty Jersey City cop Pete 
Jablonski (Beau Knapp, “Sand 
Castle”) 
speeds 
through 

Liberty State Park and hits 
Brenton Butler, an African-

American 15-year-old riding 
his bike.

It’s 
not 
what 
it 
looks 

like. It was an accident. But 
Jablonski’s supervisor in the 
narcotics unit, Mike DiAngelo 
(David Lyons, “ER”), is quick 
to remind the rookie cop that 
to a fraught American public, 
everything is what it looks like. 
Jablonski is a white cop and 
Brenton a Black boy. “They’re 

gonna crucify you for this,” 
DiAngelo snarls. So Brenton 
Butler is left to die in the snow 
and a cover-up ensues.

Assistant District Attorney 

K.J. 
Harper 
(Clare 
Hope-

Ashitey, “Suspects”) and her 
partner Detective Fish Renaldi 
(Michael 
Mosley, 
“Sirens”) 

are tasked with investigating 
Brenton’s killing, a journey that 
leads them right back to the 
Jersey City Police Department. 

The fundamental question that 
propels “Seven Seconds,” then, 
is this: How deep is the moral 
rot of the institutions designed 
to govern and protect us? And 
is it possible to find even a 
semblance of justice in them? 
These aren’t particularly easy 
concepts 
to 
navigate, 
and 

at times, the show seems to 
crumble under their sheer 
weight.

Literally, 
yes, 
the 
hit-

and-run takes place in the 
middle of winter. But there’s 
also an excessive coldness 
and gloom to the writing 
and 
cinematography 
of 

“Seven Seconds” that make 
it exhausting to watch. The 
show is littered with lingering 
stone-faced 
stares 
and 

troubled characters haunted 
by vaguely-alluded-to pasts, 
as if to say, “Don’t forget, this 
show is prestige television!” 
K.J. 
is 
a 
self-destructive 

alcoholic, and Jablonski is 
perpetually frowning. When 
nearly 
every 
character 
is 

broken and dysfunctional for 
no reason, “Seven Seconds” 
becomes sluggish and devoid 
of feeling.

The exception that proves 

the rule is the fantastic Regina 
King 
(“American 
Crime”), 

who gives a rich, layered 
performance as Latrice Butler, 
a grieving, untethered mother 
whose faith has been shaken 
by the death of her son. The 
circumstances 
of 
Brenton’s 

death are admittedly different 
than those of Trayvon Martin 

or Tamir Rice, but Latrice’s 
suffering still feels real and 
resonant.

Given the extensive time 

the show also spends focused 
on Jablonski and his agony, 
it would be easy for “Seven 
Seconds” to veer into what we 
might call “Three Billboards” 
territory — where Black pain 
exists only as an accessory to 
a story of white redemption, 
and forgiveness is doled out 
to brutal, hateful people who 
haven’t necessarily earned it. 
But to her credit, Sud has a 
remarkably light directorial 
touch, and there’s never any 
sense that viewers should be 
feeling one way or another.

The other side of that coin 

is a story that’s often aimless 
and meandering — in desperate 
need of tighter editing and 
fewer 
subplots. 
“Seven 

Seconds” 
is 
occasionally 

rewarding, but much like the 
justice system itself, too slow-
moving and unfulfilling to 
pack a punch.

Live action Oscar shorts 
continue to pack a punch

The 
Oscar 
nominees 
for 

Live Action Short this year 
are a mixed bag in topic, 
tone and execution. The five 
nominees touch on everything 
from the mistreatment of deaf 
British school children to the 
systematic racism that existed 
a century after abolition in the 
South — sometimes testing the 
integrity of the edges of dusty 
theater seats, and at times 
accomplishing no more than 
a chorus of groans from the 
audience to skip on to the next 
one. 

“DeKalb 
Elementary” 

depicts 
in 
real 
time 
the 

harrowing 
half-hour 
that 

follows 
an 
armed 
intruder 

entering a school. All one scene, 
shot entirely in the school’s 
front office, featuring only two 
main characters throughout, 
“DeKalb” finds success in its 
simplicity. 
It 
doesn’t 
dress 

up the conflict to heighten 
the stakes because it doesn’t 
need to — more than enough 
tension is created by virtue 
of 
the 
situation. 
“DeKalb” 

is an ode to human empathy 
and 
understanding 
in 
the 

tight spaces where it ought 
to exist the least, and strong 
performances from everyone 
involved make it a front runner 
for this award.

“The Silent Child” has a plot 

too convoluted for a short. It 

pits a social worker against her 
patient Libby’s mother when 
the mother makes Libby forgo 
learning sign language to learn 
lip reading and speech therapy 
in its place. Difficulty explaining 
the plot in a sentence does not 
bode well for a 20 minute run 
time. The short could have 
been saved had it not lay such 
focus on the mother. It tries too 
hard to build her up as some 
misguided villain while losing 
sight of the far more interesting 
relationship between Libby and 
her caretaker. The filmmakers 
throw up statistics about deaf 
children suffering in the British 
public school system before 
the credits roll, making the 
whole thing feel more like a 
manipulative humane society 
ad than an Oscar nominated 
short film.

“My 
Nephew 
Emmitt” 

tells an unfortunate tale of 
Black subjugation in postwar 
America. 
Slavery 
had 
been 

outlawed 
almost 
a 
century 

before, yet Moses Wright and 
his family are powerless to 
stop a group of white men who 
come to take away their visiting 
relative for flirting with a white 
woman 
in 
town. 
“Emmitt” 

is reminiscent of this year’s 
“Mudbound” in both setting 
and sentiment. It’s certainly 
not as fleshed out as the feature 
film (not that it realistically 
could be), but manages to carry 
a similar weight. 

“The Eleven O’Clock” is 

the only comedic nominee of 

the five. The short plays off 
the gag of a psychiatrist whose 
patient is living the delusion 
that he is a psychiatrist, too, 
leading to some funny moments 
within the confusion. But the 
strong concept leaves itself a 
little long, and almost outstays 
its welcome. In a way, the 
interaction between the two 
men 
devolves 
too 
quickly, 

becoming loud and absurd too 
fast, breaking the suspension 
of disbelief that either one of 
the characters shown could 
be an actual trained medical 
professional. 
It’s 
difficult. 

“Eleven” is unique in this field 
of five for its playful approach, 
but falls short for that same 
reason. There isn’t enough meat 
behind it, yet it is a refreshing 
change of pace from the darker 
tone that pervades the rest of 
the category. 

“Watu Wote” mirrors the 

real-life 2015 story of a group 
of Muslims who protect their 
fellow Christian bus passengers 
from a group of Al-Shabaab 
terrorists. 
The 
Muslims 

conceal the Christians within 
their ranks, staring down rifle 
barrels without giving them 
up. “Wote” starts off slow, 
taking its time establishing the 
main character with Muslim 
prejudices so that they can be 
squashed later on. The actual 
event of the bus being held 
up doesn’t occur until about 
halfway through the short, but 
the execution of the sequence 
doesn’t disappoint.

‘Film Stars Don’t Die In 
Liverpool’ lacks relevance

The age-gap romance has 

been 
repeatedly 
explored 

in sitcoms and soap operas, 
movies and literature, so the 
setup for “Film Stars Don’t 
Die in Liverpool” sounds like 
a tired subject matter. We’ve 
all seen the Gloria and Jay 
Pritchetts of the world. We’re 
used to the alarming difference 
in age between actors and 
actresses (as in a 61-year-old 
Liam Neeson starring opposite 
a 29-year-old Olivia Wilde in 
“Third Person”). However, the 

typical gender roles are flipped 
in director Paul McGuigan’s 
latest 
film. 
Instead 
of 
a 

bland, rich man with a young, 
attractive 
girlfriend, 
this 

film, based on a memoir of the 
same title, pairs a renowned 
former movie actress with a 
younger lover. For McGuigan, 
whose filmography consists 
largely of action movies like 
“Gangster No. 1,” this romantic 
adaptation is a surprise.

“Film Stars Don’t Die in 

Liverpool” 
examines 
the 

relationship between Gloria 
Grahame 
(Annette 
Bening, 

“20th Century Women”) and 
Peter 
Turner 
(Jamie 
Bell, 

“Man On A Ledge”) in the late 
’70s and early ’80s. Grahame, 
notorious for her vanity and 
brief 
success 
in 
the 
’50s, 

realizes her death is imminent 
after a long struggle with 
breast cancer. She reconnects 
with her old flame, Turner, 
a stage actor, and joins his 
family in Liverpool. A series of 
flashbacks reveal their history, 
but unfortunately the script 
does not stretch adequately 
into Grahame’s acting heyday. 
As a result, screenwriter Matt 
Greenhalgh avoids making a 
significant, relevant political 
statement about the treatment 
of older actresses and what

FILM REVIEW

happens 
after 
fame. 
The 

concentration 
remains 
on 

her final years in obscurity 
without a comparison to her 
life in the spotlight.

Bell 
and 
Bening 
deliver 

strong performances, milking 
depth out of the thin writing. 
Bening mixes regalness with 
spunky wit and tries to elevate 
the portrayal of Grahame. Bell 
also does a good job, playing 
off of Bening with believable 
chemistry. 
However, 
the 

lackluster script holds back 
both actors and does not do 
the memoir justice. Despite 
the 
winning 
acting, 
the 

casting of Bell and Bening 

does not make sense with the 
real life people involved in 
the story. The down-to-earth 
Bening does not match the 
divaness of Grahame, nor does 
the introspective Bell align 
with the easygoing Turner. 
In the end, this story with so 
much potential falls short of 
expectations.

“Film Stars Don’t Die in 

Liverpool” had early Oscar 
buzz 
that 
quickly 
faded 

following its initial release 
in the United Kingdom. With 
such a rich background to pull 
from given Gloria Grahame’s 
messy, 
often 
scandalous 

career, the script really does a 

disservice to her colorful life. 
Grahame won an Oscar in 1952 
for her work in “The Bad and 
the Beautiful” and appeared 
in blockbuster hits like “It’s 
a Wonderful Life” and “In a 
Lonely Place.” Although the 
film touches on some of her 
most well-known works, it 
skates over her intoxicatingly 
complicated 
marriages 

and 
professional 
exploits. 

Bening prevents the hectic 
writing from swallowing this 
fascinating woman completely, 
but overall “Film Stars Don’t 
Die in Liverpool” kills off its 
best material before it has the 
chance to grow.

SONY PICTURES CLASSICS

‘An American Marriage’ 
is an instantaneous classic

The title of “An American 

Marriage” might conjure up a 
stilted vision of the American 
dream 
inflected 
by 
1950s 

nostalgia: 
gingham-print 

aprons, towheaded children, 
suburban purgatory. It’s a 
white-washed understanding 
of Americana, and I’m not just 
talking about the picket fences. 
But this is exactly the notion 
of what makes a marriage 
“American” that Tayari Jones’s 
accomplished 
new 
novel 

interrogates, complicates and 
ultimately dismisses. In its 
place, Jones offers a vision of 
marriage in modern America 
that is raw and complex, and 
asks us to consider how the 
most intimate parts of our 
lives can be shaped by national 
narratives beyond our control.

Celestial 
Davenport 
is 

strong-willed and formidable, 
a 
folk-artist 
from 
Atlanta 

who makes custom dolls. Roy 
Hamilton is ambitious and 
entrepreneurial, 
determined 

to rise above his small-town 
Louisiana roots and make 
a name for himself. Both 
are 
graduates 
of 
southern 

historically-Black colleges and 
universities, navigating what 
it means to be a part of “What 
the rest of America thinks of as 
middle-middle-class and what 
Black America calls upper-
middle-class” in a country 
still haunted by the pre-
Civil Rights traumas of their 
parents and grandparents.

From the beginning, Jones 

insists on the intersection of 
the personal and political. 
Celestial and Roy’s tumble 

into a passionate and often 
volatile marriage blends easily 
into the canon of “universal” 
narratives, speaking to the 
optimistic ease with which 
young people commit to a 
lifetime together before they 
can possibly understand how 

long a lifetime really is. But 
their marriage is also hemmed 
tightly 
to 
the 
particular 

circumstances 
of 
race, 

history 
and 
socioeconomic 

status. Celestial, who comes 
from 
greater 
economic 

privilege, 
is 
constantly 

aware of this imbalance in 
their relationship, and Roy’s 
mother criticizes him for not 
marrying a woman of his own 
social class so he can “Lift 
somebody up with him.” They 
both want their children to be 
raised in a world where they 
aren’t constantly reminded of 
their race. As Roy says, “I’m 
not going to remind my kids 
that somebody died in order 
for me to do everyday things.”

Their expectations of one 

another’s gender roles adds 
another layer of complication 
to their marriage. Roy is 
conservative, constantly needs 
affirmation of his masculinity 
and expects his wife to be 
subordinate. 
Celestial 
is 

stridently 
feminist, 
insists 

that they remove “to obey” 
from 
their 
wedding 
vows 

and 
feels 
pressured 
into 

motherhood regardless of her 
own doubts: “Is motherhood 
really optional when you’re 
a perfectly normal woman 
married to a perfectly normal 
man?” Jones’s gift for nuance 
makes it possible for readers to 
root for this couple and, in the 
same breath, question whether 
their relationship is entirely 
healthy.

Then tragedy strikes: Roy is 

falsely accused and convicted 
of rape, and sentenced to 12 
years in a Louisiana prison 
— known to be one of the 
worst states for Black men in 
the justice system. When his 
conviction is overturned five 
years later and he is released 
into the world, he and Celestial 
must 
contend 
with 
the 

destruction of their American 
dream by a systematically 
unjust 
justice 
system 
and 

with the new people they’ve 
become.

The narrative is instantly 

classic: one part “To Kill a 
Mockingbird,” one part “The 
Count 
of 
Monte 
Cristo.” 

But it is also contemporary, 
immediate and keenly critical. 
Jones’s greatest gift as a writer, 
besides 
the 
lyrical 
beauty 

of her prose and compelling 
complexity of her characters, 
is her ability to see the forest 
for the trees, to understand 
the silent forces that guide our 
lives and to fight for the right 
to choose a different direction. 
With “An American Marriage,” 
Jones testifies to an expanded 
understanding 
of 
whose 

stories need to be included 
in the canon of “universal” 
American 
narratives, 
and 

carves a place for herself as 
one of the great chroniclers of 
American life.

Big Ten Champion hats perched on 

their heads, music blaring, a group of 

Michigan players trot off the confetti-

littered podium, toward the locker 

room, singing “Empire State of Mind” 

by Jay-Z at the top of their lungs.

Water bottles fly through the 

visitors’ locker room — dousing 

the Michigan players, coaches and 

staff — as John Beilein turns his 

congratulatory speech into a team-

wide dance circle.

“Surreal,” 
said 
senior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman as 

he described the scene after Michigan 

had capped off its second consecutive 

Big Ten title. The senior guard — once 

a two-star recruit — earned a spot on 

the all-tournament team.

It was all real, of course. The 

trophy. Four wins in four days. Again. 

The confetti falling from the roof. 

The maturation of a team once an 

afterthought, rapidly evolving into a 

juggernaut.

A swarm of reporters rush to the 

locker room to greet sophomore 

Jon Teske — “Jon Sleep,” Abdur-

Rahkman calls him — the largest man 

in the room who so rarely garners the 

attention his stature would imply. 

Teske’s role, perhaps, has been the 

most steady of any player all season 

— the defensive-centric, offensively-

limited backup center, who plays 

12 minutes a game, stifles shots at 

the rim, and keeps himself quiet on 

offense. Tell that to Isaac Haas, the 

7-foot-2 center for Purdue who Teske 

turned into a poster and then let Haas 

know, en route to 14 points in the 

biggest game of Teske’s life. 

This championship was because 

of him.

Walk out into the hallway and find 

Beilein with a reflective tone.

“Duncan Robinson, for example,” 

Beilein says, amid a question of team 

growth.

“Growth” is a peculiar way to 

describe a fifth-year senior who says 

he “(doesn’t) have the young legs I 

once did,” he said.

In recent weeks and months, 

Robinson has been crystal clear about 

the need to play with urgency. These 

are his last few games of organized 

basketball until, well, maybe ever. 

He’s just a couple months removed 

from being benched for a freshman 

amid a prolongued shooting funk. If 

the 42-percent career 3-point shooter 

wasn’t going to make threes, what 

was he going to do?

“I just want to help. As a guy who’s 

been through it, I want to help us 

win,” he says after playing 32 key 

minutes in the tournament 

final, in which he limited 

Purdue forward Vincent 

Edward to just four 

points. For a fifth-

year senior who 

spent much of 

his career as the 

butt of opposing 

scouting 

reports, 

“growth” 
is 

underestimating 

his 
defensive 

transformation. 

As his 3-point stroke 

has resurfaced, his defensive 

revelation is a major reason for the 

team’s new defensive identity.

This championship was because 

of him.

But no one gets to claim ownership 

of the 6th-ranked defense, by adjusted 

defensive efficiency in KenPom.com, 

more so than Luke Yaklich.

The assistant coach stands in 

the middle of the room, unable to 

drop a gaping smile. He shakes 

each reporter’s hand, eagerly and 

earnestly 
engaging 
with 
each 

question, not skipping a beat as he 

high fives Charles Matthews who 

chooses to take a lap around the 

room in his towel. Freshman Ibi 

Watson shakes hands with Yaklich, 

as Yaklich turns back to him and says, 

“I love you, dawg.”

After he was hired from Illinois 

State, Yaklich met with Beilein, 

expecting a traditional welcome. 

Instead he got a question he never 

expected.

‘What do you think we need to do 

better?’

Yaklich couldn’t believe that the 

11-time NCAA Tournament head 

coach was asking him. “I need to 

learn how to teach defense better,” 

Yaklich recalls Beilein saying.

This championship was because 

of him.

It’s impossible, though, to mention 

the defense — one that held Purdue, 

a team that averaged 82 points 

per game, to just 66 points in the 

final — without talking about 

its leader.

The 
first 
drill 
of 

practice 
in 
July, 

Yaklich told the 

team they would be doing 

slides — dives on the floor. 

Instead of complaining, 

Simpson marched right 

up to the front and said, 

“I’ve 
got 
you, 
Coach 

Luke.”

“He backed up every bit of talk 

that he told me the first couple weeks 

on the job,” Yaklich said. “He backed 

it up with effort every single day.”

Simpson shut down each of his 

four opponents in this weekend’s 

Big Ten Tournament, as the four 

opposing point guards shot 11-for-36.

This championship was because 

of him.

But it wasn’t just about the leaders. 

For a guy like Jordan Poole, who came 

to Michigan with more than enough 

swag to go around, the evolution to a 

championship team supercedes him. 

Poole, who has been asked to make 

winning plays, not just his personal 

highlights, notched two 

steals in the title 

game, 

forced 

two 

other turnovers and dove into the 

stands to save a ball destined to go out 

of bounds.

“When I look at stuff like this, it’s 

more than myself,” Poole said. “It’s 

definitely for the guys around me. For 

guys who put in so much work, when 

you work so hard. Guys like (Abdur-

Rahkman), who’s been here for four 

years, and Duncan who’s been here 

for four years.”

This championship is because of 

him.

Perhaps 
most 
embodying 
an 

individual sacrifice for the greater 

good of the team, fifth-year senior 

guard Jaaron Simmons stands by 

his locker, removing his jersey as the 

whole scene unfolds. Simmons, who 

transferred from Ohio University 

this past offseason as the presumed 

starting point guard, didn’t start all 

season. He averaged just 1.6 points 

per game. Less than a year ago, 

Simmons’ name was in the NBA draft 

pool. None of that mattered to him. 

This was his first conference title. He 

was just excited to earn an automatic 

berth to the NCAA Tournament, an 

adventure he’s never experienced.

“I can’t really explain it,” Simmons 

said. “I’m happy as hell.”

This championship is because of 

him.

Oh, and Moritz Wagner. The 

German star who nearly turned 

his NCAA Tournament showcase 

a season ago into an NBA contract. 

Instead, he came back to school to be 

the face of this team, to dazzle some 

more crowds with his array of skills, 

then ride off into the NBA sunset 

once and for all.

But it didn’t start as planned.

“I thought Moe, in that first 

semester 
was 
really 
pressing. 

Trying to do too much. Finally 

when we came to this second 

semester, he got through that 

injury, I think he understood 

really how we have to do things, and 

really became a better defender.”

Wagner rode a team-high 17 

points in the final to snag the Most 

Outstanding Player award.

This championship is because of 

him.

Then there’s Beilein, the man at 

the top pulling every string, getting 

the most out of every player. Purdue 

coach Matt Painter told reporters 

after the game, “You learn something 

every time you play them.”

Yet one of the most decorated 

coaches in college basketball had 

the audacity to loosen the reins and 

figure out why his team had never 

finished higher than 37th in adjusted 

defensive efficiency. 

This championship was because 

of him. 

And everyone else.

Derrick 
Walton 
carried 
last 

year’s team to glory, and that’s all 

well and good. But this is a team 

that found a new hero each night. 

A team that played the first part of 

the season with a revolving door at 

point guard. A team that admitted it 

wasn’t as offensively gifted as many 

of Beilein’s best and didn’t make that 

a barrier.

Instead it became one of the best 

defensive teams in the country. 

A 
team 
that 
needed 
serious 

contributions from two transfers 

after unexpectedly losing one of its 

best to the draft and two others to 

graduation. A team that begged for 

big-time contributions from unripe 

freshmen, and then got above and 

beyond. A team that was told all 

year it wasn’t tough, and didn’t say 

otherwise. It showed otherwise.

As he stood on the podium at 

midcourt, Beilein summoned his 

best Bo Schembechler impression 

to consider what made this team a 

champion.

“A team, a team, a team.”

WOLVERINES WIN SECOND STRAIGHT BIG TEN TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONSHIP


2B — Monday, March 5, 2018
SportsMonday
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A mad start to Michigan’s March

M

arch is just four days 

old. It has 
already been 
full of mad-
ness.

The Michi-

gan women’s 
basketball, 
men’s bas-
ketball and 
hockey teams 
all played in 
the Big Ten Tournament over 
the weekend, and all three 
punched their tickets to the 
NCAA Tournament in the pro-
cess.

In Indianapolis, the No. 6 

seed women’s basketball team 
set out to correct course after 
a late slide characterized the 
end of its regular season. A 2-4 
record in February wasn’t a 
good look for a Wolverine team 
once ranked as high as No. 13 
in the Associated Press Top 25, 
even if one of those wins came 
against then-No. 13 Maryland.

In its first contest on Thurs-

day, Michigan breezed past 
No. 11 seed Penn State to earn 
a 77-48 victory, as its star duo 
of senior guard Katelynn Fla-
herty and junior center Hallie 
Thome came within six points 
of outscoring the Nittany Lions 
on their own. Thome poured 
in a game-high 22 points 
and fell one rebound shy of a 
double-double, while Flaherty 
was right behind her with 21, 
including five triples.

But in the quarterfinal round 

Friday, even the trusted hands 
of Flaherty and Thome failed 
the Wolverines, as turnovers in 
transition on two consecutive 
possessions in the final 2:30 
cost them dearly in a 61-54 loss 
to the third-seeded Cornhusk-
ers.

Despite the disappointing 

tourney finish, with a 10-6 con-
ference and 22-9 overall record, 
Michigan is still projected to be 
a No. 8 seed in the NCAA Tour-

nament according to ESPN’s 
most recent Bracketology 
report. After missing out on the 
Big Dance in infamous fashion 
a year ago, the Wolverines seem 
poised to return for the first 
time since coach Kim Barnes 
Arico’s debut season at the helm 
of the program in 2012-13.

Back in Ann Arbor, the 

hockey team hosted Wisconsin 
for a best-of-three series in the 
first round of its conference 
tournament. Michigan wouldn’t 
need all three games — though 
that was in question at certain 
points of Friday’s opening 
period.

Michigan scored first just 

1:40 into the game, but the 
Badgers roared back with three 
consecutive goals, jumping out 
to a 3-1 lead and silencing the 
crowd at Yost Ice Arena. By the 
end of the period, though, the 

Wolverines would be back on 
top. With three straight goals 
of its own off the power play, 
Michigan took a 4-3 lead into 
the first inter-
mission.

Senior for-

ward Tony 
Calderone com-
pleted his hat 
trick to open the 
second period, 
but Wisconsin 
came up with 
a pair of power 
play goals as well 
to tie the game at 
five. It took a fourth goal from 
Calderone halfway through the 
third period to seal a 6-5 win.

There was less drama Sat-

urday night, but no shortage of 
goals, as the two teams com-
bined to find the back of the 
net another 11 times. It was the 

Badgers who opened the scor-
ing and the Wolverines who 
answered back with three goals 
of their own this time around. 

But Wiscon-
sin couldn’t 
match Michi-
gan’s offensive 
firepower two 
nights in a row, 
and the Wolver-
ines earned a 7-4 
win to advance 
to a second-
round matchup 
against No. 6 
Ohio State next 

Saturday.

Perhaps more importantly, 

Michigan is sitting comfort-
ably at No. 8 in the Pairwise 
rankings, which means a near-
certain return to the NCAA 
Tournament in Mel Pearson’s 
first year as head coach after a 

disastrous 2016 season.

That brings us to New York 

City, the ‘Mecca of basketball’ 
and Michigan’s second consecu-
tive Big Ten Tournament cham-
pionship.

Four games in four days isn’t 

easy any way you slice it, but 
as far as luck of the draw is 
concerned, the fifth-seeded, 
15th-ranked Wolverines weren’t 
dealt the easiest hand.

First up was Iowa, a team 

Michigan had swept but 
couldn’t afford to look past. 
Whether the Wolverines or the 
officials were more to blame, 
Thursday’s opening game did 
not bode well for their tourna-
ment chances. As foul trouble 
hindered all three captains, the 
Hawkeyes pushed Michigan to 
overtime, where the Wolver-
ines finally pulled themselves 
together to take a 10-4 edge in 

the decisive period.

Then came Nebraska, which 

had embarrassed Michigan in 
a 20-point win in Lincoln. But 
Friday, the Wolverines gave the 
Cornhuskers a taste of their 
own medicine. Michigan went 
11-for-13 from beyond the arc, 
and four players hit double 
figures en route to a nearly 
20-point victory of its own.

After that, a date with No. 2 

Michigan State awaited. The 
Wolverines had beaten the 
Spartans by 10 points at the 
Breslin Center in January, and 
Michigan State was eager for 
revenge. But Michigan was hav-
ing none of it Saturday, riding a 
49-point second-half outburst 
to another double-digit victory.

And finally, the Wolverines 

would have to play a champion-
ship game against the only team 
in the Big Ten they had yet to 
beat in No. 8 Purdue. And not 
only had they lost to the Boiler-
makers, they had lost to them 
twice. While Purdue was a top-
five team in the country on both 
of those occasions, Michigan 
lost by just five points com-
bined. Sunday, the Wolverines 
ran away from the Boilermakers 
— opening up a lead as large as 
18 points late in the second half 
— and right to another Big Ten 
Tournament title.

Michigan may not have won 

the most games, but it certainly 
looks like the best team in the 
conference. Now, the Wolver-
ines have the trophy to prove 
it. With another automatic bid 
into the NCAA Tournament, 
Michigan can make that point 
even stronger by outlasting its 
familiar foes in the Big Dance.

That makes three Wolverine 

teams all seemingly destined 
for NCAA Tournament runs.

Brace yourselves, Michi-

gan fans. This could be a mad 
March.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

The Michigan men’s basketball team kicked off what should be an excitement-filled March with a Big Ten Tournament Championship.

Teske’s grand slam

NEW YORK CITY, NY — It 

felt like a scene out of a movie. 

Jon Teske — the Michigan 

men’s basketball team’s placid, 
soft-spoken center — gathered 
his 
momentum 
outside 
the 

block, leapt and threw down an 
emphatic, and-one dunk. Put 
on a poster was Purdue’s Isaac 
Haas, a seven-foot-two, 290-
pound behemoth who makes 
a living bullying others in the 
paint.

But here was Teske, the polar 

opposite 
of 
his 
demonstra-

tive teammate Mortiz Wagner, 
doing the bullying on the big-
gest, tallest player in the Big 
Ten. And it happened on the 
biggest stage nonetheless; the 
lights of a championship game 
at Madison Square Garden can 
melt the composure of even the 
most poised players.

Teske doesn’t ooze that type 

of swagger. His teammates and 
coaches have publicly noted his 
“quiet” demeanor and need for 
more confidence on the floor.

But after Teske generated 

one of the most shocking high-
lights of the Big Ten Tourna-
ment, he looked like he was 
born for it, vaulting down the 
floor with a thunderous scream 
that was drowned out by the 
roar of the crowd. Duncan 
Robinson, meanwhile, jumped 
twice in jubilation. 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman 
first-pumped 
like 

he was throwing a 
punch. The bench 
exploded like a fire 
had been lit under 
the chairs.

“I’m a quiet guy,” 

Teske said. “That 
passion, my love for 
the game kind of all 
spilled out.”

Added freshman forward Isa-

iah Livers: “Oh my. Even though 
my ankle was hurt, I shot up as 
fast as I could and was grabbing 

my head like, ‘Did he really just 
do that?’ Because usually he’ll go 
up, do a little layup, get fouled. 
But he was thinking dunk the 
whole time. He was hunting.”

Hunting is not Teske’s M.O. 

His influence 
isn’t typically 
reflected 
in 

the box score, 
even 
though 

he’s been an 
essential part 
of Michigan’s 
defensive 
turnaround 
this 
season. 

He came into 
the 
tourna-

ment averaging just over three 
points and three rebounds per 
game.

But on Sunday, Teske got a 

vote of confidence from one of 

his teammates, and it might’ve 
been the difference.

“Today’s your day, man, ” 

Livers recalled telling Teske. 
“It’s a great matchup today so if 
you want to be a dog, I got you 
today.”

Haas was too much for Wag-

ner early. He scored Purdue’s 
first seven points and forced 
the eventual tournament MVP 
to the bench just over two min-
utes in. At that point, Michigan 
coach John Beilein yelled down 
his bench. He and the Wolver-
ines needed Teske more than 
ever.

The 
backup 
center 
came 

through. Just moments after 
he’d subbed for Wagner, Teske 
cleaned up his own miss for his 
first bucket of the afternoon. 
Then he and Abdur-Rahkman 
executed a pick-and-roll to per-

fection, diving into the lane for 
a dunk that eliminated the Boil-
ermakers’ final lead of the eve-
ning.

And with the Wolverines 

nursing a one-point lead late in 
the first half, Teske and Robin-
son ran the pick-and-roll again, 
but this time Teske stopped 
and popped a 10-footer. Less 
than a minute later, he a took a 
pass from redshirt sophomore 
Charles Matthews and hit from 
just inside the arc — no hesita-
tion involved.

Chants of “Teske! Teske! 

Teske!” filled the Garden.

The pair of connections were 

emblematic of Teske’s growth 
since the start of his collegiate 
career. Teske played just 60 
minutes all of last season. It was 
spurt here, a spurt there, never 
having the chance the make an 

impact. He looked uncomfort-
able — even timid — on his rare 
chances.

But on Sunday, he would let it 

fly on a shot he’s only attempted 
a handful of times this season — 
part of a career-
high 
14-point 

effort on 6-of-9 
shooting.

“It’s been an 

ongoing 
thing 

throughout 
the 

year, 
pushing 

him to play big-
ger 
than 
his 

quiet voice kind 
of allows him to 
sometimes,” said 
assistant coach Saddi Washing-
ton. “I’m just so happy for Jon 
because in this moment, when 
we really needed him to step up, 
he did it in a major way.”

Added Livers: “I think he 

needed the confidence, he need-
ed the ‘go.’ He was waiting on 
the ‘go’ from coaches, but we’ve 
got his back so whatever he 
chooses to do, we’re right there 
with him.”

Beilein has attached pictures 

of dogs to the Wolverines’ lock-
er room whiteboard at various 
point over the past two champi-
onship seasons. It’s a mentality 
he desires his each of his players 
to carry — one that defies Mich-
igan’s historical reputation as a 
skill-based, finesse team.

Teske is no finesse player. 

He’s a Midwest-born bruiser. 
But Teske hasn’t adopted that 
“dog” mindset like some of 
teammates — at least until Sun-
day.

Repeatedly, 
he 
frustrated 

Haas and center Matt Haarms 
defensively, offering resistance 
that few opponents have been 
able to match this season. 

“I’m just happy he chose the 

dog route today,” Livers said, 
“rather than the old Jon.”

Nothing embodied that more 

than Teske’s dunk over Haas.

It was a moment that sur-

prised many, carried the arena 
into 
near-pandemonium 
and 

made the championship’s result 
clear with the Wolverines grip-
ping an 18-point lead with just 
over six minutes to play. 

And for Teske, it was a 

moment two years in the mak-

ing. Finally, he’d 
broken out of his 
shell on the floor 
— on the biggest 
stage against the 
one of the coun-
try’s best cen-
ters.

“Our 
play-

ers 
were 
like 

in awe,” Wash-
ington said. “It 
was almost like 

he had elevated himself to that 
next level. The challenge for 
him will be, ‘You set a new level 
for yourself, now play at that 
level.’ ”

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

“Did he really just do that?” said Isaiah Livers in reference to this rim-rattling dunk from Jon Teske during the final minutes of Michigan’s 75-66 win over Purdue.

“I’m just happy 

he chose the 
‘dog’ route 

today.”

“That passion, 
my love for the 
game kinda of 
all spilled out.”

Michigan’s sophomore center scored a career-high 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting in Michigan’s 75-66 win over Purdue

March has

full of 

madness.

Abdur-Rahkman gets much-deserved recognition

NEW 
YORK 
CITY, 
NY. 

— 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman wasn’t sweating his 
team’s upcoming matchups with 
powerhouses No. 2 Michigan 
State and No. 8 Purdue.

He was playing Xbox — 

Fortnite, specifically. He had time 
to learn the challenging game and 
win while he was in New York.

You can’t fault the laid-back 

attitude. 
Michigan, 
perhaps 

the hottest team in the country, 
proceeded to pummel both teams 
with relative ease to win back-
to-back Big Ten Tournament 
Championships. The senior — as 
he has always done — was just 
trying to lay low each night.

But with constant buzzing 

in Madison Square Garden and 
rainbow 
confetti 
veiling 
the 

top of their Champion hats two 
days later, the captain could no 
longer fly under the radar — he 
was literally center stage on 
the championship platform at 
midcourt.

Throughout 
four 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
games, 
Abdur-

Rahkman led the Wolverines 
with 15 points per game on 
54-percent 
shooting 
and 

averaged 3.5 boards, 2.8 assists 
and a steal each contest. Despite 
winning the championship last 
year, the glitz and glam victory 
felt even sweeter now.

“It’s a little more exciting this 

year because I am the captain so 
I have a bigger hand in it than 
last year,” he said. “You always 
envision (being a leader) until 
you step on campus and actually 
see what’s going on and what you 
have to do to get to this point.”

Abdur-Rahkman’s 
sound 

statline warranted a place on 
the 
All-Tournament 
Team, 

a designation that came as a 
pleasant surprise to him. When he 
heard his name called, he didn’t 
realize what it was for. When he 
did, he smiled and posed for the 
cameras. The 6-foot-4 guard was 
finally noticed.

“I just had that chip on my 

shoulder all season and ever 
since I got on campus,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. “I’m glad to see 
that the hard work is paying 
off. I’m kind of a guy that goes 
unnoticed a lot so when you get 
that recognition it feels good.”

Beyond just his nickname on 

the team — “Rahk” — Abdur-
Rahkman 
was 
Michigan’s 

figurative rock all season.

Whether it was his game-

winning free throws to top 
Maryland, his double-double and 
late triple to conquer Texas or his 
unconscious shooting displays 
at Maryland and Purdue, the 
Wolverines needed him to win.

The 
tournament 
was 
no 

exception.

Abdur-Rahkman squashed the 

Spartans’ comeback attempt with 
a late three that swirled around 
the rim before sinking through. 
When Purdue gave its last-ditch 
effort in the finals, his mid-range 
jumper hit the iron, climbed over 
and in to halt the Boilermakers’ 
momentum. And each game, he 
shut down his opponent on the 
defensive end.

Abdur-Rahkman’s 
confusion 

of being on the All-Tournament 

team really shouldn’t have been 
confusion at all. It was proof of 
how a quiet captain gripped the 
reins of his team and flourished. 
He knows he’s not a vocal 
provocateur like fellow captain 
Moritz Wagner or a rambunctious 
personality like freshman Jordan 
Poole, but his presence is still 
palpable and loud in its own right.

“Man, he’s been the most 

consistent player we’ve had all 
year,” said assistant coach Saddi 
Washington. “But 
it’s not surprising 
because 
if 
you 

look at his career, 
he’s just grown 
a little bit every 
year, every game. 
And this year, he 
had to take the 
responsibility 
of 
turning 
into 

Batman and stop 
being Robin.”

But even Batman would try to 

conceal his true identity. While 
his natural ability was no secret 
to his teammates, his consistent 
play 
perplexed 
defenses 
all 

season. He was, as Washington 
calls him, the “silent assassin.”

“You see how throughout this 

entire year he’s been stepping and 
being big for us, making big time 
shots,” Poole said. “And it hasn’t 
been a fluke, he’s been super 
duper consistent.”

Abdur-Rahkman 
and 

consistency pair together like 
peanut butter and jelly. They have 
essentially acted as synonyms, 
a benchmark for the rest of the 
team to work for.

With 
an 
unusually 
long 

break between the Big Ten 

Tournament 
and the NCAA 
Tournament, 
the Wolverines 
will 
have 
to 

strategize how 
to 
continue 

their hot streak 
into 
March 

Madness 
— 
staying 

consistent, 
if 
you 
will. 

Abdur-Rahkman, 
despite 

garnering 
attention 
and 

accolades, will fill the time 
between now and then the best 
way he knows how — laying low.

“I think I’ll just stick to 

playing Xbox. A little Fortnite 
and Call of Duty.”

Blanco feels right at home

There’s no place like home.
Tapping her heels together, 

those magical words enabled 
Dorothy to go full circle in her 
journey — from Kansas to Oz, and 
then back to Kansas.

For Michigan utility player 

Tera Blanco, no words could have 
described the situation better as 
she recorded her second home 
run of the season against No. 
8 Baylor at the Judi Garman 
Classic held Friday in Fullerton, 
Calif — a meeting ending with a 
6-3 Wolverine victory.

Watching the ball sail past the 

fence, she made her way across 
the bases towards a familiar 
place.

First base. Second base. Third 

base. Home.

Blanco — a California native 

from Huntington Beach — is no 
stranger to hitting home runs. A 
former All-American, the senior 
had a career total of 26 home 
runs coming into the season. She 
produced a .404 batting season 
her sophomore year.

Despite 
her 
production 

dropping last year, Blanco proved 
against the Bears that she still 
has it with her first at bat of the 
game. Coming up to bat, she 
walked to the home plate she had 
been accustomed to for years.

Growing up less than 30 miles 

from Fullerton, Blanco attended 
the very event 
that she would 
take part in years 
later, 
playing 

for the team she 
found 
herself 

watching 
time 

and time again.

Now she had 

the 
chance 
to 

do what she had 
always dreamed 
of as a child.

Standing at the plate, Blanco 

readied herself to face a Baylor 
pitcher and staff that had only 
allowed more than two runs in a 

game once all season.

An early run was essential for 

instilling confidence in offense 
that 
had 
been 
inconsistent 

throughout the season.

“We give our kids certain, 

‘front-line focus,’ we call it,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“Front-line focus is a military 
term and to focus on, you know, 
the message, which is to simplify 
the game for them. Most games 
we have a plan where there’s a 
certain pitch to hit, where there’s 
a certain way to stand in the box 
and that’ll change from game to 
game, and really from pitcher to 
pitcher, but they embraced and 
they believed in it and so they 
executed it well.”

Front-line focus was what 

the Wolverines needed to build 
consistency.

Just before Blanco came up 

to bat, junior second baseman 
Faith Canfield led off the game 
by hitting a single. With a runner 
at first, junior outfielder Natalie 
Peters hit a ball toward third base 
that was mishandled by the Bears 
third baseman, allowing the two 
to advance a base.

Standing at home plate with 

her family in the crowd, Blanco 
watched as two pitches flew by 
in front of her. Both were called 
balls. Cocking back her bat for the 
third pitch, she could tell right 
away it wasn’t going to be the 
same as the last two.

And the home run proved it.

Her 
eyes 

trailed the ball 
as it flew past 
left field, and she 
grinned 
while 

making 
her 

way around the 
diamond. 
With 

an 
entourage 

waiting to meet 
her 
at 
home 

plate, and her 
hometown 
and 

family close by, she tapped her 
heels not against each other, but 
against the plate — feeling right 
at home.

Front-line focus 

was what the 
Wolverines 

needed.

‘M’ sweeps Judi Garman Invitational

Music blared out of a portable 

speaker in the dugout. The 
Michigan softball team began to 
dance.

With their game against No. 

8 Baylor in a rain delay, the 
25th-ranked Wolverines used 
the break to stay loose and 
have a little fun. That attitude 
paid off as Michigan went 5-0 
in the Judi Garman Classic in 
Fullerton, Calif., this weekend 
to raise its overall record to 13-6.

At 
first, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

offense seemed rife with the 
same inconsistencies that had 
plagued them all season as they 
struggled to climb out of an 
early 2-0 hole against Loyola 
Marymount.

Luckily, Michigan had Tera 

Blanco.

With a runner on third base 

and the Wolverines trailing, 2-1, 
the senior utility player smacked 
a single down the left field line 
to tie the game. Two innings 
later, with runners on first and 
second, she hit a walk-off single 
that gave Michigan the win, 3-2.

Throughout the tournament, 

Blanco 
and 
junior 
second 

baseman Faith Canfield served 
as catalysts for the Wolverines. 
In Thursday’s second game, a 
5-0 win over Charlotte, Blanco 
got the win on the mound while 
Canfield had three RBIs.

Blanco continued her hot 

streak the next morning. She 
stepped up to the plate in the 
first inning with two on and 
nobody out against the Bears, 
then smacked a home run to give 
Michigan a 3-0 lead with one 
swing of the bat. That was when 
the offense flipped a switch. The 
Wolverines put up three more 
runs — including one on a home 
run by Canfield — for a 6-3 win.

“We saw (our upperclassmen) 

step up,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “ … And the 
confidence that it gave our team, 
we carried through the whole 
weekend.”

No. 18 Louisiana Lafayette 

couldn’t quiet Canfield, as her 
home run and two-run single 
provided the Wolverines with 

all the runs they needed in a 3-1 
win.

And on Saturday against Cal 

Poly, the offense truly let loose 
and put up 11 runs in a blowout. 
Senior utility player Aidan Falk 
had three RBIs, including a two-
run home run, while Blanco 
added a two-run double.

“We just try to simplify 

things,” Canfield said. “We 
felt like in Texas (last week) 
we were trying to do a little bit 
too much and so (we) just came 
to play it and have some fun. … 
When we have fun (we) just play 
better.”

But 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

outburst 
didn’t 
just 
come 

from the seasoned veterans. 
Freshman utility player Lou 
Allan came up clutch with a 
pinch-hit two-run single to open 
the scoring in the game against 
the 49ers. And on Saturday, 
sophomore 
catcher 
Abby 

Skvarce hit a game-ending two-
run homer against the Mustangs 
— the first of her career.

“Sometimes they’re trying 

too hard,” Hutchins said, “but 
I liked our groove. I liked our 
confidence and it gave us some, 
they were a little more loose in 
the end.”

The 
usually-dominant 

pitching, meanwhile, did just 
enough to secure wins for the 
Wolverines. 
Freshman 
left-

hander Meghan Beaubien gave 
up runs in all three of her starts 

— against the Lions, Baylor and 
Cal Poly. But she also escaped a 
jam against the Mustangs after 
re-entering with runners on 
second and third and one out 
and took over in the seventh 
inning against the Ragin’Cajuns 
to earn the save.

Blanco picked up two wins. 

One came in a start against 
Charlotte 
— 
in 
which 
she 

pitched five scoreless innings 
with five strikeouts — and 
the other against Louisiana 
Lafayette, where she was tasked 
with keeping the Ragin’ Cajuns 
off the board with runners on 
first and second and Michigan 
clinging to a 3-0 lead.

And though Hutchins used a 

quick hook with her, freshman 
right-hander 
Sarah 
Schaefer 

continued getting looks. She 
allowed only one run across 
three appearances, though she 
recorded four walks with no 
strikeouts.

“Our approach is just to get 

outs and focus on one pitch at a 
time,” Blanco said. “Just do our 
part and be effective.”

For a team that has at times 

seemed tight and tentative, 
the Judi Garman Classic was a 
completely new look. And if this 
weekend was any indication, a 
fun-loving approach could be 
what sparks the Wolverines to 
more wins.

And if it does, they’ll have 

plenty more to dance about.

Faith Canfield was a catalyst for Michigan’s offense over the weekend.

A spring break tour that was so 

promising two weeks ago finally 
came to an end Sunday as the 
Wolverines (3-8 overall) lost to 
No. 8 Stanford (11-1) by a score of 
7-4.

The trip had not only offered 

Michigan the chance to finally 
play some meaningful baseball 
after 
a 
long 
offseason, 
but 

also to escape from the winter 
weather. After a quick three 
game series in Florida against 
Army, the Wolverines traveled 
west to California, where they 
participated in the Tony Gwynn 
Legacy tournament, played a 
game against San Diego State 
and then wrapped up with a four 
game series against the Cardinal.

The Californian portion of 

the trip was particularly dismal 
for the Wolverines, with the 3-1 
series loss to Stanford capping off 
a tough start to the season.

Michigan only recorded two 

hits in a 7-0 shutout loss Friday. 
Striking out twelve times and 
stranding all three of their 
baserunners, 
the 
Wolverines 

weren’t able to get anything going 
offensively 
against 
Stanford’s 

starter Tristan Beck.

If you can’t score you can’t 

win. Michigan’s pitching staff 
faced an uphill battle all night 
long. With that being said, the 
Wolverines’ number one, senior 
Alec Rennard, didn’t pitch his 
best game. In five innings of 
work, he let up six hits and had 
four earned runs. Junior reliever 
Troy Miller also saw time, 
allowing two runs on two hits.

Saturday’s early matchup was 

a much closer affair though. 
In fact, Michigan was up 2-0 
heading into the bottom of the 
ninth, 
when 
freshman 
Jeff 

Criswell gave up a walk-off 
three run homer to Stanford’s 
Tim Tawa. The ending wasn’t 
indicative of the Wolverines’ 
overall performance. Sophomore 
lefty Tommy Henry allowed only 

five hits in seven shutout innings.

Coming off the back of the 

demoralizing loss earlier in the 
day, Michigan bounced back to a 
degree in Saturday’s second game. 
Sophomores Karl Kauffman and 
Jack Weisenburger showed just 
what the Wolverine pitching 
staff is capable of, allowing three 
hits combined as they shutout the 
Cardinal in a 5-0 win.

“Tommy 
Henry 
and 
Karl 

Kaufmann pitched really well 
Saturday,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. The most important 
thing for them is to throw their 
off-speed pitches for strikes. 
When you get in to an extended 
outing, for Tommy and Karl to 
pitch deep into the game they 
need to throw multiple pitches 
for strikes, and that’s exactly 
what they did. Very encouraging 
signs for sure.”

Offensively, 
shortstop 
Jack 

Blomgren had two RBIs on two 
hits, while senior catcher Brock 
Keener scored twice. Michigan 
also took advantage of four 
errors on the part of the Cardinal 
defense.

If Saturday’s second game 

showcased 
the 
best 
of 
the 

Wolverine’s 
pitching 
staff, 

Sunday’s loss accomplished the 
exact 
opposite. 

Excluding a great 
performance by 
freshman 
Ben 

Dragani, 
who 

didn’t allow a hit 
in four innings, 
Michigan’s 
pitching was at 
times mediocre. 
Senior 
Jayce 

Vancena allowed 
five hits and four 
earned runs in just over an inning 
of work. Junior Will Tribucher 
didn’t fare much better, as he 
walked three people and allowed 
a run in relief of Vancena. On 
the other side of Dragani’s 
performance, 
junior 
Jack 

Bredeson also struggled before 
the team turned to freshman 
Angelo Smith to pitch the eighth 

inning.

“Yeah Jayce didn’t have a 

good day,” Bakich said. “It was 
just as simple as that. He’s one of 
our starting pitchers, he’s one of 
our better guys. In order for our 
team to have a good season, we’re 
going to need him to be good. I 
would say today was just more a 
fluke than anything else.”

The 
Wolverines 
out-hit 

Stanford but were unable to turn 
their baserunners into runs for 
the most part. Redshirt junior 
outfielder Miles Lewis led the 
way going 2-3 with 2 RBIs and 
a run. Ako Thomas, Michigan’s 
most prolific hitter in the series, 
also went 2-4 and scored on 
an RBI groundout by junior 
outfielder Jonathan Engelmann.

A series loss to the eighth-

ranked team in the country 
wasn’t necessarily unexpected 
for the relatively young and 
inexperienced 
Wolverines. 

The 
team 
showed 
obvious 

improvement over the course 
of the series, and played much 
better than they had in their first 
four games in sunny California.

Michigan’s start to the season 

is clearly worrisome, but as they 
return to Ann Arbor, optimism is 
still in the air.

“I 
think 

(the 
team) 
is 

encouraged,” 
Bakich said. “We 
were 
a 
couple 

plays away from 
being 
3-1 
this 

weekend instead 
of 1-3.

“We 

challenged 
ourselves. I just 
looked 
at 
the 

schedule numbers, we have the 
number one strength of schedule 
in the country. For a young team 
with a lot of guys who haven’t 
gotten a lot of repetitions, this 
(trip) has been good. I wouldn’t 
be surprised if we got really hot 
because of getting punched in 
the mouth over the past couple of 
weeks.”

Michigan seals semifinal berth, likely NCAA Tournament bid with 7-4 win

The chanting began with 

17 minutes to play in the third 
period.

Michigan 
sophomore 

defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce 

lasered a shot from the left 
point past Jack Berry, giving 
the Wolverines a three-goal 
lead. “Be-rry, Be-rry, Be-rry,” 
the Children of Yost taunted the 
Wisconsin goaltender, who had 
allowed six goals off 22 shots for 
a ghastly .727 save percentage. 
Later in the period, the jeers 
returned — “You suck!” followed 
by an obscenity.

With four minutes to play, 

Berry was gone. The Badgers 
pulled him in favor of an empty 
net, sacrificing their last line of 
defense for a desperate chance 
at the two goals that would have 
extended their season.

The Children’s chants kept 

coming. But the goals didn’t.

With a 7-4 victory Saturday at 

Yost Ice Arena, the Wolverines 
(20-13-3 overall, 11-10-3 Big Ten) 
not only clinched a semifinal date 
with No. 6 Ohio State next week, 
but also all but punched their 
ticket to the NCAA Tournament 
in coach Mel Pearson’s debut 
season.

Wisconsin 
(14-19-4, 
8-13-

3) opened the scoring just 23 
seconds after the initial puck 
drop 
when 
forward 
Ryan 

Wagner slipped around junior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi 

and fired just above sophomore 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne’s 

right shoulder. But Michigan was 
quick with a response.

Four minutes and 18 seconds 

into the game, Badger forward 
Trent Frederic was knocked 
off the puck in his own zone, 
the loose change bouncing to 
Dexter Dancs in the high slot. 
On Friday, the senior forward hit 
the pipe deep in the third period 
with the Wolverines up one, 
missing a chance to potentially 
seal the game. Dancs made no 
such mistake this time, snapping 

a wrister into the upper-left 
corner to equalize.

The rest of the period trended 

in Michigan’s direction. With 
6:19 
remaining, 
sophomore 

forward Nick Pastujov found 
Jack Becker with a line-drive 
pass from the right wing, and 
the freshman forward’s eighth 
goal of the season gave the 
Wolverines a 2-1 lead that stood 
until intermission. It could have 
been more — just 30 seconds 
prior, sophomore forward Adam 
Winborg’s tip off a point shot was 
disallowed after official review.

In the second period, it was 

Michigan’s turn for a first-
minute 
goal. 
A 
hard-nosed 

forecheck 
effort 
by 
junior 

forward Brendan Warren led to 
an attacking opportunity, but 
Wisconsin 
defenseman 
Peter 

Tischke cleared it inches in front 
of the line. Tischke was merely 
delaying the inevitable, though 

— the rebound bounced outside 
to freshman defenseman Quinn 
Hughes, and Warren finished 
what he had started by tipping 
Hughes’ point shot past Berry.

However, 
the 
Wolverines 

were unable to make it four 
straight goals, as the next 19 
minutes were effectively played 
on a seesaw. Six minutes into the 
period, Badger forward Linus 
Weissbach shot just wide from 
the point, but Lavigne left his left 
post open and Cameron Hughes 
took advantage off the rebound 
to make it 3-2.

Twenty-six 
seconds 
later, 

Michigan came roaring back. 
Senior forward Niko Porikos 
jumped on a turnover in the 
Wisconsin zone and bolted down 
the left flank, with Cecconi 
and freshman forward Dakota 
Raabe joining him on a three-
on-one. Four flicks of the stick 
later — Porikos to Cecconi to 

Porikos to Raabe to the net — the 
Wolverines were back in front by 
two.

“I’ve talked about that a lot, 

our secondary scoring — we’ve 
got 
more 
guys 
contributing 

which we need,” Pearson said. 
“And I think that’s part of the 
success of the second half, that’s 
why we’ve won, whatever it 
is, 12 games second half of the 
year. But we’re getting more 
contributions from more players. 
We put a couple guys in tonight, 
we won a game, we were able to 
slot two guys in tonight. Porikos 
does a nice job on the one goal, 
makes a great play to Raabe.”

Wisconsin 
replied 
halfway 

through the period, as its top line 
continued to match Michigan 
blow for blow. Wagner found 
Frederic all by himself in the 
middle of the slot, and Frederic’s 
shot hissed past Lavigne’s glove.

The two teams held serve for 

almost the entire remainder of 
the period. But “almost” wasn’t 
enough for the Badgers — on a 
two-on-one with seven seconds 
to go in the period, Dancs, who 
opened the scoring, fired home 
the eventual game-winner to put 
the Wolverines up, 5-3.

“To be honest, I didn’t know 

there was seven seconds left on 
the clock,” Dancs said. “We were 
in the middle of a shift, and I just 
shot and it went in, and it was a 
good goal.”

Wisconsin forward Matthew 

Freytag added a garbage goal 
in front of the net with 4:42 to 
play, forcing Michigan to keep 
its feet glued to the gas pedal. 
The situation was reminiscent 
of so many that took place down 
the stretch of the season, where 
Pearson has constantly stressed 
the importance of learning to 
play with a lead.

“I was never comfortable in 

the game,” Pearson said. “Even 
when it was 6-4, I was never 
comfortable until that last goal, 
then you could breathe a sigh 
of relief. That’s just the way the 
game was. They’ve got so many 
dangerous players, you give them 
a little bit of room or time or 
space, they make plays and they 
can score.”

But 
Lavigne 
was 
never 

seriously threatened, needing to 
make only one save. And with 18 
seconds left, sophomore forward 
Jake Slaker chipped home the 
empty-net 
clincher, 
allowing 

Pearson and the Wolverines to 
breathe easy.

Michigan was able to exhale 

in a larger sense, too. With the 
win, the Wolverines maintained 
their position at No. 8 in the 
Pairwise Rankings, far beyond 
the precarious influence of the 
NCAA 
Tournament 
bubble. 

Their season is basically ensured 
to 
continue, 
regardless 
of 

whether or not they fall to the 
Buckeyes next weekend.

“Well, I hope so,” Pearson said. 

“I don’t know where we’re at, but 
we’ve got a goal of winning the 
Big Ten championship. We’re 
trying to get as far as we can and 
then let the chips turn and fall 
where they may. We know that if 
we just continue to win, we’ll be 
in great shape.”

Of 
course, 
winning 
the 

Big Ten championship would 
automatically put Michigan in 
the tournament — no ifs, ands or 
buts about it.

And the Wolverines — after 

winning just 13 games last year, 
their lowest since 1987, after 
being picked to finish sixth out 
of seven teams in a loaded Big 
Ten, after languishing in the 
high-20s in Pairwise as late as 
mid-January — are now just two 
games away from doing so.

“We’re playing really good 

hockey right now,” Slaker said. 
“We have six games left to win 
a national championship. We’re 
not looking too far ahead, we’re 
just going to focus on the next 
game.”

Led by Calderone and Dancs, Wolverine seniors secure legacy at Yost

The Michigan hockey team’s 

Senior Night officially took place 
last Saturday against Arizona 
State. 
After 
the 
Wolverines 

closed the regular season with a 
5-3 victory over the Sun Devils, 
the sellout crowd at Yost Ice 
Arena 
honored 
the 
six-man 

senior class — forwards Tony 
Calderone, Dexter Dancs, Alex 
Roos and Niko Porikos, along 
with defensemen Sam Piazza 
and Cutler Martin.

Traditionally, Senior Night 

marks the last time that a 
graduating class plays in its own 
arena in front of its own fans. But 
that wasn’t the case this year.

One week after the festivities, 

Michigan was back at Yost — this 
time to take on Wisconsin in a 
best-of-three quarterfinal series 
of the Big Ten Tournament. 
With two straight wins, the 
Wolverines advanced to the 
semifinals, where a road trip to 
No. 6 Ohio State awaits.

Saturday’s 7-4 triumph over 

the Badgers was, in all likelihood, 
Michigan’s last game at Yost 
this season — only a Wolverine 
win in Columbus, coupled with 
a Penn State victory over Notre 
Dame in the other semifinal, 
would change that. However, 
there was no official tribute, no 
large-scale displays of gratitude, 
no post-game tears at center-
ice — after all, you can only say 
goodbye so many times before its 
significance is diluted.

Instead, 
this 
weekend’s 

series felt like an encore from 
Michigan’s seniors — a show 
of thanks to their fans, their 
program and their university, 
giving them one final moment to 
remember them by.

Calderone and Dancs, first-

line 
mainstays 
all 
season, 

scored 
the 
game-winning 

goals on Friday and Saturday, 
respectively, and led the way 
with six of the Wolverines’ 13 
goals. Piazza and Porikos added 
crucial assists both nights as 
well.

“Really 
happy 
for 
our 

seniors,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “If this is our last 

game at Yost, which it might be, 
good way to go out.”

Calderone, 
in 
particular, 

saved his best for last. The 
Wolverines’ leading scorer found 
the net a career-high four times 
in Friday’s win, striking in every 
way possible.

A searing one-timer from 

junior forward Cooper Marody 
off an odd-man rush. A close-
range redirection of freshman 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes’ 

shot from the point into the 
net. Another one-timer off a 
gorgeous feed from Hughes. And 
to cap it off, a garbage goal after 
a rebound off the goaltender’s 
pads, giving Michigan a 6-5 lead 
that it would hold for the rest of 
the game.

“He’s a shooter, he’s a scorer,” 

Pearson said. “I’m so happy for 
him. You want your seniors to 
have your best year and he’s far 
exceeded my expectations. He’s 
not done and we’re not done.”

While Piazza and Porikos 

didn’t light the lamp themselves, 
they were integral in the buildup 

to 
two 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

prettiest goals not just of the 
weekend, but the entire season.

During a power play in Friday’s 

first period, Piazza received 
the puck on the left circle with 
no Badger in his vicinity. With 
oceans of space, 
Piazza 
sliced 

the 
Wisconsin 

penalty kill wide 
open, firing a pass 
across 
the 
slot 

to an open Jake 
Slaker 
for 
the 

game-tying goal.

A 
day 
later, 

Porikos 
won 

the 
puck 
after 

a 
neutral 
zone 

giveaway and burst down the left 
wing. Porikos, along with junior 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi, 

freshman forward Dakota Raabe 
and sophomore forward Adam 
Winborg, bore down on Badger 
defenseman Wyatt Kalynuk at 
full speed. The resulting “tic-
tac-toe” goal — Porikos-Cecconi-
Porikos-Raabe — belonged in the 

Louvre.

And then there was Dancs, 

the oft-overlooked member of 
the high-scoring “DMC” top 
line, with just 22 points on the 
season compared to Marody 
and Calderone’s 44 and 39, 

respectively.

No one would 

be able to ignore 
the 
North 

Vancouver, 
B.C. 
native’s 

presence 
on 

Saturday, 
however. 
He 

made that clear 
with a wrister 
from 
the 

high slot four 

minutes into the game to tie the 
score at one apiece. And another 
wrist shot on a two-on-one with 
just seven seconds remaining in 
the second period took Michigan 
to the intermission riding all the 
momentum.

Guess 
who 
assisted 
on 

both goals? None other than 
Calderone.

“It’s really special, obviously 

Tony’s night last night was 
incredible and he had another 
great 
night 
tonight,” 
Dancs 

said. “He’s been my best friend 
for four years now, and we’ve 
played together for pretty much 
our whole time here. So for him 
to get the assist on those goals, 
it’s pretty special and will be 
something to talk about for our 
whole lives.”

As the Wolverines’ seniors 

skated off the ice after the final 
horn, the poignant realization 
that they had likely done so for 
the last time had yet to hit home.

“Last weekend, senior night 

was sad, and this weekend was 
all business and stuff, try not to 
think about it, I’m sure,” Dancs 
said Saturday. “Tonight and 
tomorrow, the seniors will talk 
about it and it will kind of sink 
in, but we’re enjoying it right 
now.”

And courtesy of Michigan’s 

senior class, there’s a lot to enjoy.

It’s a group that has been 

through just about everything 

in four seasons. As role players 
just finding their way in college 
hockey, they came oh-so-close 
to 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament 

their freshman season, losing 
in the Big Ten Tournament 
championship to Minnesota. A 
year later, they would get their 
revenge on the Golden Gophers 
in the title game, helping the 
Wolverines return to the NCAA 
Tournament after a four-year 
drought.

As juniors, they endured the 

malaise of Michigan’s worst 
season in 30 years, despite 
playing more prominent roles 
than ever — Calderone led the 
team with 15 goals, while Piazza 
led all defensemen with 14 
points en route to being named 
the Wolverines’ only All-Big Ten 
honoree.

This season was supposed to 

be one of transition. With a first-
year head coach and young talent 
such Hughes, Slaker, Josh Norris 
and Will Lockwood continuing 
to 
grow 
and 
develop, 
the 

upperclassmen were expected 
to bridge the gap and impart 
their wisdom on the youthful 
Wolverines in hopes of building 
an eventual juggernaut under 
Pearson.

Instead, they took the reins, 

leading Michigan to 12 wins in 
its last 16 games and an all-but-
guaranteed NCAA Tournament 
bid.

“They’ve had some struggles 

here and they’ve had some good 
moments here also,” Pearson 
said. “Really happy for them. 
You need your seniors to be your 
leaders. … Those guys have really 
stepped up so good for them and 
good for us, we need them.”

The seniors’ time at Yost 

is probably over. But with a 
dominant performance in their 
final appearance, their legacy is 
secure.

Oh yeah, a second Big Ten 

championship — and maybe 
more — is still very much in play.

“It’s been an awesome ride 

here at Yost,” Dancs said. “Sad 
that it’s coming to an end, but … I 
love the team we have right now, 
we’re really hot, so we’re having 
a lot of fun right now and we’re 
going to try to keep going.”
