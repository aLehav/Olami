HEALTH CARE EFOR
US. House
passes health
care reform

Measure clears by
219-212 margin, with
34 Dems voting no
Staff and Wire Reports
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sum-
moned to success by President
Barack Obama, the Democratic-
controlled Congress approved his-
toric legislation Sunday night
extending health care to tens of mil-
lions of uninsured Americans and
cracking down on insurance com-

pany abuses, a climactic chapter in
the century-long quest for near uni-
versal coverage.
Widely viewed as dead two
months ago, the Senate-passed bill
cleared the House on a 219-212 vote.
Republicans were unanimous in
opposition, joined by 34 dissident
Democrats.
Obama watched the vote in the
White House's Roosevelt Room
with Vice President Joe Biden and
about 40 staff aides. When the long
sought 216th vote came in - the
magic number needed for passage

DETROIT -
Just over five months ago,
with the hockey season
about to get underway, I
sat directly across from Michigan
hockey captain Chris Summers, all
set to interview
him about
starting goalie
Bryan Hogan.
Hogan was "
the clear-cut
starter for the : -,
first time in
his career, and RYAN
for 10 minutes, KARTJE
I adamantly
prodded Sum-
mers to attest
to Hogan's job security.
But Summers wouldn't budge.
There was a walk-on goalie, stand-
ing at just 5-feet-7 inches (on a good
day) who Summers insisted was

challenging Hogan for his job every
day.
So I shrugged it off as captain-
speak and moved on. Shawn
Hunwick would see his time in
practice, he would be everyone's
favorite backup goalie and that was
it. Everyone loves the walk-on war-
rior. That was it.
If Bryan Hogan was out of
the lineup, the Wolverines were
doomed. I was sure of it.
And then against Notre Dame on
Feb. 25, with the season already in
turmoil, Hogan went for a kick save
and didn't get up.
It's over, I thought to myself
Hunwick skated apprehensively
onto the ice, and even he admitted
he was nervous. And who wouldn't
be? The walk-on had seen just
20 minutes of action - his entire
career.
So when Hunwick shut out the

FightingIrish in that first game, it
was a nice story - one of those that
made you feel warm inside.
Berenson, like myself, remained
skeptical.
"We're still not convinced
he's a starting goalie," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said after
the Wolverines' split with Notre
Dame. "He's been a backup that
really hasn't had the chance to be a
backup."
It was alreadythe Wolverines'
most disappointing season in
Berenson's 26-year tenure. The
fuzzy story was more like a band-
aid, tryingto keep the dam from
bursting.
Butthe band-aid, a tiny goalie
who joined the team just before
almost quitting the sport forever,
the afterthoughtwho found himself
winning impossible game after
impossible game for the Wolver-

ines, was still holding back the flood
as Michigan came to the Joe last
weekend.
Every scoring opportunity, I
found myself waiting for Hunwick
to prove my initial hesitation right.
He's going to give up a soft goal.
He's stilla backup. I couldn'thelp
but think it. Over and over.
I looked across the ice to the
other team's goalies in fear.
Cody Reichard, Miami's net-
minder, had justbeen named
CCHA Player of the Year. His 1.79
goals against average was second
best in the nation. He was the epito-
me of a brickwall.
He gave up five goals and was
benched.

the CCHA Championship, 25-year-
old Brian Stewart - the tallest
goalie in the CCHA - towered over

If passed by full
legislature, bill will
cut public university
funding by 3 percent
By VALIANT LOWITZ
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michigan and
other public colleges across the
state could be facing funding cuts
if a bill passed last week in the
Senate Appropriations Committee
makes its way through the Michi-
gan legislature.
A Republican-sponsored bill
passed in the state Senate Appro-
priations Committee Wednesday
aims to reduce Michigan's budget
deficit by cutting state aid to all
Michigan universities and commu-

nity colleges by 3.1 percent. This
would result in about $10.2 million
in lost state aid for the University
of Michigan in the next fiscal year.
If passed, the budget would go
into effect Oct. 1, 2010.
With state politicians des-
perately seeking ways to bring
Michigan's budget back into bal-
ance, some senators said they feel
that a cut in education funding is
unavoidable.
"We are in a box with our bud-
get, so we reduced it," State Sen.
Ron Jelinek (R-Three Oaks), chair
of the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, said in an interview. "We
have tried other government pro-
posed income revenue streams like
taxes, but that is something people
won't accept in this economy."

Arbor) said she recognizes the need

If elected president of the
Michigan Student Assembly,
Public Policy Rep. Ian Margolis
said his main goal would be to
produce tangible changes within
the assembly.
Margolis, a Rockville, Md.

pus Governance Committee, is
running as the presidential can-

Margolis said what sets him
apart from other candidates run-
ning for MSA president is his
commitment to encourage MSA
representatives to do more than
just be activists.
"It's important for the assem-

As part of her Michigan Stu-

paign promises, MSA Rackham
Rep. Kate Stenvig plans to lead
University students in rallies that
support increasing the diversity
of the student body.
Stenvig, who is from Royal
Oak, Mich., is running as the
presidential candidate for the
Defend Affirmative Action Party.
LSA freshman Sofia Bolanos is
running with Stenvig as DAAP's
vice presidential candidate.
This is the fourth time Sten-
vig - who has been a member
of MSA since 2004 - has cam-
paigned for MSA president. Sten-
vig's campaign initiatives include
gaining support for an increase
in minority enrollment at the

Margolis added that he wants
to address the "disconnect"
between the assembly and the
student body that has caused stu-
dents to remain in the dark about
what MSA is actually doing.
"There's a communications
breach between MSA and the
students," Margolis said. "MSA
hasn't done enough for students."

"We have been in a combined
crisis of the loss of affirmative

said.
Stenvig added that if elected,
she would encourage "a mass stu-

and stimulating an environment
that promotes diversity.

took part in an "Underground Undie
Run" on St. Patrick's Day, despite dis-
approval from the school's adminis-

March 19.
According to the article, the tra-
dition, which happens four times a
year, was canceled last Julybecause.
of safety concerns and attendance
by people unaffiliated with the uni-

Before the run, a police officer
forced about 15 students to put their
clothes back on and threatened to
have their diplomas held by the dean
of students if they did not leave, the
article reported.
Despite the police presence, stu-
dents decided to participate in the
run.

Unemployment
rates rise in most
Michigan regions
Unemployment rates rose in
January in 16 of Michigan's 17
major labor markets.
The state said Thursday that
seasonally unadjusted jobless
rates increased everywhere
except in the Lansing-East Lan-
sing area, where the rate was
unchanged.
The lowest jobless rate was 9.3
percent in the Ann Arbor region.
The highest was 20 percent in the
northeastern Lower Peninsula.
Significant increases in jobless
rates were recorded in all regions
from January 2009 to January
2010.
Regional unemployment rates
are not seasonally adjusted.
But national and state rates are
adjusted to remove seasonal
influences such as climate and
production cycles.

Obama promises
commitment to

President Barack Obama is

advocates that he is committed to
working with Congress on a com-

immigration system."
In a videotaped message pre-
sented on giant screens to thou-

Mall, Obama warned of the cost
of inaction. He said problems with
today's immigration systeminclude
families being torn apart, employ-
ers gaming the system and police
officers struggling to keep commu-
nities safe.
Obama said he would do every-
thing in his power to forge a bipar-
tisan consensus on immigration
reform this year.
Activists have been frustrated
about the pace of that reform.
Obama's taped comments were
released just as he worked to get

HEALTH CARE
From Page 1A
- the room burst into applause
and hugs. An exultant president
exchanged a high-five with his
chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.
A second, smaller measure -
making changes in the first - was
lined up for passage later in the eve-
ning. It would then go to the Senate,
where Democratic leaders said they
had the votes to pass it.
The nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office said the legislation
awaiting the president's approval
would extend coverage to 32 mil-
lion Americans who lack it, ban
insurers from denying coverage
on the basis of pre-existing medi-
cal conditions and cut deficits by
an estimated $138 billion over a
decade. If realized, the expansion
of coverage would include 95 per-
cent of all eligible individuals under
age 65.
In a statement released after the
vote, U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-

Mich.), who has proposed a health
care reform bill every year since
1957, praised the passing of the his-
toric vote.
"After generations of debate, we
have successfully addressed one of
the greatest moral and economic
problems of the day," Dingell wrote.
"What we have done tonight will
protect health care, as well as jobs
and our entire economy for genera-
tions of Americans."
Dingell wrote that millions of
Americans in danger of losing their
coverage will be able to "sleep eas-
ier" knowing that they will have
health coverage.
"The youngest Americans, and
the children born in the years to
come, will not have to live with the
fear that so many Americans have
had to live with in the past," Dingell
wrote. "I am proud of the courage
displayed by our colleagues today.
This is a great day for all of us, and I
believe that someday all Americans
will share thatview."
According to a Nov.15, 2009 arti-
cle in The Michigan Daily, 34,000

uninsured Michigan residents liv-
ing in the 15th congressional dis-
trict will receive health coverage as
a result of the new legislation. The
bill will also provide 160,000 fami-
lies in the district with health cov-
erage credits.
In the article, Dingell said he was
thrilled that Congress was finally
addressingthe health care issue.
"I feel very good," Dingell said
at the time. "I've worked on this for
53 years and, before me, my dad for
23 more ... and finally we got some-
thing through the House."
In a statement released last
night, State Rep. Mark Schauer (D-
Mich.), who voted in favor of the
health care bill, wrote that the leg-
islation will cut costs for Michigan
families and businesses.
"Despite a massive misinfor-
mation campaign paid for by the
health insurance industry, the
simple fact is that our health care
system is broken," Schauer wrote.
"Doing nothing would allow the
health insurance companies to
keep racking up massive profits at

the expense of Michigan families,
seniors and businesses, and ulti-
mately stifle our economic turn-
around.
For the first time, most Ameri-
cans would be required to pur-
chase insurance, and face penalties
if they refused. Much of the money
in the bill would be devoted to sub-
sidies to help families at incomes
of up to $88,000 a year pay their
premiums.
Far beyond the political ramifi-
cations - a concern the president
repeatedly insisted he paid no mind
- were the sweeping changes the
bill held in store for millions of indi-
viduals, the insurance companies
that would come under tougher
control and the health care provid-
ers, many of whom would face high-
er taxes.
The insurance industry, which
spent millions on advertising trying
to block the bill, would come under
new federal regulation. They would
be forbidden from placing lifetime
dollar limits on policies, from deny-
ing coverage to children because of

pre-existing conditions and fron
canceling policies when a policy-
holder becomes ill.
Parents would be able to keep
children up to age 26on their fam-
ily insurance plans, three years lon-
ger than is now the case.
A new high-risk pool would offer
coverage to uninsured people with
medical problems until 2014, when
the coverage expansion would go
into high gear.
The final obstacle to passage..
was cleared a few hours before the,
vote, when Obama and Democratic
leaders reached a compromise with-
anti-abortion lawmakers whose
rebellion had left the outcome in-
doubt. The president issued an,
executive order pledging that no
federal funds would be used for
elective abortion, satisfying Rep;.
Bart Stupak of Michigan and a
handful of like-minded lawmakers.

successful representative body. He
added that establishing better rela-
tionships between University stu-
dents, the administration and the
assembly would make MSA a more
"potent power."
With his two-year history as
chair of MSA's LGBT Commission,
Armstrong, a sociology concentra-
tor from Ridgefield, Conn., said he
knows how to use collaboration to
help specific communities grow.
"I have an experience of know-
ing how to build relationships
within (the LGBT) community and
organize that community to work
toward a goal," Armstrongsaid.
Armstrong said he wants to
"empower MSA with the little

to balance Michigan's budget, espe-
ciallyconsideringthenearly$1billion
budget deficit the state government
is facing. But she added that cuts to
funding for higher education aren't
the best way to balance the budget
and could be potentially detrimental
to the future of Michigan's economy.
"It's a 3-percent cut for all uni-
versities and colleges in the state
including the University of Michi-
gan, which is an unacceptable level
of cuts," Brater said. "It's the wrong
direction to be goingif we want to
diversify our economy. We have to
put more moneyin higher education,
notless."
However, Jelinek said the cuts in
aid were minimal in the greater con-
text of the state's budget.
"Education is a priority, and the
cuts we made have been quite small
in comparison to other cuts," he said.
Included in the bill is a provision,

things" that would help build the
campus community into a more
proactive student body. He cited
changes like wireless Internet in the
Diag, an easier application process
for intramural sports teams and a
Saturday night meal option with
Residential Dining Services.
Armstrong and Raymond are also
working together to combat big-
ger problems on campus by making
issues relevant to a broader range of
students.
"If you build that sense of com-
munity, then one issue becomes
everyone's issue," Armstrong said.
The Good Samaritan Law is one
issue Armstrong and Raymond
will lobby for if they are elected.
This law, if passed in Lansing, will
prohibit University campus police
from issuing a Minor in Possession
to an intoxicated student who calls
gram, that would restore $31 million
in tuition grants to students attend-
ing private colleges in Michigan.
"Basically the bill puts about $30
million back in that budget and cuts
a total of $42 million from the
public colleges and universities,"
Brater said. "So basically they'll
transfer money out of the public
colleges and universities to the
private."
But according to Jelinek, "that is
the only support we give to private
colleges."
The bill will go to the Senate
floor this week and, if passed, will
move onto the House.
Brater said she thinks the bill
willpassintheSenatebutisunsure
if it will pass inthe House.
"The Republicans that con-
trol the committee also control
the Senate floor, so they'll have a-
majority to pass it, but it has to go
through both houses so we'll have
some negotiation," she said.
For now though, Michigan's
public universities are preparing
for cuts in aid and are planning

an ambulance for an intoxicated
friend.
"That is one of the biggest things
on campus that prevents students
from taking their friends in," Arm-
strongsaid.
Armstrong said his activism
started during his freshman year
when he attempted to bring the
Midwest Bisexual, Lesbian, Gay,
Transgender, Ally College Confer-
ence - a conference where LGBTA
student leaders from across the
Midwest come together to pro-
mote dialogue and mobilize stu-
dents to action - to the University.
Armstrong said the project failed
because of the lack of communica-
tion among students.
He said that even after things
didn't work out, he rallied again
for the conference and succeeded
in getting it to come to campus the
accordingly.
Cynthia Wilbanks, University
vice president for Government Rela-
tions, said the University has been
fighting hard to reduce the cuts and

next year.
"That's really important because
students deserve to see someone
that isn't going to give up after one
hiccup," he said.
Throughout the year, Armstrong
has advocated for University Hous-
ing to adopt a gender-neutral hous-
ing option. He said that by bringing
the gender-neutral housing issue
"into the forefront of campus," he
has tried to make students under-
stand that gender-neutral housing
is relevant to everyone, and not just
one group of students.
Armstrong said awareness of stu-
dent issues would move MSA for-
ward to solve student concerns. He
added that pushing MSA advocacy
with more force would make MSA
more relevant in the minds of stu-
dents.
Armstrong said he also wants
maintain the level of aid that the
University currently receives from
the state.
"We have testified in front of the
Senate about the need for funds,"

to encourage MSA to get involved-
with issues that have an impact
beyond campus. For example, Arm-
strong said he wants to work with
the Michigan Legislature and Ann.
Arbor City Council on issues that
make students feel "complacent,"
especially when it comes to tuition
increases.
"A lot of students are being forced-
to reconsider every year becausl1
they can't afford beinghere, which is
something I do not feel comfortable
with," he said.
Armstrong said his passion and
determination would help him tj:
make the issues he tackles on MSA
relevant to all students.
"I really have' a certain sense of
purpose and drive towards voicing
student concerns on this campus
and pushing for a broader sense of
community," he said.
she said. "We need the investment -
in higher education for the economid
future of the state and for our ability
to provide a high-quality education!
for our students."

Keeping the war close to home

Back to the draing ar
City Council should repeal anti-graffiti ordinance
f you've been noticing less graffiti colorfully sprayed on Ann
Arbor buildings lately, it's because the Ann Arbor City Council
has taken it upon itself to force local business owners to clean
it up. City Council passed an ordinance last year in an effort to keep
Ann Arbor businesses clean of graffiti. Instead, it wrongly punish-
es property owners by making them pay for the removal someone
else's graffiti. The future of the city's anti-graffiti ordinance will
be uncertain as the city council reviews the policy in the coming
months. Because this ordinance unfairly punishes business owners
and could damage the city's urban character, City Council must take
the upcoming opportunity to repeal it.

This weekend, the seven-year
anniversary of the start of
the Iraq War passed with-
out fanfare. U.S.
involvement in
Afghanistan will
reach its ninth
birthday this
fall. The reces-
sion has causeda
the wars to fadea
from our national
consciousness.
But they're still PATRICK
out there. They O'MAHEN
have ramifica-
tions for millions
of people in Iraq
and Afghanistan, as well as for U.S.
troops - many of whom are ourclass-
mates.
As we go about our everyday busi-
ness here in Ann Arbor, it would do
us well to remember these stakes in
human life. I needed a stark reminder
of this and got one last November.
I was working in my office when a
knock on the door brought a distant
war to my doorstep.
I answered it, and found a tall,
well-built man standing there. He
had a military bearing and looked
vaguely familiar.
"Hi, I don't know if you remember
me, but ... " And then I remembered
him. His name was Oliver. He had
been in a section I taught on contem-
porary issues in American politics in
2007. He was in ROTC at the time and
brought serious gravity to the discus-
sions the class had on U.S. Iraqpolicy.
He had thought he would be going
to Iraq when he graduated. He'd
impressed me with his honesty and
intellectual rigor during discussion.
Recognizing that your life, your fel-
low soldiers' lives and the lives of the
civilians you interact with depend
on getting things right does tend to
influence one's thoughts. He gradu-
ated in 2009 and shipped off to Fort

Sill in Oklahoma to learn the fine art
of using 155 mm field howitzers.
Then, shifting foreign policy
emphasis sped up a withdrawal from
Iraq and increased troop levels in
Afghanistan. Care to guess where
Oliver is going later this spring?
"I spent all that time learning about
Iraq in college, and now I'm going to
Afghanistan," he chuckled dryly.
He came to ask for help. "I don't
know much about Afghanistan," he
said, adding that he was looking for
scholarly work on Central Asia so he
would be prepared for the culture
he was going to face on the ground
and more aware of Afghanistan's
history and politics. He told me that
his comrades at Fort Sill had a much
higher aptitude for the mathemati-
cal aspects of artillery than he did,
but he figured as a political science
graduate, he could provide the unit
with useful knowledge of the politi-
cal context.
I was flattered. A former student
respected me enough to return to me
and seek my counsel ina serious situ-
ation. The only problem was that I
didn't know anything about Afghani-
stan either. That's when the weight of
the world deposited itself squarely on
my shoulders.
Fortunately, being a graduate stu-
dent means that I know people who
have more information than me in
a variety of topics. One of my col-
leagues, Megan Reif, happens to
know a lot about democratization,
elections and violence in Central
Asia and has traveled extensively in
Afghanistan and Pakistan. I intro-
duced Oliver to her, and she gave him
some authors and her e-mail address.
I think (I hope) that it was useful.
But I still worry about Oliver.
I'm a politically active person. I'm
so interested in politics and public
policy that I study them for a living.
But there are only so many things I
can pay attention to. I study media
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

and public opinion. I'm an educator
and a union member, so I have a deep
interest in education and labor issues.
And, based on some of my own wor-
ries about insurance, the fact that my
mother and girlfriend work as a nurse
and doctor and having seen some of
my own students with serious chronic
health problems, I have spent a lot of
time reading about health care reform.
Remember the
stakes in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
In contrast, Afghanistan is far
away from me geographically, emo-
tionally and intellectually. Although
I study political science and know
plenty about elections and democra-
tization, I don't specialize in security
studies, civil wars or international
relations. Nor do I know much about
Central Asia, beyond the limited
amount of information I glean from
the news or in conversation with col-
leagues like Megan.
But with Oliver's visit last Novem-
ber, Afghanistan became just a little
bit more personal for me. That's prob-
ably a good thing. Wars have conse-
quences, so it's useful for all of us to
have some personal skin in the game
- whether in increased tax dollars,
ourselves or family and friends who
might be in harm's way - to focus our
thoughts on their importance.
Oliver, take care of your command,
help as many Afghanis as possible, do
the best job you can in a messy situ-
ation and please come home in one
piece.

The anti-graffiti ordinance was passed
by City Council in January of 2009 and
went into effect in May. The ordinance
calls for Ann Arbor property owners to
remove graffiti from their facilities using
their own time and resources. After receiv-
ing notification from the city, business
owners are required to remove the graf-
fiti from their property within nine days.
Property owners who fail to comply with
the city's request in the designated time
are required to pay for the city to remove
the graffiti. A report on the effectiveness
of the ordinance will be available in the
coming months, at which point City Coun-
cil will review the policy to determine its
effectiveness.
The anti-graffiti ordinance's enforce-
ment is irrational - it punishes property
owners for something they didn't do. Prop-
erty owners shouldn't be held accountable
for the fact that their property has been
tagged with graffiti. Yet, this ordinance
treats them like they were holding the can
of spray-paint. If the city considers graffiti
a form of vandalism, then this ordinance
punishes the victims of a crime. Property
owners shouldn't have to pay to remove
graffiti they didn't create.
In fact, City Council shouldn't force any-
one to get rid of graffiti if they don't want

to. Graffiti shouldn't have to be removed
just because the city has labeled it as
unsightly. For many, graffiti is a unique
form of urban art that adds to Ann Arbor's
modern character. Graffiti is part of the
urban landscape and residents shouldn't
have to remove it if they find the art attrac-
tive. This is exemplified in Graffiti Alley,
located on East Liberty Street next to The
Michigan Theater, which is an enormous
collection of graffiti artwork. Even Ann
Arbor councilmembers have recognized
Graffiti Alley as a landmark. But graffiti
can be art no matter where it's tagged, and
property owners shouldn't have to scrub it
away if they deem it art on the same level
as the graffiti in Graffiti Alley.
And this ordinance is unnecessary
because, contrary to the perception of
City Council, graffiti isn't an overwhelm-
ing concern in Ann Arbor. Occurrences of
graffiti in the city are limited and usually
confined to areas like Graffiti Alley. The
ordinance makes it seem like Ann Arbor
is coated in layers of spray-paint - but it's
not.
The anti-graffiti ordinance wastes prop-
erty owners' time and money to solve a
problem that doesn't exist. Graffiti isn't a
mess - it's art. City Council should realize
this, and stop its antagonism of expression.

MSA reps are working for
Sat. night dining hall option
TO THE DAILY:
The two of us can't wait for Tuesday. Why,
one might ask? Is there a two-hour special of
"American Idol"? What is so significant about
Tuesday, Mar. 23?
Students have long been asking for Saturday
night dining. Thankfully, MSA is already work-
ing on this issue. We have made great strides
to set up a meeting about Saturday Night Din-
ing with Director of University Housing Linda
Newman and Residential Dining Services
Director Mike Lee this Tuesday, Mar. 23.
Over the course of the winter semester, we
have been working long and hard as MSA rep-
resentatives to draft a formal proposal advo-
cating for the implementation of Saturday
night dining. The proposal includes favorable
results from a survey conducted by Elias Samu-
els of the Housing Research Office last winter,
resolutions passed in support of Saturday night
dining by the Michigan Student Assembly and

the Residence Hall Association and detailed
research on Saturday night dining offerings
at comparable universities (Michigan State
University and Ohio State University have Sat-
urday night dining and the University of Mich-
igan does not).
With all the work we have put in, it's obvious
why we are disappointed that with an article in
the Daily last week that failed to reference our
ongoing efforts (MForward looks to revive push
for Sat, night dining, 03/18/2010). It's great that
MForward provided a free meal to students in
the residence halls on a single Saturday night.
However, ourwork will havea much more sub-
stantial and long-term impact.
While MForward hasn't even left the start
line on the issue of Saturday night dining, the
two of us are rounding the bend and sprinting
towards the finish line. Rather than discount-
ing our work and starting from scratch, we
invite MForward and anyone else interested to
support our efforts for Saturday night dining to
the meeting on Tuesday.

Hardly a week goes by without
at least one person asking me
why I chose to leave sunny
Florida for gray,
cold and snowy
Michigan. I typi-
cally go through a
long list of reasons
- I hated the hot
weather, alliga- I
tors are scary, no 4
one has any ambi- . ;
tion, there are
giant pictures of ALEX
fetuses on the side SCEiFF
of the highway and
intolerant reli-
gious zealots hold
way too much influence in the state's
government and society at large. I
finally stumbled upon an article in
The Palm Beach Post to which I can
direct people when they ask me why
I came here. Summarizing my frus-
tration with Florida in one headline,
it is entitled, "Florida bill to reward
'family-friendly' films is derided as
1950s-style moral censorship."
According to Florida law, "family-
friendly" films are currently eligible
to receive a tax credit worth two
percent of their production costs.
The incentive program is designed
to bring filmmakers to the state and
create jobs all the while promoting
a "wholesome" society. Florida state
Rep. Stephen Precourt (R-Orlando)
- whose district includes Walt Dis-
ney World - is leading the push to
expand the credit to five percent
and exclude productions that exhibit
"nontraditional family values." Ques-
tioned about his motives, Precourt
said, "think of it as like Mayberry,"
referring to the fictional setting
"The Andy Griffith Show" in which
minorities were seen, not heard - if
they were even portrayed at all - and
all women embodied stereotypical
homemaker roles.
The broader point of the tax credit
is to portray "nontraditional" fam-
ily values - any family without one
mother and one father - as some

sort of immoral affront to society
that must be excluded from the ben-
efits that "traditional" families are
entitled to. This is, at its core, just
another attempt by the religious right
to engineer society according to its
own moral sentiments. To put this in
perspective, the movie "Confessions
of a Shopaholic" was deemed too vio-
lent for the "family-friendly" credit
because two women fought over a
pair of shoes.
Discrimination, as you all know,
isn't limited to the South. People who
don't uphold the "traditional val-
ues" are treated as less than human
by society's self-appointed morality
police, who hold a disproportionate
influence over government policy.
Last semester, I wrote a viewpoint
for the Daily as an open letter to the
president of the American Family
Association of Michigan, Gary Glenn.
(AFA has extreme views onfamily val-
ues, 10/27/2009) I responded to his
assertion that the Daily's editorial
staff was "so far left and so intracta-
bly intolerant of those with a diver-
sity of opinion on this issue that they
really do think anyone who dares
disagree with them... really are just
a bunch of hatemongers." This is an
organization that boycotted Disney
because it provided health care for
gay employees' partners and that
encourages members to shop only at
stores that say "Merry Christmas"
and not those that say "Happy Holi-
days." An organization "so intracta-
bly intolerant" exists in this state and
it, along with its "pro-family" allies,
have been influential in upholding
- and extending - the institutional
discrimination consistently faced by
members of the LGBT community
across the country.
Some of these groups' antics border
so closely to the insane that they even
appear comical at times. But discrimi-
nation must be eliminated - and there
is no shortage of it to be rooted out. The
most egregious example is the Mar-
riage Protection Amendment tacked
on to Michigan's constitution in 2004.

This barred same-sex couples from the
1,138 rights, privileges and benefits of
marriage, according to a 2004 report
by the U.S. Government Accountabil-
ity Office. The amendment has engen-
dered several problems stemmingfrom
the lack of legal structure that comes
with marriage. For example, when two
partners raisea child together, there is
no recourse for the non-biological par-
ent to assert custody even if he or she
played an equal role in the child's life
since his or her birth. This was exactly
what happened to Michigan's own
Renee Harmon, who must now go to
court to fight for the right to see the
children she had raised for a decade.
Tax policies
shouldn't aid
discrimination.
It doesn't stop there. Discrimina-
tionagainstgay peopleis soengrained
that they are prevented from openly
serving in the armed forces to pro-
tect a country that actively denies
them equal treatment. And yet, still
many serve, hiding their sexual ori-
entations from those around them to
protect those who call their lifestyle
immoral and wrong.
Tax policies shouldn't be used as
an arm of the "pro-family" movement
to indoctrinate children via films
and re-engineer our culture based
on its concept of "traditional" values.
Instead of accepting the treatment of
members of the LBGT community as
second-class citizens, it is imperative
that we shun arbitrary definitions of
"traditional" and "pro-family" values
and see them for what they are: dis-
crimination in disguise.

Who really writes songs?

"Be vewy vewy quiet. Im hunting Wattatas,
Matt Damon gets chaotic

There's something about the
term "songwriting" that
has always remained a bit
enigmatic to me. Just what exactly
constitutes a
good songwrit-
er? Where does
"songwriting"
end and "music" c
begin- or is
there essen-
tially no legroom
between these-
two concepts? JOSH
Can an album BAYER
sound like a
dream and still
be a piss-poor example of good
songwriting? These are just some
of the things I wonder when I'm in
bed practicing my neuroticism.
Perhaps the inclusion of the
root "songwriting" in the elusive
"singer-songwriter" term can shed
some light on the matter. When one
hears the word "songwriter," it's
tough not to imagine the prototypi-
cal image of a lyricist strumming an
acoustic guitar and singing along
poetically. Thus, it seems safe to
conclude that original, colorful lyr-
ics are a cornerstone when it comes
to good songwriting.
But what about Elton John?
While the Rocket Man certainly
seems to be suspended in the eye
of pop culture history as one of the
greatest songwriters of the past
few decades, the fact stands that
he didn't write the lyrics to the,
vast majority of his songs. Bernie
Taupin was the man behind the
curtain, feeding John lyrics that he
subsequently put to music.
So how much of a blow does
this deliver to John's legacy as a
songwriter? If you see songwrit-
ing as primarily a form of personal
expression, it certainly seems like
John would lose a few points here
- how strong of a personal connec-
tion can you have with your music
if the content essentially belongs to
someone else? But if you hedge your
vote on pure pop genius and chest-
clearing, honeybun melodies, John
is right there at the top.

'Green Zone' can't match the
Iraq War-movie grandeur of
Oscar-winning
'The Hurt Locker'
By HANS YADAV
Daily Arts Writer
In the wake of the "Hurt Locker" tsunami
that recently swept this year's Academy Awards,
it's difficult not to compare the
breakthrough film to war mov-
ies released since then. Enter
"Green Zone," an eager con- Green Zone
tender stepping into the Iraq
War arena. In contrast to the At Quality 16
unnerving tranquility of war- and Showcase
ravaged Iraq "Locker" portrays, Universal
"Zone" depicts a different side,
full of chaos and deception. But
apparently that chaos is contagious, as "Zone"
falls apart quickly despite its thrilling qualities.

The film begins with a flash of light and an
explosion. Pandemonium descends upon an Iraqi
household as men and women rush to safety.
Director Paul Greengrass wastes no time getting
the action started and the adrenaline pumping.
The scene then switches to Chief Warrant
Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon, "Invictus") as
he leads his troops under sniper fire to an aban-
doned warehouse in the middle of Baghdad. The
city has spiraled into anarchy as looters and
raiders storm the streets. Heeding the civilians
while still making their way inside, the Ameri-
can troops eventually secure the building, only to
discover something ugly. The warehouse is com-
pletely empty.
"Zone" is about the investigation of the
rumored weapons of mass destruction program
in Iraq. Despite a seemingly dry subject material,
Greengrass proves he can still maintain the same
level of suspense and thrill his "Bourne" movies
are famous for. Fans may rejoice upon seeing the
familiar use of the first-person, shaky camera.
This technique helps to create the fast-paced,
engaging momentum of the movie.

Margolis cited events organized
by MVP leaders like the formation
of the "Block M" during Michigan
football games, promoting Go Blue,
Beat OSU Week, providing coffee
and bagels to students on the Diag
as part of MSA Mondays and hosting
the upcoming "AA Chillin" spring
concert featuring artists Wale,
Clipse and Big Sean.
As part of his campaign goals,
Margolis said that he wants to bring
more events to campus, like those
he's worked on in the past, in order
to make the students' time at the
University more memorable.
"Every day and every night we
need to be working on improving the

According to Stenvig, the increase
in students seeking help from Coun-
seling and-Psychological Services at
the University is a testament to the
pressure and stress students are feel-
ingfromthecampusenvironment.
"The drop in minority enrollment
means that there is an increase in
racism and sexual assault and gen-
eral expressions of sexism," she said.
According to a petition drafted by
DAAP and the Coalition to Defend
Affirmative Action by Any Means
Necessary - known as BAMN - to
reverse the drop in minority student
enrollment at the University, from
2005 to 2009 the number of black
students in the freshmen classes fell
from 443 to 290. In the same time,
period the number of Latino stu-

including myself, said it wouldnever
happen.
Three and a half seconds
remained on the clock Saturday and
the Wolverinesstill led. The faceoff
was at the other end. It was over.
So Hunwick, with the weight of
college hockey's most illustrious
program on his narrow shoulders,
kickedback.
Arms laid atop the crossbar, Hun-
wick watched as his team won the
CCHA Championship in the most
improbable way. But he was used to
improbable at this point.
Hunwick could only watch as his
incredible story reached its climax.
"I got pretty emotional," Hunwick
said after the game. "I saw everyone
hanging over the boards, Iknew they

were coming to get me. I was just try-
ing to keep it together."
But the walk-on was used to keep-
ing it all together - he'd been keeping
Michigan together for weeks now.
And as he received honors as
CCHA Tournament MVP, he was the
only doubter left in the building.
"I don't even know if I deserve
to be MVP," Hunwick said. "I don't
even know if I deserve tobe the
starter of the game ... Six weeks ago
if you would have said I'd be sitting
here, I would have said you were
crazy."
And so wouldI. But as the Wol-
verines roll into their NCAA first
round matchup against Bemidji
State next weekend, they come inas
the hottest team in the nation. With

Hunwick, the walk-on warrior, the
nation's hottest goalie.
It's a story that seems too far-
fetched to believe. But there's no
ignoring it anymore. None of us
saw Shawn Hunwick, but he was
there all along. Just waiting for his
shot.

"I don't think any of us thought
he could do it night after night,"
Berenson said. "But good for him.
You never know. That's one thing
I've learned as a coach, you never
know about a player, you never know
what's inside him, until he really gets
a chance."

Now, a walk-on, who should've
never been there, whose teammates
were maybe the only ones who
believed in him, is Michigan's best
shot at a national championship.

student experience," he said.
Margolis also said MSA needs to
be more "responsive" to students
after student government elections
end. To do this, he plans to offer more
"deliverables," which he said are stu-
dent resources, like Airbus and fund-
ing for student organizations.
"I want to oversee an assembly
that focuses on these deliverables to
students," Margolis said. "We need
to have tangible things so that stu-
dents that aren't familiar with MSA
know what they are getting back
from it."
Margolis also plans to start
"Vision projects," which he
describes as times when represen-
tatives would walk around campus
and ask students what they want
from MSA and what they think
could be changed.
"We need to continue seeing what
students' visions are and creating
resultsto go along with what they tell
us they want to see us doing," he said.
Margolis said though the cur-

rent executive board of MSA has
made internal improvements, he
and Stuckeyare stressing the impor-
tance of external reform in their
campaign.
Margolis added that he is excited
for proposed student constitution
changes, including the Students 4
Progressive Governance proposal,
which includes new regulations
like the ability to impeach an MSA
president. Margolis said, if elected,
he would like to oversee the imple-
mentation of the proposed constitu-
tion.
"We need to make a separation of
powers to make MSA more effective
for the students," Margolis said.
Margolis said the relationship
between University students and
the administration could also be
improved and his work on the Cam-
pus Governance Committee has
taught him the importance of stu-
dents having an "active voice" when
it comes to communicating with the
administration.

ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
You're in the mood to overhaul things
at home and make changes forshe bete.
In particular, these changes likely will
involve getting rid of what you don't
need. "Take the garbage out!"
TAURUS
(April 20 toMay 20)
Discussions with others, particularly
relatives and siblings, might get heated
today. Your knee-jerk reaction is to per-
suade others to agree with you. Is this
really necessary?
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
You feel very strongly about financial
matters today. This could pertain to how
to earn money, or you might be just as
obsessed about buying something.
(Lighten up.)
CANCER
(June 21to July 22)
You might be more emotional than
usual because the Moon is in your sign
today. Furthermore, it opposes big daddy
Pluto. Guard against jealousy today!
LOops.)
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Your peace of mind might be vaguely
disturbed today because something
behind the scenes is bothering you. It's
as if you're worried about something,
but you're not sure what. This will pass
very quickly.
VIRGO
(Aug. 2310o Sept. 22)
Heated exchanges with others, espe-
cially friends or people in groups, might
arise today. People are inclined to be
pushy with their opinions. (Just watch
from the sidelines.)
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
Avoid disputes with parents, bosses
and authority figures today. They could

quickly turn nasty. Feelings of envy and
jealousy are running strong.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Arguments about politics, religion and
racial issues, or something having In do
with publishing and travel, might arise
today. It's far better to steer clear of all
this! Stay mellow.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22to Dec. 21)
This is a poor day to discuss inheri-
lances, how In share something or how
to approach a problem with taxes and
death. People are too stuck in their
views.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
Jealousy with a partner or close friend
might make relationships a bit sticky
today. You could be doing a slow burn
about something. Try to relax.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Speak up about your ideas to introduce
reforms or to improve where you work.
You also might have ideas about how to
improve your own health!
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Participants in sports will be competi-
tive today. No question! Romantic part-
ners will be jealous of one another. No
question! Don't give in to these dark
feelings.
YOU BORN TODAY You like to
study people; in part this is because you
want answers to the big questions in life.
You ab shoulders aeit eallwalks of life,
and you wantlto make sense of itall. You
are fond of children, and you're also a
bit of a risk-taker. Your year ahead will
focus on partnerships and close friend-
ships. New relationships might begin!

dents decreased from 312 to 224 and
Native American students fell from
57 to 21.
The petition also states that the
University's Law School minority
enrollment dropped 31 percent from
2005 to 2009.
A leading member of BAMN,
Stenvig said MSA should lobby to
restore affirmative action.
"There are more students who
really want to fight to defend their
right tobe here and defend the acces-
sibility of the University," she said,
adding that MSA can "play a historic
role in defending education."
Stenvig said MSA representatives
must play a "central role" in defend-
ing public education and the rights
of women and minority students.
"We need a leadership on our stu-
dent government that is being really
bold and fighting to mobilize the sen-
timent of the majority of the campus

in defense of integration and defense
of affordable education for every stu-
dentin Michigan," Stenvigsaid.
Stenvig added that, if elected,
she plans to have a more open dis-
course to encourage greater student
involvement within MSA to counter
the "bureaucratic" and "elite" envi-
ronment surrounding MSA.
To increase discourse, Sten-
vig said she wants to extend the
time allotted to community speak-
ers during MSA's weekly meet-
ings. Currently, speakers are given
three minutes and must show their
MCards to speak.
Stenvig said she sees a promising
future for MSA, but that right now,
the student government is only add-
ing to the University's problems.
"MSA has got to be part of the
solution in solving the issue of cam-
pus climate," she said. "And right
now, they are the problem."

GREEN ZONE
From Page 5A
What ultimately kills "Zone,"
though, and sets it leagues apart
from "Locker," is the dispassion-
ate roles in which the actors find
themselves. Damon's character
is the prototypical soldier who
defies seniority in the ranks in
order to satiate inner curios-
ity. Greg Kinnear ("Little -Miss
Sunshine") is the cookie-cutter
bureaucrat who selfishly follows
his own agenda "for the good of
the country."
Such formulaic roles also riddle
multiple holes in what otherwise
could have been a candidate for
a strong war movie. There are

too many unanswered questions
by the end of the film. Who is to
blame for the war? Is it the stoic
soldier who blindly follows orders
without questioning the validity
of intelligence gathered? Is it the
man in Washington who deceives
everyone in order to gain what he
wants? "Zone" may even put off
some viewers with its dangerous
habit of dancing a little too close
to anti-American sentiment.
In the end, "Zone" is just
another action-packed war movie
that barely raises eyebrows. What
is most disheartening is that it
truly had a great deal of potential
to stand on a similar tier to "Lock-
er." It appears, however, that sub-
sequent war movies will still be
caught in the latter's shadow.

PANIC
From Page 5A
performed by auteurs Stmphane 0
Aubier and Vincent Patar, who
also wrote, directed and animat-
ed the film by hand.
Today is Horse's birthday, and
his absent-minded friends want
to get him a better present than
last year. That is established
within the film's first ten minutes,
maybe less. It's also the last time
that any semblance of linearity
can be discerned. After that, it's
an incomprehensible menagerie
of pig missiles, octopus drum-
mers and the act of playing cards
on a rock while plummeting to
the center of the earth.
Where the film objectively
dazzles is in its animation. Stop-
motion animation is difficult and
time-consuming, and though the
movement of the characters is
purposefully choppy and static,
some effects - like Horse, Cow-
boy and Indian swimming to an
upside-down underwater house
where a family of sea monkeys are
cooking waffles or Horse show-
ering and brushing his teeth on
a Rube Goldberg machine - are
remarkable visual achievements,
especially in this age of digital
everything. Eccentricities like
the green army men-style plat-
forms beneath the feet of Cowboy
and Indian that disappear when
they climb steps are easy to miss
but integral to the film's charm, if
it can even be called charm.
If you know someone who
has seen "A Town Called Panic,"
don't ask for a criticism. You
won't get any response except
shrugged shoulders and bugged
eyeballs, or maybe a slow, mellow
smile, depending on what your
friend is doing when you ask. If
you feel compelled to join him
for a toke or two, consider light-
ing up outside the Michigan The-
ater and then watching "A Town
Called Panic." It would be right
up your alley.

to make the charts
Whowould've thought that a
little musical written, produced,
directed and performed by stu-
dents in Studio One on North
Campus would ever be a national
sensation?
Nestled in between no. 10 "The
Phantom of the Opera" and no.
12 "Rock of Ages," the Basement
Arts musical "Me and My Dick"
is the first student production to
make the Top Cast Albums charts,
accordingto Billboard.
The musical, previewed by the
Daily in October, follows high
school student Joey Richter and
his penis, Dick, as they navigate
their way through high school
trying to lose Joey's virginity. The
first public showing of "Dick" was
through Basement Arts's 24-hour
theater. After polishing, the show
premiered at Studio One on Oct
30. It's available on YouTube with
nearly 200,000 views, and the
soundtrack can also be found on
iTunes.
"Me and My Dick" - with
music and lyrics by A.J. Holmes,
Carlos Valdes and Darren Criss,
and book by Brian Holden, Matt
Lang, Nick Lang and Eric Kahn
Gale - was created by the same
team behind last year's hit show
"A Very Potter Musical." And the
success of the creative team only
seems to be growing. Their latest
musical "A Very Potter Sequel"
will premiere on campus on May
14. In July, the cast and crew of "A
Very Potter Musical" will perform
the show at Infinitus, the Harry
Potter fan convention in Orlando,
Fla. The team is waiting to hear
from the New York Internation-
al Fringe Festival, where many
shows have gone on to receive a
Broadway run.
In an interview with Billboard,
A.J. Holmes said, "We can't
believe the company we're in. So
many of our classmates just could
not believe this news. Least of all
us. We do think the No. 12 (cast
album) must be very confused."

The Michigan hockey team lifts the Mason Cup as the CCHA Tournament champions. The Wolverines became the first-ever seven seed to win the tournament, and earned an NCAA Tournament bid with the victory.
RESURRECTED

'M' draws
Bemidji in
first round
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
DETROIT - The thousand-pound gorilla was
hoisted off the Michigan hockey team's back on
Saturday night and tossed aside. After the Wolver-
ines poured out of the bench to celebrate their 2-1
victory over Northern Michigan and consequent
CCHA championship, hoards of Michigan fans
stuck around to watch the unveiling of the cham-
pionship banner.
They certainly had something to celebrate as
the Wolverines extended their record NCAA Tour-
nament appearance streak to 20. And of all years,
this one seemed like it might be the year Michigan
would be left out of the 16-team field competing for
a NCAA championship. Instead, the win vaulted
the team to a first-round matchup with Bemidji
State.
It took six straight wins in the CCHA Tour-
nament for the berth to become a reality, after a
season during which the Wolverines never strung
together more than four victories. Saturday's win
epitomized the run - solid defensive hockey and
timely goals.
"There is not many teams that are going to push
you like those guys pushed us tonight," Northern
Michigan coach Walt Kyle said. "They are fast
and they came at us. I knew going into the year,
everyone knew, that they were going to be good.
For whatever reason, chemistry, injuries, etc., they
stumbled a little bit, but when they found it, they
found it."

Blue defies
odds to win
CCHA title

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
DETROIT - Three weeks ago, the Michigan
hockey team was standing at the foot of a moun-
tain and they couldn't see the peak.
After beating No. 2 Miami 5-2 in the CCHA
semifinals Friday and following it up with a 2-1
over No. 12 Northern Michigan in the champion-
ship game at Joe Louis Arena on Saturday, Michi-
gan had scaled the mountain and extended their
19-year NCAA tournament streak to20.
No. 17 Michigan started the journey as the sev-
enth seed in the CCHA Tournament and many had
dismissed the team's chances. A seven seed had
never won the CCHA Tournamentbefore.
Starting goalie Bryan Hogari went out with
a groin injury two games before the playoffs.
Junior Shawn Hunwick, who had played in just
two games his whole career up to that point, was
forced to step in.
If that wasn't enough, senior captain Chris
Summers went out with knee injury in Michigan's
first-round series.
But after two impressive wins, this weekend the
Wolverines stood at the top of the mountain, won-
dering how they got there.
"I don't know," junior Louie Caporusso said.
"Maybe it was just the commitment and playing
defensive, sound hockey. We had to play as a team.
I can'ttell you what it was; maybe it was the adver-
sity throughout the whole year. Finally, we just

Santander leads in record victory'

DETROIT - As the Michigan
defense held the puck against the
boards for the last 10 seconds of
the CCHA Championship, the crescendo
of the raucous celebration in the Upper
Bowl of Joe Louis Arena reached a fren-
zied level.
It wasn't so much
cheering. It felt like so
much more than the
millionth-or-so time I'
sang "The Victors" or
chanted "It's Great To
Be A Michigan Wol-
verine."
It was a release. ANDY
I've been to foot- REID
ball games at almost
every Big Ten sta-
dium, a slew of bowl games, last year's
NCAA basketball tournament and the
2008 Frozen Four. Nothing felt like this.
Because - unlike any other Michigan
sporting event in the last 50-odd years
- there was nothing to be taken for
granted. A win wasn't expected; in fact,
most Michigan fans (including myself,
for purposes of full disclosure) had
written off the hockey team as a major
disappointment.
Michigan fans' desperation for some-
thing - anything - good had reached
such sky-high levels before the occur-
ance at the Joe this weekend that, when
Michigan coach Red Berenson thanked
the fans during the team's on-ice cel-
ebration, it was almost enough to com-
pletely make up for the rest of the school
year's unfulfillment.
It was a giant "Whew" moment, one
that this fanbase has been waiting for
since the Notre Dame football game
back in the fall.
I hate to say this Michigan fans, but
as much as this major sports slump has
sucked, and as much as 2009-10 has
felt like The Year That The Michigan
Athletic Department Has Forgotten, it's
been a very, very good experience for
the maize-and-blue faithful in the long
run.
It doesn't feel like it right now, but I
promise it will be.
It'll be worth it when the football
team finally rights the ship.
It'll be worth it when the basketball
team finally finds a level of consistency.
And it was absolutely, 100 percent
worth it Saturday night, when the enor-

mous Michigan student contingent was
on the verge of tears in celebration.
First of all, this slump will help Mich-
igan fans - one of the most win-hungry
fanbases in the country - appreci-
ate wins a little more. The difference
between the amount of students that
came to the Joe this year for the CCHA
Finals compared to the last two years
was remarkable.
Hockey fans are some of the most
dedicated on campus, but even so,
there's only one reason for this drastic
change in attendance: With constant
winning comes complacent fans.
This win feels good because it was
unexpected. Even though Michigan had
the talent to win the CCHA Champi-
onship all season, finally seeing them
reach said potential was one of the best
sports experiences I've had as a student
at Michigan.
The word "arrogant" gets thrown out
a lot about the Michigan faithful. And to
some extent, I accept and embrace the
term. We, as fans, deserve to be cocky.
Michigan football and hockey are two
of the most storied programs in col-
lege athletics history. So, of course, we
should expect to win.
But with that expectation comes a
certain dullness with every victory. If
the Wolverines win, they were supposed
to. If they lose, it's a freaking travesty -
it's almost a lose-lose situation as a fan.
But now our fandom has been tested
- and tested and tested and tested. The
fair-weather ones are gone, and what's
left is a hardcore group, the most dedi-
cated Michigan fan base in recent mem-
ory. Like the Phoenix rising from the
ashes, what has risen from Michigan's
recent mediocrity are real, blue-blooded
fans.
I saw that last night, as completely ran-
dom strangers threw their arms around
each other in celebration - one that has
felt better than any other victory in a long
time.
And that's the reward for those Michi-
gan fans who have stuck around.
Future wins are going to feel just like
Saturday night. Special.

The No. 4 Michigan men's gymnastics
team set a school record and NCAA sea-
son best with 364.450 points on Saturday
as it cruised past rival No. 5 Ohio State on
Senior Night.
Leading the way for the Wolverines was
senior Mel Santander and juniors Chris
Cameron and Thomas Kelley. Santander,
in particular, was a bright spot, as he set
another school record with the highest all-
around score ever.
"It's my last meet here and I wanted to
do the best that I could," Santander said.
"I'm very satisfied that I did that."
Not only did Santanderbreak the school
record in the all-around, he also received
career-best scores on the pommel horse,
still rings, parallel bars and high bar.
His score of 90.650 is the second-highest
overall score of any collegiate gymnast
this season, only .25 points behind the
highest one.
Cameron placed first in the floor exer-
cise, tied for second on the still rings and
finished second on the parallel bars. Kel-
ley was the high bar champion and also

finished second in the all-around, behind
Santander.
Throughout the season, Michigan has
had trouhles puttinsg together a complete
performance. There have always been one
or two mistake-ridden rotations, but on
Saturday, that was not the case.
"Nobody was afraid of anything and
nobody was afraid of missing," Cameron
said. "Every single gymnast went up and
did the best they could do, No hand place-
ment was off and no set was off. Every-
thing was just on."
Michigan's total score of 364.450 is the
highest score of any collegiate team this
season and is 2.80 points higher than No. 1
Stanford, which held the previous highest
score in the NCAA.
Lastseason on Senior Night, the Wolver-
ines were defeated by Illinois by one point.
"I think (Senior Night) had a real posi-
tive effect this year," Michigan coach
Kurt Golder said. "Of course, last year we
lost Senior Night and maybe they remem-
bered losing last year and probably got a
little extra motivation from that as well."
Senior Torrance Laury ended his
career at Cliff Keen arena with a bang, on
his performance during the fifth rotation

on the parallel bars. A senior leader, but
never a major contributor to the team's
score in his career, he had a solid routine
and perfectly stuck his landing. His score
of 14.50 was a career best, and a great way
to finish.
"I think the whole team was very excit-
ed for Torrance Laury," Golder said. "He
always has trouble with the dismount for
his P Bar routine, and he stuck it cold. I
think the guys were extremely happy for
him."
In two weeks, Michigan will travel
to Columbus to compete in the Big Ten
Championships. They will then travel to
West Point, N.Y. on April 15, to conclude
their season at NCAAs. Though the Wol-
verines will be coming off their highest
score ever, they still think much can be
improved before the postseason kicks off.
"We can get better," Cameron said.
"It's not like we stuck everything, and it's
not like we didn't have falls. I mean, geez,
we just want to get better, and reach our
potential which is still above what we did
today. The thing I love is now we have
three contenders for all-around titles at
both Big Ten's and NCAA's. It's going to be
a fun next month, that's for sure."

Wolverines win pitchers' duel in extras

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Writer
Although the fourth-ranked Michigan
softball team's 13-game win streak came
to a close on Saturday, its season-opening
27-game road trip still culminated in a suc-
cessful 4-1 weekend at the Judi German
Classic in Fullerton, Calif.
The Wolverines (22-5) got to work early
on Thursday, as they downed No. 2 Arizona
in a 1-0 pitchers' duel that saw no runs on
the board until extra innings.
Junior pitcher Jordan Taylor and the
Michigan offense knew Thursday's game
would be the team's toughest test thus far.
They were facing off against Arizona's
prized freshman phenom Kenzie Fowler,
the 2008 and 2009 Gatorade National High
School Player of the Year. Fowler was pre-
viously undefeated with a 0.70 ERA, not to
mention a lineup behind her that has three
hitters with a .420-plus batting average (the
Wolverines don't have a single .400-plus
hitter).
But Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
wasn't particularly intimidated.
"We want our team to prepare the same
for every game because the game of softball

doesn't know whether you're playing Ari-
zona or whoever," Hutchins said. "We don't
play the opponent's name on their chest; we
come out and play at the same high level for
everyone."
Day two of the tournament saw an offen-
sive explosion, as the team scored a com-
bined 29 runs against UNLV and Utah.
The team needed everybit of run support
against UNLV that morning, as it squeaked
by in a 14-13 victory that was character-
ized by a slew of pitching miscues and
unearned runs. And though the Wolverines
took down the unranked Utes in a convinc-
ing 15-1 five-inning victory in game two, it
started in a similar manner - Taylor gave
up a leadoff walk, hit two batters and com-
mitted three illegal pitches before exiting in
the first inning.
The illegal pitches raised some eyebrows
on the Michigan bench. Taylor was called
for a crow-hop violation - the pitcher's back
foot must be kept on the ground - which
had yet to be called on her this season.
"It's being called on a lot of pitchers this
year who have never been called for it,"
Taylor said. "Apparently it's a big issue right
now in softball."
Hutchins isn'tparticularly worried about

the perceived adjustment in enforcement,
so long as Taylor focuses on the "one-pitch
softball" mindset that the Valencia, Calif.
native was taught when she arrived in Ann
Arbor two years ago.
"The only pitch in the game that mat-
ters is the one you're throwing right this
moment." Hutchins said. "Some people call
it 'being in the zone'. We call it 'being in the
moment.'"
But the philosophy didn't help Taylor on
Saturday morningeither, as she losther sec-
ond game of the season to No. 15 Texas 5-2.
She gave up four earned runs on five hits,
but she also walked five batters and tossed
nine illegal pitches.
Senior hurler Nikki Nemitz pitched a
much cleaner game against DePaul that
afternoon in a 3-1 victory in which she gave
up four hits and two walks en route to her
seventh win of the season.
Last season, a season in which the Wol-
verines fell a game short of a Women's Col-
lege World Series championship game, the
team was 20-9 before it came home to Ann
Arbor. The team returns to Alumni Field
this Wednesday afternoon for its 2010 home
opener with a winning percentage 12 points
above that mark.

'Wolverines shut
out Spartans, 7-0

March 22, 2010 - 3B
'M' sweeps Fordham, loses to Mets

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
Prior to this season, the highest
the Michigan women's tennis team
had ever been ranked was No. 16.
On March 9, program history
was made once again this year, as
the ITA rankings moved the Wol-
verines up to No. 6 - the highest in
program history. Despite moving
back down to No. 8 due to an idle
week, the Wolverines (11-3 overall,
1-0 Big Ten) took that ranking into
Big Ten play with a win against
in-state rival Michigan State (5-8
overall, 0-1 Big Ten) on Saturday.
Michigan dominated the courts,
winning all doubles and singles
matches and shutting out Michi-
gan State 7-0, even though the
team had not played a dual match
in over two weeks.
"We were a little rusty, starting
a little slow in doubles," said Mich-
igan coach Ronni Bernstein. "We'd
been off for a couple weeks, but it
was good to get back out there and
to obviously get a Big Ten win."
Michigan junior Denise Mure-
san and senior Tania Mahtani
clinched the point for the Wolver-
ines in doubles, putting them ahead
1-0 and helping the team earn their
eighth consecutive.doubles point.
In singles, the Wolverines
dominated, and didn't allow any
matches to be taken to third sets.
This included junior Kari Wig who

played her first dual match of the
season at No. 6 singles, defeating
Christine Milliken 6-1, 6-2.
"Kari got in the lineup today and
that was very cool for her," Bern-
stein said. "She played pretty well
and won decisively, and that was
good to see."
Michigan earned its first singles
point when 26th-ranked Muresan
won her ninth match of the season
at No. 1, easily defeating Michaela
Silesova 6-1, 6-1. After junior
Whitney Taney won next at No. 3,
Mahtani clinched the match for
the Wolverines at No. 5, defeating
Elena Ivanova, 6-0, 6-4.
It was a day of continuous win-
ning streaks for the Wolverines, as
this was Michigan's fifth consecu-
tive win, not having a lost a dual
match since Feb. 20 against Duke.
Freshman Mimi Nguyen and
Taney also each won their sixth
and fifth matches in a row, respec-
tively.
Since starting her career as the,
Michigan women's tennis coach in
2007, Bernstein is now 19-2 against
Big Ten opponents.
"We're happy where -we are,"
Berstein said, "But we need to take
one match at a time and get ready
for next weekend."
The Wolverines take on two Big
Ten opponents next weekend as
they travel to Iowa on Saturday
and Minnesota on Sunday to con-
tinue their conference play.

advantage.
The second game of the day
saw Michigan's best offensive per-
formance to date, but the bigger
story involved redshirt freshman
lefthander Bobby Brosnahan.
Brosnahan, who sat out all of
last season while recovering from
Tommy John surgery on his elbow,
started the game and collected his
first career victory. He went for a
career-long seven innings, shutting
out the Rams and allowing only
five hits.
"It was real exciting," Brosna'
han said. "I've been trying to get

but I finally got to get it. The whole

and I worked on ... throwing the
fastball low in the zone because the
only time you get in trouble is when
you get the ball up. Saturday, I was
able to keep the ball down, and we
got all our outs."
Friday's game was more diffi-
cult. Michigan found itself on the
wrong side of the scoreboard twice,
but battled back and took the lead
on both occasions, notching its first
comeback victory of the season
with its 8-6 result.
Sophomore designated hitter
Coley Crank led the charge, going
3-for-5 on the day with three RBI.
With his team down 5-4 in the bot-
tom of the seventh, Crank tripled
off of the right-field wall to drive in
two runners and retake the lead for
good. The Pinole, Calif. native fin-

ished a home run short of the cycle.
To close out the weekend, the
Wolverines took on the host New
York Mets in an exhibition event
that has become an annual affair.
The big-league team easily took
the 8-1 victory, but Maloney did
not approach the game as he would
any other. Instead, he tried to get
as many players as possible into
the game to provide them with the
experience of playing in a major
league game.
For collegiate athletes, it's a sur-
real experience to see players like
all-star David Wright trot out on
the field for the opposition.
"It's fun," senior first baseman
and captain Mike Dufek said. "We
want to come out and still play
good baseball, but we're not really
expecting a win or a loss-kind of
thing. We just wanna play well ...
and we are very thankful that the
Mets and (Michigan alumnus and
Mets owner Fred) Wilpon allow us
to do all that."
And after five weeks of exten-
sive, exhausting travel to open the
season, the Wolverines can now
look forward to their home opener
against IPFW at Ray Fisher Stadi-
um this Friday.
"I'm hoping that we'll play as
well as we did against Fordham
and hit on all cylinders in prepara-
tion for the Big Ten," Maloney said.
"We're hoping the weather holds
up, so we can play these games
because we gotta keep tryingto get
some momentum now."

Michigan falls short of
0 topping No. 1 Alabama

Blue's speed proves too much for NMU

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
In its final meet of the regular
season Friday, the No. 10 Michigan
women's gymnastics team found
plentytobesatisfied within its close
loss to top-ranked Alabama.
On the Crimson Tide's Senior
Night in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the Wol-
verines kept themselves within
striking distance all night long, fall-
ing by just a slim margin of 197.575-
196.875, which set a season-high
team score.
The only problem for Michigan
(4-1 Big Ten, 13-3 overall) was that
Alabama (9-2) also put up its top
marks of the season, tallying the top
score for any team in the NCAA this
year.
But despite the defeat, the overall
team score boosted spirits enough
to appreciate the outcome.
"We're happy to come away with
that score, and we are very pleased
with how we performed," Michi-
gan coach Bev Plocki said. "We're
steadily climbing and getting ready
for next week and the beginning of
the postseason."
With the Big Ten Championships
next Saturday, the team is peak-
ing at just the right time. The most
encouraging aspect of the evening
was the Wolverines' abilityto regain
stability on the balance beam where
they struggled much of the season.
Although the beam rotation was
the team's biggest worry at the
beginning of the season, senior cap-
tain Kelsey Knutson hasn't faltered
as of late, taking home the ninth
title of her career with a career-
best 9.950 performance against the
Crimson Tide.
"That was just icing on the cake,"
Knutson said. This was by far the
best gymnastics meet of my life, and
it was just a lot of fun to go out there
and put it all together."
NCAAS
From Page 1B
Kelly, Michigan's most versatile
swimmer, earned All-American
distinctions in both the 200-yard
individual medley and 100-yard
butterfly, placing sixth in both
races. Her performance in the 100-
yard butterfly is the fastest ever in
the Big Ten in a legal swim suit. She
also helped the 400 and 800-yard
freestyle relays finish in 11th place,
good for honorable mention All-
American honors.
"It's hard to come back after we
tapered for Big Tens," Kelly said.
"It's kind of a hard to comeback and
perform just as well as we did there.
I think everyone did a good job."
The two represent opposite
paths in their journey to donning
a Michigan swim cap. Kelly was a
standout swimmer fromAnn Arbor
Pioneer High School and arguably
one of the best recruits in program
history. She was a seven-time All-
American swimmer during her
senior year of high school, and she
helped Pioneer to four state cham-

But just as Knutson's high scores
no longer come as a surprise, junior
Kylee Botterman's numbers were
just as outstanding as they have
been all season.
Botterman put up an all-around
score of 39.550 to steal the crown
fromAlabama's Morgan Dennis and
Ashley Priess, and won the vault
with a nearly perfect score of 9.950.
"To go out and winthe all-around
against the top-ranked team in the
nation is a pretty big accomplish-
ment," Plocki said. "Kylee had a
great meet and had an absolutely
outstandingvault. one of the judges
even gave her a 10.0 on vault."
Aside from the individual per-
formances, Plocki had a few words
to say about the meet's judging, say-
ing that the scoring seemed slightly
biased, and with the Big Ten Cham-
pionships looming, she hopes that
the judging from now on will be a
non-factor.
"It was Alabama's Senior Night,
so the judging was pretty generous
for some of their routines," Plocki
said. "They are a very, very good
team, but I thought that the team
score should have been a little bit
closer. I hope that in postseason
competition in a neutral atmosphere
we would give them a little more of a
run for their money."
As the Wolverines approach next
Saturday's six-team matchup in
Columbus, they will try to contend
for their fourth-straight conference
championship by putting up equally
impressive totals.
"When we go up against the top
teams, the difference is that they
are sticking their landings, and we
can improve on that," Plocki said. "I
justwantto go in there and have the
same kind of meet, the same kind
of energy and focus that we had (on
Friday), and if we do that then we
should fare very well in the postsea-
son."
pionships.
Brunemann, on the other hand,
was not a "blue chip" recruit as
Richardson describes from Cres-
cent Springs, Kentucky. Despite
not being highly touted coming in,
it didn't take long for Brunemann
to find her stroke.
As a freshman she placed fourth
and fifth place in the 1,650-yard
freestyle and 400-yard individual
medley, respectively, at the Big Ten
meet.
"I never thought coming in that
I would have done as much as I've
done in college," Brunemann said.
"I can't walk away with any disap-
pointment because ... throughout
my five years here and I've exceed-
ed expectations that I've had of
myself."
Although their careers are com-
plete at the university, there's no
question that the two have secured
their legacy as some of the best
swimmers in program history.
"You know when you put them
in a race it's going to take probably

From Page 1B
On Saturday, the Wolverines
(25-17-1) took a 1-0 lead into the
final period. They had 20 minutes
to extend to their streak to 20
years. As those minutes dwindled
down to mere seconds, Michigan
still clung to a one goal lead, this
time by the score of 2-1.
Caporusso, the face of Michi-
gan's second-half resurgence, had
the game-winner on the power
play. He wheeled out of the cor-
ner, received a pass from senior
defenseman Steve Kampfer and
directed it on goal to score his
second of the game.
The Wildcats spent the third
trying to get back into the game
after Caporusso's second goal.
But their final chance was sent
TOURNEY
From Page lB
Junior forward Louie Capo-
russo, who scored both goals on
Saturday, said Michigan has been
playing its best hockey of the sea-
son. Michigan cruised through
the CCHA Tournament, scoring
28 goals in six games to its oppo-
nents' nine.
With the Wolverines winning
the CCHA's automatic qualifier
for the tournament, Michigan
(14-13-1 CCHA, 25-17-1 overall)
now has appeared in the NCAA
Tournament a record 33 times.
The momentum from the confer-
ence tournament run could be a
big factor in helping the Wolver-
ines advance in the tournament if
they can continue their high level
of play.
"We realized that we were a
team that could go places (after
the last reguir season series),"

wide to the right of Hunwick, and
with 3.5 seconds left in the game,
Northern took a penalty to stop
the clock. Michigan didn't wait
for the final seconds to tick down
to mob Hunwick.
. As soon as the puck was
dropped, the bench emptied and
gloves and sticks lay scattered all
over the ice as Hunwick disap-
peared in the huddle of blue jer-
seys.
It was a fitting end for the
goalie who was anonymous to the
masses for most of his career thus
far.
Hunwick's biggest contribution
came against the CCHA's leading
scorer, Northern's Mark Olver, in
the second period. Olver walked
into the slot and let go of a wrist
shot, only to have Hunwick reach
out with his glove to get a piece
on it. Hunwick's 17-save effort
was rewarded after the game, as
senior defenseman Steve Kampfer
said. "When we started the CCHA
Tournament, no one expected us
to do well. We came out in those
first two playoff series as a team
that nobody wanted to play. That's
what we're going to keep doing."
Michigan found out Sunday
morning that it will be the No. 3
seed in the Midwest Region and
will take on the No. 2 seed Bemi-
dji St. in Fort Wayne, Ind. in the
first round. The No. 1 seed in the
region is Miami (Ohio), the regu-
lar-season CCHA champ which
the Wolverines beat 5-2 Friday
night on their path to the tourna-
ment, setting up a possible sec-
ond-round matchup between the
rivals.
But, the Wolverines say they'll
just take the tournament one
game at a time, just like the CCHA
tournament.
"We'll focus on Bemidji now,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said. "They knocked Notre Dame
out sof the tournament last year.

with an injury and unable to make
any contributions on the ice.
"It was a huge blow for us," said
senior defenseman Steve Kampfer,
who has stepped up in a leader-
ship role and logged more minutes
since Summers's absence. "He's
our best defenseman game in and
game out.
"When he went down, there was
just more mental preparation from
myself ... and everyone down the
line. We had to step up and make
up for our captain."
The Wolverines lost Summers
to a lower body injury on March
6, and he hasn't seen game time
since. But that might change this
upcoming Saturday in Michi-
gan's NCAA first-round matchup
against Bemidji State. The Milan
native skated at the Joe last Satur-
day before the team's game against
the Wildcats and Berenson said he
would probably be back for next
weekend's game (or games) in Fort
Wayne, Ind.
TAKING HOME SOME HARD-
WARE: Four Wolverines -
Kampfer, junior forwards Louie
Caporusso and Carl Hagelin and
goaltender Shawn Hunwick -
he was named the tournament's
MVP.
"It was obviously nice, but
I think it takes away from the
team," Hunwick said. "The guys
played tremendous, I don't even
know if I deserve to be the MVP.
Six weeks ago if you would have
said I would sit here, 1 would've
said you're crazy."
Despite facing relatively few
shots - just 39 all weekend -
Hunwick stepped up to make the
saves when he needed to. On Fri-
day, Hunwick made three second-
period stops, including one where
he reached back with his stick to
deflect it into the netting.
Hunwick's effort got the Wol-
verines into the locker room up by
a goal. Michigan went on to score
three goals in the first eight min-
utes of the third period.
"You've got a one-goal lead
going into the third period and
They beat Miami this year. So
they're a legitimate team. They
beat Minnesota in a biggame, and
on and on. They're a good team.
They're a legitimate program.
They came out of nowhere last
year. They're notcgoingto surprise
anyone this year."
Miami will play Alabama-
Huntsville in the first round, the
only team in the field with a los-
ing record - which makes the
second-round matchup between
CCHA foes that much more likely.
With Michigan playing in
Fort Wayne, which is just about
two-and-a-half hours away from
Ann Arbor, the Wolverines could
be playing their third straight
weekend in an atmosphere that
resembles home ice. The Wolver-
ines drew a large crowd when
they traveled to Michigan State,
and then again when Michigan
made it to Joe Louis Arena for the
CCHA championship weekend.
"How many times have we sat
here and I've said, 'Geez, I'm dis-,

took home CCHA All-Tournament
Team honors, with Hunwick being
named the tournament's Most
Valuable Player.
Caporusso, who scored Michi-
gan's two goals in Saturday's win,
has 21 points in his last 17 games
and doesn't seem to be slowing
down.
The Ottawa Senator draft pick
was aided by Hunwick's stellar
play as well. He has tallied a 7-1
record in net this year since Bryan
Hogan suffered a groin injury in
late February.
Hunwick played in by far the
most important game of his career
on Saturday - with a win-or-go-
home scenario on his shoulders,
not to mention a 19-year NCAA
Tournament streak. He main-
tained his composure on the ice
and made all of the stops he need-
ed to make in order to keep the
Wolverines in contention.
"I just tried to treat it like any
other game," Hunwick said. "You
just got to take it in five-minute
segments, that's all you want to
do. ... You can't worry about the
60-minute game, it's just too
long."
we talked about if we have to play
the whole game with a one goal-
lead that's fine," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said after Friday's
game. "We're going out to win the
period. As it turned out we got the
first goal and then we got some
momentum and got another one."
After the championship game,
the team, the same one which
started the season 10-10, saw its
name on the bottom of the "CCHA
Champions" banner before it was
sent up into the rafters. The Wol-
verines had 14 wins in 22 games
and won six consecutively. For the
first time all year it was clear they
were the best in the conference.
Amidst the commotion, Beren-
son remained calm as he stayed
behind to do an on-ice interview.
He only had one message as the
team headed into the NCAA tour-
nament.
"We're still climbing."
appointed for our fans because it's
going to be hard to get to Bridge-
port, hard to get to Worcester, or
its hard to get Albany, or Man-
chester and so on, on short notice,'
" Berenson said. "But I'm happy
to say now, it's not hard to get to
Fort Wayne. ... You've got to take
advantage of it. It's all about how
we play, but I can't say epough for
our fans how they helped us get to
where we are right now."
Michigan has fed off the crowd
throughout the CCHA Tourna-
ment and it has only helped its
rejuvenated defensive-minded
hockey. Undefeated in March,
the Wolverines could be a tough
out when the tournament starts
next weekend. And with plentiful
support, Michigan could ride the
momentum to the Frozen Four at
Ford Field.
"I would not be surprised to see
that team continue to advance,"
Kyle said. "And hopefully some-
where, a long ways away, we can
play them again."

far greaerthan what her pointtotal
indicated.
In the second half, Hicks was the
primary defender of Toledo guard
Naama Shafir, who torched the
Wolverines for 23 points, including
going 6-of-7 from three. She scored
13 in the first.
"(Shafir) is as good a guard as
we'll play anywhere," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said. "She
is just, she's off the charts. ... We
thought we were doing a good job on
her but she justgets away from you."
But when Hicks utilized her
length and quickness to keep the
ball out of the Israeli native's hands,
she kept Shafir scoreless for the first
14 minutes of the second half.
"We just together as a team saw
the damage that she was doing to us
in the first half," Hicks said. "We just
wentlike, youknow,we can't get beat
by one player. ... We knew that she
was the key to stoppingthem."
And stopping Shafir became the
difference. The Rockets shot just 22
percent from the field in the second
half, compared to SO percent in the
first. The team was held without a
second-half field goal for more than
12 minutes coming out of halftime.
But Michigan had its own shoot-
ing troubles.
The Wolverines (19-13 overall)
jumped out to an early lead as Phil-
lips scored nine points in the first
four minutes. But when the 6-foot-6

center picked up her second foul, the
smaller Toledo (25-9) lineup took
advantage and forced Michigan to
shoot just 35 percent from the field.
"She scored on the block today
and a lot of times we don't use her
down there and people wonder
why we don't use her down there
at times," Borseth said. "Today she
was very effective."
When the Wolverines went back
to Phillips in the second, it sparked
the run that ultimately won the
game.
Before the season started, in a
closed-door scrimmage, Michigan
took on Toledo in its first matchup
of the year. The game was played as
if it were the first game of the year,
and at that time the nerves of a team
with six freshmen were evident.

"We scrimmaged them early in
the year and they handed it to us,"
Borseth said after the team's win
over Kent State on Friday. "They
had us down by about 15 so we have
to make some adjustments before
we are ready to go."
Yesterday's 15-point win repre-
sents the progress the Wolverines
have made, from the beginning of
the season to where they are now.
The victory is especially impressive
when you consider the surprisingly
large number of Toledo fans, band
members and students that made
the short trip up US-23 forthe game.
With the win, Michigan advanc-
es to the third round of the WNIT
and will play the winner of today's
matchup between Northwestern
and St. Bonaventure.

By BRIAN MECHANICK
For the Daily
Coming off a manhandling
by No. 5 Texas last weekend, the
Michigan men's tennis team came
home looking to take out its frus-
tration on an in-state rival.
In the team's Big Ten opener,
the Michigan men's tennis team
trounced Michigan State, winning
by a score of 6-1. With top player
junior Jason Jung sitting on the
sidelines, freshman Duncan Muil
made his dual meet debut.
The 110th meeting of these sto-
ried rivals got off to an intense start
in doubles, which was no surprise
to Michigan coach Bruce Berque.
"It's always a little bit different,
these big rivalries," Berque said.
"Like football or any other sport,
Michigan State is right up there
with Ohio State and Notre Dame
as far as rivalries go. We knew
we were going to get their best
tonight."
Since Jung was sitting out due
to playing-time limits, Berque was
forced to realign much of the team.
All singles players moved up a spot,
and the pairing of seniors George
Navas and Mike Sroczynski moved
into the No. 1 doubles spot.
Michigan (1-0 Big Ten, 5-6 over-

all) fell behind early when the No.
3 pairing of freshman Chris Cha
and Muil lost 8-4. Michigan's No.
2 pairing freshman Evan King
and junior Chris Madden were in
a back-and-forth match until the
tenth game, when the duo was
finally able to break serve, going on
to win 8-4.
With the first two doubles
matches drawn, Michigan's No.
1 pairing's match would decide
who would take the first point.
After falling behind early, the pair
was able to rally back and take the
match 8-6, givingthe early point to
the Wolverines.
"It definitely was tense," Sroc-
zynski said. "We had to move up
from second doubles to first so that
put on some added pressure. When
we're playing a big rival like Michi-
gan State they want to beat us, so
it was big to come through at the
end."
In only his second No. 1 singles
match of the season, King won 6-1,
6-3.
"It doesn't matter if you play at
No. 1, No. 2 or No. 6," King said,
"You are going to face the same
type of player, same competition.
You've got to be ready."
After King, the matches ended in
quick succession to clinch the Wol-

verine victory over the Spartans
(0-1,11-5). The captain Navas, play-
ing No. 4 singles, won in straight
sets. The clinching match came
soon after in No. 2 singles as Sroc-
zynski came from a first-set deficit
to win in straight sets.
"I was just trying to fight
through the first set," Sroczynski
said. "He had chances to win the
first set 6-3, but I had some good
shots and stayed solid enough that
it could go my way."
But the Wolverines didn't let up,
as No. 5 Cha came back after drop-
ping the first set to win. Madden
ended the day in style, as the lefty
won in three sets. Only Muil came
up on the losing side for the Wol-
verines, losing 7-5, 6-4, after re-
aggravating an ankle injury early
in the first set and not being able to
overcome it.
The importance of starting of
Big Ten Play with a victory was not
lost on Berque.
"A goal for our team is to com-
pete for the Big' Ten Champion-
ship," Berque said, "We have
Minnesota right around the cor-
ner and then Iowa, both teams we
lost to last year. We know every
match in the Big Ten is going to
be tough, but it's really nice to get
one."
