Increased course
offerings, tough
economy contribute
to 26 percent rise
By ANNIE THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
According to data provided by
the University, a lot more students
stayed in Ann Arbor last summer
to take classes compared to previ-
ous years. But exactly the reason
for the boost is less clear.
JoAnn Peraino, curriculum
and enrollment manager for the
College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, wrote in an e-mail
to the Daily that enrollment in
summer courses was up 26 per-
cent compared to last year. But,
there was a 5 percent decline in
spring enrollment.
The cause of the increase in
summer enrollment can be con-
tributed to a variety of measures,
including the addition of more
summer courses, the tough sum-
mer job market and the pressure
many students feel to get required
courses out of the way before
increasingly tight fall and winter
schedules.
This past summer, Peraino
wrote that there was a 38 percent
increase in the number of courses
available and a 2 percent increase
in courses offered for spring
term.
In an interview earlier this
month, University Provost Tere-
sa Sullivan said that last spring

and summer terms, the Univer-
sity offered more classes - all
of them in LSA - in an effort to
keep enrollment up during the
summer months, a strategy that
will be modified in the coming
years.
Sullivan said the new strategy
was successful, creating about
1,400 more credit hours. Howev-
er, she cited a need to re-examine
the effort to ensure its success in
the future.
"It's a good start, but this was
the first year of that plan and we
probably need to make it more
robust," Sullivan said.
Many of the new courses
offered were core course require-
ments that are necessary for stu-
dents to graduate with certain
majors. Sullivan said this may
have been more attractive to stu-
dents interested in graduating
early or getting core classes out of
the way.
"Lots of people aren't going to
hang around in spring and sum-
mer just to (take) electives," Sul-
livan said. "Theywanttogetsome
of their requirements taken care
of."
Business sophomore Thomas
Masotta took Economics 102
during summer term because, he
said, he heard that the class was
easier during the summer and he
also needed to fulfill the require-
ment.
Masotta said if the class
hadn't been offered at the Uni-
versity, he might have taken the
course at a community college
in the area.

Reggae artist's shows
have been cancelled
across the country
for anti-gay rhetoric
By TREVOR CALERO
Daily News Editor
Despite outcry from both state
and campus gay advocacy groups,
the Blind Pig has refused to cancel
a controversial concert set to hit its
stage tonight.
Buju Banton, a reggae musician
known for lyrics that promote
violence against gay men, has had

numerous shows canceled across
the country, most recently in
Detroit, where he was originally
scheduled to play tonight at the
Majestic Theatre.
The Michigan-based gay advo-
cacy group Triangle Foundation,
which played a role in the cancel-
lation of the Detroit show, issued
a statement yesterday about Ban-
ton's performance in Ann Arbor.
"While the Triangle Foundation
is an ardent supporter of artistic
expression and free speech, we do
not condone speech in any form
that promotes violence against
LGBT people," the statement read.
Faith Wood, general manager of
the Blind Pig, said those who are

opposed to Banton's shows have
"information that is very old," and
that those people "haven't looked
beyond that."
"We love and support the gay
community," Wood said. "But to
dictate and not allow somebody
to perform for something they've
said 20 years ago" is wrong.
Wood said that though some
of Banton's earlier songs refer-
ence violence against gay people,
she believes that he has since
denounced those lyrics and is try-
ing to "change that image."
Wood referenced the Reggae
Compassionate Act of 2007, which
Banton signed along with a num-
ber of other reggae performers.

The act reads: "We pledge that
our music will continue to con-
tribute positively to the world dia-
logue on peace, respect and justice
for all.
"To this end, we agree to not
make statements or perform songs
that incite hatred or violence
against anyone from any commu-
nity."
Banton's most controversial
song "Boom Bye-Bye," which was
recorded in 1992, references shoot-
ing "batty bwoys" - a derogatory
phrase for gay men - with Uzis
and, as many claim the lyrics sug-
gest, bu.rning their skin with acid.

DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT
Construction of new parking
structure upsets nearby shops

Building project
would hurt business,
claim Herb David,
Jerusalem Garden
By GRACELIN BASKARAN
For the Daily
The two-year construction of an
underground parking deck is set to
begin downtown tomorrow, but the
owners of Jerusalem Garden and
Herb David Guitar Studio say they
have been overlooked in the process.
On Feb. 17, the Ann Arbor
Downtown Development Author-
ity approved the construction of a
new underground parking deck on
South Fifth Avenue. The construc-
tion will also include water mains,
pedestrian walkways and electric
transformers to encourage new
businesses to build on the location,
according to the DDA's website.
Despite the apparent benefits
of the underground deck, two
local businesses are fighting back
against the project.
The owners of Jerusalem Gar-
den and Herb David Guitar Stu-
dio filed a complaint with the city
attorney last month claiming the
vibrations from the construction
would damage their buildings.

MSA officials finalize trimmed
down budget for this semester

E. WILLIAM ST.
The owners of Herb David Guitar Studio and Jerusalem Garden (top and bottom
black boxes, respectively) have complained that vibrations and noise from the
construction site (bottom brown box) will damage their businesses.

The 300 block of South Fifth
Avenue, where both businesses are
located, will also be closed for six
months starting December 2010
due to construction.
Ali Ramlawi, owner of Jerusa-
lem Garden, said closure would
deter customers from his business.
However, Adrian Iraola, senior
project manager from Park Avenue
Consultants, the company hired

for the job, said some of the nega-
tive feedback has been caused by
misinformation about the project.
"I don't think this project will
affect the businesses any more
than any other construction proj-
ects," Iraola said. "There will be
the noise and vibration, but there
are measures we take to reduce it."
Iraola said his company has

Assembly also hears
about new ride-share
program at 'U
By MALLORY JONES
Daily StaffReporter
At last night's meeting, the
Michigan Student Assembly ap-
proved a resolution to enact its
fall 2009 budget, officially start-
ing all MSA activities for the se-
mester.
Expenditures and reserves
for the coming period total
$333,274.50. That figure reduces
the budget by $13,437.50 from
Winter 2009 and $34,530.60 from

Fall 2008.
MSA Treasurer Vishal Bajaj
said student organizations fund-
ed by MSA will not be affected
by the funding changes. The Bud-
get Priority Committee and the
Community Service Commission,
which allocate money to student
groups, have the same budget
they had last year.
However, cuts were made in
other commissions and commit-
tees because in the past MSA
had gone beyond the spending its
code allowed.
"We were bringing everything
back to the levels that they were
supposed to be at cause it just
wasn't lawful to our code any-
more," Bajaj said.

A handful of MSA committees
and commissions were not allo-
cated any money in this budget.
In the past two budgets, each
committee and commission was
allocated at least a small amount.
"The committees or commis-
sions that have zero funding
didn't apply for a budget," Bajaj
said.
These groups will be inactive
this semester, Bajaj said.
Among the most notable
of the unfunded groups is the
North Campus Affairs Commis-
sion, which received $5,775 last
winter and the Disability Issues
Committee, which received $475
last winter.

MONDAY: TUESDAY:WEC
In Other Ivory Towers Off the Beaten Path Cam
Art on a frozen canvas

THURSDAY: FRIDAY:
Before You Were Here Photos of the Week

LSA junior Andrew Dick-
son is an artist, but not in the
traditional sense. His brush-
es and colored pencils are a
chainsaw and a blowtorch,
and his canvas is a 300-pound
block of ice.
Dickson is an ice carver
and one of three presidents
of the University's Michigan
Ice Carving Team. The group
creates ice sculptures for sale
and for competitions across
the state.
He said the uniqueness of
the opportunity first drew
him in.
"I was looking for some-
thing that was outside the
mainstream," Dickson said.
The team was started in
2001 as part of Alice Lloyd
Hall's Arts on the Hill pro-
gram and is now a full-fledged
club advised by Michigan
League chef Aaron Bruck.

Most of the team's 20 some
members were recruited with
no prior experience.
Engineering junior Stephen
Wald, one of the team's presi-
dents, said that joining the
club can be overwhelming at
first because of the dangerous
tools members use and the
difficulties associated with
carving ice.
"Ice is really fragile, but at
the same time it's a ton a fun,"
he said. "When you mess up
you have to keep going."
But, members say, the
amateur nature of the team
doesn't hinder it in competi-
tion.
This past January, the Uni-
versity received first place at
the Plymouth Ice Festival for
team competition.
The team usually competes
against students from culi-
nary arts programs who learn

ice carving as part of their
curriculum.
Among the team's creations
are sculptures of the Univer-
sity's block 'M', a starfish, a
bear, Pikachu from Pokemon
and a glass cup with ice cubes
in it.
"You see a lot of animals
and swans and fish," said LSA
senior Max Weston, a former
team president. "Somebody
carved a big tooth brushing
itself. I've seen submarines,
sharks. Last year I carved an
elephant fish."'
The team also carves cus-
tom sculptures for students
and organizations on campus.
The sculptures start at a base
price of $120.
"We sold a couple to frater-
nities for Saturday morning
activities," Dickson said.

Toyota cites stuck accelerator risk for big recall

Company will recall
3.8 million vehicles,
including Camry
and Prius
WASHINGTON (AP) - Toyo-
ta Motor Corp. said yesterday it
will recall 3.8 million vehicles in
the United States, the company's
largest-ever U.S. recall, to address
problems with a removable floor
mat that could cause accelerators
to get stuck and lead to a crash.
The recall will involve popular
models such as the Toyota Camry,
the top-selling passenger car in
America, and the Toyota Prius,
the best-selling gas-electric
hybrid.
Toyota said it was still working
with officials with the National
Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-

tration to find a remedy to fix the
problem and said owners could be
notified about the recall as early
as next week.
Toyota spokesman Irv Miller
said until the company finds a
fix, owners should take out the
removable floor mat on the driv-
er's side and not replace it.
"A stuck open accelerator pedal
may result in very high vehicle
speeds and make it difficult to
stop a vehicle, which could cause
a crash, serious injury or death,"
Miller said.
NHTSA said it had received
reports of 102 incidents in which
the accelerator may have become
stuck on the Toyota vehicles
involved.
It was unclear how many led
to crashes but the inquiry was
prompted by a highspeed crash
in August in California of a Lexus
barreling out of control. As the

vehicle hit speeds exceeding 120
mph, family members made a
frantic 911 call and said the accel-
erator was stuck and they couldn't
stop the vehicle.
"This is an urgent matter,"
Transportation Secretary Ray
LaHood said in a statement. "For
everyone's sake, we strongly urge
owners of these vehiclesto remove
mats or other obstacles that could
lead to unintended acceleration."
The recall will affect 2007-2010
model year Toyota Camry, 2005-
2010 Toyota Avalon, 2004-2009
Toyota Prius, 2005-2010 Tacoma,
2007-2010 Toyota Tundra, 2007-
2010 Lexus ES350 and 2006-2010
Lexus IS250 and IS350.
Toyota's previously largest U.S.
recall was about 900,000 vehicles
in 2005 to fix a steering issue.
The company declined to say how
many complaints it had received
about the accelerator issue.

The Japanese automaker
warned owners that if they think
their vehicle is accelerating out of
control, they should check to see
whether their floor mat is under
the pedal.
If a driver can't remove the
floor mat, Toyota advises drivers
to step on the brake pedal with
both feet until the vehicle slows
and then try to put it into neutral
and switch the ignition to acces-
sory power.
For vehicles with engine start/
stop buttons, Toyota said the
engine can be shut off by holding
the button down for three sec-
onds.
In the August incident near
San Diego, the fiery crash of a
2009 Lexus ES 350 killed Califor-
nia Highway Patrol Officer Mark
Saylor, 45, and three members
of his family on State Route 125
in Santee. The runaway car was

traveling at more than 120 mph
when it hit a sport utility vehicle,
launched off an embankment,
rolled several times and burst into
flames.
One of the family members
calledpolice aboutaminutebefore
the crash to report the vehicle
had no brakes and the accelerator
was stuck. The call ended with
someone telling people in the car
to hold on and pray, followed by a
woman's scream.
NHTSA investigators deter-
mined that a rubber all-weather
floor mat found in the wreckage
was slightly longer than the mat
thatbelonged in the vehicle, some-
thing that could have snared or
covered the accelerator pedal.
Toyota spokesman John Han-
son said the final report had not
yet been submitted in the Califor-
nia case.
"We don't know what the

actual cause was of that accid5ent
other than preliminary reports
that have been published so it's
impossible for us to comment on
that particular incident," Hanson
said.
In mid-September, Toyota
ordered 1,400 Toyota and Lexus
dealers nationwide to ensure that
each new, used and loaner vehi-
cles had the proper floor mats
and that the mats were properly
secured.
In September 2007, Toyota
recalled an accessory all-weath-
er floor mat sold for use in some
2007 and 2008 model year Lexus
ES 350 and Toyota Camry vehicles
because of similar problems.

sumers can contact the National

State to mom: Stop
baby-sitting
neighbors' kids
Each day before the school bus
comes to pick up the neighbor-
hood's children, Lisa Snyder did a
favor for three of her fellow moms,
welcoming their children into her
home for about an hour before
they left for school.
Regulators who oversee child
care, however, don't see it as char-
ity. Days after the start of the new
school year, Snyder received a let-
ter fromthe Michigan Department
of Human Services warning her
that if she continued, she'd be vio-
lating a law aimed at the operators
of unlicensed day care centers.
"I was freaked out. I was blown
away," she said. "Igot on the phone
immediately, called my husband,
then I called all the girls" - that
is, the mothers whose kids she
watches - "every one of them."
Snyder's predicament has led to
a debate in Michigan about wheth-
er a law that says no one may care
for unrelated children in their
home for more than four weeks
each calendar year unless they are
licensed day-care providers needs
to be changed. It also has irked
parents who say they depend on
such friendly offers to help them
balance work and family.

a budget for the Department of
Human Services before it quit
voting for the night, but several
tough votes remain for both
chambers before the midnight
deadline tonight.
Cities, townships and some
counties use revenue-sharing
payments to help cover the
cost of police, firefighters and
other services. The 11 percent
cut approved by the Senate was
slightly less than what legisla-
tive leaders agreed to previ-
ously but was still a blow to
municipalities already strug-
gling with falling property tax
revenues.
Democrats voted against
the cuts, with Sen. Deb Cher-

ry of Burton worrying that
less money could mean slower
response times for hard-hit fire
departments. She said the deep
cuts would hurt Michigan's
future.
"It's just not good enough to
keep our people safe and ensure
we have the kind of state ready
to make a long-term economic
recovery," Cherry said.
Republicans countered that
spending cuts are necessary
because tax collections have
dropped by billions of dollars
in the ailing economy.
Democrats agreed that the
falling revenues mean reduc-
tions are needed, but said
some were too deep. They were
still talking about passing tax
increases to avoid some cuts
and keep programs such as
the Michigan Promise college
scholarship.
But with time running out,
no tax increases seemed immi-
nent.
Lawmakers instead might
try to tap more stimulus money
than they previously expected
to lessen cuts in K-12 education
and other budgets. Schools are
unhappy with cuts that could
translate to about $218 per stu-
dent unless more Recovery Act
money is used.
"The magnitude of the cut to
the K-12 budget is pretty sig-
nificant," Democratic House
Speaker Andy Dillon said.
"Education is the future of this
state. We need to fund it and we
need to send a message that we
want to fund it."

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Max Baucus (second from right) talks with Sen, Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) yesterday.
Senate panel: No gov't option

Finance Committee
votes twice to reject
public option
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
long-anticipated showdown, liberal
Democrats twice failed yesterday to
inject a government-run insurance
option into sweeping health care
legislation taking shape in the Sen-
ate, despite bipartisan agreement
that private insurers must change
their ways.
The two votes marked a victory
for Montana Democrat Max Bau-
cus, the Senate Finance Committee
chairman, who is hoping to push
his middle-of-the-road measure
through the panel by week's end. It
also kept alive the possibility that at
least one Republican may yet swing
behind the overhaul, a key goal of
both Baucus and the White House.
The developments occurred as
Democrats in the House sought
savings to reduce their companion
legislation to roughly $900 billion
over a decade, the price tag Presi-

dent Barack Obama has suggested.
One option under consideration
would reduce the number of indi-
viduals and families eligible for
federal health coverage subsidies
to those earning less than 400 per-
cent of poverty, or about $43,000
for a single person and $88,000 for
a family of four, officials said, com-
menting only on condition of ano-
nymity. The subsidies are designed
to make insurance more affordable,
and account for a significant per-
centage of spending in the bill.
Without disclosing any of the
details of a marathon closed-door
leadership meeting, Majority Leader
Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters,
"It's hard work, but we're determined
to get it (the bill's cost) down."
If anything, the health care debate
was growing more intense. According
to one independentorganization, tele-
vision advertising around the issue
has been running at a level of more
than $1.1 million a day for the past
week and now stands over $100 mil-
lion since the beginning ofthe year.
Inside the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.,

said his proposal to allow the gov-
ernment to sell insurance in com-
petition with private industry was
far from the federal takeover that
critics portray. "It's not. It's option-
al," he said, adding it was designed
to offer competition and a lower-
priced, reliable choice for consum-
ers shopping for coverage.
"Washington is not the answer,"
countered Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah.
The key votes were cast by Baucus
and four other Democrats, who sided
with Republicans who were united
against the proposed change in the
bill. "The public option would help to
hold insurance companies' feet to the
fire, I don't think there's much doubt
about that, but my first job is to get
this bill across the finish line," said
the chairman, who had proposed
a system of nonprofit cooperatives
similar to Midwestern agricultural
or electric co-ops instead.
"No one shows me how to get to
60 votes with a public option," Bau-
cus said, employing the term used
to describe a new government role
in health care.

FILI SAGAPOLUTELE/Af
A main road in the Fagatogo is seen flooded by water from a tsunami in the main town area in American Samoa yesterday
Quake triggers powerful Pacific
Ocean tsunami, killing dozens

At least 39 killed
but death toll still
on rise, officials say
PAGO PAGO, American Samoa
(AP) - A powerful Pacific Ocean
earthquake spawned towering
tsunami waves that swept ashore
on Samoa and American Samoa,
flooding and flattening villages,
killing dozens of people and leav-
ing several workers missing at
devastated National Park Service
facilities.
Cars and people were swept
out to sea by the fast-churning
water as survivors fled to higher
ground, where they remained
huddled hours after the quake
struck early yesterday. Signs of
immense devastation were every-
where, with a giant boat getting
washed ashore and coming to
rest on the edge of a highway and
floodwaters swallowing up cars
and homes.
The quake, with a magni-
tude between 8.0 and 8.3, struck
around dawn about 20 miles
below the ocean floor, 120 miles
(190 kilometers) from American
Samoa, a U.S. territory that is
home to 65,000 people.
Hampered by power and com-
munications outages, officials
hours later struggled to geta han-
dle on the damage and casualties.
At least 39 people were killed -
20 on Samoa and 19 on American
Samoa - but officials acknowl-
edged the death toll seemed sure
to rise.
"I don't think anybody is going
to be spared in this disaster," said

acting American Samoa Gov. Faoa
A. Sunia.
Mase Akapo, a meteorologist
for the National Weather Service
in American Samoa, reported at
least 19 people killed in four dif-
ferent villages on the main island
of Tutuila. Officials reported at
least 50 injured, and possibly
many more.
In neighboring Samoa, an
Associated Press reporter saw
the bodies of about 20 victims in a
hospital at Lalomanu town on the
south coast of the main island of
Upolu, and said the surrounding
tourist coast had been devastated.
At least three villages were flat-
tened.
Sunia declared a state of
emergency in American Samoa,
describing "immense and wide-
spread damage to individual, pub-
lic and commercial buildings in
coastal areas" along with death
and injury. Gov. Togiola Tulafono,
who was in Honolulu for a con-
ference, told reporters that more
victims could be found when res-
cuers reach areas that are inac-
cessible by roads.
Tulafono says his immediate
family was safe, but there was at
least one death among his extend-
ed family.
Ofthe death toll, New Zealand's
acting Prime Minister Bill English
said that there has "really only
been guesses, but some of these
places appear to have been hit
very hard, and you would expect
considerable loss of life."
"I would underline the fact that
this is a situation that's unfold-
ing," English said. "We don't have
information about the full impact

and we do have some real concern
that over the next 12 hours the
picture could look worse rather
than better."
America Samoa is home to a
U.S. national park that appeared
to be especially hard-hit. Holly
Bundock, spokeswoman for the
National Park Service's Pacific
West Region in Oakland, Calif.,
said the superintendent of the
park and another .staffers had
been able to locate only 20 percent
of the park's 13 to 15 employees
and 30 to 50 volunteers.
Mike Reynolds, superintendent
of the National Park of American
Samoa, was quoted as saying four
tsunami waves 15 to 20 feet high
roared ashore soon afterward,
reaching up to a mile inland. Bun-
dock said Reynolds spoke to offi-
cials from under a coconut tree
uphill from Pago Pago Harbor
and reported that the park's visi-
tor center and offices appeared to
have been destroyed.
Residents in both Samoa and
American Samoa reported being
shaken awake by the quake,
which lasted two to three min-
utes. It was followed by at least
three large aftershocks of at least
5.6 magnitude.
New Zealander Graeme Ansell
said the beach village of Sau Sau
Beach Fale was leveled.
"It was very quick. The whole
village has been wiped out,"
Ansell told New Zealand's Nation-
al Radio from a hill near Samoa's
capital, Apia. "There's not a build-
ing standing. We've all clambered
up hills, and one of our party has a
broken leg. There will be people in
a great lot of need 'round here."

Defeat by delay
City Council hesitation halted crucial housing development
While less fortunate citizens of Ann Arbor are proba-
bly better off than residents of other Michigan cities,
Ann Arbor is still in need of more economical living.
Truly affordable housing is greatly needed for certain residents
and students in the city, which is why it's a shame some devel-
opers are having such a hard time constructing it. Over the last
few weeks, Ann Arbor City Council has stalled on approving City
Place, a new student housing project. A reconfigured plan for the
project was finally approved last Monday, but the approved ver-
sion is greatly reduced from what the developer initially intend-
ed. City Council's leadership on this issue has been lacking, and
moving forward, the council should treat the need for housing

more seriously.
Developer Alex de Parry originally
proposed the construction of City Place,
a low-income apartment complex along
Fifth Avenue downtown, in early 2008.
He aimed the project at residents whose
income falls 80-90 percent below the city's
median income. De Parry originally sought
to create three separate apartment build-
ings containing 90 housing units for a total
of 164 bedrooms. The buildings would also
have been equipped with 96 underground
parking spaces.
But this vision failed to pass City Coun-
cil. Instead, the version finally approved -
which City Council continued to delay its
vote on until de Parry threatened a lawsuit
- will create two smaller buildings with
a parking lot between the two. There will
be 24 units with 6 bedrooms within each
unit. And instead of underground parking
with 96 spaces, there will be a ground-level
parking lot with only 36 spaces.
The blame for City Place's diminished
size rests squarely with City Council.
Despite Ann Arbor's need for lower-income.
housing, City Council consistently failed
to make progress on the plan, instead suc-
cumbing to the demands of some whose
vision for the city does not provide ade-
quate housing for all. Instead of stalling the
project for nearly two years, City Council

should have worked with de Parry to build
a housing complex that will meet the needs
of Ann Arbor's less fortunate residents.
There are many Ann Arbor residents
in need of affordable housing, and City
Place could have been an answer to their
problems. Affordable housing close to
downtown would offer living space for
low-income residents who work in the city.
Without this housing, low-income families
are forced to move toward the outskirts of
the city, which worsens the city's socioeco-
nomic divide. Additionally, this places the
burden of commuting on the residents who
are least able to afford it.
Residents do have some concerns that
are worth consideration. The construc-
tion of City Place requires the destruc-
tion of several older houses that provide
some historic value to the city. But if City
Council is going to prioritize the preserva-
tion of these houses, it should have found
an alternate location for de Parry to build.
Such concerns shouldn't be placed above
the needs of pw-incoe citizegs. .
The city needs to workharder to provide
housing for all types of residents, includ-
ing low-income families and students. City
Council should keep everyone's housing
needs in mind to avoid botching proposals
for affordable housing in the future.

n Sept. 15, President Barack
Obama reiterated his support
for equal pay for equal work
laws in a speech
at the AFL-CIO
Convention in
Pittsburgh. He
reminded con-
vention attendees
that "the very firstn
bill I signed into
law was the Lilly
Ledbetter Act to VINCENT
uphold the basic
principle of equal PATSY
pay for equal
work." This bill
strengthened the ability of workers
to sue an employer with the intention
of reducing race - or gender - based
discrimination in the workplace. But
this law - and other equal pay laws
like it - is bound to fail because the
progenitor of all unequal pay for
equal work is the government itself.
The free market assures that workers
are paid what they deserve. All the
government can possibly do is cor-
rupt this system.
Wages are determined by the output
of the worker.If I produce $80 worth of
goods in an eight-hour shift, my wage
will tend toward $10 an hour in the free
market. This is true because if I were
paid less than $9 an hour, it would be
beneficial for a different employer to
hire me at $9.50 an hour, thereby earn-
ingthe extra$.50 perhouron mylabor.
This process of constant outbidding
continues until the $10 per hour level
is reached. This level is called the Mar-
ginal Value Product.
I will admit that widespread dis-
crimination is possible in the free
market. But those who discriminate
pay very dearly for their discrimina-
tion: Employers who discriminate
get lower profits and consumers get
fewer choices. To come up with an
example that removes racial and gen-
der implications, let's suppose that

every American employerhated Cana-
dian workers and decided to pay them
less than their actual contribution to
a finished product. Each Canadian,
although producing at a level of $10
per hour, was only paid $5 per hour.
In this situation, a couple of things.
can be said. One, it opens a gap in the
market where non-discriminating
employers can hire exclusively Cana-
dians and make massive profits. Two,
those who suffer most from under-
paying Canadians, and consequently
also overpaying Americans for equal
work, are employers. The employers
themselves are earning lower profits
and therefore paying for their anti-
Canadian discrimination.
The point is that the solution to
discrimination is not the govern-
ment, but rather the market. The very
fact that employers are not actively
excluding Canadians from jobs sug-
gests one of the following cases:
Either "discriminated" workers are
being paid the right amount or the
government is oppressing them. In
other words, there must be either no
problem and no government action is
needed, or the government is causing
the problem and all that is necessary
is for them to get out of the way.
If any liberals actually believe that
there is widespread discrimination
against a group of potential workers,
then liberals should start businesses
and pay that group more than their
existing wage. Because most busi-
nesses are interested in making a
large profit, this type of mass hiring
should already be taking place under
a free market. Since it is not taking
place, then either the government is
oppressing people or workers deserve
the wage they get. x _
Equal pay' for tquat ork laws
hurts those who are allegedly dis-
criminated more than those who
are not discriminated. Suppose the
Canadian workers, for whatever rea-
son, are less productive and produce

fewer goods per day than American
workers, resulting in lower pay for
the Canadians. Ifa law is passed say-
ing that Canadians have to be paid
the same as Americans regardless of
level of production, the result would
be that no Canadians would be hired
- precisely the reverse of what the
law intended.
The government
can't fix wage
discrimination.
The idea of forcing "fair pay" for
everyone is a hopeless quest. For one,
some people (myself included) find
myjob deeplymotivatingin itself, and
the fact that I derive more enjoyment
from my job than my colleagues could
be considered unfair. Do I deserve a
lower wage in order to balance things
out and make my net benefit from my
job equal to that of my colleagues?
How would you discount the wages
of the middle class to make them fair
when compared with the lower class?
And even if everyone worked solely
for the wages they earned, wouldn't
it seem at least possible that some
form of nepotism or playing favorites
would occur?
Rather than being the solution to
the problem, government interven-
into waescreates theproblem.
he' goVernment, by fa'orTng sme
workers over others, creates divisions
in society. There is no such thing as a
free lunch inseconomics, anwoekers
'shioutd be paid according to vha tey
produce. Only the free market can
guarantee equal pay for equal work.

Cliches you meet in college

Here at the University, students play a num-
ber of different roles. There are the partiers,
the studiers and the slackers. While it's been
my experience that many people fall securely
into one of the aforementioned stereotypes, it's
more common for these subsections to overlap.
This doesn't mean that other groups don't exist
- these just seem to be the most obvious when
you compare the different students here.
I may only be one year older than you youn-
gins, butI have learned a lot during my time here.
The sooner you realize the inherent wisdom of
my advice, the sooner you'll find your way, grass-
hoppers. You don't want to simply fall into one
of these groups out of a perceived necessity, no
matter how appealing it may seem. You have an
unbelievable opportunity to invent yourself, and
ruining it by taking the easy way out and becom-
ing a breathing clich6 would be such a waste. And
for all of you who have seen "Mean Girls" I'm
sure you know all about these cliches.
The University of Michigan may not be as
hardcore as Michigan State University when
it comes to majoring in alcohol. But you have
to admit, for one of the top universities in the
country, we really know how to throw a shin-
dig. From fraternities to block parties, rang-
ing from beer and jungle juice to foam dance
floors, there's never a weekend during which
some group of people isn't getting drunk and
making mistakes that they'll regret the next
day. The people who live in this world of per-
petual intoxication thrive on having fun and
writing seven-page papers while hungover on
Sunday afternoon.
This isn't to say that this group doesn't
do well in their classes. As a matter of fact, I
know several people who party almost every
night and still put a majority of their class-
mates' GPAs to shame. What it comes down to
is skill. Can you be out all night, get very little
sleep and still be able to force yourself to read
about the sociological ramifications of laugh-
ing at a sexist joke? For most people I've seen,
the answer is "no." But for those select few
who can, I congratulate you. For those of you
who have already skipped most of your classes
because you were just too tired from last night,
maybe it's time for a change. Add some balance
to your life.
This brings me to the partiers' natural oppo-

sites, the studiers. These students - those
who came to the University for the academics
instead of the football legacy - do all of their
homework. This is regardless of the fact that
they have three 40-page articles - ones they
will never be tested on - to read before their
next poli-sci lecture. Weekends are devoted to
the UGLi, and the closest thing they'll get to
receiving an MIP is getting stopped by a Depart-
ment of Public Safety officer to make sure that
their water bottles aren't really vodka.
After reading this description, words like
"over-achiever" or "nerd" might come to mind.
It seems that these students have no life out-
side of class, and it's true some students study
more than others - sometimes more than nec-
essary - but I don't see how this is always a
bad thing. We came to the University to make
something out of ourselves and actually get a
degree. Balancing studying and fun should be
one of our main priorities. My advice for all you
bookworms out there is to take a study break
with friends, get some pizza and watch a car-
toon Macaulay Culkin fight his way out of his
library in "The Pagemaster."
Then there are of course the slackers. What
can I say about this group? They range from
watching episodes of "The Office" all day to
smoking pot in the cemetery at night. They got
into the University on near-perfect test scores,
never go to class and still ace every exam in
Math 116. This group is fairly self-explanatory
and the most self-fulfilling. But if you think
you can coast through four years here and
come out with a GPA higher than the legal
blood alcohol level, you're sadly mistaken.
Like the other groups, slackers need to balance
out their lives with more wholesome fun and
decent hours of studying.
For all you freshmen out there trying to find
a niche, take this simple advice. No matter who
you think you are, remember that balance and
variety are the keys to a successful run in col-
lege. Mix it up - party Friday night, have a
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" marathon on Sat-
urday and study on Sunday. It's never good to
fall into only one category. No one wants to be a
walking stereotype.

COLLEGE DEMOCRATS|
Republican budget a bust

Two weeks ago, State Senate Majority Leader Mike
Bishop announced the Senate Republicans' plan to solve
Michigan's budget problems before the Oct. 1 deadline.
His plan, which was formed without consulting Gover-
nor Jennifer Granholm or House Democrats, represents
the core of the Michigan Republican Party's ideology -
namely, the decimation of state services. Bishop's bud-
get is bad for working families, students, police, doctors,
firefighters, local governments and low-income com-
munities. It would roll back any progress our state has
made over the last several years toward a new, stable
economy.
The bill would cut:
" Michigan Promise Grant college scholarship: $140
million.
 Other college financial aid programs and scholar-
ships: $48 million.
" Reimbursement for community colleges for property
tax revenue lost because of renaissance zones: $4 mil-
lion.
" $14 a month from Supplemental Security Income,
which provides assistance to the elderly and people with
disabilities who live independently: $30 million.
- Payment rates to health care providers who treat
Medicaid patients by 8 percent: $355 million.
" Substance abuse services by 5 percent: $1 million.
" Healthy Michigan programs that combat infant mor-
tality, minority health, poison control centers, senior
nutrition services and diseases ranging from heart dis-
ease to arthritis: $20 million.
- Revenue sharing payments to local governments
(police, firefighters, other city services): $90 million.
This is only a sample of the severe cuts this bill makes
to our state's government. And the bill wouldn't raise a
single dollar of additional revenue. Bishop's plan doesn't
attempt to close loopholes in Michigan's severely flawed
tax system or propose any additional changes to the state's

structural deficit. This is a reckless attempt to strangle
the government to the detriment of students and working
families.
What's worse, Speaker of the House Andy Dillon -
without having proposed a budget resolution plan of his
own - agrees with Bishop and is willing to adopt the
Republican plan. Dillon is a Democrat, and has pledged to
secure Democratic support for this disastrous bill.
The College Democrats at the University of Michigan
cannot stand for this plan or anyone who supports it.
Eviscerating the budget in this way will irreparably harm
Michigan. If young people are the future of this state, the
Bishop/Dillon proposal is killing any hope for Michigan's
future. The proposed programs to be cut are proof of that.
On top of cutting health services for children, the bill
would eliminate the Michigan Promise Scholarship, deal-
ing a severe blow to students. 96,000 students statewide
rely on this program, and over 5,000 students here at the
University are eligible for the program's scholarships.
There is some pushback against the Bishop/Dillon
budget deal, and Granholm still has the ability to veto
the final budget bill. The budget bills proposed by Gra-
nholm and the Senate Democrats made significant cuts,
yet retained essential fundingfor education, police, medi-
cal and fire and added additional revenue to help the state
deal with the deficit. Unfortunately, this movement is up
against significant opposition that is committed to cram-
ming through a flawed budget at all costs.
In short, the Bishop/Dillon budget will hurt the quality
of our education, health care and public services, and, as a
result, our state's future. We need a budget that preserves
these essentials that we - as students and residents of
Michigan - rely on and deserve.
This viewpoint was written by DJ Heebner, Lindsay
Mlars and Nathaniel Eli Coats Styer on behalf of the
University's chapter of the College Democrats.

ABC uses chaos and
conundrum to build an
exceptional show
By JAMIE BLOCK
Senior Arts Editor
Chaos, when done right, can make for
some of the world's
most beautiful imag-
ery. And in the scenes
immediately following FlashForward
the miraculous, cata-T
strophic event that sets Thursdays
off ABC's new series at8 p.m.
"FlashForward," chaos ABC
is most certainly done
right. Where the chaos goes from there,
however, is not quite as perfect.
It all begins when the world is going
r about a normal day. People are driving,
flying, working and doing whatever else
the global population does - until, that
is, everyone passes out all at once. For 137
seconds, every human on this planet goes
unconscious. The added kick? Each person
gets to see a glimpse of his or her future at
the same specific point: April 29 at 10 p.m.,
Pacific Time - about six months into the
future from the momentary global sleep.
Some see their lives falling apart, oth-
ers see their lives revitalized. Many never

come out of these visions, as the death toll
from everyone on Earth passing out spon-
taneously is unimaginably high - there are
thousands upon thousands of crashes, not
to mention failed surgeries and falls from
fatal heights, tumbles on staircases and
many other unforeseen dangers.
This plot premise is undeniably unique
in a fall lineup full of shows in easy-to-
pin-down genres. It appears there may be
some credence to the hype that "Flash-
Forward" could be the next "Lost." With
epic music, big ideas and an accomplished
cast, ABC's new supernatural drama
stands apart from the rest. It stands
above most of them, too.
The star cast is led by Joseph Fiennes
(heartthrob star of "Shakespeare in Love")
who plays agent Mark Benford. Mark's
vision: He sees himself making a break-
through on his investigation of the event's
cause, only to be attacked by men in masks
with sniper rifles. "FlashForward" appears
to embrace time paradoxes, as Mark uses
what he saw in his vision to get his inves-
tigation started.
A lot of the cast members, however,
aren't so lucky with their visions. Mark's
wife Olivia (Sonya Walger, "Lost") sees
herself cheating on Mark with a man she
doesn't even know yet. And Mark's partner
Demetri Ndh(John Cho, Harold of"Harold
and Kumar" fame) saw nothing at all. The
cast is faced with the remarkable challenge

of playing characters who know where
they're going but not how they get there,
and every single actor steps up and meets
this challenge.
The show succeeds in creating a con-
stant sense of mystery. There are always
new questions arising, and Mark will hope-
fully be able to solve some of them: What
happened, what (or who) caused it and can
the future be changed? "FlashForward" is,
if nothing else, absolutely gripping. Every
moment is suspenseful and carries the
weight of beingtruly important.
But the true flaw of "FlashForward" is
its focus onthe investigation - notbecause
investigating the event is a move toward
the wrong plotline, but because the show
only follows this single team. The group
pass-out was a global event. The entire
planet plunged into calamity, chaos, panic
and turmoil. By having such a narrow
focus, "FlashForward" doesn't fully flesh
out its own premise; the show might have
set a bar too high for it to reach.
These problems could all be fixed soon,
though. A lengthy string of preview clips
from this season shows that the investiga-
tion will at least lead to a German theorist.
If "FlashForward" makes a theme of inter-
national interaction, it could manage to
meet the expectations it set up for itself. It
already has the whole epic thing down. If
it can put its immense coolness to use, only
time will tell.

Some movies will change your life.
"Fame" is notone of them. It's not an ambi-
tious movie. Instead of
inspiring, "Fame" merely
seeks to entertain. At
times it even succeeds - Fame

are, if not well choreo-
graphed, at least inter- and Showcase
esting to watch. MGM
The musical, a remake
of the 1980 Alan Parker-directed classic, is
a far cry from the gritty original. While the
original musical had characters question-
ing their religious affiliation, struggling
with their sexual identity and entertain-
ing thoughts of suicide, the new, watered-
down, PG version just has characters
sulking over their stern instructors and
parents.
The film follows a select group of stu-
dents through their four years at the
prestigious New York City High School
of Performing Arts, and reintroduces a
familiar set of typecasts: a bratty would-be
actress, a poet suffering from a heavy dose
of teen angst and a wide-eyed, naive song-
stress, to name afew.
To appease the preteen girl demo-
graphic, the film even includes a romance
between the haughty, aspiring actress
Jenny (relative newcomer Kay Panabaker)
and the more laid-back singer Marco (rela-
tive newcomer Asher Book). The idea is
that opposites attract. The acting, howev-
er, is wooden, and the banter between the
two is tiresome.
The dialogue falls painfully flat through-
out the film. There is no exchange of clever
repartee or meaningful conversation. In
the first few minutes of the film, a dance
instructor responding to a hopeful country
bumpkin from Iowa gives this sparkling
gem of advice: "Don't worry, you might
be back in Iowa sooner than you think."
Witty, right?
Other, not-so memorable lines:

Boy: "I have talent."
Principal: "And who on Earth told you
that?"
Boy: "You did."
The structure of the film is just as for-
mulaic as its characters, and similarly rife
with cliches. The urban dance genre heav-
ily influences the film, and much of the
musical consists of dance montages and
close-ups of students artistically perspir-
ing, with furrowed brows and looks of
heavy concentration.
Fans of "Step Up" be warned, this isn't
a movie for you - it's not seductive in any
sense and it lacks a brooding Channing
Tatum-like character. It lacks the humor
and bubbliness of "High School Musical."
And unlike "America's Got Talent" contes-
tants, the movie lacks actors with raw, real
talent.
The movie, basically, is lacking.
This is all unfortunate, because the
premise, although contrived and redun-
dant, seemspromising enough tobe at least
A film lacking in
everything.
somewhat entertaining. A group of kids
from different walks of life, connected only
through their aspirations of rising above
the masses, attempt to fulfill their dreams
of fame. The classic underdog story.
But after over an hour and a half of clich6
piled on cliche, it's apparent that the movie,
unlike its tagline, will definitely not "live
forever." Although at times mildly amusing,
the film is still utterly forgettable. Clearly,
director Kevin Tancharoen hopes to appeal
to a wide audience with his family-friendly
musical. But by simultaneously trying to
cater to the "High School Musical" crowd,
the MTV audience and reality TV enthusi-
asts, his ambitions, like his movie, fall flat.
By trying to appeal to everyone, the movie
will end up appealing to no one.

The "quirkily dysfunctional fam-
ily" sitcom sub-genre has carved
out a comfortable
niche for itself
in recent years,
with shows like MOdem
"Arrested Devel-
opment" and Family
"Malcolm in the W
Middle" milking Wednesdays
generous come-
dic mileage from ABC
the unique com-
bination of disdain and affection
that most people have toward their
families. There's a similar vein of
thought at work in ABC's "Modern
Family," which deftly takes after the
genre's best shows while simultane-
ously bringing something new to
the usual formula.
"ModernFamily"revolvesaround
the Pritchetts and their extended
familyincluding father Jay (Ed
O'Neill, "Married...with Children"),
the family of daughter Claire (Julie
Bowen, "Boston Legal") and gay

couple Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Fergu-
son, CBS's "The Class") and Cam-
eron (Eric Stonestreet, "CSI. Crime
Scene Investigation"). The show is
presented in a mockumentary for-
mat similar to "The Office," hopping
between the three families with fre-
quent talking-head interstitials.
It's rare to see a pilot effectively
establish everything it needs, but
already "Modern Family" has a
strongsense ofwhatkind of a show it
wants to be. Comedically, it's firmly
in the mold of shows like "30 Rock"
and "The Office."Uponbeingroman-
tically turned down by a female
employee at the mall, 11-year-old
Manny (Rico Rodriguez II, "Cory in
the House") laments: "I gave her my
heart and she gave me a picture of
myself as an old-time sheriff."
The structure of "Modern Fam-
ily" helps this deliberate comedic
pace considerably. The show offers
character-centric humor with a shift
toward farce: A highlight of the pilot
has Claire's husband Phil (Ty Bur-
rell, "Back To You"), while teaching
his son about the danger of BB guns,
accidentally shoot his son, his daugh-

ter's boyfriend and himself: The.
mockumentary format lets the show
d ole out-its jokes at a-relayed pace.
Compared to any typical multi-
camera sitcom, the show is comfort-
able enough in its sensibilities that it
doesn't feel the need to beat viewers
over the head with its jokes, which
helps the show carry its comedic
load immensely.
Likewise, its writing and ensem-
ble cast help bring all these facets
together. The show avoids making
Milking mileage
from disdain.
the Pritchetts into just an assem-
bled bundle of quirks and neuro-
ses, fleshing out their characters to
varying degrees.
Burrell is a particular standout,
playing Phil - the "cool" dad in all
the wrong ways - with the right
touches ofobliviousness and desper-
ation. (On his hipness, Phil remarks:

"I surf the Web, I text - LOL, laugh
out loud, OMG, oh my god, WTF,
why the face.")
Elsewhere, the character devel-
opment's a bit rougher: Jay and
second wife Gloria (Sofia Vergara,
"The Knights of Prosperity") feel
more broadly drawn than the rest
of the cast, with Vergara playing the
opposing "fiery Latina" stereotype
to O'Neill's sad-sack grandfather.
For the most part though, whether
it's Mitchell's continued exaspera-
tion with his family's disapproval or
Claire worrying about her daughter
retracing her own steps as a wild
teenager, the writing more than
supports the show's ambitions.
In a fall season marked more
by tired retreadding over famil-
iar themes than anything else, it's
encouraging to find in "Modern
Family" a show that wants to do
more than just meet expectations.
Its variations on the genre aren't
necessarily revelatory, but the
show's hearty premise, excellent
writing and solid ensemble cast eas-
ily make it one of the best freshman
outings this season.

listening to it is an absolute plea-
sure. With the album more about
experimentation than crystalli-
zation, Q-Tip is in peak chame-
leonic form here, jumping from
Nutella-smooth R&B hoo-hooing
("Blue Girl") to straight-up Stevie
Wonder-styled pop ("Barely In
Love"). He even sneaks in "Car-
ing," an earnest two-minute lul-
laby that wouldn't feel out of
place at the epilogue of a Disney
musical. And most of this works
because the man can sing, a god-
send that rescues the album from
overindulgence.
The only real clunker is
"Heels," a hard-pounding rhinoc-
eros stomp about girls who look
1 good "closed or open toe." While
packing its fair share of clever
rhymes, its eye-rolling refrain
of "Real heel / High heel" feels
like a dead joke against the blunt,
bottom-heavy acoustics, which
clash clumsily with the rest of the
album's cosmic arrangements.
Kamaal takes Tribe's flirta-
tions with jazz to a new level,

Kurt Rosenwinkel to flesh out

netic flow, his rapping is still
sorely missed. Lyrics like, "Did
you write the hit? / Did you hit
the bong? / Even if you did it with
your friend under covers / it's
you," are cryptic, even for The
Abstract (the rapper's alter-ego).
And while rapping is the perfect
outlet for Q-Tip's free associa-
tions, his frequent R&B vibing on
Kamaal leaves his abstractions
feeling a little, erm, abstract.
And the lyrics on "Barely In
Love" are surprisingly vapid:
"$500 in the bank / things are
looking bad / Imagine if we gotta
eat / well things are looking sad."
Warts and all, Kamaal the
Abstract is certainly one of the
most intriguing hip-hop releases
of the year. And with music this
tastefully adventurous, it's hard
not to write these critiques off as
pseudo-critiques and simply let
Q-Tip swab your jaded ears.

Suspect of NYC
terrorism plot
pleads not guilty

RE-SHAPING THE PAST

Official says planned
terror scheme 'has
been broken up'
NEW YORK (AP) - As a sus-
pected al-Qaida operative pleaded
not guilty yesterday to plotting a
bomb attack in New York, the city's
police commissioner pronounced
the threat neutralized and said
there is nothing to fear from the
defendant's three alleged accom-
plices.
The terror scheme "has been
broken up," said Police Commis-
sioner Raymond Kelly. "I see no
danger emanating ... from the peo-
ple involved in this investigation."
He would not elaborate, and
police and federal investigators
have repeatedly refused to discuss
the whereabouts of the three peo-
ple who are alleged to have helped
Afghan immigrant Najibullah Zazi
buy beauty supplies for use in brew-
ingup explosives.
But former federal prosecutor
Harry Sandick said the investiga-
tors' silence might mean the accom-
plices have left the country or are
already secretly cooperating.
"One would think they're in cus-
tody or likely to be in custody soon,"
Sandick said.
r Police also said there are no
extra security measures in place in
subways or elsewhere in New York
because of the alleged plot.
Zazi, 24, is the only suspect pub-
licly identified so far in what Assis-
tant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Knox
called a conspiracy that was "inter-
national in scope." Prosecutors said
Zazi received al-Qaida explosives
training in Pakistan last year and
may have intended to carry out his
attack on the anniversary of 9/11.
After his return to the U.S.,
authorities said, three people trav-
eled from New York City to subur-
ban Denver over the summer and
used stolen credit cards to help Zazi
buy products containing hydrogen
peroxide and acetone - common

ingredients for homemade bombs.
Authorities said the three returned
to New York at some point.
Zazi, heavily bearded and wear-
ingabluejailsmock,neverspoke and
showed no emotion as his lawyer
entered a not guilty pleato conspira-
cy in a Brooklyn courtroom guarded
by a team of deputy marshals. He
was ordered held without bail.
"You get the impression he's
a nice guy, don't you?" defense
attorney Michael Dowling said to
reporters afterward.
Dowling acknowledged that the
Denver airport shuttle driver visit-
ed Pakistan lastnyear and made pur-
chases earlier this year at a beauty
supply shop in Aurora, Colo. But he
added, "Those acts are not illegal"
and cautioned against a "rush to
judgment."
Asked about possible accomplic-
es, the lawyer said: "I don't know
the names of anybody else that
allegedly conspired with Mr. Zazi.
... Those names have not been pro-
duced."
Investigators said Zazi urgently
tried to mix up explosives in a Col-
orado hotel room in early Septem-
ber, and then drove to New York to
carry out an attack, perhaps on the
New York transit system.
The FBI was listening in and
becoming increasingly concerned
as the anniversary of the Sept.
11, 2001, attacks and a New York
visit by President Barack Obama
approached, officials said. On Sept.
10, investigators secretly searched
Zazi's rented vehicle in New York
and found a laptop computer with
bomb-making instructions, author-
ities said.
Zazi, fearing he was being
watched, flew back to Denver on
Sept. 12, authorities said. He was
arrested a week later.
Prosecutors said Tuesday that
the Zazi case involves classified
evidence, and that his lawyer and
other participants would have to
get security clearances to look at it.
Zazi's next court date was set for
Dec. 3.

U.S.: No 'snap' decisions on Iran

Six-nation talks with
Iran to take place
Thurs. in Geneva
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Obama administration, while
skeptical of an early breakthrough
in nuclear talks with Iran, indicat-
ed yesterday it does not intend to
swiftly press for stiffer economic
sanctions.
In advance of six-nation talks
with Iran on tomorrow in Geneva,
the State Department stressed its
hope that the session would open
the door to more in-depth dialogue
about ways Iran could alleviate
concerns that its emerging nuclear
program may be secretly develop-
ing nuclear weapons.
If Iran is willing to address the
nuclear issues, then there likely

will be subsequent meetings, State
Department spokesman P.J. Crow-
ley said.
"That process will take some
time," Crowley said. "We're not
going to make a snap judgment on
Thursday. We're going to see how
that meeting goes, evaluate the
willingness of Iran to engage on
these issues."
Crowley noted that President
Barack Obama has said he intends
to take a few months to assess
Iran's position and consult with
U.S. negotiating partners before
deciding what next steps to take.
In the meantime, the admin-
istration is already developing a
sanctions plan that could target
Iran's energy, financial and tele-
communications sectors if Iran
does not comply with international
demands to clarify its nuclear pro-
gram.

Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., chairman of the Senate
banking committee, said yesterday
he will push legislation to expand
Obama's authority to sanction Iran,
with a focus on a range of financial
institutions and businesses. Dodd
said his bill also would extend U.S.
sanctions to oil and gas pipelines
and tankers.
Dodd said the proposed extra
sanctions could be imposed if
Iran does not respond to "our final
diplomatic effort in the coming
weeks." He said he has consulted
with administration officials about
sanctions possibilities and decided
that Iran's energy industry - a key
source of Iranian government rev-
enue - is particularly vulnerable.
Dodd said his bill will include
a set of incentives for countries to
tighten their export control sys-
tems to stop the illegal diversion

of sensitive technologies to coun-
tries like Iran, and to impose new
licensing requirements on those
who refuse to cooperate. The bill
also would impose a broad ban on
direct U.S. imports from Iran and
U.S. exports to Iran, with exemp-
tions for food and medicine.
Attending yesterday's meeting
will be representatives of the U.S.,
Russia, China, Britain, France and
Germany, as well as Iran. William
Burns, the undersecretary of state
for political affairs, will lead the
U.S. delegation. The talks will be
run by Javier Solana, the European
Union's foreign policy chief.
In what could be interpreted as a
gesture linked to the Geneva talks,
Iran on yesterday permitted Swiss
diplomats to visit three Ameri-
cans who have been detained at an
undisclosed location since crossing
into Iran from Iraq in late July.

Officials: Standis SUMMER CLASSES

could still house
Gitmo inmates

Northern Michigan
prison could hold up
to 600 inmates
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -
Federal and state officials said Mon-
day that a state prison in Michigan
is still being considered to house
Guantanamo Bay inmates, but a
local congressman said Pentagon
officials told him it was no longer in
the running.
Gov. Jennifer Granholm's office
and Rep. Bart Stupak, whose dis-
trict includes the Standish Maxi-
mum Correctional Facility, said it
remained on the list of lockups to
which the 229 terrorism suspects
might be transferred.
"We've been talking continu-
ously to the White House and they
have let us know that no deci-
sions have been made," Granholm
spokeswoman Megan Brown said.
The governor's office was briefed
on the situation by Obama officials
Monday, Brown said.
AnObamaadministrationofficial
also said nothing had been decided
and "multiple options" were being
considered.
Rep. Peter Hoekstra, senior

RIDE-SHARING WEBSITE
PRESENTED TO MSA
SonyaSuter, astudentrepresenta-
tive from Zimride, a newlylaunched
ride-sharing website, explained the
goals of the website and its benefits
to University students.
. Zimride, which was launched
for college students in late July, al-
lows users to create a profile and
post their desired destinations. The
website will match passengers with
a driver going to the same destina-
tion or going through the passen-
ger's destination.
"Their goal is to branch out and
create social networks for ride-
sharing in various communities
across the country," Suter said.
The website makes it easier for
students to coordinate carpooling,

Republican on the House Intel-
ligence Committee, said Penta-
gon officials recently told him the
Standish prison was off the table.
But he said he was waiting for con-
firmation from the administration.
"I'm pretty confident in our
sources," Hoekstra told The Asso-
ciated Press. "But this is one where
before I declare victory, I want it in
black and white."
President Barack Obama has
pledged to close the U.S. military
prison in Cuba by January, but
administration officials acknowl-
edged lastweek the deadline might
not be met. Among issues still to
be resolved is where to send the
detainees.
Among possible locations are
the Standish prison, which has the
capacity to hold 600 inmates, and
the military penitentiary at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., officials have
said.
Hoekstra, who is seeking the
GOP nomination for governornext
year, is an outspoken opponent of
closing the Guantanamo prison
and transferring its inmates to
U.S. soil.
"We spent hundreds of millions
of dollars building that place," he
said. "There's no reason to close it."
which can save money and is better
for the environment, Suter said.
Registration for the University of
Michigan network of the Zimride
website requires a University e-mail
address.
Zimride has partnered with the
Athletic Department to encourage
students to use the website to find
rides to away athletic events.
Suter emphasized that keeping
the ride connections within the
Michigan community helps ensure
the safety of its users. Users have
the option of hiding the exact ad-
dress of their destinations from oth-
ers as well.
Zimride is connected to Face-
book, allowing users to look for
mutual friends or just generally get
more information about someone
before agreeing to ride with them.
The company also has a partnership
with Zipcar, a national car-sharing
service through which users can
rent cars by the hour.

LSAsophomores Steven Colvin
and Brad and Jeff Lankowsky all
enrolled in spring term courses.
They all cited the ease of getting
required credits out of the way
for their majors during the spring
as the main reason they stayed
for the summer.
Colvin and Masotta both noted
they did not see the advertise-
ments for new spring and sum-
mer term classes.
Peraino wrote in an e-mail
last spring that many of the new
courses were in Screen Arts &
Culture, Biology, Communica-
tion Studies and Chemistry.
According to recent list from

Peraino, new classes were also
offered in Political Science, Psy-
chology, History and American
Culture. Some of these classes
were offered for the first time in
four years.
The other major, more obvious
reason for the increased enroll-
ment in summer offerings from
the University was the tough job
market in the middle of a nation-
al economic downturn - limiting
the number of summer job oppor-
tunities and leaving students
with fewer alternatives to stay-
ing in school for the summer.
According' to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, from April
to July 2009, the number of
employed youth16to 24 years old
increased by 1.6 million to 19.3
million.

However, the percentage of
people in that age group who
were employed in July was just
5.4 percent - the lowest July
rate on record for the Bureau's
series, which began in 1948.
With all of these reasons
in mind, University officials
are planning to maintain their
increased emphasis on spring
and summer offerings.
"We're hoping to do better
next year," Peraino wrote. "Our
plan is to offer virtually the same
classes, with an eye toward a reg-
ular, dependable curriculum."
The University recently sent a
survey to LSA students who were
not enrolled for either spring or
summer term, with the purpose
of gaining insight from those
students about how to improve

course offerings.
The survey is still being con-
ducted, Peraino wrote, but will is
expected to end today. After LSA
receives all of the survey results,
Peraino expects a new plan for
spring and summer term classes
to be released within a couple of
weeks.
While many students took
advantage of the newly offered
courses, Sullivan said she hopes
the number of credit hours con-
tinues to increase in years to
come, noting that this new strat-
egy of offering core courses could
help incoming freshmen.
"(Freshmen) really couldn't do
that last year because we didn't
have our act together in time to
let them know about it," she said.
"Now we will."

Michigan Student Assembly
LGBT Commission Chair Chris
Armstrong said he was shocked
the Blind Pig would host such a
performer.
"I think that he has clearly very
prejudiced lyrics and perspec-
tives," he said. "And I think he uses
his performances to broadcast
them."
Armstrong said he was particu-
larly upset because the Blind Pig
has had such a good relationship
with the LGBT community in the
past, hosting a number of events
for the group over the years.
"The Blind Pig has a really good
record of supporting the queer
community," Spectrum Center

struct fences and use water sprays

project came in part from the Build
America Bond program, which was
included in the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
"Thisbondprogramwasdesigned
to encourage big construction proj-
ects like this as a way of generating
jobs," according to the DDA's web-
site. The interest rate for the bond is
3.81 percent, essentially saving the
city approximately $22 million.
Ramlawi, however, feels that his
business, which was founded in
AssistantDirectorGabeJaviersaid.
"People are definitely shocked, and
they're really disappointed."
Javier said he first heard about
the show at the Blind Pig after he
received an e-mail from the Tri-
angle Foundation informing him
of its efforts to stop the show at the
Majestic Theatre.
After hearing that the Blind Pig
was hosting the controversial per-
former - who Javier said he had
heard of a few times before but
didn't know much about - Javier
helped spread the word about the
event, asking LGBT community
members and others to call the
Blind Pig and ask it to cancel the
show.
Wood said the Blind Pig had
received a call about the event
"every minute or two" since early
in the afternoon yesterday. When
asked to estimate the total number,
Wood suggested it was somewhere
around 200 to 300 calls.
"I'm thrilled that the commu-
nity is that active," she said. "I just
really feel that the energies could
be spent more productively."
Wood said Banton has played
in the Blind Pig before, as recently

1987, has been overlooked by the city
throughout the planningstages.
"(The DDA) has not communi-
cated when or how (the construc-
tion) will happen, and we learnjust
like everyone else does - through
the newspapers," Ramlawi said.
"They never asked for our concern
or our opinions."
"In this city's attempt to attract
industry," he added, "they've for-
gotten the businesses that are
already here."
According to Ramlawi, struc-
tural damage to his building is
as 2005, and that the venue has
"never had any problems."
When told about Banton sign-
ing the Reggae Compassionate Act
of 2007, Armstrong said he was
doubtful of the performer's intent.
"For any LGBT individual, it's
really hard for them to necessar-
ily think that anything has really
changed," Armstrong said.
Javier said he doesn't think
Banton's shows would have been
canceled across the country if he
stopped promotingviolence.
of the 36 shows originally
scheduled for Banton's 2009 tour,
15 have been canceled in cities like
Chicago, San Francisco, Colum-
bus, Los Angeles and Dallas. Five
concerts have recently been added,
including the Ann Arbor show, to
fill out the schedule after the other
cancellations.
Members of the LGBT commu-
nity said yesterday that if the con-
cert weren't canceled, there would
likely be a protest at the Blind Pig
tonight.
"I am concerned and it pains
my heart to think that (the LGBT
community) feels that I am doing
something wrong or I am support-

inevitable because the sidewalks
will be torn up and the water sup-
ply, an essential component of run-
ning a restaurant, will be cut off
while the water mains are built.
AnnArbor.com reported last
week that Ramlawi and the owner
of Herb David filed alawsuit against
the city. Ramlawi said, however,
that he "only filed a complaint."
"We haven't sued yet because
there hasn't been a loss," he said.
"However, if we face structural
damage or significant loss of busi-
ness,we will."
ing something that is dangerous or
anti-gay," Wood said. "That very
personally bothers all of the staff
now, but at the same time we have
convictions that we have to stand
by.
"This is the Blind Pig, it's impor-
tant tous, and I think that he's not
advocating death and violence,"
she said. "I don't see any reason
that I shouldn't."
When told of the likely protest,
Wood said she hoped it would be a
peaceful one.
"That's the most I canhope," she
said. "I want people to feel heard. I
just really wish that people knew
- knew what they were talking
about before they got their panties
in a bundle."
Above all, Armstrong and other
members of the LGBT community
are, quite simply, surprised.
"I'm more than anything
stunned at a place like the Blind
Pig, considering the role that
they've played in the past (for the
LGBT community)," he said. "I
think that personally it's just sort
of a little bit sobering, knowing
the fact that I've been going there
since I was a freshman."

if you're a spread team, you're not is greater than or equal to the num-
as physical," Rodriguez said at his ber of total offensive touchdowns
Monday press conference. "Being put up by five conference counter-

parts: Ohio State, Indiana, Iowa,
Minnesota and Illinois.
"If you run for 350 yards or
400 yards in the spread offense,
you have to be a little bit physical
at some point," Rodriguez said.
"That part is probably played up
too much. I don't think it's the style
of play. But there is no question, in
this game, the physicality of both
teams."
But once again, with his team
traveling to East Lansing this week-
end, Rodriguez was questioned
about his team's toughness.
That'sbecausethe Spartans have
garnered the reputation of being a
very physical team since Michigan
State coach Mark Dantonio strolled
onto campus three seasons ago.
Last year, on the legs of Javon
Ringer, the Spartans were one of
the most physical, ground-churn-
ing teams in the Big Ten, if not the
nation. But Rodriguez doesn't want

to focus on the toughness of Michi-
gan State, but of the intensity of the
conference as a whole.
"Wetrytopreach the importance
of the Big Ten games in particular,
how intense they are," Rodriguez
said. "Some of the schools in the Big
Ten, if you ask them, they may tell
you their biggest game is against
Michigan."
On the defensive side of the ball,
the Spartans are giving up a scant
113 yards per game on the ground,
which means hard-nosed football
is going to be the key to the Wolver-
ines' offensive success this week-
end and in the future.
"We've played pretty physical at
times this year, but we're going to
challenge our guys this week to be
more physical, and not just because
we're playing Michigan State,"
Rodriguez said. "We're doing it
because I think we can play more
physical."

Since Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio's first season in 2007, there has been no love lost between the
Wolverines and Spartans.
You probably remember Mike Hart's infamous "Little Brother" comment - and Dantonio making fun of Hart's
height in response - but there are plenty of chalkboard-worthy quotes for both sides from the last few years, including
some pretty startling quips from a few Spartans at yesterday's press conference. Needless to say, this annual in-state

Michigan defensive end Brandon Graham before the 2008 Mich

defensive end Trev-

I realized why I didn't like them. Just
the total lack of respect that they have
for our school in general. Not just the
program, but the general lack of respect
they have for us."
quarterback Kirk
Cousins: "This game is personal, and we
need to win it. And we better win it."

Cironi: "Yeah, I think everybody has a
hatred for Michigan."

Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez:
"I'm friendly with everybody ... I'm a
nice guy. I'm closer with some other
coaches. (Dantonio andI) don't share tea
and crumpets ... we don't trade text mes-

Michigan cornerback Donovan
Warren: "This past year (in January)
I was going back home and I was at
the airport and a guy - I had nothing
Michigan on - but the guy just came
up to me and said, 'We're gonna beat
your ass this year again.' I said, 'What?'
He's like, 'Yeah, those Wolverines, we're
going to give it to you this year again.' I
said, All right, all right, sir.' "
