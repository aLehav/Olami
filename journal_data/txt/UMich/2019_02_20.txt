Amid 
objections 
from 
community 
activists, 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 
moved 
forward 
Tuesday 
with 
a 
proposed amendment to allow 
for a waiver of restrictions on 
the eligibility of city employees 
to sit on the police oversight 
commission. The amendment 
will be addressed at a second 
reading during the next council 
meeting. 
The 2014 shooting of Aura 
Rosser by an Ann Arbor Police 
officer provoked months of 
debate and protest, eventually 

sparking interest in the creation 
of a police oversight committee. 
The 
council 
unanimously 
passed a resolution in October 
to establish an independent 
police oversight committee. 
Councilmember 
Julie 
Grand, D-Ward 3, attempted 
to clarify the intent of the 
amendment, 
explaining 
the 
amendment would not apply to 
police officers or current city 
employees. 
“There was a misperception 
about the ordinance coming 
forward,” Grand said. “I know 
with any new process there will 
be some bumps along the way. 
This was a bump that we made 
sure was corrected.”

On Tuesday night, The 
Quito Project held a workshop 
titled “Breaking the Barriers 
of Voluntourism: Engaging 
in 
Sustainable 
Cultural 
Humility 
Practices,” 
discussing the impact of 
voluntourism: a combination 
of tourism and volunteer 
work abroad. The workshop 
touched on the challenges 
of international volunteer 
work, which, according to the 
organizers, can sometimes 
be unsustainable and harm 
the communities it aims to 
help. 

LSA 
senior 
Nora 
Kuo, 
Quito Project co-President, 
introduced 
the 
event 
by 
explaining how volunteers 
can 
unintentionally 
harm 
the communities with which 
they work. 
“We want to learn how to 
volunteer 
abroad 
without 
coming 
in 
with 
harmful 
behavior that is disrespecting 
the community,” Kuo said.
Kuo said The Quito Project, 
a student organization based 
in Quito, Ecuador that works 
to minimize the achievement 
gap 
for 
primary 
school 
students 
in 
low-income 
areas, 
started 
holding 

these workshops when they 
noticed 
their 
Michigan 
tutors 
weren’t 
achieving 
what they had hoped.
“There was a disconnect 
between what we wanted to 
do and what was happening,” 
she said.
Danyelle J. Reynolds, the 
assistant director for student 
learning and leadership for 
the Ginsberg Center, led 
the workshop portion of the 
event, beginning by asking 
the audience if they had any 
preconceived definitions of 
voluntourism.
The 
responses 
of 
the 
audience 
were 
mixed, 

leading into Reynolds’ next 
point. She explained though 
the word often holds negative 
connotations, she said she 
believes voluntourism is not 
inherently good or bad.
“There isn’t a consensus 
for 
what 
voluntourism 
means,” Reynolds said. “It’s 
all about what you’re actually 
doing.”
She noted one of the 
obstacles 
for 
volunteers 
was not knowing why they 
wanted to volunteer. This 
often impacts how volunteers 
eventually 
approach 
their 
work, Reynolds said. 

Sean 
Donahue, 
a 
lawyer 
whose 
focus 
area 
includes 
environmental 
litigation, 
discussed the President Donald 
Trump’s administration’s efforts 
to deregulate key environmental 
policies at Hutchins Hall on 
Tuesday. The talk was organized 
for The Environmental Law 
and Policy Program Lecture 
Series put on by the University of 
Michigan Law School.
Donahue’s 
firm, 
Donahue, 
Goldberg & Weaver, LLP, based 
in Washington D.C., focuses on 
Constitutional, 
environmental 
and civil rights litigation. 
Environmental 
policy 
deregulation under the Trump 
administration 
has 
been 
a 
controversial 
and 
prevalent 
initiative, 
Donahue 
said. 
Trump promised to decrease 
environmental regulations and 
promote coal and industrial 
energy during his campaign. 
Donahue compared the Trump 
administration’s 
efforts 
to 
cut regulations to the French 
Revolution, saying it was similar 
to the beginning of a new regime.

At the University of Michigan 
Central 
Student 
Government 
meeting 
Tuesday 
night, 
students, faculty and community 
members 
came 
together 
to 
discuss a resolution opposing 

the 
University’s 
new 
felony 
notification policy, which has 
spurred controversy on campus 
over the past month. Guest 
speakers 
also 
discussed 
the 
One

Campaign, 
a 
coalition working to make all 
three University campuses more 
equitable.

The University implemented 
an 
amendment 
requiring 
faculty, staff, student employees, 
volunteers and visiting scholars 
to provide notification if they are 
charged with or convicted of a 
felony crime. They must notify the 
University within one week of a 
charge or conviction occurring on 

or after Feb. 1, 2019.
Once the University is notified, 
University Human Resources will 
process each post-employment 
case using a process similar to the

DARBY STIPE/Daily
Danyelle J. Reynolds, Assistant Director for Student Learning and Leadership at the Ginsberg Center, speaks about responsible Voluntourism abroad in North 
Quad Tuesday.


The 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
Agriculture is awarding “The Ann 
Arbor Greenbelt: Saving Michigan 
Farms 
Regional 
Conservation 
Partnership Program” $1 million 
dollars, according to a Feb. 4 press 
release. The project is led by the 
City of Ann Arbor Open Space and 
Parkland Preservation Program, 
also called the Greenbelt. It aims 
to 
protect 
surrounding 
Ann 

Arbor agricultural lands through 
conservation easements, the right 
to use someone else’s land for a 
specified purpose. Greenbelt and 
its local partners will match the 
grant, which means a total of $2 
million will go toward preserving 
farmland in Washtenaw County.
Partners in the project include 
Washtenaw County Parks and 
Recreation 
Commission, 
Scio 
Township, Ann Arbor Township, 
Augusta 
Township, 
Legacy 
Land 
Conservancy, 
Southeast 

Michigan Land Conservancy, The 
Conservation Fund and the USDA 
Natural Resources Conservation 
Service.
This 2018 fiscal year, the 
Saving Michigan Farms program 
is one of 91 projects selected 
for the Regional Conservation 
Partnership 
Program 
funding 
by the USDA Natural Resources 
Conservation Service. The USDA 
list of chosen projects describes 
ecological 
and 
local 
benefits 
of the Saving Michigan Farms 
program. These benefits include 
protecting food security and 
local economics, maintaining 
the 
agricultural 
heritage 
of residents and combating 
environmental concerns.
According 
to 
Jennifer 
Fike, the Greenbelt Advisory 
Commission 
chair, 
the 
USDA grant will amplify the 
Greenbelt’s land preservation 
efforts.
“(The grant money) is an 
awesome way for us to leverage 
federal dollars to match the 
amount of money that we put 
in to protect land in Washtenaw 
County in the Greenbelt area,” 
Fike said. “It allows our (tax) 
dollars to go further to protect 
more land.”
According 
to 
the 
USDA 
website, 
the 
RCPP 
funds 
projects through four types 
of programs, including from 
the Agricultural Conservation 
Easement Program. Though the 
Greenbelt has received USDA 
funding directly from ACEP 
before, this is the first time 
Greenbelt has received such 
funding through the RCPP, Fike 
explained.

“It could potentially allow us 
to go after larger parcels of land,” 
Fike said. “I’m not sure, as (both 
types of funding) are very similar. 
It just allows us more funding — 
one million dollars — whereas 
ACEP funding is a lot less.”
The Saving Michigan Farms 
program will preserve agricultural 
lands 
by 
functioning 
as 
a 
Purchase of Development Rights 
program, a voluntary program 
for which landowners can apply. 
Owners of qualified agricultural 
property are compensated for 
accepting 
a 
permanent 
deed 
restriction through a conservation 
easement, which prohibits future 
development on that land. The 
land remains private property, and 
the landowner may receive income 
tax benefits for donating part or all 
of the value of development rights.
To 
LSA 
freshman 
Noah 
Clements, who is a student in the 
Program in the Environment, PDR 
programs are especially beneficial 
for their long-term effects.
“Conservation 
easements, 
like Greenbelt is doing, are really 
sustainable, and they keep that 
land undeveloped for decades to 
come,” Clements said. “It really is 
a future-minded project, which is 
what we need.”
According to the Greenbelt 
website, PDR programs benefit 
farmers in a variety of ways, such 
as 
rendering 
farmland 
more 
affordable, which helps younger 
farmers; gives older farmers a 
way other than selling their land 
to fund retirement; and assists 
in the transfer of farmland from 
generation to generation. Fike 
echoed these points, expressing 
that PDR programs can help 

CAFE SHAPIRO

ON THE DAILY: ‘U’ BAN ON FACULTY-STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS IN PLACE 

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: CARTER, STUDENTS DISCUSS 
DRAFT. MSA’S ALLAND GOES TO D.C.

A new University policy took 
effect on Monday prohibiting sexual, 
romantic, 
amorous 
and 
dating 
relationships between faculty and 
undergraduate students in for all three 
University of Michigan campuses.
The policy is part of significant 
revisions to University procedure 
on faculty-student relationships that 
came after a working group, consisting 
of faculty from all three campuses, 
made recommendations to University 
President Mark Schlissel. 

The 
policy, 
which 
prohibits 
relationships between “teachers” and 
“learners,” bans relationships between 
faculty, graduate student instructors 
and undergraduates responsible for the 
delivery of course content with students 
they have academic or supervisory 
authority over, including in class, labs, 
online, field or other settings. 
Graduate 
and 
professional 
students are also banned from having 
relationships with faculty members 
inside their discipline or academic 
program, in which the faculty member 
has or might reasonably be expected to 
have academic or supervisory authority.

Supervised and non-supervised 
postdoctoral research fellows may not 
engage in relationships with faculty 
members in cases where they have had 
or might be expected to have academic 
or supervisory authority as well. 
University Provost Martin Philbert 
told the University Record that helping 
students advance as learners should be 
the primary mission of all educators at 
the University. 
“Maintenance of an environment 
of trust, openness, civility and respect 
that enables each person to reach 
their full potential is at the core of our 
mission as educators at the University of 

Michigan,” University Provost Martin 
Philbert said. “It is incumbent on our 
faculty to nurture the advancement and 
pursuit of knowledge, which result in 
lifelong professional mentorships and 
service to our society.”
According to an email sent to 
the Ford School of Public Policy, the 
Public Policy school will consider rare 
exceptions. Requests for exceptions 
must be made in writing by the faculty 
member, GSI or other teachers.
This policy applies to the University’s 
Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint 
campuses.

Feb. 19, 1980
President Carter and National 
Security 
Advisor 
Zbigniew 
Brzezinski met with 300 student 
leaders from across the country 
- including Michigan Student 
Assembly (MSA) President Jim 
Alland - in Washington Friday to 
discuss the reinstatement of draft 
registration.
Both Carter and Brzezinski 

reaffirmed that the proposal now 
before Congress is a necessary 
step 
to 
protect 
American 
interests abroad, Alland said in 
an interview yesterday.
“The overriding concern at the 
conference was the registration,” 
Alland said. “It’s hard to know 
what a meeting like this will do, 
however, it’s always to express 
views.” He described his own 

feelings on registration as “very 
mixed.” 
Campaign workers for Sen. 
Edward 
Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) 
invited the visiting students 
to a reception at Kennedy’s 
Washington headquarters, but 
All And said he did not attend it.
He 
added 
that 
students 
expressed concern that they were 
being used as political pawns. 

“To say that it was not a 
political move (on Carter’s part) 
would be nothing, less than 
naive,” he said. 
Alland, however, said he felt 
the president was “very sincere” 
in his desire to hear student 
response to foreign policy. “I 
really got the feeling that they 
wanted to hear what the mood 
was across the nation.”

Ann Arbor project awarded $1 million 
grant from US Department of Agriculture

Initiative to save Michigan farms chosen to receive funding from USDA

landowners in their present-day 
business operations as well.
“Land prices in Washtenaw 
County can be pretty high,” Fike 
said. “(It can be) very difficult 
financially to make a living at 
(farming). By being able to place 
land in a conservation easement 
with us as a partner, that allows 
(farmers) the financial capability 
to put the money back into their 
business and grow food for local 
markets, such as Ann Arbor 
Farmers Market, selling to Ann 
Arbor restaurants, selling directly 
off their farm.”
The Greenbelt arose out of the 
2003 Open Space and Parkland 
Preservation Millage, a 30-year, 
0.5 mil tax levy in response to 
the worries of suburban sprawl 
in Ann Arbor in the 1990s. More 
commonly known as the Greenbelt 
Millage, the measure passed with 
two-thirds of the vote.
Michael Garfield, director of 
environmental advocacy group 
known as the Ecology Center, 
spearheaded 
the 
Greenbelt 

ballot measure in 2003. Garfield 
explained the context in which the 
measure arose, describing rapid 
development in the 1980s and 
1990s.
“Back in the 1980s and ’90s, 
there was unplanned, unrestrained 
suburban development in all of 
southeast Michigan … quite a 
distance from the urban center 
of Detroit,” Garfield said. “There 
were ginormous (sic) developments 
in Washtenaw County fairly close 
to Ann Arbor that were being 
proposed 
that 
would 
utterly 
transform the landscape around 
here … We were concerned about 
the loss of natural resources, and 
loss of good farmland that could 
be used to build a sustainable food 
economy.”
Garfield 
also 
described 
unrestrictive development laws, 
which made control of suburban 
sprawl difficult.

According to the website, when 
going over each case, HR will 
focus on the nature and gravity 
of the offense, the timeliness 
and accuracy of the disclosure 
and the relevancy to the role 
held at the University.
HR’s statement explains the 
policy is meant to preserve a 
safe University community.
“Information about a faculty 
or staff member’s criminal 
activity helps the University 
maintain a safe community and 
prevent putting people at risk of 
harm,” the statement reads.
At the CSG meeting, the 
Carceral 
State 
Project, 
an 
initiative focused on issues 
of 
mass 
incarceration 
and 
immigration 
detention 
in 
Michigan, had representatives 
speak against the University’s 
new policy. In an open letter 
to the University, the Carceral 
State Project describes how 
they believe the policy has 
negative social and economic 
consequences 
for 
those 
on 
campus.
“Taken 
together, 
these 
policies 
promote 
over-
criminalization 
rather 
than 
public safety, reinforce the 
racial and economic inequalities 
in the criminal justice system 
and on our campus and have 
other 
devastating 
collateral 
consequences,” the letter reads.
Community member Patrick 
Bates, who spent 17 years in 
prison, described his personal 
disappointment 
with 
the 
University after hearing about 
the new policy. 
“At a very young age I caught a 

felony, and due to that, I couldn’t 
get any job, I couldn’t get into 
really good schools or anything 
like that …” Bates said. “I’ve 
been trying to better myself and 
I’ve been coming up here three 
times a week from Detroit, and I 
hear about this (the new policy); 
I’m just so appalled about 
what’s going on with this policy 
… I know while I was inside, I 
got an associate’s degree and I 
did everything I could to better 
myself, and I came home and 
the conversation we had was 
for me to come home and come 
to the University of Michigan 
and do the right thing. But, now 
with this policy that’s being 
enforced, what am I supposed 
to do?”
Ashley 
Lucas, 
associate 
professor of theatre and drama, 
also spoke about the new felony 
policy. She described how at last 
Wednesday’s town hall meeting, 
many faculty and staff members 
thanked her for what she and 
others are doing to push back 
against the policy. However, her 
colleagues said they would not 
sign the open letter against the 
new policy due to their fear of 
losing their jobs.
“One of the things that’s 
really frightening about this 
policy is that it has frightened 
so many of the people that 
care about you as students 
on campus,” Lucas said. “So, 
the only reason that I’m here 
tonight is to support the student 
voice … but I’m also here to 
represent the people that told 
me they were too frightened to 
speak.”
CSG Vice President Isabel 
Baer said she heard that the new 

policy was partially created in 
response to faculty who have 
been accused of sexual assault 
charges. If the University chose 
not to implement the policy, 
she asked the proponents of the 
resolution what solutions they 
had to address faculty members 
accused of committing sexual 
assault. 
In response, Public Health 
junior Zoe Gerstle, a member of 
the Prison Creative Arts Project, 
described how she believed the 
University should discuss with 
experts on how to best deal with 
issues of sexual misconduct, 
rather than suggesting this new 
felony notification policy as the 
main solution. 
“It’d be great if they (the 
University) 
consulted 
the 
experts at this university who 
study things like this,” Gerstle 
said. “They could create a policy 
that’s going to be more effective, 
as opposed to just handing 
something down. So we don’t 
necessarily have an answer 
on how to deal with sexual 
misconduct at this University, 
but a great start would be 
opening it up to the community 
forum to see what people have 
to say who are experts on this.”
Shifting 
gears, 
guest 
speakers from 1U discussed the 
drastic disparities among the 
Ann Arbor, Flint and Dearborn 
campuses, 
financially 
and 
demographically. 
According to the group’s 
presentation, the median family 
income for University students 
in Ann Arbor is $154,000, 
compared 
to 
$84,000 
in 
Dearborn and $77,000 in Flint. 
In addition, there is a large gap 

in the percentage of students 
eligible to receive the Federal 
Pell Grant at each campus, a 
grant in which the government 
provides funding for students 
in need of financial support 
for college. According to the 
presenters, in Ann Arbor, 15 
percent of students are eligible 
for the grant, compared to the 
39 percent eligible in Flint, and 
42 percent in Dearborn. 
To resolve these issues, LSA 
junior 
Sharif-Ahmed 
Krabti 
and members of the campaign 
proposed several solutions. One 
was to ask the state to equalize 
funding for all three campuses. 
Another was to encourage the 
University’s Diversity, Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
initiative 
to 
donate funding to the other 
campuses, seeing that out of 
the $85 million funneled into 
the program over the past few 
years, none of the money was 
dedicated toward Dearborn or 
Flint, according to Krabti.
“I think there’s a duty for 
Ann Arbor students here on 
this campus who are closest 
to the administration to really 
speak up the loudest about this 
issue,” Krabti said.
When asked about what 
suggestions the Assembly had 
to promote equality across all 
three campuses, LSA freshman 
Sujin 
Kim, 
CSG 
Ethics 
Committee chair, responded 
by encouraging the group to 
spread awareness of these 
disparities among the student 
body.

Grand 
said 
the 
new 
amendment 
would 
allow 
temporary city employees such 
as election workers to be able 
to sit on the commission. She 
explained the councilmembers 
edited the amendment to be 
more specific. 
“That was an oversight as 
we were trying to write an 
amendment that was slightly 
broader than election workers, 
because we recognized there 
are others in the community,” 
Grand said. “For example, we 
might have a youth applicant 
who is a summer camp worker 
and we don’t want to preclude 
that person from serving on 
the community police oversight 
commission.”
Councilmembers 
Jane 
Lumm, I-Ward 2, and Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, who serve 
as the Council’s liaisons for the 
police oversight commission, 
sponsored 
the 
amendment, 
along with Councilmember Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, and Grand.
Initially, 
the 
amendment 
allowed the council to waive 
the restriction, which requires 
former 
and 
current 
city 
employees to wait a period of 
five years from the end of their 
employment 
until 
they 
are 
eligible to sit on a committee. 
Councilmembers 
altered 
the language to specify the 
restriction waiver applied to 
temporary 
or 
seasonal 
city 
employees who received fewer 
than seven paychecks from the 
city in a year. 
Councilmember Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, said he understood 
residents’ 
concerns 
over 
the 
initial 
language 
of 
the 
amendment posted in the agenda, 
but believes the new amendment 
addresses that concern. 
“I believe that this is more 
narrowly 
tailored 
than 
the 
language in the agenda, and it 
won’t encompass any unintended 
consequences,” Eaton said.
Grand and Lumm addressed 
concerns about the nomination 
process for the police oversight 
committee but were met with 
outbursts 
from 
the 
crowd 
criticizing what they saw as a 
lack of transparency.
Dwight 
Wilson, 
who 
is 
a member of the city’s task 
force for the police oversight 
committee 
and 
the 
Human 
Rights Commission but was 
absent at the council meeting, 
had a statement read for him 
during public comment. Wilson 
urged the council to be as specific 
as possible in their language. 
“Rumor has it that even before 
the independent police oversight 
commission is appointed, forces 
are at work to further weaken it,” 
Wilson wrote in the statement. 
“One assault is an amendment 
that will open the door to city 
employees, 
even 
policemen, 
sitting on the commission.”
Ramlawi 
stated 
he 
was 
satisfied with the language of 
the new amendment, but wished 
there was more trust from 
the community. He asked the 
community for the “space and 
trust” to do their work. 
“There has been obviously a lot 
of suspicion and we’re at a fragile 
state of trust right now with this 
new commission and we should 
respect that and know that,” 
Ramlawi said. “I think none of us 
wish to alter the amendment too 
great or at all until it is sat and 
approved.”
At 
several 
points 
while 
Ramlawi spoke, an audience 
member interrupted, demanding 

to know why the council was 
not being transparent about 
the criteria for being on the 
commission. 
Ramlawi 
said 
the 
qualifications 
for 
the 
commission are outlined in the 
amendment. 
Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 
D-Ward 1, opposed the new 
amendment. He shared concerns 
about any city employee being 
on an independent oversight 
committee 
and 
expressed 
worry 
about 
the 
vagueness 
of the definition of a city 
employee. According to Hayner, 
city councilmembers are not 
considered full-time employees 
of the city. 
“There’s a lot of terms that 
need to be defined,” Hayner said. 
“An independent body should not 
have (employees) from the city 
sitting on it. I would like to see 
this body remain independent.”
Hayner and Councilmembers 
Kathy Griswold, D-Ward 2, and 
Elizabeth Nelson, D-Ward 4, 
voted against the amendment, 
which passed by an 8-3 vote. 
Nelson sponsored her own 
resolution to prohibit “undue 
influence” from members of City 
Council who are not liaisons to 
the police oversight commission 
or the city’s Human Rights 
Commission. She said wanted to 
have an open discussion about the 
implementation of the ordinance 
that laid the groundwork for the 
police 
oversight 
commission, 
noting that even though the 
conversation was “a little bit 
awkward,” 
she 
felt 
strongly 
about having it.
“(The) council was sent a 
legal 
memo 
suggesting 
that 
the wording of my resolution 
is overly restrictive in trying to 
clarify this point,” Nelson said. 
“I really struggled in writing 
this 
resolution 
because 
this 
seems like common sense to 
me that we would not use the 
ordinance in this way or proceed 
with the ordinance in this way. 
I appreciate that all members of 
our community, including city 
staffers, including us members 
of council, are free to volunteer 
an opinion about an applicant 
and share that opinion with any 
of the four liaisons.”
She noted the liaisons had 
a “special role” to play in the 
process 
of 
recommending 
applicants to sit on the police 
oversight commission, but said 
when she complained about who 
would fill those positions, she 
was told the goal was to achieve 
balanced perspectives. Nelson 
challenged Lumm for the liaison 
position in December but failed 
to win the needed majority 
support from the council to take 
the spot. She said she had taken 
that as a cue to stay out of the 
affairs of the councilmembers 
who were designated as liaisons. 
“My 
resolution 
includes 
the 
term 
‘undue 
influence’ 
to describe generally, that at 
this stage in the process, none 
of us, except for those four 
liaisons, should be using our city 
positions to exercise any more or 
less influence than a community 
member could,” Nelson said.
Nelson 
criticized 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
for 
attending some of the liaisons’ 
meetings. 
Taylor 
disputed 
Nelson’s characterization of his 
involvement, noting the time 
constraints on the effort and the 
need to convene a commission 
so the city could get its advice 
before hiring a new chief of 
police.

Fourteen 
companies 
have 
signed 
on, 
including 
large 
grocery distributors such as 
Walmart 
and 
Whole 
Foods 
Market and fast food chains such 
as Burger King, McDonald’s and 
Subway.
While 
the 
resolutions 
discussed by CSG, City Council 
and MUBP are significant, the 
University has not officially 
commented on the situation 
and could still offer Wendy’s 
a vendor spot. In order for a 
restaurant to be considered for 
the vendor spot, the University 
must first extend a bid to the 
restaurant.
In 
recent 
reports, 
Heidi 
Schauer, Wendy’s director of 
corporate 
communications, 
has said that the franchise 
previously at the Union did 
not submit a bid. However, it is 
unclear if the University even 

invited them to do so.
According to Kim Daley, a 
postdoctoral fellow in the School 
of Public Health and student-
activist, it’s still possible the 
University will accept a bid from 
Wendy’s, if a different Wendy’s 
franchise was invited to submit 
a bid. However, it is impossible 
for activists to know as the 
procurement process is secret. 
Daley, 
along 
with 
the 
Washtenaw 
Solidarity 
for 
Farmworkers, will speak at the 
University’s Board of Regents 
meeting on Thurs., Feb. 21 to 
encourage 
the 
University 
to 
officially prohibit Wendy’s from 
procuring a vendor spot until 
the franchise adheres to the Fair 
Food Program.
“We’re very excited and we do 
think this is a win, but we also 
want the president and the regents 
specifically to still make a stand 
and show that the University as 
a whole cares about ethical labor 
practices,” Daley said.

“Thinking about your overall 
purpose 
is 
really 
important 
because the ‘why’ shapes the 
‘how,’” Reynolds said. “What 
work are you doing and why are 
you doing it?”
Another 
barrier 
Reynolds 
mentioned was how international 
volunteers might have a difficult 
time understanding the context 
of a problem they are trying to 
solve. Her advice to volunteers 
was to research the history of a 
problem before arriving.
“We have to understand issues 
and know the root causes of the 
issues,” Reynolds said. “If we 
don’t know the root causes, our 
work is not going to be effective 
or sustainable for the community 
we’re working in.”
The third barrier Reynolds 
discussed 
was 
about 
the 
importance 
with 
which 
volunteers 
consider 
their 

identities 
and 
roles. 
She 
prompted the audience to think 
about how their identities would 
affect their experience in the 
specific countries where they are 
volunteering.
“Identities matter,” Reynolds 
said. “Our social identities affect 
how we shape the world around 
us. Whatever you are doing, if 
you are working with people, you 
are in a social environment.”
She 
also 
discouraged 
the 
audience 
from 
ignoring 
opportunities for mutual learning 
and benefit. Reynolds said in 
many cases, those going abroad 
to volunteer will benefit more 
than the communities they’re 
visiting. To reduce this disparity, 
she suggested volunteers think 
about what they can learn from 
community members and to 
try to understand all parts of a 
culture.
“Ask people, ‘What do you 
want and what do you need 
— what are your priorities?’” 

Reynolds said. “If you’re going 
to a place just to help people, 
you’re not seeing the rich, lively, 
positive pieces of the culture that 
are there as well.”
To conclude her presentation, 
Reynolds discussed volunteers’ 
problematic use of social media. 
As an example, she brought up 
the commonly posted photos of 
University of Michigan students 
in a foreign country with a maize 
and blue block ‘M’ flag, and how 
most people have not considered 
the implications of the photo.
“What does it mean for people 
to take a flag and put it up in a 
space that has been previously 
conquered 
by 
an 
invading 
country?” Reynolds said. “When 
people from the United States 
go to those countries and take 
a big flag with them and post it 
up, what does that mean to the 
people you’re working with?” 
Reynolds 
offered 
parting 
advice for those volunteering 
abroad on how to make the 

largest impact and how to utilize 
social media.
“Make a plan before you go 
abroad,” Reynolds said. “And 
when posting on social media, 
use captions to tell stories, add 
names and add what you learned 
from those people.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Margo 
Dickstein, 
who 
plans 
to 
volunteer in Israel this summer, 
told The Daily after the event 
that she hopes to gain a better 
understanding of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, echoing Reynold’s point 
of understanding the context 
and history of one’s study-abroad 
country. 
“I’m a double major in poli-
sci and international studies, so 
it’s good to gain international 
experience,” she said. “But I also 
think it’s important when you’re 
studying a conflict to not just look 
at it from the outside, but to see it 
from the inside. I’m excited to see 
it from a human perspective, not 
just a bunch of numbers.”

“Any 
new 
administration 
especially, when there is a 
change in party, there’s a sense 
of ‘We’re going to fix things, 
we’re going to reverse direction 
on some things that have been 
really bad,’” Donahue said. “But 
with the Trump administration, 
it was a really extraordinary 
sense of declaring Year Zero.”
Donahue 
outlined 
three 
phases in which the Trump 
administration 
worked 
to 
deregulate 
environmental 
policies. 
The 
first 
phase 
consisted of a series of executive 
orders Trump issued loosening 
regulations, including the “two-
for-one” executive order, which 
required federal agencies to 
eliminate two regulations for 
each new regulation they sought 
to implement.
“(Trump issued) the two-
for-one executive order to 
eliminate two regulations for 
every one new one,” Donahue 
said. “And also a requirement 
that 
new 
regulations 
that 
impose 
compliance 
costs 
on the private sector have 
to be offset by the repeal of 
regulations that will reduce 
compliance costs by at least 
an equal amount. And in 
that 
calculation, 
regulatory 
benefits like health benefits or 
other advantages that might be 
provided by regulation are not 
counted, which is a big deal.”
Donahue said while the Trump 
administration was enthusiastic 
about 
deregulation 
policies, 
they widely ignored the typical 
transition process in which civil 
servants within environmental 
agencies outline key functions 
of the organization and explain 
deregulation procedures.
“You have this very high 
level of ambition coupled with 

a disdain or failure to engage 
with the sort of machinery of 
changing the direction of the 
federal regulatory apparatus,” 
Donahue said.
Trump’s 
executive 
orders 
demanded 
the 
review 
and 
reconsideration of some of former 
President Barack Obama’s major 
regulations, such as the Clean 
Power Plan and clean water 
standards known as the “Waters 
of United States” rule.
Phase 
two 
of 
Trump’s 
deregulation, 
Donahue 
said, 
was 
suspending 
compliance 
dates of existing environmental 
regulations. 
This 
suspension 
prevents key industries from 
having to follow the regulations 
Trump 
plans 
to 
eventually 
repeal.
“The general idea is, ‘We want 
to change the regulation, maybe 
repeal them outright, maybe 
make them less onerous for 
industries or otherwise change 
them, and while we’re doing that 
we don’t want industry to have 
to worry about complying with 
them,’” Donahue said.
Donahue noted a suspension 
on regulating glider vehicles — 
heavy trucks sold as new despite 
having old engines that do not 
comply with the Clean Air Act. 
“The proposed rule got a lot 
of adverse comments, and so 
what they did was they decided 
they wanted more time to think 
about it and they issued a letter to 
the industry called a ‘No Action 
Assurance,’ 
which 
basically 
said, ‘We’re not going to enforce 
the emission limits on your 
vehicles,’” Donahue said.
LSA sophomore Dylan Berger, 
president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
and a columnist for The Daily, 
did not attend Donahue’s talk, 
but said in an email he agreed 
with the Trump administration’s 
efforts 
to 
repeal 
existing 

regulations. Still, Berger hopes to 
see a more comprehensive review 
of environmental initiatives by 
the administration in the future.
“As Americans, nothing is 
more important than protecting 
our 
beautiful 
environment,” 
Berger said in the email. “As 
such, we must tackle climate 
change and other threats to our 
environment head on. However, 
many of the regulations meant 
to protect the environment have 
fallen short of the mark. They do 
little to protect the environment 
while unnecessarily harming our 
economy. I applaud the efforts 
of the Trump administration 
to repeal these ineffective and 
harmful 
regulations. 
Going 
forward, however, I’d like to 
see the Trump administration 
outline a clear plan to protect 
both 
our 
environment 
and 
economy.”
On 
the 
campaign 
trail, 
Trump floated the possibility of 
abolishing the Environmental 
Protection 
Agency 
and 
has 
reiterated the idea since taking 
office. First year Law student 
Rebecca Maas attended the 
event and expressed her surprise 
over lack of support for the EPA.
“One 
thing 
that 
perhaps 
should not have surprised me 
is that the EPA is facing so 
many struggles with this new 
administration, when before it 
seemed that there was relatively 
high bipartisan support for an 
EPA, and now that bipartisan 
support seems to be in danger,” 
Maas said.
Donahue said the third phase 
of the Trump administration’s 
deregulation of environmental 
policy is the actual act of 
repealing regulations. Donahue 
mentioned the act to repeal 
the Clean Power Plan and its 
replacement 
with 
“deficient” 
alternatives. 
Under 
Trump, 
the EPA proposed replacing 

the Clean Power Plan with 
the Affordable Clean Energy 
proposal, which would allow 
states to have more autonomy 
in regulating greenhouse gas 
emissions 
from 
coal-burning 
power plants.
Donahue said this change was 
one of the most aggressive efforts 
to repeal regulations. 
“The 
transition 
between 
Obama and Trump is pretty 
much the level of the sort 
of violence of the change, is 
unprecedented,” Donahue said. 
“The harder Reagan transition 
generated a lot of the law we see 
cited … but I think it’s fair to say it 
wasn’t nearly as far reaching and 
Reagan’s regulatory people were 
a lot more conventional in their 
approach.”
Maas, 
a 
first 
generation 
college student whose family is 
from Germany, said the lack of 
political consensus surrounding 
environmental protection was 
unfamiliar to her.
“My 
family 
came 
from 
Germany, so I’m the first person 
from my family to graduate from 
an American college,” Maas 
said. “For us, the whole idea 
that people are arguing about 
keeping the environment clean 
is surprising because it is a very 
high priority in Germany. So I 
just hope in the future that both 
parties can agree on ways to keep 
our environment clean.”
Maas 
said 
she 
believed 
environmental protection should 
not be a partisan issue.
“I think the environment is 
important because regardless 
of which party you are from, 
you 
only 
get 
one 
world,” 
Maas said. “I hope that the 
current 
administration 
takes 
environmental 
issues 
more 
seriously 
moving 
forward, 
though based on what we heard 
about in this talk, I’m not sure if 
that will happen.”

I 

came to the University of 
Michigan understanding 
what 
it 
means 
“to 

grind.” 
Stuyvesant 

High 
School, 
my 

high school in New 
York 
City, 
was 
a 

notorious 
pressure 

cooker where, per 
The 
New 
York 

Times, “The social 
currency is academic 
achievement.” 
Students 
would 

brag about pulling 
all-nighters, 
there 

was 
constant 
analysis 
of 

everyone’s GPA and a joke 
among 
teachers 
was 
that 

the Stuyvesant cheer was, 
“What’d 
ya 
get?” 
after 

receiving exam results. In a 
poll by the school newspaper, 
over 80 percent of students 
reported 
having 
cheated 

at 
some 
point. 
However, 

students were explicit about 
their motivations for working.

Students 
worked 
hard 

so they could get the best 
grades, which would take 
them to the best colleges and 
subsequently to the best jobs. 
Though the culture induced by 
this mentality was toxic and 
dehumanizing, it was a logical 
mindset — especially for the 
43 
percent 
of 
Stuyvesant 

High 
School 
students 

classified as “economically 
disadvantaged.”

I was excited to leave the 

rat race. When I started at 
the University, I was amazed 
by how little my friends and I 
discussed grades — even when 
we were in the same class. I 
still do not know any of my 
friends’ GPAs. But that relief 
was short-lived. After almost 
two years here, I have noticed 
a closely related — but less 
logical — work ethic among 
many of my peers and myself 
similar to that which plagued 
my high school.

In 
this 
work 
ethic, 

instead of using academic 
achievement as social capital, 
we view effort as a value 
measure in and of itself. On 
the surface, it is good that 
we are placing value in the 
process, not the results; how 
we use our time says a lot 
about who we are. However, 
working just to show our 
peers and ourselves that we 
are working is emotionally 
self-serving — not logical.

It is worthwhile to think 

about why we are beholden to 
this illogical work ethic. I can 

think of a couple of reasons. 
The first is the increasing 
ubiquity of a college degree. 

According 
to 

government 
census 
data, 
for 

the first time, more 
than one-third of 
adult 
Americans 

have a bachelor’s 
degree. 
While 

going to college is 
more 
important 

than ever, going to 
simply go means 
less than it used 

to. Another factor is that 
college attendance is largely 
determined by family wealth. 
For wealthier students, there 
was never any doubt they 
would 
attend 
college, 
so 

they need ways to show they 
deserve this experience.

The second factor behind 

this work ethic is that, once in 
college, graduation is not seen 
as an achievement for most 
students. In the 2015-2016 
academic year, the University 
had a 91 percent six-year 
graduation 
rate. 
When 

almost everyone graduates, 
whether or not a student 
graduates does not say much 
about how hard they worked 
in college, because it is a 
uniform goal that most attain. 
Consequently, 
graduation 

does little to differentiate 
students within college.

Third, even within college, 

particularly in LSA, grades 
seem to mean less than we 
think they do. Elite law and 
medical schools require strong 
college grades but, for most 
such schools, standardized 
test 
scores 
are 
more 

important. 
For 
individuals 

hoping to find work right out 
of college, finding data on 
how employers value college 
grades 
was 
difficult, 
but 

my understanding from my 
and my peers’ experiences 
is that employers care more 
about experience and skills. 
Furthermore, 
a 
literature 

review found that college 
grades aren’t a good predictor 
of college success. None of 
this takes into account how 
grade inflation is hurting 
the legitimacy of grades as 
a good measurement. The 
consequence is that within 
elite colleges and universities, 
students need new ways of 
differentiating 
themselves 

and attaining social currency 
because traditional academic 
metrics are not as valuable as 
they used to be. Without these 
more objective measures of 
success, we have turned to hard 
work as an end, not a mean.

The 
last 
key 
reason 

we 
have 
this 
mindset 
is 

guilt. We feel the guilt and 
privilege of going to an elite 
college 
because 
we 
know 

that such a small proportion 
of Americans get to have 
this remarkable experience. 
The college experience is 
expensive and open-ended, 
leading us to feel as though 
we need to maximize every 
second of our time here by 
filling it up with activities, 
meetings or classes.

We can see this mindset 

all 
around 
us. 
We 
burn 

ourselves out by overloading 
our schedules, we add double 
majors and minors so we can 
mention them in an icebreaker, 
and we brag to our friends 
about how late we were up 
at the UGLi. Working hard is 
important and essential, but 
working hard for the sake of 
working hard is toxic.

Our 
competitive, 
hard-

working culture is difficult 
to fix because the factors that 
contribute to it are so positive. 
We don’t want to go back to a 
time when college was a club 
of wealthy white boys where 
admittance alone determines 
outcomes, because we know 
how much influence wealth 
has over college acceptances. 
We also don’t want to make 
it more difficult to graduate, 
because the students that 
graduate deserve to do so. And 
if grades had more meaning, it 
would be as if we were back 
in high school. But we need 
to examine the motivation 
behind our hard work, and 
ensure that it does not become 
our social currency, because 
hard work and busyness are 
not everything.

Vote for Boring in 2020

W

ith 
Democratic 

primary 
hopefuls 

not 
so 
quietly 

taking trips to Iowa and 
New Hampshire, the field 
is wide open to challenge 
President Donald Trump in 
his re-election bid to “Keep 
America Great.” Let us turn 
to our nation’s past elections 
and leaders for insight into 
our 
upcoming 
historical 

presidential election.

The 
recent 
passing 
of 

former President George H.W. 
Bush has provided us the 
opportunity to reflect on his 
legacy as the most effective 
one-term president in modern 
history. His administration’s 
efficacy 
can 
be 
largely 

attributed to his years of hard 
work and experience. Having 
taken office as, arguably, the 
most qualified person to ever 
become commander-in-chief, 
Bush came to the Oval Office 
with more than 20 years of 
experience 
as 
the 
former 

vice president, director of 
the CIA, Republican National 
Committee chairman, United 
Nations 
ambassador, 
U.S. 

representative 
from 
Texas 

and World War II hero. By all 
accounts, Bush was certainly 
a “D.C. insider” and this 
was a good thing. In 2020, 
we need an insider with the 
institutional 
knowledge 

necessary to effectively lead 
the 
government. 
Someone 

who has quietly been doing the 
work of our nation for decades. 
Not 
another 
billionaire 

outsider or ambitious career 
politician eager to make a 
name for themselves.

We 
must 
ask: 
What 

regulatory, 
executive 
and 

discretionary 
actions 
does 

the next president plan to 
issue in order to begin to 
heal our nation, reeling from 
arguably the most turbulent 
administration 
since 
1974? 

Right now, our country needs 
a 
competent, 
humble 
and 

level-headed leader to govern. 
We ought to look to our 
history and take stock of how 
we as a nation navigated rocky 
waters in the past. Michigan 
native 
President 
Gerald 

Ford rose to the occasion, 
becoming president with no 
ambition for power but out of 
service to the nation. Ford’s 
personal humility and years 
of 
experience 
representing 

Michigan in the House of 
Representatives are exactly 
what the country needed on 
the heels of President Richard 
Nixon’s resignation disaster. 
By all accounts, Ford could be 
considered a boring politician. 
As 
the 
first 
non-elected 

president, Ford took office 
at a time when confidence in 
the government was at an all-
time low, but still managed to 
steady the ship and keep the 
trains running.

The Democrats ought to 

choose a candidate who is 
experienced, who has a vision 
and who some may even 
consider a little “boring,” as 
were Truman, Ford and Bush, 
all of whom were seasoned D.C. 
operators and well qualified 
for the job of president.

Sen. 
Kamala 
Harris, 

D-Calif., has taken center stage 
in the gaggle of progressives 
gnawing at the bit for the 
opportunity 
to 
challenge 

Trump, who currently has 
the lowest overall approval 
rating 
compared 
to 
other 

presidents since he’s taken 
office. 
However, 
Harris’ 

recent admission that she 
hopes to rid the American 
health care system of private 
insurance 
companies 
is 

demonstrative of the out-of-
touch sensationalist policies 
of the progressive arm of the 
Democratic party, though she 
retracted the statement.

Democrats rebranded in 

2018 in a desperate attempt 

to differentiate themselves 
from 
former 
Secretary 
of 

State 
Hillary 
Clinton 
and 

the corporate arm of the 
Democratic Party. Candidates 
such as Harris, Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-N.J. and Sen. Cory 
Booker, D-Mass., have used 
Senate hearings as a launching 
pad 
for 
their 
campaigns 

instead 
of 
working 
with 

their Republican colleagues 
on doing the business of the 
American people.

2020 candidate Sen. Bernie 

Sanders, 
I-Vt., 
has 
spent 

the past two years taking 
aim at Trump and his more 
eccentric statements instead 
of proposing legislation or 
using his Senate seat for more 
than a springboard to run 
for president again. Sanders 
has shelved his enthusiasm 
and bully pulpit for the past 
two years with the intention 
of 
preserving 
himself 
for 

another grueling presidential 
campaign.

What are the Democratic 

Party’s policy initiatives for 
2020? What actions will they 
take to unravel the Trump 
administration’s conservative 
directives 
and 
policies? 

Which Democratic candidate 
will 
bring 
the 
humility 

of 
Ford, 
the 
technocratic 

expertise of Bush and the 
steady handedness of former 
President Barack Obama?

As 
students, 
we 
ought 

to look to the soft-spoken, 
“boring” candidate who can 
humble themselves within the 
most powerful office in the 
world to enact change. Not 
“change that we can believe 
in,” but rather “change we 
can 
achieve.” 
With 
news 

outlets already covering the 
still far-off 2020 presidential 
election, let us be intentional 
in our vote. We must look for 
leaders who have meaningful 
track records and impressive 
resumes. And be open to 
candidates 
who, 
yes, 
may 

appear a little bit boring.

Why we glorify “the grind”

H

ouse 
Bill 
4205, 

signed 
during 
the 

lame duck session 

by former Gov. Rick Snyder 
on Dec. 28, 2018, prohibits 
state agencies from enacting 
or adopting policy that is 
stricter 
than 
the 
federal 

standards. This will impact 
environmental 
regulations 

across the state of Michigan 
insofar that it will put an end 
to intelligent policy that fits 
Michigan’s unique situation 
as a state benefitting hugely 
from industries relying on a 
clean, well-kept environment.

The 
economic 
benefits 

from stricter than federal 
environmental 
regulations 

that 
ensure 
our 
state 

remains in pristine condition 
are 
plentiful: 
Tourism 
in 

Michigan 
generated 
$22 

billion in 2014 in revenue 
for 
the 
state 
and 
local 

businesses, forestry products 
and 
recreation 
in 
forests 

generated $12 billion in 2012 
and 
hunting 
and 
fishing 

generated 
more 
than 
$2 

billion in 2018. All these 
sectors 
of 
the 
Michigan 

economy require policy that 
is mindful of the common 
denominator 
all 
of 
these 

money-makers 
share: 
a 

pristine environment. This 
is 
not 
including 
indirect 

beneficiaries of beauty like golf 
courses, of which Michigan 
has more than most states.

HB 4205 takes control of 

reasonable 
environmental 

management 
and 
policy 

and 
takes 
regulation 
out 

of the hands of Michigan 
agencies at a time when 
outdoor 
recreation 
is 
the 

fastest 
growing 
sector 
of 

Midwestern 
economies. 

Andy Northrop, a Michigan 
State University Extension 

faculty member who works 
in tourism, leadership and 
civic 
engagement, 
while 

writing a commentary over 
this report, notes that “. . 
.tourism activity in Michigan 
generates 
approximately 

$2.4 billion in state and 
local taxes. In the absence of 
these taxes, each household 
in Michigan would have to 
pay $640 to fill the gap.” 
This sum will only increase 
if Michigan agencies can’t 
enact the policies necessary 
to 
safeguard 
against 

environmental 
degradation, 

the likes of which will have 
a negative impact on tourism 

and thus tourism revenue, 
and, ultimately, increase that 
$640.

Now you might be thinking, 

“It’s not like I have to pay 
that” or “I don’t see tourism 
filling my pockets with cash,” 
but I implore you to consider 
that while you might not 
benefit directly in the form 
of some sort of payout, your 
city, county and ultimately 
state do benefit, and when 
they benefit from increased 
revenue, they are less inclined 
to raise taxes, which does 
directly benefit you. But this 
is all related to Michigan’s 
ability to control and manage 
its own land, our own land, 
and it is for these reasons we 
need to repeal and replace 
HB 4205 with something 
that reflects our heritage and 
economic characteristics as a 
state. The federal government 
is 
not 
Michigan; 
we, 
as 

citizens 
of 
this 
beautiful 

state, 
know 
better 
than 

those in Washington what 
environmental 
policies 
we 

need to safeguard and promote 
both our environment and 
our economy. Thus, let our 
direction 
not 
be 
stricter 

rather 
than 
federal, 
but 

simply better.

In 1978, the acclaimed novelist 
Yuko Tsushima published “Territory 
Of Light” a chapter at a time in the 
Japanese monthly literary magazine 
Gunzo, each chapter representing 
one month in a year. Tsushima 
is well-known in Japan, but is 
relatively unknown to Anglophone 
readers. The small amount of her 
work that has been translated 
into 
English 
is 
her 
most 
autobiographical 
component, 
and 
it’s 
autobiographical in way 
that might be unfamiliar 
to Anglophone audiences. 
Long before the word 
“autofiction” was coined 
in French or English, 
Japanese 
authors 
had 
been 
writing 
gently 
fictionalized 
accounts 
of their lives in what is 
known as shishosetsu, or 
“I-fiction.” These works 
are written as reflections 
or examinations of the 
author’s life, and the 
strikingly clear realism 
of the genre has no 
real analog in Western 
literature. 
Tsushima’s 
work frequently deals 
with the experiences of single 
mothers in 20th-century Japan’s 
intensely patriarchal and work-
obsessed society, and “Territory 
Of Light” follows this model — the 
story is told from the perspective of 
an unnamed woman, who recently 
divorced her husband and is tasked 
with raising their young daughter 
alone.
The novel closely follows the 
minutiae of day-to-day life in Tokyo 
— the protagonist takes her daughter 
to daycare, holds down a desk job 
and embarks on endless strings of 
errands and chores, often dragging 
her unwilling daughter along. The 
incessant pace of life gives the 
story a sense of constant motion, 
even as the protagonist’s loneliness 
presses in from all sides. Very few 
other characters receive as much 
development — they just flit in and 

out of the protagonist’s attention 
and are occasionally the subject of 
tentative, quietly desperate acts. 
She has an ill-advised one-night 
stand with an acquaintance, she 
gets excessively drunk at a bar with 
strangers, she invites one of her 
ex-husband’s pathetic students over 
for lack of any other real friends. 
Many of the side characters are 
beautifully 
sketched 
in 
outline, 
and the reader is painfully aware 
of the social barriers between the 
protagonist and the rest of the 

world. She is reminded again and 
again that divorced mothers are at a 
decisive disadvantage — one of her 
acquaintances from the daycare go 
as far as to tell her she would be “at 
the bottom of the heap.” Even as we 
see the protagonist begin to spiral 
without support — drinking heavily 
to stay asleep at night, having 
strange visions of death, showing 
up late for work, briefly wishing 
her daughter was dead — nothing 
drastic or cruel happens. There are 
moments where it seems as though 
something absolutely terrible is 
going to happen (it never does) or 
some great juncture in the story is 
going to happen (it never does), but 
life stabilizes itself somehow and 
the protagonist must continue as 
best she can. 
Her loneliness also seems related 
to how intently she focuses on her 

surroundings, and the sensitive and 
somewhat sad way she apprehends 
them. The novel provides a crystal-
clear 
yet 
utterly 
idiosyncratic 
vision of Tokyo, following the 
protagonist’s 
vision 
down 
long 
associative trails and occasionally 
into near-delirium. She describes a 
stand of trees as “some plant species, 
expelled from the sky, which in a 
fit of disgruntlement had stiffened 
into these three brooding pillars 
as it landed.” More often, though, 
experience is just given a luminous 
rinse and left to stand 
on its own, unmarred 
by any self-consciously 
“novelistic” processing. 
When 
her 
daughter 
drops 
origami 
paper 
from their fourth-story 
roof, 
the 
protagonist 
briefly pictures it: “I 
could only conclude that 
every sheet in the pack 
… had floated down, one 
after the other, taking 
its time and enjoying the 
breeze, onto the tiled 
roof 
below.” 
Shortly 
after this scene, she has 
to apologize profusely 
to 
her 
neighbors 
for 
the trash on their roof. 
One gets the sense that 
Tsushima endows her 
character with such a 
powerful sense of perception as a 
way to cope with an existence so 
crushing it threatens to overwhelm 
her. This is an incredibly effective 
combination, 
and 
despite 
the 
understated tone, the novel has an 
unexpected emotional weight.
Since the novel was originally 
published in serial, each chapter 
is relatively self-contained, and its 
compilation into a novel can feel 
awkward at times. Each chapter 
contains a relatively limited and 
yet wholly self-contained arc, and 
the novel has no overall trajectory 
beyond the allotted space of a year. 
With a novelist any less perceptive 
and skilled at making the everyday 
glitter, 
this 
structure 
wouldn’t 
work at all — Tsushima’s airy prose, 
however, makes the recounting of 
small moments prismatic rather 
than static.

‘Territory of Light’ a stunning 
look at empathy and loneliness

To call “High Flying Bird” 
a sports movie would be like 
calling “The Social Network” 
a court drama. Sure, it would 
be true, but would also be a 
fatally narrow interpretation of 
the work. Steven Soderbergh’s 
(“Unsane”) latest project is so 
much more than it appears: It’s a 
microcosm of race and American 
power structures, an electrified 
dive into the nuance of NBA 
labor conflicts and a meditation 
on the evolving information 
age. It’s a seemingly mundane 
concept for a movie transformed 
into a prescient web of ideas by 
“Moonlight” screenwriter Tarell 
Alvin McCraney, and ultimately, 
one of the most intriguing films I 
have seen recently.
The film covers the sneaky, 
perceptive 
maneuvers 
of 
NBA agent Ray Burke (Andre 
Holland, “Moonlight”) as he 
navigates between players and 
team owners during a league 
lockout. While the movie is 
centered around basketball, it 
is far more concerned with the 
gritty and complex backroom 
business of the sport than 
courts and scoreboards. While 
player 
representative 
Myra 
(Sonja Johnson, “The Chi”) and 
team owner David Seton (Kyle 
MacLachlan, 
“Inside 
Out”) 
struggle to compromise and 
end the lockout, Burke hatches 
a plan of his own, equipped 
with charming persuasion and 
discerning foresight.
Holland’s 
performance 
as Burke is one of the film’s 
highlights. His lines are hefty 
soliloquies spoken at nearly 
twice the speed of normal 
conversation, but he carries 

them off with ease and elegance. 
The most challenging aspect of 
the performance is that Holland 
must appear believably one step 
ahead of everyone in the room 
without them knowing it in order 
for the character to work. And 
indeed, Burke’s energetic grace 
embodies this quality perfectly 
to pack a startling punch near 
the film’s end.

Since the film is mostly just 
people talking to each other, 
Soderbergh must get creative 
in how he keeps the scenes 
visually engaging. As both the 
cinematographer and editor he 
employs nearly every tool at his 
disposal. The most palpable of 
these is his decision to shoot 
the entire movie on an iPhone 
8. From the very first frame of 
the movie, it becomes evident 
that this choice plays a key part 
in how Soderbergh stages every 
scene. The iPhone as the camera 
ultimately feels essential to the 
visual language of “Bird” simply 
because of how inimitable the 
film looks.
The many wide shots of 
New York stand out because 
the iPhone lens gives them a 
memorably 
warped 
quality. 
Soderbergh 
also 
places 
the 

camera in normally impossible 
places, 
at 
various 
points 
strapping the iPhone on a ceiling, 
to the back of a car seat and in a 
narrow train aisle. While most 
of these shots were fascinating 
enough to spice up a dialogue 
heavy narrative, there were 
also times when the iPhone’s 
limitations became clear. Every 
time the camera moved from 
natural to studio light, there was 
a visibly distracting filtering of 
light onscreen.
A notable flaw of the film is 
that it might be too smart. I found 
myself having to turn on closed 
captions or rewind frequently to 
comprehend a rapid exchange. 
It’s an intellectually demanding 
process that not everyone will 
relish in. That being said, the 
film did make me engaged in the 
politics of NBA lockouts, a hefty 
feat for someone who hasn’t 
followed the organization for 
years. The movie offers whatever 
you’re willing to put in.
The 
real 
impact 
behind 
McCraney’s script is not simply 
how esoteric it is. He uses the 
backdrop of NBA lockouts to 
comment on far more than 
the nuances of contracts and 
board room meetings. One of 
the film’s lingering questions 
is just what the best platform is 
for professional basketball in an 
era of rising streaming services. 
In this way, “Bird” offers a 
commentary not only on the 
NBA, but on filmmaking itself. 
Where is the best place for the 
content we consume today, on a 
platform as accessible as Netflix 
or a space as traditional as cable 
TV? McCraney’s ability to weave 
these questions into the conflict 
of “Bird” is truly enthralling, 
cementing “Bird” as a powerful 
sports drama with the smarts to 
delve beyond its own premise.

Bird’

Netflix

The RAW Natural Born Artists show 
took place in downtown Detroit at St. 
Andrew’s Hall on Feb.13th. The show, 
which had the goal of empowering local 
artists and providing them with a platform, 
certainly did not fail to impress. All forms 
of art — fashion, textiles, cosmetics, live 
music and photography — came together 
in the eclectic space that is St. Andrew’s 
Hall to represent the diversity of creativity 
that 
lies 
within 
the 
growing 
community 
of 
artists in Detroit. An event 
completely 
by 
and 
for 
artists, RAW holds shows 
all around the country, 
inviting artists to showcase 
and sell their work at 
mandated venues.
Contributing to the sense 
of independence that is 
re-emerging in downtown 
Detroit, the RAW Showcase 
was just a taste of the talent 
and development that is 
occuring in our very own 
backyard. Serving as a 
reminder as to why we 
cannot forget about our dear 
Detroit, the show blended 
all aspects of any and every 
part of design, completely 
catering to independent 
artists personal work and 
business, carving a space 
for a conversation about the 
world of artistic mediums 
and experimentation.
Said first year attendee 
and artist Katherine Cross, 
“It (this show) has exceeded 
my expectations, I’m super 
impressed by the group of people they 
brought together- music, hair, all types of 
artistry, and I think that is so cool.”
The vibrant show truly represented all 
aspects of the art spectrum, all tied together 
through mini concerts played by various 
artists throughout the entire event. The 
show catered to a lifelong dedication and 
love for art and design, as shown by many 
of the artists present, Cross included. A self-
branded surface designer, Cross spoke on 
her own practice as an artist and how she 
arrived at the show.
“It was total serendipity. One day I 
started cutting things out of magazines. 
Then, I started organizing them by color 
and making them into collages. I was 
originally trained as a portrait artist, I have 
a degree in human figure drawing. But 
here I’ve found myself cutting out abstract 

shapes and things out of magazine pages,” 
Cross said.
Cross’s process speaks to the entire 
show and its total encouragement for 
experimentation across all mediums of art 
and design, one growing in the world of 
design as well. In a physical world covered 
in surfaces, from paper to textiles, to 
everything in between, Cross left no stone 
unturned when beginning her business 
founded on color, collage and texture. Said 
Cross, “It started with cards, I was living 
abroad when I started this company, and 
I went around to all the little shops in my 
town asking ‘would you be 
interested in using these for 
your floral arrangements?’ 
And they said yes! My first 
order was a florist shop, so 
I designed small gift cards 
and different things for 
that.”
The versatility of Cross’s 
work aligns itself with a 
conversation occuring all 
across the world of art and 
design about the use of 
textiles, color and pattern in 
fashion and beyond. Cross 
does not limit herself to 
checking one box in design, 
as a surface designer she 
completely plays off the ever 
changing characteristics of 
design, curating her work 
to fit just about any surface. 
A pioneer in self-branding 
and material use, Cross is 
changing the definition of 
what it means to be both 
an artist and designer, 
a 
concept 
the 
RAW 
show catered to. Cross’s 
inspiration 
started 
in 
fashion and has completely 
extended to other mediums 
including paper products and jewelry.
“My favorite designer is Dries Van Noten 
— the way he mixes pattern and color 
and things like that — so I love vintage 
materials, I love textiles that have texture, 
unique patterns, everything — I’ve always 
been a lover of fabric. I love it, I gotta buy 
it. I do love fashion, when I was a kid I had 
a cousin who got Vogue and I would always 
just look through the pages and think it was 
just the most amazing beautiful artwork,” 
Cross said.
Cross and all the artists at the RAW 
Show are completely revolutionizing what 
it means to be immersed in an art form, 
taking initiative and inserting themselves 
into a conversation and effort to blend 
and support all styles of art and design, a 
beautiful balance one really could only find 
in downtown Detroit.

RAW is spectacular

‘Territory of Light’ 

Yuko Tsushima

Farrar, Straus and Giroux

Feb. 12, 2019

Though 
varying 
in 
subject 
matter, through their common 
themes of youth, childhood and 
power in a fresh light, the 2019 Oscar 
Short Films perfectly complement 
one another. That said, the sheer 
degree of heaviness and intensity 
that characterizes each film makes 
digesting them all in one sitting a 
challenge, to say the least.
When 
Marta 
(Marta 
Nieto 
“Karabudjan”) 
receives 
an 
unexpected phone call from her 
six-year-old son Iván (Álvaro Balas 
“Bajo la red”), who is on a camping 
trip with his father, she is alarmed 
to find that Iván is stranded on a 
beach alone. In the panic of “Madre” 
that follows, though Marta fights to 
keep her calm and protect her son as 
best she can from thousands of miles 
away, her composure crumbles as her 
worst nightmares come to fruition. 
The beauty of “Madre” is not in what 
it shows, but what it doesn’t. There is 
no advantage given to the audience 
in this film. Though presented with 
panning-shots of an isolated beach, 
presumably the one that Iván refers 
to over the phone, we never see Iván 
and, by consequence, we feel just as 
distraught and bewildered as Marta. 
Mirroring Marta onscreen, over the 
19 minutes of “Madre” our heart 
rates increase minute by minute, 
our anxieties bubble over and, by the 
credits, we feel just as powerless and 
hopeless as Marta. 
Reacquainting viewers with the 
topic of children, “Fauve” presents a 
harrowing depiction of the perils of 
childhood ignorance. Epitomizing 
the image of ‘kids being kids,’ tween 
boys Tyler (Félix Greiner) and 
Benjamin (Alexandre Perreault) are 
messing around outside, playfully 
testing each other’s egos through 
tests of strength and dares. What 
begins as harmless fun soon turns 
hazardous, however, when one 

of their pranks leads to Benjamin 
getting stuck in and sinking into 
the concrete of a surface mine. 
Most intriguing about “Fauve” 
is its exploration of innocence 
lost. In one moment, Tyler and 
Benjamin are boys: innocent, naïve 
and reckless. In the next, Tyler is 
hardened, encompassed by a dark 
cloud severity. “Fauve” indirectly 
poses a question of where the line 
between childhood freedom and a 
need for supervision and protection 
should be drawn. Especially in our 
tech-saturated society, a question 
arises: With digital knowledge that 
far surpasses that of their parents 
and unrestricted access to social 
media, has childhood innocence has 
become an ideal of the past?
A picnic after the upsetting 
plotlines of both “Madre” and 
“Fauve,” 
“Marguerite” 
is 
a 
refreshing 
and 
much-welcomed 
change of pace. Centered around 
the relationship between an elderly 
woman 
Marguerite 
(Béatrice 
Picard “Ma tante Aline”) and her 
younger caregiver Rachel (Sandrine 
Bisson “1981”), the film explores 
the concept of youth, regret and 
repressed sexuality. Unlike the two 
pictures before it, “Marguerite” is 
much quainter, depicting the day 
to day routine of the older woman 
Marguerite and the progressive 
growth of her peculiar friendship 
with Rachel. Through a focus on 
the little things, bath times, pills, 
cups of tea drank in solitude and 
brief, yet heartfelt chats between 
Rachel and Marguerite, the film 
paints a broader picture about the 
loneliness that can accompany old 
age and the ever-present desire for 
companionship within us all.
Believing that the worst of 
the somber and depressing was 
over after “Madre” and “Fauve,” 
“Detainment” functions as the 
rudest 
of 
awakenings. 
Based 
on the horrifying story of the 
abduction and murder of toddler 
James Bulger (Caleb Mason) by 

10-year-old boys Jon and Robert, 
this film offers no silver lining or 
moment of relief for audiences to 
grasp. Through a compilation of 
documentary-esque flashbacks and 
separate interrogation sequences 
of the two boys, the film rehashes 
the day rehashing the day of 
James’s murder. Traumatizing and 
mentally paining enough as a film 
adaptation, the knowledge that 
this film is based on a true story is 
almost too inconceivable to process. 
While successfully debunking the 
stereotype of children as innocents 
on its head, it leaves us all feeling 
sickened in the process. Though well-
made and disturbingly captivating, 
the premise of “Detainment” is 
ultimately too awful to stomach 
and allow for a meaningful viewing 
experience. When the credits do 
finally role, it is mercifully so.
Thankfully, the best of the shorts 
is saved for last. “Skin” illuminates 
the vileness of modern racism 
through a sobering portrayal of the 
influence of a parent’s actions on 
a child’s. In a rural small town, a 
fervid white supremacist brutally 
beats a Black stranger for smiling at 
his son Troy (Jackson Robert Scott 
“It”) in a convenience store parking 
lot, igniting a violent clash between 
the local Black and white gangs. 
Though the plot revolves around 
the brief gang war that ensues over 
the single incident, the essence of 
“Skin” is an unmissable message 
about the learnedness of racism. 
Much of the hate between the two 
gangs is observed and acted upon by 
the sons of the respective members, 
emphasizing the impressionable 
nature of children. While the very 
level of hostility that the film exposes 
makes it nothing short of enraging 
to watch at times, “Skin” delivers a 
much-needed message that deflates 
the illusion of a post-racial society by 
bringing to screen the realities and 
repercussions of racial hatred to an 
audience that otherwise wouldn’t 
see them.

Almost a year and a half 
ago, one of my close friends 
joined a new club on campus. 
However, this club wasn’t 
like the other ones I heard 
of — it didn’t revolve around 
a specific team activity or 
a shared academic interest. 
No, this club was a cutthroat 
competition 
that 
kicked 
people out once a week and 
would end with only one 
remaining. 
This 
was 
the 
first 
season 
of 
“Survivor: 
Michigan.”
Growing up, “Survivor” was 
not a television show of choice 
in my household. In fact, to 
this date I have never seen 
an episode of the CBS show. 
The closest thing I’ve got is 
my occasional binge-watch of 
“Total Drama Island.” Tribal 
council, immunity idols, Jeff 
Probst? Never heard of them. 
When my friend first told me 
they would be competing on 
the show, I originally thought 
it was a gag of some kind. 
How could you compete on a 
survival show while going to 
school? Were they going to 
live in the Arb for eight weeks? 
It turns out there’s more 
to “Survivor” then literally 
surviving. As I’ve now been 
told many times, “Survivor” 
is a strategic, social game far 
more dependent on your brain 
that it is your ability to start a 
fire or catch fish with a trap.
At first I didn’t understand 
what they meant by “being on 
the show” either. Who is going 
to watch a bunch of college 
students pretending to be on 
“Survivor?” Who is going to 
edit it? How will people even 
know this exists? Much to my 
shock, as the year progressed 
all 
of 
my 
friends 
slowly 
became aware that there was 
an entire network of college 
“Survivor” shows out there, 
and that despite the often 

low-quality camerawork and 
lighting, 
people 
actually 
watched 
them. 
 
Today, 
“Survivor: Michigan” has its 
own subreddit, fan podcast, 

and is bringing in thousands 
of views on YouTube every 
week. It sort of blows my 
mind 
how 
many 
die-hard 
“Survivor” fans are out there.
Watching 
my 
friend 
compete in this was a truly 
bizarre experience. At first 
we all thought they were 
mostly doing it just as a fun 
way to spend a semester, but 
pretty quickly we started to 
understand that to the people 
competing, it was no simple 
game. From the time my friend 
started competing to the time 
the game was over, all we 
heard about was “Survivor.” 
Hours were spent scouring 
campus 
for 
“idol 
clues,” 
names of other competitors 
were thrown around in the 
same tone of disdain usually 
reserved for Sparty or Duo 
Identification and the tension 
was constantly high.
Now 
that 
the 
show 
is 
actually being released week 
to week on YouTube, the 
entire experience is slightly 
surreal. As my friend relives 
a semester of their life, so 

do the rest of us by vaguely 
recalling the conversations 
and drama that surrounded 
it at the time. It’s a bizarre 
window into the past, but one 
that is treated by the general 
audience as the present. The 
Michigan Union is open on 
this show. Construction has 
not yet come to consume The 
Diag. Michigan Time still 
exists and people run around 
in t-shirts and shorts in a 
beautiful fall. In the midst 
of this cold and long winter, 
there’s strange warmth that 
comes from getting a one-
hour dose of fall in Ann Arbor 
every week. 
The really crazy thing is 
that despite being produced 
and edited almost entirely 
by one person (George Jayne, 
Class of 2018), the actual show 
is pretty good. Now, I do have 
a huge bias here, because the 
entertainment value derived 
from watching my friend get 
criticized in YouTube and 
Reddit comments is insanely 
high, and I can’t speak to how 
well this compares to actual 
“Survivor” 
or 
even 
other 
college “Survivors,” but what 
I can say is that the inside-
baseball Michigan angle of 
it makes for a very appealing 
watch for current students. As 
you watch you’re constantly 
wondering, what would I do 
in this situation? How would 
I possibly balance this with 
school? And do these people 
even go to class, or do they 
just play “Survivor” all the 
time? I don’t have the answers 
to those questions and I don’t 
have an answer to how the 
rest of the season is going to 
play out, but what I can say is 
this: there are worse ways to 
spend a Friday night.
“Survivor: 
Michigan” 
is now airing on YouTube 
Fridays at 8 p.m.

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN

On my roommate, and how 
he made it to our television

Avril Lavigne, more than 
any other pop star (except Lady 
Gaga), has had an absurd amount 
of personas throughout her 
career. The Canadian phenom 
was launched into fame nearly 
17 (holy shit, we’re getting old) 
years ago with 2002’s Let Go. 
And for good reason — it’s an 
absolutely iconic alt-rock album. 
Good luck finding anyone who 
doesn’t know every single word 
of “Sk8er Boi.” She maintained 
the status quo with 2004’s Under 
My Skin before doing a complete 
180 in 2007 with The Best Damn 
Thing — possibly post-death and 
post-replacement by double. This 
album is notable for featuring one 
of the greatest songs of all time, 
“Girlfriend.” Lavigne shed her 
angsty vulnerability for a hard-
ass attitude, and it is safe to say 
that her risk to fuse glam-rock 
and pop paid off. Unfortunately, 
save for a few singles, her 2011 
and 2013 efforts were hardly 
memorable, and the end seemed 
nigh for Miss Lavigne.
This actually happens to be 
quite literal, as her latest album 
Head Above Water is about her 
near-death experience battling 
Lyme disease. Her struggle over 
the past six years has pushed her 

back to her roots, leaving behind 
alt-pop hooks for ballad-y piano 
melodies. The album is an odd 
combination of bad-girl Avril 
and old-school Avril, pasted 
together in a messy fashion. Her 
vocal melodies carry a nostalgic 

punch, reminiscent of the girl 
who denied the skater boy. 
But here’s the kicker: This is a 
Christian album.
On the album opener, biblical 
imagery is abundant. “Can’t part 
the sea, can’t reach the shore,” 
she calls out; “God, keep my 
head above water / Don’t let me 
drown, it gets harder / I’ll meet 
you there at the altar,” the chorus 
begs. In truth, it’s pretty catchy, 
but at the same time, a very 
unexpected turn of events for 
the girl once yelling “Hell yeah, 
I’m the motherfuckin’ princess!” 
It’s almost safe to say it’s the 

album’s peak because every song 
following it elicits a “what the 
actual hell” within 10 seconds.
Head Above Water is like a 
box of chocolates but every piece 
contains a different type of nut. 
Ultimately, you’re gonna be 
disappointed after a bite or 
two. There are blues tracks, 
there are pop songs, there 
are ballads and there is even 
a track with a Nicki Minaj 
verse. There’s just way too 
much going on here, and 
none of it particularly stands 
out.
In her defense, there was 
no way she was getting away 
with yet another reinvention 
in 2019. Pop is too in right 
now — it’s that genre, and 
it’s fucking cutthroat. Pop 
stars come and go on a whim, 
and only the truly strong keep 
their head above water in today’s 
environment. Lavigne’s roots 
are too deep, her legacy too set 
in stone. If you’re not innovating 
today, pop will chew you up 
and spit you out on your head. 
Her insistence to maintain a 
semblance of the pop she was 
putting out over a decade ago 
is near fatal. What I’m getting 
at here is that Lavigne, while 
holding on to nostalgia at times, 
is outdated. Do yourself a favor 
and listen to “Mine” by Slayyyter 
instead.

ALBUM REVIEW

Head Above 
Water

Avril Lavigne

BMG Rights Management

The 
first 
time 
I 
ever 
heard 
Benjamin 
Britten’s 
“War 
Requiem,” 
I 
was 
immediately struck by the 
colossal nature of the work: 
A full orchestra, a chamber 
orchestra, 
an 
organ, 
a 
boys’ choir, an adult choir 
and three solo vocalists. 
And the subject matter — 
the juxtaposition of war 
poetry and the traditional 
Latin 
requiem 
texts 
— 
seems equally colossal and 
foreboding.
Listening to recordings or 
watching videos of the work, 
it is hard to fully understand 
the piece. It is lengthy, 
dissonant and emotionally 
draining. Though I have 
tried many times to make it 
through the complete work, 
I will admit that I have never 
done so without the aid of a 
score to keep my attention.
Last 
Saturday’s 
performance of the work 
at Hill Auditorium was a 
reminder 
of 
what 
makes 
the piece so special when 
heard live. The Ann Arbor 
Symphony 
Orchestra, 
the 
UMS 
Choral 
Union, 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Youth 
Chorale, 
soprano 
Tatiana 
Pavlovskaya, tenor Anthony 
Dean Griffey and baritone 
Stephen 
Powell 
combined 
for an absolutely stunning 
performance. I left in a state 
of contemplative awe, unable 
to 
think 
about 
anything 
except the work.
For those unfamiliar with 
the piece, it opens with 
the 
traditional 
Requiem 
aeternam text before moving 
on 
to 
Wilfred 
Owen’s 
“Anthem for Doomed Youth.” 
Owen’s poetry, written while 
he was a British soldier in 
the trenches of World War I, 
is dark and straightforward. 
It ruminates on the failures 
of humanity leading up to 
World War I; the failures 
of European belief systems 
to prevent the tremendous 
loss of life that was the two 
World Wars.
The orchestral and choral 
writing is at times stormy 
and at other times slow 
and mournful. The opening 
movement, 
for 
example, 
is jolting and frightening. 
The audience member is 
transformed into a civilian 
during the darkest moments 

of these total wars, living in 
fear of what comes next and 
in sadness at what has come 
before.
And 
yet, 
Britten 
soon 
contrasts these sentiments 
with 
the 
angelic 
beauty 
of the boys’ choir. In this 
performance, 
they 
were 
placed in the top balcony, 
their singing of religious 
texts literally floating down 
from above. The baritone 
and tenor, meanwhile, take 
on the role of narrators, 
reading 
Owen’s 
texts 
in 
opera-esque recitative style.
Through 
these 
juxtapositions, 
Britten 
pulls different, frightening 
meanings out of the requiem 
texts. In some instances, 
he plays for dark irony, 
highlighting 
instances 
of 
peace in these texts, pledges 
for a world that must have 
seemed 
all 
but 
foreign 
to those alive during the 
World Wars. At other points, 
he draws out much more 
sinister undertones, drawing 
the 
audience 
member’s 
attention to violence and 
conflict in religious texts. 
Violence, he seems to say, is 
an awful aspect of the human 
condition — something that 
we should work to eradicate, 
and yet something that is 
unfortunately intrinsic to 
humanity.
This 
is 
perhaps 
most 
poignant 
in 
the 
third 
movement, 
the 
“Offertorium.” Towards the 
end of this movement, the 
baritone and tenor perform 
Owen’s “The Parable of the 
Old Man and the Young,” a 
retelling of the story of Isaac 
and Abraham. The poem 
ends with two startling lines, 
connecting 
this 
Biblical 
story with the World Wars. 
“But the old man would not 
so, but slew his son, / And 
half the seed of Europe, one 
by one,” Owens writes.
As 
the 
baritone 
and 
tenor 
intone 
this 
final 
line, the boys’ choir erupts 
into 
fearful 
“Hostia 
et 
preces tibi,” the Latin text 
asking God to allow those 
commemorated 
by 
the 
congregation to pass from 
death to life. The beauty 
of the boys’ choirs melody 
juxtaposed with the harsh 
ending of Owen’s poem was 
overwhelming. 
I 
felt 
my 
stomach turn out of both 
horror and disgust as these 
two texts collided.

Britten 
concludes 
with 
Owen’s “Strange Meeting” 
and 
the 
Latin 
text, 
“Requiescant in pace.” The 
baritone and tenor sing the 
last lines of Owen’s poem, 
“Let us sleep,” as the boys’ 
choir and the adult choir 
sing a final “Amen.” After 
over an hour of the dark, 
somber, alarming material 
Britten previously provided, 
this ending is arresting in its 
simplicity and its beauty. It 
was a final prayer for peace, 
an urgent cry for change 
in a world that seems all to 
accepting of mass violence.
Harmonically, 
Britten 
centers 
the 
entire 
work 
around the tritone. This 
interval is considered to 
be the most harmonically 
dissonant of all intervals. 
In 
the 
18th-century, 
it 
was referred to by some as 
“diabolus in musica,” “the 
Devil in music.” This is the 
harmonic 
guiding 
force 
behind the tension in the 
piece. At the conclusion, 
Britten 
harmonizes 
the 
tritone 
in 
an 
almost 
consonant 
manner; 
the 
audience member thus finds 
some semblance of closure 
in the most dissonant of all 
harmonic intervals.
Though this performance 
lacked at times, the strength 
of Britten’s writing easily 
negated any such problems. 
The soloists, for example, 
were slightly buried in the 
text at some moments. Had 
I not been provided a copy 
of the libretto, along with 
an English translation of the 
Latin texts, it would have 
been hard to distinguish 
what they were saying at 
times. The orchestra also 
struggled 
with 
balance 
at a couple of points. The 
mallet 
percussions 
parts, 
furthermore, were a little 
too loud for my taste — the 
metal instruments struck at 
an almost painful volume.
Thinking back on this 
performance, 
however, 
it 
is not these shortcomings 
that I will carry with me 
but 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
piece itself. In our world of 
seeming perpetual violence, 
in a country coming up 
on its 17th year of war in 
Afghanistan, 
Britten’s 
message rings true. It was a 
call to action, an exposé on 
our moral shortcomings that 
morphed in the end into an 
urgent plea for peace.

‘War Requiem’ from the
Orchestra is marvelous

Joseph Cecconi’s lifelong competitive drive is paying off

It was the night before the 
United States junior hockey 
team’s last exhibition game at the 
2017 World Juniors tournament, 
and 
Joseph 
Cecconi 
wasn’t 
nervous at all. He probably 
should’ve been.
The Michigan captain — then 
a sophomore playing for his 
country at the World Juniors 
for the first time — knew 
that the final roster spot for a 
defenseman was coming down 
to two players. Thanks to his 
upbringing, Cecconi was ready 
to fight for that last spot.
In that final exhibition game, 
coach Bob Motzko and the rest 
of the staff would be looking 
for one of two players to assert 
themselves as the right choice.
Cecconi knew what he had to 
do to make sure the place went 
to him.
“They pretty much said that 
it was between two guys, and I 
was one of them,” Cecconi said. 
“I just went out there and played 
my game and didn’t hold back 
and hoped for the best.”
As soon as the team arrived 
in Toronto after playing its final 
game in Oshawa, a city 40 miles 
to the east, general manager Jim 
Johannson told Cecconi that he 
had made the team.
“I called my grandpa right 
away, because he was at the 
game in Oshawa and he was 
driving back home,” Cecconi 
said. “I immediately called him, 
it was like 1 or 2 in the morning. 
He answered, then I called my 
dad. It was just — I mean, I was 
expecting to make the team. 
That’s what I wanted to do. I 
wasn’t going in there just hoping 
for whatever, I was expecting to 
make the team.”
Motzko wanted to add a 
defenseman with size to his final 
team and Cecconi — then 6-foot-
2 and 222 pounds — fit the bill.
It 
wasn’t 
the 
most 
glamorous reason to make 
a team, but Cecconi took 
his opportunity and ran 
with it.
He 
became 
an 
integral part of a team 
that went undefeated 
through the group 
stage and defeated 
host 
country 
Canada for the 
gold medal. 
“Joe was 
quietly 

probably one of our most steady 
competitors as a defenseman and 
just played a huge role for us on 
that team to win a gold medal,” 
Motzko said. “I remember after 
the tournament, he was one 
of the guys me and the staff 
members 
talked 
about 
like, 
‘What a great surprise,’ because 
he was such a calming force for 
us.”
The 2017 team boasted talent 
up and down the roster, which 
made Cecconi’s selection to the 
team a bit of a surprise. At that 
point in his sophomore season, 
he had only one assist and no 
goals.
Motzko told Cecconi that 
people were talking about him, 
and 
Cecconi 
responded 
by 
playing his traditional, steady 
defense. By the end of the 
tournament, there was no more 
conversation about why he was 
chosen.
Aside from winning the gold 
medal, a moment Cecconi will 
never forget, he took something 
else home from Canada after the 
tournament.
Confidence.
That changed his approach to 
the game when he came back to 
Michigan. Two and a half years 
later, at the end of his senior 
season, he now stands as the 
Wolverines’ 
captain, 
looking 
toward an NHL career — the 
Dallas Stars drafted him in the 
fifth round of the 2015 draft — 
when his time in college comes 
to a close.

When Cecconi first picked up 
a hockey stick at age three, no 
one ever would’ve guessed he’d 
come this far.

Youngstown, N.Y., is not a big 
place — in fact, it’s considered 
a village rather than a city or 
town. It sits a few miles north of 
Niagara Falls and mere feet from 
the shores of Lake Ontario. The 
best restaurant, according to 
Cecconi, is a former gas station 
that now serves pizza. The 
population is barely 2,000 and 
there isn’t a lot going on.
But what is going on is hockey.
“There’s 
like 
three 
restaurants, a Rite Aid,” Cecconi 
said. “That’s the type of town it 
is.”
Buffalo, home of the NHL’s 
Buffalo Sabres, is just over 
half an hour away. There are 
countless minor and midget 
teams in the area, which is 
where Cecconi got his start.
“His dad played hockey, and 
he was on his sister’s little inline 
skates, so he started skating 
around,” said Regina Cecconi, 
Joseph’s 
mother. 
“Hockey’s 
big in our area, so why not 
throw him on the ice, see what 
happens? He’s just been in love 
with it ever since.”
Even before his first organized 
hockey 
experience, 
Cecconi 
gravitated toward the game. He 
always picked the hockey stick 
over the basketball as a child and 
could always be found on skates 
in the winter and rollerblades in 
the summer — when he wasn’t 
playing soccer.
“Outside, inside, always had 
a group of kids in the driveway 
playing hockey,” Regina said. 
“Even the real little kids, he 
would let them play, too, with 
them. One of our neighbors’ dads 
used to dress up in the goalie 
uniform and bring his little kids 
over. Joseph would love skating 
with them.”
In middle school, Cecconi’s 
years of balancing hockey and 
soccer came to an end. Hockey 
was Cecconi’s first love and his 
first priority, and an Achilles 
injury that left him unable to 
run made the decision even 
easier.
He couldn’t run, but he could 
skate. The ice skate held his foot 
in place and didn’t aggravate the 
injury, allowing him to continue 
skating during his recovery. It 
was the only sign he needed 
to switch his full attention to 
hockey.
From there, the kid who used 
to spend his winter on the ice 
and his summer on the soccer 
field spent the entire year on 
skates. If Cecconi wasn’t playing 
for his regular season local 
team, he was playing on an elite 
summer travel team.
It was all hockey, all the time. 
Just how Cecconi wanted it.
But as he rose through the 
levels, it soon became clear that 
his talents may take him farther 
away than his small town or 

even nearby Buffalo.
After spending his whole life 
in Youngstown — where he knew 
everyone, played street hockey 
with his neighbors and was a few 
minutes’ walk from the lake — 
Cecconi had a decision to make.
“I didn’t want to leave home, 
but I was excited to move on 
from playing U16 hockey and to 
probably the best junior hockey 
league in America,” Cecconi 
said. “It was sad to leave my 
friends and family, but I knew if I 
wanted to take hockey seriously, 
I would have to leave. Once I left, 
I didn’t really look back.”
In early 2014, Cecconi moved 
to Muskegon and made his 
debut for the USHL’s Muskegon 
Lumberjacks. 
“That was difficult,” Regina 
said. “That was — Joseph’s a 
momma’s boy and that was 
difficult to let him go, but it 
was something that had to be 
done. We always knew that if 
he had the chance to advance 
and to move up and play the 
game with a higher caliber of 
kids, that he was gonna have 
to leave the area. So, when that 
opportunity came around, it 
wasn’t a lot of discussion as far 
as not going, it was just making 
the arrangements to get him to 
where he needed to be.”
While Muskegon isn’t a huge 
city, it was quite a change from 
the small-town life surrounded 
by friends and family. Suddenly, 
Cecconi went from a town of 
2,000 to a city of 40,000 and left 
behind everyone he knew.
Everything was different. But 
it was for his hockey career, so it 
was worth it. It was an important 
step for Cecconi’s maturity as 
a hockey player, just as leaving 
home to play juniors has been for 
decades of NHL players before 
him.
And it was in Muskegon that 
Cecconi first realized that a 
professional career might be a 
legitimate possibility.
“Growing up, ages like 10 
to 15, I didn’t even know what 
(getting drafted) really was,” 
Cecconi said. “I didn’t know who 
was getting drafted or where 
they were getting drafted from, 
things like that. As I got older, 
I think it was when I went to 
Muskegon in the USHL I kinda 
figured like, ‘Oh, wow. Maybe 
I can do this. I love the game 
so much, why not take full 
advantage of what Muskegon has 
to offer and go from there?’
“Now that it happened and I 
was drafted, which, that was an 
awesome experience, but that 
was a long time ago. Now, I’m just 
looking forward to finishing the 
year and seeing what happens to 
me at the end of the season.”
Going away from home for 
hockey isn’t something that kids 
from Youngstown often do. And 

for most, the NHL is nothing but 
a distant dream.
But now, as his senior season 
draws to a close, Cecconi has a 
chance to take his career to the 
highest level.
***
Regina 
Cecconi 
always 
wanted her kids to be the best 
they could be at their chosen 
activity. Cecconi and his older 
sister Carissa were encouraged to 
be involved in extracurriculars, 
whether that meant playing a 
sport or taking up a musical 
instrument. Cecconi played the 
cello for a couple of years in 
middle school on top of hockey 
and soccer.
His own mother admits that 
he could’ve practiced more, but 
it was important to her that he 
honored his commitment.
Cecconi picked up the cello 
because he thought it looked 
interesting, and when he decided 
he wanted to quit after a couple 
of years, he knew he couldn’t 
tell his mother. Regina believes 
strongly in her kids sticking with 
their activities, so he brought 
the cello home and kept it in 
his room for months — without 
practicing. When Regina looked 
at the calendar and saw an 
upcoming orchestra concert, the 
jig was up. He had to fess up that 
he hadn’t played in months and 
no longer wanted to play.
“She wasn’t thrilled with 
that,” Cecconi said. “I don’t even 
know if I had to pay to return the 
cello for how long I was using it, 
but that was pretty funny.”
And whether it was in the 
orchestra or on the ice, Regina 
always made sure that Cecconi 
was set up to be the best that he 
could be.
Most parents want their kids 
to play sports so that they learn 
to get along with other people 
and be active, and Regina was no 
exception. But she also wanted 
more than that for her son, and 
she made it clear that success 
was a priority.
“My first priority was that he 
was having fun and that he was 
competing with the best kids,” 
Regina said. “He always tried 
out for — I always made him try 
out for the team that was the 
hardest to make. My thing was, 
if he can get a little college out of 
it, that’s a bonus, and the NHL, 
well, that’s always been Joseph’s 
dream.”
By having her son try out 
for the best team and always 
making sure he was heavily 
involved, 
Regina 
instilled 
a 
competitive drive in her son. As 
a competitive person herself, the 
atmosphere in the family was 
one of competition and success.
It’s hard for that not to rub off 
on a young hockey player.
“He’s always been competitive 
when it comes to hockey and 

whatever sport that he was 
playing in,” Regina said. “I’m 
very competitive, I’m very goal-
oriented, so I’d love to say that 
he gets that from me. It’s taught 
in the family and Carissa’s the 
same way. I always tell him, if 
you want to do something, you’re 
just going to have to go after it. If 
that’s what you want to do, then 
just go for it.”
Nowhere has that lesson been 
more poignant for Cecconi than 
when he made the 2017 World 
Juniors team.
After 
attending 
the 
USA 
Hockey summer showcase after 
his freshman year, he knew there 
was a fairly good chance he’d be 
on the preliminary roster for the 
World Juniors. Cecconi wanted 
desperately to be on the team, 
and — just as his mom taught him 
— he went after what he wanted.
And it was there that his 
natural 
competitive 
drive 
began to blend with the inner 
confidence he’d always had. As 
Cecconi moved through the 
World Juniors tournament, his 
confidence continued to grow 
until it became external. His 
ability became more and more 
self-evident as his mental poise 
began to show itself in his play. 
“The first couple games in the 
tournament, I wasn’t playing too 
much,” Cecconi said. “Then, in 
the final couple games, I logged 
a bit of ice time. It just gave me a 
lot more confidence when I came 
back here. I had more confidence 
in my defensive abilities, as well 
as carrying the puck and just my 
poise and control with the puck, 
too.
“I played much better my 
second half of my sophomore 
year and that — going into the 
summer, that just built on. And 
then junior year and now senior 
year, I feel like World Juniors 
really gave me a kickstart to 
being more confident on the ice.”
Confidence 
is 
incredibly 
important in sports, and it’s 
particularly important in hockey. 
One weak pass or tentative move 
to block a shot can change the 
outcome of a game.
If 
you’re 
confident, 
you 
compete harder. If you compete 
harder — and win those battles 
— it increases your confidence. 
As Cecconi’s confidence grew, 
his 
natural 
competitiveness 
increased even more.
It’s been a successful formula 
for the senior as he looks to the 
next step in his career.
“If 
you’re 
not 
wired 
(to 
compete), you kinda just get 
left 
behind,” 
Cecconi 
said. 
“Especially with — in hockey, 
you have to play at U16s and then 
(U18s) and then juniors and then 
maybe stay a couple more years 
and then college. All that.
“You have to be competitive or 
you’ll get left behind.”

For Charles Matthews, newly-minted leader, the time is now

Charles Matthews walked 
into practice last week with 
some words in mind.
The redshirt junior had just 
watched his Michigan team 
travel to State College and lose 
to the Big Ten’s doormat, an 
uninspiring performance from 
a group mired in the thick of the 
race for a conference title. He 
felt there was a lack of effort, 
focus, urgency — and said as 
much when asked about it after 
the game. Then he came into 

practice and told his teammates 
the same thing.
“He was talking about lack 
of discipline,” said sophomore 
forward Isaiah Livers. “Lack of 
personnel — the night before, 
you gotta read your personnel, 
know it’s your guy or potentially 
who you’re gonna guard.”
Livers left unsaid whether the 
Wolverines read those reports 
before the Penn State game. He 
didn’t need to say whether they 
did before Saturday’s 65-52 win 
over Maryland, a game in which 
Michigan’s 
defense 
clamped 
down in a way reminiscent of, 

well, Michigan’s defense.
The Wolverines’ lead built to 
25-10 early on, then plateaued, 
as 
offensive 
stagnation 
allowed 
the 
Terrapins 
back 
within 
three 
points 
midway 
through 
the 
second half. It 
was the defense 
they 
fell 
back 
on, and it was 
the defense that 
proved reliable. 
Over 34 minutes — a team-high 

— Matthews held point guard 
Anthony Cowan just 4-for-
12 from the field with three 
turnovers.
“He shut out 
anybody 
that 
he 
guarded,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein. “Really 
an 
incredible 
performance. 
And 
he 
was 
tired, 
too. 
My 
assistants were 
thinking 
we 
should give him a timeout, and 
I just refused. I’ll call a timeout 
before we get him off the court.”
Beyond 
himself, 
the 
Wolverines’ performance early 
on — laser-focused, disciplined 
and 
jumping 
down 
the 
opposition’s throat — mirrored 
what Matthews stressed after 
Tuesday.
Getting vocal in practice is 
not Charles Matthews’ natural 
domain. During his time at 
Michigan, he has spoken up on 
occasion and with impact, but 
for the most part, Matthews 
has been cast as a leader by 
his actions. When applied to 
an upperclassman on a college 
basketball team, that phrase 
usually means someone is seen 
as a leader because of their age, 
but not much else. As much 
as Matthews has undoubtedly 

helped set a culture for the 
Wolverines, it’s junior guard 
Zavier Simpson whose voice 
is 
the 
loudest 
on 
a 
day-to-
day basis inside 
Michigan’s 
locker room.
That may be 
changing.
“The Charles 
that 
we 
all 
knew 
in 
that 
first 
semester 
is not that same 
Charles,” Livers 
said. “He was more of a leader 
by example. Now he’s starting 
to step up and speak more like a 
Zavier Simpson.”
Michigan couldn’t ask for 
it at a better time. Its play has 
leveled off in the last month. 
After ripping through the first 
12 weeks of the year undefeated, 
the Wolverines have lost three 
times in the last four — and 
they haven’t looked particularly 
good in some of the wins.
Things aren’t about to get 
easier, either. Two of their last 
four regular season games are 
against Michigan State, and 
March is an animal that can’t be 
tackled by a group approaching 
burnout. In what is likely his 
last year of college basketball, 
Matthews has taken it upon 
himself to make sure burnout 
doesn’t happen.

“He’d rather just lead by 
example, but we have such a 
young team,” Beilein said. “We 
don’t even have 
a 
true 
senior 
on 
this 
team. 
Somebody 
has 
to 
do 
— 
we 
need 
another 
voice 
beside 
(Simpson). 
Jon 
(Teske’s) talking 
more, too, but 
still, that’s not 
Jon’s 
deal. 
So 
we need another 
leader. And he’s doing it.”
Matthews declared for the 
NBA Draft last season, waiting 
until the last day to announce 
he would return to Michigan. 
Before this season started, he 
openly acknowledged plans to 
declare again — and this time 
without 
coming 
back. 
This 
isn’t 
technically 
his 
senior 
year, but he can graduate and 
doesn’t seem to long for college 
basketball.
All the signs are pointing in 
the same direction. To what he 
wants out of next month, and to 
why.
“He’s got a sense of urgency 
to win this year,” Beilein said. 
“And make a decision after the 
season, but win this year so that 
he doesn’t look back and say, ‘I 
didn’t do enough in my senior 
year.’ ”

Thome becomes third player in 
‘M’ history to reach 2,000 points

Hallie Thome scored just 
over 1,000 points during her 
illustrious career at Chagrin 
Falls High School.
Entering last Sunday’s game 
against Illinois, the senior center 
needed only one point to surpass 
2,000 points at Michigan. Four 
minutes into the first quarter, 
sophomore Hailey Brown lobbed 
the ball down to Thome on the 
right block. Just as she had done 
countless times before, Thome 
spun around her defender and 
converted the routine layup.
With 
the 
basket, 
Thome 
joined Diane Dietz and Katelynn 
Flaherty — who graduated last 
spring — on the Wolverines’ list 
of 2,000-point scorers.
“It means a lot,” Thome 
said. “It shows a lot about this 
program to have two players do 
it within a year of each other, so 
a lot of the credit should go to the 
coaches here for helping make 
the players so successful.
“And a lot of the credit should 
also go to the point guards we’ve 
had. For me being a post-player 
and not bringing the ball up, so 
it’s all about the guards giving 
you inside touches.”
Added Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico on the WKTA 
Radio show: “It means from the 
minute she stepped on campus, 
she has made an immediate 
impact on our program. She’s 
been such a special player for us. 
I’m just so happy for her because 
she’s 
worked 
so 
incredibly 
hard and I think you saw that 
excitement from her teammates 
as well.”
Despite 
being 
a 
heralded 
recruit — a McDonald’s All-
American 
and 
Ohio’s 
Ms. 
Basketball her senior year — 
Thome never expected to be in 
this position.
“2,000 didn’t seem realistic,” 
Thome said. “To come to college 

and do that is mindblowing 
to me. Then again, credit to 
(assistant coach Melanie Moore) 
on developing me as a player 
to be able to grow and fill the 
shoes Michigan needed as a post-
player.”
Thome burst onto the Big Ten 
scene as a freshman, starting 
all 35 games for the Wolverines. 
She was dominant at times, 
recording a 31-point game and 
nine others with 20 or more. 
Still, compared to Flaherty or 
even Siera Thompson, Thome 
served as a secondary or tertiary 
option.
Thome 
eclipsed 
1,000 
points 
a 
year 
later, becoming 
the 
third 
sophomore 
in 
program history 
to surpass that 
mark. 
Even 
though Thome 
had 
followed 
in 
Dietz 
and 
Flaherty’s 
footsteps through the first half 
of her career, she remained 
skeptical of reaching 2,000.
“I feel like your first two years 
of college are your easiest in 
sports because the other teams 
only play you twice,” Thome 
said. “So they don’t really know 
how to guard you. I thought 
‘Okay, maybe I’ll get to like 1,500 
because people know I love to go 
left, so there goes my left hand.’ ”
Opponents may have learned 
of 
Thome’s 
strengths 
but 
stopping them was a different 
story entirely. Forming a tag-
team 
with 
Flaherty, 
Thome 
increased her point tally to 1,679 
as a junior.
Though 
Thome 
looked 
destined to reach the mark earlier 
this season, injuries, inconsistent 
play and Michigan’s overall 
depth and offensive balance 
have slowed her production. 
Nevertheless, Thome kept a 

positive mindset throughout.
“My injuries were nothing 
compared to what (freshman 
guard) Amy Dilk has faced and 
what 
(senior 
guard) 
Nicole 
Munger has faced,” Thome said. 
“So I’ve just tried to put it into 
perspective and realizing it is 
my last year, always tried to be 
positive. When you get injured, 
it’s easy to get negative and think 
about yourself and everything 
you’re missing out on, and that’s 
when things tend to keep going 
south for you.”
That mentality has paid off 
for her, as Thome has reached 
double-digit 
point totals in five 
of the last seven 
outings.
After finishing 
with 14 against 
the Illini, Thome 
is now just 63 
points away from 
passing Dietz for 
second on the all-
time scoring list 
— an achievement 
that appears likely with three 
regular season games remaining 
before the Big Ten Tournament. 
Flaherty on the other hand, who 
became the all-time leading 
scorer in Michigan basketball 
history last season when she 
passed 
Glen 
Rice, 
remains 
unreachable at the top.
For Thome though, talk of 
legacy and individual accolades 
can wait. Instead, she is more 
concerned with keeping the 
Wolverines’ current win streak 
intact.
“It was never really a concern 
of mine to score 2,000 points,” 
Thome said. “I just wanted to 
make sure our team was sticking 
together and finding a way to win. 
Accomplishing this goal is great 
and everything but it doesn’t 
change me or anything like that. 
Having this accomplishment just 
reflects back on my team and 
how selfless we are.”

He’s got a 
sense of 
urgency to win 
this year.

The night 
before, you 
gotta read your 
personnel...

To come to 
college and 
do that is 
mindblowing...

 Wolverines searching at first base

Well then who’s on first?
Yes.
I mean the fellow’s name.
Who.
The first baseman.
Who.
The 
question 
may 
have 
originated from the famous 1936 
skit, but it holds true 83 years 
later as the Michigan softball 
team asks: who’s on first?
Since 
first 
baseman 
Tera 
Blanco’s graduation last May, 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
has 
been 
searching 
for 
a 
replacement to round out the 
infield.
While Hutchins has stressed 
that there are many players 
being considered for first base, 
sophomore Taylor Bump and 
senior Alex Sobczak seem to be 
among the top contenders, each 
having started at least one of the 
nine games so far this season.
Throughout her career at 
Michigan, Sobczak has served a 
variety of roles in both the infield 
and the outfield, providing the 
Wolverines with strong defense 
from all over of the field. The 
Wolverines have gotten off to 
a rocky start, dropping five of 
their first nine games, and are 
currently unranked for the first 
time in 18 years.
“I’ve seen some good things 
from (Bump and Sobczak), but 
we’re going to need to see more.” 
Hutchins said last Tuesday. 
“When a player asks me ‘What 
can I do?’ Stand out. We’re 
looking for people who are going 
to stand out. The stand-out nine 
are going to be the ones who are 
the most regular.”
In looking for someone to fill 
the role, Hutchins has chosen 
to go back to the basics. She 
emphasizes 
the 
importance 
of fundamentals in seeking a 
starter, but also a player who will 
show assertiveness.
“We need someone on first 
base to help be vocal,” Hutchins 
said. “It’s a vocal position. And 

catch the balls that are thrown. 
That’s the job.”
Added Canfield: “Taylor and 
Alex have both been competing 
for first (base). I think they 
both have their strengths and 
weaknesses but I don’t think any 
of them are so dramatic that it’s 
that noticeable. They’re both 
working hard and doing what 
they can for the team.”
And with both players failing 
to “stand out” thus far, Hutchins 
isn’t limiting her search to those 
two.
“I’m 
looking 
for 
hitters, 
always,” Hutchins said. “We 
need people who can hit through 
the lineup. (Bump) has done a 
nice job there but we’re looking 
at who makes the bag.”
Bump, who has started seven 
of the nine games this season on 
first base, spent her freshman 
season primarily stationed at 
third base, creating an additional 
challenge to her in her new role 
on the other side of the diamond.
“It’s 
always 
a 
challenge 
learning a new position,” Bump 
said. “I knew I wanted to be 
in the lineup and I wanted to 
contribute the best I could this 
year.”
“One thing about switching 
from the left side to the right side 
is learning your range. On the 

left side, you go for everything 
you could possibly get to and at 
first base, you obviously can’t 
because you have to be able to 
retreat to the bag.”
Although the defense has done 
well so far this season with an 
average of .88 errors per game, 
the lineup is far from finalized. 
Going into the third weekend of 
the season, there is no timetable 
for when a consistent lineup 
will appear. But with struggles 
starting to mount, the sooner 
the lineup comes together, the 
better.
“We move people in and 
out,” Hutchins said. “We’ve had 
different (designated players) 
and that’s part of what goes into 
a 56-game season. We don’t have 
a totally set lineup. It would be 
nice to have one and I’d hope 
we’d have one by the time we 
get to Big Ten play. Some years it 
doesn’t work that way.”
These fluctuations don’t seem 
to bother the players who know 
this as par for the course. It may 
be frustrating but that’s what the 
Wolverines must do to return to 
a .500 record.
“I think people are just 
getting comfortable,” Bump said. 
“That’s what our game is. Our 
game is adjusting and adjusting 
to adversity.”

The search to understand 
online grief and digital melancholy


I 

planned my dream wed-
ding when I was 6 years old. I had 
met my soulmate in my kinder-
garten class, and I was positive that our 
love was going to last forever. Because of 
my deep passion for organizing, my only 
clear option was to figure out every nitty-
gritty detail of when and where we would 
tie the knot.
Summer or Winter? Summer. The wed-
ding will be outside, so it must be gor-
geous out.
Big or small? Big, with everyone I know 
in attendance.
First dance? To “If We Were a Movie” 
by Hannah Montana. Does it get more 
romantic than that?
It sounds absurd, I know.
But the idea of the beautiful white dress 
and a shiny diamond ring was something 
I knew I wanted since I was introduced 
to the concept of marriage. I had my par-

ents’ 
relation-
ship as my 
one true guide 
as to what mar-
riage looks like, and 
they were happily in love. My 
mom and dad are the kind of people who 
do what they can to constantly keep their 
romance alive. They always acted — and 
still do — as if they were two teens who 
just recently fell for each other, forever 
stuck in the honeymoon period. My dad 
would bring my mom home flowers just 
to remind her how much he loves her. My 
mom would surprise him with random 
subscriptions to * Blank * of the Month 
clubs, a gesture that undoubtedly paral-
lels his bouquet of roses. Whether it was 
the hot sauce, bacon or beer, her gifts 
were the most romantic thing my father 
could ask for.
They never left the house, hung up the 
phone, or said goodbye without saying, “I 
love you.”
Their evident happiness was what 
marriage was to me. I thought no differ-
ently for any other married couple.

With everyone around me seemingly 
following this path, life to me went as 
followed: grow up, go to college, settle 
down, get married. Marriage was the 
utmost kick-starter to a normal, happy 
life. It was the key to a successful future 
— an end goal that I had to dedicate my 
life to.
Find the perfect life partner, find the 
perfect diamond ring, find the perfect 
white dress, and you’re all set. I had 
never thought otherwise until middle 
school, when I started watching a major-
ity of my friends’ parents get divorced. 
To put a number on it, in the course of 
three years, the “happy” parents of six 
of my friends decided to end their mar-
riage. And I started questioning.
If marriage is truly centered around 
the idea of everlasting love, why do 
almost one in two marriages end in 
divorce?
It’s a question that still lingers with me 
to this day, becoming deeper and more 
complex as I further explore the topic. 
With research, I learned the implica-
tions behind matrimony and the benefits 
embedded in its original purpose. Mar-
riage began as a method of forming alli-
ances among between families, often as a 
strategic tactic in maintaining social sta-
tus in society. Marriages often involved 
dowries, or a basic trade involving money 
or property in exchange for the potential 
spouse. The beautiful white dresses we 
fantasize over about weren’t popularized 
until the marriage of Queen Victoria in 
the 1840s. The diamond rings we pray for 
weren’t tradition for the everyday person 
until De Beers changed their marketing 
tactics to increase profits in the 1930s. 
The glorification of marriage as the be-
all and end-all to happiness is a modern 
idea, disregarding the methodical and 
capitalistic reasons behind the institu-
tion.
Society has conditioned people, specif-
ically young girls, from childhood to for-
get these truths and romanticize the idea 
of marriage. It is made out to be a desir-
able fairy tale that, without it, would lead 
to a boring, miserable life of loneliness.

Though few married couples would 
admit they give into this sad truth, one 
would be ostracized for thinking other-
wise. Single parents have a stigma fol-
lowing them everywhere; couples with 
children but without a license to prove 
their love for each other are condemned. 
But the idea of marriage is inherently 
flawed within itself. It has been mis-
construed from its initial purpose and 
twisted into something straight out of a 
romantic comedy or Disney film.
To many, a relationship isn’t valid 
until the couple has said their vows, and 
love isn’t real until there is a wedding to 
prove it. But if the historical institution 
of marriage only entails a dowry and a 
tax write-off, why should people be so 
quick to give into the myth that it is the 
only way to confirm true love? A couple 
should not need a beautiful white wed-
ding dress and a shiny diamond ring to 
prove to society their love. A happy life 
should not center around a piece of paper 
claiming wedlock.
I’ve come to realize that the real con-
cept that I’ve been longing for since I was 
little was not the white dress or diamond 
ring, and definitely not the idea of mar-
riage itself. Instead, what I want is the 
love that always feels spontaneous, the 
love that always feels genuine, the love 
that always feels real. That is what my 
parents have, and somewhere along the 
way, I mistakenly attributed the unique-
ness that defines their relationship to the 
mere fact that they were married.
I may no longer know what time of 
year I plan to get married in, the size of 
the potential wedding, or the song for my 
first dance (though Hannah Montana is a 
superstar and I can’t help but let my ini-
tial choice stick). To be completely hon-
est, I’m not even positive that I want to 
get married in general. My kindergarten 
wedding was based on high hopes and 
good intentions, but I’ve come to realize 
the fantasy I hoped for has shifted.
My 6-year-old self dreamed of a perfect 
wedding. My 18-year-old self dreams of 
authentic love and happiness, regardless 
of what society deems “recognizable.”

ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTINE JEGARL

I

magine having a secret for most 
of your life you have wanted to 
tell someone for so long, but are 
afraid of what might happen if you share 
it. This was me. Until today. Today, I am 
going to stop feeling alone, and embrace 
who I am as a person — I am gay. This 
is something I’ve known for a very long 
time, but have been too afraid to share.
Ever since I was young, I had a plan 
for my future. I imagined having a lov-
ing wife, happy kids and a fitting job. My 
plan was detailed in this way because 
this is what I was exposed to throughout 
my childhood from television programs, 
friends and social media. Growing up, I 
always liked guys as friends but it took 
me some time to realize it wasn’t only 
as friends — I had feelings for them, too. 
During my junior year of high school, 
I started to have the idea I was gay. 
But when I would have this thought, I 
immediately tried to deny it, as I knew 
this “plan” would not be able to exist. I 
thought if I was openly gay, it would be 
impossible to find love or a secure job. 
This state of denial that I was in last-
ed for many years. Until very recently, 
actually. And one of the reasons I believe 

this denial lasted so long is because I did 
not, and still do not, identify with how 
the media portrays gay people.
In television, movies, interviews and 
social media, gay people are all seen in 
a similar fashion. They are portrayed 
with a feminine look, their only interests 
revolve around the arts and they only 
have only female friends. While some 
gay men do identify with this descrip-
tion, I believe there is much more than 
one personality type for a sexuality. You 
can carry some of these traits, or none 
of them at all. While I am still a fan of 
Broadway (typically seen as an effemi-
nate trope), I also enjoy sports, as well 
as hanging out with guys — more typi-
cally masculine traits. And because the 
media views gay men with one specific 
label, so does the public, who interact 
with different forms of media on a daily 
basis. Even though there are plenty of 
people who can relate to this character-
ization, I cannot. Until I got to the Uni-
versity of Michigan, I only saw people 
who are gay in one light.
Finding my place at the University, 
as well as my group of friends, allowed 
me to feel more like myself. And while 

that helped, I always thought there was 
something missing — something I was 
hiding from the people around me. And 
over the past two years at the Univer-
sity, I discovered new aspects of my per-
sonality, and now my sexuality. But now 
that I have discovered this new part of 
who I am, I want the world to know I am 
the same person as before.
Many times when people “come out” 
to the world, people look at and treat 
them differently because of their sexu-
ality. I have to admit, there was a point 
in time where I may have been guilty of 
doing the same. But I want to say to my 
friends, family and to the world, that 
being gay may change my sexuality, but 
it does not change who I am as a person 
— I am still me.
I am still going to have the same 
friends who will support me through 
difficult times I will face down the road. 
I am still going to dress the same as I did 
yesterday. I am still going to enjoy yell-
ing at Michigan football games when 
Shea Patterson makes a bad play. But 
the biggest difference between yester-
day and today is that I am open about a 
secret I have not only been hiding from 

the world, but also from myself.
I will be straightforward and say the 
next few months will be an adjustment. 
Not only for me, but also for my family 
and friends. Yes, there are people who 
may have had an idea for some time that 
I might be gay, but I am sure some peo-
ple who I interact with on a daily basis 
would not have expected it. By sharing 
my secret with the world, I hope I will 
be able to ease my anxieties and worries 
about keeping this secret from practi-
cally everyone.
For years, I never told anyone about 
my sexuality. I interacted with peo-
ple every day, and I felt like there was 
something missing. But I am happy to 
say that I have decided to finally be true 
to myself and to stop pretending to be 
someone I’m not. I now realize there is 
not one description of what being gay 
is supposed to look like. There are mil-
lions of different labels and every per-
son has their own. I spent a long time in 
denial about something that makes up a 
major part of who I am as an individual, 
but today I am proud to have “come out” 
to the world about who I really am.

Coming out with a secret


cells committing mass suicide.”
Internet humor is primarily based on find-
ing the specific absurdities in everyday life 
and spinning it into something everyone can 
relate to on a certain level. In the case of @
jovanmhill, who has 115 followers, a lot of 
that humor is based on the way he laments 
disturbing truths about his personal life. For 
better or worse, joking about mental health 
has become a primary avenue for people to 
forge an online community of shared suf-
fering, much like with finstas. The only dif-
ference is that everyone’s sadness becomes 
much more publicized and therefore harder 
to contain. 
“At first, it acts as a net where you feel 
validated and stand up for yourself more,” 
Merritt said. “But at the same time, when 
you transfer how you feel to this online com-
munity, you sort of alienate yourself in a way 
from the rest of the world. It turns from, ‘This 
community understands me’ to, ‘No one else 
does.’”
“It helps to see that other people are going 
through similar things and provides expo-
sure and perspective to it,” Brandon com-
mented. “But at the same time, it kind of 
enables it because I think there’s definitely a 
way in which we can romanticize it.”
Having a strong internet presence relies 
a lot on not only maintaining a brand, but a 
banter with followers. Twitter is particularly 
intriguing in how it breeds conversations 
between different accounts that share similar 
interests or, in this particular context, a col-
lective misery.
“The only reason you’re connected is 
because of your problems and they want to 
maintain that community,” Merritt said. “If 
you all of a sudden are like, ‘Oh, I’m better, I 
had an excellent day,’ you’re no longer relat-
able.”
LSA senior Regina whose name has been 
changed to protect her social media accounts 
offered a slightly different perspective about 
how Twitter feels like the only reliable source 
of comfort for many.
“Social media is one of the only places to 
connect to people like you about how sad it 
all is. If you do that in real life, people around 
you tend to get more upset than you neces-
sarily want them to be,” Regina said. “It feels 
better to just like, joke about it on the inter-
net, to commiserate in our mutual fucking 
misery. Sure there are tangible solutions, but 
I think we forget how inaccessible and stig-
matized therapy and medicine really are for 
a lot of people.”
As Regina noted, a lack of access to therapy 
and medicines can play a huge role in why 

people are prone to expressing their sadness 
so explicitly on Twitter, especially since the 
internet provides not only a safe space for 
those struggling with trauma or mental ill-
ness, but a free one.
Still, the line between genuinely express-
ing sadness online versus performing sad-
ness for a phantom audience continues to be 
blurred. As Susannah Chandhok, a second-
year doctoral student studying social psy-
chology at the University of Michigan, points 
out, this issue is intrinsic to the way Twitter 
and social media in general is structured.
“The psychological distance that exists 
online can facilitate being more open and 
making saying things you wouldn’t want to 
say face-to-face,” Chandhok said. “But then 
at the same time, it can also facilitate more 
confrontation because there’s more distance 
and people aren’t picking up on verbal cues as 
much as you would be with nonverbal cues.”
The almost uninhibited amount of per-
sonal autonomy that Twitter affords its 
users makes me wonder what lengths people 
are willing to take to talk about their issues 
before it becomes a serious situation — and if 
we, as members of the online community, are 
willing to take the responsibility for the con-
sequences that come with it.
Picking up on these cues are a huge marker 
for differentiating the tone of a tweet from the 
intention, especially in one recent instance 
where rapper Elizabeth Harris, known by 
her stage name Cupcakke, tweeted on Jan. 8: 
“im about to commit suicide.” Known for her 
more raunchy posts, Harris’s alarming tweet 
provoked confusion and unease from her 
fans. After being hospitalized, Harris issued 
an update on Twitter the following day: “I’ve 
been fighting with depression for the longest 
..sorry that I did it public last night but I’m 
ok.”
Harris’ tweet is a rare and harrowing case 
in which someone’s sadness on Twitter is not 
only fully and completely displayed, but done 
so without the heightened pretense of com-
edy. 
W

hile Twitter seems preoccu-
pied with turning communal 
sadness into a fun and often 
juvenile social space, Facebook seems more 
concerned with making collective sadness an 
aggressively earnest force. It’s a place where 
people can band together for the greater good 
of humanity over the most recent and rel-
evant tragedy, whether individual or collec-
tive, on a local scale or global scale.
“For one reason or another, it’s sort of 
developed as a cultural norm to express 
important events online,” Merritt said. “Peo-

ple feel this obligation almost that if someone 
important dies, they have to show that they 
were important, to show their followers that 
they’re grieving about it. They had to leave a 
last memento.”
Facebook users seemed to have adopted 
an unspoken agreement, wherein folks often 
commemorate the death of a family member 
in a lengthy post or sometimes with a simple, 
sentence-length caption along with a picture. 
By and large, their friends will like or com-
ment on the post. The same is usually done 
on Instagram. Because both platforms are 
known for upholding more positive shared 
news or experiences, disclosing the despair 
that fosters from someone’s death or a nation-
al calamity is sometimes the only way in 
which someone can lay their soul bare.
But given that Facebook is built on giv-
ing our friends updates on our lives, there 
is a kind of social pressure that comes with 
partaking in the discourse surrounding seri-
ous subject matter. If you don’t show support 
for someone who has lost a relative, it comes 
off as insensitive. If you don’t acknowledge 
a mass shooting or a death of a pop culture 
figure, it’s almost like you aren’t part of the 
conversation or are uninterested in partici-
pating in it. The same goes for Instagram, 
where announcing the death of a loved one or 
memorializing the anniversary of a national 
tragedy becomes expected. Once again, our 
sadness becomes a spectacle, an easy and 
accessible way to manage the shock of sudden 
disruptions in our lives.
There’s another cost that comes with shar-
ing a bevy of negative information on Face-
book, particularly for those who have clinical 
depression.
According to a 2016 research study con-
ducted by members of the Department of 
Psychology at the University, depression was 
found to be positively correlated with social 
support from Facebook networks when par-
ticipants disclosed negative information, but 
negatively correlated with how much social 
support participants thought they received 
from their Facebook network.
“People with depression actually do 
receive more social support on Facebook, but 
they perceive less, so there’s a mismatch,” 
Chandhok said. “Social media can be a place 
where people find support, can reach out for 
help, but there might be a lack of seeing that 
support, perceiving and being able to benefit 
from it.”
W

hich brings me to my final 
question: Do social media and 
technology make us sadder and 
more vulnerable or simply expose how sad 

and vulnerable we actually are?
Along with the aforementioned paper, a 
recent study conducted by the University 
of Pennsylvania suggests the former, con-
tending that social media use — particu-
larly on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat 
— increases levels of depression and loneli-
ness. But another recent survey reported by 
NBC News indicates that at least 90 percent 
of teens and young adults with symptoms of 
depression go online for information about 
mental health issues, using social media as a 
expository for a therapist.
Perhaps it goes even deeper than the way 
we express sadness. Tim Schwartz, an L.A.-
based artist and digital strategist, figures that 
some of the melancholy we experience online 
stems from the shift in format of the technol-
ogy we use today and our narcissistic obses-
sion with digital technology. He cited the 
“digital Dark Age” as the reason why.
“The digital Dark Age is the idea that if you 
write or print something on paper, paper can 
last 500 years,” Schwartz said. “If you record 
something on film, it can last for a couple hun-
dred years. But we have no long-term backup 
systems for digital information. Hard drives 
last five years. DVDs last 20 years. In order 
to keep information around for a long time, it 
takes a lot of upkeep for digital and we don’t 
actually have standards for how to do it.”
“My thought is that because we’re living in 
this state of euphoric production of informa-
tion,” Schwartz continued, “We just kind of 
don’t worry about the fact that it’s all lost or 
we just kind of internalize it and it’s just there 
and we’ve already decided that we don’t care 
that our things are saved.”
When we are confronted with our emo-
tions, the internet primes us to compartmen-
talize them. The online world becomes our 
coping mechanism, but also a way for us to 
make the transience of the sad moments in 
our lives feel permanent. Perhaps the reason 
online sadness is such a strange phenomenon 
is because there already is a sense of loss built 
into it.
We are constantly seeking the temporary 
gratification that social media provides us 
because there is something missing within 
us. As a result, we latch onto whatever we can 
to make us feel better, whether that’s paint-
ing a happy, flawless portrait of our life online 
or giving the online world the ugliest parts 
of ourselves. It’s a slightly unfortunate real-
ity, but I’d like to think that moderating our 
happiness with our sadness is the best way 
to reconcile with that missing part and hope-
fully leave an imprint that will last forever.

I

t’s no secret that the happy moments 
we post onto the internet are often a 
façade for the sadness we hide from 
ourselves and the rest of the world. Whether 
it’s posting about a job acceptance on Face-
book, a video of partying at a nightclub on 
Snapchat or a photo at an exotic resort on Ins-
tagram, social media acts as a sort of smoke 
screen for our unfulfilled desires. We attempt 
to construct an idealistic, perfected image 
online in order to replace the gritty, flawed 
one that exists in real life.
But what happens when we do broadcast 
that gritty, flawed image online? What hap-
pens when we expose the part of ourselves 
we are so scared to share in the real world 
within our digital communities? How do we 
reckon with being vulnerable and open about 
our sadness without seeming performative?
Through my own deductions from hav-
ing spent a considerable amount of time on 
the internet, there seem to be at least three 
patterns of communicating sadness online. 
The first, most commonly found on Twit-
ter and finstas, comes in the form of dark 
humor, where irony and self-deprecation are 
employed as a vehicle for discussing mental 
health, unrequited love and personal insecu-
rities through unfiltered posts and tongue-in-
cheek memes. The second, most commonly 
found on Facebook and Instagram, comes in 
the form of melancholic sincerity, in which 
the loss of a loved one, the death of an impor-
tant figure in pop culture or the news of a 
national tragedy are commemorated through 
a series of heartfelt, essay-like paragraphs. 
The third, most commonly found on Tumblr, 
aestheticizes sadness under the guise of GIFs 
and pictures that juxtapose intense poems 
and quotes about loneliness and anxiety with 
attractive people crying alone, drinking alco-
hol or smoking cigarettes.
I

n her experience using Tumblr, LSA 
sophomore Rachael Merritt believes 
this third type of online sadness is 
especially unhealthy and toxic.
“On Tumblr, a lot of the time, (people) will 
make something disturbing sound beautiful 
or put a romanticized twist on it,” Merritt 
said. “There are so many pictures of roses on 
Tumblr, roses with blood.” 
“Lana Del Rey shit,” I interjected during 
our conversation. “Oh my God, so much,” she 
replied.
I reference singer-songwriter Lana Del 
Rey simply because her vintage Americana 
aesthetic and gloomy lyrics about love and 
loss are not only perpetuated to a fault on 
Tumblr but are also fetishized, stylized and 
celebrated among her devoted online fan 

base. The artist grew into popularity after 
the release of her 2012 major label debut Born 
to Die, right around the time Tumblr became 
a viral sensation among high school teens. 
Though Del Rey’s music has matured since 
then, her wistful, edgy artistic sensibility, 
matched with the glamorized heartache she 
exuded on Born to Die, left a long-standing 
impact on how internet users perceived their 
own sadness.
By branding sadness through this aesthet-
ic, Del Rey’s nostalgia-heavy iconography 
and other images like it have allowed people, 
not just teen girls, to buy into the idea that 
their sadness is not only valid, but also func-
tions as a kind of cool accessory. People on 
Tumblr who experience mental illness, self-
harm and eating disorders no longer had to 
feel ashamed due to the relatability of the sad 
aesthetic associated with Del Rey embedded 
within that space.
Merritt cited Effy Stonem, a character 
from the popular British TV series “Skins,” as 
another example of how sad culture on Tum-
blr exploits its users by appealing to their 
desire for validation.
“I’ll see a picture of Effy (on Tumblr) and 
she’ll be crying, tears running down her 
face,” Merritt said. “But at the same time, you 
want her life because you idealize her. It’s this 
bizarre thing where you see all these people 
doing negative things, things you relate to 
depression or mental illness or sadness or 
destructive behavior, and kind of glamorizes 
it.”
Tumblr’s obsession with Effy goes beyond 
basic depictions of her expressing grief and 
sadness. There’s a whole subculture dedicat-
ed to her, from fan art to style blogs to com-
prehensive commentary on the psychology 
behind her character’s actions.

As a cultural touchstone that represented 
teenagers who experience depression, anxi-
ety and suicidal ideation, “Skins” as a whole 
remains a prominent source of romanticized 
sad fodder on Tumblr. Along with Effy, the 
show incorporated other characters who 
were known to defy social conventions, which 
included experimenting with drugs and alco-
hol, engaging in casual sex and exhibiting 
antisocial behavior. Like with Del Rey, sub-
communities on Tumblr reframed the insta-
bility of Effy’s and other “Skins” characters’ 
lives into something attractive and exciting 
through which people can live vicariously.
Since Tumblr is known as a platform for 
escapism, pop culture is often used as a can-
vas for those who are most vulnerable and 
misguided to project their anxieties and 
emotions. Tumblr users don’t have to feel as 

ashamed about the darker elements of their 
suffering. Instead, they can find solace in 
their own misery through someone else’s, 
which inevitably realigns their perception of 
sadness from being a seemingly inescapable 
terror to an illusory spectacle.
I

n contrast to how people on Tumblr 
channel their sadness through glam-
orized aesthetics, people with fin-
sta accounts advertise their sadness through 
unfiltered journal entries. “Finstas” — a port-
manteau of “fake” and “Insta” — refer to an 
exclusive Instagram account users create to 
share a more vulnerable side of themselves 
only for their closest friends to see.
Like an updated version of LiveJournal 
from the mid-aughts, finstas operate as a sort 
of secret haven, where people can talk about 
their most intimate thoughts, ranging from 
newly developed romantic crushes and fam-
ily issues to frustrations with friends and 
mental health. They can also be a fun way for 
the select group of people who follows you 
to see your flaws without fear of judgment, 
a reassuring alternative to Instagram, where 
the quantity of likes and comments tend to 
dictate self-worth. But similar to Tumblr’s 
detrimental reinforcement of one’s sadness, 
there is a drawback that comes with finstas 
if they’re used for the sole purpose of getting 
something off your chest.
I discovered finstas at the beginning of 
sophomore year, right about when they 
started trending on campus. Seeing that my 
friends had their own finstas, I decided to 
make one for myself. For two years, I created 
a litany of posts with lengthy captions about 
getting rejected, complaining about my heavy 
load of homework, venting about my fraught 
emotional well-being and my frustrations 
with my family. Sometimes, these posts were 
laced with irony and self-deprecation. Other 
times, they were much more open and honest. 
There were some posts that contained a mix 
of both humor and sincerity.
Even though I knew deep down that the 
constant reinforcement wasn’t good for me, 
getting a like on my finsta meant more to me 
than getting a like on an Instagram post. A 
like on a finsta post meant that people were 
actually seeing me for me, as opposed to the 
“me” I built on my real Instagram. A com-
ment was an even greater gift. It meant that 
someone was compelled enough to reveal 
themself and acknowledge this hidden facet 
of my inner world.
Toward the end of junior year, I accepted 
the fact that perhaps I was oversharing a bit 
on my finsta and took a break from posting. 
Despite the attention that comes with shame-

lessly telling secrets to a small group of close 
friends, there’s only so much you can share 
about yourself to the point where you no 
longer feel like you’re doing this just for you. 
You become aware of the fact that there is an 
audience of people you trust examining your 
posts and expecting you to churn out a spe-
cific type of content. It almost feels a bit like 
schadenfreude, but even more twisted and 
sadistic. People take pleasure from watching 
you joke about your pain, just as much as you 
take pleasure from giving them that satisfac-
tion. It is no longer just an ephemeral form of 
catharsis, but rather a comfortable self-indul-
gence.
“Over time, you get a community of people 
who slowly understand you and that you feel 
supported by, but that doesn’t necessarily 
fix anything,” Merritt mentioned. “They’re 
there to comfort you always, but it’s not like a 
real sort of comfort that helps you.”
Sadness can be a wonderful thing when 
we recognize it as a shared, universal expe-
rience. But as evidenced by Tumblr and fin-
stas, online sadness can be tricky and messy 
based on how it distorts the way we deal with 
our demons. The constant tension between 
the real feelings we put out into the digital 
world and the artifice of the digital world 
itself presents a troubling question: Can we 
ever truly be genuine about our sadness if 
the medium through which we express it is 
manufactured?

hich brings me to Twitter, per-
haps the most fascinating and 
depressing online space for 
expressing sadness. In the same way that fin-
stas allow people to rid themselves of their 
deepest, darkest thoughts, the anonymity of 
Twitter gives users a platform to eradicate 
those icky feelings to the extreme, sometimes 
without any repercussions.
“I’m always surprised by how willing peo-
ple are to share,” LSA senior Brandon whose 
name has been changed to protect his social 
media accounts said. “I see people tweeting 
about being back at some mental health insti-
tution or, ‘Yeah, I just took some pills.’ It’s 
kind of insane.”
Brandon is referring to a subculture on 
Twitter that circulates provocative and often 
risqué tweets regarding issues of mental 
health.

henever I realize I need a 
haircut, it always takes me 
a few days to get around to 
booking it. First, because I always have 
something to do and often forget, but also 
because it takes a certain amount of cour-
age for me to decide that I want to go to 
a place where I will be expected to make 
small talk with a stranger.
Growing up, I always got my haircut 
with the same person. My mom’s best 
friend. We went to her house, I told her 
how to cut my hair and then she and my 
mom talked while I sat quietly, getting 
layers or bangs or whatever the style was 
that I felt like experimenting with, which 
almost always ended up being 
mostly the same, but a little dif-
ferent — anything to make me feel 
innovative.
My taste for safe innovation 
extends to my social interactions. 
Small talk is not bad as long as I am 
free to leave whenever I deem the 
conversation over. Strangers are 
not bad as long as there is a possibil-
ity that we will eventually move on 
from small talk onto something less 
circular. But being forced to have 
endless small talk with a stranger, 
while being stuck on a rotating 
chair? That’s a no from me.
The entire experience is curated. 
The moment I open the door, I am 
hit by the smell of a perfectly pun-
gent lavender eucalyptus oil, and 
then I turn and make eye contact 
with the receptionist. She smiles 
as if she’s known me for years and 
asks my name. “Did you have an 
appointment?” she says, her voice 
trailing off as she looks for my name 
in the system and some indecipher-
able last name matches her search.
“Would you like some water or 
tea?” she asks. I say tea and she 
turns to get it, but another custom-
er is already at the door. She promptly 
forgets her offer and goes on with her day 
searching names on a computer, offer-
ing tea and smiling to an endless flow of 
strangers.
When my stylist comes downstairs 
and calls my name, I realize she was the 
woman who cut my hair last time I was 
here a few months ago. However, she 
greets me again like a stranger, says her 
name and locks my eyes with hers in a 
more-than-brief moment.
Once she seated me in the chair, my 
cape on and hair wet, she asks me again 

if I would like some tea or water. I say tea 
again, and minutes later she comes back 
with a mug of room temperature water, 
explaining they have just run out of tea. 
I say it is ok and she proceeds to cut my 
hair in silence.
With every cut I expect her to initiate 
a conversation, but she never does. I’m 
secretly grateful and pull out my phone, 
but her head placement directions quick-
ly prove scrolling impossible. Then, with 
no other options and a lot of intrinsic 
curiosity, I start looking at and listening 
to what is going on around me.
The music playing overhead is happy 
but unrecognizable over the myriad of 

voices and hair dryers functioning on the 
floor. After a second of silence, while the 
queue organizes itself, I hear a customer 
behind me recognize and start singing 
the new song playing through the speak-
ers.
“Uh, let’s go to the beach, each…”
“Let’s go get away.” The stylist contin-
ues while swaying his hips but keeping 
his steady hands at bay. I recognize the 
song too, a 2012 hit I remember from high 
school dances. Suddenly, from my omni-
present mirror that somehow, through 
one reflection or other, can observe 

almost everyone in the room, I see heads 
bobbing, mouths moving and feet tapping 
to the song.
“Starships were meant to fly.”
The customer behind me gets more 
excited as the chorus comes for the first 
time; “Hands up and touch the sky,” she 
sings. I can tell the words came out loud-
er than she intended because she and her 
stylist let out a nervous laugh afterwards.
In the station next to me, the stylist, 
whose name remains a mystery, as she 
is referred to differently by almost every 
person who addresses her, has a light up 
crystal plugged in at her station for “good 
vibes.” She is cutting another girl’s hair 

while talking about her own engagement 
and Netflix habits.
“My fiancé and I just started watch-
ing ‘Breaking Bad,’” she says. “It is such 
a good show, but depending on what kind 
of shows you’re into.”
Thanks to my mirror, I can also see a 
girl and her stylist working away two 
rows behind me. I am not sure how I can 
hear them, but they’re talking about the 
woman’s love life.
“He’s 38 and I am 23,” the girl says. 
“I kind of like the age difference. It has 
never been a huge problem.”

The stylist’s eyes widen as he registers 
his customer’s situation and then he says 
something along the lines of giving her a 
discount on a blow out, for extra confi-
dence on her date with an older man.
Next to them is a stylist with an older 
customer, seemingly the oldest in the 
salon. Her hair is short and gray and her 
face is beautifully drawn in with wrin-
kles. I can’t piece together what she is 
saying, but her lips never stop moving and 
her and her stylist let out a laugh once in 
a while. She leaves before me, with a per-
fectly inert and spiky pixie cut.
My hair is being dried now, and my 
stylist asks if I have a preference on how 
to style it. I say no and she proceeds 
to dry and curl my hair to her lik-
ing. By this time, I can already feel 
the hairs that, despite the cape, got 
stuck to my neck and sweater. As 
a distraction, I continue to let my 
ears and eyes wander into other 
stylists’ stations.
The customer who loves “Star-
ships” is gone and a long-haired, 
brunette, middle-aged woman has 
replaced them. The stylist has gone 
to fetch her tea and she sits on her 
chair talking on an old flip phone.
“I think you should buy the 
chicken for tonight,” she talks into 
the phone. “I will probably be here 
for another hour. Would it be too 
much to ask? The store is on your 
way back.”
My hair is almost all curled now 
and my stylist remains quiet, bit-
ing her lip every time she takes a 
new strand onto the curling wand. 
It just started snowing outside and 
I hear one or two people comment 
on the weather in the background. 
I let my imagination fill in the gaps 
between the conversations.
The girl with the blow out went 
on a date with the 38-year-old man 
and she discovered he was married. The 
woman and her fiancé finished “Break-
ing Bad” and started binging “Game of 
Thrones” in their gold and teal decorated 
living room. The brunette lady’s signifi-
cant other didn’t only buy the chicken, 
but they also cooked it and served it with 
accompanying romantic candles and 
chocolate cake for dessert.
I exit the salon with a slightly crooked 
bob and new bangs, but also with a found 
love for haircuts and a few semi-imagi-
nary, new acquaintances.

L

ast year, a friend of mine, who 
had been searching for a girl-
friend for a decade, finally found 
someone. When I heard the wonderful 
news, I texted him, “I’m happy for you.” 
His reply was odd but familiar. He wrote, 
“aww thanks, it’ll happen for you one 
day, don’t worry.” I was slightly irritated. 
I had never expressed that I was search-
ing for a relationship, and his assumption 
that being single was not my choice both-
ered me.
He was not the first one to manifest 
such a bizarre judgment regarding my 
single status. I have gotten used to being 
stereotyped as the lonely, single woman 
who is unable to find love — the future 
“crazy cat lady.” I have internalized these 
social standards by constantly bombard-
ing myself with question: “What if I never 
find someone?”
In reality, I am grossly burned out 
from trying to find a life partner because 
I have had a little too many eerie and 
rather unpleasant experiences with seri-
ous relationships, non-relationships and 
flings. Between the ages of 15 and 20, I 
had four long-term relationships. Until 
August last year, I was technically “sin-
gle,” but in a non-labeled relationship 
with someone. In other words, I have 
gone to great lengths to eschew the for-
lorn psychological state widely known as 
“loneliness.”
As a teenager, I settled for incompat-
ibility, convincing myself that being 
slightly unhappy was better than soli-
tude and loneliness. I jumped from one 
dysfunctional relationship into another, 
seeking another person every time I was 
encumbered with the emotional vacuum 
and fresh scars of a breakup. Allowing 
myself room to breathe, grow and devel-
op myself was not an option.
At 16, my first serious relationship 
ended somewhere between hell and the 
wildfire that wrecked the Battle of Black-
water (Game of Thrones, Season 2). Its 
repercussions demolished my sense of 
self-worth, which expectedly takes time 
to recover from. But I wasn’t one to stop 
dating. I entered another serious long-
distance relationship. The three months 
between my first two relationships felt 
like purgatory gaps in my search to find 
“the one.”
Romance was my main priority in my 
teenage years because the vignette of a 
partner heavily imprinted my vision of 
an enviable adult life. I grew up watch-
ing romantic comedies, both of the Bol-
lywood and Hollywood variety, which all 
end with a grand reconciliation between 
the male and female protagonists. Even 
the “happily ever after” in Disney prin-

cess movies depicts romantic partner-
ship as the basis of a happy life. The word 
“couple” remains an essential component 
of the socially sanctioned boxes of adult-
hood that include a real job, a house, a 
family and, of course, a partner. Like 
myself, many friends of mine entered 
toxic relationships and stayed in them for 
long periods of time.
When imagining myself single, I visu-
alized a lonely woman, sitting on the floor 
with Chinese take-out and cheap wine, 
blinking tears as the tragic cloud that 
reads, “You are alone” settles around her 
aura. I was apprehensive of an embar-
rassing scenario — having only my par-
ents to call when I got into colleges. But, 
since I always had a boyfriend during 
that time in my life, I would deem myself 
lucky that I wouldn’t have to do that. Yet, 
my relationships ironically brought lone-
liness and insecurity into my life.
I was perfectly happy with my friends 
and family until I stumbled upon the 
repetitive relationship syndrome. My 
self-confidence went missing, and I 
wavered with bitterness and fragility. I 
spent nights wondering if someone was 
cheating on me. Days unfolded in horrid 
blurs, arguments and tears. But I deli-
cately camouflaged the negative aspects 
of my relationships under the shiny 
wrapper called “love.”
I was too spellbound with the idea 
of having a boyfriend to recognize the 
infringement on my personal develop-
ment every time I embarked upon a jour-
ney to share love with someone else. But 
when my last relationship met its dis-
tasteful demise, I celebrated my newly 
acquired singledom as a marker of free-
dom to casually date whomever I want. 
My divorce from relationships lead to the 
“party girl” lifestyle.
In today’s millennial world, being 
single envelopes the hook-up culture, 
in an effort to free the term from an 
association with isolation. As a result, 
non-relationships have become the new 
relationships. I frivolously dove into 
a rampage of “friends with benefits” 
arrangements. I would have frolicking 
hook-ups that would turn into a salacious 
game of “who’s going to be the first one 
to text.” My non-relationships eventu-
ally involved the same amount of work 
as relationships, except with a confus-
ing headache that emerges with the gray 
area.
My mind would perform gymnastics 
with thoughts like, “Should I message 
him now? I don’t want him to think I’m 
his girlfriend. He’s not my boyfriend, 
I can’t randomly message him on a 
Wednesday night.” Non-relationships 

weren’t the “chill” I expected. It was the 
same as relationships, except without 
a label. It was like trespassing the same 
danger zone with a “lifeguard” Hallow-
een costume.
During this phase of my love life, going 
home alone on weekends was another 
scenario I dreaded. Finding someone at a 
party to fulfill my sexual needs was my 
definition of being single. Men flocked to 
my life like pigeons, and I considered it 
my pride. But I knowingly resented the 
pressure of having to text a man when I 
just wanted to be alone. In some ways, I 
loved the idea of attention more than the 
attention itself.
After two years, I realized that I was 
paradoxically sustaining the ideals of 
finding a partner that I hoped to dispense 
from my ideological landscapes. I was 
denying myself that room I needed to 
breathe and learn who I am and what I 
want from my life.
Last August, I moved into a studio 
apartment and decided to concentrate 
on myself rather than men, sex, love and 
relationships. Alas! I discovered what it 
means to be single and happy. I 
began watching more television, read-
ing more books, talking to my parents 
and friends whom I had lost touch with. 

Strangely, I didn’t feel that void I pre-
dicted I would feel if I were single. There 
has been a surge in my independence and 
I finally have headspace to think about 
the different things I can do with my 
life. I even began writing and publishing, 
and I discovered domains of my life that 
brought me pleasure and satisfaction.
I’m not saying relationships always 
blind individuals from unearthing their 
own inner potential. But we often feel 
this need to be with someone else, and 
thereby forget that self-sufficiency and 
self-love are important dimensions of a 
happy adult life. I enforced this require-
ment in my life at the cost of subjugat-
ing my personal fulfillment. Though I 
don’t regret any relationships, I am glad I 
finally went on hiatus from them a hiatus 
from them. Every significant moment of 
my life, such as graduating high school, 
leaving Bangladesh for boarding school 
and beginning college, involved a part-
ner.
Three months away from graduating 
college, I truly feel refreshed and ready 
to start a new life by myself. For now, it is 
me, myself and I, on my couch relishing 
chicken wings, tacos and ice cream. And 
I couldn’t love it more.
