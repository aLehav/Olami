STRUNG OUT


Student government
teams with South
Asian Awareness
Network for events
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Dafly Staff Reporter
The Central Student Govern-
ment has joined forces with the
South Asian Awareness Network
to advance social justice on cam-
pus.
Last week, the CSG Assembly
passed a resolution that formal-
ized a partnership between SAAN
and the legislative assembly. In
return for a $1,750 sponsorship
from the assembly, SAAN will
promote social-justice events
hosted by CSG, and two members
from the assembly will serve as
ex-officio members on the SAAN
board.
While the majority of student
organizations apply for funding
through the Student Organiza-
tion Funding Commission - the
executive commission respon-
sible for distributing funds to
student organizations based on
established need - the resolu-
tion established that CSG would
sponsor and support SAAN for
the academic year. The $1,750
would go toward supporting the
annual SAAN conference in Jan-
uary.
A partnership with SAAN, out
of all the active organizations
that focus on social justice, was
far from arbitrary. LSA sopho-
more Meagan Shokar, vice speak-
er of the assembly and co-author

of the resolution, said a partners
will give the assembly access to
SAAN's vast network.
"SAAN has a really strong
message and a really strong
network that they've already
- created in the social justice com-
munity on campus," Shokar said.
"It's an issue that isn't really
brought up enough unless you
really seek it."
The resolution also established
a partnership between SAAN and
the newly created Commission on
Social Justice. -
LSA sophomore Arielle Wis-
baum, chair of the Commission
on Social Justice, said her goal
1 over the course of the year was to
bridge the gap between organiza-
tions that work on social justice
1 on campus and CSG.
As per a new structure instat-
ed by CSG in August, all execu-
tive commissions are researching
1 and preparing reports Ion proj-
ects they will be undertaking
throughout the course of the
year. A formalized partnership
with SAAN was the first step in
what Wisbaum hopes 'vill be a
greater network.
"I wanted to have the social-
justice organizations realize that
they can use CSG as a resource
f and use it to be more effective,"
r she said. "SAAN is a really good
place if CSG really wants to get
involved with the social-justice
community."
As the SAAN talks- - biweekly
t dialogues hosted by SAAN that
are dedicated to various social-
justice issues - take place at the
- same time as the weekly commis-
sion meetings, Wisbaum said she

Traffic-calming
measures focus of
City Council
By MATT JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
At the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil meeting Monday night, the
council members attempted to
address concerns that drivers
may be driving recklessly on
city streets.
Council members postponed
a resolution that would attempt
to allay speedy traffic within
the city, specifically within res-
idential areas of concern.
Traffic calming has become
a serious answer to the question

ofspeeding andctraffic concerns.
for many residents. Traffic
calming measures include nar-
rowing oflanes and installation
of speed bumps and neighbor-
hood signs, among otherthings.
For an area to qualify, it must
meet certain requirements,
including having an average
daily traffic flow between 200
and 4,000 vehicles and an 85th
percentile of speed averaging 5
miles per hour above the post-
ed speed limit. The Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority and
Ann Arbor Public Schools will
soon give input regarding the
traffic calming plans for streets
that they use.
The council's resolution
tentatively appropriates about
$55,000 out of the city's general

fund to the cause, and would
amend the budget for the 2014
fiscal year to include the addi-
tion.
Councilmember Sabra Bri-
ere (D-Ward 1) said she has had
personal experience led her to
support the issue.
"There were days I would
stand in the street to allow the
ducks to cross ... because the
traffic wouldn't slow," Briere
said. "One of my neighbors had
the entire front porch ripped
off her house because a car
ran into it ... I would like to see
that we include additional traf-
fic calming measures in every
future budget."
Councilmember Sumi Kaila-
sapathy (D-Ward 1) also spoke
in favor of measures and said

she fears for the quality of life
in such neighborhoods where
speeding and failure to adhere
to traffic standards are com-
monplace.
Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3)
expressed concern about the
haste of the amendment to the
budget and its consequences.
"I would request that we
postpone this until the next -
meeting to get a little more
information on the traffic-
calming program to figure out
how we can fund it for a much
longer duration or, at least, keep
the program in the eyes of the
public for a much longer dura-
tion," Kunselman said. "As
much as I'd like to spend these

Faculty body enters
closed session to
discuss employee
pension plans
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
Much of the weekly meeting
for the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee for University Affairs
was held behind closed doors
after information regarding
procedural changes for manag-
ingemployee retirementsavings
and benefit plans was deemed
confidential until Friday.
Thoughshecouldnotdisclose
details of the closed executive

session, SACUA Chair Karen
Staller described the meeting
afterwards as "a heated, engag-
ing debate."
Four guest speakers
involved in the proposed
changes were invited to share
their perspectives during the
executive session. They will
return for a larger audience at
the Senate Assembly meeting
on Oct. 21.
At that time, the information
and discussion will be'open to
the public. The agenda was also
approved unanimously and will
be used for the meeting.
A memo to faculty and staff
Monday from University Pro-
vost Martha Pollack and several
other administrators said the
University is "deeply commit-

ted" to health of their employ-
ees.
Due to increasing healthcare
costs, the memo said the Uni-
versity is considering changes
to the retirement and health-
care plans available to Universi-
ty staff and faculty, with a final
decision expected by the end of
the semester.
Up to this point, the memo
stated changes to the plans
offered have been "modest"
with a contribution of $236.5
million made to employee
retirement savings accounts
last year. Without cutbacks, the
funds for mission-driven pur-
poses will be restricted, which
would lead to increasing pres-
sure on tuition.

Social Sociologist

Sandra Levitsky is assistant pro-
fessor of sociology and has been
working at the University since
her postdoctoral research fellow-
ship in 2006.
What's different about
Michigan as compared to your
experiences at other
Big Ten schools?
Go Blue! I taught at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin and UCLA.
Each has a very different flavor.
Wisconsin shares with Michi-
gan the love of education. Peo-
ple are really hard working and
earnest in getting a good educa-
tion. It's hard at UCLA because
you're right by the ocean and
people are coming to class in

flip-flops. Students are a little
different in that respect, but a
lot of students are also first-gen-
eration students who are getting
their education there. They're a
very different type of student
to teach-families who have
never had anyone go to college
before. Michigan has a much
more privileged group, and the
best and the brightest here. It's
a pleasure to teach the students
here because they're engaged in
a way I have not seen before.
How has Michigan
impacted your work?
The great thing about Michi-
gan ' is that it's an amazing
intellectual community ... our

colleagues, we just ramp up
the quality of each other's work
to the extent that my work has
deepened and become more
sophisticated is due to being in
an environment where there's a
rich intellectual tradition.
What is your favorite
spot on campus?
I love to be around all coffee
shops. It's a combination of deli-
cious smells, really good snacks
and people just studying and
talking. It's a wonderful combi-
nation that epitomizes the best
of the University.

Proof of citizenship
to be required for
statewide voting
PHOENIX (AP) - Arizona offi-
cials will seek to ban residents from
voting in statewide races if they
can't prove citizenship - a move
that critics called vindictive inlight
of a recent U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that said the state couldn't
require such documentationtocast
ballotsfor federal offices.
The change was announced
Monday by Attorney General
TomHorne and Secretaryof State
Ken Bennett, both Republicans.
"Because Arizona law requires
a registration applicant to pro-
vide evidence of citizenship, reg-
istrants who have not provided

sufficient evidence of citizenship
should not be permitted to vote in-
state and local elections," Horne
wrote in an opinion that was
intended to give guidance on how
to conduct the 2014 elections.
The Supreme Court in June
struck down part of a 2004 voter-
approved state law that required
proof of legal U.S. residency to
vote in any Arizona elections.
The only federal offices on Ari-
zona ballots next year will be U.S.
House seats. If Monday's change
isn't overturned through legal
action, residents whohaven't sub-
mitted proof of citizenship won't
be able vote for such offices as
governor, secretary ofstate, attor-
ney general and candidates for
the state Legislature.
On their ballots, "they would
just be getting the offices that

they're eligible to cast their bal-
lots for," Bennett spokesman Matt
Roberts said.
However, Roberts acknowl-
edged that alegal challenge is likely.
"We'll see how this shakes out,
but elections officials don't get to
wait and see. We'll be implement-
ing," he said.
Dan Pochoda, legal director
for the American Civil Liberties
Union of Arizona, called the move
"ludicrous."
"At a minimum, it's a tremen-
dous waste of resources at a time
when people already are having
to wait too long to vote in this
state and it will deter voting for
no good reason other than a vin-
dictive attitude," Pochoda said.
"There certainly appears to be
possible serious concerns about
legality."

or more parcels of land.
Under the new definition, the
ordinance also states that the
maintenance of all sidewalks
outside of the Downtown Devel-
opment Authority's jurisdiction
would be the responsibility of the
owner of the adjacent properties.
However, owners of properties
that border the cross-lot walks
and already pay property taxes to
the city, are exempt from respon-
sibility.
This exemption came after the
ordinance was sent back for revi-
sion Monday night's meeting. For
the most part, this exempts the
majority of abutting property
owners from responsibility.
However, some property own-
ers will still be liable for main-
taining their cross-lot walks.
The ordinance included the

option for the city to enter into
an agreement with the DDA to
upkeep the sidewalks within the
DDA's territory through June
2017. Otherwise, the city could
treat these sidewalks as side-
walks outside the DDA territory
and make it the responsibility
of property owners, who are not
exempt, to upkeep the sidewalks.
Briere said one of the notewor-
thy changes regards winter dam-
age.
"This ordinance change
doesn't just refine the defini-
tion of sidewalks; it also accepts
those properties adjacent to
those sidewalks are not respon-
sible for (winter damage)," Briere
said. "Four houses divvying up
one sidewalk deciding who has
to (maintain it) would be a prob-
lem."
Renters - including students
- could see a hike in payment
equal to the cost of maintaining
these pathways if certain proper-
ty owners do become responsible
for maintaining these walkways
as a result of the legislation.


Delegation promotes
peace talks during
rare visitto region
RAMALLAH, West Bank
(AP) - A delegation of Israeli
lawmakers paid a rare visit
to the West Bank on Monday
to meet Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas and give an
emotional boost to fledgling
peace talks that have faced
deep skepticism on both sides.
Visiting the same compound
where Israeli troops once laid
siege on late Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, the 10 Israeli
lawmakers pledged support for
the talks that resumed in July
after years of stalemate and
mutual suspicion.
They insisted they were not
in Ramallah in place of official
negotiations, whose content
has remained secret, but rather
to give them a "tailwind" of
support and stress the urgency
of their mission.
"We don't want to believe
that this is the last chance (for
peace) but it may be the last
chance," said Labor Party law-
maker Hilik Bar, who heads the
parliamentary caucus for the
resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. "There is a clear major-
ity for peace among the Israeli
and Palestinian parliaments
and people. We are here to back
the leadership. It is ridiculous
that we won't make peace."
Bar said his caucus was the
largest in parliament with some
40 members across the politi-
cal spectrum. Its aim was to
bridge the "huge gap of under-
standing" between Israelis
and Palestinians and provide a
grassroots support network for
leaders to make peace.
But of the 10 lawmakers who
journeyed to Ramallah, nine
were from the opposition Labor
Party. The other came from
chief negotiator Tzipi Livni's
centrist Hatnuah Party. Several
from the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party withdrew following the
death of their spiritual leader,
Rabbi OvadiaYosef.
A previous delegation of Pal-
estinian lawmakers visited the
Israeli parliament in August, as

part of a similar outreach effort
from the other side.
While previous rounds of
peace talks, particularly in the
1990s, generated widespread
hope and optimism, the current
round has created little excite-
ment. After so many years of
failure and bouts of violence,
neither side seems to be opti-
mistic that the latest talks,
expected to last nine months,
will be successful.
The Palestinians seek the
West Bank, east Jerusalem and
Gaza Strip, territories captured
by Israel in 1967, for their state.
Israeli peace advocates say the
establishment of a Palestinian
state is the only way to preserve
Israel's character as a democra-
cy with a Jewish majority. The
alternative, they say, is a single
state in which Arabs, with their
higher birthrate, will one day
outnumber Jews.
"I think nine months are
enough to reach an agreement
because we have discussed the
issues in previous talks," Abbas
told his guests. "We don't want
blood. We want peace, not
blood."
The visit came days after
a 9-year-old Israeli girl was
shot by a Palestinian gunman
in the West Bank settlement
of Psagot, adjacent to Ramal-
lah. Bar said the attack spurred
some lawmakers to urge the
cancellation of the meeting.
But he said he resisted the calls,
saying that would only serve
the interests of extremists.
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has embraced the
idea of a Palestinian state, but
has also embraced tough posi-
tions in recent speeches.
In a speech Sunday, Netan-
yahu said there will never be
peace until Palestinians recog-
nize Israel as the homeland for
the Jews. The Palestinians have
rejected this demand, saying it
wouldundercutthe fate of refu-
gees who dream of returning to
lost properties in what is now
Israel.
Last week, Netanyahu made
just a passing reference to the
peace talks in a speech to the
U.N., devoting almost the entire
address to Iran's nuclear pro-
gram.

Retain and revitalize
New bill can help prevent outsourcing of Michigan's college graduates
In an attempt to encourage college graduates to stay in Michigan, state
Sen. Glenn Anderson (D-Westland) has sponsored a bill that will offer
a tax credit worth up to 50 percent of the amount paid on student loans
for students who agree to remain in Michigan after graduation. Besides a
tactic to help combat the rapidly increasing student-loan debt, the bill is
aimed to prevent the outsourcing of Michigan's educated youth. While the
program's costs may seem overwhelming, the benefits gained from retained
talent and creation of industry could revitalize the state's economy.

So, I walked through the gro-
cery store the other day and
picked up a box of Pop-Tarts,
not so much
because I want-
ed to buy them,
but more for the
sake of nostal-
gia. I used to eat
Pop-Tarts all the
time when I was
a kid - the cin-
namon kind that KATE
I stuck in the LARAMIE
toaster until they
were all gooey
and delicious. I read the list of ingre-
dients, took a look at the picture on
the front of the package, andthought
to myself: What is a Pop-Tart? Seri-
ously, this is a food we call by its
brand name because we don't have
a better description for it. We don't
know what they're made of or how to
classifythem - kindofstrange if you
think about it.
This weird observation about
Pop-Tarts isn't completely random.
It brings to light the most basic prob-
lemwiththe modernfoodsystem.As
a society, we're completely separated
from our food: where it comes from,
how it's processed and what it's
made with. Even the fruits and veg-
etables that we find at our grocery
stores are too perfect. Our tomatoes
are too red, lacking any blemishes or
bruises. Our potatoes couldn't pos-
sibly have come from the ground, as
they're just too clean to have been
grown in the dirt.
When food is presented in perfect
colors and nice square boxes,we lose
our association with what we eat and
the earth that it comes from. Edu-
cating people about this disconnect
is the heart of the local, sustainable
food movement - a movement that is
alive and well at the University.

Anderson's Senate Bill 408 has the potential
to have widespread effects. The financial bur-
den that student loans impose on individual
college students would be lifted - not only for
current students, but also for future students
who may have avoided a traditional four-year
degree after considering the hefty price-tag.
With college tuition in the United States hav-
ing risen more than 300 percent since 1990,
discouraged prospective students have not
been a surprise - even more so in Michigan,
where tuition has increased by 23.1 percent
since the 2008 academic year alone. The bill's
goals are also directed toward diminishing
the financial woes of the entire state, includ-
ing Detroit. By allowing Michigan graduates to
consider the benefits of reducing their student
loans, the program would lead to an increase
in a young, skilled and educated population.
Prevention, or even mitigation, of Michigan's
"brain drain" would further contribute to a
growing accumulation of an educated work-
force during Michigan's period of revival.
Despite the nature of the legislation pro-

posed being largely optimistic, its impacts
need to be further developed and refined. The
proposed cost totals more than $300 million.
To ensure the program's costs will be ulti-
mately covered by returns on the investment,
the bill will need to incentivize students to
settle in Michigan long-term. Furthermore,
while the bill may be able to convince gradu-
ates to stay and work within the state, jobs
need to be available for these students. As a
preventive measure, the gradual distribution
of tax credits may prove to be an indicative
approach as to whether retained graduates
would be benefitting from the Michigan
employment market.
This bill aims at the right demographic to
improve Michigan's future. The increase of
tuition and subsequent increase of student
loans has paralyzed a generation of students
now unable or, at the very least, unwilling to
remain in Michigan post-graduation. As stu-
dents follow their classmates out of state to
seek better opportunities, this bill seeks to
keep them here or even bring a few back.

these lead up to one of fall's much-
anticipated peaks: Halloween.
Let's step back now and qualify
that last one. Halloween certainly
can't go on my "there's so much to
love about fall" list unconditionally.
I'm not a Halloween enthusiast,
but I have friends who are, and
that's cool - I can appreciate the
spirit. What isn't cool, though, is
what neighborhoods and campuses
across the country are subjected
to every year - unabashed racism
and sexism masked as "fun."
Actually, your ignorance isn't
fun at all. It makes many of your
peers feel unsafe, embarrasses
your school's image and really just
makes you look like a fool.
Below, I offer the "College Stu-
dent's Guide to Not Be a Fool This
Halloween." This is not an exhaus-
tive list, but it's a good place to
start.
1. Do not culturally appropriate.
These days, Halloween and cul-
tural appropriation seem to come
hand-in-hand. Put simply, cul-
tural appropriation is when we use
expressions of cultures, including
clothing and dressing styles, with-
out permission and without giving
due credit. Appropriation is espe-
cially problematic when the source
culture is a minority group that
has time and again been denied its
agency and rendered invisible.
Recent examples of cultural
appropriation include Miley
Cyrus's gig at the MTV Video
Music Awards where she used
Black women's bodies as her props
while performing a song that she
requested from her songwriters to
sound like "something that feels
Black". Other examples include:
Selena Gomez's "Come & Get It"
performance at the MTV Movie
Awards where she sported a spar-
kly bindi, Lady Gaga's "burqa
swag" fetish that utilizes Muslim
women's bodies to sell albums
while wholly ignoring their voices,
and Urban Outfitter's Navajo Hip-
ster fashion items that exploit and

Ryan cleared by doctors

Fixing 3rd down woes

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
chose his words carefully. When
pressed, Hoke said that injured
redshirt junior linebacker Jake
Ryan could "potentially" return
against Penn State on Saturday.
Whether Ryan will actually play
is still uncertain.
For the first time, though,
Hoke acknowledged that Ryan
has received clearance to play
from doctors.
He has taken NOTEBOOK
part in contact
drills in practice. Now, the deci-
sion about when to play Ryan is
up to Hoke and Ryan.
"Believe me, he's wanting to
play," Hoke said. "Seems to feel
OK, but we still need to make sure
that he can do the things that he's
capable of doing."
Ryan tore his anterior cruci-
ate ligament nearly six-and-a-
half months ago at a practice on
March 19. He underwent surgery
a week later on March 26. The
team has said throughout the
process that the target for Ryan's
return is sometime in October.
When Ryan does return, he'll
take some playing time from
junior linebacker Brennen Beyer,
who has been one of the defense's
best players this season. That
will add depth to the strong-side
linebacker position, Hoke said.
He added that Beyer could move
back to defensive end, where
he played his first two seasons,
depending on the personnel and
situation.
When Ryan is healthy, he is
likely the best player on Michi-
gan's defense. Last year, he
recorded 4.5 sacks and 16 tackles
for loss.
Ryan is also a player that should
have a future in the National
Football League. Hoke has said
he wants to be sure Ryan is ready
to return, but Ryan's eagerness to

Redshirt junior linebacker Jake Ryan is getting closer to returning from a torn ACL, an injury he suffered in March.

return can complicate that.
"He wanted to play last week,"
Hoke said. "He wanted to play the
week before. What do you think
he's going to say? 'No, coach, I
don't wanna play."'
As Hoke got up to leave, a
reporter reminded Hoke that
South Carolina defensive end
Jadeveon Clowney asked not to
play in his last game with bruised
ribs.
Hoke continued walking. With
a smile, he said, "I'm not even
going there."
PIPKINS OUT FOR YEAR WITH
ACL TEAR: As speculation over
Ryan's return built, the team
announced Monday that sopho-
more defensive tackle Ondre
Pipkins will miss the rest of the
season with an ACL tear.
"I'm pretty close to him
because I coach him," Hoke
said. "Your heart just goes out to
Ondre."
Pipkins doesn't seem a likely
candidate for a medical redshirt.
The NCAA stipulates that to
receive a medical redshirt, the
player must not play in more than

30 percent of the season. Michi-
gan has passed the 30-percent
mark.
There is one remaining option,
though. NCAA bylaw 14.2.4.2.1
- yes, that's the actual number
- allows for review by a commit-
tee. The rule states, in part, that
a conference may appear to the
Committee on Student-Athlete
Reinstatement, which "shall have
the authority to review and deter-
mine whether to approve the
waiver based on circumstances
that may warrant relief from the
application of the legislated waiv-
er criteria." A spokesman for the
Big Ten onference said a decision
can be appealed, but declined to
comment on any specific cases.
"That's all something that
we'll have to appeal and do all
that stuff with," Hoke said. "It's
way too soon to say it is or isn't."
Hoke mentioned redshirt
junior Richard Ash and redshirt
freshmen Willie Henry and Ryan
Glasgow as players that could see
more time in Pipkins's absence.
LATE-NIGHT TEXTS: At 11:30
p.m. Saturday, Hoke's phone

buzzed with a text from fifth-year
senior left tackle Taylor Lewan.
After beating Minnesota,
Lewan's attention had turned to
the Wolverines' next opponent:
Penn State. Hoke said the mes-
sage read "Coach, it's going to be
loud at Penn State. We need more
crowd noise this week."
Hoke, who said he's relatively
new to texting, replied "OK."
Michigan has struggled on
the road since Hoke took over as
coach. At home, Hoke has never
lost. In away games, though,
Hoke's Michigan teams have
gone 5-6.
Penn State has one of the most
hostile stadium's in the confer-
ence. ("Oh shoot, what a great
place to play," Hoke said of Beaver
Stadium).
The Nittany Lions also have
one of the most talented fresh-
men quarterbacks in the nation
in Christian Hackenberg. Hoke
spoke highly of Hackenberg in his
press conference.
"I'll tell ya, he's very talented,"
Hoke said. "Very talented. He can
spin it. Shows a lot of maturity."

Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner calls it the "money
down," and sophomore linebacker
James Ross III reiterated that
point in Monday's press confer-
ence.
But for all the talk about how
important it is for the Michigan
football team to stop its opponents
on third downs, something still
got lost in translation Saturday
against Minnesota.
Early in the first quarter, the
Golden Gophers took possession
of the ball for their second drive of
the game.
The Wolverines had already
forced a turnover on Minnesota's
previous possession and, with the
Golden Gophers facing a 75-yard
drive, it gave the Michigan
defense confidence it could force
the stop.
Minnesota wasn't quite as will-
ing to give up the ball a second
time, though. On a drive that took
almost 10 minutes, the Golden
Gophers marched down the field.
They converted five consecutive
third downs - two of which came
from Minnesota quarterback
Mitch Leidner, avoiding pressure
by running the ball.
"There's some issue when you
don't tackle well, when you're
reaching instead of running
through," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke after the game. "Some
guys do that just because they
don't want to make a mistake. I'd
rather them be aggressive, run
through and make a mistake."
The Golden Gophers eventually
extended their third-down streak
to seven before Leidner's incom-
plete pass at the beginning of the
second quarter snapped it. Even
though Minnesota converted only
one more third down during the
course of the game, it still raised
questions about why the Wolver-
ines' defense had so much diffi-

culty getting off the field.
After the game, sophomore
cornerback Blake Countess said
the Golden Gophers' continued
success on first and second downs
made it difficult for defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison to call
the right play on third-and-1 or
third-and-2 situations.
Hoke said it wasn't necessar-
ily Mattison's calls that allowed
Minnesota to convert so often, but
rather Leidner's athleticism,espe-
cially with his scrambling ability.
"He'd get out of the pocket and
then we'd miss at tackle," Hoke
said. "I thought there were a cou-
ple interior runs, the four- or five-
yarders that they bled you with a
little bit. We've got to make sure
we're doing a better job in there."
The first quarter time of pos-
session was lopsided in Minne-
sota's favor, 11:14 to 3:46. It evened
out as the game progressed, and
the Wolverines agreed that had
everything to do with stopping
the third downs.
"Well, I think we got bodies to
the ball when (Leidner) did want
to scramble or he did want to run
it," Hoke said. "I don't think there
was anything magical when you
look at game-plan wise changing
things a whole lot."
Hoke said that he would have
preferred to give younger offen-
sive players, especially the run-
ning backs, some more reps. And
as the game slipped further and
further out of Minnesota's fingers,
Saturday could have been the per-
fect opportunity to balance out
the Wolverines' veterans with
youth.
But due to the minimal amount
of time that Michigan held onto
the ball, Hoke's hope for a more
well-rounded offense never quite
panned out.
"We've got to get better time of
possession," Ross said. "That's on
(the defense). We have to get off
the field and set up our offense to
score points."

5 Things We Learned: Waterloo

ByALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily Sports Editor
1. Adjustments need to be
made before Boston College.
The week before the No. 11
Michigan hockey team played
Waterloo (Ont.), Michigan coach
Red Berenson admitted that he
was already looking ahead to the
season-opening clash against No.
4 Boston College. After the Wol-
verines fell to the Warriors, 2-1,
the excitement turned into trepi-
dation.
"Well, it's a little scary," Beren-
son said. "Boston College will
certainly be a whole new chal-
lenge."
Berenson stressed that the
home exhibition helped younger
players grow accustomed to play-
ing a full-speed game against
experienced competition, but the
atmosphere at Yost Ice Arena on
Thursday might not compare.
Thebuilding wili likelybe packed
and roaring when Michigan
welcomes an Eagle squad that
dispatched St. Francis 8-2 in an
exhibition.
Both goals that Michigan
surrendered Sunday came on
team lapses. Senior defenseman
Mac Bennett admitted to los-
ing his man on the first, and no
one cleared the rebound after
sophomore goalkeeper Steve
Racine made an impressive save.
A dynamic 4-on-2 rush led to
the second tally. There's only so
much coaching that can be done
in a week, and the Wolverines
will have to minimize mistakes
that are common this early in the
season to upset Boston College.
2. Freshmen will be key all
year.
Much of Michigan's success
this season will be dependent on
* its freshman class, and it showed
signs of promise on Sunday.
Defenseman Nolan de Jong
and forward J.T. Compher led the
Wolverineswithfive shots apiece,
and goaltender Zach Nagelvoort

looked solid in goal. Defensemen
Kevin Lohan and Michael Down-
ing both saw time on the penalty
kill and helped hold Waterloo to
zero shots despite the Warriors'
six minutes with a man advan-
tage.
Berenson toyed with the lines
to pair freshmen with upper-
classmen and will continue to
experiment early in the season.
But he was impressed with the
new talent, nonetheless.
"They got the feeling they can
play at this level, and they just
need to get ready and get a little
more experience," Berenson said.
"Overall, I thought they were a
positive."
3. It was just an exhibition.
Because of customary NCAA
restrictions, Berenson could
spend little time on the ice with
his team during practices leading
up to the exhibition. The Wolver-
ines also spent Sunday afternoon
experimenting with line combi-
nations and were shorthanded as
junior forward Alex Guptill sat
out due to an off-ice issue.
Michigan may go through
some growing pains against Bos-
ton College, but it's still early in
the season. And the Wolverines
showcased their speed and offen-
sive potential in a game that eas-
ily could have gone either way.
"We're going to come into the
Boston College game with a lot of
confidence," Copp said.
4. Michigan's goaltending is
stable.
Last season, the Wolverines
struggled mightily between the
pipes. Three different players
started in net, and it took most
of the year for sophomore Steve
Racine to emerge from a medio-
cre pack.
Now a sophomore, Racine
holds the No. 1 spot, where he
was reliable in the loss to Water-
loo. Racine surrendered a pair of
goals, both of which came after

short-range shot and was unable

No smash hits for
Cyrus's 'Bangerz'
without 'Wrecking'
By GREG HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
Bangerzseeksto recreate Miley
Cyrus as a new-and-upcoming
hip-hop artist rather than high-
light the former
Disney singer
as an artist
who has merely Bangerz
matured in her
work. Cyrus Miley Cyrus
expressed dis- RCA
dain over all
her material
before this fourth studio album,
stating that she views Bangerz
as her first true album. Why is it,
then, that so much of this record
sounds very familiar?
The Bangerz ballads ("Adore
You," "Maybe You're Right")
could have easily found a place on
the then-Disney star's previous
album, Can't Be Tamed - a record
that proved Cyrus couldn't be
tamed or successful. Both albums
contain awkward song disparities
brought on by leisurely innocent
music behind tasteless, beat-
heavy tracks.

"4x4" combines the Nashville
roots of Cyrus's upbringing with
a bit of synth, which might have
been original if it hadn't also been
attempted on "Two More Lonely
People" from Can't Be Tamed.
The song predictably includes
Nelly, who - between "Cruise"
and "4x4" - has some newfound
fascination with features on
country-pop songs that involve
automobiles.
The album's filler tracks are
vapid even for filler tracks. The
uninspired "Adore You" is barely
worthy of being a Walmart Spe-
cial Edition bonus track, let alone
the lead track on the album. It's
beyond groundless to tear your
reputation to shreds to establish
yourself as a grungy hip-hop art-
ist, only to have the first song on
your album be a lovelorn lullaby
worthy of a spot on Hannah Mon-
tana2:Meet Miley Cyrus.
The production and writing
credits raise an eyebrow over
Bangerz's major pitfalls. Mike
WILL Made It produced eight of
the 16 songs, while Pharrell pro-
duced four others. In theory, this
should be a very coherent hip-
hop album. Yet, here we are, with
Pharrell producing a country jam
("4x4") and Mike WILL Made It
producing a seemingly gospel-

Though it's one of the more
basic pieces on the album - oblig-
atory, given that it's Dr. Luke's
handiwork - "Wrecking Ball"
is Bangerz's savior. Decent chord

T, whose given
name is Ter-
rence Thornton, has been a rap
music fixture since the release
of 2002's Lord Willin', which fea-
tured Pusha rapping alongside his
brother. The Thorntons released
their early material under the
moniker of Clipse, and after three
positively received albums, the
duo disbanded to focus on solo
material. Despite Pusha T's years
of rap credibility, he has never
had the chance to break out into
the mainstream and seize the
spotlight as a solo artist. My Name

attempts to transition Thornton
from slept-on cocaine rapper to
rap-industry heavyweight.
Even the most casual rap fans
will recognize Pusha T's name
from his thunderous guest verse
on Kanye West's "Mercy," one of
the mostubiquitous songs of 2012,
or his scene-stealing feature on
"Runaway," one of the lead singles
off of West's My Beautiful Dark

Thornton's label, G.O.O.D. Music,
has an obvious influence as the
album's executive producer, pro-

and uncredited backing vocals
on "Hold On." Thornton is char-

out of West's shadow and culti-

as the street-smart ex-drug deal-

adjectives arbitrarily pulled out
of a hat (see: glo-fi, trip hop and

plain awful. The idea of noise
pop seems contradictory in the
most obnoxious way imaginable,
like a nil metal Miley Cyrus.
Despite the not-so-positive pre-

the aforementioned, Sleigh Bells
continues to shatter any and all
negative expectations with their
third album, Bitter Rivals.
The title track opens the
album with the most natural
sounds ever to be heard on a
Sleigh Bells album, from the
hard strums of an acoustic gui-
tar all the way down to the bark-
ing dogs in the background,
before lead singer Alexis Krauss
explodes, singing, "It was the

a fitting foundation for Krauss's
combative presence before she
reverts back to her softer side,
gently crooningher waythrough
the chorus.
The back and forth of subtlety
and aggression laid out on the
opening track proves to be the
recurring theme of the album.
"Sing Like a Wire" starts out
with a simple beat as Krauss
softly sings, "static in the sen-
tence, static in the dirt." When

it doesn't go unnoticed. These
captivating contrasts give Bitter
Rivals peaks of varying interest
and moments of surprise, ensur-
ing that no one's attention can
stray far from the album for too
long.
Bitter Rivals also marks the
most melodic shift forward for
the group, with genuinely sing-
able tracks like "Young Leg-
ends" and "Tiger Kit," both of
which show off Krauss's vocal
abilities outside of yelling on

top of the hyper-intense bevy
of instruments. This simplicity
may be due in part to Andrew
Dawson, who mixed the album
and also served as the engineer
for Kanye West's Yeezus earlier
this year - which was noted for
its own stripped-down sound.
The sing-along style of both of
these tracks offers a played-
-down version to the typical
noise-pop genre. Instead, they
explore a refreshing sound
to what the group seemed to
become accustomed to on Reign
of Terror, which came off as too
hyped up for any substance to
shine through.
While Bitter Rivals doesn't
mark a complete departure for
Sleigh Bells, it further proves
that all bands that get classi-
fied under some unintentionally
hilarious subgenre deserve the
flak we'd assume based solely
on the moniker. If anything, the
band proves noise pop is a genre
all its own, and one to be reck-
oned with, at that.
