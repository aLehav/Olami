‘Food Love’ theme 
encourages produce 
awareness, nods to 

Valentine’s Day

By SAMANTHA WINTNER 

and SAMIHA MATIN

For the Daily

University students, together 

with food lovers, entrepreneurs 
and farmers, filled Rackham 

Auditorium on Sunday for the 
seventh annual Local Food Sum-
mit.

Billed as a sustainable food 

conference, the event promot-
ed stronger relationships with 
local food businesses, as well 
as encouraged local entrepre-
neurs to adopt environmentally 
responsible business plans.

“The intent is to bring people 

around local food so that they 
can experience learning from 
multiple different angles,” said 
Ann Arbor resident Jason Fren-

zel, one of the event’s organiz-
ers. “So we have participants 
here who are very new to the 
Local Food Summit and we 
want to allow them an opportu-
nity to meet people who are very 
involved in the system and learn 
a few basics. We also want to 
create opportunities for people 
who are currently involved in 
the system so that they can get a 
chance to increase networking.”

Community 

members stage 
protest for Global 
Divestment Day

Dozens of students and com-

munity members in matching 
bright-orange shirts emblazoned 
with the phrase “Global Divest-
ment Day” rallied on the Diag on 
Friday afternoon in support of 
fossil fuel divestment.

Global Divestment Day was 

sponsored by the Divest and 
Invest campaign, a coalition of 
students, faculty, staff and com-
munity members. The protest 
aimed to urge University officials 
to divest the school’s interests 
from fossil fuel companies.

LSA

and mobilize students in support 
of the cause. He said he believed 

Grand Rapids-

based chain opens 
new location on 
Maynard Street 

By LAURA SCHINAGLE

For the Daily

About 300 people lined up 

outside 311 Maynard St. on 
Saturday 
morning, 
braving 

frigid temperatures and bit-
ing winds, as workers inside 
finished up preparations for 
the grand opening of Hopcat, a 
Grand Rapids-based craft beer 
bar.

The chain, which focuses on 

specialty craft beer and sells 
food as well, announced in 
July that it would open its fifth 
location in the 8,600-square-
foot 
space 
that 
formerly 

housed part of the Borders 
flagship store.

Leading up to the event, 

HopCat advertised that it 

would offer free “crack fries,” 
a signature dish of beer-bat-
tered French fries, during the 
grand opening. It also said the 
first 200 people waiting in line 
would receive free crack fries 
every week for a year.

Though the heat of July may 

have seemed distant on Satur-
day, patrons waiting outside 
— several of whom camped 
out overnight — said they were 
especially looking forward to 
both the free fries and the beer 
selection.

Settlements on 
city’s East Side

By CAROLYN GEARIG

Daily Staff Reporter

On Valentine’s Day, 40 Uni-

versity students showed their 
love for the city of Detroit.

For the third and final event 

of Detroit Week, students spent 
Saturday painting walls and 
building a cardboard school 
bus at Franklin-Wright Settle-
ments, a human services orga-
nization in the city.

Detroit Week was a series of 

three Detroit-focused events 
organized by the Detroit Part-
nership, the Black Student 
Union, Semester in Detroit, 
LSA Student Government and 
the Black Volunteer Network. 

The other two events included 
a dinner called The Soup and a 
panel on race and food justice.

The events aimed to raise 

awareness of challenges fac-
ing Detroit, and promote action 
among the University commu-
nity.

LSA senior Arnold Reed, 

BSU speaker, and Public Policy 
junior Blair Sucher, educa-
tion director for the Detroit 
Partnership, began planning 
Detroit Week at the end of fall 

semester.

“We had the same vision,” 

Reed said. “When we came 
together, we were like, let’s do 
it. We said, ‘What if we could 
bring other organizations into 
the fold? There’s a lot of com-
munity service organizations 
on campus and a lot of orgs that 
would love to do this type of 
work.’ ”

Current and 

former employee 
make claims on 

three counts 

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOUS

Daily Staff Reporter

One former and one current 

University employee are suing 
the University and the Univer-
sity’s Board of Regents in fed-
eral court over three alleged civil 
rights violations.

The two plaintiffs are Lorie 

Biggs, who began work in Novem-
ber in 2010, and Jamie Mercurio, 
who joined in April 2012. Both 
worked as patient service associ-
ates. The two women claim they 
were sexually harassed by co-
workers, and Biggs also claims 
a documented disability was not 
properly accommodated.

The lawsuit was filed on Jan. 

13, 2015. It includes one count 
of sexual harassment under fed-

eral law, one count of failure to 
accommodate in violation of the 
American with Disabilities Act 
of 1990 and one count of violation 
of the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights 
Act, a state statute.

Sexual harassment
The lawsuit alleges that the two 

women were initially harassed by 
the same person, fellow employee 
Richard Page, who took photos of 
Biggs during work that she “con-
sidered to be inappropriate and 
of sexual nature,” asked Biggs for 
sex, and sent “sexually explicit” 
messages about Biggs and Mer-
curio through his work computer.

Page is listed as a patient reg-

istration and insurance specialist 
in the University’s directory.

Biggs complained to her then-

supervisor Jenny Wilson who, 
according to the lawsuit, told her 
“there had been previous sexual 
harassment complaints against 
Page, but nothing was going to be 
done about his behavior.”

After Wilson left the Univer-

sity in 2013, Biggs and Mercrio

sponsored by the Michigan Din-
ing and an assortment of food-
related organizations, including 
Whole Foods Market and The 
Farm at St. Joe’s.

The summit takes place in 

different locations every year 
so more people can collaborate 
and address local food issues; 
the organizers have previously 
worked with the University and 
Washtenaw Community College 
to engage with students and the 
local community.

This year, the University was 

chosen to host the event because 
of its history of working with 
local vendors, food entrepreneurs 
and artisans to prioritize sustain-
able strategies.

“Food Love” was the theme of 

this year’s Food Summit.

University alum Lucas DiGia, 

an emcee of the event and a 
member of the Local Food Sum-
mit’s planning committee, noted 
that while “Food Love” partially 
reflected the event’s proxim-
ity to Valentine’s Day, the theme 
was chosen to reflect the love and 
appreciation the event’s organiz-
ers have for all the members of 
the local food community.

The event included presen-

tations from numerous speak-
ers and breakout discussions in 
which attendees were asked to 
reflect on food sustainability top-

ics.

The sessions included “Just 

the Ten of Us,” which focused 
on local food security, and “Car-
ing about our Food Community,” 
in which University students 
discussed food waste on college 
campuses.

Loren Rullman, University’s 

associate vice president for stu-
dent life, welcomed attendees to 
the event in a brief speech. He 
mentioned that University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel has made 
sustainability a priority during 
his time so far in office.

Last fall, Schlissel announced 

plans to launch a review of the 
University’s sustainability goals. 
The University has failed to make 
significant progress on several of 
the goal’s initially set under for-
mer University President Mary 
Sue Coleman.

He 
said 
the 
University’s 

administration has strived to 
make food a part of this effort, 
and has increased University 
composting and encouraged more 
local sourcing.

Judy Wicks, the founder of 

White Dog Cafe in Philadel-
phia, was the Summit’s keynote 
speaker. Known for her commu-
nity engagement, environmental 
stewardship and responsible busi-
ness leadership, Wicks’ speech 
focused on building a more com-
passionate economy.

“Business is about relation-

ships with people and nature,” 
she said, adding that these rela-

tionships can be threatened by a 
profit- and competition-driven 
economic system.

The current model, she said, is 

built on the concept that nature 
is something to be exploited. She 
added that this notion runs con-
trary to her upbringing.

“We all belong to Earth,” she 

said. “Our current economic sys-
tem is destroying the life on it.”

Wicks touted the “localism 

movement,” which strives for the 
growth and use of local and more 
sustainable food resources.

“(It transforms) the economy 

from life-destroying to life-giv-
ing,” she said.

She explained that the rela-

tionships between small busi-
nesses and their communities are 
integral to the success of local 
economies. 
Subsequently, 
she 

decided to pay her staff a living 
wage as opposed to the minimum 
wage.

Additionally, 
she 
said 
the 

White Dog Cafe became the 
first business to use 100-percent 
renewable energy and adopted 
a “humane menu” in which all 
ingredients 
come 
from 
fam-

ily farms that prioritize humane 
treatment of animals.

She pointed to other responsi-

ble business models — like that of 
Zingerman’s Community of Busi-
nesses in Ann Arbor — which has 
expanded only locally as opposed 
to nationally, maintaining an 
authentic relationship with its 
community.

Wicks concluded with remarks 

that businesses can grow locally 
in non-material ways by expand-
ing their consciousness and nur-
turing relationships with their 
communities. She said this could 
contribute to the development of 
a global network of sustainable 
businesses.

Following Wicks’ address, sev-

eral attendees participated in a 
“story slam” led by writer, poet 
and activist William Copeland.

Individuals shared experienc-

es that had led them to connect 
with the localism movement and 
memories that cultivated their 
love for food.

“I do know that there are many 

ways we are similar, one of them 
being the fact that we all eat,” 
said Colleen Crawley, an Ann 
Arbor local and a participant in 
the story slam. “We are willing 
to work together and make our 
hands dirty.”

Several 
organizations 
were 

honored at the Food Summit, 
including the University’s Stu-
dent Food Co.

LSA senior Colleen Rathz, vice 

president of outreach for the Stu-
dent Food Co., attended the event 
to accept the award.

“A lot of people are talking 

about campus food, food security 
and healthy eating and nutrition, 
so I’m really excited to work on 
that,” she said. “I love that (we 
are) a presence on campus and 
are able to provide students with 
produce.”

This Week in History

SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (FEB. 23, 1998) 

Former English prof. arrested

Former English Prof. Gayl 

Jones was arrested and taken 
into custody in Lexington, 
Ky. She and her boyfriend, 
Bob Higgins, fled Ann Arbor 
in 1983 after Higgins evaded 
arrest for waving a gun at 
protesters during a gay rights 
rally.

After a standoff with police, 

Higgins slit his throat and 
later died at the University 
of Kentucky hospital. Jones 
attempted suicide as well, but 
was ultimately stopped and 
put into emergency detention.

The couple’s final encounter 

with authorities came 14 years 
after 
Higgins’ 
gun-waving 

incident.

Fourteen years ago this 
week (Feb. 19, 2001)

A 
record-setting 
crowd 

gathered on the Diag for the 
Kiss-In, an event in support of 
the LGBTQ community.

The rally was the final 

installment of what was known 
as “Queer Visibility Week.” 
Speakers from the local LGBTQ 
community encouraged others 
not to hide their identities, and 
the event ended with public 
displays of affection by those in 
attendance.

There was initially concern 

that the rally would not remain 
peaceful — anti-gay rights 
activist and Topeka, Kan., pas-

tor Fred Phelps had threatened 
to come. Phelps ultimately did 
not attend, but in a phone inter-
view said he would “be there 
next time.” About 15 protesters 
did show up to the event, but 
kept their distance and did not 
interfere.

Twenty-nine years ago this 

week (Feb. 19, 1986)

B’nai B’rith Hillel Founda-

tion, a nonprofit that serves the 
Jewish communities of college 
campuses and is now called Hil-
lel International, announced it 
would spearhead a $3 million 
renovation to its University 
facility.

CONNOR BADE/Daily

Nursing sophomore Ariel Jordan paints the hallway 
wall at the Franklin Wright Settlement in Detroit Sat-
urday.

vice organization on Detroit’s 
east side. Raymond Brown, a 
volunteer for the organization 
as well as the building operator, 
helped organize the art project 
students participated in on Sat-
urday.

Brown said he has been 

involved 
in 
Franklin-Wright 

Settlements since he was born, 
when 
he 
received 
his 
first 

immunizations and dental work 
through the organization.

“We do programs from the 

cradle to the grave,” he said. 
“Our oldest senior is 101 years 
old.”

Franklin-Wright Settlements 

began as a day nursery in 1881, 
and now provides an array of 
programs 
and 
resources 
to 

Detroiters. They include a senior 
outreach program, an after-
school program and an early 
childhood 
development 
pro-

gram, to name a few. Every year, 
40 to 50 high school students 
visit colleges across the country 
with Franklin-Wright. Ninety-
nine percent of these students 
go on to become college gradu-
ates and Brown said 75 percent 
are first-generation college stu-
dents.

Franklin-Wright also hosts 

events to help Detroiters with 
their daily needs. Last week, 
residents were invited to receive 

assistance signing up for DTE 
Energy’s Low Income Self-Suf-
ficiency Plan, a payment plan 
which helps low-income families 
pay for utilities.

“You don’t want to give people 

a handout,” Jay Yule, director of 
human resources and prepara-
tions at Franklin-Wright, said. 
“You want to give them a hand-
up.”

LSA senior Sidney Wiltshire 

is president of the Black Volun-
teer Network, an organization 
that provides opportunities for 
community service, as well as 
scholarships and college tours 
for high school students from 
low-income families. BVN runs 
weekly volunteer programs in 
Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, as well 

as monthly programs in Detroit.

“We provide opportunities 

for people in underdeveloped 
areas,” Wiltshire said. “We try 
to promote social justice through 
community service, giving back 
and trying to uplift members of 
our community.”

During Saturday’s event, stu-

dents painted a dance studio, a 
hallway and a bathroom. They 
also 
completed 
a 
cardboard 

school bus for an upcoming play.

Reed said he has high hopes 

for the future of Detroit Week.

“We’re definitely hoping it 

turns into an annual collabora-
tion,” he said. “The more people 
we can have involved, the bet-
ter.”

NEWBERRY, Mich.
Arctic deep freeze 
blankets Michigan

An Arctic cold front gripped 

Michigan on Sunday, sending 
temperatures plunging to minus 
27 in the Upper Peninsula and 
minus 22 in the northern Lower 
Peninsula and shattering at least 
five record lows for the date.

The deep freeze came with 

an easing of the snow and windy 
conditions that forced a number 
of Upper Peninsula roads to close 
Saturday. At 6 a.m., state police 
announced the reopening of U.S. 
2 between Manistique and Rapid 
River and Michigan 35 between 
Lathrop and Perkins.

“Both of the roadways closed 

yesterday and throughout the 
night due to inclement weather 
where snow and high winds 
were causing whiteout condi-
tions,” the state police Negaunee 
post said in a statement.

Instead, she denied being his 
wife.

After posing as Mueller’s hus-

band and persuading a string of 
people to let him plead for her 
release, Alkhani left the room 
empty-handed. He said he saw 
her face for just a few seconds 
when guards uncovered it.

The guards had assured Muel-

ler, 26, that Alkhani would not be 
harmed if she told the truth, so 
she apparently stuck to honesty 
to save him rather than take the 
slim chance to save herself, he 
said.

“Since she’s American, they 

would not let her go anyway. No 
sense to stay here, both of us,” 
Alkhani said. “Maybe she want-
ed to save me. Maybe she didn’t 
know I came back to save her.”

COPENHAGEN
Danish authorities 
say shooter had 
criminal record 

The slain gunman suspected 

in the deadly Copenhagen attacks 
was a 22-year-old with a history 
of violence and may have been 
inspired by Islamic terrorists — 
and possibly the Charlie Hebdo 
massacre in Paris, Danish authori-
ties said Sunday.

Prime Minister Helle Thorn-

ing-Schmidt mourned the two 
people killed and vowed to protect 
freedom of speech and Denmark’s 
Jewish community.

The suspect was killed in a gun-

battle with a SWAT team early 
Sunday. He had opened fire Sat-
urday at a cultural center hosting 
a seminar on free speech with an 
artist who had caricatured the 
Prophet Muhammad and then 
later at security forces outside a 
synagogue, police said.

directed their complaints to 
the new supervisor Donna 
Navarre, a call center coor-
dinator, in March and April 
2013. The lawsuit charges that 
Navarre did not do anything 
about the complaints.

“Biggs and Mercurio also 

complained to Navarre about a 
coworker who Biggs and Mer-
curio felt was leering at them,” 
the lawsuit reads. “Navarre 
responded by telling Biggs and 
Mercurio to drop a pen and pick 
it up in front of the co worker to 
‘give him a show.’ “

Violation of the 
Americans with 

Disabilities Act of 1990
The lawsuit notes that Biggs 

has a disability that is eli-
gible for coverage within the 
definition of the ADA. Biggs 
claims that in September of 
2013 she requested a different 
chair because of a back-related 
problem and despite filing the 
appropriate paperwork, did not 
receive it.

Violation of Elliott-Larsen 

Civil Rights Act

In January 2014, Biggs was 

terminated for performance 

issues and Mercurio was placed 
on temporary unpaid leave. 
The lawsuit notes that neither 
of the two women had been 
criticized or disciplined prior 
throughout their employment.

“Biggs was fired because 

she complained about sexu-
al harassment,” the lawsuit 
reads. “Mercurio was placed 
on unpaid leave of absence 
because she complained about 
sexual harassment.”

The lawsuit also charges that 

after Biggs was fired, Navarre 
mailed her a box of rocks, as 
well as created a hostile work 
environment 
for 
Mercurio 

when she returned to her posi-
tion.

The plaintiffs, represented 

by Gold Star Law P.C., are cur-
rently awaiting the University’s 
response.

Normally, a defendant has 

21 days to respond to this type 
of lawsuit. However, Caitlin 
Malhiot, one of the attorneys 
representing the two plaintiffs, 
said in an interview Friday 
they have granted a request 
from the University for a two-
week extension to provide a 
response to the allegations. 
Once the response is received, 
court dates will be set.

Malhiot said resolving the 

issues 
through 
a 
mutually 

agreeable settlement without 
going to court is always prefer-
able, though she added that it’s 
unclear whether such a settle-
ment exists because the Uni-
versity has not yet replied to 
the complaint.

“This is a very upsetting 

issue for my clients,” Malhiot 
said. “They just want the issue 
to be done, but at the same 
time what happened to them is 
wrong and they do want it to be 
addressed, they do want justice 
for that. They do want the com-
pensation that they are owed.”

Malhiot 
said 
monetary 

compensation at some level 
is always a significant option. 
Additionally, she noted that 
Biggs would be willing to con-
sider reinstatement at the Uni-
versity, in a position away from 
the alleged harassers.

Navarre, Page and Wilson 

declined requests for com-
ment via e-mail, referring The 
Michigan Daily to the UMHS 
Department of Communica-
tions.

In response to a request for 

comment Friday, Mary Mas-
son, a media relations repre-
sentative for UMHS, said she 
couldn’t provide any informa-
tion on a pending litigation.

Divest and Invest’s goal resonat-
ed with many students.

“This is our future we’re 

fighting for and divestment is 
definitely one tactic through 
which students can make an 
impact,” Jansen said.

Volunteers and Divest and 

Invest members set up a table 
and encouraged passersby to 
sign an online petition as well 
as a large banner in support of 
divestment that lay on the Diag.

“Invest in your future, divest 

today,” one volunteer handing 
out flyers called to a group of 
students.

Supporters later wore their 

orange 
shirts 
and 
gathered 

around the signed banner at 
the center of the Diag. Jansen 
engaged the crowd in a series of 
call and response chants.

“Invest!” Jansen called to 

group. “Tomorrow!” the group 
yelled back in unison.

“Divest!” 
Jason 
screamed. 

“Today!” the group responded.

The protest was part of “Glob-

al Divestment Day,” an interna-
tional series of events planned 
for this past weekend to call for 
governments, universities and 
other organizations to divest 
from companies that produce 
fossil fuels.

More than 400 events were 

planned in several dozen coun-

tries on six different continents, 
according to 350.org, which 
organized the protests. 350.
org is an international environ-
mental organization that aims 
to mobilize grassroots action 
and pressure leaders around the 
world to address climate change.

Schools with groups par-

ticipating in Global Divestment 
Day included Harvard Uni-
versity, Columbia University, 
Syracuse University and Univer-
sity College London. The United 
Nations has also endorsed the 
international event.

Nineteen 
colleges 
in 
the 

United States have pledged to 
divest from fossil fuels, though 
most have only done so in mod-
est amounts. Stanford Univer-
sity is the largest and wealthiest 
school to have pledged to divest. 
Last May, Stanford administra-
tors promised in a statement 
that they would not make finan-
cial investments in coal mining 
companies.

About $1.04 billion of the 

University’s $9.16 billion endow-
ment was categorized as fossil 
fuel investments as of 2012. The 
Divest and Invest campaign has 
asked the University’s Board of 
Regents several timesto divest.

In a November 2014 inter-

view with The Michigan Daily, 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
purposely sets stringent stan-
dards for divestment.

“The bar is set intentionally 

high ... to somewhat insulate the 
investment office from the polit-
ical winds that could change 
from one direction to the other,” 
Fitzgerald said.

The regents have only voted 

to divest twice — from South 
Africa in 1978 during apartheid 
and, more recently, from tobac-
co-related companies in 2000.

While Jansen conceded that 

the University has been “pretty 
unresponsive” to Divest and 

Invest’s calls to action, he cited 
the success of those two divest-
ment movements as inspiration 
for the organization.

“We’ve been working a lot 

with the administration and 
they have specified certain cri-
teria that we have to meet for 
them to take action,” Jansen 
said. “The main criterion they 
said we have to meet is to show 
that it’s an issue students care 
about.”

Jansen also emphasized the 

urgency and global nature of 
the problem of climate change 
as key drivers behind Global 
Divestment Day.

“With climate change, we’re 

running out of time — it’s a prob-
lem we have to address now,” 
Jansen said. “Because it’s such 
a global issue, the perfect way to 
portray that is to have a global 
day to support the cause.”

Kentucky Breakfast Stout,” Lee 
said. “They’re only on tap in a 
given city maybe three times a 
year.”

In 
an 
interview 
Saturday 

morning, HopCat founder and 
owner Mark Sellers said the beer 
list was given special consider-
ation for the grand opening.

“We challenged our ‘beer 

guy’ … to come up with the best 
100-tap list any bar’s ever had,” 
he said. “It’s arguable whether 
we’ve done that, but we’ve got an 
amazing list.”

Sellers said most HopCat loca-

tions are typically near universi-
ties, so they’re used to a customer 
base of faculty and students, but 
thus far the clientele here has 
had slightly different tastes.

“The thing I’ve noticed just 

in the couple of days that we’ve 
had some customers come in is 
that they seem to be very knowl-
edgeable about beer, right from 
the start,” he said. “That’s not 
always the case. Some of the 
places we’ve opened we’ve had to 

teach the customers a lot about 
the beer.”

HopCat 
waitress 
Meg 

Schemanske, a University alum, 
said she had been interested in 
beer before working at HopCat, 
but the training process gave her 
a new perspective.

“It’s definitely a culture,” she 

said. “That’s one thing that I 
think I learned the most.”

She said the company put on 

a week of “beer school” for the 
staff, in addition to two weeks of 
general service training.

“We spent an entire week in 

class learning different beer 
styles, different aromas, differ-
ent hops, different yeasts,” she 
said. “As much as you can learn 
about beer, we learned it.”

Seller said he thought several 

factors would distinguish Hop-
Cat from the other bars down-
town.

“We have a very laid-back 

family environment with our 
employees, so it’s like a big fam-
ily that works here,” he said. “We 
have 100 beers on tap, all craft 
beer, and we have a pretty cool 
interior design, with a lot of inte-
rior artwork.”

W

hat my friend and fellow film writ-
er Conrad Foreman, LSA junior, 
wrote about “Son of God” applies 

to “American Sniper”: “Jesus 
is back. And he’s white. 
Again.” But John Wayne is 
also back. And he’s killing 
savages. Again. In short, 
Chris Kyle, the all-American 
hero of “Sniper,” gives god-
fearing Christian Americans 
the orgasm they’ve been 
waiting for: Jesus, mixed 
with John Wayne, carrying 
a gun, killing A-rabs.

All this controversy over 

whether “American Sniper” 
is U.S. propaganda will be resolved when we 
recognize the film for what it is — just another 
Hollywood Western.

The classic Westerns, as anyone who’s seen 

them knows, weren’t too friendly to the Native 
Americans. See, when the European Ameri-
cans had finally settled the American West 
(that is, settled on top of the Native Americans’ 
already-existing settlement), the European 
Americans, who had thus far been nothing but 
settlers, didn’t know what to do or who to be 
anymore. So when the caravans reached the 
Pacific Ocean, and it seemed that there was no 
further west for the Manifest Destiny to take 
them, the ex-settlers decided to make movies 
so they could remember what they used to do 
and who they used to be.

But when these early filmmakers remem-

bered what settling was like (that is, when 
they looked at the historical record), they 
realized that, at best, the true story wouldn’t 
sell movie tickets and, at worst, would get 
them accused of treason. So instead they 
produced movies that made the genocide the 
European Americans committed against the 

Native Americans appear justified.

By the time Clint Eastwood put on his pon-

cho and cowboy boots, it was no longer “cool,” 
as the kids say, to portray Native Americans as 
demonic savages. It was still all right to por-
tray the cowboy as a fair-haired, fair-skinned 
pseudo-Christ on a crusade against something 
… just not against the so-called savages. So 
Eastwood went to Italy and filmed some new 
Westerns and people called them spaghetti 
 

(that is, “spaghetti Westerns”).

Now, with the coming of Chris Kyle and 

“American Sniper,” Eastwood has invented a 
new kind of Western — the hummus Western. 
(One of Kyle’s comrades literally says that 
Fallujah, Iraq, the site of Kyle’s first tour of 
duty, is “the Wild West of the Middle East.”) 
All the taboo, classic Western stuff East-
wood couldn’t do in his spaghetti Westerns, 
he’s finally done in the hummus Western. In 
“American Sniper,” the Iraqis have replaced 
the Indians. Unlike the all-American cowboy 
Chris Kyle and his comrades, the Iraqis have 
no backstories. We can watch Kyle slay doz-
ens of them because the film renders them 
as non-persons. Spoiler alert: But when it 
comes to Kyle, who the film portrays to us as 
a fleshed-out human being with a wife, family 
kids, etc., seeing his death would be just too 
brutal, so it’s censored.

Eastwood’s overall project appears to be 

the same as the project of the classic Western 
filmmakers: rewrite history so that the white 
people look justified killing brown people. But 
there’s an important difference: America is no 
longer interested in settling like they were in 
the American West. The ideological useful-
ness of the concept of “Manifest Destiny” has 
expired: She no longer aspires to gain new ter-
ritory. The result is far more cruel and vicious. 
The savages today aren’t savages because they 
impede upon the United States’ divine right to 

The hummus Western

V

oting has been delayed on a set of bills in the Michigan 
State Senate that would alter the existing legislation for 
criminal penalties in cases of animal cruelty and neglect. 

The bills would create three different degrees of killing or torturing 
an animal, which would increase the maximum prison terms for 
first- and second-degree offenses. The legislation would also make 
it easier to prosecute breeders and pet-shop operators who are 
repeat offenders, and to monitor cases of animal neglect and cruelty 
that include large numbers of animals. These amendments are 
nuanced and work to protect animals and create safer communities 
in general, and as such should be passed and enacted as soon 
 

as possible.

Currently, under the Michigan Penal Code, 

all cases of animal killing and torture are 
classified under the same offense and are 
subject to a four-year felony charge. These 
bills would create first, second and third 
degrees of animal killing and torturing. 
Also, those accused of killing or torturing an 
animal, or threatening to do so to exert control 
over a person, would be subject to a 10-year 
felony charge. The amendments would create 
a penalty for breeders and pet shops that 
have incurred five or more prior convictions 
and introduce a mandatory minimum of five 
years of probation for cases of animal neglect 
or cruelty that involve 25 or more animals, 
among other things.

Researchers have found that threatened or 

perpetrated animal abuse or killing is common 
in abusive relationships, with around 71 percent 
of women with pet-ownership histories 
entering domestic violence shelters reporting 
that their abusive partner had threatened or 
committed violence against their pet. These 
amendments would address this problem 
and protect victims of abusive relationships 
by imposing harsher punishments for this 
emotional abuse and manipulation. Moreover, 
studies have indicated a link between animal 
cruelty and other forms of violence. Therefore, 
taking animal abuse more seriously could, 
through rehabilitation, help prevent other 
violent crimes.

These bills would also help create safer 

communities by imposing a minimum five-
year probation for large-scale animal neglect. 
This change, at the discretion of the judge, 
would enable animal hoarders to be put on 
mental health watch and potentially allow 

for mental health treatment. This solution 
would be effective, considering animal neglect 
as the result of animal hoarding is often 
unintentional, and is indicative of a problem 
that will not go away without treatment. 
Codified 
understanding 
of 
the 
mental 

components at play in situations of animal 
neglect, however, should be extended to other 
areas of the law.

Lastly, these bills work to protect valued, 

yet vulnerable members of society — pets. 
Violence toward these animals can be viewed 
as damaging to families and communities. The 
tiered system of punishment for killing and 
torturing these animals is logical, as it reflects 
how penal codes deal with other instances of 
violent crime. Blanket treatment of violent 
crimes, and therefore of animal abuse, fails 
to consider the range and complexity of these 
crimes, creating disparities in the severity 
of its punishment. Furthermore, a four-year 
felony charge is simply not enough to deal 
with the crime of animal torture and killing, 
especially considering that this charge doesn’t 
always result in prison time. Since many non-
violent crimes, such as drug use, result in 
more jail time, it is fitting that these violent 
crimes should be taken more seriously. These 
amendments would help to create a criminal 
justice system that results in punishment 
more fitting to the crime committed.

The existing legislation regarding animal 

cruelty needs change, and these bills offer 
balanced amendments that consider the 
complexities of animal abuse and neglect. 
If Michigan wants to treat animal cruelty 
seriously, the passage of these bills should be 
a priority.

L

ast Wednesday, your net-
work covered the Univer-
sity’s Inclusive Language 

Campaign, 
a 

$16,000 effort to 
educate students 
on 
the 
impact 

behind 
common 

phrases like “I 
want to die” and 
“That’s so gay.”

Amanda McLit-

tle, coordinator of 
Diversity 
Educa-

tion in University 
Housing, told the 
Daily in Septem-
ber that the program was an attempt 
to improve campus climate, after 
events last school year like Theta 
Xi’s “Hood Rachet Party” evidenced 
a serious need to do so. The program 
went into effect at the start of the Fall 
2014 term.

Your coverage of the program 

was fantastic, managing to stir up 
controversy over an innocuous Uni-
versity program five months after it 
launched. Your video caption, “Uni-
versity is dictating what students can 
say,” met every standard for a click-
worthy phrase — incite all of the 
drama, include none of the facts.

A public university “dictating” the 

speech of its students?! Now there’s 
a story that’ll rile up those First 
Amendment defenders.

And that’s how your business 

model works. You fill a niche in 
the market. As of January 2014, 
38 percent of Americans self-iden-
tify as conservatives. Yet accord-
ing to a 2002 study, 20 percent of 
journalists said that they leaned 
“a little to the right,” and just five 
percent “leaned pretty far to the 
right.” I wonder how many in that 
 

five percent work for you.

Your ideology-driven model is 

working. Forty-seven percent of 
conservatives list you as their main 
news source on all things political. 

Your median primetime viewership 
in 2013 was higher than those of both 
CNN and MSNBC combined, and 
was the only major cable network 
to see viewership grow between the 
first quarters of 2013 and 2014.

I’m writing to you because you’ve 

covered quite a few stories about 
my University recently, most of 
which centered on issues of speech 
freedoms. I can’t say they were 
 

terribly accurate.

Your recent coverage of the Uni-

versity’s Inclusive 
Language 
Cam-

paign was shared 
on social media 
by students who 
were outraged by 
the 
University’s 

attempt to “stifle” 
their freedom of 
speech, as one 
student 
posted 

online.

And really, who cares that the 

initiative was based on student feed-
back and aimed at creating a more 
harmonious campus community? 
Painting the program as an absurd, 
double-think government plot to 
indoctrinate American students into 
not being able-ist or homophobic 
assholes free to speak their mind is 
a much better way to ensure high 
 

web traffic.

All you had to do was splash 

“Trouble with Schools” across the 
screen in punchy graphics, and find 
a student eager to give an interview 
full of nice, quotable sound bites 
that corroborated your viewpoint. 
The end result was a well-packaged, 
social-media-friendly story likely to 
be shared by those already holding 
the views it promoted.

In a digital era where publications 

compete for continually diminishing 
advertising dollars, the most success-
ful stories are those that generate 
the most attention, and consequent-
ly, page views. And so for that, Fox 

News, you deserve a gold star, a 
medal of distinction for your contri-
butions to the industry.

And, if I were a liberal, I would 

also owe you a big thank you. The 
right gets more of their political 
news from you than from any other 
news source. There are several issues 
today that would strongly benefit 
from cohesive conservative policies 
and leadership. But because it is con-
suming the stories that your analysts 
and writers deem likely to help you 

retain your vast 
market 
power, 

the 
party 
is 

instead focused 
on meaningless, 
non-actionable 
items like fake 
free 
speech 

violations at a 
Midwestern 
university.

Eventually, 

your poor fact-checking and fail-
ure to adhere to journalism’s ethi-
cal standards might come back 
to haunt you. Maybe some other 
Republicans will start to realize 
that your manipulative tactics do 
more harm than good for our party. 
Maybe your faulty reporting will 
produce a story so big and inac-
curate that it will create a scandal 
similar to the one experienced by 
Rolling Stone earlier this year. But 
hey, in the meantime, your antics 
are sure to drive profits, and that’s 
all you seem to care about anyway.

And so I commend you, Fox 

News, for your relentless effort to 
push journalism into an age of click-
worthy content devoid of facts, and 
your unapologetic pursuit of profit at 
the expense of the party you appear 
to support. But, next time, would 
you mind doing it at the expense of 
someone else’s school?

Love for all, hatred for 

none TO THE DAILY: 

I’ve always felt safe in America. 

Granted, growing up as a Mus-
lim American in the post-9/11 
era poses its challenges, but I’ve 
always maintained the “it won’t be 
me” mentality. That is, until Tues-
day evening. The news reported 
that three innocent Muslim stu-
dents were brutally murdered in 

their home near Chapel Hill, N.C.

Muslim students. Just like me.
Their assailant was a vocal anti-

theist whose heinous act adds to 
the growing list of Islamopho-
bic sentiments, protests and hate 
crimes in America.

Let’s not forget that Duke Uni-

versity rescinded its initial deci-
sion to allow the Muslim call to 
prayer after threat of financial boy-
cott from the likes of Franklin Gra-
ham, or that anti-Muslim threats 

tripled following the release of the 
movie “American Sniper.”

The only combatant to this big-

otry is tolerance. I call upon my 
fellow Americans to stand togeth-
er as one, regardless of race and 
religion, and share in acceptance. 
In a phrase, I proclaim my Muslim 
community’s motto of “Love for 
All, Hatred for None.”

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Dear Fox News

Manifest Destiny: they are savages 
simply for existing. Andrea Smith 
got it right in her essay, “Indige-
neity, Settler Colonialism, White 
Supremacy:” America has marked 
Arabs as inferior and deemed them 
to be constant threats to the well-
being of the American empire. So 
unlike the classic Western, the 
hummus Western attempts to jus-
tify killing of savages and occupa-
tion of their land on the grounds 
that the mere fact of their existence 
constitutes a threat.

Nonetheless, some people might 

ask, “Was Chris Kyle, the one who 
lived and breathed, a real American 
cowboy?” That’s like asking, “Is a 
Disneyland castle a real castle?” 
A Disneyland castle is physical, 
material manifestation of a fan-
tasy castle. No castle ever really — 
materially speaking — existed that 

looked like Cinderella’s. Likewise, 
Chris Kyle, the one who lived and 
breathed, was a physical, material 
manifestation of a fantasy person 
— the American Cowboy. No cow-
boy ever really existed materially 
that looked like the Ringo Kid. So 
what does that make the movie-
version Chris Kyle? The imitation 
of a person who was the imitation 
of a fictional character. This cycle 
of representation entirely excludes 
any reality principle.

But still, was Chris Kyle a real 

American hero? The question is 
nonsensical. Hollywood invented 
the concept of an “American hero” 
(which I interpret as more or less 
synonymous with “American cow-
boy”) to help sell movie tickets. 
That is to say, an “American hero” 
exists only in the world of cinemat-
ic fiction. There can be no “real” 

American heroes because an Amer-
ican hero, by definition, can only 
be fictional. But there are certain-
ly character archetypes, like the 
American cowboy, who inspire peo-
ple who live and breath. To borrow 
Jean Baudrillard’s phrasing, when 
“the map engenders the territory,” 
it creates something hyper-real — 
something materially existing but 
based on a fiction (e.g., a Disney-
land castle or the living, breathing 
Chris Kyle). Thus, ironically, the 
fictional Chris Kyle played by Brad-
ley Cooper is far more an American 
hero than was the living, breathing 
Chris Kyle.

So, with all this in mind, I ask 

sincerely: Who would want to be an 
American hero anyway?

“What’d you say about Star Trek?!?!”

Don’t read this, go 
listen to Drake

ALBUM REVIEW

The Toronto rapper’s 

mixtape/album 

makes a statement

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

Late Thursday night, Drake 

tweeted a link to If You’re Reading 
This It’s Too Late after teasing it 
with the release of 
a short film titled 
“Jungle” 
earlier 

in the day. He’s 
calling it a mix-
tape, but within 
an hour it was 
off the Internet, 
and only available 
to 
purchase 
on 

iTunes. Mixtapes 
don’t cost money; 
they’re 
usually 

found in the crev-
ices of the Internet. And they defi-
nitely don’t span over 70 minutes 
like this one does. Of course, I still 
found myself spending $12.99 for it 
while at a party before leaving so 
I could have my own personal lis-
tening session.

But the 17-track project, which 

features collaborations with Lil 
Wayne, PARTYNEXTDOOR and 
Travi$ Scott, works because he’s 
calling it a mixtape, rather than a 
full-blown album. It doesn’t feel 
like the follow up to 2013’s Noth-
ing Was The Same because it’s not 
supposed to. There was almost no 
promotional work, unlike NWTS 
and his 2011 effort Take Care, 
where we’d essentially heard the 
whole album before the release. 
None of the tracks on IYRTITL 
could have been obvious singles. 
And their content sounds differ-
ent: more urgent, aggressive and 
cold. It’s the Toronto rapper’s way 
of telling people, if they didn’t 
already know, he’s not one to be 
fucked with. He’s only getting big-
ger, and he knows it. That could 
be what Drake’s referencing with 
the project’s title; If You’re Reading 
This It’s Too Late serves as a state-
ment to fellow rappers and fans 
alike, implying we can’t keep up 
and that’s how he likes it.

In fact, the whole tape feels like 

a statement. It can’t be a coinci-
dence that Drake decided to drop 
the thing the same day Kanye 
West unveiled his new fashion line 

with Adidas, as well as a surprise 
track, during New York Fashion 
Week. And the tracks are littered 
with shots at other rappers, even 
friends like Jay Z and West. He 
explicitly calls out Tyga during 
“6PM in New York” – “I heard a lil’ 
lil’ homie talking reckless in VIBE 
/ Quite a platform you chose, you 
shoulda kept it inside/ Oh you tried 
it, it’s so childish calling my name 
on the world stage/ You need to act 
your age and not your girl’s age” – 
and finally breaks his silence about 
the beef with Cash Money Records 
in “Star67” – “Walk up in my label 
like, where the check though?/ 
Yeah I said it, wouldn’t dap you 
with the left ho.” This brings up 
an interesting question: Does this 
“mixtape” fulfill Drake’s four-
album contract with Cash Money? 
That would explain why it was 
up on iTunes for sale, as opposed 
to the usual Internet upload that 
mixtapes 
recieve. 
With 
both 

Drake and Wayne on the outs, this 
could be the death of the famous 
hip-hop label.

If this tape was a goodbye, it’s 

a hell of a good one. We get the 
Drake that goes off in bangers like 
“Know Yourself” and “6 God,” but 
also the introspective, moody-
broody Drake – my favorite Drake 
– in songs like “Now and Forever” 
and “Jungle.” We get a bunch of 
millennial references no one will 
understand in 10 years but that still 
really resonate right now – “Call 
your ass an Uber, I got somewhere 
to be.” We get Drake talking about 
his mom because he can’t not talk 
about his mom. “I can’t be out here 
being vulnerable, momma” is the 
most Drake lyric I’ve ever heard. 

We get an abnormally long mix-
tape that feels short, which makes 
it easy to listen to on repeat.

But we also get a mixtape that 

might be trying a little too hard 
to be hard. Drake has always been 
acutely conscious of his position in 
the rap world. But all these shots 
at other rappers? Or the gunshot 
features on “Energy” and “Know 
Yourself?” Like, come on Drake, 
we know you’ve never shot a gun 
in your life. Or on “Energy,” he 
raps over and over again about 
how he’s got enemies, like a lot of 
enemies. We get it, Drake, people 
don’t like you! It feels inauthentic 
at points. Drake wants so terribly 
to prove himself, and he says just 
that in “6PM in New York” – “I 
wanna prove that I’m number one 
over all these niggas.”

Still, something has changed 

with the rapper. He even notes in 
“6PM,” “‘Best I Ever Had’ seems 
like a decade ago.” IYRTITL marks 
a transition for Drake’s sound, 
attitude and, potentially, even his 
label. He’s completely confident 
doing whatever he wants now, 
like dropping a whole mixtape 
unannounced. He knew we were 
all thirsty during this dry period 
before the release of his actual 
anticipated album Views From the 
Six, so he gave us a taste of what’s 
to come later this year.

And I don’t regret leaving that 

party to listen.

Minkoff show 
a ’70s homage

By KATIE CAMPBELL

Daily Arts Writer

Rebecca Minkoff’s New York 

Fashion Week designs were an 
homage to the ’70s. The runway 
was filled with loosely styled cool 
girls wearing fringe, tall boots and 
deep, muted colors. The opening 
look was the perfect way to define 
the show — a brown and black com-
bination of a peasant blouse and mini 
skirt topped with a vest. Other nota-
ble outfits included a look defined 
by a vibrant red peasant dress with 
a knee length leather jacket and an 
ankle length, fringe skirt paired 
with a cream blouse and a leather/
fringe vest. The textures and fabrics 
of the pieces were a highlight of the 
collection. The fringe varied from 
white to black to brown, short to 
long, and are featured on the coats, 
dresses, skirts and boots. Other fab-
rics, such as leather, suede and wool, 

were paired with the fringe to bal-
ance out the intensity of the texture.

Minkoff’s looks define the con-

temporary approach to the trend-
ing Woodstock-esque styles that 
have been appearing on young 
adults since Coachella made music 
festivals fashionable. Minkoff’s 
approach to the relaxed style is 
countered by her tendency for 
structured pieces. In this collec-
tion, the most distinctive pieces 
were the outwear; the jackets, 
vests and coats layered over the 
models stealing the show. The 
pieces ranged from leather motor-
cycle 
jackets 
to 
ankle-length 

Sherpa 
coats. 
The 
collection 

offers many options for season 
transitions, as most of the pieces 
are layered. Any combination of 
the dresses, skirts, tops and bot-
toms can be mixed and matched, 
adding to the overall easy vibe of 
Minkoff’s inspiration, Patti Smith.

Despite strong cast, 
‘Slap’ can’t connect

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

The idea of a “guilty plea-

sure” show has been embraced 
wholeheartedly by broadcast 
networks. 
This 

type 
of 
series 

thrives on the 
idea of driving 
people to watch 
each week, even 
if 
they’re 
not 

the best shows 
on 
television. 

However, there’s 
something 
about each pro-
gram 
that 
fits 

that model that 
makes 
it 
worth 
watching. 

“Scandal” has dense plotting 
and cliffhangers that push 
you into the next week. Oth-
ers have performers that make 
them worth watching on their 
own, like Viola Davis on “How 
to Get Away with Murder” and 
Taraji P. Henson on “Empire.” 
“The Slap” has the right title, 
hook and cast to fit right in 
with these shows, but it never 
embraces what it could be and 
is painful as a result.

“The Slap,” based on an Aus-

tralian series of the same name, 
follows what happens after the 
events of Hector’s (Peter Sars-
gaard, “An Education”) 40th 
birthday party. At the party, 

Hector’s cousin Harry (Zach-
ary Quinto, “Star Trek”) slaps 
another couple’s misbehaving 
child, and the couple leaves 
the party threatening to press 
charges. The pilot also deals 
with 
Hector’s 
uncertainty 

about his affair with his under-
age babysitter Connie (Maken-
zie Leigh, “Gotham”).

What comes back to hit the 

show is the mix of over-the-
top storytelling elements and a 
sense that it wants to be taken 
seriously. From Hector’s intro-
duction 
as 
a 
jazz-listening 

“good guy gone bad” to the fam-
ily’s arguments, it only goes for 
one thing: drama. Every scene 
plays out with the emotional 
volume pushed up to 10. Even 
when it gets to the slap of the 
title, the child’s scream is heard 
in slow motion and the camera 
cuts to everyone’s *shocked* 
faces. This all could work if it 
didn’t try to take itself so seri-
ously. It’s so interested in doing 
a dramatic telling of its story 
that it loses track of how silly 
it all is. If it embraced that fac-
tor, then it could actually be a 
decent show, but it fails to rec-
ognize its potential.

It doesn’t help that the fan-

tastic cast is saddled with one-
note, stereotypical characters 
that don’t allow them to show 
any range as performers. The 
show has an excellent ensem-

ble, including Sarsgaard, Quin-
to, Uma Thurman (“Kill Bill”), 
Melissa George (“The Good 
Wife”) and Thomas Sadoski 
(“The Newsroom”). That cast 
should be able to make any-
thing better, but they’re stuck 
with the limited characters on 
the page. For example, Quinto’s 
character is the “hot-headed,” 
successful member of the fam-
ily, so he’s only told to play 
angry. He doesn’t get to add any 
nuance to his portrayal in the 
several minutes he’s on screen. 
Sarsgaard is the one given the 
most to work with in the first 
episode, but his character fits 
right into the “good leading 
man who has skeletons in his 
closet” stereotype. The show 
does nothing to break the char-
acter out of that mold and his 
performance suffers as a result. 
Honestly, if I were any one of 
these actors, I would be slap-
ping my agent for getting me 
involved in this schlock.

It’s really a shame. A show 

called “The Slap” with this 
premise should be something 
that fits right in as a television 
soap. Instead, its one-note char-
acters and heavy-handed story-
telling leave nothing to hook 
the viewer. Maybe it’ll get bet-
ter and the characters will gain 
depth as the show completes its 
eight episode run, but the first 
episode didn’t leave a mark.

Storytelling is still 
valuable for all ages

By BAILEY KADIAN

For the Daily

When I was little, I insisted 

that my dad tell me stories before 
I went to bed. I didn’t have any 
guidelines — I just wanted a 
story. They ranged from child-
hood memories at our cottage to 
days at school to anything else 
that came to his mind while sit-
ting at the edge of my bed.

Bedtime stories serve as a way 

for children to feed their grow-
ing imagination with pieces of 
narration. Children have youth-
ful spirits that long for adventur-
ous and exciting stories. And I 
don’t think I am all that different 
now. My imagination still yearns 
for some sort of adventure and 
I, along with presumably many 
others, turn to storytelling as a 
means of satisfying that desire. 
My eagerness to expand my 
imagination through storytell-
ing is just as prevalent now as 
it was 10 years ago. My dad’s 
description of “a warm and 
sunny day at the cottage” or “a 
cool, but beautiful football Sat-
urday” sparked the growth of 
my imagination. Storytelling, 
whether 
through 
literature, 

film, music or my dad’s sponta-
neous narratives, exists as a way 
for us to learn more about our-
selves through an exchange of 
reality for fictional exploration.

Now, I’m the nightly sto-

ryteller for my younger sister 
Tess. As I have grown to real-
ize the importance of this ritual 
through my own childhood, it 
comes as no surprise that my sis-
ter is just like me. She wants to 
listen to stories, too. There is an 
art within storytelling in which 
every person longs to engage. 
My sister and I aren’t the first 
children to insist on bedtime 
stories, and we certainly won’t 

be the last.

Storytelling 
will 
always 

remain a dominant part of our 
culture, but we must realize 
that there is a crucial compo-
nent to this practice that can-
not subside: the need to feed our 
imagination through our own 
creativity.

In this rapidly developing 

world, 
technology 
is 
every-

where, and children most often 
hear stories through digital 
media such as TV, games and 
whatever is immediately avail-
able electronically. As a result, 
young children are not devel-
oping their visual imagery, but 
relying on the images already 
handed to them. The exchange 
of storytelling from person to 
person is valuable, and though 
our culture is moving past the 
simplicity of it, I’m not sure 
that’s much of a benefit to our 
society.

We know the entertainment 

industry is vast and will continue 
to grow because people want to 
consume entertainment that is 
relatable. Psychological research 
has even proven that storytell-

ing involves the process of our 
brain projecting ourselves within 
the story being told, creating an 
attachment and interaction with 
the work. As such, we can better 
understand ourselves. And, I’m 
not sure I’ll ever figure myself out, 
so I’ll take all the help I can get.

The value of my father’s bed-

time stories comes from the free-
dom I had to imagine. The way 
his stories were recited to me was 
real, the way they were recalled 
was real and through their hon-
esty, I was able to connect with 
them. 
Our 
imaginations 
are 

fueled by creativity and it is cru-
cial we nurture these elements. In 
an age where we want to make an 
impact on the world and develop 
our minds to achieve amazing 
things, the core of that pursuit is 
found in the vastness and depth of 
our imaginations.

So am I too old to listen to 

bedtime 
stories? 
Yeah, 
that 

would probably be childish. 
But do I still want to grow and 
develop my imagination through 
a story, just as I did when I was a 
child? Yes, I do, and I encourage 
you all to do the same.

‘50 Shades’ won’t 
please audiences

The BDSM-lite film 
almost lives up to 

its potential 

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

By 2014, E L James’s erotic 

fantasy “Fifty Shades of Grey” 
had sold over 100 million copies, 
been 
translated 

into more than 
50 languages and 
unseated 
J.K. 

Rowling’s “Harry 
Potter” series as 
the 
fastest-sell-

ing novel of all 
time. Some critics 
reviled the book 
for its inaccurate 
portrayal of the 
BDSM 
commu-

nity and glorifica-
tion of an “abusive” relationship, 
but U.S. sales continued to sky-
rocket. With a novel this virile 
and phenomenal, the obvious 
next step was to adapt it into a 
movie so the series could rake 
in even more cash — and, more 
importantly, give millions of fans 
the opportunity to see all the 
bondage-suffused, manipulative 
romance played out on a screen, 
not in their imagination.

As I have never read James’s 

novel, I wasn’t entirely sure 
what to expect when I saw “Fifty 
Shades.” But upon leaving the 
theater, I was struck by how seri-
ously the film took itself. “Fifty 
Shades of Grey” rejects its trashy 
pedigree, using an R rating and 
the stylistic specificity of film to 
transform the scruffy plot and 
find its inner goddess. Director 
Sam Taylor-Johnson (“Nowhere 
Boy”) swathes the film in desatu-
rated tones and gorgeous close-
ups and sets the action to the 
pulsing musical beats of Beyoncé 
and The Rolling Stones. The film 
uses every tool in its cinemato-
graphic playroom to let viewers 
know that this isn’t the same fan-
tasy they read on their flight to 
Newark. It’s a slow, sleek and sexy 
film, markedly subtle even when 
it doesn’t have to be.

The film’s two-hour runtime 

unfolds in languid confidence. 
At times, the deliberate pacing 
borders on sluggish, but often-
times this carefulness works in 
the plot’s favor. After Anastasia 
Steele (Dakota Johnson, “Ben 
and Kate”) attempts her fate-

ful interview with millionaire 
entrepreneur 
Christian 
Grey 

(Jamie Dornan, “The Fall”), the 
pair take almost 40 minutes to 
climb into bed. But their ensuing 
foreplay is delightfully fun, and 
these awkward encounters serve 
as a means of demonstrating who 
they are as characters. Christian 
meets Ana in the hardware store 
where she works and asks her to 
show him where he can buy the 
cable ties, ropes and tape he needs 
for his handyman collection. It’s 
a cheeky way to introduce that 
Christian is into all things kinky, 
and Ana can’t look into his dreamy 
gray eyes without blushing.

The film is surprisingly well-

cast, and Johnson’s performance 
as Ana is especially strong. She 
embodies the dichotomy of Ana’s 
character perfectly — despite her 
contractual status as a submissive, 
she’s smart and self-confident, 
always setting her limits and pull-
ing back when Christian doesn’t 
treat her with respect. Dornan 
gives a slightly less compelling 
performance as Mr. Grey, but with 
those eyes that seem to simulta-
neously scream “fuck me” and 
“I have a room full of zip ties and 
tape and I might use them for more 
than just sex stuff,” he embod-
ies the character even without a 
spectacular performance. Despite 
rumors that the two actors despise 
one another in real life, they exude 
chemistry whenever they share 
the screen. Especially in the more 
tender scenes where Christian 
exposes his emotional vulnerabil-
ity, Johnson and Dornan shine as 
a couple.

But their romantic encoun-

ters translate rather poorly to the 
screen. Maybe it’s because the film 
is rated R instead of the NC-17 that 
the book surely merits, but the sex 

scenes are remarkably unsexy. 
Nudity isn’t a crucial component 
for a scene to be steamy; still, it’s 
unfair that the woman must bare 
all and the camera cuts away 
before viewers could glimpse a 
naked man. For a film shamelessly 
marketed for female viewers, and 
written and directed by women, 
the film displays Ana like some 
piece of spineless meat rather than 
the strong lady we (and Christian) 
know she is. Christian holds his 
whip and leers at her, while the 
camera shows her suffering from 
his point of view. The screen rarely 
affords us her perspective. This is 
quite a far cry from a novel narrat-
ed by Ana. And much of what goes 
on in the playroom doesn’t read as 
particularly titillating. Everyone 
around me in the theater burst 
into giggles when Christian tick-
led Ana with a giant, absurd prop 
peacock feather. This silliness is 
characteristic of the sex scenes in 
the rest of the movie; for an adap-
tation of an erotic novel, the bed-
room action is fairly flaccid.

“Fifty Shades of Grey” may be 

best encompassed with the words 
of Christian Grey: this movie is 
“fifty shades of fucked-up.” While 
it’s endowed with a good cast and 
features solid filmmaking, like 
Christian himself, the movie has 
a hollow heart. With the abusive 
undertones implied in Christian’s 
final seduction and an ending 
that gives viewers the cinematic

Kanye goes couture

By MARA MACLEAN

For the Daily

Just a few days before New York 

Fashion Week, square, crinkled, 
plastic packages were sent to 
some of fashion and music’s big-
gest names. After a few cryptic 
instagrams of the anorak invites 
from Eva Chen and Khloé Kar-
dashian appeared online, Kanye 
West revealed Yeezy Season 1, his 
sportswear 
collaboration 
with 

Adidas, would be shown on Feb. 12 
as part of fashion week.

Yeezy Season 1 didn’t seem to 

be as much about the clothing, 
but more about West’s reasoning 
behind creating. He shared his 
philosophy in a voice recording 
before the models were illuminat-
ed in uniform rows.

“I want people to feel like it’s 

OK to create and follow what their 
dreams are and not feel boxed in. I 
want people to feel like awesome is 
possible,” he said.

West paired with conceptual 

artist Vanessa Beecroft to cap-
ture “the relentless pace of con-
temporary lives.” The collection 
featured many nude bodysuits à la 
Beecroft on models of all shapes 
and sizes. The ripped sweaters 
and oversize sweatshirts were 
not particularly new to the run-
way, but unique additions to an 
athletic wear line nonetheless. 
The jackets and outerwear, like 
the white shearling coat, were 
standouts as compared to the 
rather blah collection.

The line’s accessories — leg 

warmers, oversized backpacks 
and leather duffels — proved 
stronger 
than 
the 
muted 

bodysuits. The Yeezy Boost, a 
chukka boot inspired sneaker, 
was the show’s focus, and right-
fully so. The sneaker showcases 
everything West stands for: inno-
vation, beauty and simplicity.

Love him or hate, Kanye’s 

determination to create is admi-
rable. The collection, in terms 
of aesthetic quality, was not 
exactly comparable to Thakoon 
or Comme des Garçons. How-
ever, there is much to be said 
for West’s commitment to doing 
something different, even if it’s 
30 plus looks involving tights.

He wanted to show that no 

artist should fear creating or 
awesomeness. West is consumed 
by the idea of what impact he 
will leave on the world. Some 
believe this to be arrogant or 
narcissistic, but aren’t we all 
trying to leave a positive impact, 
whatever that may be? Kanye is 
pursuing every different route of 
art in the hopes of a great effect. 
So what if he calls himself a 
designer? He’s trying, he’s creat-
ing, he’s promoting this lifestyle. 
And he has Anna Wintour’s 
backing.

But even if fashion isn’t his 

forte, West closed the show with 
his new single “Wolves” featur-
ing Sia and it was dope.

fter Northwestern took its first lead of the game with 4.3 
seconds remaining, senior guard Shannon Smith raced down 
the court to get close enough for one last 

heave. She stopped five feet behind the 3-point 
line and put up a wild shot.

The ball hit the front of the rim before dropping 

to the floor, game over, 63-62, Northwestern. 
The Wildcats’ first lead of the game was the most 
important one, the last one.

On the sideline, all Michigan women’s 

basketball coach Kim Barnes Arico could do was 
cross her arms and stand there, stunned, just like 
all 2,129 people in attendance at Crisler Center.

Sophomore guard Madison Ristovski and 

senior forward Cyesha Goree each missed a pair of free throws before 
Northwestern forward Nia Coffey took the ball from coast to coast for 

the go-ahead layup.

And that’s all it took. Just a few made free throws, and the game 

could’ve been so much different.

But this wasn’t the first time just a few missed free throws or 

layups made the difference. That’s all it has taken for almost all of 
Michigan’s losses in the conference.

On Jan. 7 at No. 18 Rutgers, after being down by as many as 19 

points, the Wolverines climbed their way back into the game to tie it 
at 51 with 10 minutes left in the game.

But Michigan couldn’t punch through and take the lead. It missed 

a few shots, and Rutgers dominated the rest of the way. Maybe if the 
Wolverines took the lead, they could’ve held on for the win.

On Jan. 22 at No. 14 Iowa, Michigan used a late run to get back to 

within four points of the Hawkeyes after being down for a majority of 
the game. But once again, a missed few shots and turnovers later, and 
the Wolverines walked off the court with a loss.

On Feb. 1 at No. 22 Nebraska, Michigan led by six at halftime before 

shooting 35.6 percent in the second half, as Nebraska went on a 25-6 
run to walk away with the victory.

On Feb. 8 against Rutgers at home, the Wolverines put on another 

late run to draw within two with four minutes remaining in the 
game. But once again, sophomore guard Siera Thompson and junior 
guard Madison Ristovski each missed 3-pointers that would have 
put Michigan ahead, and the Scarlet Knights pulled away to win the 
game, 57-50.

On Feb. 10 at Ohio State, the Wolverines went up by 12 with less 

than 10 minutes left in the game. But as their defensive intensity 
faded due to foul trouble, so did Michigan’s offensive efficiency. The 
Buckeyes used a 10-0 run to get the game within one before taking 
over with two minutes left in the game to pull out the victory.

And Saturday in Ann Arbor, maybe it was the missed free throws 

or maybe it was a missed 

DATE WITH
DISASTER

T

he Michigan hockey team 
has finally fallen back 
down to earth.

Searching for a series split 

Saturday at Minnesota, the 
Wolverines conceded the game’s 
first goal within four minutes 
of the opening whistle. Junior 
goaltender Steve Racine watched 
the puck whiz over his left 
shoulder, prompting him to slam 
his fists on his 
knees.

In a grinding, 

defensive battle, 
it would stand 
as the eventual 
game-winner 
and a moment 
of frustration 
crammed into 
a weekend of 
uncertainty.

The loss was 

Michigan’s third 
in four games, 
all of which 
came after a 
seven-game 
winning streak. 
But after the game, Racine said it isn’t was time to 
go back to the drawing board just yet.

“I don’t think so,” Racine said. “This is probably 

one of the top-three hardest buildings to play in in 
the country. Just to come away with points would 
have been nice, but we know what kind of team 
we have going forward, and I think we just have to 
keep doing what we’re doing.”

Optimism is nice and fluffy and comfortable, 

but this isn’t the time for Michigan to celebrate 
moral victories. This weekend provided a valuable 
opportunity to separate from the rest of the Big 
Ten. Instead, two points now separate four teams.

Junior forward Boo Nieves had different 

sentiments from 
Racine before 
Saturday’s 
game — you 
know, the night 
the Wolverines 
almost beat an 
unranked team 
that entered the 
weekend six 
points behind 
them in the 
conference 
standings.

“One of the 

biggest things 
is to not get 
complacent,” 
Nieves said. 

“We swept this team at our place, and now we’re 
kind of in the same position they were Friday night 
at Yost. So I think we need to regroup and get back 

to basics and do the things that are helping us win.”

Those things that were helping Michigan win 

involved limiting turnovers and driving pucks and 
bodies to the net. At times, the defensive effort was 
enough to get by. But this weekend, all those things 
were moot. Minnesota was the better team, and it 
showed.

More than anything, though, an unsustainable 

offense that scored 52 goals in its first eight 
conference games has been grounded. It’s that 
offense that helped hide a suspect defense and keep 

the Wolverines’ 
inconsistent 
goaltending 
somewhere safe.

It was like 

when Mom asks 
you to clean your 
room and you 
shove everything 
under the bed 
hoping she’ll 
never notice. In 
Michigan’s case, 
Minnesota took 
note and threw 
everything 
into the open 
for the entire 
neighborhood 

to see.

The Wolverines were sloppy in their own 

zone Friday, and the goaltending was poor. The 

defensive concerns they started the season with 
surfaced yet again, prompting an inevitable change.

“The goals went in too easy,” said Michigan 

coach Red Berenson.

Following an embarrassing 6-2 loss on Friday, he 

went back to the drawing board. He had to.

Racine started in net after sophomore Zach 

Nagelvoort’s performance on Friday was well 
below Berenson’s standards. In doing so, Berenson 
restarted the seemingly endless goaltending 
carousel he’s been riding this season.

It almost 

worked. Racine 
made 31 saves 
Saturday, many 
of them as he 
was sprawled 
out, and lying 
on his back, and 
in any position 
but upright. It 
was arguably 
his best 
performance of 
the season, but 
all he received 
in return was a 
2-0 loss and a 
pat on the back.

Moving 

forward, Michigan has to make changes. It’s left 
with no other choice as a result of injuries and

Through steel blue eyes

T

he first thing you notice 
when you walk into her 
office are the framed 

newspapers 
resting on a 
shelf oppo-
site the door. 
One screams 
the head-
line “His-
tory Makers.” 
The other, 
“Champions 
in the West.”

Then you 

turn right, 
toward her desk. There, you 
see the large stuffed wolverine 
atop the cabinets on her wall, 
and then the numerous Big 
Ten championship trophies 
positioned carefully in 
mahogany-colored cubbies.

Your eyes are drawn to the 

white sheet of paper pinned 
to the wall behind her right 
shoulder. It’s a to-do list written 
neatly in black marker, thick 
enough so you can clearly read 
items six and seven:

6. Call in one of my players. 7. 

Make them cry.

Later, you’ll ask about it, 

and she’ll explain the list 
was made by a player as a 
gag for Halloween. She’ll tell 
you why she keeps it: the list 
is “hilarious,” but also “not 
inaccurate.”

But you don’t know that yet. 

You wonder if she could make 
you cry.

As she glares at you through 

steel blue eyes, you decide she 
probably could.

* * *

C

arol Hutchins is the face 
of Michigan softball, 
though she’ll disagree 

vehemently with the notion, 
citing Bo Schembechler’s “The 
Team” speech in the process.

Never mind that you can’t 

seem to escape her stare 

anywhere inside the new 
softball center. There’s a large 
cardboard cutout of Hutchins 
by the stairs, for instance, 
and pictures of her on walls 
throughout the building.

“I’m not very happy about 

that,” she said. “I’ve just been 
the fortunate one to get to be the 
leader of the program. … If I up 
and retire tomorrow, it’s going 
to be here. My goal is to leave 
it standing strong, to put it in 
position to be successful.”

But her achievements speak 

for themselves: In 30 years, 
never a losing season; 17 Big 
Ten crowns; 16 NCAA regional 
titles; and the first national 
championship won by a program 
east of the Mississippi River.

So too do the challenges 

she overcame to reach those 
milestones.

There were the years before 

universities 
properly valued 
women’s 
sports, when 
she had to 
work double-
duty as both 
the softball 
coach and as 
a secretary, 
or how she 
sometimes had 
to tend to the 
outfield grass herself.

Today, Hutchins enjoys the 

use of world-class softball 
facilities — even if she scorns at 
how much her face is plastered 
on them.

“I certainly have seen a lot of 

years,” she said. “The growth 
of women in sport, especially 

women 
in college 
athletics — I 
could have 
never dreamed 
it.

“I’m still a 

coach because 
I realize it’s 
better than 
working 
for a living. 
Coaching 

is about a life, and it’s about a 
family. It’s what I do. It’s what 
I love.”

Michigan moved into that 

new softball center just over 
than a year ago, but there’s 

already a minor issue. One 
wall in a conference room is 
dedicated to celebration photos 
of all of the Wolverines’ Big Ten-
champion teams.

When Michigan won its 17th 

such title last spring, someone 
noticed there wasn’t any more 
space left for their picture.

“We need a bigger wall,” 

Hutchins said with a laugh.

* * *

T

he color in Hutchins’ 
eyes comes from her 
mother. The intensity 

behind them, from her father.

He was a Marine and a cop, 

and he made sure Hutchins 
valued two things: discipline 
and honesty. From his strict 

parenting came her imposing 
personality.

“There was never one day in 

my life that I felt like my dad 
didn’t love me,” she recalled. 
“I knew he loved me, but I was 
afraid of him, and I was never 
going to get in trouble with 
him. I would venture to say that 
I am really hard on my kids, 
because I want them to achieve 
the greatest thing they can. I 
want them to get the most out of 
their career because that’s what 
success is.”

Hutchins’ goal at Michigan 

isn’t to win, though that has 
virtually always been a side 
effect. Rather, she strives to 
turn “weak-minded kids” into 
graduating classes of leaders 
who understand “it’s OK to be a 
strong woman.”

“Learning it is where there’s 

tears,” she said. “Learning it 
is where you go through those 
tough times. It’s not all comfy.”

She’s not promising to be 

nice, or to be a friend, or to be a 
mother figure, but she vows to 
push her players to greatness.

And Hutchins expects there 

to be rough patches along the 
way. She expects frustration. 
She expects them to cry — as 
long as her players know she 
cares about them.

“That’s what you do to people 

you love — you push them,” she 
said. “I know they’re kids. I know 
they’re not going to be perfect. 
That, though, is not an excuse.

“I’m here to say, ‘Fall down? 

Get up.’ That’s what we do. 
That’s how you grow up.”

So while step No. 7 on her 

mock to-do list involves pushing 
people to tears, it’s only as a 
precursor for item No. 9:

Make the team great.
There’s no doubt she has done 

that.

inconsistency. Even if it isn’t 
Berenson’s first choice, and 
if the Wolverines have been 
satisfied with beating mediocre 
teams in a mediocre Big Ten, 
complacency will incite a steady 
decline.

The most costly turnover of 

the weekend, and perhaps of the 
season, came late in the second 
period of Saturday’s game when 
junior forward Andrew Copp 
laid a pass off at the blue line 
that was picked off.

Copp raced back to 

Michigan’s zone to stymie 
a breakaway opportunity,

Minnesota’s Travis Boyd he fell 
hard into the boards, crunching 
his left arm and left shoulder in 
the process.

spot.

Despite strong

drops finale

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

MINNEAPOLIS — It was 

an unconventional play, but 
with 
desperation 
mounting, 

freshman forward Dylan Larkin 
got 
down 

on all fours 
right 
by 

his team’s 
bench to stop forward Hunter 
Fasching 
from 
scoring 
an 

empty-net goal.

The play worked, but the 

puck broke loose. Moments 
later, Larkin banged his helmet, 
then his hands, then his stick on 
the boards. Minnesota forward 
Kyle Rau had netted the goal 
— his fourth of the weekend 
— putting a dagger in the No. 
12 Michigan hockey team’s 
comeback efforts.

The Wolverines (8-4 Big Ten, 

16-10 overall) had just spent 
56 minutes trying to avenge 
an early goal. The efforts were 
all for naught, as the Golden 
Gophers (6-2-3, 16-9-3) held on 
for a 2-0 win and the weekend 
sweep.

Though 
the 
defeat 
was 

Michigan’s third loss in four 
games, 
its 
improved 
effort 

against a strong team on the 
road didn’t go unnoticed.

“I thought our team played 

harder,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “We played well. 
Both teams were stingy, both 
goalies played well. We’ve got 
to score a goal to win the game, 
and we couldn’t score one.”

After dominating Friday’s 

game by a score of 6-2, the 
Golden Gophers picked up right 
where they left off just four 
minutes into the game. As two 
Wolverines were occupied with 
a big hit on the boards, forward 
Seth Ambroz fired a high 
screamer past junior goaltender 
Steve Racine to give Minnesota 
a 1-0 lead.

Despite the early setback, 

Michigan 
— 
Racine 
in 

particular — settled in for a fast 
and physical first period. The 
forwards had a number of good 
looks and near-misses as the 
defense cleaned up its passing 
on the other end.

That effort carried into the 

second period, but as the shots 
piled up, Racine and Minnesota 
goaltender 
Adam 
Wilcox 

seemed to only get better in the 
back-and-forth battle. In total, 
Racine stopped 31 of 32 shots in 
his first start since Jan. 16.

“He gave us a chance,” 

Berenson said. “Your goalie 
comes in here and gives up one 
goal against a team like that, 
you’re going to have a chance at 
winning. We just didn’t get the 
goals that he needed.”

Added Racine: “I was just 

seeing 
pucks 
well. 
We’ve 

been talking a lot about my 
preparation 
going 
into 
the 

games. I thought my preparation 
today was really good.”

With nine minutes to go in 

the second period, what had 
been a fast-paced game came 
to a troublesome halt. Copp 
and Minnesota forward Travis 
Boyd, tangled up in the midst of 
an increasingly physical game, 
flew into the board behind 
Racine hard enough to bring the 
crowd to its feet.

While the fans at Mariucci 

Arena wanted a penalty on 
Copp, the junior proved to be 
the real victim of the collision, 
failing to get up for several 
minutes. Though he was seen 
without a cast after the game, 
it remains to be seen just how 
long the team’s captain will be 
off the ice.

The Wolverines were without 

their captain for the rest of the 
game, but continued their strong 
play, actually outshooting the 
Golden Gophers once Copp 
went to the locker room.

But as the clock wore down, 

frustration set in for Michigan. 
Once scoring 4.36 goals per 
game, the Wolverines were shut 
out for the first time all season. 
Rejection by rejection, Wilcox 

was able to get inside the heads 
of Michigan’s players. Moving 
forward, senior Zach Hyman 
knows that can’t happen again.

“We’ve got to keep shooting, 

keep throwing it at the net,” 
the forward said. “We can’t get 
frustrated. We’ve got to keep 
putting it on net, and eventually 
if we do the right things, staying 
in our system, it’s going to go 
in.”

Still trailing 1-0 in the third 

period, Michigan picked up 
its pace. Minnesota matched, 
however, every shot, hit and 
save 
the 
Wolverines 
made, 

ultimately pulling off the win 
and pulling into a tie for first 
place in the Big Ten.

It was an improved effort for 

Michigan, but in Minneapolis 
against a team that is 5-0-1 
in the past three weekends, it 
simply wasn’t enough to win.

“I’m happy with our game 

tonight,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“I 

didn’t like the outcome, but I 
thought our team played much 
better. We gave ourselves a 
chance, but then we couldn’t 
score. One thing we’ve been 
able to do is score goals, but we 
couldn’t tonight.”

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily

Michigan coach Red Berenson’s team has lost three of its past four games against Michigan State and Minnesota after winning 13 of its previous 16.

Copp’s injury, but it doesn’t look 
promising. Berenson may have to 
plan accordingly to shift around 
lines that have showcased 
chemistry and depth all season 
long. Racine made his case as 
the new starting goaltender 
for a second time this season, 
and Berenson will have to plan 
accordingly.

And now that the Wolverines 

no longer have a tight grasp 
on first place in the Big Ten 
standings, Berenson will have to 
plan accordingly.

Change is difficult and 

sometimes unwanted, but at 
the same time, it’s usually 
warranted. Michigan hasn’t had 
its back against the wall since 
mid-November. Back then, it 
responded by winning 13 of its 
next 15 games.

It’s now mid-February, and the 

Wolverines are stuck again. They 
need a triumphant response, 
something they’re capable of.

And willing or unwilling, 

change is something they’ll have 
to accept.

‘M’ sweeps FSU, weekend

Wolverines avenge 
Super Regional loss 
in 5-0 weekend at 

Florida State

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

With two outs, the tying run 

on third and the winning run 
on second, Michigan softball 
coach Carol Hutchins turned 
to 
sophomore 
right-handed 

pitcher Megan Betsa.

“Are you ready? Go up there 

and strike them out,” Hutchins 
said, with Michigan leading No. 
6 Florida State, 6-5.

It took just nine pitches for 

Betsa to retire the final two 
batters, striking out the first 
and forcing a flyout to end the 
game.

With those nine pitches, 

Betsa earned her first career 
save and the eighth-ranked 
Wolverines’ (8-1) first of two 
victories against the Seminoles 
on the weekend. For Betsa, the 
night was still not done — it was 
her turn to start in the second 
game 
of 
the 
doubleheader. 

Allowing just two hits and one 
run, she pitched a complete 
game, helping Michigan take a 
2-1 victory in the game Saturday 
night.

“She 
was 

outstanding,” 
Hutchins said. 
“She’s 
the 

one you want 
at 
the 
end 

of the game 
because she’s 
a 
strikeout 

pitcher. When 
they have the 
winning run on second base, the 
best thing you can do is strike 
them out.”

Including the crucial back-to-

back wins over the Seminoles, 
Michigan swept through all 
of its opponents this weekend, 

dominating both at the plate 
and in the field.

Saturday was highlighted 

by the pitching duel between 
Betsa and Florida State’s Lacey 
Waldrop, the same pitcher who 
eliminated 
the 
Wolverines 

from the NCAA Tournament 
last year. Waldrop pitched the 

final 
three 

innings 
in 

the day game 
and the entire 
second 
game 

on 
Saturday, 

but she still 
had 
the 

energy to keep 
going.

“She 
has 

the ability to 

throw a lot of innings,” Betsa 
said. “She’s one of the best 
in the country. It felt good to 
get that win against her. My 
job was to put zeroes on the 
board, and I did that as best as 
I could.”

Added sophomore left fielder 

Kelly Christner: “(Hutchins) 
came out afterwards and said 
we had great energy going out 
last night and hitting well off 
of (Waldrop). She’s an amazing 
pitcher. We went out there, hit 
her pretty well and shut them 
down.”

Christner, who has gotten on 

base in every game this season, 
is one of many reasons that 
the Wolverines succeeded on 
offense this weekend.

After last weekend’s four-

game series, Hutchins said her 
team was underachieving with 
its bats.

A week of practice certainly 

changed that.

In 
just 
five 
games 
in 

Tallahassee, three of which 
were cut short by the mercy 
rule, the Wolverines pounded 
out 36 runs.

To mercy an opponent, a 

team must be ahead by at least 
eight runs after five innings. 

Michigan 
did 
that 
against 

Western Kentucky and twice 
against Georgia Tech.

Friday, 
the 
eighth-ranked 

Wolverines defeated Western 
Kentucky and Georgia Tech 
by scores of 8-0 and 10-0, 
respectively. Sunday morning, 
Michigan battled with Georgia 
Tech again, this time winning 
10-2.

The 
batting 
surge 
came 

from multiple outlets. Against 
Western Kentucky, freshman 
first 
baseman 
Tera 
Blanco 

registered four RBI. Senior 
catcher Lauren Sweet got the 
ball rolling in the second game 
against Georgia Tech, powering 
a grand slam over the walls of 
JoAnne Graf Field in the first 
inning.

Sunday morning, Michigan 

went up against the Yellow 
Jackets again. Taking a four-
run lead after the first inning 
put Michigan well on track to a 
similar result.

Michigan falls to
top-ranked Iowa

By CHLOE AUBUCHON 

Daily Sports Writer

In its final match of the Big Ten 

dual season, the No. 16 Michigan 
wrestling team learned that when 
it faces off against the best, it has 
to bring its best to the mat.

While 

the 
Wolverines 
hung 
in 

with No. 1 Iowa (9-0 Big Ten, 14-0 
overall), they were unable to pull 
off the upset, falling 22-9.

For 
Michigan, 
the 
night 

consisted of a series of close 
battles with several disappointing 
endings. Though the Wolverines 
(4-5, 6-6) had a strong showing 
— all but one of their seven losses 
came by six points or fewer — they 
never led at any point in the meet, 
even with their three individual 
wins.

“(Iowa is) a tough place to 

wrestle, 
and 
it’s 
a 
physical 

team,” said Michigan coach Joe 
McFarland.

Sophomores Brian Murphy, 

Domenic Abounader and Adam 
Coon all put Michigan on the 
board with decision wins in 
the 157-pound, 184-pound and 
heavyweight classes, respectively. 
Abounader 
and 
Coon 
each 

defeated 
higher-ranked 

opponents.

Murphy and Abounader ended 

the Big Ten dual season with a 7-2 
record each, while Coon went 7-1.

Murphy, ranked No. 10 in 

his weight class, earned the 
Wolverines’ first win of the 
night in a 7-2 decision over the 
Hawkeyes’ 16th-ranked Michael 
Kelly. After four losses to start 
off the meet, Murphy cut Iowa’s 
lead, 13-3. The sophomore came 
out strong, finishing with two 
takedowns, a reversal in the third 
period and 1:42 in riding-time 
advantage.

Riding time proved to be an 

issue for Michigan, with Murphy 
being the only wrestler to take the 
advantage while the Hawkeyes 
did so five times. Freshman Alec 
Pantaleo fell, 2-1, at 149 pounds 
after his opponent gained 1:27 
in riding-time advantage for the 
winning point.

“We could all work on the mat 

with top and bottom wrestling,” 
Abounader said. “In that aspect, 
we didn’t do very well this 
weekend, myself included.”

At 
184 
pounds, 
No. 
12 

Abounader held on to earn a 
3-2 decision over Iowa’s eighth-
ranked 
Sammy 
Brooks. 
The 

match was deadlocked as each 
wrestler attempted to finish on 
single-leg 
attacks. 
Abounader 

eventually countered a flurry with 
a successful single-leg attack to 
earn the decision with 20 seconds 
remaining in the match.

In the final bout of the 

meet, Coon, ranked No. 7, took 
home a thrilling decision in 
overtime against second-ranked 
heavyweight 
Bobby 
Telford. 

After 
back-and-forth 
escapes 

during regulation, Coon fought 
off a single-leg attack in the last 
20 seconds of the sudden-victory 
period. Going into the tiebreaker 
periods, Coon capitalized on his 
opponent’s exhaustion, earning 
the decision on a reversal in the 
second tiebreaker frame.

“You just have to trust your 

training,” Coon said. “Going into 
the tiebreaker situation, you just 
have to keep your mind straight 
and trust your training that you’re 
better conditioned and you know 
what to do in that situation.”

Despite the loss, the Wolverines 

were pleased with their tenacity 
against 
the 
Big 
Ten’s 
top 

contender. As they head into the 
Big Ten Championships, they will 
look to turn their tenacity into 
results.

WRESTLING

Michigan starts 
2-0 for first time

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Detroit may not be the 

Michigan men’s lacrosse team’s 
biggest 
rival, 
but 

that didn’t 
stop 
the 

Wolverines from bringing loads 
of intensity into Saturday’s 
matchup.

Sophomore 
attacker 
Ian 

King led Michigan in scoring, 
setting a program record with 
six goals in the game. King’s 
efforts, combined with strong 
defense in the second half, were 
enough for the Wolverines to 
earn a 15-6 victory and move 
to 2-0 for the first time in 
program history.

No one was happier to see 

King 
score 
than 
Michigan 

coach John Paul, who gave 
the attacker grief after going 
scoreless against Bellarmine.

“I knew King was going to 

get his goals,” Paul said. “Last 
week was kind of an anomaly. I 
thought he played a smart game 
too and didn’t take any bad 
shots or make any mistakes.”

King’s 
fellow 
starting 

attackers, 
seniors 
David 

McCormack and Will Meter, 
also found the back of the net. 
Sophomore midfielder Mikie 
Schlosser followed a four-goal 
outing 
against 
Bellarmine 

last week with two more as 
Michigan’s 
offense 
had 
no 

trouble figuring out the Titan’s 
defense.

“We just cut out and got 

open,” 
said 
redshirt 
junior 

midfielder 
David 
Joseph. 

“When (Detroit) pressed out, 
we used it to our advantage. 
That opened up our attack for 
easy goals and finishes.”

The Wolverines jumped out 

to an early 5-1 lead thanks to 
junior faceoff man Brad Lott’s 
perfect seven-for-seven first-
quarter performance.

Lott 
faced 
two 
different 

Detroit players, but regardless 
of the challenger, he was able 
to get the job done. Lott’s 
dominance in the faceoff circle 
led to Michigan’s complete 
control 
of 
possession 
and 

allowed its offense to settle in.

“The first period’s big because 

you want to get into a rhythm,” 
Lott said. “As a unit we were 
getting together and figuring 
out everything we needed to do, 
so no matter who we faced, we 
were getting it done.”

While the Wolverines’ attack 

continued to cruise in the 
second half, Michigan’s defense 
stepped up to shut down any 
hopes of a Titan comeback. The 
Wolverines would continue to 
maintain possession throughout 
the period.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

goalkeeper Gerald Logan earned 
six saves en route to giving up 
only one second-half goal.

“(Logan) was seeing the ball 

better in the second half,” Paul 
said. “Our offense was getting 
long 
possessions. 
(Detroit) 

really didn’t have the ball that 
much. That’s defense, through 
having a great offense.”

Paul believes the Wolverines’ 

performance against the Titans 
was one of the most balanced he 
has ever seen. Michigan outshot 
Detroit 52-28, and Paul credited 
the margin to playing mistake-
free lacrosse.

Not 
only 
was 
Michigan 

pleased with the result on the 
field, but also for what the 
victory means off the field 
too. Ever since the Titans took 
Michigan to overtime last year, 
many players have taken the 
in-state matchup personally.

“So much for us right now is 

about confidence,” Paul said. 
“We’re coming out of these first 
two games pretty confident. 
When we have a team that 
hasn’t really proven anything 
yet, confidence is the step you 
need to start actually proving 
it.”

Wolverines smacked by Florida

Michigan drops 

first game of 

second season in 
blowout fashion

By KATIE CONKLIN

For the Daily

Preparing for season number 

two for the Michigan women’s 
lacrosse team was no easy task, 
especially when the opening 
game 
was 
against 
national 

powerhouse Florida. Ranked 
fourth in the nation by both 
the IWLCA Coaches and Inside 
Lacrosse 
polls, 
the 

Gators play 
a 
strong, 

quick game that is hard to beat.

Coming into this season, 

Michigan remains a young team 
comprised of 23 sophomores 
and and 12 freshmen. Florida, 
on the other hand, boasted 
many veteran players, including 
redshirt junior Nicole Graziano 
and senior midfielder Nora 
Barry. 
Combined, 
the 
two 

scored a total of five goals in 
Florida’s 21-0 victory over the 
Wolverines 
on 
Saturday 
in 

Gainesville.

The Gators snuck their first 

goal 
past 
Michigan 
goalie 

Allison Silber after just 28 
seconds of play. Fifteen more 
were recorded in Florida’s favor 
to round out the first half.

Three 
Florida 
players 

finished the game with a hat 
trick and nine other players 
contributed to the score as well. 
It was the Gators’ first shutout 
win since 2012.

“Today, I have to say this is 

probably the worst performance 
of our program’s history,” said 
Michigan coach Jennifer Ulehla. 
“I’m proud of the fact that they 
didn’t give up and that we had a 
much better second half, but it’s 
definitely disappointing the way 
we came out.”

The 
Wolverines 
have 
a 

difficult road ahead in the 
inaugural year of Big Ten 
women’s lacrosse. They will 
be 
competing 
against 
the 

likes of No. 1 Maryland, No. 5 
Northwestern, and other top-20 
teams. Ulehla, though, expects 
her team to rise to the challenge.

“This year, we’re going to 

have a big growth spurt, and it 
will be sooner than the one we 
had last year,” Ulehla said.

To do so, the team will focus 

on draw controls and getting 
more looks on the net.

“We’ve got 

to get more 
shots off to 
give 
us 
an 

opportunity 
to 
obviously 

score 
some 

goals,” Ulehla 
said.

Another 

aspect 
of 

improvement 
is Michigan’s 
new defensive style. After going 
down 16-0 in the first half of 
the game, the Wolverines came 
out in a backer-style defense for 
the remainder of the game. In 

this formation, six of the seven 
defenders 
control 
one-sixth 

of the 12-meter arc, while the 
backer follows the ball around 
the eight-meter.

Florida was able to break 

this defensive setup just five 
times, and was unable to run 
individual drives to the net from 
the outside.

“We were excited to try 

(backer 
defense) 
today 
and 
I 

thought 
that 

it went really 
well. As the 
season 
goes 

on, we hope to 
improve it and 
perfect it,” said 
sophomore 
defensive 
backer Brooke 

Pancoast.

Another important feature 

of Team Two is sophomore 
goaltender 
Allison 
Silber. 

Though surrendering 21 goals 

was difficult, there were some 
bright spots. With eight saves 
this Saturday, Silber was able 
to stop Florida attackers from 
scoring for nearly 10 minutes by 
making four straight saves.

“Allison is really positive 

and she’s a great supporter,” 
Pancoast said. “She’s really 
great to have as a leader.”

As a big part of the rise of 

the Florida program from 2008 
to 2010, Ulehla knows what it 
takes to become a nationally 
competitive team. Leadership, 
she says, is a crucial part of 
“building 
a 
championship 

foundation” for the future.

“We have a group approach 

to leadership,” Ulehla said. 
“I think (the players) have to 
recognize it themselves and 
really take ownership of the 
differences they can make.

“We’re working hard to get 

better every day and today was 
obviously not, by far, our best 
day. But we have no doubt in the 
future this program.”

Michigan squanders late lead

Northwestern goes 

coast to coast in 
final seconds to 
upend Wolverines

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team hadn’t scored in 
just under two and a half minutes 
when 
junior 
guard 
Madison 
Ristovski stepped up to the foul 
line with 14 seconds left in the 
game.

With the Wolverines holding 

a 62-61 lead and Northwestern 
clinging to the hope of making 
a comeback in the final minutes, 
both of Ristovski’s shots missed. 
But 
senior 
forward 
Cyesha 

Goree came in and collected the 
rebound, so she stepped up to the 
line with 10 seconds left.

Then she missed both tries and 

the atmosphere in Crisler Center 
changed dramatically.

Wildcat forward Nia Coffey 

— who ended the game with 25 
points — took it to the other end of 
the court and made a layup with 
four seconds left. On the inbound, 
a potential buzzer beater by senior 
guard Shannon Smith fell short of 
the basket, giving Northwestern 
a 63-62 win that will likely prove 
damaging to the Wolverines’ 
NCAA Tournament hopes.

“Normally, we make those free 

throws,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “Madison, 
probably in her career, is over an 
80 percent free-throw shooter. 
To miss two is really surprising. 
Then to miss four is really 
surprising.”

Added Smith: “Every little play 

matters. Whether it’s a free throw, 
getting a loose ball, or getting a 
person out on the defensive end. 
Every play matters.”

Michigan (6-8 Big Ten, 14-11 

overall) shot a dismal 27.6 percent 
from the floor in the second half 
compared to 46.7 in the first, and 
missed eight of its last 10 shots. 
Northwestern (9-5, 19-6) hadn’t 
held a lead all afternoon, but the 
final 10 minutes gave the team 
several opportunities to make it 
happen.

The 
circumstances 
were 

perfect for Northwestern to 
take the lead: Michigan was 
in a scoring slump, all of the 
momentum was on the Wildcats’ 
side and, most importantly, Goree 
had to be taken out of the game at 
four fouls and 12 minutes still left 
in the game.

“Cyesha gets in foul trouble 

and it just changes the dynamics 
of our team, really from an 
offensive 
standpoint,” 
Barnes 

Arico said. “Even if she’s not 

scoring, she gives an inside 
presence and that changes what 
teams do against us defensively.”

Despite 
the 
favorable 

circumstances, 
though, 

something always went awry for 
the Wildcats on each of the next 
few possessions, and it looked 
like the Wolverines might have a 
stroke of luck. That thought was 
short-lived.

After the Wildcats went on 

an 11-0 run to tie the game at 
51 with eight minutes left, they 
stole the ball and guard Karly 
Roser took it to the other end a 
wide-open court. With junior 
guard Madison Ristovski just 
crossing midcourt, Roser’s layup 
rolled around the rim for a few 
moments before falling out and 
into the hands of Ristovski.

Roser got called for a reach-in 

foul and slammed her hands hard 

on the floor. It had been just over 
six minutes since the Wolverines 
had scored, but Ristovski made 
her free throws to push Michigan 
past a potential breaking point.

Even after the Roser hiccup, 

the mishaps continued. On the 
next Northwestern possession 
with the game still tied at 51, 
Roser missed her first on a one-
and-one opportunity at the free-
throw line, giving the ball back 
to the Wolverines. Ristovski stole 
the ball the possession afterward 
and freshman forward Jillian 
Dunston made a layup for a four-
point lead.

Once Dunston had done her 

part, Goree, freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty and senior 
forward 
Nicole 
Elmblad 
all 

subbed back in to finish out 
the game. Goree grabbed the 
necessary defensive rebounds 

— finishing with 10 total boards 
alongside nine points. But at 2:26, 
her pair two points from the free-
throw line were the final ones for 
Michigan, holding on to a five-
point lead.

The Wildcats capitalized on 

the Wolverines’ inability to score, 
making a 6-0 run in the final two 
minutes.

“When we go through stretches 

where we’re not scoring, I think 
we get a little bit down and it 
takes away from our defensive 
intensity,” Elmblad said. “I think 
that was when they were able to 
get back in the game and make 
their run and close it out.”

“To try and get them back 

mentally before this game was 
incredibly difficult,” Barnes Arico 
said. “My heart goes out to them 
because they’ve been so close, and 
that’s what makes it so difficult.”

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Sophomore guard Siera Thompson scored 15 points, but Michigan gave away a late lead and lost its third straight game Saturday against Northwestern.

N’WESTERN
MICHIGAN 

63

3-pointer from freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty or maybe 
it was a missed jumper from 
senior forward Nicole Elmblad. 
Without any one of those 
miscues, Michigan wouldn’t 
have faltered once again.

Adding the losses up, 

Michigan could be 12-2 in the 
Big Ten and be in position as 
a No. 3 or 4 seed in the NCAA 
Tournament. Even if it had lost 
half of them, it would likely be 
squarely in the tournament.

On the bright side, the 

Wolverines have played almost 
every team in the conference 
competitively, and they have 
four games to go against 
teams below them in the 
conference before the Big Ten 
Tournament.

So they aren’t permanently 

out of the NCAA Tournament 
picture. They just can’t make 
too many more mistakes down 
the stretch.

It’s not over.
But it could be very soon, and 

in another universe, Michigan’s 
season could be far from over.

‘M’ salvages series finale at LBSU

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

A rough start gave way to a 

good finish for the Michigan 
men’s baseball team in Long 
Beach, Calif.

The Wolverines (1-2) dropped 

their Friday and Saturday games 
against Long Beach State (2-1), 
3-2 and 7-2 respectively. But they 
bounced back on Sunday to top 
the Dirtbags, 5-3, in 10 innings. 

“I like how the team responded 

on Sunday after getting kicked 
around,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “They fought back 
and didn’t waiver.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 

snapped out of its funk in the 
fourth inning on Sunday when 
Patrick hit a single with runners 
on first and second to drive in a 
run. Later in the inning, senior 
shortstop Eric Jacobson came 
through with a two-run single to 
put Michigan up 3-0.

Long Beach State chipped 

away at the lead from there as the 
Dirtbags put up a run in both the 
fifth and sixth innings, prompting 
Bakich to pull starter Ryan Nutof 
after 5.2 innings for Lozer. Lozer 
got out of the inning before being 
replaced by sophomore Jackson 
Lamb.

The Wolverines maintained 

their 3-2 lead into the ninth inning 
when redshirt junior Matt Ogden 
was called upon for the save 
opportunity. But with runners on 
first and second with two outs, he 
surrendered an RBI single to the 
Dirtbags’ Derek Domingues to 
send the game into extra innings.

After failing to score for five 

innings, Michigan broke through 
in the 10th when Patrick drew 
a walk to lead off the inning. 
Sophomore second baseman Jake 
Bivens was hit by a pitch with 
one out to put runners on first 
and second and a groundout by 
Jacobson moved both runners 
ahead by 90 feet.

That 
left 
the 
Wolverines’ 

hopes in the hands of junior first 
baseman 
Jacob 
Cronenworth, 

who delivered with a two-run 
single to left field to give Michigan 
a 5-3 lead that would hold through 
the bottom of the frame.

“You could feel the energy in 

the dugout after Cronenworth’s 
hit,” Bakich said. “But it was a 
team effort. There were a lot of 
good contributions from a lot of 
guys.”

Michigan got off to a promising 

start on Friday night when junior 
right fielder Cody Bruder hit a 
double to left field in the first 
inning. Junior 
shortstop 
Travis Maezes 
brought 
Bruder home 
with an RBI 
double 
on 

the 
next 

at 
bat. 
The 

Wolverines 
doubled their 
lead 
in 
the 

fourth when fifth-year senior 
designated hitter Kendall Patrick 
doubled down the left-field line 
and scored on an RBI single by 
freshman third-baseman Drew 
Lugbauer.

Michigan’s pitching was strong 

through the fourth inning as well. 
Sophomore pitcher Brett Adcock 
surrendered just one hit through 
the first four innings.

“(Adcock) 
gave 
us 
an 

opportunity to win,” Bakich said. 
“He was in a groove there for a 
while.”

But it all unraveled in the 

bottom of the fifth. After the 
Wolverines turned a double play 
for two quick outs, Adcock gave 
up a walk, a single and another 
walk to load the bases. He then 
walked in a run before being 
pulled for Ogden, who missed all 
of 2014 with an injury. 

“I felt (Adcock) sort of hit a 

brick wall in the fifth,” Bakich 
said.

Ogden walked in the tying run, 

but got out of the inning with a 
strikeout before more damage 
could be done. After a scoreless 
top of the sixth for Michigan, 
Ogden came back out to pitch the 
bottom half of the inning. The 
Dirtbags once again scored with 
two outs when Tristan Mercadel 
hit an RBI triple to take the lead. 
Ogden was subsequently replaced 
by sophomore Mac Lozer, who 
nabbed a strikeout to end the 

inning.

Michigan had scoring chances 

late, especially in the top of 
the eighth inning when the 
Wolverines loaded up the bases 
with one out. But a strikeout and 
a groundout closed Michigan’s 
window of opportunity and the 
score remained 3-2. Ogden was 
tagged with the loss.

“I feel some 

of the guys were 
squeezing 
the 

bats a little too 
tightly,” Bakich 
said. 
“We 

need to be in 
those pressure 
situations often 
in 
order 
to 

improve 
as 
a 

team.”

Unlike Friday, the Dirtbags 

wasted no time scoring on 
Saturday as they were up 2-0 
by the end of the first inning 
and extended the lead to 5-0 

by the end of the second. The 
Wolverines’ starter, sophomore 
Keith Lehmann lasted 1.2 innings, 
giving up three runs on three hits.

Freshmen 
relief 
pitchers 

Michael Hendrickson and Bryan 
Pall stopped the bleeding for 
Michigan as they combined for 
5.2 innings, two runs allowed 
and five strikeouts, but the 
Wolverines offense was stifled 
by the Dirtbags’ Tanner Brown. 
Michigan’s two runs came off of 
an RBI single by Bruder in the top 
of the third and a pinch-hit RBI 
double by sophomore outfielder 
Johnny Slater in the seventh.

Michigan’s weekend trip to 

Long Beach was the first of several 
such trips over the next six weeks. 
By the time the Wolverines face 
Bowling Green in their home 
opener on Mar. 24, they will have 
traveled 11,682 miles.

“I don’t think the team is feeling 

jet lag yet,” Bakich said. “But they 
probably will by (Monday).”

“We need to 
be in pressure 
situations like 

that.”

Possession edge 
helps Wolverines 

rout Detroit

Detroit may not be the 

Michigan men’s lacrosse team’s 
biggest rival, but that didn’t 
stop 
the

of the challenger, he was able 
to get the job done. Lott’s 
dominance in the faceoff circle 
led to Michigan’s complete 
control 
of 
possession 
and 

allowed its offense to settle in.

“The first period’s big because 

you want to get into a rhythm,” 
Lott said. “As a unit we were 
getting together and figuring 
out everything we needed to do, 
so no matter who we faced, we 
were getting it done.”

While 
the 
Wolverines’ 

attack continued to cruise in 
the second half, Michigan’s 
defense stepped up to shut 
down any hopes of a Titan 
comeback. 
The 
Wolverines 

would continue to maintain 
possession 
throughout 
the 

period.

Redshirt 
sophomore 

goalkeeper 
Gerald 
Logan 

earned six saves en route to 
giving up only one second-half 
goal.

“(Logan) was seeing the ball 

better in the second half,” Paul 
said. “Our offense was getting 
long 
possessions. 
(Detroit) 

really didn’t have the ball that 
much. That’s defense, through 
having a great offense.”

Paul believes the Wolverines’ 

performance against the Titans 
was one of the most balanced 
he has ever seen. Michigan 
outshot Detroit 52-28, and Paul 
credited the margin to playing 
mistake-free lacrosse.

Not 
only 
was 
Michigan 

pleased with the result on the 
field, but also for what the 
victory means off the field 
too. Ever since the Titans took 
Michigan to overtime last year, 
many players have taken the 
in-state matchup personally.

“So much for us right now 

is about confidence,” Paul said. 
“We’re coming out of these first 
two games pretty confident. 
When we have a team that hasn’t 
really 
proven 
anything 
yet, 

confidence is the step you need 
to start actually proving it.”
