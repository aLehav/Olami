Monday 
morning, 
U.S. 
Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement 
announced 
plans to modify exceptions for 
nonimmigrant college students 
in the fall semester. The press 
release from ICE states if a 
university moves classes fully 
online due to the pandemic, F-1 
and M-1 visa students will not 
be allowed to enter or remain in 
the United States and they must 
take other measures to maintain 
their legal status in the country, 
such as transferring to another 
institution 
that 
is 
offering 
in-person instruction.
Additionally, if a school offers 
a hybrid model of both in-person 
and 
online 
instruction, 
the 
administration must document 
that students are not taking 
a 
fully 
online 
course 
load, 
according to the release. 
These modified exceptions 
came 
a 
few 
weeks 
after 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel announced that 
the University would adopt a 
hybrid model of both online and 
in-person classes, but is prepared 
to switch to a fully online 
system if needed for the fall 

semester. ICE’s announcement 
now 
puts 
both 
universities 
and international students in a 
difficult position about how to 
best proceed with plans for a fall 
semester amid the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Haoyu 
Du is from Beijing, China, 
and 
acknowledged 
the 
recommendation 
for 
international students to transfer 
to institutions offering in-person 
classes. Du said it would be 
extremely difficult to transfer. 
“Most universities end their 
application cycle at the latest 
by May and if you wanted to 
transfer right now it is impossible 
to transfer to a U.S. college,” Du 
said. “Most deadlines have passed 
and we don’t know if universities 
will maintain a model that will 
allow us to maintain our F-1 
status so that option was moot.”
Du has been living with a 
friend in the Ann Arbor area 
since March, and noted his 
initial 
reaction 
to 
the 
ICE 
announcement. 
“Once the policy came out 
I was very shocked,” Du said. 
“I will only have 10 days, if the 
University moves online, before I 
get deported which is horrifying 
to think about. It (would involve) 
paying tens of thousands of 
dollars for trips (home) or getting 

into some sort of detention camp 
and that sent me into a very bad 
place thinking about that.” 
In 
response 
to 
the 
modifications, Schlissel released 
a statement condemning them 
and noting that they restrict 
students’ learning experiences. 
“At the University of Michigan, 
we add our voice to the many in 
higher education to express our 
strong disagreement with the 
temporary 
policy 
announced 
July 6 by the Department of 
Homeland Security to further 
restrict 
the 
educational 
opportunities for international 
students,” Schlissel wrote. 
Schlissel 
added 
that 
the 
University 
administration 
believes that these modifications 
are harmful to valuable members 
of the community.
“We 
continue 
to 
oppose 
arbitrary 
restrictions 
on 
international students who have 
been and continue to be valuable 
members of our community of 
scholars,” Schlissel wrote. “Even 
with this initial review that 
shows a less direct impact on 
our students, we agree with the 
statement from the Association of 
American Universities – of which 
U-M is a member – that calls this

‘Immensely misguided and deeply 
cruel’: ICE modifies exceptions 

Design by Hibah Chughtai

Piada 
Italian 
Street 
Food 
has 
joined the growing list of Ann Arbor 
businesses 
that 
have 
permanently 
closed their doors amid the economic 
fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the epicenter of downtown Ann 
Arbor, the Italian restaurant had 
become a pillar of the town’s culinary 
scene. Now, with the beloved restaurant 
departing, another storefront will again 
sit empty.
Matt Harding, Piada’s director of 
culinary and corporate executive chef, 
confirmed the permanent closure to 
The Daily.
“It makes me sad,” Harding said. 
“We loved servicing the students and 
the people in Ann Arbor. But from a 
business decision, with everything 
going on with COVID, it just didn’t 
make sense going forward.”
For Ann Arbor, the COVID-19 
pandemic hit as rising rent prices and an 
increase in development across the city 
were already putting a strain on local 
businesses; in 2018 alone, 18 businesses 
were forced to close their doors.
Piada was not immune to this strain. 
Harding said the restaurant chain was 
already considering not renewing its 
Ann Arbor lease even before COVID-
19, and that the economic fallout of the 
pandemic just solidified that decision.
“If COVID wouldn’t have happened, 
would we have redone the lease?” 
Harding said. “I don’t think so. But 
when COVID came around, it just 
became all the more clear that it was 
something we had to do.”
The fast-casual food chain opened 
the Ann Arbor location in 2016 after the 
Five Guys that had previously occupied 
the space on South State Street closed 
down. The space sat empty for over a 
year before Piada opened.

Tuesday afternoon, the state 
of Michigan announced during a 
press conference they will be filing 
a court-action lawsuit against the 
federal government and U.S. Sec-
retary of Education Betsy DeVos 
for the distribution of funding 
from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act. 
Along with several other states, 
Michigan Attorney General Dana 
Nessel is leading the lawsuit 
against Devos, citing concerns 
that a new rule favors affluent pri-
vate schools over public schools 
serving low-income students. 
Nessel said The Department of 
Education’s July 1 rule gives pub-
lic school districts two options for 
distributing CARES Act funds.
“Districts can allocate funds 
based on the total number of stu-
dents enrolled in an eligible pri-
vate school, regardless of income 
level, or allocate funds only for 
Title I schools, leaving no CARES 
Act funds available for non-Title I 
public schools,” Nessel said.
Title I schools receive over $14 
billion of federal funding per year 
to help low-income students reach 
education goals.
In a June 25 press release, 
DeVos said the department’s new 
rule recognized that CARES Act 
programs are not Title I programs. 
“There is no reasonable explan-
ation for debating the use of feder-
al funding to serve both public and 
private K-12 students when feder-
al funding, including CARES Act 
funding, flows to both public and 
private higher education institu-
tions,” DeVos said.
However, Nessel noted at the 
press conference that the rule 
could divert necessary funding 
from public schools.
“Public schools in Michigan are 
at risk of losing millions and mil-
lions of dollars in federal funds to 
their private school neighbors,” 
Nessel 
said. 
“Resources 
that 
Congress intended to be allocat-

ed based on low-income student 
enrollment — which is typically 
much higher in public schools 
— could instead be redirected to 
much more affluent public schools 
because of Secretary DeVos’s 
actions.”
Nessel said while the CARES 
Act states districts must provide 
private schools with equitable ser-
vices in the same manner as under 
Title I, Title I only applies to aca-
demically at-risk students.
“Secretary DeVos’s rule and 
guidance ignores plain language 
in the CARES Act and instead dir-
ects local education agencies to 
choose between two options for 
allocating CARES Act funds, nei-
ther of which actually exists in the 
CARES Act,” Nessel said.
State Superintendent Michael 
Rice also noted neither of the 
methods for allocating funds 
under DeVos’s rule align with the 
CARES Act. 
“It puts local school districts 
and local school district leader-
ship in a very uncomfortable pos-
ition, having to choose between 
the plain act language on the one 
hand, and the guidance from the 
U.S. Secretary on the other,” Rice 
said.
Following 
DeVos’s 
rule, 
non-public schools in Michigan 
would receive $16 million more 
than if they followed the funding 
allocations under Title I — money 
Rice said would be drawn away 
from public schools.
“This is enough to buy 63,694 
Chromebooks for students at $259 
per Chromebook, or to buy per-
sonal protective equipment for 
33,944 students at $486 per stu-
dent annually,” Rice said. 
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
noted the CARES Act funding is 
designed to help those most affect-
ed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including low-income commun-
ities and communities of color.
“Schools in these areas deserve 
a government that will support 
them throughout this crisis,” 
Whitmer said. “The DeVos rule 
strips dollars away from schools 
in need of that critical funding. 
She doesn’t share our priorities for 
protecting and improving public 
education, and that’s why today’s

State of Michigan 
sues Betsy Devos

On June 29, the Board of 
Regents approved a budget 
for fiscal year 2020-2021 that 
includes a 1.9 percent increase 
in tuition for the Ann Arbor 
campus and a 5.6 percent 
increase in financial aid for Ann 
Arbor students, even as many 
universities across Michigan 
and the United States opted to 
freeze tuition increase due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Regents 
Paul Brown (D) and Jordan 
Acker (D), who voted against 
the first budget presented last 
Thursday, both voted in favor of 
the new proposal. Acker stated 
that his decision came down to 
promises in the new budget not 
present in the first proposal.
“(The budget) has new pledges 
to eliminate some uncertainty,” 
Acker said. “There’s funding for 
students whose situations have 
changed from COVID. There’s 
no tuition increase for families 
in Michigan whose income is 
under $120,000, and it does 
have a 1.9 percent increase on 
(the 
University’s) 
wealthiest 
students. The one thing that 
I will point out is I do share 
Regent Ryder-Diggs’ concerns 
about statistics when it comes 
to student aid.”
However, 
Acker 
did 
not 
mention 
how 
out-of-state 
students will be impacted by 

the tuition increase.
The budget narrative the 
University published and that 
was provided to the Board of 
Regents in advance of Monday’s 
meeting 
mentions 
extensive 
aid opportunities for in-state 
students. 
However, 
it 
only 
mentions aid for their out-of-
state peers twice.
 “The budget also includes 
aid for nonresident families 
with need,” the narrative reads. 
“... nonresident tuition rates 
compare favorably to private 
peers.” 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen told The Daily 
most out-of-state students will 
see an increase in costs, though 
about 45 percent of out-of-state 
undergrads receive need-based 
grant aid and/or scholarship 
aid, which can be need-based 
or merit-based. This aid totaled 
roughly $185,000,000.
Broekhuizen said the new 
in-state commitments do not 
change the calculation of aid for 
out-of-state students.
However, 
there 
are 
not 
separate budgets for in-state 
and 
out-of-state 
students. 
The 
budget 
authorizes 
$400,000,000 
of 
“reserves” 
to be used to meet financial 
need, but the University has 
not committed to meeting the 
full financial need of out-of-
state students as it does with 
Michigan residents, so it is 
unclear how these reserves will 
be used to help needy out-of-
state students.

Attorney General Dana 
Nessel leads lawsuit over 
COVID-19 funding


University of Michigan alumni 

DeAndree Watson, Central Stu-
dent Government president from 
2011 to 2012, was found dead in 
his car on Sunday morning on 
the 37400 Block of Willow Lane 
in Westland, Mich.

After graduating from the 

University in 2012 with a bach-
elor’s degree in political science, 
Watson served on the Detroit 
City Council as a policy analyst 
and worked closely with Detroit 
Mayor Mike Duggan and Coun-
cilman James Tate. According 
to a statement from Tate, Wat-
son was recently accepted into 
the University of Michigan Law 
School.

During his time at the Uni-

versity, Watson was involved 
on campus as a member of the 
Black Student Union, College 
Democrats, the Dean of Students 
advisory board, the University 
Chapter of the NAACP and Mus-
tard Seed Campus Ministry.

Duggan posted to Facebook 

Monday morning about Watson’s 
passing and the impact that he 
had through his public service in 
Detroit. 

“I am shocked and deeply sad-

dened by the passing of DeAn-
dree Watson,” Duggan wrote. 
“DeAndree was a brilliant policy 
analyst who worked in the Office 
of Councilman James Tate. I got 
to know DeAndree as we worked 
together on the City of Detroit’s 
marijuana ordinance, spearhead-
ed by Councilman Tate. DeAn-
dree was one of Detroit’s rising 
leaders with a deep commitment 
to public service and the city he 
called home. I extend my deepest 
condolences to DeAndree’s fam-
ily, friends, Councilman James 
Tate, Detroit City Council and 
his many colleagues at the City 
of Detroit.” 

Councilman Tate also released 

a statement about the seven years 
he had known and worked with 
Watson and the impact he made 

on Detroit. 

“It is with great sadness that 

I share the tragic passing of 
my team member and friend, 
DeAndree Watson,” the state-
ment read. “This year has been 
challenging to say the least, but 
never did I imagine losing some-
one so integral to our office and 
our city… so soon. DeAndree was 
the epitome of a leader and was 
often the first person to volun-
teer whenever he was needed. 
His impact goes well beyond our 
office as he brought greatness to 
everything he was involved in. 
DeAndree was well on his way to 
further shape our world and I’m 
truly heartbroken that we won’t 
get to witness more of his jour-
ney.”

Officers 
suspect 
Watson’s 

death to be a result of a homi-
cide. Deontez Jones, an associate 
of Watson, was also found dead 
Sunday in a nearby apartment 
from a self-inflicted gunshot 
wound. 

Current CSG President Aman-

da Kaplan and Vice President Sav 
Nandigama released a statement 
on Wednesday signed by every 
CSG and CSA president dating 
back to 1998.

“DeAndree’s 
advocacy 
and 

leadership continues to posi-
tively impact the Michigan stu-
dent experience,” the statement 
read. “During his time, DeAn-
dree 
advocated 
for 
undocu-

mented immigrants to qualify 
for in-state tuition, installed 18 
new water refill stations across 
campus, doubled the child care 
stipend 
available 
to 
gradu-

ate students, and spearheaded 
efforts to get the University to 
create a gender-neutral housing 
pilot program.”

Nandigama also told The Daily 

in an interview that Watson con-
tinued his work after graduation 
and emphasized that he will be 
remembered by his positive per-
sonality.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

With under two months left 

before the start of classes for the 
2020-21 academic year, the Uni-
versity of Michigan Faculty Sen-
ate hosted a town hall meeting 
featuring 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel and Interim Provost 
Susan Collins on Wednesday after-
noon.

Over 600 members of the Univer-

sity community listened in on the 
Zoom call while submitting ques-
tions regarding off-campus student 
behavior, COVID-19 testing, quar-
antine plans and the endowment. 
The discussion was moderated by 
Faculty Senate Chair Colleen Con-
way, professor of music. 

Schlissel began the meeting by 

acknowledging the unprecedent-
ed challenges in addition to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including the 
economic instabilities brought on 
by the pandemic, renewed commit-
ment to anti-racism and the newest 
guidelines for international stu-
dents.

While an in-person teaching 

semester is ideal, Schlissel noted, 
there are risks with bringing stu-
dents back to campus, particularly 

for the more vulnerable faculty 
and staff. Schlissel said concerns 
with student behaviors off-campus 
could potentially be dangerous for 
those instructors who are more 
prone to severe illness.

“I’m very worried particularly 

about high-risk faculty and staff, 
and making sure that we can pro-
tect people that come to work to 
help teach our students and deliver 
our curriculum and fulfill our mis-
sion, particularly those that are 
under more than usual amounts of 
risk,” Schlissel said.

Despite these concerns, Schlissel 

also detailed some sources of opti-
mism in the midst of re-opening the 
University. He shared that out of 
the tens of thousands of students, 
only 49 students have tested posi-
tive for COVID-19. Michigan Medi-
cine workers who’ve served at the 
height of the pandemic have had 
little to no acquired infections.

“There’s a toolbox of public 

health interventions that if we 
can get a reasonable level of com-
pliance, we can make it through 
a semester and deliver that high 
quality of education that the Mich-
igan faculty and graduate instruc-
tors pride themselves on,” Schlissel 
said.

Collins also addressed how the 

University will approach decid-
ing which classes will be taught 
in-person versus remotely. Recog-
nizing that the structure of classes 
vary between disciplines and pro-

grams, Collins noted that the poli-
cies must follow a decentralized 
and consistent approach. Addition-
ally, the University will be focusing 
on incorporating self-identification 
surveys from faculty members and 
Graduate Student Instructors.

“To respect people’s privacy, we 

will ask instructors to self-identify 
in a number of broad categories, 
and not request medical documen-
tation or other written information, 
but a self-identification approach,” 
Collins said.

Faculty members who are 65 and 

older or who have conditions iden-
tified by the CDC as high risk for 
severe illness will not be expected 
to teach unless they prefer to, Col-
lins added. Additionally, accom-
modations will be made for faculty 
members and GSIs who self-identi-
fy into a number of categories such 
as concerns for other household 
members, childcare availability or 
any other reasons that instructors 
may have a strong preference to 
teach remotely. 

“We believe that this approach 

will enable us to accomplish our 
commitment to offering a high 
quality slate of in-person offer-
ings for students who are on cam-
pus as well as a slate for those who 
are remote while incorporating 
instructor 
preference,” 
Collins 

said.

D

ear McDonald’s: This Fourth 
of July, as a Black man, I have 
been forced to re-examine 
what it means to be a citizen of “The 
Greatest Country on Earth.” On one 
hand, we have been making progress 
with our national reckoning regard-
ing race, but we also have an embattled 
president whose mentality seems to be 
more fitting for 1920 than 2020. On the 
other hand, with our crippling wealth 
inequality and surging COVID-19 
caseload, it seems difficult to justify my 
knee-jerk embrace of American excep-
tionalism. As I pondered this over the 
previous weekend, I found myself 
increasingly reliant on the counsel 
of the most prolific distillation of the 
American Dream: F. Scott Fitzger-
ald’s “The Great Gatsby.”
This novel lays out a cohesive theory 
of the ideal American identity that, 
while paradoxical in many regards, is a 
roadmap for how we should behave and 
a cautionary tale for the potential pitfalls 
along the way. According to Fitzgerald, a 
great American is ambitious and entre-
preneurial yet also humble; he or she is 
a legendary, somewhat reclusive figure 
who allows an extensive myth to be 
constructed around them. Then, while 
I was flipping through chapter nine on 
July 5, my theory came into focus.
See, right now, no one person or 
group embodies the American ideal of 
Gatsby because of our deep divisions 
as Americans — we have been forced 
to take sides. You are either a Democrat 
or a Republican. You either spent the 
weekend excited to watch Hamilton 
with your friends over Zoom or lit fire-
works in the woods without masks. You 
are either excited for The Kissing Booth 

2 or have common sense. However, one 
thing we can all (arguably) agree on is our 
love for this country, and, by the end of 
this article, we will all agree that there is 
nothing more American than the McRib.
The birth of the McRib begins with 
the meeting of its two parents: Roger 
Mandigo and Rene Arend. As an emeri-
tus professor of animal science at the 
University of Nebraska and Meat Indus-
try Hall of Fame inductee, Mandigo 
invented the process of meat restructur-
ing: Producers take meat from animals, 
combine the different types of meat and 
form it into different shapes before being 
flash-frozen. Then, in response to the 
dual crises of Food and Drug Adminis-
tration warnings about beef consump-
tion and rising costs of chicken, Arend 
— whose previous fame was for making 
the three McNugget sauces: Hot Mustard, 
Sweet & Sour and Barbecue — used Man-
digo’s process to create the boneless pork 
patty, fashioned to look like a slab of ribs. 
Finally, in 1981, the McRib was unveiled 
to the world and began its journey into the 
hearts of millions of Americans.
Especially popular in the Midwest, 
the McRib immediately garnered a 
cult-like following from fans of the sand-
wich’s unique combination: a pork patty 
covered in an excessive amount of bar-
becue sauce, white onions and pickles. 
However, when McDonald’s celebrated 
its 30th anniversary in 1985, the com-
pany decided to pull the McRib from 
the menu because of assumed relatively 
little fanfare in response to rising pork 
prices and lagging sales, although the 
reasoning is explicitly undetermined. 
When the move was cruelly done with 
little to no warning, customers per-
ceived it as a direct affront, and decades 

later they began to organize negligible 
protests outside of McDonald’s restau-
rants nationwide, but the anger even-
tually faded as the company remained 
firm on not bringing back the item. 
Then, in what I can only assume was 
a response to Taylor Swift’s birth, the 
McRib was reintroduced as McDon-
ald’s first-ever limited-time-only item 
in 1989, becoming a menu mainstay 
once again in 1994. However, just like all 
good things, this was not meant to last as 
McDonald’s once again announced that 
the sandwich would be pulled from 
stores in 2005.
This decision once again faced 
backlash, prompting McDonald’s to 
announce the McRib’s “farewell tour,” 
which, much like the 2014 farewell 
tour of Motley Crue, lasted far too long 
until the general public forgot about it, 
and the sandwich made its “final” exit 
in 2007. While the McRib became a 
distant, if slightly pleasant, memory for 
most, it, much like Shrek and Bene the 
Breadstick, developed a cult following 
on the internet, as superfan Alan Klein 
founded a McRib locator website, dedi-
cated to finding regional locations that 
offered the fabled sandwich.
Thus, 13 years after the McRib has 
disappeared from the permanent 
McDonald’s menu, it has not disap-
peared from our hearts. In fact, upon 
its last nationwide release, the company 
attributed its 4.8 percent sales increase 
to the limited-time offering, which 
prompted me to write this letter.

America needs a McRib: an open letter to McDonald’s

L

ong before the COVID-19 
pandemic sent the American 
economy into a downward 
spiral, our nation had a serious problem 
with our national deficit. Now, after our 
federal government spent trillions of 
dollars in order to support American 
workers and businesses, our staggering 
national debt is more visible than ever.
According to the Committee for a 
Responsible Federal Budget — which 
projects the debt will grow by a total of $4 
trillion in the fiscal year 2020 — the federal 
debt now exceeds $26 trillion in the midst 
of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. This sharp 
increase in our national debt comes after 
Congress and President Donald Trump 
passed the CARES Act in March, which 
included stimulus checks, unemployment 
benefits and business support.
Now, with the CRFB and other 
experts predicting that more federal 
spending will be necessary to further 
prop up our damaged economy, Ameri-
cans face a national debt crisis at a new, 
dangerous level never seen before. While 
almost all economists agree this signifi-
cant government spending was necessary 
— and we shouldn’t hesitate to spend more 
in order to support households and busi-
nesses for the duration of the pandemic 
— we have a duty to remember the costs of 
our growing deficit at the same time.
Kenneth Rogoff, a professor at Har-
vard University and former chief econ-
omist at the International Monetary 
Fund, states, “I believe we are doing the 

right thing today by borrowing to make 
it through this tragic crisis, but make no 
mistake: It is not a free lunch, and it is 
not without its risks.” Speaking about 
the dangers of failing to manage the 
growing national debt, Rogoff added 
that in the presence of such a staggering 
deficit, it becomes extremely difficult for 
nations to spend in the midst of new crises 
and shocks. Additionally, he comments, 
“Many advanced countries are already 
likely to experience strains to help their 
populations, especially given the likely 
coming wave of corporate debt problems, 
and the need to protect banks.”
Most experts agree now is not the 
time to directly address the national 
debt crisis, when the track of the 
COVID-19 pandemic is so unpredict-
able. But once we are able to get the pan-
demic under control and this disease no 
longer poses a threat to our country, one 
of our top priorities must be addressing 
our crippling deficit.
Sadly, most issues and initiatives in 
our nation today are difficult to agree 
on, and bipartisan efforts are relatively 
rare. But everybody can agree that our 
national debt is dangerous and threatens 
the futures of all Americans. Sooner than 
later, we all will have to grapple with 
the impacts of this debt crisis.

A bipartisan solution to our debt

T

he passage of a repressive 
law by China has showcased 
their growing international 
influence and the weakening of the 
United States on the world stage. On 
June 30, China’s government passed 
a highly repressive national secu-
rity law aimed at cracking down on 
anti-government sentiment in Hong 
Kong. This law follows a year of mas-
sive anti-government demonstra-
tions against the growing control 
that mainland China is exerting over 
Hong Kong, which is supposed to be 
semi-autonomous.
The new Chinese security law 
comes with harsh penalties including 
possible life in prison for grave dam-
age of government buildings and 
terrorism charges for anyone who 
sabotages transport and causes 
significant damage to property. 
Within days of the law going into 
effect, pro-democracy books were 
being pulled off the shelves and a 
man was arrested for having a pro-
independence flag.
The law also allows for residents of 
Hong Kong to be extradited to main-
land China in certain cases, where 
they would face a secretive and non-
impartial legal system. This will 
occur if it is deemed a “national secu-
rity case” or a complex case — these 
broad definitions will likely allow 
the Chinese government to prosecute 
anti-government activists through 
sham trials in mainland China. This 
directly contrasts the current legal 
system in Hong Kong, which ensures 
a fair and transparent trial. 
Following the passage of this law, 
there was a vote at the United Nations 
Human Rights Council to condemn 
this law. The list of which countries 
voted not to condemn China was a 
disturbing reminder of the growing 
influence of China, especially in Asia 
and Africa. China has used its wealth 
to invest in developing nations. How-
ever, this investment does not come 
without strings. Over 40 of the coun-
tries that voted not to condemn the 
law have also signed onto China’s 
Belt and Road Infrastructure proj-
ect, in which China lends money to 
countries to build roads and ship-
ping infrastructure with the hopes of 
creating interconnected worldwide 
trade routes for Chinese use. 
China is known to lend money to 
developing countries, especially in 
Africa. In 2018, it was reported that 
20 percent of African governments’ 
external debt was owed to China. 
Many of these nations have been 
unable to repay their debts, especial-
ly during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This has led to fears that counties 

may feel more and more indebted to 
China and will be forced to support 
the country’s egregious policies. 
The growing international power 
of China, especially in Africa, has 
also been aided by the U.S.’s steady 
withdrawal from the international 
stage. Over the past few years, the 
Trump administration has promoted 
isolationist policies under the guise 
of America first. These policies range 
from slashing the United Nations 
budget to withdrawing from the 
Paris climate accord and instituting 
tariffs on our allies, including Can-
ada, Japan and the European Union. 
The Trump administration has 
also refused to be a leader at the Unit-
ed Nations. The U.S. is not a member 
of the UN Human Rights Council, 
which was the body that voted on the 
resolution to condemn China. The 
U.S., under orders from the Trump 
administration, 
withdrew 
from
the council after a disagreement 
about which other countries were 
allowed to join the council. While I 
admit that is absurd that countries 
such as Saudi Arabia are on this 
council, that does not mean that the
U.S. should have withdrawn. It is 
always better to have a seat at the 
table and use the power and influ-
ence of the U.S. to help advocate for
democratic values. 
The move towards isolation-
ism by the Trump administration 
has helped to create a vacuum that 
countries such as China and Rus-
sia are more than happy to fill. 
The growing sphere of influence 
of China and Russia in three devel-
oping countries is something that 
should concern all of us. 
The events of the past few months 
have put issues of justice, freedom 
and equality at the forefront of 
our national conversation. As we 
seek to emphasize these values, 
we must remember to look beyond 
our borders. Although these issues 
are oceans away from campus, we 
cannot turn a blind eye. The bla-
tant suppression of free speech and 
expression in Hong Kong is unac-
ceptable and must be opposed at 
all costs. We must also recognize 
the plight of countries that are los-
ing their autonomy to China. As we 
look to 2020, we must support can-
didates who understand the impor-
tance of international relations and 
recognize the power of the U.S. to 
use our influence to promote the 
values of freedom and democracy 
around the world.

China’s expanding sphere of influence

L

ate this past June, four years 
after defending its namesake 
in spite of backlash from 
student activists, the Princeton Uni-
versity School of Trustees voted to 
remove former U.S. President Wood-
row Wilson’s name from its Public 
Policy school. The decision-makers 
cited this “searing moment in Ameri-
can History” (i.e. the fallout from the 
George Floyd shooting) as a wakeup 
call to choose a better role model for 
Princeton students. While statues and 
other monuments of racist and con-
troversial American historical figures 
have been being removed for months 
now, this is one of the first times 
a United States president has had 
their memorialization eliminated. 
Wilson is considered to be a well-
regarded president among historians. 
In 2017, historians participating in 
C-SPAN’s presidential survey ranked 
him the 11th best president in U.S. his-
tory (President Barack Obama was 
12th). His accomplishments include: 
leading the U.S. to victory in WWI; 
agreeing to a suffrage amendment 
that led to Congress passing the 19th 
amendment granting women the 
right to vote; and playing a key role in 
establishing the League of Nations, 
one of the first intergovernmental 
organizations in the world. However, 
Wilson also, among other misdeeds, 
spoke “approvingly” of the KKK, 
further segregated the federal gov-
ernment and called D.W. Griffith’s 
incredibly racist film “The Birth of a 
Nation” “terribly true.” So was he also 
an unapologetic and dedicated racist? 
Quite certainly, but that does not nec-
essarily mean that we can’t honor him 
for his positive contributions to soci-
ety. When we consider the legacies 
of past Americans, we must first ask 
ourselves these two questions: Why 
are these people famous and does 
their claim to fame merit recognition 
despite their flaws?
Some of the historical figures at the 
forefront of the current statues and 
monuments debate are Confederate 
generals and political figures, such as 
Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, 
whose statues are scattered through-
out this country, particularly in the 
South. Regarding the first question, 
these people are famous for betraying 
their country and fighting for a slave-
owning rebel regime. Therefore the 
second question is moot, as their claim 
to fame is extremely undesirable in the 
first place. Every single one of these stat-
ues, military bases and other memori-
als to the Confederacy need to be taken 
down and/or replaced immediately as 
their values represent non-patriotic 
rhetoric and anti-Black agendas. 

However, remaining on the topic 
of the Civil War, not everyone during 
this time has such a clear-cut legacy. 
A statue of Union General and 18th 
U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant was 
recently taken down by protestors in 
Golden Gate Park in California. The 
protesters did so because Grant had 
owned a slave named William Jones. 
While this is true, Grant owned Jones 
only because he married into a family 
that owned slaves, and he emancipated 
Jones in 1859, the same year Jones may 
have been given to him by his wife’s 
family. Additionally, Grant is famous 
for leading the Union Army to victory 
in the Civil War, which allowed for the 
last slaves to be freed on July 19, which 
is now celebrated as Juneteenth. It is 
pretty safe to say that facilitating the 
widespread emancipation of millions 
of slaves greatly outweighs owning a 
single slave for less than a year before 
freeing him without any conditions. 
Back to Wilson, saying his accom-
plishments are formidable would be an 
understatement. His Fourteen Points, 
promulgated in a speech before Con-
gress that outlined his vision for ending 
WWI, were some of the most impor-
tant declarations in favor of free trade, 
national autonomy for Poland, Belgium 
and many other nations, as well as dip-
lomatic developments toward world 
peace such as the League of Nations. 
While the U.S. did not actually join the 
League of Nations, it is a widely accept-
ed fact that the League’s principle of 
international political cooperation (a 
principle strongly advocated for by 
Wilson at Versailles) was a major inspi-
ration behind the charter of today’s 
United Nations, of which the U.S. is an 
active member. Wilson not only voiced 
support for the 19th Amendment, but 
also fought tooth-and-nail for women’s 
suffrage for months in Congress while 
other legislators were convinced that 
allowing women to vote would harm 
their own electoral prospects. Toward 
the end of his term, Congress finally 
passed the 19th Amendment.
While he used to be opposed to 
female suffrage, Wilson quickly 
changed his views after recognizing 
women’s contributions to the WWI 
war effort and stated women abso-
lutely deserve to vote because they 
are capable of “service and sacrifice 
of every kind” for their country. Fur-
thermore, one should consider this: 
Abraham Lincoln was once against 
abolitionism, 
but, 
like 
Wilson, 
switched sides to a more progressive 
stance and freed the slaves with the 
Emancipation Proclamation. If that 
helped make him one of the great-
est presidents of all time, why can’t 
Wilson be given just as much credit 

for empowering women with voting 
rights? 
Woodrow Wilson has an extremely 
checkered and controversial legacy. 
After the recent decision, Princ-
eton President Christopher Eisgruber 
claimed that Wilson’s racism “disqual-
ifies” him from being a “role model” 
for Princeton students. However, 
it is not right to take his name away 
from a university solely because 
he was a bad role model in terms of 
race, because this ignores other areas 
where he can definitely be consid-
ered a role model, namely interna-
tional relations and women’s rights. 
Wilson’s solid contributions to public 
policy in those aforementioned areas 
build a strong case for his name to be 
on the public policy school of the uni-
versity where he was once president. 
It is also worth noting that the de 
jure segregation that Wilson helped 
implement is long gone due to legisla-
tion such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 
but the UN and female suffrage still 
remain among the pillars of democ-
racy and diplomacy today. Ameri-
cans need to fully recognize Wilson’s 
failures and injustices but also cele-
brate how he helped propel America 
into a more progressive future.
As previously stated, Wilson’s 
demise as the name for Princeton’s 
Public Policy School is simply one issue 
among many right now. Statues of 
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson 
and other giants of American history 
are also being defaced and torn down. 
However, in the words of Eugene Rob-
inson, acclaimed African-American 
Washington Post columnist, “there is 
an obvious difference between George 
Washington and Thomas Jefferson, 
who founded our union, and, say, Jeffer-
son Davis and Stonewall Jackson, who 
tried to destroy it.”
When we look at people like 
Presidents Jefferson, Washington 
and Wilson, we should absolutely 
acknowledge that these people were 
racist and Washington and Jeffer-
son were slave owners who played a 
large role in perpetuating the racially 
oppressive conditions that haunt 
Black Americans to this day. How-
ever, this should “temper our admi-
ration of them, not erase it entirely.” 
These people may have passed down 
to us a country plagued by slavery, Jim 
Crow and other problems, but they 
also created and protected the “con-
stitutional tools” that have allowed 
later Americans to make our country 
a better place for everyone to live. For 
that, they deserve to be recognized.

Which of our nation’s statues deserve to stay?

OPINION


Ever since my sister came home for her fresh-
man year Winter Break with a song called “Sat-
isfied,” “Hamilton” has been a part of my life. 
I met one of my closest friends because of it, I 
passed AP US History because of it and (sort of) 
passed AP Government because of it. I even got 
a chance to see the Chicago cast a few summers 
ago because of how much I loved it. As much as 
I loved that show, I knew it was nowhere near as 
incredible as the original cast’s show was. That 
same friend I mentioned before got to see the 
original cast’s show in New York and told me 
how amazing it was, and how much it meant to 
her to see the show with its creator Lin-Manuel 
Miranda in the starring role. So when I heard 
that Disney+ was going to be releasing the origi-
nal Broadway cast’s show, I was elated, posi-
tive that it would be one of the most incredible 
things I would ever see. I was right.
Getting to see the show from a couple hun-
dred rows away from the stage does not com-
pare to seeing the movie that Disney+ released. 
I got to see the heartbreak on Angelica’s (Renée 
Elise Goldsberry, “The Immortal Life of Henri-
etta Lacks”) face during “Satisfied,” the good-
natured teasing between Laurens (Anthony 
Ramos, “A Star is Born”), Mulligan (Okieriete 
Onaodowan, “The Super”), Lafayette (Daveed 
Diggs, “Wonder”) and Burr (Leslie Odom Jr., 
“Murder on the Orient Express”) in “Story of 
Tonight (Reprise),” the genuine tears rolling 
down Eliza’s (Phillipa Soo, “Here and Now”) 
face during “It’s Quiet Uptown …” The Disney+ 
film combines the best parts of a Broadway 
show with the intimacy of an at-home film. 
Seeing every carefully choreographed moment 
up close, while still having the audience reac-
tions of laughter and applause, makes the show 
a truly unique experience. If Broadway had a 
flaw, it would be that very few audience mem-
bers get the “perfect” view to see every detail 

that occurs onstage. The film removes that con-
cern, allowing any and every viewer to experi-
ence the show in the best way possible.
One might think that you can just listen to 
the “Hamilton” soundtrack and that would be 
enough, but that couldn’t be more wrong. The 
soundtrack doesn’t have Hercules Mulligan as 
Eliza’s and Alexander’s (Lin-Manuel Miranda, 
“Mary Poppins Returns”) flower girl, it doesn’t 
have Eliza’s heart-wrenching scream in “Stay 
Alive (Reprise)” and it doesn’t have the magic 
of a true Broadway show. Broadway is all about 
exaggeration; neither the soundtrack by itself 
nor a movie version of the show could capture 
what the actual Broadway performance does. 
However, you get live, in-time reactions from 
both the cast and the audience when you see 
the recorded performance of “Hamilton.”
But the real genius of “Hamilton” is that you 
learn something beyond the history of Alexan-
der Hamilton’s life when you watch it. Onstage, 
you see a version of America that we don’t have 
in real life. A version that we can work toward. 
There are women who vow to make “women 
a part of the [Declaration of Independence’s] 
sequel” in “The Schuyler Sisters,” there are 
people of color in positions of power — such as 
Christopher Jackson’s (“Bull”) George Wash-
ington — which is a step towards change (even 
if it isn’t enough) and there is a president who 
knows when it’s time to step down. It’s not a 
perfect America by any means; there is infi-
delity, murder and mourning. But it truly is a 
story of America’s history told by Americans 
today, as Lin-Manuel Miranda intended. The 
show has historical inaccuracies, to be sure, but 
those almost don’t matter in the grand scheme 
of things. You could read about the founding of 
America any time to get historical facts, but a 
textbook doesn’t provide hope for change the 
way that “Hamilton” does.

Gil Scott-Heron and 
‘60s campus politics

Before “The Revolution Will Not be Tele-
vised,” Gil Scott-Heron was a member of the 
Black & Blues. Following the summer of 1969, 
he returned to Lincoln University where he 
and fellow musician Brian Jackson worked on 
combining jazz arrangements with poetry. As 
members of the Black & Blues, they laid the 
foundation for their future work as a duo and 
solo artists. A lot of their work centered on the 
civil unrest and animosity Lincoln students 
had towards the university at the time. Given 
its small, rural setting, the intensity didn’t par-
allel those of other HBCU campuses like How-
ard University and Morgan State, but students 
with different beliefs directed their anger 
towards the conservative administration. And 
Scott-Heron was at the center of Lincoln’s pro-
test culture. 
Protests broke out on campus after a stu-
dent, Ron Colbert, died from an asthma attack. 
He was taken to the infirmary the night before 
when his inhaler wasn’t working, only for it to 
be closed. The administration denied respon-
sibility, erroneously claiming that Colbert died 
from marijuana use. Students’ rallied under 
demands for the institution to provide essen-
tial medical services. Scott-Heron gathered 
students at the school chapel the following 
morning and called for the student body to 
boycott classes. They rallied around demands 
he drew up for a 24/7 infirmary, a fully 
equipped ambulance and a replacement for 
the on-campus physician Dr. Davies. Colbert’s 
death was merely the tip of the iceberg. Several 
students had misdiagnoses from Dr. Davies, 
the infirmary wasn’t open around the clock 
and students were dying as a result of these 
limitations. After a week, the administration 
replaced Davies and Scott-Heron called the 
protests off. Things didn’t calm down on cam-
pus, though; students demanded the school’s 
president, Dr. Marvin Wachman, be replaced 
by a Black president. After students relentless-
ly pressured trustees, protested and circulated 
a petition, the administration named Herman 
Branson the first Black president of Lincoln 
University. The protests at Lincoln didn’t end 
though. Injustices towards Black Americans 
still endured on campus and beyond and stu-
dents refused to stay silent.
Scott-Heron had initially feared he couldn’t 
pursue music alongside activism. He found 
compromise in embedding his activism into 
his artwork. His writing often harkens back to 
his experiences at Lincoln. Following Lincoln’s 
administration for helping the FBI collect 
surveillance on its own students, Scott-Heron 
captured students’ collective rage in his poetry: 
“But something else was happening / and stu-

dents weren’t supposed to know / Lincoln’s 
state relationship included COIN-TEL-PRO / 
As now that you’ve got background and a / cer-
tain point of view / I’m awarding you a schol-
arship to go with me to Lincoln U.” The plot 
of his dystopian second novel, “The N***er 
Factory,” is centered around campuses turning 
young Black men into obedient members of 
bourgeois society. 
However, most notable in his work is his 
style of music. The basis is the work he did 
early on with Jackson, turning poems in spo-
ken word songs over Blues music. In many 
ways, this music became the basis for hip hop 
and rap music that would emerge in decades 
to come. No song has embodied this legacy 
better than “The Revolution Will Not Be Tele-
vised.” The title speaks for itself, but there’s 
often some confusion, in part because people 
misconstrue the nature of the medium. Why is 
it not enough to sit at home and watch cover-
age of protests on the television? Or “plug in, 
turn on and cop out” over social media and 
the internet? For one thing, you’re not really 
wary of the revolution if you’re not living it. No 
matter how “unbiased” the news touts itself 
to be, the content is curated and presented 
with many pieces of the story missing. This 
goes beyond the liberal or conservative slant 
of any particular media distributor. Rather, 
this results from both journalists’ and editors’ 
individual biases as well as the influence of a 
looming white supremacy, especially given an 
over three-quarters white U.S. workforce of 
newsroom employees.
There’s an obvious passivity to staring at 
a screen, and when people aren’t willing to 
engage in actions that lead to change, they 
don’t do anything to help any cause. The televi-
sion also exists for purposes that have nothing 
to do with the revolution. The song’s pop cul-
ture references illustrate this point: “[The rev-
olution] will not star Natalie Woods and Steve 
McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia” to “The 
theme song will not be written by Jim Webb 
or Francis Scott Keys.” These parallels to white 
American culture showcase the blithe, white 
lens of the television screen — how could any-
one expect anything different from the news it 
broadcasts? 
Gil Scott-Heron speaks from a first person 
point of view; he was very much a part of “the 
revolution,” from the protests he led on his col-
lege campus to the poems, songs and books he 
released throughout his career. In a video from 
1990 that recently made its rounds across the 
internet, he describes the revolution not as 
something people can see or talk about, but 
something they must experience:

FILM REVIEW
FILM REVIEW


In the imaginary world of “Rodham,” Hill-
ary Rodham writes of her relationship with 
Bill Clinton: “The margin between staying and 
leaving was so thin; really, it could have gone 
either way.” Although the novel is unquestion-
ably fiction, behind this invented statement 
there is truth: Bill Clinton famously proposed 
three times to Rodham, who, uncertain about 
their relationship, declined the first two. On 
the third proposal, she acquiesced, and they 
were wed in 1975.
In Curtis Sittenfeld’s version of the story, 
things go the other way. In 1975, Hillary Rod-
ham leaves Bill after his streak of infidelity and 
moves to Chicago to teach law.
This historical re-writing is the greatest 
selling point for “Rodham.” It’s a bold choice 
on Sittenfeld’s part, who was previously cel-
ebrated for her New Yorker short fiction and 
romance novels, not simply narrating from 
the perspective of political celebrity — Hill-
ary Clinton — but also reimagining that celeb-
rity’s life. Simultaneously, this ingenuity and 
slight awkwardness is what makes the novel 
so appealing to both Clinton’s political follow-
ers and more generic Democrats still aching 
from Clinton’s 2016 loss. It offers the potential 
to revel in a world — for 400 pages — where 
Clinton (or, Rodham?) was not marred by the 
sexual scandals of her husband, was not forced 
to change her last name for his political career 
and was not jostled into dresses as first lady.
From the onset, Sittenfeld finds Rodham’s 
voice with ease. It is rigid, straightforward and 
pragmatic, agreeing with the political accent 
and message heard by millions of Americans 
from debate stages and biographies. It is clear 
that Sittenfeld has done her research, and even 
when the story turns entirely unfamiliar (Rod-

ham’s thoughts towards Donald Trump, say, or 
even those during sex with Bill Clinton), she 
adheres to Rodham’s voice in such a way that 
makes it almost difficult to separate the person 
crafted in “Rodham” from the real former Sec-
retary of State.
Unfortunately, when this voice is utilized 
in the remainder of the novel, the potential 
strength that “Rodham” suggests in its intrep-
id premise is lost. Particularly in contrast with 
“You Think It, I’ll Say It,” Sittenfeld’s collection 
of short fiction that felt near-overwhelming 
with its brisk and thoughtful prose, the writing 
in large margins of “Rodham” feels disappoint-
ingly similar to your grandmother’s 99 cent 
paperback thriller. Sometimes, this comes in 
the form of tiring lines — “the speakers swelled 
with an upbeat pop song by a young female art-
ist.” Other times, particularly near the end of 
the novel, feel as if Sittenfeld is sick of sitting 
at her desk and has crammed six details into a 
sentence for the sake of, well, details.
The problem with this lackluster, unin-
spired writing is that it detracts from the areas 
in which “Rodham” has the potential to make 
excellent points. The book’s most powerful 
section is its first quarter, in which Rodham 
meets, falls in love with and eventually leaves 
Bill Clinton. “Falling in love was shocking, 
shocking, utterly shocking,” Sittenfeld writes. 
As the two move in together, Sittenfeld cap-
tures the moral complexity and distress that 
Bill’s infidelity invokes on Rodham. Like the 
rest of the novel, the chapters are intriguing 
and original. They also offer more than just an 
amusing tale about Rodham: They invoke com-
plex questions on love and relationships with-
out sacrificing writing or soapboxing about 
Rodham’s choices.

“If you are a marginalized person, most 
film and television is not made with you in 
mind,” Laverne Cox says about 20 minutes 
into Sam Feder’s new documentary, “Dis-
closure.” “If you are a person of color, an 
LGBTQ person, a person who’s an immi-
grant, if you’re a person with a disability, 
you develop a critical awareness because 
you understand that the images that you’re 
seeing are not your life.” 
This critical consciousness is what “Dis-
closure” aims to impart on its viewers. 
Through a thorough survey of on-screen 
depictions of transgender people, Feder 
captures a long history of scapegoating and 
misrepresentation. If the viewer was pre-
viously unaware of the pervasiveness of 
transphobia in cinema, Feder’s editing style 
quickly makes the viewer aware of it. Over a 
hundred films are included, most of which 
are presented without explicit commentary 
in clips of a few seconds. Small moments 
of transphobia abound in American cin-
ema, ranging from work by esteemed direc-
tors like Alfred Hitchcock to lesser-known 
pop-cultural specimens in talk shows and 
B-movies.
This whirlwind montage is interspersed 
with commentary by trans “creatives” — 
actors like Laverne Cox, Zackary Drucker 
and Jazzmun as well as filmmakers like 
Yance Ford and Lilly Wachowski — which 
serves to counterbalance the work by cis 
wirters and directors. These trans commen-
tators also offer insights on the role of rep-
resentation (good and bad) in shaping their 
own self-perceptions alongside the broader 
cultural consciousness. In one of the first 
sequences in the film, Laverne Cox unpacks 
the character of Geraldine in “The Flip Wil-
son Show,” which her mother would watch. 
“[She] would laugh at that character,” Cox 
says, which relegated anything trans to “the 
realm of humor.” 
Many of the other insights from the trans 
commentators work like this: on-screen 
representation doesn’t match up with the 
actual lived experiences and inner lives of 
trans people. For a trans viewer, this leads 
to cognitive dissonance or a feeling of being 
misunderstood. The actress and writer Jen 
Richards recounts a coworker asking her 
about Buffalo Bill (the transfeminine serial 
killer and necrophile from “Silence of the 
Lambs”) when she said she was going to 
transition. — “her only reference point was 
this disgusting, psychotic serial killer,” 
Richards says. “That was her only template 
for understanding … It hurts, it just hurts.” 
The critic Willow Catelyn Maclay notes 

in her review of the film that “Disclosure”’s 
“political consciousness is that of common 
sense or common decency.” As such, “Dis-
closure” focuses mostly on culturally domi-
nant portrayals of trans people that are 
shocking and violent. We see a geneology 
of the psychotic man-in-a-dress trope, that 
originates in Hitchcock’s “Psycho,” as well 
as the trope of the trans woman as murder 
victim in cop shows like “CSI” and “NYPD 
Blue.” Elsewhere, the film unpacks other 
tropes — transmasculinity as a packaging 
for women’s empowerment in films like 
“Yentl,” revulsion and violence at the reve-
lation of a trans woman’s body or history in 
films like “The Crying Game.” While more 
nuanced (if still problematic) films such as 
“Ma Vie En Rose” and “Breakfast On Pluto” 
are discussed, the scale is overwhelming-
ly tipped toward shocking, stereotypical 
depictions that circle around essentialism 
and violence. The trans commentators fre-
quently say of a clip that it’s “hard to watch.” 
This history is worth confronting, but 
is that all there is? Maclay aptly points out 
that representation is only one aspect of 
what can be considered “transgender” cin-
ema, and that “Disclosure” thus has a nar-
row scope. “Because the film mainly wants 
to offer an antidote to negative representa-
tion and analyze how these images of the 
past have informed modern perceptions of 
transness, there’s no room to address what 
transgender cinema may look like in the 
future,” she writes. The film only passingly 
touches on trans-made cinema (focusing on 
recent work by Lilly Wachowski and recent 
television like “Pose” and “Transparent”) 
and it feels as though a more thorough 
discussion of how trans people represent 
ourselves might have rounded out the film 
better. 
Even barring that, I wish the film was 
better at indicating what negative represen-
tation means. The commentators too often 
stop at calling transphobia what it is, which 
should be obvious to any remotely self-
aware cis person. Self-awareness doesn’t 
transform into a broader consciousness, 
and so the film can take on the tone of an 
HR-style sensitivity training. Why do cis 
people want all of this? The tropes “Disclo-
sure” discusses don’t point toward anything 
in the cis imagination that created them. 
Doing so would undermine the project of 
respectability the film is pursuing, one that 
assumes that “inclusion” in the system that 
created these images is the goal. It can’t 
help but be self-defeating.

The Siddi people, ‘India’s 
forgotten African tribe’

In harmonious 3/3 time, the feet 
of the Siddi people bounce up and 
down with vigor, excitement and 
passion. They’re dancing in a semi-
circle formation with movements 
slightly organized as a kora —an 
African-style drum — plays briskly, 
complementing their tempo. In 
a mix of song and chant, they let 
out words that are foreign to me, 
seemingly native to Africa — clear-
ly telling some sort of story. And 
according to the crowd, it was a 
captivating one at that. 
Six men dancing are adorned 
in a white shell necklace, a bright 
orange and black skirt and a grass-
covered belt. Their headbands 
matched the bottom — bright 
orange and black with mock horns 
extending from out the top. Deco-
rative face paint juxtaposes their 
skin, and the men move their lean 
bodies gracefully within their pack, 
displaying 
immaculate 
rhythm 
and practice, almost resemblant 
of antelope. Their movements 
are hypnotizing in a sense. Their 
movements exude sincere passion 
and incite a sort of magnetism, for-
bidding you remove your glance, 
and I can’t help but move my own 
body side to side a bit, entrapped by 
the group’s chant and song.
Over the six or seven trips I’ve 
taken to India in my life, I can’t 
recount a time I saw one Black per-
son; as I continue to educate myself 
on the Black Liberation Move-
ment worldwide, I questioned this. 
With a population of over 1.3 bil-
lion people hailing from various 

parts of the word, and in a place 
that shares cultural, geographic 
and religious similarities to several 
African countries, I felt inclined to 
research the history and state of 
Black lives in India today.
The Siddi people, “India’s for-
gotten African tribe,” are the 
notorious African Indians. It is 
estimated that the Siddis settled in 
India around 700 and 900 AD from 
Bantu or other Sub-Saharan tribes, 
enslaved by Indian rulers. How-
ever due to their physical strength, 
many were able to take up roles as 
soldiers in political warfare. An 
extremely famous Siddi, Malik 

Ambar, was known to be a great 
asset to the Maratha kings of India, 
introducing guerrilla warfare — 
previously used in Africa — to help 
defeat Mughals. As time passed, 
some Siddis bought freedom and 
some created their own commu-
nities in forests, often becoming 
entertainers, musicians and seers 
to survive. 
In the modern day, around 
55,000 Siddis live scattered across 
a few Indian states (Karnataka — 
where most are — Maharashtra, 
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat...

The most forgotten 
humanitarian crisis

The people of Yemen feel like 
the world has forgotten them, and 
with 80 percent of Yemen’s popula-
tion in need of humanitarian assis-
tance, it is a reasonable question to 
ask: “Has the world forgotten about 
Yemen?” However, for most, the 
more pressing question is, “what is 
even going on in Yemen?”
The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-
democracy protests and upris-
ings which spread across the Arab 
world in 2010, catalyzed Yemen’s 
fight for democracy, which pushed 
the former president of Yemen out 
of power and instated his deputy. 
The political transition exacer-
bated the low standard of living 
in Yemen, prompting a civil war 
to begin in 2015. The war quickly 
evolved from a fight for democracy 
to a proxy war, in which Saudi Ara-
bia and Iran are backing opposite 
sides, using Yemen as their play-
ground. Saudi Arabia is at fault for a 
military campaign which launched 
over 21,000 — and counting — air 
strikes on civilians and the creation 
of a coalition that is responsible for 
a land, sea and air barrier around 
Yemen, making it impossible for 
the Yemeni people to receive aid. 
Years of continuous air strikes, 
relentless weaponization of aid and 
innumerable violations of humani-
tarian laws have left Yemen in 
the worst humanitarian crisis the 
world has ever seen. As the war 
continues to destroy Yemen’s infra-
structure, the issues of massive 
unemployment, food insecurity 
and lack of health resources run

rampant, resulting in over 3 mil-
lion people internally displaced, 
approximately 20 million people 
hungry, 19 million people without 
access to clean drinking water and 
nearly 20 million without access 
to basic health services. For refer-
ence, Yemen’s population is just 
over 28 million; in other words, if 
you were to equate the situation 
in Yemen to the United States, 187 
million Americans would wake up 
hungry each day. As the war con-
tinues, these issues get worse, and 
bearing the brunt are the children, 
who are severely malnourished, 
without education — robbed of 
a bright future. The children of 
Yemen are at devastating odds with 
45 percent of children under the 
age of 5 having permanent mental 
or physical disabilities. 
As COVID-19 devastates devel-
oped countries, it hits Yemen, a 
war-torn country with the larg-
est humanitarian crisis, the hard-
est. With only five labs capable of 
testing for COVID-19, it is impos-
sible to know the true effect of the 
pandemic in Yemen. However, it is 
known that the population is dying 
at a higher rate than the rest of the 
world: 25 percent of people with 
COVID-19 in Yemen die, which is 
5.9 times higher than the global 
average. This should come with no 
surprise that a healthcare system 
destroyed by the war cannot sup-
port its people; there are two hos-
pital beds for every 7,000 people, 
only a few hundred ventilators and 
many hospitals closed in fear of 
contamination.

From one immigrant to another, 
We both know the fight for 
migrant rights has been a long bat-
tle against divisive laws and his-
torical injustices over-policing our 
immigrant lives. Our immigrant 
communities have faced injustice 
at the hands of those in power who 
value political rhetoric over the 
well-being of human lives. Ameri-
ca is a nation built on immigrants, 
yet, we immigrants are historically 
disregarded as second-class citi-
zens whose statuses are constantly 
threatened and whose identities 

are commonly exploited in various 
social institutions. 
Racial profiling, police abuse 
and discrimination are not com-
monalities exclusive to the immi-
grant community — they are fiercly 
prominent in the Black commu-
nity as well. The Black Liberation 
Movement and the fight for immi-
grant 
rights 
continuously 
run 
parallel and are currently both 
receiving great attention. From 
Emmett Till to George Floyd, we 
have seen the monstrous violence 
imposed on our Black brothers and 
sisters. This centuries-long racial 
inequity perpetuates all levels of 
social institutions including educa-

tion, the work-force, the criminal 
justice system, healthcare, hous-
ing and even food security. Current 
statistics show that Black Ameri-
can mothers are dying at 12 times 
the rate of white mothers during 
childbirth in NYC. This inequity 
is reflected in our law enforcement 
system where the extrajudicial kill-
ings of Black people at the hands 
of law enforcement has turned to 
American tradition. Police abuse 
extends to the immigration com-
munity through racial profiling.

No place like home: American 
housing insecurity

A significant part of the tradi-
tional American Dream includes 
buying your first house as a cumu-
lative result of hard work and 
steady income. For many people, a 
home is where you lay down roots, 
establish a family and a community. 
However, as a result of redlining — 
real estate discrimination and lim-
ited access to mortgages — there 
has been a large gap in homeown-
ership when comparing white fam-
ilies to Black, Hispanic and Asian 
family units. The rate of homeown-
ership among white communities 
in the first quarter of 2020 was 73.7 
percent — almost 10 percent higher 
than the whole country’s average of 
65.3 percent. Meanwhile, the rates 
for Black, Hispanic and Asian com-
munities were much lower: Black 
communities had 44 percent; His-
panic communities had 48.9 per-
cent; and Asian, Native, Hawaiian 
and Pacific Islander had 59.1 per-
cent. The effects of these dispari-
ties go far beyond home owning, as 
this ownership is often a gateway 
to wealth building through better 
public education, — for which the 
level of funding is determined by 
property taxes — tax benefits, etc. 
The homeownership gap has exist-
ed since the end of slavery but was 
only exacerbated by events such as 
the Great Depression and the 2008 
Housing Crisis. While homeown-
ership rates, in general, have risen, 
the gap among white people and 
Black and other POC has remained 
drastic. There are several reasons 
for this gap:

Real Estate Discrimination
Real estate discrimination can 
arise for many reasons and in many 
forms. Some of the major reasons 
include race, sexuality, disabilities, 
language barriers, gender or mari-
tal status. It is illegal to discrimi-
nate against a potential homebuyer 
for these reasons. Some common 
forms of discrimination include 
refusing to return phone calls, 
providing false information about 
the cost or availability of a unit or 
falsifying eligibility requirements. 
In numbers, 26 percent of Black 
people report having been treated 
differently due to their race dur-
ing the homebuying process, while 
Asian and Hispanic people report 
19 percent and 16 percent respec-
tively. Another extension of this is 
realtors are more likely to assume 
a higher income status for potential 
white homebuyers, whereas they 
are more likely to assume a lower 
income status for non-white poten-
tial homebuyers. A study conduct-
ed by a professor at Northwestern 

University produced data — which 
supported data from the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment — that stated in “about 
10% audits in which a white and 
an African-American auditor were 
sent to apply for the same unit after 
2005, the white auditor was recom-
mended more units than the Afri-
can-American auditor.” Similarly, 
“about 16% of Latinxs say they’ve 
been treated differently in their 
search for housing because of their 
race.” There are several other stud-
ies asserting similar claims: People 
of color are notably discriminated 
against when it comes to potential 
home ownership. Other studies 
include a Housing Discrimination 
Study in 2000 by the Office of 
Policy Development and Research, 
the Complexities and Process of 
Racial Housing Discrimination and 
Breaking Down the Black-White 
Homeownership Gap.

recognize is the same department

activism for countless of their own 
members, friends and family — 
those who identify as women.
The Department of Women’s 
Studies, founded in 1973, is built on 
the bedrock principles of coalition

Often I come across comments 
reading:
“Our laws aren’t racist… [and to 
gesture so] will do nothing to help

And then some more... 
“How can you say one of the

The legislation we uphold from

Everything you missed from a shortened softball season

Thursday, March 12, 2020 was 
what Michigan softball coach 
Carol Hutchins described as 
“the worst day of every coach’s 
career.” 
The 
day 
COVID-19 
brought the entire world of 
sports to a sudden stop. 
That 
was 
87 days ago. 
By now, the 
softball season 
would be over, 
the champions 
would 
have 
been crowned 
in 
Oklahoma 
City 
and 
someone 
would 
have 
carelessly asked Hutchins if she 
had any plans to retire after her 
37th season as the head coach of 
Michigan softball.
None 
of 
that 
actually 
happened. In its place, all we 
have are trends, hypotheticals 
and predictions based on just 23 
games.
The good news: That’s enough 
information to tell you all of the 
storylines and excitement you 
missed as a result of the abrupt 
and untimely end to the season.
Lexie 
Blair: 
Sophomore 
slump or slow start?
One of the most interesting 
early-season developments was 
sophomore 
outfielder 
Lexie 
Blair’s early hitting struggles. 
As a freshman, Blair posted a 
.406 batting average with 54 
RBI and 22 doubles. Entering 
her sophomore season, there 
were high expectations for Blair 
to perform at the elite level she 
established in 2019.
Blair herself held those same 
expectations.
“For me, in the beginning, 
I was just putting a lot of 
unnecessary 
weight 
on 
my 
shoulders,” Blair told The Daily 
in February. “Trying too hard 
not to disappoint the team 
after the (freshman) year I had. 
Trying to live up to expectations 
when really I just needed to get 
out and just play the game like I 
know how.”
Yet, in her first 13 games of 
2020, Blair was hitting at just 
a .175 clip and lost her leadoff 
spot, eventually sinking down to 
eighth in the lineup.
After 
her 
uncharacteristic 
start she made a phone call to a 
former teammate; whatever was 
said on that call appeared to help 

Blair regain her confidence.
Over the final 10 games of 
the season, Blair went 15 for 35, 
posting a .429 batting average. 
Those final 10 opponents were 
some of the best in softball 
including No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 
Washington, No. 3 Texas and 
No. 21 UCF. So not only was 
Blair trending upwards at an 
impressive rate, she was doing it 
against harder competition.
To say Blair would have ended 
at or above her .406 average from 
her freshman year had the 2020 
season been played in full would 
be a strong assertion, yet it was 
certainly possible considering 
Blair’s upward trajectory.
Now, Michigan will have to 
wait until the 2021 season to 
decide whether Blair is truly 
the star-studded slugger from 
her freshman campaign or the 
strong but streaky hitter she was 
as a sophomore.
Abby 
Skvarce: 
A 
true 
designated hitter
In softball, there’s a position 
titled “designated player,” which 
fills a slot in your lineup that 
can be used somewhat flexibly, 
but when your designated player 
holds the highest batting average, 
on base percentage and second 
highest 
slugging 
percentage 
among starters and bats cleanup, 
she should definitely be called 
your designated hitter.
Senior Abby Skvarce appeared 
in 37 at bats, which is more 
in a shortened season than in 
any of her previous three full 
seasons. And it’s pretty easy to 
see why Hutchins gave more 
nods to Skvarce this year than 
ever before — an on-base plus 
slugging 
percentage 
at 
.786 
tops all other starters while she 
knocked in seven runs, all on 
a team that struggled to find 
consistent offensive production.
Despite extended eligibility 
granted by the NCAA to spring 
athletes, Skvarce will not be 
returning in 2021. This means 
that after three years in the 
system 
and 
finally 
proving 
herself as a viable offensive 
contributor in her senior season, 
Skvarce is never going to suit 
up as a Wolverine again. And a 
COVID-inflicted season ensured 
we wouldn’t find out what 
Skvarce could really do with a 
full year as a starter.
Julia “Juju” Jimenez: The 
Future 
face 
of 
Michigan 

softball 
The 
freshman 
came 
in 
and 
did 
nothing 
short 
of 
impress. Jimenez, the No. 20 
overall prospect according to 
FloSoftball, 
walked 
into 
the 
building more than just ready to 
play — she was ready to start.
Offensively, she boasted 12 
runs, seven RBI, seven doubles 
and a .263 batting average. Sure, 
the numbers don’t jump off the 
page, but for a freshman batting 
leadoff, it’s nothing to scoff 
at. Not to mention, when Blair 
couldn’t find a rhythm, it was 
Jimenez who Hutchins turned to 
as the answer for the first spot in 
the batting order. 
“Juju didn’t make it any bigger 

than it was,” Hutchins told The 
Daily in February. “Which was, 
‘I’m batting.’ She doesn’t care 
when.”
That mentality is exactly what 
a team looks for in their batters 
— just bat.
But Jimenez moving into the 
spot of her upperclassmen wasn’t 
just in the batting order, it was 
also in the field. Just two games 
after being moved up into the 
leadoff spot, Jimenez shifted over 
from second base to shortstop. 
The previous shortstop, junior 
Natalia Rodriguez, who swapped 
positions with Jimenez, had held 
the starting position at shortstop 
for two years prior to the sudden 
mix-up.
Why? Hutchins never gave
a straight answer. But when 
commenting 
on 
Jimenez’s 
capabilities, she described them 
simply as “her swag on the field.”

With her freshman year cut 
short, we were unable to flesh 
out just how good Jimenez could 
be. One thing is for sure, though: 
Jimenez will see the field plenty 
over the course of the next 
three years. Jimenez’s dynamic 
fielding ability paired with her 
stoic hitting confidence is the 
perfect recipe for a star player 
that can anchor the Wolverines’ 
lineup, something they’ve been 
missing since Sierra Romero in 
2016.
The rest of the season: how 
far would Michigan have gone?
First, I need to acknowledge 
that with a 15-8 record, the 18th 
ranked 
Wolverines 
still 
had 
not played a single home game. 

In 2019, Michigan entered its 
home series at 12-10 en route to 
a 33-3 record down the stretch, 
including a 17-2 record at home. 
So, were the 2020 Wolverines 
poised to make a similar run? 
In short: yes.
The trend of winning in the 
latter half of the season is not 
uncommon for Michigan, and 
there’s a pretty simple explanation 
for why — besides ‘home field 
advantage,’ (which does help). 
The Big Ten, and other regionally 
close opponents, are simply not 
as good as the SEC, PAC-12 and 
other 
southern 
and 
western 
teams that the Wolverines face 
off against earlier in the season.
That’s not to say the Big Ten 
is a bad conference, there are 
certainly some contenders like 
Minnesota, 
Wisconsin 
and 
Northwestern that would give 
Michigan a run for its money. 

Even then, those teams weren’t 
performing as well as what may 
have been expected at the start 
of the season with only No. 22 
Wisconsin ranked.
Based on the first 23 games 
of the season, the Wolverines 
appeared to be the best team in 
the Big Ten. I believe they would 
have claimed the Big Ten regular 
season title for the second year 
in a row and had a chance to 
grab 
the 
repeat 
tournament 
championship trophy as well. 
In the tournament, the largest 
barrier 
would 
have 
been 
Wisconsin’s 
powerful 
offense 
containing Kayla Konwent and 
Stephanie Lombardo, somewhat 
of a mismatch to Michigan’s 

lower-scoring pace.
In the NCAA tournament, the 
Wolverines would have seeded 
well enough to host a regional in 
Ann Arbor. This year, I could see 
them getting past the first stage 
but likely falling in the super 
regional when the competition 
truly ramped up.
So no, COVID-19 did not 
prevent you from seeing another 
Michigan softball World Series 
run. What it did take away was a 
chance to gauge the trajectory of 
the team and the core players it 
has to build around in the coming 
years.
But like everything else right 
now because of the pandemic, 
those answers are unknown — so 
like everyone else, we’ll just have 
to wait.

Jim Harbaugh ‘never saw’ inappropriate 
conduct committed by Dr. Robert Anderson

Jim 
Harbaugh 
said 
he never saw, or heard, 
anything 
inappropriate 
surrounding Dr. Robert 
Anderson, 
the 
former 
University 
of 
Michigan 
doctor accused of sexual 
abuse by an ever-growing 
number 
of 
people, 
including 
ex-football 
players.
Anderson 
was 
the 
family doctor, Harbaugh 
said, as his father, Jack, 
was 
on 
the 
Michigan 
football 
coaching 
staff 
from 1973-79.
“Also when I played 
here 
at 
Michigan, 
Dr. 
Anderson was the team 
doctor,” Harbaugh said. 
“And took a physical for 
every youth sport that I 
played, and also when I 

was here in college for 
football, a yearly physical. 
Never saw, never anything 
inappropriate. Nor did I 
ever hear anything that 
was inappropriate about 
Dr. Anderson. 
“Never 
experienced 
anything 
inappropriate, 
never 
heard 
anytime 
where 
there 
was 
inappropriate (conduct) by 
Dr. Anderson.”
Anderson is alleged to 
have abused students and 
athletes during medical 
exams. Lawsuits filed by 
survivors 
are 
currently 
pending, as is a University 
investigation done by an 
outside firm, WilmerHale.
The University has said 
it wants to settle claims 
out of court, setting up a 
hotline number for victims 
to call with allegations.
Athletic director Warde 

Manuel has also come 
under fire for his handling 
of a complaint regarding 
the case, forwarding it to 
University lawyers instead 

of Title IX investigators.
In mid-June, Michigan 
reached out via email and 
the postal service to over 
300,000 
students 
who 

attended the University 
while Anderson worked 
there, asking alumni to 
report experiences with 
him.

“I am writing to ask 
you to come forward and 
speak to WilmerHale if 
you had any experience 
with Anderson you wish 
to report or if you have 
any 
other 
information 
you 
believe 
may 
be 
relevant,” 
University 
President Mark Schlissel 
wrote. 
“Safeguarding 
the 
confidentiality 
of 
Dr. 
Anderson’s 
former 
patients is of paramount 
importance. Accordingly, 
WilmerHale 
will 
not 
disclose any identifying 
or 
confidential 
patient 
information 
to 
the 
University, and the identity 
and 
confidentiality 
of 
Dr. Anderson’s patients 
will be protected from 
disclosure to others to the 
fullest extent permitted 
by law.

Contract extension discussions for Harbaugh 
tabled as a result of COVID-19 pandemic

There’s 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
a 
contract 
extension 
won’t 
come 

for Jim Harbaugh. And, 
according to the Michigan 
football 
coach, 
before 
the 
pandemic 
turned 
everything upside down, 
one was “right there.” 

“Right in last February, 
it was being discussed, and 
then the pandemic hit,” 
Harbaugh said on a Zoom 
call with reporters. “And 
it’s been not as high on the 

priority list.”
Harbaugh’s 
current 
contract, which runs until 
the end of the 2021 season, 
would see him paid $8.05 
million this year if not for 
a 10 percent pay cut agreed 
to due to the financial 
deficit facing the athletic 
department.
There’s little reason to 
think Michigan wouldn’t 
want to retain Harbaugh. 
Though he hasn’t taken 
the 
Wolverines 
to 
a 
College 
Football 
Playoff 
or 
beaten 
Ohio 
State, 
Harbaugh 
has 
piloted 
the football program to 
three 
10-win 
seasons 
after it hit an extreme low 
point under Brady Hoke. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
2021 
recruiting class is also 
eighth in the country, per 
247Sports, after a slew of 
commitments over the last 
few months.

As for his potential to 
move jobs, Harbaugh has 
consistently 
shot 
down 
rumors of going back to 
the NFL, going as far to 
send a letter to parents of 

Michigan football players 
last season to refute a 
report that he was planning 
to leave.
For his part, Harbaugh 
seems 
content 
with 
the 
current 
situation, 
understanding
the 
financial constraints that 
Michigan 
is 
currently 

under. 
There’s 
also 
the 
obvious reality for both 
him and the University 
that a massive contract 
extension for a football 
coach amid a pandemic 
that’s seen the athletic 
department project a $26.1 
million deficit, when no 
one knows whether there 
will be football played in 
September, would be poor 
optics at best and tone deaf 
at worst.
“I 
think 
there’s 
bigger fish to fry for our 
athletic director, for our 
administration, for, really, 
me as a coach,” Harbaugh 
said. “It hasn’t been on the 
top of the priority list. But 
I would expect something. 
That 
would 
be 
an 
announcement at sometime 
when that is said. I’m under 
contract this year and next. 
So we’ll get to that.”

Harbaugh optimistic 
about fall sports season

When 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
sat 

down in front of his computer 
Wednesday afternoon for his first 
press conference of 2020, he knew 
the looming question would be 
one he’s never faced during his 
16-year head coaching career.

Normally around this time, he 

would be joining the Big Ten’s 13 
other head coaches in Chicago to 
talk about quarterback battles, 
how the freshmen look and who’s 
in the best shape of their lives. 
This year, of course, isn’t normal. 
There are no Big Ten media 
days and come early September, 
there may not even be a season 
— an ever-growing possibility as 
COVID-19 cases escalate across 
the country.

But with that scheduled start of 

the season just over eight weeks 
away and 50,304 new coronavirus 
cases confirmed in the US on 
Tuesday, Harbaugh re-affirmed 
his hope for the season to unfold 
as planned.

“If students are on campus, 

then my personal belief as a 
parent of a daughter who would 
also be on campus is that this is 
a safe place,” Harbaugh said. “As 
safe as possible, would be within 
the University, in our athletic 
buildings and complexes. The 
safety precautions that have been 
put into place, I would feel good 
with the medical oversight of 
the students, student athletes. I 
would want the responsibility.”

Harbaugh acknowledged the 

importance of that caveat — if 
students are on campus — saying 
“it’s a different conversation if 
there’s no students on campus.” 
This week, it’s an especially 
relevant caveat with Rutgers 
becoming the first Big Ten school 
to announce its classes will be 
almost entirely online in the fall. 
And with new cases on the rise 
in every Big Ten state, the Scarlet 
Knights could just be the first 
domino to fall.

For now, though, Michigan 

and most teams on its planned 
12-game schedule are holding 
firm on plans to hold at least some 
classes in person. And if that’s the 
case, Harbaugh wants football to 
follow, issuing the controversial 

and now viral statement that 
“COVID is part of our society. 
Wasn’t caused by football or 
caused by sports. And there’s no 
expert view right now that I’m 
aware of that sports is going to 
make that worse. It’s part of our 
society, we’re going to have to deal 
with it.”

Of course, the virus wasn’t 

caused by football — a truth 
that doesn’t negate the dangers 
of hundreds of college athletes 
congregating each day and then 
returning to their communities, 
unlike professional athletes in 
leagues that plan to resume their 
seasons in isolated bubbles.

Harbaugh, though, isn’t an 

epidemiologist. His focus isn’t on 
viral diseases, it’s on his team and 
his players. 

“I share the same opinion as our 

players,” Harbaugh said. “They 
want to play. As I said, they’ve 
been training their whole lives 
for this and these opportunities. 
Put the question to them, which I 
have, they would rather play than 
not play.”

That single-minded focus is 

why Harbaugh remained mum on 
the possibility of a spring season. 
It’s why, when asked about the 
likelihood of playing Washington 
in Seattle on Sept. 5, he said, “Not 
gonna offer my personal opinion. 
Athletic 
directors, 
presidents, 

school presidents and the medical 
experts can decide what’s best 
there.” 
A 
notably 
different 

approach than what he took when 
asked of the virus as a whole.

But what he is doing is making 

sure his players are doing what 
they can: wearing masks and 
following 
social 
distancing 

protocols put in place by health 
officials and athletic department 
specialists. “They’ve been really 
great about following those,” 
Harbaugh said. “I think they 
really understand there’s great 
value 
to 
keeping 
their 
own 

personal health but that of their 
teammates.”

The point of all that? To get to 

Harbaugh’s ultimate goal: have a 
season.

“The scenario that they’re 

playing is the one that you’re 
hoping and praying for,” Harbaugh 
said. “These youngsters have put 
in a lot of training, really their 
whole lives, for these moments.”

Coach Jim Harbaugh sparked fierce reactions with his comments on COVID-19.

THEO MACKIE

FOOTBALL

Jim 

Harbaugh 
went 
viral 

on 
Twitter 

Wednesday. 

“Michigan 

head 
coach 

Jim Harbaugh 
doesn’t think 
playing sports 
will 
make 

the 
COVID-

19 outbreak worse,” screamed the 
Twitter moment.

“COVID is part of our society,” 

he said in a Zoom call with media 
earlier in the day. “Wasn’t caused 
by football or caused by sports. And 
there’s no expert view right now 
that I’m aware of that sports is going 
to make that worse. It’s part of our 
society, we’re going to have to deal 
with it.”

The uproar was predictable.
Except, well, that wasn’t really 

what he said. At least, it wasn’t all of 
what he said. Or even close to all of 
what he said. Here’s all of what he 
said:

“Yeah, my thoughts would be, it’s 

a different conversation if there’s no 
students on campus. If students are 
on campus, then my personal belief 
as a parent of a daughter who would 
also be on campus that this is a safe 
place. As safe as possible, would 
be within the University, in our 
athletic buildings and complexes. 
That safety precautions that have 
been put into place.

“I would feel good with the 

medical oversight of the students, 
student athletes. I would want 
the responsibility. I would want 
the responsibility of keeping our 
players safe and also educating 

them. I would not want to come off 
of that guard tower of educating 
and keeping our players safe.

“Now, if it comes to a point in 

time where you say that we can’t 
play, it’s obvious, it’s clear, then 
everybody would be reasonable and 
know that was the right thing to do. 
COVID is part of our society. Wasn’t 
caused by football or caused by 
sports. And there’s no expert view 
right now that I’m aware of that 
sports is going to make that worse. 
It’s part of our society, we’re going 
to have to deal with it.

“These kids are going to have to do 

the same thing. They’ve got to go to 
school. They’ve trained their whole 
lives for the opportunity to play 
their sport. That is my view with the 
knowledge that we have and time to 
learn more about it. It would be my 
responsibility, our responsibility 
and the players’ responsibility also, 
to keep themselves safe and get the 
schooling and training that they 
need.”

That doesn’t sound like a football 

coach putting himself ahead of 
unpaid kids so he can make money 
amid a pandemic. 

It sounds like someone who’s 

spent the last four months talking 
every day to people about whether 
or not a football season will happen 
and if so, how it can happen. It 
sounds like the parent of an athlete 
(as well as another student) at the 
University — cautious, but willing 
to go along with the plan in place. 
It sounds like that because that’s 
exactly what it is.

I’m tired of this song and dance 

we do every time Harbaugh gives 
his actual opinion on something. 
Frankly, it makes me understand 
why he often goes out of his way 
to not say anything interesting. It’s 
exhausting.

That’s not to say he should get 

a free pass to say whatever he 
wants. If you want to rip Harbaugh 
for suggesting football might be 
possible, that’s fine. Football might 
well not be possible. I don’t know 
and neither does he. But criticize in 
context.

He noted the importance of 

students being on campus, which 
University President Mark Schissel 
and 
Athletic 
Director 
Warde 

Manuel have said is a must if football 
is to happen. Harbaugh noted the 
safety precautions in place, both 
in athletic buildings and the rest 
of the University, and it’s clear that 
if Michigan’s reopening plan fails, 
it will almost certainly be due to 
behavior that happens outside the 
purview of those guidelines. 

He’s probably wrong in saying 

no expert thinks sports will make 
it worse …. but an epidemiologist 
told The Athletic the risk is hard 
to quantify if students are already 
on campus, and might be mitigated 
by extra testing. So at minimum, 
there’s certainly no consensus 
over whether sports would make it 
worse.

“Jim Harbaugh doesn’t think 

playing sports will make the 
COVID-19 
outbreak 
worse,” 

obviously sounds a lot better than, 
“Jim Harbaugh is optimistic that 
football season can happen safely if 
players and coaches follow extensive 
safety protocols that will be in place 
if universities allow students back 
for in-person learning.” Maybe that 
better explains the issue than the 
last 700 words of this column.

Here’s the thing, though. If 

doctors and epidemiologists tell 
him it isn’t safe, Harbaugh won’t 
marshal 130 players and staff onto 
a plane to Seattle so Michigan can 
play Washington on Sept. 5. One 
source told The Daily that game is 
highly unlikely to happen, which 
comports with, well, basic logic. 
Though he won’t say it publicly, 
Harbaugh surely knows that, too.

While Twitter was ripping him to 

shreds, here’s what else Harbaugh 
said about the novel coronavirus 
and how it’s affecting his team:

“I’d say the biggest question 

I’m really getting from our players 
is how they can be a part of the 
solution. A lot of the feedback has 
been that their peers, other people 
in their age group, are somewhat 
or very cavalier about the virus. 
How it affects that age group. Their 
response has been they want to be
