Coleman: 'U'
tuition levels
likely to rise
next year

University students and Olympic ice dancers Meryl Davis and Charlie White pose in the Law Quad last month before traveling to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics,
where the pair earned a silver medal. University students Emily Samuelson and Evan Bates also competed in ice dancing at the Vancouver games.

Officials looking for
solutions to close
expected $68M state
funding shortfall
By YLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
LIVONIA, Mich. - In an inter-
view following her testimony to
the State Senate Subcommittee
on Higher Education on Mon-
day, University President Mary
Sue Coleman discussed ways the
University might cope with an
expected drop in state funding
- including possibly increasing
tuition levels.
Coleman acknowledged that
the $22 million in cost-cutting
measures she referenced in her
testimony - which include infor-
mation technology consolidation
and cost sharing on employee
health benefits - will not fully
cover the expected $68 million
cut next year in state appropria-
tions to the University.
"It'll be a combination I think
of looking at tuition revenue,
looking at alternative offerings
we could have in the spring and
the summer," Coleman said.
"There might be slightchanges
in the residency next year," she

said, referring to the composi-
tion of in-state and out-of-state
students enrolled at the Univer-
sity. However, Coleman said the
change, if any, would be very
minimal.
Coleman said that becausethe
University was expecting cuts in
state appropriations, University
officials began budgeting in such
a way that the University would
absorb the cuts over three years
instead of taking the hit all at
once.
"In our three-year model ...
we wanted to let students know
about planning for more regular
and modest tuition increases,"
Coleman said. "We're not talking
about 10 percent, we're talking
about less than that."
Last year and the year before
tuition increased by 5.6 percent.
Tuition increased by 7.4 percent
in the 2007-2008 academic year
and by 5.5 percent the 2006-2007
academic year.
Coleman said she wouldn't
rule out the possibility of asimi-
lar tuition increase next year.
However, she said, there are still
too many variables to pinpoint
what tuition increase students
may see next year.
"I don't know what we're going,
to do yet so I don't want (peo-
ple) to sort of think that that's

Meryl Davis and
Charlie White won
silver in Vancouver

By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily News Editor
It's not every day that University
President Mary Sue Coleman calls
students on their cell phones.
- But after University students
and ice dancers Charlie White and

Meryl Davis won silver medals in
the 2010 Olympic Winter Games
last month, Coleman did just that.
"I was just listening to my voice-
qpails after the free dance, and I
came upon one that said, 'Oh, hi
Meryl this is Mary Sue Coleman,'
and I was a little shocked but very
excited and honored," Davis said in
an interview last week.
Coleman wasn't the only one
on campus rooting for Davis and
White. Thousands of students
watched the pair perform on tele-

vision and offered support through
emails, texts and Facebook status-
es. Davis said she even got e-mails
of encouragement from professors
she had during her freshman year.
And the support didn't stop at
students and professors. Before the
pair took off for Vancouver, Michi-
gan hockey coach Red Berenson,
Michigan men's basketball coach
John Beilein and Michigan foot-
ball coach Rich Rodriguez signed
a large University of Michigan flag
and gave it to Davis and White to

take to the games for good luck.
In Vancouver, Davis and White
scored a 215.74 across their three
dances - falling a few points shy of
Canadian ice dancers Tessa Virtue
and Scott Moir, who won the gold
with a total score of 221.57 points.
In an interview after return-
ing from the Olympics, Davis and
White said that all the support they
received throughout their career
was a big part of the reason they
skated so well at the games.

UCLA students rally against cuts, hikes

u Â°
_, ., '
_

Hundreds of students and staff at
the University of California, Los Ange-
les rallied in support of public educa-
tion in California during the National
Day of Action on March 4, according
to an article in the Daily Bruin, the
University of California, Los Angeles'
campus newspaper.
According to the article, the activ-
ists - who chanted "Education should
be free - no cuts, no fees" - protested
education budget cuts as well as inci-
dents of racial discrimination that
have allegedly occurred at multiple
University of California campuses.
UCLA spokesman Phil Hampton
said in the article that university offi-
ials have accepted a list of student
demands but that no changes could be
promised.
"I think that, like students, UCLA
campus leaders are concerned about
the rising cost of education," Hampton
said in the article. "We are committed
... to finding cost savings and preserv-
ing the high quality of education."

MSU BANS USE OF LIVE ANIMALS
IN VET SCHOOL TRAINING
Michigan State University will stop
using live animals when training stu-
dents in its College of Veterinary Medi-
cine to perform surgeries, The State
News reported in an article published on
March 4.
MSU officials announced the ban last
week and said the school will start using
animal cadavers in the fall, according to
the article.
Currently, the college buys animals
that are bred for scientific purposes. Dur-
ing surgeries, the animals, mostly dogs,
are placed under anesthesia and then
euthanized.
Bryden Stanley, an assistant professor
of small animal clinical practices at MSU,
told the State News that the school has
been looking into ways to teach surgeries
that don't involve live animals for a few
years. He said the cadavers will provide
the same learning experience as live ani-
mals.
"It will be skill-based, and they will

have practiced so manytimes, when they
do come to the live animal, they will be
better prepared," Stanley said in the
article.
TEXAS UNIVERSITY GROUP
TRADESPORNFORBIBLES
Atheist Agenda, a student group at
the University of Texas at San Antonio,
led a drive to exchange pornography for
religious texts, according to a March 2
article in the Paisano Online.
In its "Smut for Smut" campaign on
March 1, the group exchanged copies of
Playboy and Penthouse magazines for
Bibles, Torahs and Korans.
According to the article, a group of
Christian students protesting the cam-
paign deterred students from participat-
ing in the exchange.
UTSA sophomore Cecilia Tapia was
among the protesters who carried signs
that said "Jesus Saves" and "Jesus loves
the Atheist Agenda."
"I'm here to make sure they know the
word of God," Tapia said in the article.

COMMERCE, Texas
Gunman shot
outside Walmart
A man walked into a Walmart
in Texas carrying at least two
guns before engaging in a shoot-
out with police outside the store,
authorities said. The man was
killed and an. off-duty officer in
the store who had tried to stop
him was Injured.
The incident in the east Texas
city of Commerce began when
police received a call of shots
being fired from a car in nearby
Greenville, about 50 miles north-
east of Dallas, said City of Com-
merce spokeswoman Marty
Cunningham.
Commerce police intercepted
the car just outside the city limits,
where the man exchanged gun-
fire with officers, Cunningham
said. He then drove to Walmart
and entered the store "carrying a
long gun and pistol," the spokes-
woman said.
PITTSBURGH
Student found dead
in frat house at
* Caregie Mellon
A man who had been celebrat-

and socializing was found dead
yesterday in a Carnegie Mellon
University fraternity house, police
said.
The 22-year-old man "likely
drank too much" while celebrating
Saturday night, police Detective
Christine Williams said.
The man, whose identity wasn't
disclosed because his parents
hadn't been notified, was found
yesterday afternoon by one of
the friend's roommates at the Pi
Kappa Alpha house, police said.
He was a student at the University
of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, about
30 miles southeast of Carnegie
Mellon.
His cause of death hasn't been
determined.
WASH INGTON
Obama urged to t
change position on
terrorist trials
A Republican senator is offering
the White House a deal on terror
trials.
Sen. Lindsey Graham says that if
the president agrees to try alleged
Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheik
Mohammed and four accused
henchmen in military tribunals,
he will press fellow Republicans to
vote to close the Guantanamo Bay
prison.
Graham, interviewed yester-
day on CBS' "Face the Nation,"
says reversing Attorney Gen-
eral Eric Holder's plan to try the
suspected terrorists in a civilian
court in New York City would be
seen as an act of leadership by the
public.
The White House is reviewing
Holder's plan and no new recom-
mendation has been presented to
the president. A decision is not
expected for several weeks.
Beyond Mohammed's case,
Graham also said a new legal
framework is needed to deal with

the most dangerous detainees at
Guantanamo.
10S, Nigeria
200 slaughtered in
religious conflict
Rioters armed with machetes
slaughtered more than 200 people
overnight yesterday as religious
violence flared anew between
Christians and Muslims in central
Nigeria, witnesses said. Hundreds
of people fled their homes, fearing
reprisal attacks.
The bodies of the dead - includ-
ing many women and children -
lined dusty streets in three mostly
Christian villages south of the
regional capital of Jos, local jour-
nalists and a civif rights group said.
They said at least 200 bodies had
been counted by yesterday after-
noon. ._
Torched homes smoldered after
the 3 a.m. attacks that a region-
wide curfew enforced by the coun-
try's police and military should
have stopped.
The killings represent the lat-
est religious violence in an area
once known as Nigeria's top tour-
ist destination, adding to the tally
of thousands already killed in the
last decade in the name of reli-
gious and political ambitions.

Soldiers arrest a looter at a market in Hualpen, near Concepcion, Chile, on Tuesday. Troops enforce a curfew in this earthquAke-
stricken coastal region after looters rampage through stores.
Chilean pol ce force
looters to return goods

Poll shows 85 percent
of Chileans want
looters prosecuted
CONCEPCION, Chile (AP) -
The officers came with bullhorns
to impoverished neighborhoods
near the epicenter of Chile's dev-
astating earthquake, warning
looters to return what they stole
or face police raids.
And so they did, depositing
everything from mattresses to
refrigerators and flat-screen TVs.
It took 35 truckloads to recover
it all. Together with looted mer-
chandise recovered by police, the
material is worth nearly $2 mil-
lion, officers said.
Touring a police gymnasium
full of the recovered goods yes-
terday, President Michelle Bach-
elet called the looting one of
"the other aftershocks of this
tragic earthquake," and vowed
that those responsible would feel
the full weight of the law: prison
terms of two to five years.
"These are items that have
nothing to do with survival -
they reflect the moral damage of
the people, some of whom came
just to find things they could
make money from," she said, add-

ing that the government also will
prosecute anyone responsible for
price speculation in the disaster
area.
Thousands of quake survivors
participated in the looting, which
began only hours after the dev-
astating earthquake and grew to
include grandmothers and small
children. Outnumbered police
could only stand and watch,
urging people to take only the
food they needed, until soldiers
arrived and restored order.
The looting hampered rescue
and recovery efforts by distract-
ing firefighters and police and
deeply wounded the national
pride of Chileans who yearn to be
considered part of the first world.
"The damage it caused (to
Chile's international image) is
lamentable. Now they'll throw
all of us in the same bag," said
Juan Lagos.Rosales, a construc-
tion worker forced to sleep in
a tent with his wife and infant
daughter outside their fallen
house.
Some excuse the looting as
a natural result of the yawning
wealth gap in Chile, where the
poor are exposed to expensive
consumer goods without any
ability to buy them. The top 20
percent of wage earners make an

average of $3,200 a month, com-
pared to $340 a month for the
bottom 20 percent, according to
the national statistics institute.
When the earthquake shat-
tered store windows, the temp-
tation was too great, said father
Luis Figueroa Vinet, a deacon
at Concepcion's main cathedral.
"The pig isn't guilty for what pov-
erty brings," he said, invoking
a colorful Chilean adage about
inequality. '
But a poll yesterday suggests 85
percent of Chileans want the loot-
ers prosecuted - a view shared
by city worker Aran Fuentes, who
said the looting let all Chileans
down: "After all that we've done
for other countries, to present
ourselves to the rest of the world
as looters really hurts."
Police Lt. Oscar Llanten cred-
ited the return of more than
950 items to teamwork between
police and members of the looters'
own communities, who tipped off
officers. The items included doz-
ens of stoves, refrigerators, soft
chairs and sofas, now-soiled mat-
tresses, bicycles, plastic toys, tele-
visions and a copying machine.
Many Chileans squarely blame
Bachelet for failing to stop the
looting before it spread through-
out the disaster area.

Insurgents kill 36 in
attacks aimed at
voters, polling places
BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraqis defied
insurgents who lobbed hand gre-
nades at voters and bombed a
polling station yesterday in an
attempt to intimidate those tak-
ing part in elections that will
determine whether their coun-
try can overcome deep sectarian
divides as U.S. forces prepare to
leave.
The conclusion of the vote,
however, did not spell an immedi-
ate end to political uncertainty. It
could be days until results cdme in
and with the fractured nature of
Iraqi politics, it could take months
to form a government.
Sunnis and Shiites seemed
united in one way yesterday -
defiance in the face of violence.
Many came out of polling booths
waving fingers dipped in purple
ink in a now-iconic image syn-
onymous with Iraq's democracy.
In one Baghdad neighborhood,
relatives who had just lost a fam-
ily member in a bombing walked
down to the polling booth to vote.
The violence was a direct chal-
lenge to Prime Minister Nouri al-
Maliki who has gained popularity
as violence across the country has
plummeted.
"I voted for Nouri al-Maliki
because I trust him as a man who
succeeded in getting rid of mili-
tias and building a strong state,"
said Saadi Mahdi, a 43-year old
engineer in the southern oil city
of Basra. It was there that al-
Maliki first established himself
as a leader willing to go against
his fellow Shiites when he routed
militias aligned with anti-Ameri-
can cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.
It was an election day that
demonstrated starkly how far the
country, a rare democracy in the
Middle East, has come since the
last nationwide parliamentary
vote in December 2005 and how
much still holds it back.
Instead of unified sectarian
parties playing strictly to their
Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish vot-
ers, the political blocs contest-
ing the election were much more
fractured and made at least some
effort to cross over into other
sects. Whereas only party names
were known in the 2005 ballot
- in order to protect candidates
from assassination - this time
cities were plastered with candi-
dates' faces on posters as Iraqis
voted for individual people.
And the American military
presence so prominent in 2005
was limited on election day to
helicopters buzzing over head as a
massive deployment of Iraqi forc-
es took the lead on the ground.
Still the violence that shook
Baghdad served as a reminder of
the insurgency's persistence and
adaptability.
Insurgents used mostly rock-
ets, mortars and explosive-filled
plastic bottles hidden under trash
to terrorize voters on their way to

the polls. With those tactics, they
managed to get around a vehicle
ban in place across the capital for
most of the day and killed 36 peo-
ple, almost all of them in Baghdad.
Al-Maliki faced a double chal-
lenge at the polls. Al-Sadr has
aligned with another Shiite reli-
gious party - the Supreme Islam-
ic Iraqi Council - to seek the
prime minister's job. On the other
side, al-Maliki is beingchallenged
by former Prime Minister Ayad
Allawi, a secular Shiite, whose
nonsectarian stance and criticism
of the current government has
won him secular Shiite followers
as well as Sunni supporters.
"They symbolize the unity
of Iraq," Hasan Ai, a Sunni
Turkoman, in the northern city
of Tal Afar, in Ninevah province,
who voted forAllawi's Iraqiyaalli-
ance. "It will bring us together."
No one coalition is expected to
win an outright majority in the
325-seat parliament so the coali-
tion that gets the largest num-
ber of votes will be tasked with
cobbling together a government
with other partners - possibly a
tough task for al-Maliki who has
angered parties across the politi-
cal spectrum during his nearly
four years in office. But in Iraq's
freewheeling democracy, no one
believes that any political align-
ment is off the negotiating table.
The two Kurdish parties,
known for their political unity,
are thought to be key to forming
any future government. But even
they have been divided with an
upstart party called "Gorran" eat-
ing into their dominance.
Kurds have 4sarnessed their
power with the two main par-
ties - KDP and PUK - forming
a solid front on the national level
on issues they consider important
such as determining the future'of
disputed areas claimed by both
Arabs and Kurds. But Gorran's
rise could mean a less unified front
that may weaken Kurdish power.
Many have viewed the elec-
tionfas a key test of whether the
country can finally overcome the
sectarianism that has divided
Iraq, a country once ruled by
Saddam Hussein's iron-fisted
Sunni-minority rule then by a
Shiite-majority government.
But the election season showed
just how difficult it will be for
Iraq to put that deadly chapter
behind it. Instead of issues such
as security or government ser-
vices dominating the campaign,
it centered on the country's divi-
sive Baathist past after a govern-
ment committee with murky legal
standing banned hundreds of
candidates for alleged ties to Sad-
dam's regime - including many
high-profile Sunni candidates.
After polls opened in the morn-
ing, loudspeakers from mosques
across the country called on Iraq-
is to vote. In the Shiite Baghdad
neighborhood of Hurriyah - where
three people were killed when
someone threw a grenade into a
crowd of voters - clerics chal-
lenged people togo to thepolls like
"arrows to the enemies' chest."

Wrongly redefined
State Senate shouldn't limit stem cell research
n November 2008, Michigan voters took socially progres-
sive action when they voted in favor of a ballot initiative that
loosened restrictions on stem cell research in the state. Since
then, the state and the University have made promising progress
in stem cell research. But those strides may soon be halted as
legislation, which would redefine a crucial component of the bal-
lot initiative, makes its way to the Senate floor. The legislation
would be detrimental to the progress of stem cell research across
the state. In order to continue to lead in this research, the state
Senate shouldn't handcuff researchers by approving legislation
that would limit stem cell research.

Aiding student loans

The proposed legislation would alter
the term "not suitable for implantation"
of the ballot initiative. According to a Feb.
26 article in the Daily, the current propos-
al states that embryos aren't suitable for
implementation if they have defects or dis-
eases. Under the proposed legislation, the
classification of "unsuitable" would also
apply to embryos that lack wouldn't suc-
cessfully develop.
Some critics of the proposal, like Sean
Morrison, director of the University's Cen-
ter for Stem Cell Biology Research, believe
that it could stop researchers from find-
ing- potential cures as more embryos are
discarded. He points out that this legisla-
tion might "force patients to throw away
embryos" instead of "donating them for
stem cell research." Proponents of the
legislation, like state Sen. Tom George (K-
Kalamazoo), ch'air of the Senate Health
Policy Committee, claim that the new leg-
islation would clear up the language used
.ii the ballot initiative.
Ballot initiatives are admittedly often
too vaguely worded to operate properly
and require more legislation to specify
them. But the legislation before the state
Senate operates counter to the intent of
the ballot initiative by restricting stem cell
research. This legislation would limit the
research that Michigan residents sought

to encourage when they passed the ballot
initiative, and the Senate shouldn't take
action that would directly contradict the
will of the voters. i
The new legislation would also be a dis-
service to University research. The 2008
ballot initiative allowed the University to
expand its research facilities and attract
researchers. Greater restrictions would
limit the University's ability to move these
efforts forward. The legislation before the
state Senate would damage Michigan's
efforts to lead stem cell research.
Most importantly, the legislation would
hinder stem cell research that could lead
to monumental breakthroughs in medi-
cal science. Continued developments in
stem cell research could help save lives
and find cures to detrimental diseases like
Lou Gehrig's disease, juvenile diabetes
and Parkinson's disease. The state Senate
shouldn't stall these critical advances.
The state Senate must realize the nega-
tive effects of the legislation before reach-
ing a final decision that could very well
hinder stem cell research efforts in Michi-
gan. State legislators shouldn't take any
action that would slow the progress of this
vital research that is badly needed both by
this downtrodden state and by the millions
of people whose lives this work could one
day improve.

Back in September, the Daily
reported that the U.S. House
of Representatives had passed
the Student Aid
and Fiscal Respon-
sibility Act of
2009, which would
drastically reform
the student loan
system (How a i
federal fittancial
aid overhaul could
affect 'U' students,
9/24/09). The PATRICK
bill - which is 'A E
strongly support- O'MAHEN
ed by the Obama
administration -
was intended to improve efficiency,
expand lending and Pell grant pro-
grams, which would streamline the
process of applying for financial aid
and generally ease the burdens of col-
lege students everywhere.
Naturally, it's currently bogged
down in the U.S. Senate, where legis-
lation has long gone to die. One prob-
lem is that there are 289 other House
bills waiting for consideration in the
Senate, which has been struggling to
overcome Republican filibusters on
everything from confirming presi-
dential appointments to extending
unemployment insurance. The other
problem comes from several Demo-
cratic senators representing bank-
friendly states who seem dead set on
weakening the bill's central propos-
als that would both save the federal
government money and expand stu-
dent services.
The legislation's major proposed
changes deal with the provision of
federal loans. Currently, federal stu-
dent loans work in two ways. The
more complicated one is the Federal
Family Education Loan Program,
which involves private lenders as
middlemen. The government pro-
vides private lenders with capital,
subsidizes the interest rate and then
guarantees the loan.
In return for the subsidies, which
amount to $4.5 billion annually, the
private lenders provide the added

service of... er...
(Awkward silence)
Well, actually no one is really
sure what value the banks add to the
transaction except for pocketing tax-
payer money. Writing in the online
magazine Slate in 2007, Michael
Kinsley pointed out that the govern-
ment already guarantees debt - its
own borrowing to finance the bud-
get deficit-for a considerably lower
interest rate than it does for those it
helps to subsidize under. the FFEL
program. What would make sense
theen is for the government to cut out
the msiddleman and directly loan out
its own money. After all, that $4.5
billion could fund roughly 900,000
additional Pell grants for needy col-
lege students.
Actually, the other major govern-
ment loan program, Federal Direct
Loans, already uses this mecha-
nism. The student aid legislation that
passed the House in September effec-
tively cancels the FFEL program and
makes all loans direct loans, then
allocates the projected net $80 bil-
lion in savings over the next 10 years
to expanding funding for Pell Grants
and improving community colleges.
Let's see: the feds cut out inefficient
subsidies and use the savings to pro-
vide resources poor students desper-
ately need. Who could possibly object?
The first group consists of the
usual Republican free-market blow-
hards who object to a "government
takeover" of the student loan mar-
ket. This contention is hogwash, as
the government is only taking over
the government student loan pro-
gram. No law prevents private lend-
ers from offering their own student
loans - they just wouldn't get federal
subsidies to do so. That sounds pretty
free-market to me. Besides, the gov-
ernment still will bid out for private
banks to collect and administer its
loans, so it's not like private banks are
completely getting cut out of the loop.
The other opposition group con-
sists of more familiar suspects - the
private lending agencies that make
a killing at the government feeding

trough. They couldn't stop the House
bill improving education, but now
that it's cooling its heels in the Sen-
ate, they're lobbying their states' sen-
ators ferociously totry to water down
the bill's death sentence for the FFEL
program.
Senators should
reform student
loan policies.
These firms tend to be concen-
trated in a few states with loose
banking laws, like Nebraska, where
Democratic Senator Ben Nelson -
yes, the same one who nearly stopped
health care reform - has been press-
ing on behalf of his constituents like
Nelnet, a lending agency in Lincoln,
Nebraska. Of course the Lincoln
Journal Star noted in 2007 that Nel-
net also received $278 million in sub-
sidies of highly questionable legality.
But since the firm donated heavily
to Nelson and other Nebraska polls,
that makes it okay, right? Delaware
is another state with loads of private
student lenders, like Sallie Mae. Not
surprisingly, as The Hill, a newspa-
per specializing in covering Congress
reports, the state's two Senators,
Democrats Ted Kaufman and Tom
Carper, have also been lobbying to
weaken the proposal.
So Michigan students, roughly
14,000 of you took out federal loans
last year, and about 3,400 received
Pell Grants. Maybe it's time for.you to
call your senators and remind them
who they really represent - espe-
cially if you are from Delaware or
Nebraska. Help your fellow scholars
out and get the Student Aid and Fis- I
cal Responsibility Act of 2009 passed
into law.

The waiting is the hardest part

Last year, the Michigan Vision Party was
formed by a group of students upset at the direc-
tion of the Michigan Student Assembly. We
were passionate about changing MSA to make
it transparent, accountable and, moost impor-
tant, focused on students. By asking the simple
question, "What's your vision?," we were able to
return ownership of the Assembly back to the
students. This semester, that passion is back.
After a year of leading the Assembly, the Michi-
gan Vision Party has delivered on our vision.
We've provided real results and real progress for
the University community.
What are our real results? We've put on big
events for students like, "Go Blue, Beat OSU
Week," and we will be putting on a major con-
cert on campus next month. In addition, we've
done smaller events to unite the student body
and make MSA more visible. These include our
weekly MSA Mondays on the Diag (with free
bagels) and a Campus Leadership Colloquium
for studentleaders.
We've fought for students' rights. We've taken
the lead in working with the University admin-
istration to revise the Statement of Students'
Rights and Responsibilities to better protect
students and we are lobbying the state to pass a
law providing amnesty to minors who take their
intoxicated friends to the hospital. To further
protect students, we've increased awareness of
laptop,registration, nearly doubling the number
of registered laptops, and are working to give
students the right to elect fellow students to the
Department of Public Safety Oversight Commit-
tee. Most important, we have fought for more
state funding for higher education to help lower
our tuition.
We've worked to make the everyday Univer-
sity experience better. We've reformed MSA to
make it focused on students and student issues.
Last year, we heard from students that the gov-
ernment wasn't working for the students. In
response, the Michigan Vision Party led the
push to restrict MSA business so that only stu-
dent-related issues are addressed. Members of
MVP also led and are now rolling out the most
comprehensive reform to student government
in decades by way of the proposed new constitu-
tion, which will make student government more
effective. Furthermore, we worked to increased
diversity awareness on campus, improve the
campus climate for student veterans and sought
change on a host of other issues. Finally, student

organization funding increased by 18 percent
this past year, meaning that student organiza-
tions have received more money than ever to put
on the events that enhance the Michigan experi-
ence. Our guiding focus is that the student voice
be heard and that a student solution is enacted.
What's our vision for the future? We plan on
building on the progress of this year. We want to
continue putting on large campus-wide events
for students to enjoy. And with the departure of
the founder of MSA's Airbus, which transports
thousands of students to the airport each break,
we want to revamp Airbus to make sure it lasts
for future students to use.
We also needeto continue fighting for students'
rights. The fact is that the administration doesn't
take students seriously right now, and we want to
change that so student voices are always heard.
To do this, we're committed to putting quality
students at every level of the administration to
stand up for students when decisions are made.
This goes all the way upto the regent level, where
we will push a state constitutional amendment
fdr a student regent. It's a radical idea, but unless
there's a student on the Board of Regents fighting
for students, students will always lose.
Finally, our executives fully endorse and
understand the new Constitution, and, should it
pass, they'll be ready to lead a new, efficient stu-
dent government from day one.
Our vision is to make the Michigan Student
Assembly a place for students to make campus a
better place. MSA should be a forum for students
to express their visions, have their voices heard
and expect real results. To us, that's real progress.
Real Vision. Real Results. Real Progress.
MVP has made sure that our vision reflects
student concerns and that we have delivered
solutions. People may tell you that MSA doesn't
do anything, but our results show that isn't the
case. MSA has become an effective medium for
students under MVP's leadership. But there is
always more work to be done, and we look for-
ward to continuing the real progress we have
already made.,
Don't be fooled. You'll hear a lot of prom-
ises this election - that is common in politics.
We're proud to say that we have done some-
thing uncommon: actually delivered on our
promises.
This viewpoint was written by John Lin
on behalf of the Michigan Vision Party.

Jm a shameless policy dork. I
love debating the issues that
are confronting our society.
I'm fascinated by
the ideas ema-
nating from the
brightest minds
of history and ,
the world today.
I even can't resist
entering sponta-
neous arguments
with those people
on street cor- AL.EX
ners demanding
President Barack SCHIII
Obama's impeach-_
anent because - as
one passionate little fellow put it -
"global warming is politician code
for depopulating the world." And to
think of the good ole' '90's - when
the president was impeached for get-
ting blowjobs from an intern. How
silly that episode looks now! I mean
seriously, blowjobs? Lame. Obama's
gonna pull the plug on grandma!
But I have a long, complicated and
self-abusive love-hate relationship
with politics. Following politics this
past year has been a lot like watching
the 2009 Michigan football team. A
new pool of promising players comes
in (Democratic takeover of Congress
and the White House = Tate Forcier
and other talented freshmen), a few
early successes give us hope that
we can really achieve something
this year (Notre Dame = passage of
stimulus bill) and then everything
implodes and we realize nothing has
changed (ending 1-7 = liberal Mas-
sachusetts electing Republican Scott
Brown to the U.S. Senate right before
health care reform is about to be
passed).
The legislative process has ground
to a sputtering halt. Congress is
approaching Michigan Student
Assembly levels of impotency - and
that's where I draw the line. After
a few early victories for Obama,
something happened that made this
country border on ungovernable. I
think it was right around the time

that Republicans realized that a lot
of people actually believe the lies
they spread about death panels and
mandatory abortions. Obama put
everything on hold for health care
reform, and when health care reform
stopped, so did the nation.
I'm not just complaining about
partisan gridlock because I live in
some Michigan Daily idealist fanta-
syland where reform is possible with
the snap of Obama's fingers. This is
about uncertainty. Right or wrong,
Obama has plans to reform the health
care, financial and energy-related
sectors of the economy that collec-
tively make up about a third of our
gross domestic product (17.3 percent,
8.3 percent and 8.8 percent, respec-
tively) based on the 2009, 2006 and
2006 statistics (the latest data avail-
able), according to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, a
study by Roubini Global Econom-
ics and the U.S. Energy Information
Administration respectively. That's
an undeniably revolutionary change.
But with Congress acting like a
bunch of toddlers arguing over who
took who's boo bear, the outcome of
these reforms and, by extension, the
long-term fundamental structure of
our economy remains mired in pro-
found uncertainty. This uncertainty
- not the substance of Obama's pro-
posals - is damaging any hope for
economic recovery.
America is just emerging from an
economic downturn that featured
an inflation-adjusted 34.2 percent
decline in investment spending,
according to the Bureau of Economic
Analysis. As businesses regain their
footing, they are unlikely to resume
investment of normal levels amid
such gross uncertainty.
Pfizer won't invest in a new can-
cer treatment when it doesn't know
the fate of health care reform or how
it will ultimately affect the industry.
J.P. Morgan won't even think about
giving out loans at a reasonable rate
again until they know how financial
reform will affect them, so business-
es will remain starved of the credit

they need to expand their operations
and hire more workers. Clean energy
companies won't invest in the tech-
nologies of tomorrow when they
don't know if the energy market will
continue to impose no price on pollu-
tion and greenhouse gas emission.
In short, why would anyone invest
in their future when they don't know
what the rules are goingto be?
Uncertainty is
stalling progress
from happening.
Economies thrive on invest-
ment. Any economist will tell you
that investment today yields higher
growth for tomorrow. But with leg-
islation that has the potential to
have so much impact stuck in limbo,
businesses are hesitant to invest in
new projects and entrepreneurs are
unlikely to embark on new initia-
tives - two principal sources of job
growth. In the end, whether you
agree with Obama's proposals or
not, markets care a lot more about
certainty than they do about the sub-
stance of the policies themselves.
Passing reform and alleviating the
uncertainty afflicting the financial
markets will be the best stimulus our
economy could ever receive.
Congress, get your act together
and pass the reform America voted
for when it put the Democrats in con-
trol of government. If the American
people truly don't like the ideas that
they have put forward, they will vote
the Democrats out in favor of people
that will repeal their legislation and
go in the opposite direction. That's
how democracy works when it's
functioning properly.

head did an electronica album."
Truth be told, I really had no
idea what electronica is, or what
it could be. To me, electronica
was little more than the yuppie-
on-ecstasy rave-up techno that
polluted radio waves after hours.
I saw it more as an excuse to initi-
ate orgies on dance floors than asa
legitimate form of music. And if it
wasn't in a club, then it was ambient
and boring; the floaty, sleep-tape
sort of music that snobs in berets
would listen to in order to prove
they could.
Electronica is what I'Jike to call
a "bastard genre" - a genre that, for
whatever reason, hasbeen shoved
into the backseat of pop culture.
Jazz and metal arebastard genres
too. And while I'm still slightly
terrified of metal, I amhere to tell
you that electronica is notjust for
computer nerds and club creepers.
It is for you. There is an electronica
album outthere that will change
your life if you listen to it.And I'm
hopingthat, by giving you an eclec-
tic shortlist of some of the more
accessible albums and artists who
have changed my life over the years,
I can, at the very least, provide you
with somethingthatwon't put you
to sleep or give you a migraine.
Let's start with the king, 1998's
Music Has the Right to Children

record that popped my cherry, and

Melodramatic
and mustachioed

By ANDREW LAPIN
SeniorArts Editor
There's an awful lot of scenery-
chewing going on in "The Last
Station," a movie
about Russian
novelist Leo
Tolstoy's final The Cast
days. But no one
owns this movie StatnOfl
like Paul Gia- At the
matti's glorious Michigan
handlebar mus-
tache. Thick and Sony
bushy, with the
ends teased at sharp angles, it's
all anyone can focus on when Gia-
matti ("Sideways") is onscreen.
This wonderful facial eccentricity
evokes an image closer to Snidely
Whiplash than Vladimir Chertkov
(the real-life Russian writer and
Tolstoyan Giamatti is playing),
and yet, since the proceedings sur-
rounding the mustache are pitched
at a level of cartoonish hysteria,
 the construction of said mustache
feels surprisingly justified.
Alas, Chertkov and his upper
lip are meant to be enjoyed only
as auxiliaries to this story. Writer-
director Michael Hoffman ("The
Emperor's Club"), working from
the historical novel by Jay Parini,
has elected instead to cast James
McAvoy ("Wanted") as the nar-
rative's fulcrum. McAvoy plays a
bland, naive writer named Valen-
tin Bulgakov, a Tolstoy sycophant
who is invited to be the man's
latest secretary and live on the
nearby compound populated by
the cult-like followers of his writ-
ings. He sports a rather drab goa-
tee-type thing that, unfortunately,
befits his character all too well.
McAvoy's chief job is to stare
wide-eyed at the domestic squab-
bles that erupt between Tolstoy and
his wife, until it's his turn to finally
think for himself. Yawn. Anyway,
the real meat of the story, and the
ham acting, is Tolstoy's love/hate
relationship, which actually does
occupy both extremes of that spec-
trum. Both Christopher Plummer
("Up"), as Tolstoy, and Helen Mir-
ren ("The Queen"), as the Countess
Sofya, received Oscar nominations
for their high-class screaming and
lovemaking. Mirren preens and
flops about, as per her character,
and she's just charming enough to
avoid audience revulsion.
Plummer's long, thick beard

keeps up the high facial hair stan-
dards set by Giamatti. Tolstoy's
beard, after all, was the source
of his power. Helen Mirren, dis-
appointingly, shows no effort to
similarly adorn her visage with
some mutton chops - not even a
Fu Manchu.
Wait, there's still a movie to
review.
All of the actors are more than
adequate in their roles, and the
film has a very nice look to it; there
are several gorgeous sweeping
vistas of the Russian countryside.
The problem is we can't take "The
Last Station" seriously as drama
because the characters over-emote
so much. There's operatic, and
then there's soap-operatic.
For at least the first half of the
movie this doesn't seem to be a
problem, since it's pitched as a
comedy, complete with the most
refreshingly awkward virgin-
deflowering scene ever commit-
ted to film. But around the time
we're supposed to root against
Giamatti's mustache in favor of the
crazy-yet-eternal bond the Tolstoys
share with each other, the movie
loses its mojo. There was never any
dramatic weight here, but we're
A campy look at
Leo Tolstoy.
cheated into thinking we missed it
somewhere between the countess's
gaudy suicide attempts.
The greatness of Tolstoy as an
author and philosopher is well-
established, and those more famil-
iar with the man's life and writings
may glean a bit more interest from
watching a dramatization of his
end. Butrthen again, the film doesn't
show much respect forthe old coot,
and that's not even taking into
account all of the British accents
these supposed Russians are sport-
ing. Was this really one of the most
celebrated writers in the world?
A hypocritical horndog who liked
making rooster noises in bed with
his wife?
If "The Last Station" is to be
enjoyed, it's as a campy fun casualty
of the costume drama genre. And if
they ever make an Oscar for Best
Facial Hair, that will finally be the
one Paul Giamatti wins.

OLYMPICS
From Page 1A
"To all the people that have
helped us over the years - our
coaches and parents - itjustmeans
so much," White said.
Though she had dreamed about
competing in the Olympics since
she began skating at the age of five,
Davis said the games exceeded all
her expectations.
"As an athlete, you have a long
time to kind of wonder what the
Olympics might be like and kind
of build up the experience in your
head," Davis said. "But for us, it
was just an incredible experience,
and it was everything we hoped
for."
Coming into the competition,
many were optimistic that the
two skaters would take the gold -
which would have been the first
time that a pair from the United
States came out on top in ice danc-
ing at the Olympics.
But White said the two couldn't
be more pleased with their silver
medals.
"We put in so much time and
effort over the 13 years we've been
together," he said. "To be able to
skate so well at the Olympics and
come away with a silver medal was
very satisfying."
DaviM emphatically agreed with
White.
"The Olympics is such a pinna-
cle of our sport, and it only comes
every four years," she said. "So in
order to be true you really don't
want to make any mistakes. You
want to skate your best, and for us
we definitely did that, and we came
away not only proud of our silver
medals, but proud of the way we
skated."
During their time at the Olym-
pics, the pair got the chance to
skate to some pop culture favor-
ites. For the Exhibition portion of
the competition, they performed
to a cover of Michael Jackson's Bil-
lie Jean. Their free dance was to
music from musical "Phantom of
the Opera" and for their original
dance, the two skated to a medley
of Indian songs. ,
When asked which was his
favorite performance, White lik-
ened the dances to the pair's "chil-
dren" and said he couldn't choose.
"Honestly, I can't pick one
because they were all so good that
without anyone of them, you know,
it might not have happened the way
it did," he said.
The pair's coaches, Igor Shpil-
band and Marina Zoueva, also
trained the Canadian pair that
claimed gold in Vancouver, Virtue
and Moir. Both pairs have been
training with each other for the

students via cell phone calls and
e-mail.
"The power went out in the capi-
tal, and so some people were out of
touch longer than others," Godfrey
said. "We spent a number of hours
on the weekend making sure we
knew the students were safe."
According to A.T. Miller, direc-
tor of the Center for Global and
Intercultural Study, the students'
emergency contacts - usually
parents - were informed of the
students' whereabouts. Also, Ponti-
ficia Universidad Cat6lica de Chile
buildings have undergone safety
inspections before they are sched-
uled to re-open today.
Miller said that while none of the
students were injured or endan-
gered during the quake, several

tiago, some not returning to the city

Taylor said the network's ultra-
fast speed would enable local
entrepreneurs to make key tech-
nological advances that might
otherwise be impossible.
"There's latent creativity that
would be unleashed by the fiber-
to-home network," Taylor said.
Taylor also emphasized the
presence of the University as a
key factor in the city's applica-
tion.
The University, and the Uni-

lar, would benefit from the faster

notion was to try to keep things

who sits on MSA's Academic
Affairs Advisory Committee and
LSA-SG's Academic Affairs Com-
mission, and MSA Rep. John Lin,
chair of MSA's Academic Affairs
Commission and a member of
SACUAs Academic Affairs Advi-
sory Committee said they are talk-
ing to students and faculty about
the resolutions in hope of making
them a reality.
"We want students to choose
classes they truly enjoy," Levine
said. "When students are passion-
ate about a certain class, they will
do better in it."
Lin said the problem with
the current system is that many
course descriptions are vague
and don't provide an accurate
description of the course require-
ments. Students may come in to a
class with certain expectations,
which often times aren't met.
This may lead to many students
dropping or swapping courses,
he said.
"There is no question that the
status quo is not working," Lin
said. "Professors want better
informed students, and this new
system will provide that."
Arthur F. Thurnau Prof. Timo-
thy McKay, who teaches physics
and astronomy at the University
and is the director of the LSA
Honors Program, wrote in an
e-mail interview that he and his
colleagues have been working
with MSA representatives to come
up with effective and practical
approaches to this initiative.
"Course selection plays a cen-
tral role in each student's educa-
tion," McKay wrote. "Providing
students with the best possible
information and advice as they
select courses is an essential task
for the University."
McKay added that most of the
members of SACUA agree with
the resolution.
Statistics lecturer Tom Ven-
able said the resolution seems like

than we anticipated?," Coleman
said.
With so many unknowns,
Coleman said the one thing she
can promise is that she'll do
her best to ensure any tuition
increase will be as modest as
possible.
"What I will promise is that
we will do everything with-
in our power to keep the cost
(affordable)," Coleman said. "We
understand how important that
is to students."
Coleman also reaffirmed the
University's commitment to
meeting the full demonstrated
financial need of all in-state stu-
dents, pledging to again increase
financial aid by at least as much
as tuition is increased.
a "reasonable request," but that
he's notsure how the logistics of it
would be handled and who would
monitor instructors to make sure
they posted the syllabi.
"Sometimes, say for a profes-
sor teaching a course for the first
time, perhaps they may want to
decline," he said. "But in general,
it seems a good idea."
Though MSA and LSA-SG are
making a push to have professors
provide the syllabi for registra-
tion for fall 2010 classes - which
begins in April - Lin said the ini-
tiative may have some glitches,
as many professors won't know
which courses they will be teach-
ing until August.
It is unlikely that the initiative
will be set into place for the next
period of registration, but it will
hopefully be implemented in a
couple of semesters, Lin said.
McKay wrote that another
possible challenge for the ini-
tiative is that syllabi "take very
different forms across the Uni-
versity."
Lin said Princeton Univer-
sity has a similar system as the
one MSA and LSA-SG seek to
implement. During the registra-
tion period, Princeton offers a
complete course guide, excerpts
from course readings and a grade
breakdown for each course,
according to Lin.
"I feel it would be a win-win
situation for students and faculty,"
Levine said. "The resolution is a
great initiative and would be on
the leading edge for universities
in the nation in terms of registra-
tion."
LSA freshman Katy Scharf said
she thinks the initiative would
definitelybenefitto students when
they're registering for classes
because it would offer students a
more holistic description of what
a class will involve.
"I think professors should be
required to post a syllabus before
registration so that students can
understand what the workload
will be like and what the readings
will entail,"'she said.

Engineering sophomore Kevin
Shallcross, who is currently study-
ing in Santiago, said that transpor-
tation was the biggest hassle he
dealt with as a result of the quake,
which collapsed many of the coun-
try's bridges and put the roads in
poor condition.
Though serious aftershocks have
since struck the country, Shallcross
said the students are planning to
remain in Chile.
"Chile's infrastructure is built
to withstand seismic activity, so
restoration is probably faster here
than anywhere else," Shallcross
said. "I feel safe where I am, so I
plan to continue with my studies."
Miller confirmed that Santiago
is safe, and the international pro-
grams in the city are continuing as
planned.
Miller added that the Center
for Global and Intercultural Study
is looking into ways students in
Chile can become involved in relief

Kosteva said the University
already has its own fiber network,
but Google's network proposal
offers a much "higher capacity"
in terms of speed.
For that reason, Kosteva said
the University plans to support
the city in its application.
"This is a city application, but
the University is providing sup-
port," Kosteva said.
He added that if the network is
installed, the University plans to
be one of its significant subscrib-
ers.
The fiber network would serve
between 50,000 and 500,000
people, and promises to offer
competitive rates for subscribers,
according to the project's website.
Google Fiber's website states
that Google's network would

According to The Associated
Press, as of Friday, 452 people were
reported dead as a result of the
quake. Reconstruction is estimated
to cost between $12 billion and
$30 billion.
LSA junior Lyndsey Talon, a
student studying in Chile, said
she plans to join Chileans in their
efforts to, rebuild their country,
and said she is impressed by the
country's unity that has sprung up
in the aftermath of the quake.
"It reminds me of the United
States after 9/11 - flags every-

that the Chileans are dealing with

De ense,
its time-
to be the
hero
t was after Friday night's 5-2 win
over Lake Superior State when
senior captain Chris Summers
dropped a bomb regarding Michigan's
goalie situation.
"I don't know why there's so many
people who don't think that (junior
backup Shawn Hunwick) is a contend-
er to be a starting goalie," Summers
said. "He could be a starting goalie on
any team in the NCAA.
"He's proven everyone wrong."
There's no denying that Hunwick
has been serviceable. In four games of
action - his first
legitimate play-
ing time in his
three-year career
- Hunwick has two
shutouts and three
wins, with the one
slip-up coming at
the hands of Notre .
Dame in South
Bend. RYAN
He really has KARTJE
risen up as a solid
"relief pitcher," like
Berenson called him early in the sea-
son, enough so for the veteran coach
to refer to him after Saturday's 6-0
shutout of the Lakers as Michigan's
own "Rudy."
But the fate of the Wolverines' sea-
son does not rely on Hunwick proving
Summers' comments to be true - no
matter how far-fetched they may or
may not be.
Instead, Michigan's season and the
miniscule hopes of extending it past
the CCHA Tournament rest firmly
on the shoulders of Summers and the
highly touted defensive corps.
In the Wolverines' first-round sweep
of Lake Superior State, the defense
had one of its best performances of the
season, limiting the Lakers to very few
quality scoring opportunities. Aside
from a spectacular save Hunwick made
after the defense turned the puck over
in the first period of Saturday's game,
the junior goalie was rarely tested in
Michigan's dominant shutout.
By no means am I taking away from
Hunwick's performance in net. When
starting goaltender Bryan Hogan went
down with a groin injury - one that

Senior Steve Kampfer helped aid the Michigan defense in one of its best efforts of the season on Saturday, finishing with a plus-six plus/minus rating, one of Michigan's highest this season.

For the first time all year, the Michigan
hockey team's two seasons came together.
The season the Wolverines were sup-
posed to have, and the season they were
actually enduring became one for their
final two-game stretch of the year at Yost
Ice Arena this weekend.
The trio of players predicted to put up
big numbers in the preseason finally came

together in Michigan's sweep of Lake
Superior State (15-18-5) in its CCHA first
round series, notching a 5-2 victory Friday
and a 6-0 win Saturday.
Juniors Louie Caporusso and Carl Hage-
lin along with sophomore David Wohlberg
were the top three returning scorers from
a year ago. They combined for 10 points,
including six of the Wolverines' 11 goals on
the weekend.
On Saturday, Caporusso made sure he
wouldn't have to come back to Yost on
Sunday for a third and deciding game of
the series. After netting the team's first
and third goals, he joined a rush started by
Wohlberg to make it a three-on-two. Wohl-
berg laid the puck back to Caporusso, who
one-timed a snap shot into the net, giving
him his third career hat trick and his first
this season. r

"I had one intention, that was to work
hard and get shots on the net, put things on
the net because you never know what can
happen," Caporusso said.
But it was Wohlberg who set the offen-
sive tone for the weekend. After registering
30 points in his freshman campaign, Wohl-
berg had just 17 during the regular season
this year. But this weekend, he added three
points, including an assist on the first goal
Friday as well as the game's second goal.
Wohlberghas struggled with back issues
all season, but seems to be getting healvthy
as the team heads into the postseason.
"He just was never 100 percent," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said. "You could
see it in his skating. Now you can see that
he's jumping,'he's stronger, and with a lit-
tle bit of luck and hard work you get some
results. That's the David Wohlberg we saw

all last year and now he's finally feeling
healthy enough to play all out."
Hagelin, the alternate captain who has
lived up to and exceeded expectations this
season, was responsible for the final two
goals of the weekend. He also led the team
in shots, taking seven of the Wolverines'
46. Caporusso launched six, but enough
to get the extra goal that Hagelin couldn't
find late in the game.
As Michigan (21-17-1) headed into the
third period up six goals, the only drama
surrounded whether Hagelin could join
Caporusso with three goals.
"I got put on there for one shift with
him and I just was trying to get him the hat
trick," Caporusso said. "He's my best friend
I would have loved to see him getone too."
After the game, Hagelin led the Wolver-

dipped. "They just outplayed us."
It's hard for anyone to explain a
game like the one Michigan played
Sunday against Michigan State,
especially when the 64-48 loss
wasn't even as close as the final
score implied.
Given how well the Wolverines
played in their last game, a home
win against Minnesota, explana-
tions become even more difficult.
Then, Michigan shot 60 percent
and played suffocating defense to
soundly beat a team that had a lot
more to play for.
Yesterday? Michigan was
attacked from the opening tip by
Michigan State's physical style of
play. The Wolverines responded
poorly, turning the ball over and
allowing the Spartans to bully
them in the post.
"It was almost like our game
(against Minnesota) last week,
but in reverse," sophomore Zack
Novak said.
Michigan (7-11 Big Ten, 14-16
overall) was in the game for the
first nine minutes, thanks mostly

EAST LANSING -
Go ahead, throw the kitch-
en sink at me.
Tell me the reason
Michigan State won was because
it was playing for a share of the Big
Ten men's basketball title.
Say that the

a near loss to
Penn State last
week.

shots just don't
fall sometimes.
Sure, all those things are true,
and I don't want to take anything
away from a very impressive Spar-
tan performance. But after the two
games the Wolverines played last
week, was I too optimistic when I
thought, "Hmm, maybe this won't
be a blowout"?
Michigan showed heart against
Evan Turner and Ohio State a
week ago, leading at halftime and
never mailing it in, even when
Turner turned in yet another
Player-of-the-Year-worthy perfor-
mance.
And then Wednesday came -
the Wolverines' final home game
of the season. Against Minnesota,
a team fighting to remain on the
NCAA Tournament bubble, Michi-
gan played spoiler in one of its
best all-around efforts of the year.
Again, the Wolverines showed that
they hadn't thrown in the towel.

Coming into Sunday's game, I
figured it could be close. The two
teams battled through an epic one-
point game in January, one that
DeShawn Sims nearly won at the
buzzer. How about a Round Two?
Quickly and painfully, Michigan
State made sure the game's out-
come would never be questioned.
Michigan didn't just lose on Sun-
day - it was annihilated by a very
focused, very talented Spartan
squad.
I know this routine. Just when
the Wolverines string together two
decent games (yes, I'm including
the loss at Ohio State as a decent
performance), they fall apart for

But about halfway through
the first half, Spartan sophomore
Delvon Roe grabbed an offen-

Then, senior Raymar Morgan hit a

end and slammed home a dunk.
The score had gone from a man-
ageable 13-8 to a seemingly insur-

And the Wolverines never

recovered.
Michigan scored 14 total points
in the first half, which wasn't just
the worst first-half point totals for
Michigan - it tied for the lowest
total this year in the entire con-
ference. The Wolverines shooting
1-of-11 from beyond the are had
something to do with that.
Michigan State's extremely
physical defense also had some-
thing to do with it.
"That was probably one of the
more physical games we've ever

played," senior DeShawn Sims
said. "But that was their M.O., be
physical against Michigan."
The second half didn't offer
much reprieve.
Michigan didn't score for the
first four minutes of the second
frame and allowed the Spartans
(14-4,24-7)to stretch their already
sizeable lead to 28. At one point,

Penn State ends Michigan's
conference unbeaten streak.

After counting a fall
on uneven bars,
Blue can't recover
By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
It was a bittersweet finish to the
Big Ten regular season for the No.
12 Michigan women's gymnastics
team - a small victory, but a big-
ger defeat.
The squad posted its second-
highest mark of the season, but
was overpowered by the 17th-
ranked Nittany Lions in the Penn
State Quad, dismantling the Wol-
verines' hopes of an undefeated
conference schedule.
The Sunday meet saw Michi-
gan take second place, in front
of Maryland and Bridgeport, but
trailing Penn State by a score, of
196.725-196.575.
The finish was the Wolverines'
first Big Ten loss in over three
years, a streak of 32 consecutive
wins stretching back to Feb. 16,
2007 - also a loss against Penn
State.
"Unfortunately, we had to count
a fall on the uneven bars," Michi-
gan coach Bev Plocki said. "And at
this level of play and this late in the

season, you can't expect to count a
fall and walk away with a victory.
Except for several falls on the
night, the Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten,
12-2 overall) were very consistent.
But after two falls on the beam, the
team was all but doomed.
Going into the final rotation on
the balance beam trailing by .475,
the team erased most of its deficit,
boosted by a season-high score on
the beam, but it wasn't enough to
close the gap.
"We've had our trouble on
beam, but when we hit it, it's one
of our best events," Plocki said. "I
was very proud with how they fin-
ished beam tonight, and how we
almost caught back up with Penn
State."
And taking the top crown for
the balance beam was a surprising
performer, freshman Katie Zura-
les, who won her first collegiate
event with a career-high 9.925.
Zurales also nailed a 9.900 on
the vault, another career-best, but
her victory on beam capped off a
great afternoon.
"There was no way I was let-'
ting my team down," Zurales said
of her beam routine. "I did every-
thing in my power to make it, and
it was just very exciting and suc-
cessful."
From a coach's standpoint, the

breakout performance was no sur-
prise.
"Katie started off the season
slow because she had mono and
some other injuries," Plocki said.
"But she was very, very impressive.
She is just startingto come into her
own, and I hope that it will con-
tinue and carry her into the post-
season."
Another standout routine came
from freshman Natalie Beilstein,
who received scores of 9.900 for
both her vault and floor routines.
In the all-around, junior Kylee
Botterman paced the Wolverines
with a 39.500, while senior Sarah
Curtis hit with a 39.450 total.
But even with the successes
across the board, it was the slight
slip-ups that cost the team this
time. The Wolverines will aim to
fix those mishaps as they gear up
for the postseason.
As Michigan looks ahead to a
looming matchup against No.5
Georgia at Crisler Arena next Fri-
day, it will be searching for consis-
tency and precision.
"We're just looking forward to
trying to continue to improve and
drop our low scores," Plocki said.
"And with that we can hopefully
improve our ranking as much as
possible before we go to regionals
to help us with our seeding."

while he wasn't really that tested

"Keeping it simple" - it's a small
phrase that junior Louie Caporus-
so has reiterated over the past few
weeks to describe his recent offen-
sive resurgence.
And while Caporusso isn'treally
saying a lot with his explanation,
the three words depict the whole
story and the former Hobey Baker
finalist's rise to the spot of second-
leading scorer, behind junior Carl
Hagelin.
Caporusso has 15 points in his
last 13 games, scoring his first hat

trick of the season this past week-
end against Lake Superior State.
Earlier in the season, accord-
ing to Caporusso, he was try-
ing to do too much with the puck
and thinking too much on the ice.
The Woodbridge, Ontario native
has minimized his over-thinking
and has, instead, reverted more
to reacting to the play at hand.
The change in his approach to the
game has certainly paid off.
"There's always a little pres-
sure, that comes with hockey, that
comes with life," Caporusso said.
"But tm not going to worry about
it too much. I'm going to play. At
the end of the day, you got to keep
it simple."

was without senior captain Chris
Summers, who went knee-to-knee
with Lake Superior's Dan Barczuk
midway through the first period
and left the ice, never to return.
Berenson said that Summers had
sustained a "lower-body injury,"
and that he did no know when Sum-
mers would return.
If Summers can't go against No. 2
seed Michigan State next weekend,
the seventh-seeded Wolverines
could be without their captain and
their starting goalie junior Bryan
Hogan, who has been out with a
groin injury since Feb. 25.
The injuries obviously weren't

after two games where everything
came together, Michigan's two sea-

the ice Friday, win or lose.

Michigan sweeps
four-game week

'M' falls in Big Ten Tourney

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
Staying focused on the next
pitch is the No. 7 Michigan soft-
ball team's mantra this season and
the Wolverines put their pitch and
plate discipline on display this past
weekend. Michigan won all four of
its games at the Easton SEC/Mid-
west Challenge in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
"(Playing one-pitch softball)
helps you be able to control the
pressure," senior pitcher Nikki
Nemitz said. "If (the game) gets tir-
ing ortough, you know that you just
have to be great for that one pitch.
It's an easier way of thinking of the
game, than thinking 'Okay, were
going to be on the road for eleven
days and going to play ten games.'
That's tough."
The Wolverines (14-4) show-
cased one-pitch softball in Friday's
5-2 win against No. 8 Alabama.
Michigan was down 2-0 after the
third inning, but stayed focused to
rally back. The Wolverines scored
one run in the fourth, one run in
the sixth and three runs in the
seventh to eventually overtake the
Crimson Tide.
Following what Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins called "an emo-
tional win," the Wolverines bats
were quiet'in a 1-0 win over South
Carolina .on Saturday. But again,
Michigan adjusted its approach
to manage a win, this time behind
senior Nikki Nemitz's solid seven
innings.
"Good teams find ways to win,"
Hutchins said. "The first Alabama
game Friday night was a big win
(and) Saturday morning we were
definitely flat against South Caro-
lina. Give their pitcher credit, but
we didn't make adjustments at
the plate. But we played defense
and held them, which is what you
have to do until your offense can
win it. Then we turned around and
had another big game against Ala-.
bama."
Michigan faced Alabama for the
second time on Saturday, with the

Wolverines winning the contest
4-2. Senior outfielder Angela Find-
lay had Alabama's number this past
weekend, with two hits, one run
scored and two RBI on Friday. She
added two hits and two RBI in Sat-
urday's contest.
"I'm just really focusing on going
up there and doing what I need to
do for my team at the plate," Find-
lay said. "Whether that's getting on
base, driving people in, or putting
a bunt down for the runners, my
focus is just going up there and get-
ting good atbats."
Michigan defeated South Caro-
lina 8-0 in just five innings in Sun-
day's finale. Nemitz pitched two
scoreless innings before freshman
pitcher Stephanie Speierman got
the .call. Speierman picked up her
first win of the season, as she tossed
three innings, giving up no hits or
walks, while striking out three.
"All the coaches agreed we
wished that we wouldn't have
ended the game early with our
offense," Hutchins said. "(Speier-
man) was just getting going. We
haven't had a lot of opportunity
to really see what she can do, but
we were pleased with her perfor-
mance. She maintained, made her
pitches work, and she got them to
make outs."
As the Wolverines head to Lou-
isville, Ken. to play in the Red and
Black Tournament next weekend,
the team looks to build on their
complete performances from this
past weekend.
And with their bats heating up
this past weekend, Hutchins would
like to see the Wolverines build on
their recent offensive successes.
"We're beginning to play with
some consistency," Hutchins said.
"We're 18 games into the season,
and our hope is to get consistency
in all areas of our game. Our pitch-
ing has been pretty consistent and
our defense has been pretty con-
sistent. Its typical that the offense
is the last to go, but I'm starting to
see some things and some good at
bats."

INDIANAPOLIS - It all looked
over with just 5:35 remaining in
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team's 61-50 loss to Michigan
State. Freshman guard Dayeesha
Hollins had committed her fifth
foul and was replaced by sopho-
more guard Courtney Boylan.
Shortly after that, the Spar-
tans went up by 11 at the Conseco
Fieldhouse in the quarterfinal
round of the Big Ten Tournament,
junior guard Veronica Hicks air-

there was
nothing that could slow the Spar-
tans down.
"We started off quickly," Boylan
said. "We played a day ago, so we
were used to the court. We were
just excited and readyto go. I don't
necessarily know what happened
in the second half But it wasn't
good. It was frustrating. It seems
like when we tried to be aggres-
sive we would get a foul called. But
then on the other end we couldn't
do anything. They just pressure
the ball very well."
The Wolverines kept it close
in the first-half. They were quick
out of the gate, catching Michigan
State offguard. Michigan led by as
many as eight points. But by half-
time; Michigan State put together
a full effort, going ahead 32-29.
"Offensively, we didn't slow
down as much," Hicks said. "It
was on the defensive end that we
were not getting as many stops.
They started getting a few more
offensive rebounds, then we
started getting foul calls and they
were able to get to the line a lot.
Our defense wasn't getting stops."
Senior center Krista Phillips
was on top of the pack with eight
points of her own in the first half.
Spartan senior center Allyssa
DeHaan left the game in the mid-
dle of the first half after a move
from Phillips triggered a back
spasm DeHaan had suffered from
earlier in the week. DeHaan's
injury left Phillips as the tallest
player on the court and giving the
Wolverines a size advantage.
But the injury didn't help the
struggling Michigan squad as the
Spartans were able to take advan-
tage of Michigan's foul problems.
The Spartans got eight points
from the charity stripe alone in
the first half. And then in the sec-
ond stanza, it was free throws
again that doomed the Wolver-
ines. e

TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daily
Freshman Dayeesha Hollins, pictured here, scored six points and fouled out in Michigan's 61-50 loss to rival Michigan State. The
loss knocked the Wolverines out ofithe Big Ten Tournament and put them on the bubble for an at-large NCAA Tournament bid.

starters were in foul trouble,"
Boylan said. "Them getting to the
line gives them huge momentum.
(Dayeesha) is in there and she
picks up three, then the tripping
call and she's out. (Hicks) had to
sit because she had three or four
fouls, and even (freshman guard)
Jenny Ryan had to sit early in the
game because she had some trou-
ble."
With the foul trouble, Michi-
gan had to play its starters very
conservatively.
And even when the Spartans
missed their foul shots Michigan
still couldn't capitalize. Michi-
gan State collected 17 offensive
boards and cashed them in for 14
second-chance points. The Spar-

tans dominated the glass all night,
they beat the Wolverines 41-29 in
rebounds.
"They started getting a few
more offensive rebounds," Hicks
said. "They collected loose balls
and offensive rebounds. When
thathappened that started mak-
ing our offense a little more stag-
nant because it gave them more
confidence in transitions."
Michigan knew that rebounds
would be a significant factor in the
game, and that it would be hard
to outrebound a more aggressive
team in the Spartans.
"I think you have to be able to
make somea of those," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said. "It's
a little tougher to get to the rim

obviously because they really
got the gaps shrunk and they're
a lot bigger than we are, a lot
more physical. They played good
defense-but they're physical. You
try to get open and they bump."
The Wolverines wound up cut-
ting the lead to just eight points
with a minute left, but Michigan
State drained another 3-pointer at
the shot clock buzzer and Michi-
gan didn't attempt to foul.
"I'd like to begin by saying the
beginning of the year they picked
us to finish 11th in the confer-
ence," Borseth said. "Last? Well,
we didn't. We finished tied for
sixth, which was pretty good. In
our eyes obviously we'd like to fin-
ish a little bit better."

"I'm sure our record would be two
or three games different. But you
can't put it all on one guy. This is a
team, and there are other guys that
ought to be able to get it done."
But so far, nobody has stepped
into that role. The varied attempts
to replace LaMarre's production in
the lineup continued to fizzle over
the weekend. Redshirt freshman
Tyler Mills and senior Mike Kit-
tle both got starting nods against
North Carolina, but they, along
with redshirt sophomore Garrett
Stephens and redshirt freshman
Kevin Krantz, have failed to secure
the vacant leftfield spot.
It's an issue that needs to be
resolved with the outfielder out
of action for at least another three
weeks.
"I think some guys are pressing,
trying to do too much," Maloney
said. "With LaMarre out of the

The squad showed grit in com-
ing back from a 6-1 deficit Saturday
by scoring five runs in the final
three innings and nearly stealing a
win from UNC's grasp.
But despite their best efforts,
the Wolverines were unable to
pick up a single victory in Chapel
Hill. The sweep left abitter taste in
the mouths of the players as they
returned to Ann Arbor, hoping to
regroup for next weekend when
they compete in the Caravelle
Resort Classic in South Carolina.
"We're ekind of tired of just
taking moral victories out here,"
Berset said. "We're ready to win
games. We're going to have bad
games, but we got to keep battling
out there. We've got to learn from
this and move on."

For the Daily
After upsetting then-No. 5 Bay-
lor University 4-3 on Feb. 26, the
Wolverines improved their rank-
ing to No. 7, the highest in team
history. With a7-0 shut out against
Loyola Marymount on March 3,
Michigan didn't have much trou-
ble leaving its California spring
break trip with another victory
last Friday.
The Wolverines defeated Pep-
perdine for the first time ever,
improving their record against the
Waves to 1-3. The Wolverines (10-
3) dropped just one singles match
to the Waves (4-7), winning 6-1.
"Pepperdine is a very solid
team," Michigan'coach Ronni Ber-
nstein said. "We knew we were
going to have to play well and we
definitely stepped up."
One of this season's best play-
ers has been Michigan freshman
Mimi Nguyen, whose victory on
Friday clinched the match for the
Wolverines. Nguyen improved to
a team-best 11-2 in dual matches
after defeating Pepperdine's Ali
Walters at No. 3 singles, 6-3, 6-3.
"As a freshman I have to adjust
to college tennis and having a lot
of success really boosts my confi-

dence," Nguyen said.
Nguyen is also half of the 32nd-
ranked doubles team with sopho-
more Michelle Sulahian. The pair
dropped just their second doubles
msatch all season on Friday, losing
to Pepperdine's Marie Zalameda
and Anamika Bhargava 8-7. ,
Despite the loss by Nguyen
and Sulahian, Michigan earned
the doubles point for the seventh
match in a row.
Sulahian then won the first
singles match at No. 6 singles
defeating Tania Rice 6-1,66-0. The
next two points went to the Wol-
verines as well, with victories by
junior captain Whitney Taney and
Nguyen.
At No. 1 singles, No. 27 junior
Denise Muresan defeated Pepper-
dine's only ranked player, No. 81
Arianna Colffer, 6-2, 6-3.
After taking the uncoming
weekend off, the Wolverines will
look to win their fifth consecutive
match against in-state rival Michi-
gan State for the first of several Big
Ten Conference matches.
"Any conference match is going
to be important," Bernstein said.
"We'll get back on the courts on
Tuesday and continue to improve.
Each match helps you with seed-
ing, so it's big."

Bauer sets tournament record in Wolverine victory

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Setting a tournament record
and also tying a career-best
score, senior Ashley Bauer led the
Michigan women's golf team to a
win this past weekend at the Rio
Verde Collegiate Invitational. But
she was still not entirely happy
with her performance.
"In the first round, I hit a lot
of greens," Bauer said. "But the
second two rounds, I didn't hit as
many. I think that's usually one
of my strong suits. I can always
make more putts, too. I had a
couple of three putts that cost me
a couple of strokes out there and

that's not acceptable."
Bauer was pleased with the
team's performance over the
three-day tournament, especially
how the Wolverines kept their
composure as Michigan won the
tournament, 14 strokes in front of
the second-place finisher, Minne-
sota.
"It's exciting," Bauer said. "You
know every day, every stroke
counts. That's kind of the mental-
ity that we have right now."
After a disappointing last-place
finish last weekend at the Central
District Tournament in Florida,
the Wolverines were hoping to
move on. And with the dominant
performance they did just that.

"I thought we played really
well," Michigan coach Cheryl
Stacy said. "Especially after play-
ing down in Florida and finishing
last in the tournament. I thought
the girls took that as a motiva-
tional thing and made it work
for them and played really well
here."
The team thrived off of Bauer's
stellar performance. After two
days, Junior Min Yean Tan was
tied for third, but finished tied
for seventh after hitting seven
over par on the third day. Senior
Andrea Ratigan tied for third fin-
ishing 7-over par.
Since Michigan cannot play
outdoors in Ann Arbor, it is forced

to strictly play in tournaments
farther south.
"We shot some good numbers
and those numbers, no matter
where we play, will be competi-
tive," Bauer said. "We'll be out
hitting some golf balls, and hope-
fully the weather will break thin.
You can't promise that, but it is
unfortunate that we can't play on
the grass for a while. We just got
to keep doing what we can, and
make the most of it."
The Wolverines will follow up
this victory in two weeks at the
Mountain View Challenge in Tuc-
son, Ariz. where they hope some
of their luck in Arizona will con-
tinue.
