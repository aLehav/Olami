The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs had their first meeting of 
the winter semester on Monday 
to discuss the Academic Affairs 
Advisory Committee resolution 
to protect faculty from unfair 
demotions.

The 
committee 
discussed 

whether it should endorse the 
AAAC’s resolution regarding 
salary 
cuts 
and 
demotions 

of tenured and tenure-track 
professors. 
This 
resolution 

was written in response to a 
tenured professor receiving a 
notice from their department 
chair that their salary was being 
reduced by 10 percent. Those 
in attendance di d not give any 
identifying details about this 
incident.

According to Dan Sharphorn, 

the former Deputy General 
Counsel of the University of 
Michigan, it is legally acceptable 
to reduce a professor’s salary 
by 10 percent each year for a 
certain amount of years or 30 
percent overall. 

However, 
most 
issues 

involving salary reductions are 
problematic because they do not 
follow due process, said SACUA 
member John Lehman, who is 
also a professor of ecology and 
evolutionary biology.

He and the other AAAC 

members drafted a resolution 
that 
they 
will 
present 
to 

the 
Senate 
Assembly 
— 

the governing body of the 
University 
which 
represents 

the interests and concerns of 
faculty — at its meeting on Jan. 
23. The resolution calls for the 
enforcement of due process 
in situations where salary is 
lowered.

The AAAC is a committee 

of the Senate Assembly, while 
SACUA is its executive branch.

“The 
AAAC 
is 
not 

comfortable with these actions 

that have been taken,” Lehman 
said. “What we are saying is that 
the Senate Assembly hereby 
declares that any reduction to 
an individual faculty member’s 
base academic salary constitutes 
a demotion, and entitles the 
affected faculty member to all of 
due process provisions … We’re 
not saying you can’t do it, you 
just have to follow the bylaws.”

After Lehman’s presentation 

of the resolution, the SACUA 

members 
moved 
into 
a 

discussion 
of 
whether 
or 

not they would endorse the 
resolution 
for 
the 
Senate 

Assembly, attempting to find the 
boundaries of what constitutes a 
demotion.

SACUA Vice Chair Dave 

Wright, 
a 
Business 
School 

professor, said there was a key 
flaw in the recommendation. 
He was concerned with how

The Michigan Department 

of Natural Resources approved 
Ann Arbor’s 2017 deer cull plan 
Friday. Which aims to eliminate 
100 deer over the course of two 
weeks from Jan. 30 to Feb. 13.

This year’s deer management 

program will introduce deer 
sterilization for the first time. 
According to the city, between 
the hours of 3 p.m. and 5 a.m. 
from Jan. 22 to 29, professionals 
from White Buffalo Inc. will 
dart 
doe 
with 
tranquilizers 

to 
conduct 
ovariectomies 
— 

surgical procedures that remove 
ovaries — on them at a temporary 
surgical site.

Every sterilized deer will have 

a numbered ear tag attached to 
it, and one doe from each group 
will be fitted with a radio collar 
to 
track 
migration 
patterns 

and analyze survival rates. The 
program aims to sterilize at least 
50 deer by the end of the week. 

City Councilmember Jason 

Frenzel (D–Ward 1) said the 
sterilization aspect was added 
in response to anti-cull groups, 
which have been demanding

University 
of 

Michigan 
Ross 
School 
of 

Business alumni and former 
classmates, Harry Zhang and 
Leore Avidar, were honored 
on the Forbes 30 Under 30 
rankings under the category 
Enterprise 
Technology 
for 

co-founding 
Lob.com, 
a 

company 
that 
specializes 

in sending physical mail as 
easily as email through a 
suite of application program 
interfaces.

After beginning as an idea 

in 2013, Lob now operates out 
of San Francisco with a team 
of more than 25 individuals. 
According to their website, 
Lob 
creates 
customized 

pieces, sends them on their 
customers’ behalf, helps A/B 
test different variants and 
tracks mail as it’s delivered. 
This occurs all under the idea 
that “sending physical mail 
should be as easy as sending 
email.”

Avidar 
said 
they 
are 

empowering 
developers 
to 

build applications.

“Our goal is to enable 

developers and enterprises to 
build applications that they 
couldn’t previously,” he said.

Prior 
to 
creating 
Lob, 

Zhang, who graduated in 2011, 
began as a product marketing 
manager at Microsoft, where 
he worked as a domain expert 
in direct mail, taking 60 to 90 
days to send out millions of 
pieces of mail at a time.

Avidar, who also graduated 

in 2011, gained experience 
working in the web services 
department at Amazon, where 
he learned how to build and 
sell APIs. At Amazon, Avidar 
said it took 30 seconds to send 
one million emails.

The two domain experts 

were able to combine their 
respective talents in making 
an API similar to Amazon’s, 
which could send physical 
mail as easily as email on an 
automated schedule.

Name to better reflect collaboration between education, research and patient care

The University of Michigan 

Health 
System 
has 
been 

renamed Michigan Medicine 
in an effort to reflect the 
collaboration 
between 
the 

system’s education, research 
and patient care branches.

The new name, which took 

effect on Jan. 9, signifies the 
appointment of a single leader 
of both the University Medical 

School and Medical Affairs for 
the University of Michigan. 
Marschall S. Runge, M.D., will 
serve in that position, putting 
him in charge of both the 
medical school and hospital 
operations.

The name of the University 

Medical School is not changing, 
but it will remain a part of 
Michigan Medicine.

Runge 
is 
dean 
of 
the 

University 
Medical 
School, 

executive vice president for 
medical affairs and CEO of 
Michigan 
Medicine. 
Before 

coming to the University, Runge 
was the executive dean for the 
University of North Carolina 
School of Medicine, a professor 
of medicine at UNC-Chapel Hill 
and chair of the UNC-Chapel 
Hill Department of Medicine.

The University’s Board of 

Regents approved this combined 
position in September, hoping it 
would facilitate more seamless 
implementation of the system’s 
three-part 
mission: 
patient 

care, education and research.

“Becoming 
Michigan 

Medicine 
is 
more 
than 
a 

name 
change,” 
Runge 
said 

in an article from Michigan 
Medicine. “This new name 
reflects a growing trend among 
world-class academic medical 
centers 
to 
showcase 
the 

integration of their missions: 
medical education, health care 
research and patient care.”

Medical 
School 
student 

William 
Froehlich

new name erases the health 
system’s history and tradition,

On 
Monday, 
Gov. 
Rick

legislation 

that will streamline tuition 
assistance for members of the 
Michigan National Guard.

House 
Bill 
6013 
was 

introduced in November to 
the Michigan Legislature and 
sponsored by state Rep. Bruce 
Rendon (R–Lake City). It was 
referred to the Committee on 
Military and Veterans Affairs, 
which reported on the bill 
with recommendation without 
amendment.

In December, the bill was 

referred to the committee on 
Veterans, 
Military 
Affairs 

and Homeland Security, all of 
whom favored the bill without 
amendment, and recommended 
its immediate effect.

The bill seeks to adjust the 

Michigan National Guard State 
Tuition Assistance Program, 
which is housed within the 
state’s Department of Military 
and Veteran Affairs, in assisting 
members of the National Guard 
in paying for higher education.

President-elect Donald 

Trump tweeted appreciation to 

Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler 

Automobiles on Jan. 9 following 

recent announcements by both 

companies to invest in U.S. 

plants.

During the Detroit Auto 

Show, Fiat Chrysler announced 

a $1 billion investment in its 

Warren, Mich. and Toledo, Ohio 

plants by 2020. Fiat Chrysler’s 

plans to make a Jeep pickup and 

resume production of the classic 

Wagoneer is expected to create 

2,000 jobs.

Sergio Marchionne, CEO 

of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, 

warned the company would have 

to close plants if Trump imposed 

a tariff on imports from Mexico.

Ford announced earlier in 

January its plan to expand its 

Flat Rock plant, investing $700 

million and hiring 700 new 

hourly workers to build self-

driving and electric vehicles. 

The plant currently produces 

the Mustang and Lincoln 

Continental. Ford also canceled 

plans to build a $1.6 billion plant 

in San Luis Potosi, 

Mexico.

Trump retweeted 

an article following the 

announcement, which 

indicated the president-

elect’s influence on the 

decision.

Trump won 

Michigan, an 

auto industry 

hub, in November 

with promises to 

revive American 

manufacturing. Earlier 

in his campaign, he 

threatened to impose 

tariffs on cars made 

in Mexico by General 

Motors and repeatedly 

criticized Ford for their 

plants in Mexico.

He expressed gratitude 

to Ford and Fiat Chrysler in a 

tweet, noting his appreciation 

for their 

investment in Michigan 

specifically.

the city explore alternative 
and experimental methods of 
solution.

“One of the concerns that 

was brought up by a number 
of different individuals and 
groups was the city’s lack of 
implementing any non-lethal 
methods,” Frenzel said. “There 
were some groups in town that 
were interesting in pursuing 
that option and this is an attempt 
to go down that road to see if it is 
a workable situation here.”

The cull was highly unpopular 

among many citizens and some 
members of City Council when 
it was first introduced in the 
Fall of 2015. Many Ann Arbor 
citizens expressed concern over 
residents’ safety and the moral 
considerations of implementing 
a cull in the city. However, the 
cull was approved 8-1 by the 
City Council, and a majority of 
residents surveyed were in favor 
of it.

The 
culling 
phase 
also 

received an update, taking last 
year’s data on neighborhood 

safety and deer presence into 
consideration.

Frenzel said updates include 

the shortening of the culling 
period, 
which 
was 
reduced 

from roughly two months to 
two weeks from January 30 
to February 13 from 3 p.m. to 
midnight. The number of parks 
where lethal shooting will take 
place is also reduced because of 
the non-lethal initiative.

“There’s a little bit of shifting 

around of parks,” Frenzel said. 
“(Last year) some of the parks 
were simply too small, some of 
the parks contiguous with other 
parks so it was confusing … and 
there were a couple of locations 
that were used heavily for 
children’s routes to school and 
those were removed.”

There are 10 areas throughout 

the city that will be closed 
during the cull program. Three 
University of Michigan property 
areas will also be closed from 
Jan. 30 to Feb. 2 from 3 p.m. to 
midnight, including the Nichols 
Arboretum.

Tanya Hilgendorf, CEO of 

the Humane Society of Huron 
Valley, who is opposed to the 
deer 
management 
program, 

expressed 
her 
displeasure 

at 
this 
dual 
sterilization-

culling approach. She argued 
that 
the 
city’s 
claim 
of 

deer 
overpopulation 
is 
not 

scientifically valid and is instead 
motivated by residents wanting 
to protect the pristine condition 
of their backyards.

“(We) do not think a mixed 

approach of killing and sterilizing 
makes sense philosophically or 
scientifically,” Hilgendorf wrote 
in an email interview with the 
Daily. “If we don’t think it is 
okay to use gun violence to try to 
solve problems between people 
then we shouldn’t use gun 
violence against wildlife in our 
community parks.”

Hilgendorf 
criticized 
the 

University for opening its land 
up to sharpshooters, arguing 
that it is selfish for the University 
to create a haven for deer and 
then remove them when they 
become a nuisance.

“The UM called the Arb a 

‘living laboratory’ – shouldn’t a 
living laboratory embrace life?” 
Hilgendorf wrote. “We planted 
the tasty plants that deer love 
to eat. We essentially invited 
them to dinner and then became 

outraged when they took up 
our offer. Now they are being 
shot 
and 
going 
through 

surgery just to appease those 
looking for easy answers.”

One 
of 
the 
concerns 

detailed in last year’s deer 
management report was the 
need for better enforcing 
park closing during culling 
hours and a small number 
of anti-cull activists who 
spread 
misinformation 

to create “alarm” among 
residents.

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

(D) said he does not believe 
a misinformation campaign 
is going on, but rather that 
residents are interpreting 
information in a different 
way.

“Whatever 
happened 

last year, I have no reason 
to 
believe 
that 
there’ll 

be 
people 
spreading 

misinformation this year,” 
Taylor said. “People get their 
information from a variety 
of ways. I have no reason to 
think that it’s an intentional 
campaign.”

its 
National 
Guard 
Tuition 

Assistance Program in 2014 by 
creating a tuition fund within 
the state treasury, capped at 
$10 million.

Despite 
these 
efforts 
to 

improve 
education 
funding 

for members of the Michigan 
National Guard, the program 
introduced in 2014 struggled 

with red tape complexities. 
According to Brig. Gen. Michael 
Stone, 
assistant 
adjutant 

general for installations of the 
Michigan Army National Guard, 
a 
multitude 
of 
obstructing 

steps were necessary in order 
to approve tuition assistance 

for members of the Michigan 
National Guard.

The signed bill, which is now 

Public Act 531 of 2016, amends 
the current program to expand 
the financial discretion of the 
Department of Military and 
Veterans Affairs. The Michigan 
National 
Guard 
Tuition 

Assistance Fund can distribute 
money to either an individual 
member 
of 
the 
National 

Guard or his or her academic 
institution.

Under the new legislation, 

Maj. Gen. Gregory Vadnais, 
adjutant general and director of 
Military and Veterans Affairs 
for 
the 
Michigan 
National 

Guard, 
has 
the 
power 
to 

allocate money directly to an 
individual’s institution. The act 
limits lengthy administrative 
obstructions that previously 
hindered 
members 
of 
the 

Michigan National Guard from 
receiving timely educational 
funding.

“The 
changes 
essentially 

allow us to pay the school 
directly, 
which 
increases 

efficiency,” Stone said. “The 
new 
language 
increases 

efficiency 
and 
reduces 

manpower by eliminating the 
middle person in the process. 
A Michigan Guard member can 
complete an online application 
and have tuition paid directly 
to his or her school.”

The 
Michigan 
National 

Guard State Tuition Program 
may 
now 
award 
soldiers 

and airmen of the Michigan 
National Guard up to $600 per 
credit hour with a $6,000 cap 
at nearly all Michigan public or 

private universities, vocational 
schools, tech schools or trade 
schools.

“Those who serve to defend 

and protect our state deserve 
the ability to also reach their 
academic 
goals,” 
Snyder 

said. “This bill gives greater 
flexibility 
to 
the 
National 

Guard Tuition Assistance Fund 
in order to provide tuition 
assistance to those who bravely 
serve their state and nation.”

LSA 
junior 
Colin 
Kelly, 

president of the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, 
said 
because 
of 
the 

straightforward nature of this 
legislation, 
the 
organization 

did not wish to comment.

LSA 
student 
Audrey 

Carlstrom has been in the 
Michigan Air National Guard 
since Dec. 2013, and has been 
a 
full-time 
student 
at 
the 

University since Jan. 2014. 
Carlstrom said she had never 
applied for tuition aid until this 
semester.

“Before now I never applied 

because I never thought I 
qualified even though I had read 
the requirements,” Carlstrom 
said. “I’m not fully aware of the 
new changes to be honest, but 
in the past I’ve felt disqualified 
before even trying because of 
the limited benefits of the state, 
the university I attend, and the 
federal I receive through the GI 
Bill and the state.”

in building up these tools,” 
Avidar said. “We would create 
a script using the tool that we 
had built then we would send 
it out. So that was kind of the 
‘aha’ moment. We were like, 

‘hey, let’s build the exact same 
tool that Amazon has built but 
for a different medium.’ ”

Avidar said the company 

made 
over 
$9 
million 
in 

revenue last year and has 
received over $29 million in 
funding since its inception.

“So we are providing them a 

toolkit,” Avidar said. “The best 
metaphor that I can say is that 
most people were using pen 
and paper beforehand, and 
we’re providing the new age 
calculator to the developer.”

Avidar said being honored 

by Forbes was a validation of 
Lob as a company, but won’t 
change 
their 
day-to-day 

operations going forward.

“It’s not really a recognition 

of myself, because I’m not a 
sole builder of Lob,” Avidar 
said. 
“So 
it’s 
more 
of 
a 

recognition for my team. What 
it means is that my team has 
done a great job building the 
company over the last three 
and a half years. I have a team 
that’s dedicated to a really 
important mission. I think it’s 
just validation for our team 
and validation for our idea. It 
will build more trust for the 
customers deciding whether 
or not to use Lob.”

Avidar credited a lot of his 

and his company’s success to 
his ties with the University of 
Michigan, where he met Zhang 
in the Business School. Avidar 
and Zhang reunited in Seattle, 
where they continued not only 
their business endeavors, but 
their friendship.

“He was the first person I 

reached out to,” Avidar said. 
“Me and him grew very close 
when I was there; we have the 
same interests. We both have 
the business acumen. We both 
respect each other as people. 
He has led us to get amazing 
companies at Lob.”

Zhang 
leads 
Sales 
and 

Marketing, and has been able 
to gain access to companies 
such as Microsoft, Amazon 
and Square.

Avidar said the four core 

members of Lob met while 
attending 
the 
University. 

Avidar 
stressed 
the 

importance of working closely 
with people in college because 
you might again in the future.

“The Michigan ties are 

huge,” Avidar said. “Don’t 
underestimate the people you 
went to school with or the 
person that sat next to you 
in class. You never know, one 
day you might be starting a 
company with them. I am 
building a company, but at 
the same time it feels like 
me working with a bunch of 
friends.”

The 
Business 
School 

also 
made 
a 
statement 

congratulating 
the 
two 

businessmen.

“Congratulations 
to 
two 

Michigan Ross alumni, Leore 
Avidar 
and 
Harry 
Zhang, 

BBA ‘11, on being honored on 
Forbes’ annual ‘30 Under 30’ 
list,” the statement read.

Avidar said there is a new 

API being released in March 
and another at the end of 
the year, with the long-term 
mission being to create a 
suite of APIs for companies to 
choose from.

“We want to show that we 

are the best at building and 
selling APIs,” Avidar said. 
“It’s empowering to our team 
that we hit a milestone and we 
can celebrate it. But we have 
many more milestones that we 
need to achieve. It’ll push us 
to our next milestone.”

Business School Dean Scott 

DeRue wrote in an email 
interview 
he 
believes 
the 

success of Avidar and Zhang 
demonstrates the benefits of 
a business education at the 
University.

“We’re so proud of Leore and 

Harry for their success with 
Lob.com,” he wrote. “Being 
named to Forbes’ ‘30 Under 
30’ List is an achievement that 
speaks to their outstanding 
creativity, determination, and 
leadership abilities. Leore and 
Harry’s story is a wonderful 
example of Michigan Ross’ 
tradition 
of 
excellence 
in 

entrepreneurship, and it is an 
inspiration for students across 
the University of Michigan 
who also possess bold ideas 
for the future of business.”

theresolution 
dealt 
with 

scenarios 
where 
teaching 

responsibilities were increased 
but salary was not.

“There’s 
another 
way 
to 

reduce 
someone’s 
salary 

effectively, which is to say that 
the base is still the same but your 
teaching load is (increased),” 
Wright said. “This wouldn’t 
catch that.”

This sparked some debate 

within 
the 
committee, 
as 

SACUA member David Smith, 
a professor of pharmaceutical 
sciences, 
disagreed 
with 

Wright’s comment. He felt that 
increasing a professor’s teaching 
load is an acceptable course 
of action for a department to 
take, and does not count as a 
demotion.

“I think it’s legal to give 

people 
more 
responsibilities 

with service or teaching, if, say, 
their research falls down,” Smith 
said. “What (the unwarranted 
salary decreases) seem a clear 
attempt to do, at least to me, is 
to bypass (the bylaw) and make 
it uncomfortable in a financial 
sense for the person to want to 
remain at the University.”

Committee member Silke-

Maria 
Weineck, 
professor 

of 
German 
studies 
and 

comparative 
literature, 

disagreed with Smith’s notion 
that teaching responsibilities 
could be increased to substitute 
for lagging research and felt that 
it in some cases, it could be more 

harmful than a salary decrease.

“Salary 
is 
actually 
much 

more 
fluid 
than 
teaching 

load,” Weineck said. “In some 
disciplines where you publish 
more frequently, you can gauge 
research output more easily, 
but in the humanities, it’s not so 
easy to gauge whether someone 
is doing research.”

Committee member Stefan 

Szymanski, 
a 
Kinesiology 

professor, said the definition 
of a demotion may have to be 
modified. He reasoned that 
the definition of demotion is 
a lowering of status and the 
explanation made by the AAAC 
does not explicitly cover this 
or a salary decrease nor does a 
teaching increase satisfy this 
definition.

Wright 
suggested 
the 

committee revise the resolution 
to broaden the definition of 
demotion 
and 
clarify 
other 

terms regarding the increase 
of 
teaching 
responsibilities. 

However, since the resolution 
was written by the AAAC, 
the new additions had to be 
written in a separate resolution, 
he said. A new resolution was 
quickly written by Weineck and 
presented to the committee.

The two resolutions on the 

table were brought up for vote 
by the committee. The original 
proposal to endorse the AAAC’s 
resolution was passed by SACUA 
by a vote of 4 to 2.

The later resolution to clarify 

the definition of demotion failed 
with a tied vote, but can still be 
brought up independently at the 
Senate Assembly meeting.

the name Michigan Medicine 
encapsulates a more cohesive 
sentiment that could do its 
traditions more justice.

“While it’s less descriptive 

than the very literal old name, 
the name Michigan Medicine 
feels 
more 
like 
a 
brand,” 

Froehlich said. “That could 
make our health system even 
more recognizable.”

The Board also approved a 

new partnership between the 
University and Metro Health in 
Grand Rapids last September. 
Metro Health CEO Michael 
Faas said in an earlier press 

release that partnering with 
the University will add options 
for increased care to Metro 
Health patients, particularly in 
the Grand Rapids community.

“It is no secret that U-M 

has some of the best providers 
in the state and country,” 
Faas wrote in a statement in 
June. “By joining the ‘leaders 
and best’ we can build on our 
existing expertise and provide 
our patients and community 
with 
enhanced 
access 
to 

specialized 
health 
care 

services, scientific discovery 
and advanced technology.”

With its 500 physicians and 

208-bed hospital, Metro Health 
hopes to increase accessibility 
and options for its patients 

through this new relationship. 
Michigan Medicine allows for 
these increased options with 

the University’s three hospitals, 
40 outpatient locations and 
home 
care 
operations 
that 

handle more than 2.1 million 
outpatient visits a year.

According to the Michigan 

Medicine’s press release, Board 
Chair Mark Bernstein (D) said 
the new partnership is evidence 
of the University’s goal to expand 
outside Ann Arbor. Runge agrees, 
believing the new title will fit the 
new health system and its future 
ambitions better.

“We 
expect 
Michigan 

Medicine will help generate 
a better understanding of the 
strengths 
of 
our 
academic 

medical center and will energize 
all our faculty and staff,” Runge 
wrote.

I

’m going to tell you a 
personal anecdote and then 
relate it to an advertisement 

I saw on campus; these two 
things, 
together, 

will help me make 
my point. I promise 
they relate to one 
another. This does 
not mean, despite my 
best wishes to live in 
the world of “maybe 
it’s 
Maybelline,” 

that my life is an 
advertisement. 
If 

my 
life 
were 
an 

advertisement, if any 
of our lives were advertisements, 
we would be fucked. OK?

In the days before our Winter 

Break, I went to the Central 
Campus Recreation Building 
twice. These were my first times 
going to the gym at school. By 
the end of the second trip, I had 
to hold the banister with both of 
my hands as I walked down the 
steps in my cooperative house 
to prevent myself from falling. 
My whole body ached. I began 
to ask myself, “When can I start 
considering myself a ‘gym rat?’ ”

I have a brother who has 

always been more athletic 
than I am, and I was raised by 
two parents who really care 
about their health and their 
bodies. I have never really 
gotten into that whole thing, 
despite their best efforts to 
push me toward the gym.

I recognize this. I recognize 

that by going to the gym a 
couple of times, I am not 
going 
to 
make 
any 
great 

changes to my body or to my 
understanding of myself. This 
work is continuous. It demands 
sustained, unrelenting effort.

After the second of these 

two trips to the gym, I saw an 
advertisement for the University 
of Michigan Bicentennial. It 
contained 
two 
photographs, 

positioned vertically, with one 
above the other. In the top 
photo, taken in black and white, 
five white students sit, looking 
goofy as they eat and drink 
while looking at the camera. 
In the bottom photo, in color, 
two Asian students sit on the 
grass, chatting. Accompanying 
these photographs were the 
words, written in capitalized 
font, “Always Michigan/Forever 
Valiant.”

This advertisement represents 

a vitally destructive mode of 
examining one’s history. The 
caption denies that Michigan 
was ever not “valiant.” For 

example, 
James 

Burrill Angell, the 
longest-standing 
president 
of 
the 

University 
(from 

1871 
to 
1909), 

played a vital role in 
drafting the Chinese 
Exclusion Act, signed 
in 1882. This act 
denied immigration 
to the United States 
by Chinese laborers 

and served as the foundation 
for 
restrictive, 
divisive 

immigration law today.

And yet, we valorize him. 

Most students on this campus 
would only know his name 
because 
one 
of 
our 
most 

illustrious, celebrated buildings 
is named after him. I insist that 
we must reckon with this past 
in order to better understand 
ourselves today. The phrase 
“Always Valiant” denies any 
sense of humility or recognition 
or 
introspection. 
How 
are 

we meant to create a more 
equitable culture today if we do 
not even attempt to understand 
from where we are coming? 
How will we know what is 
wrong, what is evil, if we refuse 
to study it, all in an attempt to 
glorify ourselves? 

Yes, 
the 
University 
has 

taken active strides to combat 
instances of bigotry and hate 
speech on campus. I am serving 
on the student board for the 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
Plan, and I have spoken with 
administrators who genuinely 
care about these issues and, I 
believe, will work in our favor 
for the sake of combatting 
these issues. But why do hate 
crimes happen here? Why do 
racist posters adorn the walls 
of our campus? What are 
the roots of these cancerous 
elements 
which 
are 
given 

space to bubble and thrive on 
our campus? Why are we so 
afraid to study these roots? 
Why do we insist upon our 
eternal, long-lasting sanctity?

I 
posit 
that 
these 
two 

moments 
— 
my 
grappling 

with my understanding of my 
body while going to the gym 
and 
this 
advertisement 
— 

demonstrate the destruction 

that accompanies a presentist 
mindset, a perspective which 
focuses solely on the present 
moment and refuses to reckon 
with its past. Two trips to the 
gym do not change me. And 
contemporary 
advertising 

campaigns 
and 
“initiatives” 

do not change the history of 
this campus. Our past always 
informs our present and our 
future. We must study it in 
order to assure ourselves that 
it does not happen again. The 
threats of a reversion to a less 
equitable world are imminent, 
always looming. For evidence, 
we can use the number of 
hate crimes and instances of 
racism on our campus that 
took place last semester, and 
will, in some form, explicit 
or 
not, 
characterize 
the 

semester that has just begun. 
These forces of hate have not 
been successfully defeated, 
I believe, precisely because 
we have thus far refused to 
engage with our history.

Instead of only focusing on 

moving past these instances of 
hatred, I posit that we study their 
origins, that we understand the 
limitations of our perspective 
— we, a university that glorifies 
and 
celebrates 
Angell, 
also 

honors Clarence Cook Little, 
a prominent eugenicist. Little 
was also a University president, 
as if once one becomes a 
president at our school, they 
achieve a certain undeniable, 
unquestionable 
glory. 
Their 

careers 
of 
working 
toward 

institutional 
division 
and 

hatred are discarded, in order 
to construct an unrealistic, 
ignorant profile, which we can 
subsequently admire.

The solution also does not lie 

simply in changing the names 
of the buildings this University 
has named after these men. That 
would be a move of intentional 
erasure, and this is not what we 
need. Let the names linger for 
some time while we study their 
meanings and their impacts. Let 
them soak in their disgusting, 
soiled, foul history. Let the 
unsullied reputations of these 
men die, through dialogue and 
recognition and consciousness. 

Only then can we move 

forward.

L

ast year, as I sat in 
my organic chemistry 
lecture, 
a 
rather 

disturbing 
thought 
passed 

through my mind: This professor 
could say pretty much anything, 
and I’d believe it.

After much reflection, I’ve 

come to realize this thought 
rests on two premises. First 
is the notion that science, 
as a discipline, consists of 
an 
anthology 
of 
objective, 

unquestionable truths. Second 
is that in order to really 
understand 
these 
truths, 

one must persevere through 
years and years of education, 
slowly but surely garnering 
an understanding for both the 
concepts and the jargon in a 
given field.

These 
two 
premises 

contribute 
to 
the 
student-

teacher dynamic felt in most 
lecture courses: The professor, 
who holds a doctorate degree, 
serves as the end-all-be-all 
reservoir of knowledge for the 
content covered in the course, 
and the hundreds of undergrads 
enrolled in the course sit quietly 
and 
listen, 
absorbing 
this 

information, only interrupting 
for clarification.

This dynamic endangers the 

very future of science.

I’ll admit that though this 

thought dawned on me in 
organic chemistry, I didn’t 
really feel the weight of it 
then. 
Professors 
walked 

through chemistry concepts 
at the same pace students 
took notes. Exam problems 
required students to apply 
concepts, 
presenting 
them 

with novel problems from 
primary 
literature. 
I 
left 

the course feeling as if I had 
gained a solid understanding 
of the principles underlying 
organic chemistry.

It 
wasn’t 
until 
this 

semester, as I sat listening to 
professors rattle off names of 
compounds and processes off 
60-plus slide lectures, being 
told to be able to “recognize” 
them for exams and nothing 
more, that I realized the full 
implications of this professor-
student dynamic.

In a course taught like this 

— where the expectation is 
to memorize terms instead of 
applying concepts or solving 
problems 
— 
students 
feel 

pressure to adhere strictly to 
what the professor presents. 
This results in a class full of 
future doctors, researchers and 
engineers accepting information 
at face value, afraid to challenge 
the 
professor, 
in 
fear 
of 

jeopardizing a grade in a course 
that will grant them a spot in a 
professional or graduate school. 
The course turns into a game 
of memorization, rather than 

an opportunity to understand 
how these facts fit into a greater 
scientific whole.

I 
found 
this 
especially 

problematic during times when 
my professors would contradict 
themselves by saying something 
incompatible 
with 
previous 

content 
presented 
in 
the 

lecture. I struggled with how I 
was supposed to navigate these 
contradictions — was I supposed 
to seek out the “truth,” or accept 
what the professor said as the 
“truth” within the context of 
the course?

But even if students try to 

memorize and regurgitate all 
the information they learned for 
an exam, they don’t necessarily 
secure a good grade in the 
course. According to research 
conducted by University of 
Michigan professors, students, 
on average, performed worse 
in large introductory STEM 
lecture courses than they did 
in courses in other disciplines. 
Though 
all 
students 

experienced this grade penalty, 
female students experienced a 
larger penalty than their male 
counterparts, 
a 
difference 

attributed 
to 
factors 
like 

stereotype threat. I wouldn’t 
be too surprised if research 
revealed 
similar 
findings 

for other minority groups in 
science as well. 

Of course, it may be argued 

that the lower grades are a result 
of the material being “more 
difficult” 
in 
STEM 
courses 

than in other disciplines, but 
difficulty is only one factor 
among many that can adversely 
affect student performance. I’d 
argue that poor grades in these 
types of courses can also arise 
from the lack of a true student-
teacher 
relationship 
due 
to 

class size or the lack of student 
engagement with the course 
material — memorizing facts 
and figures isn’t a particularly 
stimulating task.

However, 
the 
bigger 

implication of these findings is 
that poor grades in these large 
lecture courses discourage key 
groups of people from pursuing 
scientific careers, eliminating 
diversity in science from the 
get-go. The same study found 
that grade penalties against 
women 
were 
not 
present 

in lab courses, which more 
readily resemble the types of 
environments that professionals 
in scientific careers encounter. 
Yet large lecture courses are 
often a student’s first taste of 
science at a collegiate level, and 
I can only imagine how many 
stereotype-threatened 
groups 

(or students from disadvantaged 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds, 

whose schools might not have 
had strong science programs) 
abandon a science major before 
even realizing their prowess in 
the field.

The problems caused by the 

unquestionable 
“objectivity” 

and jargon that characterize 
scientific discourse transcend 
the classroom and render the 
discipline largely inaccessible 
to the general public. Perhaps 
the reason we live amid such 
rampant climate change denial 
is because much of the scientific 
evidence is incomprehensible 
to the average person; that is, 
the average person would likely 
more readily believe political 
pandering about a scientific 
topic than believe that elevated 
carbon dioxide levels in the 
atmosphere are correlated with 
rising temperatures. A similar 
assessment may be made to 
the camps driving antibiotic 
overuse and skepticism toward 
vaccination, two other salient 
issues that may endanger public 
health in the coming decades.

I’m not arguing that we 

should water down science 
education to make it more 
inclusive, but rather that we 
should increase the accessibility 
of scientific ideas by presenting 
them without condescension 
and in a way that fosters inquiry 
rather than blind acceptance.

The former starts with us: 

We mustn’t be so quick to 
dismiss people as unintelligent 
for 
failing 
to 
agree 
with 

scientific evidence that they 
likely 
do 
not 
understand. 

Instead, 
we 
must 
invite 

these people to the scientific 
conversation, 
acknowledge 

their side of the argument 
and give them the resources 
and guidance necessary to 
understand the implications of 
scientific research.

As 
for 
creating 
courses 

that encourage inquiry and 
discussion, departments and 
faculty must work to revise 
curricula in their fields. The 
University already offers some 
courses that accomplish this 
task, such as the Authentic 
Research Connection sections 
of introductory biology and 
chemistry labs, which foster 
an inquiry-based alternative 
to the normal curricula for a 
small group of students each 
semester. REBUILD is also 
working on curricula revision 
across “foundational courses” 
in 
different 
STEM 
fields 

to 
foster 
“active 
learning” 

and make the courses more 
accessible to students of all 
identities. Making this shift 
across all introductory courses 
— 
especially 
large 
lecture 

courses — will undoubtedly 
take much time, thought and 
money, but it is integral for 
the creation of stronger, more 
inclusive science education.

Until 
that 
happens, 

however, students must keep 
thinking critically about the 
“facts” they are presented. 
The future of science depends 
on us, after all.

Making peace with imperfection

ASHLEY ZHANG | COLUMN

M

y AP teachers in 
high school loved 
to 
brag 
that 
we 

were 
undoubtedly 
prepared 

for 
college, 
that 

our educations had 
ingrained 
in 
us 

superb study habits 
and learning skills 
that would put us far 
beyond our college 
peers. Yet, while I do 
believe that my high 
school did a good 
job of preparing me 
and my classmates 
for higher education, 
college was not the walk in the 
park that I’d been promised; 
most of my new peers came just 
as prepared as me, if not more.

I still remember my second 

day of freshman orientation, 
when the College of Engineering 
and School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance students were shuttled 
on a bus to the mysterious 
North Campus that I now call 
home. A histogram of the grade 
point averages of the members 
of the incoming class was 
projected on the screen, heavily 
skewed right — the median was 
a whopping 3.9. Then, the graph 
changed to display the GPAs of 
engineering students after a 
few semesters at the University. 
The difference between the two 
histograms was drastic: The 
graph of engineering students’ 
GPAs after a few semesters at 
the University showed a much 
larger spread with a much 
lower median GPA.

“Most of you breezed through 

high school with a 4.0,” stated 
the adviser, and I looked around 
the room to see a sea of nodding 
heads, my own included. “But 
many of you will find it much 
more difficult to maintain in 
college, and that’s OK.” 

The reaction was not as 

obvious this time, but I suspect 

that many of my new schoolmates 
shared my feelings: I believed 
the statistics, but there was no 
way that I would fall victim to 

them. High school 
had, frankly, been a 
piece of cake for me, 
and I was confident 
that college would be 
no different.

How naive I was. 

Now here I am, a mere 
half-year later with 
a semester under my 
belt and a less-than-
perfect GPA, eating 
my own words. I had 

come to expect my grade earlier 
in the semester as the possibility 
of earning an A diminished with 
each passing exam, but there 
was still something crushing 
about seeing it officially mar my 
transcript: B+. B stands for bad. B 
is a blemish. Bs don’t get you into 
med school (this is a common 
misconception, by the way).

Now, I hadn’t cried about 

my grades since the first test 
I’d failed in AP Chemistry 
way back when, but my voice 
was still tinged with dismay 
when I told my parents about 
my first B. I’m not exactly 
sure what I was expecting, 
but I was surprised when 
they responded without a 
trace 
of 
negativity. 
They 

understood that college was 
a different playing field from 
high school, and a B+ was a 
perfectly acceptable grade.

It 
took 
me 
a 
while 

longer to come to the same 
understanding. In a way, I felt 
like I’d let myself down. I’d 
always excelled at school, and 
some time along the way, I’d 
tied my self-worth to it. When 
I suddenly had to work my ass 
off for the first time and it 
still wasn’t enough, I felt like 
I’d lost something integral to 
my identity.

Winter break was a time 

for reflection, a coming-to-
terms with the past semester. 
If I could describe my first 
semester here in one word, 
I would call it “humbling.” I 
have met some of the best and 
brightest 
people 
here, 
and 

they have taught me so much 
about chemistry, math and 
modesty. I’ve learned that even 
the smartest people I know 
have stumbled academically at 
times, and that a single letter 
should not — and cannot — 
define me. I’ve realized that, 
although 
academics 
should 

be a priority, there is so much 
more to the college experience, 
and it would be a shame to 
waste these four short years 
in the library, worrying about 
maintaining a 4.0.

Though I was disappointed 

to earn a B so early in my 
college career, in a way, I’m 
glad it came this way. The 
Band-Aid 
has 
been 
ripped 

off, the perfection shattered, 
and now I’m free. Rather than 
view my GPA as something 
that’s 
been 
broken 
beyond 

repair, I see it as a burden off 
my back. There is freedom, 
now, to be adventurous with 
my curriculum and dive into 
classes that interest me without 
worrying about their difficulty 
or curve.

As I think back to the 

adviser’s words at freshman 
orientation that I had such 
contempt for a mere six months 
ago, I realize how they resonate 
the truth. Though an imperfect 
GPA had once felt like a death 
sentence for any future I had 
in mind, I’ve come to peace 
with it, and I am — just like the 
adviser predicted — OK.

‘Fences’ hopes to break 
away from theatre roots

Despite Viola Davis’ s strong performance, film adaptation 
of classic August Wilson play falls short of expectations 

Someone give Viola Davis 

an Oscar right now. Right 
now. Don’t even wait until 
February.

The actress, made famous 

by 
her 
role 
as 
Annalise 

Keating on “How to Get Away 
With Murder,” is the shining 
light of the film 
adaptation 
of 

“Fences.” 
The 

power and grit of 
her performance 
as Rose, a 1950s 
Pittsburgh 
housewife, 
is 

unmatched, 
not only in the 
film 
itself, 
but 

in 
this 
entire 

awards 
season. 

She’s 
up 
for 

best 
supporting 

actress at the Golden Globes 
and likely will be for the 
Oscars 
as 
well. 
I 
really 

can’t say enough about her 
performance. She’s perfect. 
We do not deserve Viola Davis.

Denzel Washington (“The 

Magnificent Seven”), who also 
directed the film, has a hard 
time keeping up with Davis. 
He plays Troy Maxom, Rose’s 
husband 
and 
the 
central 

figure in the film. He’s also in 
a uniquely difficult position. 
“Fences” first premiered as a 
play with the same name by 
August Wilson in which Davis 
and Washington previously 
starred. 
The 
most 
iconic 

portrayal of Troy is that by 
James Earl Jones (famous 
for his roles as Darth Vader 
and Michigan hype video 
narrator) 
in 
the 
original 

production of the play. Jones 
won a Tony for the role and set 
the bar impossibly high — at 
least too high for Washington 

to clear.

The plot of the film follows 

Troy as he tries to reconcile 
his past failures and deal with 
his son’s desire to play college 
football 
(played 
by 
Jovan 

Adepo of “The Leftovers”). 
Troy was once a great baseball 
player, but never made it to 
the major leagues, a failure 
he blames on his race. He 
worries the same will happen 
to his son if he tries to make 

it to the NFL, 
so Troy pushes 
him 
away 

from 
sports. 

The 
tension 

and 
conflict 

between 
the 

two 
men 
is 

underdeveloped 
and 
largely 

unexplored, 
which 
is 

disappointing, 
as 
for 
the 

majority of the 

film it is the central source of 
conflict.

But, “Fences” is stuck in 

its theatrical roots. Almost 
all of the action takes place 
in and around the Maxom 
family house. For an almost 
two and a half hour movie, 
visually, it’s boring. Most the 
time, the characters appear in 
medium or long shot, the type 
of view one would have of an 
actor on the stage. The actors, 
most noticeably Washington, 
feel like they’re giving a 
performance for the person in 
the back row who might not be 
able to see or hear — something 
that’s unnecessary in a film. It 
feels, ultimately, like you’re 
watching a recording of a play, 
instead of a film.

As a play, it works. As a 

movie, it’s disappointing in 
its 
unwillingness 
to 
take 

advantage 
of 
its 
medium. 

There’s 
a 
reason 
Denzel 

Washington 
didn’t 
build 

his career on his directorial 
abilities. There are moments in 
“Fences” of real visual beauty, 
but many of the shots are lazy 
— tracking shots lose their 
subjects, the camera switches 
from 
stable 
to 
handheld 

in jarring transitions. The 
editorial and cinematic seams 
are on full display.

The story Washington has 

to work with is incredibly 
rich. August Wilson is a poet 
of the everyday, spinning 
vernacular 
into 
lyrical 

dialogue. He weaves the lives 
of the Maxom family together 
with 
exquisite 
intricacy. 

The transition from stage to 
screen seems to be one of the 
most difficult to make (unless 
you’re Shakespeare, I guess). 
“August: Osage County” is a 
great example of a work that 
excelled as a play and fell 
flat as a film. Unlike literary 
adaptations, with plays there 

is already a visual record of 
the work, so films adapted 
from plays tend to feel more 
like remakes than adaptations. 
“Fences” 
is 
the 
perfect 

example of a stage to screen 
adaptation that falls victim to 
its transition. Unfortunately, 
“Fences” cannot escape its 
origins.

How ‘Bee’ turned meme

FILM NOTEBOOK

Memes 
are 
the 
most 

inexplicable “cultural” products 
of today. What becomes a meme 
is so unpredictable, and it’s that 
randomness which makes them 
so hilarious 
— of course, only if it 

isn’t a “stale” meme. The amount 
of time a meme is relevant ranges 
anywhere from one week to 
nearly three months or longer. 
And, when a meme is deemed old, 
it loses all credibility; it falls to the 
dark depths of meme purgatory. 
In the Fall of 2016, DreamWorks’ 
“Bee Movie” was introduced to 
the honorable ranks of meme-
stardom. Although the meme 
itself has died, its legacy will live 
on forever, inspiring memes for 
months (or weeks) to come.

Memes are not limited to a 

picture captioned with white 
block text in Impact font. In fact, 
this meme style is rather archaic. 
Today, memes can be anything 
from short videos on Vine and 
Instagram to a picture of a 
clenched fist from the childhood 
cartoon “Arthur.” Comic Sans is 
generally the font of choice for 
meme creators. Strangely enough, 
the “Bee Movie” memes tend 

to be edits and mashups of the 
movie itself, like the aptly titled 
YouTube video “The entire bee 
movie but every time they say bee 
it gets faster,” that received an 
astonishing 15 million views — a 
meme miracle.

The 
origins 
of 
the 
“Bee 

Movie” meme are ambiguous. 
By November 2016, it gained 
significant 
momentum 
and 

eventually 
became 
the 
most 

popular 
meme 
on 
the 
web. 

Discovering a meme ahead of the 
curve is like discovering a band 
before they get big. There’s a sense 
of disappointment due to the 
meme, or band, feeling less special 
once everyone knows about it — 
but also pride. “I found this first, 
therefore I’m cool!”

Other similar mashups and 

edits 
of 
“Bee 
Movie” 
have 

been shared on Facebook and 
Instagram. 
According 
to 
the 

meme expert Anthony Fantano 
— more famously known as The 
Needle Drop — the “Bee Movie” 
meme 
is 
“disoriented, 
mind 

altering and almost psychedelic, 
in a way.” Despite there being no 
original content, some amount of 
creativity is still needed to produce 
these mashups. Someone had to 
watch “Bee Movie” and actively 
think about making a meme out of 
it. For this, I applaud the creator, 

whoever this individual may be.

Memes are a godsend for weird, 

awkward internet-forum dwellers 
across the world. That creepy kid 
from high school who sat in the 
back of every classroom drawing 
questionable pictures is now 
probably a virtual star.

Although it’s impossible to tell 

what will become a meme, the 
“Bee Movie” is an ideal candidate. 
It’s not a great movie, but also not 
a terrible movie. It’s not new, but 
old enough to have some amount 
of nostalgic value. To top it all off, 
Jerry Seinfeld (“Seinfeld”) voices 
Barry, the loveable bee who falls 
in love with a human voiced by 
Renée Zellweger (“Bridget Jones’s 
Baby”). Meme culture loves ’90s 
nostalgia, so it only makes sense 
that a movie written by and 
starring Jerry Seinfeld would 
transcend into the meme world.

The mashup style and the 

edited format of the “Bee Movie” 
meme have already impacted 
others. In December, an influx 
of “Star Wars” meme-videos of 
lightsaber fights dubbed with 
random dialogue every time a 
lightsaber collides invaded the 
Internet. Nonetheless, a similar 
meme as popular as the “Bee 
Movie” meme has yet to come, 
and it will be nearly impossible to 
do so.

The Cult of Girlhood

As we grow into ourselves, 

our minds become instruments 
for 
categorization. 
Everything 

becomes 
relational, 
easily 

compared to something else. We 
obsessively classify what we see, 
identifying the people and things 
around us as “this,” but not “that.” 
It helps us make 
sense of a potently 
dynamic world, but 
categorization 
is 

dangerous. It leads 
to pigeonholing and 
expectations of what 
people can and can’t 
be.

Characters 
in 

literature often evade 
these anticipations. 
But the trend of 
disintegrating 
the 
boundaries 

constructed around identity is, for 
me, most openly apparent in books 
that examine girls crossing the 
threshold into womanhood, and 
the causalities that so often occur 
during that in-between state.

Teenage girls are written as 

adrift, beautifully damaged and 
desperately looking for love. The 
difference between typical high 
school romance novels and heart 
wrenching literature is where 
they find this love.

In “The Girls,” the debut novel 

by Emma Cline, protagonist Evie 
Boyd retrospectively reflects on 
her time in a cult in the late 1960s. 
Inspired by the gruesome Manson 
murders, fourteen year old Evie is 
quickly inducted into the swirling, 
dreamy world created by cult 
leader Russell. A charismatic 
narcissist, 
Russell 
surrounds 

himself with runaway teenage 
girls who are mesmerized by his 
nonchalant power.

And yet, the novel barely 

focuses on what the collective 
culture has remained fascinated 
with — the new incarnation 
of Manson in Russell and the 
violence that he was able to incite. 
Cline is much more preoccupied 
with the girls who join him and 
their reasoning, their struggles 
and their dreams.

The reason that Evie enlists 

in the group at all is her instant 
attraction to Suzanne, one of 
the older girls in the cult. Evie 
tolerates Russell, but she is 
instantly and deeply in love with 
Suzanne. Evie explains, in the 
astral prose that surges through 

the novel, “girls are the 
only ones who can really 
give each other close 
attention, the kind we 
equate with being loved. 
They noticed what we 
want noticed.” Russell 
creates 
the 
toxicity 

of 
the 
hallucinatory, 

kaleidoscopic commune 
— none of the members 
have any money, but 
the girls are forced into 
a sexual and emotional 
barter 
system 
when 

interacting with the men who 
frequent the commune. Only 
the girls have any interest in 
constructing a home out of 
the 
commune, 
attempting 
to 

create a semblance of a domestic 
atmosphere. The girls all “share” 
Russell, emotionally and sexually, 
and some have children who 
live with them as well. Though 
the girls are still close to being 
children themselves, they act with 
the weight of adulthood on their 
shoulders. Evie, Suzanne and 
the other girls must constantly 
balance 
their 
burgeoning 

sexuality 
with 
the 
imposed 

humiliation of their desire; they 
must cope with their uneasy 
feelings about their supposedly 
harmonious, 
unconventional 

living situation.

While I read “The Girls,” I 

couldn’t help but think of another 
book in which a band of sisters 
gathered to be more than what 
anyone thought they possibly 
could be. In Jeffrey Eugenides’ 
“The 
Virgin 
Suicides,” 
the 

Lisbon sisters, beautiful, blonde, 
and 
perpetually 
unattainable, 

personify teenage angst. Another 
retrospective novel told from 
the perspective of the currently 
middle aged male worshippers 
of the Lisbon sisters, “The Virgin 

Suicides” allows the men to 
indulge their nostalgia and try to 
figure out what went wrong. Why 
did these hauntingly beautiful 
girls, bored in their pastel suburbia 
of Grosse Point, Michigan, kill 
themselves?

In “The Virgin Suicides,” the 

boys eventually steal the diaries of 
one of the sisters, in an attempt to 
get in their minds. The boys never 
actually speak to the girls — all 
communication is done through 
music played over a telephone or 
notes left around town.

The boys begin to realize how 

much they don’t understand about 
the Lisbon sisters, explaining, “we 
felt the imprisonment of being a 
girl, the way it made your mind 
active and dreamy, and how you 
ended up knowing which colors 
went together. We knew that 
the girls were our twins, that we 
all existed in space like animals 
with identical skins, and that they 
knew everything about us though 
we couldn’t fathom them at all. 
We knew, finally, that the girls 
were really women in disguise, 
that they understood love and 
even death, and that our job was 
merely to create the noise that 
seemed to fascinate them.” These 
teenagers only have ideas of each 
other, but also only have ideas of 
themselves. It takes reading the 
novel as an adult to see how much 
is a purported, assumed identity; 
none of them actually understand 
themselves or the world around 
them, but being a teenager makes 
you good at faking it.

So what does it mean to 

be a teenager, in print and in 
life? Is it the blatant defiance 
of 
categorization, 
the 
ability 

to 
contain 
multiplicities 
and 

contradictions 
without 
being 

concerned about an identity that 
makes sense? I don’t know. I 
think it’s the way that everything 
becomes saturated with meaning, 
how people and places and words 
and colors ring through your brain 
without a purpose. I wonder if we 
would continue this concentrated 
significance to adulthood if we 
could. But it might hurt too much.

‘One Day’ a decent revival

As a new series ringing in the new 

year, Netflix’s “One Day at a Time” 
ponders the teenage experience 
and celebration of family in a 
revival of the classic 1975 series 
of the same name. 
While 
the 
term 

“reboot” may be used 
to describe many 
throwback 
series, 

“revival” is the more 
accurate term for 
“One Day at a Time” 
— though the sitcom 
may be reminiscent 
of its namesake, it’s 
exclusively one of a 
kind.

The series opens on the Alvarez 

family, 
a 
Cuban-American 

household that struggles to find 
balance between dueling cultures. 
In a classic battle of the ages, 
Justina Machado (“The Purge: 
Anarchy”) 
portrays 
Penelope, 

a recently divorced single mom 
juggling the trials of divorce, work 
and, of course, teenage hormones. 
As hard as Penelope works to 
raise her children in a world of 
opportunity, her children push 
back harder, with technology 
and 
left-wing 
viewpoints. 

Opinions are more specifically 
propagated by Elena (Isabella 
Gomez, “Matador”), Penelope’s 
feminist teenage daughter who 
refuses to participate in her own 

“quinceañera,” a coming-of-age 
party for 15-year old girls, as she 
feels 
the 
cultural 
celebration 

is rooted in misogyny. These 
generational arguments, both with 
equally compelling points, are 
ultimately what drives this series 
and makes it so captivating.

What’s so interesting about 

“One Day at a 
Time” 
is 
that 

their 
arguments 

are 
never 
idle 

bickering. Rather, 
they 
are 
deep 

conversations that 
ponder the larger 
issues of money, 
race and class. So 
while 
Penelope 

might 
push 
for 

her 
daughter’s 

appreciation 
of 
her 
Cuban 

heritage, Elena equally fights for 
recognition as a modern feminist. 
All the while, “abuela” Lydia 
(Rita Moreno, “West Side Story”) 
and shopaholic son Alex (Marcel 
Ruiz, “Snowfall”) balance out the 
mother and daughter with antics 
of their own. While Lydia serves 
as a reminder of the family’s Cuban 
heritage, Alex is a reminder of the 
economic struggle and how they’ve 
persevered over the years, despite 
lacking a prominent father figure. 
From talks of antidepressants to 
the war in Afghanistan, this revival 
is taking a modern spin to the 
American family.

Looking back on the pilot 

episode, one can see that “One Day 

at a Time” succeeds where “Fuller 
House” falls short — capturing that 
old-school sitcom vibe without 
falling into cheesy material. While, 
at times, some aspects tread that 
thin line, this reboot focuses on 
family struggles more than pulling 
some quick laughs. One of the few 
weaknesses lies in the hipster 
landlord Schneider (Todd Grinnell, 
“Nesting”), who offers advice to 
Penelope’s children with a side-
dish of cool attitude and urban 
slang that falls short of convincing 
and moves straight into the realm 
of awkwardness. Even if this is the 
character trait the series is pulling 
for, the lines are often overzealous 
in delivery, breaking the sincerity 
of the series with an inward cringe.

Overall, the Alvarez family is 

dynamically different from the 
family of Netflix’s recent revival 
of the “Full House” series. Not 
only in race, but in the dynamics 
of a working American family, 
struggling to make ends meet from 
day to day. With an unapologetic 
look inside the modern family and 
the struggles of cultural heritage 
and appreciation, “One Day at a 
Time” is plunged back onto our 
screens as a driving force in the 
world of sitcoms. Although there 
is still the fluffiness of a sitcom 
present in Netflix’s revival, the 
touch of reality makes “One Day at 
a Time” unique and well-worth the 
watch.

The first season of “One Day at a 

Time” is currently streaming in its 
entirety on Netflix.

“We are culture. Rap is the 

new rock ‘n’ roll. We are the 
rock stars.” —Kanye West

From Karl Kani and Cross 

Colours 
to 
Rocawear 
and 

Fubu, the hip-hop community 
has been involved in fashion 
since before its emergence into 
the mainstream. The birth of 
modern streetwear, and the 
ability for brands like Supreme 
to coexist with brands like 
Ralph Lauren, have artists like 
Damon 
Dash, 

Jay 
Z, 
Puff 

Daddy, 
and 

many 
others 

to thank. Even 
though 
these 

brands 
have 

their 
origins 

as 
early 
as 

1989, it wasn’t 
until 
recently 

that 
rappers 

were able to 
break into the 
high-fashion 
world. Designer fashion is a 
completely 
different 
beast 

from brands started in houses 
and garages. Something that 
goes 
along 
with 
designer 

brands is the idea of status: 
when 
a 
customer 
buys 

something from Louis Vuitton, 
they are not always buying 
it for the pattern itself, but 
rather because the pattern 
says 
something 
about 
the 

quality of their life. Brands 
like Gucci and Versace are 
considered to be high class, 
and hip-hop artists have long 
been considered to be of a 
lower class than designers, 
its the concept of old-money 
vs. new-money. Things have 
long been this way, but are 
beginning to change. Rappers 
are finally entering into the 
fold with regard to designer 
fashion. It’s long overdue.

It really was not until late 

2008 when an artist like 
Pharrell was able to have a 
jewelry 
collaboration 
with 

Louis 
Vuitton. 
That 
was 

quickly followed up by the 
brand’s 
2009 
collaboration 

with Kanye West. Still today, 
only 
a 
few 
houses 
have 

admitted their influence and 
appeal 
to 
hip-hop 
culture 

(Rousteing 
and 
Tisci 
at 

Balmain and Givenchy come to 
mind). 2016 has been a much-
needed year for hip-hop stars 
further disrupting the fashion 
industry. To highlight a few, 
A$AP Rocky was named as one 
of the faces of Dior Homme’s 
FW16 campaign (and has had 
successful collaborations with 
J.W. Anderson and GUESS), 
Young Thug and Frank Ocean 
were 
shown 
modeling 
for 

Calvin 
Klein, 

and 
Travis 

Scott appeared 
in 
a 
Yves 

Saint Laurent 
video. 
Saint 

Laurent under 
Hedi 
Slimane 

was 
often 

criticized 
for 

having a very 
whitewashed 
runway show. 
His 
Spring/

Summer 
15 

show 
featured 
one 
black 

model, who was essentially in 
a Jimi Hendrix costume, and 
they have not had many more 
since. So, Scott’s appearance 
in the video was a much-
welcomed surprise.

The 
fashion 
world 
is 

changing: 
Internet 
forums, 

Instagram, and other sites 
are 
becoming 

an 
integral 

platform 
for 

sharing what’s 
popular 
in 

fashion around 
the 
world. 

Consumers 
are 
taking 

cues from hip-
hop 
artists 

and 
buying 

into the status 
association 
of 

wearing 
the 

same thing as 
Kanye or A$AP 
Rocky. Looking back at last 
year, 
the 
biggest 
question 

I’m left with is this: Why 
haven’t more designer houses 
taken cues from Balmain and 

Givenchy to work with hip-
hop artists?

Mainstream 
popularity 

drives business, and there’s no 
denying that hip-hop qualifies 
as mainstream. One of the 
most pervasive themes in hip-
hop is the idea of conspicuous 
consumption 
and, 
whether 

designers like it or not, these 
artists are ambassadors for 
the brands and are driving 
sales. It makes sense to me to 
use them as a marketing tool. 
It’s instantly visible when I’m 
browsing sites like Grailed for 
clothes and I see a picture of a 
highly coveted item worn by 
Kanye, or Rocky being used 
as a selling point. It is hard 
for me to not think about how 
many extra wallets and bags 
are sold when Lil Uzi Vert raps 
“Hunnid bands on the Goyard” 
in his song, “Of Course We 
Ghetto 
Flowers,” 
or 
how 

many more people looked-
up 
the 
mentioned 
brands 

when Rocky says “I see your 
Jil Sanders, Oliver Peoples/
Costume National, your Ann 
Demeulemeester” on “Fashion 
Killa” and then proceeded to 
save up for a pair of shades or 
boots.

To 
me 
it 
sounds 
like 

unrequited 
love: 
Loving 

something so much, only for 
it to not feel the same. That’s 
the relationship between hip-
hop 
and 
designer-fashion 

in the world today. It comes 

down to class, 
like I previously 
mentioned: 
In 

the 
world 
of 

high-fashion, 
the 
hip-hop 

community 
is 

still 
viewed 

by many as a 
dangerous other. 
While 
I 
don’t 

know what the 
solution 
here 

is, it’s time for 
major 
fashion 

houses 
to 

recognize 
that 

they are cannibalizing their 
own sales by continuing to 
marginalize such a successful 
group of customers and all of 
their fans.

Hamilton to reportedly join coaching staff

According 
to 
several 

reports, 
current 
Cleveland 

Browns assistant head coach 
and quarterbacks coach Pep 
Hamilton 
is 
joining 
Jim 

Harbaugh and the rest of the 
Michigan coaching staff as the 
new assistant head coach and 
passing game coordinator. 

Ian Rapoport of NFL.com first 

reported Saturday that Hamilton 
was “weighing a departure” 
from the Browns to join the 
Wolverines. 
One 
day 
later, 

Rapoport tweeted that Harbaugh 
had been “telling recruits for a 
few days” that Hamilton would 
be coming to Michigan.

Steve Lorenz of Wolverine 247 

also told The Daily on Sunday that 
he was expecting Hamilton to join 
the staff before Adam Schefter of 
ESPN tweeted Monday night that 
Hamilton accepted Michigan’s 
coaching offer. Mary Kay Cabot 
of Cleveland.com confirmed that 
Hamilton had taken the offer as 
well. 

Meanwhile, 
Hue 
Jackson, 

head coach of the Browns, 
told reporters on a conference 
call Sunday that he “felt very 
comfortable that Pep is staying.”

“I have known about the Jim 

Harbaugh situation from a week 
and a half ago,” Jackson said, 
according to the Browns’ official 
website. 
“... 
Anything 
can 

happen. We want him to stay. 
We hope he stays. Like I said, a 
young man is entitled to do what 
they feel is best for them, but 
I’d think we’ve created a good 
environment and I hope things 
are still good. As far as I know, 
things are.”

This would not be the first 

time Hamilton has coached with 
Harbaugh — he was a part of 
Harbaugh’s staff at Stanford in 
2010, where he served as the wide 
receivers coach. 

Hamilton’s arrival in Ann 

Arbor would help to fill the staff 
vacancy created by Jedd Fisch’s 
departure from the program, 
as 
he 
recently 
accepted 
a 

position as the 
new 
offensive 

coordinator for 
UCLA.

It 
appears 

Hamilton would 
be a perfect fit 
to replace Fisch, 
who 
served 

as 
Michigan’s 

quarterbacks 
coach, 
wide 

receivers coach 
and passing game coordinator. 
Hamilton 
has 
significant 

experience 
coaching 
both 

positions, as he has served as 
an 
offensive 
coordinator 
at 

numerous stops throughout his 
career. Like Fisch, Hamilton 

would bring a unique blend of 
experience at both the collegiate 
and professional level.

Hamilton began his career 

at Howard University, where 

he served as the 
quarterbacks 
coach and later 
as the offensive 
coordinator 
before 
moving 

on 
to 
the 

professional 
level — coaching 
with the New 
York Jets, San 
Francisco 
49ers 
and 

Chicago Bears. He returned to 
college football in 2010 to join 
Harbaugh’s staff at Stanford.

Under 
Hamilton, 
Cardinal 

receivers combined for 129 catches 
for 2,026 yards and were part of an 
offense that scored 40.3 points per 

game that year, making Stanford 
the ninth-ranked offense in the 
nation.

After Harbaugh’s departure 

from 
the 
program 
following 

the 2010 season, Hamilton took 
over as the Cardinals’ offensive 
coordinator for the next two years. 
With Hamilton in that position, 
Stanford’s 
offense 
averaged 

43.2 and 27.9 points per game, 
respectively, in 2011 and 2012, 
before he left for the NFL once 
again.

Before his current stint with 

the Browns, Hamilton was the 
offensive coordinator for the 
Indianapolis Colts, calling plays 
for former Stanford players 
Andrew Luck and Coby Fleener. 
He joined the Browns after 
being fired by the Colts in 2015.

This is a developing story. Stay 

tuned with The Daily for updates.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will reportedly be reunited with his former wide receivers coach in Pep Hamilton.

Notebook: Michigan missing pieces before Minnesota

The Michigan hockey team 

has yet to play a game with its full 
roster at its disposal.

For the entire fall semester, 

sophomore 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody 
was 
academically 

ineligible, leaving the Wolverines 
without 
one 
of 
their 
best 

returning players. When Marody 
finally returned at the Great Lakes 
Invitational on Dec. 29, sophomore 
defenseman 
Joseph 
Cecconi 

departed for Canada to play in the 
World Junior Championships.

This weekend, when Michigan 

travels to face No. 9 Minnesota, it 
will again be left shorthanded.

This time, though, a new 

batch of injuries are plaguing the 
Wolverines. Freshman forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
re-aggravated 

a shoulder injury in Michigan’s 
game against Michigan State at 
the GLI and has not practiced 
since.

Lockwood is currently leading 

the team in points this season, 
and is perhaps the Wolverines’ 
most dangerous offensive threat. 
And given that the Golden 
Gophers’ home rink is Olympic-
sized — 15 feet wider than 
the typical NHL-sized rink — 
Michigan will miss Lockwood’s 
speed and quickness even more 
than 
it 
usually 

would.

“He’s 
one 
of 

our best players, 
so definitely we’re 
going to miss him,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach 
Red 

Berenson. 
“Now 

Cooper (Marody) 
is back, and we’ve 
got to get him 
going and get that 
line going, but, yeah, we’ve got to 
get Will Lockwood back. And the 
sooner, the better.”

In 
addition 
to 
Lockwood, 

Michigan will also be without 
freshman defenseman Christian 
Meike, who injured his knee prior 

to the GLI. While Meike hasn’t 
played nearly as large of a role 
as Lockwood — only appearing 
in three games this season — 

his 
absence 

certainly 
won’t 

help.

Cecconi 

returns

Michigan 

does get some 
good 
news 

in 
terms 
of 

personnel. 
Cecconi 
will 

make 
his 

return 
to 
the 

Wolverines after winning the 
World Junior Championship with 
the United States team.

While Cecconi is only in his 

sophomore season, he has proven 
to be one of the most consistent 
players on the team. And with 

him gone, Michigan was forced to 
play freshmen defensemen Griffin 
Luce and Luke Martin. Though 
the two have played often for the 
Wolverines this season, bringing 
Cecconi back will be a welcome 
sight, because of his consistency.

“He’s one of our steadiest 

defenseman,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“I’d say he’s a solid, defensive 
defenseman. He stays at home, 
blocks shots, kills penalties, 
he’s got a smart stick, he’s hard 
to play against and he’s just one 
of those elements that you can’t 
just replace him with another 
player.

“He’s only a sophomore, but he’s 

taken big strides in his freshman 
year and then into his sophomore 
year. So he’s a key guy. (Associate 
Head Coach) Billy Powers runs 
the defense, and he really trusts 
Joseph to do the right thing at the 

right time, and he puts him in key 
situations.”

Cecconi isn’t necessarily a big 

offensive producer for Michigan, 
but with him back the defense will 
be getting an upgrade, along with 
a bit of depth, which is especially 
pertinent with the loss of Meike.

Goaltending 
battle 
gets 

interesting again

When Michigan traveled to 

Penn State earlier this season, 
it 
did 
so 
without 
freshman 

goaltender Hayden Lavigne, who 
was sidelined with an illness. At 
that time, Lavigne was ranked 
first nationally in goals-against 
average, and had begun solidifying 
himself as the best goaltender on 
the Wolverines’ roster.

Since 
then, 
Lavigne 
has 

returned. And in that time, he 
hasn’t been quite as stout as he 
was before the illness. In his first 

game back, he was shelled by 
Wisconsin, allowing six goals in 
just two periods. He then gave 
up two goals to Michigan Tech 
in the semifinals 
of the GLI before 
being 
replaced 

by senior Zach 
Nagelvoort 
the 

next game against 
the Spartans.

“I’d 
hate 
to 

say 
anyone’s 

in 
the 
lead,” 

Berenson said of 
the 
goaltending 

competition. 
“I 

think we still have confidence in 
all three of them. I think any one 
of them can go out and win us a 
game. I don’t know if anyone has 
been as consistent as we’d like, 
but they’ve all shown that they 
can help our team.”

While 
goaltenders 
haven’t 

been the issue this season for 
Michigan, it will be interesting 
to see if Berenson and his staff 
choose to stick with Lavigne in 
the future.

Sanchez 
gets 
first-line 

opportunity again

When the Wolverines took on 

Michigan State in their second 
game of the GLI, they were coming 
off of a shutout loss. As a result, 
Michigan’s lines were changed 
somewhat drastically.

One of the beneficiaries of 

that shift was freshman forward 
James Sanchez. Prior to the 
game 
against 
the 
Spartans, 

Sanchez had spent most of the 
year playing on the third and 
fourth lines for the Wolverines. 
But the changes yielded success, 
as Michigan tallied five goals 
with the first line of Sanchez, 
Marody and senior forward Alex 
Kile being responsible for two of 
them.

Sanchez finished the game with 

only one assist, but the overall 
offensive success was enough for 
Berenson to give him another 
chance. He says that Sanchez will 
once again be playing with Marody 
and Kile against Minnesota.

“I think he’s got the offensive 

instincts,” 
Berenson 
said. 

“Hockey’s a game of, it’s not X’s 
and O’s, it’s a game of anticipating. 

It’s 
like 
they 

used to say about 
Gretzky. 
‘He 

knows 
what 

you’re going to do 
with puck before 
you 
know.’ 
He 

would go there 
and he would get 
there before the 
puck got there, 
and then he would 
get it.

“I think James, he’s not Gretzky, 

but James has an awareness. Like 
he anticipates well, and then he 
has decent hands with puck. He 
can make a good play, he can play 
with good players, and I think he’s 
going to become a good player.” 

Freshman forward Will Lockwood, the Wolverines’ leading scorer, will be sidelined against the Golden Gophers after 
re-aggravating a shoulder injury at the Great Lakes Invitational in a matchup against Michigan State on Dec. 29

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily

Freshman forward Will Lockwood has had an impressive start to his career, scoring seven goals in 18 games to lead the Wolverines in points.

He’s one of our 
best players, so 
definitely we’re 
going to miss him

Michigan looking for answers after slow start 

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team is three games 
into its Big Ten season, and there 
are already questions swirling 
about the Wolverines’ (1-2 Big 
Ten, 11-5 overall) conference fate 
this season.

Projected to be a relatively 

average team before the year 
began, Michigan made a fairly 
big impression instead, going 
10-3 in non-conference play 
and capturing a 2K Classic 
championship in New York City. 
Aside from obvious hiccups at 
South Carolina, against Virginia 
Tech and at then-No. 2 UCLA, 
the 
Wolverines 
combined 
a 

recalibrated 
defense 
with 

emerging offensive options to 
notch a double-digit win tally — 
a majority of which were decided 
by at least 20 points.

Sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson have played 
the role of breakout starters, 
taking the place of the expected 
pair of seniors Duncan Robinson 
and Mark Donnal. Wagner and 
Wilson have burst onto the scene 
in full force, averaging 11.9 points 
and 10.3 points, respectively, and 
serving as a reliable combination 
of big men. Robinson and Donnal, 
meanwhile, have become dual 
sixth men, boosting Michigan 
with a strong dose of energy 
and effort off the bench while 
averaging 8.8 and six points, 
respectively. 

The cast of characters fit their 

parts and created a cohesive 
unit that steamrolled its non-
conference opponents, though 
admittedly they weren’t elite 
foes. But Big Ten play has been 
an entirely different story.

The first two weeks of the 

conference season have been 
filled 
with 
surprises 
across 

the board. Notably, Minnesota 
already has more wins and 
Indiana already has almost as 
many losses as they had all of 

last year with three and two, 
respectively. 
What 
is 
most 

striking about the situation the 
Wolverines find themselves in 
is just how easily it could be so 
different.

In 
a 
seven-day 
span, 

Michigan 
faced 
off 
against 

Iowa on the road and Penn 
State and Maryland at home. 
In falling 86-83 in overtime to 
the Hawkeyes and 77-70 to the 
Terrapins on opposite ends of 
a 72-69 win over the Nittany 
Lions, the Wolverines revealed 
a 
crucial 
flaw 
that 
could 

potentially determine their fate 
this season. 

“The edge that a lot of great 

teams have has been lacking 
in some games, and there’s no 
way we can win without that 
edge,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “There’s just no way.”

In Iowa City, the outcome of 

the game may have gone down 
to the wire, but Michigan had set 

the tone much earlier, and not in 
a good way. While Iowa notched 
a 53.3 shooting percentage from 
the floor in the first half, the 
Wolverines made just 40 percent 
of their shots. Michigan had 
Wilson 
and 
his 

19 points in the 
stanza to thank 
for keeping the 
Wolverines within 
three 
at 
the 

halftime break.

While Michigan 

turned the tables 
on the Hawkeyes 
in the second half, 
rediscovering 
its 
shooting 
stroke 
with 
a 

51.6 shooting percentage, key 
defensive mistakes and late-
game mismanagements downed 
the Wolverines in overtime. It 
didn’t help that they couldn’t 
stop Iowa guard Peter Jok from 
going off for 25 points, including 
four threes. Not even Wilson’s 

career day of 28 points and 14 
rebounds could save Michigan in 
the end.

When 
the 
Wolverines 

returned to Ann Arbor to take on 
Penn State, they brought those 

shooting 
woes 

back with them. 
Struggling 
to 
establish 

itself early in 
the 
ballgame, 

Michigan 
shot 

42.3 
percent 

from the floor 
and 
knocked 

down 
just 

one 
3-pointer 

on 10 attempts. The offense 
looked stagnant all half, as the 
Wolverines failed to spread the 
floor, move the ball and make 
good decisions. Beilein could 
be seen on the sideline growing 
more and more irritated every 
time a low-percentage shot went 
up early in the shot clock, only to 

clank off the rim and bounce out.

It took until the halfway 

mark of the second stanza 
for 
Michigan 
to 
turn 
its 

fortunes around. Following an 
impassioned speech from senior 
wing Zak Irvin at the media 
timeout, the Wolverines put 
together a 20-6 run kicked off by 
a quick five points from Robinson 
and punctuated by an alley-oop 
slam from Wilson to take the 
lead. Irvin then put his money 
where his mouth was, pairing 
with 
senior 
guard 
Derrick 

Walton Jr. to score Michigan’s 
final 10 points and close out the 
comeback victory.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

managed to pull out the win in 
the end, it very easily could have 
gone the other way, a fact that 
was apparent to the team the 
following day.

“We gotta have that sense of 

urgency from the tip, and it can’t 
be a reaction to going down,” 

Robinson said. “I think we’ve 
done it well some games. … But 
it’s gotta be an everyday mindset, 
every game mindset.”

Less than 72 hours after that 

grand escape, Michigan put 
itself in the position of needing 
to replicate the feat against 
Maryland. 
While 
posting 

another 
40-percent 
shooting 

performance in the first half, the 
Wolverines also let the Terrapins 
bully them around in the paint. 
They fell behind by nine points at 
the break — the largest halftime 
margin of the three games.

Over the course of the second 

half, Michigan attempted to 
generate 
enough 
momentum 

to mount a second straight 
comeback. 
Scratching 
and 

clawing their way back into the 
game, the Wolverines narrowed 
the deficit to three or fewer 
points 
multiple 
times, 
but 

each time they did, Maryland 
had a response at the ready. 
Eventually, 
Michigan 
simply 

ran out of gas.

“We had some moments there 

where we don’t play with the 
same IQ, the intensity that you 
need,” Beilein said. “It just bites 
you in this game. … What was 
tough was when we made a big 
play and cut it down, they made 
one right back. It’s hard to keep 
doing that.”

In their opening week of 

Big Ten play, the Wolverines 
played three close contests in 
which they sat back and let the 
opponent take the driver’s seat. 
And as a result, they sit just 
four points away from a winless 
start.

After the turbulent week, Irvin 

declared that Michigan can’t 
afford to wait to be “punched in 
the mouth” in order to fire up its 
engine. In a conference season 
as unpredictable as this one is 
shaping up to be, the Wolverines 
would be wise to heed his advice. 
Until they learn how to execute 
from start to finish, the questions 
about their destiny this year 
won’t be going anywhere.

Wolverines look to rebound against Hoosiers

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is looking for 
redemption.

After traveling to No. 11 

Ohio 
State 

and 
dropping 

their last game 
96-87, 
the 

Wolverines (2-1 
Big Ten, 13-4 
overall) 
are 

eager to move 
past their rival 
loss. 
A 
win 

against Indiana 
(2-1, 
12-4) 

Tuesday night 
could 
prevent 

a 
season-

jarring loss of 
momentum for 
Michigan.

The 
Hoosiers 
played 
the 

Buckeyes on Dec. 31, also losing, 
92-82. Their common loss, and 
the closeness of the two team’s 
records, make Indiana and the 
Wolverines almost equals — the 
perfect matchup for an exciting 
game.

But 
Michigan 
may 
take 

the 
edge, 
as 
junior 
guard 

and leading scorer Katelynn 
Flaherty is expected to bring a 
missed intensity to the court. 

While 
Flaherty 
has 
been 

essential 
in 

every 
game 

this 
season, 

she 
recently 

went 
through 

a 
lackluster 

period compared 
to 
her 
usual 

high-scoring 
self; 
against 

Wisconsin 
on 

Jan. 1, Flaherty 
managed 
just 

eight 
points. 

But she found 
her mojo once 
more 
against 

Ohio State, when she stunned 
everyone with a career-high 
38-point performance.

Her eight 3-pointers against 

the Buckeyes set a new school 
record, 
and 
her 
post-game 

attitude showed that she was 
confident in her capabilities — it 
all stemmed from hard work.

“I just try to do what my team 

needs me to do,” Flaherty said 
Saturday after the game. “And 
today it was scoring. So I think 
I was really persistent with that, 
and I knew that I need to score 
to help us be successful.”

Added 
Ohio 
State 
coach 

Kevin Gruff: “That’s one of the 
byproducts of letting (Flaherty) 
get so comfortable early in the 
game, now all the sudden you’re 
dealing with her feeling good 
the whole way out. I thought our 
effort on her got better as the 
game went, but she was feeling 
so good that she was making 
really tough shots. She’s a great 
player.”

While a repeat performance 

might 
be 
tough 
to 
attain, 

Flaherty will have momentum 
and confidence, which will be 
a dangerous combination for 
Indiana to defend against.

Junior 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston and senior guard Siera 
Thompson were also game-
changers for Michigan against 
Ohio State, and while they did 
not sink quite as many baskets as 
Flaherty, the duo was effective 
in other areas of the court.

Dunston 
has 
been 
an 

important defensive presence 
for the Wolverines all season, 

and 
with 
her 

double-double 
last 
game, 

she 
reminded 

onlookers 
that 

she is effective 
on 
both 
ends 

of 
the 
court. 

While 
her 

eight 
defensive 

rebounds and 10 
points 
weren’t 

enough 
to 

shift 
the 
tide 

of the game in 
Michigan’s favor, 
Dunston earned 

double the defensive rebounds 
as the next highest Wolverine.

Thompson 
was 
the 
only 

Michigan player to stay on 
the court for all 40 minutes — 
unsurprising to anyone who 

has heard Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico discuss the impact 
of her co-captain on the rest of 
the team.

Against 
the 
Buckeyes, 

Thompson dished out 10 assists, 
and was just two points shy of her 
own double-double. Thompson 
currently has a team-high 92 
assists on the season, and will 
need to continue playmaking in 
order for the Wolverines to win 
against Indiana.

While Flaherty, Dunston, and 

Thompson will attempt to build 
on their successes of last game, 
sophomore 
forward 
Hallie 

Thome will be trying to rectify 
her impact. 

“Hallie Thome picked up her 

second foul,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I thought that was critical. We 
were out-rebounding them in 
the first quarter, and then we 
lost our 6-foot-5 inside presence 

and then we drastically dropped 
down and went small. We 
didn’t have the 
same 
defensive 

or 
offensive 

presence that we 
did with her in 
the game.”

Despite 

fouling 
out, 

Thome 
picked 

up 
13 
points, 

making her 23 
minutes 
still 

the 
second-

most offensively 
productive 
performance for 
Michigan.

Having Thome on the court is 

necessary for the Wolverines to 
win. Her field goal percentage 
this season is 63.5 percent — 
higher than any team average 
in the NCAA. Thome’s Jan. 1 

performance against Wisconsin 
netted her 37 points, which 

was 
by 
far 

Michigan’s best 
performance 
of 

the night, and 
Thome’s 
own 

career high. 

Even without 

Thome, 
the 

main reason that 
the 
Wolverines 

could not defend 
against 
the 

Buckeyes 
last 

game 
was 
the 

sheer 
depth 

that Ohio State 
possessed, with 

six different players scoring in 
the double-digits. While that 
type of game is an anomaly, it 
proves that an entire team effort 
is needed to be successful in this 
league.

Michigan 
cannot 
rely 
on 

just 
its 
starting 
five. 
The 

players coming off the bench, 
like sophomore guard Nicole 
Munger, have to be ready to 
perform at their peak.

It 
would 
also 
help 
the 

Wolverines 
if 
Flaherty 
and 

Thome played their best game 
at the same time. Lately, it 
seems as though they have been 
alternating strong showings and 
more restful games. Though 
each player is capable of leading 
Michigan on her own, a standout 
performance from both leading 
scorers in the same game could 
certainly seal a win for the 
Wolverines.

If Flaherty and Thome can 

manage 
that, 
the 
Hoosiers 

should be ready for a barrage 
of some of the most accurate 
shooting they have faced thus 
far. 

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Junior guard Katelynn Flaherty is looking to build off a season-high 38-point performance against the Buckeyes when Michigan faces Indiana on Tuesday night.

I just try to do 
what my team 
needs me to do. 

And today it 
was scoring.

Hallie Thome 
picked up her 
second foul. I 
thought that 
was critical.
