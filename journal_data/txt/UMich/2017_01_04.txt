As the minimum age to 

purchase 
tobacco 
products 

and e-cigarettes in Ann Arbor 
changes from 18 to 21 with 
the turn of the new year, the 
community reacts with mixed 
opinions.

The resolution, introduced 

by Ann Arbor Councilmember 
Julie Grand (D–Ward 3), passed 
its initial read July 18, before 
being officially approved Aug. 4 
by a City Council vote of 9-2.

Ann Arbor is the first city 

in Michigan to implement the 
measure as part of the Tobacco 
21 national movement. This 
proactive effort, led by the 
Preventing Tobacco Addiction 

Foundation 
when 
aims 
to 

reduce smoking and tobacco-
related health problems.

The Saint Joseph Mercy 

Health 
System 
in 
Canton, 

Michigan— 
working 
in 

collaboration with community 
members and local officials — 
funded signs for retailers to 
post in their stores with the 
new legal tobacco purchase age 
as well as the city press release 
explaining the measure.

As of right now, there is no 

developed plan to educate local 
tobacco 
retailers. 
However, 

Grand said there may be further 
action if the ordinance poses 
complications.

“If we feel like something 

else needs to be done, we’ll 

Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian 

Calley signed a bill on last week 
banning local governments from 
regulating plastic shopping bags 
in the state. The legislation 
supersedes 
Washtenaw 

County’s fee on plastic bags, the 
first regulation of its kind in the 
state. 

Senate Bill 853 prohibits 

municipalities from banning 
or placing fees on “auxiliary 
containers,” 
which 
include 

plastic single-use bags and other 
disposable packaging. The bill 
will go into effect on March 6.

The 10-cent fee adopted by 

the Washtenaw County Board 
of Commissioners in June was 
scheduled to take effect this 
April.

The 
Republican-sponsored 

bill passed on almost completely 
partisan lines in both houses of 
state legislature, 62-46 in the 
House of Representatives and 
25-12 in the Senate.

State Rep. Adam Zemke (D–

Ann Arbor) criticized the bill 
for attacking local governments’ 
autonomy.

“This is largely a local issue 

and I thought it was a really 
big infringement on what the 
local government had decided 
for itself,” Zemke said. “The 
state already has a really nasty 
precedent set of limiting local 
control. It’s overreach.”

Supporters of the bill argue 

that 
the 
implementation 

of 
“patchwork 
legislation” 

hinders the ability of national 
businesses to adhere to all 
county regulations and adds 
unnecessary complexities and 
costs.

Robert 
O’Meara, 
the 

Michigan 
Restaurant 

Association’s 
vice 
president 

of government affairs, said in 
a statement business will be 
hindered 
with 
“patchwork 

legislation” 
in 
place, 
and 

supported 
the 
bill 
as 
it 

reduced restrictions for chain 
restaurants.

“With many of our members 

owning and operating locations 
across the state, preventing 
a 
patchwork 
approach 
of 

additional 
regulations 
is 

imperative 
to 
avoid 
added 

complexities as it related to day-
to-day 
business 
operations,” 

O’Meara said.

State 
Sen. 
Jim 
Stamas 

(R–Midland) 
also 
called 

for consistency in business 
regulations when he introduced 
the bill in April, according to 
MLive.

“This simply provides that 

you’re not putting different 
regulations across the state on 
the containers,” he said.

Zemke pushed back against 

claims of inconsistency.

“You’re talking about one 

community that charges for a 

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — On a 

night when Jourdan Lewis became 
Michigan’s all-time record holder 
for career pass breakups, further 
cementing his status as one of 
the best cornerbacks in program 
history, the senior All-American 
lined up to make a play he makes 
all the time.

He 
has 
haunted 
opposing 

receivers on those plays for most of 
his career. He gets his hands on the 
ball almost as often as they do, and 
opponents have simply stopped 
throwing at him. Entering Friday’s 
Orange Bowl, receivers had just 10 
catches against him, while Lewis 
had eight pass breakups and two 
interceptions.

With 42 seconds left in the 

game Friday, Lewis lined up in the 
slot against Florida State receiver 
Nyqwan Murray. On 3rd-and-9 
from the Michigan 12-yard line — 
with the Wolverines up by a field 
goal — if Lewis could just break 
up one more pass, he could at least 
force overtime. But the Seminoles 
had one more highlight in them.

“He snatched the ball out of the 

air,” Lewis said after the game. “I 
turned my head around a tad bit

Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor speaks at the City Council meeting on Tuesday.

Ann Arbor residents who are 

hearing-impaired may soon be 
able to enjoy closed captioning in 
television sets in public areas.

During their first meeting of 

the year, City Council discussed 
a new city ordinance mandating 

that any television set compatible 
with closed captioning in “places 
of 
public 
accommodation” 
– 

such as businesses, schools, and 
restaurants – must activate the 
feature to accommodate those 
residents 
with 
hearing 
loss 

problems. Television sets unable 
to provide closed captioning are 
exempt from the requirement.

The council did not vote on 

the 
ordinance 
this 
meeting. 

Councilmember Kirk Westphal 
(D-Ward 2) said because he 
is waiting for responses from 
members 
of 
the 
business 

community in an A2 Open City 
Hall survey, he is postponing the 
vote until the first meeting in 
February.

Westphal, who sponsored the 

ordinance, said similar measures 
in 
Portland, 
Oregon 
were 

implemented last December with 
only one compliant. Westphal 
reasoned the process in Ann Arbor 
should not be complicated to 
implement if similiar to Portland.

Currently, only meetings of the

Ford 
CEO 
Mark 
Fields 

announced plans to invest $700 
million into Michigan while 
cancelling a $1.6 billion plant in 
San Luis Potosi, Mexico in a press 
conference Tuesday morning.

According 
to 
Fields, 
the 

new Michigan investment will 
involve a transformation of a 
facility in Flat Rock into a new 
manufacturing and innovation 
center, which will in turn create 
700 jobs.

“We are today announcing 

that we are investing $700 
million to transform Flat Rock 
into a new manufacturing and 
innovation center,” Fields said.

Ford does still plan to build 

the next generation of its Focus 
in Hermosillo, Mexico in order to 
maintain profitability.

The 
announcement 
also 

included information about a 
new initiative towards electric 
vehicles. Fields said Ford will 
launch 13 new hybrid and electric 
vehicles including the F-150 and 
Mustang, some of the company’s 
best selling vehicles, over the 
next five years as part of a $4.5 
billion investment.

Former State Senator Gretchen 
Whitmer files to run for governor

The previous Democratic minority leader is the first to enter 2018 race

An unnamed University of 

Michigan anthropologist examined 

the five-year-old mummified 

remains of an unidentified body 

Tuesday evening.

The body, found in a garage 

behind a Detroit house, was in 

the backseat of a ’90s Plymouth 

Acclaim, the Detroit Free Press 

reported. The skeleton was decayed 

to the point it became necessary for 

a specialist was asked to perform 

the autopsy. Authorities said 

the remains consisted of brown, 

leathery bones fully clothed in 

pants, a shirt and a sweater.

“They don’t know the sex or 

approximate age, so that’s why they 

need an anthropologist,” said Lloyd 

Jackson, Wayne County Medical 

Examiner’s Office spokesman, in a 

statement Monday.

A prospective buyer of the 

residential property found the body 

when he looked in the detached 

garage behind the house. The 

current tenants of the house told 

police of the property owner’s ban 

on using the garage and insisted 

they never went into it.

A spokesman for 

the Detroit Police 

Department told the 

Detroit Free Press the 

remains had likely been 

there for “quite some 

time” and the body has 

been inspected, though 

no specific information 

can yet be determined 

about the cause of death 

or identity of the person.

The discovery 

emerges after two recent 

similar cases in Michigan. 

According to the Free 

Press, a 78-year old 

Hazel Park resident was 

found mummified in his home in 

2016, and a repairman in Pontiac 

discovered a mummy of a 44-year-

old woman when he was hired to 

repair her foreclosed home in 2014.

Neither the University nor the 

Wayne County Medical Examiner’s 

Office were available to comment 

on the autopsy findings at the time 

of publication.

ON THE DAILY: ‘U’ PROF AUTOPSIES FIVE-YEAR-OLD MUMMY

CAKE BY THE OCE AN

Gretchen Whitmer, former 

Democratic 
minority 
leader 

in the Michigan state senate 
and lecturer at the Ford School 
of Public Policy, announced 
Tuesday that she has officially 
filed the paperwork to run for 
governor of Michigan in 2018. 

Although 
a 
formal 

announcement has not yet been 
made — it is expected later this 
month — Whitmer published 
a statement on Medium and 
sent an email to her supporters 
regarding her intent to run.

“I remember when Michigan 

was bold,” Whitmer wrote in her 
email. “When we didn’t just face 
challenges — we beat them.”

Whitmer also discussed her 

desire to foster business growth, 
fight for children and families, 
and create “opportunities … to 
enjoy our land and drink pure, 
clean water.”

In the email, she also stressed 

the 
importance 
of 
actively 

working toward solutions to 
the issues the state faces. Her 
rhetoric follows themes seen in 
the 2016 presidential election 
where President-elect Donald 
Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders 
(I–Vt.) focused on messages 

of change within the political 
system.

“For too long, our leaders 

have been content to manage our 
decline. We went from leading 
the nation to lagging,” Whitmer 
wrote. “We can do better. We 
deserve better.” 

Filing the paperwork is the 

first step in Whitmer’s process 
to run, and with it she is now 
able to begin accepting financial 
contributions to her campaign.

Whitmer, 
who 
served 

in the Michigan House of 
Representatives 
from 
2000 

to 2006 and the Michigan 
Senate from 2006 to 2015, most 
recently served as the Ingham 
County prosecutor. Her term 
expired on Dec. 31, 2016. She 
is the first person to put their 
name in the 2018 gubernatorial 
race.

LSA junior Collin Kelly, the 

chair of College Democrats 

chapter at the University of 

Michigan, said while it is still 
the beginning stages of the 
race, he is optimistic about her 
strengths.

“It’s still super early; we 

don’t know who else is going to 
run,” Kelly said. “But we know 
she’s a strong candidate who 
can rally the party … We’re 
proud of all the work she’s 
done (in her past positions).”

“I remember

challenges — we 

beat them” 

“For too long our

late, and they made a great throw 
and catch. It was great execution. 
I just wish I turned my head 
around.”

Murray caught the game-

winning 
12-yard 
touchdown 

pass from Deondre Francois to 
end Michigan’s season with yet 

another classic, as Florida State 
pulled out a 33-32 victory. In a 
year with so much promise, the 
Wolverines will finish with the 
same 10-3 record they had in 
2015.

In the end, that was the 

story of the Orange Bowl — the 
Seminoles made more plays than 
Michigan did, in part because 
the Wolverines’ best playmaker 
never took the field.

In 
Thursday’s 
practice, 

do-everything 
redshirt 

sophomore 
Jabrill 
Peppers 

jumped for a ball and felt his 
hamstring pull. A hour before 
kickoff Friday, Peppers came out 
of the tunnel and began warming 
up, trying to reach a point where 
he could play.

“They wrapped it, icy hot, 

pain relievers, you name it,” he 
said.

He couldn’t run or cut without 

feeling a sharp sensation. The 
Heisman Trophy finalist missed 

his second straight bowl game 
with an injury.

“Just knowing you could help 

someway, somehow, and just 
watching, that sucks even more,” 
an emotional Peppers said after 
the game. “You could help the 
seniors go out the way they 
deserve to go out.”

Meanwhile, 
Florida 
State 

unleashed its full arsenal of 
weapons. With the Wolverines 
within five points early in the 
fourth quarter, All-American 
running 
back 
Dalvin 
Cook 

scampered 71 yards to set up what 
appeared to be a game-clinching 
touchdown. 
After 
Michigan 

made a dramatic comeback to 
take the lead with 1:57 to go, the 
Seminoles’ Keith Gavin returned 
the ensuing kickoff 66 yards, and 
Cook hurried into the red zone 
again, setting up the true game-
winning touchdown.

Then, 
of 
course, 
came 

Murray’s grab. Michigan blocked 
the extra point, and freshman 
safety Josh Metellus returned it 
for two points, cutting the deficit 
to 33-32 with just 36 seconds left. 
But Michigan’s magic ran out, as 
redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight was intercepted 
on 4th-and-10 with 16 seconds 
to go.

After the Wolverines spent 

most 
of 
the 
game 
digging 

themselves into a hole, Speight 
and the offense dug out of it in a 
matter of minutes. They caught 
a break with 7:58 to go when 
a short punt and a targeting 
penalty gave them the ball at 
Florida State’s 37-yard line.

Michigan scored twice in the 

next six minutes, once on an 
eight-yard pass from Speight to 
redshirt junior fullback Khalid 
Hill, and then on a 30-yard 
rush by freshman running back 
Chris Evans. Those two drives 
represented almost half of the 
Wolverines’ total yards, and 
Evans’ run comprised a third of 
their rushing total. Suddenly, 
Michigan had the lead.

But Florida State’s touchdown 

was the final blow, dealing 

the 
Wolverines 
another 

heartbreaking 
defeat. 
Their 

three losses this season came by 
a total of five points, and they led 
in the final minute of all of them.

“Sometimes the other team 

executes a little bit more than 
other teams,” Lewis said. “That’s 
what it really was. We didn’t 
perform as well as we should 
have, but I’m glad the way that 
everybody 
fought, 
and 
I’m 

extremely proud of it.”

In Peppers, Michigan missed 

its strong-side linebacker, return 
man and wildcat quarterback, 
and his absence showed in 
all three phases. Then, in the 
second quarter, the Wolverines 
suffered perhaps their most 
crushing blow of the game when 
senior tight end Jake Butt went 
down holding his right knee 
and wincing. He walked off to 
the locker room under his own 
power with a towel covering his 
face and did not return. Michigan 
missed him, too, particularly on 
third downs and in the red zone.

Florida State, on the other 

hand, 
received 
dazzling 

performances 
from 
its 
key 

contributors. 
Francois 
threw 

for 222 yards and a 92-yard 
touchdown. 
Defensive 
end 

DeMarcus Walker made four 
tackles for loss and a sack. And 
Cook finished with 20 carries 
for 145 yards, setting up three of 
the Seminoles’ four touchdown 
drives with long runs.

“If we would have stopped 

maybe those three, four, five 
big plays,” said Michigan fifth-
year senior defensive end Chris 
Wormley, “it would have been a 
little different.”

bag,” he said. “I don’t see how 
the 
restaurant 
association 

could argue that restaurants in 
Washtenaw would go through 
a much larger hurdle in doing 
business. It’s way overstated.”

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D–

Ann Arbor) said the Michigan 
Restaurant 
Association’s 

argument was not relevant to 
the bill, especially considering 
Washtenaw County’s proposed 
fee applied only to grocery 
stores.

“I think that if (the Michigan 

Restaurant 
Association) 

actually 
meant 
that 
they 

wanted more consistency they 

would be pushing for a way 
to address this statewide,” 
he said. “They just pushed 
for local units to do it locally. 
They’re 
making 
convenient 

arguments.”

Across the nation, states 

such as Hawaii and California 
implemented statewide bans 
on plastic bags in response 
to 
environmental 
concerns. 

Large cities including Austin, 
Seattle and Chicago also have 
similar restrictions in place. 
Zemke cited these examples 
to emphasize the local fee 
was put in place to decrease 
the prevalence of plastic in 
landfills.

“Michigan’s approach will 

have a negative environmental 
impact,” he said.

With the new bill, Michigan 

joins states such as Idaho, 
Arizona and Florida in banning 
plastic bag restrictions in an 
effort to defend businesses.

certainly watch it carefully,” she 
said. “If there are a whole bunch 
of questions or if we just feel 
like retailers are not getting the 
message, we’ll look to see if we 
need to do anything else.”

Grand said one cited advantage 

of the policy is that under the new 
regulation the tobacco purchase 
age is now the same as the alcohol 
purchase age. She said she hopes 
this 
regulation 
will 
simplify 

business for retailers.

In support of the ordinance, 

Grand also pointed to high-
school-age students, explaining 
that it is common for people 15 to 
17 years old to experiment with 
tobacco, and that most people 
in this age range acquire their 
tobacco products from 18- to 
20-year-olds. In this regard, she 
said the ordinance’s benefits are 
twofold.

“You help curtail initiation by 

cutting off that very important 
social source of tobacco products, 
which typically is an 18-year-old 
that still goes to school or is in 
some sort of social network of a 
15- to 17-year-old,” she said.

Additionally, 
the 
measure 

could stop 18- to 20-year-olds 
who 
are 
transitioning 
from 

experimental to regular tobacco 
users by making it more difficult 
for them to purchase products 
and become addicted.

Specifically in a college town, 

with many residents in the 18-to-
20 age range, Grand said the 

ordinance may be particularly 
helpful. Though she recognized 
that 
someone 
who 
is 
truly 

addicted can acquire tobacco 
through other means, she said she 
hopes the ordinance will be able 
to positively influence students.

Though University of Michigan 

buildings have been designated 
smoke-free since 2011, there is 
still uncertainty as to whether 
the policy is effective. Resources 
such as the Tobacco Consultation 
Service and Wolverine Wellness 
offer treatment and counseling 
opportunities for students.

Additionally, Grand said the 

ordinance specifically does not 
punish 18- to 20-year-olds who 
use tobacco, it just prevents them 
from purchasing it.

“We removed any penalties for 

youth possession, because it is 
never the intent to penalize use for 
either normal experimentation or 
addiction to tobacco products,” 
she said. “The penalties are on the 
retailer and even then we allow 
a lot of discretion with the new 
ordinance so that we can leave 
time for education.”

Retailers’ Opposition
From a different perspective, 

local retailers are not happy with 
the ordinance, as it will directly 
hurt business.

Chris Rosenthal, owner of 

Tobacco 
Rose 
Cigars, 
spoke 

against the ordinance at the 
Aug. 4 meeting, and to the Daily 
shortly thereafter.

In a recent interview with 

Rosenthal, he said the ordinance 
will undoubtedly hurt business 
because it knocks out three years 
of potential legal purchasing of 

tobacco. However, he said, the 
biggest problem was how the act 
was conceived.

When 
the 
resolution 
was 

presented 
to 
the 
council, 

Rosenthal said Grand emphasized 

the importance of eliminating 
the early run-ins with the law 
by people who are 18 to 20 years 
old, but did so only by preventing 
retailers from selling it to them

“It’s not illegal for them to 

attempt to purchase it, and it’s not 
illegal for them to use it,” he said. 
“All she really did in her attempt 
to keep the younger generation 
out of early legal trouble is force 
business straight out of town.”

Rosenthal added that there 

are nearby towns like Ypsilanti 
where people can easily go to get 
tobacco.

People can make big lifetime 

decisions at 18, such as whether to 
join the military, get married, sign 
contracts and take out student 
loans, Rosenthal argued and it 

should be the same with choosing 
whether to purchase and use 
tobacco products.

City Council Opposition
The resolution’s two opponents, 

Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4) and Jane 
Lumm (I–Ward 2), voted against 
the ordinance because it violates 
state law. The Michigan Tobacco 
Products Tax Act states city 
municipalities shall not create 
new ordinances regarding the 
sale of tobacco products. 

In an interview with the Daily, 

Eaton said, though he agrees with 
the spirit of the measure, he could 
not vote for it as it goes against 
his duty as a council member to 
uphold state law.

“I think it is pretty clear that 

state law preempts our efforts 
to regulate tobacco sales,” he 
said. “Although I would like to 
regulate tobacco in this fashion, 
I think it needs to be done by 
the state, or the state needs to 
let us make these decisions. We 
can’t simply decide to do this in 
contravention of state law.”

According to Eaton, a vendor 

could challenge the ordinance in 
anticipation of being written up 
under the law, or if enforcement 
action should be taken by the 
city, a vendor could fight against 
it.

Eaton 
added 
though 
he 

believes it is necessary to regulate 
tobacco for health reasons and 
educate people on its side effects, 
he does not feel this is the best 
way to address the problem.

“I completely understand the 

desire to dissuade young people 
from smoking,” he said. “I don’t 
think it’s a criminal problem, I 

think it’s a health problem. I’m 
not sure how you address it in a 
meaningful way. I do believe that 
the sponsors of this ordinance 
had the best of intentions, and I 
don’t take them to task for what 
they want to do.”

In 
response 
to 
potential 

conflict, Grand said no one 
is sure what to expect, as 
the state government can be 
unpredictable. 
However, 
she 

said she hopes the state will 
recognize the advantages of the 
ordinance.

“I would hope that they would 

recognize that this is really in 
the interest of public health and 
where tobacco prevention and 
control policy is going nationally, 
and let us try to have some local 

control and work it out and see if 
it actually makes a difference,” 
she said.

Grand 
pointed 
to 
the 

regulatory 
environment 
in 

California, which is very similar 

to that in Michigan. Several 
municipalities 
there 
passed 

Tobacco 21 ordinances, before it 
became state law.

Expert Response 
University facilities are excited 

about the ordinance, in hope 
that it will reduce tobacco use by 
college students and future health 
problems.

Cliff Douglas, adjunct lecturer 

of public health and the American 
Cancer Society’s vice president 
for Tobacco Control, compared 
the situation to raising the tax 
on cigarettes in one state. He 
said though someone can easily 
go to another state to purchase, 
measures like these are still 
effective.

“We find that, in fact, it reduces 

consumption,” 
he 
said. 
“It 

reduces prevalence — the number 
of people who smoke. It’s not 
perfect, but it’s an effective public 
health policy.

Regarding 
the 
legal 

repercussions of the ordinance, 
Douglas, also an attorney, said 
it is very possible the ordinance 
does not defy state law. He said 
the language used in the state 
law is not clear and it does not 
limit a local municipality from 
adjusting the minimum age of 
tobacco purchases.

“The reality is that legal 

experts 
have 
determined 

that there probably is not a 
preemptive effect from this law,” 
he said. “Opponents are welcome 
if they choose to challenge it in 
court, but first of all, it will be 
defended vigorously if they do 
that. Mayor (Christopher) Taylor 
and others have made that clear.”

Fields also announced a new 

electric SUV with a 300 mile 
range and two new electric 
police vehicles within the next 
five years.

“The era of the electric vehicle 

is dawning and we at Ford plan to 
be a leader,” Fields said.

Keeping 
manufacturing 
in 

the United States was a key 
component 
of 
President-elect 

Donald Trump’s campaign. In 
November, Trump announced a 
deal he forged so a Carrier plant 
would remain in the country.

During the press conference, 

Fields stated the support from 
Trump and Congress is in part 
what has allowed this major 
announcement. 

“We are also encouraged by 

the pro-growth policies that 
President-elect Trump and the 

new Congress have indicated 
that they will pursue,” he said. 
“We believe that these tax 
and 
regulatory 
reforms 
are 

critically important to boost U.S. 

competitiveness.”

Following the announcement, 

Trump 
retweeted 
an 
article 

giving himself credit for Ford’s 
move to remain in the U.S. for 
Flat Rock’s innovations.

United Auto Workers vice 

president 
Jimmy 
Settles 

spoke after Fields, saying he 
was incredibly pleased at the 

announcement and the progress 
made since 2009 when the Flat 
Rock facility was slated to be 
closed.

“I’m 
a 
very, 
very 
happy 

and proud person,” he said. “I 
remember back in 2009 when 
this location was on the closing 
list.”

Fields said he looks forward 

to working towards similar goals 
with the UAW.

“I have to tell you, we are so 

proud to work together with the 
UAW to support good paying jobs 
and a profitable business,” he 
said.

Fields concluded the press 

conference by expressing his 
company’s commitment to both 
the United States and work 
towards 
innovative 
vehicle 

technology.

“Ford is a global automaker, 

but our home is here in the United 
States,” Fields said. “We could 
not be more excited about leading 
an electrification going forward.”

Commission on Disability Issues 
are close captioned, according 
to Westphal.

Mayor Christopher Taylor (D) 

further clarified the ordinance 
does not require businesses to 
fund closed captioning, but rather 
that it utilizes city funds for 
closed captioning of city events.

“We have of course here the 

very important and critical 
commitment internally to find 
closed captioning city events,” 
Taylor said. “(But) we are not 
by this ordinance requiring 

that businesses fund closed 
captioning.”

Although all councilmembers 

approved 
of 
the 
substance 

of 
the 
ordinance 
itself, 

some 
had 
questions 
about 

its 
actual 
implementation. 

Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton 

(D-Ward 5) pointed out that not 
every city meeting can be close 
captioned because funds are 
limited.

“What we’re really gonna 

run into is a budget constraint,” 
Eaton 
said. 
“We 
probably 

won’t have any difficulty close 
captioning council meetings... 
But thereafter we really have 
to 
identify 
which 
meetings 

are most important to close 

caption.”

Engineering graduate student 

Michael Benson, who spoke at 
the public hearing about the 
ordinance, 
expressed 
hope 

that this new initiative would 
set a standard of disability 
accommodation for not only the 
city but also the University of 
Michigan.

“Hopefully once this goes 

through at the city level, the 
regents at the University will 
adopt 
a 
similar 
policy 
for 

events,” Benson said in an 
interview. “What the city does 
here 
doesn’t 
command 
the 

University to do anything, but 
hopefully it’ll set an example for 
them to do the same.”

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight threw and interception with 16 seconds left on the clock. 


A

ll 
over 
our 
social 

media feeds, everyone 
is dubbing 2016 the 

worst year. But was it really? 
Frankly, I think the 
reasoning for why 
it was the worst 
is hyperbolic. The 
statement is mainly 
tongue-in-cheek, 
citing the deaths of 
famous 
celebrities 

such 
as 
Prince, 

David Bowie and 
Carrie Fisher as the 
reason why the year 
was 
so 
horrible. 

The reactions to the 
deaths of some of our favorite 
stars are relatively harmless, 
but reveal something about 
the 
country’s 
favoritism 

toward 
the 
famous 
and 

those 
immediately 
in 
our 

consciousness.

At the end of December, 

Fisher, of “Star Wars” Princess 
Leia fame, passed away at the 
age of 60 from a heart attack. 
The outpouring of support and 
well-wishes has been extended 
to her family, co-stars and even 
her dog. There’s nothing wrong 
with this. It may seem trivial 
to some, but I couldn’t imagine 
how I would feel if one of my 
favorite 
entertainers 
passed 

away. What may seem strange 
or unimportant to some means 
something dear to another. Some 
of these people had a personal 
relationship with Fisher, and 
it 
is 
appropriate 
to 
grieve 

immediately after her death.

The problem lies within the 

discrepancy many have when 
grieving over loss of life. This 
isn’t a critique of political 
correctness, 
but 
rather 
an 

observation. 2016 was a year 
of multiple tragedies across 
the globe, which made it 
incredibly 
saddening 
from 

many standpoints. The year 
can’t be deemed as bad solely 
because 
beloved 
celebrities 

passed away. There may be a 
lack of personal connection, 
but there should be equal acts 
of empathy for those who have 

lost their lives in 
Aleppo, for example, 
as well as individuals 
like Fisher.

As of right now, if 

an alien came to our 
planet, they would 
probably 
observe 

that 
the 
masses 

deem 
celebrities 

as more important 
than others. There 
are 
far 
more 

stories 
online 

and 
topics 
of 
discussion 

surrounding celebrity deaths 
and calamities than those of 
regular people. It’s just odd 
that tons of attention goes 
toward one person for a while 
when there are many other 
groups of people that need 
support as well.

I own up that I haven’t 

shown 
equal 
amounts 
of 

concern and grief in these 
situations, either. I text my 
girlfriend 
something 
sad 

about Fisher because we both 
love “Star Wars,” but show no 
sign of sadness or support for 
those oppressed and in danger 
overseas. Doing that made me 
question why others and I do 
this and what these actions 
say about our Western society.

Examples 
like 
these 
of 

favoritism and apathy toward 
others could be from a result 
of lack of coverage, personal 
connection or care toward 
the affected. It’s important 
that we continue to realize 
that all lives matter (not in 
the way that opposes Black 
Lives Matter, but in a fashion 
that 
doesn’t 
dismiss 
the 

oppression of any group of 
people). I had friends point 
out this discrepancy in news 
coverage to me, citing how 
there was constant coverage 

and changing of Facebook 
profile pictures when the 
terrorist 
attack 
happened 

at the Batalan Concert Hall 
in France, but not as many 
cameras or grieving statuses 
in response to violence in 
the Middle East. The United 
States as a government — 
and even its citizens — can 
be prone to show more care 
toward its allies and its own 
than those it isn’t closely 
connected to.

We must not forget about 

the 
disadvantaged 
and 

endangered both on U.S. soil 
and abroad. We can show 
our support and share our 
grief for those people on 
social media, by volunteering, 
donating or reminding others 
of what is going on outside 
of 
our 
immediate 
worlds. 

Again, there’s nothing wrong 
with being sad over the death 
of our favorite celebrities, 
and while they may have 
touched our lives more than 
an average citizen thousands 
of miles away, every life is 
equally important and should 
be treated as such. It’s just 
that many lives aren’t given 
the same amount of limelight 
or recognition.

We can still show our love 

for the beautiful lyricism of 
Bowie that we’ll never hear 
live again, the spunk of Fisher, 
and post memes of how Betty 
White 
and 
other 
elderly 

celebrities should be protected 
from death for the whole 
year. But at the same rate, the 
people of Flint who still don’t 
have clean water, the citizens 
of Aleppo who have seen their 
homes crumble, and tragedies 
that affect our friends and 
family should be recognized 
with at least the same amount 
of effort.

A new kind of resolution

ANU ROY-CHAUDHURY | COLUMN

E

ight percent. That’s the 
percentage of people 
who actually achieve 

their New Year’s 
resolutions. Every 
year, 
millions 

vow to change or 
improve something 
in their lives for 
the coming year. 
It’s a tradition that 
endures even with 
its low success rate 
and 
surrounding 

skepticism. 
But, 

it makes sense. A 
new year is a new 
start, a clean slate and a hopeful 
beginning. It’s a new year that 
has the potential to be better 
than the year before, so we 
make resolutions to ensure the 
potential. If you are one of the 
few who can stick with it, 
even better.

This year feels different. 

In hindsight, 2016 seems like 
a terrible year. The past few 
months have seen shocking 
change after change around 
the world: the enduring crises 
in the Middle East, fatal 
shootings and violence in the 
United States and changing 
political landscapes around 
the world. Simply, change has 
been frequent and unnerving 
in 2016. Social media has 
been 
filled 
with 
statuses, 

tweets and, of course, memes 
commenting 
on 
just 
how 

bad 2016 was and a seeming 
readiness to enter 2017. Yet, 
this 
type 
of 
commentary, 

which 
many 
have 
likely 

seen on Twitter feeds and in 
Instagram posts, is blaming 
2016’s problems on 2016. But 
aren’t we actually to blame?

More often than not, New 

Year’s resolutions are based 
more on our personal lives and 
less on what’s going on in the 
world. This is most evident 
in the popular resolution to 
exercise more, a resolution 
that results in a massive gym 
rush in the weeks following 
New 
Year’s. 
Resolutions 

always seem to be individual 

and insular. They are about 
improving our own lives and 
are derived from sayings like 

“New year, new me.”

With this type of 

thinking, New Year’s 
resolutions take on a 
sense of selfishness, 
a selfishness we are 
all prone to. And 
maybe, just maybe, 
that’s why they fail. 
As 
the 
8 
percent 

shows, these types of 
personal resolutions 
aren’t 
typically 

followed 
through 

on, which means the packed 
gym 
eventually 
dwindles 

down to its normal crowd. So, 
if resolutions are supposed 
to be about improving the 
coming 
year, 
maybe 
we 

shouldn’t focus simply on 
ourselves. Perhaps a new kind 
of resolution is needed.

A few years back, my high 

school English teacher showed 
our class Chimamanda Ngozi 
Adichie’s 
TED 
Talk 
“The 

Danger of a Single Story.” This 
TED Talk eventually became 
one of the most watched of its 
kind. Over break, I decided to 
re-watch it and was reminded 
of just how powerful words are. 
And just as most TED Talks 
do, the speech made me really 
think. Originally given in 2009, 
its 
message 
of 
assumption 

and acceptance is one that, 
in light of recent events, felt 
more fitting than ever. Adichie, 
who was born in Nigeria, talks 
about 
her 
experience 
with 

stereotypes 
throughout 
her 

life and how the single story 
or stereotype is a mark and 
perpetuation of a power which 
disregards so much.

Adichie 
explains 
how 

important 
and 
prominent 

storytelling is in our lives, 
whether we realize it or not. 
We learn from talking to each 
other, 
from 
hearing 
about 

different experiences, which 
ultimately add to our own. 
A 
“single 
story,” 
however, 

is 
detrimental. 
Instead 
of 

creating human connections, a 
single story dissolves them.

With the recent election 

and crises around the world, 
division seems more apparent 
than 
ever. 
On 
our 
own 

campus, our own microcosm 
of the world, we have felt 
the 
divisiveness. 
Posters, 

petitions and protests, along 
with a rise in hate crimes 
post-election, 
have 
formed 

from stereotyping those who 
don’t agree with us. It then 
creates a division that at its 
root comes from assumption, 
stereotyping and ultimately 
the “single story.”

After watching the TED 

Talk last week, I got rid of 
my original and admittedly 
selfish resolution and instead 
decided on a new one: Work 
to prevent the single story and 
stray from accepting it. After 
all, stereotypes are almost 
like a heuristic — it’s a short 
cut and a defense mechanism 
for many. Yet, its dangers 
were exemplified by many 
events in 2016 and as Adichie 
so eloquently said, “When we 
reject the single story, when 
we realize that there is never 
a single story about any place, 
we regain a kind of paradise.”

Talk about how horrible 

2016 was is warranted. But 
blaming it on something as 
intangible as four numbers 
is not. It was a rough year, 
it was a divisive year, but 
if we make resolutions on 
improving 
ourselves 
for 

the next year, then why not 
gear them toward improving 
things around us? New Year’s 
resolutions seem to be about 
the individual, and they often 
fail. So maybe, just maybe, 
a resolution that is for more 
than just ourselves can have 
a better success rate. I know 
my resolution is ambitious, 
but maybe it will be easier and 
more worthwhile than going 
to the gym every day.

2016’s forgotten tragedies 

CHRIS CROWDER | COLUMN

CHRIS

CROWDER

ANU 

ROY-CHAUDHURY

T

his past year was a 
bizarre ride. The Cubs 
won the World Series, 

“killer” 
clowns 
allegedly 

roamed the land and the man 
who invented the Kinder Egg 
Surprise passed away, just to 
name a few. I could go on.

For 
me, 
however, 
the 

strangest part of 2016 might 
have been getting by on my 
Franglish for 10 weeks to work 
in Tours, France, at an event 
management company. And, 
more specifically, the most 
surreal part had to be working 
at the Tours American Festival.

Imagine Elvis impersonators 

and trucks, country music and 
Twinkies — everything that 
apparently 
spells 
American 

culture to a foreign nation. 
I wasn’t sure what to expect 
when I showed up at work 
on the first day, but it wasn’t 
really that. When I think of the 
United States, I think of a lot of 
things, but not necessarily swing 
dancing and rodeos.

It 
was 
strange 
to 
walk 

through the booths and find 
small, eccentric elements of a 
larger picture of my home, like 
stumbling on a baffling puzzle 
that was partially put together 
with none of the missing pieces 
present. When these pieces came 
together, they didn’t make a map 
of the states, but rather an odd 
caricature of the old West with 
some of the aesthetics of the 1950s 
(which, now that I’ve written that 
sentence, I feel needs to be the 
basis of a horror film).

The main upsides for me 

were that A) I got to enjoy some 
cupcakes 
there, 
which 
was 

great because they’re not the 
most common dessert to find in 
France, and B) my conspicuous 
American accent became an 
attractive oddity to the people I 
spoke with rather than a reason 
to walk away quickly.

However, there was a strange 

discomfort in existing in that 

space and seeing my own culture 
through 
another 
country’s 

lens. There was no context for 
anything that was on display, 
including the cringier parts of 
our history and cultural artifacts 
that had been included. There 
were women walking around 
in attire that recalled 1950s 
housewives, 
complete 
with 

aprons (hmm...), teepees next 
to 
parked 
covered 
wagons 

(yikes) and T-shirts with the 
Confederate 
flag 
on 
them 

(yikes again).

Not for the first time, I 

considered 
the 
incredibly 

complex concept of cultural 
appropriation, or, to grossly 
oversimplify 
it, 
the 
use 
or 

adoption of one culture’s elements 
(fashion, slang, customs, etc.) by 
another culture. Was this that? 
Was American culture being 
appropriated? I couldn’t help 
but think that were this a Syrian 
Festival or a Chinese Fair put on 
by French natives in the way that 
this American festival was being 
produced, picking and choosing 
bits and pieces of their aesthetic 
and music and history to partake 
in, there might have been issues 
(to put it lightly). In this case 
though, I couldn’t see any kind 
of backlash coming from it, and 
perhaps rightly so.

To be completely honest, 

I was slightly uncomfortable 
with the incongruous portrayal 
of America that I was seeing. It 
left out some of the best and the 
worst aspects of the country, 
from our weird school systems 
to our ability to make a club or 

organization for almost anything 
to our worrisome race relations.

However, 
I 
didn’t 
feel 

particularly upset with what 
I was experiencing. The fact 
of the matter, since it was the 
United 
States 
in 
question, 

is that American culture is 
already one of, if not the most, 
dominant 
cultures 
in 
the 

world. Our media is spread 
worldwide, 
and 
American 

tastes are often catered to or 
treated as the default. While 
there are plentiful issues with 
imposing 
American 
culture 

and ideals on a global scale, 
it’s 
already 
happened. 
It’s 

out there and if others want 
to respectfully play in the 
sandbox that is our culture, I 
would say, “Here’s a shovel — 
I’m making a sandcastle.”

In short, while I would have 

liked to have been sure that the 
people around me understood 
the context and history of what 
they were engaging with, I really 
didn’t mind others participating 
in 
it. 
American 
culture 
in 

particular isn’t one that can 
solely be behind glass; at this 
point in globalization, it’s in its 
nature to be shared as others 
see fit. We can’t own what we’ve 
given away.

That said, I do have some 

suggestions 
for 
the 
next 

American 
Festival. 
There 

needs to be a rule that everyone 
smile uncomfortably or give 
a nod of acknowledgement to 
everyone they pass — bonus 
points if you show teeth when 
you smile. When the vendors 
sell something, they have to ask 
how the customer is doing, even 
if they don’t care or don’t know 
them. Every kiosk needs a drive-
thru lane. All drinks need to 
have free refills and ice cubes. 
(Even coffee. It is law.)

Including these small changes 

might add up to something closer 
to what America really looks like. 
That’s my America, at least.

There 
are 
few 
things 

that 
manifest 
holiday 

spirit as much as baking, 
especially 
homebaking. 

From 
gingerbread 
cookies 

to Christmas puddings and 
everything in between, there’s 
no lack of sweet treats to 
satisfy our holiday cravings. 
What could be as good as 
indulging in the miscellany 
of baked goods that emerge 
during this festive season? 
Watching an assorted crop 
of talented amateur bakers 
demonstrate 
their 
holiday 

spirit in “The Great British 
Bake-Off” tent.

For those unfamiliar with 

“GBBO,” 
the 

UK competition 
show 
pits 

various 
homebakers 
against 
one 

another 
to 

determine 
the 
best 

among 
them. 

Hosted by the 
charming 
Mel 

Giedroyc 
and 

Sue 
Perkins, 

both 
English 

comedians, and judged by 
cookbook author Mary Berry 
(come on, it doesn’t get more 
festive than a name like that) 
and professional baker Paul 
Hollywood, the series serves 
up great fun.

Paul 
and 
Mary 
don 

Christmas 
sweaters 
in 

preparation 
to 
judge 

competitors 
from 
previous 

seasons 
who 
return 
for 

another shot at culinary glory 
in the series finale which aired 
in two parts, “Christmas Day” 
and “Boxing Day.” In a series of 
three challenges — signature, 
technical and showstopper — 
the bakers must impress the 
judges with their creativity 
and skill.

While aided by the judges’ 

instructions in the technical 
challenges 
and 
their 
own 

recipes in the others, there’s 
no shortage of setbacks for 
the aspiring bakers who fight 
against the clock and their 
own 
inexperience 
in 
the 

kitchen. But both the judges 
and hosts reassure the uneasy 
contestants as they make their 

rounds early in each challenge 
and prod each contestant to 
explain their plans of action. 
Mel and Sue even spur them 
on with good-natured words 
of encouragement — though 
at times contestants find them 
distracting (for instance when 
Part One competitor Mary-
Anne attempted to repel Sue’s 
insistent hug). 

The special hits a sweet 

spot 
between 
sentimental 

and 
spectacle, 
showcasing 

the 
fusion 
of 
personality 

and 
passion 
in 
culinary 

achievement. 
While 
the 

homebakers stumble at times 
under the strain of competition, 
they push forward with their 
past experience and cheerful 
sportsmanship to carry them 
through.

What the show lacks in 

suspense 
and 

excitement 
it 

makes up for in 
sheer 
geniality 

and insight into 
the 
minds 
of 

homebakers 
— 

with a delightful 
representation 
of 
various 
UK 

sweets 
and 

pastries to keep 
us glued to the 
action on screen.

With 
the 

variety of contestants, there is 
a great diversity in the talent 
showcased. Some contestants 
call back to their roots using 
flavors to embolden otherwise 
traditional recipes. Veering 
towards 
the 

more 
“exotic” 

is 
typically 

rewarded 
by 

the 
judges 

who like to see 
personality 
shine through 
in the fare they 
sample.

The judges — 

who are more 
than 
willing 

to dole out praise to the eager 
competitors, especially given 
their histories on the show 
— don’t hesitate to criticize 
where some more constructive 
feedback is due. 

And the judges certainly 

know what they’re talking 
about — clarifying some of 
the more daunting methods 
involved 
in 
the 
technical 

challenges to audiences at 
home prior to the challenges 

commencing. 
To 
those 

unfamiliar 
with 
baking 

technique, explanation of the 
precise 
methods 
required 

of the contestants can be 
illuminating, or it can be a 
slightly 
dulling 
exposition 

taking up airtime. Regardless, 
we’re made to feel a little more 
like experts watching from 
home.

The competition is handled 

with 
as 
much 
care 
and 

delicacy as the the challenges 
themselves. As the bakers 
strive to knead the perfect 
dough and achieve the right 
balance 
of 
flavors, 
they 

interact freely with the judges 
and hosts who encourage them 
with animated commentary. 

Each contestant’s competing 

items are introduced with 
mouth-watering illustrations 
accompanied by the hosts’ 
descriptions of them. Though 
the contestants are expected 
to execute each challenge with 
precision and deftness given 
time they have to prepare 
beforehand, some are overly 
ambitious. One contestant’s 
gingerbread 
tiers 
collapse 

on 
themselves 
during 
the 

showstopper in Part Two, 
while 
another 
mistakes 

flour for powdered sugar, 
making for unconventionally 
disgusting icing. 

Though 
we 
follow 
the 

contestants through success 
and disappointment, the nature 
of watching amateurs trying 
to impress a panel of kind, 
yet imposing judges carries 

strength 
in 

its 
hint 
of 

emotional 
suspense 
— 
one 
that 

is 
rather 

different from 
the excitement 
we’re 
used 
to 
on 

professional 
cooking 
competitions.

Only one contestant can 

take home the winning title, 
however 
everyone 
leaves 

the 
tent 
in 
good 
spirits, 

exuding contagious positivity. 
While the pros make it look 
easy, 
watching 
“GBBO” 

veterans attempt three tier 
masterpieces and inventive 
cookie 
decorations 
simply 

for the fun of it is the most 
rewarding of all.

If someone were to see a trailer 

for the movie “Collateral Beauty,” 
they would probably assume that 
it’s a realistic fantasy film about a 
man coping with his daughter’s 
death by having conversations 
with Death, Time and Love. This 
is not true. To disclose the real 
plot would almost be a spoiler in 
and of itself, so it has to be left 
at this: “Collateral Beauty” is a 
movie about awful 
people doing awful 
things to a man 
for awful reasons. 
That 
somehow 

only manages to 
scratch the surface 
of what is wrong 
with this film.

Even if one were 

able to get past 
this facade for the 
sake 
of 
getting 

an 
audience 
it 

wouldn’t 
get 

otherwise, the rest of “Collateral 
Beauty” 
hardly 
does 
itself 

any favors. The last act of this 
film packs in two of the most 
spectacularly ill-advised twists 
in recent memory. A good twist 
is hinted at throughout the movie 
but still hard to see coming. 
It contributes added depth to 
additional viewings. There is 
none of this in “Collateral Beauty” 
because to even hint at these 

twists would push the movie 
into the realm of unintentional 
comedy, 
and 
director 
David 

Frankel 
(“The 
Devil 
Wears 

Prada”) wisely decided to save 
that for the third act, presumably 
to minimize audience walkouts.

The lazy and/or nonsensical 

plotting 
might 
have 
been 

forgivable or at least overlooked if 
there were likeable characters to 
latch on to, but as was mentioned 
before, there’s none of that 
either. Contrary to what the 
trailers and posters may have 

implied, the movie 
doesn’t 
center 

around 
Howard 

(Will 
Smith, 

“Men 
in 
Black”) 

as much as it does 
his friends, Whit 
(Edward 
Norton, 

“Birdman”), Simon 
(Michael 
Peña, 

“The 
Martian”) 

and Claire (Kate 
Winslet, 
“Steve 

Jobs”). “Collateral 
Beauty” desperately 

wants its audience to believe that 
these people are Howard’s best 
friends and that they care about 
his wellbeing, but every action 
they make says otherwise. What 
arcs they have are cliché, bland, 
and unfocused, so even when 
they aren’t unlikeable, they’re 
simply boring.

None of the blame for this can 

be said to rest on the all-star cast, 
though. Will Smith absolutely 

shines as Howard in a movie that 
doesn’t deserve him. The scene-
stealer here, though, is without 
a doubt Helen Mirren (“Eye in 
the Sky”), who was cast as the 
physical manifestation of Death 
in a stroke of casting genius. Her 
scenes are never as touching and 
poignant as the movie thinks they 
are, but they’re at least something 
approaching funny, and Mirren 
manages to add wit and likability 
to her part which is more than 
can be said for the rest of the 
characters. Everyone on screen 
is doing their best, but they can’t 
save this script.

Ultimately, the biggest problem 

that “Collateral Beauty” faces 
is that it truly thinks it is saying 
something different. It thinks it is 
a work of genius that will be used 
for years to come to help grieving 
parents. 
Nothing 
could 
be 

further from the truth. Whether 
the fault lies with Frankel or 
screenwriter Allan Loeb (“The 
Switch”), the movie they have 
created together mostly peddles 
the 
same 
overly 
sentimental 

messages that movies like this 
usually do. The difference here is 
that the combination of repellent 
characters and laughter-inducing 
twists are borderline offensive 
to those who have lost a child. 
Based on its cast, “Collateral 
Beauty” could have and should 
have been the exemplification 
of the “touching holiday movie.” 
Instead, it settles for being some 
of the worst the genre has to offer.

FILM REVIEW


6 — Wednesday,January 4, 2016
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

There’s an acute heartbreak 

when something you love doesn’t 
receive the recognition you know 
it deserves. It’s a dagger in your 
overflowing heart. This year, that 
album was Pinegrove’s debut 
Cardinal, a refreshing blend of 
folky indie-rock that failed to 
reach the radar of most of Daily 
Music’s 
staff. 

As 
Pinegrove 

sing themselves: 
“How come every 
outcome’s such a 
comedown?”

Cardinal 
is 

a 
collection 

of eight songs 
which 
embody 

the 
art 
of 

emotional 
construction 
in 
music. 
It 

explores self-doubt, uncertainty 
and the search for a voice. It 
achieves tenderness in baring 
these emotions, and over the 
30-minute journey it fleshes 
them out through the dynamism 
in each individual track.

Pinegrove’s music is pure 

magic because it creates a sense 
of understanding, while feeling 
fresh and unfamiliar at the same 
time. The band and its music is 
a like brooding, misunderstood 
kid who you feel like you, and 
only you, completely understand 
— a poem personally written for 
your unraveling.

Pinegrove also knows exactly 

when to switch gears, uplifting 
with resounding bridges and 
coming 
down 
with 
tender 

melodies. The band is able to 
create 
imagery 
that’s 
vivid, 

but never fully tangible to the 
listener. It’s beauty comes from 
that feeling of unattainability, 
found in the music’s ambiguity.

Cardinal is full of these 

magical moments, where I was 
often completely consumed by 
the emotion the music translated. 
It’s 
shocking 
how 
perfectly 

their 
individual 
instruments 

and 
voices 
blend 

into 
harmony. 

Take “Aphasia,” for 
example: it climaxes 
with the pure gang 
vocals of “One day I 
won’t need your love 
/ one day I won’t 
define myself by the 
one I’m thinking 
of,” 
delivering 
a 

stunning 
desire 

for 
self-worth 
in 

the 
form 
of 
an 

emotional sucker punch that is 
entirely relatable, but sonically 
unfamiliar.

The 
band’s 
true 
charm 

comes from their ability to 
use their indie vibe to make 
the insecurities of emo music 
accessible. You would expect 
lyrics like “I saw your boyfriend 
at the Port Authority / it’s a sort 
of fucked up place” in a pop-
punk song, not on a country-
esque indie rock album. Cardinal 
is transcendent in that it’s bred 
from 
punk 
sensibilities 
and 

within the punk scene, but is still 
well received by pretty much 
anyone with functional hearing.

Examined with a critical 

ear, 
Cardinal 
becomes 
a 

wonderful bouquet of sounds. 

Twinkly guitars dance amongst 
underpinning rhythm chords, 
tempos falter and hasten on 
quick whims, all underneath 
lyricism 
that 
is 
sometimes 

cryptic, and sometimes blunt to 
the point of surprise.

“Cadmium,” a song inspired 

by “I Send You this Cadmium 
Red, ” a book of correspondence 
between artists John Berger 
and John Christie, discusses 
non-verbal expression and it’s 
inner turmoil, along with the 
difficulty of self-expression and 
its 
subsequent 
vulnerability. 

The album cover is also inspired 
by the book, and Pinegrove 
borrows heavily from its theme 
of 
communication 
through 

art. Evan Stephens Hall cries 
out on the chorus, “Say what 
it is / it’s so impossible / but if 
I just say what it is / it tends 
to sublimate away.” At once 
poetic 
and 
straightforward, 

Hall’s lyrics are relatable at 
the most personal level. Hall 
wants to better express himself 
in his art, a daunting task until 
accomplished.

On 
Cardinal, 
Pinegrove 

achieves some of the highest 
level of emotional expression 
in 
music 
today. 
Through 

expertly crafted composition, 
reverberating vocals and starkly 
human lyrics, Pinegrove finds 
their niche and makes their 
voices heard. Most impressively, 
the 
album 
transforms 
what 

might 
be 
surprising 
and 

meticulous music into some of 
the most approachable tunes 
of 2016. It’s an album that 
should’ve had everyone’s radar 
going haywire.

Don’t Sleep on Pinegrove

Damien Chazelle loves jazz. 

It would seem, after writing and 
directing three films dedicated 
to the music, it’s his entire life’s 
purpose to renew interest in 
the genre. First there was “Guy 
and Madeline on a Park Bench,” 
a 
grainy 
black-and-white 

musical, then his breakout 
film, “Whiplash,” a tale of 
an aspiring jazz drummer’s 
stunning 
descent 

into 
madness 

at 
the 
hands 

of 
a 
psychotic 

instructor. 
And 

now, there’s “La 
La Land,” a jazz 
musical and lovely 
throwback to the 
’40s and ’50s films 
of Gene Kelly, as 
well as the ’60s 
wave 
of 
French 

musicals. 
It’s 
a 

film so delightful 
— and with an 
ending 
sequence 

so spectacular — that it’s 
impossible to resist its grasp.

“La La Land” is set in 

Hollywood over the course 
of one year as two struggling 
artists — Mia Dolan (Emma 
Stone, “Birdman”), an actress, 
and Sebastian Wilder (Ryan 
Gosling, “The Nice Guys”), a 
jazz pianist — repeatedly cross 
paths and fall in love. Chazelle’s 
Hollywood is a bottleneck 
of talent. The opening of the 
film is a technically audacious 
dance number on the jammed 
Los Angeles Freeway, with 
aspiring 
singers, 
actors, 

writers 
and 
everyone 
in 

between 
literally 
jumping 

out of their cars at rapidly 
changing opportunities. Mia 
and Sebastian are consumed by 
their own troubles; Mia never 
finds 
success 
in 
auditions, 

while Sebastian wants to revive 
his beloved genre by opening 
a jazz club, but doesn’t have a 
steady job. The duo’s mutual 
commiseration over their craft 
blossoms into love.

The middle third of the film 

meanders through Mia and 
Sebastian’s romance as their 
relationship starts to strain. 
The music dies out as Sebastian 
goes on the road with a band 
started by an old friend, Keith, 
played by distinguished R&B 
artist John Legend, and the 
film begins to feel a bit slow. But 
on second viewing, the middle 
segment plays more as an 
eloquent rubato, hastening and 
slowing to fit the narrative’s 
needs. The film doesn’t drag; 

it’s 
deliberate. 

Nothing 
is 

particularly 
unnecessary (in 
fact, if anything 
I wanted to see 
more of Mia’s 
struggles 
to 

launch her one-
woman 
show), 

and with acting 
as 
sublime 
as 

that 
by 
Stone 

and Gosling, it’s 
pretty hard to 

feel bored.

Chazelle’s 

writing 
is 

excellent, taking 
the 
film 
from 

tenderness 
to 

the 
heights 

of 
comedy 
in 

mere 
minutes, 

if not seconds. 
The characters, 
especially 
the 

secondary 
and 
tertiary 

characters, 
are 

fully 
developed 

within 
a 
line 

or two, but all 
are 
endlessly 

complex. 
As 

for 
Mia 
and 

Sebastian, 
there’s a bit of an 
imbalance; 
the 

film may begin 
with Mia, and we may see the 
world through her eyes, but 
Sebastian is given more of an 
opportunity to share his craft. 
We see him play constantly, 
even an entire performance (of 

a phenomenal song written and 
performed by Legend) with 
The Messengers, Keith’s band, 
while Mia’s one-woman show 
is omitted.

Chazelle 
shot 
the 
film 

in 
Cinemascope, 
a 
grand 

widescreen 
technology 

predominant 
in 
the 
1950s, 

when Hollywood churned out 
large-scale epics one after 
the other. It’s a great idea in 
“La La Land,” a film that has 
a fair amount of spectacle, 
but 
even 
more 
intimacy. 

These characters dream in 
Cinemascope. 
Mia 
sleeps

FILM REVIEW

The “Star Wars” revival is 

in full-force, but for many, the 
Force never died. Last year, fans 
were bestowed with “The Force 
Awakens,” one of the best films 
in the series since “Return of 
the Jedi.” With Episodes VIII 
and IX still to come, along with 
Han Solo and Boba Fett spin-
off movies, fans can anticipate 
lots of entertaining content. 
Although some feel anxious 
about the new movies mostly 
due to the lackluster prequel 
trilogy, it seems the world 
is in for a future filled with 
intergalactic 
bliss. 
“Rogue 

One” is the beginning of what 
could be a supply of satisfying 
Star Wars anthology movies.

“Rogue One” is essentially 

Episode 3.5; it takes place 
after the Jedi-genocide, but 
before 
the 
introduction 
of 

Luke 
Skywalker. 
Although 

most characters are new, there 
are some familiar faces. Darth 
Vader (voiced again by James 
Earl Jones ) and 
a 
realistic 
CGI 

version of Grand 
Moff Tarkin (Guy 
Henry 
“Harry 

Potter 
and 
the 

Deathly Hallows”) 
play minor roles 
in 
the 
story, 

though both have 
enough 
screen 

time 
to 
satisfy 

longtime 
fans. 

New protagonists 
Jyn 
Erso 

(Felicity 
Jones, 

“The Theory of 
Everything”) 
and 
Cassian 

Andor 
(Diego 
Luna, 
“Y 

Tu 
Mamá 
También”) 
act 

as 
multidimensional 
and 

convincing heroes to root for in 
their fight against the Empire. 
Alan Tudyk (“Zootopia”) voices 

K-2SO, 
an 
Imperial 
droid 

reprogrammed 
to 
fight 
for 

the rebels, who is one of the 

best 
additions 

to 
the 
“Star 

Wars” 
series. 

Like C-3PO, he 
balances intellect 
and 
cynicism 

perfectly, and his 
cheesy jokes and 
sassy 
remarks 

make K-2SO one 
of the funniest 
“Star 
Wars” 

characters 
to 

date.

Unlike 
other 

“Star 
Wars” 

movies, there is 
an 
overarching 

sense 
of 
doom 

and imminent failure. “Rogue 
One” shows a struggling Rebel 
Force that does not have the 
means to defend itself against 
enemy forces. Other movies in 
the series tend to have a sense 

of hope, even in situations 
least deserving of it. “Rogue 
One” shows glimpses of it, but 
remains the gloomiest in the 
series.

The story of 

“Rogue One” is 
complex while 
remaining 
coherent. 
Someone 
who 

has never seen 
a “Star Wars” 
movie 
could 

pick up the plot 
just 
as 
easily 

as 
a 
diehard 

fanatic, though 
the latter may 
find the minor 
nuances 
more 

enjoyable. 
Among 
the 

intense 
battle 

scenes and stunning settings, 
“Rogue 
One” 
challenges 

the idea that in the cosmic 
fight between good and evil, 

the line between right and 
wrong, is clear. The “good 
guys” in the movie are a group 
varying from Imperial pilots 
to 
reprogrammed 
Imperial 

droids 
and 

disobedient 
Rebel soldiers. 
“Rogue One” is 
the first “Star 
Wars” 
movie 

to show a two-
sided 
Rebel 

Force that is 
not strictly a 
representation 
of good.

“Rogue 

One” 
diverts 

enough 
from 

the 
typical 

“Star 
Wars” 

formula while 
remaining 

faithful to the tropes that 
make them so fun. Fans will 
be relieved that no Jar Jar 
Binks 
replicas 
or 
cringe-

worthy romantic subplots are 
introduced. 
Every 
addition 

is justified and fits into the 
“Star Wars” timeline perfectly. 
Still, since the movie is not 
a part of the main series, 
more could have been done to 
distinguish it from the others. 
This was a golden opportunity 
for director Gareth Edwards 
(“Godzilla”) 
to 
incorporate 

some unique cinematography 
and 
experimentation 
that 

would have made it clearer that 
“Rogue One” is just an addition 
to the series. In many ways, 
“Rogue One” plays it too safe. 
Nonetheless, the special effects 
provide a thrill.

“Rogue One” is certainly not 

the best “Star Wars” movie, but 
it’s a welcomed addition to the 
franchise. Diehard fans now 
have some material to keep 
them happy until the eighth 
installment is released in 2017. 
Until then, expectations are 
high for what’s to come. 

“One” is satisfyingly safe

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | NOVEMBER 30, 2016

the personal and painful of the opioid epidemic


H

ey, you.

How’s it hanging back there? 

Is the weather all right? Have you fallen 
victim to any wandering eyes recently? 
Who am I kidding, of course you have. I 
have felt many a strange glance searing in 
your direction as of late (read: cuffing sea-
son, and the like).

I am not here to mock your unusual 

width, nor your circumference. I have no 
desire to poke fun at your stretch marks, 
hard-earned by a body that I am still learn-
ing to love. No, my dear friend and favored 
appendage, I am writing to you today to 
say thank you.

You have granted me the gift of resil-

ience, both physical and mental. I have 
always given you the respect and care you 
deserve and have subsequently become 
known as the squat queen at my local 
CrossFit gym. Not even the longest of wall 
sits can conquer your prowess. On the 
emotional side of the spectrum, your has 
taught me to turn the other cheek (this was 
not intended to become a pun, but now that 
it is one, I’m running with it) in uncom-
fortable situations. For better or worse, 
you have given me no choice but to learn 
to walk calmly past every catcaller, to hop 
through whatever means of public tran-
sit in order to shield you from a drunken 
stranger’s grip. No one should have to face 
such encounters, let alone dodge them on a 
regular basis, but this world’s inhabitants 
are far from perfect. While I have trained 
you to endure temporary bodily pain, you 
have trained me to use the faults of those 
around me as a means of growing stronger.

Thank you for assisting me in my 

romantic ventures. I know that sounds 
crazy — well, it would if you had ears 
— but hear me out. Silly as it may sound, 
you have served as an excellent means of 
experimentation in the world of teenage 
love affairs. Thanks to you, separating the 
good boys from the bad has become mere 
child’s play. If my date still calls me beau-
tiful when I cover you with a loosely fit-
ted skirt, I will likely hold him in better 
standing than someone who only gives me 

the time of day when I’m on my way back 
from yoga. You have forced me to search 
for a significant other who sees in me all 
that I see in myself, as opposed to just the 
back of me. In turn, your prominence has 
provoked months of self-searching, during 
which time I have realized you are not the 
only part of me worth appreciating.

To that end, you have shown me that the 

best things in life are not consequences of 
my outward appearance, and for that I am 

eternally grateful. Your ever-present vol-
ume has granted me only a slew of short-
lived football-player flings, none of which 
will ever compare to the joys brought about 
by my own abilities. I am more proud of my 
writing, my athletic feats, and my academ-
ic achievements than I am of your chance 
appearance in my life. You have convinced 
me that no amount of hollow compliments 
will guarantee me a sense of self-worth; 
rather, confidence is a trait I must fight to 
acquire on my own.

It has taken all of my adolescence to 

come to terms with you. You have made 
every pair of skinny jeans a conquest, 
every bar stool an unreliable failure. Yet 
you have taught me not to sell myself 
short, that Tess Garcia is more than 
just “the girl with the big situation back 
there.” She is bold, she is smart and she 
is powerful in both body and mind. No 
derogatory slur will tarnish my confi-
dence, nor will any shallow compliment 
inflate it.Your full-figured being is a con-
sistent reminder of all that I need to push 
myself through everyday life. The best 
part? You are literally just a butt. I don’t 
know when my backside took a front seat 
in my life, but I sure am glad it did.

With love, gratitude, and absolutely no 

shame,

Tess

P.S. — About the football player who 

told you you were small … let’s forget 
about him.

et’s set the record straight: The term “soccer” 
didn’t originate in the America. Rather, it first 
appeared in England, and by some records it pre-

dates the word “football” by about 18 years. So why does 
the rest of the world hate Americans for calling football 
“soccer?”

Well, I, for one, was born and raised in Pakistan. Where 

— like most places around the world — football referred to 
the sport where only goalkeepers were allowed to use their 
hands. I mean, it makes sense to me and it makes sense to 
everyone else in the world. I’m sure it makes sense to most 
Americans, too. In fact, the more I think about it, I realize 
the word “soccer” by itself doesn’t annoy me as much. It’s 
the fact that the word “football” is reserved for another 
sport where barely anyone uses his feet to touch the ball, 
and my — and the world’s — beloved football has to settle 
with being called “soccer.”

Growing up, I never had much against the major sports in 

the United States. Hockey was always cool; I skipped classes 
at school to play basketball. It wasn’t cricket, but even when 
I didn’t know what was happening, I always appreciated 
baseball. Heck, I’ve probably been to more pro-baseball 
games than any other sport now.

But I had always harbored an unreasonable dislike for 

American football. I made fun of it, the Internet made fun of 
it too and thousands of memes were made over it. Couldn’t 
they have picked a different name? (Just Google “handegg” 
for me.)

I remember applying to University of Michigan for 

the sole reason that it was a top-20 school on the various 
university rankings I checked senior year of high school. I 
came in knowing close to nothing about the University, Ann 
Arbor or its culture. When I got here I found out it was an 
American football school, and apparently a great one at that.

Three seasons worth of sitting in the Big House later I can 

proudly say American football has grown on me. Somewhere 
between all the tailgates, chanting “The Victors” with a 
sore throat, a fumbled punt, the man with the khaki pants, 
watching it snow in the Big House and JT Barrett’s first 
down (he was short!), this sport found its way into my heart.

I never thought it would happen. Seventeen-year-old-me 

would probably be “bitterly disappointed” in me right now, 
but truth be told, I couldn’t help it. American football is 
actually pretty neat. One jam-packed with the star names, 
the fan following, the heartbreaks and all the ecstasy one 
can expect from a major sport.

In retrospect, I never really hated it for not making much 

sense to me, or for it not being as rough and physical as 

rugby. My only quarrel was with the name.

I guess that’s what my relationship with America has 

always been like though — a gripe with the smaller things 
and indifference for the more mundane.

Like, why can’t price tags just include tax value like they’re 

supposed to? Why does everything have to be sponsored by 
something? Why is everything so commercialized? Why do 
I always have to wear a seat belt? Why are speeding fines 
more than $2? OK, wait. The last two make a lot more sense 
than I want them too. Why do Americans pronounce France 
like ranch, and not like flan? Why do they say Porsche, and 
not Porsche-uh?

And oh yeah, and let’s not forget the big one. Why can’t 

they just call football “football?”

But there are certain aspects of American life I’ve come 

to grudgingly accept. I’ll drive on the right side of the road 
now, for example, or occasionally hit the wipers when I want 
to hit the indicator. It’s kind of convenient that I can spell 
“color” without the U now, and I guess it’s cool if everyone 
else shows up to class in sweatpants and a hoodie when I 
wear chinos and a cardigan.

I’ve been told I’m pretty stubborn, too. I still call football 

“football” — except when I have to change it to “soccer” 
when I cover the Michigan men and women’s soccer teams 
— and refer to the other one as American football. My phone 
gives me the temperature in Celsius; the wind speeds are in 
km/h. I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Full disclaimer: I really don’t hate America. Truth be 

told, other than the things I’m just too stubborn to change 
— and the foreign policy — I’ve really fallen in love with 
the country, and even more so the people in it. But I fear if 
Donald Trump ever read this far he’d deport me.

Here are some things I like about America: My closest 

friends are American. They taught me how to throw an egg-
shaped ball, how to get around Ann Arbor, how baseball 
works, and of course, how to play Euchre. They’ve made 
sure I’ve never felt too homesick, that I have something to 
do for Spring Break, and they’ve always offered to have me 
over for the holidays — even though I have grandparents 
who live about an hour away.

In America, I’ve learned I have the luxury to skip classes 

without consequence and still do well in school. That when 
I order something at a restaurant I’ll get more than I could 
hope for. That Wi-Fi and LTE are better here than at home. 
That I’ll find people from Russia, Norway, Poland and 
everywhere else around the world living here. And above 
all, American Netflix is better than Netflix anywhere else.

I can’t be anything less than grateful to have been able to 

live somewhere new. Not that I dislike Pakistan or anything 
— I love Pakistan, and you should all take a trip given the 
chance. But I did things I could never have at home: I’ve 
gone kayaking, played American football, received an 
education from one of the best universities in the world, and 
met some really cool people along the way.

But at the end of the day, I’ll still always prefer football to 

American football. I’ve skipped quite a few Michigan games 
to watch Barcelona play a La Liga match. As much as I love 
Michigan football, I would trade a win against Ohio State if 
it meant Barcelona would win the next El Clasico.

I still find it amusing how the United States stops for the 

Super Bowl, when a Manchester United vs. Chelsea game 
in the Premier League would get almost five times the 
viewership. Or how it’s called the World Series, when no 
team outside North America really plays.

Even though I enjoy going to watch the Tigers and the 

Red Wings (but Little Caesars Arena, really?), I’m still a lot 
more likely to go to Yankee Stadium for the New York City 
Football Club than the Yankees — for the record David Villa, 
Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo are more popular across 
the world than any baseball player can hope to be.

Football has been a big part of my life ever since I can 

remember. I would sneak into the TV room at 12:45 at 
night to watch Champions League games on a school night, 
praying to God my mom wouldn’t catch me. I hated the fact 
that there was another sport with the same name as this 
one, but never thought I would enjoy it too.

In the same way Islamabad, Pakistan, will always be my 

home, and will forever be a part of me. I go back about once 
a year to catch up on what I’ve missed. My parents, siblings, 
childhood friends; the food, the environment, the culture;

The personal 
and painful 
of the opioid 
epidemic

M

onths ago, when I was assigned 
a story on the opioid epidemic, 
I was confronted with an 

entirely foreign concept: I didn’t even know 
if opioids were injected or ingested. And 
this was an epidemic? I couldn’t begin to 
understand how overdose deaths could be 
happening in my community.

On 
November 
23, 
I 
attended 
a 

community-wide event at St. Joseph Mercy 
Hospital in Ann Arbor that addressed the 
opioid epidemic and how to fight it, hosted 
by the Ypsilanti based addiction non-profit 
Dawn Farm.

From my aisle seat, I watched the 

auditorium fill with Ann Arbor and 
Ypsilanti residents, college students and a 
few families with younger kids. I watched 
intently, ready to scribble notes on trends 
in age groups, gender, appearance, or race. 
To my surprise, none of the categories 
followed a specific trend — there were 
no similarities among the people I saw 
whatsoever.

I was struck. There were people from all 

walks of life who were dealing with an issue 
in my community I hardly knew existed.

What I found was that in 2014, within 

Washtenaw County alone, there were 
65 reported opioid deaths according to 
the Washtenaw Health Initiative Opioid 
Project. Across the US, there are 78 deaths 
from opioid overdoses a day, putting the 
country at an all time high for opioid 
overdose deaths. This wasn’t another story 
which could be shoved aside for a later read, 
but something happening right now.

Opiates are a family of drugs for treating 

pain and affecting emotions. Common types 
include morphine, heroin, hydrocodone, 
and oxycodone, all of which are addictive. 
Opiates are commonly prescribed for 
suppressing pain after surgery, trauma, and 
various injuries.

At the event, I learned of the dramatic 

rise in opioid-related deaths in 2014, which 
spiked nationwide efforts to reduce this 
number, creating with initiatives such as the 
WHI Opioid Project and other public health 
models specific to overdose prevention 
and resuscitation after overdose. In some 
ways, it’s working. In 2015, there was a 25 
percent decrease in opioid overdose deaths 
in Washtenaw County.

The 
numbers 
may 
have 
decreased, 

but forty-nine deaths is still an all too 
significant number.

The forum, and conversations I would 

later have with a number of its speakers, 
informed me of how Washtenaw County 
is currently responding to the problem. 
WHI’s new public health-based model 
has raised local awareness for a national 
crisis, sparking community action among 
the police force, healthcare administrators, 
and overdose subject bystanders, who often 
play a critical role as first responders, 
saving lives. Saving lives is the goal: since 
August of 2015, more than 96 Washtenaw 
County police officers have been trained 
in the administration of naloxone, an 
opioid overdose reversal drug. And there 

have also been community classes on 
naloxone use, and the medication can now 
be co-prescribed to family and friends who 
are concerned of loved ones overdosing, so 
911 isn’t the only way to keep victims alive.

What was most surprising to me as 

a pre-health student was how little I 
knew about this prevalent problem, often 
rooted in the health industry, which was 
not only affecting the country as a whole 
but rampant in the community I lived 
in. Emotionally, the issue is comparably 
devastating to alcohol overdose or suicide. 
A death is a death. But I never encountered 
any information — no pamphlets, no emails 
— about the issue beforehand. For such a 
crisis, I was totally unprepared.

One of the speakers, Ashton Marr, is 

an Ann Arbor resident who has been in 
recovery for 12 years. When she was 19, she 
was prescribed Vicodin after an emergency 
appendectomy and from this introduction, 
her life began to spiral around opiates.

She sat in front of the auditorium with 

her purple Mohawk and matching color 
parka, among a panel of physicians, nurses, 
police officers, and other recoverers. When 
one of the audience members asked if the 
availability of an overdose counteractive 
drug would make opiate users likely to 
overdose just to be resuscitated, creating 
a false sense of security, Ashton shook 
her head. The row of silver hoops on her 
earlobes reflected against the spotlight, 
sending shards of light through the 
auditorium. When she spoke her voice was 
deep, but melodic.

“From my own experience in going 

through addiction, that thought never 
crossed my mind once and that certainly 
wasn’t the goal either. If naloxone knocks 
the opioids off of opioid receptors, then 
you eventually become dope-sick and that 
certainly wasn’t the goal,” she said. Opioid 
and heroin withdrawal symptoms are often 
referred to as “dope sick,” which urges the 
abuser to continue drug administration to 
combat discomfort. The symptoms include 
depression, anxiety, intense cramping, 
bone and muscle pain, involuntary leg 
movements, cold flashes, among others. 
“I was trying to tread the line between 
life and death, I wouldn’t want naloxone 
administered.”

Since her introduction to opiates after 

surgery, Ashton said the intense craving 
for more frequent and larger doses, a bigger 
and better high, began to consume her. As 
she entered community college, she isolated 
herself from her family and friends, mostly 
living from her car, miserable and ashamed: 
“It was like it just took over my life and 
my mind, and I really was up and running 
with opioids. I truly believed I was the only 
heroin addict in Ann Arbor.”

The chase for the ultimate high, the brink 

between the conscious and unconscious 
seems to be a mutual driver for continued 
users, and often the direct reason for 
overdose. And more surprisingly, the 
other common intersection between users 
and overdose survivors is the beginning 

of their addictive trends. The majority of 
opioid addiction start from a sports injury 
or general surgery where opiates are 
prescribed to alleviate immediate pain. 
The patient never gets weaned off the 
medication properly, instead developing a 
dependence on pain suppressors.

Another speaker at the panel, Stephen 

Strobbe, is a practicing nurse and founder 
of the WHI Opioid Project. Throughout 
the talk, he suspected a fundamental issue 
in the prescription system to be a leading 
cause for excess prescription and eventual 
drug misuse. According to Strobbe, there 
are enough written opioid prescriptions 
for each adult in the United States to have 
a bottle for themselves. When I mentioned 
I was a pre-health student at the University 
during our phone interview the morning 
of the panel, Strobbe said he would stay 
after the event to answer all questions – 
going above and beyond from personal 
to research to data-based inquiries – to 
spread awareness on the opioid epidemic. 
During our conversation, he reaffirmed 
the absence of stereotypes in the epidemic. 
There is no “type” for opioid users who 
experience addiction and overdose, besides 
being prescribed a medication, failing to be 
weaned off and then suddenly being in the 
middle a downwards spiral, often with no 
knowledge of who to go to for help.

Marr raised similar concerns on the 

prescribing behavior of physicians. After 
the forum, we sat in two corner seats of 
the empty auditorium. Like Strobbe, she 
offered to give any information to increase 
the public knowledge on the epidemic and 
its severity. “I’ve heard time and time again 
that it’s easier to write the prescription, 
as opposed to getting into conflict with 
somebody or fighting about it,” she said. 
“But the fact of the matter is they have 
the hand in the individual’s death if they 
let the addiction spiral. Doctors are in a 
position where they need to do no harm and 
give care to people, so it’s important that 
they understand how to treat addiction, 
recovery-related resources, how to safely 
prescribe to people, and how to treat pain.”

The physician-patient relationship plays a 

vital role in continuation or discontinuation 
of medication following a painful event, and 
the doctor’s choices can be the rate-limiting 
step to the addiction narrative. A majority, 
if not all, practicing physicians will at some 
point prescribe pain medications to their 
patients. One of the seeds to the epidemic 
could be immediately addressed in the 
hospital, but also the medical schools and 
undergraduate populations who will be the 
next prescribers within five to ten years. 
However, it may also be worth opening a 
discussion how much responsibility the 
doctor has over the patient. It cannot 
entirely be the doctor’s fault if the patient 
decides to misuse their prescribed dose, 
and the doctor cannot always neglect the 
patient of pain medication to alleviate their 
symptoms. These ethical questions do not 
have a simple answer to solve the problem.

So clearly I never pictured a reality where 

opioid addiction and overdose death was 
something real and proximal, something 
that could affect my relatives, family or 
friends.

A 
majority, 
if 
not 
all 
practicing 

physicians will at some point prescribe pain 
medications to their patients. One of the 
roots of the epidemic could be immediately 
addressed in the hospital, certainly, but 
also in the medical schools and even 
undergraduate programs, whose students 
will be the next prescribers within five to 
ten years. But it may also be worth opening 
a discussion of how much responsibility 
the doctor has over the patient. It cannot 
entirely be the doctor’s fault if the patient 
decides to misuse their prescribed dose, 
and the doctor cannot always refuse the 
patient pain medication to alleviate their 
symptoms — in many cases it is necessary. 
These ethical questions do not have a 
simple solutions.

Strobbe 
said 
another 
common 

intersection between users and overdose 
survivors is the beginning of their addiction. 
The majority of opioid addictions start 
from a sports injury or general surgery, 
when opiates are prescribed to alleviate 
immediate pain and the patient never 
gets weaned off the medication properly, 
instead developing a dependence on pain 
suppressors.

In light of all of this, I picture my best 

friend. I picture her brown ringlets of 
effortless curls falling down her shoulders 
and the black-rimmed glasses she wears 
that rest on her cheeks. The studious one 
of all of us, who has (maybe) gotten one B 
in college, organizes all of our volunteer 
events for the fraternity, and laughs five 
times more often than she frowns.

I never realized that she dealt with this 

crisis first hand. Again, an epidemic so 
widespread was lost to me. 

This makes me sift through my entire 

memory since the day I met her, the things 
we talked about, the secrets we shared. It 
never occurred to me that her own sister 
was a victim of this crisis. That she was a 
part of this silenced group, when she was so 
present in my life.

I told my best friend about this article, 

and I asked her about the issue at hand: the 
pain which leads people across the country, 
across the world, to opioid addiction.

“I’ve really never thought about it before. 

I guess it’s different for everyone, like the 
origin of it,” she said. “But it’s the twisting 
torment, that’s builds up in your stomach 
and leaks into your heart and head and eyes 
until it’s all you feel, see and think about. 
It lays dormant until you think it’s gone, or 
at least a little less, and then a tidal wave 
of emotions hit and it’s like, you’re there 
again, at the very first moment you felt it. 
It’s always with you. I think we just learn 
how to control it, regardless of its love or 
loss or whatever else it stems from.”

You can’t tell me Tylenol will take that 

away.

he common explanation post-
11/8/2016 includes some kind 
of combination of the terms 

“white,” “angry,” “xenophobic” and “racist” 
— the list is familiar, and not entirely unfair. 
White Americans did, quite factually, vote 
for Donald Trump in resounding numbers 
in the general election. According to an 
exit poll conducted by Edison Research 
for the National Election Pool, 58 percent 
of white non-hispanic voters cast ballots 
for Trump, in comparison to 37 percent for 
his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton. This is a reality.

But there are many faces to that reality, 

even if they’re not always distinguished 
clearly in coverage. That’s a mistake 
easy to see on social media outlets like 
Twitter, where 62 percent of adults get 
their news, according to a recent survey 
by Pew Research millenials. When many-
faceted political issues like the Trump 
election are simplified into 140 characters 
or highlighted videos, the result is rarely 
nuanced.

Match 
that 
with 
an 
ever-growing 

atmosphere of partisanship, and what 
we get is a this-or-that-side anger. There 
is no room for a middle; there is no 
conversation to be had. Right after the 
election, feeds were filled with variations 
of “fuck white people,” or some kind of 
derogatory meme of a poor white hillbilly 
or redneck. This anger is understandable 
given the rhetoric of the election. Many 
in our country feel explicitly targeted, and 
racism, xenophobia and white anger are all 
relevant contributing factors to this.

The problem is when our explanations 

refuse to accept another. On one side, 
there’s childish, haughty “I told you so” 
rhetoric from Trump’s supporters, which 
refuses to acknowledge those very real 
concerns of minorities in this country, 
equating it all to “whining,” a privileged 
term to use for many who have never felt 
targeted in the same way as minorities in 
this country do, especially now. The other, 
though, has created monolithic categories 
for where to direct its own anger: white 
Americans, the poor, the uneducated. 
When terms like “working-class” and 
“inequality” 
are 
introduced 
into 
the 

conversation, accusations of normalizing 
are thrown easily. Acknowledging one 

reality does not take away from another. 
We can understand that important social 
progress in our country — gay rights, racial 
equality, immigrant rights, etc. — is at risk, 
while still recognizing that there are issues 
beyond social discomfort at this progress 
that drove poor white Americans to the 
polls.

J.D. Vance’s memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” 

released in June, tackles these forgotten 
(or simply eschewed) realities. His story is 
a painful and relevant one.

Raised partly in Rust Belt Middletown, 

Ohio, and partly in Appalachian Jackson, 
Kentucky, Vance’s family is by nature a 
kind of representation for problems of 
those regions. He describes his family as 
“Hillbilly Royalty” — that is not on account 
of their wealth, which is hardly existent, 
but because of how Vance’s ancestors were 
known as some of the hardest, most loyal 
people in the area. These words require 
clarification: Loyalty, to this group, means 
attacking a man with an electric saw who 
insults his mother, or forcing another 
to eat a pair of underpants for making a 
lewd comment about his sister. This is 
what Vance calls “Hillbilly Justice,” and 
it’s just the first introduction to a world 
whose regularities are miles different than 
many Americans’, especially the college-
educated. His people are not part of some 
mythically comfortable “middle class.”

Vance understands that the romanticizing 

of this kind of violence is indicative of 
deeper problems in the community. It 
creates a culture that its children nearly 
inevitably fall into. While Vance himself 
has by most measures largely escaped the 
fate of so many of his peers, he discusses 
how this kind of internalized violence 
remains: Driving down the road with his 
wife, he nearly exited his car after someone 
honked their horn at him, ready to fight. 
This isn’t what might first come to mind 
as Yale Law School graduate behavior. But 
it’s normal for the people of his upbringing, 
and emphasizes how this kind of behavior 
doesn’t just immediately disappear when 
financial problems are less apparent.

Context here is everything, and Vance 

does not put forth these kinds of “cultural” 
problems without giving at least some 
background for their existence. For one, 
there is the overwhelming sense in these 

pages that these are a stuck people. His 
grandparents, Mamaw and Papaw, grew 
up in rural Kentucky, where poor white 
families would feud and fight for survival. 
When they left for the Rust Belt for a better 
future, their assumption was that things 
would be different. Vance makes it clear 
from the start that they would not be.

Those problems, which plagued rural 

Kentucky, were just as present, if not more 
so, in rural Ohio. As the companies that were 
once the beaming hope for these towns — 
Armco Steel, Champion Paper and Fiber, 
Procter and Gamble, and National Cash 
Register — began to size down, outsource 
and lose money, their manufacturing jobs 
began to leave. The work that was there for 
parents would not be there for their kids. 
That dream of upward mobility for those 
who left one impoverished, rural area for 

another was just that: a dream.

The rut these families find themselves in 

leads to explicit expressions of anger, like 
violence, but also more inward ones, such 
as drug use and addiction. The latter has 
been a growing epidemic in towns like the 
one Vance grew up in, as heroin and other 
kinds of opioids in particular have taken 
hold. This past summer 27 West Virginians 
overdosed in the city of Huntington 
within a four-hour span. When Vance’s 
own mother succumbed to this addiction, 
though after much other previous drug use 
and alcoholism, Vance recognizes this drug 
differently: “‘Heroin’ just has a certain ring 
to it; it’s like the Kentucky Derby of drugs,” 
he writes. Its specter is very real over these 
communities, and elicits a justifiable fear 
and anguish.

Hillbilly Elegy, 
on Campus 
and in a Trump America

and lack of mobility is at play in these 
communities, and it is not getting better. 
The cycle of poverty and devastation that 
many white Americans have been caught 
in is so large that it is affecting trends 
at a macro level. The New York Times, 
reporting on a study from 2015, found “The 
mortality rate for whites 45 to 54 years old 
with no more than a high school education 
increased by 134 deaths per 100,000 people 
from 1999 to 2014.” That is astonishing, 
given that “every other age group … every 
other racial and ethnic group” saw an 
increase in life expectancy. That fear and 
anguish may come, as some have termed, 
from a fear in the decline of their social 
standing, but that cannot encompass the 
entire span of this crisis. Poor white people 
are dying, quite literally.

Elections are won and lost almost always 

on economic lines. Though certainly not a 
perfect indicator of economic position, 
college education or lack thereof can be 
used as a rough outline of economic trends. 
Economic discrepancies between college 
graduates and those who did not attend 
college are obvious. And so was their 
voting in the 2016 election.

The 
Pew 
Research 
Center 
found 

“Trump’s margin among whites without 
a college degree is the largest among any 
candidate in exit polls since 1980. Two-
thirds (67%) of non-college whites backed 
Trump, compared with just 28% who 
supported Clinton, resulting in a 39-point 
advantage for Trump among this group.” 
The New York Times’ breakdown of exit 
polls makes the economic distinction even 
clearer. Among those making less than 
$30,000 annually, there was a 16-percent 
increase in voting for the Republican Party 
candidate from 2012 — for Donald Trump. 
Among those making $30,000 to $49,999 
a year, that shift was 6 percent. And 
though the shift was greatest among white 
Americans, there was actually a shift from 
2012 among all minorities toward Donald 
Trump, rather than away from him. So 
while it’s certainly true that affluent white 
Americans helped to elect Trump in this 
election, as they have for most Republican 
candidates in recent history, that is not the 
entirety of the story.

The specter, the fear, that has led 

poor Americans in general to a totally 
inexperienced, once-reality-television-star 
candidate isn’t limited to just the Rust Belt 
and Appalachian regions. Driving home 
down Aris T Allen Boulevard in Annapolis, 
Md., with a friend about two years ago, 
a woman appeared in the middle of the 
highway on her hands and knees. We pulled 
over, called the police and waited as the 
woman pulled herself together and hobbled 
to our car. When she came knocking on our 
window, telling us everything was fine (her 
face showed that it was not) and that all she 
needed was a ride to the Kmart, the police 

showed up and took her in. While we were 
in shock, the police officer was not. This 
was a common occurrence, he told us, as 
drug addicts would commonly use behind 
the nearby Safeway and occasionally find 
themselves standing in the middle of the 
highway. The drug, of course, was heroin.

Just a month after that incident, five 

heroin overdose victims were found 
in Annapolis on a single day. Though 
Annapolis proper is a relatively affluent 
— with a median household annual 
income of $75,320 dollars — the suburban 
areas around it are not necessarily, and 
Edgewater, where my high school is 
located, was known for intense drug use 
among the “white trash,” as they were 
often called. As kids, we loved to tell 
stories about how our neighboring middle 
school, Central Middle School — which I 
also attended — had frequent visits from 
the police, armed with dogs to sniff lockers 
for drugs. I didn’t think of the broader 
implications at the time, but as teachers 
became increasingly worried about the 
state of the school, my parents decided 
to send my younger brother to a private 
middle school far from our home.

They had that luxury, but most did not. 

Later in my high-school years, I went back 
to my middle school to tutor, and I got a 
glimpse at some of the realities J.D. Vance 
mentions. Kids were frequently distracted 
by what was going on in their home life, 
just as Vance described. He couldn’t 
study trigonometry knowing his mom was 
drugged out on the couch, or screaming 
at a new boyfriend. I worry the same was 
happening with these kids.

To be clear, my county, Anne Arundel 

County, voted for Hillary Clinton in 
this election, though by a thin margin 
of 116,074 votes to 114,509 votes. But 
through a highly unscientific survey of 
the town’s many Trump-Pence signs, and 
knowing the ideology of most of my friends 
from Edgewater, I’d be willing to bet 
Edgewater and the other poorer, largely 
white neighborhoods of Anne Arundel 
County went for Donald Trump. And these 
problems, which push the poor into protest 
votes, as with Donald Trump, are not getting 
better. According to The Baltimore Sun, in 
2016 “The number of drug- and alcohol-
related overdose deaths in Maryland in the 
first half of the year jumped more than 50 
percent from the same period last year.” In 
Michigan, the problem is the same. Heroin 
and opioid deaths have multiplied 10 times 
since 1999.

Drug use is not the only problem that 

Vance highlights with broader implications.

Vance expresses childhood anger at his 

mother’s various boyfriends, coming and 
going through a revolving door. “I loathed 
living with these strangers,” he writes, and 
it affects him more than just emotionally. 
His grades suffer without a stable home, 

and years later he would come across the 
psychological term “adverse childhood 
events” to describe his upbringing.

The issue of fatherhood, which Vance 

speaks to in his own life, reveals another 
bias. The crisis of “Black fatherhood” is 
often written about and discussed, but 
the same is not always said about white 
fatherhood. The prevalence of bad, or 
simply non-existent fathers in Vance’s poor 
white community shows us that the issue is 
not limited to Black communities.

Subverting and affirming stereotypes 

is one of Vance’s strongest achievements 
in this memoir. While he only implies 
this about Black fatherhood, he tackles 
others with both bluntness and reserve. 
Though his grandmother Mamaw is by no 
means the pinnacle of gay activism, she 
is clear on the subject when speaking to 
Vance: “even if you did want to suck dicks, 
that would be okay. God would still love 
you.” This is not what we might typically 
expect from a poor, rural, Christian, white 
woman. It betrays a political complexity 
that defeats simple narrative. It also leads 
into 
another 
stereotype 
complication 

— their relationship with God. The 
general understanding is that poor white 
Americans love God just as much as they 
do processed foods. But while his family 
and others might always talk about Jesus, 
he cites studies showing that “active 
church attendance (in the Bible Belt) is 
actually quite low.” What that relationship 
to God means is also highly malleable. 
Mamaw uses Christianity as a reason for 
why Christians should love the LGBTQ 
community. Vance’s experience with his 
father’s church was far different, and he 
explains that at those services, he “heard 
more about the gay lobby and the war 
on Christmas than about any particular 
character trait a Christian should aspire 
to have.” These are hugely different 
relationships with God, and reveal poor 
white Christians are not a monolithic 
group with singular views.

To be sure, Vance does gloss over some 

of the ugliest faces of his community, and 
feels hypocritical about others. According 
to Vance, white voters in his region did not 
detest Barack Obama solely for his race, 
but because of what he represented as a 
rich, highly educated citizen in our society. 
While that might be true, and while that 
might be a reason Hillary Clinton failed to 
reach this group of people, he touches on 
evidence that makes that shoulder brush 
seem less credible. When his cousin Gail 
announced she was pregnant by a Black 
man as a teen, the family shunned her. 
Nearly everyone in this family had children 
in their teens. But none of them, it seems, 
were Black. Vance approaches this with 
just a half paragraph, and it feels like he 
could have given this a bit more weight, 
particularly in light of how briefly he 

touched on the racism toward Obama.

Further, when he focuses his lens to 

others in his own community and beyond 
his own personal experiences, he fails to 
give them the context that he gives his own 
family. We understand why he struggled 
and was distracted in school, and we know 
why those in his family might be inclined 
to violence or drug use. He even addresses 
why his family would go out of their way 
to get the most expensive Christmas gifts 
possible, simply putting on the guise of 
comfortableness to be happy. When those 
around him, though, use welfare for treats 
such as cigarettes or liquor, he is harsh, 
and likens it to a community-wide crisis of 
laziness.

Still, 
his 
observations 
are 
largely 

moving and eye-opening. One that feels 
especially relevant here on campus lies in 
the hypocrisy of wealthy liberals talking 
about equality, yet still looking down 
on those in a different class from them. 
When he goes out with a group of friends 
to a late-night chicken restaurant and 
they leave a huge mess for the workers, 
only one other student stays back to help 
him clean up, and that student also came 
from a poorer background. I’ve seen the 
same at restaurants all around Ann Arbor. 
There is the sense here that it is easy to 
talk about economic equality on a macro 
level, but equally easy to ignore it when 
it’s right in front of you, on a micro level. 
An investigation by the Daily in 2014 found 
that “In Fall 2011, 63 percent of incoming 
freshmen reported family incomes over 
$100,000,” nearly twice the median family 
income in the United States. 

Taking that further, what does this 

mean for something like post-Trump vigils 
on campus? Though there were plenty 
of wealthy white men who voted for the 
morals of a misogynist, it’s also clear that 
many who voted for Trump will never 
experience a level of economic comfort 
that many of the most openly anti-Trump 
students on our own campus might. What 
does it mean, then, if a white student on 
campus with a family income of more than 
$250,000 attends such a vigil, and then 
tweets something derogatory about the 
poorer ones (coming back to those hillbilly 
memes) of their own race? Are these not 
in themselves expressions of privilege? 
These are hard questions which, as with 
all hard questions, do not have simple 
answers. There is without a doubt a reason 
for these kinds of protests. We on campus 
must remain allies for those who feel 
voiceless; we must protect our immigrant 
populations, be watchful for racism and 
homophobia, and condemn sexism. But 
we must also be cautious about criticizing 
entire 
demographics, 
and 
especially 

cautious that we do not fall into the 
mistake of unintentional classism. We can, 
for a start, read “Hillbilly Elegy.”

lost their conference opener 

in Iowa.

A new kind of 
disappointment

Michigan fans expected 
much more after such 
a promising start to the 
2016 season.
» Page 2C

When Mike McCray dove over 

the pylon in the final minute of 
the third quarter, the Michigan 
sideline erupted in cheers. It 
was the first time a Wolverine 
found the end zone at Hard Rock 
Stadium, and it breathed life into 
the Michigan football team that 
was now within a score of the 
Seminoles.

It didn’t matter that it came 

from a defensive player, or that it 
took nearly 45 minutes of game 
time to score a touchdown. It only 
mattered that the momentum was 
starting to shift in the Wolverines’ 
favor.

Michigan 
rode 
that 
wave 

throughout the fourth quarter 
— its most impressive quarter of 
football at the Orange Bowl, and 
not by a small margin. At the end of 
the third quarter, the Wolverines 
had just 135 total offensive yards 
— exactly half the number the 
Seminoles racked up in that time 
frame. But in the fourth, Michigan 
picked up 107 yards and gained 
the lead for the first time all game, 
only to lose by one point, 33-32, 
after Florida State wide receiver 
Keith Gavin returned the ball 66 
yards to put the Seminoles within 
striking distance.

After 
the 
first 
half 
the 

Wolverines put together, it was 
almost surprising that it took 
the Seminoles until the end of 
the game to lock down the win. 
Michigan sputtered to a 20-6 
first-half score that included 
just six first downs and two field 
goals, and its early woes might 
be placed on a combination of 
poor quarterback protection and 
timing.

“I’ve never played quarterback, 

but I couldn’t imagine being 
back there, just sitting, and then 
having the pocket just collapse 
or having blitzers coming in,” 
said senior wide receiver Amara 
Darboh. “And then I slipped on 
a couple routes that I shouldn’t 
have, couldn’t get my foot in, so 
a little bit of both.”

Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight said 
after the game that his internal 
clock in the pocket was a little 
too quick in the first half. But in 
the second frame, he had a better 
read after getting much-needed 
protection.

“Yeah, 
we 
turned 
things 

around,” 
Speight 
said. 

“The 
defense 
made 
a 

lot of key stops in the 
second half, which gave 
the momentum to the 
offense. We just had 
to get a couple of 
first downs, a couple 
completions, and then 
eventually pound it in 
the end zone.”

Even 
after 

Nyqwan 
Murray 

pulled in a 12-yard 
touchdown 
pass 

from quarterback 
Deondre 
Francois 
with 

just 1:21 left in 
the game, the 
Wolverines 
never felt like it 
was over.

On 
Michigan’s 

touchdown drive just 
over a minute earlier, 
freshman running back 
Chris 
Evans 
showed 
a 

glimpse of what the future 
might look like after cracking 
open the game with a 30-yard 
touchdown run.

“Well, 
like 
a 
run 
game 

sometimes does, it can get 
stopped and you keep pounding 
away at it and keep chipping 
away at it and then you start 
making the four-yard gains 
and then the six-yard gains 
and then the 10-yard gains, and 
then finally, we popped one 
there with Chris Evans,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“The way I feel about it is it was 
a heck of a game.”

That energy carried over, 

and despite Florida State’s final 
touchdown, Michigan was still 
in the game for the long haul. 
On the extra point attempt, 
freshman safety Josh Metellus 
scooped up a blocked kick and 
ran it back for two points to 
put the Wolverines within one 
point.

It was finally too little too 

late 
for 
Michigan, 
though, 

when 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight’s 
pass was intercepted with just 
16 seconds left in the game on 
fourth down.

“I felt like we all believed,” 

Darboh said. “We came in 
the locker room, we made 
adjustments, and we said the 
second half was going to be our 
half. Unfortunately, we didn’t 

start 
the 
game 
the 
way 

we 
should 

have and the 
way we planned 
to. That’s big in 
football. You have 
to 
jump 
on 
your 

opponent. 
We 
didn’t 

do that. But I thought we 
came back in the second half 
and fought hard.”

Darboh 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

Wolverine 
that 
thought 

Michigan 
had 
recovered. 

Speight also believed that the 
Wolverines “bounced back,” but 
it evidently wasn’t enough when 
the Seminoles pulled on their 
freshly-printed Orange Bowl 
championship T-shirts and hats.

Even 
though 
Michigan 

flipped the script on its regular-
season losses, in which the 
Wolverines failed to contribute 
in the fourth quarter, they still 
hadn’t adjusted enough to close 
out the final frame.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan in search of 
first conference win

Michigan coach John Beilein is 

on the brink of a benchmark.

After dropping its Big Ten 

opener to Iowa in overtime, 86-83, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team has returned home with an 
opportunity to give Beilein his 
200th career win in its matchup 
against Penn State (1-1 Big Ten, 
9-6 overall) on Wednesday night. 

The loss to the Hawkeyes 

wasn’t an easy pill to swallow, as 
the Wolverines (0-1, 10-4) came a 
non-foul call and four points shy of 
notching their first win in Carver-
Hawkeye Arena since 2011.

“We got through yesterday,” 

Beilein said. “Rough day after 
watching that Iowa game and 
knowing that there were moments 
(when) it was ours for the taking. 
We couldn’t finish it.

“… The same thing happened 

to (No. 14) North Carolina, to 
(No. 8) Duke, to Syracuse, to Ohio 
State, to Purdue. The same thing 
happened when you go into a 
game and you believe you can go 
in there and win a game, and you 
don’t. That’s exactly the message 
to the team yesterday, that there 
are 17 games left in the league and 
we gotta grow from it.”

The first of those 17 comes 

against the Nittany Lions, who 
have experienced an up-and-
down season through their first 
15 games.

While Penn State has lost at 

the hands of teams like George 
Mason and Albany, it still boasts 
impressive 
wins 
against 
St. 

John’s and Georgia Tech — which 
defeated then-No. 13 Butler and 
then-No. 9 North Carolina in the 
last week, respectively.

Guard Shep Garner leads the 

Nittany Lions with 13.2 points per 
game, and forward Mike Watkins 
averages the most rebounds with 
8.3 per game. Still, Penn State 
doesn’t boast a true marquee 
scorer, with each member of its 
starting five averaging double-
digits. 

“They have a great mixture of 

two talented kids (Tony Carr and 
Lamar Stevens) from the same 
Roman Catholic high school in 
(Philadelphia) that really have 
infused them with some young 
talent,” Beilein said. “And then 
they got some holdovers that have 
gained a lot of experience through 
wins and losses over the last two 
or three years. So it’s going to be a 
very difficult game for us.”

Michigan, though, seems to 

have enough pieces in place to 
notch its first conference win, 
especially with the emergence of 
DJ Wilson.

The 
redshirt 
sophomore 

forward scored a career-high 28 
points and cleaned up the glass 
to the tune of 14 rebounds against 
Iowa. Wilson is averaging 7.1 
rebounds on the year, and could 
prove to be stiff competition for 
Watkins in the paint.

“The coaches kind of just told 

me that it was going to happen 
in due time and I was kind of due 
for a game like that,” Wilson said. 
“But, I don’t know, I just try to 
stay consistent and as confident as 
possible and just let things work 
out for themselves.”

Though 
senior 
wing 
Zak 

Irvin struggled against Iowa, 
finishing with 12 points on 5-for-
15 shooting, he still leads the 
Wolverines with 13.9 points per 
game and will look to return to 
form against a Penn State team 
allowing 70.3 points per contest.

With Beilein’s milestone in 

reach, Michigan has a chance to 
make its first conference win a 
little more special. But the Nittany 
Lions certainly won’t roll over, 
and Beilein is fully aware of that.

“I’m 
only 
aware 
of 
(the 

milestones) when you guys say 
them,” he said. “…I don’t read 
(anything) other than the other 
team’s game notes. I’ll find out 
after the fact what happens.

“It’s just never been a thing 

with me in any way. I never 
considered it. (If) you’re in this 
a long time, you’re going to have 
some milestones, but it doesn’t 
mean it’s anything different the 
next day.”

Behind Enemy Lines: Nittany 
Lion coach Patrick Chambers

Coming off an overtime loss to 

Iowa to open conference play, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
will attempt to secure its first Big 
Ten win when it hosts Penn State 
on Wednesday. The Nittany Lions 
boast a consensus Top 15 freshman 
class, and two of them — forward 
Lamar Stevens and guard Tony 
Carr — have made an immediate 
impact, averaging 12.1 and 11.8 
points per game, respectively. 
Junior guard Shep Garner leads 
the team in scoring with an 
average of 13.8 and is second in 
total assists with 44 to Carr’s 59.

The Michigan Daily sat down 

with Penn State coach Patrick 
Chambers at Big Ten Media Day in 
October to talk about the strength 
of his current recruiting class 
and how their unique connection 
to Garner could serve them well 
throughout the season.

The Michigan Daily: Three 

of the freshmen on the team 
(Stevens, Carr and guard Nazeer 
Bostick) are from the same high 
school, Roman Catholic. How will 

that help the team’s chemistry 
given that they all have playing 
experience together?

Patrick Chambers: It will help 

our chemistry, but sometimes 
there’s cliques and those three 
are always together, so we want 
to break that up and make sure 
they understand, ‘You’re part of a 
team now, a bigger team.’ This is 
bigger than just the three Roman 
Catholic guys. We also have 
Shep Garner who’s from Roman 
Catholic as well, so I think he’s 
bridged everything very well to 
bring these guys in and create the 
chemistry and connectivity that 
we’re looking for to make this 
team even better.

TMD: How do you think 

(Garner) will respond to playing 
with some of those young guys 
again?

PC: There’s going to be a 

comfort level, and I think they’re 
going to be comfortable with 
him. They’re very mature beyond 
their years — all four of the guys 
— because Shep’s a junior who’s 
played so many minutes that you’d 
think he’s a senior. And these 
younger guys have been in a ton of 

big games, so they’re conducting 
themselves in a very mature 
manner, which is good and bodes 
well for our future. But right now, 
the connectivity of this team is 
going well, and they’re starting to 
really respect and listen to Shep 
a lot, so I think that’s gonna help 
them.”

TMD: How will it aid their 

transition to have someone like 
him, who they already have a 
relationship with, to serve as a 
mentor for them?

PC: I think that Shep can 

pass down to them some of the 
pitfalls, some of the challenges and 
adversity that he went through 
his freshman year and sophomore 
year. He can kind of give them a 
Cliffnotes version, a little bit of a 
guide to show them, ‘Steer clear of 
this, be careful of this, this is how 
coach likes this,’ so they’re a little 
bit further ahead.

TMD: How will it help them to 

see that someone who came from 
the same place as them has been 
able to perform at a high level on 
the college stage?

PC: I think it gives them great 

confidence that they can follow 

suit, that they can do it too, that 
they can come in and make an 
impact as a freshman as Shep 
did. And then they see the player 
development, they see how much 
they’ve gotten better or how much 
Shep has gotten better, and they’re 
gonna believe in the process just as 
Shep has done.

TMD: How strong do you think 

the leadership on the team will be 
despite an absence of seniors on 
the roster?

PC: (Former forward) Brandon 

Taylor did a wonderful job of 
really preparing these guys for 
their time to be leaders, and what 
I’ve done is I’ve put together 
a leadership council to help in 
that process. We have five guys 
that I meet with regularly that 
we talk about issues, talk about 
locker room, talk about practice, 
talk about academics, talk about 
social stuff, and it’s been really 
good. We’re gonna obviously vote 
for captains here real soon, but 
I think as a whole, there’s been 
three or four guys that have really 
stepped up to take the reins to 
help one another out to lead this 
group.

Michigan coach John Beilein will lead the Wolverines as they face Penn State in pursuit of their first conference win Wednesday at Crisler Center.

10-3 season delivers odd blend of emotions

I

t doesn’t mean the system 
is perfect, but this time 
it worked out perfectly. 

Clemson and 
Alabama 
will meet 
in college 
football’s 
national 
champion-
ship game 
next week, 
and after a 
long bowl 
season, 
there’s little 
doubt that is the just outcome.

Both Michigan and Penn 

State, the two fan bases with 
the loudest — if not most con-
vincing — gripes over being 
left out of the playoff, lost late 
in two of the most thrilling 
games this season. Ohio State 
and Washington, losers of the 
two semifinals, were little 
match for the Crimson Tide and 
Tigers, who will play in the title 
game for the second straight 
year. After all the animated 
arguments over which Big Ten 
teams were most deserving of a 
playoff shot, the short answer 
was: it didn’t really matter.

That’s not to say the com-

mittee didn’t get it right. Their 
job was to pick the four best 
teams, and, given the informa-
tion at the time, they probably 
did. What it really means is that 
fans can rest at ease when they 
watch this year’s 
title game, their rea-
sons to shout now 
muted.

Instead, the natu-

ral end-of-season 
feelings can take 
hold early. And at 
Michigan, the pre-
dominant feeling is 
disappointment.

Before the Wol-

verines lost to Iowa 
nearly two months 
ago, they sat at 9-0, with every 
indication that a playoff berth 
would be in their future. When 
they lost on a last-second field 
goal, it was fair to wonder 

whether that loss might hold an 
epic team back from its destiny. 
Those fears were magnified, 

and ulti-
mately real-
ized, when 
Michigan 
came up on 
the wrong 
end of a dou-
ble-overtime 
classic at 
Ohio State 
two weeks 
later.

And then 

came the 

Orange Bowl. The Wolverines 
started flat, finished flashy and 
ultimately came up short once 
more in a 33-32 loss to Florida 
State. In the end, they finished 

the season 10-3, their three 
losses determined by a total of 
just five points.

But for those inclined to look 

back and wonder, “What if?” 
the loss to the Seminoles came 
with an odd blend of regret and 
relief. On one hand, the season 
that once looked special ended 
with the same record as last 
year, an apparent underachieve-
ment given all the NFL talent 
on the roster. On the other, at 
least now fans can put some dis-
tance between themselves and 
the nagging sensation that their 
team would have won it all had 
they just made the playoff.

Clemson, which beat Florida 

State earlier this year, trounced 
the Buckeyes, 31-0. And Ala-
bama still looked like Alabama. 

The Wolverines may have been 
good enough to compete with 
those powerhouses, but they 
didn’t deliver 
a convincing 
enough perfor-
mance to exac-
erbate those 
earlier losses.

The process 

of healing will 
still be arduous, 
though. In a 
year Michigan 
played eight 
home games 
and won on the road at Michi-
gan State, the Wolverines didn’t 
improve in the win column. A 
team that started 10 seniors on 
defense and was among the best 
in the nation in nearly every 

category missed the playoff. 
Unless a better team comes 
along soon, those facts will 

sting in five years.

But for now, 

fans can take 
some solace 
in closing the 
door on the 
2016 season. 
The Wolverines 
found a defen-
sive coordinator 
who could keep 
the unit close 
to the nation’s 

best for the foreseeable future. 
They found a capable redshirt 
sophomore quarterback with 
two more years of eligibility 
and a penchant for bouncing 
back from struggles. More than 

anything, they found out that 
a 10-win season isn’t satisfying 
anymore.

It has been a long time since 

a 10-win season was a disap-
pointment in Ann Arbor. This 
season, as promising as it start-
ed, ends looking and feeling like 
that. And as odd as it may be 
for Michigan and its fans, that’s 
reason for relief.

Michigan’s fans are left in a tough position, as their team didn’t perform well enough to earn a berth in the College Football Playoff, but Alabama and Clemson seem to be the best teams in the nation.

It has been a 

long time since a 
10-win season was 
a disappointment.

And at Michigan, 
the predominant 

feeling is 

disappointment.

ICE HOCKEY
Marody makes return 
to the ice for Wolverines

Coming 
into 
the 
2016-17 

season, the Michigan hockey team 
expected 
sophomore 
forward 

Cooper Marody to be a main 
contributor on a team losing much 
of its scoring from the previous 
year.

But after having academic 

issues last season, Marody was 
deemed ineligible for the first 
semester of this year, which meant 
that he would be unable to play in 
the Wolverines’ first 16 games.

Marody 

finally returned 
to 
the 
ice 

Thursday 
in 

the Great Lakes 
Invitational. But 
while he had 
been practicing 
with the team 
all season, in 
his first game 
— 
against 

Michigan Tech 
in the semifinal of the tournament 
— the sophomore showed some 
signs of rust.

Marody 
wasn’t 
alone. 

Michigan’s 
entire 
offense 

was stymied by the Huskies, 
producing just 23 shots on goal 
with zero goals. Marody led the 
Wolverines with five shots on 
goal, but that effort wasn’t nearly 
good enough, as Michigan Tech 
won, 2-0.

“It’s hard to show up and play 

his first game in probably nine 
months and make an impact,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
after Thursday’s game. “He’s 
worked hard all semester in 
practice. I think he’ll help our 
team, but it wasn’t to be tonight. 
He had a lot of chances, a lot of 
guys had chances — what if — but 
it never happened.”

Friday against Michigan State, 

Marody and Michigan’s offense 
flipped the script. The Wolverines 
notched five goals in all, with 
Marody earning three assists.

One of the beneficiaries of 

Marody’s playmaking was senior 

forward Alex Kile, who was on 
the same line as Marody in both 
games. Kile scored two goals 
against the Spartans, both off 
assists from Marody. And though 
the GLI served as the first time 
the two have played together 
this season, their improvement 
from one game to the next was 
noticeable.

“The first game back, it’s 

going to be a lot different than 
just practicing,” Marody said. 
“It’s been a while since I played 
a game and really got up to that 
speed. And I think after a day of 
playing together, me and Alex 

have gained great 
chemistry. And I 
think as a team we 
just played better, 
which helped us 
play better.”

Added 
Kile: 

“I 
think 
time 

will tell with our 
chemistry. 
But 

we’re two players 
that want to play 
with each other, 

and any time you have that, I 
think chemistry will form right 
off the bat. So, I mean, we’ve still 
got 20-plus games left, and I think 
as the season goes on we’re just 
going to get better.”

Michigan can only hope that 

the two will be able to develop 
that 
relationship, 
and 
that 

Marody will continue to improve 
as the season goes on. Not only did 
Marody provide another scoring 
threat on offense, but he also 
provides experience on defense. 
The sophomore wasn’t on the 
ice for any of the six goals scored 
against 
the 
Wolverines 
this 

weekend, and though plus-minus 
can be a flawed statistic, Marody’s 
presence was surely felt.

And on a team looking for 

answers after the first half of 
its season, Michigan will hope 
to ride some momentum from 
Marody’s return. With a majority 
of the Big Ten season left to play, 
coupled with the Wolverines’ 
inconsistency thus far, they need a 
boost from somewhere.

Michigan finishes third at Great Lakes Invitational 

DETROIT — With the score 

knotted up at 4-4 at the end 
of regulation, the Michigan 
hockey team found itself in a 
five-minute 
overtime 
period 

in its first battle of the season 
against in-state rival Michigan 
State on Friday. It would take 
only one goal to determine 
the winner of the first of five 
meetings between the two foes 
this season.

That determining goal came 

from 
junior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone.

Assisted by junior forward 

Dexter Dancs, Calderone was 
able to clean up a loose puck and 
put it in the back of the net with 
2:02 remaining in the overtime 
period. With his tenth goal of 
the season, Calderone helped 
Michigan stun the Spartans, 
5-4.

The Wolverines (1-3-0 Big 

Ten, 8-9-1 overall) took home 
a third-place finish in the 52nd 
annual Great Lakes Invitational 
with their victory over Michign 
State (0-2-0, 4-11-1), after a 
2-0 loss to Michigan Tech on 
Thursday.

“This 
was 
a 
learning 

experience,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach 
Red 
Berenson. 

“Sometimes we leave here with 
a lot of confidence, and I think 
we’re going to leave (the Great 
Lakes Invitational) with some 
resolve and some awareness. We 
can look at this and say, ‘These 
were the areas we’ve got to fix.’ 
If you’ve got a car with a flat tire 
and you won’t admit it, you’re 
not going to get very far. We’re 
going to stop and fix the flat.

“It’s not as easy as that, but 

that’s what we’re going to take 
from this tournament.”

Four of the game’s nine 

goals were scored in the first 
period, three of which came 

from the Wolverines. The first 
came 3:57 into the game, when 
sophomore 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody attempted a shot that 
landed behind Michigan State 
goaltender 
John 
Lethemon. 

Calderone was there to clean it 
up, though, opening the scoring.

Michigan’s second goal came 

from freshman forward Will 
Lockwood, who managed to 
score a clean, unassisted wrister 
just two minutes later. The 
goal marked his seventh of the 
season and was his first since 
November 11th, when he tallied 
a goal against Boston University. 
It also put Lockwood at second 
for most goals scored, only 
behind Calderone, who has 10.

For a few minutes afterward, 

the Wolverines were able to 
keep the Spartans contained 
without allowing any quality 
chances. 
That 
was 
until 

Michigan 
State 
defenseman 

Carson Gatt corralled the puck 
on the Spartans’ end and sent it 
down the ice to forward Logan 
Lamdin. Lambdin shot the puck 
into the net from the left faceoff 
dot and whittled Michigan’s 
two-goal lead down to one.

Senior forward Alex Kile 

tacked on the final goal of the 
period on an assist from Marody 
and freshman forward James 
Sanchez. Kile pushed the puck 
through a crowd of players 
in front of Lethemon for the 

Wolverines’ third goal.

The second period started 

with 4-on-4 play, as senior 
defenseman Kevin Lohan and 
Michigan State’s Jerad Rosburg 
both earned a trip to the penalty 
box for roughing after the 
whistle at the end of the first. 
This play decreased to 3-on-
3 when junior forward Cutler 
Martin and Spartan forward 
Patrick Khodorenko were both 
called for tripping.

Despite the calls, though, 

both 
teams 
killed 
off 
the 

penalties without allowing any 
goals. 

Senior 
goaltender 
Zach 

Nagelvoort made critical saves 
throughout 
the 
period, 
one 

of which was when Spartan 
forward Connor Wood brought 
the puck into a dangerously 
close position in Michigan’s 
zone. Nagelvoort deterred the 
shot, and managed another 
quick save soon thereafter to 
maintain the Wolverines’ two-
goal wlead.

Kile was the only player 

on either team to find the net 
in the second period, with 
6:41 left on the clock. While 
standing near Michigan State’s 
net, junior defenseman Sam 
Piazza generated a shot, and 
Kile tipped the puck into the net 
while it was still in the air.

This gave Michigan a three-

goal lead heading into the third 

period, but it took Spartan 
forward Mason Appleton just 
seven seconds to decrease the 
lead to two. After corralling 
the puck off the initial faceoff, 
Appleton scored on a breakaway 
to push the score to 4-2.

At the 14:50 mark, Gatt left 

the Wolverines clinging to a 
one-goal lead after scoring from 
a wrister.

“There’s a sense of confidence 

when you’re up 4-1, but Michigan 
State is a team that loves playing 
against us and they’re obviously 
not going to give up, especially 
in an enviroment like this, you 
can never count them out,” Kile 
said. “It was a good start for us, 
getting to 4-1, but it was a really 
bad third period for us, letting 
them get three straight. Moving 
forward, that can’t happen.”

In an attempt to strengthen 

his team’s lead, Calderone took 
the puck down to Michigan 
State’s net and passed it to 
freshman forward Jake Slaker at 
the last moment in a desperate 
attempt to get the puck past 
Lethemon, but it was no good.

In the final seconds of the 

period, Michigan State forward 
JT Stenglein skated through a 
crowded Michigan defense in 
front of the net to finish off a 
loose puck and score the tying 
goal.

But Calderone took advantage 

of 
the 
overtime 
period 
to 

put the Wolverines on top in 
this matchup of in-state and 
conference rivals. 

“Even though they took it to 

overtime, it’s a good learning 
lesson for our team,” Marody 
said. “There’s going to be times 
in the future when we’re going 
to have leads going into the 
third period, and we learned 
our lesson that the other team 
is going to come hard and they 
might score a couple of goals, 
but we finished hard at the 
end of the game. It was a good 
lesson.”

After falling to Michigan Tech on Thursday, the Wolverines recovered to defeat Michigan State in overtime on Friday.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Junior forward Tony Calderone scored the game-winning goal to defeat the Spartans and lead Michigan to a third-place finish at the Great Lakes Invitational.

Thome shines in victory against the Badgers

While the Michigan women’s 

basketball team is known for 
its depth and ability to spread 
the ball around to a variety of 
contributors, 
one 
individual 

performance stood out for the 
Wolverines (2-0 Big Ten, 13-3 
overall) in their 73-56 road 
win over the Badgers (0-1, 5-9) 
to start the new year on a high 
note.

Sophomore forward Hallie 

Thome scored more than half 
of Michigan’s points — 37 to be 
exact. That feat lands Thome 
at No. 2 on the list of most 
points during a single game in 
Wolverine history, a fact she 
knew nothing about over the 
course of her dominant showing.

“I had no idea,” Thome said. 

“(Junior guard Maria Backman) 
tried to tell me at one of the 
timeouts, and I was like, ‘Maria, 
don’t tell me, I don’t want to 
know.’ I don’t like knowing the 
points, I just like playing the 
game and doing my own thing.”

Though Thome pushed the 

statistics to the back of her 
mind during game time, she was 
pleased to learn the final tally 
once the contest had come to a 
close. While Thome averages 
14.6 points per game so far this 
season, her accuracy took her 
to the next level Sunday, as she 
shot 13-for-15 from the floor.

“She hasn’t really had a 

breakout game in a while,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “So hopefully this really 
elevates her confidence, because 
she was sensational.”

At 6-foot-5 — the tallest of 

the Wolverines — Thome used 
her height and length to her 
advantage in controlling the 
paint and making layups look 
effortless. She found her way 
to the free-throw line often and 
made the most of it, going 11-for-
13 on the afternoon. Thome not 
only led the team in points, but 
achieved a double-double by 
tacking on 14 rebounds. 

“Being 
aggressive 
and 

wanting to go get them (made 
the difference),” Thome said. 
“It was a close game, but we just 

had the will to want to go and 
get it. I think that’s what our 
whole team had.”

Junior guard Jillian Dunston 

played a major role on the 
glass as well, contributing nine 
defensive boards and preventing 
Wisconsin from gaining second-
chance attempts.

“That was our number one 

goal today, to just rebound the 
basketball,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We knew we were going to be 
undersized against them, and 
Jillian Dunston did a great job.”

Freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick was another bright 
spot on the court for Michigan 
on Sunday, tallying 16 points and 
five rebounds of her own.

As 
a 
newcomer 
to 
the 

Wolverines, 
Gondrezick 
has 

quickly made a name for herself 
in 
the 
conference, 
earning 

recognition as the Big Ten 
Freshman of the Week twice 
already this season. She has also 
recently broken into the starting 

lineup, as this was just her 
second time on the court from 
the opening tip. She joined the 
starting five for the first time on 
Dec. 28 against Rutgers. 

Against 
the 
Badgers, 

Gondrezick’s three 3-pointers 
in the fourth quarter solidified 
Michigan’s win over Wisconsin, 
proving that she might stay in 
the starting lineup for good.

The 
Wolverines’ 
leading 

scorer, junior guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, became Michigan’s 
fifth-highest scorer in program 
history with her eight-point 
performance. Yet it wasn’t the 
level of play that can usually be 
expected from Flaherty, who 
averages 17.9 points.

Flaherty’s eight points make 

this her fourth straight game 
with fewer points than her 
season average, following her 
totals of eight against Vermont, 
17 against American and 13 
against Rutgers.

“As a player, you have a 

couple games like that, you start 
questioning everything you do,” 
Barnes Arico said. “You start 
pressing, 
you’re 
questioning 

when your shot is released, 
pretty much everything.

“But 
she’s 
a 
tremendous 

player. … She’s going to play 
herself out of this.”

While 
Flaherty 
has 
still 

managed 
to 
be 
productive, 

Michigan is expecting much 
more from its consensus All-Big 
Ten first-team player. She went 
0-for-7 on 3-pointers against the 
Badgers, which leaves plenty of 
room for improvement.

But while the Wolverines 

wait for Flaherty to regain 
the 
shooting 
stroke 
and 

confident approach that have 
characterized her career, they 
have capable players who can 
make up for the deficit. With her 
performance Sunday, Thome 
proved that she can take control 
and lead Michigan to victory on 
her own.

Michigan falls short against Hawkeyes in overtime, 86-83

IOWA CITY — The Michigan 

men’s basketball team hadn’t 
won a game in Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena since 2011. Even then, the 
Wolverines needed five extra 
minutes to get the job done.

On the first day of 2017, 

Michigan (0-1 Big Ten, 10-4 
overall) found out overtime would 
not be in the formula to break 
that streak, as the Wolverines 
dropped their Big Ten opener to 
Iowa, 86-83.

Hawkeye guard Peter Jok, who 

entered Sunday’s contest leading 
the conference averaging 21.9 
points per game, hit a three with 
the game knotted at 81 and 1:18 to 
go that ultimately gave Iowa (1-1, 
9-6) the breathing room it needed 
to pull out the win.

The Wolverines had a couple 

of opportunities to catch up to 
the Hawkeyes to force another 
overtime period or even leave 
with the win. Down three, senior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. stole an 
inbound pass and took it all the 
way to the rim to trim the deficit 
to one.

After a pair of Jok free throws 

brought Iowa’s lead back up 
to three with 19.7 seconds left, 
redshirt sophomore forward DJ 
Wilson missed a three with seven 
seconds to go. Wilson’s attempt 
was rebounded by senior guard 
Zak Irvin, who, after a couple 
passes, had the ball in his hands 
again. But he failed to get a shot 
off from behind the arc with 
Hawkeye defenders swarming 
him as the final seconds ticked 
away.

“It wasn’t really for me, it was 

more for (Walton) and (redshirt 
junior guard Duncan Robinson) 
rolling up,” Wilson said of his 
final shot. “I got the skip pass and 
I think I got a look and just shot 
it wrong.”

The Wolverines had a chance 

to prevent the game from going 
into overtime in the first place, 
when Michigan had the ball with 
the game tied at 74 and 15 seconds 
remaining. Walton let the clock 
wind down before driving toward 
the hoop and absorbing contact 
in the process. No foul was called 
and the ball went out of bounds, 
inevitably sending the game into 
overtime.

“I hated that,” said Michigan 

coach John Beilein. “We ran 
something that I (thought) would 
get (sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner) open on a ball screen or 
to do something and we didn’t get 
rid of it quick enough.

“But that was my fault. We 

should have run something, we 

had just put it in the other day 
and I thought it would work. We 
should have run something we 
have run more.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
inability 

to put the game away against 
Iowa cost them an important 
conference road victory and a 
chance to find momentum early 
in the Big Ten season.

But there are some silver 

linings Michigan can leave Iowa 
City with.

Both Wilson and Wagner each 

had games to remember in their 
first career Big Ten starts.

Even in the opening minutes 

of Sunday’s matchup, it was clear 
Wilson was going to have a career 
day. With over four minutes 

left in the first half, the forward 
surpassed 
his 

previous career 
high of 16 points 
on his way to 
finishing 
with 

a double-double 
of 28 points and 
14 rebounds.

Wagner 

also 
had 
his 

own 
moments 

navigating the 
Hawkeyes’ 
defense in the 
post. He finished with 12 points 
on 6-for-10 shooting.

Walton and Irvin, on the other 

hand, had a difficult return from 
their holiday break. The pair shot 

1-for-11 in the opening half but 

found some rhythm 
in 
the 
final 
25 

minutes, finishing 
with a combined 
25 
points, 
nine 

rebounds and nine 
assists.

“Those guys are 

expected to do a lot 
of things,” Beilein 
said. 
“They’re 

guarding their two 
best players, then 
they have to turn 

around and score on offense. 
That’s the mindset a senior has 
got to have and I like the way they 
rebounded out of that.”

Robinson was also essential 

in Michigan’s effort down the 
stretch, scoring 15 points on 
6-for-12 shooting.

But even that wasn’t enough, 

as the Wolverines will once again 
leave Iowa City without a win, 
heartbroken they couldn’t finish 
in crunch time. Even when they 
had multiple opportunities to 
clinch a victory, Michigan fell 
short in the critical moments.

“The balls didn’t bounce our 

way sometimes, but that’s Big Ten 
play and we have to learn from 
it,” Beilein said. “Our guys are 
really disappointed, but we have 
17 more games in this league. 
Hopefully there are a lot of things 
we will learn and take forward to 
Penn State on Wednesday.”

Redshirt sophomore DJ Wilson scored a career-high 28 points and added 14 rebounds to notch a double-double in the Wolverines’ overtime loss.

Evans, freshmen disappointed 
to send seniors out with a loss

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — A 

half-hour after the Michigan 
football team’s season ended in 
a 33-32 loss, Chris Evans walked 
around the Wolverines’ locker 
room with an Orange Bowl 
program and a marker.

Looking like a young sports 

fan getting the chance to meet 
his heroes, the freshman running 
back went from locker to locker, 
asking for signatures on the 
program’s front cover.

Evans walked up to quarterback 

Shane Morris, a redshirt junior 
who is rumored to be playing 
elsewhere next year as a graduate 
transfer. He made his way to 
wide receiver Amara Darboh, 
a fifth-year senior who had just 
caught a 2-point conversion to 
give Michigan a three-point lead 
before Florida State ultimately 
snatched it away. And finally, 
Evans found the leader of his 
position group, senior running 
back De’Veon Smith, waiting for 
him in the middle of the room, 
happy to inscribe his name on the 
blue-and-white cover.

Those were just three of many 

players who were facing the end of 
their careers as Wolverines after 
the loss, and Evans wanted to 
make sure he remembered them 
all.

“I came into this game saying, 

‘I’m just gonna play for the seniors,’ 
so I feel like we let them down,” he 
said. “So I just wanted to get that. 
… (They were) really impactful 
on me. I came in to really nobody 
being there for me, to the seniors 
like De’Veon coming to me (all 
the time). So (if) I just keep riding 
with them, good things happen.”

Evans himself didn’t let anyone 

down with his play — his 49 yards 
on the ground and 6.1 yards per 
play both were team highs, and his 
30-yard touchdown in the fourth 
quarter nearly stood as the game-
winning score with under two 
minutes to play. (“I thought we 
had it in the bag,” he said.)

But the Seminoles answered 

with a go-ahead touchdown, 
and though another freshman — 
safety/linebacker Josh Metellus 
— contributed to Michigan by 
returning a blocked extra point 
for two points, the Wolverines 
couldn’t retake the lead.

Thinking 
about 
the 

heartbreaking ending for Smith 

and the rest of the seniors, Evans 
couldn’t help but feel disappointed.

“It was all for the seniors,” he 

said. “All the hard work that we 
put in — especially for the young 
guys. The coaches were saying, 
‘Do it for the seniors, this game is 
for them.’”

It was especially personal for 

the running backs, who blossomed 
under senior leadership in 2016. 
Evans praised Smith’s openness, 
saying that he felt like he could 
go to him for anything, from “girl 
problems” to football questions.

Fellow freshman running back 

Kareem Walker — who redshirted 
and had to take some time away 
from football to catch up on his 
academics earlier this season — 
echoed the importance of having a 
role model to look up to during his 
tumultuous first year on campus.

“I love it,” he said. “It’s a very 

humbling experience. You’ve got 
guys like (Smith) who’ve really 
done a lot. … I could feel like 
I’m doing bad, and he’ll tell me, 
‘No, you’re not doing bad at all.’ 
Our relationship really got a lot 
stronger as the year went on, and 
things starting going well for me.”

Evans and Walker are part of 

what could be the first of many 
talented recruiting classes to 
come to Ann Arbor in the coming 
years, and the class has already 
shown plenty of promise. But 
when the Wolverines resume 
practice in the spring, Smith 
and the rest of this year’s senior 
leaders won’t be around to guide 
them anymore.

“I feel like next year I’ve gotta 

come back and be able to be a whole 
different player,” Evans said. “To 
fill the role of De’Veon, it’s gonna 
be hard. He’s so experienced in all 
the little things, and it’s just gonna 
be hard filling that hole.”

In the meantime, though, 

Evans will have his Orange 
Bowl program, a collection of 
all the names that helped carve 
the path for his class to follow. 
And with big shoes to fill and a 
season-ending loss hanging over 
the team’s heads, Evans says 
they already feel like it’s time to 
get back to work.

“We should 

have run 

something we 
have run more.”

Jake Butt suffers tragic injury in 
final game of his Michigan career 

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — 

Wednesday night, Jake Butt stood 
in front of a Brazilian steakhouse 
in Miami Beach and defended the 
decisions of two of his peers to sit 
out their bowl games for fear of 
injury. He was visibly ill and had 
given bland answers to most of 
the questions, but when the topic 
came up, he defended Christian 
McCaffrey 
and 
Leonard 

Fournette with gusto.

“Here we are, we’re living 

off rent checks, a guy sees an 
opportunity for a lifelong dream 
in the NFL, they make a business 
decision. I can’t judge anybody,” 
he said. “I don’t know what all 
went into that decision, and I’m 
not going to pretend to know. So 
I’m not going to judge or act on 
that. I support those guys, and 
best of luck to them.”

How cruel is fate? Some 50-odd 

hours later, Butt was writhing in 
pain on the 6-yard line at Hard 
Rock Stadium. The very risk 
McCaffrey and Fournette sought 
to avoid by sitting out their 
respective bowl games had struck 
Butt. Fighting for extra yards 
after he had already picked up a 
first down, Butt absorbed a hit on 
his right knee. His plant leg bent 
sideways.

Later, Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh revealed it was either 
an MCL or an ACL injury, though 
he did not know the severity. The 
injury could prove devastating.

“Irony, I guess,” said fifth-

year senior Ryan Glasgow. “Some 
twisted joke.”

Butt eventually walked off the 

field, giving the crowd a thumbs-
up on his way to the tunnel, but it 
was clear he wasn’t right. He did 
not return.

“Cruel fate is probably a good 

way to put it,” Glasgow said. “I 
mean, we are to the gods as flies 
are to wanton boys.”

There’s plenty of room to 

debate whether players ought to 
sit out bowl games, whether they 
owe it more to the school to play 
or to themselves to be safe, but 

this much is hardly up for debate: 
What happened to Jake Butt on 
Friday is tragic. It didn’t take 
Glasgow’s “King Lear” reference 
to see that.

Here was a player unwilling 

to judge his peers for their 
own decisions but still himself 
committed 
to 
playing. 
He 

somehow did right by both sides 
of the argument, and in the end, 
he paid the price.

We won’t know just how steep 

a price until later on, perhaps after 
an MRI, but Glasgow said, from 
what he’s heard, it “doesn’t look 
too good.” ESPN’s Darren Rovell 
tweeted Friday that Butt took out 
a $4 million disability insurance 
policy and a $2 million loss of value 
policy that he can start collecting 
if he falls beyond the second round 
of the NFL Draft.

That, at least, is a small 

consolation. But that was far from 
the minds of Butt’s teammates in 
the locker room.

“It’s horrible,” said senior 

cornerback 
Jourdan 
Lewis. 

“Especially when you have the 
desire to go out and play with 
your teammates, and when you 
have future endeavors that you’re 
thinking about that a lot of people 
wouldn’t understand if you didn’t 
play. It’s a horrible misfortune of 
events that it happened to Jake, 

and I’m just praying that he has a 
big bounce back, and I know the 
guy has great things in store for 
him.”

Added 
fifth-year 
senior 

defensive end Chris Wormley: 
“When you’ve put in as much 
work as he has, came back from 
an ACL injury a couple years ago, 
team captain, put his heart and 
soul into this team each and every 
day, sometimes you ask ‘Why?’ 
Sometimes you don’t understand 
why things happen to a good 
person like Jake.”

It seems beside the point 

that Michigan sorely missed 
its captain and Mackey Award 
winner in its 33-32 loss in the 
Orange Bowl, but it’s a safe 
bet that wasn’t far from Butt’s 
mind as the calendar turned to 
Saturday. “Never once crossed 
my mind to sit this game out,” he 
tweeted afterward.

Maybe, you could argue, it 

should have. Or maybe fate is fate, 
and, as Butt also tweeted, “God 
has a plan.” Maybe the guy just 
got sinisterly unlucky.

Wherever he was in the wee 

hours of Saturday morning, Butt 
was still taking the high road. 
But perhaps some part of him 
was more like his teammates — 
shocked, devastated and left to 
wonder, “Why?”
