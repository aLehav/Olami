Administrators
implement new
prerequsites,
smaller class sizes
By ASHWINI NATARAJAN
Daily Stuff Reporter
Students planning to major in
communications will be initiated
into the department's new rede-
signed curriculum, which has a
focus on new modes of thinking
smaller class sizes and a less oner-
ous application process.
In response to changes in the
field, a result of the vast integration
of communication technology into
everyday life, the University's Com-
munication Studies Department has
renovated its curriculum.
The department last updated its
curriculum in 1995. Since then, it
has has tripled in size and the scope
offacultyresearch and teachinghas
broadened to accompany increas-
ingly globalized media.

Department chair Susan Doug-
las said the new curriculum was
designed to be more standardized.
"We felt that the organization of
our curriculum wasn't as coherent
as it should it be," Douglas said.
The redesign is, in part, focused
on giving concentrators a more
global understanding ofthe media.
"We want to expand students
global horizons and not just focus
on America," Douglas said.
Associate Communications Prof.
Amanda Lotz said an overhaul was
necessary because the field of media
has increased in relevancy.
"(The old curriculum)wasbefore
a lot of the media that was central
to our lives had been created," Lotz
said. "The new curriculum updates
our offerings and incorporates
aspects into our regular curriculum
which were often special topics that
were irregularly offered."
Courses with more research-
based curricula involving critical,
analytical and theoretical skills will
be introduced at the 200 and 300
levels -classeslike Communications

Students in Michigan's frozen

of the frigid weather and tak-

Winter Carnival.
The Houghton school officially
kicked off the party on Wednes-

snow and ice sculptures that are
the centerpiece of the carnival.
An all-night push to finish
the sculptures began at 4 p.m.

Texas prison
escapee caught

A Texas prison escapee on the

captured by authorities in Mex-

U.S. to finish serving his sentence
on charges of attempted capital
murder of a police officer, state
Department of Criminal Justice
officials said Wednesday.
Juan Salaz was apprehended
last week. The 37-year-old Ameri-
can citizen had been sought for
years by authorities on both sides
of the border.
Salaz escaped the night of
March 22, 1997, from the Garza

Ireland readies
deal to ease costs of

bank bailout
The Irish government put law-
makers on standby to pass emer-
gency legislation Wednesday as
a deal neared with the European
Central Bank to reform the repay-
ment terms of Ireland's colossal
bank-bailout bill, a move designed
to reduce Ireland's deficits and
ease its return to normal borrow-
ing.
Aides to Finance Minister
Michael Noonan said he hoped
to unveil terms of the agreement
with eurozone banking chiefs in
Ireland's parliament Wednesday
night. But government officials
later said negotiations with ECB
partners might continue over-
night and delay the bill's passage
to Thursday.
The bill would authorize the
immediate liquidation of one of
Ireland's two government-owned
"bad banks," the Irish Bank Reso-
lution Corp. or IBRC, which for
the past two years has managed
the toxic property-based loans
of two collapsed banks, Anglo
Irish and Irish Nationwide. The
IBRC chairman, Alan Dukes, said
its board has already been dis-
solved as of Wednesday night and
responsibility handed over to a
consulting firm that will manage
the liquidation.

Acapulco rape case hurts
tourism in peak season

Gang members
raped women in
beachfront home
ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)
- The tourism world turned
its eyes on Mexico after six
Spanish women were raped by
masked gunmen during a vaca-
tion in the long-troubled Pacific
coast resort of Acapulco.
While there has been talk
of reviving the golden era of
the '40s and '54s, international
tourists have long steered away
from Acapulco, even before the
drug violence of recent years, as
the city fell into disrepair and
glitzier Cancun and Los Cabos
gained favor.
The question now is wheth-
er the attack will affect other
resorts as Mexico prepares
for its annual spring break
onslaught and peak season.
The hours-long assault was
carried out by a gang of masked
gunmen who burst into the
beachfront home before dawn
on Monday and tied up the
six men inside, then raped the
women. A seventh Mexican
woman was unharmed.
"We are really sorry about
what happened with the Span-
ish tourists because ... it is
something that affects Mexi-
co's image," said Juan Carlos
Gonzalez, tourism secretary of
Quintana Roo, the Caribbean
coast state where Cancun is
located and which hosted about
17 million tourists last year.
But, he added, "we are defi-
nitely not as contaminated
with the crime issue as other
states in Mexico."
Acapulco barely registers on

U.S. tourists' radar anymore,
said Kathy Gerhardt, a spokes-
woman for Travel Leaders,
a network of independently
owned and operated travel
agencies in the U.S.
"Those individuals trying
to lump Acapulco into the list
of top Mexico destinations for
U.S. travelers are simply misin-
formed," she said.
In a recent survey of over
1,000 travel agency owners,
managers and agents, "not a
single individual chose Aca-
pulco as a top international
destination they are booking
fortheir clients," Gerhardtsaid.
"We do not see any spillover
effect," she added, for areas like
Cancun, which Travel Leaders
lists as the No. 2 foreign desti-
nation for U.S. travelers, after
Caribbean island cruises.
From a 2009 shootout that
killed 18 near Acapulco's fabled
Flamingo Hotel to this week's
attack, the resort once celebrat-
ed in Frank Sinatra songs and
Elvis Presley movies has been
the scene of body dumpings,
beheadings and taxi-driver
killings as gangs vie for drug
transport routes once con-
trolled by the now-decimated
Beltran Leyva cartel.
Oceania and Regent Seven
Seas Cruises - some of the
last lines making port calls in
Acapulco - canceled those in
December, before the latest
attack.
An estimated 50,000 Span-
iards travel to Mexico each
year, but mostly to the Carib-
bean coast, not Acapulco.
Mexicans and Spaniards liv-
ing in Mexico like the victims,
however, flock to Acapulco
during Easter week and other

long holiday weekends, such as
Monday, when the country cel-
ebrated its Constitution Day.
Local tourists believe they
can distinguish unsafe areas of
the city, and even foreign travel
warnings say it's safe for those
who don't wander far from the
beach.
"For us, this is an incredibly
safe zone," said Rafael Gallego
Nadal, president of the Span-
ish Confederation of Travel
Agencies. "This was a terrible
attack, but it's not the first time
that something bad has hap-
pened in that part of Mexico."
He said there has been no
talk of travel agencies reducing
package tour prices.
Some press reports Wednes-
day suggested a drug purchase
could have played a role in
Monday's rapes, but Marcos
Juarez, the chief investigator
for Guerrero state prosecutors,
said there was no evidence of
that.
Still, the attack exposed a
dangerous security situation
in areas that had been consid-
ered safe, such as the laid-back
stretch of beach dotted with
restaurants, small hotels and
homes southeast of the city's
center, where the Spaniards
had rented a villa.
The five attackers held the
group at gunpoint, tying up the
six men with phone cords and
bathing suit straps, then raping
the six women over a three-
hour period, authorities said.
The manager of a hotel near
the house said he heard shout-
ing just after midnight Mon-
day, but did nothing because he
felt it would be too dangerous.
The man did not want to give
his name for safety reasons.

In the driver's seat
Issuing IDs is just the beginning of immigration reform
n Friday, the Michigan Secretary of State's office announced
they would issue driver's licenses to undocumented immi-
grants who've been approved to work and study in the state.
Immigrants who qualify for the federal Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals Program, a policy announced by President Barack Obama
in June, can now receive temporary Michigan licenses, reversing the
state's previous approach under Secretary Ruth Johnson. While the
state aligning with the DACA program is a good first step, more sub-
stantial immigration reform is needed to keep immigrants working
in Michigan.

Under DACA, illegal immigrants who
arrived in the United States'before they were
16, are under age 31, have lived here for five
years, are enrolled or graduated from high
school and don't pose a risk are eligible for
a renewable 2-year deportation deferral.
According to a recent MLive article, John-
son previously denied licenses to DACA-
approved immigrants, stating issues with
technical language in Michigan's law, which
forbids issuing licenses to those without
proof of legal presence. But after last month's
decision from the U. S. Citizenship and Immi-
gration Services, which affirmed that DACA
receivers were indeed legal citizens, John-
son changed her tone. On Feb. 1, the Michi-
gan SOS office announced they'd allow these
immigrants to own Michigan driver's licens-
es. Comprehensive reform still lies ahead.
In January, Gov. Rick Snyder reflected
on the immigration debate currently taking
place on the national level, urging for more
extensive change in immigration policy: "It's
critical that we implement an effective sys-
tem for legal immigration," he said in a Jan. 30
statement. Snyder is a proponent of increas-
ing work visas to highly skilled immigrants
- as well as other reforms - but no legisla-
tive action has been taken to make this a real-
ity. If Michigan wishes to be on the forefront
of immigration reform, the state legislature
must take action to open up opportunities
to all immigrants - not just those skilled in
science, technology, engineering and math

fields. The governor has verbalized his sup-
port for Obama's four-part immigration plan,
yet there are still families that are worlds
apart while Congress argues on full amnesty
for immigrants.
Here at the University, Mary Sue Coleman
has come out in support for changing the
school's immigration policy but has made no
tangible commitments to specific issues like
tuition equality. Currently, undocumented
students who live in Michigan but lack nec-
essary paperwork don't qualify for in-state
tuition - even if they've lived in the state
throughout high school. Federal and state
financial aid isn't offered to these students
either, making an affordable education at
the University out of reach for many. Cole-
man applauded the national discussion about
immigration reform but refrained from chal-
lenging the current tuition policies, instead
stating that there needed to be laws that allow
tuition equality in order for the University to
act. While the Illegal Immigration Reform
and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996
prohibits immigrants from benefits like finan-
cial aid, public universities are constitutional-
ly autonomous, meaningthe University makes
its own rules regarding residency require-
ments for students. While administrative
task forces have been made with the Coali-
tion for Tuition Equality, progress has been
slow. Going forward, the University must
take a stronger stance on immigration rights,
encouraging effective and moral policies.

Duke University has been
making the news - but not
for the right reasons. A fra-
ternity's decision
to hold an Asian-
themed party
sparked outrage
across the cam-
pus. The party
incorporated
many different
Asian stereo-
types, including HARSHA
conical hats and NAHATA
geisha outfits.
The party
inspired protests by the university's
Asian Students Association - sen-
timents that have been supported
campus-wide. A few months earlier,
a Pennsylvania State University fra-
ternity's decision to throw a Mexi-
can-themed party also elicited anger
from many.
There's a lot that has been said
about these incident, especially in
our campus community. If Facebook
is any indication, the consensus is
that what happened at Duke is out-
rageous and unacceptable. And it is.
It's disrespectful and a huge over-
simplification and overgeneraliza-
tion of an entire community.
What's at the root of this and
other bias incidents we hear about
- whether here or at schools around
the country - are stereotypes. gen-
eralizations about how we see each
other and in turn how we expect
each other to act. ,
So, let's get to the bottom of this.
Let's talk about stereotypes.
They do exist. They always have
and always will.
"Asians are extremely smart and
competitive, have funny accents and
drive slowly."
"African Americans are lazy or
criminals."
"Hispanics are here illegally.
They're all border jumpers. Or they
facilitate the drug trade."
"Arabs and Muslims are terror-
ists."

And these are just the big ones.
Then there are all the other assump-
tions we make about personality and
appearance. Are they wearing bright
colors? They must be preppy. Dark
colors? Goth. Are they quiet? Social-
ly awkward. Are they smart?.Nerds.
Are they athletic? Arrogant.
I hope that those preceding para-
graphs were as difficult for you to
read as they were for me to write.
It's painful to acknowledge many of
these stereotypes because doing so
reminds us of just how superficial
they are. And yet, they exist.
We can't ignore stereotypes. We
can't discount them or hope for
them to magically disappear. They
won't. And if we keep tryingto cover
them up under a farce of political
correctness, they'll only continue
to subconsciously influence how we
see people. Which, if anything, is in
some ways just as bad as using them
in a disrespectful manner.
But we also can't be limited by
stereotypes. We can't let them influ-
ence what we strive for, or how we
see ourselves. And we absolutely
cannot use them to target or margin-
alize a group. Simply put, we can't
use them as a tool to hurt those who
are different.
And so it's necessary to under-
stand the purpose that stereotypes
serve, but then to take them with
a grain of salt. Stereotypes are an
extension of the heuristic devices
our brain uses to quickly process
the vast amount of information it
takes in. We categorize objects and
ideas all the time - in terms of color,
shape, size and purpose. In terms of
how much we like somethingor how
happy it makes us. Heck, we even
categorize categories.
But we have to. It's how our brain
forms connections. It's how we
remember information and inter-
nalize it. Stereotypes are simply an
extension of this need to find order
in a world with so much diverse
information. They're a way to orga-
nize the patterns we see. The only

difference is that with stereotypes
we're categorizing people, not just
objects or ideas.
And that's what we often forget
- that when we use stereotypes as
a way of categorizing, it's people
we're categorizing. Humans - with
feelings, dreams and insecurities.
We forget that the simplest way to
understand someone is just to talk to
them. We forget that no matter how
different our identities might be, we
all feel in the same way.
The problem is we're
categorizing people,
not just objects
or ideas.
Stereotypes lead us to oversim-
plify; and when we do, the only per-
sonthatloses outis us.Yes, incidents
like what happened at Duke are
hurtful to the targeted group, but
the targeted group knows its iden-
tity and has the strength to assert it.
Those perpetuating the generaliza-
tions of the stereotype are the ones
truly missing out.
They miss out on understanding
the beauty of a Zulture and a people.
They miss out on embracing a group
that may be potential friends. They
miss out on experiencing a new way
of life and think. Many of us prefer to
live in a simplified black-and-white
version of the world. And if that's the
choice you make, then so beit. But in
doing so, you close out a world of pos-
sibilities, a world of opportunities,
a world of learning about different
places and people and ways of life.
There's way more to an indi-
vidual than the stereotypes associ-
ated with the identities they hold.
It's unfair to them and to our-
selves to limit them to just that.

Asking the right questions

I'min lecture and suddenly, my heart starts
racing. Heart attack! Panic attack! Sponta-
neous human combustion! Is it because I'm
anemic? The possibilities I come up with for
what's happening to me seem endless. My
head fogs over as I slump into what might
possibly be the most resigned posture you've
ever seen.
Let's backtrack.
I've been here before: Someone walks into
class, sits somewhere by me and a bit of them
proceeds to go up my nose. I don't want to
come across as hoity-toity, and I'm aware
that air theoretically belongs to everyone, but
please, for the love of baby Jesus, don't wear
your perfume or cologne to class.
Let me try and talk you out of it. First of
all, if you're a person who is fond of a couple
morning sprays of a chemical fragrance, you
might want to check out the term "endocrine
disruptor." This is a broad category of chemi-
cals that includes things like phthalates,
bisphenol A, lead, pesticides, detergents and
other olfactory-inducing additives. But if you
intend on keeping your reproductive organs
intact, you might want to know that using
Axe on yourself might end up sculpting more

than just your aroma. Endocrine disruptors
are little buggers in perfume, cologne and
other things that mess with how hormones
work, and could lead to breast cancer, pros-
tate cancer, allergies, asthma and other con-
ditions and complications. Oprah has talked
about them, Nick Kristof has written about
them and while there're definitely some sci-
ence aspects I don't understand about them, I
do know how perfume and cologne physically
make me feel.
There needs tobe a bigger discussion about
what these chemicals do to our bodies. We
shouldn't be used as guinea pigs like the gen-
eration before us with smoking and figure out
years down the line that oh, hey, in retrospect,
that was a pretty harmful idea and we had no
clue what was going on. I realize that we can't
put seat belts and child safety locks on every-
thing we come in contact with, and I'm not
arguing for as big of a shaming campaign as the
one against smoking. ButI do think we need to
talk about the obnoxious and probably noxious
fragrances we subject ourselves to. We might
end up having fewer headaches all around.

When I mention to people that I
am Pakistani, I'm often asked, "Oh,
do you speak Arabic?" Other times
I'm told "Oh yeah, soccer must be
huge there." But I don't speak Arabic
- I speak English and Urdu. I won't
lie though, I love football, or soc-
cer, depending on where you are in
the world, but it's not actually huge
in Pakistan. Cricket is what's huge
there. The fact that I've stayed up
until 3 a.m. to watch Pakistan play
South Africa in a cricket match, that
will likely last 5 days and might end
in a draw, serves as a testament to
how important cricket is in Pakistan.
But that it's assumed that I speak
Arabic and watch soccer is a result of
grouping Pakistan with Arab Mus-
lim states and considering Pakistan
a part of the Middle East - not just
geographically but culturally, too.
I don't mean for this to be a long
rant about America. In fact, I appre-
ciate such questions - it's honest
curiosity. However, the generalized
grouping of people can be danger-
ous. Linguistically, historically, cul-
turally and politically, Pakistan has
nothingin commonwithArab states.
Brown skin and Muslim doesn't
equal Arab, just as white skin and
Christian doesn't equal American.
Making generalizations about
other countries isn't limited to stu-

dents. I've seen it in the spheres of
journalism, academia and even in
classes here. Many articles published
in renowned political magazines and
journals refer to the Muslim world
as if it were one monolithic bloc.
At times, the observations made
by these academics and journalists
about the wider Muslim world may
be accurate, but it does a disservice
to their audience who look to them as
a resource on these differentregions.
It can be hard to understand that
these groupings made by academics
and journalists aren't holistic. There
are stark differences between most
Muslim majority countries. While
there may be some similarities in
values and political systems in mid-
dle-eastern countries or "the West,"
it's even more important to under-
stand how each member of these
groups is unique.
Go to Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran,
Indonesia and Pakistan and you'll
notice how different these coun-
tries are. The people don't speak
the same language, they don't have
the same culture and the political
scenes are completely different. In
this one big Muslim bloc that people
create, there are some countries bit-
terly opposed to eachother. The only
thing that is similar is the majority
religion, Islam, but there are differ-

ent sects that divide even there.
In order to talk about issues
facing us today, we must try to
understand the intricacies of each
separate state. A principle criti-
cism of the U.S. operation in Iraq
was that the Bush administration
had notdone their homework on
the nation. They didn't consider
the socio-political climate of the
country, and, as a result, political
rifts were triggered after the inva-
sion. Once former Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's regime was
overthrown, absolute political and
administrative chaos ensued. Such
mistakes are bound to repeat if we
remain aloof to the particulars of
different countries and societies
that exist.
I've seen my country being tossed
around in different broadly defined
religious or geographical categories
- categories that it doesn't belong in.
Ourunique SouthAsianheritage and
cultureisn'tgivenitsduerecognition.
And it's not just Pakistan - many
regions are simplified to the point
of nonrecognition. Going forward,
we must educate ourselves about
the world. Or, at least understand
what distinguishes Pakistan from
Saudi Arabia. That would be a start.

bring together different methods
of approaches," Lotz said
In addition, newly devised 400-
level classes will be limited to 18-

classes about the history and evo-
lution of the media industries as
well as media globalization will be
added.
A new prerequisite course is the

NOMINATION

Laurel Ruza, the chair of
youMICH, said she often
works with Osborn through
the Student Organization
Funding Commission, where
she serves as secretary. She
said the decision to extend
the nomination to Osborn
was made with his prior CSG
experience in mind.
"I think that we all just saw
Chris's leadership ability in
his role currently and his past
roles," Ruza said. "We also
saw how Chris really cares
about CSG, and he cares about
the institution and he would
like to improve the institu-
tion."
CSG President Manish
Parikh also spoke well of
Osborn.
"He is a good treasurer, a

address the evolving role of mass
and emerging media in society.
"We are very excited about this
class because we don't think that
there is anythinglikeitinthecoun-
try," Douglas said.
Assistant Communications Prof.
Meghan Ankerson said the rapidly
evolving media culture should con-
stitute a larger part of the curricu-
lum in order for it to have real-life
applications.
"We were looking at ... how we
could make this curriculum best
for 21st century students who are
interested in a range of careers,"
Ankerson said. "We wanted to be
able to provide the critical think-
ing skills and the background that
would help (students) succeed in
today's culture."
JoAnn Peraino, the LSA cur-
riculum and enrollment manager,
noted that the most important
change to the curriculum is in the
admissions process. Instead of sub-

mitting an application and appli-
cation essay, applicants will be
admitted solely bytheir GPA.
Peraino said this. method of
admission will speed up the appli-
cation process.
LSA sophomore Emily .Lisner
- who is currently enrolled in
the final prerequisites required to
declare as a communication stud-
ies major - said she's indifferent
because she'll be declaring at the
end of this semester.
"All of my prerequisites are
almost fulfilled, so for me, as far as
Iknow, it doesn't affect me."
LSA sophomore Jamie Koop-
ersmith said she became aware of
the curriculum change when she
declared her major at the begin-
ningofthe schoolyear.
"I don't think it's positive or
negative, I think its good to get a
freshstart,"Koopersmithsaid. "It's
probably a good thing that they're
taking a look and modifying the
curriculum to better suitstudents."

ingredients come made-to-
order in perfectly plated crepes
that you won't find anywhere
else," Jenkins said. "We've
even been told that our crepes
are as good as or better than
ones you can get on the streets
of Paris."
They also plan on serving
a variety of wines, teas, sodas
and coffee.
"We also have a full bar and
specialty drink menu," Jenkins
said. "We're exploring vegan
wines and always include
Michigan products."
Just down the street, anoth-
er European breakfast res-
taurant opened recently. The
Wafel Shop only seats 16 peo-
ple, but aims to transport its
customers from Ann Arbor to
Belgium.

Wafel Shop Co-owner Noah
Goldsmith said fell in love
with Belgian-style waffles
after a study abroad trip to
Europe.
The restaurant specializes
in two types of "Wafels" -
Liege and Brussels - which
can be ordered with toppings
ranging from strawberries and
chocolate sauce to bacon and
maple syrup.
Though. there are other
breakfast restaurants near The
Wafel Shop, Goldsmith said
he's not concerned about the
competition.
"I believe we all offer some-
thing different," Goldsmith
said. "A lot of people think
that in order for one business
to succeed, another has to fail.
I don't think that. I think that
it doesn't have to be a failure
and that two businesses can
complement each other in their
works."


good friend and a great lead-
er and a very kind-hearted
human being," Parikh said.
"(Osborn) has served this
organization very well. He'd
be a great leader in any capac-
ity and in any position in this
organization."
When initially asked if
Osborn had been nominated
'by youMICH, Ruza denied that
the party had made any deci-
sion regarding a presidential
candidate, despite Osborn's
claim that he had been offered
the nomination.
"We have not embarked on
that process yet," Ruza said at
the time. "To our knowledge,
we have not nominated anybody
for that position yet. We have a
certain set of bylaws as a stu-
dent organization that we have
to follow in order to nominate a
candidate and to run that candi-
date."
Ruza continued to say Osborn

was "briefly" at youMICH's
meeting on Monday and that
no other potential candidates
attended, but added that you-
MICH was still looking at others.
After speaking with Osborn,
Ruza clarified her remarks,
blaming a misunderstanding of
the term "nomination."
"I think there was a miscom-
munication in terms of what I
interpreted as 'nomination,"'
she said. "When I spoke of nom-
inating, I meant running with
youMICH and currently being
the youMICH candidate. How-
ever, that's not how (Osborn)
took it."
She said offering the nomi-
nation to a potential candidate
doesn't mean nominating a can-
didate.
"On Monday, when we did
speak with Chris, we did offer
him the youMICH nomination
in terms of if he would like to
run with us," she said. "How-

Egyptian opposition leader
decries mass death threat

ever in terms of who we're run-
ning as candidates and if we're
running (Osborn), there have
been no formal decisions if that
is actually going to happen or
not."
She said the only thing
separating Osborn from being
nominated would be his rejec-
tion.
There was also confusion
about how long Osborn has
to accept the nomination,
but Ruza said the misunder-
standing was inconsequen-
tial.
"If (Osborn) wanted to
wait the weekend ... I think
we'd be open to letting him
(have) the extra day or two,"
she said.
YouMICH is in violation of its
own constitution by not having
already nominated presidential
and vice presidential candi-
dates. Its constitution - which

closely together. Red Hawk
donates a portion of the sales
from their "Michigan Theater
Tuna Melt" to the Michigan

"Having all of those per-
forming arts venues and events
- they're what a lot of the restau-
rants feed off of," Hewitt said. "
I am a very strong supporter
of the relationship between the
arts and private sector."
Many businesses like Red
Hawk sponsor the theater,
which, in turn, promotes the
businesses to their clientele
through coupons.
Jessie Seaver, general manag-
er of Tio's Mexican Cafe, catered
a portion of the Sundance
screening. She said movie-goers
often eat at Tio's after seeing a
film.
"The Michigan Theater does a
good job of promoting the com-
munity, and local businesses do
get a boost when there's an event
there," Seaver said. "Lots of peo-
ple come downtown, go to din-
ner and then grab a drink after
the movie."
Nicole Minney, manager of
Biggby Coffee, said she had been
hearing about the premiere all
week and the coffee shop defi-

in October - states that those
candidates are to be chosen "no
later than the last week in Janu-
ary."
Ruza said that aspect of the
party's regulations should be
reviewed.
Despite being in violation of
its constitution, youMICH is
unlikely to face any substan-
tive response from the Central
Student Judiciary, according
to CSG general counsel Lukak
Garske.
Garske prefaced his state-
ment, saying that CSG hasn't
overseen student organization
registration in several years. He
added that for the CSJ to hear
the case, a student would have
to file a suit against youMICH
claiming harm.
The prerequisites for a
case's consideration make it
likely it would not likely go
further than pretrial, Garske
said.
nitely benefitted from the buzz.
She said the cafe saw an unusual
influx of people from noon until
midnight on Thursday.
"We have a lot of coupons
that go out with the Michi-
gan Theater, so a lot of people
come in here that day, because
our name is out there," Minney
added.
Biggby Coffee also sponsors
a "not-just-for-kids" series of
children's plays at the theater.
Tropical Smoothie Cafe,
which opened less than a year
ago, saw a positive effect on its
business as well. Its manager
Justin Hanna said sales doubled
in the short hour before the pre-
miere started.
Hanna said he saw many new
faces, which he suspects were
people attending the film, and
hopes it brings in new customers
in the future.
'Russ Collins, Executive
Director and CEO of the Michi-
gan Theater, said the Theater's
ties with local businesses help
foster the culture Ann Arbor is
known for.
Emily Mathews, Marketing
Manager of he Theater said she
believes the relationship plays a
large role in the Theater's suc-
cess.
"Our community loves us, and
that enables us to do what we
do."

COMPANY
From Page 1A
Rompf said. "We will hire,
and therefore we thought it
would be a good idea to find
an office that would compen-
sate for that."
Brendan Cavender, a real-
estate broker with Colliers
International, said PRIME
was the "first but not the
last" tenant to approach them
about leases. However, Cav-
ender was unable to disclose
names of other tenants inter-
ested in the property.
"We ended up having mul-
tiple offers from different
.kinds of tech companies,"
Cavender said. "However
(PRIME) moved very quick-
ly, we reached an agreement
with them, and we feel that
they are a great fit for the
space."
Cavender said the arrival of
new IT firms surrounding the
University would be mutually
beneficial for the firms and
the local economy.
"What we are seeing is that
all these tech companies want
to be close to the University,"
Cavender said. "What they
do is that they hire interns
while the students are here,
and then try to hire them full-
time when they graduate."
He sees benefit in the
"young, well-paid employees
who all go out to eat, they all
shop, they all go out for drinks
after work."
As leasing continues, more
IT firms are expected to join
PRIME on the downtown
street. Cavender noted that
a fear of competition among
the firms would not affect the
IT firms's interest in these
leases.
"It's not like they are com-
petitors because they all do
different things," Canvender
said. "I see them more as a
synergy where they all help
each other create this atmo-
sphere."
PRIME is formulating inte-
rior changes to the building
in order to suit their require-
ments, Thomann-Rompf said.
PRIME hopes that the final
interior design will end up
being "very clean, modern
and contemporary."
"We are currently in nego-
tiation with the architect, the
landlord, the interior designer
about the layout of the office,"
Thomann-Rompf said. "Noth-
ing is yet fully decided, but it
will be mostly all open space
with a few walls for office
space."
In addition to the arrival of
new occupants of the Borders
property is the departure of
Pink Pump from East Lib-
erty Street. Randy Mass, an
associate broker with Swisher
Commercial, said although
Pink Pump's business col-
lapsed after Borders closed,
he expected the space to be
leased within the next three
months.
"We're looking for either a
regular retail store or a res-
taurant," Mass said. "We've
had several showings since it
came on the market a week

ago."

Cleric wishes
death upon Morsi
opponents
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's most
prominent opposition leader
criticized the Islamist govern-
ment on Wednesday for its
silence over a Muslim cleric's
edict calling for the death of
opposition supporters.
Mohamed ElBaradei was
responding to well-known
ultraconservative cleric Mah-
moud Shaaban, who said in
a TV show last week that the
opposition should be punished
by death for seeking to bring
down a leader who has been
elected by the public.
"God's verdict is death," he
said amid a new wave of pro-
tests against Islamist President
Mohammed Morsi.
The fatwa, or religious edict,
followed another one by hard-
line cleric Magdi Ghoneim who
said: "I publicly incite to kill the
thugs, criminals, thieves, and
those who burn the country

and kill the innocents."
ElBaradei lamented the
edicts in a message posted on
his Twitter account
"Regime silent as another
fatwa gives license to kill oppo-
sition in the name of Islam,"
he said, adding: "Religion yet
again used and abused."
The edicts caused alarm in
Egypt after a Tunisian oppo-
sition leader critical of the
Islamist-led government there
was assassinated on Wednes-
day.
Tunisia was the first Arab
country to witness a mass
uprising and Egyptians watch
Tunisia for cues on the direc-
tion their own country might
take.
At the same time, Morsi's
office accused the opposition on
Wednesday of benefiting from
the recent wave of violence that
left more than 70 people dead.
Yasser Ali, Morsi's spokesman,
told reporters that the opposi-
tion was using the clashes "as a
means of political pressure."
Egypt has been engulfed in
riots and protests over the past

two weeks.
The mostly liberal opposi-
tion and a large sector of mod-
erate Muslims are demanding
Morsi amend the constitution,
which was passed hurriedly
by an Islamist-led constitu-
ent assembly and approved in
a referendum despite vigorous
opposition objections.
Egypt's powerful military
has warned recently of the "col-
lapse" of the state in mid of
political fragmentation.
Criticism of Morsi's admin-
istration has mounted lately
after a string of violent sexual
assaults on female protesters
in Cairo's Tahrir Square. On
Wednesday, an international
rights group warned mob-
led sexual assaults will only
increase if perpetrators are not
punished.
Amnesty International
said statements from victims
show that the assaults follow
a "clear pattern" where mobs
of men encircle the victims,
assault them with weapons
and hands and then try to
undress them.

Elections had been expected
for the summer, but an exact
date depended on lawmakers
finishing work on a new con-
stitution.
Jebali said the new minis-
ters in the technocratic gov-
ernment "would not belong to
any party and its task would
be limited to organizing elec-
tions as soon as possible with
a neutral administration." The
statement implied that Jebali
would be leading the new gov-
ernment and that its selection
was imminent.
Tunisians overthrew their
long-ruling dictator Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali in January
2011, kicking off a wave of pro-
democracy uprisings across the
Middle East and North Africa
that have met with varying
degrees of success.
With its relatively small,
well-educated population of
10 million, Tunisia has been
widely expected to, have the
best chance of successfully

transitioning to democracy. Its
first post-dictatorship election
brought to power the moderate
Islamists of Ennahda in a coali-
tion with two secular parties.
With the fall of the country's
secular dictatorship, however,
hardline Islamist groups also
have flourished and there have
been a string of attacks by ultra-
conservative Muslims known as
Salafis against arts, culture and
people they deemed to be impi-
ous.
In the last few months,
there also have appeared the
Leagues to Protect the Revolu-
tion, groups that say they are'
fighting corruption and seek-
ing out remnants of the Ben Ali
regime.
But opposition leaders such
as Belaid said the leagues have
become Ennahda-backed goon
squads that attacked opposi-
tion rallies. Last weekend saw
a string of attacks against such
meetings, including a rally held
by Belaid's Popular Front in
northern Tunisia.

'Altruists'to use
humor and politics -

Basement Arts
to present multi-
faceted dark comedy
By REBECCA GODWIN
DailyArts Writer
Four topics not typically con-
sidered funny - murder, sex,
drugs and politics - make up the
primary ingre-
dients in Base- he Altruists
ment Arts's
latest comedy, Thursdayat 7
"The Altru- p.m.,Friday at
ists." 7and11p.m.
The show and Saturday
revolves at7p.m.
around Syd-
ney, who acci-Dama Center

her brother,
the leader of a radical political
group, for help. Her brother has
his own problems with his new
prostitute boyfriend. Throw in a
British playboy and a radical les-
bian who is not actually a lesbian
and what ensues is the award-
winning play by Nicky Silver.
In contrast to most stage pro-
ductions, "The Altruists" has
two directors, Jon Mangan-
ello and Derek Joseph Tran,
both of whom are seniors in
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance. While having two direc-
tors could pose a challenge, the

actors find the two different
opinions helpful.
"Derek likes to focus on the
acting and getting the natural-
istic portrayal across and Jon
likes to'focus on the big picture,
so its not like they're completely
contrasting in their styles of
direction," said MT&D junior
Joe Dunn, who plays Sydney's
British boyfriend Ethan. "They
really complement each other."
Suggestions flow between
the directors and the cast, and
good ideas are never sacrificed
to maintain a particular vision
held by the directors. The actors
are at liberty to try anything
they want, often performing the
same scene multiple ways until
they deliver the best possible
performance.
"As a director, I want to
encourage my actors to be
fearless and to come into the
rehearsal room and bring some-
thing because they all have bet-
ter ideas than I could ever have,"
Manganello said. "I want my
actors to experiment and to play
and to really go all out because I
think that's the most interesting
theater."
A deeper message about the
hypocritical nature of humans
can be found beneath the slap-
stick exterior. The radical
group regularly protests a new
injustice, often mixing up their
causes in the process. Accord-
ing to Manganello, this is the
author's way of mocking those

individuals who claim to be
doing good in the world, but in
reality are not doing anything.
"Altruists are people who try
to help others, but in reality they
are just trying to help them-
selves by helping others," said
MT&D sophomore Elana Gant-
man (Sydney).
With a play that has so many
levels, constant experimentation
has proven vital to the actors in
helping them develop the subtle-
ties of their onstage counter-
parts.
"We did work on characters
in the first week and after that it
became more and more natural to
just slip into it," Dunn explained.
To ensure that their portray-
als remain as realistic as possi-
ble, Manganello and Tran begin
each rehearsal with a series of
warm-up exercises designed to
assist their cast into slipping nat-
urally into their roles. Through
a series of everyday questions
that the actors must respond to
in character, they're able to step
away from the limitations of the
script and just embody the role.
Though the show offers mul-
tiple messages for audience
members to walk away with,
Manganello has a very simple
wish: "I want them to come in,
have a great night at the theater,
have a laugh and, on top of that,
I want them to be able to leave
the theater and have a deeper
conversation about modern-day
politics and social movements."

On a hyped Tuesday night,
Hardaway stole the show

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
As the Michigan men's basket-
ball team was finishing its post-
game celebration after Tuesday's
76-74 overtime win over Ohio
State, Tim Hardaway Jr. led the
team towards the Maize Rage.
The players high-fived the stu-
dents in the sold-out crowd at the
Crisler Center on their way to the
locker room, but the junior guard
stayed a while longer to soak in
the atmosphere of a crowd that,
as he later said, "uplifted (them)
throughout the entire game."
But it really felt like it was
Hardaway's energy that pumped
up the crowd as he took the game
into his own hands when the
third-ranked Wolverines needed
some momentum.
Down by five points midway
through the second stanza in
Tuesday's primetime matchup
against Ohio State, the junior
guard went on a run of his own.
Hardaway hit four consecu-
tive 3-pointers to give Michigan
a 52-50 lead, but more impor-
tantly, he brought the crowd
back to life after the Buckeyes
* had extended their halftime lead
to eight points.
"It was crucial," said fresh-
man forward Mitch McGary.
"(Hardaway) came out shoot-
ing well, and in the second half
he had that spark with (four) in
a row - he kept us in the game.
I didn't really think about it (at
the time), but sometimes (they)
would go on little runs and Tim
would come back with a (3-point-
er) right then."
To McGary, it seemed as if
Hardaway would make a key
shot to shift the momentum in
the Wolverines' favor, and Mich-
igan coach John Beilein said
after the game that Hardaway
was "terrific."

Juniorguard Tim Hardaway Jr. hit four consecutive 3-pointers in Michigan's win over Ohio State on TuesdayU

And once Hardaway got the
hot hand, the coaches gave him
the go-ahead on offense. The
junior finished with a game-
high 23 points while shooting
an impressive 50 percent from
the floor, including a scorching
6-for-9 from beyond the arc.
Aside from his 12 consecutive
points, Hardaway sealed the vic-
tory for the Wolverines with a
block of Ohio State's Aaron Craft
in the final seconds of overtime.
"It was just a reaction," Hard-
away said. "He had the ball up,
I thought he was going to shoot
it. We were up two, I was try-
ing to get the block or force him
to the free-throw line to tie it at
the line, and I just didn't want to
give it up."
Hardaway's performance
on Tuesday is just one of many
instances of the junior stepping
up in big games this season.

Unlike last year, where Hard-
away would go on mini-slumps,
this year, he's come up big in
clutch situations.
First, it was the Preseason
NIT Tip-off at Madison Square
Garden. The Miami, Fla. native
was the MVP of the tournament
as he combined for 39 points over
two games in New York.
Then it was in Brooklyn,,
where Hardaway scored 25
points in Michigan's drubbing of
West Virginia.
And in the past two games,
against then-No. 3 Indiana and
No. 10 Ohio State, Hardaway has
stepped into a larger offensive
role. He had 18 points on 8-of-16
shooting against the Hoosiers,
and was a catalyst in the Wolver-
ines' many runs that helped seal
the game against the Buckeyes.
His improvement is not only
visible in the energy he brings to

the floor, but also in his numbers.
This season, the junior is shoot-
ing 48 percent from the floor and
43 percent from 3-point range.
His clip is similar to last season's
- he shot 41 percent in 2011-12 -
but Hardaway has improved his
shooting from beyond the arc by
15 percent.
Hardaway credits most of this
improvement to "trying to do the
best (he) can to help the team,"
but Beilein has noticed signifi-
cant improvement between his
sophomore and junior cam-
paigns.
"We've been seeing (Tim)
evolve since the summertime,"
Beilein said. "He's done a lot of
work on his own and worked
with different members of our
staff, (and we) know that he can
lead us both with his actions and
how he presents himself to his
teammates."

Wolverines trying to end three-
game skid by hosting Illinois

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
What's wrong with the Michi-
gan women's basketball team?
After getting off to the best
start in program history, includ-
ing a 4-0 start in conference play,
the Wolverines have lost three-
straight, and four of their last five.
So, what's
wrong?

problem. Senior
forward Kate
Thompson is the tallest player on
the floor, at 6-foot-4, but her tal-
ent has never been utilized under
the basket. Instead, her presence
is felt out on the wing. In the first
15 games, Thompson averaged 16
points per game, including 3.96
3-pointers per game, which at
one point was good for first in the
nation.
Thompson's shot, however,
has gone cold. During Michigan's
last five games, Thompson has
averaged 12.2 points per game on
29-percent shooting.
"Kate needs to do a better job,"
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "I -think teams really push
her up and off the screen and
really do not even allow her to use
screens. Every shot she has is pret-
ty much a contest shot."
But it's not only Thompson.
Michigan's five seniors, who
account for 82 percent of the pro-
duction, have been the offensive
leaders all season. Michigan has
also looked to sophomore forward
Nicole Elmblad, who is second on
the team with 6.1 rebounds per
game and is the only underclass-
man to start. Beyond those six
players, though, Michigan has
struggled to find its offense.
The shallow bench has proven

to be a huge problem through-
out the Wolverines' losing streak.
Senior guard Jenny Ryan has
played all but nine of the last 200
total minutes of play, and her
fatigue often shows. With injuries
cripplingthe bench duringthe off-
season, a thin rotation has meant
that the starting five are on the
floor for most of the night.
With players reeling from
fatigue, Michigan is no longer able
to mask its turnover issues with
speed and athleticism.
"The players have to know at
this point in the year that we've
got to be able to bounce back,"
Barnes Arico said. "We need to be
able to regroup, (be) as positive as
we can, but also at the same time
to work on what we need to work
on."
The Wolverines' 61-46 loss to
Michigan State on Monday was
a must-win game, so their game
against Illinois (6-3, 13-8) on
Thursday is even more dire.
Michigan needs both Thomp-
son and senior center Rachel Shef-
fer to shoot out of their slumps if
the Wolverines are to end their
longestlosing streak of the season.
The Fighting Illini have had
the opposite type of season. After
starting off slow, Illinois has

bounced back to win six-straight
road games and six of its last eight
overall. On Monday, the Fight-
ing Illini were named ESPNW's
national team of the week after
winning three games in seven
days.
Senior guard Adrienne God-
bold, who missed the first semes-
ter of play (academic ineligibility),
leads Illinois with 18.6 points per
game in her 10 games back.
In addition, senior forward
Karisma Penn has been the Fight-
ing Illini's most lethal player,
averaging 18.5 points per game
on 50-percent shooting to go with
10.1 rebounds per game. At 6-foot-
2, Penn will find herself matched
up with Thompson in a battle of
scoring forwards.
If Thompson and the Wolver-
ines can break out of their losing
streak, they can still find them-
selves in the thick of the Big Ten
race.
"If we don't improve, it's going
to be a long year," Barnes Arico
said.
A loss would put Michigan in
the bottom five in the conference
standings, making Thursday a
must-win game to save a season
that started off as the best in pro-
gram history.

Michigan wraps up top-10 recruiting class

ByBEN ESTES
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan football team's
2013 recruiting class began to
take shape nearly two years ago,
when Warren, Mich. quarterback
Shane Morris, then nearing the
end of his sophomore year in high
school, committed to the Wolver-
ines.
The class saw a surge in
momentum nine months later,
when eight highly rated high-
school juniors also made verbal
pledges to Michigan in a two-day
span from Feb. 18-19, 2012.
And on Wednesday, the 21 play-
ers that eventually became part
of the 2013 class finally put pen
to paper and signed their Nation-
al Letters of Intent, officially
becoming Wolverines in the pro-
cess. Those players joined the six
early enrollees who were already
on campus and taking classes this
spring.
Unlike during signing days
past, there was no last-minute
drama. Most of Michigan's sign-
ees had been commitments for
months, long past thinking about
playing for other schools.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
had received all 21 letters by early
afternoon on Wednesday, making
for an uneventful signing day -
and thus a "good" day, in Hoke's
view.
"We're very excited about the
group ofyoungmenwho made the
decision to come and play at the
greatest university in this coun-
try," Hoke said.
Hoke has reason to be excited
- he and his coaching staff have
assembled one of the best recruit-
ing classes in the country by any
measure.
Close to 20 of the team's sign-
ees were deemed four- or five-
star recruits by at least one of
the major recruiting websites. As
a group, that amounts to a team
ranking as high 'as No. 2 in the

The addition of Green and the
bolstering of the offensive line
will help the Wolverines move
toward the more traditional style
of offense that they've desired
since Hoke took the job.
Michigan's 2013 class is notable
too for its geography. Hoke has
repeatedly emphasized build-
ing the program through mostly
Midwestern talent, and 22 of the
27 signees are from Ohio, Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan or Pennsylva-
nia.
For the first time in 25 years,
the Wolverines didn't sign a single
recruit from the talent-rich states
of Florida, Texas and California,
but wide receivers coach/recruit-
ing coordinator Jeff Hecklinski
downplayed that fact.
"Let's get the best kids here,"
Hecklinski said. "I don't care
if they come from Canada or
Nebraska. They could come from
the moon. Let's get the best kids
here that can help Michigan win,
wherever that may be.
"(But) we will always take care
of home. We will always take care
of Michigan and we will always
take care of Ohio. That's the his-
tory of Michigan (football)."
NOTES: Hoke said that there
was still no update on whether
senior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner had been granted a medi-
cal redshirt by the NCAA for his
freshman season.
Jackson reported that he was
"shocked" at how well injured
redshirt senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint ran when
Jackson observed his rehab on a
recent morning.
Jackson also said he expects
Toussaint, who suffered a broken
leg against Iowa last season, back
for the beginning of next season.
"He's ahead of schedule, and
I think right now people in the
"training room feel good about
him," Jackson said. "I'm not sure,
but I would expect him to be
back."

Michigan coach Brady Hoke had 21 players sign their National Letters of Intent on Wednesday, cementing one of the best recruiting classes in the country for 2013.

country, according to Scout.com.
Both Rivals.com and RSPN rated
Michigan's class the sixth-best in
the country, coming on the heels
of a 2012 class that was also gener-
ally rated a top-10 group.
More than talent, the 2013 class
of Wolverines is notable for how
tightly knit it is.
Led by Morris, who Hoke
lauded for his recruiting efforts,
the members of the class rapidly
developed close relationships
with each other through visit-
ing Michigan at the same time,
appearing at the same skill camps
and All-Star games and, most
importantly, by engaging each
other over social media.

"Race: Are We So Different"
At first glance, typical museumgoer
expectations are met. The building is an
elementary-school student's fantasy -
prime for exploration, with its dinosaur
skeletons, stuffed possums and built-in
planetarium. Yet among the "standard"
museum gear, the Museum of Natural
History will feature aspecial exhibit this
semester - one that ties in with the Uni-
versity's College of Literature, Science
and the Arts Theme Semester: Under-
standing Race.
The museum will showcase the trav-
eling exhibit "RACE Are We So Differ-
ent?" from Feb. 9 through May 27.
Amy Harris, director of the Museum
of Natural History, first saw the exhibit
in 2007 at the Charles H. Wright Muse-
um in Detroit, and explained the process
of bringing the exhibit to campus.
"I thought it was fantastic, butI ruled
it out because it was too big," she said,
referringto her initial hesitation to bring
the exhibit to the museum.
The exhibit itself was developed by
the American Anthropological Asso-
ciation, in partnership with the Science
Museum of Minnesota. "RACE" takes a
new approach to the study of race and
ethnicity that Harris hopes will spot-
light and enrich conversations about
race.

Frank Provenzano, who works with
Harris on the Understanding Race Proj-
ect, summarized its necessity: "Race is
a part of everything and we need to talk
about it in a very reasonable way - with-
out people thinking we're obsessed with
race. We want a healthier national dis-
course."
LSA senior Noel Gordon, a student
coordinator for the Understanding Race
Project and a member of the theme
semester student steering committee,
noted that conversations about race are
especially applicable to the current col-
lege-age generation of Americans.
"There are a lot of changing demo-
graphics that are happening culturally,
politically (and) socioeconomically that
are all tied with race," Gordon said. "It'll
be really important for us to talk across
difference, so we can move together to
inhabit this new world and take advan-
tage of all the great things it'll have to
offer us."
In order to help the community bet-
ter engage in these conversations about
race, the creation of the Understand-
ing Race Theme Semester led to the
Understanding Race Project, a program
intended to link overlapping audiences
on campus and in the community. The
project involves three audiences: the
University campus community, the K-12
schools and the broader Ann Arbor com-
munity. Beginning in January 2012, the
Understanding Race Project has facili-
tated dozens of workshops in order to
train teachers and administrators in
schools across the district to have con-
versations about race.
As a student coordinator of the proj-
ect, Gordon has participated and led
several of these workshops in various
schools across Ann Arbor. He observed
the applicability of the theme semester
in all three audiences.
"What we're hoping to do is bring
everyone a couple steps closer to having
these conversations and appreciation for
race based on their personal history,"
he said. "It's been interesting to see
(the reactions) of middle- and high-
school students who are just sinking
their teeth into this issue. Some are
anxious; some are scared; some are
excited," he said. "And it's also excit-
ing to see members of this commu-
nity who are perhaps older and have
been doingthis kind of work for along
time."

A community conversation
Harris shed light on the goals of the
9 Understanding Race Project.
"(We aim) to look at race and to
understand it more deeply through the
ways it intersects with other identities
- such as gender, sexual orientations....
A second goal is not only to look at race
in terms of the black-white dichotomy,
but to look at it more broadly. A third
goal is to include local expertise,
so we're highlighting U-M faculty
research aswell as community mem-
bers," she said.
The theme semester student
steering committee accompanies the
Understanding Race Project. It's a stu-
dent organization on campus that works
to captivate all students in various theme
semester events and activities through-
out the term. The group meets weekly
in order to plan the logistics of theme
semester events, and also to collaborate
with other student organizations across
campus.

faces around me stricken with -

plexity, in the least? They looked
unsettled.

present their own - what I
assume are to some minds sur-
prising - facts: Yes, asceticism
persists even in our highly mod-
ernized society, and yes, people
still say such hateful words with
complete and utter conviction.
Together, however, I feel as if
something different elicited
those horrified looks. Pardon
me for hazarding a guess (I can't
know what these people felt),
but perhaps the loud reminder
of a thing called "public space,"
a space that a conflicting chorus
of voices calls home, surprised
them the most.
This idea, especially recently,
has become a rather conten-
tious area of debate. France,
through its legislation banning
face-covering clothing, isndis-
covering just how complicated
the notion of "public space" can
be. For now, within certain lim-
its, we have it, and Ann Arbor,
with its particular urban design,
presents a few spaces that are
ideal for anyone looking for an
audience. While the (relatively)
untamed presence of the public
space terrified me initially, I
have come to realize that not
only should we preserve public
space at all costs but that it also
has a lot of untapped creative
potential.
I am a child of suburban
sprawl. Public space, for the
most part, existed in the walk-
ways in between the shopping
malls - areas whose usage
would indicate lack of personal
transport and therefore class
status. To many among the
comfortable classes, these areas
were feared. Since most of these
walkways in my town weren't
actual sidewalks but instead the
shoulder of the road, the fear
was propped up by the recur-
ring proof of pedestrian deaths
in these areas. On one occasion,
one of my favorite local bands
had made plans to perform in a
park pavilion in my hometown
after their other show had been
canceled. Halfway through the
performance, the police arrived
and kicked them out because
they had not been allowed to
perform there. True, my town
had public parks, but parks stand
far away from everyday life and
regulation by private ownership

quells the spontaneous perfor-
mances and political gestures
that happen all the time in a
place like Ann Arbor.
When I arrived in Ann Arbor,
public space had that unsettling
effect upon me that I thought I
saw in the people viewing the
monks and the firebrands. I
wasn't used to such a forum; life
had become regulated and rou-
tinized; transit and travel were
merely a means to the next part
of the schedule. If anyone ever
thought of these in-between
spaces, they probably did so with
contempt. But in Ann Arbor,
the walkways congest traffic
and slow down movement. This
space between destinations
(class and the coffee shopthe
house and the shop) becomes a
site of activity itself. This is all
obvious stuff. Various organiza-
tions and clubs use it to their
advantage daily. My amazement,
no doubt, is due in part to where
I grew up.
Ann Arbor
areas for all.
But let's dwell on the creative
possibilities that these spaces
offer. What responses do you
think people have had to the
guitar players and blues sing-
ers in the West Hall arch? Is it
silly? Intruding? Pointless or
sad, because "they must have
nothing better to do"? Or is it
viewed favorably? Could it even
be viewed as a blessing?
While Oscar season has us all
trying to pick and choose "the
best" films and performances,
I offer up a call to action for
its antithesis. The context of
public space doesn't presuppose
quality, nor is there an institu-
tion behind the performances,
planning, binding and timing.
And even if people can get "spot-
ted," the space doesn't offer an
item for a resume. Anyone can
partake, the novice and the vir-
tuoso, the professional and the
non-professional, at anytime.
This is not to saythat we should
not build our resumes nor that
the performances at Hill Audito-
rium or the like are necessarily
wrong. I'm writing this because
I want to raise up public space
as another possibility, a site with
a unique set of qualities and
opportunities.
Ann Arbor has a great deal
of public performers: the Violin
Monster, Jack and the Bear,
Brian Woolridge who dances
to Michael Jackson in graffiti
alley or Tom Goss playing the
harmonica and washboard in
the DIAG. I personally have
found these performances the
most enjoyable, and not on any
grounds of good or bad art, but
simply because they always
catch me off guard.

"Art for me is like religion
because, without it, I getlost."
A world-renowned ceramist,
Sadashi Inuzuka's transcendent
art is celebrated for exploring
the overlap between the natural
world, science and society. Over
the past 20 years, Inuzuka has
exhibited his work to national and
an international audiences. Cur-
rently, he is an associate professor
at the Penny W. Stamps School of
Art & Design.
"I was born and raised in
Japan," Inuzuka said. "Japan is a
democratic country, yet when you
are there, youhave an obligation to
society, an obligation to your fam-
ily, and there are so many other
elements like religion, culture and
tradition. Japan's social structure
is not obvious under the layers of
social hierarchy."
After having been deemed
legally blind, Inuzuka was dis-
couraged from pursuing a career
in the arts, but he used his visual

Brater considers the arts as a tool for cor
impairment as a motivation to
reach out to other disabled indi-
viduals and to help them discover
their own artistic identities.
"I did not feel free," he said. "I
grew up in a very rigid manner. I
was a very sensitive kid, butI could
not show that. When I was a young
boy, I wanted to come to America
because that's almost the opposite
of that experience. Here, there's
the possibility to be someone.
You'll be given chances no matter
where you come from or who you
are - that's my belief."
Inuzuka's college experience
was different than that of most stu-
dents. He was 30 years old when he
attended college in Canada, but it
was not his age that set him apart,
but rather his experience.

"I could not go to college in
Japan," lie said. "I was a very
different student. I was always
against that rigid structure, so
until (age) 30, I was working in
many different jobs, but I always
believed that I could do something.
I failed so many times. My life was
never smooth. I realize now how
hard it is tobe an artist, and work-
ing hard is simply not enough."
Inuzuka has gone on to receive
world-wide recognition for his
innovative work in the field of
ceramics. He is the recipient of
multiple awards and grants, some
of which include The Canada
Council for the Arts, The National
Association of Japanese Canadians
Project Grant, The Ontario Arts
Council Crafts Grant and The Brit-

ish Columbia Cultural Fund Schol-
arship.
Regardless of the prominence
and respect that he has gained as
an artist, Inuzuka considers art an
essential part of his life.
"I'm not working for recogni-
tion. I'm working for myself. I
need that freedom of art to really
think about who I (am) and why
I'm here."
Inuzuka said he emphasizes
this way of thinking to his stu-
dents.
"I'm not sure what I can teach.
All I can teach is my experience. I
want to teach about the freedom
in art because that's the reason
why I'm here and, for me, that's
never changed."

Yu's exploration of human "I've directed and acted in

surprising how theatrically
powerful that play is," Liu said.
"I feel Cao Yu's concerns over
human relations and anxieties
transcend ideological divides.
That's certainly one of the rea-
sons behind his staying power."
According to Liu, due to
the controversial subject mat-
ter, "Thunderstorm" vacated
the stage for 30 years ' after
the Communist takeover.
But Liu mentioned that edit-
ing the play in subsequent
productions fosters a much
greater ideological problem.
"When it was first produced
in 1935 in Japan, they took out
the prologue and the epilogue
because the play was three-and-
a-half hours, and it was so long.
But the problem is that without
those, the (themes) of Cao Yu's
plays like fate, forgiveness and
suffering become restricted."
As the president of the Associ-
ation for Asian Performance, Liu
featured the Yu exhibit at their
annual conference, held together
with the Association for Theatre
in Higher Education conference
last August in Washington D.C.
Liu attends conferences often,
but he seldom travels for lec-
tures, which makes his presen-
tation in Ann Arbor a rare and
special occasion. He commented
on the opportunity to speak
about Yu as part of the exhibit at
the University, and gave a quick
preview of his upcoming presen-
tation.
"I want to emphasize that
the time when Cao Yu was most
active - the early decades of
the 20th century - he was very
much aware of world theatrical
traditions and was fearless with
his formal experiments that
allowed him to best express his
angst of life around him."
Liu described how contem-
porary productions of Yu's work
as a whole haven't reached their
full creative capacity.
"For a variety of reasons, the
mainstream reading and staging
of his plays have been unable to
fully realize the potential of his
works. I will present one direc-
tor, Wang Yansong, who has in
the past decade staged impres-
sive reinterpretations of Cao
Yu's three masterpieces that
have the potential to bring a new
understanding of Cao Yu, seven
decades after he burst into the
scene."
The Yu exhibit, featuring two
screenings of his most famous
work and a promising presenta-
tion by Liu, illuminates the rich
history of drama in China dur-
ing the 20th century - onstage
and off.

Unremarkable
Broken Egg

Breakfast food is my jam
(pun totally intended):
It's easy, cheap, delicious
and - for the most part - hard
to screw up. But just like any
other meal,
it's about the
experience
just as much f
as it's about
the food.
Isn't there
something
peacefully NATE
quaint about WOOD
starting a
snowy Sat-
urday at the breakfast table,
wrapped in a soft blanket and
peering out at the winter won-
derland from your cozy kitchen?
Doesn't the plate of hot food and
cup of steaming coffee sitting
before you warm your heart and
soul as much as your stomach?
Yeah, well during the school
year, ain't nobody got time for
that. So instead, we settle for
a bitterly icy, arduous schlepp
to some noisy joint where they
serve us cheap coffee and watery
eggs.
Welcome to The Broken Egg.
Situated on North Main Street
just outside of Kerrytown, The
Broken Egg is a humble little
spot worth checking out when
all of the other breakfast places
in Ann Arbor have lines hanging
out the door - lines of frostbit-
ten, hungry people. The food is
as mediocre as it comes, and the
restaurant, well, it's a sight to
behold.
The misleadingly classy
brick exterior doesn't prepare
you for what lies within. Pic-
ture someone eating an entire
Big Ten-themed gift shop and
then proceeding to projectile
vomit it all over the walls in an
unfathomably random manner.
Oh, but it gets better: a life-size
baby moose stuffed animal,
year-round Christmas lights and
garland, fake hardwood tables,
functioning garage lights, teal
vinyl chairs and - in one corner
- cheap reprints of famous-ish
paintings (famous enough that I
recognize them, but not famous
enough that I know the names
... pretty sure one is stolen from
Olive Garden). Truthfully, I've
seen similar-looking nursing
homes.
And don't even get me started
on the treasure hunt that is
trying to find the bathroom. If
you've been here before, you
know what I mean.
But let's not be too judgmen-
tal. We haven't even gotten to
the food yet.
My friends and I order an
assortment of breakfast items.
Some are surprisingly tasty, and
some are ... not. On the whole,
most are just OK.
The Salute to the Bees French
Toast is the day's special, so one
of us orders that. There's the
bad (burnt candied pecans and
a disappointingly small number
of banana slices), and the good
(the perfect amount of caramel,
a thick and gooey cinnamon
topping and freshly whipped
cream).
The San-Francisco Chocolate
Chip Pancakes are generously
filled with chocolate chips but
are tough, dry and altogether fla-

vorless. Asa special treat, straw-
berries of questionable freshness
are also plopped on top. Side
note: Am I missing something,

or is there absolutely no reason
these pancakes are named after
San Francisco?
The first real hit of the meal is
my Bread Pudding French Toast.
Made with thick, Texas-style
slices of raisin bread soaked in a
rich, cinnamon-scented egg and
cream batter and fried on ashot,
buttered griddle, this toast is not
merely palatable, but a real treat
to eat. It is soft and supple in the
middle, crispy and browned on
the edges, just the right amount
of sweet and surprisingly, pleas-
antly tart from the raspber-
ries on top. Though it could be
improved with a few toasted,
slivered almonds dashed atop
the dollops of whipped cream,
I'm still a fan.
About the breakfast meat -
which is, for me, an essential
component of any hearty break-
fast out - I'm utterly blas. My
favorite - breakfast sausage
patties - are not even offered;
the links are absolutely standard,
though these truly are difficult
to make "standouts," and the
bacon is nothingbut limp and
chewy. None of it is good nor
is it exceptionally bad, and I'm
definitely still bitter about hav-
ing to be bereaved over sausage
patties.
Last on the list are the
omelettes, which appease but
don't "wow" me. I would say
they're pretty comparable to
something you or I could make
at home. The combinations of
ingredients for the specialty
omelettes range from exotic to
expected, coming together to
form a taste falling more toward
the latter. But still, a four-egg
omelette, a side of hash browns
and four slices of toast for just
over $8 really isn't bad.
The omelettes
are fine, but
where are the
sausage patties?!
So let's recap: The omelettes
are decent and also a respect-
ably good value; the French
toast is truly delicious, and
everything else is pretty much
your typical small-town-diner,
breakfast-food fare.
So why make the arduous
schlepp over? Well, I've heard
the dry toast is pretty good
if that's all you're in need of
some Sunday mornings (or
afternoons - I don't judge). But
besides that, how about when
those strange family members
of yours come in for football
games and expect you to recom-
mend a place for brunch?
I can think of a few people
for whom The Broken Egg
would be just the ticket. You
know, the ones too stingy to eat
at Cafe Zola, too lazy to drive
to the Northside Grill and too
impatient to wait at Angelo's.
Your Aunt Judy, the hoarder,
will feel right at home. That
senile grandma who's lost her
taste buds? I'm sure she'll love
it. Just don't expect her to be
able to find the bathroom.

sausage patties. To join,

MARLENE LACASSE/Daily

The Museum of Natural History will feature the traveling exhibit "RACE: Are We So Different?" from Feb. 9 through May 27.

RACE
From Page 1B
"We'll be trying to do some-
thing around the Fab Five bas-
ketball team," said Gordon. "The
Fab Five is an important part of
Michigan athletics history, and
we'll look at that conversation
intersected with issues of race and
class."
The student steering commit-
tee hopes to invite a member of
the Fab Five to come to campus
to speak and to host a discussion
about the evolving nature of race
and class in athletics.
Other events throughout the
semester will include a LGBT
community summit called Color
of Change, which plans to delve
into the experiences of LGBT and
people of color. Additionally, the
student steering committee plans
to create panels, discussions and
lectures that feature both people
of color as well as other profes-
sionals who have studied race or
worked in racial issues.
Outside of the steering com-
mittee, the Understanding Race
Project also works to implement
community events that center
around the theme semester. These
events include monthly teen sci-
ence cafes revolving around race
and topics such as public health
and law, hosted at the Museum
of Natural History. Speakers are
invited to debate such issues at
these monthly conversations, fol-
lowed by an audience discussion.
Furthermore, the Understanding
Race Project has implemented a
vast array of film screenings, pan-
els and discussions across local
venues such as Zingerman's, the
Hatcher Graduate Library and
the Matthaei Botanical Gardens
throughout the term.
The Museum of Natural His-
tory also created a supplement to
the "RACE" exhibit within the
museum itself. Titled "Race in
this Place: A Community Con-
versation," the additional exhibit
attempts to highlight race in
four thematic areas: education,
health, the legal system and
immigration. In each of the four
areas, the exhibit showcases
local community organizations
that delve into conversations
about race in those areas. "Race
in this Place" includes many joint
projects with community orga-
nizations, including the Neutral
Zone's Students Educating Each
other about Diversity (SEED)
program.
A metaphor for identity
Danny Brown, one of the co-
directors of SEED at the Neutral
Zone, described the mission of
the program.
"It's not just talking at kids
about diversity," he said. "But it's
bringing their life experiences
into a room together and cel-
ebrating difference and discov-
ering how their own lives fit into
larger context in society in a way
that's entwined."
Brown helps lead the program
of Ann Arbor high-school stu-
dents, who are trained to facili-
tate conversations about youth
with other youth in the commu-
nity.
"(The youth) have intense dia-

logues on race that focus on, not
only people understanding their
own race, but how their race fits
in a system and what that means
in their position in society,"
Brown said.
Within the local museum
exhibit, SEED teens were also
featured in a video alongside
community members, in which
all discussed race relations with-

in the Ann Arbor community.
The exhibit also features a
unique art project created by the
SEED youth. Lined behind a glass
case, goggles were splashed with
various Sharpie colors - featuring
bubble letters, drawings of hockey
sticks and other graphic designs.
"We ask (teens) to think about
their race, gender, social class and
other factors, and we ask them
after reflecting that to transpose
some of those elements of them-
selves onto these goggles," Brown
said.
The teens then wore the gog-
gles at a weekend retreat, and
looked at each other through their
goggle creations - examining one
another through their construct-
ed identities.
"It becomes a metaphor for
identity - identity being a frame
for how you make decisions, build
relationships," Brown explained.
"It's also a metaphor for how peo-
ple perceive you, because while
you're looking at someone's gog-
gles, other people are also looking
at you and making assumptions
about your goggles." In this way,
students are able to view their
identities through interaction
about race with others.
Alex Kime, a senior at Skyline
High School, is a SEED student
facilitator. He believes working in
the SEED program alongside the
theme semester has helped him
examine his own race in relation
to others.
"As a white person, it's my privi-
lege to not be as affected by race as
someone who's a person of color,"
Kime said. "You have to always
think about your own privilege,
and it's always an act of unlearn-
ing. SEED helped me look at that."
Student interactions with race
are happening within classrooms
at the University as well. Accord-
ing to Harris, there are approxi-
mately 130 theme semester
courses currently being offered.
For Evelyn Alsultany, associate

professor of American Culture,
these classes offer crucial dia-
logue about race that need to hap-
pen on college campuses in order
to make others reflect upon the
changingnature of race.
"Through the theme semester,
we want to shed light on the dif-
ferent ways of understanding this
as part of a larger history of race
and racism that we are still in the
process of overcoming," Alsul-
tany said. "If we ignore it or deny
it then how (are we supposed) to
improve it?"
A legacy ofunderstanding
"As students at this University
who are going to be future leaders
and citizens, (it's important) to be
able to leave here more in tune to
how race manifests today. It might
manifest differently," Alsultany
said. "Today, race doesn't look
like slavery. Race doesn't look like
segregation. Race changes over
time."
Alsultany is teachingtwo theme
semester courses: AMCULT 218,
"22 Ways to Think About Race,"
and AMCULT 235: "From Harems
to Terrorists: Representing the
Middle East in Hollywood Cin-
ema."
At noon on Monday in her "22
Ways to Think About Race" class,
70 students packed into the Mason
Hall room. Some chatted ami-
ably; some yanked out sheets of
notebook paper from bags; others
nursed cans of fruit juice. Near the
front of the room sat Anthropology
Prof. Milford Wolpoff, the guest
speaker for the day.
Wolpoff addtessed the students
with a fierce and raspy voice while
presenting a PowerPoint on "The
Science of Race & Racism." He
discussed how race is linked to
human evolution, showing slides
detailing a history of race in sci-
entific study. Peering at the class,
he emphasized in a booming voice
that human evolution and race are

connected. Next, he detailed the
importance of diversity in race.
"Race invariably also means
racial prejudice. And we're never
going to get rid of prejudice ... but
we can and must learn how to cel-
ebrate our diversity," he said. "As
an evolutionist, I can say if we all
became the same, evolutionists
would have nothing to work with.
What we need to be successful is
variety."
Part of the larger signature "22
Ways" courses that accompany
each theme semester, "22 Ways to
Think About Race" brings in guest
speakers from various disciplines
- including linguistics, commu-
nications and medicine - to high-
light the ways in which race exists
across a wide spectrum of fields.
Alsultany hopes that through
teaching theme semester courses,
she can illuminate the pressing
necessity of understanding race in
our communities.
"I think it's important to look
at where we are and not deny the
progress, but not assume that we
are now an equal world," she said.
For many, the ultimate goal of
the theme semester is that its leg-
acy will stretch beyond this semes-
ter.
"I really hope that we can take
this model of how to talk about
a very complicated subject of
race, (and apply it to) how can we
become less violent as a society;
how we can talk about economic
disparity; how we can talk about
gender in an open way," Provenz-
ano said.
Harris agreed, noting the
change already occurring on cam-
pus, including the University's
documentation of faculty research
on race; the training sessions on
race discussions for teachers and
colleagues; and positive reactions
to teacher facilitation in race dia-
logue.
"A stronger community of peo-
ple committed to racial justice is
already forming," Harris said.
