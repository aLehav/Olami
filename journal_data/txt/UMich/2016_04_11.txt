 Concert funds 
to be donated to 
initiatives in the 

city

By JENNIFER MEER

Daily Staff Reporter

This 
Wednesday, 
MUSIC 

Matters 
will 
team 
up 
with 

Consider Magazine to incorporate 
the Detroit Village in their fifth 
annual SpringFest.

SpringFest 
is 
a 
day-long 

festival located on the University 
of Michigan Diag and North 
University Avenue that aims to 
bring together a wide array of 
student organizations, musicians 
and entrepreneurs. Detroit Village 
will be a display at Springfest 
featuring Detroit businesses.

MUSIC Matters said their goal 

is to improve the University’s 
relationship 
with 
the 
city. 

Proceeds from the SpringFest hip 
hop trio Migos concert, beginning 
at 8 p.m. at Hill Auditorium, will go 
to MUSIC Matters’ summer camp 

for children in Detroit, which is set 
to begin in 2017.

“Our goal for the event is 

to address the student body’s 
weakened 
relationship 
with 

Detroit,” a press release reads. “In 
the past, the University has held 
close ties with the city through 
which the nation’s best and 
brightest have been funneled to 
jobs in Detroit.”

Connection with Detroit has 

been a focus for multiple student 
organizations in recent weeks. LSA 
sophomore Dylan Bennett, the 
co-chair of the CSG Commision 
on Detroit Engagement, presented 
a 
resolution, 
which 
recently 

passed in the Central Student 
Government, 
to 
extend 
the 

University’s current contract with 
the MDetroit Connector — a bus 
that travels from Ann Arbor to 
Detroit. The resolution was passed 
last Tuesday. 

Bennett said in an interview, 

the University has a weakened 
relationship with the city to an 
extent.

University actually shut down

University sees 3 
percent increase 
in greenhouse gas 

emissions

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan’s 

2015 
Sustainability 
Progress 

Report, 
released 
last 
week, 

identified 
several 
key 
areas 

that 
require 
improvement 

for the University to meet its 
sustainability goals.

One large category was the 

amount of waste sent to landfills, 
a sign of effective food waste 
composting. 
The 
University’s 

stated goal for 2025 is to reduce 
it by 40 percent. According to the 
report, by the end of 2015, it had 
been reduced 1.7 percent.

Energy 
conservation 
and 

greenhouse gas emissions saw 
similar trends. For these areas, 
the report drew on numbers from 

Energy Management — a division 
within Plant Operations at the 
University — which monitors 
the energy use of buildings on 
campus, tracking their heating 
and air conditioning systems 
and 
implementing 
energy 

conservation 
measures 
in 

academic buildings.

For the past six years, the 

program 
has 
recorded 
an 

8-percent 
annual 
reduction 

in energy consumption in the 
buildings 
it 
was 
responsible 

for. However, the report said it 

remains unclear whether or not 
this reduction will continue at 
the same rate once the University 
of 
Michigan 
Health 
System, 

University Housing and athletics 
are 
incorporated 
into 
the 

program. As well, according to the 
report, the University is currently 
progressing negatively toward its 
goal of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions by 25 percent by 2025, 
instead increasing emissions by 3 
percent as of this year.

Governing body 

pushes to continue 

Detroit to Ann 
Arbor service

By JENNIFER MEER

Daily Staff Reporter

Among 
other 
agenda 

items, before they ended the 
year 
on 
Tuesday 
Central 

Student Government passed 
a resolution to encourage the 
Office of the President and the 
Office of the Provost to extend 
the contract for the MDetroit 
Center Connector — the bus 
that runs between Ann Arbor 
and Detroit — for spring 2016.

The connector has had 

problems with maintaining 
funding in the past. Initially, 
in 2013, the project received 
$153,000 from the University 
to 
run 
on 
a 
four-day 

schedule. In June 2015, the 
University planned to end the 
connector’s 
services 
when 

grant funding had expired 

and ridership was found to be 
insufficient. However, prior to 
the resolution, the connector’s 
current contract, which began 
in spring 2015, would expire 
at the end of the 2016 winter 
term.

Public Policy sophomore 

Dylan Bennett, co-author of 
the resolution and co-chair 
of the CSG Detroit Congress, 
said 
after 
successful 
but 

small 
outreach 
events 
in 

previous years, such as a 
panel of speakers to discuss 
job opportunities in Detroit 
that 
brought 
in 
only 
50 

people, the commission really 
wanted to redefine its role 
through projects like these. 
The CSG Detroit Congress 
aims to bring together student 
organizations that are working 
to discuss and improve Ann 
Arbor’s 
relationship 
with 

Detroit.

“This year we said, ‘We’re 

a student government body. 
Let’s 
facilitate 
discussion. 

Let’s be the leading body on 
bettering 
the 
University’s 

relationship with Detroit,’ ” 

Organizers cite 
positive portrayal 
of culture as motive 

for event 

By NISA KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

A video highlighting issues 

students have had with the 
University of Michigan’s Arabic 
language 
classes 
kicked 
off 

Friday’s annual Arab Xpression 
show, which celebrates Arabic 
culture through dances, skits and 
songs.

In explaining the event to the 

audience in the Rogel Ballroom, 
Arab Student Association hosts 
and LSA seniors Lana Abdole 
and Devin Jones emphasized the 
uniqueness of Arab Xpression — 
as the only Arab culture show of 
its kind at the University — and 
the importance of combating 
negative stereotypes in light of 
recent events on campus. 

In an interview, Abdole echoed 

these sentiments.

“We wanted the opportunity to 

use the culture show to show you 
other side of things as opposed 
to the stereotypes in the public,” 
she said. “Arabesque, the dance 
group that performs, is the only 
traditional Arab dance group on 
campus. Specifically, this year we 
really wanted the show to provide 
a platform for people of Arab 
heritage to reclaim what it means 
to be Arab.”

Researchers aim 
to keep organs 

beating longer during 

transport

By SOPHIE SHERRY

Daily Staff Reporter

University of Michigan doctors 

will soon participate in a clinical 
trial that could transform heart 
transplants in the United States.

Since the first heart transplant 

surgery nearly 40 years ago, the 
methods of transporting a donor 
heart from hospital to hospital 
have remained the same. The 
donor heart is retrieved, placed in 
a bag of saline inside of a bag of ice 
then inside another bag of ice and 
stored in a cooler. This current 
technique allows the heart to be 
in transit for four to six hours, 
with transplantation becoming 
increasingly riskier after four. 

The new clinical trial test the 

effectiveness of the Transmedics 
Organ 
Care 
System 
which 

continues to circulate blood to 
the donor heart while in transit, 
theoretically allowing the heart 
to be in transit for a greater period 
of time. It also enables doctors to 
use hearts from extended criteria 
donors — older donors who may 
have experienced health issues in 
the past.

The University of Michigan 

Health System is one of 12 
programs 
participating 
in 

the clinical trial, testing the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
system 

in 
comparison 
to 
traditional 

methods. Frank Pagani, surgical 
director of the Adult Heart 
Transplant 
Program, 
and 

cardiologist Keith Aaronson are 
two of the University doctors 
working on the clinical trial.

The Organ Care System has 

already been tested in the United 
States on normal criteria patients, 
but this trial will focus primarily 
on those extended criteria donors.

“We are trying to use this new 

machine to use the organs that we 
may not necessarily want to use, 
so we call those extended criteria 
donors,” Pagani said. “Generally 
we do not like to exceed four hours 
where the new heart is out of the 
body until it goes back into the 
recipient, or we do not typically 
take hearts from patients that are 
older.”

Aaronson said ORS is used 

extensively 
in 
England 
and 

Australia, where it is an approved 
system and doctors are able to 
use either standard donors or 
extended criteria donors.

“We are more cautious in the 

U.S. than other countries, so this 
study is more of a baby step, but 
it’s a first step to get us there,” 
Aaronson said.

The 
Food 
and 
Drug 

Administration recently approved 
modifications to the ORS, meaning 

the 12 programs participating in 
the study must undergo another 
round of training within the 
month for those modifications. 
After that training is complete, the 
University will be ready to utilize 
the new system once it finds a 
donor that meet the criteria.

Pagani and Aaronson said 

they do not anticipate any real 
challenges in implementing this 
system, aside from finding the 
right donor.

“The biggest issue is of course 

transplantation is so limited, there 
are only about 2,000 donors in 
the United States each year, so it 
becomes difficult waiting for an 
organ,” Pagani said. “We have to 
wait for the right type of donor 
organ and that can take some time. 
So we have to be sort of patient 
and the progress of the trial may 
be slow just based on the number 
of heart transplants that are done 
in the US.”

Both Pagani and Aaronson 

said 
they 
expect 
that 
the 

implementation of this system will 
increase the size of the donor pool 
in the United States.

“The hope is that we will be 

able to take hearts that are more 
marginal or good, not particularly 
high risk but would be transported 
a further distance, and be able to 
use them with success,” Aaronson 
said. “We would certainly open 
up the number of donors that are 
available and increase the donor 
pool.”

Twitter chat discusses mental 
health and sexual misconduct

University leaders 
answer student 
questions about 
campus efforts

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Friday, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan used Twitter to open up 
dialogue within the University of 
Michigan community surrounding 

sexual misconduct and mental 
health.

The online conversation was 

held in an effort to erase the stigma 
attached to both major issues, as 
well to promote awareness of them.

Multiple members of campus 

were 
panelists 
for 
the 
talk, 

including Cooper Charlton, former 
Central 
Student 
Government 

president and Wolverine Support 
Network 
co-founder; 
Holly 

Rider-Milkovich, Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
director; Dr. Bob Winfield, chief 

health officer and director of 
University 
Health 
Services; 

John Greden, executive director 
of the U-M Depression Center; 
and Todd Sevig, Counseling and 
Psychological Services director. 

Sexual misconduct and mental 

health have both been topics of 
significant discussion on campus 
throughout the past year. This 
past week, the University released 
the full text of its revised sexual 
misconduct 
policy 
following 

a 
year-long 
revision 
process. 

The 
new 
policy 
includes 
an 

expanded definition of what is 
prohibited conduct, adjustments 
to the definition of consent and the 
consolidation of the sanctioning 
and appeals process.

At the last Board of Regents 

meeting held March 20, Charlton 
drew the board’s attention to the 
issue of mental health on campus 
following the recent death of a 
University student earlier that 
week. 
Throughout 
his 
term, 

Charlton has advocated for an 
increased staff of mental health 
professionals in the Counseling 
and Psychological Services on 
campus, citing the “gold standard” 
as one counselor for every 1,000 
students. CAPS currently falls 
short 
of 
this 
standard, 
and 

students have said they continue to 
experience significant wait times 
before meeting with mental health 
professionals.

In response to a question asking 

for specific statistics related to 
mental health illness on campus,

On Friday, the NCAA Division 

I council announced it would 
prohibit FBS football coaches 
from 
hosting 
or 
working 
at 

camps outside of their respective 
universities, effectively ending the 
era of the satellite camp. Satellite 
camps typically entail coaches 
setting up camps in an area outside 
of their typical recruiting ground 
to observe players they might not 
otherwise see. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh has become the 
face of these camps recently, 
and he held a series of them last 

summer in Alabama, Florida, 
Texas, California, Pennsylvania 
and Indiana.

But Harbaugh faced criticism 

from coaches — especially from 
the Southeastern and Atlantic 
Coast Conferences — who were 
forbidden from holding these 
camps due to conference rules. 
The 10 FBS conferences voted by 
a 6-4 margin to prohibit coaches 
from holding them going forward.

Some Michigan football players 

expressed 
disappointment 
at 

the decision, believing it hurts 

high 
schoolers 
who 
cannot 

afford to travel to camps held at 
a distant university. Many of the 
Wolverines speaking out against 
the NCAA ban felt they benefited 
from camps such as Detroit’s 
Sound Mind Sound Body camp, 
and they took to Twitter to show 
their frustrations.

“No 
satellite 
camps 
no 

exposure!” said senior offensive 
lineman David Dawson. “SMSB 
helped me achieve the goals that 
I have achieved so far and it also 
helped me achieve goals that I have 
achieved so far and it also helped 

other inner city kids turn their 
dreams of going to a (Division 1) 
institution into reality.”

Senior fullback Khalid Hill, a 

Detroit native, emphasized the 
effect the of the ruling on his 
native city.

“I was one of the under the 

radar kids coming from the city 
of Detroit,” Hill wrote. “I was 
fortunate enough to have a family 
who supported me and sacrificed 
(sic) for me to go to these places.”

Bennett said. 

Extending 
the 
connector 

service was a big part of that 
mission, 
he 
added, 
noting 

that meetings of the Congress 
and meetings with University 
Provost Martha Pollack on this 
topic have been taking place 
since Fall of 2014.

Bennett said at the end of 

May, the Office of the Provost 
will determine the fate of the 
connector based on data they’ve 

collected about connector usage 
and other surveys.

After 
the 
resolution 
was 

passed, CSG President Cooper 
Charlton sent out one such 
survey to the entire student body 
to assess student usage of and 
want for the connector in the 
future.

In the e-mail, Charlton wrote 

that the school’s historic link to 
Detroit is one important reason 
why the two should remain 
connected.

“As many of you are well aware, 

Detroit is not only a city with 
immense cultural, academic, and 

historical significance, but also 
the original site of the University 
of Michigan,” he wrote. “As we 
transition into our third century 
of 
academic 
excellence 
and 

achievement in 2017, it is vital 
that we strengthen and affirm 
our deep connection to the City of 
Detroit.”

University 
alum 
Nicole 

Stallings, who graduated in 2007, 
and is the current senior policy 
adviser to the Detroit mayor 
and former Muslim Students’ 
Association 
president, 
told 

CSG during Tuesday’s meeting 
that the city has significantly 

impacted her professional life.

Stallings 
said 
when 
she 

graduated from the University in 
2007, not many students aspired 
to live and work in Detroit. 
Today she works on projects 
in economic development, real 
estate and mobility, with the hope 
of attracting college graduates.

“The 
landscape 
there 
is 

completely different,” she said. “I 
spend my day working on a ton of 
different cool projects that we’re 
hoping will attract people like 
you guys to want to live and work 
and play in the city of Detroit 
after you graduate.”

Trump, a native New Yorker, in 
the lead in his home state with 
54-percent support among voters. 
Following Trump, John Kasich 
has 22 percent of voter support. 

Among the pool of Democratic 

candidates, Clinton is in the 
lead at 53 percent compared to 
Bernie Sanders’ 37 percent. Both 
individuals have ties to the state: 
Clinton is a former senator from 
New York, and Sanders hails from 
Brooklyn.The New York primary 
will take place on April 19.

A similar breakdown 

characterizes the Pennsylvania 
primary projections. Trump 
holds 48 percent of Republican 
voter support, while 22 percent 
support Kasich. Democratic 
voters support Clinton with 49 
percent, 11 points more than 
Sanders. The Pennsylvania 
primary is scheduled for April 26. 

Clinton and Trump faced 

recent challenges on the 
campaign road following losses 
in last Tuesday’s Wisconsin 
primary.

DPS Board of 
Education files 
lawsuit against 
state 

The Detroit Public Schools 

Board of Education filed a federal 
lawsuit against the state of 
Michigan last Thursday, reported 
the Detroit Free Press. The claim 
accuses the district’s emergency 
manager of violating DPS 
students’ civil rights.

The lawsuit is pending 

approval by a judge.

In addition to the emergency 

manager, the lawsuit names Gov. 
Rick Snyder, lawmakers, former 
emergency managers and several 
administrators. Currently, 
a dozen former and current 
principals are being charged with 
“running a $1 million kickback 
and bribery scheme.”

Since 2009, state-appointed 

emergency managers have been 
running DPS; however, prior to 
this change, the state ran the 
district from 1999 to 2007.

The lawsuit claims that 

students have had their civil 
rights violated after this 
transition, marked by the lack of 
resources available to students. 
One attorney on the case cited 
the fact that the Michigan 
Legislature has had to allocate 
$48.7 million to the district to 
prevent DPS from running out of 
money.

Contamination in 
Ypsilanti’s Water 
Street property

Ypsilanti has closed a portion 

of the Border to Border Trail 
in the Water Street property 
late Friday night due to 
contaimination, according to 
MLive. 

High levels of Polychlorinated 

Biphenyls (PBCs) were 
discovered in a preliminary 
environmental test conducted 
by the city. The contamination 
appears to be confined to an 
isolated portion of the trail 
and Water Street Property, and 
officials reassured residents that 
the surrounding area is clear.

While the city expects 

further updates by the end of 
April, officials are working to 
develop a cleanup plan to remove 
contaminated surface soil and 
replacing it with clean soil.

Soil contamination caused 

the city to stop plans for a $12 
million, 80-unit housing complex 
in Water Street Property’s 
southeast corner. The city’s 
environmental consultant was 
tasked with analyzing 20 years 
of records in November, and the 
results led to the trail’s close.

In the video that began the 

night, students said they believe 
the Arabic classes politicize the 
language instead of teaching 
basic words. Students mentioned 
jokingly that schools in Arab 
countries probably would be 
taught about the United States 
by stereotypes of Americans 
through watching media like “It’s 
Always Sunny in Philadelphia” 
and “Jersey Shore.” 

Student 
performances 

included 
traditional 
dances 

such as an all-male performance 
of Dahke, a style of dance 
and music that involves foot-
stomping and sticks originating 
in countries like Palestine. The 
dance was originally created to 
pass time when doing chores. 
Another performance included 
an original rap piece, “Hello” 
by Adele with an Arabic style 
twist, poetry discussing the Arab 
identity and skits that parodied 
“Who Wants to Become a 
Millionaire?”

LSA freshmen Zoha Qureshi 

and Hafsa Thias said they 
enjoyed seeing what they called 
the rare and positive display of 
Arab culture.

“I really enjoyed it. It’s really 

fun — I loved all of the dances 
and skits,” Qureshi said. “It’s 
really empowering. I am really 
awed by the rich culture.”

Thias added that the show 

was a break from the negativity 
in campus.

“(The 
rich 
culture) 
is 

something 
I 
haven’t 
seen,” 

he said. “There’s been a lot of 
negative rhetoric around campus 
right now. Being able to see 
the culture is pretty cool and 
empowering.”

The event also celebrated Arab 

heritage with an educational 
video about Arabs across the 
world, 
highlighting 
scientific 

discoveries and notable figures. 
The video ended with the words 
“Arabs Changed The World” on 
the screen. 

LSA junior Tina Alkhersan 

said the show allowed her to 
enjoy her culture in a way not 
typically portrayed in media.

“I’m Arab, I’m from Iraq, 

and so it’s nice to see other 
Arabs come together and gather 
together 
and 
celebrate 
the 

culture,” Al-Khersan said. “So 
often, it’s not celebrated in the 
media.”

Xpression also included a 

fashion show, in which a female 
and male student displayed 
the 
traditional 
clothing 
of 

Arab countries, such as Syria, 
the United Arab Emirates and 
Bahrain.

LSA senior Naoshin Khan said 

she enjoyed the unifying factor of 
the show.

“It’s nice to see everyone as 

a collective community rather 
than 
being 
dispersed,” 
she 

said. “It’s nice to see everyone 
together.”

cases in 2016. It is estimated that 
about 12 percent of U.S. women 
will develop breast cancer over the 
course of their lifetime.

The theme of the morning 

discussion, titled “How Decisions 
are Made in Breast Cancer 
Treatment,” 
was 
precision 

medicine, in which each individual 
patient’s genetic, environmental 
and 
lifestyle 
variability 
are 

considered in making a decision.

UM CCC Director Theodore 

Lawrence said contrary to popular 
belief, precision medicine can 
focus on the patient to make the 
fight with cancer the best it can be, 
instead of just precision medicine 
focusing mostly on the genetics of 
the tumor.

“I think precision medicine is 

more than just genes,” Lawrence 
said. “It goes all the way from 
understanding 
the 
tumor, 
to 

understanding that tumor within 
the patient, to understanding 
that patient’s social situation, and 
how can we make the individual 
patient’s journey (with breast 
cancer) the best it could possibly 
be.”

During the discussion, panelists 

emphasized 
that 
decisions 

in 
breast 
cancer 
diagnoses 

and treatment are made as a 
multidisciplinary approach, and 
said each step of a decision is 
important for the following step. 
For example, the characteristics of 
a patient’s tumor are important for 
deciding which treatment options 
to pursue.

Lynn Henry, associate professor 

of Internal Medicine, said the 
specific details of the diagnosis, 
such as how big or invasive the 
tumor is, could inform the doctors 
on treatment options.

“For this particular patient 

(for example), because she has a 
large tumor and it’s aggressive, we 
give chemotherapy,” Henry said, 
pointing to a specific case.

Radiation Oncology Professor 

Lori Pierce added that though the 
majority of breast cancer patients 
do not need radiation treatments, 
patients with a risk of recurrence 
— when cancer returns either in 

same or different tissues — are 
recommended to receive it.

“The majority of patients would 

not need radiation because for the 
majority of patients, the tumor 
would be completely removed 
with excellent surgery,” Pierce 
said. “It’s the patients who are 
deemed to be at moderate to high 
risks for having a recurrence … are 
the ones we would recommended 
radiation for.”

Similarly, 
Pathology 
Prof. 

Celina Kleer emphasized that 
everyone’s tumors are biologically 
different, so no single treatment 
works for every patient.

“I showed you a picture of 

one woman’s breast cancer, but 
if I show you a picture of another 
patient’s breast cancer, it looks 
completely different,” Kleer said. 
“Some tumors express different 
proteins 
and 
have 
different 

biological characteristics.” 

UM CCC nurse practitioner 

Kelly Scheu noted the importance 
of individualized patient support 
during and after the treatment, 
citing available supportive care 
available for patients including 
mental health support.

“There’s a lot that goes into 

talking to your patients and trying 
to support them,” Scheu said. 
“Pills can help, but talking is very 
helpful.”

Post-baccalaureate 
student 

Caroline Arellano-Garcia said she 
attended the summit because she 
is familiar with the research, but 
not the treatment aspect of the 
disease.

“I didn’t realize the emotional 

and psychological impact (the 
disease) has on the women,” 
Arellano-Garcia said. Arellano-
Garcia noted that since she is a 
Latina, that information could be 
particularly important to relay to 
her community. Hispanic/Latina 
women are on average diagnosed 
with more advanced breast cancers 
than white women, possibly due to 
lower mammography rates and 
delays 
following-up 
abnormal 

mammograms, according to the 
Susan G. Komen Foundation.

“I feel that in my community, 

there might be a lot of ignorance,” 
Arellano-Garcia said. “I can relay 
the message on the importance of 
knowing about the disease.”

Greden noted that 25 percent of 
University students suffer from 
a mental health condition such 
as depression or anxiety, for 
which only 40 percent receive 
treatment.

Another 
question 
asked 

whether or not panelists believed 
there is a stigma attached to 
being a survivor of sexual assault. 
Milkovich 
responded 
saying 

according 
tocampus 
climate 

data, only 45 percent of students 
tell another person about their 
experience — a statistic she said 
points to “too much silence” on 
campus.

Data was also a topic in 

discussion later in the chat, in 
response to a question on the 
prevalence of sexual misconduct 
on campus. Milkovich responded 
that according to the campus 
climate report, 10 percent of 
students 
experienced 
sexual 

misconduct 
within 
the 
last 

year and 22 percent of female 
undergraduate students report 
sexual violence.

Another 
question 
from 

a 
recent 
graduate 
of 
the 

University, asked: “What are 
your 
recommendations 
for 

recent grads who feel like they 
didn’t live up to their personal 
expectations?”

In response, Greden said 

he 
recommends 
talking 
to 

therapists, friends or seeking 
additional help if symptoms are 
more severe.

the

last 
summer 

shows that they, to some extent, 
haven’t made a big enough effort 
to see the potential of what a 
physical connection between the 
University and the city can have.”

Last year, Consider hosted an 

event regarding education reform 
in Detroit. They had a panel of 
teacher union representatives, 
policy researchers and nonprofits, 
such as Teach for America, 
discuss their work in Detroit. 
After the event, the student 
organization said they wanted to 
extend their work with the city. 

This year, Consider approached 

MUSIC 
Matters 
to 
help 

incorporate a “Detroit Village” 
within SpringFest by bringing 
nonprofits and startups from the 
city of Detroit into a tent in the 
Diag. They said the purpose of 
the setup is to encourage students 
to be more involved with the city 
during college and later seek job 
opportunities there.

Business junior Connor Yee, 

the president of Consider, said the 
purpose of the Detroit Village is 
to make students aware of what 
is really happening in Detroit 
through business and outreach.

“We’re setting up an area 

where 
these 
companies 
can 

interact with students, so that 
students can get a better idea and 
feel for what’s really happening 
in Detroit and how much people 
are really standing behind it,” he 
said. “There’s a lot going on down 
there that people really neglect to 
look at.”

The nonprofits each focus on 

different service areas such as 
transportation, 
neighborhood 

cleanup, youth mentoring and 
food distribution. Among them 
are organizations such as Rebel 
Nell, which promotes women 
in Detroit who create Graffiti 
Jewelry, M-1 Rail, which heads 
the effort to create a 3.3-mile 
streetcar 
along 
Woodward 

Avenue 
and 
Greening 
of 

Detroit, which promotes a more 
environmentally friendly city by 
way of gardening and trees, but 
also encourages food distribution 

and education reform.

Detroit vs. Everybody will also 

be making an appearance to sell 
their apparel and promote the 
city.

Bennett 
said 
since 
most 

students never step foot in the 
city, the University needs to 
encourage them to get involved.

“The majority of students 

who come to this campus go 
most of their time without ever 
going to Detroit,” he said. “We 
don’t market ourselves as the 
University that is 45 minutes 
away from one of the greatest 
culturally diverse and academic 
renowned cities in the country. 
We need to give our students the 
opportunity to engage in Detroit’s 
revitalization.”

SpringFest 
Chair 
Sabrina 

Khan, an Art & Design junior, 
said one of the goals of the event 
this year is to change people’s 
perceptions of the city.

“If you don’t know about 

Detroit, you think of all of the 
negative media. You tend to have 
this stigma and this negative 
perception of Detroit,” she said. 
“We wanted to destigmatize that 
and get people involved with 
going to Detroit because we feel 
that Detroit is our neighbor and 
a lot of people don’t necessarily 
know what it has to offer.”

Another aspect of the event is 

the Art Experience, which is an 
interactive visual and musical 
art exhibit where people can 
participate in art activities.

Khan said she was excited 

that the Art Experience would 
be another way aside from work 
the Detroit-based nonprofits to 
connect with the city.

“The Art Experience is one 

of our philanthropic endeavors 
to engage with students and 
also give back to the Detroit 
community,” she said.

Students will be able to paint 

pianos and backpacks that will 
then be donated to a school in the 
city. They will also be able to paint 
ceiling tiles for a mural that will 
be sent back to the city schools. 
There will also be a chalkboard 
on which students can write why 
they stand by Detroit. The board 
will be put on display around the 
city.

sustainability 
behavior 
and 

engagement 
efforts, 
showed 

slightly more positive results. 
Citing a study by the Sustainability 
Cultural 
Indicators 
Program, 

which measures sustainability 
awareness, 
knowledge 
and 

behavior on campus to inform 
future 
sustainability 
efforts, 

the report said sustainability 
knowledge 
had 
increased 
in 

the past year, but eco-friendly 
engagement had decreased.

The report emphasized the 

success of several engagement 
programs, including the Planet 
Blue 
Ambassador 
Program, 

which facilitates sustainability 
awareness by providing a platform 
for 
“ambassadors” 
to 
make 

pledges relating to their personal 
sustainability and monitor their 
environmental impact. According 
to 
the 
report, 
the 
program 

has created more than 2,400 
ambassadors — meaning they’ve 
completed five training modules 
related to “energy, food, waste, 
water and community — who 
have completed more than 20,000 
“environmental actions” that help 
move toward the University’s 
goals.

Despite the low numbers in 

energy conservation and waste 
reduction, 
Andrew 
Horning, 

deputy director of the Graham 
Sustainability 
Institute 
at 

the University, noted that the 
University was now devoting more 
resources to sustainability after 
a 2015 announcement of a $100 
million dollar investment.

The 
investment, 
aimed 
at 

creating a greener campus, is 
spread out over a number of 
different 
initiatives 
and 
will 

be implemented incrementally 
in 
the 
coming 
years. 
The 

primary focuses of the funds, 
recommended by committees of 
faculty, staff and students, are 
expansion of the University’s 
food waste composting program; 
extension of the University’s 
energy conservation program to 
the University of Michigan Health 
System, the athletic program 
and University Housing; and 
enhancement 
of 
sustainability 

behavior change and engagement 
programs. Most of the programs 
recommended were not fully or at 
all implemented in 2015, the year 

measured by the report.

“These programs and many 

others 
are 
being 
enhanced 

through a new commitment of 
dedicated resources that will allow 
for more effective outreach to and 
engagement with the campus 
community,” Horning said.

Also 
highlighted 
in 
the 

Sustainability Progress Report 
was the University’s recent “gold” 
rating under the Sustainability 
Tracking, Assessment & Rating 
System.

STARS, 
designed 
by 
the 

Association for the Advancement 
of 
Sustainability 
in 
Higher 

Education, was envisioned as a 
way to increase transparency 
in 
measuring 
progress 
in 

sustainability, 
and 
relies 

on 
self-reported 
data 
from 

participating universities. Gold 
is an improvement from the 
University’s previous rating of 
silver, which was given in 2012. 
Platinum is the only higher 
ranking possible under STARS 
after gold, and is currently held 
only by Colorado State University.

Nonetheless, for some students, 

the 
University’s 
sustainability 

initiatives draw a mixed response.

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Ellen 

Loubert, a member of the steering 
committee for the Divest and 
Invest Campaign, said the issue 
isn’t that campus isn’t invested in 
sustainability, but rather that the 
University isn’t listening. Divest 
and Invest advocates for the 
University to divest its endowment 
investments from coal.

“Some of the support really 

shows that there is in fact campus 
consensus on the underlying issue 
in the case of divestment, which 
is climate change,” she said. “So, I 
think the first step in, you know, 
actually 
realizing 
divestment 

would be for the regents of the 
University to form an ad hoc 
committee that could look into 
that.”

Loubert added that she hasn’t 

seen any initiative on the part of 
the University to address these 
complaints.

“We 
could 
understand 
if 

the University had formed this 
committee, but what we’re seeing 
right now is a lack of motivation to 
even start the process of looking 
into that,” she said. “So you see 
how this report is doing a lot of 
good things, but at the same time, 
is sort of hypocritical.”

T

here’s a big difference 
between paying to stream 
music and streaming for 

free.

Calculations 

from 
the 

Recording 
Industry 
Association 
of 

America’s annual 
data report show 
that each paid 
music subscriber 
contributes 
about 
$100 

annually to the 
music 
industry. 

That is 25 times as much as people 
using 
free 
streaming 
services 

supported 
by 
advertisements. 

Each person using those services 
generates around $4 for the music 
industry annually. Unfortunately 
for the music industry, way more 
people stream music for free 
rather than purchase streaming 
subscriptions.

Streaming’s 
takeover 
is 

inevitable, but a free model 
doesn’t seem to work because it 
generates only one-third of the 
revenue of paid subscriptions. On 
top of that, less of the money from 
free ad-supported streaming is 
getting passed along to artists. 
Royalties — what the artists earn 
per stream — differ depending 
on whether it’s a free stream or 
a paid stream. As of December 
2015, free streaming royalties 
paid 23-percent lower rates to 
artists than paid subscriptions. 
So while a majority of users are 
generating a small fraction of 
total streaming revenues, less 
of that fraction is getting passed 
along to the artists.

The industry is struggling to 

grow, but there’s an opportunity 
to change that by converting all 
these millions of free streamers 
into 
paying 
subscribers. 
It 

shouldn’t be a hard sell — pay 
$10 per month and you get access 
to a library of 20 million songs. 
More than fair — I think it’s our 
obligation to the artists to pay. 
There are tens of millions of 
people using Spotify, SoundCloud, 

Pandora and YouTube to stream 
music for free. A lot of money is 
being left on the table and major 
labels need to better monetize 
these platforms. Fortunately, that 
process has begun.

SoundCloud has been working 

for months to finalize licensing 
deals 
with 
Warner, 
Universal 

and Sony — the three parent 
companies 
that 
represent 
the 

majority of music produced in 
the country. After SoundCloud 
finished a licensing deal with 
Sony in March, it immediately 
rolled out a paid-subscription 
service named SoundCloud Go. 
Now, certain tracks will only be 
available to paying SoundCloud 
Go users. For example, a band and 
their label can choose which songs 
to release for free and which songs 
to keep exclusively for premium 
users. The transition toward a paid-
subscription model will help nudge 
SoundCloud’s large user base to 
start paying to stream music.

SoundCloud’s new business 

model 
is 
categorized 
as 

“freemium” 
— 
offering 
both 

free and premium subscription 
service options. It’s the same 
freemium model that Spotify 
uses and, according to their 
recent 
billion-dollar 
funding 

round, it has worked for them 
so far. Spotify has been great 
at converting free users into 
paid users. Their CEO Daniel 
Ek announced the company has 
been adding one million paid 
subscribers per month since last 
June — that’s 10 million new 
paying subscribers in the last nine 
months. Hopefully, SoundCloud 
will yield similar results.

Those paying subscribers are 

needed now more than ever. The 
industry’s 2015 growth is barely 
even growth at all. If streaming 
is going to come to the rescue, 
it’s not going to be just any 
streaming. A small percentage 
of paying subscribers are doing 
a bulk of the work. The current 
model might benefit streaming 
services 
and 
help 
stimulate 

industry-level 
growth. 
We 

should ask, though, does it work 

for artists?

Even 
with 
more 
paying 

subscribers, the current system 
for compensating artists is flawed. 
Do you think it’s fair that your 
monthly 
subscription 
payment 

goes to artists you don’t listen to? 
That’s how the royalty system is 
currently set up. Your subscription 
payment goes into a large pool 
that then pays artists fractions 
of a penny per stream. Instead of 
your money going directly to the 
artists you listen to, some of the 
money is used to pay bigger artists 
generating greater royalties.

A proposed alternative to the 

current system is a “subscriber 
share” method that addresses this 
issue. A subscriber share system 
would pay artists based directly 
on how much users listen to them. 
This would refocus payments from 
a system only concerned with 
the number of listens to a new 
system concerned with accounts 
for percentage of time spent 
listening to the artists. If you only 
listen to one artist this month, 
your subscription payment would 
only be used to pay that artist. 
This proposal would not affect 
the streaming services. It would 
only redistribute royalties among 
artists, from those you aren’t 
streaming to the ones you actually 
are. If compensating artists fairly 
is a concern, maybe this is a better 
way to do so. Otherwise, we are 
perpetuating a music industry 
with massive inequality.

Like our tax system, royalties 

are very complex and systematic 
changes are hard to come by. The 
first step toward a fairer system 
is 
understanding 
the 
current 

one. And the current one is this: 
Most users don’t pay to stream 
music and don’t contribute to 
compensating 
artists. 
Those 

who do pay to stream are being 
taken 
advantage 
of 
and 
the 

artists they listen to are not being 
compensated accordingly. Not all 
streams are created equal, nor are 
they created fairly.

Dear 
University 
Elections 

Commission,

Please do your job.
With another year of Central 

Student 
Government 
elections 

behind us and another set of 
representatives 
and 
executives 

set to be sworn in soon, many 
students on campus want to let 
the memory of CSG elections fade 
to the past. This election cycle, 
like many before, has brought a 
number of candidates, parties 
and campaign promises to the 
Diag. However, unlike in prior 
years, this campaign season has 
brought an onslaught of extreme 
campaigning 
and 
more 
than 

$4,500 in campaign spending 
between the two major parties.

I 
have 
no 
problem 
with 

campaigning for CSG. Chalking 
the Diag in favor of a given 
party is as old of a tradition as 
any. However, I begin to have 
problems when an unending 
assault on my privacy occurs. 
While much of this is unavoidable, 
as candidates are allowed to 
enter residence halls and go 
door to door, the University 
Election 
Code 
specifically 

prevents 
“Irresponsible 
Use 

of Email Privileges.” Article 
6 of the CSG Compiled Code 
specifically prohibits candidates 
from 
“harvesting 
student 

email addresses for campaign 
purposes,” assigning a 3-percent 
vote 
reduction 
per 
recipient, 

per e-mail. With this in mind, I 
became concerned when I started 
receiving e-mails from candidates 
I had no relationship with.

On 
March 
23, 
I 
filed 
a 

complaint with the University 
Election 
Commission 
against 

LSA Representative candidates 
Craig Motola and Seth Schostak, 
who had e-mailed my name as 
part of a potentially harvested 
listserv 
advertising 
their 

campaign. A hearing was held, 
and 
despite 
overwhelming 

evidence to the contrary, both 
Motola and Schostak were found 

not guilty of an election code 
violation, 
a 
violation 
which 

would 
have 
most 
certainly 

disqualified both of them from 
the election.

In response to this injustice, 

I urge the UEC to look to their 
own prior decisions. In the 2015 
case Brenner v. George, the 
commission found CSG candidate 
Stevin George guilty of a code 
violation and disqualified him 
from the election. The offense in 
this case occurred when George 
sent an e-mail to a listserv 
he didn’t own. What makes 
spamming 
a 
private 
listserv 

worse than creating a listserv 
out of nowhere to spam?

Even more laughable about 

the 
UEC’s 
decision 
was 

their 
standard 
of 
evidence 

for 
conviction, 
noting 
they 

would 
be 
“hard-pressed 
to 

think 
of 
any 
conceivable 

circumstance, perhaps short 
of video evidence, in which 
a complainant would be able 
to prove email harvesting.” 
Aside from the unbelievably 
high standard of evidence that 
comes with demanding video 
proof of criminal activity, the 
UEC’s decision is extremely 
contrary to their own prior 
findings. There was no video 
evidence present in the ejection 
of Stevin George, nor was 
there in the 2015 case Email 
Harvesting, in which the UEC 
established 
a 
three-pronged 

test to determine if harvesting 
had occurred.

Why have rules if there is no 

reason to follow them?

In the majority opinion, delivered 

by election commissioners Mallory 
Andrews and Emily Rosenthal, 
the commission agreed that 823 
people had been e-mailed by Craig 
Motola, and that 455 people had 
been e-mailed twice by Seth 
Schostak. Despite eight victims 
coming forward, all swearing they 
had no affiliation with the listserv, 
the UEC still suggested harvesting 

had not occurred, suggesting it 
had been “a prank” or “a simple, 
innocent typo.”

This type of treatment from the 

body slated to protect the students 
from out-of-control campaigning 
is unacceptable. By letting people 
the commission even admitted 
had “probably harvested emails” 
off the hook, the commission 
opens the door for unlimited 
spamming of innocent students. 
As 
dissenting 
commissioner 

Dylan Bennett reported: “We 
will now have representatives 
on our student assembly who 
the entirety of this Commission 
believes have likely cheated the 
democratic process.”

Cheating the democratic process 

is not something I’m looking for 
in a CSG representative. With a 
budget of more than $450,000, I 
need to know that those in control 
are capable of being trusted. 
Having every commissioner of 
the UEC think that two LSA 
representatives “probably” broke 
a basic rule destroys that trust. 
Ignoring the election code isn’t 
something I’m looking for in CSG 
either, as the UEC is responsible 
to 
enforce 
the 
code 
on 
the 

candidates. Without having full 
faith that those who won the 
election did so honestly and can be 
trusted to make decisions on the 
student body’s behalf, the $7.19 
that every Michigan student pays 
in CSG taxes may have been better 
off saved.

Though 
the 
decision 
in 

Pearlman v. Motola et. al has 
been made, I hope future CSG 
candidates 
are 
more 
honest 

regarding 
the 
election 
code 

and choose to follow the rules, 
even if they can get away with 
breaking them. I also call on the 
UEC to stop the harvesting of 
e-mails for campaigning during 
election season, even if it means 
ejecting candidates.

I

magine if Michael Jordan in his prime 
said basketball was boring. It would be 
sadder than the frequency with which 

we use the crying Jordan 
meme. 
Washington 

Nationals 
star 
Bryce 

Harper — arguably one of 
the top two young players 
in 
the 
game 
— 
said 

baseball is tired. Last 
week, he sported a hat 
that read, “Make Baseball 
Fun Again.”

I know from playing 

baseball for more than a 
decade of my life that it 
can be really fun or really 
boring. Making a diving catch in the outfield 
attempting to impress the softball team? Fun. 
Taking down stats and tracking the pitch 
count on the bench while eating a Subway 
sandwich with chips on it in 40-degree 
weather? Not fun.

As for Major League 

Baseball, 
the 
reason 
it 

isn’t fun is because there 
are unwritten rules that 
are too uptight. Not all of 
these rules are bad — my 
particular favorite is giving 
the opposing team a taste 
of its own medicine. If the 
opposing pitcher sends a 
mid-90s fastball to your 
teammate’s 
dome, 
you 

as a pitcher are basically 
contractually obligated to do the same thing 
in the next half inning. It’s like an honor 
code. If the benches clear, bonus. If you throw 
down the batter who charges at you like a 
sack of potatoes, even better. Here’s to you, 
Rick Porcello.

But the one unwritten rule I find 

incredibly stupid is that bat flips are a no-no. 
For those of you who don’t know, a bat flip is 
when the batter obliterates a ball over the 
wall with no doubt, and instead of setting 
the bat down like a gentleman, they toss the 
bat in the air as to say, “Won’t be needing 
this anymore.” If you haven’t seen it before, 
it’s majestic. The Toronto Blue Jays’ Jose 
Bautista did it so beautifully in the playoffs 
last season that a fan had the scene tattooed 
on his leg. I get goosebumps when I watch 
the replay as popcorn rains down from the 
upper deck of Rogers Centre.

However, players in Korea make bat flips an 

art form. Choi Jun-seok even did one off of a 
foul ball. You’re not supposed to do that, but 
more props to him. If that happened in the 
MLB, benches would no doubt clear, because, 
of course, it’s in the unwritten rules. The Fake 
Unwritten Rules Of Baseball, section eight, 
article seven: No bat flips, and if you flip your 
bat on a foul ball, Babe Ruth will haunt your 
dreams for eternity.

The problem with baseball purists — 

which include former and current MLB 
players and fans — is that hating bat flips 
is more about hating personality. Baseball 
purists want every player to act the same: to 
shut their mouths, hold onto their bats and 
not showboat. But some of the most beloved 
players were different from the norm. Ozzie 

Smith did backflips in the ‘80s. Ty Cobb put 
fear into middle infielders in the first two 
decades of the 20th century by sharpening 
his spikes. Prince Fielder will eat a fan’s 
nachos and Justin Verlander used to eat 
Taco Bell before every game. Those are 
accepted behaviors — well, except for Ty 
Cobb’s sharpening spikes (his opponents, as 
well as their fans, hated that).

But why do we hate when a player just 

wants to be himself? Let Ty Cobb be Ty Cobb. 
There shouldn’t be any griping when Yasiel 
Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers wants to 
catch a fly ball behind his back or does a bat 
flip. Who are fans and opposing players to 
say what an individual should or shouldn’t 
do in a sport that needs flair because it’s so 
long and can be boring at times? Different 
is what makes baseball cool. Baseball is the 
best sport when its quirkiness from its fans 
and players come alive. There needs to be 
more things like fans trolling Hunter Pence 

with signs like, “Hunter 
Pence wears socks with 
sandals,” or how I noticed 
the 
Oakland 
A’s 
made 

the 
Oakland 
Coliseum 

the rowdiest and most 
rambunctious 
stadium 

come playoff time. The 
drums and noise makers 
were 
never 
enough 
to 

beat my Tigers every year, 
though.

Baseball needs crazy. It 

thrives off it. Fans love it. 

Like no other sport, it drives millionaires 
off their rocker to throw temper tantrums 
like little leaguers. ’Roid rage is a different 
story. Steroids have no place in the game. 
Though they led to more home runs, which 
lead to a higher probability of bat flips, it’s 
cheating, no matter how impressive the 
amount of work the players put in is.

Baseball is at its best and more fun 

when the players are free to be themselves. 
Baseball 
needs 
weirdos, 
outcasts 
and 

villains. It needs players who are way too 
cocky for their own good and will not be shy 
to tell you that.

Baseball needs the charm it had while 

I was playing baseball in high school. We 
clotheslined each other off walk-off hits, 
danced in the dugout while we mixed 
Gatorade and called it Slow Motion Potion. 
We despised kids on certain teams, my best 
friend threw knuckleballs in games for the 
hell of it, and we even got in yelling fights 
with opponents where benches cleared.

As Bryce Harper who at 23 years old is 

a kid in the game, wants, the MLB needs 
to play the sport like they are kids again. 
Baseball is not adult, it’s not perfect and 
it’s not vanilla normal. It’s a game when 
it’s being treated more like a business.

How will we make baseball fun again? 

We will build a wall keeping the purists 
out. How are we going to fund it? They 
will pay for it. I can’t explain how, but 
they’re going to, and I’m going to make 
sure of it.

‘O.J.’ nails it on finale

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

What a season it has been. 

“The Verdict,” the miniseries 
finale of “American Crime Story: 
The People v. 
O.J. 
Simpson,” 

wrapped up an 
outstanding 10 
episodes 
that 

covered almost 
every 
signifi-

cant detail of the 
1994 O.J. Simp-
son trial, from 
the 
invasive 

media 
cover-

age to the tense 
atmosphere surrounding current 
racial 
politics. 
Dramatizations 

and small inaccuracies aside, Ryan 
Murphy and Co. have built a mas-
terful depiction of one of the most 
infamous cases of the 20th cen-
tury. What’s even more impressive 
is how the show transformed “The 
Verdict” into a stellar, breathtak-
ing ending, even when we already 
knew what the outcome was going 
to be.

Other than the actual verdict 

itself, the finale touches on sev-
eral important aspects regard-
ing the trial, particularly with the 
closing statements of prosecution 
duo Marcia Clark (Sarah Paulson, 
“Carol”) and Christopher Darden 
(Sterling K. Brown, “Supernatu-
ral”) and defense attorney Johnnie 
Cochran (Courtney B. Vance, “Joy-
ful Noise”). Considering how all 
three lawyers were able to develop 
compelling points for and against 
O.J. Simpson, it’s amazing to see 
how their arguments make the 
case even more complex. Addition-
ally, it provides another showcase 
for Paulson, Brown and Vance’s 
consistently outstanding perfor-
mances.

After the statements are fin-

ished, the remaining jury members 
are left to determine O.J.’s fate. 
The sequence of the trial’s ulti-
mate decision between the jury 
is telling of what the case is also 
really about: race. Following the 
horrific Rodney King beating and 
the subsequent 1992 L.A. riots, the 
O.J. trial divided both Black and 
white americans. In terms of the 
actual decision, this racial divide 
reigned true as well: the Black 
jury members all believe O.J. is 
innocent, while the two remaining 
white members think he is guilty. 
Whether or not this was actu-
ally what happened, it’s still very 
unnerving to watch. However, 
with only four hours until final-
izing their decision, this is where 
things get interesting.

The titular climax of “The Ver-

dict” encompasses pretty much 
every reaction possible before, 
during and after O.J. is found not 
guilty for the murders of Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. 
Thanks to some fantastic editing 
and clever use of archival footage, 
a split-screen displays the polar-
ized response from the lawyers, 
the courtroom audience and those 
watching on TV screens around 
the country. The Black community 
is shown as relieved and cheer-
ing in the streets, while the white 
community is in total disbelief and 
shock. Though the verdict didn’t 
incite a resurgence of the ‘92 riots, 
there’s no doubt that the trial left 
some residues of tension among 
Americans.

Once the dust settles, “The 

People v. O.J. Simpson” captures 
some of the final glimpses of its 
characters, strengthened espe-
cially by the tremendous effort 
from Murphy’s direction and Scott 
Alexander and Larry Karasze-
wski’s writing. First, Darden and 

Cochran share a passive aggres-
sive exchange about the distortion 
of the truth behind the case and 
its lasting effect. Cochran believes 
Americans are finally recogniz-
ing Black civil rights, but Darden 
counters him, saying that “police 
in this country will keep arresting 
us, keep beating us, keep killing us” 
and tells him straightforwardly 
that Cochran hasn’t “changed 
anything for Black people here.” 
This, of course, is a sobering truth 
that continues to resonate today 
with police brutality against Black 
people in America. Later, Darden 
meets up with Clark and the two 
discuss their frustrations with not 
bringing justice to Nicole and Ron. 
But even in their disappointment, 
they still have each other.

Then comes O.J. (Cuba Good-

ing Jr., “Jerry Maguire”), relishing 
in his freedom but realizing that 
things are different now. He’s no 
longer “The Juice” that every foot-
ball fan loved; he’s still in shackles. 
The final seconds of “The Verdict” 
concludes with a haunting image 
of O.J. walking alone in his back-
yard and hopelessly gazing at the 
marble statue of himself, knowing 
that his reputation will be forever 
tarnished by this murder, regard-
less of his race, fame or fortune. 
Coupled with Bill Withers’s “Ain’t 
No Sunshine” scoring an epilogue 
montage of each character, “The 
People v. O.J. Simpson” finishes 
on a rather devastating, eerie note: 
pictures of a smiling Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ron Goldman, igno-
rant to how their deaths will be 
taken in vain.

The O.J. verdict may not have 

brought justice, but “American 
Crime Story” shined a light on 
something in modern history 
that still matters today. And I’ll 
be damned if it doesn’t sweep the 
Emmys.

From ‘Snow Dogs’ to ‘O.J.’

‘Some’ stars talk

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

Last Thursday, I got the chance 

to sit down with Glen Powell, 
Wyatt Russell and Quinton John-
son, the stars of “Everybody Wants 
Some!!” the latest ode to youth 
from Texas filmmaker Richard 
Linklater (“Boyhood”).

The film has been billed as a 

“spiritual sequel” to Linklater’s 
1993 cult classic “Dazed and 
Confused,” but there wasn’t any 
pressure for “Everybody Wants 
Some!!” to live up to its big brother.

“If you try to be Matthew 

McConaughey or Ben Affleck or 
Parker Posey … then you’re setting 
yourself up for failure,” Powell, 
who plays Finn, a veteran player 
who takes the awkward freshman 
under his wing said.

Russell, who plays senior trans-

fer student Willoughby, added that 
“almost everything is a spiritual 
successor to everything [Linklat-
er] does. When you go back and 
you watch all his movies there’s 
a through line in them that’s his 
mind.”

Much like “Dazed” however, 

many of the actors in “Everybody 
Wants Some!!” were behind the 
camera for the first time. Johnson, 
who plays eager freshman Dale, 
was studying musical theater at 
the University of Texas when he 
got cast in the film. It was his first 
project outside of student films, but 
it won’t be his last.

“When you work with someone 

like Richard Linklater and when 
he takes notice of you, other people 
notice that notice,” he said.

Johnson plans on taking that 

momentum and running with it, 
whether that means more films or 
going back to the stage.

“If I could be in ‘Hamilton’ for 

the next 40 years I would do it,” he 
said.

The boys bickered back and 

forth for a minute about Johnson’s 
passion for “Hamilton,” showing 
me a Snapchat video of Johnson 
performing “Guns & Ships” from 
the musical much to the dismay of 
his castmates. As they tease and 
joke with each other, they fall into 
a rhythm similar to that of their 
characters.

“Everybody had about five 

percent of who they were in their 
character,” Russell said. “But we’re 
actors. Sometimes people forget 
that tapping into that part of your 
personality is something that is 
important for the character.”

The cast had much of the same 

chemistry on and off screen, due in 
large part to extended time spent 
in rehearsals at Linklater’s ranch.

“Most of the time you’re film-

ing, people are meeting on day one. 
Rehearsal is such a luxury,” Powell 
said.

During rehearsals, the cast 

played baseball, read scripts, went 
to dance lessons and, of course, re-
watched “Dazed and Confused.” 
Powell noted that the time spent 
together before shooting “allowed 
for a lot of collaboration and a lot of 
trust.”

Despite 
the 
unprecedented 

comradery and the abundance of 
party scenes in the film, the actors 
weren’t drinking as much Lone 
Star as their characters.

“You can’t get wasted and go do 

a scene. It doesn’t work,” Russell 
said.

“I mean this is a job, we’re doing 

a job,” Johnson added. “But, when 
you get this kind of comradery 
together and you get someone like 
Richard Linklater … it’s nothing 
but fun.”

Despite the decades of separa-

tion, the college experience of the 
film felt very authentic to Powell.

“The more things change, the 

more they stay the same,” he said 
with a laugh.

The three said a lot of that 

authenticity can be attributed to 
collaboration between Linklater 
and the cast on scenes like a party 
at the baseball house.

“Rick (on the party stuff) really 

let us collaborate,” Powell said. 
“He was like OK … what were your 
favorite memories of college, what 
did you do in college, what did he 
do in college … and you start to real-
ize that nothing’s really changed.”

They are glad some things have 

changed, however.

“You don’t see dudes wearing 

short shorts anymore,” Johnson 
said.

“Don’t bring that back. Nobody 

wants that,” Russell said. The boys 
all laughed in agreement.

But for them, the short shorts 

and mustaches aren’t really the 
takeaway from this movie.

“In college … there are paths 

that are open to you, and who are 
you going to become,” Powell said. 
“That’s the nature of being in col-
lege, you kind of think you know 
who you are, but you really don’t.”

“I think mistakes are the 

essence of life, you know,” he con-
tinued, a mantra that seems to ring 
especially true for this film. “A lot 
of the best things you see in this 
movie are outright mistakes.”

However, he also had a note of 

caution — make mistakes but put 
down your phone.

“In college, with these phones, 

mistakes aren’t really forgivable,” 
he said.

And Russell’s parting advice for 

college students, “No nudes, no 
nudes.”

Alright, alright, alright.

company at the University, was 
celebrating their 15th year of film-
making with a festival showcasing 
12 original short films.

M-agination prides itself on 

being one of the most open film 
groups on campus — they’ll consid-
er any project and people from any 
major, not solely English or Screen 
Arts and Cultures. The myriad of 
genres represented in the festival 
illustrated this academic diversity, 
as the films ranged from sketch 
comedy to dance-based footage.

Some filmmakers used the short 

film format to experiment with 
less conventional technical ele-
ments, while others were more 
interested in achieving a narrative 
arc in a short span of time. Notably, 
a film directed by LSA sophomore 
Gabriel Wolfe titled “Corridor” 
was shot as one long take, using 
sound to carry its single character 
through time and space.

The use of silence was a com-

mon trend among the more tra-
ditionally narrative films. Films 
like “Bass” or “After” used edit-
ing rather than dialogue to tell 
their stories. “After” follows the 
relationship between two women 
from when they first start dating 
to their breakup, without having 
the characters speak to each other 
once.

LSA 
sophomore 
Jennifer 

Emery, a Screen Arts and Cultures 
major and an associate producer 
at M-agination, helped choose the 
scripts to be produced the semes-
ter. But Emery also got the chance 
to work on some of the projects 
herself.

Emery particularly enjoyed the 

short she worked on, called “Mid-
night Snack,” also directed by 
Wolfe.

“Midnight Snack … was a really 

cool concept,” Emery said. “It was 
all shot from inside a fridge. It was 
great seeing the audience’s reac-
tions.”

Another one of the stand-out 

films, “February 14th, 1992,” truly 
exhibited the distinctive nature 

of the festival. The senior thesis 
project of director and LSA senior 
Joe Biglin, the experimental film 
flashed quickly through time 
and space without concern for 
traditional narrative or continu-
ity. It felt vaguely like a film you’d 
watch in a theory class, with obvi-
ous cultural value and messages 
that feel clear but also sometimes 
totally out of intellectual reach. 
It jumped through stretches of 
the life of a college-aged man in 
seconds, intriguing us with small 
tastes of the film’s strong and bit-
tersweet emotions. The shortened 
teaser shown at M-agination was 
just part of the larger film that will 
be shown at The Michigan The-
ater April 19th as part of the U-M 
Screen Arts and Cultures student 
thesis screening.

LSA sophomore Fahim Rah-

man, also an M-agination associ-
ate producer, felt that “February 
14th, 1992” achieved the complex-
ity in nature that it set out to do.

“I loved Joe Biglin’s piece,” Rah-

man said. “I heard other people 
saying that it was experimental 
film that was actually enjoyable.”

The last project shown was 

“Interns,” a hilarious group of 
sketches revolving around several 
college kids at an unpaid intern-
ship at a production company. In 
its dynamic and absurd humor, 
“Interns” felt like a younger, more 
hopeful “Workaholics.” At 18 min-
utes, it was by far the longest proj-
ect, but it seemed to speed by at an 
entertaining pace that some of the 
three- to five-minute films could 
not match.

“I think ‘Interns’ was the most 

recognizable to audiences,” Rah-
man said, referencing other office-
based 
mockumentary 
shows 

and webseries. “The Office” and 
“Workaholics” have a similar 
energy, but “Interns” distinguish-
es itself through the well-written 
intrigue brought by its characters.

When the last film finished, the 

filmmakers, clearly distinguished 
by their formal attire and lack of 
snow-filled backpacks, gathered 
to received highly deserved con-
gratulations. The difficulty of bal-
ancing student life with an attempt 
to make a film to show at The 
Michigan Theater is a stressful, 
but beautiful and rare opportunity. 
Rahman said the uniqueness of the 
club’s flexible structure is what 
lends to its allure.

“You pick the (films) you want 

to work on, and then you see them 
on the big screen, The Michigan 
Theater,” Rahman said. “Seeing 
them in a theater is pretty special 
if you’re a student.”

Songs for summer 

These aren’t songs that will 

directly help you get an internship 
or figure out what your true passion 
is. Conversely, I hope this list still 
has value even if you already know 
yourself and what you’re going to 
be doing when school takes a break. 
But as the end of the semester 

comes and shit gets (more) stressful 
and the unknown quantity of these 
next four months looms large in my 
life, I’m just taking stock of some 
songs that I really enjoy.

1. “Work From Home” by 

Fifth Harmony ft. Ty Dolla $ign

Don’t have a job lined up yet? 

There’s more than one way to work. 
As Fifth Harmony proves in this 
song, you can always go to work 
even if you’re not in an office. And 
they make putting in hours at home 
sound way more appealing.

In all honesty, though, this is the 

kind of song that holds me hostage. 

Just writing these few sentences 
right now has required a Herculean 
effort on my part (you’re welcome). 
This beat just opens up a vacuum 
in my brain and eliminates all 
thoughts 
(including 
how to spell 
“vacuum”). 
That’s 
not 

always a bad 
feeling, and 
“Work From 
Home” is a 
nice way to 
kill 
three 

minutes.

But really, 

I just wanted an excuse to make 
you watch the “Work From Home” 
video, which serves as undeniable 
proof that the next “Magic Mike” 
needs a construction site setpiece. 
(Also, how the hell was this director 
able to sexualize cement?)

2. “The Knock” by Hop Along
I feel like I’ve been drowning in 

new music lately. I’ve been chasing 
every offhand recommendation on 
Twitter, obsessively exploring any 
band that gets interviewed by a 
writer I like and trying really hard 
to actually listen to songs when my 
friends tell me “you should listen to 
this song.” I have musical FOMO, 
and it’s a problem.

But Hop Along has been a 

brilliant reward for this slight 
insanity. 
The 
band’s 
Painted 

Shut, which came out in 2015, 
is one of the best rock records 
I’ve heard in the last few years 
— this really thoughtful brand 
of punk punctuated by the gruff 
yet breathlessly pretty vocals of 
Francis Quinlan. Maybe picking 
the opening track as the best feels 
like a cop-out, but the lyrics are 
hypnotically inscrutable and even 
though it doesn’t even have a chorus 
there’s a secret catchiness in the 
chaos. “The Knock” is a song that 
motivates me to keep searching for 
more, to look up all the unfamiliar 
band names I see each day. Hustle 
gets results.

3. “These Days” by Drake
In what’s probably the first ever 

intersection of Drake and Wes 
Anderson, this Drizzy cover of a 
track you probably best know from 
“The Royal Tenenbaums” hit the 
Internet a couple weeks ago. It’s 
weird, and it’s not especially great. 
Drake competently handles himself 
on the verses, but his straining voice 
when he tries to sing the title phrase 
feels awkward and out of place. It’s 
hard to fault the singer of a Nico 
song for having a bad voice, because 
Nico herself usually sounded like 
she was singing from bed with a 
major cold and giant headphones 
playing a different song in her ears, 
but her ugly German vocals owned 
this song.

When the Drake cover came 

out, I also made the unfortunate 

discovery that Nico was maybe kind 
of a Nazi according to Wikipedia. 
This sucks for me, if I’m allowed to 
make someone’s hardcore racism 
about myself for a minute, because 
“These Days” was a revelation for 
me when I first heard it. Jackson 
Browne’s expert guitar picking and 
Nico’s terrible, bitter-trying-to-be-
sweet voice somehow combined 
to make a stunningly beautiful 
track unlike anything I’ve ever 
heard since. I listened to it over 
and over again when I was like 15, 
to the point where I almost became 
depressed that I’d never hear 
another track that hit me for the 
first time in the same way “These 
Days” did (I’ve been proven false on 
that point multiple times since).

I like, then, that Drake’s version 

carries the torch of “These Days” 
while also being kind of a middle 
finger to an artist who once to 
quote 
Wikipedia, 
“attacked 
a 

mixed-race woman in a restaurant 
with a smashed wineglass, saying 
‘I hate black people.’” I like how 
unexpected it was, that it was this 
risky music that surprised me, and 
that it twists the legacy of Nico 
and this song into something more 
playful and loose. I’d pay good 
money to hear him do Bridgette 
Bardot.

4. “Come On a Cone” by Nicki 

Minaj

I sometimes wonder if I listen 

to too much music. I’m almost 
never not putting songs in my ears, 
whether it’s earbuds when I walk 
to class or blasting songs out of the 
speakers of The Michigan Daily 
Arts computer or even putting 
on jazz when I need to read in 
concentrate. The amount of silence 
in my life is practically zero.

Sometimes, then, I worry that all 

the music I listen to just blurs into 
one big hulk of noise, like this single 
static note that I can’t appreciate 
because I’ve forgotten what life is 
like without it.

But then I hear something like 

the unapologetic mania of Nicki 
Minaj’s “Come On a Cone” and I 
get so excited because I know that 
no matter how many times I hear 
it, I will always be equal parts 
perplexed and thrilled by how a 
world-famous pop star was able to 
put this song together.

With a beat set in what sounds 

like an ’80s space arcade game, 
Minaj roleplays a whole soap 
opera’s worth of characters, from 
the angry rapper doing the verses 
to the hysterical voice repeating 
the title phrase to the aspiring 
American Idol contestant belting 
“dick in your face!” like it’s “God 
Bless America.” No matter how 
weird and abrasive future music 
gets, nobody will ever be able to sit 
and listen and just calmly accept 
this song, and it makes me crack up 
and smile every time.

5. “Please Do Not Go” by 

Violent Femmes

I have no idea how the Violent 

Femmes happened. Their self-
titled debut is one of the most 
underrated records of the ’80s, and 
while everybody knows “Blister in 
the Sun,” there’s a whole spectrum 
of emotion and experience on just 
these ten songs.

The most fascinating part of 

this record is how “Please Do Not 
Go” and “Add It Up” sit right next 
to each other on the track list. You 
might know “Add It Up” if you’ve 
seen “Reality Bites” — it’s the song 
Ethan Hawke sings that’s like, 
“Why can’t I get just one kiss? Why 
can’t I get just one screw,” et cetera.

That song is obviously a lot 

over overly aggressive nonsense, 
but it works so well because it’s 
preceded by its ultimate contrast 
in “Please Do Not Go.” One of the 
most sensitive and vulnerable 
songs you’ll ever hear, “Please Do 
Not Go,” is singer Graham Gano 
begging at the doorstep of this girl 
he loves, sounding way too drunk 
with the way his voice warbles and 
cracks. Somehow, these folk-punk 
malcontents find a way to break 
your heart on this track, but “Please 
Do Not Go” is especially incredible 
because it’s just one part of what 
feels like a single record’s attempt 
to capture every emotion of the 
human experience. It also has a 
killer bass solo.

6. “Beauty School Dropout” 

by Frankie Avalon

I just love how in “Grease” 

they decide to stop the whole 
storyline for four minutes and let 
this Frankie Avalon hallucination 
steal the entire show. And don’t 
be misguided: “Beauty School 
Dropout” is the best song in 
“Grease,” neither overly cheesy nor 
rape-y nor lacking actual words 
like its most popular numbers. 
Hilarious and wonderfully sung, 
Avalon is simultaneously fatherly, 
cool and heavenly, which is a 
combination I think only John 
Legend has pulled off since.

Can anyone confirm if pink-

haired Frenchy actually goes back 
to high school after hearing this 
song? I can’t figure it out. If I was 
alone at Hunter House and Aaron 
Carter showed up to give me catchy 
advice, I’d probably just go home 
and never tell a soul what I saw. 
But then again, I never flunked 
shampoo.

Anyway, this song is a classic, and 

it just narrowly beats out Andrew 
Rannells doing the ridiculous 
conviction of “I Believe” in “The 
Book of Mormon” as the musical 
song that inexplicably inspires me 
in this moment.

Confused about what these 

songs have to do with summer? 

Look out for part two, same time 

next week. In the meantime, email

How DC Comics TV 
outshines DC movies

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

When “Batman v. Superman” 

opened to $166 million, Warner 
Bros. was celebrating. No matter 
what the critics said, their movie 
was a hit. It was making them boat-
loads of money which would allow 
them to call the movie a win, ignor-
ing the B CinemaScore. And then 
the next weekend happened. The 
film dropped 69 percent from its 
first week to its second, the worst 
for a superhero movie since “Hulk” 
in 2003. While the movie will likely 
make a good amount of money, 
it might not reach the $1 billion 
threshold WB was hoping for.

There’s many lessons DC Films 

and Warner Bros. can learn from 
the experience, and to learn them 
they can turn to the television uni-
verse. DC TV series are outshining 
the films in pretty much every way 
right now.

One of the most important les-

sons, which might seem simple at 
first, is to have your character’s 
motivations be clear and meaning-
ful. It sounds like something from 
Screenwriting 101, but it makes a 
huge impact if it’s not there. “Bat-
man v. Superman” manipulates its 
characters into the titular fight and 
portrays Lois Lane (Amy Adams, 
“Enchanted”) making stupid deci-
sions (remember the spear and 
the fountain, anyone?) based on 
what the plot needs them to do. 
In contrast, “The Flash” based its 
entire first season on the inter-

play between a villain and hero, 
giving Barry Allen (Grant Gustin, 
“Glee”) a reason to fight Harrison 
Wells (Tom Cavanagh, “Scrubs”). It 
makes the payoff that much stron-
ger when you drive a conflict based 
on character instead of plot.

The DC TV universe isn’t afraid 

to go to dark places, but that doesn’t 
mean there needs to be an over-
bearing feeling of dread overpow-
ering everything else in the movie. 
Both “Arrow” and “The Flash” push 
their titular heroes into dark places 
where they feel the weight of the 
world on their shoulders. (“Arrow” 
has been especially guilty of this, 
but the show tends to recover when 
it becomes overbearing.) Yet, they 
never let this sense of darkness 
overwhelm the overall tone of the 
characters. On “The Flash,” there’s 
always someone to bring Barry 
back, and make him know that he’s 
not alone. Jesse L. Martin (“Rent”) 
as Barry’s surrogate father, Joe 
West, is especially good at bring-
ing pathos to the darkness, some-
thing “Batman v. Superman” sorely 
lacked.

Still, “The Flash” ’s crossover 

episode with “Supergirl” should be 
the model for what’s possible when 
you mash up DC characters. While 
The Flash is a natural fit in the 
light (and slightly cheesy) tone of 
“Supergirl,” the hour still integrat-
ed Gustin well. It was genuinely fun 
to see the two heroes fight off some 
villains and then race at the end. 
While I understand the DC Film 
universe wants to match the tone of 

the “Dark Knight” series, “World’s 
Finest” gives them a template for 
what they can do if they just lighten 
up.

In addition, while the legwork 

“The Flash” and “Arrow” did to 
introduce new characters for 
“Legends of Tomorrow” is not 
a perfect template, it was surely 
better than anything “Batman v. 
Superman” did to set up the DC 
cinematic universe. When “The 
Flash” and “Arrow” did their 
crossover episode this season, 
bringing together Hawkman (Falk 
Hentschel, “Transcendence”) and 
Hawkgirl (Ciara Renee, Broad-
way’s “Pippin”), they layered in 
the exposition with the ongo-
ing story by introducing Renee’s 
character early and integrating 
her into “The Flash” ’s ongoing 
arc. Though films don’t have the 
advantage of having weekly con-
tent to work with, “Batman v. 
Superman” decided to pause the 
movie for a few minutes while 
Wonder 
Woman 
(Gal 
Gadot, 

“Furious 6”) looked at sneak pre-
views of upcoming movies. There 
has to be a better way of integrat-
ing these previews by introducing 
new characters for the new story.

In the end, “Batman v. Super-

man” serves as a launching pad 
for a massive franchise of films, 
whether we like it or not. Still, 
though, there are lessons director 
Zack Snyder (“Sucker Punch”) and 
the rest of the drivers of the uni-
verse could learn, and TV is a good 
place for them to start.

Gophers overwhelm 
‘M’ in Friday twin 
bill; weather cancels 

Sunday’s finale

By ETHAN WOLFE

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan baseball team 

suffered both its first home 
losses and its first Big Ten losses 
of the season Friday afternoon 
against Minnesota.

After shutting out Bowling 

Green 
on 
Wednesday, 
the 

17th-ranked Wolverines (3-2 Big 
Ten, 21-8 overall) struggled to 
get going on offense and keep 
the Golden Gophers off the base 
paths, losing both games, 8-1 and 
5-3, respectively.

“We’ve definitely got some 

things we’ve got to work on,” 
said senior left-handed pitcher 
Evan Hill. “You’ve got to put 
these losses behind you as 
fast as possible. After the first 

game, we didn’t do a good job of 
forgetting. We have to be able to 
erase that from our memory as 
fast as possible.”

Game 
one 
of 
Friday’s 

doubleheader 
started 
as 
a 

pitchers’ 
duel 
through 
six 

innings, 
until 
Minnesota’s 

offense heated up in the seventh 
to run away with the victory. 
Though the margin of victory 
was sizable for the Golden 
Gophers (4-1, 18-10), they tied 
the Wolverines with 11 hits.

Michigan 
sophomore 
left-

hander 
Oliver 
Jaskie, 
who 

entered the game with a 2.60 
earned-run average, continued 
to pitch well despite picking up 
the loss. He tossed 4.1 innings, 
allowing two runs off of five hits.

The Golden Gophers’ only 

offense off of Jaskie came in 
the second inning. Left fielder 
Jordan Smith cracked a single to 
right field to score a run, and first 
baseman Toby Hanson followed 
suit in the next at-bat to put 
Minnesota up, 2-0.

Freshman southpaw William 

Tribucher relieved Jaskie in the 
fifth inning to pitch two innings 
and shake off his forgettable 
start on Tuesday against Notre 
Dame. The only run Tribucher 
gave up was from a base runner 
that junior righty Mac Lozer 
inherited in the seventh inning.

Lozer couldn’t escape the 

inning 
without 
additional 

damage though. With the bases 
loaded, a sacrifice fly and a 
single extended the Golden 
Gophers’ lead to 5-1.

With the help of two errors, 

Minnesota 
scored 
three 

insurance runs in the ninth 
inning to add to its cushion.

“We had a very disappointing 

day,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “Minnesota is a good 
team, but there were a lot of 
breakdowns fundamentally. We 
had some uncompetitive at-bats 
and issued too many free passes.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
batting 

order struggled to find a rhythm 
throughout game one. Their lone 
run came in the third inning.

In ‘The Slaughterhouse,’ tennis is a team sport
A

dam Steinberg doesn’t 
remember the first 
time he heard Bo 

Schembechler’s “The Team” 
speech, but 
it was during 
his initial visit 
to campus 
in 2014, 
when he was 
interviewing 
to become the 
new Michigan 
men’s tennis 
coach. Over 
his first 23 
years of coaching college tennis, 
Steinberg had worked to establish 
a mindset that Schembechler’s 
speech embodied.

“It’s perfect,” Steinberg said. 

“When I heard that speech, I 
was like, ‘Wow, this is it. This is 
the place.’ ”

So just before noon last Sunday 

at the Varsity Tennis Center, 
Schembechler’s words began to 
play over the loudspeaker.

No man is more important 

than the team. No coach is more 
important than the team. The 
team, the team, the team. … 
Everything that you do, you take 
into consideration: What effect 
does it have on my team?

When we play as a team, when 

the old season is over, you and 
I know, it’s gonna be Michigan 
again. Michigan.

After Schembechler’s speech, 

the Michigan men’s tennis players 
gathered for a loud, rambunctious 
huddle. Then, they went out and 
defeated Purdue, improving to 12-0 
this season while playing at home.

In less than two years, 

Steinberg has used his unique 
philosophy to change the 
trajectory of the program. Former 
coach Bruce Berque was fired 
in 2014 after failing to advance 
past the second round of the 
NCAA Tournament. Last season, 
Steinberg’s changes took a while 
to kick in as Michigan finished 
7-17, its worst season since 1991-

92. This year, the 21st-ranked 
Wolverines (5-1 Big Ten, 16-4 
overall) are on pace for their best 
season since 1987-88.

Lots of coaches say that when 

they start at a program, they want 
to change the culture. Steinberg’s 
change, one that has put together 
one of the biggest turnarounds 
in the country, is a broad one: As 
he puts it, he wanted to change 
“everything this program is about.”

“I have a different concept, that 

we’re going to take an individual 
sport and make it a team,” 
Steinberg said. “Your first priority 
as a Michigan tennis player is 
to make your teammates better. 
That’s something that’s another 
language for a tennis player — 
‘What do you mean, I have to 
think about somebody else?’ ”

It’s not their fault, Steinberg 

says. In junior tennis, team events 
are rare. You play your game, on 
your court, against your opponent.

But not at Michigan. Here, the 

players pay as much attention 
to other matches as their own. 
Last weekend against Purdue, 
as soon as the last shot of each 
point landed on their court, they 
looked over to the next court 
and yelled encouragement at 
their teammates.

“Our opponents should feel 

like they’re playing three guys, 
not one,” said redshirt sophomore 
Alex Knight.

At Steinberg’s previous stops 

— most recently at Pepperdine, 
where he spent 13 years — he has 
used this approach. It took him 
a year to get there at Michigan, 
which is why (coupled with heavy 
graduation losses), the Wolverines 
struggled last season.

But last fall, while his team 

competed in non-scoring events, 
Steinberg could tell that things 
were different and that his 
methods were starting to sink in.

In the season opener Jan. 

24 at Kentucky, Steinberg saw 
individuals playing again, and 
Michigan lost, 4-3. The following 

weekend, the Wolverines 
dominated Princeton and Cornell 
on the road, and that attitude 
changed for good.

“That was the first time I saw 

from them a real team out there,” 
Steinberg said, “and we really 
haven’t gone back.”

The players on the court played 

their points, then turned to watch 
the matches on other courts. 
The players on the sidelines 
shouted encouragement to their 
teammates. Even in warmups, 
Steinberg felt a different vibe.

“We’re not just going to hit 

tennis balls,” he said. “We’re 
going to be there for each other.”

Michigan came home from the 

East Coast, started rolling and 
hasn’t stopped. The following 
weekend, the Wolverines pulled 
off three 7-0 sweeps in three 
days, including one over No. 25 
Duke, starting a remarkable run 
of 12 straight home victories. 
The players have taken to 
calling their home courts “The 
Slaughterhouse,” trying to make 
it even more intimidating for 
opponents. That’s where they 
are most comfortable, and that’s 
where the team-first mindset has 
a chance to shine.

But such a drastic transition 

started a long time ago. Every 
single day in practice, when 
Steinberg sees his players playing 
as individuals and not as a team, 
he will stop practice and ask 
a player: Eight other guys are 
looking at you right now, and 
what are they seeing? What’s your 
body language right now? Are you 
helping anybody?

Either the player will say, “Yeah, 

you’re right, I need to change it,” 
or he’ll send Steinberg a text later, 
after the emotion has worn off, 
with the same message. That has 
happened enough times to make it 
show up during matches.

“Just like you work on 

a forehand, you work on 
teamwork,” Knight said. “Each 
day, our goal is to get better at 

recognizing lulls in matches, 
recognizing, ‘We’re a little bit low, 
someone pick it up.’”

Steinberg admits that his 

team is still far from perfect. 
Even when he won the national 
championship at Pepperdine in 
2006, his team wasn’t perfect. 
Every day, he sees moments in 
practice he needs to fix — but now 
there are considerably fewer.

“The only time you’re going 

to be able to play really your 
best tennis is when you know 
everyone else on this team has 
sacrificed everything for you, and 
they’re doing what they need to 
do,” Steinberg said. “And then 
you don’t have to worry about 
anybody. And then it just flows.”

Steinberg knows that there 

are teams that stick to playing 
an individual sport, focusing on 
their match. Some of those teams 
are even better than Michigan 
right now, one of them being Ohio 
State, which beat the Wolverines 
on March 27, 4-0.

But that still didn’t faze 

Steinberg.

“We got beat, but they never 

gave up on each other ’til the 
last point, which was terrific,” 
Steinberg said. “We got beat. 
It’s OK. Every team has a match 
like that.”

Even when they win, the 

recipe doesn’t always work. At 
one point last Sunday against 
Purdue, sophomore Runhao Hua 
led his match, 6-3, 4-4, 30-30, 
and he and Knight were both 
between points on adjacent 
courts. They met between 
courts, and Knight slapped 
Hua’s hand, hit his chest and 
encouraged him, “Come on!” 
Hua lost the last two points of 
the game, but he went on to win 
the match and clinch a victory 
for Michigan.

As Michigan’s record shows, 

Steinberg’s method works far more 
often than it doesn’t, and he hopes 
it stretches off the court, too.

“Life’s not about you. Life’s 

about giving to others, and you 
will get in return,” Steinberg said. 

“It doesn’t work the other way. I 
don’t live my life that way, and I 
don’t want them to.”

And he also recruits people 

who fit that mold.

“It’s the first thing I talk about 

with every recruit,” Steinberg 
said. “I tell them, ‘If that’s not the 
environment you want to be in, 
it’s not for you.’ I don’t hide it at 
all, and it’s not for everybody.”

If Steinberg learns that a 

player played tennis for his high 
school team or played a team 
format in juniors tennis, he 
wants that player. He’ll take him 
over a higher-ranked player who 
won’t fit in as well with what 
Steinberg is trying to do.

So some teams end up more 

talented than his. He’s different, 
and that’s OK with him. Come 
into the Slaughterhouse, listen to 
Bo Schembechler’s speech and try 
to beat his team.

The Michigan men’s tennis team has bought into an unconventional team mentality under coach Adam Steinberg.

Fahey shines in wins

By AZALEA HINOJOSA 

Daily Sports Writer

As 
freshman 
Kate 
Fahey 

spoke with a reporter following 
Sunday’s match versus Maryland, 
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein 
snuck up behind her. She wanted 
to congratulate her freshman on 
a job well done. 

Fahey helped the Michigan 

women’s tennis team secure the 
doubles point en route to a 6-1 
win over the Terrapins, wrapping 
up a successful weekend for the 
Wolverines.

After a game-packed week 

on the road, No. 11 Michigan 
traveled back home to end the 
weekend on a high note, adding 
two more wins to its undefeated 
Big 
Ten 
record. 
Saturday’s 

contest against Rutgers proved 
to be no challenge, either, as the 
Wolverines shutout the Scarlet 
Knights, 7-0. 

On both occasions, Michigan 

earned the doubles point with 
wins from freshmen Brienne 
Minor and Fahey at court No. 1 
and sophomores Alex Najarian 
and Mira Ruder-Hook at No. 2.

Just 20 minutes into play on 

Sunday, Minor and Fahey gained 
a 5-0 lead over the Terrapins 
and looked prepared to close out 
the doubles match, but it was 

Najarian and Ruder-Hook who 
were the first off the court in a 6-2 
set win. Several minor mistakes 
at No. 1 cost the Wolverines a few 
games.

For a moment, it seemed as 

though Maryland was set to 
make 
a 
comeback, 
winning 

three sets in a row as Minor and 
Fahey scrambled back and forth 
across the court to counter their 
shots. The doubles duo finally 
won Michigan its first point on 
a Maryland shot that landed just 
barely out of bounds.

“Doubles 
is 
all 
about 

momentum,” Fahey said. “Things 
can slip. We just got a little tight 
in the end and let them step in, 
but I think (Minor) did a really 
good job serving and closing it 
out.”

With Michigan claiming the 

first two doubles matches and 
the doubles point, the third 
match became irrelevant to the 
score and was stopped early. The 
Wolverines were trailing in that 
match, and senior Ronit Yurovsky 
put her head down in her hands 
as 
Bernstein 
offered 
some 

much needed encouragement. 
Yurovsky and her partner junior 
Sara Remynse managed to catch 
up to their opponents, but it was 
left unfinished at 3-4.

“Sometimes I can give up a 

few games just because I’m hard 
on myself,” Yurovsky said. “It’s 
not really what the (opponent’s) 
doing, it’s more about how 
I’m acting, so I just try to stay 
positive.”

Against 
Rutgers 
and 

Maryland, the first three to win 
their singles matches were Fahey, 
Yurovsky and Minor, with Fahey 
being the first to finish in both 
competitions. Yurovsky’s 6-4, 
6-1 sets clinched the win over the 
Terrapins for Michigan.

Fahey, as of late, has been 

more aggressive. In the past, she 
has been more defensive, but she 
mentioned that she feels on top of 
her game now.

While it came down to a nail-

biting third set, Remynse was the 
only Wolverine unable to pull off 
a victory in singles play against 
Maryland.

“As a team, we did really well,” 

Fahey said. 

The 
defending 
Big 
Ten 

champions know there are still 
some tough matchups before the 
conference tournament, but they 
are confident their success will 
continue.

“We have a lot of tennis left to 

play,” Bernstein said. “But we’re 
young, and I think we’ve beaten 
some good teams so we can 
compete with anybody.”

Freshman Kate Fahey won both her singles and doubles matches against Maryland in Michigan’s 6-1 win Sunday.

‘M’ finishes strong at home

Wolverines top 

Harvard, Princeton 
in final homestand

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

In its final home stand of the 

season, the Michigan women’s 
water polo team showed fans 
at Canham Natatorium why the 
team has climbed into the top 
10 in the national rankings.

Saturday, the eighth-ranked 

Wolverines maintained their 
undefeated conference record, 
posting 
wins 
over 
No. 
17 

Princeton and No. 13 Harvard, 
9-7 and 10-5, respectively.

In both games, Michigan 

started slowly before eventually 
finding its stride to secure the 
win.

“Something I’ve noticed a 

pattern of is, every time we play 
a team we haven’t seen for the 
first time, it’s kind of like we 
need to feel it out and see what’s 
going on,” said Michigan coach 
Marcelo Leonardi. “In terms of 
matchups, we’re prepared. But 
we start a little bit slow, and 
then once we make adjustments 
… our defense is on and then we 
slowly chip away.”

Against 

Princeton, the 
Wolverines fell 
behind 
early. 

The 
Tigers 

scored in the 
first 
minute 

and converted 
a 
five-meter 

shot less than 
four 
minutes 

later 
after 

interference 
was called on an excluded 
Michigan player to give them a 
2-0 advantage.

Despite the early mistakes, the 

Wolverines bounced back with 
two goals of their own, kick-
started by a steal-and-score from 
senior attacker Ali Thomason 
just in front of the Princeton net.

“If you go down two in the 

first quarter, there’s so much 
time 
left,” 
Thomason 
said. 

“If you go down two in the 

fourth quarter, there’s still so 
much time left, so you can’t let 
yourself get into this mindset 
that we’re two down.”

After taking the lead with 

3:31 left in the first half, 
Michigan was able to hold off 
a second half Tigers push to 
win, 9-7. Senior attacker Kelly 

Martin scored 
a hat trick in 
the game to 
propel 
the 

Wolverines to 
victory in the 
penultimate 
home game of 
her career.

Though the 

final 
home 

games 
are 

typically 
a 

time to highlight the seniors’ 
careers, the crowd in Ann 
Arbor also got a glimpse of 
the program’s future during 
Saturday’s contests. Freshman 
defender Kim Johnson tallied 
five goals against Princeton and 
added two more in the second 
game against Harvard.

“(The younger players) are 

going to do so amazing,” Martin 
said. “I’m just sad that I won’t 
be here on the team with them.”

In the game against the 

Crimson, Michigan’s defensive 
prowess was on display. The 
Wolverines 
limited 
Harvard 

to just five goals and were 
led by Thomason’s four steals 
and senior goaltender Julia 
Campbell’s four saves.

“If our offense sputters or 

certain people get neutralized, 
our press defense is really 
effective,” Leonardi said. “Teams 
struggle with it, and I feel like 
that’s what has kind of carried us 
throughout the season.

“We make everybody on the 

team play offense as well as 
defense, so I feel that if Julia has 
to make a save, it’s calculated 
and it’s tactical in terms of 
we’re funneling shots in to her.”

Offensively, Michigan again 

started slow, but got things 
going with a four-goal second 
quarter. The string of goals 
gave the Wolverines a 5-2 lead 
at the half. From that point on, 
Michigan was in control and 
cruised to a 10-5 victory over 
the Crimson. In addition to 
Thomason’s defensive duties, 
she was was also at the head of 
the Wolverine attack, scoring 
four goals in her final home 
game.

we need to feel

ICE HOCKEY
Connor loses Hobey Baker 
voting to Harvard’s Vesey

Freshman misses 
out on hockey’s 
top award despite 
71-point season

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

Though the Michigan hockey 

team was eliminated from the 
NCAA Tournament 13 days ago, 
Kyle Connor still had a chance 
to take home a trophy from 
Tampa on Friday.

But that possibility didn’t 

come to fruition.

Instead, 
the 
freshman 

forward fell just short of the 
Hobey Baker Award — behind 
Harvard forward Jimmy Vesey.

“I thought it was a cool 

ceremony,” 
Connor 
said. 

“Obviously it was just two great 
players — I was with Thatcher 
and Jimmy. I don’t think (I was 
surprised). They’re both really 
deserving … congrats to Jimmy.”

Connor was unable to join the 

ranks of the Wolverines’ other 
two Hobey Baker winners — 

Brendan Morrison and Kevin 
Porter — but his performance 
this 
season 
was 
certainly 

worthy of consideration.

Despite having a slow start 

to the season, Connor’s game 
exploded in early December 
when he was switched to 
the first line with juniors JT 
Compher 
and 
Tyler 
Motte. 

Connor ended 
the 
regular 

season with 71 
points and 35 
goals, good for 
first nationally 
in 
both 

categories. 
And his line 
mates weren’t 
far behind, as 
Compher and 
Motte finished 
second and third in points, 
respectively.

Despite 
losing, 
Connor’s 

numbers were eerily similar 
to those of Jack Eichel — who 
won the Hobey Baker in 2015. 
Eichel notched 71 points in 
40 games and averaged 1.77 
points per game. Connor, on the 
other hand, boasted the same 

point total in two fewer games, 
averaging 1.87 points per game.

But Demko, the other finalist, 

and 
Vesey 
had 
impressive 

seasons in their on right.

Vesey finished sixth in the 

nation with 24 goals while also 
leading the Crimson in points 
with 46.

Demko posted a .935 save 

percentage 
and 
1.88 

goals against 
average, 
while leading 
his team to a 
Frozen 
Four 

appearance.

Now, only 

time will tell 
if 
Connor 

will 
get 
a 

second crack 

at the honor, as he has yet to 
announce if he will return for his 
sophomore season at Michigan.

“I’m still undecided,” Connor 

said. “I’m going to sit down with 
my family the next couple days 
here and work on the decision. 
(It’s about) what’s right for 
me and what’s best for my 
development.”

“I don’t think (I 
was surprised). 

They’re both 

really deserving.”

Michigan recovers 
to win road series

Wolverines shut out 
Friday, then battle 
back to take two of 
three at Nebraska

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

With the score tied and the 

Michigan softball team in need 
of a big hit, senior center fielder 
Sierra Lawrence stepped up to 
the plate in the seventh inning 
of the rubber match between the 
Wolverines and Nebraska.

And 
Lawrence 
delivered, 

launching a two-run bomb over 
the left-field fence to break 
the stalemate and give No. 1 
Michigan (7-2 Big Ten, 29-4 
overall) an 8-6 lead.

“I 
just 
wanted 
to 
stay 

confident, have fun and hit 
the ball hard,” Lawrence said. 
“That’s what (I had) been doing 
all weekend, and it worked well.”

After Lawrence gave her team 

the lead, junior right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa 
retired 
three 

consecutive 
Cornhuskers 
in 

the bottom of the inning to give 
Michigan the win.

It 
was 
part 
of 
a 
gritty 

performance 
by 
Betsa, 
who 

began the day as the starting 
pitcher, but was lifted in the first 
inning for fifth-year senior right-
hander Sara Driesenga after a 
shaky start. Driesenga, though, 
was ineffective, and Betsa was 
called upon to re-enter the game 
in the third inning.

“When (Hutchins) took me 

out, she just told me to go to 
the bullpen and gather myself,” 
Betsa said. “I went back out (in 
the bullpen), worked on my spin 
and stopped trying too hard.”

Added Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins: “I was so impressed. 
She did such a great job coming 
back. I didn’t know if that was 
going to work, but I thought it 
was our best option. Megan did a 
fantastic job.”

Sunday’s 
victory 
gave 

Michigan the series win over 
the Cornhuskers (6-5, 25-14) 
after three close contests — the 
first two games of the series 
were low-scoring battles with 
shutdown pitching, and the 
third was a back-and-forth, 
offensive affair that featured 
several lead changes.

“We won two really tight 

and really competitive games,” 
Hutchins said. 
“This weekend 
had the feel of a 
Super Regional 
to me — very 
competitive 
softball. 
The 

games were a 
lot of fun, and 
I thought we 
responded. 
We 
worked 

through 
the 

difficult times.”

The Wolverines dropped the 

series opener on Friday, 1-0, 
after 
an 
uncharacteristically 

quiet 
performance 
by 
the 

offense. Michigan’s bats were 
held in check by poor base 
running and Nebraska pitcher 
Cassie 
McClure’s 
shutout 

performance.

Hutchins thought her team 

was too focused on its lofty 
ranking.

“We got what we deserved,” 

Hutchins 
said. 
“It’s 
not 

acceptable to be caught up in 
a ranking that means nothing 
in April. Who cares if you’re 
ranked No. 1 in April? I’d like 
to be ranked first at the end of 
June. That’s the only ranking 

that matters.”

Michigan made sure to get out 

to a fast start in the second game 
of the series Saturday — a two-
run homer in the first inning by 
senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero gave the Wolverines an 
early lead.

But the bats went cold after 

Romero’s blast, and the offense 
failed to score any runs over the 
next five innings.

Driesenga 
pitched 
well 

through the first five frames, 
but was replaced by Betsa after 
getting in a jam in the sixth 
inning. Betsa got her team out of 
the inning relatively unscathed, 

limiting 
the 

Cornhuskers 
to 
only 
one 

run.

In 
the 

following 
inning, 
Lawrence 
hit 

a 
two-run 

homer to give 
her team some 
breathing 
room, 
and 

Michigan emerged with a hard-
fought, 4-1 victory after Betsa 
finished off Nebraska in the 
bottom of the inning.

While 
Michigan 
came 

away with two wins after the 
weekend, the victories might 
be overshadowed by the loss 
following the team’s ascent to 
the top of the rankings.

And 
Hutchins 
certainly 

doesn’t want the team to forget 
her lesson that the rankings 
mean little at this time.

“We need to learn that lesson, 

and we need to get better at 
internalizing 
that 
message,” 

Hutchins said. “I thought we did 
get better (Sunday). We weren’t 
all the way where we need to be, 
but we were better.”

“This weekend 
had the feel of a 
Super Regional 

to me.”

Minnesota freezes Michigan

By COLE ZINGAS 

Daily Sports Writer

After its hottest start since 

1987, the No. 25 Michigan baseball 
team had accomplished most of its 
early-season goals and hadn’t left 
many games to linger on.

Even in the moments following 

losses to No. 23 Oklahoma State 
and Notre Dame, the Wolverines 
felt they had been improving and 
moving forward, learning and 
growing with each game.

But suddenly, there is a blemish 

on Michigan’s résumé that is much 
harder to account for.

Minnesota (4-1 Big Ten, 18-10 

overall) came to chilly Ann Arbor 
this weekend and never allowed 
the Wolverines’ bats to heat up in 
either end of a Friday doubleheader. 
The Golden Gophers’ offense, 
meanwhile, seemed much more 
cozy in the 35-degree weather, 
rattling off 21 hits in two games to 
down Michigan, 8-1, in game one 
and 5-3 in game two.

Before 
facing 
the 
Golden 

Gophers 
this 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines (3-2 Big Ten, 21-8 

overall) had been able to attribute 
much of their success to the 
consistency of the batting order.

Sophomore 
third 
baseman 

Jake 
Bivens, 

the 
leadoff 

hitter, 
has 

kick-started 
the lineup with 
a .385 batting 
average. 
And 

there isn’t much 
of 
a 
dropoff 

as the batting 
order progresses — freshman 
second baseman Ako Thomas, the 
No. 9 hitter, has solidified his spot 
with a .382 on-base percentage.

Yet, Friday, it was Minnesota’s 

lineup that bruised Michigan 
pitching from one through nine. 
In game one, the hitters No. 6 
through No. 9 each recorded 
an RBI. In game two, it was the 
top of the lineup that gave the 
Wolverines trouble, as the first 
four in the Golden Gophers’ order 
drove in one run apiece.

In the few games where the 

Michigan offense has struggled 
to get going, a dominant pitching 

staff, which has a combined 
earned-run average of 2.43, has 
picked up the slack.

Sophomore left-hander Oliver 

Jaskie 
led 

Michigan 
to 

a shutout win 
against 
No. 

11 
California 

early 
in 
the 

season. Senior 
Evan 
Hill 

allowed 
only 

one run in the 

Wolverines’ other victory against 
a ranked opponent, a 4-2 win over 
the Cowboys on March 20.

Friday, however, Minnesota 

once again flipped the script.

While the Golden Gophers 

bounced Jaskie in the fifth inning 
of game one and drew eight walks 
against lefty Brett Adcock in game 
two, Minnesota’s pitching shut 
down Michigan’s normally high-
powered offense.

The Golden Gophers’ Matt 

Fielder held off the Wolverines 
in game one, allowing only one 
run. 
Minnesota’s 
game 
two 

starter, Dalton Sawyer, didn’t 
allow a run and struck out 10 in 
six innings of work.

“You tip your cap to the 

opposition,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “But there was a lot of 
breakdowns today, fundamentally, 
that unfortunately turned out in a 
disappointing couple of games for 
us.” 

The 
doubleheader 
Friday 

marked a departure from the 
solid, fundamental baseball the 
Wolverines 
have 
consistently 

played thus far this season. In 
addition to the struggling offense 
and pitching, three errors on the 
day did not help their case.

“When you play good teams, 

it’s pitching, defense and timely 
hitting,” Bakich said. “Those are 
the three things you need to play 
good teams, and we didn’t have a 
whole lot of that.”

Michigan never had a chance 

to 
return 
to 
form 
against 

Minnesota, as weather canceled 
the final game of the series.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
hope 

to shake the April ice off their 
bats quickly, as they travel to 
East Lansing on Tuesday to 
face Michigan State, which is 
undefeated in conference play.

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Michigan struggled in all areas of the game after a hot start to Big Ten play.

“You tip your 

cap to the 
opposition.”


4B — April 11, 2016
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
SportsMonday

With junior designated hitter 
Carmen Benedetti and senior 
centerfielder Cody Bruder at the 
corners, Bruder got caught in a 
pickle trying to steal second, and 
Benedetti took advantage of the 
back-and-forth to run home.

Freshman second basemen 

Ako Thomas was a bright spot in 
the lineup that game, collecting 
a career-high three hits in four 
at-bats.

Game two of the doubleheader 

started just like the first, except 
it was junior left-hander Brett 
Adcock and Minnesota’s Dalton 
Sawyer 
who 
were 
tossing 

scoreless innings back and forth.

Adcock pitched five scoreless 

innings, getting out of bases-
loaded jams in the second, third 
and fifth. Adcock walked eight 
batters but allowed just three hits.

But Adcock was not pleased 

with how he pitched.

“I didn’t have the best day,” he 

said. “I didn’t trust the defense 
as much I needed to. I needed to 
attack the zone more, and I’ve got 
to focus on throwing more strikes.”

On the other side, Sawyer 

stymied the Michigan offense. 
He continued pitching into the 
sixth inning without giving up 
a run, fanning 10 batters along 
the way.

The Wolverines encountered 

trouble in the sixth inning. 
Junior lefty Carmen Benedetti 
gave up the game’s first run in 
relief for Adcock, and gave way to 
sophomore right-hander Bryan 
Pall with a runner on second and 
one out. Pall loaded the bases, 
but managed to come out of the 
inning unscathed.

As in game one, the Golden 

Gophers’ 
offense 
opened 
the 

floodgates in the seventh inning. 
After scoring a run on a wild 
pitch, Minnesota strung together 
back-to-back-to-back RBI hits to 
increase their lead to 5-0.

In the bottom of the seventh, 

the Golden Gophers put Brian 
Glowicki on the mound, and 
Michigan attacked immediately. 
After a walk and a single, junior 
right 
fielder 
Johnny 
Slater 

singled to right field to score a 
run and avoid the Wolverines’ 
first scoreless game of the 
season. Glowicki was removed 
without recording an out in favor 
of Lucas Gilbreath. With loaded 
bases, a hit batter and fielder’s 
choice scored two more runs to 
ease the deficit, 5-3.

“They had a sense of urgency,” 

Bakich said. “Minnesota had 
put up the four spot in the 
seventh. I think the guys had 
had enough and saved some of 
their most competitive at-bats in 
the seventh and eighth innings. 
Unfortunately it was just too 
little, too late.”

Hill, who was slated to start 

Sunday’s game, came out of the 
bullpen for the final two innings, 
in which he struck out six batters. 
His performance sparked the 
Wolverines’ offense in the eighth 

inning, but not enough to take 
the come-from-behind win.

Michigan had two runners in 

scoring position in the eighth to 
potentially tie the game, but an 
attempted suicide squeeze by Slater 
turned into a double play. Slater’s 
bunt was a short pop-up out to the 
catcher, and first baseman Drew 
Lugbauer was tagged up at third to 
end the inning.

“After a day like today, I got 

to look in the mirror and make 
sure I’m doing everything I 
can to make sure these guys 
are 
prepared 
and 
playing 

fundamentally sound so we don’t 
ever have another day where 
we have as many breakdowns,” 
Bakich said.

Though 
its 
record 
does 

not jump off the stat sheet, 
Minnesota proved to be the 
toughest competitor that the 
Wolverines have faced thus far. 
Michigan will have to improve 
in Big Ten play if it hopes to 
go 
for 
another 
conference 

tournament title.
