About 100 University of 

Michigan students, faculty 
and staff gathered Wednesday 
afternoon on the Diag to 
protest a speech to be given 

on campus later that night 
by Charles Murray, author 
of “The Bell Curve,” a book 
widely 
criticized 
for 
its 

attribution of intelligence and 
other genetic traits with race. 

Big data, data science and 

analytics were among the main 
topics discussed at the third 
annual Michigan Institute for 
Data Science daylong research 
symposium 
Wednesday 
at 

Rackham Auditorium and the 
Michigan League.

MIDAS is a product of the 

University of Michigan’s Data 
Science 
Initiative, 
an 
effort 

launched in 2015 to invest $100 
million in data science research 
and education across campus. 
Three years later, the symposium 
offered a chance for MIDAS to 
welcome leaders in data science 
research 
and 
showcase 
the 

work of University students and 
faculty.

The daylong event featured 

a lineup of speakers whose 
research 
in 
data 
science 

represented fields ranging from 
psychology to biostatistics.

Alfred 
Hero, 
co-director 

of MIDAS and professor of 
electrical 
engineering 
and 

computer science, spoke about 
how this diverse set of speakers 
aligns with the theme of the 
symposium, 
“A 
Data-Driven 

World: Potentials and Pitfalls.”

“This is the first time we have 

a theme that is really focused on 
a very broad basis of the future 
impact of data enabled scientific 
inquiry, data enabled commercial 
and lending practices and data in 
society in general,” Hero said.

Hero 
explained 
how 
the 

application of big data –– from 
transportation to the health 
sciences –– presents a similar 
challenge.

“Data is being collected about 

you and other people that is 
being used for purposes that 
nobody can predict,” he said.

These challenges were the 

focal point of the event as the 
five speakers, including the 
keynote speaker, data scientist 
Cathy O’Neil, grappled with the 

outlook for big data research 
applications and the potential 
difficulties that may arise.

Among the speakers was 

James Pennebaker, a University 
of Texas at Austin psychology 
professor, who discussed the 
integration of data analysis into 
his social psychology research 
of words. Pennebaker’s research 
applies data analysis of pronouns, 
articles and prepositions to 
environments such as trauma 

writing 
therapy, 
AOL 
chat 

rooms, college admissions essays 
and email correspondences. 

Pennebaker’s 
experience 

blending data science with social 
science research allowed him to 
gain insight into the dynamic 
between the two fields and how 
the future of data science is being 
shaped by collaboration.

“I think the best social 

psychology 
is 
now 
frankly 

Two University of Michigan 

professors 
are 
included 
in 

this year’s class of MacArthur 
Fellows, which in total comprises 
24 artists, writers, researchers 
and community leaders. The 
MacArthur 
Fellowships, 
also 

known as “genius grants,” are 
awarded to “talented individuals 
who have shown extraordinary 
originality and dedication in their 
creative pursuits and a marked 
capacity 
for 
self-direction,” 

according 
to 
the 
MacArthur 

Foundation website.

The $625,000 grants come 

with no strings attached, and are 
given simply “as an investment” 
in the potential of their recipients. 
Potential recipients are nominated 
by a pool of experts in various 
fields, and then a committee of a 
dozen chooses awardees.

In a statement, University 

President Mark Schlissel said the 
two researchers did important 
work to illuminate commonly 
overlooked areas of scholarship.

Palmer 
Commons 
was 

rocked Wednesday night by 
the presence and subsequent 
protests of Charles Murray, a 
controversial 
social 
scientist 

known for a correlation of race 

and IQ, a theory debunked 
widely over the years.

His co-authorship of the 1994 

book “The Bell Curve” draws 
connections 
between 
race, 

intelligence and socioeconomic 
status. 
Murray 
was 
invited 

to speak by the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans and the American 

Enterprise Institute University 
of Michigan Executive Council. 
A 
week 
ago, 
posters 
with 

statistics inspired by Murray’s 
book were hung near Stockwell 
Residence Hall. Despite this, 
College Republicans still held 
the event as planned.

Prior to the speech, Palmer 

Commons 
was 
placed 
on 

lockdown by the Division of 
Public Safety and Security and 
the Ann Arbor police to ensure 
any 
protests 
that 
occurred 

would stay under control. 

Only the first 200 students 

and faculty of the University 
with 
valid 
Mcards 
were 

permitted into the event. People

AOL founder Steve Case took his 

nationwide tour “Rise of the Rest” 
to Ann Arbor Wednesday to bring 
new attention to startup businesses 
originating in non-coastal areas of 
the United States.

Rise of the Rest, an initiative 

made possible by Case’s company 
Revolution, 
is 
a 
nationwide 

tour seeking to work alongside 
entrepreneurs 
championing 

businesses in “startup ecosystems.” 
During its time in a city, the 
tour visits innovative startups, 
talks 
with 
business 
leaders 

and 
celebrates 
entrepreneurs 

within the community. A pitch 
competition is thrown at the end 
of the day, where eight companies 
compete for a $100,000 investment 
from Case.

According 
to 
Case, 

approximately 50 percent of all 
U.S. venture capitalist investment 
is allocated to California, home of 
Silicon Valley, while Michigan only 
receives 1 percent of investment. 
More than half of this 1 percent 
goes directly to Ann Arbor.

attending the speech had to 
have their bags and belongings 
searched 
prior 
to 
entering 

Palmer Commons, and they 
were 
once 
again 
searched 

before entering the room where 
the speech would be held. 

LSA senior Ben Decatur, 

co-chair of the AEI Executive 
Council 
at 
the 
University, 

introduced Murray and spoke 
on the right of free speech and 
the importance of that right. He 
went on to discuss the potential 
for protest and invited any 
protesters to engage with the 
speaker instead of attempting to 
prevent Murray from speaking.

“If the hosts of tonight’s 

program, in collaboration with 
University 
representatives, 

believe 
that 
the 
protesters 

are interfering unduly with 
the 
speaker’s 
freedom 
of 

expression, 
those 
protesters 

will be warned by a University 
administrator,” Decatur said. 
“If warnings are not heeded 
and interference continues, the 

individuals responsible may be 
removed from the building.”

Decatur turned the podium 

over to Murray, who was met 
with a mixture of cheers and 
boos. As Murray began to speak, 
a student in the audience began 
playing the theme song for the 
introduction of Darth Vader in 
the Star Wars movies.

The audience raised signs 

accusing Murray of being a 
white supremacist and a racist. 
Students in the back of the 
audience began to set off alarms 
on their phones to drown out 
the words of Murray. After only 
10 minutes, the speech was 
brought to a grinding halt, as 
the protesters turned off the 
lights and projected the words 
“White Supremacist” behind 
Murray as they chanted “Racist, 
Sexist, KKK, Charles Murray go 
away.”

Students began taking turns 

to scramble up to the front of 
the room to interrupt Murray 
and read pre-written speeches 
of their own. After the first 
protester read off their speech 
accusing Murray of wanting 
the protester dead because of 

his Iranian heritage, LSA senior 
Farid Alsabeh confronted the 
protesters for denying him the 
right to listen to what Murray 
had to say. 

When 
the 
event 
had 

concluded, Alsabeh spoke on 
why he felt the need to speak 
out.

“When I saw that people’s 

first instinct was to infringe 
on my right to listen to a 
public intellectual at a public 
institution I felt like I just had 
to say: ‘Listen, you’re making it 
too much about yourself. Can 
we please think about the other 
people who are just here to 
listen to ideas?’” he said.

In an interview prior to 

the speech, Murray pushed 
back on what he thinks are 
misunderstandings 
and 

mischaracterizations 
of 
his 

work and his beliefs. 

“The 
characterization 
of 

me as a white supremacist or 
a white nationalist or any of 
the various other things is 
unaccompanied by any direct 
evidence that I believe any of 
that stuff,” Murray said.

Murray 
said 
the 
reason 

college 
campuses 
have 

become hostile to speakers, 
such 
as 
himself, 
can 
be 

attributed to the anger that 
has arisen from the election 
of President Trump. Murray 
also stated college students 
have become more sensitive 
over the past decade and he 
believes this is primarily due 
to the rise of identity politics.

Murray spent the next 

portion of the event debating 
with a student of color at the 
podium over whether “The 
Bell Curve” supports the idea 
that Blacks are less intelligent 
than whites. 

After 
the 
student 
left 

the podium, the audience 
turned to a different tactic to 
attempt to disrupt Murray’s 
speech. Instead of chanting, 
the audience instead tried to 
completely ignore Murray by 
putting in earbuds, reading 
books and opening copies of 
newspapers in front of their 
faces. 

being led by Facebook, Google 
and Microsoft,” Pennebaker said. 
“What is beginning to happen now 
is we are getting these two groups 
of people who are now at this point 
where we are able to start talking 
to each other and take advantage 
of generations of really solid social 
science that has not been informed 
by giant data.”

Information graduate student 

Kristen McGarry was in attendance 
and 
echoed 
Pennebaker’s 

sentiment 
specifically 
with 

the collaboration between the 
research and corporate spheres. 
McGarry noted how the corporate 
sponsors of the symposium such as 
TD Ameritrade and Mercury Fund 
demonstrate the corporate interest 
in data science.

“Data is growing so much, you 

kind of need both people to join 
together to continue progressing,” 
McGarry said.

Rackham 
student 
Jeff 

Lockhart, assistant organizer of 
the symposium, expressed how 
this interdisciplinary future of 
data science is a central mission of 
MIDAS and the symposium.

“MIDAS has twin goals of 

getting researchers together in 
the same room from different 
disciplines and … it funds a lot of 
projects,” Lockhart said.

Lockhart 
described 
how 

MIDAS has been successful in 
bringing people together and 
funding projects in its short 

existence.

A poster showcase at the event 

featuring more than 50 research 
projects across the University 
relating to data science emphasized 
the scope of the symposium.

The MIDAS Initiatives Panel 

featuring leaders within MIDAS’s 
research initiatives continued the 
symposium’s 
interdisciplinary 

focus.

Carol Flannagan, the principal 

investigator 
of 
MIDAS’s 

Transportation Challenge Project, 
spoke during the panel about 
how it has helped her research 
on 
transportation 
safety 
to 

include perspectives from the 
social 
sciences, 
statistics 
and 

engineering.

“One of the very cool things 

about what MIDAS is supporting 
and encouraging is these very 
large multidisciplinary teams,” 
Flannagan said. “I am working 
with people from all over campus, 
from different schools and colleges 
and people I have not worked with 
previously.”

MIDAS members are excited 

for the future of the institute as 
the symposium came to a close at 
the institute’s new space in Weiser 
Hall.

While 
Hero 
accounted 
for 

the weather being a key reason 
attendance 
was 
lower 
than 

expected, 
he 
also 
expressed 

excitement for the global audience 
of more than 4,000 viewers 
the 
symposium 
attracted 
via 

livestream. A sign, he believes, 
of the growing number of people 
interested in the work of MIDAS 
and the future of data science.

happening here,” Case said. “Part 
of this is how to turn what some 
call the Rustbelt into much more of 
a startup-belt.”

Business 
graduate 
student 

Connor Burleigh thought the 
amount of venture capital Ann 
Arbor received was significant.

“Ann Arbor gets half of the 

venture of the state; that’s huge,” 
Burleigh said. “Communities can’t 
be separate, it has to be Southeast 
Michigan as a single ecosystem.”

Gov. Rick Snyder agreed with 

Case, and discussed Michigan’s 
ingenuity 
and 
leadership 
in 

combining the IT field and 
automotive industry.

“We have that Midwestern 

humility, but we need to be louder 
and prouder,” Snyder said. “We 
need ambassadors for our city and 
state to speak up and tell our story.”

After an introductory breakfast, 

tour members of Rise of the Rest 
set out to begin a string of visits 
with Ann Arbor startups. They 
spent time at Mcity, Duo Security, 
A2 Engage, FarmLogs, NutShell, 
CaHoots and TechArb.

In Case’s opinion, one the most 

important methods to propel a 
startup community to higher 
levels of success is telling the 
community’s story.

“Not only do most people in the 

community not know what the 
success stories are, but the vast 
majority of people outside of those 
communities don’t know what 

those stories are,” Case said. “Ann 
Arbor is doing really, really well 
and most people in other parts of 
the country don’t know how well 
it’s doing.”

Later in the day, Case and a 

panel of business experts held a 
“fireside chat” to discuss in more 
detail the importance of startup 
communities and the challenges 
they face in expanding and 
developing. Dan Gilbert, founder 
of Quicken Loans Inc., and J.D. 
Vance, 
best-selling 
author 
of 

“Hillbilly Elegy,” joined Case on 
the panel. Mary Grove, director 
of Google for Entrepreneurs, was 
another panel member. 

One key topic of discussion 

was the relationship between 
Ann Arbor and Detroit. Panelists 
noted innovation, while one of 
the main focuses within each city, 
has not managed to bring the two 
together. They commented on the 
importance of bridging the gap 
between Ann Arbor and Detroit 
and how this coalition can bring 
prosperity to the region.

Business 
graduate 
student 

Tobi 
Ogundipe 
agreed 
with 

the panelists and believes this 
connection is important to draw in 
investors.

“My biggest takeaway was Dan 

Gilbert honing in on the threads 
of connection between Ann Arbor 
and Detroit,” Ogundipe said. “The 
talent is here and the companies 
are coming to Ann Arbor and 
Detroit; it makes sense to combine 
these together.”

Thursday, October 12, 2017— 3A

Following 
the 
Black 

Lives 
Matter 
protests 
and 

demonstrations of the past 
few 
weeks, 
my 
African 

American 
studies 
professor 

gave students the platform 
to have a discussion in class 
about how the racial tension on 
campus has been affecting our 
lives. After many of the Black 
students bravely shared their 
stories aloud, shed tears and 
expressed how dehumanizing 
and degrading being called a 
racial slur can make a person, 
better yet, a community feel, a 
white female student decided 
to speak up. She said (roughly 
quoting): “It breaks my heart 
to hear that when stuff like 
this happens it can remain on 
the backs of the Black students 
for the remainder of their day 
or week or even for years. It 
breaks my heart because I 
know that even though I am 
sad about it, I can leave today 
and remain totally unaffected 
and continue with my day. 
That is due in part to the 
privilege that I have as a white 
person. It allows me to remain 
unaffected and ignorant to 
what is going on with other 
people in my own community.”

Her statement shook me 

to the core. For the first time 
since I have been on campus, I 
heard a white person admit to 
the privilege of indifference. 
The privilege of neutrality in 
times of racial crisis.

This mindset of neutrality 

is one that privileged whites 
tend to have in the United 

States (and on this campus) 
regarding race. White people 
who choose not to be a part 
of the conversation of racial 
tension and who would rather 
“not take a side” perpetuate an 
endless cycle of aggression and 
attack.

From a distance, it may seem 

as if most of the white students 
do not see what is happening 
on campus. It seems that they 
are totally oblivious to our 
struggle. However, I have found 
that the issues we as people of 
color face are in fact being seen 
by white students on campus 
but it seems that they are only 
seeing us through a TV screen 
— as if these racial attacks are 

a natural disaster occurring in 
some foreign land leaving them 
totally unaffected.

Black students feel as if 

they are isolated on an island 
experiencing a calamity and all 
the complacent white students 
act as if all they can do is 
watch. They are not seeing 
our anguish through their 
own eyes, in their own halls, 
buildings and front lawns. 
They are not feeling our pain 
in their own bodies because 
even hundreds of years after 
being brought to this land, 
Black people still are only seen 
as visitors. As the girl in my 
class said, many white people 
don’t feel personally affected 
or attacked when a Black man 
is called “n*****” because they 
do not view said Black man as a 
member of their community but 
another community completely 
separate. We as Black people 
are only tolerated as guests 
on a campus we have worked 
equally as hard to reside upon. 
Therefore, 
when 
something 

happens to us, the urgency of 
the matter is only our issue 
and no one else’s. It is not that 
these white people are evil or 
would ever themselves attempt 
to dehumanize a person of 
color, it is that they choose to 
remain ignorant to the issues 
affecting people of color and 
therefore choose to remain 
neutral to any remedies.

The only way we can fix 

what is going on here is if we 
somehow make the complacent 
white students, who have no 
inclination toward either side, 
feel obligated to defend the 
identities of students of color. 
They have to know that what 
is happening is not fiction. It’s 

not alien. It’s not happening 
on a TV screen! It’s occurring 
right here and right now. The 
neutral white students have to 
feel personally affected when 
their Black neighbors are being 
attacked and they have to view 
an attack on a person of color 
in this community as an attack 
on everyone.

We can only move forward if 

they know their participation 
is integral to our movement 
for positive social change on 
campus.

I have found 

that the issues 

we as people of 

color face are 

in fact being 

seen by white 

students on 

campus but it 

seems that they 

are only seeing 

us through a TV 

screen 

I’ve 
been 
running 
for 
a 

long time, both literally and 
figuratively. I’ve been an active 
runner for seven years now. First 
as a cross-country runner in high 
school, running has become my 
biggest means of stress relief. 
Figuratively, I’ve always thought 
of life as a marathon, but this 
past summer it was put to me 
in a different way. Life can be 
thought of as more of a relay 
race. Generation to generation, 
the torch is passed down to 
continue the work of those who 
came before us. This fuels the 
altruistic thought process: “I 
may suffer, but I have great hope 
and promise that my descendants 
will not.” 

My leg of the relay started 

almost at the onset of my birth. 
I am the son of one of the few 
people I legitimately know who 
has carried out the American 
Dream; the promise to anyone 
in America that if you work hard 
enough despite your background 
you’ll be able to achieve your 
goals. My father, born in the 
destitute farm lands of Korea, 
worked his way to a Ph.D. in 
Mechanical Engineering from 
the University of Michigan. An 
epic in and of itself, I am often 
inspired by his hard work. Today, 
that dedication is channeled 
into his children, never treating 
himself.

Currently, many individuals 

in this country also aspire to 
similar dreams. However, the 
reality is often different. In an 
era of increasing wage gaps and 
sky-high college costs, it has 
become all but impossible for 
most people to find the right 
help and resources to overcome 
social stratification and move 
up in class. The “Dream” that 
many people all aspire to — one 
of true meritocracy — is instead 
biased, based on the resources 
and opportunities you are born 
into. It is no longer just as simple 
as just going to college, let alone 
being able to even get in. It begs 
the question: would someone like 
my father be able to exist today?

When people ask me about the 

American Dream, I have vivid 
images that immediately pop into 
my head.

Ann 
Arbor, 
2004. 
I 
was 

with my dad and sisters at my 
mother’s graduation. After years 
of studying, my mom had finally 

graduated with an associate’s 
degree 
in 
nursing 
from 

Washtenaw Community College. 
I ran up to hug her as I saw her 
leave the crowded auditorium, 
approaching us in her black 
graduation robes. I squeezed her 
waist and smiled at her. It was an 
interesting moment, filled with 
so much innocence of a child’s 
love for his mother, but at the 
same time, an extraordinary 
amount of ignorance and bliss. At 
the time, I did not appreciate the 
amount of sacrifice my mother 
had just made for our family. At 
my father’s urging, she had given 
up her master’s degree and career 
in art to become a nurse for a 
more stable career to help my 
family. I struggle with pre-med 
courses these days even though 
I’ve grown up speaking English 
from the age of three; I cannot 
imagine what it must have been 
like for my mother, who was just 
picking it up.

As I continued squeezing my 

mother with all the power a first-
grader could muster, I suddenly 
felt something wet hit my hair. I 
looked up, and from my mother’s 
eyes came tears, dripping onto 
my head. “Umma (mother in 
Korean), why are you crying?” I 
asked. My dad pulled out tissues 
from his pocket. How little did 
I understand what those tears 
meant to her. 

Those sacrifices did not come 

easy. What I can look back on 
now — but did not recognize at 
the time — are the many summers 
I was babysat by various relatives 
and family friends in exchange 
for housing. I did not know about 
the times my mother struggled 
to even understand sentence 
structure, let alone the more 
nuanced biochemical principle 
of glycolysis. The times she 
went to our next-door neighbor, 
a 
University 
Biomedical 

Engineering professor, to ask 
questions, sitting for hours to 
understand only a fraction of 
the words coming out of his 
mouth. The time she failed her 
first nursing license exam, felt 
dejected and almost gave up 
entirely on becoming a nurse. 
The time she studied even harder 
and finished the same NCLEX 
in record time. The many times 
my sisters and I would fall 
asleep at her feet as she stayed 
up late night listening to audio 
recordings of lectures on cassette 
tapes, 
highlighting 
textbooks 

and 
making 
flashcards. 
The 

time she started working as a 

nurse at the hospital 
and 
struggled 

communicating with 
others. 
The 
times 

she still made sure 
my sisters and I were 
being fed and taken 
to school. Through 
all these obstacles, 
she overcame and did 
the biggest favor she 
could for me; feigning 
ignorance. Ignorance 
of the struggles and 
hardships 
behind 

her warm smiles and 
delicately 
prepared 

rice and side dishes.

Incheon, 
South 

Korea, 2006. I had 
just spent my first 
weeks in Korea after 
my family had moved 
to the United States. 
But the trip was now 
over, and it was time for me to 
go home. My grandmother had 
accompanied my mother, my 
sisters and me to the airport. 
As we waited in the cavernous 
terminal for our flight to depart, 
I sat in those black cloth seats, 
feet dangling, unable to put them 
on the ground. My grandmother 
reached over and patted my 
head. She handed me my favorite 
Korean snacks as I looked into 
her eyes and smiled warmly. 
My younger sisters were getting 
restless, unused to having to wait 
for long periods of time.

Eventually, my mother and 

grandmother exchanged some 
words and my mom started 
grabbing my hand and packing all 
the bags around me. We started 
heading toward the security 
check as my mother gently 
guided me through the airport. 
I stared as the linoleum floors 
passed by. I turned around to see 
my grandmother’s beaming eyes 
and warm smile one last time. As 
a kid, I had no conception of time. 
I did not realize it would be years 
before I saw her again. With one 
hand still clasped in my mother’s 

hand and my feet working 
overtime to keep along, I waved 
back to my grandmother with 
my other hand as we boarded the 
plane.

Soon, we safely found our way 

to the right seats in the airplane. 
As we got ready for takeoff, 
something felt off. I looked over 
and my mom’s body was slowly 
moving up and down, and when 
she took off her glasses I saw 
those tears she’d been holding in 
for so long. Perhaps if the stress 
of taking care of three kids for 
two weeks wasn’t hard enough, 
I knew it was harder for her 
to say goodbye to her parents 
once again. “Umma, don’t cry!” 
I begged as she pulled out some 
tissues from her purse. Though 
I was small at the time, my heart 
ached. What could a little boy do? 
My incessant pleas fell on empty 
ears; the tears kept falling and 
falling.

Years have passed since these 

moments, and I am working my 
way toward my goals. Though 
my surroundings, friends and 
experiences 
have 
changed, 

one thing remains: a burning 

passion to work 
hard. 
Friends, 

mentors 
and 

advisors 
alike 

have told me to 
take a break and 
to relax, that I 
don’t know how 
to enjoy myself. 
My 
calendar 

is always filled with varying 
shades of colors and deadlines 
and responsibilities. There are 
many days when I almost come 
to the end of myself, but it’s the 
only way I can make peace with 
myself.

I’ve often heard advice from 

others that they don’t owe their 
parents anything, as it’s not like 
they chose their parents. While 
I can agree with this sentiment 
on some level, as you don’t want 
to spend the rest of your life 
living out someone’s vicarious 
dream, it makes it sound easy. To 
just not care. Maybe it’s just my 
personality. Maybe it’s a lot of 
other things. Maybe it is the best 
thing to do, but damn is it hard.

To my parents, for the many 

times I have blown up at you, 
I hope you can forgive me. I 
was just scared, scared that I 
wouldn’t be able to live up to your 
sacrifices. Scared that I wouldn’t 
be able to look you in the eyes as 
an adult and say your sacrifices 
were not for waste. Scared I 
wouldn’t be able to provide you 
a financially comfortable life 
as you both got older. That my 

grandparents didn’t send their 
eldest children to a foreign 
country for no good reason. I 
didn’t want to take on the torch; I 
wasn’t asked to run. It was never 
really about the shame or you 
scolding me. I’m sorry about that. 
I just couldn’t bear the weight. 

To be honest, I will always be 

the young kid in the airplane, 
unable to stretch his hands fully 
to wipe his mother’s tears and 
say the right comforting words. 
Alone in America with only my 
parents and sisters. When I see 
myself in the mirror, I’m the 
little boy standing in the airport, 
waving back to my grandmother 
who I’m not sure when I’ll ever 
see again. I’m the boy who goes 
back to Korea inches taller only 
to see my aging grandparents. I 
see my father unsure of his future 
on the farmlands of Korea, and I 
see my mother missing her family 
and struggling to understand her 
professor and coworkers because 
of the language barrier. I see 
their sacrifices in me.

I know it’s not just me. I have 

had the honor and privilege of 
meeting folks at the University of 
Michigan who strive just as hard, 
if not harder, to make a name for 
themselves and not waste the 
opportunities presented to them 
by those before. You know who 
you are. Here’s to immigrants 
and all the other runners in the 
world who are bearing the torch 
and striving for a better future. 
Fight on.

“A

s a straight, white, 
cisgender 
man 

of relatively high 

socioeconomic 
status 
and 

having been raised 
in 
the 
Catholic 

Church …”

That’s 
how 
I 

started my sentence. 
It 
was 
a 
muggy 

July 
evening 

in 
New 
Jersey, 

with 
mosquitoes 

everywhere and the 
temperature 
easily 

over 80 degrees still 
after dark. I was 
spinning around on an old 
deck chair in my backyard. A 
close friend of mine from high 
school had come over to catch 
up — we hadn’t seen each other 
in months — and somewhere 
along the way, between talk 
of 
last 
semester 
and 
our 

plans, we started discussing 
religion. I was fascinated with 
Hinduism at the time, and 
I was asking this friend, an 
Indian American, how I might 
approach that interest in a 
respectful, non-appropriative 
way. But she cut me off.

She raised her hand, signaling 

that I should stop, and smiled, 
saying, “Brett, just say what 
you’re about to say, I already 
know all of these things about 
you.” She told me that I didn’t 
need to qualify every statement 
every time I opened my mouth. 
It took a second for me to 
process, but then we moved on 
with our conversation.

This may seem like a small 

moment, an obvious way to 
streamline our conversation 
and make it so that I didn’t 
have to repeat the paragraph 
of my privilege I’ve grown 
accustomed to another five 
times. A timesaver, more or 
less. Months later, though, 
as I reflect on it, I think this 
moment speaks volumes about 
the way dialogues can work.

Maybe this interaction stood 

out to me because a few months 
earlier I had seen a similar 
dialogue go horribly wrong. 

Another friend of 
mine and I were 
spending some time 
together and, over 
the course of several 
days, all we did was 
disagree — on topics 
ranging from how 
to define cultural 
appropriation 
to 

whether trap music 
was an inherently 
depressing 
genre 

made by sad people trapped in 
a vortex of hypermasculinity 
(it was a long week). This all 
culminated in her screaming at 
me — in a very public setting — 
that I needed to come around 
to her point of view and spend 
more time reading what she 
had read or risk “being just 
another dumb white guy who’s 
literally destroying the world.” 
The real quote had more 
expletives than this or any 
other newspaper would allow.

So 
what 
made 
the 

difference 
between 
these 

two interactions? Something 
was profoundly absent in the 
latter, and the only word I 
can think of to describe it is 
trust. Trust that I was at least 
somewhat informed, somewhat 
empathetic, somewhat engaged 
— that I was trying to put aside 
my privilege and understand 
another point of view. That’s 
what 
made 
the 
discussion 

about 
Hinduism 
work; 
my 

friend trusted me to make my 
best effort to honestly listen. 
Meanwhile, the lack of that 
kind of trust led to me being 
branded as an active member 
of a race intent on destroying 
the world.

To be clear, I by no means 

think I have a free pass from 
now on, with her or anyone 
else. I had to work to earn that 

trust, and that’s the way it 
should be. I’ll continue to work 
to earn the trust of others, all 
the while expecting nothing.

The reality is that as a 

straight, 
white, 
cisgender 

man of decent socioeconomic 
status on this campus, I’m 
accustomed to recognizing my 
privilege before I speak in most 
groups. It only takes a second 
or two. I’ve learned how my 
identity tends to dominate 
a conversation and take up 
space, and I’m consistently 
doing my best to break that 
mold and listen instead. But 
this one time, I got a pass. And 
it felt great.

The role of a straight, white, 

cis — well, you get it by now. 
The role of guys like me within 
our 
socio-cultural-political 

cohort is often difficult to 
navigate. Sometimes, the right 
thing to do is to speak out, to 
use your privilege to point 
out 
and 
correct 
injustice. 

Sometimes, the right thing to 
do is to sit back and listen and 
empathize. 
Distinguishing 

between the two is almost 
always challenging.

Liberal white men don’t need 

sympathy, though, nor do they 
need safe spaces of their own to 
figure it out. And it’s no one’s job 
to give us a pat on the back when 
we happen to do something 
right. But it’s helpful, in all 
dialogues between friends, to 
be conscious of that sense of 
trust. Knowing when you still 
have to work to earn it helps 
you capture the right tone, 
to temper your statements. 
Conversely, 
for 
those 
who 

are in a position to show that 
trust, knowing when to take 
down a barrier, however small, 
can bring these dialogues to 
another level of depth.

A

fter trial and error 
with plant-based eating 
over the course of this 

year, I finally decided to ditch 
the dairy products I relied on 
and be a “real vegan.” I always 
imagined 
when 
I 
changed 

my diet I would have some 
challenges with cravings for 
my favorite comfort foods. 
Surprisingly, the challenges I 
experience have instead been 
from the stigma associated 
with being a vegan.

Last 
week, 
standing 
in 

the buffet line at my friends’ 
potluck, I soon realized that 
there were not many dishes 
I could eat. Limited by my 
options, I reached the end of the 
line where two loaves of garlic 
bread laid side by side. The first 
one was labeled “no cheese,” 
and the other had cheese on 
top. I grabbed a piece of the one 
with no cheese, assuming it had 
to be vegan, and sat down at a 
table with friends to eat and 
catch up.

I took a few bites of the bread 

and it tasted pretty great. The 
flavor was familiar, and after 
I finished the piece, I guessed 
there had to be butter in it. I 
could feel the heat flushing into 
my cheeks as I asked around 
the table to see who made the 
bread and if there were any 
other animals products in it. 
When they answered there 
was, in fact, milk and butter 
in the bread, I was mad and 
embarrassed that I allowed 
myself to eat this bread without 
asking before.

I know it was just one piece 

of bread and there is no way 
it could hurt me, but I was 
pissed at myself. Why was I so 
embarrassed to ask what was in 
the food? Why is this something 
that I always find myself trying 
to avoid in social settings? Did 
I secretly hope the bread was 

vegan so I could just enjoy some 
damn good garlic bread like 
everyone else?

I 
find 
myself 
in 
this 

situation whenever I go to 
events and parties where there 
are 
catered 
or 
homemade 

foods. Realistically, I know 
I can easily ask the people 
who cooked the food what 
ingredients 
are 
in 
their 

dishes. 
But 
asking 
these 

simple questions about food 
brings negative attention that 
makes me feel as if I am being 
difficult, annoying or making 
an issue for everyone else.

Before I stopped eating meat, 

I felt as if the vegetarians and 
vegans in my life were always 
talking about their diets, and 
I found it annoying. When I 
would go out to eat with them 
I was nervous they would make 
me feel uncomfortable about my 
food choices or try to push their 
“agenda” on me. Therefore, 
since I stopped eating meat, 
I always had these opinions 
lingering in the back of my 
mind, and I have been actively 
trying to distance myself from 
this negative stereotype.

In the beginning, I did not 

even want to associate myself 
with the label “vegetarian.” If 
someone asked me about it, I 
would casually answer, “I just 
don’t eat meat,” because I didn’t 
want the label to give others 
the power to make assumptions 
about kind of person I was as 
a vegetarian. But as time went 
on, and I continued to cut more 
and more animal products from 
my diet, I knew that I would 
need to start using a form of 
this label.

Now, when my veganism 

comes 
up 
in 
conversation, 

as I expected, I see people 
processing 
their 
own 

preconceived opinions about 
my lifestyle. I wish I didn’t 

care what people thought, 
but even as I am writing this 
column, I feel nervous that 
readers will think I am being 
That Annoying Vegan, that I 
am just using this space to 
push my plant-based agenda 
on my readers. And it is hard 
not to think this with all of the 
anti-vegan jokes and memes 
I see online. Though I still 
find them funny, I wish there 
were a way people could see 
veganism the way I do.

I chose my vegan lifestyle 

because I found this was the 
best for my body and mind. 
In addition, I want to do less 
harm to living creatures and the 
planet we share. It is a choice, 
and I want to acknowledge I’m 
aware there is a privilege in 
being able to eat this way. This 
diet or lifestyle is not accessible 
to everyone, and it is not my 
place to tell another what they 
should put in their body. In fact, 
I believe it is everyone’s right to 
choose what feels best and truly 
satisfies their body’s needs.

This is the only body I will 

ever have. I know I should 
not feel sorry or shameful for 
being autonomous over my 
diet, body and impact on this 
world. I am not going to let 
the negative stereotypes about 
veganism affect the way I live 
my life. The values I hold and 
the lifestyle I live do not make 
me any better than the next 
person. They only allow me 
to have control in a system 
where I feel powerless. No 
one should ever feel shame 
in asking questions, because 
staying true to your values and 
standing up for justice over 
your body, the living beings 
around you and the planet is 
never inconvenient.

Homelessness: A tale of two cities

EMILY HUHMAN | COLUMN

I 
 

grew up in Traverse City. Ask 
any University of Michigan 
student from Traverse City 

about their hometown, and they 
will 
describe 
the 

beautiful 
beaches, 

bustling 
downtown 

and Moomer’s, our 
town’s treasure (it’s 
the best ice cream in 
the 
United 
States). 

While 
these 
are 

all a part of what 
makes Traverse City 
what it is, one thing 
is often left out in 
the 
conversation 

surrounding 
the 
city: 

homelessness. 

Homelessness is an issue that 

is prevalent in Traverse City 
and Ann Arbor, but the issue is 
relatively invisible to those who 
are unaffected by it.

Out of the 15,479 people who 

live in Traverse City, about 94 
people experience homelessness. 
Traverse City is not considered a 
hub for the homeless; therefore, 
the city is not given funding from 
the state and federal government 
to help deal with the homelessness 
problem. As a result, it has been 
up to nonprofits to try to care for 
the homeless in the city.

I began to volunteer at Safe 

Harbor, one of the nonprofits 
serving 
the 
community’s 

homeless. 
There, 
I 
learned 

about the problems facing my 
hometown’s homeless population. 
As the main organization working 
to serve the homeless, Safe 
Harbor is a collection of churches 
that makes meals and provides 
“bed-nights,” or overnights in one 
of its participating churches.

In the winters of 2011 and 

2012, 
Safe 
Harbor 
provided 

5,540 bed-nights and more than 
11,000 meals to 158 different 
homeless folks. Though Safe 
Harbor provides much help and 
services to the homeless, the help 
is only temporary — nothing they 
provide is permanent. Rather, 
federal and state funding is 
necessary to provide permanent 
solutions 
to 
Traverse 
City’s 

homelessness issue.

Of the 364,709 people living 

in 
Washtenaw 
County, 
342 

of those people experienced 
homelessness on a given day in 
January 2016. Unlike Traverse 
City, Washtenaw County has 
taken a much more active role in 
reducing homelessness. While 
Traverse 
City 
relies 
almost 

solely on private nonprofits, Ann 

Arbor and Washtenaw County 
have implemented governmental 
programs to curb homelessness 
in their communities. In 2015, 

Washtenaw 
County 

implemented 
the 

Zero:2016 
program, 

now called Built for 
Zero. This is a national 
program that aims 
to help communities 
develop and utilize 
existing 
resources 

to help those on the 
streets. The program 
has seen a lot of 
success in Ann Arbor 

— 172 homeless veterans and 
158 of the chronically homeless 
were able to get off the streets. 
If Traverse City’s government 
implemented 
this 
type 
of 

program, it could likely reduce 
homelessness.

In 
addition, 
a 
lack 
of 

affordable housing in Traverse 
City contributes to housing 
insecurity and homelessness. 
As wealthy retirees have begun 
to settle in Traverse City, 
housing prices have increased 
substantially. Some downtown 
apartments and condominiums 
are on the market for more 
than $1 million. These prices 
are outrageous; middle-class 
citizens cannot afford these 
apartments, 
let 
alone 
the 

working homeless. As a result, 
homeless people in the area are 
often in danger, either because 
of cold winters or vicious 
beatings by other homeless 
people or local teenagers.

Many attempts have been 

made to build affordable housing 
units in Traverse City, but these 
projects have faced considerable 
pushback from some portions of 
the community. In 2016, Traverse 
City’s city commission sold an 
unused government building to 
Safe Harbor for $50,000 after 
two years of debate. This building 
will be turned into a permanent 
home for Safe Harbor and open as 
a shelter in 2018.

Critics wondered if building a 

homeless shelter was the best use 
of the land. Others worry that the 
increase in services will lead to 
more homeless people moving into 
the area. However, statistics show 
this has not happened. In Traverse 
City, 74 percent of the homeless 
are from Grand Traverse County 
and 93 percent are from Michigan. 
As a result, in the deal with Safe 
Harbor, 
city 
commissioners 

stipulated that if a housing 

proposal comes along within 10 
years, part of the property will be 
used for housing the homeless.

Ann 
Arbor 
has 
faced 
a 

similar problem with affordable 
housing. Listing prices have 
increased 10.6 percent from 
April 2016. Now, the average 
listing price in Ann Arbor 
is $320,335, a price that is 
impossible 
for 
low-income 

individuals to afford. Officials 
in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti 
have said they plan to add 3,137 
affordable renting units. While 
this is a great step, it can still 
be difficult for extremely low-
income people to afford these 
units. 
Additionally, 
funding 

cuts have forced a shelter to 
cut 27 beds. More affordable 
housing and homeless shelters 
are needed to further reduce 
homelessness in Ann Arbor.

The homeless in the Traverse 

City 
area 
have 
also 
been 

working to become more visible. 
In 2011, the first issue of “Speak 
Up 
Magazine,” 
a 
magazine 

written 
by 
homeless 
folks 

about issues affecting them, 
was released in Traverse City. 
People can submit articles, short 
stories, poems or artwork to 
the magazine. Once published, 
the 
homeless 
can 
become 

vendors after going through an 
interview. The vendors can keep 
any profits they receive. Though 
“Speak Up Magazine” does not 
solve the systematic problems 
of homelessness, it has provided 
a look into the lives of Traverse 
City’s homeless population and 
given them a voice. 

Ann Arbor’s “Groundcover 

News” 
is 
a 
comparable 

publication. You might see these 
vendors in yellow vests around 
Ann Arbor — feel free to stop by 
and pick up a copy.

I am so grateful to have grown 

up in Traverse City. However, 
the city can do a lot more to 
help the homeless people in the 
area. While visibility for the 
homeless in Traverse City may 
be increasing with “Speak Up 
Magazine,” more can be done 
by local leaders to help those in 
need. Ann Arbor has been able to 
implement some governmental 
solutions. Traverse City can 
take a cue from Ann Arbor 
and implement more city-wide 
programs and actively look for 
affordable housing solutions.

Defensive line steps into driver’s seat for top-ranked unit

In order to replace all but 

one starter from last year’s 
defensive unit, the No. 17 
Michigan football team went 
through a heated competition 
at nearly every position. 

As the Wolverines’ 2017 

season now approaches its 
sixth week, that competition 
is still in full swing. But rather 
than at each specific position, 
the competition has moved 
between the position groups.

The 
defensive 
line, 

linebackers 
and 
secondary 

have all played a role in 
Michigan 
becoming 
the 

No. 1 overall defense in the 
country in their own unique 
ways. From putting pressure 
on opposing quarterbacks to 
stopping power run games to 
neutralizing fluid pass attacks, 
each specific unit has come 
into its own despite replacing 
so many components of last 
year’s team.

Up until the Michigan State 

game, the linebacker core had 
a pretty tight hold on the top 
spot.

Fifth-year 
senior 
Mike 

McCray, the sole returning 
starter, has led the unit to 
even greater heights in his 
final season as a Wolverine. 
He recorded a career-high 11 
tackles as well as two tackles-
for-loss against Air Force en 
route to a spot in the Big Ten 
Defensive Team of the Week.

McCray has partnered with 

sophomore Devin Bush Jr., who 
has emerged as a consistent 
threat against both opposing 
running and passing games. 
He has racked up 41 tackles, 
six tackles-for-loss, five sacks 
and four pass breakups in just 
five games this season. Last 
week, Bush was added to the 
Chuck Bednarik Award watch 

list, which honors the best 
defensive player in the nation.

The unit has also received 

standout contributions from 
sophomore 
Khaleke 
Hudson, 
who 

now 
occupies 

the VIPER role 
made 
famous 

by 
former 

Wolverine 
Jabrill Peppers. 
Hudson 
made 

his first career 
interception 
against 
Air 

Force, along with five tackles 
and a career-high three pass 
breakups. 
Just 
two 
other 

Michigan players have a pick 
to their names.

The defensive line has given 

the linebackers a run for their 
money, though. And against 
the Spartans, the D-line made 

its 
strongest 

case yet.

The 
trio 
of 

fifth-year tackle 
Maurice Hurst, 
redshirt junior 
end 
Chase 

Winovich 
and 

sophomore end 
Rashan 
Gary 

had 
arguably 

their 
best 

performance 

of 
the 
season 
individually 

and collectively despite the 
loss. 
Defensive 
line 
coach 

Greg Mattison took the time 
Wednesday to praise each of 

the three for their respective 
performances on Saturday.

In his breakout game of the 

year, Hurst tallied 10 tackles 
with a whopping 
3.5 for loss in 
the middle.

“(He) 
had 

a 
really 
good 

ball 
game,” 

Mattison 
said. 

“(He) 
has 

done 
some 

really, 
really 

good 
things. 

Obviously, 
as 

a senior, in big 
games, you want to play your 
best. He’s been practicing that 
way to do it, and I was happy 
for him.

“He’s 
capable 
of 
doing 

that a lot this year. He’s very 
explosive. The thing I’m proud 
of is that he’s been a good 
leader and he’s worked very, 

very hard. And 
the 
guys 
look 

up to him and 
you want guys 
like that to have 
the reward of 
playing 
like 

that.”

Winovich, 

who was another 
midseason 
addition 
to 

the 
Bednarik 

Award watch list after earning 
Walter Camp Defensive Player 
of the Week honors, made 
nine 
tackles 
and 
notched 

one quarterback hit from the 

outside.

“There was a play in that 

Michigan State game — when 
he broke the run,” Mattison 
said. “(He) ran around the 
entire defense and ended up 
making the tackle 50 yards 
downfield. And there were 
secondary guys running as 
hard as they could.

“It’s just Chase’s burning 

desire to be the best he can be.”

Gary, who — along with 

Hurst — had already been 
named 
to 
the 
Bednarik 

Award watch list, recorded 
eight 
tackles 
and 
another 

quarterback hit from the edge.

“I’m very proud of Rashan 

because he continues to try 
to work on his technique and 
continues to try to do what 
the defense asks him to do,” 
Mattison 
said. 
“And 
great 

things are going to happen 
because of that.

“He’s right down the middle 

of a tight end, whereas you see 
(Hurst) is shaded on a guard, 
you see the nose is shaded 
on a guard and (Winovich) 
is shaded on a tackle, so you 
already 
have 
the 
edge. 
… 

Some guys at some programs 
would complain about that. 
He doesn’t. He just plays the 
defense like it’s supposed to be 
played.”

While Mattison lauded his 

unit, linebackers coach Chris 
Partridge 
expressed 
less 

enthusiasm about his.

“We were okay — not our 

best performance — but again, 
(we) didn’t do things to win the 
game.”

Almost halfway through the 

2017 season, the two position 
groups are still battling it out 
on a weekly basis. Though 
the defensive line has now 
stepped into the driver’s seat, 
the ongoing competition has 
ultimately 
helped 
lead 
the 

defense to the top spot overall.

Against Michigan State, the Wolverines’ front three made their claim for the best position group

Grading Michigan’s special teams unit through five games

New punters. New kickers. 

New returners. New everything.

Special teams coordinator 

Chris Partridge has had a lot 
on his plate this year, which 
has been a big change from 
last season when just two 
players handled all of the 
responsibilities.

Former 
Wolverine 
Kenny 

Allen used to command all 
three kicking duties (kickoffs, 
punts and field goals), and 
former linebacker and Heisman 
finalist Jabrill 
Peppers 
used 

to line up for 
every punt and 
kick return.

But Allen and 

Peppers 
have 

left Ann Arbor, 
and new players 
had to step in. 
Partridge 
had 

to modify and 
rework 
the 

starters in the first few games, 
but it seems like the depth chart 
is now finalized.

With midterm season in full 

swing at the University, here 
are our grades for Michigan 
football’s 
different 
special 

teams groups. 

Kickoffs
Redshirt junior kicker James 

Foug owns this spot. Now in 
his fourth year on the team, 
Foug has solidified his role as 
Michigan’s starting kicker. He’s 
got a strong leg — about two-
thirds of his kickoffs go for 
touchbacks — and Partridge has 
taken notice.

“He’s 
developed 

tremendously,” Partridge said. 
“He’s a guy who last year was 
just 
behind 
Kenny 
(Allen). 

It was close, but we had the 
experience of Kenny so we went 
with him.

“But James had a great year 

this year, and he’s doing a great 
job of putting the ball up there 

high and giving our kickoff 
team a nice advantage there.”

Partridge noted that Foug 

worked all summer to give his 
kicks a longer hang time.

It’s paying off.
Grade: A

Punting
The punter position hasn’t 

been as steady for Michigan.

Redshirt freshman Will Hart 

punted in the first three games 
against 
Florida, 
Cincinnati 

and Air Force, averaging 37.9 
yards per punt. To put that in 
perspective, 
Allen 
averaged 

43.3 
yards 
per 

punt last year.

Hart 
was 

subbed 
out 
for 

freshman 
Brad 

Robbins 
at 
the 

start of the Big 
Ten season, and 
so Robbins seems 
to have the upper 
hand so far.

Robbins’ 

punts 
average 

42.6 yards — just shorter than 
Allen’s. He also displayed his 
good catching ability in the 
rainy game against Michigan 
State, a rivalry game that has 
a recent history of punters 
making crucial mistakes.

Partridge said that the “sky 

is the limit” for Robbins and 
that the true freshman has done 
everything they’ve asked of him 
so far.

While both Hart and Robbins 

have seen a few whiffed punts 
skim off the side of their foot, 
there have been no major 
miscues.

Grade: B

Field goal
The field goal unit has been 

spot on.

Redshirt 
freshman 
kicker 

Quinn Nordin has converted 86 
percent of his field goals, and 
his only two misses came in the 
season opener against Florida.

The 
group 
consists 
of 

Nordin, 
fifth-year 
senior 

holder Garrett Moores and 
redshirt freshman long snapper 
Cameron Cheeseman. The trio 
played a big part in getting the 
Wolverines 
through 
games 

early in the season and may be 
called upon again.

Grade: A+

Punt return
Freshman receiver Donovan 

Peoples-Jones is gutsy, and it 
almost cost him the starting 
punt returner job.

Since a few questionable 

fair-catch 
decisions 
against 

Cincinnati, Peoples-Jones has 
been solid. He returned a punt 
for a touchdown against Air 
Force, and the coaches continue 
to express their faith in his 
ability.

“You haven’t seen the last 

of (Peoples-Jones) in the end 

zone,” Partridge said. “He’s 
getting really comfortable back 
there. I think we’ll have some 
big plays out of him coming 
forward.”

As a returner, Peoples-Jones 

is fearless. Partridge said that 
he has a great ability to track 
the ball, catch it and then make 
one or two defenders miss.

“And he’s big, so he can 

run through those tackles,” 
Partridge said. “He’s fast, so he 
can break open when he makes 
them miss.”

Grade: B+

Kick return
Sophomore receiver Kekoa 

Crawford started the season as 
Michigan’s lead kick returner, 
but freshman defensive back 
Ambry Thomas took over for 
Crawford 
against 
Michigan 

State last weekend.

Thomas returned one kick for 

30 yards against the Spartans, 
almost breaking loose for a 
bigger gain.

“Ambry’s ready,” Partridge 

said. “He’s ready to go back 
there now. He’s explosive, he’s 
fast, he’s fearless. Really excited 
about him.”

The kickoff return blocking 

is one area Partridge thinks 
needs to improve. Even if only 
one player misses his block, 
opponents can make the tackle. 
That’s the difference between 
a 30-yard kick return and a 
touchdown.

If the blocking improves, 

Partridge expects Thomas — 
or whoever returns the kicks 
— to break one through for a 
touchdown soon.

Grade: B-

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Redshirt freshman kicker Quinn Nordin continues to excel for the Wolverines, as he has now converted on 12 of his 14 field goal attempts through five games.

COURTESY OF SAHANA

Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi: Preserving 
a tradition on a college campus through dancing

B-SIDE LEAD

As global citizens in this 

day, interdisciplinary thinking 
has become more important 
than ever, and places that bring 
together 
multiple 
disciplines 

are crucial. At the University 
of 
Michigan, 
the 
Michigan 

Sahana has combined culture 
and performance art of classical 
Indian origin to create a unique 
collaborative space.

Michigan Sahana is a student 

organization founded in 2003. 
Originally formed as the Indian 
Classical 
Dance 
and 
Music 

group on campus, the focal 
point has been on classical art 
forms of India. The members 
work throughout the school 
year to showcase student talent, 
educate members of their own 
culture and spread awareness of 
the diversity of classical Indian 
music and dance forms. Styles 
presented by Michigan Sahana 
include Hindustani and Carnatic 
music, as well as dance forms 
like Bharatanatyam, Kathak and 
Kuchipudi.

Michigan Sahana has three 

pillars that drive its mission 
of 
cultural 
and 
community 

enrichment: cultivating talent, 
mounting performance concerts 
and creating a safe space for 
people to come together.

LSA 
senior 
Shalini 
Rao 

is the current president of 
Michigan 
Sahana. 
She 
said 

the organization has a breadth 
of resources available to its 
members, which is a strong point 
of the group.

“It really does allow you to 

cater to your own interests and 
prioritize whatever aspects of 
Sahana you want to prioritize 
— 
whether 
it’s 
bonding, 

performance or a little bit of 
everything,” Rao said. “It does 
fulfill a cultural role for me and it 
also fulfills an arts role. … One of 
the ways I can stay in touch with 
my culture is through practicing 
and learning more about this art 
that I’ve been doing since I was 4 
years old.”

As the president of Michigan 

Sahana, Rao emphasized her 
goal to provide these resources 
and networks for other members. 
Since January, she has worked to 
maintain and broaden the scope 
of this support system.

“Whether that means giving 

them particular performance 
opportunities 
or 
connecting 

them with local teachers, if 
they’re here for that purpose of 
improving their performance 
and their art form, we want to 
be able to fulfill that,” she said. 
“There are people that are really 
passionate 
about 
spreading 

awareness — I want to make sure 
that Michigan Sahana can grow 
its campus presence.”

Along with the wealth of 

resources, the organization is 
unique in its approach to the 
performing arts.

Business junior Manasvini 

Rao is the treasurer for Michigan 
Sahana, and a longtime Carnatic 
violin player. She spoke about 

the group’s commitment to the 
traditional performance form, 
something that sets Michigan 
Sahana apart from other cultural 
groups on campus.

“I think we’re one of the few 

organizations that stays really 
pure in terms of the arts — we 
don’t do any Bollyfusion, we 
don’t combine with any modern 
interpretations, we try to stay 
true to our roots,” she said.

Manasvini’s 
years 
of 

experience in and appreciation 
for classical Indian performance 
art 
is 
not 
uncommon 
for 

members of Michigan Sahana. In 
fact, many members carry more 
than a decade of training before 
even starting college, such as 
LSA senior Naveena Thota..

“I’d always liked dancing 

along to music. When I was 
little, my parents noticed that 
I really enjoyed dancing on my 
own,” Thota said. Subsequently, 
Thota’s parents put her in 
classical dance classes to learn 
a popular style among the 
diaspora.

“I feel like a lot of parents feel 

like it’ll bring their kids closer to 
their roots,” she said.

Thota spoke about her lifelong 

commitment to classical Indian 
dance until college. Her story 
aligned with other members 
who 
also 
traveled 
far 
and 

dedicated extensive hours to 
rigorous 
training. 
However, 

Thota mentioned her dedication 
faltered in college with the busy 
lifestyle.

“It’s been a struggle trying to 

keep it up, but again, because I’m 
passionate about it, I’ve kept it 
up as much as possible,” she said. 
“I think what’s more important 
to me is being associated with 
arts and the art form in general 
— understanding that even if I 
can’t be dancing all the time, 
I’m understanding other things 
about 
classical 
dances 
and 

classical music and 
I’m learning about 
the 
history 
and 

significance.”

Manasvini 

also finds ease in 
maintaining 
her 

Carnatic 
violin 

practice 
with 

Michigan Sahana. 
She 
explained 

her family’s rich 
history 
with 

classical 
arts, 

ranging 
from 

singing 
and 

dancing to visual 
arts.

“I wasn’t sure 

about 
my 
skills 

and if it would 
be up to par with 
what 
Michigan 

Sahana 
produces 

in 
concerts, 
but 

I 
found 
such 
a 

supportive 
group 

of people who were 
willing to put me 
in,” Rao said. “I 
think 
because 
I 

kept playing, I had 
my 
one 
artistic 

outlet in college. 
Honestly, 

I would probably go insane 
without it.”

As a student in the Business 

School, 
Manasvini 
spoke 

about her everyday life being 
immersed in quantitative or 
qualitative work, rather than 
the humanities or arts. For her, 
Michigan Sahana is a break from 
the regular obligations of school, 
but she is not alone in finding 
freedom in Sahana.

Engineering senior Raghav 

Muralidharan was also exposed 
to Indian classical music at a 
young age and joined Michigan 
Sahana, 
following 
his 
older 

brother. Even before college, he 
knew he too wanted to be a part 
of the community of friends the 
organization provides. Now in 
his final year, he finds in joy in 
mentoring newer members and 
helping them find their roots in 
the Sahana family.

“Arts 
in 
general, 
musical 

expression, 
is 
a 
rest 
from 

school,” 
Muralidharan 
said. 

“They complement each other 
in a way. In music, there’s a lot 
creativity and improvisation, a 
lot of working with other people. 
While the feelings and actual 
expression is different, a lot 
of what I do in engineering is 
similar in those themes. I feel 
like it has made me think better 
as an engineer.”

The interdisciplinary nature 

of Michigan Sahana doesn’t end 
there. The organization is an 
active collaborator with other 
cultural 
groups 
on 
campus, 

performing in at least one large 
colloaborative production every 
year.

“Even 
though 
this 
title 

as being an Indian classical 
organization, we do welcome and 
accommodate a lot of different 
people from a lot of different 
backgrounds. 
I 
think 
that’s 

something we can all take away 
as a lesson from Sahana, that 

being inclusive is always a good 
thing,” Thota said. “You can only 
learn from being inclusive and 
getting to know other people.”

Given the current political 

climate 
and 
recent 
racist 

incidents 
on 
campus, 
this 

inclusivity 
is 
perhaps 
more 

important than ever. Michigan 
Sahana’s 
president, 
Shalini 

Rao, reiterated this openness 
and acceptance as a start to 
dissolving tensions on campus 
and healing the afflicted.

“Personally, 
it 
is 
very 

important because we are a 
student organization primarily 
composed of minority students,” 
Rao said. “We want to make 
sure that not only our students, 
but every student who may be 
experiencing similar challenges 
on this campus, know that 
Sahana is at least one place they 
can find that solidarity with 
fellow community members — 
whether or not they look like us, 
dance like us, sing like us. We are 
that space.”

Krithika 
Balakrishnan, 

Shalini’s collaborator and vice 
president of Michigan Sahana, 
echoed these sentiments on the 
group’s unique campus presence. 
She said Michigan Sahana’s dual 
role as an arts and culture group 
allows it to facilitate dialogue 
on campus through music and 
dance.

“Even 
though 
different 

types of performance arts from 
different countries or cultures 
are vastly different in how 
they appear on stage, there’s 
still 
commonalities 
within 

the 
music 
or 
movements,” 

Balakrishnan said. “It’s this 
common medium where people 
don’t necessarily need language 
to relate to each other. Because 
it conveys emotions and feelings, 
something 
that’s 
universal 

across so many cultures and so 
many people, it’s a unique way to 

bring people together.”

Balakrishnan also spoke about 

her own goals as vice president. 
Although 
Michigan 
Sahana 

already emphasizes diversity, 
she is constantly working to 
bridge the gap between different 
cultural groups on campus.

“I want to do a lot more collage 

with other organizations and 
bring about more discussions 
about diversity on campus,” she 
said.

Even 
though 
the 

organization’s 
work 
on 

expanding its campus identity is 
ongoing, the unwavering bonds 
within Michigan Sahana are 
apparent from the continued 
emphasis on a sense of family.

“As a person of color, the social 

climate and campus climate has 
been disconcerting. I’m glad that 
I have a community and I’m glad 
for others to express what they 
need to express,” Muralitharan 
said.

However, the profoundly deep 

effects of Michigan Sahana go 
beyond the University campus 
and local community.

Michigan Sahana members 

share an interest in classical 
Indian performance art, but their 
exposure and experiences with 
it vary significantly. There are 
Indian-American members who 
have been raised exclusively in 
America, international students 
from India itself, those who 
don’t have any prior exposure to 
Indian culture and everything in 
between.

“With 
globalization 
and 

having 
immigrated 
and 

assimilated into new cultures, 
I think it’s really important 
that cultures don’t get lost 
somewhere in the mix,” Thota 
said. “Just because everything 
is globalizing and everyone’s 
getting to know other cultures 
doesn’t mean that we need to 
become one big mainstream 

culture.”

Despite 
this 

diversity 
within 

its 
members, 
a 

common theme in 
their stories is a 
deep appreciation 
for their roots.

“Growing 

up, it was really 
important to my 
parents and to me 
that I didn’t lose 
any aspect of our 
culture, 
because 

it really is who I 
am,” 
Manasvini 

Rao said.

She 
described 

her life speaking 
her mother tongue 
while 
growing 

up, eating Indian 
food, 
dressing 

in 
traditional 

clothing 
and 

celebrating 
national holidays. 
However, 
Rao 

said music was the 
easiest medium for 
her to talk about 
with 
relatives, 

especially 
her 

grandparents 
in 

India.

“For me the reason why 

roots are so important to stay 
connected with through Indian 
classical music and Michigan 
Sahana is because it’s the best 
way for me to keep a part of 
myself intact and not lose it in 
the business and craziness of 
school,” Rao said.

Balakrishnan 
echoed 

these 
sentiments 
of 
finding 

deeper 
connections 
with 

distant 
relatives 
through 

performance art. Balakrishnan’s 
grandparents played classical 
Indian instruments and sang as 
well.

“That 
is 
something 
I 

remember 
a 
lot 
from 
my 

childhood. Every weekend I 
would call up my grandma and 
sing a song for her,” she said.

“I’m Indian and we talk and 

have friends who are Indian, but 
at the same time, looking back 
at my culture, Indian classical 
music helped me do that because 
I don’t live in India and I don’t 
see the rest of my family,” she 
said.

There is something unifying 

and special about the medium 
of performance that allows for 
deeper connections to form — 
even with those who are not 
physically present to watch, like 
many of the members’ relatives 
still residing India. There is 
something in practicing an art 
form to achieve a perfection 
that doesn’t exist, and passing 
down this work ethic that seems 
to strengthen the bond within 
families.

“When talking about today’s 

climate, when so many people 
aren’t open to diversity and 
are saying things about illegal 
immigrants, 
I 
think 
a 
lot 

of that fostered by a lack of 
understanding of culture and 
people. By using the arts or 
poetry, I think we foster an 
emotional 
connection 
that’s 

deeper,” 
Manasvini 
said. 

“There’s more of an emotional 
connection, which is why I think 
organizations like ours can get 
such a multicultural audience 
to come to our shows because 
so many people can enjoy it, 
whether they understand it or 
not.”

And beyond the pure joy that 

is elicited from live performance, 
it becomes clear that Michigan 
Sahana cultivates a profound 
empathy — from encouraging its 
artists to look back to their own 
heritage 
and 
simultaneously 

looking to their present and 
future 
community. 
LSA 

sophomore Sunanda Adibhatla, a 
Sahana member, said connecting 
to her culture is important 
because it helps her stand out.

“Staying with your roots helps 

you explore other people’s roots 
and understand other cultures 
as well. It’s important to me 
because 
it’s 
something 
that 

makes me different,” she said. 
“Learning about my culture and 
my roots is a way for me to know 
more and also be able to teach 
more to other people if they’re 
interested and spread the beauty 
of Indian music.”

Pass the Cake: A look at 
food, family and being 
together when you’re not

STOCK/ DAILY

Good eating

Arts writer Arya Naidu reflects on her cultural & familial 
attachment to food and her family’s incomparable cooking

Sometime about 2006, my 

family started doing these 
semi-huge 
reunions. 
I 
say 

semi-huge because we’re kind 
of an overwhelming bunch. 
What we lack in number (and 
there are quite a few of us), we 
make up for in noise and pure 
dimension. I always think I’m 
tall until I get a crick in my 
neck from hugging my cousins. 
We’d pick the Fourth of July 
or Memorial Day — some 
extended weekend — and get 
together almost every year.

As it’s the middle of Middle 

America, a regional identity 
I’ve come to take a lot of pride 
in, my hometown of St. Louis 
was always our hub. The kids 
would stay in my parents’ 
house, and the wiser folks 

would be 10 minutes away at 
my grandparents’. As time 
passed, the location sometimes 
changed, but St. Louis has 
always been our center. My 
grandparents have been there 
for 
30-plus 
years, 
moving 

there from Detroit shortly 
after immigrating from India.

It was, and is, without fail, 

my favorite weekend of the 
year. All my cousins set up 
camp in my room; the half-
dozen of us stumbling over one 
another whenever someone 
did so much as try to stand 
up. Every inch of the floor 
was covered in makeshift beds 
and old blankets. Our guest 
room was empty, but it didn’t 
really matter. This one moved 
across the world and that one 
changed professions and the 
other two found a place in 
Texas — so, it didn’t matter. 
Right now, we were all home, 
here, and we wanted nothing 
more than to kick one another 
in our sleep and trip when we 
walked to the bathroom. And, 
of course, eat.

The only time we move as 

a unit is when food beckons. 
Loading into my mom’s car 
(I’m in the trunk. Again.), 

we make the trek to Nani’s 
kitchen. I’ve been calling my 
grandma “Nani” since I was a 
tyke, and, eventually, everyone 
else started calling her “Nani,” 
too. There’s power in being 
short, chubby and wild.

We smell the food before 

we get out of the car. The 
turmeric 
and 
homemade 

ginger-garlic paste wafts out 
to the driveway, and I see Nani 
around the side of the garage, 
picking 
curry 
leaves 
from 

her karivepaku plant in the 
garden. It’s the same scene, 
every year. Heck, she finds 
something to do with that 
plant every day.

Leaving our shoes outside 

the back door, we follow her 
into the house. My grandpa’s 
in the sunroom, munching on 
chakralu and reading the St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch. Nani’s 
already 
adding 
her 
leaves 

to the chicken. We disperse 
around the various kitchen 
cookie jars, most of them 
holding boondi and decade-
old caramel calcium chews. 
My uncle is peer-pressuring 
us to eat the papaya he just 
cut. Last year, it was jackfruit. 
It’s 
chaotic, 
and 
there’s 

pomegranate in my hair and 
it’s home.

My 
family 
is 
tethered 

together by this event, this 
sensation, this food. There are 
some cousins I’m not involved 
with for months at a time, too 
busy with our own schedules 
to keep up regular contact. 
But, always, in the weeks 
leading up to these fleeting 
holiday weekends, we’re all 
talking endlessly. About the 
chili chicken from last summer 
and the lamb Nani kept telling 
us was tofu and the mess we 
consistently make trying to 
help with the chapatis.

About the fifth year we 

all got together, we were 
celebrating Nani’s birthday, 
and we got a full sheet of 
ambrosia cake from Dierberg’s 
(a St. Louis grocery store). It’s 
a vanilla base, topped with 
fresh pineapples and kiwis 
and magic. My cousins and I 
have tried to find an ambrosia 
cake as good as the one at 
Dierberg’s, but it just doesn’t 
exist. This is a fact.

The evening of the big 

birthday dinner, we walked 
into the kitchen after dessert, 
and we see this leftover cake 
being 
dumped 
into 
giant 

Tupperware containers. My 
aunt, my mom, Nani — they’re 
taking spatulas to the slab, 
shoveling it into random bins. 
I repeat: spatulas.

That is, and always will be, 

the most I have ever laughed. 
Here we were: A bunch of 
entitled, oblivious, blissfully 

stuffed 
cousins, 
watching 

the best thing that has ever 
happened to us being dumped 
into vats. Something about 
the act was so bizarre yet felt 
oddly normal.

As a first-generation child, 

I’ve grown up with a little (a 
lot of) spice in my life. Seeing 
the 
Dierberg’s 
masterpiece 

turned into mushy mountains 
was the first time I think I 
realized just how much I took 
my culture for granted. This 
brazenness and warmth are 
pieces of my everyday life 
because 
they’re 
entwined 

with my vibrant, brash, South 
Indian family. This was almost 
four years ago, and we’re still 
giggling about it.

My 
family. 
They’re 
my 

favorite people in the world, 
and 
I 
say 
that 
without 

hesitation. That night with 

the cake, we stayed up until 
2 or 3 a.m., just gossiping and 
belly-laughing out of our food 
comas. And when we woke 
up, we went straight for our 
tubs of ambrosia. We’ve made 
the cake a staple at each get-
together since.

Almost every year turned 

into almost every other year, 
which 
turned 
into 
family 

weddings, or as often as we 
could. But I know that if, 
right now, at 11:29 p.m. on this 
rainy weekend night, I needed 
someone, anyone, from my 
family, they would get here 
as fast as they could. Even the 
ones a plane ride away.

We’re not just a bunch of 

hungry relatives. I mean, we 
are, but food is a currency of 
love for us. It’s what we’ve 
used to bring us back to one 
another. When words aren’t 
enough or time gaps get too big 
or some trivial kinfolk drama 
clouds our judgment, the food 
roots us. We share it with one 
another and create it for one 
another because it’s a way for

B-SIDE SECONDARY

us to be together, even when 
we’re not.

My grandmother’s cooking 

has become such a routine; it’s 
always there for us, whether 
that be in the form of dinner 
every night or the tea she brews 
at 3 p.m., every day. When 
something is so familiar, so 
normal, it’s easy to lose sight 
of what a blessing it is. I’ve 
lived 10 minutes away from 
my grandparents since I was 8, 
and now that I don’t anymore, 
I miss it. I miss them. So, I put 
on a pot of rice every now and 
then. I drink a cup of tea each 
afternoon.

Food 
has 
this 
incredible 

capacity to just let you be 
there, wherever “there” is for 
you. Eating is such a habitual 
practice. Eventually, concrete 
images and specific moments 
start attaching themselves to 
each meal. Every time I’m on 
my bed, curled up with a cup 
of Darjeeling, or I order a chai 

from Espresso, I’m with Nani, 
watching her do cryptograms 
and 
dip 
biscotti 
into 
her 

steaming mug. I’m helping my 
mom grate fresh ginger into the 
boiling milk on the stove. I’m 
532 miles away, but I’m there.

No matter where I am or 

what I’m eating, food always, 
always, always makes me think 
of my family. I think of what 
Nani cultivated for us in all her 
whizzing around the kitchen. 
Without her cardamom or chili 
peppers or whatever it is she 
does that makes everything 
taste so good, I don’t know what 
our relationships would be like. 
I don’t want to know.

I can’t tell Nani I’ve gone 

to a South Indian restaurant 
without her coyly asking, “You 
know mine is better, isn’t it?”

I always say yes, and it’s 

always true. I have a hunch 
that everyone in the family 
would agree because we’re 
always getting more than just a 

meal with Nani. We’re finding 
vignettes of her life in India 
and creating traditions and 
plunging into this feeling of 
home being able to exist inside 
of everyone.

If there’s one snapshot I’ll 

hold in my heart until the world 
stops 
spinning, 
it’s 
sitting 

around the wobbly wooden 
table in my mom’s sunroom, 
the morning after one of Nani’s 
feasts, and eating ambrosia 
cake for breakfast. It’s a scene 
we’ve set multiple times now, 
and it never gets old. We pull up 
extra chairs from the kitchen 
and dining room. There’s a 
pot of coffee brewing, which 
has already been emptied and 
restarted two or three times 
that morning. A dozen donuts 
from Dunkin’ are sitting on 
the kitchen table, because we 
obviously haven’t had enough 
sugar. In all its hectic glory, 
it’s warm and peaceful and 
dependable. It’s home.

My family is 

tethered together 
by this event, this 

sensation, this 

food

That night with 

the cake, we 
stayed up until 
2 or 3 a.m., just 
gossiping and 

belly-laughing out 
of our food comas

FILM NOTEBOOK

Me, Myself & Mel Brooks

A personal reflection on the significance of not just Mel 
but most Jewish cinema and actors in a Jewish girl’s life

I am like, really Jewish. At 

least that is what my friends 
tell me. I don’t know if it is 
my sizably Semitic nose or 
my affinity for bagels and lox 
or maybe just the everything 
about me. Setting stereotypical 
truths 
aside 
for 
now, 
my 

Jewishness has been endlessly 
present in my life. I have 
constantly been the resident 
Jew 
on 
matters 
regarding 

everything from the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict to Woody 
Allen’s credibility.

Every summer, for as long 

as I can remember, I went to 
my grandma’s little, ranch-
style house in Dayton, Ohio. 
On those sweltering August 
days, once we had gone to the 
Air Force museum one too 
many times or played all the 
Nintendo 64 our little thumbs 
could handle, we were left 
with limited options in terms 
of entertainment. Sitting on 
that shag orange carpet stained 
with memories and coffee, I was 
transported to a world where 
cowboys farted and Schwartz 
was not my best friend’s last 
name, 
but 
an 
all-powerful 

force. From “Spaceballs” to 
“Blazing 
Saddles” 
summers 

with Grandma proved to be 
a 
comedic 
adventure 
into 

the hilarious, Jewish world 
of Mel Brooks. Even before I 
knew what “Star Wars” was, 
I was watching my brothers 
watch that guy from “Honey 
I Shrunk the Kids” wearing a 
humorously large helmet and 
a small golden guru named 
Yogurt caring a whole awful lot 
about merchandising.

When 
we 
got 
sick 
of 

rewinding “Robin Hood: Men 
in Tights” and completed our 

own renditions of the self-
aware 
masterpiece, 
we 
set 

our sights on the pantheon of 
Jewish film, the holy grail of 
Semitic Cinema, the one, the 
only “The Frisco Kid.” If you 
haven’t seen it, you’re tacky 
and I hate you. For reference, 
the film stars Han Solo as a 
rough and tough cowboy and 
Willy Wonka as a Yiddish-
speaking Rabbi on a Western 

adventure of Clint Eastwood 
proportions; 
it 
doesn’t 
get 

any better than that. The film 
approached complex themes 
of the fish out of water and 
immigrant experience while 
creating 
dynamic 
character 

relationships with the perfect 
dose of good, old Jewish humor. 
When I think of “The Frisco 
Kid,” I think of my childhood, 
of those long, summer days at 

Grandma’s house and watching 
those classic movies on an 
ancient television screen while 
eating Spaghetti-O’s.

I am like, really Jewish. If 

that means I get excited about 
Yiddish-isms in “Seinfeld” or 
references to Jewish law in 
“Transparent” or the simple 
utterance of an “oy” from 
an exasperated goy, so be it. 
Sometimes it was little things, 
like when John Goodman’s 
Walter Sobchak in “The Big 
Lebowski” claims he doesn’t 
role on Shabbos or anytime a 
Yiddish phrase was uttered in 
“A Serious Man” (pretty much 
anything the Coen brothers 
do thrills me). But it was more 
than understanding what the 
filmmakers were trying to 
communicate about their own 
stories, but seeing my personal 
narrative within it.

I think I was six the first 

time I saw Tommy Pickles 
put on a yarmulke. Granted, it 
was the “Rugrats” Hanukkah 
special, but still, something 
about it made me see myself 
in that wise baby. I saw him 
as an extension of my life, my 
family, my experience. Perhaps 
that is why I am so drawn to 
Jewish film, it reminds me that 
I am not alone. If there was 
Jewish content projected onto 
the movie screen, there was no 
reason for me to be ashamed or 
embarrassed. It was almost like 
I was in on some inside joke 
that no one else understood. As 
if the filmmakers were telling a 
joke just to me in a secret kind 
of Jewish code.

Now I know why Jewish 

film is so important to me. 
That feeling of belonging I felt 
watching Mel Brooks and Gene 
Wilder and Barbara Streisand 
is no longer a mystery. It 
reminds me why I am proud of 
my identity, my heritage, my 
tradition, my Jewishness.

Composer Gabriela Lena Frank at work

Life outside a golden cage 
with Gabriela Lena Frank 

Acclaimed composer draws on her family’s rich, Peruvian 
heritage with a compelling personal compositional voice

To a certain extent, creation 

is, at its very core, a synthetic 
act. Not synthetic in the sense 
of artificiality or fakeness, but 
rather in the sense that the 
product of creation is nearly 
always one of synthesis, the 
coming together of disparate 
elements to form some greater, 
compounded 
whole. 
Artists, 

like all of us, wander through 
life picking up the scattered 
pieces 
of 
the 
things 
that 

come to form their identities, 
borrowing 
influences 
and 

welding 
ideas 
together 
in 

endless cycles of combination 
and fusion. In many artists, 
this manifests itself subtly, but 
for others it can take on a more 
overt appearance. For some, it’s 
as if they take up the mantle of 
synthesis as a kind of mission.

More than most, perhaps, 

the 
composer 
Gabriela 

Lena Frank personifies this 
particular ethic. Born in 1972 
in Berkeley, California, Frank 
came into being in a country 
(and city) that was flooded with 
the tumult surrounding the 
Vietnam War protest movement 
and humming with the residual 
energy of the ’60s. In a certain 
sense, she is the daughter 
of both immigrants and the 
optimism of that decade.

“My father was a graduate 

student at Cal, that’s why he 
went to Berkeley,” Frank said 
in an interview with the Daily. 
“He had just finished a stint in 
the Peace Corps, where he was 
stationed in Peru, where he met 
my mom.”

Frank’s father is a scholar 

of Mark Twain, her mother 
a stained glass artist and a 
Peruvian women of Chinese 
descent. The maternal facet 
of Frank’s heritage has had 
a profound influence on her 
musical work; however, the 
road to the complete blossoming 
of this cultural influence in her 
music was long and circuitous. 
Initially — though surrounded 
by culture and the arts through 
her family — Frank wasn’t even 
aware that she wanted to be a 
composer at all.

“I didn’t think I was going 

to be a professional musician. I 
didn’t think that was possible,” 
Frank said. “I thought music 
was something that you did 
for fun, and I didn’t know any 
professional 
musicians. 
The 

most professional musician I 
knew was my piano teacher, 
and she’s a wonderful lady, she’s 
in her 80s, she still teaches, but 
she’s a neighborhood piano 
teacher, she’s not concertizing 
on the road or doing something 
like that.”

But Frank’s early artistic 

and 
cultural 
influences 

ran deep, and started early. 

Unaware though she was of 
the professional music world, 
the roots of her future began 
to expand even during her 
childhood.

“We were always a creative 

family, one that was invested in 
reading literature, [consuming] 
art, and so that was a powerful 
influence,” Frank said. “My 
father had the presence of mind 
to get me started on a music 
instrument when I was quite 
young: I wasn’t quite five, but I 
was already drawn to the little 
spinet piano that was in the 
house. This despite the fact that 
I … was born with a moderate to 
profound hearing loss.”

Reduced 
hearing 

notwithstanding, 
Frank’s 

early 
affinity 
for 
music 

manifested itself in ways that 
were indicative of a curious 
and creative mind. Though 
still without an inkling that 
professional music making was 
a viable option, already in her 
youth Frank was practicing 
some of the same modes of 
creation that would later form 
the foundation of her career. 
Taking 
influence 
from 
the 

traditional 
music 
of 
South 

America that she heard during 
her youth, Frank would include 
folk music and Andean elements 
when improvising at the piano.

“Though I was playing what 

my piano teacher gave me, the 
usual diet of Clementi and 
Haydn, she also encouraged 
my experiments with mixing 
styles, 
just 
improvising 
on 

my own, making up my little 
songs,” Frank said. “I didn’t 
write anything down on paper, 
but I was already doing some 
semblance of what I do now 
professionally.”

Despite 
this, 
Frank’s 

knowledge of this aspect of 
her heritage was primarily 
secondhand, 
and 
what 

interactions 
she 
had 
with 

Peruvian music came mostly 
from recordings. This period of 
Frank’s life was also concurrent 
with Andean music’s increase 
in popularity in the United 
States and Europe, as the Canto 
nuevo 
and 
Nueva 
cancíon 

movements began to take hold 
internationally. 
Partly 
as 
a 

result of this, Frank began to 
see musicians who “looked a lot 
like (her) mom.”

“My awareness of Peruvian 

culture was from a distance, 
because we did not ever go to 
visit Peru,” Frank explained. 
“[Peru] was really in troubled 
times, particularly during the 
’80s, when Sendero Luminoso, 
the Shining Path, it was known 
as — a terrorist group inspired 
by Maoist philosophy — was 
really 
tearing 
the 
country 

apart. So we stayed away.”

As Frank grew up, receiving 

good grades in high school 
and “with an eye towards 

Russian studies” (as a result of 
the intense interest generated 
by 
Gorbachev’s 
perestroika 

and 
glasnost 
reforms, 
the 

fall of the Berlin Wall and 
the 
slow 
disintegration 
of 

the Iron Curtain during the 
’80s), the course of her life 
was permanently altered by a 
summer experience.

“I took a music program at the 

San Francisco Conservatory of 
Music over the summer before 
my last year in high school, 
and 
it 
changed 

my life, because 
I was exposed to 
this whole music 
world 
I 
didn’t 

know 
existed,” 

Frank said. “This 
idea of becoming 
a composer came 
to me right away. 
I 
didn’t 
know 

what that meant, 
or what it was 
like, but I had 
written my first 
piece 
down 
on 

paper, and heard 
it come to life at 
the hands of other 
kids my age and 
younger, and I was 
hooked, instantly. 
Instantly.”

Not long after, 

Frank was accepted to the 
music 
composition 
program 

at Rice University — a turn of 
events which Frank describes 
as “very lucky” — and began 
studying composition formally, 
a course of study that later 
brought her to the University 
of Michigan’s School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance, where she 
received 
her 
doctorate 
in 

2001. While at Michigan, she 
studied with current faculty 
member 
Michael 
Daugherty 

and former faculty members 
and 
Pulitzer 
prize-winning 

composers William Bolcom and 
Leslie Bassett. Frank, who in 
addition to composing is also 
a prodigious and Grammy-
nominated pianist, later went 
on to record the complete piano 
music of Bassett (who sadly 
died last year).

While 
working 
on 
her 

doctorate, 
Frank 
began 
to 

remember her love for South 
American 
folk 
music, 
and 

inspired by composers like the 
Hungarian Béla Bartók and the 
Argentinian Alberto Ginastera 
— who did similarly with their 
own cultures — started to 
combine elements of Andean 
music 
with 
her 
classical 

training, like she did as a child.

“I realized that I had found 

my mission,” Frank explained. 
“I wanted to, in a very general 
way, be as mestiza in my music 
as I was in my person: I’m 
multiracial, I’m multicultural, 
and 
I 
think 
that 
that’s 

something deeply American. 
I love my country, and I’m

surrounded 
by 
daughters 

and sons of immigrants that 
contribute and work hard — 
that was uppermost in my 
mind then, and in the course of 
recent events in our country it’s 
uppermost in my mind now. It’s 
something that has become more 
urgent in my work as a musician, 
not less so.”

According 
to 
Frank, 
the 

intervening 
years 
of 

study lacked some of the 
earlier and later Peruvian 

influence largely because she 
needed to build up her musical 
fundamentals. But following her 
exposure to the music of people 
like Bartók and Ginastera, she 
started to think about it again.

“I had so much to do before 

I even began to blend styles 
… Bartók and Ginastera are 
still heroes to me,” Frank said. 
“And I studied with another 
[composer who blended styles], 
William Bolcom at Michigan, 
who welded turn of the century 
American song and cabaret with 
ragtime and dixie and his own 
personal style. So it was a natural 
reawakening — I’m not even sure 
that awakening is quite the right 
term, it’s more that I had to focus 
on getting tools.”

During her doctoral studies 

and after deciding on her path, 
Frank began to delve deeper 
into her cultural roots, seeking 
out the musical traditions of 
Peru with vigor. At this time she 
started to travel to the South 
American 
country, 
bringing 

along her mother and getting to 
know a branch of her family that 
resides on the other side of the 
Earth’s curve.

“While I was at Michigan 

I 
found 
grants 
— 
because 

nobody goes to Latin America 
for 
classical 
music,” 
Frank 

explained. 
“Everybody 
goes 

to Europe, you go to Austria, 
Vienna, Paris — you don’t go 
to Ayacucho, you don’t go to 
Arequipa, you don’t go to Lima 
or these places in the Andes.”

Frank and her mother went to 

visit their Peruvian family, and 
through them Frank learned a 
tremendous amount about the 
traditions 
and 
repertoire 
of 

Andean music. Frank’s mother 

comes 
from 
a 

family of around 
14 
children, 

many of whom, 
of course, have 
children of their 
own. 
These 

aunts, 
uncles 

and cousins are 
the 
ones 
who 

helped 
Frank 

in her effort to 
reconnect to her 
familial past.

“My 
family 

likes 
to 
joke 

that 
in 
any 

town you’ll find 
someone 
we’re 

related 
to,” 

Frank 
related. 

“And that was 
really important 
to me, and it’s 

been really moving to hear 
their stories and to know their 
experiences, and to realize that 
I’m the outlier, I’m the wing of 
the family that went north to the 
United States, that’s half Jewish, 
and I’m a symphonic composer.”

During her trips, Frank would 

bus around the country with 
her cousins, going to festivals, 
concerts and dances. Her mother 
would 
come 
with 
her, 
and 

together she and Frank would 
see parts of the country that she 
had been too poor to see during 
the years before she immigrated 
to the United States.

“All my trips are a little bit of 

ethnomusicology, I guess, but it’s 
actually more personal and more 
creative and I get inspiration by 
the music I hear,” Frank said. “I 
often will suddenly recognize 
[something] even though I’ve 
never seen it before in Peru, and 
I know that I must have heard it 
when I was growing up, either 
on the LPs that my dad had that 
he brought over from Peru, or in 
a concert that musicians were 
giving, who were traveling from 
Peru or Bolivia and Ecuador.”

This aspect of her identity 

has become one of the foremost 
features 
of 
Frank’s 
music, 

a 
quality 
which 
she 
has 

consciously 
embraced: 
“My 

music often is like a travelogue.”

“When I realized, ‘Hey, this is 

something that I can do,’ it came 
as a very conscious choice on my 
part,” Frank said. “I thought it 
meant I would not have much of 
a career, to be honest … I thought 
that I would be maybe a well-
loved teacher somewhere.”

Now in the middle of a 

prosperous career, Frank has 
started 
to 
branch 
out 
into 

teaching, something which she 
had set aside for many years. Last 
year she founded an academy 
of music at her home, where 
she gathers together emerging 
composers for a summer of 
study. 
No 
longer 
living 
in 

Berkeley, Frank and her academy 
are located in the small town 
of Boonville, about two hours 
north of the San Francisco Bay 
area, where she hopes to foster 
a healthy artistic environment 
that will simultaneously enrich 
the musicians and the local 
community.

“It’s a very diverse crew, and 

my hope is to make each and every 
one of my composers strengthen 
their individual voices and their 
individual stories and to be able 
to craft a real income and a 
living from what they do,” Frank 
said. “[I also want] to try and 
have them become aware of, yes, 
working on their national and 
international profile and getting 
these great performances … but 
then also focusing on something 
extremely local, and trying to 
volunteer at the high school, 
with music, maybe an after 
school program, or any way 
that they can, because we’re 
not meant to be just stuck in a 
golden cage, we’re suppose to 
be out in the community, and it 
doesn’t mean that we’re less of 
a thinker or less of an artist for 
doing that.”

In its first year of existence, 

Frank’s 
academy 
drew 

composers 
from 
a 
variety 

of 
diverse 
backgrounds. 
On 

the 
academy’s 
first 
concert 

of premieres by the student 
composers, there was music by 
a Mexican-American composer, 
by 
a 
Polish 
and 
Chinese 

composer, an Irish composer and 
a Hawaiian composer, among 
others. To Frank, this element of 
diversity is extremely important.

“It 
was 
beautiful, 
really 

beautiful to see the different 
distinct American voices we 
have,” Frank said. “And they 
all had premieres, in this tiny 
little community, to a standing 
ovation in a packed house. It was 
really magical.”

Part 
of 
the 
uniqueness 

of Frank’s new academy is 
the 
extent 
of 
her 
personal 

involvement. Unlike many of 
summer 
festivals 
scattered 

across the globe, Frank’s festival 
opens up her own home to the 
students, and she is deeply 
involved in every aspect of the 
summer. Because of this, in 
its first year the academy was 
somewhat of an “under-the-
radar” affair, quite intentionally.

“First of all I was thinking, 

‘God, I don’t want to make 
this big announcement: What 
if I hate it, what if it takes too 
much time and I can’t make my 
deadlines?’ But you know, after 
the first session I was hooked,” 
Frank explained.

Each 
of 
the 
composers 

selected to participate in the 
academy was carefully selected, 
people who Frank had come 
across and been impressed by 
personally in some way.

“I hand picked everybody. 

There was no open call for 
scores,” 
Frank 
elaborated. 

“These were all composers that 
I had at least known something 
of, who I might have met briefly 
at one of my guest visits to their 
school, maybe heard just one 
piece of theirs. And I quietly just 
asked about them, were they of 
good character, were they going 
to work hard — after all, when 
it comes to Boonville, they’re 
coming to my house, I’m opening 
my home and opening my life to 
people, so I wanted to be careful 
about that.”

Moving into the future, the 

academy now has a website and 
is taking applications for its 
second year. Frank is interested 
in a broad variety of students, 
not just in terms of cultural 
background, but even diversity 
of age.

“[The program is for] anybody 

that 
considers 
themselves 

emerging,” Frank said. “You 
have a lot of people in their 40s, 
50s, 60s, who started composing 
not too long ago, and are just 
as much in need of a boost as 
those in their 20s. So I’m very 
open. I just need to see talent, 
a work ethic, good character… I 
think it’s a myth that you need 
to group together artists by 
different levels.”

Through it all, Frank’s hope is 

to foster strong and compelling 
compositional 
voices 
from 

each of her students. The final 
destination of all of Frank’s 
efforts remains to be seen, but the 
road to it runs through her roots. 
Her own unique compositional 
voice is essential to who she is 
today, a composer recognized 
internationally for her abilities 
and one of the leading voices 
for multiculturalism in music. 
She is a living example of how 
something old can go into the 
creation of the new: Despite the 
importance that her heritage 
and traditional Peruvian music 
plays in her work, each piece 
she writes is uniquely her own, 
reshaped and informed by the 
past but independent from it.

“[The 
Andean 
influence] 

changes just because it has to 
mix and blend with my psyche, 
which was formed here, was 
formed in the United States,” 
Frank said. “I’ve spent most 
of my time here, in my home 
country. For me, again, I feel 
like that’s very American. We 
bring in a lot of cultures, eat it 
up and make it into something 
new. We’ve been doing that for 
centuries.”

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Aaron West has had an incred-
ibly shitty time since the 
beginning of his fictional story. 
Between the loss of his father 
and a newborn daughter and 
the subsequent divorce that 
sent him into a tailspin, he’s 
all too familiar with crippling 
heartbreak. The story of Aaron 
West — a character breathed 
into life with 2014’s We Don’t 
Have Each Other — is the brain-
child of master songwriter Dan 
Campbell of The Wonder Years, 
who personifies the character in 
performance.
On his newest single, “Orchard 
Park,” we find West and his 
mother spreading his father’s 
ashes at the title’s location. We 
see him at his most somber, 
speaking directly to the memory 
of his father, trading in his char-
acteristic desperation with a 
sense of closure. Over his quietly 

reflective tune, West contem-
plates on the love of the Buffalo 
Bills he shares with his father, a 
common motif throughout his 
story. He sings in the chorus, 

“Come November when I’m 
screaming at my TV in the dark 
/ You’re screaming with me 
from Orchard Park.” It’s heart-
breaking in characteristic West 
fashion, but uncharacteristically 
comforting in the context of his 
story.

With “Orchard Park,” West 
breaks his typically linear time-
line, taking us back to the after-
math of his father’s death before 
his own breakdown. The song 
expertly relays West’s emotional 
state, with soft, steady guitar 
harmonies accompanied with 
violin provided by Yellowcard’s 
Sean Mackin. It’s melancholy 
and longing, but that’s in direct 
contrast to his usual help-
lessness, or even his steady 
rebuilding on his most recent 
EP, Bittersweet. As beautifully 
composed as “Orchard Park” is, 
it serves only to fill a small gap 
in West’s story. For now, we’ll be 
left a little more knowledgeable 
about West’s past, but in eager 
anticipation for him to pick up 
the story where he left off.

CWPS: Travel, art and 
the shaping of an identity

The Center for World Performance Studies provides a 
space to delve into rich performance traditions globally

Sometimes, you have to 

travel far to understand.

The 
Center 
for 
World 

Performance 
Studies 
is 
a 

multidisciplinary 
program 

that offers a certificate to 
graduate 
students. 
CWPS 

collaborates with the College 
of Literature, Science and 
the Arts, Rackham Graduate 
School 
and 
other 
schools 

within 
the 
University. 
It 

teaches its students how to 
engage in theoretical and 
aesthetic issues that stem 
beyond the performing arts. 
As part of the certificate, 
students 
receive 
funding 

to travel abroad to do their 
projects.

For graduate dance student 

Fabiola Torralba, the program 
allowed her to reconnect with 
her culture when she traveled 
back to Mexico. She went last 
summer to the region known 

as the Costa Chica, which 
encompasses 
Oaxaca 
and 

Guerrero. Not only did she 
visit her family, but she gained 
the opportunity to question 
more about her heritage. 

During this trip, she asked 

her 
grandmother, 
“What 

are we?” She remembered 
her 
grandmother 
saying, 

“We’re mestizos,” meaning 
of mixed race. After that, her 
grandmother was unsure of 
what to say.

“I do remember was what 

wasn’t said,” Torralba said. 
“I wondered, ‘What about my 
aunts and cousins who look 
black?’ — not knowing that 
there was a name or a way to 
identify that. There was no 
word that I knew of.”

Torralba later found out 

that there were articles and 
photographs 
covering 
the 

people in these communities 
of 
the 
coastal 
region 
of 

Mexico. From here, she was 
able to gain a sense of self-
identity 
that 
was 
lacking 

earlier.

“I 
think 
that 
as 
an 

undocumented 
immigrant 

growing up in the U.S., I 
didn’t have many models or 
many people to talk to about 
my experiences, and this was 
during the time before there 
was 
immigration 
reform, 

before it was a popular issue on 
a national level, before there 
was the word Dreamers,” 
Torralba said. “People didn’t 
really talk about immigrants 
in the years that I was 
growing up, so I looked to the 
stories of African-American 
experiences and slavery and 
colonialism. They anchored 
me in some way, and gave 
me something to familiarize 
myself with.”

Not only has this experience 

allowed Torralba to explore 
her culture, it allowed her to 
connect with other family 
members and teach them more 
about the heritage. When 
Torralba went to Mexico in 
the summer, her cousin, who 
is also a dance student, joined 
her.

“When my cousin first got 

off the bus ... she was stunned 
because it was the first time 
she saw so many people that 
were like her,” Torralba said.

The first time Torralba’s 

cousin heard the term “Afro-
Mexican” was through dance 
itself. By learning about the 
story of Afro Mexican dancing, 
her cousin was able to learn 
more about herself, Torralba 
said. 
This 
recognition 
of 

cultural diversity within art 
is what has been lacking in 
education.

“To 
me 
this 
is 
new 

information, 
but 
this 

community 
has 
been 

organizing for 30 years, and 
that kind of shows how out of 
touch or disconnected I have 
been, and we have been, in 
academia, and maybe in the 
US in general,” Torralba said.

Another 
important 

discovery Torralba made was 
the injustice the community 
has been facing. She realized 
they have been hiding their 
research, 
because 
outside 

artists have come, imposed 
their gains and left without 
ever coming back.

She hopes to give back to the 

community, as a researcher, 
a dancer and as a someone 
that 
is 
highly 
committed 

to social justice. Torralba 
believes that she should use 
her resources at the CWPS 
and the University, as well as 
her medium of art, as a way 
to develop relationships with 
these communities and raise 
awareness about the existence 
of these communities.

While the program allows 

students to travel back to places 
of their heritage, it also allows 
American students to explore 
other cultures. This can be 
an invaluable experience to 
students for their artwork and 
understanding of others.

“We try to foster a sense of 

finding roots,” said Michael 
Gould, Director of CWPS. “For 
example, it might not be a place 
of direct cultural connection, 
but if you have a connection 
to another culture, we give 
the opportunity for people to 
have a deeper experience in 
another culture.”

Gould himself lived in Japan 

for three years while playing 
for a band. The experience 
informed his art making, and 
he wants his students to be 
able to see the richness in art 
abroad we don’t always have 
in the U.S.

But 
sometimes, 
the 

complete opposite can happen 
too.

Professor Anita Gonzalez 

teaches classes in CWPS and 
heads the Global Theatre 
and Ethnic Studies minor. 
Through 
these 
programs, 

she has taken many students 
abroad.

“What I’ve learned from my 

international experiences is 
that when American students 
travel over to other places 
they learn more about their 
own cultural roots,” Gonzalez 
said. “Often they’ve been 
just caught up in their own 
lifestyles, 
and 
when 
they 

travel away, or go into another 

cultural 
community, 
they 

suddenly realize more about 
who they are and where they 
came from and how they’re 
connected to either race or 
geographical space, or even to 
a type of family.”

When Gonzalez wants to 

connect back to the Cuban 
grandfather she never met, she 
turns to writing. Eventually, 
she made her first trip to Cuba, 
which allowed her to finally 
see the place she has so often 
thought about.

“Sometimes going back and 

finding your roots can be a 
life-changing experience, as it 
helps you see where you came 
from,” Gonzalez said. “And 
sometimes it’s a frightening 
experience, because you see 
that you’ve already been living 
in another place for a while, so 
you don’t have the connection 
that you would like to have.”

The intersections of art 

and culture are fundamental 
for many in understanding 
and reconnecting to their 
cultural heritages. Just as we 
learn about others and their 
backgrounds in their artwork, 
we often also learn about 
ourselves.

this week’s destination:

Well, this is off to a promising start. There’s Mon-

golian throat singing, for one. But I really wish this 
had closed captions. I can’t even identify the language 
they’re speaking, let alone understand it. Oh wait, good 
ol’ Werner is translating for us now. That’s good. Man 
this singing is really fucking cool. I want to be able to 
do that. Those overtones, man. Also there’s like this 
banjo or something similar. That’s neat too. This lady 
in a white coat (not medical) is going on about like the 
earth and the foolishness of humanity. Something about 
a redeemer. I’m not really catching it all tbh. Oh my god, 
baked has churro ice cream. Update: it’s delicious.

“He thinks he’s jesus,” says baked.
This redeemer guy has some interesting things to 

say. Love thy neighbor, and all that, which honestly i 
can get behind. “I am the blood of the father, and I and 
the father are one.” That’s a bit more dubious. This all 
reminds me of the 19th century slavophile conception 
of the russian people as being uniquely religious, the 
true heirs of orthodoxy. This baptism honestly looks like 
child abuse to me.

I think I like gin less than i used to. Huh.
God, this choir is great. This is really cool. They’re 

just like a regular congregation tho. And they’re good. 
That’s neat.

This guy Yuri is introduced as a sorcerer and exorcist. 

That’s hardcore. This exorcism is really intense tho. 
Like, the screaming is kind of freaking me out.

I think i’ll just watch for a bit. There’s a bell ringer 

and I like it. Him. Man. Whatever. His parents probably 
were killed in the war or Stalin’s purges, he says. I sup-
pose it makes sense that he has found a form of solace in 
the ringing of the bells. Russian religious music is really 
nice. I think that’s the big take away.

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

So far I’ve seen two men crawl over a frozen lake and a man 
throat singing, what is going on?

Now we’re in a home and are witnessing an elaborate 
blessing of some sort over food. The person perform-

ing the blessing is a shaman. The family asked him to 

come so that they could ask which way to take their 

herd of cattle.

More throat singing by a frozen lake, this time 

with a banjo? This is fucking wild. I should be 
high for this.

There’s this man named The Redeemer who 

thinks he is some sort of Russian Jesus. “Man-
kind is headed straight towards the abyss” 
he says. “I am the word of the father, and the 
word of the father is one.” This dude really does 
think he’s Jesus.

A Russian Orthodox priest is cannonballing 

a baby into a pool of water. Child abuse?

There is an entire audience for an exorcism, 

and the women being performed on are scream-
ing, how are people watching this for entertain-
ment? Do they not Game of Thrones?

Yuri Yuri Yuri rings the bells. I think Kanye 

should sample this, the boys got rhythm.

It’s interesting that almost all of this mysticism 

in Russia takes place within Christianity. These 
traditions would seem so strange in any Western 
Christian community.

A woman just asked a stump to give her bones and 

muscles strength, I hope it works out for her.
I’m now much more motivated to visit Russia, almost 

exclusively so I can witness the throat singing in person. 

I would definitely recommend watching “Bells from the 

Deep,” one of the strangest films I’ve seen in years.

—JOSEPH FRALEY

Editor’s Note: Werner Herzog’s documentary, “Bells from the 

Deep: Faith and Superstition in Russia,” is a gripping documentary 
investigation of Russian mysticism, spanning all corners of the vast 

country. In it, Herzog explores self-proclaimed messiahs, centuries-old 
occultism and more — making for a rather memorable experience for 

our participating staffers, inebriated or otherwise. Enjoy.

 From there, she 
was able to gain 
a sense of self-

identity that was 

lacking earlier

“Sometimes going 
back and finding 
your roots can be 
a life-changing 
experience, as 
it helps you see 
where you came 

from”

Honestly, what the fuck is this? I was the one who had the gall to suggest this 

and all I wanna do is slap the shit out of myself. I take a swig of Buzzed’s 

gin because I don’t think one substance is enough to keep me at bay 

right now.

At times you have to admire Herzog’s inability to 

give very little shits about the content he creates. 

He’s just piecing together vignettes of people 

throat-singing and throwing water at 

each other while singing hymns. 

There’s no narrative here. It’s 

just as if he’s trying to grab 

you, the viewer, by your lapels 

while forcibly peeling open your eyes 

so you can witness the fuckery, good or 

bad (or anything in between), he happens to 

find on his global travails. Fuck you, Werner. I 

wish Klaus Kinski was here to bash your head in with 

a bottle.

This guy on the screen thinks he’s Jesus. He sort of looks 

like him too. Maybe if Christ turned water into meth instead, more 

accurately.

There’s a screaming baby being violently baptized. There’s a screaming 

woman being exorcised. There’s more throat singing. I’m too high for this shit. 

Goodnight.

MUSIC PROFILE

COURTESY OF THE LOTUS FESTIVAL

Lotus Festival shows what 
we gain from world music

International musicians and artists gathered in Bloomington for 
three days to share in individual culture and personal performance

In an ideal world, people 

would 
see 
something 
“like 

nothing 
they’ve 
ever 
seen 

before” on a regular basis. Some 
lucky people do. Sometimes 
the phenomenon is scheduled; 
sometimes 
it’s 
completely 

spontaneous.

In Bloomington, Ind., that 

awe is guaranteed at least once 
every year, one weekend in 
September.

This 
experience 
is 
the 

Lotus World Music & Arts 
Festival: a yearly tradition in 
Bloomington that brings in 
artists from all over the world 
and of all different genres 
for a spectacular weekend-
long experience. Lotus is well 
known for its variety. One of 
the popular acts this year was 
Making Movies, an Afro-Latin 
band that mixes the persistent, 
energetic 
beat 
of 
alt-rock 

with the rhythm of zapateado 
huasteco, a traditional dance 
form from Mexico. Performing 
at the same time as Making 
Movies 
was 

the Raya Brass 
Band, 
which 

specializes in — 
according to the 
festival schedule 
— “Balkan brass 
with 
an 
urban 

edge.” 
Earlier 

in 
the 
evening 

was 
Lo’Jo 

(“genre-bending 
French-North 
African-Gypsy mix”), and listed 
later on the program was Trio 
da Kali (“soulful Malian Mandé 
griot traditions”).

Lotus was established in 

1994, which makes it one of the 
oldest world music festivals 
in the country. Every year, 
more 
than 
12,000 
people 

congregate 
in 
Bloomington, 

where the festival is set up 
in the streets downtown. It’s 
situated 
primarily 
around 

the 
courthouse 
square: 
the 

intersections 
of 
Kirkwood, 

Walnut, College and 6th Street, 
blocking in the city courthouse. 
This square is the center of 
downtown and the heart of 
Bloomington, 
which 
is 
the 

college town home to Indiana 
University.

“I was excited to perform 

for a new audience that never 
saw 
me 
before,” 
Canadian-

Cuban singer-songwriter Alex 
Cuba said of Lotus in an email 
interview. “I look forward to 
[lifting] people’s spirits up ... 
and [making] them connect 
with 
beauty 
and 
happiness 

through the positive vibes of my 
songs.”

Cuba played Friday evening 

in 
First 
United 
Methodist 

Church, one of seven venues set 
up throughout downtown. All 
told, there were three churches, 
one historic theater, one club 

and two giant tents. The tents 
were set up on blocked-off 
streets, and had food, soda and 
locally brewed beer sold at their 
entrances.

“As a Cuban musician, it 

is possible that some of the 
Caribbean flavors are in my 
music,” Cuba said. “I don’t 
think of genres or styles when I 
do music. I just write the songs 
in whatever style they come 
to me and that’s how I record 
them. Music for me is above 
everything 
else 
freedom 
of 

expression.”

This was a sentiment that 

nearly everyone at Lotus seemed 
to share. The artists differed 
widely not only in terms of 
origin and genre, but also the 
energy level of their music. 
Some of the performances were 
high-energy and fast-paced, and 
some were slower and gentler, 
but equally invested with depth 
and emotion. This investment 
was 
the 
common 
thread 

between them — the profound 
care for the music and the 
passion of wanting to share it.

One band further on the 

high-energy 
side 
was 
De 

Temps Antan, a 
Canadian group 
that 
specializes 

in 
traditional 

Québécois folk.

“Fiddle music 

in 
Quebec 
is 

really 
lively 

music, 
full 
of 

joie 
de 
vivre,” 

said vocalist and 
fiddle 
player 

André 
Brunet. 

“We 
sing 
call-and-response 

songs, so it’s a lot of energy 
on stage, especially with the 
tapping we’re doing with our 

feet.”

The 
energy 
that 
Brunet 

and his two bandmates, Éric 
Beaudry and Pierre-Luc Dupuis, 
bring to the stage is nothing new 
to them. Growing up in Quebec, 
the three were long exposed 
to the roots of 
this 
“kitchen 

music,” 
which 

Brunet describes 
as “the sound of 
the kitchen, you 
know, the spirit of 
everyone.”

“The 

traditional music 
was 
there, 
so 

anytime 
of 
the 

year was a time to 
sing a song, to tap 
the feet, to take 
out the fiddle, the 
guitar, and sing,” 
Brunet said. “So 
we grew up there 
with the music 
and with the bands. I want to 
say the music is still a big part 
of us being here... It’s really a 
kitchen party where everyone 
is dancing and being part of 
the same big party. So this is 
what we create live on stage 
with different arrangements of 
traditional music.”

And he was right: everyone 

was 
dancing. 
This 
was 
a 

commonality 
that 
could 
be 

traced 
through 
the 
entire 

festival, but most particularly 
with the bands like De Temps 
Antan 
that 
played 
in 
the 

tents on the streets around 
the courthouse square. The 
audiences were made up of 
people of all ages, from children 
with their parents to high 
school and college students to 
older adults, and all of them 

LAURA DZUBAY

were smiling and dancing 
to the music. They weren’t 
dancing in the same way, but 
that hardly even mattered — 
to look at them, they were all 
dancing.

“Everywhere we’ve been on 

the planet, everyone has the 
same reaction,” Brunet said. 
“Because we sing in French, 
so they’re like, ‘Okay, what 
is that language? It’s French, 
but it’s not from France, it’s 
not from Louisiana — oh, it’s 
from Quebec, okay.’ After a 
while, they understand that 
... all of the words that we 
say go with the rhythm of the 
music.”

This 
could 
have 
been 

some sort of an illusion, but 
at Lotus, it really did come 
across like everybody was 
on the same page. During 
the 
half-hour-long 
breaks 

between 
shows, 
people 

got food and drinks, they 
checked out the arts tables set 
up on 6th Street and stopped 
to 
catch 
the 
enlivened 

performances 
of 
Indiana 

University’s 
Breakdance 

Club. Then they filed back 
into 
the 
tents, 
churches 

and other venues to see the 
artists, and even if they had 
never heard of or seen those 
artists before, they were still 
perfectly excited to be there 
and ready to dance.

“It’s really fun when we 

see those reactions,” Brunet 
said. “Some people would 
say to us, ‘Wow, I just forgot 
all 
my 
problems 
for 
an 

hour and a half during your 
show!’ So it makes us really 
happy, because it’s exactly 
the purpose of our music in 
Quebec — well, traditional 
music from every country 
on the planet. The main idea 
is to get everyone involved 
and play all together, and 

forget 
about 

what’s going on 
and just have 
a 
nice 
hour 

or two of fun. 
So 
it’s 
really 

nice to see the 
differences, but 
it’s more or less 
the same thing 
from place to 
place.”

Lotus 
is 
a 

great 
yearly 

experience for 
Bloomington, 
offering 
a 

weekend 
of 
fun 
and 

togetherness 

for the students and faculty of 
IU and for the rest of the city. 
However, it’s also a communal 
experience within a broader, 
international context. It’s the 
act of seeing people connect 
so genuinely to music that 
comes from so far away 
from them, whether that’s 
Chilean folk fusion, Tuvan 
throat-singing 
or 
Chinese 

guzheng. It’s like nothing 
you’ve ever seen before, and 
arguably nothing that you 
could encounter anywhere 
else. It’s an experience that 
makes the word “community” 
momentarily mean something 
bigger, 
something 
that 

goes beyond the city itself: 
something all-encompassing 
and belonging to nothing 
smaller than the world.
