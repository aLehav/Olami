For many students affiliated 

with Fraternity and Sorority 

Life across the U.S, a defining 

part of their experience is living 

in their chapter’s house. Many 

sororities even require members 

to live in their house for one year. 

However, with the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
decision 
to 

transition to winter recruitment 

this school year, many freshmen 

intending to join — and current 

members with obligations to fill 

their chapter’s house each year 

— are facing uncertainties about 

their housing situation for next 

year. 

Starting fall 2019, students 

must have completed at least 

12 credits at the University 

and 
be 
in 
good 
academic 

and 
behavioral 
standing 
to 

participate 
in 
fraternity 
or 

sorority recruitment, meaning 

incoming freshmen are unable 

to join the organizations during 

their first semester on campus. 

The 
University 
made 

the 
decision 
to 
transition 

recruitment 
to 
the 
winter 

last March as part of the 

University’s Diversity, Equity 

and Inclusion plan for first-year 

students. 
following 
previous 

Interfraternity 
Council 

suspension of all social activities 

for 
two 
months 
following 

several cases of alcohol abuse, 

as well as multiple hazing and 

sexual assault allegations. 

Only 
freshmen 
are 

guaranteed on-campus housing 

by the University, leaving the 

majority of upperclassmen to 

live off-campus. The increasing 

number of students struggling 

to find affordable housing close 

to campus has made the housing 

search more competitive, often 

pushing students to sign leases 

by October or November for the 

following year.

Imam 
Omar 
Suleiman, 
a 
Muslim activist and adjunct 
professor of Islamic Studies at 
Southern Methodist University, 
spoke to a crowded Rackham 
Auditorium Tuesday evening 
in a talk entitled “Malcolm & 
Martin: Intersecting Visions of 
Justice.” His lecture touched on 
the challenging legacies of the 

two Civil Rights Movement’s 
leaders and the ways in which 
their histories are sometimes 
distorted to fit a common 
narrative. 
The talk was hosted by 
the University of Michigan’s 
Muslim Students’ Association 
and included a post-lecture 
panel 
featuring 
associate 
professor 
of 
American 
Culture Su’ad Abdul Khabeer, 
and 
associate 
professor 
of 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies Stephen Ward. 
While 
Suleiman’s 
lecture 
remained rooted in the history 
of the civil rights movement 
and the dueling philosophies 
of Malcolm X’s, as well as 
Martin Luther King Jr.’s, he 
also discussed topics such as 
imperialism, the importance 
of religion and the demands of 
modern-day activism. 
Suleiman urged the audience 
to 
challenge 
themselves 
by 
not seeing the men’s legacies 

simply through the rigid lens of 
“violence” and “nonviolence,” 
but 
instead 
as 
complex 
ideologies that are still being 
interpreted and studied. He 
said a photo from Martin Luther 
King Jr.’s and Malcolm X’s first 
and only meeting on Capitol Hill 
in 1964 still “haunts” Americans 
because it represents a futile 
hope that compromise between 
these two leaders would one day 
prevail, though it never did.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

At 
Ann 
Arbor 
Friends 
Meeting, Ann Arbor residents 
gathered to hear a presentation 
on 
business 
corporations’ 
influence on democracy. The 
even was titled “We the People 
vs. Corporate Rule: It’s Up 
to Us” and was hosted by the 
Ann Arbor Friends Peace and 
Social Concerns Committee, 
Move to Amend and the 
Huron 
Valley 
Democratic 
Socialists of America. The 

venue 
featured 
Move 
to 
Amend’s Outreach Director 
Greg Coleridge, as well as 
three community activists. 
Move to Amend is an 
organization 
committed 
to 
building a movement that 
will lead to the passing of 
their 28th Amendment. The 
organization’s 
proposed 
bill 
would 
end 
corporate 
constitutional 
rights 
and 
make clear that money is not 
speech. 
Coleridge started his talk 
with the idea that, though it 

may seem corporations are 
the only influence on the U.S. 
democracy, it does not always 
have to be this way. He used 
a quotation from meditation 
teacher 
and 
author 
Sally 
Kempton, 
when 
speaking 
about how much of the battle 
is in peoples’ minds. 
“It’s hard to fight an enemy 
who has outposts in your 
head,” Coleridge said. “What 
Kempton was trying to get at 
is the dominant culture that 
defines today in our society 
… has so conditioned us into 

thinking that, when it comes 
to bringing about change, 
that’s sort of the arena that we 
can operate within.” 
Coleridge 
went 
through 
the 
extensive 
history 
of 
democracy 
in 
the 
U.S., 
highlighting 
the 
fact 
the 
country was originally meant 
to benefit white, male property 
owners. According to him, 
corporations 
have 
earned 
more rights than people as the 
country has progressed.

People 
for 
the 
Ethical 
Treatment of Animals issued 
a press release last week 
naming the University of 
Michigan as one of the “worst” 
universities 
for 
animal 
testing. PETA’s “Failed Tests: 
Campus 
Cruelty 
Report” 
investigated 
hundreds 
of 
universities 
across 
the 
country and ranked them as 
“bad,” “worse” and “worst.” 
PETA ranked U-M as one of 
the 93 schools categorized as 
“worst,” a distinction given 
to only about 14 percent of 
the 657 collges investigated. 
The 
scores 
were 
determined by a point system 
from 
three 
categories, 
which included the number 
of animals from regulated 
species held in a school’s labs 
and the level of funding from 
the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH), as well as the 
number and severity of USDA 
violations.
Under the federal Animal 
Welfare Act, only specific 
animals are required to be 
inventoried, 
while 
others, 
such as mice, rats and other 
small animals, are not.

Later fraternity, sorority recruitment 
causes housing confusion on campus

A 
group 
of 
Medicare 
stakeholders met at the Ann Arbor 
District Library Tuesday night to 
hear financial consultant Jae Oh, 
a University of Michigan alum, 
speak about his book “Maximize 
Your Medicare: Understanding 
Medicare, 
Protecting 
Your 
Health, and Minimizing Costs.” 
Oh walked attendees through 
the process of selecting a plan 
with Medicare and answered 
their individual health insurance 
questions.
Oh began by outlining common 
misconceptions 
regarding 
healthcare, 
one 
of 
which 
explained how he got involved in 
the field of study. He said people 
often conflate health insurance 
and healthcare, looking to doctors 
for advice on insurance policies 
when they deal with a completely 
different subject matter.
“Healthcare 
is 
the 
most 
confusing combination of your 
relationship with your doctor 
and hospital, your employer, 
insurance companies, politics,” 
Oh said.
Health insurance is a financial 
contract addressing cost, Oh said. 
He likened health insurance to a 
long-term investment, much like 
stocks and bonds.

The 
Office 
of 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 
Inclusion 
and 
University Housing hosted a 
grand reopening of the Cesar 
Chavez, Vicky Barner and 
Cousins Active Multi Ethnic 
Organization 
(CAMEO) 
multicultural 
lounges 
on 
Tuesday. Each lounge featured 
three speakers, and the Chavez 
event in Mosher-Jordan Hall 
drew in a crowd of around 50 
students.
Diversity 
and 
Inclusion 
Director 
Amanda 
McLittle 
said the remodeling is part of 
a DEI initiative to renovate 
all multicultural lounges by 
2021 in honor of the Trotter 
Center’s 
anniversary. 
She 
explained housing manages 
18 multicultural spaces; 16 
of which are multicultural 

lounges. In 2015, the University 
made 
a 
commitment 
to 
renovate all 16 of the lounges by 
2021. The even celebrated the 
lounges which were renovated 
over the summer. 
McLittle 
emphasized 
the 
importance of multicultural 
lounges, saying they provide 
a welcoming environment for 
minorities on campus.
“A 
multicultural 
lounge 
really 
celebrates 
different 
identities on campus and is 
meant to be a safe space for 
students 
of 
marginalized 
identities,” McLittle said. “So, 
the programming that happens 
in these lounges will focus 
on multicultural issues and 
topics.”
The first speaker, Senior 
Associate 
Director 
of 
University 
Housing 
Amir 
Baghdadchi, 
explained 
the 
lounge is dedicated to Chavez 

because he empowered people 
to become activists. 
“This celebrates the bold life 
of Cesar Chavez, right there, 
all around us, who fought for 
the rights of farm laborers,” 
Baghdadchi said. “But he did 
so much more than that. In 
being a champion of the rights 
of farmworkers, he became 
an icon of social change. 
He created a model, and his 
message fundamentally won 
empowerment. 
What 
that 
means is he showed us what 
happens when ordinary people 
who don’t feel powerful, who 
don’t identify as powerful, who 
aren’t powerful; if they get 
together and organize, if they 
focus their effort on one thing, 
then incredible change can 
happen.”
Baghdadchi also highlighted 
how all the words on the 
walls around the lounge are 
in 
Spanish 
with 
an 
English translation on 
the bottom, instead of 
the other way around. 
Baghdadchi said it helps 
emphasize 
the 
Latino 
community is the priority 
within the lounge. 
“Spanish comes first,” 
Baghdadchi said. “When 
you see that, you think, 
‘Brilliant idea,’ but it’s 
not an obvious one, and 
that is an idea that came 
from La Casa. They said, 
‘No, this should be a 
space on campus where 
Latino heritage comes 
first,’ and we made that 
happen.”
Public Health junior 
Ronnie 
Alvarez, 
lead 
director 
of 
La 
Casa, 
reflected on his journey 
in an interview with 
The 
Daily. 
He 
said 
he 
participated 
in 
workshops as a freshman 
where he felt welcome as 
a new student on campus 
and 
was 
inspired 
to 
become an activist. 
“I know, personally 

reflecting on my experience 
with this lounge, my freshman 
year I was part of the ALMA 
program, which is a welcome 
program for incoming Latino 
students, 
and 
our 
final 
reflection was actually in that 
lounge,” Alvarez said. “And it 
was very empowering because 
it was the end of the program, 
and that’s where we transition 
into becoming students at the 
University. And from there, 
there was a very empowering 
speech where they inspired 
the Latino community to be 
activists on campus.” 
Alvarez said it means a lot to 
him to see the new renovations 
and to have a place where the 
Latino community can come 
and feel safe. He also noted 
the University incorporated 
students’ ideas when designing 
the renovations. 
“I think they’re really nice,” 
Alvarez 
said. 
“Especially 
seeing how the lounge looked 
beforehand: the color scheme, 
the pictures, the figures. It 
all looks great. My favorite 
part about it is a lot of the 
community members in La 
Casa actually helped, the whole 
thing was very inclusive in 
terms of the planning process 
for designing this.”
He also emphasized the 
importance of having a physical 
space 
for 
marginalized 
communities on campus where 
they feel welcome. 
“I 
think 
multicultural 
lounges are one of the most 
tangible ways to show that 
certain 
communities 
are 
welcome on campus,” Alvarez 
said. “So, this is a physical 
space for you to feel welcome 
and represented. Also, DEI 
does a great job of that with 
these spaces. Even though I 
think there’s a lot of progress 
to be made, this is definitely a 
step in the right direction.”

Court allows intervention in suits

September 18, 2000
Two 
minority 
advocate 
groups will be allowed to serve as 
co-defendants in the admissions 
lawsuits 
facing 
two 
University 
schools as a result of a decision 
handed down by the Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati 
last month. The decision will delay 
the two lawsuits that are challenging 
the admissions processes of the 
University’s Law School and College 
of Literature,
Science and the Arts until next 
summer.
Miranda Massie, lead counsel for 
the defendants intervening in the 
suit facing the Law School, said the 
introduction of co-defendants is a 
significant victory.
“The attack on affirmative action 
can only prevail if the truth is not let 

into the courtroom,” Massie said. 
“We are elated. It is a historic turning 
point.”
The LSA suit is scheduled to begin 
some time next July or August, with 
the Law School case set to start Aug. 
28, 2000. The cases originally were 
scheduled to go to trial this fall. 
The 
Washington, 
D.C.-based 
Center for Individual Rights filed the 
lawsuits in 1997 on behalf of three 
white applicants, contending that 
using race as a factor in admissions 
is unfair.
LSA applicants Jennifer Gratz and 
Patrick Hamacher and Law School 
applicant Barbara Grutter claim they 
were unfairly denied admission, con- 
tending that less-qualified minority
applicants were admitted.
The court’s decision allowing the 
inclusion of intervening defendants 

marks the first time minority 
advocates will be permitted to have 
their interests directly addressed in 
an affirmative action case.
University 
Deputy 
General 
Counsel Liz Barry said trials were 
pushed back to allow the intervening 
defendants time to become fully 
acquainted with the cases.
“We welcome the intervenors 
because 
their 
point-of-view 
is 
relevant and important to the 
debate,” Barry said. “Clearly, they 
need time to adequately prepare.”
Barry said in order for the 
intervenors to be included, they had 
to prove that they had a legal interest 
in the cases and that they would 
not be adequately represented by 
the two parties already involved. 
The decision, which came more 
than a year after separate district 

judges denied previous requests for 
intervention, allows about 60 high 
school and undergraduate students 
to defend their interests in both 
the LSA and the Law School cases, 
respectively.
Godfrey Dillard, lead counsel 
for the intervening coalition in 
the LSA case, which is backed 
by several national and local 
organizations, 
including 
the 
National 
Association 
for 
the 
Advancement of Colored People 
and the American Civil Liberties 
Union, said the decision allows the 
real work to begin.
“Certainly we are happy with the 
decision, but it is a small step,” he 
said. “It opens the door for us to play 
a full and equal role in the case.”
Dillard 
said 
the 
attorneys 
representing 
the 
intervening 

defendants will now be allowed to 
interact with the judge in chambers 
and file motions. As defendants, the 
coalitions have the same rights as the 
University and the plaintiffs.
“We have not been intimately 
involved” before the decision, Dillard 
said, adding that the coalition has 
had to view the case as an observer 
and now needs to review information 
and cross examine witnesses.
Terry Pell. senior legal counsel 
for CIR, said the introduction of 
intervening defendants into the 
cases will not substantially affect the 
fundamental issue being challenged 
in the lawsuits - the
constitutionality of race in college 
admissions.
“Adding those issues will not 
subtract from the issue that is at the 
table,” Pell said.

In the interest of preventing 
further delay, Pell said CIR will not 
appeal the court’s ruling.
“We want to move forward,” he 
said.
Former 
U.S. 
President 
and 
University 
alum 
Gerald 
Ford 
supports the fight to preserve 
affirmative action. He wrote an 
opinion piece for the Aug. 8 edition 
of The New York Times backing the 
University’s defense of its admissions 
policies.
Ford wrote that an affirmative 
action “ban would scuttle Michigan’s 
current system one that takes into 
account nearly a dozen elements - 
race, economic standing, geographic 
origin, 
athletic 
and 
artistic 
achievement among them - to create 
the finest educational environment 
for all students.”

“The movement is greater 
than those two men, and, at 
the same time, the movement 
needed 
those 
two 
men,” 
Suleiman said. “And we often 
do ourselves a disservice by 
trying to create the perfect 
hero … that rises victorious 
above the rest and had the 
perfect 
diagnosis 
and 
the 
perfect role to play. And so, this 
is the picture that we come to … 
This is the picture that deeply 
haunts America.”
LSA freshman Salik Aslam 
attended 
Suleiman’s 
lecture 
and told The Daily after the 
talk that he found it interesting 
how people often create a 
singular portrayal of a public 
figure based on their defining 
moments when, in fact, their 
legacies 
are 
much 
more 
complex. 
“I 
liked 
the 
one 
point 
that (Suleiman) made about 
how they froze Malcolm X’s 
transformative moment … and 
they froze Martin Luther King 
at his ‘I have a dream’ speech,” 
Aslam said. “I realized that, 
when I thought about Martin 
Luther King, I had him frozen 
in that speech, too.”
Suleiman 
also 
challenged 
the common belief Malcolm X 
promoted violence among his 
supporters. He argued Malcolm 
X did not turn to violence 
because he believed it was 
convenient or desirable, but 
because he found it hypocritical 
that African Americans were 
urged to remain peaceful even 
when they were the subjects of 
continued violence and hatred 
for much of the nation’s history. 
“Malcolm 
said, 
‘I 
don’t 
favor 
violence,’” 
Suleiman 
said. “‘If we could bring about 
recognition and respect for our 

people by peaceful means, well 
and good. Everybody would like 
to reach (Malcolm’s) objectives 
peacefully. But I’m also a 
realist. And the only people in 
this country who are asked to 
be nonviolent are black people.’ 
And so, Malcolm’s point was 
the point that ... if you don’t 
have an established critique of 
the oppression, you don’t get to 
critique the resistance.”
In his lecture, Suleiman 
also 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
Americans 
to 
become 
uncomfortable 
with 
their 
history and their previously-
held beliefs about racism and 
the Civil Rights Movement 
in order to create tangible 
change. He related this need 
for discomfort with Executive 
Order 13769, also known as 
the 2017 Muslim Ban, arguing 
many 
Americans 
felt 
they 
couldn’t live with themselves 
knowing 
they 
tolerated 
a 
“blatant violation” of human 
rights with the Muslim Ban. 
“You 
cannot 
simply 
say 
this is not right, but you had 
to actually move to action,” 
Suleiman 
said. 
“Martin 
understood that America … had 
to be moved to a point where it 
had to be uncomfortable with 
itself.”
The 
post-lecture 
panel, 
featuring Abdul Khabeer and 
Ward, expanded upon some 
of Suleiman’s previous points 
and discussed their relation to

Abdul Khabeer said it is 
important 
to 
know 
where 
activists like Malcolm X and 
Martin Luther King Jr. came 
from and what perspectives 
they were originally exposed to 
in order to better understand 
their 
ideologies. 
She 
highlighted the international 
aspect of the Universal Negro 
Improvement 
Association, 

where Malcolm X’s parents 
were active members, to show 
Malcolm X’s philosophy did 
not exist in a vacuum and was a 
product of the environment he 
was raised in. 
“I 
think 
what’s 
always 
important 
to 
think 
about 
these people coming out of 
communities,” Abdul Khabeer 
said. “And, specifically, I was 
thinking about his parents 
… and their relationship to 
the UNIA as organizers and 
leaders in that group.”
Ward 
also 
touched 
on 
the idea of allyship, noting 
that white people who see 
themselves as allies should 
understand the ways racism 
has hurt society at large. 
“Rather than try to help 
black people or people of 
color, recognize that you too 
have been dehumanized by 
racism,” Ward said. “You too 
have been dehumanized — 
not in the same way, not to 
the same magnitude per se, 
but that your own humanity 
is corrupted. Acting against 
racism, 
against 
broader 
structures 
of 
oppression 
… you can see yourself as 
co-liberated.”
Suleiman 
echoed 
Ward’s 
point and added that in order 
to be an effective activist, you 
have to dedicate yourself to all 
aspects of a cause rather than 
support it half-heartedly.
“Activism is not showing up 
to 20 protests a year, copping 
a selfie and putting it on your 
social media with a really 
cool profile picture and a lot 
of hashtags,” Suleiman said. 
“Study one or two issues 
that you can really have a 
meaningful impact. Immerse 
yourself, learn from the issues, 
be present in other things that 
speak to your convictions. Be 
present. Show support. But 
immerse yourself deeply.”

doesn’t know if she should search 
for housing now or to wait until after 
the recruitment process is over next 
semester. 
“I’ve heard a lot of kids sign their 
leases first semester, so it worries me 
about like what if I drop (recruitment)?” 
Ceritano said. “Then it’s a concern 
for me to find a house to live in. But if 
I don’t (drop), it doesn’t really matter, 
because you live in your sorority house 
your sophomore year. It’s all just a bit 
concerning.”
Ceritano said she hasn’t heard 
anything 
from 
the 
Panhellenic 
Association, individual sororities, the 
Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life or 
University Housing regarding what she 
should do.
“No one has given any advice or 
anything,” Ceritano said. “I feel like it’d 
be good to have some advice on how to 
handle this from the housing office or 
maybe people who do leases. I don’t 
really know how to find it.”
LSA freshman Margaret Barber said 
she’s excited to begin the recruitment 
process at the University and would 
like to live in a sorority house. Barber 
said she intends to have a backup 
plan, but she’s not rushing into any big 
decisions. 
“I’m taking the time to adjust to 
everything, but I was thinking of trying 
to come up with a backup plan when 
my friends who aren’t rushing start 
researching (housing),” Barber said. “I 
could also research with them some 
possibilities if rush doesn’t work out. 
Right now, I don’t have any idea.”
Similar to Ceritano, Barber said 
many of her friends who plan to take 
part in recruitment don’t know what 
they will do yet. However, she claimed 
there’s been talk of a safety net for 
students who may, for any reason, 
drop out of the recruitment process or 
who do not get a bid from a sorority or 
fraternity. 
“It’s kind of up in the air,” Barber 
said. “But we had a bay-area Michigan 
send-off thing, and there were school 
housing coordinators talking to us, and 
one said that they would help us out 
if you plan on rushing and it doesn’t 
work out, that there’d still be housing 
available.” 
In a statement to The Daily, Nicole 
Banks, assistant dean of Students and 
interim director of Fraternity and 
Sorority Life, said the University’s office 
of Fraternity and Sorority Life has 
engaged with stakeholders inside and 
outside the University in anticipation 

of this shift. Banks explained there 
is a team of staff, students and 
representatives dedicated to finding 
housing for students interested in 
recruitment, all in collaboration with 
University Housing. 
“After 
extensive 
research 
and 
review of multiple years of data, the 
team concluded that there is ample 
availability of housing well into the 
winter semester,” Banks wrote. “The 
Dean of Students office will also 
provide support to students searching 
for housing and FSL is teaming up 
with the First Year Experience and the 
Beyond the Diag program to promote 
information about taking time to sign 
your lease, among other opportunities.”
FSL 
advised 
students 
against 
signing a lease preemptively. 
“If a student is interested in joining 
a fraternity or sorority with a housing 
requirement, they should wait to sign 
a lease until after recruitment has 
ended,” Banks wrote. 
Despite this advice, LSA junior 
Michael Smith, vice president of the 
fraternity Delta Tau Delta, explained 
most students usually sign their 
leases by November because available 
housing during the winter semester is 
typically limited, expensive or far from 
campus. 
If current freshmen decide to 

sign leases in the fall semester, Smith 
explained winter recruitment can 
cause problems for fraternities and 
sororities on campus that have come to 
rely on sophomore tenants to fill their 
chapter’s house. 
“The following year runs into 
complications because we can’t just 
have an empty house,” Smith said. “So, 
we have to have people living there 
more years than they were expecting, 
as juniors or seniors which has become 
uncustomary at Michigan, or we just 
have a severe lack of tenants.”
According to Smith, the Delta Tau 
Delta house is owned by a board of 
alumni that maintains the property. 
Without enough occupants in the 
house the chapter’s future could be 
jeopardized, Smith said. 
“Without a sufficient number of 
tenants, they don’t have the money to 
maintain the property,” Smith said. 
“Ultimately, that could result in our 
chapter losing its national charter, and 
just ceasing to exist on campus, because 
we’re not financially viable anymore.”
Interfraternity Council President 
and LSA junior Nick Wasik did not 
respond to requests for comment 
by time of publication. Panhellenic 
Association President and LSA senior 
Taylor Fegan declined to comment.

Therefore, 
violations 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
aforementioned animals are 
not required to be included 
in a school’s annual report 
to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture.
PETA used the amount 
of 
funding 
each 
school 
received from the NIH to 
estimate the budget of each 
laboratory and predict how 
many undocumented small 
animals 
the 
laboratory 
uses to experiment on. The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
received approximately $552 
million in funding from the 
NIH in 2018. 
The University reported 
zero violations in 2018, but 
PETA claims the ranking 
is 
valid 
through 
their 
independent 
investigation 
and the records they obtained 
from an unidentified source. 
“Records obtained by PETA 
reveal numerous incidents of 
neglect and incompetence in 
the university’s laboratories.”
Laboratories 
at 
the 
University 
are 
primarily 
investigated 
internally, 
therefore it is difficult to 
determine the validity of 
PETA’s 
claims 
without 
knowing exactly how their 
records were obtained. 
In the statement, PETA 
explained 
their 
findings 
regarding 
the 
University’s 
treatment of the animals used 
for testing.
“Painful tumors in mice 
weren’t adequately monitored 
and were allowed to develop 
past protocol limits, several 
mice died of dehydration when 
a water system malfunctioned 
and no one noticed, and 
numerous mice and rats died 
after 
experimenters 
failed 
to follow procedures used to 
prevent contamination during 
experimental 
surgeries,” 
the statement reads. “Living 
mice and rats were found in 
coolers after workers failed to 
ensure that the animals were 

dead before discarding their 
bodies.”
In 
regard 
to 
PETA’s 
allegations 
against 
the 
University, 
Mary 
Masson, 
director of public relations 
at Michigan Medicine, wrote 
in an email interview with 
The Daily the concerns were 
remedied.
“These 
issues 
were 
corrected immediately upon 
discovery by our animal care 
team,” Masson wrote. “In the 
interest of full transparency, 
the U-M also self-reported 
each event to the National 
Institute of Health’s Office of 
Laboratory Animal Welfare 
(OLAW) and our accrediting 
body, AAALAC International. 
Both OLAW and AAALAC 
reviewed these matters and 
found that U-M took all 
necessary steps to self-report 
and correct these isolated 
incidents.”
Additionally, 
PETA 
advocates for alternatives to 
animal testing, such as human 
tissue and cell-based research 
methods as well as computer 
simulations, claiming these 
methods 
provide 
equally 
applicable results.
“NIH has noted that 95% of 
all drugs that are shown to be 
safe and effective in animal 
tests fail in human trials 
because they don’t work or 
are dangerous,” PETA wrote 
in their report.
Jim Newman, director of 
strategic 
communications 
for Americans for Medical 
Progress, wrote in a statement 
to The Daily animal testing is 
both ethical and necessary. 
“Groups 
like 
PETA 
frequently 
claim 
that 
animal studies are no longer 
necessary,” Newman wrote. 
“This is simply not true. No 
alternative including tissue 
samples, organs-on-a-chip or 
computer models can mimic 
a living, breathing organism. 
Nor 
can 
any 
alternative 
fully mimic the countless 
diseases 
that 
can 
impact 
humans 
and 
animals. 
By 
suggesting otherwise, animal 
rights groups are ignoring 

basic facts and logic. More 
importantly, 
making 
these 
claims 
endangers 
public 
health 
because 
doing 
so 
causes well-meaning people 
to reject a crucial scientific 
method 
that 
saves 
both 
human and animal lives.” 
At the University, students 
have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
work 
in 
laboratories 
that 
perform 
animal 
testing. 
Students are required to go 
through 
numerous 
online 
and 
in-person 
trainings 
before they are permitted 
to 
participate 
in 
these 
laboratories. 
Johanna 
Buschhaus, 
Engineering Ph.D. candidate, 
has 
been 
working 
in 
laboratories at the University 
since she was a sophomore 
in high school and has been 
doing cancer research for 
four years involving mice and 
rats.
“My experience has been 
super positive,” Buschhaus 
said. “I have my own animals, 
so it’s really important to me 
that the animals I work with 
are never going to be hurting.”
Buschhaus also explained 
for the past year in her 
laboratory, they have had 
a veterinary resident also 
working to identify ways to 
improve the treatment of the 
animals. For example, once 
a tumor is discovered in a 
mouse, they are required to 
examine that mouse three 
times a week.
Ultimately, in the press 
release, PETA Senior Vice 
President Kathy Guillermo 
called students at U-M to 
action.
“Students live and work on 
university campuses for years 
without knowing that animals 
are being neglected, burned, 
poisoned, crippled, blinded, 
and tormented in a host of 
other ways right under their 
noses,” Guillermo said. “As 
the school year begins, PETA 
is asking caring University of 
Michigan students to speak 
out against the abuse of 
sensitive, sentient beings in 
their midst.”

“Corporate 
entities 
were successful at gaining 
personhood 
rights 
— 
constitutionally 
protected, 
inalienable rights,” Coleridge 
said. ‘“Only human beings 
should 
have 
inalienable 
rights.” 
He mentioned the court 
case Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. 
Mahon (1922), which found 
private property subject to 
public use if corporations 
deemed the land a loss of 
profits. He said the coal 
company was digging under 
people’s 
homes 
for 
oil, 
causing them to sink. Action 
was eventually taken, but did 
not go in favor of the people. 
“So there was a law passed 
that said, ‘you can’t dig 
where there are homes,’ and 

the coal company said ‘no, 
that potentially lost profits,’” 
Coleridge said. “‘And if you 
want those homes not to 
sink, then you have to give us 
just compensation for that.’” 
Recent 
University 
alum 
Hoai An Pham works with 
Planned 
Parenthood 
in 
Washtenaw 
County. 
She 
spoke regarding how the 
organization 
is 
trying 
to create an image of an 
unbiased healthcare center.
“Sometimes 
people 
only think that we’re an 
abortion clinic,” Pham said. 
“(We’re) reforming the idea 
of Planned Parenthood as 
just a healthcare clinic. As a 
healthcare center, we aren’t 
trying to politicize abortion, 
but 
abortion 
has 
been 
politicized for us.”
Pham asked how many 
audience members received 
their 
healthcare 
through 
their jobs, and the majority 

of audience members raised 
their hands. 
 “A lot of times corporations 
actually become the source 
of healthcare,” Pham said. 
“The issue with that is that, 
when you get healthcare 
from your job, if your getting 
good healthcare from your 
job, then you might have to 
stay in that, even if you don’t 
like it.” 
Meg

“Healthcare cost is the number 
one cost as you get older,” Oh said. 
“If you let it run out of control, 
I promise you, you can choose 
bond fund one versus bond fund 
two. It’s not going to matter in the 
scheme of things. The healthcare 
cost mismanagement is going to 
override everything else.”
Oh told attendees that if their 
financial advisors are not already 
aware of their long-term health 
considerations, they should be. 
Oh, who has consulted on a myriad 
of financial considerations, said 
health insurance is just another 
component.
According to Oh, most of 
the country is under-informed 
on the details of Medicare and 
he said anyone who believes 
Medicare does not affect them 
is overlooking the potential for 
increased premiums on their 
private plans when uninsured 
people 
walk 
out 
on 
their 
healthcare bills.
“Your neighbor just foreclosed 
on their house,” Oh said. “Guess 
what? It’s not only their problem 
now. It’s your problem. Why? 
Your house just dropped in value, 
like it or not. Just like (when 
people) don’t understand health 
insurance or leave an unpaid bill 
with a healthcare provider, guess 
who pays: the insured.”
The event featured a Q&A 
session, in which Oh answered 
specific 
questions 
addressing 
individuals’ 
Medicare 
experiences. He admitted the 

process is complicated and blamed 
the disjointed taxation processes 
which support Medicare and 
Medicaid separately as a reason 
why plans that work in European 
countries cannot work in the 
United States.
Oh 
also 
took 
issue 
with 
Americans’ 
dependence 
on 
the 
internet 
for 
Medicare 
explanation. He said much of 
what is posted online muddles 
definitions, spreads falsehoods 
and confuses even experts such 
as himself.
“We 
get 
hit 
with 
140 
characters, 
and 
suddenly 
everything goes to mush and 
the terms get wrongly used, and 
then you get biased parties using 
terms wrongly for their own 
design,” Oh said. “It’s easy to get 
confused, and you’ll get that over 
and over and over — on financial 
topics especially.”
Kalamazoo 
resident 
Diane 
Gregory 
attended 
the 
talk 
because of the confusion related 
to Medicare. She said her primary 
problem is with phone salesmen 
who try to convince her Medicare 
works a certain way — she has no 
idea if they’re telling the truth.
“I’m getting inundated by 
these calls, but I don’t answer any 
of them because they’re selling 
something, and it’s sort of like 
if you don’t know enough to be 
wary of those things, then any 
salesman can come and con you 
into something and tell you it’s 
the best thing for you when it’s 
not,” Gregory said.
Many 
people 
with 
Oh’s 
expertise 
charge 
hundreds 
of dollars an hour for private 

consulting. Oh said he speaks in 
public for free because he believes 
those who most need Medicare 
advice are those who cannot pay 
those consulting fees.
Oh 
implored 
audience 
members to take the information 
they learned and disseminate it 
within their own communities. 
He also provided attendees with 
links to a Facebook group and 
a Youtube channel for future 
reference and further detail.
“There’s resources for this 
information, and that marginal 
information is enormous to the 
people most in need,” Oh said. 
“And these exceptions are in their 
favor.”
Ann Arbor resident Rosemarie 
Russell said she came to hear Oh 
speak because she was curious 
about Medicare but wasn’t sure 
exactly which issues she needed 
guidance on. She said she felt far 
more informed about her options 
following the presentation.
“It 
helps 
us 
know 
what 
questions to ask,” Russell said. 
“You need a lot of information to 
know what questions to ask.”
Gregory, like Russell, said she 
appreciated the event because she 
learned a lot.
“He touched on a lot of good 
subjects which I think are of 
(importance) in a lot of people’s 
minds, but, like he said, you 
almost have to go to something 
like this to have that level of 
awareness be raised in your 
mind so that you do know to look 
further into it,” Gregory said.

T

his July, the Michigan 
Medicine hospitals were 
ranked first in the state of 
Michigan and 11th in the country 
by U.S. News and World Report. 
As a recent University of Michigan 
graduate, this makes me incredibly 
proud. We call ourselves the 
Leaders and the Best, and it seems 
others continue to recognize our 
excellence on many fronts as well. 
However, these rankings also make 
me frustrated. If Michigan has one 
of the best hospital systems in the 
country, then why was my most 
recent experience at the hospital 
spending 22 hours in a chair while 
in a psychological crisis?
As an incredibly stressed-out 
undergraduate at the University 
and a resident of Ann Arbor until 
2018, I was a frequent face at 
Psychiatric Emergency Services, 
almost always because of suicidal 
ideation. This specialty program 
behind the emergency room is 
meant to provide mental health 
crisis 
evaluations, 
treatment 
recommendations and screening 
for inpatient hospitalization. I’ve 
written before, in an effort to put 
a face to a psychiatric patient and 
reduce stigma, about how these 
countless PES visits and two 
hospitalizations helped stabilize my 
mental health. What I have written 
less about are some of the negative 
experiences that went along with 
being a patient.
To say I spent 22 hours in PES 
while already suicidal is not an 
exaggeration. I spent it sitting 
in an uncomfortable chair and 
had little contact with health 
professionals after the initial few 
hours of evaluation. The lights were 
constantly on, I was getting next 
to no sleep, and I was listening to 
House Hunters play on repeat until 
I felt so numb, I began begging 
to go home. This is not a unique 
experience. I’ve met and heard from 
countless others who spent similar 
spans of time, or longer — sometimes 
days — waiting in PES for a bed on a 

local inpatient unit, of which there is 
a nation-wide shortage. Doctors first 
and foremost take an oath to do no 
harm. How was this not harming my 
already fragile mental state? I could 
similarly talk of the time I was sent 
home from an inpatient stay with 
few resources besides a safety plan 
that I compliantly filled out without 
much else of a choice. I expressed 
with terror to my discharging nurse 
that I shouldn’t be sent home, only to 
almost attempt to take my life and 
end up back at PES a few hours later. 

Let me make this clear: I place 
little blame for my experiences on 
the doctors, nurses, social workers 
and other staff I interacted with at 
Michigan Medicine. They couldn’t 
conjure up more inpatient beds or 
create a more restful space in the 
PES waiting room. They were doing 
their best with the system, resources 
and training that existed. I do believe 
that their intentions were good, 
and at least most of them wanted 
the best for me. My point is that if 
Michigan is going to continue to lead 
as one of the best hospitals in the 
country, we need to lead in putting 
more resources into expanding and 
improving the quality of psychiatric 
services, and these changes need 
to be a priority. We need to expand 
and put beds in PES, so patients are 
not spending days waiting in a chair. 
We need to increase the number of 
inpatient psychiatric beds available, 
both statewide and nationally. We 
need to fortify discharge planning 
and resources, particularly for 
patients frequently going to PES, so 

others aren’t leaving feeling as lost 
as I did many times.
Michigan 
Medicine 
received 
national 
rankings 
(or 
high 
performing 
recognition 
for 
Rehabilitation) from U.S. World 
and News Report in every single 
department 
classified, 
except 
psychiatry. Michigan is eighth in 
urology, eighth in ophthalmology, 
10th in pulmonology and lung 
surgery, 13th in cardiology and heart 
surgery, 15th in geriatrics and the 
list goes on to include every other 
department compared. However, 
psychiatry is “not ranked” on a 
national level. That is a disgrace to 
our well-known name on a national 
and worldwide stage. 
The 
Michigan 
Medicine 
website states that “this is the 27th 
consecutive year that Michigan 
Medicine 
has 
been 
nationally 
recognized 
for 
strong 
across-
the-board performance.” Jeffrey 
Desmond, chief medical officer of 
Michigan Medicine, was quoted as 
saying, “Our priorities are providing 
the safest and highest quality of 
care to all our patients.” I can’t help 
but feel that a key field of medicine 
and a vulnerable sub-population 
of patients is missing or being 
forgotten in these statements.
At the end of the day, I am still a 
huge Michigan fan. I wear maize 
and blue with pride, cheer on the 
Wolverines on game days and look 
forward to visiting Ann Arbor again 
soon. I’m grateful for my time as a 
student there, though it was also 
filled with pain and difficult mental 
health issues. Importantly, I am 
doing much better now mentally, in 
part because of the staff I interacted 
with through Michigan Medicine. 
I love my alma mater, dearly, yet 
it’s because of this love that I want 
Michigan to do better.

Michigan Medicine is one of the best, and can do better

What Uncle Sam could learn from Johnny Canuck

MORGAN RONDINELLI | OP-ED

t’s 2:15 p.m. on a Tuesday in 
May, and most of Canada’s 
federal legislators have taken 
their seats in the House of Commons 
chamber. Geoff Regan, a member of 
Parliament for West Halifax, dressed 
in the barrister robes of the Speaker 
of the House of Commons, rises from 
his stately speaker chair at the end 
of the aisle dividing the governing 
Liberal Party from the minority 
opposition. “Oral questions,” Regan 
pronounces, 
before 
repeating 
himself in French. He yields the 
floor to Andrew Scheer, the leader 
of the Conservative Party and the 
Question Period is underway.
The controversy of the day is a 
scandal involving Mark Norman, 
a former vice admiral in the 
Royal Canadian Navy. Norman, 
of the Canadian military, was 
charged with a breach of trust in 
March 2019 for allegedly leaking 
sensitive 
information 
about 
a 
shipbuilding contract. For months, 
the Conservatives have accused 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 
administration of unjustly assailing 
Norman for the leak, and even of 
political interference as Norman’s 
case developed.
Scheer stands and looks across 
the aisle at Trudeau. “The prime 
minister has finally decided to 
answer some questions on the Mark 
Norman affair,” Scheer says with 
a smile. “He’s had plenty of time to 
rehearse the script and memorize 
the lines. What I’d like to know is ... 
why the government went through 
such efforts to prevent the truth 
from coming out.”
Scheer’s 
riled 
Conservative 
colleagues 
rise 
and 
applaud. 
Trudeau, who had been staring 
Scheer down during his diatribe, 
buttons his black blazer and prepares 
to speak. The prime minister then 
stands and, beginning his response, 
a chorus of Conservative heckling 
nearly drowns him out.
These raucous showdowns are 
a near-daily occurrence in Ottawa, 
and are even a cornerstone feature 
of Canadian democracy. But such 
a debate 700 miles south between 
Democrats and Republicans — 
much less U.S. House Speaker Pelosi 
and President Donald Trump — is 
almost unimaginable. A cause of this 
difference, of course, is the respective 
structures of the American and 
Canadian governments. Canada’s 
parliamentary 
system 
comes 
from the Westminster model that 
evolved in London, under which 

the leading party in the House of 
Commons — the equivalent to our 
House of Representatives — selects 
a member of its ranks to serve 
as prime minister. In this way, a 
parliamentary system intertwines 
executive and legislative functions, 
making the country’s head of 
government more responsible to the 
legislative branch.
Under 
the 
United 
States’s 
presidential system, the executive 
and 
legislative 
branches 
are 
independent 
by 
design. 
A 
presidential system has its merits, 
such as the right of a country’s 
constituents to vote directly for 
the chief executive — an ability not 
afforded by a parliamentary system. 
A glaring drawback, however, is 
that our legislative branch is far less 
able to readily hold the president 
accountable. The U.S. president is 
not required to listen and respond to 
the accusations of a hostile Congress. 
So why would he? In fact, the 
president only enters Congress once 
a year for the prepared State of the 
Union address and never responds 
to the questions and concerns of 
representatives. 
The consequences of having 
no forum for debate between the 
president and legislators include 
having less ways to hold America’s 
chief 
executive 
accountable 
to 
Congress and fewer observable 
interactions between our president 
and lawmakers. It’s a stark contrast 
to the Canadian Parliament, where 
the prime minister’s presence at 
Question Period is an expectation, 
and where Trudeau has been 
slammed for a poor attendance 
record in the past — which evidently 
means appearing a scant once or 
twice a week. 
It must be acknowledged, of 
course, that little legislative progress 
is actually made during Question 
Period. It’s more of a circuitous 
shouting match than anything 
productive, 
concedes 
Canadian 
news magazine Macleans’s Aaron 
Wherry, but it’s still “an essentially 
wonderful thing. Each afternoon, 
the government of the day must 
face the criticism and scrutiny of its 
nearest rivals in an open and only 
barely restrained public forum.” 
If nothing else, Question Period 
forces Canada’s leaders to engage 
each other on a daily basis, and its 
broadcast provides the Canadian 
public with constant insight into the 
political affairs of the day.
From 
my 
frequent 
summer 

visits to the public balcony above 
the Commons floor, “QP,” as my 
Canadian colleagues called it, 
seemed to be evidence of a robust 
and healthy democracy. I regretted 
that there was no American 
analogue, and more so that such an 
easily-implemented practice will 
likely never become a feature of 
our democracy. 
As it turns out, the idea of 
Congress hosting the president 
and cabinet members in a QP-style 
forum has historical precedent. “At 
various times,” details Matthew 
Glassman of the Congressional 
Research Service, “proposals have 
been offered by American scholars 
and public officials to increase 
the formal contact between the 
executive branch and Members 
of Congress.” Even as recently as 
2009, then-candidate for president 
Sen. John McCain stated he would 
“ask Congress to grant me the 
privilege of coming before both 
Houses to take questions and 
address criticism, much the same as 
the prime minister of Great Britain 
appears regularly before the House 
of Commons.” 
It is high time we revisit the 
question of Question Period. In 
March 2019, a Quinnipiac poll 
found that 65 percent of Americans 
feel Trump is not honest. Such 
a condemnation of our current 
president’s integrity, it seems, 
translates to a public desire for more 
executive accountability.
In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville 
praised 
American 
democracy 
and its “matchless Constitution.” 
We have long adhered to notions 
of American exceptionalism as 
articulated 
by 
de 
Tocqueville, 
forged by an enduring trust in the 
governmental system created by the 
Founding Fathers. This faith, while 
well-placed, has made Americans 
reluctant to introduce changes to 
our democracy — and, too often, 
we irresponsibly regard revision as 
unnecessary. In reality, we must be 
willing to borrow effective ideas in 
response to modern concerns.
After all, while de Tocqueville 
considered America exceptional, 
he also did not believe it was 
beyond reproach. “The greatness 
of America lies not in being more 
enlightened than any other nation,” 
de Tocqueville wrote, “but rather in 
her ability to repair her faults.”

Urge talks for peace, not politics
L

ast week, President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that 
peace talks with the Taliban were “dead,” putting a halt to 
nearly a year of conversations between the United States and the 
insurgent terrorist group. The proclamation came right after Trump 
revealed plans to have a secret meeting with Taliban leaders at the 
historic Camp David. The president claimed he ended these talks after 
the Taliban admitted to their role in an attack in Kabul, Afghanistan 
that killed at least 11 people, including one U.S. service member. This 
attack alone, he said, was enough to indicate that Taliban leaders do 
not “have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.”

However, this attack is far 
from the first indication that 
the 
Taliban 
has 
continued 
hostilities during negotiations. 
In fact, negotiations continued 
amid a spike in killings of 
both Afghan civilians and U.S. 
soldiers by the Taliban. Many 
of these have been substantially 
more deadly than the suicide 
attack in Kabul last week, 
suggesting 
that 
this 
event 
served more as an excuse than 
a reason to end negotiations. 
The sudden end of peace 
talks came with surprise as 
the U.S. Special Representative 
to 
Afghanistan, 
Zalmay 
Khalilzad, stated an agreement 
had been reached that was 
waiting to be finalized by 
Trump. This abrupt reversal 
casts doubt on the Trump 
administration’s motives for 
coming 
to 
the 
negotiation 
table in the first place. The 
hypothetical agreement allows 
Trump to fulfill a longstanding 
campaign promise to bring an 
end to the war in Afghanistan, 
satisfying his voter base as the 
2020 election looms around the 
corner. 
Moreover, 
canceling 
negotiations last week — two 
days before the anniversary 
of the 9/11 terrorist attacks — 
allowed 
the 
administration 
to demonstrate a superficial 
willingness 
to 
“stand 
up” 
against the Taliban and paint 
the insurgents as the true 
obstacle to peace.
Peace talks with the Taliban 
are one example of Trump 
exploiting political issues to 
maintain 
relevance, 
further 
his image and establish his 
legacy. 
Trump’s 
choice 
to 
announce an end to previously 
secret negotiations through a 
social media platform not only 
cheapens the issue but turns it 
into an open spectacle. Drawing 
attention and a following to his 
administration by dramatizing 

political decisions reflects a 
strategy that Trump has used 
repeatedly during the U.S.-
North Korea summit and the 
U.S. withdrawal from the Paris 
Climate 
Agreement. 
Trump 
follows a legacy of presidents 
who use political negotiations 
for personal gain and as a 
ploy, ultimately impeding the 
improvement of U.S. foreign 
policy. 
As part of a generation that 
grew up with the 18-year long 
conflict in Afghanistan, seeing 
yet another president use the 
promise of peace as a political 
gambit is frustrating. In 2003, 
President George W. Bush’s 
Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld announced an end to 
“major-combat,” even as NATO 
added 65,000 troops to the war-
torn country. Later, President 
Barack 
Obama 
promised 
to withdraw all troops by 
2014, but instead left nearly 
100,000 American soldiers in 
Afghanistan at the end of that 
year. As a longtime critic of the 
war in Afghanistan, Trump had 
said that his “original instinct 
was to pull out.” In fact, in 
February of 2019, American 
diplomats 
sat 
down 
with 
Taliban officials to begin one of 
the final rounds of negotiation. 
In the end, Trump’s cancellation 
of peace talks possibly lost him 
a rare opportunity to put an 
end to a conflict that continues 
to kill both U.S. troops and 
innocent civilians.
War 
is 
complex, 
and 
simply 
withdrawing 
our 
troops 
overnight 
without 
considering the ramifications 
would be irresponsible and 
potentially disastrous to the 
Afghan government, now that 
the 
Taliban 
controls 
about 
14.5 percent of the country’s 
territories (this excludes those 
territories currently contested). 
However, 
Afghanistan’s 

unstable 
government 
has 
long been the justification to 
prolong this conflict. President 
Bush stated in 2005 that the 
purpose of the war was to “help 
ensure 
Afghanistan’s 
long-
term security, democracy, and 
prosperity.” Yet, over a decade 
later, the Afghan democracy 
remains 
weak, 
flawed 
and 
corrupt. 
While the U.S. has long 
claimed to be a bearer of 
peace and democracy, much 
of 
Afghanistan 
political 
instability is a result of the 
Taliban’s influence and the 
continued occupation by the 
United States. Trump argues 
that simply leaving and giving 
the Taliban free reign would 
be a dramatic abdication of 
responsibility. 
However, 
if 
the U.S. should continue to 
act as a beacon of democracy, 
there needs to be substantive 
discussion about how the U.S. 
can rectify its past and current 
foreign 
policy 
decisions 
in 
Afghanistan. Actions like those 
made by Trump this past week 
do not accomplish this end. 
Moreover, the peace talks thus 
far have excluded the Afghan 
government. 
We recognize that the conflict 
in Afghanistan is complex, and 
our call to action requires a 
genuine commitment to peace. 
An essential first step to reviving 
peace talks is a re-evaluation of 
U.S. foreign policy decisions 
made in Afghanistan for the 
past 20 years. Simply coming to 
the table is not enough, and it is 
imperative for all parties to not 
only be included in the talks, 
but also be truly committed to 
ending the conflict to protect 
the lives of both U.S. troops 
and Afghan civilians. Hence, 
the Trump administration must 
prioritize the peace process 
rather than use it to for political 
capital and media attention.

I’ve spent a very small portion — albeit, 
the more blunderous part — of my life living 
in Ohio. (Please don’t punish me for that, the 
economy is hard.) When I was 16, I was with 
my father on the drive to school, listening 
to the early-morning talk radio program. 
They announced the “Thanksgiving Misery 
Index” in the news segment. The major news 
was that Ohio had been deemed the absolute 
worst state in which to spend Thanksgiving. 
This news was hilarious beyond measure. 
My dad and I cried from laughter. And then 
we stopped laughing. Because we realized 
where we were spending Thanksgiving that 
year: Ohio. 
This ultimately begs the question. Why 
do we despise Ohio? I am prepared to say 
something that may automatically revoke 
my Michigan residency: Ohio’s kind of not 
that bad. Listen, Ohio is certainly not good. 
But there are some (read: not many) lovely 
things in Ohio. Columbus is a genuinely nice 
city, with lots of wonderful sights; German 
Village is particularly pretty. Hocking Hills 
State Park and Cuyahoga Valley National 
Park are two truly beautiful instances of the 
Midwest’s most stunning natural splendor. 
The falls in Cuyahoga Valley National Park 
are full of such radiance and grandeur that 
I refuse to take them for granted. If nothing 
else, Ohio has at least produced a decent 
amount of corn (but, little known fact, they 
actually produce more soybeans).
Ohio is responsible for an absurd number 
of things. Rock ‘n’ roll finds its roots with 
Cleveland — where the Hall of Fame sits — 
because of disc jockey Alan Freed. It also has 
the Football Hall of Fame in Canton. Some 
notable Americans have called Ohio home, 
like Thomas Edison, filmmaker Steven 
Spielberg and the King of Flavortown, 
Guy Fieri. Ohio has produced at least six 
presidents. Even the Wright brothers were 
from Ohio, allowing Ohio to adopt the slogan 
“the Birthplace of Aviation” for their license 

plates. 21 astronauts have come from Ohio. 
Although, I think those two last facts just go 
to show the lengths people will go to get out 
of Ohio: At least 21 people have went to space 
because Ohio is that bad.
The true animosity with Ohio can be 
found in its absolute irrelevance to the rest 
of the country. For all the great things Ohio 
has given us, the state is not spectacular. It’s 
hardly even notable. Its greatest offense is 
its intense mediocrity. For the most part, it 
doesn’t matter, aside from strangely being 
a swing-state in presidential elections. It 
seems most people are confused on where 
Ohio even is. Lots of people get Ohio mixed 
up with Iowa, much to the dismay of Iowans. 
It’s a pretty average place, for the most part, 
with an unusual amount of tornado sirens 
and intensely hot summers. It touches the 
grossest of the Great Lakes, and isn’t really 
East or West geographically. Outside of the 
Appalachian part of the state, it’s fairly flat. 
Ohio simply is.
Yet, we hate it. It’s easily the most 
despised state in the Midwest. That’s saying 
something because Indiana is also part of 
the Midwest. And I don’t feel bad for hating 
Ohio. Cedar Point isn’t even that cool. The 
only thing you really need to know about 
Ohio is that Hell is real, and while most 
people think it’s in Michigan, it’s actually in 
Ohio.

Problem: I’m from Ohio

Contrary to popular belief, punks are some of the nicest people one 
could ever meet. This was at least true of those I found at this year’s 
iteration of Riot Fest in Chicago, as we celebrated the festival’s 15th 
anniversary with more diluted light beer than should exist and a whole lot 
of confetti. The first day of any festival is always slightly shaky at first — 
someone is looking out for something to go wrong, a band not to show up 
or the obligatory ferris wheel to shut down mid-cycle. But at Riot, nothing 
of the sort happened. Instead, a horde of people dressed in faded black 
jeans descended on Chicago’s Douglas Park to badly dance the night away 
together, screaming lyrics into the darkness as the city slept. 
The first act I stumbled upon that day was the Philadelphia rock outfit 
Thin Lips, who, incidentally, I had already seen this year in Ann Arbor. I 
had completely forgotten they were playing at the festival and had to check 
the lineup to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating from dehydration. But no, 
it was them ― and they were incredible. Vocalist Chrissy Tashjian held the 
audience captive with her soulful renditions of songs both old and new, 
showcasing the group’s new album Chosen Family while remembering 
their earlier work as well.
The crowd was a cheerful mix of people laughing and dancing in 
the afternoon sun. As Tashjian yelled “This one’s for the homos!” they 
erupted into applause. It was a delightful reminder of the acceptance 
and happiness that comes with much of the punk scene — for those who 
have found their own chosen family in the arms of the music they love 
and the people who come with it. Their set was predictably stellar, and the 
entire audience was jumping up and down by the time it came to an end. I 
couldn’t have imagined a more fantastic start to a fantastic day. 
From Thin Lips, myself and my lovely companion (and best friend from 
high school) Kendall walked to another stage, where we could hear the 
thumps of a pop bass line reverberating into the crowd. Following this 
catchy melody, we found Caroline Rose performing with everything she 
had in her, jumping across the stage in an all-red athletic getup, complete 
with headband. Both Rose and her backing band were some of the most 

frenetic performers I’ve ever seen, harnessing the energy of their excited 
crowd to create an environment of fun and frenzy. She sang most of her 
newest album Loner and threw in some well-loved oldies along the way. 
For a relatively new addition to the indie-pop-rock scene, the songwriter 
is remarkably self-aware of her own brand. She knows who her audience 
is, but most impressively, Rose really knows who she is. It’s a great thing to 
see from a young musician, and it shows in every song she writes. 
After dancing like a maniac to Rose’s set while carrying a five-pound 
camera, I was absolutely pooped. So we sat on the seemingly never-ending 
green grass of Douglas Park’s grounds, watching people go by. This was not 

Coachella, in any way — the biggest fashion statement I saw was someone 
wearing fishnets over their pants — but it was somehow better because of 
that. The aesthetic was not the point, after all, despite the common theme 
of black and red clothing across the festivalgoers. It was completely about 
the music, and enjoying it with everyone there. If places like Coachella 
and Lollapalooza are where the beautiful people get together, Riot Fest 
has been a place for misfits and punks alike for 15 very loud years. 
The dilly-dallying eventually came to a close, and I ran to get some 
prime photos of The Get Up Kids’ set. Every member of the band (including 

bassist Rob Pope, who I am still mad at for leaving Spoon) was on the top of 
their game, even so many years into playing together. They were a perfect 
mid-day experience to begin the second wind of the festival’s first day. 
Sure, the set was exciting, loud, the perfect place to lightly mosh without 
worrying if you would break your leg. But it was also evidence of The Get 
Up Kids’ time on the scene — they maintained the original stick-it-to-the-
man essence of their early work while getting even better at performing, 
creating a fun atmosphere that was grounded in real, tangible skills. 
Standing near the stage, I couldn’t help but slow-clap as their set came to 
an end. 
The highlight of the day, the piece-de-resistance of Riot Fest’s 
illustrious history, was when The Flaming Lips took the stage. After being 
on my feet all day, I was wary of how much I would be able to participate in 
the technicolor dreamscape of their performance, but who was I kidding. 
As soon as frontman Wayne Coyne took the stage, clad in a pure white 
suit and trademark halo of gray hair, it was like someone had gently tased 
me. I couldn’t stop smiling, to the point where my friend asked me if I was 
alright. The Lips (or Flips, as affectionate fans call them) were a force of 
nature, and the perfect ending to the first day of the festival. Between 
cannons of confetti, a giant blow-up robot and every band member 
wearing some sort of rainbow garb, everyone around me was having the 
time of their life. At one point, Coyne zipped himself into a plastic bubble 
and was thrust into the audience in a futuristic crowd-surf. I couldn’t 
believe my eyes. 
The group played the entirety of their 2002 magnum opus Yoshimi 
Battles the Pink Robots with the flair and intensity as if they had just 
released it. In addition to these songs, Coyne took a moment to remember 
indie legend Daniel Johnston by singing his most pure, strikingly true 
song “True Love Will Find You In The End.” By the end of it, tears were 
streaming down my face. The admiration and love in the frontman’s 
rendition was that of someone who had lost a close friend, and everyone in 
the audience could feel it. The set continued in a similar fashion, until the 
very last song. From hundreds of people away, it felt like they were singing 
to every person there individually, celebrating the night and everyone who 
had gathered there one by one. If there’s anything Riot Fest is perfect for, 
it’s that — that you can find people just like you, no matter how weird you 
are.

“Gloria, you crawled up on your cross/
Gloria, you made us sit and watch,” sing 
The Lumineers, weaving the tragic, all 
too-human tale of a family who lost their 
loved ones to addiction. Gritty, authentic, 
vulnerable — that’s The Lumineers’s new 
album, III, in a nutshell. Holding on to the 
familiar folksy f lair of their earlier music, 
III would appear nothing too special. It’s 
the underlying thematic discussion of the 
darker side of human vulnerability that 
adds the “wow factor” to the album. A 
stark contrast to the band’s cheerful first 
hit, “Hi-Ho,” III welcomes a more mature, 
more honest version of The Lumineers. 
Drawing from their personal experience, 
the band explores not only how addiction 
harms the individual, but more so how 
addiction destroys the collective. The 
album is structured in three parts, with 
three songs per part (and an added three 
bonus songs). Before the music even begins, 
the recurrence of the number three already 
steeps the album in symbolism, drawing 
from religious connotations, to the three 
stages of life, a beginning, middle and 
end. The progression of each track builds 
off the previous one, branching through a 
family marred by addiction. The broken-
down structure helps to emphasize these 
core themes. Addiction is like an infection, 
spreading from person to person, loved one 
to loved one, until the entire world is lost 
in the haze. 
Part one of the record follows two women 
who struggle with addiction. The first 
song, “Donna,” explores the archetype of 
the mother. A mother is someone who cares 
for others, who is a pillar of the family. Yet, 
the roles of mother and child are switched 
in this case. “Hold my hand now, time to / 
Go to bed, it’s way too late,” The Lumineers 
sing as Donna’s addiction drafts her into 
the role of the child, and her unnamed 
child becomes the caregiver. “Gloria” 
also explores the warped relationship 
between parent and child under the weight 
of addiction, the verses sung by the child 
and the chorus sung by the mother, Gloria. 
Gloria sings “Did you know me when I was 

younger then?/I could take the whole world 
then,” emphasizing how addiction can 
steal away an identity, a life. Yet, despite 
the tragedy of part one — which captures 
the descent into addiction’s stormy waters 
— the classic high-energ y feel of The 
Lumineers simultaneously uplifts the song, 
added a vague sense of hope.
Part two and three continue to build on 
the rest of the album’s themes, emphasizing 
especially how addiction is often cyclical 
in nature, moving through generations. 
The song “Jimmy Sparks” conveys this the 
best, spinning a tale of a father who falls 
to gambling in order to care for his son. 
Throughout the song, the father advises 
his son that “It’s us or them,” ignoring the 
helpless in favor of helping only himself. 
Yet, by the song’s final notes, the full circle 
comes to a close, with the son driving past 
his homeless, penniless father begging 
by the road, echoing “’Cause it’s us or 
them/‘Cause it’s me or him.” 
At the end of the day, The Lumineers’ 
III finds its greatest strength in its 
relevance. At a time when the opioid 
crisis still ravages America, e-cigarettes 
dangerously beckon the young and drugs 
continue to remain an inevitable part of 
growing up American, this spotlight on 
the complexities and enduring poison of 
addiction is vital. Listen to III, first for its 
authentic, classic folk songs and brand of 
charm, second for the lesson it can teach 
us — a lesson learned never too early and 
never too late.

‘III’ proves strong & sweet

“Amadeus,” the 1984 film directed by Miloš Forman 
starring Tom Hulce as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and 
F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri, recounts the 
interesting life of Mozart and his complex relationship 
with Antonio Salieri.
There was a nostalgic excitement present as I waited 
in line, hearing mumurs of “I haven’t seen it since it was 
in theaters” and “You’re going to really enjoy it.” Only, 
this nostalgia was unfamiliar to me; I had not seen the 
film prior to this unique showing, but it would fail to 
interfere with the experience.
After a brief word from UMS president Matthew 
VanBesien on the relevance and inf luence of the film 
in musical society, the film began with the Detroit 
Symphony Orchestra and the UMS Choral Union playing 
along to the film.
I was unsure if the soundtrack was accurate to the 
original film or if the Detroit Symphony Orchestra 
or its Music Director Laureate, Leonard Slatkin, had 
put an individualistic spin on the score. Provoked by 
curiosity, I spoke with an audience member by the name 
of Alexandria who had seen the film in the past. She told 
me that the score was exactly the same as the original 
soundtrack from 1984.
I learned that the Detroit Symphony Orchestra has 
performed shows like this in the past at the University, 
with one of their most recent being the live performance 
of the soundtrack to “2001: Space Odyssey” in Sept. 
2018. I noticed that despite my sitting very close to 
the orchestra, I was more focused on the film than the 
musical performance, which is perhaps the goal of such 
an event. As such, the work from DSO and the UMS 
Choral Union was secondary to the film itself, though I 
am curious if my fellow audience members who had seen 

the film in the past felt similarly or not.
Even so, the live musical accompaniment made the 
film come to life. The orchestra and choirs fell into 
perfect synchronization with the film, in a seamless 
transition from on-screen to real-world that I had never 
experienced.
As the film progressed, it was interesting to hear the 
audience of Hill Auditorium erupt with laughter amid 
a contemporary, classical score. There were admittedly 
some niche classical music jokes that went over my head. 
I enjoyed the film, although it felt as if I had infiltrated 
a cultish meeting of “Amadeus” fans.
The most poignant aspect of the night came during the 
end credits. As the screen faded to black, the orchestra 
began the piece of music that accompanies the rolling 
credits, but no one in the audience got up to leave. We 
all sat still, with our attention completely focused on 
the orchestra for the first time of the night, taking in 
their grand finale of sorts as they closed out the life and 
legacy of Mozart.

The orchestra and choirs fell 
into perfect synchronization 
with the film, in a seamless 
transition from on-screen to 
real-world that I had never 
experienced

I’m always somewhat wary whenever I learn 
that a novel I’ve read is to be adapted to the 
screen, especially when the novel in question 
is one I hold very close to my heart. I always 
believed that “The Goldfinch,” Donna Tartt’s 
brilliant and incredibly popular 2013 Pulitzer 
Prize-winning novel, was too introspective 
a tale to visualize, too contained within its 
protagonist’s head to tell through any medium 
other than prose. How does one possibly do 
justice to a 700+-page book that spans decades 
and continents, within the duration of a single 
feature film? 
“The Goldfinch” movie is proof that you 
can’t. Or, at least, director John Crowley 
(“Brooklyn”) couldn’t. Though the film stays 
faithful to the events of the novel, in the 
process it strips the book of precisely what 
made all 771 pages of it worth reading in the 
first place — complex character relationships, 
a captivating, sympathetic narrative voice and, 
perhaps most importantly, a story so immense, 
so unforgettable it might just be one of the 21st 
century’s great coming-of-age odysseys. 
“The Goldfinch” is the story of Theo 
Decker, a 13-year-old New Yorker whose life 
is torn apart after he loses his mom in an 
art museum explosion. Theo emerges from 
the wreckage with the original copy of Carel 
Fabritius’s “The Goldfinch.” From then on, 
the plot carries Theo from New York to Las 
Vegas to Amsterdam, where he meets new 
people who alter the course of his life. Yet, 
despite all of his movement, everything 
always comes back to this painting, this little 
bird, both Theo’s greatest burden and greatest 
treasure, a reminder of both his crime and 
the last time he saw his mother. Theo’s love 
for his mother and struggle to recover from 
her loss is unquestionably the heart of the 
novel, the thing that keeps it beating on, the 
thing that motivates every single thing Theo 
does. And the painting is the manifestation of 
that feeling. Even when the painting is not at 
the forefront of the story, it is always, always 
there. 
The movie appears to have forgotten this. In 
fact, it hardly feels like the painting and all it 

represents is present at all. The movie touches 
on everything that happens after the explosion, 
but fails to adequately emphasize the lasting 
power of Theo’s grief, which in many ways 
is a central point of the story. Young Theo, 
played by Oakes Fegley (“Pete’s Dragon”), does 
the best he can, but the script simply doesn’t 
give him enough room to properly emote. The 
parts of the film led by Ansel Elgort (“Baby 
Driver”) as an older Theo are significantly 
weaker in expressing the character’s anguish, 
largely because of the script’s heavy reliance 
on cringeworthy exposition, where the movie 
literally tells us how Theo feels, instead of 
showing it as a visual medium should. 
If 
anything 
could 
have 
saved 
“The 
Goldfinch,” it would have been its cast. 
Led by Ansel Elgort, Nicole Kidman (“Boy 
Erased”), Sarah Paulson (“American Crime 
Story”) and Jeffrey Wright (“Westworld”), the 
performances at the very least should have 
been excellent. Yet, no one shines — whether 
due to the weakness of the script or the 
actors I still can’t tell. Certain performances, 
particularly Finn Wolfhard (“It”) as Boris 
and Luke Wilson as Theo’s dad (“The Royal 
Tenenbaums”) are laughable.
“The Goldfinch” is a disappointment in 
every respect, both as an adaptation and a 
standalone film. Its director has turned a 
richly moving epic into a glorified Lifetime 
made-for-TV movie. My advice? Skip the film 
and read the book instead.

‘The Goldfinch’ disappoints

FILM REVIEW

As soon as you enter the UMMA’s “Copies 
and Invention In East Asia” exhibit, you 
are greeted by a quote from Japanese 
literary critic, Hideo Kobayashi: “Copying 
is the mother of creation. It is the only and 
true mother.” Oftentimes, the importance 
of originality hovers over the conscience 
of any creator. As creators, we can’t bear to 
imagine the embarrassment we would face 
if we were exposed for stealing another’s 
idea. We feel proud when an idea that 
we deem original floats into our minds. 
However, after attending a conversation 
led by Kevin Carr, Associate Professor of 
Japanese Art History at the University and 
specialist of Buddhist art, I walked away 
with a different perspective on originality. 
This exhibit is focused on copying. 
Where I had originally thought of it as 
a cheap means of creating art, I now 
recognize it to be a tool for passing down 
traditions. 
In Buddhism specifically, the act of 
producing copies holds a special meaning. 
According to the UMMA’s website, “From 
simply reciting and rewriting Buddha’s 
teachings to creating multiple images 
of sacred Buddhist figures, objects and 
texts, or the commissioning of one million 
pagodas, copying served to increase karmic 
merit, guaranteeing a better afterlife and 
eventually leading to enlightenment.” 
Our tour guide, Kevin Carr, was nothing 
short of fantastic. His knowledge was 
expansive; he was able to answer all of 
the audiences questions with ease and 
poise. His lighthearted sense of humor 
and enthusiastic speaking voice made his 
presentation all the more enjoyable. It was 
truly a pleasure to be able to learn from 
him. 
However, the event didn’t seem to 
be marketable to the students. The two 

friends I went with and I were the youngest 
in attendance by about 20 years. 
Among the artifacts discussed were the 
Pagodas. A pagoda is a tiered tower with 
multiple eaves. The pagodas on display 
at the UMMA were less than a foot tall. 
Pagodas were traditionally built as stupa 
in ancient India and further developed 
in East Asia. They were built to have 
a 
religious 
function, 
most 
commonly 
Buddhist, and were used during worship. 
The mass production of the pagoda 
made it a popular tool that has carried on 
through generations. The pagodas serve to 
amplify Buddha’s presence in homes across 
the world. Carr mentioned that it was 
popularized during the eighth century, and 
the museum showed examples from the 
20th century as well as the 21st century. 
The examples of pagodas from the 21st 
century were being made with a 3D printer 
right in front of our eyes. This highlighted 
the overall theme of the exhibit: the 
importance of copying and multiplication. 
It was also very interesting to witness 
the mass production of the pagodas being 
down in person. It made the history we 
were discussing seem all the more real. 
It is because of the copying of pagodas 
that the towers are still used as tools of 
worship today. Similar to the Buddhist 
missionaries spreading the ideas of the 
Buddha, the copying of art becomes an 
act of imaginative interpretation that 
serves as the foundation for many cultural 
traditions. 
Featuring more than one hundred objects 
spanning from ancient to contemporary 
times, the work curated at the UMMA 
allowed me to reflect on the creativity 
that lies within copying. Not only would 
I recommend this exhibit to anyone 
interested in learning more about East 
Asian culture but I’d recommend it to any 
creator looking for the value in creations 
that aren’t original.

Wednesday, September 18, 2019 — 7A

In the 11th minute of the 
Michigan men’s soccer team’s 
match against Oakland, spectators 
saw graduate transfer forward 
Nebojsa Popovic fire a shot at 
Golden 
Grizzlies 
goalkeeper 
Sullivan Lauderdale. They saw 
senior forward Jack Hallahan 
bury the rebound in the back of 
the net, and they saw him run off 
celebrating. 
But the most important part of 
the play came before that. Faced 
with a charging defender along 
the sideline, junior forward Umar 
Farouk Osman made a quick 
stutter-step that put his opponent 
on skates, creating space for a 
cross to Popovic to set up the goal. 
The Wolverines’ (3-2-1) ability 
to maintain possession under 
pressure was vital to their 2-0 
win against Oakland (3-2-1) at the 
U-M Soccer Stadium on Tuesday. 
In the first half, Michigan’s 
ball-hawking attack forced the 
Grizzlies 
into 
mistakes 
and 
opened up passing lanes for the 
Wolverines. 
“I thought we were real 
positive, I thought the forwards 

were really lively early on,” said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“And that caused their back four 
some problems.”
Those problems on the Oakland 
back line showed themselves 
again minutes after Hallahan’s 
goal. Catching the Grizzlies’ 
defenders out of position, senior 
defender Abdou Samake lobbed a 
perfectly placed ball up the middle 
to Popovic, forcing Lauderdale out 
of goal to challenge the Wolverine 
forward. Popovic struck the ball 
off one bounce, 
cheekily 
floating 
it over the keeper 
into the goal. 
“If you can get 
the second balls 
and turn and face 
the game, Daley 
said, “ … we can 
always be a little 
bit dangerous.” 
Once again, it 
was 
Michigan’s 
patience that created a scoring 
opportunity. Instead of forcing 
a pass through traffic that could 
lead to a turnover, the Wolverines’ 
midfielders cycled the ball around 
and waited for their opponents to 
slip up. 

“The 
two 
central 
guys 
were really good,” Daley said. 
“(Sophomore midfielder Kevin 
Buca) picked up a lot of passes and 
(junior midfielder Marc Ybarra) 
dictated the tempo of the game, 
and I thought those things helped 
us stay on the front foot.”
In the second half, Samake 
anchored a Michigan defense 
that completely stifled Oakland’s 
attack. When the focus shifted 
from 
creating 
offensive 
opportunities 
to 
controlling 
the 
game 
defensively, 
he and junior 
defender 
Jackson 
Ragen 
stepped 
up 
and 
used 
their 
physical 
presence 
to 
keep 
the 
ball 
away 
from 
the 
Grizzlies’ 
attackers. 
“I think our fullbacks do a 
really good job getting balls to 
feet,” Daley said. “They balance 
each other really well. Both are 
really physically tough, physically 
strong, high-level competitors … 
and they’ve been excellent.”

Belief. 
It’s a word Michigan men’s 
soccer coach Chaka Daley used 
a lot after the Wolverines’ (3-2-1) 
2-0 victory over Oakland (3-2-1) 
on Tuesday night. 
More 
specifically, 
Daley 
wanted to take that belief away 
from the Golden Grizzlies. His 
squad had plenty of their own.
The latter was evident from 
the opening touches of the first 
half. Led by senior forward Jack 
Hallahan, 
Michigan 
created 
turnovers 
and 
forced 
early 
attacks into its front third. Just 
a few minutes into the match, 
Hallahan found the back of the 
net — only to have it wiped off the 
board due to a foul off the ball. 
Close calls like this have been 
all too familiar for Hallahan this 
season; he leads the conference 
in shots, but had yet to score.
“The post is like my best 
friend,” Hallahan said of his 
scoring dry spell. 
In 
the 
11th 
minute, 
the 
Wolverines were able to force 
more shots on target and finally 
capitalize. 
Hallahan 
found 
the ball at his feet after a shot 
by graduate transfer forward 
Nebosja Popovic was deflected 
by Oakland goalkeeper Sullivan 
Lauderdale, and he finally broke 
the drought. But when asked 
about what he did best, Hallahan 
was quick to acknowledge his 
achievements on the other side 
of the ball.
“Everyone expects me to do 
stuff in the attack and it’ll come, 
but tonight, I didn’t let anyone 
down 
defensively,” 
Hallahan 
said.
Just a few minutes later, 
Popovic, the former Golden 
Grizzly, 
streaked 
downfield. 
Upon receiving a well-played 
through 
ball 
from 
senior 
defender Abdou Samake, he 
snuck the ball over Lauderdale 
from just outside the box on only 
one touch. Popovic said his goal 

and the game’s final outcome 
“confirmed (he) made the right 
decision” in choosing to come to 
Michigan after being recruited 
by 
the 
school 
on 
several 
occasions. 
The Golden Grizzlies’ fast-
paced and aggressive play proved 
to all in attendance that they 
were down, but not out. They 
played a lot of balls into the air 
in hopes of forcing some chances 
on goal, but the Wolverines’ back 
four worked as a unit and didn’t 
let balls get over their heads. 
Thanks to their 
efforts, 
senior 
goalkeeper 
Andrew 
Verdi 
only 
had 
to 
attend 
to 
two 
shots on target. 
The 
second 
half proved that 
a game against 
Michigan’s 
in-state 
counterparts 
would be far from a tune-up 
before Big Ten play. The Golden 
Grizzlies made several crucial 
adjustments to stay competitive 
and 
give 
themselves 
every 
chance to score. They played 
with three in the back, allowing 
their supplemented front to 
force 
extended 
stays 
deep 
in Wolverine territory. They 
favored a ground attack over 
playing balls in the air because 
Michigan had been so effective in 
forcing turnovers and otherwise 

interrupting Oakland’s first half 
aerial exchanges. 
Aware of the dangers of this 
revamped attack, Daley could 
be heard exhorting his forwards 
to hustle on defense. A bevy of 
Golden 
Grizzly 
substitutions 
with a baker’s dozen or so 
minutes remaining confirmed 
their commitment to attacking 
with fresh legs until the final 
whistle.
In some ways, according to 
Daley, that means the Wolverines 
failed.
“We 
were 
trying 
to 
get 
a third (goal) 
first,” 
Daley 
mused. “Can we 
end the game, 
or can we end 
their 
belief?” 
The answer on 
Tuesday 
was 
no. 
Instead, 
Michigan 
had 
to “see the game 
out and manage the game to the 
end.” 
That meant neutralizing the 
playmaking impact of Golden 
Grizzly junior midfielder Noah 
Jensen, according to Daley. And 
in the last 10 minutes, his men 
succeeded in doing just that. 
After watching the Wolverines 
build their lead in the first 15 
minutes and protect it in the last 
75, Michigan fans can be assured 
that there is much to believe in 
for the upcoming campaign.

Michigan thrives at Inverness Club

To anyone deep in the golf 
world, Inverness Club is more 
than just a course.
Located in Toledo, Ohio, the 
historic club has hosted some 
of the sport’s most prestigious 
events, including four U.S. Opens, 
a pair of PGA Championships and 
the U.S. Amateur.
And Monday and Tuesday, 
women collegiate golfers walked 
the fairways during the Glass 
City Invitational. Among the pack 
was the Michigan women’s golf 
team, which shot 10-over par for 
a second-place finish in its first 
competition of the season. Florida 
got in the clubhouse four strokes 
better than the Wolverines to best 
the 13-team field.
“It’s a great start to our season,” 
said Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“It was pretty special to be 
playing at such a historic venue as 
Inverness.” 
Sophomore Sophia Trombetta, 
freshman Hailey Borja and senior 
Hannah Ghelfi were Michigan’s 
three keys to success, finishing 
third, tied for fourth and tied for 
ninth, respectively. Sophomore 
Ashley Lau and junior Ashley 
Kim also started for the team 
and finished 37th and 40th, 
respectively.
“Our returners worked hard 
and we have a strong freshman 

class,” Dowling said. “The group 
of nine of them are really pushing 
each other to be better. Our hard 
work is already starting to pay 
off.”
Distance is a critical aspect of 
Trombetta’s game. This week, 
her length off the tee helped 
turn short holes into scoring 
opportunities by providing wedge 
shots into many of the greens.
“She’s a really good wedge 
player,” Dowling said. “She had 
wedges in her hand a lot and just 
took advantage of it.”
Trombetta sat in sixth after 
Monday’s 
opening 
two 
rounds at one-
over 
par. 
She 
carded 
a 
71 
on 
Tuesday, 
though, to jump 
three spots on 
the leaderboard. 
Her jump fueled 
the 
team’s 
movement from 
fourth place on 
Monday to runner-up.
Meanwhile, Borja excelled in 
the first event of her collegiate 
career. She led the team on the 
first day, with a 143 (71-72) after 36 
holes, at third overall. 
“It’s a nice start to her collegiate 
career,” Dowling said. “She’s a 
really solid ball-striker — doesn’t 
miss many fairways, doesn’t miss 
many greens.”

Dowling 
had 
seen 
Borja 
compete in person prior to 
Monday while recruiting her, but 
this was her first time watching 
up close, and Dowling enjoyed the 
new perspective. The freshman’s 
steadiness stood out to the coach, 
and she was also pleased that 
Borja was in contention to win her 
first event.
“She’s got a very mature 
process of how to hit golf shots,” 
Dowling said. “She seems like 
she’s a veteran out there already. 
Nothing seems to faze her at all.”
When playing a landmark 
course 
like 
Inverness, 
rewriting history 
is a tall task — 
there are too many 
major Sundays to 
compete with.
Yet 
Michigan 
still made the most 
out of the outing. 
This tournament 
marked 
the 
Wolverines’ 
best 
finish since the 2016-17 season.
Dowling hopes to use this 
performance as a building block 
for the rest of the season.
“It shows a lot of the talent 
this team has and what they’re 
capable of,” Dowling said. “We 
got in contention to win a golf 
tournament, and it was just a 
really great experience for our 
team.”

‘M’ starts slow under Zach Barlow

There were many firsts this 
weekend for the Michigan 
men’s 
golf 
team. 
First 
tournament of the season. First 
tournament for a first-year 
head coach. With pre-match 
jitters and undeniable growing 
pains under the direction of 
Zach Barlow, the Wolverines 
looked to break out of a three-
year rut and again become a 
competitive team.
But there’s no denying the 
struggles 
Michigan 
faced 
in 
the 
Windon 
Memorial 
Tournament 
in 
Illinois 
on 
Monday 
and 
Tuesday. 
Ultimately finishing 13 out 
of 14 teams, the Wolverines 
recognize 
their 
potential 
and are working on ways of 
harnessing a “refuse to lose” 
mindset to be a competitive 
team this year. 
Michigan came out of the 
gates strong in each of the 
three rounds, but settled into 
a lull in the middle of each. 
Once the Wolverines started 
digressing, they couldn’t stop 
the bleeding. Barlow, hired just 
four months ago, points to the 
new season and coaching staff 
as a part of the problem.
“We showed stretches of 
what 
our 
potential 
could 
be, but we couldn’t sustain 
that throughout the entire 
tournament,” 
Barlow 
said. 
“The sky’s the limit for these 
guys.”
Barlow’s experience from 
the well-established Illinois 
golf team will surely aid him 
in 
this 
process. 
Over 
the 
past decade, he was both an 
assistant coach and player 
for the Illini. As an assistant 
coach Barlow helped the team 
win five consecutive Big Ten 
titles, three NCAA regional 
championships and advance 
to five straight NCAA finals. 
Last season, he was a finalist 
for the Assistant Coach of the 
Year award. 
While their lulls lingered in 
the rounds longer than desired, 
the Wolverines’ driving was a 
highlight for the tournament. 

Senior and top scorer for 
the tournament Brent Ito hit 
almost 70 percent of fairways. 
His solid driving skills helped 
him secure an overall score of 
one-under par, as he birdied 
a short par five on the 17th 
hole. While the driving was a 
strength, Michigan’s Achilles 
heel for the tournament was its 
short game. 
Both 
Ito 
and 
Barlow 
think 
this 
tournament 
was reflective 
of the team’s 
overall 
performance 
both early in 
this season and 
last year. Their 
biggest point of 
emphasis going forward will 
be consistency. 
“They are as talented as any 
team I’ve coached,” Barlow 
said. “I just think today and 
this week was a microcosm of 
what they have been struggling 
with in the past.”
This season is more personal 
for Ito, as he is five months 
into recovering from an ankle 
injury. On Monday, he played 
36 holes, a feat challenging 
for anyone. Ito admits it’s 
always tough to walk 36 holes. 
However, 
after 
undergoing 
rehad for his injury over the 
past five months, he was 
only able to compete in one 
tournament this summer. 
Ito looks forward to the 
challenges 
his 
senior 
year 

holds with a new coaching staff 
and weighing the possibility of 
turning pro after graduation. 
He wants it to be a learning 
experience. 
“Hopefully 
(the 
new 
coaching staff) will be a breath 
of fresh air,” Ito said. “Practices 
already 
feel 
different. 
It’s 
more team oriented. He makes 
practice 
about 
finishing a job 
as a team rather 
than necessarily 
getting your two 
and a half hours 
of work in.”
As a senior, 
Ito has turned 
his focus to what 
comes next. His 
ultimate goal is 
continuing 
to 
play after graduation.
“I want to take this last year 
as an assessment of where I’m 
at,” Ito said.
If he continues to play as 
well as he did at the Windon 
Memorial, there’s no stopping 
Ito from turning professional 
shortly after graduation. 
Once the Wolverines and 
coaching staff gets over the 
hump of the getting-to-know-
you stage, Barlow is certain 
Michigan 
will 
find 
great 
success. 
“My goal is to get to know 
each one of these guys down 
to their core,” Barlow said. 
“Figure out what makes them 
tick. We will be a much better 
team and I will be a much better 
coach once that happens.”

Patterson looks to make a statement

When Jim Harbaugh strode to 
the podium on Monday, he carried 
the demeanor of a man focused 
only on what was ahead of him, 
unwilling to admit distraction.
Harbaugh was asked about the 
offensive struggles, about where 
his team had improved over the 
bye week and where it needed 
to improve further. He was 
asked about ball security and the 
challenges of playing Wisconsin, 
and none of this would be notable 
if it didn’t carry a certain air to 
it — a connotation that Michigan 
would be in an uphill battle on 
Saturday. Then things got more 
direct, with a reporter asking 
about the feeling of being a Vegas 
underdog. Harbaugh barely gave 
a cursory stare.
“That’s irrelevant,” he said.
So, a day later when the 
normally 
soft-spoken 
senior 
quarterback Shea Patterson took 
his turn, it was unsurprising when 
he, too, fell back on platitudes in 
the face of those same questions.
But after 10 minutes of being 
lobbed questions connoting a 
challenge, giving little benefit of 
the doubt to what Patterson was 
saying about the offense letting 
loose, maybe his patience wore a 
bit thin. He was asked how close 
the Wolverines are to showing 
the world what they’ve seen in 
practice — an offense that can fire 
on all cylinders.
“Uh, what is it?” Patterson 
asked in response. “Three-and-a-
half, four days?”
Indeed, from Tuesday night 
when Patterson spoke, it was four 
until gameday.
“Yeah, we’re gonna go out 
there and make a statement,” 
Patterson said. “Simple as that.”
And 
despite 
the 
obvious 
hedge — winning on the road 
at Wisconsin, a top-15 team in 
a venue the Wolverines haven’t 
walked out of with a victory since 
2001 would be a statement unto 
itself — everyone knows it isn’t 
that simple.

A statement would be following 
up on what we heard all spring 
and summer about this offense. 
It would mean going in and 
showing everyone what this unit 
— a senior quarterback with three 
NFL-caliber receivers, should 
Donovan Peoples-Jones return, 
a top-50 recruit at running back 
and an offensive line chock full 
of returning starters — can do 
when it’s rolling and when its 
coordinator doesn’t get gun-shy.
Patterson 
is, 
literally 
and 
figuratively, 
often 
a 
quiet 
figure 
with 
recorders thrust 
into his face. 
That does not 
mean he lacks 
confidence. He 
hasn’t 
since 
fifth 
grade, 
when his dad 
coached 
him. 
“It was a little 
rough at first,” Patterson said. Yet 
here he is.
“I’m very confident and that 
comes with the guys around me,” 
Patterson said. “How can you 
not have confidence in yourself 
when you have our O-Line and 
unbelievable targets outside and a 
hell of a defense behind you?”
It’s a good question, and really 
the only answer is to point to 
the last two weeks. The offense 
turned the ball over, unable to 
hold onto it. The defense gave 
up points when it got put in bad 
situations. Even when they kept 

the ball, the Wolverines played 
with timidity and struggled to 
move the chains. Michigan nearly 
lost to an unranked Army team at 
home.
Do that against Wisconsin and 
the Wolverines won’t walk out so 
lucky.
Patterson 
knows 
that, 
and so does everyone else in 
Schembechler Hall.
“We haven’t been playing the 
best football we can play and we 
know that,” said senior safety 
Josh 
Metellus. 
“We got guys in 
this building who, 
potential, like way 
up here. We’re not 
reaching that.”
The 
only 
news 
there 
is 
that 
Michigan 
is 
publicly 
acknowledging 
what 
everyone 
can 
see. 
Make 
the kind of statement Patterson 
talked about and the conversation 
will quickly turn back to where it 
was two weeks ago, all about Big 
Ten titles and College Football 
Playoff berths. As many questions 
surround 
the 
Wolverines 
now, narratives change fast. 
Statements aren’t made in the 
quiet comfort of your own 
practice facility.
“I’m done talking about it,” 
Patterson said at the end of his 
session Tuesday, walking away 
from the group of reporters.
It’s time to show it.

Healthy Jeter aims to boost defense

Don Brown let out a sigh and 
a trailing “you know” before 
pausing.
Standing in the Schembechler 
Hall lobby last week, he had just 
been asked for his assessment of his 
defense through two weeks. The 
indecision in his initial reaction 
continued throughout his answer 
as he shuffled between positives 
and negatives, resistant to any 
grand declarations.
The evidence for each came 
naturally. In its first two games, 
every regulation touchdown that 
Michigan’s 
first-team 
defense 
allowed came off a turnover. And 
yet, the Wolverines were 50th in 
Division I with 21 points per game 
allowed despite not facing a Power 
Five team.
All of that, though, was before 
the bye week.
“We haven’t been playing the 
best football we can play,” said 
senior safety Josh Metellus. “And 
we know that we’ve got guys in this 
building whose potential is way up 
here. We’re not reaching that.”
A bye week, of course, isn’t some 
magic cure. Wisconsin had one of 
its own and was off a start in which 
it outscored opposition, 110-0.
Still, it’s an opportunity for 

Michigan to look itself in the 
mirror and diagnose what went 
wrong in its underwhelming start. 
The Wolverines will hold most of 
that diagnosis close to their chest 
until Saturday, but junior defensive 
tackle Donovan Jeter’s return to 
full health is one piece of the puzzle 
that can’t be hidden.
“Donovan’s a really aggressive 
player,” said junior defensive tackle 
Ben Mason. “He adds a lot. Big guy, 
comes off the ball hard. So it should 
a good add for us this week.”
After missing the opener against 
Middle Tennessee State, Jeter 
returned against Army in week 
two, but was limited to a few snaps. 
It stood in direct contrast to the 
expectations that bubbled for him 
throughout the spring, when he 
was one of Michigan’s most hyped 
players.
For months, this was supposed 
to be Jeter’s breakout after two 
years of sitting behind a deep 
defensive line that graduated both 
starters last offseason. “You get 
tired of sitting on the bench,” Jeter 
said Tuesday, reflecting on those 
two years.
But instead of a breakthrough, 
Jeter got hurt. Meanwhile, Mason 
struggled and senior Michael 
Dwumfour played one snap before 
getting sidelined with an injury of 
his own.

“It was frustrating cause I 
obviously want to be out there 
helping the team,” Jeter said. 
“But luckily it was just one week, 
nothing too severe. It could’ve been 
worse, I missed my freshman year 
with something a lot worse. It was 
frustrating, but at the end of the 
day, it was only one week.”
The resulting adjustment had 
a domino effect down Michigan’s 
defense. Sophomore defensive end 
Aidan Hutchinson moved to tackle 
beside Carlo Kemp, while senior 
linebacker Josh Uche had to move 
into an every-down role on the 
front four.
Against MTSU and Army, that 
speed-heavy look mostly worked. 
But Wisconsin wins games in the 
trenches, by pounding the ball 
up the middle with All-American 
running back Jonathan Taylor.
Metellus wants to come back 
to Ann Arbor on Sunday and say, 
“This team is playing the best 
football right now. This team is 
reaching strides. This team is 
moving up better than we were 
the past couple weeks. This team is 
really doing something that we’re 
capable of.”
To make that a reality, the 
Wolverines will need to stop Taylor. 
They’ll need to make good on two 
weeks of post-Army adjustments. 
And, most likely, they’ll need Jeter.

Mel Pearson calls for rules changes ahead of Big Ten coaches’ meeting

It looked like an ordinary, run-
of-the-mill practice. The entire 
Michigan hockey team was on 
the ice working through drills 
and skating the occasional sprint, 
while the three goaltenders 
rotated in and out of the nets at 
each end.
But there was one major 
difference that made for an 
atypical day at Yost Ice Arena 
last Wednesday.
Instead of being down on the 
ice coaching, Mel Pearson and 
his staff were forced to sit in the 
stands and watch.
According to Big Ten rules, 
teams must have two days off 
per week before the official start 
of their season. But on those 
days off, coaches can make the 
ice available for any player who 
would like to get extra reps in.
“(The rule is) to try and help 
student athletes and take some 
of the burden off of them as far 
as the practice out of season and 
whatnot,” Pearson said Sept. 11. 
“But if you ask our guys (on days) 
like today, would they rather be 
out there with coaches or just out 
there (doing) their own thing?
“They’re hockey players. A 
couple of them are gonna be 
multi-million-dollar 
athletes. 
They’re training. It’s why they’re 
here. That’s what they want to 
do.”
Pearson isn’t normally one to 
voice his frustrations with rules 
or officiating, but at a meeting 
of the Big Ten hockey coaches 
on Wednesday, Pearson hopes 
they’ll get the ball rolling on a 
conversation 
about 
potential 
changes. It’s clear there are a few 
hot-button issues Pearson feels 
strongly about, including being 
allowed to add a third full-time 
assistant coach.
When asked about the issue of 
a third coach, Pearson answered 
quickly and decisively, stating 
his answer before the question 
was fully posed.
“Yes,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“Absolutely.”
The 
Wolverines 
have 
28 
players and just three full-time 
coaches — Pearson, associate 

head coach Bill Muckalt and 
assistant coach Kris Mayotte. 
For 
perspective, 
Michigan 
basketball has 15 players and 
four 
full-time 
coaches, 
and 
Michigan football has 11 coaches 
for 85 scholarship players and a 
number of walk-ons.
While other college sports 
have the option of recruiting 
during their offseason, hockey 
season runs the same portion 
of the year at every level of 
the sport, forcing Pearson and 
his staff to balance being at 
Michigan with being out on the 
road recruiting.
Pearson spent 23 years with 
the 
Wolverines 
under 
Red 
Berenson, and he said for most 
road trips, only Berenson and one 
assistant would travel with the 
team while the other assistant 

went out on recruiting trips.
There 
have 
been 
conversations about advocating 
for an additional coach, but the 
Division II and III schools with 
Division I hockey programs tend 
to put a stop to 
such talks. While 
schools 
like 
Michigan 
and 
other Power Five 
teams can afford 
another 
salary, 
the 
smaller 
schools 
with 
more 
limited 
resources 
are 
more resistant to 
additional staff.
“We’re not as unified and as 
organized as some of the other 
coaches’ associations, and that’s 
where (the decision) has to come 

from,” Pearson said. “I know 
softball and baseball are trying 
to get another third coach right 
now. We definitely need one.”
Other rules also frustrate 
Pearson, such as the NCAA-
mandated extra 
14 
days 
that 
must be taken off 
during the school 
year. 
Because 
Michigan starts 
school 
after 
Labor Day and 
begins 
second 
semester 
early 
in January, the 
Wolverines have 
to 
take 
their 
extra days off in-season or much 
closer to the season than Pearson 
would like.
“Some programs, it doesn’t 

affect,” Pearson said Monday. 
“But for us, because of our 
academic 
calendar, 
it 
really 
affects our program, taking the 
extra 14 days off. I’d like to see 
that change.”
Part of Pearson’s displeasure 
comes from the fact that the 
rules vary by conference, with 
few rules about days off and the 
like shared across college hockey. 
The off-day that required him to 
sit and watch practice from the 
stands is mandated by the Big 
Ten, but schools like Ferris State, 
which the Wolverines will face 
at the Great Lakes Invitational, 
only have to take one day off per 
week.
“You’re 
already 
behind,” 
Pearson said Sept. 11. “Every 
week you lose a day.”
On Wednesday, the Big Ten 

hockey head coaches and sport 
administrators from each school 
will meet to discuss some of 
the issues facing the sport. 
While Pearson is hopeful they’ll 
start a conversation for some 
rule changes, both within the 
conference and across the sport, 
he has a cynical attitude about it 
after nearly 40 years in coaching.
“When you get 60 schools 
voting on something — I know 
that the way it’s structured is 
that Division I schools are the 
only ones supposed to vote on 
Division I issues — but with 
hockey, 
it’s 
weird,” 
Pearson 
said. “A lot of times we don’t get 
things passed, even though we’re 
in a Power Five conference. We 
should have power. We don’t 
have any power. It’s one of the 
most frustrating parts.”

The Michigan 
difference...
in career paths


D

ad, 
I’m sorry I never told you I was 
quitting soccer. The goals that we 
built together never fully manifested, and 
it was too hard for me to tell you in person. 
Our lifelong father-son puzzle has fallen 
short here, at the University of Michigan. I 
did not know it then, but looking back now I 
understand how proud you must have been 
to see that goal posted above my bed: “play 
professional soccer.” Without your sacri-
fices, I would not be close to where I’m at 
today. There’s so much I’ve wanted to tell 
you over the years, but words are always 
harder to find in the moment. I hope this 
letter shows you all you’ve done for me, and 
all that is left for me to find on my own. But 
mostly, that soccer will always be ours. 
I like to think soccer was my profound 
connection to the world, an arbitrary love 
that derived out of some deterministic fate, 
a secret language between the ball and my 
feet. From the beginning there was this 
subtle art in which the ball freely flowed on 
the field. I loved the sound of the grass part-
ing, leaving a line as I passed the ball to your 
feet and you smiled. I was a child blissfully 
at play. 
This “love” was the centripetal force that 
kept our family so close. Tethered to your 
grandiose passion for the sport, I was des-
tined to keep playing, no matter what. My 
first memory of soccer evades me, but per-
haps you can recall. Did the game choose 
me or did I choose it? The feeling of being 
with the ball became so innate as the years 
moved on that the question soon eluded me. 
The game became a chance to escape my 
mind, and my identity slowly merged itself 
to it — the first thing that looked like love.
In eighth grade, when I was asked to pen 
a letter to my future self, I responded pas-
sionately in a way that made you proud. I 
was genuinely sure of who I wanted to be. I 
wrote, in my block/bubble hybrid handwrit-
ing, about the only thing I knew — I wanted 
to be a professional soccer player. 
And yet, as a 12-year-old, my goals were 
not entirely my own. Standing in a mir-
ror, I always saw you pointing back at me. 
Coming from a privileged community, 
the world wasn’t leaping out of its shoes to 
show me my naïveté, so soccer became the 
lens through which I learned, and you were 
almost always the teacher. 

Each lesson I learned, on and off the pitch, 
always aligned with our soccer goals. In the 
summers, that meant hours at the field with 
a repetition of shots, 12 balls for each corner, 
left and right, each passing round marked by 
the word “again.” 
In the winters, the echoes of the rac-
quetball walls were conditioned faintly into 
my ears with each pass. The sound of the 
last rolled into the next, until a constant 
white noise appeared. What started as play 
became a routine of practice and repetition. 
With each touch, pass and shot, we built 
together the foundation of our relationship. 
If I wasn’t playing for the love of the game, 
I certainly was doing it to be loved by you. 
As I grew, the expectations of the game 
grew more immense. My anxiety and the 
constant criticism I faced blended together 
to create a meticulous form of perfectionism. 
Even after bright performances, you were 
always fixing my mistakes, constantly hon-
ing and molding me like a fine craftsman. 
I know you were hard on me for a reason, 
so I was equally hard on myself. I wanted 
nothing more than to prove you wrong. I 
knocked the ball against the wall for hours in 
the backyard, constantly hearing your voice, 
until I finally internalized it as my own. 
Accordingly, one mistake in game would 
sometimes haunt me for the rest of the 
match. Without knowing it, we both had 
created a paradoxical loop. My greatest 
assets — practice and perfection — also 
became my downfall. Still, I always wanted 
more, to prove to you that I was everything 
but a quitter. 
When the inner workings of chance 
and geometric luck combined with hours 
of sweaty shirts and fancy footwork, we 
had finally done it, Dad. I walked around 
Ann Arbor with you and Mom in a dream-
like state. My whole life had been for this 
moment. You put your arms around my 
shoulders as we walked out of the Michigan 
Athletics office, freshly signed to the Uni-
versity of Michigan. I can’t remember if you 
said you were proud of me, but I could feel 
your warm presence. 
As I walked out of the locker room and 
into my dreams, I lightly tapped the words 
“WIN FOR MICHIGAN.” Standing in front 
of the crowds with jittery hands, I took a 
deep breath and looked for your familiar face. 
With a slight nod of your head, the years of 

preparation raced through my mind. Nobody 
knew how I was standing there, but you. 
Two years treaded on and problems are 
destined to arise when the sole basis of your 
identity is built on performance. When I did 
not play well, I excluded myself from any 
validation. My idea of self-worth became 
thin, reduced to something that my coaches 
could fiddle with. Off the pitch, I always felt 
the need for approval, which I was no longer 
getting from soccer — a never-ending act, 
constantly appeasing others as I had done 
my whole life. 
Simultaneously, the game no longer 
seemed like my own, a version manipulated 
for far too long to fit the views of how oth-
ers perceived I should play. College athlet-
ics, built around structure, rationale and 
winning, had bullied out the formlessness 
and freedom I had found at any early age. 
My creative dance with the ball came with 
instructions on how and when to do it. 
At times, I still felt like that child at play, 
smiling effortlessly, unburdened by what 
the game had become. I hoped that when I 
found anxiety and insecurities while play-
ing, that child would empower me to play 
with passion. I hoped he would help me 
dictate every move and mistake as I purely 
played for the love of the game. But, by 

my senior year, the expectations of those 
around me had rotted away that part of 
the game. Soon, I felt as if I was playing for 
everyone but myself. 
One should never pursue their craft with 
popularity as the sole purpose, and yet, most 
of our creative outlets are monetized and 
marketed based on their transactional value. 
With soccer, my form of creativity became 
battered and bruised beneath the demands 
of winning. My soul was sick and tired of 
soccer’s solid shell. The soft elements of play 
that I first found with you were now broken 
and brittle. Hardness and strength had left a 
steel bridge, with no room for water to flow. 
I know we never reached our final goal, 
but in my 17 years of playing, I don’t think 
we should end on a negative note. Society 
often looks at athletes as one-dimensional, 
but each sport comes with its own socio-
logical, psychological and cultural char-
acteristics. For me, in my highly subjective 
biases, soccer is not just a game, but an art 
and philosophy. At its pinnacle, it reaches 
for an aesthetic dimension, utilizing dance 
and movement of the body through space. 
I learned throughout my years playing that 
a sense of honor and duty comes from com-
petition, forcing me to search the limits and 
potentials of my mind and body.

The I in Athlete

BY LUCAS ROSENDALL, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

COURTESY OF LUCAS ROSENDALL


J

ournalist 
Micheal 
Herr 
once 
wrote, “It took the war to teach it, 
that you were as responsible for 
everything you saw as you were for every-
thing you did.” 
This quote first appeared in Herr’s book 
“Dispatches” published in 1977, where he 
described his experiences in Vietnam as 
a correspondent for Esquire Magazine. 
I am not writing about the Vietnam war, 
not even about a book about the war. I am 
writing about this quote and how it came 
back to me years later while I was living in 
Germany. 
I 

was born in Chile but spent the 
majority of my life living in sev-
eral cities across the United States. 
I believe that my yearning to find a place 
to call home has propelled me to explore 
other parts of the world. I have no con-
nections to Europe, but I spent the last five 
years of my life learning French and Ger-
man. So, like many 20-year-olds who are 
privileged enough to lack serious adult 
responsibilities do, I jumped at the idea of 
traveling abroad. 
During my third year of my college, on 
a half-baked plan, a depleted bank account 
and two semesters of German, I found 
myself committing to studying abroad for 
seven months in Berlin and Munich.
From the beginning of my German 
career, I was told by my eclectic professor 
that, as a student of the German language, 
I was responsible not only for learning all 
four cases of the German language, but the 
history of Germany as well. This history 
would be centered on the rise of fascism in 
Europe and, in particular, the role of Nazi 
Germany in the 20th century. 
As soon as I touched down in Germany, 
the war was inescapable. I couldn’t walk 
down the street without seeing some 
memorial dedicated to the war. Even Frau 
Dette, my landlord in Berlin, who lived the 
precarities of post-World War II Germany, 
carried the war in her soul. But this living 
memory of the war, in the people and on 
the streets, wasn’t always part of German 
culture. It took a generation of Germans, 
those whose parents were alive during the 
war — demanding to know the truth of 
their families and their country — to make 
this collective consciousness possible. 
Those who fall more towards the left on 
the political spectrum argue that, regard-
less of the history classes, it isn’t enough. 
They argue that the recent backlash 
against refugees in Germany is in part due 
to the heritage of the war. As someone who 
has always had a certain fascination for 
history — in particular family histories — I 
wanted to hear the stories that missed my 
textbooks. So, I asked. 

I first met Noah in a literature seminar 
titled “Literature and Exile.” We were 
partnered up for a presentation, and I 
made sure to introduce myself. After class, 
we walked off campus towards a patch of 
green to get to know each other. With the 
wind blowing through the trees and the 
sun shining, no one could have suspected 
the heaviness of conversation we had on 
that bench. 
Noah was born and raised in Germany. 
I remember we started talking about his 
family and the war and, somehow, over the 
course of our conversation the personal 
turned political. Given all the tension in 
Germany regarding refugees and other 
world events, I asked if people had felt they 
overcame the war. He looked at me and 
without blinking he replied, “A country can 
never overcome its history.”
O

f the five classes I took at Lud-
wig Maximilian University of 
Munich, only one was about the 
Nazi regime and included a day trip to a 
concentration camp in the syllabus. 
I visited Dachau at the end of June, dur-
ing the height of the coverage of the Mex-
ican-American border crisis. I remember 
walking around the eerie grounds, seeing 
the dust in the air and listening to the guide 
talk about the rise of fascism in Germany. 
Despite being so far away from my friends 
and family, both physically and culturally, 
I couldn’t help but think about the state of 
the United States. My mind started to draw 
connections between images of children 
in cages and the German concentration 
camps. 
T

his year alone, I have had three 
different phone numbers belong-
ing to three different countries. 
Sometimes the feeling of disorientation 
seems to be the only consistent thing in 
my life.
This lack of consistency seems to be 
mirrored in the politics of today. I know 
that the United States, an America under 
President Donald Trump may seem to 
many like a joke made in bad taste. But I 
don’t think this administration is a mock-
ery of politics. I believe it is the overt and 
violent exhaustion of liberal democracy 
in crisis. The past three years have been, 
for many, an emotionally exhausting 
and politically confusing time. Ameri-
cans have been whipped back and forth 
between policies that continue to polarize 
the political landscape. 
While illegal immigration has been a 
hot topic for several presidencies, the cur-
rent situation at the Southern border is 
attracting more attention than ever. The 
images of children in cages, masses of 
immigrants lined up behind barbed wire 

and the drowned bodies of Óscar Alberto 
Martínez and his 23-month-old daughter 
Angie Valeria have been circulating since 
April of last year. I am now struggling 
to grasp the contemporary landscape of 
America as it unfolds before my very eyes. 
The detention centers are being com-
pared to concentration camps, and these 
statements have been met with enormous 
backlash from both sides of the political 
spectrum. People are afraid that drawing 
a connection between detention centers 
and concentration camps diminishes the 
atrocities that occurred under Nazi Ger-
many. Others argue that the gravity of the 
situation at the Southern border demands 
an examination of this severity. 
In the wake of this debate, I see the aper-
ture for a new discussion regarding democ-
racy and extremism. 
Society would like to use a simple check-
list to determine if what is happening 
counts as facism. Some political scientists 
would likely argue that because Trump is 
not actively promoting the dismantling of 
the American democracy, his administra-
tion therefore cannot be considered fascist. 
But I think that if we hide behind this rigid 
definition of fascism, then we will never 
confront the brutality of what is happen-
ing. 
I think these detention centers, in a very 
visceral way, are injecting the framework 
of war into daily life. They are promoting 
fascist rhetoric by creating hierarchies of 
affirmation and conformity. We look at 
each other wondering first what it is that 
differentiates us, and if we pass this test 
then we seek to find what unites us. Deten-
tion centers manifest an “us versus them” 

narrative reinforcing our fear of the other. 
Those placed inside the detention center 
are outside the community and, therefore, 
are not afforded the same rights of citizens. 
To me, detention centers, like concen-
tration camps before them, become a 
void where any type of violation of rights 
becomes the rule. Placed outside a larger 
community those held in detention centers 
are labeled as outsiders, stripped of rights 
and vulnerable to all kinds of abuse. 
We can get lost in a debate of defini-
tion. However, if we spend all our time and 
energy discussing if fascism is back or if we 
need a new term, then the atrocities on the 
border will continue happening. If people 
resign themselves to fear of the other, as 
fostered by a fascist-like rhetoric, all acts of 
violence and hate will be excused. 
What will come, when those children 
who spent months in cages grow up and 
tell their stories? 
We may not be at the border, but we have 
all seen the images. We are responsible. 
We may not be keeping children in cages, 
but we are watching silently. Just like Herr 
said, we are responsible for everything we 
see just as much as everything we did (or 
did not do). 
Whether or not there is a consensus 
regarding fascism in the United States, 
everyone is responsible for what is happen-
ing at the U.S.-Mexico border. This crisis 
will become another chapter in an already 
complicated history of the United States, 
and, like Noah said on that park bench, a 
country doesn’t forget its history — history 
doesn’t disappear like bodies that drown in 
the Rio Grande.

he subway screeched to a stop at Sixth 
Avenue and I stepped onto the muggy 
platform. Walking up the stairs, the 
skyscraper sentinels of New York City loomed over 
me. The sidewalk of the “Avenue of the Americas” 
was crowded with urbanites — talented, successful 
individuals who were “making it” in the Big Apple. 
Surrounded by these veteran New Yorkers in their 
suits and pencil skirts, I could almost pretend I was 
one of them.
Even after memorizing the subway map and 
avoiding tourist traps, I felt out of place. I was the 
Midwestern girl in the big city, but instead of falling 
in love with it, my insecurities simmered. It wasn’t 
that I was lost or on my own, but that everyone 
seemed so professional and self-assured, incapable 
of making a wrong decision. 
L

ike 17,149 other University of Michigan 
students, I’m in the College of Literature, 
Science and the Arts. While the college 
offers 90 majors and sub majors, a mix of sciences 
and liberal arts, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts 
as an English major with two minors in history 
and political science. I had never questioned my 
academic choices until I scrolled through the 
countless job postings on Handshake and saw the 
missing check mark indicating that my major did 
not match the “employer’s preferences.” 
When will I stop having to defend my major? When 
will I stop second guessing what I’m passionate 
about? What, exactly, can I do with a liberal arts 
degree from LSA after I graduate? 
The University of Michigan started with LSA in 
1817, and the original college has since remained 
the largest of the 19 colleges on campus. The 
LSA website boasts an “employed or continuing 
education” rate of 96 percent, accompanied by an 
interactive graphic titled “What Will You Do with 

an LSA Degree.” Like colorful spokes of a bicycle 
wheel, the English Literature career path spans a 
wide breadth of disciplines — including Medicine/
Health, Technology and Engineering. 
However, the University Career Center depicts a 
slightly different post-graduation narrative. Every 
year the Career Center publishes a First Destination 
Profile, outlining the employment statistics of the 
most recent graduating class. According to them, 
only 89.8 percent of LSA graduates are employed or 
continuing their education. 
Another survey question asks students whether 
they think their new job has “clear career potential.” 
This felt very open-ended to me and difficult to 
answer, especially if a student hasn’t even started 
working yet. When I asked UCC Senior Associate 
Director Terri LaMarco to explain what qualifies as 
“clear potential” she responded, “We do not define 
that … so, that could be defined differently by the 
person completing the survey. Which is fine with us 
because what we’re after is, ‘Are you satisfied with 
the position that you have?’” The survey indicated 
only 60.5 percent of LSA respondent’s jobs have 
clear potential. 
In an email after our interview, LaMarco showed 
that the survey for the First Destination Survey has 
an average response rate of 32 percent and is issued 
three times a year in December, May and August to 
account for the varying student graduation and job 
recruitment timelines.
“The response rate is low, and that’s also pretty 
common for surveys like this. But we’re at a percent 
that does make it generalizable... A lot of data 
suggests that liberal arts students are more likely to 
be employed three to six months after graduation” 
LaMarco said. 
Perhaps sensing my panic as I began the all-
important job search, LSA published this on 

their website, “LSA has offered generations of 
students broad and deep programs of study and … 
has provided a foundation for successful lives and 
meaningful careers. Today, this transformative 
approach … attract(s) growing numbers of students 
who recognize the value of a liberal arts education.” 
Is it the intrinsic nature of liberal arts degree 
that enables English majors to become engineers 
or environmental science majors to be CEOs? Or 
is it a sheer force of will to prove our place in the 
increasingly professional world of work? 
U

niversity alum Erika Shevchek graduated 
in December 2018 with an English degree. 
After not being admitted to graduate 
school, she decided to stay in Ann Arbor for the 
summer and work three jobs while applying for 
writing jobs. 
“I’ve always wanted to be a writer, I know that 
sounds really cliché,” Shevchek said. 
Despite graduating a semester early, Shevchek 
was the last of her friends to “figure it out.”
“I was never upset that I chose English,” she said. 
“I don’t think me being an English major lowered my 
chances of getting a job, which everyone believes, 
but I don’t think that’s true.” 
Shevchek still plans on going to graduate school 
eventually, but for now she’s excited to start an 
editorial assistant internship in Philadelphia while 
also working in a restaurant to “pay the bills.” When 
we talked, her first day of work was the following 
Tuesday. 
“I’m excited not to work a 9-6 job and have a 
salary and go to bed at 9:30,” she said. “It’s this idea 
that you think you have to do the right thing at 22, 
and you have this pressure from your family, and 
you have to make the salary. Dude, you don’t at all. 
This is your one time in your life you are so free. You 
can literally work wherever, you can move wherever, 

you can do whatever. It doesn’t matter what I do at 
22, because as long as I have some form of income 
and a story to tell, that can make me a writer.”
Shevchek was the only other English alum I talked 
with. Immediately, I felt a sense of camaraderie — 
that we were “in this together.” She unapologetically 
embraced her major and her choices, never wavering 
in her decision to choose liberal arts and work as a 
waitress. I listened to her story with admiration and 
clung to her parting words of advice. 
“Do what you want, live your life,” she said. 
“You’re going to be 21 when you graduate? Oh my 
god, dude, you got the whole world in your hands. If 
it’s meant to work, it’ll work.” 
U

niversity alum Pat Ray received a Bachelor 
of Science in Computer Science through 
LSA in 2018. He now works for Domino’s 
Pizza Corporate Team in their I.T. department.
“Yeah, it’s kinda funny, a lot of people, when I say 
I work at Domino’s, they’re like ‘Aw stick with it, 
man,’” Ray said.
Logically, I know it’s the company and not 
the major, but I couldn’t help but compare this 
comment to the ones I receive when I tell people I’m 
an English major. “What are you going to do with 
that, live in your parents’ basement?” I guess even 
computer science majors can’t escape the stigma of 
a liberal arts school. 
At his side gig, however, Ray leads a very different 
life than the one at work. When he’s not at the 
office, he can be found splitting his time playing in 
five different bands and running a concert booking 
company out of his bedroom. 
Because he received a degree through LSA, 
Ray had to fulfill the 30-credit distribution 
requirement, including courses in humanities, math 
and quantitative reasoning. Ray largely credits 
these classes for giving him the skills he needed to 

navigate life after college. 
“I was able to use some of the stuff I learned in 
creative writing to help with writing songs. It’s 
been nice having math and statistics to help with 
finances, too,” Ray said. 
Ray seems to have embraced his diverging career 
paths. In explained how he guilts his boss and 
co-workers into going to shows. When I asked him 
about cutting back on his I.T. career and focusing 
more on music, it felt like I struck a chord. 
“That’s something I’d like to do; I’ve thought 
about it a lot. I want to, at some point, maybe in a 
year or two, save up some money from work, take 
a year off and focus on the booking group and my 
band,” he said. 
While talking with Ray, I couldn’t help but 
feel envious. A directly applicable job right after 
graduation and a money-making hobby on the 
side? It sounded ideal to me. I asked Ray if he ever 
imagined himself doing what he is doing now. 
“It’s definitely what I wanted to do. I think I’m 
kinda surprised with myself, that I’ve been able to 
pull it off,” he replied. 
Can that be attributed to personal skills like 
organization, time management or even luck? Or 
can liberal arts take the credit — preparing Ray with 
a broad range of classes and topics from EECS 281 
to “Video Game Music.” Ray’s path after college is 
reflected in his final bits of advice to me. 
“I’d say work hard and don’t be afraid to take 
chances. … Prove that you’re a hard worker, and 
trust in what you’re doing, and don’t be afraid to 
take a risk,” Ray said.
B

oth Shevchek and Ray used the University 
Career Center while they were at Michigan, 
with varying degrees of success. At career 
fairs, Shevchek confessed she felt out of place 
as a liberal arts major, while Ray learned about 

his current I.T. role by meeting with a Domino’s 
recruiter at one. 
UCC Director Kerin Borland, sat down with me 
for an interview and offered a different perspective 
on undergraduate majors. 
“The major is a field of study; the person is the 
one who’s going to be doing the job,” Borland said. 
There is no unmarketable major; there might be 
some unmarketable people, but most times that’s 
correctable.”
Before I talked with Borland, I had a chip on my 
shoulder. I badly wanted her to confirm my notion 
that liberal arts majors have a more diverse skill sets 
than other pre-professional majors like engineering 
or nursing. Instead, she corrected my prejudices.
“See, we don’t think like that. There are skills 
that are going to be transferable to a professional 
setting that are gotten through every academic 
experience,” Borland said. “The type of skill may be 
different, but each academic discipline is going to 
provide transferable skills.”
When I told her my goal of securing a job before 
Christmas break, she cautioned me against setting 
a deadline. 
“Don’t put that pressure on yourself,” Borland 
said. “We’re not looking for the perfect job, 
we’re looking for a really great opportunity that 
capitalizes on existing interests and skills and 
allows for growth to be a stepping stone to the next 
great opportunity. That’s how careers are built — 
one great opportunity after another.” 
The LSA Opportunity Hub is another source for 
internship and career advice. Created specifically 
for LSA students, the Hub aims to work with 
students throughout their time in undergrad. Kierra 
Trotter, director of student engagement at the Hub, 
talked me through her perspective on liberal arts.

Trotter feels that liberal arts is truly 
an education, not training. “If someone 
is looking for a broader education that 
is not going to prepare them just for one 
particular job, but prepare them for a 
lifetime of multiple careers, then an LSA 
degree really can be a way for someone 
to go,” she said. 
During our interview, Trotter was 
careful not to downplay the other 
colleges on campus. She said she’s 
always surprised to see what students 
do with their major after they graduate, 
in a good way. 
“The degree that you’re getting here, 
regardless of the major, sets you up to 
be able to exercise so many different 
skills and areas of knowledge,” Trotter 
said. 
I unloaded all my worries and 
anxiety about finding a job after I 
graduate. “Sometimes half the battle 
… is to figure out what is it that you 
want,” she said.
D

ylan Lange, however, knew 
exactly 
what 
he 
wanted. 
Graduating in 2019 with a 
BBA from the Ross Business School 
and a minor in global media studies, 
Lange did not follow the traditional 
Ross recruiting route. After graduation, 
Lange moved to Los Angeles and spent 
two-and-a-half months applying for 
jobs before landing a role as an assistant 
to a talent agent at Paradigm Talent 
Agency. 
Over those 75 days, Lange interviewed 
at five of the seven major agencies, and 
with each rejection he found himself 
wondering if he had made a mistake. 
“There were definitely times where 
I was like, ‘Yeah, totally, let’s go down 
a different route. If I wanna get back to 
this down the road then I will.’ It was 
something I was thinking about, for 
sure,” Lange said. 
“Well, it sounds like you’re happy 
with what you’re doing now,” I said. 
“Are you?”
“I’m glad you asked,” he said. “No, 
I’m so not happy with what I’m doing.” 
Think scheduling meetings, answering 
phones and getting yelled at every day 
by a very intense boss. Lange went on 
to explain that in Hollywood “everyone 
starts out as an assistant, unless your 
uncle is George Clooney.” 
To me, the idea of moving across 
the country without a job or place to 
stay sounds terrifying. The instability! 
And to hate your job after months of 
searching and years of education feels 
like some sort of sick joke. But maybe 
that’s what people think when I tell 
them I’m an English major. Or maybe 
it reminds them of their first job after 
graduating. 
“I think (with) any job, and especially 
entry-level, you’re gonna have great 
things that you’re excited about, and 
you’re going to have things you’re not 

excited about, things you’re gonna have 
to work harder on,” Lange said. 
Lange’s 
advice 
was 
refreshingly 
simple: “Stay positive. At the end of 
the day, it’s just a job. If you don’t 
find the perfect job for your first job, 
you’re gonna find a job that you love 
eventually. Whatever you do, make it a 
step forward for you in some way.” 
A

t the Alumni Association of the 
University of Michigan, Louise 
Jackson, 
associate 
director 
of the Alumni Career Program, Louise 
Jackson, oversees the career program 
available to the more than 600,000 
living alumni. 
“We try to serve all our alumni as 
much as we can, as well as in concert 
with our colleagues on campus,” says 
Jackson. 
Jackson stated in an email that 
there are over 100,000 members of the 
University Alumni Association. Despite 
the push for membership, the career 
programs are open to any University 
graduate.
“Our 
job 
seekers 
are 
typically 
underemployed, unemployed,” Jackson 
wrote. “They’re, in many cases, under 
significant financial restraint. As a 
result of that, we have made the very 
intentional decision to make all of our 
programs available to all alumni, with 
only one or two member benefits.” 
One 
program 
the 
association 
provides is a virtual Career Change 
program that guides alumni through 
identifying 
strengths 
and 
skills, 
defining their ideal career, finding new 
career possibilities and creating an 
action plan. This program also serves 
as a metric for measuring how often 
alumni are changing the course of their 
careers. 
“We have seen, as a result of that 
program, that our alumni are pivoting 
careers earlier than they were in the 
past,” Jackson said. “(Millenials and 
Gen Z) are only in jobs for 2-3 years 
versus the typical ‘old-school’ where 
you’re at a job for 10-15 yrs.” 
Jackson attributes this change to a 
shift in employee expectations.
“There’s less of a focus on loyalty 
for the specific employer and less 
dependence 
on 
the 
employer 
for 
determining the career path,” she 
said. “A lot of alumni and individuals 
are realizing that … they’re the people 
who have to create their future. As 
such, they’re not depending on their 
employer 
to 
provide 
that 
career 
development.”
U

niversity alum John Wang 
is 
still 
searching 
for 
his 
passion. Wang graduated in 
2003 with a triple major in Philosophy, 
Biopsychology and Cognitive Science, 
and Mathematical Physics. The summer 
after graduation, he took car mechanic 
courses 
at 
Washtenaw 
Community 

College and later moved to Texas. He 
made money gambling online, playing 
pool and going door-to-door selling 
water. 
 In 2005, he enrolled at Yale Law 
School and graduated with a dual 
degree 
in 
law 
and 
business. 
He 
confessed to me, “To be frank, I’m not 
a very great student in some ways. I 
really hate classes.” 
After working at a prestigious law 
firm in Manhattan for a couple of years, 
Wang quit to run a marathon in Paris. 
Fast forward through a couple of failed 
start-ups and business partnerships 
to today, Wang now operates Queens 
International Night Market in New 

York. QINM attracts 10,000 people every 
Saturday and celebrates the cultural 
diversity of New York and Queens with 
independent vendors selling food, art 
and merchandise along with small-scale 
performances. 
Given 
his 
employment 
history, 
I asked if he thinks 
he’ll stick with Queens 
Night Market. 
“I have no idea. I’ve 
been telling everyone 
every 
year, 
half-
jokingly, that, ‘This 
is my last year. I can’t 
do it anymore.’” This fall will mark 
the end of Queen Night Market’s fifth 
season. “There’s always this question in 
the back of my head which is ‘What am I 
gonna do when I grow up,’ and I realize 

I’m nearly forty now,” Wang said.
I wondered aloud if Philosophy, 
Biopsychology and Cognitive Science, 
and Mathematical Physics have any use 
in his day-to-day life. He laughed and 
said maybe in some 
abstract way, but “to 
be quite frank, I’ve 
forgotten to how to do 
99 percent of what I was 
doing 
in 
theoretical 
mathematical physics.” 
 
He 
followed 
up 

by saying he uses his Washtenaw 
Community 
College 
car 
mechanic 
training more than anything else. His 
parting words to me were peppered 
with “I don’t knows” and long pauses. 
He joked that he probably wasn’t the 
best person to be giving career advice, 
but I disagree. 
“Life is long,” he said. “If you’re happy, 
great; if not, take risks. Who cares if it’s 
related to your major or not?”
I

n a way, I’m comforted by these 
stories. Even more reassuring is 
the beautiful block ‘M’ soon to 
be stamped on my diploma — a symbol 
that represents my work ethic and the 
universal gold standard of all University 
graduates. 
Yet, as with 
many of my 
peers, 
the 
question 
of 
what life holds 
after I throw 
my graduation 
cap 
remains 
unanswered. 
When I set out to answer this 
question, I was searching for validation. 
I wanted to know that deciding on a 
liberal arts degree was the right choice. 
Now, I recognize my bias as an English 
major — it was my own self-doubt that 

made me desperate to prove liberal arts 
was worthy of respect. 
After talking to the alumni, not one 
of them voiced regret about pursuing a 
liberal arts degree from the University. 
All of them admitted 
to 
doubting 

themselves 
or 
feeling lost at one 
point or another. But 
is that particular to 
the experience of a 
liberal arts major, 
or is it just being 
human? 
When 
I 
think back to all those New Yorkers, 
radiating confidence, I have to believe 
there’s some part of them that questions 
their path. That “making it” in NYC isn’t 
perfectly linear.

W

hen I was 16 years old, I read 
an article about Modern 
Family star Ariel Winter’s 
breast reduction surgery, which took her 
from a size 32F to a 34D. “It’s amazing 
to finally feel right,” she said in an 
interview with Glamour. “This is how 
I was supposed to be.” Two years later, 
I sat on my boyfriend’s bed, my arms 
defensively crossed over my own 30F 
chest, realizing that I didn’t feel right at 
all. 
“Are you still planning on getting that 
breast reduction? I thought about it when 
I saw how bad the stretch marks are,” he 
asked, gesturing to my naked chest. 
“Maybe,” I swallowed the word 
carefully as though it could break. 
Instead of reveling in an intimate 
moment, he was pointing out the ugly 
marks on my breasts — my biggest 
insecurity. 
Were 
his 
words 
from 
moments before — calling me sexy — all 
pretend? I pressed two thin arms over 
my heavy chest as my face grew red and 
I fought the urge to cry. I wished he’d 
never look at me again. 
He didn’t realize how deep his words 
cut, they burned inside of me for weeks. 
He was 19, older than me, and the 
first person who felt entitled to have 
an opinion on my body. We were the 
definition of “it’s complicated” and the 
on and off state of our relationship made 
my potential breast reduction surgery 
something I didn’t want to discuss with 
him. His words made me sink into his 
navy-blue sheets in humiliation. 
My body— a feminine, imperfect thing 
— was worth nothing to him but a dig at 
its imperfections. I felt like I was nothing 
beyond my boobs. 
After that, I knew I’d have the 
surgery. A size 30F bra on a 5-foot-3 
frame, I wanted to live unrestricted by 
the attributes disrupting my every day 
— both physically and emotionally. I 
needed for someone, anyone, to see past 
them. When I first met that boyfriend, I 
believed he wanted to be with me past 
my chest. Yet he was still surprised 
when I told him I wanted a breast 
reduction. Like so many of my peers 
and acquaintances, he wondered why 
a young girl with a small frame would 
want to erase her breasts — something 
other people pay to have enlarged. 
Despite how he treated me, I had 
a weak spot for his humor and dark 
brown eyes. They’d won me over 
instantly — but 6 months later, I was 
desperately struggling to become the 
person he wanted, not realizing this 
was unattainable. Between the internal 
struggle with my physical appearance 
and the yo-yo of our toxic relationship, I 
worried I was nothing but a body. 
At 18, I became an expert at hiding my 
breasts and feelings — in life and social 

media. On Instagram, I refrained from 
posting anything revealing. I wanted 
my life to appear untroubled and light 
as air. As I struggled with my body, I 
hid behind feigned smiles and a facade 
of confidence. With a Big Ten college 
education, sorority sisters and an older 
boyfriend, I made myself look like I was 
happy. If you vaguely knew me through 
images on your phone screen, you never 
would’ve known that I couldn’t get 
dressed in the morning because of the 
internal battle I was fighting. 
Immediately following our break-
up we reunited in a vicious cycle. The 
constant push and pull of our relationship 
had me in a fragile emotional state. I 
dreaded waking up because I dreaded 
getting dressed. I couldn’t run, because 
wearing two sports bras left bloody 
marks on my skin. I couldn’t go to the 
beach because bathing suits just didn’t 
fit. Shopping — from searching for prom 
dresses to trying to find a shirt to fit me 
— became a nightmare I avoided. My 
friends and my boyfriend simply did not 
understand. But on social media, I could 
be instantly desired, liked and affirmed 
without struggle. 
After he mentioned the stretch marks, 
I posted a picture of myself at a football 
game in September, still tan from 
summer, smiling. It was the first time I 
used Instagram as a ploy to make believe 
my sadness away. I didn’t even realize 
what I was doing until after the photo 

uploaded and I watched it gather likes 
from my screen. 
In the photo, I didn’t look like a girl 
who despised her body and felt like a 
stranger in her skin. The warm glow of 
the screen hit my face and I felt elated. 
I could imagine him, looking at the 
picture and falling in love with me, 
instantly regretting his harsh words. 
Whenever I was insecure about the body 
that subjected me to sexualization, or 
remembered I had stretch marks and 
imperfections that made me unlovable, I 
posted something and pretended to feel 
OK. 
My profile seemed untroubled — 
there was no room for mental illness 
or melancholia. It was my drug. Snap, 
scroll, post, affirm, feeling refreshed as 
I was bathed in the affection of digital 
hearts. I was more than huge boobs — I 
was worth commenting on.
On May 4, 2017 I had the six-hour 
surgery, making the choice to change my 
life. My mother and father waited, full of 
support and excitement in the lobby, and 
when I woke up and opened my eyes, my 
mother and I both burst into tears. I will 
forever be indebted to her for advocating 
for me during the process of insurance 
coverage and recovery. I felt freed from 
the oppression my chest had caused, but 
it still hadn’t been enough to free my 
mind. There was still weight there. 
The relationship had ended in April, yet 
I hadn’t stopped obsessively monitoring 

if he’d viewed or liked my Instagram 
page, or whether I was worth a number 
of likes or comments. Even at a new and 
improved size 32B, 7 pounds lifted off 
me, I had stretch marks. I lacked the 
confidence I needed to end my reliance 
on social media as a faulty crutch for 
self-love. I craved the affirmation that 
I received with each post; I wanted to 
prove that I was more than a body. 
What I didn’t realize? It wasn’t the 
world’s love I was after; it was my own. 
When I recovered, I put on a tank top. 
I was giddy in the way it fell gracefully 
over my new boobs. Though I still donned 
a clunky surgical bra and rows of deep 
red scars, I felt beautiful. My mom took a 
picture of me in sweatpants and the top, 
my face still puffy from the anesthesia 
with no makeup. I considered deleting 
the photograph. There was nothing 
exceptional or envy-worthy about it. But 
it wasn’t faux affirmation I was after 
by posting it. It wasn’t meant for an 
ex-boyfriend to see and call to profess 
his love. I didn’t spend hours selecting a 
filter or thinking up captions. I just hit 
post, and as I watched the photo upload, 
I recognized my right to choose. Just like 
with the surgery, I could navigate my 
own path because I’d never lose a battle 
about my own happiness. I put down my 
phone, wrapped my arms around my 
chest and exhaled — everything finally 
felt right.

I WAS AMAZED BY

IS SO MUCH MORE

THAN THE UPBEAT 

CITY LIFE OF ANN
