Housing disputes tend to 
be between a landlord and 
a tenant, but in LSA junior 
Samantha 
Goldstein’s 
and 
her roommates’ case, their 
disagreement 
found 
them 
allied with their landlord 
and fighting against their 
neighbor’s 
landlord. 
Now, 
Goldstein and her landlord, 
Kaveh Esmael, are speaking 
out about their neighbor’s 
abusive proprietor.
Goldstein 
and 
her 
six 
roommates live in a house 
on South University Avenue 
between Walnut and Linden 
streets, about a five-minute 
walk 
from 
campus. 
On 
March 25, Goldstein and her 

roommates notified Esmael, 
their 
landlord, 
that 
their 
water had stopped working 
and 
their 
basement 
had 
flooded. Esmael, manager of 
Ava Holdings LLC, checked on 
their property. He suspected 
the problem was larger than 
just a plumbing issue and 
called the Ann Arbor Public 
Works Department. 
According to Esmael, an 
Ann 
Arbor 
Public 
Works 
employee, 
whose 
name 
Esmael could not remember, 
responded to the property. The 
city employee determined the 
water main line had burst, but 
it also needed to be replaced 
due to the 2018 revised Lead 
and Copper Rule. 

S. Jack Hu is the current vice 
president for research at the 
University of Michigan, but will be 
joining the University of Georgia as 
its next vice president for academic 
affairs and provost beginning July 
1. Hu has spent the past 30 years 
at Michigan, first as a masters and 
doctoral student (’86, ’90), then 
as a faculty member. He is a J. 
Reid and Polly Anderson professor 
of manufacturing, professor of 
mechanical 
engineering 
and 
professor 
of 
industrial 
and 
operations engineering. Prior to his 
role as vice president for research, 
Hu served as the associate dean 

for academic affairs and the 
associate dean for research and 
graduate education in the College of 
Engineering. The Michigan Daily 
sat down for an interview with Hu 
to discuss his time at the University 
as he reflects on his academic and 
administrative career.
The Michigan Daily: As your 
time at Michigan comes to an end, 
how do you feel?
Jack Hu: I’m not completely 
leaving Michigan — I have a 
few students, I have a few active 
grants, so those will continue in 
some way. But as a graduate of 
the University, I will always be 
affiliated, associated with the 
University. I may be departing 
from here, but the University will 

never leave me.
TMD: In this position, what 
are you the most proud of while 
you have been here?
JH: I would say I changed the 
culture somewhat in a number of 
areas. We (the Office of Research) 
really instilled a service attitude, 
and I think in our value statement 
we have the word ‘altruistic.’ 
The words we use are that we 
take joyful satisfaction in faculty 
success, so I think that really is 
what we do: supporting faculty, 
catalyzing 
research. 
I 
think 
Michigan has done well as the 
top public research university 
for seven years in a row, in spite 
of challenges with uncertainty 
in federal support for research. 

We tried to diversify sources 
of funding, tried to have more 
support from industry, from 
foundations and from individuals 
… together, the University has 
done well. The reputation is always 
excellent, other universities — big 
and small, good and not so good, 
they all come to Michigan to 
benchmark. Whether we’re doing 
the right thing or not, people come 
to us, but I think we are doing the 
right things. Maintaining that 
leadership role as the top public 
research university, of course 
credit goes to faculty. If they’re 
not writing grants, they’re not 
doing research — we would not be 
as successful.

Rackham 
student 
Cherline 
Bazile won the 2019 Paul & 
Daisy Soros Fellowship for New 
Americans, making her one of 30 
students across the country to 
be selected for the scholarship. 
The PD Soros Fellowship offers 
$90,000 
to 
high-achieving 
immigrants 
or 
children 
of 
immigrants to pursue a graduate 
degree in any field of study in the 
United States. Since its founding 
in 1997, 12 University of Michigan 
graduates have been selected for 
the award.
Bazile, who was raised by 
Haitian immigrants in Florida, 
earned a bachelor’s degree in 
English at Harvard University 
before coming to the University. 
Currently, she is pursuing a Master 
of Fine Arts in creative writing and 
is in the process of writing a novel.
Bazile said she is grateful for the 
support system that helped give 
her strength to succeed, especially 
because systemic barriers like 
poverty and lack of opportunity 
often stand in the way of many 
immigrants 
or 
first-generation 
students seeking higher education.

The presentation began with 
McGillivray defining PFAS and 
identifying its properties and uses. 
Known as “forever chemicals,” 
PFAS is a class of chemicals that 
is waterproof, greaseproof and 
fireproof. They are often found 
in 
industrial 
and 
consumer 
products such as fire fighting 
foam, non-stick cookware and 
stain-resistant fabrics.
McGillivray then discussed 
the health risks associated with 
PFAS, such as cancer and immune 
system weakening.

On 
Tuesday 
evening, 
the 
University of Michigan Central 
Student 
Government 
held 
its second-to-last meeting of 
the semester in the Michigan 
League to discuss resolutions for 
moving Assembly meetings to 
Thursday evenings and codifying 
Wolverine Consulting Group, a 
free consulting service provided 
by CSG to student organizations. 
The Assembly also approved a 
resolution 
organizing 
healthy 
snack distribution in campus 
libraries during finals week and 
voted on changes to its election 

complaint filing period and its 
operating procedures. 
LSA freshman Sam Braden 
proposed a resolution for first 
reads 
that 
suggested 
CSG 
meetings be held on Thursdays 
starting at 7 p.m. instead of on 
Tuesdays starting at 7:30 p.m. The 
resolution, authored by Braden 
and Engineering freshman Carla 
Voigt, states the current meeting 
time is at a time when students 
may have class. The resolution also 
notes CSG meetings sometimes 
run past midnight, which may 
pose safety concerns as members 
walk home late at night. 
At 
the 
meeting, 
Braden 
explained he looked through 

the LSA Course Guide to find 
how many 8:30 a.m. classes 
were 
offered 
each 
weekday. 
Braden emphasized moving CSG 
meetings to Thursday evenings 
would be beneficial as he claims 
there are more morning classes 
Monday through Thursday than 
on Friday.
“I did the math: There’s more 
than 
2,000 
classes 
Monday, 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
morning at 8:30 a.m. … but there’s 
only 700 classes that start at 8:30 
a.m. on Friday,” Braden said. “… 
To me, that’s a pretty compelling 
reason to change the CSG meeting 
day. The most important reason 
any of us are here are academics 
and classes we’re taking.” 
Braden’s 
resolution 
faced 
opposition 
from 
several 
members of the Assembly. 
Some members said the half-
hour time change in Braden’s 
resolution is not significant 
enough 
to 
address 
safety 
concerns related to meetings 
that run late into the night, and 
suggested other measures such 
as walking and ridesharing 
groups. Other members said 
they ran for CSG positions 
knowing meetings would be 
held 
on 
Tuesday 
evenings 
and expressed concern they 
might not be able to attend if 
CSG meetings were held on a 
different day.
LSA freshman Sujin Kim 
noted a similar resolution to 
change the CSG meeting time 
was met with controversy and 
ultimately rejected in the 22nd 
meeting of the Eighth Assembly. 
Kim suggested Braden should 
specifically address concerns 
brought up in discussion of the 
past resolution.
The Assembly then voted 
unanimously 
to 
pass 
a 
resolution for CSG members 

to distribute healthy snacks to 
students 
in 
various 
libraries 
on campus during finals week. 
Authored by Kim and Rackham 
student Hayden Jackson, the 
resolution 
would 
authorize 
CSG to spend $590 on coffee, 
healthy snacks and Green Books. 
These would then be distributed 
to 
students 
in 
the 
Shapiro 
Undergraduate 
Library 
the 
evening of April 22, the Shapiro 
Undergraduate Library and the 
Fishbowl the evening of April 24 
and the Duderstadt Center the 
evening of April 25.
Engineering 
junior 
Zeke 
Majeske, 
previous 
Wolverine 
Consulting Group vice chair for 
external affairs, then introduced 
a resolution he authored to codify 
WCG within CSG. According to 
Majeske, WCG can be useful in 
helping 
student 
organizations 
achieve a variety of initiatives, 
offering 
advice 
on 
member 
recruitment 
and 
retention, 
executive 
board 
structure, 
branding 
and 
marketing, 
fundraising and event planning. 
Majeske expressed WCG services 
are 
in 
demand 
by 
student 
organizations and are a good 
utilization of CSG resources.
“(WCG) is a really good way 
for CSG time and effort and funds 
to be used to really interact with 
the student body,” Majeske said. 
“Everyone who interacts with us 
always tells this is such a great 
service, and I want to get it a little 
more permanent within the CSG 
governing documents. I want to 
grow the group in the next year 
and couple years.”
According to Majeske, current 
demand for WCG services exceeds 
the organization’s capabilities. 
Majeske’s 
resolution 
suggests 
extending WCG by codifying it as 
a commission with a chair elected 
by the Assembly and 12 members 

SPRINGFEST BRINGS MUSIC TO CAMPUS 

ON THE DAILY: ‘STUDENTS OF UMICH’ TO RAISE AWARENESS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: PROFS CHARGED WITH 
SEXUAL HARASSMENT

To 
commemorate 
Sexual 
Assault 
Awareness 
Month, 
Students of UMich will post a 
series of stories about sexual 
assault 
on 
Instagram. 
The 
student 
organization 
was 
founded by Information junior 
Somya Bhagwagar and has almost 
4,500 followers on Instagram. 
The account seeks to “act as a 

microphone,” allowing students 
to share their stories without 
censorship. 
Bhagwagar decided to feature 
stories about sexual assault after 
a number of people brought up 
the issue in interviews for her 
blog.
“Honestly, 
it 
wasn’t 
on 
purpose,” Bhagwagar said. “I 
started doing my usual Students 
of UMich, and it kind of just 
came out. Surprisingly, I found 

that a lot of people were starting 
to talk about it, and I questioned 
why they were talking about it, 
and I realized that it was Sexual 
Assault Awareness Month. And 
then I reordered the stories for 
it to be in the same month, but it 
wasn’t intentional.”
Bhagwagar said she hopes the 
stories will allow her audience to 
empathize with the survivors.
“A 
lot 
of 
people 
don’t 
understand or don’t care about 

it because they’ve never been in 
the shoes of someone who has 
been 
assaulted,” 
Bhagwagar 
said. “A lot of women have been 
in that place, but the thing about 
stories is they’re so unique, but 
so relatable at the same time. So 
putting yourself in someone else’s 
shoes … who has gone through 
that is a really scary process, and 
it’s a way for you to feel those 
struggles that you once thought 
were unfathomable.”

April 16, 1983
Charges of sexual harassment 
this year have led to the resignations 
of two University faculty members 
and formal disciplinary hearings for 
two other professors, according to 
University officials.
Virginia Nordby, director of the 
Office of Affirmative Action, said 
her office also is looking into about 
10 other cases of harassment which 

she terms
“Serious.”
IN ONE CASE pending in 
Rackham 
Graduate 
School, 
a 
medical school professor “did in 
the laboratory sometimes refer 
to women as [expletive]... did on 
occasion grab or twist the arms of 
(a female student) did make sexually 
suggestive gestures, and did write 
instructions to (the student) on a 

notepad picturing female genitalia,” 
according to the confidential report 
of a faculty review committee.
The professor admitted, according 
to the report, that he “twice caused 
the release of potentially dangerous 
nitrogen tetroxide, once squirted (the 
student) in the eyes with acetone, 
and on one or more occasions left 
radioactive materials about in ways 
that were potentially dangerous.”

The 
three-member 
Rackham 
Appeals Board concluded that the 
medical school professor, who was 
advising the female student on her 
doctoral dissertation when the 
alleged incidents occurred, “should 
be removed from the roles of the 
graduate faculty for five years,” 
which would keep him off research 
committees and ban him from 
working with Rackham students.

Daily Staff Reporter 

selected 
through 
application, 
and alloting $2,500 to $3,500 
to WCG per a semester. Under 
Majeske’s proposed resolution, 
WCG leadership can unanimously 
decide to transfer funds to student 
organizations 
receiving 
WCG 
services. 
Students 
voiced 
concerns 
with 
Majeske’s 
resolution, 
stating they preferred to keep 
all student organization funding 
through the Student Organization 
Funding 
Committee, 
a 
CSG 
program 
granting 
funds 
to 
student organizations through an 
application process. 
In addition, CSG discussed, 
voted 
on 
and 
passed 
three 
resolutions written by Rackham 
student Austin Glass to improve 
CSG’s administrative procedures 
and internal operations. Glass’ 
suggestions for change include 
electing candidates through a 
ranked choice runoff system, 
clarifying voting rights of the 
speaker and committee chairs 
and regulating when resolution 

authors may edit their resolutions, 
among several others. 
The Assembly also approved 
a resolution limiting the election 
complaint filing period to only 
before election results are released 
for all positions except the special 
prosecutor. According to Glass, 
the author of this resolution, the 
change would prevent complaints 
by those upset with the election 
results from undermining them.
During 
the 
announcements 
and matters arising portion of 
the meeting, Glass thanked the 
Assembly for their time and 
reaffirmed 
his 
dedication 
to 
improve CSG.
“I freely am willingly debted 
to everyone here for taking 
advantage of your time this 
evening,” Glass said. “I appreciate 
your valuable contributions and 
I also do not intend nor do I take 
for granted your support … I will 
continue to act responsibly and 
responsively with that authority, 
and we will continue to have these 
productive conversations.”

“This year we really wanted 
to build up the festival,” Singh 
said. “So really focusing on 
what 
different 
sections 
we 
want, so arts and music, live 
service, sustainability and so on 
… . We really wanted to focus on 
bringing out more interactive 
organizations — we want this 
to be more about showcasing 
what exactly your org has to 
offer to the University and what 
community value you bring to 
campus.”
Singh also said the group 
invited Ann Arbor artisans to 
showcase their businesses for 
the first time this year.
“This year we really tried 
to reach out to artisans — that 
section of the festival is new, 
we’ve never had that before,” she 
said. “We tried to find smaller 
sellers 
and 
student 
sellers 
that might want to come to 
SpringFest.”
The artisan corner of the 

festival featured familiar local 
stores, 
including 
University 
Flower Shop and The M Den, as 
well as specialty boutiques for 
soaps and art. Stacey Hansen, 
owner and artist of Slow My 
Flow Art boutique, said it was 
meaningful to her that the 
student organization worked to 
include local businesses.
“They reached out going, ‘Hey, 
we’re running this and it would 
be a wonderful opportunity,’” 
Hansen said. “It’s definitely good 
for local businesses to be able 
to get their name out there, and 
you, the students — you guys are 
the shopping future.”
SpringFest also showcased 
student-run 
businesses 
like 
Star Laces, created by LSA 
sophomore Jordan Furr and 
Business 
sophomore 
Julia 
Reguera, which makes shoe laces 
featuring gender pronouns.
Reguera 
said 
Star 
Laces’ 
shoelaces are a fashionable way 
to make a social statement.
“As a cis person, it’s a really 
good way to show you’re an ally 
and it can help bridge the gap 
between not wanting to assume 

someone’s 
gender 
expression 
but also not wanting to target 
someone by asking,” Reguera 
said.
Furr elaborated further on the 
original goal and inspiration for 
the project.
“I wanted to make something 
that was fashionable so not only 
trans people want to be wearing 
their 
pronouns,” 
Furr 
said. 
“These have a very street style 
sort of energy and it’s just really 
exciting because there’s a lot 
of cis people who want to wear 
them and are really interested in 
them.”
The lines for trendy food 
trucks 
like 
Shimmy 
Shack, 
Regina’s Food Truck and the 
Detroit BBQ Company extended 
down State Street.
Student 
organizations 
promoting 
health, 
wellness 
and sustainable food practices

also 
attended 
SpringFest, with representatives 
from 
groups 
including 
the 
campus farm and Counseling 
and Psychological Services.
Another of these organizations 
was CAPS In Action, an group 

for 
students 
committed 
to 
improving the holistic health 
of the campus community. LSA 
freshman Alyssa Moore, a CAPS 
In Action volunteer, spoke on 
self-appreciation.
“I really like these tabling 
events because for mental health 
outreach, it’s just really nice 
to be able to see people on the 
street and see how much they 
enjoy spinning the wheel and 
saying something good about 
themselves.”
MUSIC 
Matters’ 
invited 
multiple local artists to perform 
during 
the 
daytime 
festival 
before A$AP Ferg’s nighttime 
concert. Ben Robertson, lead 
singer for the band Leland Blue, 
spoke about the experience of 
performing at SpringFest for the 
first time.
“It’s our second time playing 
in Ann Arbor and I think this 
time was a lot more fun because 
it’s right downtown, really in the 
heart of the city,” he said. “This 
was cool because it was right 
by the campus and I felt more 
immersed in Ann Arbor as a 
city.”

The rule was implemented 
by the state of Michigan as 
a result of the Flint water 
crisis in order to establish 
stricter lead in drinking water 
protections. Given the issue, 
the responsibility for fixing 
the water main line falls on 
the city of Ann Arbor. The 
city would need to replace the 
pipe entirely, but Esmael was 
told their property would be 
put on a waiting list. As of two 
weeks ago, there were still 
two houses before them on 
the list that require the same 
replacement.
According to Esmael and 
Goldstein, the city employee 
asked the residents of their 
neighboring 
property, 
a 
house managed by Carlson 
Properties, if they paid for 
their own utilities. If utilities 
were paid for by the landlord, 
then the landlord’s permission 
would be required. However, 
the 
residents 
confirmed 
they paid for utilities and 
the city employee received 
verbal 
permission 
from 
the 
neighbors 
to 
connect 
Goldstein’s house to their 
water system. The parties 
established an agreement that 
Goldstein and her roommates 
would pay for the water they 
used.
For several days, Goldstein 
said the issue seemed to be 
resolved, at least until the city 
could replace the pipe. Their 
water worked until the Friday 
before Spring Break. Esmael 
then received a call from a man 
who identified himself only as 
a representative of Carlson 
Properties. Esmael claims the 
man berated him, accused him 
of being a “water thief” and 
screamed profanities at him. 
Esmael told the man he could 
check with the city about the 
legality of the connection, but 
the man hung up the call. 
Allegedly, 
the 
representative from Carlson 
Properties 
unhooked 
Goldstein’s house from his 
property’s water system and 
took the spigot with him, 
leaving Goldstein and her 
roommates 
without 
water 
again.
“What he did was a gross 
violation 
of 
our 
rights,” 
Goldstein said. “Water is a 
human right. You can’t just 
turn off somebody’s water — 
it’s not okay.”
Nursing 
senior 
Olivia 
Hamilton 
resides 
in 
the 
house next to Goldstein’s, 
managed 
by 
Carlson 
Properties. Hamilton claims 
her landlord, Garret Carlson, 
who 
manages 
Carlson 
Properties, came to their 
house to fix a maintenance 
issue they were having when 
he 
saw 
the 
neighboring 
property, 
Goldstein’s 
house, was connected to his 
property’s 
water 
system. 
According 
to 
Hamilton, 
Carlson asked her roommate 
if she knew the neighbors 
were “stealing their water.” 
Although 
Hamilton’s 
roommate assured Carlson 
they had spoken with a city 
employee, 
Carlson 
called 
Esmael 
from 
Hamilton’s 
roommate’s cell phone and 
then told his tenant to block 
Esmael’s phone number.
“He 
basically 
told 
my 
roommate 
to 
block 
that 
number,” 
Hamilton 
said. 
“I was like, ‘That’s really 
unacceptable.’ 
I 
was 
like, 
‘Why did you even let him 
use your phone?’ That’s really 
sketchy.”
Esmael 
said 
a 
landlord 
has no right to interfere in 
an agreement between two 
tenants if the tenants pay 
for their utilities and the 
bill is in their names. While 
Esmael did not verify that 
the neighboring tenants pay 
for their own utilities, they 
verbally confirmed they do to 
the city employee. Hamilton 
confirmed to The Daily that 
she and her roommates pay 
for their own utilities, and 
on the website for Carlson 
Properties, there is a list of 
rules and regulations that 
directs all tenants to set up 
their own utilities.
“He has no right to say 
anything about the water,” 
Esmael said. 
According to Esmael, he 
contacted 
Paul 
Matthews, 
Ann Arbor assistant public 

works manager, and told him 
about the situation. Matthews 
then 
attempted 
several 
times 
to 
contact 
Carlson 
Properties to assure Carlson 
the connection was legal, but 
was not able to reach anyone. 
Esmael said his encounter 
with Carlson Properties was 
especially frustrating because 
instead of contacting him 
and sorting the situation out, 
Carlson Properties chose to 
shut off Goldstein’s water 
connection.
“This is a human rights 
violation,” 
Esmael 
said. 
“Water is the first necessity. 
You can’t use your power, your 
position or your influence 
with whoever you are to cut 
water on any human being.”
Carlson 
Properties 
and 
Garret 
Carlson 
did 
not 
respond to multiple calls and 
messages from The Daily.
Goldstein said she wanted 
to 
speak 
up 
about 
this 
experience because Carlson 
Properties manages several 
properties 
in 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Goldstein 
said 
seeing 
the 
way this company treated her 
landlord made her concerned 
for how they may be treating 
their tenants.
“I think there’s a general 
feeling on campus that Ann 
Arbor landlords can kind of 
drop the ball sometimes, and 
this is a prime example of 
landlords abusing their power 
and walking over students 
and 
taking 
advantage 
of 
students,” Goldstein said. “I 
think it’s important that we 
call out this bad behavior and 
keep them accountable.”
Hamilton 
said 
she 
and 
her 
roommates 
have 
had 
numerous issues with the 
property but claim Carlson 
is not responsive to their 
concerns. 
According 
to 
Hamilton, their washer and 
dryer have been broken for 
seven 
months. 
Hamilton 
claims Carlson was actually 
at their property the day he 
accused Esmael of stealing his 
properties’ water to look at 
the washer after they had to 
“bug him” about the issue.
In 
addition 
to 
other 
issues that Carlson ignored, 
Hamilton claims they also 
had a wasp infestation in their 
home, but Carlson would not 
address it until she got stung 
twice in her own bedroom. 
“I just sent him several 
messages — he won’t answer 
his phone,” Hamilton said. 
“And when he does come over, 
he’s just not listening to what 
you have to say. I don’t know 
what I should do. I don’t know 
if there’s someone I can tell, if 
there’s a housing department 
I can go to with issues. It’s 
been frustrating.”
Goldstein said she feels like 
there is no real system to hold 
landlords 
accountable. 
On 
the Ann Arbor city website, 
there is a page with rental 
housing 
services, 
which 
includes 
tenant 
resources. 
Through that page, Ann Arbor 
renters can file a complaint 
about a landlord and check 
that a rental property has 
been inspected by the city. 
However, students may not 
be aware of this resource. 
Goldstein said she believes 
young 
people, 
especially 
students like her, should feel 
comfortable speaking up for 
themselves.
“We’re students, we’re here 
to get an education,” Goldstein 
said. “Yes, we’re young, but 
it’s important we advocate for 
ourselves,” Goldstein said.
Currently, 
Goldstein’s 
house is connected to the 
water system of their other 
neighbor’s property. Esmael 
said 
the 
exchange 
with 
this other landlord was far 
different than his interaction 
with 
Carlson 
Properties. 
He said this other landlord 
volunteered to facilitate the 
connection because Esmael 
could not be present when 
the city returned to hook 
Goldstein’s 
house 
up 
to 
their other neighbor’s water 
system.
Goldstein praised Esmael 
for sticking up for her and 
her 
roommates. 
Esmael 
said he has children at the 
University of Michigan and 
as a landlord, and he tries to 
treat his tenants as he hopes 
other landlords would treat 
his kids.

RESEARCH
From Page 1A

The second area we have done 
well is change the culture in 
research compliance. We have 
a research safety committee 
— that committee works with 
faculty 
and 
students 
across 
campus, trying to improve the 
culture around research safety. 
We also strengthened an animal 
care and use program … In 2016 
and 2017, we went through a 
transformation of the program 
— 
integration, 
centralization 
… Through the integration we 
improved the centers of care, 
improved the consistency in the 
monitoring … Michigan now is 
recognized as a university who 
went through a transformation 
and are achieving excellence 
in animal care and use. So our 
staff now get invited by other 
universities 
and 
professional 
societies to teach them how 
to transform animal care and 
use programs. So those are 
just examples of what we do in 
research.
I think a third area is 
enhancing 
innovation, 
continuing to improve faculty 
engagement in innovation and 
entrepreneurship. I think our 

technology transfer every year 
we seem to do more, faculty 
reports more innovation … We 
spent a lot of effort by building 
interdisciplinary 
initiatives 
for research. When you bring 
multiple faculty from many 
different units together, to bring 
faculty from U-M Ann Arbor, 
Dearborn, Flint together so we 
spent a lot of effort cultivating 
the collaboration.
TMD: What is something you 
feel you have not quite completed 
or seen come to fruition?
JH: We want to create an 
innovation 
hub 
on 
campus. 
That is still a work in progress 
— we’re just at the beginning. 
Schools 
and 
colleges, 
they 
all 
have 
entrepreneurship 
programs, they’re distributed. 
It would be nice to have some 
common space where we could 
bring faculty startups, student 
startups together and also maybe 
have space for companies to 
locate, whether research centers 
or advanced offices. Some place 
that is central but closely tied 
with our academic operations. 
That’s something we just started 
discussing, but we’ll need a few 
years to really have a finalized 
plan.
TMD: Three decades is a 
significant amount of time — 

what made you stay here for so 
long?
JH: I never had to pursue 
any outside opportunities — 
different 
opportunities 
just 
came. I embraced those, tried 
to do my best in each and every 
leadership role, so I think 
that’s why I have been here. I 
mean the University and Ann 
Arbor of course — both are 
excellent. Outstanding academic 
reputation, outstanding quality 
of life, really can’t find too many 
combinations of such, not many 
universities that have such a 
combination. I would say it’s the 
quality of the faculty and the 
quality of the students that is a 
draw for outstanding faculty.
TMD: What are you most 
looking forward to in your new 
position at the University of 
Georgia?
JH: The senior vice president 
and provost has a very diverse 
set of responsibilities, so the vice 
president for research reports to 
the provost, in addition of course 
(to) education, faculty affairs, 
public engagement and also IT 
— information technology — 
they all report to the provost. 
In such a role, with such broad 
responsibilities, (it) will allow 
me to learn how a university 
operates in a much more holistic 

(sense) rather than just one area. 
I will be able to leverage my 
experience from Michigan — so 
research, faculty affairs, budget, 
space, graduate education — and 
also strengthen my leadership 
experience 
in 
undergraduate 
education because the University 
of 
Georgia 
does 
have 
an 
outstanding 
reputation 
for 
undergraduate education.
TMD: 
Is 
there 
anything 
else you want to add about the 
University or your time here?
JH: When I was associate 
dean for academic affairs in 
engineering, I helped recruit 
many 
faculty 
members 
to 
engineering, so now after 8 to 9 
years, they’re all doing extremely 
well, 
(everyone) 
sees 
them 
getting awards in the University, 
in other professional societies — 
that makes me very, very happy. 
Even though I was just part of 
the recruiting, I’m very proud of 
the faculty the University has.
The best research is… always 
at the leading edge, so you start 
something and then other people 
will follow and do the research. 
That process will never end, if 
you’re leading researchers at a 
leading research university we 
should be creating ideas and 
pursuing research in those. 

“I know a lot of people who 
just simply don’t know what’s 
possible or what they’re allowed 
and what they deserve, and 
that’s part of what we’re being 
told from the media, from the 
government,” Bazile said. “ ... 
I think ‘opportunity’ is a very 
loaded word — sometimes people 
see it as, ‘Everybody should 
pull themselves up from your 
bootstraps, everybody should be 
able to do it,’ and I think that’s very 
harmful and very wrong because 
some 
people 
have 
legitimate 
blockages to that.”
Paul and Daisy Soros, Jewish 
immigrants 
from 
Hungary, 
founded 
the 
fellowship 
to 

offer 
other 
immigrants 
and 
first-generation 
Americans 
opportunities to pursue higher 
education. 
Henry 
Dyson, 
director of the Office of National 
Scholarships 
and 
Fellowships, 
said the Soros family’s generosity 
continues to embody the values of 
the fellowship.
“They were part of a generation 
of Jewish immigrants that came 
to New York from Europe and 
found a new home there and 
were able to contribute vitally,” 
Dyson said. “I think that’s the 
heart of the Soros fellowship: the 
recognition that it’s successive 
waves of immigrants and children 
of immigrants that have really 
been major contributors towards 
the vitality and the drive and the 
creativity and the ingenuity of 
American industry and finance 

and culture.”
According to a press release 
from Craig Harwood, director 
of the PD Soros Fellowship, 
the applicant pool for the 2019 
cohort included more than 1,700 
candidates, resulting in a 1.7 
percent selection rate. The fellows 
originate from 19 countries and 
join distinguished past awardees 
like Fei-Fei Li, co-director of 
Stanford 
University’s 
Stanford 
Human-Centered 
Artificial 
Intelligence Institute, and Abdul 
El-Sayed, a University alum who 
ran as a Democratic candidate in 
Michigan’s 2018 gubernatorial 
primary election.
To be considered for the 
award, applicants must provide 
documentation 
showing 
that 
both parents were born outside 
of the U.S. as non-U.S. citizens. 

The PD Soros Fellowship requires 
applicants to submit three letters 
of recommendation and two essays 
describing what the scholarship 
would mean to them and why they 
are pursuing their chosen field of 
study.
Bazile attributed her success to 
her own work, but stressed how 
important it was for her to have 
supportive friends and family 
members during the application 
process.
“I do work hard, so (the awards) 
are often a product of the work 
I do, but also the people around 
me,” Bazile said. “I had a group of 
friends and we had a day where 
everyone would read my essays, 
and they’ve seen my essays for 
grad school, my essays for the 
fellowship, and probably some of 
them know the narratives more 
than I do. Not everybody has 
that, so I feel so lucky to have 
people in my life who are 
genuinely happy for me when 
good things come my way.”
Law School student Akash 
Patel, a 2016 recipient of the 
PD Soros Fellowship, said the 
scholarship is unique in that 
it provides awardees a similar 
kind of tight-knit community 
that stays with them once 
they’ve 
completed 
their 
graduate programs.
“Once you’re in, you get 
to be part of this really large 
immigrant 
family,” 
Patel 
said. “And it really feels like it 
and they really treat you like 
it. I feel like it’s something 
that people feel themselves, 
it’s 
something 
that 
the 
organization intentionally tries 
to cultivate and I definitely feel 
personally.”
Dyson said while applicants 
must 
have 
impressive 
qualifications and thoughtful 
essays to be considered for 
the fellowship, the selection 
ultimately comes down to fit.

I

t was a couple years ago, 
with my then high school 
girlfriend. She was going 
through a tough time — her 
father had been diagnosed 
with a terminal illness; her 
life turned upside down. I 
was there to support her in 
any way that I could. “Don’t 
worry,” I’d say. “I’m right 
here next to you. You aren’t 
gonna be alone in this.” She 
knew she could count on me. 
Mental illness got the best 
of her, however. Her initial 
sadness turned to anger and 
rage and frustration, grief to 
deep unrelenting desperation 
for her mind to be eased. 
Longing for control and quick 
hits of dopamine to help her 
through her struggles, my 
support became a crutch, and 
eventually, her addiction. I 
remember the day well. She 
had expressed she wanted to 
have sex. I did not. “But it’ll 
make me feel good,” she said, 
as she began to touch me. I 
didn’t want to. My body did 
what physically male bodies 
do when exposed to stimulus, 
and my courage disappeared. 
She did what she wanted, as 
my quiet objections of “No, 
stop” turned to only hearing 
her muffled moans and a 
“See, 
wasn’t 
that 
good?” 
when she was finished.
And here I am, years later, 
left to pick up the pieces. 
It’s been a decent bit of time 
here, we’ve since broken up, 
and I’ve met an incredible, 
beautiful, intelligent woman 
with whom I’d be lucky to 
spend a long, long time with, 
who supports my struggles 
mentally and is patient with 
the occasional lapses I have 
with 
sexual 
dysfunction. 
Dysfunction takes the form 
of 
different 
physiological 
hiccups. For myself, I find 
it difficult to climax, as 
what fills a lot of my mind 
during sex is anxiety. I have 
nightmares 
nearly 
every 
night of this particular scene 
in my mind, my ex-girlfriend 
on top of me, telling me that 

it’s what she wants, almost 
daring me to claim that my 
desires are as important as 
hers.
Therapy helps, but a lot of 
the pain, a lot of the struggle is 
the everyday anxiety. I’ll just 
be out at Potbelly Sandwich 
Shop 
by 
myself, 
eating 
lunch before my afternoon 
classes, and suddenly, I’m 
transported 
back 
to 
that 
night. Smelling her perfume 
transports my mind into that 
fight or flight response. Post 
traumatic stress disorder is 
not a simple disease that you 
can just ignore occasionally. 
You live with it; it becomes a 
part of you. Through therapy, 
you learn to “make the beast 
beautiful,” but even then, it 
never goes away. You learn to 
live with it.

The road is long and 
arduous, but it’s worth it. 
I find beauty in my life 
again. 
My 
friends, 
my 
family, all support me and 
my 
endeavors. 
I’m 
never 
truly alone, and I know that. 
Whether it’s a quick Costco 
run with my best friend, or 
a walk around campus with 
a couple of others, I always 
have someone I can talk to, 
to help carry the burden 
with me. But, once again, it’s 
always there. Especially at 
night, when I’m alone, and 
all I have are my thoughts. 
But, it’ll get better. I know 
it will, and I know that with 
work, with laughter, with 
intention and determination, 
this part of myself that I 
hate so thoroughly will, one 

day, become an even more 
beautiful part of my soul.
Meeting my partner was 
one of the most spectacular 
times of my life. I never 
thought I’d be able to have a 
healthy sexual relationship 
with a woman ever again. I 
still remember the night I 
told her what had happened 
to me. I was worried about 
what she would think or say. 
Once I was finished, she held 
me, and told me that she was 
there for me, and that we 
could be as patient with our 
sexual relationship as we 
wanted. That there was no 
rush, and she wasn’t with 
me for the sex, but because 
of who I am as a human. 
Being comforted not only 
physically, but emotionally, 
was 
so 
refreshing 
and 
changed how I viewed my 
own sexuality. I could be 
patient, and find comfort in 
that patience.
One 
in 
six 
men 
will 
be 
sexually 
assaulted 
at 
some point in their life. It 
doesn’t make us weak or less 
masculine — nor should it. 
Rather, we, as men, should 
encourage other men to speak 
up, to be courageous, share 
this burden with others and 
to attend therapy and take 
medication. There is such a 
thing as healthy masculinity, 
and we can find that in our 
fellow men, in comforting 
those 
who 
are 
having 
a 
rough time. Seeking help 
in a healthy way, wanting 
to 
be 
better, 
practicing 
empathy 
and 
compassion 
and caring for each other are 
ways of practicing healthy 
masculinity.

CAROLINE LLANES | COLUMN

Mind, body, boats
W

e’re 
four 
months 
into the year now, 
a time by which 
the 
majority 
of 
people 
have 
shed 
the 
shackles 
of 
their 
New 
Year’s 
resolutions. 
One 
common 
resolution 
that’s probably been 
abandoned by now 
is 
losing 
weight, 
whether 
it’s 
five 
pounds or 50. I’ve 
made countless New 
Year’s 
resolutions, 
but I’ve never explicitly made 
one about weight loss. This is 
interesting 
considering 
the 
contentious and tumultuous 
relationship with my body 
and my own weight, which 
for a very long time now I’ve 
never 
really 
talked 
about 
with anyone. Let’s see if I can 
explain it here.
In high school, I rowed 
competitively. We had practice 
for two to three hours a day, 
six days of the week. Every 
day before practice, we did 
a 
mile-long 
warm-up 
run, 
accompanied by sets of 50 to 
100 squats, jumpies, sit-ups, 
push-ups, jumping jacks and 
everything in between. We 
rowed in boats on the water 
most days, but one day a week 
was set aside as our “land 
day.” On land days, we would 
row on a machine, also called 
an erg, and do weights, often 
accompanied by a timed run. 
In short: It was a lot of work, 
and we had to eat accordingly. 
In high school, it felt like I 
was hungry all the time. I had 
a 64-ounce water bottle that 
I would drink in its entirety 
and then refill throughout the 
school day. I had a big lunch, 
accompanied 
by 
frequent 
snacks throughout the day so 
I could fuel up for practice 
later on. I’d come home from 
practice, 
and 
I 
would 
be 
starving. I would eat as much 
as I possibly could for dinner, 
then later on, I’d have a snack 
as I did homework. I saw food 
as fuel, and it was — it got 
me where I needed to go, and 
sustained my body as I put it 
through hell. I gained a ton 
of weight the year I started 
rowing, all of it muscle: I felt 
great, I felt strong and I felt 
like I was finally happy with 
my body because I was putting 
it 
through 
the 
impossible, 
and it not only survived, but 
thrived.
This happiness wouldn’t 
last long. My senior year, I 
sustained a lower back injury 
through 
a 
combination 
of 
overuse and overcompensating 
for weak ankles from my years 
of middle school soccer. I am 
the first to admit that I did not 
handle my injury the way that 
I should have. I prioritized 
rowing through the pain over 
taking time to heal out of fear 
of being seen as weak or lazy. 
My back never fully healed, 
and I still deal with pain today. 
Some days are better than 
others, and I’ve learned to deal 
with it, mostly by buying a 

very comfortable mattress pad 
— turns out, your back needs 
support at night when you 
sleep! It was tough, 
but I left rowing 
behind, and since 
I was no longer a 
competitive athlete, 
I had to change my 
relationship to food 
as well.
I 
no 
longer 
needed 
thousands 
and 
thousands 
of 
calories 
at 
every 
meal, 
and 
as 
it 
happens, I wasn’t hungry for 
them. I adjusted to dining hall 
food, and having access to that 
food at nearly all hours. As 
quickly as I gained weight when 
I started rowing, I lost that 
weight when I got to college. 
There would be days where 
all I would have was a glass 
of cranberry juice and some 
fruit snacks, and others where 
I would have three full meals 
in the dining hall. Food was 
no longer fuel, so it had little 
value to me. I ate when I was 
hungry, and sometimes I’d just 
forget with my busy schedule. 
Yet, once I moved off campus, 
I realized that cooking was 
not only necessary, but fun. I 
love trying new recipes, seeing 
what works and what doesn’t, 
experimenting with spices and 
flavors. Most of all, I love how 
communal cooking is. I love 
cooking with my boyfriend, 
having 
friends 
over 
and 
cooking meals for them, just 
making other people happy. 
But unfortunately, the journey 
doesn’t end here, as I have 
confronted more obstacles on 
the road to happiness with 
my diet. It is a struggle to find 
a balance for myself that is 
healthy in every facet. 

I have been lucky enough 
to experience rowing from 
multiple 
dimensions. 
A 
crucial part of any boat is the 
coxswain, a smaller person 
who sits either in the bow or 
stern of the boat. The coxswain 
is responsible for steering, 
directing 
practice, 
running 
drills 
and 
coaching 
the 
rowers, whether that’s giving 
them motivation or making 
corrections 
on 
their 
form 
and technique. When I got to 
the University of Michigan, I 
joined the men’s rowing team 
as a coxswain on a whim, just 
to see what it was like. If I 
hated it, I’d quit, and if I liked 
it, great. After not rowing 
for a whole summer, being 
back in a boat was thrilling. 
It made me realize just what 
I missed so much about the 

sport, and it gave me a second 
home on campus, a family and 
teammates who had my back. 
And here was where I started 
changing my relationship to 
food yet again.
Coxswains are small. It’s 
a part of the job description. 
They’re shorter than their 
rowers, and weigh anywhere 
from 90 to 130 pounds, and 
have to fit into the tiny seats 
built for them in various boats. 
Certain races even have weight 
minimums 
for 
coxswains, 
where they weigh in and are 
given bags of sand to make 
up for missing weight. For 
example, if a race’s minimum 
weight for coxswains is 120 
pounds, 
a 
coxswain 
who 
weighs 110 will have to carry 
10 pounds of sand. It’s all very 
technical and a part of the rules 
of racing, a completely normal 
part of the sport. It’s also a 
source of near constant stress 
for me. I am not a large person 
by any means, but at five-foot-
six, I am the tallest female 
coxswain on the team. I’m 
not going to get into the nitty 
gritty details of my weight in 
this column, but let’s just say 
it’s something I struggle with 
when I’m forced to confront 
my weight on a near weekly 
basis, all while reminiscing 
on my time as a tan, muscular, 
powerful high school athlete. 
Recently, it seems that every 
calorie I eat is accompanied by 
an omnipresent sense of guilt: 
What will I weigh in at if I eat 
this sandwich? If I skip lunch? 
If I go to yoga twice this week, 
can I eat these jelly beans? 
What about water weight? 
How much can I sweat out?
Now, 
is 
this 
a 
healthy 
attitude to take? Probably not. 
But I’m not sure what else to 
do. I love to cook and I love to 
eat, but right now I feel guilty 
for enjoying it. I feel like I have 
to sacrifice because my athletes 
are sacrificing so much for the 
same sport. I don’t talk about 
this with anyone, and have 
never told anyone this whole 
story because I don’t want 
anyone to worry. People think 
I’m chill, laid back and go with 
the flow. I’m the coxswain who 
loves to cook, not obsessed with 
weight at all. I don’t have all 
the answers. I have to admit 
that I don’t know how to have 
a healthy relationship with my 
body, the food I eat and the sport 
I love. I’m so incredibly lucky to 
be surrounded by people who 
love and support me, and make 
sure that I’m treating myself 
with care and respect and want 
me to be healthy, because I 
know others don’t receive this 
same support. I have a long way 
to go before I find that place 
where I’m happy and healthy 
and confident with my weight, 
my body and my place on my 
team, but just by writing this, by 
processing my own emotions on 
the subject, I feel like I’ve taken 
steps in the right direction.

W

e all do it. It’s 
not 
considered 
a 
surprise 
for 
most of us. But despite its 
commonality, 
it 
is still a uniquely 
individual 
experience — and an 
intimidating one at 
that.
What is it, you 
may ask? Growing 
up. It is something 
that I always looked 
forward to in some 
capacity as a child. 
I wanted to be able 
to make my own decisions, 
stay up as late as I wanted 
and be able to watch that 
one show because I could. 
There was this air of glamour 
associated with being an adult 
and considering yourself a 
“grown up,” as depicted in 
the famed “13 Going on 30.” 
Jennifer 
Garner 
wanted 
nothing more than to move 
past 
the 
awkwardness 
of 
adolescence 
and 
suddenly 
live an established lifestyle. 
This concept seemed ideal 
to me in the past, and I 
genuinely believed that the 
progression of growing up 
worked 
somewhat 
in 
this 
way. I convinced myself that 
one would move past all of 
the uncomfortable growing 
pains and find themselves in a 
position in which everything 
had panned out akin to one’s 
vision.
I am now learning that the 
movies are unrealistic.
Moving toward the summer, 
I find myself at a crossroads. 
I am nearly halfway through 
college. As of now, I think I 
know what I want to do, but 
such is seemingly as subject 
to change as the weather 
report on my phone. The 
past two years have been 
transformative, but I also 
feel as though they have gone 
in the blink of an eye. For 
me, time feels as though it is 
moving so quickly that I am 
barely running fast enough to 
catch up to it. Fortunately, I 

know I am not alone.
I am struggling to find a 
balance between focusing on 
my future and taking time to 
live in the moment. 
I find it difficult 
to allow myself to 
de-stress and enjoy 
this 
time 
before 
responsibilities 
increase and more 
is 
expected, 
but 
also focus on what 
is to come. As a 
college student on 
this campus, I feel 
as though there is 
such a fixation on the future. 
This is not a new phenomenon, 
but rather one accelerated 
with the onset of the college 
admissions process. “Taking 
this 
class 
will 
help 
you 
prepare for this test, which 
will 
look 
better 
for 
this 
school,” the story goes. There 
is this persistent expectation 
for students in most schooling 
environments to, at a young 
age, possess a keen awareness 
of the “next” thing. With eyes 
locked on the future, will we 
fail to enjoy the now?

Will I miss out on an 
opportunity because I failed 
to dedicate the extra time to 
it? Or instead chose to pursue 
other interests? Can I find a 
balance between managing 
my own expectations and still 
enjoy living in the moment? 
Am I doing enough or too 
much?
I do not have the answers. 
As summer comes, classes end 
and the next phase begins, 
I challenge myself to be OK 

with not knowing all of the 
answers, but instead knowing 
that the next thing may not 
always be what I anticipate it 
to be.
Recently, someone told me 
that if they could go back in 
time and advise a younger 
self, they would say to not 
plan life out. As someone 
who 
calendars 
everything, 
this idea terrified me. When 
growing up and moving into 
the next phase or stage of 
something always seemed like 
a priority, how could I just not 
plan? Would it be possible?
Now, I am not saying to 
completely abandon an idea or 
plan for what you want and how 
you envision reaching a goal. If 
you find yourself in that place, 
that is amazing. But as I look to 
the final two years of college, 
or 
tackle 
the 
sometimes 
daunting 
task 
of 
applying 
to more job opportunities, 
I am going to advise myself 
to take hold of that notion. 
Sometimes one cannot plan, 
or anticipate, even if they 
believe they are following 
everything according to the 
predetermined steps they have 
laid out.
The secret is that no one 
person truly has everything 
figured out. This is something 
that I have not fully wrapped 
my head around yet, or accepted 
in its entirety, but it is true. No 
one person has all the answers 
for how we can surpass the 
difficulties or ensure that we 
achieve all of the steps we 
predetermine that we need to 
take to reach our foreseen goals 
later on. Despite glamourizing 
the concept at the beginning, 
Jennifer 
Garner’s 
character 
realizes this — that growing 
up is not really as easy as it is 
depicted to be. I am going to 
hold on to that, and remind 
myself sometimes there are 
growing pains, regardless of 
age.

Sally Rooney entered the literary scene in 2015 with “Even if 
You Beat Me,” a nonfiction essay published in the Dublin Review 
recounting her years as a champion debater. A year later, Rooney 
made the jump to fiction with “Mr Salary,” a short story picked 
up by the literary magazine Granta and quickly shortlisted for 
the Sunday Times EFG Short Story Award, the richest prize of its 
kind. In 2017 Rooney released “Conversations with Friends,” her 
first novel chronicling the nuanced adultery that combines and 
recombines a couple and a pair of best friends. Rooney’s debut 
was met with electric praise, awarding her comparisons to both 
Salinger and Joyce and landing her in the VIP zone of the literary 
radar. For a year, we salivated. In Aug. 2018, Rooney released 
her sophomore novel, “Normal People,” in her home country of 
Ireland, where it quickly spread like rapid fire across the globe via 
social media and Amazon.
In the short span of three years, Rooney has evolved from 
essayist to fiction writer to “the first great millennial novelist.” 
Sally Rooney got a New Yorker interview in January, told The 
Guardian that she “do(esn’t) respond to authority very well” and 
has a 10-minute YouTube video on writing and Marxism. She’s a 
veritable cultural event, heralded for her bare prose, biting irony 
and slow burn of love in the time of late capitalism. Just check out 
what happens when you search #normalpeople on Instagram.
“Normal People” drops in the States on Tuesday, Apr. 16, and 
The Michigan Daily Book Review is celebrating by reviewing 
Rooney’s fiction career, last to first. Catch “Normal People” on the 
16th, “Conversations with Friends” on the 17th and “Mr Salary” 
on the 18th.
Frances, the central character of Sally Rooney’s debut novel 
“Conversations With Friends,” is worried she doesn’t have a 
personality. More specifically, she’s worried about how porous 
she is, how willing she is to go along with things that happen 
to her: “At any time I felt I could do or say anything at all, and 
only afterward think: oh, so that’s the kind of person I am.” She 
is always pretending to be interested in something or other, or 
is otherwise carefully evaluating the cultural valences of what 
she says or does. This never results in anything bad or evil, but 
it mostly involves a lot of Frances second-guessing herself in 
microscopic ways. She’s never quite sure if she’s fulfilling the 

role she ends up in correctly, or often, what that role even is. But 
there are roles.
In the place of a fixed personality, Frances experiences a 
series of intense, often contradictory and overlapping emotions 
that she frequently doesn’t find the right words to express. 
Instead, we get complex interpretations of things that happen 
to her and snippets of revelatory action. The prose is always 
even and precise, almost clipped at times; her fraught emotional 
landscape is rendered with what can be merciless objectivity.
Frances also seems to contrast her accommodating personality 

with her best friend and former lover, Bobbi, who is pretty, 
smart and self-assured to the point of being a little mean. It’s 
clear Frances is contrasting her unsteady inner life with Bobbi’s 
glittering exterior, a comparison destined to be maddening. Late 
in the novel, Frances writes a thinly-veiled short story in which 
she describes Bobbi as “a mystery so total I couldn’t endure her, 
a force I couldn’t subjugate with my will, and the love of my 
life.” If the idea of a “personality” seems, itself, a little elusive 
by this point, Frances’s story fully reveals the extent to which 
she tries to replace her desire for love and belonging with the 
dream of individualist autonomy. She wants to be Bobbi, in that 
Bobbi has no legible internal strife, in that Bobbi is worthy of 
love as a result of it.
Rooney, who came of age with the 2008 financial crash and 
austerity politics as a central event in her life, is skillful at 
teasing out the social mythologies of the present moment, where 
everything is in flux and precarity reigns. In one interview, 
she mentions “the particular nature of the crash, which came 

out of our first ever period of prosperity and revealed it to be a 
mirage.”
Her fiction is subtler than simple allegory, though, and she 
treats her thematic material on the scale of a small cast of 
people who, by themselves, can’t be blamed for much. Much 
is made of her Marxism as well as her attachment to an anti-
individualist personal style that is popular with millennials, 
but she really has more in common with Jane Austen or perhaps 
Henry James. She has said herself that it’s sort of difficult to 
represent Marxism, which is societal in scope, in the confines 
of her chosen medium.
She instead considers the framework of a social novel, its 
network of overlapping and contested relationships, as a way to 
show how dependent people are on each other, in a way that can 
be usefully compared with the larger-scale question of society. 
Social class itself, the ways in which our interactions with each 
other are somewhat circumscribed by class tension, certainly 
crops up in Conversations — when Frances first goes to Melissa’s 
house, she quickly notices a framed print, a glass conservatory, 
other expensive objects. “Rich people, I thought. I was always 
thinking about rich people then.” A few chapters later, Frances 
recounts how her father accused her of “changing her accent.”
Class is communicated, ultimately, through small signifiers, 
in the same messy space where everything else about human 
personality is kept. Close to the end of the book, Melissa rips 
into Frances, making almost 300 pages of subtext text. “You 
treated me with total contempt … Suddenly I’m looking around 
my own fucking house, thinking: Is this sofa ugly? Is it kitsch to 
drink wine? And things I felt good about before just started to 
make me feel pathetic.” It’s impossible to know whether Melissa 
is necessarily referring to these things being signifiers of her 
relative class position above Frances, but it’s so obvious that 
such rhetorical questions wouldn’t be possible without their 
disparity.
Rooney’s characters have all the theoretical tools they need 
to understand these things, but they prove useless in the face 
of class divisions, real and fake, and the book is remarkable in 
how combative the characters are even in the best of situations. 
Actually, the novel is remarkably effective at showing how little 
it helps, on a day-to-day basis, to have knowledge. You can read 
feminist theory and thoroughly get to know the present state of 
neoliberal rot, and all of that won’t give you a course of correct 
action in the minutiae of day to day life that we are all subject to.

Socialism and sociality in Rooney’s ‘Conversations’

BOOK REVIEW: SALLY ROONEY WEEK

EMILY YANG
Daily Arts Writer

Known for his hit song 
“Straightjacket,” 
Mikael 
Temrowski, 
better 
known 
as Quinn XCII, has recently 
introduced a new sound to the 
pop sphere. With elements of 
pop, electronic, hip-hop and 
hints of Motown, Temrowski 
has 
certainly 
redefined 
music structure and lyrical 
approach.
Temrowski released his 
new album From Michigan 
With 
Love 
in 
February 
and is in the middle of 
his 
second 
tour. 
While 
Temrowski 
has 
already 
performed in both Grand 
Rapids and his hometown of 
Detroit, Michigan, he plans 
on returning to his home 
state later this month to 
perform at Michigan State 
University. Graduating from 
the university in 2014 with 
a 
degree 
in 
advertising, 
Temrowski 
started 
recording and sharing his 
music to SoundCloud during 
his time in East Lansing 
and 
frequently 
skipped 
classes to drive out to the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
where he collaborated with 
his partner and producer, 
Ayokay.
Initially 
playing 
small 
shows 
in 
East 
Lansing, 
Temrowski 
performed 
under the name Mike T, 
but later opted for Quinn 
XCII. A learned acronym 
from a college professor, 
Quinn 
stands 
for 
“Quit 
Unless Your Instincts Are 
Never 
Neglected,” 
while 
XCII is the Roman Numeral 
for Temrowski’s birth year, 
1992.
While Temrowski almost 
always introduces himself as 
Quinn XCII, he has dropped 
references to his real name 
in his songs, and oftentimes 
his most vulnerable ones. In 
his song “Panama,” a tune 
reflecting over the loss of 
his grandmother, Temrowski 
includes a voicemail message 
from his grandmother at 
the end of the song where 
she addresses him as Mike. 
Temrowski’s real name also 
makes an appearance in his 
song 
“Always 
Been 
You” 
when he describes the way 
his 
girlfriend 
takes 
him 
by surprise by calling him 

Mikael 
amidst 
the 
many 
fans who know him as Quinn 
XCII.
As 
Temrowski’s 
music 
continues to make waves in 
the pop music scene, his real 
name increasingly becomes a 
symbol for the person he was 
before his big break in music. 
The distinct separation he 
makes between his life in the 
spotlight and the one behind 
the scenes suggests he still 
views them as binaries and 
hopes to maintain a personal 
life out of the eyes of the 
public.

MUSIC: PSEUDONYM WEEK
Pseudonym Week: Quinn
XCII and the world of pop

On April 12, the second 
annual 
Michigan 
Fashion 
Media Summit was hosted at 
the Ross School of Business. 
The atmosphere could be 
described 
as 
passionate, 
stylistic 
and 
above 
all 
exciting. 
The 
level 
of 
planning and dedication of 
the team was visible in each 
detail. Be it the aesthetically 
pleasing gift bags, the photo 
booth or even the panels 
highlighting 
the 
features 
of the event, each piece 
complemented 
the 
others 
perfectly.
Ali Gropper, one of the 
founders, said MFMS intends 
to “break the fashion stigma 
in academia.” This daylong 
event offered a rather rare 
opportunity to bridge the 
seemingly large gap between 
the University of Michigan, 
an institution known for 
educational excellence, and 
the complex but commonly 
misunderstood 
world 
of 
fashion 
and 
media. 
The 
morning keynote was hosted 
by Sophia Macks (founder 
of Beyond the Mag) and 
featured 
Jennifer 
Powell 
who is a manager for some 
of 
the 
most 
influential 
social media personalities 
including Chiara Ferragni. 
Listening to Powell speak 
about building one’s brand 
but 
more 
importantly 

prioritizing 
“intention 
and 
potential” 
struck 
a 
chord with me for she truly 
embodies the spirit of taking 
the 
risk 
and 
relentlessly 
following the path you see 
best for yourself. This is 
reflected in the fact that 
Powell was one of the first 
agents to revolutionize the 
space of social media as a 
business.
Out of the three panels 
held, the one that stood out 
to me the most was “The 
Art of Storytelling,” hosted 
by Sophia Chabbott (Digital 
Director at Women Wear 
Daily). 
The 
speaker 
was 
Aliza Licht (former DKNY 
PR head) — the mind behind 
the infamous DKNY PR Girl 
who took Twitter by storm. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this 
panel due its focus on as 
Aliza described building a 
“multi-pronged” 
personal 
narrative, 
something 
that 
is crucial but not always 
touched 
upon 
through 
our 
college 
education. 
Furthermore, 
it 
was 
an 
enthralling time to listen to 
Aliza’s experiences in the 
fashion industry over the 
last 20 years. She is a woman 
who has done it all right from 
working at DKNY to Alice + 
Olivia to writing her own 
book and even launching 
her own company. Thus, it 
is safe to say that Licht’s 
insights were invaluable but 
when she said, “if it doesn’t 
hurt a little, it isn’t change,” 

it 
remained 
with 
me, 
because as students trying to 
navigate their careers, this 
was something that all of us 
could benefit from learning.
I am so grateful to have 
gotten the opportunity to 
attend the Michigan Fashion 
Media Summit because it 
was educational, inspiring 
and of course, fashionable. 
Being 
able 
to 
listen 
to 
professionals from a varied 
range of areas of such a 
diverse 
industry 
enabled 
one to go so much deeper in 
comprehending the world of 
fashion. Moreover, the event 
also offered the opportunity 
to 
advance 
professionally 
through 
its 
networking 
sessions while highlighting 
the 
fashion 
space 
at 
the 
University 
with 
the 
Fashion Forward Showcase 
(presented 
by 
Steve 
Madden) 
that 
recognized 
the work of students in the 
industry. MFMS highlighted 
the possibilities that lie in 
lesser explored fields while 
gradually transforming the 
relationship 
between 
the 
University and the world 
of fashion. I believe that 
anyone with even a brief 
interest in related industries 
or even those simply in 
need for motivation should 
definitely attend the MFMS 
next 
year 
to 
gain 
novel 
perspectives from those who 
have not only excelled but 
have rather re-defined what 
they do.

Fashion Media Summit is 
an opportunity to explore

I’ve always been Becky. I 
think it’s because my parents 
felt weird calling an infant 
such a large and syllable-filled 
name like Rebecca. First I 
was Baby Becky then Becky 
Boo then Miss Becky then just 
Becky. I liked being Becky, 
mostly because it wasn’t basic 
like Rachel or Sarah or Leah. 
Becky was also temporary, a 
name that I would outgrow like 
my Velcro light-up sketchers or 
my cheetah print Limited Too 
camisole.
I thought one day, I would 
wake up and know today 
was the day I would become 
Rebecca. I would develop a 
slight affectation and go to an 
Ivy League school and marry a 
man named James or Henry or 
William. When college rolled 
around, I tried Rebecca on for a 
while. I let her come with me to 
parties and dates and even The 
Daily’s mass meeting. My first 
article was published under the 
name “Rebecca,” but I could 
never fully take ownership of 
it because it didn’t feel like me. 
I wasn’t Rebecca, I was Becky.
But Becky has not been 
an easy name to bear. Every 
Starbucks order, every job 
application, 
they 
wonder. 
Becky, really? Yeah, the name’s 
Becky, what’s it to you, Denise? 
From Sir Mix-a-Lot’s butt-
gazing Becky to Beyoncé’s 
“Becky with the good hair” to 
the criminal behavior of our 
once beloved Aunt Becky, my 
name has become one heavy 
with 
cultural 
significance. 
When I was in middle school, 
the hottest thing to do was look 
words up on Urban Dictionary. 
People 
would 
look 
up 
everything from “hairbrush” 
to “flogging” and giggle to their 

dirty little prepubescent selves. 
One day, a boy in my class 
thought it would be “funny” to 
look up every single name in 
our class (easy coming from a 
dude named David). When he 

looked up my name he found 
that Becky is synonymous with 
oral sex or “a stereotypical, 
basic 
white 
girl; 
obsessed 
with Starbucks, Ugg boots and 
trying to have a bigger butt.” I 
think that was the first time I 
felt insecure about my name, 
anxious and eager for the time 
I would become Rebecca. For 
a few weeks, my name would 
provoke explicit gestures and 
catcalls, but like anything in 
middle school it went out of 
vogue almost as quickly as it 
entered it.
A few weeks ago, The Wall 
Street Journal Opinion section 
published an article with the 
title 
“Notable 
& 
Quotable: 
Beckys.” My mother sent me a 
picture of it because, obviously, 
she 
gets 
the 
Wall 
Street 
Journal (and what college 
student actually subscribes to 
the Wall Street Journal). The 
blurb highlighted a symposium 
at the American Education 
Research 
Association’s 
annual conference in Toronto. 
The 
symposium 
addressed 

fanfiction 
about 
“Beckys.” 
The panel on said “Beckys” 
was 
titled 
“Critical 
Becky 
Studies: Critical Exploration 
of 
Gender, 
Race 
and 
the 
Pedagogies of Whiteness” and 
included a variety of essays and 
discussions on the topic.
One paper titled “Becky 
Book 
Club: 
White 
Racial 
Bonding in the Living Room” 
considers book clubs in white, 
suburban living rooms and the 
underlying white supremacy 
and 
surveillance 
that 
lurk 
beneath the charcuterie board 
and 
chardonnay. 
Another 
paper titled “Border Becky: 
Exploring 
White 
Women’s 
Emotionality, 
Ignorance, 
Investment 
in 
Whiteness” 
explores white women who 
may be found on the edge, on 
the border of choosing to be a 
“race traitor” or “repledging 
their 
allegiance 
to 
white 
supremacy.”
OK, so I thought Critical 
Becky Studies would be more 
about uncovering the true 
identity of Jay-Z’s accomplice 
in 
his 
extramarital 
affair 
(Rachel 
Roy? 
Rita 
Ora? 
Me?) and less about white 
supremacy. Nevertheless, it’s 
interesting to see how far the 
concept of Becky has come. The 
Becky has surpassed tabloids 
and song lyrics and has now 
officially entered the point of 
no return: academia.
Say what you will about 
the 
stereotypical 
Becky; 
the 
bleach-blonde-haired 
Becky, the Juicy sweatsuit-
wearing Becky, the Pinot in a 
Swell bottle Becky. But I am 
reclaiming Becky. I am my 
own Becky and my Becky is not 
those Beckys, she is her own 
goddamn Becky goddamnit.

Call me by my name: On
learning to love ‘Becky’

One 
of 
the 
most 
unforgettable 
scenes 
from 
“The 
Breakfast 
Club” 
is 
when each student reveals 
their juiciest secrets. Now, 
take that same scene and 
imagine it without all of the 
context that precedes it: no 
impromptu dance sequence, 
no racy banter between Claire 
and Bender and 
no recollection 
of 
the 
nerd, 
jock, 
burnout 
and 
princess 
archetypes that 
each 
character 
embodies. 
Without 
these 
previous scenes, 
which 
are 
fundamental 
in 
establishing 
the characters’ 
personalities 
and backstories, 
we would have 
zero 
reason 
to 
invest 
in 
any 
of 
the 
protagonists, 
and 
this 
infamous 
classic would be just another 
mediocre 
’80s 
teen 
flick. 
“Who Would You Take to 
a Deserted Island” is this 
hypothetical Breakfast Club 
failure. 
Unable 
to 
create 
multidimensional characters, 
and 
providing 
a 
minimal 
frame of reference for the 
characters’ 
relationships, 
the film is nothing short of 
lifeless, earning itself the 
label of just another low-
quality drama.
On a hot, summer day 
in Madrid, tensions fizzle 
between twenty-somethings 
housemates Celeste (Andrea 
Ros 
“[Rec] 
2”), 
Eze 
(Pol 
Monen 
“Loving”), 
Marcos 
(Jaime 
Lorente 
“Money 

Heist”) and Marco’s live-
in girlfriend Marta (María 
Pedraza “Money Heist”), as 
they each prepare to enter 
new life chapters and go their 
separate ways. Determined 
to celebrate their friendship 
with one last hurrah, the 
gang hits the town for a wild 
night saturated with alcohol 
and drugs. Though intending 
to dance the night away, 
their spirited evening quickly 
turns sour upon returning 

to their apartment for a 
nightcap. As the drinks flow 
freely, the roomies strike up 
a seemingly innocent game of 
what-ifs, but soon suppressed 
secrets bubble to the surface, 
tears are spilled and the very 
fabric of the foursome’s bond 
threatens to tear.
Central 
to 
the 
film’s 
flimsiness is its practically 
non-existent plotline. It is 
almost insulting to viewers to 
suppose that we would latch 
onto a drama crafted under 
circumstances as stupid and 
immature as a party game. 
Yes, the game was just the 
spark that blew up the layers 
of resentments and hostilities 
beneath, but the fact that the 

bonds shared between these 
longtime friends were able 
to topple faster than a house 
of playing cards seems quite 
unrealistic and excessively 
melodramatic. 
Despite assumed attempts 
to wow audiences with high 
drama and attractive actors, 
the hard truth is that this 
film is literally about nothing. 
The majority of its scenes 
feel pointless and without 
direction because, with such a 
barebones plot, 
there truly is 
nowhere to go 
but in circles. 
The 
film 
is 
a 
dangerous 
combination of 
puddle-deep 
characters 
mixed 
with 
reality 
TV 
level 
drama. 
The year-long 
resentments 
and 
heated 
love-triangles 
that are thrown 
our way seem 
to 
come 
out 
of 
nowhere, 
making 
the 
theatrically-
staged 
argument 
scenes 
appear 
more dull and confusing than 
profound. Further, without 
exploring 
the 
intersection 
and history of the characters’ 
stories, the film makes the 
costly mistake of expecting 
us to put together the pieces 
ourselves. This leads us to 
disconnect entirely.
Harsh or not, there is 
honestly not much that can be 
said on behalf of “Who Would 
You Take on a Deserted 
Island.” 
Lacking 
rhythm, 
direction or tang, though only 
a mere hour and a half long, 
the film feels unbearably 
slow, ultimately coming off 
as a tedious and valueless 
muddle.

FILM REVIEW
‘Deserted Island’ was a
terrible film experience

Who Would You Take to a Deserted 
Island

Netflix

Canica Films

The 
legend 
of 
Orpheus 
recounts the tale of a musician 
— the best musician of all time, 
according to legend. Son of 
the muse Calliope and taught 
how to play the lyre by Apollo 
himself, it is said his music had 
the ability to charm animals 
and make trees dance. I didn’t 
see 
any 
hypnotized 
Diag 
squirrels or dancing oaks, but 
the Orpheus Singers certainly 
lived up to their name. Directed 
by Eugene Rogers, the smallest 
of the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance choirs put on a night of 
beautiful classical choir pieces 
that charmed their audience.
Admittedly, 
the 
concert 
was off to a rocky start with 
“Christ lag in Todesbanden, 
BWV 4” by Johann Sebastian 
Bach. Though the sections 
had perfect blend, flawless 
harmonies and angelic tone, 
the 
performance 
lacked 
enthusiasm. With few vocal 
dynamics 
and 
no 
facial 

expression, the first section 
of the concert was relatively 
unengaging. 
There 
seemed 
to be no passion for these 
hauntingly beautiful pieces. 
Though 
singing 
pieces 
in 
different 
languages 
are 
typically less engaging, the 
best performances can convey 
meaning even through the 
language barrier.
However, 
the 
enthusiasm 
increased 
as 
the 
concert 
progressed. The remaining two 
pieces, “Fern Hill” and “Five 
Mystical Songs” were much 
livelier. Halfway through the 
concert, it seemed as though a 
switch had been flipped, and lo 
and behold! Dynamics! There 
were so many shifts in the 
music, designated by the sharp 
crescendos and decrescendos, 
skillfully 
and 
beautifully 
executed.
The 
many 
soloists 
throughout 
the 
evening 
particularly embodied those 
strong 
connections, 
really 
bringing the pieces to life. All 
of the singers had beautiful 
voices, but SMTD Master’s 

student Meridian Prall was 
particularly impressive. She 
didn’t just sing with exquisite 
tone and impressive vibrato — 
she performed. By the end of 
her solo, I had chills.
Another stand out soloist 
was University alumni Sam 
Kidd, 
who 
was 
featured 
strongly 
in 
“Five 
Mystical 
Songs” to end the concert. His 
powerful voice rang through 
the 
auditorium 
and 
could 
even rival the choir when they 
joined him. Some of the best 
parts of the entire concert were 
when the orchestra dropped 
out and the choir harmonized 
with hums in the background 
as Kidd continued his solo. 
Those few moments seemed 
almost magical.
While the concert at times 
wasn’t quite as engaging as it 
could have been, the Orpheus 
Singers made up for it with 
their incredible sound. Very 
rarely have I heard such a pure 
tone and the perfect blend 
between sections. If Orpheus 
is the best musician of all time, 
this choir is aptly named.

The Orpheus Singers live

Big game woes
T

he Michigan baseball 
team is 24-11 overall 
and stands third in the 
Big Ten. The 
Wolverines 
have scored 
100 more 
runs than 
their oppo-
nents, only 
one regular 
starter has an 
on-base per-
centage less 
than .300 and 
the team has 
38 total home runs.
They’ve won five games by 
double digits, 
16 by four or 
more runs and 
have a defense 
that shuts down 
opposing hitters. 
That is, if they’re 
playing lesser 
teams. Teams 
like Michigan 
State, Bing-
hamton or West 
Michigan.
The Wolverines have a .800 
winning percentage against 
opponents with a losing record 
and have committed just 15 
errors in the 20 games, coolly 
putting teams away.
Michigan has rock solid lead-
ership and a great communal 
effort, obvious even from a press 
box a hundred feet away.
“This is some of the best 
leadership and team chemistry 
that I’ve seen in the program 
in the six and a half years I’ve 
been here,” Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich said at the beginning of 
the year.
Added senior infielder Blake 
Nelson after a home opener 
win: “It starts with our team. 
We’re all bought in for the win. 
Whether that’s warming up with 
the outfielders, doing the chart 
or playing in the game. It doesn’t 
really matter, we all know our 
roles and we’re all ready to come 
in when our number is called.”
But then they play good 
teams. They still have a winning 
record against those at or above 
.500, winning eight of 14, mostly 

thanks to a 5-0 record against 
teams with a dead even record.
Their impressively clean 
defense, though, falls apart — 
doubling its rate of errors from 
.75 errors per game to 1.5.
Michigan’s 100-run advantage 
over its opponents? It shrinks all 
the way to one. 
“We were shaky at times 
defensively,” Bakich said after 
a deflating weekend against the 
Buckeyes. “We didn’t get the 
clutch hits when we needed to 
and a rivalry series is very emo-
tional. It has all the characteris-
tics, the look and feel, of big-time 
baseball whether your opponent 
is ranked or not.”
Big time 
baseball hasn’t 
been kind to 
the Wolverines. 
Like they did in 
Columbus when 
they went 1-2, 
Michigan folded 
in Los Angeles 
and Lubbock. It 
was unable to 
compete with 
the spotlight on them.
Bakich, though, has always 
been big on growth.
“What I’d like us to do better 
is continue to trend upwards 
when we have setbacks like 
this, to use it as growth and fuel 
to better our performance in 

the future,” Bakich said after 
Ohio State. “If we’re going to 
be the team that I think we’re 
going to be, then we’re going to 
have to play well when it means 
the most and a rivalry series is 
one of those weekends when it 
means the most.”
When will that growth come? 
The losses to Ohio State came 
a month after losing four out of 
five in California and two weeks 
after being swept by Texas 
Tech. At what point, if ever, 
will the Wolverines’ experience 
settle their nerves in big series’?
In time, we’ll learn. Four 
of Michigan’s final five series 
are against teams with a .500 
record or better, with its final 
two series against the teams 
ahead of the Wolverines in the 
Big Ten standings.
As they enter the final month 
of the regular season, Michi-
gan needs to limit its mistakes 
in the face of tough competi-
tion — its pitchers can’t miss, 
its defenders can’t make costly 
mistakes and its offense needs 
to be consistent. That is, if they 
want to reach their lofty aspira-
tions in the playoffs.

Michigan coach Erik Bakich noted that his team needs to step up its game.

Alex StoraKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKo

Freshman right-hander fans 15 in career day, leading Michigan past Michigan State in East Lansing, 12-1

EAST LANSING — Looking to 
avenge last year’s first round loss 
in the Big Ten tournament, the 
Michigan softball team traveled to 
East Lansing and was greeted by an 
even mix of green and white as well 
as maize and blue. The Wolverines 
ensured they dazzled the strong 
visiting crowd, nearly securing a 
run-rule victory and winning 12-1.
Early on, though, it seemed tough 
to predict such an outcome.
After 
a 
lackluster 
offensive 
showing in the top of the first by 
Michigan, sophomore left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien stepped into 
the circle looking to rebound from 
Saturday’s extra-inning loss against 
Ohio State.
But Beaubien did the exact 
opposite — she gave up three hits 
and a walk to her first four batters. 
And that was plenty enough for 
Wolverines’ coach Carol Hutchins 
to visit the pitcher. Rather than 
having a few words with Beaubien 
and leaving her in, Hutchins pulled 
the trigger and substituted Beaubien 
out for freshman right-hander Alex 
Storako. Storako, even when facing 
a bases-loaded situation, wasn’t 
fazed and dished out two strikeouts 
and a scoreless inning. 
“Just like we’ve been focusing on 
all year, just the one-pitch focus, I 
think that really got me through (the 
jam),” Storako said. “Just clearing 
my head and having no thoughts 
during (it).” 
That was about the only difficulty 
Michigan faced the entire evening.
Trailing 1-0, the Wolverines 
began to string together hit after 
hit, starting with the bottom of the 
lineup — exactly what Hutchins 
asked for after the Indiana series. 
Starting with junior third baseman 
Madison Uden, who hit a double 
to the centerfield wall, Michigan 
found its first runs on a two-run 
home run from senior catcher Katie 
Alexander, giving the Wolverines a 
2-1 lead. 
Sophomore shortstop Natalia 

Rodriguez 
continued 
her 
consistency from the ninth spot in 
the batting order, finding herself in 
scoring position after a single and a 
stolen base — her eighth of the year 
— and coming home on a RBI double 
from dependable senior second 
baseman Faith Canfield.
But that was only the start of the 
Wolverines’ onslaught.
After a RBI single in third inning 
from senior first baseman Alex 
Sobczak, Michigan exploded in the 
top of the fourth inning.
With 
each 
playing 
in 
the 
lineup seeing an at-bat during this 
inning, the wheels came off for the 
Spartans. 
First, Canfield added another 
RBI, this time on a triple. The 
outfield pairing of senior Natalie 
Peters and freshman Lexie Blair 
combined for the next run as Peters, 
who preceded Blair’s at-bat with a 
single and a stolen base, came home 
on a double from Blair down the left 
field line. 
A couple batters later, the 
Wolverines found their next run 
through a rather unconventional 
method. Michigan State pitcher 
McKenna Gregory, who had just 
come into the game, walked Uden 
home from third and Michigan 
found itself leading 7-1. Junior Haley 

Hoogenraad also got in on the party, 
driving in another run off a Spartan 
error at first base.
In the meantime, Storako was 
having herself a career night. 
Continuing her dominance from 
the first inning, Storako pitched six 
no-hit innings along with a career-
high 15 strikeouts. 
“I didn’t know (I had a career-
high) until just now,” Storako said 
when asked about her performance. 
“Just not focusing on the results and 
focusing on the process has really 
helped not only me but the entire 
team.”
After a couple quiet innings of 
being one run away from winning 
on a rule-run, Michigan made sure 
it left Secchia Stadium with a bang 
— literally.
Alexander drove a high-flying 
home run to center, extending the 
Wolverines lead to eight in the top 
of the seventh. And with a surefire 
victory in the bag, the freshman 
pinch hitters kept the intensity 
going. 
With Hannah Carson on first 
base after a full-count walk, Morgan 
Overaitis made sure they both were 
accounted for on the scoreboard as 
she unleashed a long ball to center 
field, capping off the ideal bounce-
back performance for Michigan.

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
Alex 
Storako finally demonstrated the 
endurance that Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins has been looking 
for all season. 
The 
freshman 
right-hander 
proved herself in Tuesday’s game 
against 
Michigan 
State 
when 
sophomore left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien struggled right off the 
bat. Beaubien, typically the team’s 
reliable ace, allowed three singles 
followed by a walk to force a runner 
home in the first inning, putting the 
Wolverines at a one run early. 
Storako — substituted in with 
no outs and the bases still loaded — 
took the opportunity in stride.
She ended the inning with a 
flyout followed by two strikeouts, 
rescuing Michigan from the jam 
without sacrificing another run.
“Her team needed her to step 
up and she did a fantastic job,” 
Hutchins said. “She has that in her 
and she hasn’t always shown it. 
Tonight we needed it from her, and 
she stepped it up and did what we 
think she’s capable of — shutting 
down an opponent.”
She registered a career high of 
15 strikeouts and went six innings 
before Michigan State registered a 

hit against her.
She began to shake in the second 
inning. While she struck out the 
first batter she faced, Storako 
walked the next. She repeated this 
pattern with another strikeout and 
walk, putting two Spartans on base. 
With these two walks, it looked 
like Storako might be suffering 
from a challenge that’s plagued 
her all season: late-game struggles. 
Facing tough competition and 
close games, recently Hutchins has 
opted to pull Storako at the first 
sign of trouble. 
In 
the 
contest 
against 
Indiana 
earlier 
in 
the 
month, 
Storako 
was switched for 
Beaubien 
after 
hitting a batter 
with a pitch. 
But 
not 
Tuesday. 
Storako 
remained 
composed, 
throwing a ball followed by three 
pitches straight into the strike zone. 
With a flyout, the inning ended 
scoreless. 
These struggles were entirely 
absent in the following inning 
when Storako retired three batters 
with consecutive strikeouts, ending 
the third almost as soon as it had 
begun. 
Storako’s performance began to 
waver again in the fourth, starting 
the inning with a leadoff walk. 
Clawing her way back from behind 
in the count, Storako struck out 
the next two batters, though the 
leadoff runner advanced on a wild 
pitch. Another walk put runners on 
first and second, but Storako wasn’t 
fazed. She struck out the next 
batter to end the inning, once again 
leaving Michigan State without a 
run. 
She regained her rhythm in the 
fifth inning. After the first batter 
flied out, she struck out the next 
two. 
Storako’s 
performance 
only 

improved as the innings went on. In 
the final two innings, she registered 
four more strikeouts and allowed 
just two batters to reach base. 
“She came in and got out of 
that hairy first inning, then she 
had some ups and downs — a few 
walks in the middle there — but 
she was able to bring herself back,” 
Hutchins said. 
This game is the first in over 
a month in which Storako has 
pitched seven full innings. Despite 
not usually pitching into the fourth 
and fifth innings, 
Storako didn’t feel 
physical or mental 
fatigue. 
“It’s 
been 
a 
while since going 
a long game like 
that,” 
Storako 
said. 
“I 
think 
my 
workouts 
have been a lot of 
conditioning. I’m 
not really focused 
on results, just the 
process.”
This contest marked several 
other firsts in Storako’s career, 
including the first time she has 
pitched six innings without a hit 
and seven innings with just one hit.
Storako’s stamina would be a 
huge asset to the Wolverines if it 
were to continue into the rest of the 
season. With 147 innings already 
piled on Beaubien’s left arm, 
having Storako as a reliable second 
pitcher may be the difference 
between success and failure in the 
postseason. 
Hutchins made it clear that 
Storako 
would 
have 
further 
opportunities 
to 
show 
this 
persistence 
after 
Tuesday’s 
performance. 
“That is good for us to see,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“She 
worked 
through it and in the future we’ll 
have more confidence to allow her 
to work through it.”
Michigan went on to win, 12-1. 
They have Storako’s newfound 
endurance to thank.

Hutchins’ history lesson: At 
MSU, a reminder of progress 

EAST LANSING — Each 
year, the Michigan softball 
team plays a road game at 
Michigan State. And each year, 
coach Carol Hutchins seizes 
the opportunity to give her 
team a history lesson.
At 
Secchia 
Stadium, 
the 
right field fence is draped in 
a green 1976 AIAW National 
Champions banner. The crown, 
which came four years after 
Congress passed Title IX of 
the Education Amendments, 
is the Spartans’ lone national 
championship.
On a team that featured 
talent from top to bottom, 
senior pitcher Gloria Becksford 
stood out. Becksford’s three 
consecutive shutouts and 25 
strikeouts propelled Michigan 
State to the 1976 AIAW Softball 
College 
World 
Series 
title 
that is commemorated on the 
Spartans’ fence to this day.
That 
season, 
Becksford 
took a certain Michigan State 
freshman 
under 
her 
wing. 
Today, that freshman is the 
NCAA’s winningest coach of 
all-time.
On Tuesday night, Hutchins 
made her 35th homecoming 
as 
the 
Wolverines’ 
coach. 
She tallied her 1,601st career 
coaching victory — the most in 
the history of the sport. No. 21 
Michigan (30-11 overall, 12-1 
Big Ten) throttled the Spartans 
(15-25, 3-9), 12-1, behind senior 
catcher 
Katie 
Alexander’s 
two home runs and freshman 
right-hander Alex Storako’s 15 
strikeouts.
After taking care of business, 
the Wolverines boarded their 
bus 
with 
something 
more 
valuable than just a win. The 
experience of competing on the 
same field that Hutchins played 
on — and often maintained 
herself amid an underfunded 
era of women’s athletics— gives 
Michigan an annual reminder.
“She talks a lot about where 
sports were during her time (at 

Michigan State) and she teaches 
us how far we’ve come,” said 
senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield. “She lets us know we 
need to be thankful for where 
we are now because when she 
was here, it was not like that. 
… She’s one of the core people 
who have given us the platform 
for where we are now. It’s 
unbelievable and I’m thankful 
for it.”
To Hutchins, it’s just one 
component of a meaningful 
college 
experience. 
The 
philosophy 
plays 
an 
instrumental 
role 
in 
the 
legend’s approach to coaching.
“I 
had 
a 
great 
college 
experience,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“It’s one of the reason I stayed 
in college athletics. When I 
got college and then started 
coaching, my mom said, ‘You 
know, you’ve never left college.’ 
And I said, ‘Why would anybody 
ever leave college?’ ”
Today, 
Hutchins 
strives 
to offer her student-athletes 
a 
well-rounded 
college 
experience. 
Her 
program 
goes far beyond the diamond. 
Words 
like 
“relationships” 
and “education” come up in 
conversation before wins and 
losses are even mentioned.
Her definition of greatness 
— as with everything she does 
— comes with its own unique 
flair.

“I want my kids to experience 
what it is to be great,” Hutchins 
said. “We achieved greatness at 
Michigan State when I played, 
and greatness isn’t just defined 
by a national championship. 
Greatness is (defined by) great 
friends, great teammates and 
great work, and it’s a life lesson 
to be a college athlete.”
After 
three 
and 
a 
half 
decades of greatness in Ann 
Arbor, 
Canfield 
sometimes 
struggles to associate Hutchins 
with her alma mater’s colors.
“It’s weird to see (the banner 
in East Lansing), just seeing 
how 
passionate 
(Hutchins) 
is about Michigan,” Canfield 
said. “It’s actually really weird 
seeing it in green. She’s one of 
the greatest to ever do it. All 
of us have played for her, it’s 
interesting to remember that 
she actually played too.”
Forty-three 
years 
after 
taking 
home 
the 
national 
championship, Hutchins uses 
the banner as a benchmark. 
But not a benchmark of time, 
success or experience. Instead, 
she smiles every time Michigan 
launches a home run over the 
wall it covers — the same one 
she helped build.
Asked 
about 
the 
banner 
and its legacy after the game, 
Storako flashed a smile.
“She told the hitters to hit 
the ball there.”

Michigan football freshmen experiencing benefits of early enrollment

There’s a phrase ringing 
around 
Schembechler 
Hall: 
Michigan’s 
early 
enrollees 
“should be at high school prom.” 
Cornerbacks 
coach 
Mike 
Zordich 
described 
them as “raw” 
and 
“green.” 
Certainly, 
they’re 
not 
ready for college 
football, not yet.
This is what 
spring 
ball 
is 
for those who 
graduate high school a semester 
early to come to Ann Arbor.
There 
are 
exceptions, 
of 
course. 
Mike 
Sainristil, 
a 
three-star 
athlete-turned-
receiver in the 2019 class, 
has stolen the headlines and 
threatened junior cornerback 
Ambry Thomas’ mantle as the 
fastest player on the team. But 
Sainristil stands out as the 
exception, the extreme version 
of 
more 
moderate 
success 
stories like defensive lineman 
Mazi Smith and tight end Erick 
All.
For most, the adjustment 
isn’t so glamorous. The beauty 
of spring ball is that it doesn’t 
have to be.
Take four-star cornerback 
Jalen Perry, one of the eight 
early 
enrollees 
not 
in 
the 
spotlight. Despite his four-star 
billing, Perry isn’t expected to 
play much this season. When 
you ask Zordich about him, his 
response says as much without 
saying as much.
“Jalen?” 
Zordich 
asked, 
outwardly 
surprised 
that 
Tuesday’s press conference had 
made it that far down the depth 
chart. “(He’s) young. And I keep 
telling myself, hitting myself on 
the head cause I don’t want — 

he should be at the prom and 
he’s here with us now. And he’s 
gifted, he’s got the skillset, but 
he’s still in high school. And he’s 
got a little ways to go catching 
up, understanding the speed of 
the game, the technique that we 
use.”
Zordich, 
though, doesn’t 
mind the slow 
learning 
curve 
— 
the 
focus 
of 
spring 
ball 
for 
incoming 
freshmen 
is 
rarely 
on 
the 
upcoming fall.
“He’s getting 
all this under his 
belt now so he’ll walk in in the 
fall,” Zordich said. “He won’t 

have to go to the bridge process 
school and hopefully with his 
mind — he’s a very bright kid — 
he’ll retain all this and just be 
able to retain all this and just 
have that under his belt and feel 
a little more comfortable than 
he did walking 
in 
here 
raw, 
green as hell.”
Slow 
learning curves 
and 
“feeling 
a 
little 
more 
comfortable” 
are the point 
of 
spring 
practices. 
Even Sainristil 
figures to be 
behind 
Donovan 
Peoples-
Jones, Nico Collins and Tarik 

Black, and possibly Ronnie Bell 
and Oliver Martin, on the depth 
chart. All will likely slot in 
behind Sean McKeon and Nick 
Eubanks.
But spring ball is about the 
future. It’s about the next 
generation 
of 
Donovan 
Jeters 
— 
the 
redshirt 
sophomore 
who 
arrived 
at 
Michigan 
in 
January 2017 and 
played sparingly 
during his first 
two 
years. 
His 
first 
spring 
accelerated 
him 
to 
becoming 
a 
key member of the Wolverines’ 
defensive line next fall.

There’s 
a 
reason 
Jeter 
glows with excitement when 
talking about this year’s class, 
especially Smith.
“I tell (Smith) all the time, 
I was you, I was in your exact 
same 
position,” 
Jeter 
said. 
“So with him, 
it’s just gonna 
become 
how 
fast he can pick 
up the speed of 
the game cause 
(Smith), 
dude’s 
like a monster.”
Vincent 
Gray is among 
those 
on 
the 
opposite 
side. 
The sophomore 
cornerback 
committed 
to 
Michigan late in the 2017 

recruiting 
cycle 
and 
didn’t 
have the chance to enroll early. 
Instead, he spent his freshman 
year learning the playbook and 
played in just two games.
A year later, Gray — now 
expected to be among the 
Wolverines’ 
top 
trio 
of 
defensive backs 
— has become 
a 
mentor 
for 
Perry, 
guiding 
him through the 
spring he never 
had.
“With 
Jalen 
Perry, 
yeah, 
we’ve 
been 
working 
on 
the playbook a lot,” Gray said. 
“He’s really got it down, more 
advanced than I thought he 
would at this point is what I’d 
say, so he’s been making big 
strides. … That’s like the biggest 
part of what we do, being able to 
gain the trust from the coaches 
that you know what you’re 
doing when you get out there.”
The sacrifices of enrolling 
early aren’t small. Those little 
tidbits intermingled in football 
talk — the high school prom 
mentioned 
in 
passing, 
the 
allure of graduating with your 
classmates — matter to athletes. 
Parents want their kids at home 
for one last semester.
“Being 
a 
father 
of 
two 
Division I players,” Zordich 
said, “a father and mother don’t 
want them to go. But as a coach, 
it’s a beautiful thing.”
It’s 
a 
conversation 
that 
Michigan’s coaching staff has 
with any player considering 
enrolling early. And despite the 
benefits of getting to campus 
six months before everyone 
else, it’s a conversation that 
usually ends in fall enrollment.
But when it doesn’t, the 
Wolverines reap the benefits. 
Even if they take a while to 
come to fruition.

Thomas maturing into leader

Ambry Thomas didn’t mince 
words.
When asked about his speed 
last 
Thursday, 
the 
junior 
defensive back had a simple 
response: “I’m the fastest guy 
on the team. Not many guys 
faster than me in the NCAA. Just 
keeping it real.”
A reporter asked a follow-
up 
about 
Thomas’ 
40-yard 
dash. He then launched into an 
explanation about how his time 
was “pretty fast,” but his real 
pride lies in his in-game, not 
straight-line, speed.
“People can run fast,” Thomas 
said. “But can you play fast? I 
play fast.”
Ironically, Thomas’ ability to 
play fast once held him back from 
becoming a main contributor 
on the Michigan football team. 
Defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown’s 
press 
man 
scheme 
requires technique and patience 
from its defensive backs. Those 
are two things that can become 
lost if you rely solely on your 
speed — as was the case for 
Thomas.
Last 
year 
against 
Ohio 
State, the game slipped away 
as the secondary struggled to 
keep up with the Buckeyes’ 
speedy 
receivers. 
Thomas, 
unquestionably a quicker corner, 
still didn’t come into the game — 
a testament to the flaws he still 
needed to iron out.
But 
now, 
teammates 
and 
coaches say Thomas has stepped 
up his game and come on as a 
player who could be a major 
contributor on a secondary that 
has a lost several key contributors 
— including cornerbacks David 
Long and Brandon Watson.
“The sky is the limit for that 
guy,” said cornerbacks coach 
Michael Zordich on Tuesday. 
“He’s really had a great spring. 
… His technique and his patience 
with the line of scrimmage and 
the fact that he knows that he 
has the opportunity to start. He’s 
really embraced that role and he 
is becoming a leader.”
Thomas knew at the end of last 
season that his role was going to 

increase no matter what — even 
if Long or senior defensive back 
Lavert Hill both stayed. In that, 
Thomas wanted to take the new 
guys under his wing, just as the 
veterans had done for him when 
he was a freshman.
It’s a role Thomas has wanted 
to have from the beginning, but 
now 
it’s 
also 
one he finally 
has the on-field 
clout — and the 
maturity — to 
truly assume.
“I’ve matured 
a 
lot 
on 
the 
field,” 
Thomas 
said. “I usually, 
everybody 
knows I bring 
that 
energy 
to the field but … I really just 
wanna focus in on myself and 
the young players, trying to bring 
them along, because we want 
everybody to be a part of the 
team this season.”
Compared to a senior like Hill, 
the smaller age gap between 
Thomas and the freshmen allows 
him to connect with them. 
Redshirt 
freshman 
defensive 
back Vincent Gray, preparing 
for his first year as an on-field 
contributor, 
credits 
Thomas 
with showing him the ropes and 

helping him learn the playbook.
According 
to 
Zordich, 
it 
was the end of last season 
when Thomas really started 
to improve. He knew there 
would be a spot for him and he 
was hungry. So Thomas seized 
the opportunity and began to 
understand his body and his 
limitations 
— 
an 
important 
development 
for a player who 
will so brazenly 
proclaim 
his 
quickness.
Thomas 
can, 
in 
turn, 
help 
younger players 
make the same 
leap he did. Lots 
of guys come in 
with the same kind of confidence 
Thomas has, without knowing 
the boundaries of their abilities. 
Now that Thomas understands 
that, it will not only help him, but 
the rest of the secondary as well.
“Everybody was talking about 
this mind change and slow your 
mind down,” Thomas said. “I 
really see it now, and that’s one 
thing I’ve noticed, if anything. 
I believe my playmaking ability 
has always been there but it’s just 
the mind, the whole mindset that 
changed a lot.”

Seniors appreciated in Sunday win

In their last home matches 
at the Varsity Tennis Center on 
Sunday, seniors Gabe Tishman 
and Myles Schalet made sure 
to leave their mark for the 
Wolverines.
The Michigan men’s tennis 
team (15-6 overall, 6-3 Big 
Ten) defeated Wisconsin (9-9, 
3-5), 5-2, with both Tishman 
and Schalet winning their 
respective 
matches. 
The 
seniors also both won their 
doubles matches, in which 
Tishman 
paired 
up 
with 
sophomore Harrison Brown 
and Schalet with freshman 
Andrew Fenty.
After 
the 
doubles 
matches, 
Tishman 
and 
Schalet 
participated 
in 
a 
short 
ceremony 
celebrating 
their four years playing for 
Michigan. Their career stats 
were announced and their 
parents walked with them 
across the court.
“It’s been an unreal four 
years,” Schalet said. “It flew 
by so quickly. The school has 
given me so many different 
experiences, and it has been 

the best four years of my life 
for sure. I have no regrets.”
After the ceremony, the 
match transitioned to singles 
play. Tishman played at sixth 
singles and Schalet at third. 
Schalet cruised to a 6-1, 6-1 
victory. On match point, after 
a crosscourt rally, he hit a 
down-the-
line 
forehand 
winner 
that 
just 
barely 
clipped the net. 
Immediately, 
Michigan 
coach 
Adam 
Steinberg came 
out and hugged 
his senior after 
he earned his 
final 
regular 
season singles win, 63rd for 
his career.
“The coaches have taken my 
teammates and I great places 
on and off the court, and I’m 
gonna miss these guys more 
than anything,” Schalet said. 
“We’re not done, since we have 
a lot of work to do. But this 
program has meant everything 
to me.”
The 
environment 
established 
by 
Steinberg 

and the rest of the program 
contributes to how the entire 
team plays and even how they 
act off the court.
“The way we play, we play 
together as a team so much. 
We’re 
not 
selfish 
on 
the 
court and we’re not selfish 
on the court,” Schalet said. 
“(Steinberg) has 
implemented 
that 
mindset 
to be a better 
person 
and 
I’ve 
built 
so 
many 
great 
relationships 
that 
I’ll 
remember 
for 
the rest of my 
life.”
Other 
victories at singles included 
a 6-1, 6-1 victory from junior 
Connor Johnston and Fenty, 
who won 7-5, 7-6 (5).Tishman 
won his singles match as 
well, defeating his opponent, 
6-1, 7-5. His win gave the 
Wolverines their fourth point 
for the match and sealed the 
victory for Michigan, showing 
Tishman’s ability to lead by 
example as captain of the 
team, along with Schalet.
“This year we knew 
we 
would 
have 
our 
hands full from the 
beginning, because we 
graduated four seniors 
and got four freshman 
in and the majority of 
our team is made up 
of 
underclassmen,” 
Tishman said. “I think 
taking on the role of 
captain with Myles has 
taught me a lot. It’s 
taught me to take the 
high 
road 
sometimes 
and when to get on some 
people. But it’s all out 
of love, and everybody 
understands 
that. 
They’ve been a great 
team to lead.”
And 
come 
next 
season, Michigan will 
have to find two other 
players to replace the 
leadership of Schalet 
and Tishman.

G

aining a solid foundation in 
grammar was one of the hall-
marks of my 10 years attend-
ing Catholic school. Every year, from first 
grade to eighth grade, there was a class 
dedicated solely to grammar, a 45-min-
ute block of time each day dedicated to 
learning the intricacies of the English lan-
guage. While most other schools include 
grammar as a unit in the all-encompass-
ing “language arts” class curriculum, my 
school gave it the attention it deserved.
We had both a textbook and workbook 
for the class, with nightly homework in 
each. While many of my classmates bris-
tled at the repeated instruction of nouns, 
verbs, adverbs and adjectives, believing it 
to be redundant and unnecessary, I found 
grammar class to be the best part of my 
day. I loved the challenge of continually 
trying to master the complexities con-
tained in learning grammar. There were 
always new concepts to learn, year after 
year. Dangling participles. Collective 
nouns. Passive voice.
Even the standard concepts underlying 
the language needed continuous atten-
tion; with grammar, there was always 
more work to be done. There were always 
new situations for which to apply the 
concepts, and every situation presented 
unexpected complications that made it 
different from another sentence. It was a 
never-ending quest to master the mate-
rial, and I enjoyed every second of that 
journey.
All those years of grammar class 
instilled in me an unconditional love of 
all things commas, appositives and semi-
colons. Having good grammar became an 
integral part of my identity, and I jumped 
at any chance to express that characteris-
tic. I would help my mom with grammar 
questions in her marketing presentations, 
ensuring there were no glaring errors in 
her sentences. I would edit my sister’s col-
lege papers for grammar. I would (some-
times) correct my parents when they used 
“who” instead of “whom,” at great annoy-
ance to them. I would mark my class-
mates’ papers full of comments in English 
class, pointing out every little deviation 
from the rigidity of grammar I could find.
It gave me great pleasure to flex my 
grammar muscles, and doing so made me 
a better speaker and writer. Unfortunate-
ly, many of these muscles atrophied dur-

ing my time in high school, as I didn’t have 
a class or activity in which to use them. 
That part of my identity lay dormant, 
waiting to be put to good use. And I found 
that good use when I joined the copy desk 
at The Michigan Daily.
When I showed up at The Daily my first 
semester of freshman year, I didn’t really 
know what I wanted to do at the paper. 
I planned on applying to News because 
it seemed like the “cool thing” to do, but 
I wasn’t so keen on the idea of covering 
events and interviewing attendees; I like 
working behind the scenes more. I didn’t 
think I had the people skills required 
for beat reporting, and I felt as though it 
would take me too far out of my comfort 
zone.
I had almost resigned myself to leaving 
The Daily without finding a role when I 
heard the copy chief start to speak. The 
minute I heard the words “grammar” 

and “editing” come out of her mouth, my 
ears perked up. Here was just the chance 
I desired to reorient myself with my true 
love: correct grammar. At the sight of 
the pre-test, I was instantly transported 
back to the good old days of middle school 
grammar class. I dived into those ques-
tions with a sense of eagerness and happi-
ness that I hadn’t found being stuck in the 
doldrums of distribution classes. I knew 
then that I found an outlet to channel my 
grammar energies (without annoying my 
parents).
I was beyond overjoyed to learn I was 
selected to be on the Copy team last Octo-
ber, and my joy has only increased in the 
past two semesters. Being on Copy has 
made me proud. While there would be no 
paper without the content sections, there 
would be no readable paper without the 
Copy section. Though our work may not 
be considered “sexy,” and we don’t get to 

put our name on the articles like writers 
do, our work is no less important.
We maintain The Daily’s journalistic 
integrity by ensuring the statistics cited 
in articles are accurate and represent the 
situation correctly. We certify students 
don’t have their names misspelled or their 
student organizations mischaracterized, 
avoiding students from being turned off 
by our work. And, most important of all, 
we make sure the paper is stylish; that is, 
there are no grammar errors and reading 
it aloud would sound pleasing to the ear.
In short, Copy smooths out the rough 
edges that can come with writing and 
makes The Daily the beautiful final prod-
uct you can find in many campus build-
ings. I am glad to be a part of that process 
every week, knowing that I can use my 
grammar knowledge for something posi-
tive.

Copy that: Turning my passion into reality

“Congratulations, you won!” have become 
words to fear in the age of robocalls. Nearly 
every cell phone owner is familiar with the 
feeling of answering what looks like a local 
number, but hearing a cold, robotic voice 
awarding us a free Hawaiian cruise, or 
warning us of a vendetta from the IRS.
When taken for face value, robocalls seem 
to exist for the sole purpose of malicious 
irritation, but a closer look reveals that they 
have slithered their way underneath the 
innocuous umbrella of direct marketing, 
becoming 
the 
evil 
stepbrother 
of 
advertisement catalogs and emails.
While direct marketing is governed under 
three levels of regulation (federal, state and 
local), there is a thin line to cross before 
abusing the luxury of direct marketing — 
thin enough for businesses to have to consult 
attorneys just to engage in legitimate direct 
marketing practices, such as delivering sales 
pitches through mail, phone or email.
Robocalls have been a source of nuisance, 
deception and con artists for decades. In 
1991, the federal government passed the 
Telephone Consumer Protection Act to 
regulate telemarketers and attempt to 
terminate fraudulent activity. It prohibited 
solicitation by autodialers, unsolicited fax 
marketing, calls before 8 a.m. and after 9 
p.m., and calls to those who have indicated 
they would not like to be called again. The 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission 
does not award mercy to those who violate 
the TCPA. Last year, the FCC slapped a 
$120 million fine on Adrian Abramovich 
of Miami, who flooded consumers with 97 
million phone calls promoting illegitimate 
travel deals using an autodialer. It was the 
largest fine to date.
But 
even 
more 
powerful 
than 
the FCC’s newly found authority to 
regulate telemarketers is the consumer 
empowerment 
that 
came 
with 
the 
legislation: TCPA also gave consumers a 
way to personally pursue a case against a 
telemarketer that they believe has violated 
the law. An individual can earn up to $500 
per violation that they have experienced, 
and if caught by the FTC, telemarketers can 
be liable for $10,000 per violation. 
But being caught is a tough bet in the 
industry. Because small illegal operations 
either run on anonymity or are based 
overseas, tracking robocallers’ assets is 
one of the biggest pain points in trying to 
stop this fraudulent practice. Many times, 
operations are so small that, when fined, 
they are unable to even pay the full penalty. 
As of three weeks ago, the FCC announced 
that they have fined robocallers $208 
million, but have only been able to collect 
$6,790.
With the TCPA now being the No. 1 
lawsuit filed in the U.S., comedian John 
Oliver has a point: Hatred of robocalls may 
just be “the only thing everyone in America 
agrees on.” But the problem is only getting 

worse. According to Robocall Index, 
there are roughly 170 million robocalls 
made per day, and it continues on an 
incline. Mobile scam calls made up 
3.7 percent of total calls in 2017, 29.2 
percent in 2018, and that number is 
now projected to reach roughly 45 
percent before the end of this year.
But robocalls are not solely used 
for deception: We rely on automated 
calls from our hospitals and dentists 
reminding 
us 
of 
appointments, 
pharmacies 
notifying 
us 
about 
medication refills, school districts 
announcing snow days and banks 
alerting us of fraud. And while 
federal law requires that companies 
cannot conduct robocalls without 
giving consent, most of us have opted 
into them without realizing it — in 
the lengthy terms of service box 
we habitually check before using a 
product or service. 
Nevertheless, the robocall ratio 
of necessary to unnecessary is 
remarkably lopsided. In the pursuit 
to combat robocalls and profit, 
cell phone providers (e.g. AT&T, 
Verizon Wireless) and third party 
apps (e.g. Nomorobo, Hiya) are 
charging monthly fees to help fend off 
robocallers. They detect repeating-
digit numbers (i.e. 222-222-2222), 
numbers with more than 10 digits, 
and, the latest tactic, neighborhood 
spoofing: 
suspiciously 
similar 
phone 
numbers to those of our neighbors.
The 
annoyance 
of 
robocalls 
has 
expanded to our inboxes with the rise of 
email. In 2003, the federal government 
also cracked down on unsolicited emails 
by passing legislation called “Controlling 
the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography 
and Marketing Act,” or CAN-SPAM. While 
the government was originally relaxed 
about email marketing due to its free 
receipt, easy discarding and legalphysical 
mailbox spam, it began cracking down on 
misleading emails, demanding only truthful 
and straightforward content in order to 
prevent spam from turning to scam. That 
same year, robo regulation continued as the 
government established a national Do Not 
Call registry.
Despite more entities cracking down 
and more legislation being passed, the fact 
of the matter is that becoming a robocaller 
and getting away with it is fairly simple. 
Downloading 
software 
only 
requires 
internet access and a computer, and the cost 
is typically less than a penny per call.
And while scammers can see windfalls 
when consumers naively fork over their 
credit card numbers to purchase illegitimate 
services, they can also make incremental 
income just by calling phone numbers that 
provide caller ID. These IDs originate from 
databases that try to identify who is calling, 

and when a caller’s name is displayed, phone 
companies pay small fees to databases 
that store the names, and occasionally to 
the caller himself as well. These fees can 
sometimes even be enough to offset the cost 
of making the calls in the first place.
While we can appreciate the government’s 
endeavors to double down on this issue, 
there is another layer of complexity to 
consider: the honest victims who get caught 
in the fishnet.
Since the TCPA is what’s called a strict 
liability statute, one harmless mistake 
can result in a violation — no exceptions. 
And since 100,000 phone numbers are 
reassigned every day, it isn’t hard for well-
intentioned companies to accidentally call 
the “wrong person,” or rather, the new 
owner of a subscribing phone number. If the 
new call recipient brings the call to court, it 
could cost the company.
Three weeks ago, Roger Meiners, a 
professor at University of Texas-Arlington, 
proposed a novel solution that quickly 
gained traction online: the “Penny for 
Sanity Tax” or a 1-cent tax on every call 
made. The five billion robocalls made this 
past year would cost $50 million — a notable 
government incentive to act. Because 
targeting individual robocallers is virtually 
impossible, the tax would apply to all calls 
to affect any caller in the U.S., robo or 
real. Because society is moving away from 
frequent calling, the tax would hardly affect 

common man’s wallet. The average adult 
makes six calls a day, meaning a mere $1.80 
a month. Once you get past the idea of yet 
another tax, this could be our silver bullet.
While the FCC works day and night to 
combat this incessant issue, it came to a 
head last week when federal investigators 
unearthed Operation Brace Yourself, one of 
the biggest health care scams in U.S. history, 
amounting to $1.2 billion. The Department 
of Justice has charged 24 people from New 
Jersey to California after telemarketers 
in the Philippines and Latin America 
advertised “free” orthopedic braces to 
those newly eligible for Medicare in the U.S. 
Doctors deliberately wrote prescriptions for 
braces that patients never asked for, and sold 
the prescriptions to brace manufacturers 
who then billed Medicare anywhere $500 
to $900 for each brace. After processing, 
doctors were given kickbacks of roughly 
$300 per brace. Needless to say, it did not 
pay off.
Whether it’s through the Penny for 
Sanity Tax or another round of legislation, 
robocalls may remain the FCC’s top priority 
for a while.
You can protect yourself from robocalls 
by signing up your mobile phone on the Do 
Not Call Registry at www.donotcall.gov, 
and refraining from answering any phone 
number that mimics the first 4-6 digits of 
your phone number.

The business case for robocalls

“In-State”: A reflection on the U.P., its students and the 
University of Michigan

People 
in Houghton, a town 
in the Upper Peninsula, only 
wake up at 4 a.m. to do one of three 
things: plow snow, watch the sunrise or 
catch one of the two daily flights from Houghton 
County Memorial Airport to Chicago O’Hare.
My intention to watch the sunrise drew me 
to wake up at 4 a.m. in July 2017. I gathered 
my siblings to drive “up north” — an hour drive 
maximum or you’ll end up in Lake Superior — to Bare 
Bluff, a hike looking east over the lake. Our little pack 
hiked all the way to the top of the bluff, looked out on the calm 
freshwater and watched the sun slowly illuminate the trees.
Many at the University of Michigan consider Traverse City 
or Mackinac Island to be “up north,” but for us in Houghton, 
that’s not the real “up north.” For us, the real “up north” is the 
Keweenaw Peninsula and the beautiful sunrise that comes 
up on Bare Bluff, over Superior’s horizon. When introducing 
myself to other University students, I take pride in telling them 
that I’m from the U.P. I mention the 300 inches of snow from 
the previous year, describe the beautiful landscapes and detail 
the two-hour drive to Target and my orthodontist’s office in 
Marquette.
While the U.P. is my original home, the University has 
become my second one. I have found comfort here at the 
University over time, becoming accustomed to walking the 
campus, watching sporting events, going to class and working 
at The Daily. Houghton, my home in the U.P., will always be 
comfortable, but here at the University, I have found comfort 
along with opportunity — professional, academic and social. 
The footprint of the University extends across the globe, and 
the faculty and resources are world-renowned with a massive 
student body of students from across the U.S. and the world.
But as a premier institution of higher education, founded 
with the goal of providing opportunity to college-aged 
students in the state of Michigan, how does the University 
associate with prospective students in the U.P.? How does 
the University breach the geographical divide to reach U.P. 
students who are so far away? How does it help them once they 
are at the University? What role does the University have as 
the state’s flagship institution?
These two communities are certainly different. The 
University and greater Ann Arbor is far more liberal, relatively 
more diverse and certainly less snow-laden. The Upper 
Peninsula, which has 29 percent of the landmass in the state 
but just 3 percent of the population, is isolated from the rest 
of the state by the Mackinac Bridge. Many U.P. residents live 
closer to the capital of Wisconsin than to Lansing.
This relative isolation leads to limited travel and exposure, 
which can make a transition to life in Ann Arbor different for 
Yoopers. For many including myself, Ann Arbor doesn’t even 
seem like Michigan. But unlike some, I have fortunately been 
able to travel and gain exposure to life in urban areas with 
diverse populations. The culture shock of a more liberal, larger, 
diverse Ann Arbor was a learning curve, but the adjustment 
period for me was short.
W

hen I submitted my deposit to the University of 
Michigan, I’d only seen the campus once, at night. 
I visited a family friend in 2013 and we watched 
Trey Burke hit the game-tying three against Kansas in the 
Elite Eight. Later, I figured out we watched in a lounge in Alice 
Lloyd Residence Hall and shouted, “Go Blue!” at every person 
in the Diag. But other than those four hours, I hadn’t seen the 

University 
— not even in 
daylight.
Three months later, my mom dropped 
me off at East Quad Residence Hall for freshman 
orientation. I nervously joked I should have gone to 
Michigan Technological University in my hometown. 
That day, I wondered why I chose the University. I’d 
seen Washington University in St. Louis in the daylight, I’d 
strolled around what George Washington University can 
call a campus in the middle of Washington D.C. Hell, I’d even 
walked around the University of Virginia over a high school 
winter break. So why was I being dropped off for my freshman 
orientation in Ann Arbor?
Part of it was cost-benefit analysis — the University was 
by far the cheapest option and either a better school or an 
equal one to all the ones I listed above (though I could have 
celebrated a national basketball championship this year if I’d 
gone to Virginia). I also knew I wanted a school that didn’t 
make me feel like I still lived in Michigan, so the University 
made sense because Ann Arbor felt so different from the 
Michigan I knew and it still allowed me to pay in-state tuition 
at a world-class university.
I knew that the University had a broad scope of resources 
and opportunities in every possible academic field, which 
allowed me to take a shot in the dark when I submitted my 
enrollment deposit. I knew if I somehow wanted to switch into 
engineering, I’d enter a top-five program. I ultimately ended 
up in the Ford School of Public Policy, which has graduate 
programs ranked first in public policy analysis. But I realized 
the consequences of my shot-in-the-dark decision when the 
culture shock finally hit at East Quad in mid-July, and later 
again at South Quad Residence Hall in early August. It was 
more a realization I was outside of my comfort zone, but I 
credit much of my eventual adjustment to the University to my 
parents, who took great lengths to travel and visit family when 
we were kids.
My story is one of many Upper Peninsula students going to 
college, here at the University or anywhere else in the state 
and the country.
I

n thinking about U.P. students and the University, I 
immediately thought of my friend David Alger. Alger 
was one of our three high school valedictorians, and 
was admitted to the College of Engineering at the University. 
But despite his admittance, Alger currently studies chemical 
engineering at Michigan Tech in the Houghton area where we 
grew up.
Alger is the quintessential Yooper. On his Instagram, you 
can find photos of beautiful areas he’s hiked, massive fish 
he’s caught and even a couple deer he’s snagged on opening 
day of hunting season, often in a few feet of snow. Now, I 
personally like to hike, and fishing seems fun, but Alger takes 
these activities and others to the peak of an outdoorsman. 
His answer to why he chose Michigan Tech and the U.P. was 
simple — don’t leave what you love.
“I really loved living here, and still love it,” Alger said. “That 
was a huge part of it. I didn’t want to move away.”
Too often, U.P. students are eager to move away and fail 
to recognize opportunity in the U.P., especially at Michigan 
Tech. In my experience, other students I’ve met from my 
area find an allure outside of the U.P. One girl in my driver’s 
ed class even asked what my favorite New York City borough 

was, clearly dreaming of living in the Big Apple. But Alger 
recognized the opportunities he had at home through 
Michigan Tech, including the Leading Scholar Award at 
Michigan Tech, which, according to the Michigan Tech 
website, “Recognizes resident and non-resident high school 
seniors who have demonstrated outstanding leadership and 
scholarly achievements both in and outside the classroom.”
“Knowing that I get the scholarship that I already had got at 
Tech and then I’d come into Tech knowing everything about 
the campus (helped me decide),” Alger said. “And having a 
bunch of connections there already. And that kind of weighed 
in my head like saying, ‘OK, I’m not going to have to spend 
the time to develop all those things and to try and pay for my 
school if I just go to Tech and it’s still a really good education.’”
Thanks in part to his valedictorian status, David received 
this full-ride scholarship to Tech in the town he loved. 
Money certainly makes these decisions easier, but David also 
recognizes the social aspects that went into his choice.
“And certainly I figured Tech would be a better fit for me 
culturally than Michigan would be, just being who I am,” 
Alger said. “Along those lines, a small town kid is going to be a 
small town kid. You could try and throw him somewhere, but 
if he’s really a small town kid, it’s not going to go too well.”
When I came to the University, I made friends with other 
students in my residence hall, and met students from across 
campus in the Roosevelt Institute. Ann Arbor might not be 
so big for students from New York and California, but it has 
roughly 15 times as many people as Houghton does. In Alger’s 
case, the University missed out on an outstanding student for 
cultural, social and personal reasons.
Additionally, the earning potential and career potential 
needs to be noted in Alger’s decision. According to the 
Michigan Tech Admissions Office, Tech graduates are in the 
90th percentice of early career salaries and currently, Tech 
graduates earn a median starting salary of $66,400. Through 
his studies at Tech and the resources available, Alger has 
landed an internship with manufacturer Georgia-Pacific, 
which will likely become a full-time opportunity post-grad.
Alger’s 
girlfriend, 
Rachel 
Fuller, 
a 
second-year 
environmental engineering student at Tech, is from Brighton 
in the Lower Peninsula and also had an opportunity to come 
to the University, but chose Michigan Tech coming out of 
community college for financial reasons and personal ones.
“I liked the culture more (of Tech),” Fuller said. “I was given 
more opportunities and better scholarships up here than at 
Michigan … I just kind of always had a problem with living 
in tight cities. With Ann Arbor, the population there is just so 
compact and crazy that I didn’t really like that type of ‘busy all 
the time’ lifestyle.”
Fuller referenced the constant busyness and pressure 
dynamic that other U.P. students and students from other 
universities are acutely aware of at the University. This and 
the more outdoorsy nature of Michigan Tech pushed her to 
the U.P.
I

n contrast with Alger and Fuller, there are many U.P. 
students who do choose to study here at the University 
— I sought them out in our “Marquette Wolverines” 
Facebook group. Olivia Anderson is a junior at the University 
studying history and communication studies. Hailing from 
Munising, a smaller town three hours east of Houghton, 
Anderson saw the University’s size as a benefit.
“I … hated how small like U.P. communities are,” Anderson 
said. “The kind of bubble effect that happens in the U.P. is 
something that really bothers me. And when I came to Ann 
Arbor it reminded me a lot of ... Madison (Wis.). It reminded 
me a lot more of that vibe where there’s a lot of people and stuff 
to do. It just clicked for me more rather than other places I’ve 
visited.”

Anderson also highlighted her desire to experience more 
diversity and be a part of a more progressive community. 
While many in Ann Arbor term the city a “bubble” that is 
not representative of “the real world,” the U.P. bubble also 
exists in isolation. Made up of relatively homogenous white, 
conservative communities, the U.P. can seem to be reluctant to 
change at times, especially in towns that lack higher education 
institutions such as Michigan Tech and Northern Michigan 
University.
“Especially for me, being from an area that doesn’t have 
a lot of high academic achievement, is that there’s a lot of 
pressure here,” Anderson said. “There is an insane amount of 
pressure that can’t be matched anywhere else. I feel like, and 
it might just be a thing about where I’m from, but I just haven’t 
experienced something like this. And even talking to friends 
that go to Tech or go to Northern or just anything like that, 
they don’t get it.”
I’ve heard this account from other students, no matter if 
they’re from the U.P. or the East Coast. This is reality on a high-
achieving college campus, but Matthew Knudsen, a junior at 
the University studying molecular and cellular biology, didn’t 
agree.
Knudsen is a fourth-generation University of Michigan 
student who grew up going to football games at the Big House. 
He hails from Escanaba in the southern U.P., and when asked 
about pressure at the University, he claimed it didn’t affect him 
as much.
“I don’t know about that,” Knudsen said. “I think it’s just so 
much bigger than those U.P. colleges. The only difference I can 
speak on is that you get to meet people from all over.”
Knudsen runs the Yooper Club at the University and lives 
with a few other U.P. students, but appreciates the opportunity 
to meet students from every state in the country. And while 
he and Anderson disagree on the pressure at the University, 
they both know students who had the chance to attend the 
University but decided not to.
“I’ve heard from people who had the ability to come here or 
applied to come here who are accepted and they’re just, ‘I’m 
glad I didn’t go,’” Anderson said.
“My best friend got into Michigan and he’s at Iowa instead,” 
Knudsen said. “It’s another Big Ten school, and the only reason 
he didn’t come to Michigan is because he got a full-ride at Iowa 
… Maybe one girl from my class ended at Central, but financial 
reasons again.”
Interviews with Alger, Fuller, Anderson and Knudsen 
showed the variation of interests and experiences U.P. students. 
They showed the University doesn’t click for everyone and 
that’s OK. But for the students who do wish to come to the 
University, what does the future hold?
I 

interviewed two high school counselors in the Upper 
Peninsula to discuss past interactions with the 
University: Susy Talentino of Sault Ste. Marie in the 
eastern U.P. and Kristen Rundman, my high school counselor 
in Houghton.
Talentino and Rundman both had positive things to say 
about the University but noted its academic rigor. Talentino 
highlighted a lack of recruiting of Sault Ste. Marie students.
“Academic quality, of course, the attitude is that it’s high,” 
Talentino said. “U-M has tough admission standards. As far 
as recruiting, we don’t really have any recruiting. We used to 
have a U-M admissions adviser come here sometimes, but we 
haven’t had them come in several years.”
“I think that it’s a very challenging school and diverse, it has 
a diverse population,” Rundman said. “And prepares students 
well for their future.”
Recruiting at Sault Ste. Marie has slowed, but the 
University still typically sends a representative to a college 
fair in Houghton each year. However, Rundman noted the 

college fair is typically an extremely busy time and it’s hard 
for students to interface with University representatives. 
Because of geographic distance, traveling to the U.P. takes 
a toll for University representatives. However, the lack of 
representatives poses a problem as the University misses out 
on talented U.P. students.
I did not meet with a representative my senior year and 
most of my information came from the internet and mailers 
I received at home. However, meeting with someone from the 
University could have reduced the “impostor syndrome” I felt 
with my acceptance to the University. Impostor syndrome is 
a horrible little thing where you feel you don’t deserve to be 
somewhere or in some position or have some achievement. For 
me, meeting with a representative would have greatly reduced 
this, but I had to wait until I settled in at the University for 
it to go away (of course, these things never completely go 
away). While I pushed through this mental block, the failure 
of the University recruiting could be damaging other students’ 
opportunities, which is something Talentino noted in her 
experiences.
“I feel that it maybe makes some kids feel like U-M isn’t 
really an option because no one really comes to talk to them 
about it,” Talentino said.
The University might rely on the Student Ambassadors 
program to cover this ground. The program involves training 
current University students, giving them a PowerPoint 
presentation and having them speak at their high school alma 
mater. But this relies on current U-M students going back to 
their high schools, so U.P. high schools with no students at 
the University suffer. Anderson mentioned previous students 
from her school going to the University were unwilling to 
share their experiences with their hometowns.
“I had two people from my high school before me and the 
people I knew graduating that came here and they just, they 
exed out completely of their own community,” Anderson said. 
“They … went to the University of Michigan. No one ever heard 
from them again. And I just went in completely blind here.”
If University students from the U.P. and other under-
contacted areas aren’t willing to go back to their hometowns, 
the Student Ambassadors program will prove to be 
ineffective. Because of this, students in the U.P., 
with its isolation, might not feel ready or up to the 
challenge of the University. Missing out on visits from 
representatives because of hectic schedules, or not 
hearing from a former peer about their experience 
inhibits the confidence of U.P. students and their 
likelihood of enrolling downstate at the University.
Talentino had an admissions case where a student 
she thought was well qualified was denied admission 
to the University.
“One that still bothers me is a class of 2017 boy 
who applied to U-M. He had a 4.0 and a really good 
SAT score, I think it was 13-something,” Talentino 
said. “And he did not get in and when he told me, I 
said, ‘I don’t believe you, you screwed something up. 
Like, you did not click submit on your application or 
something’, and he said, ‘No, I’m telling you the truth’, 
and he forwarded me the email he got declining, telling 
him he didn’t get in. So I’m still floored by that. As a 
counselor, I see U-M as very competitive as far as being 
admitted.”
With an increasing number of applicants, admission 
to the University is becoming more of a crapshoot. 
Talentino also detailed a perceived advantage for U.P. 
students that has seemingly fallen by the wayside.
“And I feel like there used to be that kind of 
legend that if you were from an Upper Peninsula 
county, your chances of getting into U-M were 

better because U-M needed kids from all areas,” Talentino 
said. “That U-M needed kids from rural areas in the U.P. to 
kind of fill out their, ‘Yes, we are getting kids from all areas 
of the state.’ But lately, it kind of seems like that’s not as true 
anymore.”
A University of Michigan admissions counselor was reached 
out to for comment but was unable to do so.
The undergraduate population of students at the University 
from the state of Michigan is 16,036. If its student body 
were to be representative of the state in terms of population 
distribution, then the University should have nearly 500 U.P. 
students. It’s unlikely enrollment at the University reaches 
that number, given Talentino and Rundman both estimated 
their schools produce between one and 10 U-M students per 
year. The Universityt does not provide specific admissions 
statistics for students from the U.P. Far more U.P. students 
go to the U.P. schools like Lake Superior State in Sault Ste. 
Marie or Northern Michigan in Marquette or Michigan 
Tech in Houghton. Rundman noted the growing popularity 
of community colleges because of the high cost of four-year 
institutions.
T

here are no other examples of a state with a top 
nationally-ranked institution of higher learning that 
has this isolated a population, and simply no one at 
the University talks about it. Few students have actually been 
to the U.P., but it’s there. Its people, its culture, its politics — 
nearly completely surrounded by water and tucked away in 
forests, hills and plains. Some of its students stay home and get 
an education, others go straight to work and a few come to the 
University of Michigan. If the University can figure out how 
to offer more financial aid and perhaps changed a “pressure” 
and 
“busy” 
culture, maybe it can snag more of 
them.

BY FINNTAN STORER, MANAGING EDITOR


I 

have heard it all. About how there’s 
nothing in the world quite like 
walking to Michigan Stadium with 
your friends on game days — when jubi-
lant music floods the streets and Ann 
Arbor is indisputably wide awake. About 
hunching over crinkled papers and half-
finished lattes in the library late at night. 
About the fading intensity of homesick-
ness as you find the friends that’ll speak 
at your wedding someday and the growing 
sense of who you are meant to be.
With conviction and nostalgia, my 
teachers, neighbors and older friends 
promised, “It’ll be the best years of your 
life.”
The best years of my life.
As the first person in my family to 
attend college in the United States, I was 
both very impressionable and cautiously 
optimistic about college. However, as 
I stood on the steps of Angell Hall and 
read the words “the means of education 
shall forever be encouraged,” learned 
from professors who are nothing short of 
experts in their respective fields and pas-
sionately sang the fight song at my first 
home football game, I couldn’t help but 
believe those words. After all, how could 
it possibly get any better? It truly felt like 
I was on the brink of something extraor-
dinary.
However, my college experience large-
ly deviated from what my friends and 
teachers had recounted. There was an 
unexpected and acute loneliness that 
pulled at the hem of my jeans just about 
everywhere I went. After just a few weeks 
of walking to class, staring at my blank 
phone during rushed meals in the dining 
hall, and exchanging empty words with 
my roommate, I found myself reaching 
for my earbuds more and more often — 
not for the music, but simply to drown out 
that dreaded feeling of loneliness.
Like most freshmen, perhaps, I decided 
I needed to put myself out there and get 
out of my comfort zone if I wanted to 
meet people. So I sat down and scrolled 
through Maize Pages religiously to fill 
out countless applications for clubs. One, 
in particular, was for a pre-medicine fra-
ternity, founded on the pillars of service 
and leadership and on the passion for 
medicine.
The organization and its members 
embodied everything I wanted for my 
future. I pored myself over that applica-
tion — citing years of involvement in vari-
ous clubs from my high school career. I 
remember picking out my favorite yel-
low blouse, meticulously flat-ironing my 
unruly hair just to pull it back into a neat 
plait, and rehearsing exactly what I want-
ed say. But when my interviewers looked 
like they were trying to keep their heads 
from flopping over from boredom during 
my responses, I walked out of Angell Hall 

feeling more than defeated. Just a month 
earlier, I had stared up at the promising 
words at the top of that very building, 
filled with hope and enthusiasm.
And when the rejection finally came via 
email, it felt like a door was shutting right 
in my face — like an entire group of people 
told me I wasn’t enough. Alas, there I was 
again: trapped and pushed into a corner 
with my dear loneliness.
The rest of that first semester of col-
lege followed much of the same pattern. I 
desperately tried out for everything I was 
even remotely intrigued by. An Indian 
dance team, an a cappella singing group, 
more medical clubs. Each one responded 
with a resounding “no.”
I couldn’t help but feel confused. Of all 
the people that had told me about what 
college would be like, not one had men-
tioned feeling inadequate or alone. For 
a long time, I thought I must be the only 
person who felt this way. That miscon-
ception didn’t change until a close friend 
confided in me that she would feel the 
same way even after a night partying with 
a whole group of people. Slowly, I began to 
see how pervasive and typical these feel-
ings of loneliness and inadequacy really 
are, and a bigger picture began to unrav-
el. Now, I can’t help but feel obligated to 
speak to the gaping hole in the narrative 
I had heard about the college experience.
The best years of my life.
Though it may look different for each 
person, so many people experience this 
period of instability. After all, college is 
full of change, and the road 
to figuring out who you’re 
meant to be isn’t always 
glamorous. 
Self-discovery 
can be a ferociously grueling 
process that forces us to look 
our scariest inner demons in 
the eye.
I didn’t come to this real-
ization until I headed home 
for 
Winter 
Break. 
After 
a stressful round of final 
exams and nagging feelings 
of loneliness and inadequacy 
buzzing in my ear for the past 
few months, I was so grateful 
to be surrounded by my fam-
ily. When I finally opened up 
to my parents about how dif-
ficult my first semester was, 
my dad reminded me of a 
story I knew all too well.
When I was just 2 years 
old, my family moved to the 
United States from India. On 
my first day of kindergarten, 
I stared with wide eyes at 
my teachers and fellow stu-
dents — not comprehending 
a single word. My teacher 
actually met with my parents 

to express concern about my English 
language ability. Worried, my mother 
would sit with me each day as I forced 
my tongue to make strange new sounds 
and memorized the curves of a foreign 
alphabet. I remember being so frustrated 
that I would throw my pencil across the 
room — refusing to learn anymore. Ever 
so patiently, my mother would coax the 
pencil back into my hands and assure me 
that the language would come naturally 
to me soon because our ancestors in India 
were writers. She gently insisted I had the 
strength in me to thrive in this foreign 
place. Soon enough, I was spewing Eng-
lish as fluently as Samantha from next 
door — more naturally than my native 
Telugu, even.
By the time I got to middle school, I 
was writing poems and stories. With his 
crinkling brown eyes and graying hair, my 
dad offered, “You’re like Hanuman. You 
don’t know your own strength.” I smiled, 
remembering the ancient Hindu stories 
about a man that didn’t know he had the 
strength to lift mountains or the creative 
intelligence of an inventor unless some-
one told him so. 
My dad’s reminder of my own strength 
stuck with me. When I returned to cam-
pus for winter semester, I wrote his exact 
words on a piece of paper and stuck them 
to my dorm wall. I didn’t want to forget 
them. Most importantly, I wanted to live 
by them.
So, I was more kind to myself. I relished 
victories and failures alike, heeding that 

each would help me in some way. And even 
though I started to carve my own niche on 
campus, I told myself that I shouldn’t be 
afraid of not knowing where I fit in or not 
feeling like I am enough. I realized my 
dad was right. It is during the most trying 
of times that you discover your purpose 
and some of your greatest strengths — 
things you’ve always had within yourself.
Of course, success is all the more 
gratifying when you can appreciate and 
acknowledge every struggle that you 
fought to overcame. Thus, I choose to 
acknowledge the loneliness and confusion 
that colored much of my first semester. I 
know that somewhere in the future, I will 
be grateful for the challenges my fresh-
man year posed and how they pushed me 
to discover more about myself.
Already, I am at a point where the blar-
ing loneliness has quieted down and I am 
comfortable simply being with myself. I 
learned to enjoy my own company. It is 
this firm awareness and acceptance of the 
struggles embedded in the college experi-
ence that allowed me to embrace every 
extraordinary opportunity that college 
has to offer.
I wish more than anything that some-
one had told me, “You might feel alone 
and lost, and that’s OK. You are not alone. 
Treasure those experiences.” I am persis-
tently optimistic that this thread of truth 
can help stitch together a more realistic 
picture about the college experience and 
remind anyone who needs to hear it, “You 
are strong enough.”

A love letter to “U”

I 

decided to go to the University 
of Michigan without ever hav-
ing stepped foot on this campus. I 
had a really good feeling about it, and for 
some reason, my gut knew. I loved what 
people had to say about U-M grads — that 
they are wicked smart and successful, but 
also extremely friendly, kind and humble. 
From the beginning, I was sure it was 
something I wanted to be a part of.
I saw this campus for the first time when 
I arrived for orientation. I knew so little 
about the University that I asked someone 
where the center of campus was, and for a 
while, I thought it was the engineering arch 
by the South University Espresso Royale. I 
arrived here by myself, without knowing a 
single soul, and ready to start my new life.
Sometimes, I think the reason why I 
especially loved college was because I was 
ready to leave high school and my booger-
sized, suffocating suburban town in New 
Jersey. It was the kind of bubble where 
every generation came back and did exact-
ly what their parents did. I was tired of 
nonsensical drama and of not growing as a 
person. College, to me, wasn’t just a place 
to get a degree. It was my chance to finally 
become the person I wanted to be but had 
hidden in constant fear of being judged. It 
was the promised land where I could start 
new, make friends and learn, learn, learn.
My first semester, I was having so 
much fun meeting people and getting to 
know my new home that my mom texted 
me two months in, asking if I was alive. 
I had completely absorbed into my new 
life of classes, friends and tailgates. Now 
as a graduating senior, I think back on 
how every day, even with the difficult and 

stressful ones, has been so exciting. As I 
write this, with 27 days left, I still wake up 
every single morning in disbelief that I get 
to be a student here.
It honestly makes me angry, after all 
the waiting I did to get to college, that this 
experience is already coming to an end. 
A lot of my friends at other colleges say 
they’re ready to graduate, but I am heart-
broken at the thought of ever having to 
leave. I want more time here. I want to go 
to Charley’s trivia a couple more nights 
and attend one more basketball game. I 
want to have one more movie night over 
feta bread and one more long run as the 
leaves around the Diag start to change col-
ors in the fall. I’ll even take another exam 
to stay here for a minute longer.
It’s been pretty terrifying and miser-
able to watch the days go by during my 
senior year. Friends that I chose to be my 
family for the past four years are signing 
leases and confirming start dates for their 
jobs all across the world. I won’t be able to 
simply call them up for lunch or see them 
every single day in class. We won’t be see-
ing Main Street at sunset or deliriously 
giggling in the UGLi at 3 a.m. I try to con-
stantly remind myself that it’s a good thing 
I’m devastated about graduating. It means 
I really built something special here.
So other than this being a tale of woe, 
this is my thank you to all the people who 
have made these past four years the most 
special and happiest of my life.
Each and every one of you has filled me 
with more love and support than I could’ve 
ever imagined or thought I deserved. I 
cannot wait to see where you will all go, 
because I know you’re going to be doing 

impactful, thought-
ful and incredible 
things. You are all 
more 
than 
just 
another person on 
this planet. You’re 
going to be leaders 
and mentors (and 
the best!). I learned 
what it truly means 
to have a commu-
nity when I came 
to college because 
of your words of 
encouragement 
and thirst for life. 
I have cherished 
our times together, 
whether it’s a messy 
night at Rick’s or 
a chat on our walk 
to class. You didn’t 
just accept me for 
my 
eccentricities, 
but also encour-
aged them to shine. 
Thank you for being the best dance part-
ners and for always making me laugh.
Your admiration of intelligence and 
creativity has inspired me to always work 
hard. We have all excelled in our own 
rights and prioritized our responsibilities 
as students, while always putting rela-
tionships first and balancing the perfect 
amount of work and fun. You have taught 
me to grind through the long hours, think 
beyond textbook material and be diligent. 
You have instilled in me ambition without 
the need to bring others down, but instead 
to value others as part of the team, the 
team, the team. Thank you for believing 
that being smart is cool, being different is 
even cooler and being kind is a necessity.
Most importantly, you have been there 
for me in my lowest points — when I was 
stressed about career choices, grades 
or life in general. You reminded me that 
everything was going to be OK, and time 
and time again it always is. We experi-
enced each other’s worst moments and 
helped each other through our mistakes. 
You were my coach, and motivated me 
through the toughest of times out of pure 
love.
Thank you for never giving up on me 
whenever I gave up on myself.
Because of all of you, I learned for the 
first time to enjoy life as it comes. I have 
become a better family member, colleague, 
stranger, friend and human being overall 
by learning from you. The compassion you 
have shown has filled me with an energy 
to only do good things in the world. I hope 
you know that even if we don’t touch base 
often, I am forever appreciative of you. The 
love you have given me has made me love 

myself, the person I’ve become in college 
and who I will grow to be in the future.
I think that’s what makes this place so 
special. It reminds me of a conversation I 
had with friends at the end of sophomore 
year about how extraordinary this place is. 
On this particular day, we had been sitting 
on the steps of the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art, enjoying a rare warm day 
with what felt like the entire population of 
Ann Arbor. Some students were playing 
frisbee outside, others were running late 
to their next class. The commotion of stu-
dent life happening all around us, through 
the stunning campus buildings and quaint 
State Street stores, created an unparal-
leled energy. We reflected on moments like 
this where we look around campus and 
think how lucky we are to attend the great-
est university in the world.
Now, as I’m at the home stretch, I see 
that it’s the people, and our belief that 
the success of another student on campus 
is a shared success, that make this place 
extraordinary. I mean, my friends cared 
so much that they would wake up early just 
to call and make sure I got up for morning 
exams. We’re bonded by this culture and 
experience that is like no other. This place 
is straight magic.
Michigan, you are my first and greatest 
love. Thank you for giving me the chance 
to meet these friends who have forever 
changed me.
This University is a classic Midwest-
ern school and is known for being amaz-
ing at sports, but it’s more than just that. 
Besides the archaic private school labels 
and beyond the sports, it’s a place where 
people excel in every field and interest 
imaginable, while also growing to be gen-
uinely good human beings. It’s a place of 
possibilities, and it’s a place that has given 
me more happiness than I’ve ever known. 
I got to spend four full years surrounded 
by endless opportunities and remarkable 
people. I now have a lifetime to think back 
on these memories, and strive to make 
more that could instill as much joy. 
Go 18-year-old me for choosing the 
University of Michigan without even visit-
ing. You knew what you were doing when 
you chose this school because you heard 
the people were good. Thank you, Mom 
and Dad, for giving me this life-changing 
opportunity, and Michigan for being the 
best decision I ever made. How fortunate 
I am to call myself a Michigan Wolverine. 
How blessed I am that no matter where I 
go, the adage is true — this campus and the 
people in it will always be my home.
And of all the beautiful cities I’ve seen, 
this is still my favorite place in the world.
How lucky I am.

“IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME FRESHMAN YEAR THAT I WOULD BE CHASING JORDAN POOLE AND THE MICHIGAN BASKETBALL TEAM 

AROUND A COURT IN WICHITA, KANSAS AND THEN SPEND THE NEXT 15 HOURS (AND MANY RED BULLS) DRIVING BACK TO ANN ARBOR, 

THEN SPEND 6 HOURS MAKING A NEWSPAPER, THEN SOMEHOW MAKING IT BACK TO MY BED, I WOULD HONESTLY NOT BELIEVE YOU. 

BECAUSE I STILL FIND HARD TO BELIEVE TODAY ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES, FRIENDS, MEMORIES AND SKILLS I HAVE GAINED 

OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS BECAUSE OF MY TIME ON PHOTOSTAFF. IT’S NOW HARD TO BELIEVE THAT MY TIME HERE ON PHOTOSTAFF IS OVER, 

BUT I KNOW IT WAS TIME WELL SPENT, AND EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT NOT BELIEVE THE MEMORIES SOMETIMES, I WILL NEVER FORGET THEM.”

“WORKING AT THE DAILY FOR THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN AMAZING. BEING ON THE PHOTO TEAM HAS GIVEN 

ME SO MANY UNIQUE EXPERIENCES THAT I'M SO THANKFUL FOR. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO 

SAY GOODBYE.”

“I’VE BEEN SUPER FORTUNATE TO SHOOT NEARLY EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN 

AND DO IT REPRESENTING THE DAILY. I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT I WAS WALKING 

INTO WHEN I JOINED, BUT I COULDN’T HAVE HOPED FOR MORE. FROM MY FIRST 

EVENT TO MY LAST, I’M PROUD TO CALL THIS NEWSPAPER MY HOME.” 

“THE DAILY HAS BEEN A SPACE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR ME, A PLACE TO MEET INTERESTING PEOPLE AND WHERE I 

FOUND SOME OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE MEASURED CHAOS OF THE 

NEWSROOM, ITS COMMUNITY AND HOW IT SERVES THE ANN ARBOR COMMUNITY AT LARGE.”

“SPENDING THE LAST THREE YEARS AS A PHOTOJOURNALIST FOR THE DAILY HAS BEEN A BLESSING. FROM THE 

FIRST WOMEN’S MARCH ON ANN ARBOR IN 2017 TO THE HASH BASH WHEN RECREATIONAL CANNABIS IN MICHI-

GAN WAS LEGALIZED, I AM SO LUCKY TO HAVE HELPED CAPTURE KEY MOMENTS OF THIS UNIVERSITY AND ANN 

ARBOR’S HISTORY. MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE EVENTS I’VE COVERED, HOWEVER, ARE THE PEOPLE I’VE MET 

THROUGHOUT MY JOURNEY. I’M GRATEFUL FOR MY FELLOW PHOTOGRAPHERS AND EDITORS WHO HAVE CHAL-

LENGED MY PERSPECTIVES, AND I’M THANKFUL THAT I COULD CONTINUE GROWING IN PHOTOGRAPHY EVEN AS A 

SENIOR. I’LL FOREVER CHERISH MY TIME HERE AT THE DAILY, AND I’M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT WILL COME NEXT.”
